President Trump and your staffing problems announces tariffs and tanks the markets and says we should give drug dealers the death penalty so things are going awesome Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show it's been a rough 48 hours for the President of the United States it has not been solid and we will go through all of the non solidity in just a second there are some real staffing issues over at the White House and chaos in terms of the internal dynamics at the White House plus the presidents of the United States Unleashed the most ignorant tweed storm I have ever seen from him and that is saying a lot here this one was on trade policy and it is just freakin a grease set mean really I met my four-year-old daughter can probably do a better explanation of trade and if it sounds like I'm being too harsh I'm being not harsh enough it's that bad so I will explain all of that again guys don't take it as though Trump's never done anything good he's done lots of good stuff but his trick up I'll get to it okay so before I get to any of that first let's say thank you to our sponsors over at Birch gold so right now you may have noticed the stock market is quite volatile it just

investing in some gold to go to birchgold.com slash Bennie's that slash Ben C at the free comprehensive kit and so that you also let them know that we sent you okay so as I mentioned the markets not having a couple of good days they're down five straight days and they've dropped in the last five days approximately a thousand points now is that the end of the world no it's not the end of the world except they dropped a thousand points the month before so one of the reasons they continued to drop is because the President of the United States does not know what the hell he is talking about on trade and I say this advice okay the president I don't know if he got his degree in from Wharton Business School on trade from turning in crackerjack box tops honestly I don't know if he got like a decoder ring in the mail I don't know where he learned his economics but it is awful it is just awful and he's actually implementing it so as I said yesterday he said a bunch of stupid crap on guns and then he's not gonna implement any of it because Congress is going to stop him on trade the president has plenary power essentially on trade because Congress has abdicated its duty over the past 50 years and given the president the ability to raise and lower tariffs essentially on his own for virtually any purpose here is what Trump tweeted out today it's really really dumb okay this is six hours ago when a country USA Thank You mr. president is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with trade wars are good and easy to win example when we are down 100 billion with a certain country and they get cute don't trade anymore we win big it's easy the levels of stupidity are like a Russian nesting doll here you open up the top level of stupidity and there's another level of stupidity beneath it except it's an infinite regress of nesting dolls because there is no tiniest nesting doll of stupidity in this tweet okay so we'll go through this sentence by sentence when he says that we are losing many billions of dollars on trade you don't lose money on trade when you go to amazon.com and you buy yourself a used book did you lose money on the trade no you voluntarily opted to buy a product when you go to a grocery store and they give you an apple and you give them 50 cents did you lose money on the trade no you bought an apple for 50 cents this is the necessity of how trade works it is a two sided exchange a voluntary consensual exchange demonstrating both that you have consented to the exchange and that you have free will over your own labor and can trade your own labor and the products of it for something else this is the magic of free trade it's not just a free trade is more efficient though it is it's also that it is more moral because you get to determine how much your labor is worth and how much your money is worth and if you don't like paying 50 cents for an Apple here you can go down the street and you can pay 40 cents for an Apple somewhere else because of competition in free trade when he says that trade deficits are necessitate trade wars and we says trade wars are good and easy to win name one name a trade war that was good and easy to win you can't win a trade war let me take my example a little bit further so you went to the grocery store and you bought a hundred dollars worth of groceries but the grocery store does not contract with you the grocery store doesn't buy anything from you the grocery store doesn't use your services because after all you're a garbage man and the grocery store doesn't need you so do well how do you retaliate against the grocery store are you angry at the grocery store because they didn't use your services and do you decide that what the best possible solution would be is to not go to Ralph's but instead to go to Gelson's where everything is twice as much and go over to Gelson's and pay twice the amount because raus isn't using you and Gelson's might is this what you're going to do or forget about whether Gelson's is using you right Gelson's may not use you either but you decide that you're gonna penalize Ralph's because Ralph's used to use you and now they're no longer using you so you decide to pay twice as much for your groceries does this make any sense if amazon.com is not hiring you as a contractor do you stop shopping at Amazon and instead go over to the local bookstore and pay twice as much money of course you don't because that would be stupid your trade deficit with Amazon is whatever it is that you paid for the product when you buy from the grocery store you now have a trade deficit of $100 if you spend $100 on your groceries because the grocery store didn't buy anything from you does that mean you should go to a more expensive grocery store and then if you boycott the grocery store you have somehow won no it means that you just chopped your own leg off because you're stupid okay that's what trade wars are this has been known since the days of Ricardo David Ricardo has been known for 300 years this is 16th century mercantilism he's talking about here and it's a giant fail when he says when we're down a hundred billion dollars with a certain country and they get cute don't trade anymore we win big ok there are many countries in the world that have trade surpluses overall trade surpluses let me name one of those countries that has a trade surplus for you Venezuela Venezuela has a trade surplus you know why because no one because they're there because no one in Venezuela has the ability to buy anything for it they put up enormous tariffs and so Venezuela has a trade surplus and people are eating dogs people are literally eating dogs in the street trade surplus trade deficit mean nothing because all a trade surplus or trade deficit recognizes is that you are paying another country for product you're voluntarily participating in exchange and then that money is not being paid back by that country to you but here's the magic of trade also when you pay a dollar for a Chinese product and it ends up in China what do you think happens to that dollar do you think they just take it and store it somewhere do you think that it magically turns into yen so now they've won so they can now turn around and use it in China no they have to use it in the United States because we have a different currency than they do so they turn around and they invest it back in the United States in our stock market in our bonds this is how the economic on imme works you have to be so economically ignorant to tweet something like this it is truly amazing but Trump didn't stop there here's some other stuff that he tweet we quote we must protect our country and our workers our steel industry is in bad shape if you don't have steel you don't have a country what now again this is very stupid we don't put our steel industry is not in bad shape our steel industry as I told you yesterday was up 5% in production last year and all of our steel companies have had stock increases over the last 10 to 15 years Nucor which is the top tool steel producer in the United States it's stock prices at $12 in 2000 it is now at $65 they're telling me that the steel industry is dying in the United States is doing just fine seventy two point five percent of all steel consumed in the United States is also produced in the United States our steel industry is not dying also somebody should inform Switzerland if they're not a country anymore because Switzerland does not produce its own steel in fact many countries don't produce their own steel they don't produce it on steel because sometimes they don't have the actual materials available to produce their own steel does this mean the country doesn't exist anymore I'm not aware that Israel produces lots of its own steel I don't think Israel has like great steel deposits or deposits and they import most of their steel is Israel not a country anymore and not a powerful country anymore of course not because that's stupid and then he says he explains further professor professor Trump he explains when a country taxes our products coming in and say 50% and we taxed the same products coming into our country at 0% not fair or smart we will soon be starting reciprocal taxes so we will charge the same thing as they charge us 800 billion dollar trade deficit have no choice again this is dumb let's say the China taxes our products 50% coming in right they tax every product that we send them 50% coming in which means presumably we're not selling as many products they're you know what else is happening Chinese citizens are paying at least 50% more for the same product there impoverishing their own citizens they're just making their own citizens pay more for a products they could have gotten more cheaply elsewhere so is the solution for the united states to jack up its own prices remember everyone in the united states is both a producer and a consumer in the steel industry there gonna be a lot of people who are very happy with the tariffs because now they don't have to compete with foreign sources but for every steel job there are 45 jobs in this country that use steel inputs whose prices just went up so Wilbur Ross the the Commerce Secretary whose most famous for falling asleep in cabinet meetings and drooling I'm serious okay real is not a joke okay that was reported by the New York Times apparently Trump got pissed at it because he would legitimately fall asleep in cabinet meetings top men okay and Wilbur Ross goes on television today and he says you know there's a ton of Steel and American cars and that means that if you raise the tariffs by 25% it's only raising the amount of the car by like half of 1% chump change number one not necessarily chump change to the guy who's paying for the car next 100 75 bucks on the $35,000 car is not necessarily chump change to everybody hey that's number one number two you're assuming that you can just make the calculation by the amount of steel in a car that's not correct there are lots of contractors between the or and between the car okay in every step of the way there is markup so if there is a steel product that is used in the making of an engine that is very often outsourced to another company that means the DAP company now has to pay more for the steel which means that they manufacture the product and they don't just pass the amount of the cost on they pass the amount plus the labor plus the profit right that means now they're charging more for that input and let's say it's a piece of an engine now somebody has to put that engine together and so they have to buy that product which is already marked up so they mark it up even more and this is how tariffs snowball when the President of the United States Barack Obama raised tariffs on Chinese tires we lost 12,000 jobs in the in the auto industry because Barack Obama raised the prices of tires okay and tires are a lot cheaper to manufacture and make and sell than cars are hey this is all stupid it doesn't make any sense it's economically illiterate and it's so funny there are all these people today or oh oh oh this is what from Brunt on they ran on this so obviously he's gonna do it yeah I didn't hear you saying the same thing about Barack Obama he ran a lot of garbage too and then he did a lot of that garbage we were all kind of pissed about it I recall yeah I was angry when Trump said this stuff during the campaign this is not me new to the game here hey I was reading full pieces in March 2016 about why Trump's trade policy was idiotic he and Bernie Sanders basically have the same trade policy note to everyone if you have the same policy on anything as Bernie Sanders you're stupid hey you should not have the same policy as Bernie Sanders on things Bernie Sanders policy is awful awful awful so in just a second I'm gonna explain to you all of the reasons why tariffs are bad we can go back to economic rudiments we're gonna go back to the very beginning and I'll speak in short words and phrases so that people can understand because it seems like there are a lot of people don't understand if it seems like I'm angry about this it's because I am this is legitimately econ 101 hey this is not complex it is not difficult it really is not hey just take it down to your normal everyday interaction with other people and you see how dumb this argument is the other reason I'm angry is if you want the president to have a successful term then you would like for the economy to be good there are a lot of people saying hey well don't worry about everything he says don't worry the 57% of the American public by polls think the president's a racist if the economy is good everything will be fine and the president says hold my beer I'm starting a trade war okay great it's great it alright well we'll explain all of this a little bit more in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so right now there's natural disasters going on all around the world in Puerto Rico they're still trying to recover from natural disasters imagine there's a natural disaster in your area and the government can't get to you and all the grocery store shelves have been emptied because the chain of supply has been disrupted by a stupid trade war and imagine that you now have to figure out how to live well the best way to do that is going to be with a is going to be by talking my friends over at my Patriot supply okay right now as I say in Puerto Rico there are people going with food with fort without food for weeks after disaster and then finally a FEMA truck will roll through through the neighborhood and drop off a care package and inside it's mostly junk food well you don't need to be the person who stuck like that this week get my Patriot supplies one-year emergency food supply for just 999 dollars okay you heard that right this is one year's worth of food for under a thousand bucks and normally you know you're talking about getting like enough for just a little while but again in Puerto Rico it is months past natural disaster month past natural disaster and people still don't have the food they need this kit normally sells for over two thousand dollars but this week for 999 dollars you get a one-year emergency food supply call eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen and ask for the Ben Shapiro one-year food kit special price nine hundred ninety nine dollars when you use my name you get that special price otherwise gonna be paying a couple grand for it or order online at prepare with Ben calm no more relying on a few minutes India an old bag of potato chips it's gonna last you for a day it's time your family was self-reliant 888 803 1413 888 803 1413 or prepare with Ben calm again that's prepare with Ben calm no reason for you to be reliant on the government under any circumstances and this is a one-time buy because this food last 25 years in storage so you do it once you never gonna have to worry about it again 888 803 1413 8 8 8 803 1413 or prepare with Ben calm again prepare with Ben calm let them know that we sent you ok so as I say the Presidents tariff policy is full-on ridiculous ok it is not good and here is why it's just number one tariffs are an unfair tax you are taxing one industry on behalf of another industry you are taxing people who buy cars on behalf of the steel industry and jobs will be lost in the car industry because you are attempting to save jobs in the steel industry as I said yesterday there are two hundred thousand jobs that were lost in the United States between 2001 and 2003 because of george w bush's far less stringent steel tariffs and Trump isn't just talking steel tariffs anymore he's talking about full scale trade war with everybody who has tariffs on our products which is just brilliant if all of these countries which wish to charge their own citizens more for products to protect their domestic industries then fine we should take advantage of that you get richer when you buy cheaper products if you don't have to pay as much for stuff you're getting richer and we're not all reliant on foreign tricky the United States a massive market economy we generate most of what we produce I mean we do most of what we produce we consume here in the United States I'm in most businesses so if everybody else decides that they are going to try to try to destroy our ability to import into their country to export into their country then why exactly would we cut off our nose to spite our face by making our own consumers pay more just to make any more sense as I say tariffs also destroy jobs when you remove money from profitable industries people who don't need tariffs and subsidies to survive and you give it to those who are inefficient it keeps jobs in industries that are less efficient and if companies is never loud then products quality actually declines over time so you're buying worst cars over time if you tear up foreign cars and then when you open up the market because people are tired of buying crappy American cars for example it's what happened in the 1970s then it's we're flooded with a bunch of Japanese cars and suddenly the American market share goes down dramatically this is exactly what happened in the 1960's and 1970's in the American auto industry tariffs actually create zombie industries okay America is not as I say damaged by unfair trade practices of other countries in the sense that they put a tariff on us and therefore we are greatly hurt currencies an exchange unit so all of the talk about how China also is is manipulating its currency okay if manipulating currency were that easy and that profitable if that were really the big issue in America then we would just print a bunch of money and we walk around with wheelbarrows like why Marge Herman II and the people in vitam our journey or in Venezuela today or in Zimbabwe where inflation was at one point at 1,000 percent a day those people were not immensely wealthy they were immensely poor inflation inflating your currency is a sign that you don't have a strong underlying fundamental economy trade is not a zero-sum game hey this is from Thomas solo in general international deficits and surpluses have had virtually no correlation with the performance of most nations economies Germany and France have had international trade surpluses while their unemployment rates were in double digits Japan's post-war rise to economic prominence on the world stage included years when it ran deficits and years when it ran surpluses the United States was the biggest debtor nation in the world during its rise to industrial supremacy became a creditor as a result of lending money to its European allies during the First World War and has been both the debtor and a creditor at various times since through it all the American standard of living has remained the highest in the world unaffected by whether it was a creditor or a debtor nation Thomas solo points out that if Japanese sold us a lot of cars when we send them lots of dollar they're gonna use those dollars to buy American assets Scott Lincecum who is a trade lawyer at Cato he says every dollar traveling overseas to buy imports in excess of our exports eventually comes back to the u.s. in the form of investment our trade deficit is matched by a capital account surplus in other words we buy goods and services from foreigners they buy an equal amount of our exports plus our financial assets aka foreign investment in the United States and here's the here's the key okay if trade we're really about just beating the other guy to prevent them from importing stuff why not just sync all the Chinese ships bringing products into the country does anyone that'd be good for the economy no because this is stupid s T wo PID stupid okay so in a second we're gonna move on from Trump steel tariffs apparently virtually every country in the world is now threatening countermeasures for steep new tariffs and remember how President Trump put on a bunch of tariffs on a Canadian lumber we now a shortage of Canadian we now a shortage of lumber in the United States that's been working out fantastically well for people in the United States okay we're gonna get to other things that are happening in the White House again it's been a rough 48 hours for the White House it's not a pylon it's just the truth we're gonna get to that in just one second okay so here is the here is the latest on the chaos inside the White House so right now here is where things stand Howe picks the president's top aide is stepping down Jared Kushner one of the people the president is closest to just lost his top-level security clearance Gary Cohn who has discussed his chief of staff replace John Kelly about a week and a half ago and is the head of Trump's economic program is now threatening to quit a national security adviser HR McMaster is apparently on the ropes as well so basically every top-level administrator except for John Kelly is on the ropes that is not the sign of a healthy administration even John Kelly doesn't sound super enthused about all of this here's the White House chief of staff yesterday talking about taking the job as White House White House chief of staff and moving on from Homeland Security truly at six months the last thing I wanted to do is walk away from one of the great honors of my life being the Secretary of Homeland Security but I did something wrong and God punished me I guess now there's an enthusiastic guy about his new job of keeping the president under control i punished him by moving on to the White House he talked about how he's happy to be helping the president push the agenda I'm sure he is but it is not an easy job the reason to turn over at the White House is so high is because everything is variable over there now let it be known this does not mean that everything that Trump is doing is bad okay the President of the United States by the time he has finished his first term will have replaced almost half of all of the judges on circuit courts across the country that's a wonderful thing he's doing a great job on that because he's delegated it out but when Trump is bored and he gets his hands on the gears of power when he when he grabs those levers and he starts playing video games all that comes out is bad stuff okay the president needs to be disciplined this is not because I want him to lose it's because I would like for him to be a good president and I would like for the country to win with him I like winning and the president supposedly likes winning - I'll tell you what is not winning what is not winning is putting forward gun proposals to seize weapons from a huge variety of citizens what is not winning is suggesting a massive trade war across the board as I said earlier the EU is now threatening massive retaliatory tariffs on the United States which is just wonderful a great way to tank the economy you know we've tried this before by the way and the smoot-hawley Tariff in 1930 are widely perceived to have led to the Great Depression and helped exacerbate it into a ten-year Great Depression as opposed to a relatively insignificant recession hey none of this makes any sense one of the reasons that Trump is doing all this stuff now is because when Trump is isolated when he feels like he doesn't have all the people around him he likes to have around him when hope Hicks is gone and Jordan Ivanka have been marginalized and it's just a bunch of people he doesn't know like John Kelly sitting around him he feels like he has to go back to his gut and has got uncertain issues is not bad and on other issues it is surely terrible and on trade it is surely terrible the New York Times is reporting on the situation in the White House apparently people in the White House did not even know that Trump was going to announce the steel tariffs and aluminum tariffs yesterday by the way the price of beer is going to go up - every beer can in America is used is made with aluminum which means that if you like your beer you're not gonna get to keep your beer the price on it is gonna go up which is I think most Americans are not going to be super happy with that the previous day according to the New York Times mr. Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn more than the chief of staff John Kelly he might resign if the president went ahead with the plan according to people briefed on the discussion Cohan had lobbied fiercely against the measures we'll see if he quits next week if Trump actually implements this stuff as I said the stock market today has taken a dump yesterday it also took a dump it's down about 200 points right now that is better than it was earlier this morning when it was down about 380 points so we will see usually it's around three o'clock in the afternoon they finally find out what exactly the markets gonna do today but as I say the five-day forecast on the market has been pretty garbage the high was 25 thousand seven hundred sixty-one today it is now a two thousand two 24,400 so that means that we've lost well over a thousand points in the last five days on the Dow Jones Industrial Average the reason we haven't lost more than that is because people don't know if Trump's actually going to do what he says it's going to do people are pricing uncertainty into the market well anyway White House aides arrived at work on Thursday they had no clear idea of what Trump would say about trade he'd summon steel in aluminum's to a meeting when the White House said only that he would listen to their concerns it seemed to signal that Cohn had held on but at the end of the photo session a reporter asked Trump about the measures and he confirmed that the US would announce next week it is imposing long-term tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum now how can you tell this is not the effect of trumps of massive expertise on trade even his guy on trade and in Peter Navarro is not good on trade Peter Navarro had recommended a 24 percent tariffs on steel he went to trunks at 24% tariffs on steel what did Trump do he said no 25 because it's in round number if we are going to be setting tariffs based on multiples of 5 let me suggest this is not an outgrowth of economic expertise it is rather an outgrowth of economic foolishness well obviously there's been tremendous turnover in the White House and the discomfort that Trump is feeling is obvious to everyone again when he says things like the WTO has been a disaster for this country and it's been great for China and terrible for the United States and great for other countries why is it the United States still has the most powerful economy in world history and why is it that we generate virtually all of the economic growth on planet earth why is that a so there's so there's that as well so all of this is just wonderful and another piece of bad news coming down for the White House I'm sorry to give all this bad news today another piece of bad news coming down for the White House that I will discuss in just one second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at zip recruiter so every business needs great people and a better way to find them we at the Daily wire are

slash daily wire it is the smartest way to hire you are gonna get the best employees through this service again zip recruit calm slash daily wire that also lets them know then we sent you okay so another piece of unfortunate is for the White House so president Trump has been on a tear against Andrew McCabe the ex deputy director of the FBI and the reason that he was been on a tear against Andrew McCabe is because his supposition is that McCabe and Co me and the rest of the FBI were out to get him during the last election cycle and in the post-election period well now it turns out that a Justice Department review is actually expected to criticize Andrew McCabe but at the former FBI deputy director under Comey it's expected to criticize McCabe why because he was too mean to Hillary Clinton so just so Trump's own Justice Department is about to find that Andrew McCabe the guy that Trump has been ripping on it wasn't that he was too hard on Trump is that he was too hard on Hillary Clinton hey they're gonna condemn him for authorizing the disclosure of information about a continuing investigation to journalists according to four people familiar with the inquiry such a damning report would give Trump at new ammunition to criticize McCabe who's at the center of Trump's theory the deep state actors inside the FBI have been working to sabotage his presidency but mr. McCabe's disclosures to the news media do not fit neatly into that assumption they contributed to a negative article about Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration's DOJ not mr. Trump the department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz has zeroed in on disclosures to the Wall Street Journal as part of a wide-ranging investigation into among other things how the FBI approached the 2016 inquiry into mrs. Clinton's handling of classified information mr. Horowitz said he expects to release a report this month or next so McCabe already said he was going to step down he stepped down as deputy director in late January so all of this is fodder for Trump that the FBI is corrupt but unfortunately the corruption doesn't seem to run toward Trump it seems to run toward they're a bunch of people in the FBI who are deeply discomforted with hillary clinton's corruption and we're releasing information to the press which cuts against Trump's argument okay that is not good for Trump right Trump's whole argument is the FBI is out to get him I've been skeptical of the story that the FBI was out to get Trump and I still think there are open questions about how the FISA warrants were used against Kyra Paige whether the FISA courts in general take bad information and turn them into warrants but I've been unconvinced by the evidence produced so far that the FBI was out to target trombe out to destroy Trump out to destroy his administration I think they're bad people inside the FBI like Peter struck and Lisa Paige those people should have been fired and Miller did fire them I think the FBI's current investigation into Trump Russia collusion is going to come up with nothing I think that what the FBI doing is doing right now is overblown but I don't think that during the transition period the evidence is there yet maybe it'll be shown maybe well I don't think the evidence is there yet that the FBI was quote-unquote out to get Trump as opposed to their overzealous on virtually everything and this is just another thing that they are overzealous on okay so in other bad news for Trump again it's been a bad Trump day and I hope that by the time we get to Monday he's turned it around and things are going great again but okay this is not a great indicator yesterday the President did a hearing an open forum on the opioid crisis and and it was very moving Eric Bolling did a video message about his son who died of an opioid addiction died an opioid overdose and Trump showed up and in the process he said that we should execute drug dealers in the United States and we have drug dealers that don't mean they kill hundreds and hundreds of people and most of them don't even go to jail you know if you shoot one person they gave you life they give you the death penalty these people can kill 2,000 3,000 people and nothing happens to him and we need strength with respect to the pushers and to the drug dealers and if we don't do that you're never gonna solve the problem if you want to be weak and you want to talk about just blue ribbon committees that's not the answer the answer is you have to have strength and you have to have toughness the drug dealers the drug pushers are they're really doing damage they're really doing damage some countries have a very very tough penalty the ultimate penalty okay when he when he says some countries have the very toughest penalty the ultimate penalty he's talking about the Philippines where they legitimately execute drug dealers so there are already laws on the books that if you're a drug kingpin and your drugs result in death that you can't actually get the death penalty in United States but if we're going to extend this to all drug dealers across the country that if you're dealing pot then we're not going to actually cute you I think this might be a little bit over the top so in the last 48 hours the presidents in the United States has suggested number one removing guns from people without due process if they are alleged to be mentally ill number two he has started in trade war and number three he has suggested that we execute drug dealers so it's been a very solid 48 hours for the for the White House now he walked back a lot of the gun stuff yesterday so the president did walk back some of the guns stuff yesterday he tweeted out last night that he had met with people over at the NRA the same NRA that he was ripping his corrupt just two days ago and even he I think Trump's feeling some heat from his right which is good you know one of my great fears before Trump was elected was the soul-sucking of the Republican Party the soul-sucking of the conservative movement that a lot of people were just gonna follow Trump wherever he goes because the president is the president and he has a lot of public sway and I do think that we've seen a couple of areas where the where the conservative commentariat is not willing to go even a lot of Trump supporters so Tucker Carlson is a good example of this so Tucker yesterday I had this to say about the president's talk his loose talk about guns at one point the president said the government should quote take the guns first go through due process second now I mean how honest do you want to be imagine if Barack Obama had said that just ignore due process and start confiscating guns well bomb would have been denounced as a dictator we would have denounced him first trust me Congress would be talking impeachment right now someone be muttering about secession well the media agreed with what the president said yesterday so they've under played it or they presents it as just a little battle between the president and the NRA okay so there's Tucker Carlson ripping into Trump pretty rare thing when you see Tucker ripping into Trump but again Trump's not had a good 48 hours good for Tucker and good for conservatives who are saying when things are wrong they're wrong whether it's Trump saying it or whether it's Obama is saying it okay so we'll continue with this and also a poll that shows that Democrats really do want to grab guns I don't just mean some Democrats I mean a majority of Democrats it's an amazing pool I'm gonna tell you about that in just second you're gonna have to go over to

over to iTunes SoundCloud YouTube please subscribe please leave a serve you it always helps we're the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so Democrats are jumping on board with with what Trump was suggesting and this is why I said yesterday I'm not super worried about what Trump had to say yesterday because right now Republicans are in charge of the Congress what happens if Democrats win control the Congress well I have a good hint for you as to what happens they listen to what Trump says they go they talk with Trump and then Trump says this sort of stuff and they draw up legislation specifically to the to his specs they draw it up for him and they pass it through the house and then it's up to Mitch McConnell to stand between you and doom and everybody who's ripping on Mitch McConnell is the weakling who had to be defeated by the trumpets then Mitch McConnell was the guy who had to be stood up too because he was too weak in caving to the left if the Democrats were in the house things are gonna get real nasty and Mitch McConnell could be the guy standing between conservatism and disaster and we will see how that goes ok but here is what the Washington Examiner reported this yesterday Senate Democrats said they will introduce a gun control bill that would expand background checks ban certain weapons and give the courts the power to temporarily take guns away from people who are deemed to be a threat to themselves and others after President Trump offered support for these goals in a White House discussion on Wednesday Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the only way to advance the measure in the GOP led Senate is with the endorsement and help from President Trump he described a scenario in which the Senate could pass Schumer's proposal with mostly Democratic support and a few Republicans encouraged by Trump and Schumer then reached out to Trump directly and said that the president should endorse the Schumer plan he said the president is the first step he said the McConnell would not bring up the bill without the president's persuasion so as I say Trump you have the NRA in the room everything was hunky-dory but House Democrats Senate Democrats they put together basically a gun ban bill and they're asking Trump to take the lead on it if they were to take control of the house in the Senate you can't rely on their good graces to maintain gun rights hey here is a poll they pulled from YouGov it asked people whether they favor or oppose banning semi-automatic weapons not semi-automatic rifles all semi-automatic weapons that means all semi-automatic pistols semi-automatic handguns semi-automatic rifles here are the poll numbers are you ready for this okay 55 percent of Americans say they support they favor strongly or favor somewhat banning all semi-automatic weapons in the United States okay that is the removal of 300 million guns from people in the United States okay and by party ID 82% of Democrats 82% of Democrats are in favor of removing all semi-automatic weapons from the citizens of the United States banning them okay that is the question the question was banning them okay now here's where it gets totally crazy okay then they followed up by asking people how they feel about banning all handguns which would include revolvers so now we're not talking just semi-automatic weapons we were talking all semi autos and all revolvers the difference in revolver and a semi-automatic weapon is that when you shoot a revolver then the cylinder moves and it read chambers by moving the cylinder and when you shoot a semi-automatic handgun one bullet pops up into the chamber automatically every time you fail every time you fire a bullet until the the magazine is empty okay here are the numbers on people who would ban all guns all of them okay you ready so favors strongly favor somewhat only 26% of Americans favor strongly or favor somewhat banning all of all guns banning all handguns hey among Democrats among Democrats ready for this forty let's see this is 44 percent of Democrats forty-four percent of Democrats say they favor it forty forty six percent of Democrats say they do not okay so that means that they are basically split 50/50 on repealing the Second Amendment by taking away all guns in the United States they're split 50-50 on whether to remove all guns in the United States in other words they are exactly what you thought they were hey Democrats are people who want to remove as many guns as possible in the United States and then they have the gall to tell people like us but they don't actually want to remove the Second Amendment from folks no they're all good-hearted no they don't want to take away your done they want to take away your gun it's obvious they want to take away your gun and this is why it matters when the president of the United States endorses their program and why it is imperative that Republicans keep the house and keep the Senate in next year's election cycle now there are a couple of obstacles to keeping the house the latest polls are one obstacle the second obstacle is if the economy doesn't particularly do well then that's going to hurt them and the third obstacle is a lot of the gerrymandering a lot of the redistricting that's happened over the past several years actually has not been particularly good as good for Republicans as they thought that it was going to be so G Elliott Morris who is a data journalist at The Economist he says the biggest problem Republicans face in the 2018 midterms is dummy man during GOP mapmakers have spread their voters too thin in districts that swing around the D + 10 mark causing higher seat loss and ten times the number of competitive seats as Democrats so in other words Republicans were trying to gerrymander so that there was you know 2 percent more Republicans than Democrats in a particular district but in off your election those people don't show up and so they actually created fewer hard red districts and hard blue districts then created a lot of purple districts in the hopes that they would win that means a lot of seats are vulnerable that means there are a lot of seats that are vulnerable so if you look at the AR plus district if you look at the the vote of the the Republican voters shared districts there are at last count between let's say the AR plus so first of all I'm just counting the numbers here 1 2 3 4 5 16 17 18 19 20 for one there are 22 seats there are 22 seats in which Democrats hold a majority of the vote and in which Republicans hold seats Republicans have 23 seat majority now okay so that means there one seat away from taking it here's the problem there are also another there are also another hundreds legitimately there know several dozen seats there are several dozen seats that are are plus ten or less there another dozen dozens of seats I mean I'm just looking at in the in the AR plus one category okay in the AR plus one category I mean in districts by the way that are dead even there another two districts there so that's 24 seats that are either dead even or democratic plus in a midterm election if you add in areas where it's slightly R plus there are another there another 10 seats that are R plus 3 or so within our plus 3 okay so that means if Democrats have a wave they could easily take 50 seats in this election cycle if there's a wave Democrats could easily take 50 seats in the house okay this is dangerous dangerous stuff and it is not good news so this is why it is imperative the president govern well it's why it's imperative the president be popular and why it's why it's imperative that the President of the United States not do stupid things and sink the instinct the the the trade policy of the United States okay meanwhile in in other news that that is worth discussing Twitter so Facebook has been just destroying everybody who is in the news business just destroying it there was a big company yesterday that went under because Facebook cut their revenues seventy five percent it's not just Facebook that's messing around with the algorithms in order to hurt news companies it is also Twitter that's about to do so so Jack who was the head of Twitter he he's tweeted out today that he wants to commit Twitter to help increase the collective health openness and civility of public conversation and hold ourselves publicly accountable toward progress that means shutting down more accounts presumably it means banning more language it means that Twitter is is sick of the blowback it's getting from the left and they're gonna start banning right-wing accounts and you can see that this is happening on a broader level there's a case that was brought before the Supreme Court about whether you could wear certain types of t-shirts into polling places and this case was pretty amazing the state of Minnesota was trying to ban people from wearing shirts that said the text of the second amendment to the polls they're saying oh that's that's electioneering okay so these so Justice Alito asked multi he went through a bunch of different he went through a bunch of different permutations of this could wear this shirt could wear that shirt so he said could you wear shirt that said I love abortion and the people in Minnesota the Minnesota lawyer said sure that's no problem so what could you wear a shirt that said I love guns and they said no you can't wear that shirt okay so in other words there are lawyers in all of these states who are now attempting to ban free speech from people on the right it's not a shock it is not a coincidence this is a severe movement on the part of the left in order to prevent anybody from having an open and honest conversation listen is there nastiness that happens on Twitter yes I was the number one recipient of it in 2016 is there nastiness that happens in public discourse I'm the guy who gets banned from campuses yes there is I try to be civil I like being simple I think it's worthwhile to be civil but I don't want an enforcement body sitting above anyone either on Twitter or Facebook or in the government saying that we are going to pass rules about civility and then ban people for it I would much rather have a raucous nasty exchange of opinions and have no exchange of opinions at all or an approved exchange of opinions by our masters and that's really gross okay so in just a second we're gonna do some things I like and some things I hate and then we'll get to be fabled mailbag so let's jump in with some things that I like so the new Star Wars movies have left me cold as you may have noticed so I thought that the force awakens was wildly overrated I also thought that the that the sequel the last Jedi was was over it was better than the force awakens I'm the only person who believes this apparently and I think that the last Jedi was significantly superior to the force awakens which I thought was derivative and destroyed my childhood by turning Han Solo into a loser single dad who gets murdered by his son so that that yuck okay but if you actually want to read Star Wars related stuff that's good okay Timothy Zahn is a very very good science fiction writer and I remember reading these when I was a kid and he wrote a three-part series that starts picks up right after the destruction of the second Death Star and it starts with the book heir to the Empire and it tells a whole different story than what's told in the force awakens and it's way better they should have just adapted these honestly they should have just gone back and adapted these because it's the books are much much better it's about the rise of a particular Admiral who's a brilliant Admiral it's sort of on the outskirts of the galaxy and how he manipulates things that the Empire actually has a comeback it's not just fast forward 40 years in the first order is back and we don't know how they got here why they're here the book is well-written it's clever and also the all of your favorite characters actually appear so we don't have to deal with all of the new characters that nobody cares about and is hoping die as soon as humanly possible right and it doesn't cannibalize the the characters that you love in order to preserve characters who don't give a damn about so check that out heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn okay other things that I like so good for condi rice condi came out and she said that we need gun rights because they're victimized people who still require guns she said guns help my father protect our family during segregation she said this on the view I was little girl growing up in Birmingham Alabama in the late fifties early sixties there was no way that Bull Connor and the Birmingham police were going to protect you and so when white knight writers would come through our neighborhood my father and his friends would take their guns and they'd go to the head of the neighbors a little cul-de-sac and they would fire in the air if anybody came through I don't think they actually ever hit anybody but they protected the neighborhood I'm sure if Bull Connor had known where those guns were he wouldn't have rounded them up and so I don't favor some things like gun registration okay good for condi this is exactly right I wish condi were were the spokesperson for the Republican Party not Trump on guns I mean she's doing a much better job there okay now time for a couple of things that I hate and then we'll get to the mailbag okay things I hate this entire week other than that things that at least done policy things that I hate so the Oscars are coming up on Sunday so we're all gonna sit around and pretend to watch a three-hour show full of obnoxious people who made movies no one saw this year no one saw any of these movies there were like two of these movies that anybody saw one was get out and the other was Dunkirk no one has ever seen any of these other movies okay the one that's going to win is so here's a here's I'm gonna do I'm gonna describe who I think are who I think gonna win but I'm gonna do it in terms that you're gonna understand because I'm gonna use projects that you've actually seen okay so here's who's gonna win everything okay first of all the movie that's going to win is grinding Nemo okay that's the shape of water about a woman who has sex with a fish basically it's it's overrated left to splash so check out gross so that's that's it's gonna win grinding Nemo okay the best director is the guy from Hellboy the better that's guillermo del toro the best actor is Commissioner Gordon the best actress is the lady from Fargo the best supporting actor is that weird guy from Iron Man 2 and the best supporting actress is the lady from Roseanne there now you know you haven't seen any of these movies but that's how you're gonna know who these people are you know there was a long period in in America where the we're at the Oscars every picture that one had had been a box-office top top 20 film that's because it used to be that the critics respected the American public enough that the American public actually liked to go watch something they gave it a little bit respect to the box office but it just shows you anything that the American people actually like to watch the critics are going to denigrate as crap for the masses unless of course it fulfills certain intersectional check boxes that means that we can already write in Black Panther for Best Picture next year I'm really looking forward to that in fact they should give it all the Oscars I think I think that first of all I actually do think the Michael B Jordan should probably be nominated for Best Supporting Actor for for kill monger because he's actually pretty great in the film them but I think we should just write it in for a suite because it's very important honestly the only big shock this year is that Wonder Woman didn't win everything cuz it was the greatest movie ever made according to the critics because women okay so time you know what I have to show you Alex Jones just because Alex Jones man so Alex Jones yesterday he fighting back against accusations of anti-semitism the way he fought back was not the strongest way in the world here's Alex Jones fresh off his supplements talking about why he's not anti-semitic and oh my god Wow my new wife's purr pedigrees German 3/4 German from Omaha and a quarter Irish and I'm proud of that background and the NE Semites call her a call her Jewish and everything else and I am she was I'd be proud of it but no she's got a noble nose but she's not Jewish so you know that's what all this comes down to ladies and gentlemen so I'm not admitting but my wife has a giant nose and people think she's a Jew yeah strong defense there Alex it's I got handed to me Power Move Power Move Alex Jones right there my wife's not a Jew but she has big nose some people think she's you but I'm not interested all right time for the mailbag let's just do it there are no more orders to be said Thomas writes hi mr. Shapiro my name is Thomas I'm a really big fan of the show I'm a freshman at the University of Southern Mississippi and I just got out of high school I firmly believe the reason for school shootings is social outcasting the issue is not about easy access to guns like the left believes but an issue of values within those students teenagers today are not being talked at value such as humility and the ability and self-discipline from their parents how should public schools go about teaching good values and prevent kids from becoming antisocial outcasts so I think it's very difficult for public schools to actually do that I think that there can be lessons in virtue I think personal responsibility starts at home kids who are who lacked that are gonna have trouble learning it at school I don't think schools can necessarily fill that gap but that but a school that that treats everybody as as a victim is not going to is not going to succeed either so I think schools used to generate a better feeling of community when communities were stronger themselves I again I'm not gonna put it on the schools to teach virtue to kids I just don't think that's how it works I think that the vast majority of children is how virtue by their parents this is a parental problem there's a reason a disproportionate number these school shooters don't have a biological father living in the home now Elizabeth says - love your show what is a good book to read about the history of the Second Amendment Thank You Liz so there are a couple of good books I believe Gordon wood talks about the history of the Second Amendment and some his books on the foundation of the Constitution there's I believe Paul Johnson may talk about a little bit in history of the American people there's also a bunch of actually his name escapes me right now it's right on the tip of my tongue there's a professor at Yale who's actually on the left who does an excellent analysis of sort of originalist doctrine on the Second Amendment and when I remember his name I will bring it up but it's a lot of common law stuff so there's some good common law books on it justice Bork has a couple of books in which he discusses the Second Amendment Dean says hi Ben my name is Dean I'm a seventeen year old junior in high school and I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment a member of the NRA at the moment myself and others in my school are being threatened by the leftist narrative the we are heartless coward for defending our rights my school will allow students to do a walkout I and others will not participate because it is obviously all about gun control Ben how should my friends and I exhibit our First Amendment during the walkout it's obvious that myself another conservative high schoolers are being threatened do you have any advice for us thanks for all you do god bless Shapiro's 2020 okay so here is my advice I think that you should walk out with all the other kids and I think you should bring a sign that says here to save lives I love the Second Amendment okay I think you should say I think that you should you should say both of those things I think that you should make it clear that you are there to help save lives and prevent school shootings and that these two things are connected the reason that you like the Second Amendment is so good people can stop bad people Kyle says hey Ben what do you think the next large-scale global catastrophe will be examples such as World War three u.s. Civil War global economic collapse global pandemic and so on well it's hard to predict a pandemic I would say that you know the chances of a pandemic have grown because of the resistance of two new antibiotics of some strains of disease so that's always a solid bet because pandemics do happen as far as global economic collapse I don't think that's gonna happen anytime in the near future unless we actually start if by global economic collapse we mean a severe economic recession or depression I think that you could see that but I don't think it's gonna last you know inevitably or interminably World War three I think the possibility exists but it's it's not super high I actually don't think that we are on the verge of a global catastrophe I think the greatest catastrophe that could happen right now is America falling more and more into the trap of european-style thinking because we have abandoned American founding principle and a slow slide I would say into global degrade degredation on the economic and moral scale I think that's probably the worst thing that could happen I don't think it's gonna be like a big flashpoint World War three everybody's too afraid to nukes at this point for that to really happen the Andersons recently I've been reading about dialectical materialism is flossing pretty evident it's wise Marxist thought so attracted to intellectuals well the reason it's so attractive to intellectuals is because intellectuals like to think that they are smarter than the common man and that the reason that the society has not worked is because they're not in charge commands and control economies are very attractive to people who think they are much smarter than everybody else capitalism free market economics lays a fair these assume that Joe Schmo Plummer knows better to do with his money then you know what to do with his money and intellectuals don't like that very much intellectuals like to think that they know better what to do with your money then you know what to do with your money they think that everybody is ruled by passion except for them they're the reasonable people at the top who can construct society in such a way so that everyone is happy and hence the the drive toward that hence the drive toward progressivism and bureaucracy and the notion of expertise ruling the roost the thing is that collective expertise is always better than individual expertise this is why command and control economies always fail because when you have somebody at the top who supposedly knows about trade that person knows way less about trade than the collective intelligence of the American people for example who trade with each other on a daily basis Spencer says what do you think it would take to revive the shared sense of purpose they characterize American society up until the late 20th century so I am writing a book on this right now I'm about halfway through that book I think it's going to require a renewed teaching of values that spring from judeo-christian culture as well as Greek reason so the Greek style enlightenment the the Lockean philosophy that they combined these two forces we're gonna have to relocate a sense of community based on a value system that is judeo-christian and origin and also based on a Greek teleology that suggests that you can discover morality by using logic and reason and the nature of the universe around you you can't just come up with moral systems in your head that have no relation to the nature of things in the nature of being but you can by investigating the nature of the universe see what they what the underlying cause of things is and therefore come up with with certain aspects of virtue in order to boil that down into practical practice you usually need some form of religion judeo-christian religion most prominent Matthew says dear Ben with YouTube being as large as it is today do you think there's an issue with the way they're handling their business should we just attempt to take our business elsewhere if we do not agree with their practice or is it possible that outlets like YouTube and Twitter need to potentially have regulations so this is a serious question I know the Prager you has been suing YouTube over exactly this issue so their private business I think they should do what they want but they are violating their own Terms of Service and they're lying about it this is my problem with Twitter YouTube and Facebook it's not that they're private businesses and they say listen we're gonna crack down on conservative websites you do that fine we all go form our own business the problem is they're lying they're saying we're free speech outlets we're not penalizing specific people we're not setting up our algorithms to penalize say Daily wire content while boosting TYT content and then that's exactly what they do they set up their algorithms that way when you lie now you're talking about defrauding people and there you may have a legal case so I think that's the bit like Facebook right now is screwing people so hard who spent a lot of money on algorithm on trying to figure out their algorithms building a Facebook following and then Facebook basically decided they wanted to downgrade certain kinds of content in order to upgrade kinds of content they find more genteel and amiable and that's I think defrauding clients I think it's just defraud in customers now Phil says hi Ben have you talked previously on homelessness how most people do not have a right to the streets and that they should seek community support my question is what do you think we should do specifically there's a large homeless population many of whom don't have a community to fall back on I agree that people should set themselves up in a community that's not the reality in many cases what should be done now to fix the problem well the answer is that if you're living on the street should be arrested okay really if you are living on the street you should be arrested and then you are one of a few types of people either you are mentally ill you're one of the mentally ill who's on the street in which case we should be looking at the commitment and we should be looking at mental health treatment for you and if it has to be involuntary because otherwise you're a schizophrenic and you're out wandering the streets is a danger to yourself then that's the way it's got to be if you're a drug user then drug use is still a crime in the United States oh or at least living on the street is so if you're living on the street we'll either arrest you or we will or you know if you're using it will try to detox you we'll do our best to help you put you in a community center but if you're back on the street again we'll arrest you again very little of this is economically driven isn't the point that I'm making here because we were just a matter of economics therefore there are a lot of homeless people then the answer would presumably be that there's not much you can do unless you generate more jobs but that's really not the biggest problem with homelessness okay let's see Zachary's has been a couple of weeks ago on your mailbag you said the Federal Reserve was into necessary components of the central bank well I agree that the Fed is mostly dead wait what are the consequences of allowing the inflation rate to rise or fall out of the constraints set by the Fed who would adjust interest rates thanks Zack well I'm in favor of going back to a gold system I know that this is considered heresy now or at least I'm in favor of pegging the price of the dollar to to the price of gold so the gold system suggested you can actually physically turn in your dollar for a certain amount of go but I don't know that you actually have to do that well you could do instead is simply pegged the price of the dollar to the price of gold which was the Bretton Woods system up until it was revoked in the 1970s so I don't see the reason we couldn't go back to something like that and it would be automatic Tyler's has been can you give your opinion on capital punishment and how to argue for it but still hold the belief that killing is sin so the answer is well on the biblical level there's the word that is used in the Bible is do not murder okay there's a different word in Hebrew for murder than for killing the word in Hebrew is low tare Tov right low means no fair Tov means you shouldn't murder okay so there you should not murder is that is that rule okay it is not lo taha rogue taharoa would be don't kill so on a biblical level nowhere in the bible does it says say that you shouldn't have death penalty in fact the death penalty is prescribed for a wide variety of crimes in the bible itself okay on just a secular moral level there are certain crimes that are so egregious that if you were to keep people in jail for them you would be doing a disservice to the society at large so I'm not even talking about it on a deterrent level there are two types of things are trying to deter one is you're trying to deter people from committing the crimes they know that the death penalty and the second thing is you're trying to deter tribal vengeance and one of the reasons that the government has a monopoly on the legal use of force except in self-defense is because what we don't want is tribal warfare tribal warfare usually happens when you have one tribe and they kill somebody from the other tribe and then the second tribe says you know in revenge we're gonna go kill somebody from the first tribe and then the first tribe says oh my god you killed that guy let's go kill that guy from the second tribe this is how Wars start is how intertribal conflicts start it's why gang violence which is basically just tribal conflicts in the inner cities is so is so awful that's why you actually need a system where people feel like the problem is being taken care of by a third power and that problem does involve the execution of people who kill other people Jessie says hi been huge fan we were having election for our City Council and mayor this year in campaign finance reform is a huge topic as I'm doing the research for myself I'm curious as to what your opinion is on campaign finance regulation on a federal state and local level I do not think that the government ought to ought to be involved in campaign finance regulation on any level I think they should be involved in bribery and if you are bribing somebody to vote a certain way that is a crime but if I decide to spend my money and my friends and I decide to spend my money on an election I don't see the problem with that and I think it's an aspect of free speech yeah it's my money I should be able to do with it what I want I should be able to say what I want I should be able to buy the free speech that I'm capable of having it isn't under the government's business because once the government butts in it's pretty rare that it's not going to have some sort of impact that it's politically motivated campaign finance reform is being pushed by Democrats not because Democrats actually care about corruption in the in the election system because they're perfectly happy with watching unions spend millions of dollars billions of dollars actually on politicians they like it's because they think they're gonna be ruling out the rich fat cats on Wall Street but while allowing the unions to do what they want House has been Jordan Peterson argues IQ of the poppy 15 percent of the population has an IQ so low they can't function in a normal job how would you as a libertarian support these people so I'm sure this is true I mean there are percentages of the population that can't have a normal job I know it's 15 percent but there's certainly a certain percent and the answer is that community is supposed to pick up the slack and that you're supposed to actually have local viable communities which is why you do need religious communities it's why you need to have local communities where people get together know each other and like each other and it becomes a common commitment to help people who can't take care of themselves otherwise it's gonna get thrown on government kate says hey Ben if you were a cheese which cheese would you be I don't know that's it that's not a good question I don't know the answer to that because I don't know cheese as well enough to have a solid answer to that the off the top of my head mozzarella may be mild but completes every dish that's not right now boo-ki sorry getting booed in the studio by my own people yeah I don't know I pass would you say sharp cheddar okay maybe that's fair hey Ben I want to tell you that I love your show and no BS approach to politics and the many topics that come with it I questioned you today is what brought you to be up a die-hard White Sox fan I'm a die-hard Cubs fan have been born and raised in Chicago Northwest Indiana area the rivalry between the two teams is great so why the Sox because my dad is a Sox fan you grew up a Sox fan we wrote an entire book called say it so about the 2005 White Sox championship season you can get that over at Amazon the so we are huge Sox fans because and I will pass it down to my son because suffering is just in our nature I need to pass down to my son rooting for a team that nobody else roots for and that has only won one World Series in the past hundred years let's see one more question Chelsea says hey Ben what is it that makes children thrive more academically socially and emotionally with married parents than with cohabiting parents who do not separate what it is exactly that makes marriage so beneficial Thanks well number one Co happening parents who do not separate there's still the possibility there do a separate there's a burden to overcome when people get married what you're really doing is you are setting up an obstacle to you getting out right you're locking the door behind you when you're just cohabiting there's always the feeling that one person has at least one foot on the threshold because there's no loss of income there's no community property there's no there's no notion that you actually lose anything by walking out the door so every day is a real value a ssin as to whether this ought to happen once you've pre committed it's it's sort of like a game of chicken when you put a brick on the accelerator and you show everybody the done so once you've done that you've pre committed to everybody else that you are not walking out that door and children need to feel that sense of community I think it's very important the children feel secure and their upbringing secure that mommy and daddy are still going to be there to help them and cohabitation by the way is a really bad indicator cohabitation before marriage it is inversely proportional to lasting marriages after marriage so if you go happen for a long time then you get married the chances that you stay married as a statistic are much lower than if you were just to get married without KY happening first okay so we'll be back here next week we can all hope and pray the policy gets better in the meantime because
