the New York Times has recently reported that there was an individual working on Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign who was accused of sexual harassment by another female employee who was thirty years old at the time and when Hillary Clinton was advised to fire this individual she refused to do so so the man in question is burns Strider and this all occurred was like a faith-based initiative yes advisory yes so I'll give you details on what he did and that will enrage you even more because his role was in my opinion incredibly unnecessary but miss Clinton's campaign according to the New York Times Miss Clinton's campaign manager at the time recommended that she fired the adviser but miss Clinton did not instead mr. strider was docked several weeks of pay and order to undergo counseling and a young woman was actually moved to a new job so as far as his role he was her faith adviser and sent the candidate scripture readings every morning for months during the campaign I mean maybe Hillary Clinton's faith is very important to her but I would argue that if someone in your campaign has been accused of sexual harassment by another employee in your campaign he should probably Rican you should reconsider whether or not that person should be there like maybe fire that person but she refused to do it he was hired five years later at an independent group that supported Clinton's 2016 candidacy correct the record which was created by a close Clinton ally David Brock but he was later fired because of similar issues okay so a couple things here so he's working on the 2008 campaign and that's why five years later he gets hired by correct the record on the neck on them to work on the next campaign so this doesn't seem to be in any kind of dispute they've got four sources including it appears very high officials in the campaign saying well we wanted the guy fired we try to get Hillary to and they're all women whether its sole store was the campaign manager or Jess O'Connell who was a national director of operations and who originally field of the complaint and concluded that Strider should be fired so to Anna's point look let's say you're really religious and by the way not to be fair I had been pretty cynical about Hillary Clinton's religiosity but maybe she is maybe she's you know just gonna say bible-thumper I don't know look I'm not a religious person I have a bias against it I don't think it's necessary and I don't want it informing our leaders because I don't want them thinking that they're talking to God so but even if you are let's issue okay you love it she's a devout Christian okay well we didn't know that you can't pick up a Bible and read a verse nobody you can't find some other pastor in the country I feel like if if that person sole role in your campaign is to be your faith advisor and there are credible sexual harassment allegations against him doesn't that now make him or his faith advisement null and void like well I wouldn't want to be advised faith advised by someone who's been sexually harassing a 30 year old on my campaign he was also married have you yeah and look I look if he's married and it turns out that he had an affair with someone on the campaign like that's not there's consent there and I don't care it's none of my business but that's not what happened in this situation so let me give you the details of allegations against him the complaint against a Strider was made by a 30 year old woman who shared an office with him she told a campaign official that he had rubbed her shoulders and appropriately kissed her on the forehead and then he had been sending her a string of suggestive emails and so through this investigation she shared those emails to prove it which is why Hillary Clinton was advised and urged to fire him and she refused to do it I just don't understand and then you know the 2016 campaign has the audacity to start judging women for not voting for Hillary Clinton if they're supportive of Bernie like so that kind of stuff I mean it's just a special place in hell for women who don't fire sexual harassers you know people who suck Madeleine Albright said oh it's like no I don't know I you know this was a different time they did punish him you know he had he got docked pay he had to take you know sensitivity courses or undergo counseling and they didn't demote her they moved her to another job so I mean I think if it happened today he'd get fired there's obviously cultural changes and I think it's interesting that just to be fair to them or not fair but there's a weird tension at the heart of the whole Clinton operation between like this you know powerful couple and you're forwarding a woman who regardless of men it's no secret what I think of her politics but she's obviously very formidable and wanted to take a shot at the top and was a big part of Bill Clinton success and then on the other hand there was running a lot of interference that like even in the most benign scenario you know there was weird stuff going on with Bill Clinton there's all sorts of weird gender dynamics and I think that this speaks to that and I mean you know look if this was in a campaign I would run with it and try to crucify on it because I want to win now it's like you know it's sad and it's embarrassing and it's fine to bring up her hypocrisy but like c'est la vie Hillary Clinton just don't write another stupid book I just I just don't want to hear her talk about how she's this victim of sexism and all these terrible men who have done all these terrible things to her and said all these terrible things to her you know and and her campaign slogan was I'm with her I'm with her well were you with her when it came to a 30 year old woman who worked on your 2008 banana it's literally with her this feels like a stretch to me not that again with that story shouldn't be covered but I mean they did believe her it's just that they didn't deep the firing action they punished him in a different way and didn't fire they didn't know so let me let me see that's not to work let's take Hillary out of it let's take Hillary out of it because for me know I have to jump in with this cuz I I think that there's a blind spot because of gender issues here and look if I'm working at TYT all right let's put it in our context I'm working at TYT there's a male employee here who is sin these emails making me uncomfortable harassing me I go to my superiors they urge Jencks to fire him and Jake says I'm not gonna fire him I'm just gonna have him work in a different position but within the same company I still have to deal with that person nice addition that's actually even worse it's actually good that's actually a part of a much bigger problem with personally no either way they're working on the same campaign still and it's it well the campaign is huge I'm with you I agree your scenario is but it's not it's actually it's just not quite what happened here that that she asked not to have any more action interaction with him and she didn't and it's a huge campaign there's a zillion places to put people they didn't they should have fired it but in 2008 they didn't do that there's a lot of places to spread rumors about Barack Obama that's right that's right but but okay so let me look again as with almost everyone here I don't have any love for Hillary Clinton and and and I wish they hadn't chosen her as a as a candidate I can go on forever having said that let's also acknowledge that Hillary Clinton is in a tough spot there at a unique spot in that she has the Bill Clinton baggage and so with the Bill Clinton baggage if she starts firing people who have done this right and and then people turn around and go what about your husband and what he did with Monica Lewinsky and what it was a subordinate that worked under Bill Clinton etc now does that justify keeping on social rosters no but I'm giving you and other thing I want to be clear about is that Hillary Clinton cannot fight back here she she can't go public and say oh yeah but here was a things you didn't know because that'll get her in a world of trouble and I'm mess on top of a mess she hadn't fired and done him so I always assumed that I read the story the first time I just assumed that it was somebody she cared about like yeah she's a friend like it was a friend and she didn't want to throw a friend we might not be without matters to her because it would never be a because it would never be a news story that like it wasn't this kind of thing wouldn't have gotten covered they didn't have to bury it it's just no one was gonna go public with it's a different Europe but and your example was true and it does suggest that there's a significant different interpretation if somebody was sending you those things and you had in any way had to work with them I mean the guys should be fired no matter what but but if the circumstances were lesser and us he would have to be fired and and Jake just to respond to what you said you know yeah she's in a tough position but it also cuts both ways meaning that after bill that whole bill clinton thing happened what did Hillary do what was her response it was to put down the women who made the accusations against him and so she didn't support the women in it I mean she didn't have to say anything but she did say something and it was to put those women down and then you have this example from 2008 it doesn't look good it doesn't look good so yeah she's in a tough spot but you know I think the principle thing to do would be to protect the people who are working on your campaign by firing an individual who's doing something that is inappropriate yeah and by the way just one more thing that's important these are not just allegations in there and not just from one person this seems heavily backed up including dry the top advisor she had at the time so given that context no matter what kind of a bad spot you thought she was in and in all the context we've given it at a minimum it appears to be enormous Lee and it goes if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart
