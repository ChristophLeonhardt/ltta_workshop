1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
the most common threat I think for

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,319
anyone watching this video is that they

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,180
might give up their personal information

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">online without realizing it and that can</font>

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,490
happen in a number of ways the biggest

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,380
one is through something called fishing

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,800
which is when someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> tries to dupe you</font>

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,960
into giving up your<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal information</font>

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">say for example by sending you an email</font>

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,880
that looks like it's from<font color="#E5E5E5"> google but</font>

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,060
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goggle asking you to</font>

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,310
reset your password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you just click</font>

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,619
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> button the page looks like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a your</font>

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,690
gmail login page and you type in your

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,450
password your password but in fact that

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,040
was a page that was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> by somebody</font>

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,120
who's trying to steal<font color="#CCCCCC"> your information</font>

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,100
there are ways to protect yourselves

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,590
against this type of threat and the main

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,329
one is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called two-step</font>

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,149
verification every time somebody uses

22
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,850
your password on a new device they need

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,640
to get a confirmation code that only you

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,489
have on your phone and said look up two

25
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,739
step verification and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google has one</font>

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,829
Twitter and Facebook also have them and

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:00:00,000
keep yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe from being finished</font>
