HUMAN RIGHTS.
I THINK THE COURT CANNOT GIVE AN
INDEPENDENT RULING AS LONG AS
THESE KIND OF STATEMENTS
CONTINUE.
>> Shannon: EXECUTIVE SR.
COUNSEL AT THE AMERICAN CENTER
FOR LAW AND JUSTICE JOINS US TO
TALK ABOUT THIS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, I KNOW
YOU HAVE BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED
IN THIS CASE, AND THE MORE I
READ ABOUT IT, THE MORE
FRUSTRATING IT IS ABOUT
WITNESSES, "EVIDENCE" BEING
INTRODUCED.
THE LAST THING I READ IS THAT
THE DEFENSE MAY NOT BE ALLOWED
TO PUT ON WITNESSES OF ITS OWN.
WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE?
>> IT IS TOTALLY A SHAM TRIAL.
PASTOR BRONSON IS NOT RECEIVING
ANY JUSTICE AT ALL.
THE SECOND DAY OF TRIAL WAS
MONDAY.
AT THE END OF 11 HOURS,
MR. HOLABIRD, WHO YOU JUST
TOWARDS BECOMING A TURKISH
ATTORNEY, TURNED IN A LIST
OF WITNESSES, AND THE COURT
INFORMED HIM OF ANY OF THE
WITNESSES OR SUSPECTS, THEY
WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO
TESTIFY.
OF COURSE, THAT IS ALL OF PASTOR
PASTOR -- THEY ARE ALL SUSPECTS.
THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO
REFUTE THIS.
>> Shannon: THEY SAY THIS IS
STRICTLY A LEGAL ISSUE, HE HAS
BEEN ANY NUMBER OF THINGS,
TERRORIST, INVOLVED IN A COUP
ATTEMPT, TRYING TO SET UP A
SEPARATE KURDISH STATE, SAYING
THINGS ABOUT ISLAM, IT IS ALL
OVER THE PLACE.
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IN TURKEY HAS
SAID "GIVE A PASTOR, TAKE A
PASTOR."
THAT APPEARS TO BE A REFERENCE
TO THE CLERIC WHO IS NOW HERE IN
THE U.S.
THEY ACCUSE THE CLERIC OF ALSO
BEING INVOLVED WITH AN ATTEMPTED
COUP WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF
YEARS.
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE IS BEING USED
FOR POLITICS AT THIS POINT.
IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO READ
THIS CASE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
FROM THE BEGINNING, ON
OCTOBER 7TH, 2016, WOULDN'T
PASTOR BRUNSON WAS ARRESTED, WE
KNEW THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY
SOME POLITICAL PLAN ON THIS, AND
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN HAS NOW TWICE
PUBLICLY DEMANDED A SWAP OF THE
TWO, THE CLERIC IN PENNSYLVANIA,
FOR PASTOR BRUNSON.
PASTOR BRUNSON HAS BEEN USED AS
A BARGAINING CHIP AND A
POLITICAL PAWN.
HE'S INNOCENT UNITED STATES
AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO IS BEING
HELD HOSTAGE IN TURKEY IN
TURKEY.
>> Shannon: NOT LONG AGO, WE
HAD TWO CENTERS ON THE SHOW WORK
ON THIS CASE.
DEMOCRAT JEANNE SHAHEEN AND
REPUBLICAN JAMES LANKFORD, WHO
ARE BOTH WORKING ON THIS.
TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A
SANCTIONS PACKAGE.
THIS IS WHAT SENATOR SHAHEEN HAD
TO SAY WHEN SHE WAS WITH US.
>> PASTOR BRUNSON IS BEING HELD
HOSTAGE.
I THINK IT GOES ALL THE WAY TO
THE TOP, TO ERDOGAN,
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN.
HE'S THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.
THESE ARE TOTALLY MADE UP
CHARGES.
THEY DON'T EVEN CONNECT PASTOR
BRUNSON WITH HIS CHURCH, THEY
CALLED HIM A MORMON, DON'T SEEM
TO KNOW WHO HE REPRESENTS.
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN
TURKEY FOR 23 YEARS.
AT HIS TRIAL WHEN HE WAS ASKED
ABOUT THE CHARGES, HE SAID, I
LOVE TURKEY, I WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING AGAINST TURKISH PEOPLE.
THIS IS NOT FAIR.
>> Shannon: WE HAVE HAD AN
ABBASID OR THEY ARE ON THE
GROUND, OTHER LAWMAKERS, THE
PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT NOW
WEIGHING IN ON THIS.
TURKEY IS A NATO ALLY.
HOW DO WE GET THIS GUY HOME?
>> WE HAVE TO UP THE PRESSURE.
WE HAVE SEEN THAT WE HELD THE
LINE WITH BOTH KOREA AND
AMAZINGLY, NORTH KOREA HAS
RETURNED THREE PRISONERS.
WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME, EVEN
THOUGH TURKEY IS A NATO ALLY,
THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING TO
SPECIFIC DEMANDS FROM THE
PRESIDENT HIMSELF.
I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SANCTIONS,
WE HAVE TO HOLD THE LINE AND WE
HAVE TO LET TURKEY KNOW THAT IF
THEY ARE GOING TO ACT LIKE AN
ENEMY BY CONTINUING TO HOLD
PASTOR BRUNSON, WE HAVE TO
TERRORIST READING THAT MIKE ONE.
>> Shannon: I KNOW THIS CAME
AS A BLOW TO HIS FAMILY,
FRIENDS, LOVED ONES, FINDING OUT
THEY WERE SHUTTING THE STONE
AGAIN.
HE'S BEEN HELD FOR A LONG TIME.
IN THE MEANTIME, THE PRESIDENT
HAS HAD GOOD SUCCESS, THE
PRESIDENT GETTING PEOPLE FROM
DANGEROUS AREAS WHERE THEY WERE
BEING HELD AGAINST HIS WILL.
HE IS CONTINUING TO INTERVENE,
AS YOU ARE.
CECE HEIL, PLEASE KEEP US
