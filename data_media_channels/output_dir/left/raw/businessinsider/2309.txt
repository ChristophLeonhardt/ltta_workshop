1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
which was thanks for being with us what

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,799
is fan pulse so fan pulse is basically

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,210
the best way to follow sports with your

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,529
friends it's kind of like you said it's

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:08,760
being at the sports bar with all your

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,679
buddies all the time so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that</font>

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,120
you check into a game you tell everyone

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,500
you're watching this game<font color="#E5E5E5"> and instantly</font>

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,820
you're able to cheer<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your friends</font>

10
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,170
trash out with your friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

11
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,330
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same game now how are you</font>

12
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with say Facebook or Twitter so</font>

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,920
today we're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate with</font>

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,359
those guys so what we do is you can find

15
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">your friends from Facebook and Twitter</font>

16
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,960
and bring them into fan pulse just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

17
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,220
you can also do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same thing with</font>

18
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,500
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone address book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then once</font>

19
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,488
you do that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> check in the games</font>

20
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:33,540
of your shell we can actually publish

21
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,340
your status back out to Facebook and to

22
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,630
Twitter so all your friends know in

23
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,469
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the friends that you're</font>

24
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,020
chatting with on fan pulse now do your

25
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,030
user demographic do they use one more

26
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,640
than the other um you know our early

27
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,870
theories say that there's a lot of

28
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,989
facebook usage within our early users

29
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,280
twitter is great but it tends to be this

30
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think a lot of people that like to</font>

31
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,460
comment into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud whereas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook</font>

32
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,690
will update their status to tell their

33
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,250
friends what's going on right so we're

34
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,690
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know bigger overlap with</font>

35
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook although we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still</font>

36
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of usage with Twitter know how our</font>

37
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,300
sports<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan is engaging with each other</font>

38
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,099
around sports you know when we started

39
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">this business we actually felt like</font>

40
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,680
there's a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cry for help from</font>

41
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
sports fans and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in talking to their</font>

42
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,260
friends when they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same</font>

43
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,930
place he would send five SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages to</font>

44
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,670
each other from a bar and get five back

45
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,200
not realizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's always going to</font>

46
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,640
happen there's no reply all on<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

47
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,009
messages wait people send emails with

48
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:20,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hope that their friends are also</font>

49
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,250
watching the game but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they often</font>

50
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,479
don't get responses so something to be

51
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,799
both watching the game and checking

52
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,780
their email at the same time so we

53
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,950
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that imposes a way to solve</font>

54
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,509
that by broadcasting what you're doing

55
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,860
around sports you got your friends

56
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,970
engage with you when it's appropriate

57
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,350
for them to engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you so you can</font>

58
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,640
chat you can catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on what's been</font>

59
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,229
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the game do all those things</font>

60
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,409
on fan pulse so now our people in the US

61
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,140
talking with fans in say England for the

62
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,479
premier Premier League or how is it

63
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,549
working is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it becoming like that global</font>

64
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,560
of a platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely has that</font>

65
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
capability today actually though we're

huge for you guys absolutely and where

83
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,790
we excel is really in connecting friends

letting them talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the sports so</font>

85
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,460
with the Olympics right now we don't

86
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,020
have any data all we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is letting</font>

87
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,280
people check<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the Olympics and talk</font>

88

to their friends that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also watching</font>

interaction between East Coast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> West</font>

91

your bracket other than checking your

105
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,530
score but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's tons a conversation</font>

106

that happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're going to let</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people check into games and cheer for</font>

premier league now we don't we haven't

124
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,930
turn on qualifier support yet but we

125
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,880
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing that shortly but</font>

126
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely for the world cup left full</font>

127
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,850
stats real-time data and let people

128
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,560
check in so it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty cool if you</font>

129
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,709
can you know check in and follow it with

130
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:36,940
all your friends that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cheering for</font>

131
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,050
the US but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if you have friends</font>

132
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,970
abroad<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can talk to them we are we</font>

133
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,290
can increase some cool features to see

134
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,820
who's pulling for what countries at what

135
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,860
time so we plan to do a lot around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

136
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,910
world cup so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a app at the App</font>

137
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Store give me a little bit of background</font>

138
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,170
on the submission and approval process

139
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,610
that you have to go through for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font>

140
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,320
sure so this was our<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

141
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,600
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the process i would say on</font>

142
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,010
the whole we were pleasantly surprised

143
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,510
it was very very quick in getting you

144
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,620
know from submission to being

145
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,170
interviewed to give him feedback the

146
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,310
challenges that we had were really that

147
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was no visibility into that what</font>

148
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,459
we learned after the fact a little bit

149
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:13,660
later the processes they do a legal

150
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">review of marketing review a technical</font>

151
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,798
review of content review and that

152
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,358
feedback comes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> parts so it'd be</font>

153
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,709
really one more helpful for us to get

154
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,750
all that feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> in three days</font>

155
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,610
part 1 of feedback in one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

156
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,900
part two a feedback after we submit

157
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,820
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix those errors or issues</font>

158
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,430
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Apple has so it was a it was</font>

159
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,380
good in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got approved where</font>

160
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're lodge we had an update that was</font>

161
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,430
submitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sent through with two days</font>

162
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,830
so that's been great but a little more

163
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,450
visibility would always be helpful now

164
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,950
do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they treat bigger guys like</font>

165
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,750
a skype or facebook different than say

166
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,820
smaller developers um you know what's

167
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,380
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

168
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,760
people called bread advocates<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

169
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think those tend to be more</font>

170
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,560
for brands like the gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and target that</font>

171
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,570
have big ad campaigns targeted with

172
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,060
their apps and they tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get longer</font>

173
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,970
lead times anyways I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,169

desktop website we should also have a

199
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,130
mobile component to it so we optimized

200
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,900
