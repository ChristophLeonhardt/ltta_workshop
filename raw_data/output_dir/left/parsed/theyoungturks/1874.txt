SOME
EXCITING NEWS.
AS SOME OF YOU
MAY KNOW, JOHN IADAROLA SPENT A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN
THE ANTARCTIC TO FILM SOMETHING
CALLED TRUE NORTH, AND I AM
HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IF YOU
ARE INTERESTED IN WATCHING IT,
AND I HEAVILY RECOMMEND THAT YOU
DO, YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT ON
GO90.
YOU GO TO GO90.COM AND
SEARCH FOR TRUE NORTH.
THERE
YOU GO, AND YOU CAN GET A LITTLE
SENSE OF WHAT THIS SHOW IS ALL
ABOUT IN THE TRAILER THAT WE
ARE ABOUT TO SHOW YOU, BUT IT
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH CLIMATE
CHANGE.
IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH
THE CULTURE THERE, THE
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES TRYING TO
SURVIVE THERE.
IT IS JUST SUCH
AN INCREDIBLE SERIES AND I'M SO
PROUD OF JOHN AND OUR TEAM
FOR BEING PART OF IT.
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT WHAT THE SHOW IS
ALL ABOUT.
THE YOUNG TURKS.
WE'RE GOING TO BE COUNTER
ESTABLISHMENT.
WE'RE GOING TO
TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH.
WE'RE
GOING TO ROCK THE BOAT.
WE'RE
SENDING TWO OF OUR REPORTERS,
JOHN AND CHAVALA TO THE NORTH
POLE.
WE'RE EN ROUTE TO AN
ABANDONED GHOST TOWN.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING
HOW TO DOGSLED.
ISN'T THIS AMAZING?
I'M GOING TO BE HIKING ON
GLACIERS.
THAT JUMPS OFF THERE.
I'M GOING TO BE GOING ON
BOATS.
30 DAYS OUT ON THE OPEN
OCEAN, CONDUCTING SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH.
THE GLACIER IS RETREATING FASTER
THAN THE MAP IS UPDATING.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SINGLE THIS
NEW WILDLIFE EXPOSED TO NATIVE
CULTURES, WE'RE GOING BE HIKING,
CAMPING, SEEING THE AURORA
BOREALIS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING OUR
CAMPS.
I'M THEORIZING THAT WE
ARE NOT GOING TO DIE IMMINENTLY.
THIS IS HUMANITY AT ITS MOST
TENACIOUS.
OKAY, SO OBVIOUSLY THEY WENT TO
THE ARCTIC WHICH IS WHY THE
SERIES IS TITLED TRUE NORTH, AND
BY THE WAY, CHAVALA
HAS DONE WORK WITH US AS WELL,
AND SHE IS AN INSPIRATION.
TALK
ABOUT TRUE JOURNALIST, PUTS
HERSELF IN WAR-TORN PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY JUST TO DO REAL
JOURNALISM AND GATHER THE NEWS,
SO IT IS REALLY AN HONOR TO SEE
WHAT I AM SEEING THERE.
I LOVE IT.
I CAN WAIT TO WATCH IT.
IT OF COURSE STARTS TODAY, APRIL
19.
ALL 17 EPISODES ARE ON THE GO90
APP AND I AM GOING TO BINGE
WATCH.
ME TOO, I CANNOT WAIT.
JOHN GOT US ALL EXCITED
BECAUSE HE KEPT SENDING THESE
VIDEOS AND
THAT WE SHOW YOU GUYS
THROUGHOUT AND VISITED DIFFERENT
ADVENTURES LIKE THAT GHOST TOWN
WAS CRAZY AND SUPER CREEPY.
AND
THEN HE GOT TO HANG OUT WITH ALL
THE SCIENTISTS AND THEN HE
RECENTLY DID A PANEL IN NEW YORK
WITH BILL NYE.
HE IS LOVING
THIS, EVERYBODY GO CHECK IT OUT.
