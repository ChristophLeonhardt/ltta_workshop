STOLEN BY OR TRADED TO
TERRORISTS WITH TIES TO AL
QAEDA.
YIKES.
BRIAN, OVER TO YOU PLAIN
BRIAN LAST WEEK GALA THEME
WAS HEAVENLY BODY.
I WASN'T INVITED EITHER.
JIMMY KIMMEL DECIDED TO MAKE
ONE REAL NUNN THE BUTT OF
HIS JOKE.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT
CATHOLIC IMAGINATION THESE
OUTFITS CAME FROM BUT THE
CATHOLIC FASHIONS FROM WHEN
I GREW UP WERE A LITTLE BIT
THIS IS SISTER MARY FRANCIS
O'BRIEN.
>> WEARING THE LATEST FROM
J.P. PENNY.
>> CROWD ROARED THE NUNN IN
THAT PICTURE IS A REAL
PERSON DEDICATED ENTIRE LIFE
TO GOD AND TO KIDS U NEXT
GUEST WROTE AN OP-ED ABOUT
HER ENTITLED MEET JIMMY
KIMMEL'S NUNN.
HE WRITES IT WAS ONCE
UNDERSTOOD THAT A GENTLEMAN
NEVER HOLDS UP A WOMAN'S
LOOKS TO RIDICULE.
TURNS OUT THERE IS AN
EXCEPTION FOR NUNS.
FORMER SPEECH WRITER FOR
PRESIDENT
43ESIDENT
43BIIDENT
43BILLENT
43BILL MT
43BILL MCGURN.
BILL, WELCOME BACK.
THAT IS A NUN THAT YOU KNOW.
>> RIGHT.
BRIAN: HER PICTURE WAS PUT
UP GENERICALLY FOR A LAUGH.
HOT IS NUN YOU KNOW.
>> THE NUN I KNOW IS SISTER
PATTED POMPA.
SISTER OF ACADEMY TWO OF MY
DAUGHTERS GRADUATED FROM AND
ONE IS A FRESHMAN.
THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
WOMAN WHOSE LIFE IS
SACRIFICED FOR THE EDUCATION
OF GIRLS.
BRIAN: WERE YOU STUNNED TO
SEE JIMMY KIMMEL PERHAPS
RANDOMLY AS A NUN TO
RIDICULE HER LOOKS?
>> YEAH.
I THOUGHT THIS WOMAN, LOOK,
ON THE SCALE OF THING AS NUN
JOKE ISN'T THAT HIGH.
IN THE SENSE WE HAVE GOT
CHRISTIANS BEING BEHEADED
OVERSEAS AND CHURCHES BURNT
DOWN.
THIS ISN'T SUCH A BIG DEAL.
NOT ABOUT HATING ON JIMMY
KIMMEL BUT THIS WOMAN HAS
PUT THE NEEDS OF OTHERS AT
THE CENTER OF HER LIFE AND
LIVED THIS RICH, FULL LIFE
AND KEEPS THIS SCHOOL GOING.
SHE DESERVES MORE THAN TO BE
THE LAUGH LINE OF LATE NIGHT
TV.
BRIAN: WHAT HAS BEEN THE
FEELING AMONG THE PARENTS
WHO SEND THEIR KIDS TO THAT
STORY OR AMONG THE GRADUATES
WHO KNOW HER?
>> YEAH.
I THINK, I MEAN IN SOME
WAYS, LOOK, AGAIN, IT'S NOT
ABOUT HATING ON JIMMY
KIMMEL, I DON'T THINK HE
INTENDED ANY HARM.
AND IN SOME WAYS IT MAY BE
THIS IS A WAY TO BRING HER
STORY OUT IN THE PUBLIC.
IF HE HADN'T DONE THAT I
WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN THE
COLUMN.
AND I'M HEARING FROM A LOT
OF PEOPLE, SOME THAT KNOW
SISTER PAT AND SOME THAT
KNOW SISTER PATS IN THEIR
OWN LIFE.
THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO PUT
THE NEEDS OF OTHERS BEFORE
THEIR OWN.
BRIAN: WHAT HAS BEEN HER
REACTION?
DOES SHE EVEN KNOW WHO JIMMY
KIMMEL IS.
>> I'M NOT SURE SHE KNOWS.
I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T GIVE IT
A MOMENT'S THOUGHT.
SHE IS JUST TOO BUSY.
THIS PROVES THAT THE SCHOOL,
YOU KNOW, IT IS BASED ON
DISCIPLINE, WHICH COMES FROM
THE LATIN TO INSTRUCT.
IT'S REALLY BUILT ON LOVE.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE
PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW
SISTER PAT KNOW THAT THIS IS
AN ENTERPRISE OF LOVE.
LOVE IS NOT HALLMARK.
LOVE IS BEING THERE FOR THE
GIRL THAT GETS PREGNANT.
FOR THE GIRL THAT HAS DRUG
PROBLEM.
THE GIRL WHO LOST HER MOM TO
CANCER.
THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS.
AND THAT'S THE PROMISE THAT
SISTER MAKES TO THESE GIRLS.
I CAN'T PROTECT YOU FROM ALL
OF LIFE'S TRIALS AND
TRIBULATIONS.
BUT YOU WILL NEVER HURT
ALONE.
BRIAN: SO YOU WROTE THIS
COLUMN, AND THE RESPONSE HAS
BEEN OVERWHELMING BECAUSE IN
THE #ME TOO MOVEMENT SHOULD
WE REALLY BE RIDICULING
SOMEONE HOW THEY LOOK?
>> AGAIN, IT'S A LITTLE JOKE
BUT THERE IS A RICH LIFE AND
A HUMAN BEING BEHIND.
THIS AND THE HUMAN BEING WHO
HAS DONE EXTRAORDINARY
THINGS.
I MEAN, SHE WAS HELD UP
BECAUSE SHE IS NOT
FASHIONABLE.
HER CLOTHING IS DISMISSED AS
A LINE FROM J.C. PENNEYS.
HER CLOTHE SOMETHING A
STATEMENT THAT I HAVE MORE
HIRE PRIORITIES THAN THE
WORLD AND FASHION AND SO
FORTH.
IT'S ABOUT THE DENIAL OF
SELF TO SERVING OTHERS.
THERE ARE GENERATIONS OF
WOMEN THAT HAVE BENEFITED.
I MEAN, WE DROP OUR KIDS OFF
AS GIRLS TO SISTER PAT, YOU
KNOW, UNSURE, UNFORMED.
AND FOUR YEARS LATER THEY
WALK OUT STRONG, CONFIDENT
WOMEN.
BRIAN: AND TO SEE HER MOCKED
BOTHERED YOU?
>> YEAH.
IT BOTHERED ME.
AGAIN, ON A SCALE OF THINGS,
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T OUTRAGED.
BUT I JUST THINK THIS LIFE
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
SISTER PATS ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY.
IT JUST DESERVES BETTER.
IT DESERVES A LITTLE MORE
RESPECT AND FOR PEOPLE TO
KNOW, YOU KNOW, BEHIND THIS
CARICATURE, INCREDIBLY JONG
WOMAN.
YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR
CHRISTIE'S KIDS WENT TO THE
SAME SCHOOL.
HE TWEETED OUT SUGGESTING
THAT JIMMY KIMMEL HAVE HER
ON TO SHARE WITH THE
AUDIENCE WHAT A LIFE OF
SACRIFICE MEANS ANDS JOYS
THAT COME FROM IT.
BRIAN: THAT WILL BE GREAT.
IT'S A REAL PERSON NOT A
GENERIC PICTURE EVEN KNOW IT
