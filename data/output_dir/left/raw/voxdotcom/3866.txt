1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,550
Ladies and gentlemen, the first American to
orbit the Earth.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,650
Here's to Flint.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,860
The latest now in Flint, Michigan.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,060
A water crisis there.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,589
No justice, no peace.

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:25,380
At times it seems like the forces pulling
us apart are stronger than the forces binding

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,380
us together.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:38,750
Ladies and gentlemen, we have detected gravitational
waves.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,450
Opioid addiction is now officially an epidemic.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,890
We now lose 100 Americans a day from overdoses
on prescription medicines and heroin.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,980
I went from smoking weed and snorting pain
medication in in my dorm room, to being homeless

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,640
and shooting heroin under a bridge.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,350
The British people have voted to leave the
European Union.

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,010
This is mass hysteria at the moment.

15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,820
Those on the losing side of the argument,
myself included, should help to make it work.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,250
Today marks the most deadly shooting in American
history.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,360
Some 50 dead reported in Orlando.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,440
The shooter targeted a gay nightclub he frequented

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,790
We've taken a lot of steps forward and something
like this just makes all those steps be erased.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:33,170
And love is love is love is love is love is
love is love is love cannot be killed or swept

21
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,170
aside.

22
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,100
Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the
Phillippines in May, on a promises of waging

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,420
a "bloody war on drugs."

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,530
I'd be happy to slaughter them.

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,770
Breaking news out of Turkey where tensions
remain high this morning after a night of

26
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,770
explosions.

27
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,520
President Erdogan called into Turkish television,
using FaceTime and urging citizens to flood

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,360
the streets and resist the coup.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,320
More than 10,000 civil servants have now been
fired after the July 15th coup attempt.

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,150
The question among terror experts is not will
there be another terror attack, but when?

31
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,130
Please don't tell me that he's gone.

32
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,699
Please officer, please don't tell me that
you just did this to him.

33
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,680
Philando Castile and Alton Sterling were shot
and killed by police within a day of each

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
other.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,640
Rallies and protests across the country, in
response to the violent scene during the sniper

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,430
style takedown of officers in Dallas.

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,210
Pray and hope that this never happens in America
again.

38
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,540
The selection must be about bringing our people
together.

39
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,840
And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Mark my words.

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,890
I'm not gonna pay for that fucking wall.

42
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,100
And just as with our founders, there are no
guarantees.

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,840
It truly is up to us.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,260
The WHO today rejected a plea by 150 health
experts who argue that the games risked speeding

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,340
up the spread of Zika globally.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,430
The most decorated athlete in Olympic history
is calling it quits by hanging another gold

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,460
around his neck.

48
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,700
Millions of people worldwide are hunting for
pokemon everywhere around them.

49
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,140
But it seems there are some places anyway
they can't go.

50
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:19,130
How sweet it is, after a 108 years the Cubs
win the world series.

51
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,880
The star quarterbacks refusal to stand during
the world anthem.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,459
This country stands for freedom, liberty,
justice for all.

53
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,890
And it's not happening for all right now.

54
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,569
I don't even wait.

55
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,200
And when you're a star, they let you do it.

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Whatever you want.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,830
Grab em by the pussy.

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:42,590
And I can't believe that I'm saying that a
candidate for President of the United States

59
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,230
has bragged about sexually assaulting women.

60
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,330
In a stunning upset that reverberated around
the world

61
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:56,790
Donald Trump won with 306 electoral votes,
even though Hillary Clinton got nearly 2.5

62
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,920
million more popular votes.

63
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,239
This political stuff is nasty and it's tough.

64
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:12,680
But please, never stop believing that fighting
for what's right is worth it.

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,519
Thousands fled Aleppo after government forces
captured large portions of the city from rebel

66
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,519
fighters.

67
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,740
10s of thousands of terrified civilians were
streaming out of eastern Aleppo.

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,949
The UN weather agency says 2016 could break
the record for the hottest year since they

69
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,629
started keeping track in the 19th century.

70
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:35,310
Eventually, history suggests there will be
some doomsday event.

71
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,789
The path this country has taken has never
been a straight line.

72
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:43,130
We zig and zag.

73
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:51,129
For many, many thousands of years, people
had looked up and wondered about what was

74
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,280
up there.

75
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,360
The alternative is to become a space-faring
civilization and a multi-planet species.

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,719
And we must consider ourselves among the most
fortunate of generations for we have lived

77
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,830
at a time when the dream became a reality.

78
00:05:04,830 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you would agree that is the right way
to go, yes?
