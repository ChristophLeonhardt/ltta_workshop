it seems like the country is more divided than ever and that we can't agree on anything but there's one thing Americans are overwhelmingly in support of we want money out of our politics polling shows that eighty-one percent of Democrats and 79 percent of Republicans want the parties to work together to reduce the influence of money in politics with 81 percent of Americans saying that money in politics is a bigger problem than ever before it was also one of the top five most important issues for Democrats and independents and top six for Republicans going into 2016 and that's because it affects literally every issue want action on climate change too bad the oil and gas industry spent over 102 million dollars on purchasing politicians last election cycle how about regulating Wall Street's they don't crash the economy again not so fast the financial industry gave 273 million dollars in donations to federal candidates in 2016 gun control may be just that because children are being slaughtered and 75 percent of Americans want stricter gun laws forget about it the NRA and other gun groups spent a record fifty four million dollars in 2016 to ensure that wouldn't happen so why is no one in power talking about it well because that's the issue in itself our politicians are literally bought off by that money so they're not going to bring it up six point five billion dollars was the final amount spent in the 2016 presidential and congressional elections that's enough to fix the Flint Michigan lead pipe problem 30 times over or give every public school teacher a $2,000 raise conveniently the only politicians who seem to care about money in politics get their money not from large contributors or corporations but from small individual donors a real issue is that our campaign finance system and let me underline the word don't diss poke the others it is a corrupting system and since most of our politicians aren't bringing up this issue that polling shows is one of the American people's top priorities well then the media should write not so much campaign advertisements are a multi-billion dollar industry with 4.4 billion dollars spent on broadcast TV ads in 2016 our corrupt campaign finance system is profitable for the media which is why they don't bring up the topic except when discussing their profit margins now ousted CBS executive les Moonves said that super PACs may be bad for America but they're very good for CBS thanks for being honest I guess but how did it get this bad well it's a long story but it boils down to this in 1976 the Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v Valeo that spending money is an expression of speech under the Constitution basically that money equals speech at the same time the courts had ruled for a few decades that corporations have personhood rights the right to property to contract etc but from Buckley v Valeo on they had free speech rights and it was cemented in the infamous 2010 Citizens United case which connected the two money is speech plus corporations our people equals corporations can speak by spending money in elections and when money is speech that means that the more money you have the more speech you have and if corporations are people people who have a lot more money than you and I that means that corporations have a lot more speech than the rest of us it's patently absurd and it's completely destroying our democracy don't believe me but 2014 Princeton study found that when the Preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for the Preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule near-zero statistically nonsignificant impact upon public policy yeah our democracy is non-existent right now let's not sugarcoat it but there is good news things are changing for the better since senator Bernie Sanders forced the issue onto the national stage during the presidential election Democrats have been forced to act senators Cory Booker Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand and more followed Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren's lead and rejected corporate pac money Elizabeth Warren has introduced an anti-corruption bill targeting corporate donors and the revolving lobbyists or high profile candidates like Beto O'Rourke and the 26 Justice Democrats Alexandra Ocasio cortes Rasheeda Talib and James Thompson running in the general election are all refusing corporate PAC money and there will be even more candidates like them as long as we keep this movement going you can do your part to help in this fight by joining us the only media that will actually call out politicians and their corruption and support candidates who will work to end that corruption join the fight by becoming a member of the Young Turks at TYT dot-com /join you'll always be at home here at TYT the home of progressives
