wish is or else it won't come true but

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,489

you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell anyone how will they know</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't tell anyone they have a</font>

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,350
good reason not to fulfill it so I'm

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,090
Friday much first this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,800
launching a global Internet campaign

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
called turn a blind eye no longer and my

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">birthday wish is for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to get involved</font>

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,090
and are you thinking this is such a mile

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,670
thing and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so simple but first</font>

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,410
a quick story in my final year of high

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,090
school I entered the a new public

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,100
speaking competition where in front of

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,170
the school I criticized the school rules

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,629
and exposed corruption that was going on

27
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,880
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> before giving that speech I gave the</font>

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,650
written version to my head of<font color="#CCCCCC"> year out</font>

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">of politeness so they could check it and</font>

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,640
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> said that if I was to give that</font>

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,100
speech serious actions would be taken

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,810
against me so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> made the speech anyway</font>

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,729
and the school was<font color="#E5E5E5"> unable to punish me</font>

34
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the vast majority of students</font>

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,590
and teachers agreed with what I said and

36
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,900
what's my point well it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's only</font>

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we speak out against injustice</font>

38
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,590
publicly that we provide an opportunity

39
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,890
for others to agree and do the same and

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,420
therefore it's only when I break my

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,030
birthday wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> from secret see that I can</font>

42
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,040
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real opportunity for others to</font>

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,960
stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me and hopefully achieve</font>

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,090
something great so before Friday March

45
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,100
the first I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to get a camera it</font>

46
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video camera</font>

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,140
phone webcam or even a photo with you as

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,090
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> voiceover and then record a video it</font>

49
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,740
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very long in which</font>

50
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,020
you publicly introduce yourself and then

51
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,520
declare that you are not afraid of

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,860
governments and you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not afraid to</font>

53
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,290
call out corruption when you see it now

54
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,210
if that's a bit too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much to ask for then</font>

55
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,369
you can talk about corruption in a

56
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,409
societal sense maybe amongst your

57
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,770
community maybe when at<font color="#CCCCCC"> work or in a</font>

58
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,740
school corruption is bad no<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

59
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,110
where it happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that you</font>

60
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,760
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in this now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,870
signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> who doesn't know of any</font>

62
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,210
corruption right now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's okay the</font>

63
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,890
whole aim of this campaign is to make

64
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,630
people collectively become more vigilant

65
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,760
this is for people all over the world to

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">get involved in regardless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,660
beliefs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and political loyalties and if</font>

68
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,580
you know anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has a camera get</font>

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,380

71
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,550

73
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,690
year I really want to see everyone I've

74
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,640
ever known on YouTube get involved and

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,740
if you're a big youtuber and feel this

76
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,990
may conflict with your brand then do it

77
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,640
on a new channel there should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,590
controversial about saying that you will

79
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,330
call out corruption when you see it many

80
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,220
of us remember bullying at school there

81
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,230
may be a time even when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you regret not</font>

82
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,120
doing more to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> others or maybe there</font>

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,960
wish someone was there well we all know

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">are much bigger bullies that exist and</font>

87
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,780
