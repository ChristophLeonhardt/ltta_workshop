1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
(light music)

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,211
So we're currently outside of
the Christie's Headquarters

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:09,386
in New York before the biggest
evening sale of the year.

4
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:11,090
Where literally hundred
of millions of dollars

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,664
worth of art is going to be
sold within a matter of hours.

6
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:16,308
Let's check out some of the highlights.

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,891
(groovy music)

8
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:26,823
So Alex, we are underneath
Christie's in a secure room

9
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:29,542
where some of the most
valuable lots of the upcoming

10
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:33,136
post-war and contemporary
art sales are being housed.

11
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:35,245
That's what we refer to as the vault.

12
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,455
The vault of paintings
gets stacked up and ready

13
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,608
for the big viewing experience.

14
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:41,935
So what are we looking at right now?

15
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:44,608
This is a painting by one
of the most well-known

16
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:46,677
artists in our field,
Jean-Michel Basquiat.

17
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,645
It's very aggressively painted.

18
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:52,693
His paintings are about
the feeling of a black man

19
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:56,086
living in the United States in the 1980's.

20
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,749
And how much does it cost?

21
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,674
We have estimated this painting

22
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:03,007
called Il Duce, 25 to 35 million dollars

23
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,573
and the pricing is based on
what we feel of the quality

24
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:10,091
of the painting, but it's also
based on what we know about

25
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:12,830
the private market for
Jean-Michel Basquiat.

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,390
This is an A+ painting from this artist

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,475
who is very hot right now,
it falls in line with what

28
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:24,642
we've seen in the last
three or four years really.

29
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:29,922
So behind us is a very different work

30
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:33,447
by Mark Rothko from 1957.

31
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:37,112
It's a hard shift from Basquiat to Rothko,

32
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:38,603
but it's also wonderful shift.

33
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,797
Rothko is one of the
father's of the purely

34
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:43,458
abstract painting, the
gestural abstraction.

35
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,946
Rothko, Pollock, are the
ones that really opened

36
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,950
the mind to the abstract form.

37
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,781
What is this estimated to sell for?

38
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,763
Interestingly enough, it's
also 25 to 35 million dollars,

39
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:55,702
so it's in the same price
bracket, very different feeling.

40
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:56,926
Yeah.

41
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,619
So another painting from 1957,

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,747
so the same year, Cy
Twombly Sunset painting.

43
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,050
The Twombly is about 20 million dollars,

44
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,132
the same year as Rothko,
so it's interesting

45
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:11,247
to see them actually in a
sequence because it's two great

46
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,783
abstract artists of the post-war period.

47
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:18,105
So, we looked at two 35
million dollar paintings,

48
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,023
one 20 million dollar painting.

49
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:23,375
These are like the greatest
hits of the art market today.

50
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:28,223
Do you have anything coming
up in the sales for the mere

51
00:02:28,223 --> 00:02:29,728
millionaires to purchase?

52
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,337
Absolutely, we have
something for everyone.

53
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,468
Let me just go to the next rack here

54
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:37,785
and see a wonderful Kerry James Marshall,

55
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:40,801
priced at one to one and
a half million dollars.

56
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,955
A bargain.

57
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:42,863
A bargain.

58
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,281
This is a different price range.

59
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:47,319
Beautiful canvas, rare to
come to the auction market.

60
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,077
Just coming off some wonderful
museum shows in America,

61
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:54,193
in New York, in LA, we have
very high expectations.

62
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:55,662
It's a really beautiful painting.

63
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,723
This is a perfect storm
of very high-profile and

64
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:01,549
high-priced artworks coming
together at a specific point.

65
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,954
Do you think that we can extrapolate

66
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:06,500
from how these paintings
do, to get a better sense

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,451
of how the art market is or
where the art market is going,

68
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:11,084
or do you think that we
should really, kind of

69
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,672
consider this sale in a vacuum.

70
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:16,461
I think you can definitely
get a general read

71
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:19,381
off the art market after the
sale, once the results are in.

72
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:21,035
What day is the sale?

73
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,259
Big night is November 15th.

74
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,035
Okay, and that's when all of the works

75
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:26,370
that we've just seen...

76
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,203
And many more

77
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:29,948
... and many more, are gonna
go up on the auction block,

78
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:31,852
and we'll see how they do.

79
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:32,685
Exactly.

80
00:03:32,685 --> 00:00:00,000
