00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,050
Scientists from the
Guy Harvey Research Institute

2
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,589
and Save Our Seas Shark Research Center
are tagging sharks off the coast of

3
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,140
Fort Lauderdale as seen below.
The researchers are working alongside

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,810
a group of students as part of
efforts to raise awareness

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,720
about the critical
role that sharks play

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,350
in maintaining healthy oceans.

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,620
To catch sharks the group baits
drum lines with fish heads.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,200
Once caught they're secured
to the back of the boat,

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
tagged and measured.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,060
Students swab the gills,
fins and teeth for bacteria

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,809
and take genetic samples that can
be studied later in the lab.

12
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,409
One of the key research goals
for the project is to decode

13
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,939
the DNA of sharks in order
to better understand

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:00:00,000
how the animals have evolved over 
400 million years.
