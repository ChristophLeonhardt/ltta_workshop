it's the drive to modernize Saudi Arabia taking a wrong turn more women activists are arrested days before the kingdom lifts its ban on female drivers as economic political and cultural reforms are implemented our Saudi leaders sending out mixed messages this is inside story hello and welcome to the program today with me Peter Dhabi female activists continued to be arrested in Saudi Arabia - in the past three days rights groups say mia al Zahrani was detained for her posts on social media expressing support for neuf Abdul Aziz Al Jarreau II who's also been locked up Saudi security forces have arrested 17 activists in the past month most of them women who've long campaigned for the right to drive a car now that is about to happen in two weeks time the first driving licences have been instituted before the kingdom lifts its controversial men-only ban state media has accused the arrested activists of being foreign agents the Saudi vision 2030 as a plan to reduce dependence on oil that reforms proposed by the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman are controversial in the religiously conservative Kingdom dozens of members of the royal family government ministers and businessmen were arrested in a purge against corruption most were released after giving up their assets or paying billions of dollars to the government bin Salman pledged to move Saudi to a more open and tolerant interpretation of Islam the reforms affect education law and the courts traditionally controlled by the religious leaders in the country for the first time in history Saudi women are being allowed to drive and to attend sports events an almost 40-year ban on cinemas and cultural events has ended bin Salman plans to build the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund as well as a five hundred billion dollar futuristic city called neon and a stake in the National Oil Company Aramco is up for sale okay there we are here we go let's bring in our guests from London that we're joined by Sami Hamdi editor-in-chief of international interest that's a current affairs analysis magazine with a focus on the Middle East and from Amman on skype Seward Abu daya that Mena regional consultant for equality now and also from London ma'am do Salome an international oil economists welcome to you all Sami Hamdi if I can come to you first just explain to us for you why do you think women are being detained in this way in Saudi Arabia I think what we have to understand is that the whole allowing women to drive in Saudi Arabia was mainly a PR move it was not designed by Mohammed bin Salman to be a sweeping revolution revolutionising the Saudi system however the problem inside Arabia now is that because they've allowed the women to drive for Mohammed bin Salman suddenly the activists are asking for more they're asking for too much at to quickly change something that Mohammed bin Salman is not prepared to do and something that he perhaps cannot do because the pace of change if it is too quick it inif invites a revolt it invites protests domestically from the reduced authorities and even from the common people from the common population because we have to be aware of one thing in terms of how these reforms are being received and how liberalisation is being received it's being seen as a copy-paste version of Europe in that those advocates of liberalisation are seeking to establish almost another quasi European state in Saudi Arabia I say this because the European version of liberalisation imagined in the aftermath of the bitter war with the church and as a result it relegated the religious influence to the personal and private sphere the Arab world of the Islamic world has no equivalent of this war this britta traumatic war that Europe went through in other words Islam in the Arab world in the Islamic world is considered akin to prosperity to glory to everything associated with the Golden Age so when Mohammed bin Salman is bringing in concepts from Europe from America when it's being pushed by the US by Europeans by liberal activists there is a sort of reservation amongst Arab society in general not just Mohammed bin Salman so even if Mohammed bin Salman wants to implement these measures he is very wary that they will be a backlash you have to remember that in Arab society they are told that it is the pious Saladin who conquered Jerusalem it is the pious elicina who was the father of Medicine it was the pious abu hamid al-ghazali who inspired st. Thomas Aquinas who inspired Adam Smith the father of economics it was the pious and Jabbar who established algebra in other words it's all to do with religion so when Mohammed bin Salman is talking about liberalisation talking about moderate Islam talking about a more tolerant Islam these are rhetoric this is rhetoric that is dominant in Europe and in the US and it has been received with much reservation in the Arab world so in terms of these activists who's been arrested I think the key problem is this Mohammed min Sandman is basically saying to them don't get overexcited I let you drive and I gave you the right to drive but you guys are pushing this pace way too patient way too fast and this big hysteria that you have you need to calm down so I need to teach you a lesson and put you in prison for a bit okay you've laid out all the main issues here that we're going to discuss the next half-hour sir Budhia do we know where these women are what sort of conditions they're living under and not at the point do we know when they'll be released well we don't really have any information about where these women have been I mean in which prison they are we don't have information from Saudi Arabia there is a complete silence from actually the government also about where they are and why they have been arresting them in addition even the activists who are still outside the prison or who have not been arrested they are also afraid to reveal any information if they know so the situation is very much alarming in Saudi Arabia and maybe I I contradict or I am not really supporting what my colleague has said a little bit about you know having all these developments in Saudi Arabia as a westernized issues this is not quite true I mean I am living in in Jordan and I am all my life I have been I am an Arab and Palestinian and we have we are witnessing so many amendments and so many developments in regard to the developments of and enhancement of women's rights in the region sorry if you look at what's going on in Tunisia in Morocco in Algeria even in Jordan last year they have repealed some parts some articles in the personnel in the Penal Code where rape laws has been repealed in Jordan and in Lebanon so the women's movements in the region they are calling for for for their rights for years by now it's not really a westernized issue it is more that women are aware that they are citizens and they need to be treated as citizens in their communities and then in their societies understood so I just want to take a couple of those points and boil those down and put them - ma'am - Salome ma'am - Salome if you're MBs if you're the crown prince and you have a reform program surely a reform program is a whole it's it's it's an entity you can't reform a little bit you've got to reform everything you've got to be more liberal you've got to be more outward looking and that's what we're talking about today I guess is a symptom of that as opposed to a cause of that well let me start by saying that Saudi Arabia and its budget depend on the oil resources to the tune of 90% and since the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia in 1938 they have never they diversified their economy now they are talking and they talked before about diversification so vision 2030 is another name for diversification I using reducing dependence on oil in their economy still I don't think that the reform program covered by vision 2030 will achieve much I must admit it's a step in the right direction but I don't think it will achieve much and certainly not in the short term for instance when the vision was launched in 2016 it included a clause that said they need to create 10 million jobs because unemployment among the young in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi population is very young indeed they needed 10 million million jobs before 2020 I don't think that will be achievable in even 20 years short of expelling expatriates out of Saudi Arabia then you are talking about reforming the oil industry the talk has been for the last more than 50 or 60 years and they have not achieved much they are still dependent on oil and they are still excessive in their spending of the oil wealth of Saudi Arabia ok you talk about education and you find that their universities or most of them are not geared to produce people who are employable in the 21st century ok Sami Hamdi let's put that point to you it occurs to me that raising a voice is an offence but it's not being codified as being something that we could that we could number that we could label because for example one of the women drivers her lawyer has been detained as well simply for talking about this in public so if you go public about the issue what's going on there I think this is nothing new this has been the Arab world for the last 30 40 50 years I mean if you're talking to me as an Arab this doesn't feel like anything strange this is what governments have been doing for ages Sisi is doing it just across the border in most of the Arab countries this thing's these things take place as well I just want to mention PETA in terms of the Honorable guest who said that you know there is not the problem of westernization I'm not saying that I'm talking about the perception people are perceiving this as a westernization as Mohammed bin Salman trying to bring in westernization and even if we talk about personal experiences living in Jordan or the like we should be aware that there are some very important signs about the resistance to liberalisation that is taking place in the Arab world think about the elections after the Arab Spring in the first free and fair elections who dominated it was Islamist leaning parties they are the ones who dominated the Liberals were very very far behind look at the reaction to this Turkish drama Netflix dalish el turo which is taking the Muslim world by storm why it doesn't have any special Hollywood epic scenes it's only because the the hero is somebody who believes his success comes from God or comes from his religion in other words this is there it's deeply rooted in society and the reason why I say this is because the implementation of liberalisation as it's being advocated today is counter to what many people in the Arab society wants in other words it's coming in as you have to think about it why is liberalization in the Arab world according to many Arabs according to many Muslims it is the result of a rabid colonial oppressor who came in and demolished an Islamic empire that had deviated from Islamic principles so in other words liberalization today is simply the victor imposing their own values on a people the Arab societies are saying look you have a ready-made recipe for success it is in Islam and Islamic principles if we're talking about women's rights Islam guarantees human rights pursue it in the framework of Islam okay which has known that idea suet of a country becoming liberal can a country like Saudi Arabia liberalized itself unless it has a genuine liberal leadership because what Sami seems to be saying is that people are prepared to protest as and when they want to to get more liberal rights and yet they are gifted to them and taken away by people who are completely illiberal yeah I think I mean not just for Saudi Arabia I think we need a time and I think change is becoming very slow I mean in the region but surely it will come I mean I I really believe that of course now I mean there isn't there isn't any genuine really will political will in Saudi Arabia so to speak about really liberating women and also granting women their rights still for example male guardianship system is is there women they can't travel abroad because they have to have their permission of their male guardian either their fathers their brothers their husbands whatever the right to to even study abroad they have to be accompanied by a male guardian so I yes there are still we are living in a very harsh situations as women in the region but I think slowly but surely the the advancement and progress progressive developments of women's position will be coming very slowly but surely you know as I mentioned we are we are witnessing lots of developments in other region Tunisia in in March 2000 this year I participated in a demonstration where women's groups human rights organizations political parties they are demanding for equal inheritance rights so this is this is for us in that in the Arab region is quite a very progressive step that women are taking lead and you know asking for their rights because I mean the we are living in a difference to you know women now are hitting the feminine they are sorry sorry go ahead Sami what was the point you for 20 of the minority I'm saying the using the example of inheritance is a very very bad example only because it does not take into context of society the other rules in society it cannot be called progressives what Sipsey has done here is appeal to an international audience a secular audience at the expense of a majority semi conservative society it is a tyranny of the minority what Sipsey is doing in Tunisia but the rest of your points I mean I can go women's rights definitely there should be more pain okay just one yeah for the 11.2 ma'am to salary in London how much of this you've already touched on this how much of this say when we look at a situation surrounding the company Aramco is about a country's ability to look outward instead of being insular and looking in on itself there are other countries in this region that are quite outward looking and they are or they have successfully diversified into other industries because they're playing a long game the game is as long as the game that Saudi Arabia is playing but Saudi Arabia still behaves as if it expects the rest of the world to come to Riyadh as opposed to reared going to the rest of the world well sooner or later they will need the world to deal with them and help them the diversification program you refer to is not going to achieve much shortly when you talk about Saudi Aramco which is the main source of income for Saudi Arabia they are talking about the IPO which is the initial public offering of selling 5% of Saudi Arab could not be productive assets of oil but different assets 400 billion dollars that is not going to happen and I will tell you why because the Saudis have valued the IPO at more than hundred billion dollars that cannot be right because based on the proven reserves of all they have many organizations including Wall Street Journal and the World Bank and many other analysts said that the value could be based on smaller proven reserves Saudi Arabia says it has proven sales of 268 billion barrels my research shows that that is between 80 and 90 billion and many other experts also agree with that so if you base the IPO value of that smaller reserves I think the value of the IPO is between 50 to 75 billion still Saudi Arabia with the rising oil prices now it does not have to sell any percentage in the Saudi Aramco it doesn't need the mana financially with the improvement of oil prices that's why I say the IPO is not going to happen what will happen in diversification is concentrate on adding value to your oil exports instead of exporting oil as crude oil exported as refined products more petrochemicals Saudi Arabia could we have the next two or three years dominate the petrochemical industries in the world and become the major producer and the major exporter furthermore they can use even 5% of their oil revenue to expand food production that's an important part Saudi Arabia imports more than 30 billion dollars a year of food materials come mostly coming from ok ok yoky point mandu is clear then you're basically saying that they have had and they will continue to have an awful lot of money in the bank so they can absorb the hit suh add to what degree is this a difficult course Suat what one want one question to you to what degree is this a difficult course for bin Salman to plot in as much as when there was the vogue when there was the Vogue magazine cover of a Saudi princess posing in a car because she's got her driver's license or she will have her driver's license there was a backlash against that not against per se women driving but against the fact that MBS has has opened up this Pandora's box his critics might say of cosmetic changes but how easy is it for him to partially close that Pandora's box well I I really didn't see the that you are mentioning about the princess of Saudi Arabia driving and the whole debate about that but I want really to comment on what my colleague has just mentioned is that yes I mean I don't agree with him that what I have mentioned about Tunisia is there is a negative or a bad example because this is just just to show and indicate that women are rare you know asking for their rights in the in our countries to the extent that it might according to some interpretations it might contradict Islam and the Sharia so this is one one aspect of that I mean I if we want to concentrate on women driving in Saudi Arabia I don't think it is just the issue of women you know just calling for the driving they have been activists for years you know calling for ending male guardianship system which controls every aspect of their life I think we have I mean the right as women in the region and elsewhere to be treated as citizens in the countries we have lots lots of discrimination in the law and in the implementation of the laws and in our cultures although we have good sometimes good traditions and cultures where women should be respected and you know and even Islam you know they provide women with respect and so on but still I mean discrimination is there and we need to change the attitudes of people you know by working with the communities I I really believe that it is a long process a slow process but we have to dig and and continue women in the region has been working for years and still discrimination is there okay we are we are heading towards the end of the program very very quickly so one more point to Samy Hamdi in London what is it about the Saudi leadership that they appear to be tone deaf to the the nuances that other countries are expecting them to apply when it comes to this process of becoming more liberal and opening I think the Liberals don't give Saudi a break I mean you have to think about there's a lack of ugh that like I explained in beginning there's a lack of understanding as to just how deeply embedded these religious influences I mean what you want Mohammed bin Salman to do to go banging down on every single door and telling everybody it's time to be liberal this is a if he wants to implement it has to be a process but also his Western allies don't help him at all by forcing him into a position to be pro-israel in the israel-palestine cause I mean the biggest problem is this and in the Muslim world there is a very stark comparison to Mohammed insulin in the region that is Aragon el tucan unashamedly Muslim he rebuked Angela Merkel publicly publicly for using the term Islamist terrorism he opposed Trump's ban and he's defying Washington you compare that to Mohammed bin Salman who is going to Washington and bleeding to be king or Mohammed bin Zayed and then UAE justifying Trump's travel ban there is a very there is a dichotomy now in the region and many people prefer el tucan approach because it's more Islamist the Western allies are telling Mohammed bin Salman you need to be quicker Mohammed bin Salman is sitting there in his chair thinking okay if I go I won't put the last point of the program to do Salome London as well in 30 seconds ma'am do because we are out of time if these women who've been detained praised the government and thanked them for the right to drive as opposed to pay praise the campaigners who they might say got them the right to drive would they now not be under tension well rather than answer that question in direct way I will say that we will not see any reforms regarding woman or any other reforms in Saudi Arabia in the short term I would venture to say we wouldn't see it even in 25 years you have to separate the aspects of religion from running a country a modern country and that cannot be reconciled in Saudi Arabia in my lifetime if not further beyond okay we must leave it there thank you all so much for your time today thanks to all our guests from London Sami Hamdi who joined us from the British capital in a man we
