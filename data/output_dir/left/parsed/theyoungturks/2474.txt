AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN UTAH
IS CATCHING A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT
BECAUSE OF A POLICY THAT THEY
HAD FOR THEIR ST.
VALENTINE'S
DAY DANCE.
THE SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATORS BELIEVE THAT IT
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO LET THE
FEMALES IN THE SCHOOL KNOW THAT
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY NO
TO THE BOYS WHO ASK THEM TO
DANCE AND ONE OF THE PARENTS WAS
JUSTIFIABLY OUTRAGED BY THIS.
WHEN NATALIE RICHARDS REACHED
OUT TO 
THE PRINCIPAL:
SHE ALSO SAID:
OKAY, SO BASICALLY THESE LITTLE
GIRLS ARE NOT ALLOWED, BASED ON
THIS GROWTH POLICY, NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY NO WHEN A BOY ASKS HER TO
DANCE BECAUSE THE FEELINGS FOR
THE LITTLE BOYS TEND TO BE A
LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
FEELINGS THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS
HAVE.
THIS IS SUCH A BAD IDEA
AND I AM GLAD THAT THE PARENT
HERE CALLED THEM OUT ON IT.
I
DO NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY
ARE PLANNING ON CHANGING THE
POLICY BUT IT SENDS A REALLY BAD
MESSAGE BECAUSE ONE OF THE
BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WE ARE
SEEING WITH THIS ME TO MOVEMENT
IS THE FACT THAT THE MEN
WHO ARE BEING ACCUSED OF
PREDATORY BEHAVIOR OR ANY
TYPE OF MISCONDUCT HAD A SENSE
OF ENTITLEMENT AND I THINK
THAT IT IS SOCIETAL
CONDITIONING.
IT IS THE TYPE OF CULTURE THAT
WE'VE HAD IN THE UNITED
STATES FOR A LONG TIME WHEN MEN
HAVE BEEN TOLD TIME AND TIME
AGAIN THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO
CERTAIN THINGS AND ALSO ON
THE FLIPSIDE, YOU ARE TELLING
WOMEN THAT THEY SHOULD FEEL BAD
IF THEY SAY NO TO A GUY, THAT
THEY SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE GUYS FEELINGS AS
OPPOSED TO THEIR OWN FEELINGS.
THIS SETS A REALLY DANGEROUS
STANDARD AND I HOPE THAT
THE SCHOOL CHANGES THEIR MINDS
ABOUT IT.
I KNOW THIS IS A PROGRESSIVE
OR CONSERVATIVE THING BECAUSE IT
MIGHT BE PROGRESSIVE IN THAT YOU
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL BAD OR
FEEL LEFT OUT SO IT REMINDS ME
OF WHEN THEY CANCELED HUGGING A
GRADUATION AT SOME OF THE
SCHOOLS, REMEMBER WE DID A
STORY?
I DON'T. BECAUSE OF HOW THE
UNHOOKED FELT.
I'M SERIOUS,
THAT IS A REAL STORY GOT SO I DO
NOT KNOW IF WE ARE NOT YOUR
RUN-OF-THE-MILL LIBERALS OR
WHATEVER.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
A LIBERAL POLICY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY POLITICS
BEHIND THE STUCK.
AND IT IS UTAH WHICH IS
OVERALL VERY CONSERVATIVE BUT
ANYWAY, IT IS OKAY IF EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE SOMEONE SAYS NO,
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT AND IS
TALKING ABOUT.
THESE ARE
SIXTH-GRADERS AND YOU ARE
TEACHING THEM.
THE RULE IS
LITERALLY CALLED JUST DON'T SAY
NO.
THIS IS CRAZY.
IT'S
INSANE.
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS
CONVERSATION, LET'S EXTEND THIS
TO A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY DIDN'T
BELIEVE OCCURRED BUT ACTUALLY
DOES OCCUR AND I FEEL LIKE WE
NEED TO ADDRESS IT, THE CODDLING
THING BECAUSE CODDLING IS
ACTUALLY HAPPENING.
WE'RE
SINGING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES
RIGHT NOW WERE STUDENTS ARE
LOSING THEIR MINDS OVER SPEAKERS
WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH THEIR
POLITICS.
WE CANNOT HAVE THIS
HAPPEN.
WE CAN'T BE OVERLY
CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE FEELING
OFFENDED OR PEOPLE GETTING THEIR
FEELINGS HURT OR CRUSHED.
THIS
IS LIFE.
LIFE BASICALLY
PRESENTS YOU WITH A BUNCH OF
APPLES.
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE
SHELTERED FROM THE MEANIES FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH REALITY.
YES, BOYS AND GIRLS BOTH NEED
TO UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME
POINT IN YOUR LIFE YOU'RE
GOING TO FACE REJECTION.
WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A JOB, WHEN
YOU APPLY TO GO TO CERTAIN
SCHOOLS.
REJECTION IS JUST PART OF LIFE.
WE NEED TO ACCOMPANY KIDS UP A
LITTLE MORE.
AND LOOK, SOMETIMES IT'S A
LITTLE OVERSTATED BUT THERE ARE
SOME PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE THE
SAFE PLACES, ETC.
BUT IT
DEPENDS.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
SHOULDN'T BE SAFE SPACES.
THERE
SHOULD BE SPACE FOR YOU CAN
RELAX AND KNOW YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO BE HARASSED OR ASSAULTED.
IT'S NICE TO GO HOME AND HAVE
YOUR PARENTS TAKE CARE OF YOU OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR EVEN IN A
DORM TO FEEL LIKE A, THIS IS NOT
THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE GOING TO
DEBATE OR GET ATTACKED BUT THAT
IS NOT THE WHOLE WORLD.
THE
WHOLE WORLD IS FILLED WITH
PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE AND
REJECTION AND SURPRISES AND
CURVEBALLS IN TOUGH TIMES AND
YOU ARE GOING TO GET KNOCKED
DOWN.
THE ONLY QUESTION IS
WHETHER YOU GET BACK UP.
THAT IS
NOT GOOD AS A HALLMARK CARD IS
IN IS, THE WORLD IS FULL BATH.
THAT IS THE REALITY.
THE OTHER
DAY MY SEMINAL KID WAS AT A
SOCCER TOURNAMENT AND I WAS
WORRIED THAT THEY WERE ALL GOING
TO GET METALS BECAUSE THEY ARE
ALL SEVEN AND IT TURNS OUT THEY
WEREN'T AND ONLY THE CHAMPIONS
WERE GOING TO GET THE TROPHY AND
MY SON WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THE
TROPHY.
HE WANTED TO PLAY SO HARD AND
THEY GOT IT, NOT A BIG DEAL.
AND HE FINALLY TOOK A PICTURE
WITH THE TROPHY, THAT IS
HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND
THERE PLENTY OF TIMES WERE
HEAT IN WINTER I DIDN'T WIN, YOU
FIGHT HARDER NEXT TIME AND
THAT IS LIFE.
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT BUILDS
CHARACTER AND WILLPOWER.
I
DON'T KNOW.
I KNOW THAT I'M
CONSIDERED A MILLENNIAL BUT I
JUST GREW UP IN A DIFFERENT
HOUSEHOLD WHERE MY IMMIGRANT
PARENTS BASICALLY TOLD ME IF YOU
FAIL AT SOMETHING IT IS NOT
EVERYONE ELSE'S FAULT, IS
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
WORKING HARD ENOUGH, MAYBE YOU
NEED TO DO THIS OR DO THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.
IF I GOT REJECTED
BY ANYTHING, I DID BALLET
GROWING UP.
IF I DIDN'T GET THE
SOLO I WANTED, THEY WOULDN'T
GOING YELL AT THE DANCE
INSTRUCTOR ABOUT HOW I DIDN'T
GET THE SOLO.
THEY WOULD TELL
ME, YOU NEED TO WORK HARDER AND
PRACTICE MORE.
I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS CULTURE
THAT WE ARE SETTING UP
WHERE EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT EVERYONE
ELSE'S FEELINGS IS A BAD IDEA.
LAST TWO THINGS ON THIS.
THIS WHOLE IDEA, AND I'VE SEEN
OTHER LIBERALS HONESTLY TEACH,
THEY NEVER WANT TO SAY NO TO THE
KIDS BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS
NEGATIVE AND NOT THE RIGHT WAY
TO GO.
MY PARENTS AND OATMEAL
THE TIME.
YOU KNOW WHY QUESTION
WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY.
CAN I BUY
THAT?
NO DOUBT CAN WE GET A
BIKE?
NO DOCUMENTED TV QUESTION
NO DOUBT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE
MONEY AND THAT IS THE WORLD WE
LIVE IN AND THAT IS OKAY.
YOU
WORK HARD AND YOU GET IT.
I DO
WORK UNTIL I COULD PAPER MY OWN
BIKE AND COULD PAPER MY OWN
BLACK-AND-WHITE TV, THAT IS HOW
OLD I AM AND THEN FINALLY I'M
GETTING THOSE FROM WOMEN.
THE
HUNDREDS OF THOSE.
YOU KNOW
WHAT IS IT?
IT HELPS ME TO GET
BETTER AND BETTER SO YOU GO
ACROSS YOUR THAT A HIGH SCHOOL,
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS IS HE REALLY
SAID DOESN'T WORK THAT YOU GO UP
AND SAY CAN I GET IT IS AND THEY
SAY NO, THAT DOESN'T WORK AND
SLOWLY YOU GET BETTER AT IT YOU
FIGURE OUT HEY, HOW DO I MAKE
THIS PERSON HAPPY AND WANT TO GO
OUT WITH ME WESTERN MARK
AND IF YOU NEVER GET THAT YOU
JUST GET BIG GUESSES IT
DOES NOT HELP YOU.
