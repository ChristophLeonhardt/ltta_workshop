JUDGE JEANINE: JOINING ME BY PHONE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP. THANKS FOR GETTING BACK TO US. PRESIDENT TRUMP: HOW IS YOUR RECEPTION? THEY HAD A SECURE RECEPTION SITUATION. IS IT OKAY? JUDGE JEANINE: IT'S OKAY AND YOU ARE ON AIR. PRESIDENT TRUMP: GOOD, I LIKE THAT. WITH YOU I LIKE BEING ON AIR WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL RATINGS. JUDGE JEANINE: ASIDE FROM SOME OF THE PROTESTERS, IN WASHINGTON THERE IS AN EXCITEMENT. WE HAVE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION SO FAR. YOU HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISH. AND YOU ACCOMPLISHED IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I AM EXCITED. THE PROTESTERS ARE A VERY SMALL GROUP. I JUST LEFT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN KANSAS. IT'S AMAZING WHAT'S GOING IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE A GREAT NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, JEANINE, AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL. JUDGE JEANINE: I DO. MR. PRESIDENT, A LOT OF OTHER PRESIDENTS MIGHT HAVE PULLED THE PLUG. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO RECONNECT WITH YOU. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES WHERE YOU COULD HAVE SAID OKAY LET'S TRY SOMEBODY ELSE. AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TIME A PRESIDENT DID THAT. BUT YOU STOOD WITH KAVANAUGH DURING HIS DARKEST MOMENTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP: IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAIR TO HIM. HE'S A HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN. WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID WAS DISGRACEFUL. THINGS HAPPENED THAT CAME OUT OF THE WIND. THERE WAS NO CORROBORATION. THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY BRILLIANT MAN WHO WILL AND PHENOMENAL SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. IT WAS MY HONOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID YOU WILL NEVER GET ANYBODY LIKE THIS. THIS IS A VERY, VERY OUTSTANDING PERSON AND INDIVIDUAL WITH AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNFAIR. WHAT THEY DID TO HIM WAS DISGRACEFUL. YOU SAW THAT GROUP, WITH BLUMENTHAL WHO FALSIFIED HIS SERVICE IN VIETNAM, THE TERRIBLE MAYOR OF NEWARK, KNOWLEDGE WHERE, DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO IN MY OPINION LEAKED THE PAPERS. IT WAS TERRIBLE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. VERY UNFAIR. SO I DID STICK WITH HIM AND I AM VERY HAPPY I DID. JUDGE JEANINE: YOU HAVE AN UNCANNY INSTINCT. YOU HAVE A GUT SENSE OF THINGS. AND YOU WERE VERY DISCIPLINED AFTER CHRISTINE FORD CAME OUT AND THE LEFT WAS GOING WACKY. BUT THERE WAS ONE POINT WHERE YOU I HAVE ON THE IN A RALLY IN MISSISSIPPI JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. YOU WENT OFF SCRIPT AND MANY PEOPLE SAID YOU WERE EXTREMELY UNKIND TO CHRISTINE FORD. WHAT WAS IT THAT GOUT TO PIVOT FROM YOUR RESTRAINT ABOUT HER, AND TO FIGHT FOR KAVANAUGH AT THAT POINT? COUNTY RSH POUNTY RSH POINTY RSH POINT? RSH PRESIDENT TRUMP: THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING THAT WEREN'T TRUE AND A LOT OF THINGS LEFT UNSAID. I THOUGHT I HAD TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD. IT WAS UNFAIR TO THE JUDGE, AND NOW I CAN SAY JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. IT WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION. ONCE I DID THAT IT STARTED TO SAIL THROUGH. HE WAS TREATED VERY, VERY UNFAIRLY, JEANINE. JUDGE JEANINE: EVEN "THE WASHINGTON POST," EVEN "THE WASHINGTON POST" TOP OF THE FOLD TODAY TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU WENT OFF SCRIPT AND YOU WENT AFTER CHRISTINE FORD, SAYING NOTHING THAT WASN'T ALREADY TRUE, TALKING ABOUT HER MEMORY FAILURES REGARDING THE FUNDAMENTALS OF HER ASSAULT. THEY SAID IT WAS A TURNING POINT TO VICTORY. WHEN YOU DID THAT YOU TURBO CHARGED THE VICTORY WHEN HIS FATE WAS MOST OF IN DOUBT. THERE IS NO QUESTION WHAT YOU DID WAS INSTINCTIVE, GUTTURAL ^, YOU DID IT, AND YOU WON. PRESIDENT TRUMP: IT WAS A TURNING POINT AS "THE WASHINGTON POST" WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKINGLY SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY POSITIVE. I'M PROUD OF IT. WE HAVE A VERY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT, GREAT JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT FOR MANY YEARS. I FOUGHT HARD TO MAKE SURE HE GOT ON. YOU WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YOU WILL SEE HOW GREAT HE'LL BE AND HOW HE'LL BECOME. I HAVE NO DOUBT BY THE AT ALL. JUDGE JEANINE: SHOULD THERE BE CONSEQUENCES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO PROMOTED FALSEHOODS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAWYER AVENATTI, THE ALLEGATIONS HE WAS PROMOTING WHEN HE BRINGS OUT THIS ALLEGED VICTIM WERE SO PREPOSTEROUS THAT THEY DISSIPATED ON THEIR OWN. SHOULD THIS PERSON BE HELD FOR THE FALSEHOODS, NOT JUST IN TERMS OF GRIEVANCES WITH THE BAR ASSOCIATION, BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT. PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE MADE FALSE ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ME. IT'S A DISGRACE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE OUR LIBEL LAWS GET TOUGHENED UP. BUT HE MADE FALSE STATEMENT. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE HELD LIBEL. YOU CAN'T GO AROUND AND WHETHER IT'S MAKING UP STORIES OR MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT SUCH AN IMPORTANT POSITION, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU DESTROY SOMEBODY'S LIFE. THERE WERE MANY, MANY FALSE THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT A VERY FINE MAN THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED HIS FAMILY. IT ALL CAME TOGETHER IN THE END, AND PEOPLE REALIZE IT WAS FALSE ACCUSATIONS, FALSE STATEMENTS. IT WAS SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING, AND ACTUALLY VERY NICE TO SEE. HE SUFFERED, JEANINE. I WATCHED THAT VERY CLOSELY. HE SUFFERED FROM FALSE STATEMENTS MADE ABOUT HIM, THINGS THAT NEVER HAPPENED. JUDGE JEANINE: DID THE DEMOCRATS MAKE A TACTICAL MISTAKE THAT WORKED TO THE REPUBLICANS' ADVANTAGE, ESPECIALLY WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH AS A SACRIFICIAL LAMB WHO I BELIEVE THE TURNAROUND WAS YOU IN MISSISSIPPI. BUT DID THEY MAKE A TACTICAL MISTAKE AND IS THEIR ANGER GOING TO CARRY THEM TO THE MID-TERMS IN A POSITIVE WAY. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I THINK THEY OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND. THEY WERE DISHONEST WITH THE LEAK AND OTHER THINGS THEY DID. LOOK AT THE LAWYERS REPRESENTING CERTAIN PEOPLE. THEY ARE RIGHT OUT OF THE DEMOCRAT PLAYBOOK. THEY REPRESENTED OTHERS WHO ARE DEMOCRATS. HOW DID THEY END UP WITH ALL THESE LAWYERS WHO ARE ALWAYS THE SAME ONES? I WON'T EVEN GO INTO NAMES. I THINK THEY OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND. I CAN TELL YOU THE ENTHUSIASM AND LOVE AND THE FEELING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS HIGHER THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN IT. YOU SEE POLLS GOING UP LIKE ROCKET SHIPS. RACES THAT WILL BE WON ON MARGINS WHERE THE REPUBLICANS WOULDN'T HAVE WON. WE NEED MORE VOTES TO CUT TAXES AND DO THINGS THEY WILL NEVER DO. THEY ARE GOING TO OPEN BORDERS AND CRIME WILL POUR IN. WE WANT BORDERS WHERE YOU COME INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY. AND SO MANY THINGS. THE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE STRONGEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IT AND IT HAPPENED THE LAST TWO TO THREE WEEKS. JUDGE JEANINE: IF YOU ARE JOINING US, I'M JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO. WE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. CONTINUING WITH THE DISCUSSION, YOU SAID THAT MURKOWSKI WILL NEVER WE COVER FROM VOTING NO ON KAVANAUGH. THEN SHE KIND OF NEUTRALIZED IT BY SAYING SHE WAS KNEW MONTREALIZED WITH THE SENATOR WHOSE SHE WAS NEUTRALIZED WITH THE NOR WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS GETTING MARRIED. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I THOUGHT IT WAS A SAD VOTE AND DISGRACEFUL. I APPRECIATE THAT A DEMOCRAT, JOE MANCHIN VOTED IN FAVOR OF JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING. BUT THAT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THE PEOPLE OF ALASKA, I HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH THEM. WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH ANWAR, ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRILLING SITES IN THE WORLD. RONALD REAGAN AND BUSH TRIED TO GET APPROVED. I GOT IT APPROVED. IT MEANS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND I'M NOT EQUATING ONE THING WITH THE OTHER AT ALL. BUT I HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR ALASKA, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE HER VOTE. AND FRANKLY SO WERE OTHER REPUBLICANS. IT WAS A VERY SAD DAY I THINK FOR HER. I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN AS A SAD DAY FOR HER BECAUSE HE'LL BE A GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. JUDGE JEANINE: WITH RESPECT TO SUSAN COLLINS AND THE SPEECH SHE MADE ON THE SENATE FLOOR, SHE HAS BEEN RECEIVING KUDOS FROM EVERYONE. THEY THEY SAY SHE IS RECEIVING DEATH THREATS. I WILL SHOW SOME OF THE VIDEO OF PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO DISRUPT OUTSIDE THE SENATE FLOOR AS THEY VOTED TODAY. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS? WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION ARE UNITED STATES SENATORS GOING TO GET IN THIS ROUGH AND TUMBLE LEFT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE LOST ALL SENSE OF LAW AND ORDER? PRESIDENT TRUMP: WELL YOU RECEIVE THREATS ON BOTH SIDES. SUSAN COLLINS IS A STAR. WHAT SHE DID WAS INCREDIBLE. I SPOKE TO HER YESTERDAY. WHAT SHE SAID AND THE WAY SHE SAID IT WAS BRILLIANT. IT REALLY COVERED IT. SHE HAS FROM THE BEGINNING REALLY LIKED BRETT KAVANAUGH. SHE HAD RESPECT FOR HIS INCREDIBLE GENIUS. HIM AS A SCHOLAR. HIM AS A GREAT PERSON OF THE LAW. NOBODY KNOWS IT BETTER. AND SHE RESPECTED HIM RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. AND SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS RIGHT ON EVERY OTHER SUBJECT INCLUDING OUTSIDE INFLUENCES THAT CAME IN. IN THE END SHE WENT THROUGH PROBABLY AS CAREFULLY AS ANYBODY, HE WENT THROUGH EVERY PAPER, EVERY DOCUMENT, AND I THOUGHT HER STATEMENTS YESTERDAY WERE ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF HER. SHE IS MORE POPULAR NOW THAN SHE HAS EVER BEEN. SHE IS MORE POPULAR NOW AND SHE HAS EVER BEEN. JUDGE JEANINE: ONE OF THE THINGS SHE REFERENCED WAS THERE WAS DARK MONEY, DARK MONEY OPPOSING THIS KAVANAUGH NOMINATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE MEANT BY THAT? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I THINK I WOULD RATHER LET HER EXPLAIN IT. BUT IT'S SERIOUS THING GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO THIS NOMINATION. AND THE DEMOCRATS KNOW HE'S SO GOOD THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM THERE. THEY WOULD HAVE FOUGHT OTHERS ALSO. BUT THEY DID NOT WANT HIM THERE. AND HE'S CENTRAL CASTING. THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS BORN FOR THE POSITION. I HEARD HIS NAME 10 YEARS AGO THEY USED TO TALK ABOUT HE'LL SOME DAY BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. THAT WAS LONG BEFORE I THOUGHT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I USED TO HEAR HIS NAME AS SOMEBODY WHO SHOULD BE ON THE SUPREME COURT. AND THAT'S WHAT I DID. I PUT HIM ON THE SUPREME COURT. I THINK IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. JUDGE JEANINE: A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ARE SHARING IN THIS CELEBRATION. WHEN YOU SPOKE TO HIM, DO YOU THINK IT WAS BITTER SWEET FOR HIM? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I KNOW THIS. IT WAS GOING TO BE VERY EASY. I PICKED HIM ALSO FOR THIS REASON. I SAID THIS MAN IS SO GOOD IN HE WAY, ON A PERSONAL BASIS, INTELLECTUAL BASIS, SCHOLARLY BASIS, THE HIGHEST GRADE, FIRST IN HIS CLASS. I SAID THIS WILL BE AN EASY ONE. THEY FABRICATED STORIES ABOUT HIM TO LOOK AS BAD PASS POSSIBLE. THEY ARE FAB AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT. YOU CAN SAY I STUCK IT OUT. BUT HE STUCK IT OUT ALSO. WHAT THEY DID TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY WAS HORRIBLE. JUDGE JEANINE: IT'S A TOUGH THING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE LITTLE GIRLS. I WANT TO MOVE ON TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AT THE RALLY. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 6th BRANCH OF THE ARMED FORCES. THE SPACE FORCE. WHAT IS THE SPACE FORCE? PRESIDENT TRUMP: AS WE ADVANCE, SPACE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT FOR DEFENSE. THAT MEANS DEFENSE AND OFFENSE. IF IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE AIR FORCE OR ONE OF AIR FORCE OR ONE -F AIR FORCE OR ONE OR ONE OF OUR OTHER FORCES, IT WILL NEVER BE UP FRONT. IT NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITIES. SO MUCH OF OUR DEFENSE AND OFFENSE WILL BE RELATED TO SPACE. SO WE ARE SETTING UP A NEW BRANCH OF THE ARMED FORCES TAKING PLACE VERY RAPIDLY. EVERYBODY AGREES WITH IT. JUDGE JEANINE: IF MELANIA WHO WAS IN AFRICA TODAY, IN EGYPT IN GUYSA AT -YSA AT SA AT IN AT IN GT IN GIZA AT THE PYRAMIDS. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'M SO PROUD OF HER. TODAY SHE WAS AT THE PYRAMIDS. AND SHE IS COMING HOME. SHELL BE .HELL BE .SHLL BE .SHE' BE .SHE'LLE .SHE'LL BE HOME VERY EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. SHE IS A GREAT FIRST LADY. SHE IS REPRESENTING OUR COUNTRY VERY WELL. PEOPLE LOVE MELANIA AND I'M PROUD OF HER. JUDGE JEANINE: YOUR NUMBERS ARE GOING UP, BUT HER NUMBERS ARE EVEN HIGHER. SHE IS A CLASSY FIRST LADY. IT'S ALWAYS GREAT LOOK AT HER AND LISTENING TO HER. YOU HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT. I AM HOPING AS WE GO THROUGH THE MID-TERM THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE RESULTS OF THIS SUCCESSFUL I SUSPECT THE DEMOCRATIC ANGER WILL BE OUT THERE, TOO. LAST QUESTION, WHICH ONE WINS? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO DO VERY WELL. WE HAVE THESE TINY MAJORITIES. IF SOMEBODY CATCHES A COLD, WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO COME BACK. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL AS WE SPEAK. BUT I WANT TO GET IT ALL AT ONE TIME SO WE CAN HAVE IT DONE QUICKLY. BUT FOR THE MOST OF PART WE HAVE DONE ALMOST EVERYTHING. WE ARE BUILDING THE MILITARY. THIS IS THE WALL IS VERY SMALL BY COMPARISON, BUT WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH AND WE ARE HAPPY ABOUT IT. WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT'S MY HONOR TO DO THAT. I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. JUDGE JEANINE: WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING "JUSTICE" THIS EVENING. IT'S TIME YOU CELEBRATED A
