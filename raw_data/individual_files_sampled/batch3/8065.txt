Tucker: GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND STUDENTS AND ABOUT A TOTAL OF 10 PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES ENJOYED THE DAY OFF FOR CLBLDZ. COLUMBUS DAY. SOME WANT IT CALLED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DAY. COLUMBUS, OHIO, IS DITCHING COLUMBUS DAY AND CELEBRATING VETERANS DAY IN INSTEAD. THE AUTHOR OF "ERASING AMERICA" JOINS US TONIGHT. THIS IS PART OF A LARGER TREND YOU WRITE ABOUT IN YOUR BOOK WHICH I HOPE OUR VIEWERS READ. TELL US WHAT THAT TREND IS. WELL, THE TREND IS TO MAKE US ALL FEEL ASHAMED TO BE AMERICANS AND LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF THE AMERICAN STORY AND SAY THE FOUNDERS WAS BAD AND THE CONSTITUTION IS RACIST. WHAT BETTER PLACE TO START THAN WITH CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS? HE WAS PATIENT ZERO OF THE EUROPEAN INVASION OF AMERICA. Tucker: I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THAT? WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO THAT? WELL, THE POINT IS IF WE FEEL BAD ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND ABOUT THE PAST, THEY CAN REWRITE ANY FUTURE THEY WANT. PROGRESSIVES WANT TO TURN THE UNITED STATES INTO A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. IF YOU SAY EVERYTHING IN THE PAST IS BAD, THEY CAN COME UP WITH A FUTURE THAT FITS WHATEVER THEY WANT TO MAKE IT. Tucker: THEY ARE TELLING THE REST OF US YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST OUR ASSAULTS? OH, DEFINITELY. IT'S ABOUT SHAME AND BLAME. THE ASSAULT ON COLUMBUS. AS A BUCKEYE I AM SAID ABOUT COLUMBUS, OHIO, DITCHING THE HOLIDAY. I THINK THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CITY. Tucker: I AGREE TO INDIGENOUS CITIES. . OR VIRTUE-VILLE. Tucker: . OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON IN ACADEMIA FOR SOMETIME. IT SEEMS TO HAVE SPREAD TO COLUMBUS, OHIO, WHICH IS A GREAT TOWN FILLED WITH NORMAL PEOPLE. WELL, I THINK IT'S BEEN INSINUATED INTO THE AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR DECADES. STARTING IN THE 1970s, WE HAD REVISIONISM IN AMERICAN HISTORY BOOKS. WITH COLUMBUS, HE STARTS CHAPTER 1 IN THE REVISIONIST HISTORY OF AMERICA. PEOPLE SAY COLUMBUS IS A BAD GUY. Tucker: UNBELIEVABLE.
