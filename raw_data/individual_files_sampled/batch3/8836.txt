Neil: ALL RIGHT. EVERY YEAR IT'S APPLE'S BIG CONFERENCE THAT GOES ON FOR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. THE KICKOFF TODAY IS ABOUT TRYING TO CURE iPHONE ADDICTION. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH VESTED INTERESTS APPLE'S CREATOR WILL HAVE TO TRY TO WEAN YOU, MAYBE YOUR KIDS OFF OF THESE PHONES OR LIMIT THEIR TIME. BUT PSYCHO THERAPIST AND OFF OF DISCONNECTED, HOW TO RECONNECT OUR DIGITALLY DISTRACTED KIDS, TOM, EASIER SAID THAN DONE, RIGHT? IT IS. WE'RE COMPLETELY ENVELOPED AS A SOCIETY. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Neil: I HAVE TWO TEENAGE BOYS THAT ARE ADDICTED TO THIS. TO GET THEM OFF IS TOUGH. THE PROBLEM IS, WE GIVE THEM FREE REIGN. TAKE THE PHONE. LET IT GO TO SCHOOL WITH YOU. WE HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH, THIS IS AMBITIOUS. I UNDERSTAND. WE GET TO THE POINT THAT IF OUR CHILDREN WANT TO USE THE PHONE FOR SOME REASON, THEY COME ASK US. LIKE ICE CREAM OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR, THEY COME ASK US. Neil: REALLY? HAVE YOU TRIED THIS? I TRIED IT WITH MY OWN KIDS. Neil: WHAT DO THEY SAY? THEY DON'T LIKE IT. I DO THE BEST I CAN. Neil: WHEN YOU STARTED DOING IT, WHAT WAS THE REACTION? MY SON DIDN'T GET ONE UNTIL AFTER THE EIGHTH GRADE. THERE'S NO SOCIAL MEDIA. IT'S THIS PROBLEM ON OUR LAPS. NOW APPLE IS TRYING TO TELL US IT'S IT'S A GOOD P.R. MOVE THAT THEY'RE TRYING Neil: YOU BELIEVE THEY ARE INTERESTED NO, I DON'T. ANYBODY WATCHING CAN GO ON THEIR iPHONE, GO TO SETTLES, BATTERY AND YOU'LL SEE HOW MANY HOURS PER DAY OR WEEK THAT YOU SPEND. Neil: NOTHING NEW. YEAH. IF YOU HAVE AN iPHONE, I'LL SHOW YOU. Neil: WITH MY KIDS, IT'S 24 HOURS. SO I'M JUST WONDERING HOW YOU BALANCE IT OUT. IS THERE A WAY FOR APPLE TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS SO THAT WE FIND ALTERNATIVES? SOME SAY THERE'S SOFTWARE TO SHUT THE PHONE DOWN. THEY HAVE THAT. IT'S NOT REALLY AN APPLE THING. IT'S A HOME-TO-HOME FAMILY THINGS. PARENTS HAVE TO START THE KIDS CAN'T CONTROL THEMSELVES. THE IDEA OF WE WANT TO TEACH OUR KIDS HAVE TO HAVE CONTROL OVER IT. THEIR BRAIN IS NOT DEVELOPED THEM TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTROL IT. IT HAS TO COME FROM THE PARENTS. OFTENTIMES IS LIVING THE EXAMPLE OURSELVES. Neil: YEAH. SO THIS TECHNOLOGY, MORE ADVANCED YOU GET, THE MORE THESE GADGETS CAN DO, THE WORSE IT'S GOING TO GET, RIGHT? I BELIEVE SO, YEAH. RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT THE PRECIPICE OF A MAJOR PROBLEM AS A SOCIETY BECAUSE WHAT THIS STUFF IS DOING PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO US, HOW IT'S TEARING FAMILIES APARTY, SOCIAL RAMIFICATIONS AND SO FORTH. THE DEVELOPERS ARE CONTINUING TO POUR OUT NEW PRODUCTS EVERY WEEK PRACTICALLY. THEY HAVE ONE GOAL. THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP US GET OFF Neil: THE OTHER SIDE, IT MAKES OUR LIVES EASIER, SMOOTHER. DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. SIMON COWELL JUST REVEALED THAT HE GOT RID OF HIS PHONE. I WAS TIRED OF BEING CONTACTED. HE NEEDED PEACE OF MIND. Neil: BUT HE TEXTED THAT. HE DID. Neil: THANKS, TO THE AUTHOR,
