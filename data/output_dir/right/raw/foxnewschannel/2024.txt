GO OVER THE LIMIT HIMSELF AND

39
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:13,113
ALSO RECRUIT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE

CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY DINESH

48
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,458
D'SOUZA WOULD BE WANTING TO HAVE

>> JUST AS THE LAWYER HERE BUT I

55
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:39,706
WOULD SAY IT'S IMPORTANT THE LAW

56
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:40,407
IS APPLIED CONSISTENTLY HERE.

57
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:43,510
I CAN UNDERSTAND, THE CAMPAIGN

58
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,444
FINANCE LAWS ARE VERY CONFUSING

59
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:46,580
AND IF I'M REALLY HONEST I THINK

60
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,247
IT IS CONFUSING ENOUGH THAT

61
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:50,250
PERHAPS THE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE

62
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,488
IN CHARGE OF RESPONDING WHATEVER

63
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:55,088
IS NOT USED.

64
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,523
FOR THE SAKE OF CONSISTENCY YOU

65
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:58,325
JUST KNOW THAT IF THIS WERE

66
00:01:58,325 --> 00:01:59,927
ROSEANNE DONATING TO TRUMP

67
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,261

68
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,262

69
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:03,664
A LOT OF NOISE OUT ABOUT IT

70
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:04,731
THING WE SHOULD THROW THE BOOK

71
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:05,065
AT THEM.

72
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:05,799

73
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,301
SOUND BITE FOR YOU FROM

74
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,036
MICHELLE OBAMA AND GET YOUR

75
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:09,402
THOUGHTS.

76
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:11,138
LET'S PLAY IT.

77
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:13,740
>> IF WE AS WOMEN ARE STILL

78
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,946
SUSPICIOUS OF ONE ANOTHER.

79
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,548
IF WE STILL HAVE THIS CRAZY,

80
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:22,449
CRAZY BAR FOR EACH OTHER THAT WE

81
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,119
DON'T HAVE FOUR MEN, IF WE ARE

82
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:26,820
STILL DOING THAT TODAY, IF WE

83
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,090
ARE MORE COMFORTABLE -- IF WE

84
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,058
ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE

85
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:34,695
NOTION THAT A WOMAN COULD BE OUR

86
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:35,696
PRESIDENT COMPARED TO, WHAT?

87
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,497
>> Martha: THERE WE HAVE,

88
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:38,699
AGAIN, THE SAME SORT OF

89
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,433
ASSUMPTION THAT HILLARY CLINTON

90
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,235
MADE THAT ANY WOMAN WHO VOTED

91
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:45,872
FOR TRUMP BASICALLY REJECTED HER

92
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:48,342
AFFINITY FOR WOMEN OR FOR WOMEN

93
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:51,178
CANDIDATES OR SHE VOTED LIKE HER

94
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:52,346
DAD OR HER HUSBAND OR HER BOSS

95
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:54,381
TOLD HER TO LIKE WE HEARD FROM

96
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,450
HILLARY.

97
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,084
GINA.

98
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:58,885
>> I HAD A 50/50 CHANCE OF

99
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,887
COMING OUT BEING A WOMAN.

100
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,023
I DON'T CONSIDER IT AN

101
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,291
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

102
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,859
YOU CONTRAST THIS WITH OUR

103
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:06,560
BEAUTIFUL FIRST LADY NOW AND

104
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,495
THERE'S JUST NO COMPARISON.

105
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,197
THIS IS ALL ABOUT DIVISIVENESS

106
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:12,599
AND TO SAY THE WORDS SHE SAID

107
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,700
THAT FOR SOME REASON WE SHOULD

108
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,968
VOTE FOR WOMAN SIMPLY BECAUSE

109
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,304
SHE'S A WOMAN AND TO CONDESCEND

110
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:19,706
THE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR

111
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:21,775
TRUMP'S, ON ITS FACE, SEXIST.

112
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:24,911
SPEEONE >> SHE ACTUALLY DIDN'T

113
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:25,278
SAY THAT.

114
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:26,947
I AGREE WITH HALF OF YOUR POINT.

115
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,015
SHE DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD VOTE

116
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:29,916
FOR HER JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A

117
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,917
WOMAN.

118
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:31,685
>> SHE SAID IN HER PREVIOUS

119
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,754
SOUND BITE, SHE SAID I'M

120
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,022
CONCERNED ABOUT US AS WOMEN,

121
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,156
WHAT WE THINK ABOUT OURSELVES,

122
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:37,324
EACH OTHER, WHAT'S GOING ON IN

123
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:38,592
OUR HEADS THAT WE LET THAT

124
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:38,925
HAPPEN.

125
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,561
>> LET THAT HAPPEN IS ELECTING

126
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,096
SOMEONE TO HIS OFFICE WHO IS

127
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:44,064
ESPOUSING AND PROMOTING POLICIES

128
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,032
THAT DON'T HELP WOMEN AND ALSO

129
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:46,533
SOMEONE WHO TALKS ABOUT THE

130
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:51,138
WOMEN -- WE ALL REMEMBER

131
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:51,872
MRS. PEGGY, MRS. HOUSEKEEPING,

132
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:53,340
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ROSIE BEFORE.

133
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:01,014
THIS IS A MAN WHO DEMEANS WOMEN.

134
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:01,748
>> SHE WAS TALKING AT ALL WOMAN

135
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:02,282
WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP.

136
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:05,152
>> WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS

137
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:06,687
THAT SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW

138
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:08,355
WOMEN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO THIS

139
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:10,590
PERSON IS, HIS CHARACTER, HOW HE

140
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,492
TREATS WOMEN, EVEN HIS OWN WIFE.

141
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:14,928
>> SHE WAS SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE

142
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:15,696
VOTED FOR HILLARY SIMPLY BECAUSE

143
00:04:15,696 --> 00:00:00,000
SHE IS, THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.
