1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,590
NAFTA IS
BEING RENEGOTIATED

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,910
ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,589
THERE IS ONE PORTION IN
PARTICULAR THAT HAS TO DO WITH

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:37,440
JUNK FOOD AND LABELING OF JUNK
FOOD.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:01:00,789
>>OF COURSE IT DOES.

6
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,679
I KNOW PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON
CONSIDER ME RADICAL LEFT

7
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,900
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE ON TO ME
BEING A MODERATE.

8
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,010
DO I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE?

9
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,010
YES.

10
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,750
BUT OF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT
IS IN THE TRADE DEAL.

11
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,530
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO
TARIFFS.

12
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,910
THE ALUMINUM AND STEEL
TARRIFS TRUMP DID ARE GOING TO

13
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,270
BACKFIRE AND HURT OUR ECONOMY.

14
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,610
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD
HANDOFF CARTE BLANCHE ALL

15
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,620
OUR NEGOTIATIONS TO
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.

16
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,020
THEY DON'T HAVE OUR BEST
INTEREST AND LOT MIND.

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,800
BY LAW THEY MUST HAVE THEIR OWN
BEST INTEREST IN MIND.

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,450
THEY ARE THERE TO MAXIMIZE
PROFITS IN THE SO-CALLED FREE

19
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,450
TRADE DEALS ARE IN REALITY JUST
TO LET CORPORATIONS WRITE

20
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,450
THE RULES.

21
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,500
AND OF COURSE THEY SAY WE ARE
DOING AN IMPORTANT TRADE

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,530
DEAL, MEXICO AND CANADA MIGHT
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY

23
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,980
DON'T LABEL HER FOOD.

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,409
WHO IS ACTUALLY WRITING THE LAW?

25
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,909
THE CORPORATIONS.

26
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,230
>> LIKE 100% EXPLICITLY.

27
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,750
THIS PREEMPTS THE OTHER
COUNTRIES.

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,180
THE COUNTRIES THAT WERE DOING
THESE PACKS WITH, IT KEEPS

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,000
THEM FROM MAKING THEIR OWN LAWS
WHICH IF SOMEONE DID THAT

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,410
TO US YOU KNOW THEY WOULD BE
SUPER UPSET ABOUT.

31
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,370
>>WHAT THIS DOES AND THAT IS
WHY CONSERVATIVES SHOULD BE

32
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,840
FURIOUS ABOUT IT.

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,280
NOW WHAT IS HE DOING?

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,750
NAFTA
HAND OVER CORPORATE POWER.

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,870
WHY ARE CONSERVATIVES
FURIOUS ABOUT IT?

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,040
BECAUSE IT TAKES AWAY OUR
SOVEREIGNTY.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,030
IT'S AS IF AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE
NOT IN CHARGE.

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,030
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE
IN CHARGE OF OUR LAWS TO

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,490
MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS,
SOMETIMES AT A COST TO ALL OF

40
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,490
US.

41
00:02:45,490 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THAT IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH
THESE TRADE DEALS.
