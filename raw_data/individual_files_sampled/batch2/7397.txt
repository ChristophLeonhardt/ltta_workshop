some Republican lawmakers and one prominent Fox News host have been badgering Attorney General Jeff Sessions in regard to this supposed uranium one scandal involving Hillary Clinton and they want an investigation and it's interesting because now the Attorney General or I should say the Justice Department has released a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chair Robert Goodlatte in regard to a potential investigation a review for a potential investigation into Hillary Clinton and the uranium one deal now just to give you a quick context into the uranium one deal the hill had published a report based on a book that was written by a Breitbart editor-at-large that accused hillary clinton of being part of this pay to play scheme where she granted the allegations was that she granted russia access to uranium in the united states and every bit of investigation to this so far has proven that this is inaccurate and I'll get into that later I kind of disagree with okay well the evidence shows that it is completely inaccurate and is not backed up by facts whatsoever there were nine federal agencies that approved the deal there's no evidence whatsoever that Hillary Clinton was even aware of it she didn't even have veto power or unilateral decision making power when it came to that particular issue the uranium that Russia was able to obtain through that deal is not allowed to leave the United States they are able to use it here in the United States and Russia has more uranium than the United States ever will have and so yeah they already have weapons like this notion that oh the world has become more unsafe because Hillary Clinton signed on to this uranium one deal it's just inaccurate the the facts don't bear that out whatsoever well look no okay so if you say that you know I acknowledge everything you say except for one important distinction which is the Clinton Foundation did get a lot of money from these same people who helped this deal go through and Bill Clinton did go and get paid personally hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russia right around the same time does that create at least an appearance of a conflict of interest yes did Hillary Clinton have potentially have a role to play did she unilaterally make this issue no Ana's absolutely right she did not unilaterally make the decision do we have any evidence that she wrote a memo saying hey I got paid make sure this deal goes through no there's no evidence of that right but you have her Foundation and her husband getting paid by these guys at the same time that she is part of an approval process that happens to go through it's a terrible terrible idea to go get paid at the same time as this deal is going through because even if you didn't have anything to do with it it certainly looks like that right so there is evidence publicly that they took money and then Hillary Clinton helped to approve the deal so I think that if you wanted it investigated back then I think it would have been a perfectly legitimate investigation and you might have found further evidence to investigate it now years later after they're no longer in power and because Donald Trump has specifically asked for a political investigation is a completely different story and completely outrageous so I just I just want to be clear about one thing before we move forward because the burden of proof that we use for for Trump and potential Russian collusion is a very high burden of proof and I believe that's fair but when it comes to Hillary Clinton seems like we don't utilize the same burden of proof she did not personally approve anything there's no evidence that she personally approved anything there isn't even any evidence that she was aware of the deal now I agree with you that that money and that corruption is a bad look and it's a bad look on a number of issues and I think that's ultimately what led to her losing the election she's so damn corrupt but again to say that she personally played a role in that decision-making we don't have the evidence for that and I didn't say that why well you said played a role in the decision no no this this State Department absolutely positively played a role that this now it might be that the Secretary of State was clueless and did not was not involved in that decision or it might be that she was completely involved no one knows I mean so if I would I have investigated at the time god damn right I would have investigated it I would have said wait your husband just took hundreds of thousand dollars from the guys who would like to make this deal happen and put it in his pocket in other words your pocket and then they gave money to your foundation on top Wow you're part of the process that approves this deal no I'd like to investigate that and find out if you had a role to play okay but this is six seven years later they're not in office they lost so this is nothing but a political scheme by Trump to try to do diversion tactics so this you don't have to worry about the content of that long-ago deal so it's obvious Trump says in public it's the saddest thing that I can't interfere with the Justice Department he in public just ten days ago said that Jeff Sessions in the Justice Department it's very discouraging that they're not going after Hillary Clinton so if you think that it's problematic that Hillary Clinton might have might have been involved in that deal I agree with you but then you should be way more worried that Donald Trump is clearly saying do a political retribution and I want to interfere with the Justice Department I'm saying it in public with Hillary Clinton you don't have enough evidence with Trump he gives you the evidence he says do a political investigation of Hillary Clinton because all right there's a special counsel against me so I want a special counsel against her yeah yeah that's it yeah I want a distraction strategy and here here it is so and look it's it drives me absolutely insane Hillary's not the president okay I don't care about Hillary Hillary is the most irrelevant person the only time Hillary is relevant is when she's trying to play a role in US politics again but right now she is completely irrelevant you're the President of the United States you were accused of collusion with Russia and in my opinion more importantly having some shady financial dealings with Russia that could be playing a role in your policymaking decisions that could actually undermine our democracy and the best interests of the American people that matters too way more than some deal that Hillary Clinton may or may not have known about from years ago okay regarding uranium that never left the United States alright so let's talk about what Jeff Sessions is doing the Attorney General and the Justice Department yes it's part of the executive branch they are not supposed to be influenced by the president okay but it appears that he is not only being influenced by the president he's being influenced by you know Robert Goodlatte again the House Judiciary Committee chair they want an investigation and then now more importantly Fox News host Jeanine Pirro Pyrrha whatever-her-name-is ranting and raving about this uranium one deal on Fox News because hey let's do whatever we can to distract from the fact that we have a crooked person as the president of the United States apparently Jeanine Pirro had met with Trump personally and and urged this investigation to happen if you are unclear of what P Rose tone is take a look at this video Obama in the Clinton sold us out our uranium and with it the security of our nation follow me they lied to us they said there was nothing to worry about that the sale of 20% of America's uranium to our enemy Russia wasn't really a problem Jeff Sessions needs to immediately release the informant from the non-disclosure agreement number two Andrew McCabe needs to be fired as number two in the FBI and number three Robert Muller instead of heading an investigation into determining whether Donald Trump colluded with Russia should be the target of an investigation for his role in covering up the extortion scheme that allowed Russia to access America's uranium you wrote a letter to Jeff Sessions and rod Rosenstein and I'm furious with with the Rosenstein I mean this guy employed smaller when he knows that Muller was on the uranium one deal he knows Muller's friends with Comey Rosenstein was on the Iranian one prosecution the underlying case and they're dancing with the devil right now I'm not even talking about the criminality and money to the Clintons and their so-called charitable foundation that accompany the sale of our uranium to Russia Hillary should not get a free pass because she lost an election her reign was one of bold brazen in-your-face pay-to-play corruption it's time to stop this psychopath why are they dragging their feet why are they not demanding that Muller pull back what are they afraid of Attorney General Jeff Sessions must open a new federal criminal investigation into Hillary Rodham Clinton and panel a grand jury immediately and void the false Clinton immunity deals easily done since each one has been violated was like nails to a chalkboard man how the mighty have fallen now we have the President of the United States of America at office that people used to respect getting orders from this two-bit clown she was in the Oval Office inside the White House tellin Trump to do this investigation that that that circus clown I'm tell you what is going on okay and she goes time to stop this psychopath I assume that she's not talking about herself but she should be yeah time to stop Hillary Clinton no that's we're past that time you already stopped her in 2016 so what do you mean stop her stop her from doing what she's walking around in the woods this has nothing new with Hillary Clinton one it's a distraction number two as she said over and over there but we have to get Robert Mueller out because he was kind of involved in this thing you don't know what he was involved or not involved in in other words you want to get Robert Miller out because he's investigating Donald Trump this is an obvious obstruction of justice play it's you're doing it right in front of everybody I think I think the person who looks weakest and the most pathetic is Attorney General Jeff Sessions especially considering the verbal beating that he received by Trump because he recused himself in after you know the some of these revelations regarding Russia and the meetings that he had with kiss lyac so now in response to all of this Jeff sessions has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate the lawmakers request for investigations into a number of matters related to Hillary Clinton the Clinton Foundation the uranium one sale and former FBI director James Comey zz leaks about his conversations with President Trump now to be clear he has not launched an investigation he is saying that he has directed federal prosecutors to evaluate whether or not an investigation can move forward and based on the lack of evidence in regard to this uranium one deal and you know the lack of evidence reinforcing these conspiracy theories about it it's unlikely that the investigation is gonna happen they don't have the evidence to move forward with an investigation mark my words you will see that play out the way I just said well I hope you're right but so two things about it I'll tell you who's definitely guilty and who the jury's out on the Republicans in Congress everyone said well there'll be a Jeff session Jeff Flake and a and a bob corker that comes out and it seems to hold Trump accountable no no it's just words but the Republicans in Congress just asked the Justice Department to launch a political strike back move and completely taint our Justice Department and not actually seek justice but turn it into a political witch-hunt that so that in the case of Trump there's actually evidence and and they're doing they're collecting that evidence in the case of Hillary they're almost admitting yeah why we're trying to do a witch on we're trying to get someone who's not relevant anymore because we care about political strike back so the Republicans and Congress are the worst the jury's in on that they've specifically requested this now as far as sessions of the Justice Department that jury is out this is them saying okay we will see if we will do that investigation so don't conclude yet that session is as dirty and it's definitely going to do it if they do do the investigation and sessions does not recuse himself either one of those things both of those things terrible and then the jury will be in on sessions but if they look at it and go there's nothing to investigate well then okay then they did the right thing so we'll see help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network /join
