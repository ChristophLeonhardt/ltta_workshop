>> Martha: DEVELOPING
TONIGHT HE IS FROM A COUNTY
THAT HAS ONLY TWO STOP
LIGHTS AND HE WAS THE FIRST
NFL PLAYER EVER FROM HIS
HOMETOWN.
NOW EX-NFL AND FORMER
MICHIGAN STATE FOOTBALL STAR
IS IN THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.
THIS ME TOO TARGET SAYS HE
IS INNOCENT.
HE HAS JUST FILED A LAWSUIT
AGAINST HIS COLLEGE, THE
FORMER TEXAN'S WIDE RECEIVER
WAS CUT FROM THE TEAM TWO
DAYS ARE A THE DETROIT FREE
PRESS BROKE THIS STORY.
HE WAS NEVER CHARGED WITH
ANY CRIME.
HE IS HERE EXCLUSIVELY FOR
THE FIRST TIME ON TELEVISION
TO TELL HIS SIDE OF THE
STORY IN MOMENTS.
BUT, FIRST, TRACE GALLAGHER
GIVES US THE BACK STORY.
TRACE?
>> MARTHA, BOTH SIDES AGREE
THAT ON MARCH 17, 2015 THE
WOMAN IN THIS CASE INVITED
KEITH MUMPHREY BACK TO HER
DORM ROOM THERE ARE PICTURES
THAT AT LEAST THE ATMOSPHERE
WAS FLIRTATIOUS.
THE WOMAN CLAIMS SHE WAS
DRUNK AND UNABLE TO GIVE
CONSENT.
HE SAYS SHE WAS NOT
INTOXICATED AND SURVEILLANCE
VIDEO SHOWS AT THE TIME SHE
WAS WALKING WITH A, QUOTE:
STEADY GATE AND HAD NO
TROUBLE KEEPING HER BALANCE.
KEITH CLAIMS THE WOMAN
OPPOSED HIM USING A CONDOM
AND THEY DID NOT HAVE SEX.
THE WOMAN CLAIMS SHE WAS
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND FILED
A CLAIM WITH CAMPUS POLICE
THE NEXT DAY.
NOW, REMEMBER, MITCH BEGAN
STATE FOLLOWS THE SO-CALLED
DEAR COLLEAGUE GUIDELINES
ISSUED DURING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
SO INSTEAD OF USING THE
LEGAL GUILT STANDARD OF
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT,
THE UNIVERSITY THRESHOLD IS
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.
AND UNDER THE DEAR COLLEAGUE
POLICY, THE ACCUSED IS NOT
ALLOWED TO QUESTION THE
ACCUSER.
AND YET, DESPITE THAT AFTER
MONTHS OF INVESTIGATING THE
UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT
MUMPHRYEY FOUND HE DID NOT
VIOLATE POLICY.
EVEN THE PROSECUTOR DECIDED
NOT TO FILE CHARGES CITING A
LACK OF EVIDENCE AND
COOPERATION BY THE ACCUSER.
UNLIKE A COURT OF LAW WHERE
A NOT GUILTY VERDICT CANNOT
BE RETRIED, TITLE 9
INVESTIGATIONS DO ALLOW
DOUBLE JEOPARDY.
SO THE WOMAN APPEALS
MUMPHREY'S AQUUTTLE AND
MICHIGAN STATE REOPENS THE
CASE.
HE IS NOW PLAYING FOR THE
HOUSTON TEXANS AND THE
NOTIFICATION FROM THE SCHOOL
IS SENT TO AN OLD EMAIL
ACCOUNT.
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE CASE IS
BACK OPEN AND DOES NOT OFFER
A DEFENSE.
IN MARCH OF 2017, THE
UNIVERSITY FINDS HIM
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT.
HE IS THEN CUT BY THE
TEXANS, CANNOT GET A TRY OUT
WITH ANY OTHER TEAM AND
BECAUSE IS HE BANNED FROM
MICHIGAN STATE, HE CAN'T
FINISH HIS GRADUATE DEGREE.
HE HAS NOW FILED A LAWSUIT
AGAINST MICHIGAN STATE,
ALLEGING THE UNIVERSITY HAS
LEFT HIM WITH NO VIALABLE
JOB PROSPECTS, AMONG OTHER
THINGS.
WE REACHED OUT TO MSU FOR A
COMMENT.
SO FAR NO RESPONSE.
MARTHA.
>> Martha: TRACE, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
HERE NOW FORMER MICHIGAN
STATE AND EX-NFL PLAYER
CHRIS MUMPHREY.
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THE
TOUGH QUESTION FIRST.
DID YOU SEXUALLY ASSAULT
THIS WOMAN?
>> NO, MA'AM.
>> Martha: WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT?
>> SHE INVITED ME OVER TO
HER ROOM.
I ACTUALLY MET HER THROUGH
TINDER.
SHE INVITED ME OVER TO HER
ROOM.
SENT ME A FEW PICTURES.
SHE TOLD ME WANTED ME TO
COME OVER WHEN HER ROOMMATES
LEAVE.
I CAME OVER.
ROOMMATES LEFT.
IT WAS ME AND HER THERE AS
SOON AS I GOT IN THERE SHE
STARTED UNDRESSING ME.
SHE BASICALLY MADE IT KNOWN,
YOU KNOW, WHAT SHE WANTED TO
DO.
SO FAST FORWARD A LITTLE
BIT, WE GOT TO A SITUATION
AND THE SITUATION WAS ABOUT
THE CONDOM.
I TOLD HER I DID NOT HAVE
SEX WITHOUT A CONDOM.
SO THAT'S WHEN SHE FLIPPED.
EVERYTHING JUST WENT SOUTH.
SO I BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,
TOLD HER LIKE HEY, IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO LEAVE.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
I BASICALLY SAID I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO LEAVE.
I'M BLACK AND YOU ARE WHITE.
I TOLD HER THAT.
AND I LEFT.
AND THAT WAS THE END OF
THAT.
>> Martha: SO YOU NEVER HAD
SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH THIS
WOMAN?
>> NO, MA'AM.
I NEVER DID.
NO, MA'AM.
>> Martha: IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU SAY ONE OF YOUR SIBLINGS
HAD A BABY AT A YOUNG AGE
AND THAT'S ALWAYS YOUR
POLICY IN TERMS OF BIRTH
CONTROL?
>> YES.
I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS.
SO I MEAN, I'M NOT GOING TO
HAVE ANY KIDS UNTIL I'M
MARRIED.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN
REASONS.
>> Martha: SO YOU THINK THAT
ALL OF THIS IS BEHIND YOU
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL FOUND YOU
NOT GUILTY.
THE PROSECUTOR DROPPED THE
CHARGES.
AFTER THEY LOOKED AT IT AND
SAID YOU KNOW, THERE IS
NOTHING HERE.
WE ARE NOT MOVING FORWARD.
DID YOU GO OFF TO BEGIN YOUR
LIFE AND YOUR DREAM AS A
PLAYER FOR THE HOUSTON
TEXANS.
AND SUDDENLY YOU GO BACK TO
PLAY IN A GOLF TOURNAMENT AT
MICHIGAN STATE AND SUDDENLY
SOMEONE COMES UP TO YOU AND
SAYS YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE
PROPERTY NOW SHE APPEALED
YOUR CASE AND NOW WE DECIDED
YOU ARE GUILTY?
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?
>> I WAS HURT.
MY FEELINGS WERE CRUSHED.
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU
THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?
BECAUSE THE STORY COMES OUT
IN THE DETROIT FREE PRESS
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THEY CALL YOU INTO THE
OFFICE OF THE TEXANS?
>> YOU KNOW, BASICALLY, THEY
TELL ME THAT, YOU KNOW, BAD
PRESS, AND WE HAVE ZERO
TOLERANCE WITH THIS.
>> Martha: SO ANDREW
MILTONBURG, DOES HE HAVE A
CASE?
CAN HE TURN HIS LIFE AROUND?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK THE NFL SHOULD
WELCOME HIM BACK AND GIVE
HIM AN OPPORTUNITY.
HE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A
VICTIM OF A TERRIBLE
INJUSTICE.
TREMENDOUS HARDSHIP AND SUCH
TERRIFIC ODDS IN HIS LIFE TO
MAKE IT TO THE PINNACLE OF
HIS DREAMS.
ALL TO HAVE IT RIPPED AWAY
YEARS AFTER HE LEFT THE
SCHOOL FOR ALLEGATIONS HE
WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
PREVIOUSLY.
>> Martha: KEITH, DO YOU
THINK RACE PLAYS A ROLE IN
ANY PART OF THIS?
>> I WOULD SAY TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT, YES.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN YOU
LOOK AT IT, I'M BLACK AND
SHE IS WHITE.
I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE
NEVER HAPPENED.
I FEEL LIKE IT HURT -- IT
HURTS.
IT HURTS.
>> Martha: I CAN IMAGINE.
YOUR LIFE WAS DERAILED AND.
ANDREW, WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN
IN THIS CASE.
SHE HAS NOT COME FORWARD AND
TALKED ABOUT IT.
>> SHE HAS CLAIMED SOME SORT
OF TRAUMA.
WHAT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
SIGHT OF IS I THINK IF YOU
READ THIS ENTIRE NARRATIVE,
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MICHIGAN
STATE, AFTER YEARS OF
IGNORING TREMENDOUS
PROBLEMS.
>> Martha: THE SCHOOL LARRY
NASSAR WORKED AT.
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT
MESS.
>> WITH LARRY NASSAR, IN THE
MIDST OF THAT TURNS AROUND
AND WE BELIEVE MAKES KEITH
MUMPHERY THE POSTER CHILD
FOR HOW OLD THEY ARE NOW
GOING TO GO AFTER THIS
ISSUE.
>> Martha: THAT WOULD BE
UNFORTUNATE IF THAT'S THE
CASE.
INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU.
AND PLEASE KEEP US POSTED,
KEITH, WE WISH YOU LUCK.
WE KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO
GET YOUR LIFE BACK ON TRACK
AND YOU WOULD LOVE TO PLAY
FOR THE NFL.
YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT TO BE
A ROLE MODEL FOR THE KIDS IN
YOUR TOWN.
YOU GREW UP IN A VERY, VERY
RURAL TOWN IN GEORGIA AND
EVERYBODY THERE LOOKS UP TO
YOU AND WE WOULD LOVE TO
FOLLOW THIS CASE AND WE WILL
SEE WHERE IT GOES.
