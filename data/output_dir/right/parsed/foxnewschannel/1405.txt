WANT THIS MORE THAN THE UNITED
STATES.
TRUMP HAS THE UPPER HAND DEANLT
KRATZ HAVE NO HAND.
HERE TO REACT FORMER WHITE HOUSE
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR ANTHONY
SCARAMUCCI AND COREY
LEWANDOWSKI, NOW PART OF THE
VP'S POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE.
THE GREAT AMERICA COMMITTEE.
DO YOU GUYS GET ALONG.
DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING WILL BE
OKAY?
>> WE GOT FIRED.
A SELECT GROUP.
JESSE: YOU GOT FIRED, THEN THEY
BRING IN MAN FOR THE  *.
MAN -- BRING IN
MANAFORT.
>> WE ARE FIRED BUT LOYAL.
JESSE: A VERY SMALL GROUP,
HOPEFULLY GETTING SMALLER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY
BRILLIANT COMMENTARY.
>> THE LEFT WILL NEVER GIVE THIS
PRESIDENT THE CREDIT HE
DESERVES.
FIRST HE WASN'T GOING TO BE
PREPARED FOR THE MEETING.
NOW HE PERSONALLY NEGOTIATED THE
RELEASE MUCH THREE AMERICAN
HOSTAGES, HE GETS NO CREDIT FOR
THAT.
HE'S MOVING TOWARDS THE
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN
PENINSULA AND HE NEVER GETS
CREDIT FOR THAT.
THEY SAY HE'LL NEVER BE PREPARED
FOR THIS MEETING.
JESSE: WHY DO YOU THINK
DEMOCRATS SIDE WITH PEOPLE LIKE
KIM JONG-UN.
DON'T THEY SEE THIS IS NOT SMART
POLITICS?
>> THEY ARE SO SCARED OF THE
PRESIDENT.
HE'S NOT A POLITICIAN IN THE
CLASSIC SENSE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE SOUND
BITES, THEY ARE OUT OF THE SAME
PLAYBOOK.
THE PRESIDENT IS OPERATING OUT
OF A DIFFERENT PLAYBOOK.
IT'S A BUSINESSMAN'S PLAYBOOK.
THEY ARE SO FEARFUL THAT HE'LL
WIN WITH HIS NEGOTIATING STYLE
AND IT WILL CAUSE THE MAYOR WHAT
PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY ARE
ALREADY STARTING TO DO, WHY DO
WE NEED THESE GUYS.
JESSE: IF GOOD THINGS HAPPEN FOR
AMERICA AND DONALD TRUMP, BAD
THINGS HAPPEN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
THAT'S HOW THEY SEE IT.
THEY CAN'T ALLOW THE PRESIDENT
TO HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY
SUCCESS.
>> THEY HATE THIS PRESIDENT MORE
THAN THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.
BUT IT'S SO TRUE.
30 YEARS OF FAILED FOREIGN
POLICY.
IT FAILED AND IT FAILED AND IT
FAILED.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS JOHN KERRY
FAILED.
DONALD TRUMP CAME IN AND SAID I
AM GOING DO IT DIFFERENTLY.
NOW WE ARE SEEING SUCCESS IN
NORTH KOREA FOR THE FIRST TIME.
JESSE: LET ME GET YOUR REACTION
TO JAMES COMEY.
SPYGATE HAS BLOWN INTO THE
ATMOSPHERE.
>> AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT'S
MADE UP.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S GETTING
THAT FROM.
>> DO YOU FIND THAT TO BE
POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE THAT THERE
WAS A SPY INSERTED INTO HIS
CAMPAIGN BY AN INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY?
>> I DON'T FIND IT POSSIBLE AND
I KNOW IT NOT TO BE TRUE.
JESSE: MAYBE JAMES CLAPPER HAD
DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS.
LET'S HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
>> WAS THE FBI SPYING ON TRUMP'S
CAMPAIGN.
>> NO, THEY WERE NOT.
THEY WERE SPYING ON A TERM I
DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE, WON'T
RUSSIANS WERE DOING.
WERE THE RUSSIANS TRYING GAIN
ACCESS AND LEVERAGE AND
INFLUENCE.
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.
>> WHY DOESN'T HE LIKE THAT.
HE SHOULD BE HAPPY.
EACH SHOULD BE.
JESSE: WHO DO YOU BELIEVE, THE
LIAR OR THE LEAKER?
>> WAIT COMES DOWN TO IS JAMES
COMEY LIED BEFORE CONGRESS SO
MANY TIMES.
HIS DEPUTY ANDREW McCABE LIED
TO THE FBI ON THREE DIFFERENT
OCCASIONS.
CLAPPER AND BRENNAN PROBABLY
PERPETUATED THE WORST CRIME IN
POLITICAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
HISTORY.
NOW THEY ARE SCURRYING RATS.
THEY ARE ALL POINTING THE
FINGERS AT EACH OTHER.
THEY HAVE MANY BAD DAYS IN FRONT
OF THEM.
EVERY TIME THEY GO ON TELEVISION
THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR STORIES
STRAIGHT.
JESSE: YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
STORIES TOGETHER IF
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO BE
ASKING YOU QUESTIONS.
>> HE COULD HAVE GONE IN WHEN HE
WAS A CANDIDATE AND SAID WE ARE
WORRIED ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND
WE ARE GOING TO PUT PEOPLE IN
PLACE TO PICK UP RUSSIAN
INTELLIGENCE.
THE PRESIDENT IS A TOTAL PATRIOT
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE WITH
IT.
THEY WERE FEARFUL HE WAS GOING
TO WIN, SO THEY DID ITA IN A
WERE
-RE
--E
--DID IT IN A SEREPTITOUS WAY.
>> THEY TOOK $5 MILLION OUT OF
THEIR CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST, PAID
AN.
DID THEY ALSO DO THAT WITH A
CAMPAIGN THAT PAID $5 MILLION TO
GO TO RUSSIA?
WE KNOW THE ANSWER NOISE.
THIS WAS THEIR INSURANCE POLICY
AGAINST A TRUMP SUCCESS.
JESSE: YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON
DEALING WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES
WHO DONATE MILLIONS TO HER
FOUNDATION.
I WOULD SAY THERE IS MORE
FOREIGN INFLUENCE INTO THE
CLINTON CAMPAIGN FROM CHINA,
MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES, FROM
THE RUSSIANS THAN THERE WAS FROM
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
>> THE NEXT MOVE WILL BE TO
COMPLETELY PROTECT THEM.
GOD FORBID IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO THEM, THERE ARE TWO BIG
DOMINOES THAT WILL KNOCK
EVERYBODY OUT.
JESSE: ALSO ANSWERING QUESTIONS,
THE NFL FINALLY HAS A POLICY
ABOUT KNEELING.
THE FANS DIDN'T LIKE THE
DISRESPECT.
TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT.
CHANGE IN POLICY.
IF THEY DO KNEEL, NOT ON THE
FIELD.
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.
BRIAN KILMEADE CAUGHT UP WITH
THE PRESIDENT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: YOU HAVE TO
STAND PROUDLY FOR "THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM" OR YOU SHOULDN'T BE
PLAYING, YOU SHOULDN'T THEREBY,
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE
COUNTRY.
JESSE: THAT FREAKED EVERYBODY
OUT.
>> THERE ARE RULES FOR EVERY
ORGANIZATION THAT PEOPLE WORK
FOR.
ONE OF THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.
STAND UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE "THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM."
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS
EVEN A CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RESPECT THE
FLAG THAT MEN HAVE DIED FOR.
DON'T PLAY A SILLY GAME WHERE
YOU MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO PLAY THAT
GAME, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
WILLING TO TAKE YOUR SPOT.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY PEOPLE
WALKED AWAY FROM THE NFL AND THE
RATINGS WENT DOWN AND THAT
SCARED ALL OF THEM.
BUT THEY ARE UP AGAINST IT WITH
THE PLAYERS' UNION.
TO ME I THINK THEY MADE THE
RIGHT DECISION.
I THINK THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TO
PROGRESS PEACE AND SOCIAL
JUSTICE.
THAT IS A GAME OF ENTERTAINMENT
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T
LIKE THEY ARE DOING.
JESSE: ONE OF THE COACHES WHO
DISAGREES WITH YOU HAD THIS TO
SAY ON THE NEW POLICY.
>> BASICALLY TRYING TO USE THE
ANTHEM, NATIONALISM, AIRING
PEOPLE IT'S IDIOTIC.
I AM PROUD TO BE IN THE LEAGUE,
BUT UNDERSTAND FATISM IN AMERICA
IS ABOUT FREE SPEECH AND
PROTESTING.
OUR PRESIDENT DECIDED TO MAKE IT
ABOUT THAT.
THE NFL FOLLOWED SUIT.
PANDERED TO THEIR FAN BASE.
JESSE: HE'S WRONG IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
WHEN YOU ARE AT YOUR EMPLOYER'S
PLACE OF WORK, HE'S PAYING YOU
TO PLAY FOOTBALL, YOU HAVE TO DO
WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO.
>> THE NBA SIGNED INTO THEIR
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO STAND FOR
"THE NATIONAL ANTHEM."
JESSE: THEY ALL STAND THERE.
SO WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
>> IT'S SIGNED CONTRACTUALLY
INTO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
AGREEMENT.
>> YOU PAY A GAME, YOU MAKE A
LOT OF MONEY IT'S AN
ENTERTAINMENT THING.
YOU STAND UP, SHOW RESPECT FOR
THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN WHICH WE
LIVE.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STAND FOR
THE ANTHEM.
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
GOOD LUCK MAKING THAT MONEY IN
ROMANIA.
JESSE: POLICE BRUTALITY AND
RACISM IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN
THIS COUNTRY.
AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS OTHER
AVENUES.
>> MOHAMMED ALI SAID IT WAS A
WHITE MAN'S WAR AN LEFT BOXING
TO MAKE THAT PROTEST.
I AM NOT SAYING PEOPLE SHOULD DO
THAT, I'M JUST SAYING LOOK AT
POWER AND COURAGE IT TOOK TO DO
THAT 50 YEARS AGO.
