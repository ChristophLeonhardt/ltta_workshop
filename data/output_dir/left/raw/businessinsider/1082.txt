those of us who think bacon is a health

food sugar content is surprisingly high

<font color="#E5E5E5">though we you're always keeping in mind</font>

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,990
I'm always keeping in mind when I'm

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,210
doing this work is if I think that

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,369
obesity and diabetes are caused by sugar

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,700
and white flour which I primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> sugar</font>

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then white flowers also problematic</font>

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,960
which i do then how do you explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> French for instance who clearly</font>

baguette sorry constant theme in French

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,670
life and pastries and croissants and but

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,890
as it turns out the sugar content<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,550
white bread in the United States white

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,109
bread can be as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve percent</font>

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,420
sugar where the sugar content<font color="#E5E5E5"> European</font>

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,129
white bread tends to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two to</font>

three percent so that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,590
surprising fact for me the French<font color="#CCCCCC"> shade</font>

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,640
remarkably little sugar they were always

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 50 to 100 years behind us and</font>

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,119
sugar consumption so with Southeast Asia

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,130
is about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred years behind us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,009
amount of refined grains and starches

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,810
but they didn't have obesity and

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,490
diabetes when you look you find out that

33
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're consuming very little sugar a</font>
