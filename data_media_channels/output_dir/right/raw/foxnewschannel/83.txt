1
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:12,346

3
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:14,048
FOR OUTGOING UNITED NATIONS

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:14,882
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY, MANY

5
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:15,749
EXPERTS OFFERING OPINIONS ON

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,686
WHO WE SHOULD CHOOSE.

7
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:19,420
ACCORDING TO AUTHOR AND

8
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:20,321
PUBLISHER CONRAD BLACK, THE TOP

9
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:21,188
CHOICES SITTING HERE WITH ME

10
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,455
NOW.

11
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:22,489
IN A RECENT ARTICLE, HE WROTE I

12
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,824
SUGGEST NEST YOUR SEMESTER

13
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:24,591
SHOULD BE ANN COULTER.

14
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:25,793
HER POLITICAL VIEWS UNLIKE

15
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:26,827
AMBASSADOR HALEY HAVE LONG BEEN

16
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:34,802
SUPPORTIVE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

17
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:35,769
SHE'S BEEN VERY ACCOMPLISHED

18
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,537
MANY YEARS.ACCUSTOMED TO

19
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:39,606
BEING VASTLY OUTNUMBERED BY

20
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:40,541
OPPONENTS OF HER UNAPOLOGETIC

21
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:41,842
CONSERVATIVE VIEWS AND WOULD

22
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:42,576
NOT BE PHASED IN THE SLIGHTEST

23
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:44,678
BY THE OPPOSITION OF 192 OTHER

24
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:55,456
COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS

25
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:56,957
, ANN COULTER IF NOMINATED

26
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:57,491
WOULD YOU SERVE?

27
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,225
>> OF COURSE, CONRAD BLACK IS A

28
00:00:58,226 --> 00:00:59,193
VERY SERIOUS INTELLECTUAL AND

29
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:00,160
WE SHOULD TAKE ANY SUGGESTION

30
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:00,861
HE MAKES SERIOUSLY.

31
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:01,562
OF COURSE I WOULD!

32
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:02,429
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO STEP ASIDE

33
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,831
FOR MY CHOICE WHICH IS, THE

34
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:09,603
PRESIDENTS DAUGHTER, IVANKA

35
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:10,037
TRUMP.

36
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:10,637
FOR ONE THING, IT GETS

37
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,305
RELATIVES OUT OF THE WHITE

38
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:11,739
HOUSE.

39
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,573
ANOTHER THING, I THINK IT'S

40
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:13,774
INSULTING TO THE UN.

41
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:14,241
I'M SENTIMENTAL.

42
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:20,948
ONE THIRD THING, JARED ANDY

43
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:20,981
ONE THIRD THING, JARED --DY

44
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:23,350
ONE THIRD THING, JARED -- JARED

45
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:28,555
ANDY

46
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:28,589
--DY

47
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:28,822
-- Y

48
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,024
>> WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?

49
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:30,691
>> I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT

50
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:33,227
HERE IS THAT NOT ONLY IS RICK

51
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,261
SHOWING WHAT AN AMBASSADOR CAN

52
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:39,199
DO, WE HAVE NOT KNOWN REALLY

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,933
WHAT INVESTORS ARE CAPABLE OF

54
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,036
BECAUSE HIS WORK IN GERMANY HAS

55
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:43,237
BEEN EXTRAORDINARY.

56
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:44,538
HE'S BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THE

57
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,239
PRESIDENT FROM THE BEGINNING.

58
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
HE OF COURSE, HAS EXTENSIVE

59
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:47,107
EXPERIENCE AT THE UN WITH

60
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,677
MULTIPLE U.S. AMBASSADORS TO

61
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,379
THE UN.

62
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,347
AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY,

63
00:01:53,348 --> 00:01:54,615
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THIS

64
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,050
IS A GUY THAT AMERICA ALREADY

65
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:56,450
LIKES.

66
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,418
WE KNOW HE UNDERSTANDS THE

67
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,485
PRESIDENTS AGENDA AND IS ABLE

68
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,153
TO MOVE IT FORWARD.

69
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,955
AND I BELIEVE HE IS UNDER SOME

70
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:02,523
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.

71
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:07,161
ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS IS THAT IT

72
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:08,395
HAS TO BE A WOMAN.

73
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,095
AND LOOK, I WANT WOMEN TO DO

74
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:09,797
WELL, OBVIOUSLY AS WELL.

75
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:10,631
I SPENT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE

76
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,533
WORKING FOR THAT.

77
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:13,867
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS SO MANY

78
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,870
TALENTED WOMEN THAT REALLY WE

79
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,105
CAN GET RID OF THE QUOTA NOTION

80
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,874
AND NATURALLY, WOMEN ALREADY IN

81
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:21,642
GOOD CONDITIONS, WILL BE IN

82
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:26,246
MORE GOOD POSITIONS AND IT

83
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,081
MEANS THAT OF COURSE, THE BEST

84
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:27,948
PERSON FOR THE JOB SHOULD GET

85
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:28,215
IT.

86
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,484
IN THIS CASE IT IS RICK.

87
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,921
>> I LIKE THE IDEA.

88
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:34,521
I JUST WANT TO SEE THE

89
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,557
CONFIRMATION HEARING!

90
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:37,558
I WANT TO SEE YOU SITTING THERE

91
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,792
AT THE DESK AND THEN YOU SEE

92
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:43,230
LIKE CORY BOOKER AND KAMALA

93
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:43,897
HARRIS ASKING YOU QUESTIONS.

94
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,866
JUST WAITING FOR THE ANSWERS.

95
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:50,904
STEVE: AND WHAT ABOUT MENENDEZ?

96
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:56,910
I WOULD -- THAT WOULD LIGHT IT

97
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:57,177
UP.

98
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:57,678
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

99
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,512
>> WILL BE SO FUN TO SEE THEIR

100
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:58,946
HEADS EXPLODE.

101
00:02:58,947 --> 00:02:59,980
IT REALLY WOULD BECAUSE COULD

102
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,215
YOU SEE CORY BOOKER READING

103
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:02,049
PASSAGES FROM ONE OF YOUR

104
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,349
BOOKS?

105
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,050
HOW WOULD THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

106
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,552
>> I HAVE SEEN CHUCK SCHUMER

107
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:10,924
ALREADY HAS REJECTED A HISPANIC

108
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,226
NOMINEE, THE GREAT MIGUEL

109
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:12,559
ESTRADA.

110
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,065
DEMOCRATS REJECTED A HISPANIC

111
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,366
NOMINEE BECAUSE HE WAS THANKING

112
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:19,833
ONE OF MY BOOKS.

113
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:23,604
>> MY GOSH!

114
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:24,471
>> I WANT HIM TO START READING

115
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,440
FROM CLUELESS.

116
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:26,840
[LAUGHTER]

117
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:40,954
THERE IS A REFERENCE THAT IS

118
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:41,421
RELEVANT.

119
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,022
>> I THINK IT'S A JOKE.

120
00:03:42,023 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYTHING WE WOULD TRY TO GET
