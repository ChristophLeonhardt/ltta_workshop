These are the members of NATO,
a military alliance formed in 1949
to protect European countries
against the Soviet Union.
“Only a strong
defensive alliance
could deter them
from further adventures.”
NATO now includes
29 countries,
including three that are
former Soviet states.
“Estonia …
Latvia …
Lituania.”
The Soviet Union may have collapsed,
but Russia is still trying
to wield influence
over the region and undermine
nations who get in its way.
How?
By trying to destabilize
America and Europe,
and damage their relationship.
The goal: to weaken alliances
so Russia can more freely
pursue its interests.
From cybermeddling
to mind games,
here’s how the country and
its leader, Vladimir Putin,
excel at geostrategic trolling.
One tactic?
The method:
Invade a foreign nation,
reject the outcry
and hold the territory.
Exhibit A:
Just as Ukraine was embarking
on a pro-Western course 
and possibly joining NATO,
Russian-backed rebels
seized Crimea.
They’ve been there ever since.
And Russia even
built a massive bridge
to connect to the area.
Method:
Stoke instability,
claim innocence.
Exhibit A:
“Little green men.”
Russia claimed the
insignia-free forces
who took over strategic
locations in Crimea
were not the Russian
military, but instead
were “separatists.”
Putin eventually admitted
that the men were his troops,
once Crimea was under control.
Method:
Posture the military
in provocative ways.
Exhibit A:
Deploying next generation
nuclear-capable missiles
at NATO’s doorstep.
Method:
Undermine elections,
trigger power outages —
“Ukraine.”
— leak emails.
Exhibit A:
Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.
These were Russia-linked
hacking entities accused
of attacking
America’s elections.
The U.S. has indicted 12
Russian military officials
for the interference.
Use soft power
to hide ugly truths.
Method:
Host international
sporting events
to show you’re a
good global citizen.
Exhibit A: the World Cup,
which allows Russia
to gloss over charges
of human rights abuses
and international isolation.
Method:
Find a useful megaphone
for your message.
Exhibit A: Donald Trump.
The U.S. president
has been reluctant
to criticize Putin
for his country’s actions.
“And I might even end up
having a good relationship,
but they’re going:
‘President Putin
is K.G.B,’ and —
you know what,
Putin‘s fine.”
That’s made it
easier for Russia
to achieve its aim of
weakening the world order.
