but Jesse that's why I wanted to bring you on I feel like you can bring a great perspective that is completely missing from political news shows which is it is all politics local or is all politics national you know the national media that they're gonna focus on national issues and unfortunately it's turned into the WWF and increased ratings and trying to get everybody's attention and everything is really erratic and everybody's it's high stress levels and they're getting ratings and they're getting viewers because of this high stress so that's getting into local people's television but that doesn't mean that local people in rural areas and middle-class areas really care too much about national issues it may grab their attention but they're certainly not voting on it it's not affecting their school taxes it's not affecting their roads that are in front of their house but affecting you know property disputes it's not affecting what I believe that the things that will drive middle-class people to the polls on both local as well as national issues you know it's a you've got two different things here you've got the Democratic machine in the inner cities where it doesn't matter about national politics they do exactly what they're told they're gonna vote Democrat then you've got everywhere else in America which I would say is predominantly the Republican Party right that's where everybody else who voted for Trump outside of the major cities they're more focused about school taxes school issues getting jobs and the things that matter most of them and I would argue are more local issues than at generations and the the national news media and the big political shows they never talk about it because you're right it's like the WWF and and it's probably for I think a lot of people and a lot of small towns it's like the WWF also in that you can talk about it you talk about it just like you watched a ballgame or you watched a reality TV show or you watched some event it's fun it's gossip it's entertaining but it isn't your property taxes it isn't your school taxes it just does not affect your life you know look at the storm the storm was literally a 10-day extravaganza pipe it up and as much people you know as many people scared as possible and it does serve a valuable purpose you know you're learning people to the potential danger but they literally will drag out any piece of energetic or stressful information out as long as they possibly can and it does get attention at those bring people together and I think speaker Gingrich was correct and people are following this information but I certainly don't think it is what genuinely drives people to the polls and will determine elections on that point I think we should point out rush limbaugh was absolutely right and vindicated here he predicted a week ago that hurricane Irma was being hyped for ratings when he was forced to evacuate they raked him over the coals they called him a hypocrite they said it was awful and then it turns out he was absolutely 100% right so another another chalk for Rush Limbaugh now Jesse as a mayor what are your priorities you're a mayor of a local government small town what are your priorities I assume it's Melania Trump wearing the sneakers you know Ted Cruz some staffer tweeted this out because it's interesting people are gonna see the link they're gonna click on it and the drive viewers are gonna get people in my community they don't care about that stuff you mentioned Ted Cruz they probably half of them don't even know who he is any ran for president they just don't care you know they care about the lake they care about the infrastructure in our community they care about our schools and roads you know those are the issues they care about when you hear someone like Donald Trump talking about those issues talking about infrastructure and jobs you know that's those are local issues that affect people locally they're not talking about women atthe room you can use or which gender you think you are talking about things that the matter jobs the infrastructure right those are those are inner-city issues where the Democrats I would argue are you know focused on those things and and they're following the Democratic agenda for the most part and I was out here in rural America and class in the Republican Party we care about the real things but you know the jobs what kind of a future our kids are gonna have in the school districts and things like that thank you for validating a perspective I've had now for I guess six months or nine months
