1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,120
KEN STARR IS ON TV AND HE HAS
THE GOAL TO TALK ABOUT A

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,100
PROSECUTOR WHO MIGHT BE
OVERREACHING.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,290
THIS IS OF COURSE IN REFERENCE
TO MUELLER WHO IS A SPECIAL

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,269
COUNSELOR AS KEN STARR WAS
INVESTIGATING WHITEWATER WHICH

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,880
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER WAS A REAL
ESTATE DEAL AND HE IS SAYING HOW

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
MUELLER MIGHT BE OVERREACHING
GOING INTO CHUMS FINANCES, BUT

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,590
IF THE FINANCES ARE CONNECTED TO
RUSSIA, THAT WOULD BE THE HEART

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,210
OF THE INVESTIGATION BUT THAT'S
OKAY, LET'S HEAR THEM OUT.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,490
NOW THE QUESTION IS, WITH
THEIR COLLUSION WITH THE

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,930
TRUMP CAMPAIGN?

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,640
SO THE INVESTIGATION GOES
BEYOND THE RUSSIAN MANDATE AND

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,430
LET'S JUST SAY, LET'S LOOK INTO
THE FINANCING OF TRUMP TOWER BUT

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,690
THERE IS NO RUSSIAN CONNECTION
TO IT, BUT THE ARGUMENT AS

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,560
I SEE IT IS THERE THAT THE
INVESTIGATION IS GONE TOO FAR.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,010
WAIT A MINUTE, THEY FIND OUT
THAT HE HAS FINANCIAL DEALS

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,880
WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THAT
THAT ALLOWED HIM TO FINANCE

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,950
TRUMP TOWER, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR A
STORY WE COVERED ON THE

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,670
YOUNG TURKS, FOUND OUT THAT ONE
THIRD OF THE APARTMENTS IN

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,930
TRUMP TOWER WHEN IT FIRST GOT
UP, AND THIS IS A TIME WHEN

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,980
DONALD TRUMP WAS IN THE
MIDDLE OF A BANKRUPTCY IN A

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,930
MASSIVE TROUBLE, WERE BOUGHT BY
THE RUSSIANS.

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,110
IF THEY'RE JUST INNOCENT
RUSSIAN CITIZENS THAT JUST

23
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,010
COINCIDENTALLY HAPPENED TO BUY
ONE THIRD OF THE APARTMENTS

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,840
IN TRUMP TOWER, OKAY, THAT IT IS
NOT RELATED, BUT IF IT HAS

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,670
TO DO WITH MONEY LAUNDERING
THAN IT MIGHT BE ENORMOUSLY

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,240
RELATED AND BY THE WAY, YOU
DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU INVESTIGATE

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
THAT YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT IT
WAS MONEY LAUNDERING.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,380
YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT IT WAS
SOME SORT OF A LEGAL DEAL

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,380
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,210
I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO TRUMP.

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,700
YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE TO FIND
OUT IF IT IS RIGHT ISN'T

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,100
AND THERE'S ONLY WAY TO DO THAT.

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,720
TO DO THIS INVESTIGATION BY THE
WAY, IT ISN'T A MANDATE

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,180
THAT ROB ROSENSTEIN THE DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT PUT

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,610
MUELLER IN CASE THE FIRST ONE
SAID IN HIS LETTER THAT

36
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,710
MUELLER COULD INVESTIGATE ANY
MATTERS THAT AROSE OR MAY

37
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,410
ARISE DIRECTLY FROM THE
INVESTIGATION.

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,900
KEN STARR, WHO LEGENDARILY WENT
ABOVE HIS MANDATE AND WENT INTO

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,020
BILL CLINTON'S SEX LIFE FOR
REASONS NO ONE UNDERSTANDS TO

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,990
THIS DAY IS GOING TO SAY HEY, BE
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW FAR YOU

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,980
GO WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

42
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,760
HOW HE COMES ON TV AND HAS THE
TEMERITY TO SAY THIS, IT IS

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,010
AMAZING AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND
EXCEPT REPUBLICANS JUST

44
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,790
DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF
APOSTROPHE.

45
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,480
THEY HAVE NO ISSUE WITH AT ALL
BUT I WANT YOU TO WATCH AND

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,230
THEN I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A
SERIES OF PICTURES AFTERWARD

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,550
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
WHAT CANCER ACTUALLY DID.

48
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,980
THE MANDATE THAT BOB MUELLER
RECEIVED HAS SOME BROAD LANGUAGE

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,730
INCLUDING RELATED TO TYPE
LANGUAGE WHICH TENDS TO OPEN THE

50
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,400
DOOR BUT THERE ARE CHECKS AND
BALANCES, THE PRESIDENT HAS

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,220
SAID HERE IS THE REDLINE.

52
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,880
I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF
THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT WAS

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,820
WAS THEIR COLLUSION TO THE
EXTENT THAT YOU WERE MOVING

54
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,610
BEHIND COLLUSION WITH RUSSIAN
OPERATIVES OR INTERESTS OR

55
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,319
THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND INTO
THAT, WHICH DOESN'T SEEM TO

56
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,440
HAVE A DIRECT TITLE RUSSIA, THEN
THESE QUESTIONS ARE IN FACT

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,660
RAISED AND IT BECOMES A LITTLE
GLOBAL AS WE SAY QUESTION

58
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,770
THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SQUAWK
ABOUT AND DISAGREE ABOUT IT.

59
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,330
I DON'T THINK IT IS CLEAR ONE
WAY OR THE OTHER, BUT I DO THINK

60
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,930
IT IS CERTAINLY A SERIOUS MATTER
WHEN A SPECIAL COUNSEL IS

61
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,489
ACCUSED, AND I WAS ACCUSED OF
THAT, OF EXCEEDING HIS OR

62
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,489
HER AUTHORITY.

63
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,239
THAT IS A SERIOUS MATTER
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT

64
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,090
INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS
OUT ON A FISHING EXPEDITION.

65
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,690
A FISHING EXPEDITION?

66
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,370
CAN START TALKING ABOUT THAT.

67
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,910
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS HE
SAID EARLIER.

68
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,959
THE PRESIDENT IS DRAWING A RED
LEONARD INVESTIGATING HIS

69
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,959
FINANCES.

70
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,379
THE PRESIDENT IS THE SUBJECT OF
THE INVESTIGATION.

71
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,800
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL CARE
WITH THE SUBJECT OF HIS

72
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,470
INVESTIGATION DRAWS THE REDLINE.

73
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,849
IT'S LIKE A BANK ROBBER SAYING
LOOK, YOU CAN LOOK INTO ME

74
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,760
RUB MUGGING PEOPLE ARE
ASSAULTING THEM, BUT I'M

75
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,150
GOING TO DRAW THE REDLINE ON YOU
INVESTIGATING THE ROBBING BANKS.

76
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,010
AND YOUR OPINION IS RELEVANT
WHY?

77
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,600
YOU DON'T GET TO SET THE
PARAMETERS OF WHAT PEOPLE

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,700
INVESTIGATE YOU INVESTIGATE.

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,769
THE IDEA THAT LET'S SAY ROBERT
MUELLER FINDS THAT TRUMP IS

80
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,729
CLEARLY OBVIOUSLY FLAGRANTLY
IN VIOLATION OF MONEY

81
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,879
LAUNDERING SCHEMES.

82
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,360
WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,319
GOVERNMENTAL THAT IN THE
GARBAGE, BARRY, DON'T GIVE

84
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,889
IT TO THE PRESS OR AUTHORITIES.

85
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,660
IT IS BEYOND MY MANDATE.

86
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,590
I INCLUDED EVIDENCE, HE
SAYS IN THE EMAIL, THAT'S OKAY.

87
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,059
BUT DONíT INVESTIGATE
THAT BECAUSE IT CAME UP IN

88
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,509
YOUR INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIA.

89
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,479
IF THAT IS THE CASE, LET HIM TO
THE INVESTIGATION SO WE CAN

90
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,479
ALL FIND OUT.

91
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,520
AND BY THE WAY, TRUMP DENIES
THE INCIDENT AND ASSESS HIS

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,090
CLAIMS AND HIS SUPPORTERS
CAN START GOING OUT THERE

93
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,339
DEFENDING AND THEN WE WILL FIND
THAT OUT.

94
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,409
THERE WILL BE NO SMOKING GUN.

95
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:58,430
YOU DON'T KNOW SO I THINK I DO
HIS JOB.

96
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,520
NOW FINALLY COMING TO THE
FISHING EXPEDITION.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,569
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, CAN START?

98
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,759
YOU GUYS REMEMBER WHAT KEN
STARR WAS ACTUALLY PICKED TO

99
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,759
INVESTIGATE?

100
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,759
YOU MIGHT NOT.

101
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,559
YOU HEAR THE
WORD WHITEWATER EVERY ONCE

102
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,559
IN A WHILE.

103
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,710
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT IS?

104
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,770
IT IS REAL ESTATE IN ARKANSAS.

105
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,210
WE HAVE A PICTURE OF IT FOR YOU.

106
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,440
THIS IS WHAT HE WAS SET TO
INVESTIGATE.

107
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,879
DID BILL CLINTON HAVE SOME SORT
OF ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL OR

108
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,539
UNTOWARD DEAL RELATING TO
WHITEWATER REAL ESTATE IN

109
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,539
ARKANSAS?

110
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,259
YOU KNOW WHAT THE INVESTIGATION
SHOWED?

111
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,599
NO, NOT AT ALL.

112
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:35,599
NOT GUILTY.

113
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,229
SO I GUESS CAN WAS DONE BECAUSE
HE IS NOT A FISHING EXPEDITION.

114
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,710
NO, IT WASN'T DONE.

115
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,569
HE WAS LIKE I DON'T CARE.

116
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:44,869
THAT WAS MY REAL ESTATE THAT
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO

117
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:45,909
INVESTIGATE INSTEAD?

118
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,909
THIS.

119
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:49,059
WAIT, GO THE NEXT PICTURE.

120
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:53,849
SHOW ME HOW WHITEWATER REAL
ESTATE LED TO MONICA

121
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,979
LEWINSKY'S DRESS?

122
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:56,979
FISHING EXPEDITION.

123
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:59,979
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FISHING
EXPEDITION?

124
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,669
YOU RAN THE MOST LEGENDARY
FISHING EXPEDITION IN

125
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:04,819
AMERICAN HISTORY.

126
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,470
ANY OF THE GOLDA, TV AGO NO,
LET'S MAKE SURE MUELLER IS

127
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,849
INVESTIGATING MANY POSSIBLE
CRIMES ARE THERE CERTAIN

128
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:15,069
CRIMES HE SHOULD NOT
INVESTIGATE.

129
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,199
THAT WILL BE EXCEEDING YOUR
AUTHORITY AND OFF-LIMITS.

130
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,990
YOU DO FIND THAT.

131
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,289
AND COME ON HERE AND TELL US
THAT PROSECUTORS SHOULDN'T

132
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,999
GO ON FISHING EXPEDITIONS.

133
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:31,619
THEY JUST ARE NOT CONNECTED TO
THE TRUTH OR REALITY OR FAX

134
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,619
AT ALL.

135
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:35,300
THEY DON'T CARE, SO JUST GO AND
BRAZENLY SAY STUFF LIKE

136
00:06:35,300 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS ON TV.
