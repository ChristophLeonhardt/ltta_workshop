1
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:05,093
OWN PEOPLE FIRST.

2
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:09,164
>> CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR

3
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:10,198
JOINING US.

4
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:10,832
HILLARY CLINTON RECENTLY

5
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:12,234
CONDEMNED THE POLICIES WE WERE

6
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:14,836
TALKING ABOUT AS HORRIFIC WHICH

7
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:17,172
IS STILL SURELY COMING AS NEWS.

8
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:18,774
IN 2003 THIS IS WHAT

9
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:21,009
HILLARY CLINTON SAID ABOUT THE

10
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:21,777
CRISIS ON THE BORDER.

11
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:25,013
WATCH THIS.

12
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:28,016
>> I AM ADAMANTLY AGAINST

13
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,351
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE

14
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:32,186
HAVE TO STOP EMPLOYING ILLEGAL

15
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:32,587
IMMIGRANTS.

16
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:34,356
>> NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE

17
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:35,657
THEN OF COURSE EXCEPT FOR HER

18
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:36,992
PARTY'S CALCULATIONS THAT I

19
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:38,193
COULD ONLY WIN BY IMPORTING A

20
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:39,995
NEW CLASS OF VOTERS, WHICH THEY

21
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:42,230
ARE TRYING YOUR BEST TO DO.

22
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,299
MARK STEYN IS AN AUTHOR AND A

23
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,835
COLUMNIST AND HE JOINS US

24
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:47,169
TONIGHT.

25
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:48,170
MARK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

26
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,572
PREPARED TO TAKE A LECTURE ON A

27
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,774
BIBLE FROM HILLARY CLINTON OR

28
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:55,377
ABRUPT ON MIKE BARBARA BOXER OR

29
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:59,214
THE REST, BUT DO YOU FEEL

30
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:00,615
EDIFIED BY THIS?

31
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:03,351
>> IT'S INTERESTING, I THINK

32
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:06,855
BEING RATHER SELECTIVE IN THIS

33
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:08,857
IN THE FOCAL FERVOR.

34
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:16,832
IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE LEFT, AND

35
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:19,968
THAT'S WHAT IMMIGRATION IS.

36
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,603
IT'S PUBLIC POLICY.

37
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:24,773
HILLARY AND OF THE REST OF THE

38
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:28,043
LEFT, AND I REGRET NOW AN ENTIRE

39
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:30,645
PHALANX OF FIRST LADIES HAS

40
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:32,514
DECIDED THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

41
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,182
SENTIMENTAL IS A STUB PUBLIC

42
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:34,816
POLICY.

43
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,853
THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT IS

44
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,387
SUPPOSEDLY ON ORANGE ALERT.

45
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:41,623
OVER HALF OF THE ILLEGAL ALIENS

46
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:45,060
PRESENT BROKE INTO A COUNTRY ON

47
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,495
ORANGE ALERT.

48
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:51,800
THAT MEANS THEY COME HERE SINCE

49
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,236
9-11.

50
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:55,704
THE SECURITY DEMANDS TO KNOW THE

51
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:58,673
CONSISTENCY OF THAT PUMPKIN PIE

52
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:01,743
IF THEY ARE FLYING HOME TO

53
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:02,477
THANKSGIVING FROM NEW YORK TO

54
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,746
CLEVELAND, BUT THE REST OF THE

55
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:05,780
WORLD IS ENTITLED TO WALK ACROSS

56
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,681
THE RIO GRANDE IF THEY HAPPEN TO

57
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:10,651
HAVE A LITTLE MUPPET INTEL WITH

58
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:11,553
THEM.

59
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:14,556
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

60
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:18,560
IF I MAKE A DOMESTIC FLIGHT,

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,797
THEIR BORDERS ARE OPEN AND I MAY

62
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,966
BE THE HARSHEST PERSON HERE

63
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:27,235
SPEAKING TONIGHT BECAUSE I KNOW

64
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:30,338
AS A LEGAL IMMIGRANT HOW

65
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:37,612
HEARTLESS AND RUTHLESS ILLEGAL

66
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:39,180
IMMIGRATION POLICY, AND THESE

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,615
DEMOCRATS, LAURA BUSH NEVER HAS

68
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,751
A WORD TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

69
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,451
>> Tucker: WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

70
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,120
IF YOU SHOWED UP TO THE AIRPORT

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,054
WITHOUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND

72
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:48,123
SAID IT, I HAVE A MORAL RIGHT TO

73
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,191
GET ON THIS PLANE INTO A RACIST

74
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,727
FOR NOT LETTING ME ON.

75
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,796
WHAT THAT WORK?

76
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:58,967
>> WE ARE BIFURCATING INTO A

77
00:02:58,967 --> 00:02:59,668
SOCIETY WHERE THE LAW-ABIDING

78
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:10,979
ARE SUBJECT TO EVERMORE WHILE

79
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:11,613
THE LAWLESS HAVE SOMEHOW

80
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:14,749
VENERATED AND FETISH US.

81
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:15,417
>> Tucker: BUT YOU ACTUALLY

82
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:26,695
ARE FOREIGN BOARD       BORN.

83
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:33,034
AND I WAS CROSSING DERBY LINE,

84
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:36,171
AND RATHER THEY THREATEN TO CALL

85
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,807
EYES AND HAVE MY DAUGHTER

86
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:39,174
DEPORTED.

87
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:40,508
THEN SHE'D BE IN CANADA AND HE

88
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:41,977
WOULD BE STUCK HERE IN AMERICA,

89
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:43,778
AND I SAID I WOULD BE MUCH OF A

90
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:45,580
FATHER IF I DID THAT BECAUSE I

91
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,681
WILL TELL YOU 10 MINUTES AFTER

92
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,218
YOU DEPORT HER, I WILL BRING HER

93
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:52,020
BACK TO WHATEVER COUNTRY YOU

94
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,154
DEPORT HER TOO.

95
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:53,855
BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND BEING

96
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,591
IN AMERICA IS THAT I HAVE TO BE

97
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,993
SEPARATED FROM MY CHILDREN, THEN

98
00:03:57,993 --> 00:04:00,161
I PASSED.

99
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,063
AND I'M SURPRISED, FRANKLY, AND

100
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:03,298
ALL OF THESE HARDWORKING PEOPLE

101
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:04,966
ARE BEING SNATCHED FROM THE

102
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,801
BOSOMS OF THEIR MOTHERS.

103
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:09,037
IT'S SOULFUL AND HEARTBREAKING,

104
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:14,876
WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY AT THE

105
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,310
BORDER, YOU CAN COME IN BUT IF

106
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,678
YOU DO YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE

107
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:18,380
TAKEN FROM YOU.

108
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,680
THEN PEOPLE WILL SAY I DON'T

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,783
WANT TO BE SEPARATED FOR MY

110
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,084
CHILDREN, CAN I GO BACK ACROSS

111
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,786
THE RIO GRANDE TO THE SOUTHERN

112
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:25,420
SHORE.

113
00:04:25,420 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S A DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE
