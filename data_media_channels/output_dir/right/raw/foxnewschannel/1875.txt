IN THE HOUSE TO LEGALIZE B12 AND

4
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:16,916
PROTECT THE SO-CALLED DREAMERS

00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,384
FROM DEPORTATION.

6

HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN DISMISS

7
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:22,087

00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:23,956
PRESIDENT CAN SIGN.

10
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:26,258
THE BILL IS ALSO AT ODDS WITH

11
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:27,593

LET'S DISCUSS WHERE THIS IS ALL

16
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:35,568
HEADING.

17
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,804
IT'S A THREE CARD MONTE GOING ON

18
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:39,305
ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

19
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,373
DAVE BRAT, THIS IS WILD BECAUSE

20
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:45,377
IF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT

21
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,179
THIS MODERATE LIBERAL REPUBLICAN

22
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,681
PUSH FOR A DACA BILL AND SAYING

23
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,183
THAT IS THE PATHWAY TO THE

24
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:51,951
GOODLATTE BILL, WHAT?

25
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,452
IT'S NOT A PATHWAY TO THE GOOD

26
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,587
LOVE BILL.

27
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,354
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

28
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:58,190
>> THERE IS A COMPLICATED

29
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,158
TECHNICAL THING.

30
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:01,193
FOUR BILLS AND PLAY.

31
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:02,761
GOODLATTE WON'T PASS.

32
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,996
WHAT DOES PASS QUESTIONING THE

33
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,599
DREAMER BILL.

34
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,334
3.6 MILLION DREAMERS WITH JANE

35
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,970
IN TEN YEARS IT'S 10 MILLION

36
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,571
ILLEGAL GRANTED PATHWAY TO

37
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:12,972
CITIZENSHIP.

38
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,373
SPEAKER RYAN SAID WE ARE GOING

39
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:16,642
TO PASS THE GOODLATTE BILL.

40
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:19,378
IT IT IS IN COMMITTEE.

41
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,480
MEMBERS TOLD ME IT HASN'T PASSED

42
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:21,981
OUT OF COMMITTEE.

43
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,382
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP.

44
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,985
IF THEY WANT TO WHIP IT, THEY

45
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,219
CAN GET THE GOODLATTE BILL.

46
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:27,886
>> Laura: EVERYONE WATCHING

47
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:30,789
NEEDS TO KNOW PAUL RYAN, WE LIKE

48
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,559
PAUL RYAN BUDDIES ON HIS WAY OUT

49
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,160
HAS NOT MOVED THIS BILL IN THE

50
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,761
COMMITTEE.

51
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,196
THE COMMITTEE HAS TO MOVE IT OUT

52
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,397
TO CONSIDER ABOUT ON THE FLOOR.

53
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:39,999
IT HAS TO GO TO THE SENATE.

54
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,767
THE SENATE IS NOT GOING TO PROVE

55
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,267
THE GOODLAD BILL.

56
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:43,535
60 VOTES IN THE SENATE IS A

57
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:45,170
PROBLEM.

58
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,572
>> YOU CAN USE IT FOR THE

59
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:47,573
MIDTERMS.

60
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:48,641
CAN I PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU.

61
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,442
THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT WAS IN

62
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:50,776
INDIANA.

63
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:51,877
THIS MADE ME SMILE.

64
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,812
LET'S WATCH.

65
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:56,215
>> JOE DONNELLY VOTED AGAINST

66
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:58,083
ENHANCED VETTING.

67
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:03,956
THINK OF THAT.

68
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:07,393
WHAT, WHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD

69
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,127
ANYBODY BE DOING VOTING AGAINST

70
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,030
ENHANCED VETTING?

71
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,366
WHY?

72
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,701
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

73
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,202
>> Laura: ENHANCED VETTING FOR

74
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:18,771
PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY.

75
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,572
WHO THEY ARE, WHY THEY'RE HERE,

76
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:21,573
REFUGEES OR ANYONE ELSE.

77
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,976
>> THE GOODLAD BILL DOES

78
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:24,543
EVERYTHING WE WANT.

79
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,979
E-VERIFY, CHAIN MIGRATION,

80
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,580
BUILDS THE WALL.

81
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:28,981
EVERYTHING.

82
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,816
SENATOR OBAMA WAS FOR ALL OF

83
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:31,784
THAT.

84
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,752
>> Laura: HE WAS MR. BORDER

85
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:34,053
HAWK.

86
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,120
>> THE GOODLATTE BILL IS A

87
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,988
COPPER VISE.

88
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,957
THE DEMOCRATS ASKED THOUSAND

89
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,225
DACA, GET THEM OUT OF THE

90
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:41,527
SHADOWS MIGHT GIVE THEM PATHWAY

91
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:41,994
TO STATUS.

92
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,829
WE SAID OKAY, WILL COMPROMISE

93
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,563
WITH YOU.

94
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,198
TRUMP OFFERS 2 MILLION.

95
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:47,132
A BIGGER COMPROMISE.

96
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,568
DEMOCRATS SAY NO.

97
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,304
NOW WE HAVE 25 REPUBLICANS DOING

98
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,238
AN END RUN WITH 200 DEMOCRATS.

99
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,774
THAT'S THE PLAY.

100
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:56,942
THE PEOPLE AT HOME MISSED THE

101
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,745
MAIN POINT, IT'S 25 REPUBLICANS

102
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:02,581
LEAPFROGGING OVER LEADERSHIP.

103
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:03,982
IF THEY GET 25 --

104
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:07,586
>> Laura: ALL THEY NEED IS 25.

105
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,021
AND THEN DACA IS THE LAW OF THE

106
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:09,755
LANDS.

107
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:10,956
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

108
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:11,790
EVERYBODY WATCHING UNDERSTANDS

109
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,560
WE NEED THE GOODLATTE BILL.

110
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,160
IT'S A TRICK PONY.

111
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,562
IT'S NOT A SHOW PONY.

112
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:18,764
>> IT'S A TROJAN HORSE.

113
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,766
>> Laura: WE ARE ON EVERY

114
00:03:20,766 --> 00:00:00,000
