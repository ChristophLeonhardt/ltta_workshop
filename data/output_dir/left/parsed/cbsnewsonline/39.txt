>> WOW.
>> USA.
USA.
USA.
USA.
>> HELLO JOHNSON CITY, IT IS
GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.
I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK.
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING BACK IN
THE GREAT STATE OF TENNESSEE
WITH THOUSANDS OF HARDWORKING
AMERICAN PATRIOTS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS WE'VE
ACHIEVED THE BIGGEST COMEBACK IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED.
AND OUR COUNTRY IS RESPECTED
AGAIN.
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN.
JOBLESS CLAIMS ARE AT A 50-YEAR
LOW AND THE STOCK MARKET IS AT
AN ALL TIME HIGH.
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING.
WAGES ARE RISING.
AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING
TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE, EVER
BEFORE.
AND THINK OF THAT.
THINK OF THAT.
SUCH A SIMPLE STATEMENT.
BUT SUCH A COMPLEX THING TO DO.
THINK OF IT.
MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY
THAN EVER BEFORE.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STATEMENT.
GET OUT AND VOTE THIS NOVEMBER.
CAN ALL CHANGE AROUND QUICKLY,
FOLKS.
WE ARE DEFENDING OUR SECOND
AMENDMENT, TAKING CARE BUT
BREDISON WILL NOT DEFEND YOUR
SECOND AMENDMENT.
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR GREAT
VETERANS AND REBUILDING
AMERICA'S MILITARY MIGHT.
AND JUST TODAY WE MADE HISTORY
AGAIN WHEN I ANNOUNCED TO THE
WORLD THAT WE ARE REPLACING THE
JOB KILLING DISASTER KNOWN AS
NAFTA WITH A BRAND NEW
US-MEXICO-CANADA, WE ADDED
CANADA, WORKED OUT GREAT, TRADE
AGREEMENT.
AND WE'RE CALLING IT USMCA.
NO MORE NAFTA.
NO MORE NAFTA.
IT'S THE LARGEST TRADE DEAL THE
UNITED STATES HAS EVER
NEGOTIATED.
AND IT'S ALSO A GREAT DEAL FOR
OUR COUNTRY.
IT'S GOING TO PRODUCE JOBS AND
COMPANIES AREN'T GOING TO BE
LEAVING AND FIRING EVERYBODY AND
MAKING PRODUCT AND SENDING IT
BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES.
NO TAX.
IT'S FAIR.
IT'S MODERN.
AND IT'S BALANCED.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE TWO WONDERFUL PARTNERS
NOW.
NOW THEY'RE PARTNERS, MEXICO AND
CANADA.
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
AMERICA'S WINNING AGAIN.
AND AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED
AGAIN BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.
BUT RADICAL DEMOCRATS IN
CONGRESS ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO
ERASE EVERYTHING THAT
ACHIEVED.
THEY'RE LOOKING OUT THERE RIGHT
NOW AND THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW DID THEY TAKE AN
ELECTION BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
TAKE IT BACK.
YOU LOOK AT YOUR 401Ks.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE UP.
FROM THE TIME OF THE ELECTION,
55%.
I LOVE YOU TOO.
I LOVE YOU TOO.
HE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MY TYPE.
YOU KNOW THAT VOICE IS VERY
STRONG.
BUT I LOVE HIM.
WHOEVER YOU ARE I LOVE YOU.
WE'RE JUST FIVE WEEKS FROM ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS OF OUR
LIFETIME.
THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE WHAT WE
DID IN '16, SOMETHING THAT
NOBODY HAS SEEN, MAYBE IN OTHER
COUNTRIES, IT WAS THE GREATEST
ELECTION VICTORY IN THE HISTORY
OF OUR COUNTRY.
AND BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS WHO
ARE OBSTRUCTIONISTS, WHO ARE
PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO SEE
STRONG MILITARY, THEY DON'T WANT
BORDERS, THEY DON'T MIND CRIME.
AND THEIR ENABLERS, THE FAKE
NEWS MEDIA RIGHT BACK THERE.
WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL.
WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL.
A DEMOCRAT TAKE OVER OF CONGRESS
WILL PLUNGE OUR COUNTRY INTO
GRIDLOCK AND CHAOS AND TAKE AWAY
ALL OF THE WEALTH THAT YOU'VE
EARNED OVER THE LAST 20 MONTHS.
AND THINK OF THIS.
THE STOCK MARKET, WHICH IS UP AT
RECORD LEVELS, AND NOW THE
HIGHEST WILL DROP.
YOUR 401Ks WILL BE DEVASTATED.
YOUR TAXES WILL RISE BEYOND YOUR
WILDEST IMAGINATION, AND CRIME
WILL FLOW INTO OUR COUNTRY
THROUGH THESE OPEN BORDERS.
OTHER THAN THAT WE'LL BE DOING
VERY WELL.
IT'S CRAZY.
CRAZY.
AND WE ARE.
WE WANT TO GET MORE MONEY.
I COULD BUILD THAT THING IN ONE
YEAR.
I COULD BUILD IT.
WE GOT $1.6 BILLION AND ANOTHER
$1.6 BILLION.
WE WANT TO BUILD IT FAST.
I WANT TO BUILD IT.
SO AFTER THE ELECTION,
LEADERSHIP HAS SAID, MEANING
REPUBLICANS, THEY'RE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE
VERY STRONG.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT THE WALL IS UNDER
CONSTRUCTION.
A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE.
A LOT OF -- IF YOU LOOK AT SOME
OF IT, SOME WALL WAS UP, FALLING
DOWN, TERRIBLE CONDITION.
NOW IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BRAND NEW,
AND IT WORKS.
IT DOES WORK.
WE NEED WALL.
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY.
WE WANT -- WE GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF OUR PEOPLE.
LOOK AT WHAT'S DOING ON -- GOING
ON IN CALIFORNIA.
YOU HAVE A MAN RUNNING FOR
GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA THAT SAYS
WE DON'T WANT ANY BORDERS.
WE DON'T WANT I.C.E.
WE DO WANT SANCTUARY CITIES.
AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF HEALTH CARE.
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF
EDUCATION.
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF
EVERYTHING FOR PEOPLE THAT JUST
FLOW IN.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILLION
PEOPLE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA.
IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS.
WE HAVE IT RIGHT.
WE HAVE IT GOING PROPERLY.
THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE
VENEZUELA.
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS BEEN COME
PLATELY TAKEN OVER BY THE --
COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER BY THE
SO-CALLED RESISTANCE.
THAT'S ALL THEY DO.
THEY CAMPAIGN ON RESIST.
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THEY'RE ONLY GOOD AT ONE THING.
THEY STICK TOGETHER LIKE GLUE.
THAT'S IT.
THEY HAVE BAD POLICY.
FRANKLY, THEY'RE BAD
POLITICIANS.
EVERYTHING'S BAD, BUT THEY STICK
TOGETHER.
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL.
THEY'LL TAKE EVERYTHING,
INCLUDING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT.
THEY'LL TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY.
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE
ENTITLED TO POWER AND THEY HAVE
BEEN BLIND AND A BLIND RAGE EVER
SINCE, BOY, THEY LOST THE 2016
-- BOY, THEY HAVE GONE LOCO.
THEY HAVE GONE LOCO.
THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY.
THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE
BETWEEN A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT
IS BUILDING OUR FUTURE AND A
DEMOCRAT PARTY THAT IS TRYING TO
BURN OUR FUTURE DOWN.
THE DEMOCRATS ONLY KNOW HOW TO
OBSTRUCT, DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY
AS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS.
DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO DO
ANYTHING AND TO HURT ANYONE TO
GET THEIR WAY, LIKE THEY'RE
DOING WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DESTROY
HIM SINCE THE VERY FIRST SECOND
HE WAS ANNOUNCED BECAUSE THEY
KNOW THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL
FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION AS
WRITTEN.
THAT'S BEEN HIS HISTORY.
AND HE'S A GOOD MAN.
GREAT STUDENT.
GREAT INTELLECT.
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, OH, LET'S GO
BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL.
THEY MAYBE SHOULD GO BEFORE HIGH
SCHOOL.
AND I KNOW SO MANY OF THEM, YOU
HAVE THE GREAT VIETNAM WAR HERO
WHO DIDN'T GO TO VIETNAM, YOU
KNOW THAT.
BLUMENTHAL.
HOW ABOUT BLUMENTHAL?
HOW ABOUT BLUMENTHAL?
WE CALL HIM DA NANG BLUMENTHAL.
15 YEARS, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
CONNECTICUT.
HE WENT AROUND TELLING WAR
STORIES.
PEOPLE DYING LEFT AND RIGHT BUT
MY PLATOON MARCHED FORWARD.
HE WAS NEVER IN VIETNAM.
IT WAS A LIE.
THEN HE'S UP THERE SAYING WE
WANT THE TRUTH FROM JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, AND YOU'RE GETTING
THE TRUTH FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
UNBELIEVABLE.
UNBELIEVABLE.
DA NANG.
YOU KNOW DA N ANG, RIGHT --
NANG, RIGHT?
GREAT CITY IN VIETNAM.
AND THEN YOU HAVE CORY BOOKER
WHO DESTROYED NEWARK.
I MEAN THE JOB HE DID IN NEWARK,
NEW JERSEY.
AND SEE?
SOME OF THE THINGS HE WROTE WHEN
HE WAS YOUNG ABOUT WOMEN.
TAKE A LOOK, OKAY?
AND THEN THEY WANT TO TAKE A LOT
LONGER WITH THE FBI.
NO, THE FBI, THEY SHOULD TAKE,
BY THE WAY, IF WE TOOK TEN
YEARS, THEY'D WANT MORE TIME.
BUT THEY WANT TO TAKE A LOT
LONGER.
BUT DIANNE FEINSTEIN SHE HAD
THIS -- SHE HAD THIS LETTER FOR
MONTHS.
AND SHE DIDN'T REVEAL IT UNTIL
EVERYTHING WAS FIN.
THEN SHE REVEALED IT.
THEN SHE SAYS, OH, WE WANT MORE
TIME.
LET'S SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT, BUT
I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY'RE TRYING
TO DESTROY A VERY FINE PERSON.
AND WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.
WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.
DEMOCRATS WANT ACTIVISTS,
LEFT-WING JUDGES WHO WILL
TOTALLY REWRITE THE LAWS, ERASE
YOUR BORDERS, AND REPLACE YOUR
VALUES.
YOU DON'T WANT THAT IN
TENNESSEE.
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT A JUDGE'S
JOB IS TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND TO
DELIVER EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL.
THE DEMOCRATS CAN NO LONGER BE
TRUSTED WITH YOUR POWER AND WITH
THEIR POWER.
YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.
THEY HAVE MOVED SO FAR LEFT THAT
POCAHONTAS IS CONSIDERED A
CONSERVATIVE.
TRUE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ELIZABETH WARREN.
SHE SAID SHE'S CONSIDERING A RUN
FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
PLEASE, PLEASE REASON.
HOW ABOUT THAT GROUP?
BIDEN.
BIDEN.
WE CALL HIM 1% BIDEN.
UNTIL OBAMA TOOK HIM OFF THE
TRASH HEAP HE COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING.
NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT RUNNING.
TOUGH GUY.
HE'S A TOUGH GUY.
HE'S A REAL GENIUS.
I WANT TO CHALLENGE HIM TO A
FIGHT BEHIND THE BARN.
OH WOULD I LOVE THAT.
WOULDN'T THAT BE GOOD?
I WANT TO CHALLENGE DONALD
TRUMP.
REMEMBER THAT?
HE GOT A LITTLE UPSET.
HE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY.
THEY'VE GT SOME REAL BEAUTIES
GOING.
THIS NOVEMBER -- GOT SOME REAL
BEAUTIES GOING.
THIS NOVEMBER 6TH YOU'VE GOT A
CHANCE TO REJECT THE OUTRAGEOUS
POLICIES OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.
NOT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT THE
DEMOCRAT PARTY.
SOUNDS WORSE, RIGHT?
THAT'S THEIR REAL NAME.
IT'S THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.
BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT, YOU GT
TO VOTE FOR REPUBLICAN -- GOT TO
VOTE FOR REPUBLICAN.
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS TO GET
THE VES.
STOP THE CRIME.
YOU KNOW, I SAID THE OTHER
NIGHT, I SAID, YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'M GOING TO KEEP IT.
IT'S A LITTLE HARSH, BUT I'M
GOING TO KEEP IT.
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF
CRIME.
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
THEY'RE THE PARTY OF CRIME.
SOUNDS A LITTLE TOUGH, BUT IT'S
TRUE.
OPEN BORDERS.
WE'RE THRILLED TO BE JOINED BY
MANY TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS.
PEOPLE THAT ARE FRIEND OF MINE.
PEOPLE THAT HAVE HELPED ME.
PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOUR STATE AND
THEY LOVE OTHER STATES AND THEY
LOVE OUR COUNTRY.
ONE OF THEM IS A MAN THAT
EVERYBODY KNOWS IN THIS STATE
VERY WELL.
HIS NAME IS PHIL ROWE.
PHIL.
THANK YOU PHIL.
HE'S ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU.
THANK YOU PHIL.
ANOTHER MAN SAID THIS IS WHEN
EFS MR. TRUMP, NOT MR. PRESIDENT
-- I WAS MR. TRUMP, NOT
MR. PRESIDENT.
HE SAID WE DO EARLY VOTING IN
TENNESSEE.
HE SAID, SIR, I WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT OF
THE MOUNTAINS, OUT OF THE
RIVERS, THEY'RE COMING OUT OF
THE VALLEYS.
THEY'RE COMING.
HE SAID -- RIGHT?
THEY'RE COMING OUT OF
EVERYWHERE.
HE SAID HIVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
-- -- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
-- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30
YEARS OR MORE.
WE HAD LIKE 30 DAYS, BUT YOU
HAVE EARLY VOTING IN TENNESSEE.
HE SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT.
PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T VOTED
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T LIKED
ANYBODY.
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
THESE ARE GREAT, INCREDIBLE
PEOPLE BUT THEY DIDN'T LIKE WHAT
THEY HAD TO GO FOR.
NOW THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH
TRUMP BANNERS, TRUMP HATS, YOU
KNOW MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
AND THIS MAN, HE SAID I CAN'T
SPEAK FOR THE REST OF OUR
NATION, BUT IF THE NATION'S LIKE
TENNESSEE, YOU'RE GOING TO WIN
BY A LOT.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HAPPENED, RIGHT?
JOHN DUNCAN, CONGRESSMAN.
JOHN, THANK YOU JOHN.
WHERE'S JOHN?
THANK YOU JOHN.
HE MADE ME FEEL VERY GOOD BEFORE
THE ELECTION.
A FRIEND OF MINE.
A GREAT CONGRESSMAN, SOMEONE
WHO'S REALLY WORKED HARD.
EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT FROM YOUR
STATE, DOES IT MATTER?
HE HAS BEEN SO STRONG, SO SMART.
HE LOVES THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH,
CONGRESSMAN MARK MEADOWS.
THANK YOU, MARK.
AND DEBORAH.
DEBORAH, THANK YOU, DEB.
CONGRESSMAN CHUCK FLIESHMAN WHO
HAS BEEN -- FLIESMAN WHO HAS
BEEN FANTASTIC.
WHERE'S CHUCK?
THANK YOU, CHUCK.
CHUCK HAS BEEN GREAT.
MORGAN GRIFFITH, SCOTT DAYJARLE,
MY FAVORITE NAME IN POLITICS.
THANK YOU, YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEVOTE A LOT OF
TIME, THESE ARE JUST GREAT
PEOPLE.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE OUR
COUNTRY.
THEY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
STRONG BORDERS, STRONG LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
YOU WANT TO BE SAFE.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
PAYING LOW TAXES.
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING WRONG.
YOU WANT TO HAVE A STRONG
MILITARY, ESPECIALLY IN THESE
TIMES.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE A STRONG
MILITARY, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
HAVE TO USE IT.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE TO
USE IT.
AND WE'RE GOING TO VERY SHORTLY
HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY
WE'VE EVER HAD.
WE'RE ALSO JOINED THANK YOU
ALL, WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY FUTURE
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
TIM B USHGRCHE -- BURCHET.
THANK YOU, TIM.
JOHN ROSE, JOHN, THANK YOU JOHN.
MARK GREEN, I HEAR THEY'RE UP
PRETTY GOOD, BUT DON'T TAKE ANY
CHANCES.
DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.
YOU GOT TO GO VOTE.
DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.
WE GOT TO GET THEM IN.
BUT THEY'RE UP PRETTY GOOD.
THIS IS A OF A STATE, I'LL
TELL YOU THAT.
THESE PEOPLE.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR GREAT
GOVERNOR.
I HAD DINNER WITH HIM THE OTHER
NIGHT.
IT WAS A FASCINATING DINNER.
HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB AS
GOVERNOR.
GOVERNOR BILL HASLEM, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, BILL, THANK YOU.
AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR RANDY
McNALLY, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, RANDY.
GREAT, GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU.
GREAT JOB.
AND VERY IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE
TENNESSEE'S NEXT GOVERNOR, BILL
LEIGH.
AND A MAN WHO DID A FANTASTIC
JOB DURING THE ELECTION FOR
TRUMP.
I WILL TELL YOU.
STATE PARTY CHAIRMAN, SCOTT
GOLDEN.
THANK YOU SCOTT, THANKS SCOTT.
THANKS.
AND FINALLY THE PERSON WE ARE
HERE TONIGHT TO SUPPORT.
WE CHERISH THIS PERSON.
SHE'S A FIGHTER, A TRUE FIGHTER,
FOR THE PEOPLE OF TENNESSEE.
SHE LOVES YOUR STATE, AND SHE'S
YOUR NEXT U.S. SENATOR.
SHE'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC,
MARSHA BLACKBURN.
MARSHA, COME UP, PLEASE.
>> THERE WE GO.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR
COMING BACK TO TENNESSEE.
WE LOVE THE PRESIDENT IN
TENNESSEE.
AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO
EACH OF YOU FORKING WITH HERE
TONIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOU
ARE DOING TO ELECT ALL OF THESE
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THAT WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT.
AND THANK YOU FOR SENDING DONALD
J. TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE HAS HAD AN AMAZING 20 MONTHS.
YOU'VE JUST HEARD SOME OF THOSE
THINGS.
NOT TO EVEN MENTION THE FOREIGN
POLICY THAT HE HAS ACHIEVED.
DEALING WITH CHINA, NORTH KOREA.
GETTING US OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL.
AND MR. PRESIDENT, WE IN
TENNESSEE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT
YOU MOVED THE U.S. EMBASSY FROM
TEL-AVIV TO JERUSALEM.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I KNOW, I KNOW THAT THE
DEMOCRATS KEEP SAYING THAT THERE
IS A BLUE WAVE COMING, BUT LET
ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN THAT BLUE
WAVE GETS TO THE STATE LINE, IT
IS GOING TO RUN SMACK DAB INTO
THE GREAT RED WALL.
AND THAT IS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
YOU.
SOUTH CALIFORNIA YOU WANT A U.S.
SENATOR -- YOU.
SO IF YOU WANT A U.S. SENATOR
WHO'S GOING TO BUILD THE WALL,
CUT YOUR TAXES, AND MAKE CERTAIN
THAT WE TAKE CARE OF OUR MEN AND
WOMEN IN UNIFORM, I AM ASKING
YOU TO STAND WITH ME.
LET'S TAKE THESE TENNESSEE
VALUES TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND
PUT THEM TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP.
THANK YOU ALL.
>> SO I JUST WANT TO THANK
MARSHA BLACKBURN.
AND I WILL TELL YOU SHE'S ALL
ABOUT TENNESSEE VALUES.
THAT'S THE ONE.
SHE'S GOT TENNESSEE VALUES.
A VOTE FOR MARSHA IS REALLY A
VOTE FOR ME AND EVERYTHING THAT
WE STAND FOR.
IT'S A VOTE FOR MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
A VOTE FOR BREDISON IS A VOTE
FOR CHUCK SCHUMER, NANCY PELOSI,
AND THE REAL LEADER OF THE
DEMOCRATS, MAXINE WATERS.
PHIL BREDISON WANTS TO RAISE
YOUR TAXES.
AS GOVERNOR, REMEMBER THIS,
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, SEEMS
LIKE A NAS GUY.
BUT WHAT -- NICE GUY, BUT WHAT
GOOD DOES THAT DO?
AS GOVERNOR HE RAISED TAXES AND
FEES IN YOUR STATE BY MORE THAN
$1 BILLION.
HE OPPOSES THE BORDER WALL
TOTALLY.
HE SUPPORTED DRIVER CERTIFICATES
FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS.
AND ON HIS WATCH TENNESSEE
UNEMPLOYMENT DOUBLED.
IT DOUBLED IN WHATEVER IT WAS,
HOW LONG WAS HE THERE?
EIGHT?
IT DOUBLED.
YOU WANT HIM TO BE RUNNING, I
DON'T THINK SO.
HE DOUBLED UNEMPLOYMENT.
IN 2010, PHIL WROTE A BOOK
ADVOCATING GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH
CARE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
YOU WANT TO WAIT IN LINE FOR
ABOUT SIX WEEKS TO GET TAKEN
CARE OF.
AND CALLED FOR IT TO BE FUNDED
BY A 20% PAYROLL TAX ON ALL OF
THE HARDWORKING AMERICANS, MANY
ARE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW.
GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
THAT HASN'T PROVEN TOO
SUCCESSFUL ANYWHERE ELSE.
PHIL WAS A MAJOR FINANCIAL
SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
OF HILLARY CROOKED HILLARY
CLINTON.
CROOKED AS
NOW PHIL IS RUNNING TO BE THE
51ST SENATE DEMOCRAT AND THE
51ST DEMOCRATS ARE ELECTED IN
NOVEMBER, THEN CHUCK SCHUMER
WILL BECOME A MAJORITY LEADER.
YOU PUT IN 51.
EVEN THOUGH HE SAID SOMETHING
GOOD ABOUT OUR DEAL WITH CANADA
AND MEXICO TODAY, BUT HOW CAN
YOU NOT SAY GOOD?
THAT'S WHY SCHUMER IS SO
DESPERATE FOR PHIL TO WIN.
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT WE STAND
FOR WILL NEVER GET THE VOTES.
WE NEED VOTES.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
NUMBER ONE, MARSHA WILL BE A
GREAT GREAT SENATOR.
BUT NUMBER TWO, WE NEED THE
VOTES.
WE GOT TO HAVE THE VOTE.
AND HE WILL NEVER ONCE VOTE FOR
US.
JUST REMEMBER, HE WILL NEVER
VOTE FOR US.
NOT ON JUDGES.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS
THEY SAY I GOT ELECTED, THE
SUPREME COURT JUDGE, THEY SAY
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING
THE PRESIDENT CAN DO IS PICK A
SUPREME COURT JUDGE.
SO WE PICKED JUSTICE NEIL
GORSUCH WHO HAS BEEN FANTASTIC.
AND NOW JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS
ACTUALLY DOING WELL.
I REALLY BELIEVE.
WE'VE GOT TO DO IT.
WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE
PUSHED AROUND.
PHIL IS ONLY RUNNING BECAUSE
CHUCK SCHUMER CALLED HIM UP AND
BEGGED HIM.
THE WORD IS BEGGED HIM TO RUN
BECAUSE SCHUMER KNOWS THE
DEMOCRATS PATH OF POWER RUNS
RIGHT THROUGH TENNESSEE.
AGAIN, SECOND AMENDMENT, HIGHER
TAXES, LOTS OF CRIME, MS-13, GET
USED TO THEM.
NO I.C.E.
WE DON'T WANT I.C.E.
THEY SAY.
IF YOU WANT TO STOP SCHUMER FROM
BECOMING MAJORITY LEADER, IF YOU
WANT TO STOP YOUR TAXES FROM
GOING UP 50% OR MORE, THAT'S
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, THEN YOU
MUST VOTE AGAINST BREDISON.
YOUR VOTE IN THIS ELECTION WILL
DECIDE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE
SENATE.
THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT IS.
YOU KNOW?
I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU NO, BUT
THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT IS.
A DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED SENATE
WILL ALWAYS BE RAISING YOUR
TAXES.
THEY'LL ALWAYS THROW OPEN YOUR
BRDER.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO --
BORDER.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO
CHANGE IT.
HE'S GOING TO VOTE WITH THE
DEMOCRATS.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE -- I MEAN,
YOU LOOK AT HEALTH CARE.
WE GOT NO VOTES.
WE DAVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX CUTS
IN -- GAVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX
CUTS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS
COUNTRY.
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE.
AND THEY DON'T VOTE FOR A
REASON.
THEY DON'T VOTE BECAUSE IT'S BAD
FOR TRUMP.
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO
STOP ANYTHING WE DO.
IF IT'S REALLY GOOD, THEY STILL
WANT TO STOP IT.
AND WE DON'T WANT TO LET THAT
HAPPEN.
WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLE THINGS
PLANNED.
AND WE NEED TO LET IT HAPPEN.
THEY'RE GOING TO FLOOD YOUR
STREETS WITH CRIMINAL ALIENS.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
THEY'RE ALWAYS ATTACKING LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF
SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT,
RIGHT?
TREMENDOUS EQUIPMENT.
YOU KNOW, HEAVY ARMOR, DIFFERENT
THINGS.
THAT KEEP THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
PROFESSIONALS, PEOPLE THAT WE
LOVE THAT KEEPS THEM SAFE.
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO
THEM.
I HAVE GIVEN IT TO THEM, I'M
SORRY.
THEY WANT TO BLOCK YOUR GREAT
JUDGES.
THEY WANT TO WEAEN THE
MILITARY.
IT'S NOT EVEN WEAKEN.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY
MONEY ON THE MILITARY.
THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT
MILITARY, NUMBER ONE YOU NEED
IT.
JOBS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MILITARY,
IT'S NOT THE JOBS.
THAT'S TOTALLY SECONDARY.
BUT WE WILL SOON HAVE THE
STRONGEST MILITARY THAT WE'VE
EVER HAD.
WE HAD FIGHTER JETS AND WE
AIRPLANES.
AND OUR MILITARY, THE FATHER
FLEW THEM, THE GRANDFATHER FLEW
THEM, AND THE SON GOES IN FLYING
THE SAME PLANES.
YOU KNOW WHAT IN?
THEY'RE ALL GOING FAST.
WE'VE ORDERED THE FINEST JETS IN
THE WORLD.
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THEY'RE
MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE USA, ALL
OF THEM.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.
THEY WANT TO OUTLAW PRIVATE
HEALTH INSURANCE SO YOU'LL GET
GREAT HEALTH INSURANCE AND WE'RE
ALREADY DOING IT.
WE'RE PROVIDING YOU WITH
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF
COMPETITION.
YOU'RE GETTING GREAT HEALTH
INSURANCE AND IT'S GOING TO GET
BETTER WHEN WE CAN GET A FEW
MORE VOTES SO WE CAN DO IT THE
WAY YOU WANT IT.
THIS IS THE WAY YOU WANT IT.
THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN AMERICAN
ENERGY AND REPLACE FREEDOM WITH
SOCIALISM.
THEY WANT A TURN -- IT'S TRUE --
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TURN
AMERICA INTO VENEZUELA.
THAT'LL BE WONDERFUL.
THAT'LL BE WONDERFUL.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT
HAPPEN.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, EVEN MOST
DEMOCRATS, I CAN'T BELIEVE, WHEN
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH SANCTUARY CITIES AND
EVERYTHING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE MOST OF THEM ARE
GOING FOR IT.
ALSO AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION
IS MEDICARE.
DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON WANT TO
RAID MEDICARE TO PAY FOR THEIR
SOCIALISM.
DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING SO-CALLED
MEDICINE FOR ALL, ROBBING OUR
SENIORS OF ALL OF THEIR MEDICARE
BENEFITS.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT
MEDICARE AND OUR GREAT SENIORS
WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND PAID FOR
IT.
AND WE ALWAYS PROTECT AMERICANS
WITH THEIR PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS.
WE'RE DOING THAT.
ON PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, A LOT
OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S NOT A VERY
REPUBLICAN THING.
IT IS NOW, AND IT HAS BEEN FOR
ME.
I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE
WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
WE'RE DOING WELL.
WE CAN DO IT.
DEMOCRATS ALSO WANT TO GIVE
WELFARE AND FREE HEALTH CARE TO
ILLEGAL ALIENS.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT
PUBLIC BENEFITS.
AND WE DO, WE WANT TO PROTECT
BENEFITS AND PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR
TRULY NEEDY AMERICANS, AMERICANS
THAT NEED HELP.
DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH I.C.E.
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO
ABOLISH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT
ENTIRELY.
AND THE DEMOCRAT PARTY SUPPORTS
SANCTUARY CITIES THAT UNLEASH
VIOLENT PREDATORS LIKE MS-13
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.
AND REMEMBER WHAT I SAID.
IT'S THE PARTY OF CRIME.
DEMOCRATS, THEY REALLY ARE.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
EVEN LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING
IN CONGRESS.
EVEN LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH OUR LAWS, THE WAY THEY
TREAT OUR LAWS.
THE WAY THEY TREAT OUR COUNTRY.
WHAT THEY DO IN CONGRESS.
THEY ARE INDEED THE PARTY OF
CRIME.
EVERY DAY INNOCENT LIVES ARE
STOLEN BECAUSE OF
DEMOCRAT-SUPPORTED IMMIGRANT
POLICIES.
IF YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK, YOU
HAVE IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT
ARE SO BAD, SO DANGEROUS, JUST
RECENTLY IN CALIFORNIA AN
ILLEGAL ALIEN WITH A SEX CRIME
CONVICTION AND OTHER CONVICTIONS
HAD A PRIOR DEPORTATION.
THEY WANTED TO DEPORT THIS
PERSON.
THEY NEVER DID.
HE WAS CONVICTED FOR KILLING A
LOCAL FOOTBALL COACH WH LEAVES
BEHIND A WIFE -- WHO LEAVES
BEHIND A WIFE AND SIX BEAUTIFUL
KIDS.
A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY.
THIS IS ALL OVER.
YOU COULD DO THIS FOR DAYS.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE AMERICA
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR
CRIMINAL ALIENS.
AND REPUBLICANS PROUDLY STAND
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF
I.C.E., BORDER PATROL, AND WE
STAND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THIS ELECTION IN NOVEMBER IS
ABOUT SAFETY AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT
PROSPERITY, THE PROSPERITY OF
OUR COUNTRY.
WE ARE DOING THINGS NOW THAT
NOBODY BELIEVES.
WE ARE HITTING NUMBERS THAT
NOBODY BELIEVES.
HERE ARE JUST SOME OF OUR
ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE ELECTION DAY,
THANK YOU.
WE'VE CREATED OVER 4 MILLION NEW
JOBS.
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS
POSSIBLE.
4 MILLION AND LIFTED ALMOST 4
MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD
STAMPS.
WE'VE ADDED NEARLY 600,000
MANUFACTURING JOBS.
THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
REMEMBER WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
SAID?
YOU CAN'T DO MANUFACTURING.
MAGIC WAND, RIGHT?
YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND.
YOU DON'T NEED A MAGIC WAND.
YOU NEED PROPER POLICIES.
YOU NEED A LOT OF THINGS.
YOU DOEBD NEED A MAGIC -- DON'T
NEED A MAGIC WAND.
REMEMBER THIS, AND YOU'VE HEARD
ME SAY THIS A LOT, I'M PROUD OF
IT.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT,
THINK OF IT, JUST REACHED THE
LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED.
RIGHT?
RIGHT?
RIGHT?
AFTER YEARS OF DEMOCRATS FAILING
AND ABANDONING
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, REPUBLICANS
ARE DELIVERING FOR
AFRICAN-AMERICANS LIKE NEVER
BEFORE.
WE'RE DOING THE JOB.
AND YOU SAW THAT THE OTHER NIGHT
WITH KANYE WEST.
HOW GOOD WAS KANYE WEST?
AND BIG JIM BROWN.
AND SO MANY OTHERS.
WE'RE SUPPORTED BY SO MANY GREAT
FOLKS.
JIM BROWN, BOY, WE COULD USE HIM
ON SOME OF THOSE TEAMS RIGHT
NOW, COULDN'T WE?
COULDN'T WE?
HISPANIC AMERICAN AND ASIAN
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT ALSO
REACHED ALL TIME LOWS.
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RECENTL
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 65
YEARS.
THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT
SOON.
I THINK IT WILL BE IN HISTORY.
AND LAST WEEK I SIGNED A
GROUNDBREAKING NEW TRADE DEAL
WITH SOUTH KOREA THAT
DRAMATICALLY INCREASES AMERICAN
EXPORTS.
REMEMBER THAT DEAL?
REMEMBER THAT DEAL?
HILLARY CLINTON, THAT WAS A
HILLARY DEAL, SHE SAID WE MUST
HAVE THIS DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA.
IT WILL CREATE 250,000 JOBS.
AND IT DID, FOR SOUTH KOREA, NOT
US.
IT CREATED JOBS FOR SOUTH KOREA.
WE NOW HAVE A GOOD THING.
FRIEND OR FOE, FRIEND OR FOE?
FRIEND.
OKAY.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
WHEN YOU HEAR LITTLE NOISES LIKE
THAT, YOU SAY FOE, GET THEM OUT.
BUT THEY'RE FRIENDS.
WE ONLY HAVE FRIEND IN TENNESSEE
I THINK -- FRIENDS IN TENNESSEE
I THINK.
WE'RE ALSO ENTERING NEW TRADE
TALKS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
WHICH FRANKLY HAS TREATED US
VERY BALY.
AND WITH JAPAN.
JAPAN SEND US MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS OF CARS, AND WE'RE
WORKING ON A TRADE DEAL.
WE'RE WORKING ON A TRADE DEAL.
IT'LL BE COMING.
AND WE ARE CRACKING DOWN ON
CHINA'S UNFAIR AND ABUSIVE TRADE
PRACTICES.
GOT TO DO IT.
WE'VE BEEN LOSING 300, 400, 500
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO CHINA.
NO MORE.
NO MORE.
RIGHT?
NO MORE.
CAN'T DO IT.
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER
NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY
REBUILDING OUR NATION.
AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH AMERICAN
ALUMINUM AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH
AMERICAN STEEL.
AND OUR STEEL IS DOING REALLY
WELL.
REALLY WELL.
TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS
OF TENNESSEE FAMILIES WE PASSED
THE BIGGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS
AND REFORMS IN THE HISTORY OF
OUR COUNTRY.
AND WE ELIMINATED THE CORE OF
OBAMACARE.
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE.
IT'S GONE.
THE WORST PART OF OBAMA.
AND AS BAD AS THOSE PREMIUMS
ARE, WE'VE KEPT THOSE PREMIUMS
DOWN.
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS, BUT
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE
PREMIUMS FOR THE REMNANTS OF
OBAMACARE DOWN.
IT'LL ALL GET TAKEN CARE OF.
WE NEED A FEW MORE VOTES.
>> WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LOWERED
HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN THE
STATE 06 TENNESSEE BY 26 --
STATE OF TENNESSEE BY 26%.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
UNDER THE PAST ADMINISTRATION IT
WAS LIKE A ROCKET SHIP GOING UP
-- ROCKETSHIP GOING UP TO HELP
PEOPLE ACCESS LIFE-SAVING
TREATMENTS WE JUST PASSED
SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO
PASS FOR 45 YEARS.
RIGHT TO TRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT?
MEADOWS HELPED WITH THAT ONE.
AND PHIL HELPED WITH THAT ONE,
RIGHT PHIL?
PHIL ROWWE.
AND GREG.
WE HAVE MEDICINES THAT HAVE
GREAT HELP, GREAT FUTURE, THEY
LOOK GOOD, THEY'RE PROMISING.
WE HAD NO RIGHT TO GIVE THOSE
MEDICINES TO SOMEONE WHO'S
TERMINAL, GOING TO DIE.
IF THEY HAD MONEY THEY TRAVELLED
THE WORLD TO FIND A CURE.
YET WE HAVE THE GREATEST DOCTORS
AND MEDICINE IN THE WORLD HERE.
BUT IT WOULD BE YEARS.
IT USED TO BE 14, 15 YEARS.
I THINK WE HAVE IT DOWN TO 3.5,
4.
SCOTT IS DOING A GREAT JOB, FDA.
45 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO
PASS.
NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.
I WILL TELL YOU, NOT THAT EASY.
BUT WE GOT IT PASSED.
SO NOW SOMEBODY IS TERMINALLY
ILL.
AND IF WE'VE GOT A DRUG THAT
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO HELP,
WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE IT TO THOSE
PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ALREADY WE'VE HAD SUCCESS.
SOME OF THESE DRUGS ARE WORKING.
SOME OF THESE DOCTORINGS ARE
WORKING.
I'M -- DRUGS ARE WORKING.
I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.
RIGHT TO TRY.
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE
IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO USE
IT.
BUT IF YOU DO, DOESN'T IT MAKE
SENSE INSTEAD OF IF YOU DON'T
HAVE MONEY YOU GO HOME AND LAUZ
HOPE.
IF YOU HAVE MONEY -- LOSE HOPE.
IF YOU HAVE MONEY YOU GO ALL
OVER THE WORLD TRYING TO FIND
THE CURE.
RIGHT TO TRY.
REMEMBER THAT.
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
WE ALSO PASSED VETERAN'S CHOICE.
ANY VETERANS IN THE CHOICE?
YES.
YOU, YOUNG VETERAN, YOUNG.
WE JUST PASSED CHOICE.
THAT WAS # 4 YEARS.
-- 44 YEARS.
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO PASS
CHOICE.
IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE FOR
20, 30 DAYS MONTHS, YOU DON'T DO
THAT ANYMORE.
IF THE LINE'S BIG AND YOU'RE
UNHAPPY WITH IT, YOU GO TO A
PRIVATE DOCTOR, THEY TAKE CARE
OF YOU, AND WE PAY THE BILL.
IT'S BETTER.
AND YOU SAVE A LOT OF MONEY.
IT'S BETTER.
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO PASS THAT
ONE FOR MANY MANY DECADES.
THEY COULDN'T DO IT.
WE GOT IT PASSED.
WE'RE GOOD AT PASSING THINGS,
RIGHT?
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD AT PASSING THINGS,
RIGHT?
OH LOOK, COME HERE, STAND UP
PHIL ROWE, STAND UP.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT, PHIL.
MAN,NO WONDER THEY LOVE YOU IN
TENNESSEE.
GREAT, RIGHT?
AND ANOTHER WEPT ONE.
WE JUST PASSED THE LANDMARK VA
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.
RIGHT?
VA ACCOUNTABILITY.
THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES
AT THE VA, VETERANS
ADMINISTRATION, WHO ARE
TERRIBLE.
WHO TREAT OUR GREAT GREAT
WARRIORS WHO ARE TROUBLED.
NOT WELL.
THEY'RE SADISTS.
THEY STEAL, THEY ROB.
THEY DO BAD THINGS.
SOME OF THEM.
SOME PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLE.
BUT WE NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO
AFTER THEM.
WE NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE
THEM.
THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY ADDS A BIG
THING.
AND JUST LAST WEEK I SIGNED A
RECORD $716 WL FUNDING BILLION
FOR OUR MILL -- BILLION FUNDING
BILL FOR OUR MILITARY.
AND WE ARE GIVING OUR TROOPS THE
BIGGEST PAY RAISE THEY'VE HAD IN
OVER A DECADE.
THEY DESERVE IT.
AND I JUST WITHDREW THE UNITED
STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE
ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL OR
DISASTER.
AND WE'VE RECOGNIZED THE CAPITAL
OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE U.S.
EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM.
WE'VE DONE -- WE'VE DONE SO
MUCH.
OPPONENT AFTER POINT, I WILL NOT
DO THIS TO YOU.
BUT PAGE AFTER PAGE AFTER PAGE
AFTER PAGE AFTER PAGE.
I MEAN LOOK AT THIS.
CREATED JOBS, 4 MILLION, CREATED
MANUFACTURING, 600,000.
I MEAN, YOU JUST GO POINT AFTER
POINT AFTER -- EACH ONE IS A
MAJOR POINT.
I MEAN, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO
BORE YOU.
NOBODY'S DONE THIS MUCH IN THEIR
FIRST TWO YEARS, PROBABLY ANY
TWO YEARS, NOBODY HAS DONE WHAT
WE, NOT ME, WHAT WE HAVE DONE
WITH THE HELP OF ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE AND ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE,
NOBODY.
TRUE.
NOBODY HAS DONE WHAT WE'VE DONE.
LORE USA.
U --
>> USA USA, USA, USA.
>> AND WE'VE CUT MORE
REGULATIONS THAN ANY
ADMINISTRATION WHETHER IT'S TWO
YEARS, FOUR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS,
12 YEARS IN ONE CASE.
WE HAVE CUT MORE THAN ANY
PRESIDENT, ANY ADMINISTRATION IN
TWO YEARS AND IT'S LESS THAN
WITH THE YEARS, WE HAVE CUT MORE
REGULATIONS.
AND YET, WE HAVE CRYSTAL CLEAN
WATER.
WE HAVE PURE, BEAUTIFUL AIR.
WE'RE INTO THAT.
ALSO FOLKS, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TURN OFF ALL BUSINESS AND
SEND BUSINESS TO FOREIGN
COUNTRIES TO GET IT.
UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE ARE
NO LONGER APOLOGIZING FOR
AMERICA.
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR AMERICA.
STANDING UP.
AND WE'RE STANDING UP FOR YOUR
VALUES.
WAER STANDING UP FOR TON --
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR TENNESSEE.
AND WE ARE STANDING UP VERY
PROUDLY FOR OUR FLAG AND OUR
NATIONAL ANTHEM.
WE ARE LIFTING MILLIONS OF OUR
CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK,
FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE,
AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
WE'RE BUILDING A FUTURE OF
SAFETY AND HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY.
AND EVERY CITY AND EVERY
COMMUNITY IN EVERY PART OF THIS
GREAT LAND IS PROSPERING LIKE
THEY REALLY HAVE NEVER PROSPERED
BEFORE.
YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH.
THAT'S WHY OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW I
HOPE THEY HAVEN'T LEFT.
WE PUT BIG SCREENS OUT THERE FOR
THEM.
BUT YOU HAVE CLOSE TO 20,000
PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE.
IN THE GREAT STATE OF MISSOURI
YOU HAD A BIG, BEAUTIFUL ARENA.
I ALWAYS SAY MADISON SQUARE
GARDEN LESS MAYBE 30%.
BIG, BEAUTIFUL ARENA.
IT WAS PACKED.
AND IN MISSOURI THEY HAD 40 --
YOU SAW IT -- 45,000 PEOPLE
OUTSIDE.
CAN'T THINK OF IT.
SO SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.
AND BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY,
CLAIRE McCASKILL, ANOTHER
DISASTER IS BEING SOUNDLY BEATEN
WE HOPE.
WE HOPE.
MISSOURI.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
45,000.
SO WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT
OF ALL CHERN TO HAVE A SAFE --
CHILDREN TO HAVE A SAFE HOME, A
GREAT SCHOOL, A LOVING FAMILY,
AND A LADDER THAT RAISES THEM UP
TO REACH THEIR HIGHEST DREAMS.
WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?
W'RE UNLEASHING THE POWER OF
FAITH.
WE NEED MORE FAITH IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THE MIGHT OF JUSTICE AND THE
GLORY OF FREEDOM.
IT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT.
BUT TO CONTINUE THIS INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM, MOMENTUM LIKE I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD THIS IN
THE COUNTRY.
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN
CORRECTED.
I SAID THE 2016 ELECTION MAY
HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST ELECTION
OF ALL TIME.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.
AND WE HAD TO FIGHT THE
DEMOCRATS BUT MORE DIFFICULT WAS
FIGHTING A VERY VERY DISHONEST
MEDIA.
THAT WAS MUCH MORE -- FIGHTING
THE MEDIA IS TOUGHER THAN
FIGHTING THE DEMOCRATS.
BUT THEY'RE EQUAL PARTNERS.
SO YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR FRIENDS,
GET YOUR FAMILY, GET YOUR
NEIGHBORS, GET YOUR COWORKERS,
AND GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.
AND VOTE FOR MARSHA BLACKBURN
AND BILL LEIGH AND ALL OF THE
GREAT REPUBLICANS THAT ARE
RUNNING.
BILL LEIGH GOING TO BE A GREAT
GOVERNOR.
A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS SA VOTE
FOR LOWER -- IS A VOTE FOR LOWER
TAXES LESS REGULATION.
THAT'S A BIG FACTOR.
AND MORE PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT
HERE IN THE GOOD OLD USA
REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS?
WE HAD SIGNS ON CARS AND LITTLE
DECALS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
IT SAID MADE IN THE USA.
GUESS WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
MADE IN THE US A, IT'S COMING
BACK.
-- USA, IT'S COMING BACK.
IT'S A VOTE TO REDUCE CRIME,
RESPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND
RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW.
VERY SIMPLE.
IT'S A VOTE FOR STRONG VOTERS,
SAFE COMMUNITIES, AND THRIVING
FAMILIES.
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A
VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT
POLITICS OF ANGER, DESTRUCTION,
CHAOS, AND TO COME TOGETHER AS
CITIZENS AS PATRIOTS AND AS
AMERICANS.
COME TOGETHER AS AMERICAN.
TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT
TO EVERY CITIZEN WATCHING ALL
ACROSS THE LAND.
AND THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF THOSE
CAMERAS ROLLING, UNFORTUNATELY.
THANK YOU.
IT'S CALLED -- YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S CALLED?
EARNED MEDIA.
AND I EARNED IT.
THAT I WILL TELL YOU.
EARNED MEDIA, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR THE EEFRPED MEDIA.
THIS IS -- EASTERNED MEDIA.
THIS IS YOUR -- EASTERNED MEDIA.
THIS IS YOUR -- EARNED MEDIA.
THIS IS YOUR TIME TO CHOOSE.
WHETHER WE TURN BACKWARD TO THE
FAILURE AND FRUSTRATION OF THE
PAST.
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN FAR
LESS THAN TWO YEARS.
NOBODY BELIEVES IT.
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT.
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO REPORT
IT.
SO WE REPORT IT OURSELVES.
THEY DON'T WANT TO REPORT IT.
BY THE WAY, 15% OF THEM ARE
OKAY.
85%, NO GOOD.
AND IT'S ALSO A CHOICE OF
WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD INTO
THE UNLIMITED PROMISE OF OUR
FUTURE OF THIS GREAT LAND, THIS
GREAT COUNTRY.
WE WERE LOSING OUR COUNTRY.
I'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE COME UP
TO ME, GREAT PEOPLE, SOME OF
THEM STRONG AND TOUGH AND, YOU
KNOW, THESE AREN'T EMOTIONAL
PEOPLE.
AND THEY HAVE TEARS IN THEIR
EYES SAY MR. PRESIDENT -- I SAW
ONE TONIGHT, CAME UP TO ME, A
MAN.
TOUGH COOKIE, WOULDN'T WANT TO
FIGHT HIM, 0 CAY?
AND HE SAID -- OKAY?
AND HE SAID MR. PRESIDENT, HE'S
CRYING, HE SAID THANK YOU FOR
SAVING OUR COUNTRY.
SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT.
SO MANY PEOPLE.
IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA TO
DECIDE OUR FATE.
IT IS NOT UP TO THE POLLSTERS OR
THE PUNDITS, ALTHOUGH OUR POLLS
ARE VERY GOOD RIGHT NOW.
THEY'RE GOING NUTS WITH THAT
ONE.
THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN WE HAVE
GOOD POLLS, SO USUALLY THEY MAKE
UP PHONY POLLS.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
THEY'RE CALLED REPRESSION.
IT'S REPRESSION.
DARLING, YOU KNOW THE STORY.
SAID IT A LOT.
DARLING, I REALLY LIKE DONALD
TRUMP, BUT YOU KNOW, HE CAN'T
WIN BECAUSE CNN DID A POLL.
HEY, DID THOSE POLLS TURN OUT TO
BE WRONG OR WHAT?
BUT IT'S CALLED REPRESSION.
IT'S CALLED REPRESSION.
THEY'RE PHONY POLLS.
JUST LIKE FAKE NEWS, THEY'RE
PHONY FAKE POLLS.
BUT THEY SAID, DARLING, I REALLY
LIKE THAT GUY, BUT THE POLLS SAY
ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE NEWS,
THE MEDIA, BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE
THINK IT'S LEGIT ALTHOUGH THAT'S
CHANGED A VERY LOT, THEY SAID
DARLING, LET'S GO TO A MOVIE,
AND THEN WE'LL COME HOME AND
WATCH OUR FRIEND DONALD.
IT'S SO SAD WHAT'S HAPPENING.
I MEAN AS AN EXAMPLE I HEARD,
DARLING, THAT I HEARD HE'S GOING
TO LOSE TEXAS.
I HEARD HE'S GOING TO LOSE UTAH.
I HEARD HE'S GOING TO LOSE
GEORGIA.
SO SAD.
SO SAD.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHEN TEXAS CAME
OUT AT 8:00 THEY SAID LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED
IN TEXAS AND THE WINNER IS
DONALD TRUMP.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE POLLS
HAVE CLOSED IN THE GREAT STATE
OF UTAH AND THE WINNER IS DONALD
TRUMP.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE POLLS
HAVE CLOSED IN THE GREAT STATE
OF GEORGIA AND THE WINNER IS
DONALD TRUMP.
YOU SEE, IF IT'S CLOSE, THEY
TAKE HOURS AND HOURS AND DAYS.
BUT WHEN YOU WIN IN A LANDSLIDE
THEY DO IT FAST.
I KEPT HEARING HE COULD BE IN
TROUBLE IN TEXAS.
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO HAVE TROUBLE
LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME.
WE LOVE TEXAS.
AND TED CRUZ IS STARTING TO DO
REALLY WELL IN TEXAS NOW.
HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE.
HE'S DOING REALLY WELL.
GOING TO WIN BY A LOT.
HE'S GOING TO WIN BY A LOT.
WAS THAT THE GREATEST EVENING?
TELL ME.
GO BACK ALMOST TWO YEARS.
WAS THAT THE GREATEST EVENING
LIKE EVER?
WAS THAT LIKE THE GREATEST
EVENING?
REMEMBER THE BOARD?
AND BOY THAT SENATE THAT WHOLE
THING A LITTLE BLUE HERE, A
LITTLE BLUE HERE, THE WHOLE
THING IS RED.
AND BY THE END OF THE EVENING,
NICE GUY, JOHN KING, HIS HAND
WAS TREMBLING.
HE SAID, OH, WISCONSIN.
THAT'S BEEN DECADES.
DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE STATE
OF WISCONSIN.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE STATE
OF MICHIGAN.
AND YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE BEHIND
HIM OH NO, OH NO DON'T.
REMEMBER THAT?
REMEMBER PENNSYLVANIA?
PENNSYLVANIA HADN'T BEEN WON FOR
MANY YEARS BY A REPUBLICAN.
GREAT STATE, GREAT PEOPLE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO
WELL THERE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO,
BUT ALL REPUBLICANS THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WELL IN
PENNSYLVANIA.
THEN THEY LOSE.
SO I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO
GREAT IN PENNSYLVANIA, DO YOU
REMEMBER?
THERE WAS 1% OF THE VOTE LEFT.
IF WE LOST EVERY SINGLE VOTE WE
WIN BY A LOT.
THEY REFUSED TO ANNOUNCE IT.
THEY REFUSED.
THEY WAITED UNTIL LIKE, WHAT
TIME?
1:00 IN THE MORNING.
I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, IF I LOST
EVERY SINGLE VOTE I WIN BY A
LOT, ANNOUNCE IT.
THEY WOULDN'T ANNOUNCE IT.
BUT THEY HAD TO ANNOUNCE
WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, SO NOTHING
MATTERED.
HAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT
EVENINGS.
YOU KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE
GREATEST RATED EVENINGS IN THE
HISTORY OF TELEVISION ALL
BECAUSE OF YOU.
THAT WAS A GREAT EVENING FOR ALL
OF US.
AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO
HVE ANOTHER GREAT EVENING IN
NOVEMBER AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET
MARSHA IN THERE BECAUSE THAT'S
SO IMPORTANT.
MARSHA BLACKBURN.
IT'S UP TO YOU TO CHOOSE OUR
FUTURE.
IT'S UP TO YOU TO CHOOSE
PROSPERITY AND PRIDE OVER
SOCIALISM AND DECAY.
IT'S UP TO YOU ON NOVEMBER 6,
RIGHT?
NOVEMBER 6, 2018 LOYAL CITIZENS
LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS
COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER WE ARE
TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRIMENT
WE'RE RETURNING POWER --
COUNTRY.
WE'RE RETURNING POWER TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHAT WE CAMPAIGNED ON.
THIS GREAT STATE, THE STATE OF
TENNESSEE WAS FORGED THROUGH THE
SWEAT AND SACRIFICE OF TOUGH
PIONEER MEN AND WOMEN.
TOUGH PEOPLE.
GOOD GENES YOU HAVE.
GOOD GENES.
THIS IS THE STATE OF DAVEY CROCK
ET AND AN -- CROCKETT AND ANDREW
JACKSON.
ANDREW JACKSON WHO CONTINUES TO
BE ON THE $20 BILL.
YOU KNOW THAT.
ANDREW JACKSON.
THEY ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY
WERE COMPARING WHAT WE DID A
YEAR AND A HALF AGO -- THANK YOU
-- I THINK IT WAS GOOD WHAT HE
SAID.
THEY WERE ALWAYS COMPARING IT TO
RONALD REAGAN.
THEN THEY ACTUALLY STARTED
SAYING, NO, THE ONLY ONE THAT WE
COMPARE THIS WITHIN IS ANDREW
JACKSON -- ONE IS ANDREW
JACKSON.
HE HAD ONE WILD ELECTION.
AND THEN THEY SAY TOWARD THE END
AND THEN WITH A BIG VICTORY THEY
SAY NO THIS WAS ACTUALLY GREATER
THAN EVEN ANDREW JACKSON.
AND I'M A BIG ANDREW JACKSON
FAN.
AND I WENT TO ANDREW JACKSON'S
HOME IN TENNESSEE.
AND IT WAS GREAT.
AND IT WAS SPECIAL.
AND HE WAS A TOUGH COOKIE.
AND HE WAS A GREAT PRESIDENT
TOO.
THIS STATE IS THE HOME TO
GENERAL RAGS OF PROUD AMERICAN
-- GENERATIONS OF PROUD
AMERICANS WHO DEFY DANGERS AND
BRAVE THE ELEMENTS TO DEFEND
THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR COUNTRY,
AND ALWAYS TO DEFEND THEIR
VALUES.
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.
THEY DEFEND THEIR SALES.
THEY DEFEND THEIR FAMILY --
VALUES.
THEY DEFEND THEIR FAMILIES.
WHAT ELSE DO THEY DEFEND ?
THEY DEFEND OUR -- DEFEND?
THEY DEFEND OUR GREAT AMERICAN
FLAG.
THEY DEFEND OUR FLAG.
JUST LIKE THE PIONEERS AND
PATRIOTS WHO CAME BEFORE US, WE
ARE GOING TO WORK.
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT.
AND WE ARE DOING TO WIN WIN WIN.
WE'RE WINNING.
WE'RE WINNING.
WE WILL NOT BEND.
WE WILL NOT BREAK.
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN.
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP.
WE WILL NEVER EVER BACK DOWN
LIKE THESE PEOPLE OVER HERE.
THEY'LL NEVER BACK DOWN.
LIKE HIM.
LIKE HIM.
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER.
AND WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO
VICTORY, VICTORY, VICTORY.
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE
AMERICAN, AND OUR HEARTS BLEED
RED, WHITE, AND BLUE.
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY,
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER
GOD.
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG
AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
THANK YOU TENNESSEE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING THERE
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP IN JOHNSON
CITY, TENNESSEE.
HE'S JUST WRAPPED UP THAT
CAMPAIGN-STYLE RALLY.
HE IS THERE TO TRY AND RALLY
SUPPORT FOR REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN.
HE FINDS HEFRS IN A TIGHT
CONTEST -- HERSELF IN A TIGHT
CONTEST AGAINST FORMER GOVERNOR
PHIL BREDISON.
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF HIS
SPEECH ATTEMPT TO LINK THE
FORMER GOVERNOR TO DEMOCRATS
SAYING THAT ESSENTIALLY HE IS
PART OF THE PARTY OF SCHUMER AND
PELOSI AND MAXINE WATERS.
THE PRESIDENT THERE HITTING
DEMOCRATS ON THE ISSUES OF
IMMIGRATION AND OTHER KIND OF
THAEMS THAT WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE
-- THEMES THAT WE HAVE HEARD
BEFORE IN THESE PARTICULAR
SETTINGS.
AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH, LET'S
BRING IN JOEL, A REPORTER FROM
TENNESSEE.
HE JOINS US FROM NASHVILLE.
WE HAVE WEIJIA JIANG TRAVELING
WITH THE PRESIDENT AS WELL
JOINING US FROM JOHNSON CITY,
TENNESSEE.
WEIJIA, LET ME START WITH YOU.
YOU HAVE ATTENDED A NUMBER OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RALLIES, WHAT
STOOD OUT TO YOU ABOUT HIS
MESSAGE THERE IN TENNESSEE?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK, ELAINE, AS
WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, IT'S ACTUALLY
BECOMING MORE CLEAR THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS EYEING 2020.
AND AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE
MIDTERMS, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH HE
IS REALLY LINKING THESE
CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS WITH A
VOTE FOR HIM.
AND HE HAS SAID AS MUCH TONIGHT
IS NO EXCEPTION SAYING THAT A
VOTE FOR MARSHA BLACKBURN IS A
VOTE FOR ME.
AND TONIGHT MORE THAN THE
PREVIOUS SEVERAL RALLIES, I HAVE
TO SAY IT REALLY FELT LIKE HE
WAS BRINGING UP 2016.
IN FACT, HE TALKED AT LENGTH
ABOUT HOW THE POLLS GOT IT
WRONG.
HE POINTED OUT ALL THE STATES
THAT WENT TO HIM THAT WERE NOT
EXPECTED 20 GO TO HIM.
AND TALK -- TO GO TO HIM AND
TALKED ABOUT HOW GREAT IT WAS
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO WIN DESPITE
WHAT THE NUMBERS HAD PREDICTED.
REMEMBER, HERE WE ARE ALMOST TWO
YEARS IN HIS PRESIDENCY AND HE'S
STILL DWELLING ON THIS, AGAIN,
BECAUSE HE IS RAMPING UP NOT
ONLY FOR THE MIDTERMS, BUT I
BELIEVE FOR 2020.
HE MENTIONED BY NAME POTENTIAL
DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS FOR
PRESIDENT IN 2020.
AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS SURPRISED
ABOUT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE
TIMING OF WHAT A VICTORY HE HAD
THIS MORNING BECAUSE WE JUST SAW
HIM IN THE ROSE GARDEN.
AND EVEN THOUGH TWO MINUTES INTO
THIS RALLY HE DID MENTION THE
NEW NAFTA DEAL, WHICH HE JUST
ANNOUNCED TODAY AT THE WHITE
HOUSE, HE REALLY DIDN'T TALK
ABOUT LENGTH ABOUT IT.
IT WAS JUST SORT OF LIKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT.
THIS HAPPENED TODAY.
THIS IS WHAT I PROMISED AS PART
OF MY CAMPAIGN.
HERE WE ARE.
BUT THEN HE MOVED ON VERY
QUICKLY INSTEAD OF TOUTING IT AS
MUCH AS I EXPECTED.
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT UP JUDGE
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
BUT OVERALL IT WAS SORT OF JUST
CLIFF NOTES OF ALL THE THINGS HE
PROMISED HE WOULD DO THAT HE
BELIEVES ARE BEING ACCOMPLISHED
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS RACE IN
THE MIDTERMS IS SO TIGHT AND SO
CLOSE.
AND HE KNOWS THAT IT DOES HAVE
HUGE IMPACTS ON HIS PRESIDENCY
WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW, BEFORE
OR DURING THE 2020 CAMPAIGN.
>> JOEL, LET'S GET SOME CONTEXT
FROM YOU AS WELL.
SO TENNESSEE, OF COURSE, IS A
RED STATE.
THE PRESIDENT WAS CAMPAIGNING
THERE FOR REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA BLACKBURN.
SHE'S LOOKING TO REPLACE
RETIRING XOP SENATOR BOB CORKER
-- GOP SENATOR BOB CORKER.
IT'S A TIGHT CONTEST AGAINST
FORMER GOVERNOR PHIL BREDISON.
WHY IS THIS RACE SO COMPETITIVE?
>> I THINK JUST LARGELY BECAUSE
OF THE POPULARITY OF PHIL
BREDISON.
A TWO-TIME GOVERNOR, THE LAST
DEMOCRAT TO WIN STATEWIDE.
YOU KNOW, AND THIS HAS REALLY
ENERGIZED FOLKS, HIS CANDIDACY
GOT PEOPLE EXCITED AGAIN IN
TENNESSEE.
TENNESSEE HAS BECOME SO
REPUBLICAN SINCE BREDISON WAS
LAST IN OFFICE IN 2010 THAT HE
IS REALLY KIND OF SEEN AS THE
ONLY PERSON WITH THE PARTY THAT
WOULD STAND A CHANCE AT GIVING
DEMOCRATS A SHOT AT THIS RACE.
SO WITHOUT PHIL BREDISON THIS
RACE WOULDN'T BE THIS CLOSE.
>> SO THEN, JOEL, JUST TO FOLLOW
UP ON THAT NOTION, WHEN THE
PRESIDENT TRIES AS HE DID
TONIGHT TO LINK A PERSON LIKE A
GOVERNOR BREDISON TO THE SORT OF
MORE LIBERAL MEMBERS OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND NATIONAL
FIGURES LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER, LIKE
NANCY PELOSI, HOW DOES THAT LAND
NECESSARILY WITH VOTERS IN
TENNESSEE?
>> WELL, I THINK THERE'S A LOT
OF SKEPTICS.
I MEAN, BREDISON HAS ALWAYS BEEN
SORT OF AN INDEPENDENT MANDED
PERSON.
HE IS NOT -- MINDED PERSON.
HE IS NOT SOMEONE WHO SAYS I'M A
DEMOCRAT SO I'M GOING TO VOTE
WITH THE DEMOCRATS.
HE'S TRIED TO REPEATEDLY SAY
THIS THROUGHOUT HIS CAMPAIGN.
AS FAR AS THE NATIONALIZATION, I
THINK BREDISON TRIED TO UNDERCUT
THAT LAST WEEK DURING A DEBATE
WITH MARSHA BLACKBURN WHERE HE
SAID I'M NOT GOING TO SIDE WITH
CHUCK SCHUMER, AND I'M NOT GOING
TO VOTE AND SUPPORT HIS
CONTINUED LEADERSHIP WITH THE
PARTY.
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS THE
ISSUE THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE
HOPING IT IS AS FAR AS LINKING
BREDISON TO NATIONAL DEMOCRATS.
>> WELL, WEIJIA, PRESIDENT TRUMP
AS YOU MENTIONED DID ADDRESS
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
HE BLAMED THE DELAY IN THE
CONFIRMATION VOTE ON DEMOCRATS.
AND LET'S LISTEN TO SOME OF
THAT.
>> DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO DO
ANYTHING AND TO HURT ANYONE TO
GET THEIR WAY LIKE THEY'RE DOING
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DESTROY
HIM SINCE THE VERY FIRST SECOND
HE WAS ANNOUNCED BECAUSE THEY
KNOW THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL
FOLLOW THE CONSTITUION AS
WRITTEN.
HE'S A GOOD MAN.
GREAT STUDENT, GREAT INTELLECT.
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM ALL OF A
SUDDEN, OH, LET'S GO BACK TO
HIGH SCHOOL.
THEY MAYBE SHOULD GO BEFORE HIGH
SCHOOL.
>> OKAY.
WEIJIA, NOTABLE, THERE WAS NO
MENTION THAT I DETECTED OF
REPUBLICAN SENATOR JEFF FLAKE
WHO ACTUALLY DID CALL FOR THAT
ONE-WEEK PAUSE AND WAS ABLE TO
OBTAIN IT ALONG WITH HIS FELLOW
REPUBLICAN SENATORS, SUSAN
COLLINS, AND LISA MURKOWSKI, BUT
WHAT ELSE DID THE PRESIDENT SAY
ABOUT HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINEE?
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, ELAINE, NO
MENTION OF JEFF FLAKE, AND NO
MENTION OF HIS DECISION.
REMEMBER, HE IS THE ONE THAT
ORDERED THIS FBI INVESTIGATION
ON FRIDAY.
ASK THEN TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE
-- AND THEN TODAY THE WHITE
HOUSE SAID THE FBI IS FREE TO
INTERVIEW WHOEVER THEY WANT THAT
INSTEAD OF PUTTING ANY SORT OF
LIMIT ON THE SCOPE OF THE
INVESTIGATION THAT IT IS NOW UP
TO INVESTIGATORS TO QUESTION
WHOEVER THEY WANT, TO FOCUS ON
WHATEVER SUBJECTS THEY WANT AS
LONG AS THE TIME LIMIT REMAINS
IN PLACE.
EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
THE WITHIN WHO CALLED FOR THEM
TO BEGIN THIS PROBE TO GET SOME
ANSWERS TO FIND SOME FACTS
TONIGHT HE JUST BLAMED THE
DEMOCRATS FOR TRYING TO DESTROY
A FINE PERSON, MAKING THIS JUST
A POLITICAL CONVERSATION AGAIN
INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT HE WOULD
LIKE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THIS
INVESTIGATION AND HE WILL MAKE
UP HIS MIND AFTER THE FBI
RETURNS RESULTS.
AND I THINK, ELAINE, FROM THE
VERY BEGINNING THAT'S WHY IT'S
BEEN CONFUSING TO FOLLOW THE
PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE BLAEFS
ABOUT KAVANAUGH -- BELIEVES
ABOUT KAVANAUGH BECAUSE IT
FLIP-FLOPS DAY TO DAY.
ON THE ONE HAND HE SAID HE
THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE
FBI DOES THEIR WORK AND
INTERVIEWS WHOEVER THEY BELIEVE
IS FIT TO GET SOME ANSWERS, BUT
JUST HOURS LATER BECAUSE THE
CROWD IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
THIS IS THE CORE OF HIS BASE
HE'S TURNING IT INTO A POLITICAL
SITUATION SAYING THAT THIS IS
JUST BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE
TRYING TO OBSTRUCT THE
NOMINATION.
BUT YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN THAT,
HE MOVED ON.
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO SPEND
TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT
KAVANAUGH BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A
POLARIZING ISSUE RIGHT NOW.
AND BHAUZ HE'S AWARE THAT IT'S
-- BECAUSE HE'S AWARE THAT IT'S
NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, BUT SOME
CRITICAL REPUBLICANS THAT HE
NEEDS TO VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH THAT
ARE LISTENING AND WATCHING.
HE KNOWS WHAT THE CROWD HERE
PROBABLY EXPECT HIM TO SAY.
>> AND JOEL, IS THERE ANY WAY TO
TELL MORE BROADLY THERE IN YOUR
STATE, IN TENNESSEE, HOW MUCH
THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION IS
RESONATING AS AN ISSUE WITH
VOTERS?
>> IT REALLY IS KIND OF HARD.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MUCH
POLLING ON THIS.
MARSHA BLACKBURN SAYS, YOU KNOW,
THROUGHOUT HER CAMPAIGNS THAT IT
IS ONE OF THE TOP S THAT SHE
-- TOP ISSUES THAT SHE TALKS
WITH VOTERS ABOUT.
BREDISON HAD A FORUM IN
CHATTANOOGA.
APPARENTLY, ACCORDING TO AN AP
REPORTER WHO WAS THERE, BREDISON
BROUGHT UP HE HADN'T REACHED A
DECISION ON KAVANAUGH YET.
AND AGAIN, ACCORDING TO THE AP
REPORTER HE GOT SOME BOOS FOR
THAT.
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE, THAT
SHOWS, YOU KNOW, AND THIS IS A
PRETTY BREDISON FRIENDLY
AUDIENCE AT THE EVENT I. SHOWS
THAT MAYBE IT'S -- EVENT.
IT SHOWS THAT MAYBE IT'S A
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE PEOPLE CARE
ABOUT.
I'VE TALKED TO SOME LAWMAKERS
AND STATE LAWMAKERS WHO SAY IT
IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR
THIS ELEK.
>> CERTAINLY -- ELECTION.
>> CERTAINLY EMOTIONALLY
CHARGED.
JOEL AND WEIJIA JIANG THANKS TO
YOU BOTH.
APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANKS, ELAINE.
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A
QUICK BREAK.
MUCH MORE NEWS AHEAD.
STAY WITH US.
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
