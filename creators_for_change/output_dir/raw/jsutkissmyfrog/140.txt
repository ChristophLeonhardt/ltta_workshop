00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,439
the publishers of the book A Thousand

2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,480
nights asked me to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a story I</font>

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,820
told them I was sick of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories I tell</font>

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,860
myself lots of ridiculous stories once I

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,960
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself a story about a boy who</font>

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,120
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love me forever in fact I've done</font>

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,770
that story a few times over just with

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,350
different characters and settings when i

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,060
was younger i told myself a story about

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,100
a girl who would grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and never get a</font>

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,579
tattoo every<font color="#E5E5E5"> january i tell myself a</font>

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,100
story about a girl who<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go out every</font>

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,360
morning at 6am and your half-hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> jog</font>

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sheila eat healthy and lose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two stone in</font>

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,020
two months and everything will be

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,030
fabulous that story is particularly

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,600
outlandish and yet I love to tell it I

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,450
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself stories about the future I</font>

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,030
tell myself stories about who I will be

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,220
and then I tell myself those stories so

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,930
often that I get scared by them and I

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,340
stop telling myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> story because I</font>

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,710
start believing my own stories even the

24
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,530
good ones are scary because they seem

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,140
final

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,230
so I try to not tell myself stories or

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,760
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I thought</font>

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,980
then a friend rang me in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of</font>

29
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> night and she needed a story she</font>

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed a story with a good ending so I</font>

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,890
spun her one I spun her one in which her

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,340
family loved her in which she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,480
when she went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place that she</font>

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,610
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and she met people that</font>

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,250
were both terrifyingly stupid and

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,960
brilliantly awesome there were

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,150
devastating moments in the story I'll

38
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,160
give you that but there were high points

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,400
oh there were high points I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> a story</font>

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a girl who built her own family</font>

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">you wandered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through life and bumped</font>

42
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,699
into walls and on the way compared

43
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,840
bruises with the other people next her

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,520
but that character was resilient that

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">character was lively that character was</font>

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,830
relentless that's the bit I don't have

47
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,760
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and soon I realized that</font>

48
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,050
telling stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the only way they</font>

49
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,440
come true telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> stories is really the</font>

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">only way you make truth it's the only</font>

51
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you start to imagine the future it's</font>

52
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,400
the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you start to believe what</font>

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,410
will one day be true

54
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,620
everything's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be okay I changed</font>

55
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,350
my perspective on stories stories can

56
00:02:45,350 --> 00:00:00,000
stay
