“Five quads planned.
He will be opening
with the quad flip.
He’s going to do a
second quad flip here.
Here’s a quad toe,
it looks like.
Another one.
Why not?
Number five.
Yes.”
“I will have to literally
do my dream program,
be super, super clean,
hit all of my quads.
You just have to
set your mind right.
You have to make sure that you
know what you’re attempting.
And then you also need
to know how you’re
going to do it perfectly.”
“Nathan Chen’s body type
is ideal for quads.
He’s very slim from head to toe.
He’s got a great
bounce to his knee,
and his hips are very closed.
So he’s not overly
flexible simply
because if you think
about aerodynamics,
the sewing needle
is going to spin
a lot faster than a pumpkin.”
“When he burst onto the scene
to the masses just a couple
of seasons ago, people
were really down on him
for his artistry.
And I always found his
carriage, his arm positioning,
the way that he emotes and
presents to an audience,
to be very balletic,
very classically trained.”
“As I kind of
progressed into ballet,
I started to understand
the concept of the art
and how pretty and beautiful
all the movement is.
And that definitely
correlates to figure
skating in terms of where you
need to position your body,
how are you going to
position lines, how you’re
going to make yourself look
good, while making it sort of
look effortless.”
“This is a sport that has all
these wonderful technical
elements.
But they’re performed to music.
They’re done as an
entire composition.
So it really is artistry on
ice with athletic feats within.”
“It really is like a moment of
zen when I’m doing my program.
There’s a hush in my body.
I don’t hear anything.
I don’t really feel much.
Occasionally I’ll just notice
certain colors or smells.
I just let myself kind
of go on auto drive.
If I do make a
mistake in my program,
I can really quickly
calculate how much
energy that I have to
redo a certain element.
For instance, if I
fall on a quad lutz,
do I have the energy to
do another quad lutz later
in the program?
Do I have an energy to
replace that with a toe?
Do I have the energy to
just let all that go and do
a triple lutz instead?”
“It’s all very complicated.
But bottom line is
that the judging system
has gone so far into
‘mathletics’ and adding up
all of the elements that you’re
doing that the art of figure
skating is lost.
But if Nathan Chen
does five or six quads,
blows the roof off the
arena in Pyeongchang,
who knows what can happen?”
