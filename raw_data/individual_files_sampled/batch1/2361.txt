I've been homeless since 2011 I worked at metlife Sun Life Assurance about a year or three before I got fired I was coming home and I seen these giant billboards in my neighborhood that they were going to build condominiums so when these condominiums got completed the rent in my neighborhood without automatically kind of priced out the neighborhood it has to be it remember port 8080 so we're trying to add it every day for four months I would see this guy on the way to work yeah he had to ask him a question of whether or not he wanted to do things differently kind of came to my mind the question is a you know do you want me to give you a hundred dollars or I will do my best to teach him to code or not on a super cheap you know use laptop I figured you know if I take the hundred bucks I'm gonna spin net and we done with that in a couple of days a week if I learn the coding classes this could last a lifetime so I overnighted this from Amazon after he decided to code and it was there the next day with the first of the three JavaScript flow so every time it's making a request I expressed to Patrick my concern about climate change and global warming and he suggested that if you build an app in relation to a Google woman people could buy that and this would somehow help to printing what your writers variable is that we start with 15 minutes of update on what he's covered already we head to a website called nitrous IO which is where he manages his server and review the code that he did yesterday the next 15 minutes is in-depth fast repetition of all the things we've covered so far then we do kind of a 30-minute session of whatever is today's topic so remember we talked about scope the frustrating part about the coding process is learning the language of JavaScript we have we have like a file we write code 50 70 times and a data 15 would be to write actually charges the computer at a pretty expensive high-rise building but the people are very nice in conserving and don't mind ok nicer here's the problem now check this out a bunch of people are accessing your app look what's happening there is a lot of need that became apparent through this and I would love to get the tools necessary to help some of these individuals and get them some of the information they're looking for regarding coding and opportunity this thing about being homeless it doesn't have to be a negative that everybody just assumes at all like these homeless like that's kind of suck no no life can still be good even if you're homeless I don't need a million dollars to be happy or to live in your giant penthouse but I do the oxygen I need fresh water and I need a stable environment getting this mobile app completed and spreading awareness of climate change would be a great benefit
