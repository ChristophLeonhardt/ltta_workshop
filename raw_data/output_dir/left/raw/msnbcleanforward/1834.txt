00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:24,183
POLICY? NOCOLLUSION, NO COLLUSION.

168
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,419
NOCOLLUSION, NO COLLUSION. >> WE SHOULDN’T BE THINKING OF

169
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:27,987
>> WE SHOULDN’T BE THINKING OF HIM IN LEGAL TERMS.

170
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:29,622
HIM IN LEGAL TERMS. HE IS ALL ABOUT THE PUBLIC

171
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:30,690
HE IS ALL ABOUT THE PUBLIC RELATIONS BATTLE.

172
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,525
RELATIONS BATTLE. HE IS THE ATTACK DOG FILLING THE

173
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:33,393
HE IS THE ATTACK DOG FILLING THE AIR WAVES.

174
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:36,195
AIR WAVES. THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A DELIBERATE

175
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,597
THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A DELIBERATE STEP THAT WE HAVE SEEN, AS YOU

176
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,334
STEP THAT WE HAVE SEEN, AS YOU TRACED THERE, SINCE 2016.

177
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:43,937
TRACED THERE, SINCE 2016. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.

178
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:45,806
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. AND YET SUDDENLY TODAY WE HAVE

179
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:48,140
AND YET SUDDENLY TODAY WE HAVE GIULIANI TRYING A NEW LINE

180
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,343
GIULIANI TRYING A NEW LINE SUGGESTING THAT, WELL, EVEN IF

181
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,412
SUGGESTING THAT, WELL, EVEN IF THERE WERE COLLUSION THAT’S NOT

182
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,314
THERE WERE COLLUSION THAT’S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT DIDN’T GET

183
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:54,647
A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT DIDN’T GET ANYWHERE.

184
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,349
ANYWHERE. NOTHING HAPPENED.

185
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,618
NOTHING HAPPENED. I THINK THAT I WILL DEFER TO MY

186
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:00,553
I THINK THAT I WILL DEFER TO MY LEGAL COLLEAGUES ON THE SET --

187
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:02,655
LEGAL COLLEAGUES ON THE SET -- >> I’M ABOUT TO.

188
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:05,024
>> I’M ABOUT TO. >> IN TERMS OF WHETHER THAT IS

189
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:05,358
>> IN TERMS OF WHETHER THAT IS TRUE.

190
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:06,826
TRUE. I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM

191
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:09,362
I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM GIULIANI IS TWO THINGS HAPPENED

192
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:09,696
GIULIANI IS TWO THINGS HAPPENED TODAY.

193
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:12,665
TODAY. HE GIVES US THE MYSTERIOUS OTHER

194
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:13,833
HE GIVES US THE MYSTERIOUS OTHER TRUMP TOWER MEETING.

195
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:15,435
TRUMP TOWER MEETING. PEOPLE I TALKED TO TODAY DON’T

196
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,837
PEOPLE I TALKED TO TODAY DON’T KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT

197
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,273
KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT AND THEY ARE CERTAINLY

198
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:20,673
AND THEY ARE CERTAINLY FRUSTRATED.

199
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,175
FRUSTRATED. THESE ARE TRUMP ADVISERS WHO

200
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,711
THESE ARE TRUMP ADVISERS WHO WONDER WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE?

201
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,679
WONDER WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE? WAS HE TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF

202
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,180
WAS HE TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF THE STORY?

203
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:28,448
THE STORY? THERE WAS A REPORT COMING AND HE

204
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,885
THERE WAS A REPORT COMING AND HE WAS TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF IT.

205
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,788
WAS TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF IT. IT FEELS LIKE AN UNFORCED ERROR.

206
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:37,324
IT FEELS LIKE AN UNFORCED ERROR. WHEN SUDDENLY HE LAUNCHED INTO

207
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,459
WHEN SUDDENLY HE LAUNCHED INTO REVELATIONS ABOUT THE STORMY

208
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:42,062
REVELATIONS ABOUT THE STORMY DANIELS PAYMENTS THAT TOOK

209
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:43,897
DANIELS PAYMENTS THAT TOOK HANNITY BY SURPRISE AND SENT THE

210
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,499
HANNITY BY SURPRISE AND SENT THE WHITE HOUSE INTO A TAIL SPIN

211
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,401
WHITE HOUSE INTO A TAIL SPIN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE

212
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:47,735
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE MEANT.

213
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:49,302
MEANT. GIULIANI HAD TO WALK THAT BACK.

214
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:52,005
GIULIANI HAD TO WALK THAT BACK. AS MUCH AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES

215
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,808
AS MUCH AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES HIM OUT THERE, HE LIKES HIM

216
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:58,111
HIM OUT THERE, HE LIKES HIM MUDDYING THE WATERS, IT IS HIS

217
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:01,381
MUDDYING THE WATERS, IT IS HIS ANSWER TO MICHAEL COHEN, HE

218
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:02,716
ANSWER TO MICHAEL COHEN, HE WANTS SOMEONE OUT THERE TO MUDDY

219
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,218
WANTS SOMEONE OUT THERE TO MUDDY THE WATERS.

220
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:07,455
THE WATERS. WE HAVE SEEN MUELLER’S APPROVAL

221
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:08,422
WE HAVE SEEN MUELLER’S APPROVAL RATING DROP.

222
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,225
RATING DROP. GIULIANI HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE

223
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:11,559
GIULIANI HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE THERE.

224
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:13,827
THERE. IT HAS RAISED CONCERNS AGAIN

225
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,463
IT HAS RAISED CONCERNS AGAIN WHETHER GIULIANI IS TOO OFTEN

226
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:18,031
WHETHER GIULIANI IS TOO OFTEN AHEAD OF HIS SKIS AND CAUSING

227
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,633
AHEAD OF HIS SKIS AND CAUSING MORE TROUBLE THAN HE IS HELPING.

228
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,835
MORE TROUBLE THAN HE IS HELPING. >> AS THE FORMER FED HERE AT THE

229
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:24,738
>> AS THE FORMER FED HERE AT THE TABLE, HOW DO THE FEDS VIEW THE

230
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:25,973
TABLE, HOW DO THE FEDS VIEW THE DAY THAT RUDY GIULIANI HAD AND

231
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,042
DAY THAT RUDY GIULIANI HAD AND ALL THAT HE SAID ON TELEVISION?

232
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,943
ALL THAT HE SAID ON TELEVISION? >> I THINK AS A PROSECUTOR I’M

233
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,144
>> I THINK AS A PROSECUTOR I’M SEEING THIS AND I’M SEEING A

234
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,680
SEEING THIS AND I’M SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF PANIC FROM THE

235
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,316
LITTLE BIT OF PANIC FROM THE PRESIDENT AND FROM RUDY

236
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:35,649
PRESIDENT AND FROM RUDY GIULIANI.

237
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:36,984
GIULIANI. I HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE WHEN A

238
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,552
I HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE WHEN A DEFENDANT AND A DEFENSE TEAM

239
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:39,987
DEFENDANT AND A DEFENSE TEAM STARTS TO FEEL THE FACTS AND THE

240
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,356
STARTS TO FEEL THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE CLOSING IN ON THEM AND

241
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:43,858
EVIDENCE CLOSING IN ON THEM AND FEELING LIKE THERE IS NOWHERE

242
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:45,659
FEELING LIKE THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO YOU WILL SEE A CHANGE

243
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:46,727
ELSE TO GO YOU WILL SEE A CHANGE IN TONE.

244
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,362
IN TONE. WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING?

245
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,966
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING? WE ARE LEARNING MORE AND MORE

246
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:53,234
WE ARE LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT WHAT MICHAEL COHEN KNOWS.

247
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:54,835
ABOUT WHAT MICHAEL COHEN KNOWS. WE KNOW THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

248
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:58,372
WE KNOW THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT HAS SUBPOENAED THE LONG TIME

249
00:07:58,415 --> 00:07:58,772
HAS SUBPOENAED THE LONG TIME ACCOUNTANT.

250
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:01,009
ACCOUNTANT. WE WILL HEAR THE WITNESSES IN

251
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:03,778
WE WILL HEAR THE WITNESSES IN THE MANAFORT CASE INCLUDING RICK

252
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:04,078
THE MANAFORT CASE INCLUDING RICK GATES.

253
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:05,813
GATES. YOU CAN SEE THE PANIC SETTING

254
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:06,080
YOU CAN SEE THE PANIC SETTING IN.

255
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:07,782
IN. THE BIG TELL IS WHEN THEY LASHED

256
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:11,085
THE BIG TELL IS WHEN THEY LASHED OUT AT THE MUELLER TEAM.

257
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:11,953
OUT AT THE MUELLER TEAM. THIS IS RIGHT --

258
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:15,389
THIS IS RIGHT -- >> IT’S PERSONAL.

259
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,057
>> IT’S PERSONAL. >> IT’S PERSONAL AND NOTHING

260
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:17,358
>> IT’S PERSONAL AND NOTHING NEW.

261
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,492
NEW. WHEN EVERYTHING IS COMING UP

262
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,761
WHEN EVERYTHING IS COMING UP AGAINST YOU TRY TO PUT THE

263
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:21,462
AGAINST YOU TRY TO PUT THE PROSECUTION ON TRIAL.

264
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:23,497
PROSECUTION ON TRIAL. I HAVE HAD IT DONE TO ME.

265
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,500
I HAVE HAD IT DONE TO ME. EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN A

266
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,201
EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN A PROSECUTOR HAS HAD IT DONE TO

267
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:27,501
PROSECUTOR HAS HAD IT DONE TO THEM.

268
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:28,937
THEM. WHEN YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT LASH

269
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,172
WHEN YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT LASH OUT AT MUELLER AND THE TEAM,

270
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,774
OUT AT MUELLER AND THE TEAM, KNOW THAT THAT IS COMING, I

271
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:34,409
KNOW THAT THAT IS COMING, I BELIEVE THAT IS COMING FROM A

272
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:36,010
BELIEVE THAT IS COMING FROM A POINT OF WEAKNESS AND PANIC.

273
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,745
POINT OF WEAKNESS AND PANIC. WHEN PEOPLE PANIC THEY START

274
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,212
WHEN PEOPLE PANIC THEY START SELF-DEFEATING.

275
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:40,680
SELF-DEFEATING. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT RUDY

276
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,617
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT RUDY GIULIANI SORT OF UNEXPECTEDLY

277
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,685
GIULIANI SORT OF UNEXPECTEDLY SAID TODAY AND WALKED BACK ARE

278
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:45,920
SAID TODAY AND WALKED BACK ARE REALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE

279
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,320
REALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE PRESIDENT.

280
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:48,690
PRESIDENT. >> ANITA, YOU ARE THE CLOSEST TO

281
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:48,990
>> ANITA, YOU ARE THE CLOSEST TO THIS.

282
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,925
THIS. THE VIEW UP HERE IN NEW YORK, AS

283
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:52,527
THE VIEW UP HERE IN NEW YORK, AS YOU HAVE HEARD, IS THAT IT WAS A

284
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,831
YOU HAVE HEARD, IS THAT IT WAS A DAY OF CONFUSION AT MINIMUM.

285
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:59,734
DAY OF CONFUSION AT MINIMUM. IS ANYONE OF THE VIEW THAT IT IS

286
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:00,602
IS ANYONE OF THE VIEW THAT IT IS HELPFUL

287
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:00,935
HELPFUL HELPFUL?

288
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:01,669
HELPFUL? >> MAYBE THE PRESIDENT.

289
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:02,637
>> MAYBE THE PRESIDENT. IF THE PRESIDENT DIDN’T THINK

290
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,139
IF THE PRESIDENT DIDN’T THINK THAT RUDY GIULIANI WAS THE RIGHT

291
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:06,074
THAT RUDY GIULIANI WAS THE RIGHT GUY TO BE OUT THERE HE PROBABLY

292
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,241
GUY TO BE OUT THERE HE PROBABLY WOULDN’T BE OUT THERE.

293
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:08,610
WOULDN’T BE OUT THERE. WHAT YOU ALL SAID BEFORE IS

294
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,644
WHAT YOU ALL SAID BEFORE IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

295
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:11,446
EXACTLY RIGHT. I HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO

296
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:12,847
I HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS WHO

297
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,749
THE WHITE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS WHO ARE SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD AND

298
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,184
ARE SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD AND SAYING THIS IS NOT HELPFUL AND

299
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:17,452
SAYING THIS IS NOT HELPFUL AND THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THEY ARE

300
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:18,853
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THEY ARE NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON.

301
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:21,456
NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON. REMEMBER, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT

302
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:22,324
REMEMBER, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

303
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,459
HAPPENED LAST TIME. THE WHITE HOUSE SAID ON THE

304
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:26,027
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID ON THE STORMY DANIELS ISSUE THAT RUDY

305
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,162
STORMY DANIELS ISSUE THAT RUDY GIULIANI HAD TWO DIFFERENT

306
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,463
GIULIANI HAD TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS ABOUT THAT THEY DIDN’T

307
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:29,798
VERSIONS ABOUT THAT THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH

308
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:30,565
KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THAT, EITHER.

309
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:33,101
THAT, EITHER. IF THIS IS A STRATEGY IT IS ONE

310
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:39,074
IF THIS IS A STRATEGY IT IS ONE THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KBOI ABOUT.

311
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:40,542
THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KBOI ABOUT. RUDY GIULIANI IS OUT THERE.

312
00:09:40,585 --> 00:00:00,000
RUDY GIULIANI IS OUT THERE. HE IS BRASH.
