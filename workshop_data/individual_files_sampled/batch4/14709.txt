Airbnb is bad who says Airbnb is bad would you believe it those who compete against Airbnb much like ride-sharing services such as uber or lyft anywhere Airbnb operates it ends up with a fight on its hands Airbnb is a service that allows people who have houses condos or cottages to rent to people who need accommodation it's all about the free market as my business analyst friend Lou skeezers likes to say happy capitalism the likes of uber and lyft always get blowback from the crappy cabby sector and those politicians who are in the pockets of the taxi industry as for Airbnb it is also running into resistance from believe it or not the hospitality sector the latest outrage group to vent about Airbnb is an organization which represents lodge owners in Manitoba called the Manitoba lodges and Outfitters Association it is calling for new regulations and standards in the province for people who rent out their homes and cottages through sites like Airbnb and to get its message out it asked member businesses last weekend to participate in a one-day strike now just think about the logic in that for just a second say I was someone looking for accommodation at a Manitoban lodge last Saturday only to be told that the inventory had been taken off the market as a way of protesting Airbnb all righty then what would I have to do to get a roof over my head that night well the Manitoba lodges Association has effectively forced me to make arrangements with Airbnb what a brilliant strategy this association conducts a protest in which they force customers to embrace the service that they're protesting against for some reason I don't think Stephen Hawking is running the Manitoba lodges and Outfitters Association it's no different than those cities in which the cab companies took their cabs off the road to protest uber thereby not only forcing people in need of a ride to use uber but also generate millions of dollars in awareness about uber for those who had never heard of uber thereby increasing goobers customer base brilliant as the old saying goes the only constant is change if I want to sublet my car or my abode then so be it the tech exists to facilitate that now but the traditional players who are used to having a monopoly or an oligopoly on these services are still living in yesterday Kade kicking and screaming about the realities of the 21st century and the sharing economy there's also a degree of entitlement at play here by these traditional industries along the lines that they're older living because well it was always thus this is what I call Mustard economics check it out look what is the first thing you buy in a baseball game hot dog hot dog mm-hmm mercer goes with a hot dog that was mine my sid was made for that dog now look I don't like mustard mustard isn't a hot dog go together I'm gonna get her out of my splendor my romance do you know they spend millions of dollars every year to put up factories just to manufacture mustard do you know those factories employ thousands and thousands of men just to manufacture mustard you know those men take care of thousands of families and homes all on account of mustard and you just because you didn't like mustard what do you want them to do close those factories down put all those people out of brick yeah the people who represent the taxi and hospitality business are beholden to mustard economics theory which is to say even if the consumer doesn't like the established industries the consumer nevertheless should support those industries because hey people in those industries need to make a living whether their service has desired or not it's not what's right for you as the consumer but what's right for them as the provider but mustard economics doesn't work when it comes to condiments and what the likes of the Manitoba lodges association needs to realize is that it also won't work for them either for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has an all-new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
