for the rebel that media I'm Ezra Levant standing in the heart of London outside the Old Bailey otherwise known as the Central Criminal Courts there is a crowd of people even more than an hour after Tommy's hearing was over at least a thousand people I've never been in such a crush before many Jets you can hear them right now and I'm pleased to say that a fellow rebel alumnus Gavin McInnes has come to London Gavin great to see you great to see you as a it's great to see you but we are here for an unhappy reason our friend Tommy Robinson is in court for what the fourth time now just for doing what in America or Canada would be called citizen journalism yeah he's doing his trial twice now for contempt of court they delayed it we're in the biggest court of the land the Old Bailey where they deal with rapists and murderers I can't stand all these fans I at least ant if I just punch you and run away the fans aren't just fans they're deeply thoughtful people following Tommy's case yes it is is a rockstar welcome for Tommy but but that rockstars welcome is shallow and fashion-oriented these people although the case inside out Gavin good point good point they're here for deeper reasons in fashion yes the fandom is Beatlemania here we're almost crushed going into the court and I I don't understand what they want out of him these fans like are they gonna squish him to death my view is the last line he's the last guy fighting in the UK now you are British extraction but you're really an American Canadian are you do you think the UK has lost its traditional freedoms it used to be the mother country when it came to freedom Magna Carta John Milton and we lost that over here yes and I think it's because there's a massive split now in Britain there's the media class the middle class the upper class and the working class and the upper class despised the working class with so much vitriol it's disturbing do you think this is a class thing you don't think it's a political correct thing political correctness is a class thing it's the upper classes telling the lower classes how to think how to talk how to behave it's all about controlling the working class are there no highfalutin folks like Lord Pearson of ironic he's a appear in the House of Lords he supports Tommy and I guess I've just listed them all yeah you really have this is nothing to do with Tommy it has nothing to do with Islam it has to do with the upper classes fear of a working class upheaval I think you're reducing it a bit but I'll accept your point of view I want to I want to say why I think it's important that you hear first of all it's nice that we have another rebel alumnus here but what's frustrated me is how few mainstream media in North America have covered this Tucker Carlson interviewed Tommy the night he got out of prison that was excellent but that was once for eight minutes no one else from North America and I love Breitbart comm they've got an office in London I haven't seen Breitbart UK here I haven't seen the Telegraph I haven't seen The Spectator where are the conservative journalists who who should who should adore or support or at least report on Tommy where's everybody else Gavin they're the same reason the police won't report on these they're scared of being seen as racist Burt calm afraid you know through a Drudge Report I mean come on they're not afraid are they or do they just not understand well I think with a lot of American media it is it's just ignorance of what goes on in another country in another part of the world but with we're scared because the first time I heard the name Tommy Robinson I was told he was a racist I was told he was all these things and I was nervous because I thought I don't want to hang out with a guy who's a nice man I remember my first interview I said what do you say what do you think of the Jews and I was scared because of the poisoning the well the mainstream media poisoned the well and I had to work hard to get through that before I could discover the real Tommy yeah well the real Tommy's right there for anyone to see in fact he's sitting there talking to anyone who wants to talk to him right now so I'm worried about that I'm worried he's going to suffer a physical harm because he's so he's so important an icon and a man I am worried Samantha thug or some Islamist thug is going to put a knife in him well there was a group of Islamist thugs who came to get him with explosives guns knives a letter to the Queen and they were caught because they made a mistake with their rent oh and they filled out the insurance wrong that's why they would the police pulled them over they went to court that all those guys are in jail for 30 years Tommy yelled god save the queen' after he was after they found those guys guilty it's the same judge today you know um it's funny the police today I have to say they kept the peace they kept the order and they escorted Tommy out fairly safely I think but I have to say that the police as an institution the prisons as an institution I'm not talking about the rank and file I'm talking about the brass I think they want Tommy dead just as much as the heart left and the islamists that's why they threw him in a prison where it was in extreme danger beyond the shadow of a doubt and I always say to quote NWA the police his boss it's the apostrophe s boss you got to include in that the man on the ground the beat cops they're not the villains here but the top brass that like the magistrate who was who was smirking when he was looking down at Tommy getting arrested he was smirking well I don't want to keep because I know you got your own work to do here and I like hey hey this is this is the people we're in the middle of a thousand person rally it's gonna happen my last question for you are you going to go back to America and use your connections and influence and your own podium to take up this case and be a be an advocate for Tommy in the United States yes and I always have been I think that America does not have a serious Islam problem yet but if this Britain is a canary in a coal mine and Tommy Robinson is any indication of what we're facing we need to nip this in the bud in alright well I'm gonna hold you to that I expect you to cover every step of Tommy's trial and I expect you to become a bit of a Tommie maniac and what I mean by that is someone who won't change his mind and won't change the subject which reminds me the Mets this year are having an incredible season we like degrom Oz get headed to the siyoung award listen you have eaten from the fruit of the tree of knowledge now you know what's going on you have a moral obligation to be an advocate I'm just saying that a lot of you Jews start to sound like Moses when you get that's it old tents the Old Testament listen you're one of the good guys Gavin you're a little bit prickly when it comes to the people for someone who's poking at the aristocracy for being too fancy-pants you got well look at how fancy you are you're a snappy dresser I'm becoming a classes today Gavin McInnes great to see you tell our viewers where they can find
