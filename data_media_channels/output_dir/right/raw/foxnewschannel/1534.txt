STAND WITH THEM.

4
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:08,881
AND THAT'S THE "ANGLE."

5
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,450
LET'S BRING BACK NEWT GINGRICH

LOTS?

10
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,758
>> I THINK THAT REPUBLICANS ARE

11
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:22,995
LIKELY TO GAIN 4-6 SEATS IN THE

12
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:23,329
SENATE.

13
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,364
>> Laura: WE ARE HEARING THEY

14
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:26,799
COULD LOSE THE MAJORITY IN THE

15
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:27,133
SENATE.

16
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:29,469
SIX MONTHS AGO.

17
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,171
>> I DO A NEWSLETTER THAT GOES

00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:35,942
TWO WEEKS AGO I WROTE EVERYBODY

PRESIDENCY ARE THE SAME PEOPLE

26
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:47,653
WHO ARE ON TV RIGHT NOW.

27
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:49,422
WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE ANY OF

28
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:49,722
THEM?

29
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:50,790
>> Laura: BUT STEVE SCHMIDT

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,557
HAS BEEN SO RIGHT.

31
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:54,327
AND ALL THAT OVER THE YEARS.

32
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:58,264
I SAY FACETIOUSLY.

33
00:00:58,264 --> 00:00:59,265

HEADS HAVE A BIAS OF GETTING

36
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,669
TOGETHER AND SAYING THIS IS

37
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:04,269
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

38
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,572
IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT AND I

39
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,975
LOOKED AT THAT BOWL TODAY FROM

40
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:16,048
REUTERS, REPUBLICANS ARE UP ONE

41
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:16,749
WHERE THEY USED TO BE DOWN TEN

42
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:17,049
OR 11.

43
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:17,683
>> Laura: 15 AT ONE TIME.

44
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:19,252
>> I WOULD BEGIN TO PANIC.

45
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:21,220
BECAUSE IF THE REPUBLICANS ARE

46
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,689
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO EVEN ON THE

47
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,690
GENERIC, THEY COULD CONCEIVABLY

48
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,091
GAIN SEATS.

49
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,058
>> Laura: DOESN'T IMPEACHMENT

50
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:29,228
THE DEMOCRATS?

51
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:29,562
>> YES.

52
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:31,364
>> Laura: BECAUSE THE

53
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:34,267
REPUBLICANS, THESE CROWDS AT

54
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,668
THESE RALLIES FOR TERM.

55
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:36,402
PEOPLE THINK IMPEACHMENT, THEY

56
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:38,471
WILL GO TO THE POLLS.

57
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,539
I HOPE THAT GUY SAYS THE

58
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,273
IMPEACHMENT -- I THOUGHT IT WAS

59
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:45,044
ALL GREEN.

60
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:46,846
HE SAID WE ARE GOING TO IMPEACH

61
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:47,647
THE PRESIDENT.

62
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:48,447
THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE

63
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,249
REPUBLICANS RIGHT TO THE POLLS.

64
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:51,350
DEMOCRATS, SOME OF THEM KNOW

65
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,051
THAT.

66
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,286
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE TRUMP

67
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:53,686
SUPPORTERS.

68
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:55,888
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WHO IS NOT

69
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:56,656
DEEPLY POLITICAL ONCE THE SYSTEM

70
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:57,056
TO WORK.

71
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:58,124
THEY LOVE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

72
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:00,760
THE ECONOMY.

73
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,728
THEY LOVE THE FACT WE HAVE THE

74
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:03,696
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN

75
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,298
MODERN TIMES.

76
00:02:05,298 --> 00:02:06,666
THEY THINK IT'S TERRIFIC.

77
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,267
GALLUP JUST REPORTED 65% OF THE

78
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:09,068
COUNTRY THINKS THAT YOU CAN GET

79
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,871
A GOOD JOB.

80
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:12,872
HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE THEY BEGAN

81
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:16,375
TAKING THAT QUESTION.

82
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,311
DEMOCRATS VOTED NO ON THE TAX

83
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:19,378
CUTS AND WOULD NOW LIKE TO

84
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:22,281
TOTALLY SCREW UP THE ECONOMY BY

85
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,149
CHASING AN IMPEACHMENT ON A

86
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:25,117
TOPIC THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE

87
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:25,851
ANY SUBSTANCE.

88
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:26,686
>> Laura: THEY GOT PRISON

89
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,187
REFORM PASSED THROUGH THE HOUSE

90
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:28,487
TODAY.

91
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,122
THAT'S HUGE BIPARTISAN ISSUE.

92
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:32,325
HUGE BIPARTISAN ISSUE THAT WILL

93
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:35,461
LIKELY PASS THE SENATE.

94
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,662
PART OF THE DODD-FRANK REPEALED.

95
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:37,463
THAT'S HAPPENING.

96
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,465
ALL THESE JUDGES, 21 JUDGES ON

97
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:40,700
THE CIRCUIT COURTS GETTING

98
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,300
THROUGH.

99
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,668
THIS IS GOOD STUFF.

100
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:44,971
>> USE A REALLY UNUSUAL THINGS.

101
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:48,874
YOU END UP LOOKING AT VAN JONES,

102
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:50,276
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT, SHOWS UP AT

103
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:51,110
THE WHITE HOUSE AS PART OF

104
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,646
PRISON REFORM.

105
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:54,947
SOMETHING YOU COULDN'T HAVE SEEN

106
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:55,448
A YEAR AGO.

107
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,049
>> Laura: I THINK THE

108
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:57,750
KANYE WEST EFFECT IS SOMETHING

109
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,819
WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN FULLY

110
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,186
EFFECTIVE.

111
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:02,021
>> SECOND EXAMPLE.

112
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,291
KANYE WEST WITHIN THREE DAYS,

113
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,592
BLACK SUPPORT APPROVAL OF TRUMP

114
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:09,929
DRAWN FROM 11 TO 22.

115
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,197
>> Laura: HOW MUCH OF AN

116
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:12,632
INCREASE IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN

117
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:16,235
SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT OR THE

118
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:16,836
REPUBLICAN AGENDA WOULD

119
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:19,839
DEVASTATE THE DEMOCRATS?

120
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:22,475
>> FIVE OR EIGHT OR 9% WOULD BE

121
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:23,242
DEVASTATING.

122
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:24,043
IF THE REPUBLICANS EVER GET TO

123
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,178
20% OF THE BLACK VOTE IT IS

124
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:28,414
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE

125
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:30,483
DEMOCRATS TO SURVIVE.

126
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:31,117
>> Laura: THEY ARE TRULY

127
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,352
PETRIFIED OF THAT.

128
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:35,121
RACISM, RACISM, RACISM.

129
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:37,857
IDENTITY POLITICS.

130
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:38,257
>> RIGHT.

131
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:38,958
AND AT THE SAME TIME WHAT YOU

132
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,660
HAVE IS A PRESIDENT WHO CAN SAY

133
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,063
ABSOLUTELY ACCURATELY THIS IS

134
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:45,097
THE BEST SITUATION IN BLACK

135
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:47,033
UNEMPLOYMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY

136
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:47,700
UNEMPLOYMENT IN AMERICAN HISTOR

137
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,034
HISTORY.

138
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:48,567
NEVER BEEN LOWER.

139
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,302
>> Laura: DON'T YOU THINK IT'S

140
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:50,703
A GREAT TIME TO BE AN AMERICAN

141
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,270
RIGHT NOW?

142
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,872
IF YOU ARE IN BUSINESS.

143
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:53,873
LOTS OF STUFF HAPPENING IN THE

144
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:55,574
CULTURE I'M NOT WILD ABOUT BUT

145
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:56,242
AS FAR AS ECONOMIC

146
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:56,676
OPPORTUNITIES.

147
00:03:56,676 --> 00:03:59,178
GOOD TIME.

148
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:00,946
>> A WHOLE RANGE OF INNOVATION.

149
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:03,449
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

150
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,550
GET EVERY EIGHTH GRADER

151
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,086
SEPTEMBER TO UNDERSTAND

152
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,454
LITERALLY THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO

153
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:09,155
GO TO THE MOON, THEY HAVE A

154
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,257
CHANCE TO GO TO MARS.

155
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:13,292
THE WORLD, THIS STUFF IS

156
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:14,093
CHANGING SO FAST.

157
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:15,695
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TO HAVE A SENSE

158
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:17,129
THEY ARE GOING TO LIVE ONE OF

159
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:19,130
THE MOST EXCITING GENERATIONS IN

160
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,334
HISTORY AND THAT COULD BE PART

161
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,235
OF TRUMP'S GREATEST LEGACY.

162
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:24,670
>> Laura: OPTIMISM AND

163
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,304
POSITIVITY.

164
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:26,005
PELOSI AND SCHUMER, ONE MORE

165
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:29,241
SELL ON THE BETTER DEAL MODEL,

166
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:29,675
LET'S WATCH.

167
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,478
>> YOU ARE MEAN.

168
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:33,245
>> INSTEAD OF DELIVERING ON HIS

169
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:36,782
PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP,

170
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:38,818
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME THE

171
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:41,887
SWAMP.

172
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,055
REPUBLICANS AND THE CORRUPT BIG

173
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:44,857
DONOR AGENDA TO GET OUT OF THE

174
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:45,291
WAY.

175
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,660
IT HAS GIVEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

176
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,861
A RAW DEAL.

177
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:49,862
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHEN IT

178
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:50,596
COMES TO DRAINING THE SWAMP HAS

179
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:54,200
BEEN A COMPLETE AND TOTAL

180
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,834
DISAPPOINTMENT.

181
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,369
THE SWAMP HAS NEVER BEEN MORE

182
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,738
FOUL OR MORE FITTED THAN UNDER

183
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,673
THIS PRESIDENT.

184
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:02,241
>> Laura: I KNOW YOU LOVE THE

185
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,209
FACT THEY USE THE WORD FETID.

186
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,210
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

187
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,046
THINKING.

188
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:08,881
>> THE DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT THE

189
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:10,049
SWAMP, IT'S AN ANONYMOUS

190
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,250
