00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
hi friends so for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10th birthday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> party</font>

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,589
my friends came<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and we had a Dairy</font>

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,230
Queen ice cream cake I open presents and

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,420
then my parents herded us all on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,179
back porch to grab a red solo cup each

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,880
fill it in with a scoop of dirt make a

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,220
hole to the first knuckle of our index

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">finger and drop in a few carrot seeds it</font>

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,689
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun to watch the little</font>

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,180
green top sprout up saying hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,250
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a wonderful</font>

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,920
carrot but maybe from some too eager

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,710
watering or just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having enough space</font>

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,899
and being choked up in that plastic cup

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,450
before it could ever become a delicious

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,820
root vegetable it's tripled up and died

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,129
in other news I recently made a

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,950
temporary move from my job that<font color="#CCCCCC"> requires</font>

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,809
me to spend the next half a dozen months

20
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a city in the desert that I'd never</font>

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,660
even visited before a week ago got here

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,480
and I unpacked my air mattress and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sat</font>

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,660
in this little concrete cube alone with

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,879
the pictures falling off my wall because

25
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,239
the tape wouldn't stick the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gang where</font>

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,360
the hell am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and what have I done it's</font>

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,620
not the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I've done zone</font>

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,640
like this but it never gets easier maybe

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,680
it gets more difficult every time but

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,480
whenever I find myself some way new I

31
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,850
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we all get told</font>

32
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,280
by our first<font color="#E5E5E5"> grade teachers right bloom</font>

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,740
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're planted it's a thing they</font>

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,150
tell children and Catholic school to

35
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,770
teach them that they can be good and

36
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,640
helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and useful wherever they go</font>

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,110
bloom<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cracks in the sidewalk</font>

38
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,530
bloom in a tiny plastic cup but things

39
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,490
don't exactly balloon here bloom<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

40
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,230
you're planted that's easy to say when

41
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an actual literal rain</font>

42
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,020
forest but it's sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a phrase that</font>

43
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,990
kind of Rob's you of your agency right

44
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,150
this plant metaphors go I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

45
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">David bezane lyric all only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should curse</font>

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,800
their branches for not letting them

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,020
decide where they should fall I packed

48
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,330
up and rolled out here before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I even</font>

49
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,000
knew when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had signed up for I drove</font>

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,490
into town thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't tell me I'm</font>

51
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,169
seriously supposed to struggle down

52
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,380
roots here in a city dropped into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,630
desert where people survive every day

54
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,790
despite being about as meant to live

55
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,570
here as we are on Mars the plants here

56
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,790
aren't pretty they're few and far

57
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,360
between they're small and dusty and

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
toughened up from the Sun their

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,739
tenacious but don't bloom

60
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,390
here just because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they were</font>

61
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,260
planted but because this plan is not for

62
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,420
everyone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're the only ones who</font>

63
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,480
managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> survive and will I bloom here</font>

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,640
I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so in the comments I'd</font>

65
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,700
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what do you do when you're</font>

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,880
really really homesick if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>
