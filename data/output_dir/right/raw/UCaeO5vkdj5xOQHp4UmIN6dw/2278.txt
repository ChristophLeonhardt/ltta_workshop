00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,090
but it's worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

190
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,130
something he said about the email

these other emails and they do contain

250
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,100
some emails from Hillary Clinton<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

251
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,270
they don't know he hasn't said<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

252
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,280
about what's on them there's some

253
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,630
speculation that he wouldn't have gone

254
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to all this trouble if if he didn't</font>

255
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there was something really in</font>

256
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,750
there but I I don't know about that

257
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,430
because he

258
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,890
told<font color="#CCCCCC"> Congress he told Congress that this</font>

259
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,300
was over you know that he had done

260
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything he'd seen all the emails he'd</font>

261
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,390
gone through everything so he kind of

262
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,339
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no we're now</font>

263
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:08,350
reinvestigating he could not say that

264
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether whatever anybody thinks whether</font>

265
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,580
he's covering his bat but or whatever

266
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,380
you know he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had he basically had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

267
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> her get I don't know if it would be</font>

268
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,490
perjury but it would certainly be<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

269
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,020
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad for him alright and we'll</font>

270
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comee in a minute but first</font>

271
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">I love now remember remember Clavin</font>

272
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,709
second rule of mainstream media

273
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,959
journalism right when there is a scandal

274
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,750
when there is a scandal on the right the

275
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,360
news is the scandal when there was a

276
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,779
scandal on the left the news is who got

277
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,490
the information and how is it obtained

278
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,890
so when there's a scandal on the left

279
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,320
it's 0 the Russians the Russians you

280
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,390
know Oh James Comey James Comey<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

281
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,010
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

282
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">left if it's a scandal on the right side</font>

283
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,950
never mind all that let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get down to</font>

284
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,630
brass tacks let's get down to the

285
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,700
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in here so Hillary</font>

286
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,839
Clinton comes out with her statement

287
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,120
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is her reading her prepared</font>

288
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,700

289
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,890
liar you always were a way to me that

290
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,420
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually Hillary Clinton in</font>

291
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,920
whatever happened to Baby Jane I forgot

292
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,470
that whatever happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Baby I'll</font>

293
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,190
here's her statement we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 days out</font>

294
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,410
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps the most important national</font>

director himself has said he doesn't

300
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,240
know whether the emails referenced in

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,140
his letter are significant or not I'm

302
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,910
confident whatever they are will not

303
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,660
change the conclusion reached in July

304
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,700
therefore it's imperative that the

305
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">bureau explained this issue in question</font>

306
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,120
whatever it is without<font color="#CCCCCC"> any delay so I</font>

307
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,360
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward to moving forward to focus</font>

308
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,610
on the important challenges facing the

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,040
American people winning<font color="#E5E5E5"> on november</font>

310
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,320
eighth and working with all Americans to

311
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,360
build a better future for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font>

312
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,760
thank you so I not numerous

313
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,850
I don't know you call them lies that

314
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,620
woman cannot open her mouth<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with a</font>

315
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,730
prepared statement without saying

316
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,080
something that's inherently dishonest

317
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,300
calling them them through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a late release</font>

318
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,730
these emails is inherently dishonest

319
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,040
because they can't they can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they</font>

320
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at them they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get</font>

321
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,010
they've gotten the warrant now I think

322
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just happened but you know they</font>

323
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,120
when you go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and search for something</font>

324
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,100
and you find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not on the</font>

325
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,540
warrant you didn't have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a warrant</font>

326
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,190
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> search those so she knows these</font>

327
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,780
things can't be released right away plus

328
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,090
her State Department working on her

329
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,400
behalf as we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> from WikiLeaks working</font>

330
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,500
on her behalf and in concert with the

331
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">President of the United</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> States and</font>

332
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
concert with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the White House has been</font>

333
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,150
obstructing all this information all

334
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,850
this time so this sudden concern that

335
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,710
everything come out you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and be</font>

336
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,320
released is absolute nonsense plus she

337
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,450
repeatedly said she repeatedly said that

338
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,370
this letter was sent only to Republicans

339
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,290
which just wasn't true was sent to both

340
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,910
Republicans and Democrats I got to say

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,830
