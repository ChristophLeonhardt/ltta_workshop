1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,440
As part of the European Union, the United
Kingdom's borders have been relatively open

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,200
for years.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,040
Trade's carried out freely with other member
countries and people coming through only need

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,209
to show their EU passport.

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:21,690
But in June 2016, the UK voted to leave the
EU so that it could reassert control on its

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,460
own borders - and decide who and what it wanted
to let through.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,150
Imagine these boundaries turning into hard
borders.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,210
The impact of that on these maritime borders
is complicated in terms of trade,

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,250
but it could have serious implications for
the people living along the UK’s only

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,950
overland border — here.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,640
This border, between Northern Ireland and
the Republic of Ireland, is one of the reasons

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,829
why Brexit negotiations continue to reach
a deadlock.

13
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,890
That’s because this isn’t just a boundary
between two countries...

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,620
It’s also a compromise.

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,160
A symbol of identity.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,100
A solution to a troubled history.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,270
And it’s been keeping the peace in Northern
Ireland for 20 years.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,820
Hardening this border could put one of Europe’s
greatest success stories in jeopardy.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,320
This border was first drawn in 1920 by the

20
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,240
British, who had ruled over the island for
centuries.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,969
The Irish had rebelled several times, but

22
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:19,560
not everyone wanted the British to leave.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,640
So, eventually the UK divided the island into
two states based on its population.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,380
Most people in this part were historically
Catholic, and identified as Irish, and wanted

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,659
independence.

26
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,590
They were known as Nationalists.

27
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,490
But in the North, many people were 
Protestant, identified more closely as British

28
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,770
and wanted to stay in the UK.

29
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,299
They were called Unionists.

30
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,400
After the partition, this part remained in
the UK as Northern Ireland.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,780
We made that decision as a people quite freely, and for very definite reasons.

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,900
Reasons that are historical, reasons that are cultural, and reasons that are economic.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,240
The south continued to move away from
the UK until it gained complete independence

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,740
and became a new country -- the Republic of
Ireland.

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,380
At first, this 499 kilometer border was pretty
porous.

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,080
But the UK and Ireland continued to be hostile.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,120
Over time, customs checks were set up at the border
crossings and the two countries descended into

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,939
a trade war - tariffs were placed on agricultural
produce and goods like steel and coal.

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,880
By the late 1960s, things turned violent.

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,420
Violence like this hit Northern Ireland after years of simmering bitterness between the Catholic minority

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,860
and the ruling Protestant regime.

42
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,780
In Northern Ireland, fierce conflict broke
out between extremist groups.

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,860
Nationalist paramilitaries, like the Irish
Republican Army, believed that Northern Ireland

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,380
was rightfully part of Ireland and that the
British were oppressors of Northern Ireland's

45
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,480
Nationalist population.

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Unionist paramilitaries fought back; defending
their place in the UK.

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,530
Both groups blew up buildings, set off car
bombs, and engaged in bloody street fighting.

48
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,269
The UK deployed thousands of troops to Northern
Ireland during this time; and became a common

49
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:03,989
target of Nationalist paramilitary attacks.

50
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,220
Especially at the border, which for Nationalists
was the ultimate symbol of British occupation.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,940
"Welsh fuseliers who patrol this stretch of the border

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,180
described in court as the main battle line between the IRA and the army,

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,140
have suffered repeated attacks."

54
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,880
As violence surged, the UK military tried
to secure the border with walls, towers, heavy

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,519
guns, and patrols.

56
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,920
They tightly controlled the 20 official crossings

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,160
and screened people and vehicles passing through.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,549
The conflict over Northern Ireland turned
this into a hard border.

59
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,540
The violence lasted for more than 30 years,
killed over 3,600 people and came to be known

60
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,700
as The Troubles.

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,400
It came to end in 1998, when Nationalist
and Unionist Party leaders came together for

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,959
a historic peace deal.

63
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,239
They reached a compromise: Northern Ireland
would remain in the UK but people would be

64
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,290
eligible for both Irish and UK citizenships.

65
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,760
And in the future, Northern Ireland could
vote to join Ireland.

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,999
This deal came to be known as the Good Friday
Agreement.

67
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:06,269
It allowed Nationalists in Northern Ireland
to be part of the Republic of Ireland while

68
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,579
the Unionists remained part of the UK.

69
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,079
Which meant this hard border wasn’t needed
anymore.

70
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,319
So, the British military left.

71
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,760
The watchtowers came down.

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,829
And more roads opened.

73
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,639
There are now around 270 official crossings
- most of which are completely invisible.

74
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,780
And they're all part of a border that stands
as a symbol of the compromise that ended decades

75
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,680
of conflict.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,320
"The British people have voted to leave the European Union."

77
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,060
"Reignited a fierce debate over Northern Ireland's future."

78
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,700
"Because both are members of the European Union.

79
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,940
But when Britain pulls out of the EU,"

80
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,880
"it's now an outer-EU border and the question is,

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,280
do we put up barbed wire again? Soldiers? There'll be a custom borders at the very least."

82
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,780
In June 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU, even
though Northern Ireland was overwhelmingly

83
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,070
in favor of remaining.

84
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,300
The UK’s argument in favor of Brexit was
to control its own national borders — but

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,570
there was little mention of its Irish border
at the time.

86
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,790
That changed when the UK and EU started negotiations
-- the status of the Irish border became one

87
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,640
of the first three things to figure out.

88
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,800
Now, more than a year later, it’s still
unresolved.

89
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,100
But there are a few options:
The UK could reimpose a hard border by bringing

90
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,480
back the police and the walls.

91
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,170
But that would isolate the population of Nationalists
in Northern Ireland.

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,880
Alternatively, they could put the border here,
leaving Northern Ireland in the EU Customs Union,

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,460
but separating it from the UK mainland.

94
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,000
But this would betray the Unionists.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,290
See, either way, both these options risk
violating the Good Friday Agreement.

96
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,160
A third option is for the UK to stay in the
EU Customs Union meaning it wouldn't need a

97
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,310
customs border, but that’s unacceptable
for Brexiters in the UK government, who specifically

98
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,140
want control over their own borders.

99
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,500
The UK needs to put a border somewhere but
just can't decide where.

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,460
“On relation to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,

101
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,880
we will not return to a hard border between Northern Ireland

102
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,520
and Ireland”.

103
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,440
“But the suggestion that there should be a border down the Irish Sea,

104
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the

105
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,110
United Kingdom is completely unacceptable."

106
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,750
"We are not going to
be in a customs union, we’re not going to

107
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,020
be in the Customs Union, because if we were, that would prevent us

108
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,020
from being able to follow an independent trade policy.”

109
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,620
Now, there's a fourth option that would be in
line with the Good Friday Agreement  — it’s

110
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,690
the idea of reunification.

111
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,341
In the past when both Ireland and the UK were
in the EU and the borders were open; there

112
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:33,160
was little incentive for Northern Ireland
to vote to reunite with the Republic of Ireland.

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,800
But if the UK went with the option of hard
borders, Northern Ireland would be isolated

114
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,640
and the only way to rejoin the EU would be
through reunification.

115
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,330
Typically, this would be an overwhelming victory
for the Nationalists and a loss for the Unionists.

116
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,470
But Brexit seems to have changed some opinions.

117
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,460
A recent poll found that 28% of the respondents
who supported Northern Ireland’s place in

118
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,910
the UK would now vote to join the Republic
of Ireland.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,840
While not a perfect solution, it would give
Northern Ireland a voice about its own place

120
00:07:02,840 --> 00:00:00,000
in Europe; a voice that’s barely been heard
so far.
