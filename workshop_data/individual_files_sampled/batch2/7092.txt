young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcasts of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio the internet regulations as we know them are all about to change so the republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted along party lines in December to repeal the rules which were intended to prevent internet providers from blocking speeding up or slowing down access to specific online services now in a statement at the time to the FCC chairman a jeep I framed of the upcoming repeal as removing some burdensome regulations here's what he said at the time now on June 11th these unnecessary and harmful internet regulations will be repealed and the bipartisan light-touch approach that served the online world well for nearly twenty years will be restored now there are obviously two very different sides to this and here's what you need to know the concern among net neutrality advocates is that the repeal could give internet providers too much control over how online content is delivered it may also make it harder for the next generation of online services to compete if they have to pay up to be placed in a so-called Internet fast lane jessica rosin wersal is a democrat who is on the commission who voted against the repeal and this is what she said in part in her statement plain and simple thanks to the FCC's rollback of net neutrality internet providers have the legal greenlight the technical ability and business incentive to discriminate and manipulate what we see read and learn on live now for his part a G PI has said that there are still some sufficient safeguards in place to protect against broadband abusing their control over the Internet broadband service providers so that said okay so LG Pie says that there also are there are still some protections in place he didn't list any of them but there are still some protections in place he is full of complete BS that's that's all he's full of he is a trump appointee but more he's a former lawyer for Verizon which is an internet service provider which has lobbied very aggressively to do away with these regulatory standards that would prevent them from slowing down the speeds of their competitors and other websites they disagree with there are no protections put in place and if there are its tiny tiny in comparison to what net neutrality actually did accomplish and if those protections were never something that people wanted to infringe upon then what was the problem with the regulations I also think I don't want to get your take on this mark so he says the the online world this was the light touch approach that served the online world well for nearly 20 years will be restored I wonder do you think the Internet has perhaps changed since when that was in place no not at all it's been the same for 20 years right just populated it's just gotten more more crowded and now they throw a couple of important things first last thing first maybe the economic incentive which is was mentioned grace mentioned economic incentive that is there in a big way so that they will almost I think by definition because that economic incentive charge people web sites streaming services all the rest to have a space on that broadband in other words that's what's going to happen if you want to watch you know Mark Thompson calm whatever I'm gonna have to pay more for you to be able to watch Mark Thompson calm and at any kind of reasonable streaming rate so there is an economic incentive for them to begin charging and having a fast lane in a slow lane and where what have you seen in America whenever there's an economic incentive it's not just even America internationally when there's an economic incentive it's gonna happen so you're gonna start seeing charges by the way just on the politics this was something that even under Obama was threatened you'll remember Tom wheeler the FCC Chairman who also had roots as a big executive in the cable industry he was running the FCC I mean you see how swampy Washington is always now it's swampy er than was it's so ironic that Trump you know had that drained the Strom swamp crap but anyway these guys all come from this world and they now have a huge victory there's gonna be a lot of money at stake and they're gonna there's gonna be money that's pouring into these providers and there are multiple factors that make this particular story so disastrous it's not just the fact that we're now doing away by the way the reason why this is a big story today is because the regulations are now gone effective today June 11 so that's the reason why people are talking about it but when you couple the lack of regulations with all of these major Internet service providers merging together and the fact that a lot of these providers have created monopolies throughout the country so for instance if you are living in certain parts of the country you can only get Time Warner other parts of the country you can only get Verizon a lot of these Internet service providers telecommunications companies have now purchased major media organizations and companies and so not only will it create a financial incentive for you know these telecommunications companies to act like mob bosses demanding money for the fast lane but they'll slow down the speeds for their competitors why wouldn't they so the free and open Internet will cease to exist and it's it's really a disastrous thing if you believe in a free and open Internet to inform yourself in order to seek the truth we're now going to have these gatekeepers of information deciding what we do and what we can and can't see and that's what that's that's what scares me the most and it's also gonna be increasingly difficult if not impossible for independent media to thrive right yes exactly and and that is the where the shoe really pinches because the open dialogue that you get on the Internet everything coming to you at the same speed all the different opinions all the different sources of information coming in in the same way at the same speed that is going to be gone and then you cut to places like Sinclair broadcasting and as Anna says the consolidation and monopolization of our democratic process that is to say the plurality of thought the plurality of all of those different forms of information all of that being now consolidated and monopolized by a few companies and you end up with a huge company like Sinclair which we know is right-wing not letting you see even anything that's progressive or left this is a real dark day for information and for a yet another way that they're bleeding out the democracy to easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button
