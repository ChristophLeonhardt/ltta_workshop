1
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:03,574
EAR.

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:05,042
STEVE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

3
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:06,610
JILLIAN, WITH 13 DAYS FOR THE

4
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:08,546
MIDTERMS, IT'S A TIGHT RACE FOR

5
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:10,414
THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR RACE, NEW

6
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:13,851
POLL FROM QUINNIPIAC PROGRESS

7
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:15,953
SIEVE MAYOR ANDREW GILLEM AHEAD

8
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:17,421
OF RON DESANTIS.

9
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:18,823
AT THIS POINT SIX POINTS.

10
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:20,925
AINSLEY: JOINING US ON A BUSY

11
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:22,793
CAMPAIGN MORNING, RON DESANTIS.

12
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:23,661
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

13
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:24,362
>> GOOD MORN.

14
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:25,363
AINSLEY: WHAT DO YOU SAY WITH

15
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:26,697
THOSE VOTERS BECAUSE YOU'RE DOWN

16
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:27,932
A LITTLE BIT IN THE POLLS?

17
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,800
>> WELL LOOK, WE HAVE AN

18
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,602
OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT FLORIDA'S

19
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:32,603
ECONOMIC MOMENTUM.

20
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:34,138
I WILL DO THAT AND REALLY TAKE

21
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:36,574
IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

22
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:38,442
ANDREW IS RUNNING ON MASSIVE TAX

23
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:40,144
INCREASES WHICH WOULD COST JOBS.

24
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:41,846
CAUSE BUSINESSES TO LEAVE

25
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:42,179
FLORIDA.

26
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,581
IT WOULD STOP THE FLOW OF

27
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:44,815
INVESTMENT COMING INTO FLORIDA

28
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:45,483
WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT.

29
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:47,852
HE IS ALSO SOMEBODY WHO PRESIDES

30
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:49,587
OVER THE MOST CRIME-RIDDEN CITY

31
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:51,021
IN FLORIDA, TALLAHASSEE.

32
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:52,523
THEY HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF

33
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:53,524
MURDERS LAST YEAR.

34
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:55,793
HE SIGNED AN ANTI-POLICE

35
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:56,160
MANIFESTO.

36
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,028
HE WANTS TO ABOLISH I.C.E.

37
00:00:58,029 --> 00:00:59,096
HE WON'T COOPERATE WITH THE

38
00:00:59,097 --> 00:00:59,797
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

39
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:01,932
SO FLORIDA WOULD HAVE MORE CRIME

40
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,033
UNDER ANDREW GILLEM.

41
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,202
THAT WOULD BE DISASTEROUS FOR

42
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:06,437
OUR STATE THAT UNDERCUTS

43
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:07,605
EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO DO

44
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:08,172
ECONOMICALLY WITH THE

45
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:10,574
ENVIRONMENT, YOU NAME IT.

46
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:12,443
STEVE: A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS

47
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:13,310
MAKING FLORIDA THEIR HOME.

48
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,712
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS CARAVAN

49
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:17,114
IN MEXICO THAT IS HEADED OUR

50
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:17,381
WAY?

51
00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:20,251
WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM

52
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:21,952
MR. GILLUM REGARDING THIS, I

53
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:22,787
DON'T BELIEVE.

54
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:25,356
>> OBVIOUSLY A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY

55
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:27,792
CAN'T JUST HAVE PEOPLE PLOWING

56
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:28,626
ACROSS ITS BORDER.

57
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:30,194
I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT

58
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:31,896
TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

59
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:34,298
I DON'T THINK WE CAN COUNTENANCE

60
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:34,765
THAT.

61
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,333
ANDREW HAS OPEN BORDER POLICIES.

62
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,668
HE BASICALLY SAID THAT IS WHAT

63
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:39,904
HE WANTS, HE WANTS FLORIDA TO BE

64
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:42,573
A SANCTUARY STATE AND HAVE

65
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:43,073
SANCTUARY CITIES.

66
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:44,575
WHEN YOU DO THAT, OBVIOUSLY

67
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,912
FOLKS COME IN, WE DON'T NO HOE

68
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:49,480
THEY ARE, BUT IT'S A WET KISS

69
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,115
FROM THE DRUG CARTELS THEY MOVE

70
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,983
THE PRODUCT IN FROM CHINA,

71
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,552
FENTANYL DRIVING OPIOID CRISIS.

72
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:56,120
THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR ANYWHERE IN

73
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,189
THE COUNTRY.

74
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,224
OBVIOUSLY THAT STUFF FINDS ITS

75
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:02,793
WAY TO FLORIDA.

76
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:05,029
BRIAN: ANDREW GILLUM WAS FROM

77
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,429
TALLAHASSEE.

78
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,131
HIS INTELLECT IS STRONG AFTER

79
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:08,165
THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE.

80
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,733
ONE THING IS CLEAR HE IS UNDER

81
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:10,267
FBI INVESTIGATION.

82
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,869
WE HAVE SOME DETAILS NOW.

83
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,004
TURNS OUT AN FBI UNDER COVER

84
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,840
AGENT TRIED TO OFFER HIM

85
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:16,574
"HAMILTON" TICKETS.

86
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:17,808
HE TOOK IT.

87
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,276
HE DID HAVE A EXPLANATION THAT

88
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:21,145
HIS BROTHER GAVE IT TO HIM BUT

89
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:23,547
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE PLAYING

90
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:23,814
OUT.

91
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:24,415
>> NO.

92
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,817
IN FACT HE, I ASKED HIM

93
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:28,219
DIRECTLY, WE HAD A DEBATE SUNDAY

94
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,321
AND HE SAID HE PAYS FOR

95
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:30,821
EVERYTHING.

96
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,056
HAS NEVER TAKEN ANYTHING.

97
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,357
WELL THEN THE DOCUMENTS THAT

98
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,458
CAME OUT SHOWED JUST THE

99
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:34,825
OPPOSITE.

100
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:37,628
THAT YES, THIS UNDERCOVER FBI

101
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,063
AGENT POSING AS A CONTRACTOR

102
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:40,297
TRYING TO DO BUSINESS WITH HIM

103
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:42,032
AS MAYOR WITH THE CITY OF

104
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,201
TALLAHASSEE, HE IS THE ONE THAT

105
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:47,137
GAVE ANDREW THE "HAMILTON"

106
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:47,705
TICKETS.

107
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,006
ANDREW LIED TO THE FOLKS OF

108
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:49,540
FLORIDA.

109
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,108
BUT ALSO THE FACT HE IS GETTING,

110
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:52,676
HE CLAIMS HE IS NOT UNDER

111
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:53,110
INVESTIGATION.

112
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:55,079
WHY THE HECK WOULD LAW

113
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,580
ENFORCEMENT SEND AN UNDERCOVER

114
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,949
AGENT TO LINE HIS POCKETS IF HE

115
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,950
WASN'T UNDER INVESTIGATION?

116
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,951
OF COURSE HE IS.

117
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:02,953
HE HAS VIOLATED FLORIDA LAW BY

118
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,355
ACCEPTING THOSE GIFTS, NOT JUST

119
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:06,757
THAT, BUT THIS LUXURY VACATION

120
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:07,458
TO COSTA RICA.

121
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,260
THE DOCUMENTS ALSO SHOW HE

122
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,628
DIDN'T PAY FOR THAT.

123
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,429
LO AND BEHOLD THE LOBBIEST THAT

124
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,164
TOOK HIM ON THAT TRIP TO COAST

125
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:15,866
CAN REEK CAN, HE TURNED AROUND

126
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:18,035
AND GAVE THE LOBBIEST $2 MILLION

127
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:20,137
IN CITY MONEY TO BUILD A

128
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:20,538
RESTAURANT.

129
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,873
THAT IS LOCAL CORRUPTION LOOKS

130
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:23,173
LIKE.

131
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:24,108
BRIAN: CONGRESSMAN, HERE IS THE

132
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,409
MOMENT FROM SUNDAY'S DEBATE.

133
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,378
>> THE QUESTION IS, DID YOU PAY

134
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,780
FOR THE "HAMILTON" TICKET OR DID

135
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:32,349
THE UNCOVER FBI PAY FOR THE

136
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,484
"HAMILTON" TICKET?

137
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:35,619
DID YOU PAY TO STAY IN THE VILLA

138
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,921
IN COSTA RICA?

139
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:37,955
WHERE ARE THE RECEIPTS?

140
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,356
YOU HAVE NOT PROVEN YOU PAID FOR

141
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:39,723
ANYTHING.

142
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:40,291
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

143
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,458
>> HERE IS DIRECT ANSWER.

144
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,327
I DON'T TAKE FREE TRIPS IN

145
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:43,661
ANYBODY.

146
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,029
I'M A HARD-WORKING PERSON.

147
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,397
I KNOW THAT MAY NOT FIT YOUR

148
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:47,731
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU THINK

149
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,700
PEOPLE LIKE ME DO BUT I WORKED

150
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,268
HARD FOR EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE

151
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,269
GOTTEN AND IN MY LIFE.

152
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,837
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY HANDING ME

153
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,707
ANYTHING FOR FREE.

154
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,109
STEVE: CONGRESSMAN?

155
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,678
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE DOCUMENTS

156
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,513
THAT WERE RELEASED COME DOWN ON

157
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:03,948
THAT STATEMENT LIKE A TON OF

158
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,281
BRICKS.

159
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,816
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, HE

160
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:08,052
WAS GETTING THINGS FOR FREE AND

161
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:09,920
NOT JUST THAT.

162
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,488
LOOK, IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE GOT

163
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:12,723
SOMETHING FOR FREE.

164
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,058
I DON'T LIKE GETTING THINGS FOR

165
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,459
FREE AS A PERSON BUT WHEN YOU

166
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,194
TALK ABOUT THIS WAS CONNECTED TO

167
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:19,029
HIS ROLE AS MAYOR.

168
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,129
THESE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING TO

169
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,464
INFLUENCE HIM, WHO HAD BUSINESS

170
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:21,865
BEFORE HIM.

171
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,001
SO HE IS PUTTING MONEY IN HIS

172
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,103
POCKET EFFECTIVELY, THEN TURNING

173
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:27,538
AROUND DOING THE BIDDING OF THE

174
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,239
SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING HIM

175
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,707
THIS STUFF.

176
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,240
THAT IS WRONG.

177
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:32,509
AINSLEY: IF HE IS, IF HE IS

178
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,811
TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAYS

179
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,779
HIS BROTHER GAVE HIM THE

180
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,647
"HAMILTON" TICKETS.

181
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,581
STEVE: HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE

182
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:37,915
BROTHER.

183
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,816
AINSLEY: IS THAT ALLOWED?

184
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,217
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GET FREE

185
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:42,219
THINGS FROM THE FAMILY, JUST NOT

186
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,420
FROM SOMEONE ELSE?

187
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,188
>> EXACTLY.

188
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:49,460
IF THE UNCOVER GAVE THE TICKETS

189
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,728
TO HIS BROTHER TO GIVE TO

190
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,296
ANDREW, THAT WOULD BE NO

191
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:52,696
DIFFERENCE.

192
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:53,297
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

193
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,699
THAT IS WHY HE SO EVASIVE.

194
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,868
HE LASHED OUT IN THE DEBATE

195
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:59,103
BECAUSE HE KNEW HE WAS NOT ON

196
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:00,971
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FACTS

197
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:01,271
HERE.

198
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,741
WHAT WE HAVE TO KEEP HOLDING HIM

199
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:04,408
TO THE FIRE.

200
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,377
THE MEDIA HAS NOT DONE VERY MUCH

201
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:07,911
ON THIS FINALLY THIS CAME OUT

202
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:08,912
BECAUSE OF A SUBPOENA REQUEST IN

203
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:13,350
THE ETHICS INVESTIGATION INTO

204
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:14,051
ANDREW.

205
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,052
STEVE: TAMPA BAY NEWSPAPER IS

00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,620
DOING THAT A LOT OF LOCAL

207
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:17,621
OUTLETS IN FLORIDA TODAY.

208
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:19,323
NOT EXACTLY WHEN YOU WANT IT TO

209
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:20,891
DROP TWO WEEKS OUT BEFORE THE

210
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,860
ELECTION.

211
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:23,727
MR. DESANTIS THE PRESIDENT

212
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:24,728
TWEETED SUPPORT FOR YOU.

213
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,964
HE ADDED MORE STOPS BEFORE THE

214
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:27,331
MIDTERMS.

215
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:29,400
IS HEADING BACK TO THE SUNSHINE

216
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:29,700
STATE?

217
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:30,868
>> I THINK SO.

218
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:32,803
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE

219
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:34,672
WHITE HOUSE WILL ANNOUNCE AND

220
00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:35,839
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WILL ANNOUNCE

221
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,940
WHEN THEY WANT TO.

222
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,108
BUT I THINK YOU WILL SEE HIM

223
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,943
HERE THE YOU SAW THAT TEXAS

224
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:40,244
CROWD.

225
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:42,613
I THINK YOU WILL SEE SIMILAR

226
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,380
ENTHUSIASM FOR HERE IN THE STATE

227
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:43,781
OF FLORIDA.

228
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:45,649
BRIAN: CONGRESSMAN SOME SAY

229
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,452
YOU'RE GOOD AT DEFINING WHAT

230
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:51,321
GILLUM WILL DO, RAISE TAX, THAT

231
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:52,656
NATURE, YOU'RE NOT SAYING GOOD

232
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,992
ENOUGH JOB WHAT YOU WOULD DO.

233
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:55,993
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

234
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:56,994
YOU AND GOVERNOR SCOTT?

235
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,262
>> WE'RE COMING IN AT A

236
00:05:58,263 --> 00:05:58,862
DIFFERENT TIME.

237
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,597
RICK CAME IN WITH ECONOMY IN THE

238
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:00,898
TANK.

239
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,533
I'M COMING IN WITH THE ECONOMY

240
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:02,833
GOING.

241
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,702
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS

242
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:06,103
CAPITALIZE OFF THAT, RECRUIT

243
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:07,371
RECORD INVESTMENT INTO FLORIDA

244
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:10,074
SO WE EXPAND OUR ECONOMIC BASE,

245
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:10,941
FINANCE TECHNOLOGY,

246
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:12,342
MANUFACTURING, THAT IS MORE

247
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:13,811
HIGH-PAYING JOBS.

248
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,612
ALSO WE HAD PERSISTENT PROBLEMS

249
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:17,081
WITH OUR WATER RESOURCES.

250
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,649
WE HAVE TO CLEAN THE WATER, MAKE

251
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,085
SURE WE RESTORE THE EVERGLADES

252
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:22,453
AND STOP TOXIC ALGAE.

253
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:24,722
I'M IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO DO

254
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:25,022
THAT.

255
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,290
I STOOD UP AGAINST SOME OF THE

256
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,991
BIGGEST INTERESTS IN FLORIDA TO

257
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:28,959
DO THE RIGHT THING.

258
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,561
I'M ONLY ONE OF THE TWO OF US

259
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:32,262
WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT DONE.

260
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,264
THAT IS AN ISSUE ON THE

261
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:37,101
FOREFRONT OF A LOT OF FLORIDIANS

262
00:06:37,102 --> 00:00:00,000
MINDS.
