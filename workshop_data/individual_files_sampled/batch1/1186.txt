hi I'm Olivia and you're in the stream now live on al-jazeera and YouTube and I manage evidene today we're diving into three stories that really have our community talking we begin in Washington DC where the fallout continues following u.s. president Donald Trump's historic meeting in Helsinki this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin there is even more confusion about what President Trump believes or does not believe about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election on Monday and how sinky Trump would not say if he believed US intelligence officials assessment that Russia meddled in his country's election an election he won his missteps sparked admonition from both Democrats and Republicans and put the White House on the defensive so on Tuesday he attempted to correct the error I realized that there is need for some clarification it should have been obvious I thought it would be obvious but I would like to clarify just in case it wasn't in a key sentence in my remarks I said the word would instead of wouldn't the sentence should have been I don't see any reason why I wouldn't well why it wouldn't be Russian the latest twists have seen president Trump at odds with his aides and at one point with himself joining us to discuss the fallout and how the White House and the president are handling it is Al Jazeera's very own White House correspondent I'm Kimberly how cat welcome to the stream Kimberly I want to start with a tweet where else president Trump's Twitter feed this was tweeted July 18th just this Wednesday so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference Putin and I discussed many important subjects in our earlier meeting we got along very well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match big results will come Kimberly has the president in your mind and based on your reporting and poll numbers that you've seen has he convinced voters here that he takes allegations of Russian interference serious I think there's been widespread concern by both Democrats and Republicans about the president's sort of wavering back and forth with his reluctance to accept the intelligence a very prominent well-respected not just members of the US government but also members of his own administration and that's been concerning to members on Capitol Hill in fact so much so we've seen just even here in Washington on Thursday a vote in the Senate and what's so interesting about this vote Malika is that it was unanimous at what they were voting on is something that was discussed behind closed doors between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Helsinki and been very concerning to members of Congress and this is the idea that there could be this exchange back and forth between the United States and Russia where Russia could essentially question two u.s. citizens a former US ambassador and also a US businessman in fact one thing they haven't convicted an abstention of corruption and in exchange the United States would get to question 12 Russian intelligence officials with regard to them being indicted by the Special Counsel Robert Muller well this has just outraged members of Congress particularly Democrats who say subjecting diplomats to what they've called Putin's thuggery is an abuse of power so they voted in the Senate 98 to zero and to make sure that never happens what we're seeing is this push back by the against the president by the legislative branch and in a divided America this is really stunning Kimberly to your point you know divided America there are so many divisions between the different branches of governments and also between the people and a lot of people asking the questions about loyalty who is Donald Trump loyal to HG Flores for example saying at the Helsinki summit Trump revealed his loyalties to himself above all else in aligning himself with Putin over his own intelligence community Trump demonstrated his willingness to throw America under the bus in pursuit of self-preservation now Kimberly self-preservation is hardly an unusual pursuit for politicians but in this case is this really the watershed moment it's been made out to be Trump said that it's a shame there's even a little bit of a cloud over his election you know kind of tying his election to the Russian investigation is this is this a pivotal moment certainly there are many in the United States that believe it is often we can't tell without a little bit more distance what I can tell you is significant Donald Trump reverting to a standard playbook and that is to blame the fake news media for the negative coverage that you know whether you're liberal or conservative in the United States most people have panned as being an example of where the president best was utterly unprepared for that very very pivotal meeting when you take into context the historical significance of a u.s. president and a Russian president standing side by side given the history of the two countries being adversaries and there was no question that the president should have been prepared for the conversation and showed that he wasn't so in terms of self-preservation Donald Trump we we know from his presidency has this need to be accepted well-liked when things go wrong instead of looking inward and reflecting and improving upon listening to his communications team taking the advice of his Director of National Intelligence saying there still is Russian interference something that was underscored again on Thursday by his Department of Homeland Security Secretary he instead lashes out this has been his default setting he's continuing to do this blaming the media blaming those of that lacked the higher intelligence he believes in order to understand the complexities in the nuances but we all sought for ourselves the president messed up and now he's in damage control mode the White House has been doing so for four days so Kimberly the question on I think a lot of people's minds and the international community is is it working or will it have an effect on his base well we have poll numbers that tell us exactly that and so far no I think what's interesting to note is that the president is essentially blaming the media for what happened in the the perception that this did not go over well and Republican supporters overwhelmingly agree with the president I think the reason that some of this exists and we have to look at some of the Gallup poll numbers going into the Helsinki press conference and summit it Russia doesn't register on the radar of the ordinary American voter the same way issues like the economy the same way immigration does and governance at the end of the day we have to look at why Donald Trump was elected it's because there's dissatisfaction with the system there's no transparency accountability and Capitol Hill is to blame for much of that but we've not yet addressed that underlying issue and so this continues and perpetuates Kimberly when you talk about this continuing and perpetuating looking at the International perspective on all this what about the future I mean Casey on Twitter saying what does the rest of the world think of the fact that POTUS is a pathological liar who counted to a Russian dictator and is now considering sending a US diplomat to Russia for interrogation what does this do when President Trump cast so much doubt on on this specific case whether Russian interfered in the US elections when there are future elections around the world at stake whether in Chechnya whether elsewhere around the world certainly the the u.s. relationship with its allies is changing in large part because of the relationships with Donald Trump we've seen him many of his policies being very insular he was elected on an America first platform he certainly is doing that on a myriad of issues immigration trade this is no exception but certainly it leaves allies nervous looking for other pathways because there is no longer this belief internationally that the u.s. can be trusted and counted on when it comes to lying politicians well let's be honest Donald Trump is probably not the first politician that hasn't told the truth when it comes to US presidents and we've got a lot of examples of that but certainly it is egregious and I think if anything and I've certainly said this a number of times what Donald Trump is done is he has awakened a rather reluctant electorate one that's been a little bit lazy too if for lack of a better word so the fact that there is engagement now maybe the best thing so far to come out of this presidency looking towards the November elections in Congress that's where there is the real opportunity to be for there to be change and for voters to be engaged and yet so much more news before we get to that November date we all have just office she'll be covering it all we will have to fund the conversation there Thank You Kimberly but to see more of what she's covering at the White House including a look at what it's like in the West Wing follow her on Instagram her handle is at Kimberly hawk at you see turning to Haiti where Al Jazeera correspondent Gabriel Elizondo has been using his Instagram account to show some of his reporting on the recent protests there Hades Prime Minister has resigned following days of violent demonstrations sparked by the government's decision to raise fuel prices the protest started on Friday July 6th after officials announced an increase in prices of up to 50% and joining us to talk about this from port-au-prince economists kesner Pharrell and in New York Gabriel Elizondo who just returned from covering the unrest in Haiti welcome everyone Gabe I want to start with you sadly Bono on Twitter is summing this up in a sense saying I was there in Haiti for five days and there was no electricity in my part of town those five days and I was in port-au-prince after the earthquake in 2010 they didn't give electricity for weeks so the Haitian people need a break from the corruption that has plagued our country and you know we've heard from many different people raising these kinds of issues more long-term concerns but then fedley went to this saying that 30% hike on gas is a death blow in Haiti it would would be like you know if gas prices in the u.s. went to $5 a gallon could you contextualise this for us why did this happen yeah listen I mean it's it's this gas hike is is more than just a simple hike on Castle because it affected all of Haitian society it was a hike on gasoline a hike on diesel fuel and also and this is key 50 percent hike on kerosene now you say why is kerosene important because millions of Haitians rely on kerosene to power their homes because of a lack of electricity so you say okay kerosene let's just say it's $2 per per litre I'm just picking that number there it's somewhere around there let's say it goes up by 50 cents oh really is it is that really enough to take the streets and riot well you know what if you're one of the more than six million Haitians that lives on less than $2 a day a simple 50 cent increase in kerosene that powers your home is a big deal and that's why we saw this just spiral like the way it did and that gasoline of course affects primarily the business community that have trucks that they use digital products around the diesel fuel so if affected the middle-class that affected the business community and it also the poor with the kerosene hmm if this would have gone through these mm-hmm a customer you here Gabriel there explain how a gas price hike could lead to the fall of a prime minister I pulled up this headline here from aljazeera.com Haiti Prime Minister Jack Gilliland thought he resigns after days of protests I'm wondering in your perspective what you think the mood is like now because of course we saw these protests violent at times what's the atmosphere what is there still tension on the streets I could say that the mood is much better one week after I said what the porter starting July 6 but I can tell you also there was a by that time management because the prime minister had to design one week after and under pressure from the Parliament and also from the private sector and gabrielle is right he put it one in context the kerosene is pretty much you know what the popular the two people they use Haiti and why is that because only 30% of the population got electricity and this 30% is concentrated in the western part meant not to say the big metropolitan area of the capital so by hiking the kerosene much more than the gasoline I mean that's a big fuel that you put on your fire so he so I record that I can say the mood is much better but we're still having some I could say the consensus government the president is trying to get in touch with other people to see how they're going to get next government it's interesting you know the more we we learn about what's actually happening on the ground this is often being framed as well in a historic kind of context we have a this tweet from fedley actually again saying that the international audience should really realize that the Haitian people have been taken advantage of for years the government elected takes advantage of them the international community takes advantage of them the French took advantage of them you know with this latest incident this decision even who is really staged to gain and and who is being taken advantage of if anyone Gabriel well that's a big question you have about an hour and a half I wish you knew there were the real hold another series of tweets asking Emmanuel macron for example to actually step in and you know kind of live up to his part of the bargain right right I mean listen that's a that's a Kistner can probably answer that better than I can but I would say that this is just to give a little context on this gas price hike or proposed one guess who proposed the International Monetary Fund because Haiti entered into a deal with the IMF in February of this year the deal was this the IMF said we're gonna help you get ninety six million dollars in much needed funds the money was going to come from the World Bank the IAE be and that you in exchange though the IMF told Haiti we want you to do several things one of which is raise the price of gasoline because the gasoline prices according to IMF were too low and Haiti was losing income because they were subsidizing gasoline so this all stems from the imf's really pushing Haiti quite frankly to adopt this plan the Haitian government knew it was going to be wildly unpopular and so do you know why or I'm sorry when the Haitian government decided to announce this you'll never guess in the middle of a Brazil World Cup game why then because the vast majority of Haitians love Brazil they love Brazilian football and they were all watching the World Cup game so the government thought that they were gonna announce this maybe people won't notice it turns out that wasn't the case it went all over social media as soon as the game was over Brazil lost people took to the streets very upset and there you go the rest is history mm-hmm and we're seeing we're seeing scenes from that day on our screens right now Custer taking this back to the World Bank the IMF and of course having people on line point the fingers they're saying yes there's corruption or a country but where does the actual guilt lie I'm wondering what your take on that is is this a deal that the Haitian government should have entered into in the first place I think that the situation the political crisis is much more complicated it's the only the price increase we got to see also some bad governance and you could cease what you can call a political economy leadership malpractice why because the government wasn't having the contract with the IMF for the last three years and they have been making deficits and we're talking about a country where 60% of the property looks like we might have just lost Kestner he's coming to us from port-au-prince and that does often happen but Gabriel he was talking about a point that you know our community is pointing the fingers at the IMF in the World Bank yeah they really are I mean listen the Haiti has a long relationship with international donors so that's no surprise there but what what Kestner was saying when he what got cut off or what I think he was saying was this is more than just the gas price hike or proposed gas price hike this is more than simply the IMF it's easy in one way just to point the finger at the IMF the World Bank but you talk to almost all Haitians it looks like we got Kissinger back that's great right you point to all Haitians and they usually mention one thing and correct me if I'm wrong kesner corruption I never meant corruption because and because you bring up corruption I'm wondering the tie taught if we tie politicians to these concerns are Haiti right now we have a tweet saying is sadly owned by the IMF donations meant to aid charities went to salaries and administration but then we have for waz Ally asking will the resignation of the prime minister bring a reduction of fuel prices your thoughts kesner I think they're going to freeze it for like the next week or six months it's not going to solve the problems because I can tell you the subsidy that they get on the fuel is pretty much a 160 million dollars for lost revenue and they're losing 150 million dollars also in like tax exemption from the private sector to the free zones like the assembly sector and they're losing 100 million 150 million dollars also from the electricity subsidies we're talking about three hundred million dollars from a country with a budget only 2.5 billion dollars so there isn't mismanagement in finance that's what I was saying I am math you know it's easy for some expert to stay in DC and said increase your price but also in Haiti we have to put some fiscal orders right and kesner obviously that conversation is not going to end here but we're thankful that you both joined us Kesner for Farrell and Gabriel Elizondo and if you're not following him already that is Gabriel you can follow him of course on instagram has handles Gabriel um Elizondo we end in Iraq where a wave of protests across the south of the country have now expanded al Jazeera correspondent Imran Khan is on the ground covering the story the demonstrations which began in Basra entered a second week in despite the government's attempt to contain the unrest at least eight people had been killed in clashes with security forces joining us from Baghdad to discuss the growing protests is Al Jazeera correspondent Imran Khan welcome back to the stream Imran I'm starting with a piece that you wrote for the Al Jazeera website Iraq struggles with economic energy crisis as protests spread this is a July 18th how long has this tension been building and Basara well it's actually been building the last 15 years Basra has been severely underdeveloped when it comes to electricity infrastructure but what sparked these protests were the facts of their to the iranian government who supplies electricity to himself cut off supplies because the iraqi government owes it some 1.5 billion dollars in unpaid bills now the protesters came out on the street when the electricity got cut off they didn't blame the Iranians worse they blamed when the Iraqi government for it saying that this was another example of incompetence and corruption that those bills were paid and therefore they are naps suffering the anger you can see up on the screen there just spilled over and it's been a very long time in the making now what we also saw was the protesters really asking for two key things they want the energy back electricity clearly incredibly important but they also wanted economic fosters the oil hub of Iraq it's the oil-producing region but they blame the foreign oil companies or employing foreign workers and not local Iraqis and they say that's having an impact on them as well so like I said it's been a very long time in the making however it was only sparked in the last two weeks and the government's very worried about all of this they're very worried right that the potent thing will spread to places like Baghdad if it spreads and becomes a widespread movement that could dim Iran we have a lot of people commenting on Twitter JA and I leave for example about the corruption and some of what you brought up drought saying widespread corruption fraud and embezzlement in both public and private sectors along side with misallocation and mis I propose she appropriation forgive me of public funds are the two main reasons behind the lack of development and work opportunities in Iraq Ali says only people that are connected to political parties can get jobs and this violates the equality of opportunity you touched on some of that but you know how big a problem is nepotism and in some of these allegations of corruption you only have to ask any Iraqi here what it's like to try and get anything done even a basic thing like getting your passport done and they will talk to you about the fact that they need woster they need influence with somebody to help them get it done it's almost a way of life how many Iraqis are used to it but they're getting more and more angry the fact that you have to be connected now to a political party to get anything done to get a job government to pivotal in the army so ordinary Iraqis are very frustrated about this and they are taking to social media to complain about this however the government has shut down most of the social media in the country since these protests started so the fact that you're able to see those tweets is quite extraordinary given that you can't get on to Twitter here you can't get on to Facebook and that shows you just how worried the government it is about these protests about the social media element of these protests as well so they're shutting down social media I'm wondering is that the answer to the question I was about to ask you with what big up what is the government doing about this what is their official response and then the not so official response well the official response is to try and get a short a solution to the energy crisis in the cell like I said the Iranians are the ones that were supplying it there's unpaid bills and five million dollars so the Iranians aren't supplying that electricity anymore so what the Iraqi government did was send a high-level energy delegation to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia and Iran key rivals in this region Saudi Arabia has always been very worried about Iran's influence in Iraq so they see this as an opportunity to get some sort of political influence in Iraq and the Iraqis are trying to negotiate deal if that happens they'll be connected to the regional electricity grid or to alleviate some of the problems in the south but at what cost is that is it at the cost of factional izing the country between those who are loyal to Iran and those who then be loyal to Saudi Arabia that's an unseen political cost that we don't know what's going to be depends on what this deal is and you struck with Saudi Arabia unofficially the government are shutting down social media troops out on the streets in myself and they try to really contain this like I say if this becomes a big wide spread nationwide movement then that spells disaster for the government you have to realize that the government currently is still waiting for contested election results so it hasn't been able to form the new government and mucked out outside of one of the big winners in the elections the cleric and politician sent out a tweet today saying that until the protesters demands met or at least listened to we shouldn't be taking a look at forming a new coalition government we should be listening to the protesters that's an incredibly popular move by him because it plays right into the hands of his supporters and you have to remember in the South that's where he gets his support from so a lot of politics going on but again much like in Haiti as we've heard Gabrielle and other guests talk about when you talk about energy beautiful black people's lives that it affects people's lives and that's why they're taken to the streets right and taking to Twitter as well yesterday here's it says Iraq needs a fresh new start because that which happened in 2003 contributed to years of instability and weak governance hearing from a lot of Iraqis online please your comments coming but unfortunately I have to pause this part of the conversation and in the entirety of the conversation right here be sure to follow Imran on instagram at imran isms for more of his and our other correspondence reporting head over to aljazeera.com until next time we'll see you online you
