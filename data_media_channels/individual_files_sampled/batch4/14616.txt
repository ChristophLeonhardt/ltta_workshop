we in Canada allegedly live in a civilized and enlightened society but don't you dare get all preachy to those who apparently have a soft spot in their hearts for barbaric cultural practices because it turns out that even Conan has feelings too you know oh joy the Senate has approved a bill that would remove mention of barbaric cultural practices from a law that outlaws forced marriage liberal senator mabini Jaffer first introduced the bill in December 2015 shortly after the Liberals took power apparently she had trouble with the zero tolerance for barbaric cultural practices act that the previous Harper Conservative government passed into law now let's just come to a full stop right here who would take issue with proclaiming zero tolerance for acts of barbarism acts ranging from female genital mutilation and honor killings to force marriages should we have I don't know fifty percent tolerance for such acts eighty percent or in the name of complete cultural sensitivity 100 percent tolerance yeah who are we to say what's right and wrong after all now Jaffer clearly has a problem with the B word as and B for barbarism but if so why so we know that there have been forced marriages in this country ditto for FGM ditto for honor killings such barbarism no longer occupies the realm of the hypothetical and I fear given the changing demographics it's only gonna get worse as for sensitivity to other cultures does it not boil down to this if an individual doesn't want to be labeled as carrying out a barbaric cultural practice then isn't the solution crystal clear namely he or she should not embrace acts of barbarism and yes make this a condition when it comes to attaining the privilege that is Canadian citizenship so then what is Jaffer's unspoken strategy here it should be noted that Jaffer has been lauded in the past by some for hitting that triple play when it comes to the diversity sweepstakes as her bio proudly notes she is the first Muslim senator the first African born senator and the first senator of South Asian descent but old cultural practices are apparently hard to kill indeed in a speech introducing her bill jaffer said that the use of the term barbaric is actually insulting to cultures in Canada Wow however there's at least one conservative senator Selma at aloha hen who regrettably agrees with Jeff for that barbaric is a problematic word she had this to say in the Senate recently quote in my view barbaric is incendiary and deeply harmful as it targets a cultural group as a whole rather than individuals who commit the specific acts end quote yet in the final analysis which cultures find condemnation of barbaric practices problematic to use Jaffer's terminology is it perhaps members of those cultures that defend and/or practice barbaric practices is this where we have descended to in terms of mind-numbing political correctness the idea that it's now actually insensitive to call barbarism barbarism for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies like what you just saw then click subscribe below and never miss another rebel video you
