1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,420
I am here today not
because I want to be.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,390
I am terrified.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,490
I am here because I
believe it is my civic duty

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,550
to tell you what happened
to me while Brett Kavanaugh

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,330
and I were in high school.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,300
I was pushed onto the bed
and Brett got on top of me.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,880
He began running his
hands over my body

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
and grinding into me.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,856
I yelled, hoping that someone
downstairs might hear me.

10
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,230
And I tried to
get away from him,

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,270
but his weight was heavy.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,900
Brett groped me and tried
to take off my clothes.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,680
He had a hard time because
he was very inebriated

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,290
and because I was wearing
a one-piece bathing suit

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,410
underneath my clothing.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,590
I believed he was
going to rape me.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,890
I tried to yell for help.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,750
When I did, Brett put
his hand over my mouth

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,390
to stop me from yelling.

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,280
This is what
terrified me the most

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,850
and has had the most
lasting impact on my life.

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,989
It was hard for me to breathe,

23
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,620
and I thought that
Brett was accidentally

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,930
going to kill me.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,700
Both Brett and Mark
were drunkenly laughing

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,250
during the attack.

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,970
They seemed to be
having a very good time.

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,300
Mark seemed ambivalent,
at times urging Brett on,

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,350
and at times
telling him to stop.

30
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,440
A couple of times,

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,570
I made eye contact with Mark

32
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,420
and thought he
might try to help me.

33
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,660
But he did not.

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,120
During this assault,
Mark came over and

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,320
jumped on the bed twice
while Brett was on top of me.

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,010
Then the last time that he
did this, we toppled over

37
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,910
and Brett was no longer
on top of me.

38
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,180
I was able to get up
and run out of the room.

39
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,800
Directly across
from the bedroom

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,110
was a small bathroom.

41
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,100
I ran inside the bathroom
and locked the door.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,410
I waited until I heard
Brett and Mark leave

43
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,500
the bedroom laughing
and loudly walk down

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,508
the narrow stairway,
pinballing off the walls

45
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,170
on the way down.

46
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,440
I waited, and when I did
not hear them come back

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,920
up the stairs, I left
the bathroom, went down

48
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,650
the same stairwell
through the living room

49
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,750
and left the house.

50
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,240
I remember being on
the street and feeling

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,560
this enormous sense of relief
that I had escaped that house

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,900
and that Brett and Mark were
not coming outside after me.

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:00:00,000
Brettâ€™s assault on me
drastically altered my life.
