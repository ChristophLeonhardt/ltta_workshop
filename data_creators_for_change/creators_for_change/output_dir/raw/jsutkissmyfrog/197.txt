00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,300
before I don't know where you're gonna

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,370
feel the end of this video but today I'm

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,900
filming a food hall things I love about

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,010
living in<font color="#E5E5E5"> London efficiency I get places</font>

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,439
fairly fast to foursquare has become

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,939
eight times more appealing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,529
actually have more than three locations

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,900
to visit within a day the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third thing is</font>

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,250
the widespread variety and general

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,160
actual availability of organic food now

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,600
I'm not technically a vegan I'm not

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,399
technically a vegetarian I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
technically a very healthy eater but

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,730
they are things that I aspire for in

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,530
some way without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the label trying to</font>

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,239
treat my body better in some ways I am

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">also fairly dairy intolerant it's</font>

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,140
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I kind of live in denial</font>

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,510
of a lot because<font color="#E5E5E5"> chocolate but I do feel</font>

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,920
all around healthier and better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,899
get less ill if I'm not having dairy I

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,370
just wanted to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've accidentally went to this</font>

26
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,609
organic shop for a supposed to wait for

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bus watched three buses go past while</font>

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,359
I stayed in this organic shopping like

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,270
boo it's good mother earth it is by

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,040
islington station and you should go it's

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,750
really good a theme of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this food is</font>

32
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,290
things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how they taste ah</font>

33
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,970
English let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> the theme of this</font>

34
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,009
hall feats of culinary genius I didn't

35
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're possible the first one is</font>

36
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,049
organic oat drink this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> replacement</font>

37
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,640
for milk and I've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">different places for milk over the years</font>

39
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,880
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of been in</font>

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,950
denial about this for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time for</font>

41
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that absolutely in a where we've gone</font>

42
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,009
through pretty much every brand of soy

43
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,810
milk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet by the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd say</font>

44
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,460
the best for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is the test goes</font>

45
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,710
one up from value<font color="#E5E5E5"> soya milk it's like in</font>

46
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,990
a blue thing and it's the sweet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

47
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,700
and I'd say for your money downs that's

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,930
the best it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get basically</font>

49
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,729
however in the interest of research I've

50
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,920
picked this organic oat drink to see how

51
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">people make milk from oats and if it's</font>

52
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,720
the thing I've also picked up some goats

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,369
but Irma<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delamere dairy I'm not really</font>

54
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,200
sure how Darien Thomas's work completely

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,240
I've attempted to add aside many times

56
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,729
I'm not as allergic to goats cheese as I

57
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,340
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and regular cheese so I am trying</font>

58
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,590
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> goat's butter to see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

59
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">also a thing another worth of culinary</font>

60
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,860
genius on and think was possible was

61
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,810
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mediterranean organic smooth</font>

62
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,879
almond butter didn't know that was a

63
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,470
thing excited to know that it is

64
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,250
thing by the smells of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

65
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,990
feels more genuine because it's actually

66
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">really runny because you have to mix it</font>

67
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,410
softly oil separates and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things</font>

68
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,450
which makes me think normal peanut

69
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,030
butter why didn't that separate scary<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

70
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,620
bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> some perfect p and fresh mint</font>

71
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,020
soup mmm there is it really this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

72
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,610
just something that I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

73
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,870
another thing that I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know</font>

74
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,790
existed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really excited to try that</font>

75
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,660
with my vibe red ripe registering at

76
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">sauna who I now live with apparently and</font>

77
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,280
introduced me to and I really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

78
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,850
slice or two that I stole<font color="#CCCCCC"> from her so</font>

79
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,459
I'm making my an honest woman myself and

80
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,709
buying my own avocado hummus another

81
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,600
thing didn't know exist in fact let's

82
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,450
open this on camera live guys this is

83
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,120
life fun you're having looks like

84
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,760
play-doh tastes like avocado play-doh

85
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,810
does it like flubber a little bit there

86
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,250
simply put a flubber in a cheese grater

87
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,490
do you not think i also bought out by

88
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,520
the kilogram for funsies because

89
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,320
actually I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of works out</font>

90
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,110
cheaper trees saving saving the trees

91
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,480
and lastly i bought this popping a New

92
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,700
Guinea which oaths<font color="#CCCCCC"> single-origin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Arabic</font>

93
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,650
coffee now I bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it cuz it's fair</font>

94
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,900
trade for me buying coffee fair trade<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

95
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,190
actually one of the most obvious things

96
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,360
that's been around for the longest time

97
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,620
this thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> most readily available</font>

98
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,450
so owning that is actually kind of

99
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,040
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me because it's so obvious</font>

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,630
that I feel ashamed if I don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

101
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,560
clipper is a brand that I've been

102
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">drinking quite a lot of tea of lately</font>

103
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,680
and I really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

104
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,190
why not no no that's it for me who knows

105
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">what i'll be doing next door what's in</font>
