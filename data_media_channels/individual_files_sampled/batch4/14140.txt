hey everybody this is Kurt slicker and I am back again for another edition of take that with Kurt Schlichter here on the rebel rebel media your source for conservative stuff okay what a freaking amazing week it was finally after 70 years the United States of America has kept its promise and recognized Israel's capital as Israel's capital I'm talking about Jerusalem I'm talking about a promise that's been made by our Congress by president after president after President and none of them kept it to move our embassy to Jerusalem to tell the Jewish people yes we recognize that this is your homeland that you have a right to exist that you have a right to be there and the full weight credit and power of the United States of America is gonna back you well what a huge celebration for freedom what a huge celebration for Western civilization but it's got it's got even more implications than just that if that's not enormous and not the theme of President Trump or rather the theme of the people who elected President Trump because here on take that with Curt Schlichter we understand that this is not this revolution is not about donald trump donald trump is merely the avatar of this revolution he is the face of it the revolution is people american people demanding that our politicians take seriously what we demand what we've asked for what they've promised and they promised it again and again and they don't do it and moving the embassy to jerusalem has been a promise that president after president Republican and Democrat have made and probably gone to office and ignored and it's you know one of those promises that the establishment said oh yeah we'll go out and tell the rubes out there that we're gonna we're gonna stand by our ally we'll go to stand by our friend but when you get in office you know we're gonna listen to the transnational liberal elite you know the Europeans with their unfiltered cigarettes and poor personal hygiene and we are going to continue to string along our friends in Israel Donald Trump is a reaction to that because we've seen that not just involving Israel Benjamin involving all manners of politics the Republican Party will go out and it will make promise and promise and promise of conservative change and then we'll get into office and it will not do any of those things and it will take over you know the mind the body the soul as it were of good conservatives and turn them into lunatics exactly you know example Jeff Flake Jeff Flake used to be a great conservative he believed in all the stuff they went to Washington start getting written up in the Washington Post and holy cow he's a damn commie I mean it's like salt weapons ban amnesty all that Donald Trump's a reaction to that the American people were sick of it that's why he put John Trump in because we believed he would keep his word and he has and he said look I'm gonna move the embassy to Israel and he gets an office and all the best people who went to Georgetown and have a deputy influence service and the you know I've traveled many times to Belgium uh they all told Donald Trump no you can't possibly do that that was genius just can't pay him probably can't do Arabs would be upset Palestinians would be upset and Donald Trump was like no I promise we do it so we're gonna do it let's do it and he did he did oh and and you know the media freaked out the establishment freaked out the Democrats freaked out did you know there was apparently not one elected Democrat at the ceremony in Jerusalem not one now remember this had been part of their platform too but not one of them would actually go there to celebrate the friendship of the United States in Israel the Democrat Party has become an anti Israeli party you just ask them just watch their actions but it's the it's the Republican Party that was really disappointing not now because Donald Trump came through but before you know George Bush could have done this but now yeah too hard yeah all that all the smart people said no don't do it don't possibly do it it's terrible idea terrible idea to show loyalty terrible idea to be honest terrible idea to stand by your friends you know there's a problem if oil tea and honesty are considered weaknesses and that's what the establishment Republicans did I consider them weaknesses and they just didn't do them oh boy you know we got some really torn never Trump works Jennifer Rubin and all the rest of them they're like this is a terrible idea but I love the idea before but I eat it now because Trump did it but I mean it's a terrible idea now I know and they're just going crazy and you know the cruise ship is off course it's gonna hit the iceberg and the whole conservative cruise is gonna sink it's gonna be awesome so there was a reaction there's a reaction over there and it was pretty brutal you know the Palestinians led by Hamas organized by Hamas armed by Hamas decide they would stage quote-unquote protests and those protests conservative Trump consisted of trying to invade Israel okay this is a poor idea when you invade Israel yelling we're going to kill all the Jews and carrying knives and Molotov cocktails and such up you're gonna get shot and a bunch of them did get shot in fact you know a lot of them got shot and I don't care and most Americans don't care and certainly President Trump doesn't care now you can imagine D a book that first of all Jeb and I want you to you know imply the exclamation point in Jeb JEB never would have honored his promise to move the embassy to Jerusalem in the first place because all the best people would have told him no and it would have been an act of love or something that whatever Jeb's terrible but can you imagine what would happen if Jeb was in office when the Israelis acted with legitimate self-defense and killed a bunch of terrorists trying to murder the Jewish people he would have freaked out and condemned it and the Trump administration was kind of me man don't want none don't start none I don't care don't care good because we shouldn't care in fact we should support it we should support Israel 100% for using violence legitimate violence in legitimate self-defense against people who want to kill them the real animals are these Hamas cowards now the leadership of Hamas is way in the back they're not taking shot they might get they might get rocketed by the Israelis which is awesome but they're not getting shot they're gonna sense stupid people out and pay them to essentially get killed they're going to manufacture incidents for the media my favorite was like this you know news people were like filming all these you know dead bodies and also the dead bodies start moving and like you know picking their noses and stuff because it's real uncomfortable under the cloth that's my favorite they're not even good at gas lighting the Europeans freaked out of course this is terrible this is a crime the crime is paying stupid people to go do stupid things for your personal interaction that is the crime the crime is not defending your people the defend is not the crime is not defending your women and children we know what happens when the Palestinians get all of Israeli citizens they butcher them and they've done it again and again the Europeans don't care remember the Europeans are not only any Israeli they are anti Jewish make no mistake they are eager to finish the job their fellow socialist Anil Hitler started now how do I know they'll never say that out loud but how do I know that why do I think that because I watch their actions at every turn they support the people who want to kill all the Jewish people and and how do I know they walk you all the Jewish people you you listen to what they say oh yeah we don't want to drive them in the sea we want to make you know Palestine Jew free that's never going to happen these Raley's aren't going to let happen we Americans aren't gonna let happen Donald Trump is not gonna let happen if Hillary Clinton was there she might let happen yeah do you do you see Hillary Clinton backing Israel the way Donald Trump does do you see Hillary Clinton risking anything a special and fracture within her own coalition which has a huge huge number of people who hate Israelis who frankly hate Jews I mean these guys were meeting with Louis Farrakhan and they think that's okay do you see them standing up for Israel and Israel's in danger Donald Trump will the people who support Donald Trump will we will stand by our allies we will stand by our friends whether it's Israel or Poland or Great Britain or Australia or Japan we will stand by our ally South Korea we will stand by our allies because we gave our word promises made promises kept that's the theme for Donald Trump's campaign that's why Donald Trump got elected this week he kept his promise he moved the embassy to Jerusalem and he supported Israel's legitimate self-defense and I couldn't be prouder this is take that with kirt Schlichter hey everybody I'm here with Matthew Bentley author of take it away well the new book feel the Valor comes out next week but I'm also the author of what we call the Logan West series which is a series of intense emotional action-packed rollercoaster rides from Simon and Schuster so there's a lot of feelings as you're actually actually there is hugging especially in terms of honor a ask ask your better half trust me now you want to sell books right you know my audience yes I do but I try most of my people have a solid anti hugging agenda well that's okay you know you got to be secure in your manhood and in your masculine masculinity which will probably now get me all sorts of hate mail I used masculinity now you write thrillers you're you're doing the Vince Flynn Brad Thor Tom Clancy kind of thing who were you inspired by who are the guys who started you off down that road so as a kid I actually read Tom Clancy and then I also read a series by about a guy named Mack Bolan it was dawn Pennell oh my god oh my gosh what was he like in every airport a drugstore in 1977 yes they were serial novels so they were about 227 pages I believe every month and I and I read these like as a teenager which is probably why I'm a the warped and twisted individual that I am today and basically Matt would like kill mafia guys and yes this was before the dawn of modern-day terrorism as we know it today so this was basically just you know straight-up thugs yes yes you know the end they they'd all there always be a woman it was you know it was it was like knock off monthly James Bond thrillers but they were fantastic a total side note is that they had signed Bradley Cooper to play Mac Boleyn several years ago and I read an article about that a couple years ago but I'm idea you know how Hollywood is it takes years to develop a final product well you've got a Hollywood thing going I do I'm very fortunate that in addition to the books we signed an agreement with we reached an agreement with Thunder Road Pictures the same company that does the John wick series Sicario they named Braden Aftergood who did hell or high water Wind River lone survivor to name a few of his movies he some of those movies I know I think a few people have he's actually producing the movies and the intent is to make a a worldwide action franchise based on the books and they're starting with the first one they've already done what they call a treatment on the first book overwatch and we're pushing forward now look you're after you're in a space where there's a lot of conservatives and I know you're you're you're right is it ex or former Marine I perform oh great you're always a former Marine yeah yeah you've got you and you you were Reed's geez I you've got all these little things Reed's I know in fact you know it's there's a lot of nuances that were very particular we're very high maintenance I know we're just like slobs in the army we're just like yeah what there's just gonna be 20,000 of us so we're just gonna show up and win there's like 80 you guys did you show up and win and look good that's true and that you know that's half the battle well look there's something to be said for mass mass has a finesse all its own what oh well that's true overwhelming firepower is always a good thing you know nothing wrong with that let me ask you a couple things as a writer and I know personally you're kind of a conservative guy yeah you're military guy military guys are generally kind of conservative by temperament but I don't see you as a huge ideologue like well I don't know me how do you let politics get into your books okay so I I I try and actually find a balance in the stories because you know first and foremost I'm a thriller writer my my primary job is to entertain I don't care about your political background when you're reading my story I would I would love the idea of some you know very far left person to pick up my book and have a wildly entertaining time I don't know if that's gonna happen but it would be crazy it would be graded so politics like for example my fictional president is a Blue Dog Democrat and and people should know what that term means and not anymore yeah that's true nowadays that beacon sir considered like an alt right hardcore conservative I know yeah exactly but no I try to keep the politics in the books because I write intense action thrillers and I'm technically in the same category as Vince Flynn and Brad Thor I actually have the exact same editor publisher publicist as those guys but you know I I'm focusing on entertaining so the politics plays a role especially when there's some of those White House discussions but it's not a primary focus for me okay I'm more politically active as you know on Twitter when I get especially when they get my my britches up so your your goal is to make that an entertaining flight between Kansas City and Orlando absolutely you know the best feedback that I get is when people tell me Matt I picked up one of your books and next thing you know it was like 10 hours later and I hadn't slept and I was supposed to be at work and I get those emails all the time and it's the biggest form of flattery that you can get somebody lost sleep over my book you know somebody you know the the biggest form of flattery for my novels which are intensely political is pretty much I'm shiny Jeff why did you have to make Virginia part of the part of the blue states to be one of us Wow that would never happen ever everyone has hopes and dreams geez but look there there's there's something else about you that kind of distinguishes you from other thriller writers and that's the alcohol angle and you're very open about it you like a lot of us in the military we're pretty hard charged a partyer oh absolutely you know I'm fortunate that at 46 I'm now nine plus years sober but I lived life like a wild man for you know from 18 on I always did really well in school I always am an intense guy of an intense personality I used to joke that moderation was a word I couldn't spell it's true exactly I can count to 20 if I have my shoes off but you know I used to say that you know for me it was a weekend thing I was like a wild out-of-control weekend guy I managed to stay sober and that's how I really look back on it I stayed sober during the week but for 20 years I was a lunatic every weekend we always used to say that okay if we're gonna go out drinking somebody's going to go to jail something's gonna be on fire and somebody's going to be in the hospital or all three but I was fortunate that finally I managed to get my head on straight nine plus years ago I actually did it through the Marine Corps through an outpatient rehab program at Andrews Air Force Base that unless you have my problem and you're in the military you're probably not familiar with it I you know of course I was military for a long time and that that's a real a real issue in the military first of all you got a lot of hard charging intense guys guys who are always up for a challenge and you you and I both know if somebody saying I'm having a beer you know there's a lot of temptation oh yeah you're having a beer I'm a man too and I'm gonna pound them faster oh yeah oh yeah exactly it's it's just that especially in the Marine Corps it was the ultimate work hard play hard environment and for people like me with my issue that probably wasn't the best place but I still did well but you know I often joke that I've been out of the Marine Corps now since 2009 I'm probably a better officer now than when I was in you know I'm sober well look I mean you know both you and I upon do PT formations inhaled you know at 6:00 in the morning and said holy cow I'm looking out in a distillery oh absolutely yeah and that's that's a reality of light I think I think the drinking in our military has receded over time I think it was heavier when I started I'm a little older in you 1987 is when I went into basic training and then I got out in 2015 out of the reserves and I think over that time there was a definite change I think even before I got in though when even after I got in the oak Club was not the center of social life on the base as I was at when I was active duty but if you had gone ten years before I mean I got wild oh absolutely my first duty station was Camp Lejeune and I remember that yeah the oak Club there you know it was socially active I actually lived at The Bachelor officers quarters my first couple of years just down there which was right near the Oh clubs like it stumbled by instance exactly but the thing is I remember this was during commandant cruel acts tenure and I remember that the pendulum had swung a little bit towards into zero-tolerance policy towards wild out-of-control shrunken behavior although it's still what goes on obviously how high so yeah not as much I think it has at least when I was in three years ago it had definitely changed you'd have alcohol incidents that I'd have to deal with is a you know a battalion command or a deputy brigade commander but not as many as before I remember one time in Germany I got woke up in a gosh midnight and of course I was half in the bag but my troops had come back to the billets gotten in a fight over a stuffed Alf doll that's excellent I mean it was great the story's a lot longer and more in-depth ideas something over I iced tea in the future how does it how does this work in your novels though I mean how do you take this this life experience it's obviously very important to you and you're very open about it I'm not revealing secrets well when I started writing I took the adage of write what you know to heart so I literally split my personality in half and I made my protagonist Logan West like the intense angry violent side of me when you meet him on page one he is emerging from a blackout relapse to confront a mercenary sent by a Mexican cartel to retrieve something in his home in Annapolis that's like page one of my first novel so you're not you're not spending a lot of time setting up the fields yeah well no no no that takes I do that all through internal dialogue and actually it even takes place throughout the action sequences but then the other side of me is the John quick side he's kind of Logan's sidekick his former platoon sergeant from force reconnaissance company and he's the the guy that you know and talked to which is the self-deprecating sarcastic guy that I am on a day-to-day basis so it wasn't for me it was very easy to write those two characters and you know it's like I'm having a conversation in my head and I'm just putting it on paper and at least I'm not having that conversation out loud or people might get concerned okay and in the new one how have you developed the characters you had si names here both seven times according to seven times so the first one was overwatch that came out in 2016 right that was my debut novel and that was actually named a top ten book of the Year by the Military Times and it was also nominated for a berry Award for Best Overall thriller no second the second book oath of Honor came out in 2017 and that I picked up two years after the events of overwatch and I introduced two new characters that people absolutely are head over heels for and then the third book field of Valor picks up six months after the events of oath of Honor and that's the one that comes out in the hardcover on 22 May interesting yes and then I'm working right now on the fourth book for 2019 and then I also have books five and six already planned in my head as well well that sounds awesome okay Matt well I appreciate you coming on here and talking about this stuff but I now have to ask you important question what's the most conservative animal dog or cat Oh dog hands-down see say I'm a dog guy okay yes I'm I'm gonna discuss that a little later in the podcast I think I'm gonna get a lot of grief but I don't care I'm gonna fight the power I know unfortunately I think that's right but but the big question is are there more cat or dog videos on the Internet I don't know well you know I think it's a conservative medium I think it's puppies so anyway thanks a lot Matt everybody go out and get field of Valor oh and and please follow me on Twitter I also have a Facebook page yeah Matthew Bentley it's pretty easy and then there's a Facebook fan page and again the book the paperback of oath of Honor just came out a few weeks ago and again the hardcover comes out just before Memorial Day all except I buy everything okay hey you bet okay that was my chat with my pal Matthew Bentley I'm back I've got my my microphone again we are ready to do important things talk about the most important issue of the day now we've already talked about how it's important to keep promises we've already talked with Matthew Bentley let's let's focus on some of its that's transcends all those which is the most conservative animal is it the cat or the dog well let me rephrase that is it the lowly sinister feline or the loyal prowl dog gee I think I vote dog look let's get real about this because you know there's a lot of fighting on Twitter about this what is the most conservative animal and it's very very clear that the most conservative animal is the loyal canine dogs are cool I have a dog I have a legendary dog my legendary dog's name is bitey hopefully there's a picture of it that will magically appear while we're here what unknowable beast by D is by T earns its keep now I I refer to by Diaz it because I don't want to miss gender by T because it's important that I don't you know impose my view of what biteys gender is on by t because that's a thing of some sort among dogs in social justice warriors but anyway by t is a noble creature by t provides value besides being beautiful and fun to pet because by T while I'm writing by T will come up against me and you know sit there and it is relaxing to stroke by T and pet by T not so relaxing what by t decides to chew on me but you know by t understands the teeth are important my t understands that violence properly used is an important tool for doing justice that's why dogs have teeth now about cats you ever see a cat attack anybody I mean they kind of scratch at them but you know really they're kind of cats or you know cancer kind of pacifists cats are kind of liberal they're you know they're the dogs going out with the tooth equivalent of an ar-15 cat cats going around with the equivalent of you know a whistle you know remember how social justice warriors and anti-gun people think that the way to protect yourself from you know attackers is to have a whistle instead of a 357 Magnum those are cat people as a cat thing cats are also sly and cunning and deceitful they're pretty much Chuck Schumer with fur which is an image that gosh I just hope I can somehow banish for my thoughts but they're like the Mean Girls of animals they're conniving they're sneaky the dog dog has no guile dog just comes up to you and you pet the dog and you'll like the doggy dog is what the dog says dog promises made promises kept that's a dog cat cannot lie to your face cats are lawyers cats a lawyer doing workers comp cases from a van down by the river that's what a cat is sneaky conniving have you ever seen a cat add value to anything oh well it catches mice that's a myth okay cats don't catch mice as a habit as a rare occurrence but bitey barks said everything by T is a walking security system besides having sharp little fangs anytime a threat approaches our house bitey goes crazy you got by yeah small children squirrels other tiny dogs bitey is there to defend bitey is adding value by T is a security system a weapon ready to fight to defend by D's family cat cats like I'm out of here I'm done cat is not gonna caddy nothing for you a cat is parasite cat adds no value it's like a Democrat voter cat is a welfare cheat okay cat is a they're just they're just awful Krita now look admittedly they are soft and occasionally cuddling all right but you know occasionally a liberal is - I mean you know mostly in a comedy kind of way I mean like you want to laugh at a little bit you know a dog though dogs dogs are noble beasts cats are just cats are just a mess why would you want a cat if you are conservative you need a dog variant you need - dogs are like the ar-15s of animals and cats are like the you know whistles they're almost useless now this is just my view I don't know what you think but I'd like to know what you think I'd like some feedback you could comment here on the rebel and tell me why you think cats are conservative and I'll laugh at you because you're wrong or you can talk to me on Twitter at Kurt Schlichter kor TSE h li CH ter it spelled exactly how it sounds and you look for the hashtag caring and you can come on there and you can go what what the hell was that why would you think that cats are not conservative let me list the reasons why and then you run out of characters and it's fine or you do like a 50 you know a 50 tweet thread on why cats are better than dogs and more conservative I don't care look I'm all about free speech so I'd like to hear from you in any case that's my take that for this week we've covered important subjects like promises many promises kept stand by your allies and works of Matthew Bentley and the most important issue why dogs are more conservative than cats so anyway come along and join me next week here on take that and we will do this all again thank you very much
