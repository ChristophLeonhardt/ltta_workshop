AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
HEY, GEN.
>> NEIL, GOOD MORNING TO YOU
FROM SINGAPORE.
THE LATEST THAT WE'RE LEARNING
IS THAT THE PRESIDENT MOVED HIS
DEPARTURE UP IS THAT KIM
JONG-UN'S DELIGATION IS THAT HE
WOULD BE LEAVING THIS AFTERNOON.
THE PRESIDENT RESERVED WEDNESDAY
MORNING FOR TALKS IF NECESSARY.
SO HE DECIDED IF KIM IS LEAVING,
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME TO HANG
AROUND.
SO HE'S GOING OUT AT 7:00 P.M.
AFTER A 4:00 P.M. PRESS
CONFERENCE.
12 HOURS FROM NOW NEW YORK
SOMETIME.
SO IF YOU WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY, SET YOU
ALARM CLOCKS.
THAT'S WHEN THE HE WILL BE
SPEAKING.
OFFER KIM JONG-UN IN THEIR VERY
FIRST HISTORIC BILATERAL MEETING
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND A
NORTH KOREAN LEADER.
HE HAS ECONOMIC GUARANTEES FOR
KIM ON THE TABLE.
HE HAS SECURITY GUARANTEES,
POTENTIAL END TO THE KOREAN WAR
AFTER IT'S BEEN UNDER AN
ARMISTICE FOR ALL OF THESE
DECADES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
NORTH KOREA.
THIS IS A BIG IF, IF NORTH KOREA
AND KIM JONG-UN ARE WILLING TO
GIVE UP THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
THE PRESIDENT CHANGING UP THE
PARADIGM.
IT WON'T BE INCREMENTAL.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS IRREVERSIBLE
AND VERIFIABLE DENUCLEARIZATION
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
WHAT IS INTERESTING, THE FIRST
MEETING WILL BE BETWEEN
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN
ONE-ON-ONE WITH ONLY THEIR
TRANSLATORS PRESENT, UNLIKE THIS
BIG MEETING THAT YOU SEE HERE
WITH SINGAPORE'S PRIME MINISTER.
THERE'S THE PRESIDENT WITH PRIME
MINISTER LEE.
KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYS THAT'S THE
WAY THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO DO
THINGS, MAN ON MAN.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS VERY CLEAR
THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO MEET
ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE OTHER
PRINCIPAL HERE.
THIS IS THE WAY THE PRESIDENT
HAS DONE BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER.
IT MAY STRIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE PAST
AS AN UNUSUAL REQUEST.
BUT REMEMBER, WE'RE LOOKING AT
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FRAMING.
>> AND KIM JONG-UN TAKING IN THE
SIGHTS OF SINGAPORE LAST NIGHT.
ONE OF THE PLACES HE VISITED IS
THE MARINA BAY SANDS HOTEL AND
CASINO.
YOU CAN SEE KIM WALKING AROUND.
THIS IS THE FARTHEST THAT HE'S
EVER BEEN OUTSIDE OF PYONGYANG
AS THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA.
THE MARINA BASED SANDS, THE
ICONIC STRUCTURE NOW ON THE
SINGAPORE SKYLINE.
THERE'S THREE HIGH RISE TOWERS
AND HOTELS AND SOMETHING SPREAD
ACROSS THE TOP OF IT THAT LOOKS
LIKE A CARGO SHIP THAT LANDED UP
THERE.
ITS OWNED BY SHELDON ADDLESON,
THE LAS VEGAS CASINO MAGNET.
SO KIM JONG-UN GETTING A LOOK AT
WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE IF HE
GETS ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR THE
UNITED STATES.
ONE THING I SHOULD SAY, WHILE
THE PRESIDENT IS SET TO GO AT
7:00, WE'RE TOLD THE DEPARTURE
