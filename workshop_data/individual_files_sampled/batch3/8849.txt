SOUTH KOREA. WHAT MORE ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT THE NORTH KOREAN TESTING SITE. TRACE, WE’RE AWAITING THE FIRST IMAGES FROM THE CLOSURE OF THAT NUCLEAR TEST SITE. WE’RE TOLD MAYBE THEY WILL COME IN ABOUT THREE HOURS TIME. AS YOU NOTED, THERE WERE INVITED FOREIGN JOURNALISTS AT THE SCENE. THEY’RE MAKING THEIR WAY BACK FROM THE FAR NORTHEAST CORNER DOWN TO AN EASTERN COASTAL CITY ON A VERY SLOW TRAIN RIDE. NORTH KOREA DOES IN FACT CLAIM THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE DISMANTLEMENT OF THE SITE. THERE WAS AN EXPLOSIVE CLOSURE OF THE TUNNELS THAT WERE USED NO THE PAST SIX NUCLEAR TESTS. THOSE ON THE GROUND SAID IT WAS SPECTACULAR A FORCEFUL BLAST. AS YOU NOTED THERE WERE NO INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS ALLOWED AT THE SCENE. THERE’S TO BE A P.R.

THEY’VE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF FINDING A DIPLOMATIC RESOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS. IT WAS SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON AND KIM JONG-UN THAT MET ON APRIL 27th IN THEIR OWN SUMMIT ALONG THE DMC. THIS WHITE HOUSE SUMMIT CANCELLATION SEEMS TO STAND FROM A STATEMENT ISSUED EARLIER THURSDAY BY THE KIM JONG-UN REGIME TALKING ABOUT A POSSIBLE NUCLEAR SHOW DOWN RATHER THAN A MEETING IN A MEETING ROOM. SO FAR AT LEAST AS YOU NOTE, WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING BACK FROM NORTH KOREA AND WHETHER THEY WILL RESPOND AND MAYBE AGREE WITH THE UNITED STATES TO RESPOND THE CORRECT WAY. WE’LL SEE. BACK TO YOU. RIGHT. PRESIDENT MOON SAID A FEW DAYS AGO HERE IN WASHINGTON, IT WAS
