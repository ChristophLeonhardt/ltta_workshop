a Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio the Trump administration has rolled out their anti opioid epidemic commercials and they're getting mixed reviews let's first take a look at one of these ads first time I tried vicodin he was laying around my mom's house then I kept taking him whenever I could get him I didn't know they'd be this addictive I mean know how far I'd go to get more opioid dependence can happen after just five days know the truth spread the truth so there was that there was at least one big fan of the rollout that's President Trump himself who said this of the ads let's take a look at this clip I've been very strongly in favor of spending a lot of money on great commercials showing how bad it is so that kids seeing those commercials during the right shows on television or wherever the Internet when they see these commercials they I I don't want any part of it it's the least expensive thing we can do where you scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials and they are truly graphic and scary there are four ads that they're rolling out and in each of these four ads they depict the true story of someone hurting themselves to get more pain medication a little bit more on just the back story of these ads the White House Office of a National Drug Control Policy partnered with two nonprofits the truth initiative in the Ad Council in order to create the advertisements that ad space will cost thirty million dollars according to an official with the Ad Council in the White House told reporters on Thursday they will only spend three hundred and eighty four thousand dollars on the campaign the rest will be aided by donations organized I organized reportedly tested over a hundred and fifty different images before settling on the for advertisements chosen no Trump obviously really liked them but there are a lot of other people that are saying that these are not effective advertisements who does not know at this moment after 22 years of an epidemic that these drugs are addictive said Keith Humphries a drug policy expert at Stanford University and former senior policy adviser for the White House Office of Drug Control Drug Control Policy they don't give information they are just trying to terrify everyone and I think people are already terrified this is reminiscent of the just say no campaigns and I think that there has been enough evidence to show that that actually really backfired and a lot of experts are saying that these White House ads are going to do the same you guys have seen the ads or at least one of them that we just played what is your response to this I mean this isn't even a bandaid on a gushing wound the ad that we did watch completely misleads people into I mean it shows that this administration does not understand they fundamentally misunderstand maybe purposely so how this epidemic came about in the first place Oh Trump with his big talk about how he's gonna be this tough guy on the pharmaceutical companies this is a problem that emerged from pharmaceutical companies that pushed doctors to overprescribe incredibly addictive opioids and people would get prescribed these drugs for legitimate reasons for legitimate pain that they were suffering from an invasive surgery or an injury and they would get addicted because that's what happens with opioids they get addicted and so it doesn't happen because there's some black guy who's stealing drugs from his mom and then he gets addicted that way no no that is not indicative of the trend that the country experienced with opioids and by the way in case you didn't know this is a problem that has disproportionately impacted poor white communities just want to put that out there when I saw the black guy I had the very that same thought that anti just articulate it was wow really I mean statistically it's a white problem I mean that's not to say that that guy I mean who they are depicting dramatically wasn't an african-american I'm just saying that it was an odd choice now maybe the other ones be the other ones do depict more more varied demographic but in the one that I showed yeah so maybe to be fair jumping on the wrong thing but but of course opioids are out there in such great numbers because of the pharmaceuticals in there and their stranglehold on our culture the real answer to this isn't isn't ads look I'm not I'm not against those ads I'm not it's like oh you know it's a total waste I don't know maybe it gets okay by it's certainly not the answer is my it's not a real it's not really addressing the problem I mean it's it's again to what you're saying Anna that it's not even a band-aid I mean the problem the intervention that's required the the things that have to happen to really begin to stem this tide are far more substantial than even all the ads you want to produce you know now until the end of time if I were someone who were addicted to opioids and I saw those commercials I would be insulted because it makes you seem as though you're this irresponsible person you're just an addict who can't contain control of your own life and that you'll go to extreme measures just to get your hands on this drug to get your fix that is not what happened to the vast majority of Americans who are addicted to prescription painkillers it happened because of a lack of regulation pharmaceutical companies that have run amok and what these people need is not to be demonized okay I don't care what the race is that doesn't matter at all they need treatment they need help and that is not what they're getting here fear-mongering is not going to help anything I went through the DARE program throughout grade school and guess what I did drugs I didn't do drugs throughout school but I'd ended up trying marijuana that didn't stop me and there was all sorts of fear-mongering about marijuana the DARE program was a giant waste of federal resources and that is exactly what we're seeing here it is not even a band-aid for this gushing wound it is nothing more than Trump making it appear that he cares about the situation he doesn't care if he genuinely did he would create treatment programs that really help these people in addition to pushing for regulation yeah I think that's just that's that's a great point Anna something that I keep being reminded of is this who does this ad play well to and it plays well to people in Congress over the age of 50 who have probably never firsthand experienced any sort of opioid addiction or dependence in their lifetime and they would watch I mean like oh yeah that would really scare me I'm never gonna touch percocet so who worked on me so that's probably good but when you look at the experts who have been extensively interviewed they say this absolutely has the adverse effect and again pointing to to just say no program that's never saying no has never been really the core problem that we're here to talk about so just say no to who the the doctor who's prescribing you this medication for the extreme pain that you're feeling is that who you say no to I mean and remember there were studies recently that showed that these opioids were no better at treating pain compared to other over-the-counter non-addictive pain medications look there are serious issues the pharmaceutical companies Trump said that he would hold their feet to the fire again with his tough-guy language never really gets implemented when it comes to those in positions of power it never gets implemented when it comes to corporations and you know the the people that he gave Hillary Clinton crap for no the same corporations that he felt we're controlling Hillary Clinton they're controlling you homeboy so okay so my final question for you guys a tone-deaf ad like this that just really I think we can agree misses the mark is this intentional or is it ignorant is it is it his intent to just sort of smoke and mirrors away from Big Pharma's we've talked about or is it just ignorant in that that he the advisors surrounding him are not giving him the information he needs to make an informed decision on a problem that he says he deeply cares about I think the evidence is pretty clear as to what's needed I mean you know this has been a problem that has been talked about and reviewed and statistically analyzed in many many different ways to the past administration this didn't just happen when Trump took office we're awash in these are opioids for the reasons that that have been articulated here already that Big Pharma has got a stranglehold on everybody and so the answers here so whether or not Trump is willfully and denial of the answers I don't think he cares I really don't think he cares you saw I think I bring me something to show that we're let's get on top of this come on bring me some I think he's he's completely surface on this yes he has no clue nor does he have any he's not anxious to get a clue on it two easy ways for the Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down
