>> TWO MORE WORKING DAYS UNTIL

00:00:02,691 --> 00:00:03,024
MONDAY.

3
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:04,091
>> IN YOUR JOB, YES.

4
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,595
HAVE FUN.

5
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:07,329
THANK YOU, JOHN ROBERTS.

6
00:00:07,329 --> 00:00:08,864
>> Jon: WELL, BACK IN THE

7
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:10,432
NATION'S CAPITOL, THINGS ARE

8
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:12,033
BOILING ONCE AGAIN.

9
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:15,136
HOUSE REPUBLICANS, DEVIN NUNES

00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:16,771

11
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:17,772
SENIOR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

OFFICIALS LOOKING FOR CLASSIFIED

13
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:22,711
DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE RUSSIA

14
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:23,712
INVESTIGATION.

15
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:26,882
KIM STRASSEL WRITING AN OP-ED IN

16
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:28,216
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."

17
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:38,393
IT READS --

18
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:49,771
>> Jon: THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

19
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,140
IS PUSHING BACK ON THE NARRATIVE

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,475
TELLING FOX NEWS THAT THEY ONLY

21
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:55,210
BRIEFED THE LAWMAKERS AND DID

22
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,513
NOT REVEAL ANY SOURCES OR LEFT

23
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:01,616
THEM READ ACTUAL DOCUMENTS.

24
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:04,653
KIM STRASSEL, "WALL STREET

25
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:05,554
JOURNAL" AND FOX NEWS

26
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:06,788
CONTRIBUTOR JOINS US NOW.

27
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:08,657
ONE OF THOSE STUNNING

28
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:09,591
REVELATIONS THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT

29
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,893
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE OUR

30
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:13,194
VIEWERS TO CHECK OUT YOUR PIECE

31
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:14,563
IN THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"

32
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:16,565
ONE OF THOSE REVELATIONS IS YOU

33
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:18,433
SAY THE FBI OUTRIGHT HID

34
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:21,403
DOCUMENTS FROM CONGRESSIONAL

35
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:21,836
INVESTIGATORS.

36
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:24,005
>> WELL, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

37
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:26,441
HI, JON, BY THE WAY.

38
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,376
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO

39
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:31,713
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN WHO IN A PRESS

40
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:33,648
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY POINTED OUT

41
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:35,917
THAT THIS REQUEST BY DEVIN NUNES

42
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,852
AND TREY GOWDY WAS WHOLLY

43
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:38,820
APPROPRIATE AND WITHIN THE SCOPE

44
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,556
OF THEIR ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

45
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:43,592
FRANKLY, SHOULD HAVE BEEN

46
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:45,293
ANSWERED QUITE A WHILE AGO.

47
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,595
THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING

48
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,129
WHATEVER THIS IS ENTIRELY

49
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:50,065
RELEVANT TO THE LONG-STANDING

50
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:50,932
PROBE THAT THE HOUSE

51
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:52,467
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN

52
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,536
CONDUCTING INTO THE FBI'S

53
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:56,571
HANDLING OF THE RUSSIA COLLUSION

54
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:57,005
INVESTIGATION.

55
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:59,274
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE JUSTICE

56
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:00,375
DEPARTMENT, THEY KNEW FULL WELL

57
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,611
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE HANDED

58
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:03,812
OVER WHATEVER IT IS THAT THESE

59
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:06,181
TWO MEN ARE SEEKING, ALL THE WAY

60
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,350
BACK LAST SUMMER WHEN THEY WERE

61
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,818
REQUESTED FOR DOCUMENTS IN

62
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:10,151
AUGUST.

63
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:11,920
>> Jon: BUT THE FBI HAS BEEN

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,488
STONE-WALLING OR CONCEALING WHAT

65
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:14,589
THEY HAVE, RIGHT?

66
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:17,192
>> WELL, FOR MONTHS NOW, LOOK

67
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,660
HOW THEY HANDLED THE INITIAL

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,027
SUBPOENA.

69
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:20,996
THEY IGNORED IT AND DELAYED.

70
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:23,198
REMEMBER, ALL OF THE EXCUSES.

71
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:24,933
THIS COULD HARM NATIONAL

72
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:26,167
SECURITY, THIS COULD UNDERMINE

73
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,469
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

74
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:28,837
INTELLIGENCE PARTNERS WHAT WE

75
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:30,271
HAVE SEEN SO FAR SHOW THAT NONE

76
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,339
OF THAT IS THE CASE.

77
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:33,475
WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY HIDING

78
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:35,076
WERE REVELATIONS THAT WERE

79
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:36,945
HUGELY EMBARRASSING TO THE

80
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:37,278
ANYBODY.

81
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,813
FOR INSTANCE, THE FACT THAT THEY

82
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:40,815
DIDN'T FULLY INFORM THE FISA

83
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:43,418
COURT ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS

84
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:46,554
BASING ITS SURVEILLANCE WARRANT

85
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:47,756
ON INFORMATION THAT CAME FROM

86
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,524
THE RIVAL PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

87
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:51,092
>> Jon: AND THE INDICATIONS ARE

88
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,293
THAT THE FBI HAD A SOURCE WITHIN

89
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:54,496
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT WAS

90
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:55,363
FEEDING THEM INFORMATION?

91
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,831
>> WELL, AT LEAST INTERACTING

92
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:57,899
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

93
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,968
WHAT WE KNOW FROM A LEAK THAT

94
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,537
APPEARS TO HAVE COME FROM LAW

95
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:04,039
ENFORCEMENT IS THAT THEY'RE

96
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,940
REQUESTING INFORMATION ABOUT A

97
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,274
SOURCE.

98
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:07,409
THAT TERM IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

99
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,778
WHEN THE FBI TALKS ABOUT A

100
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:10,912
SOURCE, THEY TALK ABOUT SOMEONE

101
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:12,414
THAT IS YOUR AVERAGE CITIZEN

102
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:14,449
THAT USES THEIR CREDENTIALS OR

103
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:16,551
THEIR JOB AS A WAY OF SPYING FOR

104
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:17,619
THE AGENCY.

105
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:20,188
SO WE CAN TAKE THAT TO MEAN THAT

106
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:22,357
THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT WAS

107
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:23,558
INTERACTING WITH THE TRUMP

108
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:24,993
CAMPAIGN IN SOME WAY AND

109
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:26,294
REPORTING BACK TO THE FBI.

110
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:28,930
WHICH MEANS THE FBI WAS USING

111
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,633
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO SPY ON A

112
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:32,600
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

113
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,735
>> Jon: THAT GOES BACK TO THE

114
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:36,738
WHOLE UNMASKING CONTROVERSY.

115
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,773
THE FBI ONLY MASKS THOSE NAMES

116
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:41,609
BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT

117
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:42,877
THE INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE

118
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,779
FOUND THAT IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO

119
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,382
WHATEVER THEY'RE INVESTIGATING.

120
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,817
WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

121
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:52,754
THEN UNMASKS THOSE NAMES, IT WAS

122
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,255
ESSENTIALLY REVEALING

123
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:56,391
INFORMATION THAT THE FBI HAD

124
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:57,892
ALREADY DEEMED WAS NOT RELEVANT.

125
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,594
>> WELL, THESE ARE PROTECTIONS

126
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:00,895
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR

127
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:02,797
AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO ARE

128
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:04,032
INTERACTING WITH FOREIGNERS.

129
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:06,434
WE'RE ALLOWED TO KEEP TRACK OF

130
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:07,936
WHAT THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IS

131
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:08,803
SAYING ON A PHONE.

132
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,238
WE HAVE THOSE SPYING TOOLS.

133
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:13,041
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE USING

134
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,777
THOSE TOOLS TO OBSERVE

135
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:16,144
AMERICANS.

136
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:17,812
SO WE MASK THOSE NAMES.

137
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:19,547
WE HAD THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

138
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:20,915
UNMASKING, WE NOW KNOW THAT

139
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,484
THERE WAS A SURVEILLANCE WARRANT

140
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:24,419
AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP

141
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:24,786
CAMPAIGN.

142
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,155
WE NOW BELIEVE BASED ON THIS

143
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:29,457
THAT THEY POTENTIALLY HAD HUMAN

144
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:30,525
PEOPLE SPYING.

145
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,961
THIS IS AMAZING AND OUTRAGEOUS

146
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,796
STUFF, ESPECIALLY THIS IS A

147
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:35,396
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.

148
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,499
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SUPPOSED TO

149
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,968
TREAD CAREFULLY SO THAT THEY

150
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,136
INFLUENCING OR GETTING INVOLVED

151
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:42,270
IN AN ELECTION.

152
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,472
>> Jon: SO MY FINAL QUESTION, IF

153
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,940
YOU COULD ASK ONE QUESTION OF

154
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,544
THE FBI AND GET AN ANSWER TO IT,

155
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:50,245
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

156
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:53,414
>> WELL, IT WOULD BE FOR THIS

157
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:56,551
NAME AND TO COME CLEAN ABOUT

158
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:58,419
EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN

159
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,088
TERMS OF ALL OF ITS SURVEILLANCE

160
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,590
AND MONITORING AND INVESTIGATION

161
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,825
OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

162
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:07,061
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO SEE

163
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:07,629
THIS.

164
00:05:07,629 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Jon: HER PIECE IS ENTITLED
