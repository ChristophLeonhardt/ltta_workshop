I also wanted to stress how petty this plan is because we told you about some of the the effectively extra taxes that you would end up having to pay when you know they take away some of your ability to deduct state and local taxes and things like that these are huge things that they're using to pay for these tax cuts for the corporations and the wealthy things like the extra tax on University endowment income and then it gets so petty and actually counterproductive to the supposed ideological goals of the Republican Party so first petty they're going to be doing an additional tax on graduate student stipends because they just hate people who pursue education but then the counterproductive these every one of the people who's gonna end up voting for this on the Republican side would label themselves pro-life they don't want you to get an abortion they want you to have the kid and preferably keep it but if not at least have it put it up for adoption and how do we encourage that we take away the tax break when you adopt a child that's literally in the bill how petty is that then like they're gonna screw up the economy and they want you to be willing to make sacrifices to work ok it's important that you work but you better work close by because if you move somewhere for a job they're taking away your tax incentives for the money you spent to relocate for that job that's how small and petty they're willing to be to pay for these we have one example of the things that they're cutting that would affect regular people just give me one I'll be back I'll give you a bored one later I mean other than the poor you just gave give me one so it look I have seen the poll numbers it's it's at 25 percent and so look 40 percent so I made up their minds it's a big number but overall people aren't buying it because and this is same thing that happened with the Republican health care plan they're like yeah yeah I mean it's one thing when you say strong borders and and you and the Muslims are scary I got you but now this is this looks like a clear giveaway to the rich I don't get it you guys are admitting that it could raise taxes on the middle class I thought I was gonna give a tax cut now you're telling me no the taxpayers are going to go to corporations the rich and then you have to pay by raising my taxes what the just happened yeah no I vote no right and so this is amazing because this is almost unfuckable because every donor in the country wants us not everybody almost like all the Republicans it is their only goal is Republican donors and they've said it publicly if they don't get this for us that's it we're gonna stop funding them because that's the whole point of the bribes is to get the trillions of dollars in tax cuts so and half the Democratic donors are like well we want you to be nice to black people and gay people but get us the tax cuts so if they can't get this done they can't get anything done and they're and they're on the precipice of screwing it up and part of the reason it's Trump because he is so grotesquely incompetent he apparently can't get anything done and the other reason is they're too greedy they're like no no I'm not even like normally the trick is we give the middle class a tiny tax cut and then we give the rich a giant tax cut this time they're like now it let's just raise taxes on the middle class and give even more the rich well you jumped a shark and so people are like no no wait a minute then this isn't cute anymore they're both it's the greediness combined with the arrogance because the reason that they have to they can't do the typical way that you're laying out is the bird rule that they can only add so much to the deficit with this to be able to pass it with 51 votes now if they were willing to give some of the conservative Democrats something some reason to come on board so they could get nine of them or whatever then they wouldn't know they wouldn't have to do it in this way they could do it in a typical way but they're so uninterested in any bipartisanship even with the most conservative Democrats that they refuse to do that and they might sink the entire thing for that reason what do we think I get asked this by one of my Republican friends who's you know who likes us right but but it's definitely Republican like he's like he would say now so what they're just Machiavellian and evil like you know so so so okay so when buddy Carter Kevin Brady get together and smile at each other they go to dinner they have a smiling contest like you got great teeth you have great teeth like what do they think they're doing are they like I think we get to give Exxon its money no they gotta have some there's something that they think this will help do they think it'll help the economy they think it's good for America oh yeah look guys that's actually I actually think that's a super easy answer people will get themselves to believe anything yep as long as it is to their benefit and usually for their financial benefit and look they're we this is not a perfect example but Ana the other day was talking about the study we did covered on the show where they were paint playing Monopoly and they told people are we're gonna cheat you're gonna player X is going to have more money and have all these different advantages and when player X one he'd be eating more nuts than the other guys and he changed yeah and he was convinced that it was he won because he was awesome even though they told everyone including him yeah we are cheating on your behalf right okay and his name Donald Trump jr. or Hillary Clinton anyway so no they get them selves to believe it there's a million excuses they if you ask them this guy of course it creates jobs okay they never even bothered me game plan before going on that press conference wait how does it create jobs because they don't care that it creates jobs it's not their actual goal that was her actual goal if it was me and I'm a senator and I go wait guys all right you're saying let's take a progressive thing this somehow creating Medicare for all is gonna create jobs what would I do I would ask how and then somebody would get into an explanation they say well when you take the health care cost away from the companies they could actually use it to hire more people go oh okay great then when I'm in a press conference I would know how right they don't even bother looking into it because they're like create jobs good enough alright where's the check so but then but that's so they think so they do they think it's gonna create jobs yeah yeah I think they genuinely believe it right at all and it's a spectrum you know like you've got you've got sophisticated people like Dick Cheney did he really think we're gonna liberate Iraq right Hey but Bush you know he probably talked bushes up liberate that sounds good I laugh liberating people that involves freedom right right so it says it's a spectrum and I'm being too light on Bush there because I think Bush knew some of the stuff too but but most of it I would guess 80% of it is people who were like yeah yeah yeah sure yeah that'll work alright alright yeah
