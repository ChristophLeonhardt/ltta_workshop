News journalists have rounded on the Ukrainian authorities for faking the assassination of a Russian opposition reporter in Kiev international media and security watchdogs have slammed the stunt as deplorable and regrettable the staged murder of journalist arkady bob tinker by the ukrainian security service is distressing while the reappearance with the reporter may be a great relief it is deeply regrettable the ukraine's authorities have played with the truth no matter what their motive relieved that arkady bob chenko is alive I deplore the decision to spread false information on the life of a journalist it is the duty of the state to provide correct information to the public well earlier the Ukrainian authorities had claimed that they'd found Russian journalists Accardi Bob chenko with gunshot wounds in his flat in the capital it was claimed that he died on his way to hospital however late it was revealed that the murder had been staged apparently in order to foil an actual Russian plot to kill the journalist Accardi babichenko is a prominent Kremlin critic who's condemned Russian activities in Ukraine and Syria he is a contributor to four major UK news outlets like the Guardian and also the BBC artist on quarter reports now on the fallout of the controversial case when a Russian journalist was pronounced murdered in the Ukrainian capital it didn't take long for the ceremonial finger-pointing at Russia to begin he was only working on things that were critical and investigative of Russia and of the Russian government as well he said there was nothing that was critical of the Ukrainians of course that Network and its boss placing the blame on the Kremlin and on Russia journalists known political leanings have led some to point the finger in one direction it was a calculated deliberate international terrorist crime committed on the direct instruction of the Russian authorities who can blame them when the story has all the perfect ingredients the Russian totalitarian machine Putin's regime going after the Kremlin critic except the guy turned up alive and well imagine everyone's confusion what on earth is going on Fred these developments in just the last hour or so I know left us absolutely gobsmacked wait a second so what the heck actually happened here Russia said it was relieved that arkady bob chenko is alive but also furious and understandably so after being falsely accused of murder questions of life and death in ukraine as well as the international community's trust in its politics are nothing more than the bargaining chip for the caves regime to stir up anti-russian hysteria Bob janko's fellow journalists were outraged too when estates as a prominent journalist who had received threats was murdered I think the media have to report it but with their fake news Bob Schenker in Ukraine have reduced all of our credibility Trump would be proud had learned not to trust Ukrainian authorities on Donbass war info but assumed on something like this official confirmation was solid apologies it's on Wikipedia's most notable fake deaths so what gives well the murder was staged by the Ukrainian Secret Service to foil an alleged Kremlin plot they say they did it secretly not even his wife knew imagine what the poor woman went through but one Ukrainian lawmaker thinks this is okay because Sherlock Holmes successfully used the method of staging his own death to effectively investigate difficult and complicated crimes well if it happened in fiction must be good in real life too whether Ukraine will produce evidence that there was ever a Russian plot in the first place remains to be seen but after a stunt like this it's hard to imagine many will take anything Kiev says at face value the timing is key I think just before we start the World Cup in Russia which is a showcase event for any country that holds a little cup that hosts the World Cup and suddenly we're getting these stories which is dessert but you are designed I would speculate to discredit Russia and discredit Russia and the eyes of the world just as it's about to host the World Cup and so this is a very lamentable campaign that's been targeting Russia because it's now interfering in areas in which
