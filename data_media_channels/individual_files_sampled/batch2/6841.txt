on Wednesday Donald Trump felt the need to once again remind the world that he's a very intelligent person on the South Lawn of the White House when reporters approached him they essentially were asking about his lack of civility both on Twitter and in person when dealing with members of his own party and members of the opposition party here is what Trump replied to those reporters questions with he said well I think the press makes me more uncivil than I am you know people don't understand I went to an Ivy League college I was a nice student I did very well I'm a very intelligent person okay first and foremost mr. Trump if you are in fact a very intelligent person you don't have to go around reminding people of that because your words and actions will do the talking for you second of all did you ever get around to challenging Rex Tillerson to that IQ test did did that ever happen because I am dying to know the results of that furthermore this is about the third or fourth time in just the last 18 months that Donald Trump has had to come out and remind people that he is a very intelligent person he's got a very good brain those were his words a very good brain at one point he told us that no no you don't and I don't know how to really sugarcoat that any better you're a very stupid person mr. Trump how do we know this well because we can listen to you because we can watch you we can see how you act and react in certain situations and you have never done a single thing as president or candidate or hell even as a businessman that would indicate that you have any kind of intelligence that would make you stand out from the rest of the country now I'm not saying there's something you know lacking in your intelligence I'm just saying you're probably at most very average I would like to go a little further than that but I'm gonna keep it civil here regardless Trump and continues to insist that he is a very intelligent person why most likely because he personally feels that he is lacking in that particular mental arena so he feels the need to constantly not necessarily reassure the public or the press but reassure himself that is a common psychological tactic he repeats something so many times not because he wants others to believe it but because he himself wants to believe it and I think that is actually what we're seeing here when you look at it that way it's actually a very sad situation for this very poor man who understands that he is not a smart person that he is very much average in every sense of the word yet he wants to be more and if he really wanted to be more he would put in the effort you know just because you went to an Ivy League college doesn't make you a genius it doesn't even make you intelligent I mean how we saw that with george w bush we have seen plenty of examples throughout all of history of people who went to Ivy League colleges some of them turned out to be serial killers some of them turned out to be rapists some of them turned out to be astrophysicists it doesn't matter where you go to school you can still be an idiot or a psychopath or a genius either way so stop trying to convince the world that you're an intelligent person by just saying you're an intelligent person you want us to think you're smart clean up your Twitter feed stop attacking people on Twitter who disagree with you and most importantly stop acting like such a dumbass at every possible opportunity thanks for watching and if you like what you see here on Ring of Fire we encourage you to subscribe to our Channel you can see the little subscribe button down there but if you're watching it on another device where you can't see it go to youtube.com slash the Ring of Fire hit subscribe be notified every time we get a new video
