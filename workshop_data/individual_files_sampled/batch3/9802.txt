MATTER AND THE PRESIDENT IS IN A POSITION TO SAVE THEM. MARTHA. Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE NOW, JASON HILL PROFESSOR OF MRFS HERE NOW, JASON HILL PROFESSOR OF MRFS DEPAUL UNIVERSITY. I KNOW THIS ISSUE IS NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART. YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT TO SEND THE FEDS. HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK? I THINK THE PRESIDENT COULD SEND IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. I THINK THE NAVY OR THE MARINES COULD BE SENT IN. I THINK IN 1957 PRESIDENT SIZE I THINK IN 1957 PRESIDENT SIZ SIZE -IZE EISENHOWER PROTECTED SCHOOL IMMIGRATION AND PRESIDENT BUSH DID IT TO PROTECT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ON THE HEELS OF THE RODNEY KING RIOT AND GEORGE BUSH DID IT TO SEND TROOPS TO THE MEXICAN BORDER. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS SEVERAL OPTIONS AT HIS DISPOSAL HE WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN CHICAGO. Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTIONS GOING ON THERE AND THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TESTING AGAINST THE CURRENT MAYOR. IS HE PART OF THE PROBLEM OR THE SOLUTION? I THINK HE'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. I THINK WE'RE UNDER THE MAYORAL GOVERNANCE OF AN IMPOTENT MAYOR WHO IS COMPLACENT AND THAT IS SYSTEMATIC OF WHAT IS GOING ON. I THINK THAT WE HAVE POLICE WHO ARE UNABLE WHO CAN SYSTEMATICALLY FIGHT THIS KIND OF GANG WARFARE. WHERE GANGS ARE RULING TURFS, IT IS UNCIVILIZED AND UNSPEAKABLE THAT THE NOT JUST IN CHICAGO AND BALTIMORE Martha: PROFESSOR, I'M ALMOST OUT OF TIME BUT I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE NFL ISSUE AND KNEELING AND POLICE BRUTALITY CONCERNS, ARE YOU TRYING TO WAKE UP PEOPLE TO WHAT PERHAPS IS A MORE PRESSING ISSUE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY? IT'S THE ABSENCE OF LAW AND ORDER RUNNING AMOK A THUGGISH THEORY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAS TO TAKE FORM AND AMERICANS HAVE TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE A RULE OF LAW HAS TO BE FOREMOST IN THE DEFENSE OF OUR GREAT REPUBLIC. THIS IS THE GREATEST NATION ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND I'M A GREAT PATRIOT AND WE NEED TO HAVE EYE CONVERSATION THE FAR LEFT IS NOT WILLING TO HAVE AND I THINK THE RULE OF LAW AND LAW AND ORDER HAVE GOT TO TAKE PRECEDENCE. Martha: PROFESSOR, I COMMEND
