very first days at school<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the here</font>

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,308
with a special at university is reality

constructed societies constructed and

then whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you grew that you have</font>

while these questions we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be</font>

28
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,370
concern yourself with and then you

truth and how truth works so did

35
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,270
anything at something that's necessarily

36
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,039
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> or it can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> avoided what's really</font>

37
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting in the context of everything</font>

38
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,170
that's happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me over the past</font>

39
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,900
eight months or so is that I spent the

40
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,970
past eight months trying to accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

41
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,010
reality something that to me seemed very

42
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,450
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like fiction and that's something</font>

43
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,909
that had been almost premeditated for me

44
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,439
by fiction by stories of you know

45
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">children losing their parents by films</font>

46
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,439
are the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to a certain</font>

47
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,180
extent it also seemed false because I

48
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,470
had captured all these moments because

49
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,970
I've recorded them because I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

50
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,470
blogger because I can go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

51
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,880
at them and watch them as there's a lot

52
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,930
of television show that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just</font>

53
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,490
casually watch them know that you know

54
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,020
everyone's fictional in it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

55
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,729
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I got the chance to go on to</font>

56
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,619
the TARDIS set now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't live in a</font>

57
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,240
completely fantastical world where I

58
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the doctor is actually going to</font>

59
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,939
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and save me or I think that that's</font>

60
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,530
necessarily what should happen all I

61
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,030
know is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing that I confits</font>

62
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,500
myself was completely fictional

63
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,090
completely an illusion all I know is

64
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point in my brain that had</font>

65
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,420
negated the possibility that any of it

66
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,100
was real for me I walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the TARDIS</font>

67
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,549
and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely beautiful and it</font>

68
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,229
was absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical people had</font>

69
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,430
broken bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and of course it</font>

70
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,899
doesn't make the TARDIS console sound

71
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,700
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still so many physical</font>

72
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,990
sounds around the TARDIS

73
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,970
I'm adduct you can pick up the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

74
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,470
make a phone call<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can touch the</font>

75
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,850
floor under the console and realize okay

76
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,650
what's not exactly stirring it's my

77
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,240
thick foam or something like that but

78
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,170
it's still something physical something

79
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,730
we can touch and this will be still

80
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,080
really exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the physicality of</font>

81
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
that and that filmmaking in television

82
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,320
world where we with suspicious of

83
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,850
everything we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach everything</font>

84
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,020
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily critical standpoint yeah</font>

85
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,430
that was a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonderful experience</font>

86
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,260
not just as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doctor who found also as</font>

87
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,730
someone who's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> grappling with these</font>

88
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">ideas of reality and fiction like</font>

89
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,390
obsessively and then yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was in</font>

93
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,390
so spread which is why I always such a

video oh I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my channels to</font>

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,750
once again to speak to all sorts of

amazing people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> f words or Quarren</font>

100

films a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> princess but again i was</font>

102
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,830
in proximity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real and</font>

103
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,510
physical that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been told isn't real</font>

104
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,430
in his just fiction if you'll excuse me

105
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,720
another segue into university

106
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,310
terminology<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this</font>

107
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,650
binary reality and fiction it makes what

108
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,090
we're talking about impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

109
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,769
neither of those discrete categories

110
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:27,510
exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's something sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

111
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,760
wonderful magical almost when you

112
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,739
realize how much those two terms are in

113

flux and their present physically in

many levels their affection and it's

116
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,040
moments like that little breaks in my

117
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,330
day that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible for me to</font>

to me that they were setting<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for</font>

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,460
which they recently reissued with

156
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,110
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> new cover so I got the nice</font>

157
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,539
original cover with the Chicago skyline

158
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:48,860
the other book I'm reading right now

159
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,289
which 138 pages into is across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

160
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,240
universe by Beth Revis so far i'm not

161
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,830
particularly convinced mainly because i

162
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,110
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge issue and it's just one tiny</font>

163
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,669
thing that can just ruin a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

164
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,530
when people set books in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

165
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,090
an alternate universes and they take

166
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,190
those expressions of oh my god and for

167
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,229
God's sake they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another word and</font>

168
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,000
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case was swearing as well</font>

169
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,560
so in across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the university's for</font>

170
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,690
example frexing just comes across as

171
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,759
very unnatural and unnecessary and it

172
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,500
sort of takes you out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality of</font>

173
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,449
the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find but like needs to</font>

174
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">suffer from completely opposing problems</font>

175
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
I found the names were just a bit weird

176
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
and unconvincing it again took<font color="#E5E5E5"> you out</font>

177
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,740
the familiarity of it wasn't there

178
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,150
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> about noumic catalyst you</font>

179
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,530
get used to quite quickly but the names

180
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,659
and heroes<font color="#CCCCCC"> but like a really pressure</font>

181
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,430
here on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand I felt like there</font>

182
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,110
are parts in which the writer tried too

183
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,759
hard to create this fantastical world

184
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,860
then also like she's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuck in</font>

185
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the present in our present in the modern</font>

186
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,090
day and so jarring and i'll keep reading

188
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,610
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been lovely to</font>

189
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,169

all this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> death despair</font>

191

destruction devastation decimation etc
