00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
I've taken a break from work for a few

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,649
minutes because this is a really

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:09,990
difficult and weird day to be a gay man

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">wherever you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world I think</font>

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">since the massacre that happened in the</font>

6

post club in Orlando a gay bar where a

guy took hostages and killed dozens of

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
people injured dozens of people I

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,059
tweeted about this this is a whole whole

<font color="#CCCCCC">war reminder really hammering reminder</font>

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed a justification to still have</font>

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,010
pride parades where equality has seemed

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,050
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been achieved across most of the</font>

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,750
West in terms of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship rights</font>

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,190
and our rights in the workplace and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">horrible reminder that um people will</font>

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,770
justify violence against us just because

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way the people that we end up</font>

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,640
falling in love with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was particularly</font>

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,830
harrowing for me because as somebody who

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,310
travels quite a lot I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,430
almost always go to the local gay bar of

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,070
wherever I'm traveling I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been to</font>

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,490
Orlando I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to the pulse club</font>

28
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,729
but I could have really easily been one

29
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,390
of the people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that venue that was</font>

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,020
shot injured or killed and friends of

mine could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have really easily been</font>

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,460
amongst the many that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up losing</font>

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,710
their lives over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weekend and</font>

34
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,630
it is somewhat selfish to be emotional

35
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,479
about that particular fact that oh I

36
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,550
could have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> affected by this um but</font>

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,860
it does bring it home what was

38
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,640
particularly harrowing was a account

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,209
that I heard of officers that working on

40
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the scene at the moment in the club</font>

41
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,030
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacks are having to ignore</font>

42
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,489
the ringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phones of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font>

43
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,300
who were killed there because people

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,220
their loved ones were trying to reach

45
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,500
them trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,480
now dead and fuck that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that was</font>

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,610
that's that's a horrible horrible image

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,440
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of criticism of quite</font>

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,200
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of media in the UK at least but</font>

50
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,430
also in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. of this being of it not</font>

51
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,690
being highlighted that this was a

52
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,360
homophobic attack these people died

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,239
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody thought that they're</font>

54
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,500
the people the fact that they fall in

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,120
love with people of the same sex or

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,940
people of people of different genders or

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,980
they identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain gender people</font>

58
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">found their lifestyle disgusting people</font>

59
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,870
found them as people disgusting that's

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,590
homophobia and for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

61
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,239
haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this number of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> die</font>

62
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,890
because of something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they happen to</font>

63
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,360
be there's been a lot of talk of the

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,820
fact that this is an Isis motivated to

65
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,680
sac Isis have claimed responsibility for

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,590
it there doesn't seem to be a huge

67
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,790
amount of evidence this apart from

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,430
anecdotal stuff the mods more Isis tend

69
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,910
to claim responsibility for attacks

70
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,280
wherever they happen just because it's

71
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,709
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun for them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to install fear in</font>

72
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,100
people I know one thing I'm going to

73
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,920
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not let terrorism</font>

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,590
no matter who it's affected out I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

75
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,150
going to let toes and affect the choices

76
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,940
that I make<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to continue to</font>

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,790
frequent homosexual establishments I'm

78
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,760
container continue with my plans<font color="#CCCCCC"> um to</font>

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,980
attend pride events because it is LGBT

80
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,810
pride month and I would encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

81
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,230
as well to always be safe but not let

82
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,220
your decisions be marred by levels of

83
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,639
fear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want you to feel</font>

84
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,320
because then they win there's two other

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,940
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want to address um firstly</font>

86
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,590
something that is obvious for the

87
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">majority of us around the world with</font>

88
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,870
stricter<font color="#E5E5E5"> gun control laws there wouldn't</font>

89
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">be this many massacres that happen</font>

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,750
across the u.s. sort your shit out thank

91
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,280
you and finally something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

92
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,010
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important is the aspect of</font>

93
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,430
Islam in these attacks I talked about

94
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">this a lot with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um Jimmy on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> podcast</font>

95
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,140
that I do where we talk about social

96
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues and current events and he finds</font>

97
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,410
it baffling that I are I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not more</font>

98
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,760
offended by homophobia within Islam

99
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,500
because especially people within the way

100
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,120
especially a month like ethnic groups

101
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,479
people who identify as Muslim are more

102
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,890
likely to disagree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving same-sex</font>

103
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,620
couples rights are more likely to agree

104
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,800
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of gay people not being</font>

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,390
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treated the same as everybody</font>

106
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,600
else we've also seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> our over the past</font>

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,419
like 24 hours the right-wing pundit from

108
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,260
Breitbart<font color="#CCCCCC"> Milo yo napolis who is mildly</font>

109
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,910
entertaining but also has horrific

110
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,270
horrific views say that this isn't

111
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,760
homophobia this isn't Islam exam

112
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,979
extremism this is Islam violent people

113
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:09,850
and homophobic people will choose

114
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:16,469
whatever excuse they'd have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

115
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:19,719
partake in violent act a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of</font>

116
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,189
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we also saw over the weekend</font>

117
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,509
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the large number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Russian and</font>

118
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:24,279
England fans in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> European</font>

119
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">Championships who had special forces</font>

120
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,479
police have to break up riots at the

121
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">football match that happened there those</font>

122
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,129
people don't represent English football

123
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,919
fans Russian football fans those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

124
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,939
represent people who have looked for a

125
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,009
place to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> violent and looked for a</font>

126
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,520
place to pick a fight I don't see

127
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,699
anybody suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the England fans</font>

128
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,520
that were in France over the weekend

129
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,289
were representative of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of</font>

130
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:57,610
people that are backing the England team

131
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,789
it does seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Muslims</font>

132
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,789
justify homophobia through their faith

133
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,050
what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really important for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

134
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,529
to remember is that being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Muslim does</font>

135
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:13,349
not mean that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are homophobic and</font>

136
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,479
being accepting of gay people does not

137
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,779
affect somebody's ability to be a Muslim

138
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,089
homophobic people are homophobic people

139
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,860
no matter what ethnic background they

140
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,319
come from and they will use anything in

141
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,969
their arsenal be it Christianity or

142
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,819
class or personal experience or Islam

143
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,949
they will use any excuse that they have

144
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,979
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to justify their actions and</font>

145
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,310
sometimes violent<font color="#E5E5E5"> actions against gay</font>

146
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,339
people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think when there's a lot</font>

147
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,899
of heat and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of emotions</font>

148
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,499
surrounding this particular massacre

149
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,810
that happened in Orlando it's important

150
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,089
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that Islam isn't the</font>

151
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:58,120
problem here homophobia<font color="#E5E5E5"> and extremism</font>

152
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,229
are and as long as we keep our<font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font>

153
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,479
screwed on in those two cents we can

154
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,959
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> win</font>

155
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,200
I think that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say about</font>

156
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">this what people who are extreme and</font>

157
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,370
what people who are hateful one is for

158
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,840
there to be panic and for there to be

159
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,020
