earlier this week lawmakers specifically Republican lawmakers in this great state of Georgia threatened Delta over its decision to sever certain ties with the NRA now Delta wanted to take a stand against the NRA and stop offering discount prices for NRA members who wish to fly with that airline now as a direct response to that Republican lawmakers threatened to take certain tax benefits away from Delta if they pursue this severing of ties with the NRA now Delta remained undeterred and they decided to go ahead with their original plan and the retaliation has already begun so here is the update to what lawmakers in Georgia have done by the way Delta is one of the largest employers in the state of Georgia now the State House and Senate within hours of each other passed a sweeping tax bill that Republicans had amended they amended it to strip out a sales tax exemption on jet fuel elana base Delta would have been the prime beneficiary of this tax break which would have been worth an estimated 38 million dollars now Before we jump in with commentary look you know how I feel about you know these sweet little perks for corporations to begin with however in the context of this story lawmakers retaliating against anyone including a corporation which is not a person but still a corporation for its political stance or political speech I would argue might have some constitutional issues I don't know you jump in Jane tell me what you think yeah look if Democrats in a blue state attacked a corporation for being too conservative I mean you know what Republicans are they hate the free market they're socialists they're communists they're Marxists they're the worse and I can't believe they're using taxpayer you know money or whether it's subsidies are taking away subsidies to threaten people for their political position and etc they do it no concern at all I mean so this is in the house on the house side in in Georgia vote was a hundred and thirty five to twenty four so not close not remotely close every Republican voted for it and the Senate side thirty four to fifteen not remotely close so they're like oh yeah punish people for punish corporations for not having the politically correct I principles and ideas and positions great let's do it that is literal political practice it's political correctness you're right this is it goes against what they preach about the free market I mean you're I mean you're going after a corporation and and and picking winners and losers based on your own political beliefs and look let's put it in the context of a more liberal state right so let's do a little throwback back in I believe it was 2012 chick-fil-a was in the middle of controversy because the head of chick-fil-a during an interview talked about how he was against same-sex marriage and can you imagine if the state of California decided we don't like that so we're gonna increase sales taxes specifically for chick-fil-a or we're going to get rid of a specific tax break that we gave the fast-food industry but it'll only apply to chick-fil-a because we don't like what they had to say about gay marriage first of all I would be 100% against that even though I was not in favor of what the head of chick-fil-a said you can't elected officials cannot go after people or companies because they disagree with their political views that's insane so guys if you're a Republican and you believe in money and politics you're like ben shapiro and you think the corruptions awesome let's just more money by billionaires and corporations are terrific because corporations are people my friend okay alright wait are they people are they not people because if you discriminate against an actual person because their political opinion and the government punishes them that is clearly one hundred-percent unconstitutional you can't make the argument that it's not unconstitutional that's plain as day okay so if the companies are people as you claim then you should be outraged oh my god they did something unconstitutional to the person called Delta right you you don't believe their people the only reason you say that is because you'd like to take their money and give it to corrupt politicians that's right if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm slash joy
