so Seth Rogen's apparently communicating in private with Jack Dorsey who is the CEO of Twitter and he's specifically calling out Dorsey for you know the fact that white supremacists are getting the blue check the verification on Twitter he thinks that that's crazy and so he says I've been dealing with Jack about his bizarre need to verify white supremacist on his platform for the last eight months or so and after all the exchanges I've reached the conclusion that the dude simply does not seem to give up yes and so I think that actually a lot of people are reaching that conclusion and and there's two possibilities one is that Twitter is the extreme version of well both sides do it he said she said on the other hand right on the one hand legitimate people on the other hand Nazis and hey you know you say tomato I say tomahto right you say let's have a democracy they say kill the Jews anyways we're just having a conversation and that's a possibility and I don't think it's a good positive I don't think that's a good thing but that's actually the more positive of the two possibilities the other possibility is the guys who run Twitter are really really right-wing and so like people always assume because of right-wing propaganda that anything associated with the media is liberal that's not remotely true most of the media's multi-billion dollar corporations in the case of I know anybody I don't know jack literally in this case and I don't know anything about Jack Dorsey in particular and I don't know about the executives at Twitter at all right I don't know their political inclinations are but we know the results and maybe if they keep promoting and verifying white supremacists maybe they don't disagree with them I mean so I'm not trying to be provocative and I'm not like trying to throw Twitter under a bus but I mean it's a Seth Rogen's asking is a super legit question so where do you draw the line like so and and by the way and now do in Twitter's here it's really hard because a lot of our politicians are now white supremacists yes Steve King Steve King right and we're not throwing that word around willy-nilly or flippantly I'm not saying like all the Republican congressman or senator or senators are white supremacists I know that some could make that argument etc but no we're talking about specifically Steve King has said that he's in favor of white culture and he's saying that if the immigrants come in were doomed and and that they're gonna rape or rape all the women and he says he tweeted that on Twitter today right so he's a United States congressman what he gonna do ban him on the other hand the president calls immigrants criminals and rapists and animals and say they're gonna infest the country these are deeply racist tropes and stereotypes that have been done to promote you know and you feel you know whatever word you're comfortable with racism bigotry white supremacy white nationalism I don't know look like people get triggered by those words I'm not trying to trigger you I'm just saying that it's obvious that the Trump and Steve King are doing things that that people who've you know try to scare you about blacks in this country or immigrants in this country have done for a long long time for hundreds of years now they're using the same exact stereotypes so and on the other hand there's people that are even worse on Twitter who are monsters who are all right guys our alt light or whatever they call themselves today that go around bragging about how they smear people and pretend that they are pedophiles that their opponents political opponents are pedophiles they no they're not and they think that it's they literally defame people like and and try to destroy their lives based on complete and utter lies look and understand that what Rogen is arguing here Seth Rogen's arguing is not let's ban them from Twitter he's saying why are you giving like neo-nazis and white nationalists white supremacist why are you giving them that verification that checkmark because that adds credibility and legitimacy or at least it's a person it's a perception that people have if they see that check mark they think oh this is a real person a serious person that I should consider listening to and he's right it really does it right or wrong he gives it an air of legitimacy yeah right so look let's show you a thing that Ron Paul retweeted just yesterday so these are all examples from the last two days so this is graphic 84 so he talked about cultural Marxism which is a deeply anti-semitic term and I explained the origins of that yesterday on The Young Turks and so and in the cartoon which he tweeted there is not only horrible stereotypes of Africans Americans Latinos Chinese people Asians but look at that Jewish caricature in the beginning right and by the way the is if you didn't see that segment that I did they say that the cultural Marxists were started with a group of Jews that escaped the Holocaust and came to America and in their insane view of the world spread Marxism throughout the the country and took it over for the corporate elite and are poisoning our culture right so now Seth Rogen other than being a decent human being also happens to be Jewish American now if you're Jewish America and you got these guys all the way up to Iran posted always staffer did that so is it honest mistake well that's yeah I know first of all that's like he's made that argument for decades now back in those letters yes Oh stammers stammers stammers why do you keep surrounding yourself with deeply racist and bigoted staffers right like Oh golly gee did I fire this ever again and did he make that public Oh golly gee there I go again dr. Ron Paul right but but Ron Paul and Steve King are the tip of the iceberg and the iceberg is all right and with the people calling themselves the alt light and then it's nothing light about them right and so if you're Seth Rogen and you got this stuff this poison in on Twitter I think it couldn't be more legitimate to ask are you gonna do anything about that because we're now living in a world where and people who are aspired to be Nazis have a blue check next to their name credible legitimate wonderful a hey we're having a conversation right you you know it's it's an insanity that is that's hard to solve I mean look on the one hand I think the blue check thing for some of these monsters that are alright is easy to solve in south Rogen's right about that on the other hand they do have power in this country and yes we are actually having a legitimate debate with people who use words like culture phrases like cultural Marxist which is as anti-semitic as it gets let alone what they say about black people and Latinos and Muslims I mean and that's the problem and that's that's what Seth Rogen and other decent people are trying to avoid because if the Nazis didn't say on day one we're gonna kill all the Jews they didn't they denied it almost to the end they would tell people oh no we're taking him out of the country and then they'd sent him to the gas chambers and that was near the end in the beginning it was well they're the ones that are causing all your problems exactly what the right-wing is saying now about certain groups of people right and and they're the ones that have all the power they are the ones who rigged this system and you got to watch out for them I'm protecting you I'm protecting you from the evil Jews who are ruining everything and running and they're ruining our culture a good Germanic culture they're ruining it here we are again here we are again I know it's crazy so it's super scary times and for people you know organizations like Twitter to go yeah I hear you on the other hand you say tomato and I say tomato two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
