welcome back a change for the Supreme Court on the horizon with that comes the fear that dozens of influential decisions may be at risk of being overturned including protections from workplace discrimination a new report that caught my eye I'm talking about it for a week from the New York Times lays out the special brand of prejudice that pregnant women face through careful examination of court and public records as well as dozens of interviews the New York Times reporters found a clear pattern of discrimination emerged many of the country's largest companies systematically sideline pregnant women as a direct result of this reporting I love this Governor Cuomo and a New York State Attorney launched a campaign to inform women of the rights and prevent issues of discrimination and the state has launched investigations into the conduct of Walmart Merck Novartis and Glencore we should note Walmart Merck and Glencore have denied engaging in pregnancy discrimination Novartis previously said in a statement that after settling a class-action lawsuit in 2010 for a hundred and seventy-five million bucks it's taken additional steps to promote gender equality joining me now the fantastic reporters on this eye-opening story Jessica's silver Greenberg and Natalie kicked I can't say kit Rho F okay ladies you highlighted that this in the Supreme Court case young versus UPS it's an important one and I want you to help us understand what did this case mean for women in the workplace so the Supreme Court in 2015 ruled in favor of Peggy Young who was an early morning driver who had asked for light duty UPS denied the light duty at the time UPS was granting light duty to a whole host of other workers including men who had lost their driver's license because they were driving drunk so Peggy young takes her case all the way to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court rules that she has standing in that case and essentially what they're saying there is that because UPS was accommodating so many other workers it was probably violating the Pregnancy Discrimination Act which protects pregnant women from discrimination by not giving her light duty singling her out okay in your article talk about the impression managers have a pregnant women they're less committed less dependable less authoritative more irrational what if anything can women do to combat this perception or as taking legal action their only option I mean that's one of the frustrating things that we found I think that consistently women said so take someone like Aaron Murphy Aaron Murphy works at Glencore one of the largest commodities trading companies a giant company right she does everything in the lead-up to her pregnancy and after she gives birth to her first child to insulate herself from this perception that she's going to be flighty distracted predominantly focused on her kid and she arranges childcare starting at like 7:30 or 6:30 in the morning so that she's never late to a meeting none of that works she still she says passed over for promotion she still belittled on the trading floor she's still basically treated suddenly like a second-class citizen then what do we do about this if it's also this soft or assumed discrimination I spent 14 years of my life on a trading floor before I got into TV that soft discrimination we've all experienced for years that assuming you know you just want to go home to your kids so you don't want to go on this business trip how do we do something without taking legal action it's a cultural issue yeah I mean I think what we saw was that at every rung of the economic ladder so you know we're talking about women at Walmart who also face this kind of discrimination and a company can have a gold standard policy on the books but the way that Americans interact in the workplace is they're talking to managers who may not know the law they may not have heard about this policy so until the kind of high-level concerns about this kind of treatment trickle down into the very kind of basic interactions that managers have with workers and until workers really know that what's happening to them is illegal right because some of the stuff that a lot of these women face is really subtle and it's hard to put your finger but that's it you can't touch it but you can feel it and that takes us to this so-called mother penalty yeah where women face discrimination not just for being pregnant but after the fact we're already having children when men they work with could use it to their advantage if you work in a very competitive environment there's that edge that they could take well I mean she can't possibly be the killer she once was she has a baby exactly and also you know the the thing that is pretty galling I think that the statistics bear out right is exactly what you're saying so men get a pay bump after they become fathers because now they have more people to support in their home because they're the father figure breadwinners they're more reliable they've abandoned their bachelor lifestyle in favor of something more stable whereas women are considered they're in this catch-22 they're judged for if they remain at work and design their entire lives around the fucker committed to work how could you be such a terrible mother that you'd be committed to something else okay well many people go back to work because we've had very minimum wage increases exactly president Trump's make America great again in the 1950s a father could go to work and a mother could stay at home and they have two kids and they put food on the table and have a car today both parents need to go to work give an increased number of single moms it's not an option so people are working because they need to support themselves so what's the takeaway I mean listen I love that Andrew Cuomo is like let's have a campaign but like sweet you got a billboard and a pamphlet what can actually be done when you reach out to these companies what were they like to interface with mmm they don't want your call no they didn't know no they did not um they were one of the things that I found interesting is that the company some of them would point out this couldn't possibly be discriminatory Stephanie because guess what one man out those know well actually they said a woman the manager was a woman and she's a mother and she's also a grandmother and we are responsible as well right anyone can discriminate they don't have to it doesn't have to be a man in order to discriminate and so they point to the policies that Natalie pointed out right the ones these gold standard policies and from there there's little other engagement and I think there's something to this that's sort of similar to the me to movement in the sense that before me too there were all of these that were happening but we kind of saw as just the price of doing business that's such a great point that we just sort of accepted like well I mean that's like right in the real world I mean pregnant women it's it's expensive to accommodate them you know they're gonna be away from their work I think that there is a kind of cultural sense at this point and who knows if it will change down the line that this is just you know you I mean the reality is that it's expensive to it to deal with these women who get pregnant and you know this is what we should expect to happen and you know what happened with me too is that all of a sudden the acceptable became unacceptable I don't know how that change happens right well in women have to be I think part of our work and part of speaking to these women was we tried to make them feel less ashamed because they also feel a sense of culpability here well I chose to have a baby I wanna you know I wanted to leave come on now thank you so much for this reporting in corporate America here's a fun fact for you mama bears are more ferocious than ever because they have babies to protect hey they're
