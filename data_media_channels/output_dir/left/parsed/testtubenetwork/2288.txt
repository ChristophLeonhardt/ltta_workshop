Baghdad, Iraq
Nisour Square
Employees of a U.S. militarized security company,
Blackwater, open fire on a busy intersection
killing 17 and wounding 20.
The contractors claim that their convoy was
attacked, but Iraqi officials and eyewitnesses
call the massacre unprovoked.
The Iraqi government temporarily revokes Blackwaterâ€™s
license and calls on 
the US to end their contract.
In April 2015, after multiple setbacks, four
of five indicted contractors are found guilty.
One receives a life sentence, the others get
30 years in prison.
Contractors like Blackwater have long been
criticized for their military tactics and
use of excessive force.
