following Amuro says release of recordings showing that there were some issues in the white house issues that make the Trump administration's look particularly bad Donald Trump decided to fight back via Twitter and so his recent tweet in regard to Omarosa has caught a little bit of heat let me tell you what he said when you give a crazed crying lowlife a break you give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn't work out good work by general Kelly for firing that dog so that last part has upset people for obvious reasons referring to a black woman as a dog is problematic to say the least and so you know look I don't know what else to say about it I mean what but what do you expect it what Trump says is one thing but his actions speak way louder than words hey you guys might be surprised that I'm a little mixed on this and I'll tell you why so there are some racial slurs that are obvious and then the right wing will claim no what we called that black person an ape I don't know why you're taking so president no we know what you're talking about it's the oldest racial stereotype it's what people of you said for hundreds of years to attack African Americans okay and so there's a list of us then there are others that are a being nothing you can compare someone to an animal it means nothing at all I just called Omarosa snake earlier in the show and I got no problem oh say that a thousand times because she is and so is Donald Trump okay and so was Michael Cohen yes almost everybody that works in the Trump administration if you called her a parrot you'd be like okay I don't know what that means right so it depends it depends so does Donald Trump call people dogs well kind of he's called women dogs in the past okay so there's that I don't know if it makes it any better or makes it worse and then he said Mitt Romney choked like a dog he said David Gregory was fired like a dog and he said Ted Cruz lies like a dog well well see and that's why I mixed on it because now Ted Cruz whimpers like a dog to Donald Trump yes does and I and I know you shouldn't use that derogatory because animus are innocent but this one to me is a little bit less clear given the overwhelming racial history of Donald Trump and the way he has attacked african-americans over and over and over again and specifically so to me when he called her not smart that was actually worse now why I mean it doesn't have to be a racial story call anybody not smart that doesn't mean that it's racial at all it seems to use that insult specifically for black people all the time and and almost exclusively for them so he's got a billion insults and that's why again dog I'm like yeah but this guy's a you know unhinged cause like eighteen different things dogs right but Don Lemon these are the people he called low IQ Don Lemon Maxine Waters LeBron James and Omarosa hmm what connects those four and then of course always note the irony that this is the lowest IQ person in public life Donald Trump call the other people low IQ but why it's in the back of his head all these racial stereotypes Puerto Ricans are they didn't help themselves during the hurricane because they're lazy criminals and rapists that's right and and and the Jews are like to renegotiate these are all things he said because that's the kind of stereotypes to be polite that he has in his head so I don't know what he meant by dog but I do know what who he is look all I know is again actions speak louder than words so if you're trying to judge him solely based on what he says that's one thing but I would argue that it's more valuable to judge someone based on the actions they take the fact that he took out a full-page ad after the Central Park five were proven innocent and and in that ad he said that they should be executed anyway that says something yeah let me just be clear he wanted them executed in the beginning before they were tried before he had any idea if they were guilty and then later when they were proven innocent he said they should stay in jail anyway and he said yeah they probably did something they found the actual guy who did the rape and he wasn't a minority and he confessed and they had his DNA it's that guy they wrongly imprisoned these poor kids for all those years but he's they're black so he comes out he's like yeah they probably did something they were kids he's such a monster so it's an interesting debate about the word dog but we already know who this guy is finally I want to go to Sarah Huckabee Sanders press conference today she was asked specifically whether or not she could guarantee that Trump said any racial slur specifically the n-word here was her response to it I can't guarantee anything but I can tell you that the president addressed this question directly I can tell you that I've never heard it I can also tell you that if myself or the people that are in this building serving in this country every single day doing our very best to help people all across this country and make it better if at any point we felt that the president was who some of his critics claimed him to be we certainly wouldn't be here so she can't guarantee it by the guy who by the way the guy who might have tapes is Mark Burnett who produced The Apprentice that's a theory I don't know if it's true and Mark Burnett is evangelical Republican so if he has the tapes he didn't release him during the election he hasn't released of now I mean if there's a conspiracy to make sure Donald Trump didn't win the world's worst conspiracy because nobody ever released bad stuff about him no to be fair Access Hollywood tape they did really sad but they unleashed on Hillary Clinton the FBI and everyone else so I if that tape exists and that answer from Sarah P Sanders makes me believe that it definitely does it's apparently people who are friendly to him who or keeping it from the public chair what do you think dog racial or not racial doesn't think so you said he's calling other ones dogs instead he lied like a dog I forget examples he did the sigh he's the fight was like a dog was yes like a dog yeah okay so those were now I'm gonna have maybe some small differences with this but those were they did the things like a dog that was a dog he said about her just I'm just going off of the mindset of this guy also if you have a track record that this guy has and if you actually cared about your track record in the fact that you'd call the races for good reason you think about the things that you say that's a great point your your background is that so you don't care enough to think you know people might think that this kind of comes off but he's just thinking I'm gonna hit her and head on back because I'm a counter-puncher so if your track record is that that's a problem already so we're know who you are so when you say it we can read into that my kids kindergarten teacher she has to have little names for her class she's right it's called my my you know one called him the coast lady's my Cubs she had to call monkey mothers losing my little monkeys they go crazy and we're like baby don't use it but at least you don't have a track record for doing that yeah think about what you're saying because there's some kids in the class - maybe that's it's a problem and you're thinking all that just crazy kids like to climb on walls that's your thought process but you're missing something but at least you'll have a track record for being a racist and we can go why are you doing that you're the track record you just think about it yeah you should especially the president United States that's such a great point because even if you think he did not have bad intent who is so low IQ than in the tweet when you have been accused of racism a million times you call an african-american person you're opposed to both not smart in an earlier tweet doing it for the fourth time in a short period of time all against African Americans and then you call her a dog a lowlife and a dog man that's not savvy at all I'm just so I like you know how you're tired about the debates regarding the Russia and Vesey I'm tired of having debates about whether or not he's racist he said that the Charlottesville white nationalists some of them are good people some of them are good people they were chanting blood and soil blood and soil the Jews will not replace us who says some of them are good people two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do
