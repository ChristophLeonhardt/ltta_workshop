welcome to our last word Memorial Day special one year ago this month President Trump provoked the appointment of a special prosecutor after the president fired the FBI director who was investigating Russian influence in the presidential campaign then the president admitted on national television that he fired the FBI director because of the Russia investigation regardless of recommendation I was going to fire call me knowing there was no good time to do it and in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself I said you know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story and not long after that there was a massive shake-up in the Trump White House with Steve ban and Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus all eventually leaving former Marine General John Kelly replaced Reince Priebus as the White House chief of staff many in the political media seemed to believe that John Kelly would put an end to the chaos in the Trump White House because John Kelly would be the so-called adult in the room one believer in John Kelly mythology as the savior of the Trump White House is John Kelly himself who actually recently said this on NPR in retrospect I wish I had been here from day one in terms of staffing or serving the president that first six months was pretty chaotic there were people hired that maybe shouldn't have been hired no it's not that things were a disaster that first six months but I believe they could have been better okay so John Kelly now says that when Reince Priebus was White House chief of staff that first six months was pretty chaotic those are his words it turns out that the only thing in presidential history more chaotic than the first six months of the Trump presidency is the John Kelly period as chief of staff here's a sample of what's happened in John Kelly's White House Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the president a moron in a private meeting and of course those private words were leaked and became public Donald Trump campaigned for an alleged child molester in the US Senate race in Alabama in a press conference Donald Trump called Nazis and white supremacists good people with John Kelly in the room watching from the sidelines John Kelly did nothing to stop the president from nominating his personal physician Ronnie Jackson to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs a nomination that was obviously doomed from the start John Kelly made the robb Porter scandal much much worse by protecting Rob Porter four days after Porter's former wives accused him of abuse and of course who could ever forget John Kelly getting caught in an angry lie about President Obama and a black congresswoman Frederica Wilson lies for which John Kelly has never apologized congresswoman stood up and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building now she took care of her constituents because she got the money and she just called up President Obama and on that phone call he gave the money the twenty million dollars to build a building she sat down and we were stunned stunned that she done it even for someone that is that empty a barrel we were stunned joining our discussion now Joey Reed the host of am joy weekend mornings on MSNBC and Jonathan Capehart opinion writer for The Washington Post and an MSNBC contributor joy that that video is now just the indelible image of John Kelly every word he said was untrue and he has to this day never had the decency to apologize right and let's not forget that he you know went after congresswoman Frederica Wilson in the course of congresswoman Frederica Wilson defending the family of a fallen soldier 'la David Johnson and that was a personal friend of the family she was trying to advocate for her constituent and trying to find out how this young man had died and in the course of putting her down john kelly in a sense also dismissed that family who were being called Liars by the President of the United States by the way and John Kelly was Sonny you know valiantly you know died in Ward never defended the family you know and it's interesting that John Kelly says that things would have been so much better had he been there from the beginning well let's not forget he was there from the beginning now he was homeland security director during the Muslim travel ban which apparently he found out about belatedly but was totally fine with he was there running ice before his now protege is running eyes and terrifying immigrants all over the country at least Reince Priebus didn't do interviews in which he displayed a lack of knowledge of the civil war makes himself the story defended a beater you know in a way we might look back at the Reince Priebus there's kind of the golden years of the golden era of the trump administration well I haven't true Trump White House Chiefs of Staff it seems to me one is better than the other and I can't see what's better about John Kelly's run than Reince Priebus is wrong I know and we're talking about a very low bar here right and John Kelly couldn't get over it right so look Lawrence I was one of those members of the media who when General Kelly was made chief of staff who wrote a piece saying all right here comes the general he's gonna bring some order to the chaos in the West Wing however I thought that was perfectly reasonable optimism right this guy does know something one thought about organization and chain of command right also in that piece I said his firing of Anthony scarab Moochie will probably be the high point of his tenure I was hoping I'd be wrong I'm not wrong it was the high point of his tenure the montage that you showed is juggles the mind that a person who is supposed to be when it comes to the White House and the Oval Office the second most powerful person in the building and even he a former general cannot bring control to that complex and we all know the reason why no matter who the chief of staff is the president is the problem he has been the problem he is the problem he will be the problem so anyone who takes a job in that administration particularly in the West Wing better know that before they even know what strikes me about John Kelly is he is the same kind of problem that the president tries we just showed videotape yeah of John Kelly lying word-for-word right about a member of Congress we can't show you that videotape about anyone else who's ever worked in the White House there's no one else so we can show you here here's the day that the White House chief of staff under any president got up and lying ly insulted a member of Congress well and did it in the same way Donald Trump would I mean only that he is Donald Trump with you know bars on his chest or he has the same attitude toward immigrants in general he has the same attitude this sort of women are supposed to be sacred but not too me John Kelly when I'm dissing one who was a member of Congress never apologizing these weird attitudes about again the Civil War he isn't that much more sort of ideologically disciplined than Donald Trump and so he can train in those aspects of Donald Trump's nature because he shares Donald Trump's ideological predilections so what he's changing I don't know maybe Trump respects him a little bit more than he respects Reince Priebus let's face it he kind of respects almost everyone more than he respected Wright's business I don't know that that is that much of an improvement he did fire Omarosa but then she almost stormed the residence in the process of being fired by john kelly so i don't even if he did that well you know Michael Wolfe in his book said that they all have a name for Trump you know Rex Tillerson calls him a moron others call him an idiot and John Kelly is in the idiot camp according to leaks from the John Kelly White House the leaks that I'm supposed to that he was supposed to have prevented and so NBC News reported a weeks ago that John Kelly thinks of himself as the lone bulwark against catastrophe curbing the erratic urges of a president who has questionable grasp on policy issues and the functions of government and he has referred to Trump as an idiot multiple times to underscore his point and Jonathan the clock has to start ticking as soon as Donald Trump reads somewhere what you call him it's amazing that Rex Tillerson lasted as long as he did after the moron quote got out but John Kelly is now carrying around that idiot quote and knows it right and but he's still there he is still there and in in that quote that you just read I kept thinking of brownie remember held a job brownie heck of a job Kelly yes he's supposed to bring order to all of this and I just it makes you it makes me wonder if John Kelly were to leave because when I interviewed Michael Michael wolf on WNYC he told me then that and this was January that he wasn't sure how long Kelley was going to was going to last and that was before that came out so if Kelly goes who on earth is he going to get to to take over the job and we all know that he the president has said he's not maybe I don't need a chief of staff quite frankly he doesn't need a chief of staff because it's not gonna listen to that person anyway yeah we saw the Director of Communications hope Hicks go and not be replaced sorry this could end up as the White House without the White House chief of staff at some point need a chief of staff he's got his unsecure phone he could just call Tom Merrick and all his friends and call Sean handy apparently Sean Hannity's kind of his chief of staff so I mean this is a president who does not and the more you try to rein him in and discipline the more he dislikes you he gets mad he's like a toddler that doesn't want to have to sit down right he wants to kick and scream and jump on the couch and if you tell him to sit down then he gets mad I mean he he gets more angry with the people who try to discipline him so really the best bet to be his chief of staff was let him do what he wants in which case you're not necessarily and and let him do what he wants certainly seems to be the John Kelly motto as of now I don't know if it was on the first day but it seems to have become his motto for a long time and put that that presumes that John Kelly has some modicum of control I don't think he has any control so he's not letting the President or anything the president's got the president is just doing it and I go back to my little rule of thumb when it comes to this White House I do not think of the Trump White House or as a presidency mm-hmm I think of it as a crime family like the like in the Godfather he is the Godfather when you think of it that way then it makes sense that he wouldn't he wouldn't replace a communications director but probably doesn't listen to his chief of staff and probably won't replace the chief of staff every decision that is made has nothing to do with the United States the presidency the institution of the presidency it has everything to do with how does this make me look in terms of the rating how is this popular with my base is this good for me and so because of that are we is anyone surprised at this meeting with Kim jong-un might not happen I'm not we will find out joy and Jonathan thank you both
