and the Syria big time in the headlines again - real hotspots we'll start with this the northern city of Alfred that's come under heavy shelling from the Turkish army anchors ramped up its operation in that region to try to dislodge the Kurdish fighters which it says and seize our terrorists came after a pro Syrian government militia arrived in a foreign to join the fight against the Turkish military for his part Turkey's president air Doan saying the shelling forced that group of fighters to retreat ten kilometers but other conflicting reports suggest in fact the pro Syrian government forces have actually taken up positions now in Africa the current leasing here pictures of their arrival purported to be on Tuesday night I've seen a correspondent lurid gas dfx takes a closer look at this unfolding very complicated volatile situation this was a demonstration hundreds of pro-assad militia fighters with tanks armored brazenly riding into Afrin with smiles Cheers and cameras the Turks well see for yourself anchor his response was explosive loaded and delivered in artillery shells today towards evening it was determined by the HTS militia that about ten pickup trucks were coming towards Afrin they were then forced to turn back following the shelling this case has been closed for now everyone warned that this would happen no one may help the YPG he said as for the Kurds themselves she's promised to put them in a chokehold in mere days the preparation on the ground takes time in the coming days we will lay siege to the city of Afrin here you have two major anti-isis coalition partners terrorists and aggressor as they call each other turkey and the YPG a partner and all but name duking it out beating each other to bloody pop one might ask where is America the head of the us-led anti-isis coalition why are you still here why are these weapons still arriving America is in the process of creating a terrorist army on our border do not encroach on our borders do not provoke us we will run out of patience let's not forget how it all began with this statement a US declaration that it would build an army of kurds to patrol the turkish border that sent everyone into a fit rage and it was that statement that was used to justify this new war washington backtracked it's now laying low but the damage was done the coalition imploded and it's up to others to stop this remove it and we do not believe that the US will protect the Kurds the u.s. strategy depends on creating new chaos in the Middle East to pursue its interests in this region it is sad Washington set the fire that is now consuming its own anti-isis coalition and burning Afrin to the ground the u.s. rule has been reduced to diligently expressing its concern worried but not regret now that's something that middle east analyst joshua landis agrees with he says the Kurds have fallen victim to America's power play in that region the US has been supplying a lot of weaponry to the Kurds east of the Euphrates when the United States first entered into Syria it at Turkey and the United States came up to an agreement that everything west of the Euphrates was turkeys everything east of the Euphrates the United States men bitch is a sore point but that's still to be decided on but that's the way it's been in the United States has been giving a lot of weapons to the YPG now it's obviously telling the YPG do not attack turkey with his weapons because the moment you do that you will justify everything that air Dewan says is going to happen that you're connected with a KKK and so the United States is sitting on the Kurds and in essence is telling the YPG you have to sacrifice your brothers in Afreen to preserve us out east of the Euphrates meantime the situation and another Syrian hotspots developing to violence in the eastern guter area close to the Syrian capital Damascus is on the rise and it's provoked an outcry from the United Nations to the organization's calling for an end to hostilities after what's going on there following reports that government airstrikes on the rebel Enclave there we've killed at least a hundred in just the last recent days Eastern guter is one of the few remaining opposition strongholds the Syrian government says it strikes on the militants are in retaliation though for shelling attacks that have killed civilians in the capital the area may recall was among the de-escalation zones that were established by the warring parties last year will be across that story of course as Moore comes out from that area keep you up-to-date on the developments that over the coming hours and days
