8
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,287
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN

9
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:10,554
ROLLED INTO CRIMEA TODAY AND

10
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:12,790
HE DID IT IN THE DRIVER'S

11
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,193
SEAT OF A TRUCK.

12
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:17,795
BECAUSE PUTIN, HE WAS

13
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:18,863
SHOWING OFF A NEW BRIDGE

14
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:20,298
THAT LINKS SOUTHERN RUSSIAN

15
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:22,433
TO THE CRIMIAN PENINSULA.

16
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:22,767
REALLY?

17
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:25,670
AND YOU WONDER WHY HE

18
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,504
INVADED THERE IN THE FIRST

19
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:26,837
PLACE.

20
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,439
REMEMBER THE AREA HE DECIDED

21
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,574
TO TAKE AWAY FROM UKRAINE I

22
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:31,842
SHOULD SAY BACK FROM UKRAINE

23
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:33,077
BACK IN 2014.

24
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:34,078
THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION

25
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:35,046
OF A VICTORY LAP.

26
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,280
AT THE TIME THE WORLD SAID

27
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,515
THE REASON HE IS DOING IT IS

28
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:38,950
HE WANTS THIS BRIDGE.

29
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:00,000
HE NEEDS A WARM WATER PORT.
