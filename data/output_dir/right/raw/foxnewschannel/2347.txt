1
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:06,408
AND CANDANCE OWENS AND GREG

2
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:06,841
GUTFELD.

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,710
5 O'CLOCK IN NEW YORK CITY AND

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,378
THIS IS "THE FIVE."

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,546
IT'S THE STORY SENDING THE

6
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:14,249
COUNTRY INTO A FRENZY AND

7
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,451
SPARKING WIDESPREAD

8
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:16,885
CONVERSATIONS.

9
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:18,853
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS IT.

10
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:19,454
>> WHAT?

11
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:20,622
>> KANYE WEST HAS IT.

12
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:23,258
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:24,025
>> DRAGON ENERGY.

14
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,161
>> NO, STOP, GROSS.

15
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,163
>> INSTEAD OF FOCUSSING ON REAL

16
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:30,899
ISSUES IMPACTING RACE, WE ARE

17
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,433
FOCUSSING ON KANYE WEST WHO SAID

18
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,903
IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYTHING OF

19
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:35,270
SUBSTANCE.

20
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,339
ALL OF A SUDDEN WITH A RECORD

21
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:39,574
COMING UP, HE LIKED DONALD

22
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:39,874
TRUMP.

23
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,776
>> WHEN THE PRESIDENT BRAGS

24
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,712
ABOUT THE THINGS HE DID FOR

25
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:44,980
BLACK PEOPLE.

26
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,880
KANYE WEST DIDN'T REPRESENT

27
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,815
BLACK PEOPLE.

28
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:49,217
THIS MAN HAS BEEN LOST FOR

29
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:49,517
YEARS.

30
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:58,727
>> THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE

31
00:00:58,727 --> 00:00:59,527
PREDOMINANTLY DEMOCRATS.

32
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,763
>> I THINK KANYE WEST LOST HIS

33
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:02,063
MIND.

34
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,098
I THINK IT'S WEIRD.

35
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:08,436
>> I LOVE IT.

36
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,839
EVEN ASKED SARAH SANDERS ABOUT

37
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:12,607
IT AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS

38
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:12,941
MEETING.

39
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:15,010
>> KANYE WEST EXPRESSED HIS

40
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,379
ADMIRATION FOR THE PRESIDENT.

41
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,949
>> COVERING ALL RANGE OF TOPICS.

42
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,650
>> HAS THE PRESIDENT REACHED OUT

43
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,420
TO KANYE WEST AND WOULD HE MEET

44
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,154
AT THE WHITE HOUSE?

45
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:27,455
>> THEY MET DURING THE

46
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:27,856
TRANSITION.

47
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,091
THAT'S THE ONLY MEETING I AM

48
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,059
AWARE OF OR CONVERSATION BEFORE

49
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:32,427
EVERYBODY HAS A MELTDOWN.

50
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:36,097
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO WEIGHING

51
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,866
IN THIS WEEK.

52
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:40,468
>> HE SEES THAT STUFF AND HE IS

53
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:40,769
SMART.

54
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,538
HE SAID TRUMP IS DOING A MUCH

55
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:48,309
BETTER JOB THAN THE DEMOCRATS.

56
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,978
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMENTED

57
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:59,354
AGAIN TODAY ON KANYE WEST:

58
00:01:59,487 --> 00:01:59,821
THEY REALLY GET IT.

59
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:06,494
THIS STARTED WITH ONE 7-WORD

60
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,997
TWEET LAST SATURDAY.

61
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:13,701
I LOVE THE WAY CANDACE OWENS

62
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,035
THINK."

63
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,404
THAT COULD LEAD TO A CULTURE

64
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:17,972
SHIFT.

65
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,674
"THE FIVE" HAS AN INTERESTING

66
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,041
UPDATE.

67
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,342
CANDACE PREDICTED THIS WOULD

68
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:22,677
HAPPEN OVER A YEAR AGO.

69
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,479
>> I FIRST SAID IF YOU

70
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,548
UNDERSTOOD KANYE WEST AND YOU

71
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:29,217
CAN UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT OF

72
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:29,951
DONALD TRUMP.

73
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,886
PEOPLE CAN'T CORRELATE THAT.

74
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:35,590
IT'S SIMILAR.

75
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,192
ANTI-POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

76
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,594
>> CANDACE JOINING US TODAY.

77
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,929
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOU AND

78
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,630
WITH SPEAK WITH YOU.

79
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,299
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THIS

80
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:44,632
CHATTER.

81
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,301
YOU PREDICTED THIS AND NOW YOU

82
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,269
HAVE BECOME PART OF THIS CULTURE

83
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:48,570
SHIFT?

84
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,037
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

85
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,572
I COULD BE BIASSED.

86
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:52,841
I LOVE THE WAY CANDACE OWENS

87
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,142
THINKS AS WELL.

88
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:55,510
THIS IS BIZARRE.

89
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,579
I KNEW IT WOULD BE KANYE WEST

90
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,081
THAT WOULD BREAK THROUGH THIS

91
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:01,349
GROUP THOUGHT ON THE LEFT.

92
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,320
WHAT HE ADVOCATES THE MOST FOR

93
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,156
IN HIS MUSIC IS INDEPENDENCE.

94
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:10,358
TO BE A CONSERVATIVE MEANS YOU

95
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,293
ALLOW INDEPENDENT THINKING.

96
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,362
THEY DON'T ALLOW THAT ON THE

97
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:14,996
LEFT WHATSOEVER.

98
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,999
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF AN

99
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,534
INTERESTING TIME IN BLACK

100
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:19,868
AMERICA.

101
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,903
>> GREG, WHEN THIS FIRST

102
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,805
HAPPENED, SOMETHING IS GOING ON

103
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:24,806
HERE.

104
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,774
THIS IS A CULTURE SHIFT.

105
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,943
YOU DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS A

106
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,278
PUBLICITY STUNT?

107
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:33,915
>> PEOPLE WILL CALL YOU A

108
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,383
HYPOCRITE WHEN CELEBRITIES TALK

109
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:36,217
POLITICS AND YOU TELL THEM TO

110
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:36,818
SHUT UP.

111
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,821
YOU ARE AN ACTOR, JUST ACT.

112
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,355
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

113
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,591
THIS COMES WITH A COST TO HIS

114
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,160
REPUTATION AND FAN BASE AND

115
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,060
ALBUM SALES.

116
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,563
WHEN PEOPLE SAY HE IS DOING THIS

117
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,399
TO PROMOTE ALBUM SALES, THIS IS

118
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,369
GOING TO HURT HIM!

119
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:58,540
HE DIDN'T CHOOSE A TYPICAL

120
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,908
CUDDLY ISSUE LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE

121
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:03,311
OR BULLYING OR GUN CONTROL.

122
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:06,047
HE CHOSE THE MOST HARMFUL ISSUE.

123
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,715
THE MOST DIVISIVE ISSUE PUTTING

124
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:08,750
HIS ARMS AROUND PRESIDENT TRUMP.

125
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,621
THAT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS.

126
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:21,129
YOU ARE SEEING A CHANGE IN THE

127
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,965
INTELLECTUAL DARK WEB.

128
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:24,999
ADAMS AND ROGUE AN.

129
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,668
PEOPLE ARE SEEKING ANOTHER PLACE

130
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,836
TO FIND THE TRUTH BECAUSE THEY

131
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:29,837
ARE TIRED OF THE NARRATIVE.

132
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,739
I THINK IS PART OF THAT.

133
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,409
>> I THINK YOU OVER-STATE.

134
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:37,579
>> I TRIED TO OVER-STATE IT.

135
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,379
>> [LAUGHING].

136
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,782
>> YOU ARE OVER-STATING

137
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:41,149
SOMETHING.

138
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,884
>> THAT'S WHAT I AM AFRAID OF

139
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:43,151
IT.

140
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,886
>> I COP TO THAT.

141
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,288
THE FACT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT

142
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,924
8% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE

143
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,528
WHICH WAS A BIT OF A SPIKE FROM

144
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:55,863
WHAT MITT ROMNEY GOT 6%.

145
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:58,499
RACE IS POLITICS AND POLITICS IS

146
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:02,503
RACE IN THIS COUNTRY.

147
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,841
VAN JONES FROM CNN SAID ON

148
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:10,044
ELECTION NIGHT, THIS WAS

149
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:10,445
WHITE-LASH.

150
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,213
IT WAS ON ONE SIDE AND PEOPLE OF

151
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,581
RECALL ON THE OTHER SIDE.

152
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:17,785
THE FEROCITY OF THE REACTION OF

153
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,520
KANYE WEST'S SUPPORT OF

154
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,888
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND YOU CANDACE

155
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,223
IS A MEASURE OF THAT.

156
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:25,126
>> ROMNEY WAS AT 6% AND TRUMP AT

157
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:25,460
8%.

158
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,462
IF YOU GO TO 10% FOR A

159
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,097
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE NATIONALLY,

160
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,465
THAT BRINGS ALL DIFFERENT KINDS

161
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,533
OF COUNTIES IN PLAY.

162
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:38,373
WITH THE COUNTRY DIVIDED, THAT

163
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,941
RAZOR MARGIN COULD HAVE A

164
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:40,508
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.

165
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:45,913
WHAT SHOW DID YOU DO, CANDACE?

166
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,316
>> BEFORE KANYE WEST TWEETED ME,

167
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,284
IT WAS "WATTERS WORLD."

168
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:50,685
>> I WANTED TO ESTABLISH THAT.

169
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,353
>> [LAUGHING].

170
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:58,960
>> AND FOR JUAN WILLIAMS, I AM

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,260
SORRY.

172
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,495
>> I WISH HE WERE TODAY.

173
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:01,963
>> I PUT A HURT ON HIM.

174
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,298
HE IS STILL RECOVERING.

175
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,466
>> I WOULD SAY ONE THING, I

176
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,467
THINK KANYE WEST AND DONALD

177
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,003
TRUMP HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON

178
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:12,573
BESIDES THE DRAGON ENERGY.

179
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,510
THEY BOTH THRIVE ON CONTROVERSY.

180
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,378
BOTH ARE EGOTISTICAL.

181
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,315
BOTH ARE LOVED AND HATED.

182
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:21,582
THEY DRIVE THEIR SUPPORTERS

183
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,319
CRAZY BUT ALSO MAKE THEIR

184
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:24,886
SUPPORTERS DANCE.

185
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,922
HE SAID THIS IS NOT POLITICAL,

186
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:28,389
KANYE WEST.

187
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,624
HE SAID IT'S NOT ABOUT

188
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:30,858
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATS.

189
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,659
IT'S ABOUT INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.

190
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:34,629
I AGREE WITH THAT.

191
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,764
I DON'T THINK HE IS TALKING

192
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:37,765
ABOUT THE BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT OR

193
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,967
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT TRUMP

194
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:40,802
HAS DONE FOR THE BLACK

195
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:41,269
COMMUNITY.

196
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,171
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE POLICY, I

197
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:44,405
DON'T THINK TRUMP HAS HURT

198
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,140
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN IN COUNTRY.

199
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,876
YOU LOOK AT FOOD STAMPS ARE

200
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,811
DOWN.

201
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,779
SHOOTINGS ARE DOWN IN CHICAGO

202
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,780
AND BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT.

203
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,583
THINGS ARE NOT TERRIBLE IN THE

204
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,751
BLACK COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF

205
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,518
DONALD TRUMP'S POLICY.

206
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,188
>> THERE IS A REAL THING CALLED

207
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:00,822
DRAGON ENERGY.

208
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:01,656
IT IS REAL.

209
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:05,259
TRUMP IS A MOTIVE STAR.

210
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,261
KANYE WEST IS A MOVIE STAR.

211
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,731
THERE ARE OTHERS.

212
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:12,200
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

213
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,801
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING THE

214
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,003
CAMPAIGN DID SOME THINGS THAT

215
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,372
REALLY WERE EGREGIOUS FROM THE

216
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:20,475
POINT OF FEW FROM

217
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:20,975
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

218
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,510
>> NAME 1.

219
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,480
>> WHEN HE FEIGNED IGNORANCE OF

220
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,914
DAVID DUKE.

221
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:29,016
I DON'T KNOW DAVID DUKE.

222
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,319
I HAVE TO RESEARCH IT.

223
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,655
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, THE NEO-NAZI

224
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,759
MARCH, HE EQUATED THE 2 SIDES.

225
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,895
>> THE EXTREME LEFT WITH THE

226
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,163
EXTREME RIGHT.

227
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:44,766
>> 100%.

228
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:47,568
>> I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT,

229
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,337
FACE-TO-FACE THAT I THOUGHT HE

230
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:50,905
NEEDED TO REACH OUT.

231
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,107
I LOOKED AROUND AND EVERYBODY IN

232
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,142
MAR-A-LAGO WAS WHITE.

233
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:56,077
I SAID YOU NEED BLACK FACES

234
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:56,377
HERE.

235
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:57,111
THAT'S A REALITY.

236
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,045
HE HAS TO FACE IT.

237
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,747
THERE IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

238
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,216
WITH RACE AND POLITICS IN IN

239
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:02,550
COUNTRY.

240
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,420
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE HAS

241
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,422
DRAGON ENERGY AND IS THIS

242
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:09,457
INDEPENDENCE THINKER HAS THE

243
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,426
ABILITY TO BUST OUT OF THAT 8%.

244
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:15,496
>> CANDACE, LET'S TALK ABOUT

245
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,364
THIS.

246
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:18,499
IN TERMS OF THE CULTURE SHIFT.

247
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,967
MINORITY WOMEN AND CONSERVATIVE

248
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,104
WOMEN LIKE YOURSELF AND MYSELF

249
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:25,640
TAKE OFFENSE IS CULTURE ELITE

250
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,108
TELLING US WHAT TO THINK AND

251
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:27,508
BELIEVE.

252
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,510
WHETHER WE ARE ON THE RIGHT

253
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:35,750
TRACK OR WE ARE DELIRIOUS TO

254
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,984
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND

255
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:37,552
REPUBLICANS.

256
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:38,885
KANYE WEST IS PUSHING BACK

257
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,721
AGAINST THAT POLARIZING THINKING

258
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:44,258
THAT TRIES TO PUT PEOPLE IN

259
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,893
BOXES AND STIGMATIZE YOU.

260
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,463
>> IT'S MONOLITHIC THINKING.

261
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,164
THAT'S WHAT I AM PUNCHING BACK

262
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:50,498
AGAINST.

263
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,099
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T

264
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:52,600
MAKE SENSE.

265
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,335
WHEN YOU SAY HE NEEDS TO HAVE

266
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,369
MORE BLACK FACES.

267
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,305
THAT MEANS NOTHING.

268
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:00,408
WE SAW WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE

269
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:03,244
HAD EVERY BLACK ARTIST IN THE

270
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,046
WHITE HOUSE FOR PHOTO-OPES AND

271
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,114
CHICAGO WAS WORSE OFF.

272
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,851
I NEED TO SEE BLACK RESULTS.

273
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:15,156
IT'S INSULTING PEOPLE SAY WE

274
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:22,163
HAVE BEYONCE AND JAY-Z ON STAGE.

275
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:28,169
THAT'S AN UPHILL CHALLENGE.

276
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,738
>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

277
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,139
>> THAT'S TRUE.

278
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,543
YOU CAN SEE THAT WITH THE RECORD

279
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:39,146
LEVEL OF INCARCERATIONS OF BLACK

280
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:39,514
AMERICANS.

281
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:40,915
THERE ARE POINTS TO BE MADE HERE

282
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,617
TO SUPPORT THESE THEORIES.

283
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,552
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS

284
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:47,989
COUNTRY, THERE IS A GROUP THINK

285
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,024
TRYING TO POLLUTE YOUR MIND AND

286
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,325
DIDN'T RESPECT FREEDOM OF

287
00:09:51,325 --> 00:00:00,000
THOUGHT OR EXPRESSION.
