00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,310
WORLD.

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,947
THEY ARE AMAZING, THOSE RUSSIANS

3
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:04,681
THEY ARE AMAZING, THOSE RUSSIAN

4
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:08,151
RUSSIANS.

5
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:08,519
[LAUGHS]

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,890
ON THIS SHORE       SHOW, WE HAE

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:12,923
ON THIS SHORE       SHOW, WE HAC

8
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:12,956
ON THIS SHORE       SHOW, WE HAR

9
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:12,990
ON THIS SHORE       SHOW, WE HAN

10
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,023
ON THIS SHORE       SHOW, WE HAC

11
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:13,056
ON THIS SHORE       SHOW, WE HAE

12
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,924
ON THIS SHORE       SHOW, WE HAD

13
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:16,527
THE WAR ON STANDARDS AT THE FAA

14
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:17,194
WHERE RELEVANT BIOGRAPHICAL

15
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:19,329
QUESTIONS WERE IMPOSED ON

16
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:19,930
ASPIRING AIR TRAFFIC

17
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,731
CONTROLLERS.

18
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,333
SADLY, THIS IS FAR FROM THE ONLY

19
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,034
EXAMPLE OF STANDARDS DECLINING

20
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:26,103
IN THE UNITED STATES.

21
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:27,104
BENEATH PUBLIC VIEW, THERE IS

22
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:30,340
NEVER A DEBATE ON ANY OF THIS.

23
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,342
IT JUST HAPPENS IN SCIENTIFIC

24
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:32,743
FIELDS.

25
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:33,610
YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD COME

26
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,746
UP BUT IT IS.

27
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:36,947
HEATHER McDONALD HAS

28
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:38,949
CHRONICLED IT IN DETAIL.

29
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:39,950
HOW SCHOOLS AND OTHER

30
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,551
INSTITUTIONS ARE CUTTING

31
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,252
REQUIREMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO BE

32
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:44,388
MORE DIVERSE, WHATEVER THAT

33
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:45,155
MEANS.

34
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:47,157
HEATHER MacDONALD ALSO WROTE

35
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:49,626
THE UPCOMING BOOK, AND SHE JOINS

36
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:50,627
US TONIGHT.

37
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:51,862
HEATHER, THANK YOU FOR COMING

38
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:52,329
ON.

39
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,165
WE WERE STUNNED TO FIND THAT THE

40
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:56,834
FAA WAS INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO

41
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:00,370
HIRE UNQUALIFIED AIR TRAFFIC

42
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,138
CONTROLLERS BECAUSE IT'S INSANE

43
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:01,939
AND DANGEROUS.

44
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,707
BUT YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT SAME

45
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,342
IMPULSE WOULD FIND ITS WAY INTO

46
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:06,844
HARD SCIENCES, LIKE MEDICINE OR

47
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:09,746
RESEARCH SCIENTISTS, BUT YOU SAY

48
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:10,047
IT IS?

49
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:11,281
>> Heather: IT'S VERY

50
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,884
DISTURBING, TUCKER.

51
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:22,626
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE POINT THAT

52
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:27,331
IS FREE AND THAT'S THE

53
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:29,333
IRRELEVANT CRITERIA OF RACE AND

54
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:29,666
GENDER.

55
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,269
IT'S DOING RESEARCH ON THIS AS,

56
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:38,342
GET THIS, ENTER SEXUALITY.

57
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:40,511
THIS IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS HAD IN

58
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,079
MIND WHEN THEY CREATED THE

59
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,314
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION IN

60
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:45,716
1952 SPONSOR SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC

61
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,851
RESEARCH.

62
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:50,954
WE ARE PUTTING OUR SCIENTIFIC

63
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:53,223
COMPETITIVENESS AT GREAT RISK BY

64
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:55,092
INTRODUCING THE TOTAL

65
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,327
IRRELEVANCY OF RACE AND GENDER

66
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,229
DIVERSITY INTO SCIENTIFIC

67
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,765
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

68
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:02,399
>> Tucker: WILL CONFUSED

69
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,034
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE LEFT

70
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,435
BELIEVED IN SCIENCE, THEY HAD A

71
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:06,570
LITTLE MARCH ANNOUNCING THAT I

72
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,739
THINK ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF

73
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:09,006
AGO.

74
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,741
IS THERE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF

75
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,477
RACE OR GENDER OF A SCIENTIFIC

76
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:15,412
RESEARCHER, FOR EXAMPLE, IS

77
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:17,214
MATERIAL THAT AFFECTS THE

78
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:18,515
OUTCOME OF THE EXPERIMENT IN

79
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:21,151
SOME WAY?

80
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:22,753
>> Heather: WHILE THE LEFT

81
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,021
HATES SCIENCE WHEN IT'S PROVING

82
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:26,323
FACTS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE, AND

83
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,358
IT HATES OBJECTIVITY.

84
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:29,960
THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

85
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,829
WE HAVE HAD 200 GRANTEES OF THE

86
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,531
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION THAT

87
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,500
HAVE ONE ABOUT PRIZES.

88
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,335
THINGS LIKE DISCOVERING DARK

89
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:41,738
MATTER, DISCOVERING HOW VIRUSES

90
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:45,208
WORK, AND THIS WAS WITH UTTER

91
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,344
INDIFFERENCE.

92
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:48,712
TRUE COLOR BLINDNESS, A TRUE

93
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:49,112
MERITOCRACY.

94
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:50,514
AND THEY CAN SEE ON THE LEFT

95
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:54,318
THAT DIVERSITY MATTERS IN

96
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,586
SCIENTIFIC THINKING.

97
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:56,987
WELL, IT DOESN'T.

98
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:59,523
IF THE LAB IS ALL-FEMALE, ALL

99
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:00,557
ASIAN, ALL-BLACK, GREAT.

100
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,327
ALL THE PUBLIC CARES ABOUT IS,

101
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:04,928
ARE YOU WORKING TO CURE

102
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:05,329
ALZHEIMER'S?

103
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,231
THAT WE DO THAT IS BY BEING

104
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,399
COLOR AND GENDER BLIND AND

105
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,135
HIRING ON MERIT, NOT BASED ON

106
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:12,803
GENDER.

107
00:03:12,803 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: IT'S TERRIFYING,
