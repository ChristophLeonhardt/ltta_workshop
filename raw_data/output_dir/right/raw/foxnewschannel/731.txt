00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:05,146
THIS IS "SPECIAL REPORT" ."

2
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:07,181
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO

3
00:00:07,182 --> 00:00:08,149
WASHINGTON, I'M BRET BAIER.

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,922
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS LET

5
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:16,558
STAND THE PRESIDENT'S TRAVEL BAN

6
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:21,396
THE WHITE HOUSE HAD FRAMED THE

7
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:24,299
RULE AS CRUCIAL FOR NATIONAL

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,166
SECURITY.

9
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:26,167
OPPONENTS CALLED IT RELIGIOUS

10
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:26,968
DISCRIMINATION.

11
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:31,940
IS AT THE SUPREME COURT WITH

12
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:33,141
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY, ALONG

13
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:33,875
WITH THE IMPLICATIONS GOING

14
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:34,208
FORWARD.

15
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:36,578
GOOD EVENING.

16
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:36,945
>> HELLO.

17
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:37,779
THE MAJORITY MADE CLEAR TODAY

18
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,480
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS WELL

19
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:40,782
WITHIN HIS POWERS UNDER THE LAW

20
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:43,918
COUNTRY.

21
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,853
IT'S A VICTORY FOR THEM TODAY

22
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:47,889
BUT THIS CASE IS ACTUALLY NOT

23
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,826
OVER.

24
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:52,994
>> NO BAND, NO WALL!

25
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,430
>> AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR OF

26
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:57,165
LEGAL WRANGLING, BOSSES AND THE

27
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,167
LOWER COURT AND THREE DIFFERENT

28
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:00,201
VERSIONS OF THE PRESIDENT'S

29
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:01,402
SO-CALLED TRAVEL BAN HAS BEEN

30
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,179
PLAIN LANGUAGE, FEDERAL LAW

31
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,580
GRANTS THE PRESIDENT BROAD

32
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,848
DISCRETION TO DEFEND THE ENTRY

33
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,149
OF ALIENS INTO THE

34
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,984
UNITED STATES.

35
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:17,685
THE PRESIDENT LAWFULLY EXERCISE

36
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:19,387
THAT DISCRETION BASED ON HIS

37
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:20,321
FINDINGS FOLLOWING A WORLDWIDE

38
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,927
DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATIONAL

39
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:26,294
INTEREST.

40
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,662
>> WHAT WE ARE DOING IS LOOKING

41
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:31,366
AT COUNTRIES IN A RATIONAL WAY.

42
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:37,972
THE VETTING PROCESS WORKS AND

43
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,574
TERRORISM IS NOT A PROBLEM.

44
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:40,775
>> WITH THE MAJORITY DIDN'T DO

45
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,280
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO DECIDE

46
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:51,653
WHETHER THE BAN WAS VOTED BY

47
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:52,153
RELIGIOUS ANIMUS.

48
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,156
THE PROCLAMATION IS EXPRESSLY --

49
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,391
THE TEXT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT

50
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:56,758
RELIGION.

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,761
BUT IN ONE OF TWO PASSIONATE

52
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:00,762
DISSENT, JUSTICE SOTO

53
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:01,763
MAYOR BLAST OF THE MAJORITY FOR

54
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:03,431
NOT LOOKING TO MR. TRUMP'S

55
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:04,165
STATEMENTS.

56
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:12,140
ANTI-MUSLIM ANIMUS.

57
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,608
THE MAJORITY HOLDS OTHERWISE BY

58
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,576
IGNORING THE FACT, MISCONSTRUING

59
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,577
OUR LEGAL PRECEDENTS AND TURNING

60
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:19,781
A BLIND EYE TO THE PAIN AND

61
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:20,782
SUFFERING THE PROCLAMATION

62
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:21,949
INFLICTS UPON COUNTLESS FAMILIES

63
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,784
AND INDIVIDUALS.

64
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,920
>> THIS IS REALLY A SAD DAY FOR

65
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:26,754
AMERICA.

66
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,760
BIGOTRY AND A ISLAMOPHOBIA.

67
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,528
>> THE MAJORITY AND DISSENT ALSO

68
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:38,800
SPARRED OVER COMPARISONS TO A

69
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,168
1944 RULING UPHOLDING A

70
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,369
PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE ORDERING

71
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:41,969
JAPANESE-AMERICANS INTO

72
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,304
INTERNMENT CAMPS IN

73
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:43,738
WORLD WAR II.

74
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:48,810
THAT DECISION FOR MORE THAN

75
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,479
SEVEN DECADES AGO.

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,213
WRITING "INQUIRE MUCH OF THE

77
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,383
COURT GAVE A PASS TO AN ODIOUS,

78
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,251
GREATLY INJURIOUS RACIAL

79
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:59,554
PACIFICATION AUTHORIZED BY AN

80
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,361
REJECTED THE COMPARISON."

81
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:08,129
KOREMATSU HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

82
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,971
NEUTRAL POLICY DENYING CERTAIN

83
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:17,705
FOREIGN NATIONALS THE PRIVILEGE

84
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:18,773
OF ADMISSION.

85
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:20,174
>> THE CASE DOESN'T END HERE

86
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:23,945
OR NOT AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE

87
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,747
TRAVEL BAN 3.0 COULD STAND

88
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:26,481
BURIED TODAY WITH THIS GUIDANCE

89
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,549
FROM THE JUSTICE IT GOES BACK TO

90
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,353
THE LOWER COURT FOR A DECISION

91
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:32,920
ACTUALLY ON THE MERIT.

92
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,722
>> Bret: THERE WAS ALSO

93
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:38,159
ANOTHER RULING INVOLVING A

94
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,995
CRISIS CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA.

95
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,163
>> THEY MANAGED TO SCOOP UP ALL

96
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,264
THE PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS,

97
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,199
ALMOST ALL OF THEM IN THE STATES

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,567
ESSENTIALLY TELLING THEM THEY

99
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,969
HAD TO PROVIDE ALL KINDS OF

100
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,736
INFORMATION TO POTENTIAL CLIENTS

101
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:50,438
INCLUDING ABOUT WHERE THEY COULD

102
00:03:58,981 --> 00:03:59,781
HAVE TWO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO

103
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,182
CARRY THEIR PREGNANCIES TO TERM.

104
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:03,618
IT WAS A 5-4 DECISION WRITTEN BY

105
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,789
GOOD CHANCE THESE CLINICS WERE

106
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,891
GOING TO PREVAIL TO THE MERIT SO

107
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:10,992
HE SET THE CASE BACK TO

108
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:12,293
CALIFORNIA TO DEAL WITH IT.

109
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,162
>> Bret: STILL WAITING ON ONE

110
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:14,462
MORE?

111
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,463
>> TOMORROW WE ARE WAITING ON A

112
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,464
BIG CASE ON WHETHER OR NOT

113
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,331
PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES CAN BE
