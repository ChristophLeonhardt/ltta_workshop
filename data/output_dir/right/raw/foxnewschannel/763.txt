00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:03,811
[♪♪♪]

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:07,982
JESSE: WELCOME TO "WATTERS

3
00:00:07,982 --> 00:00:10,384
WORLD," I'M JESSE WATTERS.

4
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,153
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK WAS A

5
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:15,322
REFRESHER FOR HOW DISHONEST THE

6
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:18,792
LEFT IS AND THEIR LAP DOGS IN

7
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:20,227
THE MEDIA.

8
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:22,396
THE OBAMA POLICY ON THE BORDER

9
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,164
WAS CATCH AND RELEASE.

10
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:27,334
BUT THE ILLEGALS SKIPPED THE

11
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:29,637
HEARINGS AND WENT UNCHECKED INTO

12
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:31,071
THE COUNTRY.

13
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:34,008
THIS POLICY ENCOURAGED ILLEGAL

14
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:34,908
IMMIGRATION.

15
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,244
TRUMP WAS ELECTED TO SECURE THE

16
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:37,578
BORDER.

17
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:40,280
THAT'S WHAT THE VOTERS WANTED.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,419
SO HE ENACTED A ZERO TOLERANCE

19
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:46,553
POLICY AT THE BORDER.

20
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:49,089
IF YOU BRING A MINOR, YOU ARE

21
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:51,058
BRIEFLY SEPARATED FOR A DAY OR

22
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:53,927
TWO THEN REUNITED THEN DEPORTED.

23
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:57,364
BUT IF YOU BRING A MINOR AND

24
00:00:57,364 --> 00:01:00,234
CAN'T PROVE USUAL RELATED THE

25
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,736
FEDS WILL SEPARATE AND

26
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:07,341
INVESTIGATE IF YOU ARE A HUMAN

27
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:09,977
TRAFFICKER OR CHILD SMUGGLER.

28
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:12,946
THE COURT SAYS THEY CAN'T HOLD

29
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:17,151
THE CHILD FOR MORE THAN 20 DAYS

30
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:20,821
AND THEN MUST SEND THE CHILD TO

31
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:24,291
A FAMILY MEMBER OR FOSTER UNTIL

32
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:29,329
THE CLAIMS CAN BE COMPLETED.

33
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:32,666
OBAMA DID THE SAME THING.

34
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,802
TRUMP JUST DID IT AT A HIGHER

35
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:38,372
RATE BECAUSE ALL BORDER CROSSERS

36
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:40,007
ARE BEING PROSECUTED.

37
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,209
>> SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS

38
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,211
COUNTRY WHERE OUTRAGED BY THE

39
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:46,847
CAGES AND THE THERMAL BLANKETS

40
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:49,750
AND THE FACILITIES HOUSING THESE

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,651
KIDS.

42
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,187
THEY WERE ALL THERE UNDER

43
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:54,188
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

44
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:57,124
DID YOU SPEAK UP AGAINST THEM

45
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:57,424
THEN?

46
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:02,429
>> ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE GET

47
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:03,964
INTO A MOMENT WHERE WE ARE

48
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:07,234
MAKING PROGRESS, THEN WHEN IT

49
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:08,669
STALLS, WE TURN AROUND.

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,871
I THINK WE ALL NEED TO CONTINUE

51
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,841
TO BE FOCUSED ON IT AND PRESS IT

52
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:14,174
THROUGH.

53
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,677
JESSE: WHAT WAS THAT SENATOR?

54
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,712
WAS THAT EVEN ENGLISH?

55
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:20,347
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST

56
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:20,914
SAID.

57
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,117
FOR THE RECORD THE DEMOCRATS

58
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:25,919
DON'T WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

59
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,788
THEY WANT TO BLAME PROBLEMS ON

60
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:29,556
TRUMP AND DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

61
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:32,092
HOW DO I KNOW THIS?

62
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:35,229
SENATOR CRUZ RELEASED A STAND

63
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:37,698
ALONE BILL THAT WOULD KEEP

64
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,032
CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS

65
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,968
TOGETHER AND THE DEMOCRATS

66
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,770
WOULDN'T VOTE ON IT BECAUSE THEY

67
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,438
WANTED TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON

68
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:44,972
TRUMP.

69
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:47,441
IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF DEMOCRATS

70
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,144
CARE AT ALL ABOUT KIDS.

71
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:51,678
JIMMY KIMMEL LED THE CHARGE.

72
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:54,114
>> JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT WE

73
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:56,617
COULDN'T GO ANY LOWER AS A

74
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,019
NATION, I AM SURE YOU HAVE SEEN

75
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,755
THE HEARTBREAKING IMAGES OF

76
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:03,457
FAMILIES BEING LITERALLY TORN

77
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:08,262
APART THANKS TO THE TRUMP

78
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:08,595
POLICY.

79
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,230
JESSE: CONGRESS MAKES

80
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,699
IMMIGRATION LAW, NOT THE

81
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:13,367
PRESIDENT.

82
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,003
THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SIGN AN

83
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:18,539
EXECUTIVE ORDER URGING FEDERAL

84
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,377
AGENTS TO KEEP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

85
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,711
FAMILIES TOGETHER AND DEPORT

86
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:27,748
THEM TOGETHER.

87
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:31,084
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WE'LL KEEP

88
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,553
FAMILIES TOGETHER BUT THE BORDER

89
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:34,755
WILL BE JUST AS TOUGH AS IT'S

90
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,056
BEEN.

91
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,358
DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

92
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,961
IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES, JOBS,

93
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,862
HOSPITALS.

94
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:44,398
DEMOCRATS PUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

95
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,166
BEFORE THEY PUT AMERICAN

96
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:46,633
CITIZENS.

97
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:50,103
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

98
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,005
JESSE: FAMILIES STAY TOGETHER

99
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:54,575
AND WE STILL HAVE A BORDER.

100
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,877
EVERYONE IS HAPPY, RIGHT?

101
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:57,411
WRONG.

102
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:01,014
>> FAMILIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

103
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:03,984
WILL BE LOCKED UP TOGETHER,

104
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,385
HOPEFULLY STARTING WITH HIS.

105
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,955
JESSE: THE LEFT IS NEVER HAPPY.

106
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,257
IT IS NEVER ABOUT POLICY.

107
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:13,427
IT'S ABOUT POLITICAL SCORING.

108
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,429
NO MATTER WHAT TRUMP DOES, HE'LL

109
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:18,632
BE ATTACKED BY THE MEDIA.

110
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:20,267
REMEMBER WHEN HE RAN FOR

111
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,035
PRESIDENT HE PROMISED TO BOMB

112
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:24,104
THE HELL OUT OF ISIS.

113
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:25,539
>> DROPPING BOMBS.

114
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:28,375
YOU HAVE TO HAVE TARGETS TO DROP

115
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,743
BOMBS ON.

116
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,378
IT'S AN APPLAUSE LINE FOR PEOPLE

117
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:32,713
WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE.

118
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:36,183
JESSE: WHEN TRUMP DEFEATED THE

119
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:39,453
ISIS CALIPHATE, INSTEAD OF

120
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:45,392
REPORTING ON HIS SUCCESS, HERE

121
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:47,461
WERE THE HEADLINES.

122
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:50,597
REMEMBER WHEN THE MEDIA WENT

123
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,099
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR NOT

124
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,736
GOING TO PORT ARE YOU KEY SOON

125
00:04:55,736 --> 00:05:01,174
ENOUGH -- TO PUERTO RICO SOON

126
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,042
ENOUGH AFTER THE HURRICANE?

127
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,511
>> HE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

128
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,281
ONE THING ONLY.

129
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,650
PUERTO RICO, PUERTO RICO, PUERTO

130
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,450
RICO.

131
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,419
JESSE: WHEN HE DID GO, THEY

132
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,755
DIDN'T LIKE HOW HE HAND OUT

133
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:15,122
SUPPLIES.

134
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:18,692
>> THIS WAS A P.R.17-MINUTE

135
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:19,159
MEETING.

136
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:22,729
THERE WAS NO EXCHANGE.

137
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:24,665
THIS TERRIBLE ABOMINABLE VIEW OF

138
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:27,567
HIM THROWING PAPER TOWELS AND

139
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:28,869
PROVISIONS AT PEOPLE.

140
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:32,906
IT DOES NOT EMBODY THE SPIRIT OF

141
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,341
THE AMERICAN NATION.

142
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:37,611
JESSE: TRUMP WAS SAVAGED FOR HIS

143
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,179
STRONG STANCE ON NORTH KOREA.

144
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:42,249
>> THIS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HAS

145
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,851
ANGER AND HOSTILITY AND

146
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:46,420
BELLICOSE RHETORIC AND THINGS

147
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,854
THAT AREN'T HELPFUL.

148
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:50,924
WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH AN

149
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:51,925
ADVERSARY LIKE NORTH KOREA.

150
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:54,895
JESSE: THEN WHEN HE ENGAGED IN

151
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:56,997
THE DIPLOMACY THE MEDIA WAS

152
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:59,299
PLEADING FOR, THIS WAS FRAMED AS

153
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,067
A LOSS.

154
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,236
>> SUMMIT IS NOT AN

155
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:04,304
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THIS

156
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:05,105
PRESIDENT.

157
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:06,840
IT'S A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR

158
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,307
KIM JONG-UN.

159
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,743
>> THERE IS NOTHING

160
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,278
UNPRECEDENTED ABOUT TRUMP'S

161
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,814
FIRST SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE.

162
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:14,681
ECONOMICALLY ANYWAY.

163
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:17,317
JESSE: NOW THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT

164
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:18,885
RATE DROPPED TO THE LOWEST IT'S

165
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:21,955
BEEN IN 20 YEARS, WE HEAR THIS.

166
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:25,826
>> HIP HIP HOORAY, EMPLOYMENT IS

167
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:27,661
DOWN, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO ME

168
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:28,662
IN MY LIFE.

169
00:06:28,662 --> 00:00:00,000
JESSE: THE MEDIA IS NOT COVERING
