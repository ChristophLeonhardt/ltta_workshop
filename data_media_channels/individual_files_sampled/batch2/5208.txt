tonight is not a good night to be Michael Cohen for years Trump's personal lawyer cultivated an image as the ultimate fixer he even compared himself to the TV character Ray Donovan who does anything to protect the boss we've done bad things ray I've asked you to fix things that should never have been fixed terrible things terrible things kind of funny that you'd make that comparison to yourself but Cohen leans into it he even tweeted hashtag loyalty hashtag ray Donovan hashtag fixer but in these 10 days since the feds raided Cohn's home in office the fixer can't fix his own problems and they are stacking up considered the wider implications of just the last 24 hours the man who preceded him as Trump's lawyer publicly revealing he's warning Trump Cohen will flip we talked about that tonight the National Inquirer now giving up and settling with the former Playboy model who says Cohen tried to keep her quiet we just interviewed her lawyer about that that problem and Cohen dropped his libel suit against BuzzFeed infusion gps over what he claimed was defamation in the infamous Russia dossier that decision is key remember the dossier alleges that Cohen secretly met with Kremlin officials in Prague to clean up the mess left by manna fort and then to talk about quote how deniable cash payments were made to hackers in Europe who worked under Kremlin Direction against the Clinton campaign I read that to you it's not verified but that is what collusion would look like if it were true and I report to you accurately Cohen has denied at all but I'm almost a year later here after BuzzFeed publishes that dossier after he sues for defamation which at the time got him a lot of praise enough is enough president Trump's personal lawyer taking legal action against that quote fake Russian dossier here's a private citizen doing his job and they accused him not of jaywalking they accused him essentially of treason and I think he should defend himself and it's a legitimate defamation lawsuit a false statement incredibly the dossier is false that damages somebody's name and reputation I'm glad Michael Cohen is fighting back true doesn't matter truth does matter and if it is a legitimate defamation suit you could continue it and maybe win it even during this criminal investigation that just changed this is super important Cohen's not fighting back anymore in fact while Cohen claims that his basic suit there would have merit he says he now doesn't have the time to do this case the decision to drop the lawsuit comes though just days after a report that Muller is confirming part of the dossiers claims about Cohen we haven't confirmed that here at NBC if Cohen did meet with Russian officials in Prague if the claims in the dossier are even partly true then obviously he has no defamation case BuzzFeed says Cohen's decision shows he quote no longer thinks an attack on the Free Press is worth his time Fusion adds mr. Cohen can now focus on as many other legal travails which he has prosecutors investigating him for bank fraud wire fraud campaign finance issues which is why Jay Goldberg Trump's lawyer before Cohen says there's no question Cohen will flip well I don't think that Michael Cohen comes to trumps office with some sterling record with a background that's would be attractive to me so I don't know whether he's ever handled litigation for Trump do you think that Donald Trump made a mistake in putting so much faith in Michael Cohen well that remains to be seen that remains to be seen you're not just looking at any legal commentator there by the way as we've emphasized in our reporting night you're looking at the man who was literally the predecessor to Michael Cohen and is currently advising president Trump and he's questioning the loyalty of this man who really defined himself with loyalty to Trump Donald Trump is this uber billionaire real estate developer possibly the greatest negotiator in the history of this planet I'm obviously very loyal and very dedicated to mr. Trump I'll do anything to protect mr. Trump the family Cohen didn't just flatter he took on opponents with relish a whining baby he's a horrible human being as far as I'm concerned but for the filegate pardon gate shiny gate travel game you and I should go into business buying gates right when it comes to the Clintons you guys are down and it makes us that there would chose most of them all of them says who there were facts there that he wasn't willing to deal with and while his lawyers have been in court lately Cohen famously was hanging out with friends smoking cigars in fact we looked into this if you look at the company he's keeping here ABC News has identified some of the people in this picture the man in the blue jacket and glasses a real estate developer who attended to Miss Universe pageant in Moscow with Trump in 2013 and was reportedly part of Cohen's attempt to build a Trump Tower there the other man again this is who he's hanging out with during all of this this week is a former executive for Deutsche Bank which fronted Trump hundreds of millions of dollars now Cohen can talk to whomever he wants but in the middle of an investigation sparked by the Russia probe those are interesting choices it makes it appear he's not worried even if his friends are I think is a very high threshold to get that warrant and so I would if I were Michael I would be a little concerned about that I worry about Michael I didn't say Michael's gonna lie I worry about Michael I worry about Michael if Michael Collins friends his Trump allies were worried about him back before the FBI raid how are they feeling tonight hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
