on Thursday the Department of Homeland Security announced its official revocation of President Obama's executive amnesty for illegal immigrant parents according to the Associated Press quote Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly formally revoked a policy memo that created the deferred action for parents of Americans program the revocation came on the fifth anniversary of another effort that has protected hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation in reality Obama's DAPA program deferred action for parents arrival program never took effect the federal judge had stayed at pointing out that Obama had exceeded his authority it's unclear whether Trump is actually going to begin supporting more illegal immigrant parents especially since Trump administration has continued to fight back against deportation of so-called dreamers actually in the exact same memo announcing the revocation of DAPA the homeland security secretary said the deferred action for childhood arrivals have remained in place breaking a key campaign promise as Daniel Horowitz of Conservative review pointed out last week quote Trump's DHS has issued almost 125,000 daca cars per Obama's unlawful deferred action for childhood arrivals ordered to illegal aliens through the second quarter of this fiscal year January through March this surpasses the 122,000 level of amnesty cards issued during the final quarter of Obama's presidency October 1st through December 31st 2016 which means the Trump administration is not even slowing down the pace just last week Kelley assured Congress we are not not not targeting daca registrants right now and pled with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform so will the Trump administration actually begin keeping its commitment to begin supporting those Obama attempted to protect under DAPA it's difficult to tell that uncertainty is still a step up from the Obama administration's obvious unwillingness to consider deportation for entire classes of illegal immigrants and Trump's bakery has had some predictable results the number of people attempting to cross the border illegally has dropped dramatically but there is no question that the Trump administration's open position on daca is a new shocking development for a president who pledged widespread deportations of illegal immigrants as a key campaign promise I'm Ben Shapiro

calm okay so I want to talk a little bit before we get to president Trump's Twitter I want to talk about a problem that I see arising on the right and it's a mistake that's being made in response to the left being awful on issues of free speech left has been awful on issues for free speech for years I should know when I speak on college campuses I get protested there sometimes riots I've been banned from college campuses and the left uses a particular logic when it comes to this the particularly odjick that the left uses when it comes to banning me is that words violence words prompt violence therefore we can't have Shapiro here if Shapiro says the man is a man and a woman is a woman then that could prompt somebody to do something nasty to a transgender person and therefore we have to ban Shapiro from campus this is sort of the perspective at DePaul if Shapiro says that black lives matter is a negative movement that hurts black people and he says the cops are deliberately murdering black people on mass that hurts black people black people feel bad and not only they feel bad maybe it will prompt some violence against black people in some unspecified way therefore we have to keep Shapiro off campus now typically the right has responded to this nonsense of mockery right we call them snowflakes we say this is microaggression culture it's a bunch of nonsense but now because the left for so long has been blaming acts of violence individual acts of violence on the so called toxic climate created by the right now the right finally has its chance to do the same things left and some people are unwilling to forgo the revenge in favor of the actual principle which is actually dangerous if you are more interested in revenge on the left than you are in upholding a principle to prevent the left from winning then you are doing something counterproductive so in the aftermath of this Bernie Sanders supporting Trump hating terrorists trying to shoot a bunch of Congress people and succeeding Steve Scalise is still in apparently critical condition in the hospital there are a lot of people on the right who have been making the mistake of essentially claiming that rhetoric causes violence anomaly is rhetoric cause violence is leftist rhetoric and not just leftist violent rhetoric which okay but leftist normal rhetoric like stuff that exists in the realm of the normal this is dangerous so I think that you know the natural tendency after a horrible terrorist incident like this occurs is for everybody to come together the problem is when the coming together is about civility and niceness and then anytime somebody says something that is inflammatory or passionate about politics is out shut that guy down he might cause a nutcase to go and shoot somebody you're starting to see this happen so Scott Pelley over at CBS News he says violence almost always begins with words this is going to be the new routine later at a lunch for reporters President Trump was asked whether he worried that that language would incite violence his paws indicated it had never crossed his mind and then he said no that doesn't worry me as children were taught words will never hurt me but when you think about it violence almost always begins with words in Twitter world we've come to believe that our first thought is our best thought it's past time for all of us presidents politicians reporters citizens all of us to pause to think again okay so you can see why the left is doing this okay so the left is saying this the left is doing this because they specifically are interested in pressing forward the the right is uncivil the right is terrible how dare the right use the kind of language that's been using Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi did a joint interview yesterday at the Congressional baseball game in which they did a little bit of the same routine how do you balance letting Republicans in your caucus speak their mind while also setting setting a roll I love being a role model and saying that's too far you've gone too far don't say that which happens sometimes in soldiers offices sure but I think all of us have a responsibility to watch our rhetoric but we were passionate we believed passionately about our causes about our issues and we can do that without being vitriolic without omentum the kind of anger that's out there in the country so that's what leaders do and that's what members of Congress have in common upon them okay that's all fine this is all fine this is all unified but here's what's happened the left has now turned to okay Trump's rhetoric is really dangerous it's going to get people killed right Trump the right their rhetoric can get people killed your Senator Richard Blumenthal who is a radical leftist from Connecticut making exactly this case need to seize this moment and tone down the rhetoric I know that's easier said than done and part of the problem is that the president is continuing the very visceral and vehement attacks instead of saying as my colleague senator Rubio said that he welcomes a swift result and a fair result to this investigation and again it's amazing a leftist shoots up a Republican congressional baseball practice and the response is clearly that the Republican rhetoric is the problem the Republican rhetoric and I can see why people on the right get angry that's right Jeff Flake did some of the same stuff yesterday this is the senator from Arizona he says that you know Trump should stop calling people losers that's the real problem here when you say you want the president to lead is there something specific you think he could do that would maybe be a positive jolt to the system well the things that he could stop doing you know referring to others in the other party as losers or or using other language that just isn't becoming and is it's done on our side as well and certainly the president's opponent use that kind of language the language police are here so here's how the right to respond to the language police with blur I should say is what I said yesterday violent rhetoric is not okay defending violence is not okay but passionate rhetoric you know the normal passionate rhetoric of every day that stuff is not only okay it's necessary in a republic okay it's always existed in a republic that doesn't mean that it's all factual it doesn't mean it's all good but it is necessary and to pretend that it's going to stop is just it's just a cudgel to wield against the other side so laura ingraham i think that's exactly wrong there's going to be a rare situation in which I think that Laura Ingraham is wrong and Nancy Pelosi is kind of right which is just unbelievably shocking and it just demonstrates how people on either side of the aisle partisanship Trump's principle here's Laura Ingraham talking about leftist rhetoric and what she thinks causes violence but it's a level of viciousness and vitriol that we see on social media but usually that's an anonymous thing but help you blur emboldened and they're actually saying it in person they're doing shock drawings of people and their families on their driveways so they wake up in the morning and they say a chalk drawing but I think Charles is right this apocalyptic language we hear on other cable networks where they are these are supposedly very respected hosts who get up every morning and say will our republic survive Donald Trump in other words the resistance is a physical resistance if you believe your survival is at risk it's almost you have a moral duty to physically resist that okay again this is so hypocritical and I'll explain why in a second Nancy Pelosi says the right needs to stop being sanctimonious about this stuff yes because I think the what should stop being sanctimonious about a years ago people should stop being sanctimonious about the idea that Sarah Palin putting out on her website of congressional districts that she wants to target somehow leads to people dying what should stop saying that talk radio leads to the Oklahoma City bombing and the right should not imitate the left in an act of revenge here's Nancy Pelosi saying that the right is being sanctimonious yes and the left should also stop being sanctimonious and I think that the comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous beneath the dignity of the job that they hold the needs of dignity of the respect that we would like Congress to command how dare they say such a thing how dare they I well I don't even go into the whole thing I can't even be getting caricatures of me and George at once again we're in over a hundred million dollars of vitriolic things that they say that resulted in calls to my homes constantly threats in front of my grandchildren even really predicated on their comments and their paid ads so this sick individual does something despicable and it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all of a sudden be sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't even go into the President of the United States okay and the reason that I think that she's not wrong here is because he heard Laura Ingraham there say this apocalyptic language we hear on other cable networks okay I was alive six months ago I remember when people are on Fox News were saying on a routine basis that the world was going to end if Hillary Clinton was elected in fact this was the best argument in favor of President Trump okay here is the fact the most read essay of the last election cycle in right wing intellectual circles was the flight 93 essay in the Claremont Review of Books we talked about it at the time it was quoted breathlessly by everybody from Rush Limbaugh to Laura Ingraham to Sean Hannity to my friend Dennis Prager I mean it was quoted everywhere and the basic idea there was that if Hillary Clinton was elected that the plane of state would crash and everyone would die it literally said in that essay charged the cockpit or you die okay Ann Coulter said that Hillary's election would be the quote end of them erricka then it said that America could quote never recover from her or any Democrats victory Ingram herself who's talking about apocalyptic language she wrote a piece two weeks ago but two weeks before the election tidal quote how the elites blew up the world now is my point that nobody should ever use language like this know precisely the opposite my point is that this has always been the language of politics it may not be right I may disagree with this language I may have thought that all those people were wrong about the last election cycle and I may have thought their apocalyptic language was wrong in fact I did I said that the plate 93 essay was stupid and incoherent but the fact is nobody who read that essay actually thought that this is a flight 93 election nobody thought Hillary was elected it was time to go pick up a gun and start shooting Democrats nobody thought that when Dennis said that America would never recover from Hillary's presidency that that meant that it was time to go and violently uprise against the Democratic Party when Ingram said the elites blow up the world nobody actually thought that Trump should go out there and commit bombings in response right we always use this kind of rhetoric this rhetoric is not new okay we've been using rhetoric with the war on drugs the war on poverty FDR targeted the quote malefactors of great wealth this stuff goes back all the way in the American Republic the language of people being enemies but we all understand there's a baseline level understanding we're not actually enemies there's a difference between the Democrats with whom we argue and Isis that actually wants to chop off our head and I think that Republicans are making a huge mistake if they feed the snowflakes don't feed the snowflakes don't feed the snowflakes do not buy into the idea that is now being promulgated by the right because we want to stick the left space in it that rhetoric leads to violence normal political rhetoric that is edgy and passionate leads to violence it is very difficult to claim that college campuses should allow people like me or Heather McDonald or Charles Murray or ayaan Hirsi Ali let alone my lowly innopolis speak at the same time they say the word resistance could cause violence when we're Ingram says you know the resistance that means physical resistance that's the dumbest crap I've ever heard okay it's really stupid no one in the resistance or at least very few people in the quote-unquote resistance think it's time to pick up a gun and start shooting people if they do they are outliers there are truly violent people like an Tifa I don't want to lump in everybody who's on the other side of the aisle with an Tifa because that's not fair and it's not right as begging it is begging for the next time somebody who has a mention of Sean Hannity in their manifesto or Laura Ingraham in their manifesto it is begging the left to do the exact same routine on us that makes the political situation up we are not better it never gets more civil it just uses civility as a club to beat the other side and then we say okay well you're beating us up so we're going to be even less civil to you it just leads to a downward spiral in both civility and the level of political discourse that is really really really stupid okay before I go any further I want to talk about President Trump I had a tweet storm this morning about obstruction
