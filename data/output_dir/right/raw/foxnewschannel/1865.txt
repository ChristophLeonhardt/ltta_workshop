MORE GOOD WILL GESTURES

00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:10,336
APPARENTLY FROM NORTH KOREA IN

7
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:12,638
THEIR RUN UP TO THIS SUMMIT NOW

00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,108
ANNOUNCED FOR JUNE 12TH BETWEEN

9
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:17,176
KIM JONG UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.

10
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:18,811
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS

00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,480
REPORTEDLY TELLING U.N. CIVIL

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,082
AVIATION AUTHORITY OFFICIALS

13
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:25,117
THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER BE

14
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:27,119
CONDUCTING UNANNOUNCED ICBM OR

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,821
MID RANGE MISSILE TESTS BECAUSE,

16
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,556
IN THEIR WORDS, THERE'S NO NEED.

17
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,091
THEY ALREADY HAVE FINISHED THEIR

18
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:33,059
NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

19
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,360
NOW, THIS IS IMPORTANT, JULIE,

20
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,862
BECAUSE WITH ALL THE TALK OF

21
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:37,596
DENUCLEARIZATION, WE'VE HEARD

22
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:39,765
LESS TALK ABOUT LIMITING THE

23
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:40,833
MEANS OF GETTING THOSE WEAPONS

24
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:41,567
TO THE TARGETS LIKE THE UNITED

25
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,736
STATES.

26
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:45,538
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MISSILES.

27
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:46,605
MEANWHILE, THERE ARE MORE

28
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,741
INDICATIONS THAT NORTH KOREA

29
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,343
MIGHT BE MOVING TO CLOSE DOWN

30
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,345
ITS ONE KNOWN NUCLEAR TESTING

31
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:52,979
SITE.

32
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,180
ACCORDING TO SATELLITE

33
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,414
PHOTOGRAPHY AND SOME EXPERTS,

34
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:57,550
THERE HAVE BEEN SIX STRUCTURES

35
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,219
REMOVED FROM THAT SITE JUST IN

36
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,220
THE PAST TWO WEEKS.

37
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,688
REMEMBER, NORTH KOREA PROMISING

38
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,456
TO DISMANTLE THAT SITE AND SHOW

39
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,424
IT TO INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS

40
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:06,659
AND EVEN JOURNALISTS.

41
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,460
BUT OF COURSE, THERE'S ANOTHER

42
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,862
REPORT IN THE PAST DAY, JULIE,

43
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,297
THAT SAYS THAT THIS SITE IS TOO

44
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:12,365
DAMAGED TO BE USED AGAIN.

45
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,833
ALWAYS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

46
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,700
>> Julie: OH, YES.

47
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,802
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE FREE

48
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:18,938
DETAINEES AND PLANS FOR THE

49
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:19,438
SUMMIT?

50
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:20,506
>> SUPER NEWS.

51
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:22,842
SUPER NEWS ABOUT THE FREED

52
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:23,943

REPORTS WE'RE GETTING IS THEY

57
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:31,817
ARE IN GOOD SPIRITS.

58
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:32,885
THEY'RE COPING WELL.

59
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:37,523
AND WE'RE LEARNING THEKTD --

60
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:38,791
THEY COULD BE REUNITED WITH

61
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,492
THEIR FAMILIES TODAY.

62
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:41,260
WE MAY GET A GLIMPSE OF THAT.

63
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,229

COUNTRY, CITY, STATE, NO

00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:53,773
LOCATION YET.

71
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:55,441
IN HINDSIGHT, IT'S A GOOD CHOICE

72
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:57,510
ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS.

73
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,944

LAST LONGER THAN 24 HOURS.

82
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:11,357
BUT GENERALLY, WE'RE THINKING

83
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:13,025
IT'S GOING TO BE A ONE DAY

84
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:15,594
