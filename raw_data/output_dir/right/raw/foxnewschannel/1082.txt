THEY ARE CAUGHT CROSSING THE

00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:04,877

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,881
OUR NEXT GUEST IS VERY FAMILIAR

8
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,083
WITH JUST HOW TOUGH IT IS TO GET

9
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,852
SOMETHING DOWN ON IMMIGRATION ON

10
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:13,285
CAPITOL HILL.

11
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:14,086
HIS CONSERVATIVE CRITICS SAY

12
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:16,489
DURING THE TIME HE WAS HERE HE

13
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:17,857
SUPPORTIVE MEASURES THEY EQUATE

14
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:18,657
TO AMNESTY.

15
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,359
AFTER STINTS IN CONGRESS AND AS

16
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,862
FLORIDA'S AGRICULTURAL

00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:23,662
COMMISSIONER, ADAM PUTNAM IS NOW

00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:27,066
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US, SIR.

21
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,134

SEVENTH GENERATION FLUORINE,

25
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:34,340
ALWAYS INTERESTED IN WHAT

26
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,445
HAPPENS DOWN THERE.

27
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:40,679
ALWAYS INTERESTING IN THE

28
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,248
BROADER SENSE OF DEBATES ABOUT

29
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:42,681
IMMIGRATION.

30
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:43,849
I KNOW YOU COME FROM AN

31
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:44,817
AGRICULTURAL AREA IN CENTRAL

32
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:45,484
FLORIDA.

33
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:46,986
ONE OF THE TILE THANKS TO SQUARE

34
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:48,254
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, MAKING SURE

35
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:49,388
THERE ARE WORKERS FOR THOSE

36
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:51,123
BUSINESSES AND MAKING SURE THEY

37
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:52,024
ARE HERE LEGALLY.

38
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,726
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING FROM

39
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:55,561
ONE OF YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUES,

40
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,161
CONGRESSMAN DENNIS ROSS,

41
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,264
REPUBLICAN FROM FLORIDA.

42
00:00:58,264 --> 00:00:59,665
>> I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IS

43
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:01,433
SOMETHING WE WILL DO LATER IN

44
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:02,268
THE FUTURE, BEEN HERE LONG

45
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:04,036
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE TEACHER

46
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:04,470
NEVER COMES.

47
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,071
I WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN.

48
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:10,042
I'M HOLDING OUT ON SIGNING A

49
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,544
DISCHARGE PETITION UNTIL I CAN

50
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:13,546
GET SOME PUBLIC GUARANTEE THAT

51
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:14,880
WE WILL TAKE THE GUEST WORKER

52
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,149
PROGRAM THAT HELPS NOT ONLY OUR

53
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,251
EGG COMMUNITIES, CONSTRUCTION

54
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:19,852
COMMUNITIES, AND SERVICE

55
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:20,853
COMMUNITIES.

56
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:21,287
WE NEEDED TO.

57
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,888
>> Shannon: HOW DO YOU BALANCE

58
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:24,423
ALL OF THOSE INTERESTS?

59
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:27,259
>> I THINK CONGRESSMAN ROSS IS

60
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,627
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO MAKE SURE

61
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:30,796
THAT THERE IS A TOTAL SOLUTION.

62
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:33,632
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LED THE WAY

63
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:34,199
WITH HIS PILLARS PLAN.

64
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,504
SECURE OUR BORDERS, REFORM THE

65
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:40,606
CHAIN MIGRATION, PARTICULARLY ON

66
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,341
EXTENDED FAMILY, AND THE VISA

67
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:45,244
LOTTERY PROGRAM, AND BRING A

68
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:45,911
PERMANENT SOLUTION TO DACA.

69
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:47,780
YOU KNOW FROM YOUR TIME IN

70
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,514
FLORIDA THAT THE GUEST WORKER

71
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:51,150
PROGRAM IS A LEGAL MECHANISM TO

72
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,485
MEET THE NEEDS OF THE TOURISM

73
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,254
INDUSTRY, THE CONSTRUCTION

74
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:56,188
INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY,

75
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,456
AND PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF WAITING

76
00:01:57,456 --> 00:02:00,492
ON WASHINGTON.

77
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:02,428
WASHINGTON JUST FAILS TO DELIVER

78
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:04,496
A SOLUTION TO OUR BROKEN

79
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:05,564
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND THAT IS

80
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:06,532
WHY I WAS THRILLED TO BE JOINED

81
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:09,634
TODAY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

82
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:10,301
SHERIFFS AS I ROLLED OUT MY

83
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:14,273
SECURE FLORIDA PLAN, WHICH

84
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:16,775
INCLUDES THE SAFETY AND SECURITY

85
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,344
OF FLORIDA WITH REESTABLISHING

86
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:22,748
THAT TO SECURE COMMUNITIES PROGR

87
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:22,982
THAT TO SECURE COMMUNITIES PROGM

88
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:23,716
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REINSTATED.

89
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,517
IN OTHER WORDS, THE STATE OF

90
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,620
FLORIDA SHOULD HAVE THAT

91
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,855
RELATIONSHIP WITH I.C.E. BECAUSE

92
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,256
FLORIDA TAXPAYERS ARE SICK OF

93
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:31,857
PAYING TENS OF MILLIONS

94
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:36,228
OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO FEED AND

95
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:38,330
HOUSE AND     IN OUR PRISON SYSE

96
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:38,631
HOUSE AND     IN OUR PRISON SYS,

97
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,298
CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO

98
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,467
OUGHT TO BE IN THE CUSTODY OF

99
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,869
THE FEDS AND NOT TO BE DEPORTED.

100
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:44,903
>> Shannon: YOUR CRITICS HAVE

101
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:46,205
SAID, AND POLITIFACT CHECKED A

102
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:48,273
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU VOTED

103
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:49,508
FOR OR SUPPORTED WITH COMMENTS

104
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:50,909
ABOUT SOME KIND OF LEGAL PATH TO

105
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,413
EITHER CITIZENSHIP OR RESIDENCY,

106
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:55,848
LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENCY, GREEN

107
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,650
CARDS, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS,

108
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,651
FOR PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY.

109
00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:59,852
THEY CALL IT AMNESTY.

110
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:00,853
HAVE YOU EVOLVED ON THAT?

111
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,355
WOULD YOU SAY IT IS NOT AMNESTY

112
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:04,456
BY YOUR DEFINITION?

113
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:06,892
>> I'VE NEVER SUPPORTED AMNESTY.

114
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,861
I HAVE SUPPORTED FIXING THE

115
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,062
PROBLEM AND SECURING OUR

116
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:10,696
BORDERS.

117
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:11,664
I HOPE THAT WASHINGTON WILL

118
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:13,666
FINALLY, NOT THAT WE HAVE A

119
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,267
REPUBLICAN HOUSE, SENATE, AND

120
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,169
A PRESIDENT, BUILDING TO DO

121
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,637
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, I HOPE

122
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:21,240
THEY WILL BRING A FIX TO THIS

123
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,441
PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUING

124
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:23,842
OUR COUNTRY NOW FOR A LONG, LONG

125
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:24,243
TIME.

126
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:26,845
IN THE MEANTIME, THOUGH, I WANT

127
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:28,347
TO WAIT ON WASHINGTON, AND AS A

128
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:31,216
FOR GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA, WE PUT

129
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:34,019
OUT A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN, SECURE

130
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:34,453
FLORIDA FIRST.

131
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:37,222
THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN ENDORSED

132
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,124
BY SHERIFFS, AND THAT IS WHY I

133
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,460
HAVE BEEN ENDORSED BY

134
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,061
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE

135
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,762
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN FLORIDA

136
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:45,230
RECOGNIZES THAT MY PLAN AND

137
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,499
RECORD IS ONE THAT WILL KEEP

138
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:51,036
FLORIDIANS SAFE, AND AVOID THE

139
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,372
TYPE OF SANCTUARY CITIES AND

140
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:55,474
SANCTUARY STATES THAT HAD THE

141
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:57,042
MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA DOING A

142
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,278
DANCE AND IT IS EXACTLY WHAT

143
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:00,446
CALIFORNIA IS DOING AND

144
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:01,413
UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS WHAT ARE

145
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,415
SOME CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR

146
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,017
HERE IN FLORIDA WOULD LIKE TO

147
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:05,284
SEE.

148
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,820
THAT WON'T HAPPEN ON MY WATCH AS

149
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,353
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.

150
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:09,855
>> Shannon: AS YOU WELL KNOW,

151
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:11,890
FLORIDA'S A VERY DIVERSE ESTATE

152
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,859
WITH DIFFERENT INTERESTS, AND

153
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:14,493
OBLIGATIONS, AND DIFFERENT

154
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:15,327
POPULATIONS, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE

155
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:17,196
A LOT OF FOLKS TO APPEAL TO AND

156
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,697
TALK TO DURING THE PRIMARY

157
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:19,031
SEASON.

158
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:20,132
WE'LL WATCH IT AND BE DOWN THERE

159
00:04:20,132 --> 00:00:00,000
IN FLORIDA TO COVER SOME OF
