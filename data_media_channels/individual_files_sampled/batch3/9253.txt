EVERY CASE. Sean: JOINING US NOW WITH THE REACTION IS THE HOST OF CR T'S LEVINE TV, THE HOST RIGHT HERE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL, THE NUMBER ONE SHOW ON SUNDAY NIGHT BY FAR. WE CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE, MARK LIVE IN. LET ME THROW IT RIGHT TO YOU. I'VE BEEN DOING RADIO 30 YEARS, I'VE BEEN AT THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL SINCE OCTOBER 1996, IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS AWFUL AND IT'S BEEN BAD A LOT OF TIMES. A COUPLE THINGS HERE, FIRST OF ALL NOTICE THERE IS NO BLUE DRESS HERE. OUT OF THESE THREE ACCUSERS, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE EYE WITNESS. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE CORROBORATING WITNESS, NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE SO THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON. NO CASE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY DOES DEMOCRATIC THEY BELIEVE THAT ONLY THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. NO DUE PROCESS AND NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BECAUSE I HAVE TO MAKE THAT CASE. THE DEMOCRATS, THE LAWYERS AND OPERATIVES, THE SENATOR IS ALL SCHEMING IN THE SHADOWS, THEY COME UP WITH NOTHING TANGIBLE OR CONCRETE. THE REASON THEY BLOW THIS OFF AS A COURT OF LAW IS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW TOTALITARIANS THINK. YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT MAKE ACCUSATIONS, AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS. THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF WOMEN OUT THERE MANY OF THEM WATCHING YOUR SHOW. MY WIFE, MY MOTHER, MY DAUGHTER, MY STEPDAUGHTER, MY MOTHER-IN-LAW AND SO FORTH WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO FIND THIS ENTIRE SPECTACLE, IT'S A ROMAN COLOSSEUM AND THEY ARE THROWING THEM TO THE LINES. LIBERALS DON'T SPEAK TO WOMEN. DID BILL CLINTON SPEAK FOR ALL THE WOMEN HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED? I DON'T THINK SO. PEOPLE KEEP SAYING BRETT KAVANAUGH HAD SIX FBI BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. HOW MANY BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS DID MS. FORD HAVE? ZERO. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ACCUSERS? HOW MANY BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS DID THEY HAVE? ZERO. IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO ME THAT ALL THINGS LEFT-WING DEMOCRAT LAWYERS WHO REPRESENT THESE ACCUSERS, THEY KNOW WHERE THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT IS AND THEY HAVEN'T WALKED A SINGLE ONE OF THEIR CLIENTS INTO THAT COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHK COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHV COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHN COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHU COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGHH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICE TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CAVANAUGH. THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE FBI. IF YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS, DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND FILE YOUR COMPLAINTS THERE? AND I WILL TELL YOU YOU WHY BECAUSE THEN THE RULE OF LAW ACTUALLY KICKS IN. I'M STARTING TO WONDER ABOUT THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THEY ARE EITHER FILLED WITH PERVERTS OR TOTALITARIANS, IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER. THEY ARE GLEEFUL ANTS EXCITING AND SALIVATING ALL OVER THIS. IT'S A DISGUSTING SPECTACLE. AND, ANOTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION WHICH IS THIS, THIS LADY COMES FORWARD AND POLITICO REPORTS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE A WORD SHE SAYS. MICHAEL AVENATTI IS BACK, THE SLIP AND FALL LAWYER. THE DEMOCRATS EMBRACE HIM AND EMBRACE THE ARGUMENT. MS. RAMIREZ DID NOT WANT TO COME FORWARD. THE DEMOCRATS STAFF GOES AND FINDS HER AND DRAGS HER FORWARD, AND AND I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS DR. FORD ISSUE. SHE WANTED TO REMAIN PRIVATE SO WHERE DID SHE GO TO "THE WASHINGTON POST"? NOW HERE'S THE THING. I KEEP HEARING ALL OVER TELEVISION, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT DR. FORD HAS TO SAY. OF COURSE, WE ALL WANT TO HEAR WHAT DR. FORD HAS TO SAY. SHE HAS A PhD AND AN ALLEGATION AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. EXAMINATION C EXAMINATION O EXAMINATION S EXAMINATION E EXAMINATION A EXAMINATION I EXAMINATION E SHE NEEDS TO BE CROSSED EXAMINATION D AGGRESSIVELY. AND THE FOUR PEOPLE SHE MENTIONS SAY, THAT'S NOT TRUE. MS. FORD NEEDS TO BE QUESTIONED AND THOROUGHLY. AND I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, THIS ENTIRE PROCESS FROM BORK TO CLARENCE THOMAS, AND THE REST UP TO NOW, AS BEEN HIJACKED. LOOK AT THE DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE, IT'S THE MOST RADICAL BUNCH IMAGINABLE. YOU HAVE JILL BRAND, EINSTEIN, DURBIN, KAMALA HARRIS, BOOKER, ALL FROM DARK BLUE STATES. ONE PARTY STATES WHO ARE TRYING TO APPEAL THE MOST RADICAL CRAZIES IN THEIR PARTY. WE NEED TO STAND UP TO THIS. Sean: MARK 11, THANK YOU.
