Obviously you and I could talk
for hours about our differences
on Trump.
But that’s not why I want
to talk to today as you know.
In recent
days you’ve inaugurated
the phrase "Former Trumpers."
What are Former Trumpers and why
should he be terrified of them?
The Former Trumpers should keep
Donald Trump awake at night.
We’re the ones who didn’t care
about the Access Hollywood
tape.
He had absolute rock solid
locked us in on support
because we thought we
wouldn’t be betrayed.
Finally, finally, he could sell Ivanka Trump
merchandise from the Oval
Office if he would just
build the wall.
If he doesn’t have us anymore –
No, that’s what he should be
worried about because
you play those
people for suckers?
The one who stood by him through
thick and thin and thought this
was finally something different.
Finally, we have a politician
who’s not going to lie to us.
No, Former Trumpers should
put the fear of God in him.
One month into Donald
Trump’s presidency
you said so far I’d give him an
A plus.
What was...
One month in.
So far I give him an A plus.
Well, he’s turned in several
more papers at this point,
and there have been
some final exams and pop
quizzes. What’s his grade today?
We’re halfway through
the semester and he’s failing.
He could still get ahead.
There’s still a shot
for extra credit.
Let me guess: It
involves a wall?
Well, don’t act like I'm the nut
wanting a wall.
That was the chant
at every rally.
I didn't make this up.
But let’s be adults here.
Was Mexico ever going
to pay for it?
His voters absolutely
do not care.
He promised that as often
as he promised the wall.
I know.
But it was like me
giving him an A plus.
It was just a fun chant.
"And who’s going to pay for it?"
I promise you.
We want a wall.
We don’t care who pays for it.
So how much does
he have to worry
politically about Former Trumpers?
If he doesn't change course –
No, they’re never coming back.
Are you,
are you now a Former Trumper? Yes?
Look, he can still come back.
You are a temporary Former Trumper?
If he builds the wall.
He will be the emperor-god again.
You are a resurrected Trumper?
I'll throw a huge party.
He’ll be, I’ll
start a committee
to put him on Mount Rushmore.
But right now, if I
were a betting woman,
I don’t think we’re
getting a wall.
One of the things
that most stunned me
as his administration
came together
was he spent so much time during
the campaign railing against
Wall Street, fashioning
himself as a populist.
This was the richest cabinet,
I think,
-Yep, it was.
in history.
What’s driving me
crazy is every time
I hear somebody's leaving,
I get excited,
and then I find out who it’s
being replaced with.
To just, to kind of be a little bit
more complete and nuanced.
You said that, you
implied that Trump
was governing so that
Jared and Ivanka didn’t lose
their friends in the Hamptons.
You can’t hire your kids!
We don’t like nepotism.
We’re Americans.
This is third world behavior.
They’re perfectly nice people.
So the two of them
have no business
being in the advisory roles?
O.K., it was Jared’s
idea to fire Comey.
It was Jared’s idea to hire
Scaramucci.
At any point does it,
does it,
dawn on someone?
Now, every time I take
this guy’s advice
disaster ensues.
It doesn't seem to be hitting home.
Why? Because it’s a relative.
