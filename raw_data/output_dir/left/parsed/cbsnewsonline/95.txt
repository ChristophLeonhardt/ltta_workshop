WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR 
THIS IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE IT IS 
AVAILABLE ON A SECOND STREAMING 
WEBSITE. 
>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU RIGHT 
NOT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> OF THE REMAINS OF THE KOREAN 
WAR UNACCOUNTED FOR WAS A 
MANIFESTATION OF THE COMMITMENT 
SECURED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
PLEDGED BY CHAIRMAN KIM AT THE 
SINGAPORE SUMMIT. 
FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE 7700 
STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR FROM THE 
KOREAN WAR, THIS FIRST STEP IN 
FULFILLING THIS COMMITMENT HAS 
UNDOUBTEDLY PROVIDED A SCENE OF 
HOPE. LAST WEEK OVER 700 OF THE 
FAMILY MEMBERS GATHERED IN 
ARLINGTON VIRGINIA TO RECEIVE 
GOVERNMENT UPDATES AND THEY 
WERE RESOUNDINGLY APPRECIATIVE 
OF THE SUCCESSFUL ADVOCACY OF 
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
TO OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO 
ATTENDED CHARLES AND LARRY 
McDANIEL WERE THE RECIPIENTS OF 
THE DOG TAG THAT THEIR FATHER, 
CHARLES McDANIEL, OF INDIANA. 
IT WAS A PERSONAL EFFECT 
RETURNED BY THE NORTH KOREANS. 
THE REMAINS OF THE 55 CASES ARE 
WELL INTO THE PAINSTAKING 
MULTIFACETED ANALYSES BY DOCTOR 
JOHN BIRD AND HIS FORENSIC 
SCIENCE TEAM IN HAWAII AND IN 
THE COMING WEEKS DOCTOR TIM 
McMAHON AND HIS DEDICATED DNA 
SPECIALIST IN DELAWARE WILL 
BEGIN THEIR METICULOUS TESTING. 
THE SCIENTIST AND THE 
CAPABILITIES OF OUR LABS WILL 
BE CHALLENGED. 
IN THE MONTHS AND THE YEARS 
AHEAD THEY WILL MAKE 
IDENTIFICATION AND GIVE 
FAMILIES LONG-SOUGHT ANSWERS. 
WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THE ONE 
AUGUST REPATRIATION IS THE 
FIRST TANGIBLE ACTION OF OTHERS 
WITH WHICH WHICH WE CAN ACCOUNT 
FOR MORE MISSING FROM THE 
KOREAN WAR. 
THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE 
SINGAPORE COMMITMENT WAS THE 
RECOVERY OF REMAINS IN NORTH 
KOREA WHICH THE PRK OFFICIALS 
REAFFIRMED LAST MONTH. 
WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF 
EXPLORING NEXT STEPS AS WELL AS 
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE KOREAN 
PEOPLE'S ARMY FOR THE EXPRESS 
PURPOSE OF RESUMING JOINT FIELD 
OPERATIONS AND HAVING 
ADDITIONAL REPATRIATION'S. 
OUR MISSION TO SEARCH FOR, FIND 
AND ACCOUNT FOR MISSING 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PERSONNEL 
FROM WORLD WAR II THROUGH 
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM IS NOT 
LIMITED TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
TODAY 186 PERSONNEL FROM DPA AND
PRIVATE PARTNERS ARE DEPLOYED 
IN SEVEN NATIONS. 
YESTERDAY 50 OF THOSE MEMBERS 
RETURNED FROM LAOS AND THE 
PHILIPPINES. 
OUR GLOBAL MISSION IS 
HUMANITARIAN IN EVERY RESPECT. 
THE IMPACT OF A MISSING 
AMERICAN TO THEIR FAMILY IS NOT 
CONSTRAINED BY TIME OR 
GENERATIONS. IT LEAVES AN 
ENDURING PAIN AND VOID. 
THIS IS WHY FORMER ENEMIES LIKE 
VIETNAM USED COOPERATION ON THE 
POW MIA MISSION AS A BRIDGE TO 
NORMALIZATION AND TODAY'S 
DRIVING BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE UNITED STATES. 
THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA VIGOROUSLY PURSUES 
THE FULLEST POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING 
OF ARE MISSING REFLECTS OUR 
VALUES AS A NATION. 
THE SACRED OBLIGATION IF NOT 
MORAL IMPERATIVE REMAINS A HIGH 
PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE. 
INHERIT TO THE EXCEPTIONAL 
TEAMWORK, RESOURCES AND THE 
RESOLUTENESS PROVIDED BY 
MULTIPLE AGENCIES IS A SOLEMN 
VOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE SENT OFF 
IN HARMS WAY AND ARE MISSING 
WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. 
THEIR FAMILIES WILL RECEIVE 
ANSWERS TO THEIR DECADES OF 
UNCERTAINTY. 
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WELCOME 
YOUR QUESTIONS. 
>> PRESIDENT CLINTON IN 2000 
WENT TO A PLACE IN VIETNAM 
NORTH OF HANOI WHERE ONE OF 
THESE RECOVERY EFFORTS WERE 
UNDERWAY, EVEN THERE THINGS 
WERE DISCOVERED AND IT TAKES A 
LONG TIME TO JUST -- ESTABLISH 
THE FORENSIC TRAIL. 
WHAT CONDITIONS ARE THE REMAINS 
OR THE PARTS OF REMAINS? HOW 
CHALLENGING WILL THE FORENSIC 
WORK BE? ARE YOU A LONG WAYS 
AWAY OR WHAT YOU RECEIVED IS IS 
SOMETHINGTO GET YOU TO 
IDENTIFY AND CONFIRM? 
>> WE CHARACTERIZE THE 
PRESERVATION OF THE REMAINS AS 
MODERATE TO POOR AS A GENERAL 
CONSIDERATION. 
HOWEVER, WHAT OUR LAB IS 
SPECIALIZES IN IS MAKING 
IDENTIFICATION IN CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHERE YOU HAVE LITTLE TO WORK 
WITH. 
I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO DO WELL WITH THE 
REMAINS OF THE 55 BOXES OVER 
THE COMING MONTHS AND MAYBE THE 
NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS AT 
STAKE, WE WILL BE DOING A LOT 
OF DNA SAMPLING, THAT IS WHAT 
DOCTOR McMAHON'S LAB DOES IS 
THEY PROCESS SAMPLES AND THEN 
THEY GO INTO A MASSIVE DATABASE 
WHERE THEY CAN BE COMPARED TO 
THE OTHER SAMPLES THAT WE HAVE 
GENERATED FROM REMAINS FROM 
NORTH KOREA AND ALSO COMPARED 
TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS. 
IT TAKES TIME TO GET THE 
SAMPLES PROCESSED THROUGH THE 
LAB, IT TAKES TIME TO GET THEM 
INTO THE MASS COMPARISON. 
ONCE THEY ARE IN THERE, WE WILL 
START LOOKING FOR QUICK 
IDENTIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE 
MADE WHERE YOU HAVE COMPELLING 
MATCHES THAT SHOW THEMSELVES 
EARLY ON. 
WE ALSO LOOK FOR COMPARISONS TO 
DENTAL RECORDS THAT CAN BE 
DISTINCTIVE. 
WE LOOK FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT 
ARE UNUSUAL IN THE SENSE OF 
BEING VERY TALL, VERY SHORT, 
VERY OLD, ANYTHING THAT WILL 
DISTINGUISH SOMEBODY WE COULD 
GET A GOOD CLUE AND IDENTIFY 
THEM FASTER. 
BECAUSE OF THE PRESERVATION OF 
THE REMAINS, THAT WILL GUIDE 
THE METHODS THAT WE CAN BRING 
TO BEAR ON THE CASE. 
THE CASE WILL BE VERY DNA 
INTENSIVE IN TERMS OF THE WAY 
WE GO ABOUT THIS. 
>> WHAT DOES THAT NUMBER 
REPRESENT? 55 INDIVIDUALS? 
>> NO. 
IT IS THE NUMBER OF BOXES THAT 
THE REMAINS CAME IN. 
AT NO TIME DID WE EXPECT THERE 
TO BE ONE BODY, ONE BOX. 
NOR DID THEY TRY TO PITCH IT 
THAT WAY TO US. 
>> WHAT TYPE OF CERTAINTY DO 
YOU HAVE THAT THE REMAINS THAT 
THE NORTH KOREANS HANDED OVER 
ARE THAT OF MISSING AMERICANS 
AS OPPOSED TO OTHER 
NATIONALITIES THAT FOUGHT 
ALONGSIDE THE AMERICANS? 
>> WE HAVE A HIGH CONFIDENCE. 
IN THE EARLY 90s FOR FIVE 
YEARS, THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD 
REPATRIATE UNILATERALLY REMAINS 
THAT THEY RECOVERED. 
OUT OF THOSE 208 BOXES OVER 
FIVE YEARS, WE ESTIMATED AFTER 
DNA SAMPLING OF 400 INDIVIDUALS.
FROM THAT 200 WERE AMERICANS. 
THE LIKELIHOOD, YOU ARE 
CORRECT, THERE MAY BE SOME UN 
FORCES, THERE MAY BE SOME SOUTH 
KOREAN REMAINS AS WELL AS 
CHINESE AND NORTH KOREAN. 
OUR LABORATORIES BOTH DNA AND 
FORENSIC LABORATORY HAVE THE 
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CAPABILITIES 
BY WHICH TO DIFFERENTIATE THOSE 
REMAINS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
YEARS. 
>> I THINK YOU MENTIONED IN 
SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NORTH 
KOREA ABOUT POTENTIAL FUTURE 
ACTIONS MAY BE TO SEARCH FOR 
MORE REMAINS AND JOINT EFFORTS. 
IF I AM TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT, 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ENDED 
THE PROGRAM WHICH U. S. 
OFFICIALS WOULD BE HELPING TO 
SEARCH FOR REMAINS IN PART 
BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS OF 
THE FORCES. 
CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU ARE 
LOOKING FOR FROM THE NORTH THAT 
COULD RESUME THOSE OPERATIONS, 
JOINT OPERATIONS. 
AND HOW CLOSE ARE YOU TO AN 
AGREEMENT? 
>> WE OPERATED BETWEEN 1996 AND 
2005. 
OVERTIME WE CONDUCTED 33 JOINT 
ACTIVITIES WITH THE NORTH 
KOREANS. 
SECURITY IS PRIMARILY OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR 
PERSONNEL. 
WE ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO 
COMMUNICATIONS, HAVING 
COMMUNICATION ABILITIES AS WELL 
AS THE ABILITY TO MEDEVAC OUR 
PERSONNEL SHOULD THEY GET HURT. 
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR FROM 
THE NORTH KOREANS IS AGAIN, A 
COMMITMENT FROM THEM THAT 
COMMUNICATIONS, MEDICAL 
EVACUATION REQUIREMENTS CAN BE 
MET. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WE 
CAN CONDUCT THESE JOINT 
OPERATIONS IN A COLLABORATIVE 
WAY AS WE HAVE DONE FOR 10 
YEARS. 
IT ALL COMES DOWN BACK IN 2005 
THEIR BEHAVIOR ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE. 
THE PRESIDENT, RIGHTFULLY SO, 
WAS CONCERNED THAT THE NUCLEAR 
ACTIVITIES, MISSILE ACTIVITIES 
WERE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR 
JOINT OPERATIONS WHICH IS WHY 
WE SUSPENDED. 
>> IS THIS SPECIFICS ABOUT 
BEING IN THE FIELD THAT YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT? 
>> BOTH. 
SECRETARY POMPEO IN GETTINGTHE 
REAFFIRMATION FROM THE NORTH 
KOREANS LAST MONTH, AFFIRMED 
THAT THEY DO WANT TO ESTABLISH 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH US AND DO 
-- TO CONDUCT JOINT OPERATIONS. 
WE HAVE NOT STARTED THOSE 
NEGOTIATIONS BUT WE WILL DO SO. 
IT IS ON A SEPARATE TRACK. 
BUT IT COULD BE JOHN INTO THE 
GREATER GEOPOLITICAL STREAM. 
FOR NOW WE ARE TREATING IT AS A 
MILITARY, MILITARY CONTACT BUT 
MORE PARTLY AS A HUMANITARIAN 
ENDEAVOR THAT SUFFERED -- IS 
SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM ANY 
OTHER. 
THE 45 COUNTRIES THAT WE WORK 
WITH ALL RECOGNIZE THIS AS A 
HUMANITARIAN ENDEAVOR INCLUDING 
COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA AND CHINA 
WHERE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 
COOPERATION WITH THEM. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. GENTLEMEN, 
THE RECENT DEATH OF FORMER 
CONGRESSMAN BILL HENMAN OF 
NORTH CAROLINA BROUGHT BACK A 
LOT OF THE REHASHING SERIOUS 
CHARGES THAT HE MADE THAT THOSE 
WHO WERE IN VIETNAM EITHER AS 
PRISONERS OR DEAD WERE NOT 
FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR. 
HAS THE BOOK FINALLY BEEN CLOSED
ON THOSE AMERICANS WHO SERVED 
IN VIETNAM AND WERE PRISONERS 
OF WAR? 
>> IT HAS. 
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE CLOSE TO 
1700, 1600, THAT REMAIN MISSING 
AND UNACCOUNTED FOR. 
WITHIN THAT SET OF UNACCOUNTED 
FOR IS WHAT WE CALL LAST KNOWN 
ALIVE. 
IT IS A SMALL SUBSET OF 
INDIVIDUALS WHO, FOR WHATEVER 
REASON, WERE SEEN ALIVE AT A 
CERTAIN POINT DURING THE WAR AND
REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR. 
OUR PRIORITY WITH THE VIA MINIS 
IS TO GET AT THAT SMALL SUBSET. 
I THINK IT IS DOWN TO 25, NOT 
NECESSARILY PRISONERS OF WAR, 
LAST KNOWN ALIVE AT THE TIME 
THAT THEY WERE SEEN. 
>> REAL QUICK, OTHER REMAINS IN 
THE 55 BOXES, CAN WE CONFIRM 
THAT ALL OF THEM ARE HUMAN 
REMAINS? OR ARE WE QUESTIONING 
THAT? 
>> YES. WE DID A CURSORY 
INSPECTION OF THE REMAINS 
BEFORE WE LOADED THEM ONTO THE 
MILITARY AIRCRAFT JUST TO 
ENSURE THAT AT LEAST SOME OF 
WHAT WAS IN EACH BOX WAS HUMAN. 
WHEN WE GOT TO -- IN SOUTH 
KOREA WE SPENT TWO DAYS GOING 
THROUGH EVERY BOX IN DETAIL 
CONDUCTING WHAT WE CALLED A 
FIELD FORENSIC REVIEW. 
THE PURPOSE OF THAT REVIEW IS 
TO ENSURE THAT EVERY ITEM IS 
CONSISTENT WITH BEING HUMAN AND 
IF THERE WERE ANY ANIMAL 
REMAINS WE WOULD HAVE COMBED 
THEM OUT AT THAT POINT. 
AS IT WAS WE DID NOT FIND 
ANIMAL REMAINS. 
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW 
MANY PEOPLE WE ARE LOOKING AT? 
>> WE DO NOT. 
THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC PROCESS 
TO ESTIMATE THAT. 
I WISH IT WAS FAST BECAUSE I 
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD 
LIKE TO KNOW, FAMILIES WOULD 
LOVE TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION. 
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS GOING TO 
TAKE MONTHS OF ANALYSIS TO 
START TO GET A REFINED 
ESTIMATE. 
>> ONE LAST QUESTION. 
>>DO YOU HAVE A TIMELINE FOR -- 
AND CAN YOU CHARACTERIZE WHAT 
IT WAS LIKE TO WORK WITH THE 
NORTH KOREANS ON THIS PROCESS. 
HAVE THEY BEEN WORKING WITH YOU 
IN GOOD FAITH? 
>>THE FIRST QUESTION IS WE ARE 
IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING OUR 
NEXT STEPS, SO WE CANNOT SAY WE 
HAVE A TIMELINE TODAY FOR 
BRINGING BACK MORE REMAINS. 
WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE 
IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE. 
I WILL SAY IN TERMS OF HAVING 
WORKED THERE, I WORKED THERE 
DURING THE 1996, 2005, I SPENT 
A LOT OF TIME IN THE FIELD AND 
I WENT INTO -- WITH OUR TEAM ON 
JULY 27 AND THERE WAS A 
DIFFERENT FEEL TO IT. 
IT WAS A MUCH MORE FRIENDLY, 
WELCOMING APPROACH THIS TIME 
COMPARED TO THE WAY IT USED TO 
BE. 
>> THANK YOU, DIRECTOR. 
LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT WEEK, 
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WILL MEET 
WITH OFFICIALS IN ISRAEL AND 
UKRAINE AS WELL AS THE RUSSIA 
COUNTERPART IN GENEVA AS A 
FOLLOW-UP -- FOLLOW TO THE 
HELSINKI SUMMIT. LASTLY, WE 
XTEND OUR PRAYERS TO THE 
FAMILIES OF THOSE INJURED AND 
DECEASED AFTER THE TRAGIC 
BRIDGE COLLAPSE IN TO KNOW WHAT 
ITALY AS WELL AS THE VICTIMS 
FROM THE ATTACK IN LONDON. 
THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNS THIS 
ATTACK ON CIVILIANS AND STANDS 
READY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. 
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE 
PRESIDENT VIA TWITTER ABOUT 
OMAROSA DESCRIBING HER AS 
CRAZED, A LOWLIFE, A DOG. 
IS THIS A WAY FOR A PRESIDENT 
TO TALK ABOUT ANY AMERICAN THAT 
HE HIRED AND MADE THE HIGHEST 
RANKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN? 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS CERTAINLY 
VOICING HIS FRUSTRATION WITH 
THE FACT THAT THIS PERSON HAS 
SHOWN A COMPLETE LACK OF 
INTEGRITY, PICK -- PARTICULARLY 
HER ACTIONS HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
>>WHY DID HE HIRE HER? 
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO GIVE 
HER A CHANCE AND HE MADE CLEAR 
WHEN GENERAL KELLY CAME ON AND 
HE VOICED CONCERNS THAT THIS 
INDIVIDUAL DID NOT HAVE THE 
BEST INTEREST OF THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
COUNTRY AT HEART. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID DO WHAT YOU 
CAN TO GET ALONG AND IF YOU 
CANNOT HE GAVE HIM FULL 
AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT THE 
DECISION TO LET HIM GO. 
>>WHAT IS THE STRATEGY OF 
CONTINUING TO RESPOND TO THIS. 
WHY DOES HE NOT IGNORE IT? 
>> LOOK, I THINK IT IS 
FRUSTRATIONS. 
NOT ONLY THOSE OF US HERE IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE BUT FRANKLY 
MOST OF AMERICA WOULD BE HAPPY 
TO IGNORE IT. 
UNFORTUNATELY INDIVIDUALS IN 
THIS ROOM CONTINUE TO CREATE A 
LARGE PLATFORM FOR SOMEBODY 
THEY KNOW NOT TO HAVE A LOT OF 
CREDIBILITY AND SOMEONE THEY 
FRANKLY REFUSED TO GIVE A 
PLATFORM TO WHEN THEY WORKED 
HERE. 
IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS INDIVIDUAL 
STARTED TO NEGATIVELY ATTACK 
THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS 
ADMINISTRATION AND TRY TO TEAR 
THIS ENTIRE PLACE DOWN THAT SHE 
RECEIVED THE TYPE OF PLATFORM 
AND ROLLOUT THAT SHE IS GETTING.
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF 
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS 
ROOM AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN 
THE ADMINISTRATION NEVER HD TO 
TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN AND WE 
GOT TO FOCUS ON THE REAL 
POLICIES AND THE THINGS THAT 
MATTER NOT TO JUST PEOPLE IN 
THIS BUILDING BUT ALL 
AMERICANS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, 
HISPANICS, EVERYONE IN BETWEEN. 
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING TO 
DO FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CRITICS 
WHO SEE THE ATTACKS ON OMAROSA 
AS A PATTERN OF HIM ASSAULTING 
AFRICAN-AMERICANS -- HE HAS 
CLAIMED THAT FOOTBALL PLAYERS 
DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 
PROTESTING. 
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING TO 
DO WITH RACE. 
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE 
PRESIDENT CALLING OUT SOMEONE'S 
LACK OF INTEGRITY. 
THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD ONLY 
POINT A FEW THINGS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID NEGATIVE 
ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE 
MINORITIES, THE FACT IS THE 
PRESIDENT IS A EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY PERSON THAT CALLS 
THINGS LIKE HE SEES IT. 
HE FIGHTS FIRE WITH FIRE AND HE 
DOES NOT HOLD BACK. 
SAME HAVE YOU SIGNED --? 
>> I AM NOT GOING TO GO BACK 
AND FORTH ON WHO HAS SIGNED -- 
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
I CAN TELL YOU IT IS COMMON FOR 
EMPLOYEES TO SIGN, PARTICULARLY 
ANYONE WITH SECURITY CLEARANCE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE 
KEPT OMAROSA ON DESPITE 
COMPLAINTS FROM COLLEAGUES 
BECAUSE SHE PERSONALLY 
SUPPORTED HIM -- 
>>I CANNOT HEAR YOU. 
>>HE SAID HE KEPT HER ON 
BECAUSE HE PERSONALLY SUPPORTED 
-- SHE PERSONALLY SUPPORTED 
HIM. 
IS THAT TRUE OF ANY OTHER 
OFFICIALS --. 
>>I AM NOT AWARE OF THAT. 
>> SINCE YOU DO NOT WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT OMAROSA I HAVE SOME 
OTHER --. 
DO YOU KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT 
WOULD CALL A BAN ON PRODUCTS 
LIKE IPHONES? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE A POLICY 
ANNOUNCEMENT ON THAT FRONT. 
>>THERE WAS A REPORT FROM OUR 
COLLEAGUE THAT THE U. S. IS 
WARNING TURKEY OF INCREASE 
PRESSOR -- PRESSURE SO I WAS 
WANTING IF YOU HAD DETAILS ON 
WHAT STEPS MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND 
-- WOULD TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS. 
>>HOW THE INFORMATION FROM 
TURKEY WAS RECEIVED OR HAVE 
INFORMATION FROM THE UNITED 
STATES TO TURKEY? 
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 
TURKISH AMBASSADOR REQUEST, 
AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON MET WITH 
THE AMBASSADOR OF TURKEY 
YESTERDAY HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND HE CONTINUED TO RAISE 
AND POINT OUT THE CONCERNS THAT 
WE HAVE. 
>>ONE LAST ONE, DID THE 
PRESIDENT ENCOURAGE ISRAEL'S 
GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE A TURKISH 
CITIZEN IN JULY AND DID THAT 
CONTRIBUTE TO HIS FRUSTRATION 
WITH --? 
>> CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
A GREAT DEAL OF FRUSTRATION ON 
THE FACT THAT PASTOR BRUNSON 
HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED AS WELL 
IS THE FACT THAT OTHER U. S. 
CITIZENS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE --
DIPLOMATIC EMPLOYEES HAVE NOT 
BEEN RELEASED. 
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT OR THE 
WHITE HOUSE BELIEVE THAT IT IS 
A VIOLATION OF DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE IF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
INVESTIGATION GOES BEYOND 
SEPTEMBER 1? 
>> I AM NOT GOING TO SAY THAT. 
NOT NECESSARILY A SPECIFIC 
VIOLATION BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY 
CLEAR THAT NOT ONLY DO WE THINK 
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT 
THIS TO WRAP UP. 
>>TWO QUESTIONS ON TURKEY. AS 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT -- GROWS
--, MY QUESTION SIMPLY IS ARE 
WE GOING TO SEE THE RESTORATION 
OF THE READOUT ON CALLS BETWEEN 
THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER WORLD 
LEADERS. 
THAT WAS TERMINATED THE DAY 
AFTER THE PRESIDENT -- ELECTION 
AND ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT THE 
PRESIDENT MADE A CONGRATULATORY 
CALL TO THEM AND -- SINCE, WILL 
THAT BE RESTORED? 
>> WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED NOT 
JUST ON CALLS WITH TURKEY BUT 
OTHER HEAD OF STATE CALLS AS 
WELL. 
>>THE TALIBAN IN AFGHANISTAN 
HAS BEEN ON A SURPRISE OFFENSIVE
AND HAVE KILLED ABOUT 100 
AFGHAN SECURITY PERSONNEL AND A 
COUPLE DOZEN CIVILIANS. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS VISITING WITH 
THE 10th MOUNTAIN DIVISION 
YESTERDAY AND THEY SERVED IN 
AFGHANISTAN, THIS IS NEW 
OFFENSIVE -- IS HE STILL 
COMMITTED TO HIS STRATEGY THAT 
HE OUTLINED A YEAR AGO FOR 
AFGHANISTAN OR IS THIS NEW 
OFFENSIVE GIVING HIM THE IDEA 
THAT A DIFFERENT APPROACH MIGHT 
BE NEEDED? 
>> NO ANNOUNCEMENTS OR CHANGES 
IN POLICY FROM THE PRESIDENTS 
ROLLOUT.  SAME HAVE YOU ASKED 
THE PRESIDENT IF HE HAS EVER 
USED THE N-WORD ? 
>> THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY 
ADDRESS THAT VIA TWITTER. 
I CAN SAY I HAVE NEVER HEARD 
HIM USE THAT WORD. 
>>HAVE YOU ASKED HIM DIRECTLY? 
>> I DID NOT HAVE TO. 
HE ADJUSTED TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
>>WHY HAVE YOU NOT ASKED HIM 
DIRECTLY? 
>> THE PRESIDENT ANSWER THAT ON 
TWITTER EARLIER TODAY. 
>>CAN YOU STAND AT THE PODIUM 
AND GUARANTEE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL NEVER HERE 
DONALD TRUMP UTTER THE N-WORD ? 
>> I CANNOT GUARANTEE ANYTHING. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 
PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THIS 
QUESTION DIRECTLY. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAVE 
NEVER HEARD IT, I CAN ALSO TELL 
YOU IF MYSELF OR THE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE IN THIS BUILDING OR IN 
THIS COUNTRY EVERY SINGLE DAY 
DOING OUR BEST TO HELP PEOPLE 
ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND 
MAKE IT BETTER, IF AT ANY POINT 
WE FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
WHAT HIS CRITICS CLAIM HIM TO 
BE, WE WOULD NOT BE HERE. 
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS 
FIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS AND 
IS PUTTING POLICY IN PLACE. 
LOOK AT THE ECONOMY ALONE, THIS 
PRESIDENT SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE 
IN THE YEAR AND A HALF HE HAS 
BEEN HERE HAS CREATED 700,000 
NEW JOBS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. 
THAT IS 700,000 AFRICAN-
AMERICANS THAT ARE WORKING NOW 
THAT WERE NOT WORKING WHEN THIS 
PRESIDENT TOOK PLACE. 
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT AFTER 
EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE, EIGHT 
YEARS HE CREATED 195,000 JOBS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS FIRST 
YEAR AND A HALF HAS ALREADY 
TRIPLED WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA 
DID IN EIGHT YEARS AGO NOT ONLY 
DID HE DO THAT FOR AFRICAN-
AMERICANS BUT FOR HISPANICS. 
1.7 MILLION MORE HISPANICS ARE 
WORKING NOW. 
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO CARES 
ABOUT AMERICANS AND IS COMMITTED
TO HELPING THEM AND HE IS 
PUTTING POLICIES IN PLACE. 
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU CANNOT 
GUARANTEE IT. 
>> I HAVE NOT BEEN IN EVERY 
SINGLE ROOM. 
I CAN TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT 
HAS ADDRESS THIS DIRECTLY AND HE
ADDRESSED IT TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE 
FOCUS OF THE PRESIDENT IS, THAT 
IS HELPING ALL AMERICANS. 
CERTAINLY THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 
HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR DECADES
AND YOU ARE JUST NOW HEARING 
úS 
ACCUSATIONS AFTER THE FACT THAT 
HE IS THAT WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER 
THE WORLD. 
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE BECAME A 
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT THAT 
YOU START TO HEAR SOME OF THESE 
SALACIOUS AND RIDICULOUS CLAIMS.
CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
ACTIONS THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS 
TAKEN, CERTAINLY THE POLICIES 
THAT HE HAS ENACTED, YOU CAN 
SEE THE HEART OF WHO HE IS AND 
YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT HE HAS 
DONE AND THE TYPE OF PRESIDENT 
AND PERSON HE IS. 
>> JUST A VERY QUICK ONE ON 
SOMETHING THAT OMAROSA SAID 
TODAY, SHE CALLED THE PRESIDENT 
MENTALLY UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE. 
AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED WITH HER, 
HOW SURPRISED ARE YOU AT THE 
LEVEL OF HER ANIMUS TOWARD THIS 
PRESIDENT, TOWARD THIS WHITE 
HOUSE. 
>>CERTAINLY I THINK LIKE MOST 
PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH HER WE 
ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT SHE 
WOULD GO TO SUCH A SELF-
SERVING, SOMEBODY WHO BLATANTLY 
CLEAR -- CARES MORE ABOUT 
HERSELF THAN THE COUNTRY TO 
MAKE UP SOME OF THESE 
OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS AND 
ACCUSATIONS. 
LOOK, SHE WORKED HERE FOR A YEAR
AND SHE DID NOT HAVE ANY OF 
THESE THINGS TO SAY. 
IN FACT EVERYTHING SHE SAID WAS 
QUITE THE OPPOSITE. NOT JUST 
THE YEAR THAT SHE WORKED HERE 
BUT THE TIME THAT SHE SPENT ON 
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 
I THINK IT IS REALLY SAD WHAT 
SHE IS DOING. 
>>VERY QUICKLY I WANTED TO ASK 
YOU, WE READ EARLY THIS 
AFTERNOON THAT THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN HAS MADE AN úARBITRATI 
OMAROSA. I AM JUST CURIOUS AND 
I KNOW THERE ARE SEPARATE 
ENTITIES. 
IS THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERING 
PURSUING SOMETHING IN THE WAY 
OF POSSIBLE ACTION TOWARD 
OMAROSA? 
>> I CANNOT COMMENT ON ANY 
POTENTIAL ONGOING LEGAL MATTER. 
>> A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID ONE 
MOTIVE FOR OMAROSA WAS TO TEAR 
THIS ENTIRE PLACE DOWN. 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? 
DO YOU OR OTHERS HAVE CONCERNS 
THAT WHILE SHE WAS HERE THAT 
SHE TAPED OTHER CONVERSATIONS 
THAT COULD BE DAMAGING TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE OR -- THAT YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO KEEP QUIET. 
>> I THINK THE GREATEST CONCERN 
THAT WE HAVE IS THE LACK OF 
INTEGRITY. 
>> SHE PLAYED A TAPE RECORDING 
OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE 
PRESIDENT DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT 
THAT THAT WAS AUTHENTIC? 
>> I DON'T. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE 
WAS UNAWARE AND THAT 
CONVERSATION, WAS THAT A TRUE 
REPRESENTATION OF WHAT HE KNEW 
AT THE TIME OR WAS HE TRYING TO 
MAKE OMAROSA FEEL BETTER? 
>> AS I SAID MOMENTS AGO THE 
PRESIDENT HAD A DIRECT 
CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL KELLY 
AND ASKED HIM TO WORK THINGS 
OUT. 
IF THEY DIDN'T HE GAVE GENERAL 
KELLY THE FULL AUTHORITY TO 
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HIRING AND 
FIRING WITH RESPECT TO OMAROSA. 
>>HE KNEW HE APPROVED IT. 
>> ON THE TIMING I THINK HE 
KNEW IT WAS A POSSIBILITY, AS 
TO THE FACT WHETHER OR NOT 
GENERAL KELLY HAD CALLED THE 
PRESIDENT I DON'T THINK HE HAD 
AT THAT POINT. 
>> REPEATEDLY WE HAD HEARD THE 
PRESIDENT DECLARE THE SO-CALLED 
ISLAMIC STATE -- HAS BEEN 
PRACTICALLY VANQUISHED IN IRAQ 
AND IN SYRIA. 
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 
YESTERDAY, THE LEAD INSPECTOR 
GENERAL FOR THE OPERATION SAYS 
THAT THEIR FORCES ARE ESTIMATED 
TO BE BETWEEN ANYWHERE FROM 
28,600 AND -- FIGHTERS WHICH 
WOULD BE AT THE NUMBER THEY HAD 
AT THEIR PEAK. 
HAS ISIS BEEN VANQUISHED? 
>> CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT -- 
HAS BEEN PRACTICALLY DESTROYED. 
CERTAINLY THERE CONTINUES TO BE 
ISIS FIGHTERS AND THAT IS WHY 
WE CONTINUE TO TAKE ALL OF 
THOSE THREATS SERIOUSLY AND WE 
LOOK FOR WAYS EVERY DAY TO 
DEFEAT THEM AND TO PROTECT 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>> CAN I GO BACK TO THE RACE 
QUESTION AGAIN? 
I GET THAT YOU CAN CITE 
STATISTICS THAT MIGHT BE 
POSITIVE STATISTICS AND 
POLICIES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
DONE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND 
OTHER MINORITIES. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO 
LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF THE 
COMMENTS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
MADE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT AFRICAN-
AMERICANS AND WHO FEEL LIKE 
THEY ARE SINGLING THOSE FOLKS 
OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE? 
ARE THEY MISSING SOMETHING? ARE 
THEY DELUDING THEMSELVES? 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM? THERE 
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT 
THE PATTERN AND SAY YES, HE HAS 
SAID NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT A 
LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT THERE SEEMS 
TO BE A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF 
SINGLING OUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS 
AND COMMENTING IN PARTICULAR 
ABOUT THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND 
THEIR LACK THEREOF. 
>>I DO NOT THINK SO. 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 
 
OF INDIVIDUALS CERTAINLY THAT 
ARE NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR ANY 
OTHER MINORITY. I CAN SIMPLY 
TALK TO ABOUT THE POLICY AND 
THE PERSON THAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS. 
I THINK, AGAIN, IF THE PRESIDENT
IS WHO HIS CRITICS SAY HE IS HE 
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS 
FOR DECADES. 
HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD 
BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON ATTEND 
HIS WEDDING. 
A NUMBER HAVE BIG FOR HIS 
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. 
IF THEY -- HE WAS WHO THEY SAY 
HE IS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. 
I THINK IT IS CONVENIENT THAT 
ONCE THE PRESIDENT BECAME 
SOMEONE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, HE 
HAS SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 
THROUGH HIS ACTIONS AND 
POLICIES HE WANTS TO BE A 
PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS, HE 
WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING HE CAN 
TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER, NOT 
JUST FOR A CERTAIN GROUP OF 
PEOPLE BUT FOR EVERYBODY. 
I THINK HE HAS MADE A NUMBER OF 
COMMENTS ABOUT PLENTY OF PEOPLE 
AND TO TRY TO SINGLE THAT OUT 
TO ONE GROUP IS SILLY. 
I THINK THE COMPARISONS 
PROBABLY HAVE MORE NASTY THINGS 
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEBODY 
WHO IS GOING TO FIGHT FIRE WITH 
FIRE. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 
NEW AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNEW WHEN 
THEY VOTED FOR HIM AND THEY 
ELECTED HIM TO BE THE PRESIDENT.
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE HE HAS 
GOVERNED IN A WAY THAT HAS 
HELPED ALL AMERICANS. 
FRANKLY IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT 
WHO IS CREATING DIVISIONS, I 
THINK THE MEDIA HAS DONE MORE 
TO DIVIDE THIS COUNTRY FAR MORE 
THAN THE PRESIDENT EVER HAS 
ELEVATING PEOPLE LIKE THE 
AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK, BY 
FOCUSING ON SPARSELY ATTENDING 
A RALLY INSTEAD OF ALL OF THE 
POLICIES THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND THE 
PRESIDENT ARE ENACTING AND ARE 
HELPING NOT JUST THE ECONOMY 
BUT ON SCHOOL CHOICE AND PRISON 
REFORM THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO 
IS GOVERNING TO HELP ALL 
AMERICANS AND I THINK WE WILL 
BE BETTER OFF TO GIVE THAT MORE 
ATTENTION. 
>> CAN YOU EXPRESS HOW YOU FEEL 
ABOUT OMAROSA? -- DID SHE PULL 
HER OWN WEIGHT? WHAT SHE VIEWED 
AS UNTRUSTWORTHY? DID YOU TRUST 
HER? 
I AM TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF 
WHETHER YOUR VIEW OF HER HAS 
CHANGED WITH THE PUBLICATION OF 
THIS BOOK? 
>>I HAVE EXPRESSED 
DISAPPOINTMENT. 
I AM NOT GOING TO GET INTO BACK 
AND FORTH. I THINK THAT THE 
FOCUS NOT ONLY OF MY TIME HERE 
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS 
LOOKING FORWARD AND HOW WE CAN 
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT POLICIES 
THAT MATTER TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
>> WHEN THE FIRST TIME THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION INDICTED 
AMERICANS THIS ADMINISTRATION 
SANCTIONED THOSE, THE 12 THAT 
WAS RECENTLY INDICTED, THE 12 
RUSSIAN NATIONALS, THIS IS A 
MINISTRATION PLAN TO LEVEL 
SANCTIONS AGAINST THEM? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE ANY 
ANNOUNCEMENT ON THAT. 
>>YOU SAID YOU WOULD LIKE 
EVERYONE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT 
THIS SUBJECT INCLUDING THE 
ADMINISTRATION, ARE YOU SAYING 
YOU WOULD LIKE THE PRESIDENT TO 
STOP TWEETING ABOUT OMAROSA? 
>> I THINK IF THE MEDIA 
CONTINUES TO GIVE IT WALL-TO-
WALL COVERAGE, THE 
ADMINISTRATION WILL BE FORCED 
TO RESPOND. 
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER OFF 
FOR ALL OF US TO WALK AWAY AND 
FOCUS ON THINGS THAT MATTER. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT --. 
HOW MUCH DOES THIS HAVE TO DO 
WITH COUNTERING THE GROWING 
PRESENCE OF CHINA IN THE 
REGION? 
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF SHARED 
VALUES WITH THE COUNTRIES THAT 
HE HAS VISITED. 
WE WOULD ALWAYS LIKE TO BE THE 
PRIORITY PARTNER FOR THOSE 
COUNTRIES AND WE HOPE THAT 
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL 
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND WE WILL 
KEEP YOU POSTED. 
>>LAST QUESTION. 
>>THE CHUM CAMPAIGN 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE 
PURSUING ARBITRATION WITH 
OMAROSA NECESSITATES ATTENTION 
AND A MAJOR NATIONAL FOCUS. 
CAN I ASK ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF 
SIGNING NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS
. LET ME ASK YOU WHAT IT SAYS 
ABOUT THE EXPRESSIONS OF 
LOYALTY OR LACK THERE OF, 
PEOPLE WHO WORK BEHIND THAT 
WALL? 
WHY DO PEOPLE NEED TO BE 
CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED FOREVER 
AFTER AND NEVER SAY ANYTHING 
NEGATIVE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, 
ANY MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY, ANY 
--. 
WHY IS IT NECESSARY? 
>> IT IS COMMON. 
>> FOR CORPORATIONS PROTECTING 
CORPORATE 
>> DESPITE CONTRARY OPINION IT 
IS ACTUALLY VERY NORMAL AND 
EVERY ADMINISTRATION PRIOR TO 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 
HAD AN DAS SPECIFICALLY FOR 
ANYONE WHO HAD SECURITY 
CLEARANCE. 
>> RIGHT NOW WHAT THE CHUM 
CAMPAIGN IS DOING IS FORCING HER
TO DEFEND HERSELF AND 
POTENTIALLY DO DAMAGE. 
WHY IS THAT NECESSARY? 
>> THAT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE 
TO ASK THE CHUM CAMPAIGN. 
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I 
CAN ANSWER. 
>> WE WERE LISTENING TO WHITE 
HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS. 
SHE ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT OMAROSA MANIGAULT NEWMAN'S
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT LIFE INSIDE 
THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE SHE WAS 
ASKED IF SHE COULD GUARANTEE 
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 
EVER SAID THE N-WORD  OR IF A 
TAPE EXISTED WHERE HE IS SAYING 
THE N-WORD. 
SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT 
GUARANTEE THAT BUT SHE ANSWERED 
REPORTERS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF  ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE. 
SHE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE 
NDA , THE NONDISCLOSURE 
AGREEMENTS THAT THE MEMBERS OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE ARE EXPECTED TO 
SIGN. 
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CBS CHIEF 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MAJOR 
GARRETT WHO WAS AT THE BRIEFING 
AND HE COULD TELL US MORE. 
MAJOR, WE HEARD SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS EXPRESSING HIS FRUSTRATION 
WITH OMAROSA BY CALLING HER A 
DOG AND NOW SHE MAY BE FACING 
LEGAL ACTION FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
DOES THIS WHITE HOUSE VIEW THIS 
DRAMA OVER HER TELL ALL AS A 
DISTRACTION OR IS THERE REAL 
CONCERN THAT THIS COULD CAUSE 
MAJOR PROBLEMS? 
>> CLEARLY THERE IS CONCERN, 
CLEARLY THE CREATION OF TAPE 
RECORDINGS AND THE PUBLICATION 
IN THE BOOK OR MEDIA 
APPEARANCES AND THE SUGGESTION 
THAT SHE HAS MADE PUBLICLY THAT 
THERE ARE MORE TAPE RECORDINGS, 
SHE WILL WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY 
SHE WILL RELEASE, IT IS CLEARLY 
A TOPIC OF INTERNAL CONCERN 
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
I ASKED SARAH SANDERS ABOUT 
THAT DIRECTLY AND SHE KIND OF 
GLOSSED OVER THAT. 
I KNOW THAT IT IS AN ONGOING 
CONCERN. 
A COUPLE OF THINGS TO LAYOUT 
FOR THE AUDIENCE, THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAS TAKEN NO LEGAL ACTION 
AS OF YET. 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THE CHUM CAMPAIGN OR THE TRUMP 
ORGANIZATION, I AM TRIED TO 
FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE HAS, LET'S 
SAY FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT THE 
CHUM CAMPAIGN HAS SOUGHT AN 
ARBITRATION INTO INTERVENTION, 
THAT IS NOT FEDERAL OR STATE 
COURT, THAT IS ARBITRATION 
PANEL. 
AS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT I 
HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THOSE WHO ARE 
INVOLVED, THE AGREEMENT SIGNED 
WERE NOT NONDISCLOSURE 
AGREEMENTS THE WAY THAT THEY 
ARE COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR, THEY HAVE BEEN 
DESCRIBED TO ME AS A NON-
DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT. IF YOU 
LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU 
LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE 
YOU DO NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR THE 
REST OF YOUR LIFE ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT THE 
FAMILY OR YOUR TIME THERE. 
I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD BY THOSE 
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE 
DRAFTING OF THE NON-
DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS THAT 
THEY ARE NOT LEGALLY 
ENFORCEABLE. 
THEY ARE NOT. 
THE PRESIDENT WANTED SOMETHING 
DRAFTED AND WANTED PEOPLE TO 
SIGN IT TO CREATE AN INTERNAL 
OATH OF SOLIDARITY AND 
TRUSTWORTHINESS GOING FORWARD. 
THEY ARE NOT NONDISCLOSURE 
AGREEMENTS THE WAY THEY ARE 
COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE 
LEGAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR 
CIRCLES, NON-DISPARAGEMENT 
AGREEMENT AND THOSE WHO I SPOKE 
TO WHO ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
THE DRAFTING AND ASSIGNING, 
THEY ARE PROBABLY, THIS IS THE 
ADVICE THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVEN, 
NOT LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE. 
THAT LAYS DOWN SOME ASPECTS 
ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE 
WILL HAVE TODAY AND I SUSPECT 
FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS ABOUT 
WHAT HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN SIGNED 
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> I AM CERTAIN THIS WILL NOT 
BE THE LAST WE HEAR ABOUT THIS 
BECAUSE SOME POINTED OUT THAT 
THE PRESIDENT BEARS 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIRING 
SOMEONE WHO HE NOW DESCRIBES AS 
WACKY AND DERANGED AND BY THE 
WAY A DOG WHICH HE CLAIMS WAS 
NOT IN ANY WAY A RACIAL EPITHET.
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE A 
RESPONSE TO THE LANGUAGE THAT 
HE IS USING AND THE 
RESPONSIBILITY THAT THIS GIVES? 
>> ACCORDING TO SARAH SANDERS 
HE IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND 
SALTER HE WILL FIRE BACK AND 
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. 
I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT 
-- OMAROSA CALL THE PRESIDENT A 
DOG SHE CALLED HIM A RACIST AND 
-- AND YOU CAN PICK YOUR 
TERMINOLOGY AND DECIDE HOW 
INSULTING OR OFFENSIVE THOSE 
WORDS ARE. 
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID ON 
TWITTER YESTERDAY IT IS NOT 
PRESIDENTIAL TO DO THIS, THAT 
IS PUTTING IT MILDLY. 
THE PRESIDENT IS QUITE 
COMFORTABLE, AS A MATTER OF 
FACT, HE DELIGHTS IN BREAKING 
CONVENTION ABOUT WHAT IS OR IS 
NOT PRESIDENTIAL SPECIFICALLY 
ON TWITTER. 
AS TO WHY OMAROSA WAS HIRED I 
THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE IT 
CLEAR YESTERDAY, SHE SAID GREAT 
THINGS ABOUT ME. 
I KNEW AT THE TIME MANY PEOPLE 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE WERE 
FRUSTRATED WITH OMAROSA AND DID 
NOT THINK SHE BROUGHT ANYTHING 
TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF 
POLICY, MUNICATION OR 
LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY, YET SHE 
WAS HERE BECAUSE SHE HAD A LONG-
STANDING AND PRE-EXISTING 
FRIENDSHIP AND DIRECT ACCESS TO 
THE PRESIDENT. 
WHEN YOU ENJOY THAT KIND OF 
ACCESS AND THAT KIND OF HISTORY,
PARTICULARLY IN THE TRUMP WHITE 
HOUSE YOU GET TO STAY AROUND. 
MY QUESTION TO SARAH SANDERS WAS
, WAS THE PRESIDENT AWARE AND 
DID HE AND POWER CHIEF OF STAFF 
JOHN KELLY TO FIRE OMAROSA. 
HE IN FACT DID. 
I ASKED WHAT ABOUT THE 
CONVERSATION THAT OMAROSA HAS 
PLAYED FOR THE WORLD TO HEAR IT 
SOUNDS LIKE THE PRESIDENT WAS 
SURPRISED. 
WAS HE JUST MAKING HER FEEL 
BETTER? 
SARAH SANDERS SAID SOMETHING 
THAT ADDS A LITTLE CONTEXT OF 
THAT CONVERSATION, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS NOT AWARE OF IT 
AT THAT TIME AND AUTHORIZE 
KELLY TO FIRE HER BUT HE HAD 
NOT BEEN READ IN ON IT YET. 
THAT CONVERSATION CAN BE VIEWED 
WITH THAT SLIGHT ADDITION AND 
CONTEXT AND INFORMATION. 
>> A LITTLE EXTRA COLOR. 
MAJOR, I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE 
START OF THE BRIEFING. 
AT SOME POINT DEFENSE OFFICIALS 
GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE 
IDENTIFICATION OF KOREAN WAR 
REMAINS THAT WERE RECENTLY 
RETURNED TO THE U. S. WHAT DID 
WE LEARN ABOUT THOSE? 
>> A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS,
ALL OF THE REMAINS PROVIDED ARE 
IN FACT HUMAN. 
THEY DID FORENSIC TEST IN SOUTH 
KOREA AFTER GETTING OUT OF 
NORTH KOREA. 
THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY HUMAN 
REMAINS ARE INVOLVED. 
THEY SAID THEY ARE NOT IN THE 
MINDSET THAT IT IS ONE SET OF 
HUMAN REMAINS FOR EACH BOX. 
THERE ARE 55 BOXES THERE COULD 
BE MORE OR LESS. 
THEY ALSO DESCRIBED WHAT THEY 
RECEIVED AS BEING IN CONDITION 
OF MODERATE TO POOR. 
I THINK THEY WERE TELLING THE 
COUNTRY THERE WILL BE A GOOD 
LONG SPACE OF TIME THAT WILL BE 
NECESSARY TO DO THE FORENSIC 
ANALYSIS, DO DNA TESTING, MATCH 
THOSE WITH EXISTING DNA 
DATABASES AND FIND AND VERIFY 
COMMONALITIES TO CONFIRM WHO 
THESE PEOPLE ARE. THERE IS ALSO 
THE QUESTION OF ARE THEY ALL 
AMERICAN REMAINS? 
OF COURSE THE KOREAN WAR WAS 
FOUGHT UNER THE UNITED NATIONS
, MANY COUNTRIES PARTICIPATED, 
THE PRINCIPAL COMBATANTS WERE 
CHINESE, NORTH KOREAN, SOUTH 
KOREAN AND AMERICAN. 
THERE COULD BE OTHER 
NATIONALITIES INVOLVED. 
THAT IS OTHER FORENSIC WORK 
THAT NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED. 
THE OTHER THING THAT WE LEARNED 
IS THAT THEY ARE NOT AT A 
STANDSTILL BUT THEY HAVE A LONG 
PROCESS TO GO THROUGH FOR THE 
NEXT ROUND OF REMAINS TO LET U. 
S. PERSONNEL BACK INTO NORTH 
KOREA, TO SEARCH FOR OTHER 
REMAINS, THERE IS CONVERSATIONS 
ABOUT THAT. 
THEY DO NOT APPEAR AND 
CERTAINLY THE WORD SPOKEN HERE 
AT THE PODIUM DID NOT CONVEY 
THAT ANYTHING WILL BE ACHIEVED 
ON THOSE FRONTS IN THE NEAR-
TERM. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG, 
LONG PROCESS. 
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE 
GENTLEMAN UP HERE SAID THAT SO 
FAR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NORTH 
KOREANS HAS BEEN POSITIVE AND 
COLLEGIAL AND THEY ARE HOPEFUL 
THAT SPIRIT OF COOPERATION AND 
THE OBTAINING OF MORE PHYSICAL 
REMAINS CAN BE ACHIEVED. 
>> MAJOR GARRETT, THANK YOU. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
