Oh more oscar-nominated movies well if you like to line up one of these things is not like the other and then all of a sudden it is a lot like all the others but let's get into this horror comedy thrill ride that is get out and is it worth all the buzz I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood yeah that was made for four million dollars in grossed over two hundred and fifty million dollars worldwide this was by far the most successful movie as far as production budget to what it actually grossed I've seen in a while now this movie was directed by Jordan Peele and I do think that he should be nominated for Best Director those are my favorite aspects of this movie but since it was nominated for Best Picture let's see how that stacks up first as a movie I'm gonna give get out a 4 out of 5 now in the movie you follow Chris and his new girlfriend they end up going to her house to meet her family and the encounter goes from awkward to really uncomfortable to downright horrific however the cliche of oh my gosh my white parents are not gonna like my black boyfriend are somewhat pushed aside by the unique story and really interesting elements they add to it including comedy to help tell it now this movie is predictable in a few places I even knew the big twist about 30 minutes and however this is a really fun thrill ride and it was really unique in the way they told this story it's not just your basic horror film there were a lot of new elements they put into it as well as the directing choices are great now it is a horror films of course there's some cheesy jump scares but the overall tension and creepiness of this movie along with the comedic elements really makes it a fun ride I do like the fact they added this for a diversity of genre it's not just you know a list of dramas that you've never seen before and a couple like one or two epic movies that they throw in there for Best Picture to have a independent kind of quirky awkward horror comedy thrown in there it's really cool but this movie does not deserve to be nominated for the Oscar my critic review was a four out of five script Wiser's a few places where this movie really shines particularly Jordans creation of this world it's a very unique world he created as well as a few theatrical elements they threw in there and the situations are unlike many movies that I've seen but the dialogue is a bit underwhelming through some places and very on the nose as you go through the story the theatrical elements are great in this the music the way they intercut it between the scenes and how they complement every single moment of tension the movie are done very very well as well as the directing the transitions and the way they shot some of these things and then showing you what it'd be like in the person's mind is done extremely well by Jordan peeling deserves all the credit in the world for it very interesting story and one of my favorite parts the entire mood is a conversation between Chris and this kind of deranged handmaiden girl who's in his room she starts talking to him and the camera does not leave her she starts to breaking out crazy and they don't give you a moment to breathe they never cut away camera so you're just stuck on this girl you're just asking to seem to end or asking for it to cut away to his face or something and they leave you there to leave that tension that awkwardness and then that that just push right in front of your face it's fantastic how are they so intentionally just steered this movie into white people are racist America's oppressive all those kind of cliches which is to be expected for most you know oscar-nominated films but this movie really took the white racist people to a whole new level and though the racism element may have pushed it in to the Oscars I really think it heard it as a movie and I won't explain why by trying to play the racial element the entire movie it really gild the lily and foreshadows everything that's gonna happen as soon as you drive in with this couple and see the black help on the lawn and in the house you know exactly what's gonna go on here if you have seen the movie just think about this for a second if it had just been a typical looking cast just like a regular diverse cast or whatever it would have been so much more interesting to go through the story and realize that the help that maybe younger and better-looking or whatever are acting weird there's something else going on you can't quite put your finger on it and so every time the scenes move forward you're like oh my gosh what's going on what's going on instead of being like okay obviously all the black you'll have something wrong with them what are these old white people doing in them that would have made the tension this movie way more interesting in a much better film I think in general as a whole but it might not have been nominated for the Oscar because they completely played into the white America's racist card the entire time but the worst part to me is not just that the white people are racist on the contrary white people aren't just racist the reason for the horrors of this movie are because the black people around them are superior in every way and cooler I'm really not exaggerating this this is in the dialogue throughout the entire movie in this movie why people are literally selling black slaves on the block to be used to some meat vessel slave things to take advantage of their superior talents in golf in sex and athletics and even photography yes I am not kidding I wish I was yes they really do say this and they emphasize it throughout the movie even when they're describing what this procedure is of how they hijack these poor black people now this movie is obviously speaking out towards racism to the enth degree but it takes it even one step forward by even constantly saying that there's a black superiority as well and that's one of the main driving points of racism and for my faith in values I'm gonna give get out a 2 out of 5 now the Kris character actually has some really nice attributes to him he overcomes a horrific experience growing up in a really tough area his mother is shot and killed in a drive-by and he ends up picking himself up on his feet making something of himself and being becoming a very acclaimed and wonderful photographer he doesn't land back into the cycle of violence and depravity that had plagues from his family now I do think that is a wonderful attribute they added to the story that they could have left out so that really added to and I like that element of value to it but that's really about it now this movie was extremely entertaining and well done I like the way they pasted a lot of the elements the political elements I could really just I mean it was just so on the nose in your face I really didn't know what to do about it except try to hope for the next scene and of course it was still entertaining throughout it with the comedy suspense and Horrors you know it was really fun right and though it was extremely left-leaning it in your face it does deserve some acclaim and did very well at the box office because of it but unfortunately it really is one of the most agenda-driven movies I've seen in a long time I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me
