BEACH, FLORIDA, WHERE THEY NEED
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.
>> THE SCOPE OF THE DEVASTATION
OUT HERE REALLY IS STAGGERING.
SEARCH AND RESCUE, SEARCH AND
RECOVERY IS JOB ONE HERE.
THE PRELIMINARY SEARCH OF ALL
STRUCTURES WAS COMPLETED.
A SECONDARY SEARCH WAS
COMPLETED WHERE THEY LOOK FOR
VOID SPACES INSIDE THE DEBRIS
WHEN THEY BROUGHT OUT THE DOGS.
I HEAR FROM SCOTT DEAN THE
LEADER OF THE SEARCH AND
RECOVERY OUT HERE THEY'LL DO
ANOTHER SEARCH FROM A DIFFERENT
ANGLE.
THEY WENT NORTH TO SOUTH.
NOW THEY PUT AGENTS ON THE
BEACH AND WALK THEM FROM SOUTH
TO NORTH HOPING THE CHANGE IN
PERSPECTIVE WILL YIELD MORE
VOID SPACES WHERE PEOPLE MAY BE
TRAPPED.
THE NUMBER THEY'RE NOW WORKING
WITH IS 178 PEOPLE WHO ELECTED
TO OVERNIGHT HERE IN MEXICO
BEACH.
THAT'S DOWN FROM THE MAYOR'S
ESTIMATE OF 280.
OF THAT 178, 139 PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN LOCATED SAFE AND ALIVE.
LEAVING 39 PEOPLE UNACCOUNTED
FOR.
I'M TOLD THAT NUMBER WILL BE
DYNAMIC BECAUSE YOU HAVE A
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES
THAT ARE OUT ON THE JOB TRYING
TO NOT ONLY SEARCH THROUGH THE
DEBRIS OUT HERE BUT TRACK
PEOPLE DOWN BY PHONE.
JUST ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION
AND CHECK THEM OFF THE LIST.
THESE MULTIPLE AGENCIES HAVEN'T
SAT DOWN YET TODAY AND CHECKED
OFF THEIR NUMBERS AND
CONSOLIDATED THAT NUMBER.
WE'RE OPERATING WITH 39 PEOPLE
UNACCOUNTED FOR, THAT NUMBER
COULD CHANGE.
THAT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF
COMMUNICATIONS.
BAY COUNTY OFFICIALS WITH THE
PRESIDENT COMING HERE ARE
COMPLAINING.
THEY WANT THE PRESIDENT TO PUT
PRESSURE ON THE COMMUNICATION
COMPANIES SPECIFICALLY THEY
NAMED VERIZON.
BUT THEY ARE COMPLAINING PEOPLE
CANNOT COMMUNICATE.
THEY CAN'T GET THE MESSAGE OUT
TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHERE TO GET
AID.
LOVED ONES CAN'T CONTACT EACH
OTHER.
THAT CAUSES LOVED ONES TO GET
IN THE CAR AND HEAD FOR THESE
TROUBLED AREAS ADDING TO THE
CONGESTION WHICH IS SOMETHING
YOU'VE HEARD OFFICIALS SAY OVER
AND OVER AGAIN IF YOU'VE
EVACUATED, DON'T COME BACK.
THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ADD
