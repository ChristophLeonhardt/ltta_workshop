I'm sort of the--
the rock and roll white trash
section of this show here.
Tom Petty, the singer and
songwriter who connected
California rock to a
deep southern heritage,
died in Los Angeles.
He was 66.
He rose to fame with
the Heartbreakers,
the band he formed
in the mid-1970s.
With them and on his
own, he wrote pithy,
hardheaded songs that gave 1960s
roots a contemporary polish.
His voice was grainy, and he had
a Florida drawl that he never
hid.
His music was a staple of
rock radio through decades,
with hits like "Refugee," "Don't
Come Around Here No More,"
"Free Fallin'," "Into
the Great Wide Open,"
and "American Girl."
He sold millions of albums and
headlined arenas and festivals
well into 2017.
[MUSIC - TOM PETTY - "AMERICAN
 GIRL"] Well she was an American
girl.
In the late 1980s he joined
Bob Dylan, George Harrison,
Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne
to form the tongue in cheek
supergroup called The
Traveling Wilburys,
which released two
successful albums.

Everybody's got
somebody to lean on.
In 2014, Tom Petty and
the Heartbreakers released
their 13th studio album.
I'm really excited this time,
because I know I really got
something 
It was called "Hypnotic Eye,"
and it entered at number one
on the Billboard charts,
becoming the first chart-topper
in the band's 38-year history.
Regardless of fame, his
songs stayed down-to-earth,
with sturdy guitar riffs and
lyrics that spoke for underdogs
and outcasts.
[MUSIC - TOM PETTY - "I WON'T
 BACK DOWN"] I won't back down.
