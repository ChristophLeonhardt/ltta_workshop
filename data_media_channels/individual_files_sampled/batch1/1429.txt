the downpour from turbulent economic storms over Argentina couldn't stop these University students on Thursday night the students along with their professors braved the rain to march through Buenos Aires and express their outrage over budget cuts in education but I think I'm here to defend free and high quality public education salaries don't match the rate of inflation on top of a lower University budget the country is in a crisis because of the International Monetary Fund the International Monetary Fund has extended a fifty billion dollar bailout loan to Argentina when president Mauricio Macri asked for an early release of the IMF funds the peso tumbled to a new low against the dollar ending the day at nearly half the value it had on January the first with a dollar worth over 40 pesos we cannot buy teaching material supplies or tools inflation is exceeding 30 percent and we are earning less than we need to feed ourselves there are teachers who are living in poverty protesters say basic needs get more expensive every day utility rates have increased 1,500 percent and businesses are closing leaving more people jobless they blame President Macri for what they call an economic disaster economists say the government needs to stop foreign currency from leaving the country however the government has done the exact opposite they've totally deregulated markets sort of setting the grounds for this run on the dollar president Macri is trying to ease panic among investors he has promised to restore economic growth while cutting Argentina's budget deficit reducing inflation and making the 640 billion dollar economy more competitive no boss I thought but I think you have to give the government time the legacy of the previous government is very pronounced very complicated but not everyone agrees that more time and patience will save Argentina's economy from a total collapse Paul Chatterjee on al-jazeera
