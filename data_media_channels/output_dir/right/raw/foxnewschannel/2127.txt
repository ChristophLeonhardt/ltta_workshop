1
00:00:00,527 --> 00:00:01,061
CHINESE ABOUT THAT.

2
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:11,271
THERE WILL BE

3
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:14,574
CHINESE ABOUT THAT.
THERE WILL BE NEAR AND LONG-TERM

4
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:15,142
CONSEQUENCES.

5
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:15,876
HEATHER: THE PENTAGON CALLING ON

6
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:16,610
THE CHINESE DO INCIDENT DIVISION

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,277
INVESTIGATE THESE INCIDENTS.

8
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:17,978
HE RAN FIRING BACK AT DONALD

9
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:18,678
TRUMP'S THREAD TO PULL OUT OF

10
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:19,412
THE OBAMA ERA NUCLEAR AGREEMENT.

11
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:20,080
THE TOP DIPLOMAT IN TEHRAN

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,814
SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE WHITE

13
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:21,248
HOUSE, ONE WEEK BEFORE THE

14
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:26,119
DEADLINE TO RECERTIFY THE DEAL.

15
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,092
>> THE US HAS CONSISTENTLY

16
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:32,692
VIOLATED THE AGREEMENT,

17
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:33,393
ESPECIALLY BY BULLYING OTHERS

18
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:34,094
FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN.

19
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:36,029
WE NEED TO OUTSOURCE OUR

20
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,932
SECURITY, NOR WILL WE

21
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:44,738
RENEGOTIATE OR ADD ON TO A DEED

22
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:45,405
WE HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED.

23
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:55,282
HEATHER: WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

24
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:55,916
JOINING ME IS RYAN MORROW.

25
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:56,550
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

26
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,050
WE APPRECIATE IT.

27
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:57,651
NOT ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED.

28
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:58,285
IRAN NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

29
00:00:58,285 --> 00:00:59,352
THE US PULLING OUT AND SAYING

30
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:07,527
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY

31
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:07,827
GAMES.

32
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:08,361
>> WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

33
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,062
THE IRANIAN REGIME IS WHINING

34
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:09,362
AGAIN.

35
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,698
WHAT THEIR STRATEGY WAS, THEY

36
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:12,332
HOPE TO MAKE HUNDREDS OF

37
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:15,502
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM OIL

38
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:16,169
DEALS AND OTHER DEALS WITH

39
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:16,903
INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AROUND

40
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:21,107
THE WORLD AND THAT IS NOT GOING

41
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,108
TO HAPPEN BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH

42
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:28,148
THE DEAL DID HAPPEN YOU HAVE

43
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:28,882
DONALD TRUMP IN THERE NOW, MIKE

44
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:29,616
POMPEO AND BOLTON WHO HAVE THEIR

45
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:30,917
EYE ON STOPPING THE IRANIAN

46
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:31,651
NUCLEAR PROGRAM ALTOGETHER THE

47
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:35,222
STATE SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM

48
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:35,922
AND EVEN KILLING THE ISLAMIC

49
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:36,990
REVOLUTION ALTOGETHER SO IT IS

50
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,329
NOT THE FAULT OF THE UNITED

51
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:43,029
STATES THAT BUSINESSES DON'T

52
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:46,099
WANT TO ENTER CONTRACT WITH THE

53
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:51,805
LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF

54
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:52,172
TERRORISM.

55
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:52,906
BILL: HAVE THE UN, OUR EUROPEAN

56
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:53,573
ALLIES ALL SAYING, TELLING

57
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:54,140
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

58
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:00,981
ADMINISTRATION TO STAY IN THE

59
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:01,281
DEAL.

60
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,015
>> THEY ARE BUT ALSO SAYING THEY

61
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:03,016
WANT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL DEMANDS,

62
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:09,256
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT TO THE

63
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:09,689
CURRENT DEAL.

64
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:10,389
I DON'T THINK THERE'S AS MUCH

65
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,056
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE UNITED

66
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:14,094
STATES AND EUROPE AS IT APPEARS

67
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,397
AND BEHIND THE BLUSTER, YOU SEE

68
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:18,131
FEAR ON THE PART OF THE IRANIAN

69
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:18,832
REGIME ESPECIALLY WITH NORTH

70
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:22,636
KOREA, THEY KNOW A LOT OF THOSE

71
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:23,336
NUCLEAR SECRETS AND IF NORTH

72
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,004
KOREA IS RUNNING SCARED THE

73
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:31,244
IRANIAN REGIME SHOULD BE AS

74
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:31,544
WELL.

75
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:32,279
DIANE: NORTH KOREA WATCHING WHAT

76
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,013
IS HAPPENING WITH THE IRANI AND

77
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:33,713
DEAL AND HOW THAT IS HANDLED,

78
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:36,783
THEY WERE LISTENING TO BENJAMIN

79
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:45,158
NETANYAHU WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT

80
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:45,892
SPIES THAT WENT IN, BRINGING OUT

81
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:46,626
INFORMATION THAT CONFIRMED THEY

82
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,327
WERE NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON

83
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:47,694
THE DEAL.

84
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:51,564
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE

85
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:52,098
THINKING ABOUT THIS?

86
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,100
>> I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO

87
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,734
FIGURE OUT THE NEXT MOVE.

88
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:58,104
IF THEY DON'T TRY TO RENEGOTIATE

89
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:03,410
THE DEAL, AS ANGRY AS THEY ARE,

90
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,144
THEY COULD GET SANCTIONS AND ARE

91
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:04,811
VULNERABLE TO INTERNATIONAL

92
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,545
SANCTIONS EVEN IF PEOPLE TRY TO

93
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:06,780
BLAME TRUMP FOR WHATEVER

94
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,480
DIPLOMATIC CONFLICT ARISES OR

95
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,720
MAKE A MAD DASH TOWARDS NUCLEAR

96
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,421
WEAPONS WHICH WOULD BE A BAD

97
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,121
RESULT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY

98
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:15,855
HAVE TO REALIZE THE ISRAELIS AND

99
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,657
AMERICANS AND OTHERS PENETRATED

100
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:22,195
THE MOST COVETED SECRETS OF THE

101
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:22,862
IRANI AND REGIME AND SAY I

102
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,297
PROBABLY GOT A SPY BEHIND ME

103
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:29,836
WATCHING ME RIGHT NOW.

104
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,570
JOHN: THE TO LISTEN TO THEM THEY

105
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,137
ARE NOT BACKING DOWN.

106
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:37,277
THIS IS WHAT A TOP URANIAN

107
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,978
DIPLOMAT HAD TO SAY.

108
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:39,713
TO PUT IT IN REAL ESTATE TERMS,

109
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:40,447
WHEN YOU BUY HOUSE AND MOVE YOUR

110
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:41,348
FAMILY IN IT OR DEMOLISH IT TO

111
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:44,084
BUILD A SKYSCRAPER YOU CANNOT

112
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:51,658
COME BACK 20 YEARS LATER AND

113
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:52,225
RENEGOTIATE THE PRICE.

114
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:52,892
THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE NOT

115
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:53,626
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE TERMS

116
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,361
WHEN ISRAEL HAS PROOF THEY ARE

117
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:55,061
NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE

118
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:59,966
TERMS WHICH WAS SUSPECTED ALL

119
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:00,266
ALONG.

120
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:04,938
>> TYPICAL PROPAGANDA FROM THE

121
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:05,672
IRANI REGIME TO ENGAGE IN WITTY

122
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:07,140
BANTER BECAUSE THESE 1-LINERS

123
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,078
HAPPEN NOWADAYS.

124
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:12,812
THEY ARE BAD AT IT AND THAT IS

125
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:13,480
WHAT WORKED FOR THEM IN THE

126
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,716
PAST.

127
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:17,350
IT WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE.

128
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,051
THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

129
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:20,620
WHAT TO DO NOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN

130
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,323
EXPOSED AS WEAK CLOWNS WAS ALL

131
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:29,095
DO RESPECT -- THEY ARE A THREAT,

132
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:29,796
BUT LET'S NOT OVERESTIMATE IT

133
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:35,168
AND APPRECIATE OUR POSITION OF

134
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:35,535
STRENGTH.

135
00:04:35,535 --> 00:00:00,000
HEATHER: AS NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO
