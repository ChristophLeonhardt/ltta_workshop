a Georgia couple has lost custody of their 15 year old son after they made the decision to give their son marijuana to treat his seizures apparently their fifteen-year-old son David was suffering from seizures on a regular basis they had heard that people were using medicinal marijuana as a way to stop those seizures and so they were so desperate and so tired of prescription drugs that they decided to try it and his seizures stopped but unfortunately authorities found out about this and there were some significant consequences take a look Matthew and Susanna Brill say their fifteen-year-old son David went from having up to 10 seizures a day to being seizure free for 71 days after he began smoking marijuana have you ever had 71 days where he didn't have a seizure never currently medical marijuana is legal in 29 states and Washington DC 9 states and DC allow for legal recreational marijuana but Georgia has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country physicians are not allowed to prescribe marijuana for medical use and it is illegal to sell or possess it but the law does allow those with the state issued medical card to possess low THC oil the only way he could get a medical card would be a six year waiting list so the brillz say frustrated with traditional prescription medication they took matters into their own hands you're having to buy it illegally yes Matthew brill says he smoked the marijuana first to make sure it was okay before giving it to his stepson you guys got arrested yes you both go to jail for six days the brillz were charged with reckless conduct after someone alerted the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services on April 20th David was removed from the Brill's custody that day he had a seizure and had to be rushed to a hospital so this is pretty outrageous I mean when you consider that recreational marijuana is legalized in so many states at this point the idea that a couple would lose custody of their children and face criminal charges because they gave it to their child for a legitimate reason is outrageous but I don't know maybe maybe I'm being extremely you know know this system is extreme yeah so I mean the the last part of the report out of all the terrible parts in the store maybe the most terrible so they take the kid to a group home sixty miles from his parents the parents are in jail and then what's what happens he has a seizure because he has seizures let him in this case the marijuana is medicine let him take the goddamn medicine but no we are insane and and brutalize our own population and so our answer for you want to help your kid is we're gonna throw you in jail and I don't give a damn about your kid let him have seizures because my morality says you shouldn't smoke pot this is why you need the federal government to end the prohibition of marijuana it's it's nice to have a legalization on a state level but remember we still have states that are incredibly conservative unwilling to accept the science behind the medicinal value of marijuana and people are getting hurt as a result of that I mean I think the responsibility of the department the Division of Family and Children's Services should be to protect children and do the least harm to children and I can't imagine taking stripping him away from his parents if this has affected his health that seizure was so bad but he had to go to the emergency room and now he's in a group home sixty miles away from his family that cannot be the safest option for this kid compared to what they took him out of it just it just can't be it's not it doesn't seem logical right right and to Anna's point about I mean it's it's horrific and I want to get into that part as well but to Anna's point about it being prohibited on a federal level well our Attorney General is going to make it his his tenure to make sure that that happens and this is why in Colorado still they're banking issues if you get money from the from the medical marijuana recreational marijuana business and commerce so I think this is a difficult sort of fight that we're going to have to have on this level and secondly I so many mothers and fathers with children who and the children who are autistic who have tons of seizures and medical marijuana or recreational marijuana was the only way that they could put an end to it so this is a very familiar story this is not a one-off this happens all the time in cases of children with seizures and it's it's remarkable the extreme measures that we take in responding to it being jailing the parents and then ripping the kid from his home and adding more of more harm I think they said in here that the reason they didn't just use the THC oil is because it would have taken six months to get the lights in six years six years so essentially though they're arresting the parents and stripping the child away from them not necessarily because what they were doing was wrong but just because they didn't wait long it because they did it quicker like it's almost like this is okay it just takes six years to get it if you would have waited six years yeah we'll just what about me with you right right just let them have seizures ten times a day for six years and then maybe we'll let you have it this is what we do to our own citizens and then we call it freedom and one last thing Matthew the dad here it's his stepson and they asked him okay you know did you know you could go to prison he's like of course I knew that and he said I'm a father that did what it took to make sure my son was okay I just I want to I want to add something because I've actually witnessed my brother have a seizure it was one of the most frightening things I've ever seen so to witness that at least ten times a day of course he would have done that of course you would have done that right I bet you Jeff sessions would have done that as well yes definitely one of his children was suffering from that and he knew that would be the only option I'm sure he would do it but you know that's the thing with some right-wingers some that they are unable to put themselves in other people's shoes they don't understand things
