crowd of media appearances rudy guiliani today torched two years of donald trump's collusion denials muddying the waters to a near unrecognizable condition as he spirals deeper into incoherent scenarios about what the president did and didn't know about the Trump Tower meeting that meeting is now at the heart of the obstruction of justice investigation and it's perhaps also being investigated as part of a conspiracy to coordinate with a known American adversary here two of the president's closest allies and advisors debuting the new new line on Russian collusion not that it didn't happen as Donald Trump has insisted on a near-daily basis but that if it did it wouldn't really matter because well collusion isn't a crime collusion is not a crime and so the fact of the matter is that we're a long way away yet from having anything to talk about here I've been sitting here looking in the federal code trying to find collusion as a crime it's not collusion is not a crime it's right after conspiracy Giuliani also potentially creating more problems for the president by describing what sounds like a detail planning meeting one that took place two days before that meeting with the Russians money David added that there was a meeting two days before the meeting took place with Donald Jr Jared Manafort and two others gates and one more person and that's a real meeting you're saying that that's a real meeting on earth on it on another provable subject in which he would not participate this meeting that Cowen's talking about took place before the meeting with the Russian but the other thing that's contradicted is Cohen also now says but he says too much that two days before he was participated in a meeting with it roughly the same group of people but not the president definitely not the president in which they were talking about the strategy of the meeting with the Russians to be clear that was cleanup of a walk back of a clean up and to update you Giuliani later tried to walk back said clean up but questions about whether such a meeting took place remain our friend Matt Miller live tweeting Giuliani's blunder saying this quote a penny for Whitehouse so Emmitt floods thoughts as he watches Rudi incriminates the President on live television possibly with actual evidence of wrongdoing possibly with third hand gossip here to help us sift through the day's developments some of our favorite reporters and Friends White House bureau chief for The Washington Post bill Rucker former assistant director at the FBI for counterintelligence Frank fit glue Z in New York with us today NBC News foreign correspondent Keir Simmons and Jennifer Rubin an opinion writer with the Washington Post let me start with you Frank for Glu Z because I understand the talking point is now that collusion is a crime but to be clear Bob Muller isn't investigating non criminal collusion he's looking for crimes he's very much looking for crime and in fact if you look in my dictionary which I just did for the definition of collusion it says illegal cooperation or conspiracy so really we should stop using the phrase collision and just say criminal conspiracy there's a host of criminal charges that could come into play here if it's proven that there was so-called collision what are those charges look if it's proven that Russian money was flowing into the campaign you've got election and campaign contribution violations you have violations of the emoluments clause if they were masking the origin of the Russian money then you you could have bank fraud and wire fraud and money laundering and there's conspiracy and there's a cop accessory after the fact if depending on when they knew what was happening and and here's a key on the hacking if indeed they can show that campaign officials gave a green light or knew or encouraged the hacking into the DNC then you've got the same violations the cyber crime the Computer Fraud and Abuse charges that we saw lobbed onto the Russian hackers you see conspiracy charges against the president or his campaign officials so it is about crime and Phil Rucker there must be at some level some awareness that liability or exposure around one or more of those crimes is at least possible as an explanation for their evolving defense put together how they keep moving the goalposts let's watch and talk about it on the other side are there any ties between mister Trump you or your campaign and Putin in his regime know if there are not that's absurd and there's no basis to it I have nothing to do with Russia to the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with this an acquaintance mm-hmm you know send me this email as a courtesy to him I said okay what to meet there's been no collusion no collusion there was no collusion at all I'm not even if that's a crime polluting about Russians excuse in the defense is often well he didn't obstruct justice he did it all on Twitter we now know Bob Muller is examining his tweets in his public statements the other defense for a long time was collusion isn't a crime we now heard from faint Frankfurt Glu's II that there are obvious and clear crimes under collusion around conspiracy the White House at some level has either intuited this and shifted their defense or they're simply moving the goalposts for their hardcore supporters which do you think it is well first of all what Rudy Giuliani is out there saying is not at all coordinated with the White House I think the White House would prefer that he keep quiet and and be a lawyer who writes memos and Till's with with paper instead of going on television all the time but what we've seen what you just played in that clip is that the president's you know legal defense all along has really just been a PR strategy it's been all about messaging undermining Moeller trying to to convince his supporters and anyone else who's listening that he's done nothing wrong without really delving into the nuances in the details of what the actual law is what the actual circumstances that are under review might be and offering this sort of blanket no collusion no collusion defense that the president's been making all the time including this weekend on Twitter and here you cover the Trump Tower meeting you cover the Russians who were in that meeting and you interviewed Natalia vessel and skya it is clear now from from your reporting in others that they are tied to the Russian government that this was a setup and either they were unwitting yeah or winning and it seems to me that that the goalposts have shifted as the evidence has become clear even to general public the ties to the Russian government are indisputable because Russian oligarchs billionaires are like that with the Russian government it's not like in America we're really rich people have to disclose their donations I mean there are no lines between I've seen them mixing together again in a game that you know Aris a gala Rove the Trump of Russia they call him the guy who was looking at building a Trump Tower in Moscow helped organize the Miss Universe competition in my Instagram feed just in the past few days take a look at this picture we found a picture here that's ours a gala of standing next to dmitry peskov in the last past few days it looks like they're on vacation together dmitry peskov is president putin spokesman he is so close to this is this is not hidden this is hiding in plain sight these are all part of the same Russian establishment and Donald Trump's ties these individuals are hiding in plain sight as well we know that his his son wrote back in an email I love it when you just offer dirt from this gang on Hillary Clinton I like to think of it as that these are obscenely rich people talking to other obscenely rich people I mean that's who the Trump's are that's who the gala robes are frankly that's who the Russian leadership are they have a lot of money even though it's is hidden away and they kind of behave the way you would expect obscenely rich people to behave they they want to talk to each other they don't see any reason they're not building communication lines they have children who they empower who often entitled they treat many many people like pawns these are people who are behaving in incredibly human ways I mean for the Russians this is about trying to figure out how to make more money let's get rid of sanctions why because we want to make more money let's get into the US economy because we want to make more money politics is part of that and of course that is the way the president thinks and many people support him for that reason frankly bluesy enter Bob Muller who has now charged 13 Russian officials for meddling in our election now weather is is I don't think that anyone is putting their money on Donald Trump actually asking Vladimir Putin to extradite those Russian officials in fact they have a plan to jointly investigate Americans and Russians that was trotted out in Helsinki but does that change the equation for Donald Trump who does not exist in this world that care describes where Russian oligarchs intermingle at the highest levels of the Russian government you know it's it's important here to make a distinction between really rich people in the United States and really rich people in Russia and and from what the world that I come from Nicole it's about the Nexus to the intelligence services and the government you're you're allowed to become rich in Russia you you are inexorably linked to the hierarchy of government and if you look at the people who were charged in the first Russian indictments that Muller issued in the social media propaganda initiative you can see the connections directly to Putin through the oligarchs and that money being used to stage and set up the operation right and and the plausible deniability that exists that allows Putin ago hey those were some rich people doing some political thing that's not our intelligence service that's horse manure the linkage is well established between oligarchs and the government and the intelligence services and that's important for us to remember and and we and we came in this way jennipher today because there's always a cause and effect as unhinged and deranged as the Twitter feed of the president United States somehow appears there may be a link between what we've been talking about and the tweets which are the harshest we've seen yet against robert muller reappeared and tweeting that robert muller is conflicted because he was turned down for the job of FBI director for which here it is this robert Millar ever gonna release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump speaking about himself in the third person raising a different category of questions including the fact that we had a very nasty and contentious business relationship I turned him down to head the FBI one day before the appointment of special counsel and Comey is his close friend I understand from sources that he and Comey are not particularly close friends and he was in there interviewing to be FBI director but I don't understand it to be Donald Trump who turned him down I think the other conflict that the president's talking about is some altercation about a golf club we also know though that the president wanted to fire Muller and it was John McCain the White House Counsel who threatened to quit if he did that and that and that Muller is looking at the decision to fire the special counsel running the investigation into him as part of the obstruction of justice pick the criminal intent so I heard you say on on Friday that these questions go to the heart of his legitimacy as president I that's what he's been afraid of all along that people would look at the Russia connection and conclude gosh this guy didn't win on his own he won because his buddy is in Moscow hacked the DNC released them at a very opportune time maybe he did a bunch of social media stuff and you know what he's right Americans don't like their elections being interfered with and if there was substantial connection and we're seeing more and more connections then yes his greatest fear is going to come true the other thing that's so remarkable about this is what did we learn Muller is looking his tweets and what does he do he tweets tweets threats to the special prosecutor tweets about lying to get rid of the Attorney General because he wouldn't do his bidding on recusal the interaction of the tweets the actions and the behavior of his surrogates and his allies it's something that Muller is putting together in the mother of all timelines and you're gonna see I think at the end of this a compilation of every comment he Trump was saying publicly what he was saying privately the most sending thing that I found is on the day that Donald Trump jr. gets that email um do you want to come and find some dirt on Hillary Clinton and he involves back I love it Trump goes out and makes a speech about seven hours later saying promises I'm gonna have a speech on Hillary Clinton you're gonna get all the dirt you can see how the network works back and forth and those emails and those tweets are going to be the corroborating evidence people say well you know Michael Cohen could be making things up you could be lying you know what there's gonna be a lot of corroboration because of the president's own words his own tweets the behavior of all the people around him and we haven't even gotten to flipping a Paul Manafort yet hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click
