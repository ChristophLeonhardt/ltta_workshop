1recent representation well a few years ago was Julian Assange right um this was i believe it was back when he was first arrested in the UK i went to visit him in England when he was still free on bail met him and his lawyers office he was not yet seeking asylum but we were obviously worried primarily about what would happen if you were extradited to the United States to stand trial here and I took the case because for me it was like the Pentagon Papers case Assange was the New York Times in the Washington Post the person who gave him the information was like Daniel Ellsberg or a Snowden I think you have to make a sharp distinction between the thief who engaged in civil disobedience you may support that thief but they have committed a crime and the publisher Assange the New York Times The Washington Post they've committed no crime they've acted consistent with the First Amendment to publish material that was given to them it seems the US government ultimately took that position too well we don't know we don't know we don't know whether there is a sealed indictment we don't know whether there's a subpoena against them we don't know whether he could safely come to the United States these are all unknowns what have you made of his more recent activity I haven't liked it I have not liked it I have to tell you not withstanding the fact that I represented him I don't think that Assad should be interfering with an American election and it seems to me he's in a very one-sided way trying to hurt Hillary Clinton that hurts his credibility hurts the credibility of WikiLeaks and it should not be permissible to interfere I don't mean legally I mean morally permissible did interfere with an American election do you do you think that he is in some way an agent of the Russian government no I don't believe that uh first of all be very difficult to that to be arranged I mean there is it in an embassy I don't believe that I think he's an independent guy I think he has strong views about things but I think he's acting in what he thinks is in the best interest of WikiLeaks I just disagree with him
