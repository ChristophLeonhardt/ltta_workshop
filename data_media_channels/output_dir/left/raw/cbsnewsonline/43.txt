141
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,949

THEY'RE MAKING THEIR WAY 

149
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,225
TOWARDS THE CAPITOL. 

150
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,226
VLAD YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TWO 

151
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,762
DAYS OF THE HEARING FOR BRETT 

152
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,899
KAVANAUGH, THERE WERE 

153
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,933
PROTESTORS ACTUALLY IN THE 

154
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,133
ROOM. 

155
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:54,567
REALLY DISTURBING. 

156
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,569
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SOMEBODY 

157
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,171
HAD TO YELL OUT AND HAVE TO BE 

158
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,672
REMOVED FROM THE ROOM. 

159
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,107
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS TIME 

160
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:01,674
AROUND THE PROTESTORS ARE 

161
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,443
ACTUALLY BEGINNING TO GET IN 

162
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:03,710
THE ROOM. 

163
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,979
>> IF THEY DO IT WOULD BE 

164
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,679
DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT'S HAPPENING 

165
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,314
HERE BECAUSE IT WOULD DISTRACT 

166
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,515
FROM THE REAL SERIOUS 

167
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,950
ALLEGATIONS THAT CHRISTINE 

168
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,417
BLASEY FORD HAS MADE. 

169
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,021
AND IT WILL DETRACT FROM BRETT 

170
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,255
KAVANAUGH'S PROTESTATIONS HE 

171
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,557
DIDN'T DO THEM. 

172
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,926
ALSO JUST SORT OF DIMINISH WHAT 

173
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,326
WE'RE WITNESSING. 

174
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,228
SO I REALLY DO HOPE AND THIS IS 

175
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,463
JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION,I 

176
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,864
HOPE THEY DON'T DISTURB THE 

177
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,197
PROCEEDINGS. 

178
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,399
IT'S GREAT TO PROTEST OUT HERE 

179
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,300
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU FEEL 

180
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,068
INCLINED TO DO BUT IN THE 

181
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,470
PROCEEDINGS, I THINK BECAUSE 

182
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,604
SHE'S ALREADY NOT USED TO THIS, 

183
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,539
AND SHE'S PUT IN HER OPENING 

184
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,174
TESTIMONY THAT SHE'S AFRAID TO 

185
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:35,674
BE HERE, HAVING THESE 

186
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:36,509
DISRUPTIONS I THINK WOULD BE 

187
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,710
JUST NOT A GOOD THING. 

188
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,414
>> I THINK THIS IS A GOOD RE 

189
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,583
MINDER OF IS THAT WHILE THE 

190
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,451
SENATORS WILL BE LISTENING TO 

191
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,051
THE TESTIMONY, AND PRESUMABLY 

192
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:47,487
MAKING A DECISION ON HOW 

193
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,788
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE, THE REST 

194
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,324
OF THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING AS 

195
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:51,557
WELL. 

196
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,859
AND YEAH, THEY'RE NOT CHOOSING 

197
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,426
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 

198
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,660
BUT YOU KNOW IN A COUPLE OF 

199
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,929
MONTHS THEY'LL BE HEADING TO 

200
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,397
THE POLLS TO CHOOSE WHO THEIR 

201
00:04:58,397 --> 00:04:59,365
REPRESENTATIVE IS AND THEY'RE 

202
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,634
GOING TO BE WATCHING HOW THE 

203
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,434
REPUBLICANS PERFORM HERE. 

204
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,303
SO JOINING US NOW IS REPUBLICAN 

205
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,104
STRATEGIST AND CBS NEWS 

206
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,305
CONTRIBUTOR LESLIE SANCHEZ TO 

207
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:09,275
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE 

208
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:09,675
CAN EXPECT TODAY. 

209
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,511
AND TO THAT, HE HAS SEE, THE 

210
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,579
REPUBLICAN -- LESLIE, THE 

211
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,148
REPUBLICANS HAVE BROUGHT IN 

212
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:15,548
RACHEL MITCHELL. 

213
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,919
SHE IS A SEASONED SEX CRIMES 

214
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,219
PROSECUTOR. 

215
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,188
THE LAWMAKERS, THE OLDER MEN, 

216
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,189
THEY WON'T BE GRILLING THE 

217
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,525
ACCUSER HERE OR BRETT KAVANAUGH 

218
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,926
BUT RACHEL MITCHELL WILL. 

219
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,661
WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR? 

220
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,562
BECAUSE THE FEELING IS THAT 

221
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,298
THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT THE 

222
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,232
OPTICS BUT DO YOU THINK 

223
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,467
SUBSTITUTING THEM FOR A WOMAN 

224
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,934
IS GOING REMEDY THAT PROBLEM? 

225
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:36,969
>> I THINK FOR SOME PEOPLE 

226
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,904
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE 

227
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:39,204
SATISFIED. 

228
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:43,376
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THIS IS 

229
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:43,976
OUT OF PRECEDENCE AND NOT THE 

230
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,278
WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE BUT 

231
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,547
CLEARLY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 

232
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,181
LEARNED A LESSON FROM CERTAINLY 

233
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,115
CLARENCE THOMAS AND HOW IT 

234
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,451
LOOKS AND PERCEIVED AND SHOULD 

235
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,185
THE NOMINATION MOVE FORWARD AND 

236
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:53,652
GET AFFIRMATIVE VOTE. 

237
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,554
THIS IS GOING TO BE PIVOTAL IN 

238
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:55,754
THAT. 

239
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,290
IN TERMS OF THE AMERICAN 

240
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,292
PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO ACCEPT THAT 

241
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,127
IT WAS A FAIR PROCESS FOR 

242
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,594
CERTAINLY DR. FORD AND FOR THE 

243
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:03,029
JUDGE. 

244
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,099
SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT IS 

245
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,400
THE FAIREST WAY TO DEPOLITICIZE 

246
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,135
EXACTLY WHAT VLAD WAS TALKING 

247
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:09,368
ABOUT. 

248
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,637
YOU SEE ALL THE PROTESTORS, 

249
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,438
IT'S VERY HEIGHTENED POLITICAL 

250
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:12,671
SENSE. 

251
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,073
AND THE THING WE HAVE TO KEEP 

252
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,609
IN MIND IS THAT IT'S VERY 

253
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,410
FLUID. 

254
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,144
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SENTIMENTS. 

255
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,047
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE 

256
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:21,781
ALREADY DECIDED THAT THEY'RE 

257
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,415
CONVINCED AND THEY BELIEVE DR. 

258
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,518
FORD, ALL DUE RESPECT TO THEM 

259
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,151
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FLUIDITY 

260
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,153
AND EVEN YESTERDAY, THE 

261
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,354
PRESIDENT WAS MOVING BACK AND 

262
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,523
FORTH IN TERMS OF HOW HE -- HOW 

263
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,758
SOLID HE WAS IN TERMS OF 

264
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:33,392
SUPPORT OR BEING OPEN-MINDED. 

265
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,594
AND IF YOU LOOK AT JUST -- I 

266
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,730
WAS GOING TO SAY VLAD, THERE'S 

267
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,966
A NEW MORNING CONSULT POLITICAL 

268
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,567
REPORT SURVEY I'M SORRY, THAT 

269
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,167
SHOWS THAT REPUBLICAN WOMEN 

270
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,636
HAVE LOST SUPPORT FOR BRETT 

271
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,205
KAVANAUGH BY 11 POINTS, SO 

272
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,406
THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEGATIVE 

273
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,342
EFFECT THAT ALL THIS IS HAVING 

274
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:49,642
ON HIM. 

275
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,010
>> ANNE MARIE MENTIONED THERE 

276
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,779
ARE SOME LESSONS THAT HAVE 

277
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,647
HOPEFULLY BEEN LEARNED FROM THE 

278
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,248
1991 CLARENCE THOMAS AND HILL 

279
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:56,515
HEARINGS. 

280
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:59,519
BUT I WONDER, BECAUSE AS I OVER 

281
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,920
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, HAVE 

282
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,455
LISTENED TO SENATOR GRAHAM TO 

283
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,991
SENATOR JOHN CORNYN, TO SENATOR 

284
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,726
ORRIN HATCH WHO LET'S REMEMBER 

285
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,661
WAS VERY, VERY TOUGH AND 

286
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,596
ULTIMATELY CRITICIZED FOR THE 

287
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,832
WAY THAT HE WENT AFTER ANITA 

288
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,466
HILL DURING THE 1991 HEARING, 

289
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,834
THEY WAS THERE ON THE SENATE 

290
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,469
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AT THE 

291
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,769
TIME. 

292
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,238
AS I HAVE LISTENED TO THEM. 

293
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:19,772
THEIR AGGRESSION TOWARDS 

294
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,474
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD HAS 

295
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,009
BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE 

296
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:23,742
VOCIFEROUS AND MORE VOCAL. 

297
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:24,844
JOHN CORNYN TO HIS CREDIT HAS 

298
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,379
SAID LOOK, WE NEED TO HEAR FROM 

299
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:26,579
HER. 

300
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,780
I WANT TO TREAT HER WITH THE 

301
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,851
SAME RESPECT THAT I WOULD MY 

302
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,051
WIFE. 

303
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,153
MY DAUGHTER. 

304
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:34,386
MY MOM. 

305
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,921
BUT ORRIN HATCH AND NOW LINDSAY 

306
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,289
GRAHAM HAVE REALLY GONE ON THE 

307
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,758
OFFENSIVE AND I WONDER IF THEY 

308
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,659
ARE NOT PERHAPS READING THE TEA 

309
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,428
LEAVES THE WAY YOU ARE. 

310
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,130
I'M SURE THEY ARE. 

311
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,197
THEY HAVE A STAFF AND EVERYONE 

312
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,366
OUT THERE TELLING THEM WHAT THE 

313
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,934
VIBE IN THE COUNTRY IS BUT IT 

314
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:51,103
ALMOST FEELS AS IF THEY ARE 

315
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:51,904
PERSONALLY AFFRONTED BY THE 

316
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,907
ACCUSATIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT 

317
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,975
AND MAYBE THEY'RE CONFLATING 

318
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,109
THE NUMEROUS ACCUSATIONS THAT 

319
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,176
HAVE COME OUT SINCE HERS BUT 

320
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:01,880
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THERE TODAY. 

321
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,719
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HAS 

322
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,186
CHANGED HIS APPROACH? 

323
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:07,687
THE PRESIDENT. 

324
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,821
INWOUNDER IF THEY'RE FOLLOWING 

325
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,989
HIS LEAD AS WELL. 

326
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,724
>> Reporter: LET'S MAKE YOUNG 

327
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,426
MEN AND HIMSELF HE'S BEEN 

328
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,760
VICTIMIZED BY ALL THE FALSE 

329
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,093
ACCUSATIONS. 

330
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,095
OR YOU KNOW NEARLY TWO DOZEN 

331
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:16,529
WOMEN. 

332
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,931
THAT HAVE COME FORWARD AND HAVE 

333
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,833
ACCUSED HIM OF VERY SIMILAR 

334
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,568
THINGS AND HE HAS A VERY 

335
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:22,968
PARTICULAR LENS. 

336
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:27,006
A PERSONAL LENS BY WHICH WE 

337
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,973
VIEWS THIS. 

338
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:28,908
AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE 

339
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,042
IN BASE AMERICA AND OTHERS WHO 

340
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:30,943
FEEL THE SAME WAY AND IT'S 

341
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,279
ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE HEARING THE 

342
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,480
SENATORS ECHO THAT SENTIMENT. 

343
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,448
AND PART OF IT IS, THE 

344
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:36,749
OVERREACH. 

345
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,951
IT'S NOW IT EMS LIKE IT'S 

346
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,620
KIND OF PILING ON ALL THESE 

347
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,287
DIFFERENT ANONYMOUS LETTERS. 

348
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:43,321
MAYBE I RECOLLECT IT. 

349
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,590
MAYBE I DON'T. 

350
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,126
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS, DR. 

351
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,728
FORD, IT'S REALLY GOING TO 

352
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,362
COMMA KNOW A MA KNOW. 

353
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:56,034
HAND TO HAND -- COME MANO E 

354
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:56,234
MANO. 

355
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,704
VERY STRONG APPEAL -- ON BOTH 

356
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,005
SIDES. 

357
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,340
>> ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IN OUR 

358
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,573
FRIEND. 

359
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,577
WHO IS JOINING US ALSO FROM 

360
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:04,977
WASHINGTON, D.C.. 

361
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:05,611
LINDA TRAN. 

362
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,445
YOU ARE THE FOUNDING PARTNER OF 

363
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,847
270 STRATEGIES AND YOU ARE 

364
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,747
JOINING US FROM WASHINGTON. 

365
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,516
ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON OUR 

366
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:10,917
PANEL. 

367
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:11,884
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

368
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,818
>> THANK YOU. 

369
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,489
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU SORT OF A 

370
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:16,889
SIMILAR QUESTION. 

371
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,724
WE ALL HAVE NOW SEEN THAT 

372
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,024
PHOTOGRAPH. 

373
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:24,997
THAT WAS SNAPPED BY OUR BEAU 

374
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,597
ERICSON OF SENATOR MURKOWSKI 

375
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:27,033
AND FEINSTEIN SOMEWHERE IN THE 

376
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,868
CAPITOL BUILDING AND MAYBE 

377
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,634
THROW THAT PICTURE UP. 

378
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,437
BUT IT SHOWS SORT OF THE 

379
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,006
INTENSE DISCUSSION THAT SENATOR 

380
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,142
FEINSTEIN IS HAVING WITH LISA 

381
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:36,442
MURKOWSKI. 

382
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,943
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? 

383
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,912
BECAUSE MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS 

384
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,214
AND BOB CORKER AND JEFF FLAKE 

385
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,317
ARE THOSE SENATORS WHICH ARE 

386
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:46,285
SORT OF UNDECIDED. 

387
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,287
AT LEAST IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS 

388
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,720
THAT THEY'VE MADE. 

389
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,657
UNDECIDED ABOUT WHERE THEY 

390
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,258
ULTIMATELY WILL VOTE. 

391
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,592
AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THESE 

392
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,727
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT. 

393
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,063
AT THE VERY LEAST, SOME OF THEM 

394
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,464
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE SENATE 

395
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,199
SHOULD OR THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 

396
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,902
ASK THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE 

397
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:03,568
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 

398
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,037
ALL EYES WILL BE ON THEM. 

399
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:09,642
THE HOW MUCH -- HOW MUCH 

400
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,209
INFLUENCE DO YOU THINK THAT 

401
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:10,910
SENATOR FEINSTEIN FOR EXAMPLE 

402
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,745
WILL HAVE ON HER FRIENDS 

403
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,512
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT. 

404
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,580
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE FRIENDS 

405
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,082
AND THEY'RE COLLEAGUES AND THEY 

406
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,018
DO TALK TO EACH OTHER BEYOND 

407
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,385
THE CAMERAS. 

408
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:20,652
>> YES. 

409
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,521
I MEAN, IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS 

410
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,923
WHAT PRECISELY THEY WERE 

411
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,758
TALKING ABOUT AS YOU SAID IN 

412
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,926
THE BOWELS THERE. 

413
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,095
BUT YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT 

414
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,264
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS APPEALING 

415
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,966
TO SENATOR MURKOWSKI TO GIVE 

416
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,067
THE ACCUSER A CHANCE TO STATE 

417
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:35,467
HER CASE. 

418
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,404
TO LISTEN TO THE DETAILS THAT 

419
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:38,737
SHE PROVIDES. 

420
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,106
TO LISTEN TO THE RESPONSES THAT 

421
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,340
SHE OFFERS TODAY TO THE 

422
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,676
QUESTIONS THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM 

423
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,043
THE PROSECUTOR. 

424
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,343
BEFORE SHE MAKES A DECISION. 

425
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:46,712
ALSO IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN 

426
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,013
ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT 

427
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,815
SENATOR MURKOWSKI IS GOING TO 

428
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,484
BE A KEY VOTE IN THAT 

429
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,418
PARTICULAR SCENARIO, ALSO BEEN 

430
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,719
ESSENTIALLY A SWING VOTE ON 

431
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,454
SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT 

432
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,624
HAVE COME BEFORE THE SENATE 

433
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,759
DURING THE TRUMP 

434
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,126
ADMINISTRATION. 

435
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:00,660
INCLUDING THEIR EFFORT TO 

436
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,295
REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 

437
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,897
SO LISA MURKOWSKI IS USED TO 

438
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:05,397
BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT. 

439
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,633
SHE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS MADE A 

440
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,703
CAREER OUT OF DEMONSTRATING HER 

441
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,036
INDEPENDENCE. 

442
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,138
AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE WILL 

443
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:15,107
LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS TODAY 

444
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,008
WITH GREAT ATTENTION. 

445
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,575
>> LINDA, I'M CURIOUS ABOUT 

446
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,778
YOUR POINT OF VIEW. 

447
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,979
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK 

448
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:20,679
ABOUT REPUBLICAN SENATORS LIKE 

449
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,714
JEFF FLAKE AND YOU KNOW WHETHER 

450
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,850
OR NOT THEY ALL DECIDE NOD TO 

451
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,319
VOTE IN -- NOT TO VOTE IN FAVOR 

452
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,354
OF HIM. 

453
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,389
BUT THERE ARE DEMOCRATS TOO 

454
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,223
LIKE JOE MANCHIN WHO ARE 

455
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,591
FACTORING IN THAT HE'S COMING 

456
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,058
FROM A SPREAD STATE. 

457
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:34,126
IS THERE ANY ANSWER -- RED 

458
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:34,660
STATE. 

459
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,528
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT 

460
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,497
REPUBLICANS COULD VOTE IN HIS 

461
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,033
FAIR OR IN THIS ENVIRONMENT 

462
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,770
THAT'S -- FAVOR OR IN THIS 

463
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,906
ENVIRONMENT THAT'S NEVER GOING 

464
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:47,739
TO HAPPEN? 

465
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:48,139
DEMOCRATS RATHER. 

466
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,208
>> DEMOCRATS, THE SENATORS WHO 

467
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,278
ARE ALSO UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT 

468
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,312
AND CERTAINLY INCLUDE SENATOR 

469
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:53,579
MANSION. 

470
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,014
BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT 

471
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,850
ACTUALLY THE DSCC JUST PULLED 

472
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,151
SOME OF THEIR DEDICATED BUDGET 

473
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,786
TO ADVERTISEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 

474
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:00,986
HIM. 

475
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,087
SO THERE'S A SENSE THAT HE'S IN 

476
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,056
A PRETTY GOOD POSITION AND 

477
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,757
HONESTLY, THE FACT THAT DR. 

478
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,026
FORD HAS COME FORWARD AND SOME 

479
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,129
OF THESE OTHER ACCUSATIONS HAVE 

480
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,163
OCCURRED, MAKES IT SOMEWHAT 

481
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,665
EASIER FOR EVEN THE RED STATE 

482
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,500
DEMOCRATS THAT WE'VE BEEN 

483
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,100
WATCHING TO POTENTILLY VOTE 

484
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,267
NO. 

485
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,803
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY 

486
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,339
VOTED TO SUPPORT KNEEL GORSUCH 

487
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,674
LAST -- NEIL GORSUCH LAST GO 

488
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:21,907
ROUND. 

489
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,008
>> THE RESULTS OF THE TEST ARE 

490
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,410
NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE SENATE 

491
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,977
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TODAY. 

492
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,046
THE DOCUMENTS SHOW FORD TEST 

493
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,282
THE TEST ON -- TOOK THE TEST ON 

494
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,650
AUGUST 7th AND PASSED. 

495
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,117
CBS NEWS POLITICAL 

496
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,219
CORRESPONDENT ED O'KEEFE SPOKE 

497
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,254
WITH THE FORMER FBI AGENT WHO 

498
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,323
CONDUCTED THE POLYGRAPH EXAM. 

499
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,724
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THAT. 

500
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,161
>> ALTER BEHAVIOR, I FELT HER 

501
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,262
ANSWERS DURING THE INTERVIEW 

502
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:45,197
WERE VERY APPROPRIATE. 

503
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,732
SO AGAIN, SHE WAS NERVOUS AND 

504
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,633
EVERYBODY WHO TAKES THE TEST -- 

505
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,236
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS NERVOUS AND 

506
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,170
EVERYBODY WHO TAKES THE 

507
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,237
POLYGRAPH TEST IS NERVOUS. 

508
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,305
I THOUGHT ALL THE BEHAVIORS AND 

509
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,507
ALL HER ANSWERS I THOUGHT 

510
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,207
EVERYTHING THAT SHE DID WAS 

511
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:56,742
APPROPRIATE. 

512
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,343
WHAT WE BASICALLY CALL IT WAS 

513
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,914
AN UNREMARKABLE POLYGRAPH TEST. 

514
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,250
>> BUT IS HER INNER TRUTH, WHAT 

515
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,385
SHE BELIEVES TO BE TRUE, 

516
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,621
POTENTIALLY NOT THE ACTUAL 

517
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:08,888
TRUTH? 

518
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:09,655
>> PEOPLE SOMETIMES THINK OKAY. 

519
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,190
IF I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS 

520
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,726
EVENT HAPPENED, THEN I CAN PASS 

521
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,393
A POLYGRAPH. 

522
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:14,960
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. 

523
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,762
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 

524
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,364
HOWEVER, YOU -- THAT'S ONE OF 

525
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,233
THE REASONS YOU DO YOUR 

526
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:21,700
INTERVIEW BEFOREHAND. 

527
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:21,900
OKAY? 

528
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,902
YOU ASKED QUESTIONS AND YOU 

529
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:24,569
ASKED FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS OKAY? 

530
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,739
IS THAT A POSSIBILITY TO 

531
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,273
SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD 

532
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:28,506
HAPPEN? 

533
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:28,807
ABSOLUTELY. 

534
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,808
BUT IN MY OPINION, AND AFTER 

535
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,643
HER PASSING THE TEST AND MY 

536
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:35,080
INTERACTION WITH HER, I DON'T 

537
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,647
THINK SHE'S MISTAKEN. 

538
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:36,715
>> YOU KNOW, LESLIE I THINK 

539
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,649
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE TEST BE 

540
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,452
SUBMITTED TO THE SENATE 

541
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:40,919
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

542
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,987
BECAUSE YOU HAVE HEARD PEOPLE 

543
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,355
EVERYONE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF 

544
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,892
THE UNITED STATES TO SURROGATES 

545
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,928
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH SEEMINGLY 

546
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:49,728
SUGGESTING THAT WHAT WE'RE 

547
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,064
WITNESSING WHEN IT COMES TO 

548
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:52,765
THESE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF 

549
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,599
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE ARE 

550
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,402
SOMEHOW AND TO USE THE 

551
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,004
PRESIDENT'S WORDS, A CON JOB. 

552
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,639
THAT THIS -- THIS PERSON, THIS 

553
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,274
DOCTOR, WOKE UP ONE DAY AND 

554
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,175
SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? 

555
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:03,775
I DON'T LIKE BRETT KAVANAUGH 

556
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,145
AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY 

557
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:06,878
FAMILY'S LIFE OUT THERE AND 

558
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,080
BUTT MY KIN -- PUT MY 

559
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,981
CHILDREN'S LIFE OUT THERE AND 

560
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,618
I'M GOING TO COME OUT AND 

561
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,852
SUGGEST SOMETHING THAT'S 

562
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,654
EXPLOSIVE SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M A 

563
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,057
TOOL OF THE DEMOCRATS. 

564
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,758
NOW ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE 

565
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,028
ALSO SOME KIND OF A PLOT TO 

566
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,929
DERAIL WRECK'S NOMINATION. 

567
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,331
-- BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

568
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:25,631
NOMINATION. 

569
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,366
WHEREAS WE DIDN'T SEE THAT WITH 

570
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,300
NEIL GORSUCH OR JOHN ROBERTS OR 

571
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,036
ALL THE OTHER SUPREME COURT 

572
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,004
NOMINEES THAT HAVE COME SINCE 

573
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:32,404
CLARENCE THOMAS. 

574
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,340
SO ISN'T IT IMPORTANT FOR THE 

575
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,973
REPUBLICANS ON THE COMMITTEE 

576
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:36,976
AND THE REPUBLICANS WHO MAKE UP 

577
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,512
THE SENATE AS A WHOLE, TO NOT 

578
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,246
SEEMINGLY IMPUGN HER CHARACTER 

579
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,915
JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE 

580
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,584
SUPPORTIVE OF BRETT KAVANAUGH? 

581
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,819
>> EXACTLY RIGHT. 

582
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,120
BECAUSE THE DEFAULT WAS -- THE 

583
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,655
KNEE JERK RESPONSE, WE WILL 

584
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,223
SUPPORT BRETT KAVANAUGH AT ALL 

585
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,524
COSTS. 

586
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,225
THERE'S NOTHING, AFTER SIX FBI 

587
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:54,860
INVESTIGATIONS, AFTER TWO 

588
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,561
CONFIRMATIONS, TO BELIEVE THAT 

589
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,830
HE WOULD HAVE THIS IN HIS 

590
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,130
CHARACTER. 

591
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,031
BUT NO ONE WITHIN BACK AND 

592
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,432
ASKED WHAT YOU DID AT THE HIGH 

593
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:00,899
SCHOOL PARTY RIGHT? 

594
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,370
SO THIS IS A NEW AREA WE'RE 

595
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,703
GOING INTO. 

596
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,910
IT'S THE VERIES ARETY OF 

597
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,177
INDEPENDENCE -- VORACITY OF 

598
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:12,778
INDEPENDENCE. 

599
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:13,579
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. 

600
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,949
IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHALLENGE 

601
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,750
SOMEBODY OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

602
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,050
CHARACTER. 

603
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,986
AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS HARD TO 

604
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,654
TAKE THE POLITICAL ASPECT FROM 

605
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:23,188
REALLY HOW SERIOUS THIS 

606
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,491
ALLEGATION IS AND THAT'S WHY I 

607
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,191
THINK FUNDAMENTALLY IT COMES 

608
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,426
DOWN TO THE TWO PEOPLE. 

609
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,662
NOT THE OTHER NOISE OF OTHER 

610
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,464
KIND OF INSTANTED AND -- 

611
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,000
UNSUBSTANTIATED AND SOME WOULD 

612
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,701
ARGUES THIS UNSUBSTANTIATED. 

613
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,268
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

614
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,003
DESERVE THIS IS AMOUNT OF 

615
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:38,637
RESPECT. 

616
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,773
>> WHY ARE THE MALE SENATORS SO 

617
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,107
INCLINED TO GO ON TELEVISION 

618
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,709
AND FOX NEWS AND BE 

619
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,943
DISBELIEVING OF HER ASSERTIONS 

620
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,245
BUT ARE UNWILLING TO SATE IN A 

621
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,880
LINE OF FIRE -- SIT IN A LINE 

622
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,681
OF FIRE AND QUESTION HER WHEN 

623
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:50,682
SHE'S STANDING RIGHT IS THERE? 

624
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:53,052
>> THE TRUTH IS THEY'RE SO 

625
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,353
CYNICAL. 

626
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,721
I MEAN ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IN 

627
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,359
WASHINGTON THIS LONG FINDS IT 

628
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,593
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT AN HONEST 

629
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,330
PERSON WOULD COME FORWARD AFTER 

630
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,464
30 MANAGER YEARS. 

631
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,966
THEY -- SOMETHING YEAR, VERSUS 

632
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:08,466
A POLITICALLY CONCAVED 

633
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,235
MOTIVATOR AND YOU HAVE SCHUMER 

634
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,103

00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,904
HANDS TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE 

636
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:13,104
THIS. 

637
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:13,839
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AND 

638
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,007
THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE 

639
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,075
PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE THAT 

640
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,443
REGARDLESS WHAT HAPPENS TODAY. 

641
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:17,676
>> WOW. 

642
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,677

643
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,112

ONE PROTESTER THERE WITH TEARS 

654
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,162
IN THEIR EYES.

00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,416
I THINK THAT'S FAIRLY TYPICAL. 

739
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,285
BLUE THIS CASE HUH -- BUT IN 

740
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,018
THIS CASE SHE KNEW BRETT 

741
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:29,287
KAVANAUGH AND SHE KNEW WHO WAS 

742
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:32,224
ATTACKING HER AND THERE'S NO 

743
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,359
QUESTION ABOUT HIS ISOLATE. 

744
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:35,760
MISS -- IDENTITY. 

745
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,763
THIS IS SOMETHING SHE'S BEEN 

746
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,332
CLEAR ON SINCE THE BEGINNING 

747
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,034
AND EVERIEN STANCE THAT -- 

748
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,068
INSTANCE THAT SHE BROUGHT THE 

749
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,469
INFORMATION FORWARD TO A 

750
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,871
FRIEND. 

751
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,873
>> OKAY SAMANTHA GARY THANKS SO 

752
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:48,073
MUCH. 

753
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:48,440
>> MY PLEASURE. 

754
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,141
>> AND ADAM BLAKE IS A SENIOR 

755
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,009
POLITICAL REPORTER FOR THE 

756
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,345
"WASHINGTON POST" AND JOINS US 

757
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:53,845
NOW FROM WASHINGTON. 

758
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,815
SO AARON, A FULL SENATE VOTE 

759
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,415
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH'S CON FIR 

760
00:21:57,415 --> 00:22:00,952
MISSION COULD BE MUCH CLOSER 

761
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,485
THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. 

762
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:03,054
REPUBLICANS JEFF FLAKE AND BOB 

763
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:05,657
CORKER ARE TWO SENATORS WHO 

764
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,491
APPEAR TO BE UNDECIDED THOUGH. 

765
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,058
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID 

766
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:07,358
YESTERDAY. 

767
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:08,560
>> IF WE CANNOT HAVE A HUMAN 

768
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,294
RATHER THAN A POLITICAL 

769
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:12,731
RESPONSE TO THESE WITNESSES, IF 

770
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,831
WE ARE HEEDLESS TO THE CAPACITY 

771
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:16,001
THAT WE HAVE TO DO REAL AND 

772
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,904
LASTING DAMAGE THEN WE 

773
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,705
SHOULDN'T BE HERE. 

774
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,475
>> I ENTERED THIS HEARING WITH 

775
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,576
GOOD FEELINGS ABOUT OUR 

776
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:24,976
NOMINEE. 

777
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:25,643
AND MY PERSONAL INTERACTIONS 

778
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:29,348
WITH HIM AND THE FIRST HEARING. 

779
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,751
BUT LOOK, I MEAN, MY JOB IS TO 

780
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,685
TAKE IN ALL THE INFORMATION AND 

781
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,955
TOMORROW I'LL BE LISTENING TO 

782
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,923
EVERY WORD OF WHAT HAPPENS. 

783
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:39,491
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING 

784
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,892
ADDITIONAL THAT HAPPENS, I DO 

785
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:41,325
THE SAME THING. 

786
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,528
>> ALL RIGHT AARON AND THAT'S 

787
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:43,961
CORKER AND FLAKE. 

788
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,764
THE OTHER TWO THAT PEOPLE ARE 

789
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,999
CLOSELY WATCHING, MURKOWSKI AND 

790
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,401
COLLINS, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING 

791
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,135
FROM YOUR SOURCES ABOUT WHERE 

792
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:50,836
THEY ARE TODAY? 

793
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,738
>> I THINK THAT JEFF FLAKE'S 

794
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,439
COMMENTS YESTERDAY WERE THE 

795
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:54,772
MOST TELLING. 

796
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,575
HE TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT 

797
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,910
THIS HEARING, THE VOTE ON IT 

798
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,977
RATHER, THAT IS SCHEDULED FOR 

799
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:01,412
FRIDAY, MIGHT HAVE TO BE 

800
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:02,547
DELAYED IF SOMETHING COMES OUT 

801
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,383
OF THIS HEARING THAT NEEDS TO 

802
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:05,716
BE REVIEWED. 

803
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:07,652
HE SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST 

804
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,254
PUBLICLY EXPRESSING OPENNESS TO 

805
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,021
A DELAY. 

806
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,923
AND THIS IS A GUY WHO COULD 

807
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,791
PREVENT THE COMMITTEE FROM 

808
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,759
VOTING FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

809
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,763
HE IS ONE PERSON ON A COMMITTEE 

810
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:19,897
THAT'S SPLIT 11-10 FOR 

811
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:21,799
REPUBLICANS WHO COULD TOWARD 

812
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,234
THAT VOTE. 

813
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:22,867
THEY -- THWART THAT VOTE. 

814
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,202
THEY COULD CONFIRM BRETT 

815
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,637
KAVANAUGH ON THE FULL SENATE 

816
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,405
ANYWAYS WITHOUT THE SENATE 

817
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:27,872
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S 

818
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,307
ENDORSEMENT OF HIM BUT THAT 

819
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,542
WOULD BE A HIGHLY UNUSUAL SET 

820
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,743
OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK 

821
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,681
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE 

822
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,016
DIFFICULT GIVEN THE CLOSE -- 

823
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,152
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT GIVEN THE 

824
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:40,619
CLOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. 

825
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,188
>> THAT'S NOT ALL THAT THESE 

826
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:43,888
LAWMAKERS WILL BE CONSIDERING. 

827
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:46,123
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS DO 

828
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,125
YOU BELIEVE THEY'LL BE TAKING 

829
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:48,559
INTO CONSIDERATION? 

830
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,829
>> WELL, I THINK A LOT OF IT IS 

831
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,430
GOING TO BE NOT NECESSARILY DID 

832
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,332
THIS HAPPEN OR DID THIS NOT 

833
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:54,699
HAPPEN? 

834
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,467
A LOT OF IT IS GOING TO BE 

835
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:57,468
RECOUPABLING DETAILS OF WHAT -- 

836
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,604
RECOUNTING DETAILS OF WHAT 

837
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,606
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD AND BRETT 

838
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,341
KAVANAUGH HAVE SAID ABOUT THIS 

839
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:03,842
SITUATION. 

840
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,077
GOING THROUGH THEIR ACCOUNTS OF 

841
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,746
THIS, WHICH IN SOME KEY DETAILS 

842
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,114
HAVE CONTRASTED WITH ONE 

843
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,847
ANOTHER AND TRYING TO FIGURE 

844
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,783
OUT THE EITHER OF THEM CAN BE 

845
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,385
ESTABLISHED AS BEING MORE 

846
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,020
CREDIBLE THAN THE OTHER ONE. 

847
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,024
A KEY DIFFERENCE THAT I NOTICED 

848
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,125
YESTERDAY IN THE POLYGRAPH 

849
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,394
REPORT THAT CHRISTINE BLASEY 

850
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:25,964
FORD THE GAVE, SHE -- SHE GAVE. 

851
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,334
SHE SAID SHE DATED ONE OF BRETT 

852
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:29,801
KAVANAUGH'S FRIENDS. 

853
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,803
ALBEIT BRETT KAVANAUGH IN HIS 

854
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,703
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW SUGGESTED 

855
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:34,172
THAT THEY REALLY WEREN'T IN THE 

856
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,508
SAME SOCIAL CIRCLES THAT HE 

857
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,174
MIGHT HAVE MET HER. 

858
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,510
AND REALLY DOWNPLAYED THE IDEA 

859
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,246
THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO SHE 

860
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:41,746
WAS FAMILIAR WITH. 

861
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,748
AND SO YOU MIGHT SEE THE 

862
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,917
PROSECUTOR FOR REPUBLICANS AND 

863
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,419
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS TRY AND 

864
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,920
ESTABLISH WHICH OF THOSE CLAIMS 

865
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,922
IS MORE CLOSE TO REALITY AND I 

866
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,123
THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S 

867
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,124
IMPORTANT HERE IS WHICH PERSON 

868
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,359
COMES OUT OF THIS HEARING 

869
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,061
LOOKING MORE CREDIBLE AND 

870
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,661
LOOKING MORE CONSISTENT. 

871
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,029
>> AS YOU KNOW AARON, 

872
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,397
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ON THE 

873
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,832
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ARE 

874
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,033
NOT EXPECTED TO QUESTION THE 

875
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:02,467
WITNESSES. 

876
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,371
THEY WILL LIKELY YIELD TO 

877
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:06,771
RACHEL MITCHELL. 

878
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,739
THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. 

879
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,908
WHAT ARE THE OPTICS OF THAT? 

880
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,076
>> WELL, CERTAINLY THEY WANTED 

881
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:14,779
TO AVOID HAVING 11 WHITE MEN ON 

882
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,315
THE COMMITTEE OLDER WHITE MEN 

883
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:21,286
AND A LOT OF CASES, GO AFTER 

884
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,587
THIS PERSON WHO'S MAKING A VERY 

885
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,021
SERIOUS ACCUSATION, ANYBODY WHO 

886
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,791
LISTENS TO THE TAPES OF THE 

887
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,494
CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS IN 

888
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,429
WHICH REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 

889
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,631
VERY FORCEFULLY QUESTIONING 

890
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,766
ANITA HILL IN WAYS THAT DON'T 

891
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,601
NECESSARILY REFLECT VERY WELL 

892
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,305
UPON THEM 27 YEARS LATER, WILL 

893
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:40,838
UNDERSTAND THAT DECISION. 

894
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,908
I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE BEHIND 

895
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,176
THE SCENES RIGHT NOW, YOU 

896
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:50,448
PROBABLY WOULD SEE MITCH 

897
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,149
McCONNELL AND JUDICIARY 

898
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:51,682
CHAIRMAN CHUCK GRASSLEY 

899
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:52,384
ADVISING ALL THE REPUBLICAN 

900
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,185
SENATORS TO STAY OUT OF THIS 

901
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,054
AND NOT TALK EVEN IF THEY THINK 

902
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,355
THEY HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT 

903
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,490
POINT MAKE BECAUSE THE DOWNSIDE 

904
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,658
OF HAVING A REALLY BAD MOMENT 

905
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:01,693
IS SO SIGNIFICANT. 

906
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,061
>> AARON BLAKE, THANK YOU SO 

907
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:03,461
MUCH. 

908
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,562
>> THANK YOU. 

909
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:04,996
>> ALL RIGHT. 

910
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:08,233
SO TODAY'S HEARING WILL LIKELY 

911
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,935
COME DOWN TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

912
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,636
WORD AGAINST HIS ACCUSERS. 

913
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:15,006
>> JENNA ELLIS IS A ATTORNEY 

914
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,741
AND JOINS US NOW FROM DENVER. 

915
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,843
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

916
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:19,744
VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING HIS 

917
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,011
NOMINEE. 

918
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,680
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS FLATLY 

919
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,747
DENIED ALL THE ALLEGATIONS 

920
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,080
AGAINST HIM. 

921
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,216
SO WHY DO YOU BELIEVE HE'S 

922
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,853
TELLING THE TRUTH AND NOT DR. 

923
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,221
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD? 

924
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,623
DEBORAH RAMIREZ AND ALSO JULIE 

925
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:31,890
SWETNICK. 

926
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,858
>> WELL -- WELL, I DON'T THINK 

927
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,494
THAT THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED 

928
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:36,694
YET. 

929
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,963
WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THE 

930
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:40,065
CONTEXT OF THE SENATE 

931
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,466
CONFIRMATION HEARING. 

932
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,266
THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL TRIAL. 

933
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,802
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A 

934
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,969
VERDICT OR FINDING OF GUILT. 

935
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,504
WE'RE LOOKING FOR FAIRNESS IN 

936
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,006
THE PROCESS AND WE'RE LOOKING 

937
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,741
TO MAKE SURE THAT BRETT 

938
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,776
KAVANAUGH'S ACTUALLY FIT FOR 

939
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,009
OFFICE. 

940
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:52,777
THE SENATE UNDER THE 

941
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,813
CONSTITUTION IS VESTED WITH THE 

942
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,815
POWER TO ADVISE AND ULTIMATELY 

943
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,349
CONSENT OR NOT TO A JUDICIAL 

944
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:58,616
NOMINEE. 

945
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,686
WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER FROM A 

946
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,655
BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT 

947
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,356
THIS IS ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY 

948
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:07,025
WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 

949
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,493
BELIEVES ABOUT DUE PROCESS. 

950
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,861
AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND THE 

951
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:10,929
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS TO 

952
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,464
COMMENCE AND WE NEED TO MAKE 

953
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,098
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING 

954
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,800
HERE TO JUST SIMPLY BELIEVE ONE 

955
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,703
OVER THE OTHER BUT WE NEED TO 

956
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:19,337
MAKE SURE THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

957
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,839
HAS THE PRESUMPTION OF 

958
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,639
INNOCENCE. 

959
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,239
FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AND WE 

960
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:24,476
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 

961
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,109
PRESERVE ASKING PROTECTING OUR 

962
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:26,645
RULE -- PRESERVING AND 

963
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,846
PROTECTING OUR RULE OF LAW. 

964
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,482
THE FACT THAT ONE WOMAN'S 

965
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,683
ALLEGATION THAT'S 

966
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,118
UNCORROBORATED AND INSTANTED 

967
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:33,618
ABSENT SOMETHING -- 

968
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,119
UNSUBSTANTIATED ABSENT 

969
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:34,753
SOMETHING ELSE COMING OUT IN 

970
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,721
THE HEARING IS SETTINGS THIS UP 

971
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,789
TO BE A POLITICAL QUESTION 

972
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,359
RATHER THAN ADHERING TO THE 

973
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:41,759
RULE OF LOYALTY. 

974
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,094
>> WE HAVE YOU KNOW -- LAW 

975
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:43,495
ULTIMATELY. 

976
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,465
>> WE HAVE YOU KNOW BRETT 

977
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,532
KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER. 

978
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:50,602
NO OTHER WAY OF SORT OF 

979
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,903
VERIFYING EITHER OF THEIR 

980
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:52,136
STORY. 

981
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:53,271
DO YOU THINK WE CAN COME OUT 

982
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,106
WITH A CLEAR ANSWER AS TO WHO'S 

983
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,143
TELLING THE TRUTH AND WHO'S NOT 

984
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:58,710
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES? 

985
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,013
>> TRUTH NEEDS TO BE THE 

986
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,014
ULTIMATE QUESTION BUT HERE THE 

987
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,849
STANDARD OF COURSE WITH SENATE 

988
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,750
CONFIRMATION HEARING CONTEXT, 

989
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,385
WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR LEGAL 

990
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:07,818
STANDARD OF PROOF. 

991
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:11,356
SO IT NEEDS TO BE ONE AT 

992
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:11,923
MINIMUM OF REASONABLENESS. 

993
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,191
IS THE ALLEGATION IN THE 

994
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,626
CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING WE DO 

995
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,627
KNOW TO BE TRUE? 

996
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,163
EVERYTHING THAT IS ON THE 

997
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,565
RECORD OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

998
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,300
CLEAR HISTORY OF QUALIFICATIONS 

999
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,434
AND HIS SIX FBI BACKGROUND 

1000
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:24,535
CHECKS SINCE 1993, ALL OF THE 

1001
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:29,874
THINGS THAT WE DO KNOW ARE 

1002
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,075
TRUE. 

1003
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:35,013
IS THIS REALLY REASONABLE? 

1004
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:43,588
WHAT SHE'S CLAIMING VERSUS HIS 

1005
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:44,088
EMINENT QUALIFICATION. 

1006
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:47,158
DR. JAMES DOBSON WHO'S MY BOSS 

1007
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,295
WAS QUOTED ON CBS ACTUALLY 

1008
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:50,929
YESTERDAY SAYING UNLESS THERE'S 

1009
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,997
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S COMING 

1010
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,532
OUT AND THERE'S SOME OTHER 

1011
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,033
EVIDENCE. 

1012
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:55,833
HE WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT BRETT 

1013
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,303
KAVANAUGH AND I WOULD AGREE 

1014
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,103
WITH THAT ASSESS. 

1015
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,372
THIS HAS BECOME -- ASSESSMENT. 

1016
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,306
THIS HAS BECOME A POLITICAL 

1017
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:02,539
CIRCUS. 

1018
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,342
>> YOU KNOW, YOU RAISE A GOOD 

1019
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,142
POINT ABOUT THE PRESUMPTON OF 

1020
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:05,442
INNOCENCE. 

1021
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:08,279
BUT THIS ISN'T A COURT OF LAW. 

1022
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,015
THERE IS A CREDIBILITY ISSUE AT 

1023
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,716
PLAY HERE. 

1024
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:12,550
AND AT THE VERY LEAST, WHEN 

1025
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,786
BRETT KAVANAUGH DOES A 

1026
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,386
TELEVISION INTERVIEW, AND HE 

1027
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,689
DOWNPLAYS THE AMOUNT OF THE 

1028
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,656
DRINKING THAT HE HAS DONE AS A 

1029
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,292
YOUNG MAN OR EVEN AS AN ADULT 

1030
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,427
AND THEN THESE ALLEGATIONS COME 

1031
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,128
OUT WHERE THEY SEEM TO SUGGEST 

1032
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:24,962
THAT HE LIKES TO PARTY. 

1033
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,064
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 

1034
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,499
BUT TO SUGGEST AS HE DID THAT 

1035
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,001
HE DOESN'T DO THOSE THINGS, 

1036
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:30,935
THAT'S WHERE YOU START TO SEE 

1037
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,603
THIS CREDIBILITY GAP. 

1038
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:33,938
IT'S NOTE A QUESTION OF THE 

1039
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,805
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. 

1040
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:36,174
WHICH WAS OF COURSE INTEGRAL TO 

1041
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:36,874
OUR RULE OF LAW. 

1042
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:39,010
THIS IS ABOUT A MAN WHO SAYS HE 

1043
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,311
DOESN'T DO EVEN REMOTELY SOME 

1044
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,846
OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

1045
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:42,379
SAID THAT'S OKAY TO DO. 

1046
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:45,984
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A COUPLE OF 

1047
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:46,217
BEERS. 

1048
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:50,488
>> HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OF THE 

1049
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:50,922
WOMEN AT ALL. 

1050
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,359
>> I WONDER IF THE CORRECT GAP 

1051
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,761
IS -- CREDIBILITY GAP IS WHY 

1052
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,294
PERHAPS WHAT DR. FORD'S 

1053
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:58,396
ALLEGATIONS ARE SHOULD BE AT 

1054
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,431
LEAST LISTENED TO AND AT SOME 

1055
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,268
LEVEL THERE'S GOT TO BE AN 

1056
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:06,471
UNDERSTANDING SHE WOULDN'T COME 

1057
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,705
OUT AND SAY THE THINGS BECAUSE 

1058
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,141
SHE WANTS TO PUT HERSELF AND 

1059
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,910
HER FAMILY UNDER THE GLARE OF 

1060
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,210
SPOTLIGHT. 

1061
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,278
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF 

1062
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,479
ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU JUST SAID. 

1063
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,213
THAT HE'S DOWNPLAYING THE 

1064
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,714
ALLEGATIONS AND QUESTIONING HER 

1065
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,949
MOTIVE OF SAYING YOU KNOW SHE 

1066
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:18,549
WOULDN'T HAVE COME FORWARD 

1067
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:22,186
UNLESS SHE WAS TELLING THE 

1068
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:22,419
TRUTH. 

1069
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:23,220
THOSE ARE ALL ASSUMPTIONS. 

1070
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,491
THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF 

1071
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,692
REASONS WHY SOMEONE MAY COME 

1072
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,926
FORWARD WITH THIS TYPE OF 

1073
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:29,226
ALLEGATION. 

1074
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:30,962
CERTAINLY THAT THE DEMOCRATS 

1075
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,798
HAVE HELD ON TO THIS EVIDENCE 

1076
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,398
UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THE 

1077
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:34,899
CONFIRMATION -- 

1078
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,335
>> HE SAID HE DOESN'T DRINK. 

1079
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,903
>> EVEN JUST THE STORY ITSELF. 

1080
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,906
>> HE SAYS HE DOESN'T DRINK. 

1081
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,109
HE SAYS HE ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF 

1082
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,110
BEERS HERE AND THERE. 

1083
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,946
INCLUDING FROM HIS FRIEND, MARK 

1084
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:48,680
JUDGE, SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT HE 

1085
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,181
HAS MORE THAN A COUPLE OF BEERS 

1086
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,317
AND HAS HAD THAT HABIT FOR 

1087
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:53,751
MANY, MANY YEARS. 

1088
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,753
>> AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO 

1089
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,488
HAVE AT LEAST A STANDARD OF 

1090
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,323
REASONABLENESS. 

1091
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,458
I AGREE YOU THAT IT'S A 

1092
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,695
CREDIBILITY ISSUE AND LOOKING 

1093
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,629
AT HIS FUNDAMENTAL FITNESS FOR 

1094
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,264
OFFICE WE STILL HAVE TO AGREE 

1095
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,398
THAT HE HAS CONSTITUTIONAL 

1096
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:07,798
PROTECTIONS HERE. 

1097
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,167
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT 

1098
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,501
WE'RE NOT LITIGATING THIS IN 

1099
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,871
THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. 

1100
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,306
WE'RE LITIGATING THIS IN REALLY 

1101
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:15,839
THE SENATE CONFIRMATION 

1102
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,106
HEARING. 

1103
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:17,876
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT 

1104
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,210
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ACTUALLY 

1105
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,078
ON THE RECORD. 

1106
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,412
NOT ANYTHING THAT HAS JUST BEEN 

1107
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,380
POSTED ON TWITTER, BY DEMOCRATS 

1108
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,115
LOOKING TO DELAY AND DERAIL THE 

1109
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:25,683
PROCESS. 

1110
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,119
BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE 

1111
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,254
HISTORIC DAY IN AMERICA. 

1112
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:31,021
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 

1113
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:32,991
PREFERRING AND PRESECT -- 

1114
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,726
PRESERVING AND PROTECTING OUR 

1115
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,259
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR 

1116
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,160
JUDICIAL NOMINEES AND THEY ARE 

1117
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,931
NOT DERAILED JUST BASTED ON THE 

1118
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:40,531
POLITICAL PARTY AFFILIATION. 

1119
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,568
THE DEMOCRATS STARTED BY TRYING 

1120
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,569
TO CONDEMN BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR 

1121
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,970
HAVING KETCHUP ON THE PASTA AND 

1122
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,373
NOW ACCUSING HIM ALL THE WAY UP 

1123
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:48,773
TO GANG RAPE. 

1124
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,808
IS THAT REALLY REASONABLE HERE 

1125
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,308
IN THIS CONTEXT? 

1126
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:55,380
OR IS THIS REALLY A POLITICAL 

1127
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:55,613
TARGET? 

1128
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,081
AND -- WE'RE ALWAYS CONCERNED 

1129
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,249
ABOUT THE TRUTH. 

1130
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:58,883
>> YOUR POINTS ARE ABSOLUTELY 

1131
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,752
-- YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN 

1132
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,286
BUT THE DEMOCRATS, IF YOU KNOW, 

1133
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,921
THE IDEA THAT DEMOCRATS WOULD 

1134
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,556
SOMEHOW BE DOING THIS BECAUSE 

1135
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,792
IT'S A CON JOB AS THE PRESIDENT 

1136
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,828
HAS SUGGESTED THEY DIDN'T DO 

1137
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,330
THAT WITH JUDGE GORSUCH OR JOHN 

1138
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,665
ROBERTS BECAUSE THERE WERE NO 

1139
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,332
QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT 

1140
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:18,202
THESE MEN MAY HAVE SEXUALLY 

1141
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:18,602
ASSAULTED WOMEN. 

1142
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:21,306
SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS 

1143
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,007
-- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS TO BE 

1144
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,442
THAT THE -- SURROGATES ARE 

1145
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,011
SAYING FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS 

1146
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,413
THESE THINGS ARE BEING DONE 

1147
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,614
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 

1148
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,848
DERAIL THE PROCESS. 

1149
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,250
WELL, THEY DIDN'T DERAIL IT 

1150
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,384
WITH THESE EXPLOSIVE 

1151
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:33,984
ALLEGATIONS FOR ALL THE OTHER 

1152
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:35,119
MEN THAT ARE SITTING ON THE 

1153
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,887
SUPREME COURT WITH THE 

1154
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:37,922
EXCEPTION OF JUDGE THOMAS. 

1155
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:38,455
SO -- 

1156
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:42,160
>> BUT THEY DID PUSH BACK ON 

1157
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,527
NEIL GORSUCH. 

1158
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,161
SENATOR McCONNELL AND OTHERS 

1159
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,562
HAD TO INVOKE THE NUCLEAR 

1160
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:44,795
OPTION. 

1161
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,297
REMEMBER THAT HAPPENED WITH 

1162
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:46,497
WHAT? 

1163
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,865
BUT THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT 

1164
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:48,131
CONTEXT. 

1165
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:49,233
I WROTE A PIECE FOR THE 

1166
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,568
"WASHINGTON EXAMINER" THIS WEEK 

1167
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,369
THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE 

1168
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,302
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT'S REALLY 

1169
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,872
ON THE LINE HERE IS PRO-LIFE 

1170
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:55,205
AND ABORTION. 

1171
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:57,809
AND THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE 

1172
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,276
FEARFUL OF LOSING. 

1173
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,845
IS THE MAJORITY OF ACTIVISTS ON 

1174
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:01,145
THE COURT. 

1175
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,681
AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT 

1176
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,116
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRETT 

1177
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,751
KAVANAUGH HAVE INCREASED BY THE 

1178
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,252
DEMOCRATS AND THEY ARE LOOKING 

1179
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,020
SIMPLY TO DERAIL THE PROCESS. 

1180
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,121
BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT 

1181
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:13,324
THEY'RE LOSING THEIR ACTIVIST 

1182
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,358
MAJORITY ON THE COURT. 

1183
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,994
AND TO HAVE CONSERVATIVES WHO 

1184
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,030
ARE ORIGINALISTS WHO WILL 

1185
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,830
PROTECT AND PRESERVE EVERY 

1186
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,965
PERSON'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT 

1187
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,266
INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE 

1188
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,067
UNBORN BECAUSE THAT'S 

1189
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:23,701
CONSISTENT WITH OUR 

1190
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:24,034
CONSTITUTION. 

1191
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,703
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S ON THE 

1192
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,003
LINE HERE. 

1193
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,706
AND SO THIS IS MUCH, MUCH 

1194
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,440
BIGGER THAN ONE CONFIRMATION 

1195
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:29,707
HEARING. 

1196
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,008
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUPREME 

1197
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:31,876
COURT FOR DECADES TO COME. 

1198
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,078
FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR 

1199
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:34,545
CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. 

1200
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,513
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS 

1201
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:35,746
ABOUT. 

1202
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:36,347
>> I THINK EVERYBODY'S WELL 

1203
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,049
AWARE OF IT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE 

1204
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,751
WATCHING THE OUTCOME OF THIS SO 

1205
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,085
CLOSELY. 

1206
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,587
JENNA ELLIS THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

1207
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,220
>> THANKS JENNA. 

1208
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,621
>> THANK YOU. 

1209
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,455
>>> ALL RIGHT, SO COMING UP 

1210
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,492
AFTER THE BREAK, WE WILL TAKE 

1211
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,460

00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,699
THIS TIME, INVOLVING ANITA HILL 

1215
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,166
AND CLARENCE THOMAS. 

1216
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,534
>> WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE 

1217
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,001
SIMILARITIES AND THE 

1218
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,136
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT CASE 

1219
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:58,836
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. 

1220
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:01,539
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 

1221
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,029

00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,935
SUPPORT FOR THE SUPREME COURT 

1228
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:49,640

00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:52,209
LEAVING HIMSELF A LITTLE BIT OF 

1232
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:52,542
WIGGLE ROOM. 

1233
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,412

1238
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:01,886
HEARING ROOM. 

1239
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,988
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS IN THE

QUESTIONED BID WEIJIA JIANG -- 

1249
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:24,374

MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS GUEST

HIM. 

1252
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:25,976
>> Reporter: IF I COULD 

1253
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:29,045
ACTUALLY ASK MY QUESTION MR. 

1254
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:29,279
TRUMP. 

1255
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:29,713
YOU DIDN'T LET ME. 

1256
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:31,682
>> YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING THE 

1257
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,751
QUESTION FOR TEN MINUTES. 

1258
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,151
PLEASE GO AHEAD. 

1259
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:34,785
>> Reporter: HOW DID THOSE 

1260
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,421
IMPACT YOUR OPINIONS ON THE 

1261
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:37,821
ALLEGATIONS -- 

1262
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:39,156
>> IT DOES IMPACT MY OPINION 

1263
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:39,823
YOU KNOW WHY? 

1264
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:41,892
BECAUSE I'VE HAD A LOT OF FALSE 

1265
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:42,793
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME. 

1266
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:43,928
I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON 

1267
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:44,295
UNFORTUNATELY. 

1268
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,464
I'VE BEEN A FAMOUS PERSON FOR A 

1269
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:46,764
LONG TIME. 

1270
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,700
BUT I HAVE HAD A LOT OF FALSE 

1271
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,101
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME. 

1272
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:51,568
REALLY FALSE CHARGES. 

1273
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:56,006
I KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD úF 

1274
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:56,974
PEOPLE WANT FAME. 

1275
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,374
THEY WANT MONEY. 

1276
00:37:57,374 --> 00:37:58,341
THEY WANT WHATEVER. 

1277
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:01,445
SO WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT 

1278
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,346
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY 

1279
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,047
SITTING HOME WATCHING 

1280
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,983
TELEVISION WHERE THEY SAY OH 

1281
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:06,583
JUDGE KAVANAUGH THIS OR THAT. 

1282
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,119
>> CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 

1283
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,819
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG IS 

1284
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,888
WITH US NOW FROM JUST OUTSIDE 

1285
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,023
OF TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK 

1286
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:13,223
CITY. 

1287
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:14,158
SO I THOUGHT THAT YOUR BACK AND 

1288
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,025
FORTH WITH THE PRESIDENT DURING 

1289
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:17,161
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS 

1290
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,697
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SORT 

1291
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,432
OF ILLUMINATING COMPONENTS OF 

1292
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,232
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE. 

1293
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:29,607
AND HE DIDN'T JUST STOP AT THE 

1294
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,642
LITTLE PIECE WE PLAYED. 

1295
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,276
EVENTUALLY HE TALKED ABOUT HOW 

1296
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:37,014
HE FEEL HE WAS THE VICTIM OF -- 

1297
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,716
FELT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF FALSE 

1298
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,049
ACCUSATIONS. 

1299
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:41,285
>> I HAD IN FALSE CHARGES -- 

1300
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:41,952
MANY FALSE CHARGES. 

1301
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,821
I HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN 

1302
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,755
AIRPLANE AND ATTACKED HER WHILE 

1303
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,290
PEOPLING WERE COMING ON THE 

1304
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,557
PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER ONE 

1305
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:49,327
BEST SELLER OUT. 

1306
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,164
I MEAN IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY 

1307
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:53,964
STORY, MORE IN OF THEM. 

1308
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,099
-- THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. 

1309
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,333
SO WHEN YOU SAY DOES IT ATE 

1310
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,234
TICKET ME WITH RESPECT TO -- 

1311
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,836
AFFECT ME WITH RESPECT TO JUDGE 

1312
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,136
KAVANAUGH? 

1313
00:38:59,136 --> 00:38:59,436
ABSOLUTELY. 

1314
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:01,138
>> SO I BELIEVE HE WAS TALKING 

1315
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,039
ABOUT A FLIGHT ATTENDANT ON 

1316
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,508
THAT FLIGHT AND SHE STAND BY 

1317
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:04,808
HER STORY. 

1318
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:05,242
>> SHE DOES INDEED. 

1319
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,545
>> SO BUT I WANT TO GET FROM 

1320
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,182
YOU YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU TOOK 

1321
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,684
FROM THAT BECAUSE I THOUGHT TO 

1322
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,153
MYSELF OKAY I KNOW HE HAS SHADE 

1323
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:16,921
HE'SING THERE -- SAID THAT HE'S 

1324
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:17,687
WILLING TO LISTEN TO THE 

1325
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:19,323
VICTIMS BUT THAT WAS VERY 

1326
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,257
TELLING WHEN HE SAYS HIS POINT 

1327
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,859
OF VIEW ON THE ACCUSATIONS IS 

1328
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,395
INFORMED BY HIS OWN PERSONAL 

1329
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:24,728
EXPERIENCES. 

1330
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:26,530
AND WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1331
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,431
HAS NEVER ADMITTED TO ANY 

1332
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,833
WRONGDOING WHEN IT COMES TO 

1333
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:30,267
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 

1334
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,902
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU KNOW 

1335
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,671
WHAT I SHOULD CLARIFY -- 

1336
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,606
THERE'S THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD 

1337
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,707
TAPE THAT HE DID. 

1338
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,741
AGREE THERE WAS LOCKER ROOM 

1339
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:38,442
TALK AND THEN LATER THERE WAS 

1340
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,077
SOME REPORTING THAT HE EVEN 

1341
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,178
QUESTIONED THE AUTHENTICITY OF 

1342
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:43,113
THAT TAPE. 

1343
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,548
BUT GO AHEAD. 

1344
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,382
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 

1345
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:45,749
YES. 

1346
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:46,951
BUT YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I 

1347
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,553
THOUGHT THIS CONTEXT WAS SO 

1348
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:49,853
IMPORTANT. 

1349
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:50,754
BECAUSE WHEN HE HEARD PRESIDENT 

1350
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:52,556
TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE 

1351
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,891
KAVANAUGH ACCUSERS, YOU ARE 

1352
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,124
RIGHT. 

1353
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:55,693
IN THE BEGINNING, HE MADE CLEAR 

1354
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,827
HE WANTED THEM TO SPEAK. 

1355
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,096
HE WANTED TO HEAR THEIR STORY. 

1356
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,165
BUT THEN HE FLIP-FLOPPED AND AT 

1357
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,800
TIMES SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE 

1358
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,033
LYING. 

1359
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,236
AND HE WAS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT 

1360
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,406
YOU KNOW, HOW ANNOYING IT IS TO 

1361
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:10,507
ACCUSATIONS AND IT FELT VERY 

1362
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:10,941
PERSONAL. 

1363
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,243
NOT ONLY WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT 

1364
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,678
THIS, BUT ALSO WHEN HE TWEETED 

1365
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:14,945
ABOUT IT. 

1366
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,314
POINTING OUT THAT THE THIRD 

1367
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,250
ACCUSER IS REPRESENTED BY 

1368
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,650
MICHAEL AVENATTI. 

1369
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,186
WHO HE ALSO DUG INTO BECAUSE HE 

1370
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:25,022
SAID AVENATTI BROUGHT FALSE 

1371
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:25,756
CLAIMS AGAINST HIM. 

1372
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,757
AND SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT STORY 

1373
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,127
WE'RE REPORTING ON, WE WANT TO 

1374
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,228
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSON AT 

1375
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,063
THE CENTER OF IT WHO IS MAKING 

1376
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:33,697
CLAIMS ABOUT THE STORY AND IN 

1377
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,867
THIS CASE IT IS THE PRESIDENT. 

1378
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,036
AND BECAUSE IT FELT SO 

1379
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,303
PERSONAL, THAT'S WHY I PRESSED 

1380
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:41,906
HIM ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS 

1381
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,441
COMING FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCES 

1382
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,377
AND SURE ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH IT 

1383
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,010
TOOK GOADING, HE ACKNOWLEDGED 

1384
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,147
THAT YES, BECAUSE HE HAD GONE 

1385
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,249
THROUGH THIS HIMSELF. 

1386
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,150
HE SAID ABSOLUTELY. 

1387
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,786
THAT THIS IS GOING TO COLOR HIS 

1388
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,556
VIEW OF THESE ACCUSATIONS AND 

1389
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,391
HOW THE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 

1390
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:00,658
HANDLED. 

1391
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,027
>> AND YET, THROUGH THAT HOUR 

1392
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,060
AND 20 MINUTE PRESS CONFERENCE, 

1393
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,964
THERE, IF YOU READ THE TEE 

1394
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,633
LEAVES -- TEA LEAVES, THERE DID 

1395
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,636
APPEAR TO BE MOMENTS THROUGH 

1396
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,704
THE THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE 

1397
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:18,075
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO BE 

1398
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,009
INDICATING THAT PERHAPS BRETT 

1399
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,911
KAVANAUGH'S DEMEANOR IN THE FOX 

1400
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,646
NEWS INTERVIEW AND HE HASN'T 

1401
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,682
BEEN AS FORCEFUL AS THE 

1402
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,316
PRESIDENT HAS IN DENYING PAST 

1403
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,517
INSTANCES OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, 

1404
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,618
THERE WAS A LITTLE LIGHT AT THE 

1405
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,888
END OF THE TUNNEL IN THAT THE 

1406
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,223
PRESIDENT WOULD BE WILLING TO 

1407
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:34,558
JETTISON KAVANAUH DEPENDING 

1408
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,025
WHAT HE HEARS TODAY. 

1409
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,695
YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 

1410
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,228
REPUBLICANS SAYING FROM 

1411
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:38,929
McCONNELL TO GRAHAM SAYING THEY 

1412
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,966
WANT TO GET THIS DONE AND SEAT 

1413
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:42,966
HIM AS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 

1414
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:44,268
PRESIDENT SEEM TODAY OFFER A 

1415
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:44,802
LITTLE LIGHT THERE. 

1416
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,704
-- SEEMED TO OFFER A LITTLE 

1417
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,037
LIGHT THERE. 

1418
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,807
I WONDER IF YOU HAD THE SAME 

1419
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:50,007
TAKE. 

1420
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:50,441
>> Reporter: YEAH. 

1421
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,942
AND I THINK AFTER HE WAS 

1422
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,677
PRESSED ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES, 

1423
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,014
AND AFTER HE FELT THE MOUNTING 

1424
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:01,652
PRESSURE, AND HE YOU KNOW, 

1425
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:02,919
LISTENED TO AS YOU MENTIONED, 

1426
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,654
WHAT HIS FOLLOW REPUBLICANS 

1427
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:07,992
WERE SAYING, HE HAS TO LEAVE 

1428
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:08,425
SOME WIGGLE ROOM. 

1429
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:09,493
CAN'T COMPLETELY SHUT THE DOOR 

1430
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:10,928
BECAUSE THAT'S PERCEIVED IN A 

1431
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,562
CERTAIN WAY HE DOESN'T WANT 

1432
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:13,063
EITHER. 

1433
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,330
SO EVEN THOUGH HE IS COUCHING 

1434
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,400
HIS WORDS VERY CAREFULLY, IN 

1435
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,701
SAYING HE BELIEVES THAT THEY 

1436
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,504
ARE PROBABLY FALSE, HE ALSO 

1437
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:24,875
SAID HE'S WILLING TO LISTEN AND 

1438
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,011
HE MIGHT BE EVEN PERSUADE TODAY 

1439
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:27,711
CHANGE HIS MIND. 

1440
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,446
-- PERSUADED TO CHANGE HIS 

1441
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:29,646
MIND. 

1442
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:30,848
HE COULD BE PERSUADED AND HE 

1443
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,984
WILL BE WATCHING THIS HEARING 

1444
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:34,351
VERY CAREFULLY. 

1445
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,619
BECAUSE WHO KNOWS HE SAYS, 

1446
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,688
PERHAPS DR. FORD WILL SAY 

1447
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,025
SOMETHING INTERESTING. 

1448
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,325
AND YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT 

1449
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:42,659
PERFORMANCE. 

1450
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:44,662
BANKRUPT WE KNOW -- PRESIDENT 

1451
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,863
TRUMP WE KNOW REALLY VALUES 

1452
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,933
SOMETHING'S CHARACTER BASED ON 

1453
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:49,366
THEIR PERFORMANCE. 

1454
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,969
NOT ALWAYS THE SUBSTANCE OF 

1455
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:52,870
WHAT THEY CAN DELIVER. 

1456
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,139
BUT HOW THEY PERFORM UNDER 

1457
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:55,406
PRESSURE. 

1458
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:55,973
ESPECIALLY ON TELEVISION. 

1459
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:56,640
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE DOES 

1460
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,009
ALL DAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1461
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,811
HE WATCHES A LOT OF TV. 

1462
00:43:01,811 --> 00:43:04,181
AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN SOME OF 

1463
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,116
HIS AIDES PERFORM WELL THEY GET 

1464
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,283
A PHONE CALL SAYING SO MUCH AND 

1465
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:09,053
CONGRATULATIONS YOU DID A GREAT 

1466
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:09,253
JOB. 

1467
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,022
THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE TOO. 

1468
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,824
THAT WHEN HE BELIEVES SOMEONE 

1469
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,360
IS ON SCREEN AND NOT 

1470
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,194
REPRESENTING HIM AND HIS 

1471
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,029
ADMINISTRATION IN THIS CASE HIS 

1472
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,431
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, THE WAY 

1473
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,965
HE WANTS IT TO HAPPEN, HE 

1474
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:23,200
DOESN'T HESITATE TO SAY YOU 

1475
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,800
COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. 

1476
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,302
YOU DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB. 

1477
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:26,503
SO THAT'S I THINK WHAT HE'S 

1478
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,606
GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR AND OF 

1479
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,241
COURSE WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH 

1480
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,177
CRITICISM AGAINST KAVANAUGH FOR 

1481
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,411
HIS FOX NEWS INTERVIEW. 

1482
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,578
IN WHICH HE WAS VERY ROBOTIC. 

1483
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:38,048
AND YOU KNOW, HE SEEMED TO JUST 

1484
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,783
HAVE A FEW LINES OF MESSAGING 

1485
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:43,787
THAT HE REPEATED OVER AND OVER 

1486
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,054
AND OVER. 

1487
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:44,688
REGARDLESS OF THE QUESTION. 

1488
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,824
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 

1489
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,225
CAREFULLY WATCH KAVANAUGH TO 

1490
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:51,762
SEE WHETHER HE'S ABLE TO PAINT 

1491
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,364
A VERY SINCERE PICTURE AND BE 

1492
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:58,368
MORE CREDIBLE THAN DR. FORD. 

1493
00:43:58,368 --> 00:43:59,002
>> WELL, YOUR PERSISTENCE IN 

1494
00:43:59,002 --> 00:43:59,602
QUESTIONING THE PRESIDENT OF 

1495
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:01,004
THE UNITED STATES WAS IN THE 

1496
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:03,039
VERY BEST TRADITIONS OF CBS 

1497
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:03,907

1498
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,909
AND YOU GOT THE ANSWER TO THE 

1499
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,277
QUESTION THAT ACTUALLY MADE 

1500
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:07,477
NEWS. 

1501
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:09,446
SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR 

1502
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,481
REPORTING.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1504
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:11,915
>> Reporter: THANK YOU. 

1505
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,684
>>> WELL, TODAY'S HEARING IS 

1506
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,053
DRAWING STRONG PARALLELS TO 

1507
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:16,786
ANOTHER HIGH-PROFILE TESTIMONY. 

1508
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:17,821
IN 1991, ANITA HILL A PROFESSOR 

1509
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,057
WHO HAD WORKED WITH THE SUPREME 

1510

COURT NOMINEE CLARENCE THOMAS 

1511
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:23,293
HARASSMENT. 

1512
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,695
>> HILL TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF 

1513
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:27,030
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

1514
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,365
ABOUT HER CLAIMS. 

1515
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,333
NOW 27 YEARS LATER, CHRISTINE 

1516
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,201
BLASEY FORD'S ALLEGATION 

1517
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,102
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH BRING 

1518
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,705
HER TO THAT SAME BUILDING TO BE 

1519
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,940
QUESTIONED BY SOME OF THE SAME 

1520
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,811
SENATORS SO LET'S BRING IN 

1521
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:41,544
JESSICA LEVINSON A PROFESSOR AT 

1522
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:44,681
LOYOLA HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS 

1523
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:44,948
ANGELES. 

1524
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:45,949
LISTEN ONE OF THE MAIN 

1525
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:46,550
DIFFERENTS WITH THE HILL 

1526
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,684
HEARING AND TODAY -- 

1527
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:48,785
DIFFERENCES WITH THE HILL 

1528
00:44:48,785 --> 00:44:51,088
HEARING AND TODAY'S HEARING IS 

1529
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,923
THAT IT'S HAPPENING IN THE WAKE 

1530
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,024
OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT. 

1531
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,125
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL 

1532
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,561
IMPACT OR HELP OR HURT DR. 

1533
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:57,761
FORD? 

1534
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:58,962
>> I THINK IT'S HELPED C. FORD 

1535
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,397
IN THIS SENSE THAT -- DR. FORD 

1536
00:45:01,397 --> 00:45:02,132
IN THE SENSE THAT THE SENATORS 

1537
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,968
UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TO DO 

1538
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:05,869
SOMETHING AND I THINK THE 

1539
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,469
INCLINATION FOR MANY OF THE 

1540
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:07,971
REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN THE WAKE 

1541
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,406
OF THE ACCUSATIONS IS THAT THEY 

1542
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,040
DIDN'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING. 

1543
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,342
THEY WANTED TO HAVE BRETT 

1544
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:12,809
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED. 

1545
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,278
THEY SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO 

1546
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,011
AVOID WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. 

1547
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:17,514
WHICH IS WALL TO WALL HEADLINES 

1548
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,783
OF SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 

1549
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:20,751
KAVANAUGH AND THE WORDS "SEXUAL 

1550
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,018
ASSAULT." 

1551
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,919
SO CLOSE TO THE MIDTERM 

1552
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:23,219
ELECTIONS. 

1553
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:24,354
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THEY 

1554
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:24,588
WANTED. 

1555
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,757
AND SO THE #METOO MOVEMENT YOU 

1556
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,593
THINK HAS REALLY FORCED THE 

1557
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:30,227
REPUBLICANS' HANDS IN ASKING 

1558
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,328
THEM TO AT LEAST GIVE A 

1559
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:31,595
HEARING. 

1560
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,164
BUT IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT 

1561
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,199
DEEPER, THE #METOO MOVEMENT 

1562
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,800
CLEARLY DOES HAVE ITS LIMITS 

1563
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,834
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HEARING 

1564
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:41,338
THAT'S NOT SET UP IN ANY WAY AS 

1565
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,406
A TRUE FACT FINDING MISSION. 

1566
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:45,709
AND WE HAVE HEARING THAT IS 

1567
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:46,410
PITTED STRUCTURALLY DESIGNED, 

1568
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,512
SO THAT IT'S HE SAID, SHE SAID. 

1569
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,746
WHEN IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO 

1570
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,113
BE THAT WAY. 

1571
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:51,782
SO WE ALSO SEE IN THE COMMENTS 

1572
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,383
OF MANY OF THE SENATORS A 

1573
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,018
DISCONNECT BETWEEN ME TOO AND 

1574
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,086
OUR REPRESENTATIVES. 

1575
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,288
>> IT'S A GOOD POINT JESSICA. 

1576
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,089
AND WHEN ANITA HILL TESTIFIED 

1577
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,392
IN 1991, I WANT TO PLAY A 

1578
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,660
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT SHE SAID HAD 

1579
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,060
BEEN HER CLAIMS. 

1580
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,929
>> I GUESS -- ABOUT HER CLAIMS. 

1581
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,731
>> I GUESS ONE REALLY DOES HAVE 

1582
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,967
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT 

1583
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,034
THE NATURE OF SEXUAL 

1584
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,603
HARASSMENT. 

1585
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,704
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE 

1586
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,707
TO COME FORWARD WITH THESE 

1587
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,207
THINGS. 

1588
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,643
>> SO NOW THREE WOMEN HAVE GONE 

1589
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,678
THROUGH WHAT DR. HILL CALLED 

1590
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,914
THE DIFFICULTY AND SHE MENTIONS 

1591
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,647
WITH THEIR CLAIMS OF ASSAULT 

1592
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:26,082
AGAINST JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH 

1593
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:28,652
AND WE JUST LEARNED THAT HE WAS 

1594
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,753
QUESTIONED ABOUT TWO OTHER 

1595
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,421
ALLEGATIONS AS WELL. 

1596
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,356
OBVIOUSLY THE NUMBER OF 

1597
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:32,990
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST-AND-A-HALF 

1598
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,392
IS A MAY -- KAVANAUGH IS A 

1599
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,693
MAJOR DIFFERENCE WITH TODAY'S 

1600
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,328
HEAR ASKING THE ONE IN 199 -- 

1601
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,230
HEARING AND THE ONE IN 1991. 

1602
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,334
DO YOU THINK IF OTHER WOMEN HAD 

1603
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,702
MADE THE PUBLIC CLAIM AGAINST 

1604
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:46,269
CLARENCE THOMAS TESTIMONY. 

1605
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:47,804
IT WOULD HAVE GONE THE SAME 

1606
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,037
WAY? 

1607
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:48,438
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

1608
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,239
I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 

1609
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,775
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF KEY 

1610
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,076
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 

1611
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:53,676
CLARENCE THOMAS SITUATION AND 

1612
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:55,479
THE JUDGE KAVANAUGH SITUATION. 

1613
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,747
SO FOR INSTANCE, WITH CLARENCE 

1614
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,848
THOMAS, WHAT WE'RE TALKING 

1615
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,884
ABOUT IS YOU HEARD ANITA HILL 

1616
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:01,518
SAY, WAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 

1617
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,419
NOT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I THINK 

1618
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,389
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TREAT 

1619
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:05,822
THOSE DIFFERENTLY. 

1620
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,624
WE WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT 

1621
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,026
ADULTS WHICH CHANGES THE 

1622
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,028
CALCULUS IN BOTH WAYS AND ON 

1623
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,729
ONE HAND WE DON'T HAVE AS 

1624
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:13,163
VULNERABLE VICTIM. 

1625
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,531
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE 

1626
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,266
SOMEONE WHO WE'RE NOT TALKING 

1627
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:16,733
ABOUT A 17-YEAR-OLD. 

1628
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,568
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE CASE 

1629
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:21,672
OF JUSTICE THOMAS, AN ADULT IN 

1630
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,438
THE MIDDLE OF HIS CAREER. 

1631
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:24,308
WHO'S ACCUSED OF THESE 

1632
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:24,741
PARTICULAR CRIMES. 

1633
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,010
SO THE MORE PEOPLE HAD COME 

1634
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,745
FORWARD, WOULD IT HAVE MADE A 

1635
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,715
DIFFERENCE FOR THE CLARENCE 

1636
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:32,382
THOMAS CONFIRMATION? 

1637
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,117
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE. 

1638
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,987
IN THIS CASE, WHEN WITH JUDGE

ASSAULT WHICH IS A LOT MORE 

1643
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,529
SERIOUS THAN SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

1644
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,197
OR FOR ACCUSATIONS THAT 

1645
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:47,831

>> CIRCUMSTANCES BROUGHT IT OUT 

1829
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:16,979
THAT WAY. 

1830
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:19,349
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED 

1831
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,350
A LONG TIME AGO. 

1832
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,220
AND IT'S NOT THAT I JUST ABOUT 

1833
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,855
IT. 

1834
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:26,923
IT'S -- THOUGHT ABOUT IT. 

1835
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:27,924
IT'S BEEN ON MY MIDNIGHT -- 

1836
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:28,425
MIND EVER SINCE THE 

1837
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:28,792
OCCURRENCES. 

1838
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,526
AS FAR AS IT GOES BRETT 

1839
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:30,427
KAVANAUGH IS GOING FOR A SEAT 

1840
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,861
WHERE HE'S GOING TO HAVE THAT 

1841
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,097
SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR 

1842
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,031
THE REST OF HIS LIFE. 

1843
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:38,168
AND IF HE'S GOING TO HAVE THAT 

1844
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,669
SEAT LEGITIMATELY, ALL THE 

1845
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,603
THINGS SHOULD BE EVACUATED. 

1846
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,237
>> ALL RIGHT -- INVESTIGATED. 

1847
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,605
>> ALL RIGHT SO CAITLIN BEFORE 

1848
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,008
WE GO TO ANITA, IN LISTENING TO 

1849
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,010
THAT MOMENT TO THAT SOUNDBYTE, 

1850
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,680
IT DID STRIKE ME THAT IT'S A 

1851
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:50,980
BRIEF CLIP. 

1852
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,682
BUT SHE DID SOUND PARTISAN. 

1853
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:54,316
THESE ALLEGATIONS MAY BE TRUE, 

1854
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:55,484
BUT I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 

1855
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:58,621
THEY'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO THAT 

1856
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,322
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WELL 

1857
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,658
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE AN 

1858
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:01,958
APOGEAN DA. 

1859
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:02,425
YOU HAVE -- AGENDA. 

1860
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,526
YOU HAVE WORKED IN GOVERNMENT 

1861
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,828
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, YOU WHO 

1862
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,729
LEFT THE WASHINGTON BUBBLE AND 

1863
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:07,162
SHE WENT FAR AWAY. 

1864
00:56:07,162 --> 00:56:08,865
SHE SAYS IN PART BECAUSE OF 

1865
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,065
THIS. 

1866
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,600
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO ACCORDING 

1867
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,835
TO THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT HAS 

1868
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,236
SPENT YEARS IN THE GOVERNMENT. 

1869
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,638
SO PRESUMABLY SHE WOULD HAVE 

1870
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,674
TRACKED BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

1871
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:21,611
CAREER ASK HIS RISE IN 

1872
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:22,144
WASHINGTON JURISPRUDENCE. 

1873
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:24,747
DID YOU GET THE SAME TAKE? 

1874
00:56:24,747 --> 00:56:28,318
>> IT ALREADY HAS BEEN AND 

1875
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,853
ESPECIALLY SINCE MICHAEL AVENUE 

1876
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:34,023
IN THE TEE IS HER ATTORNEY -- 

1877
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,859
AVENATTI IS HER ATTORNEY HERE. 

1878
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,360
BECAUSE HE IS POTENTIALLY A 

1879
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,194
2020 PRESIDENTIAL CONTUNDER. 

1880
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:38,895
HE'S BEEN MAKING THE STOPS TO 

1881
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,231
THE EARLY STATES AND BEEN 

1882
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,532
INVOLVING HIMSELF IN THE 

1883
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,168
POLITICAL CIRCUS TO BORROW FROM 

1884
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,702
THE TITLE OF THAT CLIP THERE. 

1885
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:48,805
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT TOO IS 

1886
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:53,643
THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO KNOWS 

1887
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:55,778
THE PENALTY FOR PRESENTING THIS 

1888
00:56:55,778 --> 00:56:58,615
INFORMATION IN A SWORN LEGAL 

1889
00:56:58,615 --> 00:56:58,882
DOCUMENT. 

1890
00:56:58,882 --> 00:56:59,449
KNOWS WHAT THE PENALTY FOR 

1891
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,851
PERJURY WOULD BE IN THAT CASE. 

1892
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:04,387
GIVEN HER CIRCUMSTANCE AND HER 

1893
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:04,654
HISTORY. 

1894
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:05,588
NOW WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING 

1895
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,257
TO ME IS AND THE BIGGEST 

1896
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,591
QUESTION I HAVE HEADING INTO 

1897
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,627
THERE SPECIFIC HEARING WHICH IS 

1898
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,162
ABOUT FORD AND KAVANAUGH, IS 

1899
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,697
HOW PERSUADABLE IS THE AMERICAN 

1900
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:14,931
PUBLIC? 

1901
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,601
AND HOW PERSUADABLE ARE THE 

1902
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,906
MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE? 

1903
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,774
AND REALLY INTERESTING POLL 

1904
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,175
FROM NPR THAT CAME OUT 

1905
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:27,710
YESTERDAY SAYS LOT OF PEOPLE 

1906
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,647
HAVE REALLY MADE UP THEIR MINDS 

1907
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:30,947
ABOUT THIS. 

1908
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,782
9% OF REPUBLICAN -- 59% OF 

1909
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,083
REPUBLICANS SAYING THEY BELIEVE 

1910
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,018
KAVANAUGH AND 50% OF DEMOCRATS 

1911
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,619
SAYING THEY BELIEVE FORD AND 

1912
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,088
WHAT REALLY STUCK OUT TO ME IS 

1913
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,857
A # 4% OF REPUBLICAN -- 54% OF 

1914
00:57:41,857 --> 00:57:43,760
REPUBLICANS SAY EVEN IF THE 

1915
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,327
ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE, THEY 

1916
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,895
STILL THINK HE COULD BE 

1917
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:46,195
CONFIRMED. 

1918
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:47,030
WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 

1919
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,367
WE ARE JUST SIX WEEKS AWAY FROM 

1920
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,602
THE MID TEMPLE ELECTION AND 

1921
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,703
POLITICS IS HOVERING OVER ALL 

1922
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:54,003
OF THIS. 

1923
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,639
>> YOU WERE AT THE PRESIDENT'S 

1924
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,206
PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY. 

1925
00:57:57,206 --> 00:57:59,876
ANITA, HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE 

1926
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:00,677
ALLEGATION BUT HE DID TALK 

1927
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,211
ABOUT THE WOMEN SPECIFICALLY 

1928
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:04,948
BUT SORT OF THE CLOUD AT THE 

1929
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,950
ALLEGATIONS HAVE SORT OF 

1930
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,684
PRESENTED ON THIS CONFIRMATION 

1931
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:07,951
HEARING. 

1932
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,886
JUST TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE 

1933
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:10,119
SAID. 

1934
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,956
>> I ONLY TELL YOU THIS, THIS 

1935
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,490
IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY 

1936
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,060
PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER MET. 

1937
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,627
AND EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS HIM 

1938
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:21,598
SAYS THE SAME THING. 

1939
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:25,000
AND THESE ARE ALL FALSE TO ME. 

1940
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,637
THESE ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND 

1941
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,073
CERTAIN CASES AND CERTAIN CASES 

1942
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,207
EVEN THE MEDIA AGREES WITH 

1943
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:31,407
THAT. 

1944
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,209
>> ALL RIGHT SO EARLIER IN THE 

1945
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,644
WEEK, OR EARLIER WE HEARD HIM 

1946
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,480
SAY YOU GOT TO LET HER TALK. 

1947
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,915
CLEARLY BY YESTERDAY, THE 

1948
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:41,217
PRESIDENT WAS YOU KNOW, CLEARLY 

1949
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,051
INDICATING THAT HE DIDN'T 

1950
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,319
BELIEVE WHAT THE WOMEN HAD TO 

1951
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:44,520
SAY. 

1952
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,922
CERTAINLY WHAT BLASEY FORD HAS 

1953
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:46,155
TO SAY. 

1954
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,657
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE 

1955
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,593
ON WHAT THE PRESIDENT HOW HE 

1956
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,026
PRESENTED HIMSELF? 

1957
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:52,829
>> SUREMENT I MEAN, HE'S -- THE 

1958
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,530
PRESIDENT HAS SLOWLY CHANGED 

1959
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,499
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS RIGHT? 

1960
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,734
HE WAS VERY RESERVED. 

1961
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,402
THE FIRST FEW DAYS AND HIS 

1962
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,002
ADVISORS WERE TELLING HIM TO 

1963
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:02,005
KIND OF STAY OUT OF THINGS AND 

1964
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,841
LET IT PROCEED ON THE HILL. 

1965
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,376
LET SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL 

1966
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,677
SORT OF TAKE THE LEAD AND JUST 

1967
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:08,411
SORT OF STAY OUT. 

1968
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,012
BUT AS SOON AS HE LEFT 

1969
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:13,750
WASHINGTON, AND HIT THE ROAD 

1970
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,550
FOR A POLITICAL SWING THROUGH 

1971
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,986
LAS VEGAS AND MISSOURI, YOU SAW 

1972
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,054
THAT HIS TUNE CHANGED RIGHT? 

1973
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,088
HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW HE 

1974
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,791
REALLY FELT LIKE THIS NEEDED TO 

1975
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:22,057
HURRY UP. 

1976
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:23,726
THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE DR. 

1977
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,261
FORD OR AT LEAST WAS SKEPTICAL 

1978
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:25,862
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID. 

1979
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,030
AND THEN WE'VE SEEN HIM SORT OF 

1980
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,998
ESCALATE OVER THE LAST FEW 

1981
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:30,199
DAYS. 

1982
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,769
HE'S PRETTY ANGRY AT HOW LONG 

1983
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:33,870
THIS HAS TAKING -- MISS TAKING 

1984
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,471
AND YOU -- THIS IS TAKING AND 

1985
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:36,873
YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT 

1986
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,207
YESTERDAY THAT THE SENATE IS 

1987
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:38,808
TAKING TOO LONG. 

1988
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:39,942
THEY SHOULD HAVE HUDRIED UP AND 

1989
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,244
HAD THE -- HURRIED UP AND HAD 

1990
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,679
THE HEARING AND HURRY UP AND 

1991
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:42,979
VOTE. 

1992
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,480
WHAT -- YOU KNOW CAITLIN 

1993
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,648
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, WHAT'S 

1994
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:46,916
REALLY HANGING OVER HIM IS THAT 

1995
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,951
HE NEEDS TO GET THIS DONE. 

1996
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,186
THE SUPREME COURT NEW TERM 

1997
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,520
STARTS ON MONDAY. 

1998
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,657
HE HAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE A 

1999
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,692
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE CONFIRMED 

2000
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:55,992
BY MONDAY. 

2001
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:57,226
SO YOU KNOW, THAT'S A PROMISE 

2002
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,828
THAT HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE TO 

2003
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:01,464
PUT A CONSERVATIVE ON THE 

2004
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:01,697
COURT. 

2005
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:02,264
A VERY IMPORTANT POSITION. 

2006
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:04,200
THIS NINTH SEAT. 

2007
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,536
AND ALSO YOU KNOW THE MIDTERMS 

2008
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:07,737
ARE JUST WEEKS AWAY HERE. 

2009
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:20,717
IF 

2010
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:21,917
>>> IT'S WEIGHING ON HIM 

2011
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:26,489
HEAVILY. 

2012
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,423
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPACT 

2013
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:34,930
ON THE MIDTERMS AS THIS HEARING 

2014
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,133
HAS UNFOLDED. 

2015
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,169
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A 

2016
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:40,703
REALLY GOOD POINT. 

2017
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:42,605
IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE 

2018
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,640
REPUBLICANS HAVE ALREADY 

2019
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,775
DECIDED WHERE THEY STAND ON 

2020
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,809
THIS, AND PRESUMABLY DEMOCRATS 

2021
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,609
HAVE, AS WELL. 

2022
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:49,412
SENATORS ARE WATCHING THE 

2023
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,414
TESTIMONY AND LISTENING TO THE 

2024
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,049
TESTIMONY FOR ONE THING BUT 

2025
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,784
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE EVERYONE 

2026
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:55,851
ELSE WILL BE OBSERVING? 

2027
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:57,587
>> WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER 

2028
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,921
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 

2029
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,356
THAT WE ARE SEEING FORD IN 

2030
01:01:01,356 --> 01:01:01,858
PERSON. 

2031
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,993
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMAGES 

2032
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,194
FROM THE HEARING ROOM, LOOK HOW 

2033
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,396
INTIMATE IT IS. 

2034
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,232
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO COME IN 

2035
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,867
FRONT OF CAMERAS, EVEN THOUGH 

2036
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,302
THERE ARE ONLY THREE CAMERAS, 

2037
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:16,005
TO COME IN FRONT OF THEM, ONE 

2038
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,840
OF THE MOST POWERFUL COMMITTEES 

2039
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,010
IN THE SENATE AND ALSO TO HAVE 

2040
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,780
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE 

2041
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,314
COUNTRY EITHER WATCHING LIVE OR 

2042
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:26,916
SEEING THESE IMAGES AND HER 

2043
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,551
ACTUAL TESTIMONY DISSEMINATED 

2044
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,153
ACROSS IN BYTES AND THEY WILL 

2045
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:30,386
SEE IT. 

2046
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,421
EVEN IF SHE JUST REPEATS WHAT 

2047
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:34,223
SHE HAS TOLD THE WASHINGTON 

2048
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:38,694
POST OR WHAT WE SAW IN HER 

2049
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:39,562
TESTIMONY THAT HASN'T BEEN 

2050
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:40,229
RELEASED ALREADY, HER PREPARED 

2051
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:43,399
REMARKS, THAT IMAGE AND PUTTING 

2052
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:46,002
THESE ALLEGATIONS TO A FACE AND 

2053
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,504
TO A PERSON, COULD BE PERSUASIVE

2054
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,007
AMONG SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 

2055
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:54,210
WAITING TO HEAR FROM HER. 

2056
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,511
REPUBLICANS, HOWEVER, THEY FEEL 

2057
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:56,612
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT, 

2058
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,847
FROM STRATEGIST AND OPERATIVES 

2059
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:59,715
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ON THE 

2060
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:01,850
CAMPAIGN FRONT, THEY FEEL IF 

2061
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,220
THEY DON'T GET KAVANAUGH 

2062
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,322
CONFIRM NOW OR QUICKLY, THERE 

2063
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:07,390
WILL BE A BACKLASH AGAINST 

2064
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,324
REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERM 

2065
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,692
ELECTIONS AND THAT THEIR OWN 

2066
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,927
VOTERS WILL FEEL LIKE 

2067
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,595
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO 

2068
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,697
STAND UP FOR THIS NOMINEE AND 

2069
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,700
BECAUSE AS ANITA SAID, THIS IS 

2070
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,969
THE SUPREME COURT, BUT THIS IS 

2071
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,538
A PIVOTAL SEAT THAT COULD 

2072
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:23,906
CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF THE 

2073
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:24,773
SUPREME COURT FOR A GENERATION 

2074
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:27,009
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 

2075
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:31,013
REALLY ON TOP OF MIND AMONG 

2076
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:31,246
THESE. 

2077
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:33,349
>> LET'S RESET ON TOP OF THE 

2078
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:33,582
HOUR. 

2079
01:02:33,582 --> 01:02:35,251
YOU SEE WITH THE CAMERA IS 

2080
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,119
POSITIONED TO VIEW RIGHT NOW. 

2081
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,854
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS 

2082
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:40,156
SET TO APPEAR BEFORE THE SENATE 

2083
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,657
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND ALMOST 

2084
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:45,027
ALL THE SENATORS ARE ALREADY IN 

2085
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,895
THE COMMITTEE BRIEFING ROOM AND 

2086
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:49,332
SHE IS SET TO TESTIFY AGAINST 

2087
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,033
HER ACCUSATION THAT JUDGE BRETT 

2088
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,702
KAVANAUGH, TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT

2089
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,170
NOMINEE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER 

2090
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,671
AND YOU SEE HER SEATED THERE 

2091
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:56,004
RIGHT NOW. 

2092
01:02:56,004 --> 01:02:58,207
JUST BEFORE WE WATCH THIS 

2093
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,909
HEARING TAKE PLACE, I WANT TO 

2094
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,677
LET THE VIEWERS KNOW THAT I'M 

2095
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,280
SURE THIS TESTIMONY, FOR WOMEN 

2096
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,748
AND PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED SEXUAL 

2097
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,250
ASSAULT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT 

2098
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:07,816
TO WATCH. 

2099
01:03:07,816 --> 01:03:09,952
YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL THE NATIONAL

2100
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,256
SEXUAL ASSAULT HOTLINE, THEY ARE

2101
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,625
OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY IN THE 

2102
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,493
NUMBER IS 1-800 -- 1-800-656-

2103
01:03:18,493 --> 01:03:24,400
4673 AS WE PREPARE TO WATCH DR. 

2104
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,434
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WITH HER 

2105
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:25,834
OPENING CEREMONY. 

2106
01:03:25,834 --> 01:03:27,436
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND LET'S SEE 

2107
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:43,552
IF WE CAN LISTEN IN. 

2108
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:44,754
SHE IS CLEARLY GETTING READY TO 

2109
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:45,921
BEGIN HER TESTIMONY AND I SEE 

2110
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:47,056
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY IS ALREADY IN 

2111
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:49,125
THE ROOM AND WILL GAVEL IN 

2112
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:49,392
SHORTLY. 

2113
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:50,660
>> MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF 

2114
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:58,634
COMPARING THIS TO THE ANITA 

2115
01:03:58,634 --> 01:03:59,435
HILL TESTIMONY. 

2116
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:03,005
MUCH HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT HOW 

2117
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,340
LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN 27 YEARS. 

2118
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,577
ANITA HILL DID AN OP-ED, 

2119
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:09,912
BASICALLY SAYING THAT IN THE 

2120
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:10,813
CASE OF HER TESTIMONY. 

2121
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:11,413
CLARENCE THOMAS TESTIFIED 

2122
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:14,183
BEFORE HER AND AFTER HER AND 

2123
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,752
SHE WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE. 

2124
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,221
IN A WAY, THIS IS SOMEWHAT 

2125
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:20,022
SIMILAR. 

2126
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,524
WE'VE HEARD FROM JUDGE 

2127
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,025
KAVANAUGH, HE HAD TWO DAYS OF 

2128
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,260
HEARINGS AND WAS GRILLED ABOUT 

2129
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,195
SOME SORT OF ACCUSATIONS AND WE 

2130
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,163
DIDN'T KNOW THE DETAILS AT THE 

2131
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:28,364
TIME. 

2132
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,865
KAMALA HARRIS BROUGHT UP 

2133
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:31,867
SOMETHING THAT LEFT US 

2134
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,569
SCRATCHING OUR HEADS AMIN FOUND 

2135
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,403
OUT LATER. 

2136
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,206
HE WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK AFTER 

2137
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,908
HER AND MUCH IN A SIMILAR WAY. 

2138
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:42,511
IT CERTAINLY DOES SEEM LIKE THE 

2139
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,780
SENATE COMMITTEE HAS NOT 

2140
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,715
DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO HANDLE 

2141
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,349
THESE SORTS OF ALLEGATIONS. 

2142
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:46,749
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

2143
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:50,586
>>> THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE 

2144
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,021
BRETT KAVANAUGH TO SERVE AS 

2145
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,189
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ON OUR 

2146
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:59,629
SUPREME COURT AND WE WILL HEAR 

2147
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:00,296
FROM TWO WITNESSES, DR. 

2148
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:01,297
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORWARD AND 

2149
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,133
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

2150
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:04,900
THANKS, OF COURSE, TO DR. FORD 

2151
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,603
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH FOR 

2152
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,137
ACCEPTING OUR COMMITTEE'S 

2153
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:16,479
INVITATION TO TESTIFY AND ALSO 

2154
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,079
THANKING THEM TO VOLUNTEER 

2155
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,114
BEFORE HE TESTIFIED BEFORE WE 

2156
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:18,881
EVEN INVITED THEM. 

2157
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,250
BOTH DR. FORD AND JUDGE 

2158
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,184
KAVANAUGH HAVE BEEN THROUGH A 

2159
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:30,993
TERRIBLE COUPLE OF WEEKS. 

2160
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:31,894
THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE 

2161
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:32,794
RECEIVED VIOLENT THREATS. 

2162
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:33,930
WHAT THEY HAVE ENDURED OUGHT TO 

2163
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,363
BE CONSIDERED BY ALL OF US AS 

2164
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:37,133
UNACCEPTABLE AND A POOR 

2165
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:45,741
REFLECTION ON THE STATE OF 

2166
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:46,609
CIVILITY IN OUR DEMOCRACY. 

2167
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,777
SO, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU 

2168
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,378
BOTH FOR THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN 

2169
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,181
TREATED AND I INTEND, 

2170
01:05:52,181 --> 01:06:00,656
HOPEFULLY, FOR TODAY'S HEARING 

2171
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:01,657
TO BE SAFE, COMFORTABLE AND 

2172
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:02,391
DIGNIFIED FOR BOTH OF OUR 

2173
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:02,691
WITNESSES. 

2174
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:03,792
I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN 

2175
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:07,763

2176
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:08,030
CIVILITY. 

2177
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,298
WITH THAT SAID, I LAMENT THAT 

2178
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:15,504

2179
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,908

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 

2190
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:40,596
THE PRESIDENT ADDED JUDGE

2193
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:52,541
THAN NINE MONTHS AGO. 

2194
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,744
IT WAS NOVEMBER, 2017 AND AS 

2195
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:55,477

SINCE 1993, 25 YEARS AGO. 

2201
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:11,693
NOWHERE IN ANY OF THESE SIX FBI 

2202
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:17,199
REPORTS, WHICH COMMITTEE 

2203
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE REVIEWED ON 

2204
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,868
A BIPARTISAN BASIS, WAS THERE A 

2205
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:23,906
WHIFF OF ANY ISSUE -- ANY ISSUE 

2206
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,841
AT ALL -- RELATED IN ANY WAY TO 

2207
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:29,745
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR. 

2208
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:30,779
DR. FORD FIRST RAISED HER 

2209
01:07:30,779 --> 01:07:39,221
ALLEGATIONS IN A SECRET LETTER 

2210
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,322
TO THE RANKING MEMBER NEARLY 

2211
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:40,855
TWO MONTHS AGO, IN JULY. 

2212
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:44,160
THIS LETTER WAS SECRET FROM 

2213
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:52,901

2215
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,003
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT. 

2216
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:57,373
THE RANKING MEMBER TOOK NO 

2217
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:57,606
ACTION. 

2218
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:58,307
THE LETTER WASN'T SHARED WITH 

2219
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:05,314
ME OUR COLLEAGUES OR MY STAFF. 

2220
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:05,981
THESE ALLEGATIONS COULD HAVE 

2221
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,049
BEEN INVESTIGATED IN A WAY THAT 

2222
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:07,683
MAINTAINED THE CONFIDENTIALITY 

2223
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:16,591
THAT DR. FORD REQUESTED. 

2224
01:08:16,591 --> 01:08:17,526
BEFORE HIS HEARING, JUDGE 

2225
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,493

2226
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:19,862
SENATORS, INCLUDING THE RANKING 

2227
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,898
MEMBER. 

2228
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:23,933
THE RANKING MEMBER DIDN'T ASK 

2229
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:24,600
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ABOUT THE 

2230
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,434
ALLEGATIONS WHEN SHE MET WITH 

2231
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:30,773
HIM PRIVATELY IN AUGUST. THE 

2232
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,439
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HELD 

2233
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,241
ITS 4-DAY PUBLIC HEARING FROM 

2234
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:32,875

2236
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:42,451
MORE THAN 32 HOURS IN PUBLIC. 

2237
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,484
WE HELD A CLOSED SESSION FOR 

2238
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:47,055
MEMBERS TO ASK SENSITIVE 

2239
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:48,858
QUESTIONS ON THE LAST EVENING, 

2240
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:49,792
WHICH THE RANKING MEMBER DID 

2241
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,091
NOT ATTEND. 

2242
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:52,493
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ANSWERED NEARLY 

2243
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:53,495
1300 WRITTEN QUESTIONS 

2244
01:08:53,495 --> 01:08:55,330
SUBMITTED BY SENATORS AFTER THE 

2245
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:55,898
HEARING. 

2246
01:08:55,898 --> 01:09:00,903
IT'S MORE THAN ALL PRIOR 

2247
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:01,803
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. 

2248
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:05,274
THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD, HE DID 

2249
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:06,006
NOT KNOW ABOUT THE RANKING 

2250
01:09:06,006 --> 01:09:12,747
MEMBER'S SECRET EVIDENCE. 

2251
01:09:12,747 --> 01:09:13,948
THEN, ONLY AT AN 11TH HOUR ON 

2252
01:09:13,948 --> 01:09:14,917
THE EVE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

2253
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:15,684
CONFIRMATION VOTE, DID THE 

2254
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,921
RANKING MEMBER REFER THE 

2255
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,323
ALLEGATIONS TO THE FBI. 

2256
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,024
THEN, SADLY, THE ALLEGATIONS 

2257
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:22,924
WERE LEAKED TO THE PRESS AND 

2258
01:09:22,924 --> 01:09:26,528
THAT'S WHERE DR. FORD WAS 

2259
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:26,828
MISTREATED. 

2260
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:32,167
THIS IS A SHAMEFUL WAY TO TREAT 

2261
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,335
OUR WITNESS WHO INSISTED ON 

2262
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:37,740
CONFIDENTIALITY. 

2263
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,743
AND, OF COURSE, JUDGE 

2264
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,278
KAVANAUGH, WHO HAS HAD TO 

2265
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:48,183
ADDRESS THESE ALLEGATIONS IN 

2266
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:50,018
THE MIDST OF A MEDIA CIRCUS. 

2267
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:53,589
WHEN I RECEIVED DR. FORD'S 

2268
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,390
LETTER ON SEPTEMBER 13, MY 

2269
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,391
STAFF AND I RECOGNIZED THE 

2270
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:55,924
SERIOUSNESS OF THESE 

2271
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:56,925
ALLEGATIONS AND IMMEDIATELY 

2272
01:09:56,925 --> 01:10:02,564
BEGAN OUR COMMITTEE'S 

2273
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:03,465
INVESTIGATION CONSISTENT WITH 

2274
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:04,533
THE WAY THE COMMITTEE HAS 

2275
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,534
HANDLED SUCH ALLEGATIONS IN THE 

2276
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:05,734
PAST. 

2277
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:11,006
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, THE 

2278
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,374
DEMOCRATIC SIDE REFUSED TO 

2279
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,609
PARTICIPATE IN WHAT SHOULD HAVE 

2280
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:14,977
BEEN A BIPARTISAN 

2281
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:15,344
INVESTIGATION. 

2282
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,980
AS FAR AS I KNOW ON ALL OF THE 

2283
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,248
JUDGESHIPS THROUGHOUT AT LEAST 

2284
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,816
THE LAST THREE YEARS, THAT HAS 

2285
01:10:21,816 --> 01:10:23,919
BEEN THE WAY IT'S BEEN HANDLED. 

2286
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:24,520
AFTER DR. FORD'S IDENTITY 

2287
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,220
BECAME PBLIC, MY STAFF 

2288
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:32,161
CONTACTED ALL THE INDIVIDUALS 

2289
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:35,331
SHE SAID ATTENDED THE 1982 

2290
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:35,831
PARTY DESCRIBED IN THE 

2291
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:36,498
WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE. 

2292
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:37,099
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IMMEDIATELY 

2293
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:37,766
SUBMITTED TO AN INTERVIEW UNDER 

2294
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:38,533
PENALTY OF FELONY FOR ANY 

2295
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:45,607
KNOWINGLY FALSE STATEMENTS. 

2296
01:10:45,607 --> 01:10:46,575
HE DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS 

2297
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,543
CATEGORICALLY AND DEMOCRATIC 

2298
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,645
STAFF WAS INVITED TO 

2299
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:50,879
PARTICIPATE IN COULD HAVE ASKED 

2300
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,714
ANY QUESTIONS THEY WANTED TO. 

2301
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:52,081
THEY DECLINED. 

2302
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,017
THAT LEADS ME, THEN, TO WONDER 

2303
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,921
IF THEY ARE REALLY CONCERNED 

2304
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,790
WITH GOING TO THE TRUTH, WHY 

2305
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,258
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO TALK TO 

2306
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:03,591
THE ACCUSED? 

2307
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:04,426
THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURE IS 

2308
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,093
WHAT THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS DOES 

2309
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:13,469
WHEN WE RECEIVE ALLEGATIONS OF 

2310
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:13,769
WRONGDOING. 

2311
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,038
MY STAFF REACHED OUT TO OTHER 

2312
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,339
INDIVIDUALS ALLEGEDLY AT THE 

2313
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:18,107
PARTY, MARK JUDGE, PATRICK

THE SENATE UNDER PENALTY OF 

2317
01:11:20,675 --> 01:11:28,751
FELONY, DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE 

2318
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:29,418
OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED BY DR. 

2319
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:29,618
FORD. 

2320
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,586
DR. FORD'S LIFELONG FRIEND, MS. 

2321
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:37,893
KAISER STATED SHE DOESN'T KNOW 

2322
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:39,895
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND DOESN'T 

2323
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:42,431
RECALL EVER ATTENDING A PARTY 

2324
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:43,532
WITH HIM. 

2325
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:45,200
MY STAFF MADE REPEATED REQUESTS 

2326
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,503

HER TESTIMONY. 

2330
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,273
HER ATTORNEYS REFUSED TO

01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:52,307
PRESENT HER ALLEGATIONS TO

01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:06,821
OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT --

OATH. 

2339
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,924
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE JUDICIARY 

2340
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,726
COMMITTEE WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT 

2341
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,393
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS INTO 

2342
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:21,170

SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, 

2345
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:23,739
CONSISTENT WITH STATED DESIRES 

2346
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,373
TO OBSTRUCT KAVANAUGH'S 

2347
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:27,209

ALLEGATIONS. 

2351
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:37,786
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO FORCE

CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO A 

2354
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,026
MATTER IT CONSIDERS TO BE 

2355
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:44,259
CLOSED. 

2356
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:44,893
MOREOVER, ONCE THE ALLEGATIONS 

2357
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:46,094
BECAME PUBLIC, IT WAS EASY TO 

2358
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:46,627
IDENTIFY ALL THE ALLEGED 

2359
01:12:46,627 --> 01:12:54,169
WITNESSES AND CONDUCT OUR OWN 

2360
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:54,903
INVESTIGATIONS. 

2361
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,840
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS 

2362
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,007
BEEN LED TO BELIEVE, THE FBI 

2363
01:12:59,007 --> 01:12:59,842
DOESN'T PERFORM ANY CREDIBILITY 

2364
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,210
ASSESSMENTS OR VERIFY THE TRUTH 

2365
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,011
OF ANY EVENTS IN THESE 

2366
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,513
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. 

2367
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:15,357
I WILL QUOTE JOE BIDEN DURING 

2368
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,791
CLARENCE THOMAS' HEARING. 

2369
01:13:16,791 --> 01:13:17,558
THIS IS WHAT SENATOR BIDEN'S 

2370
01:13:17,558 --> 01:13:18,894
AND, QUOTE, THE NEXT PERSON WHO 

2371
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:24,733
REFERS TO AN FBI REPORT AS 

2372
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,367
BEING WORTH ANYTHING, OBVIOUSLY 

2373
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:25,967
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. 

2374
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:29,271
THE FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT, IN 

2375
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,639
THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE, REACH A 

2376
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,774
CONCLUSION, PERIOD. 

2377
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:43,852
THEY SAY HE SAID, SHE SAID, THEY

2378
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:46,154
SAID, PERIOD. 

2379
01:13:46,154 --> 01:13:47,990
SO, WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE THE FBI 

2380
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,124
REPORT BEFORE YOU, UNDERSTAND 

2381
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:50,626
THEY DO NOT -- THEY DO NOT -- 

2382
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:51,559
THEY DO NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS. 

2383
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:58,934
THEY DO NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS

2384
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,435
, AND OF SENATOR BIDEN'S QUOTE. 

2385
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:01,470
THE FBI PROVIDED US WITH THE 

2386
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:01,803
ALLEGATIONS. 

2387
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:05,540
NOW, IT'S UP TO THE SENATE TO 

2388
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,307
ASSESS THEIR CREDIBILITY. 

2389
01:14:06,307 --> 01:14:07,509
THAT BRINGS US TO THIS VERY 

2390
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:13,782
TIME. I 

2391
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,983
LOOK FORWARD TO A FAIR AND 

2392
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:15,784
RESPECTFUL HEARING AND THAT'S 

2393
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,517
WHAT WE'VE PROMISED DR. FORD. 

2394
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:17,319
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE 

2395
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,287
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 

2396
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:25,627
AN EXPERT ON THIS SIDE IS 

2397
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,596
INVESTIGATING SEX CRIMES AND 

2398
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,797
WILL BE QUESTIONING THE 

2399
01:14:29,797 --> 01:14:31,033
WITNESS. I 

2400
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:34,303
SEE NO BASIS FOR COMPLAINT, 

2401
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,939
OTHER THAN JUST PLAIN POLITICS. 

2402
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,374
THE TESTIMONY WE WILL HEAR 

2403
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,509
TODAY CONCERNS ALLEGATIONS OF 

2404
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:41,176
SEXUAL ASSAULT, VERY SERIOUS 

2405
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:41,509
ALLEGATIONS. 

2406
01:14:41,509 --> 01:14:42,143
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX 

2407
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:46,648
AND SENSITIVE SUBJECT TO 

2408
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:47,482
DISCUSS AND IT'S NOT AN EASY 

2409
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:48,182
ONE TO DISCUSS. 

2410
01:14:48,182 --> 01:14:48,984
THAT IS WHY THE SENATORS ON 

2411
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,552
THIS SIDE BELIEVE AN EXPERT WHO 

2412
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:57,926
HAS DEEP EXPERIENCE AND 

2413
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:58,594
TRAINING IN INTERVIEWING 

2414
01:14:58,594 --> 01:14:59,561
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND 

2415
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,161
INVESTIGATING SEXUAL ASSAULT 

2416
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:01,029
LED ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 

2417
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:07,002
ASKING QUESTIONS. 

2418
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,571
THIS WILL BE A STARK CONTRAST 

2419
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:10,873
TO THE GRANDSTANDING AND CHAOS 

2420
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,174
THAT WE SAW FROM THE OTHER SIDE 

2421
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,041
DURING THE PREVIOUS FOUR DAYS 

2422
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,344
IN THIS HEARING PROCESS. 

2423
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,678
I CAN THINK OF NO ONE BETTER 

2424
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:17,612
EQUIPPED TO QUESTION THE 

2425
01:15:17,612 --> 01:15:25,087
WITNESSES THAN RACHEL MITCHELL. 

2426
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:27,556

INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING 

2430
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:33,996
SEX CRIMES. 

2431
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,598
SHE HAS DEDICATED HER CAREER TO 

2432
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,000
SEEKING JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF

2433
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,600
SEX-RELATED FELONIES. 

2434
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,334
MOST RECENTLY, RACHEL WAS THE 

2435
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,602

VICTIMS DIVISION, MARICOPA 

2437
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:48,809
COUNTY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH 

2438
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:49,444
PROSECUTES SEX CRIMES AND 

2439
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:49,844
FAMILY VIOLENCE. 

2440
01:15:49,844 --> 01:15:52,948
THEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, JANET 

2441
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:53,448
NAPOLITANO, PREVIOUSLY 

2442
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:57,452
RECOGNIZED HER AS THE 

2443
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:58,720
OUTSTANDING ARIZONA SEXUAL 

2444
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,353
ASSAULT PROSECUTOR OF THE YEAR. 

2445
01:15:59,353 --> 01:16:06,762
SHE HAS SPENT YEARS INSTRUCTING 

2446
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:07,329
PROSECUTORS, DETECTIVES AND 

2447
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:07,996
CHILD PROTECTION WORKERS ON HOW 

2448
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:13,502
TO PROPERLY INTERVIEW VICTIMS OF

2449
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,470
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE. 

2450
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,340
WITH HER AGE, I LOOK FORWARD TO 

2451
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,008
A FAIR AND PRODUCTIVE HEARING. 

2452
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:20,808
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TWO 

2453
01:16:20,808 --> 01:16:21,609
OTHER PUBLIC ALLEGATIONS. 

2454
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:28,150
TODAY'S HEARING WAS SCHEDULED, 

2455
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,951
IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH DR. 

2456
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:31,653
FORD'S ATTORNEYS, HER TESTIMONY 

2457
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,989
WAY WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF THIS 

2458
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:34,256
HEARING. 

2459
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,258
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO 

2460
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,693
INVESTIGATE OTHER ALLEGATIONS. 

2461
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:40,495
AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE NOT HAD 

2462
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,296
COOPERATION FROM ATTORNEYS 

2463
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:41,896
REPRESENTING OTHER CLIENTS. 

2464
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:42,730
THEY HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO 

2465
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:47,468
SUBSTANTIATE THEIR CLAIMS. 

2466
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:48,670
MY STAFF HAS TRIED TO SECURE 

2467
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,270
TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE FROM 

2468
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:54,242

SWETNICK. 

2476
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:19,768
NEITHER ATTORNEY HAS MADE THEIR 

2477
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:20,602
CLIENTS AVAILABLE FOR 

2478
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:20,902
INTERVIEW. 

2479
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:21,536
THE COMMITTEE CAN'T DO AN 

2480
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:22,304
INVESTIGATION IF ATTORNEYS ARE 

2481
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:22,637
STONEWALLING. 

2482
01:17:22,637 --> 01:17:23,271
I HOPE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THAT 

2483
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:29,778
WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SEEK 

2484
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:30,411
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, AS WE 

2485
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:31,747
DO A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THERE 

2486
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:36,952
ARE HOLES IN WHAT WE CALL THE 

2487
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:37,285
VI REPORTS. 

2488
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:38,286
ADDITIONALLY, ALL THE WITNESSES 

2489
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:43,558
SHOULD KNOW -- WHEN I SAY ALL 

2490
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:44,759
THE WITNESSES, I MEAN DR. FORD 

2491
01:17:44,759 --> 01:17:48,363
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH -- ALL THE 

2492
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:49,698
WITNESSES SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY 

2493
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:58,040
HAVE THE RIGHT UNDER SENATE 

2494
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:58,907
RULE 26.5, TO ASK THAT THE 

2495
01:17:58,907 --> 01:17:59,875
COMMITTEE GO INTO CLOSED 

2496
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:00,442
SESSION IF THE QUESTION 

2497
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,210
REQUIRES AN ANSWER THAT IS A 

2498
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:07,749
CLEAR INVASION OF THEIR RIGHT 

2499
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:08,316
TO PRIVACY. 

2500
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:09,951
IF EITHER DR. FORD OR JUDGE 

2501
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,554
KAVANAUGH FEEL THAT SENATE RULE 

2502
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:13,555
26.5 OUGHT TO BE INVOLVED, THEY 

2503
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:14,655
SHOULD SIMPLY SAY SO. 

2504
01:18:14,655 --> 01:18:17,025
SENATOR FEINSTEIN? 

2505
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:17,959
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 

2506
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:18,226

I WILL MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ON 

2508
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:23,598
YOUR REFERENCES TO ME. 

2509
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:28,202
YES, I DID RECEIVE A LETTER 

2510
01:18:28,202 --> 01:18:28,803
FROM DR. FORD. 

2511
01:18:28,803 --> 01:18:29,871
IT WAS CONVEYED TO ME BY A 

2512
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:36,878
MEMBER OF CONGRESS, CONGRESSMAN 

2513
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:44,485

01:18:44,485 --> 01:18:45,520
SHE REITERATED SHE WANTED THIS 

2515
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,388
CONFIDENTIAL AND I HELD IT 

2516
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,555
CONFIDENTIAL, UP TO A POINT 

2517
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:49,524
WHERE THE WITNESS WAS WILLING 

2518
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:55,831
TO COME FORWARD. 

2519
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:58,299
I THINK AS I MAKE MY REMARKS, 

2520
01:18:58,299 --> 01:19:00,635
YOU WILL PERHAPS SEE WHY. 

2521
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:01,403
BECAUSE HOW WOMEN ARE TREATED 

2522
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,671
IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THIS 

2523
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,941
KIND OF CONCERN, IT'S REALLY

I KNOW THIS WAS NOT EASY FOR 

2532
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:21,223
YOU. 

2533
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,691
BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR 

2534
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:24,893
TESTIMONY AND THE CHAIRMAN CHOSE

2535
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:27,229
NOT TO DO THIS, I THINK IT'S 

2536
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,030
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE 

2537
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,497
PROPERLY INTRODUCED. 

2538
01:19:29,497 --> 01:19:30,598
>> I WAS GOING TO INTRODUCE 

2539
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:30,932
HER. 

2540
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,701
IF YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE HER, I 

2541
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,502
WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU DO 

2542
01:19:34,502 --> 01:19:34,903
THAT. I 

2543
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,671
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I DIDN'T 

2544
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:38,105
FORGET TO DO IT. 

2545
01:19:38,105 --> 01:19:41,009
I WAS ABOUT TO DO IT BEFORE SHE 

2546
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:41,476
SPOKE. 

2547
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,143
>> THANK YOU. 

2548
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:45,614
I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I SAW YOUR 

2549
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,450
CV, I WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSED. 

2550
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,518
YOU HAVE A BACHELORS DEGREE 

2551
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,253

2552
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,689
CAROLINA, CHAPEL HILL, TWO 

2553
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:55,824

PEPPERDINE AND A PhD FROM THE 

2556

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN 

2557
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,129
CALIFORNIA, BETTER KNOWN TO 

2558
01:20:02,129 --> 01:20:08,470
SENATOR HARRIS AND I ASKED USC. 

2559
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,371
YOU ARE A PROFESSOR AFFILIATED 

2560
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:10,005
WITH BOTH STANFORD UNIVERSITY 

2561
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:10,772
AND PALO ALTO UNIVERSITY. 

2562
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:11,573
YOU HAVE PUBLISHED OVER 65 PEER-

2563
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,140
REVIEWED ARTICLES AND HAVE 

2564
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:12,841
RECEIVED NUMEROUS AWARDS FOR 

2565
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:18,146
YOUR WORK AND RESEARCH. 

2566
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:21,883
AS IF THAT WERE NOT ENOUGH, YOU 

2567
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:24,986
ARE A WIFE, A MOTHER OF TWO SONS

2568
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,155
AND A CONSTITUENT FROM 

2569
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:27,789
CALIFORNIA. 

2570
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:30,792
SO, I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU 

2571
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,227
FOR YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR 

2572
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:33,862
BRAVERY IN COMING FORWARD. 

2573
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,630
I KNOW IT'S HARD. 

2574
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,400
BUT, BEFORE I TURN IT OVER, I 

2575
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,567
WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT 

2576
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:40,702
WHAT IS TO BE DISCUSSED TODAY 

2577
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:48,243
AND WHERE WE ARE, AS A COUNTRY. 

2578
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:51,313
SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS A SERIOUS 

2579
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,747
PROBLEM AND ONE THAT LARGELY 

2580
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:53,080
GOES UNSEEN. 

2581
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:53,681
IN THE UNITED STATES, IT'S 

2582
01:20:53,681 --> 01:20:54,816
ESTIMATED BY THE CENTERS FOR 

2583
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:58,920
DISEASE CONTROL THAT ONE IN 

2584
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,522
THREE WOMEN AND ONE IN SIX MEN 

2585
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,523
WILL EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF 

2586
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:02,424
SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THEIR 

2587
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:10,165
LIFETIME. 

2588
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,032
ACCORDING TO THE RAPE, ABUSE 

2589
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:11,666
AND INCEST NATIONAL NETWORK, 

2590
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,935
60% OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS GO 

2591
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,770
UNREPORTED. 

2592
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:16,738
IN ADDITION, WHEN SURVIVORS TO 

2593
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:17,672
REPORT THEIR ASSAULTS, IT'S 

2594
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:18,907
OFTEN YEARS LATER, DUE TO THE 

2595
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:25,780
TRAUMA THEY SUFFERED AND FEARING

2596
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,017
THEIR STORIES WILL NOT BE 

2597
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:29,283
BELIEVED. 

2598
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:30,986
LAST WEEK, I RECEIV A LETTER 

2599
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:31,920
FROM A 60-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIA 

2600
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,754
CONSTITUENT WHO TOLD ME THAT 

2601
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,522
SHE SURVIVED AN ATTEMPTED RAPE 

2602
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:41,396
AT AGE 17 AND DESCRIBED IT AS 

2603
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,164
BEING TERRIFYING AND 

2604
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:43,497
EMBARRASSING. 

2605
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:44,566
SHE NEVER TOLD ANYONE UNTIL 

2606
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,300
MUCH LATER IN LIFE. 

2607
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,768
THE ASSAULT STAYED WITH HER FOR 

2608
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:52,507
43 YEARS. I 

2609
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,242
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

2610
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,110
REMEMBER THESE REALITIES AS WE 

2611
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,111
HEAR FROM DR. FORD ABOUT HER 

2612
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:56,411
EXPERIENCE. 

2613
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,846
THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF 

2614
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:00,048
PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THE 

2615
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:00,682
#METOO MOVEMENT TODAY VERSUS 

2616
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:08,155
THE YEAR OF THE WOMAN ALMOST 27 

2617
01:22:08,155 --> 01:22:10,158
YEARS AGO. 

2618
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:12,327
BUT, WHILE YOUNG WOMEN ARE 

2619
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,963
STANDING UP AND SAYING, NO 

2620
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,597
MORE, OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT 

2621
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:18,633
PROGRESSED AND HOW THEY TREAT 

2622
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:20,534
WOMEN WHO COME FORWARD. 

2623
01:22:20,534 --> 01:22:22,837
TOO OFTEN, WOMEN'S MEMORIES AND 

2624
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:23,671
CREDIBILITY COME UNDER ASSAULT. 

2625
01:22:23,671 --> 01:22:24,505
IN ESSENCE, THEY ARE PUT ON 

2626
01:22:24,505 --> 01:22:33,547
TRIAL AND FORCED TO DEFEND 

2627
01:22:33,547 --> 01:22:33,848
THEMSELVES. 

2628
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:34,582
OFTEN, THEY ARE REVICTIMIZED IN 

2629
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:34,949
THE PROCESS. 

2630
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:36,518
27 YEARS AGO, I WAS WALKING 

2631
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:40,922
THROUGH AN AIRPORT WHEN I SAW A 

2632
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:41,956
LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE GATHERED 

2633
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,024
AROUND A TV TO LISTEN TO ANITA 

2634
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,260
HILL TELL HER STORY. 

2635
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,294
ONE I SAW WAS AN ATTRACTIVE 

2636
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:49,431
WOMAN IN A BLUE SUIT BEFORE AN 

2637
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:50,397
ALL-MALE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

2638
01:22:50,397 --> 01:22:55,303
SPEAKING OF HER EXPERIENCE OF 

2639
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:55,737
SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 

2640
01:22:55,737 --> 01:23:00,742
SHE WAS TREATED BADLY, ACCUSED 

2641
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:02,177
OF LYING, ATTACKED AND HER 

2642
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:10,485
CREDIBILITY PUT TO THE TEST 

2643
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:11,920
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. 

2644
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,654
TODAY, DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 

2645
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:13,621
FORD HAS COME FORWARD TO TELL 

2646
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:14,789
HER STORY OF BEING ASSAULTED 

2647
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:17,759
AND FEARING FOR HER LIFE WHEN 

2648
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:18,793
SHE WAS A TEENAGER. 

2649
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:23,398
INITIALLY, AS I SAID, DR. FORD 

2650
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:24,933
DR. FORD DID NOT WANT TO MAKE 

2651
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:33,040
HER PUBLIC -- STORY PUBLIC. 

2652
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,109
REPUBLICANS SCHEDULED THE 

2653
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,009
HEARING WITHOUT TALKING HER OR 

2654
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:35,876
EVEN INVITING HER TO TESTIFY. 

2655
01:23:35,876 --> 01:23:37,078
SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD TO SHOW UP 

2656
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,012
OR THE COMMITTEE WOULD MOVE 

2657
01:23:38,012 --> 01:23:39,714
FORWARD WITH A VOTE. 

2658
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:47,889
IT TOOK A PUBLIC OUTCRY FROM 

2659
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:48,723
THE MAJORITY -- EXCUSE ME -- 

2660
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:49,858
FOR THE MAJORITY TO BACK DOWN 

2661
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:54,529
AND GIVE HER EVEN A FEW DAYS TO 

2662
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:55,363
COME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 

2663
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,464
REPUBLICANS ALSO SCHEDULED THIS 

2664
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:58,266
HEARING WITH DR. FORD WITHOUT 

2665
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:00,201
HAVING HER ALLEGATIONS 

2666
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:05,673
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI. 

2667
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:06,206
IN 1991, ANITA HILL'S 

2668
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:07,775
ALLEGATIONS WERE REVIEWED BY 

2669
01:24:07,775 --> 01:24:11,145
THE FBI, AS IS THE NORMAL 

2670
01:24:11,145 --> 01:24:18,086
PROCESS AND SQUARELY WITHIN ITS 

2671
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:18,720
JURISDICTION. 

2672
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,123
HOWEVER, DESPITE REPEATED 

2673
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,291
REQUESTS, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

2674
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,058
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE REFUSED TO 

2675
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:25,326
TAKE THIS ROUTINE STEP AND 

2676
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:31,866
DIRECT THE FBI TO CONDUCT AN 

2677
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:32,399
IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION. 

2678
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:33,067
THIS WOULD CLEARLY BE THE BEST 

2679
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:36,070
WAY TO ENSURE A FAIR PROCESS TO 

2680
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:41,943
BOTH JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND TO DR. 

2681
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:42,143
FORD. 

2682
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:44,812
IN 1991, THE SENATE HEARD FROM 

2683
01:24:44,812 --> 01:24:52,520
22 WITNESSES OVER THREE DAYS. 

2684
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,554
TODAY, WHILE REJECTING AN FBI 

2685
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:54,188
INVESTIGATION, REPUBLICANS ARE 

2686
01:24:54,188 --> 01:24:54,855
REFUSING TO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM 

2687
01:24:54,855 --> 01:25:00,962
ANY OTHER WITNESS, INCLUDING 

2688
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:01,729
MARK JUDGE, WHO DR. FORD 

2689
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,431
IDENTIFIED AS BEING IN THE ROOM 

2690
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,533
WHEN THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE. 

2691
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:09,069
WE BELIEVE MARK JUDGE SHOULD BE 

2692
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:14,642
SUBPOENAED SO THE COMMITTEE CAN 

2693
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:15,209
HEAR FROM HIM DIRECTLY. 

2694
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:17,011
REPUBLICANS HAVE ALSO REFUSED 

2695
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:17,912
TO CALL ANYONE WHO COULD SPEAK 

2696
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:19,948
TO THE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD 

2697
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,782
SUPPORT OR REFUTE DR. FORD'S 

2698
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:26,921
CLAIM. NOT ONE WITNESS WHO 

2699
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:31,859
COULD ADDRESS CREDIBILITY AND 

2700
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:32,827
CHARACTER OF EITHER FORD OR 

2701
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:35,797
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN CALLED. 

2702
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:40,034
WHAT I FIND MOST INEXCUSABLE IS 

2703
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,168
THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT AND 

2704
01:25:41,168 --> 01:25:45,540
UNWILLINGNESS TO TAKE THESE 

2705
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,508
KINDS OF ALLEGATIONS AT FACE 

2706
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,209
VALUE AND LOOK AT THEM FOR WHAT 

2707
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,579
THEY ARE, A REAL QUESTION OF 

2708
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:52,547
CHARACTER FOR SOMEONE WHO IS 

2709
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:53,514
ASKING FOR A LIFETIME 

2710
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:55,917
APPOINTMENT ON THE SUPREME 

2711
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:59,454
COURT. 

2712
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:01,789
IN 1991, REPUBLICANS BELITTLED 

2713
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:07,495
PROFESSOR HILLS EXPERIENCE 

2714
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:08,563
SAYING, AND I QUOTE, IT WON'T 

2715
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:10,064
MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE 

2716
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:17,405
OUTCOME. THE BURDEN OF PROOF 

2717
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:17,972
WAS ON PROFESSOR HILL. 

2718
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:18,473
TODAY, OUR REPUBLICAN 

2719
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:23,744
COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING IT'S A 

2720
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,147
HICCUP AND DR. FORD IS MIXED UP 

2721
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,615
AND DECLARING I WILL LISTEN TO 

2722
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:28,716
THE LADY, BUT WE WILL BRING 

2723
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:29,683
THIS TO A CLOSE. 

2724
01:26:29,683 --> 01:26:31,019
WHAT'S WORSE, MANY OF OUR 

2725
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,654
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

2726
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:36,024
THE AISLE HAVE ALSO MADE IT 

2727
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:36,724
CLEAR THAT NO MATTER WHAT 

2728
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:37,759
HAPPENS TODAY, THE SENATE WILL 

2729
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:40,628
PLOW RIGHT THROUGH AND ENSURE 

2730
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:48,402
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD BE 

2731
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:49,303
ELEVATED WITHIN A WEEK. 

2732
01:26:49,303 --> 01:26:50,338
IN FACT, ON TUESDAY, THE 

2733
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,306
MAJORITY WENT AHEAD AND 

2734
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:52,506
SCHEDULED A VOTE ON THE 

2735
01:26:52,506 --> 01:26:53,941
NOMINATION BEFORE WE HEARD ONE 

2736
01:26:53,941 --> 01:26:54,842
WORD OF TESTIMONY REGARDING 

2737
01:26:54,842 --> 01:27:00,748
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

2738
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:01,949
AND MISCONDUCT BY BRETT 

2739
01:27:01,949 --> 01:27:02,249
KAVANAUGH. 

2740
01:27:02,249 --> 01:27:03,084
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP EVEN TOLD 

2741
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:05,253
SENATORS THEY SHOULD PLAN TO BE 

2742
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:09,190
IN OVER THIS WEEKEND SO THE 

2743
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:09,757
NOMINATION CAN BE PUSHED 

2744
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:11,426
THROUGH WITHOUT DELAY. 

2745
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:15,263
THIS IS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT 

2746
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:16,664
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, TWO MORE 

2747
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:19,334
WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD WITH 

2748
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,201
THEIR OWN SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS 

2749
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:27,841
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT INVOLVING 

2750
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:29,677
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

2751
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:32,680
THIS PAST SUNDAY, WE'VE LEARNED 

2752
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,449
ABOUT DEBBIE RAMIREZ, WHO WAS A 

2753
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,517
STUDENT AT YALE WITH BRETT 

2754
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:36,817
KAVANAUGH. 

2755
01:27:36,817 --> 01:27:39,020
SHE, TOO, DID NOT WANT TO COME 

2756
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:39,621
FORWARD BUT AFTER BEING 

2757
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,089
APPROACHED BY REPORTERS, SHE 

2758
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:46,994
TOLD HER STORY. 

2759
01:27:46,994 --> 01:27:48,696
SHE WAS AT A COLLEGE PARTY 

2760
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:49,664
WHERE KAVANAUGH EXPOSED HIMSELF 

2761
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:49,897
TO HER. 

2762
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:50,932
SHE RECALLS PUSHING HIM AWAY 

2763
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:55,103
AND THEN SEEING HIM LAUGHING 

2764
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,770
AND PULLING HIS PANTS UP. 

2765
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:58,473
YESTERDAY, JUDY'S -- JULIE 

2766
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,407
SWETNICK CAME FORWARD TO SAY 

2767
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:00,575
SHE HAD EXPERIENCES OF BEING AT 

2768
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:01,809
HOUSE PARTIES WITH BRETT 

2769
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:07,448
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE. 

2770
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:08,082
SHE RECOUNTED SEEING KAVANAUGH 

2771
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,550
ENGAGE -- AND I QUOTE -- AND 

2772
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,050
ABUSIVE AND PHYSICALLY 

2773
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:11,185
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR TOWARD GIRLS

2774
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:17,158
. IT INCLUDED ATTEMPTS TO, 

2775
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:18,493
QUOTE, REMOVE OR SHIFT GIRL'S 

2776
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:19,026
CLOTHING. 

2777
01:28:19,026 --> 01:28:23,898
NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER, 

2778
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:24,798
GRABBING GIRLS, QUOTE, WITHOUT 

2779
01:28:24,798 --> 01:28:31,539
THERE CONTENT -- CONSENT AND 

2780
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:32,172
TARGETING PARTICULAR GIRLS SO 

2781
01:28:32,172 --> 01:28:33,340
THEY COULD BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 

2782
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,309
OF. 

2783
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,476
EACH OF THESE STORIES ARE 

2784
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:44,619
TROUBLING ON THEIR OWN AND EACH 

2785
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:45,586
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 

2786
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:46,153
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI. 

2787
01:28:46,153 --> 01:28:48,623
ALL THREE WOMEN HAVE SAID THEY 

2788
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:49,656
WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO 

2789
01:28:49,656 --> 01:28:58,933
INVESTIGATE, PLEASE DO SO. 

2790
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:01,402
ALL THREE HAVE SAID THEY HAVE 

2791
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:02,403
OTHER WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE TO 

2792
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:03,103
CORROBORATE THEIR ACCOUNTS. 

2793
01:29:03,103 --> 01:29:04,305
YET, REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO 

2794
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,908
BLINDLY PUSH FORWARD. 

2795
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:07,809
SO, TODAY, WE ARE MOVING 

2796
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:09,010
FORWARD WITH A HEARING AND 

2797
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:13,748
BEING ASKED TO ASSESS THE 

2798
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:14,849
CREDIBILITY OF BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

2799
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:20,087
HE'S MADE SEVERAL STATEMENTS 

2800
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:21,289
ABOUT HOW HIS FOCUS WAS ON 

2801
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:22,222
SCHOOL, BASKETBALL, SERVICE 

2802
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:26,026
PROJECTS AND GOING TO CHURCH. 

2803
01:29:26,026 --> 01:29:27,194
HE DECLARED THAT HE, QUOTE, 

2804
01:29:27,194 --> 01:29:30,164
NEVER DRANK SO MUCH HE COULDN'T 

2805
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:33,301
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AND HE 

2806
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,302
HAS, QUOTE, ALWAYS TREATED 

2807
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:43,511
WOMEN WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. 

2808
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:44,812
WHILE HE HAS MADE THESE 

2809
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:45,580
DECLARATIONS, MORE AND MORE 

2810
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,347
PEOPLE HAVE COME FORWARD TO 

2811
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:46,981
CHALLENGE HIS CHARACTERIZATION 

2812
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,151
OF EVENTS AND BEHAVIORS. 

2813
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:51,218
JAMES ROCHE, HIS FRESHMAN 

2814
01:29:51,218 --> 01:29:52,186
ROOMMATE AT YALE STATED 

2815
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:56,657
KAVANAUGH WAS, AND I QUOTE 

2816
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:57,658
AGAIN, FREQUENTLY INCOHERENTLY 

2817
01:29:57,658 --> 01:29:59,360
DRUNK. 

2818
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:04,732
THAT WAS WHEN, QUOTE, HE BECAME 

2819
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:13,007
AGGRESSIVE AND BELLIGERENT. 

2820
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:15,910
A FRIEND OF HIS FROM YALE SAID, 

2821
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,112
AND I QUOTE, THERE'S NO MEDICAL 

2822
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,914
WAY I CAN SAY THAT HE WAS 

2823
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:20,247
BLACKED OUT. 

2824
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:21,282
IT'S NOT CREDIBLE FOR HIM TO 

2825
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:22,517
SAY THAT HE HAS NO MEMORY 

2826
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:24,252
LAPSES IN THE NIGHTS THAT HE 

2827
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:31,092
DRANK TO EXCESS. LYNN BROOKS, A 

2828
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:31,993
COLLEGE CLASSMATE SAID THE 

2829
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:33,427
PICTURE KAVANAUGH IS TRYING TO 

2830
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:38,166
PAINT DOESN'T MATCH HER MEMORIES

2831
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:39,300
OF HIM. 

2832
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,635
AND I QUOTE, HE IS TRYING TO 

2833
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:41,636
PAINT HIMSELF AS SOME KIND OF 

2834
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:42,503
CHOIR BOY. 

2835
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:48,776
YOU CAN'T LIE YOUR WAY ONTO THE 

2836
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:49,143
SUPREME COURT. 

2837
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:49,810
WITH THAT STATEMENT OUT HE'S 

2838
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:50,344
GONE TOO FAR. 

2839
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:51,678
IT'S ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE 

2840
01:30:51,678 --> 01:30:58,286
INSTITUTION, AND QUOTE. 

2841
01:30:58,286 --> 01:30:58,920
ULTIMATELY, MEMBERS AND LADIES 

2842
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,720
AND GENTLEMEN, I REALLY THINK 

2843
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,420
THAT'S THE POINT. 

2844
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:06,894
WE ARE HERE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO

2845
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:09,162
EVALUATE THIS NOMINEE TO THE 

2846
01:31:09,162 --> 01:31:10,498
MOST PRESTIGIOUS COURT IN OUR 

2847
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:11,265
COUNTRY, AND IT'S ABOUT THE 

2848
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:12,633
INTEGRITY OF THAT INSTITUTION 

2849
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,502
AND THE INTEGRITY OF THIS 

2850
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:14,835
INSTITUTION. 

2851
01:31:14,835 --> 01:31:16,704
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS WATCHING 

2852
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:17,705
HOW WE HANDLE THESE 

2853
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:23,444
ALLEGATIONS. 

2854
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:24,412
I HOPE THE MAJORITY CHANGES 

2855
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:25,346
THEIR TACTICS, OPENS THEIR MIND 

2856
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:29,417
AND SERIOUSLY REFLECTS ON WHY 

2857
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:29,784
WE ARE HERE. 

2858
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:31,052
WE ARE HERE FOR ONE REASON, TO 

2859
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:31,552
DETERMINE WHETHER JUDGE 

2860
01:31:31,552 --> 01:31:35,823
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE ELEVATED TO 

2861
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:36,790
ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL 

2862
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:41,629
POSITIONS IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS 

2863
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:42,697
IS NOT A TRIAL OF DR. FORD, 

2864
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:43,798
IT'S A JOB INTERVIEW FOR JUDGE 

2865
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:44,098
KAVANAUGH. 

2866
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:46,901
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO WE WANT 

2867
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:53,140
ON THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS COURT 

2868
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,141
IN OUR COUNTRY? 

2869
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:57,144
IS SEE THE BEST WE CAN DO? 

2870
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:58,545
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2871
01:31:58,545 --> 01:31:59,714
>> I'M SORRY YOU BROUGHT UP 

2872
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:00,281
ABOUT THE UNSUBSTANTIATED 

2873
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:01,215
ALLEGATIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE 

2874
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:06,020
BECAUSE WE ARE HERE FOR THE 

2875
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:06,988
SOLE PURPOSE OF LISTENING TO 

2876
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:07,688
DR. FORD AND WILL CONSIDER 

2877
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:13,694
OTHER ISSUES AT OTHER TIMES. 

2878
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:14,995
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU RISE 

2879
01:32:14,995 --> 01:32:25,706
ú 

2880
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,675
NOW, DO YOU SWEAR THAT THE 

2881
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:28,843
TESTIMONY YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE 

2882
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,678
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE 

2883
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:32,313
THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND 

2884
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:34,682
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP 

2885
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:34,949

2886
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:35,449
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

2887
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:36,517
PLEASE BE SEATED AND BEFORE YOU 

2888
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:38,052
GIVE YOUR STATEMENT, I WANT TO 

2889
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:39,954

GET A BREAK. 

2893
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:49,463

I'M HERE TODAY NOT BECAUSE I

I'VE DESCRIBED THE EVENTS

I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE 

2951
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:37,438
IMPORTANCE OF YOU HEARING FROM 

2952
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:38,673

01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:43,010
IT HAS HAD ON MY LIFE AND ON MY

FAMILY. 

2956
01:34:46,046 --> 01:34:48,282
I GREW UP IN THE SUBURBS OF 

2957
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:49,350
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND I ATTENDED 

2958

2959
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:51,519
BETHESDA, MARYLAND, FROM 1978 

2960
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:56,724
THROUGH 1984. 

2961
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:59,093
HOLTON ARMS IS AN ALL GIRL 

2962
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:01,996
SCHOOL BUILT IN 1901 AND DURING 

2963
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:04,331
THE TIME AT THE SCHOOL, GIRLS 

2964
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:05,499
AT HOLTON ARMS FREQUENTLY MET 

2965
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:06,634
AND BECAME FRIENDLY WITH BOYS 

2966
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:07,968
FROM ALL BOY SCHOOLS IN THE 

2967
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:09,570

GONZAGA HIGH SCHOOL AS WELL AS 

2969
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:19,847
COUNTRY CLUBS AND OTHER PLACES 

2970
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,582
WHERE KIDS AND FAMILIES 

2971
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:21,882
SOCIALIZED. 

2972
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,017
THIS IS HOW I MET BRETT 

2973
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:24,018
KAVANAUGH, THE BOY WHO SEXUALLY 

2974
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:24,351
ASSAULTED ME. 

2975
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:24,885
DURING MY FRESHMAN AND 

2976
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,888
SOPHOMORE SCHOOL YEARS WHEN I 

2977
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,557
WAS 14 AND 15 YEARS OLD, MY 

2978
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:33,461
GROUP OF FRIENDS INTERSECTED 

2979
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:34,762
WITH BRETT AND HIS FRIENDS FOR 

2980
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:35,663
A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 

2981
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:36,530
I HAD BEEN FRIENDLY WITH A 

2982
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:40,067
CLASSMATE OF BRETT'S FOR A 

2983
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:40,935
SHORT TIME DURING MY FRESHMAN 

2984
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:42,570
AND SOPHOMORE YEAR AND IT WAS 

2985
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:47,007
THROUGH THAT CONNECTION THAT I 

2986
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:48,542
ATTENDED A NUMBER OF PARTIES 

2987
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:50,010
THAT BRETT ALSO ATTENDED. 

2988
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:52,046
WE DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 

2989
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:53,881
BUT I KNEW HIM AND HE KNEW ME. 

2990
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:59,253
IN THE SUMMER OF 1982, MOST 

2991
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:02,656
SUMMERS, I SPENT MOST EVERY DAY 

2992
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:04,758
AT THE COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB IN 

2993
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:06,160
CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND, SWIMMING 

2994
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,427
AND PRACTICING DIVING. 

2995
01:36:07,427 --> 01:36:08,796
ONE EVENING THAT SUMMER, AFTER 

2996
01:36:08,796 --> 01:36:10,731
A DAY OF DIVING AT THE CLUB, I 

2997
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:16,737
ATTENDED A SMALL GATHERING AT A 

2998
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:18,939
HOUSE IN THE BETHESDA AREA. 

2999
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,340
THERE WERE FOUR BOYS I REMEMBER 

3000
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,342
SPECIFICALLY BEING AT THE 

3001
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:22,109
HOUSE. 

3002
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:26,280
BRETT KAVANAUGH, MARK JUDGE, A 

3003
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,415
BOY NAMED PJ AND ONE OTHER BOY 

3004
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:29,149
WHOSE NAME I CANNOT RECALL. 

3005
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:34,488
I ALSO REMEMBER MY FRIEND LELAND

3006
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:34,955
ATTENDING. 

3007
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:36,924
I DO NOT REMEMBER ALL OF THE 

3008
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:38,259
DETAILS OF HOW THAT GATHERING 

3009
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:38,626
CAME TOGETHER. 

3010
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:38,893
TOGETHER. 

3011
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:39,660
LIKE MANY THAT SUMMER, IT WAS 

3012
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,128
ALMOST SURELY A SPUR OF THE 

3013
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,764
MOMENT GATHERING. 

3014
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:45,199
I TRULY WISH I COULD BE MORE 

3015
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:46,033
HELPFUL WITH MORE DETAILED 

3016
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:49,203
ANSWERS TO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS 

3017
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:50,404
THAT HAVE AND WILL BE ASKED 

3018
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:51,739
ABOUT HOW I GOT TO THE PARTY 

3019
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,340
AND WHERE IT TOOK PLACE AND SO 

3020
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,844
FORTH. I 

3021
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:58,946
DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AND 

3022
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,047
I DON'T REMEMBER AS MUCH AS I 

3023
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:00,780
WOULD LIKE TO. 

3024
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,517
BUT, THE DETAILS ABOUT THAT 

3025
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:05,386
NIGHT THAT BRING ME HERE TODAY 

3026
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:06,387
ARE THE ONES I WILL NEVER 

3027
01:37:06,387 --> 01:37:06,620
FORGET. 

3028
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,021
THEY HAVE BEEN SEARED INTO MY 

3029
01:37:08,021 --> 01:37:13,394
MEMORY AND HAVE BEEN HARD TO 

3030
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:14,661
BEAT EPISODICALLY AS AN ADULT. 

3031
01:37:14,661 --> 01:37:17,398
WHEN I GOT TO THE SMALL 

3032
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:18,666
GATHERING, PEOPLE WERE DRINKING 

3033
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,033
BEER AND A SMALL LIVING 

3034
01:37:20,033 --> 01:37:21,368
ROOM/FAMILY ROOM AREA ON THE 

3035
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:21,935
FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. 

3036
01:37:21,935 --> 01:37:29,143
I DRANK ONE BEER. BRETT AND 

3037
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:30,143
MARK WERE VISIBLY DRUNK. 

3038
01:37:30,143 --> 01:37:32,980
EARLY IN THE EVENING, I WENT UP 

3039
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,247
A VERY NARROW SET OF STAIRS 

3040
01:37:34,247 --> 01:37:35,382
LEADING FROM THE LIVING ROOM TO 

3041
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:36,816
A SECOND FLOOR TO USE THE 

3042
01:37:36,816 --> 01:37:43,757
RESTROOM. 

3043
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,059
WHEN I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE 

3044
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:46,026
STAIRS, I WAS PUSHED FROM 

3045
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:47,027
BEHIND INTO A BEDROOM ACROSS 

3046
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:47,560
FROM THE BATHROOM. 

3047
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:51,398
I COULDN'T SEE WHO PUSHED ME. 

3048
01:37:51,398 --> 01:37:53,067
BRETT AND MARK CAME INTO THE 

3049
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:54,335
BEDROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR 

3050
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:54,668
BEHIND THEM. 

3051
01:37:54,668 --> 01:37:55,870
THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING IN THE 

3052
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:59,340
BEDROOM. 

3053
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,908
IT WAS TURNED UP LOUD OR BY 

3054
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:01,875
EITHER BRETT OR MARK ONCE WE 

3055
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:02,543
WERE IN THE ROOM. 

3056
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:08,115
I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED AND 

3057
01:38:08,115 --> 01:38:09,483
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME. 

3058
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:10,217
HE BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER 

3059
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:17,091
MY BODY AND GRINDING INTO ME. I 

3060
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:18,391
YELLED, HOPING THAT SOMEONE 

3061
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:20,995
DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME AND I 

3062
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:22,663
TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM BUT 

3063
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:23,196
HIS WEIGHT WAS HEAVY. 

3064
01:38:23,196 --> 01:38:24,231
BRETT GROPED ME AND TRIED TO 

3065
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:26,467
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. HE HAD A 

3066
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:27,734
HARD TIME BECAUSE HE WAS VERY 

3067
01:38:27,734 --> 01:38:31,839
INEBRIATED AND BECAUSE I WAS 

3068
01:38:31,839 --> 01:38:33,340
WEARING A 1-PIECE BATHING SUIT 

3069
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:37,878
UNDERNEATH MY CLOTHING. 

3070
01:38:37,878 --> 01:38:39,213
I BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO RAPE 

3071
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:39,379
ME. 

3072
01:38:39,379 --> 01:38:43,450
I TRIED TO YELL FOR HELP. 

3073
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,986
WHEN I DID, BRETT PUT HIS HAND 

3074
01:38:45,986 --> 01:38:48,489
OVER MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM 

3075
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:48,922
YELLING. 

3076
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:50,524
THIS IS WHAT TERRIFIED ME THE 

3077
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:52,993
MOST AND HAS HAD THE LASTING 

3078
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:54,027
IMPACT ON MY LIFE. 

3079
01:38:54,027 --> 01:38:55,362
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE 

3080
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:56,530
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 

3081
01:38:56,530 --> 01:39:02,036
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME. 

3082
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:02,936
BOTH BRETT AND MARK WERE 

3083
01:39:02,936 --> 01:39:03,537
DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE 

3084
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:03,770
ATTACK. 

3085
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:05,439
THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING A VERY 

3086
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:10,878
GOOD TIME. 

3087
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:12,679
MARK SEEMED AMBIVALENT AT 

3088
01:39:12,679 --> 01:39:14,481
TIMES, URGING BRETT ON AND AT 

3089
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:16,216
TIMES, TELLING HIM TO STOP. 

3090
01:39:16,216 --> 01:39:18,085
A COUPLE OF TIMES, I MADE EYE 

3091
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:19,085
CONTACT WITH MARK AND THOUGHT 

3092
01:39:19,085 --> 01:39:20,153
HE MIGHT TRY TO HELP ME. 

3093
01:39:20,153 --> 01:39:24,625
BUT, HE DID NOT. 

3094
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:25,659
DURING THIS ASSAULT, MARK CAME 

3095
01:39:25,659 --> 01:39:26,627
OVER AND JUMPED ON THE BED 

3096
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:28,228
TWICE WHILE BRETT WAS ON TOP OF 

3097
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:32,266
ME. 

3098
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:34,935
THE LAST TIME THAT HE DID THIS, 

3099
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:36,136
WE TOPPLED OVER AND BRETT WAS 

3100
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:37,371
NO LONGER ON TOP OF ME. 

3101
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:38,639
I WAS ABLE TO GET UP AND RUN 

3102
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:43,243
OUT OF THE ROOM. 

3103
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:45,813
I WENT DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM THE 

3104
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:47,982
BEDROOM TO THE SMALL BATHROOM 

3105
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,917
AND I RAN INSIDE THE BATHROOM 

3106
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:51,118
AND LOCKED THE DOOR. 

3107
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:52,086
I WAITED UNTIL I HEARD BRETT 

3108
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:53,020
AND MARK LEAVE THE BEDROOM 

3109
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,354
LAUGHING AND LOUDLY WALKED DOWN 

3110
01:39:54,354 --> 01:39:56,890
THE NARROW STAIRWAY, PIN 

3111
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:58,359
BOWLING OFF THE WALLS ON THE 

3112
01:39:58,359 --> 01:39:58,625
WAY DOWN. 

3113
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:05,332
I WAITED AND WHEN I DID NOT 

3114
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:07,701
HEAR THEM COME BACK UP THE 

3115
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:10,170
STAIRS, I LEFT THE BATHROOM, 

3116
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,004
WENT DOWN THE SAME STAIRWELL 

3117
01:40:11,004 --> 01:40:11,672
THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM AND 

3118
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:12,472
LEFT THE HOUSE. 

3119
01:40:12,472 --> 01:40:17,144
I REMEMBERED BEING ON THE STREET

3120
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:18,879
AND FEELING AN ENORMOUS SENSE 

3121
01:40:18,879 --> 01:40:19,947
OF RELIEF THAT I ESCAPED THAT 

3122
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:21,148
HOUSE AND THAT BRETT AND MARK 

3123
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:22,916
WERE NOT COMING OUTSIDE AFTER 

3124
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:23,717
ME. 

3125
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:24,418
BRETT'S ASSAULT ON ME 

3126
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:27,954
DRASTICALLY ALTERED MY LIFE FOR 

3127
01:40:27,954 --> 01:40:28,655
A VERY LONG TIME. 

3128
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:33,994
I WAS TOO AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO 

3129
01:40:33,994 --> 01:40:34,928
TELL ANYONE THESE DETAILS. 

3130
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:37,931
I DID NOT WANT TO TELL MY 

3131
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:41,802
PARENTS THAN I, AT AGE 15, WAS 

3132
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:42,703
IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY 

3133
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:43,937
PARENTS PRESENT DRINKING BEER 

3134
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:46,607
WITH BOYS. 

3135
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,008
I CONVINCED MYSELF THAT BECAUSE 

3136
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:49,542
BRETT DID NOT RATE ME, I SHOULD 

3137
01:40:49,542 --> 01:40:51,078
JUST MOVE ON AND PRETEND IT 

3138
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:56,817
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

3139
01:40:56,817 --> 01:40:59,887
OVER THE YEARS, I TOLD VERY, 

3140
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:02,856
VERY FEW FRIENDS THAT I HAD HAD 

3141
01:41:02,856 --> 01:41:04,525
THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. I 

3142
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:06,360
TOLD MY HUSBAND BEFORE WE WERE 

3143
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,227
MARRIED THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED 

3144
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:08,161
A SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

3145
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:09,762
I HAD NEVER TOLD THE DETAILS TO 

3146
01:41:09,762 --> 01:41:15,169
ANYONE, THE SPECIFIC DETAILS, 

3147
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:16,637
UNTIL MAY 2012 DURING A COUPLES 

3148
01:41:16,637 --> 01:41:17,070
COUNSELING SESSION. 

3149
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:18,137
THE REASON THIS CAME UP IN 

3150
01:41:18,137 --> 01:41:20,607
COUNSELING WAS THAT MY HUSBAND 

3151
01:41:20,607 --> 01:41:23,010
AND I HAD COMPLETED A VERY 

3152
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:27,281
EXTENSIVE, VERY LONG REMODEL OF 

3153
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:28,348
OUR HOME AND I INSISTED ON A 

3154
01:41:28,348 --> 01:41:32,019
SECOND FRONT DOOR, AN IDEA THAT 

3155
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:32,786
HE AND OTHERS DISAGREED WITH 

3156
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:38,992
AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. IN 

3157
01:41:38,992 --> 01:41:42,129
EXPLAINING WHY, WHY I WANTED A 

3158
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:44,498
SECOND FRONT DOOR, I BEGAN TO 

3159
01:41:44,498 --> 01:41:46,900
DESCRIBE THE ASSAULT IN DETAIL. 

3160
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,936
I RECALLED SAYING THAT THE BOY 

3161
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,904
WHO ASSAULTED ME COULD SOMEDAY 

3162
01:41:50,904 --> 01:41:53,273
BE ON THE U.S. SUPREME COURT 

3163
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:54,675
AND SPOKE ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND 

3164
01:41:54,675 --> 01:41:57,344
AT AN ELITIST ALL BOYS SCHOOL IN

3165
01:41:57,344 --> 01:41:57,777
BETHESDA, MARYLAND. 

3166
01:41:57,777 --> 01:41:58,679
MY HUSBAND RECALLS THAT I NAMED 

3167
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:05,085
MY ATTACKER AS BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

3168
01:42:05,085 --> 01:42:07,888
AFTER THAT MAY 2012 THERAPY 

3169
01:42:07,888 --> 01:42:10,657
SESSION, I DID MY BEST TO 

3170
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:12,226
IGNORE THE MEMORIES OF THE 

3171
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:13,060
ASSAULT BECAUSE RECOUNTING THEM 

3172
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:13,927
CAUSED ME TO RELIVE THE 

3173
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:15,161
EXPERIENCE AND CAUSED PANIC AND 

3174
01:42:15,161 --> 01:42:19,099
ANXIETY. 

3175
01:42:19,099 --> 01:42:20,167
OCCASIONALLY, I WOULD DISCUSS 

3176
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:21,034
THE ASSAULT IN INDIVIDUAL 

3177
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:25,672
THERAPY SESSIONS. 

3178
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:26,840
TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE 

3179
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,242
RELIVING OF THE TRAUMA SO I 

3180
01:42:28,242 --> 01:42:29,843
TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT OR 

3181
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:30,143
DISCUSS IT. 

3182
01:42:30,143 --> 01:42:31,011
OVER THE YEARS, I WENT THROUGH 

3183
01:42:31,011 --> 01:42:32,312
PERIODS WHERE I THOUGHT ABOUT 

3184
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:38,452
THE ATTACK. I HAD CONFIDED IN 

3185
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:39,419
SOME CLOSE FRIENDS THAT I HAD 

3186
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:40,487
AN EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL 

3187
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:43,590
ASSAULT. 

3188
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:44,424
OCCASIONALLY, I STATED THAT MY 

3189
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:45,225
ASSAILANT WAS A PROMINENT 

3190
01:42:45,225 --> 01:42:47,027
LAWYER OR JUDGE BUT I DID NOT 

3191
01:42:47,027 --> 01:42:48,829
USE HIS NAME. 

3192
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,163
I DO NOT RECALL EACH PERSON I 

3193
01:42:50,163 --> 01:42:56,103
SPOKE TO ABOUT BRETT'S ASSAULT. 

3194
01:42:56,103 --> 01:42:58,038
SOME FRIENDS HAVE REMINDED ME 

3195
01:42:58,038 --> 01:42:58,939
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS SINCE 

3196
01:42:58,939 --> 01:42:59,472
THE PUBLICATION OF THE 

3197
01:42:59,472 --> 01:43:00,574
WASHINGTON POST STORY ON 

3198
01:43:00,574 --> 01:43:06,079
SEPTEMBER 16, 2018. 

3199
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:06,947
UNTIL JULY 2018, I HAD NEVER 

3200
01:43:06,947 --> 01:43:07,814
NAMED MR. KAVANAUGH AS THE 

3201
01:43:07,814 --> 01:43:09,015
ATTACKER OUTSIDE OF THERAPY. 

3202
01:43:09,015 --> 01:43:17,824
THIS CHANGED IN EARLY JULY 

3203
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:19,259
2018. I 

3204
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:20,927
SAW PRESS REPORTS STATING THAT 

3205
01:43:20,927 --> 01:43:21,862
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS ON THE 

3206
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,196
SHORT LIST OF A LIST OF VERY 

3207
01:43:23,196 --> 01:43:24,064
WELL-QUALIFIED SUPREME COURT 

3208
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:26,867
NOMINEES. 

3209
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,269
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY CIVIC DUTY 

3210
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:31,037
TO RELAY THE INFORMATION I HAD 

3211
01:43:31,037 --> 01:43:31,738
ABOUT MR. KAVANAUGH'S CONDUCT 

3212
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:32,739
SO THAT THOSE CONSIDERING HIS 

3213
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:33,440
NOMINATION WOULD KNOW ABOUT 

3214
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,207
THIS ASSAULT. 

3215
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:42,683
ON JULY 6, I HAD A SENSE OF 

3216
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:43,283
URGENCY TO RELAY THE 

3217
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:45,118
INFORMATION TO THE SENATE AND 

3218
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:46,587
THE PRESIDENT AS SOON AS 

3219
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:48,388
POSSIBLE BEFORE A NOMINEE WAS 

3220
01:43:48,388 --> 01:43:49,456
SELECTED. 

3221
01:43:49,456 --> 01:43:52,693
I DID NOT KNOW HOW, 

3222
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:54,861
SPECIFICALLY, TO DO THIS. I 

3223
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:56,396
CALLED MY CONGRESSIONAL 

3224
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:57,598
REPRESENTATIVE AND LET HER 

3225
01:43:57,598 --> 01:43:59,299
RECEPTIONIST KNOW THAT SOMEONE 

3226
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:02,035
ON THE PRESIDENT'S SHORTLIST 

3227
01:44:02,035 --> 01:44:03,704
HAD ATTACKED ME. I 

3228
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:04,771
ALSO SENT A MESSAGE TO THE 

3229
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:05,605
ENCRYPTED WASHINGTON POST 

3230
01:44:05,605 --> 01:44:07,274
CONFIDENTIAL TIP LINE. I 

3231
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:10,344
DID NOT USE MY NAME, BUT I 

3232
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:11,478
PROVIDED THE NAMES OF BRETT 

3233
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:13,813
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE. 

3234
01:44:13,813 --> 01:44:14,715
I STATED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD 

3235
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:16,048
ASSAULTED ME IN THE 1980s IN 

3236
01:44:16,048 --> 01:44:17,017
MARYLAND. 

3237
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:17,951
THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY HARD 

3238
01:44:17,951 --> 01:44:21,088
THING FOR ME TO DO. 

3239
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,056
BUT, I FELT THAT I COULDN'T NOT 

3240
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:28,061
DO IT. 

3241
01:44:28,061 --> 01:44:31,732
OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS, A TOLD 

3242
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:33,500
A COUPLE OF CLOSE FRIENDS ON 

3243
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,801
THE BEACH IN CALIFORNIA THAT 

3244
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:35,702
MR. KAVANAUGH HAD SEXUALLY 

3245
01:44:35,702 --> 01:44:36,035
ASSAULTED ME. 

3246
01:44:36,035 --> 01:44:36,803
I WAS VERY CONFLICTED AS TO 

3247
01:44:36,803 --> 01:44:41,575
WHETHER TO SPEAK OUT. 

3248
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:42,843
ON JULY 9, I RECEIVED A RETURN 

3249
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:44,277
PHONE CALL FROM THE OFFICE OF 

3250
01:44:44,277 --> 01:44:50,917
CONGRESSWOMAN ANNA ESHOO AFTER 

3251
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:53,520
MR. KAVANAUGH HAD BECOME THE 

3252
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:53,854
NOMINEE. 

3253
01:44:53,854 --> 01:44:56,990
I MET WITH HER STAFF ON JULY 18 

3254
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:57,991
AND WITH HER ON JULY 20, 

3255
01:44:57,991 --> 01:44:58,558
DESCRIBING THE ASSAULT AND 

3256
01:44:58,558 --> 01:44:59,626
DISCUSSING FEARS OF COMING 

3257
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:05,665
FORWARD. 

3258
01:45:05,665 --> 01:45:06,900
LATER WE DISCUSSED THE 

3259
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:07,934
POSSIBILITY OF SENDING A LETTER 

3260
01:45:07,934 --> 01:45:08,534
TO RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN, 

3261
01:45:08,534 --> 01:45:09,335
ONE OF MY STATE SENATORS, 

3262
01:45:09,335 --> 01:45:11,638
DESCRIBING WHAT OCCURRED. 

3263
01:45:11,638 --> 01:45:12,506
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT 

3264
01:45:12,506 --> 01:45:20,680
REPRESENTATIVE ANNA ESHOO'S 

3265
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,649
OFFICE TO THE ZOO -- DELIVERED 

3266
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:23,683
A LETTER TO MS. FEINSTEIN'S 

3267
01:45:23,683 --> 01:45:23,916
OFFICE. 

3268
01:45:23,916 --> 01:45:25,018
THE LETTER INCLUDED MY NAME AND 

3269
01:45:25,018 --> 01:45:26,286
A REQUEST THAT IT BE KEPT 

3270
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:28,955
CONFIDENTIAL. 

3271
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:30,090
MY HOPE WAS THAT PROVIDING THE 

3272
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:30,957
INFORMATION CONFIDENTIALLY 

3273
01:45:30,957 --> 01:45:37,097
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW 

3274
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:39,900
THE SENATE TO CONSIDER MR. 

3275
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,468
KAVANAUGH'S SERIOUS MISCONDUCT 

3276
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:44,004
WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE MYSELF, 

3277
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:45,705
MY FAMILY OR ANYONE'S FAMILY 

3278
01:45:45,705 --> 01:45:46,473
VULNERABLE TO THE PERSONAL 

3279
01:45:46,473 --> 01:45:47,040
ATTACKS AND INVASIONS OF 

3280
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:47,974
PRIVACY THAT WE HAVE FACED 

3281
01:45:47,974 --> 01:45:52,145
SINCE MY NAME BECAME PUBLIC. 

3282
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:53,980
IN A LETTER DATED AUGUST 31, 

3283
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:54,748
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WROTE THAT 

3284
01:45:54,748 --> 01:45:55,816
SHE WOULD NOT SHARE THE LETTER 

3285
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:56,983
WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT CONSENT AND 

3286
01:45:56,983 --> 01:46:03,990
I APPRECIATED THIS COMMITMENT. 

3287
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:04,657
SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS SHOULD 

3288
01:46:04,657 --> 01:46:05,826
BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR 

3289
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:06,393
THEMSELVES WHEN AND WHETHER 

3290
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:11,231
THEIR PRIVATE EXPERIENCE IS 

3291
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:11,564
MADE PUBLIC. 

3292
01:46:11,564 --> 01:46:12,699
AS THE HEARING DATE GOT CLOSER, 

3293
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,833
I STRUGGLED WITH A TERRIBLE 

3294
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:18,271
CHOICE. DO I SHARE THE FACTS 

3295
01:46:18,271 --> 01:46:19,439
WITH THE SENATE AND PUT MYSELF 

3296
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:20,907
AND MY FAMILY AND THE PUBLIC 

3297
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:23,710
SPOTLIGHT? 

3298
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:24,945
OR, DO I PRESERVE MY PRIVACY 

3299
01:46:24,945 --> 01:46:25,879
AND ALLOW THE SENATE TO MAKE 

3300
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:26,979
ITS DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING 

3301
01:46:26,979 --> 01:46:28,415
THE FULL TRUTH OF HIS PAST 

3302
01:46:28,415 --> 01:46:33,620
BEHAVIORS. 

3303
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,554
I AGONIZED DAILY WITH THIS 

3304
01:46:34,554 --> 01:46:35,455
DECISION THROUGHOUT AUGUST AND 

3305
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:43,930
SEPTEMBER 2018. 

3306
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,532
THE SENSE OF DUTY THAT 

3307
01:46:45,532 --> 01:46:46,500
ORIGINALLY MOTIVATED ME TO 

3308
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,968
REACH OUT CONFIDENTIALLY TO THE 

3309
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:48,935
WASHINGTON POST AND TO THE 

3310
01:46:48,935 --> 01:46:50,036
OFFICE OF ANNA ESHOO WHEN THERE 

3311
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:50,803
WAS STILL A LIST OF EXTREMELY 

3312
01:46:50,803 --> 01:46:51,972
QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AND TO 

3313
01:46:51,972 --> 01:47:00,046
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, WAS ALWAYS 

3314
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:01,214
THERE. 

3315
01:47:01,214 --> 01:47:03,683
BUT, MY FEARS OF THE 

3316
01:47:03,683 --> 01:47:06,086
CONSEQUENCES OF SPEAKING OUT 

3317
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,053
STARTED TO EXPONENTIALLY 

3318
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:07,320
INCREASE. 

3319
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,021
DURING AUGUST 2018, THE PRESS 

3320
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:09,089
REPORTED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH 

3321
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:09,656
CONFIRMATION WAS VIRTUALLY 

3322
01:47:09,656 --> 01:47:12,659
CERTAIN. 

3323
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:13,693
PERSONS PAINTED HIM OF A 

3324
01:47:13,693 --> 01:47:20,901
CHAMPIONS RIGHTS AND 

3325
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:23,436
EMPOWERMENT AND I BELIEVED IF I 

3326
01:47:23,436 --> 01:47:24,971
GAME FORWARD, MY SINGLE VOICE 

3327
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:27,207
WOULD BE DROWNED OUT BY A CHORUS

3328
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:28,108
OF POWERFUL SUPPORTERS. 

3329
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,276
BY THE TIME OF THE CONFIRMATION 

3330
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:29,976
HEARINGS I HAD RESIGNED MYSELF 

3331
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:32,212
TO REMAIN QUIET AND LETTING THE 

3332
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:33,380
COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE MAKE 

3333
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:35,114
THEIR DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING 

3334
01:47:35,114 --> 01:47:36,583
WHAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD DONE TO 

3335
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:41,754
ME. 

3336
01:47:41,754 --> 01:47:43,290
ONCE THE PRESS STARTED 

3337
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:45,992
REPORTING ON THE EXISTENCE OF 

3338
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:47,994
THE LETTER, THAT I HAD SENT TO 

3339
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:48,695
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, I FACED 

3340
01:47:48,695 --> 01:47:49,128
MOUNTING PRESSURE. 

3341
01:47:49,128 --> 01:47:49,762
REPORTERS APPEARED AT MY HOME 

3342
01:47:49,762 --> 01:47:51,397
AND AT MY WORKPLACE DEMANDING 

3343
01:47:51,397 --> 01:48:00,040
INFORMATION ABOUT THE LETTER 

3344
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,442
AND IN THE PRESENTS OF MY 

3345
01:48:02,442 --> 01:48:03,009
GRADUATE STUDENTS. 

3346
01:48:03,009 --> 01:48:05,045
THEY CALLED MY BOSSES AND 

3347
01:48:05,045 --> 01:48:07,447
COWORKERS AND LEFT ME MANY 

3348
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:09,249
MESSAGES MAKING IT CLEAR THAT 

3349
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:11,051
MY NAME WOULD INEVITABLY BE 

3350
01:48:11,051 --> 01:48:13,053
RELEASED TO THE MEDIA. I 

3351
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:13,986
DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY 

3352
01:48:13,986 --> 01:48:15,255
TO A JOURNALIST WHO ORIGINALLY 

3353
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:16,523
RESPONDED TO THE TIP I HAD SENT 

3354
01:48:16,523 --> 01:48:17,290
TO THE WASHINGTON POST AND WHO 

3355
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:20,927
HAD GAINED MY TRUST. 

3356
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:22,028
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO 

3357
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:23,330
DESCRIBE THE DETAILS OF THE 

3358
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:26,833
ASSAULT IN MY OWN WORDS. 

3359
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:29,035
SINCE SEPTEMBER 16, THE DATE OF 

3360
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:33,239
THE WASHINGTON POST STORY, I 

3361
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:37,009
HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OUTPOURING 

3362
01:48:37,009 --> 01:48:37,811
 

3363
01:48:37,811 --> 01:48:39,612
STATE OF THIS COUNTRY. 

3364
01:48:39,612 --> 01:48:41,080
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 

3365
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,116
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES 

3366
01:48:43,116 --> 01:48:43,984
DRAMATICALLY ALTERED BY SEXUAL 

3367
01:48:43,984 --> 01:48:44,951
VIOLENCE HAVE REACHED OUT TO 

3368
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:45,719
SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND HAVE 

3369
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:51,057
THANKED ME FOR COMING FORWARD. 

3370
01:48:51,057 --> 01:48:52,892
WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS 

3371
01:48:52,892 --> 01:48:55,495
SUPPORT FROM OUR FRIENDS IN OUR 

3372
01:48:55,495 --> 01:48:55,795
COMMUNITY. 

3373
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:58,097
AT THE SAME TIME, MY GREATEST 

3374
01:48:58,097 --> 01:48:59,899
FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND 

3375
01:48:59,899 --> 01:49:01,768
THE REALITY HAS BEEN FAR WORSE. 

3376
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:03,670
MY REALITY IS FAR WORSE THAN 

3377
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:03,937
EXPECTED. 

3378
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:05,105
MY FAMILY AND I ARE THE TARGET 

3379
01:49:05,105 --> 01:49:06,006
OF CONSTANT HARASSMENT AND 

3380
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:10,544
DEATH STRENGTHS -- DEATH 

3381
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:11,578
THREATS AND I'VE BEEN CALLED 

3382
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:12,846
THE MOST VILE AND HATEFUL NAMES 

3383
01:49:12,846 --> 01:49:13,980
IMAGINABLE. 

3384
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:18,852
THESE EXPRESSIONS HAVE BEEN 

3385
01:49:18,852 --> 01:49:19,652
TERRIFYING AND HAVE ROCKED ME 

3386
01:49:19,652 --> 01:49:20,320
TO MY CORE. 

3387
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,153
PEOPLE HAVE POSTED MY PERSONAL 

3388
01:49:21,153 --> 01:49:22,923
INFORMATION AND THAT OF MY 

3389
01:49:22,923 --> 01:49:29,829
PARENTS ONLINE ON THE INTERNET. 

3390
01:49:29,829 --> 01:49:31,297
THIS HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL 

3391
01:49:31,297 --> 01:49:33,233
EMAILS, CALLS AND THREATS. 

3392
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:35,502
MY FAMILY AND I WERE FORCED TO 

3393
01:49:35,502 --> 01:49:36,202
MOVE OUT OF OUR HOME. 

3394
01:49:36,202 --> 01:49:36,970
SINCE SEPTEMBER 16, MY FAMILY 

3395
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:42,041
AND I HAVE BEEN VISITING IN 

3396
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:44,844
VARIOUS LOCALES, AND TIME 

3397
01:49:44,844 --> 01:49:46,145
SEPARATED AND AT TIMES TOGETHER 

3398
01:49:46,145 --> 01:49:47,480
WITH THE HELP OF SECURITY 

3399
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:47,713
GUARDS. 

3400
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:48,448
THIS PAST TUESDAY EVENING, MY 

3401
01:49:48,448 --> 01:49:49,416
WORK EMAIL WAS HACKED AND 

3402
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,583
MESSAGES WERE SENT OUT TRYING 

3403
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:53,319
TO RECANT MY DESCRIPTION OF THE 

3404
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:58,925
SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

3405
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,227
APART FROM THE ASSAULT, ITSELF, 

3406
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:03,029
THESE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE 

3407
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:04,130
BEEN THE HARDEST OF MY LIFE. 

3408
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:05,164
I'VE HAD TO RELIVE THIS TRAUMA 

3409
01:50:05,164 --> 01:50:11,371
IN FRONT OF THE WORLD AND I'VE 

3410
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:12,505
SEEN MY LIFE PICKED APART BY 

3411
01:50:12,505 --> 01:50:13,072
PEOPLE IN TELEVISION, ON 

3412
01:50:13,072 --> 01:50:14,908
TWITTER AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA 

3413
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:20,880
AND IN THIS BODY, WHO HAVE 

3414
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,981
NEVER MET ME OR SPOKEN WITH ME. 

3415
01:50:21,981 --> 01:50:23,048
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ACTING 

3416
01:50:23,048 --> 01:50:24,216
OUT OF PARTISAN POLITICAL 

3417
01:50:24,216 --> 01:50:30,056
MOTIVES AND THOSE WHO SAY THAT 

3418
01:50:30,056 --> 01:50:32,091
DO NOT KNOW ME. 

3419
01:50:32,091 --> 01:50:33,126
I'M AN INDEPENDENT PERSON AND 

3420
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:33,860
I'M NO ONE'S PAWN. 

3421
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:34,728
MY MOTIVATION IN COMING FORWARD 

3422
01:50:34,728 --> 01:50:38,465
WAS TO BE HELPFUL AND TO 

3423
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:39,065
PROVIDE FACTS ABOUT HOW MR. 

3424
01:50:39,065 --> 01:50:40,200
KAVANAUGH'S ACTIONS HAVE 

3425
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:45,038
DAMAGED MY LIFE SO THAT YOU 

3426
01:50:45,038 --> 01:50:47,640
COULD TAKE INTO A SERIOUS 

3427
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:49,242
CONSIDERATION, AS YOU MAKE YOUR 

3428
01:50:49,242 --> 01:50:51,010
DECISION ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED, 

3429
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:52,245
AND IT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY 

3430
01:50:52,245 --> 01:50:52,779
TO DETERMINE WHETHER MR. 

3431
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:54,214
KAVANAUGH DESERVES TO SIT ON 

3432
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:55,315
THE SUPREME COURT. MY 

3433
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:56,583
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TELL YOU 

3434
01:50:56,583 --> 01:51:03,857
THE TRUTH. 

3435
01:51:03,857 --> 01:51:05,291
I UNDERSTAND THAT A 

3436
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:06,092
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR HAS 

3437
01:51:06,092 --> 01:51:08,061
BEEN HIRED TO ASK ME QUESTIONS 

3438
01:51:08,061 --> 01:51:09,429
AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING MY 

3439
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:10,830
VERY BEST TO ANSWER THEM. 

3440
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:11,798
I'VE NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY A 

3441
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:13,165
PROSECUTOR AND I WILL DO MY 

3442
01:51:13,165 --> 01:51:16,035
BEST. 

3443
01:51:16,035 --> 01:51:17,437
AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE THE 

3444
01:51:17,437 --> 01:51:18,304
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL BE 

3445
01:51:18,304 --> 01:51:19,038
JUDGING MY CREDIBILITY, I DO 

3446
01:51:19,038 --> 01:51:20,373
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE 

3447
01:51:20,373 --> 01:51:22,709
DIRECTLY WITH EACH OF YOU. AT 

3448
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:23,910
THIS POINT, I WILL DO MY BEST 

3449
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:30,717
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. 

3450
01:51:30,717 --> 01:51:31,851
AND, THE REQUESTS FOR CAFFEINE. 

3451
01:51:31,851 --> 01:51:34,420
>> A COKE OR SOMETHING? 

3452
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:36,856
>> THAT SOUNDS GOOD. 

3453
01:51:36,856 --> 01:51:38,925
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. 

3454
01:51:38,925 --> 01:51:39,626
>> THANK YOU. 

3455
01:51:39,626 --> 01:51:40,693
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

3456
01:51:40,693 --> 01:51:41,494
BEFORE I USE MY FIVE MINUTES OF 

3457
01:51:41,494 --> 01:51:43,029
QUESTIONING, I THOUGHT THAT I'D 

3458
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:47,834
TRY TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES -- 

3459
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:49,235
AND IN THIS CASE, MS. MITCHELL, 

3460
01:51:49,235 --> 01:51:57,076
AS WELL, THAT THE 5 MINUTES -- 

3461
01:51:57,076 --> 01:51:58,378
THE WAY I TRADITIONALLY HAVE 

3462
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:58,678
DONE THIS. 

3463
01:51:58,678 --> 01:52:03,115
IF YOU ASK A QUESTION BEFORE 

3464
01:52:03,115 --> 01:52:04,751
YOUR TIME RUNS OUT AND EVEN 

3465
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:05,785
THOUGH YOU GO OVER YOUR TIME, 

3466
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:07,019
AS LONG AS YOU AREN'T 

3467
01:52:07,019 --> 01:52:11,290
FILIBUSTERING, I WILL LET YOU 

3468
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:11,991
ASK YOUR QUESTION. 

3469
01:52:11,991 --> 01:52:12,758
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT 

3470
01:52:12,758 --> 01:52:16,830
BOTH DR. FORD AND DR. FORD AND 

3471
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:22,535
JUDGE KAVANAUGH -- AS CHAIRMAN 

3472
01:52:22,535 --> 01:52:23,770
OF THE COMMITTEE -- I KNOW THEY 

3473
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:25,905
WILL GET A CHANCE TO ANSWER THE 

3474
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:26,305
QUESTIONS FULLY. 

3475
01:52:26,305 --> 01:52:27,173
BEYOND THE 5 MINUTES. 

3476
01:52:27,173 --> 01:52:31,043
BUT, WHEN EITHER DR. FORD OR 

3477
01:52:31,043 --> 01:52:36,449
JUDGE KAVANAUGH GETS DONE, WE 

3478
01:52:36,449 --> 01:52:37,283
IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE NEXT 

3479
01:52:37,283 --> 01:52:37,516
PERSON. 

3480
01:52:37,516 --> 01:52:45,258
SO, I HOPE THAT WILL BE DONE. 

3481
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:47,627
DR. FORD, I'M TOLD THAT YOU 

3482
01:52:47,627 --> 01:52:49,162
WANT A BREAK RIGHT NOW. 

3483
01:52:49,162 --> 01:52:50,830
IF YOU DO, THAT'S FINE. 

3484
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,865
>> I'M OKAY. 

3485
01:52:51,865 --> 01:52:54,200
I GOT THE COFFEE. 

3486
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,001
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

3487
01:52:55,001 --> 01:52:57,570
I THINK I CAN PROCEED WITH THE 

3488
01:52:57,570 --> 01:52:57,803
COFFEE. 

3489
01:52:57,803 --> 01:52:59,005
>> NOBODY CAN MIX UP MY COFFEE 

3490
01:52:59,005 --> 01:52:59,872
RIGHT, SO YOU ARE PRETTY 

3491
01:52:59,872 --> 01:53:00,506
FORTUNATE. 

3492
01:53:00,506 --> 01:53:06,779
NOW, WITH THAT, YOU HAVE MY 

3493
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:08,047
FIVE MINUTES TO ASK QUESTIONS, 

3494
01:53:08,047 --> 01:53:11,417
MS. MITCHELL. 

3495
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:16,289
>> GOOD MORNING, DR. FORD. 

3496
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:17,023
WE HAVEN'T MET. 

3497
01:53:17,023 --> 01:53:18,257
MY NAME IS RACHEL MITCHELL. 

3498
01:53:18,257 --> 01:53:19,392
>> NICE TO MEET YOU. 

3499
01:53:19,392 --> 01:53:22,395
>> I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THE 

3500
01:53:22,395 --> 01:53:23,730
FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME FROM 

3501
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:26,232
YOUR STATEMENT THIS MORNING WAS 

3502
01:53:26,232 --> 01:53:27,367
THAT YOU ARE TERRIFIED AND JUST 

3503
01:53:27,367 --> 01:53:28,668
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I'M VERY 

3504
01:53:28,668 --> 01:53:29,335
SORRY. 

3505
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:34,307
THAT'S NOT RIGHT. I 

3506
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:36,442
KNOW THIS IS STRESSFUL AND I 

3507
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:38,444
WOULD LIKE TO SET FORTH SOME 

3508
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:40,680
GUIDELINES THAT MAY ALLEVIATE 

3509
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,547
THAT A LITTLE BIT. 

3510
01:53:41,547 --> 01:53:42,782
IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT 

3511
01:53:42,782 --> 01:53:43,750
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, PLEASE 

3512
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:48,888
ASK ME TO CLARIFY IT. 

3513
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:51,724
OR, ASK IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. 

3514
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:53,660
WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS, I MAY 

3515
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:54,761
REFER TO OTHER INFORMATION YOU 

3516
01:53:54,761 --> 01:53:55,128
HAVE PROVIDED. 

3517
01:53:55,128 --> 01:53:56,396
IF I DO THAT AND I GET IT 

3518
01:53:56,396 --> 01:54:00,233
WRONG, PLEASE CORRECT ME. 

3519
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:03,136
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO 

3520
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:03,937
GUESS. I 

3521
01:54:03,937 --> 01:54:05,905
KNOW IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. 

3522
01:54:05,905 --> 01:54:06,940
IF YOU DO ESTIMATE, PLEASE LET 

3523
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,308
ME KNOW THAT YOU ARE 

3524
01:54:08,308 --> 01:54:13,246
ESTIMATING, OKAY? 

3525
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:16,182
WE'VE PUT BEFORE YOU, AND I'M 

3526
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:18,051
SURE YOU HAVE COPIES OF IT 

3527
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:19,852
ANYWAY, FIVE PIECES OF 

3528
01:54:19,852 --> 01:54:20,820
INFORMATION AND THEY WANT TO GO 

3529
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:21,120
OVER THEM. 

3530
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:22,621
THE FIRST IS A SCREENSHOT OF A 

3531
01:54:22,621 --> 01:54:26,559
WHATSAPP TEXTING BETWEEN YOU 

3532
01:54:26,559 --> 01:54:27,727
AND SOMEBODY AT THE WASHINGTON 

3533
01:54:27,727 --> 01:54:27,927
POST. 

3534
01:54:27,927 --> 01:54:29,262
DO YOU HAVE THAN IN FRONT OF 

3535
01:54:29,262 --> 01:54:31,030
YOU? 

3536
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:33,166
>> YES. 

3537
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:34,767
>> THE FIRST TWO TEXT MESSAGES 

3538
01:54:34,767 --> 01:54:37,070
WERE SENT BY YOU ON JULY 6, IS 

3539
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:37,437
THAT CORRECT? 

3540
01:54:37,437 --> 01:54:37,970
>> CORRECT. 

3541
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:40,673
>> THE LAST WAS ON JULY 10 SENT 

3542
01:54:40,673 --> 01:54:40,940
BY YOU? 

3543
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:41,273
>> CORRECT. 

3544
01:54:41,273 --> 01:54:42,909
>> ARE THOSE THREE COMMENTS 

3545
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:45,611
ACCURATE? 

3546
01:54:45,611 --> 01:54:46,479
>> I WILL READ THEM. 

3547
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:57,657
>> TAKE YOUR TIME. 

3548
01:54:57,657 --> 01:54:58,958
>> THERE IS ONE CORRECTION. 

3549
01:54:58,958 --> 01:54:59,225
>> OKAY. 

3550
01:54:59,225 --> 01:55:00,058
>> I MISUSED THE WORD BYSTANDER 

3551
01:55:00,058 --> 01:55:05,098
AS AN ADJECTIVE. 

3552
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:05,365
>> OKAY. 

3553
01:55:05,365 --> 01:55:06,332
>> BYSTANDER MEANS SOMEONE THAT 

3554
01:55:06,332 --> 01:55:12,238
IS LOOKING AT AN ASSAULT AND THE

3555
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:14,007
PERSON NAMED PJ WAS NOT 

3556
01:55:14,007 --> 01:55:14,807
TECHNICALLY A BYSTANDER. I 

3557
01:55:14,807 --> 01:55:17,477
WAS WRITING VERY QUICKLY WITH A 

3558
01:55:17,477 --> 01:55:19,012
SENSE OF URGENCY. I 

3559
01:55:19,012 --> 01:55:21,347
WOULD NOT CALL HIM A BYSTANDER. 

3560
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:22,215
HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS AND WHAT I 

3561
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:25,018
REMEMBER OF HIM, HE WAS TALL AND

3562
01:55:25,018 --> 01:55:27,620
A VERY NICE PERSON. I 

3563
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,956
DIDN'T KNOW HIM WELL. 

3564
01:55:29,956 --> 01:55:31,024
HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS, NOT ANYWHERE 

3565
01:55:31,024 --> 01:55:32,057
NEAR THE EVENT. 

3566
01:55:32,057 --> 01:55:33,392
>> THANK YOU. 

3567
01:55:33,392 --> 01:55:36,295
>> I'D LIKE TO TAKE THAT WORD 

3568
01:55:36,295 --> 01:55:38,063
OUT, IF POSSIBLE. 

3569
01:55:38,063 --> 01:55:40,333
>> THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING 

3570
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:40,733
THAT. 

3571
01:55:40,733 --> 01:55:42,101
THE SECOND IS THE LETTER THAT 

3572
01:55:42,101 --> 01:55:44,037
YOU WROTE TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN 

3573
01:55:44,037 --> 01:55:46,839
DATED JULY 30 OF THIS YEAR. 

3574
01:55:46,839 --> 01:55:47,673
DID YOU WRITE THE LETTER 

3575
01:55:47,673 --> 01:55:47,973
YOURSELF? 

3576
01:55:47,973 --> 01:55:48,574
>> I DID. 

3577
01:55:48,574 --> 01:55:49,542
>> SINCE IT'S DATED JULY 30, 

3578
01:55:49,542 --> 01:55:56,416
DID YOU WRITE IT ON THAT DATE? 

3579
01:55:56,416 --> 01:55:57,049
>> I BELIEVE SO. 

3580
01:55:57,049 --> 01:55:57,683
IT SOUNDS RIGHT. 

3581
01:55:57,683 --> 01:56:02,555
I WAS IN DELAWARE AT THE TIME. I

3582
01:56:02,555 --> 01:56:04,223
COULD LOOK INTO MY CALENDAR AND 

3583
01:56:04,223 --> 01:56:04,924
TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. 

3584
01:56:04,924 --> 01:56:06,025
>> WAS IT WRITTEN ON OR ABOUT 

3585
01:56:06,025 --> 01:56:06,893
THAT DATE? 

3586
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:12,332
>> YES. I 

3587
01:56:12,332 --> 01:56:14,266
TRAVEL, I THINK, THE 26TH OF 

3588
01:56:14,266 --> 01:56:15,034
JULY 2 DELAWARE. 

3589
01:56:15,034 --> 01:56:16,235
IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I WROTE 

3590
01:56:16,235 --> 01:56:16,602
IT FROM THERE. 

3591
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:20,572
>> IS A LETTER ACCURATE? 

3592
01:56:20,572 --> 01:56:22,775
>> I WILL TAKE A MINUTE TO READ 

3593
01:56:22,775 --> 01:56:22,941
IT. 

3594
01:56:22,941 --> 01:56:23,476
I CAN READ FAST. 

3595
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:30,416
>> TAKE YOUR TIME. 

3596
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:54,440
>> OKAY. 

3597
01:57:23,035 --> 01:57:29,075
>> OKAY. I 

3598
01:57:29,075 --> 01:57:30,209
HAVE THREE AREAS I'D LIKE TO 

3599
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:30,476
ADDRESS. 

3600
01:57:30,476 --> 01:57:30,742
>> OKAY. 

3601
01:57:30,742 --> 01:57:31,376
>> IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH, 

3602
01:57:31,376 --> 01:57:34,347
WHERE IT SAYS THE ASSAULT 

3603
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:35,715
OCCURRED IN A SUBURBAN MARYLAND 

3604
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:44,223
AREA HOME, AT A GATHERING THAT 

3605
01:57:44,223 --> 01:57:45,658
INCLUDED ME AND FOUR OTHERS, I 

3606
01:57:45,658 --> 01:57:46,225
CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THERE 

3607
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:47,192
WEREN'T A FEW OTHER PEOPLE 

3608
01:57:47,192 --> 01:57:47,827
THERE. 

3609
01:57:47,827 --> 01:57:52,665
THEY ARE NOT IN MY PURVIEW OF 

3610
01:57:52,665 --> 01:57:52,965
MY MEMORY. 

3611
01:57:52,965 --> 01:57:56,035
>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY 

3612
01:57:56,035 --> 01:57:57,570
THERE WERE AT LEAST FOUR 

3613
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:57,803
OTHERS? 

3614
01:57:57,803 --> 01:57:58,704
>> YES. 

3615
01:57:58,704 --> 01:57:59,739
>> OKAY. 

3616
01:57:59,739 --> 01:58:01,807
>> WHAT IS THE SECOND 

3617
01:58:01,807 --> 01:58:02,108
CORRECTION? 

3618
01:58:02,108 --> 01:58:03,776
>> THE NEXT SENTENCE BEGINS 

3619
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:05,044
WITH KAVANAUGH PHYSICALLY 

3620
01:58:05,044 --> 01:58:06,646
PUSHED ME INTO THE BEDROOM. 

3621
01:58:06,646 --> 01:58:08,648
I WOULD SAY I CAN'T PROMISE 

3622
01:58:08,648 --> 01:58:10,016
THAT MARK JUDGE DIDN'T ASSIST 

3623
01:58:10,016 --> 01:58:11,017
WITH THAT. I 

3624
01:58:11,017 --> 01:58:11,317
DON'T KNOW. 

3625
01:58:11,317 --> 01:58:14,020
I WAS PUSHED FROM BEHIND. I 

3626
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:15,654
DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT FULLY ON 

3627
01:58:15,654 --> 01:58:16,122
HIM. 

3628
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:16,622
>> OKAY. 

3629
01:58:16,622 --> 01:58:18,324
>> MS. MITCHELL, I DON'T KNOW 

3630
01:58:18,324 --> 01:58:19,859
WHETHER IT'S FAIR TO ME TO 

3631
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:20,993
INTERRUPT BUT I WANT TO KEEP 

3632
01:58:20,993 --> 01:58:22,428
PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. 

3633
01:58:22,428 --> 01:58:24,330
IS THAT A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR YOU 

3634
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:26,432
IN THE MIDDLE OF A QUESTION? 

3635
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:29,302
BECAUSE, WE'VE GOT TO -- I'VE 

3636
01:58:29,302 --> 01:58:31,337
GOT TO TREAT EVERYBODY THE 

3637
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:31,537
SAME. 

3638
01:58:31,537 --> 01:58:32,037
>> A UNDERSTAND THAT. 

3639
01:58:32,037 --> 01:58:35,007
>> CANNOT GO TO SENATOR 

3640
01:58:35,007 --> 01:58:36,008
FEINSTEIN? 

3641
01:58:36,008 --> 01:58:36,742
>> YES, SIR. 

3642
01:58:36,742 --> 01:58:37,042
I'M SORRY. 

3643
01:58:37,042 --> 01:58:37,342
PLEASE DO. 

3644
01:58:37,342 --> 01:58:38,778
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN? 

3645
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:42,148
>> WE WILL COME BACK TO THAT. 

3646
01:58:42,148 --> 01:58:45,584
>> OKAY. 

3647
01:58:45,584 --> 01:59:09,809
>> 

3648
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:12,712
. 

3649
01:59:12,712 --> 01:59:14,313
>>> A THOUSAND FEMALE 

3650
01:59:14,313 --> 01:59:16,214
PHYSICIANS CHOOSE THE COUNTRY 

3651
01:59:16,214 --> 01:59:18,884
THOSE ARE WHAT THE LETTERS ARE. 

3652
01:59:18,884 --> 01:59:21,487
I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 

3653
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:32,031
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.       

3654
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:33,332
WHY HAVE YOU HELD IT TO 

3655
01:59:33,332 --> 01:59:35,234
YOURSELF ALL THESE YEARS? 

3656
01:59:35,234 --> 01:59:37,103
ASYOU LOOK BACK  CAN YOU 

3657
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:43,342
INDICATE WHAT THE REASONS ARE?  

3658
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:46,913
. 

3659
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:47,513
>>WELL, I DID DISCLOSE IT IN 

3660
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:50,082
THE CONFINES OF THERAPY WHERE I 

3661
01:59:50,082 --> 01:59:53,386
FELT LIKE IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE 

3662
01:59:53,386 --> 01:59:56,822
PLACE TO COPE WITH THE EVENT. 

3663
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:59,592
>> WELL, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT 

3664
01:59:59,592 --> 02:00:03,562
IMPACT THE EVENTS HAD ON YOU? 

3665
02:00:03,562 --> 02:00:06,799
>> WELL, I THINK IT VARIES BY 

3666
02:00:06,799 --> 02:00:07,032
PERSON. 

3667
02:00:07,032 --> 02:00:10,635
SO FOR ME PERSONALLYANXIETY, 

3668
02:00:10,635 --> 02:00:13,940
PHOBIA, AND PTSD-LIKE SYMPTOMS 

3669
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:16,242
ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT 

3670
02:00:16,242 --> 02:00:17,877
I'VE BEEN COPING WITH. 

3671
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:19,011
SOMORE SPECIFICALLY PANIC AND 

3672
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:20,813
THAT TYPE OF THING. 

3673
02:00:20,813 --> 02:00:23,549
>> IS THAT THE REASON FOR THE 

3674
02:00:23,549 --> 02:00:29,755
SECOND DOOR, FRONT DOOR? 

3675
02:00:29,755 --> 02:00:30,322
>> CORRECT, CORRECT -- OUR 

3676
02:00:30,322 --> 02:00:31,089
HOUSE DOES NOT LOOK AS AT THE 

3677
02:00:31,089 --> 02:00:32,058
TIME COLLEAGUE PLEASING FROM 

3678
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:32,725
THE CURB. 

3679
02:00:32,725 --> 02:00:34,259
>> AND DO YOU HAVE THAT SECOND 

3680
02:00:34,259 --> 02:00:36,729
FRONT DOOR? 

3681
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:37,029
>> YES.  

3682
02:00:37,029 --> 02:00:38,831
IT NOW IS A PLACE TO HOST 

3683
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:39,231
GOOGLE INTERNS. 

3684
02:00:39,231 --> 02:00:41,500
WE LIVENEAR GOOGLE SO WE GET TO 

3685
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,836
-- OTHER STUDENTS -- 

3686
02:00:43,836 --> 02:00:46,305
>> CAN YOU TELL US, IS THERE 

3687
02:00:46,305 --> 02:00:46,939
ANY OTHER WAY THIS HAS AFFECTED 

3688
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:48,374
YOUR LIFE? 

3689
02:00:48,374 --> 02:00:52,444
>> UM, THE  PRIMARY IMPACT WAS 

3690
02:00:52,444 --> 02:00:57,383
IN THE INITIAL 4 YEARS AFTER 

3691
02:00:57,383 --> 02:00:58,684
THE EVENT. 

3692
02:00:58,684 --> 02:01:01,854
UM, I STRUGGLED ACADEMICALLY, I 

3693
02:01:01,854 --> 02:01:02,487
STRUGGLED VERY MUCH IN CHAPEL 

3694
02:01:02,487 --> 02:01:04,389
HILL IN COLLEGE WHEN I WAS 17 

3695
02:01:04,389 --> 02:01:07,026
AND WENT OFF TO COLLEGE I HAD A 

3696
02:01:07,026 --> 02:01:08,127
VERY HARD TIME, UM, MORE SO 

3697
02:01:08,127 --> 02:01:10,730
THAN OTHERS.     

3698
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:12,665
FORMING NEW FRIENDSHIPS AND 

3699
02:01:12,665 --> 02:01:13,232
ESPECIALLY FRIENDSHIPS WITH 

3700
02:01:13,232 --> 02:01:17,870
BOYS.      

3701
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:25,077
AND I HAD ACADEMIC PROBLEMS  . 

3702
02:01:25,077 --> 02:01:29,382
>> WHAT WERE THE -- [INAUDIBLE] 

3703
02:01:29,382 --> 02:01:31,150
WHEN -- WHEN WE SPOKE AND IT 

3704
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:32,017
BECAME VERY CLEAR HOW DEEPLY 

3705
02:01:32,017 --> 02:01:35,888
YOU FELT ABOUT THIS,  AND THE 

3706
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:36,656
NEED THAT YOU WANTED TO REMAIN 

3707
02:01:36,656 --> 02:01:36,989
CONFIDENTIAL. 

3708
02:01:36,989 --> 02:01:38,557
>> UM-HUM. 

3709
02:01:38,557 --> 02:01:40,025
>> CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT 

3710
02:01:40,025 --> 02:01:42,728
ABOUT THAT?  

3711
02:01:42,728 --> 02:01:42,861
. 

3712
02:01:42,861 --> 02:01:43,095
>> YES. 

3713
02:01:43,095 --> 02:01:45,997
SO  I WAS WATCHING CAREFULLY 

3714
02:01:45,997 --> 02:01:49,969
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER  -- WELL, 

3715
02:01:49,969 --> 02:01:51,003
MY OR NOT INTENT I JUST WANT TO 

3716
02:01:51,003 --> 02:01:53,806
REMIND IS TO COMMUNICATE WITH 

3717
02:01:53,806 --> 02:01:55,007
EVERYONE WHEN THERE WAS STILL A 

3718
02:01:55,007 --> 02:01:56,041
LIST OF CANDIDATES WHO ALL 

3719
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:59,011
SEEMED TO BE JUST FROM MY 

3720
02:01:59,011 --> 02:02:01,714
PERSPECTIVE FROM WHAT I COULD 

3721
02:02:01,714 --> 02:02:02,247
READ EQUALLY QUALIFIED.  

3722
02:02:02,247 --> 02:02:05,451
I WAS IN A HURRY TO TRY TO GET 

3723
02:02:05,451 --> 02:02:06,919
THE INFORMATION FORWARD BUT 

3724
02:02:06,919 --> 02:02:07,519
DIDN'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO DO 

3725
02:02:07,519 --> 02:02:07,920
THAT. 

3726
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:11,056
HOWEVER, ONCEHE WAS SELECTED 

3727
02:02:11,056 --> 02:02:13,559
AND SEEMED LIKE HE WAS POPULAR 

3728
02:02:13,559 --> 02:02:14,059
AND A SURE VOTE, I WAS 

3729
02:02:14,059 --> 02:02:16,328
CALCULATING DAILY  THE RISK 

3730
02:02:16,328 --> 02:02:17,062
BENEFIT FOR ME OF COMING 

3731
02:02:17,062 --> 02:02:20,065
FORWARD.     

3732
02:02:20,065 --> 02:02:23,035
AND WONDERING WHETHER I WOULD 

3733
02:02:23,035 --> 02:02:25,237
JUST BE JUMPING IN FRONT OF A 

3734
02:02:25,237 --> 02:02:25,871
TRAIN THAT WAS HEADED TO WHERE 

3735
02:02:25,871 --> 02:02:29,441
IT WAS HEADED ANY WAY AND THAT 

3736
02:02:29,441 --> 02:02:30,643
I WOULD JUST BE PERSONALLY -- 

3737
02:02:30,643 --> 02:02:31,277
>> HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO COME 

3738
02:02:31,277 --> 02:02:33,045
FORWARD?    

3739
02:02:33,045 --> 02:02:33,178
. 

3740
02:02:33,178 --> 02:02:35,614
>> ULTIMATELY BECAUSE  

3741
02:02:35,614 --> 02:02:37,883
REPORTERS WERE SITTING OUTSIDE 

3742
02:02:37,883 --> 02:02:40,920
OF MY HOME TRYING TO TALK TO MY 

3743
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,921
DOG THROUGH THE WINDOW, UM TO 

3744
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:46,425
CALM THE DOG DOWN AND A  

3745
02:02:46,425 --> 02:02:47,126
REPORTER APPEARED IN MY 

3746
02:02:47,126 --> 02:02:48,928
GRADUATE CLASSROOM AND I 

3747
02:02:48,928 --> 02:02:50,229
MISTOOK HER FOR A STUDENT.    

3748
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:52,831
AND SHE CAME UP TO ASK ME A 

3749
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:54,900
QUESTION, AND I  THOUGHT THAT 

3750
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:55,333
SHE WAS A STUDENT. 

3751
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:57,203
AND IT TURNED OUTTHAT SHE WAS A 

3752
02:02:57,203 --> 02:02:59,972
REPORTER.     

3753
02:02:59,972 --> 02:03:02,040
SO AT THAT POINT I FELT LIKE 

3754
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,076
ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH. 

3755
02:03:04,076 --> 02:03:06,979
PEOPLE WERE CALLING MY 

3756
02:03:06,979 --> 02:03:08,647
COLLEAGUES AND LEAVING MESSAGES 

3757
02:03:08,647 --> 02:03:11,416
ON THEIR VOICE MAILS AND EMAILS 

3758
02:03:11,416 --> 02:03:12,718
SAY THEY KNEW MY NAME. 

3759
02:03:12,718 --> 02:03:14,053
CLEARLYPEOPLE KNEW INTO ADDRESS 

3760
02:03:14,053 --> 02:03:15,087
BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT IN FRONT 

3761
02:03:15,087 --> 02:03:18,190
OF MY HOUSE AND THE MOUNTING 

3762
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:18,824
PRESSURE IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS 

3763
02:03:18,824 --> 02:03:20,225
TIME TO JUST SAY WHAT I NEEDED 

3764
02:03:20,225 --> 02:03:20,459
TO SAY. 

3765
02:03:20,459 --> 02:03:21,460
>> I'M SORRY.    

3766
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:25,898
I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION  

3767
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:31,470
ABOUT THE ATTACK ITSELF.      

3768
02:03:31,470 --> 02:03:33,806
UM, YOU WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT 

3769
02:03:33,806 --> 02:03:37,943
THE ATTACK BEING PUSHED INTO 

3770
02:03:37,943 --> 02:03:39,978
THE ROOM, YOU SAY YOU DON'T 

3771
02:03:39,978 --> 02:03:42,515
KNOW QUITE BY WHOM. 

3772
02:03:42,515 --> 02:03:44,583
BUT THAT IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH 

3773
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:47,185
THAT COVERED YOUR MOUTH TO 

3774
02:03:47,185 --> 02:03:49,555
PREVENT YOU FROM SCREAMING, UM, 

3775
02:03:49,555 --> 02:03:50,022
AND THEN YOU ESCAPED. 

3776
02:03:50,022 --> 02:03:52,591
HOW AREYOU SO SURE THAT IT WAS 

3777
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:54,727
HE?    

3778
02:03:54,727 --> 02:03:54,860
. 

3779
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:58,030
>> THE SAME WAY THAT I'M SURE 

3780
02:03:58,030 --> 02:04:00,466
THAT I'M TALKING TO YOU RIGHT 

3781
02:04:00,466 --> 02:04:01,433
NOW. 

3782
02:04:01,433 --> 02:04:02,100
JUST BASIC MEMORYFUNCTIONS AND

WAS ALLOWED TO STAY OUT.  

3965
02:09:16,781 --> 02:09:17,749

GATHERING. 

3967
02:09:18,584 --> 02:09:21,854

>> OKAY. 

3977
02:09:38,103 --> 02:09:38,904
SO THERE WASN'T ASTEREO PLAYING 

3978

3979
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:41,506

WAY TO DO THAT ASK THE FBI TO

3992
02:10:06,565 --> 02:10:08,834

ANITA HILL. 

4006
02:10:39,731 --> 02:10:42,935
I'M CONCERNED WE'RE DOINGA LOT 

4007
02:10:42,935 --> 02:10:44,636
LESS FOR THESE 3 WOMEN TODAY, 

4008
02:10:44,636 --> 02:10:46,271

4010
02:10:47,272 --> 02:10:49,207

4019
02:11:07,059 --> 02:11:07,526
BRAVERY IS CONTAGIOUS.

4020

INDEED THAT'S THE DRIVING FORCE 

4021
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:10,862
BEHIND THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. 

4022

UM,I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE HIM 

4512
02:26:02,153 --> 02:26:04,522
AS NOT FRIENDLY. 

4513
02:26:04,522 --> 02:26:06,924
HE WAS JUSTNERVOUS AND NOT 

4514
02:26:06,924 --> 02:26:07,858
REALLY WANTING TO SPEAK WITH 

4515
02:26:07,858 --> 02:26:08,025

AFTER THE INCIDENT? 

4519
02:26:12,430 --> 02:26:13,797

HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS 

4537
02:26:44,061 --> 02:26:45,663
SITUATION.     

4538
02:26:45,663 --> 02:26:47,197

4539
02:26:47,197 --> 02:26:50,701
PROTECTED.      

4540
02:26:50,701 --> 02:26:53,004

WE'LL TAKE A BREAK NOW FOR 15 

4547
02:27:02,647 --> 02:27:17,662

THAT I THOUGHT OF AS I WAS

02:27:59,103 --> 02:27:59,703
LISTENING TO DR. FORD IS I'M 

4570
02:27:59,703 --> 02:28:02,807

4571
02:28:02,807 --> 02:28:04,275
REPUBLICAN, THAT THIS IS -- 

4572
02:28:04,275 --> 02:28:04,909
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OPTICS 

4573
02:28:04,909 --> 02:28:05,109
HERE. 

4574
02:28:05,109 --> 02:28:06,811
>>  YEAH. 

4575
02:28:06,811 --> 02:28:07,411
>> AS YOU LISTEN TO DR. FORD 

4576
02:28:07,411 --> 02:28:10,447
AND LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAS TO 

4577
02:28:10,447 --> 02:28:11,649
SAY, AND THAT COMES FROM THE 

4578
02:28:11,649 --> 02:28:15,452
QUESTIONS THAT  RACHEL MITCHEL 

4579
02:28:15,452 --> 02:28:18,256
IS ASKING AND QUESTIONS THAT 

4580
02:28:18,256 --> 02:28:18,923
THE DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING, IT IS 

4581
02:28:18,923 --> 02:28:20,824
ABSOLUTELY HEART BREAKING TO 

4582
02:28:20,824 --> 02:28:23,160
HEAR HER SAY THAT THE MOST 

4583
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:26,330
SERVING MEMORY THAT SHE STILL 

4584
02:28:26,330 --> 02:28:27,398
HAS FROM THE NIGHT SHE ALLEGES 

4585
02:28:27,398 --> 02:28:30,934
BRETT KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED HER 

4586
02:28:30,934 --> 02:28:31,335
WAS THE LAUGHTER. 

4587
02:28:31,335 --> 02:28:34,005
WHEN SENATORFINESTEIN ASKED HER 

4588
02:28:34,005 --> 02:28:35,673
SHE BASICALLY SAID BASIC MEMORY 

4589
02:28:35,673 --> 02:28:36,206
FUNCTION, I REMEMBER THAT 

4590
02:28:36,206 --> 02:28:39,977
NIGHT. 

4591
02:28:39,977 --> 02:28:41,678

AND SHE WAS 15 ATTHE TIME. 

4594
02:28:42,813 --> 02:28:44,048
I THINK WE NEED TOREMEMBER THAT 

4595
02:28:44,048 --> 02:28:44,314
AS WELL. 

4596
02:28:44,314 --> 02:28:47,018
BECAUSEWE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

4597
02:28:47,018 --> 02:28:49,587
THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF WELL, 

4598
02:28:49,587 --> 02:28:50,187
THIS WAS 35 YEARS AGO. 

4599
02:28:50,187 --> 02:28:53,290
THINK WHEN YOU'REA 15-YEAR OLD 

4600
02:28:53,290 --> 02:28:53,924
GIRL, WHAT THAT KIND OF MEMORY 

4601
02:28:53,924 --> 02:28:56,260
AND THAT KIND OF  -- IDEA THAT 

4602
02:28:56,260 --> 02:28:59,030
THERE WAS LAUGHTER, WHAT THAT 

4603
02:28:59,030 --> 02:29:00,297
CAN DO TO A PERSON. 

4604
02:29:00,297 --> 02:29:02,433
AND SHE WAS ASKED, KINDOF WHAT 

4605
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:06,837
WERE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU 

4606
02:29:06,837 --> 02:29:07,170
IN YOUR LIFE. 

4607
02:29:07,170 --> 02:29:10,841
SHETALKED ABOUT ANXIETY, PTSD, 

4608
02:29:10,841 --> 02:29:11,408
PANIC, THE INITIAL 4 YEARS 

4609
02:29:11,408 --> 02:29:11,975
AFTER THIS WHILE SHE WAS A 

4610
02:29:11,975 --> 02:29:15,111
STUDENT IN COLLEGE. 

4611
02:29:15,111 --> 02:29:16,881
SHE STRUGGLEDACADEMICALLY AND 

4612
02:29:16,881 --> 02:29:19,016
ALSO SAID SPEAKING TO THE 

4613
02:29:19,016 --> 02:29:20,151
QUESTION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

4614
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:23,020
RAISED ABOUT WHY DIDN'T YOU 

4615
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:25,222
TALK ABOUT THIS EARLIER, WHY 

4616
02:29:25,222 --> 02:29:25,855
DIDN'T YOU COME FORWARD AT THE 

4617
02:29:25,855 --> 02:29:26,190
TIME.

02:29:26,190 --> 02:29:27,157
SHE TALKEDABOUT THE WAY IN 

4619
02:29:27,157 --> 02:29:30,394
WHICH SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL 

4620
02:29:30,394 --> 02:29:31,128
HER PARENTS SHE WAS AT A PARTY 

4621
02:29:31,128 --> 02:29:32,663
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN DRINKING. 

4622
02:29:32,663 --> 02:29:34,098
>>  THERE WAS A QUESTIONTHERE 

4623
02:29:34,098 --> 02:29:37,768
-- THE SENATOR IS MAKING HIS 

4624
02:29:37,768 --> 02:29:38,368
WAY OUT OF THE BRIEFING ROOM 

4625
02:29:38,368 --> 02:29:38,935
WITH OTHER SENATORS AND I 

4626
02:29:38,935 --> 02:29:41,305
DIDN'T HEAR WHAT THE QUESTION 

4627
02:29:41,305 --> 02:29:43,007
WAS AND WHAT HE RESPONDED. 

4628
02:29:43,007 --> 02:29:44,208
WE'REKEEPING AN EYE OUT ON 

4629
02:29:44,208 --> 02:29:45,543
THAT. 

4630
02:29:45,543 --> 02:29:48,479
YOU'RE RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW, 

4631
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:49,079
THIS -- THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN 

4632
02:29:49,079 --> 02:29:49,547
ISSUE. 

4633
02:29:49,547 --> 02:29:50,114
THIS IS CLEARLY A WOMANWHO 

4634
02:29:50,114 --> 02:29:53,283
APPEARS  TO  HAVE SUFFERED 

4635
02:29:53,283 --> 02:29:54,919
SOMETHING HONORABLE 36 YEARS 

4636
02:29:54,919 --> 02:29:55,952
AGO AND IS BEING ASKED TO 

4637
02:29:55,952 --> 02:29:56,286
RECOUNT THAT. 

4638
02:29:56,286 --> 02:29:57,354

4639
02:29:57,354 --> 02:29:58,956
>> IN FRONT OF A ROOM FULL OF 

4640
02:29:58,956 --> 02:30:01,058
PEOPLE. 

4641
02:30:01,058 --> 02:30:04,061
>> YOU KNOW, AS I WAS WATCHING 

4642
02:30:04,061 --> 02:30:06,297
RACHEL MITCHELL WHICH WE KNOW 

4643
02:30:06,297 --> 02:30:09,100
HER JOB IS SORT OF A TOUGH ONE. 

4644
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:10,501
I THOUGHT SHE'S PERFORMING AS 

4645
02:30:10,501 --> 02:30:11,669
BEST SHE CAN UNDER THE 

4646
02:30:11,669 --> 02:30:13,370
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

4647
02:30:13,370 --> 02:30:14,138
TALK ABOUT THEOPTICS, WHAT I 

4648
02:30:14,138 --> 02:30:15,105
KEPT ON THINKING IS WHY DOES 

4649
02:30:15,105 --> 02:30:17,742
THIS WOMAN HAVE TO DO THIS? 

4650
02:30:17,742 --> 02:30:18,909
I THOUGHT INITIALLYGOING INTO 

4651
02:30:18,909 --> 02:30:20,044
THIS THE CONCERN ABOUT THE 

4652
02:30:20,044 --> 02:30:20,644
OPTICS WOULD BE THE 

4653
02:30:20,644 --> 02:30:22,479
REPUBLICANS, THEY HAD TO BRING 

4654
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:23,113
THIS WOMAN BECAUSE THEY 

4655
02:30:23,113 --> 02:30:25,616
COULDN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN. 

4656
02:30:25,616 --> 02:30:26,149
NOW, IT'SSORT OF LIKE THE 

4657
02:30:26,149 --> 02:30:29,120
ENTIRE COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW, WHY 

4658
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:31,055
DOES SHE HAVE -- IT'S CLEAR 

4659
02:30:31,055 --> 02:30:31,588
THAT IT'S PAINFUL. 

4660
02:30:31,588 --> 02:30:37,228
UM -- AND SHE'S COMINGACROSS TO 

4661
02:30:37,228 --> 02:30:38,729
ME, AS CREDIBLE, SHE'S

02:30:38,729 --> 02:30:40,097
REMEMBERING THESE DETAILS, AND 

4663
02:30:40,097 --> 02:30:43,433
IT JUST DOESN'T -- I DON'T KNOW 

4664
02:30:43,433 --> 02:30:44,402
WHAT WE'RE GAINING FROM ANOTHER 

4665
02:30:44,402 --> 02:30:48,239
SEVERAL HOURS OF THIS.

THE QUESTION, UM, OR THE MEMORY 

4681
02:31:17,902 --> 02:31:19,936
THAT SHE SAYS  HAPPENED THAT 

4682
02:31:19,936 --> 02:31:20,170
NIGHT? 

4683
02:31:20,170 --> 02:31:21,572
I MEAN -- 

4684
02:31:21,572 --> 02:31:22,205
>> FIRST OF ALL IT FEELS LIKE A 

4685
02:31:22,205 --> 02:31:23,607
TRIAL. 

4686
02:31:23,607 --> 02:31:26,110
>>  UM-HUM. 

4687
02:31:26,110 --> 02:31:27,678
>> SHE'S CROSS EXAMINING. 

4688
02:31:27,678 --> 02:31:32,149
>> CROSS EXAMINATION. 

4689
02:31:32,149 --> 02:31:34,318
>> I THINK WHAT MITCHELL IS 

4690
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:35,219
DOING -- [INAUDIBLE] 

4691
02:31:35,219 --> 02:31:36,787
FORD FEEL COMFORTABLE SETTING 

4692
02:31:36,787 --> 02:31:37,955
PARAMETERS AND SETTING 

4693
02:31:37,955 --> 02:31:38,555
GUIDELINES FOR HOW TO RESPOND 

4694
02:31:38,555 --> 02:31:39,122
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS 

4695
02:31:39,122 --> 02:31:41,025
ACCURATE AND OF COURSE THIS IS 

4696
02:31:41,025 --> 02:31:42,826
ALL GOING ON THE RECORD AND IS 

4697
02:31:42,826 --> 02:31:45,429
UNDER OATH, WHAT I THINK SHE'S 

4698
02:31:45,429 --> 02:31:45,929
TRYING TO DO IS KIND OF 

4699
02:31:45,929 --> 02:31:47,831
ESTABLISH  THE BASIC FACTS OF 

4700
02:31:47,831 --> 02:31:51,835
THE CASE HERE.    

4701
02:31:51,835 --> 02:31:53,770
UM, AND IT IS AN AWKWARD FORMAT 

4702
02:31:53,770 --> 02:31:55,072
BECAUSE SHE'S GIVEN 5 MINUTES 

4703
02:31:55,072 --> 02:31:58,175
TO DO SO AND THEN SHIFT TO THE 

4704
02:31:58,175 --> 02:31:59,009
DEMOCRATIC SIDE SO THEY CAN ASK 

4705
02:31:59,009 --> 02:31:59,309
QUESTIONS. 

4706
02:31:59,309 --> 02:32:01,512
I'MWONDERING IF SHE WERE 

4707
02:32:01,512 --> 02:32:02,146
ALLOWED, YOU KNOW, MORE TIME TO 

4708
02:32:02,146 --> 02:32:06,684
ESTABLISH THESE FACTS AND DO 

4709
02:32:06,684 --> 02:32:07,284
THESE -- CONDUCT THIS LINE OF 

4710
02:32:07,284 --> 02:32:10,687
QUESTIONS THAT SHE HAS AROUND 

4711
02:32:10,687 --> 02:32:11,288
BASIC FACTS OF THE CASE AND 

4712
02:32:11,288 --> 02:32:13,557
THEN GO TO THE OTHER QUESTIONS, 

4713
02:32:13,557 --> 02:32:15,759
IT'S AN AWKWARD FORMAT. 

4714
02:32:15,759 --> 02:32:16,560
>> IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE YOU'RE 

4715
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:17,962
CROSS EXAMINING. 

4716
02:32:17,962 --> 02:32:20,564
>> BACK AND FORTH, BACK INTO 

4717
02:32:20,564 --> 02:32:21,698
THAT MEMORY, BACK INTO NOW AND 

4718
02:32:21,698 --> 02:32:23,667
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS. 

4719
02:32:23,667 --> 02:32:25,469
>>  THE DEMOCRATS ARE ON A

4720
02:32:25,469 --> 02:32:26,236
DIFFERENT ADEPEND IT. 

4721
02:32:26,236 --> 02:32:27,304
FOR THEMTHE FACTS ARE WHAT SHE 

4722
02:32:27,304 --> 02:32:27,871
SAYS. 

4723
02:32:27,871 --> 02:32:29,373
>>  RIGHT. 

4724
02:32:29,373 --> 02:32:29,940
>> AND FINE WITH WHAT SHE'S 

4725
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:30,240
PRESENTED. 

4726
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,875
>> RIGHT. 

4727
02:32:31,875 --> 02:32:33,477
>> SO THEY'RE TRYING TO SORT OF 

4728
02:32:33,477 --> 02:32:38,048
CREATE SORT OF A DIFFERENT -- 

4729
02:32:38,048 --> 02:32:40,050
NOT A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE BUT 

4730
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:40,684
TRYING TO FLESH OUT THE IMPACT 

4731
02:32:40,684 --> 02:32:40,951
OF THIS. 

4732
02:32:40,951 --> 02:32:42,453
>> RIGHT. 

4733
02:32:42,453 --> 02:32:43,887
>> THEN YOU HAVE THIS FACT 

4734
02:32:43,887 --> 02:32:44,521
FINDING MISSION, WELL THEN, 

4735
02:32:44,521 --> 02:32:47,057
WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN? 

4736
02:32:47,057 --> 02:32:49,994
WELL, WEDON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

4737
02:32:49,994 --> 02:32:50,628
ENTIRE NARRATIVE IS BECAUSE WE 

4738
02:32:50,628 --> 02:32:53,330
HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FACT 

4739
02:32:53,330 --> 02:32:53,663
FINDING PART. 

4740
02:32:53,663 --> 02:32:55,432
IT'S VERY ODD. 

4741
02:32:55,432 --> 02:32:56,500
>> IT'S WHAT WE SAID, RIGHT, A 

4742
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:59,270
CROSS EXAMINATION WHICH SOUNDS 

4743
02:32:59,270 --> 02:33:00,337
AS IF YOU'RE PUTTING A VICTIM 

4744
02:33:00,337 --> 02:33:02,039
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON TRIAL. 

4745
02:33:02,039 --> 02:33:02,640
>>  RIGHT. 

4746
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:03,407
>> AND THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY 

4747
02:33:03,407 --> 02:33:06,777
A GOOD LOOK. 

4748
02:33:06,777 --> 02:33:07,310
LET'S PLAY A LITTLEBIT -- 

4749
02:33:07,310 --> 02:33:07,611
[INAUDIBLE] 

4750
02:33:07,611 --> 02:33:09,212
PLAY OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

4751
02:33:09,212 --> 02:33:11,048
LAST HALF HOUR OR SO.  

4752
02:33:11,048 --> 02:33:13,250
SOUND BITE NUMBER 3.  ITTAKES 

4753
02:33:13,250 --> 02:33:14,585
US BACK TO THE NIGHT THAT DR. 

4754
02:33:14,585 --> 02:33:16,019
FORD SAYS  BRETT KAVANAUGH  AND 

4755
02:33:16,019 --> 02:33:20,190
MARK JUDGE  UM,  -- WHERE SHE 

4756
02:33:20,190 --> 02:33:22,927
FOUND HERSELF IN THIS ROOM WITH 

4757
02:33:22,927 --> 02:33:24,395
THESE 2 MEN. 

4758
02:33:24,395 --> 02:33:26,897
I WANT TO PLAY THAT. 

4759
02:33:26,897 --> 02:33:30,968
>> HE GROPED ME AND TRIED TO 

4760
02:33:30,968 --> 02:33:31,435
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. 

4761
02:33:31,435 --> 02:33:34,804
HE HAD AHARD TIME BECAUSE HE 

4762
02:33:34,804 --> 02:33:35,438
WAS -- AND I WAS WEARING A ONE 

4763
02:33:35,438 --> 02:33:37,841
PIECE BATHING SUIT UNDERNEATH 

4764
02:33:37,841 --> 02:33:38,174
MY CLOTHING. 

4765
02:33:38,174 --> 02:33:40,644
I BELIEVED HE WASGOING TO RAPE 

4766
02:33:40,644 --> 02:33:40,811
ME. 

4767
02:33:40,811 --> 02:33:46,250
I TRIED TOYELL FOR HELP. 

4768
02:33:46,250 --> 02:33:46,883
WHEN I DID HEPUT HIS HAND OVER 

4769
02:33:46,883 --> 02:33:48,018
MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM 

4770
02:33:48,018 --> 02:33:49,386
YELLING. 

4771
02:33:49,386 --> 02:33:50,154
THIS ISWHAT TERRIFIED ME THE 

4772
02:33:50,154 --> 02:33:51,355
MOST AND HAD THE MOST LASTING 

4773
02:33:51,355 --> 02:33:52,756
IMPACT ON MY LIFE.  

4774
02:33:52,756 --> 02:33:55,726
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE.  

4775
02:33:55,726 --> 02:33:59,697
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 

4776
02:33:59,697 --> 02:34:04,535
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME. 

4777
02:34:04,535 --> 02:34:06,470
BOTH BRETT AND MARK WERE 

4778
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:07,404
DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE 

4779
02:34:07,404 --> 02:34:08,072
ATTACK. 

4780
02:34:08,072 --> 02:34:10,307
THEY SEEMED TO HAVEHAVING A 

4781
02:34:10,307 --> 02:34:10,607
GOOD TIME. 

4782
02:34:10,607 --> 02:34:13,977
>>  I MEAN, FOR ME, JUST

4783
02:34:13,977 --> 02:34:17,881
LISTENING TO THAT AS A MAN, I 

4784
02:34:17,881 --> 02:34:18,514
COULD FEEL MY HEART POUNDING, I 

4785
02:34:18,514 --> 02:34:19,483
COULD FEEL IT BREAKING IN 2. 

4786
02:34:19,483 --> 02:34:21,218
>> WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 

4787
02:34:21,218 --> 02:34:22,953
THIS HEARING AND THE CONTEXT OF 

4788
02:34:22,953 --> 02:34:23,787
KIND OF THE CULTURAL MOMENT, 

4789
02:34:23,787 --> 02:34:25,322
RIGH 

4790
02:34:25,322 --> 02:34:26,090
THIS HAS BECOME MORETHAN A 

4791
02:34:26,090 --> 02:34:29,293
HEARING FOR THE NOMINATION, THE 

4792
02:34:29,293 --> 02:34:30,394
CONFIRMATION OF A SUPREME COURT 

4793
02:34:30,394 --> 02:34:30,661
JUSTICE. 

4794
02:34:30,661 --> 02:34:31,161
THISHAS TOUCHED LOTS OF 

4795
02:34:31,161 --> 02:34:35,032
DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN LOTS OF 

4796
02:34:35,032 --> 02:34:36,800
DIFFERENT WAYS, IT HAS BEEN 

4797
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:37,868
VERY IMPACTFUL, IT HAS BROUGHT 

4798
02:34:37,868 --> 02:34:39,436
UP MEMORIES FROM OTHERS TO COME 

4799
02:34:39,436 --> 02:34:41,405
FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN 

4800
02:34:41,405 --> 02:34:42,739
ASSAULTS AND WHAT THAT HAS 

4801
02:34:42,739 --> 02:34:43,206
MEANT FOR THEIR LIVE. 

4802
02:34:43,206 --> 02:34:47,010
THIS HAS TAKENON A GREATER 

4803
02:34:47,010 --> 02:34:47,644
SIGNIFICANCE IN THE COUNTRY AND 

4804
02:34:47,644 --> 02:34:50,047
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE ME 

4805
02:34:50,047 --> 02:34:53,050
TOO MOVEMENT, OF COURSE AND 

4806
02:34:53,050 --> 02:34:54,485
WHEN WE'RE KIND REVISITING HOW 

4807
02:34:54,485 --> 02:34:55,052
THESE KINDS OF THINGS WERE 

4808
02:34:55,052 --> 02:34:56,053
HANDLED IN THE PAST AND WHAT 

4809
02:34:56,053 --> 02:34:57,988
WE'RE LEARNING FROM THEM GOING 

4810
02:34:57,988 --> 02:34:58,288
FORWARD. 

4811
02:34:58,288 --> 02:34:59,022
I THINKIT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO 

4812
02:34:59,022 --> 02:35:02,192
NOTE, YOU KNOW, THAT WE HAVE 

4813
02:35:02,192 --> 02:35:05,229
HEARD TESTIMONY IN WRITTEN 

4814
02:35:05,229 --> 02:35:07,030
FORM, THIS TIME WE'RE SEEING 

4815
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:07,463
AND HEARING HER. 

4816
02:35:07,463 --> 02:35:11,434
I THINK IT IS VERY  UM -- IT 

4817
02:35:11,434 --> 02:35:12,536
GIVES A VERY -- YOU KNOW, 

4818
02:35:12,536 --> 02:35:13,136
VISCERAL REACTION. 

4819
02:35:13,136 --> 02:35:14,104
>> YES. 

4820
02:35:14,104 --> 02:35:14,771
>>  RIGHT. 

4821
02:35:14,771 --> 02:35:16,239
I THINK THAT IS VERYIMPORTANT 

4822
02:35:16,239 --> 02:35:18,408
AND THAT'S WHY LOTS OF 

4823
02:35:18,408 --> 02:35:19,076
REPUBLICANS WERE A BIT NERVOUS. 

4824
02:35:19,076 --> 02:35:20,978
>>  YES. 

4825
02:35:20,978 --> 02:35:23,046
>> ABOUT HAVING THIS -- IN THIS 

4826
02:35:23,046 --> 02:35:23,646
SETTING AND THE FACT THAT SHE 

4827
02:35:23,646 --> 02:35:26,316
IS WILLING TO SAY ALL OF THESE 

4828
02:35:26,316 --> 02:35:27,885
THINGS UNDER OATH AND ALSO SAID 

4829
02:35:27,885 --> 02:35:30,020
WHAT IS HER LEVEL OF  

4830
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:32,122
CONFIDENCE THAT SHE IS 

4831
02:35:32,122 --> 02:35:33,490
REMEMBERING THIS CORRECTLY, AND 

4832
02:35:33,490 --> 02:35:34,891
THAT IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

4833
02:35:34,891 --> 02:35:36,593
AND SHE SAID 100%. 

4834
02:35:36,593 --> 02:35:39,096
>> YEAH, I THINK, YOU KNOW, UM, 

4835
02:35:39,096 --> 02:35:40,964
ALL OF US SORT OF WHEN SHE 

4836
02:35:40,964 --> 02:35:41,899
FIRST STARTED TALKING SORT OF 

4837
02:35:41,899 --> 02:35:42,199
LOOKED UP. 

4838
02:35:42,199 --> 02:35:43,400
YOU HAVE THESE IDEAS OFWHAT 

4839
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,434
SHE'S GOING TO LOOK AND SOUND 

4840
02:35:44,434 --> 02:35:44,634
LIKE. 

4841
02:35:44,634 --> 02:35:46,904
>> RIGHT. 

4842
02:35:46,904 --> 02:35:49,172
>> I THINK IT SORT OF CAUGHT US 

4843
02:35:49,172 --> 02:35:50,441
OFF GUARD THAT SHE WAS NO 

4844
02:35:50,441 --> 02:35:52,075
LONGER AN ACCUSER, SHE'S A 

4845
02:35:52,075 --> 02:35:54,077
WOMAN, A VICTIM.     

4846
02:35:54,077 --> 02:35:55,479
I THOUGHT THE OTHER THING WE 

4847
02:35:55,479 --> 02:35:56,346
REALLY GOT OUT OF THIS 

4848
02:35:56,346 --> 02:35:58,615
TESTIMONY UM IS AN ANSWER TO 

4849
02:35:58,615 --> 02:35:59,216
THAT QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T YOU 

4850
02:35:59,216 --> 02:36:01,718
COME FORWARD SOONER IN. 

4851
02:36:01,718 --> 02:36:03,287
>> UM-HUM. 

4852
02:36:03,287 --> 02:36:06,089
>> AND SHE TALKS ABOUT THE 

4853
02:36:06,089 --> 02:36:07,257
IMPACT -- THE PRESENT DAY 

4854
02:36:07,257 --> 02:36:08,192
IMPACT HOW SHE'S BEEN 

4855
02:36:08,192 --> 02:36:10,560
RETRAUMATIZED BY THE DECISION 

4856
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:12,663
TO COME FORWARD. 

4857
02:36:12,663 --> 02:36:15,098
LET'S PLAY SLOT NUMBER 4.  YOU

4858
02:36:15,098 --> 02:36:17,201
KNOW, BEFORE SHE EVEN TALKED 

4859
02:36:17,201 --> 02:36:18,468
ABOUT THAT SHE IDENTIFIED A 

4860
02:36:18,468 --> 02:36:19,369
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INSTANCES 

4861
02:36:19,369 --> 02:36:23,006
WHEN SHE SPOKE ABOUT THIS 

4862
02:36:23,006 --> 02:36:24,608
INCIDENT, RIGHT AND EVEN DIANE 

4863
02:36:24,608 --> 02:36:26,476
FINESTEIN SAID WELL, WHY YOU 

4864
02:36:26,476 --> 02:36:27,176
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT. 

4865
02:36:27,176 --> 02:36:30,947
SHE HADTO REMIND HER I TOLD YOU 

4866
02:36:30,947 --> 02:36:31,481
I TALKED ABOUT IT SEVERAL 

4867
02:36:31,481 --> 02:36:32,616
TIMES. 

4868
02:36:32,616 --> 02:36:33,884
>> A PART FROM THE ASSAULT 

4869
02:36:33,884 --> 02:36:35,419
ITSELF THESE PAST COUPLE OF 

4870
02:36:35,419 --> 02:36:36,986
WEEKS HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST OF 

4871
02:36:36,986 --> 02:36:37,954
MY LIFE.    

4872
02:36:37,954 --> 02:36:39,857
I'VE HAD TO RELIVE THIS TRAUMA 

4873
02:36:39,857 --> 02:36:40,791
IN FRONT OF THE WORLD.    

4874
02:36:40,791 --> 02:36:43,060
AND I'VE SEEN MY LIFE PICKED 

4875
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:45,229
APART BY PEOPLE ON TELEVISION,  

4876
02:36:45,229 --> 02:36:50,100
ON TWITTER,    OTHER SOCIAL 

4877
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:51,201
MEDIA, OTHER MEDIA AND IN THIS 

4878
02:36:51,201 --> 02:36:53,070
BODY WHO HAVE NEVER MET ME OR 

4879
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:54,538
SPOKEN WITH ME.      

4880
02:36:54,538 --> 02:36:58,542
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ACTING 

4881
02:36:58,542 --> 02:36:59,075
OUT OF PARTISAN POLITICAL 

4882
02:36:59,075 --> 02:37:00,944
MOTIVES. 

4883
02:37:00,944 --> 02:37:02,813
THOSE WHO SAY THAT DO NOT KNOW 

4884
02:37:02,813 --> 02:37:04,348
ME, I AM AN INDEPENDENT PERSON 

4885
02:37:04,348 --> 02:37:06,950
AND I AM NO ONE'S PAWN.      

4886
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:08,585
MY MOTIVATION IN COMING FORWARD 

4887
02:37:08,585 --> 02:37:10,587
WAS TO BE HELPFUL.    

4888
02:37:10,587 --> 02:37:14,057
AND TO PROVIDE FACTS ABOUT HOW 

4889
02:37:14,057 --> 02:37:14,657
MR. KAVANAUGH'S ACTIONS HAVE 

4890
02:37:14,657 --> 02:37:17,027
DAMAGED MY LIFE.    

4891
02:37:17,027 --> 02:37:18,395
SO THAT YOU COULD TAKE INTO A 

4892
02:37:18,395 --> 02:37:20,731
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION AS YOU 

4893
02:37:20,731 --> 02:37:21,398
MAKE YOUR DECISION ABOUT HOW TO 

4894
02:37:21,398 --> 02:37:21,698
PROCEED.   

4895
02:37:21,698 --> 02:37:23,867
. 

4896
02:37:23,867 --> 02:37:28,205
>> SO THAT'S SORT OF INDIRECT 

4897
02:37:28,205 --> 02:37:31,408
RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S CON 

4898
02:37:31,408 --> 02:37:32,776
JOB MANTRA HE'S BEEN REPEATING 

4899
02:37:32,776 --> 02:37:35,212
OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

4900
02:37:35,212 --> 02:37:38,148
UNLIKE THETHIRD ACCUSER, WE 

4901
02:37:38,148 --> 02:37:38,916
PLAYED THAT A LITTLE BIT 

4902
02:37:38,916 --> 02:37:40,650
EARLIER, SHE DOESN'T SAY THAT, 

4903
02:37:40,650 --> 02:37:42,986
SHE JUST SAYS I'M PUTTING IT 

4904
02:37:42,986 --> 02:37:44,120
OUT THERE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER 

4905
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:46,590
ANSWERED OF STORY. 

4906
02:37:46,590 --> 02:37:48,425
>> SHE'S MAKING CLEAR THAT SHE 

4907
02:37:48,425 --> 02:37:49,860
NEVER WANTED TO OR INTENDED TO 

4908
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:51,128
BE PART OF THIS STORY, TO BE 

4909
02:37:51,128 --> 02:37:51,595
THE STORY. 

4910
02:37:51,595 --> 02:37:53,664
>> YES. 

4911
02:37:53,664 --> 02:37:56,500
>> SHE SAID SHE BROUGHT THIS UP 

4912
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:57,534
IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER AND 

4913
02:37:57,534 --> 02:37:59,269
COMMUNICATED IT WHILE BRETT 

4914
02:37:59,269 --> 02:38:02,305
KAVANAUGH WAS STILL ON THE 

4915
02:38:02,305 --> 02:38:03,139
LIST, NOT WHILE HE WAS THE 

4916
02:38:03,139 --> 02:38:03,473
NOMINEE. 

4917
02:38:03,473 --> 02:38:05,475
HER POINT OF VIEW IS SHE WAS 

4918
02:38:05,475 --> 02:38:07,310
TRYING TO BE INFORMATIVE TO 

4919
02:38:07,310 --> 02:38:08,812
WHOEVER SHE COULD TELL IN TERMS 

4920
02:38:08,812 --> 02:38:10,179
OF WHO WOULD BE OVERSEEING THIS 

4921
02:38:10,179 --> 02:38:10,947
DECISION MAKING TO PICK BRETT 

4922
02:38:10,947 --> 02:38:11,481
KAVANAUGH OUT OF THE LST. 

4923
02:38:11,481 --> 02:38:12,749
>> RIGHT. 

4924
02:38:12,749 --> 02:38:14,317
>> UM, SO I THINK THAT TIME 

4925
02:38:14,317 --> 02:38:14,918
LINE IS IMPORTANT. 

4926
02:38:14,918 --> 02:38:16,753
AND SHE TALKSABOUT WHY SHE 

4927
02:38:16,753 --> 02:38:18,288
DIDN'T COME FORWARD AT THE 

4928
02:38:18,288 --> 02:38:18,488
TIME. 

4929
02:38:18,488 --> 02:38:19,088
I THINKIT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK 

4930
02:38:19,088 --> 02:38:20,190
ABOUT WHY SHE DIDN'T WANT HER 

4931
02:38:20,190 --> 02:38:22,426
NAME OUT THERE FOR THIS VERY 

4932
02:38:22,426 --> 02:38:22,659
REASON. 

4933
02:38:22,659 --> 02:38:23,193
SHETALKED ABOUT REPORTERS 

4934
02:38:23,193 --> 02:38:26,029
COMING TO HER HOUSE.     

4935
02:38:26,029 --> 02:38:28,298
TALKING TO HER DOG, COMING TO 

4936
02:38:28,298 --> 02:38:31,534
HER PLACE OF WORK WHICH IS  UM, 

4937
02:38:31,534 --> 02:38:32,535
A CLASSROOM SETTING. 

4938
02:38:32,535 --> 02:38:35,672
ANDMISTOOK ONE OF THEM FOR A 

4939
02:38:35,672 --> 02:38:36,673
STUDENT. 

4940
02:38:36,673 --> 02:38:37,240
SO THE INVASIVENESS OFTHIS 

4941
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:38,408
WHOLE PROCESS IS JUST 

4942
02:38:38,408 --> 02:38:40,744
COMPLETELY, UM, JARRING TO ANY 

4943
02:38:40,744 --> 02:38:42,312
OF US LISTENING TO THIS 

4944
02:38:42,312 --> 02:38:43,013
TESTIMONY. 

4945
02:38:43,013 --> 02:38:43,980
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINEWHAT IT'S 

4946
02:38:43,980 --> 02:38:44,347
LIKE FOR HER. 

4947
02:38:44,347 --> 02:38:46,283
I THINKIT'S IMPORTANT THAT 

4948
02:38:46,283 --> 02:38:47,017
SHE'S TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE 

4949
02:38:47,017 --> 02:38:47,617
FACT THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO 

4950
02:38:47,617 --> 02:38:51,021
BE IN THE POSITION THAT SHE'S 

4951
02:38:51,021 --> 02:38:51,288
IN NOW. 

4952
02:38:51,288 --> 02:38:53,089
SHEWAS SIMPLY TRYING TO INFORM 

4953
02:38:53,089 --> 02:38:54,257
THOSE WHO WOULD BE MAKING A 

4954
02:38:54,257 --> 02:38:54,958
DECISION ABOUT A SUPREME COURT 

4955
02:38:54,958 --> 02:38:57,327
NOMINEE. 

4956
02:38:57,327 --> 02:38:58,462
>> SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT RACHEL 

4957
02:38:58,462 --> 02:39:00,998
MITCHELL AND HOW IT APPEARS AT 

4958
02:39:00,998 --> 02:39:02,599
LEAST TO THOSE OF US WATCHING 

4959
02:39:02,599 --> 02:39:04,134
THAT SHE'S CROSS EXAMINING A 

4960
02:39:04,134 --> 02:39:06,203
VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

4961
02:39:06,203 --> 02:39:07,004
HOWDO WE -- [INAUDIBLE] 

4962
02:39:07,004 --> 02:39:09,706
PERFORMANCE SO FAR?  

4963
02:39:09,706 --> 02:39:10,607
I MEAN IT STRIKES ME AS 

4964
02:39:10,607 --> 02:39:11,141
INITIALLY HIS OPENING 

4965
02:39:11,141 --> 02:39:13,977
STATEMENTS SEEMED TO ATTACK HER 

4966
02:39:13,977 --> 02:39:14,410
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. 

4967
02:39:14,410 --> 02:39:18,081
BUT ON THE OTHERHAND I 

4968
02:39:18,081 --> 02:39:18,715
SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE HE ACTUALLY 

4969
02:39:18,715 --> 02:39:20,083
DOESN'T WANT TO BE THERE AND 

4970
02:39:20,083 --> 02:39:21,184
GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS 

4971
02:39:21,184 --> 02:39:21,751
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT MITCH 

4972
02:39:21,751 --> 02:39:25,923
McCONNELL WANTS. 

4973
02:39:25,923 --> 02:39:26,556
>> THIS IS NOT A SITUATION THAT 

4974
02:39:26,556 --> 02:39:27,157
ANY OF THESE REPUBLICANS WANT 

4975
02:39:27,157 --> 02:39:31,194
TO BE IN AT ALL FOR STARTERS. 

4976
02:39:31,194 --> 02:39:32,395
HEALSO WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH 

4977
02:39:32,395 --> 02:39:33,263
IN HIS OPENING STATEMENTS THAT 

4978
02:39:33,263 --> 02:39:33,730
THEY HAVE WANTED THIS 

4979
02:39:33,730 --> 02:39:35,933
INORMATION  TO COME TO THE 

4980
02:39:35,933 --> 02:39:39,036
COMMITTEE EARLIER SO THEY COULD 

4981
02:39:39,036 --> 02:39:41,238
-- HE'S ARGUING COULD PROPERLY 

4982
02:39:41,238 --> 02:39:43,006
INVESTIGATE IT. 

4983
02:39:43,006 --> 02:39:43,640
OF COURSEREPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN 

4984
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:47,076
LAW MEANTING THE PROCESS, THE 

4985
02:39:47,076 --> 02:39:50,180
WAY IN WHICH FINESTEIN WAITED 

4986
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:52,415
TO BRING IT TO THE FBI OF 

4987
02:39:52,415 --> 02:39:58,355
COURSE ARGUING SHE WANTED TO 

4988
02:39:58,355 --> 02:40:00,724
PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF 

4989
02:40:00,724 --> 02:40:00,924
FORD. 

4990
02:40:00,924 --> 02:40:02,225
BUT SOTHERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS 

4991
02:40:02,225 --> 02:40:04,461
OVER ALL OF THIS ABOUT THE 

4992
02:40:04,461 --> 02:40:06,330
POLITICAL NATURE OF IT. 

4993
02:40:06,330 --> 02:40:07,030
I THINK IT ISIMPORTANT TO SEE 

4994
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:10,133
HOW BOTH SIDES ARE INVOLVED IN 

4995
02:40:10,133 --> 02:40:11,034
POLITICAL BACK AND FORTH HERE 

4996
02:40:11,034 --> 02:40:12,469
AND LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN 

4997
02:40:12,469 --> 02:40:12,836
POINTS TO MAKE. 

4998
02:40:12,836 --> 02:40:14,604
>> SO THE SENATORS ARE STARTING 

4999
02:40:14,604 --> 02:40:16,106
TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK TO THE 

5000
02:40:16,106 --> 02:40:17,641
BRIEFING ROOM. 

5001
02:40:17,641 --> 02:40:19,009
BEFORE WE GOBACK TO THIS 

5002
02:40:19,009 --> 02:40:20,110
HEARING I WANT TO PLAY SLOT 

5003
02:40:20,110 --> 02:40:22,913
NUMBER 7.  THEREPUBLICANS HAVE 

5004
02:40:22,913 --> 02:40:26,216
PUT OUT A THEORY I'VE STARTED 

5005
02:40:26,216 --> 02:40:26,917
TO CALL IT THE MISTAKEN 

5006
02:40:26,917 --> 02:40:29,653
IDENTITY THEORY WHERE THEY'RE 

5007
02:40:29,653 --> 02:40:30,921
SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS HER 

5008
02:40:30,921 --> 02:40:33,624
MEMORY SHE WAS ASSAULTED THAT 

5009
02:40:33,624 --> 02:40:34,925
NIGHT BUT IT WASN'T BRETT 

5010
02:40:34,925 --> 02:40:35,458
KAVANAUGH OR MARK JUDGE. 

5011
02:40:35,458 --> 02:40:37,326
THEY ASKED HER WHATDEGREE OF 

5012
02:40:37,326 --> 02:40:37,894
CERTAINTY DOES SHE BELIEVE 

5013
02:40:37,894 --> 02:40:41,131
BRETT KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED HER 

5014
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:41,564
AND SHE SAYS 100%. 

5015
02:40:41,564 --> 02:40:42,699
HERE'S WHAT ELSE SHE SAYS ABOUT 

5016
02:40:42,699 --> 02:40:46,903
HOW SHE FELT THAT NIGHT.     

5017
02:40:46,903 --> 02:40:48,205
. 

5018
02:40:48,205 --> 02:40:48,872
>> WHAT IS THE STRONGORS MEMORY 

5019
02:40:48,872 --> 02:40:51,741
YOU HAVE  STRONGEST MEMORY OF 

5020
02:40:51,741 --> 02:40:55,946
THE INCIDENT, SOMETHING THAT 

5021
02:40:55,946 --> 02:40:56,646
YOU CAN NOT FORGET? 

5022
02:40:56,646 --> 02:41:02,352
TAKEWHATEVER TIME YOU NEED.    

5023
02:41:02,352 --> 02:41:06,123

5024
02:41:06,123 --> 02:41:06,923
>> -- IS THE LAUGHTER -- THE

02:41:06,923 --> 02:41:09,693
[INAUDIBLE]    

5026
02:41:09,693 --> 02:41:13,430
AND THEIR HAVING FUN  AT MY

LAUGHTER. 

5031
02:41:20,103 --> 02:41:22,906
>> NO. 

5032
02:41:22,906 --> 02:41:23,439
>> NEVER FORGOTTEN THEM 

5033
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:24,341
LAUGHING AT YOU. 

5034
02:41:24,341 --> 02:41:25,141

02:41:25,141 --> 02:41:25,809
OTHER.     

5036
02:41:25,809 --> 02:41:27,377

5037
02:41:27,377 --> 02:41:29,479
>> AND YOU WERE THE OBJECT OF 

5038
02:41:29,479 --> 02:41:31,014
THE LAUGHTER?   

5039
02:41:31,014 --> 02:41:32,048
. 

5040
02:41:32,048 --> 02:41:33,650
>> I WAS, YOU KNOW, UNDERNEATH 

5041
02:41:33,650 --> 02:41:34,584
ONE OF THEM WHILE THE 2 

5042
02:41:34,584 --> 02:41:36,119
LAUGHED.   

5043
02:41:36,119 --> 02:41:37,487
2 FRIENDS HAVING A REALLY GOOD 

5044
02:41:37,487 --> 02:41:42,926
TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER.     

5045
02:41:42,926 --> 02:41:43,994
. 

5046
02:41:43,994 --> 02:41:44,761
>> YEAH, I'VE GOT TO SAY 

5047
02:41:44,761 --> 02:41:49,299
WATCHING HER  SAY THOSE WORDS  

5048
02:41:49,299 --> 02:41:51,267
IT -- THEY -- YOU COULD SEE 

5049
02:41:51,267 --> 02:41:52,301
THAT SHE WAS SORT OF RELIVING 

5050
02:41:52,301 --> 02:41:54,704
THAT MOMENT. 

5051
02:41:54,704 --> 02:41:54,937
>>YEAH. 

5052
02:41:54,937 --> 02:41:55,438
>> IN THE WAY THAT SHE 

5053
02:41:55,438 --> 02:41:56,472
DESCRIBED IT. 

5054
02:41:56,472 --> 02:41:58,909
AND I SORT OF THINK THATTHAT 

5055
02:41:58,909 --> 02:42:00,477
MOMENT THERE IS GOING TO 

5056
02:42:00,477 --> 02:42:02,678
CRYSTALLIZE THE ENTIRE THING. 

5057
02:42:02,678 --> 02:42:03,279
IN FACT, I THINK I HEARD YOU 

5058
02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:06,650
SAY WHEN SHE SAID THAT IT'S 

5059
02:42:06,650 --> 02:42:07,250
ALMOST SHE'S THIS OBJECT NOT 

5060
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:10,419
EVEN THERE, SHE'S A PIECE OF 

5061
02:42:10,419 --> 02:42:11,020
MEAT WHILE THEY'RE HAVING A 

5062
02:42:11,020 --> 02:42:13,023
GOOD TIME AND SHE'S LYING 

5063
02:42:13,023 --> 02:42:14,157
UNDERNEATH ONE OF THEM. 

5064
02:42:14,157 --> 02:42:15,926
>> I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE 

5065
02:42:15,926 --> 02:42:17,427
MAJOR HEADLINES COMING OUT OF 

5066
02:42:17,427 --> 02:42:18,929
THIS. 

5067
02:42:18,929 --> 02:42:19,529
I THINK IT'S ALSOIMPORTANT TO 

5068
02:42:19,529 --> 02:42:22,933
TALK ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH SHE 

5069
02:42:22,933 --> 02:42:23,500
WAS ESTABLISHING WHAT THAT 

5070
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:25,502
PARTY WAS LIKE. 

5071
02:42:25,502 --> 02:42:27,571
>> NOT A REAL PARTY SHE SAYS. 

5072
02:42:27,571 --> 02:42:30,206
>> IT WASN'T AS IF -- AND THE 

5073
02:42:30,206 --> 02:42:32,209
SCENE SHE'S SETTING THAT IT 

5074
02:42:32,209 --> 02:42:33,176
WASN'T THIS BIG PARTY, THAT 

5075
02:42:33,176 --> 02:42:35,679
SOMEONE COULD HAVE BUMPED INTO 

5076
02:42:35,679 --> 02:42:37,247
HER AND, UM, YOU KNOW, IT COULD 

5077
02:42:37,247 --> 02:42:38,681
HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE. 

5078
02:42:38,681 --> 02:42:39,315
SHEKNEW THESE PEOPLE, GREW UP 

5079
02:42:39,315 --> 02:42:40,784
WITH THEM. 

5080
02:42:40,784 --> 02:42:42,919
THIS IS A COMMUNITY INWHICH ALL 

5081
02:42:42,919 --> 02:42:44,186
OF THESE SCHOOLS ARE MINGLING 

5082
02:42:44,186 --> 02:42:46,957
WITH EACH OTHER AND PEOPLE KIND 

5083
02:42:46,957 --> 02:42:47,991
OF KNOW EACH OTHER. 

5084
02:42:47,991 --> 02:42:49,359
THOSE ARE WHAT SHE WAS TRYING 

5085
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:50,493
TO ESTABLISH ABOUT THE SCENE 

5086
02:42:50,493 --> 02:42:53,997
AND ONLY YOU KNOW, MAYBE 6 OR 

5087
02:42:53,997 --> 02:42:55,065
SO PEOPLE THERE IN HER 

5088
02:42:55,065 --> 02:42:56,766
RECOLLECTION A THAT SHE KNEW IT 

5089
02:42:56,766 --> 02:42:59,035
WAS MARK JUDGE AND KNEW THAT 

5090
02:42:59,035 --> 02:43:01,171
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS THERE AND 

5091
02:43:01,171 --> 02:43:01,805
DID THIS TO HER AND SHE SAID A 

5092
02:43:01,805 --> 02:43:04,507
HUNDRED PERCENT. 

5093
02:43:04,507 --> 02:43:07,243
>> I LIKE HOW SHE EXPLAINED HOW 

5094
02:43:07,243 --> 02:43:07,777
MEMORY WORKS [INAUDIBLE] 

5095
02:43:07,777 --> 02:43:10,347
ONE OF 2 THINGS IF YOU'VE 

5096
02:43:10,347 --> 02:43:10,914
EXPERIENCED TRAUMAS, AN 

5097
02:43:10,914 --> 02:43:12,982
INCIDENT THAT CHANGED YOUR 

5098
02:43:12,982 --> 02:43:14,751
LIFE, YOU WOULD EITHER REMEMBER 

5099
02:43:14,751 --> 02:43:15,452
EVERY SINGLE MINOR DETAIL. 

5100
02:43:15,452 --> 02:43:17,988
>> UM-HUM. 

5101
02:43:17,988 --> 02:43:20,257
>> OR BLOCK IT OUT BECAUSE IT 

5102
02:43:20,257 --> 02:43:20,690
WAS SO TRAUMATIC. 

5103
02:43:20,690 --> 02:43:23,059
SHE REALLYEXPLAINED IT DOESN'T 

5104
02:43:23,059 --> 02:43:23,426
WORK LIKE THAT. 

5105
02:43:23,426 --> 02:43:25,395
YOU FOCUS IN ON CERTAINDETAILS 

5106
02:43:25,395 --> 02:43:27,564
AND NEVER FORGET THEM. 

5107
02:43:27,564 --> 02:43:28,498
AND THEN SOME OF THE PER RIVER 

5108
02:43:28,498 --> 02:43:29,132
DETAILS YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER. 

5109
02:43:29,132 --> 02:43:29,966
>> YES. 

5110
02:43:29,966 --> 02:43:32,335
>> SO YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER 

5111
02:43:32,335 --> 02:43:33,270
THAT 4TH PERSON THAT WAS IN THE 

5112
02:43:33,270 --> 02:43:33,870
KITCHEN AT THE TIME WHEN YOU 

5113
02:43:33,870 --> 02:43:35,105
WALKED IN. 

5114
02:43:35,105 --> 02:43:38,341
>> RIGHT, WHERE THE DOOR WAS. 

5115
02:43:38,341 --> 02:43:38,774
>> RIGHT, EXACTLY. 

5116
02:43:38,774 --> 02:43:39,308
BUT THATDOESN'T MEAN YOUR 

5117
02:43:39,308 --> 02:43:40,944
MEMORY IS UNRELIABLE. 

5118
02:43:40,944 --> 02:43:43,446
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. 

5119
02:43:43,446 --> 02:43:46,583
>> IT IS INTERESTING THAT SHE'S 

5120
02:43:46,583 --> 02:43:49,519
USING HER SCIENCE BACKGROUND TO 

5121
02:43:49,519 --> 02:43:51,488
SORT OF PROP UP OR BUTTRESS HER 

5122
02:43:51,488 --> 02:43:53,189
ALLEGATION. 

5123
02:43:53,189 --> 02:43:55,058
AGAIN, IT GOES BACKTO WHAT WE 

5124
02:43:55,058 --> 02:43:58,728
WERE SAYING, IT DOES FEEL THAT 

5125
02:43:58,728 --> 02:43:59,328
THIS WAS A MIS -- THIS WAS A 

5126
02:43:59,328 --> 02:44:01,798
MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 

5127
02:44:01,798 --> 02:44:02,131
REPUBLICANS. 

5128
02:44:02,131 --> 02:44:02,965
INSTEAD OF HAVINGRACHEL 

5129
02:44:02,965 --> 02:44:04,234
MITCHELL UP THIS CROSS 

5130
02:44:04,234 --> 02:44:06,803
EXAMINING HER THEY COULD HAVE 

5131
02:44:06,803 --> 02:44:08,338
ASKED THE QUESTIONS TO THEIR 

5132
02:44:08,338 --> 02:44:08,571
LIKING. 

5133
02:44:08,571 --> 02:44:09,672
AND THEY DID NOT DOTHAT I FEEL 

5134
02:44:09,672 --> 02:44:11,207
IS GOING TO HURT THEM. 

5135
02:44:11,207 --> 02:44:12,942
>>  AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO 

5136
02:44:12,942 --> 02:44:13,542
SHOW SOME SYMPATHY TO HER AS 

5137
02:44:13,542 --> 02:44:14,144
WELL. 

5138
02:44:14,144 --> 02:44:14,444
>>  YES. 

5139
02:44:14,444 --> 02:44:17,180
>>YEAH. 

5140
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:20,116
>>  AND TO NEGATE THE OPTICS OF

5141
02:44:20,116 --> 02:44:22,152
THE SITUATION OR TRY TO TEMPER 

5142
02:44:22,152 --> 02:44:23,687
THEM BY SHOWING SOME AMOUNT OF 

5143
02:44:23,687 --> 02:44:24,987
SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR 

5144
02:44:24,987 --> 02:44:26,857
HER ACCOUNTING. 

5145
02:44:26,857 --> 02:44:28,625
>> I THINK RACHEL -- I GO BACK 

5146
02:44:28,625 --> 02:44:28,925
AND FORTH. 

5147
02:44:28,925 --> 02:44:30,427
AS I'M WATCHING ITHINK SHE'S 

5148
02:44:30,427 --> 02:44:32,128
VERY GOOD. 

5149
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:32,862
>>  SHE IS, YEAH, SHE'S DOING A 

5150
02:44:32,862 --> 02:44:34,564
GOOD JOB. 

5151
02:44:34,564 --> 02:44:35,398
>>  SHE'S A VICTIM'S ADVOCATE. 

5152
02:44:35,398 --> 02:44:38,401
>> RIGHT. 

5153
02:44:38,401 --> 02:44:41,137
>> I THINK SHE DID TRY TO MAKE, 

5154
02:44:41,137 --> 02:44:42,805
UM AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE. 

5155
02:44:42,805 --> 02:44:45,708
I THINK SHE DID A GOOD JOB. 

5156
02:44:45,708 --> 02:44:48,678
HAVING HER  DO -- I SUPPOSE 

5157
02:44:48,678 --> 02:44:49,312
QUESTIONS FOR THE REPUBLICANS, 

5158
02:44:49,312 --> 02:44:50,980
WHAT HAPPENS  ON THE -- FOR THE 

5159
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:52,415
DEMOCRATS IS THAT  THEY RUN THE 

5160
02:44:52,415 --> 02:44:56,987
RISK  OF LOOKING LIKE THEY ARE  

5161
02:44:56,987 --> 02:44:57,854
POLITICIZING HER. 

5162
02:44:57,854 --> 02:44:59,823
>>  UM-HUM. 

5163
02:44:59,823 --> 02:45:03,293
>> BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE 

5164
02:45:03,293 --> 02:45:04,694
ONES ASKING THESE REALLY 

5165
02:45:04,694 --> 02:45:06,763
INTIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT 

5166
02:45:06,763 --> 02:45:07,263
WAS THE -- [INAUDIBLE] 

5167
02:45:07,263 --> 02:45:08,764
HAD IT TOGETHER AND ALMOST 

5168
02:45:08,764 --> 02:45:10,567
GOING TO CRY. 

5169
02:45:10,567 --> 02:45:12,802
SO IT'S THE DEMOCRATS THATARE 

5170
02:45:12,802 --> 02:45:14,004
DOING THAT. 

5171
02:45:14,004 --> 02:45:14,571
THEY HAVE TO BEVERY CAREFUL 

5172
02:45:14,571 --> 02:45:15,739
GOING FORWARD. 

5173
02:45:15,739 --> 02:45:17,273
>>  THEY LOOK AS IF THEY 

5174
02:45:17,273 --> 02:45:18,909
ALREADY BELIEVE EVERYTHING SHE 

5175
02:45:18,909 --> 02:45:20,243
HAS TO SAY, THAT WHEN JUDGE 

5176
02:45:20,243 --> 02:45:20,877
KAVANAUGH MAKES HIS APPEARANCE 

5177
02:45:20,877 --> 02:45:24,980
THEY IMMEDIATELY ATTACK HIM AS 

5178
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:25,982
IF HE'S ACTUALLY DONE IT AND 

5179
02:45:25,982 --> 02:45:26,482
IT'S NOT A FACT FINDING 

5180
02:45:26,482 --> 02:45:28,318
OPPORTUNITY OR THEM. 

5181
02:45:28,318 --> 02:45:29,652
>>  RIGHT. 

5182
02:45:29,652 --> 02:45:32,055
>> AND THAT SORT OF THING, 

5183
02:45:32,055 --> 02:45:32,588
REMEMBER THAT A COUPLE OF 

5184
02:45:32,588 --> 02:45:34,190
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

5185
02:45:34,190 --> 02:45:35,225
COMMITTEE ON THE DEMOCRATIC 

5186
02:45:35,225 --> 02:45:38,428
SIDE ARE POSSIBLE 2020 

5187
02:45:38,428 --> 02:45:38,728
CONTENDERS. 

5188
02:45:38,728 --> 02:45:39,262
THIS IS A PUBLIC HEARING. 

5189
02:45:39,262 --> 02:45:42,632
WE'VESEEN IN THIS SETTING 

5190
02:45:42,632 --> 02:45:43,233
BEFORE ESPECIALLY DURING THE 

5191
02:45:43,233 --> 02:45:44,167
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARINGS 

5192
02:45:44,167 --> 02:45:46,870
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE , YOU 

5193
02:45:46,870 --> 02:45:47,403
KNOW, USE THESE KINDS OF 

5194
02:45:47,403 --> 02:45:47,670
SETTINGS. 

5195
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:48,972
>> RIGHT. 

5196
02:45:48,972 --> 02:45:49,672
>> TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN 

5197
02:45:49,672 --> 02:45:54,310
PROFILES.      

5198
02:45:54,310 --> 02:45:54,443
. 

5199
02:45:54,443 --> 02:45:55,144
>> I THINK IT WAS -- WHO 

5200
02:45:55,144 --> 02:45:56,646
BROUGHT HER HER COFFEE. 

5201
02:45:56,646 --> 02:45:58,915
AND WE REMEMBERDURING THE 

5202
02:45:58,915 --> 02:46:02,452
EARLIER TESTIMONY THERE WAS -- 

5203
02:46:02,452 --> 02:46:03,085
THERE WERE TIMES WHERE IT 

5204
02:46:03,085 --> 02:46:05,088
SEEMED LIKE SENATOR BOOKER WAS 

5205
02:46:05,088 --> 02:46:06,423
REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 

5206
02:46:06,423 --> 02:46:07,057
SPOTLIGHT, LET'S PUT IT THAT 

5207
02:46:07,057 --> 02:46:08,191
WAY. 

5208
02:46:08,191 --> 02:46:10,126
>> THAT SHOT WE WERE JUST 

5209
02:46:10,126 --> 02:46:11,861
SHOWING YOU, THAT IS JUDGE 

5210
02:46:11,861 --> 02:46:13,830
KAVANAUGH'S HOME. 

5211
02:46:13,830 --> 02:46:14,497
HE'S SOON SETTO DEPART FOR 

5212
02:46:14,497 --> 02:46:14,998
CAPITOL HILL. 

5213
02:46:14,998 --> 02:46:16,333
THEY'RE CLEARLY -- HE DID NOT 

5214
02:46:16,333 --> 02:46:17,700
WANT TO BE IN THE ROOM WITH 

5215
02:46:17,700 --> 02:46:18,735

02:51:26,943 --> 02:51:27,476
>> UM, I DON'T REMEMBER. 

5396
02:51:27,476 --> 02:51:30,046
IREMEMBER SUMMARIZING FOR HER 

5397
02:51:30,046 --> 02:51:30,413
WHAT THEY SAID. 

5398
02:51:30,413 --> 02:51:32,348
SO I'M NOTQUITE SURE IF I 

5399
02:51:32,348 --> 02:51:33,015
ACTUALLY GAVE HER THE RECORD.   

5400
02:51:33,015 --> 02:51:33,416
. 

5401
02:51:33,416 --> 02:51:34,984
>> OKAY.    

5402
02:51:34,984 --> 02:51:41,190
UM,     SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT 

5403
02:51:41,190 --> 02:51:43,158
THE REPORTER DID NOT SEE THESE 

5404
02:51:43,158 --> 02:51:43,392
NOTES. 

5405
02:51:43,392 --> 02:51:45,094
? 

5406
02:51:45,094 --> 02:51:46,762
>> UM, I DON'T KNOW IF SHE -- I 

5407
02:51:46,762 --> 02:51:49,232
CAN'T RECALL WHETHER SHE SAW 

5408
02:51:49,232 --> 02:51:50,733
THEM INDIRECTLY OR IF I JUST 

5409
02:51:50,733 --> 02:51:54,904
TOLD HER WHAT THEY SAID. 

5410
02:51:54,904 --> 02:51:55,204
>> OKAY. 

5411
02:51:55,204 --> 02:51:56,638
HAVE YOU SHOWN THEM TOANYONE 

5412
02:51:56,638 --> 02:51:57,707
ELSE BESIDES YOU'RE COUNSEL. 

5413
02:51:57,707 --> 02:52:00,543
>>  JUST THE COUNSEL. 

5414
02:52:00,543 --> 02:52:01,544
>> OKAY. 

5415
02:52:01,544 --> 02:52:02,445
UM, WOULD IT BE FAIRTO SAY THAT 

5416
02:52:02,445 --> 02:52:03,479
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NAME IS NOT 

5417
02:52:03,479 --> 02:52:05,882
LISTED IN THOSE NOTES? 

5418
02:52:05,882 --> 02:52:06,682
>> HIS NAME IS NOT LISTED IN 

5419
02:52:06,682 --> 02:52:08,451
THOSE NOTES. 

5420
02:52:08,451 --> 02:52:10,720
>> WOULD IT ALSO BE FAIR TO SAY 

5421
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:11,587
THAT THE THERAPIST'S NOTES WE 

5422
02:52:11,587 --> 02:52:13,723
WERE TALKING ABOUT SAY THERE 

5423
02:52:13,723 --> 02:52:16,259
WERE 4 BOYS IN THE ROOM? 

5424
02:52:16,259 --> 02:52:19,428
>> UM, IT DESCRIBES THE SEXUAL 

5425
02:52:19,428 --> 02:52:22,165
ASSAULT, AND IT SAYS  

5426
02:52:22,165 --> 02:52:23,633
ERRONEOUSLY BY 4 BOYS SO THE 

5427
02:52:23,633 --> 02:52:24,267
THERAPIST GOT THE CONTENT OF IT 

5428
02:52:24,267 --> 02:52:26,369
WRONG. 

5429
02:52:26,369 --> 02:52:26,969
>> AND YOU CONNECTED THAT TO 

5430
02:52:26,969 --> 02:52:30,673
THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTER, 

5431
02:52:30,673 --> 02:52:30,940
CORRECT? 

5432
02:52:30,940 --> 02:52:32,341
>> CORRECT. 

5433
02:52:32,341 --> 02:52:35,378
>> SENATOR WHITEHOUSE. 

5434
02:52:35,378 --> 02:52:36,678
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 

5435
02:52:36,678 --> 02:52:37,980
THANKYOU DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY

FORD. 

5437
02:52:38,180 --> 02:52:38,780
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF 

5438
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:41,584
YOU TODAY. 

5439
02:52:41,584 --> 02:52:43,752
FROM A PROSECUTOR'S VIEWONE OF 

5440
02:52:43,752 --> 02:52:44,620
THE HARDEST THINGS THAT  WE 

5441
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:48,091
HAVE TO DO  IS TO  SPEAK TO 

5442
02:52:48,091 --> 02:52:49,592
SOMEBODY WHO HAS COME FORWARD  

5443
02:52:49,592 --> 02:52:51,294
WITH AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL 

5444
02:52:51,294 --> 02:52:53,196
ASSAULT AND LET THEM KNOW THAT  

5445
02:52:53,196 --> 02:52:54,697
WE CAN'T PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE  

5446
02:52:54,697 --> 02:52:57,667
TO GO FORWARD TO TRIAL.      

5447
02:52:57,667 --> 02:52:59,168
IT'S A HARD DAY FOR THE 

5448
02:52:59,168 --> 02:53:00,503
PROSECUTOR TO DO THAT.   

5449
02:53:00,503 --> 02:53:00,636
. 

5450
02:53:00,636 --> 02:53:04,273
>> UM-HUM. 

5451
02:53:04,273 --> 02:53:07,176
>> AND SO BOTH BECAUSE  MAKING  

5452
02:53:07,176 --> 02:53:09,979
[INAUDIBLE] 

5453
02:53:09,979 --> 02:53:11,313
INVESTIGATIVE EFFORT IS SUCH AN 

5454
02:53:11,313 --> 02:53:13,216
IMPORTANT CONSOLATION TO THE 

5455
02:53:13,216 --> 02:53:16,752
VICTIM IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND 

5456
02:53:16,752 --> 02:53:18,687
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT YOU'RE OWE 

5457
02:53:18,687 --> 02:53:19,655
BRIDGED TO DO PROFESSIONALLY 

5458
02:53:19,655 --> 02:53:20,122
SINCERE AND THOROUGH 

5459
02:53:20,122 --> 02:53:24,861
INVESTIGATION    IS CRITICAL TO 

5460
02:53:24,861 --> 02:53:25,494
THESE CLAIMS IN A PROSECUTOR'S 

5461
02:53:25,494 --> 02:53:27,763
WORLD.     

5462
02:53:27,763 --> 02:53:29,298
IT MAY BE THE MOST BASIC THING 

5463
02:53:29,298 --> 02:53:31,000
THAT WE OWE A VICTIM  OR A 

5464
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,803
WITNESS COMING FORWARD  IS TO 

5465
02:53:33,803 --> 02:53:35,004
MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE THEM A 

5466
02:53:35,004 --> 02:53:37,006
FULL  THOROUGH AND SINCERE 

5467
02:53:37,006 --> 02:53:39,509
INVESTIGATION.     

5468
02:53:39,509 --> 02:53:41,577
YOU HAVE MET ALL OF THE  

5469
02:53:41,577 --> 02:53:44,347
STANDARDS OF WHAT I MIGHT CALL 

5470
02:53:44,347 --> 02:53:44,947
PRELIMINARY CREDIBILITY WITH 

5471
02:53:44,947 --> 02:53:48,251

SOMETHING PROSECUTORS LOOK FOR. 

5475
02:53:56,225 --> 02:53:58,126
YOUR RECOLLECTIONS ARE 

5476
02:53:58,126 --> 02:54:00,963
CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN FACTS.    

5477
02:54:00,963 --> 02:54:04,667
YOU MADE PRIOR CONSISTENT 

5478
02:54:04,667 --> 02:54:05,868
STATEMENTS, SOMETHING ELSE 

5479
02:54:05,868 --> 02:54:08,170
PROSECUTORS AND LAWYERS LOOK 

5480
02:54:08,170 --> 02:54:08,370
FOR. 

5481
02:54:08,370 --> 02:54:10,606

BY A PROSECUTOR.      

5487
02:54:21,651 --> 02:54:24,920
SO YOU'VE MET  ANY CONDITION , 

5488
02:54:24,920 --> 02:54:28,758
ANY PROSECUTOR COULD EXPECT TO 

5489
02:54:28,758 --> 02:54:29,525
GO FORWARD, AND YET, THERE HAS 

5490
02:54:29,525 --> 02:54:32,728
BEEN NO  SINCERE  OR THOROUGH  

5491
02:54:32,728 --> 02:54:35,798
INVESTIGATION  OF YOUR CLAIMS.  

5492

>> AND ARE YOU AWARE THAT WHEN 

5497
02:54:50,379 --> 02:54:54,150
THE FBI BEGINS INVESTIGATING 

5498
02:54:54,150 --> 02:54:54,717
THEY MIGHT FIND CORROBORATE 

5499
02:54:54,717 --> 02:54:55,384
EVIDENCE AND MIGHT FIND EX CULL 

5500
02:54:55,384 --> 02:54:56,919
TORE EVIDENCE. 

5501
02:54:56,919 --> 02:54:58,220

02:54:58,220 --> 02:55:00,122
TORE EVIDENCE IS. 

5503
02:55:00,122 --> 02:55:02,391

RECOLLECTION AND VERSION OF

02:55:05,027 --> 02:55:06,062
EVENTS HELPFUL TO THE ACCUSED. 

5506
02:55:06,062 --> 02:55:06,462

5507
02:55:06,462 --> 02:55:07,063

5508
02:55:07,063 --> 02:55:08,431

>> AND YOU'RE STILL    NOT JUST 

5510
02:55:11,032 --> 02:55:14,403
WILLING, BUT  INSISTENT THAT 

5511
02:55:14,403 --> 02:55:16,806
THE FBI SHOULD INVESTIGATE YOUR 

5512
02:55:16,806 --> 02:55:19,241
RECOLLECTION AND YOUR  CLAIM? 

5513
02:55:19,241 --> 02:55:21,477
>> YES, I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD   

5514
02:55:21,477 --> 02:55:23,412
-- I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL IN 

5515
02:55:23,412 --> 02:55:25,882
THAT IF THAT WAS THE CASE IN 

5516
02:55:25,882 --> 02:55:26,482
PROVIDING SOME OF THE DETAILS 

5517
02:55:26,482 --> 02:55:28,017
THAT MAY BE  PEOPLE ARE WANTING 

5518
02:55:28,017 --> 02:55:28,417
TO KNOW ABOUT.   

5519
02:55:28,417 --> 02:55:30,519
. 

5520
02:55:30,519 --> 02:55:33,522
>> AND AS WE KNOW THEY DIDN'T   

5521
02:55:33,522 --> 02:55:38,394
AND I SUBMIT  THAT NEVER  NEVER 

5522
02:55:38,394 --> 02:55:40,295
IN THE HISTORY OF BACKGROUND 

5523
02:55:40,295 --> 02:55:43,933
INVESTIGATIONS    HAS AN 

5524
02:55:43,933 --> 02:55:50,172
INVESTIGATION NOT  BEEN PURSUED 

5525
02:55:50,172 --> 02:55:51,073
WHEN NEW, CREDIBLE INFORMATION 

5526
02:55:51,073 --> 02:55:52,942
WAS BROUGHT FORWARD    ABOUT 

5527
02:55:52,942 --> 02:55:56,445
THE NOMINEE OR THE CANDIDATE.   

5528
02:55:56,445 --> 02:55:57,146
I DON'T THINK THIS HAS EVER 

5529
02:55:57,146 --> 02:56:02,250
HAPPENED  IN THE HISTORY OF FBI 

5530
02:56:02,250 --> 02:56:04,286
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. 

5531
02:56:04,286 --> 02:56:05,888
MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN PROVE ME 

5532
02:56:05,888 --> 02:56:06,956
WRONG BUT IT'S WILDLY UNUSUAL 

5533
02:56:06,956 --> 02:56:10,259
AND OUT OF CHARACTER.     

5534
02:56:10,259 --> 02:56:12,595
AND IN MY VIEW, IT IS A GRAVE 

5535
02:56:12,595 --> 02:56:14,930
DISSERVICE TO YOU AND I WANT TO 

5536
02:56:14,930 --> 02:56:16,731
TAKE THIS MOMENT TO APOLOGIZE 

5537
02:56:16,731 --> 02:56:17,633
TO YOU FOR THAT. 

5538
02:56:17,633 --> 02:56:19,101
ANDTO REPORT TO ANYBODY WHO 

5539
02:56:19,101 --> 02:56:19,702
MIGHT BE LISTENING THAT WHEN 

5540
02:56:19,702 --> 02:56:22,304
SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO COME 

5541
02:56:22,304 --> 02:56:22,905
FORWARD EVEN UNDER THOSE 

5542
02:56:22,905 --> 02:56:26,409
CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN HAVING BEEN 

5543
02:56:26,409 --> 02:56:26,976
NOT GIVEN THE MODICUM OF 

5544
02:56:26,976 --> 02:56:28,778
COURTESY AND SUPPORT OF A

PARTICULARLY PROUD IN DOING 

5548
02:56:32,514 --> 02:56:33,049
THAT.    

5549
02:56:33,049 --> 02:56:34,483
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 

5550
02:56:34,483 --> 02:56:37,486
DECISION   TO HAVE THIS BE, I 

5551
02:56:37,486 --> 02:56:38,053
THINK THE ONLY BACKGROUND

AS TO THE COMMITTEE'S

5569
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:19,328
THE VERY BARE MINIMUM IN A

WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE  

5643
02:59:31,593 --> 02:59:34,296

THEIR SEPTEMBER 16 ARTICLE THAT

03:00:20,209 --> 03:00:26,382
YOU DID SHOW THEM THERAPIST

NOTES. 

5665
03:00:26,615 --> 03:00:27,416
IS THAT INCORRECT? 

5666
03:00:27,416 --> 03:00:31,020
>>  I DON'T REMEMBER PHYSICALLY 

5667
03:00:31,020 --> 03:00:32,221
SHOWING HER A NOTE. 

5668
03:00:32,221 --> 03:00:33,556
PERHAPS MY COUNSEL DID. 

5669
03:00:33,556 --> 03:00:35,457
I DON'T REMEMBER PHYSICALLY

03:00:38,460 --> 03:00:38,660
NOTE. 

5672
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:41,764
I JUST DON'T REMEMBER. 

5673
03:00:41,764 --> 03:00:42,064
I'M SORRY. 

5674
03:00:42,064 --> 03:00:44,066
I HAVE RETRIEVED A PHYSICAL 

5675
03:00:44,066 --> 03:00:45,701
COPY OF THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS. 

5676
03:00:45,701 --> 03:00:49,038

03:00:49,038 --> 03:00:51,507
YOU ALSO ATTENDED INDIVIDUAL 

5678
03:00:51,507 --> 03:00:51,840
THERAPY. 

5679
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:55,511
DID YOU SHOW ANY OF THOSE NOTES 

5680
03:00:55,511 --> 03:00:57,379
TO THE REPORTER FROM THE 

5681
03:00:57,379 --> 03:00:57,780
WASHINGTON POST? 

5682
03:00:57,780 --> 03:01:01,350
>>  AGAIN, I DON'T REMEMBER IF 

5683
03:01:01,350 --> 03:01:03,118
I SHOWED HER SOMETHING THAT I 

5684
03:01:03,118 --> 03:01:05,721
SUMMARIZED OR IF I SPOKE ABOUT 

5685
03:01:05,721 --> 03:01:05,954
IT. 

5686
03:01:05,954 --> 03:01:08,524
OR IF SHE SAW IT IN MY 

5687
03:01:08,524 --> 03:01:08,924
COUNSEL'S OFFICE. 

5688
03:01:08,924 --> 03:01:10,259
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. 

5689
03:01:10,259 --> 03:01:12,661
I CERTAINLY SPOKE WITH HER 

5690
03:01:12,661 --> 03:01:14,797
ABOUT THE 2013 RECORD WITH THE 

5691
03:01:14,797 --> 03:01:15,264
INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST. 

5692
03:01:15,264 --> 03:01:17,866
>>  AND BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NAME 

5693
03:01:17,866 --> 03:01:19,768
IS NOT IN THOSE NOTES, IS THAT 

5694
03:01:19,768 --> 03:01:20,235
CORRECT? 

5695
03:01:20,235 --> 03:01:20,635
>>  CORRECT. 

5696
03:01:20,635 --> 03:01:23,238
>>  IN READING THE WASHINGTON 

5697
03:01:23,238 --> 03:01:25,040
POST ARTICLE, IT MENTIONS THAT 

5698
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:27,843
THIS INCIDENT THAT WE'RE HERE 

5699
03:01:27,843 --> 03:01:29,845
ABOUT CONTRIBUTED TO ANXIETY 

5700
03:01:29,845 --> 03:01:35,017
AND PTSD PROBLEMS WITH WHICH 

5701
03:01:35,017 --> 03:01:36,018
YOU HAVE STRUGGLED. 

5702
03:01:36,018 --> 03:01:36,819
THE WORD CONTRIBUTED, DOES THAT 

5703
03:01:36,819 --> 03:01:38,387
MEAN THERE ARE OTHER THINGS 

5704
03:01:38,387 --> 03:01:40,289
THAT HAVE HAPPENED THAT HAVE 

5705
03:01:40,289 --> 03:01:44,193
ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO ANXIETY AND 

5706
03:01:44,193 --> 03:01:44,393
PTSD? 

5707
03:01:44,393 --> 03:01:46,896
>>  I THINK THAT'S A GREAT 

5708
03:01:46,896 --> 03:01:47,162
QUESTION. 

5709
03:01:47,162 --> 03:01:54,470
I THINK THE EDOLOGY OF ANXIETY 

5710
03:01:54,470 --> 03:01:55,104
IS MULTIFACTORIAL. 

5711
03:01:55,104 --> 03:02:00,743
THAT WAS A CRITICAL RISK -- WE 

5712
03:02:00,743 --> 03:02:02,410
WOULD CALL IT A RISK FACTOR. 

5713
03:02:02,410 --> 03:02:09,585
IT WOULD BE A PREDICTER OF THE 

5714
03:02:09,585 --> 03:02:10,752
SYMPTOMS I HAVE. 

5715
03:02:10,752 --> 03:02:12,288
IT DOESN'T MEAN OTHER THINGS 

5716
03:02:12,288 --> 03:02:15,023
WOULD HAVE MADE IT WORSE. 

5717
03:02:15,023 --> 03:02:17,092
>>  ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT 

5718
03:02:17,092 --> 03:02:19,495
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ANXIETY 

5719
03:02:19,495 --> 03:02:20,629
AND PTSD THAT YOU SUFFERED? 

5720
03:02:20,629 --> 03:02:23,799
>>  WELL, I THINK THERE'S 

5721
03:02:23,799 --> 03:02:24,867
BIOLOGICAL PREDISPOSITIONS THAT 

5722
03:02:24,867 --> 03:02:27,369
EVERYONE IN HERE HAS FOR 

5723
03:02:27,369 --> 03:02:27,836
PARTICULAR DISORDERS. 

5724
03:02:27,836 --> 03:02:29,338
SO I CAN'T RULE OUT THAT I 

5725
03:02:29,338 --> 03:02:34,042
WOULD HAVE SOME BIOLOGICAL 

5726
03:02:34,042 --> 03:02:34,409
PREDISPOSITION. 

5727
03:02:34,409 --> 03:02:34,943
I'M AN ANXIOUS PERSON. 

5728
03:02:34,943 --> 03:02:36,678
>>  WHAT ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL? 

5729
03:02:36,678 --> 03:02:42,051
>>  ENVIRONMENTALLY, NOT THAT I 

5730
03:02:42,051 --> 03:02:42,517
CAN THINK OF. 

5731
03:02:42,517 --> 03:02:43,452
>>  OKAY. 

5732
03:02:43,452 --> 03:02:46,555
>>  CERTAINLY NOTHING AS 

5733
03:02:46,555 --> 03:02:47,122
STRIKING AS THAT EVENT. 

5734
03:02:47,122 --> 03:02:48,891
>>  OKAY. 

5735
03:02:48,891 --> 03:02:50,693
IN YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE 

5736
03:02:50,693 --> 03:02:52,194
WASHINGTON POST, YOU SAID THAT 

5737
03:02:52,194 --> 03:02:53,495
YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND EARLY IN 

5738
03:02:53,495 --> 03:02:55,497
YOUR MARRIAGE THAT YOU HAD BEEN 

5739
03:02:55,497 --> 03:02:58,100
A VICTIM OF, AND I QUOTE, 

5740
03:02:58,100 --> 03:02:58,500
PHYSICAL ABUSE. 

5741
03:02:58,500 --> 03:02:59,802
IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT 

5742
03:02:59,802 --> 03:03:02,171
BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED, YOU 

5743
03:03:02,171 --> 03:03:04,740
TOLD HIM YOU EXPERIENCED QUOTE, 

5744
03:03:04,740 --> 03:03:05,574
A SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

5745
03:03:05,574 --> 03:03:07,709
DO THESE TWO THINGS REFER TO 

5746
03:03:07,709 --> 03:03:08,142
THE SAME INCIDENT? 

5747
03:03:08,142 --> 03:03:09,244
>>  YES. 

5748
03:03:09,244 --> 03:03:12,748
>>  AND AT EITHER POINT ON 

5749
03:03:12,748 --> 03:03:16,185
THESE TWO TIMES, DID YOU USE 

5750
03:03:16,185 --> 03:03:16,485
ANY NAMES? 

5751
03:03:16,485 --> 03:03:17,819
>>  NO. 

5752
03:03:17,819 --> 03:03:20,689
>>  OKAY. 

5753
03:03:20,689 --> 03:03:24,393
MAY I ASK DR. FORD, HOW DID YOU 

5754
03:03:24,393 --> 03:03:24,826
GET TO WASHINGTON? 

5755
03:03:24,826 --> 03:03:25,827
>>  IN AN AIRPLANE. 

5756
03:03:25,827 --> 03:03:27,029
>>  OKAY. 

5757
03:03:27,029 --> 03:03:29,098
>>  I ASK THAT BECAUSE IT'S 

5758
03:03:29,098 --> 03:03:31,600
BEEN REPORTED BY THE PRESS THAT 

5759
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:33,001
YOU WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO AN 

5760
03:03:33,001 --> 03:03:34,203
INTERVIEW WITH THE COMMITTEE 

5761
03:03:34,203 --> 03:03:37,940
BECAUSE OF YOUR FEAR OF FLYING. 

5762
03:03:37,940 --> 03:03:38,374
IS THAT TRUE? 

5763
03:03:38,374 --> 03:03:41,744
>>  I WAS HOPING THEY WOULD 

5764
03:03:41,744 --> 03:03:44,947
COME TO ME, BUT I REALIZED THAT 

5765
03:03:44,947 --> 03:03:45,647
WAS AN UNREALISTIC REQUEST. 

5766
03:03:45,647 --> 03:03:47,583
>>  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 

5767
03:03:47,583 --> 03:03:48,850
QUICKER TRIP FOR ME. 

5768
03:03:48,850 --> 03:03:51,353
>>  YES. 

5769
03:03:51,353 --> 03:03:52,988
THAT WAS CERTAINLY WHAT I WAS 

5770
03:03:52,988 --> 03:03:56,892
HOPING, TO AVOID HAVING TO GET 

5771
03:03:56,892 --> 03:03:58,459
ON AN AIRPLANE. 

5772
03:03:58,459 --> 03:04:01,830
I EVENTUALLY WAS ABLE TO GET UP 

5773
03:04:01,830 --> 03:04:02,931
THE GUMPTION AND GET ON THE 

5774
03:04:02,931 --> 03:04:03,164
PLANE. 

5775
03:04:03,164 --> 03:04:06,902
>>  WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE 

5776
03:04:06,902 --> 03:04:09,872
MID ATLANTIC AREA BACK IN 

5777
03:04:09,872 --> 03:04:11,173
AUGUST, THE END OF JULY, 

5778
03:04:11,173 --> 03:04:12,707
AUGUST, HOW DID YOU GET HERE? 

5779
03:04:12,707 --> 03:04:14,442
>>  ALSO BY AIRPLANE. 

5780
03:04:14,442 --> 03:04:15,978
I COME HERE ONCE A YEAR DURING 

5781
03:04:15,978 --> 03:04:18,513
THE SUMMER TO VISIT MY FAMILY. 

5782
03:04:18,513 --> 03:04:19,581
I'M SORRY, NOT HERE. 

5783
03:04:19,581 --> 03:04:20,515
I GO TO DELAWARE. 

5784
03:04:20,515 --> 03:04:23,852
>>  OKAY. 

5785
03:04:23,852 --> 03:04:25,587
IN FACT, YOU FLY FAIRLY 

5786
03:04:25,587 --> 03:04:27,322
FREQUENTLY FOR YOUR HOBBIES AND 

5787
03:04:27,322 --> 03:04:29,224
YOU'VE HAD TO FLY FOR YOUR 

5788
03:04:29,224 --> 03:04:30,125
WORK, IS THAT TRUE? 

5789
03:04:30,125 --> 03:04:32,160
>>  CORRECT. 

5790
03:04:32,160 --> 03:04:32,527
UNFORTUNATELY. 

5791
03:04:32,527 --> 03:04:39,134
>>  YOU WERE A CONSULTING 

5792
03:04:39,134 --> 03:04:39,468
STATUSITION. 

5793
03:04:39,468 --> 03:04:41,503
>>  THE COMPANY I WORKED FOR IS 

5794
03:04:41,503 --> 03:04:42,604
BASED IN AUSTRALIA AND THEY 

5795
03:04:42,604 --> 03:04:44,773
HAVE AN OFFICE IN SAN 

5796
03:04:44,773 --> 03:04:45,273
FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. 

5797
03:04:45,273 --> 03:04:47,875
I DON'T THINK I'LL MAKE IT TO 

5798
03:04:47,875 --> 03:04:48,176
AUSTRALIA. 

5799
03:04:48,176 --> 03:04:51,480
>>  IT IS LONG. 

5800
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:54,917
I ALSO SAW THAT YOU LIST THE 

5801
03:04:54,917 --> 03:04:57,219
FOLLOWING INTERESTS OF TRAVEL 

5802
03:04:57,219 --> 03:05:10,833
AND YOU PUT HAWAII, CROWSLY 

5803
03:05:10,833 --> 03:05:11,133
COSTA RICA. 

5804
03:05:11,133 --> 03:05:11,966
AND OCEANOGRAPHY AND CULTURE. 

5805
03:05:11,966 --> 03:05:13,869
DID YOU TRAVEL BY AIR AS A PART 

5806
03:05:13,869 --> 03:05:14,403
OF THOSE INTERESTS? 

5807
03:05:14,403 --> 03:05:17,939
>>  CORRECT. 

5808
03:05:17,939 --> 03:05:19,374
EASIER FOR ME TO TRAVEL GOING 

5809
03:05:19,374 --> 03:05:23,078
THAT DIRECTION WHEN IT'S A 

5810
03:05:23,078 --> 03:05:23,345
VACATION. 

5811
03:05:23,345 --> 03:05:24,645
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5812
03:05:24,645 --> 03:05:27,983
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE DR. 

5813
03:05:27,983 --> 03:05:28,183
FORD. 

5814
03:05:28,183 --> 03:05:30,586
YOU KNOW, IN MY JOB AS A 

5815
03:05:30,586 --> 03:05:31,453
PROSECUTOR, WE INVESTIGATED 

5816
03:05:31,453 --> 03:05:32,287
REPORTS LIKE THIS. 

5817
03:05:32,287 --> 03:05:36,124
SO, IT GAVE ME A WINDOW ON THE 

5818
03:05:36,124 --> 03:05:37,593
TYPES OF CASES THAT HURT WOMEN 

5819
03:05:37,593 --> 03:05:39,294
AND HURT ALL OF US. 

5820
03:05:39,294 --> 03:05:40,896
AND I WOULD ALWAYS TELL THE 

5821
03:05:40,896 --> 03:05:41,930
WOMEN THAT CAME BEFORE US THAT 

5822
03:05:41,930 --> 03:05:44,099
THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL 

5823
03:05:44,099 --> 03:05:47,035
THEIR STORY BEFORE A JURY BOX 

5824
03:05:47,035 --> 03:05:47,870
OF STRANGERS. 

5825
03:05:47,870 --> 03:05:50,405
YOU'VE HAD TO TELL YOUR STORY 

5826
03:05:50,405 --> 03:05:51,439
BEFORE THE ENTIRE NATION. 

5827
03:05:51,439 --> 03:05:54,076
FOR SO MANY YEARS, PEOPLE SWEPT 

5828
03:05:54,076 --> 03:05:56,578
CASES LIKE YOURS UNDER THE RUG. 

5829
03:05:56,578 --> 03:05:59,014
THEY WOULD SAY, WHAT HAPPENS 

5830
03:05:59,014 --> 03:06:02,384
INSIDE A HOUSE DIDN'T BELONG IN 

5831
03:06:02,384 --> 03:06:03,084
THE COURTHOUSE. 

5832
03:06:03,084 --> 03:06:04,586
WELL, THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED. 

5833
03:06:04,586 --> 03:06:07,222
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 

5834
03:06:07,222 --> 03:06:09,825
COMING FORWARD TODAY AND FOR 

5835
03:06:09,825 --> 03:06:12,027
SHARING YOUR REPORT WITH US. 

5836
03:06:12,027 --> 03:06:14,229
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE 

5837
03:06:14,229 --> 03:06:16,131
TAKEN A POLYGRAPH TEST. 

5838
03:06:16,131 --> 03:06:18,133
DR. FORD, THAT FOUND THAT YOU 

5839
03:06:18,133 --> 03:06:19,334
WERE BEING TRUTHFUL WHEN YOU 

5840
03:06:19,334 --> 03:06:20,502
DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. 

5841
03:06:20,502 --> 03:06:23,005
CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU DECIDED 

5842
03:06:23,005 --> 03:06:26,408
TO TAKE THAT TEST? 

5843
03:06:26,408 --> 03:06:31,079
>>  I WAS MEETING WITH 

5844
03:06:31,079 --> 03:06:31,379
ATTORNEYS. 

5845
03:06:31,379 --> 03:06:32,381
I WAS INTERVIEWING VARIOUS 

5846
03:06:32,381 --> 03:06:33,781
ATTORNEYS AND THE ATTORNEYS 

5847
03:06:33,781 --> 03:06:35,284
ASKED IF I WAS WILLING TO TAKE 

5848
03:06:35,284 --> 03:06:38,420
IT AND I SAID ABSOLUTELY. 

5849
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:41,123
THAT SAID, IT WAS ALMOST AS 

5850
03:06:41,123 --> 03:06:42,424
ANXIETY PROVOKING AS AN 

5851
03:06:42,424 --> 03:06:42,925
AIRPLANE FLIGHT. 

5852
03:06:42,925 --> 03:06:44,025
>>  OKAY. 

5853
03:06:44,025 --> 03:06:46,428
AND YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT YOUR 

5854
03:06:46,428 --> 03:06:48,096
RECOLLECTIONS AND SEEING MARK 

5855
03:06:48,096 --> 03:06:49,096
JUDGE AT THAT SAFEWAY. 

5856
03:06:49,096 --> 03:06:50,832
IF THERE HAD BEEN AN 

5857
03:06:50,832 --> 03:06:52,234
APPROPRIATE REOPENING OF THIS 

5858
03:06:52,234 --> 03:06:54,403
BACKGROUND CHECK AND FBI 

5859
03:06:54,403 --> 03:06:55,437
INTERVIEWS, WOULD THAT HELP YOU 

5860
03:06:55,437 --> 03:06:56,505
FIND THE TIME PERIOD IF YOU 

5861
03:06:56,505 --> 03:06:58,307
KNEW WHEN HE WORKED AT THAT 

5862
03:06:58,307 --> 03:06:58,574
SAFEWAY? 

5863
03:06:58,574 --> 03:07:00,609
>>  I FEEL LIKE I COULD BE MUCH 

5864
03:07:00,609 --> 03:07:02,110
MORE HELPFUL IF I COULD BE 

5865
03:07:02,110 --> 03:07:04,379
PROVIDED WITH THAT DATE THROUGH 

5866
03:07:04,379 --> 03:07:06,982
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS OR THE IRS. 

5867
03:07:06,982 --> 03:07:07,249
ANYTHING. 

5868
03:07:07,249 --> 03:07:07,649
THAT WOULD HELP. 

5869
03:07:07,649 --> 03:07:12,087
>>  I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S TRUE. 

5870
03:07:12,087 --> 03:07:13,922
DR. FORD, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, 

5871
03:07:13,922 --> 03:07:16,024
STATEMENTS MADE TO MEDICAL 

5872
03:07:16,024 --> 03:07:17,092
PROFESSIONALS ARE CONSIDERED TO 

5873
03:07:17,092 --> 03:07:17,992
BE MORE RELIABLE. 

5874
03:07:17,992 --> 03:07:20,162
THERE'S A FEDERAL RULE OF 

5875
03:07:20,162 --> 03:07:21,530
EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS. 

5876
03:07:21,530 --> 03:07:23,432
YOU TOLD YOUR COUNSELOR ABOUT 

5877
03:07:23,432 --> 03:07:25,167
THIS BACK IN 2012. 

5878
03:07:25,167 --> 03:07:25,534
IS THAT RIGHT? 

5879
03:07:25,534 --> 03:07:28,336
>>  MY THERAPIST. 

5880
03:07:28,336 --> 03:07:29,071
MY INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST, 

5881
03:07:29,071 --> 03:07:29,404
CORRECT. 

5882
03:07:29,404 --> 03:07:30,438
>>  RIGHT. 

5883
03:07:30,438 --> 03:07:33,609
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR 

5884
03:07:33,609 --> 03:07:35,010
HUSBAND WAS ALSO PRESENT WHEN 

5885
03:07:35,010 --> 03:07:37,512
YOU SPOKE ABOUT THIS INCIDENT 

5886
03:07:37,512 --> 03:07:40,115
IN FRONT OF A COUNSELOR AND HE 

5887
03:07:40,115 --> 03:07:42,217
RECALLS YOU USING JUDGE 

5888
03:07:42,217 --> 03:07:42,884
KAVANAUGH'S NAME. 

5889
03:07:42,884 --> 03:07:43,251
IS THAT RIGHT? 

5890
03:07:43,251 --> 03:07:43,919
>>  YES. 

5891
03:07:43,919 --> 03:07:45,487
I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN A MINUTE 

5892
03:07:45,487 --> 03:07:47,856
BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN 

5893
03:07:47,856 --> 03:07:48,156
CONFUSING. 

5894
03:07:48,156 --> 03:07:49,524
THERE WERE TWO SEPARATE 

5895
03:07:49,524 --> 03:07:50,792
INCIDENTS WHERE IT'S REFLECTED 

5896
03:07:50,792 --> 03:07:52,160
IN MY MEDICAL RECORD. 

5897
03:07:52,160 --> 03:07:54,663
I TALKED ABOUT IT MORE THAN 

5898
03:07:54,663 --> 03:07:56,764
THOSE TWO TIMES, BUT THERAPISTS 

5899
03:07:56,764 --> 03:07:58,033
DON'T TYPICALLY WRITE DOWN 

5900
03:07:58,033 --> 03:08:00,369
CONTENT AS MUCH AS THEY WRITE 

5901
03:08:00,369 --> 03:08:00,702
DOWN PROCESS. 

5902
03:08:00,702 --> 03:08:02,204
THEY ARE USUALLY TRACKING YOUR 

5903
03:08:02,204 --> 03:08:04,506
SYMPTOMS AND NOT YOUR STORY AND 

5904
03:08:04,506 --> 03:08:04,806
THE FACTS. 

5905
03:08:04,806 --> 03:08:07,509
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE IT IN MY 

5906
03:08:07,509 --> 03:08:07,842
RECORD TWICE. 

5907
03:08:07,842 --> 03:08:10,412
SO, THE FIRST TIME IS IN 2012 

5908
03:08:10,412 --> 03:08:16,718
WITH MY HUSBAND IN COUPLES 

5909
03:08:16,718 --> 03:08:17,319
THERAPY. 

5910
03:08:17,319 --> 03:08:19,420
AND THEN IN 2013, WITH MY 

5911
03:08:19,420 --> 03:08:20,054
INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST. 

5912
03:08:20,054 --> 03:08:22,657
>>  SO IF SOMEONE HAD ACTUAL 

5913
03:08:22,657 --> 03:08:23,758
DONE AN INVESTIGATION, YOUR 

5914
03:08:23,758 --> 03:08:25,260
HUSBAND WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

5915
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:26,461
SAY YOU NAMED HIS NAME AT THAT 

5916
03:08:26,461 --> 03:08:26,661
TIME. 

5917
03:08:26,661 --> 03:08:27,628
>>  CORRECT. 

5918
03:08:27,628 --> 03:08:30,232
>>  OKAY. 

5919
03:08:30,232 --> 03:08:30,632
I KNOW -- 2012. 

5920
03:08:30,632 --> 03:08:32,834
>>  I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN 

5921
03:08:32,834 --> 03:08:33,869
CONCERNED WITH YOUR PRIVACY 

5922
03:08:33,869 --> 03:08:35,504
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND YOU 

5923
03:08:35,504 --> 03:08:37,005
FIRST REQUESTED YOUR ACCOUNT 

5924
03:08:37,005 --> 03:08:37,772
WITH KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. 

5925
03:08:37,772 --> 03:08:42,110
CAN YOU TELL US WHY. 

5926
03:08:42,110 --> 03:08:44,313
>>  YES. 

5927
03:08:44,313 --> 03:08:48,617
SO AS I STATED BEFORE, ONCE I 

5928
03:08:48,617 --> 03:08:51,820
WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN GETTING MY 

5929
03:08:51,820 --> 03:08:53,955
INFORMATION TO YOU BEFORE THE 

5930
03:08:53,955 --> 03:08:55,257
CANDIDATE WAS CHOSEN, MY 

5931
03:08:55,257 --> 03:08:57,859
ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO GET THE 

5932
03:08:57,859 --> 03:08:59,161
INFORMATION WHEN THERE WAS 

5933
03:08:59,161 --> 03:09:03,064
STILL A LIST OF OTHER 

5934
03:09:03,064 --> 03:09:03,564
CANDIDATES AVAILABLE. 

5935
03:09:03,564 --> 03:09:06,068
AND ONCE THAT WAS NOT 

5936
03:09:06,068 --> 03:09:07,969
SUCCESSFUL AND I SAW THAT 

5937
03:09:07,969 --> 03:09:11,640
PERSONS WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 

5938
03:09:11,640 --> 03:09:13,074
THE NOMINEE. 

5939
03:09:13,074 --> 03:09:15,744
I TRACKED IT ALL SUMMER AND 

5940
03:09:15,744 --> 03:09:18,113
REALIZED THAT WHEN I WAS 

5941
03:09:18,113 --> 03:09:19,214
CALCULATING THAT RISK BENEFIT 

5942
03:09:19,214 --> 03:09:21,616
RATIO, IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS 

5943
03:09:21,616 --> 03:09:23,384
GOING TO JUST SUFFER ONLY FOR 

5944
03:09:23,384 --> 03:09:23,685
NO REASON. 

5945
03:09:23,685 --> 03:09:24,819
>>  OKAY. 

5946
03:09:24,819 --> 03:09:27,856
YOU KNOW FROM MY EXPERIENCE 

5947
03:09:27,856 --> 03:09:29,157
WITH MEMORY, I REMEMBER 

5948
03:09:29,157 --> 03:09:30,091
DISTINCTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED 

5949
03:09:30,091 --> 03:09:31,560
TO ME IN HIGH SCHOOL OR 

5950
03:09:31,560 --> 03:09:33,461
HAPPENED TO ME IN COLLEGE. 

5951
03:09:33,461 --> 03:09:36,465
BUT I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER 

5952
03:09:36,465 --> 03:09:36,732
THE DATE. 

5953
03:09:36,732 --> 03:09:39,568
I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER THE 

5954
03:09:39,568 --> 03:09:39,768
TIME. 

5955
03:09:39,768 --> 03:09:40,969
I SOMETIMES MAY NOT REMEMBER 

5956
03:09:40,969 --> 03:09:42,737
THE EXACT PLACE WHERE IT 

5957
03:09:42,737 --> 03:09:43,004
OCCURRED. 

5958
03:09:43,004 --> 03:09:45,273
BUT I REMEMBER THE INTERACTION. 

5959
03:09:45,273 --> 03:09:47,442
AND MANY PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED 

5960
03:09:47,442 --> 03:09:48,844
TODAY ON WHAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE 

5961
03:09:48,844 --> 03:09:50,678
TO REMEMBER ABOUT THAT NIGHT. 

5962
03:09:50,678 --> 03:09:52,147
I ACTUALLY THINK YOU REMEMBER A 

5963
03:09:52,147 --> 03:09:52,347
LOT. 

5964
03:09:52,347 --> 03:09:53,849
I'M GOING TO PHRASE IT 

5965
03:09:53,849 --> 03:09:54,182
DIFFERENTLY. 

5966
03:09:54,182 --> 03:09:56,852
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU DON'T 

5967
03:09:56,852 --> 03:09:59,854
FORGET ABOUT THAT NIGHT. 

5968
03:09:59,854 --> 03:10:04,693
>>  THE STAIRWELL. 

5969
03:10:04,693 --> 03:10:06,561
THE LIVING ROOM. 

5970
03:10:06,561 --> 03:10:06,894
THE BEDROOM. 

5971
03:10:06,894 --> 03:10:08,997
THE BED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF 

5972
03:10:08,997 --> 03:10:10,465
THE ROOM AS YOU WALK INTO THE 

5973
03:10:10,465 --> 03:10:10,665
ROOM. 

5974
03:10:10,665 --> 03:10:14,069
THERE WAS A BED TO THE RIGHT. 

5975
03:10:14,069 --> 03:10:20,542
THE BATHROOM IN CLOSE 

5976
03:10:20,542 --> 03:10:20,842
PROXIMITY. 

5977
03:10:20,842 --> 03:10:22,610
THE LAUGHTER. 

5978
03:10:22,610 --> 03:10:23,411
THE UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. 

5979
03:10:23,411 --> 03:10:27,015
AND THE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO 

5980
03:10:27,015 --> 03:10:29,584
ESCAPE AND THE FINAL ABILITY TO 

5981
03:10:29,584 --> 03:10:29,851
DO SO. 

5982
03:10:29,851 --> 03:10:33,554
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR. 

5983
03:10:33,554 --> 03:10:33,755
FORD. 

5984
03:10:33,755 --> 03:10:37,159
>>  DR. FORD, I WANT TO CORRECT 

5985
03:10:37,159 --> 03:10:37,459
THE RECORD. 

5986
03:10:37,459 --> 03:10:38,860
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M SAYING 

5987
03:10:38,860 --> 03:10:40,796
THAT YOU STATED WRONGLY BECAUSE 

5988
03:10:40,796 --> 03:10:44,433
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE FACT THAT 

5989
03:10:44,433 --> 03:10:46,601
WHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T 

5990
03:10:46,601 --> 03:10:50,639
THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR US TO 

5991
03:10:50,639 --> 03:10:51,239
OR INVESTIGATORS GO TO OMMITTEE 

5992
03:10:51,239 --> 03:10:54,443
CALIFORNIA TO TALK TO YOU, WE 

5993
03:10:54,443 --> 03:10:56,511
DID IN FACT OFFER THAT TO YOU 

5994
03:10:56,511 --> 03:10:57,946
AND WE HAD THE CAPABILITY OF 

5995
03:10:57,946 --> 03:11:00,749
DOING IT AND WE WOULD HAVE DONE 

5996
03:11:00,749 --> 03:11:02,683
IT ANYWHERE OR ANY TIME. 

5997
03:11:02,683 --> 03:11:04,252
>>  THANK YOU. 

5998
03:11:04,252 --> 03:11:05,954
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN, COULD I PUT 

5999
03:11:05,954 --> 03:11:08,790
THE POLYGRAPH RESULTS ON THE 

6000
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:09,257
RECORD, PLEASE. 

6001
03:11:09,257 --> 03:11:13,261
THE POLYGRAPH RESULTS IN THE 

6002
03:11:13,261 --> 03:11:13,494
RECORD. 

6003
03:11:13,494 --> 03:11:14,663
IS THERE ANY OBJECTION? 

6004
03:11:14,663 --> 03:11:16,531
>>  LET US SEE THE CHART. 

6005
03:11:16,531 --> 03:11:18,566
>>  THE POLYGRAPH. 

6006
03:11:18,566 --> 03:11:20,334
YOU WANT TO SEE IT? 

6007
03:11:20,334 --> 03:11:23,938
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE IT. 

6008
03:11:23,938 --> 03:11:29,344
>>  CAN WE HAVE THE UNDERLYING 

6009
03:11:29,344 --> 03:11:29,677
CHARTS, TOO? 

6010
03:11:29,677 --> 03:11:30,946
>>  I HAVE THE POLYGRAPH 

6011
03:11:30,946 --> 03:11:32,514
RESULTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO 

6012
03:11:32,514 --> 03:11:33,581
PUT IN THE RECORD. 

6013
03:11:33,581 --> 03:11:35,550
I'LL DEAL WITH THE CHARTS AFTER 

6014
03:11:35,550 --> 03:11:35,750
THAT. 

6015
03:11:35,750 --> 03:11:38,553
COULD I PUT THE POLYGRAPH TEST 

6016
03:11:38,553 --> 03:11:38,920
IN THE RECORD? 

6017
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:42,891
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN, WE HAD 

6018
03:11:42,891 --> 03:11:45,459
PROPOSED HAVING THE POLYGRAPH 

6019
03:11:45,459 --> 03:11:46,928
EXAMINER TESTIFY, AS YOU KNOW. 

6020
03:11:46,928 --> 03:11:50,198
IF THAT HAD HAPPENED, THE FULL 

6021
03:11:50,198 --> 03:11:52,767
MATERIALS HE HAD SUPPORTING HIS 

6022
03:11:52,767 --> 03:11:54,903
EXAMINATION WOULD HAVE BEEN 

6023
03:11:54,903 --> 03:11:55,170
PROVIDED. 

6024
03:11:55,170 --> 03:11:56,338
YOU REJECTED THAT REQUEST. 

6025
03:11:56,338 --> 03:11:58,239
SO WHAT WE DID PROVIDE WAS THE 

6026
03:11:58,239 --> 03:11:59,240
POLYGRAPH REPORT, WHICH IS WHAT 

6027
03:11:59,240 --> 03:12:00,775
THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 

6028
03:12:00,775 --> 03:12:01,142
CURRENTLY HAVE. 

6029
03:12:01,142 --> 03:12:03,545
>>  AND ON SEPTEMBER 26, MR. 

6030
03:12:03,545 --> 03:12:05,046
CHAIRMAN, THIS WAS ACTUALLY 

6031
03:12:05,046 --> 03:12:06,113
SENT TO YOUR CHIEF COUNSEL. 

6032
03:12:06,113 --> 03:12:08,249
I JUST WANT TO SHARE IT WITH 

6033
03:12:08,249 --> 03:12:09,551
AMERICA SO THAT THEY HAVE THIS 

6034
03:12:09,551 --> 03:12:10,251
REPORT AS WELL. 

6035
03:12:10,251 --> 03:12:12,454
>>  OKAY, WE WILL ACCEPT 

6036
03:12:12,454 --> 03:12:14,389
WITHOUT OBJECTION WHAT YOU HAVE 

6037
03:12:14,389 --> 03:12:15,856
ASKED US TO INCLUDE. 

6038
03:12:15,856 --> 03:12:18,293
WE ARE ALSO REQUESTING AND 

6039
03:12:18,293 --> 03:12:19,861
EXPECT THE OTHER MATERIALS THAT 

6040
03:12:19,861 --> 03:12:20,328
I JUST STATED. 

6041
03:12:20,328 --> 03:12:22,464
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU WOULDN'T 

6042
03:12:22,464 --> 03:12:23,665
ALLOW THE UNDERLYING WITNESS 

6043
03:12:23,665 --> 03:12:24,900
WHO PERFORMED THE POLYGRAPH 

6044
03:12:24,900 --> 03:12:27,502
TEST TO TESTIFY NOR WOULD YOU 

6045
03:12:27,502 --> 03:12:28,703
ALLOW MARK JUDGE TO TESTIFY. 

6046
03:12:28,703 --> 03:12:30,071
SO, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT 

6047
03:12:30,071 --> 03:12:31,272
OUT, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING 

6048
03:12:31,272 --> 03:12:32,841
THIS REPORT IN THE RECORD, BUT 

6049
03:12:32,841 --> 03:12:34,142
THAT IS THE REASON THAT WE 

6050
03:12:34,142 --> 03:12:35,744
DON'T HAVE THE UNDERLYING 

6051
03:12:35,744 --> 03:12:36,211
INFORMATION FOR YOU. 

6052
03:12:36,211 --> 03:12:38,546
>>  YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED. 

6053
03:12:38,546 --> 03:12:39,881
I THINK YOU WOULD BE SATISFIED. 

6054
03:12:39,881 --> 03:12:42,250
>>  I AM SATISFIED WITH THAT, 

6055
03:12:42,250 --> 03:12:42,583
THANK YOU. 

6056
03:12:42,583 --> 03:12:43,785
>>  SENATOR, GO AHEAD. 

6057
03:12:43,785 --> 03:12:46,754
>>  WHEN WAS THE POLYGRAPH 

6058
03:12:46,754 --> 03:12:47,088
ADMINISTERED? 

6059
03:12:47,088 --> 03:12:52,994
>>  IT WAS ADMINISTERED ON 

6060
03:12:52,994 --> 03:12:54,396
AUGUST 7, 2018, AND IT WAS THE 

6061
03:12:54,396 --> 03:12:57,065
DATE OF THE REPORT IS AUGUST 

6062
03:12:57,065 --> 03:12:57,499
10, 2018. 

6063
03:12:57,499 --> 03:12:59,601
>>  WHEN WAS IT PROVIDED TO THE 

6064
03:12:59,601 --> 03:12:59,901
COMMITTEE? 

6065
03:12:59,901 --> 03:13:01,403
>>  LET'S SEE IF WE CAN'T DO 

6066
03:13:01,403 --> 03:13:03,071
THIS IN A MORE ORDERLY WAY. 

6067
03:13:03,071 --> 03:13:04,872
>>  HE WAS ASKING AND I HAVE IT 

6068
03:13:04,872 --> 03:13:07,375
RIGHT HERE AND YOU HAVE IT AS 

6069
03:13:07,375 --> 03:13:08,476
WELL  IT WAS SEPTEMBER 26. 

6070
03:13:08,476 --> 03:13:13,180
>>  WE HAVE ACCEPTED IT. 

6071
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:17,952
>>  MS. MITCHELL, FOR SENATOR 

6072
03:13:17,952 --> 03:13:18,987
CRUZ. 

6073
03:13:18,987 --> 03:13:21,489
>>  THANK YOU. 

6074
03:13:21,489 --> 03:13:22,824
DR. FORD, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT 

6075
03:13:22,824 --> 03:13:24,292
THE DAY AND THE NIGHT THAT 

6076
03:13:24,292 --> 03:13:26,728
YOU'VE DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMER 

6077
03:13:26,728 --> 03:13:26,995
OF 1982. 

6078
03:13:26,995 --> 03:13:29,597
THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO 

6079
03:13:29,597 --> 03:13:30,298
DO THAT. 

6080
03:13:30,298 --> 03:13:31,799
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT. 

6081
03:13:31,799 --> 03:13:34,202
I WOULD LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS AND 

6082
03:13:34,202 --> 03:13:37,505
DISCUSS THE LAST SEVERAL 

6083
03:13:37,505 --> 03:13:37,738
MONTHS. 

6084
03:13:37,738 --> 03:13:38,072
>>  OKAY. 

6085
03:13:38,072 --> 03:13:44,079
>>  IN YOUR STATEMENT, YOU SAID 

6086
03:13:44,079 --> 03:13:46,448
THAT ON JULY 6, YOU HAD A QUOTE 

6087
03:13:46,448 --> 03:13:48,650
SENSE OF URGENCY TO RELAY THE 

6088
03:13:48,650 --> 03:13:52,153
INFORMATION TO THE SENATE AND 

6089
03:13:52,153 --> 03:13:52,654
THE PRESIDENT. 

6090
03:13:52,654 --> 03:13:54,322
DID YOU CONTACT EITHER THE 

6091
03:13:54,322 --> 03:13:59,059
SENATE OR THE PRESIDENT ON OR 

6092
03:13:59,059 --> 03:13:59,426
BEFORE JULY 6? 

6093
03:13:59,426 --> 03:14:00,595
>>  I DID NOT. 

6094
03:14:00,595 --> 03:14:02,197
I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. 

6095
03:14:02,197 --> 03:14:05,700
>>  OKAY. 

6096
03:14:05,700 --> 03:14:08,536
PRIOR TO JULY 6, HAD YOU SPOKEN 

6097
03:14:08,536 --> 03:14:09,837
TO ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS? 

6098
03:14:09,837 --> 03:14:11,272
WHEN I SAY CONGRESS, I MEAN THE 

6099
03:14:11,272 --> 03:14:13,675
SENATE OR THE HOUSE OF 

6100
03:14:13,675 --> 03:14:14,876
REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY 

6101
03:14:14,876 --> 03:14:17,245
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MEMBERS 

6102
03:14:17,245 --> 03:14:19,013
ABOUT YOUR ALLEGATIONS? 

6103
03:14:19,013 --> 03:14:20,047
>>  NO. 

6104
03:14:20,047 --> 03:14:23,017
>>  WHY DID YOU CONTACT THE 

6105
03:14:23,017 --> 03:14:26,521
WASHINGTON POST ON JULY 6? 

6106
03:14:26,521 --> 03:14:28,690
>>  SO, I WAS PANICKING BECAUSE 

6107
03:14:28,690 --> 03:14:32,293
I KNEW THE TIME LINE WAS SHORT 

6108
03:14:32,293 --> 03:14:35,362
FOR THE DECISION. 

6109
03:14:35,362 --> 03:14:38,700
PEOPLE WERE GIVING ME ADVICE ON 

6110
03:14:38,700 --> 03:14:39,233
THE BEACH. 

6111
03:14:39,233 --> 03:14:42,770
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE 

6112
03:14:42,770 --> 03:14:43,070

6113
03:14:43,070 --> 03:14:44,973
BUT THEY WERE GIVING ME ADVICE 

6114
03:14:44,973 --> 03:14:46,674
AND MANY PEOPLE TOLD ME, YOU 

6115
03:14:46,674 --> 03:14:47,708
NEED TO HIRE A LAWYER. 

6116
03:14:47,708 --> 03:14:48,777
I DIDN'T DO THAT. 

6117
03:14:48,777 --> 03:14:53,048
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WOULD 

6118
03:14:53,048 --> 03:14:53,514

6119
03:14:53,514 --> 03:14:55,750
SOMEBODY SAID, CALL THE "NEW

WHEN I WEIGHED THOSE OPTIONS, I

6127
03:15:08,797 --> 03:15:13,001

BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT 

6293
03:20:19,941 --> 03:20:22,243
WHILE THERE WAS STILL A SHORT 

6294
03:20:22,243 --> 03:20:22,743
LIST OF CANDIDATES. 

6295
03:20:22,743 --> 03:20:26,147
>>  THANK YOU DOCTOR. 

6296
03:20:26,147 --> 03:20:27,448
ACCORDING TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 

6297
03:20:27,448 --> 03:20:29,751
DATA, 2/3 OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

6298
03:20:29,751 --> 03:20:31,552
SURVIVORS DON'T REPORT THEIR 

6299
03:20:31,552 --> 03:20:32,019
ASSAULTS. 

6300
03:20:32,019 --> 03:20:33,154
BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE, I 

6301
03:20:33,154 --> 03:20:34,789
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING 

6302
03:20:34,789 --> 03:20:37,158
FROM YOU ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU 

6303
03:20:37,158 --> 03:20:37,558
BORE THIS ALONE. 

6304
03:20:37,558 --> 03:20:40,495
YOU BORE THIS ALONE FOR A VERY 

6305
03:20:40,495 --> 03:20:41,596
LONG TIME. 

6306
03:20:41,596 --> 03:20:42,930
AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US 

6307
03:20:42,930 --> 03:20:45,800
TO UNDERSTAND THE WAYS HOW THAT 

6308
03:20:45,800 --> 03:20:46,600
IMPACTED YOUR WHOLE LIFE. 

6309
03:20:46,600 --> 03:20:50,271
>>  WELL, IT'S IMPACTED ME AT 

6310
03:20:50,271 --> 03:20:50,872
DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE 

6311
03:20:50,872 --> 03:20:54,142
DEVELOPMENT OF MY LIFE. 

6312
03:20:54,142 --> 03:20:55,343
THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT WAS 

6313
03:20:55,343 --> 03:20:56,076
PROBABLY THE WORST. 

6314
03:20:56,076 --> 03:20:58,980
SO THE FIRST FOUR YEARS, I 

6315
03:20:58,980 --> 03:21:01,849
THINK I DESCRIBED EARLIER A 

6316
03:21:01,849 --> 03:21:03,851
FAIRLY DISASTROUS FIRST TWO 

6317
03:21:03,851 --> 03:21:07,054
YEARS OF UNDER GRADUATE STUDIES 

6318
03:21:07,054 --> 03:21:07,889
AT UNIVERSITY OF NORTH 

6319
03:21:07,889 --> 03:21:08,289
CAROLINA. 

6320
03:21:08,289 --> 03:21:14,595
I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PULL 

6321
03:21:14,595 --> 03:21:18,466
MYSELF TOGETHER AND THEN ONCE 

6322
03:21:18,466 --> 03:21:20,535
COPING WITH THE IMMEDIATE 

6323
03:21:20,535 --> 03:21:21,969
IMPACTS, THE SHORT-TERM 

6324
03:21:21,969 --> 03:21:24,772
IMPACTS, I EXPERIENCED LONGER 

6325
03:21:24,772 --> 03:21:27,007
TERM IMPACTS OF ANXIETY AND 

6326
03:21:27,007 --> 03:21:27,541
RELATIONSHIP CHALLENGES. 

6327
03:21:27,541 --> 03:21:28,843
>>  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. 

6328
03:21:28,843 --> 03:21:31,846
AND YET YOU WENT ON TO GET A 

6329
03:21:31,846 --> 03:21:32,946
PHD FROM USC, IS THAT CORRECT? 

6330
03:21:32,946 --> 03:21:34,548
>>  CORRECT. 

6331
03:21:34,548 --> 03:21:36,751
>>  AS YOU PREDICTED, THERE WAS 

6332
03:21:36,751 --> 03:21:40,488
A WIDE RANGE OF RESPONSES TO 

6333
03:21:40,488 --> 03:21:41,755
YOUR COMING FORWARD. 

6334
03:21:41,755 --> 03:21:42,990
SOME THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS 

6335
03:21:42,990 --> 03:21:44,125
HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED AND 

6336
03:21:44,125 --> 03:21:46,194
INSPIRED BY YOUR COURAGE. 

6337
03:21:46,194 --> 03:21:47,260
OTHERS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL. 

6338
03:21:47,260 --> 03:21:49,297
AND AS I'VE REVIEWED THE WIDE 

6339
03:21:49,297 --> 03:21:50,598
RANGE OF REACTIONS, I'VE BEEN 

6340
03:21:50,598 --> 03:21:53,601
TROUBLED BY THE EXCUSE OFFERED 

6341
03:21:53,601 --> 03:21:54,001
BY TOO MANY. 

6342
03:21:54,001 --> 03:21:55,403
THIS WAS A HIGH SCHOOL INCIDENT 

6343
03:21:55,403 --> 03:21:57,872
AND BOYS WILL BE BOYS. 

6344
03:21:57,872 --> 03:22:00,374
TO ME, THAT IS JUST FAR TOO LOW 

6345
03:22:00,374 --> 03:22:01,676
A STANDARD FOR THE CONDUCT OF 

6346
03:22:01,676 --> 03:22:03,310
BOYS AND MEN IN OUR COUNTRY. 

6347
03:22:03,310 --> 03:22:04,445
IF YOU WOULD, I WOULD 

6348
03:22:04,445 --> 03:22:05,880
APPRECIATE YOUR REACTION TO THE 

6349
03:22:05,880 --> 03:22:10,151
EXCUSE THAT BOYS WILL BE BOYS. 

6350
03:22:10,151 --> 03:22:13,187
>>  I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR HOW IT 

6351
03:22:13,187 --> 03:22:15,389
HAS IMPACTED ME GREATLY FOR THE 

6352
03:22:15,389 --> 03:22:16,223
LAST 36 YEARS. 

6353
03:22:16,223 --> 03:22:19,026
EVEN THOUGH I WAS 15 YEARS OLD 

6354
03:22:19,026 --> 03:22:20,594
AT THE TIME. 

6355
03:22:20,594 --> 03:22:22,797
AND I THINK THE YOUNGER YOU ARE 

6356
03:22:22,797 --> 03:22:25,399
WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN, IT 

6357
03:22:25,399 --> 03:22:26,534
CAN POSSIBLY HAVE WORSE IMPACT 

6358
03:22:26,534 --> 03:22:30,204
THAN WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS FULLY 

6359
03:22:30,204 --> 03:22:31,772
DEVELOPED AND YOU HAVE BETTER 

6360
03:22:31,772 --> 03:22:34,274
COPING SKILLS THAT YOU 

6361
03:22:34,274 --> 03:22:34,775
DEVELOPED. 

6362
03:22:34,775 --> 03:22:37,879
>>  EXPERTS HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT 

6363
03:22:37,879 --> 03:22:40,114
HOW IT IS COMMON FOR SEXUAL 

6364
03:22:40,114 --> 03:22:41,082
ASSAULT SURVIVORS TO REMEMBER 

6365
03:22:41,082 --> 03:22:43,184
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE 

6366
03:22:43,184 --> 03:22:44,986
VERY SHARPLY AND VERY CLEARLY, 

6367
03:22:44,986 --> 03:22:45,353
BUT NOT OTHERS. 

6368
03:22:45,353 --> 03:22:47,188
THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE 

6369
03:22:47,188 --> 03:22:50,558
SURVIVAL MODE THAT WE GO INTO 

6370
03:22:50,558 --> 03:22:51,358
IN EXPERIENCING TRAUMA. 

6371
03:22:51,358 --> 03:22:52,793
IS THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE AND IS 

6372
03:22:52,793 --> 03:22:55,930
THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN HELP THE 

6373
03:22:55,930 --> 03:22:56,430
LEI PERSON UNDERSTAND? 

6374
03:22:56,430 --> 03:22:58,199
>>  YES. 

6375
03:22:58,199 --> 03:22:59,032
I WAS DEFINITELY EXPERIENCING 

6376
03:22:59,032 --> 03:23:00,835
THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT MODE, IS 

6377
03:23:00,835 --> 03:23:03,271
THAT WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO? 

6378
03:23:03,271 --> 03:23:04,272
I WAS DEFINITELY EXPERIENCING 

6379
03:23:04,272 --> 03:23:10,878
THE SURGE OF ADRENALINE AND 

6380
03:23:10,878 --> 03:23:11,545
CORTIZOL AND CREDIT THAT WITH 

6381
03:23:11,545 --> 03:23:13,781
THE ABILITY TO GET OUT OF THE 

6382
03:23:13,781 --> 03:23:14,081
SITUATION. 

6383
03:23:14,081 --> 03:23:16,984
BUT ALSO SOME OTHER LUCKY 

6384
03:23:16,984 --> 03:23:18,119
EVENTS THAT OCCURRED THAT 

6385
03:23:18,119 --> 03:23:19,086
ALLOWED ME TO GET OUT OF THE 

6386
03:23:19,086 --> 03:23:19,587
EVENT. 

6387
03:23:19,587 --> 03:23:21,955
>>  DR. FORD, WE ARE GRATEFUL 

6388
03:23:21,955 --> 03:23:23,624
THAT YOU CAME THROUGH IT AND 

6389
03:23:23,624 --> 03:23:24,725
YOU SHARED YOUR ACCOUNT WITH US 

6390
03:23:24,725 --> 03:23:27,795
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I 

6391
03:23:27,795 --> 03:23:29,029
THINK YOU'VE PROVIDED IMPORTANT 

6392
03:23:29,029 --> 03:23:29,329
INFORMATIN. 

6393
03:23:29,329 --> 03:23:30,998
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

6394
03:23:30,998 --> 03:23:32,232
MEETING YOUR CIVIC DUTY. 

6395
03:23:32,232 --> 03:23:34,201
I WISH WE COULD HAVE PROVIDED 

6396
03:23:34,201 --> 03:23:35,803
FOR YOU A MORE THOROUGH HEARING 

6397
03:23:35,803 --> 03:23:36,070
TODAY. 

6398
03:23:36,070 --> 03:23:38,406
I THINK ASKING FOR THE FBI TO 

6399
03:23:38,406 --> 03:23:39,206
INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER 

6400
03:23:39,206 --> 03:23:40,975
THOROUGHLY WAS NOT ASKING TOO 

6401
03:23:40,975 --> 03:23:41,175
MUCH. 

6402
03:23:41,175 --> 03:23:44,078
I THINK ASKING TO HAVE THE 

6403
03:23:44,078 --> 03:23:46,380
OTHER INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED IN 

6404
03:23:46,380 --> 03:23:47,280
YOUR ASSAULT, MARK JUDGE, 

6405
03:23:47,280 --> 03:23:50,418
APPEAR BEFORE US TODAY, WAS NOT 

6406
03:23:50,418 --> 03:23:51,185
ASKING TOO MUCH. 

6407
03:23:51,185 --> 03:23:53,187
I AM GRATEFUL YOU CAME FORWARD 

6408
03:23:53,187 --> 03:23:58,926
AND GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COURAGE 

6409
03:23:58,926 --> 03:24:00,194
THAT SET AN EXAMPLE. 

6410
03:24:00,194 --> 03:24:02,630
>>  DR. FORD, WE WERE TALKING 

6411
03:24:02,630 --> 03:24:06,100
ABOUT YOU MEETING IN JULY WITH 

6412
03:24:06,100 --> 03:24:06,567
CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO. 

6413
03:24:06,567 --> 03:24:08,336
DID YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR 

6414
03:24:08,336 --> 03:24:09,870
ALLEGATIONS WITH ANY REPUBLICAN 

6415
03:24:09,870 --> 03:24:11,706
MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR 

6416
03:24:11,706 --> 03:24:12,173
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF? 

6417
03:24:12,173 --> 03:24:14,275
>>  I DID NOT. 

6418
03:24:14,275 --> 03:24:17,111
WHERE I LIVE, THE CONGRESSWOMAN 

6419
03:24:17,111 --> 03:24:19,013
IS A DEMOCRAT. 

6420
03:24:19,013 --> 03:24:20,514
>>  OKAY. 

6421
03:24:20,514 --> 03:24:22,583
WAS IT COMMUNICATED TO YOU BY 

6422
03:24:22,583 --> 03:24:25,886
YOUR COUNSEL OR SOMEONE ELSE 

6423
03:24:25,886 --> 03:24:28,222
THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED TO 

6424
03:24:28,222 --> 03:24:29,623
INTERVIEW YOU AND THEY OFFERED 

6425
03:24:29,623 --> 03:24:31,892
TO COME OUT TO CALIFORNIA TO DO 

6426
03:24:31,892 --> 03:24:32,058
SO? 

6427
03:24:32,058 --> 03:24:34,929
>>  WE'RE GOING TO OBJECT, MR. 

6428
03:24:34,929 --> 03:24:37,832
CHAIRMAN, TO ANY CALL FOR 

6429
03:24:37,832 --> 03:24:38,365
PRIVILEGED CONVERSATIONS 

6430
03:24:38,365 --> 03:24:43,003
BETWEEN COUNSEL AND DR. FORD. 

6431
03:24:43,003 --> 03:24:45,773
>>  COULD YOU VALIDATE THE FACT 

6432
03:24:45,773 --> 03:24:49,310
THAT THE OFFER WAS MADE WITHOUT 

6433
03:24:49,310 --> 03:24:52,479
HER SAYING A WORD? 

6434
03:24:52,479 --> 03:24:54,115
>>  IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THAT 

6435
03:24:54,115 --> 03:25:00,388
QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED WITHOUT 

6436
03:25:00,388 --> 03:25:00,888
VIOLATING ANY COUNSEL 

6437
03:25:00,888 --> 03:25:01,255
RELATIONSHIPS? 

6438
03:25:01,255 --> 03:25:03,224
>>  CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU, 

6439
03:25:03,224 --> 03:25:05,626
DO YOU MIND IF I SAY SOMETHING 

6440
03:25:05,626 --> 03:25:06,126
TO YOU DIRECTLY? 

6441
03:25:06,126 --> 03:25:07,828
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU DID OFFER 

6442
03:25:07,828 --> 03:25:08,028
THAT. 

6443
03:25:08,028 --> 03:25:09,330
I WASN'T CLEAR ON WHAT THE 

6444
03:25:09,330 --> 03:25:10,831
OFFER WAS, IF YOU WERE GOING TO 

6445
03:25:10,831 --> 03:25:12,533
COME OUT TO SEE ME, I WOULD 

6446
03:25:12,533 --> 03:25:15,035
HAVE HAPPILY HOSTED YOU AND HAD 

6447
03:25:15,035 --> 03:25:17,204
BEEN HAPPY TO SPEAK TO YOU OUT 

6448
03:25:17,204 --> 03:25:17,505
THERE. 

6449
03:25:17,505 --> 03:25:19,907
I WASN'T CLEAR TO BE THAT WAS 

6450
03:25:19,907 --> 03:25:20,173
THE CASE. 

6451
03:25:20,173 --> 03:25:22,676
>>  OKAY, DOES THAT TAKE CARE 

6452
03:25:22,676 --> 03:25:23,076
OF YOUR QUESTION? 

6453
03:25:23,076 --> 03:25:24,111
>>  YES. 

6454
03:25:24,111 --> 03:25:28,516
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6455
03:25:28,516 --> 03:25:28,849
PROCEED THEN. 

6456
03:25:28,849 --> 03:25:31,385
>>  BEFORE JULY 30, THE DATE ON 

6457
03:25:31,385 --> 03:25:34,922
YOUR LETTER TO SENATOR 

6458
03:25:34,922 --> 03:25:36,624
FEINSTEIN, HAD YOU RETAINED 

6459
03:25:36,624 --> 03:25:37,758
COUNSEL WITH REGARD TO THESE 

6460
03:25:37,758 --> 03:25:38,192
ALLEGATIONS? 

6461
03:25:38,192 --> 03:25:40,393
>> NO. 

6462
03:25:40,393 --> 03:25:43,831
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WOULD 

6463
03:25:43,831 --> 03:25:44,464
NEED LAWYERS, ACTUALLY. 

6464
03:25:44,464 --> 03:25:44,831
I DIDN'T KNOW. 

6465
03:25:44,831 --> 03:25:49,703
>>  A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT 

6466
03:25:49,703 --> 03:25:50,538
FEELING. 

6467
03:25:50,538 --> 03:25:52,907
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LETTER 

6468
03:25:52,907 --> 03:25:55,876
THAT YOU WROTE ON JULY 30. 

6469
03:25:55,876 --> 03:26:01,381
YOU ASKED SENATOR FEINSTEIN TO 

6470
03:26:01,381 --> 03:26:05,152
REMAIN  CONFIDENTIALITY -- 

6471
03:26:05,152 --> 03:26:07,121

03:26:07,121 --> 03:26:07,321
IT. 

6473
03:26:07,321 --> 03:26:11,058
>>  STOP THE CLOCK, WILL YOU? 

6474
03:26:11,058 --> 03:26:14,562
IT'S IN THERE SOME PLACE. 

6475
03:26:14,562 --> 03:26:15,228

6477
03:26:19,767 --> 03:26:21,235
TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY 

6478
03:26:21,235 --> 03:26:22,970
UNTIL WE HAVE HAD FURTHER 

6479
03:26:22,970 --> 03:26:23,904
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. 

6480
03:26:23,904 --> 03:26:25,606

6482
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:28,975
VACATIONING IN THE MID ATLANTIC

6484
03:26:35,516 --> 03:26:35,783
CORRECT?

03:26:35,783 --> 03:26:39,320
>>  THE LAST LINE, IS THAT WHAT 

6486
03:26:39,320 --> 03:26:40,955
YOU ARE REFERRING -- SORRY, I'M 

6487
03:26:40,955 --> 03:26:41,455
A LITTLE SLOWER. 

6488
03:26:41,455 --> 03:26:43,758
MY MIND IS GETTING TIRED. 

6489
03:26:43,758 --> 03:26:44,859
I'M AVAILABLE TO SPEAK FURTHER 

6490
03:26:44,859 --> 03:26:46,326
IF YOU WISH TO DISCUSS. 

6491
03:26:46,326 --> 03:26:50,464
YES, I WAS IN DELAWARE UNTIL

6493

6501
03:27:05,145 --> 03:27:07,648

TO HAND DELIVER IT TO SENATOR 

6506
03:27:12,620 --> 03:27:13,621

6508
03:27:14,354 --> 03:27:15,689
DID ANYONE HELP YOU WRITE THE 

6509
03:27:15,689 --> 03:27:15,922

I ANSWERED THOSE QUESTIONS. 

6534
03:27:57,864 --> 03:28:01,569
>>  WAS THAT THE EXTENT, THE 

6535
03:28:01,569 --> 03:28:02,102
GIST OF THE CONVERSATION? 

6536
03:28:02,102 --> 03:28:03,570

6559
03:28:51,752 --> 03:28:53,186
LAWYERS SHE COULD HAVE SPOKEN 

6560

I WAS INTERVIEWING LAWYERS. 

6565
03:29:02,696 --> 03:29:04,098
I WAS NOT SPEAKING PERSONALLY 

6566
03:29:04,098 --> 03:29:04,365

03:29:08,469 --> 03:29:10,371
TO REPRESENT YOU, DID YOU SPEAK 

6570
03:29:10,371 --> 03:29:11,372
TO ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT IT DURING 

6571
03:29:11,372 --> 03:29:12,640
THAT PERIOD OF TIME? 

6572
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:13,440

IT? 

6578
03:29:17,944 --> 03:29:20,447
>>  DEFINITELY NOT. 

6579
03:29:20,447 --> 03:29:23,684
>>  SO, WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY 

6580
03:29:23,684 --> 03:29:24,852
YOU RETAINED COUNSEL DURING 

6581
03:29:24,852 --> 03:29:27,687

PARKING LOT IN DELAWARE. 

6588
03:29:42,970 --> 03:29:44,772
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE 

6589
03:29:44,772 --> 03:29:45,673
WHOLE SYSTEM WORKS OF 

6590
03:29:45,673 --> 03:29:48,742
INTERVIEWING LAWYERS AND HOW TO 

6591
03:29:48,742 --> 03:29:49,910
PICK ONE, ETCETERA. 

6592
03:29:49,910 --> 03:29:52,279
>>  YOU TESTIFIED EARLIER THAT 

6593
03:29:52,279 --> 03:29:55,482
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE NEED FOR 

6594
03:29:55,482 --> 03:29:55,749
LAWYERS. 

6595
03:29:55,749 --> 03:29:57,284
NOW YOU ARE TRYING TO HIRE 

6596
03:29:57,284 --> 03:29:57,551
THEM. 

6597
03:29:57,551 --> 03:29:59,185
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? 

6598
03:29:59,185 --> 03:30:02,890
>>  IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THE 

6599
03:30:02,890 --> 03:30:05,793
INDIVIDUALS THAT I HAD TOLD, 

6600
03:30:05,793 --> 03:30:07,661
THE TOTAL NUMBER, THE TOTAL WAS 

6601
03:30:07,661 --> 03:30:09,096
NOT VERY HIGH. 

6602
03:30:09,096 --> 03:30:11,298
BUT THOSE PERSONS ADVISED ME TO 

6603
03:30:11,298 --> 03:30:13,600
AT THIS POINT, GET A LAWYER FOR 

6604
03:30:13,600 --> 03:30:15,602
ADVICE ABOUT WHETHER TO PUSH 

6605
03:30:15,602 --> 03:30:16,470

FEINSTEIN? 

6609
03:30:22,443 --> 03:30:22,742
>>  NO. 

6610
03:30:22,742 --> 03:30:28,082
>>  I WANT TO THANK DR. FORD úF 

6611
03:30:28,082 --> 03:30:29,283
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE HAD SAID 

6612
03:30:29,283 --> 03:30:33,887
WE WOULD COME TO CALIFORNIA. 

6613
03:30:33,887 --> 03:30:34,387

POWERFUL AND CREDIBLE AND I 

6619
03:30:51,171 --> 03:30:51,872
BELIEVE YOU. 

6620
03:30:51,872 --> 03:30:53,206
YOU ARE A TEACHER, CORRECT? 

6621
03:30:53,206 --> 03:30:54,040
>>  CORRECT. 

6622
03:30:54,040 --> 03:31:01,582
>>  YOU HAVE GIVEN AMERICA AN 

6623
03:31:01,582 --> 03:31:02,683
AMAZING TEACHING MOMENT AND YOU 

6624
03:31:02,683 --> 03:31:05,586
MAY HAVE OTHER MOMENTS IN THE 

6625
03:31:05,586 --> 03:31:06,987
CLASSROOM, BUT YOU HAVE 

6626
03:31:06,987 --> 03:31:12,926
INSPIRED AND YOU HAVE 

6627
03:31:12,926 --> 03:31:13,393
ENLIGHTENED AMERICA. 

6628
03:31:13,393 --> 03:31:16,230
YOU HAVE INSPIRED AND GIVEN 

6629
03:31:16,230 --> 03:31:17,598
COURAGE TO WOMEN TO COME 

6630
03:31:17,598 --> 03:31:20,434
FORWARD AS THEY HAVE DONE TO 

6631
03:31:20,434 --> 03:31:25,172
EVERY ONE OF OUR OFFICES AND 

6632
03:31:25,172 --> 03:31:26,306
MANY OTHER PUBLIC PLACES. 

6633
03:31:26,306 --> 03:31:34,982
YOU HAVE INSPIRED AND YOU HAVE 

6634
03:31:34,982 --> 03:31:40,988
ENLIGHTENED MEN. 

6635
03:31:40,988 --> 03:31:41,321
IN AMERICA. 

6636
03:31:41,321 --> 03:31:44,224
THAT IS A PROFOUND PUBLIC 

6637
03:31:44,224 --> 03:31:46,927
SERVICE REGARDLESS OF WHAT 

6638
03:31:46,927 --> 03:31:49,229
HAPPENS WITH THIS NOMINATION. 

6639
03:31:49,229 --> 03:31:51,932
AND SO THE TEACHERS OF AMERICA, 

6640
03:31:51,932 --> 03:31:53,333
PEOPLE OF AMERICA SHOULD BE 

6641
03:31:53,333 --> 03:31:55,736
REALLY PROUD OF WHAT YOU HAVE 

6642
03:31:55,736 --> 03:31:55,936

6643
03:31:55,936 --> 03:31:58,472
LET ME TELL YOU WHY I BELIEVE 

6644
03:31:58,472 --> 03:31:58,872
YOU. 

6645
03:31:58,872 --> 03:32:00,974
NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PRIOR 

6646
03:32:00,974 --> 03:32:02,910
CONSISTENT STATEMENTS AND THE 

6647
03:32:02,910 --> 03:32:04,978
POLYGRAPH TEST AND YOUR REQUEST

HEAR FROM OTHER WITNESSES WHO 

6651
03:32:14,621 --> 03:32:18,058
COULD CORROBORATE OR DISPUTE 

6652
03:32:18,058 --> 03:32:18,758
YOUR STORY. 

6653
03:32:18,758 --> 03:32:20,627
BUT ALSO YOU HAD BEEN VERY 

6654
03:32:20,627 --> 03:32:28,135
HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU CANNOT 

6655
03:32:28,135 --> 03:32:29,136
REMEMBER. 

6656
03:32:29,136 --> 03:32:30,804
AND SOMEONE COMPOSING A STORY 

6657
03:32:30,804 --> 03:32:37,377
CAN MAKE IT ALL COME TOGETHER 

6658
03:32:37,377 --> 03:32:39,479
IN A SEAMLESS WAY. 

6659
03:32:39,479 --> 03:32:41,081
SOMEONE WHO IS HONEST, I SPEAK 

6660
03:32:41,081 --> 03:32:47,020
FROM MY EXPERIENCE AS A 

6661
03:32:47,020 --> 03:32:50,924
PROSECUTOR AS WELL, IS ALSO -- 

6662
03:32:50,924 --> 03:32:54,027
ABOUT WHAT HE OR SHE CANNOT 

6663
03:32:54,027 --> 03:32:54,294
REMEMBER. 

6664
03:32:54,294 --> 03:32:55,529
THE SENATORS ON THE OTHER SIDE 

6665
03:32:55,529 --> 03:33:02,236
OF THE AISLE HAVE BEEN SILENT. 

6666
03:33:02,236 --> 03:33:03,904
THIS PROCEDURE IS UNPRECEDENTED 

6667
03:33:03,904 --> 03:33:05,538
IN A CONFIRMATION HEARING. 

6668
03:33:05,538 --> 03:33:11,445
BUT I WANT TO QUOTE ONE OF MY 

6669
03:33:11,445 --> 03:33:12,012
COLLEAGUES, SENATOR LINDSEY 

6670
03:33:12,012 --> 03:33:14,715
GRAHAM, IN A BOOK THAT HE WROTE 

6671
03:33:14,715 --> 03:33:20,554
IN 2015, WHEN HE WAS DESCRIBING 

6672
03:33:20,554 --> 03:33:21,788
HIS OWN SERVICE. 

6673
03:33:21,788 --> 03:33:28,795
VERY DISTINGUISHED SERVICE. 

6674
03:33:28,795 --> 03:33:36,236
I'M NOT UNDER OATH. 

6675
03:33:36,236 --> 03:33:39,306
HE SAID QUOTE, OF HIS 

6676
03:33:39,306 --> 03:33:44,110
PROSECUTIONS OF RAPE CASES, I 

6677
03:33:44,110 --> 03:33:45,412
LEARNED HOW MUCH UNEXPECTED 

6678
03:33:45,412 --> 03:33:48,081
COURAGE FROM A DEEP AND HIDDEN 

6679
03:33:48,081 --> 03:33:50,450
PLACE IT TAKES FOR A RAPE 

6680
03:33:50,450 --> 03:33:53,987
VICTIM OR A SEXUALLY ABUSED 

6681
03:33:53,987 --> 03:33:57,324
CHILD TO TESTIFY AGAINST THEIR 

6682
03:33:57,324 --> 03:33:57,624
ASSAILANT. 

6683
03:33:57,624 --> 03:33:59,059
I LEARNED HOW MUCH COURAGE FROM 

6684
03:33:59,059 --> 03:34:01,128
A DEEP AND HIDDEN PLACE IT 

6685
03:34:01,128 --> 03:34:04,331
TAKES FOR A RAPE VICTIM OR 

6686
03:34:04,331 --> 03:34:06,099
SEXUALLY ABUSED CHILD TO 

6687
03:34:06,099 --> 03:34:07,334
TESTIFY AGAINST THEIR 

6688
03:34:07,334 --> 03:34:07,634
ASSAILANT. 

6689
03:34:07,634 --> 03:34:11,004
IF WE AGREE ON NOTHING ELSE 

6690
03:34:11,004 --> 03:34:14,608
TODAY, I HOPE ON A BIPARTISAN 

6691
03:34:14,608 --> 03:34:17,511
BASIS, WE CAN AGREE ON HOW MUCH 

6692
03:34:17,511 --> 03:34:20,113
COURAGE IT HAS TAKEN FOR YOU TO 

6693
03:34:20,113 --> 03:34:23,016
COME FORWARD AND I THINK YOU 

6694
03:34:23,016 --> 03:34:27,321
HAVE EARNED AMERICA'S 

6695
03:34:27,321 --> 03:34:27,621
GRATITUDE. 

6696
03:34:27,621 --> 03:34:31,725
NOW, THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK 

6697
03:34:31,725 --> 03:34:34,561
ABOUT YOUR REQUESTING AN FBI 

6698
03:34:34,561 --> 03:34:34,928
INVESTIGATION. 

6699
03:34:34,928 --> 03:34:37,064
YOU MENTIONED A POINT JUST A 

6700
03:34:37,064 --> 03:34:44,004
FEW MINUTES AGO THAT YOU COULD 

6701
03:34:44,004 --> 03:34:47,007
BETTER ESTIMATE THE TIME THAT 

6702
03:34:47,007 --> 03:34:49,309
YOU RAN INTO MARK JUDGE IF YOU 

6703
03:34:49,309 --> 03:34:52,713
KNEW THE TIME THAT HE WAS 

6704
03:34:52,713 --> 03:34:53,947
WORKING AT THAT SUPERMARKET. 

6705
03:34:53,947 --> 03:34:55,515
THAT'S A FACT THAT COULD BE 

6706
03:34:55,515 --> 03:35:01,188
UNCOVERED BY AN FBI 

6707
03:35:01,188 --> 03:35:04,024
INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD HELP 

6708
03:35:04,024 --> 03:35:05,125
FURTHER -- YOUR ACCOUNT. 

6709
03:35:05,125 --> 03:35:07,628
WOULD YOU LIKE MARK JUDGE TO BE 

6710
03:35:07,628 --> 03:35:11,031
INTERVIEWED IN CONNECTION WITH 

6711
03:35:11,031 --> 03:35:12,498
THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION 

6712
03:35:12,498 --> 03:35:13,934
AND THE SERIOUS CREDIBLE 

6713
03:35:13,934 --> 03:35:17,737
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU'VE MADE? 

6714
03:35:17,737 --> 03:35:20,107
>>  THAT WOULD BE MY 

6715
03:35:20,107 --> 03:35:20,407
PREFERENCE. 

6716
03:35:20,407 --> 03:35:22,275
I'M NOT SURE IT'S UP TO ME. 

6717
03:35:22,275 --> 03:35:23,610
I CERTAINLY WOULD FEEL LIKE I 

6718
03:35:23,610 --> 03:35:25,412
COULD BE MORE HELPFUL TO 

6719
03:35:25,412 --> 03:35:26,813
EVERYONE IF I KNEW THE DATE 

6720
03:35:26,813 --> 03:35:28,415
THAT HE WORKED AT THE SAFEWAY 

6721
03:35:28,415 --> 03:35:31,018
SO THAT I COULD GIVE A MORE 

6722
03:35:31,018 --> 03:35:32,352
SPECIFIC DATE OF THE ASSAULT. 

6723
03:35:32,352 --> 03:35:33,720
>>  IT'S NOT UP TO YOU. 

6724
03:35:33,720 --> 03:35:36,323
IT'S UP TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

6725
03:35:36,323 --> 03:35:36,690
UNITED STATES. 

6726
03:35:36,690 --> 03:35:38,658
HIS FAILURE TO ASK FOR AN FBI 

6727
03:35:38,658 --> 03:35:42,930
INVESTIGATION, IN MY VIEW, IS A 

6728
03:35:42,930 --> 03:35:43,196
COVERUP. 

6729
03:35:43,196 --> 03:35:48,801
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6730
03:35:48,801 --> 03:35:51,738
>>  SENATOR FLAKE. 

6731
03:35:51,738 --> 03:35:54,007
>>  THANK YOU. 

6732
03:35:54,007 --> 03:35:55,208
WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING 

6733
03:35:55,208 --> 03:35:58,011
SEVERAL TIMES THAT YOU DID TAKE 

6734
03:35:58,011 --> 03:35:58,344
A POLYGRAPH. 

6735
03:35:58,344 --> 03:36:01,248
THAT WAS ON AUGUST 7. IS THAT 

6736
03:36:01,248 --> 03:36:01,481
RIGHT? 

6737
03:36:01,481 --> 03:36:02,882
>>  I BELIEVE SO. 

6738
03:36:02,882 --> 03:36:05,785
THE DAY I WAS FLYING FROM BWI 

6739
03:36:05,785 --> 03:36:06,987
TO MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

6740
03:36:06,987 --> 03:36:09,056
>>  OKAY. 

6741
03:36:09,056 --> 03:36:13,860
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO TAKE A 

6742
03:36:13,860 --> 03:36:14,160
POLYGRAPH? 

6743
03:36:14,160 --> 03:36:16,863
>>  I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON NOT 

6744
03:36:16,863 --> 03:36:17,130
TO DO IT. 

6745
03:36:17,130 --> 03:36:21,468
>>  WERE YOU ADVISED TO DO 

6746
03:36:21,468 --> 03:36:21,735
THAT? 

6747
03:36:21,735 --> 03:36:24,404
>>  AGAIN, YOU ARE SEEMING TO 

6748
03:36:24,404 --> 03:36:25,572
CALL FOR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN 

6749
03:36:25,572 --> 03:36:26,339
COUNSEL AND CLIENT. 

6750
03:36:26,339 --> 03:36:28,008
I DON'T THINK YOU MEAN TO DO 

6751
03:36:28,008 --> 03:36:28,241
THAT. 

6752
03:36:28,241 --> 03:36:31,411
IF YOU DO, SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE 

6753
03:36:31,411 --> 03:36:32,546
TO ANSWER THAT. 

6754
03:36:32,546 --> 03:36:34,915
>>  CONSOLE, COULD YOU LET HER 

6755
03:36:34,915 --> 03:36:39,519
ANSWER THE EXTENT TO WHICH 

6756
03:36:39,519 --> 03:36:41,855
DOESN'T VIOLATE THE 

6757
03:36:41,855 --> 03:36:50,530
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND 

6758
03:36:50,530 --> 03:36:53,433
DR. FORD. 

6759
03:36:53,433 --> 03:37:05,212
>>  BASED ON THE ADVICE OF THE 

6760
03:37:05,212 --> 03:37:08,148
COUNSEL, I WAS HAPPY TO UNDERGO 

6761
03:37:08,148 --> 03:37:09,649
THE POLYGRAPH TEST, ALTHOUGH I 

6762
03:37:09,649 --> 03:37:13,120
FOUND IT EXTREMELY STRESSFUL. 

6763
03:37:13,120 --> 03:37:16,022
MUCH LONGER THAN I ANTICIPATED. 

6764
03:37:16,022 --> 03:37:19,626
I TOLD MY WHOLE LIFE STORY, I 

6765
03:37:19,626 --> 03:37:19,926
FELT LIKE. 

6766
03:37:19,926 --> 03:37:20,894
I ENDURED IT. 

6767
03:37:20,894 --> 03:37:22,062
IT WAS FINE. 

6768
03:37:22,062 --> 03:37:24,364
>>  I UNDERSTAND THEY CAN BE 

6769
03:37:24,364 --> 03:37:24,630
THAT WAY. 

6770
03:37:24,630 --> 03:37:26,666
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN ANY OTHER 

6771
03:37:26,666 --> 03:37:27,667
POLYGRAPHS IN YOUR LIFE? 

6772
03:37:27,667 --> 03:37:28,601
>>  NEVER. 

6773
03:37:28,601 --> 03:37:30,937
>>  OKAY. 

6774
03:37:30,937 --> 03:37:34,241
YOU WENT TO SEE A GENTLEMAN BY 

6775
03:37:34,241 --> 03:37:37,244
THE NAME OF JEREMIAH TO SERVE 

6776
03:37:37,244 --> 03:37:45,351
AS THE PA LIG PALIGRAPHER. 

6777
03:37:45,351 --> 03:37:47,153
DID ANYONE ADVISE YOU ON THAT 

6778
03:37:47,153 --> 03:37:47,420
CHOICE? 

6779
03:37:47,420 --> 03:37:48,254
>>  YES. 

6780
03:37:48,254 --> 03:37:51,124
I BELIEVE HIS NAME WAS JERRY. 

6781
03:37:51,124 --> 03:37:53,259
>>  JERRY HANAFEN. 

6782
03:37:53,259 --> 03:37:54,361
>>  YES. 

6783
03:37:54,361 --> 03:37:58,298
DID ANYONE ADVISE YOU ON THAT 

6784
03:37:58,298 --> 03:37:58,565
CHOICE? 

6785
03:37:58,565 --> 03:38:01,968
>>  YEAH, I DIDN'T CHOOSE HIM 

6786
03:38:01,968 --> 03:38:02,201
MYSELF. 

6787
03:38:02,201 --> 03:38:04,738
HE WAS THE PERSON THAT CAME TO 

6788
03:38:04,738 --> 03:38:05,438
DO THE POLYGRAPH TEST. 

6789
03:38:05,438 --> 03:38:08,542
>>  HE ACTUALLY CONDUCTED THE 

6790
03:38:08,542 --> 03:38:09,976
POLYGRAPH NOT IN HIS OFFICE IN 

6791
03:38:09,976 --> 03:38:13,747
VIRGINIA, BUT ACTUALLY AT THE 

6792
03:38:13,747 --> 03:38:15,916
HOTEL NEXT TO BALTIMORE 

6793
03:38:15,916 --> 03:38:16,349
WASHINGTON AIRPORT. 

6794
03:38:16,349 --> 03:38:17,416
IS THAT CORRECT? 

6795
03:38:17,416 --> 03:38:18,117
>>  CORRECT. 

6796
03:38:18,117 --> 03:38:20,353
>>  WHY WAS THAT LOCATION MADE? 

6797
03:38:20,353 --> 03:38:24,290
>>  I HAD LEFT MY GRANDMOTHER'S 

6798
03:38:24,290 --> 03:38:26,293
FUNERAL THAT DAY AND WAS ON 

6799
03:38:26,293 --> 03:38:28,461
TIGHT SCHEDULE TO GET A PLANE 

6800
03:38:28,461 --> 03:38:29,462
TO MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

6801
03:38:29,462 --> 03:38:31,565
SO HE WAS WILLING TO COME TO 

6802
03:38:31,565 --> 03:38:32,699
ME, WHICH WAS APPRECIATED. 

6803
03:38:32,699 --> 03:38:34,968
>>  SO HE ADMINISTERED A 

6804
03:38:34,968 --> 03:38:37,037
POLYGRAPH ON THE DAY THAT YOU 

6805
03:38:37,037 --> 03:38:38,572
ATTENDED YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S 

6806
03:38:38,572 --> 03:38:38,839
FUNERAL? 

6807
03:38:38,839 --> 03:38:40,106
>>  CORRECT. 

6808
03:38:40,106 --> 03:38:41,441
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NEXT 

6809
03:38:41,441 --> 03:38:41,641
DAY. 

6810
03:38:41,641 --> 03:38:46,146
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN A HOTEL. 

6811
03:38:46,146 --> 03:38:50,884
I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT DAY. 

6812
03:38:50,884 --> 03:38:56,289
>>  HAVE YOU EVER HAD 

6813
03:38:56,289 --> 03:38:58,191
DISCUSSIONS WITH ANYONE BESIDES 

6814
03:38:58,191 --> 03:39:01,861
YOUR ATTORNEYS ON HOW TO TAKE A 

6815
03:39:01,861 --> 03:39:02,161
POLYGRAPH? 

6816
03:39:02,161 --> 03:39:02,528
>>  NEVER. 

6817
03:39:02,528 --> 03:39:06,199
>>  I DON'T JUST MEAN 

6818
03:39:06,199 --> 03:39:07,267
COUNTERMEASURES, BUT I MEAN 

6819
03:39:07,267 --> 03:39:10,437
JUST ANY SORT OF TIPS OR 

6820
03:39:10,437 --> 03:39:10,970
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 

6821
03:39:10,970 --> 03:39:13,306
>>  NO. 

6822
03:39:13,306 --> 03:39:15,742
I WAS SCARED OF THE TEST 

6823
03:39:15,742 --> 03:39:18,678
ITSELF, BUT WAS COMFORTABLE 

6824
03:39:18,678 --> 03:39:21,047
THAT I COULD TELL THE 

6825
03:39:21,047 --> 03:39:22,883
INFORMATION AND THE TEST WOULD 

6826
03:39:22,883 --> 03:39:24,751
REVEAL WHATEVER IT WAS GOING TO 

6827
03:39:24,751 --> 03:39:24,984
REVEAL. 

6828
03:39:24,984 --> 03:39:26,152
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE AS 

6829
03:39:26,152 --> 03:39:27,754
LONG AS IT WAS GOING TO BE. 

6830
03:39:27,754 --> 03:39:29,121
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT STRESSFUL. 

6831
03:39:29,121 --> 03:39:31,925
>>  HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN TIPS OR 

6832
03:39:31,925 --> 03:39:32,926
ADVICE TO SOMEONE WHO WAS 

6833
03:39:32,926 --> 03:39:34,394
LOOKING TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH 

6834
03:39:34,394 --> 03:39:35,028
TEST? 

6835
03:39:35,028 --> 03:39:35,728
>>  NEVER. 

6836
03:39:35,728 --> 03:39:37,197
>>  OKAY. 

6837
03:39:37,197 --> 03:39:41,534
DID YOU PAY FOR THE POLYGRAPH 

6838
03:39:41,534 --> 03:39:41,801
YOURSELF? 

6839
03:39:41,801 --> 03:39:43,503
>>  I DON'T THINK SO. 

6840
03:39:43,503 --> 03:39:45,671
>>  DO YOU KNOW WHO DID PAY FOR 

6841
03:39:45,671 --> 03:39:46,072
THE POLYGRAPH? 

6842
03:39:46,072 --> 03:39:53,746
>>  NOT YET, NO.

6843
03:39:53,746 --> 03:39:57,050
>>  YOU HAVE THE HANDWRITTEN 

6844
03:39:57,050 --> 03:39:59,586
STATEMENT THAT YOU WROTE OUT. 

6845
03:39:59,586 --> 03:40:03,323
DID ANYONE ASSIST YOU IN 

6846
03:40:03,323 --> 03:40:03,823
WRITING THAT STATEMENT? 

6847
03:40:03,823 --> 03:40:04,590
>>  NO. 

6848
03:40:04,590 --> 03:40:07,527
YOU CAN TELL HOW ANXIOUS I WAS 

6849
03:40:07,527 --> 03:40:13,332
BY THE TERRIBLE HANDWRITING. 

6850
03:40:13,332 --> 03:40:17,504
>>  DID YOU -- WE TOUCHED ON IT 

6851
03:40:17,504 --> 03:40:17,771
EARLIER. 

6852
03:40:17,771 --> 03:40:20,206
DID YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE 

6853
03:40:20,206 --> 03:40:21,408
REQUESTED NOT ONLY THE CHART 

6854
03:40:21,408 --> 03:40:23,777
FROM THE POLYGRAPH TEST, BUT 

6855
03:40:23,777 --> 03:40:25,879
ALSO ANY AUDIO OR VIDEO 

6856
03:40:25,879 --> 03:40:28,682
RECORDING OF THE POLYGRAPH 

6857
03:40:28,682 --> 03:40:29,649
TEST. 

6858
03:40:29,649 --> 03:40:29,949
>>  NO. 

6859
03:40:29,949 --> 03:40:31,985
>>  WERE YOU AUDIO AND VIDEO 

6860
03:40:31,985 --> 03:40:34,187
RECORDED WHEN YOU WERE TAKING 

6861
03:40:34,187 --> 03:40:35,054
THAT TEST? 

6862
03:40:35,054 --> 03:40:36,423
>>  OKAY. 

6863
03:40:36,423 --> 03:40:39,025
I REMEMBER BEING HOOKED UP TO A 

6864
03:40:39,025 --> 03:40:42,529
MACHINE, LIKE BEING PLACED ON 

6865
03:40:42,529 --> 03:40:45,699
TO MY BODY AND BEING ASKED A 

6866
03:40:45,699 --> 03:40:49,102
LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CRYING A 

6867
03:40:49,102 --> 03:40:49,502
LOT. 

6868
03:40:49,502 --> 03:40:52,105
THAT'S MY PRIMARY MEMORY OF 

6869
03:40:52,105 --> 03:40:53,573
THAT TEST. 

6870
03:40:53,573 --> 03:40:54,974
I KNOW HE TOOK DETAIL INTO 

6871
03:40:54,974 --> 03:40:57,577
EXPLANING WHAT HE WAS GOING TO 

6872
03:40:57,577 --> 03:40:59,979
BE DOING, BUT I WAS JUST 

6873
03:40:59,979 --> 03:41:01,548
FOCUSED ON WHAT I WAS GOING TO 

6874
03:41:01,548 --> 03:41:03,983
SAY AND MY FEAR ABOUT THAT. 

6875
03:41:03,983 --> 03:41:05,285
I WASN'T LISTENING TO EVERY 

6876
03:41:05,285 --> 03:41:07,020
DETAIL ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS 

6877
03:41:07,020 --> 03:41:07,988
AUDIO OR VIDEO RECORDED. 

6878
03:41:07,988 --> 03:41:09,855
>>  YOU WERE IN A HOTEL ROOM, 

6879
03:41:09,855 --> 03:41:10,390
RIGHT? 

6880
03:41:10,390 --> 03:41:10,789
>>  CORRECT. 

6881
03:41:10,789 --> 03:41:13,526
>>  REGULAR HOTEL ROOM WITH A 

6882
03:41:13,526 --> 03:41:13,926
BED AND BATHROOM? 

6883
03:41:13,926 --> 03:41:14,728
>>  NO. 

6884
03:41:14,728 --> 03:41:16,129
IT WAS A CONFERENCE ROOM. 

6885
03:41:16,129 --> 03:41:18,298
I WAS SITTING AT A CHAIR AND HE 

6886
03:41:18,298 --> 03:41:18,665
WAS BEHIND ME. 

6887
03:41:18,665 --> 03:41:22,201
>>  DID YOU NOTE ANY CAMERAS IN 

6888
03:41:22,201 --> 03:41:22,468
THE ROOM? 

6889
03:41:22,468 --> 03:41:24,670
>>  HE HAD A COMPUTER SET UP. 

6890
03:41:24,670 --> 03:41:27,707
SO I GUESS I ASSUME HE WAS 

6891
03:41:27,707 --> 03:41:28,942
SOMEHOW TAPING AND RECORDING 

6892
03:41:28,942 --> 03:41:29,175
ME. 

6893
03:41:29,175 --> 03:41:30,410
>>  OKAY. 

6894
03:41:30,410 --> 03:41:32,612
SO YOU ASSUMED YOU WERE BEING 

6895
03:41:32,612 --> 03:41:33,145
VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDED. 

6896
03:41:33,145 --> 03:41:34,079
>>  CORRECT. 

6897
03:41:34,079 --> 03:41:35,414
>>  BUT YOU DON'T KNOW FOR 

6898
03:41:35,414 --> 03:41:35,615
SURE. 

6899
03:41:35,615 --> 03:41:36,983
>>  I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. 

6900
03:41:36,983 --> 03:41:37,584
>>  OKAY. 

6901
03:41:37,584 --> 03:41:37,884
THANK YOU. 

6902
03:41:37,884 --> 03:41:40,887
>>  WE'RE GOING TO RECESS NOW 

6903
03:41:40,887 --> 03:41:46,592

6904
03:41:46,592 --> 03:41:52,632
THANK YOU DR. FORD.

6914

CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD HAS BEEN

03:42:07,446 --> 03:42:08,915
TESTIFYING FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS 

6916
03:42:08,915 --> 03:42:10,250

THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS. 

6923
03:42:21,194 --> 03:42:23,663
RACHEL MITCHELL IS QUESTIONING 

6924
03:42:23,663 --> 03:42:24,030
THE WITNESS. 

6925
03:42:24,030 --> 03:42:25,832
BLASEY FORD TESTIFIED SHE IS 

6926
03:42:25,832 --> 03:42:28,334
100% SURE AND SHE SAID THAT A 

6927
03:42:28,334 --> 03:42:28,968
COUPLE TIMES. 

6928
03:42:28,968 --> 03:42:32,305
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH ATTACKED 

6929
03:42:32,305 --> 03:42:32,505

TABLE. 

6932
03:42:34,473 --> 03:42:35,407
WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU FIRST? 

6933
03:42:35,407 --> 03:42:38,344
>>  IT'S BEEN THE CONTINUOUS 

6934
03:42:38,344 --> 03:42:39,946
SWING, GAYLE, BETWEEN THESE BIG 

6935
03:42:39,946 --> 03:42:40,580
EMOTIONAL SWEEPING STATEMENTS 

6936
03:42:40,580 --> 03:42:42,215
WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE 

6937
03:42:42,215 --> 03:42:43,817
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND THEN

RACHEL MITCHELL QUESTIONING ON 

6939
03:42:44,918 --> 03:42:50,156
BEHALF OF THE REPUBLICANS IN 

6940
03:42:50,156 --> 03:42:51,858
THIS VERY MICROLEVEL STEP BY 

6941
03:42:51,858 --> 03:42:54,561
STEP, ALMOST A STERILE SORT OF 

6942
03:42:54,561 --> 03:42:54,894
QUESTIONING. 

6943
03:42:54,894 --> 03:42:56,095
THAT CONTINUES TO BE, I THINK, 

6944
03:42:56,095 --> 03:42:57,396
ONE OF THE BIG THEMES HERE. 

6945
03:42:57,396 --> 03:42:58,531
THE OTHER ONE THAT IS 

6946
03:42:58,531 --> 03:43:00,066
DEVELOPING, YOU ARE HEARING, 

6947
03:43:00,066 --> 03:43:02,669

MARK JUDGE. 

6951
03:43:07,306 --> 03:43:07,940
WHERE IS MARK JUDGE? 

6952
03:43:07,940 --> 03:43:10,243
>>  RACHEL MICHELLE APPEARS TO 

6953
03:43:10,243 --> 03:43:12,011
BE TRYING TO GO SOMEWHERE. 

6954
03:43:12,011 --> 03:43:14,647
I'M NOT SURE WHERE SHE'S GOING. 

6955
03:43:14,647 --> 03:43:17,016
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER DEMEANOR, 

6956
03:43:17,016 --> 03:43:18,718
DR. FORD'S DEMEANOR, HER TONE, 

6957
03:43:18,718 --> 03:43:20,520
HER DEMEANOR SEEMS TO BE, HOW 

6958
03:43:20,520 --> 03:43:21,020
CAN I HELP? 

6959
03:43:21,020 --> 03:43:23,022
WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME? 

6960
03:43:23,022 --> 03:43:25,258
THERE'S NOTHING EVASIVE ABOUT 

6961
03:43:25,258 --> 03:43:25,625
HER TESTIMONY. 

6962
03:43:25,625 --> 03:43:26,960
SHE WANTED AN FBI 

6963
03:43:26,960 --> 03:43:28,561
INVESTIGATION, LAST TIME I 

6964
03:43:28,561 --> 03:43:29,362
CHECKED, ANYBODY WHO HAS 

6965
03:43:29,362 --> 03:43:31,030
SOMETHING TO HIDE IS NO THE 

6966
03:43:31,030 --> 03:43:32,198
ASKING FOR AN FBI 

6967
03:43:32,198 --> 03:43:32,565
INVESTIGATION. 

6968
03:43:32,565 --> 03:43:34,367
>>  AND IT GOES TO THE NATURE 

6969
03:43:34,367 --> 03:43:36,669
OF THE WAY THEY HAVE OUTLINED 

6970
03:43:36,669 --> 03:43:37,136
THIS WHOLE PROCESS. 

6971
03:43:37,136 --> 03:43:39,539
THEY HAVE HER DO IT IN THESE 

6972
03:43:39,539 --> 03:43:40,539
FIVE MINUTE INCRIMINATES. 

6973
03:43:40,539 --> 03:43:42,509
YOU FEEL LIKE SHE'S DOING A 

6974
03:43:42,509 --> 03:43:44,811
WITNESS INTERVIEW AS OPPOSED TO 

6975
03:43:44,811 --> 03:43:46,446
CROSS EXAMINING SOMEONE IN A 

6976
03:43:46,446 --> 03:43:48,615
COURTROOM AND ASKING FOR FACTS 

6977
03:43:48,615 --> 03:43:49,716
AND TRYING TO FLUSH OUT THE 

6978
03:43:49,716 --> 03:43:53,419
FACTS OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT 

6979
03:43:53,419 --> 03:43:53,720
DAY. 

6980
03:43:53,720 --> 03:43:55,855
SHE GETS ALONG A LINE OF 

6981
03:43:55,855 --> 03:43:56,556
QUESTIONING, THE FIVE MINUTES 

6982
03:43:56,556 --> 03:43:58,157
ARE UP AND IT GOES ELSEWHERE. 

6983
03:43:58,157 --> 03:43:59,259
IT'S HARD TO SEE WHERE SHE MAY 

6984
03:43:59,259 --> 03:44:02,161
BE GOING WITH THIS. 

6985
03:44:02,161 --> 03:44:04,129
MAYBE THIS IS KIND OF FLUSHING 

6986
03:44:04,129 --> 03:44:05,365
OUT SOME OF THE RECORD TO 

6987
03:44:05,365 --> 03:44:06,766
SUGGEST, I DO THINK THEY ARE 

6988
03:44:06,766 --> 03:44:09,502
LAYING SOME OF HER QUESTIONS. 

6989
03:44:09,502 --> 03:44:10,402
SHE'S LAYING GROUNDWORK. 

6990
03:44:10,402 --> 03:44:13,540
EVEN THOUGH SHE SAYS SHE IS 

6991
03:44:13,540 --> 03:44:13,840
100% SURE. 

6992
03:44:13,840 --> 03:44:15,642
IT IS POSSIBLE SHE DID 

6993
03:44:15,642 --> 03:44:17,644
MISREMEMBER THIS EVENT AND MAY 

6994
03:44:17,644 --> 03:44:18,544
BE OTHER WITNESSES. 

6995
03:44:18,544 --> 03:44:19,412
YOU SAW HER CONTRADICT THE 

6996
03:44:19,412 --> 03:44:20,946
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AT THE PARTY. 

6997
03:44:20,946 --> 03:44:22,215
SOME OF THE STATEMENTS SHE GAVE 

6998
03:44:22,215 --> 03:44:23,850
TO THE WASHINGTON POST ARE 

6999
03:44:23,850 --> 03:44:24,150
DIFFERENT. 

7000
03:44:24,150 --> 03:44:25,418
AND SUGGESTING SHE CAME FORWARD 

7001
03:44:25,418 --> 03:44:26,252
EARLY ON, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T 

7002
03:44:26,252 --> 03:44:28,621
WANT HIM TO BE THE NOMINEE. 

7003
03:44:28,621 --> 03:44:29,121
AND THEN DEMOCRATS -- 

7004
03:44:29,121 --> 03:44:30,656
>>  WHEN HE WAS ON THE SHORT 

7005
03:44:30,656 --> 03:44:30,857
LIST. 

7006
03:44:30,857 --> 03:44:35,028
>>  AND YOU SEE THIS, DEMOCRATS 

7007
03:44:35,028 --> 03:44:36,362
SAID ON THAT TO MANIPULATE HER. 

7008
03:44:36,362 --> 03:44:38,364
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE 

7009
03:44:38,364 --> 03:44:38,597
SEEING. 

7010
03:44:38,597 --> 03:44:39,566
IT'S HARD TO SEE WHERE SHE'S 

7011
03:44:39,566 --> 03:44:40,733
GOING WITH SOME OF THIS. 

7012
03:44:40,733 --> 03:44:42,368
>>  NORA HAS BEEN LEADING OUR 

7013
03:44:42,368 --> 03:44:43,670
COVERAGE FROM CAPITOL HILL. 

7014
03:44:43,670 --> 03:44:46,940
NORA, WHAT IS YOUR BIG TAKE 

7015
03:44:46,940 --> 03:44:47,941
AWAY FROM THIS SECOND ROUND OF 

7016
03:44:47,941 --> 03:44:48,241
TESTIMONY? 

7017
03:44:48,241 --> 03:44:50,443
>>  TO FOLLOW OEN WHAT JAN IS 

7018
03:44:50,443 --> 03:44:52,045
TALKING ABOUT, I THINK WHAT YOU 

7019
03:44:52,045 --> 03:44:54,547
SEE IS THE GENTLE, BUT POINTED 

7020
03:44:54,547 --> 03:44:56,149
QUESTIONING FROM THE SPECIAL 

7021
03:44:56,149 --> 03:44:57,150
PROSECUTOR WHO IS REPRESENTING 

7022
03:44:57,150 --> 03:44:57,650
THE REPUBLICAN. 

7023
03:44:57,650 --> 03:45:00,453
I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE IS IN 

7024
03:45:00,453 --> 03:45:02,455
DOUBT, BUT ASKING MORE SPECIFIC 

7025
03:45:02,455 --> 03:45:04,057
QUESTIONING THAT GO TO THIS 

7026
03:45:04,057 --> 03:45:04,723
QUESTION OF CREDIBILITY. 

7027
03:45:04,723 --> 03:45:05,592
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN 

7028
03:45:05,592 --> 03:45:07,460
TALKING FROM THE VERY 

7029
03:45:07,460 --> 03:45:07,760
BEGINNING. 

7030
03:45:07,760 --> 03:45:08,394
SPECIFICALLY, SHE ASKED THE 

7031
03:45:08,394 --> 03:45:10,196
QUESTION ABOUT THE THERAPIST 

7032
03:45:10,196 --> 03:45:10,463
NOTES. 

7033
03:45:10,463 --> 03:45:13,366
REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST 

7034
03:45:13,366 --> 03:45:14,267
CORROBORATING ACCOUNT WAS THAT 

7035
03:45:14,267 --> 03:45:16,535
SHE TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH HER 

7036
03:45:16,535 --> 03:45:18,738
THERAPIST IN 2012 WHEN SHE WENT 

7037
03:45:18,738 --> 03:45:19,338
FOR MARRIAGE COUNSELING. 

7038
03:45:19,338 --> 03:45:21,941
SO THE QUESTION WAS, DID YOU 

7039
03:45:21,941 --> 03:45:23,876
NAME BRETT KAVANAUGH THEN IN 

7040
03:45:23,876 --> 03:45:24,143
2012? 

7041
03:45:24,143 --> 03:45:25,010
SHE SAID NO. 

7042
03:45:25,010 --> 03:45:26,946
WHEN SHE TOLD HER HUSBAND, 

7043
03:45:26,946 --> 03:45:28,848
BEFORE THEY WERE MARRIED THAT 

7044
03:45:28,848 --> 03:45:29,849
SHE EXPERIENCED A SEXUAL 

7045
03:45:29,849 --> 03:45:31,818
ASSAULT, DID SHE TELL HER 

7046
03:45:31,818 --> 03:45:32,719
HUSBAND AT THE TIME THE NAME, 

7047
03:45:32,719 --> 03:45:34,987
THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON, NO. 

7048
03:45:34,987 --> 03:45:36,355
JUST A QUESTION. 

7049
03:45:36,355 --> 03:45:37,890
WHY, WHY NOT? 

7050
03:45:37,890 --> 03:45:40,493
WHY DIDN'T SHE NAME HIS NAME? 

7051
03:45:40,493 --> 03:45:41,794
SHE'S JUST GETTING TO THAT. 

7052
03:45:41,794 --> 03:45:44,797
A QUESTION TO RAISE WHAT MAY BE 

7053
03:45:44,797 --> 03:45:46,799
DOUBTS TO ADD TO THE STORY LINE 

7054
03:45:46,799 --> 03:45:47,700
THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. 

7055
03:45:47,700 --> 03:45:49,569
THE OTHER QUESTION I THINK THAT 

7056
03:45:49,569 --> 03:45:51,004
I WAS LOOKING BACK CLOSELY, THE 

7057
03:45:51,004 --> 03:45:52,271
QUESTION OF THE MAP. 

7058
03:45:52,271 --> 03:45:54,674
WHY POINT OUT THE DISTANCE 

7059
03:45:54,674 --> 03:45:55,541
BETWEEN COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB, 

7060
03:45:55,541 --> 03:45:59,646
WHERE THE HOUSE WAS, AND WHERE 

7061
03:45:59,646 --> 03:46:00,913
CHRISTINE BLASEY LIVED WHEN SHE 

7062
03:46:00,913 --> 03:46:02,982
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

7063
03:46:02,982 --> 03:46:05,652
THE MAP SHOWED ESSENTIALLY A 

7064
03:46:05,652 --> 03:46:05,919
DISTANCE. 

7065
03:46:05,919 --> 03:46:06,753
IT'S ABOUT 8.2 MILES BETWEEN 

7066
03:46:06,753 --> 03:46:09,689
HER HOUSE AND COLUMBIA COUNTRY 

7067
03:46:09,689 --> 03:46:09,889
CLUB. 

7068
03:46:09,889 --> 03:46:10,890
IT'S ABOUT 6.2 MILES BETWEEN 

7069
03:46:10,890 --> 03:46:13,993
HER HOUSE AND WHERE THIS 

7070
03:46:13,993 --> 03:46:15,027
ALLEGED ASSAULT TOOK PLACE. 

7071
03:46:15,027 --> 03:46:17,096
AFTER YOU ARE ASSAULTED, HOW 

7072
03:46:17,096 --> 03:46:17,797
DID YOU GET HOME? 

7073
03:46:17,797 --> 03:46:19,498
WOULD YOU HAVE REMEMBERED THAT? 

7074
03:46:19,498 --> 03:46:22,368
WHY DIDN'T YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU 

7075
03:46:22,368 --> 03:46:22,635
GOT HOME? 

7076
03:46:22,635 --> 03:46:22,901
YOU KNOW. 

7077
03:46:22,901 --> 03:46:24,470
THAT KIND OF LINE OF 

7078
03:46:24,470 --> 03:46:25,471
QUESTIONING, IT'S JUST ADDING 

7079
03:46:25,471 --> 03:46:27,407
TO THIS STORY LINE ABOUT 

7080
03:46:27,407 --> 03:46:28,808
REMEMBERING THAT EVENT. 

7081
03:46:28,808 --> 03:46:30,476
I THINK SHE'S JUST, LIKE YOU 

7082
03:46:30,476 --> 03:46:32,679
GUYS SAID, IT'S HARD TO SEE 

7083
03:46:32,679 --> 03:46:34,380
WHERE THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS 

7084
03:46:34,380 --> 03:46:36,149
GOING, EXCEPT SHE SEEMS TO BE 

7085
03:46:36,149 --> 03:46:37,550
SLOWLY TRYING TO STITCH 

7086
03:46:37,550 --> 03:46:37,983
SOMETHING TOGETHER. 

7087
03:46:37,983 --> 03:46:39,752
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS IT OR 

7088
03:46:39,752 --> 03:46:43,789
IS IT JUST KNICKS IN HER 

7089
03:46:43,789 --> 03:46:44,123
CREDIBILITY? 

7090
03:46:44,123 --> 03:46:46,225
>>  ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT 

7091
03:46:46,225 --> 03:46:49,095
EACH TIME AS NORA OUTLINED, 

7092
03:46:49,095 --> 03:46:52,198
SOME QUESTIONING HAVE BEEN 

7093
03:46:52,198 --> 03:46:54,500
ASKED, IS THEN INTERRUPTED BY 

7094
03:46:54,500 --> 03:46:55,468
CHARACTER WITNESSES BY THE 

7095
03:46:55,468 --> 03:46:56,769
DEMOCRATS AND THE VERY 

7096
03:46:56,769 --> 03:46:57,637
TESTIMONY OF DR. FORD HERSELF. 

7097
03:46:57,637 --> 03:46:58,771
AND SO IF SOMEBODY IS WEIGHING 

7098
03:46:58,771 --> 03:47:00,573
IN THIS THE COURT OF PUBLIC 

7099
03:47:00,573 --> 03:47:02,342
OPINION, THIS IS NOT A COURT. 

7100
03:47:02,342 --> 03:47:03,842
IT'S A POLITICAL EVENT. 

7101
03:47:03,842 --> 03:47:05,011
THEY ARE SEEING ANSWERS BY A 

7102
03:47:05,011 --> 03:47:06,979
WITNESS WHO IS TRYING TO BE 

7103
03:47:06,979 --> 03:47:08,648
VERY SPECIFIC, EVEN THE 

7104
03:47:08,648 --> 03:47:10,583
ADJECTIVES, SHE IS TRYING TO BE 

7105
03:47:10,583 --> 03:47:12,118
HELPFUL, AS YOU SAID, GAYLE, 

7106
03:47:12,118 --> 03:47:14,053
AND THAT IS BEING WEIGHED 

7107
03:47:14,053 --> 03:47:16,723
AGAINST SMALL QUESTIONS HERE 

7108
03:47:16,723 --> 03:47:19,025
AND THERE. 

7109
03:47:19,025 --> 03:47:19,726
THERE IS CONTEMPORANEOUS 

7110
03:47:19,726 --> 03:47:21,494
READINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE 

7111
03:47:21,494 --> 03:47:22,928
ABOUT HER CHARACTER AS OPPOSED 

7112
03:47:22,928 --> 03:47:24,063
TO DOUBTS THAT MIGHT HAVE 

7113
03:47:24,063 --> 03:47:24,330
HAPPENED. 

7114
03:47:24,330 --> 03:47:25,798
>>  THEY ARE TRYING TO CONDUCT 

7115
03:47:25,798 --> 03:47:28,701
A LEGAL AND POLITICAL EVENT AT 

7116
03:47:28,701 --> 03:47:29,068
THE SAME TIME. 

7117
03:47:29,068 --> 03:47:30,770
IT'S WORTH, AS YOU GUYS HAVE 

7118
03:47:30,770 --> 03:47:32,805
MENTIONED, IT'S WORTH ASKING 

7119
03:47:32,805 --> 03:47:33,806
THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE MAY 

7120
03:47:33,806 --> 03:47:36,408
NOT BE THIS AH-HA MOMENT. 

7121
03:47:36,408 --> 03:47:37,142
SHE IS DELIBERATELY GOING 

7122
03:47:37,142 --> 03:47:38,611
THROUGH ALL OF THIS. 

7123
03:47:38,611 --> 03:47:40,279
I THINK THERE'S AN EXPECTATION 

7124
03:47:40,279 --> 03:47:42,582
SOME HAVE THAT SHE'S TRYING TO 

7125
03:47:42,582 --> 03:47:43,482
REACH SOME CRESCENDO. 

7126
03:47:43,482 --> 03:47:45,785
I THINK IT'S WORTH ASKING THE 

7127
03:47:45,785 --> 03:47:47,186
QUESTION OF WHETHER SHE'LL 

7128
03:47:47,186 --> 03:47:50,022
CONTINUE ALONG AT THIS PACE TO 

7129
03:47:50,022 --> 03:47:51,324
ASK THESE QUESTIONS OF 

7130
03:47:51,324 --> 03:47:51,824
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 

7131
03:47:51,824 --> 03:47:53,926
>>  THE MORE YOU HEAR DR. FORD 

7132
03:47:53,926 --> 03:47:55,328
SPEAK, THE MORE YOU THINK THAT 

7133
03:47:55,328 --> 03:47:57,530
SHE IS DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN 

7134
03:47:57,530 --> 03:47:58,130
TO HELP. 

7135
03:47:58,130 --> 03:48:00,098
SHE'S NOT BEING EVASIVE. 

7136
03:48:00,098 --> 03:48:01,500
SHE'S SIMPLE ABOUT HER PROCESS. 

7137
03:48:01,500 --> 03:48:02,768
SHE SAID ALL ALONG. 

7138
03:48:02,768 --> 03:48:05,505
I JUST WANTED TO DO MY CIVIC 

7139
03:48:05,505 --> 03:48:05,705
DUTY. 

7140
03:48:05,705 --> 03:48:07,006
SHE TALKS ABOUT HER BEACH 

7141
03:48:07,006 --> 03:48:08,508
FRIENDS WHO GAVE HER ADVICE TO 

7142
03:48:08,508 --> 03:48:10,510
GET THIS INTO THE PUBLIC 

7143
03:48:10,510 --> 03:48:10,810
ATMOSPHERE. 

7144
03:48:10,810 --> 03:48:12,512
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE 

7145
03:48:12,512 --> 03:48:12,745
MEDIA. 

7146
03:48:12,745 --> 03:48:13,613
HER BEACH FRIENDS SUGGESTED 

7147
03:48:13,613 --> 03:48:15,214
THAT YOU GO TO YOUR 

7148
03:48:15,214 --> 03:48:15,581
CONGRESSWOMAN. 

7149
03:48:15,581 --> 03:48:16,515
YOU GO TO YOUR CONGRESSPERSON 

7150
03:48:16,515 --> 03:48:17,884
AND GET IT OUT THAT WAY. 

7151
03:48:17,884 --> 03:48:19,485
AND THEN AFTER SHE WENT TO HER 

7152
03:48:19,485 --> 03:48:20,753
BEACH FRIENDS, SHE IS SITTING 

7153
03:48:20,753 --> 03:48:25,057
IN A PARKING LOT IN  WALGREEN'S 

7154
03:48:25,057 --> 03:48:26,558
TRYING TO PICK A LAWYER. 

7155
03:48:26,558 --> 03:48:28,027
THERE WAS NOTHING SOPHISTICATED 

7156
03:48:28,027 --> 03:48:29,462
OR STRATEGIC IN HOW SHE WAS 

7157
03:48:29,462 --> 03:48:31,363
TRYING TO GET THIS TO THE 

7158
03:48:31,363 --> 03:48:31,730
PUBLIC DOMAIN. 

7159
03:48:31,730 --> 03:48:34,133
>>  AND I THINK WHEN YOU THINK 

7160
03:48:34,133 --> 03:48:36,235
ABOUT KIND OF SOME OF THE 

7161
03:48:36,235 --> 03:48:38,604
THINGS THAT NORA LAYED OUT, 

7162
03:48:38,604 --> 03:48:40,506
REALLY INTERESTING CLUES OF 

7163
03:48:40,506 --> 03:48:42,074
WHERE RACHEL MITCHELL MAY BE 

7164
03:48:42,074 --> 03:48:42,909
GOING WITH THIS. 

7165
03:48:42,909 --> 03:48:43,810
OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS DID NOT 

7166
03:48:43,810 --> 03:48:46,479
WANT TO REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED IN 

7167
03:48:46,479 --> 03:48:50,116
1991, WHERE THEY WERE SEEN AS 

7168
03:48:50,116 --> 03:48:50,583
GRILLING ANITA HILL. 

7169
03:48:50,583 --> 03:48:52,585
SO THIS IS HOW THIS ALL CAME 

7170
03:48:52,585 --> 03:48:52,818
ABOUT. 

7171
03:48:52,818 --> 03:48:54,921
THEY WILL HAVE THIS SEASONED 

7172
03:48:54,921 --> 03:48:56,556
PROSECUTOR FROM OUTSIDE OF 

7173
03:48:56,556 --> 03:48:58,725
WASHINGTO, D.C. ASK THE 

7174
03:48:58,725 --> 03:48:59,025
QUESTIONS. 

7175
03:48:59,025 --> 03:49:00,092
AND YOU KNOW, I THINK JUST 

7176
03:49:00,092 --> 03:49:02,228
BASED ON SOME OF THE SOURCES 

7177
03:49:02,228 --> 03:49:04,230
I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM, IF 

7178
03:49:04,230 --> 03:49:05,531
YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN SENATOR, 

7179
03:49:05,531 --> 03:49:06,833
YOU'RE NOT SO UNHAPPY WITH HOW 

7180
03:49:06,833 --> 03:49:09,736
THIS IS GOING RIGHT NOW, 

7181
03:49:09,736 --> 03:49:10,636
BECAUSE DESPITE LINDSEY GRAHAM 

7182
03:49:10,636 --> 03:49:12,805
JUMPING IN, THEY ARE NOT 

7183
03:49:12,805 --> 03:49:17,110
SITTING THERE ANSWERING THE 

7184
03:49:17,110 --> 03:49:17,443
QUESTIONING. 

7185
03:49:17,443 --> 03:49:19,712
OR THE COMMITTEE, OR FORD 

7186
03:49:19,712 --> 03:49:19,979
HERSELF. 

7187
03:49:19,979 --> 03:49:22,114
WHO THIS LOOKS VERY FAIR TO THE 

7188
03:49:22,114 --> 03:49:22,915
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

7189
03:49:22,915 --> 03:49:24,216
BUT THE QUESTION IS, IT'S NOT 

7190
03:49:24,216 --> 03:49:25,218
REALLY A CROSS EXAM IN ADDITION 

7191
03:49:25,218 --> 03:49:27,753
THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. 

7192
03:49:27,753 --> 03:49:30,923
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR 

7193
03:49:30,923 --> 03:49:31,323
BRETT KAVANAUGH? 

7194
03:49:31,323 --> 03:49:33,626
WHO WILL PUT THESE DOTS 

7195
03:49:33,626 --> 03:49:33,893
TOGETHER? 

7196
03:49:33,893 --> 03:49:36,629
WHEN WILL THE SENATORS SAY, WE 

7197
03:49:36,629 --> 03:49:38,264
HAVE THIS ABOUT THE MAP, WE 

7198
03:49:38,264 --> 03:49:40,032
HAVE THIS ABOUT LOUD MUSIC, BUT 

7199
03:49:40,032 --> 03:49:41,534
IT WAS QUIET DOWNSTAIRS. 

7200
03:49:41,534 --> 03:49:42,535
WHY WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND NOT 

7201
03:49:42,535 --> 03:49:45,304
THINK IT WAS WEIRD SHE HEARD 

7202
03:49:45,304 --> 03:49:45,604
LOUD MUSIC. 

7203
03:49:45,604 --> 03:49:46,806
WHO WILL PUT THOSE DOTS 

7204
03:49:46,806 --> 03:49:47,073
TOGETHER? 

7205
03:49:47,073 --> 03:49:47,740
WE DON'T KNOW THAT. 

7206
03:49:47,740 --> 03:49:53,613
>>  I UNDERSTAND ED O'KEIF WILL 

7207
03:49:53,613 --> 03:49:53,880
JOIN US. 

7208
03:49:53,880 --> 03:49:55,915
>>  THIS WOMAN IS HAVING TO 

7209
03:49:55,915 --> 03:49:57,883
TELL HER STORY TO AMERICA. 

7210
03:49:57,883 --> 03:50:00,219
AND SHE IS DOING AN 

7211
03:50:00,219 --> 03:50:02,688
EXTRAORDINARY JOB IN RECALLING 

7212
03:50:02,688 --> 03:50:04,323
WHAT SHE CAN AND STANDING UP TO 

7213
03:50:04,323 --> 03:50:08,127
THE QUESTIONS FROM A 

7214
03:50:08,127 --> 03:50:09,262
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR AND I 

7215
03:50:09,262 --> 03:50:11,563
AM PROUD OF HOW SHE'S DOING. 

7216
03:50:11,563 --> 03:50:14,667
>>  CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

7217
03:50:14,667 --> 03:50:15,934
EMOTION IN THE ROOM? 

7218
03:50:15,934 --> 03:50:19,505
>>  WELL, FOR ME, THE MEMORY OF 

7219
03:50:19,505 --> 03:50:23,109
SO MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE COME 

7220
03:50:23,109 --> 03:50:24,410
FORWARD IN MY OLD JOB. 

7221
03:50:24,410 --> 03:50:25,912
I SAW WOMEN LIKE HER COME 

7222
03:50:25,912 --> 03:50:27,513
FORWARD AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS 

7223
03:50:27,513 --> 03:50:28,414
EASY AT ALL. 

7224
03:50:28,414 --> 03:50:30,817
AND SHE CLEARLY WAS TRYING TO 

7225
03:50:30,817 --> 03:50:31,650
KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL. 

7226
03:50:31,650 --> 03:50:33,085
SHE STRUGGLED WITH WHAT TO DO. 

7227
03:50:33,085 --> 03:50:35,021
WHEN THE REPORTER SHOWED UP AT 

7228
03:50:35,021 --> 03:50:37,456
HER DOORSTEP, AS SHE FINALLY 

7229
03:50:37,456 --> 03:50:39,659
DECIDED THAT SHE COULDN'T KEEP 

7230
03:50:39,659 --> 03:50:40,559
SILENT AND SHE CAME FORWARD. 

7231
03:50:40,559 --> 03:50:42,261
>>  IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'VE 

7232
03:50:42,261 --> 03:50:45,064
HEARD SO FAR THIS MORNING THAT 

7233
03:50:45,064 --> 03:50:46,165
POTENTIALLY CHANGES WHAT YOU 

7234
03:50:46,165 --> 03:50:47,900
WANT TO ASK OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

7235
03:50:47,900 --> 03:50:48,233
LATER TODAY? 

7236
03:50:48,233 --> 03:50:49,735
>>  I DON'T THINK SO. 

7237
03:50:49,735 --> 03:50:51,637
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SOLID. 

7238
03:50:51,637 --> 03:50:54,207
I THINK TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AS 

7239
03:50:54,207 --> 03:50:55,508
MOST OF AMERICA MUST BE 

7240
03:50:55,508 --> 03:50:57,510
FRUSTRATED THAT WE DON'T HAVE 

7241
03:50:57,510 --> 03:50:59,111
THAT FBI BACKGROUND CHECK 

7242
03:50:59,111 --> 03:50:59,512
REOPENED. 

7243
03:50:59,512 --> 03:51:01,047
SHE SAID SHE COULD BETTER 

7244
03:51:01,047 --> 03:51:02,648
RECALL THE TIME PERIOD IF SHE 

7245
03:51:02,648 --> 03:51:04,150
KNEW WHEN MARK JUDGE WORKED AT 

7246
03:51:04,150 --> 03:51:05,418
THE SAFEWAY AND HE IS HIDING 

7247
03:51:05,418 --> 03:51:07,620
OUT AT A BEACH HOUSE IN 

7248
03:51:07,620 --> 03:51:08,854
DELAWARE AND SHE IS SIMPLY 

7249
03:51:08,854 --> 03:51:11,757
TRYING TO GET THAT INFORMATION 

7250
03:51:11,757 --> 03:51:13,859
AND THE FBI COULD OPEN THAT UP 

7251
03:51:13,859 --> 03:51:15,661
AT THE REQUEST OF THE PRESIDENT 

7252
03:51:15,661 --> 03:51:16,862
OR THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

7253
03:51:16,862 --> 03:51:19,732
ASKING THE PRESIDENT TO OPEN IT 

7254
03:51:19,732 --> 03:51:19,898
UP. 

7255
03:51:19,898 --> 03:51:20,432
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. 

7256
03:51:20,432 --> 03:51:23,069
I THOUGHT THE OTHER INTERESTING 

7257
03:51:23,069 --> 03:51:24,704
THING WAS THAT THERE APPEARED 

7258
03:51:24,704 --> 03:51:27,440
TO BE SOME INITIAL OBJECTION TO 

7259
03:51:27,440 --> 03:51:29,008
PUTTING THE POLYGRAPH TEST IN 

7260
03:51:29,008 --> 03:51:31,243
WHEN THAT IS USED ALL THE TIME 

7261
03:51:31,243 --> 03:51:33,346
BY THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, BY 

7262
03:51:33,346 --> 03:51:35,414
THE FBI, BY THE CIA. 

7263
03:51:35,414 --> 03:51:36,749
THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW FOR THE 

7264
03:51:36,749 --> 03:51:39,618
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 

7265
03:51:39,618 --> 03:51:41,721
WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO PUT IN 

7266
03:51:41,721 --> 03:51:43,255
SOME RECORDS THAT SHOW HER 

7267
03:51:43,255 --> 03:51:43,589
TRUTHFULNESS. 

7268
03:51:43,589 --> 03:51:45,992
>>  WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THOSE 

7269
03:51:45,992 --> 03:51:46,425
MAPS, DO YOU THINK? 

7270
03:51:46,425 --> 03:51:47,359
>>  I DON'T KNOW. 

7271
03:51:47,359 --> 03:51:49,762
I GUESS WE WILL HAVE TO FIND 

7272
03:51:49,762 --> 03:51:49,962
OUT. 

7273
03:51:49,962 --> 03:51:51,030
SHE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION 

7274
03:51:51,030 --> 03:51:51,296
HONESTLY. 

7275
03:51:51,296 --> 03:51:53,666
>>  WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT 

7276
03:51:53,666 --> 03:51:54,099
RACHEL MITCHELL -- 

7277
03:51:54,099 --> 03:51:56,569
>>  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE 

7278
03:51:56,569 --> 03:51:56,969
OVERALL MOVEMENT? 

7279
03:51:56,969 --> 03:51:58,337
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OTHER 

7280
03:51:58,337 --> 03:52:00,940
VICTIMS OF  SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN 

7281
03:52:00,940 --> 03:52:01,807
SHE TESTIFIES LIKE THIS? 

7282
03:52:01,807 --> 03:52:03,843
>>  AS I SAID FOR SO LONG, 

7283
03:52:03,843 --> 03:52:05,544
THESE KINDS OF CASES HAVE BEEN 

7284
03:52:05,544 --> 03:52:07,046
SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. 

7285
03:52:07,046 --> 03:52:08,848
THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN A HOUSE 

7286
03:52:08,848 --> 03:52:12,051
WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE IN A 

7287
03:52:12,051 --> 03:52:12,351
COURTHOUSE. 

7288
03:52:12,351 --> 03:52:12,985
THAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY. 

7289
03:52:12,985 --> 03:52:15,487
THEY ARE IN THE COURTHOUSE OF 

7290
03:52:15,487 --> 03:52:18,257
AMERICA AND THEY WILL MAKE A 

7291
03:52:18,257 --> 03:52:18,524
DECISION. 

7292
03:52:18,524 --> 03:52:20,092
THEY WILL HELP, I HOPE, MY 

7293
03:52:20,092 --> 03:52:21,394
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

7294
03:52:21,394 --> 03:52:23,663
THE AISLE TO MAKE A DECISION 

7295
03:52:23,663 --> 03:52:25,497
ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO SERVE IN 

7296
03:52:25,497 --> 03:52:29,301
THE HIGHEST COURTHOUSE OF THE 

7297
03:52:29,301 --> 03:52:29,501
LAND. 

7298
03:52:29,501 --> 03:52:29,868
ONE LAST THING. 

7299
03:52:29,868 --> 03:52:34,940
>>  THERE YOU HAVE SENATOR AMY, 

7300
03:52:34,940 --> 03:52:35,607
FORMER PROSECUTOR HERSELF. 

7301
03:52:35,607 --> 03:52:38,844
ALSO AS A GRADUATE OF YALE 

7302
03:52:38,844 --> 03:52:40,446
UNIVERSITY TALKING ABOUT WHAT 

7303
03:52:40,446 --> 03:52:40,712
SHE SAW. 

7304
03:52:40,712 --> 03:52:42,748
SHE PUT INTO THE RECORD THE 

7305
03:52:42,748 --> 03:52:45,551
RESULTS OF THAT POLYGRAPH TEST. 

7306
03:52:45,551 --> 03:52:47,753
BUT AS YOU SEE HERE, EACH SIDE 

7307
03:52:47,753 --> 03:52:49,288
IS DUG IN ON US AND IT'S NOT 

7308
03:52:49,288 --> 03:52:50,890
CLEAR THAT ANYONE THERE ON THAT 

7309
03:52:50,890 --> 03:52:52,391
COMMITTEE HAS CHANGED THEIR 

7310
03:52:52,391 --> 03:52:52,591
VIEW. 

7311
03:52:52,591 --> 03:52:53,592
THAT'S QUITE FRANKLY NOT REALLY 

7312
03:52:53,592 --> 03:52:55,694
WHO IT IS DIRECTED TO. 

7313
03:52:55,694 --> 03:52:57,797
IT'S SOME OF THESE MODERATE 

7314
03:52:57,797 --> 03:53:00,599
SENATORS WHO WILL DECIDE JUDGE 

7315
03:53:00,599 --> 03:53:01,100
KAVANAUGH'S VOTE. 

7316
03:53:01,100 --> 03:53:02,568
A COUPLE PIECES OF INFORMATION, 

7317
03:53:02,568 --> 03:53:03,869
THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE BEEN 

7318
03:53:03,869 --> 03:53:05,037
WATCHING ALL OF THIS, INCLUDING 

7319
03:53:05,037 --> 03:53:06,439
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

7320
03:53:06,439 --> 03:53:08,941
STATES HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS 

7321
03:53:08,941 --> 03:53:09,942
TESTIMONY BY DR. FORD. 

7322
03:53:09,942 --> 03:53:12,178
WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT JUDGE 

7323
03:53:12,178 --> 03:53:13,446
KAVANAUGH HAS WATCHED HER 

7324
03:53:13,446 --> 03:53:13,946
TESTIMONY. 

7325
03:53:13,946 --> 03:53:16,248
HE HAS JUST RECENTLY LEFT HIS 

7326
03:53:16,248 --> 03:53:18,150
HOME UP IN MARYLAND TO HEAD 

7327
03:53:18,150 --> 03:53:20,553
DOWN HERE TO CAPITOL HILL FOR 

7328
03:53:20,553 --> 03:53:22,587
HIS PART OF THE TESTIMONY WHERE 

7329
03:53:22,587 --> 03:53:23,989
HE WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THAT 

7330
03:53:23,989 --> 03:53:25,191
QUESTION ABOUT HIS OWN 

7331
03:53:25,191 --> 03:53:27,493
CHARACTER, ABOUT HIS OWN 

7332
03:53:27,493 --> 03:53:30,896
CREDIBILITY, AS DR. FORD HAS 

7333
03:53:30,896 --> 03:53:32,998
SAID SHE IS 100% SURE THAT IT 

7334
03:53:32,998 --> 03:53:35,301
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO 

7335
03:53:35,301 --> 03:53:37,470
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER MORE 

7336
03:53:37,470 --> 03:53:38,571
THAN 36 YEARS AGO. 

7337
03:53:38,571 --> 03:53:40,239
NANCY CORDES AND I HAVE BEEN 

7338
03:53:40,239 --> 03:53:42,541
SITTING HIP TO HIP WATCHING 

7339
03:53:42,541 --> 03:53:43,008
THESE HEARINGS. 

7340
03:53:43,008 --> 03:53:44,543
EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SO 

7341
03:53:44,543 --> 03:53:44,743
FAR. 

7342
03:53:44,743 --> 03:53:45,778
WHAT HAS STOOD OUT TO YOU? 

7343
03:53:45,778 --> 03:53:48,748
>>  I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING 

7344
03:53:48,748 --> 03:53:50,583
IS THAT RACHEL MITCHELL, THE 

7345
03:53:50,583 --> 03:53:52,351
PROSECUTOR WHO IS WORKING ON 

7346
03:53:52,351 --> 03:53:55,287
BEHALF OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

7347
03:53:55,287 --> 03:53:56,689
REPUBLICANS IS CLEARLY TRYING 

7348
03:53:56,689 --> 03:54:00,493
TO POKE HOLES GENTLY IN 

7349
03:54:00,493 --> 03:54:02,495
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S 

7350
03:54:02,495 --> 03:54:02,828
CREDIBILITY. 

7351
03:54:02,828 --> 03:54:04,296
ASKING HER, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER 

7352
03:54:04,296 --> 03:54:07,032
BLASEY FORD SAID ONE OF THE 

7353
03:54:07,032 --> 03:54:08,100
LASTING IMPACTS OF THIS TRAUMA 

7354
03:54:08,100 --> 03:54:10,703
IS SHE HAS A FEAR OF ENCLOSED 

7355
03:54:10,703 --> 03:54:10,936
SPACES. 

7356
03:54:10,936 --> 03:54:11,971
SHE WANTED TWO FRONT DOORS TO 

7357
03:54:11,971 --> 03:54:13,639
HER HOUSE, WHICH IS NOT 

7358
03:54:13,639 --> 03:54:14,172
PLEASING FROM THE STREET. 

7359
03:54:14,172 --> 03:54:17,476
>>  SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO FLY. 

7360
03:54:17,476 --> 03:54:19,478
SO THEN YOU HEARD THE 

7361
03:54:19,478 --> 03:54:21,180
PROSECUTOR SAY, WELL WHY IS IT 

7362
03:54:21,180 --> 03:54:23,582
THEN THAT YOU HAVE TRAVELED TO 

7363
03:54:23,582 --> 03:54:26,085
THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND COSTA 

7364
03:54:26,085 --> 03:54:28,087
RICA AND HAWAII TO SURF? 

7365
03:54:28,087 --> 03:54:29,488
AND WHAT BLASEY FORD SAID WAS 

7366
03:54:29,488 --> 03:54:31,824
THAT IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR ME 

7367
03:54:31,824 --> 03:54:33,626
TO FLY ON VACATION THAN IT IS 

7368
03:54:33,626 --> 03:54:35,794
TO COME BACK HERE TO THE EAST 

7369
03:54:35,794 --> 03:54:36,027
COAST. 

7370
03:54:36,027 --> 03:54:37,796
I ONLY DO IT ONCE A YEAR. 

7371
03:54:37,796 --> 03:54:41,800
IT'S AN APPROACH LIKE THAT, 

7372
03:54:41,800 --> 03:54:42,167
RESPECTFUL, NOT 

7373
03:54:42,167 --> 03:54:44,236
CONFRONTATIONAL, THIS IS NOT 12 

7374
03:54:44,236 --> 03:54:46,105
ANGRY MEN, BUT STILL TRYING TO 

7375
03:54:46,105 --> 03:54:47,773
FIND HOLES IN HER STORY AND IN 

7376
03:54:47,773 --> 03:54:48,173
HER CREDIBILITY. 

7377
03:54:48,173 --> 03:54:50,743
>>  SO THEN HERE'S THE QUESTION 

7378
03:54:50,743 --> 03:54:52,178
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT, 

7379
03:54:52,178 --> 03:54:56,482
WHICH IS THAT WHILE RACHEL HAS 

7380
03:54:56,482 --> 03:54:59,018
PERHAPS HELPED THE REPUBLICANS, 

7381
03:54:59,018 --> 03:55:03,522
BECAUSE SHE HAS DONE VERY 

7382
03:55:03,522 --> 03:55:06,225
CAREFUL POINTED QUESTIONS IN A 

7383
03:55:06,225 --> 03:55:10,529
SERIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL WAY. 

7384
03:55:10,529 --> 03:55:12,331
HAS IT BENEFITED JUDGE 

7385
03:55:12,331 --> 03:55:12,631
KAVANAUGH? 

7386
03:55:12,631 --> 03:55:14,266
HAS IT BENEFITED THOSE IN THE 

7387
03:55:14,266 --> 03:55:14,633
KAVANAUGH CAMP? 

7388
03:55:14,633 --> 03:55:15,667
THOSE IN THE WHITE HOUSE? 

7389
03:55:15,667 --> 03:55:16,402
SPECIFICALLY THE PRESIDENT OF 

7390
03:55:16,402 --> 03:55:17,703
THE UNITED STATES THAT BELIEVE 

7391
03:55:17,703 --> 03:55:19,471
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TOUGH ENOUGH 

7392
03:55:19,471 --> 03:55:21,073
PUSHING BACK ON THIS PARTICULAR 

7393
03:55:21,073 --> 03:55:21,473
WITNESS ACCOUNT. 

7394
03:55:21,473 --> 03:55:24,477
>>  I THINK SHE IS ABLE TO LOOK 

7395
03:55:24,477 --> 03:55:28,080
FOR THOSE CREDIBILITY GAPS IN A 

7396
03:55:28,080 --> 03:55:30,482
MORE SUSTAINED WAY THAN A BUNCH 

7397
03:55:30,482 --> 03:55:32,550
OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS ALL 

7398
03:55:32,550 --> 03:55:35,353
COMING LOADED WOULD BE ABLE TO. 

7399
03:55:35,353 --> 03:55:37,623
SHE IS GOING METHODICALLY 

7400
03:55:37,623 --> 03:55:39,024
THROUGH BLASEY FORD'S 

7401
03:55:39,024 --> 03:55:40,359
BACKGROUND, THROUGH HER STORY. 

7402
03:55:40,359 --> 03:55:41,927
YOU DIDN'T ORIGINALLY WANT TO 

7403
03:55:41,927 --> 03:55:42,428
HIRE A LAWYER. 

7404
03:55:42,428 --> 03:55:44,430
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO HIRE A 

7405
03:55:44,430 --> 03:55:44,797
LAWYER? 

7406
03:55:44,797 --> 03:55:47,733
IN A LOT OF THESE CASES, FORD 

7407
03:55:47,733 --> 03:55:48,266
HAS BELIEVABLE ANSWERS. 

7408
03:55:48,266 --> 03:55:49,634
WELL, AT FIRST I NEVER BEEN IN 

7409
03:55:49,634 --> 03:55:50,636
A SITUATION LIKE THIS. 

7410
03:55:50,636 --> 03:55:52,605
I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED A 

7411
03:55:52,605 --> 03:55:52,838
LAWYER. 

7412
03:55:52,838 --> 03:55:55,507
BUT THEN ALL MY FRIENDS ON THE 

7413
03:55:55,507 --> 03:55:56,742
BEACH STARTED SAYING, YOU 

7414
03:55:56,742 --> 03:55:57,309
SHOULD GET A LAWYER. 

7415
03:55:57,309 --> 03:55:59,511
WHY DID YOU GET A POLYGRAPH? 

7416
03:55:59,511 --> 03:56:02,915
I WAS TOLD THAT WOULD BE A GOOD 

7417
03:56:02,915 --> 03:56:03,115
IDEA. 

7418
03:56:03,115 --> 03:56:04,616
WHICH FROM A 51-YEAR-OLD MOTHER 

7419
03:56:04,616 --> 03:56:06,518
OF TWO, SHE ANSWERS THOSE 

7420
03:56:06,518 --> 03:56:07,519
QUESTIONS LIKE MY FRIENDS TOLD 

7421
03:56:07,519 --> 03:56:09,755
ME IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. 

7422
03:56:09,755 --> 03:56:12,925
SHE HAS REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS 

7423
03:56:12,925 --> 03:56:14,225
ONE MIGHT SAY TO THESE ANSWERS. 

7424
03:56:14,225 --> 03:56:14,927
>>  YES. 

7425
03:56:14,927 --> 03:56:16,362
IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN AND 

7426
03:56:16,362 --> 03:56:17,930
YOU'RE LOOKING POLITICALLY FOR 

7427
03:56:17,930 --> 03:56:20,432
A REASON TO SAY, NO, EVEN AFTER 

7428
03:56:20,432 --> 03:56:21,934
ALL OF THIS, EVEN THOUGH SHE 

7429
03:56:21,934 --> 03:56:24,536
GAVE CREDIBLE ANSWERS, I STILL 

7430
03:56:24,536 --> 03:56:25,103
BELIEVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

7431
03:56:25,103 --> 03:56:28,107
THEY ARE LOOKING TO MITCHELL TO 

7432
03:56:28,107 --> 03:56:29,208
FIND THOSE EXAMPLES WHERE HER 

7433
03:56:29,208 --> 03:56:30,775
STORY MIGHT NOT LINE UP. 

7434
03:56:30,775 --> 03:56:32,544
WHY DOESN'T SHE KNOW HOW SHE 

7435
03:56:32,544 --> 03:56:34,513
GOT 6 OR 8 MILES HOME THAT 

7436
03:56:34,513 --> 03:56:34,746
NIGHT? 

7437
03:56:34,746 --> 03:56:36,515
THAT MAY BE ENOUGH FOR THEM 

7438
03:56:36,515 --> 03:56:37,850
POLITICALLY TO SAY, I STILL 

7439
03:56:37,850 --> 03:56:38,283
BELIEVE KAVANAUGH. 

7440
03:56:38,283 --> 03:56:41,220
>>  THIS IS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED 

7441
03:56:41,220 --> 03:56:43,055
THIS MORNING, IS THAT THIS 

7442
03:56:43,055 --> 03:56:43,856
ALLEGATION AGAINST JUDGE 

7443
03:56:43,856 --> 03:56:46,258
KAVANAUGH HAS COME FROM A VERY 

7444
03:56:46,258 --> 03:56:46,625
CREDIBLE WOMAN. 

7445
03:56:46,625 --> 03:56:49,027
AND IN THE WORDS OF SENATOR 

7446
03:56:49,027 --> 03:56:50,262
FEINSTEIN, SHE SAID THIS 

7447
03:56:50,262 --> 03:56:51,964
MORNING, THIS IS A JOB 

7448
03:56:51,964 --> 03:56:53,365
INTERVIEW FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

7449
03:56:53,365 --> 03:56:55,267
AND THE STAKES I THINK ARE EVEN 

7450
03:56:55,267 --> 03:56:58,003
HIGHER NOW FOR THE TESTIMONY 

7451
03:56:58,003 --> 03:56:59,638
THAT HE GIVES COMING UP AFTER 

7452
03:56:59,638 --> 03:57:00,706
THEY FINISH WITH DR. FORD. 

7453
03:57:00,706 --> 03:57:03,008
WHAT IS HE GOING TO SAY TO 

7454
03:57:03,008 --> 03:57:04,410
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

7455
03:57:04,410 --> 03:57:05,343
WHETHER HE WAS INVOLVED AND 

7456
03:57:05,343 --> 03:57:08,380
WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS VERY 

7457
03:57:08,380 --> 03:57:08,780
SERIOUS ASSAULT. 

7458
03:57:08,780 --> 03:57:11,316
>>  IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT 

7459
03:57:11,316 --> 03:57:11,617
TEST. 

7460
03:57:11,617 --> 03:57:14,753
ALL HE REALLY CAN SAY IS, I 

7461
03:57:14,753 --> 03:57:15,654
WASN'T THERE. 

7462
03:57:15,654 --> 03:57:19,024
HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU SAY, I 

7463
03:57:19,024 --> 03:57:19,391
WASN'T THERE. 

7464
03:57:19,391 --> 03:57:21,660
THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME BEST 

7465
03:57:21,660 --> 03:57:23,362
SAID I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING 

7466
03:57:23,362 --> 03:57:23,862
LIKE THIS. 

7467
03:57:23,862 --> 03:57:24,763
WHEN YOU ARE GRILLED FOR TWO 

7468
03:57:24,763 --> 03:57:26,765
HOURS WITH THOSE QUESTIONS, 

7469
03:57:26,765 --> 03:57:28,133
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND A NEW 

7470
03:57:28,133 --> 03:57:28,567
WAY TO SAY IT. 

7471
03:57:28,567 --> 03:57:31,070
>>  YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT 

7472
03:57:31,070 --> 03:57:32,237
IT THERE, JEFF, GAYLE, JAN. 

7473
03:57:32,237 --> 03:57:35,441
>>  I THINK THE POINT NANCY WAS 

7474
03:57:35,441 --> 03:57:36,641
MAKING IS QUITE RIGHT. 

7475
03:57:36,641 --> 03:57:39,011
WE HAVE SEEN DR. FORD GIVE 

7476
03:57:39,011 --> 03:57:40,112
DETAILS, BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT 

7477
03:57:40,112 --> 03:57:42,280
A WHOLE SET OF MEMORIES. 

7478
03:57:42,280 --> 03:57:43,816
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WHEN HE COMES 

7479
03:57:43,816 --> 03:57:44,917
FORWARD, HE CAN'T BE DETAILED 

7480
03:57:44,917 --> 03:57:46,618
ABOUT A THING THAT DOESN'T 

7481
03:57:46,618 --> 03:57:47,019
HAPPEN. 

7482
03:57:47,019 --> 03:57:49,121
AND THEREFORE, HIS TESTIMONY, 

7483
03:57:49,121 --> 03:57:50,823
HIS PERIOD BEFORE QUESTIONING 

7484
03:57:50,823 --> 03:57:52,825
WILL BE JUST SO VERY MUCH 

7485
03:57:52,825 --> 03:57:53,125
DIFFERENT. 

7486
03:57:53,125 --> 03:57:54,760
>>  HE'S ALSO SAID, I BELIEVE 

7487
03:57:54,760 --> 03:57:56,128
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER. 

7488
03:57:56,128 --> 03:57:58,464
I'M SAYING IT WAS NOT ME. 

7489
03:57:58,464 --> 03:57:59,765
HE'S BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR 

7490
03:57:59,765 --> 03:58:00,265
ABOUT THAT. 

7491
03:58:00,265 --> 03:58:01,567
HE'S NOT DISPUTING SOMETHING 

7492
03:58:01,567 --> 03:58:02,067
HAPPENED TO HER. 

7493
03:58:02,067 --> 03:58:03,869
HE IS JUST SAYING I WAS NOT THE 

7494
03:58:03,869 --> 03:58:04,269
PERSON. 

7495
03:58:04,269 --> 03:58:05,738
>>  IF HIS ANSWER IS, THAT 

7496
03:58:05,738 --> 03:58:07,272
WASN'T ME, IT GIVES THE 

7497
03:58:07,272 --> 03:58:08,640
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS TO ASK HIM 

7498
03:58:08,640 --> 03:58:10,008
ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. 

7499
03:58:10,008 --> 03:58:12,544
HOW MUCH DID YOU DRINK IN HIGH 

7500
03:58:12,544 --> 03:58:12,777
SCHOOL? 

7501
03:58:12,777 --> 03:58:14,780
WHAT KIND OF -- GOING TO ALL 

7502
03:58:14,780 --> 03:58:16,314
THESE DETAILS ABOUT HIS 

7503
03:58:16,314 --> 03:58:17,750
PERSONAL LIFE THAT I EXPECT 

7504
03:58:17,750 --> 03:58:18,817
YOU'LL SEE THIS AFTERNOON. 

7505
03:58:18,817 --> 03:58:21,220
>>  DR. FORD HAS NOT BEEN ON 

7506
03:58:21,220 --> 03:58:23,155
TRIAL THIS MORNING, BUT JUDGE 

7507
03:58:23,155 --> 03:58:25,057
KAVANAUGH WILL BE ON TRIAL THIS 

7508
03:58:25,057 --> 03:58:25,457
AFTERNOON. 

7509
03:58:25,457 --> 03:58:27,059
THEY ARE GOING TO GRILL HIM. 

7510
03:58:27,059 --> 03:58:28,794
EXACTLY ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST 

7511
03:58:28,794 --> 03:58:29,361
TALKED ABOUT. 

7512
03:58:29,361 --> 03:58:31,263
NOT ONLY ABOUT HIS SEXUAL 

7513
03:58:31,263 --> 03:58:32,264
HISTORY, WHAT HE HAS SAID IN 

7514
03:58:32,264 --> 03:58:34,566
THE PAST ABOUT HIS SEXUAL 

7515
03:58:34,566 --> 03:58:34,967
HISTORY. 

7516
03:58:34,967 --> 03:58:38,337
HOW MUCH HE DRANK, WHETHER HE 

7517
03:58:38,337 --> 03:58:39,538
WAS THE TREASURER OF A GROUP 

7518
03:58:39,538 --> 03:58:42,207
THAT WANTED TO DRINK 100 KEGS 

7519
03:58:42,207 --> 03:58:42,808
IN THEIR SENIOR YEAR. 

7520
03:58:42,808 --> 03:58:44,609
THEY ARE GOING TO TEST HIM. 

7521
03:58:44,609 --> 03:58:46,245
>>  AND NORA, YOU HEARD THE 

7522
03:58:46,245 --> 03:58:48,714
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE, 

7523
03:58:48,714 --> 03:58:49,448
CHUCK GRASSLEY, VERY EXPRESSLY 

7524
03:58:49,448 --> 03:58:51,016
AT THE START OF THIS HEARING 

7525
03:58:51,016 --> 03:58:53,652
TRY TO SET SOME GROUND RULES 

7526
03:58:53,652 --> 03:58:55,688
AND SAY WE'RE TALKING JUST 

7527
03:58:55,688 --> 03:58:56,788
ABOUT THIS ONE CASE. 

7528
03:58:56,788 --> 03:58:57,556
THESE DEMOCRAT SENATORS WILL 

7529
03:58:57,556 --> 03:59:00,259
WANT TO ASK HIM ABOUT THE OTHER 

7530
03:59:00,259 --> 03:59:01,059
ACCUSERS AS WELL. 

7531
03:59:01,059 --> 03:59:02,728
JOHN. 

7532
03:59:02,728 --> 03:59:14,673
>>  JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE 

7533
03:59:14,673 --> 03:59:15,674
HAVE QUITE A FULL DAY OF 

7534
03:59:15,674 --> 03:59:18,444
TESTIMONY HERE AND THEN OF 

7535
03:59:18,444 --> 03:59:19,611
COURSE ALL OF THE ANALYSIS 

7536
03:59:19,611 --> 03:59:19,912
AFTERWARDS. 

7537
03:59:19,912 --> 03:59:22,147
>> WE'LL BE HERE ALL AFTERNOON 

7538
03:59:22,147 --> 03:59:24,183
AND THEN FOR THE EVENING NEWS 

7539
03:59:24,183 --> 03:59:24,450
TONIGHT. 

7540
03:59:24,450 --> 03:59:26,018
>> JAN, JEFF, GAYLE KING, 

7541
03:59:26,018 --> 03:59:28,020
THANKS SO MUCH, NORAH AND NANCY 

7542
03:59:28,020 --> 03:59:31,156
AND FOR ALL OF YOU, THANKS FOR 

7543
03:59:31,156 --> 03:59:31,323
WATCHING. 

7544
03:59:33,358 --> 03:59:38,797
WATCHING.

7545
03:59:38,930 --> 03:59:40,399
>>> NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT 

7546
03:59:40,399 --> 03:59:42,167
SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL 

7547
03:59:42,167 --> 03:59:43,702
MOMENTS OF THE TESTIMONY SO 

7548
03:59:43,702 --> 03:59:43,902
FAR. 

7549
03:59:43,902 --> 03:59:46,905
>> BOTH DR. FORD AND JUDGE 

7550
03:59:46,905 --> 03:59:50,709
KAVANAUGH HAVE BEEN THROUGH A 

7551
03:59:50,709 --> 03:59:52,511
TERRIBLE COUPLE WEEKS. 

7552
03:59:52,511 --> 03:59:55,948
THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE 

7553
03:59:55,948 --> 03:59:56,815
RECEIVED VIAL THREATS. 

7554
03:59:56,815 --> 03:59:58,650
WHAT THEY HAVE ENDURED OUGHT TO 

7555
03:59:58,650 --> 04:00:03,689
BE CONSIDERED BY ALL OF US AS 

7556
04:00:03,689 --> 04:00:05,958
UNACCEPTABLE AND A POOR 

7557
04:00:05,958 --> 04:00:08,794
REFLECTION ON THE STATE OF 

7558
04:00:08,794 --> 04:00:10,896
CIVILITY IN OUR DEMOCRACY. 

7559
04:00:10,896 --> 04:00:13,398
SO I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU 

7560
04:00:13,398 --> 04:00:17,069
BOTH FOR THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN 

7561
04:00:17,069 --> 04:00:21,874
TREATED, AND I INTEND HOPEFULLY 

7562
04:00:21,874 --> 04:00:23,842
FOR TODAY'S HEARING TO BE SAFE, 

7563
04:00:23,842 --> 04:00:26,812
COMFORTABLE AND DIGNIFIED FOR 

7564
04:00:26,812 --> 04:00:27,512
BOTH OF OUR WITNESSES. 

7565
04:00:27,512 --> 04:00:30,449
I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN 

7566
04:00:30,449 --> 04:00:34,586
ME IN THIS EFFORT OF A SHOW OF 

7567
04:00:34,586 --> 04:00:34,852
CIVILITY. 

7568
04:00:34,852 --> 04:00:37,923
>> THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF 

7569
04:00:37,923 --> 04:00:38,924
PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ME 

7570
04:00:38,924 --> 04:00:42,594
TOO MOVEMENT TODAY VERSUS THE 

7571
04:00:42,594 --> 04:00:44,863
YEAR OF THE WOMAN ALMOST 27 

7572
04:00:44,863 --> 04:00:45,163
YEARS AGO. 

7573
04:00:45,163 --> 04:00:47,699
BUT WHILE YOUNG WOMEN ARE 

7574
04:00:47,699 --> 04:00:50,469
STANDING UP AND SAYING NO MORE, 

7575
04:00:50,469 --> 04:00:52,504
OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT 

7576
04:00:52,504 --> 04:00:54,907
PROGRESSED IN HOW THEY TREAT 

7577
04:00:54,907 --> 04:00:56,508
WOMEN WHO COME FORWARD. 

7578
04:00:56,508 --> 04:00:59,811
TOO OFTEN WOMEN'S MEMORIES AND 

7579
04:00:59,811 --> 04:01:02,080
CREDIBILITY COME UNDER ASSAULT. 

7580
04:01:02,080 --> 04:01:06,018
IN ESSENCE, THEY ARE PUT ON 

7581
04:01:06,018 --> 04:01:08,387
TRIAL AND FORCED TO DEFEND 

7582
04:01:08,387 --> 04:01:09,688
THEMSELVES AND OFTEN 

7583
04:01:09,688 --> 04:01:10,322
REVICTIMMIZED IN THE PROCESS. 

7584
04:01:10,322 --> 04:01:12,291
>> DO YOU SWEAR THAT THE 

7585
04:01:12,291 --> 04:01:13,292
TESTIMONY YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE 

7586
04:01:13,292 --> 04:01:14,526
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE 

7587
04:01:14,526 --> 04:01:15,661
THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND 

7588
04:01:15,661 --> 04:01:19,331
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH SO HELP 

7589
04:01:19,331 --> 04:01:19,598
YOU GOD? 

7590
04:01:19,598 --> 04:01:20,732
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

7591
04:01:20,732 --> 04:01:21,499
>> I DON'T HAVE ALL THE 

7592
04:01:21,499 --> 04:01:22,968
ANSWERS, AND I DON'T REMEMBER 

7593
04:01:22,968 --> 04:01:26,805
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO, BUT 

7594
04:01:26,805 --> 04:01:27,506
THE DETAILS ABOUT THAT NIGHT 

7595
04:01:27,506 --> 04:01:29,741
THAT BRING ME HERE TODAY ARE 

7596
04:01:29,741 --> 04:01:32,044
THE ONES I WILL NEVER FORGET. 

7597
04:01:32,044 --> 04:01:35,013
THEY HAVE BEEN SEARED INTO MY 

7598
04:01:35,013 --> 04:01:38,650
MEMORY AND HAVE HAUNTED ME EPI 

7599
04:01:38,650 --> 04:01:39,217
SODICLY AS AN ADULT. 

7600
04:01:39,217 --> 04:01:42,387
WHEN I GOT TO THE SMALL 

7601
04:01:42,387 --> 04:01:44,856
GATHERING PEOPLE WERE DRINKING 

7602
04:01:44,856 --> 04:01:46,024
BEER IN A SMALL LIVING 

7603
04:01:46,024 --> 04:01:46,658
ROOM/FAMILY ROOM TYPE AREA ON 

7604
04:01:46,658 --> 04:01:51,496
THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. 

7605
04:01:51,496 --> 04:01:54,299
I DRANK ONE BEER BRETT AND MARK 

7606
04:01:54,299 --> 04:01:54,799
WERE VISIBLY DRUNK. 

7607
04:01:54,799 --> 04:01:57,169
EARLY IN THE EVENING I WENT UP 

7608
04:01:57,169 --> 04:01:58,770
A VERY NARROW SET OF STAIRS 

7609
04:01:58,770 --> 04:02:01,707
LEADING FROM THE LIVING ROOM TO 

7610
04:02:01,707 --> 04:02:03,041
A SECOND FLOOR TO USE THE REST 

7611
04:02:03,041 --> 04:02:03,241
ROOM. 

7612
04:02:03,241 --> 04:02:06,745
WHEN I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE 

7613
04:02:06,745 --> 04:02:08,947
STAIRS, I WAS PUSHED FROM 

7614
04:02:08,947 --> 04:02:11,016
BEHIND INTO A BEDROOM ACROSS 

7615
04:02:11,016 --> 04:02:12,316
FROM THE BATHROOM. 

7616
04:02:12,316 --> 04:02:14,519
I COULDN'T SEE WHO PUSHED ME. 

7617
04:02:14,519 --> 04:02:17,656
BRETT AND MARK CAME INTO THE 

7618
04:02:17,656 --> 04:02:20,859
BEDROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR 

7619
04:02:20,859 --> 04:02:22,294
BEHIND THEM. 

7620
04:02:22,294 --> 04:02:24,429
THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING IN THE 

7621
04:02:24,429 --> 04:02:24,696
BEDROOM. 

7622
04:02:24,696 --> 04:02:26,031
IT WAS TURNED UP LOUDER BY 

7623
04:02:26,031 --> 04:02:28,400
EITHER BRETT OR MARK ONCE WE 

7624
04:02:28,400 --> 04:02:29,267
WERE IN THE ROOM. 

7625
04:02:29,267 --> 04:02:32,070
I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED AND 

7626
04:02:32,070 --> 04:02:33,972
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME. 

7627
04:02:33,972 --> 04:02:37,609
HE BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER 

7628
04:02:37,609 --> 04:02:41,013
MY BODY AND GRINDING INTO ME. 

7629
04:02:41,013 --> 04:02:42,681
I YELLED, HOPING THAT SOMEONE 

7630
04:02:42,681 --> 04:02:44,016
DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME, AND I 

7631
04:02:44,016 --> 04:02:48,420
TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM, BUT 

7632
04:02:48,420 --> 04:02:48,920
HIS WEIGHT WAS HEAVY. 

7633
04:02:48,920 --> 04:02:51,056
BRETT GROPED ME AND TRIED TO 

7634
04:02:51,056 --> 04:02:52,657
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. 

7635
04:02:52,657 --> 04:02:56,294
HE HAD A HARD TIME BECAUSE HE 

7636
04:02:56,294 --> 04:02:58,597
WAS VERY INEBRIATED AND BECAUSE 

7637
04:02:58,597 --> 04:03:01,399
I WAS WEARING A ONE-PIECE 

7638
04:03:01,399 --> 04:03:03,568
BATHING SUIT UNDERNEATH MY 

7639
04:03:03,568 --> 04:03:03,835
CLOTHING. 

7640
04:03:03,835 --> 04:03:05,437
I BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO RAPE 

7641
04:03:05,437 --> 04:03:06,238
ME. 

7642
04:03:06,238 --> 04:03:08,273
I TRIED TO YELL FOR HELP. 

7643
04:03:08,273 --> 04:03:09,474
WHEN I DID, BRETT PUT HIS HAND 

7644
04:03:09,474 --> 04:03:12,744
OVER MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM 

7645
04:03:12,744 --> 04:03:13,011
YELLING. 

7646
04:03:13,011 --> 04:03:14,813
THIS IS WHAT TERRIFIED ME THE 

7647
04:03:14,813 --> 04:03:16,815
MOST AND HAS HAD THE MOST 

7648
04:03:16,815 --> 04:03:18,550
LASTING IMPACT ON MY LIFE. 

7649
04:03:18,550 --> 04:03:20,719
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE, 

7650
04:03:20,719 --> 04:03:23,288
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 

7651
04:03:23,288 --> 04:03:24,556
DISEMLY GOING TO KILL ME. 

7652
04:03:24,556 --> 04:03:26,358
-- WAS DISEMLY GOING TO KILL 

7653
04:03:26,358 --> 04:03:26,758
ME. 

7654
04:03:26,758 --> 04:03:28,192
>> MY NAME IS RACHEL MITCHELL. 

7655
04:03:28,192 --> 04:03:28,961
>> NICE TO MEET YOU. 

7656
04:03:28,961 --> 04:03:30,829
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE 

7657
04:03:30,829 --> 04:03:31,697
FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME FROM 

7658
04:03:31,697 --> 04:03:33,198
YOUR STATEMENT THIS MORNING IS 

7659
04:03:33,198 --> 04:03:34,099
THAT YOU WERE TERRIFIED, AND I 

7660
04:03:34,099 --> 04:03:38,770
JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I'M 

7661
04:03:38,770 --> 04:03:39,071
VERY SORRY. 

7662
04:03:39,071 --> 04:03:39,504
THAT'S NOT RIGHT. 

7663
04:03:39,504 --> 04:03:41,673
>> WELL, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT 

7664
04:03:41,673 --> 04:03:42,841
IMPACT THE INVESTMENTS HAD ON 

7665
04:03:42,841 --> 04:03:47,045
YOU -- WHAT IMPACT THE EVENTS 

7666
04:03:47,045 --> 04:03:49,047
HAD ON YOU? 

7667
04:03:49,047 --> 04:03:50,682
>> WELL, I THINK THE SEXUAL 

7668
04:03:50,682 --> 04:03:52,985
ASSAULT VARIES BY PERSON, AND 

7669
04:03:52,985 --> 04:03:55,620
SO FOR ME PERSONALLY ANXIETY, 

7670
04:03:55,620 --> 04:03:56,855
PHOBIA AND PTSD-LIKE SYMPTOMS 

7671
04:03:56,855 --> 04:03:58,923
AR THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN 

7672
04:03:58,923 --> 04:03:59,257
COPING WITH. 

7673
04:03:59,257 --> 04:04:01,927
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW BRETT 

7674
04:04:01,927 --> 04:04:02,661
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE? 

7675
04:04:02,661 --> 04:04:04,663
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU WOULD 

7676
04:04:04,663 --> 04:04:06,531
MIX THEM UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE? 

7677
04:04:06,531 --> 04:04:10,535
>> NO, IT IS NOT, AND THE 

7678
04:04:10,535 --> 04:04:12,104
PERSON THAT WAS BLAMED FOR THE 

7679
04:04:12,104 --> 04:04:14,506
INCIDENT IS ACTUALLY THE PERSON 

7680
04:04:14,506 --> 04:04:15,507
WHO INTRODUCED ME TO THEM 

7681
04:04:15,507 --> 04:04:17,375
ORIGINALLY, SO HE WAS A MEMBER 

7682
04:04:17,375 --> 04:04:18,977
OF COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB, AND I 

7683
04:04:18,977 --> 04:04:20,779
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIM 

7684
04:04:20,779 --> 04:04:21,879
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S UNFAIR. 

7685
04:04:21,879 --> 04:04:26,151
BUT HE IS THE PERSON THAT 

7686
04:04:26,151 --> 04:04:27,018
INTRODUCED ME TO THEM. 

7687
04:04:27,018 --> 04:04:28,653
>> BUT YOU WOULD NOT MIX UP 

7688
04:04:28,653 --> 04:04:31,056
SOMEBODY ELSE WITH BRETT 

7689
04:04:31,056 --> 04:04:33,925
KAVANAUGH, IS THAT CORRECT? 

7690
04:04:33,925 --> 04:04:34,359
>> CORRECT. 

7691
04:04:34,359 --> 04:04:36,061
>> OR MARK JUDGE? 

7692
04:04:36,061 --> 04:04:36,361
>> CORRECT. 

7693
04:04:36,361 --> 04:04:40,132
>> WHAT IS THE STRONGEST MEMORY 

7694
04:04:40,132 --> 04:04:42,467
YOU HAVE, STRONGEST MEMORY OF 

7695
04:04:42,467 --> 04:04:44,202
THE INCIDENT, SOMETHING THAT 

7696
04:04:44,202 --> 04:04:48,373
YOU CANNOT FORGET? 

7697
04:04:48,373 --> 04:04:49,140
TAKE WHATEVER TIME YOU NEED. 

7698
04:04:49,140 --> 04:04:53,011
>> INDELLIBLE IN THE CAMPUS IS 

7699
04:04:53,011 --> 04:04:56,247
THE LAUGHTER, THE UPROARIOUS 

7700
04:04:56,247 --> 04:05:01,420
LAUGHTER BETWEEN THE TWO AND 

7701
04:05:01,420 --> 04:05:02,620
THEIR HAVING FUN AT MY EXPENSE. 

7702
04:05:02,620 --> 04:05:03,789
>> IN JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S OPENING 

7703
04:05:03,789 --> 04:05:06,024
TESTIMONY WHICH WE WILL HEAR 

7704
04:05:06,024 --> 04:05:08,093
AFTER YOU LEAVE, THIS IS WHAT 

7705
04:05:08,093 --> 04:05:10,262
HE SAYS, I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 

7706
04:05:10,262 --> 04:05:12,230
OR PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER OF ANY 

7707
04:05:12,230 --> 04:05:14,399
KIND WITH DR. FORD. 

7708
04:05:14,399 --> 04:05:15,801
I AM NOT QUESTIONING THAT DR. 

7709
04:05:15,801 --> 04:05:17,435
FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY 

7710
04:05:17,435 --> 04:05:20,972
ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON IN 

7711
04:05:20,972 --> 04:05:21,940
SOME PLACE AT SOME TIME. 

7712
04:05:21,940 --> 04:05:23,441
LAST NIGHT THE REPUBLICAN STAFF 

7713
04:05:23,441 --> 04:05:25,310
OF THIS COMMITTEE RELEASED TO 

7714
04:05:25,310 --> 04:05:27,412
THE MEDIA A TIMELINE THAT SHOWS 

7715
04:05:27,412 --> 04:05:28,013
THAT THEY'VE INTERVIEWED TWO 

7716
04:05:28,013 --> 04:05:30,916
PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY WERE THE 

7717
04:05:30,916 --> 04:05:32,984
ONES WHO ACTUALLY ASSAULTED 

7718
04:05:32,984 --> 04:05:33,184
YOU. 

7719
04:05:33,184 --> 04:05:37,889
I'M ASKING YOU TO ADDRESS THIS 

7720
04:05:37,889 --> 04:05:38,990
NEW DEFENSE OF MISTAKEN

IDENTITY DIRECTLY. 

7722
04:05:39,423 --> 04:05:42,027
DR. FORD, WITH WHAT DEGREE OF 

7723
04:05:42,027 --> 04:05:48,700
CERTAINTY DO YOU BELIEVE BRETT 

7724
04:05:48,700 --> 04:05:50,501
KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED YOU? 

7725
04:05:50,501 --> 04:05:50,768
>> 100%. 

7726
04:05:50,768 --> 04:05:51,035
>> 100%. 

7727
04:05:51,035 --> 04:05:54,239
>> SINCERE AND THOROUGH 

7728
04:05:54,239 --> 04:05:56,007
INVESTIGATION IS CRITICAL TO 

7729
04:05:56,007 --> 04:05:58,076
THESE CLAIMS IN A PROSECUTOR'S 

7730
04:05:58,076 --> 04:05:58,309
WORLD. 

7731
04:05:58,309 --> 04:05:59,911
IT MAY BE THE MOST BASIC THING 

7732
04:05:59,911 --> 04:06:02,080
THAT WE OWE A VICTIM OR A 

7733
04:06:02,080 --> 04:06:04,716
WITNESS COMING FORWARD IS TO 

7734
04:06:04,716 --> 04:06:06,985
MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE THEM A 

7735
04:06:06,985 --> 04:06:08,053
FULL THOROUGH AND SINCERE 

7736
04:06:08,053 --> 04:06:08,420
INVESTIGATION. 

7737
04:06:08,420 --> 04:06:10,889
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 

7738
04:06:10,889 --> 04:06:12,491
OBSTRUCTION FROM THE OTHER 

7739
04:06:12,491 --> 04:06:12,691
SIDE. 

7740
04:06:12,691 --> 04:06:14,493
I CANNOT LET IT GO BY WHAT 

7741
04:06:14,493 --> 04:06:17,095
YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY SO MANY 

7742
04:06:17,095 --> 04:06:19,431
TIMES THAT BETWEEN JULY 30th 

7743
04:06:19,431 --> 04:06:20,632
AND SEPTEMBER 13th THERE WERE 

7744
04:06:20,632 --> 04:06:23,869
45 DAYS THIS COMMITTEE COULD 

7745
04:06:23,869 --> 04:06:25,871
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS 

7746
04:06:25,871 --> 04:06:29,374
SITUATION AND HER PRIVACY WOULD 

7747
04:06:29,374 --> 04:06:29,841
HAVE BEEN PROTECTED. 

7748
04:06:29,841 --> 04:06:31,810
>> DID YOU SHOW A FULL OR 

7749
04:06:31,810 --> 04:06:37,482
PARTIAL SET OF THOSE MARRIAGE 

7750
04:06:37,482 --> 04:06:38,984
THERAPY RECORDS TO THE 

7751
04:06:38,984 --> 04:06:40,318
"WASHINGTON POST"? 

7752
04:06:40,318 --> 04:06:41,352
>> I DON'T REMEMBER. 

7753
04:06:41,352 --> 04:06:42,587
I REMEMBER SUMMARIZING FOR HER 

7754
04:06:42,587 --> 04:06:43,955
WHAT THEY SAID, SO I'M NOT 

7755
04:06:43,955 --> 04:06:49,060
QUITE SURE IF I ACTUALLY GAVE 

7756
04:06:49,060 --> 04:06:49,761
HER THE RECORD. 

7757
04:06:49,761 --> 04:06:50,028
>> OKAY. 

7758
04:06:50,028 --> 04:06:53,865
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE 

7759
04:06:53,865 --> 04:06:55,300
REPORTER DID NOT SEE THESE 

7760
04:06:55,300 --> 04:06:55,634
NOTES. 

7761
04:06:55,634 --> 04:06:57,035
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE -- I 

7762
04:06:57,035 --> 04:06:57,969
CAN'T RECALL WHETHER SHE SAW 

7763
04:06:57,969 --> 04:07:01,807
THEM DIRECTLY OR IF I JUST TOLD 

7764
04:07:01,807 --> 04:07:02,707
HER WHAT THEY SAID. 

7765
04:07:02,707 --> 04:07:05,977
>> HAVE YOU SHOWN THEM TO 

7766
04:07:05,977 --> 04:07:08,647
ANYONE ELSE BESIDES YOUR 

7767
04:07:08,647 --> 04:07:08,914
COUNSEL? 

7768
04:07:08,914 --> 04:07:09,414
>> JUST THE COUNSEL. 

7769
04:07:09,414 --> 04:07:10,248
>> OKAY. 

7770
04:07:10,248 --> 04:07:11,850
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT 

7771
04:07:11,850 --> 04:07:13,718
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NAME IS NOT 

7772
04:07:13,718 --> 04:07:14,252
LISTED IN THOSE NOTE? 

7773
04:07:14,252 --> 04:07:16,988
>> HIS NAME IS NOT LISTED IN 

7774
04:07:16,988 --> 04:07:17,321
THOSE NOTES. 

7775
04:07:17,321 --> 04:07:18,857
>> IS IT ALSO FAIR TO SAY TO 

7776
04:07:18,857 --> 04:07:20,725
SAY THE THERAPY'S NOTES THAT 

7777
04:07:20,725 --> 04:07:22,027
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SAY 

7778
04:07:22,027 --> 04:07:23,094
THERE -- THERAPIST'S NOTES THAT 

7779
04:07:23,094 --> 04:07:23,995
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SAY 

7780
04:07:23,995 --> 04:07:26,865
THERE WERE FOUR BOYS IN THE 

7781
04:07:26,865 --> 04:07:27,065
ROOM? 

7782
04:07:27,065 --> 04:07:29,434
>> IT DESCRIBES THE SEXUAL 

7783
04:07:29,434 --> 04:07:32,070
ASSAULT, AND IT SAYS 

7784
04:07:32,070 --> 04:07:34,039
ERRONEOUSLY BY FOUR BOYS SO THE 

7785
04:07:34,039 --> 04:07:34,940
THERAPIST GOT THE CONTENT OF IT 

7786
04:07:34,940 --> 04:07:35,173
WRONG. 

7787
04:07:35,173 --> 04:07:39,077
>> AND YOU CORRECTED THAT TO 

7788
04:07:39,077 --> 04:07:40,144
THE "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER, 

7789
04:07:40,144 --> 04:07:40,411
CORRECT? 

7790
04:07:40,411 --> 04:07:40,712
>> CORRECT. 

7791
04:07:40,712 --> 04:07:41,379
>> IN YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE 

7792
04:07:41,379 --> 04:07:42,881
"WASHINGTON POST," YOU SAID 

7793
04:07:42,881 --> 04:07:45,750
THAT YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND 

7794
04:07:45,750 --> 04:07:47,318
EARLY IN YOUR MARRIAGE YOU HAD 

7795
04:07:47,318 --> 04:07:48,953
[ NO AUDIO  ] PHYSICAL ABUSE. 

7796
04:07:48,953 --> 04:07:50,255
IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT 

7797
04:07:50,255 --> 04:07:53,024
BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED YOU 

7798
04:07:53,024 --> 04:07:55,360
TOLD HIM THAT YOU HAD 

7799
04:07:55,360 --> 04:07:56,227
EXPERIENCED, QUOTE, A SEXUAL 

7800
04:07:56,227 --> 04:07:56,494
ASSAULT. 

7801
04:07:56,494 --> 04:08:00,131
DO THESE TWO THINGS REFER TO 

7802
04:08:00,131 --> 04:08:00,698
THE SAME INCIDENT? 

7803
04:08:00,698 --> 04:08:01,066
>> YES. 

7804
04:08:01,066 --> 04:08:05,003
>> AND AT EITHER POINT ON THESE 

7805
04:08:05,003 --> 04:08:08,573
TWO TIMES DID YOU USE ANY 

7806
04:08:08,573 --> 04:08:08,806
NAMES? 

7807
04:08:08,806 --> 04:08:10,308
>> NO. 

7808
04:08:10,308 --> 04:08:11,409
>> IT'S BEEN REPORTED BY THE 

7809
04:08:11,409 --> 04:08:13,378
PRESS THAT YOU WOULD NOT SUBMIT 

7810
04:08:13,378 --> 04:08:15,347
TO AN INTERVIEW WITH THE 

7811
04:08:15,347 --> 04:08:17,482
COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF YOUR FEAR 

7812
04:08:17,482 --> 04:08:18,449
OF FLYING, IS THAT TRUE? 

7813
04:08:18,449 --> 04:08:21,252
>> WELL, I WAS WILLING -- I WAS 

7814
04:08:21,252 --> 04:08:23,021
HOPING THAT THEY WOULD COME TO 

7815
04:08:23,021 --> 04:08:25,123
ME, BUT THEN REALIZED THAT WAS 

7816
04:08:25,123 --> 04:08:25,990
AN UNREALISTIC REQUEST. 

7817
04:08:25,990 --> 04:08:28,626
>> I ALSO SAW ON YOUR C.V. 

7818
04:08:28,626 --> 04:08:30,095
THAT YOU LIST THE FOLLOWING 

7819
04:08:30,095 --> 04:08:33,632
INTERESTS OF SURF TRAVEL AND 

7820
04:08:33,632 --> 04:08:35,166
YOU IN PARENTHESIS PUT HAWAII,

COSTA RICA, SOUTH PACIFIC 

7822
04:08:37,235 --> 04:08:37,868
ISLANDS AND FRENCH POLYNESIA. 

7823
04:08:37,868 --> 04:08:40,438
HAVE YOU BEEN ALL TO THOSE 

7824
04:08:40,438 --> 04:08:40,671
PLACES? 

7825
04:08:40,671 --> 04:08:40,971
>> CORRECT. 

7826
04:08:40,971 --> 04:08:41,339
>> BY AIRPLANE? 

7827
04:08:41,339 --> 04:08:41,605
>> YES. 

7828
04:08:41,605 --> 04:08:45,977
>> NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT 

7829
04:08:45,977 --> 04:08:47,379
YOU'VE TAKEN A POLYGRAPH TEST, 

7830
04:08:47,379 --> 04:08:48,880
DR. FORD, THAT FOUND YOU WERE 

7831
04:08:48,880 --> 04:08:49,880
BEING TRUTHFUL WHEN YOU 

7832
04:08:49,880 --> 04:08:50,548
DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. 

7833
04:08:50,548 --> 04:08:55,553
CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU DECIDED 

7834
04:08:55,553 --> 04:08:56,721
TO TAKE THAT TEST? 

7835
04:08:56,721 --> 04:08:58,890
>> I WAS MEETING WITH 

7836
04:08:58,890 --> 04:08:59,190
ATTORNEYS. 

7837
04:08:59,190 --> 04:09:00,792
I WAS INTERVIEWING VARIOUS 

7838
04:09:00,792 --> 04:09:01,392
ATTORNEYS, AND THE ATTORNEYS 

7839
04:09:01,392 --> 04:09:04,996
ASKED IF I WAS WILLING TO TAKE 

7840
04:09:04,996 --> 04:09:06,331
IT, AND I SAID ABSOLUTELY. 

7841
04:09:06,331 --> 04:09:08,867
THAT SAID, IT WAS ALMOST AS 

7842
04:09:08,867 --> 04:09:11,036
ANXIETY PROVOKING AS AN 

7843
04:09:11,036 --> 04:09:11,436
AIRPLANE FLIGHT. 

7844
04:09:11,436 --> 04:09:15,006
>> IF WE AGREE ON NOTHING ELSE 

7845
04:09:15,006 --> 04:09:17,709
TODAY, I HOPE ON A BIPARTISAN 

7846
04:09:17,709 --> 04:09:21,579
BASIS WE CAN AGREE ON HOW MUCH 

7847
04:09:21,579 --> 04:09:22,781
COURAGE IT HAS TAKEN FOR YOU TO 

7848
04:09:22,781 --> 04:09:31,288
COME FORWARD, AND I THINK YOU 

7849
04:09:31,288 --> 04:09:35,026
HAVE EARNED AMERICA'S 

7850
04:09:35,026 --> 04:09:38,262
GRATITUDE. 

7851
04:09:38,262 --> 04:09:39,431
>> HELLO, EVERYONE, I'M TANYA

BRETT KAVANAUGH, WE ARE GOING

04:09:50,275 --> 04:09:53,111
TO WEIGH IN WITH CAITLIN HUEY 

7860

04:10:00,218 --> 04:10:02,320
LADIES, THANKS SO MUCH FOR 

7866
04:10:02,320 --> 04:10:02,687
BEING WITH US. 

7867
04:10:02,687 --> 04:10:03,488
WE'VE ALL BEEN LISTENING 

7868
04:10:03,488 --> 04:10:05,357
CAREFULLY TO DR. FORD'S 

7869
04:10:05,357 --> 04:10:05,890
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING. 

7870
04:10:05,890 --> 04:10:08,493
LET'S START OFF BY TALKING 

7871
04:10:08,493 --> 04:10:09,160
ABOUT HOW SHE'S COMING ACROSS. 

7872
04:10:09,160 --> 04:10:12,697
CAITLIN, LET ME START WITH YOU. 

7873
04:10:12,697 --> 04:10:13,965
IS SHE COMING ACROSS AS 

7874
04:10:13,965 --> 04:10:14,599
BELIEVABLE, CREDIBLE AND 

7875
04:10:14,599 --> 04:10:14,932
SYMPATHETIC? 

7876
04:10:14,932 --> 04:10:16,468
>> SO FAR SHE IS COMING ACROSS 

7877
04:10:16,468 --> 04:10:18,103
AS A COMPELLING WITNESS IN THIS 

7878
04:10:18,103 --> 04:10:19,404
CASE, AND WHAT'S REALLY 

7879
04:10:19,404 --> 04:10:22,907
INTERESTING TO ME ARE A COUPLE 

7880
04:10:22,907 --> 04:10:23,608
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. 

7881
04:10:23,608 --> 04:10:27,679
FIRST, SHE'S REFERRING TO HER 

7882
04:10:27,679 --> 04:10:29,948
OWN BACKGROUND AS A PSYCHOLOGY 

7883
04:10:29,948 --> 04:10:30,915
PROFESSOR IN REFERENCING IN 

7884
04:10:30,915 --> 04:10:31,783
PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS AND 

7885
04:10:31,783 --> 04:10:34,051
SCIENTIFIC TERMS, I SHOULD SAY, 

7886
04:10:34,051 --> 04:10:35,353
WHAT IT MEANS TO REMEMBER SOME 

7887
04:10:35,353 --> 04:10:37,121
THINGS AND NOT TO REMEMBER 

7888
04:10:37,121 --> 04:10:37,454
OTHER THINGS. 

7889
04:10:37,454 --> 04:10:39,224
ANOTHER HEADLINE THAT REALLY 

7890
04:10:39,224 --> 04:10:42,393
STOOD OUT TO ME WAS HER MEMORY 

7891
04:10:42,393 --> 04:10:44,195
OF THE LAUGHTER, TRYING TO MAKE 

7892
04:10:44,195 --> 04:10:46,131
CLEAR THAT SHE MAY NOT REMEMBER 

7893
04:10:46,131 --> 04:10:47,532
ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES 

7894
04:10:47,532 --> 04:10:49,434
SURROUNDING THAT EVENT, BUT SHE 

7895
04:10:49,434 --> 04:10:50,902
REMEMBERS A COUPLE OF THEM 

7896
04:10:50,902 --> 04:10:53,104
QUITE CLEARLY, ONE THE ASSAULT 

7897
04:10:53,104 --> 04:10:53,872
AND ONE THE LAUGHTER THAT 

7898
04:10:53,872 --> 04:10:56,007
ENSUED AFTER, AND I THINK THAT 

7899
04:10:56,007 --> 04:10:57,709
LINE IS REALLY GOING TO 

7900
04:10:57,709 --> 04:10:59,076
RESONATE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE 

7901
04:10:59,076 --> 04:11:00,311
WATCHING THIS. 

7902
04:11:00,311 --> 04:11:01,913
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, 

7903
04:11:01,913 --> 04:11:02,513
HONESTLY, HEARING THAT LINE 

7904
04:11:02,513 --> 04:11:04,582
JUST MADE MY STOMACH FALL AS 

7905
04:11:04,582 --> 04:11:04,782
WELL. 

7906
04:11:04,782 --> 04:11:05,483
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 

7907
04:11:05,483 --> 04:11:07,685
IDEA THAT YOU CAN BE ASSAULTED 

7908
04:11:07,685 --> 04:11:09,754
AND PEOPLE ARE ENJOYING IT AS 

7909
04:11:09,754 --> 04:11:12,490
IT'S HAPPENING THAT I THINK ANY 

7910
04:11:12,490 --> 04:11:14,459
WOMAN OR ANY PERSON WOULD 

7911
04:11:14,459 --> 04:11:14,959
CRINGE HEARING THAT. 

7912
04:11:14,959 --> 04:11:15,826
LESLIE, WOULD YOU AGREE? 

7913
04:11:15,826 --> 04:11:17,095
>> IT'S DEFINITELY THE CRUEL 

7914
04:11:17,095 --> 04:11:18,296
PART OF ALMOST TWISTING THE 

7915
04:11:18,296 --> 04:11:21,733
KNIFE, AND I THINK THAT'S THE 

7916
04:11:21,733 --> 04:11:25,804
PART THAT WAS CRINGE WORTHY AND 

7917
04:11:25,804 --> 04:11:26,271
EXTREMELY BELIEVABLE. 

7918
04:11:26,271 --> 04:11:29,107
AND SHE IS NOT ONLY COMPELLING 

7919
04:11:29,107 --> 04:11:32,377
AS A WITNESS, BUT ALSO AS A 

7920
04:11:32,377 --> 04:11:34,746
MOM, AS SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY 

7921
04:11:34,746 --> 04:11:35,079
APPROACHABLE. 

7922
04:11:35,079 --> 04:11:36,281
HER CADENCE, HER WORD CHOICE IS 

7923
04:11:36,281 --> 04:11:38,917
VERY -- NOT -- IT'S SOMETHING 

7924
04:11:38,917 --> 04:11:39,951
THAT'S VERY ACCESSIBLE. 

7925
04:11:39,951 --> 04:11:43,921
SHE'S NOT TRYING TO PUT ON AIR. 

7926
04:11:43,921 --> 04:11:45,889
SHE IS VERY MUCH TRYING TO 

7927
04:11:45,889 --> 04:11:46,824
ACCOMMODATE THE SENATORS. 

7928
04:11:46,824 --> 04:11:47,125
>> RIGHT. 

7929
04:11:47,125 --> 04:11:48,826
>> AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S 

7930
04:11:48,826 --> 04:11:50,194
UNUSUAL AOUT IT. 

7931
04:11:50,194 --> 04:11:53,131
YOU USUALLY SEE THIS KIND OF 

7932
04:11:53,131 --> 04:11:54,232
CONSTANT ATTENTION. 

7933
04:11:54,232 --> 04:11:55,199
SHE'S HAS NO ATTENTION. 

7934
04:11:55,199 --> 04:11:56,301
SHE'S ABOUT COLLABORATIVE TRUTH 

7935
04:11:56,301 --> 04:11:56,568
TELLING. 

7936
04:11:56,568 --> 04:11:57,569
>> AND SHE'S ALSO NOT COMING 

7937
04:11:57,569 --> 04:11:59,003
ACROSS AS TRAINED WHICH IS 

7938
04:11:59,003 --> 04:12:01,906
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF 

7939
04:12:01,906 --> 04:12:02,439
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 

7940
04:12:02,439 --> 04:12:03,041
PERHAPS ACCUSING HER OF, 

7941
04:12:03,041 --> 04:12:05,310
SOMEHOW COMING FORWARD AT THE 

7942
04:12:05,310 --> 04:12:06,778
BEHEST OF OTHER, RIGHT? 

7943
04:12:06,778 --> 04:12:07,045
>> RIGHT. 

7944
04:12:07,045 --> 04:12:09,881
THAT SHE WAS SOME SORT OF A 

7945
04:12:09,881 --> 04:12:11,749
PAID OR INFLUENCED DEMOCRATIC 

7946
04:12:11,749 --> 04:12:13,651
OPERATIVE WHO WAS CONDITIONED 

7947
04:12:13,651 --> 04:12:14,586
OR TRAINED BY HER COUNSEL OR 

7948
04:12:14,586 --> 04:12:15,954
DEMOCRATIC STAFF, AND THEY'RE 

7949
04:12:15,954 --> 04:12:17,355
GOING TO HAVE A VERY HARD TIME 

7950
04:12:17,355 --> 04:12:18,923
PROVING THAT THAT WOULD BE THE 

7951
04:12:18,923 --> 04:12:19,123
CASE. 

7952
04:12:19,123 --> 04:12:20,758
>> AND ESPECIALLY SINCE, YOU 

7953
04:12:20,758 --> 04:12:21,358
KNOW, SHE'S TALKED ABOUT THE 

7954
04:12:21,358 --> 04:12:25,130
WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS SUCH A 

7955
04:12:25,130 --> 04:12:27,465
RELUCTANT WITNESS, THAT SHE HAD 

7956
04:12:27,465 --> 04:12:29,033
PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION FIRST 

7957
04:12:29,033 --> 04:12:30,735
ANONYMOUSLY AND, SECOND, WHICH 

7958
04:12:30,735 --> 04:12:31,436
IS REALLY IMPORTANT BEFORE 

7959
04:12:31,436 --> 04:12:32,937
KAVANAUGH WAS EVEN CHOSEN AS 

7960
04:12:32,937 --> 04:12:34,572
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 

7961
04:12:34,572 --> 04:12:37,075
SHE BROUGHT THIS UP TO HER 

7962
04:12:37,075 --> 04:12:38,910
CONGRESSWOMAN ANONYMOUSLY WHILE 

7963
04:12:38,910 --> 04:12:41,112
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS LISTED 

7964
04:12:41,112 --> 04:12:42,247
AMONG MANY QUALIFIED JUDGES IN 

7965
04:12:42,247 --> 04:12:42,547
THIS CASE. 

7966
04:12:42,547 --> 04:12:43,181
AND ALSO SHE TALKED ABOUT THE 

7967
04:12:43,181 --> 04:12:44,849
WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS TALKING 

7968
04:12:44,849 --> 04:12:47,552
WITH HER FRIENDS ON THE BEACH 

7969
04:12:47,552 --> 04:12:48,586
ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED WITH THIS, 

7970
04:12:48,586 --> 04:12:50,421
WASN'T SURE IF SHE SHOULD HIRE 

7971
04:12:50,421 --> 04:12:50,755
A LAWYER. 

7972
04:12:50,755 --> 04:12:52,323
SO TO YOUR POINT, YOU KNOW, 

7973
04:12:52,323 --> 04:12:54,158
SHE'S TRYING TO PRESENT HERSELF 

7974
04:12:54,158 --> 04:12:56,227
AS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT POLITICAL, 

7975
04:12:56,227 --> 04:12:57,128
EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN 

7976
04:12:57,128 --> 04:12:58,696
PEOPLE WHO -- AND LAWMAKERS WHO 

7977
04:12:58,696 --> 04:13:01,698
ARE SEIZING ON THIS TO ADVANCE 

7978
04:13:01,698 --> 04:13:03,468
THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDA. 

7979
04:13:03,468 --> 04:13:04,969
>> WHAT'S VERY PARTICULAR AND 

7980
04:13:04,969 --> 04:13:06,037
INTERESTING IS HOW AUTHENTIC 

7981
04:13:06,037 --> 04:13:08,106
SHE IS ABOUT TAKING YOU BACK TO 

7982
04:13:08,106 --> 04:13:09,507
THAT MOMENT IN TIME WHERE SHE 

7983
04:13:09,507 --> 04:13:10,408
SAYS SHE WASN'T FULLY DEVELOPED 

7984
04:13:10,408 --> 04:13:12,977
AS AN ADULT AND HER BRAIN WAS 

7985
04:13:12,977 --> 04:13:13,277
DEVELOPING. 

7986
04:13:13,277 --> 04:13:15,747
BUT IF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS 

7987
04:13:15,747 --> 04:13:16,614
AN UNDERAGED CATHOLIC PRIVATE 

7988
04:13:16,614 --> 04:13:19,017
SCHOOL BOY WHO WAS AT A PARTY 

7989
04:13:19,017 --> 04:13:20,618
WITH BOYS THAT WAS UNSUPERVISED 

7990
04:13:20,618 --> 04:13:21,719
AND YOU'RE DRINKING BEER -- 

7991
04:13:21,719 --> 04:13:22,921
>> YOU'RE ALREADY FEELING 

7992
04:13:22,921 --> 04:13:25,790
GUILTY ABOUT BEING IN THE ROOM. 

7993
04:13:25,790 --> 04:13:26,057
>> HELLO. 

7994
04:13:26,057 --> 04:13:26,490
I'M ALREADY GUILTY. 

7995
04:13:26,490 --> 04:13:29,127
SO THE IDEA THAT SHE'S GOING TO 

7996
04:13:29,127 --> 04:13:29,994
COME FORWARD AND IMMEDIATELY 

7997
04:13:29,994 --> 04:13:31,029
TELL HER PAIRMENTS THAT SHE 

7998
04:13:31,029 --> 04:13:32,129
MADE A POOR CHOICE TO PUT 

7999
04:13:32,129 --> 04:13:33,231
HERSELF IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, 

8000
04:13:33,231 --> 04:13:34,666
AND THAT'S PART OF THE SHAME 

8001
04:13:34,666 --> 04:13:35,266
CULTURE WE TALK ABOUT. 

8002
04:13:35,266 --> 04:13:35,533
>> RIGHT. 

8003
04:13:35,533 --> 04:13:37,434
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS IS 

8004
04:13:37,434 --> 04:13:38,869
THE EARLY '80s WHERE I DON'T 

8005
04:13:38,869 --> 04:13:40,638
THINK EVEN THE WORD DATE RAPE 

8006
04:13:40,638 --> 04:13:41,639
HAD BEEN COINED YET, RIGHT? 

8007
04:13:41,639 --> 04:13:42,106
>> NOT AT ALL. 

8008
04:13:42,106 --> 04:13:43,875
THERE WAS NOT A PHONE NUMBER 

8009
04:13:43,875 --> 04:13:47,011
YOU COULD CALL THAT WAS SO 

8010
04:13:47,011 --> 04:13:47,578
PREVALENT AND AVAILABLE. 

8011
04:13:47,578 --> 04:13:49,881
WHO WOULD SHE HAVE CALLED OR 

8012
04:13:49,881 --> 04:13:51,615
WHO WOULD SHE HAVE TRUSTED? 

8013
04:13:51,615 --> 04:13:54,052
IF YOU GO TO YOUR CLERGY, IT'S 

8014
04:13:54,052 --> 04:13:54,919
STILL A FLAWED CHOICE YOU MADE. 

8015
04:13:54,919 --> 04:13:57,021
SO FOR HER TO DEAL WITH THAT, 

8016
04:13:57,021 --> 04:13:58,356
TO PRESENT IT -- AND THAT'S 

8017
04:13:58,356 --> 04:14:01,358
PROBABLY WHY SHE WANTED TO KEEP 

8018
04:14:01,358 --> 04:14:03,193
IT VERY PRIVATE AS WELL. 

8019
04:14:03,193 --> 04:14:04,228
IN CONSCIENCE, YOU KNOW THAT 

8020
04:14:04,228 --> 04:14:05,830
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DOP, BUT 

8021
04:14:05,830 --> 04:14:07,799
YOU DON'T NECESSARY -- NEEDS TO 

8022
04:14:07,799 --> 04:14:08,800
BE DONE, BUT YOU DON'T 

8023
04:14:08,800 --> 04:14:10,968
NECESSARILY WANT TO EXPOSE 

8024
04:14:10,968 --> 04:14:11,735
EVERYTHING DU IN THAT 

8025
04:14:11,735 --> 04:14:12,036
SITUATION. 

8026
04:14:12,036 --> 04:14:13,338
>> LESLIE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 

8027
04:14:13,338 --> 04:14:15,539
THE GOP'S CHOICE OF HAVING THIS 

8028
04:14:15,539 --> 04:14:16,106
PROSECUTOR QUESTIONING DR. 

8029
04:14:16,106 --> 04:14:16,306
FORD? 

8030
04:14:16,306 --> 04:14:17,375
DO YOU THINK THAT IS WORKING 

8031
04:14:17,375 --> 04:14:19,544
OUT FOR THEM, DO YOU THINK IT'S 

8032
04:14:19,544 --> 04:14:22,680
MAKING IT LOOK TOO MUCH LIKE 

8033
04:14:22,680 --> 04:14:23,413
DR. FORD IS ON TRIAL? 

8034
04:14:23,413 --> 04:14:23,947
WHAT'S YOUR PERCEPTION? 

8035
04:14:23,947 --> 04:14:25,550
>> THE INTERESTING PART OF THE 

8036
04:14:25,550 --> 04:14:27,552
PROSECUTOR WHO IS KNOWN AS 

8037
04:14:27,552 --> 04:14:28,820
SOMEBODY WHO SUPPORTS VICTIMS' 

8038
04:14:28,820 --> 04:14:29,921
RIGHTS, YOU CAN TELL AFTER THE 

8039
04:14:29,921 --> 04:14:31,322
TESTIMONY, SHE WAS MUCH 

8040
04:14:31,322 --> 04:14:32,423
STRONGER BEFORE, KIND OF 

8041
04:14:32,423 --> 04:14:33,724
CLARIFYING, BUT ONCE DR. FORD 

8042
04:14:33,724 --> 04:14:35,426
GAVE THAT TESTIMONY, SHE'S NOW 

8043
04:14:35,426 --> 04:14:37,528
KIND OF IN THE WEEDS. 

8044
04:14:37,528 --> 04:14:38,496
SHE'S OVER THERE TALKING ABOUT 

8045
04:14:38,496 --> 04:14:40,131
INNOCUOUS THINGS AND FLIGHTS 

8046
04:14:40,131 --> 04:14:43,868
AND POKE HOLES IN OTHER ASPECTS 

8047
04:14:43,868 --> 04:14:46,738
THAT DON'T SEEM GERMANE TO THE 

8048
04:14:46,738 --> 04:14:47,071
ACTUAL SNEPT. 

8049
04:14:47,071 --> 04:14:48,606
SHE'S NOT -- ACTUAL INCIDENT. 

8050
04:14:48,606 --> 04:14:49,474
SHE'S NOT QUESTIONING IN 

8051
04:14:49,474 --> 04:14:50,074
GREATER DETAIL THE ACTUAL 

8052
04:14:50,074 --> 04:14:52,977
ASSAULT WHICH IS GOING TO BE A 

8053
04:14:52,977 --> 04:14:53,678
VERY BIG CONTRAST WHEN 

8054
04:14:53,678 --> 04:14:54,211
KAVANAUGH COMES FORWARD. 

8055
04:14:54,211 --> 04:14:55,680
>> DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING 

8056
04:14:55,680 --> 04:14:58,316
SOMEWHERE WITH ALL OF THIS? 

8057
04:14:58,316 --> 04:14:58,916
IS SHE PIECING SOMETHING 

8058
04:14:58,916 --> 04:14:59,183
TOGETHER? 

8059
04:14:59,183 --> 04:15:01,419
>> YOU KNOW, THE TWEETS THAT 

8060
04:15:01,419 --> 04:15:02,920
SHE'S HIRED -- THAT SHE'S HIRED 

8061
04:15:02,920 --> 04:15:04,788
BY THE DEMOCRATS, SHE'S NOT 

8062
04:15:04,788 --> 04:15:05,255
HELPING REPUBLICANS. 

8063
04:15:05,255 --> 04:15:09,627
I REALLY WONDER AT THIS POINT 

8064
04:15:09,627 --> 04:15:13,197
IT IS NOT COMPELLING, IF 

8065
04:15:13,197 --> 04:15:13,797
ANYTHING, IT'S EMBOLDING. 

8066
04:15:13,797 --> 04:15:17,068
>> I ALSO WANT TO BRING IN CBSN 

8067
04:15:17,068 --> 04:15:18,369
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 

8068
04:15:18,369 --> 04:15:19,070
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST LINDA 

8069
04:15:19,070 --> 04:15:19,537
TRAN. 

8070
04:15:19,537 --> 04:15:21,205
SHE'S ALSO A FOUNDER PARTNER OF 

8071
04:15:21,205 --> 04:15:23,040
270 STRATEGIES. 

8072
04:15:23,040 --> 04:15:23,674
SHE JOINS US FROM WASHINGTON. 

8073
04:15:23,674 --> 04:15:25,009
LINDA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 

8074
04:15:25,009 --> 04:15:25,376
BEING WITH US. 

8075
04:15:25,376 --> 04:15:27,578
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS 

8076
04:15:27,578 --> 04:15:29,647
MORNING'S TESTIMONY BY DR. 

8077
04:15:29,647 --> 04:15:29,847
FORD? 

8078
04:15:29,847 --> 04:15:31,316
>> YOU KNOW, TANYA, MY TAKE IS 

8079
04:15:31,316 --> 04:15:32,350
A LITTLE BIT SPLIT. 

8080
04:15:32,350 --> 04:15:33,985
SO ON THE ONE HAND I'M 

8081
04:15:33,985 --> 04:15:35,052
OBVIOUSLY A DEMOCRATIC 

8082
04:15:35,052 --> 04:15:36,988
STRATEGIST AND I'M VIEWING THIS 

8083
04:15:36,988 --> 04:15:38,923
THROUGH A POLITICAL LENS AS 

8084
04:15:38,923 --> 04:15:40,191
OTHERS ARE, BUT I'M SOMEBODY 

8085
04:15:40,191 --> 04:15:42,226
WHO HAS SURVIVED SEXUAL ASSAULT 

8086
04:15:42,226 --> 04:15:42,459
MYSELF. 

8087
04:15:42,459 --> 04:15:43,594
AND SO THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF 

8088
04:15:43,594 --> 04:15:46,931
THIS MORNING ON ME IS I THINK 

8089
04:15:46,931 --> 04:15:48,766
MUCH BROADER THAN THE POLITICAL 

8090
04:15:48,766 --> 04:15:49,767
VOLLEYING AND THE BACK AND 

8091
04:15:49,767 --> 04:15:51,836
FORTH THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A 

8092
04:15:51,836 --> 04:15:53,104
LOT TODAY. 

8093
04:15:53,104 --> 04:15:55,339
IT IS JUST AMAZING AND 

8094
04:15:55,339 --> 04:15:56,507
INSPIRING TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE 

8095
04:15:56,507 --> 04:15:58,142
DR. BLASEY FORD COME FORWARD, 

8096
04:15:58,142 --> 04:15:59,210
SHARE HER EXPERIENCE IN SO MUCH 

8097
04:15:59,210 --> 04:16:01,379
DETAIL, AND TO LIVE THAT TRAUMA 

8098
04:16:01,379 --> 04:16:03,147
ALL OVER AGAIN IN FRONT OF ALL 

8099
04:16:03,147 --> 04:16:05,817
OF AMERICA, ALL OF THE WORLD 

8100
04:16:05,817 --> 04:16:06,517
REALLY WATCHING. 

8101
04:16:06,517 --> 04:16:08,753
I THINK THAT HER TESTIMONY WAS 

8102
04:16:08,753 --> 04:16:09,153
DEEPLY POWERFUL. 

8103
04:16:09,153 --> 04:16:10,688
I THINK THAT -- THE FACT THAT 

8104
04:16:10,688 --> 04:16:12,390
SHE'S NOT ONLY SOMEBODY WHO IS 

8105
04:16:12,390 --> 04:16:14,625
A VICTIM AND A SURVIVOR, BUT 

8106
04:16:14,625 --> 04:16:15,626
ALSO SOMEBODY WHO HAS EXPERT 

8107
04:16:15,626 --> 04:16:17,161
TESTIMONY THAT SHE CAN PRESENT 

8108
04:16:17,161 --> 04:16:19,030
HERSELF WAS REALLY COMPELLING 

8109
04:16:19,030 --> 04:16:19,697
AND VERY, VERY CREDIBLE. 

8110
04:16:19,697 --> 04:16:20,665
>> WELL, LINDA, NUMBER ONE, 

8111
04:16:20,665 --> 04:16:22,366
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING 

8112
04:16:22,366 --> 04:16:22,933
FORWARD AS A SURVIVOR. 

8113
04:16:22,933 --> 04:16:27,004
I MEAN, THE MORE PEOPLE THAT 

8114
04:16:27,004 --> 04:16:29,373
COME FORWARD, THE MORE POWERFUL 

8115
04:16:29,373 --> 04:16:30,308
THE CHORUS IS. 

8116
04:16:30,308 --> 04:16:31,676
AND AS SOMEBODY WHO IS A 

8117
04:16:31,676 --> 04:16:33,277
SURVIVOR OF SOME SORT OF SEXUAL 

8118
04:16:33,277 --> 04:16:36,581
VIOLENCE, DID YOU PERCEIVE HER 

8119
04:16:36,581 --> 04:16:37,148
TESTIMONY AS BEING HONEST? 

8120
04:16:37,148 --> 04:16:37,515
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

8121
04:16:37,515 --> 04:16:38,950
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE 

8122
04:16:38,950 --> 04:16:41,118
STARTED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THERE 

8123
04:16:41,118 --> 04:16:42,587
WERE CERTAIN DETAILS THAT 

8124
04:16:42,587 --> 04:16:44,589
REALLY WERE SEARED INTO HER 

8125
04:16:44,589 --> 04:16:46,491
MEMORY AND THAT HAD COME BACK 

8126
04:16:46,491 --> 04:16:47,358
TO HAUNT HER PERIODICALLY AND 

8127
04:16:47,358 --> 04:16:48,626
AGAIN AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HER 

8128
04:16:48,626 --> 04:16:50,528
LIFE, THAT IS SOMETHIG THAT I 

8129
04:16:50,528 --> 04:16:53,698
THINK ANYBODY WHO'S LIVED 

8130
04:16:53,698 --> 04:16:54,565
THROUGH ASSAULT CAN RELATE TO. 

8131
04:16:54,565 --> 04:16:56,567
THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, A CERTAIN 

8132
04:16:56,567 --> 04:16:58,703
TOUCH, A CERTAIN SOUND THAT YOU 

8133
04:16:58,703 --> 04:17:00,638
HEARD, AN IMAGE THAT YOU KEPT 

8134
04:17:00,638 --> 04:17:01,706
HAVING NIGHTMARES ABOUT, THAT 

8135
04:17:01,706 --> 04:17:03,007
WILL NEVER, EVER LEAVE YOU NO 

8136
04:17:03,007 --> 04:17:04,242
MATTER HOW MUCH THERAPY YOU 

8137
04:17:04,242 --> 04:17:05,543
HAVE, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES 

8138
04:17:05,543 --> 04:17:06,544
YOU MAY HAVE DISCUSSED IT OR 

8139
04:17:06,544 --> 04:17:09,580
TRIED TO GRAPPLE WITH IT OVER 

8140
04:17:09,580 --> 04:17:10,981
THE YEARS SINCE IT'S HAPPENED. 

8141
04:17:10,981 --> 04:17:12,517
AND ALSO THE IDEA THAT THERE 

8142
04:17:12,517 --> 04:17:14,118
ARE CERTAIN OTHER THINGS THAT 

8143
04:17:14,118 --> 04:17:15,552
MAYBE WERE NOT AS PROMINENT IN 

8144
04:17:15,552 --> 04:17:17,088
HER MEMORY, I MEAN, THE TRUTH 

8145
04:17:17,088 --> 04:17:18,556
IS THAT IF YOU LIVE THROUGH AN 

8146
04:17:18,556 --> 04:17:20,258
INCIDENT LIKE THIS, IF YOU LIVE 

8147
04:17:20,258 --> 04:17:21,292
THROUGH AN ATTACK, THE ONLY 

8148
04:17:21,292 --> 04:17:22,927
THING YOU WISH YOU COULD DO IS 

8149
04:17:22,927 --> 04:17:23,761
FORGET ALL OF IT. 

8150
04:17:23,761 --> 04:17:25,830
YOU WISH YOU COULD GO BACK AND 

8151
04:17:25,830 --> 04:17:26,864
MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY. 

8152
04:17:26,864 --> 04:17:28,699
AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU 

8153
04:17:28,699 --> 04:17:30,868
JUST CAN'T GET AWAY FROM. 

8154
04:17:30,868 --> 04:17:34,539
SO I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS 

8155
04:17:34,539 --> 04:17:35,439
EXTREMELY HONEST, PAINFUL AND 

8156
04:17:35,439 --> 04:17:36,440
VERY TRAUMATIC FOR SOMEBODY 

8157
04:17:36,440 --> 04:17:37,542
ELSE WHO HAS LIVED THROUGH IT 

8158
04:17:37,542 --> 04:17:38,576
TO WATCH AS WELL. 

8159
04:17:38,576 --> 04:17:40,711
>> AND SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS 

8160
04:17:40,711 --> 04:17:42,747
AT RISK HERE THEN FOR THE 

8161
04:17:42,747 --> 04:17:43,080
REPUBLICANS? 

8162
04:17:43,080 --> 04:17:45,416
CLEARLY THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 

8163
04:17:45,416 --> 04:17:46,717
WOMEN OUT THERE WATCHING DR. 

8164
04:17:46,717 --> 04:17:47,752
FORD'S TESTIMONY, REACTING TO 

8165
04:17:47,752 --> 04:17:48,386
IT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT 

8166
04:17:48,386 --> 04:17:52,590
YOU HAVE, AND I THINK THAT WE 

8167
04:17:52,590 --> 04:17:52,890
HAVE HERE. 

8168
04:17:52,890 --> 04:17:54,091
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE? 

8169
04:17:54,091 --> 04:17:57,094
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT AT 

8170
04:17:57,094 --> 04:17:57,895
STAKE FOR REPUBLICANS BROADLY. 

8171
04:17:57,895 --> 04:18:00,298
ONE OF THE MORE RECENT POLLS 

8172
04:18:00,298 --> 04:18:01,765
THAT I'VE SEEN, I THINK MORNING 

8173
04:18:01,765 --> 04:18:04,268
CONSULT DID IT SHOWED THAT IN 

8174
04:18:04,268 --> 04:18:05,803
THE LAST FEW DAYS ALONE SUPPORT 

8175
04:18:05,803 --> 04:18:08,372
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SUPPORT 

8176
04:18:08,372 --> 04:18:10,074
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH HAVE 

8177
04:18:10,074 --> 04:18:10,908
DROPPED PRECIPITOUSLY AND 

8178
04:18:10,908 --> 04:18:12,209
THAT'S BEEN A STEADY TREND. 

8179
04:18:12,209 --> 04:18:13,711
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT SEEING 

8180
04:18:13,711 --> 04:18:16,347
THE TESTIMONY FROM DR. BLASEY 

8181
04:18:16,347 --> 04:18:17,848
FORD TODAY, HEARING MUCH MORE 

8182
04:18:17,848 --> 04:18:18,950
DETAIL ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 

8183
04:18:18,950 --> 04:18:21,819
ONLY GOING TO MAKE THE 

8184
04:18:21,819 --> 04:18:22,219
SITUATION WORSE. 

8185
04:18:22,219 --> 04:18:24,355
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU HAVE 

8186
04:18:24,355 --> 04:18:25,289
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE RUNNING IN 

8187
04:18:25,289 --> 04:18:27,825
EVEN RED STATES WHO OUGHT TO BE 

8188
04:18:27,825 --> 04:18:28,659
LOOKING OVER THEIR BACKS 

8189
04:18:28,659 --> 04:18:30,728
BECAUSE THEY'VE STOOD REALLY, 

8190
04:18:30,728 --> 04:18:32,864
REALLY STRONGLY BY KAVANAUGH, 

8191
04:18:32,864 --> 04:18:35,966
BY THIS NOMINATION AND HAVE 

8192
04:18:35,966 --> 04:18:36,901
FRANKLY TRIED TO SHAME AND 

8193
04:18:36,901 --> 04:18:38,035
IMPUGN DR. BLASEY FORD AS PART 

8194
04:18:38,035 --> 04:18:38,969
OF THAT ARGUMENT. 

8195
04:18:38,969 --> 04:18:40,204
AND THAT IS A VERY, VERY 

8196
04:18:40,204 --> 04:18:41,105
DANGEROUS THING FOR THEM AS 

8197
04:18:41,105 --> 04:18:42,607
THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING 

8198
04:18:42,607 --> 04:18:43,707
TO HAPPEN IN THE WEEKS TO COME. 

8199
04:18:43,707 --> 04:18:45,142
>> AND WE UNDERSTAND THE 

8200
04:18:45,142 --> 04:18:46,177
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WATCHING THE 

8201
04:18:46,177 --> 04:18:46,444
HEARINGS. 

8202
04:18:46,444 --> 04:18:48,112
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GET TO THIS 

8203
04:18:48,112 --> 04:18:49,080
ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY BECAUSE I 

8204
04:18:49,080 --> 04:18:52,350
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY THE 

8205
04:18:52,350 --> 04:18:54,085
CRUX OF THE MATTER HERE. 

8206
04:18:54,085 --> 04:18:55,786
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE, DR. FORD OR 

8207
04:18:55,786 --> 04:18:56,554
BRETT KAVANAUGH? 

8208
04:18:56,554 --> 04:19:00,324
AND I THINK THAT SO FAR DR. 

8209
04:19:00,324 --> 04:19:02,058
FORD IS COMING ACROSS AS 

8210
04:19:02,058 --> 04:19:02,526
IMMINENTLY CREDIBLE. 

8211
04:19:02,526 --> 04:19:04,295
I THINK THAT SO FAR JUDGE 

8212
04:19:04,295 --> 04:19:05,630
KAVANAUGH IS COMING ACROSS AS 

8213
04:19:05,630 --> 04:19:09,100
SLIGHTLY LESS SO WHEN HE TALKS 

8214
04:19:09,100 --> 04:19:11,035
ABOUT HIS PAST AS A TEENAGER 

8215
04:19:11,035 --> 04:19:12,803
AND AS A STUDENT AT YALE. 

8216
04:19:12,803 --> 04:19:16,440
WHAT DO WE NEED TO HEAR FROM 

8217
04:19:16,440 --> 04:19:18,409
HIM THAT WILL MAKE US BELIEVE 

8218
04:19:18,409 --> 04:19:21,278
IN HIM ONCE AGAIN IN TERMS OF 

8219
04:19:21,278 --> 04:19:22,212
HIS BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST? 

8220
04:19:22,212 --> 04:19:24,682
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT I DON'T 

8221
04:19:24,682 --> 04:19:26,250
THINK ANYONE BELIEVES HE WAS 

8222
04:19:26,250 --> 04:19:29,152
QUITE THE CHOIR BOY THAT HE 

8223
04:19:29,152 --> 04:19:30,688
WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO BELIEVE. 

8224
04:19:30,688 --> 04:19:30,921
LYNDA. 

8225
04:19:30,921 --> 04:19:32,957
>> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S 

8226
04:19:32,957 --> 04:19:33,724
EXACTLY RIGHT, TANYA. 

8227
04:19:33,724 --> 04:19:35,860
HE'S IN A TOUGH SPOT, HONESTLY, 

8228
04:19:35,860 --> 04:19:38,629
HE REALLY IS BECAUSE HIS 

8229
04:19:38,629 --> 04:19:39,830
DEFENSE HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN TO 

8230
04:19:39,830 --> 04:19:40,363
CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT 

8231
04:19:40,363 --> 04:19:42,900
ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ACCUSED 

8232
04:19:42,900 --> 04:19:45,635
OF HIM HAS EVER HAPPENED. 

8233
04:19:45,635 --> 04:19:48,673
WE'VE JUST SPENT SEVERAL HOURS 

8234
04:19:48,673 --> 04:19:49,640
HEARING IN EXCRUCIATINGLY 

8235
04:19:49,640 --> 04:19:51,242
PAINFUL DETAIL THE ALLEGATIONS 

8236
04:19:51,242 --> 04:19:53,911
THAT DR. BLASEY FORD HAS LEVIED 

8237
04:19:53,911 --> 04:19:54,912
AGAINST HIM AND SHE'S COME 

8238
04:19:54,912 --> 04:19:55,412
ACROSS EXTRAORDINARILY 

8239
04:19:55,412 --> 04:19:55,813
CREDIBLE. 

8240
04:19:55,813 --> 04:19:58,583
AND FOR HIM TO SIT THERE AND 

8241
04:19:58,583 --> 04:19:59,383
SAY NONE OF THIS HAPPENED, 

8242
04:19:59,383 --> 04:20:00,818
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY LYING IS NOT 

8243
04:20:00,818 --> 04:20:01,652
GOING TO COME ACROSS VERY WELL. 

8244
04:20:01,652 --> 04:20:02,786
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE MANY 

8245
04:20:02,786 --> 04:20:04,121
DETAILS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM 

8246
04:20:04,121 --> 04:20:05,156
OTHER ACCUSATIONS WHICH MAY OR 

8247
04:20:05,156 --> 04:20:06,957
MAY NOT BE TRUE, WE HAVE TO PUT 

8248
04:20:06,957 --> 04:20:08,259
THAT OUT THERE, BUT OTHER 

8249
04:20:08,259 --> 04:20:10,861
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 

8250
04:20:10,861 --> 04:20:12,963
LEVIED AGAINST HIM, THE 

8251
04:20:12,963 --> 04:20:13,764
NARRATIVE THAT WE'VE HEARD AND 

8252
04:20:13,764 --> 04:20:15,399
ANECDOTES FROM STORIES THAT HIS 

8253
04:20:15,399 --> 04:20:16,534
FRIEND MARK JUDGE HAVE WRITTEN, 

8254
04:20:16,534 --> 04:20:19,603
THEY ALL KIND OF POINT TO THIS 

8255
04:20:19,603 --> 04:20:22,206
IMAGE OF A PARTY BOY WHICH RUNS 

8256
04:20:22,206 --> 04:20:23,474
REALLY COUNTER TO EVERYTHING HE 

8257
04:20:23,474 --> 04:20:23,941
SAID. 

8258
04:20:23,941 --> 04:20:26,110
HE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO COME 

8259
04:20:26,110 --> 04:20:27,011
ACROSS AS SOMEBODY WHO IS 

8260
04:20:27,011 --> 04:20:29,947
SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND CREDIBLE 

8261
04:20:29,947 --> 04:20:31,015
AND HE'S DOING IT. 

8262
04:20:31,015 --> 04:20:33,317
>> SO LESLIE AND INDICATE LIN, 

8263
04:20:33,317 --> 04:20:34,885
I'D -- CAITLIN, I'D LIKE YOU TO 

8264
04:20:34,885 --> 04:20:36,220
WEIGH IN AS WELL. 

8265
04:20:36,220 --> 04:20:38,055
HOW MUCH CAN HE BACKTRACK TO 

8266
04:20:38,055 --> 04:20:38,422
SEEM CREDIBLE? 

8267
04:20:38,422 --> 04:20:40,291
HE SAID HE NEVER BLACKED OUT 

8268
04:20:40,291 --> 04:20:40,658
FROM DRINKING. 

8269
04:20:40,658 --> 04:20:41,858
WE HAVE NOW, YOU KNOW, COLLEGE 

8270
04:20:41,858 --> 04:20:42,893
CLASSMATES WHO HAVE COME OUT 

8271
04:20:42,893 --> 04:20:44,795
AND SAID, WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF 

8272
04:20:44,795 --> 04:20:46,163
HE BLACKED OUT, BUT HE DRANK A 

8273
04:20:46,163 --> 04:20:47,865
LOT, PEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO PAINT 

8274
04:20:47,865 --> 04:20:51,602
A DIFFERENT PORTRAIT OF HIM AT 

8275
04:20:51,602 --> 04:20:52,803
LEAST WHEN HE WAS PARTYING, 

8276
04:20:52,803 --> 04:20:53,504
RIGHT, NOT NECESSARILY THE 

8277
04:20:53,504 --> 04:20:55,473
BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT SHOWED UP 

8278
04:20:55,473 --> 04:20:56,574
TO CLASS AND GOT STRAIGHT A'S, 

8279
04:20:56,574 --> 04:20:57,208
BUT THE BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT 

8280
04:20:57,208 --> 04:20:59,376
PERHAPS WHEN HE WAS OUT WITH 

8281
04:20:59,376 --> 04:21:01,245
HIS FRIENDS WAS A SLIGHTLY 

8282
04:21:01,245 --> 04:21:03,013
DIFFERENT BRETT KAVANAUGH THAN 

8283
04:21:03,013 --> 04:21:03,580
WE'VE HEARD HIM DESCRIBE. 

8284
04:21:03,580 --> 04:21:05,116
SO AT THIS POINT WHAT DO WE 

8285
04:21:05,116 --> 04:21:08,452
NEED HIM TO SAY THAT WILL MAKE 

8286
04:21:08,452 --> 04:21:08,985
US BELIEVE HIM, LESLIE? 

8287
04:21:08,985 --> 04:21:10,421
>> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 

8288
04:21:10,421 --> 04:21:12,223
DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO GO BACK 

8289
04:21:12,223 --> 04:21:14,625
AND CHANGE HISTORY AND CHANGE 

8290
04:21:14,625 --> 04:21:15,158
HIS STORY. 

8291
04:21:15,158 --> 04:21:16,293
SO WHAT THE STORY, THE 

8292
04:21:16,293 --> 04:21:17,127
NARRATIVE THAT COMES OUT IS 

8293
04:21:17,127 --> 04:21:18,996
THAT HE WAS A BAD DRUNK. 

8294
04:21:18,996 --> 04:21:19,263
>> RIGHT. 

8295
04:21:19,263 --> 04:21:21,365
>> THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS 

8296
04:21:21,365 --> 04:21:22,399
CRUDE, HE PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, 

8297
04:21:22,399 --> 04:21:24,034
ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF 

8298
04:21:24,034 --> 04:21:25,169
ACTIVITY, BUT THERE IS SOME 

8299
04:21:25,169 --> 04:21:26,737
ACTIVITY TO POINT TO. 

8300
04:21:26,737 --> 04:21:27,772
AND THEN THERE'S THE OTHER SIDE 

8301
04:21:27,772 --> 04:21:29,907
WHEN HE WAS, YOU KNOW, WORKING 

8302
04:21:29,907 --> 04:21:32,076
AS A COLLEAGUE AND HE HAS OTHER 

8303
04:21:32,076 --> 04:21:32,743
CHARACTER REFERENCES TO GO BACK 

8304
04:21:32,743 --> 04:21:35,546
TO WHEN HE WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 

8305
04:21:35,546 --> 04:21:35,946
AND HIGH SCHOOL. 

8306
04:21:35,946 --> 04:21:36,447
THOSE ARE GREAT. 

8307
04:21:36,447 --> 04:21:38,716
BUT IT'S THIS ISSUE OF ALCOHOL 

8308
04:21:38,716 --> 04:21:39,884
AND WHAT HIS BEHAVIOR WAS LIKE 

8309
04:21:39,884 --> 04:21:41,152
AT THAT TIME WHICH 

8310
04:21:41,152 --> 04:21:42,720
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE'RE 

8311
04:21:42,720 --> 04:21:44,455
GOING TO DIVE DEEPER INTO LATER 

8312
04:21:44,455 --> 04:21:44,855
THIS AFTERNOON. 

8313
04:21:44,855 --> 04:21:45,456
THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION. 

8314
04:21:45,456 --> 04:21:46,991
BECAUSE IF HE HAD SAID I HAD 

8315
04:21:46,991 --> 04:21:48,492
DONE SOME THINGS I'M NOT PROUD 

8316
04:21:48,492 --> 04:21:50,227
OF, ALCOHOL WAS INVOLVED IN 

8317
04:21:50,227 --> 04:21:51,028
THOSE THINGS, BUT I'VE NEVER 

8318
04:21:51,028 --> 04:21:52,897
DONE ANYTHING TO THE EXTENT OF 

8319
04:21:52,897 --> 04:21:53,130
THAT -- 

8320
04:21:53,130 --> 04:21:53,430
>> EXACTLY. 

8321
04:21:53,430 --> 04:21:54,631
>> THERE WOULD BE -- PEOPLE 

8322
04:21:54,631 --> 04:21:57,434
WOULD GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF 

8323
04:21:57,434 --> 04:21:57,734
THE DOUBT. 

8324
04:21:57,734 --> 04:21:58,168
HE'S REPENALTIED. 

8325
04:21:58,168 --> 04:21:59,470
AND THERE ARE MANY -- REPENTED. 

8326
04:21:59,470 --> 04:22:00,805
AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO 

8327
04:22:00,805 --> 04:22:02,873
HAVE DONE THINGS AS YOUNG 

8328
04:22:02,873 --> 04:22:04,608
TEENAGERS OR YOUNG ADULTS AND 

8329
04:22:04,608 --> 04:22:05,108
CHANGED THEIR BEHAVIOR. 

8330
04:22:05,108 --> 04:22:05,375
>> YES. 

8331
04:22:05,375 --> 04:22:06,877
>> AND REALLY BECOME KIND OF 

8332
04:22:06,877 --> 04:22:08,078
LEADERS IN OUR COUNTRY. 

8333
04:22:08,078 --> 04:22:10,948
>> AND I THINK AMERICANS ARE 

8334
04:22:10,948 --> 04:22:12,349
SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO 

8335
04:22:12,349 --> 04:22:14,652
ARE REPENTANT AND CHANGE THEIR 

8336
04:22:14,652 --> 04:22:15,019
CHARACTER. 

8337
04:22:15,019 --> 04:22:15,386
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

8338
04:22:15,386 --> 04:22:16,253
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION WHY 

8339
04:22:16,253 --> 04:22:18,088
KAVANAUGH SET A HIGH BAR FOR 

8340
04:22:18,088 --> 04:22:20,124
HIMSELF TO MEET FROM THE VERY 

8341
04:22:20,124 --> 04:22:20,691
BEGINNING, FIRST OF ALL BY 

8342
04:22:20,691 --> 04:22:22,426
DENYING HE WAS EVEN AT THIS 

8343
04:22:22,426 --> 04:22:23,894
PARTY AND THEN GOING EVEN 

8344
04:22:23,894 --> 04:22:25,429
FURTHER IN THAT FOX NEWS 

8345
04:22:25,429 --> 04:22:28,199
INTERVIEW TO KIND OF PAINT 

8346
04:22:28,199 --> 04:22:29,599
HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WASN'T 

8347
04:22:29,599 --> 04:22:29,966
PARTICIPATING. 

8348
04:22:29,966 --> 04:22:31,268
>> I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP 

8349
04:22:31,268 --> 04:22:31,835
THAT FOX NEWS INTERVIEW. 

8350
04:22:31,835 --> 04:22:34,805
WE HAVE SOME SOUND FOR THAT. 

8351
04:22:34,805 --> 04:22:38,809
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY IT RIGHT 

8352
04:22:38,809 --> 04:22:39,009
NOW. 

8353
04:22:39,009 --> 04:22:40,444
>> WERE THERE TIMES WHEN 

8354
04:22:40,444 --> 04:22:41,412
PERHAPS YOU DRANK SO MUCH -- 

8355
04:22:41,412 --> 04:22:42,980
WAS THERE EVER A TIME THAT YOU 

8356
04:22:42,980 --> 04:22:44,180
DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU COULDN'T 

8357
04:22:44,180 --> 04:22:46,917
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE 

8358
04:22:46,917 --> 04:22:47,250
NIGHT BEFORE? 

8359
04:22:47,250 --> 04:22:47,484
>> NO. 

8360
04:22:47,484 --> 04:22:49,452
THAT NEVER HAPPENED. 

8361
04:22:49,452 --> 04:22:50,888
>> YOU NEVER SAID TO ANYONE, I 

8362
04:22:50,888 --> 04:22:51,589
DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT 

8363
04:22:51,589 --> 04:22:51,956
LAST NIGHT? 3

8364
04:22:51,956 --> 04:22:53,523
>> NO, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. 

8365
04:22:53,523 --> 04:22:55,192
>> NOW OF COURSE HE WAS NOT 

8366
04:22:55,192 --> 04:22:57,094
UNDER OATH THERE, THAT WAS A 

8367
04:22:57,094 --> 04:22:58,062
MEDIA INTERVIEW, SO IT'S 

8368
04:22:58,062 --> 04:23:00,231
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HE WILL 

8369
04:23:00,231 --> 04:23:00,998
FACE ON CAPITOL HILL. 

8370
04:23:00,998 --> 04:23:02,967
BUT DO WE ALL BELIEVE THAT AT 

8371
04:23:02,967 --> 04:23:03,267
THIS POINT? 

8372
04:23:03,267 --> 04:23:05,002
>> WELL, WHAT HE IS ALSO GOING 

8373
04:23:05,002 --> 04:23:06,637
TO SAY IN HIS TESTIMONY TODAY 

8374
04:23:06,637 --> 04:23:07,538
ACCORDING TO THE PREPARED 

8375
04:23:07,538 --> 04:23:08,606
REMARKS THAT WERE RELEASED BY 

8376
04:23:08,606 --> 04:23:09,440
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

8377
04:23:09,440 --> 04:23:10,441
YESTERDAY, HE'S GOING TO SAY 

8378
04:23:10,441 --> 04:23:13,944
THAT, YEAH, I DRANK SOME BEERS 

8379
04:23:13,944 --> 04:23:14,912
O THE WEEKENDS, I'M 

8380
04:23:14,912 --> 04:23:15,712
PARAPHRASING HERE, BUT, YOU 

8381
04:23:15,712 --> 04:23:16,914
KNOW, AND I'VE DONE SOME -- 

8382
04:23:16,914 --> 04:23:18,482
THERE HAVE BEEN THINGS THAT I 

8383
04:23:18,482 --> 04:23:19,817
HAVE DONE THAT I CRINGE ABOUT, 

8384
04:23:19,817 --> 04:23:22,686
BUT I DID NOT DO THIS, AND HE 

8385
04:23:22,686 --> 04:23:28,492
ALSO GOES ON TO SAY IN THAT 

8386
04:23:28,492 --> 04:23:30,394
PREPARED TESTIMONY THAT WHILE 

8387
04:23:30,394 --> 04:23:32,196
FORD MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED THE 

8388
04:23:32,196 --> 04:23:33,831
TRAUMATIC EVENT OF A SEXUAL 

8389
04:23:33,831 --> 04:23:35,232
ASSAULT, IT WASN'T BY HIM. 

8390
04:23:35,232 --> 04:23:35,532
>> RIGHT. 

8391
04:23:35,532 --> 04:23:36,901
>> SO HE'S KIND OF TRYING TO 

8392
04:23:36,901 --> 04:23:39,136
THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE BY 

8393
04:23:39,136 --> 04:23:40,304
SAYING I'M NOT BEING 

8394
04:23:40,304 --> 04:23:41,472
UNSYMPATHETIC TO HER AND WHAT 

8395
04:23:41,472 --> 04:23:42,706
SHE WENT THROUGH, I'M JUST 

8396
04:23:42,706 --> 04:23:43,440
SAYING THAT WASN'T ME. 

8397
04:23:43,440 --> 04:23:43,673
>> YES. 

8398
04:23:43,673 --> 04:23:45,075
BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST A FEW 

8399
04:23:45,075 --> 04:23:47,244
SENATORS WHO HAVE SAID WHETHER 

8400
04:23:47,244 --> 04:23:47,844
OR NOT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

8401
04:23:47,844 --> 04:23:49,713
COMMITTED THIS SEXUAL ASSAULT I 

8402
04:23:49,713 --> 04:23:50,948
DON'T KNOW, BUT WHETHER HE'S 

8403
04:23:50,948 --> 04:23:51,782
BEING TOTALLY TRUTHFUL WITH US 

8404
04:23:51,782 --> 04:23:53,784
IS REALLY WHAT I AM WORRIED 

8405
04:23:53,784 --> 04:23:54,017
ABOUT. 

8406
04:23:54,017 --> 04:23:56,787
>> AND THAT IS A SITUATION HE 

8407
04:23:56,787 --> 04:23:57,955
CREATED FOR HIMSELF BY SETTING 

8408
04:23:57,955 --> 04:23:59,790
WHAT CAITLIN IS TALKING ABOUT 

8409
04:23:59,790 --> 04:24:02,893
THE BAR SO HIGH THAT IT'S JUST 

8410
04:24:02,893 --> 04:24:04,395
NOT BELIEVABLE, ESPECIALLY -- 

8411
04:24:04,395 --> 04:24:06,797
THAT'S BEFORE WE KNEW HOW 

8412
04:24:06,797 --> 04:24:08,732
CREDIBLE DR. FORD WAS GOING TO 

8413
04:24:08,732 --> 04:24:11,034
BE AND HOW SYMPATHETIC A 

8414
04:24:11,034 --> 04:24:11,534
CHARACTER BECAUSE SHE'S 

8415
04:24:11,534 --> 04:24:12,503
CERTAINLY SOMEBODY YOU CAN SEE 

8416
04:24:12,503 --> 04:24:14,471
DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL 

8417
04:24:14,471 --> 04:24:16,173
MOTIVE TO DO IT, AND HE HAS 

8418
04:24:16,173 --> 04:24:17,675
EVERY POLITICAL MOTIVE TO REACT 

8419
04:24:17,675 --> 04:24:18,142
THE WAY HE DOES. 

8420
04:24:18,142 --> 04:24:20,210
>> SO HOW CAN HE FIX THIS DO 

8421
04:24:20,210 --> 04:24:21,478
YOU THINK IN HIS TESTIMONY? 

8422
04:24:21,478 --> 04:24:22,580
HE'S SORT OF BOXED HIMSELF IN 

8423
04:24:22,580 --> 04:24:24,581
IN A CERTAIN MANNER AT THIS 

8424
04:24:24,581 --> 04:24:24,982
POINT. 

8425
04:24:24,982 --> 04:24:25,949
WHAT DO WE NEED TO SEE? 

8426
04:24:25,949 --> 04:24:28,552
WHAT DOES HE NEED TO SAY THAT 

8427
04:24:28,552 --> 04:24:29,153
WILL CLEAR THIS UP? 

8428
04:24:29,153 --> 04:24:31,255
>> WELL, THE PEOPLE THAT HE 

8429
04:24:31,255 --> 04:24:32,923
NEEDS TO CONVINCE AREN'T 

8430
04:24:32,923 --> 04:24:35,091
NECESSARILY ON THE JUDICIARY 

8431
04:24:35,091 --> 04:24:35,392
COMMITTEE. 

8432
04:24:35,392 --> 04:24:38,862
THEY ARE MEMBERS LIKE SUSAN 

8433
04:24:38,862 --> 04:24:39,395
COLLINS OF MAINE, LISA 

8434
04:24:39,395 --> 04:24:41,198
MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA, JEFF FLAKE 

8435
04:24:41,198 --> 04:24:44,902
OF COURSE IS ON THAT COMMITTEE, 

8436
04:24:44,902 --> 04:24:46,937
AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, HE 

8437
04:24:46,937 --> 04:24:48,772
DID CEDE HIS QUESTION TO THE 

8438
04:24:48,772 --> 04:24:49,740
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN THAT 

8439
04:24:49,740 --> 04:24:50,007
INSTANCE. 

8440
04:24:50,007 --> 04:24:51,975
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 

8441
04:24:51,975 --> 04:24:53,510
SWING VOTES HERE IN TERMS OF 

8442
04:24:53,510 --> 04:24:55,145
WHAT HE COULD GET IN THE 

8443
04:24:55,145 --> 04:24:55,378
SENATE. 

8444
04:24:55,378 --> 04:24:57,648
AND WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER 

8445
04:24:57,648 --> 04:24:59,216
TOO THAT WHILE THE PUBLIC IS 

8446
04:24:59,216 --> 04:25:00,684
WATCHING, ONE KEY FIGURE OF 

8447
04:25:00,684 --> 04:25:01,284
THAT PUBLIC IS WATCHING WHICH 

8448
04:25:01,284 --> 04:25:03,354
IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

8449
04:25:03,354 --> 04:25:05,089
STATES WHO HAS THE POWER TO, 

8450
04:25:05,089 --> 04:25:06,957
YOU KNOW, DEMAND THAT KAVANAUGH 

8451
04:25:06,957 --> 04:25:09,894
GET A VOTE OR TO WITHDRAW HIM 

8452
04:25:09,894 --> 04:25:11,095
DEPENDING ON HOW HE FEELS THIS 

8453
04:25:11,095 --> 04:25:13,163
TESTIMONY HAS BEEN GOING, HOW 

8454
04:25:13,163 --> 04:25:15,466
HE FEELS ABOUT FORD, HOW HE 

8455
04:25:15,466 --> 04:25:16,767
FEELS ABOUT KAVANAUGH IN 

8456
04:25:16,767 --> 04:25:18,535
RESPONDING TO FORD. 

8457
04:25:18,535 --> 04:25:20,037
IT STILL REMAINS A BIG QUESTION 

8458
04:25:20,037 --> 04:25:20,604
MARK. 

8459
04:25:20,604 --> 04:25:22,239
OF COURSE HOVERING OVER THAT 

8460
04:25:22,239 --> 04:25:23,440
DECISION TOO IS HE HAS ALSO 

8461
04:25:23,440 --> 04:25:24,675
BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

8462
04:25:24,675 --> 04:25:25,843
AND HE ELABORATED ON THAT 

8463
04:25:25,843 --> 04:25:29,146
YESTERDAY IN THE PRESS 

8464
04:25:29,146 --> 04:25:30,247
CONFERENCE SAYING THAT IS 

8465
04:25:30,247 --> 04:25:31,849
INFORMING HIS -- IS FORMING HIS 

8466
04:25:31,849 --> 04:25:32,750
OPINION IN TERMS OF KAVANAUGH. 

8467
04:25:32,750 --> 04:25:33,817
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT. 

8468
04:25:33,817 --> 04:25:38,255
WE DO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT 

8469
04:25:38,255 --> 04:25:38,822
QUESTION, YOU KNOW, OF 

8470
04:25:38,822 --> 04:25:42,760
CERTAINTY, AND DR. FORD SAID 

8471
04:25:42,760 --> 04:25:44,194
SHE IS 100% CERTAIN, NOT 99.9%, 

8472
04:25:44,194 --> 04:25:45,496
BUT 100% CERTAIN THAT BRETT 

8473
04:25:45,496 --> 04:25:47,831
KAVANAUGH IS THE MAN WHO 

8474
04:25:47,831 --> 04:25:49,566
ASSAULTED HER OR THE BOY, 

8475
04:25:49,566 --> 04:25:49,799
RATHER. 

8476
04:25:49,799 --> 04:25:51,769
DO WE NEED TO HEAR BRETT 

8477
04:25:51,769 --> 04:25:53,570
KAVANAUGH SAY HE IS 100% 

8478
04:25:53,570 --> 04:25:54,804
CERTAIN HE DID NOT DO IT? 

8479
04:25:54,804 --> 04:25:58,142
>> LET'S JUST SAY HE DOES THAT. 

8480
04:25:58,142 --> 04:26:00,511
LET'S SAY HE DOES THAT. 

8481
04:26:00,511 --> 04:26:01,712
SHE STILL IS COMING ACROSS AS 

8482
04:26:01,712 --> 04:26:04,181
SUCH -- IN SUCH A COMPELLING 

8483
04:26:04,181 --> 04:26:05,349
WAY BECAUSE SHE'S EXPLAINING 

8484
04:26:05,349 --> 04:26:06,784
HER TRAUMA. 

8485
04:26:06,784 --> 04:26:08,652
SHE'S EXPLAINING THE LAUGHTER, 

8486
04:26:08,652 --> 04:26:09,586
SHE'S EXPLAINING THESE VERY 

8487
04:26:09,586 --> 04:26:11,654
SPECIFIC DETAILS THAT AS SHE 

8488
04:26:11,654 --> 04:26:13,590
SAID SEARED HER MEMORY, AND I 

8489
04:26:13,590 --> 04:26:14,691
DON'T THINK -- THE INTERESTING 

8490
04:26:14,691 --> 04:26:15,759
PART, AND LYNDA TALKS ABOUT IT 

8491
04:26:15,759 --> 04:26:18,328
A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF HOW 

8492
04:26:18,328 --> 04:26:20,864
WE'RE LOSING REPUBLICAN WOMEN 

8493
04:26:20,864 --> 04:26:21,364
AND INDEPENDENT WOMEN. 

8494
04:26:21,364 --> 04:26:22,966
WE GOT A LOT OF WOMEN WHO 

8495
04:26:22,966 --> 04:26:23,934
EXPERIENCED SOMETHING VERY 

8496
04:26:23,934 --> 04:26:26,070
SIMILAR TO THAT AND IT ECHOS 

8497
04:26:26,070 --> 04:26:27,438
THAT ONE OR TWO MEMORY POINTS. 

8498
04:26:27,438 --> 04:26:29,573
SO SHE IS SPEAKING AT A 

8499
04:26:29,573 --> 04:26:30,574
DIFFERENT FREQUENCY THAT IS 

8500
04:26:30,574 --> 04:26:35,012
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR 

8501
04:26:35,012 --> 04:26:35,846
HIM TO COUNTER. 

8502
04:26:35,846 --> 04:26:37,448
>> LET'S TOSS FOR A MOMENT 

8503
04:26:37,448 --> 04:26:38,415
DURING THE TESTIMONY WHEN DR. 

8504
04:26:38,415 --> 04:26:42,086
FORD TALKED ABOUT HER STRONGEST 

8505
04:26:42,086 --> 04:26:43,153
MEMORY OF THE ASSAULT. 

8506
04:26:43,153 --> 04:26:44,454
LET'S LISTEN. 

8507
04:26:44,454 --> 04:26:47,290
>> WHAT IS THE STRONGEST MEMORY 

8508
04:26:47,290 --> 04:26:48,992
YOU HAVE, STRONGEST MEMORY OF 

8509
04:26:48,992 --> 04:26:50,928
THE INCIDENT, SOMETHING THAT 

8510
04:26:50,928 --> 04:26:56,766
YOU CANNOT FORGET? 

8511
04:26:56,766 --> 04:26:59,036
TAKE WHATEVER TIME YOU NEED. 

8512
04:26:59,036 --> 04:27:03,240
>> INDELLIBLE IN THE HIPPA 

8513
04:27:03,240 --> 04:27:08,512
CAMPUS IS THE LAUGHTER, THE 

8514
04:27:08,512 --> 04:27:12,082
UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER BETWEEN THE 

8515
04:27:12,082 --> 04:27:16,153
TWO AND THEIR HAVING FUN AT MY 

8516
04:27:16,153 --> 04:27:16,419
EXPENSE. 

8517
04:27:16,419 --> 04:27:18,655
>> YOU'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT 

8518
04:27:18,655 --> 04:27:20,257
LAUGHTER, YOU'VE NEVER 

8519
04:27:20,257 --> 04:27:22,226
FORGOTTEN THEM LAUGHING AT YOU? 

8520
04:27:22,226 --> 04:27:23,327
>> THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH EACH 

8521
04:27:23,327 --> 04:27:23,560
OTHER. 

8522
04:27:23,560 --> 04:27:28,499
>> AND YOU WERE THE OBJECT OF 

8523
04:27:28,499 --> 04:27:28,866
THE LAUGHTER? 

8524
04:27:28,866 --> 04:27:32,703
>> I WAS UNDERNEATH ONE OF THEM 

8525
04:27:32,703 --> 04:27:34,505
WHILE THE TWO LAUGHED, TWO 

8526
04:27:34,505 --> 04:27:39,175
FRIENDS HAVING A REALLY GOOD 

8527
04:27:39,175 --> 04:27:39,943
TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER. 

8528
04:27:39,943 --> 04:27:42,613
>> I MEAN, THOSE WORDS ARE LIKE 

8529
04:27:42,613 --> 04:27:43,914
A GUT PUNCH, AND SHE'S 

8530
04:27:43,914 --> 04:27:46,216
DELIVERING THEM WITH -- THERE'S 

8531
04:27:46,216 --> 04:27:46,749
SO MUCH PAIN PRESENT. 

8532
04:27:46,749 --> 04:27:51,521
YOU KNOW, TO ME IT GOES TO THE 

8533
04:27:51,521 --> 04:27:54,257
QUESTION OF CHARACTER, RIGHT? 

8534
04:27:54,257 --> 04:27:56,193
HOW CAN ANYONE DERIVE PLEASURE 

8535
04:27:56,193 --> 04:27:57,661
AT TERRIFYING A YOUNG, INNOCENT 

8536
04:27:57,661 --> 04:27:57,994
GIRL, RIGHT? 

8537
04:27:57,994 --> 04:27:59,630
EVEN IF YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN 

8538
04:27:59,630 --> 04:28:03,133
WHO'S MAYBE HAD A FEW TOO MANY 

8539
04:28:03,133 --> 04:28:04,868
BEERS, YOU WOULD STILL THINK 

8540
04:28:04,868 --> 04:28:06,436
THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT YOUR 

8541
04:28:06,436 --> 04:28:06,970
CHARACTER WOULD KICK IN. 

8542
04:28:06,970 --> 04:28:09,106
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE THE 

8543
04:28:09,106 --> 04:28:09,807
INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE 

8544
04:28:09,807 --> 04:28:13,477
IT'S LIKE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME 

8545
04:28:13,477 --> 04:28:14,010
MAN, RIGHT? 

8546
04:28:14,010 --> 04:28:16,313
WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE LONG 

8547
04:28:16,313 --> 04:28:18,048
HISTORY OF A VERY STRONG SOLID 

8548
04:28:18,048 --> 04:28:21,151
JURIST, AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS 

8549
04:28:21,151 --> 04:28:22,052
OTHER SIDE, THIS KIND OF DARKER 

8550
04:28:22,052 --> 04:28:23,153
SIDE WHEN ALCOHOL SEEMS TO BE 

8551
04:28:23,153 --> 04:28:25,155
INVOLVED IN THE YOUTH BEING 

8552
04:28:25,155 --> 04:28:25,422
INVOLVED. 

8553
04:28:25,422 --> 04:28:26,156
MAYBE HE SHOOK ALL OF THAT, 

8554
04:28:26,156 --> 04:28:27,957
MAYBE HE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT. 

8555
04:28:27,957 --> 04:28:29,726
BUT HE DOESN'T EVER ADMIT IT. 

8556
04:28:29,726 --> 04:28:32,496
HE DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT IN A 

8557
04:28:32,496 --> 04:28:33,497
WAY THAT SEEMS PALATABLE THAT 

8558
04:28:33,497 --> 04:28:33,930
PEOPLE CAN ACCEPT. 

8559
04:28:33,930 --> 04:28:35,599
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE 

8560
04:28:35,599 --> 04:28:35,932
HARDEST PART. 

8561
04:28:35,932 --> 04:28:37,634
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S 

8562
04:28:37,634 --> 04:28:42,172
GOING TO HAVE THAT KIND OF 

8563
04:28:42,172 --> 04:28:43,507
COMING TO TRUTHFULNESS WITH THE 

8564
04:28:43,507 --> 04:28:44,474
COMMITTEE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 

8565
04:28:44,474 --> 04:28:46,310
IT WOULD REQUIRE HIM TO GO BACK 

8566
04:28:46,310 --> 04:28:48,745
AGAINST SOME OF HIS PREVIOUS 

8567
04:28:48,745 --> 04:28:49,045
STATEMENTS. 

8568
04:28:49,045 --> 04:28:49,312
>> RIGHT. 

8569
04:28:49,312 --> 04:28:50,280
BUT THAT'S THE TYPE OF HUMILITY 

8570
04:28:50,280 --> 04:28:52,683
WE WOULD ALMOST LIKE TO SEE 

8571
04:28:52,683 --> 04:28:53,983
FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS COMMITTED 

8572
04:28:53,983 --> 04:28:54,651
SOMETHING EGREGIOUS IN THEIR 

8573
04:28:54,651 --> 04:28:54,851
PAST. 

8574
04:28:54,851 --> 04:28:56,053
I READ A VERY INTERESTING 

8575
04:28:56,053 --> 04:28:57,054
ACCOUNT OF A WOMAN WHO DID HAVE 

8576
04:28:57,054 --> 04:28:59,756
A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE IN HIGH 

8577
04:28:59,756 --> 04:29:01,291
SCHOOL AND LATER HER ASSAILANT 

8578
04:29:01,291 --> 04:29:02,126
FOUND HER AND TEARFULLY 

8579
04:29:02,126 --> 04:29:04,828
APOLOGIZED, AND SHE SAID YOU 

8580
04:29:04,828 --> 04:29:05,929
KNOW WHAT? 

8581
04:29:05,929 --> 04:29:06,296
I FORGAVE HIM. 

8582
04:29:06,296 --> 04:29:06,763
BUT HE APOLOGIZED. 

8583
04:29:06,763 --> 04:29:08,465
AND I THINK WITH WHAT IS SO 

8584
04:29:08,465 --> 04:29:09,900
SEARING FOR SO MANY WOMEN WHO 

8585
04:29:09,900 --> 04:29:12,803
HAVE GONE THROUGH SOMETHING 

8586
04:29:12,803 --> 04:29:14,204
LIKE THIS IS THE SEEMING LACK 

8587
04:29:14,204 --> 04:29:16,073
OF SELF-QUESTIONING AS TO WHY 

8588
04:29:16,073 --> 04:29:17,174
WOULD THESE WOMEN EVEN EVER 

8589
04:29:17,174 --> 04:29:18,909
ACCUSE ME OF THIS, YOU KNOW, 

8590
04:29:18,909 --> 04:29:19,442
THERE'S NO QUESTIONING. 

8591
04:29:19,442 --> 04:29:20,744
YES, MAYBE HE SAYS I DID NOT DO 

8592
04:29:20,744 --> 04:29:22,613
THIS, BUT WOULD HE STOP AND SAY 

8593
04:29:22,613 --> 04:29:24,781
WHY ARE THEY ACCUSING ME OF 

8594
04:29:24,781 --> 04:29:24,981
THIS? 

8595
04:29:24,981 --> 04:29:26,917
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A 

8596
04:29:26,917 --> 04:29:29,886
MOMENT AND HAVE SOME SORT OF 

8597
04:29:29,886 --> 04:29:31,788
SELF-RECKONING OF SOME TYPE OF 

8598
04:29:31,788 --> 04:29:34,424
BEHAVIOR IN HIS PAST THAT MIGHT 

8599
04:29:34,424 --> 04:29:36,693
HAVE LENT THIS -- SOMETHING 

8600
04:29:36,693 --> 04:29:37,160
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. 

8601
04:29:37,160 --> 04:29:38,295
>> WELL, HE -- I THINK YOU 

8602
04:29:38,295 --> 04:29:40,163
BRING UP A REALLY GOOD POINT IN 

8603
04:29:40,163 --> 04:29:41,832
TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HE 

8604
04:29:41,832 --> 04:29:42,899
WILL HAVE IN ADDRESSING THAT 

8605
04:29:42,899 --> 04:29:45,135
KIND OF QUESTION IF IT COMES UP 

8606
04:29:45,135 --> 04:29:46,904
BECAUSE HE SAYS FROM THE VERY 

8607
04:29:46,904 --> 04:29:47,971
BEGINNING THAT HE HAD NO 

8608
04:29:47,971 --> 04:29:48,972
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS, THAT HE 

8609
04:29:48,972 --> 04:29:51,008
WASN'T THERE AND THAT IT WASN'T 

8610
04:29:51,008 --> 04:29:51,208
HIM. 

8611
04:29:51,208 --> 04:29:51,475
>> RIGHT. 

8612
04:29:51,475 --> 04:29:55,345
>> SO, AGAIN, GOING TO THAT BAR 

8613
04:29:55,345 --> 04:29:58,415
THAT HE -- SO GOING TO THAT BAR 

8614
04:29:58,415 --> 04:30:00,116
THAT'S SET, IT'S DIFFICULT FOR 

8615
04:30:00,116 --> 04:30:01,585
HIM TO DEVIATE IN ANY WAY BY 

8616
04:30:01,585 --> 04:30:01,785
THAT. 

8617
04:30:01,785 --> 04:30:05,455
AND HE'S GOING TO DO IT BY 

8618
04:30:05,455 --> 04:30:08,125
PROXY, RIGHT? 

8619
04:30:08,125 --> 04:30:09,726
SAY I DIDN'T DO THIS BUT -- I 

8620
04:30:09,726 --> 04:30:10,927
THINK TALKING ABOUT THE 

8621
04:30:10,927 --> 04:30:12,529
LAUGHTER ELEMENT AND WHAT SHE 

8622
04:30:12,529 --> 04:30:13,930
WENT THROUGH, REMEMBER, SHE WAS 

8623
04:30:13,930 --> 04:30:15,399
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL. 

8624
04:30:15,399 --> 04:30:17,634
THAT IS A VERY FORMITIVE AGE, A 

8625
04:30:17,634 --> 04:30:20,537
COMING OF AGE AND A VERY 

8626
04:30:20,537 --> 04:30:22,005
SENSITIVE TIME, ESPECIALLY FOR 

8627
04:30:22,005 --> 04:30:22,572
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL. 

8628
04:30:22,572 --> 04:30:24,207
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 

8629
04:30:24,207 --> 04:30:26,109
THAT THIS WAS 35 YEARS AGO. 

8630
04:30:26,109 --> 04:30:28,612
WE ALSO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT 

8631
04:30:28,612 --> 04:30:31,548
SHE SAYS HAVE BEEN LASTING 

8632
04:30:31,548 --> 04:30:32,482
EFFECTS FROM THAT. 

8633
04:30:32,482 --> 04:30:35,385
SHE'S TALKED ABOUT PTSD, SHE'S 

8634
04:30:35,385 --> 04:30:36,252
TALKED ABOUT CURRENT ANXIETY, 

8635
04:30:36,252 --> 04:30:38,555
PANIC ATTACKS, CLAUSE INTRODUCE 

8636
04:30:38,555 --> 04:30:42,426
PHOBIA, THINGS THAT HAVE -- 

8637
04:30:42,426 --> 04:30:43,226
CLOS INTRODUCE PHOBIA, THINGS 

8638
04:30:43,226 --> 04:30:43,426
THAT. 

8639
04:30:43,426 --> 04:30:45,062
IT'S NOT THINGS THAT HAPPENED 

8640
04:30:45,062 --> 04:30:46,596
35 YEARS AGO, IT'S REMARKABLE 

8641
04:30:46,596 --> 04:30:49,166
THAT IN OVER 35 YEARS SHE IS 

8642
04:30:49,166 --> 04:30:50,266
STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS. 

8643
04:30:50,266 --> 04:30:51,401
>> WELL, THE MANIFEST 

8644
04:30:51,401 --> 04:30:51,968
ALLEGATIONS, RIGHT, WHETHER 

8645
04:30:51,968 --> 04:30:54,471
THEY'RE PANIC ATTACKS ON AN 

8646
04:30:54,471 --> 04:30:55,004
AIRPLANE AND PEOPLE ARE 

8647
04:30:55,004 --> 04:30:55,739
CRITICIZING ON TWITTER, WELL, 

8648
04:30:55,739 --> 04:30:57,674
SHE GOT ON A PLANE TO GO ON 

8649
04:30:57,674 --> 04:30:57,941
VACATION. 

8650
04:30:57,941 --> 04:30:59,443
IT DOES NOT MEAN SHE CANNOT GET 

8651
04:30:59,443 --> 04:31:00,176
ON A PLANE. 

8652
04:31:00,176 --> 04:31:01,278
IT MEANS THAT ANXIETY CONTINUE, 

8653
04:31:01,278 --> 04:31:02,612
IT'S THE ANXIETY TO PUT IN A 

8654
04:31:02,612 --> 04:31:05,115
SECOND FRONT DOOR, IT'S THE 

8655
04:31:05,115 --> 04:31:06,683
ANXIETY TO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN 

8656
04:31:06,683 --> 04:31:07,050
RELATIONSHIPS. 

8657
04:31:07,050 --> 04:31:08,819
AND SO I THINK COLLECTIVELY WE 

8658
04:31:08,819 --> 04:31:10,854
WILL AGREE SOMETHING DID 

8659
04:31:10,854 --> 04:31:11,087
HAPPEN. 

8660
04:31:11,087 --> 04:31:12,456
BUT HOW CLEAR SHE IS ABOUT WHO 

8661
04:31:12,456 --> 04:31:15,158
ASSAULTED HER IS GOING TO BE 

8662
04:31:15,158 --> 04:31:16,093
THE BIGGER CHALLENGE, RIGHT? 

8663
04:31:16,093 --> 04:31:18,495
AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO 

8664
04:31:18,495 --> 04:31:18,962
RECONCILE THOSE TWO? 

8665
04:31:18,962 --> 04:31:21,465
AND EVEN IF THE JUDGE DOES COME 

8666
04:31:21,465 --> 04:31:22,933
ACROSS AS VERY SYMPATHETIC, 

8667
04:31:22,933 --> 04:31:24,368
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO REALLY 

8668
04:31:24,368 --> 04:31:25,969
WONDER ABOUT THIS, AND I THINK 

8669
04:31:25,969 --> 04:31:26,636
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. 

8670
04:31:26,636 --> 04:31:28,505
AND I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO GO 

8671
04:31:28,505 --> 04:31:29,539
THROUGH SOME REALLY UGLY 

8672
04:31:29,539 --> 04:31:31,775
DETAILS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS 

8673
04:31:31,775 --> 04:31:33,610
THAT NOBODY -- NOBODY WANTS TO 

8674
04:31:33,610 --> 04:31:34,210
GO THROUGH. 

8675
04:31:34,210 --> 04:31:34,544
>> I AGREE. 

8676
04:31:34,544 --> 04:31:36,113
LET'S LISTEN TO DR. FORD TALK 

8677
04:31:36,113 --> 04:31:39,716
ABOUT HOW THIS EVENT HAS 

8678
04:31:39,716 --> 04:31:41,017
AFFECTED HER LIFE. 

8679
04:31:41,017 --> 04:31:42,419
>> BRETT'S ASSAULT ON ME 

8680
04:31:42,419 --> 04:31:44,354
DRASTICALLY ALTERED MY LIFE FOR 

8681
04:31:44,354 --> 04:31:46,223
A VERY LONG TIME. 

8682
04:31:46,223 --> 04:31:49,726
I WAS TOO AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO 

8683
04:31:49,726 --> 04:31:50,293
TELL ANYONE THESE DETAILS. 

8684
04:31:50,293 --> 04:31:53,096
I DID NOT WANT TO TELL MY 

8685
04:31:53,096 --> 04:31:56,867
PARENTS THAT I AT AGE 15 WAS IN 

8686
04:31:56,867 --> 04:32:02,773
A HOUSE WITHOUT ANY PARENTS 

8687
04:32:02,773 --> 04:32:03,807
PRESENT DRINKING BEER WITH 

8688
04:32:03,807 --> 04:32:04,107
BOYS. 

8689
04:32:04,107 --> 04:32:05,074
I CONVINCED MYSELF THAT BECAUSE 

8690
04:32:05,074 --> 04:32:07,010
BRETT DID NOT RAPE ME, I SHOULD 

8691
04:32:07,010 --> 04:32:10,480
JUST MOVE ON AND JUST PRETEND 

8692
04:32:10,480 --> 04:32:11,281
THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

8693
04:32:11,281 --> 04:32:12,849
OVER THE YEARS I TOLD VERY, 

8694
04:32:12,849 --> 04:32:17,587
VERY FEW FRIENDS THAT I HAD 

8695
04:32:17,587 --> 04:32:18,187
THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE 

8696
04:32:18,187 --> 04:32:19,690
>> LYNDA, I WANT TO BRING YOU 

8697
04:32:19,690 --> 04:32:20,991
IN NOW BECAUSE WE JUST HEARD 

8698
04:32:20,991 --> 04:32:22,092
DR. FORD TALK ABOUT THIS 

8699
04:32:22,092 --> 04:32:22,859
EXPERIENCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN 

8700
04:32:22,859 --> 04:32:24,861
SHE WAS 15 WENT ON TO AFFECT 

8701
04:32:24,861 --> 04:32:27,364
THE REST OF HER LIFE. 

8702
04:32:27,364 --> 04:32:29,199
DR. FORD AND OTHERS WHO COME 

8703
04:32:29,199 --> 04:32:29,966
FORWARD WITH STORIES OR 

8704
04:32:29,966 --> 04:32:32,202
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

8705
04:32:32,202 --> 04:32:32,836
THAT HAPPENED LONG AGO OFTEN 

8706
04:32:32,836 --> 04:32:33,770
FACE CRITICISM, SOME PEOPLE 

8707
04:32:33,770 --> 04:32:35,005
SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT 

8708
04:32:35,005 --> 04:32:37,908
HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO, WHY 

8709
04:32:37,908 --> 04:32:38,841
RUIN A MAN'S LIFE NOW? 

8710
04:32:38,841 --> 04:32:40,377
AND I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR HOW 

8711
04:32:40,377 --> 04:32:42,546
HER LIFE HAS ALREADY -- I MEAN, 

8712
04:32:42,546 --> 04:32:44,314
NOT BEEN RUINED, SHE'S 

8713
04:32:44,314 --> 04:32:44,881
OBVIOUSLY A VERY SUCCESSFUL 

8714
04:32:44,881 --> 04:32:45,816
WOMAN, BUT SHE'S CARRIED SO 

8715
04:32:45,816 --> 04:32:47,818
MUCH OF THE PAIN FROM THAT 

8716
04:32:47,818 --> 04:32:51,321
ATTACK THROUGH THE REST OF HER 

8717
04:32:51,321 --> 04:32:51,922
LIFE, IT COLORS THOSE 

8718
04:32:51,922 --> 04:32:52,889
ACCUSATIONS THAT COME FROM 

8719
04:32:52,889 --> 04:32:55,258
PEOPLE SAYING, WELL, WHY ARE 

8720
04:32:55,258 --> 04:32:56,560
YOU TRYING TO RUIN SOMEONE'S 

8721
04:32:56,560 --> 04:32:58,695
LIFE AT THIS POINT, WOULD YOU 

8722
04:32:58,695 --> 04:32:59,028
AGREE, LYNDA? 

8723
04:32:59,028 --> 04:32:59,295
>> YEAH. 

8724
04:32:59,295 --> 04:33:00,530
I THINK THAT DR. BLASEY FORD 

8725
04:33:00,530 --> 04:33:02,966
GETS AT THE CORE OF WHAT SO 

8726
04:33:02,966 --> 04:33:04,534
MANY VICTIMS OF ASSAULT DEAL 

8727
04:33:04,534 --> 04:33:07,135
WITH WHICH IS SHE SAID SHE WAS 

8728
04:33:07,135 --> 04:33:07,704
AFRAID AND ASHAMED. 

8729
04:33:07,704 --> 04:33:08,872
BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 

8730
04:33:08,872 --> 04:33:10,540
THIS HAPPENS TO YOU, YOU FEEL 

8731
04:33:10,540 --> 04:33:12,876
SOME SENSE OF GUILT, YOU WONDER 

8732
04:33:12,876 --> 04:33:14,978
WHAT ROLE YOU MAY HAVE PLAYED 

8733
04:33:14,978 --> 04:33:16,346
IN BRINGING IT ABOUT AND FEEL 

8734
04:33:16,346 --> 04:33:17,481
LIKE YOU'RE NOT SOMEHOW 

8735
04:33:17,481 --> 04:33:20,016
INNOCENT OF IT, NO MATTER WHAT 

8736
04:33:20,016 --> 04:33:20,516
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. 

8737
04:33:20,516 --> 04:33:22,618
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF 

8738
04:33:22,618 --> 04:33:23,319
WHAT SHE WAS DESCRIBING. 

8739
04:33:23,319 --> 04:33:25,055
I ALSO THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR 

8740
04:33:25,055 --> 04:33:26,122
IN HER DETAILING OF THE 

8741
04:33:26,122 --> 04:33:28,391
CHRONOLOGY OF HOW SHE BROUGHT 

8742
04:33:28,391 --> 04:33:29,826
HER STORY FORWARD THAT SHE WAS 

8743
04:33:29,826 --> 04:33:31,395
GRAPPLING WITH WHETHER OR NOT 

8744
04:33:31,395 --> 04:33:34,364
IT MADE SENSE AT THIS JUNCTURE 

8745
04:33:34,364 --> 04:33:36,500
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS TO SHARE 

8746
04:33:36,500 --> 04:33:38,068
THIS STORY WITH ANYONE, MUCH 

8747
04:33:38,068 --> 04:33:39,503
LESS WITH THE WORLD. 

8748
04:33:39,503 --> 04:33:41,136
SO I THINK THAT SHE IS STILL 

8749
04:33:41,136 --> 04:33:43,439
CLEARLY DEALING WITH THE IMPACT 

8750
04:33:43,439 --> 04:33:44,841
OF THAT REGARDLESS OF HOW 

8751
04:33:44,841 --> 04:33:45,675
SUCCESSFUL SHE'S BEEN IN HER 

8752
04:33:45,675 --> 04:33:46,975
LIFE AND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING 

8753
04:33:46,975 --> 04:33:49,379
THAT A LOT OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO 

8754
04:33:49,379 --> 04:33:52,080
HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED CAN REALLY 

8755
04:33:52,080 --> 04:33:52,381
RELATE TO. 

8756
04:33:52,381 --> 04:33:53,417
ALSO TO THE EARLIER POINT ABOUT 

8757
04:33:53,417 --> 04:33:55,351
WHAT, YOU KNOW, BRETT KAVANAUGH 

8758
04:33:55,351 --> 04:33:57,653
CAN SAY OR DO AT THIS POINT, 

8759
04:33:57,653 --> 04:33:58,287
WHEN YOU JUXTAPOSE ANYTHING 

8760
04:33:58,287 --> 04:34:01,258
THAT HE MIGHT SAY IN THE NEXT 

8761
04:34:01,258 --> 04:34:03,993
COUPLE OF HOURS WITH DR. BLASEY 

8762
04:34:03,993 --> 04:34:05,027
FORD TALKING ABOUT THE 

8763
04:34:05,027 --> 04:34:05,929
INDELLIBLE MEMORY OF HIS 

8764
04:34:05,929 --> 04:34:07,731
LAUGHTER, I THINK THERE'S VERY 

8765
04:34:07,731 --> 04:34:10,332
LITTLE THAT HE CAN DO THAT IS 

8766
04:34:10,332 --> 04:34:13,470
GOING TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION IN 

8767
04:34:13,470 --> 04:34:15,572
A WAY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. 

8768
04:34:15,572 --> 04:34:16,339
BUT THE REAL QUESTION COMES 

8769
04:34:16,339 --> 04:34:19,142
DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT HE CAN 

8770
04:34:19,142 --> 04:34:20,676
REACH THE HANDFUL OF 

8771
04:34:20,676 --> 04:34:21,310
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROBABLY 

8772
04:34:21,310 --> 04:34:22,612
STILL SWAYABLE AT THIS POINT 

8773
04:34:22,612 --> 04:34:23,380
WHO ARE GOING TO ULTIMATELY 

8774
04:34:23,380 --> 04:34:25,814
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO MOVE 

8775
04:34:25,814 --> 04:34:26,482
FORWARD WITH THIS CONFIRMATION. 

8776
04:34:26,482 --> 04:34:26,782
>> RIGHT. 

8777
04:34:26,782 --> 04:34:28,318
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT QUESTION 

8778
04:34:28,318 --> 04:34:29,485
OF MEMORY FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE 

8779
04:34:29,485 --> 04:34:30,954
DR. FORD DISCUSSED IT, AND SHE 

8780
04:34:30,954 --> 04:34:31,988
SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ARE 

8781
04:34:31,988 --> 04:34:33,723
THE VICTIM OF AN ASSAULT LIKE 

8782
04:34:33,723 --> 04:34:34,991
THAT, AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 

8783
04:34:34,991 --> 04:34:35,958
EARLIER, THERE ARE CERTAIN 

8784
04:34:35,958 --> 04:34:38,061
THINGS THAT JUST REMAIN IN YOUR 

8785
04:34:38,061 --> 04:34:39,095
MIND CRYSTAL CLEAR. 

8786
04:34:39,095 --> 04:34:41,197
NOW, IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

8787
04:34:41,197 --> 04:34:42,331
MEMORY OF THE ATTACKER, IF THIS 

8788
04:34:42,331 --> 04:34:45,702
WAS NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL TO THE 

8789
04:34:45,702 --> 04:34:47,136
ATTACKER, THEN PERHAPS THERE 

8790
04:34:47,136 --> 04:34:49,472
ARE NO ELEMENTS OF IT THAT 

8791
04:34:49,472 --> 04:34:52,676
REMAIN IN HIS MEMORY IN SUCH A 

8792
04:34:52,676 --> 04:34:53,241
CLEAR MANNER. 

8793
04:34:53,241 --> 04:34:55,145
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS DID NO THE 

8794
04:34:55,145 --> 04:34:58,448
HAVE SUCH A GRAND -- THIS DID 

8795
04:34:58,448 --> 04:35:01,484
NOT HAVE SUCH A GRAND AFFECT ON 

8796
04:35:01,484 --> 04:35:02,752
-- OH, WE WILL PICK THIS UP 

8797
04:35:02,752 --> 04:35:04,621
LATER BECAUSE DR. FORD JUST SAT 

8798
04:35:04,621 --> 04:35:04,954
BACK DOWN. 

8799
04:35:04,954 --> 04:35:05,955
SHE'S NOT GOING TO START 

8800
04:35:05,955 --> 04:35:07,057
SPEAKING RIGHT AWAY, BUT JUST 

8801
04:35:07,057 --> 04:35:08,957
REQUESTING, DO YOU THINK IT IS 

8802
04:35:08,957 --> 04:35:09,559
THEN POSSIBLE THAT THE 

8803
04:35:09,559 --> 04:35:11,328
ATTACKER, IF THE EVENT DOES NOT 

8804
04:35:11,328 --> 04:35:12,128
HAVE THE SAME LIFETIME EFFECT 

8805
04:35:12,128 --> 04:35:14,898
ON THEM DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME 

8806
04:35:14,898 --> 04:35:15,364
MEMORY OF IT? 

8807
04:35:15,364 --> 04:35:15,831
>> RIGHT. 

8808
04:35:15,831 --> 04:35:18,768
THIS IS GOING TO BE -- AGAIN, 

8809
04:35:18,768 --> 04:35:20,270
GOING BACK TO THE VERY 

8810
04:35:20,270 --> 04:35:21,170
BEGINNING IN WHICH KAVANAUGH 

8811
04:35:21,170 --> 04:35:22,472
SAYS THAT HE WASN'T AT THIS 

8812
04:35:22,472 --> 04:35:22,705
PARTY. 

8813
04:35:22,705 --> 04:35:22,972
>> RIGHT. 

8814
04:35:22,972 --> 04:35:25,942
>> AND THAT HE DIDN'T DO THIS. 

8815
04:35:25,942 --> 04:35:27,711
AGAIN, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THEN 

8816
04:35:27,711 --> 04:35:30,279
TO DEEFATE FROM THAT IF THAT -- 

8817
04:35:30,279 --> 04:35:33,183
DEVIATE FROM THAT IF THAT IS 

8818
04:35:33,183 --> 04:35:33,817
YOUR OVERARCHING ARGUMENT THE 

8819
04:35:33,817 --> 04:35:34,150
WHOLE THING. 

8820
04:35:34,150 --> 04:35:35,952
>> IT COULD BE HIS ARGUMENT 

8821
04:35:35,952 --> 04:35:37,152
THAT HE DIDN'T DO IT, RIGHT? 

8822
04:35:37,152 --> 04:35:37,419
>> MAYBE. 

8823
04:35:37,419 --> 04:35:38,921
BUT YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE 

8824
04:35:38,921 --> 04:35:42,458
COMPANY HE KEPT AND HE KEPT 

8825
04:35:42,458 --> 04:35:44,194
COMPANY WITH SOMEBODY WITH VERY 

8826
04:35:44,194 --> 04:35:45,562
LEWD BEHAVIOR, KIND OF 

8827
04:35:45,562 --> 04:35:46,562
CHARACTERIZING THAT MOMENT IN 

8828
04:35:46,562 --> 04:35:46,762
TIME. 

8829
04:35:46,762 --> 04:35:47,897
SO IT'S VERY HARD BY 

8830
04:35:47,897 --> 04:35:49,132
ASSOCIATION TO SAY YOU WERE 

8831
04:35:49,132 --> 04:35:51,600
NEVER AROUND THAT KIND OF 

8832
04:35:51,600 --> 04:35:53,069
ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU WERE. 

8833
04:35:53,069 --> 04:35:53,436
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

8834
04:35:53,436 --> 04:35:55,372
I THINK THAT IS THE PART OF HIS 

8835
04:35:55,372 --> 04:35:58,741
PAST THAT WE STILL NEED TO HEAR 

8836
04:35:58,741 --> 04:36:00,242
HIM SPEAK HONESTLY AND OPENLY 

8837
04:36:00,242 --> 04:36:00,543
ABOUT. 

8838
04:36:00,543 --> 04:36:02,746
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE ABOUT TO 

8839
04:36:02,746 --> 04:36:12,088
BEGIN, SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE 

8840
04:36:12,088 --> 04:36:17,526
HEARING WITH DR. BLASEY FORD. 

8841
04:36:17,526 --> 04:36:18,161
>> I'M READY. 

8842
04:36:18,161 --> 04:36:19,028
>> SENATOR HIRONO. 

8843
04:36:19,028 --> 04:36:20,028
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

8844
04:36:20,028 --> 04:36:22,331
MR. CHAIRMAN, IS IT YOUR INTENT 

8845
04:36:22,331 --> 04:36:24,034
TO CEDE ALL REPUBLICAN 

8846
04:36:24,034 --> 04:36:26,101
SENATORS' TIME TO YOUR 

8847
04:36:26,101 --> 04:36:27,003
PROSECUTOR RATHER THAN THEY 

8848
04:36:27,003 --> 04:36:31,641
THEMSELVES CEDING THEIR TIME TO 

8849
04:36:31,641 --> 04:36:32,042
HER? 

8850
04:36:32,042 --> 04:36:34,276
>> WE ALL KNOW THE PROSECUTOR, 

8851
04:36:34,276 --> 04:36:36,613
EVEN THOUGH THIS CLEARLY IS NOT 

8852
04:36:36,613 --> 04:36:38,748
A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IS ASKING 

8853
04:36:38,748 --> 04:36:40,116
DR. FORD ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS 

8854
04:36:40,116 --> 04:36:42,218
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE AND 

8855
04:36:42,218 --> 04:36:46,523
AFTER, BUT BASICALLY NOT DURING 

8856
04:36:46,523 --> 04:36:47,155
THE ATTACK. 

8857
04:36:47,155 --> 04:36:48,792
THE PROSECUTOR SHOULD KNOW THAT 

8858
04:36:48,792 --> 04:36:50,193
SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS OFTEN 

8859
04:36:50,193 --> 04:36:51,061
DO NOT REMEMBER PERIPHERAL 

8860
04:36:51,061 --> 04:36:52,195
INFORMATION SUCH AS WHAT 

8861
04:36:52,195 --> 04:36:54,029
HAPPENED BEFORE OR AFTER THE 

8862
04:36:54,029 --> 04:36:55,532
TRAUMATIC EVENT, AND YET SHE 

8863
04:36:55,532 --> 04:36:59,035
WILL PERSIST IN ASKING THESE 

8864
04:36:59,035 --> 04:37:00,537
QUESTIONS ALL TO UNDERMINE THE 

8865
04:37:00,537 --> 04:37:01,738
MEMORY AND BASICALLY THE 

8866
04:37:01,738 --> 04:37:03,404
CREDIBILITY OF DR. FORD. 

8867
04:37:03,404 --> 04:37:06,910
BUT WE ALL KNOW DR. FORD'S 

8868
04:37:06,910 --> 04:37:13,249
MEMORY OF THE ASSAULT IS VERY 

8869
04:37:13,249 --> 04:37:13,482
CLEAR. 

8870
04:37:13,482 --> 04:37:14,184
DR. FORD, THE REPUBLICAN'S 

8871
04:37:14,184 --> 04:37:14,984
PROSECUTOR HAS ASKED YOU ALL 

8872
04:37:14,984 --> 04:37:17,087
KINDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO 

8873
04:37:17,087 --> 04:37:19,022
YOU CALLED AND WHEN, ASKING 

8874
04:37:19,022 --> 04:37:20,723
DETAILS THAT WOULD BE ASKED IN 

8875
04:37:20,723 --> 04:37:22,991
A CROSS EXAMINATION OF A 

8876
04:37:22,991 --> 04:37:25,195
WITNESS IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL, 

8877
04:37:25,195 --> 04:37:28,465
BUT THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 

8878
04:37:28,465 --> 04:37:28,765
PROCEEDING. 

8879
04:37:28,765 --> 04:37:29,466
THIS IS A CONFIRMATION 

8880
04:37:29,466 --> 04:37:29,766
PROCEEDING. 

8881
04:37:29,766 --> 04:37:32,134
I THINK I KNOW WHAT SHE'S 

8882
04:37:32,134 --> 04:37:33,101
TRYING TO GET AT. 

8883
04:37:33,101 --> 04:37:35,004
SO I'LL JUST ASK YOU VERY 

8884
04:37:35,004 --> 04:37:37,706
PLAINLY, DR. FORD, IS THERE A 

8885
04:37:37,706 --> 04:37:38,741
POLITICAL MOTIVATION FOR YOUR 

8886
04:37:38,741 --> 04:37:41,177
COMING FORWARD WITH YOUR 

8887
04:37:41,177 --> 04:37:45,547
ACCOUNT OF THE ASSAULT BY BRETT 

8888
04:37:45,547 --> 04:37:45,848
KAVANAUGH? 

8889
04:37:45,848 --> 04:37:46,080
>> NO. 

8890
04:37:46,080 --> 04:37:46,749
AND I'D LIKE TO REITERATE AGAIN 

8891
04:37:46,749 --> 04:37:48,451
THAT I WAS TRYING TO GET THE 

8892
04:37:48,451 --> 04:37:51,854
INFORMATION TO YOU WHILE THERE 

8893
04:37:51,854 --> 04:37:55,724
WAS STILL A LIST OF OTHER WHAT 

8894
04:37:55,724 --> 04:37:56,793
LOOKED LIKE EQUALLY QUALIFIED 

8895
04:37:56,793 --> 04:37:57,093
CANDIDATES. 

8896
04:37:57,093 --> 04:37:58,761
>> AND YET THEY'RE NOT HERE TO 

8897
04:37:58,761 --> 04:37:59,028
TESTIFY. 

8898
04:37:59,028 --> 04:38:01,965
DR. FORD, I'D LIKE TO JOIN ME 

8899
04:38:01,965 --> 04:38:04,734
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE THANKED YOU 

8900
04:38:04,734 --> 04:38:06,236
FOR COMING FORWARD TODAY AND I 

8901
04:38:06,236 --> 04:38:07,837

04:38:07,837 --> 04:38:09,973
YOU ARE DOING, AND I UNDERSTAND

WHY YOU HAVE COME FORWARD. 

8904
04:38:11,106 --> 04:38:13,008
YOU WANTED US AND THE AMERICAN 

8905
04:38:13,008 --> 04:38:15,511
PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNEW 

8906
04:38:15,511 --> 04:38:16,846
ABOUT THE CHARACTER, THE 

8907
04:38:16,846 --> 04:38:19,415
CHARACTER OF THE MAN WE ARE 

8908
04:38:19,415 --> 04:38:23,186
CONSIDERING FOR A LIFETIME 

8909
04:38:23,186 --> 04:38:24,354
APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME 

8910
04:38:24,354 --> 04:38:24,587
COURT. 

8911
04:38:24,587 --> 04:38:26,722
>> I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT ALSO 

8912
04:38:26,722 --> 04:38:27,924
TO NOTE THE SIGNIFICANT 

8913
04:38:27,924 --> 04:38:29,125
PERSONAL SACRIFICE YOU'VE COME 

8914
04:38:29,125 --> 04:38:31,794
FORWARD TO SHARE YOUR TRAUMATIC 

8915
04:38:31,794 --> 04:38:33,963
EXPERIENCE WITH US AND THE 

8916
04:38:33,963 --> 04:38:34,363
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

8917
04:38:34,363 --> 04:38:40,470
YOU'VE HAD TO MOVE, YOU'VE HAD 

8918
04:38:40,470 --> 04:38:44,908
DEATH THREATS, ALL IN A MANNER 

8919
04:38:44,908 --> 04:38:45,809
OF -- BASICALLY 

8920
04:38:45,809 --> 04:38:46,409
REVICTIMMIZATION EXPERIENCES 

8921
04:38:46,409 --> 04:38:47,811
HAVE COME YOUR WAY, BUT BY 

8922
04:38:47,811 --> 04:38:49,612
COMING FORWARD YOU HAVE 

8923
04:38:49,612 --> 04:38:51,447
INSERTED THE QUESTION OF 

8924
04:38:51,447 --> 04:38:52,848
CHARACTER INTO THIS NOMINATION 

8925
04:38:52,848 --> 04:38:54,551
AND HOPEFULLY BACK INTO 

8926
04:38:54,551 --> 04:38:55,884
AMERICAN LIFE AND RIGHTLY SO. 

8927
04:38:55,884 --> 04:39:00,223
WE SHOULD BE MADE TO FACE A 

8928
04:39:00,223 --> 04:39:01,758
QUESTION OF WHERE DOES PUTTING 

8929
04:39:01,758 --> 04:39:02,826
IN POSITIONS OF POWER AND 

8930
04:39:02,826 --> 04:39:03,893
DECISION MAKING IN THIS 

8931
04:39:03,893 --> 04:39:04,993
COUNTRY, WE SHOULD LOOK THE 

8932
04:39:04,993 --> 04:39:07,029
QUESTION SQUARE IN THE FACE, 

8933
04:39:07,029 --> 04:39:08,431
DOES CHARACTER MATTER, DO OUR 

8934
04:39:08,431 --> 04:39:09,598
VALUES, OUR REAL VALUES ABOUT 

8935
04:39:09,598 --> 04:39:11,600
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG 

8936
04:39:11,600 --> 04:39:13,902
AND ABOUT WHETHER WE TREAT OUR 

8937
04:39:13,902 --> 04:39:16,205
FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS WITH 

8938
04:39:16,205 --> 04:39:17,373
DIGNITY AND RESPECT, DO THEY 

8939
04:39:17,373 --> 04:39:17,973
MATTER ANYMORE? 

8940
04:39:17,973 --> 04:39:18,641
I BELIEVE THEY DO. 

8941
04:39:18,641 --> 04:39:21,911
AND I BELIEVE THE REACTION WE 

8942
04:39:21,911 --> 04:39:23,512
HAVE SEEN TO THIS COVERAGE 

8943
04:39:23,512 --> 04:39:25,148
RIGHT NOW AND YOUR COURAGE ALL 

8944
04:39:25,148 --> 04:39:29,085
OVER THIS COUNTRY SHOWS US THAT 

8945
04:39:29,085 --> 04:39:29,518
WE'RE NOT ALONE. 

8946
04:39:29,518 --> 04:39:30,919
YOU'RE NOT ALONE, THAT WOMEN 

8947
04:39:30,919 --> 04:39:32,622
AND MEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA ARE 

8948
04:39:32,622 --> 04:39:35,724
DISGUSTED AND SICK AND TIRED OF 

8949
04:39:35,724 --> 04:39:36,626
THE WAY BASIC HUMAN DECENCY HAS 

8950
04:39:36,626 --> 04:39:39,128
BEEN DRIVEN FROM OUR PUBLIC 

8951
04:39:39,128 --> 04:39:39,328
LIFE. 

8952
04:39:39,328 --> 04:39:41,931
THE PRESIDENT ADMITS ON TAPE TO 

8953
04:39:41,931 --> 04:39:42,331
ASSAULTING WOMEN. 

8954
04:39:42,331 --> 04:39:44,167
HE SEPARATES CHILDREN FROM 

8955
04:39:44,167 --> 04:39:46,069
THEIR PARENT, HE TAKES BASIC 

8956
04:39:46,069 --> 04:39:47,804
HEALTHCARE PROTECTIONS FROM 

8957
04:39:47,804 --> 04:39:48,905
THOSE WHO NEED THEM MOST, HE 

8958
04:39:48,905 --> 04:39:52,008
NOMINATES AND STANDS BEHIND A 

8959
04:39:52,008 --> 04:39:54,677
MAN WHO STANDS CREDIBLY ACCUSED 

8960
04:39:54,677 --> 04:39:55,110
OF A HORRIBLE ACT. 

8961
04:39:55,110 --> 04:40:01,451
I AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 

8962
04:40:01,451 --> 04:40:01,818
COMING FORWARD. 

8963
04:40:01,818 --> 04:40:03,553
MR. CHAIRMAN, I ASK UNANIMOUS 

8964
04:40:03,553 --> 04:40:06,489
CONSENT THAT SIX ITEMS 

8965
04:40:06,489 --> 04:40:08,758
CONSISTING OF VARIOUS

04:40:11,093 --> 04:40:11,327

>> IS THAT ONE REQUEST OR YOU 

8970
04:40:13,229 --> 04:40:14,898
WANT ME TO WAIT FOR SIX? 

8971
04:40:14,898 --> 04:40:17,433
>> WELL, I HAVE SIX SEPARATE 

8972
04:40:17,433 --> 04:40:17,666
ITEMS. 

8973
04:40:17,666 --> 04:40:17,933
>> OKAY. 

8974
04:40:17,933 --> 04:40:21,204
>> I CAN GO OVER THEM FOR YOU. 

8975
04:40:21,204 --> 04:40:21,504
>> OKAY. 

8976
04:40:21,504 --> 04:40:21,671
NO. 

8977
04:40:21,671 --> 04:40:23,539
>> I WOULD LIKE TO -- 

8978
04:40:23,539 --> 04:40:25,575
>> LET ME NOT INTERRUPT YOU. 

8979
04:40:25,575 --> 04:40:28,010
YOUR REQUEST IS ACCEPTED 

8980
04:40:28,010 --> 04:40:28,444
WITHOUT OBJECTION. 

8981
04:40:28,444 --> 04:40:29,946
>> THANK YOU. 

8982
04:40:29,946 --> 04:40:33,149
AND I WOULD LIKE TO READ FROM 

8983
04:40:33,149 --> 04:40:34,350
AN ITEM THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN 

8984
04:40:34,350 --> 04:40:36,452
ENTERED INTO THE RECORD, BUT 

8985
04:40:36,452 --> 04:40:37,921
THIS IS FROM A LETTER FROM THE 

8986
04:40:37,921 --> 04:40:40,523
NATIONAL TASK FORCE TO END 

8987
04:40:40,523 --> 04:40:41,657
SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 

8988
04:40:41,657 --> 04:40:44,727
THE LETTER STATES, AND I QUOTE 

8989
04:40:44,727 --> 04:40:46,362
THIS LETTER, THIS MOMENT HAS 

8990
04:40:46,362 --> 04:40:47,129
BECOME A CREW CYBIL. 

8991
04:40:47,129 --> 04:40:49,264
IT'S A TEST OF OUR PROGRESS. 

8992
04:40:49,264 --> 04:40:50,066
DO WE START BY BELIEVING 

8993
04:40:50,066 --> 04:40:51,935
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND 

8994
04:40:51,935 --> 04:40:53,937
TREATING THEM WITH DIGNITY OR 

8995
04:40:53,937 --> 04:40:54,903
DON'T WE? 

8996
04:40:54,903 --> 04:40:57,340
SO FAR SENATE LEADERS ARE 

8997
04:40:57,340 --> 04:40:59,008
FAILING THAT TEST. 

8998
04:40:59,008 --> 04:41:02,078
PREJUDGING THE OUTCOME OF THE 

8999
04:41:02,078 --> 04:41:04,380
HEARING, SYMPATHIZING WITH HER 

9000
04:41:04,380 --> 04:41:05,481
PERPETRATE ROR, -- PERPETRATOR, 

9001
04:41:05,481 --> 04:41:06,048
ATTACKING HER CREDIBILITY. 

9002
04:41:06,048 --> 04:41:07,684
THEY SEND A MESSAGE TO EVERY 

9003
04:41:07,684 --> 04:41:09,986
VICTIM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT 

9004
04:41:09,986 --> 04:41:13,389
THEIR PAIN DOESN'T MATTER, THAT 

9005
04:41:13,389 --> 04:41:14,324
THEY DO NOT DESERVE JUSTICE AND 

9006
04:41:14,324 --> 04:41:17,493
THAT FOR THEM FAIR TREATMENT IS 

9007
04:41:17,493 --> 04:41:18,728
OUT OF REACH. 

9008
04:41:18,728 --> 04:41:22,131
THIS WILL ONLY SERVE TO DRIVE 

9009
04:41:22,131 --> 04:41:26,635
VICTIMS INTO THE SHADOWS AND 

9010
04:41:26,635 --> 04:41:27,403
FURTHER EMBOLDENING ABUSERS. 

9011
04:41:27,403 --> 04:41:28,604
ONCE AGAIN, DR. FORD, THANK YOU 

9012
04:41:28,604 --> 04:41:28,904
VERY MUCH. 

9013
04:41:28,904 --> 04:41:38,314
THIS IS A MOMENT FOR OUR 

9014
04:41:38,314 --> 04:41:38,915
COUNTRY. 

9015
04:41:38,915 --> 04:41:39,148
MAHALO. 

9016
04:41:39,148 --> 04:41:42,051
>> SENATOR -- MS. MITCHEL FOR 

9017
04:41:42,051 --> 04:41:42,418
SENATOR CRAPPO. 

9018
04:41:42,418 --> 04:41:42,885
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 

9019
04:41:42,885 --> 04:41:43,118
>> HI. 

9020
04:41:43,118 --> 04:41:46,789
>> WHEN WE LEFT OFF WE WERE 

9021
04:41:46,789 --> 04:41:47,657
STILL TALKING ABOUT THE 

9022
04:41:47,657 --> 04:41:49,359
POLYGRAPH, AND I BELIEVE YOU 

9023
04:41:49,359 --> 04:41:55,664
SAID IT HASN'T BEEN PAID FOR 

9024
04:41:55,664 --> 04:41:56,498
YET, IS THAT CORRECT? 

9025
04:41:56,498 --> 04:41:58,701
>> LET ME PUT AN END TO THIS 

9026
04:41:58,701 --> 04:42:02,572
MISERY, HER LAWYERS HAVE PAID 

9027
04:42:02,572 --> 04:42:03,773
FOR HER POLYGRAPH. 

9028
04:42:03,773 --> 04:42:08,010
>> AS IS ROUTINE. 

9029
04:42:08,010 --> 04:42:08,644
>> AS IS ROUTINE. 

9030
04:42:08,644 --> 04:42:10,546
>> DR. FORD, DO YOU EXPECT THAT 

9031
04:42:10,546 --> 04:42:13,783
THE PRICE OF THAT POLYGRAPH TO 

9032
04:42:13,783 --> 04:42:15,018
BE PASSED ON TO YOU? 

9033
04:42:15,018 --> 04:42:16,719
>> I'M NOT SURE YET. 

9034
04:42:16,719 --> 04:42:19,856
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A LOOK AT ALL 

9035
04:42:19,856 --> 04:42:22,458
OF THE CLASS INVOLVED IN THIS. 

9036
04:42:22,458 --> 04:42:24,260
WE'VE RELOCATED NOW -- ALL OF 

9037
04:42:24,260 --> 04:42:26,095
THE COSTS INVOLVED IN THIS. 

9038
04:42:26,095 --> 04:42:26,930
WE'VE NOW RELOCATEDTWICE, AND 

9039
04:42:26,930 --> 04:42:28,664
I HAVEN'T KEPT TRACK OF THIS 

9040
04:42:28,664 --> 04:42:28,964
PAPERWORK. 

9041
04:42:28,964 --> 04:42:30,266
BUT I'M SURE I HAVE A LOT OF 

9042
04:42:30,266 --> 04:42:32,068
WORK TO DO TO CATCH UP ON THAT 

9043
04:42:32,068 --> 04:42:32,301
LATER. 

9044
04:42:32,301 --> 04:42:33,870
>> I GET YOU HAVE A LOT GOING 

9045
04:42:33,870 --> 04:42:35,838
ON AND YOU'VE HAD THAT FOR 

9046
04:42:35,838 --> 04:42:36,205
SEVERAL MONTHS. 

9047
04:42:36,205 --> 04:42:37,239
BUT IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING 

9048
04:42:37,239 --> 04:42:39,409
THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO 

9049
04:42:39,409 --> 04:42:42,378
ASSIST YOU WITH SOME OF THESE 

9050
04:42:42,378 --> 04:42:44,747
FEES INCLUDING THE COSTS FOR 

9051
04:42:44,747 --> 04:42:45,114
YOUR POLYGRAPH? 

9052
04:42:45,114 --> 04:42:47,950
>> I'M AWARE THAT THERE'S BEEN 

9053
04:42:47,950 --> 04:42:49,052
SEVERAL GOFUNDME SITES THAT I 

9054
04:42:49,052 --> 04:42:50,653
HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FIGURE 

9055
04:42:50,653 --> 04:42:53,222
OUT HOW TO MANAGE THOSE BECAUSE 

9056
04:42:53,222 --> 04:42:54,924
I'VE NEVER HAD ONE. 

9057
04:42:54,924 --> 04:42:56,025
>> SEVERAL WHAT? 

9058
04:42:56,025 --> 04:42:58,628
>> GOFUNDME SITES THAT HAVE 

9059
04:42:58,628 --> 04:42:59,762
RAISED MONEY PRIMARILY FOR OUR 

9060
04:42:59,762 --> 04:43:01,197
SECURITY DETAIL, SO I'M NOT 

9061
04:43:01,197 --> 04:43:02,798
EVEN QUITE SURE HOW TO COLLECT 

9062
04:43:02,798 --> 04:43:04,200
THAT MONEY OR HOW TO DISTRIBUTE 

9063
04:43:04,200 --> 04:43:04,533
IT YET. 

9064
04:43:04,533 --> 04:43:12,141
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS ON 

9065
04:43:12,141 --> 04:43:12,341
THAT. 

9066
04:43:12,341 --> 04:43:12,608
>> OKAY. 

9067
04:43:12,608 --> 04:43:15,745
IN YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING 

9068
04:43:15,745 --> 04:43:16,846
YOU STATED THAT SENATOR 

9069
04:43:16,846 --> 04:43:18,080
FEINSTEIN SENT YOU A LETTER ON 

9070
04:43:18,080 --> 04:43:35,031
AUGUST 31st OF THIS YEAR, IS 

9071
04:43:35,031 --> 04:43:36,365
THAT RIGHT? 

9072
04:43:36,365 --> 04:43:38,067
>> AUGUST 31st. 

9073
04:43:38,067 --> 04:43:38,367
LET ME SEE. 

9074
04:43:38,367 --> 04:43:39,869
I SENT HER A LETTER ON JULY 

9075
04:43:39,869 --> 04:43:42,238
30th, AND I DON'T HAVE THE 

9076
04:43:42,238 --> 04:43:42,471
DATE. 

9077
04:43:42,471 --> 04:43:44,040
I'D HAVE TO TO PULL UP MY E-

9078
04:43:44,040 --> 04:43:46,208

9079
04:43:46,208 --> 04:43:47,843
HER E-MAIL TO ME SAYING -- IT 

9080
04:43:47,843 --> 04:43:50,212
WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE HEARINGS 

9081
04:43:50,212 --> 04:43:54,650
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MAINTAIN 

9082
04:43:54,650 --> 04:43:55,718
THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE 

9083
04:43:55,718 --> 04:43:55,951
LETTER. 

9084
04:43:55,951 --> 04:43:56,452
>> SAY THAT AGAIN. 

9085
04:43:56,452 --> 04:43:59,055
IT WAS STILL RIGHT BEFORE THE 

9086
04:43:59,055 --> 04:43:59,322
HEARINGS? 

9087
04:43:59,322 --> 04:44:00,123
>> THAT'S MY MEMORY, BUT I CAN 

9088
04:44:00,123 --> 04:44:01,691
LOOK IT UP FOR YOU IF YOU'D 

9089
04:44:01,691 --> 04:44:02,325
LIKE THE EXACT DATE. 

9090
04:44:02,325 --> 04:44:04,927
I CAN PULL IT UP ON MY E-MAIL. 

9091
04:44:04,927 --> 04:44:06,328

9093
04:44:07,929 --> 04:44:10,066
>> I WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU 

9094
04:44:10,066 --> 04:44:10,700
UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID. 

9095
04:44:10,700 --> 04:44:11,968
>> THAT DOCUMENT HAS BEEN 

9096
04:44:11,968 --> 04:44:13,770
TURNED OVER IN RESPONSE TO 

9097
04:44:13,770 --> 04:44:14,470
REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS. 

9098

9099
04:44:15,070 --> 04:44:16,338
>> THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

04:44:16,338 --> 04:44:18,908
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I 

9101
04:44:18,908 --> 04:44:19,775
UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID. 

9102
04:44:19,775 --> 04:44:21,944
WAS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IT 

9103
04:44:21,944 --> 04:44:22,745
WAS GOING TO BE KEPT 

9104
04:44:22,745 --> 04:44:25,148
CONFIDENTIAL UP UNTIL RIGHT 

9105
04:44:25,148 --> 04:44:26,115
BEFORE THE HEARING? 

9106
04:44:26,115 --> 04:44:28,584
>> IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 

9107
04:44:28,584 --> 04:44:36,259

CONFIDENTIAL PERIOD. 

9109
04:44:36,726 --> 04:44:38,428
>> PERIOD? 

9110
04:44:38,428 --> 04:44:38,628
OKAY. 

9111
04:44:38,628 --> 04:44:39,829
BETWEEN YOUR POLYGRAPH ON

04:44:39,829 --> 04:44:42,765
AUGUST THE 7th AND YOUR RECEIPT 

9113
04:44:42,765 --> 04:44:44,666
OF THE LETTER FROM SENATOR 

9114
04:44:44,666 --> 04:44:47,036
FEINSTEIN, DID YOU OR ANYONE ON

04:44:47,036 --> 04:44:49,572
YOUR BEHALF SPEAK TO ANY MEMBER 

9116
04:44:49,572 --> 04:44:55,011
OF CONGRESS OR CONGRESSIONAL 

9117
04:44:55,011 --> 04:44:56,845
STAFF ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS? 

9118
04:44:56,845 --> 04:44:57,412
>> I PERSONALLY DID NOT. 

9119
04:44:57,412 --> 04:45:00,783
>> SO MY QUESTION WAS DID YOU 

9120
04:45:00,783 --> 04:45:02,951
OR ANYBODY ON YOUR BEHALF? 

9121
04:45:02,951 --> 04:45:04,520
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DID 

9122
04:45:04,520 --> 04:45:05,888
SOMEONE SPEAK FOR ME? 

9123
04:45:05,888 --> 04:45:08,324
>> SOMEBODY THAT IS WORKING 

9124
04:45:08,324 --> 04:45:10,860
WITH YOU OR HELPING YOU, DID 

9125
04:45:10,860 --> 04:45:13,029
SOMEBODY AT YOUR BEHEST ON YOUR 

9126
04:45:13,029 --> 04:45:14,597
BEHALF SPEAK TO SOMEBODY IN 

9127
04:45:14,597 --> 04:45:16,031
CONGRESS OR A STAFF? 

9128
04:45:16,031 --> 04:45:16,799
>> I'M NOT SURE. 

9129
04:45:16,799 --> 04:45:18,201
I'M NOT SURE HOW THOSE 

9130
04:45:18,201 --> 04:45:18,935
EXCHANGES WENT. 

9131
04:45:18,935 --> 04:45:23,005
BUT I DIDN'T SPEAK TO ANYONE. 

9132
04:45:23,005 --> 04:45:25,141
>> OKAY. 

9133
04:45:25,141 --> 04:45:26,909
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOMEBODY 

9134
04:45:26,909 --> 04:45:27,109
DID? 

9135
04:45:27,109 --> 04:45:31,180
>> I THINK SO, IT WOULD BE 

9136
04:45:31,180 --> 04:45:31,447
POSSIBLE. 

9137
04:45:31,447 --> 04:45:34,250
I'M GUESSING IT WOULD BE 

9138
04:45:34,250 --> 04:45:35,250
POSSIBLE, BUT I DON'T KNOW. 

9139
04:45:35,250 --> 04:45:35,617
>> EXCUSE ME. 

9140
04:45:35,617 --> 04:45:37,486
YOU ASKED HER NOT TO GUESS AND 

9141
04:45:37,486 --> 04:45:38,354
NOW YOU'RE ASKING HER WHAT'S 

9142
04:45:38,354 --> 04:45:40,089
POSSIBLE, SO I THINK IF YOU 

9143
04:45:40,089 --> 04:45:40,990
WANT TO ASK HER WHAT SHE KNOWS, 

9144
04:45:40,990 --> 04:45:43,826
YOU SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE 

9145
04:45:43,826 --> 04:45:44,060
KNOWS. 

9146
04:45:44,060 --> 04:45:45,461
>> IS THAT A REJECTION, 

9147
04:45:45,461 --> 04:45:45,728
COUNSEL? 

9148
04:45:45,728 --> 04:45:46,562
>> IT IS A REJECTION. 

9149
04:45:46,562 --> 04:45:55,004
>> I'LL HAVE THE CHAIR RULE ON 

9150
04:45:55,004 --> 04:45:59,475
THAT.

WE HAVE A WONDERFUL NATION, AN 

9300
04:50:28,777 --> 04:50:30,913
INCREDIBLE CULTURE, BUT THERE 

9301
04:50:30,913 --> 04:50:34,750
ARE DARK ELEMENTS THAT ALLOW 

9302
04:50:34,750 --> 04:50:36,418
UNCONCHENNABLE LEVELS OF UN -- 

9303
04:50:36,418 --> 04:50:37,920
UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF SEXUAL 

9304
04:50:37,920 --> 04:50:38,888

COUNTRY. 

9313
04:50:53,135 --> 04:50:55,004
I STEPPED OUT DURING THE BREAK 

9314
04:50:55,004 --> 04:50:57,206
AND WAS DELUGED WITH NOTES FROM 

9315
04:50:57,206 --> 04:50:58,441
FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, 

9316
04:50:58,441 --> 04:50:59,408
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THAT THERE

9318
04:51:00,643 --> 04:51:02,711
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WATCHING 

9319
04:51:02,711 --> 04:51:03,979
YOUR TESTIMONY RIGHT NOW AND 

9320
04:51:03,979 --> 04:51:06,482
NOTE AFTER NOTE THAT I GOT 

9321
04:51:06,482 --> 04:51:08,350
PEOPLE IN TEARS, FEELING PAIN 

9322
04:51:08,350 --> 04:51:09,852
AND ANGUISH, NOT JUST FEELING 

9323
04:51:09,852 --> 04:51:12,888
YOUR PAIN, BUT FEELING THEIR 

9324
04:51:12,888 --> 04:51:15,757
OWN WHO HAVE NOT COME FORWARD. 

9325
04:51:15,757 --> 04:51:17,025
YOU ARE OPENING UP TO OPEN-AIR 

9326
04:51:17,025 --> 04:51:19,828
HURT AND PAIN THAT GOES ON 

9327
04:51:19,828 --> 04:51:20,729
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 

9328
04:51:20,729 --> 04:51:22,932
AND FOR THAT THE WORD I WOULD 

9329
04:51:22,932 --> 04:51:24,166
USE, IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF 

9330
04:51:24,166 --> 04:51:26,268

TRYING TO BLAME THE PERSON, I 

9514
04:57:33,669 --> 04:57:34,569
JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S RIGHT 

9515
04:57:34,569 --> 04:57:36,838
FOR US TO BE TALKING ABOUT 

9516
04:57:36,838 --> 04:57:37,038
THAT. 

9517
04:57:37,038 --> 04:57:38,106
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO BLAME 

9518
04:57:38,106 --> 04:57:38,373
ANYBODY. 

9519
04:57:38,373 --> 04:57:39,674

9523
04:57:46,848 --> 04:57:47,248
MR. KAVANAUGH. 

9524
04:57:47,248 --> 04:57:47,515
>> OKAY. 

9525
04:57:47,515 --> 04:57:53,956

PERSON? 

9527
04:57:54,189 --> 04:57:55,991
>> MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS WE 

9528
04:57:55,991 --> 04:57:57,292
SOCIALIZED, BUT HE ALSO WAS A 

9529
04:57:57,292 --> 04:57:59,027
MEMBER OF THE SAME COUNTRY CLUB 

9530
04:57:59,027 --> 04:58:01,296
AND I KNEW HIS YOUNGER BROTHER 

9531
04:58:01,296 --> 04:58:02,164
AS WELL. 

9532
04:58:02,164 --> 04:58:02,431
>> OKAY. 

9533
04:58:02,431 --> 04:58:08,837

9535
04:58:09,137 --> 04:58:09,404

9536
04:58:09,404 --> 04:58:09,671
>> OKAY. 

9537
04:58:09,671 --> 04:58:11,239
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE YOUR 

9538
04:58:11,239 --> 04:58:12,708
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BOTH 

9539
04:58:12,708 --> 04:58:17,245

PLACE, THIS PERSON? 

9541
04:58:18,046 --> 04:58:20,282
>> HE WAS SOMEBODY THAT -- WE 

9542
04:58:20,282 --> 04:58:21,650

I WOULDN'T SAY DATE, I WENT OUT 

9544
04:58:25,320 --> 04:58:26,121

9545
04:58:26,121 --> 04:58:28,991
THAT'S HOW HE TERMED IT AT THE 

9546
04:58:28,991 --> 04:58:29,191
TIME. 

9547
04:58:29,191 --> 04:58:31,026
AND AFTER THAT WE WERE DISTANT 

9548
04:58:31,026 --> 04:58:34,062
FRIENDS AND RAN INTO EACH OTHER 

9549
04:58:34,062 --> 04:58:35,030
PERIODICALLY AT COLUMBIA 

9550

I SAW HIS BROTHER AND HIM 

9553
04:58:41,570 --> 04:58:42,004
SEVERAL TIMES. 

9554
04:58:42,004 --> 04:58:44,606

9555
04:58:44,606 --> 04:58:46,875
COMMON LINK BETWEEN YOU AND 

9556
04:58:46,875 --> 04:58:47,442

9560
04:58:55,250 --> 04:58:57,385
BUT YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN. 

9561

WERE ATTENDED ALSO BY HIM.  

9574
04:59:40,595 --> 04:59:41,295
>> DID ANYTHING HAPPEN AT THESE 

9575
04:59:41,295 --> 04:59:41,529
EVENTS? 

9576
04:59:41,529 --> 04:59:42,096

05:03:12,574 --> 05:03:14,376
MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU HAVE 

9691
05:03:14,376 --> 05:03:16,544
CALLED FOR AN INDEPENDENT AND 

9692
05:03:16,544 --> 05:03:16,744

9693
05:03:16,744 --> 05:03:20,048

JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS NOT.  

9695
05:03:24,519 --> 05:03:24,952
WE OWE YOU THAT.  

9696
05:03:24,952 --> 05:03:26,821
WE OWE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT.

9697
05:03:26,821 --> 05:03:28,689
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS SO 

9698
05:03:28,689 --> 05:03:30,358
IMPORTANT.  

9699
05:03:30,358 --> 05:03:31,459
CONTRARY TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID 

9700
05:03:31,459 --> 05:03:33,762
TODAY, THE FBI DOES NOT REACH 

9701
05:03:33,762 --> 05:03:36,364
CONCLUSIONS.  THE FBI 

9702
05:03:36,364 --> 05:03:41,503
INVESTIGATES.  IT INTERVIEWS 

9703
05:03:41,503 --> 05:03:42,404
WITNESSES, GATHERS FACTS, AND 

9704
05:03:42,404 --> 05:03:45,573
PRESENT THAT INFORMATION TO THE 

9705
05:03:45,573 --> 05:03:46,173
UNITED STATES SENATE FOR OUR 

9706
05:03:46,173 --> 05:03:46,807

05:03:46,807 --> 05:03:48,543
COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT IN SPITE 

9708
05:03:48,543 --> 05:03:51,880
OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD.  

9709
05:03:51,880 --> 05:03:55,016
IN 1991 DURING A SIMILAR HEARING

9710
05:03:55,016 --> 05:03:56,884
ONE OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES 

9711
05:03:56,884 --> 05:03:59,554
IN THIS COMMITTEE STATED THESE 

9712
05:03:59,554 --> 05:04:01,723
CLAIMS WERE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY 

9713
05:04:01,723 --> 05:04:02,957
HAVING THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF 

9714
05:04:02,957 --> 05:04:05,293

9715
05:04:05,293 --> 05:04:08,997
INQUIRY TO DETERMINE THEIR 

9716
05:04:08,997 --> 05:04:09,297
VALIDITY.  

9717
05:04:09,297 --> 05:04:09,931
THE FBI FULFILLED ITS DUTY AND 

9718
05:04:09,931 --> 05:04:12,267
ISSUED A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT.  

9719
05:04:12,267 --> 05:04:13,368
THAT COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE 

9720
05:04:13,368 --> 05:04:17,806
BEEN DONE HERE.  

9721
05:04:17,806 --> 05:04:18,406
THIS MORNING IT WAS SAID THAT 

9722
05:04:18,406 --> 05:04:19,240
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN 

9723
05:04:19,240 --> 05:04:21,710
INVESTIGATED CONFIDENTIALLY 

9724
05:04:21,710 --> 05:04:22,110
BACK IN JULY.  

9725
05:04:22,110 --> 05:04:23,111
THIS ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN 

9726
05:04:23,111 --> 05:04:27,382
INVESTIGATED IN THE LAST 11 DAYS

9727
05:04:27,382 --> 05:04:28,016
SINCE YOU CAME FORWARD FORGET, 

9728
05:04:28,016 --> 05:04:29,184
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED.  

9729
05:04:29,184 --> 05:04:31,019
THE FBI COULD HAVE INTERVIEWED 

9730
05:04:31,019 --> 05:04:33,655

05:04:33,655 --> 05:04:37,325

05:04:40,195 --> 05:04:40,628
ON THESE ISSUES.  

9734
05:04:40,628 --> 05:04:44,165
THE FBI COULD HAVE EXAMINED 

9735
05:04:44,165 --> 05:04:44,765
VARIOUS MAPS THAT HAVE BEEN 

9736
05:04:44,765 --> 05:04:46,935
PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTOR WHO 

9737
05:04:46,935 --> 05:04:50,271
STANDS IN FOR THE UNITED STATES 

9738
05:04:50,271 --> 05:04:50,871
SENATORS ON THIS COMMITTEE.  

9739
05:04:50,871 --> 05:04:51,472
THE FBI COULD HAVE GATHERED 

9740
05:04:51,472 --> 05:04:52,072

9741
05:04:52,072 --> 05:04:52,606

9744
05:04:55,776 --> 05:04:58,913
THAT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE IN A 

9745
05:04:58,913 --> 05:04:59,413
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE.  

9746
05:04:59,413 --> 05:05:00,782

I DON'T EXPECT THAT PJ AND

9960
05:11:52,192 --> 05:11:52,793

9964
05:11:54,328 --> 05:11:56,897

AS A RESULT WE CANNOT TEST HIS

MEMORY OR MAKE ANY ASSESSMENT 

9969
05:12:04,238 --> 05:12:09,310
OF HIS THOUGHTFULNESS WERE CARE

9970
05:12:09,310 --> 05:12:10,144
.  I THINK THAT IS WHY THE 

9971
05:12:10,144 --> 05:12:10,778
FAILURE TO CALL HIM TO TESTIFY 

9972
05:12:10,778 --> 05:12:13,714
IS SO VERY CRITICAL.  I HOPE 

9973
05:12:13,714 --> 05:12:15,016
THE MAJORITY WOULD RECONSIDER 

9974
05:12:15,016 --> 05:12:18,753
THAT.  

9975
05:12:18,753 --> 05:12:19,253

THOSE STATEMENTS.  

9983
05:12:29,130 --> 05:12:30,030
I THINK THE NATURE OF THIS 

9984
05:12:30,030 --> 05:12:32,600
PROCEEDING WOULD BE COMPROMISED 

9985
05:12:32,600 --> 05:12:36,337

9986
05:12:36,337 --> 05:12:37,471

10083
05:15:25,039 --> 05:15:25,306
WELL.

O

10086
05:15:29,276 --> 05:15:32,179
HEARING ROOM.  RICKY, TO YOU 

10087
05:15:32,179 --> 05:15:32,813
FIRST WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE 

10088
05:15:32,813 --> 05:15:34,448
LAST HOUR AND A HALF AGO 

10089
05:15:34,448 --> 05:15:38,920
>> I THINK THAT THE LAST BIT OF 

10090
05:15:38,920 --> 05:15:42,289
EXAMINATION BY RACHEL MILLER, 

10091
05:15:42,289 --> 05:15:47,161
THE HIRED PROSECUTOR ON BEHALF 

10092
05:15:47,161 --> 05:15:55,602
OF THE REPUBLICANS WAS POWERFUL 

10093
05:15:55,602 --> 05:15:56,203
IN RAISING A POSSIBLE DOUBT 

10094
05:15:56,203 --> 05:15:56,937
ABOUT THE WITNESSES TESTIMONY.  

10095
05:15:56,937 --> 05:16:00,073
IF SHE HAD GOTTEN TO THAT A LOT 

10096
05:16:00,073 --> 05:16:01,308
SOONER SHE COULD HAVE DEVELOPED 

10097
05:16:01,308 --> 05:16:01,575
IT.  

10098
05:16:01,575 --> 05:16:03,277
WHAT SHE WAS REALLY TRYING TO 

10099
05:16:03,277 --> 05:16:07,014
SAY IS THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT 

10100
05:16:07,014 --> 05:16:09,784
MEMORY.  

10101
05:16:09,784 --> 05:16:10,418
IF YOU, PERHAPS, HAD GONE TO A 

10102
05:16:10,418 --> 05:16:13,888
FORENSIC EXAMINER AND DONE IT 

10103
05:16:13,888 --> 05:16:16,190
THE RIGHT WAY THAT PERHAPS YOU 

10104
05:16:16,190 --> 05:16:17,291
WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IT 

10105
05:16:17,291 --> 05:16:19,026
CORRECTLY AND A PERSON WOULD 

10106
05:16:19,026 --> 05:16:22,163
NOT HAVE BEEN BRETT KAVANAUGH.  

10107
05:16:22,163 --> 05:16:23,063
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WAY TOO 

10108
05:16:23,063 --> 05:16:26,667
LITTLE WAY TOO LATE. 

10109
05:16:26,667 --> 05:16:27,267
>>  IN OTHER WORDS, SHE WAS 

10110
05:16:27,267 --> 05:16:30,037
SAYING THAT IF A PROPER FORENSIC

10111
05:16:30,037 --> 05:16:31,305
, THE WAY SHE PREFERS TO DO IT, 

10112
05:16:31,305 --> 05:16:33,273
RACHEL MITCHELL, AFTER A TRAUMA,

10113
05:16:33,273 --> 05:16:34,608
IF IT WAS DONE THAT WAY AS 

10114
05:16:34,608 --> 05:16:46,620
OPPOSED TO THE POLYGRAPH TEST 

10115
05:16:46,620 --> 05:16:47,153
POSSIBLY SHE COULD HAVE 

10116
05:16:47,153 --> 05:16:47,654
REMEMBERED EVEN MORE. 

10117
05:16:47,654 --> 05:16:48,288
>>  SHE COULD HAVE REMEMBERED 

10118
05:16:48,288 --> 05:16:48,622
EVEN MORE.  

10119
05:16:48,622 --> 05:16:49,122
PERHAPS SHE COULD HAVE 

10120
05:16:49,122 --> 05:16:49,723
REMEMBERED IT DIFFERENTLY.  

10121
05:16:49,723 --> 05:16:50,390
THE ONE THING IT DOES NOT SHAKE 

10122
05:16:50,390 --> 05:16:51,091
HIS THIS, YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO 

10123
05:16:51,091 --> 05:16:51,725
SAYS THAT SHE IS 100% SURE IT 

10124
05:16:51,725 --> 05:16:52,259
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH.  

10125
05:16:52,259 --> 05:16:53,394
SHE KNEW BRETT KAVANAUGH.  

10126
05:16:53,394 --> 05:16:56,297
IT IS NOT LIKE SHE PICKED A 

10127
05:16:56,297 --> 05:16:58,799
STRANGER OUT OF A LINEUP OF 

10128
05:16:58,799 --> 05:17:09,310
SOMEONE SHE HAD NEVER MET.  

10129
05:17:09,310 --> 05:17:09,944
IT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO 

10130
05:17:09,944 --> 05:17:10,511
BE IN THE POSITION OF THE 

10131
05:17:10,511 --> 05:17:11,145
PROSECUTOR TO TRY TO UNDERMINE 

10132
05:17:11,145 --> 05:17:11,545
THE CREDIBILITY.  

10133
05:17:11,545 --> 05:17:13,914
YOU ARE BACK TO WHERE JAN WAS, 

10134
05:17:13,914 --> 05:17:15,683
WHICH WAS REALLY, IF YOU'RE NOT 

10135
05:17:15,683 --> 05:17:16,783
UNDERMINING CREDIBILITY AND 

10136
05:17:16,783 --> 05:17:21,221
SHOWING THAT SHE IS LYING OR 

10137
05:17:21,221 --> 05:17:21,855
MISTAKEN, I THINK LYING IS WAY 

10138
05:17:21,855 --> 05:17:24,158
OFF THE TABLE, SHE'S NOT LYING, 

10139
05:17:24,158 --> 05:17:27,695
THAT SHE IS MISTAKEN, THAT 

10140
05:17:27,695 --> 05:17:28,295
REALLY DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 

10141
05:17:28,295 --> 05:17:29,195
GOAL, WHICH IS THE POLITICAL 

10142
05:17:29,195 --> 05:17:33,701
GOAL THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE 

10143
05:17:33,701 --> 05:17:34,301
TIMING THAT MAY BE SOMETHING 

10144
05:17:34,301 --> 05:17:34,902
THAT WOULD BE USED BY THE 

10145
05:17:34,902 --> 05:17:36,737
POLITICIANS AFTER THIS? 

10146
05:17:36,737 --> 05:17:37,471
>> HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED 

10147
05:17:37,471 --> 05:17:41,241
REMEMBER SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY 

10148
05:17:41,241 --> 05:17:41,809
IF YOU KNOW THE PERSON WHO 

10149
05:17:41,809 --> 05:17:42,176
ASSAULTED YOU? 

10150
05:17:42,176 --> 05:17:43,810
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAY.  

10151
05:17:43,810 --> 05:17:44,377
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT 

10152
05:17:44,377 --> 05:17:45,011
SHE'S GETTING AT. 

10153
05:17:45,011 --> 05:17:48,682
>>  WHAT SHE'S GETTING AT IS 

10154
05:17:48,682 --> 05:17:49,283
THAT SOMETIMES WE IMPRINTING 

10155
05:17:49,283 --> 05:17:49,817
MEMORY IN A WAY THAT WE 

10156
05:17:49,817 --> 05:17:51,685
REMEMBER THE MEMORY AND NOT THE 

10157
05:17:51,685 --> 05:18:00,194
FACT THAT THE PROBLEM IS SHE 

10158
05:18:00,194 --> 05:18:00,494
KNEW HIM.  

10159
05:18:00,494 --> 05:18:01,095
SO QUICKLY TO BOTH OF YOU, 

10160
05:18:01,095 --> 05:18:01,395
APOLOGIES.  

10161
05:18:01,395 --> 05:18:02,029
JOHN CORNYN IS SPEAKING RIGHT 

10162
05:18:02,029 --> 05:18:02,262
NOW.  

10163
05:18:02,262 --> 05:18:02,930
WE ARE HEARING FOR THE FIRST 

10164
05:18:02,930 --> 05:18:04,765
TIME FROM SOME OF THE SENATORS. 

10165
05:18:04,765 --> 05:18:05,833
>>  OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A TOUGH 

10166
05:18:05,833 --> 05:18:08,736
SETTING FOR ANY WITNESS.  I 

10167
05:18:08,736 --> 05:18:13,774
THOUGHT IT WENT AS WELL AS YOU 

10168
05:18:13,774 --> 05:18:14,241
COULD EXPECT . THE IS 

10169
05:18:14,241 --> 05:18:16,177
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE HEARD IS 

10170
05:18:16,177 --> 05:18:17,077
AN ARTICULATION OF WHAT WE 

10171
05:18:17,077 --> 05:18:21,549
ALREADY SAW IN HER -- 

10172
05:18:21,549 --> 05:18:22,116
>> SENATOR, YOU HANDLED THE 

10173
05:18:22,116 --> 05:18:24,084
VOTE COUNTS AROUND HERE.  BASED 

10174
05:18:24,084 --> 05:18:25,186
ON WHAT WAS SAID THIS MORNING 

10175
05:18:25,186 --> 05:18:29,523
BY HER DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE YET

10176
05:18:29,523 --> 05:18:30,190
OF WHETHER YOU HAVE WHAT YOU 

10177
05:18:30,190 --> 05:18:30,391
NEED? 

10178
05:18:30,391 --> 05:18:31,458
>> I THINK WE NEED TO HEAR FROM 

10179
05:18:31,458 --> 05:18:35,361
THE JUDGE, HIS REPUTATION IS ON 

10180
05:18:35,361 --> 05:18:36,062
THE LINE . HIS CAREER AS WELL.  

10181
05:18:36,062 --> 05:18:36,997
THIS NEEDS TO BE A FAIR PROCESS 

10182
05:18:36,997 --> 05:18:40,668
TO BOTH DOCTOR FORD AND JUDGE 

10183
05:18:40,668 --> 05:18:40,968
KAVANAUGH.  

10184
05:18:40,968 --> 05:18:44,905
EXPECTED ANY OF YOU -- EXPECTED 

10185
05:18:44,905 --> 05:18:45,572
YOU PERSONALLY FIND HER TO BE 

10186
05:18:45,572 --> 05:18:45,839
CREDIBLE? 

10187
05:18:45,839 --> 05:18:47,007
>> I FOUND NO REASON TO FIND 

10188
05:18:47,007 --> 05:18:50,411
HER NOT CREDIBLE.  

10189
05:18:50,411 --> 05:18:51,078
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GAPS IN HER 

10190
05:18:51,078 --> 05:18:52,279
STORY.  

10191
05:18:52,279 --> 05:18:55,015
OBVIOUSLY, WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE 

10192
05:18:55,015 --> 05:19:02,189
TRAUMATIZED.  

10193
05:19:02,189 --> 05:19:02,856
THEY HAVE THOSE SORT OF GAPS.  

10194
05:19:02,856 --> 05:19:03,490
AGAIN, I REGRET THAT SHE FINDS 

10195
05:19:03,490 --> 05:19:05,192
HERSELF IN HIS CIRCUS -LIKE 

10196
05:19:05,192 --> 05:19:09,496
SETTING.  

10197
05:19:09,496 --> 05:19:10,130
HER LETTER TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN 

10198
05:19:10,130 --> 05:19:10,663
WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS 

10199
05:19:10,663 --> 05:19:11,197
AGAINST HER KNOWLEDGE AND 

10200
05:19:11,197 --> 05:19:12,633
WITHOUT HER AUTHORIZATION.  SHE 

10201
05:19:12,633 --> 05:19:13,367
WAS NOT TOLD BY HER LAWYERS 

10202
05:19:13,367 --> 05:19:16,203
THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN 

10203
05:19:16,203 --> 05:19:23,277
INTERVIEWED IN A PRIVATE SETTING

10204
05:19:23,277 --> 05:19:23,944
BY INVESTIGATORS ON BOTH SIDES 

10205
05:19:23,944 --> 05:19:24,578
AND GET HER TESTIMONY THAT WAY. 

10206
05:19:24,578 --> 05:19:27,982
I THOUGHT SHE DID JUST FINE. 

10207
05:19:27,982 --> 05:19:29,116
>>  ARE YOU PLEASED WITH RACHEL 

10208
05:19:29,116 --> 05:19:36,924
MITCHELL'S -- 

10209
05:19:36,924 --> 05:19:37,591
>> I THINK SHE DID EXACTLY WHAT 

10210
05:19:37,591 --> 05:19:38,258
I HOPED SHE WOULD DO, THAT IS A 

10211
05:19:38,258 --> 05:19:38,892
DIGNIFIED AND PROFESSIONAL WAY 

10212
05:19:38,892 --> 05:19:39,426
TO ASK QUESTIONS TO GET 

10213
05:19:39,426 --> 05:19:39,760
INFORMATION.  

10214
05:19:39,760 --> 05:19:40,294
I WOULD SAY MOST OF THE 

10215
05:19:40,294 --> 05:19:41,295
COMMENTS MADE BY OUR FRIENDS 

10216
05:19:41,295 --> 05:19:43,631
ACROSS THE AISLE STRUCK ME AS 

10217
05:19:43,631 --> 05:19:46,133
MORE POLITICAL.  THEY DIDN'T 

10218
05:19:46,133 --> 05:19:54,207
REALLY ASK QUESTIONS SEEKING 

10219
05:19:54,207 --> 05:19:54,541
INFORMATION.  

10220
05:19:54,541 --> 05:19:55,175
WE ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING TO 

10221
05:19:55,175 --> 05:19:55,508
THE TRUTH.  

10222
05:19:55,508 --> 05:19:57,678
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS A HYPER 

10223
05:19:57,678 --> 05:19:58,211
POLITICIZED ENVIRONMENT.  

10224
05:19:58,211 --> 05:19:59,013
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 

10225
05:19:59,013 --> 05:20:01,215
>>  SENATOR GRAHAM, I WILL ASK 

10226
05:20:01,215 --> 05:20:04,752
YOU, SHE SEEMED TOWARD THE ENDS

10227
05:20:04,752 --> 05:20:05,853
, MS. MITCHELL, TO BE 

10228
05:20:05,853 --> 05:20:06,386
QUESTIONING THE POLITICAL 

10229
05:20:06,386 --> 05:20:09,323
MOTIVES OF DOCTOR FORD'S 

10230
05:20:09,323 --> 05:20:09,823
ATTORNEYS.  

10231
05:20:09,823 --> 05:20:10,757
BY RAISING QUESTIONS -- 

10232
05:20:10,757 --> 05:20:19,466
>> I'M REALLY UPSET THAT THEY 

10233
05:20:19,466 --> 05:20:20,133
KNEW ABOUT THIS IN AUGUST AND 

10234
05:20:20,133 --> 05:20:20,634
NEVER TOLD ANYBODY.  

10235
05:20:20,634 --> 05:20:21,268
I'M REALLY UPSET THAT DIANNE 

10236
05:20:21,268 --> 05:20:24,605
FEINSTEIN BELIEVED THIS WAS A 

10237
05:20:24,605 --> 05:20:25,539
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION AND THAT 

10238
05:20:25,539 --> 05:20:27,208
SHE WOULDN'T DO MISTER JUDGE 

10239
05:20:27,208 --> 05:20:28,375
KAVANAUGH THE SERVICE OF SAYING 

10240
05:20:28,375 --> 05:20:33,113
I HAVE GOT THIS FOR WHAT IS 

10241
05:20:33,113 --> 05:20:33,647
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY? 

10242
05:20:33,647 --> 05:20:34,281
TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMITTEE 

10243
05:20:34,281 --> 05:20:34,948
SO WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING NOT AS 

10244
05:20:34,948 --> 05:20:37,651
CLOSE TO THE MIDTERMS.  WHEN 

10245
05:20:37,651 --> 05:20:38,251
THEY SAY SHE WASN'T SURE WE 

10246
05:20:38,251 --> 05:20:41,154
WERE WILLING TO GO OUT THERE 

10247
05:20:41,154 --> 05:20:41,721
THAT IS A BUNCH OF BULL.  

10248
05:20:41,721 --> 05:20:43,057
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY TOLD MS. 

10249
05:20:43,057 --> 05:20:45,458
FORD, BUT WE WERE WILLING TO GO 

10250
05:20:45,458 --> 05:20:45,926
TO CALIFORNIA.  

10251
05:20:45,926 --> 05:20:46,726
WE WERE TOLD SHE COULDN'T FLY.  

10252
05:20:46,726 --> 05:20:50,631
ALL I CAN SAY IS WE ARE 40 

10253
05:20:50,631 --> 05:20:52,066
SOMETHING DAYS AWAY FROM THE 

10254
05:20:52,066 --> 05:20:53,300
ELECTION AND THEIR GOAL, NOT 

10255
05:20:53,300 --> 05:21:00,074
MS. FORD SCHOOL, IS TO LAY THIS 

10256
05:21:00,074 --> 05:21:00,741
PAST THE MIDTERMS SO THEY CAN 

10257
05:21:00,741 --> 05:21:01,275
WIN THE SENATE AND NEVER 

10258
05:21:01,275 --> 05:21:01,942
ALLOWED TRUMP TO FILL THE SEAT. 

10259
05:21:01,942 --> 05:21:03,844
I BELIEVE THAT MET -- NOW MORE 

10260
05:21:03,844 --> 05:21:04,177
THAN EVER.  

10261
05:21:04,177 --> 05:21:04,811
I DON'T KNOW WHO PAID FOR HER 

10262
05:21:04,811 --> 05:21:06,914
POLYGRAPH BUT SOMEBODY DID.  

10263
05:21:06,914 --> 05:21:07,881
THE FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE 

10264
05:21:07,881 --> 05:21:11,285
SET IT UP TO BE JUST THE WAY IT 

10265
05:21:11,285 --> 05:21:11,618
IS.  

10266
05:21:11,618 --> 05:21:14,588
I FEEL AMBUSHED AS THE MAJORITY

10267
05:21:14,588 --> 05:21:16,924
.  WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM 

10268
05:21:16,924 --> 05:21:19,059
ESTHER KAVANAUGH, JUDGE 

10269
05:21:19,059 --> 05:21:21,595
KAVANAUGH, AND I HAVE BEEN A 

10270
05:21:21,595 --> 05:21:22,629
JUDGE, A PROSECUTOR, AND A 

10271
05:21:22,629 --> 05:21:23,063
DEFENSE ATTORNEY.  

10272
05:21:23,063 --> 05:21:23,997
WHEN IT COMES TO WHERE IT 

10273
05:21:23,997 --> 05:21:29,636
HAPPENED I STILL DON'T KNOW I 

10274
05:21:29,636 --> 05:21:30,304
DON'T KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENED.  

10275
05:21:30,304 --> 05:21:32,506
SHE SAID SHE IS 100% CERTAIN IT 

10276
05:21:32,506 --> 05:21:32,939
DID HAPPEN.  

10277
05:21:32,939 --> 05:21:33,573
I WOULD BET YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

10278
05:21:33,573 --> 05:21:34,975
WILL SAY I'M 100% SURE I DIDN'T 

10279
05:21:34,975 --> 05:21:41,881
DO IT.  THE PEOPLE NAMED SAY 

10280
05:21:41,881 --> 05:21:42,549
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT MS. FORD 

10281
05:21:42,549 --> 05:21:43,016
IS TALKING ABOUT.  

10282
05:21:43,016 --> 05:21:43,650
SHE CAN'T TELL US HOW SHE GOT 

10283
05:21:43,650 --> 05:21:44,250
HOME OR HOW SHE GOT THERE.  

10284
05:21:44,250 --> 05:21:44,851
THOSE ARE THE FACTS I'M LEFT 

10285
05:21:44,851 --> 05:21:45,085
WITH.  

10286
05:21:45,085 --> 05:21:47,087
A NICE LADY WHO HAS COME 

10287
05:21:47,087 --> 05:21:48,321
FORWARD TO TELL A HARD STORY 

10288
05:21:48,321 --> 05:21:50,791
THAT IS UNCORROBORATED.  

10289
05:21:50,791 --> 05:21:55,862
THIS IS ENOUGH, GOD HELP 

10290
05:21:55,862 --> 05:21:56,396
ANYBODY ELSE THAT GETS 

10291
05:21:56,396 --> 05:21:56,963
NOMINATED, BASED ON WHAT I 

10292
05:21:56,963 --> 05:21:57,597
HEARD TODAY YOU COULD NOT GET A 

10293
05:21:57,597 --> 05:21:58,264
SEARCH WARRANT OR AN ARREST 

10294
05:21:58,264 --> 05:22:00,434
WARRENT BECAUSE SHE DON'T KNOW 

10295
05:22:00,434 --> 05:22:01,035
THE LOCATION OR THE TIME AND 

10296
05:22:01,035 --> 05:22:03,871
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CORROBORATION

10297
05:22:03,871 --> 05:22:09,976
AS TO MS. MITCHELL -- MS. 

10298
05:22:09,976 --> 05:22:10,610
MITCHELL, THAT'S WHAT I HOPED 

10299
05:22:10,610 --> 05:22:10,977
SHE WOULD DO.  

10300
05:22:10,977 --> 05:22:11,545
I HEARD A BUNCH OF SPEECHES 

10301
05:22:11,545 --> 05:22:12,379
FROM A BUNCH OF POLITICIANS WHO 

10302
05:22:12,379 --> 05:22:16,149
HAVE POLITICIZED THIS FROM DAY 

10303
05:22:16,149 --> 05:22:16,517
ONE.  

10304
05:22:16,517 --> 05:22:17,151
WHO HAVE BEEN LYING IN WAIT FOR 

10305
05:22:17,151 --> 05:22:17,651
A POLITICAL PURPOSE.  

10306
05:22:17,651 --> 05:22:18,252
NOT MS. FORD, BUT, CERTAINLY 

10307
05:22:18,252 --> 05:22:18,786
THEM, MAKING A BUNCH OF 

10308
05:22:18,786 --> 05:22:20,521
SPEECHES . THE IS MITCHELL 

10309
05:22:20,521 --> 05:22:21,989
METHODICALLY WENT TO THE FACTS 

10310
05:22:21,989 --> 05:22:25,359
OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY, 

10311
05:22:25,359 --> 05:22:26,026
LEADING UP TO THAT DAY, AND HOW 

10312
05:22:26,026 --> 05:22:26,927
WE FIND OURSELVES HERE.  

10313
05:22:26,927 --> 05:22:28,862
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I'M 

10314
05:22:28,862 --> 05:22:30,230
PLEASED WITH WHAT I SAW. 

10315
05:22:30,230 --> 05:22:31,765
>>  DO YOU STILL WANT TO VOTE 

10316
05:22:31,765 --> 05:22:32,132
ON FRIDAY? 

10317
05:22:32,132 --> 05:22:36,036
>> WITH YOUR OWN BACKGROUND AS 

10318
05:22:36,036 --> 05:22:37,704
A PROSECUTOR, DEFENSE ATTORNEY, 

10319
05:22:37,704 --> 05:22:38,338
AND JUDGE DID YOU FIND DOCTOR 

10320
05:22:38,338 --> 05:22:40,407
FOR TO BE CREDIBLE -- CREDIBLE? 

10321
05:22:40,407 --> 05:22:45,045
>> I DID NOT FIND HER 

10322
05:22:45,045 --> 05:22:45,712
ALLEGATIONS TO BE CORROBORATED 

10323
05:22:45,712 --> 05:22:46,346
AGAINST MISTER KAVANAUGH.  

10324
05:22:46,346 --> 05:22:48,549
SHE IS SAYING IT IS BRETT 

10325
05:22:48,549 --> 05:22:49,216
KAVANAUGH BUT SHE CAN'T TELL ME 

10326
05:22:49,216 --> 05:22:56,623
THE HOUSE, CITY, THE MONTH OF 

10327
05:22:56,623 --> 05:22:56,923
THE YEAR.  

10328
05:22:56,923 --> 05:22:57,590
HE IS SAYING I DIDN'T DO IT.  

10329
05:22:57,590 --> 05:22:58,191
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU 

10330
05:22:58,191 --> 05:22:58,792
HAVE AN EMOTIONAL ACCUSATION 

10331
05:22:58,792 --> 05:22:59,392
AND AN EMOTIONAL DENIAL, USE 

10332
05:22:59,392 --> 05:23:05,199
THE RULE OF LAW, THE 

10333
05:23:05,199 --> 05:23:05,732
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 

10334
05:23:05,732 --> 05:23:06,366
ATTACHES TO THE PERSON ACCUSED. 

10335
05:23:06,366 --> 05:23:09,303
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM NOTICE AND

10336
05:23:09,303 --> 05:23:09,770
TIME AND LOCATION.  

10337
05:23:09,770 --> 05:23:10,904
YOU ASK IS THERE ANYBODY TO 

10338
05:23:10,904 --> 05:23:11,638
VERIFY THIS? 

10339
05:23:11,638 --> 05:23:12,305
WHEN YOU GIVE NAMES ALL OF THEM 

10340
05:23:12,305 --> 05:23:13,607
GO THE OTHER WAY.  

10341
05:23:13,607 --> 05:23:17,244
HAVING SAID THAT, WHAT DO I 

10342
05:23:17,244 --> 05:23:19,012
THINK ABOUT MS. FORD? 

10343
05:23:19,012 --> 05:23:23,750
VERY COMPETENT ACCOMPLISHED 

10344
05:23:23,750 --> 05:23:23,984
LADY.  

10345
05:23:23,984 --> 05:23:24,451
SOMETHING HAPPENED.  

10346
05:23:24,451 --> 05:23:24,918
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.  

10347
05:23:24,918 --> 05:23:25,786
YOU ARE ASKING ME TO SAVE IT 

10348
05:23:25,786 --> 05:23:27,554
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH AND I DON'T 

10349
05:23:27,554 --> 05:23:29,856
KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENED, WHERE IT 

10350
05:23:29,856 --> 05:23:31,124
HAPPENED, HE SAID IT DIDN'T 

10351
05:23:31,124 --> 05:23:34,761
HAPPEN.  

10352
05:23:34,761 --> 05:23:35,428
I WOULD SAY THIS BUT I THINK IT 

10353
05:23:35,428 --> 05:23:36,062
WAS A GOOD SUGGESTION FOR HER 

10354
05:23:36,062 --> 05:23:36,729
TO GO TALK TO SOMEBODY TO WORK 

10355
05:23:36,729 --> 05:23:37,264
THROUGH THIS.  

10356
05:23:37,264 --> 05:23:41,068
>> HOW IS THAT NOT ALL AN 

10357
05:23:41,068 --> 05:23:43,670
ARGUMENT FOR A AND MORE FULSOME 

10358
05:23:43,670 --> 05:23:44,204
INVESTIGATION? 

10359
05:23:44,204 --> 05:23:47,007
>> IF YOU REALLY BELIEVED WE 

10360
05:23:47,007 --> 05:23:47,774
NEEDED AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS 

10361
05:23:47,774 --> 05:23:49,109
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US IN 

10362
05:23:49,109 --> 05:23:49,342
AUGUST? 

10363
05:23:49,342 --> 05:23:50,944
LISTEN.  

10364
05:23:50,944 --> 05:23:53,313
THE FBI IS GOING TO TELL US 

10365
05:23:53,313 --> 05:23:54,848
WHAT.  

10366
05:23:54,848 --> 05:23:56,817
WHAT HOUSE ARE THEY GOING TO GO 

10367
05:23:56,817 --> 05:23:57,117
TO? 

10368
05:23:57,117 --> 05:23:58,451
WHAT CITY ARE THEY GOING TO GO 

10369
05:23:58,451 --> 05:24:00,254
TO? 

10370
05:24:00,254 --> 05:24:00,921
WHO ARE THEY GOING TO TALK TO? 

10371
05:24:00,921 --> 05:24:03,223
THEY CAN'T TELL US THE MONTH 

10372
05:24:03,223 --> 05:24:03,756
MIGHT BARELY THE YEAR.  

10373
05:24:03,756 --> 05:24:11,031
THIS IS ALL DELAY.  

10374
05:24:11,031 --> 05:24:19,873
>> DID MISTER JUDGE TELL YOU 

10375
05:24:19,873 --> 05:24:20,073
THAT? 

10376
05:24:20,073 --> 05:24:20,507
>> MISTER JUDGE.  

10377
05:24:20,507 --> 05:24:21,208
THEY SAY I DIDN'T DO IT I DON'T 

10378
05:24:21,208 --> 05:24:21,875
KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.  

10379
05:24:21,875 --> 05:24:22,609
THEY WANT TO CALL 25 PEOPLE WHO 

10380
05:24:22,609 --> 05:24:23,076
SAY HE'S AN ABUSER.  

10381
05:24:23,076 --> 05:24:23,744
WE WILL BE PAST THE MIDTERM.  

10382
05:24:23,744 --> 05:24:24,378
I'M NOT GOING TO REWARD PEOPLE 

10383
05:24:24,378 --> 05:24:25,011
FOR PLAYING A POLITICAL GAME.  

10384
05:24:25,011 --> 05:24:25,612
I THINK WITH HER LIFE SHE IS 

10385
05:24:25,612 --> 05:24:26,680
JUST AS MUCH A VICTIM IN THIS 

10386
05:24:26,680 --> 05:24:28,515
AS I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH IS.  

10387
05:24:28,515 --> 05:24:31,285
SOMEBODY BETRAYED HER TRUST.  

10388
05:24:31,285 --> 05:24:34,988
WE KNOW WHO SHE GET THE LETTER 

10389
05:24:34,988 --> 05:24:38,492
TO THE PEOPLE THAT BETRAYED HER 

10390
05:24:38,492 --> 05:24:39,025
TRUST OVER AN APOLOGY. 

10391
05:24:39,025 --> 05:24:40,127
>>  DO YOU STILL WANT TO VOTE 

10392
05:24:40,127 --> 05:24:50,037
ON FRIDAY? 

10393
05:24:50,037 --> 05:24:50,671
>> JEFF, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU 

10394
05:24:50,671 --> 05:24:51,305
HEAR ME, BUT, OBVIOUSLY, IT 

10395
05:24:51,305 --> 05:24:51,905
JUST UP SENATOR GRAHAM THERE 

10396
05:24:51,905 --> 05:24:53,340
WHO CLEARLY IS UPSET ABOUT WHAT 

10397
05:24:53,340 --> 05:24:55,542
TRANSPIRED AND BELIEVES THERE 

10398
05:24:55,542 --> 05:24:56,143
IS HOLES IN HER ARGUMENT.  

10399
05:24:56,143 --> 05:24:56,743
HE'S NOT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN 

10400
05:24:56,743 --> 05:24:57,144
THAT SAID THAT.  

10401
05:24:57,144 --> 05:24:57,778
I SPOKE WITH ANOTHER COMMITTEE 

10402
05:24:57,778 --> 05:24:59,346
MEMBER EARLIER WHO SAID 

10403
05:24:59,346 --> 05:25:01,648
PRIVATELY THAT THEY ARE 

10404
05:25:01,648 --> 05:25:06,019
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WHOLE 

10405
05:25:06,019 --> 05:25:06,619
ABOUT HOW IT IS SHE DOESN'T 

10406
05:25:06,619 --> 05:25:07,253
REMEMBER OR DOESN'T KNOW HOW 

10407
05:25:07,253 --> 05:25:08,789
SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT.  HOW 

10408
05:25:08,789 --> 05:25:12,693
IS IT THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO FLY

10409
05:25:12,693 --> 05:25:13,293
BUT SOMEHOW ENDS UP HERE IN 

10410
05:25:13,293 --> 05:25:13,594
WASHINGTON? 

10411
05:25:13,594 --> 05:25:14,695
HURTS HE WON'T TELL US HOW SHE 

10412
05:25:14,695 --> 05:25:17,264
GOT HERE.  SHE POINTS OUT 

10413
05:25:17,264 --> 05:25:17,864
DURING HER TESTIMONY SHE HAD 

10414
05:25:17,864 --> 05:25:18,832
FLOWN A FEW TIMES TO THE EAST 

10415
05:25:18,832 --> 05:25:20,333
COAST.  THERE ARE HOLES IN HER 

10416
05:25:20,333 --> 05:25:21,068
ARGUMENT.  

10417
05:25:21,068 --> 05:25:22,369
REPUBLICANS AGREE SHE CAME 

10418
05:25:22,369 --> 05:25:23,937
ACROSS AS LIKABLE AND CREDIBLE 

10419
05:25:23,937 --> 05:25:26,673
AND THEY EXPECT THE JUDGE TO 

10420
05:25:26,673 --> 05:25:29,343
HOPEFULLY DO THAT AS WELL THIS 

10421
05:25:29,343 --> 05:25:32,446
AFTERNOON.  

10422
05:25:32,446 --> 05:25:33,013
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  

10423
05:25:33,013 --> 05:25:33,647
GREAT JOB WITH THOSE QUESTIONS 

10424
05:25:33,647 --> 05:25:34,281
AND THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING TO 

10425
05:25:34,281 --> 05:25:34,648
BOTH OF THEM.  

10426
05:25:34,648 --> 05:25:36,349
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WITH THE 

10427
05:25:36,349 --> 05:25:37,650
SECOND AND BY FAR THE STRONGEST 

10428
05:25:37,650 --> 05:25:42,022
REACTION SO FAR TO WHAT WE SAW 

10429
05:25:42,022 --> 05:25:42,622
THIS MORNING AND EARLY THIS 

10430
05:25:42,622 --> 05:25:42,956
AFTERNOON.  

10431
05:25:42,956 --> 05:25:45,158
SENATOR GRAHAM SAYING I FEEL 

10432
05:25:45,158 --> 05:25:50,364
AMBUSHED.  GOING AFTER NOT 

10433
05:25:50,364 --> 05:25:50,998
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, BUT THE 

10434
05:25:50,998 --> 05:25:53,700
DEMOCRATS AND ASSAYING THIS WAS 

10435
05:25:53,700 --> 05:25:54,367
CRITICALLY MOTIVATED IN THE WAY 

10436
05:25:54,367 --> 05:25:55,736
IT WAS ORCHESTRATED, THE TIMING

10437
05:25:55,736 --> 05:25:58,605
, ALL MEANT TO DELAY THE PROCESS

10438
05:25:58,605 --> 05:26:01,708
.  SO IT WOULD BE PUSHED PAST 

10439
05:26:01,708 --> 05:26:02,408
THE MIDTERMS OR EVEN FAR BEYOND 

10440
05:26:02,408 --> 05:26:02,943
THAT.  

10441
05:26:02,943 --> 05:26:05,478
SOME WIRY LANGUAGE THEREFROM 

10442
05:26:05,478 --> 05:26:07,948
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM.  HE DID 

10443
05:26:07,948 --> 05:26:08,982
NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION OF 

10444
05:26:08,982 --> 05:26:09,883
WHETHER HE IS STILL STILL 

10445
05:26:09,883 --> 05:26:13,387
CALLING FOR A VOTE TOMORROW, 

10446
05:26:13,387 --> 05:26:13,987
WHICH WOULD THEN POTENTIALLY 

10447
05:26:13,987 --> 05:26:16,490
LEAD TO A FINAL VOTE AND 

10448
05:26:16,490 --> 05:26:17,190
POTENTIALLY CONFIRMATION OF 

10449
05:26:17,190 --> 05:26:19,092
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH EARLY 

10450
05:26:19,092 --> 05:26:22,329
NEXT WEEK.  IF THAT WERE TO 

10451
05:26:22,329 --> 05:26:22,596
HAPPEN.  

10452
05:26:22,596 --> 05:26:25,332
WE HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM JUDGE 

10453
05:26:25,332 --> 05:26:25,665
KAVANAUGH.  

10454
05:26:25,665 --> 05:26:26,900
THAT WILL TAKE PLACE THIS 

10455
05:26:26,900 --> 05:26:29,002
AFTERNOON AFTER CHRISTINE 

10456
05:26:29,002 --> 05:26:32,139
BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY JUST 

10457
05:26:32,139 --> 05:26:32,472
WRAPPED UP.  

10458
05:26:32,472 --> 05:26:35,809
WE DEALT WITH THREE SESSIONS 

10459
05:26:35,809 --> 05:26:36,443
WHERE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ALL 

10460
05:26:36,443 --> 05:26:38,645
HAD A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS 

10461
05:26:38,645 --> 05:26:39,145
AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY 

10462
05:26:39,145 --> 05:26:41,248
REPUBLICAN DEFERRED TO THE 

10463
05:26:41,248 --> 05:26:42,282
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR RACHEL 

10464
05:26:42,282 --> 05:26:45,886
MITCHELL WHO TOOK CHRISTINE 

10465
05:26:45,886 --> 05:26:46,687
BLASEY FORD THROUGH A TIMELINE 

10466
05:26:46,687 --> 05:26:49,056
OF WHAT SHE SAYS HAPPENED BACK 

10467
05:26:49,056 --> 05:26:52,092
IN THE EARLY 80s.  SHE ALSO 

10468
05:26:52,092 --> 05:26:53,293
QUESTION WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE 

10469
05:26:53,293 --> 05:26:55,262
IN JUST THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  

10470
05:26:55,262 --> 05:26:58,565
NWORA IS ON CAPITOL HILL AND 

10471
05:26:58,565 --> 05:26:59,132
HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS ALL 

10472
05:26:59,132 --> 05:27:00,801
MORNING AND AFTERNOON.  

10473
05:27:00,801 --> 05:27:03,904
NWORA, DO WE HAVE DICK DURBIN 

10474
05:27:03,904 --> 05:27:04,204
RIGHT NOW? 

10475
05:27:04,204 --> 05:27:05,338
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT. 

10476
05:27:05,338 --> 05:27:07,807
>>  TERRIFIED.  

10477
05:27:07,807 --> 05:27:08,508
I THOUGHT SHE HANDLED THE 

10478
05:27:08,508 --> 05:27:11,011
QUESTIONS PROFESSIONALLY AND 

10479
05:27:11,011 --> 05:27:12,179
HONESTLY.  VOLUNTEERED ANSWERS 

10480
05:27:12,179 --> 05:27:14,681
WHEN SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO I 

10481
05:27:14,681 --> 05:27:17,250
THOUGHT SHE MADE A VERY 

10482
05:27:17,250 --> 05:27:19,219
CREDIBLE PRESENTATION. 

10483
05:27:19,219 --> 05:27:19,853
>>  DO YOU THINK IT BACKFIRED 

10484
05:27:19,853 --> 05:27:22,956
ON THE REPUBLICANS TO HAVE AN 

10485
05:27:22,956 --> 05:27:27,961
OUTSIDE COUNSEL QUESTIONING? 

10486
05:27:27,961 --> 05:27:29,062
>> WELL, IF YOU LISTEN TO THE 

10487
05:27:29,062 --> 05:27:36,369
PROSECUTOR'S CONCLUSION DOING 

10488
05:27:36,369 --> 05:27:36,969
AN INTERIEW IN FIVE MINUTE 

10489
05:27:36,969 --> 05:27:37,603
SEGMENTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  

10490
05:27:37,603 --> 05:27:38,338
YOU CAN TELL THAT SHE WAS 

10491
05:27:38,338 --> 05:27:38,672
FRUSTRATED.  

10492
05:27:38,672 --> 05:27:41,374
I COULDN'T FOLLOW HER LINE OF 

10493
05:27:41,374 --> 05:27:41,907
THINKING.  I TRIED TO 

10494
05:27:41,907 --> 05:27:43,009
UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE WAS COMING 

10495
05:27:43,009 --> 05:27:44,144
FROM.  

10496
05:27:44,144 --> 05:27:46,947
IT SEEMED SO OBLIQUE AND SO 

10497
05:27:46,947 --> 05:27:50,016
FRAGMENTED.  

10498
05:27:50,016 --> 05:27:50,650
I NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD WHAT 

10499
05:27:50,650 --> 05:27:54,788
SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY.  

10500
05:27:54,788 --> 05:28:03,964
>>[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

10501
05:28:03,964 --> 05:28:04,598
>> THE THING WE NEED TO HEAR 

10502
05:28:04,598 --> 05:28:05,232
THE MOST IS WHAT IS OBVIOUS.  

10503
05:28:05,232 --> 05:28:05,832
IF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AND 

10504
05:28:05,832 --> 05:28:06,499
THERE ARE NO WITNESSES TO BACK 

10505
05:28:06,499 --> 05:28:07,167
UP WHAT SHE JUST TOLD US UNDER 

10506
05:28:07,167 --> 05:28:09,770
OATH WHY AREN'T YOU SUPPORTING 

10507
05:28:09,770 --> 05:28:13,039
AN INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI? 

10508
05:28:13,039 --> 05:28:15,074
WHAT YOU WANT TO CLEAR YOUR NAME

10509
05:28:15,074 --> 05:28:23,082
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE COURTS 

10510

YOUR NAME AND MAKE SURE THAT 

10512
05:28:24,317 --> 05:28:25,218
THE COURTS HAVE NO SHADOW OF 

10513
05:28:25,218 --> 05:28:32,859
SUSPICION? 

10514
05:28:32,859 --> 05:28:33,459
>> DICK DURBIN'S REACTION TO 

10515
05:28:33,459 --> 05:28:33,993
WHAT HE HAS HEARD TODAY.  

10516
05:28:33,993 --> 05:28:49,276
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS, THE 

10517
05:28:49,276 --> 05:28:49,843
PROSECUTOR RACHEL MITCHELL 

10518
05:28:49,843 --> 05:28:50,477
ABOUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO 

10519
05:28:50,477 --> 05:28:51,178
HEAR THE END IS RACHEL MITCHELL 

10520
05:28:51,178 --> 05:28:51,845
AT THE END OF HER QUESTIONING, 

10521
05:28:51,845 --> 05:28:52,245
THE PROSECUTOR.  

10522
05:28:52,245 --> 05:28:52,879
BY REPUBLICANS WAS ESSENTIALLY 

10523
05:28:52,879 --> 05:28:53,513
UNDERCUTTING THE STRATEGY BEEN 

10524
05:28:53,513 --> 05:28:54,047
PICKED BY REPUBLICANS AND 

10525
05:28:54,047 --> 05:28:54,714
SAYING THERE IS NOT A LOT I CAN 

10526
05:28:54,714 --> 05:28:55,382
DO IN FIVE MINUTE SEGMENTS WHEN 

10527
05:28:55,382 --> 05:28:56,049
I AM THEN INTERRUPTED.  THERE'S 

10528
05:28:56,049 --> 05:28:58,050
NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PLACES TO GO

10529
05:28:58,050 --> 05:28:59,218
.  AS SHE FINISHED UP HER 

10530
05:28:59,218 --> 05:29:01,654
QUESTIONING OF CHRISTINE BLASEY 

10531
05:29:01,654 --> 05:29:02,221
FORD THIS MORNING.  

10532
05:29:02,221 --> 05:29:05,392
YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT A LOT AS 

10533
05:29:05,392 --> 05:29:09,429
WELL AND THE CHALLENGE THAT SHE 

10534
05:29:09,429 --> 05:29:10,029
FACED IN TRYING TO GET 

10535
05:29:10,029 --> 05:29:11,031
INFORMATION HERE. 

10536
05:29:11,031 --> 05:29:14,067
>>  I DON'T ENVY HER POSITION.  

10537
05:29:14,067 --> 05:29:16,803
SHE HAD TWO DUTIES.  

10538
05:29:16,803 --> 05:29:19,405
ONE WAS TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE 

10539
05:29:19,405 --> 05:29:21,340
CREDIBILITY OF DOCTOR FORD IN 

10540
05:29:21,340 --> 05:29:22,843
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WHETHER IT 

10541
05:29:22,843 --> 05:29:33,086
WAS TO HER MEMORY OR TWO, IN 

10542
05:29:33,086 --> 05:29:33,686
FACT, WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS 

10543
05:29:33,686 --> 05:29:34,320
TELLING THE TRUTH . THE SECOND 

10544
05:29:34,320 --> 05:29:34,887
ONE WAS TO CARRY OUT THE 

10545
05:29:34,887 --> 05:29:35,388
POLITICAL AGENDA OF THE 

10546
05:29:35,388 --> 05:29:36,590
REPUBLICANS WHO HIRED HER.  

10547
05:29:36,590 --> 05:29:38,692
WHICH, CLEARLY, SHE DID MUCH OF 

10548
05:29:38,692 --> 05:29:39,893
HER EXAMINATION DEALING WITH 

10549
05:29:39,893 --> 05:29:43,230
THE TIMING OF THE LETTERS, THE 

10550
05:29:43,230 --> 05:29:46,266
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 

10551
05:29:46,266 --> 05:29:47,033
REPRESENTATIVE, AND THEN WITH 

10552
05:29:47,033 --> 05:29:47,500
SENATOR FEINSTEIN.  

10553
05:29:47,500 --> 05:29:50,670
AND THEN HER GETTING A LAWYER 

10554
05:29:50,670 --> 05:29:51,237
AND THEN THE POLYGRAPH.  

10555
05:29:51,237 --> 05:29:52,906
WHAT SHE IS TRYING TO DO IS 

10556
05:29:52,906 --> 05:29:55,008
GIVE THE REPUBLICANS COVER FOR 

10557
05:29:55,008 --> 05:29:58,178
THOSE WHO WOULD REALLY LIKE TO 

10558
05:29:58,178 --> 05:29:59,312
SAY THIS IS ALL A DEMOCRATIC 

10559
05:29:59,312 --> 05:29:59,579
PROBLEM.  

10560
05:29:59,579 --> 05:30:01,982
DID SHE DO THAT? 

10561
05:30:01,982 --> 05:30:04,551
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR 

10562
05:30:04,551 --> 05:30:05,251
SENATOR DURBIN SAY I HAD A HARD 

10563
05:30:05,251 --> 05:30:06,319
TIME FOLLOWING HER LINE OF 

10564
05:30:06,319 --> 05:30:06,787
QUESTIONING. 

10565
05:30:06,787 --> 05:30:07,487
>>  RACHEL MITCHELL. 

10566
05:30:07,487 --> 05:30:08,088
>>  YEAH.  

10567
05:30:08,088 --> 05:30:14,694
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW 

10568
05:30:14,694 --> 05:30:15,328
RACHEL MITCHELL BECAUSE OF THE 

10569
05:30:15,328 --> 05:30:15,829
FIVE-MINUTE INTERVALS.  

10570
05:30:15,829 --> 05:30:16,429
WE SAW IT IN THE VERY FIRST 

10571
05:30:16,429 --> 05:30:17,096
SEGMENT WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO 

10572
05:30:17,096 --> 05:30:17,664
DO WITH THREE ISSUES THAT 

10573
05:30:17,664 --> 05:30:19,732
NEEDED EDITING IN A DOCUMENT OR 

10574
05:30:19,732 --> 05:30:22,869
CORRECTIONS IN DOCUMENT AND SHE 

10575
05:30:22,869 --> 05:30:23,503
COULDN'T EVEN GET TO THE THIRD 

10576
05:30:23,503 --> 05:30:23,703
ONE. 

10577
05:30:23,703 --> 05:30:31,678
>>  I THINK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

10578
05:30:31,678 --> 05:30:32,312
WATCHING WHAT SENATOR GRAHAM 

10579
05:30:32,312 --> 05:30:32,946
HAD TO SAY AND HIS REACTION I 

10580
05:30:32,946 --> 05:30:33,613
THINK IT IS A WAY OF THINKING 

10581
05:30:33,613 --> 05:30:34,247
ABOUT HOW SHE DID CONDUCT THESE 

10582
05:30:34,247 --> 05:30:34,547
QUESTIONS.  

10583
05:30:34,547 --> 05:30:38,685
SHE DID RAISE AND POINT TO SOME 

10584
05:30:38,685 --> 05:30:39,285
REAL HOLES IN THE TESTIMONY 

10585
05:30:39,285 --> 05:30:39,919
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.  

10586
05:30:39,919 --> 05:30:40,486
SHE RAISED INCONSISTENCIES 

10587
05:30:40,486 --> 05:30:41,020
ABOUT A SPECIFIC YEAR IT 

10588
05:30:41,020 --> 05:30:41,921
STARTED OUT BEING SOMETIME IN 

10589
05:30:41,921 --> 05:30:43,590
THE 80s AND THEN IT WAS THE 

10590
05:30:43,590 --> 05:30:44,491
EARLY 80s.  

10591
05:30:44,491 --> 05:30:49,029
AND THEN IT BECAME MAYBE 1982 

10592
05:30:49,029 --> 05:30:49,329
OR 1983.  

10593
05:30:49,329 --> 05:30:50,496
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT IS 1982. 

10594
05:30:50,496 --> 05:30:52,999
>> THEY SAY THAT IS COMMON WITH 

10595
05:30:52,999 --> 05:30:53,366
TRAUMA VICTIMS. 

10596
05:30:53,366 --> 05:31:03,609
>>  THIS DARTED OUT, STARTING 

10597
05:31:03,609 --> 05:31:04,210
OUT FROM HER TESTIMONY TODAY 

10598
05:31:04,210 --> 05:31:04,844
BUT THEN GOING BACK TO EVEN 

10599
05:31:04,844 --> 05:31:05,511
WHAT SHE TOLD WASHINGTON POST.  

10600
05:31:05,511 --> 05:31:06,112
THAT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.  

10601
05:31:06,112 --> 05:31:06,813
THEY WERE ABLE TO POINT TO SOME 

10602
05:31:06,813 --> 05:31:07,447
INCONSISTENCIES IN HER STORY 

10603
05:31:07,447 --> 05:31:15,856
THAT SHE HAS EVEN TOLD RECENTLY.

10604
05:31:15,856 --> 05:31:16,556
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE AT THE 

10605
05:31:16,556 --> 05:31:16,789
PARTY? 

10606
05:31:16,789 --> 05:31:17,390
THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED 

10607
05:31:17,390 --> 05:31:18,091
THIS AND THEN SHE SAID THIS TO 

10608
05:31:18,091 --> 05:31:18,691
THE THERAPIST AND IS NOW.  

10609
05:31:18,691 --> 05:31:22,929
AL OF THAT, ALL OF THOSE 

10610
05:31:22,929 --> 05:31:23,696
INCONSISTENCIES THAT MAY NOT 

10611
05:31:23,696 --> 05:31:24,397
ADD UP TO MUCH AND THERE IS NO 

10612
05:31:24,397 --> 05:31:24,998
REAL AHA MOMENT, BUT ALL OF 

10613
05:31:24,998 --> 05:31:27,968
THAT THEN ALLOWS WHAT WE SAW 

10614
05:31:27,968 --> 05:31:28,568
AND THE REACTION FROM WHAT 

10615
05:31:28,568 --> 05:31:29,135
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM 

10616
05:31:29,135 --> 05:31:29,936
REPUBLICANS, WHICH IS THE FACTS

10617
05:31:29,936 --> 05:31:30,971
.  AFTER THIS HEARING THERE IS 

10618
05:31:30,971 --> 05:31:35,508
STILL NO CORROBORATION.  

10619
05:31:35,508 --> 05:31:35,941
THERE IS STILL NO 

10620
05:31:35,941 --> 05:31:36,509
CONTEMPORANEOUS EVIDENCE.  

10621
05:31:36,509 --> 05:31:38,545
IT IS STILL CREDIBILITY AS 

10622
05:31:38,545 --> 05:31:41,381
NWORA HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT 

10623
05:31:41,381 --> 05:31:43,916
IS HE SAID, SHE SAID.  

10624
05:31:43,916 --> 05:31:44,417
THIS IS A QUESTION OF 

10625
05:31:44,417 --> 05:31:44,751
CREDIBILITY.  

10626
05:31:44,751 --> 05:31:46,920
PEOPLE BELIEVE SHE CAME ACROSS 

10627
05:31:46,920 --> 05:31:50,823
AS CREDIBLE BUT NOW IT'S ALL ON 

10628
05:31:50,823 --> 05:31:51,224
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

10629
05:31:51,224 --> 05:31:51,858
>>  SO THERE'S ROOM ON BOTH 

10630
05:31:51,858 --> 05:31:52,558
SIDES TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT 

10631
05:31:52,558 --> 05:31:53,226
WE SUPPORT THIS PERSON OR THIS 

10632
05:31:53,226 --> 05:31:53,793
PERSON THIS IS WHY WE ARE 

10633
05:31:53,793 --> 05:31:54,961
VOTING. 

10634
05:31:54,961 --> 05:31:57,063
>>  WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO 

10635
05:31:57,063 --> 05:31:57,697
MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION WHO 

10636
05:31:57,697 --> 05:31:58,364
ARE ON THE FENCE THEY HAVE TO 

10637
05:31:58,364 --> 05:31:59,165
DECIDE WAS DOCTOR FORD CREDIBLE 

10638
05:31:59,165 --> 05:32:03,370
ENOUGH NOT TO ELEVATE KAVANAUGH?

10639
05:32:03,370 --> 05:32:05,372
IT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER OR 

10640
05:32:05,372 --> 05:32:13,713
WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS 

10641
05:32:13,713 --> 05:32:14,013
CREDIBLE.  

10642
05:32:14,013 --> 05:32:14,647
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HER THAT WAS 

10643
05:32:14,647 --> 05:32:14,980
NOT CREDIBLE? 

10644
05:32:14,980 --> 05:32:15,648
THAT HAS TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST 

10645
05:32:15,648 --> 05:32:17,817
WHAT WAS WITNESSED TODAY, WHICH 

10646
05:32:17,817 --> 05:32:18,451
EVEN REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 

10647
05:32:18,451 --> 05:32:19,085
SAYING SHE SEEMED CREDIBLE.  

10648
05:32:19,085 --> 05:32:20,186
I WAS STRUCK THAT SENATOR 

10649
05:32:20,186 --> 05:32:22,555
CORNYN SAID THAT THE GAPS PROOF 

10650
05:32:22,555 --> 05:32:23,056
OF THE TRAUMA.  

10651
05:32:23,056 --> 05:32:28,728
IN OTHER WORDS, SAYING HE SAW 

10652
05:32:28,728 --> 05:32:29,396
SOME GAPS IN HER STORY BUT THEN 

10653
05:32:29,396 --> 05:32:30,030
HE QUICKLY SAID AFTER THAT IT 

10654
05:32:30,030 --> 05:32:32,365
IS PROOF OF THE TRAUMA, AS IF TO

10655
05:32:32,365 --> 05:32:34,868
, IT WASN'T HIS INTENT, BUT TO 

10656
05:32:34,868 --> 05:32:36,903
UNDERSCORE -- 

10657
05:32:36,903 --> 05:32:39,873
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE 

10658
05:32:39,873 --> 05:32:40,440
WATCHING THAT SANCTION WAS 

10659
05:32:40,440 --> 05:32:44,010
EVASIVE IN ANY WAY.  

10660
05:32:44,010 --> 05:32:44,644
SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS THAT 

10661
05:32:44,644 --> 05:32:44,977
WERE ASKED.  

10662
05:32:44,977 --> 05:32:46,079
AS WE MOVE TO THE AFTERNOON THE 

10663
05:32:46,079 --> 05:32:46,913
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING 

10664
05:32:46,913 --> 05:32:49,482
TO HEAR FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH? 

10665
05:32:49,482 --> 05:32:50,016
>> RIGHT.  

10666
05:32:50,016 --> 05:32:53,286
I THINK BECAUSE NOW WE REALLY 

10667
05:32:53,286 --> 05:32:55,054
HAVE NO NEW INFORMATION, NO NEW 

10668
05:32:55,054 --> 05:32:56,422
FACTS.  WE SAW SOME 

10669
05:32:56,422 --> 05:32:57,389
INCONSISTENCIES.  NOW THE 

10670
05:32:57,389 --> 05:33:00,259
PRESSURE IS ON KAVANAUGH TO 

10671
05:33:00,259 --> 05:33:01,293
COME ACROSS AS CREDIBLE AND 

10672
05:33:01,293 --> 05:33:04,063
BELIEVABLE AND ANSWER THESE 

10673
05:33:04,063 --> 05:33:04,931
QUESTIONS AS OPENLY AND 

10674
05:33:04,931 --> 05:33:07,033
HONESTLY AND FORTHRIGHTLY AS HE 

10675
05:33:07,033 --> 05:33:07,300
CAN.  

10676
05:33:07,300 --> 05:33:13,406
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HIM PRESENT

10677
05:33:13,406 --> 05:33:14,040
A DEFENSE THAT THIS WAS NOT ME. 

10678
05:33:14,040 --> 05:33:14,674
I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A 

10679
05:33:14,674 --> 05:33:15,207
PRETTY IMPASSIONED ONE.  

10680
05:33:15,207 --> 05:33:18,878
THIS IS NOT ABOUT JUST THE 

10681
05:33:18,878 --> 05:33:19,545
SUPREME COURT AND A SEAT ON THE 

10682
05:33:19,545 --> 05:33:20,313
SUPREME COURT FOR LIFE, THIS IS 

10683
05:33:20,313 --> 05:33:20,980
ABOUT HIS LIFE AND A REPUTATION 

10684
05:33:20,980 --> 05:33:23,649
THAT HE HAS BUILT.  YOU'RE 

10685
05:33:23,649 --> 05:33:24,784
GOING TO SEE HIM MAKE THAT 

10686
05:33:24,784 --> 05:33:26,052
OPENING STATEMENT.  

10687
05:33:26,052 --> 05:33:29,322
AND THEN IT'S THE QUESTIONS.  

10688
05:33:29,322 --> 05:33:37,930
>> OTHER INCONSISTENCIES AND 

10689
05:33:37,930 --> 05:33:38,464
NOT TO DOUBT HER STORY? 

10690
05:33:38,464 --> 05:33:39,031
>> WHAT WE WILL SEE FROM 

10691
05:33:39,031 --> 05:33:39,632
KAVANAUGH, YOU WILL SEE THE 

10692
05:33:39,632 --> 05:33:40,266
DEMOCRATS TRY TO IMPUGN THAT 

10693
05:33:40,266 --> 05:33:40,833
CHARACTER AND HIS NAME AND 

10694
05:33:40,833 --> 05:33:43,002
INTEGRITY THAT HE WAS A THIS IS 

10695
05:33:43,002 --> 05:33:43,602
AT ODDS WITH THE WAY I HAVE 

10696
05:33:43,602 --> 05:33:44,470
LIVED MY WHOLE LIFE.  

10697
05:33:44,470 --> 05:33:46,305
IT WILL BE HIS LIFE OPEN FOR 

10698
05:33:46,305 --> 05:33:49,743
EXAMINATION THIS AFTERNOON.  

10699
05:33:49,743 --> 05:33:51,010
>> NWORA IS STANDING BY. 

10700
05:33:51,010 --> 05:33:52,946
>>  HOW COMBATIVE DO YOU THINK 

10701
05:33:52,946 --> 05:33:53,779
IT WILL BE? 

10702
05:33:53,779 --> 05:33:55,748
>> I THINK IT COULD BE QUITE 

10703
05:33:55,748 --> 05:33:59,119
COMBATIVE.  

10704
05:33:59,119 --> 05:33:59,686
BASED ON THE TONE OF THE 

10705
05:33:59,686 --> 05:34:00,253
HEARING SO FAR AND THE WAY 

10706
05:34:00,253 --> 05:34:00,887
REPUBLICANS ARE INTERPRETING IT 

10707
05:34:00,887 --> 05:34:03,056
LIKE WE ARE TRYING TO BE FAIR, 

10708
05:34:03,056 --> 05:34:04,958
DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING POLITICS. 

10709
05:34:04,958 --> 05:34:06,626
IF DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO LOOK 

10710
05:34:06,626 --> 05:34:14,300
LIKE THEY ARE PLAYING -- THEY 

10711
05:34:14,300 --> 05:34:14,934
ARE PLAYING POLITICS THAT COULD 

10712
05:34:14,934 --> 05:34:15,568
HELP KAVANAUGH AND REPUBLICANS 

10713
05:34:15,568 --> 05:34:16,235
TRYING TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT FOR 

10714
05:34:16,235 --> 05:34:16,435
HIM. 

10715
05:34:16,435 --> 05:34:17,069
>>  YOU CAN'T IMAGINE DEMOCRATS 

10716
05:34:17,069 --> 05:34:17,703
WANT TO MAKE THEIR STORY AFTER 

10717
05:34:17,703 --> 05:34:18,370
THE TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR FORD 

10718
05:34:18,370 --> 05:34:27,180
WHO SEEMS THERE IS AGREEMENT 

10719
05:34:27,180 --> 05:34:27,814
SHE WAS A CREDIBLE WITNESS.  

10720
05:34:27,814 --> 05:34:28,448
IF THERE WERE PURELY POLITICAL 

10721
05:34:28,448 --> 05:34:29,115
MOTIVES THEY WOULD WANT HER TO 

10722
05:34:29,115 --> 05:34:29,682
BE THE FACE OF THIS, NOT 

10723
05:34:29,682 --> 05:34:30,016
THEMSELVES.  

10724
05:34:30,016 --> 05:34:30,717
HE MIGHT GET IN THEIR OWN WAY.  

10725
05:34:30,717 --> 05:34:33,653
HERE IS THE OTHER QUESTION.  

10726
05:34:33,653 --> 05:34:34,921
RACHEL MITCHELL HANDLED THE 

10727
05:34:34,921 --> 05:34:38,825
QUESTIONS FOR REPUBLICAN 

10728
05:34:38,825 --> 05:34:39,459
SENATORS FOR CHRISTINE BLASEY 

10729
05:34:39,459 --> 05:34:39,692
FORD.  

10730
05:34:39,692 --> 05:34:40,693
HOW DOES SHE THEN PLAY INTO THE 

10731
05:34:40,693 --> 05:34:42,929
KAVANAUGH QUESTIONS? 

10732
05:34:42,929 --> 05:34:50,036
>> THE KAVANAUGH -- KAVANAUGH 

10733
05:34:50,036 --> 05:34:50,904
GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS FOR ALL 

10734
05:34:50,904 --> 05:34:51,704
OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS.  

10735
05:34:51,704 --> 05:34:52,538
THERE IS A PART OF RACHEL 

10736
05:34:52,538 --> 05:34:58,311
MITCHELL THAT YOU COULD WATCH.  

10737
05:34:58,311 --> 05:34:58,945
WHEN SHE WOULD ATTEMPT TO BE 

10738
05:34:58,945 --> 05:35:00,313
FRIENDLY AND COMFORTING AND BE 

10739
05:35:00,313 --> 05:35:04,617
THERE WITH YOU AND ACT ALMOST 

10740
05:35:04,617 --> 05:35:05,752
AS IF SHE WERE THE ADVOCATE FOR 

10741
05:35:05,752 --> 05:35:06,985
DOCTOR FORD TO MAKE HER FEEL 

10742
05:35:06,985 --> 05:35:09,489
SECURE.  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 

10743
05:35:09,489 --> 05:35:10,456
SHE HAS TO DO WITH BRETT 

10744
05:35:10,456 --> 05:35:11,191
KAVANAUGH.  SHE HAS TO BE HIS 

10745
05:35:11,191 --> 05:35:14,027
PARTNER IN THIS.  BRETT 

10746
05:35:14,027 --> 05:35:17,430
KAVANAUGH HAS GOT TO SHOW HIS 

10747
05:35:17,430 --> 05:35:19,032
HUMANITY.  WE ARE USED TO 

10748
05:35:19,032 --> 05:35:19,766
LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S 

10749
05:35:19,766 --> 05:35:21,300
CONFIRMATION HEARING OF WHETHER 

10750
05:35:21,300 --> 05:35:23,369
OR NOT THEY HAVE THE FITNESS TO 

10751
05:35:23,369 --> 05:35:27,574
BE IN LIFE TENURED APPOINTMENT 

10752
05:35:27,574 --> 05:35:29,309
TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 

10753
05:35:29,309 --> 05:35:31,878
COURT WHICH IS MAKING THE LAW, 

10754
05:35:31,878 --> 05:35:32,812
INTERPRETING THE LAW FOR THE 

10755
05:35:32,812 --> 05:35:34,914
ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHICH COULD, 

10756
05:35:34,914 --> 05:35:37,817
FOR HIM, BE 30 OR 40 YEARS.  

10757
05:35:37,817 --> 05:35:40,954
IS HE THAT? SHE HAS TO SHOW HIM 

10758
05:35:40,954 --> 05:35:45,758
TO BE FIT . THE IS A 

10759
05:35:45,758 --> 05:35:46,392
CONTRADICTION.  YOU HAVE TO BE 

10760
05:35:46,392 --> 05:35:47,426
FACTUAL AND YOU HAVE TO BE 

10761
05:35:47,426 --> 05:35:47,660
CALM.  

10762
05:35:47,660 --> 05:35:51,030
AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR LIFE AND 

10763
05:35:51,030 --> 05:35:53,132
YOUR FAMILIES LIFE HAS BEEN 

10764
05:35:53,132 --> 05:35:53,833
UPENDED AND WE NEED TO SEE YOUR 

10765
05:35:53,833 --> 05:35:54,934
PAIN.  

10766
05:35:54,934 --> 05:35:58,671
>> THE CHALLENGE FOR KAVANAUGH 

10767
05:35:58,671 --> 05:35:59,305
IS HE IS A LAWYER AND ONE OF 

10768
05:35:59,305 --> 05:35:59,972
THE SENATORS MADE THE POINT HE 

10769
05:35:59,972 --> 05:36:00,773
IS USED TO BEING IN THE SENATE, 

10770
05:36:00,773 --> 05:36:04,944
BUT HE'S NOT LIKE A TRIAL 

10771
05:36:04,944 --> 05:36:05,578
LAWYER OR THIS POLISHED GUY.  

10772
05:36:05,578 --> 05:36:06,178
IS NOT SOMEONE WHO GOES ON 

10773
05:36:06,178 --> 05:36:06,612
TELEVISION A LOT.  

10774
05:36:06,612 --> 05:36:10,917
HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH, HE'S AN 

10775
05:36:10,917 --> 05:36:12,952
INTELLECTUAL.  

10776
05:36:12,952 --> 05:36:13,619
HE IS CLOISTERED AWAY IN THAT 

10777
05:36:13,619 --> 05:36:13,953
IVORY TOWER.  

10778
05:36:13,953 --> 05:36:14,621
HE IS A LAW PROFESSOR.  

10779
05:36:14,621 --> 05:36:17,290
THIS IS NOT A NATURAL FORM FOR 

10780
05:36:17,290 --> 05:36:18,458
HIM BY ANY MEANS. 

10781
05:36:18,458 --> 05:36:22,262
>>  BUT A MORE NATURAL FORUM FOR

10782
05:36:22,262 --> 05:36:22,595
HIM THAT HER. 

10783
05:36:22,595 --> 05:36:26,032
>>  NOT NECESSARILY. 

10784
05:36:26,032 --> 05:36:26,732
>>  SHE HAS GONE THROUGH SOME 

10785
05:36:26,732 --> 05:36:27,166
HEARINGS ARE READY. 

10786
05:36:27,166 --> 05:36:37,310
>>  BUT NOT NECESSARILY.  

10787
05:36:37,310 --> 05:36:37,911
>> HERE SO DEALING WITH THE 

10788
05:36:37,911 --> 05:36:38,511
FACT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 

10789
05:36:38,511 --> 05:36:39,112
GOING TO HAVE TO FACE CROSS-

10790
05:36:39,112 --> 05:36:39,779
EXAMINATION FROM THE DEMOCRATS. 

10791
05:36:39,779 --> 05:36:40,446
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD 

10792
05:36:40,446 --> 05:36:40,747
PLAY THIS? 

10793
05:36:40,747 --> 05:36:45,018
>> I THINK THEY NEED TO BE FIRM

10794
05:36:45,018 --> 05:36:45,752
.  I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO DO 

10795
05:36:45,752 --> 05:36:46,319
WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO, 

10796
05:36:46,319 --> 05:36:47,253
WHICH IS TO GO BACK, 

10797
05:36:47,253 --> 05:36:51,057
PARTICULARLY INTO THAT FOX NEWS 

10798
05:36:51,057 --> 05:36:51,957
INTERVIEW STATEMENTS THAT WAS 

10799
05:36:51,957 --> 05:36:53,359
SO ILL ADVISED.  

10800
05:36:53,359 --> 05:36:54,393
HE MADE BROAD STATEMENTS ABOUT 

10801
05:36:54,393 --> 05:36:56,763
THE TYPE OF LIFE THAT HE LED, 

10802
05:36:56,763 --> 05:36:58,931
WHICH THEN ALLOWED PEOPLE FROM 

10803
05:36:58,931 --> 05:37:03,803
YALE TO COME FORWARD AND SAY IT 

10804
05:37:03,803 --> 05:37:04,237
WASN'T LIKE THAT.  

10805
05:37:04,237 --> 05:37:13,880
>> NORAH O'DONNELL IS STILL 

10806
05:37:13,880 --> 05:37:14,480
STANDING HIGH ON THE HILL.  

10807
05:37:14,480 --> 05:37:15,047
>> Reporter: I HAVE BEEN 

10808
05:37:15,047 --> 05:37:15,681
TALKING TO OFFICIALS CLOSE TO 

10809
05:37:15,681 --> 05:37:16,282
KEVIN UPPER KEYS THE PERSON 

10810
05:37:16,282 --> 05:37:16,883
THAT WILL BE TESTIFYING NEXT 

10811
05:37:16,883 --> 05:37:17,550
WEEK I'M TOLD HE WILL COME BACK 

10812
05:37:17,550 --> 05:37:18,151
MUCH MORE FORCEFULLY THEN HE 

10813
05:37:18,151 --> 05:37:18,584
HAS IN THE PAST.  

10814
05:37:18,584 --> 05:37:21,588
CALLING THIS A GROTESQUE AND 

10815
05:37:21,588 --> 05:37:26,259
OBVIOUS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION

10816
05:37:26,259 --> 05:37:26,859
.  HE DID, I'M TOLD JUDGE 

10817
05:37:26,859 --> 05:37:29,362
KAVANAUGH, DID WATCH MOST OF 

10818
05:37:29,362 --> 05:37:29,762
THIS TESTIMONY.  

10819
05:37:29,762 --> 05:37:30,396
COMPLETELY DENIES THAT HE WAS 

10820
05:37:30,396 --> 05:37:32,398
AT THAT HOUSE AND THAT HE 

10821
05:37:32,398 --> 05:37:37,070
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED DOCTOR FORD. 

10822
05:37:37,070 --> 05:37:38,304
I THINK YOU GOT A SENSE FROM 

10823
05:37:38,304 --> 05:37:39,005
LISTENING TO SENATOR LINDSEY 

10824
05:37:39,005 --> 05:37:39,772
GRAHAM THAT REPUBLICANS ARE 

10825
05:37:39,772 --> 05:37:40,940
READY TO WAGE WAR.  

10826
05:37:40,940 --> 05:37:53,920
REALLY START A BURROW INTO SOME 

10827
05:37:53,920 --> 05:37:54,554
OF THOSE, BUT THEY BELIEVE, OUR 

10828
05:37:54,554 --> 05:37:54,987
CREDIBILITY GAPS.  

10829
05:37:54,987 --> 05:37:55,621
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK THOSE 

10830
05:37:55,621 --> 05:37:56,122
ARE CREDIBILITY GAPS.  

10831
05:37:56,122 --> 05:37:56,656
REPUBLICANS CLEARLY DO.  

10832
05:37:56,656 --> 05:37:57,256
THEY WILL BRING UP WHAT THEY 

10833
05:37:57,256 --> 05:37:57,824
BELIEVE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT 

10834
05:37:57,824 --> 05:37:58,458
ACCOUNTS OF HOW MANY DIFFERENT 

10835
05:37:58,458 --> 05:37:59,058
PEOPLE WERE AT THAT PARTY.  

10836
05:37:59,058 --> 05:37:59,659
AS ONE OFFICIAL SAID, THEY'RE 

10837
05:37:59,659 --> 05:38:00,293
GOING TO POKE HOLES INTO HER 

10838
05:38:00,293 --> 05:38:03,696
CREDIBILITY AT THE SAME TIME I 

10839
05:38:03,696 --> 05:38:04,330
HAVE ALSO SPOKEN WITH A WHITE 

10840
05:38:04,330 --> 05:38:04,964
HOUSE OFFICIAL WHO ADMITTED IT 

10841
05:38:04,964 --> 05:38:07,633
WAS VERY COMPELLING TEST JUST 

10842
05:38:07,633 --> 05:38:08,267
VERY COMPELLING TESTIMONY THAT 

10843
05:38:08,267 --> 05:38:08,567
SHE GAVE.  

10844
05:38:08,567 --> 05:38:09,502
UNTIL THE PRESIDENT DID WATCH 

10845
05:38:09,502 --> 05:38:12,705
MOST OF DOCTOR FORD'S 

10846
05:38:12,705 --> 05:38:13,006
TESTIMONY.  

10847
05:38:13,006 --> 05:38:13,706
NOT ALL OF IT BECAUSE HE WAS IN 

10848
05:38:13,706 --> 05:38:26,285
NEW YORK FOR THE UN MEETING.  

10849
05:38:26,285 --> 05:38:26,919
HE WAS TRAVELING BACK DOWN TO 

10850
05:38:26,919 --> 05:38:27,553
WASHINGTON, BUT DID WATCH SOME 

10851
05:38:27,553 --> 05:38:28,020
OF THAT TESTIMONY.  

10852
05:38:28,020 --> 05:38:28,754
I THINK JUST TO TO SET UP WHAT 

10853
05:38:28,754 --> 05:38:29,354
WE ARE ABOUT TO HEAR, TO BE 

10854
05:38:29,354 --> 05:38:30,055
INCREDIBLY COMPELLING AS YOU 

10855
05:38:30,055 --> 05:38:30,689
ALL WATCHED THIS MORNING ALONG 

10856
05:38:30,689 --> 05:38:33,726
WITH ME, DOCTOR FORD SAID SHE 

10857
05:38:33,726 --> 05:38:36,962
IS 100% SURE THAT IT WAS BRETT 

10858
05:38:36,962 --> 05:38:37,797
KAVANAUGH WHO SEXUALLY 

10859
05:38:37,797 --> 05:38:41,367
ASSAULTED HER.  SPECIFICALLY, 

10860
05:38:41,367 --> 05:38:42,368
DESCRIBING THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL 

10861
05:38:42,368 --> 05:38:43,870
REASONS WHY SHE REMEMBERS THAT 

10862
05:38:43,870 --> 05:38:48,141
SO CLEARLY.  YOU ARE NOW, 

10863
05:38:48,141 --> 05:38:48,741
ACCORDING TO PEOPLE I HAVE 

10864
05:38:48,741 --> 05:38:55,381
SPOKEN WITH, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS 

10865
05:38:55,381 --> 05:38:55,981
GOING TO CALL THIS CHARACTER 

10866
05:38:55,981 --> 05:38:56,615
ASSASSINATION ALONG WITH SOME 

10867
05:38:56,615 --> 05:38:57,216
OF THE OTHER ALLEGATIONS THAT 

10868
05:38:57,216 --> 05:38:57,850
HAVE BEEN MAJOR KEY BELIEVES HE 

10869
05:38:57,850 --> 05:39:00,620
IS NOT ONLY DEFENDING HIS 

10870
05:39:00,620 --> 05:39:01,754
CREDIBILITY, BUT ALSO HIS 

10871
05:39:01,754 --> 05:39:04,390
REPUTATION AND HIS CHARACTER, 

10872
05:39:04,390 --> 05:39:05,591
WHICH IS WHAT THIS HAS LARGELY 

10873
05:39:05,591 --> 05:39:08,460
BEEN ABOUT, BUT ABILITY AND 

10874
05:39:08,460 --> 05:39:08,761
CHARACTER.  

10875
05:39:08,761 --> 05:39:10,930
I THINK YOU'LL SEE LINDSEY 

10876
05:39:10,930 --> 05:39:15,000
GRAHAM AND SOME OF THE OTHER 

10877
05:39:15,000 --> 05:39:15,634
REPUBLICAN SENATORS PUSH BACK 

10878
05:39:15,634 --> 05:39:15,868
HARD.  

10879
05:39:15,868 --> 05:39:16,535
THE TWO PEOPLE TO WATCH FOR ON 

10880
05:39:16,535 --> 05:39:17,169
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE ARE SENATOR 

10881
05:39:17,169 --> 05:39:18,971
BEEN SASS, A REPUBLICAN FROM 

10882
05:39:18,971 --> 05:39:23,276
NEBRASKA, WHO, ACCORDING TO 

10883
05:39:23,276 --> 05:39:23,876
REPORTS INSIDE THE ROOM, WAS 

10884
05:39:23,876 --> 05:39:24,610
ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICAN 

10885
05:39:24,610 --> 05:39:29,115
SENATORS WHO SPECIFICALLY WENT 

10886
05:39:29,115 --> 05:39:29,715
OVER TO DOCTOR FORD AND SHOOK 

10887
05:39:29,715 --> 05:39:30,383
HER HAND AND SAID THANK YOU FOR 

10888
05:39:30,383 --> 05:39:30,716
BEING HERE.  

10889
05:39:30,716 --> 05:39:32,952
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED HER IN 

10890
05:39:32,952 --> 05:39:33,252
PERSON.  

10891
05:39:33,252 --> 05:39:33,786
HE HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF 

10892
05:39:33,786 --> 05:39:34,420
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON A NUMBER OF 

10893
05:39:34,420 --> 05:39:35,020
ISSUES BUT I WOULD WATCH HIM 

10894
05:39:35,020 --> 05:39:37,690
VERY, VERY CLOSELY WITH THE 

10895
05:39:37,690 --> 05:39:38,557
OTHER PERSON TO WATCH IS 

10896
05:39:38,557 --> 05:39:39,958
SENATOR FLAKE WHO IS RETIRING 

10897
05:39:39,958 --> 05:39:42,027
PUP JUST REPUBLICAN FROM 

10898
05:39:42,027 --> 05:39:44,297
ARIZONA WHO HAS SAID IT IS VERY 

10899
05:39:44,297 --> 05:39:45,832
IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM HER.  

10900
05:39:45,832 --> 05:39:50,036
WATCHES QUESTIONING AS WELL 

10901
05:39:50,036 --> 05:39:50,436
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

10902
05:39:50,436 --> 05:39:51,070
THESE ARE REALLY QUESTIONS 

10903
05:39:51,070 --> 05:39:55,007
ABOUT CARE.  IN PARTICULAR THE 

10904
05:39:55,007 --> 05:39:56,609
DEMOCRATS WILL BE VERY, VERY 

10905
05:39:56,609 --> 05:39:58,377
TOUGH ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH I 

10906
05:39:58,377 --> 05:39:59,412
THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT 

10907
05:39:59,412 --> 05:40:01,180
OF FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH.  

10908
05:40:01,180 --> 05:40:02,948
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY PARTISAN 

10909
05:40:02,948 --> 05:40:06,052
COMMITTEE AS FAR AS I'M TOLD 

10910
05:40:06,052 --> 05:40:07,987
THE BOAT IN THIS COMMITTEE IS 

10911
05:40:07,987 --> 05:40:08,587
STILL GOING FORWARD TOMORROW 

10912
05:40:08,587 --> 05:40:10,990
MORNING NO MATTER WHAT IT'S 

10913
05:40:10,990 --> 05:40:12,792
LIKE THAT'S GOING TO BE 

10914
05:40:12,792 --> 05:40:13,125
INTERESTING. 

10915
05:40:13,125 --> 05:40:13,926
>>  FOR SURE.  

10916
05:40:13,926 --> 05:40:17,396
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.  I'M 

10917
05:40:17,396 --> 05:40:23,168
CURIOUS, IN 1991 WHEN CLARENCE 

10918
05:40:23,168 --> 05:40:23,836
THOMAS TESTIFIED AT ANITA HILL 

10919
05:40:23,836 --> 05:40:25,771
DID AS WELL, HOW DID HE PREPARE 

10920
05:40:25,771 --> 05:40:26,906
FOR THAT AND HOW DID HE 

10921
05:40:26,906 --> 05:40:31,878
ESTABLISH THE KIND OF TONE THAT 

10922
05:40:31,878 --> 05:40:32,278
HE WANTED TO SET? 

10923
05:40:32,278 --> 05:40:32,912
>> HE SAT DOWN AT HIS KITCHEN 

10924
05:40:32,912 --> 05:40:35,014
TABLE WITH A NOTE BOOK ABOUT 

10925
05:40:35,014 --> 05:40:36,582
LIKE THIS AND WROTE IT ALL OUT 

10926
05:40:36,582 --> 05:40:38,918
BY HAND.  

10927
05:40:38,918 --> 05:40:42,955
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN AN 

10928
05:40:42,955 --> 05:40:43,589
INTERVIEW ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO, 

10929
05:40:43,589 --> 05:40:46,926
IT IS STILL VERY RAW.  

10930
05:40:46,926 --> 05:40:48,894
HE SAID HE COULDN'T SLEEP.  

10931
05:40:48,894 --> 05:40:49,495
HE COULDN'T DECIDE HOW TO SAY 

10932
05:40:49,495 --> 05:40:50,129
IT AND CRAFT HIS STATEMENT.  

10933
05:40:50,129 --> 05:40:55,434
HE GOT UP EARLY IN THE MORNING 

10934
05:40:55,434 --> 05:40:56,034
AND SAT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE 

10935
05:40:56,034 --> 05:40:56,702
AND THE WORDS JUST CAME OUT.  

10936
05:40:56,702 --> 05:40:57,369
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO BACK 

10937
05:40:57,369 --> 05:40:58,337
AND LOOK AT THAT TESTIMONY.  

10938
05:40:58,337 --> 05:40:59,772
IT IS WHITE-HOT TESTIMONY.  

10939
05:40:59,772 --> 05:41:02,174
IT IS LIKE FIRE.  

10940
05:41:02,174 --> 05:41:02,674
HE DID NOT DO THIS.  

10941
05:41:02,674 --> 05:41:04,043
THIS IS A TRAVESTY.  

10942
05:41:04,043 --> 05:41:06,279
HIS WHOLE LIFE, HIS REPUTATION, 

10943
05:41:06,279 --> 05:41:07,380
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD WORKED 

10944
05:41:07,380 --> 05:41:15,521
TO BUILD HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY 

10945
05:41:15,521 --> 05:41:16,122
FROM HIM BY THE SENATORS.  

10946
05:41:16,122 --> 05:41:16,622
HE TALKED ABOUT IN THE 

10947
05:41:16,622 --> 05:41:17,289
INTERVIEW HOW HE REALLY FELT IT 

10948
05:41:17,289 --> 05:41:17,823
WAS AN ISSUE OF RACE.  

10949
05:41:17,823 --> 05:41:18,290
I THINK THAT'S A BIG 

10950
05:41:18,290 --> 05:41:18,724
DISTINCTION HERE.  

10951
05:41:18,724 --> 05:41:19,358
WHEN SOME OF THE SENATORS WERE 

10952
05:41:19,358 --> 05:41:22,962
QUESTIONING HIM HE FELT LIKE HE 

10953
05:41:22,962 --> 05:41:23,562
WAS LIKE A PLANTATION OWNER 

10954
05:41:23,562 --> 05:41:26,766
TALKING DOWN TO HIM LIKE HE 

10955
05:41:26,766 --> 05:41:29,368
EVEN USED THE TERM LYNCHING AT 

10956
05:41:29,368 --> 05:41:30,870
THAT TIME.  

10957
05:41:30,870 --> 05:41:31,871
>> THAT'S A VERY VOLATILE WORD. 

10958
05:41:31,871 --> 05:41:33,172
I'M CURIOUS, IS THIS THE 

10959
05:41:33,172 --> 05:41:37,043
ULTIMATE HE SAID SHE SAID? 

10960
05:41:37,043 --> 05:41:37,743
SHE SAID HE'S 100% SURE IS THAT 

10961
05:41:37,743 --> 05:41:38,344
HIM.  

10962
05:41:38,344 --> 05:41:40,312
HE SAYS NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT ME, 

10963
05:41:40,312 --> 05:41:40,779
I WASN'T EVEN THERE. 

10964
05:41:40,779 --> 05:41:42,248
>>  YES.  

10965
05:41:42,248 --> 05:41:45,384
IT IS A HE SAID, SHE SAID. 

10966
05:41:45,384 --> 05:41:46,084
>>  HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHO IS 

10967
05:41:46,084 --> 05:41:46,952
TELLING THE TRUTH? 

10968
05:41:46,952 --> 05:41:49,521
>> HOW DO WE DO IT IN A COURT 

10969
05:41:49,521 --> 05:41:49,755
OF LAW? 

10970
05:41:49,755 --> 05:41:51,623
HERE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS 

10971
05:41:51,623 --> 05:41:52,858
IS NOT A COURT OF LAW.  

10972
05:41:52,858 --> 05:41:57,863
WE ARE ONLY LOOKING, 

10973
05:41:57,863 --> 05:41:58,497
ULTIMATELY, FOR THE FINAL VOTE 

10974
05:41:58,497 --> 05:41:58,965
OF A FEW SENATORS.  

10975
05:41:58,965 --> 05:42:00,600
WE BELIEVE THAT THE SENATORS, 

10976
05:42:00,600 --> 05:42:01,234
NO MATTER WHAT, ARE GOING TO 

10977
05:42:01,234 --> 05:42:02,267
VOTE ALONG PARTY LINES WITH THE 

10978
05:42:02,267 --> 05:42:04,303
EXCEPTION OF A FEW.  

10979
05:42:04,303 --> 05:42:07,072
THOUGH, I COULD BE SURPRISED, I 

10980
05:42:07,072 --> 05:42:11,210
SUPPOSE.  

10981
05:42:11,210 --> 05:42:11,877
WHENEVER THERE ARE WITNESSES AT 

10982
05:42:11,877 --> 05:42:12,578
TRIAL WHO BOTH SEEM TO HAVE AN 

10983
05:42:12,578 --> 05:42:13,145
AURA OF CREDIBILITY AND YOU 

10984
05:42:13,145 --> 05:42:15,014
HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE YOU HAVE 

10985
05:42:15,014 --> 05:42:17,450
TO DECIDE WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES 

10986
05:42:17,450 --> 05:42:19,484
YOU THINK THAT THIS ONE IS 

10987
05:42:19,484 --> 05:42:22,688
TELLING THE TRUTH.  IN DOCTOR 

10988
05:42:22,688 --> 05:42:25,524
FORD'S TESTIMONY WHAT WE DO KNOW

10989
05:42:25,524 --> 05:42:26,692
IS THAT IN ADDITION TO PASSING 

10990
05:42:26,692 --> 05:42:31,397
A POLYGRAPH AND, YES, I KNOW 

10991
05:42:31,397 --> 05:42:32,064
SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT JUNK 

10992
05:42:32,064 --> 05:42:32,698
SCIENCE, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, 

10993
05:42:32,698 --> 05:42:38,203
IN MY OWN PRACTICE WHEN I USED 

10994
05:42:38,203 --> 05:42:38,870
TO HAVE DEFENDANTS WHO HAD BEEN 

10995
05:42:38,870 --> 05:42:39,504
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I 

10996
05:42:39,504 --> 05:42:40,639
WOULD ASK THEM IF THEY WOULD 

10997
05:42:40,639 --> 05:42:43,009
TAKE A CONFIDENTIAL POLYGRAPH 

10998
05:42:43,009 --> 05:42:47,213
FOR ME AND NOT TO WORRY THAT 

10999
05:42:47,213 --> 05:42:47,847
THEY ARE MOSTLY INCONCLUSIVE 

11000
05:42:47,847 --> 05:42:48,481
AND NOT TO FEAR ANYTHING ABOUT 

11001
05:42:48,481 --> 05:42:53,552
IT, IF THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY 

11002
05:42:53,552 --> 05:42:54,219
WOULDN'T THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO 

11003
05:42:54,219 --> 05:42:54,453
HEAR.  

11004
05:42:54,453 --> 05:42:58,691
I WOULD IT REPRESENT THOSE 

11005
05:42:58,691 --> 05:42:59,125
PEOPLE.  

11006
05:42:59,125 --> 05:42:59,792
PUBLICLY ABOUT 80% OF THEM SAID 

11007
05:42:59,792 --> 05:43:00,326
THEY WOULD TAKE IT . THE 

11008
05:43:00,326 --> 05:43:02,795
POLYGRAPH DOES HAVE VALUE TO ME 

11009
05:43:02,795 --> 05:43:03,295
AND TO OTHER PEOPLE.  

11010
05:43:03,295 --> 05:43:04,363
IN ADDITION, SHE HAS TOLD OTHER 

11011
05:43:04,363 --> 05:43:10,969
PEOPLE ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

11012
05:43:10,969 --> 05:43:11,603
ALTHOUGH, SHE HAS TOLD THEM IN 

11013
05:43:11,603 --> 05:43:12,237
MORE RECENT TIMES BUT THE FACT 

11014
05:43:12,237 --> 05:43:12,805
THAT SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER 

11015
05:43:12,805 --> 05:43:14,573
CERTAIN THINGS AND THAT IT DOES 

11016
05:43:14,573 --> 05:43:16,342
CHANGE A BIT HERE AND THERE 

11017
05:43:16,342 --> 05:43:20,179
ASKED HER NUMBERS AND PLACES, 

11018
05:43:20,179 --> 05:43:22,915
ULTIMATELY, THOSE KIND OF 

11019
05:43:22,915 --> 05:43:27,620
INCONVENIENT TRUTHS MAKE HER 

11020
05:43:27,620 --> 05:43:28,254
MORE CREDIBLE TO MANY PEOPLE. 

11021
05:43:28,254 --> 05:43:28,954
>>  THIS FEELS DIFFERENT TO ME. 

11022
05:43:28,954 --> 05:43:32,457
IN MANY CASES THEY WILL SAY HE 

11023
05:43:32,457 --> 05:43:33,058
SAID, SHE SAID CONSENSUAL OR 

11024
05:43:33,058 --> 05:43:33,458
NOT CONSENSUAL.  

11025
05:43:33,458 --> 05:43:37,930
THIS IS A CASE WHERE HE IS A 

11026
05:43:37,930 --> 05:43:38,564
NOT ONLY DID I NOT DO IT, BUT 

11027
05:43:38,564 --> 05:43:39,064
IT WASN'T EVEN THERE. 

11028
05:43:39,064 --> 05:43:39,364
>>  RIGHT.  

11029
05:43:39,364 --> 05:43:40,799
>> YOU HAVE SUCH A STARK DIVIDE 

11030
05:43:40,799 --> 05:43:42,635
HERE.  

11031
05:43:42,635 --> 05:43:51,777
HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A LOT OF 

11032
05:43:51,777 --> 05:43:52,377
ROOM IN TERMS OF THE INITIAL 

11033
05:43:52,377 --> 05:43:52,944
DENIALS OF WHAT HAPPENED OR 

11034
05:43:52,944 --> 05:43:53,311
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

11035
05:43:53,311 --> 05:43:53,879
>>  HE'S NOT CALLING HER A 

11036
05:43:53,879 --> 05:43:55,748
LIAR, HE'S SAYING THAT SHE HAS 

11037
05:43:55,748 --> 05:43:56,449
SOMEHOW BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 

11038
05:43:56,449 --> 05:44:00,953
BY SOMEONE, OR AT LEAST THAT IS 

11039
05:44:00,953 --> 05:44:01,554
WHAT HE HAS SET ON FOX NEWS, 

11040
05:44:01,554 --> 05:44:02,454
AND THAT SHE HAS UNDERGONE A 

11041
05:44:02,454 --> 05:44:03,389
TRAUMA, BUT IT WAS NOT HIM. 

11042
05:44:03,389 --> 05:44:07,793
>>  AS YOU MENTIONED BEFORE, 

11043
05:44:07,793 --> 05:44:08,427
RACHEL MITCHELL DIDN'T GET INTO 

11044
05:44:08,427 --> 05:44:08,994
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED 

11045
05:44:08,994 --> 05:44:12,832
INSIDE THAT BEDROOM BECAUSE OF 

11046
05:44:12,832 --> 05:44:13,766
WHAT HE SAID BEFORE AND WHAT 

11047
05:44:13,766 --> 05:44:14,933
SHE ANTICIPATES.  I THINK HE 

11048
05:44:14,933 --> 05:44:17,236
WILL SAY THIS AFTERNOON AS WE 

11049
05:44:17,236 --> 05:44:20,372
MOVE THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON -- 

11050
05:44:20,372 --> 05:44:21,006
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS 

11051
05:44:21,006 --> 05:44:22,908
YOU HAVE ABOUT THE NEXT FEW 

11052
05:44:22,908 --> 05:44:23,675
HOURS? 

11053
05:44:23,675 --> 05:44:24,309
>> HOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING 

11054
05:44:24,309 --> 05:44:25,978
TO, FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL HEAR 

11055
05:44:25,978 --> 05:44:28,314
FROM KAVANAUGH FIRST SO HIS 

11056
05:44:28,314 --> 05:44:31,283
STATEMENT.  HIS DEMEANOR.  

11057
05:44:31,283 --> 05:44:32,485
CERTAINLY, I WOULD NOT EXPECT 

11058
05:44:32,485 --> 05:44:33,985
HIM FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT 

11059
05:44:33,985 --> 05:44:36,722
WATCHED HIS INTERVIEW ON FOX 

11060
05:44:36,722 --> 05:44:40,559
NEWS, WHERE HE SEEMED, HE WAS 

11061
05:44:40,559 --> 05:44:41,394
TWO MEASURED -- TO MEASURED.  

11062
05:44:41,394 --> 05:44:43,696
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDIGNATION 

11063
05:44:43,696 --> 05:44:44,463
OR ANGER.  

11064
05:44:44,463 --> 05:44:46,665
HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED NONE OF 

11065
05:44:46,665 --> 05:44:47,332
THIS CAME UP YET, BUT SOME OF 

11066
05:44:47,332 --> 05:44:48,768
THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN 

11067
05:44:48,768 --> 05:44:53,238
PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY.  INCLUDING

11068
05:44:53,238 --> 05:44:53,939
GANG RAPE AND BEING AT PARTIES 

11069
05:44:53,939 --> 05:44:54,506
WHERE MULTIPLE YOUNG HIGH 

11070
05:44:54,506 --> 05:44:55,875
SCHOOL GIRLS WERE BEING RAPED 

11071
05:44:55,875 --> 05:44:57,943
OVER WEEKENDS IN BETHESDA.  

11072
05:44:57,943 --> 05:45:07,253
ON ITS FACE YOU WOULD THINK 

11073
05:45:07,253 --> 05:45:07,886
SOMEBODY ACCUSED OF THAT WAS A 

11074
05:45:07,886 --> 05:45:08,320
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 

11075
05:45:08,320 --> 05:45:08,621
SERIOUSLY? 

11076
05:45:08,621 --> 05:45:09,521
WE DIDN'T SEE THAT IN THAT FOX 

11077
05:45:09,521 --> 05:45:09,955
NEWS INTERVIEW.  

11078
05:45:09,955 --> 05:45:11,390
I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF 

11079
05:45:11,390 --> 05:45:14,260
THAT ANGER IN HIS OPENING 

11080
05:45:14,260 --> 05:45:14,593
STATEMENT.  

11081
05:45:14,593 --> 05:45:15,227
I WILL ALSO BE VERY CURIOUS TO 

11082
05:45:15,227 --> 05:45:16,896
SEE HOW THE DEMOCRATS GO AFTER 

11083
05:45:16,896 --> 05:45:19,031
HIM ON HIS PERSONAL BEHAVIOR 

11084
05:45:19,031 --> 05:45:22,834
AND IF THESE OUTSIDE 

11085
05:45:22,834 --> 05:45:23,368
ALLEGATIONS ARE RAISED.  

11086
05:45:23,368 --> 05:45:23,935
THEY WANT THIS TO BE, THEY 

11087
05:45:23,935 --> 05:45:26,806
DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THESE 

11088
05:45:26,806 --> 05:45:27,440
ALLEGATIONS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT 

11089
05:45:27,440 --> 05:45:29,174
FORD WHO THEY BELIEVE, BASED ON 

11090
05:45:29,174 --> 05:45:33,012
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING, DID 

11091
05:45:33,012 --> 05:45:33,345
VERY WELL.  

11092
05:45:33,345 --> 05:45:33,879
KEEP THE FOCUS ON HER. 

11093
05:45:33,879 --> 05:45:35,014
>>  THE POLITICAL QUESTION WILL 

11094
05:45:35,014 --> 05:45:37,148
BE WHO SETS THE TERMS OF THE 

11095
05:45:37,148 --> 05:45:38,250
DEBATE AFTER THIS IS OVER? 

11096
05:45:38,250 --> 05:45:40,519
DOES IT BECOME DO YOU BELIEVE 

11097
05:45:40,519 --> 05:45:40,852
DOCTOR FORD? 

11098
05:45:40,852 --> 05:45:42,955
IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT'S NOT 

11099
05:45:42,955 --> 05:45:44,490
GREAT FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH.  

11100
05:45:44,490 --> 05:45:48,093
IF IT BECOMES DO YOU BELIEVE 

11101
05:45:48,093 --> 05:45:48,693
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HE GIVES 

11102
05:45:48,693 --> 05:45:51,063
THE KIND OF STRONG DEFENSIVE 

11103
05:45:51,063 --> 05:45:52,163
HIMSELF, WHAT HE NEEDS TO 

11104
05:45:52,163 --> 05:45:55,334
PROVIDE IS A COMPELLING DEFENSE 

11105
05:45:55,334 --> 05:45:56,402
OF A SENATORS VOTE.  

11106
05:45:56,402 --> 05:45:58,037
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY I 

11107
05:45:58,037 --> 05:46:00,272
ELEVATED HIM BECAUSE OF X IF 

11108
05:46:00,272 --> 05:46:01,340
THEY CAN SAY BECAUSE I FOUND 

11109
05:46:01,340 --> 05:46:02,808
HIM CREDIBLE THAT HELPS THOSE 

11110
05:46:02,808 --> 05:46:05,344
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE GOING TO 

11111
05:46:05,344 --> 05:46:05,777
NEED TO VOTE. 

11112
05:46:05,777 --> 05:46:08,847
>>  DOES IT EVER BECOME I 

11113
05:46:08,847 --> 05:46:09,281
BELIEVE THEM BOTH? 

11114
05:46:09,281 --> 05:46:11,483
>> YOU COULD LEAVE BOTH.  

11115
05:46:11,483 --> 05:46:12,485
IN AN ODD WAY.  

11116
05:46:12,485 --> 05:46:14,920
YOU COULD BELIEVE THAT SHE 

11117
05:46:14,920 --> 05:46:15,988
BELIEVES SHE IS TELLING THE 

11118
05:46:15,988 --> 05:46:18,623
TRUTH SHE FIRMLY BELIEVES SHE 

11119
05:46:18,623 --> 05:46:22,527
IS TELLING THE TRUTH.  

11120
05:46:22,527 --> 05:46:23,194
>> WHICH IS WHY SHE COULD PASS 

11121
05:46:23,194 --> 05:46:23,561
A LIE DETECTOR. 

11122
05:46:23,561 --> 05:46:27,565
>>  AND THAT HE FIRMLY BELIEVES 

11123
05:46:27,565 --> 05:46:28,133
HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.  

11124
05:46:28,133 --> 05:46:28,968
THEM THAT LEADS YOU DOWN 

11125
05:46:28,968 --> 05:46:31,036
ANOTHER PATH, WHICH IS WHAT WAS 

11126
05:46:31,036 --> 05:46:32,872
HIS BEHAVIOR LIKE AT THIS TIME 

11127
05:46:32,872 --> 05:46:36,675
IN HIS LIFE WITH OTHER PEOPLE? 

11128
05:46:36,675 --> 05:46:37,509
WAS THIS SIMPLY A NIGHT HE 

11129
05:46:37,509 --> 05:46:38,343
DOESN'T REMEMBER? 

11130
05:46:38,343 --> 05:46:40,246
THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HELP 

11131
05:46:40,246 --> 05:46:42,481
HIM.  SUCK WE ARE EXPECTING TO 

11132
05:46:42,481 --> 05:46:45,217
SEE THE JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN THE 

11133
05:46:45,217 --> 05:46:45,984
NEXT TWO OR THREE MINUTES.  

11134
05:46:45,984 --> 05:46:50,923
BEFORE WE GO BACK THERE AND GO 

11135
05:46:50,923 --> 05:46:51,590
TO THE CAMERA THAT IS GOING TO 

11136
05:46:51,590 --> 05:46:53,525
SHOW HIM I WANT TO GO TO ED 

11137
05:46:53,525 --> 05:46:54,193
O

11138
05:46:54,193 --> 05:46:54,793
HE HAS MORE INFORMATION FROM 

11139
05:46:54,793 --> 05:46:55,561
JUST OUTSIDE THAT HEARING ROOM. 

11140
05:46:55,561 --> 05:46:58,964
>> Reporter: YES.  

11141
05:46:58,964 --> 05:47:00,099
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN 

11142
05:47:00,099 --> 05:47:01,933
DISCUSSING PROSECUTOR MITCHELL 

11143
05:47:01,933 --> 05:47:05,437
AND HER ROLE IN ALL OF THIS IT 

11144
05:47:05,437 --> 05:47:06,037
IS GOING TO CHANGE SLIGHTLY 

11145
05:47:06,037 --> 05:47:06,938
ONCE JUDGE KAVANAUGH ENTERS THE 

11146
05:47:06,938 --> 05:47:11,744
ROOM I AM TOLD.  

11147
05:47:11,744 --> 05:47:12,378
SHE IS GOING TO ASK ABOUT 20 

11148
05:47:12,378 --> 05:47:13,012
MINUTES WORTH OF QUESTIONS AT 

11149
05:47:13,012 --> 05:47:14,914
THE BEGINNING.  

11150
05:47:14,914 --> 05:47:16,781
WE WILL EVENTUALLY HEAR FROM AT 

11151
05:47:16,781 --> 05:47:17,382
LEAST SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN 

11152
05:47:17,382 --> 05:47:17,916
MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY 

11153
05:47:17,916 --> 05:47:18,918
COMMITTEE WHEN THEY ARE CALLED 

11154
05:47:18,918 --> 05:47:22,554
UPON TO QUESTION THE JUDGE.  

11155
05:47:22,554 --> 05:47:23,088
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME 

11156
05:47:23,088 --> 05:47:23,688
QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 

11157
05:47:23,688 --> 05:47:24,155
THIS WAS WORTH IT.  

11158
05:47:24,155 --> 05:47:27,059
WHY DOES WAS SHE AN EFFECTIVE 

11159
05:47:27,059 --> 05:47:29,094
INQUISITOR? 

11160
05:47:29,094 --> 05:47:29,661
I CHECKED WITH SOME SENIOR 

11161
05:47:29,661 --> 05:47:32,263
AIDES WHO WORK FOR REPUBLICANS 

11162
05:47:32,263 --> 05:47:32,864
AND IN THE WORDS OF ONE OF 

11163
05:47:32,864 --> 05:47:34,433
THEM, WHAT WAS THE ALTERNATIVE? 

11164
05:47:34,433 --> 05:47:38,504
REMEMBER THE OPTICS OF 11 MEN 

11165
05:47:38,504 --> 05:47:39,104
QUIZZING THIS WOMAN WAS SUCH 

11166
05:47:39,104 --> 05:47:39,705
THAT THEY WERE SO CONCERNED 

11167
05:47:39,705 --> 05:47:40,873
THEY WENT OUT AND FOUND RACHEL 

11168
05:47:40,873 --> 05:47:44,910
MITCHELL TO COME TO THIS.  THEY 

11169
05:47:44,910 --> 05:47:45,544
SAY ULTIMATELY SHE WAS TRYING 

11170
05:47:45,544 --> 05:47:47,346
TO ESTABLISH A FACT PATTERN AND 

11171
05:47:47,346 --> 05:47:49,848
SHE DID THAT TO THE BEST OF HER 

11172
05:47:49,848 --> 05:47:50,181
ABILITY.  

11173
05:47:50,181 --> 05:47:50,815
BEHIND US HERE JUST DOWN THE 

11174
05:47:50,815 --> 05:47:54,119
HALL IS WHERE JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

11175
05:47:54,119 --> 05:47:54,786
IS ACTUALLY CURRENTLY WAITING.  

11176
05:47:54,786 --> 05:47:55,420
HE WILL WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY 

11177
05:47:55,420 --> 05:48:00,659
HERE BACK INTO DO -- BACK INTO 

11178
05:48:00,659 --> 05:48:01,259
THE HEARING ROOM TO SIT DOWN 

11179
05:48:01,259 --> 05:48:02,461
AND BEGIN HIS TESTIMONY.  

11180
05:48:02,461 --> 05:48:07,065
HERE IN DIRKSEN THIS AFTERNOON 

11181
05:48:07,065 --> 05:48:07,699
IT HAS REALLY JUST BEEN COPS 

11182
05:48:07,699 --> 05:48:08,099
AND REPORTERS.  

11183
05:48:08,099 --> 05:48:08,767
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ALLOWING ANY 

11184
05:48:08,767 --> 05:48:09,501
OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC NEAR THIS 

11185
05:48:09,501 --> 05:48:09,868
HEARING ROOM.  

11186
05:48:09,868 --> 05:48:15,007
THAT IS MOSTLY IN DEFERENCE TO 

11187
05:48:15,007 --> 05:48:15,741
DOCTOR FORD AND HOPE THAT THIS 

11188
05:48:15,741 --> 05:48:16,275
WOULD BE A SOMEWHAT MORE 

11189
05:48:16,275 --> 05:48:19,211
DISCREET AND RESPECTFUL EXCHANGE

11190
05:48:19,211 --> 05:48:19,845
.  AS JAN AND OTHERS HAVE 

11191
05:48:19,845 --> 05:48:23,782
POINTED OUT, WE SHOULD EXPECT ú 

11192
05:48:23,782 --> 05:48:24,216
PRETTY QUICKLY.  

11193
05:48:24,216 --> 05:48:26,919
I SUSPECT BY THE TIME WE GET TO 

11194
05:48:26,919 --> 05:48:28,754
SENATOR DICK DURBIN OF 

11195
05:48:28,754 --> 05:48:29,454
ILLINOIS, WHO IS A MORE SENIOR 

11196
05:48:29,454 --> 05:48:31,023
MEMBER OF THE SENATE BUT A 

11197
05:48:31,023 --> 05:48:32,391
PARTISAN WARRIOR NONETHELESS IN 

11198
05:48:32,391 --> 05:48:34,894
THE SECOND RANKING DEMOCRAT THAT

11199
05:48:34,894 --> 05:48:39,031
IT IS AT THAT POINT THE 

11200
05:48:39,031 --> 05:48:41,333
DEMOCRATS REALLY BEGIN TO DIG 

11201
05:48:41,333 --> 05:48:41,933
INTO KAVANAUGH, HIS PERSONAL 

11202
05:48:41,933 --> 05:48:42,601
LIFE, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF 

11203
05:48:42,601 --> 05:48:43,636
THAT SPEAKS TO HIS CREDIBILITY. 

11204
05:48:43,636 --> 05:48:44,737
WE ASKED SOME OF THE MORE 

11205
05:48:44,737 --> 05:48:46,738
JUNIOR DEMOCRATS EARLIER ARE 

11206
05:48:46,738 --> 05:48:47,372
YOU GOING TO DO THAT AND WHY 

11207
05:48:47,372 --> 05:48:48,273
WOULD YOU GO INTO HIS SEX LIFE 

11208
05:48:48,273 --> 05:48:51,377
BRING UP HIS DRINKING? 

11209
05:48:51,377 --> 05:48:52,044
THEY SAID IT ALL SPEAKS TO HIS 

11210
05:48:52,044 --> 05:48:53,479
CREDIBILITY, WHICH IS NOW IN 

11211
05:48:53,479 --> 05:48:56,815
QUESTION AS THIS EXCHANGE 

11212
05:48:56,815 --> 05:48:57,116
CONTINUES. 

11213
05:48:57,116 --> 05:48:58,517
>>  THAT QUESTIONING WILL BE 

11214
05:48:58,517 --> 05:48:58,950
VERY INTERESTING.  

11215
05:48:58,950 --> 05:49:02,955
IT WILL ALSO BE INTERESTING TO 

11216
05:49:02,955 --> 05:49:06,892
WATCH SOME REPUBLICAN 

11217
05:49:06,892 --> 05:49:07,226
QUESTIONING.  

11218
05:49:07,226 --> 05:49:07,926
TO WHAT EXTENT JOHN, JEFF 

11219
05:49:07,926 --> 05:49:13,866
FLAKE, AND BEN SASSE 

11220
05:49:13,866 --> 05:49:14,299
POTENTIALLY SPEAK.  

11221
05:49:14,299 --> 05:49:14,833
THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE 

11222
05:49:14,833 --> 05:49:15,234
COMMITTEE THERE.  

11223
05:49:15,234 --> 05:49:15,901
POTENTIAL SWING VOTES ON ALL OF 

11224
05:49:15,901 --> 05:49:16,101
THIS. 

11225
05:49:16,101 --> 05:49:17,269
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.  WHAT WE THEN 

11226
05:49:17,269 --> 05:49:18,270
LEARNED FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT 

11227
05:49:18,270 --> 05:49:22,408
THE ASK.  

11228
05:49:22,408 --> 05:49:23,008
IN THE QUESTIONS THEY ASKED 

11229
05:49:23,008 --> 05:49:23,642
THEY WILL LAY THE PREDICATE FOR 

11230
05:49:23,642 --> 05:49:25,144
THE FINAL DECISION ON THIS 

11231
05:49:25,144 --> 05:49:25,511
NOMINATION.  

11232
05:49:25,511 --> 05:49:26,078
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAY I 

11233
05:49:26,078 --> 05:49:27,011
ASKED THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I 

11234
05:49:27,011 --> 05:49:28,780
SOUGHT AN ANSWER TO THIS THING. 

11235
05:49:28,780 --> 05:49:33,385
I GOT THE ANSWER I WANTED AND 

11236
05:49:33,385 --> 05:49:34,019
THAT LED ME TO THIS VOTE.  

11237
05:49:34,019 --> 05:49:35,087
AS POLITICIANS THIS IS A MOMENT 

11238
05:49:35,087 --> 05:49:36,521
TO BEGIN A NARRATIVE TO EXPLAIN 

11239
05:49:36,521 --> 05:49:38,824
THEIR VOTE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

11240
05:49:38,824 --> 05:49:44,897
IF THEY GET A CHANCE TO QUESTION

11241
05:49:44,897 --> 05:49:45,531
, THAT'S WHY THERE COULD HAVE 

11242
05:49:45,531 --> 05:49:46,131
BEEN SOME BENEFIT TO HAVING 

11243
05:49:46,131 --> 05:49:46,765
REPUBLICANS ASK THE QUESTIONS.  

11244
05:49:46,765 --> 05:49:48,066
IN ASKING THE QUESTION YOU CAN 

11245
05:49:48,066 --> 05:49:48,733
FRAME THE SHAPE OF THE DEBATE.  

11246
05:49:48,733 --> 05:49:50,902
THIS IS A POLITICAL DEBATE, NOT 

11247
05:49:50,902 --> 05:49:51,269
A COURTROOM.  

11248
05:49:51,269 --> 05:49:52,337
THE ABILITY TO FRAME AND SHAPE 

11249
05:49:52,337 --> 05:49:54,038
THE QUESTION CAN SOMETIMES 

11250
05:49:54,038 --> 05:49:55,106
DETERMINE WHAT THE POLITICS END 

11251
05:49:55,106 --> 05:49:57,109
UP BEING IN THE END EXCEPT WE 

11252
05:49:57,109 --> 05:49:59,478
ARE NOT INSIDE THE COURTROOM OR 

11253
05:49:59,478 --> 05:50:00,879
A GOVERNMENT BUILDING, WE ARE 

11254
05:50:00,879 --> 05:50:03,248
INSIDE THE COURT OF OPINION 

11255
05:50:03,248 --> 05:50:03,448
HERE. 

11256
05:50:03,448 --> 05:50:06,218
>>  IN CERTAIN WAYS I 

11257
05:50:06,218 --> 05:50:06,785
UNDERSTAND THE OPTICS WERE 

11258
05:50:06,785 --> 05:50:08,520
TERRIBLE TO HAVE 11 WHITE MEN 

11259
05:50:08,520 --> 05:50:11,590
GOING AFTER DOCTOR FORD, BUT AT 

11260
05:50:11,590 --> 05:50:16,495
THE SAME TIME, THERE WAS AN 

11261
05:50:16,495 --> 05:50:17,162
ABILITY ALSO, IF THEY HAD, TO 

11262
05:50:17,162 --> 05:50:18,931
B ABLE TO HAVE TREATED HER 

11263
05:50:18,931 --> 05:50:22,634
WITH DIGNITY IN A WAY THAT 

11264
05:50:22,634 --> 05:50:23,235
SENATOR GRASSLEY DID IN HIS 

11265
05:50:23,235 --> 05:50:23,802
OPENING STATEMENT BUT THEY 

11266
05:50:23,802 --> 05:50:24,570
MIGHT HAVE FARED AT HER FOR 

11267
05:50:24,570 --> 05:50:24,770
THAT. 

11268
05:50:24,770 --> 05:50:26,572
>>  YOU SAID IN THE BEGINNING, 

11269
05:50:26,572 --> 05:50:29,874
RICKY, IT WAS VERY HARD FOR 

11270
05:50:29,874 --> 05:50:30,742
RACHEL MITCHELL TO GET A REAL 

11271
05:50:30,742 --> 05:50:31,142
DIALOGUE GOING.  

11272
05:50:31,142 --> 05:50:33,078
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS EFFECTIVE 

11273
05:50:33,078 --> 05:50:35,013
DESPITE THE HANDICAP THAT SHE 

11274
05:50:35,013 --> 05:50:35,280
HAD? 

11275
05:50:35,280 --> 05:50:37,983
>> I DON'T THINK SHE WAS 

11276
05:50:37,983 --> 05:50:38,283
EFFECTIVE.  

11277
05:50:38,283 --> 05:50:39,017
I ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S 

11278
05:50:39,017 --> 05:50:40,486
NECESSARILY HER FAULT EXPECT 

11279
05:50:40,486 --> 05:50:47,859
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IF 

11280
05:50:47,859 --> 05:50:48,393
ANYONE COULD HAVE BEEN 

11281
05:50:48,393 --> 05:50:48,994
EFFECTIVE UNDER THOSE TERMS? 

11282
05:50:48,994 --> 05:50:49,528
>> RIGHT.  

11283
05:50:49,528 --> 05:50:51,797
THE THING THAT HELPS BRETT -- 

11284
05:50:51,797 --> 05:50:53,532
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS IF HE WILL 

11285
05:50:53,532 --> 05:50:56,334
COME IN AND REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

11286
05:50:56,334 --> 05:50:59,004
CAN SAY I FOUND HIM CREDIBLE. 

11287
05:50:59,004 --> 05:51:00,372
>>  I CANNOT.  

11288
05:51:00,372 --> 05:51:00,939
I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE'S A 

11289
05:51:00,939 --> 05:51:01,707
REPUBLICAN ON THAT COMMITTEE 

11290
05:51:01,707 --> 05:51:07,946
THAT IS THINKING, DANG IT, I 

11291
05:51:07,946 --> 05:51:08,547
WISH I HAD MY CHANCE TO SIT 

11292
05:51:08,547 --> 05:51:09,180
DOWN AND ASK HER ALL OF THESE 

11293
05:51:09,180 --> 05:51:09,814
QUESTIONS I COULD HAVE REALLY 

11294
05:51:09,814 --> 05:51:10,615
PUT HER ON THE FIRE.  

11295
05:51:10,615 --> 05:51:11,383
NO ONE BUT THAT WAS FRAUGHT 

11296
05:51:11,383 --> 05:51:11,683
WITH PERIL. 

11297
05:51:11,683 --> 05:51:12,017
>>  IT WAS. 

11298
05:51:12,017 --> 05:51:16,421
>>  IN THIS CLIMATE WHAT THEY 

11299
05:51:16,421 --> 05:51:27,232
WERE ABLE TO DO IN 1991 WHEN 

11300
05:51:27,232 --> 05:51:27,766
ARLAND SPECTOR WAS REALLY 

11301
05:51:27,766 --> 05:51:28,400
GIVING IT TO ANITA HILL IS NOT 

11302
05:51:28,400 --> 05:51:29,034
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN 2018.  

11303
05:51:29,034 --> 05:51:39,711
THIS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A GREAT 

11304
05:51:39,711 --> 05:51:40,311
MORNING FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

11305
05:51:40,311 --> 05:51:40,979
THERE WASN'T KIND ACROSS PEOPLE 

11306
05:51:40,979 --> 05:51:41,479
HOPED FOR, BUT FOR THE 

11307
05:51:41,479 --> 05:51:42,113
REPUBLICANS I WOULD BE STUNNED 

11308
05:51:42,113 --> 05:51:42,814
IF ANY OF THEM THOUGHT I WISH I 

11309
05:51:42,814 --> 05:51:43,448
COULD HAVE DONE THAT, I COULD 

11310
05:51:43,448 --> 05:51:44,015
HAVE REALLY PUT IT TO HER. 

11311
05:51:44,015 --> 05:51:44,649
>>  THEY COULD HAVE ALSO HAD 

11312
05:51:44,649 --> 05:51:45,249
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW SOME 

11313
05:51:45,249 --> 05:51:46,084
GRACE AND COMPASSION AND STILL 

11314
05:51:46,084 --> 05:51:47,119
MAKE THEIR POINT.  

11315
05:51:47,119 --> 05:51:47,920
>> BUT THEY HAVE THE 

11316
05:51:47,920 --> 05:51:50,956
CONSTITUENTS YOU ARE SAYING -- 

11317
05:51:50,956 --> 05:51:56,562
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 

11318
05:51:56,562 --> 05:51:57,162
BELIEVE HIM AND THINK HE HAS 

11319
05:51:57,162 --> 05:51:57,663
BEN UNFAIRLY ACCUSED.  

11320
05:51:57,663 --> 05:51:58,297
HE IS THIS WONDERFUL MAN LOOK 

11321
05:51:58,297 --> 05:52:02,467
WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING TO 

11322
05:52:02,467 --> 05:52:02,667
HIM.  

11323
05:52:02,667 --> 05:52:03,268
THOSE ARE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. 

11324
05:52:03,268 --> 05:52:03,835
>>  THAT'S A GREAT POINT.  

11325
05:52:03,835 --> 05:52:11,243
GOES CONSTITUENTS WOULD SAY WHY 

11326
05:52:11,243 --> 05:52:11,877
DIDN'T YOU REALLY GO AFTER? 

11327
05:52:11,877 --> 05:52:12,344
>> YOU MESSED UP.  

11328
05:52:12,344 --> 05:52:12,911
IT'S YOUR FAULT YOU DIDN'T 

11329
05:52:12,911 --> 05:52:17,416
DEFEND THIS FINE MAN ENOUGH.  

11330
05:52:17,416 --> 05:52:17,949
>> YOU ALSO HAVE NOW THE 

11331
05:52:17,949 --> 05:52:18,417
ABILITY OF WHICHEVER 

11332
05:52:18,417 --> 05:52:19,017
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO USE 

11333
05:52:19,017 --> 05:52:21,386
THEIR OWN TIME IN ADDITION TO 

11334
05:52:21,386 --> 05:52:23,922
DEALING WITH FLAKE AND SASS, 

11335
05:52:23,922 --> 05:52:26,191
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO 

11336
05:52:26,191 --> 05:52:28,693
EXACTLY WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

11337
05:52:28,693 --> 05:52:29,861
JUST DONE WITH DOCTOR FORD, 

11338
05:52:29,861 --> 05:52:32,264
WHICH IS TO BUILD UP THE PERSON 

11339
05:52:32,264 --> 05:52:35,067
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS AND HIS 

11340
05:52:35,067 --> 05:52:45,076
CREDIBILITY.  WHICH WAS 

11341
05:52:45,076 --> 05:52:45,677
SOMETHING THAT THE DEMOCRATS 

11342
05:52:45,677 --> 05:52:46,311
DID VERY WELL WITH DOCTOR FORD. 

11343
05:52:46,311 --> 05:52:46,878
>>  WE ARE EXPECTING THIS 

11344
05:52:46,878 --> 05:52:47,412
AFTERNOON A DRAMATICALLY 

11345
05:52:47,412 --> 05:52:48,079
DIFFERENT TONE FROM WHAT WE SAW 

11346
05:52:48,079 --> 05:52:48,446
THIS MORNING.  

11347
05:52:48,446 --> 05:52:49,080
THAT IS BASICALLY THE TALE OF 

11348
05:52:49,080 --> 05:52:50,782
TWO DAYS.  PRESUMABLY, THIS 

11349
05:52:50,782 --> 05:53:02,127
AFTERNOON.  AS WE WAIT FOR úBRE 

11350
05:53:02,127 --> 05:53:02,794
THE SENATE HEARING ROOM WE WILL 

11351
05:53:02,794 --> 05:53:03,395
GET AN OPENING STATEMENT FOR 

11352
05:53:03,395 --> 05:53:04,529
BRETT KAVANAUGH AS WELL.  úHE H 

11353
05:53:04,529 --> 05:53:05,130
GOING TO SAY ALREADY, AS DID 

11354
05:53:05,130 --> 05:53:05,630
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.  

11355
05:53:05,630 --> 05:53:08,433
WE WILL HAVE THE SAME 

11356
05:53:08,433 --> 05:53:10,035
QUESTIONING, IF NOT THE SAME 

11357
05:53:10,035 --> 05:53:11,503
TONE, THE SAME TIME ZIPPER 

11358
05:53:11,503 --> 05:53:14,907
QUESTIONING FROM DEMOCRATIC 

11359
05:53:14,907 --> 05:53:17,142
SENATORS AND REPUBLICAN 

11360
05:53:17,142 --> 05:53:17,642
SENATORS ON THE SENATE 

11361
05:53:17,642 --> 05:53:18,243
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THAT IS 

11362
05:53:18,243 --> 05:53:18,911
FIVE MINUTES APIECE.  

11363
05:53:18,911 --> 05:53:22,080
HOWEVER, MUCH REPUBLICANS THEN 

11364
05:53:22,080 --> 05:53:25,317
YIELD THEIR TIME TO THE 

11365
05:53:25,317 --> 05:53:25,917
PROSECUTOR, RACHEL MITCHELL, 

11366
05:53:25,917 --> 05:53:28,487
THE GUIDANCE FROM ED O

11367
05:53:28,487 --> 05:53:29,687
WHO IS JUST OUTSIDE THE HEARING 

11368
05:53:29,687 --> 05:53:31,522
ROOM IS THAT THEY WILL GIVE 

11369
05:53:31,522 --> 05:53:32,056
RACHEL MITCHELL ABOUT 20 

11370
05:53:32,056 --> 05:53:37,462
MINUTES TO QUESTION.  IS THAT 

11371
05:53:37,462 --> 05:53:38,062
THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT 

11372
05:53:38,062 --> 05:53:38,229
IT? 

11373
05:53:38,229 --> 05:53:39,031
RACHEL MITCHELL WILL BE 

11374
05:53:39,031 --> 05:53:40,999
QUESTIONING BRETT KAVANAUGH? 

11375
05:53:40,999 --> 05:53:41,266
>> YES.  

11376
05:53:41,266 --> 05:53:44,336
SHE IS GOING TO QUESTION HIM.  

11377
05:53:44,336 --> 05:53:44,870
BACK TO THIS CRAZY FIVE 

11378
05:53:44,870 --> 05:53:46,204
MINUTES, FIVE MINUTES, FIVE 

11379
05:53:46,204 --> 05:53:47,438
MINUTES.  AT LEAST I ASSUME YOU 

11380
05:53:47,438 --> 05:53:48,740
ARE.  

11381
05:53:48,740 --> 05:53:51,009
>> WHICH IS NOT INTERROGATING 

11382
05:53:51,009 --> 05:53:52,577
EXPECT IT GOES EVERY OTHER ONE. 

11383
05:53:52,577 --> 05:53:52,844
>> NO.  

11384
05:53:52,844 --> 05:53:55,013
SHE IS NOT INTERROGATING, SHE'S 

11385
05:53:55,013 --> 05:53:57,582
PROPPING HIM UP. 

11386
05:53:57,582 --> 05:53:58,383
>>  SHE COULD, DEPENDING ON HER 

11387
05:53:58,383 --> 05:54:02,587
ROLE, SHE COULD IN AN ODD WAY 

11388
05:54:02,587 --> 05:54:03,221
PLAY THE ROLE THAT DEMOCRATS 

11389
05:54:03,221 --> 05:54:03,855
WERE PLAYING THIS MORNING.  

11390
05:54:03,855 --> 05:54:04,388
WHEN THERE'S AGGRESSIVE 

11391
05:54:04,388 --> 05:54:07,859
QUESTIONING OR GENTLE 

11392
05:54:07,859 --> 05:54:08,493
QUESTIONING THE DEMOCRATS WERE 

11393
05:54:08,493 --> 05:54:09,194
ABLE TO STEP IN AND 

11394
05:54:09,194 --> 05:54:18,436
REHABILITATE OR ADD CHARACTER 

11395
05:54:18,436 --> 05:54:18,770
WITNESSES.  

11396
05:54:18,770 --> 05:54:19,337
SHE COULD PLAY THAT ROLE. 

11397
05:54:19,337 --> 05:54:19,704
>>  POSSIBLE.  

11398
05:54:19,704 --> 05:54:20,305
IT IS THE WHOLE QUESTION OF 

11399
05:54:20,305 --> 05:54:20,572
TIMING.  

11400
05:54:20,572 --> 05:54:21,707
IT IS JUST LIKE IN A COURT OF 

11401
05:54:21,707 --> 05:54:25,477
LAW WHEN SOMEBODY, WHEN I'M ON 

11402
05:54:25,477 --> 05:54:26,111
A ROLL AND SOMEBODY INTERRUPTS 

11403
05:54:26,111 --> 05:54:29,147
ME WITH AN OBJECTION IT WITH 

11404
05:54:29,147 --> 05:54:29,380
ROMY.  

11405
05:54:29,380 --> 05:54:31,516
AT LEAST I COULDN'T GET BACK SO 

11406
05:54:31,516 --> 05:54:32,718
QUICKLY ON THAT ROLE.  

11407
05:54:32,718 --> 05:54:38,523
HERE SHE MAY BE IN A POSITION, 

11408
05:54:38,523 --> 05:54:39,591
RACHEL MITCHELL, TO BE ABLE TO 

11409
05:54:39,591 --> 05:54:42,694
INTERRUPT THE DEMOCRATS FLOW IF 

11410
05:54:42,694 --> 05:54:45,998
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ANY 

11411
05:54:45,998 --> 05:54:46,531
CONTINUITY, IF THEY HAVE 

11412
05:54:46,531 --> 05:54:47,165
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING 

11413
05:54:47,165 --> 05:54:48,967
TO BUILD UPON EACH OTHER.  THAT 

11414
05:54:48,967 --> 05:54:49,267
MAY NOT.  

11415
05:54:49,267 --> 05:54:51,102
THEY MAY BE ALL IN THEIR LITTLE 

11416
05:54:51,102 --> 05:54:51,336
WORLD. 

11417
05:54:51,336 --> 05:54:54,105
>>  ALSO GIVE HIM A WAY TO PLAY 

11418
05:54:54,105 --> 05:55:00,912
CLEANUP.  

11419
05:55:00,912 --> 05:55:01,512
SHE COULD SAY DON'T YOU MEAN 

11420
05:55:01,512 --> 05:55:01,712
THIS? 

11421
05:55:01,712 --> 05:55:02,346
YOU HAVE A WITNESS THAT SAID 

11422
05:55:02,346 --> 05:55:04,816
THAT.  

11423
05:55:04,816 --> 05:55:05,450
WHATEVER PRESSURE POINTS THERE 

11424
05:55:05,450 --> 05:55:05,683
ARE -- 

11425
05:55:05,683 --> 05:55:06,918
>> SHE IS EXPERIENCED AT THAT.  

11426
05:55:06,918 --> 05:55:09,654
PROSECUTORS DO A LOT OF REDIRECT

11427
05:55:09,654 --> 05:55:09,988
EXAMINATION. 

11428
05:55:09,988 --> 05:55:11,623
>>  IT WOULD SEEM THE 

11429
05:55:11,623 --> 05:55:15,026
DEMOCRATIC GAME PLAN WAS EASY 

11430
05:55:15,026 --> 05:55:16,895
TO IDENTIFY THEY PRAISED FORD 

11431
05:55:16,895 --> 05:55:19,831
FOR BEING HEROIC AND THEY MADE 

11432
05:55:19,831 --> 05:55:20,465
A LOT OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION 

11433
05:55:20,465 --> 05:55:28,206
NOT TAKEN PLACE IN AN EFFORT TO 

11434
05:55:28,206 --> 05:55:28,840
SAY YOU MAY FIND GAPS IN HER 

11435
05:55:28,840 --> 05:55:29,441
STORY, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN 

11436
05:55:29,441 --> 05:55:30,108
SOLVED BY AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

11437
05:55:30,108 --> 05:55:31,009
EACH STATE ON THOSE TWO POINTS 

11438
05:55:31,009 --> 05:55:33,811
THROUGHOUT THEIR FIVE MINUTE A 

11439
05:55:33,811 --> 05:55:34,178
LOT OF TIME.  

11440
05:55:34,178 --> 05:55:35,247
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

11441
05:55:35,247 --> 05:55:39,484
WHAT REPUBLICANS, WHEN WE ARE

DOWN TO.  

11446
05:55:45,524 --> 05:55:46,158
IT IS BASICALLY YOU HAVE ABOUT 

11447
05:55:46,158 --> 05:55:46,691
TWOPOINT YOU CAN MAKE.  

11448

05:55:47,359 --> 05:55:49,961
GOING TO TAKE PLACE AROUND THIS 

11450
05:55:49,961 --> 05:55:50,528
AND WHAT WILL THAT BE FOR 

11451
05:55:50,528 --> 05:55:50,862
REPUBLICANS? 

11452
05:55:50,862 --> 05:55:52,964
>> IS THERE ANY DOUBT IN YOUR 

11453
05:55:52,964 --> 05:55:54,933
MIND THAT THE WHAT WILL HAPPEN 

11454
05:55:54,933 --> 05:56:03,175

05:56:09,580 --> 05:56:10,916
>> THEY HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING 

11463
05:56:10,916 --> 05:56:13,185
OTHERWISE.

11464
05:56:13,185 --> 05:56:15,520

11482
05:56:53,157 --> 05:56:53,824
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS CHARACTER.  

11483
05:56:53,824 --> 05:56:56,161
YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT HE HAS

WHICH FOR ALL INTENTS AND 

11490
05:57:10,542 --> 05:57:11,142
PURPOSES, SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN 

11491
05:57:11,142 --> 05:57:21,586
VERY, VERY GOOD IN THE POWERFUL 

11492
05:57:21,586 --> 05:57:22,153
COURT ON WHICH HE SERVED.  

11493
05:57:22,153 --> 05:57:22,753
YOU WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OF 

11494
05:57:22,753 --> 05:57:23,020
THAT.  

11495
05:57:23,020 --> 05:57:23,688
DOCTOR FORD IS NOT THE ONLY ONE 

11496
05:57:23,688 --> 05:57:24,055
WHO SUFFERED.  

11497
05:57:24,055 --> 05:57:24,689
THE KAVANAUGH'S ARE SUFFERING. 

11498
05:57:24,689 --> 05:57:26,824
>>  THIS REMINDS ME, THERE IS A 

11499
05:57:26,824 --> 05:57:27,893
MOMENT IN THE HEARING FOR 

11500
05:57:27,893 --> 05:57:29,494
JUSTICE SAM ALITO WHO IS 

11501
05:57:29,494 --> 05:57:30,595
REPLACING A KEY SWING VOTE AS 

11502
05:57:30,595 --> 05:57:34,566
WELL AND IT TURNED THE ENTIRE 

11503
05:57:34,566 --> 05:57:35,166
HEARING WHEN HE GOT FRIENDLY 

11504
05:57:35,166 --> 05:57:35,834
QUESTIONING FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM 

11505
05:57:35,834 --> 05:57:40,071
ABOUT HOW -- LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS 

11506
05:57:40,071 --> 05:57:40,705
AND YOU ARE NOT ABAD PERSON.  

11507
05:57:40,705 --> 05:57:41,339
YOU HAVE NEVER HAD ALLEGATIONS 

11508
05:57:41,339 --> 05:57:44,108
LIKE THIS AGAINST YOU.  

11509
05:57:44,108 --> 05:57:44,642
THE JUSTICES SAID NO.  

11510
05:57:44,642 --> 05:57:45,310
HIS WIFE STARTED CRYING AND RAN 

11511
05:57:45,310 --> 05:57:45,743
OUT OF THE ROOM.  

11512
05:57:45,743 --> 05:57:47,546
AT THAT MOMENT THE HEARING ROOM 

11513
05:57:47,546 --> 05:57:51,950
COMPLETELY CHANGED AND SAM 

11514
05:57:51,950 --> 05:57:52,483
ALITO WAS HEADED FOR THE 

11515
05:57:52,483 --> 05:57:53,151
SUPREME COURT PICK THAT WILL BE 

11516
05:57:53,151 --> 05:57:55,286
SOMETHING, THAT MOMENT -- BACK 

11517
05:57:55,286 --> 05:57:57,488
HAVING HIS FAMILY THERE I DO 

11518
05:57:57,488 --> 05:57:58,623
THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.  

11519
05:57:58,623 --> 05:58:00,725
I THINK THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED 

11520
05:58:00,725 --> 05:58:04,228
TO HIM IN THE PUBLIC EYE HAS 

11521
05:58:04,228 --> 05:58:15,707
ALSO HAPPENED TO HIS FAMILY.  

11522
05:58:15,707 --> 05:58:16,341
I THINK THAT THE SENATORS, WE 

11523
05:58:16,341 --> 05:58:16,941
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE CAMERA, 

11524
05:58:16,941 --> 05:58:17,575
BUT THE SENATORS WILL ALSO BE 

11525
05:58:17,575 --> 05:58:18,977
-- ALSO BE AWARE OF HOW THIS IS 

11526
05:58:18,977 --> 05:58:19,978
KAVANAUGH REACTS DURING THIS 

11527
05:58:19,978 --> 05:58:20,245
HEARING. 

11528
05:58:20,245 --> 05:58:22,781
>>  YOU MADE THIS POINT, THIS 

11529
05:58:22,781 --> 05:58:23,281
IS NO LONGER JUST A JOB 

11530
05:58:23,281 --> 05:58:23,581
INTERVIEW. 

11531
05:58:23,581 --> 05:58:27,018
>>  THAT'S RIGHT. 

11532
05:58:27,018 --> 05:58:28,920
>>  PUBLICANS WILL WANT TO 

11533
05:58:28,920 --> 05:58:29,521
REFRAME IT FROM BEING A JOB 

11534
05:58:29,521 --> 05:58:30,454
INTERVIEW TO GET A PROMOTION 

11535
05:58:30,454 --> 05:58:33,258
INTO IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR 

11536
05:58:33,258 --> 05:58:33,858
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IT WILL BE A 

11537
05:58:33,858 --> 05:58:34,759
PERMANENT VERDICT ON HIS 

11538
05:58:34,759 --> 05:58:36,294
CHARACTER, FOR HIS LIFE, AND 

11539
05:58:36,294 --> 05:58:38,797
FOR THE LIFE OF HIS FAMILY AND 

11540
05:58:38,797 --> 05:58:39,197
CHILDREN.  

11541
05:58:39,197 --> 05:58:40,265
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE 

11542
05:58:40,265 --> 05:58:45,804
CHOOSING TO DO -- RAISING THE 

11543
05:58:45,804 --> 05:58:46,471
EMOTIONAL STAKES FOR REPUBLICAN 

11544
05:58:46,471 --> 05:58:46,738
SENATORS. 

11545
05:58:46,738 --> 05:58:47,405
>>  THAT IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING 

11546
05:58:47,405 --> 05:58:49,274
TO HEAR WITH NO CORROBORATION, 

11547
05:58:49,274 --> 05:58:51,409
NO CONTEMPORANEOUS EVIDENCE, 

11548
05:58:51,409 --> 05:58:54,446
MULTIPLE INCONSISTENCIES, THIS 

11549
05:58:54,446 --> 05:58:58,016
IS ALL COOKED UP BY DEMOCRATS 

11550
05:58:58,016 --> 05:58:58,549
BECAUSE THEY SET ON THE 

11551
05:58:58,549 --> 05:59:01,887
ALLEGATION FOR TWO MONTHS.  

11552
05:59:01,887 --> 05:59:02,554
>> THEY SAID THEY SET ON THE 

11553
05:59:02,554 --> 05:59:03,855
ALLEGATION AT HER REQUEST.  

11554
05:59:03,855 --> 05:59:07,525
DOES THAT MATTER? 

11555
05:59:07,525 --> 05:59:08,159
>> WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO SAY 

11556
05:59:08,159 --> 05:59:08,692
AND WHAT WE ARE ALREADY 

11557
05:59:08,692 --> 05:59:09,326
STARTING TO HEAR IS THAT THEY 

11558
05:59:09,326 --> 05:59:09,860
COULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS 

11559
05:59:09,860 --> 05:59:14,232
FORWARD, EVEN HAD HER NAME 

11560
05:59:14,232 --> 05:59:14,699
REDACTED AND DONE IT 

11561
05:59:14,699 --> 05:59:15,366
ANONYMOUSLY SO IT DIDN'T EVEN 

11562
05:59:15,366 --> 05:59:17,469
HAVE TO BECOME PUBLIC.  

11563
05:59:17,469 --> 05:59:17,936
SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND 

11564
05:59:17,936 --> 05:59:21,772
REPRESENTATIVE AT NSU COULD 

11565
05:59:21,772 --> 05:59:22,406
HAVE COME FORWARD WITH THAT.  

11566
05:59:22,406 --> 05:59:23,441
THAT IS GOING TO BE PART OF 

11567
05:59:23,441 --> 05:59:25,343
THEIR NARRATIVE WE ALREADY SEE 

11568
05:59:25,343 --> 05:59:25,977
THEM COMING OUT TO SAY THIS.  

11569
05:59:25,977 --> 05:59:30,982
THAT DOCTOR FORD HAS MADE IT 

11570
05:59:30,982 --> 05:59:31,583
CLEAR THROUGHOUT THE MORNING 

11571
05:59:31,583 --> 05:59:32,250
SHE NEVER WANTED THIS TO BE A 

11572
05:59:32,250 --> 05:59:32,617
PUBLIC THING.  

11573
05:59:32,617 --> 05:59:33,318
SHE CAN BECAUSE THIS WAS HER 

11574
05:59:33,318 --> 05:59:36,554
CIVIC DUTY.  

11575
05:59:36,554 --> 05:59:37,188
>> SHE HOPED HE WOULD GET THE 

11576
05:59:37,188 --> 05:59:37,522
NOMINATION.  

11577
05:59:37,522 --> 05:59:38,223
SHE WANTED IT TO BE SOMEONE 

11578
05:59:38,223 --> 05:59:38,623
ELSE ENTIRELY.  

11579
05:59:38,623 --> 05:59:49,301
THAT'S WHY SHE 

11580
05:59:49,667 --> 05:59:49,934
A

11581
05:59:49,934 --> 05:59:51,369
LITTLE KID, WHEN YOU SEE

11582
05:59:51,369 --> 05:59:52,404
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WORKING IN

11583
05:59:52,404 --> 05:59:55,273
YOUR TOWN, CALL YOUR LOCAL

11584
05:59:55,273 --> 05:59:55,573
CONGRESSMAN.

11585
05:59:55,573 --> 05:59:56,374
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID.

11586
05:59:56,374 --> 05:59:57,609
>> AND THE TIPLINE.

11587
05:59:57,609 --> 06:00:01,079
>> THE ENCRYPTED TIP LINE WHERE

11588
06:00:01,079 --> 06:00:02,681
SHE REALLY COULD REMAIN WITH A

11589
06:00:02,681 --> 06:00:06,184
FEELING OF SAFETY OF

11590
06:00:06,184 --> 06:00:07,352
CONFIDENTIALITY.

11591
06:00:07,352 --> 06:00:07,852
I

11592
06:00:07,985 --> 06:00:08,119
. 

11593
06:00:08,119 --> 06:00:10,588
>>> I THINK BEAT KAVANAUGH IS 

11594
06:00:10,588 --> 06:00:11,088
IN A POSITION HERE. 

11595
06:00:11,088 --> 06:00:12,390
I'M WITH -- I DON'T KNOW IF I 

11596
06:00:12,390 --> 06:00:15,493
WERE HIM THAT I WOULD HAVE 

11597
06:00:15,493 --> 06:00:16,594
WATCHED ANY OF THAT. 

11598
06:00:16,594 --> 06:00:19,264
BECAUSE -- I THINK THAT IT 

11599
06:00:19,264 --> 06:00:20,598
WOULD EITHER ANGER ME IF I SAY 

11600
06:00:20,598 --> 06:00:23,401
I WASN'T THERE, I DIDN'T DO 

11601
06:00:23,401 --> 06:00:29,641
THIS, IT NEVER HAPPENED AND IT  

11602
06:00:29,641 --> 06:00:34,546
IS A SASS IS AN ASSASSINATION 

11603
06:00:34,546 --> 06:00:35,079
OF MY CHARACTER. 

11604
06:00:35,079 --> 06:00:36,247
>>  I STILL THINK YOU NEED TO 

11605
06:00:36,247 --> 06:00:37,682
KNOW WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS 

11606
06:00:37,682 --> 06:00:37,915
SAYING. 

11607
06:00:37,915 --> 06:00:38,549
>>  WE KNEW IT. 

11608
06:00:38,549 --> 06:00:41,352
>>  I WOULD WANT TO HEAR IT. 

11609
06:00:41,352 --> 06:00:42,687
HE WILL LIKELY BE ASKED THAT. 

11610
06:00:42,687 --> 06:00:43,854
IF HE WAS WATCHING. 

11611
06:00:43,854 --> 06:00:45,323
>>  OF COURSE. 

11612
06:00:45,323 --> 06:00:46,091
IT'S A BETTER. 

11613
06:00:46,091 --> 06:00:47,292
>>  WHAT HIS REACTION WAS. 

11614
06:00:47,292 --> 06:00:49,994
>>  IT'S A BETTER ANSWER TO SAY 

11615
06:00:49,994 --> 06:00:51,296
HE WATCHED IT AND WHATEVER HIS 

11616
06:00:51,296 --> 06:00:52,297
REACTION MAY HAVE BEEN. 

11617
06:00:52,297 --> 06:00:55,300
IT'S A BETTER ANSWER THAN 

11618
06:00:55,300 --> 06:00:57,568
SAYING I WASN'T GOING TO DO IT. 

11619
06:00:57,568 --> 06:00:58,870
>>  THERE'S NO COMPROMISE. 

11620
06:00:58,870 --> 06:01:00,404
IS HE ELEVATED OR HE ISN'T. 

11621
06:01:00,404 --> 06:01:01,706
>>  RIGHT AND HE WILL HAVE THE 

11622
06:01:01,706 --> 06:01:03,875
TAG WITH HIM FOR THE REST OF 

11623
06:01:03,875 --> 06:01:04,576
HIS LIFE, ELEVATED OR NOT. 

11624
06:01:04,576 --> 06:01:06,478
>> AND THERE ARE NO WINNERS 

11625
06:01:06,478 --> 06:01:06,678
HERE. 

11626
06:01:06,678 --> 06:01:10,115
WHETHER HE IS ELEVATED OR NOT 

11627
06:01:10,115 --> 06:01:10,515
HE DOESN'T WIN. 

11628
06:01:10,515 --> 06:01:11,115
SHEDOESN'T WIN. 

11629
06:01:11,115 --> 06:01:11,448
THE SUPREME. 

11630
06:01:11,448 --> 06:01:13,618
>>  THE FAMILIES DON'T WIN. 

11631
06:01:13,618 --> 06:01:15,487
>>  THERE IS -- IT'S -- THIS 

11632
06:01:15,487 --> 06:01:17,055
ENTIRE PROCESS IS -- THERE ARE 

11633
06:01:17,055 --> 06:01:17,422
NO WINNERS. 

11634
06:01:17,422 --> 06:01:20,725
>>  WHAT COULD HAVE MADE IT A 

11635
06:01:20,725 --> 06:01:21,158
WINNING SITUATION? 

11636
06:01:21,158 --> 06:01:22,727
WOULD THE FBI INVESTIGATION IN 

11637
06:01:22,727 --> 06:01:24,329
THE BEGINNING HAVE MADE THIS 

11638
06:01:24,329 --> 06:01:25,230
SEEM LIKE A FAIR SITUATION TO 

11639
06:01:25,230 --> 06:01:28,133
PEOPLE WHO WERE CALLING FOR IT 

11640
06:01:28,133 --> 06:01:29,233
FROM THE BEGINNING? 

11641
06:01:29,233 --> 06:01:31,436
I SAID EARLIER SHE WANTED AN 

11642
06:01:31,436 --> 06:01:32,604
FBI INVESTIGATION AND PEOPLE 

11643
06:01:32,604 --> 06:01:33,705
THAT HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE 

11644
06:01:33,705 --> 06:01:34,806
AREN'T SAYING PLEASE COME 

11645
06:01:34,806 --> 06:01:36,207
INVESTIGATE ME. 

11646
06:01:36,207 --> 06:01:36,841
>>  THE THING. 

11647
06:01:36,841 --> 06:01:38,810
WHEN THE COMMITTEE WAS AWARE OF 

11648
06:01:38,810 --> 06:01:41,913
THE ALLEGATIONS, ONLY A COUPLE 

11649
06:01:41,913 --> 06:01:42,213
WEEKS AGO. 

11650
06:01:42,213 --> 06:01:45,717
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN FBI 

11651
06:01:45,717 --> 06:01:47,018
INVESTIGATION WHERE THEY 

11652
06:01:47,018 --> 06:01:47,585
INTERVIEWED THE WITNESSES. 

11653
06:01:47,585 --> 06:01:48,520
THE SENATE -- ALL OF THESE 

11654
06:01:48,520 --> 06:01:49,320
STATEMENTS THEY ARE TAKING WITH 

11655
06:01:49,320 --> 06:01:50,921
THEIR INVESTIGATORS IS IN THE 

11656
06:01:50,921 --> 06:01:51,155
SENATE. 

11657
06:01:51,155 --> 06:01:52,523
THAT'S THE FORUM FOR IT. 

11658
06:01:52,523 --> 06:01:54,759
THOSE ARE PUNISHABLE AS A 

11659
06:01:54,759 --> 06:01:56,361
FELONY IF YOU LIE SO IT'S NO 

11660
06:01:56,361 --> 06:01:56,661
DIFFERENT. 

11661
06:01:56,661 --> 06:01:58,163
WE ARE GOING TO DO IT IN THE 

11662
06:01:58,163 --> 06:01:59,364
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE FBI 

11663
06:01:59,364 --> 06:02:00,165
INVESTIGATION PROCESS HAS ENDED 

11664
06:02:00,165 --> 06:02:02,367
AND THIS NEVER CAME UP BY THEN. 

11665
06:02:02,367 --> 06:02:03,100
I THINK. 

11666
06:02:03,100 --> 06:02:04,369
>>  SENATOR GRAHAM SAID WE 

11667
06:02:04,369 --> 06:02:06,371
COULD HAVE HAD AN INVESTIGATION 

11668
06:02:06,371 --> 06:02:08,039
IN THE LAST 11 DAYS. 

11669
06:02:08,039 --> 06:02:09,173
>>  THAT'S RIGHT. 

11670
06:02:09,173 --> 06:02:09,473
ABSOLUTELY. 

11671
06:02:09,473 --> 06:02:09,974
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. 

11672
06:02:09,974 --> 06:02:12,243
THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT IN THE 

11673
06:02:12,243 --> 06:02:12,576
HILL THOMAS. 

11674
06:02:12,576 --> 06:02:13,144
WHEN THEY REOPENED THAT. 

11675
06:02:13,144 --> 06:02:15,146
IT WAS A MATTER OF THREE DAYS 

11676
06:02:15,146 --> 06:02:16,047
THAT 2 TOOK THEM. 

11677
06:02:16,047 --> 06:02:17,082
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE ANSWERED 

11678
06:02:17,082 --> 06:02:17,949
ANYTHING IS MY POINT. 

11679
06:02:17,949 --> 06:02:19,951
THEY -- THE FBI JUST TAKES 

11680
06:02:19,951 --> 06:02:20,552
INTERVIEWS. 

11681
06:02:20,552 --> 06:02:23,488
>>  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 

11682
06:02:23,488 --> 06:02:25,323
OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION IN THE 

11683
06:02:25,323 --> 06:02:25,656
PUBLIC'S EYE. 

11684
06:02:25,656 --> 06:02:26,123
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. 

11685
06:02:26,123 --> 06:02:28,693
>>  MAYBE -- IT WOULD HAVE 

11686
06:02:28,693 --> 06:02:31,696
ROBBED A TALKING POINT THAT THE 

11687
06:02:31,696 --> 06:02:32,997
FBI -- POLITICALLY MAYBE IT WAS 

11688
06:02:32,997 --> 06:02:34,832
A BLUNDER BY REPUBLICAN IFS IT 

11689
06:02:34,832 --> 06:02:35,900
WOULD HAVE PROVIDE MORE 

11690
06:02:35,900 --> 06:02:36,233
INFORMATION. 

11691
06:02:36,233 --> 06:02:37,202
>>  AND PERHAPS THERE IS SOME 

11692
06:02:37,202 --> 06:02:38,303
CHANCE THEY MAY HAVE FOUND 

11693
06:02:38,303 --> 06:02:40,071
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE -- 

11694
06:02:40,071 --> 06:02:41,639
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT 

11695
06:02:41,639 --> 06:02:41,905
CLEARER. 

11696
06:02:41,905 --> 06:02:43,174
>>  IT MAY HAVE CLEARED HIM. 

11697
06:02:43,174 --> 06:02:45,176
>>  INDEED AND SOME HAVE ARGUED 

11698
06:02:45,176 --> 06:02:47,045
THAT WOULD BE -- THAT HE -- 

11699
06:02:47,045 --> 06:02:47,879
THERE SHOULD BE AN 

11700
06:02:47,879 --> 06:02:49,647
INVESTIGATION FOR THE PURPOSES 

11701
06:02:49,647 --> 06:02:50,148
OF CLEARING HIM. 

11702
06:02:50,148 --> 06:02:51,850
I THINK IN YOUR QUESTION WHICH 

11703
06:02:51,850 --> 06:02:53,184
IS COULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER. 

11704
06:02:53,184 --> 06:02:55,553
IN THIS IS THAT THIS IS REALLY 

11705
06:02:55,553 --> 06:02:57,689
NOT THE BEST VENUE TO WORK WITH 

11706
06:02:57,689 --> 06:03:01,226
THE TRICKIEST QUESTIONS IN THE 

11707
06:03:01,226 --> 06:03:06,898
CULTURE THAT ARE IN ALL PARTS 

11708
06:03:06,898 --> 06:03:07,331
OF THE CULTURE. 

11709
06:03:07,331 --> 06:03:09,701
THIS IS NOT THE BEST PLACE TO 

11710
06:03:09,701 --> 06:03:10,902
UNWIND THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE 

11711
06:03:10,902 --> 06:03:12,169
WE HAVE YET TO FIND A BEST 

11712
06:03:12,169 --> 06:03:12,569
PLACE FOR THAT. 

11713
06:03:12,569 --> 06:03:15,006
>>  HOW MUCH WE HAVE LEARNED 

11714
06:03:15,006 --> 06:03:17,776
THAT WE DIDN'T IN 1991 AND NOW 

11715
06:03:17,776 --> 06:03:19,377
DOING IT ALL OVER AGAIN IN THE 

11716
06:03:19,377 --> 06:03:21,346
SAME WAY AND TO YOUR POINT THAT 

11717
06:03:21,346 --> 06:03:22,580
IT NOT BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE 

11718
06:03:22,580 --> 06:03:25,450
WAY TO DO IT BUT IT IS -- HOW 

11719
06:03:25,450 --> 06:03:25,817
IT'S HAPPENING. 

11720
06:03:25,817 --> 06:03:27,018
>>  YEAH. 

11721
06:03:27,018 --> 06:03:29,253
>>  RIGHT NOW. 

11722
06:03:29,253 --> 06:03:33,625
>>  WE SEE THE CHAIRMAN, 

11723
06:03:33,625 --> 06:03:34,092
REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN. 

11724
06:03:34,092 --> 06:03:34,692
>>  THERE'S LINDSEY GRAHAM. 

11725
06:03:34,692 --> 06:03:37,895
>>  HE SAID HE FEELS AMBUSHED 

11726
06:03:37,895 --> 06:03:38,495
BY THE PROCESS. 

11727
06:03:38,495 --> 06:03:40,531
ORRIN HATCH YOU SEE THERE. 

11728
06:03:40,531 --> 06:03:43,902
SENATORS MAKING THEIR WAY BACK 

11729
06:03:43,902 --> 06:03:44,202
IN. 

11730
06:03:44,202 --> 06:03:48,172
THERE IS -- YOUR -- REPUBLICAN 

11731
06:03:48,172 --> 06:03:50,909
PICKED QUESTIONER RACHEL 

11732
06:03:50,909 --> 06:03:54,044
MITCHELL ON HER WAY BACK IN. 

11733
06:03:54,044 --> 06:03:55,980
JOHN KENNEDY TO THE ROOM. 

11734
06:03:55,980 --> 06:03:57,582
JOHN CORIN WHO WE HEARD. 

11735
06:03:57,582 --> 06:04:02,253
HIS WORDS WERE I WOULD SAY MORE 

11736
06:04:02,253 --> 06:04:03,621
MEASURED THAN LINDSEY GRAHAM'S 

11737
06:04:03,621 --> 06:04:03,888
WERE. 

11738
06:04:03,888 --> 06:04:05,123
GRAHAM HAD SOME VERY STRONG 

11739
06:04:05,123 --> 06:04:07,191
OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT IS TAKING 

11740
06:04:07,191 --> 06:04:07,992
PLACE SO FAR. 

11741
06:04:07,992 --> 06:04:12,797
YOU SEE TED CRUZ, BEN SASS, SO, 

11742
06:04:12,797 --> 06:04:13,564
ALL SENATORS, JEFF FLAKE. 

11743
06:04:13,564 --> 06:04:15,733
AGAIN -- YOU JUST SAW A FEW OF 

11744
06:04:15,733 --> 06:04:18,002
THE SENATORS WHO YOU WILL BE 

11745
06:04:18,002 --> 06:04:19,003
WATCHING VERY CLOSELY, NOT JUST 

11746
06:04:19,003 --> 06:04:21,873
THIS AFTERNOON BUT IN THE NEXT 

11747
06:04:21,873 --> 06:04:24,341
FEW DAYS AS WE FIGURE OUT 

11748
06:04:24,341 --> 06:04:26,377
WHETHER THIS FIRST VOTE -- WHAT 

11749
06:04:26,377 --> 06:04:28,780
HAPPENS THIS AFTERNOON, WHETHER 

11750
06:04:28,780 --> 06:04:30,882
A VOTE HAPPENS TOMORROW AND 

11751
06:04:30,882 --> 06:04:33,852
THEN WHETHER ONE TAKES PLACE 

11752
06:04:33,852 --> 06:04:36,588
AFTER THAT EARLY NEXT WEEK 

11753
06:04:36,588 --> 06:04:37,922
REGARDING BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 

11754
06:04:37,922 --> 06:04:38,957
THE SUPREME COURT. 

11755
06:04:38,957 --> 06:04:42,627
THEY TOOK A BREAK NOW. 

11756
06:04:42,627 --> 06:04:48,533
THEY SAID IT WOULD BE A 45 

11757
06:04:48,533 --> 06:04:51,336
MINUTE BREAK BETWEEN WHEN FORD 

11758
06:04:51,336 --> 06:04:52,904
TESTIFIED AND WHEN BRETT 

11759
06:04:52,904 --> 06:04:53,371
KAVANAUGH TESTIFIED. 

11760
06:04:53,371 --> 06:04:54,973
ITS BEEN A LITTLE MORE THAN 

11761
06:04:54,973 --> 06:04:55,373
THAT 45 MINUTES. 

11762
06:04:55,373 --> 06:04:56,908
WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE 

11763
06:04:56,908 --> 06:04:58,276
QUESTION OF IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

11764
06:04:58,276 --> 06:04:59,810
HAD BEEN WATCHING SOME OF THIS 

11765
06:04:59,810 --> 06:05:00,110
TESTIMONY. 

11766
06:05:00,110 --> 06:05:01,779
WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 

11767
06:05:01,779 --> 06:05:01,979
THAT. 

11768
06:05:01,979 --> 06:05:03,982
WE KNOW THAT DURING PART OF HIS 

11769
06:05:03,982 --> 06:05:06,384
TIME HE WAS OBVIOUSLY MAKING 

11770
06:05:06,384 --> 06:05:09,887
HIS WAY FROM HIS HOME TO THE 

11771
06:05:09,887 --> 06:05:10,287
HEARING ITSELF. 

11772
06:05:10,287 --> 06:05:12,623
WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT THE 

11773
06:05:12,623 --> 06:05:17,328
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WATCHING 

11774
06:05:17,328 --> 06:05:18,329
THIS HEARING. 

11775
06:05:18,329 --> 06:05:19,530
HE ALSO WAS IN TRANSIT HEADING 

11776
06:05:19,530 --> 06:05:23,034
TO DC FROM NEW YORK WHERE HE 

11777
06:05:23,034 --> 06:05:26,069
WAS FOR THE UN MEETINGS. 

11778
06:05:26,069 --> 06:05:27,605
THE FOLKS INVOLVED IN THIS AS 

11779
06:05:27,605 --> 06:05:29,407
WELL AS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 

11780
06:05:29,407 --> 06:05:31,209
ARE WATCHING EVERYTHING THAT 

11781
06:05:31,209 --> 06:05:33,311
HAS BEEN HAPPENING HERE SO 

11782
06:05:33,311 --> 06:05:35,413
CLOSELY TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE 

11783
06:05:35,413 --> 06:05:36,781
TO WATCH THIS AFTERNOON AS WE 

11784
06:05:36,781 --> 06:05:38,649
JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT 

11785
06:05:38,649 --> 06:05:40,284
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THIS 

11786
06:05:40,284 --> 06:05:40,584
AFTERNOON. 

11787
06:05:40,584 --> 06:05:42,921
>>  WE DON'T. 

11788
06:05:42,921 --> 06:05:44,555
I MEAN WE CAN ANTICIPATE AS 

11789
06:05:44,555 --> 06:05:51,695
MUCH AS WE CAN THAT YOU ARE 

11790
06:05:51,695 --> 06:05:59,003
GOING TO SEE TO SEE YOU A 

11791
06:05:59,003 --> 06:06:05,443

DOESN'T BELIEVE SHE EVER SAW ME 

11923
06:11:13,484 --> 06:11:14,585

KNOW MR. KAVANAUGH. 

11928
06:11:23,961 --> 06:11:25,029

11930

END QUOTE. 

11933
06:11:37,407 --> 06:11:38,375
THINK ABOUT THAT FACT. 

11934
06:11:38,375 --> 06:11:41,178
THE DAY AFTER THE ALLEGATION 

11935
06:11:41,178 --> 06:11:43,214

11968
06:12:59,256 --> 06:13:00,858
GROWN UP WITH AND WORKED WITH 

11969
06:13:00,858 --> 06:13:03,027
AND PLAYED WITH AND COACHED 

11970
06:13:03,027 --> 06:13:04,662
WITH AND DATED AND TAUGHT AND 

11971
06:13:04,662 --> 06:13:08,866
GONE TO GAMES WITH AND HAD 

11972
06:13:08,866 --> 06:13:09,366
BEERS WITH. 

11973
06:13:09,366 --> 06:13:11,836
LISTEN TO THE WITNESSES WHO 

11974
06:13:11,836 --> 06:13:15,439
ALLEGEDLY WERE AT THIS EVENT 36 

11975
06:13:15,439 --> 06:13:20,544
YEARS AGO. 

11976
06:13:20,544 --> 06:13:23,280
LISTEN TO MISS KAISER. 

11977
06:13:23,280 --> 06:13:24,080
SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME. 

11978
06:13:24,080 --> 06:13:28,319
I WAS NOT AT THE PART DESCRIBED 

11979
06:13:28,319 --> 06:13:31,455
BY DR. FORD THIS PROCESS HAS 

11980
06:13:31,455 --> 06:13:32,722
BECOME A NATIONAL DISGRACE. 

11981
06:13:32,722 --> 06:13:33,557
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE 

11982
06:13:33,557 --> 06:13:37,862
SENATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE 

11983
06:13:37,862 --> 06:13:38,329
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 

11984
06:13:38,329 --> 06:13:41,532
YOU HAVE REPLACED ADVICE AND 

11985
06:13:41,532 --> 06:13:44,768
CONSENT WITH SEARCH AND 

11986
06:13:44,768 --> 06:13:45,035
DESTROY. 

11987
06:13:45,035 --> 06:13:46,337
SINCE MY NOMINATION IN JULY 

11988
06:13:46,337 --> 06:13:47,972
THERE HAS BEEN A FRENZY ON THE 

11989
06:13:47,972 --> 06:13:52,910
LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING, 

11990
06:13:52,910 --> 06:13:54,111
ANYTHING TO BLOCK MY 

11991
06:13:54,111 --> 06:13:54,444
CONFIRMATION. 

11992
06:13:54,444 --> 06:13:56,514
SHORTLY AFTER I WAS NOMINATED 

11993
06:13:56,514 --> 06:14:02,920
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE LEADER 

11994
06:14:02,920 --> 06:14:05,589
SAID HE WOULDO MOSE WOULD 

11995
06:14:05,589 --> 06:14:07,024
OPPOSE ME WITH EVERYTHING HE 

11996
06:14:07,024 --> 06:14:09,960
HAS, ANOTHER DEMOCRAT REFERRED 

11997
06:14:09,960 --> 06:14:11,695
TO ME AS EVIL, EVIL. 

11998
06:14:11,695 --> 06:14:13,664
THINK ABOUT THAT WORD AND SAID 

11999
06:14:13,664 --> 06:14:22,907
THOSE WHO SUPPORTED ME WERE  

12000
06:14:22,907 --> 06:14:24,241
COMPLICIT IN EVIL. 

12001
06:14:24,241 --> 06:14:25,342
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SAID 

12002
06:14:25,342 --> 06:14:26,644
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS YOUR WORST 

12003
06:14:26,644 --> 06:14:27,011
NIGHTMARE. 

12004
06:14:27,011 --> 06:14:30,948
A FORMER HEAD OF THE DNC SAID 

12005
06:14:30,948 --> 06:14:32,950
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL THREATEN 

12006
06:14:32,950 --> 06:14:37,788
THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF 

12007
06:14:37,788 --> 06:14:39,890
AMERICANS FOR DECADES TO COME. 

12008
06:14:39,890 --> 06:14:41,959
I UNDERSTAND THE PASSIONS OF 

12009
06:14:41,959 --> 06:14:45,396
THE MOMENT BUT I WOULD SAY TO 

12010
06:14:45,396 --> 06:14:49,800
THOSE SENATORS YOUR WORDS HAVE  

12011
06:14:49,800 --> 06:14:50,801
MEANING. 

12012
06:14:50,801 --> 06:14:54,271
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LISTENED 

12013
06:14:54,271 --> 06:14:55,139
CAREFULLY TO YOU. 

12014
06:14:55,139 --> 06:14:57,341
GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE THOSE IS IT 

12015
06:14:57,341 --> 06:15:00,144
ANY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

12016
06:15:00,144 --> 06:15:02,446
BEEN WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO 

12017
06:15:02,446 --> 06:15:04,849
MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT 

12018
06:15:04,849 --> 06:15:05,582
AGAINST MY FAMILY? 

12019
06:15:05,582 --> 06:15:08,452
TO SEND ANY VIOLENT E-MAIL TO 

12020
06:15:08,452 --> 06:15:09,853
MY WIFE? 

12021
06:15:09,853 --> 06:15:13,591
TO MAKE ANY KIND OF ALLEGATION 

12022
06:15:13,591 --> 06:15:15,593
AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY 

12023
06:15:15,593 --> 06:15:15,860
FRIENDS? 

12024
06:15:15,860 --> 06:15:20,798
TO BLOW ME UP AND TAKE ME DOWN? 

12025
06:15:20,798 --> 06:15:22,766
YOU SOWED THE WIND, FOR DECADES 

12026
06:15:22,766 --> 06:15:25,202
TO COME I FEAR THAT THE WHOLE 

12027
06:15:25,202 --> 06:15:28,672
COUNTRY WILL REAP THE 

12028
06:15:28,672 --> 06:15:28,972
WHIRLWIND. 

12029
06:15:28,972 --> 06:15:31,342
THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL OF THE 

12030
06:15:31,342 --> 06:15:33,577
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THIS 

12031
06:15:33,577 --> 06:15:39,016
COMMITTEE AT MY HEARING A FEW 

12032
06:15:39,016 --> 06:15:41,819
WEEKS AGO AS AN EMBARRASSMENT. 

12033
06:15:41,819 --> 06:15:43,554
THOSE EFFORTS DIDN'T WORK. 

12034
06:15:43,554 --> 06:15:45,990
WHEN I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH 

12035
06:15:45,990 --> 06:15:47,591
AT THE HEARINGS THAT IT LOOKED 

12036
06:15:47,591 --> 06:15:51,095
LIKE I MAY GET CONFIRMED A NEW 

12037
06:15:51,095 --> 06:15:52,028
TACTIC WAS NEEDED. 

12038
06:15:52,028 --> 06:15:56,901
SOME OF YOU WERE LYING IN 

12039
06:15:56,901 --> 06:15:58,001
WEIGHT AND HAD IT READY. 

12040
06:15:58,001 --> 06:15:59,570
THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD 

12041
06:15:59,570 --> 06:16:00,938
IN SECURITY FOR WEEKS BY A 

12042
06:16:00,938 --> 06:16:02,840
DEMOCRAT MEMBER OF THIS 

12043
06:16:02,840 --> 06:16:03,673
COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF. 

12044
06:16:03,673 --> 06:16:05,075
IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU 

12045
06:16:05,075 --> 06:16:09,046
COULDN'T TAKE ME OUT ON THE 

12046
06:16:09,046 --> 06:16:09,580
MERITS. 

12047
06:16:09,580 --> 06:16:13,050
WHEN IT WAS NEEDED THIS 

12048
06:16:13,050 --> 06:16:14,617
ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND 

12049
06:16:14,617 --> 06:16:20,691
PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER DR. 

12050
06:16:20,691 --> 06:16:21,058
FORD'S WISHES. 

12051
06:16:21,058 --> 06:16:27,798
THEN, AND THEN  AS WAS NO DOUBT 

12052
06:16:27,798 --> 06:16:29,099
EXPECTED IF NOT PLANNED CAME A 

12053
06:16:29,099 --> 06:16:30,801
LONG SERIES OF LAST MINUTE 

12054
06:16:30,801 --> 06:16:31,769
SMEARS DESIGNED TO SCARE ME AND 

12055
06:16:31,769 --> 06:16:40,377
DRIVE ME OUT OF THE PROCESS 

12056
06:16:40,377 --> 06:16:41,578
BEFORE ANY HEARING HAPPENED. 

12057
06:16:41,578 --> 06:16:44,548
CRAZY STUFF, GANGS, FIGHTS ON 

12058
06:16:44,548 --> 06:16:46,917
BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND, 

12059
06:16:46,917 --> 06:16:53,490
CHILDREN, ALL NONE SENSE, 

12060
06:16:53,490 --> 06:16:55,292
REPORTED BREATHLESSLY BY THE 

12061
06:16:55,292 --> 06:16:55,525
MEDIA. 

12062
06:16:55,525 --> 06:16:56,994
THIS HAS DESTROYED MY FAMILY 

12063
06:16:56,994 --> 06:16:57,795
AND MY GOOD NAME. 

12064
06:16:57,795 --> 06:16:59,596
A GOOD NAME BUILT UP THROUGH 

12065
06:16:59,596 --> 06:17:01,198
DECADES OF HARD WORK AND PUBLIC 

12066
06:17:01,198 --> 06:17:06,170
SERVICE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS 

12067
06:17:06,170 --> 06:17:06,770
OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. 

12068
06:17:06,770 --> 06:17:11,475
THIS WHOLE TWO WEEK EFFORT HAS 

12069
06:17:11,475 --> 06:17:12,876
BEEN A CALCULATED AND 

12070
06:17:12,876 --> 06:17:14,078
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT 

12071
06:17:14,078 --> 06:17:18,382
FUELED WITH PENT UP ANGER ABOUT 

12072
06:17:18,382 --> 06:17:21,185
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 2016 

12073
06:17:21,185 --> 06:17:24,187
ELECTION, FEAR THAT HAS BEEN 

12074
06:17:24,187 --> 06:17:25,022
UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT MY 

12075
06:17:25,022 --> 06:17:27,725
RECORD, REVENGE ON BEHALF OF 

12076
06:17:27,725 --> 06:17:30,294
THE  CLINTONS, AND MILLIONS OF 

12077
06:17:30,294 --> 06:17:34,898
DOLLARS IN MONEY FROM OUTSIDE 

12078
06:17:34,898 --> 06:17:37,835
LEFT WING OPPOSITION GROUPS. 

12079
06:17:37,835 --> 06:17:38,935
THIS IS A CIRCUS. 

12080
06:17:38,935 --> 06:17:41,772
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND 

12081
06:17:41,772 --> 06:17:42,572
LONG PAST MY NOMINATION. 

12082
06:17:42,572 --> 06:17:47,478
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH 

12083
06:17:47,478 --> 06:17:49,279
US FOR DECADES. 

12084
06:17:49,279 --> 06:17:53,584
THIS GROTESQUE AND COORDINATED 

12085
06:17:53,584 --> 06:17:54,852
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WILL 

12086
06:17:54,852 --> 06:17:59,890
DISSU ADE GOOD PEOPLE OF ALL 

12087
06:17:59,890 --> 06:18:00,624
POLITICAL AREAS SERVING OUR 

12088
06:18:00,624 --> 06:18:03,026
COUNTRY AND AS WE KNOW IN THE 

12089
06:18:03,026 --> 06:18:04,528
POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE EARLY 

12090
06:18:04,528 --> 06:18:09,933
2,000'S WHAT GOES AROUND COMES 

12091
06:18:09,933 --> 06:18:10,200
AROUND. 

12092
06:18:10,200 --> 06:18:10,800
I AM AN OPTIMISTIC GUY. 

12093
06:18:10,800 --> 06:18:13,470
I ALWAYS TRY TO BE ON THE 

12094
06:18:13,470 --> 06:18:14,837
SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. 

12095
06:18:14,837 --> 06:18:19,376
TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DAY 

12096
06:18:19,376 --> 06:18:20,077
THAT IS COMING. 

12097
06:18:20,077 --> 06:18:23,981
TODAY, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I 

12098
06:18:23,981 --> 06:18:25,615
FEAR FOR THE FUTURE. 

12099
06:18:25,615 --> 06:18:28,085
LAST TIME I WAS HERE I TOLD 

12100
06:18:28,085 --> 06:18:30,587
THIS COMMITTEE THAT A JUDGE 

12101
06:18:30,587 --> 06:18:32,823
MUST BE INDEPENDENT, NOT SWAYED 

12102
06:18:32,823 --> 06:18:33,623
BY PUBLIC OR POLITICAL 

12103
06:18:33,623 --> 06:18:34,424
PRESSURE. 

12104
06:18:34,424 --> 06:18:39,029
I SAID I WAS SUCH A JUDGE AND I 

12105
06:18:39,029 --> 06:18:39,195
AM. 

12106
06:18:39,195 --> 06:18:42,099
I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED INTO 

12107
06:18:42,099 --> 06:18:43,801
WITHDRAWING FROM THIS PROCESS. 

12108
06:18:43,801 --> 06:18:47,471
YOU HAVE TRIED HARD. 

12109
06:18:47,471 --> 06:18:51,275
YOU HAVE GIVEN IT YOUR ALL. 

12110
06:18:51,275 --> 06:18:53,077
YOUR COORDINATE AND WELL FUNDED 

12111
06:18:53,077 --> 06:18:55,378
EFFORT TO DESTROY MY GOOD NAME 

12112
06:18:55,378 --> 06:19:00,083
AND DESTROY MY FAMILY WILL NOT 

12113
06:19:00,083 --> 06:19:01,485
DRIVE ME OUT. 

12114
06:19:01,485 --> 06:19:02,619
THE VILE THREATS OF VIOLENCE 

12115
06:19:02,619 --> 06:19:04,088
AGAINST MY FAMILY WILL NOT 

12116
06:19:04,088 --> 06:19:04,755
DRIVE ME OUT. 

12117
06:19:04,755 --> 06:19:06,723
YOU MAY DEFEAT ME IN THE FINAL 

12118
06:19:06,723 --> 06:19:12,529
VOTE BUT YOU WILL NEVER GET ME 

12119
06:19:12,529 --> 06:19:12,796
TO QUIT. 

12120
06:19:12,796 --> 06:19:13,430
NEVER. 

12121
06:19:13,430 --> 06:19:16,834
I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL THE 

12122
06:19:16,834 --> 06:19:17,067
TRUTH. 

12123
06:19:17,067 --> 06:19:20,804
I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 

12124
06:19:20,804 --> 06:19:21,037
ANYONE. 

12125
06:19:21,037 --> 06:19:24,908
NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT IN 

12126
06:19:24,908 --> 06:19:26,877
COLLEGE, NOT EVER. 

12127
06:19:26,877 --> 06:19:28,544
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS HORRIFIC. 

12128
06:19:28,544 --> 06:19:29,513
ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS TO 

12129
06:19:29,513 --> 06:19:31,748
THIS DAY IS A WOMAN WHO WAS 

12130
06:19:31,748 --> 06:19:33,617
SEXUALLY ABUSED AND WHO IN THE 

12131
06:19:33,617 --> 06:19:35,786
90s WHEN WE WERE IN OUR 30s 

12132
06:19:35,786 --> 06:19:39,556
CONFIDED IN ME ABOUT THE ABUSE. 

12133
06:19:39,556 --> 06:19:40,324
SHE SOUGHT MY ADVICE. 

12134
06:19:40,324 --> 06:19:45,429
I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE 

12135
06:19:45,429 --> 06:19:45,796
SHE CONSULTED. 

12136
06:19:45,796 --> 06:19:48,832
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

12137
06:19:48,832 --> 06:19:51,234
MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, 

12138
06:19:51,234 --> 06:19:51,467
ALWAYS. 

12139
06:19:51,467 --> 06:19:54,905
THOSE WHO MAKE ALLEGATIONS 

12140
06:19:54,905 --> 06:19:56,106
ALWAYS DESERVE TO BE HEARD. 

12141
06:19:56,106 --> 06:19:58,709
AT THE SAME TIME THE PERSON WHO 

12142
06:19:58,709 --> 06:20:01,812
IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

06:27:03,033 --> 06:27:03,466
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 

12319
06:27:03,466 --> 06:27:03,700
NOBODY. 

12320
06:27:03,700 --> 06:27:03,900
EVER. 

12321
06:27:03,900 --> 06:27:05,535
A LIFETIME, A LIFETIME OF 

12322
06:27:05,535 --> 06:27:07,804
PUBLIC SERVICE AND A LIFETIME 

12323
06:27:07,804 --> 06:27:10,240
OF HIGH PROFILE PUBLIC SERVICE 

12324
06:27:10,240 --> 06:27:12,809
AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 

12325
06:27:12,809 --> 06:27:13,276
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. 

12326
06:27:13,276 --> 06:27:16,413
NEVER A HINT OF ANYTHING OF 

12327
06:27:16,413 --> 06:27:16,813
THIS KIND. 

12328
06:27:16,813 --> 06:27:25,989
THAT'S BECAUSE NOTHING OF THIS 

12329
06:27:25,989 --> 06:27:29,024
KIND EVER HAPPENED. 

12330
06:27:29,024 --> 06:27:32,662
SECOND, LET'S TURN TO 

12331
06:27:32,662 --> 06:27:32,962
SPECIFICS. 

12332
06:27:32,962 --> 06:27:34,931
I DENY THE ALLEGATION AGAINST 

12333
06:27:34,931 --> 06:27:36,366
ME BY DR. FORD. 

12334
06:27:36,366 --> 06:27:38,034
I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL OR 

12335
06:27:38,034 --> 06:27:40,603
PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER OF ANY KIND 

12336
06:27:40,603 --> 06:27:41,504
WITH DR. FORD. 

12337
06:27:41,504 --> 06:27:43,606
I NEVER ATTENDED A GATHERING 

12338
06:27:43,606 --> 06:27:47,811
LIKE THE ONE DR. FORD DESCRIBED 

12339
06:27:47,811 --> 06:27:49,946
IN HER ALLEGATIONS. 

12340
06:27:49,946 --> 06:27:53,216
I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED DR. 

12341
06:27:53,216 --> 06:27:54,150
FORD OR ANYONE. 

12342
06:27:54,150 --> 06:27:55,986
AGAIN, I AM NOT QUESTIONING 

12343
06:27:55,986 --> 06:27:59,456
THAT DR. FORD MAY HAVE BEEN 

12344
06:27:59,456 --> 06:28:03,026
ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON IN 

12345
06:28:03,026 --> 06:28:03,559
SOMEPLACE AT SOME TIME. 

12346
06:28:03,559 --> 06:28:09,733
I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT TO HER 

12347
06:28:09,733 --> 06:28:10,199
OR TO ANYONE. 

12348
06:28:10,199 --> 06:28:11,067
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS STEMS 

12349
06:28:11,067 --> 06:28:14,904
FROM A PARTY THAT SHE ALLEGES 

12350
06:28:14,904 --> 06:28:18,908
HAPPENED DURING THE SUMMER OF 

12351
06:28:18,908 --> 06:28:19,109
1982. 

12352
06:28:19,109 --> 06:28:21,311
36 YEARS AGO. 

12353
06:28:21,311 --> 06:28:22,712
I WAS 17 YEARS OLD. 

12354
06:28:22,712 --> 06:28:24,347

12355
06:28:24,347 --> 06:28:29,319

MARYLAND. 

12360
06:28:35,425 --> 06:28:37,060
WHEN MY FRIENDS AND I SPENT 

12361
06:28:37,060 --> 06:28:38,561
TIME TOGETHER AT PARTIES ON 

12362
06:28:38,561 --> 06:28:41,464
WEEKENDS IT WAS USUALLY WITH 

12363
06:28:41,464 --> 06:28:42,932

12366
06:28:50,173 --> 06:28:50,473
HOLY CROSS. 

12367
06:28:50,473 --> 06:28:54,411
DR. FORD DID NOT ATTEND ANY OF 

12368
06:28:54,411 --> 06:28:55,411
THOSE SCHOOLS. 

12369
06:28:55,411 --> 06:28:57,447
SHE ATTENDED AN INDEPENDENT 

12370
06:28:57,447 --> 06:28:58,147
PRIVATE SCHOOL NAMED HOLTON 

12371
06:28:58,147 --> 06:29:00,383
ARMS AND SHE WAS A YEAR BEHIND 

12372
06:29:00,383 --> 06:29:00,549
ME. 

12373
06:29:00,549 --> 06:29:03,119
SHE AND I DID NOT TRAVEL IN THE 

12374
06:29:03,119 --> 06:29:03,619
SAME SOCIAL CIRCLES. 

12375
06:29:03,619 --> 06:29:06,656
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MET AT 

12376
06:29:06,656 --> 06:29:08,692
SOME POINT AT SOME EVENTS 

12377
06:29:08,692 --> 06:29:12,294
THOUGH I DO NOT RECALL THAT. 

12378
06:29:12,294 --> 06:29:14,164
TO REPEAT, ALL OF THE PEOPLE 

12379
06:29:14,164 --> 06:29:15,865
IDENTIFIED BY DR. FORD AS BEING 

12380
06:29:15,865 --> 06:29:18,268
PRESENT AT THE PARTY HAVE SAID 

12381
06:29:18,268 --> 06:29:23,239
THEY DO NOT REMEMBER ANY SUCH 

12382
06:29:23,239 --> 06:29:24,941
PARTY EVER HAPPENING. 

12383
06:29:24,941 --> 06:29:25,642
IMPORTANTLY HER FRIEND MISS 

12384
06:29:25,642 --> 06:29:28,144
KAISER HAS DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF 

12385
06:29:28,144 --> 06:29:30,213
THE PARTY, SHE HAS SAID UNDER 

12386
06:29:30,213 --> 06:29:33,049
PENALTY OF FELONY THAT SHE DOES 

12387
06:29:33,049 --> 06:29:34,951
NOT KNOW ME, DOES NOT RECALL 

12388
06:29:34,951 --> 06:29:39,355
EVER BEING AT A PARTY WITH ME, 

12389
06:29:39,355 --> 06:29:39,656
EVER. 

12390
06:29:39,656 --> 06:29:41,691
MY TWO MALE FRIENDS WHO WERE 

12391
06:29:41,691 --> 06:29:43,259
ALLEGEDLY THERE, WHO KNEW ME 

12392

WELL, HAVE TOLD THIS COMMITTEE 

12393
06:29:45,395 --> 06:29:46,863
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY THAT 

12394
06:29:46,863 --> 06:29:49,365
THEY DO NOT RECALL ANY SUCH 

12395
06:29:49,365 --> 06:29:53,369
PARTY AND THAT I NEVER DID OR 

12396
06:29:53,369 --> 06:29:55,338
WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS. 

12397
06:29:55,338 --> 06:29:59,008
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATION IS NOT 

12398
06:29:59,008 --> 06:30:00,543
MERELY UNSUBASSISTANTED BUT IT 

12399
06:30:00,543 --> 06:30:02,445

12400
06:30:02,445 --> 06:30:03,546

REFUTEED. 

12403
06:30:12,689 --> 06:30:14,491
THIRD, DR. FORD HAS SAID THAT 

12404
06:30:14,491 --> 06:30:16,359
THIS EVENT HAPPENED AT A HOUSE 

12405
06:30:16,359 --> 06:30:17,394

MARYLAND. 

12410
06:30:25,068 --> 06:30:26,236
IN HER LETTER TO SENATOR 

12411
06:30:26,236 --> 06:30:27,871
FEINSTEIN SHE SAID THERE WERE 

12412
06:30:27,871 --> 06:30:30,573
FOUR OTHER PEOPLE AT THE HOUSE. 

12413
06:30:30,573 --> 06:30:33,476
NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, NOR I 

12414
06:30:33,476 --> 06:30:35,011
LIVE NEAR COLUMBIA COUNTRY 

12415
06:30:35,011 --> 06:30:35,645
CLUB. 

12416
06:30:35,645 --> 06:30:38,748
AS OF THE SUMMER OF 1982 DR. 

12417
06:30:38,748 --> 06:30:41,284
FORD WAS 15 AND COULD NOT DRIVE 

12418
06:30:41,284 --> 06:30:41,618
YET. 

12419
06:30:41,618 --> 06:30:45,822
SHE DID NOT LIVE NEAR COLUMBIA 

12420
06:30:45,822 --> 06:30:46,155
COUNTRY CLUB. 

12421
06:30:46,155 --> 06:30:47,290
SHE SAYS THAT SHE HAD ONE BEER 

12422
06:30:47,290 --> 06:30:48,724
AT THE PARTY BUT SHE DOESN'T 

12423
06:30:48,724 --> 06:30:52,695
SAY HOW SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE IN 

12424
06:30:52,695 --> 06:30:59,669
QUESTION OR HOW SHE GOT HOME OR 

12425
06:30:59,669 --> 06:31:02,872
WHO SE HOUSE IT WAS. 

12426
06:31:02,872 --> 06:31:04,073
I HAVE SUBMITTED DETAILED 

12427
06:31:04,073 --> 06:31:05,542
CALENDARS RECORDING MY 

12428
06:31:05,542 --> 06:31:09,178
ACTIVITIES IN THE SUMMER OF 

12429
06:31:09,178 --> 06:31:10,680
1982. 

12430
06:31:10,680 --> 06:31:11,848
WHY DID I KEEP CALENDARS? 

12431
06:31:11,848 --> 06:31:14,918
MY DAD STARTED TO KEEP DETAILED 

12432
06:31:14,918 --> 06:31:26,896
CALENDARS OF HIS LIFE IN 1978. 

12433
06:31:27,797 --> 06:31:33,803
HE DID SO AS BOTH A CALENDAR 

12434
06:31:33,803 --> 06:31:35,271
AND A DIARY IS HE A VERY 

12435
06:31:35,271 --> 06:31:43,379
ORGANIZED GUY TO PUT IT MILDLY. 

12436
06:31:50,853 --> 06:31:51,921
CHRISTMAS TIME WE SIT AROUND 

12437
06:31:51,921 --> 06:31:57,527
AND HE WOULD TELL US ABOUT OLD 

12438
06:31:57,527 --> 06:31:57,794
STORIES. 

12439
06:31:57,794 --> 06:31:59,429
OLD MILESTONES, OLD WEDDINGS, 

12440
06:31:59,429 --> 06:32:13,176
OLD EVENTS FROM HIS CALENDARS.

12441
06:32:13,176 --> 06:32:20,183
IN 9TH GRADE -- IN 9TH GRADE IN 

12442
06:32:20,183 --> 06:32:23,386
1980 I STARTED KEEPING 

12443
06:32:23,386 --> 06:32:24,053
CALENDARS OF MY OWN. 

12444
06:32:24,053 --> 06:32:26,623
FOR ME ALSO IT'S BOTH A 

12445
06:32:26,623 --> 06:32:28,124
CALENDAR AND A DIARY. 

12446
06:32:28,124 --> 06:32:32,595
I HAVE KEPT SUCH CALENDARS FOR 

12447
06:32:32,595 --> 06:32:33,229
THE LAST 38 YEARS. 

12448
06:32:33,229 --> 06:32:38,034
MINE ARE NOT AS GOOD AS MY 

12449
06:32:38,034 --> 06:32:39,535
DAD'S IN SOME YEARS. 

12450
06:32:39,535 --> 06:32:42,005
WHEN I WAS A KID THE CALENDARS 

12451
06:32:42,005 --> 06:32:44,674
ARE ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT 

12452
06:32:44,674 --> 06:32:46,309
FROM A KID. 

12453
06:32:46,309 --> 06:32:48,678
SOME GOOFY PARTS, SOME 

12454
06:32:48,678 --> 06:32:49,111
EMBARRASSING PARTS. 

12455
06:32:49,111 --> 06:32:55,385
I DID HAVE THE SUMMER OF 1982 

12456
06:32:55,385 --> 06:32:57,687

12457
06:32:57,687 --> 06:32:58,821
THE EVENT DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD 

12458
06:32:58,821 --> 06:33:01,024
SUPPOSEDLY HAPPENED ON A 

12459
06:33:01,024 --> 06:33:01,924
WEEKEND BECAUSE I BELIEVE 

12460
06:33:01,924 --> 06:33:04,827
EVERYBODY WORKED AND HAD JOBS 

12461
06:33:04,827 --> 06:33:06,161
IN THE SUMERNS. 

12462
06:33:06,161 --> 06:33:07,330
IN ANY EVENT A DRUNK, EARLY 

12463
06:33:07,330 --> 06:33:11,134

ON A WEEKEND. 

12466
06:33:14,636 --> 06:33:16,606
IF IT WAS A WEEKEND, MY 

12467
06:33:16,606 --> 06:33:19,008
CALENDAR SHOWS THAT I WAS OUT 

12468
06:33:19,008 --> 06:33:21,277

12514
06:35:31,140 --> 06:35:32,341
AND SCHOOL AND  GIRLS. 

12515
06:35:32,341 --> 06:35:34,210
SOME HAVE NOTICED THAT I DIDN'T 

12516
06:35:34,210 --> 06:35:37,713
HAVE CHURCH ON SUNDAYS ON MY 

12517
06:35:37,713 --> 06:35:38,013

BRUSHING MY TEETH, AUTOMATIC. 

12522
06:35:50,259 --> 06:35:50,526
STILL IS. 

12523
06:35:50,526 --> 06:35:53,563

12550
06:36:58,928 --> 06:37:02,865

12551
06:37:02,865 --> 06:37:04,366
WEEKDAY GATHERING AT FRIEND'S 

12552
06:37:04,366 --> 06:37:06,602
HOUSES AFTER A WORK BUT NONE OF

06:37:06,602 --> 06:37:07,737
THOSE INCLUDED THE GROUP OF 

12554
06:37:07,737 --> 06:37:11,574
PEOPLE THAT DR. FORD HAS 

12555
06:37:11,574 --> 06:37:11,874
IDENTIFIED. 

12556
06:37:11,874 --> 06:37:16,245
AS MY CALENDARS SHOW I WAS VERY 

12557
06:37:16,245 --> 06:37:18,848
PRECISE ABOUT LISTING WHO WAS 

12558
06:37:18,848 --> 06:37:19,081
THERE. 

12559
06:37:19,081 --> 06:37:20,115
VERY PRECISE. 

12560
06:37:20,115 --> 06:37:22,551
MY CALENDARS ALSO WERE DIARIES 

12561
06:37:22,551 --> 06:37:23,652
OF SORTS, FORWARD LOOKING AND 

12562
06:37:23,652 --> 06:37:25,054
BACKWARD LOOKING JUST LIKE MY 

12563
06:37:25,054 --> 06:37:25,254
DADS. 

12564
06:37:25,254 --> 06:37:28,157
YOU CAN SEE FOR EXAMPLE THAT I 

12565
06:37:28,157 --> 06:37:30,993
CROSSED OUT MISSED WORKOUTS AND 

12566
06:37:30,993 --> 06:37:32,495
THE CANCELED DOCTOR'S 

12567

APPOINTMENTS AND THAT I LISTED 

12568
06:37:34,397 --> 06:37:38,901
THE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP FOR 

12569
06:37:38,901 --> 06:37:39,268
CERTAIN EVENTS. 

12570
06:37:39,268 --> 06:37:42,672
THE CALENDARS ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT 

12571
06:37:42,672 --> 06:37:43,739
D ESPOSITIVE ON THEIR OWN WITH 

12572
06:37:43,739 --> 06:37:44,840
YOU THEY ARE ANOTHER PIECE OF 

12573
06:37:44,840 --> 06:37:51,013
EVIDENCE IN THE MIX FOR YOU TO 

12574
06:37:51,013 --> 06:37:54,784
CONSIDER.  

12575
06:38:03,058 --> 06:38:08,163
5TH, DR. FORD'S ALLEGATION IS 

12576
06:38:08,163 --> 06:38:15,571
RADICALLY  INCONSISTENT WITH MY 

12577
06:38:15,571 --> 06:38:16,472
CHARACTER AND RECORD. 

12578
06:38:16,472 --> 06:38:17,940
MANY OF US WERE FRIENDS AT MY 

12579
06:38:17,940 --> 06:38:20,543
SCHOOL AND REMAINED FRIENDS TO 

12580
06:38:20,543 --> 06:38:24,046
THIS DAY WITH STUDENTS AT LOCAL 

12581
06:38:24,046 --> 06:38:25,648
CATHOLIC ALL GIRLS SCHOOLS. 

12582
06:38:25,648 --> 06:38:27,350
ONE FEATURE OF MY LIFE THAT HAS 

12583
06:38:27,350 --> 06:38:28,451
REMAINED TRUE TO THE PRESENT 

12584
06:38:28,451 --> 06:38:32,054
DAY IS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A 

12585
06:38:32,054 --> 06:38:35,024
LOT OF CLOSE FEMALE FRIENDS. 

12586
06:38:35,024 --> 06:38:36,692
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT 

12587
06:38:36,692 --> 06:38:37,693
GIRLFRIENDS. 

12588
06:38:37,693 --> 06:38:41,564
I'M TALKING ABOUT FRIENDS WHO 

12589
06:38:41,564 --> 06:38:42,698
ARE WOMEN.  

12590
06:38:45,534 --> 06:38:46,835
THAT STARTED IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

12591
06:38:46,835 --> 06:38:48,671
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I'M AN 

12592
06:38:48,671 --> 06:38:50,272
ONLY CHILD AND HAD NO SISTERS 

12593
06:38:50,272 --> 06:38:51,874
BUT ANY WAY WE HAD NO SOCIAL 

12594
06:38:51,874 --> 06:38:55,011
MEDIA OR TEXTS OR E-MAIL AND WE 

12595
06:38:55,011 --> 06:38:56,011
TALKED ON THE PHONE. 

12596
06:38:56,011 --> 06:38:57,246
I REMEMBER TALKING ALMOST EVERY 

12597
06:38:57,246 --> 06:39:04,820
NIGHT IT SEEMED TO MY FRIENDS 

12598
06:39:04,820 --> 06:39:12,595
AMY OR JULIE OR KRISTIN OR 

12599
06:39:12,595 --> 06:39:13,996
KAREN OR SUZANNE OR NIKI. 

12600
06:39:13,996 --> 06:39:15,764
THE LIST GOES ON. 

12601
06:39:15,764 --> 06:39:16,565
FRIEND FORS A LIFETIME. 

12602
06:39:16,565 --> 06:39:19,802
BOIL ON A FOUNDATION OF TALKING 

12603
06:39:19,802 --> 06:39:23,372
THROUGH SCHOOL AND LIFE 

12604
06:39:23,372 --> 06:39:24,639
STARTING AT AGE 14. 

12605
06:39:24,639 --> 06:39:25,775
SEVERAL OF THOSE GREAT WOMEN 

12606
06:39:25,775 --> 06:39:31,180
ARE IN THE SEATS BEHIND ME 

12607
06:39:31,180 --> 06:39:31,413
TODAY. 

12608
06:39:31,413 --> 06:39:34,083
MY FRIENDS AND I SOMETIMES GOT 

12609
06:39:34,083 --> 06:39:35,817
TOGETHER AND HAD PARTIES ON 

12610
06:39:35,817 --> 06:39:36,084
WEEKENDS. 

12611
06:39:36,084 --> 06:39:38,120
THE DRINKING AGE WAS 18 IN 

12612
06:39:38,120 --> 06:39:39,754
MARYLAND FOR MOST OF MY TIME IN 

12613
06:39:39,754 --> 06:39:41,924
HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS 18 IN DC 

12614
06:39:41,924 --> 06:39:43,092
FOR ALL OF MY TIME. 

12615
06:39:43,092 --> 06:39:47,062
I DRANK BEER WITH MY FRIENDS. 

12616
06:39:47,062 --> 06:39:47,563
ALMOST EVERYBODY DID. 

12617
06:39:47,563 --> 06:39:52,702
SOMETIMES I HAD TOO MANY BEERS. 

12618
06:39:52,702 --> 06:39:54,870
SOMETIMES OTHERS DID. 

12619
06:39:54,870 --> 06:39:55,571
I LIKED BEER. 

12620
06:39:55,571 --> 06:39:56,272
I STILL LIKE BEER. 

12621
06:39:56,272 --> 06:39:59,408
I DID NOT DRINK BEER TO THE 

12622
06:39:59,408 --> 06:40:04,980
POINT OF BLACKING OUT. 

12623
06:40:04,980 --> 06:40:09,985
I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 

12624
06:40:09,985 --> 06:40:11,020
ANYONE. 

12625
06:40:11,020 --> 06:40:13,655
THERE IS A LINE BETWEEN 

12626
06:40:13,655 --> 06:40:14,824
DRINKING BEER AND ASSAULTING 

12627
06:40:14,824 --> 06:40:17,126
SOMEONE WHICH IS A VIOLENT 

12628
06:40:17,126 --> 06:40:17,426
CRIME. 

12629
06:40:17,426 --> 06:40:19,729
IF EVERY AMERICAN WHO DRINKS 

12630
06:40:19,729 --> 06:40:21,330
BEER OR EVERY AMERICAN WHO 

12631
06:40:21,330 --> 06:40:25,000
DRANK BEER IN HIGH SCHOOL IS 

12632
06:40:25,000 --> 06:40:26,202
SUDDENLY PRESUMED GUILTY OF 

12633
06:40:26,202 --> 06:40:28,671
SEXUAL ASSAULT WE WILL BE IN AN 

12634
06:40:28,671 --> 06:40:34,477
UGLY NEW PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY. 

12635
06:40:34,477 --> 06:40:36,679
I NEVER COMMITTED SEXUAL 

12636
06:40:36,679 --> 06:40:36,946
ASSAULT. 

12637
06:40:36,946 --> 06:40:38,914
AS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WE 

12638
06:40:38,914 --> 06:40:40,182
SOMETIMES DID GOOFY OR STUPID 

12639
06:40:40,182 --> 06:40:40,415
THINGS. 

12640
06:40:40,415 --> 06:40:42,284
I DOUBT WE WERE ALONE IN 

12641
06:40:42,284 --> 06:40:45,988
LOOKING BACK AT HIGH SCHOOL AND 

12642
06:40:45,988 --> 06:40:46,555
DRINKING AT SOME THINGS. 

12643
06:40:46,555 --> 06:40:50,526
FOR ONE THING OUR YEAR BOOK WAS 

12644
06:40:50,526 --> 06:40:50,826
A DISASTER. 

12645
06:40:50,826 --> 06:40:52,828
I THINK SOME EDITORS AND 

12646
06:40:52,828 --> 06:40:56,132
STUDENTS WANTED THE YEAR BOOK 

12647
06:40:56,132 --> 06:40:58,167
TO BE SOME COMBINATION OF 

12648
06:40:58,167 --> 06:41:04,006
ANIMAL HOUSE, CADDY SHACK AND 

12649
06:41:04,006 --> 06:41:07,009
FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH 

12650
06:41:07,009 --> 06:41:08,677
WHICH WERE ALL RECENT MOVIES. 

12651
06:41:08,677 --> 06:41:09,979
MANY OF US WENT TOA LOANING 

12652
06:41:09,979 --> 06:41:20,923
WITH IT TO THE POINT OF 

12653
06:41:20,923 --> 06:41:21,223
ABSURDITY. 

12654
06:41:21,223 --> 06:41:25,361
THIS PAST WEEK --  

12655
06:41:28,030 --> 06:41:38,908
WHEN WE READ ABOUT IT AND 

12656
06:41:38,908 --> 06:41:39,408
TALKED TO EACH OTHER.  

12657
06:41:47,149 --> 06:41:56,559
ONE THING IN PARTICULAR WE WERE 

12658
06:41:56,559 --> 06:42:04,033
SAD ABOUT ONE OF OUR GOOD --  

12659
06:42:05,334 --> 06:42:06,535
ONE OF OUR GOOD FEMALE FRIENDS 

12660
06:42:06,535 --> 06:42:09,405
WHO WE WOULD ADMIRE AND WENT TO 

12661
06:42:09,405 --> 06:42:10,706
DANCES WITH HAD HER NAME USED 

12662
06:42:10,706 --> 06:42:16,412
ON A YEAR BOOK PAGE WITH THE 

12663
06:42:16,412 --> 06:42:16,779
TERM ALUMNUS. 

12664
06:42:16,779 --> 06:42:17,813
IT WAS INTENDED TO SHOW 

12665
06:42:17,813 --> 06:42:19,715
AFFECTION AND THAT SHE WAS ONE 

12666
06:42:19,715 --> 06:42:22,284
OF US. 

12667
06:42:22,284 --> 06:42:24,720
IN THIS CIRCUS THE MEDIA HAS 

12668
06:42:24,720 --> 06:42:26,255
DECIDED THE TERM WAS RELATED TO 

12669
06:42:26,255 --> 06:42:26,455
SEX. 

12670
06:42:26,455 --> 06:42:28,290
IT WAS NOT RELATED TO SEX. 

12671
06:42:28,290 --> 06:42:29,458
THE WOMAN HERSELF NOTED ON THE 

12672
06:42:29,458 --> 06:42:32,361
RECORD IN THE MEDIA SHE AND I 

12673
06:42:32,361 --> 06:42:35,931
NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 

12674
06:42:35,931 --> 06:42:36,364
INTERACTION AT ALL. 

12675
06:42:36,364 --> 06:42:42,904
SO SORRY TO HER FOR THAT YEAR 

12676
06:42:42,904 --> 06:42:48,043
BOOK REFERENCE. 

12677
06:42:48,643 --> 06:42:52,715
THIS MAY SOUND A BIT TRIVIAL 

12678
06:42:52,715 --> 06:42:57,219
GIVING ALL THAT WE ARE HERE FOR 

12679
06:42:57,219 --> 06:42:58,420
BUT ONE THING I WANT TO TRY TO 

12680
06:42:58,420 --> 06:43:02,091
MAKE SURE OF IN THE FUTURE IS 

12681
06:43:02,091 --> 06:43:03,025
MY FRIENDSHIP WITH HER. 

12682
06:43:03,025 --> 06:43:08,697
SHE WAS AND IS A GREAT PERSON. 

12683
06:43:08,697 --> 06:43:11,734
AS TO SEX, THIS IS NOT A TOPIC 

12684
06:43:11,734 --> 06:43:13,769
I IMAGINED WOULD COME UP IN A 

12685
06:43:13,769 --> 06:43:14,736
CONFIRMATION HEARING BUT I WANT 

12686
06:43:14,736 --> 06:43:18,340
TO GIVE YOU A FULL PICTURE OF 

12687
06:43:18,340 --> 06:43:20,109
WHO I WAS. 

12688
06:43:20,109 --> 06:43:21,944
I NEVER HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE 

12689
06:43:21,944 --> 06:43:23,245
OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO IT DURING 

12690
06:43:23,245 --> 06:43:28,617
HIGH SCHOOL OR FOR MANY YEARS 

12691
06:43:28,617 --> 06:43:29,151
AFTER THAT. 

12692
06:43:29,151 --> 06:43:32,354
SOME CROWDS I WAS A LITTLE SHY 

12693
06:43:32,354 --> 06:43:33,388
ABOUT MY LACK OF EXPERIENCE. 

12694
06:43:33,388 --> 06:43:34,356
I TRIED TO HIDE THAT. 

12695
06:43:34,356 --> 06:43:38,160
THE SAME TIME I WAS ALSO 

12696
06:43:38,160 --> 06:43:38,927
INWARDLY PROUD OF IT. 

12697
06:43:38,927 --> 06:43:43,032
FOR ME AND THE GIRLS WHO I WAS 

12698
06:43:43,032 --> 06:43:47,869
FRIENDS WITH, THAT LACK OF 

12699
06:43:47,869 --> 06:43:50,906
MAJOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY WAS A 

12700
06:43:50,906 --> 06:43:53,442
MATTER OF FAITH AND RESPECT AND 

12701
06:43:53,442 --> 06:43:54,443
CAUTION. 

12702
06:43:54,443 --> 06:43:56,145
THE COMMITTEE HAS A LETTER FROM 

12703
06:43:56,145 --> 06:44:02,918
65 WOMEN WHO KNEW ME IN HIGH 

12704
06:44:02,918 --> 06:44:07,690
SCHOOL. 

12705
06:44:09,992 --> 06:44:13,862
THEY SAID THAT I ALWAYS TREATED 

12706
06:44:13,862 --> 06:44:15,730
THEM WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. 

12707
06:44:15,730 --> 06:44:18,934
THAT LETTER CAME TOGETHER IN 

12708
06:44:18,934 --> 06:44:21,537

12709
06:44:21,537 --> 06:44:23,839

12713
06:44:31,747 --> 06:44:38,354
KNEW -- THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE 

12714
06:44:38,354 --> 06:44:43,725
VILIFIED IF THEY DEFENDED ME. 

12715
06:44:43,725 --> 06:44:44,360
THINK ABOUT THAT. 

12716
06:44:44,360 --> 06:44:49,998
THEY PUT THEIRS ON THE LINE FOR 

12717
06:44:49,998 --> 06:44:51,033
ME. 

12718
06:44:51,033 --> 06:44:55,270
THOSE ARE SOME GREAT WOMEN. 

12719
06:44:55,270 --> 06:44:56,839
I LOVE ALL OF THEM.

SUPPORTED THEM IN THEIR SPORTS 

12726

AS A JUDGE SINCE 2006, I HAVE

FOR JUDGES AND THEN THEY MOVE 

12803
06:48:39,861 --> 06:48:41,028
ON IN THEIR CAREERS. 

12804
06:48:41,028 --> 06:48:44,466

JUST AFTER I TOOK THE BENCH IN 

12812
06:48:58,213 --> 06:49:00,849
2006 THERE WAS A MAJOR NEW YORK 

12813

A MAJORITY OF MY 48 LAW CLERKS 

12820
06:49:18,266 --> 06:49:18,800
HAVE BEEN WOMEN. 

12821
06:49:18,800 --> 06:49:20,368
IN A LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE 

12822

IN MY TIME ON THE BENCH NO 

12829
06:49:37,920 --> 06:49:40,856

12838
06:50:01,643 --> 06:50:05,046
JUST IN CASE I WAS CONFIRMED. 

12839
06:50:05,046 --> 06:50:09,851
AS PART OF THAT I HAD TO 

12840
06:50:09,851 --> 06:50:10,752
POTENTIALLY HIRE A FIRST GROUP 

12841
06:50:10,752 --> 06:50:12,254

COUPLE OF YEARS.

06:59:33,180 --> 06:59:35,383
WE PLAYED FOOTBALL TOGETHER. 

13062
06:59:35,383 --> 06:59:38,219
HE WAS A DEFENSIVE TACKLE. 

13063
06:59:38,219 --> 06:59:39,721
I WAS THE QUARTERBACK AND WIDE 

13064
06:59:39,721 --> 06:59:40,087

THE THREE OF US FOR 2 YEARS. 

13068
06:59:46,961 --> 06:59:49,731
I DID NOT HAVE A CAR, SO WE 

13069
06:59:49,731 --> 06:59:52,267
WOULD DRIVE EVERY DAY IN THEY 

13070
06:59:52,267 --> 06:59:56,304
WOULD PICK ME UP. 

13071
06:59:56,304 --> 06:59:58,940
>> WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP 

13072
06:59:58,940 --> 06:59:59,741
LIKE WITH HIM NOW? 

13073
06:59:59,741 --> 07:00:00,975
>> HE LIVES IN THE AREA. 

13074
07:00:00,975 --> 07:00:02,977
I SEE HIM ONCE IN A WHILE. 

13075
07:00:02,977 --> 07:00:04,812
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THIS 

13076
07:00:04,812 --> 07:00:05,045
THING.

>> I KNOW OF HER. 

13080
07:00:12,553 --> 07:00:16,290
IT IS POSSIBLE. 

13081
07:00:16,290 --> 07:00:18,927
I MET HER IN HIGH SCHOOL AT 

13082
07:00:18,927 --> 07:00:20,628
SOME POINT. 

13083
07:00:20,628 --> 07:00:22,330
I KNOW OF HER. 

13084
07:00:22,330 --> 07:00:28,436
I DON'T WANT TO RULE OUT HAVING 

13085
07:00:28,436 --> 07:00:29,904
CROSS PASSIVE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

>> CORRECT. 

13089
07:00:35,877 --> 07:00:41,349
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN.  

13090
07:00:41,349 --> 07:00:43,016
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IT IS MY 

13091
07:00:43,016 --> 07:00:45,954
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE 

13092
07:00:45,954 --> 07:00:47,321
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS BY DR. 

13093
07:00:47,321 --> 07:00:58,933
FORD, MS. RAMIREZ, AND MS. 

13094
07:00:58,933 --> 07:01:02,837
SWETNICK.  

13095
07:01:02,837 --> 07:01:03,838
ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE ASKED THE 

13096
07:01:03,838 --> 07:01:05,506
FBI TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS. 

13097
07:01:05,506 --> 07:01:07,709
I HAVE LISTENED TO WHAT YOU 

13098
07:01:07,709 --> 07:01:08,009
HAVE SAID. 

13099
07:01:08,009 --> 07:01:09,243
YOUR CONCERN IS EVIDENT AND 

13100
07:01:09,243 --> 07:01:10,445
CLEAR. 

13101
07:01:10,445 --> 07:01:11,646
IF YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT OF 

13102
07:01:11,646 --> 07:01:12,680
YOUR POSITION AND YOU APPEAR TO 

13103
07:01:12,680 --> 07:01:14,882
BE, WHY AREN'T YOU ALSO ASKING 

13104
07:01:14,882 --> 07:01:17,185
THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THESE 

13105
07:01:17,185 --> 07:01:22,457
CLAIMS? 

13106
07:01:22,457 --> 07:01:23,758
>> SENATOR, I WILL DO WHATEVER 

13107
07:01:23,758 --> 07:01:24,292
THE COMMITTEE WANTS. 

13108
07:01:24,292 --> 07:01:25,693
I WANTED A HEARING THE DAY 

13109
07:01:25,693 --> 07:01:26,728
AFTER THE ALLEGATION CAME UP. 

13110
07:01:26,728 --> 07:01:27,962
I WANTED TO BE HERE THAT DAY. 

13111
07:01:27,962 --> 07:01:31,999
INSTEAD, 10 DAYS PAST WERE ALL 

13112
07:01:31,999 --> 07:01:35,002
THIS NONSENSE IS COMING OUT. I 

13113
07:01:35,002 --> 07:01:36,271
AM ON GANGS. 

13114
07:01:36,271 --> 07:01:38,906
I AM ON BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND. 

13115
07:01:38,906 --> 07:01:42,110
I AM IN COLORADO, I AM CITED 

13116
07:01:42,110 --> 07:01:43,010
ALL OVER THE PLACE. 

13117
07:01:43,010 --> 07:01:45,380
THE THINGS ARE PRINTED AND RUN 

13118
07:01:45,380 --> 07:01:48,616
BREATHLESSLY BY CABLE NEWS. 

13119
07:01:48,616 --> 07:01:51,185
I WANTED A HEARING THE NEXT DAY.

13120
07:01:51,185 --> 07:01:53,154
MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY 

13121
07:01:53,154 --> 07:01:53,521
THIS, SENATOR. 

13122
07:01:53,521 --> 07:01:56,891
DESTROYED. 

13123
07:01:56,891 --> 07:01:59,827
WHATEVER THE COMMITTEE DECIDES, 

13124
07:01:59,827 --> 07:02:01,462
I AM ALL IN. 

13125
07:02:01,462 --> 07:02:05,333
>> THE QUESTION IS -- 

13126
07:02:05,333 --> 07:02:06,434
>> I AM ALL IN. 

13127
07:02:06,434 --> 07:02:08,636
>> THE TERRIBLE AND HARD PART 

13128
07:02:08,636 --> 07:02:10,571
OF THIS IS THAT WHEN WE GET AN 

13129
07:02:10,571 --> 07:02:13,708
ALLEGATION, WE ARE NOT IN A 

13130
07:02:13,708 --> 07:02:14,642
POSITION TO PROVE IT OR 

13131
07:02:14,642 --> 07:02:15,042
DISPROVE IT. 

13132
07:02:15,042 --> 07:02:16,377
HAVE TO DEPEND ON SOME OUTSIDE 

13133
07:02:16,377 --> 07:02:17,578
AUTHORITY FOR IT. 

13134
07:02:17,578 --> 07:02:20,314
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THE THAT 

13135
07:02:20,314 --> 07:02:21,582
WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS CAME 

13136
07:02:21,582 --> 07:02:24,986
FORWARD, THAT YOU WOULD WANT 

13137
07:02:24,986 --> 07:02:26,387
THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THOSE 

13138
07:02:26,387 --> 07:02:28,823
CLAIMS AND CLEAR IT UP ONCE AND 

13139
07:02:28,823 --> 07:02:31,726
FOR ALL. 

13140
07:02:31,726 --> 07:02:32,859
>> SENATOR, THE COMMITTEE 

13141
07:02:32,859 --> 07:02:36,831
INVESTIGATES -- IT IS NOT FOR 

13142
07:02:36,831 --> 07:02:38,433
ME TO SAY HOW TO DO IT, BUT 

13143
07:02:38,433 --> 07:02:39,967
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THE FBI DOES 

13144
07:02:39,967 --> 07:02:43,070
NOT COME TO A CONCLUSION. 

13145
07:02:43,070 --> 07:02:44,305
THEY WOULD GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF 

13146
07:02:44,305 --> 07:02:45,506
302 THAT JUST TELLS YOU WHAT WE 

13147
07:02:45,506 --> 07:02:45,807
SAID. 

13148
07:02:45,807 --> 07:02:46,374
I AM HERE. 

13149
07:02:46,374 --> 07:02:47,942
I WANTED TO BE HERE THE NEXT 

13150
07:02:47,942 --> 07:02:48,342
DAY. 

13151
07:02:48,342 --> 07:02:50,177
IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT I WAS NOT 

13152
07:02:50,177 --> 07:02:53,847
ALLOWED TO COME AND IMMEDIATELY 

13153
07:02:53,847 --> 07:02:55,249
DEFEND MY NAME AND SAY, I DID 

13154
07:02:55,249 --> 07:02:56,884
NOT DO THIS AND GIVE YOU ALL OF 

13155
07:02:56,884 --> 07:02:57,952
THE EVIDENCE. 

13156
07:02:57,952 --> 07:02:59,953
I AM NOT EVEN IN D.C. ON THE 

13157
07:02:59,953 --> 07:03:03,324
WEEKENDS IN THE SUMMER OF 1982. 

13158
07:03:03,324 --> 07:03:07,228
THIS HAPPENED ON A WEEKDAY? 

13159
07:03:07,228 --> 07:03:12,967
I'M NOT AT A SUMMER LEAGUE 

13160
07:03:12,967 --> 07:03:13,167
GAME? 

13161
07:03:13,167 --> 07:03:13,968
I'M NOT WORKING OUT? 

13162
07:03:13,968 --> 07:03:16,471
I'M NOT IN A MOVIE WITH SUZANNE?

13163
07:03:16,471 --> 07:03:20,641
I WANTED TO BE HERE RIGHT AWAY. 

13164
07:03:20,641 --> 07:03:24,912
>> THE DIFFICULT THING IS THAT 

13165
07:03:24,912 --> 07:03:28,582
THESE HEARINGS ARE SET BY THE 

13166
07:03:28,582 --> 07:03:33,020
MAJORITY, BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT

13167
07:03:33,020 --> 07:03:35,022
GETTING THE EVIDENCE AND HAVING 

13168
07:03:35,022 --> 07:03:39,527
THE EVIDENCE LOOKED AT. I DO 

13169
07:03:39,527 --> 07:03:44,799
NOT UNDERSTAND -- WE HEAR FROM 

13170
07:03:44,799 --> 07:03:51,105
THE WITNESSES, BUT THE FBI IS 

13171
07:03:51,105 --> 07:03:52,240
NOT INTERVIEWING THEM AND IS 

13172
07:03:52,240 --> 07:03:54,375
NOT GIVING US ANY FACTS. 

13173
07:03:54,375 --> 07:03:54,976
SO WE HAVE. 

13174
07:03:54,976 --> 07:03:56,110
>> YOU ARE INTERVIEWING ME. 

13175
07:03:56,110 --> 07:04:01,682
YOU ARE INTERVIEWING ME. 

13176
07:04:01,682 --> 07:04:02,683
YOU ARE DOING IT, SENATOR. 

13177
07:04:02,683 --> 07:04:04,218
I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT 

13178
07:04:04,218 --> 07:04:04,618
YOU'RE DOING IT. 

13179
07:04:04,618 --> 07:04:05,553
THERE IS NO CONCLUSIONS 

13180
07:04:05,553 --> 07:04:05,820
REACHED. 

13181
07:04:05,820 --> 07:04:07,088
>> WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, IF I 

13182
07:04:07,088 --> 07:04:08,122
UNDERSTAND IT, IS AT THE 

13183
07:04:08,122 --> 07:04:11,626
ALLEGATIONS BY DR. FORD, MS. 

13184
07:04:11,626 --> 07:04:15,263
RAMIREZ, AND MS. SWETNICK  ARE 

13185
07:04:15,263 --> 07:04:18,566
WRONG. 

13186
07:04:18,566 --> 07:04:19,600
>> THAT IS EMPHATICALLY WHAT I 

13187
07:04:19,600 --> 07:04:21,202
AM SAYING. 

13188
07:04:21,202 --> 07:04:25,239
EMPHATICALLY. úTHE SWETNICK THI 

13189
07:04:25,239 --> 07:04:28,910
THAT IS A FARCE. 

13190
07:04:28,910 --> 07:04:30,111
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY MORE 

13191
07:04:30,111 --> 07:04:31,078
ABOUT IT? 

13192
07:04:31,078 --> 07:04:34,282
>> NO. 

13193
07:04:34,282 --> 07:04:34,782
>> THAT IS IT. 

13194
07:04:34,782 --> 07:04:42,323
THANK YOU, MR CHAIRMAN. 

13195
07:04:42,323 --> 07:04:43,558
>> DR. FORD HAS DESCRIBED YOU 

13196
07:04:43,558 --> 07:04:44,759
AS BEING INTOXICATED AT A 

13197
07:04:44,759 --> 07:04:45,426
PARTY. 

13198
07:04:45,426 --> 07:04:47,828
DID YOU CONSUME ALCOHOL DURING 

13199
07:04:47,828 --> 07:04:51,032
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARS? 

13200
07:04:51,032 --> 07:04:52,700
>> YES. WE DRINK BEER. 

13201
07:04:52,700 --> 07:04:53,901
MY FRIENDS AND I, BOYS AND 

13202
07:04:53,901 --> 07:04:55,136
GIRLS, YES, WE DRINK BEER. 

13203
07:04:55,136 --> 07:04:56,537
I LIKE TO BEER. 

13204
07:04:56,537 --> 07:04:58,573
I STILL LIKE BEER. 

13205
07:04:58,573 --> 07:05:00,641
WE DRINK BEER. 

13206
07:05:00,641 --> 07:05:03,544
THE DRINKING AGE, AS I NOTED, 

13207
07:05:03,544 --> 07:05:04,278
WAS 18. 

13208
07:05:04,278 --> 07:05:06,280
SO THE SENIORS WERE LEGAL. 

13209
07:05:06,280 --> 07:05:07,882
WE WERE LEGAL TO DRINK. 

13210
07:05:07,882 --> 07:05:10,885
I SAID THAT SOMETIMES WE 

13211
07:05:10,885 --> 07:05:13,387
PROBABLY HAD TOO MANY BEERS AND 

13212
07:05:13,387 --> 07:05:14,956
SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE HAD TOO 

13213
07:05:14,956 --> 07:05:16,657
MANY BEERS. 

13214
07:05:16,657 --> 07:05:18,025
WE DRINK BEER. 

13215
07:05:18,025 --> 07:05:20,528
WE LIKE BEER. 

13216
07:05:20,528 --> 07:05:21,963
>> WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE TOO 

13217
07:05:21,963 --> 07:05:22,263
MANY BEERS? 

13218
07:05:22,263 --> 07:05:26,000
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

13219
07:05:26,000 --> 07:05:29,270
WHATEVER THE CHART SAYS. 

13220
07:05:29,270 --> 07:05:40,181
THE BLOOD-ALCOHOL CHART. 

13221
07:05:40,181 --> 07:05:41,516
>> WHEN YOU TALKED TO FOX NEWS 

13222
07:05:41,516 --> 07:05:42,650
THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID THAT 

13223
07:05:42,650 --> 07:05:43,951
THERE WERE TIMES IN HIGH SCHOOL 

13224
07:05:43,951 --> 07:05:45,286
WHEN PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HAD TOO 

13225
07:05:45,286 --> 07:05:45,987
MANY BEERS ON OCCASION. 

13226
07:05:45,987 --> 07:05:47,288
DOES THAT INCLUDE YOU? 

13227
07:05:47,288 --> 07:05:47,855
>> SURE. 

13228
07:05:47,855 --> 07:05:49,523
>> HAVE YOU EVER PASSED OUT 

13229
07:05:49,523 --> 07:05:50,191
FROM DRINKING? 

13230
07:05:50,191 --> 07:05:54,862
>> PASSED OUT WOULD BE, NO. 

13231
07:05:54,862 --> 07:05:56,263
I'VE GONE TO SLEEP, BUT I HAVE 

13232
07:05:56,263 --> 07:05:56,897
NEVER BLACKED OUT. 

13233
07:05:56,897 --> 07:06:02,503
THAT IS THE ALLEGATION AND THAT 

13234
07:06:02,503 --> 07:06:04,372
IS WRONG. 

13235
07:06:04,372 --> 07:06:06,007
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR TIME 

13236
07:06:06,007 --> 07:06:06,440
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

13237
07:06:06,440 --> 07:06:08,643
IN HIGH SCHOOL, AFTER DRINKING, 

13238
07:06:08,643 --> 07:06:10,244
DID YOU EVER WAKE UP IN A 

13239
07:06:10,244 --> 07:06:11,278
DIFFERENT LOCATION THAN YOU 

13240
07:06:11,278 --> 07:06:13,414
REMEMBERED PASSING OUT OR GOING 

13241
07:06:13,414 --> 07:06:14,281
TO SLEEP?

07:06:14,281 --> 07:06:15,282
>> NO. 

13243
07:06:15,282 --> 07:06:16,384

>> DID YOU EVER WAKE UP WITH 

13245
07:06:19,387 --> 07:06:20,421
YOUR CLOSE IN A DIFFERENT 

13246
07:06:20,421 --> 07:06:22,423
CONDITION OR FEWER CLOTHES ON 

13247
07:06:22,423 --> 07:06:23,491
AND YOU REMEMBERED WHEN YOU 

13248
07:06:23,491 --> 07:06:26,093
WENT TO SLEEP OR PASSED OUT? 

13249
07:06:26,093 --> 07:06:26,761
>> NO. 

13250
07:06:26,761 --> 07:06:28,162
NO. 

13251
07:06:28,162 --> 07:06:33,434
>> DID YOU EVER -- DID ANYONE 

13252
07:06:33,434 --> 07:06:34,468
EVER TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING 

13253
07:06:34,468 --> 07:06:35,670
THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR PRESENCE 

13254
07:06:35,670 --> 07:06:37,071
THAT YOU DID NOT REMEMBER 

13255
07:06:37,071 --> 07:06:38,706
DURING A TIME THAT YOU HAD BEEN 

13256
07:06:38,706 --> 07:06:40,207

13257
07:06:40,207 --> 07:06:41,375
>> NO. 

13258
07:06:41,375 --> 07:06:49,250
WE DRINK BEER. 

13259
07:06:49,250 --> 07:06:50,284
AND SODA THE VAST MAJORITY OF 

13260
07:06:50,284 --> 07:06:52,720
PEOPLE OUR AGE AT THE TIME. 

13261
07:06:52,720 --> 07:06:55,790
IN ANY EVENT, WE DRANK BEER AND 

13262
07:06:55,790 --> 07:06:59,026
WE STILL DO. 

13263
07:06:59,026 --> 07:07:03,931
WHATEVER. 

13264
07:07:03,931 --> 07:07:05,232
>> DURING THE TIME IN HIGH 

13265
07:07:05,232 --> 07:07:06,133
SCHOOL WHEN YOU WOULD BE 

13266
07:07:06,133 --> 07:07:07,268
DRINKING, DID ANYONE EVER TELL 

13267
07:07:07,268 --> 07:07:08,469
YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU 

13268
07:07:08,469 --> 07:07:09,303
DID NOT REMEMBER? 

13269
07:07:09,303 --> 07:07:09,970

>> THEY ARE BOTH FORWARD-

13338
07:09:38,785 --> 07:09:39,486
LOOKING AND BACKWARD LOOKING, 

13339
07:09:39,486 --> 07:09:40,988
AS YOU CAN TELL FROM LOOKING AT 

13340
07:09:40,988 --> 07:09:41,956
THEM BECAUSE I CROSSED OUT 

13341
07:09:41,956 --> 07:09:42,590
CERTAIN DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS 

13342
07:09:42,590 --> 07:09:43,791
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN OR ONE 

13343
07:09:43,791 --> 07:09:45,192
NIGHT, WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO 

13344
07:09:45,192 --> 07:09:48,229
LIFT WEIGHTS, I CROSS THAT OUT 

13345
07:09:48,229 --> 07:09:49,063
BECAUSE I OBVIOUSLY DID NOT 

13346
07:09:49,063 --> 07:09:49,864
MAKE IT THAT NIGHT. 

13347
07:09:49,864 --> 07:09:52,266
YOU CAN SEE THINGS THAT I DID 

13348
07:09:52,266 --> 07:09:52,700
NOT DO. 

13349
07:09:52,700 --> 07:09:56,937
THEY WERE CROSSED OUT. 

13350
07:09:56,937 --> 07:09:57,972
AND ALSO, WHEN I LISTED 

13351
07:09:57,972 --> 07:10:00,808
SPECIFIC PEOPLE THAT I WAS WITH,

13352
07:10:00,808 --> 07:10:03,744
THAT IS LIKELY BACKWARD LOOKING.

13353
07:10:03,744 --> 07:10:06,480
>> YOU EXPLAIN THAT YOU KEPT 

13354
07:10:06,480 --> 07:10:10,050
THESE CALENDARS BECAUSE YOUR 

13355
07:10:10,050 --> 07:10:11,018
FATHER STARTED KEEPING THEM IN 

13356
07:10:11,018 --> 07:10:12,653
1978, I BELIEVE YOU SAID. 

13357
07:10:12,653 --> 07:10:15,256
THAT IS WHAT YOU KEPT THEM. 

13358
07:10:15,256 --> 07:10:17,024
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WROTE ON 

13359
07:10:17,024 --> 07:10:19,727
THEM IN BUT WHY DID YOU KEEP 

13360
07:10:19,727 --> 07:10:20,861
THEM UP UNTIL THIS TIME? 

13361
07:10:20,861 --> 07:10:22,663
>> HE HAS KEPT THEM AS WELL 

13362
07:10:22,663 --> 07:10:22,996
SINCE 1978. 

13363
07:10:22,996 --> 07:10:26,033
HE IS A GOOD ROLE MODEL.

BLAZING, DEFIANT, TO THE SENATE 

13372
07:10:59,934 --> 07:11:01,535
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, FOLLOWING 

13373
07:11:01,535 --> 07:11:05,306
ACCUSATIONS OF ASSAULT FROM DR. 

13374
07:11:05,306 --> 07:11:06,607
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.  

13375
07:11:06,607 --> 07:11:08,442
HERE TO DISCUSS WITH ME IS 

13376
07:11:08,442 --> 07:11:12,413
CAITLIN HUEY BURNS, LESLIE 

13377
07:11:12,413 --> 07:11:13,113
SANCHEZ, A REPUBLICAN 

13378
07:11:13,113 --> 07:11:15,249
STRATEGIST, AND JESSE WEBER, AN 

13379
07:11:15,249 --> 07:11:17,751
ATTORNEY AND HOST ON THE LAW 

13380
07:11:17,751 --> 07:11:20,120
AND CRIME NETWORK. 

13381
07:11:20,120 --> 07:11:22,289
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 

13382
07:11:22,289 --> 07:11:25,326
THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO.

13383
07:11:25,326 --> 07:11:26,861
AT THE BEGINNING, HE WAS 

13384
07:11:26,861 --> 07:11:27,127
TEARFUL. 

13385
07:11:27,127 --> 07:11:32,800
HE WAS CLEARLY SHOOK UP. 

13386
07:11:32,800 --> 07:11:33,067
DEFIANT. 

13387
07:11:33,067 --> 07:11:34,435
UPSET. 

13388
07:11:34,435 --> 07:11:35,903
ANGRY. 

13389
07:11:35,903 --> 07:11:37,071
A RANGE OF EMOTIONS. 

13390
07:11:37,071 --> 07:11:38,706
TO THINK THAT HE HIT THE RIGHT 

13391
07:11:38,706 --> 07:11:38,939
NOTES? 

13392
07:11:38,939 --> 07:11:41,976
>> THERE IS A REASON THAT YOU 

13393
07:11:41,976 --> 07:11:42,976
NEVER WANT TO PUT A DEFENDANT 

13394
07:11:42,976 --> 07:11:43,677
ON THE STAND. 

13395
07:11:43,677 --> 07:11:44,611
THIS IS NOT A TRIAL. 

13396
07:11:44,611 --> 07:11:54,288
I WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR. 

13397
07:11:54,288 --> 07:11:55,589
THIS IS NOT ABOUT GETTING TO 

13398
07:11:55,589 --> 07:11:55,990
THE TRUTH. 

13399
07:11:55,990 --> 07:11:57,524
THERE IS NOT A JURY HERE TO TRY 

13400
07:11:57,524 --> 07:11:59,059
TO GET TO SEE IF HE IS GUILTY 

13401
07:11:59,059 --> 07:11:59,660
OR NOT. 

13402
07:11:59,660 --> 07:12:00,461
THIS IS ABOUT HIS 

13403
07:12:00,461 --> 07:12:01,295
QUALIFICATIONS AND WHETHER NOT 

13404
07:12:01,295 --> 07:12:01,895
HE WILL BE NOMINATED. 

13405
07:12:01,895 --> 07:12:03,430
BUT WHEN HE FIRST CAME OUT, HE 

13406
07:12:03,430 --> 07:12:04,531
NEEDED TO NOT BE ROMANTIC, 

13407
07:12:04,531 --> 07:12:05,766
WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW IN THE 

13408
07:12:05,766 --> 07:12:06,066
PAST. 

13409
07:12:06,066 --> 07:12:07,167
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE VEERED A 

13410
07:12:07,167 --> 07:12:08,202
LITTLE BIT TO EMOTIONAL. 

13411
07:12:08,202 --> 07:12:09,403
AND A LITTLE BIT TOO OUT OF 

13412
07:12:09,403 --> 07:12:09,670
CONTROL. 

13413
07:12:09,670 --> 07:12:10,404
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

13414
07:12:10,404 --> 07:12:11,972
BEING VERY STRONG AND CREDIBLE, 

13415
07:12:11,972 --> 07:12:17,711
WHICH IS WHAT HE NEEDED TO BE. 

13416
07:12:17,711 --> 07:12:18,646
AND THERE WAS A STRONG 

13417
07:12:18,646 --> 07:12:19,747
PERFORMANCE BY DR. FORD THIS 

13418
07:12:19,747 --> 07:12:20,748
MORNING, AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING 

13419
07:12:20,748 --> 07:12:21,982
LIKE, HE IS GOING OVER THE EDGE 

13420
07:12:21,982 --> 07:12:22,583
A LITTLE BIT. 

13421
07:12:22,583 --> 07:12:23,784
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BETTER 

13422
07:12:23,784 --> 07:12:25,419
THING TO SAY IS, IF YOU WANT AN 

13423
07:12:25,419 --> 07:12:26,453
FBI INVESTIGATION, GO FOR. 

13424
07:12:26,453 --> 07:12:27,888
BUT IF YOU CLEAR MY NAME, YOU 

13425
07:12:27,888 --> 07:12:30,758
HAVE TO VOTE AND CONFIRM ME. 

13426
07:12:30,758 --> 07:12:32,259
>> DO YOU THINK HE HAD THE 

13427
07:12:32,259 --> 07:12:33,594
RIGHT NOTES OR DID HE GO TOO 

13428
07:12:33,594 --> 07:12:33,894
FAR? 

13429
07:12:33,894 --> 07:12:34,995
>> I THINK, REGARDLESS OF THIS, 

13430
07:12:34,995 --> 07:12:36,430
DOES A VERY PAINFUL PROCESS TO 

13431
07:12:36,430 --> 07:12:36,663
WATCH. 

13432
07:12:36,663 --> 07:12:38,265
IT IS VERY PERSONAL HERE. 

13433
07:12:38,265 --> 07:12:40,334
IT HAS ALSO BECOME HYPER- 

13434
07:12:40,334 --> 07:12:41,902
PARTISAN. IN THIS CASE, THE 

13435
07:12:41,902 --> 07:12:45,039
JUDGE BECAME HYPER- PARTISAN. 

13436
07:12:45,039 --> 07:12:46,573
IN TERMS OF HIS CONTRAST, HIS 

13437
07:12:46,573 --> 07:12:51,645
ATTITUDE. 

13438
07:12:51,645 --> 07:12:52,546
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE IS 

13439
07:12:52,546 --> 07:12:53,680
DEFENDING HIS NAME, HIS FAMILY, 

13440
07:12:53,680 --> 07:12:54,681
AND HIS HONOR, BUT THIS 

13441
07:12:54,681 --> 07:12:55,716
CONTENTIOUS BACK AND FORTH WITH 

13442
07:12:55,716 --> 07:12:57,051
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WILL WORK IN 

13443
07:12:57,051 --> 07:12:57,785
REPUBLICAN CIRCLES. 

13444
07:12:57,785 --> 07:12:58,352
THE PRAISING OF PRESIDENT 

13445
07:12:58,352 --> 07:13:00,020
TRUMP, THE ACTUALLY WORKS IF 

13446
07:13:00,020 --> 07:13:03,057
THE AUDIENCE IS AT 1600 

13447
07:13:03,057 --> 07:13:03,390
PENNSYLVANIA. 

13448
07:13:03,390 --> 07:13:04,558
>> THAT IS A GOOD POINT. 

13449
07:13:04,558 --> 07:13:07,728
HE THROUGHOUT THE WINDOW THE 

13450
07:13:07,728 --> 07:13:09,229
MYTH THAT THIS IS SUPPOSED BE A 

13451
07:13:09,229 --> 07:13:09,696
NONPARTISAN PROCESS. 

13452
07:13:09,696 --> 07:13:10,564
HE ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE A 

13453
07:13:10,564 --> 07:13:11,365
POLITICAL CANDIDATE AT SOME 

13454
07:13:11,365 --> 07:13:11,598
POINTS. 

13455
07:13:11,598 --> 07:13:13,701
HE CAME OUT SO HARD AGAINST THE 

13456
07:13:13,701 --> 07:13:14,001
DEMOCRATS. 

13457
07:13:14,001 --> 07:13:15,836
>> THAT IS WHAT IS LOST IN ALL 

13458
07:13:15,836 --> 07:13:16,236
OF THIS. 

13459
07:13:16,236 --> 07:13:17,638
WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHERE 

13460
07:13:17,638 --> 07:13:18,639
EVERYTHING BROKE DOWN, WE WILL 

13461
07:13:18,639 --> 07:13:22,309
SEE THIS PAGE IN HISTORY. 

13462
07:13:22,309 --> 07:13:23,510
IT IS CONTENTIOUS AND IT IS 

13463
07:13:23,510 --> 07:13:24,645
HIGHLY PARTISAN, AND IN MANY 

13464
07:13:24,645 --> 07:13:28,816
CASES, IT HAS BEEN VERY SEXIST, 

13465
07:13:28,816 --> 07:13:30,417
BUT IN THIS CASE, YOU SEE THE 

13466
07:13:30,417 --> 07:13:31,452
JUDGE HAVING TO GO THERE, NOT 

13467
07:13:31,452 --> 07:13:32,452
ONLY WITH THE BOXES INTERVIEW, 

13468
07:13:32,452 --> 07:13:33,887
BUT NOW THE GLOVES ARE OFF AND 

13469
07:13:33,887 --> 07:13:36,957
IT IS EXTREMELY PARTISAN AND HE 

13470
07:13:36,957 --> 07:13:37,558
IS TRIPPING. 

13471
07:13:37,558 --> 07:13:38,892
>> AND WE ALL LOST SOMETHING BY 

13472
07:13:38,892 --> 07:13:39,393
THAT, I THINK. 

13473
07:13:39,393 --> 07:13:41,628
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION? 

13474
07:13:41,628 --> 07:13:43,063
>> THIS IS A TOUGH DAY FOR 

13475
07:13:43,063 --> 07:13:43,864
EVERYBODY INVOLVED. 

13476
07:13:43,864 --> 07:13:45,298
THE TESTIMONY FROM DR. FORD WAS 

13477
07:13:45,298 --> 07:13:47,034
COMPELLING, GUT WRENCHING AT 

13478
07:13:47,034 --> 07:13:49,203
TIMES, AND ELICITING EMOTIONAL 

13479
07:13:49,203 --> 07:13:50,637
REACTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE 

13480
07:13:50,637 --> 07:13:53,007
WATCHING. 

13481
07:13:53,007 --> 07:13:59,780
THE JUDGE'S TESTIMONY, JUDGE 

13482
07:13:59,780 --> 07:14:00,714
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, WHEN HE 

13483
07:14:00,714 --> 07:14:01,415
WAS GETTING EMOTIONAL, TALKING 

13484
07:14:01,415 --> 07:14:02,716
ABOUT HIS OWN FAMILY AND WHAT 

13485
07:14:02,716 --> 07:14:03,650
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH 

13486
07:14:03,650 --> 07:14:04,351
THROUGHOUT THE 10 DAYS SINCE 

13487
07:14:04,351 --> 07:14:05,185
THE ALLEGATIONS SURFACED, WILL 

13488
07:14:05,185 --> 07:14:08,989
ALSO TUG AT -- EVOKES OF 

13489
07:14:08,989 --> 07:14:12,393
EMOTION FROM PEOPLE AS WELL. 

13490
07:14:12,393 --> 07:14:13,727
I AM WAITING TO SEE, THOUGH, 

13491
07:14:13,727 --> 07:14:14,561
HOW HE HANDLES THE QUESTIONING. 

13492
07:14:14,561 --> 07:14:15,762
MEMBER, THE DEMOCRATIC WAS 

13493
07:14:15,762 --> 07:14:20,234
SENATORS ARE NOT TO BE KIND TO 

13494
07:14:20,234 --> 07:14:21,835
HIM THE WAY THEY WANTED TO SHOW 

13495
07:14:21,835 --> 07:14:23,036
SUPPORT FOR DR. FORD AND FOR 

13496
07:14:23,036 --> 07:14:24,037
WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH. 

13497
07:14:24,037 --> 07:14:26,139
THEY ARE GOING TO GRILL JUDGE 

13498
07:14:26,139 --> 07:14:29,910
KAVANAUGH TO EVERY EXTENT THAT 

13499
07:14:29,910 --> 07:14:31,578
THEY CAN. 

13500
07:14:31,578 --> 07:14:32,579
WATCHING HOW HE RESPONDS TO 

13501
07:14:32,579 --> 07:14:34,515
THAT WILL BE REALLY TELLING. 

13502
07:14:34,515 --> 07:14:35,849
DID HE NEGATE ANY OF THIS OF 

13503
07:14:35,849 --> 07:14:37,151
THE THAT HE MAY HAVE GARNERED 

13504
07:14:37,151 --> 07:14:38,051
EARLIER IN THE TESTIMONY? 

13505
07:14:38,051 --> 07:14:43,590
WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER, AS 

13506
07:14:43,590 --> 07:14:44,892
LESLIE MEHTA, WHO HE IS TRYING 

13507
07:14:44,892 --> 07:14:45,626
TO TALK TO HERE. 

13508
07:14:45,626 --> 07:14:47,494
IS IT DONALD TRUMP? 

13509
07:14:47,494 --> 07:14:50,931
IS IT THE COLLINS AND 

13510
07:14:50,931 --> 07:14:58,205
MURKOWSKI'S OF THE SENATE. 

13511
07:14:58,205 --> 07:14:59,506
>> WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE 

13512
07:14:59,506 --> 07:15:00,807
BIT OF SOME OF HIS MORE 

13513
07:15:00,807 --> 07:15:01,441
EMOTIONAL WORDS. 

13514
07:15:01,441 --> 07:15:02,643
I THINK WHERE HE WAS THE MOST 

13515
07:15:02,643 --> 07:15:03,677
TOUCHING WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT 

13516
07:15:03,677 --> 07:15:04,178
HIS FAMILY. 

13517
07:15:04,178 --> 07:15:05,479
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. 

13518
07:15:05,479 --> 07:15:07,414
>> I INTEND NO ILL WILL DR. 

13519
07:15:07,414 --> 07:15:09,950
FORD AND HER FAMILY. 

13520
07:15:09,950 --> 07:15:11,018
THE OTHER NIGHT, ASHLEY MY 

13521
07:15:11,018 --> 07:15:13,219
DAUGHTER SAID THEIR PRAYERS AND 

13522
07:15:13,219 --> 07:15:24,231
LITTLE LIZA, 10 YEARS OLD,, 

13523
07:15:24,231 --> 07:15:26,100
SAID TO ASHLEY, WE SHOULD PRAY 

13524
07:15:26,100 --> 07:15:29,670
FOR THE WOMAN. 

13525
07:15:29,670 --> 07:15:31,271
THERE'S A LOT OF WISDOM FROM A 

13526
07:15:31,271 --> 07:15:35,843
10-YEAR-OLD. 

13527
07:15:35,843 --> 07:15:50,324
WE MEAN NO ILL WILL. 

13528
07:15:50,324 --> 07:15:51,992
>> THAT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF 

13529
07:15:51,992 --> 07:15:53,961
THE MORE POIGNANT MOMENTS. 

13530
07:15:53,961 --> 07:15:54,962
YOU CERTAINLY CANNOT ARGUE WITH 

13531
07:15:54,962 --> 07:15:56,129
A 10-YEAR-OLD PRAYING FOR 

13532
07:15:56,129 --> 07:15:56,697
SOMEONE. 

13533
07:15:56,697 --> 07:15:58,332
I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU 

13534
07:15:58,332 --> 07:16:00,868
THINK, A MAN CRYING IN PUBLIC 

13535
07:16:00,868 --> 07:16:02,536
IS HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD 

13536
07:16:02,536 --> 07:16:08,242
THAN A WOMAN CRYING IN PUBLIC. 

13537
07:16:08,242 --> 07:16:09,376
DO YOU THINK, IN OTHER WORDS, 

13538
07:16:09,376 --> 07:16:10,611
THE HE WAS GIVEN POINTS FOR 

13539
07:16:10,611 --> 07:16:12,112
THAT SHOW OF EMOTION,'S, HAD 

13540
07:16:12,112 --> 07:16:13,013
DR. FORD, PERHAPS BROKEN DOWN 

13541
07:16:13,013 --> 07:16:14,147
ON THAT LEVEL, SHE MIGHT NOT 

13542
07:16:14,147 --> 07:16:16,383
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE SAME CREDIT?

13543
07:16:16,383 --> 07:16:17,184
WHAT YOU THINK? 

13544
07:16:17,184 --> 07:16:19,419
>> I THINK THAT SO MANY PEOPLE 

13545
07:16:19,419 --> 07:16:21,088
ARE TRYING TO MAKE HIM THE 

13546
07:16:21,088 --> 07:16:23,323
VILLAIN AND HE PUSHES BACK 

13547
07:16:23,323 --> 07:16:23,724
AGAINST THAT. 

13548
07:16:23,724 --> 07:16:25,559
HE SHOWED A VERY STRONG SENSE OF

13549
07:16:25,559 --> 07:16:25,826
HUMANITY. 

13550
07:16:25,826 --> 07:16:26,994
A STRONG SENSE OF HIS OWN 

13551
07:16:26,994 --> 07:16:30,630
PERSONAL FAITH AND COMPASSION. 

13552
07:16:30,630 --> 07:16:31,965
THAT EMPATHY FOR DR. FORD WILL 

13553
07:16:31,965 --> 07:16:34,601
CARRY A LOT OF WEIGHT. 

13554
07:16:34,601 --> 07:16:35,802
PEOPLE BE CONFUSED, AND HE 

13555
07:16:35,802 --> 07:16:37,304
CANNOT SAY 100% -- EITHER ONE 

13556
07:16:37,304 --> 07:16:38,305
OF THEM IS 100% CORRECT. 

13557
07:16:38,305 --> 07:16:42,376
THAT MAY BE FUNDAMENTALLY, IF 

13558
07:16:42,376 --> 07:16:44,210
THERE IS A WINNING, IN TERMS OF 

13559
07:16:44,210 --> 07:16:47,514
CONFIRMATION, THAT SALVAGES HIS 

13560
07:16:47,514 --> 07:16:47,881
NOMINATION. 

13561
07:16:47,881 --> 07:16:49,483
>> I THINK WE ARE IN A LOSE 

13562
07:16:49,483 --> 07:16:49,883
LOSE SITUATION. 

13563
07:16:49,883 --> 07:16:51,518
GUARD US OF HOW THIS TURNS OUT, 

13564
07:16:51,518 --> 07:16:52,886
THERE ARE SOME BROKEN LIVES. 

13565
07:16:52,886 --> 07:16:54,888
>> EXACTLY. 

13566
07:16:54,888 --> 07:16:56,023
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW 

13567
07:16:56,023 --> 07:16:57,024
ANYBODY COMES OUT OF THIS, 

13568
07:16:57,024 --> 07:16:59,793
WHETHER IT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

13569
07:16:59,793 --> 07:17:04,431
WINNING, MEANING HE IS NOMINATED

13570
07:17:04,431 --> 07:17:05,766
TO THE SUPREME COURT OR 

13571
07:17:05,766 --> 07:17:06,800
CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT, 

13572
07:17:06,800 --> 07:17:08,902
THIS WILL HAVE THEIR OVER COVER 

13573
07:17:08,902 --> 07:17:09,236
OVER HIM. 

13574
07:17:09,236 --> 07:17:13,807
THIS IS A HISTORIC DAY IN EVERY 

13575
07:17:13,807 --> 07:17:19,880
SENSE THE WORD. 

13576
07:17:19,880 --> 07:17:21,181
AND FOR DR. FORD, IT IS HARD TO 

13577
07:17:21,181 --> 07:17:21,782
SEE BOTH SIDES. 

13578
07:17:21,782 --> 07:17:23,317
IT IS HARD TO SEE WHERE THERE 

13579
07:17:23,317 --> 07:17:24,952
IS A VICTORY HERE, IF THAT IS A 

13580
07:17:24,952 --> 07:17:25,752
WORD THEY ARE USING. 

13581
07:17:25,752 --> 07:17:27,254
WHAT I AM ALSO GOING TO WATCH 

13582
07:17:27,254 --> 07:17:28,321
FOR IN THE COMING QUESTIONING, 

13583
07:17:28,321 --> 07:17:29,456
IS, HOW POLITICAL THIS DOES 

13584
07:17:29,456 --> 07:17:29,722
BECOME. 

13585
07:17:29,722 --> 07:17:30,557
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A JUSTICE 

13586
07:17:30,557 --> 07:17:31,958
FOR THE SUPREME COURT OF THE 

13587
07:17:31,958 --> 07:17:32,592
UNITED STATES, WHICH WAS 

13588
07:17:32,592 --> 07:17:34,328
SUPPOSED TO BE REMOVED FROM 

13589
07:17:34,328 --> 07:17:34,795
POLITICS. 

13590
07:17:34,795 --> 07:17:38,865
THE JUDGE, IN HIS VERSACE WITH 

13591
07:17:38,865 --> 07:17:42,236
FOX NEWS EARLIER THIS WEEK, 

13592
07:17:42,236 --> 07:17:43,737
SAID HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE BAIT 

13593
07:17:43,737 --> 07:17:44,438
WHEN ASKED SEVERAL TIMES 

13594
07:17:44,438 --> 07:17:45,906
WHETHER THE MOTIVATIONS OF THIS 

13595
07:17:45,906 --> 07:17:46,973
WERE POLITICAL. 

13596
07:17:46,973 --> 07:17:48,642
HE DID NOT ENGAGE THEM THAT 

13597
07:17:48,642 --> 07:17:49,609
TODAY. 

13598
07:17:49,609 --> 07:17:51,812
IT DOES SEEM TO BE A PILLAR OF 

13599
07:17:51,812 --> 07:17:55,282
HIS DEFENSE, SAYING THAT IT WAS 

13600
07:17:55,282 --> 07:17:55,715
ABOUT THE PROCESS. 

13601
07:17:55,715 --> 07:17:57,317
HE IS SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN THE 

13602
07:17:57,317 --> 07:17:58,252
AUDIENCE ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT 

13603
07:17:58,252 --> 07:17:59,452
TO GO AS A COUNTRY. 

13604
07:17:59,452 --> 07:18:00,487
FOR SOME PEOPLE, THAT MEANS 

13605
07:18:00,487 --> 07:18:00,987
LEAVING IN FORD. 

13606
07:18:00,987 --> 07:18:04,057
>> LET'S BRING IN BRIEFLY THE 

13607
07:18:04,057 --> 07:18:06,927
SOUND WHERE HE REFERENCED 

13608
07:18:06,927 --> 07:18:08,128
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

13609
07:18:08,128 --> 07:18:08,962
>> THIS WHOLE TWO-WEEK EFFORT 

13610
07:18:08,962 --> 07:18:09,963
HAS BEEN A CALCULATED AND 

13611
07:18:09,963 --> 07:18:12,199
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT. 

13612
07:18:12,199 --> 07:18:14,434
FUELED WITH APPARENT PENT UP 

13613
07:18:14,434 --> 07:18:16,269
ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

13614
07:18:16,269 --> 07:18:21,708
THE ONLY 16 ELECTION. 

13615
07:18:21,708 --> 07:18:23,143
FEAR THAT HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY 

13616
07:18:23,143 --> 07:18:25,979
STOKED ABOUT MY JUDICIAL 

13617
07:18:25,979 --> 07:18:26,380
RECORD. 

13618
07:18:26,380 --> 07:18:27,814
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE 

13619
07:18:27,814 --> 07:18:28,081
CLINTONS. 

13620
07:18:28,081 --> 07:18:29,850
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 

13621
07:18:29,850 --> 07:18:35,255
MONEY FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING 

13622
07:18:35,255 --> 07:18:35,688
OPPOSITION GROUPS. 

13623
07:18:35,688 --> 07:18:37,090
>> THE GLOVES ARE OFF AND THE 

13624
07:18:37,090 --> 07:18:38,759
DEMOCRATS ARE THE ENERGY -- 

13625
07:18:38,759 --> 07:18:39,059
ENEMY. 

13626
07:18:39,059 --> 07:18:41,461
>> REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY, SEE 

13627
07:18:41,461 --> 07:18:42,662
SECRETLY SOME SORT OF GANG 

13628
07:18:42,662 --> 07:18:46,433
LEADER IN AN UNDERGROUND GANG 

13629
07:18:46,433 --> 07:18:49,369
RAPE GROUP THAT WAS AVOIDED 

13630
07:18:49,369 --> 07:18:50,337
THAT HE EVADED THE FBI? 

13631
07:18:50,337 --> 07:18:53,507
OR IS HE AND IS A MAN GOING 

13632
07:18:53,507 --> 07:18:54,975
THROUGH A SMEAR CAMPAIGN? 

13633
07:18:54,975 --> 07:18:56,843
THE ANSWER IS MORE LIKELY 

13634
07:18:56,843 --> 07:18:57,644
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. 

13635
07:18:57,644 --> 07:18:59,179
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO STEP 

13636
07:18:59,179 --> 07:18:59,379
BACK. 

13637
07:18:59,379 --> 07:19:01,281
IS THIS A BIG DEMOCRATIC PLOT 

13638
07:19:01,281 --> 07:19:03,550
TO UNEARTH THIS, OR IS IT 

13639
07:19:03,550 --> 07:19:04,351
SOMETHING WITH A HANDSOME 

13640
07:19:04,351 --> 07:19:05,719
INFORMATION, MAYBE SHOULD HAVE 

13641
07:19:05,719 --> 07:19:07,754
GIVEN IT FORWARD A LITTLE 

13642
07:19:07,754 --> 07:19:09,689
EARLIER, BUT GAVE IT. 

13643
07:19:09,689 --> 07:19:10,923
THE SAME POINT FOR THE 

13644
07:19:10,923 --> 07:19:12,325
REPUBLICANS. 

13645
07:19:12,325 --> 07:19:13,627
WE MIGHT WANT TO OPEN AN FBI 

13646
07:19:13,627 --> 07:19:14,761
INVESTIGATION, BUT BASED ON THE 

13647
07:19:14,761 --> 07:19:16,129
TIMING, MAYBE IT DOESN'T MAKE 

13648
07:19:16,129 --> 07:19:19,833
SO MUCH'S SENSE. 

13649
07:19:19,833 --> 07:19:21,768
WE CANNOT FIT WITH THE OVERALL 

13650
07:19:21,768 --> 07:19:22,102
THEME IS. 

13651
07:19:22,102 --> 07:19:23,870
THIS IS THE SUPREME COURT. 

13652
07:19:23,870 --> 07:19:25,505
IF THIS DOES NOT GET SETTLED BY 

13653
07:19:25,505 --> 07:19:26,807
OCTOBER 1, WE HAVE A SUPREME 

13654
07:19:26,807 --> 07:19:27,540
COURT THAT COULD THEORETICALLY 

13655
07:19:27,540 --> 07:19:31,011
GO IN WITH EIGHT JUSTICES AND 

13656
07:19:31,011 --> 07:19:32,746
BE SPLIT ON SOME MAJOR 

13657
07:19:32,746 --> 07:19:36,049
DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. 

13658
07:19:36,049 --> 07:19:36,650
A 4-4 SPLIT. 

13659
07:19:36,650 --> 07:19:39,085
IT MEANS THAT THE LOWER COURT 

13660
07:19:39,085 --> 07:19:39,920
DECISION WILL BE UPHELD. 

13661
07:19:39,920 --> 07:19:41,354
THAT IS A DANGEROUS THING TO 

13662
07:19:41,354 --> 07:19:41,788
THINK ABOUT. 

13663
07:19:41,788 --> 07:19:42,889
WE NEED NINE JUSTICES ON THE 

13664
07:19:42,889 --> 07:19:44,423
SUPREME COURT ONE WAY OR THE 

13665
07:19:44,423 --> 07:19:46,226
OTHER. 

13666
07:19:46,226 --> 07:19:47,461
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE 

13667
07:19:47,461 --> 07:19:48,662
HAVING THE CONVERSATION NOW, AS 

13668
07:19:48,662 --> 07:19:50,464
OPPOSED TO LATER, BUT YOU CAN'T 

13669
07:19:50,464 --> 07:19:52,132
HELP BUT THINK, THAT IF HE DOES 

13670
07:19:52,132 --> 07:19:53,600
NOT GET CONFIRMED, WHAT WILL 

13671
07:19:53,600 --> 07:19:55,568
HAPPEN, REALISTICALLY, MOVING 

13672
07:19:55,568 --> 07:19:56,002
FORWARD. 

13673
07:19:56,002 --> 07:19:56,770
WE HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT 

13674
07:19:56,770 --> 07:19:57,903
MONTHS HUMMING FORWARD. 

13675
07:19:57,903 --> 07:20:03,810
>> I HAVE A CBSN POLITICAL 

13676
07:20:03,810 --> 07:20:04,310
CONTRIBUTOR DEMOCRATIC 

13677
07:20:04,310 --> 07:20:09,049
STRATEGIST. LINDA, WHAT YOU 

13678
07:20:09,049 --> 07:20:09,983
MAKE OF THE OPENING STATEMENTS? 

13679
07:20:09,983 --> 07:20:13,120
>> I WOULD AGREE WITH A LOT OF 

13680
07:20:13,120 --> 07:20:14,354
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

13681
07:20:14,354 --> 07:20:15,389
HERE JUST NOW ON THE PANEL. 

13682
07:20:15,389 --> 07:20:16,857
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SURPRISED US, I 

13683
07:20:16,857 --> 07:20:20,961
THINK, BY SHOWING A LEVEL OF 

13684
07:20:20,961 --> 07:20:21,995
EMOTION, THE INTENSITY AND THE 

13685
07:20:21,995 --> 07:20:24,030
DIRECT ATTACK ON DEMOCRATS. 

13686
07:20:24,030 --> 07:20:25,999
I WOULD SAY THAT SOME OF THE 

13687
07:20:25,999 --> 07:20:30,504
THINGS THAT TRANSPIRED JUST 

13688
07:20:30,504 --> 07:20:31,605
NOW, I DON'T THINK THEY ARE 

13689
07:20:31,605 --> 07:20:32,739
TERRIBLY HELPFUL TO HIM AS HE 

13690
07:20:32,739 --> 07:20:34,508
WAS PLAYING TO THE AUDIENCE OF 

13691
07:20:34,508 --> 07:20:35,775
ONE OF DONALD TRUMP. 

13692
07:20:35,775 --> 07:20:36,977
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THE WOMEN 

13693
07:20:36,977 --> 07:20:38,411
WHO WERE WATCHING AT HOME, THAT 

13694
07:20:38,411 --> 07:20:39,813
THE FEMALE SENATORS WHO WILL 

13695
07:20:39,813 --> 07:20:41,348
ULTIMATELY VOTE ON WHETHER NOT 

13696
07:20:41,348 --> 07:20:43,016
TO CONFIRM HIM THOUGHT THAT IT 

13697
07:20:43,016 --> 07:20:45,318
WAS HELPFUL TO SEE HIS EXCHANGE 

13698
07:20:45,318 --> 07:20:48,588
WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 

13699
07:20:48,588 --> 07:20:49,923
I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN LOST IN 

13700
07:20:49,923 --> 07:20:51,458
ALL OF THIS IS THAT, AT THE END 

13701
07:20:51,458 --> 07:20:53,259
OF THE DAY, THIS IS A JOB 

13702
07:20:53,259 --> 07:20:53,894
INTERVIEW. 

13703
07:20:53,894 --> 07:20:55,662
IT IS A JOB INTERVIEW THAT IS 

13704
07:20:55,662 --> 07:20:57,630
PLAYING OUT ON THE NATIONAL 

13705
07:20:57,630 --> 07:21:00,367
STAGE AND THE WORLD STAGE. 

13706
07:21:00,367 --> 07:21:01,801
BUT WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO, 

13707
07:21:01,801 --> 07:21:03,436
WHAT HE IS VYING FOR IS A JOB 

13708
07:21:03,436 --> 07:21:04,804
AS JUDGE FOR A LIFETIME ON THE 

13709
07:21:04,804 --> 07:21:05,171
SUPREME COURT. 

13710
07:21:05,171 --> 07:21:06,339
WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN 

13711
07:21:06,339 --> 07:21:07,840
DOING IS TRYING TO PRESENT A 

13712
07:21:07,840 --> 07:21:10,710
BALANCED SENSE. 

13713
07:21:10,710 --> 07:21:12,746
IF HE ENDS UP SEATED ON THE 

13714
07:21:12,746 --> 07:21:13,547
BENCH, AND THERE ARE 

13715
07:21:13,547 --> 07:21:14,915
PROGRESSIVE GROUPS THAT COME 

13716
07:21:14,915 --> 07:21:18,418
BEFORE HIM OR DEMOCRATIC CAUSES 

13717
07:21:18,418 --> 07:21:19,853
THAT COME BEFORE HIM, IT IS 

13718
07:21:19,853 --> 07:21:21,054
VERY CLEAR WHERE HE STANDS AND 

13719
07:21:21,054 --> 07:21:22,322
IT FEELS LIKE HE WILL BE 

13720
07:21:22,322 --> 07:21:23,222
HOLDING A GRUDGE. 

13721
07:21:23,222 --> 07:21:29,629
>> AT THIS POINT, WE KNOW WHERE 

13722
07:21:29,629 --> 07:21:30,931
HE STANDS WHEN IT COMES TO 

13723
07:21:30,931 --> 07:21:31,865
CERTAIN PARTISAN ISSUES, IF 

13724
07:21:31,865 --> 07:21:32,766
THERE WERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 

13725
07:21:32,766 --> 07:21:34,201
HOW HE WOULD VOTE ON SOME OF 

13726
07:21:34,201 --> 07:21:35,535
THE KEY CASES THAT WE ARE 

13727
07:21:35,535 --> 07:21:36,403
TALKING ABOUT THAT WILL COME 

13728
07:21:36,403 --> 07:21:37,437
DOWN TO THE 5-4 SPLIT. 

13729
07:21:37,437 --> 07:21:38,839
>> THAT IS THE KEY THING. 

13730
07:21:38,839 --> 07:21:39,573
WITH A WHOLE DIFFERENT 

13731
07:21:39,573 --> 07:21:40,373
CONVERSATION WEEKS AGO WHEN IT 

13732
07:21:40,373 --> 07:21:41,174
WAS CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 

13733
07:21:41,174 --> 07:21:42,275
I'D THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE 

13734
07:21:42,275 --> 07:21:43,310
MIGHT'VE GONE ABOUT IT, BUT 

13735
07:21:43,310 --> 07:21:44,978
WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS HIS 

13736
07:21:44,978 --> 07:21:48,348
CREDIBILITY AND QUALIFICATIONS 

13737
07:21:48,348 --> 07:21:49,516
TO BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT 

13738
07:21:49,516 --> 07:21:49,916
JUSTICE. 

13739
07:21:49,916 --> 07:21:50,917
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE, 

13740
07:21:50,917 --> 07:21:52,585
IT IS THE RIGHT CONVERSATION TO 

13741
07:21:52,585 --> 07:21:55,021
HAVE. 

13742
07:21:55,021 --> 07:21:56,323
WHY SHOULD HE SIT ON THE COURT? 

13743
07:21:56,323 --> 07:21:57,857
BUT HE DOES MAKE A GREAT POINT. 

13744
07:21:57,857 --> 07:21:59,292
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT A 

13745
07:21:59,292 --> 07:22:02,128
TRIAL, AND THERE IS NOTE JURY 

13746
07:22:02,128 --> 07:22:03,663
AND IT IS NOT ABOUT GUILT OR 

13747
07:22:03,663 --> 07:22:04,965
INNOCENCE, WE DO LIVE IN A LAND 

13748
07:22:04,965 --> 07:22:05,699
OF DUE PROCESS. 

13749
07:22:05,699 --> 07:22:06,800
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO BOTH 

13750
07:22:06,800 --> 07:22:08,234
SIDES, ESPECIALLY ON THE SAME 

13751
07:22:08,234 --> 07:22:08,635
DAY. 

13752
07:22:08,635 --> 07:22:09,903
THERE IS SOMETHING LOST HERE 

13753
07:22:09,903 --> 07:22:11,538
WHEN IT IS JUST ONE PERSON 

13754
07:22:11,538 --> 07:22:14,808
SAYING ONE THING AND ONE PERSON 

13755
07:22:14,808 --> 07:22:15,308
SAYING ANOTHER. 

13756
07:22:15,308 --> 07:22:16,710
>> THIS IS NOT A TRIAL, IT IS 

13757
07:22:16,710 --> 07:22:18,411
-- AN APPOINTMENT TO A VERY 

13758
07:22:18,411 --> 07:22:19,446
IMPORTANT JOB. 

13759
07:22:19,446 --> 07:22:22,516
WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT HOW IF 

13760
07:22:22,516 --> 07:22:27,020
HE LOSES THE JOB, HE'S GOING TO 

13761
07:22:27,020 --> 07:22:29,356
JAIL. 

13762
07:22:29,356 --> 07:22:30,156
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POSITION 

13763
07:22:30,156 --> 07:22:31,391
ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR LIFE, 

13764
07:22:31,391 --> 07:22:32,792
FOR WHOM THERE MAY BE BETTER 

13765
07:22:32,792 --> 07:22:33,426
CANDIDATES OUT THERE. 

13766
07:22:33,426 --> 07:22:34,828
>> ONE THING THAT I WILL ADD IS 

13767
07:22:34,828 --> 07:22:36,262
THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE AT 

13768
07:22:36,262 --> 07:22:36,495
STAKE. 

13769
07:22:36,495 --> 07:22:37,797
HE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

13770
07:22:37,797 --> 07:22:38,698
WHAT HIS LIFE IS. 

13771
07:22:38,698 --> 07:22:40,300
HE SAID I MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO 

13772
07:22:40,300 --> 07:22:41,334
TEACH AGAIN OR COACH AGAIN. 

13773
07:22:41,334 --> 07:22:42,869
BUT IF HE GOES BACK TO THE D.C. 

13774
07:22:42,869 --> 07:22:43,135
CIRCUIT. 

13775
07:22:43,135 --> 07:22:44,437
THERE HAS BEEN TALK THAT IF HE 

13776
07:22:44,437 --> 07:22:45,472
HAS BEEN LYING UNDER OATH, 

13777
07:22:45,472 --> 07:22:46,940
COULD HE BE POSSIBLY GROUNDS 

13778
07:22:46,940 --> 07:22:50,043
FOR IMPEACHMENT? 

13779
07:22:50,043 --> 07:22:51,344
THAT IS WAY TOO EARLY TO SAY, 

13780
07:22:51,344 --> 07:22:53,079
BUT IT IS A CONVERSATION PEOPLE 

13781
07:22:53,079 --> 07:22:53,480
ARE HAVING. 

13782
07:22:53,480 --> 07:22:54,614
>> YOU WOULD NEED AN FBI 

13783
07:22:54,614 --> 07:22:55,548
INVESTIGATION FOR THAT. 

13784
07:22:55,548 --> 07:23:00,387
>> THAT IS WHAT IT'S GOING FOR. 

13785
07:23:00,387 --> 07:23:01,721
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THIS JOB, 

13786
07:23:01,721 --> 07:23:03,289
IT'S THE OTHER ASPECTS OF HIS 

13787
07:23:03,289 --> 07:23:04,891
LIFE. 

13788
07:23:04,891 --> 07:23:06,126
IT IS THE BIGGEST JOB INTERVIEW 

13789
07:23:06,126 --> 07:23:07,527
OF HIS LIFE, BUT IT TOUCHES 

13790
07:23:07,527 --> 07:23:08,561
OTHER ASPECTS THAT HE NEVER 

13791
07:23:08,561 --> 07:23:09,362
IMAGINED HE ACCEPTED, YES, YOU 

13792
07:23:09,362 --> 07:23:11,197
CAN NOMINATE ME FOR THE SUPREME 

13793
07:23:11,197 --> 07:23:11,430
COURT. 

13794
07:23:11,430 --> 07:23:14,834
>> THAT IS THE SEVERITY OF IT. 

13795
07:23:14,834 --> 07:23:15,869
IT FEELS LIKE GUILTY UNTIL 

13796
07:23:15,869 --> 07:23:16,269
PROVEN INNOCENT. 

13797
07:23:16,269 --> 07:23:18,905
HE IS TO GO THROUGH AND SAY NO. 

13798
07:23:18,905 --> 07:23:20,306
HE WAS SHOWING CALENDARS AND 

13799
07:23:20,306 --> 07:23:22,375
SAYING I HAVE VERY GOOD 

13800
07:23:22,375 --> 07:23:28,114
DOCUMENTATION. 

13801
07:23:28,114 --> 07:23:29,649
IF THIS WAS A COURT CASE, YOU'D 

13802
07:23:29,649 --> 07:23:31,017
BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THAT AND 

13803
07:23:31,017 --> 07:23:33,286
IT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER 

13804
07:23:33,286 --> 07:23:34,054
INFORMATION. 

13805
07:23:34,054 --> 07:23:38,925
IT IS THE ABILITY TO COACH AND 

13806
07:23:38,925 --> 07:23:40,260
TEACH, AND OTHER THINGS. 

13807
07:23:40,260 --> 07:23:41,861
>> WE WILL SEE THAT MARK JUDGE 

13808
07:23:41,861 --> 07:23:43,897
HAS WRITTEN A BOOK THAT MAY 

13809
07:23:43,897 --> 07:23:45,532
PLACE HIM IN THE AREA, SO THERE 

13810
07:23:45,532 --> 07:23:47,133
ARE OTHER STORIES OUT THERE 

13811
07:23:47,133 --> 07:23:49,135
THAT COULD GET CLEARED UP IF HE 

13812
07:23:49,135 --> 07:23:54,641
CAME IN TO TESTIFY, OR IF THERE 

13813
07:23:54,641 --> 07:23:55,308
WAS AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

13814
07:23:55,308 --> 07:23:57,077
>> THAT IS WHY WE COME BACK TO 

13815
07:23:57,077 --> 07:23:58,278
SAY THERE IS NO REAL WINNER. 

13816
07:23:58,278 --> 07:23:58,912
WE PUSH THIS THROUGH. 

13817
07:23:58,912 --> 07:23:59,913
IF THEY RUSH IT THROUGH. 

13818
07:23:59,913 --> 07:24:00,814
THEY HAVE THE VOTE. 

13819
07:24:00,814 --> 07:24:02,549
IF HE DOES GET SEATED, THERE 

13820
07:24:02,549 --> 07:24:03,917
WILL STILL BE RAMIFICATIONS FOR 

13821
07:24:03,917 --> 07:24:05,952
THAT, BECAUSE THE LENS, AS ANY 

13822
07:24:05,952 --> 07:24:07,620
HUMAN, HE WILL SEE THINGS. 

13823
07:24:07,620 --> 07:24:09,723
PART OF THE LAST TESTIMONY 

13824
07:24:09,723 --> 07:24:13,259
SAYING THAT THE HOURS OF 

13825
07:24:13,259 --> 07:24:14,160
TESTIMONIES, I DON'T HAVE A 

13826
07:24:14,160 --> 07:24:18,031
PERSONAL AX TO GRIND. 

13827
07:24:18,031 --> 07:24:18,832
HOW CAN YOU REALISTICALLY SAY 

13828
07:24:18,832 --> 07:24:20,600
THAT AND JUST TURN THE PAGE, 

13829
07:24:20,600 --> 07:24:24,304
WHEN AMERICA HAS NOT TURNED THE 

13830
07:24:24,304 --> 07:24:24,504
PAGE. 

13831
07:24:24,504 --> 07:24:25,805
>> TO THAT NOTE, THIS OPENS UP 

13832
07:24:25,805 --> 07:24:26,806
SO MANY OTHER LAYERS NOW. 

13833
07:24:26,806 --> 07:24:28,441
FOR SENATORS TO DECIDE WHETHER 

13834
07:24:28,441 --> 07:24:29,375
TO CONFIRM HIM. 

13835
07:24:29,375 --> 07:24:33,113
IT IS NOT JUST WHETHER YOU 

13836
07:24:33,113 --> 07:24:33,813
BELIEVE THESE ALLEGATIONS, IT 

13837
07:24:33,813 --> 07:24:36,616
IS WHETHER YOU BELIEVE JUDGE 

13838
07:24:36,616 --> 07:24:39,319
KAVANAUGH IS NOT TOO PARTISAN 

13839
07:24:39,319 --> 07:24:42,589
FOR THE COURT. 

13840
07:24:42,589 --> 07:24:43,823
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT HE HAS THE 

13841
07:24:43,823 --> 07:24:45,258
CREDIBILITY TO STAND ON THE 

13842
07:24:45,258 --> 07:24:45,491
COURT. 

13843
07:24:45,491 --> 07:24:46,459
THERE SO MANY LAYERS NOW THAT 

13844
07:24:46,459 --> 07:24:47,160
HAVE OPENED UP. 

13845
07:24:47,160 --> 07:24:48,094
WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE 

13846
07:24:48,094 --> 07:24:51,998
HIM TALK ABOUT TRYING TO APPEAL 

13847
07:24:51,998 --> 07:24:54,334
TO SAY, IMAGINE YOUR HUSBAND, 

13848
07:24:54,334 --> 07:24:59,439
YOUR SON, KIND OF FLIP THE 

13849
07:24:59,439 --> 07:25:06,346
VICTIM CARD ON ITS HEAD WHEN 

13850
07:25:06,346 --> 07:25:07,447
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH 

13851
07:25:07,447 --> 07:25:08,381
THIS, SAY THINK ABOUT YOUR 

13852
07:25:08,381 --> 07:25:09,683
MOTHER OR YOUR SISTER, OR WOMEN 

13853
07:25:09,683 --> 07:25:10,216
IN YOUR LIFE. 

13854
07:25:10,216 --> 07:25:11,618
HE IS TRYING TO FLIP THAT ON 

13855
07:25:11,618 --> 07:25:12,152
ITS HEAD. 

13856
07:25:12,152 --> 07:25:13,086
WE WILL SEE. 

13857
07:25:13,086 --> 07:25:16,322
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE 

13858
07:25:16,322 --> 07:25:17,357
STRONGEST PARTS OF WHAT HE WAS 

13859
07:25:17,357 --> 07:25:18,591
SAYING, WE SHOW THE PERSONAL 

13860
07:25:18,591 --> 07:25:20,193
NATURE OF HOW ALL OF THIS HAS 

13861
07:25:20,193 --> 07:25:21,561
HAD ON HIS LIFE. 

13862
07:25:21,561 --> 07:25:25,598
I THINK HE CAME ACROSS LESS 

13863
07:25:25,598 --> 07:25:26,665
COMPELLING WHEN SENATOR 

13864
07:25:26,665 --> 07:25:31,538
FEINSTEIN WAS INTERVIEWING HIM. 

13865
07:25:31,538 --> 07:25:32,771
HE WAS COMBATIVE AND VERGING ON 

13866
07:25:32,771 --> 07:25:33,373
DISRESPECTFUL. 

13867
07:25:33,373 --> 07:25:34,174
IT WILL BE INTERESTING GOING 

13868
07:25:34,174 --> 07:25:36,209
FORWARD TO SEE IF HE CHALLENGE 

13869
07:25:36,209 --> 07:25:38,178
-- CHANNELS THE ANGER IN AN 

13870
07:25:38,178 --> 07:25:44,350
APPROPRIATE WAY OR OR, IF WHEN 

13871
07:25:44,350 --> 07:25:45,151
SPEAKING TO FEMALE SENATORS, 

13872
07:25:45,151 --> 07:25:45,952
THE OPTICS CHANGE. 

13873
07:25:45,952 --> 07:25:46,219
HIS TONE. 

13874
07:25:46,219 --> 07:25:51,491
IS ROLLING HIS EYES. 

13875
07:25:51,491 --> 07:25:52,458
I THINK ANYBODY IN THAT 

13876
07:25:52,458 --> 07:25:54,260
SITUATION, IT IS SO 

13877
07:25:54,260 --> 07:25:54,627
EXTRAORDINARY. 

13878
07:25:54,627 --> 07:26:02,836
WE CANNOT PUT ENOUGH OF A POINT 

13879
07:26:02,836 --> 07:26:03,269
ON THAT. 

13880
07:26:03,269 --> 07:26:04,037
HOW EXTRAORDINARY IT IS. 

13881
07:26:04,037 --> 07:26:04,370
SO PERSONAL. 

13882
07:26:04,370 --> 07:26:05,238
SUCH STRANGE THINGS WE'RE 

13883
07:26:05,238 --> 07:26:05,605
TALKING ABOUT. 

13884
07:26:05,605 --> 07:26:06,840
AND THE SENATORS, ESPECIALLY 

13885
07:26:06,840 --> 07:26:08,608
THE REPUBLICAN WHAT ON THE 

13886
07:26:08,608 --> 07:26:09,876
RIGHT, COULD YOU SOME 

13887
07:26:09,876 --> 07:26:13,780
SENSITIVITY TRAINING. 

13888
07:26:13,780 --> 07:26:15,014
THE BREAK THAT WE HAD, EVERY 

13889
07:26:15,014 --> 07:26:15,815
MAJOR CORPORATION HAS SOME SORT 

13890
07:26:15,815 --> 07:26:17,250
OF, LET'S GET WITH THE MODERN 

13891
07:26:17,250 --> 07:26:17,517
CENTURY. 

13892
07:26:17,517 --> 07:26:18,651
BUT I FEEL LIKE WHEN WE LISTEN 

13893
07:26:18,651 --> 07:26:20,086
TO THE SENATORS, WE'RE BACK IN 

13894
07:26:20,086 --> 07:26:20,486
THE 1800S. 

13895
07:26:20,486 --> 07:26:25,091
IT WOULD BEHOOVE US TO LEARN 

13896
07:26:25,091 --> 07:26:25,624
HOW TO COMMUNICATE. 

13897
07:26:25,624 --> 07:26:26,626
>> IT'S A NEXT ORDINARY 

13898
07:26:26,626 --> 07:26:27,627
AFTERNOON, BECAUSE WE LISTENING 

13899
07:26:27,627 --> 07:26:29,062
TO TWO PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO 

13900
07:26:29,062 --> 07:26:30,063
GENUINELY BELIEVE THERE STORIES 

13901
07:26:30,063 --> 07:26:30,263
100%. 

13902
07:26:30,263 --> 07:26:33,533
>> AND LET EVERYBODY STEP BACK 

13903
07:26:33,533 --> 07:26:34,534
AND IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE EITHER 

13904
07:26:34,534 --> 07:26:37,537
BRETT KAVANAUGH OR DR. FORD. 

13905
07:26:37,537 --> 07:26:38,471
FROM A REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE, 

13906
07:26:38,471 --> 07:26:39,973
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ACT UP 

13907
07:26:39,973 --> 07:26:40,206
THERE? 

13908
07:26:40,206 --> 07:26:41,207
YOU'RE GOING TO ACT THE WAY 

13909
07:26:41,207 --> 07:26:43,843
THAT HE IS ACTING, OR IF YOU 

13910
07:26:43,843 --> 07:26:45,278
THINK ABOUT HOW DR. FORD WAS 

13911
07:26:45,278 --> 07:26:46,279
ABLE TO GET THE STORY FORWARD 

13912
07:26:46,279 --> 07:26:50,350
AND PEOPLE WORSE OPTICAL OF 

13913
07:26:50,350 --> 07:26:51,384
THAT, SHE SPOKE TO HER FRIENDS 

13914
07:26:51,384 --> 07:26:53,186
OF THE BEACH AND HAD NO IDEA ON 

13915
07:26:53,186 --> 07:26:54,320
HOW TO GET THE LEGAL PROCESS 

13916
07:26:54,320 --> 07:26:54,621
GOING. 

13917
07:26:54,621 --> 07:26:55,855
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SOMEONE IN 

13918
07:26:55,855 --> 07:26:56,589
THAT POSITION WOULD DO. 

13919
07:26:56,589 --> 07:26:57,891
>> I'M GOING TO POINT OUT THAT 

13920
07:26:57,891 --> 07:26:58,925
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS SAT BACK 

13921
07:26:58,925 --> 07:26:59,125
DOWN. 

13922
07:26:59,125 --> 07:27:00,226
THE QUESTION WILL RESUME. 

13923
07:27:00,226 --> 07:27:25,919
SO LET'S LISTEN IN. 

13924
07:27:25,919 --> 07:27:27,520
>> SENATOR LEAHY.  

13925
07:27:27,520 --> 07:27:32,325
>> JUDGE, YOU SAID BEFORE, THAT 

13926
07:27:32,325 --> 07:27:33,660
MARK JUDGE WAS A CLOSE FRIEND 

13927
07:27:33,660 --> 07:27:34,960
OF YOURS IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

13928
07:27:34,960 --> 07:27:37,730
NOW, DR. FORD, AS YOU KNOW, HAS 

13929
07:27:37,730 --> 07:27:41,467
SAID THAT HE WAS IN THE ROOM 

13930
07:27:41,467 --> 07:27:42,201
WHEN SHE WAS ATTACKED. 

13931
07:27:42,201 --> 07:27:43,836
SHE ALSO SAID THAT YOU ARE AS 

13932
07:27:43,836 --> 07:27:45,605
WELL. 

13933
07:27:45,605 --> 07:27:46,439
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FBI HAS 

13934
07:27:46,439 --> 07:27:49,075
NEVER INTERVIEWED HIM. 

13935
07:27:49,075 --> 07:27:51,511
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE 

13936
07:27:51,511 --> 07:27:55,014
HIS ATTENDANCE HERE. 

13937
07:27:55,014 --> 07:27:57,617
THE CHAIRMAN REFUSES TO CALL 

13938
07:27:57,617 --> 07:28:04,123
HIM. 

13939
07:28:04,123 --> 07:28:05,158
IF SHE SAYING THAT MARK JUDGE 

13940
07:28:05,158 --> 07:28:06,793
WAS IN THE ROOM THEN, HE SHOULD 

13941
07:28:06,793 --> 07:28:07,794
BE IN THE ROOM HERE TODAY. 

13942
07:28:07,794 --> 07:28:11,030
WOULD YOU WANT HIM CALLED AS A 

13943
07:28:11,030 --> 07:28:13,900
WITNESS? 

13944
07:28:13,900 --> 07:28:17,804
>> SENATOR, THIS ALLEGATION 

13945
07:28:17,804 --> 07:28:19,071
CAME INTO THE COMMITTEE? 

13946
07:28:19,071 --> 07:28:23,810
>> I'M JUST ASKING THE 

13947
07:28:23,810 --> 07:28:24,077
QUESTION. 

13948
07:28:24,077 --> 07:28:25,311
WOULD LIKE HIM TO BE AS A 

13949
07:28:25,311 --> 07:28:25,577
WITNESS? 

13950
07:28:25,577 --> 07:28:27,013
>> HE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED 

13951
07:28:27,013 --> 07:28:30,483
SWORN TESTIMONY. 

13952
07:28:30,483 --> 07:28:31,750
>> IT HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED 

13953
07:28:31,750 --> 07:28:33,086
BY THE FBI. 

13954
07:28:33,086 --> 07:28:34,153
THE COMMITTEE HAS REFUSED TO 

13955
07:28:34,153 --> 07:28:35,021
ALLOW TO BE. 

13956
07:28:35,021 --> 07:28:38,858
>> IT WAS DROPPED ON ME. 

13957
07:28:38,858 --> 07:28:39,258
WAS FROM. 

13958
07:28:39,258 --> 07:28:40,293
>> IT WAS CONFISCATED BY THE 

13959
07:28:40,293 --> 07:28:40,493
FBI. 

13960
07:28:40,493 --> 07:28:44,364
IT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED. 

13961
07:28:44,364 --> 07:28:45,565
>> IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENED 

13962
07:28:45,565 --> 07:28:46,366
IN DUE COURSE, SENATOR. 

13963
07:28:46,366 --> 07:28:47,400
WHEN IT CAME IN. 

13964
07:28:47,400 --> 07:28:48,634
>> I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT. 

13965
07:28:48,634 --> 07:28:50,236
I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR 

13966
07:28:50,236 --> 07:28:50,970
44 YEARS. 

13967
07:28:50,970 --> 07:28:53,973
WITH BOTH PUBLICANS AND GRASS. 

13968
07:28:53,973 --> 07:28:55,008
NEVER SEEN ANYONE THAT CRITICAL 

13969
07:28:55,008 --> 07:29:03,182
AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE CALLED 

13970
07:29:03,182 --> 07:29:03,416
 

13971
07:29:03,416 --> 07:29:03,649
MONEY. 

13972
07:29:03,649 --> 07:29:05,084
>> HE HAS PROVIDED SWORN 

13973
07:29:05,084 --> 07:29:07,420
TESTIMONY. 

13974
07:29:07,420 --> 07:29:09,589
THE ALLEGATION CAME IN WEEKS 

13975
07:29:09,589 --> 07:29:10,256
AGO. 

13976
07:29:10,256 --> 07:29:14,827
NOTHING WAS DONE WITH IT I THE 

13977
07:29:14,827 --> 07:29:15,328
RANKING MEMBER. 

13978
07:29:15,328 --> 07:29:16,462
THAN IT WAS FROM ON ME. 

13979
07:29:16,462 --> 07:29:18,765
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I HAVE 

13980
07:29:18,765 --> 07:29:19,999
HEARD YOUR LINE AND YOU HAVE 

13981
07:29:19,999 --> 07:29:21,100
STATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

13982
07:29:21,100 --> 07:29:23,703
BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS, HE 

13983
07:29:23,703 --> 07:29:28,007
AUTHORED A BOOK TITLED "WASTED, 

13984
07:29:28,007 --> 07:29:32,412
TALES OF A X DRUNK." 

13985
07:29:32,412 --> 07:29:36,849
HE MENTIONS SOMEONE NAMED 

13986
07:29:36,849 --> 07:29:37,149
KAVANAUGH. 

13987
07:29:37,149 --> 07:29:38,151
IS THAT YOU HE IS TALKING 

13988
07:29:38,151 --> 07:29:38,384
ABOUT? 

13989
07:29:38,384 --> 07:29:41,587
>>  SENATOR, MARK JUDGE -- 

13990
07:29:41,587 --> 07:29:45,658
>> IS THAT YOU THAT HE WAS 

13991
07:29:45,658 --> 07:29:46,025
TALKING ABOUT? 

13992
07:29:46,025 --> 07:29:50,963
>> IF YOU WILL LET ME PROCEED. 

13993
07:29:50,963 --> 07:29:52,398
MARK JUDGE WAS A FRIEND OF OURS 

13994
07:29:52,398 --> 07:29:53,099
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

13995
07:29:53,099 --> 07:29:54,567
HE DEVELOPED A VERY SERIOUS 

13996
07:29:54,567 --> 07:29:56,102
TRICKING PROBLEM. 

13997
07:29:56,102 --> 07:29:57,236
AN ADDICTION PROBLEM. 

13998
07:29:57,236 --> 07:30:00,273
IT LASTED DECADES AND WAS VERY 

13999
07:30:00,273 --> 07:30:01,574
DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO ESCAPE 

14000
07:30:01,574 --> 07:30:04,444
FROM. 

14001
07:30:04,444 --> 07:30:05,711
HE NEARLY DIED. 

14002
07:30:05,711 --> 07:30:08,715
THEN HE HAD LEUKEMIA AS WELL ON 

14003
07:30:08,715 --> 07:30:09,682
TOP OF THAT. 

14004
07:30:09,682 --> 07:30:13,719
NOW, AS PART OF HIS THERAPY AND 

14005
07:30:13,719 --> 07:30:14,921
PART OF HIS COMING TO GRIPS 

14006
07:30:14,921 --> 07:30:16,589
WITH SOBRIETY, HE WROTE A BOOK. 

14007
07:30:16,589 --> 07:30:19,892
IT IS A FICTIONALIZED BOOK AND 

14008
07:30:19,892 --> 07:30:22,695
AN ACCOUNT. I THINK YOU PICKED 

14009
07:30:22,695 --> 07:30:24,263
OUT NAMES OF FRIENDS OF OURS TO 

14010
07:30:24,263 --> 07:30:28,534
THROW THE MEN AS CLOSE TO FOUR 

14011
07:30:28,534 --> 07:30:36,042
CHARACTERS IN THE GROUP BOOK. 

14012
07:30:36,042 --> 07:30:37,243
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT 

14013
07:30:37,243 --> 07:30:37,877
IS YOU ARE NOT. 

14014
07:30:37,877 --> 07:30:39,278
>> WE CAN SAY THERE AND MAKE 

14015
07:30:39,278 --> 07:30:40,913
FUN OF SOME GUY WHO HAS AN 

14016
07:30:40,913 --> 07:30:41,714
ADDICTION, BUT I DON'T THINK 

14017
07:30:41,714 --> 07:30:42,548
THAT MAKES -- 

14018
07:30:42,548 --> 07:30:43,749
>> I'M TRYING TO GET A STRAIGHT 

14019
07:30:43,749 --> 07:30:45,318
ANSWER FROM YOU UNDER OATH. 

14020
07:30:45,318 --> 07:30:50,289
ARE YOU THE BARGE KAVANAUGH 

14021
07:30:50,289 --> 07:30:51,691
THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO . 

14022
07:30:51,691 --> 07:30:54,360
>> YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM. 

14023
07:30:54,360 --> 07:30:58,231
>> I AGREE WITH YOU THERE. 

14024
07:30:58,231 --> 07:30:59,332
THAT'S WHY WAS THE CHAIRMAN HAD 

14025
07:30:59,332 --> 07:31:00,133
HIM HERE UNDER OATH. 

14026
07:31:00,133 --> 07:31:03,302
YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR YEARBOOK. 

14027
07:31:03,302 --> 07:31:06,305
IN YOUR YEARBOOK, YOU TALKED 

14028
07:31:06,305 --> 07:31:10,542
ABOUT DRINKING AND SEXUAL 

14029
07:31:10,542 --> 07:31:11,911
EXPLOITS, DID YOU NOT? 

14030
07:31:11,911 --> 07:31:15,848
>> SENATOR, LET ME TAKE A STEP 

14031
07:31:15,848 --> 07:31:20,920
BACK AND EXPLAIN HIGH SCHOOL. 

14032
07:31:20,920 --> 07:31:24,090
I WAS NUMBER 1 IN THE CLASS. 

14033
07:31:24,090 --> 07:31:26,993
>> THAT IS OTHER. 

14034
07:31:26,993 --> 07:31:27,860
>> NO. 

14035
07:31:27,860 --> 07:31:29,629
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY HIGH 

14036
07:31:29,629 --> 07:31:30,096
SCHOOL. 

14037
07:31:30,096 --> 07:31:30,496
NO! 

14038
07:31:30,496 --> 07:31:32,932
>> LET HIM ANSWER. 

14039
07:31:32,932 --> 07:31:34,367
>> I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY 

14040
07:31:34,367 --> 07:31:36,102
HIGH SCHOOL RECORD IF YOU'RE 

14041
07:31:36,102 --> 07:31:36,602
GOING TO MOCK ME. 

14042
07:31:36,602 --> 07:31:41,039
>> I THINK WE WERE ARE -- ALL 

14043
07:31:41,039 --> 07:31:46,913
VERY GENEROUS WITH DOCTOR FOR. 

14044
07:31:46,913 --> 07:31:48,581
>> I BUSTED MY BUTT WITH 

14045
07:31:48,581 --> 07:31:49,982
ACADEMICS. 

14046
07:31:49,982 --> 07:31:50,983
I FINISHED NUMBER 1 IN THE 

14047
07:31:50,983 --> 07:31:51,751
CLASS. 

14048
07:31:51,751 --> 07:31:56,088
FRESHMAN AND JUNIOR YEAR, I WAS 

14049
07:31:56,088 --> 07:31:59,859
ALWAYS UP AT THE TOP. 

14050
07:31:59,859 --> 07:32:00,660
I PLAYED SPORTS. 

14051
07:32:00,660 --> 07:32:01,694
I WAS CAPTAIN OF THE VARSITY 

14052
07:32:01,694 --> 07:32:02,562
BASKETBALL TEAM. 

14053
07:32:02,562 --> 07:32:04,463
I WAS WIDE RECEIVER AND

TEAM. 

14056
07:32:06,299 --> 07:32:08,701
I RAN TRACK IN THE SPRING OF 82 

14057
07:32:08,701 --> 07:32:13,439
TO GET FASTER. 

14058
07:32:13,439 --> 07:32:14,340
I DID MY SERVICE PROJECTS AT 

14059
07:32:14,340 --> 07:32:14,874
THE SCHOOL. 

14060
07:32:14,874 --> 07:32:15,975
IT INVOLVES GOING TO THE SOUP 

14061
07:32:15,975 --> 07:32:16,375
KITCHEN DOWNTOWN. 

14062
07:32:16,375 --> 07:32:17,009
LET ME FINISH. 

14063
07:32:17,009 --> 07:32:18,778

14067
07:32:23,683 --> 07:32:25,451
YES, WE GOT TOGETHER WITH OUR 

14068
07:32:25,451 --> 07:32:25,918
FRIENDS. 

14069
07:32:25,918 --> 07:32:27,954
>> DOES THIS REFLECT WHO YOU 

14070
07:32:27,954 --> 07:32:28,187
ARE? 

14071
07:32:28,187 --> 07:32:31,457
DOES THIS YEARBOOK REFLECT YOUR 

14072
07:32:31,457 --> 07:32:33,226
FOCUS ON ACADEMICS AND RESPECT 

14073
07:32:33,226 --> 07:32:33,693
FOR WOMEN? 

14074
07:32:33,693 --> 07:32:34,927
THIS IS EASY. 

14075
07:32:34,927 --> 07:32:36,929
YES OR NO. 

14076
07:32:36,929 --> 07:32:42,001
DOES THIS REFLECT YOUR FOCUS? 

14077
07:32:42,001 --> 07:32:43,002
>> ALREADY SAID IN MY OPENING 

14078
07:32:43,002 --> 07:32:43,335
STATEMENT. 

14079
07:32:43,335 --> 07:32:44,570

HE HAS ASKED THE QUESTION, I 

14081
07:32:46,272 --> 07:32:49,275
WILL GIVE YOU TIME TO ANSWER. 

14082
07:32:49,275 --> 07:32:50,810
>> YEARBOOK, AS I SAID IN MY 

14083
07:32:50,810 --> 07:32:51,410
OPENING STATEMENT, WAS 

14084
07:32:51,410 --> 07:32:53,079
SOMETHING WHERE THE STUDENTS 

14085
07:32:53,079 --> 07:32:57,216
AND EDITORS MADE A DECISION TO 

14086
07:32:57,216 --> 07:33:01,587
TREAT SOME OF IT AS FAR AS AND 

14087
07:33:01,587 --> 07:33:02,554
SOME OF IT AS EXAGGERATION, 

14088
07:33:02,554 --> 07:33:03,656
SOME OF THE CELEBRATING THINGS 

14089
07:33:03,656 --> 07:33:05,458
THAT DO NOT REFLECT THE CENTRAL 

14090
07:33:05,458 --> 07:33:06,692
PART OF OUR SCHOOL. 

14091
07:33:06,692 --> 07:33:09,228
YES, WE WENT TO PARTIES. 

14092
07:33:09,228 --> 07:33:12,898
OF COURSE, WE WENT TO PARTIES. 

14093
07:33:12,898 --> 07:33:13,498
THE YEARBOOK PAGE DESCRIBES 

14094
07:33:13,498 --> 07:33:16,736
THAT AND MAKES FUN OF IT. 

14095
07:33:16,736 --> 07:33:18,337
IF WE WANTED TO SIT HERE AND 

14096
07:33:18,337 --> 07:33:19,138
TALK ABOUT WHETHER A SUPREME 

14097
07:33:19,138 --> 07:33:19,939
COURT NOMINATION SHOULD BE 

14098
07:33:19,939 --> 07:33:21,706
BASED ON A HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK 

14099
07:33:21,706 --> 07:33:26,646
PAGE, THAT IS TAKING US TO A 

14100
07:33:26,646 --> 07:33:27,813
NEW LEVEL OF ABSURDITY. 

14101
07:33:27,813 --> 07:33:32,451

07:39:04,683 --> 07:39:08,320
CHARGES. 

14249
07:39:08,320 --> 07:39:09,788
WE KNOW, AND I'M SURE SHE HAS 

14250
07:39:09,788 --> 07:39:10,789
BEEN ADVISED BY HER ATTORNEYS, 

14251
07:39:10,789 --> 07:39:12,191
THAT A PERSON LYING TO THE FBI 

14252
07:39:12,191 --> 07:39:13,025
CAN FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. 

14253
07:39:13,025 --> 07:39:13,826
YOU HAVE CLEARLY AND 

14254
07:39:13,826 --> 07:39:14,927
UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED THE YOU 

14255
07:39:14,927 --> 07:39:17,496
ASSAULTED DR. FORD. 

14256
07:39:17,496 --> 07:39:18,764
WITH THAT STATEMENT, YOU MUST 

14257
07:39:18,764 --> 07:39:21,267
BELIEVE, THAT THERE IS NO 

14258
07:39:21,267 --> 07:39:21,967
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OR ANY 

14259
07:39:21,967 --> 07:39:23,435
CREDIBLE WITNESS THAT CAN PROVE 

14260
07:39:23,435 --> 07:39:24,803
OTHERWISE. 

14261
07:39:24,803 --> 07:39:27,406
YOU STARTED OFF WITH AN 

14262
07:39:27,406 --> 07:39:28,440
IMPASSIONED STATEMENT AT THE 

14263
07:39:28,440 --> 07:39:29,241
BEGINNING. 

14264
07:39:29,241 --> 07:39:33,679
I CAN IMAGINE, TRY TO IMAGINE, 

14265
07:39:33,679 --> 07:39:34,713
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND 

14266
07:39:34,713 --> 07:39:36,048
YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH. 

14267
07:39:36,048 --> 07:39:37,249
I'M SURE WOULD NOT GET CLOSE TO 

14268
07:39:37,249 --> 07:39:37,449
IT. 

14269
07:39:37,449 --> 07:39:38,384
>> YOU WOULD NOT. 

14270
07:39:38,384 --> 07:39:39,385
>> I'M SURE I WOULD NOT. 

14271
07:39:39,385 --> 07:39:41,386
IN THE COURSE OF IT, HE SAID, I 

14272
07:39:41,386 --> 07:39:43,288
WELCOME ANY KIND OF 

14273
07:39:43,288 --> 07:39:44,189
INVESTIGATION. 

14274
07:39:44,189 --> 07:39:46,025
I QUOTE YOU. 

14275
07:39:46,025 --> 07:39:48,160
I WELCOME ANY KIND OF 

14276
07:39:48,160 --> 07:39:48,661
INVESTIGATION. 

14277
07:39:48,661 --> 07:39:50,696
I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR YOU. 

14278
07:39:50,696 --> 07:39:51,297
RIGHT NOW. 

14279
07:39:51,297 --> 07:39:53,499
TURN TO YOUR LEFT AND THE FRONT 

14280
07:39:53,499 --> 07:39:58,070
ROW, TO DON McGAHN, COUNSEL TO 

14281
07:39:58,070 --> 07:39:59,872
PRESIDENT TRUMP, ASK HIM TO 

14282
07:39:59,872 --> 07:40:00,939
SUSPEND THE HEARING AND 

14283
07:40:00,939 --> 07:40:02,341
NOMINATION PROCESS UNTIL THE 

14284
07:40:02,341 --> 07:40:05,077
FBI COMPLETES ITS INVESTIGATION 

14285
07:40:05,077 --> 07:40:07,012
OF THE CHARGES MADE BY DR. FORD 

14286
07:40:07,012 --> 07:40:09,949
AND OTHERS AND GO TO BRING THE 

14287
07:40:09,949 --> 07:40:10,916
WITNESSES FORWARD AND PROVIDE 

14288
07:40:10,916 --> 07:40:15,354
THE INFORMATION TO THE HEARING. 

14289
07:40:15,354 --> 07:40:16,789
I AM SURE THAT THE CHAIRMAN AT 

14290
07:40:16,789 --> 07:40:17,423
THAT POINT, WILL UNDERSTAND 

14291
07:40:17,423 --> 07:40:18,990
THAT THAT IS A REASONABLE 

14292
07:40:18,990 --> 07:40:20,826
REQUEST. TO FINALLY PUT TO REST 

14293
07:40:20,826 --> 07:40:23,195
THESE CHARGES, IF THEY ARE 

14294
07:40:23,195 --> 07:40:24,630
FALSE, OR TO PROVE THEM IF THEY 

14295
07:40:24,630 --> 07:40:25,130
ARE NOT. 

14296
07:40:25,130 --> 07:40:26,899
YOU SPENT 2 YEARS IN THE WHITE 

14297
07:40:26,899 --> 07:40:29,301
HOUSE OFFICE THAT APPROVED 

14298
07:40:29,301 --> 07:40:30,135
JUDICIAL NOMINEES. 

14299
07:40:30,135 --> 07:40:32,404
YOU TURNED TO THE FBI OVER AND 

14300
07:40:32,404 --> 07:40:33,872
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THEIR 

14301
07:40:33,872 --> 07:40:34,907
WORK. 

14302
07:40:34,907 --> 07:40:36,075
LET'S BRING THEM IN HERE AND 

14303
07:40:36,075 --> 07:40:36,275
NOW. 

14304
07:40:36,275 --> 07:40:38,911
TURNED TO DON McGAHN AND TELL 

14305
07:40:38,911 --> 07:40:40,779
HIM, IT IS TIME TO GET THIS 

14306
07:40:40,779 --> 07:40:42,981
DONE. 

14307
07:40:42,981 --> 07:40:44,183
IN FBI INVESTIGATION IS THE 

14308
07:40:44,183 --> 07:40:45,617
ONLY WAY TO ANSWER SOME OF 

14309
07:40:45,617 --> 07:40:46,017
THESE QUESTIONS. 

14310
07:40:46,017 --> 07:40:49,288
>> STOP THE CLOCK. 

14311
07:40:49,288 --> 07:40:50,756
THIS COMMITTEE IS RUNNING THIS 

14312
07:40:50,756 --> 07:40:51,323
HEARING. 

14313
07:40:51,323 --> 07:40:54,560
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT DON 

14314
07:40:54,560 --> 07:40:58,497
McGAHN, NOT EVEN YOU AS THE 

14315
07:40:58,497 --> 07:40:59,665
NOMINEE. 

14316
07:40:59,665 --> 07:41:02,934
WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE DR. 

14317
07:41:02,934 --> 07:41:05,871
FORD ASKED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY 

14318
07:41:05,871 --> 07:41:08,340
HERE. 

14319
07:41:08,340 --> 07:41:09,575
I KNOW YOU DID AS WELL. 

14320
07:41:09,575 --> 07:41:10,809
EFFECT, MAYBE EVEN BEFORE SHE 

14321
07:41:10,809 --> 07:41:11,009
DID. 

14322
07:41:11,009 --> 07:41:12,211
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE 

14323
07:41:12,211 --> 07:41:14,813
WANTED TO BE HEARD FROM CHARGES 

14324
07:41:14,813 --> 07:41:16,915
THAT THEY ALL THOUGHT WERE 

14325
07:41:16,915 --> 07:41:17,449
UNFAIR. 

14326
07:41:17,449 --> 07:41:19,118
OR ACTIVITIES, LIKE SEXUAL 

14327
07:41:19,118 --> 07:41:20,953
ASSAULT, WAS UNFAIR. 

14328
07:41:20,953 --> 07:41:24,623
SO I WANT TO ASSURE SENATOR 

14329
07:41:24,623 --> 07:41:26,925
DURBIN, REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU 

14330
07:41:26,925 --> 07:41:28,394
SAY TO SENATOR DON McGAHN, 

14331
07:41:28,394 --> 07:41:30,596
WE'RE NOT SUSPENDING THIS 

14332
07:41:30,596 --> 07:41:31,964
HEARING. 

14333
07:41:31,964 --> 07:41:37,035
PROCEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

14334
07:41:37,035 --> 07:41:38,570
>> I WILL JUST SAY THIS. 

14335
07:41:38,570 --> 07:41:42,207
IF YOU, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, TURNED 

14336
07:41:42,207 --> 07:41:44,108
TO DON McGAHN AND TO THE 

14337
07:41:44,108 --> 07:41:50,482
COMMITTEE AND SAY, FOR THE SAKE 

14338
07:41:50,482 --> 07:41:51,517
OF MY REPUTATION, MY FAMILY 

14339
07:41:51,517 --> 07:41:52,851
NAME, AND TO GET TO THE BOTTOM 

14340
07:41:52,851 --> 07:41:54,486
OF THE TRUTH OF THIS, I'M NOT 

14341
07:41:54,486 --> 07:41:55,888
GOING TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO AN 

14342
07:41:55,888 --> 07:41:56,355
FBI INVESTIGATION. 

14343
07:41:56,355 --> 07:41:57,556
I WOULD HOPE THAT ALL MEMBERS 

14344
07:41:57,556 --> 07:41:58,557
OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD JOIN ME 

14345
07:41:58,557 --> 07:42:00,225
IN SAYING THAT WE WOULD ABIDE 

14346
07:42:00,225 --> 07:42:01,293
BY YOUR WISHES AND HAVE THE 

14347
07:42:01,293 --> 07:42:01,660
INVESTIGATION. 

14348
07:42:01,660 --> 07:42:02,628
>> I WELCOME WHATEVER THE 

14349
07:42:02,628 --> 07:42:04,463
COMMITTEE WANTS TO DO. 

14350
07:42:04,463 --> 07:42:05,464
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. 

14351
07:42:05,464 --> 07:42:10,235
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE 

14352
07:42:10,235 --> 07:42:10,802
DOING. 

14353
07:42:10,802 --> 07:42:12,337
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT 

14354
07:42:12,337 --> 07:42:12,738
TO DO. 

14355
07:42:12,738 --> 07:42:13,572
>> I AM INNOCENT. 

14356
07:42:13,572 --> 07:42:14,673
I'M INNOCENT OF THE CHARGE. 

14357
07:42:14,673 --> 07:42:15,808
>> YOU WANT THE FBI 

14358
07:42:15,808 --> 07:42:16,175
INVESTIGATION? 

14359
07:42:16,175 --> 07:42:18,644
>> THEY DON'T COME TO 

14360
07:42:18,644 --> 07:42:18,977
CONCLUSIONS. 

14361
07:42:18,977 --> 07:42:20,279
>> YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH 

14362
07:42:20,279 --> 07:42:20,479
WAYS. 

14363
07:42:20,479 --> 07:42:22,314
YOU CANNOT SAY IT THE BEGINNING 

14364
07:42:22,314 --> 07:42:27,519
SAY THAT YOU WELCOME ANY KIND OF

14365
07:42:27,519 --> 07:42:27,986
INVESTIGATION. 

14366
07:42:27,986 --> 07:42:29,521
>> THIS THING WAS SPRUNG ON ME. 

14367
07:42:29,521 --> 07:42:30,656
IT WAS FUN AT THE LAST MINUTE 

14368
07:42:30,656 --> 07:42:32,224
AFTER BEING HELD BY STAFF. 

14369
07:42:32,224 --> 07:42:34,726
YOU KNOW. 

14370
07:42:34,726 --> 07:42:35,527
I CALLED FOR HEARING 

14371
07:42:35,527 --> 07:42:35,860
IMMEDIATELY. 

14372
07:42:35,860 --> 07:42:37,563
>> IF THERE IS NO TRUTH TO HER 

14373
07:42:37,563 --> 07:42:38,931
CHARGES, THE FBI INVESTIGATION 

14374
07:42:38,931 --> 07:42:40,299
WILL SHOW THAT. 

14375
07:42:40,299 --> 07:42:41,900
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT 

14376
07:42:41,900 --> 07:42:43,869
NOT? 

14377
07:42:43,869 --> 07:42:44,469
>> COME ON. 

14378
07:42:44,469 --> 07:42:48,106
>> THE FBI DOES NOT REACH 

14379
07:42:48,106 --> 07:42:48,439
CONCLUSIONS. 

14380
07:42:48,439 --> 07:42:48,907
YOU KNOW THAT. 

14381
07:42:48,907 --> 07:42:50,342
YOU KNOW THAT IS A PHONY 

14382
07:42:50,342 --> 07:42:50,609
QUESTION. 

14383
07:42:50,609 --> 07:42:51,543
THE FBI DOES NOT REACH 

14384
07:42:51,543 --> 07:42:52,944
CONCLUSIONS, THE JUST PROVIDE A 

14385
07:42:52,944 --> 07:42:53,979
302. 

14386
07:42:53,979 --> 07:42:55,013
SOMETIMES WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO 

14387
07:42:55,013 --> 07:42:56,448
DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT IS, THEY 

14388
07:42:56,448 --> 07:42:58,450
JUST GO AND DO WHAT YOU ARE 

14389
07:42:58,450 --> 07:42:58,683
DOING. 

14390
07:42:58,683 --> 07:42:59,484
ASKED QUESTIONS AND THEN TYPE 

14391
07:42:59,484 --> 07:43:05,190
UP A REPORT. 

14392
07:43:05,190 --> 07:43:06,625
THEY DO NOT REACH THE BOTTOM 

14393
07:43:06,625 --> 07:43:06,825
LINE. 

14394
07:43:06,825 --> 07:43:08,026
>> I ASKED DR. FORD, ASKED 

14395
07:43:08,026 --> 07:43:09,061
ABOUT THIS INCIDENT WHERE SHE 

14396
07:43:09,061 --> 07:43:10,162
RAN INTO MARK JUDGE AT SAFEWAY. 

14397
07:43:10,162 --> 07:43:11,163
SHE SAID, SURE, I REMEMBER. 

14398
07:43:11,163 --> 07:43:12,698
IT WAS SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AFTER 

14399
07:43:12,698 --> 07:43:13,098
THE OCCURRENCE. 

14400
07:43:13,098 --> 07:43:13,932
SOMEONE AT THE WASHINGTON POST 

14401
07:43:13,932 --> 07:43:15,967
TOOK A LOOK AT HIS BOOK AND WAS 

14402
07:43:15,967 --> 07:43:20,172
ABLE TO SELECT WHAT HE WROTE 

14403
07:43:20,172 --> 07:43:21,206
ABOUT HIS ADDICTION AND 

14404
07:43:21,206 --> 07:43:21,607
ALCOHOLISM. 

14405
07:43:21,607 --> 07:43:22,441
THEY'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO 

14406
07:43:22,441 --> 07:43:24,243
WHAT THEY THINK IS A PERIOD OF 

14407
07:43:24,243 --> 07:43:24,443
TIME. 

14408
07:43:24,443 --> 07:43:25,877
SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AFTER THE 

14409
07:43:25,877 --> 07:43:27,713
EVENT. 

14410
07:43:27,713 --> 07:43:29,014
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING AT 

14411
07:43:29,014 --> 07:43:32,384
THE SAFEWAY AT THAT POINT. 

14412
07:43:32,384 --> 07:43:33,619
THE POINT I'M GETTING TO, IS 

14413
07:43:33,619 --> 07:43:35,120
THAT WE CAN CONNECT SOME DOTS 

14414
07:43:35,120 --> 07:43:35,854
HERE AND GET SOME INFORMATION. 

14415
07:43:35,854 --> 07:43:44,997
WHY WOULD YOU RESIST THAT KIND 

14416
07:43:44,997 --> 07:43:45,397
OF INVESTIGATION? 

14417
07:43:45,397 --> 07:43:45,797
>> DOTS. 

14418
07:43:45,797 --> 07:43:46,932
>> WHY WOULD YOU RESIST THE 

14419
07:43:46,932 --> 07:43:47,733
KIND OF INVESTIGATION? 

14420
07:43:47,733 --> 07:43:48,667
>> I WANTED THE HEARING LAST 

14421
07:43:48,667 --> 07:43:49,067
WEEK. 

14422
07:43:49,067 --> 07:43:50,202

INVESTIGATION. 

14424
07:43:50,569 --> 07:43:51,503
>> THE COMMITTEE FIGURES OUT 

14425
07:43:51,503 --> 07:43:52,270
HOW TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. 

14426
07:43:52,270 --> 07:43:52,905
I'LL DO WHATEVER. 

14427
07:43:52,905 --> 07:43:54,773
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH 

14428
07:43:54,773 --> 07:43:55,206
COMMITTEE COUNSEL. 

14429
07:43:55,206 --> 07:43:57,142
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WILL YOU 

14430
07:43:57,142 --> 07:43:57,809
SUPPORT AN FBI INVESTIGATION 

14431
07:43:57,809 --> 07:43:58,377
RIGHT NOW? 

14432
07:43:58,377 --> 07:43:59,378
>> I WILL DO WHATEVER THE 

14433
07:43:59,378 --> 07:43:59,912
COMMITTEE WANTS. 

14434
07:43:59,912 --> 07:44:00,812
>> PERSONALLY, DO YOU THINK 

14435
07:44:00,812 --> 07:44:02,781
THAT IS THE BEST THING FOR US 

14436
07:44:02,781 --> 07:44:06,718
TO DO? 

14437
07:44:06,718 --> 07:44:08,120
DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER? 

14438
07:44:08,120 --> 07:44:12,224
>> LOOK, SENATOR. 

14439
07:44:12,224 --> 07:44:13,659
I HAVE SAID THAT I WANT TO THE 

14440
07:44:13,659 --> 07:44:13,926
HEARING. 

14441
07:44:13,926 --> 07:44:16,061
I SAID THAT I WAS WELCOMING 

14442
07:44:16,061 --> 07:44:16,328
ANYTHING. 

14443
07:44:16,328 --> 07:44:17,596
I AM INNOCENT. 

14444
07:44:17,596 --> 07:44:21,066
THIS THING WAS HELD. IT WAS 

14445
07:44:21,066 --> 07:44:22,434
HELD WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN 

14446
07:44:22,434 --> 07:44:23,802
PRESENTED IN AN ORDINARY WAY. 

14447
07:44:23,802 --> 07:44:25,771
IT COULD HAVE BEEN HELD AND 

14448
07:44:25,771 --> 07:44:27,606
HANDLED CONFIDENTIALITY AT 

14449
07:44:27,606 --> 07:44:28,340
FIRST. 

14450
07:44:28,340 --> 07:44:32,110
WHICH IS WHAT DR. FORD'S WISHES 

14451
07:44:32,110 --> 07:44:33,312
WERE, AS I UNDERSTOOD IT. 

14452
07:44:33,312 --> 07:44:34,446
IT WOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED MY 

14453
07:44:34,446 --> 07:44:37,382
FAMILY LIKE THIS EFFORT HAS. 

14454
07:44:37,382 --> 07:44:39,818
>> I THINK IN FBI INVESTIGATION 

14455
07:44:39,818 --> 07:44:41,353
WILL HELP ALL OF US ON BOTH 

14456
07:44:41,353 --> 07:44:43,021
SIDES OF THE ISSUE. 

14457
07:44:43,021 --> 07:44:45,724
>> SENATOR GRAHAM ASKS FOR THE 

14458
07:44:45,724 --> 07:44:46,391
FLOOR. 

14459
07:44:46,391 --> 07:44:53,865
BEFORE HE DOES, IT SEEMS TO ME 

14460
07:44:53,865 --> 07:44:55,300
THAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW 

14461
07:44:55,300 --> 07:44:56,101
SOMETHING, YOU HAVE THE WITNESS 

14462
07:44:56,101 --> 07:44:57,336
RIGHT HERE TO ASK HIM AND 

14463
07:44:57,336 --> 07:44:58,936
SECONDLY, IF YOU WANT IN FBI 

14464
07:44:58,936 --> 07:45:01,172
REPORTS, YOU CAN ASK FOR IT 

14465
07:45:01,172 --> 07:45:02,574
YOURSELF. 

14466
07:45:02,574 --> 07:45:04,543
I HAVE ASKED FOR FBI REPORTS IN 

14467
07:45:04,543 --> 07:45:05,410
THE PAST. 

14468
07:45:05,410 --> 07:45:07,012
IN THE 38 YEARS THAT I HAVE 

14469
07:45:07,012 --> 07:45:08,146
BEEN IN THE SENATE. 

14470
07:45:08,146 --> 07:45:13,819
>> ARE YOU AWARE THAT AT 9:23 

14471
07:45:13,819 --> 07:45:18,357
ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 9, THE DAY 

14472
07:45:18,357 --> 07:45:19,257
YOU WERE NOMINATED TO THE 

14473
07:45:19,257 --> 07:45:20,492
SUPREME COURT, BY PRESIDENT 

14474
07:45:20,492 --> 07:45:23,095
TRUMP, SENATOR SCHUMER SAID, 23 

14475
07:45:23,095 --> 07:45:26,865
MINUTES AFTER NOMINATION, I 

14476
07:45:26,865 --> 07:45:27,599
WILL OPPOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

14477
07:45:27,599 --> 07:45:28,199
NOMINATION WITH EVERYTHING I 

14478
07:45:28,199 --> 07:45:28,500
HAVE. 

14479
07:45:28,500 --> 07:45:31,803
I HAVE A -- I HOPE A BIPARTISAN 

14480
07:45:31,803 --> 07:45:34,773
GEORDIE WILL DO THE SAME. 

14481
07:45:34,773 --> 07:45:36,641
THE STAKES ARE SIMPLY TOO HIGH 

14482
07:45:36,641 --> 07:45:37,108
FOR ANYTHING LESS. 

14483
07:45:37,108 --> 07:45:40,545
IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE, YOU ARE 

14484
07:45:40,545 --> 07:45:40,846
NOW. 

14485
07:45:40,846 --> 07:45:42,314
DID YOU MEET WITH SENATOR 

14486
07:45:42,314 --> 07:45:47,853
DIANNE FEINSTEIN ON AUGUST 20? 

14487
07:45:47,853 --> 07:45:49,521
>> DID YOU KNOW THAT HER STAFF 

14488
07:45:49,521 --> 07:45:50,255
HAD ALREADY RECOMMENDED A 

14489
07:45:50,255 --> 07:45:50,922
LAWYER TO DR. FORD? 

14490
07:45:50,922 --> 07:45:52,157
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT. 

14491
07:45:52,157 --> 07:45:53,592
>> DID YOU KNOW THAT HER AND 

14492
07:45:53,592 --> 07:45:54,593
HER STAFF HAD THESE ALLEGATIONS 

14493
07:45:54,593 --> 07:45:57,229
FOR OVER 20 DAYS? 

14494
07:45:57,229 --> 07:45:59,097
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT AT THE 

14495
07:45:59,097 --> 07:46:01,500
TIME. 

14496
07:46:01,500 --> 07:46:02,834
>> IF YOU WANTED IN FBI 

14497
07:46:02,834 --> 07:46:03,535
INVESTIGATION, YOU COULD HAVE 

14498
07:46:03,535 --> 07:46:04,236
COME TO US. 

14499
07:46:04,236 --> 07:46:06,038
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY 

14500
07:46:06,038 --> 07:46:07,572
THIS GUYS LIFE, HOLD THE SEAT 

14501
07:46:07,572 --> 07:46:11,109
OPEN, AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020. 

14502
07:46:11,109 --> 07:46:12,177
YOU SAID THAT. 

14503
07:46:12,177 --> 07:46:13,879
NOT ME. 

14504
07:46:13,879 --> 07:46:15,379
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE 

14505
07:46:15,379 --> 07:46:16,348
FOR. 

14506
07:46:16,348 --> 07:46:20,352
WHEN YOU SEE THEM SAYING THAT 

14507
07:46:20,352 --> 07:46:20,952
LINDSAY SAID THIS. 

14508
07:46:20,952 --> 07:46:23,755
I VOTED FOR THEM. 

14509
07:46:23,755 --> 07:46:25,157
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT 

14510
07:46:25,157 --> 07:46:26,491
YOU HAVE DONE TO THE SKY. 

14511
07:46:26,491 --> 07:46:30,662
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL, SHAM

14512
07:46:30,662 --> 07:46:33,198
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS. 

14513
07:46:33,198 --> 07:46:34,499
IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW 

14514
07:46:34,499 --> 07:46:36,034
THE TRUTH, YOU SURE WOULD NOT 

14515
07:46:36,034 --> 07:46:38,603
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE 

14516
07:46:38,603 --> 07:46:40,272
THIS GUY. 

14517
07:46:40,272 --> 07:46:41,640
YOU A GANG RAPIST? 

14518
07:46:41,640 --> 07:46:44,743
>> NO. 

14519
07:46:44,743 --> 07:46:46,344
>> I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU 

14520
07:46:46,344 --> 07:46:48,013
AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE 

14521
07:46:48,013 --> 07:46:50,816
THROUGH. 

14522
07:46:50,816 --> 07:46:51,450
YOU WANT POWER. 

14523
07:46:51,450 --> 07:46:53,251
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET A. OF THE 

14524
07:46:53,251 --> 07:46:55,921
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE THROUGH 

14525
07:46:55,921 --> 07:46:56,354
THIS SHAM. 

14526
07:46:56,354 --> 07:46:58,890
THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU 

14527
07:46:58,890 --> 07:46:59,591
HELD IT. 

14528
07:46:59,591 --> 07:47:00,425
YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF 

14529
07:47:00,425 --> 07:47:03,462
PROTECTING DR. FORD. 

14530
07:47:03,462 --> 07:47:03,662
NONE. 

14531
07:47:03,662 --> 07:47:05,263
SHE IS AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS 

14532
07:47:05,263 --> 07:47:05,697
YOU ARE. 

14533
07:47:05,697 --> 07:47:07,933
I HATE TO SAY IT, BECAUSE THESE 

14534
07:47:07,933 --> 07:47:09,968
HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS. 

14535
07:47:09,968 --> 07:47:11,403
BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN IT 

14536
07:47:11,403 --> 07:47:13,271
COMES TO THIS, YOU ARE LOOKING 

14537
07:47:13,271 --> 07:47:15,607
FOR A FAIR PROCESS. YOU CAME TO 

14538
07:47:15,607 --> 07:47:17,042
THE WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG 

14539
07:47:17,042 --> 07:47:20,178
TIME, MY FRIEND. 

14540
07:47:20,178 --> 07:47:21,713
YOU CONSIDER THIS A JOB 

14541
07:47:21,713 --> 07:47:22,681
INTERVIEW? 

14542
07:47:22,681 --> 07:47:28,420
>> THE ADVICE AND CONSENT RULE 

14543
07:47:28,420 --> 07:47:28,620
IS. 

14544
07:47:28,620 --> 07:47:29,955
>> YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU HAVE 

14545
07:47:29,955 --> 07:47:34,326
BEEN THROUGH A JOB INTERVIEW? 

14546
07:47:34,326 --> 07:47:35,360
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH A PROCESS 

14547
07:47:35,360 --> 07:47:36,661
OF ADVICE AND CONSENT UNDER THE 

14548
07:47:36,661 --> 07:47:36,994
CONSTITUTION. 

14549
07:47:36,994 --> 07:47:38,597
>> WOULD YOU SAY YOU HAVE BEEN 

14550
07:47:38,597 --> 07:47:38,830
THROUGH 

14551
07:47:38,830 --> 07:47:40,232
>> I HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND THEN 

14552
07:47:40,232 --> 07:47:40,432
SOME. 

14553
07:47:40,432 --> 07:47:42,334
>> THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW. 

14554
07:47:42,334 --> 07:47:46,605
THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY

14555
07:47:46,605 --> 07:47:48,006
THE ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO 

14556
07:47:48,006 --> 07:47:49,374
COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS 

14557
07:47:49,374 --> 07:47:51,576
CRAP. 

14558
07:47:51,576 --> 07:47:56,848
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK. 

14559
07:47:56,848 --> 07:47:57,849
YOU HAVE INTERACTED WITH 

14560
07:47:57,849 --> 07:47:58,483
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ALL YOUR 

14561
07:47:58,483 --> 07:47:58,683
LIFE. 

14562
07:47:58,683 --> 07:48:00,085
NOT ONE ACCUSATION. 

14563
07:48:00,085 --> 07:48:04,489
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BILL SCOTT

14564
07:48:04,489 --> 07:48:05,824
-- BILL COSBY WOULD YOUR JUNIOR 

14565
07:48:05,824 --> 07:48:06,725
AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL. 

14566
07:48:06,725 --> 07:48:08,460
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU GOT OVER 

14567
07:48:08,460 --> 07:48:08,660
IT. 

14568
07:48:08,660 --> 07:48:14,266
IT HAS BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING 

14569
07:48:14,266 --> 07:48:15,567
THAT IF YOU DRUG WOMEN AND RAPE 

14570
07:48:15,567 --> 07:48:16,968
THEM FOR 2 YEARS IN HIGH 

14571
07:48:16,968 --> 07:48:18,203
SCHOOL, YOU PROBABLY DON'T 

14572
07:48:18,203 --> 07:48:18,403
STOP. 

14573
07:48:18,403 --> 07:48:19,804
HERE IS MY UNDERSTANDING. 

14574
07:48:19,804 --> 07:48:22,240
IF YOU HAVE LIVED A GOOD LIFE, 

14575
07:48:22,240 --> 07:48:25,477
PEOPLE WILL RECOGNIZE IT. 

14576
07:48:25,477 --> 07:48:26,611
BUT THE AMERICAN BAR 

14577
07:48:26,611 --> 07:48:27,946
ASSOCIATION HAS AS THE GOLD 

14578
07:48:27,946 --> 07:48:28,680
STANDARD.

14579
07:48:28,680 --> 07:48:31,149
'S INTEGRITY IS ABSOLUTELY 

14580
07:48:31,149 --> 07:48:32,784
UNQUESTIONED. 

14581
07:48:32,784 --> 07:48:34,419
HE IS THE VERY CIRCUMSPECT IN 

14582
07:48:34,419 --> 07:48:36,888
HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT. HE 

14583
07:48:36,888 --> 07:48:39,424
HARBORS NO BIASES OR RIGID IS 

14584
07:48:39,424 --> 07:48:40,358
HIS. 

14585
07:48:40,358 --> 07:48:41,993
HE IS ENTIRELY ETHICAL. 

14586
07:48:41,993 --> 07:48:44,396
IS A REALLY DECENT PERSON. 

14587
07:48:44,396 --> 07:48:45,630
HE IS WARM, FRIENDLY, 

14588
07:48:45,630 --> 07:48:45,930
UNASSUMING. 

14589
07:48:45,930 --> 07:48:48,066
HE IS THE NICEST PERSON. 

14590
07:48:48,066 --> 07:48:52,103
THAT IS FROM THE ABA. 

14591
07:48:52,103 --> 07:48:53,738
ONE THING I SHOULD TELL YOU YOU 

14592
07:48:53,738 --> 07:48:54,539
SHOULD BE PROUD OF. 

14593
07:48:54,539 --> 07:48:55,640
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS. 

14594
07:48:55,640 --> 07:48:58,443
YOU RAISED A DAUGHTER WHO HAD 

14595
07:48:58,443 --> 07:49:01,179
THE GOOD CHARACTER TO PRAY FOR 

14596
07:49:01,179 --> 07:49:02,847
DR. FORD. 

14597
07:49:02,847 --> 07:49:04,449
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF 

14598
07:49:04,449 --> 07:49:06,318
YOU VOTE NO. 

14599
07:49:06,318 --> 07:49:11,423
YOU ARE LEGITIMIZING THE MOST 

14600
07:49:11,423 --> 07:49:12,657
DESPICABLE THING I HAVE SEEN IN 

14601
07:49:12,657 --> 07:49:13,858
MY TIME IN POLITICS. 

14602
07:49:13,858 --> 07:49:15,894
YOU WANT THE SEAT? 

14603
07:49:15,894 --> 07:49:18,430
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT. 

14604
07:49:18,430 --> 07:49:20,231
I HOPE YOU ARE ON THE SUPREME 

14605
07:49:20,231 --> 07:49:20,966
COURT. 

14606
07:49:20,966 --> 07:49:22,200
THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE HE SHOULD 

14607
07:49:22,200 --> 07:49:22,934
BE. 

14608
07:49:22,934 --> 07:49:26,605
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL 

14609
07:49:26,605 --> 07:49:32,611
SEE THROUGH THIS CHARADE. 

14610
07:49:32,611 --> 07:49:34,145
I INTEND TO VOTE FOR YOU AND I 

14611
07:49:34,145 --> 07:49:35,613
HOPE EVERYONE WHO IS FAIR-

14612
07:49:35,613 --> 07:49:37,382
MINDED WILL.

>> SENATOR WHITE HOUSE. 

14614
07:49:45,557 --> 07:49:46,057
-- WHITEHOUSE. 

14615
07:49:46,057 --> 07:49:47,359
>> DO THAT WE SHOULD LET THINGS 

14616
07:49:47,359 --> 07:49:49,127
SETTLE A LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT? 

14617
07:49:49,127 --> 07:49:50,829
>> WE COULD TAKE A 62nd BREAK. 

14618
07:49:50,829 --> 07:49:55,100
>> I AM GOOD. 

14619
07:49:55,100 --> 07:49:57,836
>> ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE 

14620
07:49:57,836 --> 07:50:00,137
ARE LOOKING AT THE YEARBOOK IS 

14621
07:50:00,137 --> 07:50:02,774
THAT IT IS RELATIVELY 

14622
07:50:02,774 --> 07:50:05,643
CONSISTENT IN TIME WITH THE 

14623
07:50:05,643 --> 07:50:09,881
EVENTS AT ISSUE HERE AND, 

14624
07:50:09,881 --> 07:50:11,783
BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO BE YOUR 

14625
07:50:11,783 --> 07:50:14,753
WORDS. 

14626
07:50:14,753 --> 07:50:15,987
IS IT, IN FACT, YOUR WORDS ON 

14627
07:50:15,987 --> 07:50:17,856
YOUR YEARBOOK PAGE? 

14628
07:50:17,856 --> 07:50:19,057
>> WE SUBMITTED THINGS TO THE 

14629
07:50:19,057 --> 07:50:24,362
EDITORS AND I BELIEVE THEY TOOK 

14630
07:50:24,362 --> 07:50:24,663
THEM. 

14631
07:50:24,663 --> 07:50:25,864
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CHANGED 

14632
07:50:25,864 --> 07:50:26,564
THINGS ARE NOT. 

14633
07:50:26,564 --> 07:50:27,799
>> YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY 

14634
07:50:27,799 --> 07:50:28,066
CHANGES? 

14635
07:50:28,066 --> 07:50:29,634
>> I AM NOT AWARE OF ONE WHERE 

14636
07:50:29,634 --> 07:50:30,035
THE OTHER. 

14637
07:50:30,035 --> 07:50:31,870
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND 

14638
07:50:31,870 --> 07:50:33,972
CONTEST THAT.

THROUGH MY YEARBOOK. 

14641
07:50:36,074 --> 07:50:37,108
>> I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED. 

14642
07:50:37,108 --> 07:50:37,909
LAWYERS SHOULD BE WORKING OFF 

14643
07:50:37,909 --> 07:50:41,980
OF COMMON TERMS AND UNDERSTAND 

14644
07:50:41,980 --> 07:50:43,315
THE WORDS THAT WE ARE USING. 

14645
07:50:43,315 --> 07:50:46,851
IT IS A PRETTY BASIC PRINCIPLE 

14646
07:50:46,851 --> 07:50:48,887
AMONG LAWYERS, WHEN YOU AGREE? 

14647
07:50:48,887 --> 07:50:50,955
>> IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT MY 

14648
07:50:50,955 --> 07:50:51,556
YEARBOOK, HAVE AT IT. 

14649
07:50:51,556 --> 07:50:55,560
>> LET'S LOOK AT BEACH WEEK

14653
07:51:06,137 --> 07:51:06,571
THROWING UP. 

14654
07:51:06,571 --> 07:51:08,440
I AM KNOWN TO HAVE A WEAK 

14655

>> THIS IS WELL KNOWN. 

14659
07:51:18,550 --> 07:51:19,984
ANYONE WHO HAS KNOWN ME, LIKE A 

14660
07:51:19,984 --> 07:51:21,519
LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND ME, THEY 

14661

REFERENCE RELATED TO THE 

14667
07:51:35,633 --> 07:51:36,767
CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL? 

14668
07:51:36,767 --> 07:51:40,672
>> SIR, I WAS THE TOP OF MY 

14669
07:51:40,672 --> 07:51:41,105
CLASS ACADEMICALLY. 

14670
07:51:41,105 --> 07:51:43,341
I BUSTED MY BUTT IN SCHOOL. 

14671
07:51:43,341 --> 07:51:46,578
I WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THE 

14672
07:51:46,578 --> 07:51:48,012
VARSITY BEST BALL TEAM. 

14673
07:51:48,012 --> 07:51:49,514
GOT INTO YALE COLLEGE. 

14674
07:51:49,514 --> 07:51:51,850
I GOT INTO YALE LAW SCHOOL. 

14675
07:51:51,850 --> 07:51:56,855
I WORKED MY TAIL OFF. 

14676
07:51:56,855 --> 07:51:58,023
>> AND? 

14677
07:51:58,023 --> 07:52:01,860
DID THE WORD RALPH, THAT YOU

USED HERE. 

14679
07:52:02,460 --> 07:52:03,794
>> ALREADY ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

14680
07:52:03,794 --> 07:52:08,265
>> DO RELATE TO ALCOHOL? 

14681
07:52:08,265 --> 07:52:10,802
>> I LIKE BEER. 

14682
07:52:10,802 --> 07:52:12,771
WHAT YOU LIKE TO DRINK. 

14683
07:52:12,771 --> 07:52:15,340
>> THE NEXT QUESTION, I DON'T 

14684
07:52:15,340 --> 07:52:24,149
KNOW IF IT IS BUFFED --? 

14685
07:52:24,149 --> 07:52:27,018
>> THAT REFERS TO FLATULENCE. 

14686
07:52:27,018 --> 07:52:27,619
WE WERE 16. 

14687
07:52:27,619 --> 07:52:31,189
>> WHEN YOU'RE FRIEND MARK 

14688
07:52:31,189 --> 07:52:32,323
JUDGE PUT THE SAME THING BACK 

14689
07:52:32,323 --> 07:52:33,725
TO YOU, HE HAD THE SAME 

14690
07:52:33,725 --> 07:52:34,359
MEANING, IT WAS FLATULENCE? 

14691
07:52:34,359 --> 07:52:35,760
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID, 

14692
07:52:35,760 --> 07:52:38,797
THAT WAS MY REGULATION. 

14693
07:52:38,797 --> 07:52:40,165
WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT 

14694
07:52:40,165 --> 07:52:42,667
FLATULENCE AT YOUR 16 ON 

14695
07:52:42,667 --> 07:52:43,601
YEARBOOK PAGE, I AM GAME. 

14696
07:52:43,601 --> 07:52:52,744
>> YOU MENTIONED, I THINK, THE 

14697
07:52:52,744 --> 07:53:00,418
RENATE, I DON'T KNOW THE 

14698
07:53:00,418 --> 07:53:00,785
PRONUNCIATION? 

14699
07:53:00,785 --> 07:53:06,224
AND WHAT DOES THE WORD ALUMNIUS 

14700
07:53:06,224 --> 07:53:06,424
MEAN. 

14701
07:53:06,424 --> 07:53:08,092
>> SHE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF 

14702
07:53:08,092 --> 07:53:10,094
OURS. 

14703
07:53:10,094 --> 07:53:11,529
A BUNCH OF US WENT TO DANCES 

14704
07:53:11,529 --> 07:53:12,130
WITH HER. 

14705
07:53:12,130 --> 07:53:13,565
SHE HUNG OUT WITH US AS A 

14706
07:53:13,565 --> 07:53:13,798
GROUP. 

14707
07:53:13,798 --> 07:53:14,866
THE MEDIA CIRCUS THAT HAS BEEN 

14708
07:53:14,866 --> 07:53:16,201
GENERATED BY THIS THOUGHT AND 

14709
07:53:16,201 --> 07:53:17,202
REPORTED THAT A REFERRED TO 

14710
07:53:17,202 --> 07:53:17,969
SEX. 

14711
07:53:17,969 --> 07:53:20,004
IT DID NOT. 

14712
07:53:20,004 --> 07:53:22,907
SHE HERSELF SAID ON THE RECORD, 

14713
07:53:22,907 --> 07:53:23,875
DID I HAVE ANY SEXUAL 

14714
07:53:23,875 --> 07:53:24,476
INTERACTION WITH HER. 

14715
07:53:24,476 --> 07:53:27,979
I AM SORRY THAT THIS HAS BEEN 

14716
07:53:27,979 --> 07:53:32,217
MISINTERPRETED AND SORRY IS! 

14717
07:53:32,217 --> 07:53:32,917
MY OPENING STATEMENT. 

14718
07:53:32,917 --> 07:53:33,818
SHE IS A GOOD PERSON. 

14719
07:53:33,818 --> 07:53:34,953
TO HAVE HER NAME DRAGGED 

14720
07:53:34,953 --> 07:53:39,157
THROUGH THE HEARING IS A JOKE. 

14721
07:53:39,157 --> 07:53:40,492
IT IS REALLY AN EMBARRASSMENT. 

14722
07:53:40,492 --> 07:53:42,126
>> DEVILS TRIANGLE? 

14723
07:53:42,126 --> 07:53:46,264
>> DRINKING GAME. 

14724
07:53:46,264 --> 07:53:47,365
>> HOW IS IT PLAYED? 

14725
07:53:47,365 --> 07:53:48,299
>> THREE GLASSES IN THE 

14726
07:53:48,299 --> 07:53:49,033
TRIANGLE. 

14727
07:53:49,033 --> 07:53:54,105
>> AND HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED 

14728
07:53:54,105 --> 07:53:54,372
QUARTERS? 

14729
07:53:54,372 --> 07:53:58,343
>> NO. 

14730
07:53:58,343 --> 07:54:01,145
>> AND DOHERTY? 

14731
07:54:01,145 --> 07:54:07,752
>> AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 

14732
07:54:07,752 --> 07:54:09,153
CALLER, SHE HAD A PARTY AND THE 

14733
07:54:09,153 --> 07:54:10,621
FOURTH OF JULY AT THE BEACH IN 

14734
07:54:10,621 --> 07:54:10,888
DELAWARE. 

14735
07:54:10,888 --> 07:54:13,625
>> THERE ARE 7F'S ON THE FOURTH 

14736
07:54:13,625 --> 07:54:16,127
OF JULY. DOES THAT MEAN? 

14737
07:54:16,127 --> 07:54:19,564
ONE OF OUR FRIENDS, KLOBUCHAR, 

14738
07:54:19,564 --> 07:54:20,899
WHEN HE SAID THE F WORD 

14739
07:54:20,899 --> 07:54:22,400
STARTING AT A YOUNG AGE,  HAD A 

14740
07:54:22,400 --> 07:54:25,737
WIND UP TO THE F WORD. 

14741
07:54:25,737 --> 07:54:27,305
AND THEN THE WORD WOULD COME 

14742
07:54:27,305 --> 07:54:29,674
OUT. 

14743
07:54:29,674 --> 07:54:30,909
WHEN WE WERE 15, WE THOUGHT 

14744
07:54:30,909 --> 07:54:31,810
THAT WAS FUNNY. 

14745
07:54:31,810 --> 07:54:33,545
IT BECAME AN INSIDE JOKE FOR 

14746
07:54:33,545 --> 07:54:36,748
HOW HE WOULD SAY WHAT I WILL 

14747
07:54:36,748 --> 07:54:40,084
NOT REAP -- TO BE HERE. 

14748
07:54:40,084 --> 07:54:43,087
>> REFERRING TO GEORGETOWN 

14749
07:54:43,087 --> 07:54:43,621
VERSUS LOUISVILLE. 

14750
07:54:43,621 --> 07:54:45,155
>> DO ANYMORE IN THE F? 

14751
07:54:45,155 --> 07:54:48,059
>> YOU RESPOND, WHO ONE THAT 

14752
07:54:48,059 --> 07:54:50,828
GAME ANYWAY. 

14753
07:54:50,828 --> 07:54:52,263
SHOULD WE DRAW ANY CONCLUSION 

14754
07:54:52,263 --> 07:54:56,568
THAT A LOSS OF RECOLLECTION 

14755
07:54:56,568 --> 07:55:00,104
RELATED TO ALCOHOL WAS THERE? 

14756
07:55:00,104 --> 07:55:03,408
>> FIRST HAND, WE WERE WATCHING 

14757
07:55:03,408 --> 07:55:06,444
IT ON TV AT A PARTY. 

14758
07:55:06,444 --> 07:55:09,480
>> THAT IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH

14759
07:55:09,480 --> 07:55:10,314
TRICKING AND NOT REMEMBERING 

14760
07:55:10,314 --> 07:55:11,015
WHAT HAPPENED. 

14761
07:55:11,015 --> 07:55:15,219
>> I'M AWARE. 

14762
07:55:15,219 --> 07:55:16,688
AT THE POINT OF BOTH IS THAT WE 

14763
07:55:16,688 --> 07:55:18,490
WERE, IN ESSENCE, HAVING A 

14764
07:55:18,490 --> 07:55:19,891
PARTY AND DID NOT PAY ATTENTION 

14765
07:55:19,891 --> 07:55:21,125
TO THE GAME, EVEN THOUGH THE 

14766
07:55:21,125 --> 07:55:22,527
GAME WAS THE EXCUSE WE HAD FOR 

14767
07:55:22,527 --> 07:55:22,927
GETTING TOGETHER. 

14768
07:55:22,927 --> 07:55:27,499
THAT IS VERY COMMON. 

14769
07:55:27,499 --> 07:55:28,833
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN 

14770
07:55:28,833 --> 07:55:30,368
TO A SUPER BOWL PARTY AND NOT 

14771
07:55:30,368 --> 07:55:31,569
PAID ATTENTION TO THE GAME AND 

14772
07:55:31,569 --> 07:55:32,437
JUST HUNG OUT WITH YOUR 

14773
07:55:32,437 --> 07:55:32,704
FRIENDS. 

14774
07:55:32,704 --> 07:55:34,072
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE DONE 

14775
07:55:34,072 --> 07:55:35,506
THAT OR NOT, BUT THAT IS WHAT 

14776
07:55:35,506 --> 07:55:36,808
WE ARE REFERRING TO. 

14777
07:55:36,808 --> 07:55:37,442

14779
07:55:38,943 --> 07:55:43,014
MORE  EMBARRASSING SCANDAL FOR 

14780
07:55:43,014 --> 07:55:45,650
THE UNITED STATES SENATE SINCE 

14781
07:55:45,650 --> 07:55:48,186
THE McCARTHY HEARINGS. 

14782
07:55:48,186 --> 07:55:49,287
WHEN THE COMMENT WAS ABOUT THE 

14783
07:55:49,287 --> 07:55:50,888
CRUELTY OF THE PROCESS TOWARD 

14784
07:55:50,888 --> 07:55:53,191
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED. 

14785
07:55:53,191 --> 07:55:55,026
AND THE QUESTION WAS ASKED, 

14786
07:55:55,026 --> 07:55:59,030
HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF DECENCY? 

14787
07:55:59,030 --> 07:56:02,100
I AM AFRAID THAT WE HAVE LOST 

14788
07:56:02,100 --> 07:56:05,236
THAT, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME 

14789
07:56:05,236 --> 07:56:06,571
BEING. 

14790
07:56:06,571 --> 07:56:07,705
TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE 

14791
07:56:07,705 --> 07:56:08,806
BEEN ACCUSED OF MULTIPLE 

14792
07:56:08,806 --> 07:56:09,039
CRIMES? 

14793
07:56:09,039 --> 07:56:11,442
>> I AM PAINFULLY AWARE, FOR MY 

14794
07:56:11,442 --> 07:56:12,910
FAMILY AND ME, TO READ ABOUT 

14795
07:56:12,910 --> 07:56:15,513
THIS. 

14796
07:56:15,513 --> 07:56:16,313
AND THE BREATHLESS REPORTING. 

14797
07:56:16,313 --> 07:56:19,717
>> THE SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT DR. 

14798
07:56:19,717 --> 07:56:21,552
FORD CLAIMS AND THAT YOU HAVE 

14799
07:56:21,552 --> 07:56:24,888
DENIED THE CLAIMS OF MS. 

14800
07:56:24,888 --> 07:56:28,760
RAMIREZ, THAT NOT EVEN THE NEW 

14801
07:56:28,760 --> 07:56:29,994
YORK TIMES A REPORT BECAUSE IT 

14802
07:56:29,994 --> 07:56:31,129
CANNOT CORROBORATE IT. 

14803
07:56:31,129 --> 07:56:33,765
AND THEN STORMY DANIELS LAWYER 

14804
07:56:33,765 --> 07:56:35,066
RELEASED A BOMBSHELL ACCUSING 

14805
07:56:35,066 --> 07:56:40,505
YOU OF GANG RAPE. 

14806
07:56:40,505 --> 07:56:41,706
ALL OF THOSE ARE CRIMES, ARE 

14807
07:56:41,706 --> 07:56:42,140
THEY NOT? 

14808
07:56:42,140 --> 07:56:42,740
>> THEY ARE. 

14809
07:56:42,740 --> 07:56:44,142
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET MY 

14810
07:56:44,142 --> 07:56:44,776
REPUTATION BACK. 

14811
07:56:44,776 --> 07:56:47,611
MY LIFE IS TOTALLY AND 

14812
07:56:47,611 --> 07:56:52,684
PERMANENTLY ALTERED. 

14813
07:56:52,684 --> 07:56:54,118
3 JUDGE, DO NOT GIVE UP. 

14814
07:56:54,118 --> 07:56:54,919
>> I'M NOT GIVING UP. 

14815
07:56:54,919 --> 07:56:56,154
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE 

14816
07:56:56,154 --> 07:57:02,260
LISTENING TO THIS AND THEY WILL 

14817
07:57:02,260 --> 07:57:02,894
MAKE THE DECISION. 

14818
07:57:02,894 --> 07:57:04,195
I THINK YOU WILL COME OUT ON 

14819
07:57:04,195 --> 07:57:05,296
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THAT. 

14820
07:57:05,296 --> 07:57:06,531
>> I WILL ALWAYS BE A GOOD 

14821
07:57:06,531 --> 07:57:07,965
PERSON AND TRY TO BE A GOOD 

14822
07:57:07,965 --> 07:57:08,565
JUDGE, WHATEVER HAPPENS. 

14823
07:57:08,565 --> 07:57:10,000
>> THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW. 

14824
07:57:10,000 --> 07:57:11,602
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF A 

14825
07:57:11,602 --> 07:57:17,475
CRIME. 

14826
07:57:17,475 --> 07:57:18,676
IF YOU HAVE LIED TO THE 

14827
07:57:18,676 --> 07:57:19,510
COMMITTEE AND THE 

14828
07:57:19,510 --> 07:57:20,411
INVESTIGATORS, THAT IS A CRIME 

14829
07:57:20,411 --> 07:57:21,646
IN AND OF ITSELF, IS THAT 

14830
07:57:21,646 --> 07:57:21,912
CORRECT? 

14831
07:57:21,912 --> 07:57:22,546
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 

14832
07:57:22,546 --> 07:57:23,948
>> IN ORDER TO VOTE AGAINST HER 

14833
07:57:23,948 --> 07:57:24,982
NOMINATION, WE WOULD HAVE TO 

14834
07:57:24,982 --> 07:57:26,684
CONCLUDE THAT YOU ARE A SERIAL 

14835
07:57:26,684 --> 07:57:28,252
LIAR. 

14836
07:57:28,252 --> 07:57:29,454
AND THAT YOU HAVE EXPOSED 

14837
07:57:29,454 --> 07:57:31,522
YOURSELF TO LEGAL JEOPARDY IN 

14838
07:57:31,522 --> 07:57:32,824
YOUR INTERACTION WITH THIS 

14839
07:57:32,824 --> 07:57:35,893
COMMITTEE AND THE INVESTIGATORS.

14840
07:57:35,893 --> 07:57:36,994
IS THAT NOT CORRECT? 

14841
07:57:36,994 --> 07:57:37,995
>> THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. 

14842
07:57:37,995 --> 07:57:41,666
YOU TALKED IN YOUR INTERVIEW 

14843
07:57:41,666 --> 07:57:43,501
THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT A FAIR 

14844
07:57:43,501 --> 07:57:43,901
PROCESS. 

14845
07:57:43,901 --> 07:57:45,470
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS 

14846
07:57:45,470 --> 07:57:48,039
THE AISLE SAY THAT THE BURDEN 

14847
07:57:48,039 --> 07:57:50,174
IS NOT ON THE ACCUSER, BECAUSE 

14848
07:57:50,174 --> 07:57:53,911
THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW. THE 

14849
07:57:53,911 --> 07:57:54,846
BURDEN IS ON YOU. 

14850
07:57:54,846 --> 07:57:57,982
YOU SAY, YOU WERE NOT THERE AND 

14851
07:57:57,982 --> 07:57:58,883
IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 

14852
07:57:58,883 --> 07:58:00,118
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO 

14853
07:58:00,118 --> 07:58:00,518
PROVE A NEGATIVE. 

14854
07:58:00,518 --> 07:58:01,853
SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST YOU 

14855
07:58:01,853 --> 07:58:03,821
HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF A CRIME AND

14856
07:58:03,821 --> 07:58:06,924
THAT A FAIR PROCESS, UNDER THE 

14857
07:58:06,924 --> 07:58:11,129
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, 

14858
07:58:11,129 --> 07:58:12,130
UNDER NOTION OF FAIR PLAY, 

14859
07:58:12,130 --> 07:58:13,464
MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE 

14860
07:58:13,464 --> 07:58:14,599
AN ACCUSATION AGAINST YOU HAVE 

14861
07:58:14,599 --> 07:58:15,366
TO COME FORWARD WITH SOME 

14862
07:58:15,366 --> 07:58:15,800
EVIDENCE. 

14863
07:58:15,800 --> 07:58:17,869
IS THAT NOT PART OF A FAIR 

14864
07:58:17,869 --> 07:58:19,370
PROCESS? 

14865
07:58:19,370 --> 07:58:24,075
>> YES, SENATOR. 

14866
07:58:24,075 --> 07:58:25,743
>> PART OF THAT MEANS THAT IF 

14867
07:58:25,743 --> 07:58:26,644
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE AN 

14868
07:58:26,644 --> 07:58:28,146
ALLEGATION, THERE NEEDS TO BE 

14869
07:58:28,146 --> 07:58:28,479
COOPERATION. 

14870
07:58:28,479 --> 07:58:29,380
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE NOT 

14871
07:58:29,380 --> 07:58:30,815
GUILTY BECAUSE SOMEONE MAKES AN 

14872
07:58:30,815 --> 07:58:32,216
ACCUSATION AGAINST YOU IN THIS 

14873
07:58:32,216 --> 07:58:32,483
COUNTRY. 

14874
07:58:32,483 --> 07:58:34,652
WE ARE NOT A POLICE STATE. 

14875
07:58:34,652 --> 07:58:35,787
WE DO NOT GIVE THE GOVERNMENT 

14876
07:58:35,787 --> 07:58:36,687
THAT KIND OF POWER. 

14877
07:58:36,687 --> 07:58:40,491
WE INSIST THAT THOSE CHARGES BE 

14878
07:58:40,491 --> 07:58:42,126
PROVEN. 

14879
07:58:42,126 --> 07:58:44,028
I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT IN A 

14880
07:58:44,028 --> 07:58:45,863
COURT. 

14881
07:58:45,863 --> 07:58:47,098
UNTIL MY CALLING IF WE WERE 

14882
07:58:47,098 --> 07:58:49,267
COURT, HALF OF THEM WILL BE IN 

14883
07:58:49,267 --> 07:58:50,334
ATTEMPT OF COURT. 

14884
07:58:50,334 --> 07:58:52,170
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF A 

14885
07:58:52,170 --> 07:58:52,436
CRIME. 

14886
07:58:52,436 --> 07:58:55,573
I BELIEVE, FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS 

14887
07:58:55,573 --> 07:58:57,542
OF FAIR PLAY AND JUSTICE IN THE 

14888
07:58:57,542 --> 07:59:02,079
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. IF SOME 

14889
07:59:02,079 --> 07:59:03,214
IS GOING MAKE THE ACCUSATION, 

14890
07:59:03,214 --> 07:59:06,117
THEY NEED TO COME FORWARD TO 

14891
07:59:06,117 --> 07:59:06,951
SOME CORROBORATION, NOT JUST 

14892
07:59:06,951 --> 07:59:07,351
ALLEGATIONS. 

14893
07:59:07,351 --> 07:59:08,786
YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY. 

14894
07:59:08,786 --> 07:59:12,256
ABOUT THE DELAYS IN YOUR 

14895
07:59:12,256 --> 07:59:13,090
ABILITY TO COME HERE AND 

14896
07:59:13,090 --> 07:59:13,891
PROTECT YOUR GOOD NAME. 

14897
07:59:13,891 --> 07:59:16,494
BECAUSE IN THE INTERIM, IT JUST 

14898
07:59:16,494 --> 07:59:17,962
KEEPS GETTING WORSE. 

14899
07:59:17,962 --> 07:59:22,633
IT IS NOT DR. FORD. 

14900
07:59:22,633 --> 07:59:24,268
IT IS THE STORY THAT OUT OF THE 

14901
07:59:24,268 --> 07:59:25,369
NEW YORK TIMES WOULD REPORT. 

14902
07:59:25,369 --> 07:59:26,804
THE ALLEGATION OF MS. RAMIREZ, 

14903
07:59:26,804 --> 07:59:33,744
AND THEN STORMY DANIELS LAWYER. 

14904
07:59:33,744 --> 07:59:34,578
COMES UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE 

14905
07:59:34,578 --> 07:59:36,013
STORY, ACCUSING YOU OF THE MOST 

14906
07:59:36,013 --> 07:59:37,148
SORDID AND SALACIOUS CONDUCT. 

14907
07:59:37,148 --> 07:59:39,250
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. 

14908
07:59:39,250 --> 07:59:41,586
YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY. 

14909
07:59:41,586 --> 07:59:44,255
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO TELL 

14910
07:59:44,255 --> 07:59:44,555
YOUR STORY. 

14911
07:59:44,555 --> 07:59:45,790
I HOPE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO 

14912
07:59:45,790 --> 07:59:48,593
TELL US EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO 

14913
07:59:48,593 --> 07:59:49,927
TELL US. 

14914
07:59:49,927 --> 08:00:13,551
THE BURDEN IS NOT 

14915
08:00:13,684 --> 08:00:14,652
>> IT'S HARD TO RECONSTRUCT 

14916
08:00:14,652 --> 08:00:16,921
WHAT HAPPENED 36 YEARS AGO AND 

14917
08:00:16,921 --> 08:00:22,493
I APPRECIATE THAT SHE HAS HAD 

14918
08:00:22,493 --> 08:00:23,794
AN INCIDENT AT SOME POINT IN 

14919
08:00:23,794 --> 08:00:26,364
HER LIFE. 

14920
08:00:26,364 --> 08:00:30,368
AND YOU ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THAT 

14921
08:00:30,368 --> 08:00:34,372
AND YOUR REPUTATION IS ON THE 

14922
08:00:34,372 --> 08:00:36,507
LINE. 

14923
08:00:36,507 --> 08:00:37,441
I HOPE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE 

14924
08:00:37,441 --> 08:00:38,409
GRAVITY OF THE CHARGES MADE 

14925
08:00:38,409 --> 08:00:40,278
AGAINST YOU AND WHAT A FAIR 

14926
08:00:40,278 --> 08:00:44,649
PROCESS LOOKS LIKE. 

14927
08:00:44,649 --> 08:00:46,217
>> SENATOR KLOBUCHAR? 

14928
08:00:46,217 --> 08:00:48,785
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, 

14929
08:00:48,785 --> 08:00:49,420
JUDGE. 

14930
08:00:49,420 --> 08:00:51,555
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DECENCY 

14931
08:00:51,555 --> 08:00:54,258
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THIS 

14932
08:00:54,258 --> 08:00:55,293
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO ADVISE 

14933
08:00:55,293 --> 08:00:55,760
AND CONSENT. 

14934
08:00:55,760 --> 08:00:57,395
FOR ME, WHEN THIS EVIDENCE CAME 

14935
08:00:57,395 --> 08:00:58,195
FORWARD, I DECIDED THAT I 

14936
08:00:58,195 --> 08:01:00,897
NEEDED TO LOOK AT THIS AND I 

14937
08:01:00,897 --> 08:01:04,035
NEEDED TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT AND 

14938
08:01:04,035 --> 08:01:06,269
I NEEDED TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS 

14939
08:01:06,269 --> 08:01:08,506
ABOUT IT AS WELL IS OTHERS THAT 

14940
08:01:08,506 --> 08:01:09,073
WERE INVOLVED. 

14941
08:01:09,073 --> 08:01:10,908
SO, AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO 

14942
08:01:10,908 --> 08:01:12,443
TAKE QUITE THE SAME APPROACH AS 

14943
08:01:12,443 --> 08:01:13,444
MY COLLEAGUES AND TALK ABOUT 

14944
08:01:13,444 --> 08:01:14,578
DON MCGAHN OR ANY OF THIS. 

14945
08:01:14,578 --> 08:01:15,846
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK THE 

14946
08:01:15,846 --> 08:01:21,152
PRESIDENT? 

14947
08:01:21,152 --> 08:01:22,619
DR. FORD CAN'T DO THIS. 

14948
08:01:22,619 --> 08:01:25,523
WE CLEARLY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO 

14949
08:01:25,523 --> 08:01:25,790
DO THIS. 

14950
08:01:25,790 --> 08:01:27,725
JUST AS THE PRESIDENT TO REOPEN 

14951
08:01:27,725 --> 08:01:28,359
THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 

14952
08:01:28,359 --> 08:01:30,361
>> I THINK THE COMMITTEE -- YOU 

14953
08:01:30,361 --> 08:01:32,763
ARE DOING THE INVESTIGATION. 

14954
08:01:32,763 --> 08:01:33,631
I'M HERE TO ANSWER YOUR 

14955
08:01:33,631 --> 08:01:33,931
QUESTIONS. 

14956
08:01:33,931 --> 08:01:38,903
I SHOULD SAY ONE THING, SENATOR 

14957
08:01:38,903 --> 08:01:39,203
KLOBUCHAR. 

14958
08:01:39,203 --> 08:01:40,371
I APPRECIATE OUR MEETING 

14959
08:01:40,371 --> 08:01:41,906
TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE HOW 

14960
08:01:41,906 --> 08:01:42,740
YOU HANDLED THE PRIOR HEARING 

14961
08:01:42,740 --> 08:01:44,007
AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR 

14962
08:01:44,007 --> 08:01:44,642
YOU. 

14963
08:01:44,642 --> 08:01:47,011
>> THANK YOU. 

14964
08:01:47,011 --> 08:01:48,145
ALL OF THAT ASIDE, HERE'S THE 

14965
08:01:48,145 --> 08:01:48,379
THING. 

14966
08:01:48,379 --> 08:01:54,151
YOU COULD ACTUALLY JUST GET 

14967
08:01:54,151 --> 08:01:56,020
THIS OPEN SO THAT WE CAN TALK 

14968
08:01:56,020 --> 08:01:58,489
TO THESE WITNESSES AND THE FBI 

14969
08:01:58,489 --> 08:02:00,291
CAN DO IT INSTEAD OF US. 

14970
08:02:00,291 --> 08:02:03,294
YOU'VE COME BEFORE US BUT WE 

14971
08:02:03,294 --> 08:02:04,895
HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MARK JUDGE, 

14972
08:02:04,895 --> 08:02:06,464
WHO DR. FORD SAYS WAS A WITNESS 

14973
08:02:06,464 --> 08:02:06,731
TO THIS. 

14974
08:02:06,731 --> 08:02:08,032
WE HAVE THIS POLYGRAPH EXPERT 

14975
08:02:08,032 --> 08:02:12,002
THAT MY COLLEAGUES WERE RAISING 

14976
08:02:12,002 --> 08:02:13,003
ISSUES ABOUT THAT. 

14977
08:02:13,003 --> 08:02:15,139
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT 

14978
08:02:15,139 --> 08:02:16,707
PERSON COME BEFORE US. 

14979
08:02:16,707 --> 08:02:18,876
I JUST THINK IF WE COULD OPEN 

14980
08:02:18,876 --> 08:02:21,479
THIS UP -- >> I DON'T MEAN TO 

14981
08:02:21,479 --> 08:02:22,380
INTERRUPT. 

14982
08:02:22,380 --> 08:02:23,547
BUT, I GUESS I AM. 

14983
08:02:23,547 --> 08:02:25,249
WITH MARK JUDGE HAS PROVIDED 

14984
08:02:25,249 --> 08:02:25,950
SWORN STATEMENTS SAYING THIS 

14985
08:02:25,950 --> 08:02:27,284
DIDN'T HAPPEN IN AND THAT I 

14986
08:02:27,284 --> 08:02:29,519
NEVER DID OR WOULD DO -- 

14987
08:02:29,519 --> 08:02:32,390
>> WE WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO 

14988
08:02:32,390 --> 08:02:34,959
FOLLOW UP AND ASK THEM 

14989
08:02:34,959 --> 08:02:35,259
QUESTIONS. 

14990
08:02:35,259 --> 08:02:38,829
YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT PAST 

14991
08:02:38,829 --> 08:02:39,930
NOMINATION PROCESSES AND YOU 

14992
08:02:39,930 --> 08:02:40,397
TALKED ABOUT THOSE. 

14993
08:02:40,397 --> 08:02:41,399
I NOTE THAT PRESIDENT GEORGE 

14994
08:02:41,399 --> 08:02:46,369
BUSH, IN THE ANITA HILL/JUSTICE 

14995
08:02:46,369 --> 08:02:47,638
THOMAS CASE, HE OPENED UP THE 

14996
08:02:47,638 --> 08:02:51,008
FBI INVESTIGATION AND LET 

14997
08:02:51,008 --> 08:02:53,210
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED. 

14998
08:02:53,210 --> 08:02:55,112
I THINK IT WAS HELPFUL FOR 

14999
08:02:55,112 --> 08:02:55,713
PEOPLE. 

15000
08:02:55,713 --> 08:02:56,814
WAS HIS DECISION REASONABLE? 

15001
08:02:56,814 --> 08:02:58,916
>> I DON'T KNOW THE 

15002
08:02:58,916 --> 08:03:00,084
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT. 

15003
08:03:00,084 --> 08:03:01,718
WHAT I NO, SENATOR -- 

15004
08:03:01,718 --> 08:03:03,554
>> THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THAT 

15005
08:03:03,554 --> 08:03:04,789
HE OPENED UP THE INVESTIGATION 

15006
08:03:04,789 --> 08:03:06,857
SO THE FBI COULD ASK SOME 

15007
08:03:06,857 --> 08:03:07,157
QUESTIONS. 

15008
08:03:07,157 --> 08:03:07,891
HE OPENED UP THE BACKGROUND 

15009
08:03:07,891 --> 08:03:08,124
CHECK. 

15010
08:03:08,124 --> 08:03:08,959
>> I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 

15011
08:03:08,959 --> 08:03:11,729
ABOUT MY YEARBOOK OR ABOUT --

15012
08:03:11,729 --> 08:03:18,302
>> OKAY. 

15013
08:03:18,302 --> 08:03:20,905
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE 

15014
08:03:20,905 --> 08:03:21,172
YEARBOOK. 

15015
08:03:21,172 --> 08:03:24,542
SO, MOST PEOPLE HAVE DONE SOME 

15016
08:03:24,542 --> 08:03:26,076
DRINKING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND 

15017
08:03:26,076 --> 08:03:27,978
COLLEGE AND MANY PEOPLE EVEN 

15018
08:03:27,978 --> 08:03:28,578
STRUGGLE WITH ALCOHOLISM AND 

15019
08:03:28,578 --> 08:03:28,979
BINGE DRINKING. 

15020
08:03:28,979 --> 08:03:29,847
MY OWN DAD STRUGGLED WITH 

15021
08:03:29,847 --> 08:03:34,085
ALCOHOLISM MOST OF HIS LIFE AND 

15022
08:03:34,085 --> 08:03:37,388
HE GOT IN TROUBLE FOR IT AND 

15023
08:03:37,388 --> 08:03:38,121
THERE WERE CONSEQUENCES. 

15024
08:03:38,121 --> 08:03:40,491
HE IS STILL IN AA AT AGED 90 

15025
08:03:40,491 --> 08:03:41,091
AND HE'S SOBER. 

15026
08:03:41,091 --> 08:03:44,762
IN HIS WORDS, HE WAS PURSUED BY 

15027
08:03:44,762 --> 08:03:46,831
GRACE AND THAT'S HOW HE GOT 

15028
08:03:46,831 --> 08:03:47,164
THROUGH THIS. 

15029
08:03:47,164 --> 08:03:48,099
IN YOUR CASE, YOU HAVE SAID 

15030
08:03:48,099 --> 08:03:50,935
HERE AND OTHER PLACES THAT YOU 

15031
08:03:50,935 --> 08:03:54,071
NEVER DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU 

15032
08:03:54,071 --> 08:03:55,306
DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. 

15033
08:03:55,306 --> 08:03:57,908
YET, WE HAVE HEARD, NOT UNDER 

15034
08:03:57,908 --> 08:03:59,377
OATH, BUT WE HAVE HEARD YOUR 

15035
08:03:59,377 --> 08:04:00,811
COLLEGE ROOMMATE SAY THAT YOU 

15036
08:04:00,811 --> 08:04:01,278
DID DRINK FREQUENTLY. 

15037
08:04:01,278 --> 08:04:02,413
THESE ARE IN NEWS REPORTS, THAT 

15038
08:04:02,413 --> 08:04:04,482
YOU WOULD SOMETIMES BE 

15039
08:04:04,482 --> 08:04:09,019
BELLIGERENT. ANOTHER CLASSMATE 

15040
08:04:09,019 --> 08:04:10,488
SAID IT'S NOT CREDIBLE FOR YOU 

15041
08:04:10,488 --> 08:04:13,090
TO SAY YOU DIDN'T HAVE MEMORY 

15042
08:04:13,090 --> 08:04:13,323
LAPSES. 

15043
08:04:13,323 --> 08:04:15,192
SO, DRINKING IS ONE THING -- 

15044
08:04:15,192 --> 08:04:17,094
>> I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT 

15045
08:04:17,094 --> 08:04:19,763
IS THE SECOND QUOTE AS CORRECT. 

15046
08:04:19,763 --> 08:04:21,999
THE FIRST QUOTE, IF YOU WANTED, 

15047
08:04:21,999 --> 08:04:23,801
I PROVIDED SOME MATERIAL THAT 

15048
08:04:23,801 --> 08:04:24,802
IS STILL REDACTED ABOUT THE 

15049
08:04:24,802 --> 08:04:26,470
SITUATION WITH THE FRESHMAN 

15050
08:04:26,470 --> 08:04:27,004
YEAR ROOMMATE. 

15051
08:04:27,004 --> 08:04:29,140
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO REPEAT 

15052
08:04:29,140 --> 08:04:30,708
THAT IN A PUBLIC HEARING. úJUST 

15053
08:04:30,708 --> 08:04:33,177
THREE PEOPLE IN A ROOM. DAVE 

15054
08:04:33,177 --> 08:04:37,080
WHITE, JAMIE ROACH AND ME AND 

15055
08:04:37,080 --> 08:04:38,015
IT WAS A CONTENTIOUS SITUATION 

15056
08:04:38,015 --> 08:04:38,915
WHERE JAMIE DID NOT LIKE DAVE 

15057
08:04:38,915 --> 08:04:48,325
WHITE AT ALL. 

15058
08:04:48,325 --> 08:04:49,493
SO, DAVE WHITE CAME BACK FROM 

15059
08:04:49,493 --> 08:04:50,327
HOME ONE WEEKEND AND JAMIE 

15060
08:04:50,327 --> 08:04:54,932
ROACH HAD MOVED ALL HIS 

15061
08:04:54,932 --> 08:04:57,301
FURNITURE OUT INTO THE 

15062
08:04:57,301 --> 08:04:57,601
COURTYARD. 

15063
08:04:57,601 --> 08:04:59,270
SO, HE WALKED IN AND THAT WAS 

15064
08:04:59,270 --> 08:05:00,203
YOUR SOURCE ON THAT. 

15065
08:05:00,203 --> 08:05:01,705
>> DRINKING IS ONE THING -- 

15066
08:05:01,705 --> 08:05:03,507
>> THERE'S MUCH MORE. 

15067
08:05:03,507 --> 08:05:04,475
LOOK AT THE REDACTED PORTION OF 

15068
08:05:04,475 --> 08:05:06,610
WHAT I SAID. I 

15069
08:05:06,610 --> 08:05:08,913
DON'T WANT TO REPEAT IT IN A 

15070
08:05:08,913 --> 08:05:09,613
PUBLIC HEARING. 

15071
08:05:09,613 --> 08:05:09,913
>> I WILL. 

15072
08:05:09,913 --> 08:05:12,382
>> THE REDACTED INFORMATION -- 

15073
08:05:12,382 --> 08:05:14,118
>> DRINKING IS ONE THING BUT 

15074
08:05:14,118 --> 08:05:15,186
THE CONCERN IS ABOUT 

15075
08:05:15,186 --> 08:05:16,020
TRUTHFULNESS AND IN YOUR 

15076
08:05:16,020 --> 08:05:16,687
WRITTEN TESTIMONY YOU SAID 

15077
08:05:16,687 --> 08:05:19,023
SOMETIMES YOU HAD TOO MANY 

15078
08:05:19,023 --> 08:05:19,256
DRINKS. 

15079
08:05:19,256 --> 08:05:20,458
WAS THERE EVER A TIME WHEN YOU 

15080
08:05:20,458 --> 08:05:21,559
DRINK SO MUCH THAT YOU COULDN'T 

15081
08:05:21,559 --> 08:05:22,493
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED OR PART 

15082
08:05:22,493 --> 08:05:23,861
OF WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT 

15083
08:05:23,861 --> 08:05:24,094
BEFORE? 

15084
08:05:24,094 --> 08:05:24,328
>> NO. 

15085
08:05:24,328 --> 08:05:28,999
I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. 

15086
08:05:28,999 --> 08:05:30,100
I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD 

15087
08:05:30,100 --> 08:05:34,371
BEERS, SENATOR. 

15088
08:05:34,371 --> 08:05:36,106
>> YOU ARE SAYING THERE HAS 

15089
08:05:36,106 --> 08:05:37,274
NEVER BEEN A CASE WHERE YOU 

15090
08:05:37,274 --> 08:05:39,276
DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU DIDN'T 

15091
08:05:39,276 --> 08:05:40,444
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE 

15092
08:05:40,444 --> 08:05:42,646
NIGHT BEFORE OR PART OF WHAT 

15093
08:05:42,646 --> 08:05:42,913
HAPPENED? 

15094
08:05:42,913 --> 08:05:45,182
>> YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT A 

15095
08:05:45,182 --> 08:05:45,449
BLACKOUT. 

15096
08:05:45,449 --> 08:05:45,982
I DON'T KNOW, HAVE YOU? 

15097
08:05:45,982 --> 08:05:47,117
>> COULD YOU ANSWER THE 

15098
08:05:47,117 --> 08:05:51,822
QUESTION, JUDGE? 

15099
08:05:51,822 --> 08:05:54,825
THAT'S NOT HAPPEN, IS THAT YOUR 

15100
08:05:54,825 --> 08:05:55,058
ANSWER? 

15101
08:05:55,058 --> 08:05:55,793
>> YES. 

15102
08:05:55,793 --> 08:05:57,394
I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE. 

15103
08:05:57,394 --> 08:06:00,664
>> I HAVE NO DRINKING PROBLEM, 

15104
08:06:00,664 --> 08:06:00,897
JUDGE. 

15105
08:06:00,897 --> 08:06:01,565
>> NOR DO I. 

15106
08:06:01,565 --> 08:06:02,366
>> OKAY. 

15107
08:06:02,366 --> 08:06:03,033
THANK YOU. 

15108
08:06:03,033 --> 08:06:05,603
>> SENATOR HATCH, SINCE THIS 

15109
08:06:05,603 --> 08:06:07,004
FBI THING KEEPS COMING UP ALL 

15110
08:06:07,004 --> 08:06:09,373
THE TIME, LET'S GET BACK TO 

15111
08:06:09,373 --> 08:06:10,007
BASICS. 

15112
08:06:10,007 --> 08:06:15,513
FIRST OF ALL, ANYBODY, 

15113
08:06:15,513 --> 08:06:17,414
INCLUDING ANY SENATOR THAT 

15114
08:06:17,414 --> 08:06:18,915
BROUGHT UP THIS ISSUE, COULD 

15115
08:06:18,915 --> 08:06:20,918
ASK FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

15116
08:06:20,918 --> 08:06:22,653
WHAT THE FBI DOES IS GATHER 

15117
08:06:22,653 --> 08:06:24,454
INFORMATION FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 

15118
08:06:24,454 --> 08:06:26,890
AND THEN THE FILE IS SENT TO 

15119
08:06:26,890 --> 08:06:29,026
THE COMMITTEE FOR US TO MAKE 

15120
08:06:29,026 --> 08:06:30,127
OUR OWN EVALUATIONS. 

15121
08:06:30,127 --> 08:06:32,596
WE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING OUR 

15122
08:06:32,596 --> 08:06:33,430
OWN DETERMINATION ABOUT THE 

15123
08:06:33,430 --> 08:06:34,264
ACCURACY OF ANY OF THOSE 

15124
08:06:34,264 --> 08:06:34,597
ALLEGATIONS. 

15125
08:06:34,597 --> 08:06:39,703
THE FBI HAS PUT OUT A STATEMENT 

15126
08:06:39,703 --> 08:06:41,205
-- I SUPPOSE IT IS A MONTH AGO 

15127
08:06:41,205 --> 08:06:42,373
-- CLEARLY STATING THIS MATTER 

15128
08:06:42,373 --> 08:06:43,307
IS CLOSED, AS FAR AS THE LETTER 

15129
08:06:43,307 --> 08:06:45,743
BEING SENT TO THEM. 

15130
08:06:45,743 --> 08:06:47,143
THERE IS NO FEDERAL CRIME TO 

15131
08:06:47,143 --> 08:06:54,485
INVESTIGATE IF SENATE DEMOCRATS 

15132
08:06:54,485 --> 08:06:56,086
HOPE FOR THE FBI TO DRAW ANY 

15133
08:06:56,086 --> 08:06:57,253
CONCLUSIONS ON THIS MATTER. 

15134
08:06:57,253 --> 08:06:58,923
I'M GOING TO REMIND YOU WHAT 

15135
08:06:58,923 --> 08:07:00,157
JOE BIDEN SAID. 

15136
08:07:00,157 --> 08:07:02,826
I SAID THIS IN MY STATEMENT BUT 

15137
08:07:02,826 --> 08:07:04,995
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO 

15138
08:07:04,995 --> 08:07:07,031
WHAT I SAY AND MAYBE THEY WON'T 

15139
08:07:07,031 --> 08:07:08,299
EVEN HEAR THIS. 

15140
08:07:08,299 --> 08:07:10,734
JOE BIDEN, QUOTE, THE NEXT 

15141
08:07:10,734 --> 08:07:13,204
PERSON WHO REFERS TO AN FBI 

15142
08:07:13,204 --> 08:07:14,037
REPORT AS BEING WORTH ANYTHING, 

15143
08:07:14,037 --> 08:07:14,671
OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAD 

15144
08:07:14,671 --> 08:07:14,938
ANYTHING. 

15145
08:07:14,938 --> 08:07:19,310
THE FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN 

15146
08:07:19,310 --> 08:07:20,611
THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE, REACH A 

15147
08:07:20,611 --> 08:07:22,479
CONCLUSION, PERIOD. 

15148
08:07:22,479 --> 08:07:29,486
THEY SAY, HE SAID, SHE SAID, 

15149
08:07:29,486 --> 08:07:30,921
THEY SAID, PERIOD. 

15150
08:07:30,921 --> 08:07:31,722
WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE AND FBI 

15151
08:07:31,722 --> 08:07:33,357
REPORT BEFORE YOU OR EVEN BRING 

15152
08:07:33,357 --> 08:07:34,424
IT UP NOW AS SOMETHING 

15153
08:07:34,424 --> 08:07:38,796
PROSPECTIVELY -- THAT WASN'T IN 

15154
08:07:38,796 --> 08:07:39,863
HIS QUOTE -- UNDERSTAND, THEY 

15155
08:07:39,863 --> 08:07:41,030
DO NOT, THEY DO NOT, THEY DO 

15156
08:07:41,030 --> 08:07:45,836
NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS. 

15157
08:07:45,836 --> 08:07:46,270
THEY DO NOT MAKE 

15158
08:07:46,270 --> 08:07:46,670
RECOMMENDATIONS. 

15159
08:07:46,670 --> 08:07:47,037
SENATOR HATCH? 

15160
08:07:47,037 --> 08:07:54,044
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 

15161
08:07:54,044 --> 08:07:54,377
MR. CHAIRMAN? 

15162
08:07:54,377 --> 08:07:56,880
MAY I SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT, 

15163
08:07:56,880 --> 08:07:57,847
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE ASKED. 

15164
08:07:57,847 --> 08:07:59,650
YOU SAID NOBODY HAS ASKED THE 

15165
08:07:59,650 --> 08:08:02,720
FBI OR WE COULD ASK THE FBI. 

15166
08:08:02,720 --> 08:08:03,988
I ACTUALLY HAVE. I 

15167
08:08:03,988 --> 08:08:06,423
THINK OTHERS HAVE IN THE ISSUE 

15168
08:08:06,423 --> 08:08:08,592
IS THAT PART OF WHAT THE FBI 

15169
08:08:08,592 --> 08:08:10,027
REPORT DOES IS TO INVESTIGATE 

15170
08:08:10,027 --> 08:08:11,729
AND SEEK EITHER CORROBORATING 

15171
08:08:11,729 --> 08:08:13,063
OR EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. 

15172
08:08:13,063 --> 08:08:14,965
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE CONCLUSION 

15173
08:08:14,965 --> 08:08:17,568
IT DRAWS AS THE BREADTH OF THE 

15174
08:08:17,568 --> 08:08:18,402
EVIDENCE THAT IS SOUGHT OUT 

15175
08:08:18,402 --> 08:08:19,670
THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION AND 

15176
08:08:19,670 --> 08:08:28,479
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT 

15177
08:08:28,479 --> 08:08:29,580
SOMEBODY MIGHT SAY TO AN FBI 

15178
08:08:29,580 --> 08:08:30,613
AGENT WHEN THEY ARE BEING 

15179
08:08:30,613 --> 08:08:30,880
EXAMINED. 

15180
08:08:30,880 --> 08:08:31,414
FOR INSTANCE, MR. JUDGE'S 

15181
08:08:31,414 --> 08:08:32,316
LETTER SIGNED BY HIS LAWYER 

15182
08:08:32,316 --> 08:08:34,485
SENT IN, IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT 

15183
08:08:34,485 --> 08:08:35,018
THING. 

15184
08:08:35,018 --> 08:08:37,020
I BELIEVE, STILL, THAT THIS IS 

15185
08:08:37,020 --> 08:08:37,687
THE FIRST BACKGROUND 

15186
08:08:37,687 --> 08:08:38,756
INVESTIGATION IN THE HISTORY OF 

15187
08:08:38,756 --> 08:08:39,390
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS THAT 

15188
08:08:39,390 --> 08:08:40,724
HASN'T BEEN REOPENED WHEN NEW 

15189
08:08:40,724 --> 08:08:41,358
CREDIBLE DEROGATORY INFORMATION 

15190
08:08:41,358 --> 08:08:48,365
WAS RAISED ABOUT THE SUBJECT, 

15191
08:08:48,365 --> 08:08:48,832
ABOUT THE NOMINEE. 

15192
08:08:48,832 --> 08:08:50,334
YOU KNOW, I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO 

15193
08:08:50,334 --> 08:08:52,536
LET THE POINT YOU MADE STAND 

15194
08:08:52,536 --> 08:08:55,439
WITHOUT REFERENCING WHAT WE HAVE

15195
08:08:55,439 --> 08:08:56,206
TRIED TO DO. 

15196
08:08:56,206 --> 08:08:58,075
>> PARDON ME. I 

15197
08:08:58,075 --> 08:08:59,609
WILL ADD TO THE POINT YOU MADE. 

15198
08:08:59,609 --> 08:09:02,746
THE LETTER WAS SENT TO THE FBI. 

15199
08:09:02,746 --> 08:09:04,481
THE FBI SENT IT TO THE WHITE 

15200
08:09:04,481 --> 08:09:06,049
HOUSE WITH A LETTER SAYING THE 

15201
08:09:06,049 --> 08:09:06,382
CASES CLOSED. 

15202
08:09:06,382 --> 08:09:07,684
WE ARE TAKING A BREAK, NOW, 

15203
08:09:07,684 --> 08:09:07,951
SENATOR. 

15204
08:09:07,951 --> 08:09:09,887
WE ARE TAKING A BREAK NOW. 

15205
08:09:09,887 --> 08:09:25,702
>> A 15 MINUTE BREAK. 

15206
08:09:25,702 --> 08:09:26,103
>> OKAY. 

15207
08:09:26,103 --> 08:09:28,405
ANOTHER BREAK IN THE KAVANAUGH 

15208
08:09:28,405 --> 08:09:32,176
HEARINGS. 

15209
08:09:32,176 --> 08:09:33,677
THE SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN, 

15210
08:09:33,677 --> 08:09:34,645
CHUCK GRASSLEY, JUST CALLED FOR 

15211
08:09:34,645 --> 08:09:36,647
IT AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ADVISED 

15212
08:09:36,647 --> 08:09:38,816
HOW LONG THAT BREAK WILL BE BUT 

15213
08:09:38,816 --> 08:09:40,484
WELCOME BACK TO THOSE OF YOU 

15214
08:09:40,484 --> 08:09:40,751
WATCHING. 

15215
08:09:40,751 --> 08:09:44,521
YOU BEEN WATCHING THE SENATE 

15216
08:09:44,521 --> 08:09:44,988
JUDICIARY HEARINGS. 

15217
08:09:44,988 --> 08:09:46,423
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, 

15218
08:09:46,423 --> 08:09:47,458
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS 

15219
08:09:47,458 --> 08:09:48,659
DENIED FORCEFULLY THAT HE 

15220
08:09:48,659 --> 08:09:49,326
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHRISTINE 

15221
08:09:49,326 --> 08:09:51,161
BLASEY FORD WHEN THEY WERE 

15222
08:09:51,161 --> 08:09:51,461
TEENAGERS. 

15223
08:09:51,461 --> 08:09:52,963
WE WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU, 

15224
08:09:52,963 --> 08:09:53,764
PERHAPS, THE MOST EMOTIONAL 

15225
08:09:53,764 --> 08:09:58,568
MOMENT OF THE DAY OUTSIDE OF THE

15226
08:09:58,568 --> 08:10:01,371
KAVANAUGH TESTIMONY, WE SHOULD 

15227
08:10:01,371 --> 08:10:02,639
SAY, WHICH CAME SHORTLY AFTER 

15228
08:10:02,639 --> 08:10:02,939
THAT ENDED. 

15229
08:10:02,939 --> 08:10:04,408
THAT WAS REPUBLICAN SENATOR 

15230
08:10:04,408 --> 08:10:04,941
LINDSEY GRAHAM. 

15231
08:10:04,941 --> 08:10:07,478
WE WILL DIGEST A LOT OF THIS IN 

15232
08:10:07,478 --> 08:10:09,079
JUST A MOMENT AND PLAY MORE 

15233
08:10:09,079 --> 08:10:09,980
SOUND BEYOND THIS. 

15234
08:10:09,980 --> 08:10:13,150
LET'S START WITH SOME OF THAT 

15235
08:10:13,150 --> 08:10:14,618
LINDSEY GRAHAM AUDIO BECAUSE 

15236
08:10:14,618 --> 08:10:15,786
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN 

15237
08:10:15,786 --> 08:10:16,353
REACTING TO IT. 

15238
08:10:16,353 --> 08:10:17,821
>> IF YOU WANTED THE FBI 

15239
08:10:17,821 --> 08:10:19,857
INVESTIGATION, YOU COULD HAVE 

15240
08:10:19,857 --> 08:10:20,390
COME TO US. 

15241
08:10:20,390 --> 08:10:22,426
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY 

15242
08:10:22,426 --> 08:10:25,095
THIS GUY'S LIFE, HOLD THIS SEAT 

15243
08:10:25,095 --> 08:10:26,830
OPEN AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020. 

15244
08:10:26,830 --> 08:10:27,631
YOU'VE SAID THAT! 

15245
08:10:27,631 --> 08:10:27,864
NOT ME. 

15246
08:10:27,864 --> 08:10:29,500
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE 

15247
08:10:29,500 --> 08:10:29,700
FOR. 

15248
08:10:29,700 --> 08:10:36,340
WHEN YOU SEE SOTOMAYOR AND 

15249
08:10:36,340 --> 08:10:37,975
KAGAN, TELL THEM LINDSAY SAID 

15250
08:10:37,975 --> 08:10:39,510
HELLO BECAUSE I VOTED FOR THEM. 

15251
08:10:39,510 --> 08:10:40,978
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT 

15252
08:10:40,978 --> 08:10:41,912
YOU'VE DONE TO THIS GUY. 

15253
08:10:41,912 --> 08:10:43,380
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM 

15254
08:10:43,380 --> 08:10:48,551
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS. IF 

15255
08:10:48,551 --> 08:10:50,888
YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW THE 

15256
08:10:50,888 --> 08:10:52,756
TRUTH, YOU SURE AS WOULDN'T 

15257
08:10:52,756 --> 08:10:54,424
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO 

15258
08:10:54,424 --> 08:10:54,691
THIS GUY. 

15259
08:10:54,691 --> 08:10:58,529
ARE YOU A GANG RAPIST? 

15260
08:10:58,529 --> 08:11:00,731
NO. 

15261
08:11:00,731 --> 08:11:01,799
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND 

15262
08:11:01,799 --> 08:11:06,236
YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH. 

15263
08:11:06,236 --> 08:11:08,839
YOU WANT POWER, I HOPE YOU NEVER

15264
08:11:08,839 --> 08:11:09,439
GET IT. 

15265
08:11:09,439 --> 08:11:10,807
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN 

15266
08:11:10,807 --> 08:11:11,909
SEE THROUGH THIS SHAM. 

15267
08:11:11,909 --> 08:11:13,310
THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU 

15268
08:11:13,310 --> 08:11:13,577
HELD IT. 

15269
08:11:13,577 --> 08:11:17,781
YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF PRETEND

15270
08:11:17,781 --> 08:11:19,116
-- OF PROTECTING DR. FORD. 

15271
08:11:19,116 --> 08:11:19,316
NONE. 

15272
08:11:19,316 --> 08:11:21,918
SHE IS AS MUCH A VICTIM AS YOU 

15273
08:11:21,918 --> 08:11:22,119
ARE. 

15274
08:11:22,119 --> 08:11:23,687
GOD I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE 

15275
08:11:23,687 --> 08:11:24,888
THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS. 

15276
08:11:24,888 --> 08:11:27,057
LET ME TELL YOU WHEN IT COMES 

15277
08:11:27,057 --> 08:11:32,162
TO THIS, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 

15278
08:11:32,162 --> 08:11:33,796
FAIR PROCESS, YOU CAME TO THE 

15279
08:11:33,796 --> 08:11:35,299
WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, 

15280
08:11:35,299 --> 08:11:35,599
MY FRIEND. 

15281
08:11:35,599 --> 08:11:38,936
DO YOU CONSIDER THIS A JOB 

15282
08:11:38,936 --> 08:11:40,437
INTERVIEW? 

15283
08:11:40,437 --> 08:11:42,239
>> THE ADVICE AND CONSENT ROLE 

15284
08:11:42,239 --> 08:11:43,640
IS LIKE A JOB. 

15285
08:11:43,640 --> 08:11:45,075
>> YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU'VE 

15286
08:11:45,075 --> 08:11:47,043
BEEN TO A JOB INTERVIEW. 

15287
08:11:47,043 --> 08:11:49,446
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH A PROCESS 

15288
08:11:49,446 --> 08:11:51,481
OF ADVICE AND CONSENT UNDER THE 

15289
08:11:51,481 --> 08:11:51,882
CONSTITUTION. 

15290
08:11:51,882 --> 08:11:53,083
>> WOULD YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN 

15291
08:11:53,083 --> 08:11:53,416
THROUGH HECK? 

15292
08:11:53,416 --> 08:11:57,387
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH HECK AND 

15293
08:11:57,387 --> 08:11:57,888
THEN SOME. 

15294
08:11:57,888 --> 08:11:59,456
>> THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW, 

15295
08:11:59,456 --> 08:12:00,824
THIS IS HELD. 

15296
08:12:00,824 --> 08:12:01,792
THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY THE 

15297
08:12:01,792 --> 08:12:03,026
ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO COME 

15298
08:12:03,026 --> 08:12:03,927
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS CRAP. 

15299
08:12:03,927 --> 08:12:11,502
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK. YOU 

15300
08:12:11,502 --> 08:12:11,969
HAVE INTERACTED WITH 

15301
08:12:11,969 --> 08:12:12,669
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ALL YOUR 

15302
08:12:12,669 --> 08:12:13,303
LIFE. 

15303
08:12:13,303 --> 08:12:20,677
NOT ONE ACCUSATION. 

15304
08:12:20,677 --> 08:12:23,013
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS THE FIRST 

15305
08:12:23,013 --> 08:12:25,916
GOP SENATOR TO ASK QUESTIONS 

15306
08:12:25,916 --> 08:12:27,518
AND NOT DEFER TO THE PROSECUTOR 

15307
08:12:27,518 --> 08:12:28,819
THE REPUBLICANS HAD SELECTED 

15308
08:12:28,819 --> 08:12:30,587
WHO DID THE EARLIER QUESTIONING 

15309
08:12:30,587 --> 08:12:31,554
OF CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 

15310
08:12:31,554 --> 08:12:33,857
THE PRESIDENT SAID AT HIS NEWS 

15311
08:12:33,857 --> 08:12:35,025
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY HE WOULD 

15312
08:12:35,025 --> 08:12:36,527
BE WATCHING HEARINGS TODAY AND 

15313
08:12:36,527 --> 08:12:38,061
HE IS AN OFFICIAL AT THE WHITE 

15314
08:12:38,061 --> 08:12:38,294
HOUSE. 

15315
08:12:38,294 --> 08:12:40,530
THEY NOW TELL US THEY ARE 

15316
08:12:40,530 --> 08:12:44,134
PLEASED WITH KAVANAUGH'S STRONG 

15317
08:12:44,134 --> 08:12:45,235
FULL THROATED RESPONSE. 

15318
08:12:45,235 --> 08:12:46,870
IT'S A TOWN THEY SAID THEY HAVE 

15319
08:12:46,870 --> 08:12:48,271
BEEN WAITING FOR FROM HIM. 

15320
08:12:48,271 --> 08:12:49,306
WE'VE SEEN AND NUMBER OF TWEETS 

15321
08:12:49,306 --> 08:12:50,807
GOING OUT FROM VARIOUS MEMBERS 

15322
08:12:50,807 --> 08:12:51,741
OF THE WHITE HOUSE ENDORSING 

15323
08:12:51,741 --> 08:12:54,978
WHAT THEY'VE HEARD, SO FAR FROM 

15324
08:12:54,978 --> 08:12:55,979
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

15325
08:12:55,979 --> 08:13:03,854
JOINING ME IN OUR COVERAGE, NOW 

15326
08:13:03,854 --> 08:13:06,089
WE HAVE BIANNA GOLODRYGA, 

15327
08:13:06,089 --> 08:13:07,658
COHOST JOHN DICKERSON, JAN 

15328
08:13:07,658 --> 08:13:09,292
CRAWFORD WHO COVERS A SUPREME 

15329
08:13:09,292 --> 08:13:10,761
COURT AND THE NEWS ANALYST, 

15330
08:13:10,761 --> 08:13:12,696
RIKKI KLEIMAN AND OUR POLITICAL 

15331
08:13:12,696 --> 08:13:13,296
CORRESPONDENT, ED O'KEEFE, 

15332
08:13:13,296 --> 08:13:14,431
OUTSIDE THE HEARING ROOM AND 

15333
08:13:14,431 --> 08:13:14,931
TRYING TO GET WHATEVER 

15334
08:13:14,931 --> 08:13:29,246
INFORMATION FROM SENATORS. 

15335
08:13:29,246 --> 08:13:30,414
>> I THINK LINDSEY GRAHAM 

15336
08:13:30,414 --> 08:13:34,084
SPARED JUDGE KAVANAUGH A LOT OF 

15337
08:13:34,084 --> 08:13:41,224
THE EMOTIONS AND THEY WERE 

15338
08:13:41,224 --> 08:13:42,159
SHOWING LINDSEY GRAHAM HAVE WAS 

15339
08:13:42,159 --> 08:13:43,026
KNOWN TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN 

15340
08:13:43,026 --> 08:13:44,127
WHATEVER OPINION ON WHATEVER 

15341
08:13:44,127 --> 08:13:49,833
TOPIC. 

15342
08:13:49,833 --> 08:13:52,536
I KNOW YOU HAD A LOT OF 

15343
08:13:52,536 --> 08:13:53,670
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT LINDSAY, 

15344
08:13:53,670 --> 08:13:54,838
WHAT SENATOR GRAHAM WAS TRYING 

15345
08:13:54,838 --> 08:13:55,906
TO CONVEY IN HIS MESSAGE WITHIN 

15346
08:13:55,906 --> 08:13:56,840
THE PARTY AND OTHER REPUBLICANS 

15347
08:13:56,840 --> 08:13:58,175
WHO MAY BE ON THE FENCE ABOUT 

15348
08:13:58,175 --> 08:14:02,345
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. 

15349
08:14:02,345 --> 08:14:13,390
>> THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE TO 

15350
08:14:13,390 --> 08:14:15,025
FRAME POLITICALLY AND LINDSEY 

15351
08:14:15,025 --> 08:14:19,730
GRAHAM IN ADDITION TO THAT 

15352
08:14:19,730 --> 08:14:21,698
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE SAID TO 

15353
08:14:21,698 --> 08:14:23,567
FELLOW REPUBLICANS, IF YOU DON'T

15354
08:14:23,567 --> 08:14:25,802
VOTE FOR HIM, IF YOU VOTE 

15355
08:14:25,802 --> 08:14:27,070
AGAINST HIM YOU WILL CONFIRM 

15356
08:14:27,070 --> 08:14:28,472
AND VALIDATE WHAT LINDSEY 

15357
08:14:28,472 --> 08:14:29,339
GRAHAM JUST DESCRIBED, AND 

15358
08:14:29,339 --> 08:14:30,507
AWFUL PROCESS THAT RUINED A 

15359
08:14:30,507 --> 08:14:32,509
FAMILY THAT WEREN'T -- THAT 

15360
08:14:32,509 --> 08:14:34,077
RUINED A MAN. 

15361
08:14:34,077 --> 08:14:35,312
OF THIS IS ABOUT DETERMINING 

15362
08:14:35,312 --> 08:14:37,714
WHAT THE QUESTION IS, WHAT THE 

15363
08:14:37,714 --> 08:14:39,015
NARRATIVE IS, LINDSEY GRAHAM IS 

15364
08:14:39,015 --> 08:14:40,484
TRYING TO DO THAT FOR THE ON 

15365
08:14:40,484 --> 08:14:42,119
THE FENCE REPUBLICANS SAYING, 

15366
08:14:42,119 --> 08:14:45,188
THIS IS WHAT THE STAKES ARE. A 

15367
08:14:45,188 --> 08:14:46,757
VOTE AGAINST KAVANAUGH IS A 

15368
08:14:46,757 --> 08:14:48,125
VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE KIND OF 

15369
08:14:48,125 --> 08:14:50,160
SCORCHED EARTH POLITICS HE JUST 

15370
08:14:50,160 --> 08:14:50,894
DESCRIBED. 

15371
08:14:50,894 --> 08:14:53,163
AS JAN SAID EARLIER, THAT'S A 

15372
08:14:53,163 --> 08:14:55,098
MESSAGE TO THE REPUBLICAN BASE. 

15373
08:14:55,098 --> 08:14:57,334
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND 

15374
08:14:57,334 --> 08:14:58,268
ANY REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO 

15375
08:14:58,268 --> 08:14:58,969
CAVES TO THAT PRESSURE SHOULD 

15376
08:14:58,969 --> 08:14:59,469
BE PUNISHED. 

15377
08:14:59,469 --> 08:15:04,274
>> WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND WHAT 

15378
08:15:04,274 --> 08:15:06,276
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS SAYING, IF 

15379
08:15:06,276 --> 08:15:08,178
YOU VOTE AGAINST, YOU ARE 

15380
08:15:08,178 --> 08:15:08,611
ENDORSING CHARACTER 

15381
08:15:08,611 --> 08:15:08,978
ASSASSINATION? 

15382
08:15:08,978 --> 08:15:10,046
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

15383
08:15:10,046 --> 08:15:11,114
IT'S ABOUT FRAMING THE QUESTION 

15384
08:15:11,114 --> 08:15:12,181
AND THAT IS ABOUT POLITICS. 

15385
08:15:12,181 --> 08:15:13,250
HE WAS TRYING TO FRAME THE 

15386
08:15:13,250 --> 08:15:14,517
QUESTION FOR HIS OWN SIDE ANDI 

15387
08:15:14,517 --> 08:15:17,287
THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY 

15388
08:15:17,287 --> 08:15:19,055
EFFECTIVE. 

15389
08:15:19,055 --> 08:15:20,757
>> JAN? 

15390
08:15:20,757 --> 08:15:22,959
>> I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH 

15391
08:15:22,959 --> 08:15:24,227
REALLY LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR 

15392
08:15:24,227 --> 08:15:24,427
THAT. 

15393
08:15:24,427 --> 08:15:26,396
HE GAVE THAT OPENING STATEMENT 

15394
08:15:26,396 --> 08:15:30,801
AND AS THE REPORTERS SAID IN THE

15395
08:15:30,801 --> 08:15:33,303
ROOM, THE ROOM WAS JUST -- YOU 

15396
08:15:33,303 --> 08:15:34,137
COULD HEAR A PIN DROP. 

15397
08:15:34,137 --> 08:15:36,139
TO SEE THE EMOTION FROM HIM AND 

15398
08:15:36,139 --> 08:15:38,275
AS HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THIS 

15399
08:15:38,275 --> 08:15:40,076
HAD DONE TO HIM, HIS LIFE, HIS 

15400
08:15:40,076 --> 08:15:40,844
FAMILY, HIS PARENTS AND 

15401
08:15:40,844 --> 08:15:43,747
CHILDREN, THAT REALLY THEN SET 

15402
08:15:43,747 --> 08:15:44,548
THE GROUNDWORK FOR SENATOR 

15403
08:15:44,548 --> 08:15:46,383
GRAHAM'S QUITE FIERY AND 

15404
08:15:46,383 --> 08:15:50,287
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE, ENCOURAGING 

15405
08:15:50,287 --> 08:15:52,455
-- NOT ENCOURAGING -- FLAT OUT 

15406
08:15:52,455 --> 08:15:54,558
SAYING THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO 

15407
08:15:54,558 --> 08:15:56,159
VOTE AGAINST THIS MAN, NOT ONLY 

15408
08:15:56,159 --> 08:15:57,194
IS IT A VOTE FOR CHARACTER 

15409
08:15:57,194 --> 08:15:58,528
ASSASSINATION, BUT IT IS A VOTE 

15410
08:15:58,528 --> 08:16:02,432
FOR THE TACTICS THAT THE 

15411
08:16:02,432 --> 08:16:02,932
DEMOCRATS HAVE USED. 

15412
08:16:02,932 --> 08:16:05,468
HE CAME OUT OF THAT AND WHAT 

15413
08:16:05,468 --> 08:16:07,770
LED TO THIS WAS THE DEMOCRATS 

15414
08:16:07,770 --> 08:16:09,872
ARE PUSHING ABOUT THE FBI 

15415
08:16:09,872 --> 08:16:10,239
INVESTIGATION. 

15416
08:16:10,239 --> 08:16:12,209
SENATOR GRAHAM'S POINT, THIS IS 

15417
08:16:12,209 --> 08:16:12,509
RIDICULOUS. 

15418
08:16:12,509 --> 08:16:14,711
DEMOCRATS SAID ON THIS FOR TWO 

15419
08:16:14,711 --> 08:16:16,213
MONTHS AND WE COULD HAVE HAD 

15420
08:16:16,213 --> 08:16:18,348
THE FBI -- WE COULD HAVE HAD 

15421
08:16:18,348 --> 08:16:20,383
ALL KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS. 

15422
08:16:20,383 --> 08:16:22,252
THAT IS ALL SO THAT WHEN YOU 

15423
08:16:22,252 --> 08:16:23,687
SEE THIS WITH THE FBI 

15424
08:16:23,687 --> 08:16:25,388
INVESTIGATION, THAT GIVES THE 

15425
08:16:25,388 --> 08:16:27,424
REPUBLICANS A CHANCE TO SAY, YOU

15426
08:16:27,424 --> 08:16:29,125
SAT ON THIS FOR TWO MONTHS. 

15427
08:16:29,125 --> 08:16:30,426
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS TO BE 

15428
08:16:30,426 --> 08:16:30,927
CAREFUL. 

15429
08:16:30,927 --> 08:16:31,828
THERE'S ONE THING TO BE 

15430
08:16:31,828 --> 08:16:34,431
DEFENSIVE ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER 

15431
08:16:34,431 --> 08:16:36,566
AND IF HE BELIEVES HE WASN'T 

15432
08:16:36,566 --> 08:16:37,634
THERE AND DIDN'T DO THIS, BY 

15433
08:16:37,634 --> 08:16:38,401
ALL MEANS DEFEND YOUR ACTION 

15434
08:16:38,401 --> 08:16:40,904
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT HE DID IN 

15435
08:16:40,904 --> 08:16:41,972
COLLEGE, AND HIGH SCHOOL, HIS 

15436
08:16:41,972 --> 08:16:42,906
YEARBOOK AND HIS DRINKING AND 

15437
08:16:42,906 --> 08:16:43,640
THE FBI INVESTIGATION, THERE 

15438
08:16:43,640 --> 08:16:44,441
ARE TIMES WHERE HE APPROACHES 

15439
08:16:44,441 --> 08:16:50,914
THAT LINE-UP NOT GOING OVER 

15440
08:16:50,914 --> 08:16:53,083
THAT LINE OF BEING A BIT TOO 

15441
08:16:53,083 --> 08:16:53,383
DEFENSIVE. 

15442
08:16:53,383 --> 08:16:54,918
HAS NEVER ONCE SAID YES, I 

15443
08:16:54,918 --> 08:16:55,886
INVITE AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

15444
08:16:55,886 --> 08:16:57,721
HE SAID I WILL LET YOU DECIDE 

15445
08:16:57,721 --> 08:16:59,790
TO DO AND I WILL DO WHATEVER 

15446
08:16:59,790 --> 08:17:01,524
YOU TELL ME TO DO. 

15447
08:17:01,524 --> 08:17:03,460
I THINK THE DRINKING, DID YOU 

15448
08:17:03,460 --> 08:17:05,295
DRINK, DID YOU EVER BLANK OUT 

15449
08:17:05,295 --> 08:17:06,930
DRINK TO THE SENATORS ASKING 

15450
08:17:06,930 --> 08:17:07,330
THOSE QUESTIONS? 

15451
08:17:07,330 --> 08:17:09,032
THAT COULD TURN OUT TO BITE 

15452
08:17:09,032 --> 08:17:09,266
HIM. 

15453
08:17:09,266 --> 08:17:10,066
>> I THINK THAT'S TRUE. 

15454
08:17:10,066 --> 08:17:11,134
IT SHOWS EVASIVENESS IN REAL 

15455
08:17:11,134 --> 08:17:13,470
TIME. 

15456
08:17:13,470 --> 08:17:15,605
DICK DURBIN CAREFULLY TRIED TO 

15457
08:17:15,605 --> 08:17:17,674
PUT HIM IN THE CORNER AND SAID, 

15458
08:17:17,674 --> 08:17:19,409
JUST ASK THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER 

15459
08:17:19,409 --> 08:17:21,611
DON MCGAHN TO CALL IN THE FBI. 

15460
08:17:21,611 --> 08:17:23,847
THAT WAS A TACTIC, A TRICK. 

15461
08:17:23,847 --> 08:17:25,381
IN THE MOMENT WHEN KAVANAUGH 

15462
08:17:25,381 --> 08:17:26,483
DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY RESPOND OR 

15463
08:17:26,483 --> 08:17:27,550
GIVES AN ANSWER LIKE SAYING, 

15464
08:17:27,550 --> 08:17:28,851
I'M HERE NOW, IT'S A REALTIME 

15465
08:17:28,851 --> 08:17:33,656
DEMONSTRATION OF EQUIVOCATION. 

15466
08:17:33,656 --> 08:17:37,427
THAT COULD BE A CHALLENGE FOR 

15467
08:17:37,427 --> 08:17:37,627
HIM. 

15468
08:17:37,627 --> 08:17:39,595
>> ALL OF THIS RIVETING 

15469
08:17:39,595 --> 08:17:41,430
TESTIMONY COMES AFTER THE 

15470
08:17:41,430 --> 08:17:44,234
MORNING SESSION, IN WHICH 

15471
08:17:44,234 --> 08:17:46,102
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD DID NOT 

15472
08:17:46,102 --> 08:17:47,904
APPEAR EVASIVE, APPEARED VERY 

15473
08:17:47,904 --> 08:17:48,104
OPEN. 

15474
08:17:48,104 --> 08:17:49,005
THE TOWN BETWEEN THE TWO 

15475
08:17:49,005 --> 08:17:49,572
HEARINGS, MORNING AND 

15476
08:17:49,572 --> 08:17:50,139
AFTERNOON, CERTAINLY VERY 

15477
08:17:50,139 --> 08:17:51,174
DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE 

15478
08:17:51,174 --> 08:17:52,375
ARE HEARING FROM BOTH THE 

15479
08:17:52,375 --> 08:17:58,548
PRINCIPLES INVOLVED. 

15480
08:17:58,548 --> 08:17:59,449
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT 

15481
08:17:59,449 --> 08:18:00,950
FOR THE SENATORS TO GO THROUGH. 

15482
08:18:00,950 --> 08:18:09,592
>> THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THEIR 

15483
08:18:09,592 --> 08:18:10,327
GAME PLAN ON. 

15484
08:18:10,327 --> 08:18:10,993
THEY ARE COHESIVE THIS 

15485
08:18:10,993 --> 08:18:11,294
úAFTERNO 

15486
08:18:11,294 --> 08:18:12,495
I THINK YOU COULD SAY THEY WERE 

15487
08:18:12,495 --> 08:18:13,730
COHESIVE THIS MORNING AND THEY 

15488
08:18:13,730 --> 08:18:21,137
MADE A DECISION NOT TO THE 

15489
08:18:21,137 --> 08:18:22,539
QUESTIONING, BUT TO USE THE 

15490
08:18:22,539 --> 08:18:25,208
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR DO THE 

15491
08:18:25,208 --> 08:18:27,010
QUESTIONING FOR WHAT GOOD OR 

15492
08:18:27,010 --> 08:18:27,644
BAD ACTED THEM. 

15493
08:18:27,644 --> 08:18:29,646
THEY TREATED DR. FORD WITH 

15494
08:18:29,646 --> 08:18:32,248
RESPECT AND IT'S OF THE IDEA 

15495
08:18:32,248 --> 08:18:33,984
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DR. 

15496
08:18:33,984 --> 08:18:35,285
FORD AND IT JUST WASN'T BRETT 

15497
08:18:35,285 --> 08:18:35,585
KAVANAUGH. 

15498
08:18:35,585 --> 08:18:36,653
THERE IS A FEELING OF SYMPATHY 

15499
08:18:36,653 --> 08:18:37,487
AND EMPATHY. 

15500
08:18:37,487 --> 08:18:39,055
THEY PLAYED THE ROLE OF BEING 

15501
08:18:39,055 --> 08:18:50,767
THE GOOD GUYS. 

15502
08:18:50,767 --> 08:18:51,634
EVEN WITH A POLITICAL MESSAGE 

15503
08:18:51,634 --> 08:19:03,780
TO GIVE, IT IS HIGHLY COHESIVE. 

15504
08:19:03,780 --> 08:19:04,948
THEY'RE COMING TO A POINT TO 

15505
08:19:04,948 --> 08:19:06,082
GET WHAT THEY WANT, AND WHAT 

15506
08:19:06,082 --> 08:19:06,983
THEY WANT ARE THESE FEW VOTES 

15507
08:19:06,983 --> 08:19:08,284
THAT MAY BE UP IN THE AIR. 

15508
08:19:08,284 --> 08:19:09,552
YOU KNOW, THE GAUNTLET -- IT'S 

15509
08:19:09,552 --> 08:19:09,885
BEEN DROPPED. 

15510
08:19:09,885 --> 08:19:12,221
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT UP OR ELSE 

15511
08:19:12,221 --> 08:19:12,956
LOOK WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 

15512
08:19:12,956 --> 08:19:14,357
THE ONLY THING I SEE AS A WORRY 

15513
08:19:14,357 --> 08:19:18,595
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, AS HE TAKES

15514
08:19:18,595 --> 08:19:20,130
THIS BREAK AND HAS A GLASS OF 

15515
08:19:20,130 --> 08:19:22,565
WATER OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT 

15516
08:19:22,565 --> 08:19:28,304
CENTERS HIM, OR GIVES A HUG TO 

15517
08:19:28,304 --> 08:19:30,807
HIS WIFE, TO FEEL SUPPORT, HE 

15518
08:19:30,807 --> 08:19:32,675
MUST BE CAREFUL OF NOT LOSING 

15519
08:19:32,675 --> 08:19:33,409
HIS TEMPER. 

15520
08:19:33,409 --> 08:19:34,878
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT HE 

15521
08:19:34,878 --> 08:19:36,079
REALLY HAS TO WATCH. 

15522
08:19:36,079 --> 08:19:37,547
>> DO YOU THINK THERE ARE 

15523
08:19:37,547 --> 08:19:39,315
PEOPLE TELLING HIM THAT RIGHT 

15524
08:19:39,315 --> 08:19:39,682
NOW? 

15525
08:19:39,682 --> 08:19:42,285
>> I THINK SOMEONE HAS TOLD HIM 

15526
08:19:42,285 --> 08:19:43,820
THAT ALREADY OR HE KNOWS IT. 

15527
08:19:43,820 --> 08:19:46,389
THE DEMOCRATS, AS THEY GO DOWN 

15528
08:19:46,389 --> 08:19:48,825
THE LINE, THEY WILL TRY TO BAIT 

15529
08:19:48,825 --> 08:19:50,026
HIM. 

15530
08:19:50,026 --> 08:19:52,962
ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN THIS 

15531
08:19:52,962 --> 08:19:54,164
EXAMINATION, BESIDES IF YOU 

15532
08:19:54,164 --> 08:19:55,331
WANT THE FBI INVESTIGATION, IS 

15533
08:19:55,331 --> 08:19:57,400
THE IDEA OF HIS BEING A 

15534
08:19:57,400 --> 08:19:58,067
BELLIGERENT DRUNK AND ACTING 

15535
08:19:58,067 --> 08:20:02,539
OUT IN A WAY THAT WAS OUT OF 

15536
08:20:02,539 --> 08:20:02,839
CHARACTER. 

15537
08:20:02,839 --> 08:20:04,741
SO, THAT PERSON, THE 

15538
08:20:04,741 --> 08:20:05,908
BELLIGERENT DRUNK, THE ABUSIVE 

15539
08:20:05,908 --> 08:20:07,777
DRUNK, THE DRUNK WHO MIGHT NOT 

15540
08:20:07,777 --> 08:20:09,312
REMEMBER WHAT HE DID AND DO 

15541
08:20:09,312 --> 08:20:10,680
SOMETHING ON TOWARD, THAT 

15542
08:20:10,680 --> 08:20:13,149
PERSON WOULD NOT BE FIT TO BE 

15543
08:20:13,149 --> 08:20:14,184
ON THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. 

15544
08:20:14,184 --> 08:20:15,218
>> ALSO ABOUT BEING TRUTHFUL. 

15545
08:20:15,218 --> 08:20:17,720
I KNOW IT'S SMALL AND I CAN 

15546
08:20:17,720 --> 08:20:19,155
ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD BE 

15547
08:20:19,155 --> 08:20:20,857
GOING THROUGH IF WE RELIVED 

15548
08:20:20,857 --> 08:20:22,125
WHAT WE DID AND PUT IN OUR 

15549
08:20:22,125 --> 08:20:22,926
YEARBOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND 

15550
08:20:22,926 --> 08:20:25,795
WHAT HAVE YOU, BUT, THIS IS ONE 

15551
08:20:25,795 --> 08:20:26,963
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN 

15552
08:20:26,963 --> 08:20:32,001
THE COUNTRY, IF NOT THE WORLD. 

15553
08:20:32,001 --> 08:20:33,102
SO MUCH OF IT DEPENDS ON 

15554
08:20:33,102 --> 08:20:33,870
HONESTY AND TRUTHFULNESS. 

15555
08:20:33,870 --> 08:20:35,004
THE PARTS ABOUT THE YEARBOOK, 

15556
08:20:35,004 --> 08:20:40,543
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT RENATE. 

15557
08:20:40,543 --> 08:20:43,012
AS SMALL AS IT MAY BE, BOYS 

15558
08:20:43,012 --> 08:20:43,847
TREATED GIRLS BADLY IN HIGH 

15559
08:20:43,847 --> 08:20:44,714
SCHOOL, AND FOR HIM TO 

15560
08:20:44,714 --> 08:20:45,782
DEFINITIVELY SAY THAT SHE WAS 

15561
08:20:45,782 --> 08:20:52,455
ONE OF US AND THIS WAS HER 

15562
08:20:52,455 --> 08:20:54,657
BEING BUDDIES WITH THE BOYS AND 

15563
08:20:54,657 --> 08:20:56,826
WE HAD HIGH RESPECT. 

15564
08:20:56,826 --> 08:20:58,561
HEARING HER SIDE OF THE STORY, 

15565
08:20:58,561 --> 08:21:00,563
I FIND IT PERSONALLY SO HARD TO 

15566
08:21:00,563 --> 08:21:02,499
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS WHAT THAT 

15567
08:21:02,499 --> 08:21:02,932
MEANT. I 

15568
08:21:02,932 --> 08:21:04,834
KNOW IT'S SMALL BUT IN THE 

15569
08:21:04,834 --> 08:21:06,336
LARGER SCHEME OF THINGS WHEN 

15570
08:21:06,336 --> 08:21:08,304
YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEONE'S 

15571
08:21:08,304 --> 08:21:10,006
CHARACTER, FOR HIM TO STAND BY 

15572
08:21:10,006 --> 08:21:11,741
THE STATEMENT THAT SHE WAS ONE 

15573
08:21:11,741 --> 08:21:13,109
OF US -- I DON'T KNOW -- THAT 

15574
08:21:13,109 --> 08:21:16,912
DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME. 

15575
08:21:16,912 --> 08:21:20,617
>> HE TOOK ISSUE WITH THE FOLKS 

15576
08:21:20,617 --> 08:21:21,851
THAT ORGANIZE THE YEARBOOK. 

15577
08:21:21,851 --> 08:21:23,086
>> YOU HAVE TO THINK BACK, THIS 

15578
08:21:23,086 --> 08:21:23,520
WAS 1982. 

15579
08:21:23,520 --> 08:21:26,890
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. 

15580
08:21:26,890 --> 08:21:34,764
>> I MEAN, THAT WAS PART OF 

15581
08:21:34,764 --> 08:21:36,833
THIS, PROBABLY MAYBE EVEN 

15582
08:21:36,833 --> 08:21:37,066
WORSE. 

15583
08:21:37,066 --> 08:21:40,103
THOSE WERE THE MOVIES, ANIMAL 

15584
08:21:40,103 --> 08:21:40,336
HOUSE. 

15585
08:21:40,336 --> 08:21:42,038
THEY WOULDN'T MAKE THOSE MOVIES 

15586
08:21:42,038 --> 08:21:42,271
TODAY. 

15587
08:21:42,271 --> 08:21:43,873
>> THE DEMOCRATIC EFFORT IS THAT

15588
08:21:43,873 --> 08:21:44,974
PRESUMABLY THEY ARE INQUIRING 

15589
08:21:44,974 --> 08:21:46,109
IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THEY WANT 

15590
08:21:46,109 --> 08:21:48,978
TO KNOW IF THE KAVANAUGH 

15591
08:21:48,978 --> 08:21:51,214
DESCRIBED BY HIS FRIEND IN THE 

15592
08:21:51,214 --> 08:21:53,016
BOOK ABOUT EXCESSIVE DRINKING

15593
08:21:53,016 --> 08:21:54,951
AND THE KAVANAUGH DESCRIBED BY 

15594
08:21:54,951 --> 08:21:58,421
DR. FORD, IF THAT PERSON IS 

15595
08:21:58,421 --> 08:21:59,956
EVEN ONE THAT IS POSSIBLE TO 

15596
08:21:59,956 --> 08:22:01,257
APPROACH BY EVIDENCE THEY CAN 

15597
08:22:01,257 --> 08:22:03,226
GATHER FROM INQUIRING FROM HIM. 

15598
08:22:03,226 --> 08:22:05,461
BUT, THAT FRAMING HAS BEEN LOST 

15599
08:22:05,461 --> 08:22:06,729
A LITTLE AND THERE'S JUST 

15600
08:22:06,729 --> 08:22:08,231
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE YEARBOOK. 

15601
08:22:08,231 --> 08:22:09,165
ANYBODY WHO HASN'T BEEN 

15602
08:22:09,165 --> 08:22:10,433
FOLLOWING THIS QUITE CLOSELY 

15603
08:22:10,433 --> 08:22:11,601
WITH THING, WHY ARE THEY ASKING 

15604
08:22:11,601 --> 08:22:12,068
ABOUT THE YEARBOOK? 

15605
08:22:12,068 --> 08:22:13,937
WHY IS THAT RELEVANT? 

15606
08:22:13,937 --> 08:22:16,439
THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR 

15607
08:22:16,439 --> 08:22:16,739
DEMOCRATS. 

15608
08:22:16,739 --> 08:22:18,675
>> OUTSIDE OF THE YEARBOOK AND 

15609
08:22:18,675 --> 08:22:22,846
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE 

15610
08:22:22,846 --> 08:22:24,080
ALLEGATIONS, SO MUCH OF THIS 

15611
08:22:24,080 --> 08:22:25,114
HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE 

15612
08:22:25,114 --> 08:22:26,316
TIMELINE. 

15613
08:22:26,316 --> 08:22:29,018
THAT IS REPUBLICANS TALKING 

15614
08:22:29,018 --> 08:22:35,824
THIS MORNING ABOUT, WHY DIDN'T 

15615
08:22:35,824 --> 08:22:37,660
YOU TELL US THIS EARLIER AND 

15616
08:22:37,660 --> 08:22:38,628
DEMOCRATS SAYING, WHY CAN WE 

15617
08:22:38,628 --> 08:22:39,729
TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME AND 

15618
08:22:39,729 --> 08:22:45,735
HAVE THIS FBI INVESTIGATION? 

15619
08:22:45,735 --> 08:22:48,204
SO MUCH OF IT HAS RETURNED 

15620
08:22:48,204 --> 08:22:50,172
TODAY, TO THAT TIMING ISSUE. 

15621
08:22:50,172 --> 08:22:51,540
>> OF COURSE. 

15622
08:22:51,540 --> 08:22:53,576
THAT WAS EXACTLY WHERE RACHEL 

15623
08:22:53,576 --> 08:22:54,944
MITCHELL WAS GOING THIS 

15624
08:22:54,944 --> 08:22:56,045
MORNING. 

15625
08:22:56,045 --> 08:22:58,548
SHE SPENT, I WOULD SAY, AT 

15626
08:22:58,548 --> 08:23:00,716
LEAST HALF OF HER FIVE MINUTE 

15627
08:23:00,716 --> 08:23:03,219
INTERVIEWS DEALING WITH THE 

15628
08:23:03,219 --> 08:23:05,154
TIMELINE AND THAT IS A 

15629
08:23:05,154 --> 08:23:05,855
POLITICAL INQUIRY, NOT A 

15630
08:23:05,855 --> 08:23:06,455
FACTUAL CREDIBILITY INQUIRY. 

15631
08:23:06,455 --> 08:23:08,725
THAT LED TO THE FOUNDATION FOR 

15632
08:23:08,725 --> 08:23:09,959
EXACTLY WHERE LINDSEY GRAHAM 

15633
08:23:09,959 --> 08:23:15,031
WAS GOING TO GO. 

15634
08:23:15,031 --> 08:23:17,367
SO, I THINK THAT THEY'VE 

15635
08:23:17,367 --> 08:23:20,036
THOUGHT THIS OUT ON THE 

15636
08:23:20,036 --> 08:23:20,770
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 

15637
08:23:20,770 --> 08:23:23,640
IN A WAY, PERHAPS, THAT THE 

15638
08:23:23,640 --> 08:23:25,208
DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT, WHICH 

15639
08:23:25,208 --> 08:23:25,541
SURPRISES ME. 

15640
08:23:25,541 --> 08:23:28,177
>> I ALSO THINK REPUBLICANS 

15641
08:23:28,177 --> 08:23:28,610
GENUINELY BELIEVE. 

15642
08:23:28,610 --> 08:23:30,413
THEY KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS. 

15643
08:23:30,413 --> 08:23:32,415
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WANT THE FBI 

15644
08:23:32,415 --> 08:23:32,782
INVESTIGATION. 

15645
08:23:32,782 --> 08:23:33,783
HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE? 

15646
08:23:33,783 --> 08:23:36,052
YOU GET THAT NOW, WE NEED 

15647
08:23:36,052 --> 08:23:38,154
ANOTHER HEARING ON THAT WILL 

15648
08:23:38,154 --> 08:23:39,055
TAKE ANOTHER TWO WEEKS TO 

15649
08:23:39,055 --> 08:23:40,023
SCHEDULE THE HEARING BECAUSE 

15650
08:23:40,023 --> 08:23:41,090
SHE'S GOT TO COME BACK AND THEY 

15651
08:23:41,090 --> 08:23:42,392
HAVE TO GET WITNESSES. 

15652
08:23:42,392 --> 08:23:45,662
ONE OF THEM IS VERY ILL AND WE 

15653
08:23:45,662 --> 08:23:46,396
MAY NOT GET HER BACK. 

15654
08:23:46,396 --> 08:23:47,263
THAT'S ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR 

15655
08:23:47,263 --> 08:23:47,496
WEEKS. 

15656
08:23:47,496 --> 08:23:51,034
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO 

15657
08:23:51,034 --> 08:23:52,802
THE MIDTERMS. 

15658
08:23:52,802 --> 08:23:54,037
THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN 

15659
08:23:54,037 --> 08:23:55,038
EFFORT TO PUSH THIS PAST THE 

15660
08:23:55,038 --> 08:23:58,708
MIDTERMS, DEFEAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

15661
08:23:58,708 --> 08:24:00,877
AND THEN NO OTHER NOMINEE WILL 

15662
08:24:00,877 --> 08:24:02,578
EVER BE CONFIRMED IF DEMOCRATS 

15663
08:24:02,578 --> 08:24:04,280
TAKE THE SENATE. 

15664
08:24:04,280 --> 08:24:05,214
THEY WILL KEEP THAT SEAT OPEN. 

15665
08:24:05,214 --> 08:24:06,215
IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS PAYBACK 

15666
08:24:06,215 --> 08:24:09,218
FOR MERRICK GARLAND. 

15667
08:24:09,218 --> 08:24:10,053
SO, REPUBLICANS REALLY SEE THAT 

15668
08:24:10,053 --> 08:24:10,720
AS THE GAME PLAN. 

15669
08:24:10,720 --> 08:24:17,493
THAT IS WHY THEY THINK THE FBI 

15670
08:24:17,493 --> 08:24:18,828
INVESTIGATION IS A PURE SMOKE 

15671
08:24:18,828 --> 08:24:19,061
SCREEN. 

15672
08:24:19,061 --> 08:24:21,030
>> THAT IS HOW KAVANAUGH SEES 

15673
08:24:21,030 --> 08:24:22,298
IT, UNDOUBTEDLY. 

15674
08:24:22,298 --> 08:24:24,734
THAT IS WHY HE IS NOT SAYING 

15675
08:24:24,734 --> 08:24:25,702
SURE, HAVE THE FBI, BECAUSE 

15676
08:24:25,702 --> 08:24:26,536
THERE IS A LOT -- 

15677
08:24:26,536 --> 08:24:27,470
>> WHEN REPUBLICANS SAY DELAY, 

15678
08:24:27,470 --> 08:24:35,979
THERE IS -- IT'S FACTUAL AND 

15679
08:24:35,979 --> 08:24:36,879
THERE IS TRUTH IN IT. 

15680
08:24:36,879 --> 08:24:38,547
>> IS ALSO FIGHTING FOR HIS 

15681
08:24:38,547 --> 08:24:38,848
CHARACTER. 

15682
08:24:38,848 --> 08:24:40,717
FORGIVE ME IF I'M WRONG BECAUSE 

15683
08:24:40,717 --> 08:24:41,283
I MAY WELL BE. 

15684
08:24:41,283 --> 08:24:42,184
TO DR. FORD INITIALY ASKED TO 

15685
08:24:42,184 --> 08:24:44,120
SPEAK AFTER HIM? 

15686
08:24:44,120 --> 08:24:45,254
>> IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC 

15687
08:24:45,254 --> 08:24:51,361
OPINION, AS WERE -- AS YOU ARE 

15688
08:24:51,361 --> 08:24:52,862
SAYING, IF SOMEONE JUST TURNED 

15689
08:24:52,862 --> 08:24:54,597
THIS ON AND WATCHED JUDGE 

15690
08:24:54,597 --> 08:24:56,065
KAVANAUGH, THERE IS A LOT TO 

15691
08:24:56,065 --> 08:24:57,667
TAKE AWAY FROM HIM, FROM HIS 

15692
08:24:57,667 --> 08:24:59,402
EMOTION AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE 

15693
08:24:59,402 --> 08:25:00,503
PAIN THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY HAD 

15694
08:25:00,503 --> 08:25:03,005
GONE THROUGH, FROM HIS 

15695
08:25:03,005 --> 08:25:05,842
STEADFASTNESS AND SAYING I WAS 

15696
08:25:05,842 --> 08:25:07,610
NOT THERE AND THIS DID NOT 

15697
08:25:07,610 --> 08:25:07,843
HAPPEN. 

15698
08:25:07,843 --> 08:25:09,312
COMPARE THAT TO EVERYONE'S 

15699
08:25:09,312 --> 08:25:10,546
REACTION AFTER WATCHING DR. 

15700
08:25:10,546 --> 08:25:10,980
FORD. 

15701
08:25:10,980 --> 08:25:13,716
IF YOU HAD ONLY SEEN ONE, YOU 

15702
08:25:13,716 --> 08:25:15,651
WOULD SAY BOTH ARE EQUALLY 

15703
08:25:15,651 --> 08:25:16,118
COMPELLING, RIGHT? 

15704
08:25:16,118 --> 08:25:18,454
>> IN AMERICA, IF YOU ARE 

15705
08:25:18,454 --> 08:25:19,555
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, OR SYSTEM 

15706
08:25:19,555 --> 08:25:21,424
OF JUSTICE -- AND I KNOW IT'S 

15707
08:25:21,424 --> 08:25:24,827
NOT A COURT ROOM -- BUT IF YOU 

15708
08:25:24,827 --> 08:25:27,029
ARE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, YOU 

15709
08:25:27,029 --> 08:25:28,197
ARE ENTITLED TO HEAR THE 

15710
08:25:28,197 --> 08:25:30,800
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST YOU BEFORE 

15711
08:25:30,800 --> 08:25:31,133
YOU RESPOND. 

15712
08:25:31,133 --> 08:25:32,335
THE SUGGESTION THAT HE WOULD GO 

15713
08:25:32,335 --> 08:25:33,770
FIRST, THE INITIAL SUGGESTION, 

15714
08:25:33,770 --> 08:25:36,038
WHICH FUELS DISTRESS BY 

15715
08:25:36,038 --> 08:25:38,341
REPUBLICANS, BY THE WAY, BUT 

15716
08:25:38,341 --> 08:25:39,475
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT'S ALL 

15717
08:25:39,475 --> 08:25:40,042
DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES, THE 

15718
08:25:40,042 --> 08:25:41,077
SUGGESTION WAS AND WHAT THEY 

15719
08:25:41,077 --> 08:25:43,012
WOULD ARGUE FOR -- WHAT THEY 

15720
08:25:43,012 --> 08:25:45,181
ARGUE WITH IS THAT HE WOULD 

15721
08:25:45,181 --> 08:25:46,149
TESTIFY AND THEN SHE WOULD 

15722
08:25:46,149 --> 08:25:46,949
TESTIFY AND HE WOULD HAVE NO 

15723
08:25:46,949 --> 08:25:51,119
CHANCE FOR REBUTTAL. 

15724
08:25:51,119 --> 08:25:52,822
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FAIR 

15725
08:25:52,822 --> 08:25:54,824
PROCESS, I MEAN -- IF YOU ARE 

15726
08:25:54,824 --> 08:25:55,925
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, YOU HAVE 

15727
08:25:55,925 --> 08:25:59,662
TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT THE 

15728
08:25:59,662 --> 08:26:00,530
ALLEGATIONS ARE AGAINST YOU AND 

15729
08:26:00,530 --> 08:26:00,830
TO RESPOND. 

15730
08:26:00,830 --> 08:26:01,264
THIS IS AMERICA. 

15731
08:26:01,264 --> 08:26:02,932
>> REPUBLICANS MUST BE FEELING 

15732
08:26:02,932 --> 08:26:05,601
BETTER NOW. 

15733
08:26:05,601 --> 08:26:06,602
>> A LOT BETTER. 

15734
08:26:06,602 --> 08:26:08,771
>> AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY BACK 

15735
08:26:08,771 --> 08:26:11,007
TO THE HEARING ROOM, WE BELIEVE 

15736
08:26:11,007 --> 08:26:12,875
THIS BREAK IS ENDING VERY SOON, 

15737
08:26:12,875 --> 08:26:14,143
I WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE TO 

15738
08:26:14,143 --> 08:26:15,077
LISTEN TO BOTH OF THE 

15739
08:26:15,077 --> 08:26:15,377
PRINCIPLES. 

15740
08:26:15,377 --> 08:26:19,749
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SOUND 

15741
08:26:19,749 --> 08:26:20,483
FROM THE MOST RECENT TESTIMONY 

15742
08:26:20,483 --> 08:26:26,556
AND THAT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

15743
08:26:26,556 --> 08:26:27,523
>> THE OTHER NIGHT, ASHLEY AND 

15744
08:26:27,523 --> 08:26:28,724
MY DAUGHTER ELIZA SAID PRAYERS. 

15745
08:26:28,724 --> 08:26:38,601
ELIZA, 10 YEARS OLD -- SAID TO 

15746
08:26:38,601 --> 08:26:39,768
ASHLEY, WE SHOULD PRAY FOR THE 

15747
08:26:39,768 --> 08:26:42,905
WOMAN. 

15748
08:26:42,905 --> 08:26:46,576
THAT'S A LOT OF WISDOM FROM A 

15749
08:26:46,576 --> 08:26:48,644
10-YEAR-OLD. 

15750
08:26:48,644 --> 08:26:57,086
WE MEAN NO ILL WILL. 

15751
08:26:57,086 --> 08:27:01,624
>> NOW, IF WE CAN, SOME OF THE 

15752
08:27:01,624 --> 08:27:02,625
MOST EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY WE 

15753
08:27:02,625 --> 08:27:04,459
HEARD FROM THE MORNING. 

15754
08:27:04,459 --> 08:27:05,528
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 

15755
08:27:05,528 --> 08:27:06,429
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS ASKED 

15756
08:27:06,429 --> 08:27:08,297
THIS MORNING, WAS WHAT WAS MOST 

15757
08:27:08,297 --> 08:27:10,600
MEMORABLE ABOUT THAT NIGHT IN 

15758
08:27:10,600 --> 08:27:13,636
1982, FOR HER. 

15759
08:27:13,636 --> 08:27:22,778
>> WE DON'T HAVE IT. 

15760
08:27:22,778 --> 08:27:24,280
WE WILL TRY TO GET THAT BECAUSE 

15761
08:27:24,280 --> 08:27:24,947
I THINK, TO YOUR POINT, IT'S 

15762
08:27:24,947 --> 08:27:32,755
IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T 

15763
08:27:32,755 --> 08:27:34,557
SEEN THE ENTIRETY, AS WE HAVE, 

15764
08:27:34,557 --> 08:27:35,391
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE AND 

15765
08:27:35,391 --> 08:27:40,763
MORE HELPFUL FOR SENATORS TO 

15766
08:27:40,763 --> 08:27:41,163
HEAR EVERYTHING. 

15767
08:27:41,163 --> 08:27:42,932
BRETT KAVANAUGH SITTING BACK 

15768
08:27:42,932 --> 08:27:54,944
DOWN NOW. 

15769
08:28:34,383 --> 08:28:35,217
>> JUDGE, ARE YOU READY? 

15770
08:28:35,217 --> 08:28:35,918
>> I AM READY. 

15771
08:28:35,918 --> 08:28:38,921
CAN I SAY ONE THING? 

15772
08:28:38,921 --> 08:28:40,590
>> YES. 

15773
08:28:40,590 --> 08:28:41,823
>> I STARTED MY LAST COLLOQUY 

15774
08:28:41,823 --> 08:28:43,025
BY SAYING TO SENATOR KLOBUCHAR 

15775
08:28:43,025 --> 08:28:44,193
HOW MUCH I RESPECTED HER AND 

15776
08:28:44,193 --> 08:28:45,227
WHAT SHE DID AT THE LAST 

15777
08:28:45,227 --> 08:28:47,597
HEARING AND SHE ASKED ME A 

15778
08:28:47,597 --> 08:28:48,664
QUESTION AT THE END THAT I 

15779
08:28:48,664 --> 08:28:49,798
RESPONDED BY ASKING HER A 

15780
08:28:49,798 --> 08:28:50,065
QUESTION. 

15781
08:28:50,065 --> 08:28:51,867
I'M SORRY I DID THAT. 

15782
08:28:51,867 --> 08:28:52,901
THIS IS A TOUGH PROCESS AND I'M 

15783
08:28:52,901 --> 08:28:54,270
SORRY ABOUT THAT. 

15784
08:28:54,270 --> 08:28:55,671
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. I 

15785
08:28:55,671 --> 08:28:58,274
WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WHEN YOU 

15786
08:28:58,274 --> 08:28:59,275
HAVE A PARENT THAT IS 

15787
08:28:59,275 --> 08:29:00,076
ALCOHOLIC, YOU ARE PRETTY 

15788
08:29:00,076 --> 08:29:02,011
CAREFUL ABOUT DRINKING AND THE 

15789
08:29:02,011 --> 08:29:03,446
SECOND THING, I WAS TRULY JUST 

15790
08:29:03,446 --> 08:29:05,714
TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF 

15791
08:29:05,714 --> 08:29:07,483
THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE. 

15792
08:29:07,483 --> 08:29:09,418
AGAIN, I BELIEVE WE DO THAT BY 

15793
08:29:09,418 --> 08:29:10,553
OPENING UP THE FBI 

15794
08:29:10,553 --> 08:29:12,321
INVESTIGATION AND I WOULD CALL 

15795
08:29:12,321 --> 08:29:15,291
IT A BACKGROUND CHECK INSTEAD OF

15796
08:29:15,291 --> 08:29:15,658
INVESTIGATION. 

15797
08:29:15,658 --> 08:29:16,025
THANK YOU. 

15798
08:29:16,025 --> 08:29:16,826
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

15799
08:29:16,826 --> 08:29:18,060
>> SENATOR HATCH? 

15800
08:29:18,060 --> 08:29:18,761
>> THANK YOU, JUDGE. 

15801
08:29:18,761 --> 08:29:19,028
WELCOME. 

15802
08:29:19,028 --> 08:29:22,598
WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. 

15803
08:29:22,598 --> 08:29:24,533
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW 

15804
08:29:24,533 --> 08:29:25,034
WORDS. 

15805
08:29:25,034 --> 08:29:27,036
MY FRIEND FROM ARIZONA 

15806
08:29:27,036 --> 08:29:27,803
EMPHASIZED YESTERDAY THAT WE 

15807
08:29:27,803 --> 08:29:28,771
HAVE, BEFORE US TODAY, TWO 

15808
08:29:28,771 --> 08:29:29,104
HUMAN BEINGS. 

15809
08:29:29,104 --> 08:29:32,341
DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

15810
08:29:32,341 --> 08:29:33,075
THEY DESERVE, EACH OF YOU 

15811
08:29:33,075 --> 08:29:38,614
DESERVE TO BE TREATED FAIRLY 

15812
08:29:38,614 --> 08:29:39,248
AND RESPECTFULLY. 

15813
08:29:39,248 --> 08:29:41,584
WE TRIED TO DO THAT WITH THE 

15814
08:29:41,584 --> 08:29:42,585
DOCTOR FORD EARLIER AND I THINK 

15815
08:29:42,585 --> 08:29:43,085
WE SUCCEEDED. 

15816
08:29:43,085 --> 08:29:43,786
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TREAT 

15817
08:29:43,786 --> 08:29:47,256
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FAIRLY, NOW. 

15818
08:29:47,256 --> 08:29:48,524
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW 

15819
08:29:48,524 --> 08:29:49,257
THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT. 

15820
08:29:49,257 --> 08:29:50,593
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN A 

15821
08:29:50,593 --> 08:29:56,399
FEDERAL JUDGE FOR 12 YEARS AND 

15822
08:29:56,399 --> 08:29:58,401
HAS BEEN A GREAT FEDERAL JUDGE 

15823
08:29:58,401 --> 08:30:00,236
ON THE SECOND HIGHEST COURT IN 

15824
08:30:00,236 --> 08:30:00,670
THE NATION. 

15825
08:30:00,670 --> 08:30:01,337
HE'S EARNED A REPUTATION FOR 

15826
08:30:01,337 --> 08:30:01,903
FAIRNESS AND DECENCY. 

15827
08:30:01,903 --> 08:30:07,343
HIS CLERKS LOVE HIM. 

15828
08:30:07,343 --> 08:30:09,945
HIS STUDENTS -- HE TEACHES IN 

15829
08:30:09,945 --> 08:30:10,546
LAW SCHOOL. 

15830
08:30:10,546 --> 08:30:11,847
HIS STUDENTS LOVE HIM. 

15831
08:30:11,847 --> 08:30:12,782
HIS COLLEAGUES LOVE HIM. 

15832
08:30:12,782 --> 08:30:13,883
THIS MAN IS NOT A MONSTER, NOR 

15833
08:30:13,883 --> 08:30:15,451
IS HE WHAT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED 

15834
08:30:15,451 --> 08:30:20,155
HERE IN THESE HEARINGS. 

15835
08:30:20,155 --> 08:30:21,123
WE ARE TALKING TODAY ABOUT 

15836
08:30:21,123 --> 08:30:21,723
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CONDUCT IN 

15837
08:30:21,723 --> 08:30:22,424
HIGH SCHOOL. 

15838
08:30:22,424 --> 08:30:31,567
EVEN THEN, AS A FRESHMAN IN 

15839
08:30:31,567 --> 08:30:32,635
COLLEGE, I GUESS, AS WELL. 

15840
08:30:32,635 --> 08:30:33,269
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN 

15841
08:30:33,269 --> 08:30:34,370
RAISED IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

15842
08:30:34,370 --> 08:30:37,339
COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT, HE 

15843
08:30:37,339 --> 08:30:40,409
SHOULD NOT SERVE ON THE SUPREME 

15844
08:30:40,409 --> 08:30:40,642
COURT. 

15845
08:30:40,642 --> 08:30:42,678
I THINK WE SHOULD WOULD ALL 

15846
08:30:42,678 --> 08:30:43,512
AGREE WITH THAT. 

15847
08:30:43,512 --> 08:30:44,346
THE CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE CREATED 

15848
08:30:44,346 --> 08:30:45,715
SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES 

15849
08:30:45,715 --> 08:30:46,549
FOR SLEEP THE ALLEGATIONS TO 

15850
08:30:46,549 --> 08:30:47,817
THE MEDIA TWO WEEKS AGO, AFTER 

15851
08:30:47,817 --> 08:30:53,756
SITTING ON THEM FOR SIX WEEKS, 

15852
08:30:53,756 --> 08:30:56,425
I MIGHT ADD, IT'S BROUGHT US 

15853
08:30:56,425 --> 08:30:57,759
THE WORST IN OUR POLITICS. 

15854
08:30:57,759 --> 08:30:59,528
IT CERTAINLY HAS BROUGHT US NO 

15855
08:30:59,528 --> 08:31:00,762
CLOSER TO THE TRUTH. 

15856
08:31:00,762 --> 08:31:02,998
ANONYMOUS LETTERS WITH NO NAME 

15857
08:31:02,998 --> 08:31:05,167
AND NO RETURN ADDRESS ARE NOT 

15858
08:31:05,167 --> 08:31:06,202
BEING TREATED AS NATIONAL -- 

15859
08:31:06,202 --> 08:31:06,969
ARE NOW BEING TREATED AS 

15860
08:31:06,969 --> 08:31:07,336
NATIONAL NEWS. 

15861
08:31:07,336 --> 08:31:11,707
PORN STAR LAWYERS WITH 

15862
08:31:11,707 --> 08:31:13,209
IMPLAUSIBLE CLIENTS ARE DRIVING 

15863
08:31:13,209 --> 08:31:14,075
THE NEWS CYCLE. I 

15864
08:31:14,075 --> 08:31:16,011
HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THIS IS 

15865
08:31:16,011 --> 08:31:18,080
WORSE THAN ROBERT BORK AND I 

15866
08:31:18,080 --> 08:31:19,582
DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET WORSE 

15867
08:31:19,582 --> 08:31:20,116
THAN THAT. 

15868
08:31:20,116 --> 08:31:21,383
IT'S WORSE THAN CLARENCE THOMAS 

15869
08:31:21,383 --> 08:31:22,918
AND I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET 

15870
08:31:22,918 --> 08:31:23,452
ANY WORSE THAN THAT. 

15871
08:31:23,452 --> 08:31:24,720
THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE THE 

15872
08:31:24,720 --> 08:31:28,824
WAY YOU ARE BEING TREATED. 

15873
08:31:28,824 --> 08:31:31,193
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL WE HAVE 

15874
08:31:31,193 --> 08:31:33,162
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, A MAN UNTIL 

15875
08:31:33,162 --> 08:31:34,897
TWO WEEKS AGO, WAS A PILLAR OF 

15876
08:31:34,897 --> 08:31:35,931
THE LEGAL COMMUNITY AND THERE'S 

15877
08:31:35,931 --> 08:31:36,932
BEEN NO WHISPER OF MISCONDUCT 

15878
08:31:36,932 --> 08:31:38,667
BY HIM IN THE TIME HE'S BEEN A 

15879
08:31:38,667 --> 08:31:43,372
JUDGE. 

15880
08:31:43,372 --> 08:31:44,440
BUT WE HAVE ARE UNCORROBORATED, 

15881
08:31:44,440 --> 08:31:46,442
UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS FROM HIS 

15882
08:31:46,442 --> 08:31:48,678
TEENAGE YEARS! 

15883
08:31:48,678 --> 08:31:49,578
CRIMES THAT EVERY A LODGE AND 

15884
08:31:49,578 --> 08:31:54,784
EYE WITNESS HAS EITHER DENIED 

15885
08:31:54,784 --> 08:31:55,617
OR FAILED TO CORROBORATE. 

15886
08:31:55,617 --> 08:31:56,719
I DID NOT MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE 

15887
08:31:56,719 --> 08:32:01,724
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CLAIMS. 

15888
08:32:01,724 --> 08:32:02,858
THEY'VE BEEN SERIOUS CLAIMS BUT 

15889
08:32:02,858 --> 08:32:03,893
THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH HAS TO 

15890
08:32:03,893 --> 08:32:07,029
INVOLVE MORE THAN BARE 

15891
08:32:07,029 --> 08:32:09,532
ASSERTIONS. 

15892
08:32:09,532 --> 08:32:11,467
LIKE DR. FORD, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

15893
08:32:11,467 --> 08:32:12,634
DESERVES FAIR TREATMENT. 

15894
08:32:12,634 --> 08:32:14,169
HE WAS AN IMMATURE 

15895
08:32:14,169 --> 08:32:14,536
HIGHSCHOOLER. 

15896
08:32:14,536 --> 08:32:14,937
SO WERE WE ALL. 

15897
08:32:14,937 --> 08:32:16,038
THAT HE WROTE OR SAID STUPID 

15898
08:32:16,038 --> 08:32:18,908
THINGS DOES NOT MAKE HIM A 

15899
08:32:18,908 --> 08:32:21,811
SEXUAL PREDATOR PREDATOR. 

15900
08:32:21,811 --> 08:32:23,779
I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE OF MY 

15901
08:32:23,779 --> 08:32:24,547
COLLEAGUES TO TEAR DOWN THIS 

15902
08:32:24,547 --> 08:32:26,015
MAN AT ANY COST. 

15903
08:32:26,015 --> 08:32:28,416
I DO UNDERSTAND IT BUT LET'S AT 

15904
08:32:28,416 --> 08:32:31,754
LEAST BE FAIR AND LOOK AT THE 

15905
08:32:31,754 --> 08:32:34,823
FACT OR THE ABSENCE THEREOF. 

15906
08:32:34,823 --> 08:32:36,058
GUILT BY ASSOCIATION IS WRONG. 

15907
08:32:36,058 --> 08:32:37,226
IMMATURITY DOES NOT EQUAL 

15908
08:32:37,226 --> 08:32:37,559
CRIMINALITY. 

15909
08:32:37,559 --> 08:32:39,228
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DRANK IN HIGH 

15910
08:32:39,228 --> 08:32:41,664
SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, BUT THAT 

15911
08:32:41,664 --> 08:32:43,566
DOESN'T MAKE HIM GUILTY OF 

15912
08:32:43,566 --> 08:32:44,700
EVERY TERRIBLE THING THAT HE'S 

15913
08:32:44,700 --> 08:32:45,534
RECENTLY BEEN ACCUSED OF. 

15914
08:32:45,534 --> 08:32:46,569
A LIFETIME OF RESPECT AND EQUAL 

15915
08:32:46,569 --> 08:32:47,102
TREATMENT OUGHT TO MEAN 

15916
08:32:47,102 --> 08:32:52,741
SOMETHING WHEN ASSESSING 

15917
08:32:52,741 --> 08:32:54,477
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE FLATLY 

15918
08:32:54,477 --> 08:32:56,345
INCONSISTENT WITH THE COURSE OF 

15919
08:32:56,345 --> 08:32:57,980
A PERSON'S ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. 

15920
08:32:57,980 --> 08:33:00,049
WITH THOSE COMMENTS, JUDGE, I'D 

15921
08:33:00,049 --> 08:33:02,051
LIKE TO ASK IF YOU QUESTIONS, 

15922
08:33:02,051 --> 08:33:02,618

GET THROUGH A BUNCH OF THEM. 

15926
08:33:07,723 --> 08:33:10,192
IT'S ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS HAS 

15927
08:33:10,192 --> 08:33:10,458

HEARING IS ABOUT DR. FORD'S

SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

15981
08:34:41,483 --> 08:34:43,319
YOU HAVE UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED 

15982
08:34:43,319 --> 08:34:43,652
THOSE CLAIMS. 

15983
08:34:43,652 --> 08:34:47,623
WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ASSESS HER

TIMES, VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED BUT 

15990

OTHER TIMES STRUCK ME AS 

15991
08:34:59,201 --> 08:35:01,270
EVASIVE OR NOT CREDIBLE ON KEY 

15992
08:35:01,270 --> 08:35:01,503

YOU ON THESE TOPICS TODAY BUT I 

16002

DO THINK THEY ARE SERIOUS AND I 

16003
08:35:15,551 --> 08:35:18,020

ATTENTION. 

16005
08:35:18,320 --> 08:35:21,056
SO, LET ME, IF I CAN, RETURN TO 

16006
08:35:21,056 --> 08:35:25,394
A LINE OF QUESTIONING MY 

16007
08:35:25,394 --> 08:35:25,927
COLLEAGUE WAS ON BEFORE. 

16008
08:35:25,927 --> 08:35:26,729
IT WAS ABOUT WHETHER YOU'VE 

16009
08:35:26,729 --> 08:35:28,464
EVER GOTTEN AGGRESSIVE WHILE 

16010
08:35:28,464 --> 08:35:29,365
DRINKING OUR FORGOTTEN AN 

16011
08:35:29,365 --> 08:35:30,032
EVENING AFTER DRINKING. 

16012
08:35:30,032 --> 08:35:30,999
>> THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT 

16013
08:35:30,999 --> 08:35:33,535
QUESTIONS. 

16014
08:35:33,535 --> 08:35:34,603
I'VE ALREADY ANSWERED THE 

16015
08:35:34,603 --> 08:35:34,937
SECOND ONE. 

16016
08:35:34,937 --> 08:35:40,409
AS TO THE FIRST, I THINK THE 

16017
08:35:40,409 --> 08:35:42,544
ANSWER TO THAT IS BASICALLY, 

16018
08:35:42,544 --> 08:35:42,744
NO. I 

16019
08:35:42,744 --> 08:35:44,613
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 

16020
08:35:44,613 --> 08:35:45,114
BY THAT. 

16021
08:35:45,114 --> 08:35:46,748
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 

16022
08:35:46,748 --> 08:35:47,549
>> WELL, THE REASON -- 

16023
08:35:47,549 --> 08:35:50,319
>> I DON'T MEAN IT THAT WAY. 

16024
08:35:50,319 --> 08:35:51,754
BUT, NO IS THE BASIC ANSWER 

16025
08:35:51,754 --> 08:35:52,954
UNLESS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

16026
08:35:52,954 --> 08:35:57,893
SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF 

16027
08:35:57,893 --> 08:35:59,661
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK 

16028
08:35:59,661 --> 08:35:59,895
ABOUT. 

16029
08:35:59,895 --> 08:36:02,197
>> THE REASON I'M ASKING -- 

16030
08:36:02,197 --> 08:36:03,365
WE'VE HAD A BRIEF PERIOD OF 

16031
08:36:03,365 --> 08:36:04,666
TIME TO WAY OUTSIDE EVIDENCE 

16032
08:36:04,666 --> 08:36:07,036
AND I WILL JOIN MY COLLEAGUES 

16033
08:36:07,036 --> 08:36:09,838
IN SAYING THAT I WISH WE HAD 

16034
08:36:09,838 --> 08:36:11,774
MORE EVIDENCE IN FRONT OF US 

16035
08:36:11,774 --> 08:36:12,007
TODAY. 

16036
08:36:12,007 --> 08:36:13,709
DO YOU REMEMBER LIZ SWISHER, A 

16037
08:36:13,709 --> 08:36:18,747
COLLEGE CLASSMATE FROM YALE? 

16038
08:36:18,747 --> 08:36:20,582
>> FIRST YOUR POINT ABOUT 

16039
08:36:20,582 --> 08:36:21,817
OUTSIDE EVIDENCE, ALL FOUR 

16040
08:36:21,817 --> 08:36:22,150
WITNESSES -- 

16041
08:36:22,150 --> 08:36:23,419
>> I'M TRYING TO GET THIS 

16042
08:36:23,419 --> 08:36:23,752
QUESTION -- 

16043
08:36:23,752 --> 08:36:24,987
>> YOU MADE A POINT AND I JUST 

16044
08:36:24,987 --> 08:36:27,056
WANT TO EMPHASIZE. 

16045
08:36:27,056 --> 08:36:32,361
ALL FOUR IT WITNESSES WHO WERE 

16046
08:36:32,361 --> 08:36:34,496
ALLEGEDLY AT THE EVENT HAVE 

16047
08:36:34,496 --> 08:36:35,731
SAID IT DIDN'T HAPPEN INCLUDING 

16048
08:36:35,731 --> 08:36:37,433
DR. FORD'S LONGTIME FRIEND, 

16049
08:36:37,433 --> 08:36:38,033
LELAND KEISER. 

16050
08:36:38,033 --> 08:36:39,668
>> IF MARK JUDGE WERE IN FRONT 

16051
08:36:39,668 --> 08:36:42,871
OF US, WE COULD ASSESS HIS 

16052
08:36:42,871 --> 08:36:43,204
CREDIBILITY. 

16053
08:36:43,204 --> 08:36:45,040
LET ME GET THROUGH THIS, IF I 

16054
08:36:45,040 --> 08:36:45,941
CAN, YOUR HONOR. 

16055
08:36:45,941 --> 08:36:48,610
LIZ SWISHER IS A COLLEGE 

16056
08:36:48,610 --> 08:36:50,445
CLASSMATE AND NOW A MEDICAL 

16057
08:36:50,445 --> 08:36:50,679
DOCTOR. 

16058
08:36:50,679 --> 08:36:51,713
I'M QUOTING FROM A RECENT 

16059
08:36:51,713 --> 08:36:52,146
INTERVIEW SHE GAVE. 

16060
08:36:52,146 --> 08:36:54,750
SHE SAID BRETT KAVANAUGH DRANK 

16061
08:36:54,750 --> 08:36:56,852
MORE THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE. 

16062
08:36:56,852 --> 08:36:58,921
HE DID END UP SLURRING HIS 

16063
08:36:58,921 --> 08:36:59,654
WORDS, AND STUMBLING. 

16064
08:36:59,654 --> 08:37:00,789
IT'S NOT CREDIBLE FOR HIM TO 

16065
08:37:00,789 --> 08:37:03,425
SAY HE'S HAD NO MEMORY LAPSES 

16066
08:37:03,425 --> 08:37:04,726
ON THE NIGHT HE DRANK TO 

16067
08:37:04,726 --> 08:37:05,294
EXCESS. I 

16068
08:37:05,294 --> 08:37:06,995
KNOW BECAUSE I DRINK WITH HIM. 

16069
08:37:06,995 --> 08:37:08,697
HOW SHOULD WE ASSESS THAT? 

16070
08:37:08,697 --> 08:37:11,733
>> SHE THEN GOES ON, IF YOU 

16071
08:37:11,733 --> 08:37:12,734
KEPT READING AND SAYS SHE 

16072
08:37:12,734 --> 08:37:13,602
ACTUALLY CAN'T POINT TO ANY 

16073
08:37:13,602 --> 08:37:19,041
SPECIFIC INSTANCE LIKE THAT. 

16074
08:37:19,041 --> 08:37:20,542
>> THE QUOTE THAT JUMPED OUT AT 

16075
08:37:20,542 --> 08:37:21,710
ME WAS BRETT WAS A SLOPPY DRUNK 

16076
08:37:21,710 --> 08:37:23,045
AND I KNOW BECAUSE I DRINK WITH 

16077
08:37:23,045 --> 08:37:23,245
HIM. 

16078
08:37:23,245 --> 08:37:24,446
>> I DON'T -- I DO NOT THINK 

16079
08:37:24,446 --> 08:37:30,386
THAT IS A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION 

16080
08:37:30,386 --> 08:37:32,387
AND CHRIS DUDLEY IS QUOTED IN 

16081
08:37:32,387 --> 08:37:33,689
THAT ARTICLE. I 

16082
08:37:33,689 --> 08:37:35,290
WOULD REFER YOU TO WHAT CHRIS 

16083
08:37:35,290 --> 08:37:35,657
DUDLEY SAID. 

16084
08:37:35,657 --> 08:37:37,359
I SPENT MORE TIME WITH CHRIS 

16085
08:37:37,359 --> 08:37:39,027
DUDLEY IN COLLEGE THAN JUST 

16086
08:37:39,027 --> 08:37:40,596
ABOUT ANYONE AND I REFER YOU TO 

16087
08:37:40,596 --> 08:37:41,162
WHAT HE SAID. 

16088
08:37:41,162 --> 08:37:43,966
>> AND OTHER REPORTING, AS I'M 

16089
08:37:43,966 --> 08:37:45,000
SURE YOU KNOW, A COLLEGE 

16090
08:37:45,000 --> 08:37:46,768
CLASSMATE DESCRIBED YOU AS 

16091
08:37:46,768 --> 08:37:48,537
RELATIVELY SHY BUT SAID WHEN 

16092
08:37:48,537 --> 08:37:50,005
YOU'RE DRANK YOU COULD BE 

16093
08:37:50,005 --> 08:37:51,840
AGGRESSIVE OR EVEN BELLIGERENT. 

16094
08:37:51,840 --> 08:37:53,542
YOUR ROOMMATE, AS YOU DISCUSS 

16095
08:37:53,542 --> 08:37:55,377
WITH SENATOR KLOBUCHAR SAID YOU 

16096
08:37:55,377 --> 08:37:56,478
WERE FREQUENTLY DRUNK. 

16097
08:37:56,478 --> 08:37:58,180
>> THAT ROOMMATE -- THAT WAS 

16098
08:37:58,180 --> 08:37:59,314
FRESHMAN YEAR ROOMMATE -- THERE 

16099
08:37:59,314 --> 08:38:00,916
WAS CONTENTION BETWEEN HIM AND 

16100
08:38:00,916 --> 08:38:01,316
THE THIRD PERSON. 

16101
08:38:01,316 --> 08:38:03,285
THERE WERE THREE OF US IN A 

16102
08:38:03,285 --> 08:38:04,419
SMALL ROOM AND YOU SHOULD LOOK 

16103
08:38:04,419 --> 08:38:05,788
AT WHAT I SAID IN THE REDACTED 

16104
08:38:05,788 --> 08:38:07,055
PORTION OF THE TRANSCRIPT ABOUT 

16105
08:38:07,055 --> 08:38:10,859
HIM AND YOU SHOULD ASSESS HIS 

16106
08:38:10,859 --> 08:38:12,160
CREDIBILITY WITH THAT IN MIND. 

16107
08:38:12,160 --> 08:38:13,629
>> PUT YOURSELF IN OUR SHOES 

16108
08:38:13,629 --> 08:38:16,298
FOR A MOMENT, IF YOU WHAT, 

16109
08:38:16,298 --> 08:38:16,598
JUDGE. I 

16110
08:38:16,598 --> 08:38:19,034
KNOW THAT'S ASKING A LOT OF YOU 

16111
08:38:19,034 --> 08:38:19,668
IN THIS SETTING. 

16112
08:38:19,668 --> 08:38:21,703
SUPPOSE YOU HAD GONE THROUGH A 

16113
08:38:21,703 --> 08:38:22,504
PROCESS TO SELECT SOMEONE FOR 

16114
08:38:22,504 --> 08:38:24,473
AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT JOB AND 

16115
08:38:24,473 --> 08:38:25,774
A POSITION WHERE YOU HAD A LOT 

16116
08:38:25,774 --> 08:38:27,643
OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AND AS 

16117
08:38:27,643 --> 08:38:29,177
HE FINISHED THE HIRING PROCESS, 

16118
08:38:29,177 --> 08:38:31,013
YOU LEARN OF A CREDIBLE 

16119
08:38:31,013 --> 08:38:34,283
ALLEGATION THAT, IF TRUE, WOULD 

16120
08:38:34,283 --> 08:38:34,683
BE DISQUALIFYING. 

16121
08:38:34,683 --> 08:38:36,818
WOULD YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND 

16122
08:38:36,818 --> 08:38:38,587
TAKE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OR 

16123
08:38:38,587 --> 08:38:40,222
MOVE TO A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE? 

16124
08:38:40,222 --> 08:38:42,858
WHY NOT AGREE TO A ONE-WEEK 

16125
08:38:42,858 --> 08:38:44,826
PAUSE TO ALLOW THE FBI TO 

16126
08:38:44,826 --> 08:38:45,694

EITHER CLEAR YOUR NAME OR 

16133

RESOLVE THESE ALLEGATIONS BY 

16134
08:38:58,540 --> 08:38:59,975

08:39:05,280 --> 08:39:06,582
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN INCLUDING DR.

08:39:06,582 --> 08:39:07,149
FORD'S LONGTIME FRIEND, MS. 

16139
08:39:07,149 --> 08:39:08,584
LELAND KEYSER WHO SAID SHE 

16140
08:39:08,584 --> 08:39:10,318
DIDN'T KNOW ME AND THAT SHE 

16141
08:39:10,318 --> 08:39:12,087
DOES NOT RECALL EVER BEING AT A

DR. FORD. 

16144

>> WHAT I STRUGGLED WITH, JUDGE 

16145
08:39:18,827 --> 08:39:20,862
KAVANAUGH, IS THE ABSENCE OF 

16146
08:39:20,862 --> 08:39:22,264
FAIR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 

16147
08:39:22,264 --> 08:39:23,498
DRIVEN NONPARTISAN PROCESS TO

I THINK ARE CRITICAL TO THIS. 

16150
08:39:27,302 --> 08:39:28,470
MY CONCERN, SHOULD YOU MOVE 

16151
08:39:28,470 --> 08:39:29,838
FORWARD, IS WHAT IT WILL DO TO 

16152
08:39:29,838 --> 08:39:35,010
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE COURT 

16153
08:39:35,010 --> 08:39:37,779
AND HOW THAT MAY WELL HANG OVER 

16154

DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE LAST 

16162
08:39:51,460 --> 08:39:52,661
10 DAYS HAVE BEEN FOR US? 

16163
08:39:52,661 --> 08:39:57,065
>> PROBABLY AN ETERNITY. 

16164
08:39:57,065 --> 08:39:57,632
>> FOR US, EVERY DAY -- 

16165

YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN 

16168
08:40:07,009 --> 08:40:08,210
INVESTIGATED AND ALL FOUR 

16169
08:40:08,210 --> 08:40:09,645
WITNESSES SAY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 

16170
08:40:09,645 --> 08:40:10,612
AND THEY'VE SAID IT UNDER 

16171
08:40:10,612 --> 08:40:11,346
PENALTY OF FELONY. 

16172
08:40:11,346 --> 08:40:12,147
I'VE PRODUCED MY CALENDARS, 

16173
08:40:12,147 --> 08:40:14,917

16174

16180
08:40:29,831 --> 08:40:30,832
LEE, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE 

16181
08:40:30,832 --> 08:40:31,199
SOMETHING HERE. 

16182
08:40:31,199 --> 08:40:32,367
TALKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING 

16183
08:40:32,367 --> 08:40:34,903
WITHOUT ENOUGH TIME -- WE HAD 

16184
08:40:34,903 --> 08:40:43,745
45 DAYS BETWEEN JULY 30 AND 

16185
08:40:43,745 --> 08:40:45,147
SEPTEMBER 13, I BELIEVE IT IS, 

16186
08:40:45,147 --> 08:40:46,615
WHEN WE COULD HAVE BEEN 

16187
08:40:46,615 --> 08:40:50,652
INVESTIGATING THIS. IN REGARD 

16188
08:40:50,652 --> 08:40:53,054
TO THIS CANDIDATE, IF YOU TAKE 

16189
08:40:53,054 --> 08:40:54,489
THE AVERAGE OF 65-70 DAYS 

16190
08:40:54,489 --> 08:40:56,592
BETWEEN THE TIME THAT A PERSON 

16191
08:40:56,592 --> 08:40:58,660
IS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT 

16192
08:40:58,660 --> 08:41:04,633
AND THE SENATE VOTES ON IT, 

16193
08:41:04,633 --> 08:41:05,934
IT'S ABOUT 65-70 DAYS AND HERE 

16194
08:41:05,934 --> 08:41:11,973
WE ARE AT 85-90 DAYS. 

16195
08:41:11,973 --> 08:41:13,074
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME PUT IN 

16196
08:41:13,074 --> 08:41:14,209
ON THIS NOMINATION. 

16197
08:41:14,209 --> 08:41:14,776
SENATOR LEE? 

16198
08:41:14,776 --> 08:41:15,377
WAIT A MINUTE. I 

16199
08:41:15,377 --> 08:41:16,445
HAVE ONE OTHER THING. 

16200
08:41:16,445 --> 08:41:17,545
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS BEEN PUTTING 

16201
08:41:17,545 --> 08:41:24,553
LETTERS IN THE RECORD. 

16202
08:41:24,553 --> 08:41:26,388
I HAVE A LETTER HERE FROM 65 

16203
08:41:26,388 --> 08:41:28,156
WOMEN WHO KNEW JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

16204
08:41:28,156 --> 08:41:31,026
BETWEEN THE YEARS 1979 AND 1983,

16205
08:41:31,026 --> 08:41:32,928
THE YEARS HE ATTENDED 

16206
08:41:32,928 --> 08:41:33,861
GEORGETOWN PREP HIGH SCHOOL. 

16207
08:41:33,861 --> 08:41:35,931
THESE WOMEN WROTE TO THE 

16208
08:41:35,931 --> 08:41:37,666
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THEY KNOW 

16209
08:41:37,666 --> 08:41:39,868
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND THEY KNOW 

16210
08:41:39,868 --> 08:41:41,870
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS RAISED BY 

16211
08:41:41,870 --> 08:41:42,771
DR. FORD ARE COMPLETELY, 

16212
08:41:42,771 --> 08:41:44,039
TOTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH HIS 

16213
08:41:44,039 --> 08:41:45,006
CHARACTER. 

16214
08:41:45,006 --> 08:41:47,008
THESE 65 WOMEN KNOW HIM THROUGH 

16215
08:41:47,008 --> 08:41:48,844
SOCIAL EVENTS AND CHURCH AND 

16216
08:41:48,844 --> 08:41:50,312
MANY HAVE REMAINED CLOSE 

16217
08:41:50,312 --> 08:41:51,580
FRIENDS WITH HIM. 

16218
08:41:51,580 --> 08:41:52,614
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAY, PARTLY 

16219
08:41:52,614 --> 08:41:53,415
QUOTING THE LETTER. 

16220
08:41:53,415 --> 08:41:56,385
, QUOTE, THROUGH THE MORE THAN 

16221
08:41:56,385 --> 08:41:58,920
35 YEARS WE'VE KNOWN HIM, BRETT 

16222
08:41:58,920 --> 08:42:00,288
HAS STOOD OUT FOR HIS 

16223
08:42:00,288 --> 08:42:01,523
FRIENDSHIP, CHARACTER AND 

16224
08:42:01,523 --> 08:42:01,823
INTEGRITY. 

16225
08:42:01,823 --> 08:42:03,492
HE HAS ALWAYS TREATED WOMEN 

16226
08:42:03,492 --> 08:42:04,659
WITH DECENCY AND RESPECT. 

16227
08:42:04,659 --> 08:42:07,028
THAT WAS TRUE IN HIGH SCHOOL 

16228
08:42:07,028 --> 08:42:09,431
AND REMAINS TRUE TO THIS DAY. 

16229
08:42:09,431 --> 08:42:11,600
IN CLOSING, THEY WROTE JUDGE 

16230
08:42:11,600 --> 08:42:12,901
KAVANAUGH, QUOTE, HAS ALWAYS 

16231
08:42:12,901 --> 08:42:14,903
BEEN A GOOD PERSON. 

16232
08:42:14,903 --> 08:42:17,272
WITHOUT OBJECTION, I PUT IT IN 

16233
08:42:17,272 --> 08:42:18,707
THE RECORD. 

16234
08:42:18,707 --> 08:42:19,040
SENATOR LEE? 

16235
08:42:19,040 --> 08:42:20,342
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU'VE BEEN 

16236
08:42:20,342 --> 08:42:21,743
COOPERATIVE AT EVERY STAGE OF 

16237
08:42:21,743 --> 08:42:22,411
THE INVESTIGATION, THE 

16238
08:42:22,411 --> 08:42:23,845
BACKGROUND AND THE 

16239
08:42:23,845 --> 08:42:24,846
INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE 

16240
08:42:24,846 --> 08:42:25,547
COMMITTEE. 

16241
08:42:25,547 --> 08:42:26,715
IS THAT CORRECT? 

16242
08:42:26,715 --> 08:42:26,948
>> YES. 

16243
08:42:26,948 --> 08:42:29,518
>> IT'S ALSO CORRECT THAT YOU 

16244
08:42:29,518 --> 08:42:31,353
DO NOT CONTROL THE FBI OR WHEN 

16245
08:42:31,353 --> 08:42:34,056
IT CONDUCTS AN INVESTIGATION. 

16246
08:42:34,056 --> 08:42:38,693
YOU ARE A NOMINEE, NOT TASKED 

16247
08:42:38,693 --> 08:42:40,095
WITH THE JOB OF DECIDING WHO 

16248
08:42:40,095 --> 08:42:41,129
AND HOW AN INVESTIGATION WILL 

16249
08:42:41,129 --> 08:42:41,462
BE CONDUCTED? 

16250
08:42:41,462 --> 08:42:41,929
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 

16251
08:42:41,929 --> 08:42:44,466
>> IN EVERY MOMENT WHEN WE OR 

16252
08:42:44,466 --> 08:42:46,535
PRIOR TO THE JURISDICTION, THE 

16253
08:42:46,535 --> 08:42:48,036
FBI HAS ASKED YOU QUESTIONS, 

16254
08:42:48,036 --> 08:42:49,371
YOU'VE BEEN ATTENTIVE AND 

16255
08:42:49,371 --> 08:42:50,672
RESPONSIVE, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 

16256
08:42:50,672 --> 08:42:54,109
>> THAT'S CORRECT, THROUGHOUT 

16257
08:42:54,109 --> 08:42:54,576
MY CAREER. 

16258
08:42:54,576 --> 08:42:56,311
>> I HAVE COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE 

16259
08:42:56,311 --> 08:42:57,312
REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR AN FBI 

16260
08:42:57,312 --> 08:42:58,213
INVESTIGATION AND THERE ARE 

16261
08:42:58,213 --> 08:43:01,183
SOME IRONIES IN THIS. 

16262
08:43:01,183 --> 08:43:03,685
IRONIES THAT I'VE SAID ARE AT 

16263
08:43:03,685 --> 08:43:04,185
AT LEAST TWO LEVELS. 

16264
08:43:04,185 --> 08:43:05,620
AND THE FIRST PLACE, AT LEAST 

16265
08:43:05,620 --> 08:43:08,590
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES, AT LEAST 

16266
08:43:08,590 --> 08:43:10,358
ONE OF THEM, HAD ACCESS TO THIS 

16267
08:43:10,358 --> 08:43:11,126
INFORMATION MANY, MANY WEEKS 

16268
08:43:11,126 --> 08:43:12,294
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DID. 

16269
08:43:12,294 --> 08:43:16,164
HAD THE ABILITY AND I BELIEVE 

16270
08:43:16,164 --> 08:43:17,232
THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO REPORT 

16271
08:43:17,232 --> 08:43:18,767
THOSE FACTS TO THE FBI. 

16272
08:43:18,767 --> 08:43:20,435
AT THAT POINT, THEY COULD HAVE 

16273
08:43:20,435 --> 08:43:21,403
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN 

16274
08:43:21,403 --> 08:43:22,604
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI AND IT 

16275
08:43:22,604 --> 08:43:24,272
COULD'VE BEEN HANDLED IN SUCH A 

16276
08:43:24,272 --> 08:43:25,540
WAY THAT DIDN'T TURN THIS INTO 

16277
08:43:25,540 --> 08:43:27,209
A CIRCUS, ONE THAT TURNED YOUR 

16278
08:43:27,209 --> 08:43:29,110
LIFE UPSIDE DOWN AND THAT OF 

16279
08:43:29,110 --> 08:43:32,180
YOUR FAMILY AND THE LIFE OF DR. 

16280
08:43:32,180 --> 08:43:34,549
FORD AND HER FAMILY -- UPSIDE 

16281
08:43:34,549 --> 08:43:35,250
DOWN. I 

16282
08:43:35,250 --> 08:43:36,518
CONSIDER THIS MOST UNFORTUNATE 

16283
08:43:36,518 --> 08:43:38,086
GIVEN THAT IT'S ENTIRELY WITHIN 

16284
08:43:38,086 --> 08:43:39,488
THE CONTROL OF AT LEAST ONE OF 

16285
08:43:39,488 --> 08:43:40,322
MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES TO DO 

16286
08:43:40,322 --> 08:43:40,522
THIS. 

16287
08:43:40,522 --> 08:43:43,959
THE SECOND LEVEL OF IRONY HERE 

16288
08:43:43,959 --> 08:43:45,160
IS THAT WHILE CALLING 

16289
08:43:45,160 --> 08:43:46,461
REPEATEDLY FOR AN INVESTIGATION 

16290
08:43:46,461 --> 08:43:48,163
BY THE FBI, AND INVESTIGATION 

16291
08:43:48,163 --> 08:43:50,398
OVER WHICH YOU HAVE NO ABILITY 

16292
08:43:50,398 --> 08:43:51,800
TO CONTROL, BY THE WAY, AND 

16293
08:43:51,800 --> 08:43:53,134
INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE NO 

16294
08:43:53,134 --> 08:43:55,871
AUTHORITY TO CALL FOR -- WE ARE 

16295
08:43:55,871 --> 08:43:57,172
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION 

16296
08:43:57,172 --> 08:43:58,940
THAT INVOLVES QUESTIONS TO YOU. 

16297
08:43:58,940 --> 08:44:00,475
I ASKED MY DEMOCRATIC 

16298
08:44:00,475 --> 08:44:01,543
COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE TWO 

16299
08:44:01,543 --> 08:44:03,011
QUESTIONS FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

16300
08:44:03,011 --> 08:44:03,278
ASK HIM. 

16301
08:44:03,278 --> 08:44:04,279
HE'S RIGHT HERE. 

16302
08:44:04,279 --> 08:44:06,915
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT IS THE 

16303
08:44:06,915 --> 08:44:09,117
TRUTH, ASK HIM QUESTIONS RIGHT 

16304
08:44:09,117 --> 08:44:09,651
NOW. 

16305
08:44:09,651 --> 08:44:11,520
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OF OTHER 

16306
08:44:11,520 --> 08:44:13,355
WITNESSES, FOR THE LOVE THAT IS 

16307
08:44:13,355 --> 08:44:15,624
SACRED AND HOLY, PARTICIPATE IN 

16308
08:44:15,624 --> 08:44:16,558
THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIONS 

16309
08:44:16,558 --> 08:44:19,060
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON AS YOU 

16310
08:44:19,060 --> 08:44:20,528
HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICIPATING. 

16311
08:44:20,528 --> 08:44:21,730
WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF 

16312
08:44:21,730 --> 08:44:22,831
INVESTIGATING THE OUTSIDE 

16313
08:44:22,831 --> 08:44:24,666
WITNESSES, IF SOMEONE WERE 

16314
08:44:24,666 --> 08:44:25,700
INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH, THIS 

16315
08:44:25,700 --> 08:44:27,469
IS WHAT THEY WOULD DO. 

16316
08:44:27,469 --> 08:44:29,638
THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE 

16317
08:44:29,638 --> 08:44:30,439
INVESTIGATION AND WHEN WE HAVE 

16318
08:44:30,439 --> 08:44:31,439
A COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION, A 

16319
08:44:31,439 --> 08:44:34,242
COMMITTEE HEARING WITH LIVE 

16320
08:44:34,242 --> 08:44:35,210
WITNESSES, THEY WOULD TALK 

16321
08:44:35,210 --> 08:44:35,777
ABOUT THAT RATHER THAN 

16322
08:44:35,777 --> 08:44:37,178
SOMETHING ELSE THEY WISHED THEY 

16323
08:44:37,178 --> 08:44:38,780
WERE HAVING IN FRONT OF THEM. 

16324
08:44:38,780 --> 08:44:40,382
IF WHAT THEY WANT IS A SEARCH 

16325
08:44:40,382 --> 08:44:42,050
FOR THE TRUTH, THEN NOW IS THE 

16326
08:44:42,050 --> 08:44:42,283
CHOICE. 

16327
08:44:42,283 --> 08:44:45,187
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WHAT THEY 

16328
08:44:45,187 --> 08:44:47,455
WANT TO DO IS DELAY THIS UNTIL 

16329
08:44:47,455 --> 08:44:48,356
AFTER THE ELECTION, WHICH AT 

16330
08:44:48,356 --> 08:44:49,891
LEAST ONE OF MY ELECTION 

16331
08:44:49,891 --> 08:44:51,493
COLLATE -- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES 

16332
08:44:51,493 --> 08:44:53,395
HAS ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT MIGHT BE 

16333
08:44:53,395 --> 08:44:54,695
WHAT THEY WOULD DO. 

16334
08:44:54,695 --> 08:44:57,832
FINALLY, I WANT TO POINT OUT 

16335
08:44:57,832 --> 08:44:58,499
THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT 

16336
08:44:58,499 --> 08:44:59,401
PRECEDENT FROM OUR FORMER 

16337
08:44:59,401 --> 08:45:00,001
CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE, 

16338
08:45:00,001 --> 08:45:01,803
CHAIRMAN JOE BIDEN. 

16339
08:45:01,803 --> 08:45:02,604
DURING THE CLARENCE THOMAS 

16340
08:45:02,604 --> 08:45:06,708
HEARINGS, NEARLY THREE DECADES 

16341
08:45:06,708 --> 08:45:11,012
AGO, CHAIRMAN BIDEN MADE SOME 

16342
08:45:11,012 --> 08:45:12,647
INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS ABOUT 

16343
08:45:12,647 --> 08:45:14,416
FBI REPORTS AND THEIR ROLE IN 

16344
08:45:14,416 --> 08:45:14,749
THIS PROCESS. 

16345
08:45:14,749 --> 08:45:17,919
HE SAID, QUOTE, THE NEXT PERSON 

16346
08:45:17,919 --> 08:45:20,655
WHO REFERS TO THE FBI REPORT AS 

16347
08:45:20,655 --> 08:45:21,422
BEING WORTH ANYTHING, OBVIOUSLY 

16348
08:45:21,422 --> 08:45:22,090
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. 

16349
08:45:22,090 --> 08:45:23,191
THE FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN 

16350
08:45:23,191 --> 08:45:24,893
THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE REACH A 

16351
08:45:24,893 --> 08:45:31,066
CONCLUSION, PERIOD. 

16352
08:45:31,066 --> 08:45:32,067
THOSE ARE HIS COMMENTS, NOT 

16353
08:45:32,067 --> 08:45:32,267
MINE. 

16354
08:45:32,267 --> 08:45:33,301
THE REASON WE CANNOT RELY ON 

16355
08:45:33,301 --> 08:45:38,272
THE FBI REPORT, YOU WOULD NOT 

16356
08:45:38,272 --> 08:45:39,507
LIKE IT IF WE DID. 

16357
08:45:39,507 --> 08:45:41,209
BECAUSE, IT IS INCONCLUSIVE. 

16358
08:45:41,209 --> 08:45:43,745
WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE AND FBI 

16359
08:45:43,745 --> 08:45:45,313
REPORT BEFORE YOU, UNDERSTAND 

16360
08:45:45,313 --> 08:45:48,550
THEY DO NOT, THEY DO NOT REACH 

16361
08:45:48,550 --> 08:45:48,883
CONCLUSIONS. 

16362
08:45:48,883 --> 08:45:50,819
THEY DO NOT MAKE -- AS MY 

16363
08:45:50,819 --> 08:45:51,853
FRIEND POINTS OUT MORE 

16364
08:45:51,853 --> 08:45:53,521
ACCURATELY -- THEY DO NOT MAKE 

16365
08:45:53,521 --> 08:45:53,921
RECOMMENDATIONS. 

16366
08:45:53,921 --> 08:45:56,024
IN OTHER WORDS, THE ROLE OF THE 

16367
08:45:56,024 --> 08:45:57,392
FBI IS TO FLAKE ISSUES AND 

16368
08:45:57,392 --> 08:45:58,860
THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN FLAGGED. 

16369
08:45:58,860 --> 08:46:00,061
SAID THE, IN THIS CASE, THEY 

16370
08:46:00,061 --> 08:46:01,997
WERE NOT FLAGGED AS THEY SHOULD 

16371
08:46:01,997 --> 08:46:03,832
HAVE BEEN OR THE TIMING THEY 

16372
08:46:03,832 --> 08:46:05,500
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THEREFORE, 

16373
08:46:05,500 --> 08:46:06,501
THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN 

16374
08:46:06,501 --> 08:46:07,569
ADDRESSED IN THE MANNER THAT 

16375
08:46:07,569 --> 08:46:09,004
WOULD'VE PRESERVED A LOT MORE 

16376
08:46:09,004 --> 08:46:11,406
DIGNITY FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY AND

16377
08:46:11,406 --> 08:46:12,373
DR. FORD AND HER FAMILY. 

16378
08:46:12,373 --> 08:46:13,208
THEY WERE INSTEAD, HELD OUT 

16379
08:46:13,208 --> 08:46:18,412
UNTIL THE FINAL MOMENT. I 

16380
08:46:18,412 --> 08:46:21,115
CONSIDER THAT MOST UNFORTUNATE. 

16381
08:46:21,115 --> 08:46:23,551
FOR THAT, ON BEHALF OF THIS 

16382
08:46:23,551 --> 08:46:25,186
COMMITTEE, I EXTEND TO MY MOST 

16383
08:46:25,186 --> 08:46:25,920
PROFOUND SYMPATHIES. 

16384
08:46:25,920 --> 08:46:26,588
AND, MY MOST PROFOUND 

16385
08:46:26,588 --> 08:46:27,656
SYMPATHIES TO DR. FORD AND HER 

16386
08:46:27,656 --> 08:46:32,427
FAMILY, AS WELL. 

16387
08:46:32,427 --> 08:46:34,629
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, SINCE WE DON'T 

16388
08:46:34,629 --> 08:46:35,764
HAVE ENOUGH SLOTS, CAN I HAVE 

16389
08:46:35,764 --> 08:46:36,931
THE LAST MINUTE OR -- THE LAST 

16390
08:46:36,931 --> 08:46:39,734
MINUTE OF SENATOR LEE? 

16391
08:46:39,734 --> 08:46:40,968
JUDGE, WE DID 38 HOURS IN 

16392
08:46:40,968 --> 08:46:41,636
PUBLIC WITH YOU. 

16393
08:46:41,636 --> 08:46:42,403
DID WE HAVE ANY PRIVATE 

16394
08:46:42,403 --> 08:46:46,074
HEARINGS WITH YOU? 

16395
08:46:46,074 --> 08:46:46,307
>> YES. 

16396
08:46:46,307 --> 08:46:50,478
>> WAS AT A FUN TIME FOR YOU 

16397
08:46:50,478 --> 08:46:51,980
WHEN SENATORS COULD ASK 

16398
08:46:51,980 --> 08:46:52,914
QUESTIONS THAT WERE AWKWARD OR 

16399
08:46:52,914 --> 08:46:53,547
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT POTENTIAL 

16400
08:46:53,547 --> 08:46:54,582
ALCOHOLISM, GAMBLING ADDICTION, 

16401
08:46:54,582 --> 08:46:57,819
CREDIT CARD DEBT? IF BUDDIES 

16402
08:46:57,819 --> 08:46:59,921
FLOATED MONEY TO BUY BASEBALL 

16403
08:46:59,921 --> 08:47:00,188
TICKETS? 

16404
08:47:00,188 --> 08:47:03,925
DID YOU ENJOY THE TIME WE SPENT 

16405
08:47:03,925 --> 08:47:04,292
LATE ONE NIGHT? 

16406
08:47:04,292 --> 08:47:06,360
>> I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO 

16407
08:47:06,360 --> 08:47:07,729
COOPERATE WITH THE COMMITTEE. 

16408
08:47:07,729 --> 08:47:08,196
>> THAT'S CHARITABLE. 

16409
08:47:08,196 --> 08:47:10,665
WERE YOU EVER ASKED ABOUT ANY 

16410
08:47:10,665 --> 08:47:12,801
SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS WHEN WE HAD 

16411
08:47:12,801 --> 08:47:14,502
THAT TIME WITH YOU ALONE? 

16412
08:47:14,502 --> 08:47:15,736
>> NO. 

16413
08:47:15,736 --> 08:47:17,505
INSPECTED THE RANKING MEMBER 

16414
08:47:17,505 --> 08:47:18,807
ALREADY HAVE THESE ALLEGATIONS 

16415
08:47:18,807 --> 08:47:20,241
FOR -- THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN 

16416
08:47:20,241 --> 08:47:20,942
SEPTEMBER 6TH OR SEPTEMBER 7TH 

16417
08:47:20,942 --> 08:47:22,544
AND THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN JULY 

16418
08:47:22,544 --> 08:47:25,413
30TH. 

16419
08:47:25,413 --> 08:47:26,214
IT WAS A RECOMMENDATION THAT 

16420
08:47:26,214 --> 08:47:27,248
WAS MADE BY THE RANKING MEMBER 

16421
08:47:27,248 --> 08:47:31,853
OR HER STAFF TO DR. FORD? 

16422
08:47:31,853 --> 08:47:34,122
BY THE WAY, I THINK DR. FORD IS 

16423
08:47:34,122 --> 08:47:35,657
A VICTIM AND I THINK SHE'S BEEN 

16424
08:47:35,657 --> 08:47:35,990
THROUGH HECK. 

16425
08:47:35,990 --> 08:47:40,595
I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO HER. 

16426
08:47:40,595 --> 08:47:41,596
BUT, DID THE RANKING MEMBER'S 

16427
08:47:41,596 --> 08:47:42,430
STAFF MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO 

16428
08:47:42,430 --> 08:47:44,599
HIRE A LAWYER AND SHE KNEW ALL 

16429
08:47:44,599 --> 08:47:46,735
OF THAT AND YET WE HAD A 

16430
08:47:46,735 --> 08:47:47,936
HEARING HERE WITH YOU AND NONE 

16431
08:47:47,936 --> 08:47:48,870
OF THESE THINGS WERE ASKED? 

16432
08:47:48,870 --> 08:47:49,571
WHEN THE PROCESS WAS CLOSED, 

16433
08:47:49,571 --> 08:47:53,908
AND WHEN WE WERE DONE MEETING 

16434
08:47:53,908 --> 08:47:56,411
IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THIS WAS 

16435
08:47:56,411 --> 08:47:58,079
SPRUNG ON YOU? I 

16436
08:47:58,079 --> 08:48:01,616
WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE THE 

16437
08:48:01,616 --> 08:48:01,983
DATES CORRECT. 

16438
08:48:01,983 --> 08:48:03,851
WE'VE GOT 35 PLUS DAYS FROM ALL 

16439
08:48:03,851 --> 08:48:05,320
THE TIME THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS 

16440
08:48:05,320 --> 08:48:07,021
IN THE HANDS, RECOMMENDATIONS 

16441
08:48:07,021 --> 08:48:07,955
WERE MADE TO AN OUTSIDE LAWYER 

16442
08:48:07,955 --> 08:48:09,858
AND YOU COULD HAVE HANDLED THIS 

16443
08:48:09,858 --> 08:48:10,692
AND WE COULD'VE HAD THIS 

16444
08:48:10,692 --> 08:48:11,860
CONVERSATION IN PRIVATE IN A 

16445
08:48:11,860 --> 08:48:12,860
WAY THAT DIDN'T DO CRAP TO HIS 

16446
08:48:12,860 --> 08:48:21,102
FAMILY BUT -- I YIELD MY TIME. 

16447
08:48:21,102 --> 08:48:23,004
TRYING TO SEE IF HE COULD DO 

16448
08:48:23,004 --> 08:48:24,806
MATH ABOUT 35 DAYS. 

16449
08:48:24,806 --> 08:48:28,209
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A 

16450
08:48:28,209 --> 08:48:28,475
QUESTION. 

16451
08:48:28,475 --> 08:48:30,278
>> THANKS, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

16452
08:48:30,278 --> 08:48:30,912
AN AFTERNOON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

16453
08:48:30,912 --> 08:48:31,846
AS A FEDERAL JUDGE, YOU ARE 

16454
08:48:31,846 --> 08:48:38,853
AWARE OF THE JURY INSTRUCTION, 

16455
08:48:38,853 --> 08:48:46,961
ARE YOU NOT? 

16456
08:48:46,961 --> 08:48:48,363
YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT JURY 

16457
08:48:48,363 --> 08:48:48,696
INSTRUCTION? 

16458
08:48:48,696 --> 08:48:49,264
YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? 

16459
08:48:49,264 --> 08:48:50,231
>> YOU CAN TRANSLATE IT BETTER 

16460
08:48:50,231 --> 08:48:52,567
THAN I CAN. 

16461
08:48:52,567 --> 08:48:55,036
FALLS IN ONE THING, FALLS IN 

16462
08:48:55,036 --> 08:48:58,840
EVERYTHING. 

16463
08:48:58,840 --> 08:49:01,342
SOME OF US HAVE HEARD MANY 

16464
08:49:01,342 --> 08:49:04,546
TIMES, IS TO TELL THE JURY THEY 

16465
08:49:04,546 --> 08:49:06,047
CAN DISBELIEVE A WITNESS IF 

16466
08:49:06,047 --> 08:49:07,782
THEY FIND HIM TO BE FALSE IN 

16467
08:49:07,782 --> 08:49:12,086
ONE THING, AND THE CORE OF WHY 

16468
08:49:12,086 --> 08:49:13,588
WE ARE HERE TODAY REALLY IS 

16469
08:49:13,588 --> 08:49:18,927
CREDIBILITY. 

16470
08:49:18,927 --> 08:49:22,363
>> THE CORE OF WHY WE ARE HERE 

16471
08:49:22,363 --> 08:49:24,265
IS AN ALLEGATION FOR WHICH THE 

16472
08:49:24,265 --> 08:49:25,667
FOUR WITNESSES PRESENT HAVE ALL 

16473
08:49:25,667 --> 08:49:26,267
SAID IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

16474
08:49:26,267 --> 08:49:27,735
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT RENATE 

16475
08:49:27,735 --> 08:49:28,503
DOLPHIN WHO LIVES IN 

16476
08:49:28,503 --> 08:49:32,640
CONNECTICUT. 

16477
08:49:32,640 --> 08:49:33,374
SHE THOUGHT THESE YEARBOOK 

16478
08:49:33,374 --> 08:49:34,242
STATEMENTS WERE, QUOTE, 

16479
08:49:34,242 --> 08:49:35,109
HORRIBLE, HURTFUL AND SIMPLY 

16480
08:49:35,109 --> 08:49:39,147
UNTRUE. 

16481
08:49:39,147 --> 08:49:47,054
BECAUSE, RENATE ALUMNI CLEARLY 

16482
08:49:47,054 --> 08:49:48,422
IMPLIED A BOAST OF SEXUAL 

16483
08:49:48,422 --> 08:49:49,824
CONQUEST AND THAT IS THE REASON 

16484
08:49:49,824 --> 08:49:50,892
YOU APOLOGIZED TO HER, CORRECT? 

16485
08:49:50,892 --> 08:49:56,064
>> THAT'S FALSE. SPEAKING ABOUT 

16486
08:49:56,064 --> 08:49:57,198
THE YEARBOOK, SHE SAID SHE AND 

16487
08:49:57,198 --> 08:49:58,032
I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 

16488
08:49:58,032 --> 08:49:58,365
INTERACTIONS. 

16489
08:49:58,365 --> 08:50:03,471
>> THE QUESTION IS FALSE AND I 

16490
08:50:03,471 --> 08:50:04,638
ADDRESSED THAT IN THE OPENING 

16491
08:50:04,638 --> 08:50:05,306
STATEMENT. 

16492
08:50:05,306 --> 08:50:06,941
SO, YOUR QUESTION IS BASED ON A 

16493
08:50:06,941 --> 08:50:08,810
FALSE PREMISE AND REALLY DOES 

16494
08:50:08,810 --> 08:50:10,044
GREAT HARM TO HER. 

16495
08:50:10,044 --> 08:50:11,145
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ARE 

16496
08:50:11,145 --> 08:50:13,414
BRINGING THIS UP, FRANKLY. 

16497
08:50:13,414 --> 08:50:16,417
YOU ARE DOING GREAT HARM TO HER 

16498
08:50:16,417 --> 08:50:17,084
BY BRINGING HER NAME APPEAR. 

16499
08:50:17,084 --> 08:50:17,718
IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE. 

16500
08:50:17,718 --> 08:50:28,429
>> CALLING SOMEONE AN ALUMNUS 

16501
08:50:28,429 --> 08:50:28,963
IN THAT WAY -- 

16502
08:50:28,963 --> 08:50:29,964
>> IMPLYING WHAT YOU ARE 

16503
08:50:29,964 --> 08:50:30,264
APPLYING -- 

16504
08:50:30,264 --> 08:50:31,532
>> BY A NUMBER OF YOUR FOOTBALL 

16505
08:50:31,532 --> 08:50:32,300
FRIENDS, AT THE TIME, IS 

16506
08:50:32,300 --> 08:50:33,167
BOASTING OF SEXUAL CONQUEST. 

16507
08:50:33,167 --> 08:50:34,002
THAT'S THE REASON I'M BRINGING 

16508
08:50:34,002 --> 08:50:34,402
IT UP. 

16509
08:50:34,402 --> 08:50:34,769
>> IT'S FALSE. 

16510
08:50:34,769 --> 08:50:35,303
YOU ARE APPLYING IT. 

16511
08:50:35,303 --> 08:50:36,971
LOOK WHAT YOU ARE BRINGING UP 

16512
08:50:36,971 --> 08:50:37,538
ABOUT HER. 

16513
08:50:37,538 --> 08:50:39,340
LOOK WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 

16514
08:50:39,340 --> 08:50:40,941
YOU BRING HER NAME UP. 

16515
08:50:40,941 --> 08:50:43,544
>> DON'T SUBTRACT FROM MY TIME. 

16516
08:50:43,544 --> 08:50:44,979
>> ASK YOUR QUESTION -- 

16517
08:50:44,979 --> 08:50:46,680
>> SHE'S A GREAT PERSON. 

16518
08:50:46,680 --> 08:50:48,383
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT 

16519
08:50:48,383 --> 08:50:48,616
PERSON. 

16520
08:50:48,616 --> 08:50:50,118
WE NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 

16521
08:50:50,118 --> 08:50:50,451
INTERACTION. 

16522
08:50:50,451 --> 08:50:52,320
BY BRINGING THIS UP, YOU ARE 

16523
08:50:52,320 --> 08:50:52,987
JUST DRAGGING HER THROUGH THE 

16524
08:50:52,987 --> 08:50:53,721
MUD. 

16525
08:50:53,721 --> 08:50:58,760
IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY. 

16526
08:50:58,760 --> 08:50:59,526
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

16527
08:50:59,526 --> 08:51:05,600
YOU'VE MADE REFERENCE, JUDGE, TO

16528
08:51:05,600 --> 08:51:06,768
A SWORN STATEMENT, I BELIEVE, 

16529
08:51:06,768 --> 08:51:08,069

SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INVESTIGATION

DESTROYED BY THE ACTIONS OF 

16588
08:53:08,990 --> 08:53:09,357

IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT OF FUN AND

I WANT TO GET INTO THIS WHOLE 

16653
08:55:20,554 --> 08:55:21,389
QUESTION THAT'S BEEN BANDIED 

16654

INVESTIGATION PROCESS. 

16657
08:55:26,326 --> 08:55:27,528
I THINK I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON 

16658
08:55:27,528 --> 08:55:28,695
WHAT SENATOR LEE AND SENATOR 

16659
08:55:28,695 --> 08:55:36,070
SASSE HAVE REFERENCE. 

16660
08:55:36,070 --> 08:55:37,138
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK 

16661
08:55:37,138 --> 08:55:38,238
ABOUT THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 

16662
08:55:38,238 --> 08:55:40,341
IN THESE PROCESSES, WHICH YOU 

16663
08:55:40,341 --> 08:55:41,742
HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHEN THE HAVE 

16664
08:55:41,742 --> 08:55:43,511

WITH REGARD TO A NOMINATION,

08:55:45,980 --> 08:55:47,615
COULD YOU QUICKLY DESCRIBE THAT 

16667
08:55:47,615 --> 08:55:47,949
FOR US? 

16668
08:55:47,949 --> 08:55:48,850
WHAT DOES THE FBI DO? 

16669
08:55:48,850 --> 08:55:54,989
>> THE FBI GATHERS STATEMENTS 

16670
08:55:54,989 --> 08:55:56,457
FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

16671
08:55:56,457 --> 08:55:57,158
INFORMATION. 

16672
08:55:57,158 --> 08:55:59,494
THEY DON'T RESOLVE CREDIBILITY. 

16673
08:55:59,494 --> 08:56:01,095
THEY GATHER THE INFORMATION AND 

16674
08:56:01,095 --> 08:56:02,863
THE CREDIBILITY DETERMINATION IS

16675
08:56:02,863 --> 08:56:03,898
MADE BY THE ALTERNATE 

16676
08:56:03,898 --> 08:56:04,198
FACTFINDER. 

16677
08:56:04,198 --> 08:56:05,566
IN THIS CASE, THE U.S. SENATE. 

16678
08:56:05,566 --> 08:56:06,834
THE COMMITTEE, OF COURSE, IS 

16679
08:56:06,834 --> 08:56:07,267
GATHERING EVIDENCE. 

16680
08:56:07,267 --> 08:56:13,174
>> THE FBI THEN GIVES THAT 

16681
08:56:13,174 --> 08:56:15,309
REPORT TO THE WHITE HOUSE, IF I 

16682
08:56:15,309 --> 08:56:17,545
UNDERSTAND IT AND THE WHITE 

16683
08:56:17,545 --> 08:56:19,680

16684
08:56:19,680 --> 08:56:20,047
SENATE. 

16685
08:56:20,047 --> 08:56:21,148
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. 

16686
08:56:21,148 --> 08:56:23,718
>> AS YOU INDICATED, IT DOES 

16687
08:56:23,718 --> 08:56:25,419
NOT -- IT'S BEEN SAID MANY 

16688
08:56:25,419 --> 08:56:28,422
TIMES -- THE FBI DOES NOT MAKE 

16689
08:56:28,422 --> 08:56:29,957
JUDGMENTS, IT GIVES THE SENATE 

16690
08:56:29,957 --> 08:56:30,924
COMMITTEE INFORMATION? 

16691
08:56:30,924 --> 08:56:33,127
>> AT THAT POINT IN TIME, IF I 

16692
08:56:33,127 --> 08:56:33,627
UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS 

16693
08:56:33,627 --> 08:56:38,366
CORRECTLY, THE U.S. SENATE 

16694
08:56:38,366 --> 08:56:40,167
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS LEGAL 

16695
08:56:40,167 --> 08:56:40,668
AUTHORITIES. 

16696
08:56:40,668 --> 08:56:42,570
IF IT RECEIVES INFORMATION IN 

16697
08:56:42,570 --> 08:56:45,106
THE FBI REPORT THAT IT WANTS TO 

16698
08:56:45,106 --> 08:56:47,008
FURTHER INVESTIGATE, THE SENATE 

16699
08:56:47,008 --> 08:56:48,676
HAS LEGAL AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT 

16700
08:56:48,676 --> 08:56:49,176
FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS. 

16701
08:56:49,176 --> 08:56:49,977
IS THAT CORRECT? 

16702
08:56:49,977 --> 08:56:51,412
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. 

16703
08:56:51,412 --> 08:56:54,181
>> THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN 

16704
08:56:54,181 --> 08:56:56,317
REFERENCED HERE MANY TIMES ABOUT

16705
08:56:56,317 --> 08:56:58,552
HOW SOME OF THESE WITNESSES 

16706
08:56:58,552 --> 08:57:00,821
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE 

16707
08:57:00,821 --> 08:57:02,490
VERY LATE INFORMATION THAT WE 

16708
08:57:02,490 --> 08:57:04,125
RECEIVED, HAVE MADE STATEMENTS 

16709
08:57:04,125 --> 08:57:05,192
THAT ARE UNDER PENALTY OF 

16710
08:57:05,192 --> 08:57:05,425
FELONY. 

16711
08:57:05,425 --> 08:57:06,427
THAT'S A FELONY FOR LYING TO 

16712
08:57:06,427 --> 08:57:11,032
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

16713
08:57:11,032 --> 08:57:13,134
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, WHAT 

16714
08:57:13,134 --> 08:57:15,036
HAPPENS IS THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

16715
08:57:15,036 --> 08:57:16,537
COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS AUTHORITY 

16716
08:57:16,537 --> 08:57:17,772
UNDER LAW TO CONDUCT THOSE 

16717
08:57:17,772 --> 08:57:19,173
KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS, FOLLOWS

16718
08:57:19,173 --> 08:57:21,909
UP ON THE FBI REPORTS TO FINISH 

16719
08:57:21,909 --> 08:57:23,811
OUT THE INVESTIGATION THAT IT 

16720
08:57:23,811 --> 08:57:25,079
WANTS WITH REGARD TO ANY 

16721
08:57:25,079 --> 08:57:26,447
INFORMATION THAT IT RECEIVES 

16722
08:57:26,447 --> 08:57:27,414
THAT NEEDS FURTHER 

16723
08:57:27,414 --> 08:57:27,781
INVESTIGATION. 

16724
08:57:27,781 --> 08:57:29,950
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF 

16725
08:57:29,950 --> 08:57:30,518
THE PROCESS? 

16726
08:57:30,518 --> 08:57:31,586
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING, 

16727
08:57:31,586 --> 08:57:31,852
SENATOR. 

16728
08:57:31,852 --> 08:57:33,421
>> IN THIS CASE, AND THERE'S 

16729
08:57:33,421 --> 08:57:35,056
BEEN A LOT OF TALK -- IT LOOKS 

16730
08:57:35,056 --> 08:57:36,657
LIKE I WILL RUN OUT OF TIME -- 

16731
08:57:36,657 --> 08:57:38,726
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE'S A LOT 

16732
08:57:38,726 --> 08:57:40,695
OF CONCERN BY MANY THAT THERE 

16733
08:57:40,695 --> 08:57:42,196
WAS NOT SO MUCH IN INTEREST IN 

16734
08:57:42,196 --> 08:57:43,564
THE FBI INVESTIGATION AS IT WAS 

16735
08:57:43,564 --> 08:57:44,165
IN DELAY. 

16736
08:57:44,165 --> 08:57:47,134
I'M NOT GOING TO GET TO THAT 

16737
08:57:47,134 --> 08:57:48,001
UNLESS I HAVE TIME. 

16738
08:57:48,001 --> 08:57:49,103
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT 

16739
08:57:49,103 --> 08:57:50,905
HAPPENED IN THE SENATE 

16740
08:57:50,905 --> 08:57:52,673
COMMITTEES WITH THE 

16741
08:57:52,673 --> 08:57:53,374
INVESTIGATION. 

16742
08:57:53,374 --> 08:57:55,876
AS I UNDERSTAND AND IT MAY BE 

16743
08:57:55,876 --> 08:57:57,511
MORE OF A QUESTION TO THE 

16744
08:57:57,511 --> 08:57:59,246
CHAIRMAN, AS SOON AS WE 

16745
08:57:59,246 --> 08:58:00,014
RECEIVED INFORMATION AT 45 DAYS 

16746
08:58:00,014 --> 08:58:01,515
AFTER OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE 

16747
08:58:01,515 --> 08:58:04,819
RECEIVED IT, WE CONDUCTED AN 

16748
08:58:04,819 --> 08:58:05,186
INVESTIGATION. 

16749
08:58:05,186 --> 08:58:05,952
IS THAT CORRECT, MR. CHAIRMAN? 

16750
08:58:05,952 --> 08:58:13,527
WE BEGAN THAT LEGAL SENATE 

16751
08:58:13,527 --> 08:58:14,095
JUDICIARY COMMITTED 

16752
08:58:14,095 --> 08:58:14,462
INVESTIGATION. 

16753
08:58:14,462 --> 08:58:15,096
>> THAT INVESTIGATION INVOLVED 

16754
08:58:15,096 --> 08:58:22,269
OUR FULLY, LAWFULLY ENABLED 

16755
08:58:22,269 --> 08:58:25,206
INVESTIGATORS TO CONDUCT AN 

16756
08:58:25,206 --> 08:58:25,673
INVESTIGATION. 

16757
08:58:25,673 --> 08:58:27,708
IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY, 

16758
08:58:27,708 --> 08:58:29,910
THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE 

16759
08:58:29,910 --> 08:58:30,878
COMMITTEE REFUSED TO 

16760
08:58:30,878 --> 08:58:31,745
PARTICIPATE IN THAT 

16761
08:58:31,745 --> 08:58:32,112
INVESTIGATION. 

16762
08:58:32,112 --> 08:58:32,980
>> YES. 

16763
08:58:32,980 --> 08:58:35,816
>> SO, WE HAVE CONDUCTED THE 

16764
08:58:35,816 --> 08:58:36,183
INVESTIGATION. 

16765
08:58:36,183 --> 08:58:37,318
THE VERY KINDS OF THINGS THAT 

16766
08:58:37,318 --> 08:58:39,019
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 

16767
08:58:39,019 --> 08:58:41,221
ARE ASKING THAT WE TELL THE FBI 

16768
08:58:41,221 --> 08:58:43,324
TO DO, THIS COMMITTEE HAS THE 

16769
08:58:43,324 --> 08:58:45,559
AUTHORITY TO DO IT AND THIS 

16770
08:58:45,559 --> 08:58:47,094
COMMITTEE DOES IT AND THIS 

16771
08:58:47,094 --> 08:58:49,630
COMMITTEE HAS DONE IT. 

16772
08:58:49,630 --> 08:58:51,565
THERE MAY BE MORE INTERVIEWS 

16773
08:58:51,565 --> 08:58:53,100
AND MORE INVESTIGATIONS, BUT 

16774
08:58:53,100 --> 08:58:54,034
WHEN YOU, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HAVE 

16775
08:58:54,034 --> 08:58:54,668
REFERENCED THE TESTIMONY THAT 

16776
08:58:54,668 --> 08:58:56,070
HAS COME FROM THOSE WHO ARE 

16777
08:58:56,070 --> 08:59:03,010
IDENTIFIED AS BEING AT THIS 

16778
08:59:03,010 --> 08:59:05,846
EVENT, THE TESTIMONY THAT HAS 

16779
08:59:05,846 --> 08:59:06,614
BEEN RECEIVED FROM THEM IS 

16780
08:59:06,614 --> 08:59:07,548
INFORMATION RECEIVED PURSUANT 

16781
08:59:07,548 --> 08:59:09,083
TO A SENATE COMMITTEE 

16782
08:59:09,083 --> 08:59:10,217
INVESTIGATION AND I JUST THINK 

16783
08:59:10,217 --> 08:59:11,918
IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR. 

16784
08:59:11,918 --> 08:59:13,354
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF BACK-

16785
08:59:13,354 --> 08:59:14,588
AND-FORTH THAT WE ARE GETTING 

16786
08:59:14,588 --> 08:59:16,590
INFORMATION OR LOOKING AT THIS 

16787
08:59:16,590 --> 08:59:18,826
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK INTO 

16788
08:59:18,826 --> 08:59:20,194
THE INVESTIGATION OR SEE WHAT 

16789
08:59:20,194 --> 08:59:20,461
HAPPENED. 

16790
08:59:20,461 --> 08:59:21,729
THE REALITY IS THAT THIS 

16791
08:59:21,729 --> 08:59:22,730
COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY AND 

16792
08:59:22,730 --> 08:59:24,464
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED EVERY 

16793
08:59:24,464 --> 08:59:25,433
WITNESS THAT HAS BEEN 

16794
08:59:25,433 --> 08:59:26,667
IDENTIFIED TO US AND WE HAVE 

16795
08:59:26,667 --> 08:59:27,267
STATEMENTS UNDER PENALTY OF 

16796
08:59:27,267 --> 08:59:29,804
FELONY FROM THEM. 

16797
08:59:29,804 --> 08:59:31,705
SO, I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE 

16798
08:59:31,705 --> 08:59:33,274
WITH THAT. I 

16799
08:59:33,274 --> 08:59:35,409
HAVE 45 SECONDS LEFT AND I WANT 

16800
08:59:35,409 --> 08:59:36,944
TO ASK ONE QUICK QUESTION. 

16801
08:59:36,944 --> 08:59:39,012
AGAIN, ON TIMING. 

16802
08:59:39,012 --> 08:59:40,414
YOU HAD A MEETING WITH SENATOR 

16803
08:59:40,414 --> 08:59:40,914
FEINSTEIN ON AUGUST 20. 

16804
08:59:40,914 --> 08:59:41,816
>> IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND 

16805
08:59:41,816 --> 08:59:43,017
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE 

16806
08:59:43,017 --> 08:59:43,250
DATE. 

16807
08:59:43,250 --> 08:59:51,025
WHAT WAS ESTABLISHED 

16808
08:59:51,191 --> 08:59:54,161
HELPED DR. FORD TO RETAIN THE 

16809
08:59:54,161 --> 08:59:56,330
LAW FIRM SOMETIME BETWEEN AUGUST

16810
08:59:56,330 --> 09:00:00,434
30th AND AUGUST 7. I JUST 

16811
09:00:00,434 --> 09:00:01,769
WANTED YOU TO CLARIFY ONE MORE 

16812
09:00:01,769 --> 09:00:02,069
TIME. 

16813
09:00:02,069 --> 09:00:07,508
YOU HAD TWO WEEKS OR MORE AND 

16814
09:00:07,508 --> 09:00:09,109
THE ISSUE WAS NOT RAISED WITH 

16815
09:00:09,109 --> 09:00:10,377
YOU. 

16816
09:00:10,377 --> 09:00:10,978
>> IN. 

16817
09:00:10,978 --> 09:00:11,979
MY TIME IS UP. 

16818
09:00:11,979 --> 09:00:13,781
>> WE WILL TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE 

16819
09:00:13,781 --> 09:00:26,794
BREAK NOW. 

16820
09:00:26,794 --> 09:00:30,030
>>-A BREAK IN THE CABINET 

16821
09:00:30,030 --> 09:00:31,732
HEARINGS RIGHT NOW. 

16822
09:00:31,732 --> 09:00:34,969
WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. 

16823
09:00:34,969 --> 09:00:37,371
WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO THE 

16824
09:00:37,371 --> 09:00:39,373
END OF THE EXTRAORDINARY DAY IN 

16825
09:00:39,373 --> 09:00:41,442
WASHINGTON AS THE QUESTIONS 

16826
09:00:41,442 --> 09:00:43,911
CONTINUE FROM BOTH REPUBLICAN 

16827
09:00:43,911 --> 09:00:46,414
AND DEMOCRATIC SENATORS. 

16828
09:00:46,414 --> 09:00:47,314
REINTRODUCING THE FOLKS WE HAVE 

16829
09:00:47,314 --> 09:00:51,819
WITH US RIGHT NOW. 

16830
09:00:51,819 --> 09:00:52,920
WE'RE HERE WITH JOHN DICKERSON. 

16831
09:00:52,920 --> 09:00:58,692
IT TO THE LEFT IS RICKY KLEEMAN.

16832
09:00:58,692 --> 09:01:05,633
AND ALSO ILLEGAL ANALYST IS 

16833
09:01:05,633 --> 09:01:07,034
COVERED THE SUPREME COURT FOR A 

16834
09:01:07,034 --> 09:01:07,735
LONG TIME. 

16835
09:01:07,735 --> 09:01:11,705
>> I THOUGHT THERE WAS AN 

16836
09:01:11,705 --> 09:01:13,040
INTERESTING A CHANGE WAS 

16837
09:01:13,040 --> 09:01:16,777
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, WHICH, TO 

16838
09:01:16,777 --> 09:01:18,012
JOHN'S POINT, THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

16839
09:01:18,012 --> 09:01:19,813
ASKING ABOUT TO THE YEARBOOK AND

16840
09:01:19,813 --> 09:01:21,715
WHAT YOU WROTE IN THE YEARBOOK 

16841
09:01:21,715 --> 09:01:22,650
AND YOUR DRINKING. 

16842
09:01:22,650 --> 09:01:23,851
WITHOUT SAYING WHY. 

16843
09:01:23,851 --> 09:01:28,989
WITHOUT SAYING THE CONTEXT FOR 

16844
09:01:28,989 --> 09:01:29,189
THAT. 

16845
09:01:29,189 --> 09:01:30,124
IF HE'S NOT BEING TRUTHFUL 

16846
09:01:30,124 --> 09:01:31,325
ABOUT THAT, WE WANT TO KNOW 

16847
09:01:31,325 --> 09:01:34,495
WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE WAS. 

16848
09:01:34,495 --> 09:01:35,596
SEE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO 

16849
09:01:35,596 --> 09:01:36,330
WOULD DO THIS? 

16850
09:01:36,330 --> 09:01:37,631
I THINK IT IS ODD THAT THE 

16851
09:01:37,631 --> 09:01:38,966
PERSON WHO MADE THE POINTS, OF 

16852
09:01:38,966 --> 09:01:39,967
COURSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING, TO 

16853
09:01:39,967 --> 09:01:40,801
HEAR SENATOR BLUMENTHAL SAY, IF 

16854
09:01:40,801 --> 09:01:42,303
YOU WERE TO LIVE AT ONE THING, 

16855
09:01:42,303 --> 09:01:43,604
IT SUGGESTS YOU WOULD LIE ABOUT 

16856
09:01:43,604 --> 09:01:44,204
A LOT OF THINGS. 

16857
09:01:44,204 --> 09:01:45,639
YOU CAN ADMIRE KAVANAUGH'S 

16858
09:01:45,639 --> 09:01:47,408
RESTRAINT  ASKING, HOW IS YOUR 

16859
09:01:47,408 --> 09:01:51,011
SERVICE IN VIETNAM? 

16860
09:01:51,011 --> 09:01:55,382
BECAUSE SENATOR BLUMENTHAL HAS 

16861
09:01:55,382 --> 09:01:56,684
NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY TRUTHFUL 

16862
09:01:56,684 --> 09:01:57,818
ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS IN HIS 

16863
09:01:57,818 --> 09:01:58,051
CAREER. 

16864
09:01:58,051 --> 09:02:01,188
IT WAS AN ODD MOMENT. 

16865
09:02:01,188 --> 09:02:02,523
THEY WERE DOING WHAT YOU SAID 

16866
09:02:02,523 --> 09:02:04,191
THEY NEEDED TO DO, PROBABLY NOT 

16867
09:02:04,191 --> 09:02:11,031
THE RIGHT SENATOR TO BE SAYING 

16868
09:02:11,031 --> 09:02:12,066
THAT IF YOU LIE ABOUT ONE 

16869
09:02:12,066 --> 09:02:13,300
THING, THEN YOU WILL LIE ABOUT 

16870
09:02:13,300 --> 09:02:14,301
EVERYTHING ELSE, SINCE YOU 

16871
09:02:14,301 --> 09:02:15,302
MISLED ON HIS SERVICE IN 

16872
09:02:15,302 --> 09:02:15,569
VIETNAM. 

16873
09:02:15,569 --> 09:02:16,904
>> IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD 

16874
09:02:16,904 --> 09:02:17,938
HEARD ANITA HILL BROUGHT UP. 

16875
09:02:17,938 --> 09:02:18,639
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL MENTIONED 

16876
09:02:18,639 --> 09:02:18,939
IT. 

16877
09:02:18,939 --> 09:02:21,575
>> DO YOU BELIEVE HIM? 

16878
09:02:21,575 --> 09:02:22,610
HE NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. 

16879
09:02:22,610 --> 09:02:23,911
I WAS STRUCK BY TWO THINGS, ONE 

16880
09:02:23,911 --> 09:02:24,645
WAS WHICH, BRETT KAVANAUGH 

16881
09:02:24,645 --> 09:02:27,982
COMING BACK IN AND AMENDING HIS 

16882
09:02:27,982 --> 09:02:28,682
PREVIOUS REMARKS, WHICH WAS 

16883
09:02:28,682 --> 09:02:32,152
SAYING TO SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, HE 

16884
09:02:32,152 --> 09:02:33,153
REPEATEDLY FIRED BACK AND SAID 

16885
09:02:33,153 --> 09:02:39,026
HAVE YOU EVER BLACKED OUT?  

16886
09:02:39,026 --> 09:02:40,294
SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF AN 

16887
09:02:40,294 --> 09:02:40,594
ALCOHOLIC. 

16888
09:02:40,594 --> 09:02:41,095
AS SHE DESCRIBED. 

16889
09:02:41,095 --> 09:02:42,229
SO HE APOLOGIZE FOR DOING THAT. 

16890
09:02:42,229 --> 09:02:44,965
THE OTHER THING IS ON THE FBI. 

16891
09:02:44,965 --> 09:02:46,700
WHEN HE GETS INTO A PROCESS 

16892
09:02:46,700 --> 09:02:49,003
FIGHT, YOU TEND TO LOSE PEOPLE. 

16893
09:02:49,003 --> 09:02:50,604
SELF REPUBLICANS IN THIS 

16894
09:02:50,604 --> 09:02:53,874
AFTERNOON CAN TALK ABOUT AN 

16895
09:02:53,874 --> 09:02:54,508
AGGRIEVED BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO 

16896
09:02:54,508 --> 09:02:56,877
HAS HAD HIS FAMILY BROUGHT 

16897
09:02:56,877 --> 09:03:02,316
THROUGH THIS AWFUL PROCESS, 

16898
09:03:02,316 --> 09:03:03,617
THAT IS THE MORAL AND EMOTIONAL 

16899
09:03:03,617 --> 09:03:04,985
ARGUMENT TO RALLY SUPPORTERS. 

16900
09:03:04,985 --> 09:03:10,991
THE FBI ARGUMENT IS IN THE 

16901
09:03:10,991 --> 09:03:11,792
WEEDS A LITTLE BIT. 

16902
09:03:11,792 --> 09:03:13,327
AS YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THIS 

16903
09:03:13,327 --> 09:03:14,428
WILL PLAY OUT IN PUBLIC, WHICH 

16904
09:03:14,428 --> 09:03:15,663
IS WHERE THIS IS BEING PLAYED, 

16905
09:03:15,663 --> 09:03:16,696
I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS 

16906
09:03:16,696 --> 09:03:18,298
ARE HAPPY TO DEBATE THE FBI ALL 

16907
09:03:18,298 --> 09:03:18,598
DAY LONG. 

16908
09:03:18,598 --> 09:03:20,300
BECAUSE, AT THE END OF THE DAY, 

16909
09:03:20,300 --> 09:03:22,236
PEOPLE CAN'T QUITE FOLLOW IT. 

16910
09:03:22,236 --> 09:03:27,207
THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW. 

16911
09:03:27,207 --> 09:03:29,009
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS 

16912
09:03:29,009 --> 09:03:29,743
A POLITICAL CONVERSATION WHERE 

16913
09:03:29,743 --> 09:03:30,444
PEOPLE HAVE TO DEFEND 

16914
09:03:30,444 --> 09:03:32,079
THEMSELVES IN THE POLITICAL 

16915
09:03:32,079 --> 09:03:32,346
CONTEXT. 

16916
09:03:32,346 --> 09:03:33,714
SO I THINK THAT IS HOW THE FBI 

16917
09:03:33,714 --> 09:03:34,648
THING MIGHT WORK OUT. 

16918
09:03:34,648 --> 09:03:37,651
>> REIT -- RICKY, LEGALLY 

16919
09:03:37,651 --> 09:03:38,919
SPEAKING, WHAT HAS SURPRISED 

16920
09:03:38,919 --> 09:03:42,056
MOST ABOUT TODAY, OR FROM WHAT 

16921
09:03:42,056 --> 09:03:42,523
WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY? 

16922
09:03:42,523 --> 09:03:43,891
>> I THINK WHAT SURPRISED ME 

16923
09:03:43,891 --> 09:03:45,960
WAS, I EXPECTED THE DEMOCRATS 

16924
09:03:45,960 --> 09:03:48,762
TO HAVE HAD NUMEROUS 

16925
09:03:48,762 --> 09:03:51,799
CONVERSATIONS AMONGST THEMSELVES

16926
09:03:51,799 --> 09:03:53,133
, THE SENATORS, AND TO HAVE HAD 

16927
09:03:53,133 --> 09:03:55,402
AN AGREED-UPON PLAN THAT, WHERE 

16928
09:03:55,402 --> 09:03:57,338
ONE SENATOR COULD BUILD UPON 

16929
09:03:57,338 --> 09:03:59,907
ANOTHER AND BUILD UPON ANOTHER. 

16930
09:03:59,907 --> 09:04:03,243
I KNOW IT IS NOT A COURT OF LAW,

16931
09:04:03,243 --> 09:04:04,878
BUT THE THEMES STILL RING TRUE. 

16932
09:04:04,878 --> 09:04:09,350
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS

16933
09:04:09,350 --> 09:04:10,751
WOULD SAY WHEN TRYING TO CASE, 

16934
09:04:10,751 --> 09:04:11,885
DID NOT MATTER WHICH SIDE, IS 

16935
09:04:11,885 --> 09:04:12,886
WHAT IS YOUR STORY? 

16936
09:04:12,886 --> 09:04:16,590
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STORY THAT 

16937
09:04:16,590 --> 09:04:18,025
HAS A BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND AN 

16938
09:04:18,025 --> 09:04:18,759
END. 

16939
09:04:18,759 --> 09:04:20,661
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS THAT THE 

16940
09:04:20,661 --> 09:04:22,129
REPUBLICANS HAVE A STORY. 

16941
09:04:22,129 --> 09:04:25,131
IT IS ABOUT THE DEMISE OF THE 

16942
09:04:25,131 --> 09:04:27,968
CHARACTER, OR THE ATTEMPTED 

16943
09:04:27,968 --> 09:04:29,203
DEMISE OF THE CHARACTER, OF 

16944
09:04:29,203 --> 09:04:30,571
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY. 

16945
09:04:30,571 --> 09:04:35,008
AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THEY 

16946
09:04:35,008 --> 09:04:37,077
SHOW EMPATHY IS A STORY, WITH 

16947
09:04:37,077 --> 09:04:38,078
THE BELIEF THAT SOMETHING 

16948
09:04:38,078 --> 09:04:40,414
TERRIBLE HAPPENED TO DR. FORD, 

16949
09:04:40,414 --> 09:04:42,750
BUT IT JUST WASN'T BRETT 

16950
09:04:42,750 --> 09:04:43,150
KAVANAUGH. 

16951
09:04:43,150 --> 09:04:44,784
THE DEMOCRATS, TO FOLLOW UP ON 

16952
09:04:44,784 --> 09:04:46,520
JOHN, THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT HAVE 

16953
09:04:46,520 --> 09:04:47,121
A STORY HERE. 

16954
09:04:47,121 --> 09:04:49,390
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD. 

16955
09:04:49,390 --> 09:04:51,024
WHAT THEY HAVE IS BEATING THIS 

16956
09:04:51,024 --> 09:04:53,360
DRUM OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 

16957
09:04:53,360 --> 09:04:55,595
OCCASIONALLY GOING BACK TO THE 

16958
09:04:55,595 --> 09:04:58,432
YEARBOOK OR TO STATEMENTS FROM 

16959
09:04:58,432 --> 09:05:00,500
COLLEGE TO TRY TO SHOW THAT 

16960
09:05:00,500 --> 09:05:04,938
PERHAPS, BRICK AVENUE -- BRETT 

16961
09:05:04,938 --> 09:05:08,642
KAVANAUGH IS LYING. 

16962
09:05:08,642 --> 09:05:09,376
THEY HAVE A STORY, THEY'RE JUST 

16963
09:05:09,376 --> 09:05:09,977
NOT TELLING IT. 

16964
09:05:09,977 --> 09:05:13,413
THE MANNER OF PERSUASION, 

16965
09:05:13,413 --> 09:05:14,848
WHETHER IT IS TO THE JURY OR 

16966
09:05:14,848 --> 09:05:16,549
THE PUBLIC, IS THAT THE PUBLIC 

16967
09:05:16,549 --> 09:05:18,519
MUST RUN WITH YOUR STORY. 

16968
09:05:18,519 --> 09:05:20,921
IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE IN THE 

16969
09:05:20,921 --> 09:05:21,388
WEEDS. 

16970
09:05:21,388 --> 09:05:22,623
WHAT BOTH SIDES HAVE TO BE 

16971
09:05:22,623 --> 09:05:24,124
CAUTIOUS ABOUT IS GOING BACK TO 

16972
09:05:24,124 --> 09:05:25,793
HIS CHILDHOOD OR TO HIS TEEN 

16973
09:05:25,793 --> 09:05:26,460
YEARS IN COLLEGE. 

16974
09:05:26,460 --> 09:05:29,263
YOU SELL REPUBLICANS, LIKE 

16975
09:05:29,263 --> 09:05:32,966
SENATOR HATCH, SAY THAT I 

16976
09:05:32,966 --> 09:05:33,567
CANNOT BELIEVE WE ARE 

16977
09:05:33,567 --> 09:05:34,268
RELITIGATING THINGS THAT 

16978
09:05:34,268 --> 09:05:38,605
HAPPENED WHEN YOU ARE 16. 

16979
09:05:38,605 --> 09:05:40,240
NOT TO SAY THAT THIS WAS NOT A 

16980
09:05:40,240 --> 09:05:41,241
SERIOUS ALLEGATION AND IF TRUE, 

16981
09:05:41,241 --> 09:05:42,376
OF COURSE, HE SHOULD NOT BE 

16982
09:05:42,376 --> 09:05:43,844
CONFIRMED, SO, THEY ARE 

16983
09:05:43,844 --> 09:05:45,512
JUGGLING THE ACCUSATION AND THE 

16984
09:05:45,512 --> 09:05:48,782
AGE OF THE ACCUSED. 

16985
09:05:48,782 --> 09:05:49,983
ON THE FLIPSIDE, YOU CAN SEE 

16986
09:05:49,983 --> 09:05:50,617
WHERE DEMOCRATS BRING UP 

16987
09:05:50,617 --> 09:05:52,553
CERTAIN INCIDENTS OR YEARBOOK 

16988
09:05:52,553 --> 09:05:59,026
CAPTIONS AND BRING UP PEOPLE 

16989
09:05:59,026 --> 09:05:59,960
THAT ARE DISPARAGED, MAYBE, IN 

16990
09:05:59,960 --> 09:06:01,628
THE YEARBOOK AND YOU SEE JUDGE 

16991
09:06:01,628 --> 09:06:05,899
KAVANAUGH FLIP THINGS AROUND 

16992
09:06:05,899 --> 09:06:06,934
AND SAY, I DON'T WANT TO DRAG 

16993
09:06:06,934 --> 09:06:08,101
THIS PERSON'S NAME BACK IN THE 

16994
09:06:08,101 --> 09:06:09,403
MUD, WHY ARE YOU BRINGING HER 

16995
09:06:09,403 --> 09:06:09,903
UP RIGHT NOW? 

16996
09:06:09,903 --> 09:06:10,703
YOU DIDN'T SEE SENATOR 

16997
09:06:10,703 --> 00:00:00,000
BLUMENTHAL COME BACK WITH
