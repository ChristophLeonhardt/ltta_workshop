the mark of a good leader is somebody
who is able to empower other people so
often we think of leadership as somebody
at the top who is ordering other people
around but it turns out that for me at
least what made me understand leadership
was when I could see somebody who
thought they didn't have a voice thought
they didn't have influence or didn't
have power and teach them how they could
speak up on the things that were
affecting their lives right people have
a tendency to blame politicians when
things don't work but as I always tell
people you get the politicians you
deserve and if you don't vote and you
don't participate and you don't pay
attention then you'll get policies that
don't reflect your interest okay
