so the 10-year yield went through an important threshold get 3% and stocks didn't respond that great what do you think about that so I think people you know that the benchmark 10-year the 3 percent that people are looking at there's a lot of focus on I think it's a big deal but I think it's a big deal that yields are moving higher actually think the front end of the yield curve has become an alternative you know the front end a two-year now at 250 it's creating an alternative it used to be nice I got to buy utility stocks I've got to buy preferred stocks I get actually I can do really well sitting in the front and not taking a lot of risk you know it used to be my cash is getting zero or my front end now it's changing the paradigm going through 3% is a big deal I don't think we're going that much higher I think we'll go you know we've said three and a quarter maybe three and a half this year but you know yields are moving higher I think people have to have to respect that and you do want equities do you own debt that becomes a more attractive instrument and when you're and you're more excited about the front end can you talk more about your thesis there yeah I mean it's an amazing thing we are now creating a dynamic so it's people talk about the issuance and how much treasure eternities got issue and what they did last was almost 300 billion worth of bills it's too much the market can't absorb that much what's happening is not only they're issuing a tremendous amount but it has real yield to it so what's happening now is not only as the Treasury issuing this a massive amount of debt but it's got an income it was one thing when they were issuing Treasury bills at zero for years like it's not that in now my gosh I can get bills at close to 2% or maybe even a bit behind that it's really powerful and you've changed the whole investment paradigm when you when you construct a portfolio or if you're an investor and it used to be my god how am I gonna get any income on portfolio well now I've got an easy way to do it without any risk that is a big deal and how does that compare to equities or other yes what's happened now is you take the dividend yield of stocks and you look at where it was in the dividend yield the Sox was really attractive relative Treasuries were but for years that was in the case now all of a sudden you know things like utilities are things like there all of a sudden you're compressing that by the way doesn't mean people send own equities we think we think equities probably will go higher from here but but the need to get more in your portfolio by the way you're getting close to the end of a business cycle I know we think equities still have some more upside but what's happened is you've changed the investment regime quite a bit and I think that's said that is such a big deal and I know what I just don't think people don't talk about the front end of the curve and the front end is where you know we look at our portfolios like gosh I could buy commercial paper I could buy some front and ass all of a sudden I could do well with that and what about inflation when you're watching the Fed are you worried about inflation so you know I would say it was a you know we think inflation is going higher but we're in a completely different regime than anything anybody's ever seen before in history do I think we think CPI core CPI is gonna compete at about two and a half percent maybe a little above that core PCE which is a feds favorite metric it'll be out to two but you think about the growth that we have in the economy today and where wages are accelerating historically you would see numbers dramatically higher listen we've spent so no I'm not I worried about inflation getting excited about technology this incredible headwind keeping inflation down every time you think inflation is going to go higher you see another development and transportation or energy or food that just presses down on it listen and you go back years anything about if you've got this sort of growth this sort of wage acceleration the rate of inflation will be much higher and we've spent the Fed has spent no time the economy spend no time above 2% in the last six years the feds not that not that scared not that nervous about gosh if we get to two or two three who cares I mean it's not that big a deal so they'll just keep going on they're moving three to four times this year three to four times next year no reason to speed it up which I've said publicly which is part of why in the front end of the curve if they're not gonna speed it up much of its gotten priced into the market well we feel pretty good about that it's just not that scary inflation and you know people look at history and it's look at the traditional economic models and said this sort of growth this sort of wage you know four percent unemployment rate my god you're gonna see this sort of inflation just not like history and given the shift in technology and where you see inflation going or how things have changed is 2 percent the right inflation target for the Fed and where did that come from originally yeah it's just not I mean so is inflation the right metric over 50 years definitely and is inflation over a long term there is to get companies to have some pricing power in inflation expectations and belief that if you invest that you'll get some appreciation from inflation but if you think about the revenue you know what I think is the greatest revolution of all time and technology that it's not the technology traditionally we think about whether it's lighting or automobiles or transport you know things like rail etc what it did is it created this incredible growth engine the technology today is designed to do what we used to do in a fraction of the costs you think about autonomous driving you think about how we produce food you think about how we how we produce energy today about horizontal fracking everything we used to do is an app on your phone that you used to do the same thing at a fraction of the cost meaning why is 2% there's any magic to 2% in Europe you can't get above one in environment where their growth has been well above potential meaning I just don't think and it's a part of why I don't think you know the Fed it would be that worked up if we got a little above two because you gonna come back down to particularly the economy slow you'll get back under two so you know what is the right target you know why can't if growth if you get real growth in the economy and you grow at one-and-a-half percent particularly if bad inflation is coming down what is bad inflation particularly thing about lower and middle income if it's food if it's energy if it's apparel if those things are coming down it not only is it not but is that not good it actually helps the quantity of goods it helps net disposable income for people so you can consume more in your quality of life is better so your this target of you know I do a lot of work in urban education other ways and we talked a lot about inflation then we tell you what people don't want higher inflation but give me something that's stable so their investment comes in and the bad inflation comes down and how do all of these things play into what's your outlook for the market for stock yeah so I think Justin I think equities you know the the era of where connect Woody's go you get to get these supercharged returns I think it's finished we're getting closer to the end of the business cycle you know I don't think I look at free cash flow yields free cash flow companies thrown off a lot of free cash flow there's still I look at where you cost the cost of Finance if your company do finance it there was an incredible orbit charge of coming to buy back huge amounts of stock not that great today but can you get an eight to ten percent return this year in equities I think so and I and I definitely think you do that particularly opposed to tax bill but I think what people to think about you know how do I get in this era in 2018 they have to bring down their return expectations boy if I can get eight to ten percent in equities if I can carry in fixed income and there ways I can get two to three percent Stinkum that i could throw off a mid-single did you return life is good and I think that's the world we're living and we're gonna get 25% inequities anymore but I think companies are there you know you look at the earnings numbers the RO E's they're throwing off their pretty impressive and the free cash flow that the throw off and they're still buying back some stock but I just think the world is different will be different in 18 and will be different in 19 you know try and hit a mid-single digit return and and what's the most efficient way to get there and finally was there anything that keeps you up at night is there anything you're worried about for a fixed income portfolio or an equity portfolio so I don't sleep much at night so that's a hard thing to start with but the yeah I think the listen I mean the biggest risk in the word in the world continues to be you know Chinese you know how does China Grove China's 42 percent of growth in the world today in this trade discussion around how it works out with China is a bigger deal when people give credit to because they are literally 50 percent of the demand in the world for commodities iron or nickel aluminum zinc so we you know the extent that China's growing the global economy and trade is working it's a very big deal so that that is something that I think and it feels like that momentum is moving to a better place so below you in terms of the trade anyway that's one listen I think the world has gotten short volatility for a long time and that could be in different expressions you know how do I get income in our portfolio I'll use I'll use bait I'll use some of the high-yield market I'll use short volatility I'll create leverage in my portfolio through margin etc you know some of that there's extreme volatility of seeming any this year is some of that's getting wrung out more of that has to get wrung out so how that transpires we're gonna live 2018 is gonna be higher volatility no doubt no doubt and it's what's happening now is the Fed is training liquidity from the system and the Treasury's issuing tremendous amount so they're also taking a liquid system that means volatility is gonna be higher so now how do you operate effectively how do you build a portfolio you know that with the things with things that keep you up at night but are but give you a less volatility where will be a higher volatility environment
