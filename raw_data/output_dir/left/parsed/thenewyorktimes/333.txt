“I started gymnastics in 1976.
I loved it.
And I had a certain
aptitude for it.
I was a national team
member for eight years.
And I was a national
champion in 1986.
I think it’s dangerous
to assume that we
have a one guy problem with
Nassar and that with him gone,
the sport is now safe,
and these girls are now safe.”
More than 250 women
have come forward
to say they were sexually abused
by former U.S.A. Gymnastics doctor
Larry Nassar.
The scandal has highlighted
what many gymnasts
say is a culture of
abuse within U.S.A.G.
“The standard and the
expectation if you want to win
is an environment that
is rife with physical
and emotional abuse.
And I think this creates
the conditions where
sexual abuse can occur.”
U.S.A. Gymnastics has complaint
files on 54 coaches
from 1996 to 2006, according
to documents obtained
by The Indianapolis
Star.
For decades, U.S.A.G.
empowered itself
to investigate complaints
before deciding whether
to contact law enforcement.
Former U.S.A.G. president 
Steve Penny once said in a deposition:
“To the best of my
knowledge, there
is no duty to report if you are a
third party to some allegation.”
These gymnastics coaches
were accused of sexual abuse.
Here’s how U.S.A. Gymnastics
handled their cases.
Don Peters led the
U.S. women’s team
to a record breaking eight
medals at the 1984 Olympics.
“The head coach of the
American women’s team
is Don Peters, one of the most
respected men in gymnastics.”
In 2011, three gymnasts told The
Orange County Register
that Peters had
sex with them when
they were teenagers in the '80s.
Peters was banned for
life by U.S.A. Gymnastics
two months after the
report was published.
He was also removed from
the Sports Hall of Fame.
Marvin Sharpe was the
U.S.A. Gymnastics 2010
coach of the year.
U.S.A.G. got a detailed account of
abuse involving Sharp in 2011,
but it wasn’t
until a 14-year-old
came forward in 2015 that the
federation contacted police.
Sharpe was arrested
in August 2015
and committed suicide in his
jail cell one month later.
Stephen Infante was a popular
coach in New England gymnastics.
In 1997, gymnasts accused Infante
of having sex with them when
they were teenagers.
After an internal investigation
U.S.A. Gymnastics barred
Infante for life,
but the organization
didn't go to the police,
and Infante continued coaching
girls at gymnastics summer camps.
Infante was charged with raping
one of his former athletes
a decade later and
was convicted in 2010.
Last year, a nonprofit called
the U.S. Center for SafeSport
was put in charge of
preventing and handling abuse
in Olympic sports,
and in the wake
of the Nassar scandal
the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board
has been forced to resign.
Many athletes and
victims of abuse
say these actions are
too little, too late.
And some wonder if
it’s truly enough
to transform a
culture that failed
to protect its young women.
