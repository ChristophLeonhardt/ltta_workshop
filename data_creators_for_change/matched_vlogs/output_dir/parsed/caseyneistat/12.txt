11:12 p.m. on a Saturday night I am I am
I'm driving from New York City to
Philadelphia Pennsylvania right now all
by myself
I'm here for like 12 hours and I'm here
for one reason only
thank you I'm here just tomorrow morning
at 7 a.m. is the Philadelphia Marathon
and I'm only gonna run the half marathon
but I just kind of have this itch to do
a race and well I love Philadelphia and
Here I am
five five and a half hours of sleep then
on the half marathon
right it's just after 6:00 a.m. I got to
get downstairs meet like them organizers
that give me the number for the race but
it's morning time it's go time
all right this is it the race starts in
like seven minutes or no
seven twenty twenty two minutes I'm
feeling good I'm not trying to break any
records today I'm not trying to do a
personal best
my goal is to do like an hour and thirty
minutes which would be great but I want
just a nice good race
I haven't raced in so long I'm
definitely like a little bit nervous and
weird but I'm super excited
we're in route to the starting line now
this is chris chris is the one who made
to hook this up other I didn't have a
bib
yesterday I tweeted at him he's an
ambassador for the say Western I know
from New York
first my Lindsay
we
but Jesus way the bells were ringing out
Christmas Day ha ha
one more mile one more
alright 128 piece of cake look to me
we
you know I almost didn't run today
because what a pain in the ass coming
all the way to Philadelphia is but but
I'm glad I did and when I was out there
is reminded of what makes running such a
special sport in racing such a great
part of that sport see I wanted to run a
130 today and I ran a 128 which means I
did it I won and that that's the magic
of running races that you're only ever
competing with yourself all that matters
is that how did you do how did your
results compare with your goals well as
your time I don't know like 210 what is
your goal on 210 all right yep yep can I
yeah so the whole time I'm running that
race whether I'm like passing some dude
or this grill
burning by me I'm just looking at all
these people and I'm thinking to myself
champions they're all champions so if
you've ever considered running or ever
considered racing know that no one gives
us how you fare compared to everybody
else all that really matters is how did
you do compared to what you wanted to do
so that feels for me that's that's a
special thing
don't you
