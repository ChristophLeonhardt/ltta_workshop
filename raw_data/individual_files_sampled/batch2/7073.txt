Ross after a judge rejected attempts to prevent the case from going to trial just days before the jury selections the two sides agreed to settle so if you're not a lawyer I could decipher that last part for you they're like shit Your Honor this is a personal vendetta I mean I took his money and reallocate it into my bank account but we shouldn't let this trial go forward just like now this trial is going forward and it's going to a jury because they've got plenty of evidence so right before they hook the jury or in the trial Wilbur Ross answers like a good fight like we did it come on let's just settle okay I mean look guy we stole 4 million what do you need back 2 million 3 million so it's not clear exactly how much they returned to mr. store per and it's not a guy that I particularly care about you decided to go into business with an incredibly shady guy like Wilbur Ross but it gives you a sense of how little there is honor among thieves so that is amazing you rip off your clients that's terrible but unfortunately a lot of people do that on Wall Street Europe off the average American that's just standard practice unfortunate in not an all Wall Street but in big parts of Wall Street but your own co-workers like oh hey where's my salary Wilbur oh I reallocated it where to my salary what what oh and it's not the only time he did it I've got more it's actually Dan Alexander writing in Forbes magazine great story he says what makes it all the more than a typical he says she said a dispute is the number of similar complaints against Ross a third former WL Ross employee Joseph Mullin father three point six million dollar lawsuit in December 2016 saying WL Ross funds quote looted his interest quote for the personal benefit of Wilbur L Ross jr. an attempt attempted to conceal their misconduct through opaque and misleading tax statements and disclosures and there was another guy in there as well but that's three different guys who were like he just stole my money and other guys like well while we were working together he looted my money so your meeting to get a sense of how Wilbur Ross does business and guys like Wilbur Ross by the way don't settle cases if they didn't do it now other people might want to make stuff go away and settlements happen and maybe they happen for lower numbers that's all normal right millions of dollars in settlements for a guys like Wilbur Ross who's looking to reallocate funds etc he's gonna reallocate him back if he didn't do it that's my personal opinion all right store burn two other for harm a former high-ranking executives at WL Ross filed yet another lawsuit against the Commerce Secretary in November alleging that he and his firm charged at least 48 million of improper fees then pocketed the money it was a slow sifting rather than a one-time heist according to the lawsuit so other executives of the company are like oh yeah if you thought it was bad what he was doing to his coworkers wait till you get a load of what he was doing those clients that's a 48 million dollar lawsuit so look and it's true from time to time there are lawsuits that are don't have any merit and it it happens right but one after another after another after another after another they're all saying the same thing looted stole stole from clients stole from co-workers they go to trial or they're about to go to trial he says are they / right here didn't take millions of dollars and unfortunately this is what Donald Trump this is what Wilbur Ross that does they steal so much money and then you have to sue them and they give you a portion of the stolen money back in settlements and at the end of the day they got away with it and and and they got more than they you know had to give back God that is so maddening the injustice of it and then they go around bragging about how rich they are and the rest of society treats them like well that was I think it was so Wilbur Ross you're a Wall Street genius you know how to rob people for a living genius mr. Ross mr. Ross and he's now a cabinet secretary he's supposed to be representing us do you now what do you think Wilbur Ross is representing right now is commissary Commerce Secretary you think he's representing you and looking out for your best interests this guy I'm not even done with him yet hold then there are the smaller anecdotal stories that give you a sense of his character and then we'll end on a couple of big ones and in Forbes talk to dozens of people that know Ross one says workers at his house in the Hamptons used to call to office claiming Ross had not paid them for their work and other two people said Ross once plays a million dollars to a charity then never paid mmm is that sound like that sounds like his boss Donald Trump look you got a house in the Hamptons a lot of people you know now like to mischaracterize progressives and so you do what you don't want anybody to have a house in the Hamptons have your house in the Hamptons just pay your workers that's crazy woody you have enough to have a house in the Hamptons and then your workers after working for an honest day's work or doing an honest day's work have to go and beg for their money because you wouldn't pay them Jesus Christ man okay then there are bigger allegations as Alexander explains over several months in speaking with 21 people who know Ross Forbes uncovered a pattern many of those who work directly with him claim that Ross wrongly siphoned or outright stole a few million here and a few million they're huge amounts for most but not necessarily for the Commerce Secretary at least if you consider them individually but all told these allegations which sparked lawsuits reimbursements and an SEC fine come to more than 120 million dollars well if you stole 120 million dollars you'd also be rich and then you'd be considered a Wall Street genius and then you might be a cabinet secretary now oh all those lawsuits right yeah you know hard to know are all the numbers right hard to know of course and most of the time we don't get to find out because if it went all the way through to trial he'd probably lose and somebody at some point should actually take some sort of action to stop guys like this from stealing on a regular basis because apparently just giving some portion of the proceeds back is not a good enough disincentive I don't know if there's anything they could be on criminal charges but it doesn't matter they run the government now so you know the singham of the inmates running the asylum well the robbers are running the bank basically and unfortunately it's it's our bank it's the United States government it's taxpayer funds they now control and God knows what they're doing the loot that so these are big big numbers that he's accused of ripping off so his lawyers and himself in a statement said they said something rather bizarre they said the SEC has never initiated any enforcement against action against me Ross said in a statement failing to mention the 2.3 million dollar fine it levied against his firm in 2016 I don't know if he's being cute and saying well technically it wasn't me it was the firm I was running the one that was named after me the one I was in charge of but either way it's not cute and it's not just allegations by other people where you can't be sure exactly if they're telling the truth or not it's the SEC and the SEC is not going around trying to pick on rich people for a personal event there's nothing personal there's no vendetta's there's no nothing okay if you paid a 2.3 million dollar fine and you agreed to pay that fine against the SEC trust me brother you did it roughly two months before the 2016 presidential election the SEC announced WL Ross was paying a fine and refunding eleven point nine million dollars it allegedly skimmed from its investors including interest Wilbur Ross is not the kind of guy to pay back twelve million dollars and then pay 2.3 million dollar fine on top if he didn't do it so this is our Commerce Secretary this is the Trump administration what was that about draining the swamp all right so now we go from the Republicans and the usual tremendous disappointment with them to the usual tremendous point with Democrats hey good news everybody a couple months ago the DNC said we are not taking any more money from fossil fuel companies terrific okay so and just when people thought the DNC didn't have any principles and done it and and weren't really progressives no they're standing ups these guys lead to climate change it is it's terrible for our environment it's terrible for our health and the DNC has morals and principles oh I'm sorry I'm getting word that they have changed their mind yeah kind of knew that before the story started we're having fun having fun with disastrous story so guess what happened at the end of last week there was a new resolution the resolution introduced by DNC chair Tom Perez states that the party supports fossil fuel workers hilarious and will accept donations from employers political action committees wait I thought you were all of a sudden concerned about the fossil fuel employees so if you said hey and there was a proposal by the way you work at a fossil fuel company you're Americans like everybody else you got no right to donate and and you care about this country no problem you know and how about you know letting them donate as employees up to $200 okay to show their personal interests in a in the Democratic Party or particular candidates that makes sense that proposal was defeated instead what they're going to do is to help the workers they're going to take money from their employers that's not helping the workers that's taking money from the companies themselves so that you will serve those companies let's call it what it is I got more details so this is their explanation the dancies the new resolution not to quote forward-looking employers so I'm sure that our quote powering America's all-of-the-above energy economy and moving us towards a future fueled by clean and low emissions energy technology from renewables to carbon capture and storage to advanced nuclear technology yeah in other words yeah we're taking money from the fossil fuel companies that's what we decided to do but don't worry the DNC assures you as they have a year after year oh no when we take millions of dollars from fossil fuel companies we will not serve them we'll just take their money and then actually fight for climate change we'll see that in the story of Democrats have actually done that but I don't need to explain it to you doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican or an independent you already know how this story ends you know it as a big picture you know the only people in the world who believe that politicians take money from giant corporations and do not do what those corporations say are the people who are on television or who work in Washington all of the rest of us know that that's total and utter horse crap that it's bribes and yes you work for them just admit it I know they won't and they'll say how dare you the Democrats who take bribes there's so much more honest than the Republicans who take bribes no they're just Dumber as I'll explain the facts behind that in a second as well so a DNC spokeswoman said that the resolution came in response to concerns from labor that the original fossil fuel donations ban was quote an attack on workers get the hell out of here and attack on workers I mean look I was gonna take money from ExxonMobil and I want to because I don't want to attack their workers no you just want to take bribes from ExxonMobil just say it you're patronizing language here is so annoying you think we're stupid look I look I'll grant you that it probably does work because the mainstream media will largely write it as like oh they are concerned about the workers that's what they said that's all I'm a stenographer that's what they say they work and serve other workers please now is labor concerns of the unions from those industries also want to give money to the DNC probably yes and is the DNC also affected by that and maybe even more affected by that maybe so is there a labor and union angle here yes is that smart way of conducting politics no no like I said numbers in a second but so what an activist thing because if it's a good-hearted effort and and they're actually trying to help the workers but the people who care about climate change will they'll come out and say now I don't you miss reading it it's really not that bad no they're furious I can give you a lot of quotes I'll just give you one tweet here from Kate Aaron off she said to put a fine point on it this proposal is it to let Union members keep donating to the DNC it's to let fossil fuel executives keep donating and selling influence among Democrats certain unions including Building Trades see their interest as aligned with those of executives and that is exactly what is wrong with the Union strategy as well as the Democratic Party strategy a lot of the unions are in favor of money in politics because they're like well we get we give money to conserves asked me all the time whether it's you know an organization like Wolfpack that wants to get money out of politics wolf dash pack.com we say it's non partisan then I go really would you take to you your money out yes yes yes we would definitely take the Union money out of politics we would also take the corporate money out of politics we would take all private financing of Elections out of politics because otherwise they work for private interests and I don't care much if it's the unions or corporations I don't want anyone bribing our politicians and in this case it's both so let's examine now the numbers that I promised you on whether this is a good strategy or not visa vie the Republican Party and by the way Alexander Kaufman writing a very good piece here up in Huff Post that I'm quoting he writes only gas companies spent a record seven point six million dollars on democratic races in 2016 well I'm sure they wanted nothing in return anyway but let's keep going let's see if that's a good strategy that's a pittance compared to the fifty three point seven million dollars in direct donations to Republicans who received eighty eight percent of the industry's contributions during that election cycle Republicans have taken in eighty nine percent of the industry's donations so far in 2018 that figure rises to 95 percent of the coal sectors largesse this year so what do you think the oil companies are paying the Democrats for it's obvious that they like the Republicans more because the Republicans deregulate them more that cut their taxes they let them get away with endangering their workers they love the Republican Party so why bother giving 12 percent of the demo so that you could buy their pathetic compliance be a good boy okay Democratic Party sit down and shut up and let the Republicans do whatever they want and then do your job go on a press conference and say oh there was nothing we could do oh my god I mean I happen to take millions of dollars from the fossil fuel companies I haven't only take 12 percent because I'm an idiot and I happen to be a loser and I'm paid to be a loser but when the Republicans said that the fossil fuel companies can do whatever they want ecology there was nothing I could do they are the Washington Generals to the Republicans Harlem Globetrotters in corruption by the way if you're a Republican what are you celebrating if you're a Republican vote are you celebrating that the Republicans have won the corruption game that they're more corrupt no the Republican Party is loathsome they're vomitus but we already know their corruption I don't know there's some Republican voters that are out there denying her olio we're trading the swamp yeah good luck with that horse crap - but the democratic party pretends to be on our side and for two months I mean what a pathetic effort for two months oh we will be principled for two months and then we will turn our back on you as always because our jobs to lose how do you think taking 12% of the money is going to lead to victories for you it is going to lead to inevitable losses here's a crazy idea I know you can't get off the crack of donor money because it goes into your pocket it was in the pockets of the people who work at the DNC their lobbyists friends their consultant friends it goes into all your pockets but what does it lead to it leads to permanent losses how could you possibly win with 12% so the crazy idea is don't take the money run uncorrupted campaigns where you go and tell the American people goddamnit aren't you sick of the corruption every single poll says yes goddamnit yes they're sick of the corruption that message will light this country on fire it'll work with independents they don't even work with some Republicans because they hate the corruption their voters hate it right instead you're like a to be justice krub but take less money do you think there's a good strategy no I think you're a goddamn loser and corrupt am I being clear enough so what do they buy what are the results let's take a look because some Democrats claim to really care about climate change some don't even bother but these were was a claim to care on the national level most bills from Democrats who purport to be Congress's biggest climate hogs amount to half measures either exempting major polluters such as the meat industry directing carbon tax revenues that could be used to mitigate the effects of climate change to lowering taxes of course to serve their donors even more or waiting until 2050 to end fossil fuel use and that's the best proposals we have the rest of the Democratic Party is even worse shape barney frank once said when being interviewed on The Young Turks what do you want us to take none of the banker money instead of 20% yes Barney Frank you schmuck if you take 20% of the donor money then you're in a 4-1 hole I don't know if you can do math they're gonna outgun you four to one you're always going to be in a permanent minority status for what for their crumbs you beg these donors for their crumbs and then they get mad at me for getting mad if you're not mad you're not paying attention Young Turks you're right in the middle of this podcast we've got another great segment coming up for you if you'd like to full show which is actually five segments go to tea white tea network.com slash join you become member you support the show you support independent media and you get the whole two-hour show ad free every day let's go do it now alright back in our Young Turks I'm actually gonna tell you a good story about unions in a second but I got worked up with my last segment all right so let's read some tweets to some comments Gabi Morita 86 says so when rich white dudes steal it's really just reallocation is that like affluenza but without the pretense kind of and then forest 2 min taro writes in gets caught shoplifting quote it's okay officer I'm just reallocating this shirt into my closet indeed so large G on YouTube super chat says hi guys i creeply sent ana a message on insta about this weekend but I'm a former Republican they can honestly say your shows change the entire way I approached politics you do you boo boos why thank you Lera and you do you as well boo boo right back at you okay and boy can I relate I'm also former Republican all right so little max's sent an email to army at TYT calm to help go through research and write reports but has been deliverable for over 24-48 hours I want in how can I help retired veteran with MBA and nothing but time on my hands so Little Mac I love you on a thousand different levels thank you for using YouTube super Chad that helps the show secondly I had a conversation this morning with general flesh nur and about the army and we are working on it and we are going to do different divisions including a research we are looking forward to having you as part of that division okay third of all already great results we believe that the AP definitely responded to us when they did their so-called fact check or Bernie Sanders Medicare for all and then when we hit them again they got hundreds of more tweets and emails so they have heard you loud and clear so that is that's great work by you guys and we're all gonna get better and better as we organize better about it is now over I think two thousand sixty two people in the TYT army and we just started a couple of weeks ago so we're gonna figure out exactly what the media is doing most wrong thanks to you guys and then go get them and again the whole point is not to destroy the media it's to help the media do a better job and and I think it's I think it's clear that they are havin establishment bias all right Richard Atkinson says on YouTube super Chad oil companies donate to Democrats so they win either way but Jenks is keep voting for those Dems even though he knows they are not on our side stop voting for them even in general elections Richard to that I say it depends and so you say I jank that's unacceptable it doesn't depend I'm not gonna vote for a guy Bob da da da da we've had this debate a thousand times we'll have it probably at a thousand more times he first of all anyone who complains about Democratic Party is gonna vote for an independent in their general election you better vote it in the primaries so espect look sometimes in the primaries you have no good choices bunch of corporate you know people and they they're all obvious like in Hawaii look I I and I should tell you that I'm I was wrong about that race that's two in a row that I've gotten wrong and you got to keep it real Kanye Lange lost over the weekend okay came in fourth he started at fourth he finished in fourth I was wrong okay he was a great progressive but didn't win the other people above him total corporate lobbies if canula was not in that race then you say I don't want to vote in that primary it's a hotel lobbyist versus a private prison lobbyist okay I hear you brothers and sisters but when you got somebody like Kanye Lang who was a great progressive in the race get out there vote in the primaries then if if he loses like edie case they so he won the primary in cases a total Blue Dog Democrat Hawaii the most progressive state put a massively pro war Pro tax cuts for the rich Democrat in as their choice now what are you gonna do you're gonna vote for a Republican I how does that make it better then you've eliminated all doubt as to whether he'll be Pro warm Pro tax cuts for the rich at least with a Democrat you might be able to pressure met cetera did I wanted case the win hell no Hawaii made a terrible mistake by the way their press is unbelievably corrupt and helps the corrupt like they did with that case but everything you know you saw 2016 you saw Donald Trump we live with this nightmare every day and you're still saying no no it's okay if Donald Trump wins well I don't agree I don't agree it's my job to keep it real both against the Democratic Party and they that establishment despises me okay and with you guys when it comes to both primaries and general elections that's my job all right let's go over here give you guys some good news for a change okay well sometimes unions are frustrating because they have not done a great job of fighting to get money out of politics and I talked about on the show sometimes they're fantastic as they fight for their workers and they get them better wages better pensions better hours so we are honest about the ups and the downs well I got good news for you because there's a union now doing something fantastic that we could all get behind so Reuters explains the labor union representing American teachers on Friday urged pension funds to cut their exposure to investment firms that have funneled millions of dollars into private prisons saying the companies are getting rich on the US government's practice of separating migrant families now that is true and that is plenty enough reason to make sure that none of your the money that you invest goes into supporting private prisons including your pension funds no matter what pension you are part of but you don't even need that private prisons are Anna nassima to America they imprison people and take away their liberty and their freedom for a profit they then give money to politicians and tell them to write laws to imprison more fellow Americans right or wrong you think they care if you're guilty or not it's a private prison they're the profit-making business if if they had a CEO who said no no I don't care about profits let's make sure that even if it means that we go out of business that we have justices in this country and have less people go to prison that CEO would be fired immediately because he would be doing this fiduciary responsibility no there is sent device to create more prisoners that's us that's not a foreign country they're imprisoning us let alone the migrants that are coming in so the good news continues in this case the American Federation of Teachers that's the unit in this story which influenced over 1 trillion dollars in public teacher pension plans published a report identifying more than two dozen firms that bet on jail operators core civic incorporated EEO Group Incorporated and defense contractor General Dynamics Corporation which has contracts with migrant shelters it's sent the report to patients around the country warning such investments could be hazardous General Dynamics says no no no you misunderstand us we don't imprison migrant kids well you must be so proud you only imprison migrants or other people for profit while you're starting other wars that's the trillion dollar pension fund that is the real power of the unions they should use that a lot more that's the only thing that people care about it and look if you read the big short by Michael Lewis or have talked to so many people that work in finance they consider unfortunately the pensions to be the suckers at the table at the end if things collapse again guess who's gonna get hurt the most the average American worker they're gonna take so much out of those patients go well there was nothing we could do the market crashed hey we all got our bonuses we all got our money out everybody is still rich except you guys you lost your pensions I'm telling you ahead of time that's what's gonna happen so for all the unions with those trillion dollar pension funds use your leverage god bless the American Federation of Teachers in this case a wonderful thing to do we should end all private prisons in this country hashtag End private prisons there's no excuse for them it's like having private cops oh no no that I'm sure they'll do the right thing and defend the poor anyway not just people who are paying them who are the rich who would be so foolish as to believe that private fire departments that would be insane private prisons is equally if not more insane last thing here on the overall trend and this is a totally positive story which is rare in this day and age but look at this great trend several prominent pension funds including the California State Teachers Retirement System and the Chicago teachers pension fund are evaluating their investments in private prisons last year New York City pension funds were the first to fully divest from the private prison industry the report said wonderful every pension fund should demand the divest from private prisons which is a scourge upon this country who are incentivized to lock up and take away people's freedom so they can make a profit and a buck off of it it is an outrage we should end all private prisons in this country Young Turks thanks for watching or listening to this
