It was a revealing
juxtaposition:
a row of
all-male senators,
and one woman sitting
in front of them.
A female sex crimes
prosecutor
called in on
their behalf to question
another woman,
Christine Blasey Ford,
about sexual assault
allegations against
Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
It was compounded by the
fact that a few days earlier
the prosecutor,
Rachel Mitchell,
had been referred to as —
“A female assistant —”
The scene shed light
on a simple fact:
There has never been
a Republican woman
on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It also foreshadowed
other awkward interactions
between male G.O.P. leaders
and women who say
they were sexually assaulted.
“You have power, when so
many women are powerless.”
This was
Senator Jeff Flake.
And this was
Senator Orrin Hatch.
The president and
Senator Chuck Grassley
both floated the
conspiracy theory
that the protesters
were backed
by liberal fundraiser
George Soros.
“Do you believe George Soros
is behind all of this?”
“I tend to
believe it.”
For Republicans,
this all points to
a problem that’s
bigger than optics.
The gender gap in
G.O.P. leadership extends
beyond the committee.
Of 51 Republican senators,
six are women.
Democrats have 17.
In the House, there are
23 Republican women —
and 61 Democratic ones —
out of
435 members.
The one overarching factor
is President Trump himself,
who has said
it’s a tough time —
not for women, but for
men, who he thinks
are often victims
of false allegations.
“Well, I say that it’s
a very scary time
for young men in America.”
The president even
went so far as
to mock Dr. Blasey’s
testimony at a rally.
“Where is the place?
I don’t remember.
How many years ago was it?
I don’t know. I don’t know.
I don’t know.”
Many women stand
by the president.
But in an election year,
with record numbers
of women running
for office,
only about one-quarter
are Republicans.
“I’ll actually support
President Trump.”
Those small numbers
mean the G.O.P. gender gap
is unlikely to shrink
any time soon.
