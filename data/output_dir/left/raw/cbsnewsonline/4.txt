00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,969
THE WORLD AND THEY HAVE DONE AN 

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,170
OUTSTANDING JOB PROTECTING US 

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,806
BUT WE HAVE TO HELP THE NYPD 

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:10,210
AND I WANT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE 

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:15,915
EVERY DAY PEOPLE CAN PLAY AN 

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,183
INCREDIBLE ROLE HELPING LAW 

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,219
ENFORCEMENT BY GETTING ANY 

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,054
INFORMATION YOU HAVE ON WHO 

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,288
MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS PLOT 

10
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:26,960
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BY BEING 

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,861
VERY VIGILANT ABOUT ANY 

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,396
PACKAGES THAT COME IN. 

13
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:31,431
THE PATTERN OF THESE PACKAGES 

14
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,298
HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY 

15
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,666
CONSISTENT BUT THAT DOES NOT 

16
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:40,140
MEAN THAT IF SOMETHING COMES IN 

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
THE LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, 

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,175
PEOPLE SHOULD NOT TAKE IT 

19
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,710
SERIOUSLY IF IT IS SUSPICIOUS 

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,048
TO THEM. 

21
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,283
WE NEED PEOPLE TO USE COMMON 

22
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:50,516
SENSE. 

23
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:51,284
IF THE PACKAGE LOOKS 

24
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,318
SUSPICIOUS, THERE'S ANY KIND OF 

25
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,119
CHEMICAL SMELL, ANY WIRING 

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,953
SHOWING, ANY INDICATION OF 

27
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:54,987
SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY, 

28
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:55,988
DO NOT OPEN THE PACKAGE. 

29
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,023
ALERT THE NYPD IMMEDIATELY AND 

30
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:57,624
CALL 91. 

31
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,024
-- 911. 

32
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,095
BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. 

33
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,763
THE QUESTION ON ANY BRUNCH MINE 

34
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,167
-- ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS HOW 

35
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:16,876
LONG WILL THIS GO ON? 

36
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,111
WE CANNOT TELL YOU HOW LONG 

37
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:18,911
THIS WILL GO EXACTLY. 

38
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:20,346
WE HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY 

39
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:20,679
EVENTUALITY. 

40
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,248
IT MIGHT BE HOURS OR DAYS OR 

41
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:22,481
WEEKS. 

42
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:23,583
THE VIGILANCE WE NEED TO SHOW 

43
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,018
IN THE MEANTIME IS WHAT HAST TO 

44
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,418
BE CONSISTENT.

00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:33,760
PEOPLE IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, 

47
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,794
THERE WILL BE A PRESS

00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,795
CONFERENCE AT ONE POLICE PLAZA, 

49
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,096

IT IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE WHOLE 

80
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:43,996
WORLD.

00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:44,864
NOTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN

[ SPEAKING SPANISH ] 

90
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,293

IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. 

99
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,378
THE MAYOR POINTED OUT THINGS 

100
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:39,185
