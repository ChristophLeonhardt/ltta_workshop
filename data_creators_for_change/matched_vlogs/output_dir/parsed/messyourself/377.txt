whoo hello everyone how is everyone
doing it is my sister there and today
ladies Jim and we are back yet again
with every rain thank you guys so much
for the support in this series so far
you upload my mind I love you guys like
I I genuinely love you thank you guys so
much for spending so much time with me
and yeah let us continue the gang baby
the killer is white aged between 30 and
45 he doesn't act on impulse but plans
his crimes in a very meticulous fashion
he doesn't have anything personal
against the victims that's why he covers
it faces with mud to make them anonymous
why does he kill them if he doesn't have
anything against them well yeah him the
more of an image assemble that's
probably why he gives him an origami
figure and an orchid as gifts to
apologize for what he's done to them
what kind of what was it boy interesting
and where does all that get us uh good
uh call the best way of tracking a
predator is to be familiar with his
behavior that may be true in novels but
there's a child's life at stake here
listen she continued Jaden he's probably
getting angry with me uh geoprofile then
I studied the geographical distribution
of the murders generally a killer
commits his first murder near to where
he lives so he has a safe place to flee
to if any complications arise more
confident he becomes the further he
roams from his base walleye analyzing
the locations where the victims
disappeared I was able to isolate his
own where the killer might live who and
what size is this zone
the moment about 10 square mile oh great
must be ten thousand people live in that
sort area what is this touchdown one by
one
be aggressive it may not give us the
address of the killer but at least did
something to go on
yeah Blake if you've got a better plan
I'm willing to listen
yeah you sure I'm all ears what's up
black Oh
one detail attracted my attention the
interval between the time when a victim
disappears in the time when the body is
found ranges from three to five days but
the rainfall is always at six inches
give or take ten percent okay what on
earth does that mean yeah all the
victims are drowning rainwater the
killer kills only in the fall when there
was plenty of rain whoa me that he puts
them in some sort of well or tank that
is open to the skies and that fills up a
rain water like Sean Maher drains the
less time the victim has to live oh my
god oh what's that snow there are two
suspects your psychological profile
might fit and can be connected to the
comfort zone I'd like to question them
ah damn it we're wasting our time with
this bullshit shut up
the killer's out there somewhere we got
to get off our asses and find that's
what I'm doing go for like I've got just
about enough of your good jokes you
chasing this guy for what two years
who do you got huh nothing nothing
fucking lutely nothing I will be loving
me with your psychology degree and your
great glasses let me tell you something
pal that don't mean zip when it comes to
getting out there
you're just a fucking bureaucrat well
what's up
go for it I came here to find a killer
I met a first of all and it's exactly
what I'm gonna do with or without your
ass or what enough
what's up you said it took six inches of
rainfall before the victim died how much
time do we have left at the weather
forecast right less than 72 hours 72
hours to save Shaun oh my gosh okay now
we're going to go investigate a
potential a potential suspect hello
Norman Jayden here
knock on the door get maybe is no harm
should we bust down the door no answer
we waste our time coming knocks down the
door
maybe we should have a little look
inside anyway there's nobody home
break-in oh shit he's gonna bust out the
door he doesn't give a shit
there is now crazy I'm not sure that's
entirely legal no it's not call the cops

Nathaniel Williams is a pretty religious
guy oh my gosh the guard Revere an idiot
waiting for the end of the world oh my
god I'm a few months back because he was
causing a disturbance in the park he was
ranting and raving said he heard voices
at this idea in his sick little head

earth to persecute him oh my gosh real
twisted that is really messed up this
guy's like a god freak

people could be killers oh my god all
right listen dude you can't just break
in all the doors you're gonna move past
I can see um yeah I mean like the killer
seems smart and organized and this just
seems like a really crazy man who takes
a lot of drugs and believes in
everything in all the Jesus's okay for
all the signs of a mystical obsessive
neurosis compounded by a persecution
complex uh what are in place you don't
have to be a profiler to see he's not a
killer we're wasting our time here

right Susan
sorry our neighbors thanks for looking
after my baby it's okay they won't leave
her
it just couldn't cope anymore
just I mean Jeremy Jeremy he was such a
good boy
oh shit can't understand why anyone
would want to hurt him
man this is a sad job man you take care
of this baby on your own doesn't
Jeremy's father live with you anymore he
disappeared the day after Jeremy I don't
know what happened to him he disappeared
but maybe maybe he couldn't take it
ever since I've had to look after Emily
all on my own and couldn't do it anymore
Jesus Christ
did your husband say anything before he
disappeared maybe did he leave a note or
something no he left the house without a
word and
there was just the cellphone South
shuffle yeah I found a cell phone in his
dresser what I'm sure it wasn't his I
had never seen it before I tried to turn
it on but it didn't work
do you still have it yeah it's um it's
in a drawer in the living room ooh you
can have it if you'd like I'm sure it's
of more use to you than to me do any
family or anybody to help you yeah my
mother
I didn't want to ask her for anything we
don't really get along but I guess I'm
out of options
shit well look after yourself and Emma
I will
ah shit so the father disappeared the
day after the boy got kidnapped do you
think that's because the origami killer
did the same thing that they were doing
to Ethan and giving him the five trials
I think so you know because the others
the shopkeeper got shoe box as well okay
and the the other Yaya the prostitutes
father as well
Laurens father no yeah the prostitutes
husband disappeared as well good luck
Emily you take care of your mama yeah
maybe maybe all the fathers have been
set up with this trial and if the
fathers fail the trial then this
children die his cell phone because we
got a cell phone from Eaton as well
doesn't work
shitty
okay I think that's it
I think we're ready to go
shit boy she man
that's mad it's all coming together guys
and I wonder what these trials are going
to be the five origami trials man it's
gonna be so good so good baby
now it's getting interesting I think now
