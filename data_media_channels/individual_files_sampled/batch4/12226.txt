you know there was an article by Lila attached Feeny I don't know in a thing called broadly called how to celebrate the 4th of July when America is a constant disappointment and I really think that this is the way a lot on the left field America has always been bad no matter who the president is or was since Trump's election however the qualities that make America particularly bad racism sexism homophobia the institutionalized manifestation of each of these etc have been emboldened forcing many people to reckon with the ugly reality of their beloved USA this is not America I keep hearing but the truth of the matter is the family separation a disregard for black lives homophobia and every other incarnation of white male supremacy or exactly what America is made of now here my point is simply this people like this who cares what they say about America if you hate it here first of all there's a plane leaving every five minutes I mean get on it man I mean why why are you sitting around but secondly if you don't love the place you don't get to say if you don't love the Arts if you sit around and say I hate movies I hate but now I don't care what you have to say about movies I don't care how you think they're gonna be changed by your brilliance they're not you've got to love the thing you want to fix you got to love the thing you want to change their look I think there's their changes that are gonna come in America changes that I think must come all kinds of things that injustice is that I'd like to see fixed of course but I love this country because of what it created out of the out of nothing out of out of European out of 2,000 years of European bloodshed it created an idea it caught an idea it captured the essence of the conscience of the West in the declaration in the Constitution and has been living closer and closer to that those ideals for the last over 200 years these people if they hate it I do not see how they are actually going to change anything
