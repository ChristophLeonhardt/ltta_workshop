371
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,031
THAT'S WHEN THE GIRL WENT PAST

373
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,599
I RAN OVER THERE. 

374
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,468
THE FIRST GIRL.  

375
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,036

INTO THE CHARLES -- CARL'S JR.? 

377
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,944

378
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,780
LOOK BACK AND SHE PUT HER LEG 

379
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,684
ON THE TABLE.  

380
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:46,952

382
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,554
>> THEN I WENT BACK OUT TO SEE 

383
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,388
WHAT WAS GOING ON. 

384
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,123
AND THEN THE OTHER LADY WAS 

385
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,125

386
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,495
HE SEDGE SHE IS SHOP.

00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,130
AND I SAID, I HEARD IT. 

389
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,766

RAPID FIRE, IT DIDN'T STOP. 

393
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,074
THERE WAS NO MERCY. 

394
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,945
WHOEVER SHOT THAT TIME, IT WAS 

395
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:17,783

399
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,087
ELSE BECAUSE THERE WERE FOUR 

400
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:22,888
MORE SHOTS AFTER THAT. 

401
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,723
IT WENT BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, AND 

402
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,758
THEN AFTER THAT I HEARD 

403
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,158
NOTHING.  

404
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:26,959
>> Reporter: WHAT'S GOING 

405
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,959
THROUGH YOUR MIND WITH PEOPLE 

406
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,194

YOU HAVE TO THINK FAST AND 

413
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:44,710
SMART. 

414
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,445
I DIDN'T HAVE A GUN ON ME BUT I 

415
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,279
WISH I DID.  

416
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,280
>> Reporter: DESCRIBE FOR ME

420
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,785

WOUND. 

424
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,269
AND HE SAYS IN HIS OWN WORDS, 

425
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,636
NO MERCY. 

426
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:12,637
THERE WAS POSSIBLY A THIRD 

427
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:13,672
VICTIM BECAUSE HE HEARD MORE 

428
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,272
SHOTS AFTER THAT. 

429
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,008
THIS STARTED AT SOME SORT OF UP

FROM WHAT I AM TOLD, THE 

434
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,214
SHOOTER DIDN'T WALK UP TO THE 

435
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,748

437
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,754

COLLEAGUES GETTING TO THE SCENE 

458
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,795
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A FLUID 

459
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:11,796
SITUATION BUT A NUMBER OF 

460
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,565

WORD FROM STANFORD HEALTHCARE,

THEY ARE EXPECTING 4 TO 5 

465
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,377
PATIENTS FROM THIS SHOOTING. 

466
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,044
THAT'S NEW INFORMATION. 

467
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,212
A SHORT TIME AGO, SAN FRANCISCO 

468
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,012
GENERAL HOSPITAL SAID THEY 

469
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,214
COULD NOT CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF 

470
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,248
PATIENTS THAT THEY WOULD BE 

471
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,916
TAKING IN, BUT THAT THEY WERE 

472
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,554
IN FACT, TAKING SOME IN, AND 

473
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,888
THAT COULD BE UP TO A HALF-

474
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:37,122
DOZEN. 

475
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,356
THERE'S POSSIBLY 11 VICTIMS 

476
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,024
BEING TAKEN TO LOCAL HOSPITALS 

477
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,459
AS FAR AS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW. 

478
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:42,460
LUCKILY, THE LOCAL CORONER HAS 

479
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,962
SAID NO DEATHS HAVE BEEN 

480
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:48,133

00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:49,768
THIS POINT IN TIME. 

483
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,769
THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IS 

484
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,171
GOOD NEWS AT THIS POINT IN THE 

485
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:52,938
DAY. 

486
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:53,972
OF COURSE, THAT SITUATION CAN 

487
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,606
CHANGE VERY QUICKLY. 

488
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,107
IT'S UNKNOWN WHAT THE SUBJECT 

489
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:59,278

490
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,479
THAT HAS BEEN FLOATING BACK AND 

491
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:00,712

IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT GOOGLE WAS

552
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:53,859
HOSKO. WE HEARD FROM SOURCES 

553
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:58,930
THAT IT UP ATTENTION CHILLY -- 

554
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,765
THAT THE SHOOTER COULD 

555
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,766
POTENTIALLY BE A WHITE FEMALE. 

556
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 

557
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,501
DOES THIS FIT ANY SORT OF 

558
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,236
PROFILE?  

559
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,773
>> Reporter: IT DOESN'T,  

560
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,006
REENA. 

561
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:08,907
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROFILE THESE 

562
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:13,478
CASES  WITH ANY TYPE OF 

563
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,946
OVERWHELMING CERTAINTY. 

564
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,749
YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT 

565
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,217
DRIVERS, USUALLY PEOPLE WITH 

566
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,953
DIFFERENT STRESSORS IN THEIR 

567
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,055
LIVES. 

568
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,157
WHETHER THERE IS A MENTAL 

569
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,825
HEALTH ASPECT OF IT OR NOT, 

570
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,994
VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU SEE IS, 

571
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,965
THESE ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY 

572
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,200
MALES. THESE ATTACKERS ARE 

573
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,969
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY MALE 

574
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,136
ATTACKERS. 

575
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,472
TO COME UP WITH ANY KIND OF 

576
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:50,916
MEANINGFUL PROFILE ON A FEMALE 

577
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,716
ACTIVE SHOOTER, MATH SHOOTER, 

578
00:20:51,716 --> 00:20:52,551
MASS ATTACKER, WOULD BE 

579
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,352
DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE 

580
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,386
NUMERICALLY THEY ARE SO SMALL. 

581
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,821
>> I ALSO WANT TO BRING IN PAUL 

582
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,421
THE A LIST. 

583

DO WE STILL HAVE PAUL WITH US? 

584
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,691
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK WE MAY 

585
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,959
HAVE LOST HIM.

HE SAID IT HAPPENED AT A PARTY, 

591
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:25,450
SOME SORT OF CELEBRATION. YOU

TALK ABOUT SECURING A PERIMETER 

593
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:35,761
LIKE THIS. HOW DO YOU HARD IN A 

594
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,898

CAMPUS ATMOSPHERE THEN THERE IS 

599
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,337

MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL, 

601
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:55,480
WHERE SECURITY IS INTENDED TO 

602
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,515
BE FIRMER, YOU ARE REALLY 

603
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,516
TRYING TO LIMIT PEOPLE COMING 

604
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,950
IN AND GOING OUT FROM A WIDE 

605
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,551
NUMBER OF ENTRANCES. 

606
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:07,759
THAT TENDS NOT TO BE THE CASE 

607
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,594
WITH BUSINESSES. 

608
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,764
OFTENTIMES THEY ARE BUILT TO BE

CASUALLY, SOMETIMES WITH SOME 

614
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:36,254
SORT OF A CAR READER. VERY OFTEN

615
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,389
THESE ARE VERY OPEN CAMPUSES 

616
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,590
AND INTENDED TO BE THAT WAY. 

617
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,060
THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO 

618
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,661
DEAL WITH.  

619
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,329

WHEN I WAS COMING IN THERE WAS 

624
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,312
A BIG COMMOTION COMING FROM 

625
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:00,912
ACROSS THE STREET. 

626
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,147
LADY CAME AND WENT INTO THE

CARL'S JR. AND HAD BEEN SHOT IN 

628
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:03,949
THE FOOT. 

629
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,383
THAT WAS ABOUT AT THE TIME THE 

630
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,585
POLICE DARTED TO COME IN AND 

631
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,953

FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. 

639
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,627
IT WAS PROBABLY AS FAR FROM ME 

640
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:23,502

THE STREAM OF PEOPLE COMING OUT

WITH THEIR HANDS OFF, AND YOU 

882
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:13,497
SAID THAT'S AN INDICATION OF 

883
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:13,964
SOMETHING. 

884
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:14,197
>> YES. 

885
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:14,598
MOST CERTAINLY. 

886
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:15,365
THAT IS AN INDICATION THAT 

887
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:17,401
POLICE KNOW SHOULD DO NOT HAVE 

888
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,636
THE SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS AND THE 

889
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:20,103
SITUATION CONTAINED. 

890
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,572
SO AS YOU SEE PEOPLE COME UP, 

891
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:27,311
POLICE HAVE TO DO THIS. 

892
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,546
AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THE OP -- 

893
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,048
OPTIC, AS WE SAW IN PARKLAND, 

894
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:33,683
THE SHOOTER WALKED OUT WITH THE 

895
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:36,086
STUDENT, SO POLICE ARE TRAINED 

896
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,788
TO MAKE SURE UNTIL THE 

897
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,190
SITUATION IS ENTIRELY 

898
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,525
CONTAINED, AND THE SHOOTER AND 

899
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,327
SHOOTERS HAVE BEEN MITIGATED, 

900
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,062
THEN UNTIL THEN, NOT UNTIL 

901
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,764
THEN, CAN THEY LET THIS 

902
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,534
SITUATION GO WITHOUT HAVING 

903
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,538
PEOPLE HANDS UP, AND PATTED 

904
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:54,738
DOWN. 

905
00:37:54,738 --> 00:38:00,278
>> I WANT TO BRING IN RON 

906
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:00,544
HOSKO. 

907
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,582
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 

908
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,082
KNOW RIGHT NOW? 

909
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,284
>> THE ONE PIECE OF WHAT SEEMS 

910
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:11,655
TO BE ENCOURAGES NEWS IS WE 

911
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:14,492
DON'T SEE THE POLICE OR OTHER 

912
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,060
PEOPLE DUCKING FOR COVER. 

913
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,729
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ADDITIONAL 

914
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,497
SHOTS, CALLS OF SHOTS FIRED. 

915
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:22,867
SO WITH THAT, ONE WOULD THINK 

916
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,036
THAT EITHER THIS SITUATION HAS 

917
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:28,973
STABILIZED INSIDE, WHETHER THAT 

918
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,707
IS THE SUBJECT CONCEALING 

919
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,343
THEMSELVES WHILE POLICE HUNT 

920
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,745
FOR THEM, WHETHER THE SUBJECT 

921
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,881
OR POLICE HAVE NEUTRAL AISLED 

922
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,949
THIS SHOOTER, OR WHETHER THE 

923
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,218
PERSON HAS, YOU KNOW, WALKED 

924
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,786
OUT WITH A WEAPON OR WITHOUT. 

925
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:46,423
THIS SITUATION SEEMS TO BE 

926
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:47,291
STABILIZED JUST BECAUSE THERE 

927
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,026
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE FRANTIC 

928
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,895
ACTIVITY AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD 

929
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,031
ANYMORE SHOTS OR CALLS OF SHOTS 

930
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:54,465
FIRED. 

931
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,499
SO THAT PART IS ENCOURAGING. 

932
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,668
BUT THE QUESTION IS, DO THEY 

933
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,535
KNOW WHO THIS IS? 

934
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:02,339
OR IS THIS A LONGER PURSUIT OF 

935
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,208
SOMEBODY WHO DID GET AWAY? 

936
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,809
WHAT ARE THE POLICE DOING, WHAT 

937
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:08,745
DO THEY KNOW RIGHT NOW? 

938
00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:10,814
ARE THEY HUNTING THE PERSON OUT 

939
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:12,450
ASSIGNMENT THE PERIMETER 

940
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,850
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHO IT IS? 

941
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,555
I THINK PAUL WAS TALKED ABOUT 

942
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,958
IT BEFORE, PART OF THE JOB, IS 

943
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:21,825
APART FROM HUNTING DOWN AN 

944
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:25,395
ACTIVE SHOOTER, IF THEY ARE 

945
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,496
OUTSIDE OF THIS PERIMETER, THE 

946
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:29,633
PART OF THE POLICE WORK IS TO 

947
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,069
PUT, PULL TOGETHER ALL THOSE 

948
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,071
LITTLE BITS OF INFORMATION THAT 

949
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,575
MAY LEAD TO THE IDENTITY SO 

950
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,411
THEY CAN BRING THIS PERSON INTO 

951
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:40,678
CUSTODY. 

952
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:44,948
SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S 

953
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:45,916
PROCEEDING RIGHT NOW, AND 

954
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,651
CLEARLY SOMETHING BAD HAS 

955
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:48,819
HAPPENED AT THIS FACILITY WHERE 

956
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,687
WE HEAR REPORTS OF THE INJURED, 

957
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:52,456
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW 

958
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:57,027
WHAT THE END GAME IS LOOKING 

959
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:57,227
LIKE. 

960
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:57,661
IS IT SUICIDE? 

961
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,630
IS IT SUICIDE BY COP? 

962
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,533
OR EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE WITH 

963
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:06,803
POLICE INSIDE AND THE 

964
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:07,604
SITUATION'S BEEN NEUTRALIZED OR 

965
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:08,805
IS SOMEBODY ON THE RUN? 

966
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,975
>>> AND THE FACT THAT THE 

967
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,110
CONNOR IS ON THE SCENE, WHAT -- 

968
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,313
CORONER IS ON THE SCENE, WHAT 

969
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:16,746
DOES THAT SUGGEST? 

970
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:18,915
>> IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS 

971
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:19,750
BEEN FATALLY INJURED, EVEN 

972
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,387
THOUGH IT'S THE POLICE ROLE TO 

973
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:25,188
DECLARE SOMEBODY DECEASED. 

974
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:26,957
YOU WILL KEEP THAT PERSON IN 

975
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,325
THE STATE THEY WERE FOUND SO 

976
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,394
THAT THE CORONER CAN COME TO 

977
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,997
THE SCENE AND DEE CLEAR 

978
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,533
SOMEBODY LEGALLY DEAD, AND THEN 

979
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,135
LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE DOING 

980
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:38,702
THEIR EVIDENCE COLLECT AND 

981
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,805
DOCUMENTATION WORK, AND SO IT 

982
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:43,073
COULD BE THAT FATALLY INJURED 

983
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,109
VICTIMS ARE LEFT IN PLACE FOR A 

984
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,444

WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 

1007
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,704
KNOW AT THIS POINT? 

1008
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:49,606
>> WELL, WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS 

1009
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,742
POINT IS, WE'RE NOT HEARING

FURTHER SHOTS, WHICH IS 

1011
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,645
ENCOURAGING, BUT THE OTHER PART 

1012
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,013
THEY'RE MOVING THE PERIMETER SO 

1013
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,615
WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THERE'S 

1014
00:41:58,615 --> 00:41:59,816
STILL A SIGNIFICANT A 

1015
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:01,018
INFORMATION WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 

1016
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,587
THINK OF IT THIS WAY, THIS IS A 

1017
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:04,220
HUGE BUILDING. 

1018
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,056
I DON'T KNOW THE AMOUNT OF 

1019
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:06,990
SQUARE FEET, BUT IT'S HUGE. 

1020
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,792
POLICE NEED TO CLEAR THIS 

1021
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,058

1022
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,593
THERE ARE STILL SOULS IN THE

1027
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:30,413

00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,412
TO GET EYES IN THE BUILDING SO 

1039
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:04,013
THEY CAN IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE 

1040
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:06,784

00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,430
SO THAT'S ANOTHER TASK OF THIS 

1101
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,332
AT HAND, TRYING TO GET HUNDREDS 

1102
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,368
OF PEOPLE OUT OF FROM WHILE 

1103
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:08,638
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID 

1104
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:09,039
THIS. 

1105
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,707
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF A FEMALE 

1106
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,209
SHOOTER AND MALE, THAT'S WHAT 

1107
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,476
POLICE MAY BE LOOKING FOR, BUT 

1108
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:15,846
THE POLICE CHIEF WILL HAVE MORE 

1109
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:16,313
UPDATED INFORMATION. 

1110
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,849
WE DO WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM TO 

1111
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:20,584
PROVIDE THAT OFFICIAL WORD 

1112
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,986
BECAUSE THAT COULD HELP CALM A 

1113
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,287
LOT OF PEOPLE'S NERVES. 

1114
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:27,724
THIS IS A WIDER VIEW, A MASSIVE 

1115
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:28,224
COMPLEX THERE. 

1116
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:33,363
1700 PEOPLE IN THE YOUTUBE 

1117
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:33,997

1118
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:37,567
HUNDRED NEARBY AT THE BUSY 

1119
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:39,669
OFFICES, ON TUESDAY, AT 1:00. 

1120
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:42,472

1122
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:44,508
TO LUNCH, THERE'S A NEARBY 

1123
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,510
SHOPPING CENTER WHERE PEOPLE GO 

1124
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,113
TO EAT, AND AROUND 1:00, THAT'S 

1125
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:51,481
WHAT MANY WERE DOING, AND THIS 

1126
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:54,817
OCCURRED -- RIGHT THERE AT THE 

1127
00:45:54,817 --> 00:45:55,419
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. 

1128
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:59,756
>> THE BIG QUESTION FOR A LOT 

1129
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:00,958
OF PEOPLE IS THE INJURIES, THE 

1130
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:01,658
CASUALTIES FROM THIS SITUATION, 

1131

00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,731

SOUTH SOUTH -- SOME SOUTH, AND 

1142
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,650
THE FACT THAT THE CORONER VAN 

1143
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,986
HAS BEEN CALLED INDICATES THERE 

1144
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,521
COULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST ONE 

1145
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:33,857

1183
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:05,849
THIS CAME FROM TWO RELIABLE

WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER, 

1190
00:48:12,388 --> 00:48:14,091
STATISTICALLY, WHEN WE LOOK AT 

1191
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,593
THE WORKPLACE SHOOTING 

1192
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:26,769

RIGHT NOW. 

1204
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:46,923
I BELIEVE, BASED ON WHAT WE 

1205
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:57,267
HAVE BEEN TOLD SO FAR, IN MY 

1206
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,468

FLEEING FROM THE BUILDING. 

1221
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,049
IT WAS VERY CHAOTIC. 

1222
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:15,385
ONE VICTIM WAS IMPAIRED WITH A

TWO ADDITIONAL VICTIMS WERE 

1235
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:39,676

1248
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,637
WE BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE 

1249
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:08,505
SHOOTER BUT WE ARE STILL 

1250
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,339

WE COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH THIS 

1257
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:19,683

NOW WE ARE GOING THROUGH WITH A 

1272
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:47,978

00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,306
COLLABORATION IS BEING USED AND 

1461
00:56:17,306 --> 00:56:20,877
NEEDED -- THAT IS BEING USED 

1462
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,446
AND IS NEEDED IN THIS SITUATION.

1463
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,015
>> PAUL, WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS 

1464
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,149
THAT OVERWHELMINGLY, IT'S 

1465
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:35,325
ALWAYS A MALE SHOOTER?  

1466
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,793
>> Reporter: I CAN TELL YOU I 

1467
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:37,961
HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 38 

1468
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,228
YEARS. 

1469
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,396
UNEQUIVOCALLY, IT'S THE WAY 

1470
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,430
THAT, FROM A BEHAVIORAL SIDE, 

1471
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,998
THE WAY THAT MEN AND WOMEN 

1472
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:42,231
THINK. 

1473
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:43,266
WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE RATIONAL, 

1474
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,667
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 

1475
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:50,106
THEY DON'T HESITATE TO SEEK 

1476
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:50,940
OTHERS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT. 

1477
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,475
MEN ARE MUCH MORE SPONTANEOUS 

1478
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,679
AND IMPETUOUS AND FEEL THEY 

1479
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,613
NEED TO RESOLVE IT THEMSELVES. 

1480
00:56:57,613 --> 00:56:59,048
I THINK THE MALE EGO KICKS IN 

1481
00:56:59,048 --> 00:56:59,682
FAR MORE OFTEN. 

1482
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,884
THAT'S WHY YOU WILL FIND, I 

1483
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,318
TRULY BELIEVE THAT'S WHY WE 

1484
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,255
FIND MORE -- FAR MORE MEN 

1485
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:05,988
PERPETRATING ACTS OF VIOLENCE 

1486
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,824
THEN WE DO WOMEN. 

1487
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:15,098
>> THAT'S A FASCINATING TAKE, 

1488
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:15,331
PAUL. 

1489
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,733
IF YOU COULD STICK WITH US, I 

1490
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,067
WANT TO BRING IN JAMIE YUCCAS 

1491
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:18,601
FROM LOS ANGELES. 

1492
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:26,876
WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW, JAMIE? 

1493
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,478
ED REENA, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU 

1494
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,913
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU TWO 

1495
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:30,580
WERE JUST DISCUSSING. 

1496
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,748
WE DUG INTO SOME INFORMATION TO 

1497
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:32,748
SEE HOW MANY FEMALE SHOOTERS 

1498
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:33,750
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MASS 

1499
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,117
SHOOTINGS. 

1500
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,418
IN 2006 AND EXPOSED THE WORKER  

1501
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,652
HAD A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS 

1502
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:37,687
AND KILLED SIX OTHER POSTAL 

1503
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,521
WORKERS IN NEW MEXICO. 

1504
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,722
IN 2014 IT WAS A 44-YEAR-OLD 

1505
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:44,794
WOMAN WHO OPENED FIRE ON A 

1506
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,461
TRIBAL MEETING, NATIVE AMERICAN 

1507
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:46,195
TRIBAL MEETING, KILLING FOUR 

1508
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:46,428
PEOPLE. 

1509
00:57:46,428 --> 00:57:47,463
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER IN 

1510
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:48,264
CALIFORNIA, THERE WAS SAN 

1511
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,064
BERNARDINO BACK IN DECEMBER 

1512
00:57:49,064 --> 00:57:50,266
2015 WHERE ONE OF THE SUSPECTS 

1513
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,266
IN THAT SHOOTING WAS FEMALE. 

1514
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:59,976
SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE ON 

1515
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,044
SCENE IN SAN BERNARDINO FOR 

1516
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:01,344
RATCHETING. 

1517
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:01,977
IT IS VERY RARE. 

1518
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:03,780
WE DUG INTO THE STATISTICS FOR 

1519
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,614
YOU. 

1520
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:05,682
ACCORDING TO MOTHER JONES 

1521
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:06,749
MAGAZINE WHO HAS KEPT A 

1522
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:07,550
DATABASE ON MASS SHOOTINGS 

1523
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,154
SINCE 1980, THE INFORMATION WE 

1524
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,789
KNOW AT THIS POINT IS A LOT OF 

1525
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:13,656
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING. 

1526
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,924
WE WERE LISTENING TO THE PRESS 

1527
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,325
CONFERENCE THAT THE POLICE 

1528
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:23,233

1529
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,502
BARBERINI, THAT HE SAID THEY 

1530
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:34,577
STARTED IMMEDIATELY ON THE 

1531
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,345
SCENE, ENCOUNTEED ONE VICTIM 

1532
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,546
IS A WALKED INTO THE DOOR. 

1533
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:37,580
WE KNOW THAT THREE OTHER 

1534
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,948
VICTIMS WERE ALSO TRANSPORTED 

1535
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:50,226
TO THE HOSPITAL, A LITTLE 

1536
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:50,493
EARLIER. 

1537
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:51,794
WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST TWO OF 

1538
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,029
THOSE VICTIMS HAVE GONE TO THE 

1539
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:53,296
HOSPITAL. 

1540
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,063
STANFORD HOSPITAL AND SAN 

1541
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:54,897
FRANCISCO GENERAL BOTH SAID 

1542
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:55,932
THEY WERE TAKING AND VICTIMS. 

1543
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,133
THERE COULD BE OTHERS THAT HAVE 

1544
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:57,734
BEEN TAKEN IN. 

1545
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,168
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR 

1546
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:00,737
THOSE NUMBERS AS THEY COME OUT. 

1547
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:01,704
NOW THEY ARE METHODICALLY GOING 

1548
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,872
THROUGH THE OFFICE BUILDING TO 

1549
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,239
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET 

1550
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,209
EVERYBODY OUT. 

1551
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,710
WHEN WE LOOKED INTO SOME OF THE 

1552
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,845
RESEARCH, THERE'S ABOUT 1700 

1553
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:13,049
EMPLOYEES ON ANY GIVEN DAY. 

1554
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,350
THAT COULD FLUCTUATE. 

1555
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,653
WATCHING TO SEE WHEN THIS SCENE 

1556
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:26,396
IS ACTUALLY CLEAR AND WE ARE 

1557
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,196
STILL WAITING FOR INFORMATION 

1558
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:28,631
TO COME IN AS THE SHERIFF SAID. 

1559
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,866
THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION. 

1560
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,534
>> JAMIE YUCCAS, THANK YOU SO 

1561
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,069
MUCH FOR THAT FASCINATING TAKE 

1562
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:33,636
ON THOSE NUMBERS. 

1563
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,972
I WANT TO KNOW TAKE YOU TO OUR 

1564
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:42,545
SAN FRANCISCO STATION, KPIX, 

1565
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:43,579
WHO IS FOLLOWING THIS ENTIRE 

1566
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:43,879
AFTERMATH. 

1567
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:44,647
THEY ARE CURRENTLY GOING 

1568
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:45,048
THROUGH. 

1569
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,049
THERE ARE SO MANY CUBICLES AND 

1570
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,283
OFFICES ON HALLWAY THEY HAVE TO 

1571
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:47,516
SEARCH. 

1572
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:48,651
THEY ARE DOING THAT NOW. 

1573
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,518
THAT IS QUITE A TASK. 

1574
00:59:49,518 --> 00:59:50,687
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS AND 

1575
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,721
ADJACENT BUSINESSES WHERE THEY 

1576
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:52,555
SAW TWO OTHER VICTIMS. 

1577
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,290
THEY ARE NOW GOING TO ALL OF 

1578
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,825
THOSE BUILDINGS TO MAKE SURE 

1579
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,026
THAT PEOPLE GET OUT SAFELY AND 

1580
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,660
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE INVOLVED IN 

1581
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,697
THIS SHOOTING.  

1582
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:07,103
>> Reporter: WE HAVE ANDREA LIVE

1583
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,538
ON SCENE AND SHE HAS BEEN 

1584
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:09,405
SPEAKING WITH SOME OF THE 

1585
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:10,606
PEOPLE THAT WERE INSIDE OF THE 

1586
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:11,441
BUILDING WHEN THE SHOOTING 

1587
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:11,841
BROKE OUT. 

1588
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,076
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?  

1589
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,511
>> Reporter: I SPOKE TO 2 

1590
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,512
ENGINEERS THAT WORK AT YOUTUBE. 

1591
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:17,947
ONE WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE 

1592
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,515
BUILDING WHEN HE BELIEVES THE 

1593
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:20,817
GUNFIRE BROKE OUT. HE CAME 

1594
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:21,083
OUTSIDE. 

1595
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,485
HE THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE ALARM. 

1596
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,020
THE FIRE ALARMS WENT OFF. 

1597
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:30,760
HE GRABBED HIS BRIEFCASE AND 

1598
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,160
RAN OUTSIDE. 

1599
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,161
ESAU SOMEBODY WITH WHAT HE 

1600
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,396
BELIEVED IT TO BE A GUNSHOT 

1601
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,630
WUND AND BLOOD COMING OUT OF 

1602
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:34,997
HIS STOMACH. 

1603
01:00:34,997 --> 01:00:36,999
THE SECOND ENGINEER I SPOKE TO 

1604
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:45,341
SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS BALLOONS 

1605
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:45,975
POPPING AT FIRST. 

1606
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,143
HE THEN QUICKLY REALIZED IT WAS 

1607
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,377
GUNSHOTS AND HE RAN INSIDE AND 

1608
01:00:48,377 --> 01:00:49,846
HELD THE DOOR OPEN FOR A FEW 

1609
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,013
OTHERS AND HE SAW SOME PEOPLE 

1610
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:52,949
INSIDE THAT WERE CROUCHING 

1611
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,284
BENEATH PICNIC TABLES AND THERE 

1612
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,953
WAS A BODY IN FRONT DOOR SO HE 

1613
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,354
COULD NOT JOIN THEM. 

1614
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,589
WE WRAPPED UP WITH THE POLICE 

1615
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:03,226
CHIEF A FEW MINUTES AGO. THE 

1616
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,861
CALLS INITIALLY CAME IN AT 

1617
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:08,965
12:44 THIS AFTERNOON. 

1618
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,333
THEY WERE ON SCENE AT 12:40 A. 

1619
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,567
THEY SAY WHEN THEY ARRIVED ON 

1620
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:12,835
CAMPUS ON CHERRY AVENUE IN SAN 

1621
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,836
BRUNO, THERE WAS ONE PERSON 

1622
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:14,971
WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND WHO WAS 

1623
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:23,112
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE DOOR, 

1624
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,414
LAYING DOWN IN FRONT OF THE 

1625
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:24,614
DOOR. 

1626
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:25,748
THEY FOUND A SECOND BODY WHICH 

1627
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:26,983
THEY BELIEVE WAS THE SHOOTER, A 

1628
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:37,760
FEMALE WITH A SELF-INFLICTED 

1629
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,194
GUNSHOT WOUND. 

1630
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,195
THEY THEN FOUND TWO MORE 

1631
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:39,428
PEOPLE. 

1632
01:01:39,428 --> 01:01:40,429
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ALL BEEN 

1633
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:40,762
TRANSPORTED. 

1634
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:41,664
THEY BELIEVE THE SHOOTER IN 

1635
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,099
THIS CASE WAS A FEMALE WHO DID 

1636
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,434
IN FACT SHOOT HERSELF AND KILL 

1637
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:44,700
HERSELF. 

1638
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,868
THEY ARE STILL DOING A FLOOR BY 

1639
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:46,702
FLOOR SECONDARY -- SECONDARY 

1640
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:50,773
SEARCH TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY 

1641
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,173
OTHER EVIDENCE. 

1642
01:01:51,173 --> 01:01:52,208
THEY ARE GOING CAUTIOUSLY AND 

1643
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,208
SLOWLY TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING 

1644
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,610
IS TAKEN CARE OF OUT HERE.  

1645
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,611
>> Reporter: THANK YOU VERY 

1646
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:55,811
MUCH. 

1647
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:58,848
LIVE AT YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, 

1648
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,283
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO 

1649
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,317
HOPEFULLY SOME MORE PEOPLE THAT 

1650
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,118
WERE INSIDE THAT AREA, 

1651
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,151
TERRIFYING STORIES. 

1652
01:02:03,151 --> 01:02:06,589
1700 PEOPLE WORK IN THAT 

1653
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:06,856
BUILDING. 

1654
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,991
AUNDREA SAID SOME PEOPLE SAID IT

1655
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,058
SOUNDED LIKE BALLOONS POPPING. 

1656
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:11,093
OTHERS KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT 

1657
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:15,965
WAS THE SHOOTER AND THAT'S THE 

1658
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,366
CLIMATE THAT WE ARE IN AT THIS 

1659
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:18,601
POINT WITH THE NUMBER OF MASS 

1660
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,036
SHOOTINGS GOING ON ACROSS THE 

1661
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,406
U.S. RECENTLY. AT THIS POINT, 

1662
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,273
THE SEARCH CONTINUES AS WE TAKE 

1663
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:25,474
A WIDER VIEW RIGHT NOW FROM 

1664
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,143
CHOPPER 5 OF THIS YOUTUBE 

1665
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,345
CAMPUS IN SAN BRUNO. IT'S 

1666
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,346
LARGELY AN INDUSTRIAL AREA WITH 

1667
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:35,251
A LOT OF OFFICES. ON THE 

1668
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,485
OUTSIDE, AS YOU COULD SEE, A 

1669
01:02:36,485 --> 01:02:37,486
LOT OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS, LOTS 

1670
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:39,121
OF HOMES IN THAT AREA. 

1671
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:44,794
THE STREETS ARE SHUT DOWN. 

1672
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:45,862
THERE'S A LOT OF LAW 

1673
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:46,496
ENFORCEMENT, FEDERAL AGENCIES 

1674
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:51,868
SUCH AS THE ATF THERE AS WELL. 

1675
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,236
THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS 

1676
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:53,603
INVESTIGATION. 

1677
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,939
>> AS YOU MENTIONED, SEVERAL úE 

1678
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,374
TERRIFYING TO HEAR SHOTS FIRED 

1679
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:00,443
AT THEIR PLACE OF WORK. 

1680
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,644
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT SOME OF 

1681
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,512
THE WITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED.  

1682
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:04,680
>> I DIDN'T HEAR ANY SHOTS. 

1683
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:11,087
I THINK THEY WERE FIRED WHILE I 

1684
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:11,987
WAS STILL IN THE BUILDING. 

1685
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:13,422
I WORK IN THE MIDSECTION OF THE 

1686
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:13,823
BUILDING. 

1687
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:14,891
IF SHOTS WERE FIRED, I WOULDN'T 

1688
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:15,658
HAVE HEARD IT'S.  

1689
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:16,893
>> Reporter: AND YOU SAID IT 

1690
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:17,894
WAS SOMEONE WITH AN ASSAULT 

1691
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:18,127
WEAPON? 

1692
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,395
TO MAKE SOMEBODY ELSE SAID HE 

1693
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:19,962
HAD A PISTOL. 

1694
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:26,202
I AM NOT SURE. 

1695
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,203
I NEVER SAW THE GUN. 

1696
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:28,271
I CAN'T CONFIRM ANYTHING ABOUT 

1697
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:29,338
THE WEAPON THAT HE HAD. 

1698
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,473
ALL I CAN CONFIRM IS SOMEONE 

1699
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,774
APPEAR TO HAVE A BULLET WOUND 

1700
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:32,909
IN HIS STOMACH AND HE WAS 

1701
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,510
LAYING ON THE OUTSIDE COURTYARD 

1702
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:40,850
AND WASN'T MOVING.  

1703
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:41,918
>> Reporter: WHAT KIND OF 

1704
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:42,885
SECURITY DOES YOUTUBE HAVE?  

1705
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:43,920
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, THE 

1706
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,954
INFORMATION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 

1707
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:46,155
IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM 

1708
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:46,956
WHAT HE JUST MENTIONED. 

1709
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,157
HE'S DEALING WITH THIS IN THE 

1710
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:48,991
HEAT OF THE MOMENT. 

1711
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,192
THE POLICE CHIEF DID SAY THAT 

1712
01:03:50,192 --> 01:03:51,661
THERE WAS A FEMALE WHO ENDED UP 

1713
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,128
DEAD FROM A GUNSHOT WOUND, SELF-

1714
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:55,731
INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. 

1715
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,134
THREE VICTIMS, PEOPLE THAT WERE 

1716
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,369
ALSO SHOT IN THAT AREA. THEY 

1717
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:05,841
HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT THERE 

1718
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:07,043
MAY OR MAY NOT BE ANOTHER 

1719
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:07,310
SHOOTER. 

1720
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,477
THEY HAVE NOT ELIMINATED THE 

1721
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,912
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE 

1722
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,113
SOMEONE ELSE INVOLVED IN ALL OF 

1723
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:11,346
THIS. 

1724
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:13,049
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOW GOING 

1725
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,850
TO GO THROUGH EVERY DOOR, 

1726
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:19,855
CLOSET, OFFICE, IN THIS MASSIVE 

1727
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:20,890
COMPLEX, TO CLEAR THAT AREA. 

1728
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,993
THEY WANT THE EMPLOYEES OUT AND 

1729
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,361
SAVE, BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO 

1730
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,562
CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS 

1731
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,563
OVER, WHETHER OR NOT THAT 

1732
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:28,664
PERSON WHO DIED FROM THE SELF-

1733
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:29,565
INFLICTED WOUND WAS THE ONLY 

1734
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,033
SHOOTER INVOLVED OR NOT. 

1735
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:35,638
AT THIS MOMENT, THAT IS WHAT WE 

1736
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:35,871
KNOW. 

1737
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:38,174
THREE VICTIMS, AT A LOCAL 

1738
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,709
HOSPITAL, AND ONE PERSON, A 

1739
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:45,381
FEMALE DEAD FROM A SELF-

1740
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,348
THEY ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER 

1741
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:47,450
OR NOT THAT WAS THE ONLY 

1742
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:51,153
SHOOTER INVOLVED OR IF THAT IN 

1743
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,221
FACT WAS THE SHOOTER.  

1744
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,356
>> AND THE THREE PEOPLE THAT 

1745
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:56,859
WERE SHOT WERE TAKEN TO SAN 

1746
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:57,493
FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. 

1747
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:58,426
ONE IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION 

1748
01:04:58,426 --> 01:04:59,962
AND ONE IS IN SERIOUS 

1749
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,063
CONDITION. 

1750
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:05,133
ONE'S CONDITION IS UNKNOWN 

1751
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:05,568
RIGHT NOW. 

1752
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,902
AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND, FOUR 

1753
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:08,337
PEOPLE WERE SHOT THIS AFTERNOON 

1754
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:08,971
AT YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. 

1755
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,373
NOW THEY ARE MENTIONING THE 

1756
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,506
SEARCH THAT'S ONGOING. 

1757
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:21,884
CHIEF ED BARBERINI DISCUSSED 

1758
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,018
THIS AND SAID IT WAS A 

1759
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:24,320
MONUMENTAL TASK AS THEY TRY TO 

1760
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,254
CLEAR THE BUILDING AND MAKE 

1761
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,255
SURE THERE IS NO PRESENT 

1762
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:26,488
DANGER. 

1763
01:05:26,488 --> 01:05:27,923
AS FOR ONE OF THE PEOPLE TAKEN 

1764
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:29,358
AWAY, THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY 

1765
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,526
VIDEOS THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED ON 

1766
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:30,960
SNAPCHAT. 

1767
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,261
THIS WOMAN POSTING AFTER SELF 

1768
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,129
EVACUATING. 

1769
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,530
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HEAR HER 

1770
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,631
VOICE RIGHT NOW BUT YOU ARE 

1771
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:36,832
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER 

1772
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,034
VIDEOS WE HAVE SEEN COMING IN. 

1773
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:41,070
AS FOR THE PEOPLE, AS I WAS 

1774
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:41,937
SAYING, THAT WERE EVACUATED 

1775
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:42,938
FROM THE BUILDING, THEY ARE 

1776
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:43,939
BEING PUT INTO GROUPS, PATTED 

1777
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:45,174
DOWN TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T 

1778
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,376
HAVE ANY WEAPONS ON THEM, AND 

1779
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,944
AT THAT POINT LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1780
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:53,048
ARE DECIDING IF THEY WERE 

1781
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,083
SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY ARE GOING 

1782
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,584
TO HAVE VIABLE INFORMATION IN 

1783
01:05:55,584 --> 01:06:02,959
THIS INVESTIGATION. 

1784
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:03,859
THOSE PEOPLE WILL THEN BE 

1785
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:04,794
SEPARATED AND INTERVIEWED AS 

1786
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,561
PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION. 

1787
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:06,728
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MASSIVE 

1788
01:06:06,728 --> 01:06:07,296
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. 

1789
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,330
AT THIS POINT, LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1790
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,565
DOESN'T WANT TO LET ANYBODY GET 

1791
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:10,966
AWAY OR GET OUT OF THAT AREA 

1792
01:06:10,966 --> 01:06:12,301
BEFORE POSSIBLY GETTING SOME 

1793
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,436
INFORMATION FOR THIS 

1794
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:13,803
INVESTIGATION. 

1795
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:14,603
<u>OU ARE DEALING  </u>

1796
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:15,404
ENFORCEMENT ON SEVERAL LEVELS 

1797
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,372
WERE HERE. 

1798
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:17,673
THE CITY OF BRUNO, THE COUNTY, 

1799
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:22,111
THE STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENTS, 

1800
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,379
RIGHT NOW ALL ON SCENE TRYING 

1801
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:24,380
TO COORDINATE THE RESPONSE TO 

1802
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,381
WHAT IS STILL BEING DESCRIBED 

1803
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,182
AS AN ACTIVE INCIDENT AT 

1804
01:06:27,182 --> 01:06:31,887
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. IT IS 

1805
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,689
PRETTY EASY TO JUDGE FROM THE 

1806
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,791
POLICE CHIEF'S TONE THAT HE 

1807
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:36,559
DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY 

1808
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:43,866
APPARENT DANGER AT THIS POINT. 

1809
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,634
HE JUST SAID HE ISN'T AVAILABLE 

1810
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:46,769
-- ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE 

1811
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:47,503
POSSIBILITY.  

1812
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:54,510
>> AND MULTIPLE SHOTS WERE 

1813
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:54,743
HEARD. 

1814
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:55,845
WE NOW KNOW THAT FOUR VICTIMS 

1815
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,712
WERE INVOLVED IN THIS. 

1816
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:58,647
THREE OF THEM ARE BEING TREATED 

1817
01:06:58,647 --> 01:06:59,515
AT THE HOSPITAL. 

1818
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,516
THIS WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE A 

1819
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,917
LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF. 

1820
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:07,490
FOR SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE 

1821
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,491
LOVED ONES WORKING AT THE 

1822
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:09,291
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, THEY WANT 

1823
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,693
TO KNOW WHO THE VICTIMS ARE, IF 

1824
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,760
THE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS ARE 

1825
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,128
DOING OKAY. 

1826
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,128
WE HAVE HEARD THAT TEMPERANCE 

1827
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,396
IS THE GENERAL WILL PROVIDE AN 

1828
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:15,931
UPDATE AT 330 THIS AFTERNOON, 

1829
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:16,832
AN UPDATE ON THE VICTIMS. 

1830
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,033
RIGHT NOW IT DOES APPEAR THAT 

1831
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:19,601
THE THREE VICTIMS WERE SHOT ARE 

1832
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:20,602
BEING TREATED. HOPEFULLY, THEY 

1833
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:23,439
WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND THOSE 

1834
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,440
DOCTORS ARE WORKING TO MAKE 

1835
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,909
SURE THAT THEY SURVIVE THIS. 

1836
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,944
RIGHT NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT 

1837
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:34,883
NOW, AT SOME OF THE ENTRANCES, 

1838
01:07:34,883 --> 01:07:35,885
THERE ARE SEVERAL DOORWAYS TO 

1839
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:36,886
ACCESS THIS BUILDING AND THEY 

1840
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,921
HAVE TO CLEAR IT ALL OUT AND 

1841
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,523
MAKE SURE THAT THIS HAS ENDED, 

1842
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:41,957
THAT THE SHOOTER IS IN FACT THE 

1843
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,993
PERSON WHO WAS FOUND DEAD FROM 

1844
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:47,830
A SELF INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. 

1845
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:59,241
THEY HAVE NOT ELIMINATED THE 

1846
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,275
POSSIBILITY OF THERE BEING MORE 

1847
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:00,509
PEOPLE. 

1848
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,410
THEY ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR 

1849
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:01,910
SOMEONE ELSE. 

1850
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:02,845
EMPLOYEES IN THAT AREA, OF 

1851
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:03,879
COURSE, ARE CALMLY WALKING OUT 

1852
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,381
AS WE HAD BEEN NOTICING FROM 

1853
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,548
OUR CHOPPER 5 LIVE LOOK. 

1854
01:08:06,548 --> 01:08:08,250
>>CALMLY IS ALL RELATIVE. 

1855
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:18,928
AS YOU LOOK AT THIS VIEW OF THE 

1856
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:19,995
YOUTUBE CAMPUS, IT'S VERY CLOSE 

1857
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,430
TO 280 AND 380 IN SAN BRUNO. 

1858
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,564
A LOT OF STREETS ARE CLOSED 

1859
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:23,432
DOWN IN THAT AREA. 

1860
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,599
CONTINUE TO AVOID A RIAZ POLICE 

1861
01:08:24,599 --> 01:08:25,634
WORK THROUGH THEIR 

1862
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:26,468
INVESTIGATION ON THE SCENE. 

1863
01:08:26,468 --> 01:08:27,670
