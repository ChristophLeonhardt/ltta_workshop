this lounge is for our premium guests about our business class first class and residence passes the size allowed at 7,500 square foot so expect big lounge 3 glad we can accommodate 132 people in this lounge and I think something that really stands out about this lounge is the centerpiece which is the bar as you see and you get a scent here you don't really feel as though you're in an airport lounge all over course the aircraft in the background does give it away but it feels more like a a trendy Manhattan bar and that's the sort of the look and feel that we've gone for and in terms of some of the other amenities that we have here we have a hot and cold buffet that's available plus as well we have a restaurant area here that the fine dining serving that we have an a la carte menu for the food that we provide and also a boutique wine list as well is exactly the same as what you find on board so we're all about providing a seamless service and it's about providing luxury or not only in the air but also on the ground as well so basically this lounge is 500 square feet so it's pretty sizeable sort of a lot bigger than a New York apartment of course we have the seating area here a large TV we have of course the dining is set up so guests can actually die before they get on the aircraft as well I know people are going to spend a lot of time here so what else can we do apart from eat problems I can eat they can relax obviously we also have a prayer room okay and also as well an ensuite bathroom and shower as well and in addition to that we have a separate entrance we've come through the secret door that leads you in through the main lounge but in addition to that we have a private entrance because I'm sure you can appreciate many of our residents packages expect alarm for the privacy so they actually have their own entrance in and out of here as well
