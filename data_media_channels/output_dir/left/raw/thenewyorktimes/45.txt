1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,560
What if plants could count?

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,670
The Venus flytrap can —

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,010
in a way.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,750
It’s carnivorous and
it waits for an insect

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,890
to fall in its trap and
trip its trigger hairs.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,010
Each time a hair is disturbed,
an electrical signal

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,620
travels along cell surfaces.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,380
Scientists wired a
flytrap with electrodes

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,440
so they could see this
process in action.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,750
Each flick produced
an electric signal

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,910
called an action potential.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,270
It took two flicks within
a space of 20 seconds

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,140
to make the trap
snap shut.

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,910
And more than three flicks

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,510
to start up
the cells that

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,970
make the digestive enzymes
in dissolving the prey.

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,060
And the more times a
frenetic, struggling victim

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,480
trips a trigger hair,
the more such juices flow.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:00,000
Now that’s a smart plant.
