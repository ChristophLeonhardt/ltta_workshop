♪ ♪ Greg: STARTING IN JULY, AMERICAN AIRLINES WILL BAN FERRETS, HEDGEHOGS, AND GOATS FROM THEIR PLANES. WE WENT TO A GOAT FOR COMMENT. A HUGE INCREASE IN SERVICE ANIMALS ONCE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL ISSUES, PEOPLE WITH PTSD, DISABILITIES. NOW IT IS BEING TRIED BY ANYONE WANTING TO TAKE THEIR CRITTER ALONG FOR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. YOU HAVE SOMEONE DRAGGING A PEACOCK ON A PLANE WHICH TURNS A THERAPY TOOL INTO A JOKE. THIS IS NOT REALLY ABOUT PEACOCKS. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE. WHENEVER SOMETHING IS DESIGNED TO HELP YOU COME OTHER PEOPLE ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. YOU CREATE A COOL PRODUCT. SOMEONE COUNTERFEITED. YOU INVENT A DRUG THAT KILLS PAIN AND IT BECOMES PARTY FAVOR. SOMETHING GOOD ALWAYS GETS HIJACKED BY HUMANS WHO MAY NOT NEED IT AT ALL. SUPPORT ANIMALS ARE NO DIFFERENT. PEOPLE GAME THE SYSTEM, SOMETIMES EVEN WITH GAME, KIMBERLY, WHICH MAKES IT HARD FOR REAL PATIENTS. IF YOU ARE APPLYING FOR SERVICE ANIMAL DOCUMENTATION AND YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT BECAUSE YOU ARE CAPTAIN SNUGGLES NEAR YOU AND YOU ARE NOT A VETERAN OR A VICTIM OF ACCIDENT OR ILLNESS, YOU ARE NOT BEING COOL. THIS IS COMING FROM A BONA FIDE SERVICE ANIMAL. IT'S TRUE. I'M WILLING TO TRAVEL ANYWHERE, PROVIDE COMFORT FOR YOU FOR THE RIGHT PRICE, A BAD, AND A FREE MEAL. CALL ME. I FIT UNDER THE SEAT. Jesse: WERE YOU AT THE PROM? Greg: I WAS AT THE PROM. Dana: YOU WILL HAVE SO MANY OFFERS. Greg: THAT IS A GREAT SONG. I WILL BE YOUR COMFORT ANIMAL. Kimberly: THE MONEY THING. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. Greg: WHY DON'T AIRPLANES CREATE SEPARATE COMFORT CABINS FOR PETS. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PUT THEIR PETS IN THE BAGGAGE AREA. WHAT IF ONE INDUSTRY SAID WE HAVE THIS AREA THAT CAN HOLD 20 PETS. Dana: THEY ARE ALL GOING TO FIGHT. Jesse: YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY NEVER FLOWN COMMERCIAL. THERE IS NO ROOM IN AIRPLANES. YOU CAN'T HAVE A SEPARATE SECTION. MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO LEGROOM. Greg: THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME. Kimberly: AND NOW IT'S EVEN CLOSER DISTANCE IN YOUR NEEDS ARE UP TO HERE. IT'S NOT GOOD. Greg: JUAN, WOULD YOU EVER BRING A THERAPY PET? Kimberly: HE NEEDS TO BRING ONE TO THE SET EVERY DAY. Juan: FUNNY, FUNNY. I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WOULD BE ABSENT AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED WITH THIS. YOUR LEGISLATION. RICHARD SHELBY RICHARD SHELBY. Dana: THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T. SO FAR COMPANIES ARE DOING IT THEMSELVES. THIS IS AN AMERICAN AIRLINES. Juan: RICHARD BURR OF NORTH CAROLINA SO I AM THICK ENOUGH. HE HAS SOME LEGISLATION THAT SAYS IT HAS TO BE A SERVICE ANIMAL. Dana: TRYING TO PROTECT VETERANS OR PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEEDED. I HAVE A QUESTION, GREG. EXCLUDING MINIATURE HORSES PROPERLY TRAINED AS SERVICE ANIMALS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE POTTY TRAINED. Kimberly: HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? Greg: THEY DON'T HAVE POTTIES, DANA. YOU GREW UP ON A RANCH. YOU CAN'T POTTY TRAIN A HORSE. Kimberly: THIS IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL. Greg: THE SEGMENT OR THE IDEA? Jesse: IT IS LIKE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. IT STARTS OFF LEGIT AND YOU GO TO VENICE BEACH AND THEN THE DOCTOR COMES OUT WITH DREADLOCKS AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE THE SNIFFLES. Kimberly: PERSONAL ANECDOTE? Juan: WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE OF THESE ANIMALS ATTACKS YOU OR SOMEBODY SAYS I DON'T WANT TO SIT NEXT TO THEM. Greg: WHAT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO CATS AND YOU HAVE A THERAPY CAT? Dana: HOW WOULD YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO A PEACOCK? Greg: I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY. THE POINT IS YOU SHOULDN'T PUNISH THE PATIENT. WHEN PEOPLE GAME THE SYSTEM. Dana: KNOW A COUPLE WHO ARE
