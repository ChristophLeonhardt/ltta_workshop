when it comes to the Trump cabinet there is a new scandal tonight that I find almost impossible to believe maybe I'm naive maybe I should expect everything and nothing at the same time now but I really feel like this is jaw-dropping it was first reported by The Washington Post this afternoon but it's interesting the underlying evidence here the documents that gave rise to the story in The Washington Post were actually obtained a few weeks ago by the environmental group the Sierra Club the Sierra Club obtained a whole bunch of internal documents from the EPA since Scott Pruett has been the EPA Administrator and as you know there have been a million kajillion different scandals surrounding scott pruett since he has been EPA Administrator but set that aside for a second pretend you have never heard about any of those other scandals pretend you don't even really know Scott Pruitt's name pretend this is the first to have ever heard that there might be any negative reporting whatsoever concerning Scott Pruett and his time as a cabinet official even if this was it even if this was the only negative news story that had ever broken about him just ask yourself if you think it seems feasible that he still has this job tonight after this was reported this afternoon so it's a simple story Scott Pruett got sworn in to be head of the EPA in February last year February 2017 then March April May three months later may 2017 an official working for Scott Pruett at the EPA sent this email from Sydney hub at epa.gov to Dan caffee at chick-fil-a which is the fast food chicken place season if he's a an executive at chick-fil-a subject meeting with EPA Administrator Scott Pruett good afternoon mister Cathy hopefully this email finds you well administrator Pruitt asked me to reach out to you and see if you might be willing to get a time set up for the two of you to have a meeting if there is something I can work with to help get that facility if there's someone I can work with to help get that facilitated I would greatly appreciate it so this is an executive at an American fast-food company getting notice from somebody works at the EPA sending an email from their epa.gov email address sending an official note that the head of the EPA wants a meeting so this guy responds within an hour yes yes I'll take the meeting he assigns a staffer to set it up the staffer responds Sydney thank you for reaching out to schedule a conversation between Dan and administrator Pruitt please let me know about any background or advance information on the visit in case Stan would like to invite another member of our team to join looking forward to coordinating with you further that was sent from that the chick-fil-a offices in Atlanta and this EPA official writes back hi oven the administrator didn't mention a specific time but I'll touch base with them to see if there is one what are some good times in the coming weeks that look good for mister Cathy now all of these emails are going back and forth in the middle of the day on weekdays this is work day work this is an EPA official trying to set up these meetings as part of her official duties as somebody who works at the Environmental Protection Agency having her salary paid by you and I chick-fil-a rights back to her Sydney thank you again for coordinating further with administrator Pruitt I will engage further our direct our director for regulatory and government affairs has rescheduled time thank you for your assistance so at this point they're bringing in further executives from the company now to be involved with with the head of the EPA who has requested this meeting with their company so now all these executives from the chick-fil-a company are involved in trying to organize this meeting to figure out what the head of this cabinet agency wants to talk about figuring out who needs to be there from their company in order to take this important meeting with this very high-ranking government official and it's at this point after a few more back-and-forth emails that this official at the EPA who's trying to set up this EPA meeting for Scott Pruett she finally clarifies at least a little bit as to what exactly this is all about quote apologies for missing your call yesterday the administrator would like to talk about a potential business opportunity with mr. Cathy and that's what this has all been about why is the head of the EPA on official business summoning executives from this fast-food company because he says he wants to talk about a potential business opportunity well we'll let the Washington Post pick up the story from their quote the call with chick-fil-a was arranged then cancelled then Pruitt eventually did speak with someone from the company's legal department only then did he reveal the potential business opportunity that was on his mind the potential business opportunity his staffer had referred to was a job for Scott Pruitt's wife a representative for the chick-fil-a company tells The Washington Post via email quote the subject of that phone call was an expression of interest and his wife becoming a chick-fil-a franchisee even if you had never heard of any of the other scandals afflicting Scott Pruitt any of the other ethics disasters and the conflicts of interest and corruption scandals around scott pruett since he has been in trumps cabinet even if the only thing you know was that he had EPA staff set up a meeting for him with officials from chick-fil-a so he could try to get his wife a chick-fil-a store you would assume that he would be fired by now right you could assume that he would be fired by the time that this story was in print this afternoon because as soon as somebody had to ask the White House for comment about this you would expect that that member of the cabinet would be gone especially because in this case this is not even contested information these emails these multiple emails are at least a dozen of them back and forth where EPA staff are trying to arrange meetings and calls using their epa.gov email addresses on weekdays during the day directly on behalf of Scott Pruitt we we've got the actual emails there's been no suggestion from Scott Pruitt that these emails are not real the EPA handed them over as part of a four-year request they're not denying the veracity of these emails on the other side of it chick-fil-a the company that was shaken down here I mean approached by this cabinet official in this way the company is confirming that yeah this federal employee called on behalf of this cabinet officer trying to get his wife a job it is against the law for a public official to use his or her job or the staff that support that job for the private gain of that public official use of public office for private gain section two 6:35 point 702 an employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain or for the private gain of friends relatives relatives or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a non-governmental capacity that's illegal you can't I mean even if this was it this is Scott Pruett trying to get his wife a chick-fil-a franchise right even if this had been Scott Pruett sending the CPA staffer out to get his wife a chick-fil-a sandwich that itself would be illegal under federal law because in addition to not being allowed to use your public office for private gain you also cannot have federal employees do personal favors for a public official and his or her family its bluntly illegal there have been very large public scandals about much lower profile public officials and other presidencies / behavior that was not nearly this blatant or this unassailably proven and it's ridiculous at one level on the other hand a chick-fil-a franchisee is a valuable thing the company says something like 40,000 people approached the company every year inquiring about becoming a chick-fil-a franchise owner of the 40,000 people who asked about that the company only chooses about 100 people to get a franchise per year people who want to become a chick-fil-a franchise owner know that it is a very very competitive thing there's an online application I mean you're you're not supposed to have a federal cabinet official have federal government employees call to get you to the front of the line you're supposed to fill out the online application and then beg and plead and make your best case to chick-fil-a 40,000 people apply a hundred get it but in this case Scott Pruett just had his staff call and butt-nik apparently he didn't follow through back to the Washington Post quote Marlin Pruett who was scott Pruitt's wife never ended up opening a chick-fil-a restaurant according to a representative of the company quote administrator Pruitt's wife started but did not complete the chick-fil-a franchisee application yeah I bet it was hard much easier to just have one of Scott Pruett staffers call and get your meeting down at headquarters I mentioned that it's a cabinet official who's calling who's requesting this meeting officially whatever you think of chick-fil-a whatever you think of everything else you have heard about Scott Pruett on the basis of this reporting alone how is it possible that he is still in office between the company's statement acknowledging that this is what he was asking for and the emails that are now published showing that he was having EPA staff asked for this on his behalf this just seems like very blunt textbook evidence of very overt for middle behavior on the behalf on the behalf of the administrator on the behalf of this member of the cabinet I mean what's the defense here I was kidding setting aside the issue of whether or not Scott Pruett will ever be prosecuted for this how is it possible that Congress has not lit up like a firework show over this blatant abuse of office I mean the obvious answer of course is that Congress right now is republican-controlled and so when it comes to behavior like this by Trump administration officials they just don't want to know even so it does seem like Scott Pruett might even be pushing it with Republicans Iowa Senator Joni Ernst is one of a number of farm state Republicans who are upset with Scott Pruett anyway because that she says Scott Pruett lied to her about the renewable fuel standard which is an important thing for Iowa farmers beyond that though she sounded today like she was starting to get a little fed up with the ostentatious grift part of what Scott Pruett is doing at that agency as well I will remain highly critical of administrator Pruitt because not only do we disagree on the RFS but there are a number of other transgressions that we have seen coming out of that office directly tied to administrative Pruett and the way he spends money the way he misuses basically his office my words nobody else's but he is about as swampy as you get here in Washington DC and if the president wants to drain the swamp he needs to take a look at his own cabinet he is about as swampy as you get Iowa Senator Joni Ernst Republican senator calling on President Trump essentially to fire EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt today she said part of as part of her remarks today that it's up to the president but that essentially she hopes that he fires him and in part that is about farm state senators being mad about what Scott Pruett is doing concerning renewable fuel standards but in part it's also about every new scandal including today's absolutely unbelievable chick-fil-a grift watch what happened when NBC's Garrett Haake today spoke with Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe about this same guy and ask you about your fellow Oklahomans Scott Pruett I know a lot of the ethanol state Republicans are upset with him about these renewable fuel standards are you satisfied with the way he's doing his job from your perspective well there's I thought you were going to ask you about the most recent we can do that first we talked about that yeah I don't know that that's true let's be specific on what we're talking about this is emails that he was trying to essentially help his wife get a franchise with chick-fil-a if that is true that is not going to be served in his advantage and it would not be a good thing I the problem is I've known him for so long and I just can't see him doing something like that so I'm going to assume that it's not true I'm gonna I'm gonna assume that it's not true you know it looks like it's true these are the real emails where EPA staff really is working at the EPA on government time to try to get Scott Pruitt hooked up with chick-fil-a and we really do have an on-the-record statement from chick-fil-a saying what that was about was him trying to get a franchise for his wife so it's true senator Huff again saying he's deciding to assume that it is not true it's true and it's illegal bluntly illegal and it is therefore awkward for Republicans and Congress to not want to do anything about it the only way that is likely to change of course is if it is no longer a republican-controlled Congress hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC
