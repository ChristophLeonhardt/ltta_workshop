HOWIE: PRESIDENT TRUMP THROWING A BODY BLOCK AT LE BRON JAMES AFTER THE NBA STAR SAID THIS. IT'S A NEW SPORT TO DIVIDE. THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T RELATE TO. HOWIE: TRUMP TWEETED LE BRON JAMES WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE DUMBEST MAN ON TELEVISION, DON LEMON, BAN HE MADE LE BRON LOOK SMART. IS IT SMART TO BE BRAWLING WITH AN NBA STAR? MOLLIE: PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO SEE THE PRESIDENT GO AFTER ATHLETES AND THEY DON'T LIKE ATHLETES TO GO AFTER THE PRESIDENT. HE GAVE IT TO DON LEMON. THE MEDIA AND SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES ONLY FOCUSED ON WHAT HE SAID ABOUT LE BRON. HOWIE: LE BRON SAYS WHO IS THE REAL DUMMY, SOMEONE WHO PUTS KIDS IN CAGES. CAPRI: DON LEMON IS ALWAYS RESISTING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP EVERY NIGHT ON CNN. TO TRUMP. PEOPLE PRAISE DONALD TRUMP FOR SAYING IF HE HAS HIS BACK UP AGAINST THE WALL, HE'LL FIGHT BACK. THAT'S WHAT DON LEMON DID. HOWIE: MELANIA TRUMP SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE LE BRON JAMES IS WORKING TO DO GOOD THINGS. THE FIRST LADY ENCOURAGES THAT. "NEW YORK TIMES" PUBLISHER A.G. SULZBERGER HAS AN OFF-THE-RECORD MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THEN SULZBERGER PUSHES BACK. THE FACT THAT HE HAD THIS MEETING DOES IT SUGGEST HE CARES GILLIAN: THE MORE IMPORTANT THING WITH THIS MEETING IS IT UNDERSCORES WHAT I LOVE TO TALK. WITH REGARD TO FOREIGN POLICY. HE BELIEVES FERVENTLY IN THE POWER OF HIS INTERPERSONAL SKILLS. IF HE CAN JUST GET THESE PEOPLE HOWIE: I HAVE SEEN HIM DO THAT. SULD DULDS BERGER SAID HE WARNED THAT IT'S LEADING TO THREATS AGAINST JOURNALISTS AND WILL LEAD TO VIOLENCE. THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENCE, THE MEDIA NEEDS TO BE THINKING ABOUT THEIR INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC AGAINST REPUBLICANS. WE HAVE SEEN SHOOTINGS OF CONGRESSMEN AND PEOPLE GETTING ARRESTED. I THINK PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS AND YOU CAN'T BLAME THE RHETORIC. HE SAYS DONALD TRUMP'S RHETORIC IS DANGEROUS AND DIVISIVE. THIS WEEK THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HIRED SARAH JEONG AND NECESSITY TESTIFIED IT AS IF IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT COMES BACK WITH A SERIES OF TWEETS. WHEN THE MEDIA DRIVEN INSANE BY THEIR TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, IT PUTS THE LIVES OF JOURNALISTS AT RISK. VERY UNPATRIOTIC. REVEALING THE SECRETS OF GOVERNMENT HAS GONE ON SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE REPUBLIC. CAPRI: I SUSPECT WE'LL CONTINUE HIS TWEETS. THE FACT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE NEW YORK TIMES. WHO DO WE TRUST ANSWER WHO DO WE BELIEVE IS TELLING THE TRUTH. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE "NEW YORK TIMES." HOWIE: IF IT'S THE EPA OR HHS.
