1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,215
LEGAL TEAM IN JANUARY SAID HE

2
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:03,783
DID DICTATE THE STATEMENT.

3
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:04,217
MARTHA?

4
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:04,684
>> Martha: OKAY.

5
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:06,052
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE FROM

6
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:07,954
THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT.

7
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,356
JUDGE NAPOLITANO JOINS US NOW.

8
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:10,790
JUDGE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

9
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,297
>> I THINK THAT THE LETTER WAS

10
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:18,832
A DISGRACE AND HARMFUL.

11
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:19,699
>> Martha: THE JANUARY MEM

12
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,100
ROW?

13
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,734
>> JANUARY MEMO.

14
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:23,470
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT OUT OR

15
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,504
WHY THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD LEAK

16
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:25,505
IT.

17
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:28,408
IT SHOWS SOPHOMORE RICK VIEW

18
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:31,011
OF -- SOPHOMORIC VIEW OF THE

19
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:31,278
LAW.

20
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,615
THEY CITED THE WRONG STATUTE.

21
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,317
THIS IS SAYING TWO THINGS.

22
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,818
THE PRESIDENT CANNOT COMMIT

23
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:40,020
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE BECAUSE

24
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,522
HE CAN ORDER ANYBODY

25
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:43,490
PROSECUTED OR FIRE ANYBODY HE

26
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:43,857
WANTS.

27
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,025
HE CAN.

28
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:46,960
BUT IF HE DOES SO FOR A

29
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,794
CORRUPT PURPOSE THAT WOULD BE

30
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:48,828
THE DEFINITION OF OBSTRUCTION

31
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:49,729
OF JUSTICE.

32
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:53,433
THEY FORGOT THAT PART.

33
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:55,135
THE SECOND ARGUMENT THEY MAKE

34
00:00:55,135 --> 00:01:00,006
HE CAN INTERFERE WITH THEFEIN

35
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:00,640
THEFEIN -- F.B.I.

36
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,074
INVESTIGATION.

37
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:03,643
BUT THAT IS NOT OBSTRUCTION.

38
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:06,012
BUT THAT WAS AMENDED 2002 TO

39
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:09,416
SAY IF IT INTENDED TO PRODUCE

40
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,483
EVIDENCE --

41
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,351
>> Martha: THESE ARE LAWYERS

42
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:11,985
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE

43
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:12,419
UNITED STATES.

44
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,287
YOU THINK HE HAS A GOOD LEGAL

45
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:14,621
TEAM.

46
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:16,122
NOW HE HAS RUDY GIULIANI AND

47
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:16,990
JAY SEKULOW.

48
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,625
>> IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO

49
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,260
CRITICIZE THEM BECAUSE I KNOW

50
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,494
THEM ALL PERSONALLY AND

51
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:22,362
INTERACTED WITH MANY.

52
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:23,663
JAY HERE AND OTHERS IN THE

53
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:24,731
OTHER ENVIRONMENTS.

54
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,099
>> Martha: SURE.

55
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,235
>> BUT THEY ARE NOT SERVING

56
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,770
HIM WELL WHEN THEY NEEDLESSLY

57
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,572
SHOW THEIR CARDS AND SAY HE

58
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:33,173
CAN IMPEACH HIMSELF.

59
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:34,407
WHY RAISE THE ISSUE?

60
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:35,275
RUDY GIULIANI --

61
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:37,410
>> Martha: HE COULD PARDON

62
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:37,977
HIMSELF.

63
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:41,614
>> A -- CORRECT.

64
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,850
A BRILLIANT PROSECUTOR SAYING

65
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,785
THAT HE COULD ORDER JAMES

66
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:47,020
COMEY SHOT IN THE OVAL OFFICE

67
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,922
AND NOT PROSECUTED FOR THAT?

68
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:53,226
THAT IS ABSURD AND VIOLATION

69
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:54,127
OF THE LAW.

70
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:59,699
HE COULD BE ARRESTED, TRIED,

71
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,368
RELEASED OR TRIED AFTER HE

72
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:01,968
LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE.

73
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,803
BUT NO ONE WOULD LET THE

74
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:05,071
ATTEMPTED MURDER OR MURDER NOT

75
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,005
TO BE CHARGED.

76
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,674
GIULIANI KNOWS THAT.

77
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:08,541
>> Martha: SHOULD HE FIRE

78
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,408
GIULIANI FOR THAT?

79
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:10,043
>> I DON'T KNOW.

80
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,044
THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OF

81
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:12,612
WHICH I'M UNFAMILIAR.

82
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,047
PERHAPS THE TRUMP WANTS RUDY

83
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:14,948
CAUSING THE CHAOS.

84
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:18,218
BUT HE IS CAUSING CHAOS AND HE

85
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,452
CAUSING PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME

86
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:20,620
AND THE COLLEAGUES HERE AND

87
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,956
ELSEWHERE TO TALK ABOUT THE

88
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,724
ABSURD OFF-THE-WALL THINGS

89
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:29,662
LIKE CAN THE PRESIDENT PARDON

90
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:30,230
HIMSELF?

91
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,564
>> Martha: THE 500th DAY

92
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:32,432
OF THE PRESIDENCY.

93
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:33,366
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ONE

94
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:33,900
TWEET ABOUT THAT.

95
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,102
HE FEELS HE GOT SO MUCH

96
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:37,103
ACCOMPLISHED BUT DID PROBABLY

97
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,405
NINE OR TEN OVER THE WEEKEND

98
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:39,606
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

99
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:40,707
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS MUCH OF

100
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,308
WHICH TO BE PROUD ON HIS

101
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,711
500th DAY IN OFFICE.

102
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:45,712
BUT WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD

103
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,113
PARDON HIMSELF IS NOT AMONG

104
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:47,447
THEM.

105
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:50,016
MOST RESPECTFULLY, IF BOB

106
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,217
MUELLER'S OFFICE IS

107
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:52,352
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WHY DID YOU

108
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:53,520
SANCTION THE RUSSIANS THAT HE

109
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,621
INDICTED AND WHY ARE YOU

110
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,523
LAWYERS INTERACTING WITH AN

111
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:58,858
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ENTITY?

112
00:02:58,858 --> 00:02:59,993
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER

113
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:00,427
WOULD BE.

114
00:03:00,427 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Martha: GOOD ARGUMENT.
