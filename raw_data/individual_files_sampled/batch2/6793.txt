France is looking to make cat calling a crime and fine offenders now on Monday October 16th Marlene Scapa Frances junior minister of gender equality said that France was exploring the idea of finding individuals for street sexual harassment and how much the fines would cost nasi Appa said the government was going to consult with professionals on the legalities of such a proposal and create workshops for citizens across the country now this all came about after Frances version of the hashtag me too but their hashtag was expose your Pig because France is awesome because it is awesome so you know they haven't they haven't you know obviously made this into law yet but they're looking into it and I don't know how it would be enforced right I mean presumably if you are being catcalled and you're on the street you know next to a man and you confront him that's a danger right or you know staying nearby and calling the police that's also a danger because you're presenting a physical danger for yourself so I'm not sure how this would work practically but I do think it's it's important to recognize that they're trying to take steps into the right direction legally a lot of this is covered in American law legally it should technically you're protected against this kind of behavior usually it's senator disturbing the peace statute New York for example I mean the wording of these are pretty hilarious but I mean they're strange it's like obscene language or gestures in public if they do it at least twice they are a lot they're up for a two hundred and fifty dollar fine and 15 days in jail Alaska Arizona Colorado Georgia Kentucky Minnesota and Pennsylvania it's illegal to follow people it's not illegal to cat call them or do what I just said happens in New York which is illegal but you can't follow people DC abusive language or conduct or disturbing a person's path so a lot of these places have this is nebulous idea so they're the laws on the books and a lot of places yeah but the you know the ability to then document that effectively go to police officer and tell them that's what happened that's another story yeah I think that's the question is like how do you operationalize these kinds of laws and I think there are other models for for kind of how to implement this I think Portugal has like some stuff on the books and Belgium so France has models to kind of frame this legislation around but again how do you do it I do think there is something to having these offences categorized under sexual harassment or sexual assault as opposed to you know because I think it creates you know a framework for kind of understanding that these are gender-based offences right like and I think Mike stigmatize some of the offenders and I wish I was a way to make it like public records oh you could like look up before you go on a date with someone how many times I make out goals like does everyone need a body here's my trip how do you exactly around and I you know in Iowa or in Hawaii it's like after you tell them to stop and they don't it's up there up for $1,000 and 30 days in prison here's my video from my body camera but guess what telling somebody to stop while you're on the street whether you're by yourself is a real danger like that's that's something that can be very like either if you're in an already an intimidating situation telling it like already having sort of that like precursor to the take the neck before you can get to the next step is problematic in itself because if I'm on the street and there's a man coming towards me who's probably got another hundred pounds on me you know what I mean was twice my size and he says something inappropriate to me and I don't necessarily see that I have a safety net of people around me with eyes or could hear me or whatever and I tell him to stop I'm putting myself in a really precarious situation yeah I think women learn to deescalate right as uncomfortable as those situations are we learn to deescalate for fear of you know violent encounters so I wonder like who would be trained like are cops supposed to intervene when they see this happening because I don't trust that at all cops that call me right looks like it yeah how do you operationalize this and whose yeah how do you train folks to kind of identify that it's happening is this something that we collectively do as citizens like dwelling it out yeah right now is a watershed moment hopefully in this all in that the Harvey Weinstein things in the zeitgeist today we covered two stories I hope it continues this way yeah the sad part about that is like well then we have to expose more and more stuff that has happened but I think collectively we all understand it happens a whole hell of a lot of course all the time multiple times on your street a day yeah ya know one of my favorite things that has come out of this like of the Harvey Weinstein things that more people are realizing how ubiquitous it is right like I've had guys me wait like I know guys that have been accused of this I'm like I know you may know that one guy but you probably know a lot more you just don't know that they do it yeah my guess is a big portion of your friends do it because it's so common the problem now one of the many problems is that with the woman with that thing we talked about in a previous story about representative Johnson is that the women are afraid and the guys aren't they aren't afraid of any consequence and there is no fear of consequence so whatever we need to do up I think the fear of consequence at the very least in addition to just raising people better that's gonna take so there's long term there's short term things we can do and and a renewed push in litigating against these kinds of things making sure they go through well there's so many people who are complicit in this who have let it go on for so long including our education secretary you know on college campuses right like this is a pervasive everywhere and it's not just the guys who are assaulting women it's it's you and your comments on the street right it's the little ways that you perpetuate it in the thoughts and the comments and the ways that you make women uncomfortable that you may not be aware of or that you actively may be aware of that you need to start to work on because that contributes to like men need to hold other men accountable for their behavior and I think would go a long way help us build independent media together come join us TYT Network comm / join
