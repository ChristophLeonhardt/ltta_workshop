Mexico's witnessed a tectonic shifted political landscape with a leftist outsider claiming victory in the presidential election he said profound change is now coming to the country or I guess DF has more now on the man who said it's set to take power and rey manuel lopez obrador o am low for short the new and somewhat colorful president of mexico a real underdog whose party morena and it almost a century of rule by two of Mexico's dominant political parties not bad huh and as is fashionable these days often justifiably amlo ain't exactly a fan of Trump we have to convince and persuade those Americans who are manipulated by Donald Trump's campaign of United States first or America first that's a fallacy it's nonsense that actually goes above the national limits of universal justice and fraternity now when I say not a fan I mean he really doesn't like Trump even wrote a book about it called wait Trump or listen Trump of course you can't have a proper election nowadays without a little the old Russian meddling or at least someone complaining about it actually initial signs of it in the Mexican presidential campaign already is an aspect where we want to confront destabilizer behavior with with Russia as we know that Russia has fingerprints in a number of elections around the world my advice would be to Mexico would be pay attention pay attention to what's happening even in Mexico and a blow to his credit found it really funny I'm just here watching the weather waiting for the Russian submarine to come with my people and with golf from Moscow his supporters even made a jacket for him with the word man you any which on it get it and Ray Manuel Manuel which sounds kind of Russian to his credit he even wore it be it his dislike of Trump sense of humor ooh whatever else he swept the election preliminary results he got more than half the vote his rivals eating the dust to be fair he's had some practice it's his third attempt at presidency bit of a sore loser though when he lost the election in 2006 he staged a fake inauguration party for himself never mind that good practice for the real thing congratulations mr. Manuel ovitch Vladimir Putin sends his regards you
