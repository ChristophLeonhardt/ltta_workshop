9% a Republican ran for Senator in California the state once governed by Ronald Reagan a Republican ran for Senator in California and last night as a representative of Donald Trump's Republican Party in California the Republican running for Senate in California got nine percent of the vote could not get into double digits nine percent of the vote the Republican was crushed by incumbent Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein who won 44 percent of the vote in the open primary in November she will face another Democrat a state senator Kevin de Leon who got 11 percent of the vote the Republican Party got wiped out in the Senate race in California no Republican has ever done worse running for Senate in California and what has senator Feinstein been doing during the Trump presidency investigating Donald Trump on the Senate Intelligence Committee and investigating Donald Trump and his administration on the Senate Judiciary Committee and as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee she had that memorable moment in the Cabinet Room when she got Donald Trump to follow her lead and abandoned the Republicans in join Dianne Feinstein on daca what about a clean daca bill now I have no I think that's basically what dick is saying we're going to come up with daca we're gonna do daca and then we can start immediately on the Phase two which would be comprehensive we think a lot of people would like to see them but I think we have to do nothing the Republicans then rushed to get Donald Trump back on the leash and they did they pulled him back to the Republican side and of course nothing has happened on daca but California spoke last night on what is now the two-year battle between Dianne Feinstein and Donald Trump and Donald Trump lost very very badly Democratic lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom came out the front-runner in the governor's race he will face Republican John Cox in the November election and today President Trump tweeted he can win about John Cox about the Republican running for governor to which Gavin Newsom replied please come campaign for him as much as possible we are patiently awaiting Donald Trump's response to Gavin Newsom tweet and silent so far up next I'll ask Ron Klain what will happen in California if Donald Trump does actually dare go out to California to campaign against Gavin Newsom or engaged in an epic battle and it looks like voters will have a real choice this November between a governor who's gonna stand up to Donald Trump and a foot soldier in his war on California and Ron Klain is back with us and and Ron Gavin Newsom is now taunting Donald Trump saying please come out to California and campaign against me that would be the best thing that could happen to my campaign yeah well I think this campaigns a good shape either way but I do think if Trump goes out to the campaign we should expect a big flu epidemic because every Republican running for every office in the state is gonna be sick in at home that day and be nowhere near Donald Trump when he's campaigning in this state I mean it's amazing Lords you and I are old enough to remember when California was a Republican state had Republican governors Republican senators that last night the Republicans were essentially a third party in California there are eight rate Senate congressional races where no Republican will be on the ballot in the fall no Republican in the Senate race and senator Feinstein won a Dunning win last night not as the most liberal or the youngest candidate for the US Senate but as a strongly anti-trump candidate that's a strong message people willing to get behind her because she's standing up to Donald Trump and and Ron the the idea that the Republican candidate for Senate in California could not get into double digits 9% in California for Senate yeah I mean it really is kind of stunning and I think it just shows that Trump has attacked California and Californians are voting and what they're voting on is that they don't like President Trump they don't think he's heading the country right direction they think that the kind of policies that senator Feinstein's standing for in the Senate Governor Jerry Brown in the state now he is lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom that's the direction the country should go in about policies that are inclusive policies are building of the economy for the future policies that are protecting the environment fighting climate change you know Californians are casting a vote and that vote is know to Trump notice what Trump stands for a big yes for the Democrats Ron Klain thank you once again really appreciate it thanks Lawrence thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
