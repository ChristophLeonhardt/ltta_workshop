how do you motivate yourself to work in a direction that you think will be most fruitful for the task at hand I have a colleague who defeats the problem of procrastination associated with writing we always are reluctant to begin writing on a big project because writing is a difficult thing to do but I have a colleague who figured out a way to do it when she is writing on a particular task and she knows what she's going to say at the end of that of that particular statement or paragraph or even sentence she stops herself and she doesn't let herself complete that paragraph or sentence and that makes her eager to get back to it the next day so that she can finish that particular statement that she's making and now she's back in her chair writing away and the the task continues on it flows forward I thought it was brilliant I started using it on myself and it works
