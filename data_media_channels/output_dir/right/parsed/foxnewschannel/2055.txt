IS.
STEVE: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
ASSEMBLED A DREAM TEAM TO
HELP GET AMERICA INTO SHAPE.
THE PRESIDENT NAMING DR. OZ
TO THE COUNCIL ON SPORTS
FITNESS AND NUTRITION.
BRIAN: COUNCIL ALSO FEATURE
BILL BELICHICK, HERBAL
WALKER ENCOURAGES AMERICANS
TO BE MORE ACTIVE AND
HEALTHY.
AINSLEY: THAT'S WONDERFUL.
DR. MEHMET JOINS US NOW.
STEVE: CONGRATULATIONS FOR
WINNING AN ELM MINCHTS I WAS
GETTING ON A PLANE TO GO TO
ITALY.
I GOT TO MEET WITH THE POPE.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE
THE POPE FEELS VERY STRONGLY
ABOUT THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY
IN MEDICINE.
THE HAVE THIS COUNCIL THINGS
LIKE THAT THE POPE NEEDS TO
COMMENT ON.
THE BIG MESSAGE TO ALL OF US
IS WAS WE NEED TO GET TO
EVERYBODY PARTICIPATE IN ALL
THE HUGE ADVANCES SUPER
STARS THERE HAD THEIR LIVES
SAVED BY STEM CELLS.
MOST AMERICANS STILL DON'T
HAVE ACCESS TO THE BEST NEW
TECHNOLOGY.
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT.
STEVE: FROM THE POPE TO THE
PRESIDENT.
BRIAN: WALK IN AND WIN AN
EMMY RIGHT FROM THERE.
>> LITERALLY OFF THE PLANE.
MY HAIR WAS STILL MESSY.
STEVE: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
DO AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> INVOLVED WITH KIDS AT
HEALTHCARE.
STARTED HEALTH CORPS KIDS
FOUNDATION NOT LONG AGO.
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE SEE
CHILDREN AS HELPLESS WHEN IT
COMES TO OUR SOCIETY THEY'RE
NOT.
I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD
MORE AGGRESSIVELY NOW THAT
WE HAVE A PLATFORM THAT HAVE
BEEN PROVEN TO HELP YOUNG
PEOPLE LOSE WEIGHT LEARNING
WHAT TO DO.
THINK IT'S ROCKET SCIENCE,
IT'S NOT.
TRANSLATE CONTENT TO CTION A
TEACH WHAT YOU TO DO YOUNG
PEOPLE WILL DO IT.
GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION.
WHEN WE IGNORE CHILDREN AND
LET SOCIAL MEDIA PULL THEM
APART FROM EACH OTHER, WE
DON'T REALIZE WE'RE AURAL
LIKE RAINDROPS FALLING INTO
THE OCEAN OF HUMANITY.
THAT OCEAN IS ALSO IN
RAINDROPS.
WE HAVE TO BE OPEN WITH
THESE ISSUES.
BRIAN: NOT JUST CEREMONIAL
YOU ARE LOOKING TO DO
SOMETHING.
>> I WAS INVOLVED IN THE
PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AS
WELL.
I THINK ALL OF US WHO HAVE
THE BULLY PULPIT TO SPEAK
ISSUES OF HEALTH.
WE ARE LOSING THE BATTLE
WITH OUR CHILDREN.
WE CAN NOT MORTGAGE THE
FUTURE OF THIS NATION BY NOT
GETTING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN
SHAPE.
AINSLEY: YOU HAVE A SHOW
COMING UP ABOUT DIRTY
TRICKS.
WHISTLEBLOWERS TELLING US
THE DANGERS IN OUR COFFEE?
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT.
>> NOT ALL COFFEE.
STEVE: AIRPLANE COFFEE.
>> THE REASON IT CAME UP.
A BUNCH OF REPORTS ON THE
WATER IN THE PLANES NOT
BEING CLEAN.
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DRINK
THE WATER OUT OF THE FAUCET
IN THE PLANE PROBABLY KNOW
THAT THE COFFEE YOU DRINK
DOES COME FROM THAT WATER.
BUT WE DID OUR OWN LITTLE
STUDY.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT ON THE
SHOW THIS WEEKS.
I'M NOT AS WORRIED AS A LOT
OF THE OTHER REPORTS WOULD
HAVE LED ME TO BELIEVE.
STEVE: AIRPLANE COFFEE IS
CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF?
>> CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.
