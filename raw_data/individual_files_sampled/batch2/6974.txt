a new study using statistics from the Department of Justice or the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that whenever we talk about mass incarceration we typically focus on big cities and you know urban areas where massive jails and prisons are located but we never really focus on one of the biggest issues which is jails in rural areas and smaller towns now this study found some really interesting information uh and I want to share with you so these local jails mostly serving rural communities with low crime rates hold a disproportionate number of people who are waiting for trial and who are being held by outside agencies such as overburdened state prison systems and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement so these communities generally lack the resources to steer low-level offenders away from pretrial detention and many expand their jail capacities to win a bigger share of contracts from outside agencies so obviously money talks and uh when it comes to imprisoning people I think that it's clear to a lot of people both on the right on the left that there's now an incentive structure there's a profit motive and imprisoning more people means more money and they really care about how many lives it destroys they don't care about the fact that a lot of these individuals are low-level nonviolent offenders what they care about is the bottom line and we see it on a larger scale when it comes to for-profit prisons but we still see it uh in uh you know publicly funded or public jails and prisons as well uh so I have more details yes this is a um it's feel like what was revealed to me in this article was something that it happens large enough that it affects things because this one things you see in movies or you just know if you I don't know how much you guys ever driven across country but growing up I mean I'm one of five kids so there was no flights if you're going somewhere we're driving and also I just like I've done it with friends - you're driven across state and when you drive through small towns you ought the ruled you guys know the rule drive through small town don't speed I mean a small town being you're driving through it for five to seven minutes and it's a part of interstate and when you sign says speed limit 40 you do not go 42 they will pull you over and they will ticket you they will get you because that's a big source of the revenue so it's just the degree to which that's now stretched up with word you know you do with incarceration is what I did notice that how much it may affect that you know you don't want do anything wrong the small town they're gonna get you local chefs gonna get you but you nail you know so this is this the way it happens I know it's gonna get to that point it's getting worse so let's go to graphic 11 I want to give you some actual stats that were found through the study which by the way was done by Vera Institute of Justice and the safety and justice challenge the numbers show a dramatic increase over the last 25 years in the proportion of people being held in jail while awaiting for trial those still presumed innocent but who cannot afford bail or haven't been assigned it so um this NBC News piece on this issue highlighted a few specific examples and one of the examples that really stood out to me had to do with a woman by name of Jessica Jean CH and she spent 93 days in a jail in Mississippi on drug charges before she got to see a judge she's now suing the state over her criminal case which was dropped after a police video revealed that she was actually innocent okay and so first of all we're supposed to have the right to a fair and speedy trial and the fact that she was behind bars for ninety three days before she got to see a judge is absolutely ridiculous and it of course is even more ridiculous considering the fact that she was innocent she lost 93 days of her life behind bars for something that she didn't live on three months of her life and think about the ramifications of that think about the fact that she probably lost her job right um you're in jail you're in jail that's gonna that's gonna destroy your effect exactly exactly and so I'm glad she's so and I hope that there's justice served but look if it is a low-level offender and it's a non-violent offender there needs to be other solutions than just throwing them in jail right because that doesn't make the situation better at all okay I I feel jail should be reserved for people who serve a threat to society who are threat to society and unfortunately that's not what our justice system is about it's very punitive and there is a profit motive and it's a huge problem yeah and what this what the researchers pointed out really well is that of the basically 2,000 rural counties that they surveyed so the rates are going up so I jump from 49 per 100,000 people in 1970 to 265 400,000 people in 2013 if that isn't an alarming pattern yeah we are seeing an increase like that's that's insane and it's gonna get worse under this administration because of the fact that they are you know they're very it's a for-profit administration it is before we're just retiring about this with education why would it be different when it comes to incarceration I know that this is an issue that you care a lot about Anna so I actually had a question for you because in this there's sort of alluding to some of the bigger contracts out out of play for for-profit prisons and I was running have ever read through a contract and how its worded I have actually okay yeah yeah what is that what well so there are a lot of different issues with these contracts and and one of the issues that comes up over and over again is these um like capacity at capacity clauses or or you know just that the portion of the contract that indicates that the state must provide a certain number of inmates for the institution and the whole point of that is so they can make their money right and the worst thing I mean the worst thing is that now there's an incentive structure to put you know nonviolent people behind bars and essentially ruin their lives and ruin their families lives but another terrible part about all of it is let's say you don't have enough inmates to are incarcerated people to fill those beds the state has to pay for those unused beds so these these private companies which by the way are funded by taxpayer money they're not really privately funded I mean they have investors you know but they're not privately funded um they they get their money one way or the other either you incentivize imprisoning more nun nonviolent people or you get paid anyway even if the beds are on you weird how business works like that it's the capitalistic society where business you take a risk yeah and you have to put in work you have to set up your business credit it make money you have a structure where you're going to be successful there is that this is a absolute win-win this is crony capitalist yeah at the expense of human life they strike they're flying under the radar because they're not operating out of you know in New York City or one more metropolitan areas and you know they really have because we're seeing how this has escalated yeah for them this is big business in these rural towns uh yesterday I was at a Google event about you know reforming the justice system and especially doing something about mass incarceration and imprisoning you know nonviolent drug offenders and you know there was a woman who's been behind bars for over 20 years um her name is Miss Alice and she she lost her job at Federal Express uh she was a single mom she was desperate and she had never used drugs she had no interest in drugs but since she was desperate she got involved in selling right it was her first offense she gets caught it was her first offense she was found guilty of drug conspiracy and as a result was given a life sentence without the possibility of parole life sentence without the possibility of a parole of parole that was her first offense and you know I'm bringing her story up right now because that's 20 years of her life gone right and when Obama was granting clemency to all of these nonviolent drug offenders she was certain that she would be granted clemency because she has a perfect record she has been a model uh incarcerated person and she she's done amazing things behind bars like she's got incredible education she's not a minister she's a role model for a lot of young girls that end up in the prison system it doesn't matter doesn't matter how good of a person she is it doesn't matter that she managed to to get rehabilitated in a system that is not rehabilitative at all it's punitive and punitive period and it's not punitive on axe accident uh our recidivism rate isn't high on accident our recidivism rate is high on purpose it we need they need it they need it they want to make their money yep and it's just sick so these are things that I just want to put on everyone's radar because it's important to address it it's important to find solutions for it I don't want to stretch it too far but there's there's the way that our society approaches people in general and it has the fear the fear based thing and the law and order present the law and order attorney general and then the war on drugs what pictures come in people's head when they think of this they don't think of their kid that goes to the suburban school I'm just saying so it makes it even easier for them to shove people into the dustpan of a prison for 20 years at a time because they can who cares about these people no one's going to fight for them and you're saying she was expecting maybe the clemency didn't come did it no so a lot of people a lot of people did it didn't for her but no one's gonna say I remember this woman who shouldn't totally shouldn't be in the position he's in but they're gonna go but she did the crime got it at the time we know those slogans we've been here too my whole lives so the support for this will even realize the support our general society has for this system of capitalism at the for destroying lives ending lives yeah yeah that's why you need to have a system of government that isn't corrupted by corporate influence you need to have elected officials who actually represent the best interests of the electorate and the American people in general right and that's not what we're seeing right now and it's really sick there's so many levels it is that's it's a it's yeah crazy watch the 13 you just watch the video
