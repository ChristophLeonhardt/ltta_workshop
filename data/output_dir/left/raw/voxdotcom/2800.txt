1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,240
Chances are you’ve seen this tomato before.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,240
It’s become ubiquitous — and quite contentious

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,160
This chart helps to explain why.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,840
We’re releasing more films now than ever
before.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,810
And in a world of excess choice, people need
guidance to make tough decisions.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,600
Which is why we need services like Rotten
Tomatoes

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,820
The internet staple got its start in the late
90s.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,330
And in 2016, Fandango bought its parent company.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, you go to buy a ticket, and there it
is.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560
Which makes that rating important to understand.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,050
Because the tomatometer — it’s more complex
than you might expect.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,760
Films can earn one of three designations:
rotten, for movies rated 60% of critics gave

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,340
a positive review.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,670
Fresh, for those earning a rate above 60%

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,910
Or Certified Fresh.

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,380
That's reserved for films that were reviewed
80 times and 70% or more of the reviews are

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
positive.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,969
5 of those reviews need to be from top critics.

19
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,189
Critics submit a review with their own rating,
or sometimes Rotten Tomatoes asks the critic

20
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:07,899
if it's positive.

21
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:12,490
If it's borderline, Rotten Tomatoes usually
says the review is fresh.

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,009
Rotten Tomatoes depends on a small army of
reviewers to make the tomatometer work.

23
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,770
There's about three thousand critics that
are counted right now though not every critic

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,259
reviews every film so it's usually a few hundred
per film.

25
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,759
That’s Alissa Wilkinson — she’s a staff
film critic at Vox.com.

26
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,740
Which means her reviews count toward the official
Tomatometer.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,219
But the nuance in Alissa’s writing is largely
reduced to the rating you’ll find near the

28
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:38,429
top of her articles.

29
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:43,469
Because Rotten Tomatoes uses a thumbs up thumbs
down method on everyone's reviews it means

30
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,509
that it kind of makes a vaguer statements
of consensus.

31
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,039
we don't get a sense so much of people who
have mixed ideas about a film.

32
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:57,450
Look at these two films: Ridley Scott’s
Alien: Covenant, and Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight.

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,759
Both films are certified fresh, but the similarities
end there.

34
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,979
Alien was an underwhelming blockbuster sequel
with a reported budget of 97 million dollars.

35
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,760
Moonlight was an Oscar winning drama from
a fledgling director with a budget 1/24th

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,940
the size of Alien's.

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,980
Both films achieved the blanket consensus
needed for the certified fresh badge.

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,910
Alien finished with a Tomatometer at 70% — toward
the low end of the certified fresh spectrum.

39
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,380
Moonlight received a 98 percent Tomatometer
— near total consensus.

40
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,000
But Alien was rated 6.4 out of 10 on average,
after Rotten Tomatoes converted critical star

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,010
ratings, letter grades, and number scores
to its 10 point scale.

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,420
Moonlight, on the other hand, earned an average
rating of 9 out of 10 per review.

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,770
Most critics loved it and agreed with one
another.

44
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,270
So the two films earned the badge, but were
qualitatively world’s apart.

45
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,270
This demonstrates the imperfection of the
Rotten Tomatoes system.

46
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,270
This imperfection also appears when you compare
two of 2017’s most critically acclaimed

47
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,270
films.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,050
Here’s another scenario:
Both Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, and Jordan

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,970
Peele’s Get Out are highly rated and certified
fresh.

50
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,580
But according to the Tomatometer, Get Out
edges out Dunkirk by 6 percentage points.

51
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,830
If you saw these scores on the Fandango purchase
page, you might think that critics rated Get

52
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,670
Out higher than Dunkirk.

53
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,730
The Rotten Tomatoes page for each film shows
that Dunkirk earned a higher average rating

54
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,080
per review.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,860
Dunkirk earned a lower tomatometer because
there was less agreement among critics — more

56
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,970
variance in the data.

57
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,040
And when there is less consensus, the rating
is lower.

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,650
But a cute single tomato rating just can’t
give you all that information.

59
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,430
Other rating systems try to circumvent these
problems with their own methodology.

60
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,740
Metacritic, the most visible aggregator aside
from Rotten Tomatoes, is very subjective.

61
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,690
It casts a much smaller net than Rotten Tomatoes,
and generally does more interpretation and

62
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,000
weighting in their scoring.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,970
Metacritic is also less transparent about
their rating system than Rotten Tomatoes.

64
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,420
So, is there a one-size fits all, killer method
to get digestible and accurate reviews of

65
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,350
film in a fraction of time than it logically
could take?

66
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,730
Absolutely not.

67
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,110
That’s preposterous;

68
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,780
the whole point of the Tomatometer is to help
you make a decision quickly.

69
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,010
If you want context, you click and then you
read.

70
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,320
Or, watch.

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,358
And in a world of limited time and excess
choice, we all benefit from a bit of guidance.

72
00:04:18,358 --> 00:00:00,000
Just make sure you know how your guide is
getting you there.
