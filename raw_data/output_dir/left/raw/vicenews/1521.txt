24
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually is thinking and feeling and the</font>

25
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,140
reasons why they might be actually

26
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,750
heading<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards a trump fo oversight a</font>

27
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,879
Clinton or an independent so one of the

28
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,230
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did here at bison use was</font>

29
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,539
actually go to the dinner table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sit</font>

30
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,340
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the family we talked about</font>

31
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,199
voting for Donald Trump take a look at

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,289
this

33
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,160
people are tired of what's going on and

34
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,580
sometimes it'll take a guy that's not

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">your normal guy called misfit and use</font>

36
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,750
him to turn this thing around what this

37
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,810
guy's saying is real he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not afraid to</font>

38
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">say what he wants to say and I realized</font>

39
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,510
little by little the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republican Party</font>

40
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,180
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation I looked up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">conservative party is out of whack as a</font>

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,270
democratic party my party is sold out to

43
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,460
the establishment and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elites and</font>

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,880
it's become so far off track that after

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,560
it was all said and done I said you know

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,420
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> as crazy as this guy says things</font>

47
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,759
he's got something that resonates with

48
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,580
me and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back to the</font>

49
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">foundation what this country started as</font>

50
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,600
do I think he's our savior no but I

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,510
think he can be used at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's got</font>

52
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,360
enough guts to stand<font color="#CCCCCC"> him say hey we got</font>

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to change the way we're going because if</font>

54
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,090
we don't we're done that's why people

55
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,330
will go for a guy like Trump he may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,320
say that but at least he's willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,390
say something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand up for somebody</font>

58
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and our politicians both sides of the</font>

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,959
fence have forgotten who they're serving

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,239
here people want to change but they

61
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,370
didn't know what else to do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

62
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the political establishment that we</font>

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,850
have Republican and Democrat has went

64

believe and this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion this is</font>

66
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,970
the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> election in the</font>

history of our united states and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,670
he is a voter in Ohio<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he is giving</font>

76
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,320
years reasons why he's voting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Trump</font>

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,730
you know he said the Conservative Party

78
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,440
is out of whack the one that he looked

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,750
up to when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> younger is out of</font>

80
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,840
whack is that sort of what you're seeing

81
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,720
is that indicative of the economy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

82
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,250
state of the economy in some of these

83
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,380
Rust Belt states in places like Ohio in

84
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Midwest yeah there's this really</font>

85
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,100
interesting interplay between the

86
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,870
economics and the demographics of a lot

87
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these states that are good targets</font>

88
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,420
for the Trump campaign so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in</font>

89
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,180
Ohio<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unemployment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rate has actually</font>

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,040
come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite sharply from the peaks</font>

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,050
of around eleven percent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

92
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,190
immediate aftermath of the financial

93
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,590
crisis a lot of that has to do with the

94
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,390
industrial mix it was a heavy tilting

95
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,180
towards autumn automotive industry which

96
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,890
benefited a lot from the automotive

97
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,620
bailout under Obama but over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long</font>

98
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,899
term these areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the country have</font>

99
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">been pretty stagnant and there hasn't</font>

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,620
been a lot of job growth there and so

101
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,390
they've seen a lot of out migration and

102
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,000
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of why demographically they</font>

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,330
are more white than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country as a</font>

104
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,610
whole slightly lower education in the

105
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,560
country as a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we know that's</font>

106
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,510
kind of the textbook definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

107
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,580
trump voter is that you Donald Trump

108
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,050
obviously he's been kind of targeting

109
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,330
these states are pretty heavily in the

110
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,580
last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks of campaigning and he has</font>

111
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,120
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking on repeat about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonah you</font>

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,600
know China coming in taking the jobs how

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,950
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that do you think is going to be</font>

114
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,140
resonating with some of these voters in

115
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,990
Ohio even though as you say that you

116
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,030
know the economy isn't actually doing as

117
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,370
badly as perhaps a Donald Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

118
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,110
making out to be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

119
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,669
areas where you'd want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look really</font>

120
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,560
closely to see how that turns out is in

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,030
some of the more industrialized<font color="#E5E5E5"> states</font>

122
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> states around sorry the counties</font>

123
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,640
around Cleveland they will give you a

124
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
sense of how the blue collar vote will

125
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,830
go but that message is clearly clearly

126
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,440
resonated especially with a working

127
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,510
class or non-college educated white men

128
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,360
that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be one</font>

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,490
the key points<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he hits that really</font>

130
00:05:27,490 --> 00:00:00,000
seems to strike a nerve with them
