THE GENERAL.
>> Martha: VERY CONFIDENT DON
BLANKENSHIP IN THE SUIT STORE
THERE.
WE ARE WATCHING THE POLLS CLOSE
IN JUST MINUTES FROM NOW IN KEY
PLACES IN OHIO AND
NORTH CAROLINA.
GREAT FOLKS HERE WITH LOTS OF
EXPERTISE ON WHAT TO WATCH.
DAVID BOSSIE, FORMER FROM DEPUTY
CAMPAIGN MANAGER, FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR AND HE'S ALSO THE
PRESIDENT OF CITIZENS UNITED,
WHICH IS BACKING REPUBLICAN AG
PATRICK MORRISEY IN THE
WEST VIRGINIA RACE AND
REPUBLICAN JIM RENEE C IN THE
OHIO SENATE RACE.
CHRIS STIREWALT IS WITH ME AS
WELL, NATIVE WEST VIRGINIA AND
FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR.
MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY
INSTITUTE FOR POLITICS.
ALSO A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
AND FORMER OHIO STATE SENATE
MINORITY LEADER.
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.
THE EXCITEMENT IS BUILDING
TONIGHT AS WE WATCH THIS AND WE
WILL GET SOME INDICATIONS AND
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FEEL
REALLY HAPPY AT THE END OF
TONIGHT AND SOME ARE GOING TO
FEEL LIKE THEIR DREAMS HAVE BEEN
SUNK.
CHRIS STIREWALT, LET ME START
WITH YOU AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE
MAP HERE, WHAT STANDS OUT TO
YOU?
WHAT YOU WATCHING?
>> I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO
MY FORMER TAYLOR.
>> Martha: YOU KNOW TONY!
>> MY FORMER TAYLOR.
>> Martha: OF COURSE IT IS.
>> I JUST CAME UP FROM THE
DECISION DESK AND I CAN TELL YOU
THAT ANYBODY WHO TELLS YOU THAT
THEY KNOW HOW THIS WEST VIRGINIA
RACE IS GOING TO TURN OUT
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN A CONTEST LIKE THIS
IN WEST VIRGINIA, EVER, EVER.
THERE'S GOING TO BE BIGGER
TURNOUT, THERE'S MORE INTEREST.
THEY'VE NEVER HAD A FOX NEWS
DEBATE THERE.
THEY'VE NEVER HAD A REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY WITH $10 MILLION IN IT.
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S GOING TO
BE AND THAT'S WHY WE PLAY THE
GAME, IT'S AWESOME.
>> Martha: DAVID, YOUR GUY
THERE, PATRICK MORRISEY AND AS
CHRIS SAID WE DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS IS GOING TO TURN OUT BUT
THIS RACE HAS GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT
OF ATTENTION AND DON BLANKENSHIP
OF ATTENTION AND DON BLANKENSHI
BLANKENSHIP, WHO WAS TRAILING --
THE POLLS ARE SO TRICKY, IT'S
HARD TO KNOW HOW REFLECTIVE THEY
REALLY WERE.
HE WAS TRAILING AND THEN IT
LOOKED LIKE HE PICKED UP A BIT
OF MOMENTUM, YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> I THINK THE WEST VIRGINIA
RACE IS AN INCREDIBLY
INTERESTING ONE FOR THE COUNTRY
AS A WHOLE BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT
PATRICK MORRISEY, THE TWO-TIME
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
WEST VIRGINIA WINS.
I THINK YOU WILL BE THE BEST
CANDIDATE IN A GENERAL ELECTION.
HOWEVER, IF MORRISEY LOSES TO
JENKINS, I THINK WE HAVE A
TERRIFIC CHANCE IF EITHER OF
THOSE OF THE NOMINEES TO BEAT
THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT SENATOR.
THE PRESIDENT WON THAT STATE
OVERWHELMINGLY BY ABOUT 34
POINTS.
IT IS A PLACE THAT DONALD TRUMP
CAN REALLY HELP US DEFEAT AN
INCUMBENT U.S. SENATOR THAT WE
NEED TO BE.
IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG ROAD IF
BLANKENSHIP UNFORTUNATELY WINS
THAT RACE.
>> Martha: WILL HAVE A LOT TO
TALK ABOUT IN EITHER CASE THERE
WHEN WE GET SOME MORE
INFORMATION ON THAT.
CAPRI, LET ME GO TO YOU.
LET'S TALK OHIO, WHERE YOU
WATCHING THERE?
>> A NUMBER OF THINGS.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR.
A MATCHUP OF FOUR INDIVIDUALS.
TWO LEADING FOLKS IN THIS RACE,
FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF OHIO,
FORMER TREASURER AND MOST
NOTABLY THE FORMER HEAD OF THE
CONSUMER PROTECTION FINANCE
BUREAU FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS
VERSUS DENNIS KUCINICH.
DENNIS THE MENACE, WHO WAS A
MEMBER OF CONGRESS FOR A NUMBER
OF YEARS AND FAMOUSLY BANKRUPT
THE CITY OF CLEVELAND EVEN
THOUGH THEY ACTUALLY ENDORSED
HIM FOR THIS RACE.
I ACTUALLY VOTED -- MY FORMER
COLLEAGUE IN THE OHIO SENATE WHO
IS ALSO A FORM AT SENATE
MINORITY LEADER BECAUSE HE'S A
GUY WHO IS COMMON SENSE AND CAN
ACTUALLY I THINK BRING THE TRUMP
VOTERS BACK INTO THE FOLD SINCE
HE'S FROM THE VALLEY LIKE I AM.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY A MATCHUP
BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE WING AND
DENNIS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT
WING AND CORDRAY.
WE WILL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.
>> Martha: THE ESTABLISHMENT
WING?
>> COMPARED TO DENNIS HE IS THE
ESTABLISHMENT WING.
>> Martha: THAT JUST PRETTY
MUCH SUMS IT ALL.
