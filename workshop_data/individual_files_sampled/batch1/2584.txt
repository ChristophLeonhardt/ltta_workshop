very rowdy group thank you my friends thank you last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans this is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country but I feel I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together this vast diverse creative unruly energized campaign you represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life you I I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort this is painful and it will be for a long time but I want you to remember this our campaign was never about one person or even one election it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful inclusive and big-hearted we have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought but I still believe in America and I always will and if you do then we must accept this result and then look to the future Donald Trump is going to be our president we owe him an open mind and the chance to leave our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that we cherish it it also enshrines other things the rule of law the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity freedom of worship and expression we respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them
