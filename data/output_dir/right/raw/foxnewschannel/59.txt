193
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,881
ANIMOSITY FOR GENERAL KELLY.

194
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:21,283
I'VE BEEN FIRED BEFORE.

195
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:22,717
I WRITE ABOUT THAT IN THE BOOK.

196
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:23,852
GENERAL KELLY IS THE SECOND

197
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:26,121
PERSON THAT FIRED ME.

198
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:27,122
HE WON'T BE THE LAST PERSON

199
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:28,990
BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE BIT AFTER

200
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:29,391
RENEGADE.

201
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:30,959
HAVING SAID THAT I THINK HE IS

202
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
ILL-SUITED FOR THE JOB.

203
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,628
I'M BEING HONEST.

00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,364
I RUN SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES.

00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,567
I KNOW HOW TO EVALUATE TALENT.

206
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:40,202

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,306
I KNOW HOW TO EVALUATE TALENT.

209
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,174
YOU NEED A LESS MILITANT STYLE

210
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:47,209
IN A ORGANIZATION.

211
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,610
YOU CAN'T BE GRABBING PEOPLE BY

212
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,311
THE COLOR.

213
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:50,178

>> I'M CONFIDENT IT HAPPENED.

217
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:54,583
I KNOW THE PLAYERS INVOLVED.

218
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,017
I AM VERY CONFIDENT.

219
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,385
LET'S NOT LIE ABOUT IT.

220
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:58,720
AINSLEY: SEAN SPICER WROTE ABOUT

00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,662
HE LIKED YOU AS A PERSON, DIDN'T

THINK YOU WERE RIGHT FOR THE

228
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:10,098
JOB.

229
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:12,100
>> SEAN IS ENTITLED TO A PERSON.

230
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:14,903
I THOUGHT HE WAS A LIAR, LIAR

231
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:16,771
SPICE FROM THE SPICE GIRLS.

232
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,173
EVERY SPICE GIRL HAS A NICKNAME.

233
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:20,742
I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY HE HANDLED

234
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:21,376

00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:33,655
HIM AND RICE TRIED TO PREVENT ME

242
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:34,522
