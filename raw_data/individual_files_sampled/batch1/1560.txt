for Denmark in the Winter Olympics curling is the undisputed champion among sports poles apart from the skiing and ice hockey cultures of its scandinavian neighbors here in copenhagen medal hopes are made of stone after curling's Olympic debut 20 years ago gave Denmark their only place on the podium we have one medal and it was in 1998 and it was a silver medal on their women's side and Denmark is very proud of that no one has been able to get a medal in any window squad ever since so that's why it's very special to us it's special as more than just a memory in the era before 1998 Danish curlers had to play on skating rinks that medal may have been a hard act to follow but it did spark what in Danish terms was a winter sports revolution the creation of this club after 1998 men that for the first time at least some Danish winter Olympians could train for the games in their home country curling remains the exception Denmark's top medal prospect Elena Regas trains most of the year at speed skating rinks in Holland and Norway the best Danish cross-country skier Martin Muller lives in Greenland and their great alpine hope Christopher far up far away in Norway Treena crisp on silver with the curling team 20 years ago and is still one of the only Danes to outdo their Scandinavian neighbours in the Winter Games when we won the medal we were higher in the middle statistics then Sweden was four for 24 hours and that was very special for Denmark it's a great feeling but of course we hope every time there is a new Olympic Winter Olympic that there will be more of us then marc has slipped down the rankings since the heady days of 98 but when a single medal means so much every Olympics is a brush with destiny Paul Reis al-jazeera Copenhagen
