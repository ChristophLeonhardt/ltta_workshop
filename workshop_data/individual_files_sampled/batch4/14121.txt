hi I'm Kurt slicker and this is the introduction first episode the debut of my new show now maybe some of you guys know me from Twitter every once in a while I get on this thing and I tweet a little sometimes it's a little how do I say edgy the people seem to like it now I'm also senior columnist for townhall I'm a trial lawyer here in Los Angeles I'm also a retired United States Army colonel went to the Army War College which is a party War College unlike those other war colleges and I have a degree in master's degree in strategic studies so I kind of do a lot of things let's start off with something that's been bothering me a little bit well a lot of things bother me but this has bothered me a lot it has to do with principles and it has to do with class now you may know that Barbara Bush died now she was the wife of George HW Bush the first President Bush and she was also the mother of George W Bush she was also the mother of Jeb Bush which is kind of an asterisk no one I am not generally a fan of the Bush family politically all right and there are lots of reasons and you know there will be a time in a place to go into those this isn't the time this was a great American 92 year old lady the wife of a president the mother of a president she supported that family you know George HW is one of the youngest Navy pilots in World War two she supported him she's formed her his career CIA director or vice president President George Bush supported him backed him all the way you know she was a patriot she's a fierce defender of her family you don't always have to agree with it you didn't have to like everything she said but you know this is America and you should at least respect an American institution so when we decade years of her life to fighting for literacy she was always classy she was always funny she was always smart you know maybe she her politics weren't your cup of tea but that's not the whole thing that's not everything politics is just one aspect of how we should live our lives and when she passed away most Americans behaved with class most Americans said you know I think you know this is a tragedy for the bushes they're in my thoughts and prayers this isn't the time for you know taking out our our pet peeves on the bush men at the time where this wife and mother has passed away and most people didn't Barack Obama put out a nice tweet and I think Bill Clinton did too and various other people you know said nice things and that's all right and proper and that's how it should be but then again not all people did that not all people acted with the kind of class that we might expect and if you are on social media you're not going to be surprised because social media seems to somehow unleash the it'd in people somehow you get on social media suddenly you decide I'm gonna say whatever I wanna say it however I want and you know sometimes you shouldn't now I want to make a big distinction here a big distinction about saying what you want to say legally and saying what you want to say morally legally nobody can stop you you're not gonna get a cop knocking on the door unless you're in England to arrest you for saying something that's you know offensive to the elites or offensive to others but simply because you have the freedom to do something to make an idiot of yourself you don't always have to do it but of course as soon as Barbara Bush died some folks decided this is the perfect time to act like a complete fool one of them was apparently a Stephen Colbert writer she decided this is a great time to make fun of this 92 year old woman's looks what were you thinking were you raised by wolves really what was the thought process that you know this woman has died obviously this family's in a lot of pain time for some laughs I don't white that's no that's just silly but it gets worse because you know people say silly things and usually they apologize and we all move on and some other people get a little worse now there was this woman she's some sort of adjunct professor and I don't know what is University of Fresno you know the legendary University of Fresno because they it goes I think it's Harvard Yale Stanford University of Fresno Princeton I think that's the that's the line up and she's there and she's I think she's a professor of gender studies or Marxist puppetry or perhaps global warming mime encounters with a transgender minor I I don't know but she's one of these intersectional feminists and she intersects all these things you know she's like I think she's a fat activist I think she identifies as Muslim without doing any of the things that you know pious Muslim does she's also LGBTQ in our dollar sign exclamation point hashtag period Euro symbol ml two five nine one whatever she's one of those people one of those people who gets triggered when you know she sees an American flag she's just an awful annoying person who probably had a horrible relationship with her dad and now she's taking it out on the rest of us and of course your dad probably didn't like her cuz she's you know she's terrible he's just gravely disappointed that she's his daughter so we have her and she immediately sees it Barbara Bush has died so she immediately tweets out words the effect of oh good she's dead because the bushes are racist and I'm glad she's dead and moreover I want a you know George senior to die and I want George junior to die and I want you know all the other ones to die because you know they're my political opponents and I'm a leftist so naturally my first thought was political opponent is that I want them to die this is this is inappropriate the question is what do we do about it and this is where principles come in in order to talk about that for a second okay now she works for the University of Fresno which is some sort of State University it's part of the California University System no I honored and hallowed part it's the University of Fresno one of the one of the finest colleges in Fresno among the many so what does a State College do well she's kind of like on leave or something now it hasn't fired her but you know it they got word of it and they were mortified because it's mortifying and she is no longer a you know teaching she's she's suspended she might be fired is that okay is it okay for a state entity is it our principals for to celebrate a state entity silencing someone even when someone is a complete idiot I mean she's just not only an idiot but she's just a malignant tumor on the colon of humanity but should she be fired for saying words now our principals say no freedom of speech is not optional I I've looked at the EEO as a lawyer I've looked at the First Amendment and I got to assure you there's no asterisk about freedom of speech there's no footnote that says except didn't lists the things you you are allowed for you to speak freely that's kind of the whole point of free speech so our principles say she shouldn't be she shouldn't be fired as a practical matter is that what we say anymore because the other side has changed the rules they have imposed new rules they have imposed new rules that say in fact here in academia we're going to control speech we are going to persecute conservatives who say what what they want to say if it offends us we're gonna fire them we're gonna Vesta gate them we're gonna harass them we're gonna do all sorts of things to punish conservatives who acts sighs free speech and academic setting so we're faced with a question how do we as conservatives respond to this horrible woman who works for a state entity and just says the most irritating and noxious unpleasant dumb things well under the old rules we'd say well let's talk about how stupid she is because you fight bad speech with good speech but is that the new rules because here's the problem leftists by exercising their new rules to silence a freedom of speech of conservatives have gotten a free ride because we don't force them to confront the consequences of their own new rules as we have not applied the new rules to them perhaps that we perhaps that's that's a mistake perhaps our principles can only be defended by violating them by punishing her for her speech now hear me out and I'm not sure I'm advocating this but it's certainly something that we've got to talk about how can leftists know it's wrong to persecute people for speaking freely if they're allowed to persecute people for speaking freely but they're never persecuted themselves look pain is the teacher pain punishment is a classic time-tested method of dismay ting people from doing bad things and suppressing free speech is a bad thing shall we give him a taste of our own medicine should we fire this bloated human carcass from her you know mediocre job at this mediocre university out in the sticks maybe we should maybe we should teach her a lesson maybe you should teach all the Liberals a lesson that if you want a world where there is no free speech that's a word you've got to live it you don't get a special bubble there's no exception we're not going to play that two rules game there's one set of rules which do you want it to be is there free speech or is there not what are your principles leftists I hate the word principles I'm starting to hate the word principles when I got a set it's so annoying because the word principle has been adopted by these nevertrump guys right the guys who just hate Trump and a lot of them hate Trump because you know Trump came in and disrupted their good gig a lot of these guys were professional conservatives and then conservative incorporated and they were doing their conservative things and you know when Republicans lost they could go into opposition they make a lot of money saying well we get back in we'll fight and when conservatives were you know when Republicans were in power they mean who were in power give us money and we'll fight and you know they never fought and we always lost and suddenly we normal American voters started holding them accountable and when they came up short we elected Donald Trump and Donald Trump was just not impressed by this is Bill Kristol who's that max boot is that the guy with a stupid hat you know who are these guys who are these clowns and he was just wasn't impressed by them and they suddenly found themselves you know outside they weren't the in-crowd anymore they weren't cool they weren't that the liberal establishment spec conservatives anymore that Jennifer Rubens you know suddenly her nobody's taking their calls hi Whitehouse I'd like to talk to I'm Bill Kristol okay are have you ever seen the Love Boat I do a lot of cruises yeah that's me hello hello okay they fell back not on oh my gosh you guys have stripped me of my power and position and prestige but you've gone against our conservative principles yeah that's the ticket our conservative principles our conservative principles are everything and you you you Trump voters you you guys who actually fight whoa whoa I never fight we're better than that you know that's not who we are what a load what a load these guys let's talk about principles in action because last week we had it with the Michael Kohn raid Michael Kohn was Donald Trump's lawyer and for reasons that are still unclear a bunch of federal agents went in and raided his law office now lawyers have attorney-client privilege material will talk about attorney-client privilege in a minute but I turn a client privilege material is privileged it means people can't look at it why because we want to be we want people to be able to seek out legal representation if everything you say to your lawyer because you've got to tell your lawyer the truth if everything you say the lawyer can be discovered by the feds well then then you can't be adequately represented look III will get people coming to me and I say look guy tell me everything well no tell me everything tell me all the bad stuff all the stuff you think hurts your case because I got to tell you that other guy he's gonna find it out cuz I'm gonna find out what the other guys hasn't told his lawyer I'm totally gonna find it out and you know the worst time to find out something your client has failed to tell you is when you're in a trial that's really bad that changes everything for the worse I Drive a really nice car and a large part of is because people didn't tell their lawyers everything and I was able to use that so attorney-client privilege is critical now these guys and so is confidentiality and privacy even though some might not be a turning client privilege you've got to keep it confidential for instance my clients honor I'm tell you what my clients are it's now your business ah but turns out Sean Hannity was one of Michael Cohn's clients and there's not even a remote allegation sean hannity had anything to do with any crime of any kind and yet his name was revealed this judge allowed his name to be revealed and he was embarrassed all the meet all the Liberals when they went nuts about it and he was embarrassed but he you know it was against justice department policy but it is bata against basic fairness he was a person who went and got legal advice and now his name was dragged through mud people were saying oh well it's another sex cover-up or he's a crook bla bla bla that's inexcusable and you know what the principal's gang did the ones who are the family you know it's James Madison said let me quote Winston Churchill to you you know what these guys said these principal guys when they saw the principle of due process being trampled by the feds in the context of a guy they didn't like because I'm like Sean Hannity cuz you know he's popular and rich unlike them they laughed they giggle they giggled like little schoolgirls except not as masculine they giggled they thought was funny so there's their principles principles are super important when they're useful but when they're not useful you just get rid of them you know it's not a principle if it doesn't apply to everybody if it doesn't apply to your enemies if it then it's just a pose and that's what these guys are they're posers they're frauds now look I let's let's let's move on from these shallow weasels to attorney-client privilege because I want to talk to you more about that because you know I've gotten a real education attorney-client privilege from all the Twitter juris doctors out there all the guys with you know I've got 48 followers let me tell you what attorney-client privilege is because I've only been a trial lawyer in a name partner for 24 years 24 coming on in 24 years and so I mean I I like to think I'm privileged a little more than you know impeach Trump 99 on Twitter and you know with his 18 followers let me tell you what attorney-client privileges attorney-client privilege is a protection of communications between an attorney and a client now of course you know ask who is a client well a client is anyone who has a confidential communication it's guys search if somebody comes to me I mean I'm a licensed attorney comes to me and ask me legal advice and has a reasonable belief that I am giving legal advice that person now has the privilege and I have to safeguard it now privilege didn't belong to me as a lawyer I I have no rights in the privilege my only obligation is to defend it and the person who holds the privilege that's that's the holder that's the person now does somebody have to hand me a dollar no it's like a Hollywood cliché you don't have to do it how about a written agreement I saw on Twitter you have to have your art your you don't have an attorney-client relationship blossoms a written agreement that is simply false a written agreement is simply proof of an attorney-client relationship it is not the relationship a relationship exists when the client reasonably expects that yours lawyer now that's why when some people will ask me legal advice I will sometimes say oh look I'm not your lawyer but I'll tell you what I think then they can't reasonably believe that I'm acting as their attorney and remember I have to give good advice too if they reasonably think I'm a lawyer I can't just go yeah and when your daddy when you're stopped for a DUI you should you should get out of the car and smack around the cop that's a good idea okay that would be that would be malpractice and you know that and I'd be on the hook for it now if I said I'm not your lawyer and I'm not representing you but I think if you get pulled over Yatta you know start talking about the guys mom Brian no malpractice can't reasonably think I'm acting as their attorney Mary it's designed to protect individuals not lawyers it's designed so that if you're even remotely seeking attorney-client information if you're seeking advice from a lawyer you're protected and it's a very expansive privilege so how could Sean Hannity be a client well here's a couple ways hey Michael let's can you give me some advice on how to sell some property how about hey Michael I'm thinking of suing these people what do you think of that and they talk and then then they do not mind then Hannity doesn't hire them are you are you require is there attorney-client privilege when you're consulting with a lawyer about a potential representation of course there is because you have to talk about all the facts so even if I don't get hired I can talk to somebody for hours and not get hired I'm still privileged there's a whole bunch of people I've talked to and we decide not to work together their stuff is still privileged and you know as a columnist and a you know conservative commentator this is a giant pain because so many of my good stories I treat his attorney-client privilege because anytime anybody talks to me I just naturally try and keep it confidential you know sometimes I'll say I'm not your attorney blah blah blah make it real clear other times you know somebody says hey Kurt guess what I heard what do you think you know and I don't specifically tell them I'm not your I'm going to keep it in coffins you can't go wrong keeping it in confidence now are there exceptions this very very important rule very important rule yeah there's one called the crime fraud and crime fraud exception and crime fraud exception is kind of interesting crime fraud exception is that a lawyer and a client cannot protect their communications if they were made in furtherance of a crime that is if you know the client came in and said okay let's go rob this liquor store and I said that's a great idea let's go rob that liquor store no no Terry client because it's a crime fraud thing if he said I want to go into the this liquor store with a gun pointed at the guy behind the counter and said give me all your money is that legal Kurt because I plan to do it no that's that's that's a really bad idea that is not legal and my legal advice is that you do not do that oh okay that is covered by attorney-client privilege attorney-client privilege is designed to allow people to be talked out of doing something that's illegal you know it comes up a lot in transactional stuffing in election stuff hey can I organize my political action committee this this in this way and that way I can get money from over here but I don't have to report it is that okay no that's not okay you've got to do it this section and that reg says this and you've got you can't do that okay so sometimes people come to make people come to any lawyer and say I want to do something and your advice is no that's that's probably not going to be legal and they're trying to find out that it's legal that's we want to encourage that and that is not under the crime fraud exception okay the crime fraud exception does not mean or should not mean that the feds plowing to your office take all your attorney stuff confidential in on client privilege and on client privilege stuff and put it out there and Jim Potts ruined that's that is not you know looking for something that falls in a crime fraud exception that is improper and it should not happen it may happen here because of course as we've seen the law doesn't seem to matter anymore because principles don't seem to matter when it comes to taking out Trump or Trump allies but what should happen first of all is they shouldn't take most of the attorney-client stuff in the first place any warrant should be narrowly tailored so that that stuff is not swooped up this federal judge there's a friend of the Clintons she hopefully will point what's called a special master and that's a neutral prior former judge who will sit down and look at the stuff and go okay this stuff is privileged this stuff is not privileged and covered by the warrant and you guys can have it instead of having an FBI taint team how apt going through a stuff going ooh privileged stuff ooh unprivileged stuff let's leak it cuz they're gonna leak it cuz stuffs already leaking now let's also distinguish confidential information the the the the fact that Sean Hannity had an attorney-client relationship with Michael Kohn and we don't know what was may or may not be covered under attorney-client privilege but even if it isn't it should be confidential it's private it should never have been disclosed to open court because he was subject to embarrassment humiliation by a fairly more likely unfair and you know that's that's one of the dangers here when we put aside our principles it's becoming essential to these people the only the only thing that matters to them is getting rid of Donald Trump and they're willing to do anything willing to abandon the basic principles of due process to do it I think it's disgraceful I think it's disgusting and I think it's got to stop will it stop I don't know I think I think maybe the president's got to stop it I think maybe the president needs to fire Jeff Sessions move Scott Pruett over and make him the Attorney General because he's not recused and he can get in there and regulate because this is going nuts this is going crazy and we are getting far afield of our principles and you know that's been kind of the theme of our talk today how do we balance our principles against the new rules because you know when you impose new rules you impose them for everybody I think the Liberals are going to miss the day when attorney-client privilege is sacrosanct I think they're going to miss the day when a free speech was sang course Act I think they're gonna miss the day when people could do politics as normal instead politics is bloodsport but we'll see anyway I just want to thank you for being part of my debut here on rebel media
