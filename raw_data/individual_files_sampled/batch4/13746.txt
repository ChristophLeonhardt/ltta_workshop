well the excitement of the Republican primaries is over it sort of feels like that day in January when the holidays end and you finally pack up the ornaments for another year and throw away the Christmas tree except instead of a Christmas tree it's democracy and instead of another year it's more like a thousand years of darkness now is the time for thoughtful people to look back over the last few months and ask themselves what happened who can we blame for it what punishment could possibly be horrible enough for them and how would they look covered in lime of course I don't to seem to look down on or disrespect the berserk simian minkum poops who voted for Donald Trump I don't want to seem like one of those elite establishment types who get all mired in concepts like reality or constitutional governance or honesty or decency or civilized behavior or decency or any of the other brie cheese and Chardonnay hoity-toity ideas that lift us above the level of reptiles because Donald Trump is going to make America great again if by America you mean dreamland and by great you mean a crap fest and if you don't want to be left standing out in the cold with nothing to keep you company but your principles and your humanity and a nice glass of chardonnay it's time to come to terms with Trump's nomination and decide on a response here are a few options along with their pros and cons option one you could vote for Hillary Clinton plunge in America into a nightmare of political hackery and misguided leftist policy that will ravage our economy and send the world spiraling into chaos Pro it would give us a sense of seamless continuity with the last seven years cons the apocalypse and her screechy voice option two you could refuse to vote and let Hillary get elected by default Pro you could sleep at night knowing you weren't to blame for the destruction of the country con you'd probably have to wake up sometime three you could set your misgivings aside and vote for Donald Trump Pro you would avert Hillary's gutting of the Constitution and a catastrophic mishandling of world events con you would usher in Trump's gutting Constitution and catastrophic mishandling of world events now when I'm faced with tough choices like this I have a little trick I like to use to help me make up my mind first I take three playing cards say an ace a king and a queen and I set them on a table in a little pile and I doused them in lighter fluid and set them on fire then I press my face into the blaze until my flesh bursts into flame I still don't know what to do but at least now I've been reduced to a smoldering pile of ash so that's actually an improvement trigger - would you stop laughing at my own jokes oh that's me laughing all right here we are we've got the great Henry Olsen coming on to help us assess what the hell just come back to her country he's a terrific writer at the National Review and many other places observes election things he's predicted so much that's come down the pike so I wanted to get his take on what may be coming down though on the pike and you know we're gonna take our time deciding what our response should be I mean I feel that we at least have until the apocalypse which was last Tuesday so I guess that's not so good meanwhile you know please subscribe you get to watch us as we make up our mind as we ponder on events you don't you won't just listen you can watch us you can also send in questions and next Wednesday we'll have a mailbag and answer some of your questions and of course we'll be answering the most the two real big mysteries of what was John Kasich thinking and when's the next boat leave for New Zealand all right so it's the day after the day after Donald Trump for certain claimed the nomination the Republican nomination for the presidency our heads real and yet we ask ourselves the big questions everybody's asking is can Donald Trump unify the party he just destroyed completely and Hillary Clinton have to give her credit put out a great ad yesterday the an ad about can he can Trump Unova unify the party this is the ad not the kind of Hillary let's take a look at this ads you put up I am a unifier we're gonna be a unified party P at the heart a phony Donald Trump is the know-nothing candidate Donald is a bully this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter who attributed a reporter's questions to her menstrual cycle blood coming out of her wherever the most vulgar person ever aspired to the presidency the man who seems to only feel big when he's trying to make other people look small the side of deep insecurity and weakness the bullying the greed the showing off I'm really rich the misogyny the absurd third-grade theatrics he's a race-baiting xenophobic religious bigot a narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen he would not be the commander-in-chief we need to keep our country safe this guy is so unfit to be commander-in-chief his domestic policies would lead to recession his foreign policies would make America and the world less safe I brought people together he's got he needs he needs therapy this is a great ad it's all the people if you weren't watching if you haven't subscribed it and couldn't see it it's all the leaders of the Republican Party just trashed trashing Trump completely and fair enough because the funny thing of course is that a lot of those people in the next couple of weeks are suddenly going to the you know the veil is gonna fall the scales are gonna fall from their eyes and suddenly they're going to see that if they want to win they're gonna have to support Trump and they're gonna change their tune not here we don't know what we're going to do in terms of voting but we know this man is unfit for office the only thing is is the competition is worse we also just don't know what's gonna happen and I feel that there's more stuff to come Trump himself says he doesn't want everybody on board he was asked earlier in the day yesterday whether he was going to take any outside funding and he talked about the unity of the party this is what he said I do love self-funding and I I don't want anything for myself but we do need money for the party the party will come together I don't think it's imperative that the entire party come together I don't want everybody I don't even want certain people that were extraordinarily blessed to let them go their own way let them wait eight years or let them wait 16 years or whatever because I think we're going to have a great success against probably Hillary because the system is totally rigged against Bernie I've been totally rigged against him so probably we're gonna have Hillary so if you insulted him personally no it's always personal the donald never mother country never mind the constitution never my principles never mind anything is it's just if you insulted donald trump forget it forget the whole thing and so the the point about self-funding by the way totally gone he's now going to accept here's the wall street journal' facing a prospective tab of more than 1 billion to finance a general election run for the White House Donald Trump reversed course Wednesday and said he would actively raise money to insure his campaign has the resources to compete with Hillary Clinton's fundraising juggernaut his campaign also was beginning to work with the Republican National Committee to set up a joint fundraising committee after his two rivals Cruz and Kasich dropped out in the wake of mr. Trump's resounding Indiana win on Tuesday I'll be putting up money but won't be completely self funding mr. Trump said he's going to create he says a world-class finance organization the campaign will tap his expansive personal rolodex in a new way so the thing is you know this is all through the primaries he was saying I'm self-funding all these other guys were bought and paid for and I kept saying you know Donald Trump has been buying and paying for politicians for years and all he wants us to be on the other side that equation you know I am I am I it's like it's like the end of the Mafia the of the Godfather remember the end of the Godfather were Corleone says to his son you know I'm tired of being on the string with these politicians I wanted I wanted you to be the senator I wanted you to be senator Corleone well here he is so and The Times of The New York Times a former newspaper says the Trump is now reaching out quietly to the establishment which of course he's got to do and you know it's not entirely fair some people have said Oh Trump is the establishment but that's not entirely fair he violates every principle that we thought was a Republican principle you know he violates principles of entitlement reform small government constitutional government of free trade violates that he's less of a hawk than the Republican Party has basically been but now according to The Times Donald Trump is turning his attention to the general election has and has begun quietly reaching out to key elements of the Republican establishment as he seeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle against Hillary Clinton mr. Trump who was expected to run on an on ideological platform of his own design I love that that's a nice New York Times in subtlety I like that an on ideological platform of his own design is trying to reassure party officials that he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow like the norm from Cheers I don't know what norm this follow but he says he's going to reassure them that he's gonna follow certain norms and that he is capable of producing an organization and infrastructure they can sustain a costly general election campaign when an interesting thing you know I've been asked going around asking people the question that I keep asking people is are we were responsible for the results of a non vote when we have two candidates Trump and Clinton who are not fit for office you know a lot of people are saying quite fairly I'm just gonna vote down ticket I'm not going to vote for the presidency and of course a lot of other people especially the people on the Trump train are saying well then you're just essentially voting for Hillary Clinton and I've asked people you know how do you feel about that what does your conscience say to you about not voting at all if it means a Hillary if it might mean a Hillary victory and is there anything I asked a friend yesterday is there anything that would make you vote for Donald Trump that would decide you and my friend said and this has now become a meme I didn't realize this this is now kind of getting passed around if he appointed a cabinet before he was elected which would be pretty strange but if he appointed a cabinet and it was a cabinet full of serious conservative people so in other words if he had Rudy Giuliani is Attorney General that would be very hopeful if he had you know Louie the Shiv Falcone who helped him look Manhattan you know this is my friend Louie tersh if he's gonna be the Attorney General I thank you very much ladies and gentlemen I'm going to be a guy Attorney General it's not an honest Rico stuff is going to be happening anymore believe me believe me I'd but frankly no more Rico believe me if that happens the whole nervous but who knows he might do it The Times The New York Times interviewed Trump about what the start of a trump presidency would look like and Trump made a lot of noise conservative sounding noise mostly which was convincing enough so that the Trump took into the Trump The Times took it off the front page that it was on the front page of my little Apple when I looked at the paper wasn't there shortly after the November 8 election president-elect Trump and his vice president most likely a governor or member of Congress would begin interviewing candidates for the open Supreme Court seat and quickly settle on a nominee in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia this is Trump talking to the New York Times very recently about what the start of his presidency would look like he would start quote building a government based on relationships perhaps inviting the Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at mar-a-lago over golf and to pound lobsters that would be a big thrill for Ryan they'll sell him anything for that on inauguration day he would go to a beautiful gala ball or two and by the end of his first hundred days as the nation's 45th leader I'm sorry he would after the beautiful gala ball he would focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and he would call up corporate executives and threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the United States I'm not sure if that would be like assassination or torture or what I guess tariffs such a vote by the end of his first hundred days is the nation's 45th leader the wall with Mexico would be designed the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion so Trump says I know people aren't sure right now what a president Trump will be like he says but things will be fine I'm not running for presidents make things unstable for the country so he's reaching out to the people who look at him and panic and he's trying to say things are just gonna be just the way I said they are and the only thing in that list that you know kind of got my dander up was the idea that he's going to threaten American business leaders that if they leave the country he's going to take punitive measures I assume those punitive measures are going to be tariffs that's that seems to me a recipe for driving up prices and causing you know busy I mean business businesses are powerful there they are where remember you can have you can have businesses without a government you can't have a government without businesses you can have a government government makes no money the money flows into the government from the people who are actually making money so you've got to have those businesses when when Barack Obama said you know if you built a business you didn't build that the fact is if you're the president you didn't build that if you're the government you didn't build that we build the government but businesses are built by individuals and by the companies that and by the you know their workers so that makes no sense to me but other things you know they sounded fine so that that's where he's reached out and of course the great argument for Donald Trump is Hillary Clinton Hillary is now forming her general election strategy and she put forward as she gave her she how she's gonna present herself as the wise old and against the loose cannon a term she uses maybe five times in this one-minute statement I've seen the presidency up close from two different perspectives and I think I know what it takes and I don't think we can take a risk on a loose cannon like Donald Trump running our country you know Donald Trump has said it's okay for other countries to get nuclear weapons I think that's just downright dangerous he has said wages are too high I think we need to have a raise for the American people raise the minimum wage get wages back going up I think when he says women should be punished for having abortions that is you know just beyond anything that I can imagine I think most women can a man he did walk that back well he's a loose cannon I mean he's somebody who has said so many things and I'm sure he'll be scrambling and his advisers will be scrambling but he's already said all of these things he says climate change is a Chinese hoax and I think it's real and we've got to pull the world together to deal with it so you can go down a long list some of which he's tried to bob and weave a little bit but I think it's a risk I think he is a loose cannon and Canon's tend to misfire so while she was saying that the Romanian hacker gusoff er was in her pocket stealing her emails says he read all her emails and hacked in it was easy all he had to do was just find her password and he was in you know we're in this situation where the best argument for Donald Trump is Hillary Clinton and the best argument for Hillary Clinton is Donald Trump so let us it's a confusing situation let us bring on our guest Henry Olsen unfortunately we couldn't get him on video we're going to have him on the phone so if you're watching and it seems like he's not moving around much that's because that's a still picture Henry Olsen is a senior fellow at the ethics and Public Policy Center prior to that he was a vice president at the American Enterprise Institute a vice president with my friends the Manhattan Institute and president of the Commonwealth foundation what he is he's an election analyst and a political essayist and what he does is he studies conservative politics he looks at election returns and pulled data try to understand why people vote the way they do and tries to teach thinkers conservative politicians and thinkers how they can best advance their ideas in the climate they face he is the author of four phases of the Republican Party this is one of those interesting theories that we're gonna talk about four phases of the Republican Party which is published by Palgrave co-authored with Dante Scala and it's available you can get it as an e-book or a hard copy four phases of the Republican Party are you there Henry I am good how are you I you know it's quite something and I've been reading you a long time and you have been I mean you must feel like the boy Casandra at this point because you have been screaming for a long time that the Republican Party was not paying attention to the people that should be paying attention to is that a fair way to put it I do feel a Cassandra that had the Republican Party done more to talk with and understand these voters it would not be facing the impending nomination of Donald Trump so who were they who are the voters they ignored and what do they have to say our people who tend to be downscale economically compared to the people who are here in Washington they tend to be people who didn't graduate from a four-year college they tend to be middle income or more or less and these are people who are under more threat economically and whose values are in disrepute by the elites in this country and they want somebody who says look you're not collateral damage on the pursuit to a global economy you're American citizens too and we're gonna make government work in your interest and we're not going to ignore you but the Republican Party who almost to a person has largely ignored them for years and Donald Trump comes along and says hey I get you I hear you I love you I've got your back put me in the White House and they responded yeah in in space they responded no question at you you called this in the New York Times I saw a quote from you I'm watching us 160 year old political party commits suicide so tell me about the four phases of the Republican Party because this played into what you were saying when you were trying to warn the party who are as four phases the phases of the Republican Party are the four ideological factions that existed pre Trump and what I've argue is that what Trump did is kind of bring in and create his own new fifth faction but the four phases are two types of movement conservatives the so with people we would know as religious evangelicals social conservatives and fiscal conservatives but together even though they make a lot of noise when you look at the actual voters there are only about a third or of the Republican Party nationally and the rest of the Republican Party of the other two phases these are the moderates who are the sort of people who have been keeping John Kasich in the race and then the middle people who tell pollsters they're somewhat conservative in the best way I can describe them as these are the people who prefer John Boehner to Ted Cruz and they like lower taxes but they also like compromise they like governing and I suspect although the pollsters don't ask that if you said would you rather have the best Republican possible or would you rather stop the Democrat that these are the people who would prefer stopping the Democrat and where the Republican party had been going wrong for years was that the major factions were at war with each other and none of them were paying attention to the group of voters who could swing the general election in their favor which is the group that Trump has brought together in a fifth faction that doesn't care a whole lot about ideology but does feel that the Republican Party should be on their side and start protecting them from the downside effects of the competition they've been subject to for twenty years the people who were I called them idealist I mean I'm I'm a was a Cruz guy in terms of principle I didn't think he was a very appealing candidate but in terms of constitutional principle that's kind of where I stand but I have listened to a lot of the harsh rhetoric of the right that what they kind of kind of categorizes the FoxNews rhetoric the Rush Limbaugh rhetoric and I've wondered sometimes if the purity of their ideals doesn't get in the way of actual and actual functioning Republican Party they've been perfect being the enemy of the good sort of thing has that played into this do you think I think it's the reason the main reason why Ted Cruz is out of the race right now is that in the early races Ted Cruz was consolidating himself as the candidate of the two factions of the very conservatives if the Republican Party were the tea party plus the social conservatives Ted Cruz would be the nominee not Donald Trump because he's been winning those voters consistently he even won those voters in Indiana but they're only a third of the party and when you said tell the other two-thirds of the party that not only do we disagree with you but we think that you're impure and that you're closeted Democrats then when your guy comes around and asks for your help you may not find it very forthcoming yeah yeah that's I you know and I don't think it's I don't think it's an accident that John Boehner chose the week before the Indiana primary to accidentally Lucifer in the flesh that was a signal to everyone whose instincts who the people in the early stages were backing Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush the somewhat conservatives and when Cruz won in Wisconsin is because he won them over and then in the month after that he lost them again and in the run-up to the final battle John Boehner sent a message to everybody hey remember what he thinks about you remember what he did to us and they back and and Croods lost some what conservatives very handily in Indiana yeah yeah no that sounds that sounds exactly right so now we're looking at the future there are two big questions the first is what about the general as you look at the general what do you see Nate Silver wrote yesterday that Trump was going to have a hard road oh but but Trump is kind of confounded every prediction so far what do you think it's not an impossible but he is somebody who is going to have to reach out to both Republicans and Republican leaning independence and say it's safe to get back in the water and that's gonna be one reminding them that they really dislike Hillary Clinton which they do but also saying you know I'm not the wild guy that you think I might be I'm actually somebody whose word is my bond and somebody who can run together and that's what his moves over the last couple of days have been if he's successful at doing that then he could make him fight and go of it because Hillary Clinton is extremely unpopular you saw that in the polls that were showing John Kasich beating or handling John Kasich was basically generic non-crazy non-ideological Republican he wasn't well-known but to the extent he was known people felt safe with him if Trump can restore that he can take the voters who are energized who are voting who haven't voted before or who voted for Obama four years ago add them to the Romney base and he could win it's just gonna be difficult for him to combine the safety message with the rile em up message over a period of six months plus I mean it seems to be his personality he doesn't really seem to be able I always say this you know we always commentators are always telling politicians what they can do but they they can't change their nature and he doesn't seem to be tip her tail is his tongue at all I mean he went right back to his Rafael Cruz killed Kennedy routine yesterday after he'd won already when I was a campaign consultant in my youth the saying always was that the campaign ultimately reflects the candidate and if the candidate in this case is somebody who is prone to saying outlandish things and attracting free media as a result then the candidate can't be disciplined because the candidate inherently is undisciplined and that's gonna destroy his safety message so we'll find out whether or not that is the man or if that's just been an act for the last six months so looking at it from the other side from the side of the never Trump's the far right the people who are looking at at Trump as I'm looking at him just absolutely appalled appalled not just by his policies because I don't really know what his policies would be but I'm appalled by his character I really am and you know can he win those people over are they gonna sit this out do you think I think they're I think what he has to do is minimize the Republican slippage but not he can't eliminate it there are going to be a few percent of the electorate who aren't going to sit this out or if Ben Sasse is intriguing tweet is a prelude to his declaring that he's going to be a key hodduk third party candidate then people will vote for him it won't be a huge percent but 1 2 3 4 percent of the general electorate is in this highly polarized age more than enough to cost him equally as important as the ideological never Trump errs is the people who are the Kasich voter the somewhat conservative voter who aren't ideologically opposed to him but are really appalled by him as you said appalled by his character those are the people he's moving at right now I think he's figuring that I'm never gonna get the never Trump errs on my side but if I can get the person who voted for Romney to hold their nose and vote for me they hate Hillary and they're no longer scared by me you know I can lose that 1 or 2 percent and make it up I'm not sure he can but I think that's his calculus what about whether conservatism I guess is what I want to ask the party just left the station without us where do we go how do how do we become a force in American politics again I think what we need to do is recognize that Americans challenges have changed Americans worries have changed we don't have the same economic base that we did 35 years ago with Ronald Reagan people a lot of times because we were successful aren't paying as heavy a tax burden it's much more laying on the rich than it was when Reagan was elected and so consequently they're not as concerned with tax cuts or income tax cuts they might be concerned with payroll tax cuts so I think conservatives need to do is first get out of the purity moralis and adopt reagan's strategy of 70% of the loaf is where i want to be that's 70 percent of a loaf is a victory and then the second thing is we have to understand that the people who are open to joining our coalition are not free-market purists they are people who want government to help in an active but limited way to make sure that they are part of the American Dream a pursuit of free trade without dealing with the doubt dislocations is going to signal to these people that they're not part of America they're not part of a conservatism that cares about people like them and so conservatism much as in the 70s it had to adapt to deal with the rise of social conservatism and with the challenges of stagflation we need to deal with the challenges of globalization and we need to deal with the challenges of being a unipolar power and that might call for more restraint than we've X then we've exercised in the past 15 years you know I've one last only time for one last question I'm talking to Henry Olson for faces the author of four phases of the Republican Party from Palgrave co-authored with Dante Scala and it's available as an e-book or in hardcopy for faces of the Republican Party I guess my my final question is this we joke a lot here about The Daily wire about the end of the Republic and I'm never quite sure how much we're joking what keeps you up at night I mean when you look at this situation you look at someone like Clinton Hillary Clinton who seems to me unfit for office running against Donald Trump who seems to me unfit for office do you fear for the country or do you feel this is just another bump in the road the country that's been through far worse than this and we're gonna be okay I both fear for the country but I'm not consigned to that there are temptations that people are taking they're grabbing the forbidden fruit of authoritarianism or of decline of our liberties but I think some of that and a lot of that actually comes to the door of conservatives of not having recognized where the American people are right now and adapting to meet the voters where they are I think if we do that America wants to be governed by a centre-right coalition that enhances rather than their strict freedom that respects a strong but not an overweening power overseas and respects Liberty within the context of traditional morality it doesn't want to go off the boat in one direction or another unless it's pushed but we have to offer them that and if we do I think we'll win and I think we'll win for years and years to come but we have to choose that and if we don't the alternative is going to be out of desperation they will choose one form of Liberty the denying force whether it's the soft social democracy of a Clinton or the authoritarianism of a trump one of the best as I expected one of the best analyses I've heard this season Henry the Olson thank you very much for coming on I hope you'll come back thank you very much all right I'll talk to you again thanks Henry Olson the author of four phases of the Republican Party you can read his stuff at National Review just an excellent observer has predicted so much of what we've seen and really analyzes things to the ground without without passion you know without getting crazy about all right we've come to the end of an apocalypse that week and yet here we are standing in the rubble of our republic stuff I like I'm gonna end today if this is not you know I had forgotten all about the song until I started to think of what song would be appropriate to end the week on and I suddenly realized this should be been Shapiro's theme song but we got to tell Ben about the song because this is a great song you know if you think that things like this haven't happened to great nations before in the 1950s after Britain essentially won world war two I mean of course they couldn't have done without us but they stood alone for a long time against Hitler and against all of Europe and Nazi Europe they got rid of the guy who had guided them through the war the conservative Winston Churchill and they brought in this left-wing government and of course you know the the the forces of socialism were very very strong then because the Soviet Union was still in this phase of industrializing people thought they were gonna do great this I've seen the future and it works it's the Soviet Union so Noel Coward possibly the one of the most talented show business people who ever lived I always say that Knowlton coward is my proof that that the very far right Christians are wrong and that gay people won't be allowed to have into heaven because if no coward isn't in heaven it won't be heaven because songwriters he wrote a hilarious song called there are bad times just around the corner this is in 1952 and just listen to this one verse and then we'll come back this really should be Ben's theme song so listen to the verse alone we'll come back and say but it's as clear as crystal from Bridlington to Bristol that we can't save democracy and we don't much care if the Reds and the Pink's believe that England stinks and the world revolution is bound to spread we better all learn the lyrics of the old red flag and wait until we drop down dead alike historic Michael was in all cowards there are bad times just around the corner I'm Andrew Klavan this is the Andrew Clavin show we'll be back next week we're not going anywhere a tune in
