1
00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:03,133
TONIGHT CORRESPONDENT TALKS

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:05,069
ABOUT THE BAD TIMING FOR THOSE

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,204
OF YOU DRIVING DURING SUMMER

4
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:09,306
VACATION.

5
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,542
>> IT IS HARD NOT TO NOTICE,

6
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:12,676
EVEN WHEN YOU CANNOT BEAR TO

7
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:12,976
LOOK.

8
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,878
>> I'M SCARED TO DEATH, BECAUSE

9
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,283
I GET PENNED ON THAT EXTRA MONEY

10
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:20,951
FOR MY CAR AND GROCERIES AND

11
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,419
THINGS LIKE THAT.

12
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,122
>> GIESE PRESSES ON THE RISE,

13
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:27,124
THE CRUNCH FOR COMMUTERS THAT

14
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,525
STRETCHES THE FAMILY BUDGET.

15
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,061
>> WHEN I STARTED GAS WAS $2.20

16
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:33,530
PER GALLON, NOW IT IS UP TO $3

17
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,965
PER GALLON DEPENDING ON WHERE

18
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,533
YOU SHOP, THAT MAKES A BIG

19
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:36,934
DIFFERENCE.

20
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:38,802
>> THE USUAL TALK OF THE SUMMER

21
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:39,536
DRIVING SEASON BEING THE REASON

22
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:42,039
FOR THE RISE IS OUT THERE, BUT

23
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,174
EXPERTS SAY THERE IS MORE AT

24
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:45,576
WORK HERE THAN JUST THE

25
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:46,110
CALENDAR.

26
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,945
CONCERNS ABOUT THE IRAN NUCLEAR

27
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:49,713
DEAL FALLOUT FOR ONE.

28
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:52,316
WHICH SOME SPECULATE COULD TREND

29
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:54,351
GLOBAL SUPPLIES.

30
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:57,287
CONSIDER OILS PLUNGED FROM $100

31
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:59,590
A BARREL TO JUST BELOW $30 A

32
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,091
BARREL IN 2016.

33
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:02,593
AND ACCORDINGLY PRICES FELL, BUT

34
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:04,495
SINCE THEN THEY HAVE BEEN ON THE

35
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:07,331
RISE WITH WEST TEXAS CRUDE, THE

36
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,166
U.S. BENCHMARK TOPPING $71 A

37
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,734
BARREL.

38
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,903
AS IT IS UP 14% FROM THE

39
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:13,971
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

40
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,306
AND MORE PAYING AT THE PUMP WITH

41
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:19,109
THEIR NATIONAL PRICE PER GALLON

42
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,612
AVERAGING $2.84, UP $0.19 OVER

43
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:23,380
LAST MONTH AND $0.51 HIGHER THAN

44
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,816
THIS TIME LAST YEAR.

45
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,918
EXPERTS SAY THAT IS IN PART

46
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:29,119
BECAUSE WALL STREET TRADERS

47
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,120
ANTICIPATED THE PRESIDENT'S

48
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,356
DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE IRAN

49
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:32,656
DEAL.

50
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:34,191
>> THE MARKET WAS PREPARED FOR

51
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,993
THE U.S. TO PULL OUT, A CAMPAIGN

52
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:37,528
PROMISE THAT HE HAS BEEN KNOWN

53
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:39,029
TO DO WHATEVER HE CAN IN HIS

54
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:40,764
POWER WHETHER GOOD OR BAD FOR

55
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:43,100
THE PRESENT SITUATION TO KEEP

56
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,667
THE CAMPAIGN PROMISES.

57
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,170
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO

58
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,671
PROMISED TO RETALIATE AGAINST

59
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,439
THOSE WHO MANIPULATE THE PRICE

60
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:49,940
OF OIL.

61
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,742
TWEETING THAT IT LOOKS LIKE OPEC

62
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:53,177
IS ADDED AGAIN.

63
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:54,812
OIL PRICES ARE ARTIFICIALLY VERY

64
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:55,345
HIGH.

65
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:56,246
NO GOOD.

66
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:58,582
AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

67
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:00,551
>> EXPERTS ARGUE THAT FRANKLY

68
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:01,518
NOT MUCH OF THAT THE PRESIDENT

69
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:03,220
CAN DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM SHORT

70
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,055
OF TAPPING THE NATION'S

71
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:05,589
STRATEGIC RESERVES.

72
00:02:05,589 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS A MOVE THAT THEY SAY
