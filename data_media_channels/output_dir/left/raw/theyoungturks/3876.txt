1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,469
HILLARY CLINTON BOOK IS GETTING
A LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,590
SHE HAS WRITTEN SOME PRETTY
INSANE THINGS.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,710
ONE OF THE MORE INSANE THINGS
THAT WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT WAS A

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,750
PORTION OF HER BOOK WHERE SHE
COMPARES HERSELF TO CERSEI

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,410
LANNISTER FROM GAME OF THRONES.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:34,079
LET ME READ YOU THAT PORTION 

7
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,690
OF
THE BOOK.

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,940
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
HAVE

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,829
NO IDEA WHO SHE IS, SHE IS BEST
KNOWN FOR BEING THE RUTHLESS

10
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,580
POWER-HUNGRY VILLAINOUS WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,620
OF THOUSANDS JUST SO SHE CAN SIT
ON THE IRON THRONE.

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,620
WOW.

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,149
>>NOT THE COMPARISON YOU WANT TO
MAKE.

14
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,810
THAT WAS ONE SCENE WHERE

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,350
YOU FELT SYMPATHY FOR HER.

16
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,090
>>SHAME.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,820
SHAME.

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,559
SHAME.

19
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:21,060
>> BETWEEN CERSEI LANNISTER AND
THEIR RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS YOU HAVE

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,819
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE LESSER OF
TWO EVILS, AND YOU ARE STUCK IN

21
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,460
A PRETTY BAD SITUATION AND YOU
REALLY DID NOT WANT TO GO WITH

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,319
THE RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS BUT CERSEI
LANNISTER WASN'T MUCH OF A

23
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,319
CHOICE EITHER.

24
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,310
IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO BE COOL,
DO A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AND

25
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,209
ASK PEOPLE AROUND YOU IF CERSEI
IS A GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY.

26
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:50,299
IS A TYPICAL FAIL FROM A
CAMPAIGN THAT WAS OTHERWISE

27
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,060
GREAT IF IT WASN'T FOR
BERNIE, JAMES,, RUSSIA, THE

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,259
WEATHER, AND EVERYTHING ELSE â€“
SHE WOULD'VE ONE.

29
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,559
>> EVERY TIME ANYBODY BRINGS
ANYTHING UP AND YOU GUYS LAUGH

30
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:04,340
ABOUT IT, I WILL SAY I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,340
AM NOT IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,209
IF I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND
I'M PUTTING SOMETHING OUT I

33
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,538
WOULD SAY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
BEFORE I SAY IT.

34
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:11,900
IT IS SIMPLE.

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,810
>>IF YOU WATCH IT YOU KNOW
CERSEI IS NOT WHO YOU WANT TO

36
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,170
COMPARE YOURSELF TO.

37
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,830
ALMOST EVERY OTHER PERSON
WATCHES THAT SHOW IN AMERICA, SO

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,549
ASK SOMEONE THAT WATCHES THE
SHOW.

39
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,970
I COMPARE MYSELF TO LITTLE

40
00:02:31,970 --> 00:00:00,000
FINGER BECAUSE I BELIEVE LORD
BAELISH NAILED IT.
