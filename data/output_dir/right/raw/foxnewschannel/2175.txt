13
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,541

PAYOUT.

18
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,249
WE ARE GOING TO BREAK IT ALL

00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:36,950

RUDY ON WHY POTENTIAL TRUMP

INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER'S TEAM

23
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,160
STANDS.

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,296
>> IT FALLS MORE ON US BECAUSE

25
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:50,430
IT'S ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE

26
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,131
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

27
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:52,499
GRANT AN INTERVIEW.

28
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:53,267
IT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT -- IT'S

29
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,569
REALLY SIMPLE.

30
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,170
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN FOLLOW

31
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,704
THIS ALONG WITH ME.

32
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:58,872
ARE THE OBJECTIVE?

33
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:03,143
ARE THEY?

34
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:05,646
RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF THINGS POINT

35
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:06,813
IN THE DIRECTION OF THEY MADE UP

36
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:08,115
THEIR MIND THAT COMEY IS TELLING

37
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,883
THE TRUTH AND NOT THE PRESIDENT.

38
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:11,051
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE QUESTIONS

39
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,521
BUT WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT

40
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:16,156
THINK, WHAT DOES HE FEEL, WHAT

41
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:19,660
IS HE REALLY DESIRE, THOSE ARE

42
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,829
ALL QUESTIONS INTENDED TO TRAP

43
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,699
HIM.

44
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:26,900
>> Laura: LET'S BRING IN BYRON

45
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,669

49
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:35,275
COMMITTEE, WE HAVE A LOT TO GET

50
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,843
THROUGH TONIGHT.

51
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:39,313
I WANT TO START WITH YOU FIRST.

52
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:40,580
I HOPE YOU WERE ABLE TO WATCH

53
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,717
THAT INTERVIEW WITH RUDY.

54
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:46,253
WHAT STRUCK YOU ABOUT WHAT HE

55
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:51,491
SAID ABOUT COMEY, MUELLER, AND

56
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:52,859
THE ENTIRE YEAR OF INVESTIGATION

57
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,695
MANIA.

58
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:56,630
>> MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE'S

59
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,031
GOT IT RIGHT IN MY FRUSTRATION

60
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:01,568
IS THAT WE GONE A YEAR AND THERE

61
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:06,773
IS NO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, AND

62
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:10,509
THIS IS JUST -- THE MUELLER

63
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,880
INVESTIGATION IS NOT OBJECTIVE

64
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,614
AND THAT REALLY RESONATES

65
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,683
BECAUSE IT'S NOT OBJECTIVE.

66
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:17,884
IT'S BIASED AND THEY ARE TRYING

67
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:20,787
TO USE THESE QUESTIONS, IT'S

68
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:25,192
GOING TO BE A TRAP FEST FOR

69
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,294
MUELLER AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

70
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,696
THEY JUST WANT TO GO AFTER

71
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:30,163
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

72
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,898
>> Laura: THERE'S SO MUCH TO

73
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:32,699
UNPACK.

74
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,067
THIS IS WHAT RUDY SAID ABOUT THE

75
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,103
STATE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND

76
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:38,271
WHETHER IT SHOULD WRAP UP, LET'S

77
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:41,942
WATCH.

78
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,878
>> I BELIEVE ATTORNEY GENERAL

79
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,346
SESSIONS, MY GOOD FRIEND AND

80
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:48,882
ROSENSTEIN -- WHO I DON'T KNOW,

81
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:50,317
I BELIEVE IN THE INTEREST OF

82
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,352
JUSTICE THEY SHOULD END THE

83
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:53,487
INVESTIGATION.

84
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,121
THERE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH

85
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,289
GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT.

86
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,090
THE CRIMES HAVE ALL BEEN

87
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,859
COMMITTED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

88
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,294
>> Laura: WOW.

89
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:02,929
THAT WAS A MOMENT, THE CRIMES

90
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:04,965
HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE

91
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:05,532
GOVERNMENT.

92
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:09,136
WHEN I WATCHED, WHY WOULD HE

93
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:09,736
HAVE MADE AN INTERESTING

94
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,272
ATTORNEY GENERAL PICK.

95
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,874
>> I THINK WE'VE SEEN IN THE

96
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:14,674
LAST 24 HOURS SINCE THE RELEASE

97
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:17,344
OF THESE QUESTIONS FROM MUELLER

98
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,879
AND NOW THIS WITH INTERVIEW ON

99
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,813
HANNITY, I THINK WE'VE SEEN A

100
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:26,486
DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THIS CASE.

101
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,187
THE LAWYERS, JOHN DOWD AND TY

102
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:32,392
COBB WHO WERE COUNSELING A MORE

103
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,494
CONCILIATORY APPROACH TOWARD

104
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:35,295
MUELLER, THEY ARE GONE.

105
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,930
WE HAD THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER GO

106
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,299
ON TV FOR AN HOUR.

107
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,536
HE DIDN'T SEE DOWD OR COBB DOING

108
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:42,836
THAT.

109
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:44,571
IF THE ONE THING THAT RUDY SAYS,

110
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,707
HE THINKS THE ODDS ARE AGAINST

111
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,242
PRESIDENT TRUMP SITTING DOWN AND

112
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,578
TALKING WITH MUELLER.

113
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:52,312
THEY MADE A LOT OF NEWS IN THE

114
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:56,883
LAST 24 HOURS.

115
00:03:56,883 --> 00:04:00,854
>> Laura: HERE'S THE DEAL.

116
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:04,091
WE HAVE HAD A STRING OF

117
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,559
ATTORNEYS FOR THE PRESIDENT, TY

118
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,761
COBB IS LEAVING AT THE END OF

119
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:08,395
MAY.

120
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:12,499
JOHN DOWD EXITED IN MARCH.

121
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:14,201
THERE STILL IS MARTY AND JANE

122
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,136
RASKIN RECENTLY BROUGHT ON THE

123
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,471
TEAM.

124
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,906
CASTLE WITS, HIS PERSONAL

125
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:20,673
ATTORNEY, ONE OF HIS PERSONAL

126
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:23,143
ATTORNEYS, HE WAS IN AND OUT

127
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:23,944
BRIEFLY.

128
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,513
NOW THEY BRING IN EMMETT FLOOD.

129
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:27,781
IN FULL DISCLOSURE, WE WERE

130
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:32,619
COCLERKS BACK IN THE DAY, YOU

131
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,754
SEE HIM ON THE UPPER LEFT-HAND

132
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:35,355
CORNER.

133
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:37,457
FLOOD IS THE KIND OF ATTORNEY

134
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:38,959
WHO IS NOT GOING TO GIVE A LOT

135
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,993
OF INTERVIEWS ON TELEVISION,

136
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,428
HE'S ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE

137
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,263
I KNOW.

138
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:46,666
ONE OF THE FINEST PEOPLE I KNOW.

139
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,501
JUST TOP-NOTCH, THE KIND OF

140
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,268
PERSON THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN IN

141
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:50,804
FRONT AND RIGHT FROM THE VERY

142
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,140
BEGINNING.

143
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,111
HE WORKED FOR CLINTON DURING THE

144
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,613
IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION, HE'S

145
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,715
AT WILLIAMS AND CONNELLY.

146
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:02,916
THIS DOES TELL YOU THAT THE

147
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,486
TRUMP TEAM HAS GOTTEN SERIOUS.

148
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:10,423
HE'S GOING TO GO FOR THE BIG

149
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,959
GET.

150
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,295
>> IT WASN'T JUST CLINTON, HE

151
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:18,398
ALSO REPRESENTED DICK CHENEY IN

152
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:20,300
PRIVATE PRACTICE AND HE ALSO

153
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,868
REPRESENTED THE WHITE HOUSE

154
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:22,702
COUNSEL OFFICE UNDER

155
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:23,336
INVESTIGATION FOR THE BUSH

156
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:26,873
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL.

157
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:27,541
HE'S GOT EXPERIENCE IN BOTH

158
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:31,845
TIMES OF ADMINISTRATION.

159
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,914
SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY WITH

160
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:35,348
IMPEACHMENT EXPERIENCE, THE

161
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:36,683
SCALES HAVE FALLEN AND THEY

162
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:37,384
REALIZE THE STAKES ARE ABOUT

163
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,085
IMPEACHMENT HERE.

164
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:41,288
WHEN YOU SEE THE QUESTIONS IN

165
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:42,489
THE MUELLER LEAKS.

166
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:43,557
THEY ARE NOT ABOUT ANY CRIME THE

167
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,692
PRESIDENT MAY HAVE COMMITTED,

168
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:46,860
IT'S CLEARLY DOING SOME FREE

169
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,863
RESEARCH FOR THE DEMOCRATS, IT

170
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,199
COULD NOT BE CLEARER.

171
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,901
I'M GLAD AS A SUPPORTER OF THE

172
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:55,602
PRESIDENT, TO SEE THEY FINALLY

173
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,704
WOKE UP.

174
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,739
THE RUDY GIULIANI INTERVIEW, IT

175
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,775
WAS VERY ENCOURAGING TO ME, TO

176
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,977
SEE SOMEBODY WITH REALITY CHECKS

177
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:09,449
HERE.

178
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,118
WE'VE SEEN THE CONDUCT THAT HAS

179
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,320
BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THE

180
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,820
PRESIDENT SO FAR.

181
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,257
I FEEL MUCH MORE REASSURED TO

182
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,492
SEEING THEM GIRDING FOR BATTLE

183
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:23,263
HERE.

184
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,397
>> Laura: THE BIG NEWS

ROSENSTEIN, IT WAS KIND OF A

188
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,010
BRUSHOFF OF ROSENSTEIN JUST

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,846

HOUSE AND RUDY HIMSELF SAID THIS

193
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:46,886
ABOUT COMEY, DEVASTATING.

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,926
THE PRESIDENT.

197
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:56,429
SORRY JIM, YOU'RE A LIAR.

198
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,265
A DISGRACEFUL LIAR.

199
00:06:58,265 --> 00:06:59,566
EVERY FBI AGENT IN AMERICA HAS

200
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,434
HIS HEAD DOWN BECAUSE OF YOU.

201
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,969
IT WOULD'VE BEEN GOOD FOR GOD IF

202
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,839
GOD WOULD'VE KEPT YOU OUT OF

203
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,477
BEING HEAD OF THE FBI.

204
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:13,046
>> AMEN TO THAT, THAT'S ONE OF

205
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,147
THE COMMENTS WHEN HE SAYS THAT I

206
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,449
STAND UP AND CHEER.

207
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:17,717
WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT, WE'VE

208
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:20,220
BEEN TRYING TO MAKE IT CLEAR.

209
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,987
THANK GOODNESS FOR RUDY GIULIANI

210
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:24,257
SAYING THAT.

211
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,492
MR. COMEY HAS BEEN A DISGRACE.

212
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:28,061
TREY GOWDY SAID GREAT.

213
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,229
NOBODY HAS BROUGHT MORE

214
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,264
DISREPUTE ON THE FBI THAN JAMES

215
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:32,032
COMEY.

216
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,867
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AS A

217
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:34,934
NATION, I CAN'T GO TO

00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,269
CONSTITUENTS -- THEY ARE ALL

219
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,471
UPSET, WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

220
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,140
COMEY, WHY ISN'T HE BEHIND BARS,

221
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,108
HE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED

222
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,177
HIMSELF.

223
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:48,148
>> Laura: WE HAVE THIS MOMENT

224
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:48,615
ABOUT EXTORTION.

225
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:52,852
WHEN ROD ROSENSTEIN YESTERDAY

226
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:53,853
SAID WE AREN'T GOING TO BE

227
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:54,954

OFFICIAL AND FRED WERTHEIMER AT

235
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,638
THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION SAYING

00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,039
THE FREEDOM CAUCUS AND THE

237
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,441
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING THE

238
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,376
BIDDING OF THE PRESIDENT, TRYING

239
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:17,677
TO INTIMIDATE THE SPECIAL

240
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,046
COUNSEL'S OFFICE -- IT'S A

241
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,048
DISGRACE.

242
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,650
IF IT WAS HOT BEFORE, IT'S BEING

243
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,052
RAMPED UP NOW ON BOTH SIDES.

244
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,854
>> DOES ART GO TO WAR WORDS, THE

245
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,423
EXTORTION THING.

246
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:31,191
PEOPLE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

247
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,092
WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE

248
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,027
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO FEEL

249
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:36,229
THEY'VE GIVEN TOO MUCH TO

250
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,499
CONGRESS.

251
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:40,433
I CANNOT SAY THE JUSTICE

252
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:41,368
DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAND OVER

253
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,336
EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT TO

254
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:43,703
CONGRESS.

255
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:46,706
ROSENSTEIN WOULD HAVE MORE

256
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:51,211
CREDIBILITY TODAY IF HE HAD NOT

257
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,445
MADE GETTING DOCUMENTS LIKE

00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,213
PULLING TEETH FOR CONGRESS OVER

259
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,815
THE LAST YEAR.

260
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,217
PAUL RYAN IS NOT A BIG WARRIOR

261
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:58,952
IN THIS KIND OF THING AND HE

262
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:01,354
SAID THE FBI WAS A WAS

263
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,088
STONEWALLING CONGRESS, THE HOUSE

264
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,623
OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THIS.

265
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:04,924
THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO

266
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:06,159
TALK NOW THAT THEY ARE

267
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,528
COMPLAINING.

268
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:09,529
>> Laura: GIULIANI SAID WHEN

269
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:14,367
HE WAS ASKED BY HANNITY, OTHER

270
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,437
TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE IN THIS

271
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:18,505
COUNTRY, HE SAID ONE FOR

272
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:22,442
HILLARY, ONE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

273
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:23,243
HE IS THE LAWYER REPRESENTING

274
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,344
THE PRESIDENT BUT FOR A LOT OF

275
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:25,211
AMERICANS WHO ARE WATCHING

276
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,747

YOU GET TO DO AN INTERVIEW, COZY

280
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:36,823
BEFORE THE FOURTH OF JULY.

281
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,725
NO TRANSCRIPT TAKEN, NEVER UNDER

282
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,493
OATH AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS

283
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,194
HAPPENED ON THE OTHER SIDE TO

284
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:43,630
THIS PRESIDENT.

285
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,664
FOR A YEAR WITH ALL THIS

286
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,466
IMPORTANT STUFF HAPPENING IN THE

287
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,835
WORLD, HE HAS BEEN HOUNDED BY

288
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:49,602
HIS SPECIAL COUNSEL WHOSE OFFICE

289
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:53,039
IS POPULATED BY PARTISAN WOULD

290
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,607
NOT ONLY ARE JUST DEMOCRATS BUT

291
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,410
HAVE AN ANIMUS TOWARD THIS

292
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,011
PRESIDENT.

293
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:58,778
I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I HEARD RUDY

294
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:02,248
SAY THAT, I HAVE TO SAY I AGREE,

295
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:05,418
ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THAT.

296
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,220
>> I WOULD SAY THERE ARE THREE

297
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,822
SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT.

298
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,590
THERE'S ONE FOR HILLARY, THERE'S

299
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,291
ONE FOR NORMAL PEOPLE IN THE

300
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,594
WORLD AND THERE'S ONE FOR

301
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:16,029
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

302
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,899
FROM DAY ONE, FROM KLAPPER

303
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,367
TELLING COMEY TO GO BRIEF THE

304
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:23,336
PRESIDENT ON THIS NONEXISTENT

305
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:32,245
RUSSIAN DRAMA, TO THE INCIDENT

306
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,346
THAT GIULIANI RECOUNTED, HE WAS

307
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:37,417
INTERVIEWED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

308
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,751
THE JOB OF FBI DIRECTOR WITH

309
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:42,622
ROSENSTEIN SITTING NEXT TO HIM.

310
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:44,657
KNOWING THE PRESIDENT HAS

311
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,426
REJECTED HIM FROM THAT JOB.

312
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:49,529
THE DECK HAS BEEN STACKED WITH

313
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,433
AXES TO GRIND.

314
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,868
WHEN ROSENSTEIN'S ANGRY WORDS

315
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:58,171
CAME OUT AND MADE IT PERSONAL,

316
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,606
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

317
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:06,613
HE WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT.

318
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:08,915
I WAS SHOCKED AND JUST LIKE FBI

319
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:09,616
AGENTS ARE HANGING THEIR HEADS

320
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:12,085
IN SHAME, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT

321
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:13,219
OF GOOD ATTORNEYS AT THE

322
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,454
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WERE

323
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,221
STUNNED.

324
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:16,623
THAT PEOPLE ARE PICKING A FIGHT

325
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,892
WITH THEIR BOSSES LIKE THIS ON

326
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:19,826
TELEVISION.

327
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,027
>> Laura: I TWEETED THIS A

328
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,028
COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO BUT I

329
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,596
THINK ONE OF THE BIG MOMENTS IN

330
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:27,500
THIS INTERVIEW WAS WHEN GIULIANI

331
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,502
REFERENCE OF STORMY DANIELS

332
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:30,103
ISSUE.

333
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,070
I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE

334
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,907
SOUND BITE, LET'S WATCH.

335
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:36,609
>> SOMETHING DO WITH PAYING SOME

336
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,411
STORMY DANIELS WOMAN 130,000,

337
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,313
WHICH IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE

338
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:43,816
PERFECTLY LEGAL.

339
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,018
THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN

340
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:45,718
MONEY, I'M GIVING YOU A FACT

341
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:48,087
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

342
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,190
IT'S NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY.

343
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,027
NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION.

344
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,062
>> Sean: THEY FUNNELED THROUGH

345
00:11:56,062 --> 00:12:02,969
A LAW FIRM.

346
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,003
AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID IT.

347
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,238
>> Laura: ON APRIL 6TH, THIS

348
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:09,442
WAS THE EXCHANGE.

349
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,945
>> DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

350
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,980
$130,000 PAYMENT TO STORMY

351
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,847
DANIELS?

352
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:24,991
THEN WHY DID --

353
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:29,262
>> YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL.

354
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:30,663
>> Laura: IT'S HARD TO HEAR

355
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:33,633
THERE BUT HE SAID NO, I DIDN'T

356
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,802
KNOW ABOUT IT, YOU'RE GOING TO

357
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:36,636
HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL COHEN ABOUT

358
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,204
THE PAYMENT.

359
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:38,938
PUTTING MY LEGAL HAT ON DURING

360
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:46,212
THE BREAK, -- DID HE PAY IT

361
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,014
AFTER APRIL 6TH?

362
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:48,748
THAT I'M OF THE LEFT IS JUMPING

363
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:52,418
ALL OVER THAT SAYING HE DIDN'T

364
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:53,386
KNOW, RUDY IS ON TV, WHAT'S

365
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,422
GOING ON?

366
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:58,625
>> THESE ARE REAL QUESTIONS, HE

367
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,359
GAVE US A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

368
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,628
VERSION OF THIS.

369
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:02,362
>> Laura: UNLESS THE PRESIDENT

370
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:14,907
PAID IT AFTER SIXTH.

371
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:15,441
PAID IT AFTER SIXTH.

372
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,676
HE KNOWS THAT'S WHERE IT'S

373
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:16,976
GOING.

374
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,811
>> IT APPEARS TO BE THE REAL

375
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,713
CONCERN IS THAT THERE WOULD BE

376
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:21,414
