00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,242
THE LIBERAL MEDIA IS ONCE AGAIN

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,977
WHIPPING ITSELF INTO A FRENZY

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,746
OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

5
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:14,647
FIRST UP, AMID THE PRESIDENTS

6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,415

OFFICE.

12
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,960
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY, MANY

13
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,130
WAYS THIS PRESIDENT HAS SHOWN US

14
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:32,165
THAT HE'S NOT FIT, POSSIBLY NOT

15
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,867
EVEN WELL.

16
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,834
YOU ARE WORKING FOR A PRESIDENT

17
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,303
WHO IS NOT FIT TO LEAD WHO IS

18
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,906
GOING TO DO SOMETHING CRAZY IN 5

00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:39,939

TOMORROW.

36
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,110
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO HEAR

37
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,113
FROM HIM TO START THINKING 25TH

38
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,282
AMENDMENT OR SOMETHING ELSE?

39
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,316
>> Jesse: CNN'S DON LEMON

40
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,685
PILING ON WITH HIS USUAL

41
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,686
PERSONAL ATTACKS.

42
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,089
>> DOES HE OWN A MIRROR?

43
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,790
HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

44
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,060
GAINING WEIGHT.

45
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:00,693
HOW PEOPLE LOOK.

46
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,762
THIS HE OWN A MIRROR THAT

47
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,564
DOESN'T HAVE VASELINE OVER IT OR

48
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,298
A CLOTH?

49
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,500
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS LOOK IN THE

50
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:07,901
MIRROR.

51
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,369
DONALD TRUMP IS NO PRIZE, AND IF

52
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,304
I WERE HIM, NOT THAT I'M ONE

53
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,106
EITHER, I WOULD KEEP MY THOUGHTS

54
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,908
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S LOOKS TO

55
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:15,275
MYSELF.

56
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,276
>> Jesse: THAT'S NOT ALL.

57
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:16,576
SOME.

58
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,978
SOME IN THE MEDIA TRYING TO SPIN

59
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,680
ELIZABETH WARREN'S DISASTROUS

60
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,049
DNA REVEAL BY USING IT TO

61
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,716
PROTECT TRUMP.

62
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,852
>> IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT THE

63
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,088
VERACITY OF HER STATEMENT.

64
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,589
IT'S ULTIMATELY A DOG WHISTLE

65
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,459
THAT PLAYS INTO THE GRIEVANCES

66
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,127
OF HIS BASE, HIS OVERWHELMINGLY

67
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,763
WHITE BASS, AND IT GOES INTO

68
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,065
MULTIPLE THEMES THAT ARE AT

69
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,300
ISSUE FOR CONSERVATIVES,

70
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,034
PREDOMINATELY AROUND AFFIRMATIVE

71
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,302
ACTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE

72
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,403
PEOPLE SORT OF CHEATING THE

73
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,271
SYSTEM BY CLAIMING TO BE

74
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:45,672
MINORITIES.

75
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,407
>> Jesse: THE ARCHITECT OF THE

76
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:51,344
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, FORMER OBAMA

77
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,981
ADVISOR BEN RHODES, THIS TALKING

78
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,485
POINT ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF

79
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,219
"THE WASHINGTON POST" COLUMNIST.

80
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,353
>> THE SAUDIS WANT TO SEND THE

81
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,122
MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE NOT SAFE

82
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,090
ANYWHERE IF YOU CRITICIZE US.

83
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,258
THE MESSAGE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

84
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,594
SENDING US THAT THERE'S NO

85
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,462
CONSEQUENCES.

86
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,297
VALUES LIKE FREEDOM OF SPEECH

87
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,765
AND DISSENT, SUDDENLY THEY ARE

88
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,467
VERY ENDANGERED AROUND THE

89
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:14,767
WORLD.

90
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,704
THAT'S A LINE I THINK IT'S

91
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:18,138
GETTING WORSE.

92
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,806
>> Jesse: LET'S PICK UP ON

93
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:20,707
WHAT BEN RHODES SAID.

94
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,709
I THINK IT'S PRETTY

95
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,711
IRRESPONSIBLE TO LINK

96
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:25,445
"THE WASHINGTON POST" COLUMNIST

97
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,179
DEATH WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WAR

98
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,613
ON THE MEDIA.

99
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,882
THAT'S JUST RHETORIC.

100
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:32,485
JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN DYING IN

101
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,786
MEXICO FOR DECADES, BEFORE

102
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:34,454
DONALD TRUMP STARTED SAYING

103
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,089
THINGS LIKE THIS.

104
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,458
DO YOU THINK HE'S RESPONSIBLE

105
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,693
FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST"

106
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,194
BLOGGER'S DEMISE?

107
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,695
>> Juan: NO.

108
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,530
>> Jesse: WHY WOULD HE SAY

109
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,032
THAT?

110
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,902
>> Juan: YOU HAVE PRESS UNDER

111
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,703
FIRE IN SO MANY AREAS OF THE

112
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:51,137
WORLD.

113
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:51,638
YOU CITED MEXICO.

114
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,141
I'VE BEEN TO MEXICO AS A GUEST

115
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,110
OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT TALK

116
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,311
ABOUT THREATS AGAIN JOURNALISTS.

117
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,312
YOU SEE IT IN TURKEY.

118
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,314
YOU SEE IT THROUGHOUT MUCH OF

119
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,849
THE WORLD.

120
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,951
WE KNOW ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S

121
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:05,685
ATTITUDE BUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT

122
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,920
OF THE UNITED STATES WHO SHOULD

123
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,488
BE STANDING UP FOR DEMOCRATIC

124
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,790
VALUES, PRESS FREEDOM, FREEDOM

125
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,159
OF DISSENT, SAYS THAT THE PRESS

126
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,128
IN HIS COUNTRY IS THE ENEMY OF

127
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:15,995
THE PEOPLE, PERPETRATING FAKE

128
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:19,499
NEWS, I THINK IT DOES EMPOWER

129
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,067
THE AUTOCRATS ELSEWHERE TO SAY

130
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,435
WELL, IT'S JUST LIKE THE

131
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,303
UNITED STATES.

132
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,205
WE ARE JUST GOING AFTER THEM THE

133
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:25,805
WAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE

134
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,707
UNITED STATES GOES AFTER IT.

135
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,208
IT'S NOT HEALTHY.

136
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,275
>> Jesse: I DON'T KNOW IF

137
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,910
THAT'S THE WAY TO LINK IT.

138
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,011
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DRAW THAT

139
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,913
KIND OF CONNECTION.

140
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,948
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE IT'S

141
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,884
EMPOWERED ANYBODY.

142
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,852
THE PRESIDENT LOVES THE PRESS,

143
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,920
MORGAN.

144
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:41,588
HE COURTS THEM FANATICALLY.

145
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,857
HE JUST DID AN INTERVIEW WITH

146
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,326
BLOOMBERG, AP, FOX NEWS, AND

147
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:50,663
6060 MINUTES WITHIN A WEEK.

148
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,865
HE'S FEEDING THEM ALL THE TIME.

149
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,900
HE LOVES THE PRESS.

150
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,235
>> Morgan: WHEN THE PRESIDENT

151
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,171
FIRST CAME OUT, WHEN THIS STORY

152
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,272
FIRST CAME OUT ABOUT KHASHOGGI,

153
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,073
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THE

154
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,108
PRESIDENT SAID WAS HOW HE

155
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:02,976
MENTIONED THAT IT WAS UPSETTING

156
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,344
THAT HE WAS A JOURNALIST AND

157
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,044
THAT THIS HAPPENED TO HIM.

158
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,280
I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

159
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,881
GOING ON HERE IN THIS SPECIFIC

160
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,350
CASE IS THERE'S A LOT GOING ON

161
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,718
BEHIND THE SCENES.

162
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,986
THE COUNTRY TEAM IN THESE

163
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:13,987
EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES, THEY

164
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,421
ARE WORKING TOGETHER.

165
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,590
WE HAVE LEGAL ATTACHES AND ALL

166
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,892
THESE CONSULATES AND EMBASSIES

167
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:20,692
WORKING WITH OTHER AGENCIES

168
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,995
GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

169
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,063
I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING

170
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,065
TO GIVE SPACE TO OUR GOVERNMENT

171
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:26,866
AND THE TURKISH AND SAUDI

172
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,167
GOVERNMENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

173
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,703
ACTUALLY GOES ON AND HOLD PEOPLE

174
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:31,104
ACCOUNTABLE.

175
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,505
>> Jesse: WE HEARD ALL OF THE

176
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,873
SOUND AT THE TOP.

177
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,742
IT'S ALL SPIN.

178
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,510
SPIN ON THE MIDDLE EAST, SPIN ON

179
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,011
ELIZABETH WARREN.

180
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,847
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE SPIN FROM

181
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:41,314
MIKA BRZEZINSKI.

182
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:44,517
DO THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ANY PLANS

183
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,151
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

184
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,686
>> Dana: ONE OF THE THINGS

185
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,022
THAT'S HURTING THEM, 19 DAYS

186
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,256
UNTIL THE MIDTERMS,

187
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,324
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CONSUMING ALL

188
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,926
THE OXYGEN IN THE MEDIA.

189
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:54,927
BASICALLY WHAT HE'S DECIDED HE'S

190
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,628
GOING TO FLOOD THE ZONE AND

191
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,264
NOBODY ELSE CAN GET ON

192
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,532
TELEVISION UNLESS THEY ARE

193
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,667
TALKING ABOUT HIM AND TALKING

194
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,268
ABOUT HIM IN SOME WAY THAT WOULD

195
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,137
BE DEROGATORY BECAUSE THAT WOULD

196
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:04,837
ACTUALLY GET THEM HEADLINES.

197
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,674
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

198
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,442
HE HAS SAID IN ONE OF THOSE

199
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,076
INTERVIEWS HE DOESN'T

200
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,678
NECESSARILY THINK THE MIDTERMS

201
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,680
ARE A REFERENDUM ON HIM.

202
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,081
HE HAS SET OTHERWISE IN THE

203
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:15,682
PAST.

204
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:16,916
HE SAYS HE WELCOMES IT BEING

205
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,319
ABOUT HIM BUT HIS ACTIONS SHOW

206
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,719
DIFFERENTLY.

207
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,220
HE KNOWS IF HE'S OUT THERE AND

208
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,856
HE'S DRIVING NEWS MEDIA AND HIS

209
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:28,895
VOTERS GET ENGAGED, THAT'S --

210
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,463
THAT MAKES RED STATE DEMOCRATS

211
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,064
VERY NERVOUS.

212
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,899
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE THE

213
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,733
MAJORITY OF TRUMP VOTERS COMING

214
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,902
OUT THOSE RED STATES, THE SENATE

215
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,071
DEMOCRATS UP FOR REELECTION WILL

216
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:38,504
LOSE.

217
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,306
>> Juan: YOUR POINT IS WHEN HE

218
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,909
SAYS HORSE FACE, HE IS EXCITING

219
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,276
HIS BASE?

220
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,311
>> Dana: NO, I DIDN'T SAY

221
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:45,912
THAT.

222
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,980
HE'S DOING ALL SORTS OF MEDIA.

223
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,716
HE SAID SO MANY THINGS ON SO

224
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:50,483
MANY DIFFERENT TOPICS.

225
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,752
HE SAID THE FED IS THE BIGGEST

226
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:53,353
THREAT.

227
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,020
THERE'S A MILLION THREADS.

228
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,689
YOU COULD PULL ANY OF THEM.

229
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,924
MY POINT IS HE IS CONSUMING ALL

230
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,059
THE OXYGEN AND THAT BY TOMORROW

231
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,361
MORNING, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER

232
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,363
OUTRAGE THAT THEY CAN TALK

233
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:03,663
ABOUT.

234
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,765
>> Juan: I THINK IS BAD TIMING

235
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,035
FOR REPUBLICANS TO SUDDENLY BE

236
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:09,869
INSULTING --

237
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,336
AMERICAN WOMEN.

238
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,706
>> Dana: IT MIGHT BE BAD FOR

239
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,674
HIM IN-HOUSE SUBURBAN DISTRICTS.

240
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,676
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD FOR HIM

241
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:17,944
TO BE ON THE NEWS ALL THE TIME

242
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,480
IF YOU'RE A RED STATE REPUBLICAN

243
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,116
TRYING TO UNSEAT A DEMOCRAT.

244
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,751
>> Greg: I DON'T THINK ANY

245
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,919
DEMOCRAT CAN CRITICIZE ANYONE

246
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,889
ABOUT BAD TIMING, AFTER THE

247
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,423
LIVES WARREN THING.

248
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:35,661
YOU BROUGHT UP MIKA, BEN RHODES,

249
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:39,065
DON LEMON.

250
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,433
MORNING JOE REMINDS ME OF A

251
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,135
POLITICAL TALK SHOW THAT YOU SEE

252
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:46,005
WITHIN A TV SHOW, LIKE "HOUSE OF

253
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:46,305
CARDS.

254
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,073
IT'S ENTIRELY FABRICATED AND

255
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:47,373
PHONY.

256
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,675
IT HAS THE SAME FACES DURING THE

257
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,743
SAME THING.

258
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,212
ALMOST LIKE IT IS SCRIPTED FOR

259
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,414
ANOTHER SHOW.

260
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,349
MIKA, GOD LOVE HER, BUT SHE IS

261
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,618
THE DEFINITION OF STUPIDITY.

262
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,952
SHE IS ETERNALLY SHOCKED BY

263
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,221
SOMETHING THAT THE REST OF

264
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,689
AMERICA IS USED TOO.

265
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,458
FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S LIKE GOING TO

266
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,693
GET INDIAN FOOD AND COMPLAINING

267
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,728
THAT IT'S SPICY.

268
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,663
IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING TO SEE A

269
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,298
QUINTON TARANTINO FILM AND WHEN

270
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,967
YOU LEAVE, GO, MY GOD, THAT WAS

271
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:15,902
VIOLENT.

272
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,303
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

273
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,905
>> Jesse: SHE KNOWS SO BETTER

274
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,472
THAN ANYBODY.

275
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,073
>> Greg: THE IRONY AND SHE

276
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,109
HELPED GET HIM ELECTED.

277
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,012
SHE GIVE HIM MORE OXYGEN THAN

278
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:26,345
ANYBODY.

279
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,079
THERE IS A PROFESSOR WHO BROUGHT

280
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,714
UP A REALLY GOOD WAY TO DESCRIBE

281
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,116
IT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

282
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,118
MEDIA AND THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED

283
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,319
FOR TRUMP.

284
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,321
THE MEDIA EXCESSES OVER THE

285
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,623
PERIPHERAL, THAT MEANS WORDS,

286
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,224
MANNER, STYLE.

287
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,292
THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP

288
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,893
CAN TOLERATE ALL THAT BECAUSE

289
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,829
THEY FOCUS ON THE SUBSTANCE

290
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,499
WHICH IS JOBS, ECONOMY, PEACE IN

291
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,534
THE KOREAS, THE SUPREME COURT,

292
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,368
WORLD'S MOST COMPETITIVE

293
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,136
ECONOMY.

294
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:50,670
BEAT OUT SINGAPORE.

295
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,473
YOU HAVE BEN RHODES.

296
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,208
>> Jesse: TAKE THAT,

297
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:55,708
SINGAPORE.

298
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,909
>> Greg: ALL ROADS LEAD TO

299
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,276
FAILURE.

300
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,879
HE HAS NO RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT

301
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,246
SECURITY.

302
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,647
HIS NAIVE ARROGANCE GAVE US

303
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,082
TRUMP BECAUSE THEY CREATED A

304
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,350
FOREIGN POLICY THAT SENT OUR

305
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,351
LEADERS AROUND SAYING WE ARE

306
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,320
SORRY AND THEN WE HAVE A LEADER

307
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,788
THAT GETS ELECTED THAT SAYS NO,

308
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,690
WE ARE NOT.

309
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,891
THERE IS DIRECT LINKAGE.

310
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,392
LASTLY, LEMON HAS NO RIGHT TO

311
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,461
TALK ABOUT ANYTHING GIVEN THE

312
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,463
FACT THAT HE BASICALLY SNICKERED

313
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:21,200
THROUGHOUT THE SEGMENT MOCKING

314
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:21,834
KANYE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND

315
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,102
CALLING HIM A BUNCH OF

316
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,103
DISGUSTING NAMES.

317
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,738
HE SAID TRUMP COULD USE A

318
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:26,138
MIRROR.

319
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,140
I'M SURE LEMON MUST HAVE 100 OF

320
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,408
THEM AT HOME.

321
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,912
>> Jesse: TV IS A PRETTY

322
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,113
AESTHETICALLY ORIENTED INDUSTRY.

323
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,883
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ON TV CAN

324
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,084
TALK ABOUT LOOKS.

325
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,385
>> Greg: I CAN.

326
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,320
>> Jesse: GREG, YOU ARE THE

327
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,457
MOST HANDSOME MAN ON FOX NEWS.

328
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,894
>> Juan: GREG, DON'T YOU THINK

329
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,895
THESE COMMENTS ARE ADOLESCENT?

330
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,096
YOU SAY TRUMP SUPPORTERS

331
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,230
DISMISSED -- NOT A BIG DEAL BUT

332
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,499
I THINK THE FACT THAT HE KEEPS

333
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,501
GOING AFTER AMERICAN WOMEN IN

334
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,736
TERMS OF THEIR LOOKS.

335
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:57,503
AT SOME POINT --

336
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,338
>> Greg: YOU ARE WRONG.

337
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,773
HE GOES AFTER EVERYONE.

338
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,974
HE GOES AFTER MEN, WOMEN.

339
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,378
I AM SURE HE IS GONE AFTER

340
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,847
CHILDREN AS WELL.

341
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,383
ANIMALS.

342
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,551
TED CRUZ.

343
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,520
>> Jesse: REMEMBER ROMNEY

344
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,721
WALKS LIKE A PENGUIN?

345
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,690
>> Greg: HE WASN'T FAR OFF ON

346
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:17,990
THAT.

347
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:18,658
>> Juan: WHEN I WAS SAYING

348
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,194
IT'S ABOUT WOMEN'S LOOKS.

349
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,597
>> Greg: HE WILL MAKE FUN OF

350
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,731
EVERYTHING.

351
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,867
HE DOESN'T CENSOR.

352
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,735
>> Jesse: I THINK WOMEN ARE

353
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,137
VERY UPTIGHT ABOUT THEIR LOOKS

354
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:35,474
AND IF I SAY --

355
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,075
>> Dana: WEIGHT.

356
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,510
>> Jesse: I AM UPTIGHT ABOUT

357
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,078
MY LOOKS.

358
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,114
>> Greg: HOW DOES THAT MAKE

359
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,482
YOU FEEL, DANA?

360
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,817
ARE YOU UPTIGHT ABOUT YOUR

361
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:48,487
LOOKS, MORGAN?

362
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,288
THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION.

363
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,524
>> Morgan: I THINK EVERYONE

364
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,492
WAS ON TELEVISION --

365
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,060
STARING IN THE MIRROR.

366
00:09:54,061 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Greg: HOW CAN I NOT STARE
