00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
I can't escape<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that me wanting</font>

other people to like me is somehow week

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I should just make whatever I</font>

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make and not care about what</font>

help but care about what you think

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,210
because worrying whatever people think

of me has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> my whole life that was a</font>

this was a very candid video by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlie</font>

17
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,090
and from watching all of the responses

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,950
and all of the discussion that seems to

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">be happening amongst</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube's at the</font>

moment he isn't the only person who's

been feeling like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we are</font>

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially susceptible to these feelings</font>

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,719
of inadequacy and these feelings of not

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,149
being good enough because we are so

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,010
personally invested in personally

engaged in the products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we create</font>

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,000
Michael Aranda posted a response to this

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,630
video saying that he was scared too and

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,259
that anybody who is involved in the

selling one's personality industry

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,460
anyone who is in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of field is</font>

33

feel this way and to a certain extent I

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,820
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is true I also agree with him</font>

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,930
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a human thing in our very</font>

core as biological beings it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font>

our survival response to want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

loved to want to fit into groups and

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,710
therefore we want to be liked by people

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,399
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that Charlie and me and the</font>

rosianna made a response to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlie's</font>

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,179
disagreed with Michael Aranda in that

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,800
she felt that this outpouring of<font color="#CCCCCC"> knee</font>

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,600
needing to be accepted isn't just a

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,310
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it is very specifically a</font>

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube focused condition she cited the</font>

53
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,120
fact that a lot of people have been

institutionalized by the site the<font color="#CCCCCC"> site</font>

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,190
isn't what a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us remember it being</font>

rough<font color="#E5E5E5"> God five years ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now when I</font>

started people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are encouraged to stick</font>

to schedules to create on demand to be

<font color="#E5E5E5">coming to me I haven't posted a video in</font>

62
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,780
a fair few months a lot of this is down

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the fact that technologically I</font>

64
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,850
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to a lot of it has</font>

65
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,340
been down to laziness a lot of it has

66
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,500
been down to the fact that I'm moving

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,090
around the world like nobody's business

68
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,030
and the places in the world that I live

69
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,340
don't always allow you to access<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

70
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,160
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deny that a certain</font>

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,330
part of me is also very aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

72
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,810
long time ago I used to get a good

73
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,520
number of hits and I don't get them any

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,560
more and part of me feels that either

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,410
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are bored of me people don't like</font>

76
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,110
the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I create and part of me</font>

77
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,670
has actively tried to sidestep this by

78
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,340
not creating blogs anymore I actively

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,700
decided at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> point I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

80
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,520
probably around 2008 to stop making

81
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,340
vlogs and to make debate videos to turn

82
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,350
rhyming voyages into a channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

83
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,400
people converged and could voice their

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,230
opinions it was no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be a</font>

85
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,000
personal vessel for me I deleted all of

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,130
my personal videos all of the videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

87
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,019
me dancing around like a twat and lip

88
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,580
syncing and I made this into very much a

89
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,590
channel with a non-personal folk

90
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,169
yes I was the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who was uploading</font>

91
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,220
the videos but I was actively avoiding I

92
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,500
was actively avoiding investing too much

93
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,419
of myself into it and so reducing the

94
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,360
amount that i have posted in the past

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,220
two or three years has been easier and

96
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,690
so when I decided to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or I</font>

97
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,520
wanted to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and the numbers were</font>

98
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,830
significantly lower in terms of the

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,620
people who watched me that was a bit of

100
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">a kick in the nuts and it's not your</font>

101
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">fault but a certain amount of it is</font>

102
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,740
probably human nature a certain amount

103
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,479
of it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the fact that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am a</font>

104
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,450
youtuber and I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> personally invested no</font>

105
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,250
matter how impersonal I try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

106
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,080
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this channel I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> personally</font>

107
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,600
invested in what I create here so ladies

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and gentlemen let me know what you think</font>

109
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,210
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what wine with oranges is for</font>

110
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,370
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you do you side with</font>

111
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,340
rosianna do you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

112
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,210
specifically a youtuber trait is it

113
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,510
because we are investing so much of

114
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,070
ourselves personally into the content

115
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we create is it because we are now</font>

116
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,930
turning ourselves into brands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

117
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,349
businesses that we may be feel the way

118
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,389
that Charlie does or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you agree with</font>

119
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michael Aranda in the fact that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

120
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">just something that's innately human is</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we all feel to a</font>
