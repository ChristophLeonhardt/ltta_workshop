23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,940
community but Ben Cooke seems to have

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,859
done that with his becoming youtube

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,430
series and he's inspired many longtime

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,589
viewers first on bloggers to pick up a

27
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,260
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk to themselves usually</font>

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,360
privately in a room for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pleasure of</font>

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,340
starting out because of Ben cooks videos

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,920
I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say welcome to the</font>

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,130
community and I'll give you about a year

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,930
before you start reminiscing about the

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,600
good times and wishing that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
was more community driven a year or so

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,520
so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> up been cookin blogging I just</font>

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,140
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention that I've been a really</font>

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,329
big fan of kpop for a good few years

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,310
before Gangnam style came along and

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,280
became the dance craze of 2012 and so

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,340
for all of you who now think it's really

42
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,009
cool to dance like a horse in the middle

43
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,790
of a club I hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for making my thing</font>

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,250
popular and ruining it for me some

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,049
people have predicted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> International</font>

46
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,869
rise of Korean pop stars in 2013 because

47
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,969
of the success of Gangnam style but

48
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,820
let's be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the Macarena in</font>

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,880
the 90s there wasn't a new wave of old

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,310
Spanish men releasing dance tracks so

51
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,098
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> Korean pop has reached its</font>

peak in 2012 in 2013 the only

the fiscal cliff so the job market isn't

104
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,400
doing very well at the moment anyway but

105
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,349
