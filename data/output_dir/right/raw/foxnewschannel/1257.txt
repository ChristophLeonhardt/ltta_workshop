1
00:00:01,636 --> 00:00:02,903
AND THEN SOME.

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:06,674
>> Neil: I WANT TO SWITCH TO A

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,942
SUBJECT THAT PEOPLE CAN RELATE

4
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:08,209
TO.

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,244
THIS IS A DOCTOR SUING A PATIENT

6
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,479
FOR A MILLION BUCKS BECAUSE SHE

7
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,081
GAVE A BAD REVIEW ON YELP.

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,750
SO I GET YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,351
WHAT YOU WRITE.

10
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,486
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:22,023
>> WHO READS REVIEWS ON YELP ANY

12
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:22,423
WAYS?

13
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:23,090
YOU DO?

14
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,026
I NEVER DO.

15
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:28,362
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE THAT LEAVE

16
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,165
REVIEWS ON YELP ARE PICKY.

17
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,800
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GREAT.

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,835
THE FOOD WAS GREAT BUT THE FREE

19
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,637
BREAD WAS STALE.

20
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,139
>> THIS IS A DOCTOR THOUGH.

21
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,940
DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY HE WAS

22
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,374
CHARACTERIZED.

23
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,208
>> YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE

24
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,443
PEOPLE WRITING IT.

25
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,411
I READ IT, TOO.

26
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,980
I'M TOO LAZY TO WRITE --

27
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,547
>> YEAH.

28
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,816
>> STUDY CAME OUT.

29
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:51,786
49 PEOPLE SAID THEY WON'T GO TO

30
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,154
A BUSINESS IF THEY PEOPLE IF

31
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,388
IT'S BELOW FOUR STARS.

32
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,691
SO THIS DOCTOR HAS A RIGHT TO

33
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,459
MAINTAIN WHAT IS BEING SAID.

34
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,860
>> Neil: HOW TO ANSWER IT --

35
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,329
>> IF IT'S NOT FACTUAL.

36
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,964
>> TO ME, IT KILLS THIS INDUSTRY

37
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:08,069
OF YELP AND TRIP ADVISER AND THE

38
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,704
OTHER HEALTH GRADES.

39
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:12,440
IT'S ONE THING, YES, IF PEOPLE

40
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,408
LEAVE NEGATIVE COMPLETELY

41
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:14,975
EGREGIOUS THINGS.

42
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,544
IF SOMEONE LEAVES SOMETHING THAT

43
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,378
IS TRUTHFUL.

44
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,180
I DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME.

45
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,149
I WENT TO SEE YOU AND THEN YOUR

46
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,317
RECOURSE IS JUST SUE ME.

47
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,151
WHAT IS THIS?

48
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,586
LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS?

49
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,187
>> YEAH.

50
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,688
A MILLION BUCKS SEEMS LIKE QUITE

51
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:28,222
A BIT.

52
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,190
>> IT'S PR.

53
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,925
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM

54
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:31,292
RIGHT NOW.

55
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,259
THIS DOCTOR.

56
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,763
HIS FACE IS IN ALL OF THESE

57
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,764
ADVERTISEMENTS.

58
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,065
HE'S GETTING FREE AIR TIME.

59
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,800
>> BUT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO

60
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,634
TO HIM.

61
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,902
>> Neil: PEOPLE ARE THINKING, I

62
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,204
HAVE TO BE CRITICAL.

63
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,406
I COULD BE SUED.

64
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,108
>> SHE'S NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO

65
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,877
SUE SOMEBODY WITH A NEGATIVE

66
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:50,211
REVIEW.

67
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,213
>> REALLY?

68
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,114
>> YEAH.

69
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,216
THERE WAS A CHIMNEY COMPANY --

70
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,518
IT'S AN EXAMPLE.

71
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,587
IT'S WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS.

72
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:00,521
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YOU

73
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,289
TRUST GOING BACK TO THIS GUY.

74
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,791
HE'S AN OB-GYN.

75
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,160
YOU GO BACK AND LIKE --

76
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,595
>> Neil: WE'RE NOT GOING THERE.

77
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:12,333
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN MAKING

78
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,567
CONTROVERSIAL PARDONS.

79
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,635
BLAGOJEVICH, MARTHA STEWART AND

80
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,603
ON AND ON.

81
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,504
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

82
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,271
TAKE NOTE?

83
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,706
>> I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

84
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,573
THESE PARDONS.

85
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,976
IF HE'S GOING TO BE PARDONING

86
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,211
PEOPLE, HE NEEDS TO PARDON

87
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:24,712
MATTHEW CHARLES.

88
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,347
HE WAS OUT FOR TWO YEARS.

89
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,582
HE HAD A STEADY JOB, STEADY

90
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,483
GIRLFRIEND.

91
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,351
VOLUNTEERS EVERY SATURDAY.

92
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,186
TURNS OUT HE WAS RELEASED IN

93
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,988
ERROR SO THEY'RE SENDING HIM

94
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,423
BACK FOR ANOTHER DECADE.

95
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:36,891
THEY SENT HIM BACK --

96
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,592
>> Neil: AND THEY HAVE

97
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,060
PETITIONED HIM TO DO THAT.

98
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,661
IT'S AWFUL.

99
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,198
IF HE'S PARDONING --

100
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,568
>> Neil: AND BLAGOJEVICH, MARCH

101
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,770
A COMMUTE --

102
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,405
>> RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE TRUMP

103
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:53,541
IS PARDONING PEOPLE ON "THE

104
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,309
APPRENTICE" OR PEOPLE SUPPORTING

105
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,145
HIM OR -- IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD

106
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:58,913
THING IF JUSTICE IS BEING SERVED

107
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:02,283
AND THE PRESIDENT IS USING THEIR

108
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,452
POWER IN A GOOD WAY.

109
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:11,859
>> 2016, 17, BEFORE OBAMA LEFT,

110
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:17,365
HE PARDONED THE FALM TERRORIST.

111
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,266
>> Neil: DO WE KNOW IF THIS

112
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,568
PRESIDENT HAS HAD MORE --

113
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,004
>> NO, AT THIS STAGE.

114
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,071
>> FEELS LIKE IT.

115
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,640
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT.

116
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,607
COULD BE TWO THINGS.

117
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,009
ONE THING THAT HE SHOWS HE HAS

118
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,211
THE ABILITY TO BE ABOVE THE LAW.

119
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,346
IF IT'S WERE MARTHA STEWART, I'M

120
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,948
GETTING A COMEBACK, DOING THINGS

121
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:34,582
WITH SNOOP DOG.

122
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,651
I DON'T WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY

123
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:40,721
THAT I LIED ON AN INSIDER

124
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,322
TRADING CASE.

125
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,924
>> WHAT'S THE POINT?

126
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,759
>> Neil: IS THAT EXPUNGED FROM

127
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,693
HER RECORD?

128
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,729
>> THE PONCHO SHE WORE SOLD

129
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,030
WELL.

130
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,198
IT WAS A KNITTED PONCHO.

131
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:53,434
>> YOU HAVE DETAILS.

132
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,269
>> IT SEEMED HYPOCRITE

133
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:55,303
>> IT SEEMED HYPOCRIIE

134
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:55,336
>> IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICA

135
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,871
>> IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL

136
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:56,904
>> IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL T

137
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:56,938
>> IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL THA

138
00:03:56,938 --> 00:00:00,000
>> IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL THAT
