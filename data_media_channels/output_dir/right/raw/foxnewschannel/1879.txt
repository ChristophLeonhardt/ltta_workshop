1
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:12,129
>> WE ARE PUTTING THE HARSHEST,

2
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:13,197
STRONGEST, MOST STRINGENT

3
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:17,367
SANCTIONS ON IRAN.

4
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:20,370
I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,805
WITH THEM, A GOOD DEAL, A FAIR

6
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:23,774
DEAL, A GOOD DEAL FOR THEM,

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,943
BETTER FOR THEM.

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:30,147
BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO HAVE

9
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:30,614
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

10
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:34,751
WE MUST BE ABLE TO GO TO A SITE

11
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,186
AND CHECK THAT SITE.

12
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:40,157
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO

13
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:40,824
THEIR MILITARY BASES TO SEE

14
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,427
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE

15
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:44,161
CHEATING.

16
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,363
>> Sean: THAT WAS THE

17
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,598
PRESIDENT EARLIER SAYING THE

18
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:48,465
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MUST

19
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,367
NEVER, EVER ALLOW IRAN TO HAVE

20
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:51,168
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

21
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:52,970
HERE WITH REACTION, THE HOST OF

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,006
THE RTV, HE'S THE HOST RIGHT

23
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,775
HERE OF THE NUMBER ONE SHOW

24
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,745
SUNDAY NIGHTS, 10:00 P.M. AND

25
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:02,179
ALL OF CABLE.

26
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,582
LIFE LIBERTY AND LEVIN.

27
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:07,384
I CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE MARK

28
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:07,818
LEVIN.

29
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,253
I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON AND TALK

30
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:09,786
ABOUT THE STORY.

31
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:10,988
I FORCED YOU TO DO RADIO.

32
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,422
LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS.

33
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:14,191
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, AND I

34
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,159
MADE YOU DO IT FOR ME.

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,494
I MADE YOU WORK FOR FREE FOR A

36
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,397
YEAR ON WEEKENDS.

37
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:21,231
THAT'S ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF

38
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,766
MY CAREER, MY FRIEND.

39
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,701
HOW ARE YOU?

40
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,870
NEVER BEEN DIFFERENT.

41
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,074
>> Sean: MARK, WHEN I READ THE

42
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:32,409
JUDGE ON FRIDAY, I THOUGHT OF

43
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:32,776
YOU.

44
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,378
YEARS AGO, HE WROTE AN

45
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:35,979
INCREDIBLE BOOK CALLED "MEN IN

46
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:36,647
BLACK."

47
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:41,285
YOU WROTE THE LIBERTY --

48
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:44,588
AMERICAN TYRANNY.

49
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:45,589
LIBERTY VERSUS TYRANNY.

50
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:46,690
>> SO MANY OF THEM.

51
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,159
STAY WHEN THEY ARE ALL GREAT

52
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,459
BOOKS.

53
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,761
YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR.

54
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,795
YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

55
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,664
YOU'VE HEARD WHETHER THE JUDGE

56
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,365
SAID FRIDAY.

57
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,767
THEY ARE PUTTING THE SCREWS TO

58
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:57,200
PAUL MANAFORT.

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,268
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

60
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:58,635
COLLUSION.

61
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:00,370
THEY WANT HIM TO SING.

62
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:00,771
BE CAREFUL.

63
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,005
HE MAY NOT JUST SAYING.

64
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:02,472
HE MAY COMPOSE.

65
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:04,474
I WAS PROUD OF THAT JUDGE

66
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,209
BECAUSE THAT JUDGE NAILED IT.

67
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,412
NOW YOU SEE SARA CARTER'S REPORT

68
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,378
TONIGHT.

69
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,413
COMEY AND MUELLER COORDINATING.

70
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:14,351
TELL ME WHY THIS IS SO BIG.

71
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:18,455
>> LET'S HOPE THE JUDGE IS NOT

72
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:19,756
JUST A GASBAG AND DOES SOMETHING

73
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:20,757
ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS.

74
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,993
LET'S DRAG US ALL BACK, FOR A

75
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,361
FEW MINUTES, TO THE

76
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:24,995
CONSTITUTION.

77
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,096
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE,

78
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:29,166
THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO WIND

79
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:29,433
UP.

80
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:30,867
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DEPUTY

81
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:31,902
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE TO ANSWER

82
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,970
SOME FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT

83
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,139
THIS INVESTIGATION.

84
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:36,940
MR. MUELLER WANTS TO INTERVIEW

85
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,175
THE PRESIDENT COMMITTEE WANTS TO

86
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,276
INTERVIEW HIM UNDER THE MOST

87
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:39,843
ONEROUS CIRCUMSTANCE.

88
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,378
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF AN

89
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,046
INTERVIEW LIKE THAT BASED ON

90
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,982
THOSE 49 GENERAL AREAS?

91
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:47,184
'S PURPOSE IS TO INDICT THE

92
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:48,585
PRESIDENT.

93
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,786
NOW, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF

94
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,388
INDICTING THE PRESIDENT, TO TRY

95
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,156
THE PRESIDENT FIND HIM GUILTY.

96
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:54,958
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE

97
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:55,359
CONVICTION?

98
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,994
TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE

99
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:57,694
UNITED STATES FROM OFFICE.

100
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:58,295
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

101
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,797
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN

102
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:02,566
INDICTED WHILE IN OFFICE.

103
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,166
NOT ONE.

104
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,201
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN

105
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:07,371
FORCED BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND

106
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:07,838
JURY, NOT ONE.

107
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,072
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN

108
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:12,776
REMOVED FROM OFFICE BY THE

109
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,443
UNITED STATES SENATE IN A

110
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,679
TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF THE SENATE.

111
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,714
NOT ONE.

112
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:19,149
MUELLER'S PURPOSE, HIS PURPOSE

113
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,550
IS TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT.

114
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,187
THAT MEANS ONE MAN, THAT MEANS

115
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:27,491
ONE MAN, ONE JURY WOULD USURP

116
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,760
THE POWER, THE ENTIRE

117
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,394
CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF

118
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,161
CONGRESS.

119
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,563
THE POWER TO REMOVE A PRESIDENT.

120
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:34,998
YOU CAN INDICT EVERY OTHER

121
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:35,799
PUBLIC OFFICIAL.

122
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,467
A JUDGE, FOR INSTANCE, WHILE

123
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,036
THEY ARE IN OFFICE, AND GO

124
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:40,637
THROUGH THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

125
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,638
YOU CANNOT DO IT WITH A

126
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,472
PRESIDENT, AND I'M GOING TO TELL

127
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,874
YOU I'VE BEEN STARTING THIS FOR

128
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:44,408
DECADES.

129
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,509
I'M STARTING IT NOW.

130
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,277
HERE'S THE AUTHORITATIVE BOOK.

131
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:50,180
SO WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?

132
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,815
TAKES TWO-THIRDS OF THE SENATE

133
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,584
TO REMOVE A PRESIDENT.

134
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,919
NOT ONE PROSECUTOR, NOT ONE

135
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,787
JURY.

136
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:59,790
SO MY QUESTION IS, FROM A

137
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,891
CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, TO

138
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:01,591
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS

139
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,960
COMMITS TIME TO STEP UP.

140
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,761
TO THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL,

141
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,363
IT'S TIME TO PAY ATTENTION.

142
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:07,531
TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, TO ALL

143
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:11,435
THE LAWYERS YOU BRING ON YOUR

144
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,236
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE NOW, THESE

145
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:15,038
FIGHTS OVER WHETHER HE'S

146
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,873
GOING TO BE SUBPOENAED, THE

147
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:17,641
PRESIDENT, WHETHER HE'S GOING TO

148
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,409
ANSWER QUESTIONS, WHETHER HE CAN

149
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:20,777
BE INDICTED IN OFFICE, I WANT

150
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,379
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

151
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,380
FRAMERS NEVER EVEN CONTEMPLATED

152
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,782
WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY.

153
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,818
THEY NEVER CONTEMPLATED THAT ONE

154
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:30,587
PROSECUTOR, A CIVIL SERVANT,

155
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,389
BUREAUCRAT APPOINTED BY SOMEBODY

156
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,624
ELSE, WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO

157
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:35,358
EFFECTIVELY REMOVE THE PRESIDENT

158
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,193
OF THE UNITED STATES.

159
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,994
THE REASON WHY THE DEMOCRATS ARE

160
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:39,396
HANGING THEIR HAT ON MUELLER,

161
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:40,797
THE REASON WHY THE MEDIA ARE

162
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,698
HANGING THEIR HAT ON MUELLER,

163
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,766
THEY WILL NEVER GET TWO-THIRDS

164
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,201
IN THE SENATE TO REMOVE THIS

165
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:44,568
PRESIDENT.

166
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,069
I DON'T CARE IF THEY IMPEACH

167
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:46,336
HIM.

168
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,004
THEY WILL NEVER GET TWO-THIRDS.

169
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,439
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

170
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,775
SO WHAT THEY ARE HOPING TO DO IS

171
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:54,377
TRAP HIM IN THIS NOTION OF A

172
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,579
SUBPOENA AND QUESTIONING, INDICT

173
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,281
HIM, TRY TO HUMILIATE HIM.

174
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:01,017
GO IN FRONT OF A COURT, HOPE

175
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,018
THEY THINK GET THE SUPREME COURT

176
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:05,856
ON THEIR SIDE BUT I DOUBT THEY

177
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,390
WILL BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

178
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,191
THAT'S OUR GAME PLAN.

179
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,193
GET HIM TO RESIGN.

180
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:11,762
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

181
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:12,996
FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL

182
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,198
PERSPECTIVE, AS I SPEAK,

183
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,366
MR. MUELLER IS UNDERMINING THE

184
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:16,800
CONSTITUTION.

185
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,602
HE'S NOT UPHOLDING THE RULE OF

186
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:19,402
LAW.

187
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,404
WHETHER HE IS CONSULTING WITH

188
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,205
COMEY OR CONSULTING WITH

189
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,273
NOSTRADAMUS, MY POINT IS THIS.

190
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:28,979
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW LEE'S

191
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:29,513
ANTI-CONSTITUTIONAL.

192
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:32,015
IT'S UNDERMINING OUR SYSTEM.

193
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,383
THE FRAMERS WANTED THE BODY

194
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,584

195
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,620

196
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,387
GOVERNMENT.

199
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:41,992
PLACE.

200
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:44,761
THE MEDIA ARE TOO IGNORANT, TOO

201
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,595
LIBERAL, TOO OBSESSED TO

202
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,997
UNDERSTAND THIS, BUT I AM HOPING

203
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:48,198

206
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:51,568
THE GREAT ONE.

207
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:54,571
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS, OUR

208
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:55,572
GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT IN MY

209
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,274

00:05:59,442 --> 00:05:59,910
TAKE CONVINCING.

212
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,913
WASN'T EASY.

213
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:04,881
MARK, YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF OUR

214
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,416
FRAMERS AND OUR FOUNDERS IN OUR

215
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,019
CONSTITUTION IS SECOND NOBODY.

217
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:10,620
