so I don't know what's in the water in West Virginia lately and that might be part of the issue here but all of a sudden we've got a lot of progressive heroes coming out of West Virginia and and they are actually like I said literally fighting for the water including poured apology and Swearengen running for Senate against Joe Manchin and we've had a lot of them on rebel headquarters but this one wow what a wonderful action and statement by Lissa Lucas she went down to talk about a law that they were trying to pass that in West Virginia and I think you'll love what she had to say yeah the law is about how you needed a hundred percent of landowners to give permission to use their land for oil and gas companies now that makes sense their land I mean that should cut across all ideologies I noticed servitors don't like easement laws when they you know you've got a mall coming through or whatever and they take your land for public use and that was a huge conservative issue now they they want to knock it down as just 75 percent have to agree why because the oil gas companies paid the politicians so we're done with that there goes your constitutional rights and whether you're conservative or progressive is he relevant to them but it's relevant to her so she went down there to set him straight listen to what she had to say and then listen to what they did to her and I have to keep it short simply because the public only gets a minute 45 while lobbyists can throw a gala at the Marriott with whiskey and wine and talk for hours to the delegates so to keep it short on the Judiciary Committee Charlotte Lane about ten thousand dollars from gas and oil interest including a EP marathon first Energy Dominion eqt and I could go on next let's talk about John shot from Mercer first energy $2,000 Appalachian Power $2,000 step two in Johnson that's a gas and oil law firm $2,000 console energy 1,000 eqt 1000 and I could go on now let's talk about Jason Hershberger mr. Lucas we asked no person comments be made if you talk about I still comment is a personal comment and I'm gonna call you out of order if you're talking about individuals on the committee so if you would just address the bill that's not you know I ask you to please step down earth took thirty five hundred dollars about removed forty person uh-huh God man she's an American Hero I want if you can man every one of you go do likewise so that happened to be the West Virginia House of Delegates that was on Friday all she did was she just read the donations from the fossil fuel companies you're passing a law to the benefit of fossil fuel companies and that is gonna take away constitutional rights of American citizens so I'm just gonna read the donations you got from fossil fuel companies that's all I'm not saying it's a good thing I'm not saying it's a bad thing I'm just reading the donations apparently the politicians took such great offense at that they had a cutter Mike and remove her from the building and to shove her out of the way why are you taking your fence I thought it was just those fossil fuel companies who are people because corporations are people my friend that's what Mitt Romney tells me that's what the corrupt politicians tell me that they're just and they were just speaking to you that money is speech and those are people so why are you embarrassed you were just having a conversation with those oil companies why are you so embarrassed because you know that it's in fact corruption and what those are are bribes they're legalized bribes that's the swamp so when all she does is read the money that you have taken you want her to leave the building that's her house that's not your house that's her house she's a citizen of West Virginia doing what every citizen should you get involved call him out on it so I want a quarter or more afterwards she said as I try to give my remarks at the public hearing this morning on HP for 268 in defense of our constitutional property rights I got dragged out of House chambers not and allowed me to point out that if delegates genuinely think that my talking about who their campaign donors are and how much they're receiving from corporate lobbyists slash corporate PACs is an ad hominem attack then they should be refusing those donations if you don't like your bribes being called out then don't take them that makes all the sense in the world otherwise why why aren't you proud should be of course I had a great conversation with an oil company at the end of that conversation they gave me five thousand dollars and I and I use it to get elected over and over again and to maintain my own power privilege and money go ahead and be proud if you're not proud then maybe you might want to fix the system she went on to say refused any donation that if someone meshes it makes you feel personally attacked because that's not an attack that's guilt and you should be feeling that let that guilt about who you're really working for inform your votes don't let the corporate corporate money do it so she's going to be on rebel headquarters tonight we have wonderful producers here at the Young Turks she was gonna be on before I even knew this story happened and she's gonna come and tell her side of it you know the Young Turks is live 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern rebel headquarters where we have progressives come

more quotes to you guys from her be as to why she's hurting cuz she's an average citizen she's not born politicians not lobbyists not any of that okay she says I'm a regular person just a regular person who got so disgusted with money in politics that despite being an introvert I'm running for office yes look there's so many people working on these issues from so many different angles and they fight so hard to regular people stay in there okay stay in the fight and I've seen other people say look I never wanted to do it I have issues stuttering I have issues being an introvert I don't like to go out into crowds etc but they do it they brave that to be able to speak their mind that there's nothing better as an American citizen than doing that speak out you're supposed to that's the heart of the country she said I'm a Democrat but I know this district is being politically sacrificed by Democratic leadership in order to get energy sector money in their up ticket races I've called I've written a begged in person running for office is the only other thing I can think of to fight back she said there must be regular folks to represent us people who aren't interested in making politics a life long career I want to get the money out of politics that'll make a huge difference politicians will have will then have to listen to the vote their voters they're real constituents then hopefully I can get back to the farm and go about fixing my camper and hiking with my dog you know what that reminds me of it reminds me of the founding fathers that's what they used to say all the time we just want to fix this thing and then get back to our farms true today in West Virginia as it was back then and unfortunately the fight for democracy is true and important and relevant today as it was back then because we have lost our democracy now we have legalized bribery you're just allowed to give campaign contributions you allowed to do independent expenditures you're about allowed to do dark money and you're allowed to do it at unlimited amounts of course they work for their donors 93% of Americans say they're that politicians work for their donors and not their voters we are not blind deaf and dumb we can see it as clear as day you can shut all the mics you like and it isn't gonna fix the problem and it isn't going to cover up what you're doing there's only one answer get money out of politics and if you do and you have real democracy then the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership can't continue to work for the corporations and not for us and by the way also for the unions I don't want any money in politics I don't care where it comes from and the private financing so that they don't work for private interests lissa Lucas is an American Hero I love what she did learn from her go do it wherever you live and make sure you hold your politicians accountable fight back get money out of politics if you want to get the whole young turks show every
