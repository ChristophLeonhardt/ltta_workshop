This whole two-week effort
has been a calculated and
orchestrated political hit,
fueled with apparent pent-up
anger about President Trump
and the 2016 election,
fear that has been
unfairly stoked
about my judicial record,
revenge on behalf
of the Clintons,
and millions of dollars
in money from outside,
left-wing opposition groups.
This is a circus.
The consequences will extend
long past my nomination.
The consequences will
be with us for decades.
This grotesque and coordinated
character assassination
will dissuade confident
and good people
of all political persuasions
from serving our country.
And as we all know,
in the United States
political system
of the early 2000s,
what goes around
comes around.
I am an optimistic guy.
I always try to be on the
sunrise side of the mountain,
to be optimistic about
the day that is coming.
But today I have to say
that I fear for the future.
Last time I was here,
I told this committee
that a federal judge
must be independent,
not swayed by public
or political pressure.
I said I was such a judge.
And I am.
I will not be intimidated into
withdrawing from this process.
You’ve tried hard.
You’ve given it your all.
No one can question
your effort.
But your coordinated
and well-funded effort
to destroy my good name
and destroy my family
will not drive me out.
The vile threats of violence
against my family
will not drive me out.
You may defeat me
in the final vote,
but you’ll never
get me to quit.
Never.
I’m here today
to tell the truth.
I’ve never sexually
assaulted anyone,
not in high school,
not in college, not ever.
Sexual assault is horrific.
One of my closest
friends to this day
is a woman who was
sexually abused
and who in the 1990s,
when we were in our 30s,
confided in me about the abuse
and sought my advice.
I was one of the only
people she consulted.
Allegations of sexual assault
must always
be taken seriously — always.
Those who make allegations
always deserve to be heard.
At the same time,
the person who
is the subject of
the allegations
also deserves to be heard.
Due process is a foundation
of the American rule of law.
Due process means
listening to both sides.
I’m not questioning
that Dr. Ford may
have been sexually
assaulted by some person
in some place
at some time.
But I have never done this —
to her or to anyone.
That’s not who I am.
It is not who I was.
I am innocent of this charge.
I intend no ill will to
Dr. Ford and her family.
The other night Ashley
and my daughter Liza
said their prayers
and little Liza,
all of 10 years old,
said to Ashley, “We should
pray for the woman.”
It’s a lot of wisdom
from a 10-year-old.
We mean —
we mean no ill will.
