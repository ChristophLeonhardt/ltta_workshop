after Washington announced an ends to family separation of asylum seekers at the border there was no celebrating in Brownsville Texas instead only confusion the law states families seeking asylum that are arrested in the US can only be kept together in detention for 20 days Trump's legal team says they'll go to court to try to extend that and the so-called zero tolerance policy it remains in place so there is no change in policy on arresting asylum seekers and charging them with the crime the thing that concerns us the most is that ultimately what this will result in as far as we can tell is indefinite detainment of families sounds like you don't think this is the solution absolutely not a lot of confusion still in the days ahead yeah there's a lot of opacity still around this and ultimately until we see an end to zero tolerance we don't think that this is a we don't think that you can address these issues without ending zero tolerance with not enough shelters or detention facilities to house everyone tent city detention centers for children like this one in a remote desert area near El Paso Texas will remain for now conditions are difficult temperatures can reach 42 degrees Celsius and in Brownsville outside this shelter Detention Center housing hundreds of kids no sign of being reunited with their parents this shelter behind me is one that already has children in it that have been separated from their families the big question now is how to get them reunited problem is there does not seem to be any system in place to make that happen so it could be days weeks or even months until families are finally reunited activists here remain baffled by what's going on saying the hellish situation is just giving way to another it's a it's a crime in my mind is a crime quite simply it's a separation of a innocent baby from the mother and it's completely out of proportion to what's going on in Washington relief perhaps after Trump's move to curtail the growing storm clouds separation policy is brought over as presidency but here just another night of kids going to bed without knowing what's happened to their parents Gabriel azan dough al-jazeera Brownsville Texas
