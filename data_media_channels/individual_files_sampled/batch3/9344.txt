♪ ♪ Juan: A NEW JERSEY HIGH SCHOOL UPSETTING STUDENTS AND SOME PARENTS AFTER IMPLEMENTING A NEW POLICY TO MAKE THE CHEERLEADING TEAM MORE INCLUSIVE. THE SCHOOL SAYING THE SQUAD MUST NOW ACCEPT EVERYONE OR BE DISBANDED. THIS DECISION COMING UP TO ONE PARENT COMPLAINED WHEN HER CHILD DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT FOLLOWING TRYOUTS LAST MONTH. GREG, IS THIS A CASE OF, YOU KNOW, Kimberly: HE WAS A CHEERLEADER. Greg: I WAS. Juan: IS THAT RIGHT? I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU ARE HAVING FUN AT HIS EXPENSE. Greg: A SECRET I WAS TRYING TO KEEP FROM AMERICA. Juan: DO YOU THINK IT'S WEAKENING OUR CHILDREN? Greg: I DON'T KNOW. HERE IS MY FEELING. IT'S A SMALL LOCAL STORY OVER A BEEF OVER A CHEERLEADING CHOICE. SOME PARENTS CUT TICKED OFF. NOW IT'S A NATIONAL STORY. I'M A LITTLE SCARED. NONE OF THE TEACHERS OR COACHES MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO BE FORCED TO DEAL WITH THE TRANSIENT SPOTLIGHT SEEKING THE LATEST RAW MEAT. I FEEL AMBIVALENT. I KNOW I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO. THIS IS A TERRIBLE STORY! I AM OUTRAGED! POLITICAL CORRECTNESS RUN A MOCK. Jesse: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED. Kimberly: SOMETIMES... PERCOLATING BELOW THE SURFACE. Juan: FIVE HOPEFULS WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SCORE 87 OR HIGHER, BUT THEY DID SCORE 78 TO 86. THE SCHOOL SAID YOU CAN FOR DISSIPATE. Dana: OKAY. I AM NOT OUTRAGED. IT TAKES A LOT TO GET ME OUTRAGED. BUT I WILL SAY THEY'RE NOT DOING THEM ANY FAVORS FOR WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO ENTER THE JOB MARKETS. IT'S A SUPER COMPETITIVE WORLD RIGHT NOW TO GET A JOB. GUESS WHAT. 20 PEOPLE DON'T GET THE JOB. ONE PERSON WILL GET THE JOB. Greg: GOOD POINT. AS A FORMER CHEERLEADER, YES. I AGREE. Juan: JESSE, WHAT ABOUT POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT, LIKE SAYING TO YOUNG PEOPLE, YEAH, WE ARE GOING TO REWARD YOU FOR YOUR EFFORT. Jesse: IF EVERYBODY MAKES THE TEAM, THEN YOU DON'T TRY HARD TO MAKE THE TEAM. Juan: NO, I WAS SAYING EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING BUT DON'T MAKE THE CUT ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATING. Jesse: TOO BAD. THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE THE TEAM. YOU MAKE IT OR YOU DON'T MAKE IT. I HATE THIS STORY. I THINK IT'S TOTALLY LAME. WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP, THERE WERE CUTS. YOU FOUND OUT. YOU WOULD LOOK ON THE SHEET. YOU DIDN'T PLAY. SORRY, MAYBE NEXT YEAR. Dana: THAT ARE DETECTED. THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK UP AND LOOK. Jesse: PEOPLE LOOK AND THEN SCURRY AWAY. Kimberly: DID YOU EVER NOT MAKE SOMETHING? Jesse: I GOT CUT IN EIGHTH GRADE BASKETBALL. BUT I WEASELED MY WAY ONTO THE TEAM. Juan: MICHAEL JORDAN GOT CUT. MICHAEL JORDAN DIDN'T QUIT. THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING, KIMBERLY. Kimberly: THAT GREG IS A CHEERLEADER AND NOT ME. Juan: I THINK YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IF YOU WANTED TO. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DANCE AND ART FOR CHEERLEADING AND ACROBATIC CHEERLEADERS. Jesse: JUAN IS IN THE WEEDS. Juan: WHO GETS POINTS AND WHO DOESN'T. DOESN'T MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. Kimberly: WHAT HAPPENS IS, SOMETIMES YOU CAN HAVE, WE USED TO HAVE AT MY SCHOOL. WE HAD SONG GIRLS AND WE HAD CHEERLEADERS. THE CHEERLEADERS WOULD DO MORE ACROBATICS, TUMBLING. SONG GIRLS DID THE DANCE ROUTINE. IT WAS KIND OF SEPARATE. YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE IN VERY GOOD PHYSICAL SHAPE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. PYRAMIDS AND STUFF AND YOU CAN FALL. THEY DO FLIPS. IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING. YOU'VE GOT TO BE IN SHAPE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. Jesse: ISN'T CHEERLEADING SEXIST? THIS IS THE WHOLE THING. WHAT ARE LIBERALS DOING? COERCING YOUNG GIRLS. Juan: HOW DO YOU KNOW THE PRINCIPLE IS A LIBERAL? Jesse: OH, COME ON. Kimberly: I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT WITH THIS. WHEN I WAS IN SECOND GRADE, THERE WAS NO GIRLS TEAM FOR SOCCER. MY MOM CONVINCED THE COACH TO GIVE ME A TRYOUT AND SAID IF SHE IS GOOD ENOUGH AND SHE IS AS GOOD AS ANY OF THE GUYS PLAYING, THEN PUT HER ON THE TEAM. IF SHE'S NOT, CUT HER. I MADE THE TEAM. I LIKED IT. IT TAUGHT ME TO RELINE HER SOFT, PRACTICE, WORK HARD AND DO IT. EVENTUALLY THEY HAD A GIRLS TEAM. Greg: DO YOU REMEMBER ON THE BRADY BUNCH WHEN PETER BRADY BECAME A SUNFLOWER, GIRL SCOUTS. THEN MARCIA BRADY JOINED THE GIRL SCOUTS. THAT WAS IN THE EARLY '70s. Jesse: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
