MATT.
>> THIS IS THE CLOSS HOUSE
WHERE POLICE SAY JAMES AND
DENISE CLOSS WERE SHOT TO DEATH.
THEIR 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
LIKELY THERE TO WITNESS HER
PARENTS' MURDER AND SHE HAS
VANISHED.
THE FRONT DOOR WAS EITHER
KICKED OR SHOT IN.
NOW THE FRONT DOOR IS MISSING
REPLACED BY PIECES OF PLYWOOD.
THIS MORNING WE WOULD LIKE TO
SHOW YOU NEW PICTURES OBTAINED
BY FOX NEWS OF THIS COUPLE THAT
WAS MURDERED ACCORDING TO
POLICE.
SO FAR NO PIECE OF INFORMATION
TO SUGGEST ANYONE WOULD WANT TO
KILL THEM.
YESTERDAY LAW ENFORCEMENT
ORGANIZED 100 VOLUNTEERS TO
SEARCH A 14-MILE STRETCH OF THE
DITCH LINE ON THE HIGHWAY WHERE
THIS HOUSE SITS.
VOLUNTEERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO
LOOK FOR ANYTHING, EVEN A GUN.
THE SHERIFF HAS SINCE POSTED
UNFORTUNATELY THAT SEARCH DID
NOT YIELD ANYTHING OF
EVIDENTIARY VALUE.
LAW ENFORCEMENT TELLS US
NEIGHBORS ARE PLEADING TO
ASSIST IN THE SEARCH AND WE GOT
TO TALK TO SOME OF THOSE
VOLUNTEERS.
>> MY DAD GRABBED ME AND SAID
WE'RE DOING A SEARCH FOR JAYME
AND I SAID ABSOLUTELY, LET'S GO.
>> THE MURDERS ARE BOTHERING
EVERYBODY.
AS FOR JAYME, WE'RE HOPING THAT
SHE IS STILL IN THE AREA AND
ALIVE.
>> THE BARRON COUNTY SHERIFF
HAS MORE THAN 400 TIPS HAVE
COME IN BUT NO SUSPECTS SO FAR
IN THE MYSTERY.
THE SHERIFF IS ASKING PEOPLE TO
SEARCH THEIR CABINS OR PROPERTY
FOR ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.
BUSINESS OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS
SAY INVESTIGATORS HAVE SHOWED
UP TO THEIR DOOR ASKING FOR ANY
SURVEILLANCE.
