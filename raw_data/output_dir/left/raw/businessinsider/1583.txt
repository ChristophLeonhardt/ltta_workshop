00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> books and</font>

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,480
the question of government

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,370
investigations of UFOs

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,260
it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out what what the</font>

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,570
truth really is that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there there</font>

6
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">are these cases in which documents</font>

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,600
declassified they ought to be released

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,550
the American people quite frankly can

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,420
handle the truth

12
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:14,680
I would like us to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into those files</font>

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,080
and hopefully make as much of that

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:25,840
public as possible if there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">there let's tell people there's nothing</font>

16
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,110
there there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something there well if</font>

17
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,970
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something there unless it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

18
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,190
you know threat to national security I

19
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,260
think we ought to share it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

public what is the truth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> art but it</font>

21
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,350
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> their eminence of alien life you know</font>

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,510
that's that's for the public to judge

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,670
once they've seen all the wall all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
