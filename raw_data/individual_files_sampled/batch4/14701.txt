Rex Tillerson is out at state Vladimir Putin won just how insane can the fake news industrial complex get well it seemed as if there are no limits we've just heard that a cabinet member has been fired the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson allegedly because just a day prior he had made a negative comment about Vladimir Putin and the alleged assassination plot that was recently carried out in the UK and that's why he had to go and will now be replaced by the director of Central Intelligence Mike Pompeo is that true no it's garbage it's utterly and completely false let me give you two good reasons number one back in December of last year a cabinet member informed me that Rex Tillerson was to be replaced by the director of the CIA that was three months ago this decision has been in the works for a long long time and has nothing to do with anything Rex Tillerson may have said last week about Vladimir Putin more importantly Vladimir Putin has no influence covert or otherwise in a positive fashion on this administration in the United States of America how do we know that well we can talk about information operations on Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere pathetic ones by anybody's measure but at the end of the day look at what President Trump has actually done with regards to Russia whether it's getting NATO to finally after decades commit each member nation state that is to finally key to their agreement that each country should spend at least 2% of its gross domestic product on its own defense meaning paid fair share or to the decision by this administration to unlock the Anwar lands for oil exploration to promote fracking to reopen the XL pipeline for oil and not only all of those measures which truly hurt Russia which is a one-horse town that relies almost exclusively on gas and oil exports to fund its regime perhaps the most obvious measure of all was Donald Trump's decision to arm to give armed assistance to provide weapons to the Ukrainian government in direct response to the continued threat Russia poses to the Ukraine after its invasion and annexation of Crimea all of these measures are a true reset they're not the fake plastic button that Hillary Clinton was sent to give to her counterpart in the Kremlin Russia is a threat not a strategic one like China but it is a threat and this administration understands that Rex Tillerson was a grave disappointment at the State Department unable to change its multilateral America last philosophy and an individual who isolated the president's appointees the political appointees at Foggy Bottom from his front office on the other hand DCI Pompeo is done very quietly has done some amazing things by reforming the CIA and he is going to do the same at Foggy Bottom so once again fake news has got it wrong here at the rebel we'll give you the facts stay tuned thank you for watching the Gawker briefing if you like this video please check out the rebel media YouTube channel follow me on Twitter at said Gawker that's Seb ji o RK a and share these videos on Facebook and Twitter because with your help we can push back on the fake news industrial complex and finally get the truth out god bless
