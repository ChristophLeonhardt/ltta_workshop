OVER SURVEILLANCE ON AMERICANS.

4
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,705
THE INFORMATION HAS ALSO HAD

5
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:26,774
MASSIVE IMPLICATIONS IN EUROPE.

6
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,877
CORRESPONDENT GILLIAN TURNER HAS

7
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:30,911
OUR STORY TONIGHT FROM

8
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:31,345
GREAT BRITAIN.

9
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:34,481
>> AT ONE TIME AND AS A

10
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,616
CONTRACTOR AND CIA EMPLOYEE

11
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:36,750
EDWARD SNOWDEN IS BELIEVED TO BE

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,254
IN HONG KONG TONIGHT HIDING OUT

13
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:41,088
AFTER LEAKING INFORMATION.

14
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:43,090
>> IT SHOOK THE WORLD DURING THE

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,392
SUMMER OF 2013 AND EVER SINCE,

16
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,927
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AND

17
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,063
CONGRESS HAVE BEEN EMBROILED IN

18
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:52,700
AN EPIC BATTLE OF MASS

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,501
SURVEILLANCE.

20
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:54,368
HE PUBLICLY CONFESSED TO

21
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:55,803
STEALING A TROVE OF HIGHLY

22
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:56,537
CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE ABOUT

23
00:00:56,537 --> 00:01:00,508
U.S. SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS.

24
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,243
SNOWDEN HANDED THAT INFORMATION

25
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:03,878
OVER WHOLESALE AND IN THE

26
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,913
PROCESS, REVEALED THAT THE INTEL

27
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:06,947
COMMUNITY WAS COLLECTING

28
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:08,015
INFORMATION ABOUT AMERICANS

29
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:10,084
SUSPECTED OF HAVING TIES TO

30
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,685
TERRORISM.

31
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,787
THAT PROMPTED A NATIONAL OUTCRY.

32
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:15,222
>> WHAT SNOWDEN DID MORE THAN

33
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:17,658
ANYTHING ELSE AS HE BROUGHT ONE

34
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:20,461
WORD TO THE FOREFRONT, PRIVACY.

35
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,795
HE BURST PEOPLE'S BUBBLES.

36
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,397
>> A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE

37
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:25,499
ENSUING YEARS SINCE VERY PUBLIC

38
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:25,833
FALLOUT.

39
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,301
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INSIST THEY

40
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,302
ABUSE THEIR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY

41
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:31,305
TO TAMP DOWN ON NSA OPERATIONS.

42
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:33,107
>> THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF

43
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:36,076
REFORMS, MOST OF WHICH I CAN'T

44
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:38,078
GO INTO BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,080
THAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH SNOWDEN

46
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,081
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

47
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,317
>> I WOULD FOLLOW THE LAW, AND I

48
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:45,519
WOULD INSURE IF CONFIRMED THAT

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,789
THE AGENCY FOLLOWS THE LAW.

50
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,290
>> CONGRESS AND THE DEFENSE

51
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,491
DEPARTMENT ALSO ESTABLISHED THE

52
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,293
U.S. CYBER COMMAND TO PROVIDE

53
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:53,761
MILITARY SUPPORT FOR U.S.

54
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,797
NETWORKS AND WHILE INTEL EXPERTS

55
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:57,698
WIDELY VIEW THESE STEPS AS

56
00:01:57,698 --> 00:02:00,501
EFFECTIVE, THEY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE

57
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:01,702
THE NSA CONTINUES DATA

58
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:04,505
COLLECTION OF AMERICANS.

59
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:05,506
ABOUT 530 MILLION CALLS IN JUST

60
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:06,107
A FEW EUROS.

61
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:07,542
>> THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE

62
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:08,810
COLLECTING MORE AND MORE BUT THE

63
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,745
REAL QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH OF

64
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,146
THIS ARE WE REALLY PROCESSING?

65
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,882
HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE DECISIONS

66
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:15,149
ON?

67
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,751
>> EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE ALSO

68
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,386
HIT HARD BY THE SNOWDEN

69
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:18,786
REVELATION.

70
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:19,754
BRITAIN'S GOVERNMENT IN

71
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,189
PARTICULAR IS STILL GRAPPLING TO

72
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,558
THE STATE WITH MAJOR FALLOUT AS

73
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,626
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED

74
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,128
ACCESS TO AMERICA'S DATA,

75
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:30,064
BRITAIN'S PARLIAMENT WENT IN THE

76
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:30,898
OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

77
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:31,632
IT PASSED LEGISLATION KNOWN AS

78
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:35,269
THE SNOOPERS CHARTER IN 2016

79
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:36,003
THAT REQUIRES INTERNET SERVICE

80
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:39,307
PROVIDERS TO KEEP BROWSING DATA

81
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:41,008
FOR A YEAR DOWN LIKE A YEAR.

82
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,010
IT'S BEEN FOUGHT OVER IN THE

83
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,679
HIGH COURT VIRTUALLY SINCE THE

84
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,114
DAY HAD PASSED AND JUST LAST

85
00:02:46,114 --> 00:00:00,000
MONTH THE COURT RULED IT
