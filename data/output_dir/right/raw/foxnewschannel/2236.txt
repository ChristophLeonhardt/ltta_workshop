1
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:09,129
>> IF YOU DO PULL OUT OF THAT

2
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:10,998
DEAL DO YOU WORRY IT SENDS THE

3
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:12,866
WRONG MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA AS

4
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:15,436
YOU SEEK TO ENTER NUCLEAR TALKS

5
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:15,936
WITH KIM JONG-UN?

6
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:19,173
>> President Trump: I THINK IT

7
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,241
SENDS THE MIGHT MESSAGE.

8
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,310
IN SEVEN YEARS THE DEAL EXPIRES

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,579
AND IRAN CAN CREATE NUCLEAR

10
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,847
WEAPONS.

11
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:27,514
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

12
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:29,183
SEVEN YEARS IS TOMORROW.

13
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:30,317
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

14
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:32,453
>> Bill: HE IS SAYING THE

15
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:33,621
DECISION ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR

16
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:35,923
DEAL WILL SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE

17
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:39,426
TO NORTH KOREA BEFORE THE

18
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:40,027
SUMMIT HAPPENS.

19
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:40,961
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING

20
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:42,696
EVIDENCE ABOUT IRAN LYING ITS

21
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:43,631
WAY THROUGH THE NEGOTIATIONS

22
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:45,833
THE DEAL WAS BASED ON AND STILL

23
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,103
CONCEALING THEIR NUCLEAR

24
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:49,503
ACTIVITIES.

25
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:53,107
FORMER COUNTER TERRORISM

26
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:54,174
ADVISOR AND MICHAEL WALTZ NOW

27
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:55,509
RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN FLORIDA.

28
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,877
WELCOME TO "AMERICA'S NEWSROOM."

29
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,512
IF IT'S SUCH A BAD DEAL WHY DID

30
00:00:58,512 --> 00:00:59,213
OBAMA CUT IT?

31
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:01,782
>> YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO WHEN

32
00:01:01,782 --> 00:01:03,951
SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY

33
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:05,352
ANNOUNCED THE DEAL AND BURIED

34
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:09,089
IN THAT ANNOUNCEMENT HE SAID

35
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:17,297
THAT THEY ASSESS THE IRANIANS

36
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,633
-- THEY THREW AWAY OUR

37
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,703
LEVERAGE, WHICH WAS A VERY

38
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,404
TIGHT COMPREHENSIVE SANCTIONS

39
00:01:23,404 --> 00:01:26,306
REGIME THAT WAS WORKING.

40
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,409
AND NOW THE IRANIANS ARE TAKING

41
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,679
THAT CASH AND BUYING RUSSIAN

42
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:34,314
WEAPONS TO REINFORCE THEIR AIR

43
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:34,682
DEFENSES.

44
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:36,417
IF THEY DO RENEGE AND IT

45
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,285
DOESN'T WORK OUT AMERICAN AND

46
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:40,354
ISRAELI PILOTS IF WE EVER GO TO

47
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:42,690
A MILITARY OPTION WILL HAVE A

48
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,091
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PATH TAKEN.

49
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,260
>> Bill: WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF

50
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,628
PRESIDENT TRUMP PULLS OUT?

51
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:48,929
>> I WANT TO GO TO THIS POINT

52
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,464
THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE MAKING

53
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,965
ABOUT THE SIGNAL THAT IT SENDS

54
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,500
TO THE NORTH KOREANS.

55
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,035
AND A LOT OF CRITICS ARE SAYING

56
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:56,670
IF WE BACK OUT OF THE DEAL

57
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,338
AMERICA CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

58
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,541
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THE EXACT

59
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:00,908
OPPOSITE.

60
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:03,143
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WE'RE NOT

61
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:06,213
GOING TO SIT BACK AND LET OUR

62
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,614
ADVERSARIES CHEAT ON THESE

63
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:07,915
DEALS.

64
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:09,449
WE AREN'T GOING TO ENTER INTO

65
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,883
AN AGREEMENT IN NORTH KOREA

66
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:13,220
WHERE YOU CAN ONLY FREEZE YOUR

67
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,921
PROGRAM.

68
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:17,925
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY COMPLETELY

69
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:20,127
DENUCLEARIZE LIKE LIBYA DID AND

70
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:22,229
IT HAS TO BE VERIFIABLE AND IT

71
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,166
WON'T ONLY BE TEMPORARY BUT

72
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:26,533
PERMANENT.

73
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,568
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THE

74
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:29,670
PRESIDENT IS SENDING AND WILL

75
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,539
WALK AWAY IF THERE ARE ANY

76
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,141
SHENANIGANS COMING FROM THE

77
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,075
NORTH KOREANS.

78
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:37,377
>> Bill: THE DOCUMENTS SHOW

79
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:38,779
IRAN HAD A SECRET NUCLEAR

80
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:43,984
WEAPONS PROGRAM FOR YEARS, HE

81
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:45,886
WRITES.

82
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,988
THEY HID A VAST ATOMIC ARCHIVE

83
00:02:47,988 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM THE WORLD UNTIL TODAY.
