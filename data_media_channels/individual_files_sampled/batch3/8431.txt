TWO YOUNG CONSERVATIVES PENNED AN OP ED IN THE WEEK LID STANDARD HIGHLIGHTING THE GAP BETWEEN OLD AND YOUNG CONSERVATIVES. ACCORDING TO A PUGH RESEARCH STUDY, MILLENNIALS CONSIDERED VIEWS, AND THEN THE NUMBER BALLOONED WITH 15% MILLENNIALS CALLING THEMSELVES CONSERVATIVE. WHAT SHOULD THE CONSERVATIVES NEED TO DO TO APPEAL TO MILLENNIALS. LET'S ASK OUR MILLENNIAL PANEL. CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL NOELLES, CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'OELLES, CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLLES, CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLEES, CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLES,, CHARLIE KIRK, MICHAEL 'NOLES, A PODCASTER AND ALI. GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF YOU. GOOD MORNING. LET'S START WITH YOU, CHARLIE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT SNIT. FIRST, I'LL TAKE A LITTLE EXCEPTION WITH THE ANALYSIS. I THINK IT'S MORE TRAGIC ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE THAN ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. YOU'VE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, FAVORABILITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE TOWARD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ABSOLUTELY GO DOWN TREMENDOUSLY. BARACK OBAMA GOT 66% OF THE YOUTH VOTE IN 2008 AND 20% IN 2012. HILLARY CLINTON WAS AROUND 51%, 52%. THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS. THE CORE ISSUE IS THE TERM CONSERVATIVE. YOUNG PEOPLE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM, FREE MARKETS, SMALLER GOVERNMENT. WHEN PROPERLY ARGUED TO THEM. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE LEFT IS SO GOOD AT STIGMATIZING THIS TERM CONSERVATIVE. A WORD WE KNEAD A WORD WE NNEAD A WORD WE NEEAD A WORD WE NEEDD A WORD WE NEED TO RECLAIM. SHOULD CONSERVATIVES BE FOCUSED ON FREEDOM, LIBERTY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THE YOUNG CONSERVATIVES ON GAY MARRIAGE, MARIJUANA USE ARE MORE ABOUT FREEDOM AND LIBERTY? ABSOLUTELY. WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO REALLY IS THAT MILLENNIALS CARE MORE ABOUT THE WHY THAN THE WHAT. RATHER THAN TALKING ABOUT THE WHAT OF POLICIES OR POLITICS OF CONSERVATISM, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHY THE CONSERVATIVE POLICIES ARE ACTUALLY BETTER WITH NOT JUST FOR THE RICH WHITE MALE BUT FOR EVERYONE. WHY CONSERVATIVE POLICIES, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY CAPITALISM, DEREGULATION ACTUALLY HELPS THE PEOPLE THAT MILLENNIALS CARE ABOUT, THOSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SOCIETY, THE IMMIGRANTS, THOSE IN POVERTY, WOMEN, MINORITIES, THE LGBT COMMUNITY. CHARLIE IS RIGHT. WE CARE ABOUT FREEDOM, WE CARE ABOUT VIDDISM AND ABOUT IIDDISM AND ABOUT INDDISM AND ABOUT INDIVSM AND ABOUT INDIVID AND ABOUT INDIVIDUAND ABOUT INDIVIDUALISM AND THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T SEE SKIN COLOR OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. ARE OLDER CONSERVATIVES REALLY REACHING OUT TO SAY THE LGBT COMMUNITY AS YOU SUGGEST THEY SHOULD? IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE. WELL, I DON'T WANT US TO GET INTO IDENTITY POLITICS. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT. I'M NOT BUT YOU JUST MENTIONED IT. BUT CONVEYING A MESSAGE THAT APPEALS TO PEOPLE OF ALL SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS AND BACKGROUND. IT'S NOT JUST THE BABY BOOMER'S JOB BUT IT'S THE MILLENNIALS JOB, THE WORK OF EVERYONE ON THIS PANEL THAT WE DO EVERY DAY, GOING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, HAVING THE POD COST, THE SHOWS THAT WE PUT OUT, IT'S OUR JOB AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK WE'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB. MICHAEL, CHARLIE SEEMED TO THINK THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE DEMOCRATS. DO YOU AGREE? I AGREE ENTIRELY. THIS IS A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENCY THUS FAR. WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP DID BETTER AMONG MILLENNIALS THAN EITHER JOHN McCAIN OR MITT ROMNEY. BETTER THAN ROMNEY AMONG HISPANICS AND THAT POPULATION HAS INCREASED TWO AR THREEN TIMES IN THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. IT'S OVERWHELMINGLY YOUNG AND MILLENNIAL. NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT TRUMP DID FAIRLY WELL. IN 1984 RONALD REAGAN'S SUPPORT AMONG YOUNG VOTERS SURGED BY NEARLY 40%. HIS PRESIDENCY WAS SUCCESSFUL. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, EXCELLENT DIPLOMACY IN NORTH KOREA, GOOD ECONOMY, RETURNED HOSTAGES, THE KANYE AWAIKENNING AWAKKENNING AWAKENNNING AWAKENINING AWAKENINGNG AWAKENING IN PUBLIC. THE ONLY POLL THAT'S GOING TO MATTER IS NOVEMBER 2020. CHARLIE BEN SHAPIRO WROTE CAUGHT MY EYE, THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE YOUNG CONSERVATIVES TEND TOWARD LIBERTARIANISM ON DRUGS AND SEX BUT SHARE THE SAME PRIORITIES ON OLDER INDIVIDUALS ON FISCAL. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE ALLUDED TO THAT. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP IS GETTING RESULTS ON THE ECONOMY AND MA THE MAKER THE MATER THE MATTERS TO PEOPLE. HIS VIEW HAS BEEN ON THE FOREIGN POLICY ECONOMIC MATTERS AND A DE-EMPHASIS ON THE CONTROVERSIAL DIVISIVE SOCIAL ISSUES. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO WELL WITH ALL VOTERS BUT ESPECIALLY YOUNG VOTERS HEADING INTO 2020. WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUNG PEOPLE AND SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS, A YOUNG PERSON VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS IS LIKE A CHICKEN VOTING FOR COLONEL SANDERS. THEY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN. IT'S OUR GENERATION THAT'S GOING TO BE HURT THE MOST BY DEMOCRATIC POLICIES AND POLITICIANS. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DISENGAGING FROM THE RIGHT VERSUS LEFT LABELS. DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN. BUT AGAIN, DEMOCRATS NEED YOUNGER VOTERS. IT'S ONE OF THE THREE GROUPS THAT THEY PRIMARILY NEED TO GET BASE TURNOUT FOR SO THAT EVERY OUNCE OF SUPPORT THEY LOSE HURTS THEM A LOT MORE THAN REPUBLICANS THE LAST POINT HERE, WILL OLDER CONSERVATIVES SAY HANG ON, IF YOU'RE FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY AND NOT ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, ARE YOU PULLING BACK FROM TRADITIONAL VALUES THAT MIGHT UPSET OLDER CONSERVATIVES ? -L. WE'RE WINNING THE CULTURAL WAR. I THINK SOME CONSERVATIVES ARE MISSING IT BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED US TO START LISTENING TO BARACKB US TO START LISTENING TO BARACKR US TO START LISTENING TO BARACKC US TO START LISTENING TO BARACKK US TO START LISTENING TO BARACKB US TO START LISTENING TO BARACKA US TO START LISTENING TO BARACKM US TO START LISTENING TO BARACK. WHAT WINNING IS CHANCE THE RAPPER TWEETING OUT SAYING BLACK PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS AND KANYE WEST SAYING I LOOIC THIS I LIKIC THIS I LIKEC THIS I LIKE TTHIS I LIKE THIIS I LIKE THISS I LIKE THIS CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT. ALI, ONE LAST POINT HERE. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE MILLENNIALS ARE INDIVIDUALISTS. HOW WE APPEAL TO THEM, IT'S CONSERVATISM THAT WANTS YOU TO BE FREE AND THINK THE WAY YOU WANT TO THINK. THAT KIND OF INDEPENDENCE AND INDIVIDUALISM APPEALS TO OUR
