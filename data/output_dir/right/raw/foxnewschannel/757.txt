1
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:06,912
THE V.A. SECRETARY WILL HAVE

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,314
HISS HEARING.

3
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:15,554
>>> BETWEEN PROTESTORS ATTACKING

4
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:16,087
SANDERS AND NELSON.

5
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:20,859
ALSO MELANIA TRUMP GETTING

6
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:25,197
SLAMMED FOR HER CLOTHING CHOSES

7
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:29,734
ARE WOMEN TWEETED DIFFERENTLY?

8
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:34,372
I HAVE A PANEL, GOOD MORNING

9
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,807
LADIES, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH

10
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:36,174
US.

11
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:37,809
>> GOOD MORNING.

12
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,544
>> CANDACE IS THERE A DOUBLE

13
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:39,978
STANDARD?

14
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:42,581
>> OF COURSE THERE IS A DOUBLE

15
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:43,982
STANDARD.

16
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:49,754
IT'S INCOMPREHENSIVEBLE.

17
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:51,389
ANYONE WOULD ADMIT THAT WAS

18
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:51,890
WRONG.

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,727
I COULDN'T IMAGE THAT OBAMA'S

20
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:58,263
DAUGHTERS IS THREATENED WITH

21
00:00:58,263 --> 00:00:59,965
PEDOPHILIA AND A MEMBER IS

22
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:01,700
KICKED OUT OF A RESTAURANT.

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,235
YOU WOULD NEVER HEAR THE END OF

24
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:05,370
THE CLAIMS OF RACISM.

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,872
IT SHOULD EVENT BE ALLOWED

26
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:09,074
BECAUSE IT'S DONALD TRUMP'S

27
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:10,375
ADMINISTRATION.

28
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,845
>> MY RESPONSE IS THERE ARE TWO

29
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,647
ISSUES HERE.

30
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:18,583
THERE IS A CIVILITY ISSUE.

31
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,418
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THROWN

32
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:25,690
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT.

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,993
WE DON'T DENY PEOPLE SERVICE.

34
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:31,029
WE CAN LEGALLY ON THE BASES OF

35
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:32,964
POLITICAL AFFILIATION.

36
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:34,766
THE OTHER SIDE TO THE ISSUE IS

37
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:42,040
THE FACT THAT REPUBLICAN WOMEN

38
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:45,010
HAVE THE SAME KIND OF CLOUT AS

39
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,411
WOMEN ON THE LEFT.

40
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,647
THE POLICIES OUT OF THE

41
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,815
ADMINISTRATION HURT THEM.

42
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:52,183
>> BUT WOMEN THAT WORK FOR THE

43
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:55,086
PRESIDENT WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

44
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,122
THEY WOULD SAY WE BELIEVE IN

45
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:58,723
THESE ISSUES.

46
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:00,492
>> YEAH, YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU

47
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:03,228
WANT THE STATISTICS DON'T LIE.

48
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:07,365
IF YOU RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE

49
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:11,803
TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE WORKING AT

50
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:13,705
MINIMUM WAGE ARE WOMEN.

51
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:16,775
>> PLEASE, I HATE THIS SELECTIVE

52
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,610
FEMINISM WE HERE ON THE LEFT.

53
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,012
DON'T MAKE THIS A FEMINISM ISSUE

54
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:24,215
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

55
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:25,317
>> IT IS --

56
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,184
>> I'M NOT DONE.

57
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:27,786
YOU ARE NOT A FEMINIST.

58
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,121
YOU SIT HERE AND SAY YOU CARE

59
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,757
ABOUT MOTHERS, THE BASES OF THIS

60
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:35,894
IS PEOPLE ARE UPSET THAT ILLEGAL

61
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,096
IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY

62
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:41,032
FROM THEIR MOTHERS.

63
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:46,404
WHY NOT PUT THIS INTERGOOD I --

64
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,039
ENERGY INTO BLACK COMMUNITIES.

65
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,041
THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

66
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,576
FAMILIES ALL THE TIME.

67
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,478
THIS IS REALLY LOST ON ME.

68
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:55,714
IT'S TIMES UP ON THIS

69
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:56,114
ALTOGETHER.

70
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:57,248
THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS HAD

71
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:01,886
ENOUGH OF YOU BEING SELECTIVELY

72
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:03,121
OUTRAGED.

73
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:06,124
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR SIX

74
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:06,624
DECADES.

75
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:13,131
>> I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

76
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:14,599
LET'S KEEP THIS CIVIL.

77
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,569
>> I BELIEVE I WAS KEEPING IT

78
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,973
CIVIL THEN CANDACE TOLD ME I

79
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:24,209
WASN'T A FEMINIST.

80
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:24,642
>> LADIES.

81
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:26,044
>> I SAID THE LEFT.

82
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:29,481
I DIDN'T SAY YOU, THE LEFT.

83
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:30,515
>> I DISAGREE.

84
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:32,650
I'LL DO THAT POLITELY.

85
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,787
I'LL RETURN TO MY ORIGINAL

86
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:36,154
ARGUMENT.

87
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:40,992
WE HEARD THIS FOUR YEARS THAT

88
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:43,862
KELLYANN AND OWL

89
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:43,895
KELLYANN AND AWL

90
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:44,863
KELLYANN AND ALL OF THE WOMEN

91
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,498
ARE NOT GETTING THEIR DUE.

92
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:49,467
THEY ARE ADVOCATING FOR POLICIES

93
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,969
THAT HURT WOMEN.

94
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:57,742
THEY KEEP THEM IN A BAD ECONOMIC

95
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:59,844
SYSTEM.

96
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:03,481
>> CAN I ASK YOU THIS?

97
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,183
WHAT ABOUT BLACK WOMEN.

98
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:07,052
>> DO YOU THINK NELSON SHOULD BE

99
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:08,453
TREATED THE WAY SHE DOES?

100
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:10,488
SHE WAS FORCED OUT OF THE

101
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:12,390
MEXICAN RESTAURANT.

102
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,526
DO YOU THINK THE WAY SHE'S BEEN

103
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:15,927
TREATED WAS FAIR.

104
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:18,596
>> I BELIEVE WHAT SHE DID IN

105
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:20,398
COMING OUT AND LYING ABOUT WHAT

106
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:23,234
THE POLICY DID AND THE HAVING TO

107
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:23,701
BACKTRACK --

108
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,236
>> THAT WASN'T MY QUESTION.

109
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:27,572
>> I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD

110
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:29,307
HAVE CIVIL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

111
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:32,410
IT AND HAVE EVER RIGHT TO COME

112
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,878
UP TO HERITABLE AND CALL HER OUT

113
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:36,581
ON HER LIES AND THIS

114
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,515
ADMINISTRATIONS LIES.

115
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:39,350
IF SHE LEAVES BECAUSE OF IT

116
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,351
THAT'S ON HER.

117
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:42,353
SHE SHOULD BE OPEN TO THAT

118
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,189
DIALOG.

119
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,723
>> CANDACE, VERY QUICKLY, THIS

120
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:48,326
IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

121
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:49,961
YOU SAID THE LEFT SHOULD STOP

122
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:56,301
THIS AND THIS WILL BE BE

123
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:56,334
THIS AND THIS WILL BE AE

124
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,235
THIS AND THIS WILL BE ALLOWED IN

125
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,470
THE ADMINISTRATIONS.

126
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,505
NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THE FATHERS

127
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,607
THAT ARE BEHIND BARS OR BURIED

128
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,943
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND

129
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:05,477
BALTIMORE.

130
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,679
THIS IS OUT OUTRAGE AND I DON'T

131
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,847
UNDERSTAND IT.

132
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:11,783
>> WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.

133
00:05:11,783 --> 00:00:00,000
>> HIS FATHER --
