1
00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:01,246
GREG GUTFELD.

2
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:02,848
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND

3
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:10,422
THIS IS "THE FIVE" ."

4
00:00:10,422 --> 00:00:12,691
WHAT DOES ROBERT MUELLER WANT TO

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,625
ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP?

6
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:14,759
DOZENS OF QUESTIONS ARE NOW OUT

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,661
OF THE PUBLIC FOR THE WORLD TO

8
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:17,229
SEE.

9
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:18,230
QUESTIONS THAT WERE REPORTEDLY

10
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,832
READ TO THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM AND

11
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:22,834
THEN LINK TO THE MEDIA.

12
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,403
THE PRESIDENT CALLED THE LEAKS

13
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:25,837
DISGRACEFUL.

14
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:27,405
SARAH SANDERS DIRECTED QUESTIONS

15
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:30,108
FOR LEGAL TEAM EARLIER BUT HER

16
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:31,610
DEPUTY RAJ SHAH HAD THIS TO SAY.

17
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,845
>> I DON'T KNOW THE VERACITY OF

18
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:35,647
THE ACCURACY OF THE LEAK IF THEY

19
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:38,049
ARE ACCURATE, THE OVERWHELMING

20
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:38,850
MAJORITY OF THOSE QUESTIONS

21
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,385
DON'T FOCUS ON THE UNDERLYING

22
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:42,420
PREMISE OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

23
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,922
WHICH WAS TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE

24
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:45,423
OF COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN

25
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:45,824
GOVERNMENT.

26
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,226
THERE HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR OF

27
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:48,660
INVESTIGATION.

28
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,863
THERE'S BEEN DOZENS OF

29
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:52,597
WITNESSES, THOUSANDS, MILLIONS

30
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:54,666
PAGES OF DOCUMENTS PROVIDED.

31
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,634
A ZERO EVIDENCE.

32
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:57,469
NOT A SHRED OF EVIDENCE OF

33
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,237
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP

34
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,005
CAMPAIGN IN THE RUSSIAN

35
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:00,405
GOVERNMENT.

36
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:05,176
>> Kimberly: ALLY -- ALAN

37
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:08,046
DERSHOWITZ THINKS THERE'S A

38
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:09,481
STRATEGY DESIGNED TO TRIP UP

39
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:09,948
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

40
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:12,417
>> THE QUESTIONS ARE INARTFULLY

41
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:13,418
DRAWN.

42
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:14,619
THEY ARE WRITTEN AS OPEN-ENDED

43
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,654
QUESTIONS.

44
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:17,289
THEY ARE DESIGNED TO LET HIM

45
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:18,423
RAMBLE AND TALK, AND I SUSPECT

46
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:20,225
THAT IS THE STRATEGY OF THE

47
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,594
SPECIAL COUNSEL BECAUSE THEY

48
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:23,094
KNOW THAT THEY BE

49
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:25,730
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WEAKNESS, IF

50
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,199
THEY WERE TO ASK HIM DIRECT,

51
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:29,668
TOUGH QUESTIONS TO WHICH HE CAN

52
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:31,136
ANSWER YES OR NO, THAT MIGHT NOT

53
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,470
GIVE THEM THE ADVANTAGE THEY ARE

54
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,873
SEEKING.

55
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:36,641
>> Kimberly: DERSHOWITZ

56
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,243
DISCUSSING THE STRATEGY THAT HE

57
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,679
THINKS IS BEING EMPLOYED.

58
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:41,613
ASK THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTION SO

59
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,748
HE CAN GIVE A LONG AND LENGTHY

60
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:44,849
ANSWER AND THERE MAY BE SOME

61
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:46,551
DETAILS IN THERE TO TRIP HIM UP.

62
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,820
>> Dana: I DON'T KNOW.

63
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,521
I THINK THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL

64
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:52,023
ENOUGH TO KNOW MAY BE THEY HAVE

65
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:52,424
SOMETHING.

66
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:53,224
MAYBE THEY DON'T.

67
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:54,626
NONE OF US REALLY KNOW BUT I

68
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,227
THINK YES, THE QUESTIONS WERE

69
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:56,628
OPEN-ENDED.

70
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,263
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IT'S REALLY

71
00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:00,365
UNUSUAL FOR ANYONE TO BE GIVEN A

72
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,233
LIST, ESPECIALLY 44 OR 49

73
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,569
QUESTIONS, HOWEVER MANY IT WAS,

74
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,270
BEFOREHAND.

75
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,271
I COULD SEE WHY THEY ARE

76
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:07,272
OPEN-ENDED.

77
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,673
IF YOU STARTED PROVIDING ALL THE

78
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:09,841
QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD WANT A

79
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,042
"YES" OR "NO" ANSWER TO, THEN

80
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,911
THAT WOULD LOOK A LITTLE WEIRD

81
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:13,645
TOO.

82
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,647
THIS IS A RANGE OF TOPICS THAT

83
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:20,285
WE WANT TO GO OVER WITH HIM.

84
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:21,086
MANY OF THESE COULD BE A WOLF IN

85
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,655
SHEEP'S CLOTHING.

86
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:25,857
I HAD A LAWYER ON THE 2:00 SHOW

87
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:26,157
TODAY.

88
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:27,459
IT COULD END UP BEING SOMETHING

89
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,628
WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE

90
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:32,430
YOUR CLIENT DO AN INTERVIEW.

91
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,865
I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLY THE

92
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:34,499
STRATEGY BEHIND THE LEAK.

93
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:36,468
I DON'T THINK THIS LEAK CAME

94
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:37,068
FROM THE MUELLER TEAM.

95
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,738
I THINK IT CAME FROM SOMEBODY

96
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:42,273
EITHER ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGAL

97
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:43,041
TEAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

98
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,276
TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT CAN I GET

99
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:46,845
IT OUT THERE.

100
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:47,779
LET EVERYBODY START TALKING

101
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:49,347
ABOUT IT AND THEN EITHER, FOR

102
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,650
THE LAWYERS TO BE ABLE TO SAVE

103
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,384
MR. PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY THINKS

104
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:54,419
YOU SHOULDN'T DO AN INTERVIEW

105
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:54,853
WITH MUELLER.

106
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,921
TRY TO GET HIM TO AGREE.

107
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:59,224
>> Kimberly: ALL RIGHT, GREG,

108
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,092
HOW DO YOU SEE IT?

109
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:04,229
>> Greg: I THINK THE LEAK CAME

110
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:05,430
FROM "FOX & FRIENDS."

111
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,164
TREASURE TROVE.

112
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,066
WE KEEP HEARING THE PHRASE

113
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:08,833
TREASURE TROVE.

114
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,869
THIS IS A TREASURE TROVE.

115
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:11,236
MAY BE.

116
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:13,038
BUT IT MIGHT BE A TREASURE TROVE

117
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:15,640
FOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE IF

118
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,708
YOU'RE GOING TO BE COUNTING ON

119
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,842
WINNING THE HOUSE, I DON'T KNOW

120
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:18,843
IF THIS RUSSIAN STUFF IS GOING

121
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:19,644
TO HELP YOU.

122
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:21,479
I THINK OVER TIME THIS IS

123
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,484
BECOMING A SQUALID DISCRETION --

124
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:31,156
DISTRACTION.

125
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:31,890
I THINK TRUMP SHOULD SAY WE WILL

126
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,590
ANSWER THESE THINGS IN WRITING

127
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,291
AND THEN BEAT PEOPLE OVER THE

128
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:33,825
HEAD WITH IT.

129
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:35,927
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON

130
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:38,296
IN THE WORLD, WHAT IS MISSING?

131
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,865
WHAT ARE WE NOT SAY NOW THAT WE

132
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:42,834
USED TO SEE DOING "THE FIVE"?

133
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:43,435
ISIS VIDEOS.

134
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,236
ALMOST EVERY WEEK WE SAW AN ISIS

135
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:45,637
VIDEO.

136
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,505
FOR MONTHS, WE TALKED ABOUT THE

137
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:49,641
NUCLEAR THREAT OF NORTH KOREA.

138
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:51,076
THESE ARE TWO EXISTENTIAL

139
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:51,910
THREATS MISSING FROM THE

140
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,911
NEWSFEED.

141
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:55,480
I DO THINK THE MEDIA IS

142
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,451
COMPLETELY UNPREPARED TO REPORT

143
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:00,051
TRUMP'S SUCCESSES.

144
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,853
THEY DON'T HAVE IT IN THEIR

145
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:02,654
TOOLBOX.

146
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:03,488
YOU HAVE TWO MAJOR THINGS

147
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:05,323
MISSING AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

148
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:07,659
TO REPORT, SO YOU FOCUS ON

149
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,527
PORNOGRAPHY AND YOUR FOCUS ON

150
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:10,295
COLLUSION.

151
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,663
COLLUSION WHICH IS FALLING APART

152
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:12,664
AND HAS BEEN FALLING APART.

153
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:13,998
NOW IT'S GOING TO BECOME ABOUT

154
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:14,399
OBSTRUCTION.

155
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,500
THEY DON'T HAVE IT IN THEIR

156
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,067
TOOLKIT SO THEY ARE LEFT DOING

157
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:17,668
THIS.

158
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:18,536
WHAT'S THE END RESULT?

159
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,572
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.

160
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,906
IF YOU IMPEACH A PRESIDENT IN

161
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:23,408
THE MIDDLE OF SOME REALLY

162
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:24,576
HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENTS, HISTORY

163
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:25,677
WILL NOT BE KIND TO YOU.

164
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:27,612
THE VOTERS WILL NOT BE KIND TO

165
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:27,879
YOU.

166
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,647
NO ONE WILL BE KIND TO YOU.

167
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:30,281
>> Kimberly: INTERESTING.

168
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:33,151
YOU ARE SAYING THE MEDIA HAS GOT

169
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,786
A VERY EMPTY BOX.

170
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:38,656
SNAP-ON TOOLS.

171
00:04:38,656 --> 00:00:00,000
SNAP OFF MEDIA.
