1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,330
ON SUNDAY MORNING, THERE WAS A
TRAGIC DEATH INVOLVING AN NFL

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,800
PLAYER BY THE NAME OF EDWIN
JACKSON.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,550
HE WAS THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS
LINEBACKER AND HE WAS IN AN UBER

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,150
AT THAT TIME WHEN A DRUNK DRIVER
UNFORTUNATELY HIT THE CAR

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,029
AND HE LOST HIS LIFE AND SO DID
THE INDIVIDUAL DRIVING THE UBER.

6
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:25,829
CBS'S THIS MORNING HAS MORE ON
THE STORY.

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,439
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND
THEN I WILL GIVE YOU

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,820
TRUMP'S REACTION TO IT.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,319
AROUND 4 O'CLOCK SUNDAY
MORNING IN INDIANAPOLIS,

10
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:35,170
JACKSON AND HIS UBER DRIVER
WERE KILLED.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,039
THEIR CAR WAS PULLED OVER ON
THE SIDE OF INTERSTATE 70

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,570
BECAUSE JACKSON FELT SICK.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,540
BOTH OF THE MEN WERE OUTSIDE THE
VEHICLE WHEN I LIKE FORD F150

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,840
TRUCK PLOWED INTO THEM.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,489
THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT THREW
ONE OF THE MEN INTO THE

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,760
CENTER LANE WHERE HE WAS LATER
ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK BY A

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
POLICE VEHICLE.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,949
HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE A BROTHER,
I LOOK AT HIM LIKE A BROTHER.

19
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:58,359
THAT IS HIS ROOMMATE WHO HAD
GONE OUT WITH HIM THE NIGHT

20
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,359
HE WAS KILLED.

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,920
HE ACTUALLY DID THE RIGHT
THING AND HE TOOK AN UBER.

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,230
HE WAS MAKING THE RIGHT STEPS TO
GET HOME SAFELY AND NOT PUT

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,820
ANYONE ELSE IN HARM'S WAY.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,930
THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK
WAS

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,000
ARRESTED WITH A BLOOD
ALCOHOL LEVEL NEARLY 3

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,700
TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT ACCORDING
TO A POLICE AFFIDAVIT.

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,850
THE SUSPECT USED AN ALIAS AND
WAS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGAL.

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,670
INVESTIGATORS SAY HE WAS
DEPORTED TO GUATEMALA IN

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,399
2007 AND AGAIN IN 2009.

30
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,560
SO HE WAS DEPORTED TWICE
BUT HE FOUND HIS WAY BACK

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,940
INTO THE UNITED STATES.

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,640
HE WAS UNDOCUMENTED OBVIOUSLY
AND DRUNK BEHIND THE WHEEL.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,240
HE IS IN CUSTODY.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,810
TRUMP USED THIS AS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH HIS

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,119
ANTI-IMMIGRATION AGENDA.

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:53,450
IN A TWEET HE SAID 

37
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,590
THE
FOLLOWING:

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,090
SO THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM
TRUMP.

39
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,560
HE CONTINUOUSLY MAKES THE CASE
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,990
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY ARE MORE
LIKELY TO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,110
AND MORE LIKELY TO DRIVE DRUNK
BUT THE STUDIES THAT HAVE

42
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,319
BEEN DONE ON THIS VERY ISSUE
PROVE OTHERWISE AND WE WILL

43
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,670
GET INTO THOSE DETAILS IN JUST A
MOMENT BUT IT IS A TRAGIC

44
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,790
STORY AND I AM DEVASTATED FOR
HIS FAMILY.

45
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,260
IF YOU WANT TO DO, TARGET ANY
GROUP, YOU CAN DO IS SUPER

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,360
EASILY BECAUSE THERE ARE
THOUSANDS OF HOMICIDES FOR

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,599
EXAMPLE EVERY YEAR, THERE'S
THOUSANDS OF DRUNK DRIVING

48
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,000
ACCIDENTS EVERY YEAR AND SO IF
YOU WANT TO TARGET ASIANS FOR

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,950
EXAMPLE, YOU COULD TAKE EXAMPLES
OF THREE DRUNK DRIVING

50
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,790
CRASHES, FIVE, 17 IN THE COUNTRY
EASILY AND JUST TALK ABOUT

51
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,790
IT NONSTOP.

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,860
OH MY GOD, AND THIS
PERSON WAS KILLED BY AN

53
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,690
ASIAN DRIVER, THIS PERSON WAS
KILLED BY AN ASIAN DRIVER AND SO

54
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,069
EVERYONE IS LIKE OH MY GOD, WHAT
IS GOING ON WITH ASIAN DRIVERS?

55
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,910
THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC BUT IN
REALITY, YOU CAN LOOK AT

56
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,242
THE NUMBERS AND SAY WAIT, IS
THERE A DISPROPORTIONATE

57
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:06,909
NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING KILLED
BY ASIAN DRUNK DRIVERS OR

58
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,550
ASIAN HOMICIDES OR WHATEVER IT
IS THAT THEY'RE MAKING UP,

59
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,890
I AM TAKING A RANDOM
HYPOTHETICAL AND THE

60
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,099
REALITY WOULD BE NO, THERE IS
NO EPIDEMIC AND IT IS NOT

61
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,950
STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT THAN
ANYTHING ELSE.

62
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,580
IN THIS CASE, LET'S FIND OUT.

63
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,209
LET'S GO TO THE FACTS, DO
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS

64
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,190
CREATE AND COMMIT MORE CRIME OR
NOT?

65
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:41,900
SO LET'S FIRST GO TO DATA
THAT WE HAVE FROM 

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,959
THE CENSUS.

67
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,950
SO THIS TALKING POINT THAT WE
HEAR TIME AND TIME AGAIN FROM

68
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,450
THE HARD RIGHT IS NOT TRUE.

69
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,060
THEY ARE NOT MORE LIKELY TO BE
VIOLENT CRIMINALS.

70
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,970
IT IS WORSE THAN THAT.

71
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,000
CITIZENS ARE MORE LIKELY TO
COMMIT CRIMES.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,860
IN THE 18-39 GROUP AND THAT IS
A HUGE STUDY

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,170
SO WHEN YOU HEAR THESE
IMMIGRANTS ARE CREATING

74
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,079
MORE CRIMES, IT IS NOT TRUE.

75
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,779
IT IS NOT TRUE.

76
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,479
THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE SHOULD
TAKE IT ALL THE CITIZENS

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,440
AND LEAVE ONLY THE UNDOCUMENTED
PEOPLE.

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,080
THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS BUT
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,550
DEMAGOGUERY NOT BACKED UP BY THE
FACTS AT ALL.

80
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,420
IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS
TRUE.

81
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,380
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GENERAL
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN THE

82
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:42,630
UNITED STATES:

83
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,080
IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE
GENERAL POPULATION OF

84
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,270
NONCITIZENS IN THE COUNTRY AND
THEN LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

85
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,440
INMATES YOU CAN SELL THAT
THERE'S A BIT OF A GAP

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:05:05,470
THERE AND BY THE WAY, WHAT ARE
THEY IN PRISON FOR?

87
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,170
IT IS NOT THAT THEY ARE VIOLENT
NONCITIZENS COME OFTENTIMES

88
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,330
THEY CAME BACK TO THE COUNTRY SO
THEY WERE PUT IN CUSTODY AGAIN.

89
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,330
SO WE HAVE A 7% OF THE COUNTRY
IS NONCITIZENS BUT ONLY 5%

90
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,730
OF THE COUNTRY OR NONCITIZEN
SO AGAIN, ANOTHER FACTS

91
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,670
SHOWING THAT THEY ARE LESS
LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMINAL ACTS.

92
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,320
A LOT OF THEM ARE MINORITIES.

93
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,690
WE'VE SHOWN YOU OTHER STUDIES
THAT SHOW THAT MINORITIES ARE

94
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,760
DISPROPORTIONATELY CRY TARGETED
BY POLICE SO THEY ARE ACTUALLY

95
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,900
MORE LIKELY TO BE IN PRISON
BECAUSE OF THAT FACT, BUT STILL

96
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,210
THERE IN PRISON LESS THAN THE
ADDED AVERAGE CITIZEN AND ON TOP

97
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,400
OF THAT, A THIRD ARE IN PRISON
JUST FOR BEING UNDOCUMENTED.

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,150
IF YOU TOOK THAT AWAY IT IS EVEN
MORE DISPROPORTIONATE AND

99
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,910
IT GETS YOU TO ABOUT WITH THE
OTHER STUDIES SHOWED, THAT

100
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,070
THERE HALF AS LIKELY AS AVERAGE
AMERICAN TO COMMIT A CRIME.

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,720
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE CATO
INSTITUTE HAS INVESTIGATED THIS.

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,260
THEY ARE BY NO MEANS A
PROGRESSIVE ORGANIZATION.

103
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,700
THEY'RE LIBERTARIANS AND THEY
HAVE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND

104
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
ONE OF

105
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,110
THE RESEARCHERS SAID IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT I TRY TO DO THE

106
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,000
NUMBERS, NO MATTER WHAT I COME
OUT WITH THE SAME RESULTS.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,610
NONCITIZENS ARE NOT MORE LIKELY
OR NOT EVEN AS LIKELY AS US

108
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,970
CITIZENS TO COMMIT CRIMES.

109
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,360
NOW LET'S LOOK AT DRUNK DRIVING
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THAT IS

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:42,170
WHAT THIS STORY HAS TO DO WITH.

111
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,620
SO WE HAVE MORE UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO THE

112
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,860
COUNTRY BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE
STATS OF DRUNK DRIVING YOU

113
00:06:47,860 --> 00:07:02,960
SEE A SIGNIFICANT DROP.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:16,920
ALSO:

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,360
SO IF THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF
CRIME BROUGHT IN BY UNDOCUMENTED

116
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,600
IMMIGRANTS, CRIME WOULD NOT HAVE
GONE DOWN, IT WOULD'VE GONE UP.

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,200
THERE ARE ACTUALLY MANY FACTORS
AS TO WHY VIOLENT CRIME

118
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,630
WENT DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THAT
TIME PERIOD, BUT THE IDEA

119
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,700
THAT IMMIGRANTS BROUGHT IN A
WAVE OF CRIME IS PREPOSTEROUS.

120
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,190
TOTALLY COUNTERFACTUAL SO WHEN
YOU SEE STORIES LIKE THIS, IT

121
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,330
IS EASY TO SAY IF WE DIDN'T HAVE
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THEN

122
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,760
THAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED AND EDWIN
JACKSON WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY.

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,030
HE WOULD LIKELY BE ALIVE
TODAY IF THAT PARTICULAR

124
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,890
IMMIGRANTS WAS NOT IN THE
COUNTRY OR HAD NOT BEEN

125
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,030
DRINKING, ETC. AND IT IS A
TRAGEDY BUT TO USE A TRAGEDY

126
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,430
FOR YOUR OWN POLITICAL PURPOSES
AND DEMAGOGUE OVER IT AND

127
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,770
TO CREATE A MISLEADING ANECDOTE
WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT

128
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,600
THE REALITY IN THIS COUNTRY IS,
THAT IS WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES.

129
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,080
IT IS AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO
MAKE A QUICK POINT ABOUT

130
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,300
HOW TRUMP LOVES TO USE CERTAIN
PEOPLE AS PROPS WHEN IT

131
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,460
FITS HIS POLITICAL AGENDA, BUT
AS SOON AS IT DOES NOT, HE

132
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,061
WILL TURN AROUND AND CALL THEM
SONS OF BITCHES SO THAT IS

133
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,600
SOMETHING TO ALSO KEEP IN MIND
WHENEVER HE HAS THE AUDACITY

134
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,140
TO TWEET ABOUT A TRAGEDY LIKE
THIS FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.

135
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,450
IF YOU ARE A BLACK FOOTBALL
PLAYER WHO TOOK A KNEE

136
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,520
DURING THE NATIONALLY THEM,
YOU ARE A SON OF A BIT YOU

137
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,909
SHOULD BE FIRED BUT IF YOU GOT
RUN OVER BY AN UNDOCUMENTED

138
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,089
IMMIGRANT, ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS
LIKE OH MY GOD, NOW I GET

139
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,010
TO BLAME THEM TOO, THANK YOU
FOR BEING MY PROP AND THAT

140
00:08:45,010 --> 00:00:00,000
MAKES THE STORY PARTICULARLY
SICK.
