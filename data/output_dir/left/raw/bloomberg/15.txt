1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,350
I always try to put a little
bit of my soul into a guitar.

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,210
This is a mixture of sweetness,

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,200
which I sometimes have, not always,

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,033
and a little bit of bravery.

5
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,008
The part that I love the
most about working with wood

6
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:45,110
is touching it, the feeling
of the wood in my hands.

7
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,920
It's something that always
reminds me about who I am,

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,153
where are my roots, where I belong to.

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,450
The wood needs to be dried
at least for 30 years,

10
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,410
which means that I'm using the materials

11
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,760
that my grandfather bought.

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,760
Iâ€™ve never met him; he died
one month before I was born.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,888
So I get to touch the
things that he picked

14
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,750
without knowing they would be for me,

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,680
because I'm the first woman
in the family to make guitars.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,259
So it's quite special.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,432
Once you have picked the material,

18
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:21,270
then you start to prepare
all the parts of the guitar.

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,793
We always start with shaping of the neck.

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,990
The second part, it's the top.

21
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,370
When we decide the materials,

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,660
we decide which one of the
templates that we have,

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,499
that we're gonna use.

24
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:45,270
The first thing that
you do when you cut it

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,487
is to put it in the solera.

26
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:50,090
The solera is the mold that we
use for the top and the back

27
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,090
to give the guitar this little
curve so it sounds better.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,270
And then for the top, we need
to put the rosette in it.

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,110
And it's little pieces of wood,

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,820
and we make the drawing, the design,

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,070
and we have to start
putting every single piece

32
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,800
so it matches.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,360
The rosette, it's one of the
most difficult parts to do.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,710
But it's also one of
the most creative ones,

35
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,073
where you are allowed
to do whatever you want.

36
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,050
It takes me like two months and a half

37
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,300
to make a couple of guitars,

38
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,590
because we are always
making a couple of them

39
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,313
so when one is gluing we
can work with the other one.

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,460
Actually when a guitar is gluing

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,670
you're going to use
this old form of clamp.

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,060
These ones we made ourselves here,

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,443
so we can put pressure on the guitar.

44
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:43,960
The flamenco and classical
guitar they may look equal

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,740
but in the construction
they are different.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,930
Classical player, they always look

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,408
for a neat note, bright sound.

48
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:55,478
But the flamenco ones,
they just want soul.

49
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,990
Everybody asks about the sides bending.

50
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,070
You have to put them under the
water for a couple of hours

51
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,313
and then you do this bending with heat.

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,845
We use a little oven and
if you get the wood wet,

53
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:17,010
through the process you can bend the sides

54
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,531
to the shape of the guitar.

55
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:25,440
The Conde business started with

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,503
an uncle of my grandfather in 1915.

57
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:34,280
Nowadays, in this workshop
we are three people,

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
plus my father.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,550
At first, continuing the tradition,

60
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,160
it was not something that I had in mind.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,890
My father suggested me to come

62
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,943
to the workshop in the
evenings, just to try.

63
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,220
And I found it beautiful to know

64
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,157
how the family business worked
and how to make a guitar.

65
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,680
The first guitar that I closed,
I remember going back home

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,103
and my smile couldn't be bigger.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,550
Because it's the first moment

68
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,100
that you see a complete guitar.

69
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,459
For joining of the back, we
need to put enough pressure

70
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,479
to stick the back and the sides,

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,133
but it's not so much so
the sides could break.

72
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,020
The tradition is to give your
first guitar to your mother,

73
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,100
but I'm not a boy, so I decided
to give it to my father,

74
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,600
which was my master.

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,580
I was totally afraid that
it would be a mistake

76
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,850
and a mess and it wouldn't sound.

77
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,180
But it did sound, and it did sound well,

78
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,630
and I couldn't be more proud.

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,173
I remember this as one of the
most exciting days of my life.

80
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,220
Once you have stuck all the guitar together,

81
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,290
then you start with the fingerboard.

82
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,030
We always use ebony, from Africa.

83
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,650
It's a really tough material because

84
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,580
it has a lot of density,
it's really heavy.

85
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,910
You have to be very careful in

86
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,560
the distribution of the frets.

87
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,410
If you are mistaken by just one millimeter

88
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,573
you wouldn't be able to tune
it, it would be impossible.

89
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,623
After that you only have
to give the last touches.

90
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,290
Once a guitar is finished,
you have to adjust

91
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,600
the neck bone and the bridge bone.

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,471
And this is really important because

93
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:43,123
that will decide the
tension of the strings.

94
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,130
Sometimes you need a whole
day to adjust a guitar,

95
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,023
to find it perfect.

96
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,710
But I guess it will never be perfect

97
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,800
because it depends on the
person who plays the guitar.

98
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:24,420
I have really good memories
with flamenco music

99
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,040
and then for me it means home actually.

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,183
It comes from the heart of a person.

101
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,860
I have this romantic idea
that this is my grain,

102
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,030
that I live in this world so
someone else can make music,

103
00:06:52,620 --> 00:00:00,000
which gives life to all of us.
