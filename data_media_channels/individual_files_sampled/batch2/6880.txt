so Michael code of course was the personal attorney for Donald Trump and his office his hotel room in his home were all raided they have all of his documents Donald Trump is in an absolute panic breaking news that just happened right before we went live Rudy Giuliani is going to join Donald Trump's personal legal team so former mayor of New York and an attorney in New York joining Trump's team now that turns out to be very relevant to the story I had already prepared for you guys because Michael Cohen first of all might at some point flip on Donald Trump we'll get to that in a second but some people also thought well it's okay well the president can pardon him and there's double jeopardy and person can't be tried for the same crime twice so if the president pardons him the state of New York might not be able to prosecute Michael Cohen well first of all let's take a look at that because right now the case in in in federal hands not at state hands and that's important so law and crime explains under the US Constitution it's perfectly fine for a person to be prosecuted in state court following a federal prosecution for the same crime because states have their own authority so it actually would not be double jeopardy so if the federal government prosecutes Michael Cohen but Donald Trump pardons him the states could go after him as well but in New York there's a law that affects this and is actually would normally help Michael Cohen so in New York state law prohibits the prosecution of a person in state court when that person has already been prosecuted for that same Act even if the original prosecution was a federal one so in New York you have extra protections and so Michael Cohen could say well I mean look the feds already tried me on this so a New York State can't do anything here well here comes the Attorney General for New York Eric Schneiderman and he just sent a letter to the governor and a group of legislators asking them to change New York state law so that if Trump pardons Michael Cohen there will be any procedural hang-ups to hinder a state prosecution of Cohen now given that Eric Schneiderman is not a big fan of Donald he prosecutor Donald Trump for Trump University and got a civil settlement of 25 million dollars that just happened a little while back and he'd actually been pursuing that case since 2013 so for him it's not political he's just going after a scam artist and then you've got Cuomo who might run for president who would love to show that he's being tough on Trump and you've got the Democrats running in New York so amending that law seems eminently doable so then Michael Cohen would be exposed under New York state law and in a world of trouble because then he couldn't be pardoned so law and crime explains that federal prosecutors intentionally backed away from prosecuting some crimes to preserve those prosecution for state prosecutors that'd be a brilliant way to circumvent the power of an impending pardon so there's a second option for federal prosecutors if I guess has that Trump is going to pardon Michael Cohen they could just choose not to prosecute him they could just hand it off to New York and New York and prosecute him so oops that means that Michael Cohen in essence cannot be pardoned by Trump or that Trump's federal pardon would be meaningless and Michael Cohen would be facing an enormous amount of jail time in instead so whether New York's gonna go after him is relevant it's irrelevant to the Giuliani story and it's gonna be relevant to this next part of the story Wall Street Journal reporting what a president Donald Trump's longtime legal advisors said that he warned the president and a phone call Friday that Michael Cohen mr. Trump's personal lawyer and close friend would turn against the President and cooperate with federal prosecutors if faced with criminal charges and by the way he will almost certainly be faced with criminal charges so now whether this guy is right is an open question but he knows the president he knows Michael Cohen here's more details mr. Trump made the call seeking advice from Jay Goldberg who represented mr. Trump in the 1990s in the early 2000s mr. Goldberg said he cautioned the president not to trust mr. Cohen on a scale of 100 to one where 100 is fully protecting the president mr. Cohen quote isn't even a one he said he told mr. Trump Wow it's like do not trust that snake at all well the reason he's Trump's lawyer in the first place is because he's a snake with Trump wanted him because Michael Cole would be willing to do things that other lawyers were not willing to do and would a guy like that turn on him well Trump's previous lawyers saying of course of course he's gonna turn on you on a scale of 1 to 100 on how much you should trust them less than a 1 Wow Goldberg told the president quote Michael will never stand up for you now before the raid Michael Cohen was tweeting John I'm always going to stand up for the President and and Trump told Goldberg no no no I think Michael is very strong very strong and good luck with that and by the way Goldberg also tailed Trump whatever you do do not talk to prosecutors that's a really bad idea Trump like why I'm gonna outsmart Muller it's something that he's told advisers in the past and Goldberg his previous attorneys like new you are not he knows his client he knows his client as a pathological liar and an idiot and would get would say all sorts of incriminating things to the prosecutors so let's hope he doesn't listen to Goldberg on either one of these counts anyway and they call mr. Goldberg a former prosecutor who represented mr. Trump in divorce and real estate matters said he told the president mr. Cohn could even agreed to wear a wire and try to record conversations with mr. Trump he said quote you have to be alert I don't care what Michael says so he's saying look and the President did talk to Michael Cohen recently so he could be wearing a wire II know Trump he's a buffoon he's okay Michael what are you doing you're still being strong right well you're gonna protect me on all the things we did right Michael oh please tell me that you are that stupid mrs. former lawyer knowing Trump going oh don't do it oh dude don't talk to him okay awesome now little context for you guys speaking from his experience as a prosecutor he said he even hardened that even hardened organized crime figures flip under pressure from the government quote the mob was broken by Sammy the bull Gravano caving in out of the prospect of a jail sentence and Goldberg's reference there is basically implicitly saying and Michael Cohen ain't no Sammy the bull Gravano and if they could break him a break Michael Cohen so quick he suggested and this is interesting Goldberg suggested that mr. Trump add a well-known New York lawyer to his legal team and a reason for that sound advice you can't pardon your way out of New York State so if the New York prosecutors come to get you you know in this case they'd go to get Michael Cohen and some of the things that he could be charged with campaign violations bank fraud and let alone the potential threats of violence against stormy Daly's but even if you put that aside he's still facing up potentially decades of prison time and he can't be pardoned in the state of New York so tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick and go Birds and get a New York lawyer and today as I just told you Giuliani a New York lawyer is stepping up and becoming part of Donald Trump's legal team this is not gonna end well for Donald Trump you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
