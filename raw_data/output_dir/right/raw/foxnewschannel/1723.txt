JESSE WATTERS, AND JUAN WILLIAM

JUAN WILLIAMS.

5
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,018
THE WHITE HOUSE IS FIGHTING A

6
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:14,421
BRAND-NEW BATTLE TO COMBAT

7
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,121
INTERNAL LEAKS.

8
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:16,122
PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKING A TWITTER

9
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:19,259
TO BLAST STAFFERS FOR THE LATEST

10
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,827
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES.

11
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:21,761
THE LEAKS COMING OUT OF THE

12
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:24,397
WHITE HOUSE ARE MASSIVE OVER

13
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:27,234
EXAGGERATION PUT OUT BY THE FAKE

14
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,370
NEWS MEDIA

15
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,104
IN ORDER TO MAKE US LOOK AS BAD

16
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:31,671
AS POSSIBLE.

17
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,372
WITH THAT BEING SAID, LEAKERS

18
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:33,240
ARE TRAITORS AND COWARDS, AND WE

19
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,611
WILL FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE!"

20
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,012
KELLYANNE CONWAY IS WARNING BIG

21
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:39,779
CHANGES ARE COMING AND THESE

22
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,415
LEAKERS COULD BE KICKED TO THE

23
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:42,716
CURB.

24
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:46,353
>> THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF LEAKS.

25
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:48,421
SOME EXIST TO HER COLLEAGUES.

26
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,023
SOME EXIST BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE

27
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:50,790
WITH POLICIES.

28
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,026
BUT NONE OF THEM ARE HELPFUL.

29
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,028
I WILL SAY SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S

30
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:56,162
GOING ON IN THIS WHITE HOUSE BUT

31
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,064
NOT AS BADLY AS IT WAS IN THE

32
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:58,832
BEGINNING.

33
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:00,433
IT'S NOT SO MUCH LEAKING.

34
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:07,007
IT IS USING THE MEDIA TO SHIV

35
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:07,407
EACH OTHER.

36
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:09,409
YOU HAVE THE BLESSING OF COMING

37
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,778
TO WORK EVERY DAY IN THIS

38
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:12,178
WHITE HOUSE.

39
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:14,314
>> DO YOU EXPECT PERSONNEL

40
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:14,648
CHANGES?

41
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:18,418
>> I DO.

42
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:19,719
>> Kimberly: STRONG WORDS

43
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,820
COMING NOT ONLY FROM THE

44
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,622
PRESIDENT BUT HIS STAFFERS.

45
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:23,523
HE'S VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE AT

46
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:26,026
A TIME LIKE THIS YOU WANT TO BE

47
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,761
FOCUSING ON ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

48
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:29,496
GOALS, CAMPAIGN PROMISES

49
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:30,030
FULFILLED.

50
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,897
ALL THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT

51
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,232
HAVE BEEN COMING OUT OF THE

52
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:33,900
WHITE HOUSE, BUT THEN YOU HAVE

53
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,135
THESE LEAKS WHICH MAKES IT

54
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:35,535
FRUSTRATING.

55
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:38,905
>> Jesse: AS COMEY SAYS,

56
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:40,440
THERE'S A LOT OF WEASEL MOVES BE

57
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,042
MADE AND THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

58
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:44,044
AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT.

59
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:45,011
PRESIDENT TRUMP RINGS OUT THE

60
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:46,546
BEST AND WORST IN PEOPLE BECAUSE

61
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:47,447
HE ENCOURAGES COMPETITION WITH

62
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:51,718
HIS STAFF.

63
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:53,753
THE AN OUTSIDER BUSINESSMAN, HE

64
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:54,988
BROUGHT IN 1,000 DIFFERENT

65
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:56,756
FACTIONS.

66
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:59,826
FAMILIES, LOYALISTS, CAMPAIGN

67
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:02,629
PEOPLE, INSIDERS, MILITARY,

68
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:03,430
IDEOLOGUES, NONIDEOLOGUES.

69
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,764
WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY FACTIONS

70
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:07,667
COMMIT ARE GOING TO HAVE THE

71
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:08,435
DIVERSITY OF OPINION.

72
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:09,836
TRUMP DEVOURS TV AND PRINT MEDIA

73
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:11,037
OBVIOUSLY.

74
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,639
ONE OF THE WAYS YOU INFLUENCE

75
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,207
HIM IS TO LEAK.

76
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,842
HE IS ALSO A TALKER.

77
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:17,043
HE TALKS TO A THOUSAND PEOPLE A

78
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,044
DAY.

79
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:19,713
HE'S ON THE PHONE, CALLING

80
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:20,347
PEOPLE, AND HE'S EXTREMELY

81
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:23,416
EMOTIONAL AND SPEAKS COLORFULLY

82
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,250
AND BLUNTLY.

83
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,919
A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN'T RESIST

84
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,722
THE URGE TO LEAK BECAUSE YOU

85
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:30,690
CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT

86
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,059
SAID.

87
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,361
PEOPLE ARE INSPIRED TO LEAK.

88
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:37,230
>> Kimberly: SO MONEY.

89
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,667
>> Greg: A PHRASE FROM 1990.

90
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,969
>> Dana: HE IS OUR YOUNGEST

91
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:48,642
GUY.

92
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:50,076
>> Jesse: AND THE INSTITUTIONS

93
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:52,045
IN D.C., THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS IN

94
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:54,414
LOVE WITH THE PRESIDENT.

95
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,650
WE KNOW THAT COMEY HIMSELF HATED

96
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,486
TRUMP PERSONALLY, THE FBI PEOPLE

97
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:03,490
TOO, AND BAN LEAKED IN ORDER TO

98
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,525
SIGNAL THE SPECIAL COUNSEL.

99
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:13,800
I THINK JOHN KELLY -- TRUMP CAN

100
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,402
SAY LOOK AT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA

101
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,872
AND DIMINISH THEIR CREDIBILITY.

102
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:21,007
OF THE SAME TIME, THERE IS FAKE

103
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:21,307
NEWS.

104
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,243
THERE IS LEGIT LEAKS.

105
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:24,844
THERE'S FAKE NEWS BECAUSE YOU

106
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:28,848
HAVE SOURCES THAT ARE UNNAMED,

107
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:29,616
UNVERIFIED, UNSUBSTANTIATED

108
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:30,350
COMING FROM THIRD-RATE PLAYERS

109
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,621
WHO HAVE AXES TO GRIND.

110
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:36,222
THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE, YOU NEVER

111
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:38,191
HAVE THIS PROBLEM.

112
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:39,926
NO ONE LEAKED BECAUSE THEY WERE

113
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:43,263
ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE PRESS.

114
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:45,298
EVERYTHING THAT CAME OUT OF THE

115
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,267
OBAMA WHITE HOUSE WAS SPUN

116
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:47,701
POSITIVELY.

117
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:51,938
>> Kimberly: THERE YOU GO, A

118
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:53,039
WATER LOG FOR YOU.

119
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,809
DAY NOW, PLEASE TRY TO MATCH

120
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:57,610
THAT.

121
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,245
>> Dana: MATCH IT?

122
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:02,849
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AIR TO SAY

123
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:03,450
THOSE THINGS.

124
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,617
>> Kimberly: MONEY.

125
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:06,653
>> Dana: WHEN I WAS THERE, I

126
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:07,487
WOULD SAVE THE WHITE HOUSE

127
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,823
COMMUNICATIONS TEAM WAS ON THE

128
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:11,591
FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER OR

129
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:13,159
LEADING "THE FIVE," I WOULD HAVE

130
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,860
BEEN MORTIFIED.

131
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,261
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE NEWS.

132
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,096
YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT TO BE THE

133
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:17,664
NEWS.

134
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:18,331
HE IS THE NEWS.

135
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:19,132
THIS IS PART OF HIM.

136
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:23,903
THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS IS

137
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:25,839
WITH THIS NEWS, THAT MUST MEAN

138
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,840
THINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD

139
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,407
ELSEWHERE.

140
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,142
WE ARE NOT LEADING WITH OTHER

141
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:29,809
DRAMATIC THINGS.

142
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,644
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

143
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:32,746
ISRAEL AND GAZA IN THE NEXT

144
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:33,046
BLOCK.

145
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:36,816
I THINK THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM.

146
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,218
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE

147
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,018
THAT IF THEY ARE TALKING TO

148
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:40,920
SOMEBODY IN THE MEDIA AND YOU

149
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,622
GET A LITTLE BIT OF A THRILL

150
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:44,257
WHEN YOU SEE YOURSELF QUOTED,

151
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:45,558
EVEN IF IT'S ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE

152
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:47,227
YOU KNOW SOMEONE THINKS YOU ARE

153
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:48,661
IMPORTANT.

154
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:49,863
THE REPORTERS KEEP GOING BACK.

155
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:51,431
THEY ARE NOT FAKE.

156
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:52,799
THEY ARE JOURNALISTS REPORTING

157
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,266
THE STORY.

158
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,234
THE PRESIDENT CALLS THEM

159
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:55,135
TRAITORS.

160
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,269
I WOULD ASSUME IN A SMALL GROUP

161
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:01,341
LIKE THE ONE THEY HAVE, THEY

162
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,243
PROBABLY KNOW WHO IT IS.

163
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:05,245
I THINK MAGGIE FROM

164
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:06,212
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" KIMONO FOR

165
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,213
TWEETS YESTERDAY WAS THAT

166
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:07,881
SOMETIMES PEOPLE COMPLAINING

167
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:09,849
MOST ABOUT THE LEAKS ARE

168
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,651
ACTUALLY THE LEAKERS.

169
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:14,120
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS GETTING

170
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,056
FIRED.

171
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:18,458
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE

172
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,893
THAT THE PERSON WHO USUALLY

173
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,661
COMPLAINS THE FIRST AND THE

174
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:24,164
LOUDEST AS THE LEAKER.

175
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:25,064
>> Kimberly: SO INTERESTING.

176
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:35,909
OR SHOULD WE SAY MUY INTERESANTE

177
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,843
OR SHOULD WE SAY MUY INTERESANT

178
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:37,243
INTERESANTE.

179
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:37,944
>> Greg: I AM NOT SURE IF IT'S

180
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:38,278
A LEAK.

181
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:39,012
I VAGUE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE

182
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,280
WORKING AT MAGAZINES AND STORIES

183
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,917
THAT GET OUT.

184
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,653
PEOPLE DON'T CALL UP A REPORTER.

185
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:47,854
THEY VENT OR THEY GO TO A BAR

186
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:52,258
AND THEY TALK LOUDLY.

187
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,027
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

188
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:56,162
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS, TO JESSE'S

189
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:56,963
POINT, THIS INTERESTING STUFF

190
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:58,264
HAS COME OUT.

191
00:05:58,264 --> 00:05:59,666
TRUMP IS THE SHOW.

192
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,633
HE IS THE SHOW.

193
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,035
PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEY TALK

194
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:03,670
ABOUT STUFF AND THEN THAT GETS

195
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,438
PICKED UP.

196
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:06,873
IT HAPPENED TO ME A LOT OF TIMES

197
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:07,707
WHEN I USED TO WORK AT

198
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:08,241
MAGAZINES.

199
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:08,942
I WOULD TELL SOMEBODY A STORY

200
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:11,444
AND IT WOULD BE IN THE MAGAZINE.

201
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:14,247
WHY DID I TELL THAT TO THAT GUY

202
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:15,548
BECAUSE HE GOT DRUNK AND THEN HE

203
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:16,783
TOLD SOMEBODY ELSE AND IT ENDS

204
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,085
UP IN PAGE SIX.

205
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,588
THAT I HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

206
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:27,126
>> Kimberly: THAT IS THE PINOT

207
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:27,527
NOIR GAME.

208
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:31,064
>> Greg: I THINK IT IS PEOPLE

209
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:33,066
VENTING AND GOSSIPING.

210
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:36,135
I DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUALLY

211
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,838
>> Dana: DON'T THINK THAT ONE

212
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,440
WAS, THE ONE ABOUT

213
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,907
SENATOR McCAIN?

214
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:41,541
>> Greg: I THINK SOMEBODY

215
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:46,613
WALKED OUT AND WAS JUST

216
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,648
DISGUSTED BY THE JOKE, WALKED

217
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:49,415
OUTSIDE, SO I CAN'T BELIEVE --

218
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,317
DIDN'T CALL A REPORTER BUT SAID

219
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,019
TO SOMEBODY ELSE, YOU WOULDN'T

220
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,121
BELIEVE WHAT THIS PERSON SAID.

221
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,823
>> Dana: THEY HAD THREE

222
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:57,156
SOURCES.

223
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:57,824
>> Kimberly: THEY PROBABLY

224
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,826
BACKED IT UP.

225
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:02,195
OBVIOUSLY HAS TO DO SOMETHING TO

226
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:02,929
MAKE SURE, THERE ARE PEOPLE

227
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,564
TALKING AND IT'S

228
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:06,799
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO A POSITIVE

229
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:10,069
WORK ENVIRONMENT, JUAN, FOR ANY

230
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:10,837
ADMINISTRATION, WHETHER IT IS

231
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:13,239
OBAMA OR CLINTON OR BUSH OR WITH

232
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:13,706
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

233
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:14,774
YOU ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON GOALS

234
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,343
AND OBJECTIVES.

235
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:20,647
THIS IS A DISTRACTION.

236
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:21,814
>> Juan: SEEMS TO ME ON SO

237
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,950
MANY LEVELS WHAT WE ARE DEALING

238
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,250
WITH.

239
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,487
TODAY IS THE FALLOUT FROM THE

240
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,054
NASTY COMMENT ABOUT

241
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:28,521
SENATOR McCAIN.

242
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,223
YOU SAY OH, MY GOD.

243
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:30,790
IT'S A LEAK.

244
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,759
IT'S TERRIBLE.

245
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,227
GUESS WHAT.

246
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:37,030
THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT

247
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,830
WAS SAID, AND THE FAILURE TO

248
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,501
APOLOGIZE PUBLICLY FOR IT, SO

249
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,336
IT'S LIKE LET'S PUT ON THE SHOWS

250
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,438
IN THE ACT AND THE MASK AND WE

251
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:46,639
WILL PRETEND THAT'S ANOTHER

252
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,440
STORY.

253
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,841
THE STORY IS THE LEAK.

254
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:49,842
THE LEAKS HAVE BEEN THERE ALL

255
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:50,243
ALONG.

256
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:53,012
I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE LEAK.

257
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:54,614
IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK I THINK

258
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,349
THAT PRESIDENT, MAYBE IT WAS

259
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,085
THIS WEEK, THINGS GO SO QUICKLY.

260
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:01,654
THE PRESIDENT WAS TWEETING ABOUT

261
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:02,488
THIS CHINESE COMPANY AND THE

262
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,923
NEGOTIATORS WHO WERE TRYING TO

263
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,892
MAKE A DEAL ON TRADE FOR CHINA.

264
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,860
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

265
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,529
WHY THOUGHT IN THE PAPERS?

266
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,632
YOU THINK ABOUT, HIS LIGHT

267
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:13,266
SCHEDULE IN THE MORNING,

268
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:16,269
EXECUTIVE TIME, THAT'S A LEAK.

269
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:16,869
GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

270
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,671
ROB PORTER, JOHN KELLY.

271
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:20,273
HOW ABOUT HIS NASTY COMMENT

272
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:22,575
ABOUT PEOPLE COMING FROM AFRICA,

273
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:24,243
THE CARIBBEAN, EL SALVADOR.

274
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,646
HOW ABOUT JUST LAST WEEK,

275
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:27,647
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN.

276
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,649
SAYING SHE WASN'T GOING TO

277
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:29,983
RESIGN.

278
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:30,850
THEN JOHN KELLY CALLED HER AND

279
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,620
ASKED HER NOT TO RESIGN.

280
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,221
>> Greg: JUAN, YOU HAVE

281
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:38,491
DRIFTED SO FAR.

282
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:39,826
>> Juan: YOU ARE THE ONE WHO

283
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:40,559
WAS OFF IN SPACE AND THIS IS

284
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,462
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

285
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:44,263
>> Greg: I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN

286
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:47,433
THAT TO ME.

287
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,369
>> Juan: THESE STORIES ABOUT

288
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,636
THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO CHANGE

289
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:51,237
THE STORY.

290
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,638
THE WHITE HOUSE DOES NOT WANT TO

291
00:08:52,638 --> 00:08:54,841
FOCUS ON WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT

292
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:55,308
SENATOR McCAIN.

293
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:58,244
THEY WANT INSTEAD TO PRETEND

294
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:00,246
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS UNDER SIEGE

295
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:00,713
BY HIS ENEMIES.

296
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:01,581
>> Greg: THAT IS WHAT I AM

297
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,850
RESPONDING TO.

298
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,552
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY I AM OFTEN

299
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:06,853
SPACE.

300
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:08,554
THE POINT, THE IMPORTANT POINT,

301
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,590
YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THE

302
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,258
ELEMENTS.

303
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:13,659
THE LEAK FROM THE LEAKING.

304
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,228
THE LEAK, A JOKE TOLD IN

305
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:17,430
PRIVATE, THAT'S A SEPARATE STORY

306
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,964
PRIVATE, THAT'S A SEPARATE STOR

307
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:18,264
STORY.

308
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:22,035
YOU CAN BE UPSET, JUAN, ABOUT

309
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:22,735
SOMETHING SAID PRIVATELY OR

310
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:24,270
OFF-CAMERA THAT ENDS UP IN THE

311
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:24,871
PRESS.

312
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,572
BECAUSE THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU

313
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,107
AND IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND IT

314
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,842
HAS HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

315
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:31,444
YOU SEE SOMETHING NEW BECOMES A

316
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:33,246
BIG STORY BECAUSE SOMEBODY

317
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:34,247
LEAKED IT.

318
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:35,448
THE POINT OF THIS STORY ISN'T

319
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:38,851
ABOUT THE ITEM ITSELF WHICH IS

320
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,019
THE JOKE.

321
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,155
IT'S ABOUT HOW SOMETHING PRIVATE

322
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,356
BECOMES A PUBLIC STORY.

323
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,892
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

324
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,293
>> Kimberly: THAT IS WHAT HE

325
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:48,194
IS UPSET ABOUT.

326
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:50,229
THE PRESIDENT IS UPSET HE CAN'T

327
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,131
SEEK PRIVATE COUNSEL OR HAVE A

328
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:53,466
PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITHOUT

329
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,467
SOMEBODY LEAKING IT.

330
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,234
ANYBODY WOULD BE FRUSTRATED

331
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:55,968
ABOUT THAT.

332
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:58,071
THAT'S THE POINT OF THE WHOLE

333
00:09:58,071 --> 00:09:58,671
SEGMENT.

334
00:09:58,671 --> 00:09:59,605
GENERAL KELLY TOOK PEOPLE'S

335
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:00,006
PHONES WAY.

336
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,674
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

337
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:03,910
DOING, HAND SIGNALS, WHATEVER.

338
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,645
THE POINT IS, STUFF IS GETTING

339
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:06,979
OUT AND IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

340
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:08,848
>> Dana: ONE OF THE REAL

341
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:11,884
DANGERS IS THAT IT DOES RUN THE

342
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,453
RISK OF CHILLING CONVERSATION SO

343
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,188
THAT IF YOU GO INTO A MEETING.

344
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:15,922
YOU ARE IN THE ROOSEVELT ROOM

345
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:17,990
AND YOU NEED TO KICK AROUND

346
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,292
IDEAS FOR POLICY TIME, YOU DON'T

347
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:20,927
WANT TO BE THE ONE WHO SAYS I'M

348
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,162
AFRAID TO SAY SOMETHING IN THIS

349
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:24,063
MEETING.

350
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:25,865
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT

351
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:29,335
LIKE THAT ABOUT SENATOR McCAIN

352
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:30,470
BUT IF YOU SAY THAT'S NOT A GOOD

353
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,238
IDEA BECAUSE OF XYZ, AND YOU ARE

354
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,873
SHOOTING THE BREEZE IN YOUR

355
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:35,241
BRAINSTORMING, AND IT GOES IN

356
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,610
THE PAPER, IT RUNS THE RISK OF

357
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,079
THE PRESIDENT NOT GETTING HIS

358
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,680
APPOINTEES' BEST ADVICE.

359
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,614
>> Greg: I WANT TO ADD TO THAT

360
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:49,021
THAT I DO THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT

361
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:49,889
CONVERSATION BEING CHILLED IS

362
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:50,256
IMPORTANT.

363
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:53,726
BUT WE HAVE TO ADMIT WE HAVE

364
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:58,030
TOLD JOKES.

365
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,866
EVERYBODY TELLS A SICK JOKE

366
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:00,433
PRIVATELY.

367
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,534
THEY MAY NOT REMEMBER THAT THEY

368
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:03,269
DID BUT THEY HAVE.

369
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,903
WE ARE SETTING A DANGEROUS

370
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:05,238
PRECEDENT.

371
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:07,573
ALL OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE ARE

372
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:07,940
TASTELESS.

373
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,741
>> Dana: WHAT'S INTERESTING IS

374
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:09,542
THAT SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM TOOK

375
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:12,445
THE JOKE.

376
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:14,280
WHATEVER IT IS THEY DON'T LIE,

377
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,448
SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM, THEY WERE

378
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:18,851
WILLING TO GO OUT AND DO THAT.

379
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:20,953
THAT'S A BIGGER INSTITUTIONAL

380
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,855
PROBLEM.

381
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:24,390
>> Greg: YOU COULD SAY THE

382
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,591
JOKE IS AWFUL.

383
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:27,160
>> Juan: IT WASN'T A JOKE.

384
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,162
>> Greg: IT WAS A BAD JOKE.

385
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:30,296
>> Juan: NOBODY EXCEPT YOU

386
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:34,634
WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS A JOKE.

387
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,068
"JUST ABOUT DEAD," NOBODY TOOK

388
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,236
IT AS A JOKE.

389
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:39,672
IT WASN'T REPORTED AS A JOKE.

390
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,240
MY POINT IS THAT WE KNOW THE

391
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,642
PRESIDENT TALKS A GREAT DEAL.

392
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:43,876
HE TALKS TO PEOPLE HERE AT

393
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,845
FOX NEWS APPARENTLY REGULARLY.

394
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:48,080
>> Greg: WHO ARE YOU REFERRING

395
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,347
TO?

396
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,415
>> Juan: I DON'T KNOW.

397
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:53,853
I CAN GO ON EITHER SIDE OF ME.

398
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:57,723
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PEOPLE IN

399
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:59,725

THAT THE PRESIDENT IS THE

402
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:04,497
BIGGEST LEAKER OF ALL BECAUSE HE

403
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:04,797
TALKS.

404
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:07,433
WHEN I AM SAYING YES WHEN YOU

406
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:09,435
CONFIDENCE.

00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,037
THESE ERIC TRUMP'S PEOPLE.

408
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,438

00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:17,410
PRESIDENT.

411
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,444
THE POOR PRESIDENT.

412
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:19,712
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.

413
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,113
>> Greg: I NEVER SAID POOR

414
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:21,480

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,650
TRANSPARENT.

417
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,618
HE LEAKS ON TWITTER.

418
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:26,552
HE TELLS EVERYBODY WHAT HE

419
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:28,454
THINKS AND WHAT IS FEELING.

420
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:29,255
HE IS THE PRESIDENT.

421
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:31,057
THE OWNER AND THE KEEPER OF THE

422
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,892
INFORMATION, SO IF HE WANTS TO

423
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:34,794
TALK TO A REPORTER, MAGGIE

424
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:35,861
HABERMAN OR SOMEBODY,

427
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:42,468
THIS IS HOW HE OPERATES.

428
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:44,136
>> Juan: A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

429
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,471
THERE NEEDS TO BE A HISTORICAL

430
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:47,373
RECORD GAP BECAUSE THINGS ARE SO

431
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:49,308
STRANGE RIGHT NOW IN THE

433
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,078
>> Kimberly: THERE SHOULD BE A

434
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:53,813
RECORD BECAUSE IT'S STRANGE?

435
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:54,614
>> Juan: PEOPLE WANT THE

436
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:56,182
HISTORICAL RECORD TO BE CLEAR.

437
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,451
IT'S LIKE THE PHONE CALL WITH

438
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,885
THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER.

439
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:00,319
NO PROBLEM.

440
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,988

441
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:02,888
AND SOMEBODY LEAKED IT BECAUSE

00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,156
THEY WANT OF THE WORLD TO KNOW

00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:06,659
THIS IS THE WAY HE TALKS TO OUR

444
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:07,059
