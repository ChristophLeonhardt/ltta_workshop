THE WHOLE THING IS BAD. THERE’S NO WAY TO FIX IT

117
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:16,431
THERE’S NO WAY TO FIX IT COMPLETELY BECAUSE THE CHILDREN

118
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,432
COMPLETELY BECAUSE THE CHILDREN ARE SO TRAUMATIZED.

119
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,867
ARE SO TRAUMATIZED. THE FAMILIES -- THESE CHILDREN

120

SOME OF THEM, BECAUSE THEY’RE LIKE, YOU ABANDONED ME.

128
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,046
LIKE, YOU ABANDONED ME. IT’S HARD FOR A CHILD TO

129
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:31,546
IT’S HARD FOR A CHILD TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

130
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:33,882
UNDERSTAND THAT. I SPOKE WITH A MOM IN HOUSTON

SAID TOMORROW, YOU SAID THE DAY AFTER, WHERE ARE YOU?

137
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:48,463
AFTER, WHERE ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU NOT TRYING HARD

138
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:48,797
WHY ARE YOU NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH?

139
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:52,100
ENOUGH? IT’S LIKE A PLOT OUT OF "THE

WHAT THAT DOES TO A CHILD AS WELL.

146
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:02,410
WELL. MANY THAT WERE HELD WITHTHY

00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:04,780
MANY THAT WERE HELD WITHTHY PARENTS STILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME

00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,180
PARENTS STILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME VERBALIZING.

149
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,682
VERBALIZING. I’VE HAD TO STOP INTERVIEWS COLD

150
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:08,917
I’VE HAD TO STOP INTERVIEWS COLD BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TOUGH TIME

151
00:04:08,952 --> 00:04:13,955
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TOUGH TIME DESCRIBING THE MYLAR BLANKETS,

00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,090
DESCRIBING THE MYLAR BLANKETS, THE CAGES, HAVING PEOPLE SPEAK

WEBS A LOT. THESE UNDER-5 CHILDREN, DOES

00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:23,899
THESE UNDER-5 CHILDREN, DOES THAT MEAN IF THE PARENTS

159
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,134
THAT MEAN IF THE PARENTS INADVERTENTLY GAVE UP THEIR

160
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,335
INADVERTENTLY GAVE UP THEIR RIGHTS, THESE CHILDREN COULD BE

161
