Gerald Butz was with Trudeau in Chicago and obviously the people kind thing was coming up everywhere because it's everywhere in American media too not just on right-wing FoxNews and Gerald Butz just couldn't control himself he could control the CBC he got their comedy department to shut up about it he got the news department to say the whole thing was a right-wing plot he got their investigative journalists to investigate and find out that yes and need people kindness a real word people he got everything under control except his own temper so this morning after all the dust had settled after whole fiasco was over Butz just lost his cool here's what he tweeted the lesson to take from this joke being torqued by in force and other alt-right nazi friends of the rebel is there paying attention game on team Trudeau holy cow so it's the Nazis that are making fun of Trudeau the Nazis you know there's this thing called Godwin's law have you ever heard of it it's like Murphy's Law is Godwin's law and it's a good rule of thumb and it says the first person who calls the other guy Hitler loses the argument I mean if that's all you've got and yeah that is all geryl butts and Trudeau's PMO has calling their critics Nazis critics like the BBC like the Washington Post how pitiful how extreme how intemperate here's how one of the accused knocks Nazis replied Piers Morgan he said a I'm not a Nazi v it wasn't a joke see if you're one of Justin Trudeau's chief advisors no wonder he's making so many gaffes wow that's a bull's-eye well said and better journalism and criticism by a UK journalist than by any Canadian mainstream media journalist so you think Piers Morgan has his flaws but he knows how to fight and he knows how to make headlines Justin Trudeau's principal secretary just ensured that this story will go on for at least another day or two and now it's personal for everyone like Piers Morgan who feels like they were called a Nazi just for laughing at precious Prince Justin now they were being attacked it's telling isn't it how Canadian journalists take their licks and stay down when Gerald butts rages at journalists it's refreshing to see a journalist like Piers Morgan not bow down at rude overbites I'd almost forgot what that looked like that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra lavance show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
