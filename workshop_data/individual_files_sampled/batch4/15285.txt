when I think of Texas I typically think of the heartland of American values of free speech gun rights and all the rest of it I certainly never would have imagined that this state would be a hotbed of an T for a decay is 'm but wait until you see this let me introduce you to Revolutionary horizon a student group at the University of Texas at San Antonio Wow look at that digitally designed graffiti art they must be really edgy the group builds itself is anti-fascist anti-racist anti-sexist and explicitly states that it's trying to build a revolt against capitalism now a lot of these antiva groups are very active on social media and revolutionary horizon is no exception saying in light of the increasing severity of immigration and customs enforcement presence in the san antonio community were working with trusted radicals in the community to implement a text alert eye swatch text SAT x16 one two eight four four eight three to sign up to receive alerts anytime ice is spotted in our community then there's that clever little flier saying no one is illegal don't you just love how the left tries to twist language you can't call someone in legal because no human being can be illegal yeah I'm not calling her humanity illegal smarty just your presence in my country but that apparently doesn't matter to these kids here's what they do with ice flyers the group tells me that their alert system is active and they're just trying to let people know they do still have to integrate what they call the horizontal community-driven aspect to the system that allows for anyone already signed up to receive alerts to be able to send alerts of their own through the system when they spot ice in their area but hey they're pretty woke I'm sure they'll figure it out in no time in fact Revolutionary Horizon is so woke they want the UT San Antonio police to lay their weapons down and disband over the course of six months and these commies aren't an anomaly I reported before on the revolutionary student front at UT Austin which said bricks belong best thrown at pig heads this same group has also hosted self-defense courses and a revolutionary mental health program to address the mental health needs of students in a way that would primarily serve to politicize and strengthen them to become more committed to revolution and more capable of carrying it out uh-huh I would think that taking advantage of the mentally disabled might be able to borrow from the left vocabulary but perhaps it's okay if it's done to transform them into weapons against capitalism for campus unmasked i'm rob shamrock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm
