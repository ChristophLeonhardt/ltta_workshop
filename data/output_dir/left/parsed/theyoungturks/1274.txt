MICHAEL BLOOMBERG WAS THE
FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY,
ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN LIVE,
HE HAS BEEN A DEMOCRAT, A
REPUBLICAN, AN INDEPENDENT, NOW
HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND ON WHICH
WAY HE WILL GO IN THESE
ELECTIONS IN 2018 AND HE'S
COMING IN WITH A BOATLOAD OF
MONEY, SO THIS COULD MAKE A HUGE
IMPACT. HUFFPOST REPORTS --
OOOH, REPUBLICANS, YOU DON'T
LIKE THAT, RIGHT? I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS GUY IS COMING IN
HERE WITH ALL THIS BIG MONEY IN
POLITICS. WE WILL COME BACK TO
THAT, HERE IS PART OF HIS
ANNOUNCEMENT ON TWITTER,
BLOOMBERG 
SAYS --
IN HIS FULL STATEMENT HE WENT
ON TO STATE WHY, HE SAID, AND
REMEMBER, HE IS A FORMER
REPUBLICAN --
NOW, BLOOMBERG IS KNOWN FOR
SEVERAL THINGS, PROBABLY MOST
FAMOUSLY AT LEAST FROM A
RIGHT-WING PERSPECTIVE IS HIS
STANCE AGAINST GUNS. HE WANTS
GUN CONTROL. SO HERE COMES $80
MILLION TO COUNTER THE NRA AND
OTHERS ON THE ISSUE OF GUN
CONTROL. WHAT HAPPENED,
CONSERVATIVES? I THOUGHT YOU
LIKED MONEY IN POLITICS? THE
REALITY IS OF COURSE IF YOU ARE
A CONSERVATIVE OUT THERE YOU ARE
SAYING NO I DON'T, CENK, THAT'S
UNFAIR, I HATE THE CORRUPTION, I
HATE OUR POLITICIANS WHO TAKE
THAT MONEY AND I DON'T WANT
BLOOMBERG COMING IN AND SPENDING
THAT MONEY ON THESE ELECTIONS,
ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES I DON'T
AGREE WITH. BUT HEY, WHY YOU
KEEP VOTING FOR POLITICIANS THAT
DO THAT? BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN
POLITICIANS, EN MASSE, GENERALLY
SPEAKING -- NOT ALWAYS AT THE
STATE LEVEL, TO BE FAIR AT THE
STATE LEVEL THERE ARE SOME
HONEST, PRINCIPLED REPUBLICAN
POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS --
BUT AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THEY
ARE ALMOST ALL FOR MONEY AND
POLITICS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
THIS WILL BE FUN, WE WILL GET
MONEY FROM THE KOCH BROTHERS AND
SHELDON ADELSON AND
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND
WE WILL JUST KEEP TAKING THAT
MONEY. NOW THERE IS MONEY ON THE
OTHER SIDE, ALL OF A SUDDEN
THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE. I HAVE A
VERY CLEAR STANCE ON THAT WHICH
I WILL GET TO IN A SECOND. NOW,
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN BLOOMBERG PUT
IN IF HE REALLY WANTED TO? WELL,
HIS NET WORTH IS $51 BILLION.
NOT MILLION, BILLION. SO IF YOU
PUT IN $2 BILLION TO AN ELECTION
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD FEEL IT,
I DON'T THINK IT'S CLOSE, HE
WOULDN'T MISS IT. I MEAN, YOU
ARE SAYING THAT'S CRAZY, CENK,
HE CAN'T PUT $2 BILLION INTO AN
ELECTION. YES HE CAN. WE HAVE
LEGALIZED BRIBERY IN THIS
COUNTRY, HE CAN PUT AS MUCH
MONEY AS HE WANTS INTO AN
ELECTION. THERE ARE LIMITS ON
HOW MUCH YOU CAN GIVE TO AN
INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE BUT THOSE
ARE A JOKE BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST
DO INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES, YOU
CAN SET UP SUPER PACS, DARK
MONEY, AT LEAST BLOOMBERG HAS
THE DECENCY TO SAY A PUBLIC AND
HE'S NOT HIDING IT, HE SAYS I'M
COMING FOR YOU. AM I A BIG
PROPONENT OF BLOOMBERG'S MONEY?
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T AGREE WITH
HIM ON, HE IS IN NORMA'S
ADVOCATE OF WALL STREET, I DON'T
AGREE WITH HIM ON THAT, HE DID
STOP AND FRISK IN NEW YORK, I
DON'T AGREE ON THAT. MOST
IMPORTANTLY, I DON'T THINK THAT
A SINGLE PERSON SHOULD BE
BUYING/BRIBING OUR POLITICIANS.
CALL ME CRAZY. WELL, THEN YOU
WOULD HAVE TO CALL 93% OF THE
COUNTRY CRAZY BECAUSE WE ALL
THINK THAT. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO
DISAGREE WITH US ARE THE
POLITICIANS. SO ONE MORE QUOTE
HERE FROM HUFFPOST ABOUT
BLOOMBERG --
THAT'S WHERE REPUBLICANS
MIGHT HOWL EVEN MORE. IF YOU ARE
A SECOND AMENDMENT SUPPORTER
REPUBLICAN, NOW HE'S GOING TO
BUY OFF REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS
TOO. YEP. THEY CAN BUY ANYTHING
THEY WANT. IT IS AN OPEN
AUCTION, WE DON'T HAVE A
DEMOCRACY, WE HAVE AN OLIGARCHY
WHERE BLOOMBERG AND THE KOCH
BROTHERS ARE IN A BATTLE OVER
WHO IS GOING TO BRIBE
POLITICIANS MORE. IT'S INSANITY.
SO DO I WANT BLOOMBERG DOING
THIS IN THIS CURRENT
ENVIRONMENT? GOOD. GOOD. WHAT,
YOU THINK I WANT UNILATERAL
DISARMAMENT? NO, IF THE NRA IS
GOING TO PUT IN $80 MILLION INTO
AN ELECTION I HOPE BLOOMBERG
PUTS IN $80 MILLION. IF THE KOCH
BROTHERS AND ADELSON ARE GOING
TO DO IT, I HOPE SOROS AND
BLOOMBERG DO IT TOO. AND I HOPE
MOST OF ALL IT MAKES YOU REALIZE
BRIBERY IS BAD NO MATTER WHO IS
DOING IT OR WHICH SIDE. SO IN
THE END WHEN I SAY GET MONEY OUT
OF POLITICS DO I ALSO MEAN
BLOOMBERG'S MONEY? GOD DAMN
RIGHT I DO. OF COURSE WE SHOULD
GET BLOOMBERG'S MONEY OUT OF
POLITICS, AND ADELSON'S, AND THE
KOCH BROTHERS', AND
CORPORATIONS, AND UNIONS, WE
HAVE TO STOP ALL THE MONEY FROM
GOING INTO POLITICS. IF PRIVATE
INTERESTS FINANCE OUR ELECTIONS,
OUR POLITICIANS WILL WORK FOR
PRIVATE INTERESTS. SO THAT'S WHY
YOU NEED PUBLIC FINANCING SO
THEY WORK FOR THE PUBLIC, IT'S A
PURE MATTER OF LOGIC. OH, PUBLIC
FINANCING WOULD COST US A LOT OF
MONEY -- ARE YOU CRAZY? THOSE
TAX CUTS COST US TRILLIONS,
BECAUSE ALL THE POLITICIANS GOT
BRIBED INTO SUPPORTING THE TAX
CUTS FOR THE RICH. THE TOP 1% ON
AVERAGE GET $61,000 PER YEAR,
EVERY YEAR, FROM JUST THOSE ONE
SET OF TAX CUTS, LET ALONE THE
TAX CUTS THAT GO TO
CORPORATIONS, ETC. SO I WANT ALL
THE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS, I
WANT THE PRIVATE FINANCING OF
OUR ELECTIONS TO END BECAUSE IT
LEADS TO ENDLESS CORRUPTION. SO
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IN AN
ACTUAL, BIPARTISAN WAY, AND THE
GOOD NEWS IS DEMOCRATIC AND
REPUBLICAN VOTERS AGREE, WE HATE
THE CORRUPTION, 93% OF THE
COUNTRY SAYS THAT THERE
POLITICIANS REPRESENT THEIR
DONORS AND NOT THE VOTERS, AND
THEY ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. SO WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
WOLF-PAC.COM, THAT IS TO GET THE
MONEY OUT, TO GET IT ALL OUT,
THEY ARE NONPARTISAN. IF YOU ARE
A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN AND YOU
WANT TO GET MONEY OUT OF
POLITICS THEY WILL SUPPORT YOU
WHOLEHEARTEDLY, THEY ARE DOING
IT RIGHT NOW WITH THE CANDIDATE
IN MARYLAND AS WE SPEAK, THEY
WILL DO IT AGAIN SOON WHETHER
IT'S DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, IF
YOU ARE AGAINST THAT IDEA, YOU
WANT TO KEEP MONEY IN POLITICS,
THEN WOLFPAC WILL COME FOR YOU.
YOU GOT MONEY IN POLITICS, SOME
OF THE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS AT
THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARE ECSTATIC,
GIDDY, ABOUT THEIR SUGAR
DADDIES, IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE
OTHER PEOPLE WITH MONEY AS WELL,
AND THEY CAN ALSO COME FOR YOU.
HOW ABOUT WE GO BACK TO A
DEMOCRACY THAT ACTUALLY
REPRESENT THE VOTERS?
