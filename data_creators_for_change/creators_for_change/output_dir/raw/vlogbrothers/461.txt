1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,089
Ugghhh.

2
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:02,350
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,910
It's morning, but I still see the moon and
that star that you're probably gonna tell

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,760
me tomorrow is actually a planet.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,930
Alright, it's a little bit later and I'm in
a better mood now.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,170
Plus I'm vlogging from the car; that always
makes me happy.

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,840
So Hank, I really enjoyed your history of
the Pizza John design, but it made me wonder

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,890
about the history of pizza, and also the history
of Johns.

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,550
We're gonna start with the history of pizza,
but first we have to define what we mean when

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,650
we talk about pizza.

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,300
I mean, we live in an age of cheeseless pizza,
and sauceless pizza, and none pizza with left

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
beef.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,040
Now some people say that pizza is just like
bread with toppings, and so they trace it

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,100
back to Ancient Egypt and India and Greece.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,350
But Hank, I think we all know that those people
are wrong, I mean garlic naan is not pizza.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,829
Banana bread is not pizza.

17
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:47,690
Pizza is bread and tomato sauce and cheese
and possibly other.

18
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,670
And by that definition, the history of pizza
becomes a lot more interesting, because for

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,920
almost all of human history, pizza was impossible.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,140
Pizza's central ingredients lived in entirely
different worlds, Hank.

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,320
In the Americas, there were delicious tomatoes.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,489
And in the rest of the world, there was wonderful
cows' milk and bread.

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,890
But then, Christopher Columbus.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,529
Now, Hank, as discussed in this video - and
you will notice my excellent pointing skills.

25
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,030
Anyway, the exchange between the Americas
and the rest of the world that began with

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,249
Columbus, in the late fifteenth century, was
disastrous for life on Earth in many, many

27
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,249
ways.

28
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:23,969
But it did make pizza possible, and also like
90% of the foods that we now eat.

29
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,920
I mean, hamburgers and french fries?

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,759
There were no cows in the New World, no potatoes
in the Old World.

31
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,369
I mean, can you imagine going to a restaurant
and being like, "hey, can I have a hamburger

32
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:34,469
and French fries?", and them being like, "Well,
you can have french fries, but if you want

33
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,210
the hamburger ,you're gonna have to leave
the Americas".

34
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,759
Well, among the many New World foods that
came to the Old World was tomatoes, which

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,159
was initially believed to be poisonous, but
it turns out that they are just dangerously

36
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,159
delicious.

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,829
And by the middle of the sixteenth century,
in Naples, Italy, we had pizza as we know

38
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,219
it today, with cheese, and tomato sauce, and
bread and possibly other.

39
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,889
But like most things, Hank, pizza didn't actually
have an inventor, it had, like, millions of

40
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:56,889
innovators.

41
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,859
Like, for instance, the pizza in sixteenth
century Naples tasted very little like pizza

42
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:00,859
as we know it today.

43
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,740
For one thing, it was sweet, like pizza literally
means 'pie'.

44
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,469
So the story of pizza is really a story of,
like, humans coming together over thousands

45
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,120
of generations and across continents to invent
the perfect food.

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,791
And that's what history is, really, Hank,
it's not really about great individuals, it's

47
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:21,459
this ongoing collaboration among the ninety
six billion or so people who have lived here.

48
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,459
Alright, Johns!

49
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,930
John comes from the Hebrew name meaning 'God
is gracious', and for, like, a thousand years

50
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,310
it was the most popular name in England, until,
like, I was born and then suddenly it became

51
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,310
less popular.

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,719
I'm trying not to take that personally.

53
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,310
There's a few minor Johns in the Hebrew Bible,
but the Johns really took off in the New Testament.

54
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,069
I don't want to brag, Hank, but there are
no Hanks in the New Testament, and there's

55
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,689
some pretty vital Johns.

56
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,510
Like, there's the itinerant preacher John
the Baptist, Jesus' apostle John...

57
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,930
Historians disagree about whether there are
other Johns in the Bible, and I'm going to

58
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,430
steer clear of that argument because I'm no
dummy!

59
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,980
But anyway Hank, the most interesting thing
I learned in my research is that the name

60
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,010
John is not the same name as the name Jonathan.

61
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,700
Jonathan comes from a different Hebrew word
that means 'gift from God', and it's a longer

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,909
form not of John, but of Nathan.

63
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,150
So there you have it Hank, a brief history
of pizza and Johns.

64
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,370
It happens to be lunchtime.

65
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,790
You'll never guess what I'm having.

66
00:03:10,790 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, I'll see you tomorrow.
