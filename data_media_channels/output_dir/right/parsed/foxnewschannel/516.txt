SHE WILL BE BACK WHEN THE
HEARING RESUMES ABOUT 10 MINUTES
FROM NOW.
>> Martha: WE ARE TOLD
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN
WATCHING CLOSELY.
THAT U.N. MEETINGS HE WAS
RESIGNING OVER, JOHN ROBERTS
JOINS US FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT
THE REACTION OR THE MOOD OVER
THERE?
>> RIGHT NOW THE MOOD IS WAIT
AND SEE.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT CAME BACK
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT AN
HOUR AGO AND WENT INTO THE
RESIDENCE, HE HAD BEEN WATCHING
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE.
I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHICH MEANS
HE COULD STILL BE UP IN THE
RESIDENCE WATCHING.
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE
PRESIDENT'S IS DOING AT THIS
PARTICULAR MOMENT.
THERE WERE SOME REPORTS THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS RAGING ABOUT THE
TESTIMONY, I'M TOLD THAT'S NOT
TRUE.
HIS REACTION TO WHAT HE'S BEEN
SEEING, IT WAS NOT
CHARACTERIZED.
THE PERSON I TALKED TO SAID WE
WILL WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE
DAY UNTIL WE COMMENT.
I GET A SENSE THAT THE PEOPLE
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE
MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AS WELL AS
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN
THE CONFIRMATION PROCEEDINGS OF
BRETT KAVANAUGH ARE LOOKING AT
THIS AS AN EMOTION VERSUS FACT
TYPE OF SCENARIO, THAT THERE ARE
A LOT OF GAPS IN HER
RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED
BACK IN AND AROUND 1982.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE IS VERY
EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT AND ONE
PERSON I TALKED TO HERE AT THE
WHITE HOUSE DESCRIBED HER AS A
VERY CREDIBLE WITNESS.
THEY KNOW THAT SOME DAMAGE IS
BEING DONE TO THEIR NOMINEE
RIGHT NOW AND IT REALLY WILL BE
UP TO BRETT KAVANAUGH TO PUSH
BACK IN A COMPELLING WAY AGAINST
WHAT IS BEING SAID THIS MORNING.
WHAT IS GOING TO GET DOWN TO IS
WHAT MANY OF YOUR ANALYSTS HAVE
BEEN SAYING THIS MORNING, 11
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO DECIDE
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO VOTE
FOR THIS NOMINEE BECAUSE YOU
ALREADY HAVE TEN DEMOCRATS WHO
HAVE DECIDED THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
I THINK AT THIS POINT THE JURY
IS OUT ON HOW THIS IS GOING.
THEY CLEARLY THINK THAT SHE HAS
BEEN A CREDIBLE WITNESS FOR THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND NOW
LET'S SEE AFTER SHE FINISHES UP
WHAT BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS TO SAY
WHEN THEY COME BACK ON THE OTHER
SIDE.
>> Bret: THERE'S ANOTHER EVENT
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN TODAY THAT
WAS GOING TO BE BIG NEWS TODAY
AND THAT IS THE PRESIDENT
MEETING WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN, THE
PRESIDENT TWEETING OUT...
OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A CHOICE TO
PUT THE FOCUS BACK ON BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
>> WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER THIS
WEEK AFTER THE WHOLE KERFUFFLE
ON WHETHER ROSENSTEIN WAS GOING
TO GET FIRED ON MONDAY, THE
PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO MEET ON
THURSDAY, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
ELSE THE PRESIDENT PROBABLY
WANTS TO PAY ATTENTION TO ON
THURSDAY?
THE PRESIDENT DID TALK TO
ROSENSTEIN, EITHER JUST BEFORE
HE LEFT NEW YORK OR ON THE WAY
HERE AND SAID LET'S PUSH IT OFF
UNTIL NEXT WEEK, THERE'S TOO
MUCH GOING ON.
THE SENSE WE GOT YESTERDAY WAS
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, ROSENSTEIN
MAY KEEP HIS JOB.
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT'S NOT HIS
PREFERENCE TO FIRE HIM.
I THINK WITH THE PRESIDENT WANTS
TO DO IS HAVE A GOOD, LONG CHAT
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS GOING ON
LAST YEAR.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" STORY THAT
WAS OUT LAST WEEK SAID
ROSENSTEIN WAS TRYING TO GET
SUPPORT FOR THE 20 FOR THE
AMENDMENT REMOVAL OF THE
PRESIDENT, GOING SO FAR AS TO
WHERE A WIRE TO GET EVIDENCE ON
HIM.
BY THE WAY, WE DID FIND OUT AS
WELL THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT WE
DIDN'T TO KAVANAUGH THIS MORNING
