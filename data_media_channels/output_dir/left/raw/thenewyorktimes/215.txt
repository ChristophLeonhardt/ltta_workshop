1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,310
This is what’s left of
the city of Marawi

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,240
in the southern Philippines.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,460
A homegrown extremist
group loyal to ISIS

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,760
seized the city
about a year ago.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,100
The result was the
longest urban combat

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,770
in the country
since World War II.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,310
At least 350,000
people were displaced,

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,200
including the Magindiri family.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,670
When they heard the first shots,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,820
this family of six packed up
the car with the few belongings

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,800
they could grab and escaped
to a neighboring city.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,030
Today is their first day
back home.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,670
Across Marawi most
houses look like this,

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,460
or much worse.

15
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,530
It all started when a group
of about 900 pro-ISIS fighters

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,980
stormed this 
majority-Muslim city last May.

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,989
For five months,
the Philippine army,

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,170
with help from the
United States, pushed back.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,940
They attacked with airstrikes
and close-fought urban combat.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,330
In October, Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte declared

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,990
Marawi liberated.

22
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,715
And just last month,

23
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:27,640
the city was reopened
for residents to come in —

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,560
but only to see their homes,
recover what they can

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,830
and then leave again.

26
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,530
No one was allowed to stay
because large parts

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,770
of the city were still unsafe.

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,000
Bomb-removal squads
made up mostly of volunteers

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,300
were using flashlights
on their phones.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,160
Only a few areas
had been checked

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,190
for unexploded ordnance.

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,020
And here people came home

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,440
to unidentified skeletal remains.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,190
According to the
Philippine government,

35
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,330
at least 900 militants
and around 168 soldiers

36
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,040
were killed here.

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,660
Most of the city’s residents
had fled and survived.

38
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,960
Across the city,

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,310
we met families who were
stunned by the destruction.

40
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,207
Haydee Dimalawang had not
seen her home in 10 months.

41
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,830
"This is our vault."

42
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,130
"What was inside the vault?"

43
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,820
"That's money, now nothing. 
It's water."

44
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,820
Reconstruction
will take years.

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,300
But Chinese contractors
are already rushing in

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,260
with bids to rebuild.

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,180
And President Duterte
has shown interest

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,900
in what China has to offer.

49
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,860
This cozying up,

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,070
experts say, points to
China’s growing influence

51
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,700
in a country that has
been a traditional

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,155
U.S. ally in the region.

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,410
While governments
around the world

54
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,760
hail the defeat
of ISIS,

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,970
for the people here 
who have lost their homes

56
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,760
the fight is not finished.

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,760
When they’ll be able to return,

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:00:00,000
no one really knows.
