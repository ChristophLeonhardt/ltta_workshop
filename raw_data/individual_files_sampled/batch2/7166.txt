the students who are holding politicians accountable for doing very little in regard to mass shootings in the United States are not letting up in fact they are speaking out against politicians like Donald Trump Marco Rubio and more and the recent examples have to do with Trump meeting with some of these victims and essentially needing a notecard to tell him how to be decent to the victims so that's the notorious note card that went viral recently basically tells the president to communicate to these students that he hears them because it's something that he can't remember on his own but I want to give you some of his strategy when it comes to dealing with these students and how much it's how much it kind of deviates from the way he usually deals with situations so Trump has said he believes that understanding and channeling the nation's grief is a strong suit for him as president assuring a reporter during his campaign that empathy quote will be one of the strongest things about Trump okay all right I'm sorry let's pause there for saying look I I don't know if we overemphasize the under emphasize it but what a preposterous ly insane thing to say embassy will be one of the strongest things about Trump can you imagine if any person in your life talk like that like you're talking to someone then they say Oh embassy is gonna be one of the strongest things about Uecker but who am I talking to what's what kind of lunatic talks like that that that empathy has to be one of your strong suits it'll be one of your strongest suits and he says that of course always to overcompensate I'm a very stable genius in other words he's unstable and knows what an idiot is right and I mean I know using you're talking about yourself on a third person some people hate that and that okay but sometimes it makes sense is said but referring to your last name it's so weird it's so weird if I went around going I'll tell you something about euchre what's wrong with this guy all right you know he just tells it like it is by the way was he empathetic when he ended protections for dreamers or when reported non-criminal undocumented immigrants who have been in the country since they were kids the people who were business owners who had children and owned homes in the United States was he empathetic toward the accusers who said that Roy Moore had sexually assaulted them or molested them I'm not very empathetic I don't know he also said I I just grieve for you I feel so it's just to me there could be nothing worse than what you've gone through so those are some of the things that he said to the students and to be fair again he's deviating from the way that he typically communicates with people which is good these are victims and and they should be treated differently from how Trump usually treats people I mean thank God if he bullied that maybe that last quote there's nothing wrong nothing wrong with it now the students aren't buying it though and I want to give you a few examples of some of these victims who have stood up to Trump following some of his statements Samantha Fuentes who was shot in both legs during the parkland assault said she had felt no reassurance during a phone call that she had with Trump he said he heard that I was a big fan of his and then he said I'm a big fan of yours too I'm pretty sure he made that up talking to the president I've never been so unimpressed by a person in my life he didn't make me feel better in the slightest Flint has also said Trump had called the gunman a sick puppy and said oh boy oh boy oh boy like seven times he's he's not prepared for these calls because he doesn't want to make the calls it's doing his homework that's why he doesn't remember people's names often and by the week staffers write it down and put it one by one on in a card in front of him because he's obviously a child you just got to get him to focus so it's his incompetent staff as well but to me there was like there were there was a parent who really liked interacting with trauma thought he was a great guy so look and a little bit of guys who people who didn't already like Trump came away thinking he was terrible right people who liked Trump came away thinking he was okay except for this woman she did like Trump and then she was like Jesus what was that right so maybe that's the most reflective right one thing that sticks out to me here is I mean the fact that he had the words I hear you written down I think combined with that example of a very inauthentic conversation with students stands for this larger proposition I really don't see a report anywhere which is just how inhuman he is you know Obama would have been talking about his kids immediately right if he was talking the kids would have been like when I look into your eyes when I see you shot I think of my kids and what would how I would feel and there was never I mean at can you name one moment of even referring to his own family anywhere on his presidency you know it's a humanizing yeah I hear what you're saying and by the way do you hear me or do you hear me I don't know what make sure it's for real okay no but I always be honest and say thank you for hearing me respond sorry Jake to your point about Obama you're right Obama would mention his kids as he did when unarmed black kids were being shot and killed and he said that he would think about his own children or he would say that it you know it's a kid that looked like him and what happened on the Republican side when he would make those statements he got attacked for it yeah I remember when he said it about Trayvon they went nuts they're like how dare you humanize them you know I don't know if they know this but conservatives and liberals Republicans and Democrats are all human and it would be nice if the president could show sympathy whether they were a big fan of his or not a big fan of his and can you imagine if Obama at any tragedy like kept on asking for credit as Trump did in Puerto Rico and Houston and Florida like where's my credit I did a great job with this if Obama had done that oh my god but I mean it's over and over again with Donald Trump doing outrageous things that no president has ever done and and he he struggles with empathy because he is so self-centered that if he's trying to do empathy and heat in this case botched or not I think he is trying empathy for them maybe the first time but he's got to try really hard cuz he doesn't have it in him so I want you to hear from another Sam's life he's an eighteen year old student at Stoneman Douglas high he said mr. Trump had done little to comfort or console him take a look at this next video where he mentions Trump's card did you get some sense that you were heard and that you've been heard in this this whole matter is there some sense that there will be some work to fix what happened last week well I know I was heard because I saw it on Trump's little car today I hear you but I don't think I was felt these kids are strong it's pretty amazing and it's leading to real change you now have lawmakers in Florida who are proposing legislation that would limit some gun rights and these are the types of laws that they would have never considered before and it's because these teenagers are not just calling them out they're hitting them where it hurts they're talking about the corruption they're talking about the NRA they are not buying into this idea that the NRA is there to protect your Second Amendment they know about how the money works they know about weapons manufacturers they're smart kids we're very well aware and I love that they're approving all of these naysayers who belittle them and minimize them as people who don't know anything I love that they're proving them wrong yes so two things about that a lot of the Republicans are going around saying I am George Soros put them up - right and it's because it's projection whenever they don't have a thought in their heads Republican politicians they only do whatever their donors told them to do sometimes is the NRA some the Koch brothers mercer's etc so they naturally assume while those kids look like they got talking points or something because you know because they're dumb and they're they be like I don't know what to say unless somebody gives me a talking point and they those kids look smart some somebody must have given them a talking point who wouldn't for me it's always a rich donor so who is it for the kids it must be George Soros how the world with George Soros have gotten down to Florida giving those kids talking points I mean you have to be a lunatic to believe that for those kids but they can't imagine that those kids on their own would have enough you know gumption courage and intelligence to to put these ideas forward and to fight back and unfortunately I think the Democratic Party is so bad at fighting back that this is like the first resistance the Republicans have ever gotten they're like whoa what is this yeah that's a good point I didn't think about it in those terms but there's certainly a lot more powerful than what we're seeing from our elected officials on the Democratic side no doubt thinking for the last year that if we survive this moment which I think we will that one silver lining in retrospect will be just the Civic awakening that is happened in this country and the new people have gotten involved in the process and this just seems like one big layer on that cake like people young people not just getting involved but using their unique strengths as Millennials to participate in the political process so there's these apps out there now where it's like oh you type in your zip code and you get the NRA donations of every person who represents you I and and kids are texting that to each other as opposed to making plans to go to the movies right so it's like wow like like they have awoken a sleeping giant and a set of tools that frankly people our age probably wouldn't be able to use as much and it's just inspiring to think about how big the impact might be come November absolutely and it always amazes me that this is this is not some progressive school in California this is Florida yeah and even though they're in one of the most conservative states when it comes to gun laws especially these kids are not being you know brainwashed by that culture they know that there needs to be some controls and they're fighting back even even in the state of Florida that's the thing that gives me hope the most one last piece of almost unbearable hypocrisy this note was actually sent to me by one of our viewers he said so a lot of Republicans argued that Roy Moore's 14-year old and 16 year old victims were adults enough to give consent they're like no they were they were fine with it day they were those 14 year olds knew what they were doing now when you got 17 and 18 year olds out there saying yeah I know what I'm doing I don't want to get shot in a school and I saw my friends now how would they know they can't they can't think for themselves how do you like that for hypocrisy if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me DUI tea network.com slash joy
