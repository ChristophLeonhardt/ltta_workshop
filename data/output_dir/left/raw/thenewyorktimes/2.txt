1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,640
“Hello and welcome to
‘Internetting After Dark.’

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,575
If you don’t know
by now, I’m Amanda.”

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:05,280
“I’m Shane.”

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,950
“And we’re here to give you a
closer look inside the making

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,105
of ‘Internetting.’”

6
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:12,885
“And this is our season finale
of ‘Internetting After Dark.’”

7
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:15,790
“And after this, I never have
to wear this sweater again.

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,090
So should we get started?”

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,510
“Let’s do it.”

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,370
“One of the videos we
made was about babies,

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,440
and how it’s like
pretty horrifying how

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,630
some parents take
videos of them

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,165
and put them here. From
All Things Fascinating:”

14
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:30,540
“‘I feel the same way for cute
kitten and cute dog videos.

15
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,120
I really can’t put my finger
on what’s wrong about them,

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,972
but after watching too many of
them, I just feel depressed.’”

17
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:37,800
“It’s a similar
sensation to watching

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,400
a baby fail, where you know
that the subject of the video

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,440
can’t consent.

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,821
I’m just thinking about
how funny they are.”

21
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:49,070
“Well, that’s the thing,
though, they’re super joyful.

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,630
I say that if you
watch too many of them,

23
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,860
you feel depressed
in the same way

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,330
that if you eat too
much birthday cake,

25
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,170
you feel depressed.

26
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,640
In any event, inspired by
these animal prank videos,

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,068
I did videotape a
prank of Wanda.”

28
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:02,935
“You pranked Wanda?”

29
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:28,847
“I don’t know that
you did it right.”

30
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:33,220
“I don’t think I
did it right either.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,945
So I didn’t have a cucumber.”

32
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,685
“So we also made a
video about drag.”

33
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:39,070
“And we got some really
great and very thoughtful

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,205
YouTube comments.

35
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,682
“Orion Rummler wrote on
Twitter: ‘Awesome video

36
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,140
and writing, but
it also would have

37
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,660
been cool to address
RuPaul’s transphobic comments

38
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,580
as a relative consequence
of his mainstream drag,

39
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,590
especially since so many
straight people consume

40
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,660
his content.

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,356
Seems that convo is lacking.’

42
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,230
For those of you who
aren’t familiar with it,

43
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,610
in an interview,
RuPaul had

44
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,340
said he probably wouldn’t
allow trans women

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,350
or cisgendered
women onto his show.

46
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,900
He put out a tweet that
doubled down on that idea.

47
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,490
Shortly thereafter,
he put out a tweet

48
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,680
essentially apologizing
for his previous tweet.

49
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,479
In previous cuts
of this video,

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,090
we had included this
particular topic.

51
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,590
By the time we got
to the final cut,

52
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,340
it felt to us like it was
too far afield from our more

53
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,720
narrow argument.

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,960
So we had considered it,
unfortunately we just

55
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
didn’t really have
time to address

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,596
that particular
controversy in this video.

57
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:27,970
But we’re going
to put some links

58
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,890
to a few articles on this
very topic in the comments.

59
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,270
And if you’re looking for a
great short history of how

60
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,340
being trans and
being a drag queen

61
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,720
have interacted
with each other,

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,150
I would point you towards my
friend Charlene Incarnate’s

63
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,290
essay on the topic.

64
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,270
And please keep
talking about it.

You can’t mention drag

and Brazil.’”

69
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:53,500
“I love this comment.”

70
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,580
“Excellent point.

71
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,870
Talk about a blind spot.”

72
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,640
“It also gave us
the opportunity

73
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,650
to check out some
amazing video

74
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,780
from some incredible drag
queens around the world.”

75
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:12,550
“So we also made a video
about modern celebrity

76
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,450
on the internet.

77
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,190
A big feature of
this video was

78
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,100
Cameo, an incredible
service that

79
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,880
allows you to pay low-level
celebrities to send you

80
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,605
messages.”

81
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:25,907
“Several levels
of celebrities.”

82
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,370
“Mid-level?

83
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,590
Anyway, one of the celebs that
I solicited a personal video

84
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,740
from, or what I thought
was a personal video,

85
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,056
was Dina Lohan,
Lindsay’s mom.”

86
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,180
“I just want to give you
a shout out from the Lohan

87
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,840
family.

88
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,600
I just got back from
Greece, opening Lohan Beach

89
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,980
Clubs with Lindsay.

90
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,910
I manage Ali and my son,
Dakota, and great things

91
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,510
come are to come
for both children.

92
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,100
I hope you and your
family are well.

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,040
Wishing love, laughter,
and great health.”

94
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,480
“If you notice, she doesn’t
even say my name, or anything

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,390
that I had suggested that
she put in the video.

96
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,940
Which makes me wonder,
has she sent this Cameo

97
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,290
to more than one person?

98
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,410
If you have gotten a
suspicious Cameo from Dina

99
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,400
Lohan, please let us know.

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
I would love to
solve this mystery.

101
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,600
So our final
‘Internetting’ video

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,300
was about surprise videos
and why I hate them.

103
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,649
And at the end
of the video, we

104
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,500
asked you to tell us what
you hate that everybody

105
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,714
else seems to love.”

106
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:24,730
“Ian Lack wrote, ‘I hate
gender reveal videos.’

107
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,540
Everbury 51 wrote, ‘Gender
reveal parties’ videos are

108
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,402
reactionary and
cringe worthy.’

109
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,110
Well, first of all,
they should be called

110
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,685
the sex reveal parties.”

111
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,860
“I spoke with someone
recently who was pregnant.

112
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,740
And when you’re pregnant, you
have to do all these tests.

113
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,870
And the only thing
that you can find out

114
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,140
is that something is bad,
like something has gone wrong.

115
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,030
So with like a
sex reveal party,

116
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,820
even though, as Ian
Lack says, ‘People

117
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,210
are getting excited
about nothing,’ there

118
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,910
is something I think nice
about the nothing, in that

119
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,640
it’s not like, oh,
either everything’s O.K.,

120
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,420
or it’s bad.”

121
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,380
“The sex reveal party is
like a coping mechanism

122
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,796
for like too much
data that you’re

123
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:03,517
getting about your baby.”

124
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:05,500
“All the other sort of
tests that you have to do.”

125
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,630
“And in that respect, aren’t
we all just looking for ways

126
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,400
to mitigate our
anxieties about having

127
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,340
too much information
in our lives?

128
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,350
This season was the first
time on ‘Internetting’

129
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,260
that we interacted with the
comments section on YouTube.

130
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,410
So, thank you guys so much for
leaving comments, interacting

131
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,990
with us, talking to us,
and mostly for thoughtfully

132
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,480
watching your videos, and
responding to it, which

133
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
I was super impressed by.”

134
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,580
“Yeah.

135
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,250
Thank you for not
being horrible monsters.

136
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,870
One thing we heard
over and over again

137
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,310
was how much you
all of the theme

138
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,970
song, which was written and
recorded by Shane O’Neill.

139
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,650
So we are giving you
all a special gift,

140
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,980
which has access to the
theme song on SoundCloud.

141
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,900
You can find it
in the comments.

142
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,630
So we wanted to present
an award to the greatest

143
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,930
commenter, the person
who was there with us

144
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,250
video after video.

145
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,905
And that award goes to — “

146
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,935
“All Things Fascinating,
congratulations on winning — ”

147
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:57,685
“Congratulations.”

148
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:59,870
“ — the first ever
‘Internetting’ Super Fan Award.

149
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,857
You deserve it.”

150
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,190
“So Shane, what’s the best
thing you saw on the internet

151
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,150
this week?”

152
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,910
“Well, Amanda, I went to
an event in Los Angeles

153
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,890
recently, where I
met Meredith Gene

154
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,080
Levine, who is a
Fanthropologist

155
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,430
of online culture.

156
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,025
She introduced me to a new
genre I’d never seen before:

157
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,940
Video footage of
trash being picked up

158
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,806
in residential neighborhoods,
with thrash metal

159
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:24,930
being played underneath it.

160
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,020
Inspiring, gorgeous,
satisfying and super

161
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,980
confusing.

162
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,300
How about you, Amanda,
what’s the best thing

163
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,924
you’ve seen on the
internet this week?”

164
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,162
“Oh, a bunch of round
boys on Instagram.

165
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,070
There was like a round duck.

166
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,940
There’s some round
seals, round rabbits.

167
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,530
There are a lot of
round dogs, which

168
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,196
I think is kind of
cheating, because you

169
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,010
can cut their hair in
whatever way you want.

170
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,620
I think that’s it.

171
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,340
Thank you all so
much for watching.

172
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,560
We really appreciate it.

173
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,570
That is the end of
‘Internetting Season Two.’”

174
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,820
“Thanks so much for watching.”

175
