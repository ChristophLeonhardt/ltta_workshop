1
00:00:02,426 --> 00:00:07,098
PRESIDENT AND JOHN BOLTON AND

2
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:08,699
SEAN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,902
YOU SAID A COUPLE DAYS AGO, I

4
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:13,271
THINK THIS IS GOING IT HAPPEN.

5
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:14,906
GIVEN THE BREAKING NEWS, DO YOU

6
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:16,641
STILL STAND BY THAT?

7
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,410
>> WELL FIRST OF ALL, I'M A

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,711
LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

9
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,413
INTERVIEW NOW WITH YOU BECAUSE

10
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,447
APPARENTLY THIS IS WHAT'S GOING

11
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:27,218
TO HELP DETERMINE THE OUTCOME.

12
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:29,187
LOOK, I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S A

13
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:30,888
MASTER NEGOTIATOR.

14
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:32,156
HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE ART OF

15
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:32,723
THE DEAL.

16
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,592
I DON'T KNOW WE'VE SEEN THE END

17
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:41,966
OF THE SUMMIT JUNE 12 BUT IN

18
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:50,441
LESS KYM  -- KIM JONG-UN MAKES

19
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,609
CONCESSIONS THERE WON'T BE A

20
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:51,943
MEETING.

21
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:55,313
HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS A LEGIT

22
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:56,847
WORLD LEADER AND THE PRESIDENT

23
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:59,350
WON'T GIVE I AM TO HIM UNTIL HE

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,853
MAKES THE CONCESSION TO DUE

25
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,688
NUCLEARIZE THE NORTH KOREA

26
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:05,890
PENINSULA.

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,692
>> Martha: WHEN YOU SEE THE

28
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,094
PHOTOGRAPHS WITH MIKE POMPEO AND

29
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:15,099
KIM JONG-UN AND THE FRIENDLY HOP

30
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,634
SKIPPING OVER THE CURB AT THE

31
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:19,937
BLUE HOUSE WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN

32
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:21,372
LEADER, IT'S CLEAR KIM JONG-UN

33
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,473
WANTED TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION

34
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,542
OF THE SUMMIT BUT ME PRESIDENT

35
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,610
KEEPS REFERRING BACK TO THE

36
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,912
POSSIBILITY THE SECOND MEETING

37
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:31,549
WITH PRESIDENT XI IN CHINA IS

38
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,952
WHEN THINGS START TO FALL APART

39
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:36,687
AND WE'RE LEARNING THE

40
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:38,389
COMMUNICATION START TO BREAK

41
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,525
DOWN DAYS AGO.

42
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,394
YOUR THOUGHTS.

43
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,430
>> YOU HAD THREE HOSTAGES

44
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,798
RELEASED TO THE UNITED STATES IN

45
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,134
AN ACT OF GOOD FAITH AND THE

46
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:52,203
DISMANTLING OF A NUCLEAR SITE.

47
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:55,673
THOSE WERE CLEARLY DONE TO SHOW

48
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:57,408
THAT HE WAS TAKING THE RIGHT

49
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,744
STEPS BUT I THINK HE

50
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,878
OVERESTIMATED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

51
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:02,313
DESIRE TO HAVE THIS MEETING AND

52
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:04,181
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PRETTY CLEAR

53
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,616
UNTIL HE SAW ADDITIONAL CONCRETE

54
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:07,084
STEPS AND CONCESSIONS THAT

55
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:08,985
SHOWED NORTH KOREA WAS TRULY

56
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,689
GOING TO DENUCLEAR THE PENINSULA

57
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:13,057
HE WASN'T GOING TO THE MEETING.

58
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,525
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART.

59
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,127
THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENT

60
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,696
TRUMP -- BANE  BY THE WAY,

61
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:21,766
BY THE WAY, FROM THE BEGINNING

62
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,901
SAID IF WE GET A DEAL, GREAT AND

63
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:27,638
IF WE DON'T, WE DON'T BUT

64
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:29,640
THERE'LL STILL BE AN

65
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,041
OPPORTUNITY.

66
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,709
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR

67
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:32,610
THERE'LL BE CONDITIONS TO BE MET

68
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,146
AND HE'S PLAYED THEM PERFECTLY.

69
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,348
>> AND IN REGARD TO THE

70
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,283
INTERVIEW AND WHAT MIKE PENCE

71
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,352
SAID IN THE INTERVIEW LINED UP

72
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:42,787
WITH THINGS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

73
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,955
PRIOR TO THAT THEY WANTED

74
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,324
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION.

75
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:47,892
THE PRESIDENT AT ONE POINT SAID

76
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:52,730
THEY DOESN'T WANT THE LIBYA

77
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,234
MODEL WHICH IS COMPLETE

78
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,369
DENUCLEARIZATION AND I THINK HE

79
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:03,307
WAS REFERRING TO MOAMMAR GADHAFI

80
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,508
WE'RE GETTING BRAND NEW

81
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:06,177
INFORMATION AND LIGHT BEING SHED

82
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:09,180
ON THE STATEMENT LEADER.

83
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,051
LEADER KIM JONG-UN FOCUSSED

84
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,387
EVERY EFFORT OWN THE MEETING AND

85
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:17,221
THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION DOES

86
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:18,989
NOT MATCH WITH THE WORLD'S

87
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:19,323
DESIRE.

88
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:22,360
IT APPEARS THEY'RE TRYING TO

89
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,096
RE-OPEN THE DOOR AND BEFORE THEY

90
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:27,231
I WANT TO REPLAY THAT BECAUSE

91
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:29,333
THE MEDIA HAD A FIELD DAY WITH

92
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,135
THE LETTER THAT CAME OUT AND THE

93
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:32,269
RESPONSE SAYING THIS HAD BLOWN

94
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,571
UP IN THE PRESIDENT'S FACE AND

95
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,740
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID.

96
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,209
>> THE PRESIDENT -- HE WAS AT

97
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,078
THE END ZONE DANCE AND WE

98
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,847
WEREN'T AT THE 50-YARD LINE YET.

99
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,281
>> IT'S AMAZING THE

100
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,950
ADMINISTRATION ARE SHOCKED THE

101
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,852
NORTH KOREANS ARE ACTING AS

102
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,253
NORTH KOREA ACT.

103
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:55,393
>> HE MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE

104
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:55,659
FIT.

105
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,028
THE LETTER CHUMMING UP LIKE A

106
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:01,031
VALENTINE TO KIM JONG-UN,

107
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,566
REALLY, REALLY?

108
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:07,304
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK,

109
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:07,605
SEAN?

110
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:09,306
>> I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE

111
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:11,142
END OF THIS.

112
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:13,978
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS

113
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:15,279
HOE TO NEGOTIATE BETTER THAN

114
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,914
ANYBODY BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS

115
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:17,314
BACKGROUND.

116
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,517
I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE END

117
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:20,384
OF THIS.

118
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,119
HE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING, IF I

119
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:25,322
CAN MAKE IT WORK, GREAT, IF NOT

120
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:25,723
I'LL WALKY.

121
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,358
HE'S SHOWN HE CAN WALK AWAY.

122
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,659
NOW CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TO COME

123
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,994
BACK TO THE TABLE AND I THINK

124
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:31,762
WE'LL SEE ADDITIONAL

125
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:32,163
CONCESSIONS.

126
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:33,831
MY GUESS IS THERE'S A LOT OF

127
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:36,233
CHAPTERS TO BE WRITTEN IN THE

128
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,301
BOOK BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

129
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:40,738
SHOWN HE CAN WALK AWAY FROM A

130
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,138
BAD DEAL.

131
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:42,973
CHAIRMAN KIM UNDERSTANDS UNTIL

132
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,975
HE GETS THE MEETING HE'S SEEN AS

133
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:50,614
A THIRD-RATE DICT TATAR AND

134
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:51,916
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON'T GRANT HIM

135
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,351
THAT UNTIL HE EXHIBITS REAL

136
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,352
CONCESSIONS AHEAD OF TIME.

137
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:58,222
I KNOW DIRECTOR POMPEO, AND JOHN

138
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,257
BOLTON AND PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOW

139
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:01,926
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I

140
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,327
THINK SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS

141
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:04,495
COMING OUT ARE GETTING TOO OUT

142
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:06,630
IN FRONT OF A STORY THAT HASN'T

143
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,233
SEEN THE END YET.

144
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,837
>> Martha: YOU MENTIONED VICE

145
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:13,871
PRESIDENT PENCE IN THE GROUP.

146
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,072
DO YOU THINK HE STEPPED OUT OF

147
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,674
LINE IN THE INTERVIEW?

148
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:20,311
>> NO, AND I APOLOGIZE WITH ALL

149
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:23,214
DUE RESPECT TO THE VICE

150
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:23,581
PRESIDENT.

151
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,248
THAT'S MY FAULT.

152
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,416
THEY'RE A GREAT TEAM AND KNOW

153
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,417
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

154
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,818
THIS SAY LONG GAME.

155
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:31,856
THEY ALL -- THIS IS A LONG GAME

156
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,257
AND KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND

157
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:35,459
WON'T GRANT NORTH KOREA A FACE

158
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,395
TO FACE MEETING THAT GIVES THEM

159
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,097
LEGITIMACY UNTIL THEY MAKE THE

160
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,198
CONCESSIONS NECESSARY.

161
00:05:41,198 --> 00:00:00,000
REAL CONCRETE THINGS.
