1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:01,419
CELEBRITY.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,054
>> Shannon: FUNNY HOW THAT

3
00:00:03,055 --> 00:00:03,387
HAPPENS.

4
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:06,757
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:08,859
KANYE PRAISING THE TRUMP AGENDA

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,560
WHILE ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THINGS

7
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,428
HE WANTS TO WORK ON WITH THE

8
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:10,962
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

9
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,530
HE SAYS THERE'S WORK TO DO.

10
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:13,998
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE

11
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:14,398
POWER PANEL.

12
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:16,734
HE'S A PARTNER AT FORWARD

13
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:20,104
SOLUTION STRATEGY GROUP.

14
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:20,805
LAWRENCE JONES AND REPUBLICAN

15
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:22,940
NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON

16
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:23,341
KAYLEE.

17
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:24,709
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.

18
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,810
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

19
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:26,544
>> Shannon: I'M GOING TO PLAY

20
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:27,812
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF SOME OF

21
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:30,715
THOSE COMMENTS ON CNN.

22
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:32,550
PREVIEWING KANYE COMING TO THE

23
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,117
WHITE HOUSE.

24
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:34,552
HERE IS WHAT A FORMER G.O.P.

25
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:38,689
SPOKESPERSON HAD TO SAY.

26
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,257
>> LIKE THE PRESIDENT, HE'S ALL

27
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:43,861
OF A SUDDEN THE MODEL

28
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:44,295
SPOKESPERSON.

29
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:46,897
HE IS THE TOKEN OF THE TRUMP

30
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:47,365
ADMINISTRATION.

31
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,299
>> Shannon: I WILL START WITH

32
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,566
YOU.

33
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:51,002
I SORT OF GASPED WHEN SHE SAID

34
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:51,702
THAT.

35
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,137
THAT IS QUITE A LINE.

36
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:54,739
>> LET ME SAY THIS.

37
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,307
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BLACK

38
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:57,842
REPUBLICANS WITHIN THE MOVEMENT

39
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,810
THAT HAVE TRIED TO MOBILIZE

40
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:02,647
BLACK FOLKS IN THE PAST, AND

41
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:10,821
HAVE BEEN NOT SUCCESSFUL.

42
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:11,555
KANYE IS NOT THE MOST ARTICULATE

43
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:12,223
FELLOW BUT HE TALKS THE TALK

44
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:12,890
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR

45
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,225
COMMUNITY, SO FOR THEM TO SIT ON

46
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:14,925
THEIR INTELLECTUAL HIGH HORSE

47
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:16,927
AND PRETEND LIKE THEY HAVE

48
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:18,529
SOMEHOW BEEN EFFECTIVE OVER THE

49
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,263
LAST 30 YEARS OF GETTING BLACK

50
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:22,533
FOLKS TO SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN

51
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:23,601
PARTY, I THINK IS INSULTING.

52
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:25,002
I THINK IT'S TIME TO START

53
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:25,836
SHAKING THIS UP.

54
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:29,540
WHAT KANYE DID WAS RAW, IT WAS

55
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,308
NECESSARY, DID I AGREE WITH

56
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:31,909
EVERYTHING?

57
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,144
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

58
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:34,712
DID HE PROVIDE A LOT OF

59
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:35,079
SOLUTIONS?

60
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,813
NO HE DIDN'T.

61
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:36,480
BUT IT'S A STARTING PLACE.

62
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,083
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE

63
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:39,917
CRITICIZING HIM SAYS IT SHOULD

64
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:41,152
NOT HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE

65
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:41,552
OVAL OFFICE.

66
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:42,820
I'M SORRY, THAT IS THAT PEOPLE'S

67
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:46,290
HOUSE AND I THINK THAT IS WHERE

68
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,091
WE NEED TO START HAVING THESE

69
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:49,794
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PRESIDEN

70
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:50,161
PRESIDENT.

71
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,128
>> HE'S A CREATIVE GUY.

72
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,563
HE HAS PUT OUT SOME FANTASTIC

73
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:54,532
MOVEMENT AND SOME INTERESTING

74
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:55,900
THINGS, THE FASHION.

75
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,134
I WON'T COMMENT ON.

76
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:58,169
BUT THIS GUY IS A CREATIVE GUY.

77
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,337
HE TALKED TODAY WITH THE PRESS

78
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:01,539
ABOUT, LISTEN, I'M COMPLEX.

79
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,708
I WON'T GIVE YOU A QUICK LITTLE

80
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:04,175
SOUND BITE.

81
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:05,810
I AM LIKE A FINE WINE WITH A LOT

82
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:08,312
OF DIFFERENT NOTES.

83
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,879
SO HE HAD SOME INTERESTING

84
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:13,117
THINGS TO SAY BUT IS HE BEING

85
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:13,918
DISCREDITED OR DISREGARDED

86
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,619
BECAUSE HE'S WILLING TO BE

87
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,688
SOMEWHAT SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

88
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:18,055
PRESIDENT?

89
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,690
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

90
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,692
I DON'T THINK YOU SEE THAT

91
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:22,359
AROUND OTHER CELEBRITIES WHO

92
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,427
HAVE SUPPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP.

93
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,830
I DON'T THINK YOU SEE THAT ON

94
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,131
OTHER CELEBRITIES ON THE OTHER

95
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,132
SIDE OF THE AISLE.

96
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,934
IF ANYTHING, THERE IS MUCH ADO

97
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:32,536
ABOUT NOTHING IN THE FACT THAT I

98
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:33,671
JUST DON'T THINK THESE CELEBRITY

99
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,740
ENDORSEMENTS, TAYLOR SWIFT,

100
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,141
KANYE WEST REALLY CARRY THAT

101
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:39,310
MUCH WEIGHT WITH AN ELECTORATE.

102
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,145
ALL THAT SAID, WHAT I THINK IS

103
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:42,680
NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH

104
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,115
HERE, AND I SAY THIS IN ALL

105
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:44,849
SERIOUSNESS BECAUSE IT REALLY

106
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,550
BOTHERS ME TO SEE PEOPLE MAKING

107
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,519
LIGHT OF IT, I THINK WE HAVE A

108
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,321
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN AMERICA.

109
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:52,523
I THINK MR. WEST WAS VERY OPEN

110
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:53,591
ABOUT COMING OFF MEDICATION, I

111
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,494
THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

112
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:57,361
REPORTS IN THE MEDIA ABOUT

113
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,130
PEOPLE IN HIS INNER CIRCLE

114
00:02:59,131 --> 00:02:59,630
VOICING CONCERNS.

115
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,799
I THINK THAT IS A SEPARATE TOPIC

116
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,500
FROM THE POLITICS AND I HOPE

117
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,001
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN SPARK

118
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:04,902
A CONVERSATION.

119
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:07,905
>> JUST BECAUSE HE HAS MENTAL

120
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:08,572
ISSUES, THERE ARE A LOT OF

121
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:09,907
AMERICANS WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH

122
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:11,776
ISSUES WHO CAN STILL TALK ABOUT

123
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:12,510
POLITICS IN AMERICA.

124
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:17,348
THEY CAN STILL TALK ABOUT WHAT'S

125
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,818
AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITY.

126
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:21,519
TO SIT ON NATIONAL TV AND SAY

127
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,253
THAT WE SHOULD SOMEHOW DISCREDIT

128
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:22,520
HIM.

129
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,121
>> I DID NOT SAY THAT!

130
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,122
>> Shannon: GENTLEMAN, STOPPED

131
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,123
FOR A SECOND HERE.

132
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,925
STOP FOR A SECOND.

133
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,226
>> THAT'S LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE

134
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:30,060
OF WHAT I SAID.

135
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,062
>> Shannon: I THINK WHAT YOU

136
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:33,497
MEANT, THERE IS A CONNECTION.

137
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:35,132
WE HEARD THE SAME THING ON

138
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:35,866
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" THE OTHER

139
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,668
NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE TALKING

140
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,303
ABOUT KANYE AND SAYING, I DON'T

141
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,204
WANT TO HEAR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE

142
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,105
HAVE TO SAY.

143
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,006
HE TALKED ABOUT HOTDOGS BECAUSE

144
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,307
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

145
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:45,276
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR KANYE TALK

146
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:46,310
ABOUT THIS.

147
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,145
THEY ALSO USE THE WORDS "MENTAL

148
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,713
HEALTH ILLNESS" AND A LOT OF

149
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:53,584
PEOPLE WILL WERE UNCOMFORTABLE.

150
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:54,218
IT'S BECAUSE THAT WAS PETE

151
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,489
DAVIDSON WHO HAS COME OUT ABOUT

152
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,490
HIS OWN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND

153
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:01,492
THE DANGERS HE'S FACED.

154
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:03,093
WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT WHEN HE WAS

155
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:04,395
OFF HIS MEDICATION, HE TALKED

156
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:05,496
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

157
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:06,096
I THINK THERE'S A REAL

158
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:08,132
SERIOUSNESS HERE.

159
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,100
SEPARATE FROM THE POLITICS, IT

160
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:10,534
SHOULD MATTER.

161
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,469
>> Shannon: HE'S DONE A LOT OF

162
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,337
THINGS THAT PEOPLE EITHER WANT

163
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:14,205
TO DISREGARD OR DON'T WANT TO

164
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,106
PAY ATTENTION TO, BUT HERE'S

165
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:17,107
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT VIOLENCE AND

166
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,010
GUNS IN CHICAGO, HIS HOMETOWN.

167
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:23,113
>> ILLEGAL GUNS ARE THE PROBLEM,

168
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:23,581
NOT LEGAL GUNS.

169
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:26,116
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

170
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,384
>> Shannon: THAT WAS QUITE A

171
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:28,085
STATEMENT THERE.

172
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:29,620
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WIN ANY

173
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,288
POINTS WITH THE LEFT, EITHER.

174
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,323
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO.

175
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:33,224
HE MADE A LOT OF GOOD POINTS.

176
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:35,759
HE TALKED ABOUT ANY FACTORING,

177
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,529
BRINGING JOBS BACK TO MIDDLE

178
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,897
AMERICA, HE TALKED ABOUT

179
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:40,497
WELFARE.

180
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,299
HE HAD VERY WELL-INFORMED

181
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,033
POLITICAL OPINIONS, BUT WE ARE

182
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,101
GOING TO HEAR THE LEFT CALL HIM

183
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,703
MENTALLY ILL, AS MANY HAVE DONE,

184
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:48,505
SAY HE'S OFF HIS MEDICINE, AS

185
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:48,939
WAS JUST SAID.

186
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,474
LAWRENCE IS RIGHT, IT'S AN

187
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:51,709
EFFORT TO DISCREDIT HIM.

188
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,476
COMPARE THE WAY FOLKS TALKED

189
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:55,512
ABOUT KANYE BEFORE HE CAME OUT

190
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:56,113
FOR TRENT.

191
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:57,982
THEY CALLED HIM A GENIUS IN

192
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,449
"ROLLING STONE."

193
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,752
THE KING HIP-HOP.

194
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:07,124
THEN ON CNN, PUBLICITY.

195
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,259
THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE.

196
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,495
CALLING HIM A TOKEN.

197
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,696
HE'S THE MOST AWARDED GRAMMY

198
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,698
WINNER IN HISTORY, BUT

199
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:15,900
NEVERTHELESS, NOW HE'S DERIDED

200
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:16,901
AS MENTALLY ILL.

201
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:18,168
FOLKS TALK ABOUT HIM ENTIRELY

202
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:19,503
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE HE IS NOW A

203
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:19,970
DRUM SUPPORTED.

204
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,338
IT IS WRONG, AND ANYONE POINTING

205
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,909
TO THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CONNIE

206
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,143
WEST IS DOING A DISSERVICE TO

207
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:27,711
MENTAL HEALTH AND THE CRISIS OF

208
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:30,514
THIS COUNTRY.

209
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:31,248
KANYE HIMSELF TALKED ABOUT THAT

210
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,317
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

211
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:35,319
>> Shannon: HE SAID HE WAS

212
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,920
MISDIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR.

213
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,288
ACCORDING TO HIM AND HIS MEDICAL

214
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,290
TEAM, HE SAID THAT WAS A WRONG

215
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:39,823
DIAGNOSIS FOR HIM.

216
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:41,058
THAT'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT

217
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:41,358
THAT.

218
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,694
I WANT TO MAKE SURE --

219
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:45,296
>> HIS OWN FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE

220
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:47,564
CLOSE TO HIM DISAGREE.

221
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,867
>> Shannon: LET'S MOVE ON FROM

222
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:50,701
THAT.

223
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:51,502
WE ARE NOT.

224
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:52,903
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

225
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:53,771
HAVE A DISTINCTION THERE AS YOU

226
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,905
ARE TRYING TO MAKE, AS WELL.

227
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,373
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE TALK

228
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,008
ABOUT -- ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES

229
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,710
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS

230
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:01,912
PRISON REFORM, SENTENCING

231
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:02,680
REFORM, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

232
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,549
JARED KUSHNER IS GETTING A LOT

233
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,717
OF CREDIT FOR TRYING TO

234
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,085
INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENT ON

235
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:08,719
THOSE.

236
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,921
JONES, HE SAYS THIS ABOUT JARED

237
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:12,122
KUSHNER, HIS RELENTLESS

238
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,091
SINGLE-MINDEDNESS HAS EARNED THE

239
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:15,292
RESPECT OF HIS SUPPORTERS AND

240
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:15,726
RETRACTORS.

241
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:17,328
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE

242
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:18,529
SINGLE-HANDEDLY KEPT THE IDEA OF

243
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,998
PRISON REFORM ALIVE THROUGH HIS

244
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:23,033
DEDICATION AND WILLPOWER ALONE.

245
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:26,103
EACH OF YOU WAY ON THIS QUICKLY

246
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:26,437
PLEASE.

247
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,906
>> I'M GLAD TO SEE PROGRESS

248
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:30,074
BEING MADE.

249
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:31,075
I THINK RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS

250
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:32,543
ARE SPLIT ON IT, DEMOCRATS ARE

251
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,311
SPLIT ON IT.

252
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,479
HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE THINGS

253
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,147
DONE TO FIX IT INCLUDING MAKING

254
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,383
IT PART OF A BIGGER PACKAGE THAT

255
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:40,384
ADDRESSES SENTENCING REFORM, AS

256
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:40,684
WELL.

257
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:42,987
AT THIS POINT, WE NEED TO BE

258
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,488
THANKFUL FOR ANY STEPS MOVING

259
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,289
FORWARD.

260
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,291
WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW TO MAKE

261
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:47,958
THAT PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE

262
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,292
PLAN.

263
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:49,159
I HOPE PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL

264
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,499
STAND UP TO THE 30 CONSERVATIVE

265
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,101
LEADERS FEATURED IN "BREITBART."

266
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,602
THIS IS A FIRST STEP TO BUILD

267
00:06:58,603 --> 00:06:58,869
ON.

268
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,904
>> THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ON

269
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,106
BOTH SIDES THAT BELIEVE THAT

270
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:03,540
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM NEEDS TO

271
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:03,874
HAPPEN.

272
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,977
FROM THE CONSERVATIVE MEMBER,

273
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:09,813
TED CRUZ, RAND PAUL, ALL THE WAY

274
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:11,582
TO THE CORY BOOKERS OF THE

275
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:11,915
WORLD.

276
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,484
I COMMEND THE PRESIDENT FOR

277
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:13,917
STARTING THIS.

278
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,185
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL

279
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,086
AMERICANS SHOULD GET BEHIND.

280
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,255
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS,

281
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,523
BECAUSE YOU'VE STILL GOT JEFF

282
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,691
SESSIONS, WHOSE ATTORNEY

283
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,693
GENERAL, WHO HAS NOT BEEN

284
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:23,427
SUPPORTIVE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

285
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:23,761
REFORM.

286
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:24,495
>> Shannon: IF IT COMES DOWN

287
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,497
TO HIM OR JEFF SESSIONS ON THIS,

288
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,298
WE ARE GOING WITH THE

289
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,566
PRESIDENT'S PLAN.

290
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,300
>> JARED KUSHNER DESERVE SO MUCH

291
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,503
CREDIT HERE.

292
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,271
VENGEANCE GAVE ME THAT QUOTE

293
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:34,905
FROM MY ARTICLE.

294
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:36,540
WE'RE IN THIS TOWN IN D.C. THAT

295
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,608
YOU GET A CONGRESSMAN ON THE

296
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:41,111
RIGHT AND THE LEFT PRAISING

297
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:41,512
SOMEONE.

298
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:42,713
HE SAID JARRETT HAS BEEN

299
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:43,947
INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS, AND DOUG

300
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:45,682
COLLINS THAT WE ARE ONE VOTE

301
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:46,517
AWAY IN THE SENATE.

302
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,485
ONE BOAT FROM PRISON REFORM.

303
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:49,486
THIS HAS ONLY BEEN DONE TWICE IN

304
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:52,856
MODERN HISTORY.

305
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:53,724
ONE VOTE AWAY, THEY DESERVE A

306
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,660
LOT OF CREDIT.

307
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:58,295
>> Shannon: TO GET BIPARTISAN

308
00:07:58,296 --> 00:00:00,000
COOPERATION MOVING ON THESE
