Greg: IN THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN AN ELECTION THAT OCCURRED A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, MICHELLE OBAMA WAS ASKED HOW TRUMP WON, AND SHE LAY THE BLAME ON HILLARY. JUST KIDDING. SHE BLAMED SEXISM FROM WOMEN AGAINST WOMEN. IN LIGHT OF THIS LAST ELECTION, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT US AS WOMEN AND HOW WE THINK. IF WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOTION THAT A WOMAN COULD BE OUR PRESIDENT COMPARED TO WHAT? YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH OURSELVES AS WOMEN. Greg: MAYBE SO, BUT HER ANALYSIS SEEMS A SYMPTOM OF A GREATER PROBLEM THAT CONTRIBUTED TO HER PARTY'S LOSS. GOES BACK TO SEEING THE GROUP
