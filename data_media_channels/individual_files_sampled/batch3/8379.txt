ANOTHER WAY FOR THE DOJ TO STONEWALL THEM. TRACE? Trace: JOHN ROBERTS LIVE. WE'LL GO BACK WHEN THE BRIEFING BEGINS. THANK YOU. NORTH KOREA SAID THEY'RE SHUTTING DOWN A NUCLEAR TEST SITE AND BRINGING IN FOREIGN JOURNALISTS TO WATCH. THIS COULD BE FOR SHOW. SCIENTISTS SAY THE SITE COLLAPSED ON ITS OWN AND MAY ALREADY BE USELESS. THIS IS A VIEW OF THE FACILITY SIMPLE SPACE PROVIDED BY DIGITAL GLOBE. WE'RE EXPECTING THE NORTH KOREANS TO BLOW UP THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN AND SEAL SOME TUNNELS. THERE'S WORD WE COULD SEE VIDEO OF THE DEMOLITION TOMORROW MORNING THAT DEPENDS ON THE WEATHER. GREG PALKOT IS LIVE IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA WITH MORE. GREG? TRACE, PROBABLY THE BEST SIGN ABOUT WHETHER THERE ARE ANY SERIOUS BUMPS IN U.S.-NORTH KOREA DIPLOMACY COULD BE FOUND RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. IT'S ALL ABOUT DISMEMBERMENT, THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR TEST SITE IN THE NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE COUNTRY. THIS HAD BEEN PLANNED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, BEFORE THE RECENT DIPLOMATIC TURBULENCE. NORTH KOREA FLEW A SMALL GROUP OF HAND-PICKED INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS TO AN EAST COAST CITY IN THE COUNTRY. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON A TRAIN RIGHT NOW. SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T LEFT. SO FAR THE REASON GIVEN IS WEATHER. IT'S BEEN DAMP HERE. WHETHER THE REGIME IS NOW HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT GOING THROUGH WITH THIS, THAT IS THE QUESTION. AS YOU NOTED, TRACE, THIS IS AN EASY GIVE FOR NORTH KOREA. MANY SCIENTISTS SAID THAT BASICALLY THIS SITE WAS OUT OF ORDER. THAT YOU COULDN'T USE IT AGAIN. IT DIDN'T MERELY MATTER WHETHER IT WAS DESTROYED. BUT TRACE, HUGE SYMBOLIC VALUE. WILL NORTH KOREA SQUANDER THIS IF THE DATE OF THE SUMMIT IS NOW IN PLAY. BACK TO NUCLEAR SITE? YEAH, SOUTH KOREA, OF COURSE, TRACE, IS WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY. WATCHING EVERYTHING VERY CLOSELY. THEY HAVE A HUMONGOUS AMOUNT INVESTED IN THIS WHOLE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS. IF YOU REMEMBER BACK TO APRIL 27, THAT'S WHEN KIM JONG-UN AND SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON MET ALONG THE DMZ. JUST LAST WEEK, AS YOU NOTED, TALKS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WERE CANCELLED. OSTENSIVELY BECAUSE OF ONGOING BUT THEY KNEW ABOUT THEM EXERCISES BETWEEN U.S. AND SOUTH KOREAN TROOPS AROUND THIS PENINSULA. ALSO, THERE'S MORE STRONG WINDS COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION. HERE WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO MORE STRONG WINDS COMING FROM THE NORTH. AN OLD LINE FROM KIM JONG-UN. THAT IS WHY ACCORDING TO LOCAL MEDIA HERE, PRESIDENT MOON WENT TO THE D.C. TO SPEAK WITH BIT OF DAMAGE CONTROL. IT ALL GOES DOWN, TRACE, TO ONE MAN. AGAIN, IT SEEMS ACCORDING TO A COUPLE OF ANALYSTS WE'VE TALKED TO HERE, KIM JONG-UN. HE'S ABOUT 120 MILES NORTH OF HERE IN PYONGYANG AND WANTS AGAIN, AGAIN, ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE EXPERTS, HE'S CALLING THE SHOTS FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE FOR THIS COUNTRY, FOR THIS PENINSULA. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK FOR THE
