hi I'm Rihanna welcome back to my
channel and today huh I gotta embarrass
myself
what's the hey in case you didn't know
although my channel has grown to the
slider days within the last like year
eight years ago I bought a shitty little
camera and started fucking around on
YouTube before YouTube was even a thing
those very videos of me at the age of 16
or 17 they still exist
deep in the privatized section of my
channel so I have pulled out one of the
right first one I haven't watched it in
seven years and we're going to just have
a little look before phobar's
I got the earphones got the lap oh the
video I picked is called join me I don't
know what it means
let's do this
oh okay we are 26 seconds into the video
and nothing has happened
oh I remember okay so you might know am
a youtuber called Fred he's still around
today he used to do this thing in every
video he'd have this squeaky voice so I
obviously went oh that's cool
I'm gonna steal it and use it as my own
just like I stole the bees fucking hell
Riyadh come on
oh Jesus the whole videos in the fucking
voice I got to translate for you okay so
I just said exams are over did you hear
that bling Oh God
some of you may remember that MSN
Messenger where you'd speak to random
strange people all over the world you've
never met he would ask you to like strip
naked oh god no and-and-and-and but am I
going to do for some who told you Riyadh
that this was entertaining I'm literally
taking every effect that I can use in my
editing software and got all got a fuck
that in and make it real fancy and shit
wet wet wet wet well what is with the
crazy eye
okay drinking you're kidding
you kidding haha Riyadh cheer some
things never change
okay I was slightly underage like by a
year but I was in my own house that my
parents do yes I think they knew because
you're alone or filming yourself
drinking in your bedroom oh I love this
kid oca√±a party let me just tell you
that camera cost me all of like two
three euro at the time at the camera and
the microphone in one I mean the
technology Oh
musical interlude what happens two hours
later good idea

fuck is that holy shit

embarrassed than I thought I would be I
I would hang out with that little shit I
think he is fun and weird what a little
what a little legend
oh it's also amazing to think that this
little kid in his bedroom never knew
that that would then become his job that
is now my job God if I could like
