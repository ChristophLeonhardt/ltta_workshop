8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,970
is a sore point<font color="#CCCCCC"> that emerges from time</font>

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,619
to time as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the relations</font>

what's the difference let's move on ever

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,110
since time began human<font color="#E5E5E5"> beings have found</font>

15

their chief consolation and joy in the

<font color="#CCCCCC">love between a man and a woman and their</font>

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,649
chief purpose and meaning in the

indispensable<font color="#CCCCCC"> care and tenderness of</font>

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,730
being a mother and homemaker and the

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,829
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> and authority of being a</font>

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,469
father and provider feminism is an

attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put an end to all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,280
that unhappy neurotics can parade around

in stupid pink hats screaming about

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,129
something god knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> what feminists feel</font>

26
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,290
that for too long men<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten away</font>

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,420
with having sex with<font color="#CCCCCC"> women and getting</font>

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,490
them pregnant and marrying them and then

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,380
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they and their children have</font>

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,240
a roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> over their head and food</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat</font>

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it means the man has to work</font>

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,140
until his fingers bleed and compromise

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,150
his dreams and principles so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

children can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the all-important</font>

37
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,700
for some reason feminists believe that

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,860
men are grotesque foul-mouthed

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,229
ill-mannered bullies who treat women as

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,090
if they were nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than vaginas</font>

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they feel a feminist can do all that</font>

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">just as well as any man feminists are</font>

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,020
angry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some men treat sex is a</font>

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">fleeting meaningless physical pleasure</font>

45
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,890
and they feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> women should treat</font>

46
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,960
sex the same way and then wake up

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,610
feeling disgusted with themselves and

48
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,590
then blame men for their sense of shame

49
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,560
not to mention their incurable STD and

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,600
the baby they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to abort so that now</font>

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
they'll spend the rest of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives</font>

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,689
distorting their own sense of morality

53
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,000
in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid facing up to what</font>

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,210
they've done then everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

55
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,000
fair feminists believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> women and</font>

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">men</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have exactly the same capabilities</font>

57
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,230
and it's only societal

58
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,269
that causes<font color="#E5E5E5"> men to be better at math and</font>

59
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">science and women to be better at</font>

60
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,780
knowing that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 year old has been</font>

61
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing something he wasn't supposed to be</font>

62
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,230
doing even before he comes to the

63
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,349
freaking door for heaven's sake

64
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,180
feminists are sick and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tired of being</font>

65
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,250
treated like children who need a man<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

66
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,349
take care of them and demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,030
treated like children who need the

68
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,670
government to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

69
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,200
feminists believe that men have created

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,470
a world of unfettered capitalism

71
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,879
unbridled aggression and constant

72
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,950
warfare and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight that by</font>

73
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,349
making money<font color="#E5E5E5"> acting tough and serving in</font>

74
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,099
combat<font color="#CCCCCC"> in general feminists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

75
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,799
men are bad and women are<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and women</font>

76
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,989
should be men and will then be bad which

77
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,829
will then be good so basically feminism

78
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:02,430
is completely irrational women trigger

Russia of it all we'll find out tomorrow

158
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,970

159
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,470
play it it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a big big story</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tomate by tomorrow they're gonna realize</font>

162
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,120
it was just a minor shift you do I don't

163
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,800
even think he went I think he<font color="#E5E5E5"> went once</font>

164
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,990
he attended one meeting and then Flynn

165
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,220
was gone and he didn't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

166
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,040
anymore so let's cover the important

167
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,930
stuff Barry Manilow has come out as

168
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,540
being gay I know you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knocked</font>

169
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,630
me over with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feather you know okay</font>

170
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,190
next next you're gonna tell me it was

171
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,870
like Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sims Simmons you know</font>

172
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,120
you're gonna like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like Oscar</font>

173
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,920
Wilde was gay there's a key city

174
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,980
occasion you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out until now because</font>

175
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">you didn't want to disappoint his fans</font>

176
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,510
you know because they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

177
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,730
like you know why he's gray what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

178
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,100
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> his crazy young man still I should</font>

179
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,710
he be great okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know anyway I</font>

180
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,970
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think would be much more</font>

181
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,740
exciting if he came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and admitted he</font>

182
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,030
was Taylor Swift that would account for

183
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,160
both of their music I think what was the

184
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,870
other one Oh milania's arms are crossed

185
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,180
they put out an official portrait of her

186
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,190
and her arms across nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the Boston</font>

187
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,750
Globe actually ran an entire op-ed about

188
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,640
what it means that her arms are crossed

189
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,340
because like Trump nothing that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump</font>

190
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,840
does can be possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rest they forgot</font>

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,370
that John of Kennedy's arms across as a

192
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,350
favorite famous portrait of his you know

193
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,120
looking down and all that stuff anyway

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,610
but the big one my favorite story was

195
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,530
this Pepsi commercial have you seen this

196
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,470
Pepsi commercial commercial I'll

197
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,060
describe it because I know that some

198
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,920
people are listening not watching it the

199
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,170
Pepsi commercial it has this this

200
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,030
demonstration and you can't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

201
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,440
the demonstrations force for love and

202
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,090
peace it's for love and peace it's a

203
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,510
meaningless demonstration and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kendall</font>

204

205
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,860

208
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,070
formerly Bruce right that's right miss

209
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,930
Martha's kendall Jenner she's a model

210
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,550
and you know that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must have a lot of</font>

211
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,990
psychological problems because

212
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,660
father is now a sort of her mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

213
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,510
she's in this thing this big protest is

214
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,920
going by and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kendall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenner is in a</font>

215
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,170
blond wig and she's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a photo shoot</font>

216
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,360
right and I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

217
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,250
good-looking guy kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of says kind of</font>

218
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,290
join the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> activism and all this stuff</font>

219
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kendall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenner for Oracle e takes</font>

220
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,220
off her blonde wig and wipes off her

221
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,140
lipstick and joins the march and there's

222
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,790
a Muslim woman in there for some reason

223
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,050
I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what she's doing she's</font>

224
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,330
taking pictures and she picks<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a Pepsi</font>

225
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,610
because it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Betsey commercial and she</font>

226
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,920
hands it to the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of grim-faced cop</font>

227
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,140
the riot cops are out there protecting

228
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,330
people and she hands it to him and he

229
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,150
takes a sip of pepsi and he smiles and

230
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,080
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it's so the right</font>

231
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,720
hated this because it romanticizes the

232
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,970
all these marches and protests and the

233
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,130
left hated it because it trivializes all

234
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,600
these marches and protests because it

235
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,250
actually was an accurate depiction of

236
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,630
the marches and protests as being

237
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,850
meaningless confusing groups of people

238
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,830
kind of parading their virtue and all

239
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,450
this stuff and it makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about</font>

240
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,790
kendall jenner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pepsi i love this</font>

241
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,710
commercial because it illustrates the

242
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,510
genius of capitalism the genius

243
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,040
capitalism I've always noticed this

244
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,930
capitalism is like the blob do you

245
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,460
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> old horror movie with</font>

246
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,140
Steve McQueen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ian on the blob would come</font>

247
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and eat people and then they would</font>

248
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,720
digest in the blob would get bigger

249
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,520
right that's what capitalism does if

250
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,900
you're a communist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're going to</font>

251
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,060
power to the worker we all work with the

252
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,410

261
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,500
cola that's all that mattered so I loved

262
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,090
it it was like capitalism at it's very

263
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,600
best trivializing<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get angry about</font>

264
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,660
just as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're by the soda so</font>

265
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,280

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,320
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about yesterday and</font>

267
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,090

268
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,500

269
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,360
wrote The Hitchhiker's Guide to the

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,550
galaxy just before Adams died he moved

271
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Santa Barbara and I became acquainted</font>

272
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,090

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,680
news

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,390
back out because for Europeans when they

281
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,520

lepen but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know the</font>

305
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,800
issues over there they know because

place so I have to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up and I</font>

310
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,910

including women and children is

342
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,280
reprehensible and cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ignored by</font>

343
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,530
the civilized world these heinous

344
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,400
actions by the Bashar al-assad regime

345
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,740
are a consequence of the past

346
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,990
administrations weakness and<font color="#E5E5E5"> II</font>

347
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolution President Obama said in 2012</font>

348
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,620
that he would establish a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote unquote</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">red line against the use of chemical</font>

350
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,060

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,310
States stands with our allies across the

352
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:57,490
globe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> condemn this intolerable act so</font>

353
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,010
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now let's let's go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back just</font>

354
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,720
quickly over this everything Spicer said

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,360
is true<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really Obama boluda people</font>

356

who the mid Middle East really he really

357

did not just pulling out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Iraq like</font>

358
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,970
that but what happened you'll remember

359
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,270
is that Hillary Clinton basically

360
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,040
convinced Obama to go into Libya and

361
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,050
overthrow Gaddafi and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turned into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

362
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,150
absolute disaster that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was what Obama</font>

363
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,100
said was the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake of his</font>

364
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,600
presidency the worst thing happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

365
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,270
his presidency<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protests in syria</font>

366
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,400
started out as peaceful protest they

367
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,630
weren't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to overthrow the</font>

368
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,830
regime they were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying give us</font>

369
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,740
some more from civil<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights and obama</font>

anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't give them any support</font>

372
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">really didn't stand up for them at all</font>

373
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then assad responded to those</font>

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,990
protests with absolute brutality you

375
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,490
know total killing torturing the whole

376
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,020
thing and then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

377
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">weak Assad must go but we didn't do</font>

have been very clear to the Assad regime

384
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,480
but also to other players on the ground

385
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,460
that a red line for us is we start
