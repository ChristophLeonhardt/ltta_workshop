44
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,611
WOULD NEED TO PUBLICLY DEFEND

WILD ALLEGATIONS OF GANG RAPE

61

IN OTHER WORDS IT IS IN FACT

63
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,871
POSSIBLE TO GO TOO FAR.

64
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:55,772

MESSAGE.

67
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,210
YET, NONE OF IT SEEMS OBVIOUS

68
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:01,578

THE CONSTITUTION IS

75
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:10,487
MEANINGLESS.

76
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:12,789
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE MUST GO.

77
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,725
ONLY A COUNTRY DIVIDED INTO

78
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:16,560
WARRING TRIBES CAN BE RULED

79
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:16,960
EFFECTIVELY.

80
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:18,729
IF WE CAN'T CONTROL IT, LET'S

81
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,596
BURN IT DOWN.

82
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,965
THAT IS THE MESSAGE THEY HAVE

83
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:22,599
INTERNALIZED.

84
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,967
WATCH HOW ACTIVISTS GATHERED

85
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:25,369
AT THE SUPREME COURT AND

86
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,370

THIS, THIS IS NOT A CLIP FROM

90
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:31,675
A ZOMBIE MOVIE.

00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:40,884
IT'S WASHINGTON, D.C., 2018.

92
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:45,322

THE RAGING CONTINUED ON CABLE

96

NEWS AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

97
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:53,063
WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE

"WHITE MEN ARE BAD."

101
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,736
THE MESSAGE WAS COORDINATED.

102
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:02,205
THE MEDIA FIGURES SEEM TO SAY

103
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,173
THE SAME THING AT THE SAME

104
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:03,673
TIME.

105
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:05,008
INDEED THEY WERE.

106
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,510
THEY WERE REPEATING TALKING

107
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:08,278
POINTS FROM THE DEMOCRATIC

108
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,679

109
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,180
FAITHFULLY SERVE.

110
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,015
FOR GENERATIONS CONSERVATIVES

111
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:14,184
CALLED THIS "THE LIBERAL

00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:14,518
MEDIA."

113
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,919
BUT THAT IS NOT QUITE RIGHT.

114
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,487
THESE ARE NOT LIBERALS.

115
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,922
THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO

116
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,490
BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH OR

117
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,792
TRANSPARENCY OR DUE PROCESS OR

118
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,360
CHALLENGING CORPORATE POWER OR

119
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,363
ANY OTHER RECOGNIZABLE LIBERAL

120
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:26,730
VALUE.

121
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:27,731
THESE ARE PARTY PEOPLE.

122
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:28,932
THEY ARE HACKS.

123
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,134
AND JOINERS AND DRONES.

124
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:32,402

128
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:36,239
TOLD.

129
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,375
THEY ARE ROBOTS.

130
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:39,643
LIBERALS USED TO DEFEND THE

131
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:40,844
RIGHTS OF THE MINORITY.

132
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,578
GOOD FOR THEM.

133
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,680
WATCH NOW AS HILLARY CLINTON

134
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,815
EXPLAINS HOW ENTIRE STATES

135
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,416
SHOULD LOSE THE POLITICAL

136
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:47,584
POWER BECAUSE VOTERS DON'T

137
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,386
AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE

138
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:50,620
RICH KIDS IN BROOKLYN.

139
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,288
WATCH THIS.

140
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,423
>> DO YOU THINK THE ELECTORAL

141
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:56,693

142
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,794

143
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:58,895
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2000

ELECTION WITH AL GORE.

145

ANACHRONISM DESIGNED FOR

146
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,801
ANOTHER TIME NO LONGER WORKS.

147
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,670
WE HAVE MOVED TOWARD ONE

148
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,471
PERSON, ONE VOTE.

149
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:10,674
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE

150
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:11,074
ELIMINATED.

151
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,609
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US MOVE

152
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,378
BEYOND IT.

153
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:15,846
YES.

154
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,280

ELECTORAL COLLEGE EITHER.

156
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,816
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS  MANY

157
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:20,884
HAVE BEEN SAYING THE SENATE

158
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,085
ITSELF SHOULD BE CHANGED.

159
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,720
WITH THE DIFFERENT STATES

160
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,654
HAVING A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF

161
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:25,021
SENATORS.

162
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:26,490
ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY ON

163
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,958
THE LEFT SEEMS TO BE SAYING

164
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,192
THINGS LIKE THIS.

165
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,161
INCLUDING SUPPOSEDLY UNBIASED

166
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:31,528
REPORTERS.

167
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:38,835
SHUT UP, -- SHUT UP, WYOMING.

168
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:39,836
NOBODY CARE WHAT IS YOU THINK.

169
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,872
THE LEFT HAS NEVER BEEN BIG ON

170
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:43,006
SELF-AWARENESS.

171
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:46,109
THIS IS ONE ESPECIALLY AMAZING

172
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,344
EXAMPLE OF THAT.

173
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,346
THIS IS AN ONION PIECE WAITING

174
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:50,647
TO BE WRITTEN.

175
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:51,915

SAVOR IT.

188

00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:20,310
IS TOO DARN BAD.

194
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:21,311
>> Tucker: YEAH, THAT IS

195
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:23,847
WHAT TOM STEREO IS AGAINST --

196
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:25,982
TOM STIRE ARE AGAINST.

197

LET US KNOW WHEN YOU STOP

198
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:28,785
SNICKERING.

199
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,186
THINK ABOUT WHAT HE IS SAYING.

200
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,422
HE IS SAYING BRETT KAVANAUGH

201
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:34,858
IS NOW ON THE SUPREME COURT

202
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:36,159
BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE

203
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,028
SENATE VOTED FOR HIM AS THE

204
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,062
CONSTITUTION SUBSCRIBES BUT

205
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:40,363
WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING, HE

206
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:42,933
IS SAYING, THAT KAVANAUGH WAS

207
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:45,201
INSTALLED BY A RACIAL GROUP TO

208
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:46,503
DISEMPOWER EVERY OTHER RACIAL

209
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:47,504
GROUP IN AMERICA.

210
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:50,607
THIS IS TRIBAL WARFARE POSING

211
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,375
AS DEMOCRACY AND YOUR TRIBE IS

212
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:52,709
LOSING.

213
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,010
THAT IS WHAT HE IS TELLING

214
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:54,411
YOU.

215
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,012
AS A FACTUAL MATTER THIS IS

216
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:56,546
INSANE.

217
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:57,681
THE LUNACY THAT WOULD HAVE

218
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:59,449
GOTTEN YOU BOOTED OFF A CABLE

219
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,383
CHANNEL FIVE YEARS AGO.

220
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:01,785
IT'S ALSO A LIE AND IT'S

221
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:02,385
DANGEROUS.

222
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,721
IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF

223
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,490
THINGS THAT HUTU LEADERS IN

224
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:11,161
RWANDA SAID IN THE EARLY

00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:11,795
'90s.

226
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:13,597
RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE DON'T TALK

227
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:14,397
LIKE THIS.

228
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:15,532
SUDDENLY IT'S EVERYWHERE ON

229
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,099
THE LEFT.

230
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,834
NOT JUST THE WACKOS POUNDING

231
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,102
ON THE DOOR OF SUPREME COURT.

232
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:23,907
THE LINE BETWEEN DANGEROUS AND

233
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,609
THE DEMOCRATS ARE BLURRING ON

234
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,710
THE LEFT.

235
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:27,644

256
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:58,908
IT'S NORMAL NOW.

257
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,312
THE PRESS JUST APPLAUD IT.

258
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:04,080

A THOUSAND-YEAR REICH.

285
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,691
KEEP IN MIND HUNDREDS OF

00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:48,992
THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN MEN DIED

287
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:51,494
