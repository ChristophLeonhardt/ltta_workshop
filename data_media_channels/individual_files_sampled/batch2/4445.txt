this morning thousands of children that were taken from their parents that's exactly the question they're asking what is in store for them where are they going to go after the President did sign that executive order that ends the practice of separating families something his administration said only Congress can do and then the President did it this is a big positive for those who are trying to cross the border now they will hopefully not have to face this and they realize they're gonna have to face repercussions when you come in the country illegally you will be detained you will be arrested but now the idea that these families will stay together he's a relief it's a positive more than 2300 children they've already been separated and the order it's doing nothing to reunite them with their parents not even the intention there's no policy put in place it is an immense task now given that many of them as I just said they were on my plane yesterday they have been relocated to States as far away as Michigan Connecticut and right here in New York and sometimes without the knowledge of local officials and the rollout of this fix it seems nearly as confused as the policy itself after Health and Human Services spokesperson Ken Wolfe said the children already separated would not be reunited another official said Wolfe misspoke saying Rini reunification is always the goal I appreciate the spirit of that it's always the goal what I want to know is what is the procedure we'll be following it and the department is awaiting further guidance on that matter so for me the only guidance I got from the person in the White House who's focused on family issues and children which is Ivanka as she was thanking her dad for ending the policy the he put in place and said it's Congress has turned it's Congress's turn to do something but the job is not over in the executive branch again please Ivanka do something joining me now NBC News national correspondent Peter Alexander NBC News national security and justice reporter Julia Ainsley and Carlos Garcia an immigration attorney live in McAllen Texas okie-doke Peter I'm desperate to know this what exactly does this do for families who are already separated those kids in their mamas they don't have the bracelets on that your wife and I had when in the hospital having our babies to make sure we didn't leave the building without one another yes seven who said nothing the fact that many of those young children are not in positions to advocate for themselves remember some of them are under the age of four years old right now so the administration rolled out this policy now the tough task is trying to roll it back as it were to try to fix this diaspora of these young undocumented immigrants all over the country right now as you just indicated we've already heard from the HHS with the Health and Human Services Department right now effectively that they haven't received any additional guidance on this matter yet it is unclear how soon certainly not immediately that these families will be reunited they're obviously unique circumstances here that make this an even more complicated process than it already was at face value let me put up on your screen part of that executive order from the president yesterday and how it details some of the challenges here it says the Secretary of Homeland Security shall not however detain an alien family together when there is a concern that detention of an alien child with the child's alien parent would pose a risk to the child's welfare so on top of the fundamental challenge that exists right now of trying to put parents back together with their children are these unique circumstances as it relates to some of these children and certainly in some of these cases the children may have been brought here by those other than their parents at least according to the administration's happening okay Peter I want to walk through local officials it sounds like excuse me elected officials might be touring these centers it was very frustrating when we were down there we couldn't get in what do you know about that well what we do know at least one example was Senator Bill Nelson in Homestead Florida just a matter of days ago was trying to get into one of these detention centers where young people were being held in his home state he was unable to do it obviously was very frustrated by that he described it as a cover-up after he was denied access to this immigration center in Homestead Florida when they were holding more than a thousand migrant teenagers including 94 reportedly who were separated from their parents whether he's going to get to go in there at any point we do not know just yet that's obviously as you've indicated not the only sites where there have been problems and where officials have been away we've witnessed that playing out over the course of the last several days and on screen right now we're showing you some of the pictures in the video not independently shot by journalistic organizations but provided by health and human services provided by the Trump administration all the more reason why these lawmakers and journalists want access on their own to try to detail exactly what it looks like behind the scenes there's death ok Julia walk us through this you know when we say the President signed an executive order to end zero-tolerance you know it makes for a good headline but walk us through what it actually means because the wording is actually very vague and in the past when he signs these orders it doesn't end up meaning that there's action it really ends up meaning that they write reports that's true Stephanie and actually no matter what side of the immigration issue you land on this executive order is very vague in fact we've just gotten some reporting from Chris Hayes who's in touch with people in court in McAllen Texas who said that 17 immigrants came in today who were supposed to be charged in federal court as they would under the zero-tolerance policy with misdemeanors but they were not charged so they could be stay with their family that is not the zero-tolerance policy for the president to say he will continue zero tolerance but allow families to reunify you you can't have both of those things and so in fact they're throwing out those misdemeanors at least now at least in these 17 cases that Chris heard about today and part of that is just the technicalities if you charge someone in federal court you have to hold them in the custody of the US Marshals and you can't hold children there if you're gonna hold families together they'd be in family detention centers where often people are going through civil proceedings that would be getting an asylum claim or just simply getting an order of deportation so none of this makes sense I mean they're there from where the children are to where these people are going to stay we understand the Department of Defense is looking into places where families can stay - whether or not people will even be charged for crossing the border illegally as the president said they would be it all just seems to be floating in there right now Stephanie okay Carlos I want to stick sort of to what technically happens here because politics and an advocacy put all of that aside and let's go technical you were just in the federal court when the judge decided that those seventeen people would not be charged so they're not gonna be charged but for new migrants coming in what can they expect I have no idea well let me let me just clarify something I was in the courtroom the judge did not take the bench the the government attorneys were not inside the courtroom yet the federal public defenders got word that those seventeen people were not going to be charged likely from the from the AUSA is the government and those seventeen people were taking off the docket so there was no formal proceeding in their cases were dismissed now what comes next we don't know we don't know if now parents with children are going to continue being charged for illegal entry or what's going to happen these seventeen people whose cases were dismissed their children have already been taken away from them their children are nowhere to be found right now so we don't know the reunification process starts with them or it's gonna start later but their kids are gone okay okay but when you say their kids are gone let's just talk through the reunification process so President Trump says he wants to end zero tolerance we've got over 2,000 kids that are separated from their parents what is the procedure that happens now to reunite them Carlos so now they go through if if they're in Orr custody and if they're in the government's custody oh RR is office of refugee and resettlement and they're the ones that take care of the kids and and they have caseworkers and those case workers try to Reno file with an existing family member that may be in the United States if that's going to be possible because remember despite the fact that these parents have their criminal case dismissed that doesn't mean that the ice isn't going to pick them up and that they're not going to be transferred to I so we'll have to see wait and see what happens to these 17 people if they make an affirmative claim for asylum they might go through that process and just we understand one more time why would the parents have their criminal case dismissed if they did cross the border illegally and they were detained by border agents why is it being dismissed I don't I don't know I can't answer that question I think that question is better answered by by the government Julia I know government yeah it seems Stephanie that there's just confusion that these people down at the border are not understanding how they're supposed to interpret the executive order it's the same confusion through all of these agencies and we're seeing in the judicial branch as well I'm sure they're they'll want clarification but you would have thought that that would have already come and I stayed up all night waiting for statements from government agencies turning over resetting my alarm expecting there to be clarification we don't have those answers yet hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that
