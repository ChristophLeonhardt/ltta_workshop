SERGEANT MAJOR JOHN CANLEY WAS 
BORN IN ARKANSAS IN. 
IN 1953 AT THE AGE OF 15, JOHN 
USED HIS BROTHER'S PAPERWORK TO 
ENLIST IN THE UNITED STATES 
MARINES. 
JOHN, WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT, 
JOHN. 
JOHN SERVED IN SOUTH KOREA AND 
JAPAN BEFORE SHIPPING OUT TO 
VIETNAM FOR MORE THAN FIVE 
YEARS OF INTENSE COMBAT. 
ON JANUARY 30, 1968, VIETNAMESE 
FAMILIES GATHERED TO CELEBRATE 
THE LUNAR NEW YEAR. 
IN THE MIDST OF THE 
CELEBRATION, THOUSANDS OF NORTH 
VIETNAMESE COMMUNISTS LAUNCHED 
SURPRISE ATTACKS ALL OVER AND 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 
THIS BECAME KNOWN AS ONE OF THE 
LARGEST ENEMY OFFENSIVES THAT 
WE'VE EVER SEEN AND CERTAINLY 
OF THE VIETNAM WAR. 
WITHIN THE FIRST DAY THE 
COMMUNISTS SEIZED CONTROL OF 
HUE CITY. 
AT THE TIME JOHN WAS A GUNNERY 
SERGEANT. 
THIS COMPANY OF ROUGHLY 150 
MARINES WAS TASKED TO HELP TAKE 
BACK THE CITY. 
ON THEIR WAY THE ENEMY ATTACKED 
THEM WITH MACHINE GUNS, 
MORTARS, ROCKETS AND EVERYTHING 
ELSE THEY HAD. 
JOHN'S FRIEND PAT FRALEY WAS 
STRUCK BY A ROCKET EXPLOSION 
AND WAS ABOUT TO BE RUN OVER BY 
A TANK WHEN JOHN CHARGED 
THROUGH ENEMY FIRE AND CARRIED 
HIM BACK TO SAFETY. 
TODAY 50 YEARS LATER PAT IS 
HERE WITH US AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
TO HONOR THE HERO WHO SAVED HIS 
LIFE. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, PAT. 
WHERE'S PAT?
THAT'S GREAT, PAT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
I KNEW YOU'D HAVE NO PROBLEM 
GETTING UP. 
THAT'S GREATS. 
THANK YOU, PAT. 
EARLY IN THE BATTLE JOHN'S 
COMMANDING OFFICER WAS 
SERIOUSLY WOUNDED. 
COMMAND THEN FELL TO JOHN WHO 
QUICKLY ORGANIZED HIS MEN AND 
LED THEM THROUGH THE FIGHT. 
ONE OF HIS FELLOW WARRIORS WHO 
JOINS US TODAY SAID YOU 
FOLLOWED HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A 
TRUE LEADER. 
HE WAS TOTALLY FEARLESS. 
HE LOVED HIS MARINES AND WE 
LOVED HIM BACK. 
WHERE IS JOHN? 
WHERE ARE YOU, JOHN? 
STAND UP, JOHN. 
BEAUTIFUL. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING 
HERE. 
BY THE END OF THE DAY JOHN AND 
HIS COMPANY OF LESS THAN 150 
MARINES HAD SUCCESFULLY PUSHED 
INTO THE CITY, WHICH WAS HELD 
BY 6000, AT LEAST, COMMUNIST 
FIGHTERS. 
IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED JOHN 
LED HIS COMPANY THROUGH THE FOG 
AND RAIN AND IN HOUSE TO HOUSE, 
VERY VICIOUS, VERY HARD COMBAT. 
HE ASSAULTED ENEMY STRONGHOLDS, 
KILLED ENEMY FIGHTERS AND WITH 
DEADLY ACCURACY DID EVERYTHING 
YOU HAD TO DO. 
HE RACED INTO HEAVY MACHINE 
GUNFIRE ON MANY OCCASIONS ALL 
TO SAVE HIS FELLOW MARINES. 
IN ONE HARROWING ENGAGEMENT 
AFTER ANOTHER JOHN RISKED HIS 
OWN LIFE TO SAVE THE LIVES OF 
THOSE UNDER HIS COMMAND. 
DURING THE FIFTH DAY OF COMBAT 
JOHN AND HIS COMPANY WERE 
TASKED WITH LIBERATING THE JOAN 
OF ARK SCHOOL, WHICH HAD BECOME 
A STRATEGIC AND SYMBOLIC 
STRONGHOLD OF THE COMMUNIST 
CONTROL OF THE CITY. 
AS SOON AS JOHN'S COMPANY 
ARRIVED, COMMUNIST FORCES 
UNLEASHED THEIR MACHINE GUNS 
WITH TREMENDOUS VELOCITY, 
TREMENDOUS VIOLENCE, ALL AT THE 
MARINES. 
UNDETERRED JOHN AND HIS COMRADE 
SERGEANT ALFREDO GONZALEZ 
FEARLESSLY CHARGED FORWARD WITH 
ROCKET LAUNCHERS KILLING THE 
ENEMY AND DRIVING THEM FROM 
THEIR POSITIONS. 
THE ENEMY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE 
HAPPENED. 
DURING THIS DARING MANEUVER 
SERGEANT GONZALEZ WAS SHOT AND 
KILLED, GIVING HIS LIFE FOR HIS 
NATION AND FOR HIS FELLOW 
MARINES. 
TODAY WE ARE HONORED TO BE 
JOINED BIZARRE GENT GONZALEZ' 
MOTHER WHO I JUST MET, WHO IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
MARIA. 
WHERE'S MARIA? 
THERE'S MARIA.
THANK YOU, MARIA.

GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR SON, YOU 
KNOW THAT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MURPHY, WHOSE BROTHER WALTER 
DIED FIGHTING COURAGEOUSLY IN 
THE BATTLE OF HUE CITY. 
AND HENRY, WHERE ARE YOU, 
HENRY? 
PLEASE, STAND UP.

AS THE BATTLE RAGED ON SERGEANT 
MAJOR JOHN CANLEY FOUGHT HIS 
WAY INSIDE THE JOAN OF ARK 
SCHOOL. 
THERE HE AND HIS FELLOW MARINES 
WENT ROOM TO ROOM IN BRUTAL 
CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT. 
JOHN RACED STRAIGHT INTO ENEMY 
FIRE OVER AND OVER AGAIN SAVING 
NUMEROUS AMERICAN LIVES AND 
DEFEATING A LARGE GROUP OF 
COMMUNIST FIGHTERS. 
AFTER AN INTENSE DAY OF 
FIGHTING, JOHN AND HIS FELLOW 
MARINES LIBERATED THE SCHOOL. 
JOHN WASN'T DONE YET. 
DESPITE SUSTAINING SERIOUS 
INJURIES, VERY, VERY SERIOUS 
INJURIES HE CONTINUED TO FACE 
DOWN THE ENEMY WITH NO THOUGHT 
FOR HIS OWN SAFETY. 
SEVEN STRAIGHT DAYS OF 
UNRELENTING COMBAT. 
SAVING THE LIVES OF MORE THAN 
20 MARINES. 
BY THE BATTLE'S END, AMERICAN 
MARINES HAD DEFEATED THE 
COMMUNISTS AND TAKEN BACK THE 
CITY. 
TODAY WE ARE JOINED BY MORE 
THAN 30 OF THE BRAVE MARINES 
WHO FOUGHT WITH VALOR IN THE 
BATTLE OF HUE CITY. 
WOULD YOU PLEASE STAND.
