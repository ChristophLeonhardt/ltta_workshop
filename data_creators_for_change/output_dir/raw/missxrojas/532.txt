romanticism and tablet and bore

48
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,540
literature philosophy dare I say it the

49
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,090
tricky ins and outs of political

50
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,380
philosophy so I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that as well</font>

51
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,930
