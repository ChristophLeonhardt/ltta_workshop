1
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,692
WE ARE LIVE FROM SINGAPORE WHERE

2
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:33,126
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 

3
01:40:33,126 --> 01:40:33,827
BECOME THE FIRST AMERICAN 

4
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:35,462
PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH A 

5
01:40:35,462 --> 01:40:36,497
DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA.

6
01:40:36,497 --> 01:40:39,299
IT IS A MOMENT RICH WITH 

7
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:40,100
OPPORTUNITY AND RISK.

8
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,502
SUCCESS HERE COULD REDUCE THE 

9
01:40:42,502 --> 01:40:44,070
RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR, USHER IN A 

10
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:47,174
NEW ERA OF PEACE.

11
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:48,575
MILITARY ACTION, CATASTROPHIC 

12
01:40:48,575 --> 01:40:49,643
CONFLICT WITH U.S. TROOPS RIGHT 

13
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:50,844
ON THE FRONT LINE.

14
01:40:50,844 --> 01:41:19,439
THAT IS WHERE DELEGATIONS.

15
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:21,642
SUPPOSED TO LAST MOST OF THE 

16
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:23,310
DAY, BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 

17
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:24,210
KIM EXPECTED TO LEAVE SINGAPORE 

18
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:25,546
BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY RIGHT 

19
01:41:25,546 --> 01:41:26,480
NOW.

20
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,181
JONATHAN KARL IS WITH OUR WHITE 

21
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:29,816
HOUSE DELEGATION.

22
01:41:29,816 --> 01:41:31,051
JON, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE'LL 

23
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:32,152
KNOW IN THE FIRST MINUTE WHETHER

24
01:41:32,152 --> 01:41:34,922
HE CAN WORK WITH KIM.

25
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,089
>> Reporter: HE ALSO SAYS HE HAS

26
01:41:36,089 --> 01:41:37,824
BEEN PREPARING, GEORGE, HIS 

27
01:41:37,824 --> 01:41:39,359
WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS MOMENT.

28
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:41,995
BUT THIS HAS BEEN A PROCESS.

29
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:43,263
THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN 

30
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,864
DRIVEN BY THE PRESIDENT, BY A 

31
01:41:44,864 --> 01:41:47,367
PRESIDENT ACTING ON HIS OWN 

32
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:48,268
INSTINCT AND OWN COUNSEL.

33
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:50,103
A PRESIDENT WHO ACCEPTED THIS 

34
01:41:50,103 --> 01:41:51,705
INVITATION FROM KIM JONG-UN IN 

35
01:41:51,705 --> 01:41:52,972
AN INSTANT.

36
01:41:52,972 --> 01:41:55,408
AND THAT COUNSEL, HIS OWN 

37
01:41:55,408 --> 01:41:57,678
COUNSEL, WILL BE DRIVING THIS 

38
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:58,945
MOMENT TODAY AS YOU POINT OUT, 

39
01:41:58,945 --> 01:42:00,447
GEORGE, THE FIRST MEETING, 

40
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:01,915
EXTRAORDINARY IN SO MANY WAYS, 

41
01:42:01,915 --> 01:42:03,717
INCLUDING THE FACT IT WILL JUST 

42
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:06,353
BE THOSE TWO MEN, KIM JONG-UN, 

43
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:09,222
DONALD TRUMP AND THE 

44
01:42:09,222 --> 01:42:09,523
TRANSLATORS.

45
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,158
>> TRYING TO GET A FEEL FOR EACH

46
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:13,627
OTHER, SEE IF A PEACE CAN BE 

47
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:13,961
FORGED.

48
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,629
65 YEARS SINCE THE CEASE FIRE 

49
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,163
THAT ENDED THE FIGHTING IN THE 

50
01:42:17,163 --> 01:42:19,266
KOREAN WAR, FIRST THERE'S BEEN 

51
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:21,268
NO PEACE TREATY.

52
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:22,870
JOINED BY MARTHA RADDATZ.

53
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:24,838
THE BIG QUESTION ON THE TABLE IS

54
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:26,273
NORTH KOREA WILLING TO GIVE UP 

55
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:28,275
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WHAT CAN 

56
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:29,709
PRESIDENT TRUMP OFFER KIM TO 

57
01:42:29,709 --> 01:42:31,178
CONVINCE HIM HE DOESN'T NEED 

58
01:42:31,178 --> 01:42:31,378
THEM?

59
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:33,213
>> WELL, WE KNOW THAT KIM 

60
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:35,015
JONG-UN HAS SAID HE WILL TALK 

61
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:36,215
ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION.

62
01:42:36,215 --> 01:42:38,719
HE WILL DISCUSS THAT OR WE 

63
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:39,653
WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY.

64
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:40,587
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THAT VERY 

65
01:42:40,587 --> 01:42:42,556
CLEAR, THAT HAS TO BE ON THE 

66
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:42,756
TABLE.

67
01:42:42,756 --> 01:42:44,825
MOST EXPERTS, MOST FORMER 

68
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:46,092
OFFICIALS WILL TELL YOU HE WILL 

69
01:42:46,092 --> 01:42:48,128
NEVER GIVE UP THOSE WEAPONS.

70
01:42:48,128 --> 01:42:50,063
BUT I THINK IF YOU READ THE 

71
01:42:50,063 --> 01:42:51,464
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ABOUT THAT, 

72
01:42:51,464 --> 01:42:52,899
MAYBE KIM DOES WANT TO COME INTO

73
01:42:52,899 --> 01:42:54,534
THE MODERN WORLD.

74
01:42:54,534 --> 01:42:56,436
MAYBE HE DOES WANT HIS ECONOMY 

75
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:57,271
TO IMPROVE.

76
01:42:57,271 --> 01:42:59,239
WHAT HE DOES WANT IS MORE 

77
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:01,942
MEETINGS THAN JUST THIS ONE.

78
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:03,209
BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 

79
01:43:03,209 --> 01:43:04,377
WANT MORE MEETINGS.

80
01:43:04,377 --> 01:43:06,647
THEY SAY THIS IS A PROCESS.

81
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:08,782
KIM OBVIOUSLY IF HE DECIDES TO 

82
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:10,316
DENUCLEARIZE IT WILL TAKE A 

83
01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:10,517
WHILE.

84
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:11,418
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL 

85
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:13,220
NOT KNOW THE RESULTS OF FOR A 

86
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,754
LONG TIME.

87
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:17,791
BUT WHAT HE WANTS IN EXCHANGE IS

88
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:19,326
SECURITY WITHOUT WEAPONS IF IT 

89
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:19,960
COMES TO THAT. 

90
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,362
>> THIS COULD TAKE MONTHS AND 

91
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:22,829
YEARS.

92
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:24,331
DAVID MUIR ALSO HERE.

93
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:26,099
WE KNOW THAT, DAVID, NUCLEAR 

94
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:27,234
WEAPONS ARE WHAT GOT KIM HERE 

95
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:27,668
TODAY.

96
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:29,102
AND HE'S ALREADY ACHIEVED WHAT 

97
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:31,505
HIS FATHER, WHAT HIS GRANDFATHER

98
01:43:31,505 --> 01:43:32,338
COULDN'T, SHARING A STAGE WITH 

99
01:43:32,338 --> 01:43:33,307
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.

100
01:43:33,307 --> 01:43:33,974
>> NO QUESTION, GEORGE.

101
01:43:33,974 --> 01:43:37,010
AND THE NUMBERS WHEN IT COME TO 

102
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,145
THAT NUCLEAR ARSENAL JUST 

103
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:38,412
STUNNING.

104
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:40,147
UNDER KIM JONG-UN, THEY LAUNCHED

105
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:42,416
MORE BALLISTIC MISSILES THAN HIS

106
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:44,117
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER COMBINED.

107
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:45,051
FOUR OF THE SIX NUCLEAR TESTS 

108
01:43:45,051 --> 01:43:47,020
HAVE HAPPENED UNDER KIM JONG-UN,

109
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,323
THAT HYDROGEN EXPLOSION JUST A 

110
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:51,258
FEW MONTHS BACK BELIEVED TO BE 

111
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:52,559
LARGER THAN HIROSHIMA.

112
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:54,928
GEORGE, AS YOU POINT OUT, MANY 

113
01:43:54,928 --> 01:43:59,599
OBSERVERS SAY THE FIRST VICTORY 

114
01:43:59,599 --> 01:44:00,800
FOR KIM JUONG-UN IS APPEARING I 

115
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,869
MOMENTS HERE, THE LEADER OF THE 

116
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:04,404
FREE WORLD THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

117
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:05,072
UNITED STATES.

118
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:08,708
>> THEY'RE ABOUT TO COME OUT 

119
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:09,509
RIGHT NOW.

120
01:44:09,509 --> 01:44:11,177
WE EXPECT TO SEE KIM JONG-UN, 

121
01:44:11,177 --> 01:44:13,413
BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND KIM 

122
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:14,214
JONG-UN ARE THERE.

123
01:44:14,214 --> 01:44:15,682
THEY WILL BE WALKING FROM 

124
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:16,616
OPPOSITE SIDES.

125
01:44:16,616 --> 01:44:18,284
AS WE SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

126
01:44:18,284 --> 01:44:21,821
GETTING PREPARED TO WALK TO 

127
01:44:21,821 --> 01:44:23,957
CENTER STAGE.

128
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:25,092
AND THERE IT IS.

129
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:26,760
THE FIRSTHAND SHAKE BETWEEN THE 

130
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,394
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND 

131
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:30,964
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR, DONALD 

132
01:44:30,964 --> 01:44:32,165
TRUMP, KIM JONG-UN.

133
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:38,105
65 YEARS IN THE MAKING.

134
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:39,473
WE CAN'T READ EXACTLY WHAT 

135
01:44:39,473 --> 01:44:41,641
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SAYING TO 

136
01:44:41,641 --> 01:44:42,209
KIM JONG-UN THERE.

137
01:44:42,209 --> 01:44:43,943
BUT HE IS NOW FACING THE 

138
01:44:43,943 --> 01:44:44,177
CAMERAS.

139
01:44:44,177 --> 01:44:46,613
NO SMILES FROM EITHER MEN.

140
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:50,117
BUT A THANK YOU FROM PRESIDENT 

141
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:50,350
TRUMP.

142
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:52,486
AND THEY WILL NOW GO BEHIND 

143
01:44:52,486 --> 01:44:54,220
CLOSED DOORS FOR THAT ONE-ON-ONE

144
01:44:54,220 --> 01:45:00,594
MEETING WITH TRANSLATORS.

145
01:45:00,594 --> 01:45:04,997
SOME SMILES NOW THAT THEY'RE IN 

146
01:45:04,997 --> 01:45:09,202
THE CORRIDOR.

147
01:45:09,202 --> 01:45:10,937
THE FIRST GREETING BETWEEN THE 

148
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:12,239
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND 

149
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:21,081
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR.

150
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:22,415
THEY'RE GETTING STARTED BEFORE 

151
01:45:22,415 --> 01:45:26,319
THEY GO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, 

152
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:26,753
JONATHAN KARL.

153
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:27,721
>> Reporter: UNBELIEVABLE 

154
01:45:27,721 --> 01:45:30,557
MOMENT, GEORGE.

155
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:34,628
I MEAN, JUST -- TO LOOK AT THOSE

156
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:37,397
TWO INDIVIDUALS, TWO OF THE MOST

157
01:45:37,397 --> 01:45:41,701
UNPREDICTABLE LEADERS IN THE 

158
01:45:41,701 --> 01:45:42,401
WORLD, STANDING TOGETHER OVER 

159
01:45:42,401 --> 01:45:44,371
THE MOST OF THE PAST YEAR, 

160
01:45:44,371 --> 01:45:47,707
GEORGE, THE CONVERSATION BACK 

161
01:45:47,707 --> 01:45:49,376
AND FORTH WAS TAUNTING, WAS 

162
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:52,045
PERSONAL INSULTS, WAS TALK OF 

163
01:45:52,045 --> 01:45:52,446
WAR.

164
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:55,282
AND THERE YOU SEE GETTING -- I 

165
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:56,182
THINK WHAT WE JUST SAW -- 

166
01:45:56,182 --> 01:45:59,652
>> THE CAMERAS ARE GETTING 

167
01:45:59,652 --> 01:46:03,723
TOGETHER TO GO INSIDE, JON.

168
01:46:03,723 --> 01:46:04,558
>> YEAH.

169
01:46:04,558 --> 01:46:05,892
THAT WAS TIGHTLY CHOREOGRAPHED.

170
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:07,928
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN

171
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:09,128
WHEN THEY GET BEHIND CLOSED 

172
01:46:09,128 --> 01:46:09,362
DOORS.

173
01:46:09,362 --> 01:46:10,864
WE'LL SEE A MINUTE OF THAT.

174
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:12,265
DAVID MUIR, LET ME BRING YOU IN.

175
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:13,666
THEY BOTH KEPT ON THEIR GAME 

176
01:46:13,666 --> 01:46:15,068
FACES BEFORE THE CAMERAS.

177
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:16,503
WHEN THEY GOT BEHIND THAT 

178
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:18,038
PILLAR, YOU SAW THEM BOTH BREAK 

179
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:18,371
INTO SMILES. 

180
01:46:18,371 --> 01:46:19,772
>> INTO SMILES WITH THE WORLD 

181
01:46:19,772 --> 01:46:20,039
WATCHING.

182
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:24,411
I'M SO CURIOUS, GEORGE, HOW MUCH

183
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:25,511
ENGLISH KIM JONG-UN UNDERSTANDS.

184
01:46:25,511 --> 01:46:29,716
HE WAS EDUCATED IN SWITZERLAND.

185
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:33,520
A LOVER OF WRN CULTURES, MOVIES,

186
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,054
AMERICAN BASKETBALL.

187
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:36,456
WE DO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT AND 

188
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:37,491
KIM JONG-UN WILL BE IN THIS ROOM

189
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:38,758
ALONE WITH ONLY THEIR 

190
01:46:38,758 --> 01:46:39,793
TRANSLATORS FOR AT LEAST THE 

191
01:46:39,793 --> 01:46:40,327
FIRST MEETING HERE.

192
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:42,596
GOOD PART OF THAT FIRST MEETING.

193
01:46:42,596 --> 01:46:44,264
AND WHAT'S UNCLEAR IS HOW MUCH 

194
01:46:44,264 --> 01:46:46,466
THEY'LL BE ACTUALLY SPEAKING IN 

195
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:47,534
ENGLISH, KIM JONG-UN WILL 

196
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:48,601
UNDERSTAND AND PERHAPS IT WILL 

197
01:46:48,601 --> 01:46:51,838
OFFER SOME ENGLISH IN RETURN. 

198
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:55,175
>> MARTHA RADDATZ, UP UNTIL THE 

199
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:56,977
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THE AMERICAN

200
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:59,813
WHO KNEW HIM BEST DENNIS RODMAN.

201
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:01,514
MIKE POMPEO HAS MET WITH HIM 

202
01:47:01,514 --> 01:47:02,582
LEADING UP TO THIS MEETING.

203
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:03,550
WE BELIEVE BUT DON'T KNOW FOR 

204
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:04,951
SURE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKELY

205
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:06,386
TALKED TO HIM OVER THE PHONE BUT

206
01:47:06,386 --> 01:47:07,654
OF COURSE THIS IS THE FIRST FACE

207
01:47:07,654 --> 01:47:08,321
TO FACE. 

208
01:47:08,321 --> 01:47:09,055
>> EXACTLY.

209
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:10,190
AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

210
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:12,492
I THINK OF THE THREE OF US IN SO

211
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:13,426
MANY TIMES IN THE LAST FEW 

212
01:47:13,426 --> 01:47:15,762
MONTHS TALKING ABOUT THE 

213
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:16,930
POSSIBILITY OF WAR AND BEING ON 

214
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:19,866
THAT BORDER, THAT DMZ, MYSELF A 

215
01:47:19,866 --> 01:47:21,901
FEW MONTHS AGO, AND REALIZING 

216
01:47:21,901 --> 01:47:23,503
THAT THESE ARE TWO NATIONS THAT 

217
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:26,072
COULD GO TO WAR AND THE MILITARY

218
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:26,940
IS PREPARING FOR THAT.

219
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,408
>> YOU SEE THE HAND ON THE 

220
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:29,108
SHOULDER THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 

221
01:47:29,108 --> 01:47:30,911
PUT ON KIM JONG-UN.

222
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:31,611
IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY. 

223
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:32,411
>> AND THE WORDS THAT PRESIDENT 

224
01:47:32,411 --> 01:47:35,515
TRUMP HAS USED TO DESCRIBE KIM 

225
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:36,782
JONG-UN, KIM JONG-UN USED TO 

226
01:47:36,782 --> 01:47:37,950
DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENT, 

227
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:38,919
OBVIOUSLY A HUGE CHANGE IN 

228
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,119
ATTITUDE, AT LEAST AT THE 

229
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:41,121
BEGINNING OF THIS MEETING.

230
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:42,489
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S 

231
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:43,389
GOING TO HAPPEN ONCE THEY GET 

232
01:47:43,389 --> 01:47:44,390
BEHIND THOSE DOORS.

233
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:46,626
BUT MARTHA, YOU JUST MADE THE 

234
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:48,261
POINT, ESPECIALLY AFTER THOSE 

235
01:47:48,261 --> 01:47:49,862
FIRST TESTS AND THOSE THREATS 

236
01:47:49,862 --> 01:47:52,231
FROM KIM JONG-UN, THE MILITARY 

237
01:47:52,231 --> 01:47:54,634
WAS POISED FOR POSSIBLE MILITARY

238
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:54,867
ACTION.

239
01:47:54,867 --> 01:47:56,570
NO ONE WAS SURE IT WOULDN'T 

240
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:56,770
COME. 

241
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:57,204
>> ABSOLUTELY.

242
01:47:57,204 --> 01:47:59,238
AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS 

243
01:47:59,238 --> 01:48:01,040
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MUCH IS 

244
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,810
THAT KIM JONG-UN REALLY STOPPED 

245
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:04,644
BEFORE THE U.S. MILITARY -- 

246
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:06,546
>> CAMERAS NOW INSIDE THE ROOM 

247
01:48:06,546 --> 01:48:08,582
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND KIM 

248
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:11,551
JONG-UN.

249
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:24,798
LET'S LISTEN IN.

250
01:48:24,798 --> 01:48:26,533
>> I FEEL REALLY GREAT.

251
01:48:26,533 --> 01:48:29,168
WE'LL HAVE A GREAT DISCUSSION.

252
01:48:29,168 --> 01:48:31,705
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.

253
01:48:31,705 --> 01:48:33,940
THIS WILL BE TREMENDOUSLY 

254
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:34,240
SUCCESSFUL.

255
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:34,774
IT'S MY HONOR.

256
01:48:34,774 --> 01:48:36,109
WE WILL HAVE A TERRIFIC 

257
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:52,259
RELATIONSHIP.

258
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,366
I HAVE NO DOUBT.

259
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:15,448
[ SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ]

260
01:49:15,448 --> 01:49:20,886
>> Translator: LOOK AT OBSTACLES

261
01:49:20,886 --> 01:49:22,288
IN OUR WAY FORWARD, BUT WE 

262
01:49:22,288 --> 01:49:26,826
OVERCAME ALL OF THEM AND WE ARE 

263
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:31,431
HERE TODAY.

264
01:49:31,431 --> 01:49:32,399
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

265
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,033
>> THANK YOU.

266
01:49:33,033 --> 01:49:34,567
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

267
01:49:34,567 --> 01:49:36,102
>> AND ANOTHER HANDSHAKE THERE 

268
01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:42,142
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 

269
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:43,543
JONG-UN.

270
01:49:43,543 --> 01:49:59,625
PRESIDENT TRUMP -- 

271
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:01,995
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

272
01:50:01,995 --> 01:50:03,063
LET'S GO.

273
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:04,731
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE PRESS

274
01:50:04,731 --> 01:50:05,899
RIGHT THERE SAYS HE EXPECTS A 

275
01:50:05,899 --> 01:50:07,033
VERY GOOD MEETING.

276
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:09,002
HOPING FOR SUCCESS.

277
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:10,103
KIM JONG-UN SAYING THEY'VE 

278
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:14,541
OVERCOME OBSTACLES TO GET HERE.

279
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:17,243
LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT THE DAY 

280
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:18,611
CAN BRING.

281
01:50:18,611 --> 01:50:22,481
YOU MADE THE POINT KIM JONG-UN 

282
01:50:22,481 --> 01:50:24,317
GROOMED IN SWITZERLAND FOR 

283
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:25,418
LEADERSHIP, PICKED BY HIS FATHER

284
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:27,653
TO BECOME HIS SUCCESSOR.

285
01:50:27,653 --> 01:50:29,222
IT WAS SUCH A MYSTERY TO MOST OF

286
01:50:29,222 --> 01:50:29,989
THE WORLD.

287
01:50:29,989 --> 01:50:31,224
>> WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT HIM.

288
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:33,526
IN FACT, IT WAS THE PRESIDENT, 

289
01:50:33,526 --> 01:50:34,827
GEORGE, AS YOU'LL RECALL A FEW 

290
01:50:34,827 --> 01:50:36,496
WEEKS BACK SAYING HE WAS JUST 27

291
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:38,131
YEARS OLD WHEN HE TOOK OVER THE 

292
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:39,766
REGIME, WHEN HIS FATHER DIED.

293
01:50:39,766 --> 01:50:42,268
THE PRESIDENT SAYING SAY WHAT 

294
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:42,902
YOU WANT, BUT THAT'S NOT EASY 

295
01:50:42,902 --> 01:50:43,736
ESPECIALLY AT THAT AGE.

296
01:50:43,736 --> 01:50:45,238
I'M NOT GIVING HIM CREDIT OR NOT

297
01:50:45,238 --> 01:50:46,005
GIVING HIM CREDIT.

298
01:50:46,005 --> 01:50:47,306
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S A VERY HARD

299
01:50:47,306 --> 01:50:48,041
THING TO DO.

300
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,408
A MOMENT OF RESPECT FROM THE 

301
01:50:49,408 --> 01:50:50,910
PRESIDENT FOR THAT LEADER.

302
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:52,145
BUT KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS A 

303
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,179
BRUTAL DICTATOR.

304
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:55,915
HE KILLED HIS UNCLE, HIS TRUSTED

305
01:50:55,915 --> 01:50:57,850
UNCLE WHEN HE BELIEVE THE UNCLE 

306
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:01,154
PLOTTED A COUP.

307
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:01,721
IT'S WIDELY BELIEVE HE WAS 

308
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:03,156
BEHIND THE ASSASSINATION BEHIND 

309
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:04,557
HIS HALF BROTHER, THE NERVE 

310
01:51:04,557 --> 01:51:06,126
AGENT ADMINISTERED BY THE TWO 

311
01:51:06,126 --> 01:51:06,326
WOMEN.

312
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:07,560
AND OF COURSE MILLIONS OF NORTH 

313
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,162
KOREANS BACK HOME THAT HAVE 

314
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:10,997
FACED STARVATION, GEORGE, FOOD 

315
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:12,165
SHORTAGES AND THOSE ROLLING 

316
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:12,432
BLACKOUTS.

317
01:51:12,432 --> 01:51:14,901
THE FACT THAT HE'S SITTING HERE 

318
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:15,534
BESIDE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

319
01:51:15,534 --> 01:51:17,103
UNITED STATES, THE LEADER OF THE

320
01:51:17,103 --> 01:51:18,471
FREE WORLD IS HISTORIC FOR HIM 

321
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:19,505
AND A VICTORY ALREADY. 

322
01:51:19,505 --> 01:51:23,476
>> ONE OF THE QUESTIONS, MARTHA 

323
01:51:23,476 --> 01:51:24,143
RADDATZ, HOW MUCH THE PRESIDENT 

324
01:51:24,143 --> 01:51:26,379
WILL BRING UP, HOW MUCH HE WILL 

325
01:51:26,379 --> 01:51:29,081
CONFRONT KIM JONG-UN ON ISSUES 

326
01:51:29,081 --> 01:51:30,183
BEYOND THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM?

327
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:31,484
>> THERE'S CALLS FOR HIM TO DO 

328
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:34,353
THAT, ADDRESS THE HUMAN RIGHTS 

329
01:51:34,353 --> 01:51:35,288
ISSUES IN A BIG WAY.

330
01:51:35,288 --> 01:51:36,255
PRESIDENT TRUMP, OF COURSE, 

331
01:51:36,255 --> 01:51:37,657
WANTS THIS TO BE A SUCCESSFUL 

332
01:51:37,657 --> 01:51:37,890
MEETING.

333
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:39,959
YOU HEARD HIM SAY, I THINK IT 

334
01:51:39,959 --> 01:51:40,693
WILL BE TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL,

335
01:51:40,693 --> 01:51:43,696
AND IT IS MY HONOR TO MEET KIM 

336
01:51:43,696 --> 01:51:44,197
JONG-UN.

337
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:46,432
THAT CERTAINLY STOOD OUT IN HIS 

338
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:46,665
REMARKS.

339
01:51:46,665 --> 01:51:49,102
THEY'RE OFF TO A FRIENDLY START.

340
01:51:49,102 --> 01:51:51,337
SO FAR THEY'VE GONE MORE THAN A 

341
01:51:51,337 --> 01:51:52,205
MINUTE FOR SURE.

342
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:53,773
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WOULD 

343
01:51:53,773 --> 01:51:54,974
KNOW WITHIN A MINUTE WHETHER HE 

344
01:51:54,974 --> 01:51:56,509
THOUGHT THE MEETING WOULD BE 

345
01:51:56,509 --> 01:51:56,809
SUCCESSFUL.

346
01:51:56,809 --> 01:51:57,977
IT TOOK ABOUT A MINUTE AND A 

347
01:51:57,977 --> 01:51:59,612
HALF BEFORE HE SAID HE THOUGHT 

348
01:51:59,612 --> 01:52:00,814
IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY 

349
01:52:00,814 --> 01:52:01,114
SUCCESSFUL.

350
01:52:01,114 --> 01:52:02,448
SO LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT WE WERE

351
01:52:02,448 --> 01:52:04,317
SAYING A LITTLE BIT BEFORE, 

352
01:52:04,317 --> 01:52:05,451
GEORGE, AND THE MILITARY 

353
01:52:05,451 --> 01:52:06,319
CONFRONTATION THAT WE THOUGHT 

354
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:07,854
WAS SO REAL.

355
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:09,455
OUR U.S. MILITARY WAS PRACTICING

356
01:52:09,455 --> 01:52:14,360
ALL THE TIME FOR WHAT MAY COME, 

357
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,197
IF KIM JONG-UN DECIDED TO DO AN 

358
01:52:17,197 --> 01:52:18,097
ATMOSPHERIC TEST, WE WOULD HAVE 

359
01:52:18,097 --> 01:52:19,765
TO STOP THAT IN SOME WAY OR 

360
01:52:19,765 --> 01:52:21,868
RESPOND IN SOME WAY.

361
01:52:21,868 --> 01:52:22,935
KIM JONG-UN DECIDED NOT TO GO 

362
01:52:22,935 --> 01:52:26,105
FORWARD BECAUSE HE ALREADY -- 

363
01:52:26,105 --> 01:52:27,607
COULD VERY QUICKLY GAIN THE 

364
01:52:27,607 --> 01:52:29,675
ABILITY TO PUT A NUCLEAR WARHEAD

365
01:52:29,675 --> 01:52:31,177
ON A MISSILE.

366
01:52:31,177 --> 01:52:33,279
>> OF COURSE, IF THIS MEETING 

367
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:34,913
FAILS, THAT PROSPECT OF MILITARY

368
01:52:34,913 --> 01:52:36,782
ACTION COULD COME TO THE FLOOR, 

369
01:52:36,782 --> 01:52:38,685
AGAIN BUT FOR NOW, WE'VE SEEN 

370
01:52:38,685 --> 01:52:39,585
HANDSHAKES, WE'VE SEEN SMILES 

371

TAKING PART IN ANYTHING THAT'S 

753
06:29:14,664 --> 06:29:15,865

BUT ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS 

795
06:30:34,310 --> 06:30:34,944
QUESTION, IF YOU THINK BACK TO

06:30:34,944 --> 06:30:38,815

THE PRESIDENT IN THAT SPEECH 

804
06:30:52,161 --> 06:30:53,896
SAID -- AND THIS IS AN EXACT 

805
06:30:53,896 --> 06:30:59,068
QUOTE -- NO REGIME HAS OPPRESSED

806
06:30:59,068 --> 06:31:00,537
ITS OWN CITIZENS MORE TOTALLY OR

807
06:31:00,537 --> 06:31:02,638
BRUTALLY THAN THE CRUEL 

808
06:31:02,638 --> 06:31:03,673
DICTATORSHIP IN NORTH KOREA.

ISSUE, WOULD NOT BE ABOUT HUMAN 

816
06:31:20,456 --> 06:31:20,689
RIGHTS.

817
06:31:20,689 --> 06:31:22,158

06:41:24,693 --> 06:41:24,960
PICTURES.

929
06:41:24,960 --> 06:41:26,362
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT

930
06:41:26,362 --> 06:41:28,130
IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT LETTER THAT

931
06:41:28,130 --> 06:41:29,632
THEY SIGNED SAYS.

932
06:41:29,632 --> 06:41:30,965
WE DO KNOW FROM WHAT HE SAID, 

933
06:41:30,965 --> 06:41:32,667
THEY HAVE AN EXCELLENT 

934
06:41:32,667 --> 06:41:34,269
RELATIONSHIP, SO IF YOU THINK 

935
06:41:34,269 --> 06:41:36,539
BACK BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME

936
06:41:36,539 --> 06:41:39,675
HERE, HE SAID THE LEAST WE CAN 

937
06:41:39,675 --> 06:41:40,976
ACCOMPLISH IS MEET, SEE EACH 

938
06:41:40,976 --> 06:41:43,011
OTHER AND HOPEFULLY LIKE EACH 

939
06:41:43,011 --> 06:41:43,279
OTHER.

940
06:41:43,279 --> 06:41:45,147
THAT, THEY GOT FOR SURE.

941
06:41:45,147 --> 06:41:46,848
BUT THEY CLEARLY ALLUDED TO THE 

942
06:41:46,848 --> 06:41:48,350
FACT THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE 

943
06:41:48,350 --> 06:41:49,317
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

944
06:41:49,317 --> 06:41:50,920
HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE

945
06:41:50,920 --> 06:41:52,454
OF A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.

946
06:41:52,454 --> 06:41:54,256
DIDN'T SAY HOW, DIDN'T LAY OUT 

947
06:41:54,256 --> 06:41:56,492
ANYTHING.

948
06:41:56,492 --> 06:42:00,729
BUT THE KEY TO ME IS WHEN 

949
06:42:00,729 --> 06:42:01,497
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE VERY END 

950
06:42:01,497 --> 06:42:03,432
WHEN HE WALKED AWAY THERE WAS 

951
06:42:03,432 --> 06:42:04,833
ASKED ABOUT OTHER MEETINGS.

952
06:42:04,833 --> 06:42:06,802
AND HE SAID THERE WILL BE MANY 

953
06:42:06,802 --> 06:42:07,002
MORE.

954
06:42:07,002 --> 06:42:08,704
THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT THEY 

955
06:42:08,704 --> 06:42:10,472
WANTED, A PROCESS, THAT'S WHAT 

956
06:42:10,472 --> 06:42:11,674
KIM JONG UN WANTED.

957
06:42:11,674 --> 06:42:13,208
SO WE WILL SEE IF THEY SAY 

958
06:42:13,208 --> 06:42:14,409
ANYTHING ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION,

959
06:42:14,409 --> 06:42:15,978
BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 

960
06:42:15,978 --> 06:42:17,045
GET REAL SPECIFIC THERE IF THEY 

961
06:42:17,045 --> 06:42:18,447
HAVE MORE MEETINGS TO COME.

962
06:42:18,447 --> 06:42:20,382
>> I KNOW THE PRESIDENT SAID 

963
06:42:20,382 --> 06:42:23,285
WE'LL KNOW VERY QUICKLY.

964
06:42:23,285 --> 06:42:25,320
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE PORING 

965
06:42:25,320 --> 06:42:26,555
THROUGH THIS LANGUAGE.

966
06:42:26,555 --> 06:42:30,259
WE HEARD FROM KIM JONG UN, THE 

967
06:42:30,259 --> 06:42:36,164
WORLD WILL SIEE MAJOR JACHANGE.

968
06:42:36,164 --> 06:42:37,599
WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS ON 

969
06:42:37,599 --> 06:42:38,767
BOTH SIDES FOR WHAT THOSE WORDS 

970
06:42:38,767 --> 06:42:39,034
MEAN?

971
06:42:39,034 --> 06:42:42,638
>> Reporter: WELL, FOR THE U.S. 

972
06:42:42,638 --> 06:42:48,844
IS COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 

973
06:42:48,844 --> 06:42:49,244
DENUCLEARIZATION.

974
06:42:49,244 --> 06:42:51,447
AND FOR KIM, IT IS SECURITY.

975
06:42:51,447 --> 06:42:53,682
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THE 

976
06:42:53,682 --> 06:42:55,984
UNITED STATES WILL HAVE TO 

977
06:42:55,984 --> 06:42:56,218
VERIFY.

978
06:42:56,218 --> 06:42:57,753
MIKE POMPEO MADE THAT VERY 

979
06:42:57,753 --> 06:42:58,053
CLEAR.

980
06:42:58,053 --> 06:42:59,354
WHATEVER IS THE FINAL AGREEMENT 

981
06:42:59,354 --> 06:43:02,491
HAS TO HAVE THAT COMPLETE 

982
06:43:02,491 --> 06:43:02,891
DENUCLEARIZATION.

983
06:43:02,891 --> 06:43:05,427
KIM JONG UN MAY HAVE A VERY 

984
06:43:05,427 --> 06:43:06,161
DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF WHAT 

985
06:43:06,161 --> 06:43:06,861
THAT MEANS.

986
06:43:06,861 --> 06:43:09,265
HE WANTS TO BE SECURE IF HE DOES

987
06:43:09,265 --> 06:43:10,532
NOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

988
06:43:10,532 --> 06:43:12,601
AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE 

989
06:43:12,601 --> 06:43:14,903
WHO DOUBT THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN,

990
06:43:14,903 --> 06:43:18,007
BUT WE CAN REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.

991
06:43:18,007 --> 06:43:21,042
AND THE U.S., OF COURSE, DOESN'T

992
06:43:21,042 --> 06:43:21,777
TRUST KIM.

993
06:43:21,777 --> 06:43:23,178
THEY WANT TO VERIFY.

994
06:43:23,178 --> 06:43:25,580
BUT THIS IS A START.

995
06:43:25,580 --> 06:43:26,915
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

996
06:43:26,915 --> 06:43:28,049
THIS IS HISTORIC.

997
06:43:28,049 --> 06:43:29,685
I THINK THINGS WILL NOT BE THE 

998
06:43:29,685 --> 06:43:30,552
SAME WITH NORTH KOREA.

999
06:43:30,552 --> 06:43:33,188
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH THE 

1000
06:43:33,188 --> 06:43:34,389
PRESIDENT LEARNED AND HIS STAFF 

1001
06:43:34,389 --> 06:43:40,462
AND HIS AIDES AND SECRETARY 

1002
06:43:40,462 --> 06:43:42,898
POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON WHO ARE 

1003
06:43:42,898 --> 06:43:44,232
IN THERE ABOUT KIM JONG UN.

1004
06:43:44,232 --> 06:43:45,367
NO ONE KNEW.

1005
06:43:45,367 --> 06:43:46,902
WE SAID ALL DAY THE LAST 

1006
06:43:46,902 --> 06:43:49,638
AMERICAN WHO REALLY TALKED TO 

1007
06:43:49,638 --> 06:43:52,107
HIM BEFORE MIKE POMPEO WAS 

1008
06:43:52,107 --> 06:43:53,309
DENNIS RODMAN.

1009
06:43:53,309 --> 06:43:54,776
DENNIS RODMAN KNEW MORE ABOUT 

1010
06:43:54,776 --> 06:43:56,144
KIM JONG UN THAN ANY OTHER 

1011
06:43:56,144 --> 06:43:56,411
AMERICAN.

1012
06:43:56,411 --> 06:43:58,180
AND NOW WE'VE GOT THIS.

1013
06:43:58,180 --> 06:44:00,516
YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW IN THAT 

1014
06:44:00,516 --> 06:44:02,150
ROOM, THOSE AIDES ARE TAKING 

1015
06:44:02,150 --> 06:44:02,451
NOTES.

1016
06:44:02,451 --> 06:44:03,618
THEY'RE WATCHING KIM JONG UN. 

1017
06:44:03,618 --> 06:44:07,656
>> HOW DOES HE NEGOTIATE?

1018
06:44:07,656 --> 06:44:11,927
DO WE THINK HE'S TELLING THE 

1019
06:44:11,927 --> 06:44:12,127
TRUTH?

1020
06:44:12,127 --> 06:44:14,696
MIKE POMPEO IS READING THE BODY 

1021
06:44:14,696 --> 06:44:16,265
LANGUAGE AND WHAT HE SAYS.

1022
06:44:16,265 --> 06:44:17,466
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO, THIS IS

1023
06:44:17,466 --> 06:44:18,901
THE ART OF THE DEAL PRESIDENT.

1024
06:44:18,901 --> 06:44:20,436
HE KNOWS HOW TO WALK IN A ROOM 

1025
06:44:20,436 --> 06:44:21,837
AND GET A DEAL AND KNOWS WHAT TO

1026
06:44:21,837 --> 06:44:23,939
LOOK FOR AND WHAT TO LOOK OUT 

1027
06:44:23,939 --> 06:44:24,106
FOR.

1028
06:44:24,106 --> 06:44:26,040
>> POINTING OUT THAT WE BARELY 

1029
06:44:26,040 --> 06:44:27,209
EVEN HEARD KIM JONG UN'S VOICE 

1030
06:44:27,209 --> 06:44:28,444
PRIOR TO THIS MORNING.

1031
06:44:28,444 --> 06:44:31,079
IT WAS STRIKING TO HEAR IT.

1032
06:44:31,079 --> 06:44:32,814
MARTHA RADDATZ IN SINGAPORE.

1033
06:44:32,814 --> 06:44:34,350
WE APPRECIATE IT, MARTHA.

1034
06:44:34,350 --> 06:44:35,551
>> THANK YOU.

1035
06:44:35,551 --> 06:44:38,220
>>> LET'S TURN NOW TO OUR 

1036
06:44:38,220 --> 06:44:46,128
CONTRIBUTOR, RETIRED COLONEL 

1037
06:44:46,128 --> 06:44:47,095
STEVE GANNYARD.

1038
06:44:47,095 --> 06:44:49,297
>> SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT, 

1039
06:44:49,297 --> 06:44:50,131
PROMISING MAJOR CHANGE.

1040
06:44:50,131 --> 06:44:52,568
CAN A DEAL BE TRUSTED, THOUGH?

1041
06:44:52,568 --> 06:44:54,636
THEY BOTH SEEM INCREDIBLY 

1042
06:44:54,636 --> 06:44:56,071
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT JUST 

1043
06:44:56,071 --> 06:44:57,306
HAPPENED, BUT WHAT DO WE FOCUS 

1044
06:44:57,306 --> 06:44:57,773
ON NOW?

1045
06:44:57,773 --> 06:44:59,408
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT 

1046
06:44:59,408 --> 06:45:01,143
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY NUKES 

1047
06:45:01,143 --> 06:45:01,577
THEY HAVE.

1048
06:45:01,577 --> 06:45:03,345
SO WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER THAT

1049
06:45:03,345 --> 06:45:04,880
WE'RE GOING TO COUNT THEN IT'S 

1050
06:45:04,880 --> 06:45:06,214
HARD TO COUNT THAT NUMBER.

1051
06:45:06,214 --> 06:45:08,283
SO FINDING WAYS TO DO THIS IS 

1052
06:45:08,283 --> 06:45:09,951
GOING TO TAKE QUITE A WHILE.

1053
06:45:09,951 --> 06:45:11,553
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT 

1054
06:45:11,553 --> 06:45:12,287
OF TIME AND NEGOTIATION.

1055
06:45:12,287 --> 06:45:13,688
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL 

1056
06:45:13,688 --> 06:45:15,223
HAPPEN OVER MONTHS IF NOT YEARS 

1057
06:45:15,223 --> 06:45:16,891
TO COME TO THE FINAL DETAILS OF 

1058
06:45:16,891 --> 06:45:17,859
THIS AGREEMENT.

1059
06:45:17,859 --> 06:45:19,494
BUT I'M SITTING HERE WATCHING 

1060
06:45:19,494 --> 06:45:22,597
SOMEBODY WHO SPENT MOST OF MY 

1061
06:45:22,597 --> 06:45:24,032
CAREER THINKING ABOUT THE THREAT

1062
06:45:24,032 --> 06:45:25,100
FROM THE NORTH AND THE HUNDREDS 

1063
06:45:25,100 --> 06:45:26,468
OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO 

1064
06:45:26,468 --> 06:45:28,336
HAVE SERVED IN UNIFORM IN THE 

1065
06:45:28,336 --> 06:45:29,404
PACIFIC WHERE NORTH KOREA WAS 

1066
06:45:29,404 --> 06:45:30,339
THE THREAT.

1067
06:45:30,339 --> 06:45:31,807
AND HERE YOU HAVE THESE TWO MEN 

1068
06:45:31,807 --> 06:45:32,273
SITTING TOGETHER.

1069
06:45:32,273 --> 06:45:34,309
IT IS, WHETHER IT TURNS OUT 

1070
06:45:34,309 --> 06:45:36,645
RIGHT OR WRONG, IT'S STILL AN 

1071
06:45:36,645 --> 06:45:37,345
EXTRAORDINARY SCENE.

1072
06:45:37,345 --> 06:45:39,080
>> NOW STEVE, TWO MONTHS AGO YOU

1073
06:45:39,080 --> 06:45:40,782
SAID THAT YOU WERE SKEPTICAL 

1074
06:45:40,782 --> 06:45:42,617
THAT THEY WOULD BREAK EVERY 

1075
06:45:42,617 --> 06:45:44,686
PROMISE THEY MADE.

1076
06:45:44,686 --> 06:45:46,154
HE SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT 

1077
06:45:46,154 --> 06:45:49,658
JUST TRUST AND VERIFY BUT 

1078
06:45:49,658 --> 06:45:50,092
DISTRUST AND VERIFY.

1079
06:45:50,092 --> 06:45:51,726
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY AFTER 

1080
06:45:51,726 --> 06:45:52,694
SEEING THESE PICTURES?

1081
06:45:52,694 --> 06:45:54,096
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO.

1082
06:45:54,096 --> 06:45:55,463
WE'VE BEEN BURNED IN THE PAST.

1083
06:45:55,463 --> 06:45:57,533
AND UNTIL THEY SHOW SOMETHING 

1084
06:45:57,533 --> 06:45:59,168
DIFFERENT, THEN WE NEED TO, THEN

1085
06:45:59,168 --> 06:46:02,070
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TRUST NO 

1086
06:46:02,070 --> 06:46:03,939
ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN 

1087
06:46:03,939 --> 06:46:05,674
VERIFY EVERYTHING THAT WE AGREE 

1088
06:46:05,674 --> 06:46:05,841
TO.

1089
06:46:05,841 --> 06:46:07,309
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING 

1090
06:46:07,309 --> 06:46:09,278
THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO

1091
06:46:09,278 --> 06:46:10,946
SEE SOME CHANGES, AND I THINK 

1092
06:46:10,946 --> 06:46:12,747
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME TRUE 

1093
06:46:12,747 --> 06:46:14,416
MOVEMENT FORWARD, BUT IT'S ALL 

1094
06:46:14,416 --> 06:46:15,951
GOING TO PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT 

1095
06:46:15,951 --> 06:46:17,886
MONTHS IF NOT YEARS, HOPEFULLY 

1096
06:46:17,886 --> 06:46:19,487
BRINGING PEACE AND REUNIFICATION

1097
06:46:19,487 --> 06:46:20,689
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

1098
06:46:20,689 --> 06:46:22,257
>> ALL RIGHT, SO MANY HOPING FOR

1099
06:46:22,257 --> 06:46:23,892
THAT THIS MORNING.

1100
06:46:23,892 --> 06:46:27,529
STEVE GANYARD FOR US THANK YOU.

1101
06:46:27,529 --> 06:46:28,930
>> OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO 

1102
06:46:28,930 --> 06:46:29,898
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ALL THE 

1103
06:46:29,898 --> 06:46:34,336
DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING IN 

1104
06:46:34,336 --> 06:46:36,538
SINGAPORE, IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

1105
06:46:36,538 --> 06:46:37,906
AS WELL AS WELL AS NORTH KOREA.

1106
06:46:37,906 --> 06:46:39,141
>> THE WORLD IS WATCHING THIS.

1107
06:46:39,141 --> 06:46:40,475
NOT ONLY ARE THE STAKES VERY 

1108
06:46:40,475 --> 06:46:41,643
HIGH FOR THE UNITED STATES, 

1109

AFTER ARRIVING IN ORLANDO 

1234
06:53:36,958 --> 06:53:38,960
BECAUSE AN ALLIGATOR WAS ON THE

1236
06:53:39,227 --> 06:53:42,030
THE FLIGHT WAS ALLOWED TO HEAD

STROLLED INTO THE POND.

1239
06:53:46,534 --> 06:53:50,304

AT FIRST SHE BANGED ON THE DOOR 

1253
06:54:12,894 --> 06:54:14,796
WHEN SHE NOTICED A FIRE AT THE

06:54:14,796 --> 06:54:16,197
NEIGHBOR'S HOME HAD SPREAD TO 

1255

THE WORLD, IT WILL BE 

1291
06:57:12,640 --> 06:57:13,907
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT WILL 

1292
06:57:13,907 --> 06:57:16,744
BE INTERPRETED IN THE SECRETIVE 

1293
06:57:16,744 --> 06:57:17,945
NORTH WHERE INFORMATION IS MORE 

1294
06:57:17,945 --> 06:57:19,280
TIGHTLY CONTROLLED THAN ANYWHERE

1295
06:57:19,280 --> 06:57:20,047
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

1296
06:57:20,047 --> 06:57:21,883
>> MANY NORTH KOREANS IN THE 

1297
06:57:21,883 --> 06:57:24,152
CAPITAL CITY OF PYONGYANG ARE 

1298
06:57:24,152 --> 06:57:25,987
AWAITING WORD FROM STATE MEDIA 

1299
06:57:25,987 --> 06:57:27,822
THERE, WHERE, IN THE SOUTH, THEY

1300
06:57:27,822 --> 06:57:29,757
HELD A VIGIL FOR PEACE THIS PAST

1301
06:57:29,757 --> 06:57:30,825
WEEKEND, AND THERE ARE HOPES 

1302
06:57:30,825 --> 06:57:33,194
THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR STEP 

1303
06:57:33,194 --> 06:57:34,462
TOWARD REUNIFICATION.

1304
06:57:34,462 --> 06:57:36,764
A DREAM FOR MANY KOREANS ON BOTH

1305
06:57:36,764 --> 06:57:38,933
SIDES OF THAT 38th PARALLEL.

1306
06:57:38,933 --> 06:57:42,237
>> LET'S GO TO SOMEONE WHO'S HAD

1307
06:57:42,237 --> 06:57:44,071
INCREDIBLE ACCESS OVER THE 

1308
06:57:44,071 --> 06:57:44,271
YEARS.

1309
06:57:44,271 --> 06:57:47,375
BOB WOODRUFF IS LIVE WITH US.

1310
06:57:47,375 --> 06:57:48,976
WHAT'S THE REACTION SO FAR FROM 

1311
06:57:48,976 --> 06:57:51,379
THE SOUTH KOREANS?

1312
06:57:51,379 --> 06:57:53,114
>> Reporter: WELL, THE SOUTH 

1313
06:57:53,114 --> 06:57:54,481
KOREANS ARE PRETTY HOPEFUL.

1314
06:57:54,481 --> 06:57:56,117
THEY'RE SEEING SOME OF THESE 

1315
06:57:56,117 --> 06:57:56,518
RESULTS.

1316
06:57:56,518 --> 06:57:57,919
I'M RIGHT DOWNTOWN SEOUL RIGHT 

1317
06:57:57,919 --> 06:57:58,319
NOW.

1318
06:57:58,319 --> 06:57:59,754
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S GOING 

1319
06:57:59,754 --> 06:58:01,389
ON IN THIS CAPITAL.

1320
06:58:01,389 --> 06:58:02,723
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO COME OUT 

1321
06:58:02,723 --> 06:58:03,825
OF WORK A LITTLE BIT.

1322
06:58:03,825 --> 06:58:05,193
IT'S BEEN PRETTY DULL MOST OF 

1323
06:58:05,193 --> 06:58:05,827
THE DAY.

1324
06:58:05,827 --> 06:58:07,295
NOW THEY'RE HITTING THE STREETS.

1325
06:58:07,295 --> 06:58:08,863
THIS BACK HERE IS THE BLUE 

1326
06:58:08,863 --> 06:58:10,031
HOUSE, THEIR EQUIVALENT OF THE 

1327
06:58:10,031 --> 06:58:10,598
WHITE HOUSE.

1328
06:58:10,598 --> 06:58:13,134
THIS IS WHERE THE POLITICS 

1329
06:58:13,134 --> 06:58:14,535
HAPPENS, THIS IS WHERE THE BIG 

1330
06:58:14,535 --> 06:58:15,670
MEETINGS ARE HAPPENING.

1331
06:58:15,670 --> 06:58:16,704
BUT THIS IS DOWNTOWN.

1332
06:58:16,704 --> 06:58:18,839
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF 

1333
06:58:18,839 --> 06:58:19,140
THINGS.

1334
06:58:19,140 --> 06:58:20,542
WE'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE U.S.

1335
06:58:20,542 --> 06:58:20,775
EMBASSY.

1336
06:58:20,775 --> 06:58:23,211
YOU CAN SEE THE AMERICAN FLAG 

1337
06:58:23,211 --> 06:58:23,511
RIGHT THERE.

1338
06:58:23,511 --> 06:58:25,412
SO THAT'S GUARDED.

1339
06:58:25,412 --> 06:58:27,415
OUTSIDE BY MULTIPLE GUARDS.

1340
06:58:27,415 --> 06:58:29,217
THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE OUTSIDE.

1341
06:58:29,217 --> 06:58:30,919
AND, IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE, THIS

1342
06:58:30,919 --> 06:58:32,720
IS FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN 

1343
06:58:32,720 --> 06:58:34,154
THIS, SOMEBODY SAYING, AGAINST 

1344
06:58:34,154 --> 06:58:36,557
THE PEACE TALKS WITHOUT NORTH 

1345
06:58:36,557 --> 06:58:37,925
KOREANS, HUMAN RIGHTS.

1346
06:58:37,925 --> 06:58:39,427
PEOPLE WANT THIS TO BE TALKED 

1347
06:58:39,427 --> 06:58:40,161
ABOUT AT THE SUMMIT.

1348
06:58:40,161 --> 06:58:42,663
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY KIM JONG UN 

1349
06:58:42,663 --> 06:58:44,365
IS NOT THIS PEACEFUL MAN.

1350
06:58:44,365 --> 06:58:45,833
THIS IS ONE WHO COMMITTED A LOT 

1351
06:58:45,833 --> 06:58:47,201
OF CRIMES.

1352
06:58:47,201 --> 06:58:49,637
HE'S ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS HALF

1353
06:58:49,637 --> 06:58:52,139
BROTHER AND UNCLE.

1354
06:58:52,139 --> 06:58:53,241
SO THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT 

1355
06:58:53,241 --> 06:58:53,975
TOPIC AS WELL.

1356
06:58:53,975 --> 06:58:55,776
SO EXACTLY WHAT THE REACTION IS 

1357
06:58:55,776 --> 06:58:57,645
TO THE SUMMIT IS PRETTY UNCLEAR.

1358
06:58:57,645 --> 06:58:59,013
BUT PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TALK 

1359
06:58:59,013 --> 06:58:59,881
TO ME.

1360
06:58:59,881 --> 06:59:01,583
AND THEY SAID THEY'RE HAPPY THAT

1361
06:59:01,583 --> 06:59:02,217
SOMETHING POSITIVE COULD COME 

1362
06:59:02,217 --> 06:59:03,951
OUT OF IT, BUT THEY JUST WANT TO

1363
06:59:03,951 --> 06:59:07,021
MAKE SURE THIS IS DONE PROPERLY.

1364
06:59:07,021 --> 06:59:08,656
THEY TRUST GENERALLY, PRESIDENT 

1365
06:59:08,656 --> 06:59:09,923
TRUMP, BUT THEY DON'T REALLY 

1366
06:59:09,923 --> 06:59:10,925
TRUST KIM JONG UN AT ALL.

1367
06:59:10,925 --> 06:59:12,794
PART OF IT'S THAT HISTORY.

1368
06:59:12,794 --> 06:59:14,028
NORTH KOREA, WE DON'T REALLY NOW

1369
06:59:14,028 --> 06:59:15,763
WHAT THE PEOPLE'S REAL THOUGHTS 

1370
06:59:15,763 --> 06:59:15,929
ARE.

1371
06:59:15,929 --> 06:59:18,165
YOU KNOW, INSIDE THEIR SOUL, 

1372
06:59:18,165 --> 06:59:19,167
IT'S HARD TO KNOW.

1373
06:59:19,167 --> 06:59:21,636
EVERY TIME WE VISIT NORTH KOREA,

1374
06:59:21,636 --> 06:59:24,505
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY MINDERS.

1375
06:59:24,505 --> 06:59:28,042
JOURNALISTS CAN'T TALK TO PEOPLE

1376
06:59:28,042 --> 06:59:30,077
WITH REAL FREEDOM.

1377
06:59:30,077 --> 06:59:31,445
SO WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT 

1378
06:59:31,445 --> 06:59:32,847
THEY'RE THINKING, BUT CERTAINLY 

1379
06:59:32,847 --> 06:59:34,315
SHOCKING THAT THEY'VE HEARD ALL 

1380
06:59:34,315 --> 06:59:36,751
THESE DETAILS OF THEIR LEADER, 

1381
06:59:36,751 --> 06:59:41,656
THIS TRIP TO SINGAPORE, TO 

1382
06:59:41,656 --> 06:59:43,258
WATCH, WITH PICTURES OF HIM.

1383
06:59:43,258 --> 06:59:44,692
THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

1384
06:59:44,692 --> 06:59:46,294
WE'LL WAIT AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT 

1385
06:59:46,294 --> 06:59:47,294
HAPPENS HERE IN SEOUL.

1386
06:59:47,294 --> 06:59:48,763
BUT IT'S STARTING TO UNFOLD A 

1387
06:59:48,763 --> 06:59:49,297
LITTLE BIT.

1388
06:59:49,297 --> 06:59:53,700
>> I KNOW IT'S LARHARD TO GET A 

1389
06:59:53,700 --> 06:59:55,569
READ ON THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.

1390
06:59:55,569 --> 06:59:57,405
BUT NORTH KOREA HAS HAD A LOT OF

1391
06:59:57,405 --> 06:59:59,440
DEFECTORS LATELY.

1392
06:59:59,440 --> 07:00:05,079
SPECIFICALLY, ELITES DEFECTING.

1393
07:00:05,079 --> 07:00:08,283
WHAT ARE THEY HOPING FOR?

1394
07:00:08,283 --> 07:00:09,950
>> Reporter: THE NORTH KOREANS, 

1395
07:00:09,950 --> 07:00:12,086
THE FIRST TIME I WENT THERE WAS 

1396
07:00:12,086 --> 07:00:14,088
2005, SO, WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT,

1397
07:00:14,088 --> 07:00:15,322
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE 

1398
07:00:15,322 --> 07:00:16,391
BLUE HOUSE AGAIN.

1399
07:00:16,391 --> 07:00:17,825
THERE'S A BETTER SHOT TO LOOK 

1400
07:00:17,825 --> 07:00:19,493
HERE WHILE WE'RE DOWNTOWN SEOUL.

1401
07:00:19,493 --> 07:00:20,928
BUT THE FIRST TIME I WENT BACK 

1402
07:00:20,928 --> 07:00:22,663
THERE IN 2005 IN NORTH KOREA, 

1403
07:00:22,663 --> 07:00:24,265
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE REALLY KNEW

1404
07:00:24,265 --> 07:00:25,800
NOTHING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

1405
07:00:25,800 --> 07:00:27,735
EVEN A LOT OF THOSE IN 

1406
07:00:27,735 --> 07:00:29,904
PYONGYANG, THE CAPITAL OF NORTH 

1407
07:00:29,904 --> 07:00:30,138
KOREA.

1408
07:00:30,138 --> 07:00:31,205
BUT NOW THERE'S A LOT MORE 

1409
07:00:31,205 --> 07:00:32,573
CONNECTION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

1410
07:00:32,573 --> 07:00:34,642
THEY CAN GET SOME ACCESS TO THE 

1411
07:00:34,642 --> 07:00:35,943
CELL PHONES ALONG THE BORDER 

1412
07:00:35,943 --> 07:00:36,477
WITH CHINA.

1413
07:00:36,477 --> 07:00:41,215
A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM NORTH KOREA

1414
07:00:41,215 --> 07:00:42,850
ARE GOING TO STUDY OVERSEAS.

1415
07:00:42,850 --> 07:00:44,785
A LOT OF DIPLOMATS RETURN AFTER 

1416
07:00:44,785 --> 07:00:46,020
SEEING THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

1417
07:00:46,020 --> 07:00:47,654
SO THE ELITE IN PYONGYANG REALLY

1418
07:00:47,654 --> 07:00:49,090
KNOW WHAT THE WORLD IS.

1419
07:00:49,090 --> 07:00:50,624
IT'S GOT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 

1420
07:00:50,624 --> 07:00:51,992
KIM JONG UN TO DO THINGS 

1421
07:00:51,992 --> 07:00:53,027
DIFFERENT THAN HIS FATHER DID.

1422
07:00:53,027 --> 07:00:54,962
HIS FATHER COULD PROTECT HIS 

1423
07:00:54,962 --> 07:00:56,997
COUNTRY FROM THOSE FROM THE 

1424
07:00:56,997 --> 07:00:57,298
OUTSIDE.

1425
07:00:57,298 --> 07:00:58,833
HE COULD CONVINCE PEOPLE ON THE 

1426
07:00:58,833 --> 07:01:00,868
INSIDE THAT THE LEADERS OF THE 

1427
07:01:00,868 --> 07:01:02,603
REGIME ARE LIKE GODS AND SHOULD 

1428
07:01:02,603 --> 07:01:04,838
NEVER BE DENIED ANYTHING.

1429
07:01:04,838 --> 07:01:06,573
THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 

1430
07:01:06,573 --> 07:01:07,075
DIFFICULT.

1431
07:01:07,075 --> 07:01:08,809
KIM JONG UN HAS SEEN CHINA IS 

1432
07:01:08,809 --> 07:01:10,144
NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH ALL OF 

1433
07:01:10,144 --> 07:01:10,778
THIS ACTIVITY.

1434
07:01:10,778 --> 07:01:12,446
THEY KNOW THEY'RE GETTING 

1435
07:01:12,446 --> 07:01:13,581
PRESSURE FROM THEM AND THE 

1436
07:01:13,581 --> 07:01:14,381
UNITED STATES.

1437
07:01:14,381 --> 07:01:15,649
THERE'S MOTIVATION TO DO 

1438
07:01:15,649 --> 07:01:17,618
SOMETHING THAN WAS DONE BEFORE.

1439
07:01:17,618 --> 07:01:20,221
MAYBE THIS MEANS DENUCLEARIZING,

1440
07:01:20,221 --> 07:01:21,122
OR MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE.

1441
07:01:21,122 --> 07:01:23,224
BUT HE NEEDS MORE MONEY IN THE 

1442
07:01:23,224 --> 07:01:24,424
COUNTRY, SANCTIONS LIFTED.

1443
07:01:24,424 --> 07:01:27,027
AND HE NEEDS, NUMBER ONE, AS A 

1444
07:01:27,027 --> 07:01:27,728
GUARANTEE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

1445
07:01:27,728 --> 07:01:29,731
THAT HE WILL NOT BE ASSASSINATED

1446
07:01:29,731 --> 07:01:32,166
OR HIS REGIME DEFEATED IF HE 

1447
07:01:32,166 --> 07:01:34,301
GETS RID OF HIS NUCLEAR BOMBS, 

1448
07:01:34,301 --> 07:01:35,836
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 

1449
07:01:35,836 --> 07:01:36,270
THAT.

1450
07:01:36,270 --> 07:01:39,874
>> ALL RIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1451
07:01:39,874 --> 07:01:40,541
PROMISING PROTECTION TO KIM JONG

1452
07:01:40,541 --> 07:01:42,109
UN, AND I'M SURE THE PEOPLE IN 

1453
07:01:42,109 --> 07:01:43,811
SOUTH KOREA HOPING THEY'LL BE 

1454
07:01:43,811 --> 07:01:44,845
PROTECTED TOO AND HOPING FOR 

1455
07:01:44,845 --> 07:01:47,014
PEACE TO COME OUT OF THIS DEAL.

1456
07:01:47,014 --> 07:01:48,849
BOB WOODRUFF LIVE IN SEOUL FOR 

1457
07:01:48,849 --> 07:01:49,317
US, THANK YOU.

1458
07:01:49,317 --> 07:01:51,486
>> WHAT A DAY THERE IN SEOUL.

1459
07:01:51,486 --> 07:01:52,887
I'VE BEEN TO SEOUL DURING SOME 

1460
07:01:52,887 --> 07:01:54,622
OF THE WORST TIMES, TENSE 

1461
07:01:54,622 --> 07:01:56,257
MOMENTS, AND THE SOUTH KOREANS 

1462
07:01:56,257 --> 07:01:59,593
ARE JUST LIKE, EH, SO IT'S 

1463
07:01:59,593 --> 07:02:00,528
FASCINATING NOW AT THE GOOD 

1464
07:02:00,528 --> 07:02:01,729
TIMES TO SEE THAT THEY'RE 

1465
07:02:01,729 --> 07:02:02,663
HOPEFUL AND LOOKING FORWARD TO 

1466
07:02:02,663 --> 07:02:02,963
THE FUTURE.

1467
07:02:02,963 --> 07:02:03,364
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1468
07:02:03,697 --> 07:05:09,617
s A and B

MAKIN' LOVE IS THE NUMBER ONE 

1487
07:05:42,349 --> 07:05:44,352

1488
07:05:44,352 --> 07:05:46,720
THE SOUTH KOREAN BOY BAND, BTS 

1489
07:05:46,720 --> 07:05:47,154
OF COURSE.

1490
07:05:47,154 --> 07:05:51,125
AS YOU SAW THE ICONIC MARINA BAY

1491
07:05:51,125 --> 07:05:51,659
SANDS HOTEL.

1492
07:05:51,659 --> 07:05:53,727
>> HAVE YOU STAYED AT THAT 

1493
07:05:53,727 --> 07:05:53,927
HOTEL?

1494
07:05:53,927 --> 07:05:57,564
>> I DON'T MEAN TO NAME DROP, 

1495
07:05:57,564 --> 07:06:00,468
BUT JUST TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS 

1496
07:06:00,468 --> 07:06:02,436
THERE, SUITE 3604.

1497
07:06:02,436 --> 07:06:04,772
>> LOTS OF PEOPLE GO THERE.

1498
07:06:04,772 --> 07:06:06,406
BUT GUESS WHO ELSE WAS THERE?

1499
07:06:06,406 --> 07:06:08,109
KIM JONG UN WAS CHECKING IT OUT,

1500
07:06:08,109 --> 07:06:09,843
PART OF HIS TOUR OF SINGAPORE 

1501
07:06:09,843 --> 07:06:10,844
BEFORE HE MET WITH PRESIDENT 

1502
07:06:10,844 --> 07:06:11,044
TRUMP.

1503
07:06:11,044 --> 07:06:11,845
>> REALLY?

1504
07:06:11,845 --> 07:06:14,415
>> KIND OF AN INTERESTING 

1505
07:06:14,415 --> 07:06:14,648
DYNAMIC.

1506
07:06:14,648 --> 07:06:15,616
BECAUSE SINGAPORE IS KIND OF 

1507
07:06:15,616 --> 07:06:17,317
VIEWED AS THIS EXAMPLE FOR THE 

1508
07:06:17,317 --> 07:06:18,018
DEVELOPED WORLD.

1509
07:06:18,018 --> 07:06:19,687
SO ADVANCED.

1510
07:06:19,687 --> 07:06:21,655
NORTH KOREA IS NOT, SUFFICE IT 

1511
07:06:21,655 --> 07:06:22,123
TO SAY.

1512
07:06:22,123 --> 07:06:24,291
SO I WONDER IF KIM JONG UN, AS 

1513
07:06:24,291 --> 07:06:25,626
HE'S LOOKING AROUND THIS, AT 

1514
07:06:25,626 --> 07:06:28,562
THIS PLACE IS WONDERING, DOES HE

1515
07:06:28,562 --> 07:06:29,830
ASPIRE TO BRING NORTH KOREA TO 

1516
07:06:29,830 --> 07:06:30,497
THAT POINT?

1517
07:06:30,497 --> 07:06:31,298
>> EXACTLY.

1518
07:06:31,298 --> 07:06:33,567
OR SAYING THIS IS EVERYTHING 

1519
07:06:33,567 --> 07:06:35,302
THAT'S WRONG WITH CAPITALISM, 

1520
07:06:35,302 --> 07:06:37,304
ALL THREE TOWERS OF THE MARINA 

1521
07:06:37,304 --> 07:06:38,338
BAY SANDS.

1522
07:06:38,338 --> 07:06:40,741
BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW HE HAS HIS

1523
07:06:40,741 --> 07:06:42,677
BODY GUARDS THERE GIVING THEM A 

1524
07:06:42,677 --> 07:06:44,111
BREAK FROM RUNNING ALONGSIDE 

1525
07:06:44,111 --> 07:06:45,846
THEM AS HE TAKES HIS TOUR.

1526
07:06:45,846 --> 07:06:47,548
BUT FASCINATING SIGHT.

1527
07:06:47,548 --> 07:06:50,517
>> LOTS OF BODYGUARDS, 

1528
07:06:50,517 --> 07:06:51,952
PHOTOGRAPHERS AND VIDEOGRAPHERS 

1529
07:06:51,952 --> 07:06:52,720
AS WELL.

1530
07:06:52,720 --> 07:06:54,221
>> SO WHY SINGAPORE AND WHY 

1531
07:06:54,221 --> 07:06:54,822
RIGHT NOW?

1532
07:06:54,822 --> 07:06:56,457
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING 

1533
07:06:56,457 --> 07:06:56,657
THAT.

1534
07:06:56,657 --> 07:06:59,560
>> LET'S TALK LOCATION.

1535
07:06:59,560 --> 07:07:01,061
SINGAPORE'S IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 

1536
07:07:01,061 --> 07:07:02,463
AND HAS THE INTERESTING 

1537
07:07:02,463 --> 07:07:03,798
DISTINCTION OF BEING A SOVEREIGN

1538
07:07:03,798 --> 07:07:06,700
CITY STATE, KIND OF LIKE MONACO 

1539
07:07:06,700 --> 07:07:09,170
AND VATICAN CITY.

1540
07:07:09,170 --> 07:07:10,537
5.6 MILLION RESIDENTS, THE 

1541
07:07:10,537 --> 07:07:12,173
GLOBAL COMMERCE HUB AS WELL.

1542
07:07:12,173 --> 07:07:13,173
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE 

1543
07:07:13,173 --> 07:07:14,542
HISTORY FOR SINGAPORE, YOU KNOW,

1544
07:07:14,542 --> 07:07:16,409
THE MALAYSIANS ARE LIKE, WE 

1545
07:07:16,409 --> 07:07:18,378
DON'T WANT YOU TO BE A PART OF 

1546
07:07:18,378 --> 07:07:18,646
US.

1547
07:07:18,646 --> 07:07:21,048
AND SO THEY GAVE THAT LAND AND 

1548
07:07:21,048 --> 07:07:22,683
SAID WE'LL SUPPLY YOU WITH 

1549
07:07:22,683 --> 07:07:24,451
WATER, AND YOU CAN JUST DO YOUR 

1550
07:07:24,451 --> 07:07:24,784
OWN THING. 

1551
07:07:24,784 --> 07:07:25,720
>> DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

1552
07:07:25,720 --> 07:07:27,421
>> THE MALAYSIANS WANTED TO BE 

1553
07:07:27,421 --> 07:07:29,156
THEIR OWN MUSLIM COUNTRY, AND 

1554
07:07:29,156 --> 07:07:31,391
NOW SOME 60 YEARS LATER, 

1555
07:07:31,391 --> 07:07:32,960
SINGAPORE IS WAY MORE SUCCESSFUL

1556
07:07:32,960 --> 07:07:35,329
AND SELLING WATER BACK TO THE 

1557
07:07:35,329 --> 07:07:35,629
MALAYSIANS.

1558
07:07:35,629 --> 07:07:37,765
>> SINGAPORE LOOKS TO ME TO BE 

1559
07:07:37,765 --> 07:07:38,566
SIMILAR TO DUBAI.

1560
07:07:38,566 --> 07:07:39,300
IS IT?

1561
07:07:39,300 --> 07:07:40,234
YOU'VE BEEN TO BOTH.

1562
07:07:40,234 --> 07:07:42,069
>> IT IS SIMILAR, AND BOTH SEEM 

1563
07:07:42,069 --> 07:07:44,004
TO BE CITIES OF THE FUTURE.

1564
07:07:44,004 --> 07:07:45,706
DUBAI IS A LOT MORE STRICT.

1565
07:07:45,706 --> 07:07:48,308
BUT SINGAPORE'S STRICT AS WELL.

1566
07:07:48,308 --> 07:07:48,909
THEY'RE BOTH STRICT.

1567
07:07:48,909 --> 07:07:50,344
>> NOT STRICT ENOUGH.

1568
07:07:50,344 --> 07:07:51,545
CLEARLY NOT STRICT ENOUGH, 

1569
07:07:51,545 --> 07:07:52,913
BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED THIS TO 

1570
07:07:52,913 --> 07:07:53,147
HAPPEN.

1571
07:07:53,147 --> 07:07:54,248
>> THEY, YEAH.

1572
07:07:54,248 --> 07:07:56,150
THEY WILL LET ANYBODY IN.

1573
07:07:56,150 --> 07:07:57,651
THEY JUST WON'T LET YOU OUT. 

1574
07:07:57,651 --> 07:07:59,786
>> NICE FLOATIES, BUDDY.

1575
07:07:59,786 --> 07:08:00,921
>> AH, SINGAPORE.

1576
07:08:00,921 --> 07:08:01,388
SORRY, APOLOGIES ALL AROUND.

1577
07:10:09,483 --> 07:10:10,650

MR. TRUMP AND KIM ALL SMILES 

1654
07:12:18,545 --> 07:12:20,781
AHEAD OF THEIR ONE ON ONE 

1655
07:12:20,781 --> 07:12:21,015
MEETING.

1656
07:12:21,015 --> 07:12:23,350
NO AIDES WITH THEM, JUST THEIR 

1657
07:12:23,350 --> 07:12:23,650
TRANSLATORS.

1658
07:12:23,650 --> 07:12:25,152
>> I FEEL REALLY GREAT.

1659
07:12:25,152 --> 07:12:27,154

IT'S MY HONOR, AND WE WILL HAVE

07:12:34,260 --> 07:12:35,462
A TERRIFIC RELATIONSHIP, I HAVE 

1666
07:12:35,462 --> 07:12:36,163
NO DOUBT.

1667
07:12:36,163 --> 07:12:37,697
>> Reporter: LATER U.S. AND 

1668
07:12:37,697 --> 07:12:38,364
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS JOINING 

1669
07:12:38,364 --> 07:12:40,300
FOR A MEETING AND WORKING LUNCH.

1670
07:12:40,300 --> 07:12:42,302
THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT TAKES PLACE

1671
07:12:42,302 --> 07:12:45,439
ON SINGAPORE'S SENTOSA ISLAND.

1672
07:12:45,439 --> 07:12:47,541
THAT MEANS PEACE AND 

1673
07:12:47,541 --> 07:12:48,542
TRANQUILITY, FITTING FOR WHAT 

1674
07:12:48,542 --> 07:12:49,343
THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLING A 

1675
07:12:49,343 --> 07:12:50,377
MISSION OF PEACE.

1676
07:12:50,377 --> 07:12:52,446
THEY HAVE BEEN MEETING HERE IN 

1677
07:12:52,446 --> 07:12:54,748
SINGAPORE, WORKING TOWARD A 

1678
07:12:54,748 --> 07:12:55,749
JOINT STATEMENT THAT PRESIDENT 

1679
07:12:55,749 --> 07:12:56,416
TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN COULD SIGN

1680
07:12:56,416 --> 07:12:58,952
AFTER THEIR MEETINGS.

1681
07:12:58,952 --> 07:13:00,720
MIKE POMPEO SAYS A COMPLETE, 

1682
07:13:00,720 --> 07:13:02,890
VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE 

1683
07:13:02,890 --> 07:13:03,723
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 

1684
07:13:03,723 --> 07:13:05,325
IS THE ONLY OUTCOME THE U.S. 

1685
07:13:05,325 --> 07:13:06,092
WILL ACCEPT.

1686
07:13:06,092 --> 07:13:08,195
>> IN EACH OF THOSE TWO 

1687
07:13:08,195 --> 07:13:09,296
COUNTRIES, THERE ARE ONLY TWO 

1688
07:13:09,296 --> 07:13:10,731
PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS 

1689
07:13:10,731 --> 07:13:12,132
OF THIS MAGNITUDE, AND THOSE TWO

1690
07:13:12,132 --> 07:13:15,034
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SITTING 

1691
07:13:15,034 --> 07:13:15,468
IN A ROOM TOGETHER.

1692
07:13:15,468 --> 07:13:16,102
>> Reporter: BUT THERE ARE KEY 

1693
07:13:16,102 --> 07:13:18,205
DIFFERENCES ON THE ISSUE OF DIE 

1694
07:13:18,205 --> 07:13:18,705
NUCLEARIZATION.

1695
07:13:18,705 --> 07:13:19,606
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

1696
07:13:19,606 --> 07:13:21,408
SIGNALED THEY WANT THE PROCESS 

1697
07:13:21,408 --> 07:13:23,243
TO HAPPEN QUICKLY, PERHAPS ALL 

1698
07:13:23,243 --> 07:13:24,311
AT ONCE.

1699
07:13:24,311 --> 07:13:26,379
NORTH KOREA WANTS A PHASED 

1700
07:13:26,379 --> 07:13:28,415
APPROACH, DISMANTLING IN PHASES 

1701
07:13:28,415 --> 07:13:31,485
AND GETTING SOMETHING IN RETURN.

1702
07:13:31,485 --> 07:13:33,053
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HOLD A 

1703
07:13:33,053 --> 07:13:34,521
PRESS CONFERENCE BEFORE HE MAKES

1704
07:13:34,521 --> 07:13:35,655
THE LONG TRIP BACK TO 

1705
07:13:35,655 --> 07:13:35,955
WASHINGTON.

1706
07:13:35,955 --> 07:13:36,890
HE WAS ASKED IF HE PLANNED TO 

1707
07:13:36,890 --> 07:13:43,697
ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP KIM-- KIM J 

1708
07:13:43,697 --> 07:13:44,464
UN TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND HE 

1709
07:13:44,464 --> 07:13:45,399
SAID HE WILL.

1710
07:13:45,399 --> 07:13:46,867
HE PREDICTED THEY WOULD MEET 

1711
07:13:46,867 --> 07:13:47,734
MANY TIMES.

1712
07:13:47,734 --> 07:13:50,303
>> HOW TO WE GO FORWARD WITH 

1713
07:13:50,303 --> 07:13:52,038
WHATEVER WAS SIGNED IN THIS 

1714
07:13:52,038 --> 07:13:52,272
LETTER.

1715
07:13:52,272 --> 07:13:53,740
CAN THESE TWO MEN TRUST EACH 

1716
07:13:53,740 --> 07:13:54,174
OTHER?

1717
07:13:54,174 --> 07:13:55,308
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT WAS 

1718
07:13:55,308 --> 07:13:56,710
CERTAINLY GUSHING WITH PRAISE 

1719
07:13:56,710 --> 07:13:57,544
FOR KIM JONG UN.

1720
07:13:57,544 --> 07:13:59,312
HE SAID SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS A 

1721
07:13:59,312 --> 07:14:02,983
GREAT HONOR TO MEET HIM.

1722
07:14:02,983 --> 07:14:04,918
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YET WHAT 

1723
07:14:04,918 --> 07:14:07,521
WAS IN THAT JOINT STATEMENT.

1724
07:14:07,521 --> 07:14:09,756
THE PRESIDENT, ALWAYS A TV 

1725
07:14:09,756 --> 07:14:11,225
PRODUCER, GIVING A BIT OF A 

1726
07:14:11,225 --> 07:14:12,359
SUSPENSE THERE, SAYING HE WOULD 

1727
07:14:12,359 --> 07:14:14,094
TALK TO REPORTERS IN A COUPLE OF

1728
07:14:14,094 --> 07:14:15,929
HOURS AND GIVE DETAILS AT THAT 

1729
07:14:15,929 --> 07:14:16,129
POINT.

1730
07:14:16,129 --> 07:14:17,130
BUT THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT 

1731
07:14:17,130 --> 07:14:18,098
OF A CLUE.

1732
07:14:18,098 --> 07:14:18,865
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT 

1733
07:14:18,865 --> 07:14:21,034
THE PROCESS OF DENUCLEARIZATION,

1734
07:14:21,034 --> 07:14:23,003
AND HE SAID HE EXPECTS THAT WILL

1735
07:14:23,003 --> 07:14:24,003
BEGIN PRETTY QUICKLY.

1736
07:14:24,003 --> 07:14:25,805
SO I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THEY 

1737
07:14:25,805 --> 07:14:27,040
GOT FURTHER ALONG THAN MAYBE 

1738
07:14:27,040 --> 07:14:28,575
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN 

1739
07:14:28,575 --> 07:14:29,976
PREDICTING OVER THE LAST FEW 

1740
07:14:29,976 --> 07:14:30,277
DAYS.

1741
07:14:30,277 --> 07:14:31,612
THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS A PROCESS

1742
07:14:31,612 --> 07:14:33,747
NOW THAT THEY HAVE SET OUT FOR 

1743
07:14:33,747 --> 07:14:35,048
NORTH KOREA TO GIVE UP ITS 

1744
07:14:35,048 --> 07:14:36,382
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

1745
07:14:36,382 --> 07:14:38,818
>> ALL RIGHT, OUR KAREN TRAVERS 

1746
07:14:38,818 --> 07:14:40,420
THERE IN SINGAPORE WITH THE VERY

1747
07:14:40,420 --> 07:14:42,222
LATEST ON WHAT HAS BEEN AN 

1748
07:14:42,222 --> 07:14:43,857
AMAZING, INCREDIBLE DAY IN 

1749
07:14:43,857 --> 07:14:44,758
HISTORY, KAREN, THANK YOU.

1750
07:14:44,758 --> 07:14:46,326
>> AND WE ACTUALLY ARE GETTING 

1751
07:14:46,326 --> 07:14:47,694
THAT DOCUMENT RIGHT NOW.

1752
07:14:47,694 --> 07:14:50,063
LET'S GO OVER TO OUR 

1753
07:14:50,063 --> 07:14:53,567
CONTRIBUTOR, STEVE GANYARD FROM 

1754
07:14:53,567 --> 07:14:55,002
WASHINGTON, PICK OUT SOME OF THE

1755
07:14:55,002 --> 07:14:56,336
HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOU'RE SITTING 

1756
07:14:56,336 --> 07:14:56,536
HERE.

1757
07:14:56,536 --> 07:14:58,472
>> I'M SITTING HERE ON MY iPHONE

1758
07:14:58,472 --> 07:15:00,641
TRYING TO EXPAND.

1759
07:15:00,641 --> 07:15:02,408
>> THERE SEEM TO BE ABOUT FOUR 

1760
07:15:02,408 --> 07:15:03,410
DIFFERENT POINTS IN THIS 

1761
07:15:03,410 --> 07:15:04,577
DOCUMENT, AND IT SEEMS AS IF 

1762
07:15:04,577 --> 07:15:05,979
SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY 

1763
07:15:05,979 --> 07:15:06,279
SIGNIFICANT.

1764
07:15:06,279 --> 07:15:08,081
>> YES, THE TWO THAT STUCK OUT 

1765
07:15:08,081 --> 07:15:09,616
WITH ME IS SECURITY GUARANTEES 

1766
07:15:09,616 --> 07:15:11,184
FROM THE U.S.

1767
07:15:11,184 --> 07:15:13,253
SECRETARY POMPEO HINTED AT THIS 

1768
07:15:13,253 --> 07:15:14,454
IN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS.

1769
07:15:14,454 --> 07:15:16,289
THIS IS THE U.S. SAYING, LOOK, 

1770
07:15:16,289 --> 07:15:17,657
WE PROMISE NOTHING WILL HAPPEN 

1771
07:15:17,657 --> 07:15:18,158
TO YOU.

1772
07:15:18,158 --> 07:15:19,893
THAT IS A BIG DEAL.

1773
07:15:19,893 --> 07:15:21,962
WE'RE GOING FROM A STATE OF 

1774
07:15:21,962 --> 07:15:23,663
NEAR-WAR TO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 

1775
07:15:23,663 --> 07:15:24,698
CARE OF YOU.

1776
07:15:24,698 --> 07:15:26,165
THE OTHER PART HERE IS THE 

1777
07:15:26,165 --> 07:15:27,534
COMMITMENT TO DENUCLEARIZATION 

1778
07:15:27,534 --> 07:15:29,803
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

1779
07:15:29,803 --> 07:15:31,104
NOT OF NORTH KOREA.

1780
07:15:31,104 --> 07:15:34,507
THIS IS A BIT OF A CONCESSION AS

1781
07:15:34,507 --> 07:15:34,708
WELL.

1782
07:15:34,708 --> 07:15:36,376
THIS IS WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN 

1783
07:15:36,376 --> 07:15:38,211
STYLE OF NEGOTIATION HAS ALWAYS 

1784
07:15:38,211 --> 07:15:40,514
HELD THAT IT NEEDS TO BE, THE 

1785
07:15:40,514 --> 07:15:42,349
U.S. NEEDS TO GET ITS NUKES OFF 

1786
07:15:42,349 --> 07:15:43,817
OF SOUTH KOREA AS WELL.

1787
07:15:43,817 --> 07:15:45,252
SO THOSE HAVE BEEN GONE FOR 

1788
07:15:45,252 --> 07:15:49,022
QUITE A WHILE, BUT THE FACT IS 

1789
07:15:49,022 --> 07:15:50,323
THAT SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH KOREA

1790
07:15:50,323 --> 07:15:52,559
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE ON NO

1791
07:15:52,559 --> 07:15:53,894
NUKES ON THE PENINSULA.

1792
07:15:53,894 --> 07:15:55,962
AND THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE ANY 

1793
07:15:55,962 --> 07:15:57,097
KIND OF U.S. NUKES THAT MIGHT BE

1794
07:15:57,097 --> 07:15:58,765
IN THE VICINITY AS WELL.

1795
07:15:58,765 --> 07:16:01,001
>> THERE'S SOME TALK ABOUT 

1796
07:16:01,001 --> 07:16:02,669
RECOVERING P.O.W. REMAINS.

1797
07:16:02,669 --> 07:16:03,537
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT?

1798
07:16:03,537 --> 07:16:05,372
>> THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

1799
07:16:05,372 --> 07:16:07,140
THERE ARE, I CAN'T REMEMBER THE 

1800
07:16:07,140 --> 07:16:10,610
EXACT NUMBER, BUT THOUSANDS OF 

1801
07:16:10,610 --> 07:16:14,014
MISSING P.O.W.s AND REMAINS THAT

1802
07:16:14,014 --> 07:16:15,782
HAVE NOT BEEN REPATRIATED.

1803
07:16:15,782 --> 07:16:18,452
YOU REMEMBER THAT WE'VE HAD A 

1804
07:16:18,452 --> 07:16:20,820
LONG HISTORY WITH VIETNAM OF, 

1805
07:16:20,820 --> 07:16:22,322
EVEN WHEN WE WEREN'T GETTING 

1806
07:16:22,322 --> 07:16:24,258
ALONG WITH VIETNAM AFTER THE 

1807
07:16:24,258 --> 07:16:26,226
WAR, OF THEM HELPING US TO 

1808
07:16:26,226 --> 07:16:29,329
REPATRIATE REMAINS OF MIAs AND 

1809
07:16:29,329 --> 07:16:35,502
SO THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

1810
07:16:35,502 --> 07:16:36,136
WE LOST 36,000, 37,000 PEOPLE IN

1811
07:16:36,136 --> 07:16:37,937
THAT WAR, THE U.S. DID ALONE, 

1812
07:16:37,937 --> 07:16:39,539
AND MANY OF THOSE NEVER CAME 

1813
07:16:39,539 --> 07:16:40,507
HOME AND WERE NEVER FOUND.

1814
07:16:40,507 --> 07:16:42,042
SO THIS IS A BIG STEP.

1815
07:16:42,042 --> 07:16:43,410
THE ONE THING YOU'LL NOTICE IS 

1816
07:16:43,410 --> 07:16:44,911
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN PRIME 

1817
07:16:44,911 --> 07:16:47,414
MINISTER ABE MET WITH PRESIDENT 

1818
07:16:47,414 --> 07:16:47,614
TRUMP?

1819
07:16:47,614 --> 07:16:49,583
AND HE SAID PLEASE, SEE WHAT YOU

1820
07:16:49,583 --> 07:16:52,352
CAN DO ABOUT BRINGING HOME THE 

1821
07:16:52,352 --> 07:16:54,154
ABDUCTEES, THE JAPANESE 

1822
07:16:54,154 --> 07:16:54,454
ABDUCTEES.

1823
07:16:54,454 --> 07:16:55,955
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MENTIONED 

1824
07:16:55,955 --> 07:16:56,155
THERE.

1825
07:16:56,155 --> 07:16:57,924
SO THIS LOOKS TO BE PRETTY MUCH,

1826
07:16:57,924 --> 07:16:59,593
THIS IS WHAT THE U.S. WANTS AND 

1827
07:16:59,593 --> 07:17:00,927
LET'S DEAL WITH THE OTHER 

1828
07:17:00,927 --> 07:17:02,095
DETAILS THAT OTHER COUNTRIES 

1829
07:17:02,095 --> 07:17:03,663
WANT LATER.

1830
07:17:03,663 --> 07:17:06,233
>> IT IS THE VERY FIRST DAY.

1831
07:17:06,233 --> 07:17:07,534
AND EVEN THE LETTER ITSELF WAS A

1832
07:17:07,534 --> 07:17:08,902
SURPRISE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

1833
07:17:08,902 --> 07:17:10,203
BE SIGNING ANY KIND OF AN 

1834
07:17:10,203 --> 07:17:10,470
AGREEMENT.

1835
07:17:10,470 --> 07:17:12,638
YOU KNOW THE DYNAMICS OF THAT 

1836
07:17:12,638 --> 07:17:13,473
REGION.

1837
07:17:13,473 --> 07:17:14,608
ANYTHING THAT KIM JONG UN DID 

1838
07:17:14,608 --> 07:17:15,475
TODAY, DID IT HAVE THE 

1839
07:17:15,475 --> 07:17:17,210
PERMISSION AND GUIDANCE OF CHINA

1840
07:17:17,210 --> 07:17:23,417
IN 

1841
07:17:23,417 --> 07:17:23,984
>> ?

1842
07:17:23,984 --> 07:17:25,152
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.

1843
07:17:25,152 --> 07:17:27,454
THEY WERE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AT 

1844
07:17:27,454 --> 07:17:28,855
SENIOR LEVELS WITH THE 

1845
07:17:28,855 --> 07:17:30,857
GOVERNMENT AND SAYING YOU DO 

1846
07:17:30,857 --> 07:17:32,425
THIS, YOU DENUCLEARIZE AND WE 

1847
07:17:32,425 --> 07:17:34,795
WILL GUARANTEE YOUR SURVIVAL.

1848
07:17:34,795 --> 07:17:36,396
NO DOUBT THE CHINESE HAVE DONE 

1849
07:17:36,396 --> 07:17:37,731
SOMETHING SIMILAR.

1850
07:17:37,731 --> 07:17:41,568
REMEMBER THAT KIM HAS MADE TWO 

1851
07:17:41,568 --> 07:17:43,069
SURREPTITIOUS VISITS TO BEIJING 

1852
07:17:43,069 --> 07:17:44,237
IN THE PAST MONTH OR SO.

1853
07:17:44,237 --> 07:17:45,972
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE 

1854
07:17:45,972 --> 07:17:47,641
CHINESE WERE DOING THERE, SAYING

1855
07:17:47,641 --> 07:17:49,008
OKAY, LET'S GET THIS DONE AND 

1856
07:17:49,008 --> 07:17:50,743
PERHAPS WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU 

1857
07:17:50,743 --> 07:17:51,178
AS WELL.

1858
07:17:51,178 --> 07:17:53,246
SO LOTS OF REASSURANCES WENT IN 

1859
07:17:53,246 --> 07:17:54,748
BEHIND THE SCENES TO GET TO 

1860
07:17:54,748 --> 07:17:56,083
WHERE WE WERE TODAY.

1861
07:17:56,083 --> 07:17:57,684
THIS WAS NOT KIM JUST DIVING 

1862
07:17:57,684 --> 07:17:59,285
INTO THE POOL SAYING, OKAY, 

1863
07:17:59,285 --> 07:18:00,220
LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.

1864
07:18:00,220 --> 07:18:02,255
I THINK THAT HE HAD LOTS OF 

1865
07:18:02,255 --> 07:18:03,923
ASSURANCES FROM BOTH THE U.S., 

1866
07:18:03,923 --> 07:18:06,192
SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA.

1867
07:18:06,192 --> 07:18:06,860
>> AND STEVE, REALLY QUICK.

1868
07:18:06,860 --> 07:18:08,695
I KNOW YOU SAID DENUCLEARIZATION

1869
07:18:08,695 --> 07:18:11,531
DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT A PEACE 

1870
07:18:11,531 --> 07:18:11,931
TR

1871
07:18:11,931 --> 07:18:16,169
TREATY AS WELL WITH SOUTH CRAY.

1872
07:18:16,169 --> 07:18:16,702
HOW

1873
07:18:16,702 --> 07:18:17,838
 -- KOREA, HOW MUCH OF A GAME 

1874
07:18:17,838 --> 07:18:19,673
CHANGER IS THIS?

1875
07:18:19,673 --> 07:18:20,774
>> PRESIDENT MOON HAS BEEN A 

1876
07:18:20,774 --> 07:18:22,442
DRIVING FORCE IN THIS.

1877
07:18:22,442 --> 07:18:23,810
HE HAS HIS OWN INTEREST.

1878
07:18:23,810 --> 07:18:25,578
HE HAS BEEN RUNNING ON A 

1879
07:18:25,578 --> 07:18:27,547
PLATFORM THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO OR

1880
07:18:27,547 --> 07:18:29,616
HE WAS PUSHING FOR 

1881
07:18:29,616 --> 07:18:30,817
REUNIFICATION.

1882
07:18:30,817 --> 07:18:32,219
REMEMBER THAT KIM JONG UN'S 

1883
07:18:32,219 --> 07:18:34,254
GRANDFATHER, WHEN THEY STARTED 

1884
07:18:34,254 --> 07:18:36,256
THE WHOLE IDEOLOGY OF NORTH 

1885
07:18:36,256 --> 07:18:38,291
KOREA, THAT WAS BASED ON 

1886
07:18:38,291 --> 07:18:39,726
REUNIFICATION OF THE PENINSULA.

1887
07:18:39,726 --> 07:18:42,662
SO BOTH SOUTH KOREA AND JUJU 

1888
07:18:42,662 --> 07:18:47,768
TALKS ABOUT THEIR.

1889
07:18:47,768 --> 07:18:48,101
B

1890
07:18:48,101 --> 07:18:49,202
-- THIS, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH 

1891
07:18:49,202 --> 07:18:51,104
KOREA WANT TO REUNIFY FOR 

1892
07:18:51,104 --> 07:18:51,671
DIFFERENT REASONS.

1893
07:18:51,671 --> 07:18:52,972
THIS WILL ALLOW PRESIDENT MOON 

1894
07:18:52,972 --> 07:18:54,574
TO WORK ON THAT PEACE TREATY.

1895
07:18:54,574 --> 07:18:56,309
IT'S GOT TO BE A PEACE TREATY 

1896
07:18:56,309 --> 07:18:57,744
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH 

1897
07:18:57,744 --> 07:18:57,944
KOREA.

1898
07:18:57,944 --> 07:19:00,013
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY BACK IN 1950

1899
07:19:00,013 --> 07:19:00,914
A CIVIL WAR.

1900
07:19:00,914 --> 07:19:06,653
AND THAT CIVIL WAR HAS TO BE 

1901
07:19:06,653 --> 07:19:08,288
ENDED BY THE COMBATANTS.

1902
07:19:08,288 --> 07:19:09,856
NOT THE U.S.

1903
07:19:09,856 --> 07:19:10,757
>> THANK YOU.

1904
07:19:10,757 --> 07:19:12,859
AND THE START OF THAT HISTORIC 

1905
07:19:12,859 --> 07:19:14,227
SUMMIT HAS BEEN AN EMOTIONAL 

1906
07:19:14,227 --> 07:19:15,528
EVENT FOR ANOTHER MAN, ONE 

1907
07:19:15,528 --> 07:19:17,764
CONSIDERED A FRIEND BY BOTH 

1908
07:19:17,764 --> 07:19:18,431
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN.

1909
07:19:18,431 --> 07:19:20,433
>> BUT REALLY, HE WAS THE 

1910
07:19:20,433 --> 07:19:22,168
AMBASSADOR WHO BROKERED THIS, 

1911
07:19:22,168 --> 07:19:23,202

DENNIS RODMAN.

1914

THE IMAGES FROM SINGAPORE 

1915
07:19:27,307 --> 07:19:30,243
BROUGHT THE FORMER DETROIT 

1916
07:19:30,243 --> 07:19:31,511
PISTONS BAD BOY TO TEARS.

1917
07:19:31,511 --> 07:19:32,779

2012
07:25:09,149 --> 07:25:10,183
THE CAUSE IS UNDER 

2013
07:25:10,183 --> 07:25:10,517
INVESTIGATION.

2014
07:25:10,517 --> 07:25:12,652
BUT OFFICIALS SAY THEY DO NOT

2091
07:29:28,707 --> 07:29:30,543
HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING 

2092
07:29:30,543 --> 07:29:31,277
LIKE THIS.

2093
07:29:31,277 --> 07:29:33,779
BEING HERE IN SINGAPORE, 

2094
07:29:33,779 --> 07:29:35,415
WITNESSING A NORTH KOREAN 

2095
07:29:35,415 --> 07:29:37,116
DICTATOR, THE DICTATOR OF 

2096
07:29:37,116 --> 07:29:39,051
POSSIBLY THE MOST BRUTAL 

2097
07:29:39,051 --> 07:29:41,454
DICTATORSHIP ON EARTH, WANDER 

2098
07:29:41,454 --> 07:29:43,222
AROUND THERE, DOWNTOWN SINGAPORE

2099
07:29:43,222 --> 07:29:44,490
LAST NIGHT WAS VERY, VERY 

2100
07:29:44,490 --> 07:29:44,724
STRANGE.

2101
07:29:44,724 --> 07:29:45,425
IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.

2102
07:29:45,425 --> 07:29:47,560
WE WERE IN OUR HOTEL HERE IN 

2103
07:29:47,560 --> 07:29:48,994
CENTRAL SINGAPORE, AND WE 

2104
07:29:48,994 --> 07:29:50,563
SUDDENLY GOT WORD THAT HIS 

2105
07:29:50,563 --> 07:29:52,298
MOTORCADE HAD LEFT HIS HOTEL.

2106
07:29:52,298 --> 07:29:53,599
WE THOUGHT WAIT A MINUTE, THAT 

2107
07:29:53,599 --> 07:29:54,600
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

2108
07:29:54,600 --> 07:29:55,835
THAT WASN'T SCRIPTED.

2109
07:29:55,835 --> 07:29:57,937
SO WE RUSHED TO OUR TVS TO WATCH

2110
07:29:57,937 --> 07:29:59,272
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

2111
07:29:59,272 --> 07:30:01,874
AND SURE ENOUGH, HIS BULLETPROOF

2112
07:30:01,874 --> 07:30:03,309
MERCEDES HAD PULLED UP IN 

2113
07:30:03,309 --> 07:30:04,143
DOWNTOWN SING IMPORTANT.

2114
07:30:04,143 --> 07:30:09,582
OUT HE G-- SINGAPORE, OUT HE GO,

2115
07:30:09,582 --> 07:30:11,250
FOLLOWED BY THE GUYS THAT JOG 

2116
07:30:11,250 --> 07:30:13,586
ALONG HIS MOTORCADE, THEY WERE 

2117
07:30:13,586 --> 07:30:14,420
THERE TOO.

2118
07:30:14,420 --> 07:30:16,255
THEN HE STARTS CROSSING OVER 

2119
07:30:16,255 --> 07:30:18,124
THIS BRIDGE, WAVING AT PEOPLE, 

2120
07:30:18,124 --> 07:30:19,057
TAKING SELFIES.

2121
07:30:19,057 --> 07:30:20,893
THIS MAN HAS BEEN, PEOPLE ALLEGE

2122
07:30:20,893 --> 07:30:23,696
THAT HE HAS KILLED THOUSANDS OF 

2123
07:30:23,696 --> 07:30:25,331
PEOPLE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, 

2124
07:30:25,331 --> 07:30:27,366
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FAMILY TO 

2125
07:30:27,366 --> 07:30:28,401
CONSOLIDATE POWER IN NORTH 

2126
07:30:28,401 --> 07:30:30,036
KOREA, AND HERE HE IS IN 

2127
07:30:30,036 --> 07:30:31,604
SINGAPORE, WHAT IS THE ENVY OF 

2128
07:30:31,604 --> 07:30:33,305
ASIA IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC 

2129
07:30:33,305 --> 07:30:34,807
DEVELOPMENT, WANDERING AROUND, 

2130
07:30:34,807 --> 07:30:35,775
SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE.

2131
07:30:35,775 --> 07:30:37,276
AT ONE POINT HE TOOK A SELFIE 

2132
07:30:37,276 --> 07:30:39,712
WITH A MEMBER OF THE SINGAPOREAN

2133
07:30:39,712 --> 07:30:40,446
GOVERNMENT.

2134
07:30:40,446 --> 07:30:41,814
IT WAS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.

2135
07:30:41,814 --> 07:30:43,015
THEN HE TOOK A TOUR OF THAT 

2136
07:30:43,015 --> 07:30:44,917
BUILDING THERE, THE MARINA BAY 

2137
07:30:44,917 --> 07:30:48,354
SANDS HOTEL.

2138
07:30:48,354 --> 07:30:50,422
THERE'S A COASINO IN THERE.

2139
07:30:50,422 --> 07:30:52,625
THE IDEA THAT A DICTATOR OF A 

2140
07:30:52,625 --> 07:30:53,826
COMMUNIST REGIME WOULD TAKE A 

2141
07:30:53,826 --> 07:30:55,895
TOUR OF A CASINO IS REALLY QUITE

2142
07:30:55,895 --> 07:30:56,295
SOMETHING.

2143
07:30:56,295 --> 07:30:57,963
BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE SHOWMAN.

2144
07:30:57,963 --> 07:30:59,331
THAT'S THE SHOWMAN IN KIM JONG 

2145
07:30:59,331 --> 07:30:59,531
UN.

2146
07:30:59,531 --> 07:31:01,099
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT BETTER 

2147
07:31:01,099 --> 07:31:02,735
SHOWMAN FOR HIM TO MEET THAN 

2148
07:31:02,735 --> 07:31:03,202
DONALD TRUMP.

2149
07:31:03,202 --> 07:31:05,304
BOTH OF THEM CERTAINLY LIKE A 

2150
07:31:05,304 --> 07:31:05,538
GAMBLE.

2151
07:31:05,538 --> 07:31:07,139
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE 

2152
07:31:07,139 --> 07:31:10,443
SEEN.

2153
07:31:10,443 --> 07:31:12,511
I THINK FOR ME, WATCHING ALL 

2154
07:31:12,511 --> 07:31:14,247
THIS HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY BUT 

2155
07:31:14,247 --> 07:31:15,314
ALSO SEEING WHAT KIM JONG UN IS 

2156
07:31:15,314 --> 07:31:16,815
FACED WITH WHEN HE STEPS OUT OF 

2157
07:31:16,815 --> 07:31:17,383
HIS BUBBLE.

2158
07:31:17,383 --> 07:31:19,117
WE SAW IT A FEW MOMENTS AGO, HE 

2159
07:31:19,117 --> 07:31:20,819
WAS OUT IN THE GARDENS OUTSIDE 

2160
07:31:20,819 --> 07:31:21,521
THE RESORT.

2161
07:31:21,521 --> 07:31:23,155
AND I WAS BEING SHOUTED 

2162
07:31:23,155 --> 07:31:24,523
QUESTIONS OUT BY REPORTERS.

2163
07:31:24,523 --> 07:31:25,691
THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.

2164
07:31:25,691 --> 07:31:26,892
>> ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 

2165
07:31:26,892 --> 07:31:28,193
INDEED, CONSIDERING WE HAVEN'T 

2166
07:31:28,193 --> 07:31:30,229
HEARD MUCH FROM THIS MAN FOR 

2167
07:31:30,229 --> 07:31:31,196
DECADES OR FOR YEARS.

2168
07:31:31,196 --> 07:31:33,098
JAMES, REALLY, REALLY QUICKLY.

2169
07:31:33,098 --> 07:31:34,433
WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS 

2170
07:31:34,433 --> 07:31:36,068
SUMMIT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO.

2171
07:31:36,068 --> 07:31:40,739
IT HAS TAKEN A HERCULESEN EFFORT

2172
07:31:40,739 --> 07:31:42,942
TO GET YOU GUYS THERE.

2173
07:31:42,942 --> 07:31:46,512
TELL US ABOUT THE MEDIA FRENZY 

2174
07:31:46,512 --> 07:31:46,712
THERE.

2175
07:31:46,712 --> 07:31:48,380
>> Reporter: I MEAN, EVERY 

2176
07:31:48,380 --> 07:31:51,050
SINGLE MEDIA ORGANIZATION IS IN 

2177
07:31:51,050 --> 07:31:51,317
SINGAPORE.

2178
07:31:51,317 --> 07:31:54,086
THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER ENORMOUS 

2179
07:31:54,086 --> 07:31:56,355
HOTELS AT GREAT EXPENSE.

2180
07:31:56,355 --> 07:31:58,591
THE SINGAPOREN GOVERNMENT HAS 

2181
07:31:58,591 --> 07:32:00,326
SPENT SOMETHING LIKE $15 MILLION

2182
07:32:00,326 --> 07:32:01,927
FOR THIS EVENT, BUT I THINK 

2183
07:32:01,927 --> 07:32:03,062
THEY'RE GOING TO REAP THAT BACK 

2184
07:32:03,062 --> 07:35:10,683
BY ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COM

2185
07:35:10,683 --> 07:35:14,353

2186
07:35:14,353 --> 07:35:14,720
MODELING CAREER.

2187
07:35:14,720 --> 07:35:17,556
WHAT'S THE LOOK THAT I'M GETTING

2188
07:35:17,556 --> 07:35:18,724
RIGHT NOW?

2189
07:35:18,724 --> 07:35:23,529
WHAT'S THAT ONE CALLED?

2190
07:35:23,529 --> 07:35:24,330
IT'S LIKE THE PENSIVE LOOK?

07:43:04,923 --> 07:43:06,358
HOUSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

2374
07:43:06,358 --> 07:43:09,228
AND WE'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 

2375
07:43:09,228 --> 07:43:09,995
TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE WEEKS 

2376
07:43:09,995 --> 07:43:11,496
LEADING UP TO THIS SUMMIT.

2377
07:43:11,496 --> 07:43:12,764
HE HAS SAID THAT KIM JONG UN 

2378
07:43:12,764 --> 07:43:13,965
WILL HAVE PROTECTIONS AND 

2379
07:43:13,965 --> 07:43:15,533
SECURITIES AND ALSO A PROMISE 

2380
07:43:15,533 --> 07:43:16,735
THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT 

2381
07:43:16,735 --> 07:43:18,937
PURSUE A POLICY OF REGIME 

2382
07:43:18,937 --> 07:43:19,171
CHANGE.

2383
07:43:19,171 --> 07:43:20,639
THAT'S OF COURSE A VERY BIG DEAL

2384
07:43:20,639 --> 07:43:21,740
FOR KIM JONG UN.

2385
07:43:21,740 --> 07:43:23,175
BECAUSE HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS WERE

2386
07:43:23,175 --> 07:43:24,843
HIS LEVERAGE ON THE GLOBAL 

2387
07:43:24,843 --> 07:43:25,043
STAGE.

2388
07:43:25,043 --> 07:43:27,612
IF HE GIVES THEM UP, EVEN IN A 

2389
07:43:27,612 --> 07:43:30,015
SLOWER PROCESS, HE LOSES THAT 

2390
07:43:30,015 --> 07:43:30,282
LEVERAGE.

2391
07:43:30,282 --> 07:43:32,083
SO THE PRESIDENT'S SAYING A 

2392
07:43:32,083 --> 07:43:33,718
COUPLE WEEKS AGO, KIM JONG UN 

2393
07:43:33,718 --> 07:43:35,453
WILL KEEP HIS JOB AND HIS 

2394
07:43:35,453 --> 07:43:36,354
ADMINISTRATION WILL HELP 

2395
07:43:36,354 --> 07:43:37,055
GUARANTEE THAT.

2396
07:43:37,055 --> 07:43:38,924
>> WHAT'S THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE 

2397
07:43:38,924 --> 07:43:40,625
THERE IN SINGAPORE, BESIDES 

2398
07:43:40,625 --> 07:43:42,261
BEING HOT AND HUMID.

2399
07:43:42,261 --> 07:43:43,729
WHAT'S THE GENERAL FEEL THERE AS

2400
07:43:43,729 --> 07:43:46,164
YOU GO ABOUT THAT THIS IS, 

2401
07:43:46,164 --> 07:43:50,102
YOU'RE EYEWITNESS TO AN AMAZING,

2402
07:43:50,102 --> 07:43:51,136
HISTORICAL MOMENT THERE.

2403
07:43:51,136 --> 07:43:52,470
>> Reporter: THAT WAS AN 

2404
07:43:52,470 --> 07:43:53,672
INCREDIBLE FIRST MEETING, WHEN 

2405
07:43:53,672 --> 07:43:56,107
THINK WALKED OUT TOGETHER, THEY 

2406
07:43:56,107 --> 07:43:57,175
SHOOK HANDS.

2407
07:43:57,175 --> 07:43:59,177
THEY WERE VERY SERIOUS, THEIR 

2408
07:43:59,177 --> 07:44:00,412
EXPRESSIONS, BUT AS THEY WALKED 

2409
07:44:00,412 --> 07:44:02,747
AWAY FROM THE CAMERAS, KENDIS, 

2410
07:44:02,747 --> 07:44:03,681
THEY WERE ALL SMILES.

2411
07:44:03,681 --> 07:44:05,550
THERE WAS A LOT OF PHYSICAL 

2412
07:44:05,550 --> 07:44:06,250
CONTACT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2413
07:44:06,250 --> 07:44:06,919
AND KIM JONG UN.

2414
07:44:06,919 --> 07:44:09,554
BOTH TRYING TO EXERT A LITTLE 

2415
07:44:09,554 --> 07:44:10,555
ALPHA DOG STATUS.

2416
07:44:10,555 --> 07:44:16,128
THIS WAS A NEUTRAL SITE.

2417
07:44:16,128 --> 07:44:16,728
NOBODY WAS HOSTING THE OTHER 

2418
07:44:16,728 --> 07:44:16,962
LEADER.

2419
07:44:16,962 --> 07:44:17,596
YOU GOT THE SENSE THAT PRESIDENT

2420
07:44:17,596 --> 07:44:18,330
TRUMP WANTED TO SHOW HE WAS IN 

2421
07:44:18,330 --> 07:44:19,031
COMMAND OF THIS MEETING.

2422
07:44:19,031 --> 07:44:21,366
AT THE END OF THIS HE WAS ASKED 

2423
07:44:21,366 --> 07:44:22,634
IF HE WOULD INVITE KIM JONG UN 

2424
07:44:22,634 --> 07:44:23,201
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

2425
07:44:23,201 --> 07:44:24,903
HE SAID ABSOLUTELY HE WILL.

2426
07:44:24,903 --> 07:44:26,304
HE ALSO PREDICTED THEY WOULD 

2427
07:44:26,304 --> 07:44:27,906
HAVE MANY MEETINGS.

2428
07:44:27,906 --> 07:44:29,607
AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO SAY, 

2429
07:44:29,607 --> 07:44:31,843
STAY TUNED, WE'LL SEE.

2430
07:44:31,843 --> 07:44:33,744
AND WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S DETAILS

2431
07:44:33,744 --> 07:44:35,613
ABOUT ANOTHER SIT-DOWN MAYBE 

2432
07:44:35,613 --> 07:44:38,617
SOMEWHERE IN ASIA.

2433
07:44:38,617 --> 07:44:38,884
WE'LL SEE.

2434
07:44:38,884 --> 07:44:40,418
>> HE SAID THAT THEY'RE TAKING 

2435
07:44:40,418 --> 07:44:41,653
CARE OF A DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR 

2436
07:44:41,653 --> 07:44:42,754
THE WORLD.

2437
07:44:42,754 --> 07:44:44,622
PRESUMABLY REFERRING TO NUCLEAR 

2438
07:44:44,622 --> 07:44:45,256
WEAPONS THERE.

2439
07:44:45,256 --> 07:44:46,791
BUT THE STAKES ARE HIGH FOR THE 

2440
07:44:46,791 --> 07:44:48,226
WORLD, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR 

2441
07:44:48,226 --> 07:44:50,128
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA.

2442
07:44:50,128 --> 07:44:53,364
WHAT ARE THE PERCEPTIONS THERE?

2443
07:44:53,364 --> 07:44:54,699
>> Reporter: WELL, THEY EACH 

2444
07:44:54,699 --> 07:44:56,368
HAVE THEIR OWN SECURITY 

2445
07:44:56,368 --> 07:44:56,802
INTERESTS.

2446
07:44:56,802 --> 07:44:58,537
YOU HAVE SOUTH KOREA, OF COURSE,

2447
07:44:58,537 --> 07:45:01,206
SHARING THE PENINSULA WITH NORTH

2448
07:45:01,206 --> 07:45:01,473
KOREA.

2449
07:45:01,473 --> 07:45:02,640
AND PRESIDENT MOON, THE 

2450
07:45:02,640 --> 07:45:03,875
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA HAS 

2451
07:45:03,875 --> 07:45:05,910
REALLY PLAYED A LEAD ROLE IN 

2452
07:45:05,910 --> 07:45:06,912
GETTING THIS MEETING TO EVEN 

2453
07:45:06,912 --> 07:45:07,179
HAPPEN.

2454
07:45:07,179 --> 07:45:09,881
HE WAS THE ONE THAT PRESENTED 

2455
07:45:09,881 --> 07:45:10,481
THE INVITATION TO PRESIDENT 

2456
07:45:10,481 --> 07:45:11,983
TRUMP BACK IN MARCH FROM KIM 

2457
07:45:11,983 --> 07:45:13,284
JONG UN, THE ONE THAT HE 

2458
07:45:13,284 --> 07:45:14,486
ACCEPTED VERY QUICKLY.

2459
07:45:14,486 --> 07:45:15,554
AND REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT 

2460
07:45:15,554 --> 07:45:16,788
TRUMP CANCELED THIS MEETING A 

2461
07:45:16,788 --> 07:45:18,122
COUPLE WEEKS AGO IN THAT LETTER 

2462
07:45:18,122 --> 07:45:21,292
TO KIM JONG UN, IT WAS PRESIDENT

2463
07:45:21,292 --> 07:45:22,093
MOON WHO THEN VERY QUICKLY SET 

2464
07:45:22,093 --> 07:45:23,995
UP A MEETING WITH KIM TO TRY TO 

2465
07:45:23,995 --> 07:45:26,131
GET THINGS BACK ON TRACK.

2466
07:45:26,131 --> 07:45:27,365
JAPAN HAS BEEN MORE ON THE 

2467
07:45:27,365 --> 07:45:29,367
SIDELINES OF ALL OF THIS, PRIME 

2468
07:45:29,367 --> 07:45:30,701
MINISTER ABE HAS NOT MET WITH 

2469
07:45:30,701 --> 07:45:31,002
KIM JONG UN.

2470
07:45:31,002 --> 07:45:32,437
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SECURITY 

2471
07:45:32,437 --> 07:45:32,737
INTERESTS.

2472
07:45:32,737 --> 07:45:34,172
AND THEY WERE REALLY HOPING THAT

2473
07:45:34,172 --> 07:45:35,240
THE UNITED STATES WOULD ADD THAT

2474
07:45:35,240 --> 07:45:39,377
TO THEIR AGENDA, SHORT AND 

2475
07:45:39,377 --> 07:45:39,844
MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILES.

2476
07:45:39,844 --> 07:45:41,346
NOT JUST THE ONES THAT CAN HIT 

2477
07:45:41,346 --> 07:45:43,181
THE U.S. MAINLAND, BUT THE ONES 

2478
07:45:43,181 --> 07:45:44,182
THAT CAN HIT JAPAN.

2479
07:45:44,182 --> 07:45:45,683
THEY'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE NORTH 

2480
07:45:45,683 --> 07:45:47,052
KOREA AND THE UNITED STATES 

2481
07:45:47,052 --> 07:45:49,221
ADDRESS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.

2482
07:45:49,221 --> 07:45:50,221
THERE'S NO SUGGESTION OR 

2483
07:45:50,221 --> 07:45:51,523
INDICATION THAT THAT WAS PART OF

2484
07:45:51,523 --> 07:45:52,724
THESE DISCUSSIONS.

2485
07:45:52,724 --> 07:45:54,225
>> THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 

2486
07:45:54,225 --> 07:45:56,127
POMPEO JUST MOMENTS AGO TWEETING

2487
07:45:56,127 --> 07:45:58,596
A PHOTO OF PHONE CALLS HE HAD 

2488
07:45:58,596 --> 07:46:00,932
WITH THE LEADERS OF JAPAN AS 

2489
07:46:00,932 --> 07:46:02,467
WELL AS WITH SOUTH KOREA.

2490
07:46:02,467 --> 07:46:03,902
I'M ASSUMING HE GOT SOME 

2491
07:46:03,902 --> 07:46:05,503
ASSURANCES OVER TO THEM MOMENTS 

2492
07:46:05,503 --> 07:46:05,971
AGO.

2493
07:46:05,971 --> 07:46:08,173
WE'LL SEE.

2494
07:46:08,173 --> 07:46:10,776
KAREN TRAVERS THERE IN COOL 

2495
07:46:10,776 --> 07:46:12,410
SINGAPORE THERE ON THE EQUATOR, 

2496
07:46:12,410 --> 07:46:15,180
WITH A WIND CHILL OF 20, OH, 

2497
07:46:15,180 --> 07:46:16,915
WAIT, THAT'S IN CELSIUS.

2498
07:46:16,915 --> 07:46:18,083
IT'S HOT.

2499
07:46:18,083 --> 07:46:18,283
SORRY.

2500
07:46:18,283 --> 07:46:20,919
>> ENJOY THE HEAT, KAREN, THANK 

2501
07:46:20,919 --> 07:46:21,119
YOU.

2502
07:46:21,119 --> 07:46:22,854
>>> NOW LET'S GET A BREAK DOWN 

2503
07:46:22,854 --> 07:46:26,891
OF THIS WHOLE DAY AND WHAT THIS 

2504
07:46:26,891 --> 07:46:28,093
ALL MINES.

2505
07:46:28,160 --> 07:46:28,426
 -- MEANS.

2506
07:46:28,426 --> 07:46:32,997
>> FOR MORE INSIGHT, WE TURN TO 

2507
07:46:32,997 --> 07:46:35,600
TOM BOSSERT.

2508
07:46:35,600 --> 07:46:36,734
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ALL OF 

2509
07:46:36,734 --> 07:46:39,938
THESE DEVELOPMENTS, AND IT LOOKS

2510
07:46:39,938 --> 07:46:41,706
REALLY NICE AS FAR AS A PHOTO 

2511
07:46:41,706 --> 07:46:44,976
OP, BUT THE REALITY IS WHAT?

2512
07:46:44,976 --> 07:46:45,777
>> GOOD MORNING.

2513
07:46:45,777 --> 07:46:47,178
IT'S HARD TO TRACK THE TIME 

2514
07:46:47,178 --> 07:46:47,479
HERE.

2515
07:46:47,479 --> 07:46:49,013
I AM LOOKING THROUGH THIS 

2516
07:46:49,013 --> 07:46:50,182
DOCUMENT THAT THEY SIGNED AND 

2517
07:46:50,182 --> 07:46:52,417
THE REALITY, KNOWING WHAT I KNOW

2518
07:46:52,417 --> 07:46:53,618
ABOUT WHAT WENT INTO THESE TALKS

2519
07:46:53,618 --> 07:46:55,987
TODAY IS THAT THE WORDS IN THIS 

2520
07:46:55,987 --> 07:46:57,255
DOCUMENT ARE TRULY HISTORIC.

2521
07:46:57,255 --> 07:46:58,923
IF THEY CAN MAKE GOOD ON THE 

2522
07:46:58,923 --> 07:47:00,625
WORDS IN THIS DOCUMENT, THIS IS 

2523
07:47:00,625 --> 07:47:02,760
A BLUEPRINT FOR PEACE AND A 

2524
07:47:02,760 --> 07:47:03,060
REVELATION.

2525
07:47:03,060 --> 07:47:05,530
>> AND TOM, I KNOW ONE OF THE 

2526
07:47:05,530 --> 07:47:07,532
BIG THINGS EVERYONE WAS LOOKING 

2527
07:47:07,532 --> 07:47:08,833
FOR, NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.

2528
07:47:08,833 --> 07:47:11,136
IT SEEMS THAT APPEARS IN THIS 

2529
07:47:11,136 --> 07:47:13,138
DOCUMENT, APPLYING TO THE KOREAN

2530
07:47:13,138 --> 07:47:13,405
PENINSULA.

2531
07:47:13,405 --> 07:47:15,473
THAT'S A BIT OF A CONCESSION ON 

2532
07:47:15,473 --> 07:47:20,044
THE PART OF THE U.S., AND IN 

2533
07:47:20,044 --> 07:47:22,780
EXCHANGE, THE OUSU.S. IS PROMIS 

2534
07:47:22,780 --> 07:47:23,047
SECURITY.

2535
07:47:23,047 --> 07:47:25,383
WHAT DETERMINES IF THEY WALK 

2536
07:47:25,383 --> 07:47:27,819
AWAY CONSIDERING THEMSELVES 

2537
07:47:27,819 --> 07:47:28,053
WINNERS?

2538
07:47:28,053 --> 07:47:30,021
>> WELL, I THINK THAT BOTH OF 

2539
07:47:30,021 --> 07:47:31,523
THESE MEN SHOULD WALK AWAY 

2540
07:47:31,523 --> 07:47:33,491
CONSIDERING THEMSELVES WINNERS 

2541
07:47:33,491 --> 07:47:34,626
IF THEY TRULY MEAN WHAT THEY 

2542
07:47:34,626 --> 07:47:37,362
SAID IN THIS DOCUMENT.

2543
07:47:37,362 --> 07:47:39,697
I THINK YOU MADE A VERY GOOD 

2544
07:47:39,697 --> 07:47:40,232
POINT.

2545
07:47:40,232 --> 07:47:41,533
THEY COMMIT TO WORK TOWARD 

2546
07:47:41,533 --> 07:47:42,734
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

2547
07:47:42,734 --> 07:47:43,368
KOREAN PENINSULA.

2548
07:47:43,368 --> 07:47:44,402
THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN THE 

2549
07:47:44,402 --> 07:47:44,602
NORTH.

2550
07:47:44,602 --> 07:47:46,104
THAT MEANS THE SOUTH AS WELL.

2551
07:47:46,104 --> 07:47:48,539
NOW THE U.S. HASN'T HAD NUCLEAR 

2552
07:47:48,539 --> 07:47:50,308
WEAPONS IN SOUTH KOREA ON THE 

2553
07:47:50,308 --> 07:47:52,010
PENINSULA SINCE THE '90S, BUT 

2554
07:47:52,010 --> 07:47:55,546
THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS 

2555
07:47:55,546 --> 07:47:56,180
THERE TO THE ENTIRE PENINSULA 

2556
07:47:56,180 --> 07:47:58,316
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 

2557
07:47:58,316 --> 07:47:58,549
UNPACK.

2558
07:47:58,549 --> 07:47:59,951
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF 

2559
07:47:59,951 --> 07:48:01,219
TIME AND HARD WORK THERE.

2560
07:48:01,219 --> 07:48:03,088
I'M CERTAIN THAT NORTH KOREA WAS

2561
07:48:03,088 --> 07:48:04,789
INTERESTED IN THE PRESENCE OF 

2562
07:48:04,789 --> 07:48:05,891
U.S. BOMBERS.

2563
07:48:05,891 --> 07:48:07,225
THE CHINESE ARE INTERESTED IN 

2564
07:48:07,225 --> 07:48:07,993
THAT AS WELL.

2565
07:48:07,993 --> 07:48:10,028
THEY BELIEVE THE BOMBERS CAN 

2566
07:48:10,028 --> 07:48:11,196
DELIVER BOMBS.

2567
07:48:11,196 --> 07:48:12,297
THAT'S AN OBVIOUS EXTENSION OF 

2568
07:48:12,297 --> 07:48:14,198
THEIR CONCERN AND THEIR SAFETY, 

2569
07:48:14,198 --> 07:48:16,701
SECURITY ISSUES.

2570
07:48:16,701 --> 07:48:18,436
SO IF PRESIDENT TRUMP SEEMINGLY 

2571
07:48:18,436 --> 07:48:20,805
MEANS WHAT HE SAYS, HE HAS MADE 

2572
07:48:20,805 --> 07:48:21,639
CONCESSIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE 

2573
07:48:21,639 --> 07:48:22,507
SECURITY OF THE NORTH.

2574
07:48:22,507 --> 07:48:24,242
AND THE NORTH IN RETURN HAS 

2575
07:48:24,242 --> 07:48:25,443
CONCEDED TO WHAT I KNOW TO BE 

2576
07:48:25,443 --> 07:48:28,146
THE ASKS THAT WE WENT IN TO 

2577
07:48:28,146 --> 07:48:29,414
THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH, THEN I 

2578
07:48:29,414 --> 07:48:31,282
THINK THIS IS JUST TRULY 

2579
07:48:31,282 --> 07:48:31,683
REMARKABLE.

2580
07:48:31,683 --> 07:48:32,950
NOW I KNOW TALK IS CHEAP.

2581
07:48:32,950 --> 07:48:35,353
BUT REMEMBER, WE DIDN'T JUST SAY

2582
07:48:35,353 --> 07:48:35,586
DISARM.

2583
07:48:35,586 --> 07:48:38,390
WE SAID DISARM, DISABLE, 

2584
07:48:38,390 --> 07:48:39,891
DISMANTLE AND THEN PUT IN PLACE 

2585
07:48:39,891 --> 07:48:41,960
A LONG-TERM VERIFICATION 

2586
07:48:41,960 --> 07:48:44,529
PROCESS, WHICH WILL, I ASSUME, 

2587
07:48:44,529 --> 07:48:46,998
HAVE TO INCLUDE THE IAEA, THE 

2588
07:48:46,998 --> 07:48:47,999
ORGANIZATION THAT DOES THIS.

2589
07:48:47,999 --> 07:48:49,767
AND MAYBE EVEN SOME CHINESE 

2590
07:48:49,767 --> 07:48:51,069
SECURITY GUARANTEES.

2591
07:48:51,069 --> 07:48:52,270
SO THIS IS SIGNIFICANT.

2592
07:48:52,270 --> 07:48:54,939
AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE 

2593
07:48:54,939 --> 07:48:56,507
EVERY WORLD LEADER IN THAT 

2594
07:48:56,507 --> 07:48:57,842
REGION SOME TIME TO WORK THROUGH

THOUGH HIS OFFICIAL BIRTH DATE

HIS PLATFORM SHOES AND HIS 

2770
07:58:58,275 --> 07:59:02,245
PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

HE HAS NOW TESTED MORE MISSILES 

2776
07:59:11,856 --> 07:59:14,391

2782
07:59:20,230 --> 07:59:23,167
BOMB, MUCH LARGER THAN THE BOMB

07:59:30,775 --> 07:59:34,812
HE WAS ONE OF THE PALLBEARERS, 

2788
07:59:34,812 --> 07:59:37,915
CRYING AT HIS FATHER'S WAKE.

2789
07:59:37,915 --> 07:59:39,884
IT IS SAID THAT HIS FATHER LOVED

2790
07:59:39,884 --> 07:59:42,052
HIS FEARLESSNESS SHOWN WHEN HE 

2791
07:59:42,052 --> 07:59:43,087
WAS JUST A BOY.

2792
07:59:43,087 --> 07:59:44,688
AND AS NORTH KOREA'S LEADER HE 

2793
07:59:44,688 --> 07:59:46,023
HAS DEMONSTRATED HE IS WILLING 

2794
07:59:46,023 --> 07:59:48,158
TO KILL TO KEEP HIS POWER.

2795
07:59:48,158 --> 07:59:50,093

ORIGINAL HEIR TO THE KIM

BROTHER'S FACE.

2808
08:00:11,548 --> 08:00:13,150
HE WAS DEAD WITHIN MINUTES.

2809
08:00:13,150 --> 08:00:14,919
IT IS THOUGHT HE HAS ALSO KILLED

2810

MORE THAN 140 SENIOR OFFICIALS 

2811
08:00:17,354 --> 08:00:18,789
TO KEEP HIS GRIP ON POWER.

2812
08:00:18,789 --> 08:00:21,292
THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE HAVE 

2813
08:00:21,292 --> 08:00:23,360
STRUGGLED WITH LITTLE FOOD AND 

2814
08:00:23,360 --> 08:00:23,627

CHILDREN AND HIS WIFE IS MORE OF

2851
08:01:37,802 --> 08:01:39,904

TO SOUTH KOREA.

2857
08:01:50,281 --> 08:01:51,983
IT WAS KIM JONG UN WHO SUGGESTED

2858
08:01:51,983 --> 08:01:54,385
SOUTH KOREA SHOULD WALK INTO THE

APPARENTLY, ANYONE AT THE MEDIA 

2878
08:05:30,567 --> 08:05:32,736
CENTER HAD THE PLEASURE OF 

2879
08:05:32,736 --> 08:05:34,572
RECEIVING A FAN WITH KIM JONG UN

SINGAPOREANS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR

2898
08:06:02,466 --> 08:06:03,100

08:06:03,100 --> 08:06:04,468
NOW THEY'VE BRANCHED OUT A

>> NOW I'M HUNGRY.

2918
08:06:44,808 --> 08:06:46,877
>>> AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU 

2919
08:06:46,877 --> 08:06:48,979
RECOGNIZE THESE TWO.

2920
08:06:48,979 --> 08:06:50,014
>> OH, HEY.

2921
08:06:50,014 --> 08:06:55,252
>> SO THOSE ARE IMPERSONATORS.

2922
08:06:55,252 --> 08:06:57,521
HOWARD X AND DENNIS ALLEN AT IT 

2923
08:06:57,521 --> 08:06:57,721

2924
08:06:57,721 --> 08:07:00,491
THEY WERE SEEN ON SATURDAY, 

2925
08:07:00,491 --> 08:07:01,825
BRO-ING IT UP SO TO SPEAK AHEAD 

2926
08:07:01,825 --> 08:07:05,162

2927
08:07:05,162 --> 08:07:11,402
THEY MAY THEY TOURED THE SOUTH N

2928
08:07:11,402 --> 08:07:11,835

2929
08:07:11,835 --> 08:07:14,138
WINTER OLYMPICS AND GOT DETAINED

2930
08:07:14,138 --> 08:07:15,072
AT THE AIRPORT FOR SEVERAL 

2931
08:07:15,072 --> 08:07:16,473
HOURS, AUTHORITIES PERHAPS WERE 

2932
08:07:16,473 --> 08:07:17,941
CONFUSED BY THEIR APPEARANCE.

2933
08:07:17,941 --> 08:07:19,443
>> CONFUSED BY ALL OF THAT?

2934
08:07:19,443 --> 08:07:19,977
LOOK AT THAT.

2935
08:07:19,977 --> 08:07:21,745
THEY'RE HAVING, KIND OF LOOKS 

2936
08:07:21,745 --> 08:07:23,580
LIKE THE SUMMIT ITSELF.

2937
08:07:23,580 --> 08:07:26,083
THEY GOT TO CHECK OUT THE 

2938
08:07:26,083 --> 08:07:27,417
MER-LION, WHICH IS THIS WEIRD 

2939
08:07:27,417 --> 08:07:30,987
THING THEY HAVE, A HALF 

2940
08:07:30,987 --> 08:07:32,556
MERMAID-HALF LION THERE IN 

2941
08:07:32,556 --> 08:07:32,823
SINGAPORE.

2942
08:07:32,823 --> 08:07:34,057
>> THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK THAT 

2943
08:07:34,057 --> 08:07:35,892
MUCH LIKE THE REAL THING, BUT 

2944
08:07:35,892 --> 08:07:38,395
IMAGE OF BOTH OF THEM WALKING 

2945
08:07:38,395 --> 08:07:40,831
TOGETHER, SLAPPING EACH OTHER, 

2946
08:07:40,831 --> 08:07:41,098
EATING.

2947
08:07:41,098 --> 08:07:43,000
IT'S FUNNY.

2948
08:07:43,000 --> 08:07:45,235
>> IFT IS AWESOME.

2949
08:07:45,235 --> 08:07:46,703
SO MUCH HAPPENING IN SINGAPORE.

2950
08:07:46,703 --> 08:07:47,504
LOOK AT THEM.

2951
08:07:47,504 --> 08:07:49,940
>> WHAT'S UP, BRO?

2952
08:07:49,940 --> 08:07:53,276
>> IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO FREAKY 

2953
08:07:53,276 --> 08:07:54,878
FOR MANY PEOPLE TO SEE THE REAL 

2954
08:07:54,878 --> 08:07:55,879
KIM JONG UN WALKING THROUGH THAT

2955
08:07:55,879 --> 08:07:57,014
PARTICULAR AREA LAST NIGHT.

2956
08:07:57,014 --> 08:07:59,015
>> THAT'S TRUE, BECAUSE HE 

2957
08:07:59,015 --> 08:10:17,287
ACTUALLY

2958
08:10:17,287 --> 08:10:19,490
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN,

2959
08:10:19,490 --> 08:10:20,023

PRESIDENT'S INNER CIRCLE.

2964
08:10:26,630 --> 08:10:28,498
>> IT IS TUESDAY MORNING, AND

>> QUITE A BUSY ONE.

2974
08:10:39,243 --> 08:10:40,477
>> WHAT A TUESDAY, WHAT A 

2975
08:10:40,477 --> 08:10:42,479
MORNING IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

2976
08:10:42,479 --> 08:10:43,480
SIX DECADES OF HOSTILITY AT 

2977
08:10:43,480 --> 08:10:44,448
TIMES WITH THE U.S. AND NORTH 

2978
08:10:44,448 --> 08:10:46,550
KOREA ON THE BRINK OF WAR 

2979
08:10:46,550 --> 08:10:47,284
SEEMINGLY COMING TO AN END 

2980
08:10:47,284 --> 08:10:48,385
TODAY.

2981
08:10:48,385 --> 08:10:49,419
>> THE PRESIDENT AND THE NORTH 

2982
08:10:49,419 --> 08:10:52,623
KOREAN DICTATOR KICKED OFF THE 

2983
08:10:52,623 --> 08:10:55,826
MOMENTOUS OCCASION WITH A 

2984
08:10:55,826 --> 08:10:57,094
HANDSHAKE.

2985
08:10:57,094 --> 08:10:59,329
BEFORE HEADING INTO THEIR FIRST 

2986
08:10:59,329 --> 08:10:59,763
ONE ON ONE MEETING.

2987
08:10:59,763 --> 08:11:00,330
>> THE PRESIDENT PREDICTED 

2988
08:11:00,330 --> 08:11:01,398
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND GAVE THAT

2989
08:11:01,398 --> 08:11:02,165
THUMBS UP THAT YOU SEE RIGHT 

2990
08:11:02,165 --> 08:11:03,400
THERE.

2991
08:11:03,400 --> 08:11:04,501
HE'S ALREADY DESCRIBING THEIR 

2992
08:11:04,501 --> 08:11:07,437
RELATIONSHIP AS EXCELLENT.

2993
08:11:07,437 --> 08:11:08,037
MARTHA RADDATZ JOINS US LIVE 

2994
08:11:08,037 --> 08:11:08,404
FROM SINGAPORE.

2995
08:11:08,404 --> 08:11:09,773
GOOD MORNING.

2996
08:11:09,773 --> 08:11:11,742
I KNOW YOU WERE JUST IN SOUTH 

2997
08:11:11,742 --> 08:11:13,043
KOREA AT THE DMZ A FEW MOMENTS 

2998
08:11:13,043 --> 08:11:14,611
AGO.

2999
08:11:14,611 --> 08:11:15,779
YOU SEE ALL OF THIS PLAYING OUT,

3000
08:11:15,779 --> 08:11:19,049
YOUR IMPRESSIONS TODAY.

3001
08:11:19,049 --> 08:11:20,517
>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S QUITE 

3002
08:11:20,517 --> 08:11:21,752
INCREDIBLE TO SEE THOSE 

3003
08:11:21,752 --> 08:11:23,186
PICTURES.

3004
08:11:23,186 --> 08:11:24,955
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT

3005
08:11:24,955 --> 08:11:26,456
IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT LETTER THAT

3006
08:11:26,456 --> 08:11:28,191
THEY SIGNED SAYS.

3007
08:11:28,191 --> 08:11:29,493
WE DO KNOW FROM WHAT HE SAID, 

3008
08:11:29,493 --> 08:11:30,527
THEY HAVE AN EXCELLENT 

3009
08:11:30,527 --> 08:11:31,728
RELATIONSHIP, SO IF YOU THINK 

3010
08:11:31,728 --> 08:11:35,165
BACK BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME

3011
08:11:35,165 --> 08:11:37,968
HERE, HE SAID THE LEAST WE CAN 

3012
08:11:37,968 --> 08:11:38,769
ACCOMPLISH IS MEET, SEE EACH 

3013
08:11:38,769 --> 08:11:39,469
OTHER AND HOPEFULLY LIKE EACH 

3014
08:11:39,469 --> 08:11:40,604
OTHER.

3015
08:11:40,604 --> 08:11:43,040
THAT, THEY GOT FOR SURE.

3016
08:11:43,040 --> 08:11:44,174
BUT THEY CLEARLY ALLUDED TO THE 

3017
08:11:44,174 --> 08:11:45,742
FACT THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE 

3018
08:11:45,742 --> 08:11:46,843
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

3019
08:11:46,843 --> 08:11:47,911
HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE

3020
08:11:47,911 --> 08:11:49,246
OF A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.

3021
08:11:49,246 --> 08:11:50,314
DIDN'T SAY HOW, DIDN'T LAY OUT 

3022
08:11:50,314 --> 08:11:51,782
ANYTHING.

3023
08:11:51,782 --> 08:11:53,283
BUT THE KEY TO ME IS WHEN 

3024
08:11:53,283 --> 08:11:55,118
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE VERY END 

3025
08:11:55,118 --> 08:11:56,920
WHEN HE WALKED AWAY THERE WAS 

3026
08:11:56,920 --> 08:11:58,488
ASKED ABOUT OTHER MEETINGS.

3027
08:11:58,488 --> 08:11:59,890
AND HE SAID THERE WILL BE MANY 

3028
08:11:59,890 --> 08:12:01,725
MORE.

3029
08:12:01,725 --> 08:12:02,893
THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT THEY 

3030
08:12:02,893 --> 08:12:03,827
WANTED, A PROCESS, THAT'S WHAT 

3031
08:12:03,827 --> 08:12:05,462
KIM JONG UN WANTED.

3032
08:12:05,462 --> 08:12:07,030
SO WE WILL SEE IF THEY SAY 

3033
08:12:07,030 --> 08:12:10,167
ANYTHING ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION,

3034
08:12:10,167 --> 08:12:11,535
BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 

3035
08:12:11,535 --> 08:12:13,103
GET REAL SPECIFIC THERE IF THEY 

3036
08:12:13,103 --> 08:12:15,606
HAVE MORE MEETINGS TO COME.

3037
08:12:15,606 --> 08:12:16,740
>> I KNOW THE PRESIDENT SAID 

3038
08:12:16,740 --> 08:12:18,041
WE'LL KNOW VERY QUICKLY.

3039
08:12:18,041 --> 08:12:19,242
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE PORING 

3040
08:12:19,242 --> 08:12:24,514
THROUGH THIS LANGUAGE.

3041
08:12:24,514 --> 08:12:26,950
HE CALLED THIS AN IMPORTANT 

3042
08:12:26,950 --> 08:12:27,450
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.

3043
08:12:27,450 --> 08:12:28,084
WE HEARD FROM KIM JONG UN, THE 

3044
08:12:28,084 --> 08:12:28,652
WORLD WILL SEE MAJOR CHANGE.

3045
08:12:28,652 --> 08:12:31,154
WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS ON 

3046
08:12:31,154 --> 08:12:31,788
BOTH SIDES FOR WHAT THOSE WORDS 

3047
08:12:31,788 --> 08:12:33,056
MEAN?

3048
08:12:33,056 --> 08:12:34,958
>> Reporter: WELL, FOR THE U.S. 

3049
08:12:34,958 --> 08:12:40,831
IS COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 

3050
08:12:40,831 --> 08:12:41,131
IRREVERSIBLE

3051
08:12:41,131 --> 08:12:42,299
DENUCLEARIZATION.

3052
08:12:42,299 --> 08:12:44,134
AND FOR KIM, IT IS SECURITY.

3053
08:12:44,134 --> 08:12:47,037
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THE 

3054
08:12:47,037 --> 08:12:49,306
UNITED STATES WILL HAVE TO 

3055
08:12:49,306 --> 08:12:50,474
VERIFY.

3056
08:12:50,474 --> 08:12:51,341
MIKE POMPEO MADE THAT VERY 

3057
08:12:51,341 --> 08:12:53,410
CLEAR.

3058
08:12:53,410 --> 08:12:55,545
WHATEVER IS THE FINAL AGREEMENT 

3059
08:12:55,545 --> 08:12:58,615
HAS TO HAVE THAT COMPLETE 

3060
08:12:58,615 --> 08:12:59,883
DENUCLEARIZATION.

3061
08:12:59,883 --> 08:13:02,119
KIM JONG UN MAY HAVE A VERY 

3062
08:13:02,119 --> 08:13:03,020
DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF WHAT 

3063
08:13:03,020 --> 08:13:04,554
THAT MEANS.

3064
08:13:04,554 --> 08:13:07,624
HE WANTS TO BE SECURE IF HE DOES

3065
08:13:07,624 --> 08:13:08,157
NOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

3066
08:13:08,157 --> 08:13:10,460
AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE 

3067
08:13:10,460 --> 08:13:14,097
WHO DOUBT THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN,

3068
08:13:14,097 --> 08:13:15,832
BUT WE CAN REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.

3069
08:13:15,832 --> 08:13:18,301
AND THE U.S., OF COURSE, DOESN'T

3070
08:13:18,301 --> 08:13:19,736
TRUST KIM.

3071
08:13:19,736 --> 08:13:21,171
THEY WANT TO VERIFY.

3072
08:13:21,171 --> 08:13:23,106
BUT THIS IS A START.

3073
08:13:23,106 --> 08:13:24,241
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

3074
08:13:24,241 --> 08:13:25,542
THIS IS HISTORIC.

3075
08:13:25,542 --> 08:13:26,777
I THINK THINGS WILL NOT BE THE 

3076
08:13:26,777 --> 08:13:27,811
SAME WITH NORTH KOREA.

3077
08:13:27,811 --> 08:13:29,312
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH THE 

3078
08:13:29,312 --> 08:13:31,748
PRESIDENT LEARNED AND HIS STAFF 

3079
08:13:31,748 --> 08:13:33,884
AND HIS AIDES AND SECRETARY 

3080
08:13:33,884 --> 08:13:36,086
POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON WHO ARE 

3081
08:13:36,086 --> 08:13:37,721
IN THERE ABOUT KIM JONG UN.

3082
08:13:37,721 --> 08:13:41,425
NO ONE KNEW.

3083
08:13:41,425 --> 08:13:43,126
WE SAID ALL DAY THE LAST 

3084
08:13:43,126 --> 08:13:44,494
AMERICAN WHO REALLY TALKED TO 

3085
08:13:44,494 --> 08:13:46,196
HIM BEFORE MIKE POMPEO WAS 

3086
08:13:46,196 --> 08:13:47,731
DENNIS RODMAN.

3087
08:13:47,731 --> 08:13:49,099
DENNIS RODMAN KNEW MORE ABOUT 

3088
08:13:49,099 --> 08:13:51,101
KIM JONG UN THAN ANY OTHER 

3089
08:13:51,101 --> 08:13:52,169
AMERICAN.

3090
08:13:52,169 --> 08:13:53,837
AND NOW WE'VE GOT THIS.

3091
08:13:53,837 --> 08:13:56,039
YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW IN THAT 

3092
08:13:56,039 --> 08:13:56,907
ROOM, THOSE AIDES ARE TAKING 

3093
08:13:56,907 --> 08:13:58,175
NOTES.

3094
08:13:58,175 --> 08:13:59,309
THEY'RE WATCHING KIM JONG UN. 

3095
08:13:59,309 --> 08:14:01,011
>> HOW DOES HE NEGOTIATE?

3096
08:14:01,011 --> 08:14:01,878
DO WE THINK HE'S TELLING THE 

3097
08:14:01,878 --> 08:14:03,613
TRUTH?

3098
08:14:03,613 --> 08:14:07,884
MIKE POMPEO IS READING THE BODY 

3099
08:14:07,884 --> 08:14:12,489
LANGUAGE AND WHAT HE SAYS.

3100
08:14:12,489 --> 08:14:13,824
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO, THIS IS

3101
08:14:13,824 --> 08:14:15,726
THE ART OF THE DEAL PRESIDENT.

3102
08:14:15,726 --> 08:14:17,561
HE KNOWS HOW TO WALK IN A ROOM 

3103
08:14:17,561 --> 08:14:19,196
AND GET A DEAL AND KNOWS WHAT TO

3104
08:14:19,196 --> 08:14:20,297
LOOK FOR AND WHAT TO LOOK OUT 

3105
08:14:20,297 --> 08:14:22,065
FOR.

3106
08:14:22,065 --> 08:14:23,266
>> POINTING OUT THAT WE BARELY 

3107
08:14:23,266 --> 08:14:24,568
EVEN HEARD KIM JONG UN'S VOICE 

3108
08:14:24,568 --> 08:14:25,869
PRIOR TO THIS MORNING.

3109
08:14:25,869 --> 08:14:27,037
IT WAS STRIKING TO HEAR IT.

3110
08:14:27,037 --> 08:14:29,272
MARTHA RADDATZ IN SINGAPORE.

3111
08:14:29,272 --> 08:14:31,108
WE APPRECIATE IT, MARTHA.

3112
08:14:31,108 --> 08:14:33,477
>> THANK YOU.

3113
08:14:33,477 --> 08:14:35,078
>>> LET'S TURN NOW TO OUR 

3114
08:14:35,078 --> 08:14:43,720
CONTRIBUTOR, RETIRED COLONEL 

3115
08:14:43,720 --> 08:14:46,255
STEVE GANYARD.

3116
08:14:46,255 --> 08:14:46,789
>> SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT, 

3117
08:14:46,789 --> 08:14:48,525
PROMISING MAJOR CHANGE.

3118
08:14:48,525 --> 08:14:49,559
CAN A DEAL BE TRUSTED, THOUGH?

3119
08:14:49,559 --> 08:14:51,294
THEY BOTH SEEM INCREDIBLY 

3120
08:14:51,294 --> 08:14:54,531
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT JUST 

3121
08:14:54,531 --> 08:14:55,565
HAPPENED, BUT WHAT DO WE FOCUS 

3122
08:14:55,565 --> 08:14:55,798
ON NOW?

3123
08:14:55,798 --> 08:14:57,300
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT 

3124
08:14:57,300 --> 08:14:58,068
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY NUKES 

3125
08:14:58,068 --> 08:14:59,469
THEY HAVE.

3126
08:14:59,469 --> 08:15:01,037
SO WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER THAT

3127
08:15:01,037 --> 08:15:01,872
WE'RE GOING TO COUNT THEN IT'S 

3128
08:15:01,872 --> 08:15:04,708
HARD TO COUNT THAT NUMBER.

3129
08:15:04,708 --> 08:15:05,609
SO FINDING WAYS TO DO THIS IS 

3130
08:15:05,609 --> 08:15:06,376
GOING TO TAKE QUITE A WHILE.

3131
08:15:06,376 --> 08:15:08,145
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT 

3132
08:15:08,145 --> 08:15:09,179
OF TIME AND NEGOTIATION.

3133
08:15:09,179 --> 08:15:10,080
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL 

3134
08:15:10,080 --> 08:15:11,815
HAPPEN OVER MONTHS IF NOT YEARS 

3135
08:15:11,815 --> 08:15:14,084
TO COME TO THE FINAL DETAILS OF 

3136
08:15:14,084 --> 08:15:16,453
THIS AGREEMENT.

3137
08:15:16,453 --> 08:15:17,053
BUT I'M SITTING HERE WATCHING 

3138
08:15:17,053 --> 08:15:17,954
SOMEBODY WHO SPENT MOST OF MY 

3139
08:15:17,954 --> 08:15:22,459
CAREER THINKING ABOUT THE THREAT

3140
08:15:22,459 --> 08:15:24,227
FROM THE NORTH AND THE HUNDREDS 

3141
08:15:24,227 --> 08:15:25,395
OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO 

3142
08:15:25,395 --> 08:15:26,530
HAVE SERVED IN UNIFORM IN THE 

3143
08:15:26,530 --> 08:15:27,430
PACIFIC WHERE NORTH KOREA WAS 

3144
08:15:27,430 --> 08:15:28,532
THE THREAT.

3145
08:15:28,532 --> 08:15:29,733
AND HERE YOU HAVE THESE TWO MEN 

3146
08:15:29,733 --> 08:15:32,102
SITTING TOGETHER.

3147
08:15:32,102 --> 08:15:32,936
IT IS, WHETHER IT TURNS OUT 

3148
08:15:32,936 --> 08:15:34,104
RIGHT OR WRONG, IT'S STILL AN 

3149
08:15:34,104 --> 08:15:35,806
EXTRAORDINARY SCENE.

3150
08:15:35,806 --> 08:15:37,107
>> NOW STEVE, TWO MONTHS AGO YOU

3151
08:15:37,107 --> 08:15:38,942
SAID THAT YOU WERE SKEPTICAL 

3152
08:15:38,942 --> 08:15:39,876
THAT THEY WOULD BREAK EVERY 

3153
08:15:39,876 --> 08:15:41,545
PROMISE THEY MADE.

3154
08:15:41,545 --> 08:15:43,713
HE SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT 

3155
08:15:43,713 --> 08:15:44,246
JUST TRUST AND VERIFY BUT 

3156
08:15:44,246 --> 08:15:45,782
DISTRUST AND VERIFY.

3157
08:15:45,782 --> 08:15:47,450
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY AFTER 

3158
08:15:47,450 --> 08:15:48,952
SEEING THESE PICTURES?

3159
08:15:48,952 --> 08:15:51,555
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO.

3160
08:15:51,555 --> 08:15:53,390
WE'VE BEEN BURNED IN THE PAST.

3161
08:15:53,390 --> 08:15:55,892
AND UNTIL THEY SHOW SOMETHING 

3162
08:15:55,892 --> 08:15:57,727
DIFFERENT, THEN WE NEED TO, THEN

3163
08:15:57,727 --> 08:15:59,729
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TRUST NO 

3164
08:15:59,729 --> 08:16:01,164
ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN 

3165
08:16:01,164 --> 08:16:02,899
VERIFY EVERYTHING THAT WE AGREE 

3166
08:16:02,899 --> 08:16:04,167
TO.

3167
08:16:04,167 --> 08:16:05,302
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING 

3168
08:16:05,302 --> 08:16:07,070
THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO

3169
08:16:07,070 --> 08:16:08,638
SEE SOME CHANGES, AND I THINK 

3170
08:16:08,638 --> 08:16:10,774
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME TRUE 

3171
08:16:10,774 --> 08:16:11,808
MOVEMENT FORWARD, BUT IT'S ALL 

3172
08:16:11,808 --> 08:16:12,909
GOING TO PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT 

3173
08:16:12,909 --> 08:16:14,744
MONTHS IF NOT YEARS, HOPEFULLY 

3174
08:16:14,744 --> 08:16:16,646
BRINGING PEACE AND REUNIFICATION

3175
08:16:16,646 --> 08:16:18,281
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

3176
08:16:18,281 --> 08:16:19,182
>> ALL RIGHT, SO MANY HOPING FOR

3177
08:16:19,182 --> 08:16:20,317
THAT THIS MORNING.

3178
08:16:20,317 --> 08:16:24,254
STEVE GANYARD FOR US THANK YOU.

3179
08:16:24,254 --> 08:16:25,188
>> OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO 

3180
08:16:25,188 --> 08:16:26,957
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ALL THE 

3181
08:16:26,957 --> 08:16:31,127
DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING IN 

3182
08:16:31,127 --> 08:16:31,761
SINGAPORE, IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

3183
08:16:31,761 --> 08:16:34,331
AS WELL AS WELL AS NORTH KOREA.

3184
08:16:34,331 --> 08:16:35,732
>> THE WORLD IS WATCHING THIS.

3185
08:16:35,732 --> 08:16:37,400
NOT ONLY ARE THE STAKES VERY 

3186
08:16:37,400 --> 08:16:38,501
HIGH FOR THE UNITED STATES, 

3187
08:16:38,501 --> 08:16:39,970
WE'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 

3188
08:16:39,970 --> 08:16:40,804
TALKING ABOUT IT FOR QUITE SOME 

3189
08:16:40,804 --> 08:16:41,905
TIME NOW.

3190
08:16:41,905 --> 08:16:43,440
AND THIS IS TWO LEADERS WHO WENT

3191
08:16:43,440 --> 08:16:44,307
FROM SEEMINGLY ON THE BRINK OF 

3192
08:16:44,307 --> 08:16:47,978
WAR.

3193
08:16:47,978 --> 08:16:50,547
TO NOW STRIKING A DEAL.

3194
08:16:50,547 --> 08:16:51,981
HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR SOUTH 

3195
08:16:51,981 --> 08:16:53,016
KOREA AS WELL.

3196
08:16:53,016 --> 08:16:55,151
THIS COULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE 

3197
08:16:55,151 --> 08:16:55,418
PENINSULA.

3198
08:16:55,418 --> 08:16:56,052
>> WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT ASKED,

3199
08:16:56,052 --> 08:16:56,619
WOULD YOU INVITE HIM TO THE 

3200
08:16:56,619 --> 08:16:57,220
WHITE HOUSE, AND HE SAID YES.

3201
08:16:57,220 --> 08:16:57,787
>> ABSOLUTELY.

3202
08:16:57,787 --> 08:17:02,158
>> ABSOLUTELY YES.

3203
08:17:02,158 --> 08:17:02,792

THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA IN

08:44:31,640 --> 08:44:33,441
THIS CASE DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN, 

3222
08:44:33,441 --> 08:44:35,577
THE PRESIDENT A SHORT TIME AGO 

3223
08:44:35,577 --> 08:44:36,377

GEORGE, PRESSING THE PRESIDENT 

3227
08:44:40,548 --> 08:44:44,152
HOW WILL HE VERIFY COMPLETE 

3228
08:44:44,152 --> 08:44:44,685
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THE 

3229
08:44:44,685 --> 08:44:45,820
PRESIDENT SAID THAT WILL BE 

3230
08:44:45,820 --> 08:44:46,988
WORKED OUT BUT THAT THEY WILL 

3231
08:44:46,988 --> 08:44:49,558
FIND WAYS TO VERIFY, LOOKING 

3232
08:44:49,558 --> 08:44:51,459
BACK TO RONALD REAGAN'S WORDS 

3233
08:44:51,459 --> 08:44:53,895

I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE ROOM.

3237
08:44:57,265 --> 08:45:01,335
YOU CAN SEE IT, CAPPELLA HOTEL, 

3238
08:45:01,335 --> 08:45:02,671
SENTOSA ISLAND WHERE HE MET WITH

08:45:02,671 --> 08:45:05,240

OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 

3245
08:45:10,344 --> 08:45:12,948
CORRESPONDENT AND, JON, SO MANY 

3246
08:45:12,948 --> 08:45:14,616
QUESTIONS STILL UNANSWERED BUT 

3247
08:45:14,616 --> 08:45:17,719
NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS TRULY 

3248
08:45:17,719 --> 08:45:26,494
HISTORIC IN NATURE.

3249
08:45:26,494 --> 08:45:28,263
AND, JON, IN THAT ROOM 

3250
08:45:28,263 --> 08:45:29,698
APPARENTLY HE CAN'T HEAR US, 

3251
08:45:29,698 --> 08:45:30,531
PROBABLY IN POSITION GIVEN THE 

3252
08:45:30,531 --> 08:45:31,666
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 

3253
08:45:31,666 --> 08:45:33,568
EXPECTED TO TALK SHORTLY BUT, 

3254
08:45:33,568 --> 08:45:35,070
MARTHA RADDATZ, OUR CHIEF GLOBAL

3255
08:45:35,070 --> 08:45:36,938
AFFAIRS ANCHOR WHO HAS BEEN 

3256
08:45:36,938 --> 08:45:38,473
WATCHING IT UNFOLD WITH ME IN 

3257
08:45:38,473 --> 08:45:39,974
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS FOR THOSE 

3258
08:45:39,974 --> 08:45:41,542
WATCHING BACK IN THE U.S., THE 

3259
08:45:41,542 --> 08:45:43,378
KEY HURDLE HERE IS GOING TO BE 

3260
08:45:43,378 --> 08:45:44,479
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHICH IS

3261
08:45:44,479 --> 08:45:48,349
WE MUST VERIFY, WE WILL VERIFY 

3262
08:45:48,349 --> 08:45:49,016
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION, BUT 

3263
08:45:49,016 --> 08:45:50,285
HOW DO YOU DO THAT. 

3264
08:45:50,285 --> 08:45:51,720
>> HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

3265
08:45:51,720 --> 08:45:52,487
YOU CHECK.

3266
08:45:52,487 --> 08:45:52,787
YOU RECHECK.

3267
08:45:52,787 --> 08:45:53,988
YOU HAVE A WHOLE PROGRAM HERE 

3268
08:45:53,988 --> 08:45:55,489
WHERE YOU GET RID OF THE 

3269
08:45:55,489 --> 08:45:58,093
WEAPONS, FIRST OF ALL, IN A 

3270
08:45:58,093 --> 08:45:58,493
PHASED BASIS.

3271
08:45:58,493 --> 08:46:00,361
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU ALSO HAVE 

3272
08:46:00,361 --> 08:46:02,263
TO LOOK OUT HERE FOR, DAVID, IS 

3273
08:46:02,263 --> 08:46:04,099
EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID,

3274
08:46:04,099 --> 08:46:04,499
TRUST.

3275
08:46:04,499 --> 08:46:07,135
YOU REALLY CAN'T TRUST.

3276
08:46:07,135 --> 08:46:07,735
THE PRESIDENT MAY TRUST KIM 

3277
08:46:07,735 --> 08:46:11,206
JONG-UN BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST.

3278
08:46:11,206 --> 08:46:11,773
YOU HAVE TO VERIFY AND THE 

3279
08:46:11,773 --> 08:46:12,507
UNITED STATES HAS SAID THAT 

3280
08:46:12,507 --> 08:46:14,442
AGAIN AND AGAIN NOT JUST VERIFY 

3281
08:46:14,442 --> 08:46:16,644
BUT IRREVERSIBLE 

3282
08:46:16,644 --> 08:46:17,045
DENUCLEARIZATION.

3283
08:46:17,045 --> 08:46:19,247
WHAT YOU ALSO HAD IN THAT 

3284
08:46:19,247 --> 08:46:21,382
STATEMENT IS THE PRESIDENT AND 

3285
08:46:21,382 --> 08:46:22,517
KIM JONG-UN SAYING THAT THE 

3286
08:46:22,517 --> 08:46:25,754
PRESIDENT COMMITTED TO PROVIDE 

3287
08:46:25,754 --> 08:46:27,555
SECURITY GUARANTEES TO NORTH 

3288
08:46:27,555 --> 08:46:29,557
KOREA, THAT'S KEY HERE, THAT'S 

3289
08:46:29,557 --> 08:46:31,760
EXACTLY WHAT KIM JONG-UN WANTED.

3290
08:46:31,760 --> 08:46:32,694
HE FELT THREATENED.

3291
08:46:32,694 --> 08:46:34,629
THAT'S WHY HE GOT THOSE NUCLEAR 

3292
08:46:34,629 --> 08:46:35,263
WEAPONS TO BEGIN WITH.

3293
08:46:35,263 --> 08:46:38,299
SO HE COULD NEGOTIATE TO A DAY 

3294
08:46:38,299 --> 08:46:39,000
LIKE TODAY. 

3295
08:46:39,000 --> 08:46:40,068
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THE 

3296
08:46:40,068 --> 08:46:41,770
PRESIDENT WILL LIKELY BE ASKED 

3297
08:46:41,770 --> 08:46:44,004
ABOUT MOMENTS FROM NOW, HOW DO 

3298
08:46:44,004 --> 08:46:45,540
WE PROVIDE THAT SECURITY AND 

3299
08:46:45,540 --> 08:46:46,941
WHAT DOES THAT SECURITY LOOK 

3300
08:46:46,941 --> 08:46:47,509
LIKE?

3301
08:46:47,509 --> 08:46:49,310
DOES THAT KEEP KIM JONG-UN IN 

3302
08:46:49,310 --> 08:46:51,479
POWER FOR YEARS, DECADES TO 

3303
08:46:51,479 --> 08:46:51,679
COME?

3304
08:46:51,679 --> 08:46:52,713
>> WELL, HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T 

3305
08:46:52,713 --> 08:46:54,149
MENTION HIM BY NAME.

3306
08:46:54,149 --> 08:46:56,584
HE TALKED ABOUT SECURITY FOR THE

3307
08:46:56,584 --> 08:46:56,784
DPRK.

3308
08:46:56,784 --> 08:46:58,787
HE TALKED ABOUT SECURITY FOR 

3309
08:46:58,787 --> 08:46:59,421
NORTH KOREA.

3310
08:46:59,421 --> 08:47:01,222
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

3311
08:47:01,222 --> 08:47:02,790
MIKE POMPEO SAID IT'S A UNIQUE 

3312
08:47:02,790 --> 08:47:05,360
KIND OF SECURITY AGREEMENT.

3313
08:47:05,360 --> 08:47:06,794
WE, FRANKLY, DON'T KNOW EXACTLY 

3314
08:47:06,794 --> 08:47:08,363
WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW THEY 

3315
08:47:08,363 --> 08:47:09,898
WILL PROVIDE THAT SECURITY.

3316
08:47:09,898 --> 08:47:12,500
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO

3317
08:47:12,500 --> 08:47:14,902
WE WERE THREATENING ANNIHILATE 

3318
08:47:14,902 --> 08:47:17,272
NORTH KOREA IF THEY DARED LAUNCH

3319
08:47:17,272 --> 08:47:19,641
ANY SORT OF NUCLEAR WEAPON OR 

3320
08:47:19,641 --> 08:47:20,508
THREATEN THE UNITED STATES, 

3321
08:47:20,508 --> 08:47:22,644
REMEMBER, THE INCIDENT WITH 

3322
08:47:22,644 --> 08:47:23,811
GUAM, HE WAS PROMISING MISSILES 

3323
08:47:23,811 --> 08:47:26,781
WOULD BE SHOT TOWARDS GUAM AND 

3324
08:47:26,781 --> 08:47:29,350
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST 

3325
08:47:29,350 --> 08:47:31,152
INTENSE PERIOD FOR FEARS THERE 

3326
08:47:31,152 --> 08:47:34,622
WOULD BE SOME COSORT OF CONFLIC 

3327
08:47:34,622 --> 08:47:35,757
>> WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN 

3328
08:47:35,757 --> 08:47:37,058
AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST WITH 

3329
08:47:37,058 --> 08:47:38,760
NORTH KOREA BACK DURING 

3330
08:47:38,760 --> 08:47:40,428
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S TIME.

3331
08:47:40,428 --> 08:47:41,996
THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT REACHED 

3332
08:47:41,996 --> 08:47:43,998
IN PRINCIPLE THAT FELL APART NOT

3333
08:47:43,998 --> 08:47:45,299
LONG AFTER WHEN KIM JONG-UN'S 

3334
08:47:45,299 --> 08:47:46,200
FATHER DIED A SHORT TIME AFTER 

3335
08:47:46,200 --> 08:47:47,735
THAT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED.

3336
08:47:47,735 --> 08:47:49,203
IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU SEE THOSE 

3337
08:47:49,203 --> 08:47:50,738
WORDS AND, IN FACT, IT'S IN THE 

3338
08:47:50,738 --> 08:47:52,206
FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS LETTER 

3339
08:47:52,206 --> 08:47:53,975
SIGNED JOINTLY BY THESE TWO 

3340
08:47:53,975 --> 08:47:55,944
LEADERS A SHORT TIME AGO HERE IN

3341
08:47:55,944 --> 08:47:57,345
SINGAPORE SAYING THAT CHAIRMAN 

3342
08:47:57,345 --> 08:47:58,412
KIM JONG-UN HAS REAFFIRMED HIS 

3343
08:47:58,412 --> 08:48:01,082
FIRM AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT 

3344
08:48:01,082 --> 08:48:03,084
TO COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 

3345
08:48:03,084 --> 08:48:04,486
THE KOREAN PENINSULA, I MEAN, 

3346
08:48:04,486 --> 08:48:06,621
THERE ISN'T MUCH ROOM FOR AN 

3347
08:48:06,621 --> 08:48:08,523
OPENING THERE, COMPLETE 

3348
08:48:08,523 --> 08:48:09,090
DENUCLEARIZATION IS WHAT 

3349
08:48:09,090 --> 08:48:10,725
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO SAID 

3350
08:48:10,725 --> 08:48:12,860
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS AND WHAT 

3351
08:48:12,860 --> 08:48:13,928
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID LEADING

3352
08:48:13,928 --> 08:48:15,463
UP TO THE SUMMIT THAT WAS 

3353
08:48:15,463 --> 08:48:17,064
CANCELED THEN BACK ON BUT THIS 

3354
08:48:17,064 --> 08:48:18,733
IS ALWAYS BEEN THE GROUNDS FOR 

3355
08:48:18,733 --> 08:48:19,267
AN AGREEMENT. 

3356
08:48:19,267 --> 08:48:20,168
>> Reporter: IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

3357
08:48:20,168 --> 08:48:22,036
THE REASON WE ARE HERE TODAY, 

3358
08:48:22,036 --> 08:48:23,304
THE REASON PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME 

3359
08:48:23,304 --> 08:48:25,606
TO THIS MEETING, THE REASON FOR 

3360
08:48:25,606 --> 08:48:28,375
THIS SUMMIT IS DENUCLEARIZATION 

3361
08:48:28,375 --> 08:48:30,145
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA, OF 

3362
08:48:30,145 --> 08:48:30,678
NORTH KOREA.

3363
08:48:30,678 --> 08:48:32,180
>> WE ARE ON THE AIR IN THE 

3364
08:48:32,180 --> 08:48:33,648
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BACK HOME, 

3365
08:48:33,648 --> 08:48:35,350
4:08 IN THE MORNING IN THE EAST,

3366
08:48:35,350 --> 08:48:39,020
WE'RE 12 HOUR AS HEAD IN 

3367
08:48:39,020 --> 08:48:39,387
SINGAPORE.

3368
08:48:39,387 --> 08:48:40,388
DIE WANT

3369
08:48:40,388 --> 08:48:41,155
 I DO WANT TO BRING IN JUJU 

3370
08:48:41,155 --> 08:48:42,456
CHANG MONITORING THESE 

3371
08:48:42,456 --> 08:48:43,658
DEVELOPMENTS WITH US HERE IN 

3372
08:48:43,658 --> 08:48:45,927
SINGAPORE BACK IN OUR NEW YORK 

3373
08:48:45,927 --> 08:48:48,496
STUDIO AND, JUJU, I'M CURIOUS, 

3374
08:48:48,496 --> 08:48:49,664
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT 

3375
08:48:49,664 --> 08:48:52,033
MOON IN SOUTH KOREA AND THIS 

3376
08:48:52,033 --> 08:48:53,835
CABINET WATCHING AS THE EVENTS 

3377
08:48:53,835 --> 08:48:55,203
UNFOLDED HERE SMILING WITH THAT 

3378
08:48:55,203 --> 08:48:57,472
FIRST HANDSHAKE, BUT EVEN HE 

3379
08:48:57,472 --> 08:48:58,639
COULD NOT HAVE PREDICTED HOW 

3380
08:48:58,639 --> 08:49:00,541
THIS WOULD HAVE UNFOLDED TODAY 

3381
08:49:00,541 --> 08:49:02,243
AND I KNOW THAT THE SECRETARY OF

3382
08:49:02,243 --> 08:49:05,379
STATE NOW TRAVELS TO MEET WITH 

3383
08:49:05,379 --> 08:49:06,480
PRESIDENT MOON NEXT TO FILL HIM 

3384
08:49:06,480 --> 08:49:09,250
IN ON HOW THIS, THEY BELIEVE, 

3385
08:49:09,250 --> 08:49:11,619
WILL UNFOLD IN THE COMING WEEKS,

3386
08:49:11,619 --> 08:49:12,353
MONTHS, YEARS TO COME. 

3387
08:49:12,353 --> 08:49:15,122
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 

3388
08:49:15,122 --> 08:49:15,723
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING 

3389
08:49:15,723 --> 08:49:17,358
DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAPPENED SO 

3390
08:49:17,358 --> 08:49:17,625
QUICKLY.

3391
08:49:17,625 --> 08:49:19,160
THE SPEED WITH WHICH PEACE BROKE

3392
08:49:19,160 --> 08:49:20,728
OUT ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, IF 

3393
08:49:20,728 --> 08:49:23,431
YOU WILL, IT HAS BEEN WILDLY 

3394
08:49:23,431 --> 08:49:26,701
POPULAR IN SOUTH KOREA ENJOYING 

3395
08:49:26,701 --> 08:49:28,503
80% APPROVAL RATINGS IN SOME 

3396
08:49:28,503 --> 08:49:30,304
SECTORS, BUT THERE IS STILL A 

3397
08:49:30,304 --> 08:49:32,907
VERY DEEP RESERVOIR OF DISTRUST 

3398
08:49:32,907 --> 08:49:34,809
BUILT UP OVER DECADES OF 

3399
08:49:34,809 --> 08:49:36,177
BETRAYALS AS YOU ALLUDED TO AND 

3400
08:49:36,177 --> 08:49:38,713
BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE WITH 

3401
08:49:38,713 --> 08:49:39,680
SUBSEQUENT AMERICAN 

3402
08:49:39,680 --> 08:49:41,082
ADMINISTRATIONS STRIKING DEALS 

3403
08:49:41,082 --> 08:49:43,017
WITH KIM JONG-UN'S FATHER AND 

3404
08:49:43,017 --> 08:49:44,285
HIS GRANDFATHER BEFORE THAT.

3405
08:49:44,285 --> 08:49:47,188
THEY'VE MADE AGREEMENTS TO 

3406
08:49:47,188 --> 08:49:49,290
DENUCLEARIZE, AGREEMENTS BEFORE 

3407
08:49:49,290 --> 08:49:50,491
TO STRIKE AT PEACE AND WE'VE 

3408
08:49:50,491 --> 08:49:52,760
EVEN HAD A PREVIOUS SOUTH KOREAN

3409
08:49:52,760 --> 08:49:54,929
PRESIDENT KIM DAE-JUNG WIN A 

3410
08:49:54,929 --> 08:49:56,497
NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS EFFORTS 

3411
08:49:56,497 --> 08:49:58,900
TOWARDS PEACE ONLY TO HAVE THEM 

3412
08:49:58,900 --> 08:49:59,167
UNRAVEL.

3413
08:49:59,167 --> 08:50:01,235
NOW, THE IRONIC TWIST IS THAT 

3414
08:50:01,235 --> 08:50:04,172
THIS SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON

3415
08:50:04,172 --> 08:50:06,074
JAE-IN HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT'S 

3416
08:50:06,074 --> 08:50:08,242
DONALD TRUMP WHO DESERVES THE 

3417
08:50:08,242 --> 08:50:09,744
NOBEL PRIZE WHICH IS FASCINATING

3418
08:50:09,744 --> 08:50:12,213
TO ME ON SOME LEVELS, A 

3419
08:50:12,213 --> 08:50:12,981
KOREAN-AMERICAN, IT SAYS IF HE'S

3420
08:50:12,981 --> 08:50:14,815
THE MODERN-DAY, YOU KNOW, 

3421
08:50:14,815 --> 08:50:16,951
GENERAL DOUGLAS McARTHUR COMING 

3422
08:50:16,951 --> 08:50:18,887
TO SAVE KOREA FROM TYRANNY WHICH

3423
08:50:18,887 --> 08:50:21,089
IS IN MANY WAYS AN ASTONISHING 

3424
08:50:21,089 --> 08:50:23,791
DEVELOPMENT.

3425
08:50:23,791 --> 08:50:25,093
>> IT IS, JUJU.

3426
08:50:25,093 --> 08:50:25,927
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HIMSELF 

3427
08:50:25,927 --> 08:50:29,063
THAT HE'S BEEN LONG INTERESTED 

3428
08:50:29,063 --> 08:50:30,531
IN BEING PART OF THE 

3429
08:50:30,531 --> 08:50:33,000
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WOULD HELP 

3430
08:50:33,000 --> 08:50:34,535
TAKE CARE OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

3431
08:50:34,535 --> 08:50:35,837
THAT STILL EXIST IN OUR WORLD.

3432
08:50:35,837 --> 08:50:37,738
HE SAID HE'S WATCHED IT SINCE 

3433
08:50:37,738 --> 08:50:40,241
THE '80s PLAYING OUT WHEN RONALD

3434
08:50:40,241 --> 08:50:42,710
REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT AND WE 

3435
08:50:42,710 --> 08:50:44,112
WITNESSED SOMETHING 

3436
08:50:44,112 --> 08:50:45,146
EXTRAORDINARY TODAY WHERE AT 

3437
08:50:45,146 --> 08:50:47,615
LEAST FOR NOW WE HAVE THE 

3438
08:50:47,615 --> 08:50:48,683
BLUEPRINT FOR WHAT COULD BE 

3439
08:50:48,683 --> 08:50:49,984
PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 

3440
08:50:49,984 --> 08:50:51,085
>> ABSOLUTELY.

3441
08:50:51,085 --> 08:50:52,320
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE KIM JONG-UN 

3442
08:50:52,320 --> 08:50:54,555
CAME TO THIS SUMMIT WITH AN EYE 

3443
08:50:54,555 --> 08:50:55,756
TOWARDS JOINING THE 

3444
08:50:55,756 --> 08:50:57,058
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND AT 

3445
08:50:57,058 --> 08:50:58,559
LEAST ECONOMICALLY AND THAT THIS

3446
08:50:58,559 --> 08:51:00,094
LETTER, THIS AGREEMENT IS REALLY

3447
08:51:00,094 --> 08:51:02,029
HIS TICKET INTO THE CLUB AND 

3448
08:51:02,029 --> 08:51:03,164
SANCTIONS MAY NOT BE ON THE 

3449
08:51:03,164 --> 08:51:04,398
TABLE AND MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN 

3450
08:51:04,398 --> 08:51:05,900
THE NEGOTIATIONS, BUT THAT'S 

3451
08:51:05,900 --> 08:51:08,536
CLEARLY ON THE REGIME'S MIND, IF

3452
08:51:08,536 --> 08:51:10,438
YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC GAPS 

3453
08:51:10,438 --> 08:51:11,973
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH 

3454
08:51:11,973 --> 08:51:13,641
KOREA, SOUTH KOREA IS NOW THE 

3455
08:51:13,641 --> 08:51:15,810
11th OR 12th LARGEST ECONOMY 

3456
08:51:15,810 --> 08:51:16,978
DEPENDING ON WHICH LIST YOU LOOK

3457
08:51:16,978 --> 08:51:19,213
AT AND NORTH KOREA IS 125th.

3458
08:51:19,213 --> 08:51:21,082
IT IS IN THE CELLAR AND THAT IS 

3459
08:51:21,082 --> 08:51:23,284
NOT WHERE IT WAS 50 YEARS AGO, 

3460
08:51:23,284 --> 08:51:25,253
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT

3461
08:51:25,253 --> 08:51:28,222
AND SO THIS IS AN ECONOMIC 

3462
08:51:28,222 --> 08:51:30,425
DISPARITY THAT KIM JONG-UN IS 

3463
08:51:30,425 --> 08:51:33,861
CERTAINLY HOPING TO CHANGE.

3464
08:51:33,861 --> 08:51:35,229
>> AND, JUJU, STICK WITH US 

3465
08:51:35,229 --> 08:51:36,564
HERE, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE 

3466
08:51:36,564 --> 08:51:37,899
WATCHING BACK HOME AS THIS 

3467
08:51:37,899 --> 08:51:39,066
UNFOLDS WE ARE AWAITING THE 

3468
08:51:39,066 --> 08:51:40,234
PRESIDENT AND WILL TAKE 

3469
08:51:40,234 --> 08:51:40,834
QUESTIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL 

3470
08:51:40,834 --> 08:51:42,403
REPORTERS BUT WANTED TO GET BACK

3471
08:51:42,403 --> 08:51:43,905
TO JUJU BECAUSE FOR MANY PEOPLE 

3472
08:51:43,905 --> 08:51:45,072
NOT ONLY BACK IN THE U.S. BUT 

3473
08:51:45,072 --> 08:51:46,407
AROUND THE WORLD I'M SURE IT'S 

3474
08:51:46,407 --> 08:51:49,711
ALSO A DAY OF TRYING TO 

3475
08:51:49,711 --> 08:51:50,845
RECONCILE THE PERSON THEY KNEW 

3476
08:51:50,845 --> 08:51:52,646
AS A BRUTAL DICTATOR, SOMEONE 

3477
08:51:52,646 --> 08:51:54,382
WHO PRESIDED OVER A COUNTRY WITH

3478
08:51:54,382 --> 08:51:56,484
ROLLING BLACKOUTS, WITH PEOPLE 

3479
08:51:56,484 --> 08:51:58,752
NEAR STARVATION, IN DESPERATE 

3480
08:51:58,752 --> 08:52:00,755
NEED OF FOOD IN SOME CASES, A 

3481
08:52:00,755 --> 08:52:02,357
LEADER WHO KILLED MEMBERS OF HIS

3482
08:52:02,357 --> 08:52:04,926
OWN FAMILY TO KEEP HIS GRIP ON 

3483
08:52:04,926 --> 08:52:05,293
POWER.

3484
08:52:05,293 --> 08:52:06,594
AND NOW JUST SINCE THE BEGINNING

3485
08:52:06,594 --> 08:52:08,396
OF THIS YEAR THE OLIVE BRANCH TO

3486
08:52:08,396 --> 08:52:10,631
THE SOUTH, PRESIDENT MOON TAKING

3487
08:52:10,631 --> 08:52:12,533
NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION TO THE 

3488
08:52:12,533 --> 08:52:14,502
OLYMPICS AND THIS FACE-TO-FACE 

3489
08:52:14,502 --> 08:52:15,202
MEETING NOW WITH PRESIDENT 

3490
08:52:15,202 --> 08:52:15,770
TRUMP.

3491
08:52:15,770 --> 08:52:18,272
THIS HAS ONLY BEEN RELATIVELY 

3492
08:52:18,272 --> 08:52:19,807
NEW FOR KIM JONG-UN, THE 

3493
08:52:19,807 --> 08:52:21,676
DIPLOMAT, AND IT COMES AFTER 

3494
08:52:21,676 --> 08:52:23,744
YEARS AS A RUTHLESS DICTATOR IN 

3495
08:52:23,744 --> 08:52:24,578
NORTH KOREA. 

3496
08:52:24,578 --> 08:52:25,780
>> ABSOLUTELY, DAVID.

3497
08:52:25,780 --> 08:52:27,214
WHEN I WAS IN SEOUL MOST 

3498
08:52:27,214 --> 08:52:29,484
RECENTLY BEFORE THE KOREA 

3499
08:52:29,484 --> 08:52:30,918
OLYMPICS, A LOT OF THE DEFECTORS

3500
08:52:30,918 --> 08:52:32,987
FROM NORTH KOREA WERE TELLING ME

3501
08:52:32,987 --> 08:52:34,655
THIS IS A REGIME THAT IS KNOWN 

3502
08:52:34,655 --> 08:52:36,190
IN THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN 

3503
08:52:36,190 --> 08:52:38,759
RIGHTS COMMUNITY AS IMPRISONING 

3504
08:52:38,759 --> 08:52:40,961
IN GULAGS MORE THAN 100,000 

3505
08:52:40,961 --> 08:52:44,432
NORTH KOREANS, TORTURING, 

3506
08:52:44,432 --> 08:52:45,333
EXECUTING, STARVING ITS CITIZENS

3507
08:52:45,333 --> 08:52:47,668
AND SO THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE AS 

3508
08:52:47,668 --> 08:52:49,403
JON KARL HAS NOTED FROM SENIOR 

3509
08:52:49,403 --> 08:52:50,871
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS THAT IS 

3510
08:52:50,871 --> 08:52:52,807
NOT ON THE NEGOTIATING TABLE 

3511
08:52:52,807 --> 08:52:56,244
THIS TIME AROUND AND YET IT IS 

3512
08:52:56,244 --> 08:52:58,312
VERY MUCH A CONCERN FOR THOSE 

3513
08:52:58,312 --> 08:53:01,249
LOOKING AT NORTH KOREA.

3514
08:53:01,249 --> 08:53:02,950
>> JUJU CHANG, "NIGHTLINE" 

3515
08:53:02,950 --> 08:53:04,152
ANCHOR STANDING BY IN NEW YORK.

3517
08:53:05,319 --> 08:53:07,388
I WANT TO BRING IN JONATHAN KARL

3518
08:53:07,388 --> 08:53:08,522
BECAUSE JON IS IN THE ROOM 

3519
08:53:08,522 --> 08:53:09,524
AWAITING THE PRESIDENT.

3520
08:53:09,524 --> 08:53:11,692
HE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE 

3521
08:53:11,692 --> 08:53:12,960
INTERNATIONAL PRESS GATHERED IN 

3522
08:53:12,960 --> 08:53:14,695
THAT ROOM AND I KNOW THEY'RE 

3523
08:53:14,695 --> 08:53:15,896
PLAYING A VIDEO PRESENTATION.

3524
08:53:15,896 --> 08:53:17,865
DO A BIT OF A SCENE SETTING 

3525
08:53:17,865 --> 08:53:18,299
HERE.

3526
08:53:18,299 --> 08:53:23,371
WHAT IS IT THEY PRODUCED?

3527
08:53:23,371 --> 08:53:25,940
>> Reporter: THIS IS QUITE A 

3528
08:53:25,940 --> 08:53:27,374
PRODUCTION, VERY SLICKLY 

3529
08:53:27,374 --> 08:53:28,442
PRODUCED VIDEO AND PLAYED IT 

3530
08:53:28,442 --> 08:53:32,113
BOTH IN KOREAN AND IN -- NOW 

3531
08:53:32,113 --> 08:53:33,981
THEY'RE PLAYING IT IN ENGLISH.

3532
08:53:33,981 --> 08:53:36,217
IT'S A VIDEO THAT BASICALLY 

3533
08:53:36,217 --> 08:53:39,520
DESCRIBES THIS AS A MOMENT IN 

3534
08:53:39,520 --> 08:53:40,354
HISTORY WHERE WE HAVE AN 

3535
08:53:40,354 --> 08:53:41,689
OPPORTUNITY TO GO BETWEEN 

3536
08:53:41,689 --> 08:53:43,624
NUCLEAR WAR AND PROSPERITY FOR 

3537
08:53:43,624 --> 08:53:43,891
ALL.

3538
08:53:43,891 --> 08:53:49,831
IT'S REALLY QUITE A SLICK VIDEO 

3539
08:53:49,831 --> 08:53:50,164
PRESENTATION.

3540
08:53:50,164 --> 08:53:51,599
IT'S GOT OVERTONES OF PROPAGANDA

3541
08:53:51,599 --> 08:53:55,203
BUT A VERY SLICKLY PRODUCED 

3542
08:53:55,203 --> 08:53:55,503
PRODUCTION.

3543
08:53:55,503 --> 08:53:56,971
>> WILL THE WORLD EMBRACE THIS 

3544
08:53:56,971 --> 08:53:57,204
CHANGE?

3545
08:53:57,204 --> 08:54:00,007
>> I ALSO HAVE TO SAY IT 

3546
08:54:00,007 --> 08:54:00,741
ILLUSTRATES HOW MUCH PLANNING 

3547
08:54:00,741 --> 08:54:02,543
HAD ACTUALLY GONE INTO THIS 

3548
08:54:02,543 --> 08:54:02,776
SUMMIT.

3549
08:54:02,776 --> 08:54:04,178
I THINK THAT IN THE REPORTING 

3550
08:54:04,178 --> 08:54:05,446
LEADING UP TO THIS SUMMIT THERE 

3551
08:54:05,446 --> 08:54:06,480
WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT 

3552
08:54:06,480 --> 08:54:09,050
HOW PREPARED PRESIDENT TRUMP 

3553
08:54:09,050 --> 08:54:10,251
WAS, HOW MUCH STUDYING HE WAS 

3554
08:54:10,251 --> 08:54:10,451
DOING.

3555
08:54:10,451 --> 08:54:12,253
HE SAID I DON'T HAVE TO PREPARE 

3556
08:54:12,253 --> 08:54:13,887
MUCH BUT WAS A SHORT TIME THERE 

3557
08:54:13,887 --> 08:54:15,523
AFTER HE IS PREPARING AND 

3558
08:54:15,523 --> 08:54:16,757

08:54:16,757 --> 08:54:18,191
WITH SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, 

3560
08:54:18,191 --> 08:54:22,196
BUT TO SEE WITHIN MINUTES, 40 

3561
08:54:22,196 --> 08:54:25,233
MINUTES OR SO COMING OUT OF THAT

3562
08:54:25,233 --> 08:54:26,467
FACE-TO-FACE SAYING WE HAVE AN 

3563
08:54:26,467 --> 08:54:26,967
EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP.

3564
08:54:26,967 --> 08:54:28,603
WE GOT ALONG VERY GOOD IN THE 

3565
08:54:28,603 --> 08:54:30,104
PRESIDENT'S WORDS AND NOW TO SEE

3566
08:54:30,104 --> 08:54:31,439

08:54:36,878 --> 08:54:37,111
PLAYED.

3571
08:54:37,111 --> 08:54:39,280
I MEAN, THAT WOULD SHOW THAT 

3572
08:54:39,280 --> 08:54:40,114
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE PLANNING 

3573
08:54:40,114 --> 08:54:45,520
THAT WENT INTO THIS, JON.

3574
08:54:45,520 --> 08:54:46,420
>> Reporter: THERE WAS A LOT OF 

3575
08:54:46,420 --> 08:54:46,987
PLANNING IN THIS.

3576
08:54:46,987 --> 08:54:48,489
AND THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY.

3577
08:54:48,489 --> 08:54:50,624

[ APPLAUSE ]

3588
08:55:09,911 --> 08:55:12,480

08:55:14,181 --> 08:55:15,716
SINGAPORE TODAY.

3591
08:55:15,716 --> 08:55:17,017
HIS FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH 

3592
08:55:17,017 --> 08:55:18,286

BEING WATCHED ALL OVER THE 

3594
08:55:18,853 --> 08:55:19,120
WORLD.

3595
08:55:19,120 --> 08:55:24,425
WATCH THIS.

3596
08:55:24,425 --> 08:55:26,327
>> WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS 24 

3597
08:55:26,327 --> 08:55:27,494
HOURS AND THREE MONTHS BECAUSE 

3598
08:55:27,494 --> 08:55:29,596
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE

3599
08:55:29,596 --> 08:55:29,964
A WHILE.

3600
08:55:29,964 --> 08:55:31,632
THAT WAS A TAPE WE GAVE TO 

3601
08:55:31,632 --> 08:55:34,969
CHAIRMAN KIM AND HIS PEOPLE, HIS

3602
08:55:34,969 --> 08:55:35,770
REPRESENTATIVES AND IT CAPTURES 

3603
08:55:35,770 --> 08:55:38,272
A LOT, CAPTURES WHAT COULD BE 

3604
08:55:38,272 --> 08:55:41,675
DONE AND THAT'S A GREAT PLACE 

3605
08:55:41,675 --> 08:55:43,277
HAS A POTENTIAL TO BE AN 

3606
08:55:43,277 --> 08:55:44,378
INCREDIBLE PLACE BETWEEN SOUTH 

3607
08:55:44,378 --> 08:55:46,913
KOREA IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND 

3608
08:55:46,913 --> 08:55:47,415
CHINA.

3609
08:55:47,415 --> 08:55:48,616
THAT'S GOT TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL 

3610
08:55:48,616 --> 08:55:50,083
AND I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT 

3611
08:55:50,083 --> 08:55:53,054
AND HE WANTS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

3612
08:55:53,054 --> 08:55:55,422
IT'S MY HONOR TODAY TO ADDRESS

3621
08:56:15,610 --> 08:56:16,511
IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE.

3622
08:56:16,511 --> 08:56:17,778
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

3623
08:56:17,778 --> 08:56:19,780
I STAND BEFORE YOU AS AN 

3624
08:56:19,780 --> 08:56:20,848

WORLD.

GOOD MAN.

3649
08:57:14,769 --> 08:57:17,604
AND A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, 

3650
08:57:17,604 --> 08:57:22,443
PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA, WHO HAS 

3651
08:57:22,443 --> 08:57:24,645
REALLY CLOSED UP THAT BORDER, 

3652
08:57:24,645 --> 08:57:26,513
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS SO OVER 

3653
08:57:26,513 --> 08:57:28,048
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT 

3654
08:57:28,048 --> 08:57:30,050
THAT'S OKAY, BUT HE REALLY HAS, 

3655
08:57:30,050 --> 08:57:31,619

I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR 

3659
08:57:37,891 --> 08:57:40,594
EFFORTS TO HELP US GET TO THIS 

3660
08:57:40,594 --> 08:57:42,596
VERY HISTORIC DAY.

3661
08:57:42,596 --> 08:57:44,298
MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO THANK

3662
08:57:44,298 --> 08:57:47,568
CHAIRMAN KIM FOR TAKING THE 

3663
08:57:47,568 --> 08:57:49,069
FIRST BOLD STEP TOWARD A BRIGHT 

3664
08:57:49,069 --> 08:57:52,639
NEW FUTURE FOR HIS PEOPLE, OUR 

3665
08:57:52,639 --> 08:57:53,641
UNPRECEDENTED MEETING, THE FIRST

3666
08:57:53,641 --> 08:57:55,142
BETWEEN AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT 

3667
08:57:55,142 --> 08:57:59,646
AND A LEADER OF NORTH KOREA 

3668
08:57:59,646 --> 08:58:02,616
PROVES THAT REAL CHANGE IS 

3669
08:58:02,616 --> 08:58:03,417
INDEED POSSIBLE.

3670
08:58:03,417 --> 08:58:06,287
MY MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS

3671
08:58:06,287 --> 08:58:08,556
HONEST, DIRECT AND PRODUCTIVE.

3672
08:58:08,556 --> 08:58:10,424
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 

3673
08:58:10,424 --> 08:58:13,127
IN A VERY CONFINED PERIOD OF 

3674
08:58:13,127 --> 08:58:13,861
TIME.

3675
08:58:13,861 --> 08:58:15,463
UNDER VERY STRONG, STRONG 

3676
08:58:15,463 --> 08:58:17,498
CIRCUMSTANCE.

3677
08:58:17,498 --> 08:58:19,567
WE'RE PREPARED TO START A NEW 

3678
08:58:19,567 --> 08:58:21,001
HISTORY AND WE'RE READY TO WRITE

3679
08:58:21,001 --> 08:58:23,871
A NEW CHAPTER BETWEEN OUR 

3680
08:58:23,871 --> 08:58:25,239
NATIONS, NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO 

3681
08:58:25,239 --> 08:58:30,745
THINK OF THAT, 70 YEARS AGO AN 

3682
08:58:30,745 --> 08:58:32,279
EXTREMELY BLOODY CONFLICT 

3683
08:58:32,279 --> 08:58:34,882
RAVAGED THE KOREAN PENINSULA, 

3684
08:58:34,882 --> 08:58:37,151
COUNTLESS PEOPLE DIED IN THE 

3685
08:58:37,151 --> 08:58:38,452
CONFLICT INCLUDING TENS OF 

3686
08:58:38,452 --> 08:58:41,789
THOUSANDS OF BRAVE AMERICANS, 

3687
08:58:41,789 --> 08:58:43,056
YET, WHILE THE ARMISTICE WAS 

3688
08:58:43,056 --> 08:58:44,591
AGREED TO, THE WAR NEVER ENDED 

3689
08:58:44,591 --> 08:58:46,761
TO THIS DAY, NEVER ENDED.

3690
08:58:46,761 --> 08:58:48,629
BUT NOW WE CAN ALL HAVE HOPE 

3691
08:58:48,629 --> 08:58:50,264
THAT IT WILL SOON END AND IT 

3692
08:58:50,264 --> 08:58:50,998
WILL.

3693
08:58:50,998 --> 08:58:53,134
IT WILL SOON END.

3694
08:58:53,134 --> 08:58:55,403
THE PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO DEFINE

3695
08:58:55,403 --> 08:59:00,141
THE FUTURE.

3696
08:59:00,141 --> 08:59:00,441
Y

3697
08:59:00,441 --> 08:59:01,075
YESTERDAY'S CONFLICT DOES NOT 

3698
08:59:01,075 --> 08:59:03,010
HAVE TO BE TOMORROW'S WAR AND AS

3699
08:59:03,010 --> 08:59:05,346
HISTORY HAS PROVEN OVER AND OVER

3700
08:59:05,346 --> 08:59:07,648
AGAIN, ADVERSARIES CAN INDEED 

3701
08:59:07,648 --> 08:59:10,618
BECOME FRIENDS, WE CAN HONOR THE

3702
08:59:10,618 --> 08:59:13,153
SACRIFICE OF OUR FOREFATHERS BY 

3703
08:59:13,153 --> 08:59:14,421
REPLACING THE HORRORS OF BATTLE 

3704
08:59:14,421 --> 08:59:17,458
WITH THE BLESSINGS OF PEACE AND 

3705
08:59:17,458 --> 08:59:18,726
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AND 

3706
08:59:18,726 --> 08:59:20,795
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE.

3707
08:59:20,795 --> 08:59:22,263
THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT NORTH 

3708
08:59:22,263 --> 08:59:24,431
KOREA CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IT GIVES 

3709
08:59:24,431 --> 08:59:28,502
UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 

3710
08:59:28,502 --> 08:59:30,537
EMBRACES COMMERCE AND AN 

3711
08:59:30,537 --> 08:59:31,672
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE 

3712
08:59:31,672 --> 08:59:34,008
WORLD THAT REALLY WANTS TO 

3713
08:59:34,008 --> 08:59:34,675
ENGAGE.

3714
08:59:34,675 --> 08:59:38,412
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 

3715
08:59:38,412 --> 08:59:41,248
OPPORTUNITY LIKE NO OTHER TO BE 

3716
08:59:41,248 --> 08:59:42,816
REMEMBERED AS THE LEADER WHO 

3717
08:59:42,816 --> 08:59:45,986
USHERED IN A GLORIOUS NEW ERA OF

3718
08:59:45,986 --> 08:59:49,990
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY FOR HIS 

3719
08:59:49,990 --> 08:59:51,225
PEOPLE, CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST 

3720
08:59:51,225 --> 08:59:52,526
SIGNED A JOINT STATEMENT IN 

3721
08:59:52,526 --> 08:59:54,561
WHICH HE REAFFIRMED HIS 

3722
08:59:54,561 --> 08:59:57,431
UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO 

3723
08:59:57,431 --> 09:00:00,501
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

3724
09:00:00,501 --> 09:00:02,102
KOREAN PENINSULA.

3725
09:00:02,102 --> 09:00:04,939
WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS 

3726
09:00:04,939 --> 09:00:06,740
NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE 

3727
09:00:06,740 --> 09:00:09,243
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 

3728
09:00:09,243 --> 09:00:10,877
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT.

3729
09:00:10,877 --> 09:00:13,581
THIS ISN'T THE PAST.

3730
09:00:13,581 --> 09:00:15,082
THIS ISN'T ANOTHER 

3731
09:00:15,082 --> 09:00:18,152
ADMINISTRATION THAT NEVER GOT IT

3732
09:00:18,152 --> 09:00:20,221
STARTED AND, THEREFORE, NEVER 

3733
09:00:20,221 --> 09:00:21,355
GOT IT DONE.

3734
09:00:21,355 --> 09:00:23,056
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TOLD ME THAT 

3735
09:00:23,056 --> 09:00:26,460
NORTH KOREA'S ALREADY DESTROYING

3736
09:00:26,460 --> 09:00:30,364
A MAJOR MISSILE ENGINE TESTING 

3737
09:00:30,364 --> 09:00:30,564
SITE.

3738
09:00:30,564 --> 09:00:32,199
THAT'S NOT IN YOUR SIGNED 

3739
09:00:32,199 --> 09:00:32,566
DOCUMENT.

3740
09:00:32,566 --> 09:00:35,102
WE AGREED TO THAT AFTER THE 

3741
09:00:35,102 --> 09:00:37,338
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED.

3742
09:00:37,338 --> 09:00:38,539
THAT'S A BIG THING.

3743
09:00:38,539 --> 09:00:40,140
FOR THE MISSILES THAT THEY WERE 

3744
09:00:40,140 --> 09:00:40,907
TESTING, THE SITE IS GOING TO BE

3745
09:00:40,907 --> 09:00:43,477
DESTROYED VERY SOON.

3746
09:00:43,477 --> 09:00:45,446
TODAY IS THE BEGINNING OF AN 

3747
09:00:45,446 --> 09:00:47,581
ARDUOUS PROCESS, OUR EYES ARE 

3748
09:00:47,581 --> 09:00:49,750
WIDE OPEN BUT PEACE IS ALWAYS 

3749
09:00:49,750 --> 09:00:50,985
WORTH THE EFFORT.

3750
09:00:50,985 --> 09:00:53,254
ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE.

3751
09:00:53,254 --> 09:00:54,722
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS

3752
09:00:54,722 --> 09:00:54,989
AGO.

3753
09:00:54,989 --> 09:00:56,290
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A

3754
09:00:56,290 --> 09:00:59,460
LONG TIME AGO.

3755
09:00:59,460 --> 09:01:02,129
BUT WE'RE RESOLVING IT NOW.

3756
09:01:02,129 --> 09:01:04,197
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS THE CHANCE TO 

3757
09:01:04,197 --> 09:01:06,734
SEIZE AN INCREDIBLE FUTURE FOR 

3758
09:01:06,734 --> 09:01:07,535
HIS PEOPLE.

3759
09:01:07,535 --> 09:01:10,404
ANYONE CAN MAKE WAR, BUT ONLY 

3760
09:01:10,404 --> 09:01:13,641
THE MOST COURAGEOUS CAN MAKE 

3761
09:01:13,641 --> 09:01:13,841
PEACE.

3762
09:01:13,841 --> 09:01:15,409
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 

3763
09:01:15,409 --> 09:01:16,843
CANNOT ENDURE FOREVER.

3764
09:01:16,843 --> 09:01:19,780
THE PEOPLE OF KOREA, NORTH AND 

3765
09:01:19,780 --> 09:01:23,083
SOUTH, ARE PROFOUNDLY TALENTED, 

3766
09:01:23,083 --> 09:01:24,051
INDUSTRIOUS AND GIFTED.

3767
09:01:24,051 --> 09:01:25,719
THESE ARE TRULY GIFTED PEOPLE.

3768
09:01:25,719 --> 09:01:27,922
THEY SHARE THE SAME HERITAGE, 

3769
09:01:27,922 --> 09:01:30,391
LANGUAGE, CUSTOMS, CULTURE AND 

3770
09:01:30,391 --> 09:01:30,624
DESTINY.

3771
09:01:30,624 --> 09:01:33,427
BUT TO REALIZE THEIR AMAZING 

3772
09:01:33,427 --> 09:01:35,329
DESTINY, TO REUNITE THEIR 

3773
09:01:35,329 --> 09:01:37,965
NATIONAL FAMILY, THE MENACE OF 

3774
09:01:37,965 --> 09:01:40,601
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL NOW BE 

3775
09:01:40,601 --> 09:01:41,035
REMOVED.

3776
09:01:41,035 --> 09:01:44,037
IN THE MEANTIME, THE SANCTIONS 

3777
09:01:44,037 --> 09:01:47,007
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT.

3778
09:01:47,007 --> 09:01:48,742
WE DREAM OF A FUTURE WHERE ALL 

3779
09:01:48,742 --> 09:01:51,445
KOREANS CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN 

3780
09:01:51,445 --> 09:01:53,313
HARMONY, WHERE FAMILIES ARE 

3781
09:01:53,313 --> 09:01:54,748
REUNITED AND HOPES ARE REBORN 

3782
09:01:54,748 --> 09:01:56,283
AND WHERE THE LIGHT OF PEACE 

3783
09:01:56,283 --> 09:01:59,820
CHASES AWAY THE DARKNESS OF WAR.

3784
09:01:59,820 --> 09:02:02,089
THIS BRIGHT FUTURE IS WITHIN AND

3785
09:02:02,089 --> 09:02:03,657
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

3786
09:02:03,657 --> 09:02:05,359
IT IS RIGHT THERE.

3787
09:02:05,359 --> 09:02:07,394
IT'S WITHIN OUR REACH.

3788
09:02:07,394 --> 09:02:08,495
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE.

3789
09:02:08,495 --> 09:02:11,298
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

3790
09:02:11,298 --> 09:02:12,499
PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS COULD NEVER 

3791
09:02:12,499 --> 09:02:13,300
TAKE PLACE.

3792
09:02:13,300 --> 09:02:15,970
IT IS NOW TAKING PLACE.

3793
09:02:15,970 --> 09:02:17,338
IT'S A VERY GREAT DAY.

3794
09:02:17,338 --> 09:02:18,939
IT'S A VERY GREAT MOMENT IN THE 

3795
09:02:18,939 --> 09:02:23,644
HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND 

3796
09:02:23,644 --> 09:02:25,145
CHAIRMAN KIM IS ON HIS WAY BACK 

3797
09:02:25,145 --> 09:02:27,347
TO NORTH KOREA AND I KNOW FOR A 

3798
09:02:27,347 --> 09:02:28,882
FACT AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES HE 

3799
09:02:28,882 --> 09:02:30,050
WILL START A PROCESS THAT'S 

3800
09:02:30,050 --> 09:02:31,518
GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE 

3801
09:02:31,518 --> 09:02:33,721
VERY HAPPY AND VERY SAFE.

3802
09:02:33,721 --> 09:02:35,723
SO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH 

3803
09:02:35,723 --> 09:02:36,490
EVERYBODY TODAY.

3804
09:02:36,490 --> 09:02:38,091
THE MEDIA, IT'S A BIG GATHERING 

3805
09:02:38,091 --> 09:02:40,628
OF MEDIA, I WILL SAY.

3806
09:02:40,628 --> 09:02:41,729
MAKES ME FEEL VERY 

3807
09:02:41,729 --> 09:02:44,264
UNCOMFORTABLE.

3808
09:02:44,264 --> 09:02:44,564
[ LAUGHTER ]

3809
09:02:44,564 --> 09:02:45,432
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

3810
09:02:45,432 --> 09:02:47,468
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS 

3811
09:02:47,468 --> 09:02:48,735
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL 

3812
09:02:48,735 --> 09:02:51,038

YOUR FAMILIES SO THANK YOU VERY

09:02:51,905 --> 09:02:52,506
MUCH FOR BEING HERE.

3815
09:02:52,506 --> 09:02:53,273
WE'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.

3816
09:02:53,273 --> 09:02:56,076
WOW.

3817
09:02:56,076 --> 09:02:56,643
THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

3818
09:02:56,643 --> 09:02:59,580
GO AHEAD, SURE.

3819
09:02:59,580 --> 09:03:00,381
>> THANK YOU.

3820
09:03:00,381 --> 09:03:01,015
>> NBC.

3821
09:03:01,015 --> 09:03:01,714
>> THANKS, MR. PRESIDENT.

3822
09:03:01,714 --> 09:03:03,117
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU IF YOU 

3823
09:03:03,117 --> 09:03:04,751
DON'T MIND, FIRST, THE MAN YOU 

3824
09:03:04,751 --> 09:03:07,087
MET TODAY, KIM JONG-UN, AS YOU 

3825
09:03:07,087 --> 09:03:08,755
KNOW HAS KILLED FAMILY MEMBERS, 

3826
09:03:08,755 --> 09:03:10,991
HAS STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, IS 

3827
09:03:10,991 --> 09:03:13,259
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF 

3828
09:03:13,259 --> 09:03:15,429
OTTO WARMBIER, WHY ARE YOU SO 

3829
09:03:15,429 --> 09:03:17,464
COMFORTABLE CALLING HIM VERY 

3830
09:03:17,464 --> 09:03:17,831
TALENTED?

3831
09:03:17,831 --> 09:03:19,533
>> WELL, HE IS VERY TALENTED.

3832
09:03:19,533 --> 09:03:21,568
ANYBODY THAT TAKES OVER A 

3833
09:03:21,568 --> 09:03:23,870
SITUATION LIKE HE DID AT 26 

3834
09:03:23,870 --> 09:03:27,374
YEARS OF AGE AND IS ABLE TO RUN 

3835
09:03:27,374 --> 09:03:31,145
IT AND RUN IT TOUGH, I DON'T SAY

3836
09:03:31,145 --> 09:03:31,945
HE WAS NICE OR I DON'T SAY 

3837
09:03:31,945 --> 09:03:34,247
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, HE RUN IT -- 

3838
09:03:34,247 --> 09:03:35,449
VERY FEW PEOPLE AT THAT AGE YOU 

3839
09:03:35,449 --> 09:03:39,453
CAN TAKE ONE OUT OF 10,000 

3840
09:03:39,453 --> 09:03:41,321
PROBABLY COULDN'T DO IT.

3841
09:03:41,321 --> 09:03:42,823
OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL 

3842
09:03:42,823 --> 09:03:44,491
PERSON AND HE WILL BE FOR A LONG

3843
09:03:44,491 --> 09:03:45,225
TIME IN MY LIFE.

3844
09:03:45,225 --> 09:03:47,795
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 

3845
09:03:47,795 --> 09:03:47,995
MINE.

3846
09:03:47,995 --> 09:03:49,863
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO, THIS WOULD

3847
09:03:49,863 --> 09:03:52,232
NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

3848
09:03:52,232 --> 09:03:54,668
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 

3849
09:03:54,668 --> 09:03:56,503
DAY, IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING.

3850
09:03:56,503 --> 09:03:57,705
IT WAS BRUTAL.

3851
09:03:57,705 --> 09:03:59,740
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTED TO 

3852
09:03:59,740 --> 09:04:03,510
FOCUS ON WHAT WAS GOING ON 

3853
09:04:03,510 --> 09:04:05,145
INCLUDING NORTH KOREA.

3854
09:04:05,145 --> 09:04:07,848
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 

3855
09:04:07,848 --> 09:04:10,117
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.

3856
09:04:10,117 --> 09:04:12,519
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS.

3857
09:04:12,519 --> 09:04:14,087
A SPECIAL YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE 

3858
09:04:14,087 --> 09:04:17,524
TO SAY SPECIAL PARENTS, SPECIAL 

3859
09:04:17,524 --> 09:04:17,925
PEOPLE.

3860
09:04:17,925 --> 09:04:19,293
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.

3861
09:04:19,293 --> 09:04:21,361
HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH US BEING

3862
09:04:21,361 --> 09:04:22,062
HERE TODAY, OKAY.

3863
09:04:22,062 --> 09:04:22,495
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3864
09:04:22,495 --> 09:04:23,731
>> THAT SECOND QUESTION FOR YOU,

3865
09:04:23,731 --> 09:04:25,499
SIR, WAS ON THE SECURITY.

3866
09:04:25,499 --> 09:04:26,933
SECOND QUESTION, SIR, ON THE 

3867
09:04:26,933 --> 09:04:28,135
SECURITY ASSURANCES YOU TALKED 

3868
09:04:28,135 --> 09:04:28,936
ABOUT IN YOUR STATEMENT.

3869
09:04:28,936 --> 09:04:30,871
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 

3870
09:04:30,871 --> 09:04:32,506
ASSURANCES YOU ARE WILLING TO 

3871
09:04:32,506 --> 09:04:33,607
GIVE TO KIM JONG-UN?

3872
09:04:33,607 --> 09:04:35,275
DOES THAT INCLUDE REDUCING 

3873
09:04:35,275 --> 09:04:36,176
MILITARY CAPABILITIES AND JUST 

3874
09:04:36,176 --> 09:04:37,043
TO FOLLOW UP -- 

3875
09:04:37,043 --> 09:04:38,545
>> WE'RE NOT REDUCING ANYTHING.

3876
09:04:38,545 --> 09:04:40,514
WE'RE NOT REDUCING, AT SOME 

3877
09:04:40,514 --> 09:04:41,782
POINT I HAVE TO BE HONEST AND 

3878
09:04:41,782 --> 09:04:42,682
USED TO SAY THIS DURING MY 

3879
09:04:42,682 --> 09:04:43,950
CAMPAIGN AS YOU KNOW PROBABLY 

3880
09:04:43,950 --> 09:04:46,653
BETTER THAN MOST, I WANT TO GET 

3881
09:04:46,653 --> 09:04:48,489
OUR SOLDIERS OUT.

3882
09:04:48,489 --> 09:04:49,790
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 

3883
09:04:49,790 --> 09:04:51,425
BACK HOME.

3884
09:04:51,425 --> 09:04:54,294
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS IN SOUTH

3885
09:04:54,294 --> 09:04:56,096
KOREA AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

3886
09:04:56,096 --> 09:04:57,331
BRING THEM BACK HOME BUT THAT'S 

3887
09:04:57,331 --> 09:04:59,466
NOT PART OF THE EQUATION RIGHT 

3888
09:04:59,466 --> 09:04:59,632
NOW.

3889
09:04:59,632 --> 09:05:01,267
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL BE 

3890
09:05:01,267 --> 09:05:02,102
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.

3891
09:05:02,102 --> 09:05:03,904
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 

3892
09:05:03,904 --> 09:05:05,271
GAMES, WHICH WILL SAVE US A 

3893
09:05:05,271 --> 09:05:07,440
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY 

3894
09:05:07,440 --> 09:05:11,211
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 

3895
09:05:11,211 --> 09:05:13,780
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 

3896
09:05:13,780 --> 09:05:16,015
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD BUT WE'LL 

3897
09:05:16,015 --> 09:05:17,751
BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

3898
09:05:17,751 --> 09:05:20,921
MONEY, PLUS, I THINK IT'S VERY 

3899
09:05:20,921 --> 09:05:21,221
PROVOCATIVE.

3900
09:05:21,221 --> 09:05:27,127
YES.

3901
09:05:27,127 --> 09:05:27,694
GO AHEAD.

3902
09:05:27,694 --> 09:05:28,027
OH, GO AHEAD.

3903
09:05:28,027 --> 09:05:30,063
I'M SORRY.

3904
09:05:30,063 --> 09:05:31,464
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOHN ROBERTS.

3905
09:05:31,464 --> 09:05:33,467
YOU LOOKED -- MUCH BETTER, 

3906
09:05:33,467 --> 09:05:33,700
RIGHT. 

3907
09:05:33,700 --> 09:05:34,301
>> WE'RE FREQUENTLY CONFUSED, 

3908
09:05:34,301 --> 09:05:35,002
MR. PRESIDENT.

3909
09:05:35,002 --> 09:05:37,204
>> YES.

3910
09:05:37,204 --> 09:05:39,072
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THIS JOINT 

3911
09:05:39,072 --> 09:05:41,074
STATEMENT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT 

3912
09:05:41,074 --> 09:05:42,943
VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE 

3913
09:05:42,943 --> 09:05:43,343
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

3914
09:05:43,343 --> 09:05:43,610
>> YEAH. 

3915
09:05:43,610 --> 09:05:46,046
>> IS THAT A CONCESSION ON THE 

3916
09:05:46,046 --> 09:05:46,613
PART OF THE UNITED STATES. 

3917
09:05:46,613 --> 09:05:47,147
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

3918
09:05:47,147 --> 09:05:48,781
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT SAID WE 

3919
09:05:48,781 --> 09:05:53,420
ARE GOING TO -- LET'S SEE HERE.

3920
09:05:53,420 --> 09:05:54,387
IT WILL BE GONE, I DON'T THINK 

3921
09:05:54,387 --> 09:05:56,056
YOU CAN BE ANY MORE PLAIN THAN 

3922
09:05:56,056 --> 09:05:58,625
WHAT WE'RE ASKING.

3923
09:05:58,625 --> 09:05:59,693
ISSUES RELATED TO THE 

3924
09:05:59,693 --> 09:06:02,196
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW U.S. 

3925
09:06:02,196 --> 09:06:03,831
DPKR RELATIONS, THE BUILDING.

3926
09:06:03,831 --> 09:06:06,733
WE TALK ABOUT THE GUARANTEES AND

3927
09:06:06,733 --> 09:06:09,235
WE TALK ABOUT UNWAVERING 

3928
09:06:09,235 --> 09:06:12,839
COMMITMENT TO THE COMPLETE 

3929
09:06:12,839 --> 09:06:14,508
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 

3930
09:06:14,508 --> 09:06:14,775
PENINSULA.

3931
09:06:14,775 --> 09:06:16,009
THIS IS THE DOCUMENT THAT WE 

3932
09:06:16,009 --> 09:06:16,576
JUST SIGNED.

3933
09:06:16,576 --> 09:06:18,377
>> DID YOU DISCUSS WITH CHAIRMAN

3934
09:06:18,377 --> 09:06:19,779
KIM METHODS TO VERIFY EITHER 

3935
09:06:19,779 --> 09:06:22,548
WITH YOU THE UNITED STATES OR 

3936
09:06:22,548 --> 09:06:23,750
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT

3937
09:06:23,750 --> 09:06:24,184
VERY PROCESS?

3938
09:06:24,184 --> 09:06:25,085
>> YES, WE DID. 

3939
09:06:25,085 --> 09:06:27,154
>> AND DO YOU HAVE A TIMETABLE.

3940
09:06:27,154 --> 09:06:29,822
COULD YOU GIVE US THAT?

3941
09:06:29,822 --> 09:06:31,023
HOW WILL IT BE ACHIEVED. 

3942
09:06:31,023 --> 09:06:32,226
>> IT WILL BE ACHIEVED BY HAVING

3943
09:06:32,226 --> 09:06:34,561
A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE AND AS WE 

3944
09:06:34,561 --> 09:06:36,595
DEVELOP A CERTAIN TRUST AND WE 

3945
09:06:36,595 --> 09:06:38,932
THINK WE HAVE DONE THAT, 

3946
09:06:38,932 --> 09:06:40,400
SECRETARY POMPEO'S BEEN REALLY 

3947
09:06:40,400 --> 09:06:41,934
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB.

3948
09:06:41,934 --> 09:06:44,203
HIS STAFF, EVERYBODY, AS WE DO 

3949
09:06:44,203 --> 09:06:45,305
THAT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT 

3950
09:06:45,305 --> 09:06:46,339
OF PEOPLE THERE AND WE'RE GOING 

3951
09:06:46,339 --> 09:06:47,708
TO BE WORKING WITH THEM ON A LOT

3952
09:06:47,708 --> 09:06:51,177
OF OTHER THINGS, BUT THIS IS 

3953
09:06:51,177 --> 09:06:53,614
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 

3954
09:06:53,614 --> 09:06:54,214
NORTH KOREA.

3955
09:06:54,214 --> 09:06:55,180
AND IT WILL BE VERIFIED.

3956
09:06:55,180 --> 09:06:56,383
>> WILL THOSE PEOPLE BE 

3957
09:06:56,383 --> 09:06:57,451
AMERICANS OR INTERNATIONAL -- 

3958
09:06:57,451 --> 09:06:59,853
>> A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE.

3959
09:06:59,853 --> 09:07:00,653
A COMBINATION OF ABOVE AND WE 

3960
09:07:00,653 --> 09:07:02,723
HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT, YES.

3961
09:07:02,723 --> 09:07:03,523
GO AHEAD.

3962
09:07:03,523 --> 09:07:06,426
BE NICE.

3963
09:07:06,426 --> 09:07:07,027
BE RESPECTFUL.

3964
09:07:07,027 --> 09:07:09,595
>> I'LL BE VERY RESPECTFUL, SIR.

3965
09:07:09,595 --> 09:07:11,798
WHAT DID KIM JONG-UN SAY TO YOU 

3966
09:07:11,798 --> 09:07:15,402
TO GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT 

3967
09:07:15,402 --> 09:07:16,837
FOR ONCE IN THE HISTORY OF NORTH

3968
09:07:16,837 --> 09:07:18,771
KOREA THEY ARE NOT CHEATING THE 

3969
09:07:18,771 --> 09:07:21,942
SYSTEM AND GAMING THE WORLD AND 

3970
09:07:21,942 --> 09:07:22,809
GAMING THE PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE 

3971
09:07:22,809 --> 09:07:24,843
TO GO IN AND MAKE SURE THAT 

3972
09:07:24,843 --> 09:07:26,680
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GIVING UP THEIR

3973
09:07:26,680 --> 09:07:27,514
NUCLEAR ARSENAL?

3974
09:07:27,514 --> 09:07:28,482
>> VERY FAIR QUESTION.

3975
09:07:28,482 --> 09:07:30,750
HE ACTUALLY MENTIONED THE FACT 

3976
09:07:30,750 --> 09:07:32,017
THAT THEY PROCEEDED DOWN A PATH 

3977
09:07:32,017 --> 09:07:34,254
IN THE PAST AND ULTIMATELY AS 

3978
09:07:34,254 --> 09:07:35,788
YOU KNOW NOTHING GOT DONE AND 

3979
09:07:35,788 --> 09:07:38,926
ONE CASE THEY TOOK BILLIONS OF 

3980
09:07:38,926 --> 09:07:42,496
DOLLARS DURING THE CLINTON 

3981
09:07:42,496 --> 09:07:43,730
REGIME, TOOK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

3982
09:07:43,730 --> 09:07:44,362
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.

3983
09:07:44,362 --> 09:07:46,533
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING AND HE

3984
09:07:46,533 --> 09:07:48,902
ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP TO ME AND

3985
09:07:48,902 --> 09:07:51,504
HE SAID, WE HAVE NEVER GONE THIS

3986
09:07:51,504 --> 09:07:51,771
FAR.

3987
09:07:51,771 --> 09:07:52,906
I DON'T THINK THEY'VE EVER HAD 

3988
09:07:52,906 --> 09:07:54,574
THE CONFIDENCE, FRANKLY, IN A 

3989
09:07:54,574 --> 09:07:55,442
PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT 

3990
09:07:55,442 --> 09:07:56,977
NOW FOR GETTING THINGS DONE AND 

3991
09:07:56,977 --> 09:08:00,013
HAVING THE ABILITY TO GET THINGS

3992
09:08:00,013 --> 09:08:00,514
DONE.

3993
09:08:00,514 --> 09:08:03,449
AND HE WAS VERY FIRM IN THE FACT

3994
09:08:03,449 --> 09:08:04,517
THAT HE WANTS TO DO THIS -- I 

3995
09:08:04,517 --> 09:08:06,019
THINK HE MIGHT WANT TO DO THIS 

3996
09:08:06,019 --> 09:08:08,455
AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN ME 

3997
09:08:08,455 --> 09:08:09,989
BECAUSE THEY SEE A VERY BRIGHT 

3998
09:08:09,989 --> 09:08:12,192
FUTURE FOR NORTH KOREA.

3999
09:08:12,192 --> 09:08:14,360
SO, YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT?

4000
09:08:14,360 --> 09:08:15,495
WE NEVER KNOW BUT I'LL TELL YOU 

4001
09:08:15,495 --> 09:08:17,663
WHAT WE SIGNED A VERY 

4002
09:08:17,663 --> 09:08:19,032
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT TODAY AND

4003
09:08:19,032 --> 09:08:20,432
I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE BEEN 

4004
09:08:20,432 --> 09:08:21,767
GIVEN THAT DOCUMENT.

4005
09:08:21,767 --> 09:08:24,504
BUT WE SIGNED A VERY, VERY 

4006
09:08:24,504 --> 09:08:25,671
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT AND I 

4007
09:08:25,671 --> 09:08:27,040
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO LIVE UP TO

4008
09:08:27,040 --> 09:08:27,773
THAT DOCUMENT.

4009
09:08:27,773 --> 09:08:29,341
IN FACT, WHEN HE LANDS WHICH IS 

4010
09:08:29,341 --> 09:08:30,910
GOING TO BE SHORTLY, I THINK 

4011
09:08:30,910 --> 09:08:31,911
THAT HE WILL START THAT PROCESS 

4012
09:08:31,911 --> 09:08:33,747
RIGHT AWAY.

4013
09:08:33,747 --> 09:08:34,281
I DO.

4014
09:08:34,281 --> 09:08:34,614
I DO.

4015
09:08:34,614 --> 09:08:38,150
I CAN ONLY SAY I KNOW I'M FOR 

4016
09:08:38,150 --> 09:08:40,453
REALLY WELL -- IT'S BEEN VERY 

4017
09:08:40,453 --> 09:08:41,220
RHETORICAL AS YOU KNOW.

4018
09:08:41,220 --> 09:08:43,089
I THINK WITHOUT THE RHETORIC IT 

4019
09:08:43,089 --> 09:08:45,191
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED, I THINK 

4020
09:08:45,191 --> 09:08:47,761
WITHOUT OTHER THINGS GOING 

4021
09:08:47,761 --> 09:08:49,529
ALONG, I THINK THE ESTABLISHMENT

4022
09:08:49,529 --> 09:08:53,033
OF A NEW TEAM WAS VERY 

4023
09:08:53,033 --> 09:08:53,333
IMPORTANT.

4024
09:08:53,333 --> 09:08:54,634
THEY HAVE A GREAT TEAM BUT I DO.

4025
09:08:54,634 --> 09:08:56,502
I THINK HE WANTS TO GET IT DONE.

4026
09:08:56,502 --> 09:08:57,571
I REALLY FEEL THAT VERY 

4027
09:08:57,571 --> 09:09:00,040
STRONGLY.

4028
09:09:00,040 --> 09:09:00,374
JOHN.

4029
09:09:00,374 --> 09:09:02,074
YOU TWO GUYS LOOK ALIKE WHEN THE

4030
09:09:02,074 --> 09:09:02,775
LIGHT IS RIGHT.

4031
09:09:02,775 --> 09:09:04,945
THE HAIR IS VERY SIMILAR.

4032
09:09:04,945 --> 09:09:06,980
WHO HAS BETTER HAIR?

4033
09:09:06,980 --> 09:09:07,514
PRETTY GOOD HAIR. 

4034
09:09:07,514 --> 09:09:10,250
>> IT'S THE ANGELIC GLOW OF THE 

4035
09:09:10,250 --> 09:09:10,850
BACKLIGHTING, MR. PRESIDENT, 

4036
09:09:10,850 --> 09:09:13,854
THAT MAKES US LOOK SO SIMILAR.

4037
09:09:13,854 --> 09:09:16,890
OF COURSE, THE DENUCLEARIZATION 

4038
09:09:16,890 --> 09:09:18,625
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND BIOLOGICAL 

4039
09:09:18,625 --> 09:09:19,960
WEAPONS IS ONE PROBLEM IN NORTH 

4040
09:09:19,960 --> 09:09:20,292
KOREA.

4041
09:09:20,292 --> 09:09:22,896
ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM IS THE 

4042
09:09:22,896 --> 09:09:23,830
HORRIBLE RECORD THAT THEY HAVE 

4043
09:09:23,830 --> 09:09:25,999
ON HUMAN RIGHTS.

4044
09:09:25,999 --> 09:09:27,500
WAS THAT DISCUSSED AT ALL?

4045
09:09:27,500 --> 09:09:28,368
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL 

4046
09:09:28,368 --> 09:09:29,434
TACKLE IN THE FUTURE. 

4047
09:09:29,434 --> 09:09:31,838
>> YES, IT WAS DISCUSSED.

4048
09:09:31,838 --> 09:09:33,506
IT WILL BE DISCUSSED MORE IN THE

4049
09:09:33,506 --> 09:09:35,509
FUTURE, HUMAN RIGHTS.

4050
09:09:35,509 --> 09:09:38,110
WHAT WAS ALSO DISCUSSED IN GREAT

4051
09:09:38,110 --> 09:09:39,612
DETAIL, JOHN, WAS THE FACT THAT,

4052
09:09:39,612 --> 09:09:42,415
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE -- AND I MUST 

4053
09:09:42,415 --> 09:09:44,483
HAVE HAD -- JUST COUNTLESS CALLS

4054
09:09:44,483 --> 09:09:47,720
AND LETTERS AND WEEKS, ANYTHING 

4055
09:09:47,720 --> 09:09:48,855
CAN YOU DO, THEY WANT THE 

4056
09:09:48,855 --> 09:09:50,657
REMAINS OF THEIR SONS BACK.

4057
09:09:50,657 --> 09:09:52,025
THEY WANT THE REMAINS OF THEIR 

4058
09:09:52,025 --> 09:09:54,860
FATHERS AND MOTHERS, ALL OF THE 

4059
09:09:54,860 --> 09:09:56,629
PEOPLE THAT GOT CAUGHT INTO THAT

4060
09:09:56,629 --> 09:09:59,732
REALLY BRUTAL WAR, WHICH TOOK 

4061
09:09:59,732 --> 09:10:03,470
PLACE TO A LARGE EXTENT IN NORTH

4062
09:10:03,470 --> 09:10:05,672
KOREA AND I ASKED FOR IT TODAY 

4063
09:10:05,672 --> 09:10:08,508
AND WE GOT IT.

4064
09:10:08,508 --> 09:10:09,943
THAT WAS A VERY LAST MINUTE, THE

4065
09:10:09,943 --> 09:10:10,843
REMAINS WILL BE COMING BACK.

4066
09:10:10,843 --> 09:10:12,479
THEY'RE GOING TO START THAT 

4067
09:10:12,479 --> 09:10:13,280
PROCESS IMMEDIATELY.

4068
09:10:13,280 --> 09:10:14,781
BUT SO MANY PEOPLE, EVEN DURING 

4069
09:10:14,781 --> 09:10:16,015
THE CAMPAIGN THEY'LL SAY, IS 

4070
09:10:16,015 --> 09:10:18,818
THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN WORK WITH 

4071
09:10:18,818 --> 09:10:20,186
NORTH KOREA TO GET THE REMAINS 

4072
09:10:20,186 --> 09:10:24,491
OF MY SON BACK OR MY FATHER 

4073
09:10:24,491 --> 09:10:24,691
BACK?

4074
09:10:24,691 --> 09:10:26,693
SO MANY PEOPLE ASKED ME THIS 

4075
09:10:26,693 --> 09:10:27,927
QUESTION AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID, 

4076
09:10:27,927 --> 09:10:29,696
LOOK, WE DON'T GET ALONG TOO 

4077
09:10:29,696 --> 09:10:31,131
WELL WITH THAT PARTICULAR GROUP 

4078
09:10:31,131 --> 09:10:32,265
OF PEOPLE.

4079
09:10:32,265 --> 09:10:33,500
BUT NOW WE DO.

4080
09:10:33,500 --> 09:10:35,135
AND HE AGREED TO THAT SO QUICKLY

4081
09:10:35,135 --> 09:10:36,669
AND SO NICE -- IT WAS REALLY A 

4082
09:10:36,669 --> 09:10:38,071
VERY NICE THING AND HE 

4083
09:10:38,071 --> 09:10:38,705
UNDERSTANDS IT.

4084
09:10:38,705 --> 09:10:41,374
HE UNDERSTANDS IT.

4085
09:10:41,374 --> 09:10:43,243
SO FOR THE THOUSANDS AND 

4086
09:10:43,243 --> 09:10:44,911
THOUSANDS, I GUESS, WAY OVER 

4087
09:10:44,911 --> 09:10:46,411
6,000 THAT WE KNOW OF IN TERMS 

4088
09:10:46,411 --> 09:10:51,150
OF THE REMAINS, THEY'LL BE 

4089
09:10:51,150 --> 09:10:51,650
BROUGHT BACK.

4090
09:10:51,650 --> 09:10:55,722
>> THE P.O.W./M.I.A. ISSUE -- 

4091
09:10:55,722 --> 09:10:56,822
>> ESPECIALLY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE

4092
09:10:56,822 --> 09:10:57,858
THAT ARE -- 

4093
09:10:57,858 --> 09:11:00,260
>> WHAT DO YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP,

4094
09:11:00,260 --> 09:11:02,127
EXPECT KIM JONG-UN TO DO ABOUT 

4095
09:11:02,127 --> 09:11:04,498
THE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 

4096
09:11:04,498 --> 09:11:06,032
REGARDING THE NORTH KOREAN 

4097
09:11:06,032 --> 09:11:06,265
PEOPLE. 

4098
09:11:06,265 --> 09:11:08,068
>> RIGHT, IT WAS DISCUSSED.

4099
09:11:08,068 --> 09:11:09,302
IT WAS DISCUSSED RELATIVELY 

4100
09:11:09,302 --> 09:11:12,538
BRIEFLY COMPARED TO 

4101
09:11:12,538 --> 09:11:13,406
DENUCLEARIZATION, OBVIOUSLY 

4102
09:11:13,406 --> 09:11:14,239
THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED AND 

4103
09:11:14,239 --> 09:11:15,675
WHERE WE ENDED.

4104
09:11:15,675 --> 09:11:17,744
BUT THEY WILL BE DOING THINGS 

4105
09:11:17,744 --> 09:11:19,779
AND I THINK HE WANTS TO DO 

4106
09:11:19,779 --> 09:11:20,012
THINGS.

4107
09:11:20,012 --> 09:11:20,947
I THINK HE WANTS TO.

4108
09:11:20,947 --> 09:11:22,582
YOU'D BE VERY SURPRISED, VERY 

4109
09:11:22,582 --> 09:11:26,086
SMART, VERY GOOD NEGOTIATOR, 

4110
09:11:26,086 --> 09:11:27,286
WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

4111
09:11:27,286 --> 09:11:29,856
HE BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT IN 

4112
09:11:29,856 --> 09:11:32,992
THE PAST THEY TOOK DIALOGUE -- 

4113
09:11:32,992 --> 09:11:35,161
THEY NEVER WERE LIKE WE ARE, 

4114
09:11:35,161 --> 09:11:36,428
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE

4115
09:11:36,428 --> 09:11:37,998
WHAT'S TAKEN PLACE NOW, BUT THEY

4116
09:11:37,998 --> 09:11:40,367
WENT DOWN THE LINE, BILLIONS OF 

4117
09:11:40,367 --> 09:11:42,102
DOLLARS WERE GIVEN AND, YOU 

4118
09:11:42,102 --> 09:11:44,504
KNOW, THE FOLLOWING DAY THE 

4119
09:11:44,504 --> 09:11:46,605
NUCLEAR PROGRAM CONTINUED.

4120
09:11:46,605 --> 09:11:48,074
BUT THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT 

4121
09:11:48,074 --> 09:11:50,443
TIME AND THIS IS A MUCH 

4122
09:11:50,443 --> 09:11:51,278
DIFFERENT PRESIDENT IN ALL 

4123
09:11:51,278 --> 09:11:51,545
FAIRNESS.

4124
09:11:51,545 --> 09:11:53,078
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

4125
09:11:53,078 --> 09:11:54,814
THIS WAS ONE OF THE PERHAPS ONE 

4126
09:11:54,814 --> 09:11:56,716
OF THE REASONS THAT I WON -- I 

4127
09:11:56,716 --> 09:12:00,453
CAMPAIGNED ON THIS ISSUES AS YOU

4128
09:12:00,453 --> 09:12:01,121
KNOW VERY WELL.

4129
09:12:01,121 --> 09:12:01,987
WHOEVER THOSE PEOPLE ARE.

4130
09:12:01,987 --> 09:12:03,055
I CANNOT SEE YOU WITH ALL THE 

4131
09:12:03,055 --> 09:12:04,424
LIGHTS BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE 

4132
09:12:04,424 --> 09:12:08,528
EITHER OF THE TWO -- YEAH, GO 

4133
09:12:08,528 --> 09:12:08,728
AHEAD.

4134
09:12:08,728 --> 09:12:08,928
SURE.

4135
09:12:08,928 --> 09:12:09,195
GO AHEAD.

4136
09:12:09,195 --> 09:12:11,765
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND 

4137
09:12:11,765 --> 09:12:12,398
FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS. 

4138
09:12:12,398 --> 09:12:12,966
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4139
09:12:12,966 --> 09:12:13,833
APPRECIATE IT.

4140
09:12:13,833 --> 09:12:17,370
>> DID YOU TOUCH ON THE ISSUE OF

4141
09:12:17,370 --> 09:12:22,875
PEACE TREATY AND ALSO WILL YOU 

4142
09:12:22,875 --> 09:12:24,843
TRAVEL TO PYONGYANG ANY ANY TIME

4143
09:12:24,843 --> 09:12:25,044
SOON. 

4144
09:12:25,044 --> 09:12:26,411
>> THAT WILL BE A DAY I LOOK 

4145
09:12:26,411 --> 09:12:29,849
FORWARD TO AND I ALSO WILL BE 

4146
09:12:29,849 --> 09:12:31,250
INVITING CHAIRMAN KIM AT THE 

4147
09:12:31,250 --> 09:12:32,752
APPROPRIATE TIME TO THE WHITE 

4148
09:12:32,752 --> 09:12:33,720
HOUSE.

4149
09:12:33,720 --> 09:12:35,421
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE 

4150
09:12:35,421 --> 09:12:38,023
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY 

4151
09:12:38,023 --> 09:12:40,826
IMPORTANT AND HE HAS ACCEPTED.

4152
09:12:40,826 --> 09:12:41,995
I SAID AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

4153
09:12:41,995 --> 09:12:43,362
WE WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT 

4154
09:12:43,362 --> 09:12:44,531
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD.

4155
09:12:44,531 --> 09:12:47,966
BUT WHAT WE SIGNED TODAY WAS A 

4156
09:12:47,966 --> 09:12:49,968
LOT OF THINGS INCLUDED AND THEN 

4157
09:12:49,968 --> 09:12:51,771
YOU HAVE THINGS THAT WEREN'T 

4158
09:12:51,771 --> 09:12:53,273
INCLUDED THAT WE GOT AFTER THE 

4159
09:12:53,273 --> 09:12:54,140
DEAL WAS SIGNED.

4160
09:12:54,140 --> 09:12:56,275
I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE IN MY 

4161
09:12:56,275 --> 09:12:56,476
LIFE.

4162
09:12:56,476 --> 09:12:57,644
WE DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE 

4163
09:12:57,644 --> 09:12:59,112
AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE

4164
09:12:59,112 --> 09:13:00,913
TIME AND I THINK MOST OF YOU 

4165
09:13:00,913 --> 09:13:01,614
HAVE BEEN HANDED OUT THE 

4166
09:13:01,614 --> 09:13:04,784
AGREEMENT OR SOON WILL, BUT -- 

4167
09:13:04,784 --> 09:13:05,417
YOU HAVE NOT?

4168
09:13:05,417 --> 09:13:06,919
WELL, IF YOU COULD HAVE THOSE 

4169
09:13:06,919 --> 09:13:08,521
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT, WE JUST 

4170
09:13:08,521 --> 09:13:09,489
FINISHED THEM JUST A LITTLE 

4171
09:13:09,489 --> 09:13:10,123
WHILE AGO.

4172
09:13:10,123 --> 09:13:11,858
BUT IF YOU COULD HAVE THE 

4173
09:13:11,858 --> 09:13:13,292
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT, YOU'LL 

4174
09:13:13,292 --> 09:13:15,528
SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

4175
09:13:15,528 --> 09:13:18,131
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD.

4176
09:13:18,131 --> 09:13:19,765
>> CONGRATULATIONS, PRESIDENT.

4177
09:13:19,765 --> 09:13:21,301
>> THANK YOU.

4178
09:13:21,301 --> 09:13:23,169
>> WHAT PART DID JAPAN PLAY AND 

4179
09:13:23,169 --> 09:13:25,605
DID THE ABDUCTION ISSUE COME UP 

4180
09:13:25,605 --> 09:13:29,042
AND ALSO THE FATE OF THE 

4181
09:13:29,042 --> 09:13:30,443
CHRISTIANS AND THE FOLLOW-UP 

4182
09:13:30,443 --> 09:13:32,212
QUESTION IS WHEN WILL YOU BE 

4183
09:13:32,212 --> 09:13:35,949
DOING AN INTERVIEW WITH JAPANESE

4184
09:13:35,949 --> 09:13:36,449
TV?

4185
09:13:36,449 --> 09:13:38,118
50,000 AMERICAN TROOPS ARE IN 

4186
09:13:38,118 --> 09:13:38,851
JAPAN. 

4187
09:13:38,851 --> 09:13:39,718
>> 50,000 GREAT TROOPS.

4188
09:13:39,718 --> 09:13:43,223
YEAH, I DID, ABDUCTION, 

4189
09:13:43,223 --> 09:13:43,555
OBVIOUSLY.

4190
09:13:43,555 --> 09:13:44,223
PRIME MINISTER ABE, CERTAINLY 

4191
09:13:44,223 --> 09:13:47,961
OTHER THAN THE WHOLE DENUKING 

4192
09:13:47,961 --> 09:13:49,061
SUBJECT, CERTAINLY HIS, I WOULD 

4193
09:13:49,061 --> 09:13:51,197
SAY HIS MAIN POINT AND I BROUGHT

4194
09:13:51,197 --> 09:13:52,499
IT UP, ABSOLUTELY AND THEY'RE 

4195
09:13:52,499 --> 09:13:53,800
GOING TO BE WORKING ON THAT.

4196
09:13:53,800 --> 09:13:55,233
WE DIDN'T PUT IT DOWN IN THE 

4197
09:13:55,233 --> 09:13:59,472
DOCUMENT BUT IT WILL BE WORKED 

4198
09:13:59,472 --> 09:13:59,739
ON.

4199
09:13:59,739 --> 09:14:01,874
CHRISTIANS, YES, WE ARE -- 

4200
09:14:01,874 --> 09:14:04,610
BROUGHT IT UP VERY STRONGLY, 

4201
09:14:04,610 --> 09:14:06,146
FRANKLIN GRAHAM SPENT AND SPENDS

4202
09:14:06,146 --> 09:14:07,646
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME IN 

4203
09:14:07,646 --> 09:14:08,581
NORTH KOREA.

4204
09:14:08,581 --> 09:14:10,216
'GOT A VERY CLOSE TO HIS HEART.

4205
09:14:10,216 --> 09:14:11,851
IT DID COME UP AND THINGS WILL 

4206
09:14:11,851 --> 09:14:15,588
BE HAPPENING.

4207
09:14:15,588 --> 09:14:15,788
OKAY.

4208
09:14:15,788 --> 09:14:16,055
THANK YOU.

4209
09:14:16,055 --> 09:14:16,422
GREAT QUESTION.

4210
09:14:16,422 --> 09:14:24,497
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD.

4211
09:14:24,497 --> 09:14:26,066
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

4212
09:14:26,066 --> 09:14:27,534
RETURNING TO THE QUESTION OF 

4213
09:14:27,534 --> 09:14:29,869
HUMAN RIGHTS, YOU SPOKE VERY 

4214
09:14:29,869 --> 09:14:31,237
POWERFULLY ON THE ISSUE DURING 

4215
09:14:31,237 --> 09:14:33,072
YOUR STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.

4216
09:14:33,072 --> 09:14:37,042
YOU SHOWED THAT YOU HAD THE 

4217
09:14:37,042 --> 09:14:38,610
DEFECTOR IN THE FIRST LADY'S BOX

4218
09:14:38,610 --> 09:14:39,779
WITH THE CRUTCHES WHO ESCAPED 

4219
09:14:39,779 --> 09:14:41,815
AND YOU SAID AT THAT POINT NORTH

4220
09:14:41,815 --> 09:14:44,384
KOREA HAS MORE BRUTALLY 

4221
09:14:44,384 --> 09:14:45,451
OPPRESSED ITS PEOPLE THAN THEY 

4222
09:14:45,451 --> 09:14:46,786
OTHER REGIME ON EARTH.

4223
09:14:46,786 --> 09:14:48,722
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT IS THE

4224
09:14:48,722 --> 09:14:50,790
CASE HAVING SAT DOWN WITH KIM 

4225
09:14:50,790 --> 09:14:51,891
JONG-UN AND DOES HE NEED TO 

4226
09:14:51,891 --> 09:14:52,492
CHANGE THAT?

4227
09:14:52,492 --> 09:14:53,993
>> JON, I BELIEVE IT'S A ROUGH 

4228
09:14:53,993 --> 09:14:55,195
SITUATION OVER THERE.

4229
09:14:55,195 --> 09:14:56,496
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND

4230
09:14:56,496 --> 09:14:58,565
WE DID DISCUSS IT TODAY.

4231
09:14:58,565 --> 09:15:00,500
PRETTY STRONGLY, I MEAN, KNOWING

4232
09:15:00,500 --> 09:15:02,769
WHAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF WHAT WE

4233
09:15:02,769 --> 09:15:05,504
WERE DOING IS, DENUKING, BUT 

4234
09:15:05,504 --> 09:15:07,574
DISCUSSED IT AT PRETTY GOOD 

4235
09:15:07,574 --> 09:15:07,841
LENGTH.

4236
09:15:07,841 --> 09:15:10,142
WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING ON IT.

4237
09:15:10,142 --> 09:15:10,843
IT'S ROUGH.

4238
09:15:10,843 --> 09:15:12,311
IT'S ROUGH IN A LOT OF PLACES, 

4239
09:15:12,311 --> 09:15:13,913
BY THE WAY, NOT JUST THERE BUT 

4240
09:15:13,913 --> 09:15:15,949
IT'S ROUGH AND WE WILL CONTINUE 

4241
09:15:15,949 --> 09:15:17,449
THAT AND I THINK ULTIMATELY 

4242
09:15:17,449 --> 09:15:19,919
WE'LL AGREE TO SOMETHING, BUT IT

4243
09:15:19,919 --> 09:15:23,489
WAS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH OUTSIDE 

4244
09:15:23,489 --> 09:15:25,824
OF -- OUTSIDE OF THE NUCLEAR 

4245
09:15:25,824 --> 09:15:27,360
SITUATION, ONE OF THE PRIMARY 

4246
09:15:27,360 --> 09:15:27,593
TOPICS. 

4247
09:15:27,593 --> 09:15:30,296
>> BUT DO YOU THINK THAT NEEDS 

4248
09:15:30,296 --> 09:15:30,896
TO CHANGE TO BRING ON THIS 

4249
09:15:30,896 --> 09:15:32,265
GLORIOUS NEW ERA YOU TALKED 

4250
09:15:32,265 --> 09:15:32,498
ABOUT?

4251
09:15:32,498 --> 09:15:34,033
>> I THINK IT WILL CHANGE, YEAH.

4252
09:15:34,033 --> 09:15:35,434
I THINK IT PROBABLY HAS TO BUT I

4253
09:15:35,434 --> 09:15:36,368
THINK IT WILL, YEAH.

4254
09:15:36,368 --> 09:15:36,635
THANK YOU.

4255
09:15:36,635 --> 09:15:39,439
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4256
09:15:39,439 --> 09:15:39,639
STEVE.

4257
09:15:39,639 --> 09:15:40,639
THAT'S YOU, STEVE, RIGHT THERE. 

4258
09:15:40,639 --> 09:15:42,275
>> YES, SIR, THANK YOU.

4259
09:15:42,275 --> 09:15:44,377
WHAT TIMETABLE DO YOU ENVISION 

4260
09:15:44,377 --> 09:15:45,711
FOR THEIR DENUCLEARIZATION AND 

4261
09:15:45,711 --> 09:15:47,313
IN THE MEANTIME, ARE YOU 

4262
09:15:47,313 --> 09:15:48,481
THINKING ABOUT EASING ANY 

4263
09:15:48,481 --> 09:15:48,748
SANCTIONS?

4264
09:15:48,748 --> 09:15:50,182
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, 

4265
09:15:50,182 --> 09:15:51,084
SCIENTIFICALLY I'VE BEEN 

4266
09:15:51,084 --> 09:15:53,519
WATCHING AND READING A LOT ABOUT

4267
09:15:53,519 --> 09:15:55,053
THIS AND IT DOES TAKE A LONG 

4268
09:15:55,053 --> 09:15:57,723
TIME TO, YOU KNOW, PULL OFF 

4269
09:15:57,723 --> 09:15:58,992
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION, IT 

4270
09:15:58,992 --> 09:16:01,360
TAKES A LONG TIME, 

4271
09:16:01,360 --> 09:16:03,029
SCIENTIFICALLY, YOU HAVE TO WAIT

4272
09:16:03,029 --> 09:16:04,362
CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME AND A 

4273
09:16:04,362 --> 09:16:06,499
LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN, BUT 

4274
09:16:06,499 --> 09:16:08,400
DESPITE THAT, ONCE YOU START THE

4275
09:16:08,400 --> 09:16:10,470
PROCESS, IT MEANS IT'S PRETTY 

4276
09:16:10,470 --> 09:16:10,936
MUCH OVER.

4277
09:16:10,936 --> 09:16:12,372
YOU CAN'T USE THEM.

4278
09:16:12,372 --> 09:16:13,473
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS AND THAT'S 

4279
09:16:13,473 --> 09:16:14,607
GOING TO START VERY SOON, I 

4280
09:16:14,607 --> 09:16:15,708
BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO START 

4281
09:16:15,708 --> 09:16:16,542
VERY SOON.

4282
09:16:16,542 --> 09:16:18,877
WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS IT CAN 

4283
09:16:18,877 --> 09:16:21,112
MECHANICALLY AND PHYSICALLY BE 

4284
09:16:21,112 --> 09:16:21,413
DONE, STEVE.

4285
09:16:21,413 --> 09:16:22,447
>> AND THE SANCTIONS. 

4286
09:16:22,447 --> 09:16:24,851
>> THE SANCTIONS WILL COME OFF 

4287
09:16:24,851 --> 09:16:27,220
WHEN WE ARE SURE THAT THE NUKES 

4288
09:16:27,220 --> 09:16:30,190
ARE NO LONGER A FACTOR.

4289
09:16:30,190 --> 09:16:32,392
SANCTIONS PLAYED A BIG ROLE, BUT

4290
09:16:32,392 --> 09:16:33,660
THEY'LL COME OFF AT THAT POINT.

4291
09:16:33,660 --> 09:16:35,695
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE SOON BUT

4292
09:16:35,695 --> 09:16:37,129
THEY'LL COME OFF -- AS YOU KNOW 

4293
09:16:37,129 --> 09:16:38,731
AND AS I'VE SAID, THE SANCTIONS 

4294
09:16:38,731 --> 09:16:40,533
RIGHT NOW REMAIN BUT AT A 

4295
09:16:40,533 --> 09:16:41,500
CERTAIN POINT I ACTUALLY LOOK 

4296
09:16:41,500 --> 09:16:43,269
FORWARD TO TAKING THEM OFF AND 

4297
09:16:43,269 --> 09:16:45,137
THEY'LL COME OFF WHEN WE KNOW 

4298
09:16:45,137 --> 09:16:47,140
WE'RE DOWN THE ROAD WHERE IT'S 

4299
09:16:47,140 --> 09:16:47,974
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

4300
09:16:47,974 --> 09:16:49,142
NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

4301
09:16:49,142 --> 09:16:49,341
OKAY.

4302
09:16:49,341 --> 09:16:50,809
>> THANK YOU.

4303
09:16:50,809 --> 09:16:51,243
>> MR. PRESIDENT.

4304
09:16:51,243 --> 09:16:52,545
>> GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

4305
09:16:52,545 --> 09:16:53,713
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

4306
09:16:53,713 --> 09:16:54,814
>> THANK YOU. 

4307
09:16:54,814 --> 09:16:55,848
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS 

4308
09:16:55,848 --> 09:16:56,381
HISTORIC SUMMIT. 

4309
09:16:56,381 --> 09:16:57,817
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4310
09:16:57,817 --> 09:16:58,785
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY, BY

4311
09:16:58,785 --> 09:17:00,386
THE WAY.

4312
09:17:00,386 --> 09:17:02,288
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY.

4313
09:17:02,288 --> 09:17:02,588
GO AHEAD. 

4314
09:17:02,588 --> 09:17:04,790
>> YOU SIGNED A DOCUMENT WITH 

4315
09:17:04,790 --> 09:17:05,792
KIM JONG-UN.

4316
09:17:05,792 --> 09:17:07,260
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A PIECE OF 

4317
09:17:07,260 --> 09:17:07,527
PAPER.

4318
09:17:07,527 --> 09:17:08,928
YESTERDAY WE HAD A BRIEFING FROM

4319
09:17:08,928 --> 09:17:10,629
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MIKE 

4320
09:17:10,629 --> 09:17:12,430
POMPEO AND HE SAID THE 

4321
09:17:12,430 --> 09:17:14,033
FOLLOWING, MANY PRESIDENTS 

4322
09:17:14,033 --> 09:17:15,601
PREVIOUSLY HAVE SIGNED OFF ON 

4323
09:17:15,601 --> 09:17:17,336
PIECES OF PAPER, ONLY TO FIND 

4324
09:17:17,336 --> 09:17:18,905
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS EITHER 

4325
09:17:18,905 --> 09:17:20,572
DIDN'T PROMISE WHAT WE THOUGHT 

4326
09:17:20,572 --> 09:17:23,443
THEY HAD OR ACTUALLY RENEGED ON 

4327
09:17:23,443 --> 09:17:24,277
THOSE PROMISES.

4328
09:17:24,277 --> 09:17:25,945
WHAT MAKES THIS TIME DIFFERENT, 

4329
09:17:25,945 --> 09:17:26,311
MR. PRESIDENT. 

4330
09:17:26,311 --> 09:17:27,547
>> WELL, YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT 

4331
09:17:27,547 --> 09:17:27,913
ADMINISTRATION.

4332
09:17:27,913 --> 09:17:29,482
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT.

4333
09:17:29,482 --> 09:17:32,085
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SECRETARY 

4334
09:17:32,085 --> 09:17:32,552
OF STATE.

4335
09:17:32,552 --> 09:17:35,421
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE, NOW 

4336
09:17:35,421 --> 09:17:36,288
HE, VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM AND 

4337
09:17:36,288 --> 09:17:39,659
WE GET IT DONE.

4338
09:17:39,659 --> 09:17:41,127
THE OTHER GROUPS MAYBE IT WASN'T

4339
09:17:41,127 --> 09:17:41,728
A PRIORITY.

4340
09:17:41,728 --> 09:17:42,495
I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE 

4341
09:17:42,495 --> 09:17:44,229
DONE IT IF IT WAS A PRIORITY, 

4342
09:17:44,229 --> 09:17:44,531
FRANKLY.

4343
09:17:44,531 --> 09:17:45,732
I DON'T THINK THEY HONESTLY 

4344
09:17:45,732 --> 09:17:47,066
COULD HAVE DONE IT EVEN IF IT 

4345
09:17:47,066 --> 09:17:48,500
WAS A PRIORITY.

4346
09:17:48,500 --> 09:17:49,968
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER 

4347
09:17:49,968 --> 09:17:51,871
BACK THEN, WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR 

4348
09:17:51,871 --> 09:17:53,873
ME MUCH EASIER IF THIS WERE TEN 

4349
09:17:53,873 --> 09:17:56,108
YEARS AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO AND 

4350
09:17:56,108 --> 09:17:57,644
I'M NOT JUST BLAMING PRESIDENT 

4351
09:17:57,644 --> 09:17:57,843
OBAMA.

4352
09:17:57,843 --> 09:17:59,512
THIS GOES BACK FOR 25 YEARS THIS

4353
09:17:59,512 --> 09:18:00,413
SHOULD DR. HAPPENED.

4354
09:18:00,413 --> 09:18:03,016
I WAS GIVEN A VERY TOUGH HAND.

4355
09:18:03,016 --> 09:18:03,616
I WAS GIVEN THIS.

4356
09:18:03,616 --> 09:18:05,985
I WAS GIVEN THE IRAN DEAL AND 

4357
09:18:05,985 --> 09:18:10,156
PLENTY OF OTHER PROBLEMS, BUT WE

4358
09:18:10,156 --> 09:18:11,256
ARE -- WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL 

4359
09:18:11,256 --> 09:18:13,259
AND THE IRAN DEAL, I HAVE TO BE 

4360
09:18:13,259 --> 09:18:15,228
HONEST, I DID IT BECAUSE NUCLEAR

4361
09:18:15,228 --> 09:18:16,328
IS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE TO ME.

4362
09:18:16,328 --> 09:18:18,898
NUCLEAR IS NUMBER ONE.

4363
09:18:18,898 --> 09:18:20,532
BUT ON THE IRAN DEAL, I THINK 

4364
09:18:20,532 --> 09:18:22,569
IRAN IS A DIFFERENT COUNTRY NOW 

4365
09:18:22,569 --> 09:18:24,269
THAN IT WAS THREE OR FOUR MONTHS

4366
09:18:24,269 --> 09:18:24,536
AGO.

4367
09:18:24,536 --> 09:18:25,571
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING SO

4368
09:18:25,571 --> 09:18:27,239
MUCH TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.

4369
09:18:27,239 --> 09:18:29,475
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING SO

4370
09:18:29,475 --> 09:18:31,945
MUCH AT SYRIA LIKE THEY WERE 

4371
09:18:31,945 --> 09:18:32,911
WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE.

4372
09:18:32,911 --> 09:18:34,146
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SO 

4373
09:18:34,146 --> 09:18:35,481
CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW BUT I HOPE 

4374
09:18:35,481 --> 09:18:36,949
WITH THAT BEING SAID I HOPE THAT

4375
09:18:36,949 --> 09:18:39,752
AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AFTER 

4376
09:18:39,752 --> 09:18:41,320
THE SANCTIONS KICK IN AND THEY 

4377
09:18:41,320 --> 09:18:44,924
ARE BRUTAL WHAT WE'VE PUT ON 

4378
09:18:44,924 --> 09:18:47,025
IRAN, I HOPE THAT THEY'RE GOING 

4379
09:18:47,025 --> 09:18:48,161
TO COME BACK AND FOESHT A REAL 

4380
09:18:48,161 --> 09:18:48,528
DEAL.

4381
09:18:48,528 --> 09:18:50,296
I'D LOVE TO DO THAT BUT RIGHT 

4382
09:18:50,296 --> 09:18:52,599
NOW IT'S TOO SOON FOR THAT.

4383
09:18:52,599 --> 09:18:52,765
YES.

4384
09:18:52,765 --> 09:18:55,468
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ALSO TALK 

4385
09:18:55,468 --> 09:18:59,172
ABOUT ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC 

4386
09:18:59,172 --> 09:18:59,839
RELATIONS, EXCHANGING 

4387
09:18:59,839 --> 09:19:00,273
AMBASSADORS.

4388
09:19:00,273 --> 09:19:01,908
HOW LONG BEFORE THAT HAPPENS?

4389
09:19:01,908 --> 09:19:03,108
>> GOOD QUESTION.

4390
09:19:03,108 --> 09:19:04,042
HOPEFULLY SOON.

4391
09:19:04,042 --> 09:19:05,678
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO GET THINGS 

4392
09:19:05,678 --> 09:19:06,713
MOVING FIRST.

4393
09:19:06,713 --> 09:19:08,348
VERY -- A LITTLE EARLY FOR THAT.

4394
09:19:08,348 --> 09:19:09,716
WE HAVE TO GET THINGS MOVING.

4395
09:19:09,716 --> 09:19:14,354
YES, GO AHEAD.

4396
09:19:14,354 --> 09:19:14,621
HI.

4397
09:19:14,621 --> 09:19:16,522
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY WHEN YOU SAID

4398
09:19:16,522 --> 09:19:18,257
YOU'RE STOPPING WAR GAMES SO YOU

4399
09:19:18,257 --> 09:19:20,526
ARE STOPPING THE MILITARY 

4400
09:19:20,526 --> 09:19:21,361
EXERCISES CAN SOUTH KOREA. 

4401
09:19:21,361 --> 09:19:24,697
>> YEAH, WE'VE DONE EXERCISES 

4402
09:19:24,697 --> 09:19:26,299
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME 

4403
09:19:26,299 --> 09:19:27,800
WORKING WITH SOUTH KOREA AND WE 

4404
09:19:27,800 --> 09:19:29,935
CALL THEM WAR GAMES, I CALL THEM

4405
09:19:29,935 --> 09:19:32,372
WAR GAMES AND THEY'RE 

4406
09:19:32,372 --> 09:19:33,973
TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE, THE 

4407
09:19:33,973 --> 09:19:36,943
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON THAT

4408
09:19:36,943 --> 09:19:38,177
IS INCREDIBLE AND SOUTH KOREA 

4409
09:19:38,177 --> 09:19:41,480
CONTRIBUTES BUT NOT 100% WHICH 

4410
09:19:41,480 --> 09:19:43,249
IS CERTAINLY A SUBJECT THAT WE 

4411
09:19:43,249 --> 09:19:44,950
HAVE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT ALSO 

4412
09:19:44,950 --> 09:19:46,719
AND HAS TO DO WITH THE MILITARY 

4413
09:19:46,719 --> 09:19:49,322
EXPENSE AND ALSO THE TRADE.

4414
09:19:49,322 --> 09:19:50,223
SO WE'RE DOING THAT.

4415
09:19:50,223 --> 09:19:51,624
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEW DEAL WITH

4416
09:19:51,624 --> 09:19:52,725
SOUTH KOREA IN TERMS OF THE 

4417
09:19:52,725 --> 09:19:53,759
TRADE DEAL BUT WE HAVE TO TALK 

4418
09:19:53,759 --> 09:19:54,494
TO THEM.

4419
09:19:54,494 --> 09:19:56,262
WE HAVE TO TALK TO MANY COU

4420
09:19:56,262 --> 09:19:57,196
COUNTRIES ABOUT TREATING US 

4421
09:19:57,196 --> 09:19:58,397
FAIRLY BUT THE WAR GAMES ARE 

4422
09:19:58,397 --> 09:19:59,298
VERY EXPENSIVE.

4423
09:19:59,298 --> 09:20:01,167
WE PAY FOR A BIG MAJORITY OF 

4424
09:20:01,167 --> 09:20:01,367
THEM.

4425
09:20:01,367 --> 09:20:03,736
WE FLY IN BOMBERS FROM GUAM.

4426
09:20:03,736 --> 09:20:05,705
I SAID IT WHEN I FIRST STARTED, 

4427
09:20:05,705 --> 09:20:08,207
I SAID WHERE DO THE BOMBERS COME

4428
09:20:08,207 --> 09:20:08,407
FROM?

4429
09:20:08,407 --> 09:20:08,607
GUAM.

4430
09:20:08,607 --> 09:20:08,841
NEARBY.

4431
09:20:08,841 --> 09:20:10,643
I SAID, OH, GREAT, NEARBY.

4432
09:20:10,643 --> 09:20:12,278
WHERE IS NEARBY?

4433
09:20:12,278 --> 09:20:14,013
6 1/2 HOURS.

4434
09:20:14,013 --> 09:20:16,015
6 1/2 HOURS IS A LONG TIME FOR 

4435
09:20:16,015 --> 09:20:19,218
THESE BIG MASSIVE PLANES TO BE 

4436
09:20:19,218 --> 09:20:20,586
FLYING TO SOUTH KOREA TO 

4437
09:20:20,586 --> 09:20:22,155
PRACTICE AND THEN DROP BOMBS ALL

4438
09:20:22,155 --> 09:20:24,390
OVER THE PLACE AND THEN GO BACK 

4439
09:20:24,390 --> 09:20:24,924
TO GUAM.

4440
09:20:24,924 --> 09:20:27,226
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT AIRPLANES.

4441
09:20:27,226 --> 09:20:28,394
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

4442
09:20:28,394 --> 09:20:30,496
AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

4443
09:20:30,496 --> 09:20:32,465
AND WHAT I DID SAY IS AND I 

4444
09:20:32,465 --> 09:20:34,133
THINK IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE, I 

4445
09:20:34,133 --> 09:20:36,669
HAVE TO TELL YOU, JENNIFER.

4446
09:20:36,669 --> 09:20:39,772
IT'S A VERY PROVOCATIVE 

4447
09:20:39,772 --> 09:20:40,540
SITUATION.

4448
09:20:40,540 --> 09:20:42,975
WHEN I SEE THAT AND YOU HAVE A 

4449
09:20:42,975 --> 09:20:44,643
COUNTRY RIGHT NEXT DOOR, SO 

4450
09:20:44,643 --> 09:20:46,479
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 

4451
09:20:46,479 --> 09:20:48,881
WE'RE NEGOTIATING A VERY 

4452
09:20:48,881 --> 09:20:49,615
COMPREHENSIVE, COMPLETE DEAL, I 

4453
09:20:49,615 --> 09:20:50,916
THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO BE 

4454
09:20:50,916 --> 09:20:52,552
HAVING WAR GAMES.

4455
09:20:52,552 --> 09:20:54,387
SO NUMBER ONE WE SAVE MONEY.

4456
09:20:54,387 --> 09:20:55,688
A LOT.

4457
09:20:55,688 --> 09:20:58,057
AND NUMBER TWO, IT REALLY IS 

4458
09:20:58,057 --> 09:21:00,659
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THEY'RE 

4459
09:21:00,659 --> 09:21:01,593
VERY MUCH APPRECIATING. 

4460
09:21:01,593 --> 09:21:02,561
>> DOES NORTH KOREA GIVE YOU 

4461
09:21:02,561 --> 09:21:03,462
SOMETHING IN RETURN, THOUGH?

4462
09:21:03,462 --> 09:21:05,164
>> WELL, WE'VE GOTTEN -- I'VE 

4463
09:21:05,164 --> 09:21:05,832
HEARD THAT.

4464
09:21:05,832 --> 09:21:08,433
I MEAN, SOME OF THE PEOPLE 

4465
09:21:08,433 --> 09:21:09,936
THAT -- I DON'T KNOW.

4466
09:21:09,936 --> 09:21:11,637
MAYBE THEY REALLY MEAN IT.

4467
09:21:11,637 --> 09:21:13,339
I DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO GO 

4468
09:21:13,339 --> 09:21:14,273
AGAINST THE PRESS, ESPECIALLY 

4469
09:21:14,273 --> 09:21:15,108
NOT TODAY THIS.

4470
09:21:15,108 --> 09:21:16,275
IS TOO IMPORTANT BUT I NOTICE 

4471
09:21:16,275 --> 09:21:18,410
THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE 

4472
09:21:18,410 --> 09:21:20,513
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

4473
09:21:20,513 --> 09:21:22,715
AGREED TO MEET, HE HAS GIVEN UP 

4474
09:21:22,715 --> 09:21:23,049
SO MUCH.

4475
09:21:23,049 --> 09:21:24,016
I GAVE UP NOTHING.

4476
09:21:24,016 --> 09:21:24,917
I'M HERE.

4477
09:21:24,917 --> 09:21:26,685
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 25 HOURS BUT 

4478
09:21:26,685 --> 09:21:28,254
I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO 

4479
09:21:28,254 --> 09:21:30,456
DO BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN 

4480
09:21:30,456 --> 09:21:32,158
NEGOTIATING FOR LITERALLY AROUND

4481
09:21:32,158 --> 09:21:35,161
THE CLOCK WITH THEM AND WITH US 

4482
09:21:35,161 --> 09:21:38,631
AND WITH JOHN AND MIKE AND A 

4483
09:21:38,631 --> 09:21:41,300
WHOLE TEAM OF TALENTED PEOPLE.

4484
09:21:41,300 --> 09:21:43,436
BUT WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ANYTHING

4485
09:21:43,436 --> 09:21:45,671
OTHER THAN YOU'RE RIGHT, I 

4486
09:21:45,671 --> 09:21:48,441
AGREED TO MEET AND I THINK THE 

4487
09:21:48,441 --> 09:21:49,608
MEETING WAS EVERY BIT AS GOOD 

4488
09:21:49,608 --> 09:21:52,077
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS IT WAS 

4489
09:21:52,077 --> 09:21:54,880
FOR NORTH KOREA, BUT I JUST 

4490
09:21:54,880 --> 09:21:58,351
WROTE DOWN SOME OF THE THINGS WE

4491
09:21:58,351 --> 09:22:00,319
GOT, AND THEY -- YOU KNOW, SURE,

4492
09:22:00,319 --> 09:22:02,388
THEY GOT A MEETING BUT ONLY A 

4493
09:22:02,388 --> 09:22:03,722
PERSON THAT DISLIKES DONALD 

4494
09:22:03,722 --> 09:22:06,225
TRUMP WOULD SAY THAT I'VE AGREED

4495
09:22:06,225 --> 09:22:08,294
TO MAKE A BIG COMMITMENT.

4496
09:22:08,294 --> 09:22:09,428
SURE, I'VE AGREED TO TAKE A 

4497
09:22:09,428 --> 09:22:12,031
PERIOD OF TIME AND COME HERE AND

4498
09:22:12,031 --> 09:22:13,299
MEET AND THAT'S GOOD BUT I THINK

4499
09:22:13,299 --> 09:22:14,633
IT'S GREAT FOR US AND AS A 

4500
09:22:14,633 --> 09:22:16,335
COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S GOOD 

4501
09:22:16,335 --> 09:22:17,470
FOR THEM.

4502
09:22:17,470 --> 09:22:21,106
BUT WHAT DID THEY DO TO JUSTIFY 

4503
09:22:21,106 --> 09:22:23,209
THIS MEETING?

4504
09:22:23,209 --> 09:22:27,747
SECURED COMMITMENT FOR COMPLETE 

4505
09:22:27,747 --> 09:22:28,381
DENUCLEARIZATION.

4506
09:22:28,381 --> 09:22:29,849
THAT'S THE BIG THING.

4507
09:22:29,849 --> 09:22:31,851
THEY SECURED THE RELEASE OF 

4508
09:22:31,851 --> 09:22:33,619
THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES.

4509
09:22:33,619 --> 09:22:35,321
THEY ALREADY GAVE THEM TO US TWO

4510
09:22:35,321 --> 09:22:36,622
MONTHS AGO.

4511
09:22:36,622 --> 09:22:38,124
THESE PEOPLE NOW LIVING HAPPILY 

4512
09:22:38,124 --> 09:22:41,060
BACK IN THEIR HOMES WITH THEIR 

4513
09:22:41,060 --> 09:22:41,360
FAMILIES.

4514
09:22:41,360 --> 09:22:44,063
AND IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH FOR 

4515
09:22:44,063 --> 09:22:44,263
THEM.

4516
09:22:44,263 --> 09:22:46,732
TO PUT IT MILDLY.

4517
09:22:46,732 --> 09:22:48,935
SECURED THE COMMITMENT TO 

4518
09:22:48,935 --> 09:22:51,437
RECOVER THE REMAINS INCLUDING 

4519
09:22:51,437 --> 09:22:55,174
THESE ARE OF FALLEN HEROES AND 

4520
09:22:55,174 --> 09:22:56,843
THEY'RE GIVING A COMMITMENT.

4521
09:22:56,843 --> 09:22:57,609
THEY'RE STARTING IT IMMEDIATELY 

4522
09:22:57,609 --> 09:24:14,320
TO RECOVER THE REMAINS AND I 

4523
09:24:14,320 --> 09:24:16,755
TESTS THEY SECURED THE CLOSURE 

4524
09:24:16,755 --> 09:24:20,693
OF THEIR SINGLE PRIMARY NUCLEAR 

4525
09:24:20,693 --> 09:24:22,395
TEST FLIGHT, TEST SITE, ALL 

4526
09:24:22,395 --> 09:24:24,797
THREE OF THEM THERE IN AN AREA 

4527
09:24:24,797 --> 09:24:26,766
THAT'S COMMON AROUND EACH OTHER.

4528
09:24:26,766 --> 09:24:28,868
THEY SECURED THE CLOSURE.

4529
09:24:28,868 --> 09:24:31,871
THEY SECURED THE COMMITMENT TO 

4530
09:24:31,871 --> 09:24:33,138
DESTROY THE MISSILE ENGINE 

4531
09:24:33,138 --> 09:24:33,839
TESTING SITE.

4532
09:24:33,839 --> 09:24:35,007
THAT WAS NOT IN YOUR AGREEMENT.

4533
09:24:35,007 --> 09:24:37,276
I GOT THAT AFTER WE SIGNED THE 

4534
09:24:37,276 --> 09:24:37,543
AGREEMENT.

4535
09:24:37,543 --> 09:24:39,611
I SAID, DO ME A FAVOR, YOU'VE 

4536
09:24:39,611 --> 09:24:41,981
GOT THIS MISSILE ENGINE TESTING 

4537
09:24:41,981 --> 09:24:42,181
SITE.

4538
09:24:42,181 --> 09:24:43,649
WE KNOW WHERE IT IS.

4539
09:24:43,649 --> 09:24:45,685
BECAUSE OF THE HEAT, IT'S 

4540
09:24:45,685 --> 09:24:46,319
INCREDIBLE, THE EQUIPMENT WE 

4541
09:24:46,319 --> 09:24:48,287
HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

4542
09:24:48,287 --> 09:24:50,456
I SAID, CAN YOU CLOSE IT UP?

4543
09:24:50,456 --> 09:24:51,624
HE'S GOING TO CLOSE IT UP.

4544
09:24:51,624 --> 09:24:55,828
WE MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO 

4545
09:24:55,828 --> 09:24:57,262
CONTINUE TO APPLY SANCTIONS SO 

4546
09:24:57,262 --> 09:24:59,899
WE'RE APPLYING SANCTIONS.

4547
09:24:59,899 --> 09:25:01,367
NOW, I HAD 300 SANCTIONS I WAS 

4548
09:25:01,367 --> 09:25:02,535
GETTING READY TO PUT ON LAST 

4549
09:25:02,535 --> 09:25:04,103
WEEK AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, I 

4550
09:25:04,103 --> 09:25:05,404
CAN'T PUT ON SANCTIONS WHEN I'M 

4551
09:25:05,404 --> 09:25:07,440
MEETING -- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

4552
09:25:07,440 --> 09:25:08,541
VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

4553
09:25:08,541 --> 09:25:11,644
300 VERY BIG ONES, POWERFUL 

4554
09:25:11,644 --> 09:25:14,013
ONES, AND I SAID IT WOULD BE 

4555
09:25:14,013 --> 09:25:14,947
DISRESPECTFUL SO, JENNIFER, WHEN

4556
09:25:14,947 --> 09:25:17,616
YOU LOOK AT ALL THOSE THINGS WE 

4557
09:25:17,616 --> 09:25:23,189
GOT, AND WHEN WE GOT OUR 

4558
09:25:23,189 --> 09:25:23,756
HOSTAGES BACK, I DIDN'T PAY 

4559
09:25:23,756 --> 09:25:25,491
1.8 BILLION IN CASH LIKE THE 

4560
09:25:25,491 --> 09:25:26,892
HOSTAGES THAT CAME BACK FROM 

4561
09:25:26,892 --> 09:25:29,695
IRAN WHICH WAS A DISGRACEFUL 

4562
09:25:29,695 --> 09:25:31,931
SITUATION, WHAT TOOK PLACE.

4563
09:25:31,931 --> 09:25:33,832
SO WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT SO WHEN I 

4564
09:25:33,832 --> 09:25:36,802
HEAR SOMEBODY IN THE MEDIA SAY 

4565
09:25:36,802 --> 09:25:39,438
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS AGREED 

4566
09:25:39,438 --> 09:25:41,340
TO MEET LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL

4567
09:25:41,340 --> 09:25:41,807
TO MEET.

4568
09:25:41,807 --> 09:25:44,009
I THINK WE SHOULD MEET ON A LOT 

4569
09:25:44,009 --> 09:25:45,578
OF DIFFERENT TOPICS, NOT JUST 

4570
09:25:45,578 --> 09:25:46,845
THIS ONE AND I REALLY BELIEVE A 

4571
09:25:46,845 --> 09:25:48,513
LOT OF GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN, 

4572
09:25:48,513 --> 09:25:52,918
YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

4573
09:25:52,918 --> 09:25:54,787
>> SIR, YOU JUST LISTED OFF A 

4574
09:25:54,787 --> 09:25:56,588
LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU GOT IN 

4575
09:25:56,588 --> 09:25:57,323
THIS MEETING.

4576
09:25:57,323 --> 09:25:58,690
IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO YOU SAID 

4577
09:25:58,690 --> 09:26:00,526
YOU DEFINE SUCCESS OF THIS 

4578
09:26:00,526 --> 09:26:02,495
MEETING BY NORTH KOREA GIVING UP

4579
09:26:02,495 --> 09:26:04,196
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON. 

4580
09:26:04,196 --> 09:26:05,231
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 

4581
09:26:05,231 --> 09:26:07,033
>> TALK ABOUT HOW -- 

4582
09:26:07,033 --> 09:26:10,736
>> I DON'T THINK -- 

4583
09:26:10,736 --> 09:26:14,607
>> KIM JONG-UN FOR A COMPLETE 

4584
09:26:14,607 --> 09:26:15,140
VERIFIABLE IRREVERSIBLE 

4585
09:26:15,140 --> 09:26:16,375
DENUCLEARIZATION AND CAN YOU SAY

4586
09:26:16,375 --> 09:26:18,243
WHY YOU DIDN'T SECURE THOSE 

4587
09:26:18,243 --> 09:26:19,512
DETAILS IN THIS AGREEMENT?

4588
09:26:19,512 --> 09:26:21,013
>> BECAUSE THERE'S NO TIME.

4589
09:26:21,013 --> 09:26:21,947
I'M HERE ONE DAY.

4590
09:26:21,947 --> 09:26:26,185
WE'RE TOGETHER FOR MANY HOURS 

4591
09:26:26,185 --> 09:26:26,985
INTENSIVELY BUT THE PROCESS IS 

4592
09:26:26,985 --> 09:26:28,553
NOW GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND I 

4593
09:26:28,553 --> 09:26:29,822
WOULD BE SURPRISED, MIKE, IF 

4594
09:26:29,822 --> 09:26:31,757
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED 

4595
09:26:31,757 --> 09:26:32,191
ALREADY.

4596
09:26:32,191 --> 09:26:32,591
THEY HAVE STARTED.

4597
09:26:32,591 --> 09:26:33,826
THEY BLEW UP THEIR SITES.

4598
09:26:33,826 --> 09:26:36,929
THEY BLEW UP THEIR TESTING SITE.

4599
09:26:36,929 --> 09:26:40,899
SO BUT I WILL SAY HE KNEW PRIOR 

4600
09:26:40,899 --> 09:26:42,401
TO COMING -- IT WASN'T LIKE A 

4601
09:26:42,401 --> 09:26:42,835
SURPRISE.

4602
09:26:42,835 --> 09:26:44,136
IT WASN'T LIKE WE'VE NEVER 

4603
09:26:44,136 --> 09:26:45,738
DISCUSSED IT.

4604
09:26:45,738 --> 09:26:48,273
WE DISCUSSED IT, MIKE DISCUSSED 

4605
09:26:48,273 --> 09:26:50,443
IT VERY STRONGLY WITH HIS 

4606
09:26:50,443 --> 09:26:51,143
COUNTERPART IN NORTH KOREA.

4607
09:26:51,143 --> 09:26:53,446
THEY KNEW THAT THIS WAS -- LET'S

4608
09:26:53,446 --> 09:26:55,481
SAY THEY DIDN'T AGREE TO IT, I 

4609
09:26:55,481 --> 09:26:56,415
COULDN'T SIGN ANY AGREEMENT.

4610
09:26:56,415 --> 09:26:57,449
THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT THAT 

4611
09:26:57,449 --> 09:26:58,684
COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED SO THEY 

4612
09:26:58,684 --> 09:27:01,053
UNDERSTOOD THAT.

4613
09:27:01,053 --> 09:27:03,689
AND IT WASN'T A BIG POINT TODAY 

4614
09:27:03,689 --> 09:27:04,456
BECAUSE REALLY THIS HAD BEEN 

4615
09:27:04,456 --> 09:27:05,924
TAKEN CARE OF MORE THAN ANY 

4616
09:27:05,924 --> 09:27:07,693
OTHER THING BECAUSE IT WAS ALL 

4617
09:27:07,693 --> 09:27:09,261
ABOUT THIS, THIS HAS BEEN TAKEN 

4618
09:27:09,261 --> 09:27:10,896
CARE OF BEFORE WE GOT HERE SO 

4619
09:27:10,896 --> 09:27:12,764
WHEN WE BROUGHT THAT UP TODAY, 

4620
09:27:12,764 --> 09:27:15,101
YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE IS VERY 

4621
09:27:15,101 --> 09:27:15,334
STRONG.

4622
09:27:15,334 --> 09:27:15,801
IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT.

4623
09:27:15,801 --> 09:27:19,305
YES, MA'AM.

4624
09:27:19,305 --> 09:27:20,940
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

4625
09:27:20,940 --> 09:27:21,907
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

4626
09:27:21,907 --> 09:27:23,442
MILITARY CONSEQUENCES FOR NORTH 

4627
09:27:23,442 --> 09:27:24,710
KOREA IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW 

4628
09:27:24,710 --> 09:27:25,777
THROUGH ON THE COMMITMENTS THAT 

4629
09:27:25,777 --> 09:27:26,678
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. 

4630
09:27:26,678 --> 09:27:28,513
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO -- 

4631
09:27:28,513 --> 09:27:29,414
THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO TALK 

4632
09:27:29,414 --> 09:27:31,417
ABOUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE

4633
09:27:31,417 --> 09:27:31,917
THREATENING.

4634
09:27:31,917 --> 09:27:34,286
I DON'T WANT TO BE THREATENING.

4635
09:27:34,286 --> 09:27:35,754
THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND YOU'VE 

4636
09:27:35,754 --> 09:27:39,424
SEEN WHAT WAS PERHAPS GOING TO 

4637
09:27:39,424 --> 09:27:41,327
HAPPEN AND SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION 

4638
09:27:41,327 --> 09:27:41,660
PEOPLE.

4639
09:27:41,660 --> 09:27:43,695
WE THINK WE HAVE BIG CITIES.

4640
09:27:43,695 --> 09:27:45,097
YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK WHERE IT 

4641
09:27:45,097 --> 09:27:45,831
HAS 8 MILLION.

4642
09:27:45,831 --> 09:27:47,733
WE THINK IT'S A BIG CITY.

4643
09:27:47,733 --> 09:27:49,068
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE.

4644
09:27:49,068 --> 09:27:49,835
THINK OF THAT.

4645
09:27:49,835 --> 09:27:52,071
AND IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE 

4646
09:27:52,071 --> 09:27:52,505
BORDER.

4647
09:27:52,505 --> 09:27:56,208
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE DMZ.

4648
09:27:56,208 --> 09:27:56,775
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

4649
09:27:56,775 --> 09:27:59,178
I MEAN, IF THIS WOULD HAVE 

4650
09:27:59,178 --> 09:28:01,013
HAPPENED, I THINK -- I'VE HEARD,

4651
09:28:01,013 --> 09:28:02,281
OH, 100,000 PEOPLE.

4652
09:28:02,281 --> 09:28:03,815
I THINK YOU COULD HAVE LOST 20 

4653
09:28:03,815 --> 09:28:06,819
MILLION PEOPLE, 30 MILLION 

4654
09:28:06,819 --> 09:28:07,052
PEOPLE.

4655
09:28:07,052 --> 09:28:08,353
THIS IS REALLY AN HONOR FOR ME 

4656
09:28:08,353 --> 09:28:09,388
TO BE DOING THIS BECAUSE I 

4657
09:28:09,388 --> 09:28:11,190
THINK, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY YOU

4658
09:28:11,190 --> 09:28:13,025
COULD HAVE LOST, YOU KNOW, 30, 

4659
09:28:13,025 --> 09:28:14,160
40, 50 MILLION PEOPLE.

4660
09:28:14,160 --> 09:28:15,894
THE CITY OF SEOUL ONE OF THE 

4661
09:28:15,894 --> 09:28:16,862
BIGGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD IS 

4662
09:28:16,862 --> 09:28:19,298
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BORDER.

4663
09:28:19,298 --> 09:28:21,467
>> YOU ONCE SPOKE ABOUT FIRE AND

4664
09:28:21,467 --> 09:28:21,667
FURY.

4665
09:28:21,667 --> 09:28:23,235
IS THAT NO LONGER THE CASE IF AT

4666
09:28:23,235 --> 09:28:25,404
THAT TIME WE NEEDED PERHAPS FIRE

4667
09:28:25,404 --> 09:28:26,338
AND FURY BECAUSE WE COULD NOT 

4668
09:28:26,338 --> 09:28:29,909
HAVE ALLOWED THAT KIND OF 

4669
09:28:29,909 --> 09:28:31,009
CAPABILITY FROM THE STANDPOINT 

4670
09:28:31,009 --> 09:28:33,412
OF THE UNITED STATES AND 

4671
09:28:33,412 --> 09:28:34,412
CERTAINLY JAPAN WASN'T GOING TO 

4672
09:28:34,412 --> 09:28:35,313
ALLOW IT EITHER.

4673
09:28:35,313 --> 09:28:36,381
JAPAN IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR. 

4674
09:28:36,381 --> 09:28:37,248
>> ONE MORE THING, 

4675
09:28:37,248 --> 09:28:38,484
MR. PRESIDENT, COULD YOU TELL US

4676
09:28:38,484 --> 09:28:39,985
ABOUT THE VIDEO THAT YOU SHOWED 

4677
09:28:39,985 --> 09:28:40,519
BEFORE THIS?

4678
09:28:40,519 --> 09:28:41,020
>> YEAH. 

4679
09:28:41,020 --> 09:28:42,555
>> WHEN DID YOU SHOW THAT TO 

4680
09:28:42,555 --> 09:28:42,821
KIM?

4681
09:28:42,821 --> 09:28:44,423
WHAT WAS THE GOAL THERE. 

4682
09:28:44,423 --> 09:28:45,424
>> TODAY, YEAH.

4683
09:28:45,424 --> 09:28:47,025
WE HAD IT MADE UP BY SOME -- I 

4684
09:28:47,025 --> 09:28:47,926
HOPE YOU LIKED IT.

4685
09:28:47,926 --> 09:28:48,827
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.

4686
09:28:48,827 --> 09:28:50,729
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 

4687
09:28:50,729 --> 09:28:53,832
ENOUGH TO SHOW.

4688
09:28:53,832 --> 09:28:56,168
ONE IN ENGLISH AND ONE IN KOREAN

4689
09:28:56,168 --> 09:28:59,171
AND WE HAD IT MADE UP.

4690
09:28:59,171 --> 09:29:01,006
I SHOWED IT TO HIM TODAY.

4691
09:29:01,006 --> 09:29:02,007
ACTUALLY DURING THE MEETING 

4692
09:29:02,007 --> 09:29:04,210
TOWARD THE END OF THE MEETING 

4693
09:29:04,210 --> 09:29:06,679
AND I THINK HE LOVED IT.

4694
09:29:06,679 --> 09:29:07,913
WE DIDN'T HAVE A BIG SCREEN LIKE

4695
09:29:07,913 --> 09:29:09,548
YOU HAVE THE LUXURY OF HAVING.

4696
09:29:09,548 --> 09:29:11,283
WE DIDN'T NEED IT BECAUSE WE HAD

4697
09:29:11,283 --> 09:29:16,588
IT ON A CASSETTE -- AN iPAD AND 

4698
09:29:16,588 --> 09:29:19,258
THEY PLAYED IT AND ABOUT EIGHT 

4699
09:29:19,258 --> 09:29:21,026
OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES WERE 

4700
09:29:21,026 --> 09:29:23,228
WATCHING IT AND I THOUGHT THEY 

4701
09:29:23,228 --> 09:29:23,896
WERE FASCINATED BUT I THOUGHT IT

4702
09:29:23,896 --> 09:29:24,496
WAS WELL DONE.

4703
09:29:24,496 --> 09:29:25,831
I SHOWED IT TO YOU BECAUSE 

4704
09:29:25,831 --> 09:29:26,699
THAT'S THE FUTURE.

4705
09:29:26,699 --> 09:29:28,867
THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE 

4706
09:29:28,867 --> 09:29:29,168
FUTURE.

4707
09:29:29,168 --> 09:29:30,836
AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS 

4708
09:29:30,836 --> 09:29:33,005
JUST NOT A VERY GOOD 

4709
09:29:33,005 --> 09:29:33,305
ALTERNATIVE.

4710
09:29:33,305 --> 09:29:36,541
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD BUT I SHOWED 

4711
09:29:36,541 --> 09:29:38,443
IT BECAUSE I REALLY WANT HIM TO 

4712
09:29:38,443 --> 09:29:39,011
DO SOMETHING.

4713
09:29:39,011 --> 09:29:40,846
NOW I DON'T THINK I HAD TO SHOW 

4714
09:29:40,846 --> 09:29:43,315
IT BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE HE 

4715
09:29:43,315 --> 09:29:44,449
WANTS TO -- I THINK HE WANTS TO 

4716
09:29:44,449 --> 09:29:45,918
GET IT DONE.

4717
09:29:45,918 --> 09:29:49,054
YES, GO AHEAD.

4718
09:29:49,054 --> 09:29:51,056
HOW IS STATEN ISLAND FERRY 

4719
09:29:51,056 --> 09:29:51,356
DOING, OKAY.

4720
09:29:51,356 --> 09:29:51,723
>> GOING WELL. 

4721
09:29:51,723 --> 09:29:52,958
>> HE WROTE THE BEST STORY ABOUT

4722
09:29:52,958 --> 09:29:54,660
ME WITH THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY 

4723
09:29:54,660 --> 09:29:56,161
AND AFTER THAT HE'S NEVER 

4724
09:29:56,161 --> 09:29:57,263
WRITTEN A GASH. 

4725
09:29:57,263 --> 09:29:58,097
>> THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. 

4726
09:29:58,097 --> 09:29:59,298
>> IT'S A LONG TIME AGO.

4727
09:29:59,298 --> 09:30:01,199
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S BEEN A 

4728
09:30:01,199 --> 09:30:02,934
BUSY WEEK FOR YOU ON THE 

4729
09:30:02,934 --> 09:30:03,769
INTERNATIONAL STAGE.

4730
09:30:03,769 --> 09:30:05,804
YOU'RE LEAVING THIS SUMMIT IN 

4731
09:30:05,804 --> 09:30:07,206
SINGAPORE HAVING DETERMINED THAT

4732
09:30:07,206 --> 09:30:08,540
KIM JONG-UN IS A TALENTED MAN.

4733
09:30:08,540 --> 09:30:10,609
YOU LEFT THE G7 SUMMIT A FEW 

4734
09:30:10,609 --> 09:30:12,177
DAYS AGO IN CANADA HAVING 

4735
09:30:12,177 --> 09:30:13,945
DETERMINED THAT PRIME MINISTER 

4736
09:30:13,945 --> 09:30:16,448
TRUDEAU IS WEAK AND DISHONEST.

4737
09:30:16,448 --> 09:30:18,284
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICA'S 

4738
09:30:18,284 --> 09:30:19,351
ALLIES WHO WORRY THAT YOU MIGHT 

4739
09:30:19,351 --> 09:30:22,487
BE JEOPARDIZING OUR LONG-TERM 

4740
09:30:22,487 --> 09:30:23,622
ALLIANCES AND WHO WORRY YOU 

4741
09:30:23,622 --> 09:30:26,091
MIGHT BE TREATING OUR HISTORIC 

4742
09:30:26,091 --> 09:30:34,099
FRIENDS AS AND -- AS ENEMIES AND

4743
09:30:34,099 --> 09:30:34,766
ENEMIES AS FRIENDS. 

4744
09:30:34,766 --> 09:30:36,568
>> I LEFT THE MEETING AND I'LL 

4745
09:30:36,568 --> 09:30:38,370
BE HONEST, WE ARE BEING TAKEN 

4746
09:30:38,370 --> 09:30:40,439
ADVANTAGE OF BY VIRTUALLY EVERY 

4747
09:30:40,439 --> 09:30:42,041
ONE OF THOSE COUNTRY, VERY, VERY

4748
09:30:42,041 --> 09:30:42,541
SERIOUSLY.

4749
09:30:42,541 --> 09:30:44,242
NOW, THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE 

4750
09:30:44,242 --> 09:30:46,111
OF BAD MANAGEMENT AT THE TOP, 

4751
09:30:46,111 --> 09:30:48,414
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENTS THAT 

4752
09:30:48,414 --> 09:30:49,214
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT TRADE OR 

4753
09:30:49,214 --> 09:30:50,549
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT OR WHATEVER

4754
09:30:50,549 --> 09:30:52,718
REASON, FOR MANY YEARS WITH 

4755
09:30:52,718 --> 09:30:54,252
CHINA BEING OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 

4756
09:30:54,252 --> 09:30:55,387
SUCCESSFUL AT IT BUT THE 

4757
09:30:55,387 --> 09:30:57,656
EUROPEAN UNION IS SECOND, 151 

4758
09:30:57,656 --> 09:30:59,458
BILLION WE LOST, THEY WERE 

4759
09:30:59,458 --> 09:31:01,827
REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, AND 

4760
09:31:01,827 --> 09:31:03,528
WE'RE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 

4761
09:31:03,528 --> 09:31:07,166
ON TRADE.

4762
09:31:07,166 --> 09:31:09,234
CANADA DOES HAVE VERY BIG 

4763
09:31:09,234 --> 09:31:10,569
ADVANTAGES OVER US IN TERMS OF 

4764
09:31:10,569 --> 09:31:12,071
TRADE DEFICITS.

4765
09:31:12,071 --> 09:31:14,073
WE HAVE A BIG TRADE DEFICIT WITH

4766
09:31:14,073 --> 09:31:14,306
CANADA.

4767
09:31:14,306 --> 09:31:16,608
I WAS RIDING WHERE, OH, IT'S 

4768
09:31:16,608 --> 09:31:18,377
ACTUALLY A SURPLUS.

4769
09:31:18,377 --> 09:31:20,612
IT'S EITHER 17 BUT IT COULD 

4770
09:31:20,612 --> 09:31:21,480
ACTUALLY BE 100.

4771
09:31:21,480 --> 09:31:22,981
THEY PUT OUT A DOCUMENT, I DON'T

4772
09:31:22,981 --> 09:31:24,249
KNOW IF YOU SAW IT, THEY DIDN'T 

4773
09:31:24,249 --> 09:31:27,252
WANT ME TO SEE IT BUT WE FOUND 

4774
09:31:27,252 --> 09:31:28,086
IT, PERHAPS THEY WERE TRYING TO 

4775
09:31:28,086 --> 09:31:29,188
SHOW THE POWER THEY HAVE.

4776
09:31:29,188 --> 09:31:30,989
IT'S CLOSE TO $100 BILLION A 

4777
09:31:30,989 --> 09:31:32,291
YEAR LOSS WITH CANADA.

4778
09:31:32,291 --> 09:31:34,360
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR FARM 

4779
09:31:34,360 --> 09:31:35,794
PRODUCTS, MANY OF THEM.

4780
09:31:35,794 --> 09:31:38,696
THEY CHARGE WHAT WAS 270% BUT 

4781
09:31:38,696 --> 09:31:39,865
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY 

4782
09:31:39,865 --> 09:31:41,166
THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY 

4783
09:31:41,166 --> 09:31:44,503
RAISED IT TO 295% FOR DAIRY 

4784
09:31:44,503 --> 09:31:45,971
PRODUCTS AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO

4785
09:31:45,971 --> 09:31:47,539
OUR FARMERS AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR

4786
09:31:47,539 --> 09:31:48,807
TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, 

4787
09:31:48,807 --> 09:31:51,477
THE WORKERS, THE FARMERS, THE 

4788
09:31:51,477 --> 09:31:51,744
COMPANIES.

4789
09:31:51,744 --> 09:31:53,245
AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TRADE.

4790
09:31:53,245 --> 09:31:54,513
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS BARRIERS 

4791
09:31:54,513 --> 09:31:55,414
UP.

4792
09:31:55,414 --> 09:31:56,114
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS TARIFFS SO 

4793
09:31:56,114 --> 09:31:59,050
WHEN I PUT IN A COUNTERVEILING 

4794
09:31:59,050 --> 09:32:00,752
TARIFF JUST TO GET US UP A 

4795
09:32:00,752 --> 09:32:02,287
LITTLE BIT SO THE BALANCE ISN'T 

4796
09:32:02,287 --> 09:32:03,789
SO MUCH, IT'S LIKE THIS, THEY 

4797
09:32:03,789 --> 09:32:09,995
SAID, OH, THAT IS A-- EVEN IF 

4798
09:32:09,995 --> 09:32:10,995
IT'S NOT COMPLETE WE HAVE TO 

4799
09:32:10,995 --> 09:32:11,630
HAVE BALANCE.

4800
09:32:11,630 --> 09:32:14,066
I SAY IT WITH MANY COUNTRIES, 

4801
09:32:14,066 --> 09:32:16,301
ANYWAY, WE CAME -- WE FINISHED 

4802
09:32:16,301 --> 09:32:19,104
THE MEETING REALLY EVERYBODY WAS

4803
09:32:19,104 --> 09:32:21,340
HAPPY AND I AGREED TO SIGN 

4804
09:32:21,340 --> 09:32:21,707
SOMETHING.

4805
09:32:21,707 --> 09:32:23,809
I ASKED FOR CHANGES, I DEMANDED 

4806
09:32:23,809 --> 09:32:24,877
CHANGES AND THOSE WERE MADE.

4807
09:32:24,877 --> 09:32:26,912
IN FACT, THE PICTURE WITH ANGELA

4808
09:32:26,912 --> 09:32:28,480
MERKEL WHO I GET ALONG WITH VERY

4809
09:32:28,480 --> 09:32:29,648
WELL WHERE I'M SITTING THERE 

4810
09:32:29,648 --> 09:32:31,216
LIKE THIS, THAT PICTURE WAS 

4811
09:32:31,216 --> 09:32:32,451
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE DOCK THE 

4812
09:32:32,451 --> 09:32:33,852
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THE 

4813
09:32:33,852 --> 09:32:36,188
FINAL DOCUMENT AS CHANGED BY THE

4814
09:32:36,188 --> 09:32:38,290
CHANGES THAT I REQUESTED.

4815
09:32:38,290 --> 09:32:40,492
THAT WAS A VERY FRIENDLY -- I 

4816
09:32:40,492 --> 09:32:42,060
KNOW IT DIDN'T LOOK FRIENDLY AND

4817
09:32:42,060 --> 09:32:43,662
WAS REPORTED NASTY BOTH WAYS.

4818
09:32:43,662 --> 09:32:45,097
I WAS ANGRY AT HER.

4819
09:32:45,097 --> 09:32:46,431
ACTUALLY WE WERE JUST TALKING 

4820
09:32:46,431 --> 09:32:48,733
THE WHOLE GROUP ABOUT SOMETHING 

4821
09:32:48,800 --> 09:32:50,502
UNRELATED TO EVERYTHING.

4822
09:32:50,502 --> 09:32:51,636
VERY FRIENDLY WAITING FOR THE 

4823
09:32:51,636 --> 09:32:53,205
DOCUMENT TO COME BACK SO I COULD

4824
09:32:53,205 --> 09:32:54,406
READ IT BEFORE I LEAVE.

4825
09:32:54,406 --> 09:32:56,008
ANYWAY, I LEFT AND IT WAS VERY 

4826
09:32:56,008 --> 09:32:56,275
FRIENDLY.

4827
09:32:56,275 --> 09:32:58,009
WHEN I GOT ONTO THE PLANE I 

4828
09:32:58,009 --> 09:32:58,910
THINK THAT JUSTIN PROBABLY 

4829
09:32:58,910 --> 09:33:00,512
DIDN'T KNOW THAT AIR FORCE ONE 

4830
09:33:00,512 --> 09:33:02,647
HAS ABOUT 20 TELEVISIONS AND I 

4831
09:33:02,647 --> 09:33:05,217
SEE THE TELEVISION AND HE'S 

4832
09:33:05,217 --> 09:33:06,384
GIVING A NEWS CONFERENCE ABOUT 

4833
09:33:06,384 --> 09:33:07,886
HOW HE WILL NOT BE PUSHED AROUND

4834
09:33:07,886 --> 09:33:08,754
BY THE UNITED STATES.

4835
09:33:08,754 --> 09:33:09,855
I SAY PUSH HIM AROUND.

4836
09:33:09,855 --> 09:33:11,623
WE JUST SHOOK HANDS.

4837
09:33:11,623 --> 09:33:13,859
IT WAS VERY FRIENDLY.

4838
09:33:13,859 --> 09:33:15,460
LOOK, COUNTRIES CANNOT CONTINUE 

4839
09:33:15,460 --> 09:33:17,796
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US ON 

4840
09:33:17,796 --> 09:33:17,996
TRADE.

4841
09:33:17,996 --> 09:33:19,264
THE NUMBERS ARE OUT.

4842
09:33:19,264 --> 09:33:21,666
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 

4843
09:33:21,666 --> 09:33:23,635
AND OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS BUT

4844
09:33:23,635 --> 09:33:25,503
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 

4845
09:33:25,503 --> 09:33:29,674
THIS COUNTRY HAS LOST $800 

4846
09:33:29,674 --> 09:33:31,276
BILLION ON TRADE WITH OTHER 

4847
09:33:31,276 --> 09:33:33,912
COUNTRIES, THE BIGGEST ONE BEING

4848
09:33:33,912 --> 09:33:34,480
CHINA.

4849
09:33:34,480 --> 09:33:37,549
8$800 BILLION.

4850
09:33:37,549 --> 09:33:38,851
151 BILLION WITH THE EUROPEAN 

4851
09:33:38,851 --> 09:33:39,051
UNION.

4852
09:33:39,051 --> 09:33:40,853
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR AGRICULTURAL

4853
09:33:40,853 --> 09:33:42,488
PRODUCTS BARELY.

4854
09:33:42,488 --> 09:33:43,621
THEY DON'T TAKE A LOT OF WHAT WE

4855
09:33:43,621 --> 09:33:45,457
HAVE AND YET THEY SEND MERCEDES 

4856
09:33:45,457 --> 09:33:46,758
IN TO US.

4857
09:33:46,758 --> 09:33:49,127
THEY SEND BMWs IN TO US BY THE 

4858
09:33:49,127 --> 09:33:49,495
MILLIONS.

4859
09:33:49,495 --> 09:33:50,596
IT'S VERY UNFAIR.

4860
09:33:50,596 --> 09:33:52,163
AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO OUR 

4861
09:33:52,163 --> 09:33:53,264
WORKERS AND I'M GOING TO 

4862
09:33:53,264 --> 09:33:54,766
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.

4863
09:33:54,766 --> 09:33:55,366
IT WON'T EVEN BE TOUGH, OKAY.

4864
09:33:55,366 --> 09:33:56,702
THANK YOU.

4865
09:33:56,702 --> 09:34:00,506
>> MR. PRESIDENT.

4866
09:34:00,506 --> 09:34:03,876
>> GO AHEAD.

4867
09:34:03,876 --> 09:34:15,888
GO AHEAD.

4868
09:34:15,888 --> 09:34:19,224
[ INAUDIBLE ]. 

4869
09:34:19,224 --> 09:34:20,893
>> I WOULD LIKE TO INVOLVE 

4870
09:34:20,893 --> 09:34:22,895
CONGRESS, YES, AND, NO, I HAVE A

4871
09:34:22,895 --> 09:34:23,862
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH JUSTIN 

4872
09:34:23,862 --> 09:34:24,229
TRUDEAU.

4873
09:34:24,229 --> 09:34:25,230
I REALLY DID.

4874
09:34:25,230 --> 09:34:27,032
OTHER THAN HE HAD A NEWS 

4875
09:34:27,032 --> 09:34:28,033
CONFERENCE THAT HE HAD BECAUSE 

4876
09:34:28,033 --> 09:34:30,535
HE ASSUMED I WAS IN AN AIRPLANE 

4877
09:34:30,535 --> 09:34:31,636
AND I WASN'T WATCHING.

4878
09:34:31,636 --> 09:34:32,504
HE LEARNED.

4879
09:34:32,504 --> 09:34:34,139
THAT'S GOING TO COST A LOT OF 

4880
09:34:34,139 --> 09:34:35,407
MONEY FOR THE PEOPLE OF CANADA.

4881
09:34:35,407 --> 09:34:36,408
HE LEARNED.

4882
09:34:36,408 --> 09:34:37,242
YOU CAN'T DO.

4883
09:34:37,242 --> 09:34:38,577
WE LAUGHED.

4884
09:34:38,577 --> 09:34:39,745
WE HAD A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

4885
09:34:39,745 --> 09:34:41,313
I'VE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 

4886
09:34:41,313 --> 09:34:41,646
WITH JUSTIN.

4887
09:34:41,646 --> 09:34:42,714
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP -- I 

4888
09:34:42,714 --> 09:34:44,516
HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP 

4889
09:34:44,516 --> 09:34:46,985
WITH ANGELA MERKEL BUT ON NATO 

4890
09:34:46,985 --> 09:34:48,787
WE'RE PAYING 4.2%.

4891
09:34:48,787 --> 09:34:50,822
SHE'S PAYING 1% OF A MUCH 

4892
09:34:50,822 --> 09:34:53,058
SMALLER GDP THAN WE HAVE.

4893
09:34:53,058 --> 09:34:55,560
WE'RE PAYING 4.2% ON A MUCH 

4894
09:34:55,560 --> 09:34:55,827
LARGER.

4895
09:34:55,827 --> 09:34:57,429
WE'RE PAYING FOR -- ANYONE CAN 

4896
09:34:57,429 --> 09:35:00,932
SAY FROM 60 TO 90% OF NATO AND 

4897
09:35:00,932 --> 09:35:02,234
WE'RE PROTECTING COUNTRIES OF 

4898
09:35:02,234 --> 09:35:03,701
EUROPE AND THEN ON TOP OF IT 

4899
09:35:03,701 --> 09:35:05,670
THEY KILL US ON TRADE SO YOU 

4900
09:35:05,670 --> 09:35:07,072
JUST CAN'T HAVE IT THAT WAY.

4901
09:35:07,072 --> 09:35:08,440
IT'S UNFAIR TO OUR TAXPAYERS AND

4902
09:35:08,440 --> 09:35:09,308
TO OUR PEOPLE.

4903
09:35:09,308 --> 09:35:11,143
BUT, NO, I HAVE A GOOD 

4904
09:35:11,143 --> 09:35:16,248
RELATIONSHIP WITH JUSTIN AND I 

4905
09:35:16,248 --> 09:35:16,882
HAVE

4906
09:35:16,882 --> 09:35:18,016
THINK I I HAVE A GOOD 

4907
09:35:18,016 --> 09:35:18,951
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN KIM.

4908
09:35:18,951 --> 09:35:20,418
I HOPE IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IF IT'S

4909
09:35:20,418 --> 09:35:22,187
GOOD WE'LL SOLVE A VERY BIG 

4910
09:35:22,187 --> 09:35:23,622
PROBLEM AND I THINK WE'VE GONE A

4911
09:35:23,622 --> 09:35:24,156
LONG WAY.

4912
09:35:24,156 --> 09:35:25,423
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING FOR A 

4913
09:35:25,423 --> 09:35:27,693
LITTLE WHILE?

4914
09:35:27,693 --> 09:35:28,727
I DON'T KNOW.

4915
09:35:28,727 --> 09:35:32,597
IT'S UP TO THE LEGENDARY SARAH 

4916
09:35:32,597 --> 09:35:33,031
HUCKABEE SANDERS.

4917
09:35:33,031 --> 09:35:34,833
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING, SARAH?

4918
09:35:34,833 --> 09:35:35,334
OKAY.

09:35:35,334 --> 09:35:36,101
WE'LL GO.

4920
09:35:36,101 --> 09:35:37,102
WELL, I DON'T CARE.

4921
09:35:37,102 --> 09:35:38,637
HEY, YOU KNOW, JUST MEANS WE GET

I HOPE YOU ENJOYED OUR FOOD. 

4933
09:35:55,454 --> 09:35:55,921

4935
09:35:56,388 --> 09:35:57,956
>> I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT YOU

4936
09:35:57,956 --> 09:35:59,758
DESCRIBE THIS AS A PROCESS.

4937
09:35:59,758 --> 09:36:01,660
WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP?

4938
09:36:01,660 --> 09:36:03,628
IS THERE SOME ONGOING DIALOGUE?

4939
09:36:03,628 --> 09:36:05,364

WE WANT TO GET IT DONE.

4945
09:36:17,809 --> 09:36:19,011
HE WANTS TO GET IT DONE.

4946
09:36:19,011 --> 09:36:20,512
WE'RE ALSO WORKING VERY MUCH 

4947
09:36:20,512 --> 09:36:21,680
WITH SOUTH KOREA.

4948
09:36:21,680 --> 09:36:24,249
WE'RE WORKING WITH JAPAN.

4949
09:36:24,249 --> 09:36:25,183
WE'RE WORKING WITH CHINA TO A 

4950
09:36:25,183 --> 09:36:27,752
LESSER EXTENT BUT WE'RE WORKING 

4951
09:36:27,752 --> 09:36:28,353
WITH CHINA.

4952
09:36:28,353 --> 09:36:29,921
>> YOU'RE COMING BACK TO 

4953
09:36:29,921 --> 09:36:30,221
SINGAPORE.

09:36:30,221 --> 09:36:33,892
>> I WOULD COME BACK GLADLY.

4955
09:36:33,892 --> 09:36:34,759
YOUR PRIME MINISTER WAS 

4956
09:36:34,759 --> 09:36:35,060
FANTASTIC.

4957
09:36:35,060 --> 09:36:36,294
WE WERE WITH HIM YESTERDAY.

4958
09:36:36,294 --> 09:36:37,396
HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB.

4959
09:36:37,396 --> 09:36:39,431
VERY WELCOMING.

4960
09:36:39,431 --> 09:36:40,832
PROBABLY MADE A DIFFERENCE 

4961
09:36:40,832 --> 09:36:41,099
ACTUALLY.

4962
09:36:41,099 --> 09:36:41,600
GREAT PLACE.

4963
09:36:41,600 --> 09:36:42,200
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4964
09:36:42,200 --> 09:36:44,503
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

4965
09:36:44,503 --> 09:36:45,337
>> YES, MA'AM.

4966
09:36:45,337 --> 09:36:47,506
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

4967
09:36:47,506 --> 09:36:49,741
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THAT FIRST 

4968
09:36:49,741 --> 09:36:50,508
INTERACTION WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 

4969
09:36:50,508 --> 09:36:52,177
THIS MORNING THAT MADE YOU 

4970
09:36:52,177 --> 09:36:53,712
DECIDE NOT TO WALK AWAY AFTER 

4971
09:36:53,712 --> 09:36:54,946
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD KNOW 

4972
09:36:54,946 --> 09:36:56,848
WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE IF HE 

4973
09:36:56,848 --> 09:36:57,281
WAS SINCERE. 

4974
09:36:57,281 --> 09:36:58,717
>> I'VE SAID THAT ABOUT 

4975
09:36:58,717 --> 09:36:59,584
RELATIONSHIP, I'VE SAID THAT 

4976
09:36:59,584 --> 09:36:59,917
ABOUT PEOPLE.

4977
09:36:59,917 --> 09:37:02,287
YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST SECOND, 

4978
09:37:02,287 --> 09:37:03,989
NOW, I WAS GENEROUS, I SAID FIVE

4979
09:37:03,989 --> 09:37:05,090
SECONDS, YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST 

4980
09:37:05,090 --> 09:37:08,326
SECOND IN SOME CASES, SOMETIMES 

4981
09:37:08,326 --> 09:37:10,028
THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

4982
09:37:10,028 --> 09:37:12,230
BUT SOMETIMES IT DOES.

4983
09:37:12,230 --> 09:37:13,965
FROM THE BEGINNING WE GOT ALONG 

4984
09:37:13,965 --> 09:37:15,967
BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 

4985
09:37:15,967 --> 09:37:18,236
GROUNDWORK.

4986
09:37:18,236 --> 09:37:20,939
THIS WASN'T LIKE WE JUST STARTED

4987
09:37:20,939 --> 09:37:22,841
TALKING ABOUT THESE VERY COMPLEX

4988
09:37:22,841 --> 09:37:25,944
SUBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON

4989
09:37:25,944 --> 09:37:26,545
FOR 70 YEARS.

4990
09:37:26,545 --> 09:37:30,916
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR 

4991
09:37:30,916 --> 09:37:31,149
MONTHS.

4992
09:37:31,149 --> 09:37:33,218
AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE THE RHETORIC

4993
09:37:33,218 --> 09:37:35,320
STOPPED, ONCE THEY DID A GREAT 

4994
09:37:35,320 --> 09:37:36,888
THING, YOU KNOW, NORTH KOREA DID

4995
09:37:36,888 --> 09:37:39,324
A GREAT THING BY GOING TO THE 

4996
09:37:39,324 --> 09:37:41,292
OLYMPICS, BECAUSE THE OLYMPICS 

4997
09:37:41,292 --> 09:37:43,395
AND PRESIDENT MOON WILL TELL YOU

4998
09:37:43,395 --> 09:37:45,997
THIS, THE OLYMPICS WAS NOT 

4999
09:37:45,997 --> 09:37:46,832
EXACTLY DOING GREAT.

5000
09:37:46,832 --> 09:37:49,134
PEOPLE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE BEING 

5001
09:37:49,134 --> 09:37:50,701
BOMBED OUT OF THE OPENING 

5002
09:37:50,701 --> 09:37:52,404
CEREMONIES, YOU KNOW, THEY 

5003
09:37:52,404 --> 09:37:53,772
WEREN'T EXACTLY SELLING TICKETS 

5004
09:37:53,772 --> 09:37:57,476
AND AS SOON AS -- AS SOON AS THE

5005
09:37:57,476 --> 09:37:59,911
CHAIRMAN, CHAIRMAN KIM SAID 

5006
09:37:59,911 --> 09:38:01,379
LET'S PARTICIPATE IN THE 

5007
09:38:01,379 --> 09:38:04,216
OLYMPICS, IT SOLD LIKE 

5008
09:38:04,216 --> 09:38:05,383
WILDPWILDFIRE 

5009
09:38:05,383 --> 09:38:06,685
AND WAS A GREAT SUCCESS.

5010
09:38:06,685 --> 09:38:08,052
HE DID A GREAT THING BUT SINCE 

5011
09:38:08,052 --> 09:38:09,654
THAT TIME, PRETTY MUCH SINCE 

5012
09:38:09,654 --> 09:38:13,258
THAT TIME, BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW A

5013
09:38:13,258 --> 09:38:15,494
DELEGATION CAME FROM SOUTH KOREA

5014
09:38:15,494 --> 09:38:16,895
WHO HAD JUST MET TO NORTH KOREA 

5015
09:38:16,895 --> 09:38:19,264
AND TOLD ME LOTS OF THINGS 

5016
09:38:19,264 --> 09:38:20,966
INCLUDING THE FACT THEY WOULD BE

5017
09:38:20,966 --> 09:38:21,766
WILLING TO DENUKE.

5018
09:38:21,766 --> 09:38:23,135
WE HAVE ONE OF THEIR GREAT 

5019
09:38:23,135 --> 09:38:24,402
PEOPLE HERE TODAY THAT THEY WERE

5020
09:38:24,402 --> 09:38:27,873
WILLING TO DENUKE AND ONCE THAT 

5021
09:38:27,873 --> 09:38:29,608
STARTED, WE HAVE BEEN -- WE HAVE

5022
09:38:29,608 --> 09:38:30,475
BEEN REALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT 

5023
09:38:30,475 --> 09:38:31,709
FROM THE END OF THE OLYMPICS 

5024
09:38:31,709 --> 09:38:35,980
WHEN THE WHOLE DELEGATION CAME 

5025
09:38:35,980 --> 09:38:36,614
TO SAY VARIOUS THINGS INCLUDING 

5026
09:38:36,614 --> 09:38:36,881
DENUKING. 

5027
09:38:36,881 --> 09:38:38,183
>> IF I MAY A SECOND QUESTION.

5028
09:38:38,183 --> 09:38:40,018
IN THE DOCUMENT THAT YOU SIGNED 

5029
09:38:40,018 --> 09:38:41,486
EARLIER TODAY, NORTH KOREA 

5030
09:38:41,486 --> 09:38:43,822
AGREED TO COMMIT TO 

5031
09:38:43,822 --> 09:38:44,255
DENUCLEARIZATION.

5032
09:38:44,255 --> 09:38:46,057
TO BORROW A PHRASE YOU HAVE USED

5033
09:38:46,057 --> 09:38:48,459
TO CRITICIZE YOUR PREDECESSORS 

5034
09:38:48,459 --> 09:38:50,161
AND POLITICAL OPPONENTS HOW DO 

5035
09:38:50,161 --> 09:38:52,864
YOU ENSURE THAT NORTH KOREA IS 

5036
09:38:52,864 --> 09:38:54,365
NOT ALL TALK, NO ACTION?

5037
09:38:54,365 --> 09:38:56,268
>> WELL, I THINK CAN YOU ENSURE 

5038
09:38:56,268 --> 09:38:56,535
ANYTHING?

5039
09:38:56,535 --> 09:38:57,669
CAN I ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GOING 

5040
09:38:57,669 --> 09:38:59,571
TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN PROPERLY 

5041
09:38:59,571 --> 09:39:00,338
WHEN YOU SIT DOWN?

5042
09:39:00,338 --> 09:39:01,840
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T ENSURE 

5043
09:39:01,840 --> 09:39:02,274
ANYTHING.

5044
09:39:02,274 --> 09:39:04,909
ALL I CAN SAY IS THEY WANT TO 

5045
09:39:04,909 --> 09:39:06,044
MAKE A DEAL.

5046
09:39:06,044 --> 09:39:07,012
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

5047
09:39:07,012 --> 09:39:08,547
MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN DEALS.

5048
09:39:08,547 --> 09:39:09,848
I'VE DONE GREAT AT IT.

5049
09:39:09,848 --> 09:39:11,716
AND THAT'S WHAT I DO.

5050
09:39:11,716 --> 09:39:12,917
AND I KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS 

5051
09:39:12,917 --> 09:39:14,386
TO DEAL AND I KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY

5052
09:39:14,386 --> 09:39:14,753
DOESN'T.

5053
09:39:14,753 --> 09:39:16,488
A LOT OF POLITICIANS DON'T.

5054
09:39:16,488 --> 09:39:17,789
THAT'S NOT THEIR THING BUT IT IS

5055
09:39:17,789 --> 09:39:18,290
MY THING.

5056
09:39:18,290 --> 09:39:20,325
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS REALLY COULD

5057
09:39:20,325 --> 09:39:22,561
HAVE BEEN DONE, I THINK EASIER A

5058
09:39:22,561 --> 09:39:25,096
LONG TIME AGO BUT I KNOW FOR -- 

5059
09:39:25,096 --> 09:39:28,834
I JUST FEEL VERY STRONGLY, MY 

5060
09:39:28,834 --> 09:39:29,801
INSTINCT, MY ABILITY OR TALENT 

5061
09:39:29,801 --> 09:39:31,636
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL AND 

5062
09:39:31,636 --> 09:39:38,643
MAKING A DEAL IS A GREAT THING 

5063
09:39:38,643 --> 09:39:39,210
FOR THE WORLD AND FOR CHINA.

5064
09:39:39,210 --> 09:39:39,844
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT CHINA IS 

5065
09:39:39,844 --> 09:39:40,512
HAPPY WITH SOMEBODY HAVING 

5066
09:39:40,512 --> 09:39:42,681
NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO CLOSE.

5067
09:39:42,681 --> 09:39:44,148
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S CHINA WAS 

5068
09:39:44,148 --> 09:39:45,750
VERY HELPFUL.

5069
09:39:45,750 --> 09:39:47,352
SO I THINK HE WANTS TO MAKE A 

5070
09:39:47,352 --> 09:39:47,652
DEAL.

5071
09:39:47,652 --> 09:39:49,154
CAN ANYBODY BE CERTAIN?

5072
09:39:49,154 --> 09:39:51,423
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE CERTAIN 

5073
09:39:51,423 --> 09:39:52,490
SOON BECAUSE THE NEGOTIATIONS 

5074
09:39:52,490 --> 09:39:52,757
CONTINUE.

5075
09:39:52,757 --> 09:39:52,957
OKAY.

5076
09:39:52,957 --> 09:39:56,494
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5077
09:39:56,494 --> 09:39:59,364
GO AHEAD.

5078
09:39:59,364 --> 09:40:01,566
>> YOU MENTION THAT YOU HAVE 

5079
09:40:01,566 --> 09:40:04,069
RAISED EXTENSIVELY THE ISSUE OF 

5080
09:40:04,069 --> 09:40:05,070
HUMAN RIGHTS WITH CHAIRMAN KIM.

5081
09:40:05,070 --> 09:40:06,036
I WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD SAY TO 

5082
09:40:06,036 --> 09:40:08,440
THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

5083
09:40:08,440 --> 09:40:10,041
NO ABILITY WHATSOEVER TO HEAR OR

5084
09:40:10,041 --> 09:40:11,609
TO SEE THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 

5085
09:40:11,609 --> 09:40:13,845
THE 100,000 NORTH KOREANS KEPT 

5086
09:40:13,845 --> 09:40:16,715
IN A NETWORK OF GULAGS, HAVE YOU

5087
09:40:16,715 --> 09:40:18,550
BETRAYED THEM BY LEGITIMIZING 

5088
09:40:18,550 --> 09:40:19,650
THE REGIME IN PYONGYANG?

5089
09:40:19,650 --> 09:40:21,652
>> NO, I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM 

5090
09:40:21,652 --> 09:40:22,988
BECAUSE I THINK THINGS WILL 

5091
09:40:22,988 --> 09:40:23,221
CHANGE.

5092
09:40:23,221 --> 09:40:24,689
I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM.

5093
09:40:24,689 --> 09:40:26,424
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY.

5094
09:40:26,424 --> 09:40:28,460
ALL I CAN DO IS DO WHAT I CAN 

5095
09:40:28,460 --> 09:40:28,626
DO.

5096
09:40:28,626 --> 09:40:30,728
WE HAVE TO STOP THE 

5097
09:40:30,728 --> 09:40:31,495
NUCLEARIZATION AND HAVE TO DO 

5098
09:40:31,495 --> 09:40:35,400
OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S AN 

5099
09:40:35,400 --> 09:40:36,501
IMPORTANT THING.

5100
09:40:36,501 --> 09:40:38,569
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ASK 

5101
09:40:38,569 --> 09:40:40,038
ME A MUCH MORE POSITIVE 

5102
09:40:40,038 --> 09:40:40,538
QUESTION.

5103
09:40:40,538 --> 09:40:41,806
NOT MUCH I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

5104
09:40:41,806 --> 09:40:43,441
AT A CERTAIN POINT I REALLY 

5105
09:40:43,441 --> 09:40:44,275
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO DO THINGS 

5106
09:40:44,275 --> 09:40:45,176
ABOUT IT.

5107
09:40:45,176 --> 09:40:47,011
I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE 

5108
09:40:47,011 --> 09:40:48,280
GREAT WINNERS TODAY.

5109
09:40:48,280 --> 09:40:49,414
THAT LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT 

5110
09:40:49,414 --> 09:40:49,981
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

5111
09:40:49,981 --> 09:40:51,182
I THINK ULTIMATELY THEY ARE 

5112
09:40:51,182 --> 09:40:52,550
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT 

5113
09:40:52,550 --> 09:40:53,518
WINNERS AS A GROUP.

5114
09:40:53,518 --> 09:40:54,085
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD.

5115
09:40:54,085 --> 09:40:56,488
GO AHEAD.

5116
09:40:56,488 --> 09:40:58,823
YEAH.

5117
09:40:58,823 --> 09:41:00,858
>> WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER 

5118
09:41:00,858 --> 09:41:02,894
REMOVING THE SANCTIONS WITHOUT 

5119
09:41:02,894 --> 09:41:03,628
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE 

5120
09:41:03,628 --> 09:41:04,696
HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION?

5121
09:41:04,696 --> 09:41:07,198
>> NO, I WANT SIGNIFICANT 

5122
09:41:07,198 --> 09:41:07,498
IMPROVEMENT.

5123
09:41:07,498 --> 09:41:09,600
I WANT TO KNOW IT WON'T BE 

5124
09:41:09,600 --> 09:41:10,735
HAPPENING AND, AGAIN, ONCE YOU 

5125
09:41:10,735 --> 09:41:12,470
START THAT PROCESS, THERE WILL 

5126
09:41:12,470 --> 09:41:13,738
BE A POINT AT WHICH EVEN THOUGH 

5127
09:41:13,738 --> 09:41:15,573
YOU WON'T BE FINISHED FOR AWHILE

5128
09:41:15,573 --> 09:41:17,208
BECAUSE IT CAN'T HAPPEN 

5129
09:41:17,208 --> 09:41:18,076
SCIENTIFICALLY OR MECHANICALLY 

5130
09:41:18,076 --> 09:41:19,411
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE 

5131
09:41:19,411 --> 09:41:20,245
TO GO BACK.

5132
09:41:20,245 --> 09:41:21,512
ONCE WE REACH THAT POINT I'LL 

5133
09:41:21,512 --> 09:41:22,914
START TO GIVE THAT VERY SERIOUS 

5134
09:41:22,914 --> 09:41:23,147
THOUGHT.

5135
09:41:23,147 --> 09:41:25,483
YES, GO AHEAD.

5136
09:41:25,483 --> 09:41:26,217
GO AHEAD.

5137
09:41:26,217 --> 09:41:26,651
YOU FIRST.

5138
09:41:26,651 --> 09:41:28,486
>> MR. PRESIDENT, DID YOU ALSO 

5139
09:41:28,486 --> 09:41:31,923
DISCUSS THE COST OF 

5140
09:41:31,923 --> 09:41:32,557
DENUCLEARIZATION AND HOW ARE 

5141
09:41:32,557 --> 09:41:34,259
THEY GOING TO FOOT THE BILL WITH

5142
09:41:34,259 --> 09:41:36,527
THE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS 

5143
09:41:36,527 --> 09:41:37,095
REMAINING IN PLACE. 

5144
09:41:37,095 --> 09:41:38,363
>> I THINK SOUTH KOREA AND I 

5145
09:41:38,363 --> 09:41:40,031
THINK THAT JAPAN WILL HELP THEM 

5146
09:41:40,031 --> 09:41:40,532
VERY GREATLY.

5147
09:41:40,532 --> 09:41:42,600
I THINK THEY'RE PREPARED TO HELP

5148
09:41:42,600 --> 09:41:42,800
THEM.

5149
09:41:42,800 --> 09:41:43,768
THEY ANOTHER THEY'RE GOING TO 

5150
09:41:43,768 --> 09:41:45,337
HAVE TO HELP THEM.

5151
09:41:45,337 --> 09:41:47,072
I THINK THEY WILL HELP THEM VERY

5152
09:41:47,072 --> 09:41:47,305
GREATLY.

5153
09:41:47,305 --> 09:41:49,040
WE WON'T HAVE TO HAPPEN THEM.

5154
09:41:49,040 --> 09:41:49,941
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN 

5155
09:41:49,941 --> 09:41:52,243
PAYING A BIG PRICE AT A LOT 

5156
09:41:52,243 --> 09:41:54,346
DIFFERENT PLACES BUT SOUTH KOREA

5157
09:41:54,346 --> 09:41:57,282
WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS RIGHT NEXT 

5158
09:41:57,282 --> 09:41:57,949
DOOR IN JAPAN WHICH ESSENTIALLY 

5159
09:41:57,949 --> 09:41:58,783
IS NEXT DOOR, THEY'RE GOING TO 

5160
09:41:58,783 --> 09:42:00,351
BE HELPING THEM AND I THINK 

5161
09:42:00,351 --> 09:42:03,120
THEY'LL BE DOING A VERY GENEROUS

5162
09:42:03,120 --> 09:42:04,823
JOB AND A TERRIFIC JOB SO THEY 

5163
09:42:04,823 --> 09:42:06,124
WILL BE HELPING THEM.

5164
09:42:06,124 --> 09:42:08,626
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD.

5165
09:42:08,626 --> 09:42:08,826
YES.

5166
09:42:08,826 --> 09:42:09,794
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

5167
09:42:09,794 --> 09:42:10,428
>> THANK YOU.

5168
09:42:10,428 --> 09:42:12,497
>> I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON 

5169
09:42:12,497 --> 09:42:13,098
STEVE'S QUESTION.

5170
09:42:13,098 --> 09:42:14,632
HE ASKED YOU HOW LONG IT WOULD 

5171
09:42:14,632 --> 09:42:17,135
TAKE TO DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN 

5172
09:42:17,135 --> 09:42:17,402
PENINSULA.

5173
09:42:17,402 --> 09:42:19,471
YOU SAID A LONG TIME.

5174
09:42:19,471 --> 09:42:20,905
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

5175
09:42:20,905 --> 09:42:22,707
>> WHEN YOU SAY A LONG TIME I 

5176
09:42:22,707 --> 09:42:24,275
THINK WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS 

5177
09:42:24,275 --> 09:42:26,711
WE CAN DO IT SCIENTIFICALLY AS 

5178
09:42:26,711 --> 09:42:28,246
FAST IT CAN BE DONE 

5179
09:42:28,246 --> 09:42:28,579
MECHANICALLY.

5180
09:42:28,579 --> 09:42:30,214
I DON'T THINK -- I'VE READ 

5181
09:42:30,214 --> 09:42:33,184
HORROR STORIES, IT'S A 15-YEAR 

5182
09:42:33,184 --> 09:42:35,586
PROCESS ASSUMING YOU WANTED TO 

5183
09:42:35,586 --> 09:42:37,755
DO IT QUICKLY, I THINK WHOEVER 

5184
09:42:37,755 --> 09:42:39,190
WROTE THAT IS WRONG BUT THERE 

5185
09:42:39,190 --> 09:42:41,893
WILL BE A POINT AT WHICH WHEN 

5186
09:42:41,893 --> 09:42:45,864
YOU'RE 20% THROUGH YOU CAN'T GO 

5187
09:42:45,864 --> 09:42:46,064
BACK. 

5188
09:42:46,064 --> 09:42:46,831
>> HOW LONG -- 

5189
09:42:46,831 --> 09:42:50,602
>> I HAD AN UNCLE A GREAT 

5190
09:42:50,602 --> 09:42:51,970
PROFESSOR FOR I BELIEVE 40 YEARS

5191
09:42:51,970 --> 09:42:53,104
AT MIT AND USED TO DISCUSS 

5192
09:42:53,104 --> 09:42:55,306
NUCLEAR WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.

5193
09:42:55,306 --> 09:42:56,408
HE WAS A GREAT EXPERT.

5194
09:42:56,408 --> 09:42:59,110
HE WAS A GREAT, BRILLIANT JEAN 

5195
09:42:59,110 --> 09:43:00,245
DR. JOHN TRUMP AT MIT.

5196
09:43:00,245 --> 09:43:01,879
I THINK HE WAS THERE 40 YEARS, I

5197
09:43:01,879 --> 09:43:02,380
WAS TOLD.

5198
09:43:02,380 --> 09:43:04,249
IN FACT, THE HEAD OF MIT SENT ME

5199
09:43:04,249 --> 09:43:06,117
A BOOK ON MY UNCLE BUT WE USED 

5200
09:43:06,117 --> 09:43:07,652
TO TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR -- TALKING

5201
09:43:07,652 --> 09:43:10,187
ABOUT A VERY COMPLEX SUBJECT.

5202
09:43:10,187 --> 09:43:12,190
IT'S NOT JUST LIKE, OH, GEE, 

5203
09:43:12,190 --> 09:43:13,858
LET'S GET RID OF THE NUKES.

5204
09:43:13,858 --> 09:43:15,359
IT TAKES A PERIOD OF TIME BUT 

5205
09:43:15,359 --> 09:43:16,761
THE MAIN PERIOD OF TIME THAT I'M

5206
09:43:16,761 --> 09:43:18,129
TALKING IS THAT FIRST PERIOD 

5207
09:43:18,129 --> 09:43:19,764
WHEN YOU HIT A CERTAIN POINT, 

5208
09:43:19,764 --> 09:43:20,799
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.

5209
09:43:20,799 --> 09:43:22,100
IT'S VERY HARD TO GO BACK.

5210
09:43:22,100 --> 09:43:23,067
>> HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?

5211
09:43:23,067 --> 09:43:24,502
>> WE DON'T KNOW BUT IT'LL GO 

5212
09:43:24,502 --> 09:43:28,206
PRETTY QUICKLY.

5213
09:43:28,206 --> 09:43:28,473
GO AHEAD.

5214
09:43:28,473 --> 09:43:29,040
SURE.

5215
09:43:29,040 --> 09:43:30,174
>> THANKS, MR. PRESIDENT.

5216
09:43:30,174 --> 09:43:32,510
I WANTED TO ASK YOU AGAIN ON THE

5217
09:43:32,510 --> 09:43:33,945
SANCTIONS CAMPAIGN.

5218
09:43:33,945 --> 09:43:34,779
YOU ALLUDED AT THE VERY 

5219
09:43:34,779 --> 09:43:36,180
BEGINNING THAT THE CHINESE ARE 

5220
09:43:36,180 --> 09:43:38,116
NOT DOING AS GREAT A JOB 

5221
09:43:38,116 --> 09:43:39,484
SECURING THE BORDER AS THEY WERE

5222
09:43:39,484 --> 09:43:39,984
BEFORE.

5223
09:43:39,984 --> 09:43:41,586
YOU EXPRESSED, YOU KNOW, SOME 

5224
09:43:41,586 --> 09:43:43,087
DOUBTS WHEN KIM WENT TO SEE 

5225
09:43:43,087 --> 09:43:44,289
PRESIDENT XI.

5226
09:43:44,289 --> 09:43:45,657
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WAS

5227
09:43:45,657 --> 09:43:48,226
IN PYONGYANG AND SAID THERE 

5228
09:43:48,226 --> 09:43:50,161
SHOULDN'T BE ANY SANCTIONS WHILE

5229
09:43:50,161 --> 09:43:51,529
THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDER WAY

5230
09:43:51,529 --> 09:43:53,030
AND THE SOUTH KOREANS ARE NOW 

5231
09:43:53,030 --> 09:43:54,199
TALKING ABOUT RESTORING SOME 

5232
09:43:54,199 --> 09:43:55,600
FORM OF TRADE.

5233
09:43:55,600 --> 09:43:58,369
SO WITH ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS 

5234
09:43:58,369 --> 09:44:01,906
APPEARING TO BE MOVING TOWARD 

5235
09:44:01,906 --> 09:44:03,241
ERODING SANCTIONS, HOW CAN YOU 

5236
09:44:03,241 --> 09:44:05,143
KEEP THE SANCTIONS REGIME IN 

5237
09:44:05,143 --> 09:44:05,343
PLACE?

5238
09:44:05,343 --> 09:44:06,911
WHAT LEVERAGE DO YOU HAVE ON 

5239
09:44:06,911 --> 09:44:07,378
THESE COUNTRYS?

5240
09:44:07,378 --> 09:44:08,880
>> I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF 

5241
09:44:08,880 --> 09:44:09,414
LEVERAGE.

5242
09:44:09,414 --> 09:44:10,815
I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 

5243
09:44:10,815 --> 09:44:11,082
LEVERAGE.

5244
09:44:11,082 --> 09:44:13,885
I DO BELIEVE THAT CHINA DESPITE 

5245
09:44:13,885 --> 09:44:16,287
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 

5246
09:44:16,287 --> 09:44:18,956
XI, A MAN I TOLD YOU I HAVE 

5247
09:44:18,956 --> 09:44:20,492
GREAT RESPECT FOR AND LIKE A 

5248
09:44:20,492 --> 09:44:22,494
LOT, WE'RE HAVING TOUGH TALKS ON

5249
09:44:22,494 --> 09:44:22,760
TRADE.

5250
09:44:22,760 --> 09:44:24,562
AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY 

5251
09:44:24,562 --> 09:44:25,196
AFFECTS CHINA SOMEWHAT BUT I 

5252
09:44:25,196 --> 09:44:27,432
HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

5253
09:44:27,432 --> 09:44:29,066
AND I THINK OVER THE LAST TWO 

5254
09:44:29,066 --> 09:44:30,501
MONTHS THE BORDER IS MORE OPEN 

5255
09:44:30,501 --> 09:44:33,004
THAN IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST 

5256
09:44:33,004 --> 09:44:33,237
STARTED.

5257
09:44:33,237 --> 09:44:38,643
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS.

5258
09:44:38,643 --> 09:44:41,613
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS

5259
09:44:41,613 --> 09:44:42,647
DEFICIT IN TRADE.

5260
09:44:42,647 --> 09:44:43,948
COMMONLY KNOWN AS A TRADE 

5261
09:44:43,948 --> 09:44:44,516
DEFICIT.

5262
09:44:44,516 --> 09:44:46,517
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS DEFICIT IN 

5263
09:44:46,517 --> 09:44:47,352
TRADE WITH CHINA.

5264
09:44:47,352 --> 09:44:48,486
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 

5265
09:44:48,486 --> 09:44:48,753
IT.

5266
09:44:48,753 --> 09:44:50,688
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO LET THAT 

5267
09:44:50,688 --> 09:44:50,921
HAPPEN.

5268
09:44:50,921 --> 09:44:54,358
AND I THINK THAT HAS HAD AN 

5269
09:44:54,358 --> 09:44:56,093
IMPACT ON MY RELATIONSHIP IN 

5270
09:44:56,093 --> 09:44:57,462
TERMS OF THE BORDER.

5271
09:44:57,462 --> 09:45:02,833
I DON'T THINK IF -- I DON'T 

5272
09:45:02,833 --> 09:45:04,802
THINK IT AFFECTS MY FEELING ON 

5273
09:45:04,802 --> 09:45:06,504
PRESIDENT XI BUT WHEN WE FIRST 

5274
09:45:06,504 --> 09:45:08,806
STARTED WE WEREN'T READY TO GO 

5275
09:45:08,806 --> 09:45:11,576
THAT ROUTE AND AS WE STARTED 

5276
09:45:11,576 --> 09:45:12,743
PREPARING AND GETTING READY TO 

5277
09:45:12,743 --> 09:45:15,580
DO THAT, I THINK THAT'S HAD AN 

5278
09:45:15,580 --> 09:45:16,947
IMPACT ON FRANKLY THE BORDER.

5279
09:45:16,947 --> 09:45:18,049
WHICH IS A SHAME BUT I HAVE TO 

5280
09:45:18,049 --> 09:45:18,917
DO IT.

5281
09:45:18,917 --> 09:45:20,018
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

5282
09:45:20,018 --> 09:45:22,086
FOR OUR COUNTRY I HAVE TO DO IT.

5283
09:45:22,086 --> 09:45:23,555
SOUTH KOREA WILL DO WHATEVER IS 

5284
09:45:23,555 --> 09:45:24,789
NECESSARY TO GET A DEAL DONE.

5285
09:45:24,789 --> 09:45:26,591
IF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T TRADE 

5286
09:45:26,591 --> 09:45:28,893
THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRADE.

5287
09:45:28,893 --> 09:45:29,694
THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO 

5288
09:45:29,694 --> 09:45:29,894
TRADE.

5289
09:45:29,894 --> 09:45:31,696
IF THEY THINK AND THEY WOULD DO 

5290
09:45:31,696 --> 09:45:33,597
THIS WITH OUR CONCURRENCE.

5291
09:45:33,597 --> 09:45:35,299
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN DO SOME 

5292
09:45:35,299 --> 09:45:37,201
WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY FAR 

5293
09:45:37,201 --> 09:45:38,236
DOWN THE LINE WE'RE FAR.

5294
09:45:38,236 --> 09:45:40,505
THAT DOCUMENT WHEN YOU READ IT 

5295
09:45:40,505 --> 09:45:43,408
TODAY, THAT'S FAR DOWN THE LINE.

5296
09:45:43,408 --> 09:45:45,076
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST 

5297
09:45:45,076 --> 09:45:46,211
HAPPENED TO BE PUT TOGETHER.

5298
09:45:46,211 --> 09:45:48,846
THIS WAS DONE OVER MONTHS AND, 

5299
09:45:48,846 --> 09:45:50,014
AGAIN, THE RHETORIC WAS 

5300
09:45:50,014 --> 09:45:51,249
IMPORTANT AND THE SANCTIONS WERE

5301
09:45:51,249 --> 09:45:51,516
IMPORTANT.

5302
09:45:51,516 --> 09:45:54,118
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE WAS 

5303
09:45:54,118 --> 09:45:55,286
MORE IMPORTANT.

5304
09:45:55,286 --> 09:45:55,920
THEY WERE BOTH IMPORTANT.

5305
09:45:55,920 --> 09:46:00,291
GO AHEAD.

5306
09:46:00,291 --> 09:46:01,659
>> MR. PRESIDENT, DAVID SANGER 

5307
09:46:01,659 --> 09:46:02,594
FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES."

5308
09:46:02,594 --> 09:46:04,028
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD 

5309
09:46:04,028 --> 09:46:05,963
GIVE US SOME SENSE OF WHETHER 

5310
09:46:05,963 --> 09:46:07,765
THE CHAIRMAN KIM TOLD YOU HOW 

5311
09:46:07,765 --> 09:46:10,034
MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS HE BELIEVES

5312
09:46:10,034 --> 09:46:11,435
HE'S MADE, WHETHER HE'S WILLING 

5313
09:46:11,435 --> 09:46:13,904
TO TURN THOSE OVER FIRST AND 

5314
09:46:13,904 --> 09:46:16,107
THEN WHETHER IN YOUR MIND YOU 

5315
09:46:16,107 --> 09:46:19,344
NEED TO DO MORE THAN WAS DONE IN

5316
09:46:19,344 --> 09:46:24,515
THE IRAN DEAL FOR ACTUALLY 

5317
09:46:24,515 --> 09:46:25,115
DISMANTLING THE -- BOTH THE 

5318
09:46:25,115 --> 09:46:27,118
URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM PROCESSES 

5319
09:46:27,118 --> 09:46:29,120
AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD A 

5320
09:46:29,120 --> 09:46:30,855
SENSE THAT CHAIRMAN KIM REALLY 

5321
09:46:30,855 --> 09:46:32,290
UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT INVOLVES 

5322
09:46:32,290 --> 09:46:34,492
AND HAD A TIMETABLE IN HIS OWN 

5323
09:46:34,492 --> 09:46:36,060
MIND OF SHUTTING THAT.

5324
09:46:36,060 --> 09:46:38,496
>> WELL, DAVID, I CAN TELL YOU 

5325
09:46:38,496 --> 09:46:39,831
HE UNDERSTANDS.

5326
09:46:39,831 --> 09:46:41,833
HE UNDERSTANDS IT SO WELL.

5327
09:46:41,833 --> 09:46:43,267
HE UNDERSTANDS IT BETTER THAN 

5328
09:46:43,267 --> 09:46:44,635
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE 

5329
09:46:44,635 --> 09:46:45,637
WORK FOR HIM.

5330
09:46:45,637 --> 09:46:47,639
THAT IS AN EASY ONE.

5331
09:46:47,639 --> 09:46:50,408
AS FAR AS WHAT HE HAS, IT'S 

5332
09:46:50,408 --> 09:46:51,509
SUBSTANTIAL.

5333
09:46:51,509 --> 09:46:51,942
VERY SUBSTANTIAL.

5334
09:46:51,942 --> 09:46:53,811
THE TIMING WILL GO QUICKLY.

5335
09:46:53,811 --> 09:46:56,347
I BELIEVE YOU'LL SEE SOME GOOD 

5336
09:46:56,347 --> 09:46:56,580
ACTION.

5337
09:46:56,580 --> 09:46:58,916
I MEAN, AS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE

5338
09:46:58,916 --> 09:47:00,384
THINGS WITH THE MISSILE SET, I 

5339
09:47:00,384 --> 09:47:02,153
THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY SURPRISED 

5340
09:47:02,153 --> 09:47:05,022
TO HEAR, THE MISSILE SITE.

5341
09:47:05,022 --> 09:47:07,325
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE, DAVID, 

5342
09:47:07,325 --> 09:47:08,526
IT'S GOING TO GO VERY QUICKLY.

5343
09:47:08,526 --> 09:47:10,228
I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO 

5344
09:47:10,228 --> 09:47:12,029
GO FAST AND IT IS A VERY 

5345
09:47:12,029 --> 09:47:13,131
SUBSTANTIAL ARSENAL.

5346
09:47:13,131 --> 09:47:13,765
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

5347
09:47:13,765 --> 09:47:16,867
YOU KNOW, I USED TO SAY MAYBE 

5348
09:47:16,867 --> 09:47:20,371
IT'S ALL TALK AND NO ACTION.

5349
09:47:20,371 --> 09:47:22,606
BUT WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD 

5350
09:47:22,606 --> 09:47:24,375
INTELLIGENCE INTO THAT ALTHOUGH 

5351
09:47:24,375 --> 09:47:25,810
PROBABLY LESS THERE THAN ANY 

5352
09:47:25,810 --> 09:47:28,212
OTHER COUNTRY.

5353
09:47:28,212 --> 09:47:32,250
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE BETTER

5354
09:47:32,250 --> 09:47:34,052
THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE ROOM.

5355
09:47:34,052 --> 09:47:35,219
WE HAVE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT THEY

5356
09:47:35,219 --> 09:47:36,054
HAVE IS SUBSTANTIAL.

5357
09:47:36,054 --> 09:47:38,122
THIS IS WHY, DAVID, I ALWAYS SAY

5358
09:47:38,122 --> 09:47:39,890
THIS SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN PLACE 

5359
09:47:39,890 --> 09:47:42,026
SO LATE INTO THE PROCESS.

5360
09:47:42,026 --> 09:47:42,827
WOULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN BETTER 

5361
09:47:42,827 --> 09:47:44,362
IF IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO OR 20 

5362
09:47:44,362 --> 09:47:46,396
YEARS AGO OR 15 YEARS AGO WHEN 

5363
09:47:46,396 --> 09:47:48,532
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 

5364
09:47:48,532 --> 09:47:49,734
NOT HAVING A SUCCESSFUL MEETING 

5365
09:47:49,734 --> 09:47:52,770
LIKE TODAY.

5366
09:47:52,770 --> 09:47:55,907
I STILL LOVE MY FIRST INTERVIEW 

5367
09:47:55,907 --> 09:47:56,274
WITH YOU, DAVID.

5368
09:47:56,274 --> 09:47:57,575
I STILL HAVE THAT INTERVIEW 

5369
09:47:57,575 --> 09:47:57,842
ACTUALLY.

5370
09:47:57,842 --> 09:47:58,543
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

5371
09:47:58,543 --> 09:48:04,315
>> THANK YOU.

5372
09:48:04,315 --> 09:48:05,550
>> THANK YOU.

5373
09:48:05,550 --> 09:48:08,419
>> MY QUESTION IS IF THERE IS A 

5374
09:48:08,419 --> 09:48:09,354
SECOND SUMMIT -- THAT'S OKAY.

5375
09:48:09,354 --> 09:48:12,957
IF THERE IS A SECOND SUMMIT WITH

5376
09:48:12,957 --> 09:48:13,891
CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN WILL IT BE 

5377
09:48:13,891 --> 09:48:15,493
IN PYONGYANG OR WASHINGTON?

5378
09:48:15,493 --> 09:48:18,629
>> WE HAVEN'T SET THAT UP.

5379
09:48:18,629 --> 09:48:19,931
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER 

5380
09:48:19,931 --> 09:48:20,298
SUMMIT.

5381
09:48:20,298 --> 09:48:21,532
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED OR MEETING.

5382
09:48:21,532 --> 09:48:23,768
WE CAN USE A DIFFERENT TERM.

5383
09:48:23,768 --> 09:48:25,403
BUT WE'LL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER 

5384
09:48:25,403 --> 09:48:25,603
ONE.

5385
09:48:25,603 --> 09:48:26,871
I WILL SAY THIS, WE'RE MUCH 

5386
09:48:26,871 --> 09:48:28,239
FURTHER ALONG THAN I WOULD HAVE 

5387
09:48:28,239 --> 09:48:28,472
THOUGHT.

5388
09:48:28,472 --> 09:48:30,742
I DID NOT THINK WE'D BE HERE.

5389
09:48:30,742 --> 09:48:31,909
I TOLD PEOPLE.

5390
09:48:31,909 --> 09:48:32,976
I DIDN'T WANT TO BUILD PEOPLE'S 

5391
09:48:32,976 --> 09:48:33,945
HOPES UP TOO MUCH.

5392
09:48:33,945 --> 09:48:34,746
I TOLD PEOPLE I THOUGHT THIS 

5393
09:48:34,746 --> 09:48:36,314
WOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL MEETING IF

5394
09:48:36,314 --> 09:48:37,615
WE GOT ALONG.

5395
09:48:37,615 --> 09:48:39,750
WE DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP AND 

5396
09:48:39,750 --> 09:48:41,252
WE COULD HAVE MAYBE GOTTEN TO 

5397
09:48:41,252 --> 09:48:43,054
THIS POINT IN THREE OR FOUR 

5398
09:48:43,054 --> 09:48:43,421
MONTHS FROM NOW.

5399
09:48:43,421 --> 09:48:45,189
BUT IT REALLY HAPPENED VERY 

5400
09:48:45,189 --> 09:48:45,422
QUICKLY.

5401
09:48:45,422 --> 09:48:46,958
A LOT OF THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE

5402
09:48:46,958 --> 09:48:48,592
FOUNDATION THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, 

5403
09:48:48,592 --> 09:48:51,262
PUT DOWN BEFORE WE MET.

5404
09:48:51,262 --> 09:48:53,431
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED VERY 

5405
09:48:53,431 --> 09:48:53,631
FAST.

5406
09:48:53,631 --> 09:48:56,467
WE DIDN'T HAVE AS AN EXAMPLE 

5407
09:48:56,467 --> 09:48:58,702
BRINGING BACK THE REMAINS, THAT 

5408
09:48:58,702 --> 09:49:00,571
WAS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS ON OUR

5409
09:49:00,571 --> 09:49:01,005
AGENDA TODAY.

5410
09:49:01,005 --> 09:49:03,007
I BROUGHT IT UP AT THE VERY END 

5411
09:49:03,007 --> 09:49:03,875
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE TALKED TO

5412
09:49:03,875 --> 09:49:05,342
ME ABOUT IT AND I BROUGHT IT UP 

5413
09:49:05,342 --> 09:49:08,779
AT THE VERY END AND HE WAS 

5414
09:49:08,779 --> 09:49:10,281
REALLY VERY GRACIOUS AND INSTEAD

5415
09:49:10,281 --> 09:49:11,348
OF SAYING LET'S TALK ABOUT IT 

5416
09:49:11,348 --> 09:49:14,085
THE NEXT TIME, HE SAID IT MAKES 

5417
09:49:14,085 --> 09:49:14,285
SENSE.

5418
09:49:14,285 --> 09:49:15,253
WE WILL DO IT.

5419
09:49:15,253 --> 09:49:17,855
HE KNEW -- THEY KNOW WHERE MANY 

5420
09:49:17,855 --> 09:49:19,423
OF THOSE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE.

5421
09:49:19,423 --> 09:49:21,626
WHERE THEY'RE BURIED ALONG 

5422
09:49:21,626 --> 09:49:24,061
ROADS, ALONG HIGHWAYS, ALONG 

5423
09:49:24,061 --> 09:49:27,331
PATHS, USUALLY, BECAUSE OUR 

5424
09:49:27,331 --> 09:49:28,299
SOLDIERS WERE MOVING BACK AND 

5425
09:49:28,299 --> 09:49:30,234
FORTH AND HAD TO MOVE RAPIDLY.

5426
09:49:30,234 --> 09:49:30,902
IT'S VERY SAD.

5427
09:49:30,902 --> 09:49:33,271
BUT HE KNEW AND THAT WAS BROUGHT

5428
09:49:33,271 --> 09:49:36,507
UP AT THE VERY END AND, YOU 

5429
09:49:36,507 --> 09:49:37,575
KNOW, REALLY GREAT THAT HE WAS 

5430
09:49:37,575 --> 09:49:38,176
ABLE TO DO IT.

5431
09:49:38,176 --> 09:49:39,109

>> NOW I WILL PROBABLY GET THIS 

5448
09:50:02,466 --> 09:50:03,634
KILLER QUESTION. 

5449
09:50:03,634 --> 09:50:06,103
>> SPECIFICALLY THE PEOPLE -- 

5450
09:50:06,103 --> 09:50:06,838
KIM JONG-UN IS SAYING HE'S 

5451
09:50:06,838 --> 09:50:08,539
WANTING A BRIGHTER FUTURE WITH 

5452
09:50:08,539 --> 09:50:10,041
PROSPERITY FOR HIS PEOPLE YET WE

5453
09:50:10,041 --> 09:50:11,642
KNOW THEY LIVED UNDER 

5454
09:50:11,642 --> 09:50:11,942
OPPRESSION.

5455
09:50:11,942 --> 09:50:12,977
YOU SHOWED HIM THIS VIDEO OF 

5456
09:50:12,977 --> 09:50:14,846
WHAT THE FUTURE COULD BE LIKE.

5457
09:50:14,846 --> 09:50:17,148
BUT DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA 

5458
09:50:17,148 --> 09:50:19,250
SPECIFICALLY OF THE MODEL THAT 

5459
09:50:19,250 --> 09:50:22,320
HE WOULD LIKE TO GO TOWARDS?

5460
09:50:22,320 --> 09:50:23,854
ECONOMICALLY IS HE OPEN TO MORE 

5461
09:50:23,854 --> 09:50:24,454
ECONOMIC FREEDOM. 

5462
09:50:24,454 --> 09:50:25,623
>> A GOOD QUESTION.

5463
09:50:25,623 --> 09:50:28,392
SO YOU SAW A TAPE TODAY AND I 

5464
09:50:28,392 --> 09:50:29,793
THINK WAS DONE REALLY WELL BUT 

5465
09:50:29,793 --> 09:50:31,095
THAT WAS DONE AT THE HIGHEST 

5466
09:50:31,095 --> 09:50:33,964
LEVEL OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

5467
09:50:33,964 --> 09:50:35,666
I TOLD HIM, YOU MAY NOT WANT 

5468
09:50:35,666 --> 09:50:35,866
THIS.

5469
09:50:35,866 --> 09:50:37,268
YOU MAY WANT TO DO A MUCH 

5470
09:50:37,268 --> 09:50:37,969
SMALLER VERSION OF THIS.

5471
09:50:37,969 --> 09:50:39,169
I MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO DO 

5472
09:50:39,169 --> 09:50:40,771
SOMETHING BUT YOU MAY WANT TO DO

5473
09:50:40,771 --> 09:50:41,472
A SMALLER VERSION.

5474
09:50:41,472 --> 09:50:43,774
YOU MAY NOT WANT THAT WITH THE 

5475
09:50:43,774 --> 09:50:46,210
TRAINS AND EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW,

5476
09:50:46,210 --> 09:50:48,279
SUPER EVERYTHING AT THE TOP.

5477
09:50:48,279 --> 09:50:49,613
AND MAYBE YOU WON'T WANT THAT.

5478
09:50:49,613 --> 09:50:51,315
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM.

5479
09:50:51,315 --> 09:50:52,817
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM AND 

5480
09:50:52,817 --> 09:50:54,585
UP TO THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.

5481
09:50:54,585 --> 09:50:55,520
THEY MAY NOT WANT THAT.

5482
09:50:55,520 --> 09:50:57,355
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT TOO BUT 

5483
09:50:57,355 --> 09:50:58,689
THAT WAS A VERSION OF WHAT COULD

5484
09:50:58,689 --> 09:51:00,758
HAPPEN, WHAT COULD TAKE PLACE.

5485
09:51:00,758 --> 09:51:02,693
AS AN EXAMPLE THEY HAVE GREAT 

5486
09:51:02,693 --> 09:51:03,294
BEACHES.

5487
09:51:03,294 --> 09:51:04,428
YOU SEE THAT WHENEVER THEY'RE 

5488
09:51:04,428 --> 09:51:05,930
EXPLODING THEIR CANNONS INTO THE

5489
09:51:05,930 --> 09:51:06,631
OCEAN, RIGHT.

5490
09:51:06,631 --> 09:51:08,566
I SAID, BOY, LOOK AT THAT.

5491
09:51:08,566 --> 09:51:10,368
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE A GREAT 

5492
09:51:10,368 --> 09:51:10,902
CONDO.

5493
09:51:10,902 --> 09:51:11,369
[ LAUGHTER ]

5494
09:51:11,369 --> 09:51:12,236
I EXPLAINED INSTEAD OF DOING 

5495
09:51:12,236 --> 09:51:13,437
THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE BEST 

5496
09:51:13,437 --> 09:51:15,273
HOTELS IN THE WORLD RIGHT THERE.

5497
09:51:15,273 --> 09:51:17,942
THINK OF IT FROM A REAL ESTATE 

5498
09:51:17,942 --> 09:51:18,409
PERSPECTIVE.

5499
09:51:18,409 --> 09:51:19,710
SOUTH KOREA, YOU HAVE CHINA AND 

5500
09:51:19,710 --> 09:51:21,312
THEY OWN THE LAND IN THE MIDDLE.

5501
09:51:21,312 --> 09:51:22,914
HOW BAD IS THAT?

5502
09:51:22,914 --> 09:51:23,381
RIGHT?

5503
09:51:23,381 --> 09:51:24,181
IT'S GREAT.

5504
09:51:24,181 --> 09:51:25,883
BUT I TOLD THEM, I SAID YOU MAY 

5505
09:51:25,883 --> 09:51:28,653
NOT WANT TO DO WHAT'S THERE.

5506
09:51:28,653 --> 09:51:29,820
YOU MAY WANT TO DO A SMALLER 

5507
09:51:29,820 --> 09:51:31,922
VERSION OF IT OR, YOU KNOW, AND 

5508
09:51:31,922 --> 09:51:33,124
THAT COULD BE.

5509
09:51:33,124 --> 09:51:35,026
ALTHOUGH I TELL YOU WHAT, HE 

5510
09:51:35,026 --> 09:51:36,494
LOOKED AT THAT TAPE.

5511
09:51:36,494 --> 09:51:39,296
HE LOOKED AT THAT iPAD AND I'M 

5512
09:51:39,296 --> 09:51:42,232
TELLING YOU THEY REALLY ENJOYED 

5513
09:51:42,232 --> 09:51:43,868

5514
09:51:43,868 --> 09:51:44,068

GO AHEAD.

5519
09:51:50,374 --> 09:51:51,142

5520
09:51:51,142 --> 09:51:53,844

5521
09:51:53,844 --> 09:51:55,179

5530
09:52:04,855 --> 09:52:06,991
>> IN WHAT WAY?

5531
09:52:06,991 --> 09:52:09,293

VIEW IT THAT WAY.

5537
09:52:16,300 --> 09:52:18,336
I DON'T VIEW IT THAT WAY.

5538
09:52:18,336 --> 09:52:19,703
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO 

5539
09:52:19,703 --> 09:52:22,340

IF I HAVE TO SAY I'M SITTING ON

5542

5548
09:52:38,255 --> 09:52:39,123

AGAIN, YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN THE 

5553
09:52:46,130 --> 09:52:49,767
FACT THAT IT IS TAKING MY TIME, 

5554
09:52:49,767 --> 09:52:52,937
THEY HAVE GIVEN UP A TREMENDOUS 

5555
09:52:52,937 --> 09:52:53,170
AMOUNT.

5556
09:52:53,170 --> 09:52:54,972
THEY'VE GIVEN IT UP EVEN BEFORE 

5557
09:52:54,972 --> 09:52:56,440
AND EVEN ADD THE OLYMPICS TO IT.

5558
09:52:56,440 --> 09:52:57,374
YOU COULD ADD THE OLYMPICS TO 

5559
09:52:57,374 --> 09:52:58,109
THE QUESTION.

5560
09:52:58,109 --> 09:52:59,577
THEY WENT TO THE OLYMPICS.

5561
09:52:59,577 --> 09:53:00,544
THEY TOOK AN OLYMPICS THAT WAS 

5562
09:53:00,544 --> 09:53:02,913
GOING TO BE A MASSIVE FAILURE 

5563
09:53:02,913 --> 09:53:04,181
THAT MAYBE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN 

5564
09:53:04,181 --> 09:53:06,984
OPENED AND MADE IT A TREMENDOUS 

5565
09:53:06,984 --> 09:53:08,185
SUCCESS BY AGREEING TO

5794
09:59:42,446 --> 09:59:44,515
WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE BACK

5795
09:59:44,515 --> 09:59:45,215
ALSO FROM THE ROOM.

5796
09:59:45,215 --> 09:59:48,185
SO WHEN WE WENT INTO THIS FINAL 

5797
09:59:48,185 --> 09:59:49,753
AGREEMENT, VERY IMPORTANTLY WE 

5798
09:59:49,753 --> 09:59:51,588
DIDN'T GO IN COLD BUT WITH 

5799
09:59:51,588 --> 09:59:52,856
TREMENDOUS RELATIONSHIP AND 

5800
09:59:52,856 --> 09:59:53,724
TREMENDOUS KNOWLEDGE AND I THINK

5801
09:59:53,724 --> 09:59:55,426
THAT'S WHY WE GOT IT DONE.

5802
09:59:55,426 --> 09:59:56,760
SO I'M GOING TO HEAD BACK.

5803
09:59:56,760 --> 09:59:58,761
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS BUT

5804
09:59:58,761 --> 10:00:05,702
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE

5805
10:00:05,702 --> 10:00:07,638
TAKEN IT EASY.

5806
10:00:07,638 --> 10:00:08,872
I HOPE WE'VE ANSWER THE YOUR 

5807
10:00:08,872 --> 10:00:09,740

5808
10:00:09,740 --> 10:00:15,813

AND GET IT COMPLETED BECAUSE 

5817
10:00:27,324 --> 10:00:28,592
OTHERWISE WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB 

5818
10:00:28,592 --> 10:00:29,793
BUT IF YOU DON'T GET THE BALL 

5819
10:00:29,793 --> 10:00:32,262
OVER THE GOAL LINE, IT DOESN'T 

5820
10:00:32,262 --> 10:00:33,430
MEAN ENOUGH.

5821
10:00:33,430 --> 10:00:33,630
OKAY.

5822
10:00:33,630 --> 10:00:35,766

THANK YOU.

5828
10:00:42,906 --> 10:00:44,575
>> CANDOR FROM THE PRESIDENT WHO

5829
10:00:44,575 --> 10:00:47,411
SAID HE NOW WANTS TO COMPLETE 

5830
10:00:47,411 --> 10:00:49,813
THIS, WANTS TO GET THE BALL OVER

5831
10:00:49,813 --> 10:00:50,814
THE FINISH LINE.

5832
10:00:50,814 --> 10:00:51,882
YOU HEARD HIM TALKING FOR MORE 

5833
10:00:51,882 --> 10:00:53,217
THAN AN HOUR FROM REPORTERS ALL 

5834
10:00:53,217 --> 10:00:54,551
OVER THE WORLD ABOUT THE HISTORY

5835
10:00:54,551 --> 10:00:56,319
THAT UNFOLDED IN SINGAPORE 

5836
10:00:56,319 --> 10:00:58,121
MEETING FACE-TO-FACE, THE FIRST 

5837
10:00:58,121 --> 10:00:59,623
TIME A SITTING UNDER ARMOUR 

5838
10:00:59,623 --> 10:01:00,724
PRESIDENT MET FACE-TO-FACE WITH 

5839
10:01:00,724 --> 10:01:03,760
THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AND IN

5840
10:01:03,760 --> 10:01:06,163
TALKING TO THEM HE TURNED TO THE

5841
10:01:06,163 --> 10:01:07,397
AGREEMENT THAT THEY SIGNED, A 

5842
10:01:07,397 --> 10:01:08,565
LETTER THEY SIGNED POINTING TO 

5843
10:01:08,565 --> 10:01:10,667
THAT ONE LINE, UNWAVERING 

5844
10:01:10,667 --> 10:01:13,137
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 

5845
10:01:13,137 --> 10:01:13,737
DENUCLEARIZATION POINTING TO 

5846
10:01:13,737 --> 10:01:15,139
THAT LINE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

5847
10:01:15,139 --> 10:01:17,340
HE SAID WITHOUT THE RHETORIC 

5848
10:01:17,340 --> 10:01:20,243
RATCHETING UP THE RHETORIC THIS 

5849
10:01:20,243 --> 10:01:21,645
LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

5850
10:01:21,645 --> 10:01:22,679
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE 

5851
10:01:22,679 --> 10:01:22,979
SANCTIONS.

5852
10:01:22,979 --> 10:01:24,447
HE SAID THEY WILL COME OFF WHEN 

5853
10:01:24,447 --> 10:01:25,682
NUKES ARE NO LONGER A FACTOR AND

5854
10:01:25,682 --> 10:01:27,518
SAID HE HOPES SANCTIONS WILL 

5855
10:01:27,518 --> 10:01:28,218
COME OFF SOON.

5856
10:01:28,218 --> 10:01:29,853
AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE U.S. 

5857
10:01:29,853 --> 10:01:31,354
MILITARY, HE SAID THERE WILL BE 

5858
10:01:31,354 --> 10:01:33,290
NOT ANY REDUCTION IN THE NUMBERS

5859
10:01:33,290 --> 10:01:35,058
OF U.S. MILITARY ON THE KOREAN 

5860
10:01:35,058 --> 10:01:35,993
PENINSULA IN THE REGION BUT THAT

5861
10:01:35,993 --> 10:01:39,530
THE WAR GAMES COMMONLY SEEN WITH

5862
10:01:39,530 --> 10:01:41,298
SOUTH KOREA WILL COME TO AN END 

5863
10:01:41,298 --> 10:01:43,667
AND WILL SAVE THE U.S. A LOT OF 

5864
10:01:43,667 --> 10:01:44,768
MONEY IN HIS WORDS.

5865
10:01:44,768 --> 10:01:46,269
HE DID SAY HE WOULD TRAVEL TO 

5866
10:01:46,269 --> 10:01:47,671
PYONGYANG WHEN THE TIME IS 

5867
10:01:47,671 --> 10:01:47,904
RIGHT.

5868
10:01:47,904 --> 10:01:49,306
AND THAT HE WOULD INVITE 

5869
10:01:49,306 --> 10:01:51,408
CHAIRMAN KIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

5870
10:01:51,408 --> 10:01:52,209
AGAIN, POINTING OUT WHEN THE 

5871
10:01:52,209 --> 10:01:53,076
TIME IS RIGHT.

5872
10:01:53,076 --> 10:01:56,013
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 

5873
10:01:56,013 --> 10:01:56,580
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 

5874
10:01:56,580 --> 10:01:58,649
JONATHAN KARL IN THE ROOM.

5875
10:01:58,649 --> 10:01:59,950
YOU HEARD HIM DESCRIBE KIM AS 

5876
10:01:59,950 --> 10:02:00,851
VERY TALENTED.

5877
10:02:00,851 --> 10:02:07,691
VERY SMART AND GOOD NEGOTIATOR.

5878
10:02:07,691 --> 10:02:10,694
>> WARM WORDS ABOUT CHAIRMAN 

5879
10:02:10,694 --> 10:02:11,461
KEEP.

5880
10:02:11,461 --> 10:02:13,496
HE ALSO FACED SOME QUESTIONS, I 

5881
10:02:13,496 --> 10:02:15,565
ASKED HIM ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS

5882
10:02:15,565 --> 10:02:17,467
SITUATION IN NORTH KOREA.

5883
10:02:17,467 --> 10:02:19,035
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO, DAVID, 

5884
10:02:19,035 --> 10:02:20,136
THAT THE PRESIDENT IN HIS STATE 

5885
10:02:20,136 --> 10:02:24,841
OF THE UNION ADDRESS SAID THAT 

5886
10:02:24,841 --> 10:02:26,777
KIM JONG-UN LEADS THE MOW 

5887
10:02:26,777 --> 10:02:28,946
REPRESSIVE REGIME ON THE PLANET.

5888
10:02:28,946 --> 10:02:31,414
HE SPOKE VERY FORCEFULLY ABOUT 

5889
10:02:31,414 --> 10:02:34,284
THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION BACK 

5890
10:02:34,284 --> 10:02:34,484
THEN.

5891
10:02:34,484 --> 10:02:35,652
NOW, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED LIKE IT

5892
10:02:35,652 --> 10:02:37,053
WAS NOT A MAJOR PART OF THIS 

5893
10:02:37,053 --> 10:02:38,455
DISCUSSION ALTHOUGH IT WAS 

5894
10:02:38,455 --> 10:02:39,389
INTERESTING IN HIS ANSWER TO ME 

5895
10:02:39,389 --> 10:02:41,725
ON THAT, HE BOTH SAID HE SPOKE 

5896
10:02:41,725 --> 10:02:42,925
VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 

5897
10:02:42,925 --> 10:02:46,129
IN THE MEETING AND HE SPOKE 

5898
10:02:46,129 --> 10:02:46,896
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 

5899
10:02:46,896 --> 10:02:48,732
IN THE MEALING BUT THE BOTTOM 

5900
10:02:48,732 --> 10:02:50,066
LINE HERE IS THE PRESIDENT 

5901
10:02:50,066 --> 10:02:52,068
BELIEVES THAT HE IS ON A PATH 

5902
10:02:52,068 --> 10:02:53,670
TOWARDS PEACE, THAT THIS WAS A 

5903
10:02:53,670 --> 10:02:54,571
LANDMARK DAY FOR HIM.

5904
10:02:54,571 --> 10:02:56,940
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM ANSWER 

5905
10:02:56,940 --> 10:02:59,309
QUESTIONS IN A VENUE ANYTHING 

5906
10:02:59,309 --> 10:02:59,810
LIKE THIS.

5907
10:02:59,810 --> 10:03:01,578
THIS IS REALLY HIS FIRST FULL 

5908
10:03:01,578 --> 10:03:03,246
BLOWN PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE 

5909
10:03:03,246 --> 10:03:05,082
FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR.

5910
10:03:05,082 --> 10:03:07,284
HE CLEARLY CONSIDERS THIS A 

5911
10:03:07,284 --> 10:03:10,621
LANDMARK ACHIEVEMENT, A 

5912
10:03:10,621 --> 10:03:11,488
SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT AND WANTED

5913
10:03:11,488 --> 10:03:13,523
TO TALK ABOUT IT ALTHOUGH IT WAS

5914
10:03:13,523 --> 10:03:14,858
EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE 

5915
10:03:14,858 --> 10:03:17,661
MANY, MANY DETAILS THAT ARE 

5916
10:03:17,661 --> 10:03:19,562
NOWHERE NEAR WORKED OUT AND WE 

5917
10:03:19,562 --> 10:03:21,298
ARE A LONG WAY FROM AN ACTUAL 

5918
10:03:21,298 --> 10:03:24,735
AGREEMENT ON DENUCLEARIZATION.

5919
10:03:24,735 --> 10:03:27,304
>> TWO OF THOSE KEY DEALS 

5920
10:03:27,304 --> 10:03:28,572
UNANSWERED, THOSE KEY QUESTIONS,

5921
10:03:28,572 --> 10:03:31,174
JON, AS YOU POINT ARE IS HOW 

5922
10:03:31,174 --> 10:03:32,108
MUCH HUMAN RIGHTS WERE 

5923
10:03:32,108 --> 10:03:32,375
DISCUSSED.

5924
10:03:32,375 --> 10:03:34,010
HE SAID IF HIS ANSWER TO JON 

5925
10:03:34,010 --> 10:03:35,812
KARL IT WAS DISCUSSED ABOUT THAT

5926
10:03:35,812 --> 10:03:37,180
THEY'LL NEED TO DIVE INTO IT 

5927
10:03:37,180 --> 10:03:38,748
MORE DEEPLY AND, OF COURSE, HOW 

5928
10:03:38,748 --> 10:03:41,918
HE WILL VERIFY THAT COMPLETE 

5929
10:03:41,918 --> 10:03:42,485
DENUCLEARIZATION ACTUALLY 

5930
10:03:42,485 --> 10:03:44,087
HAPPENS THAT, IS GOING TO BE THE

5931
10:03:44,087 --> 10:03:44,988
BIGGEST HURDLE GOING FORWARD, 

5932
10:03:44,988 --> 10:03:45,388
MARTHA RADDATZ. 

5933
10:03:45,388 --> 10:03:46,589
>> IT ABSOLUTELY WILL BE AND WE 

5934
10:03:46,589 --> 10:03:48,325
NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT AND

5935
10:03:48,325 --> 10:03:49,393
I'M SURE WE WILL LEARN MORE 

5936
10:03:49,393 --> 10:03:50,426
ABOUT IT IN THE FUTURE.

5937
10:03:50,426 --> 10:03:51,727
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS STRUCK 

5938
10:03:51,727 --> 10:03:53,830
BY IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 

5939
10:03:53,830 --> 10:03:56,333
AGAIN, IT WAS WELL OVER AN HOUR,

5940
10:03:56,333 --> 10:03:57,600
HE HAD REAL COMMAND OF THE 

5941
10:03:57,600 --> 10:03:57,968
ISSUES.

5942
10:03:57,968 --> 10:03:59,903
I THINK HE ENJOYED TAKING ALL 

5943
10:03:59,903 --> 10:04:00,369
THOSE QUESTIONS.

5944
10:04:00,369 --> 10:04:02,439
HE LIKED LETTING PEOPLE KNOW HOW

5945
10:04:02,439 --> 10:04:04,641
MUCH HE KNEW ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

5946
10:04:04,641 --> 10:04:06,977
I THINK ALL OF THIS WILL 

5947
10:04:06,977 --> 10:04:09,112
EMBOWLEN AND EMPOWER PRESIDENT 

5948
10:04:09,112 --> 10:04:11,415
TRUMP AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE 

5949
10:04:11,415 --> 10:04:13,917
SECOND HALF OF HIS PRESIDENCY 

5950
10:04:13,917 --> 10:04:15,886
BECAUSE THIS MAXIMUM PRESSURE 

5951
10:04:15,886 --> 10:04:17,754
CAMPAIGN BROUGHT US TO WHERE WE 

5952
10:04:17,754 --> 10:04:18,689
ARE TODAY.

5953
10:04:18,689 --> 10:04:20,090
THERE'S LOTS TO BE DONE.

5954
10:04:20,090 --> 10:04:21,692
THERE'S LOTS OF DETAIL.

5955
10:04:21,692 --> 10:04:23,026
THERE'S LOTS OF VERIFICATION 

5956
10:04:23,026 --> 10:04:24,761
THAT HAS TO HAPPEN BUT FOR NOW 

5957
10:04:24,761 --> 10:04:25,529
THAT CAMPAIGN WORKED. 

5958
10:04:25,529 --> 10:04:27,664
>> AND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS

5959
10:04:27,664 --> 10:04:31,368
THE MEDIA AND KNOWS HOW TO 

5960
10:04:31,368 --> 10:04:32,435
INTERACT HE LOOKED OUT AND SAID 

5961
10:04:32,435 --> 10:04:33,637
THE NUMBER OF REPORTERS FROM ALL

5962
10:04:33,637 --> 10:04:36,339
OVER THE WORLD HAVE AN IMPACT 

5963
10:04:36,339 --> 10:04:40,610
EVEN ON HIM AND MADE HIM FEEL 

5964
10:04:40,610 --> 10:04:42,079
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ANSWERED 

5965
10:04:42,079 --> 10:04:43,413
QUESTIONS WITH A CALM DEMEANOR 

5966
10:04:43,413 --> 10:04:45,382
WHICH I THOUGHT TOM BOSSERT 

5967
10:04:45,382 --> 10:04:46,716
REFLECTED HIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF

5968
10:04:46,716 --> 10:04:47,817
THE HISTORY, THE POSSIBILITIES 

5969
10:04:47,817 --> 10:04:49,986
OF THIS MOMENT AND AS I 

5970
10:04:49,986 --> 10:04:51,054
MENTIONED, HIS CANDOR IN THE END

5971
10:04:51,054 --> 10:04:52,989
THERE SAYING THIS IS HISTORY BUT

5972
10:04:52,989 --> 10:04:54,624
IT ALSO HAS TO BE COMPLETED.

5973
10:04:54,624 --> 10:04:55,091
HE RECOGNIZES THAT. 

5974
10:04:55,091 --> 10:04:56,326
>> I THINK MARTHA IS RIGHT.

5975
10:04:56,326 --> 10:04:57,594
THIS WAS A PRESIDENT IN COMMAND 

5976
10:04:57,594 --> 10:04:58,462
OF HIS MATERIAL.

5977
10:04:58,462 --> 10:05:00,097
I'VE SEEN HIM IN COMMAND OF HIS 

5978
10:05:00,097 --> 10:05:01,365
MATERIAL PRIVATELY BUT THIS 

5979
10:05:01,365 --> 10:05:03,200
PUBLICLY WAS REALLY SOMETHING TO

5980
10:05:03,200 --> 10:05:03,400
WATCH.

5981
10:05:03,400 --> 10:05:04,300
I THINK WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

5982
10:05:04,300 --> 10:05:06,403
ARE GOING TO WAKE UP TO NOW TO 

5983
10:05:06,403 --> 10:05:08,071
TODAY IS FIND THIS PRESIDENT HAS

5984
10:05:08,071 --> 10:05:09,673
NOW SECURED A BLUEPRINT FOR 

5985
10:05:09,673 --> 10:05:09,873
PEACE.

5986
10:05:09,873 --> 10:05:11,474
IT'S GOING TO BE THE BEGINNING 

5987
10:05:11,474 --> 10:05:14,076
OF AN ARDUOUS PROCESS AND IT 

5988
10:05:14,076 --> 10:05:15,512
WILL TAKE TIME BUT IT'S 

5989
10:05:15,512 --> 10:05:15,812
REMARKABLE. 

5990
10:05:15,812 --> 10:05:18,081
>> HE WAS ASKED BY OUR OWN 

5991
10:05:18,081 --> 10:05:18,715

5992
10:05:18,715 --> 10:05:20,417

10:05:23,887 --> 10:05:24,954

5996
10:05:24,954 --> 10:05:26,156

WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF

EFFORT.

11:07:17,997 --> 11:07:20,032

PASSING ALONG DETAILS FROM THE

SUMMIT.

6052

ABC'S BOB WOODRUFF HAS BEEN 

6053
11:07:37,049 --> 11:07:38,951

6054

HAS REACTION FROM THERE. 

6055
11:07:40,487 --> 11:07:41,988
>> Reporter: THE SOUTH KOREANS 

6056
11:07:41,988 --> 11:07:43,756

6057
11:07:43,756 --> 11:07:45,591
SEEING SOME OF THE RESULTS.

6058
11:07:45,591 --> 11:07:47,427
RIGHT DOWNTOWN SEOUL AND WANT TO

6060
11:07:49,129 --> 11:07:50,129
CAPITAL BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOW 

6061
11:07:50,129 --> 11:07:51,197
STARTING TO COME OUT OF WORK A 

6062
11:07:51,197 --> 11:07:51,865
LITTLE BIT.

6063
11:07:51,865 --> 11:07:53,166
IT'S BEEN PRETTY DULL MOST OF 

6064
11:07:53,166 --> 11:07:53,933
THE DAY.

6065
11:07:53,933 --> 11:07:55,335
BUT NOW THEY'RE HITTING THE 

6066
11:07:55,335 --> 11:07:55,602
STREETS.

6067
11:07:55,602 --> 11:07:56,802
THIS IS THE BLUE HOUSE, THIS IS 

6068
11:07:56,802 --> 11:07:58,872
THEIR EQUIVALENT OF THE WHITE 

6069
11:07:58,872 --> 11:07:59,072
HOUSE.

6070
11:07:59,072 --> 11:08:00,673
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE POLITICS 

6071
11:08:00,673 --> 11:08:00,906
HAPPENS.

6072
11:08:00,906 --> 11:08:02,175
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE BIG 

6073
11:08:02,175 --> 11:08:03,176
MEETINGS ARE HAPPENING.

6074
11:08:03,176 --> 11:08:04,310
BUT THIS IS DOWNTOWN.

6075
11:08:04,310 --> 11:08:06,312
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF 

6076
11:08:06,312 --> 11:08:07,480
THINGS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE 

6077
11:08:07,480 --> 11:08:08,448
U.S. EMBASSY.

6078
11:08:08,448 --> 11:08:10,082
YOU CAN SEE THE AMERICAN FLAG 

6079
11:08:10,082 --> 11:08:11,450
RIGHT THERE.

6080
11:08:11,450 --> 11:08:14,954
SO THAT'S GUARDED OUTSIDE BY 

6081
11:08:14,954 --> 11:08:17,490
MULTIPLE GUARDS.

6082
11:08:17,490 --> 11:08:18,791
THE POLICE OFFICES ARE OUTSIDE.

6083
11:08:18,791 --> 11:08:19,892
IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE THIS IS 

6084
11:08:19,892 --> 11:08:21,327
FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN 

6085
11:08:21,327 --> 11:08:22,828
THIS, SOMEBODY SAYING AGAINST 

6086
11:08:22,828 --> 11:08:24,864
THE PEACE TALKS WITHOUT NORTH 

6087
11:08:24,864 --> 11:08:26,299
KOREANS HUMAN RIGHTS, SO PEOPLE 

6088
11:08:26,299 --> 11:08:28,667
WANT THIS TO BE TALKED ABOUT AT 

6089
11:08:28,667 --> 11:08:29,369
THIS SUMMIT.

6090
11:08:29,369 --> 11:08:30,870
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, LISTEN, KIM

6091
11:08:30,870 --> 11:08:32,572
JONG-UN IS NOT THIS PEACEFUL 

6092
11:08:32,572 --> 11:08:32,738
MAN.

6093
11:08:32,738 --> 11:08:34,307
THIS IS ONE WHO COMMITTED A LOT 

6094
11:08:34,307 --> 11:08:35,275
OF CRIMES.

6095
11:08:35,275 --> 11:08:37,544
HE'S ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS HALF

6096
11:08:37,544 --> 11:08:39,011
BROTHER AND HIS UNCLE SO THEY 

6097
11:08:39,011 --> 11:08:40,980
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT TOPIC AS

6098
11:08:40,980 --> 11:08:41,180
WELL.

6099
11:08:41,180 --> 11:08:42,915
SO EXACTLY WHAT THE REACTION TO 

6100
11:08:42,915 --> 11:08:44,383
THIS SUMMIT IS STILL PRETTY 

6101
11:08:44,383 --> 11:08:45,451
UNCLEAR BUT PEOPLE ARE STARTING 

6102
11:08:45,451 --> 11:08:47,887
TO TALK TO ME AND THEY SAID THAT

6103
11:08:47,887 --> 11:08:49,188
THEY'RE HAPPY THAT SOMETHING 

6104
11:08:49,188 --> 11:08:50,423
POSITIVE COULD COME OUT OF IT 

6105
11:08:50,423 --> 11:08:51,591
BUT THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE 

6106
11:08:51,591 --> 11:08:55,228
THIS IS DONE PROPERLY.

6107
11:08:55,228 --> 11:08:57,563
THEY TRUST PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT 

6108
11:08:57,563 --> 11:08:58,564
DON'T REALLY TRUST KIM JONG-UN 

6109
11:08:58,564 --> 11:08:59,432
AT ALL.

6110
11:08:59,432 --> 11:09:01,467
PART OF IT IS THAT HISTORY.

6111
11:09:01,467 --> 11:09:02,735
NORTH KOREA, WE DON'T REALLY 

6112
11:09:02,735 --> 11:09:03,836
KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE'S REAL 

6113
11:09:03,836 --> 11:09:04,537
THOUGHTS ARE.

6114
11:09:04,537 --> 11:09:06,072
YOU KNOW, INSIDE THEIR SOUL IT'S

6115
11:09:06,072 --> 11:09:07,140
HARD TO KNOW.

6116
11:09:07,140 --> 11:09:08,841
EVERY TIME WE VISIT NORTH KOREA 

6117
11:09:08,841 --> 11:09:10,743
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY MINDERS.

6118
11:09:10,743 --> 11:09:11,410
THE JOURNALISTS CAN'T TALK TO 

6119
11:09:11,410 --> 11:09:13,079
THE PEOPLE WITHOUT REAL FREEDOM.

6120
11:09:13,079 --> 11:09:14,714
THEY ALSO LISTEN TO WHAT THE 

6121
11:09:14,714 --> 11:09:15,748

6122
11:09:15,748 --> 11:09:16,949
SAYING WHEN THEY'RE INTERVIEWED 

6123
11:09:16,949 --> 11:09:19,018
BY US SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW 

6124
11:09:19,018 --> 11:09:20,753
WHAT THEY'RE THINKING BUT 

6125
11:09:20,753 --> 11:09:22,088
