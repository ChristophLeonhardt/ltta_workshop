00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,172
I READ IT COVER TO RECOVER.

00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,842
-- TO COVER.

3
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:10,011
JOINING US NOW GERALDO RIVERA

4
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:11,813
AND DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.

5
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:14,983
GERALDO, YOU WROTE A GREAT

6
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:15,550
COLUMN TODAY.

7
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:18,954
SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

8
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:19,387
HAPPEN.

9
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:22,090
I DON'T WANT A CONFRONTATION AT

10
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:23,358
OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,361
SOMEBODY WILL GET HURT OR WORSE

12
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:28,730
AT THAT BORDER.

13
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:31,833
IF THEY MAKE IT FROM MEXICO IN

14
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:34,169
THE CARAVAN, WE HAVE AGREED.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,604
BUILD THE WALL IT WOULD BE GOOD

16
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:39,040
FOR BOTH SIDES IF IT WAS UP FOR

17
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,308
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT

18
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:41,843
BE COMING.

19
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:42,711
THE PRESIDENT ALREADY GAVE THE

20
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:44,846
DEAL YOU ARE OFFERING.

21
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:53,421
HE OFFERED TO MAKE THE

22
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:54,689
ACCOMMODATION FOR DREAMERS.

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,225
NOW PODESTA'S GROUP IS SAYING

24
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:58,527
DON'T TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

25
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:02,430
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT

26
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,331
THE CARAVAN OR ILLEGAL

27
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:08,036
IMMIGRANTS WITH 2 WEEKS TO GO

28
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:11,506
BEFORE THIS WHITE-HOT MID-TERM

29
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:11,873
ELECTION.

30
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:17,712
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE RATIONAL

31
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:18,814
ABOUT THIS.

32
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:22,317
THIS IS NOT ABOUT MS-13.

33
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:26,288
THIS IS NOT ABOUT MIDDLE EAST

34
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:31,593
ERIN MCPIKES.

35
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:37,199
-- MIDDLE EASTERNERS.

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,734
YOU DON'T KNOW ONE PERSON IN

00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:41,169
THAT CAWED.

38
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,304
-- CROWD.

39
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:45,307
IT WOULD BE EASY TO FIND MS-13.

40
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:47,142
THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE

41
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:48,176
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

42
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:51,713
PEOPLE DESPERATE TO IMPROVE

43
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:56,852
THEIR LOT IN LIFE.

>> [OVERLAPPING TALKING].

45
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:01,189
>> Sean: WE WON'T LET THEM IN.

46
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,091
NOT THIS WAY.

47
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:05,894
>> WE HAVE A SOVEREIGNTY AND

48
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:06,695

SEAN?

51
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:10,332
>> Sean: NO.

52
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,567
THEY NEED TO BE STOPPED IN

53
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:13,034
MEXICO.

54
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:15,170
ARE YOU GOING TO JUST SAY COME

55
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:19,107
ON IN AND NEVER VET THEM?

56
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:20,141

57
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:26,948
>> THIS IS REALLY BENEATH YOU.

58
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:27,282
GERALDO.

59
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:31,419

60
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,786
STUFF!

61
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:35,223
>> GERALDO, I AM AN IMMIGRANT.

62
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:36,892
OKAY IN IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS

63
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,027
MUCH AS IT IS TO YOU.

64
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,496
TO WRITE AN ARTICLE AND COME ON

65
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:42,764
SEAN'S SAY AND SAY WHERE YOU

66
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:43,899
GOING TO SHOOT THEM?

67
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,433
THAT'S UNAMERICAN.

68
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,535
WE DON'T SAY STUFF LIKE THAT.

69
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:51,606
THIS IS NOT A DICTATORSHIP.

70
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:52,707
YOU CAN'T MAKE STATEMENTS.

71
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,875
>> WHAT DOES THE MILITARY DO?

72
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,244
>> WHAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR

73
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,413

THERE IS RIOTING.

76
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,652
IT'S BEEN DONE FOR 200 YEARS.
