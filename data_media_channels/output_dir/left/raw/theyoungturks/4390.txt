1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,039
EMPLOYERS IN
THE UNITED STATES ARE NOW

2
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,070
EXPLORING THE OPTION OF
MICRO-CHIPPING THEIR EMPLOYEES.

3
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,630
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, TAKE
THREE SQUARE MARKET, A WISCONSIN

4
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,190
COMPANY. ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES
AT THAT COMPANY WENT TO A BIO

5
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,059
HACK CONVENTION IN SWEDEN WHERE
THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE

6
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:48,399
CHIPS IS TRYING TO APPEAL TO
EMPLOYERS. WHAT WOULD IT DO? IT

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,420
WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO HAVE
ACCESS TO THE OFFICE BUILDING.

8
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,429
IT WOULD ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO
THE COMPUTER, AND IT WOULD MAKE

9
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:05,030
LIFE EASIER, MORE CONVENIENT,
BUT THERE ARE SOME PRIVACY

10
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:25,970
CONCERNS AS WELL. THIS MICROCHIP
IS IMPLANTED IN YOUR FINGER.

11
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,840
CRAZY.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:41,079
>> BEWARE OF MANAGERS WEARING
GIFTS. IN ALL FAIRNESS I THINK

13
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:50,280
THEY GENUINELY GOT EXCITED AND
THEY DO CARE ABOUT THE

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,159
TECHNOLOGY. FROM MY READING I
DON'T SEE A BAD INTENT.

15
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,090
>> MY SENSE AND READ OF THIS
COMPANY IS NOT THAT THERE IS ANY

16
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,560
MALICIOUS INTENT BUT THAT THEY
WANT TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE.

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,790
SO IT IS EXCITING. BUT THERE ARE
SOME REVOCATIONS TO THAT.

18
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:23,850
>> AND IT IS NOT JUST A Q PARTY
THEY HAD CHIPS AND SALSA. BUT

19
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,330
THIS STARTS AS YOU CAN TURN ON A
COMPUTER WITH YOUR HAND. YOU

20
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,850
THINK THEY CAN'T TRACK WHERE YOU
ARE MOVING IF THERE IS A CHIP

21
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:44,530
INSIDE YOU? WHY WOULD YOUR
EMPLOYER 

22
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:56,400
WANT TO 

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,899
DO THAT?

24
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:06,480
>> I HAVE NO PROBLEM TURNING ON
MY COMPUTER WITH MY FINGERS. I

25
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,760
HAVE NO PROBLEM USING A KEY OR
ANYTHING I NEED TO USE OTHER

26
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,250
THAN A MICROCHIP TO OPEN A DOOR
TO MY OFFICE. I FEEL LIKE WE GET

27
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,700
SO EXCITED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THAT
WE DON'T THINK ENOUGH ABOUT HOW

28
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:34,370
INVASIVE IT COULD BE,
PRIVACY CONCERNS.

29
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,870
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
MICROCHIP.

30
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,770
WE ARE READY HAVE ENOUGH
TECHNOLOGY TRACKING WHAT WE

31
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,770
ARE DOING.

32
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,000
>> HAVING A CHIP INSIDE YOUR
BODY Ã± TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU SHOULD

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,320
HAVE TWO WORDS, HELL NO. I WILL
GIVE YOU MORE EXAMPLES OF WHAT

34
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,620
CAN GO WRONG BUT FIRST I WANT TO
KNOW HOW FUNNY WHAT ANNA SAID

35
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,500
WAS. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU CAN
TURN ON YOUR COMPUTER WITH YOUR

36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:12,230
OWN HAND? IT IS NOT THAT MUCH
HARDER TO PRESS THE BUTTON. THE

37
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:24,960
WASHINGTON POST NOTES TRACKABLE
DATA IS HACKABLE DATA. WHETHER

38
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:37,449
IT IS YOUR MANAGER OR SOMEONE
ELSE, WHAT 

39
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,389
IF YOUR-

40
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:47,310
>> THIS COULD ALSO INCLUDE
PAYMENT DATA TO USE THE CHIP FOR

41
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:56,180
THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO BUY. I
DON'T REALLY WANT A CHIP TO HAVE

42
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,039
THAT DATA.

43
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:05,719
I 
FEEL HAVING IT ON A MICROCHIP

44
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,819
IS JUST AN EXTRA LAYER OF A

45
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:13,400
POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK.

46
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,569
>> IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH
TIME TO TAKE OUT MY CREDIT CARD

47
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:22,050
OR DEBIT CARD AT THE GROCERY
STORE.

48
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:32,499
>>AND YOU CAN TURN OFF THE GPS
TRACKING.

49
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,830
>> THIS IS SCIENCE FICTION
BECOMING REALITY. EVEN IF YOU

50
00:05:36,830 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK THEY MEAN WELL, DON'T DO
IT. IT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
