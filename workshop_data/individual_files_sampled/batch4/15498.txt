to the left having a happy traditional family isn't just sexist anymore it's now white supremacy in an article published by the New York Times a Miss Annie Kelly a PhD student researching the impact of digital cultures on anti feminism and the far-right argue that white supremacy can be seen in the traditional family unit Kelly Ponder's over the story of Nicole Jorgensen a singer and former school teacher from North Dakota she discussed a podcast interview she did last year in which she talks about how she has never been happier since she got married and started a family kelly uses this podcast example as a way of tying everyone with a traditional family she talks about the dozens of YouTube and social media accounts that show young white women extolling the virtues of staying at home and having lots of children she complains about the 1950s advertising images that show mothers looking glamorous at home in lipstick and high heels what is wrong with that what is wrong with people choosing to live like this and what exactly is white supremacist about at all the traditional family unit is something that transcends borders it's not white no matter how many far-right housewives there might be out there it doesn't need all housewives afar rights or even white in fact the traditional family unit has been the foundation of societies all over the world there's nothing white about traditional family units but there is something uniquely Western about giving women is a choice to live in a traditional family unit or not increasingly though the left has attempted to break down that choice and discourage women from going down the path of raising children in a traditional family unit the left don't want women to have that choice anymore and that can be seen in the recent comments by a top Family Court Judge Sir James Mundy is the president of the Family Division of the High Court in the UK and he said that the collapse of the nuclear family should now be applauded owing to the rise of single and same-sex parent families he said this I stress is not merely the reality it is I believe a reality which we should welcome and applaud a City University of New York professor also said last year that nuclear families promote white supremacy and that parents should stop leaving their homes to their children if the left really wants to give women a choice why won't they leave women who want traditional life and family in peace running a household is a hugely important role especially for growing children and why do the Left smear traditional housewives based on the existence of a handful of far-right traditional wives remember a square is a rectangle that a rectangle is not a square this is basic logic and the left as always refused to acknowledge it the world is full of traditional families countless societies were founded on traditional family units and nuclear families in the free West women have a choice about how they want to live their lives but as ever the left wants to strip that away and whip women into line we want to beat this tyranny you must vindicate the housewife pay respect to the women who step up and take on the monumental role of raising children resistance to the tyranny of the left is simply a matter of living how we wish to live and acknowledging the beauty of raising a family I want to thank the modern-day housewife for doing what they're doing for Darren to live how they want to live and for their important contribution to society you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
