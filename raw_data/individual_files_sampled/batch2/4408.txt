bombshell reports tonight the Bob Miller's boss talked about wiretapping President Trump or even a ousting the president the United States to the 25th amendment of the Constitution that's of course the way that you remove a president who is deemed unable to handle the job you need to support the cabinet and the Congress if you're hearing these words if they're sinking in then you know already this is not some Friday night news dump this is a Friday night explosion but these claims and these stories tonight are also hotly contested they may portend an irreversible escalation in the handling of the Malheur probe itself and whether President Trump will seize on this report which is in the New York Times to pursue his own version of a Saturday night massacre so given the sheer scale of this we are gonna start our broadcast here on the beat a little differently tonight we're gonna begin with the context for these explosive leaks and some of the skepticism about them then I'm gonna share with you exactly what we know both the New York Times report and some conflicting accounts excuse me some conflicting accounts from some other very high-level sources and then we'll turn to our experts so first there's the context here the heat on Donald Trump right now has never been hotter with the DOJ flipping his former campaign chair and his longtime personal lawyer in fact it's only in the past days and weeks that the news leaked that both men are not only guilty but are talking to Bob Muller so it's amidst that heat that now sources inside and outside the DOJ say it's no surprise that we're seeing fresh attacks on the DOJ leadership maybe giving everything they've got the NYT report focuses on a few comments that were made in a meeting that these sources say we're either sarcastic joke so we're never acted on and note how odd it is that conversations from well over a year ago would be leaking out right now at the boiling point of cooperation in this Russia probe and before I read you the Times account I want you to know what else we're learning tonight the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer is warning against this entire story against using these leaks as a pretext for Donald Trump to do what many think he's wanted to do for a long time which is kneecap the Bob Miller probe by firing Bob Mueller's boss rod Rosen Stein so that's the context that's the congressional fallout at this hour now let me show you exactly what the New York Times reporting that molars boss rod Rosen Stein was basically aghast at how Trump was operating after firing James Comey and thus he secretly suggested recording Trump and discussed even the 25th amendment the idea of using a wire to quote secretly taped the president when he visited the White House or of others doing so since a key question at the time was whether Donald Trump fire James Comey to stop the rush of probe and whether the other officials should try to tape him during interviews over who would replace Comey now the article reports that Rosen Stein got into the mechanics of it noting White House officials never checked his phone when he arrived for those meetings and then there is the passage that is by far the most shocking that is certainly rattling the internet the claim that rod Rosen sign thought he might get Jeff Sessions and John Kelly who then had a DHS to use the 25th amendment to remove Trump now the article includes Rosenstein denying this entire story has quote factually incorrect and includes another DOJ officials saying that someone at the meeting thought that Times was basically misconstruing the reference to a wire and that was actually made quote sarcastically now that is what the New York Times reports this story obviously appears quite helpful to Donald Trump's view of a deep State Justice Department out to get him and The Times does not claim it's reporting is based on people who actually heard Rosenstein say any of those things let me point you to investigative journalist Marcy wheeler noting tonight not a single one of these people The Times quotes was actually a witness to the episodes none of them had even read the memos memorializing the events directly and if instead simply been briefed secondhand and then there are the other sources and because this is so important because this could potentially change everything let's go through it in detail because late today goj officials are telling NBC News the meeting in question in May was at a secure facility it was a week after Trump fired Comey as FBI director and the day before Rosen Stein made that big move to a point Muller and this official tells us quote seven people were there Rosenstein McCabe who was then acting as commis replacement an FBI lawyer Lisa page and four career DOJ officials including Scott schools and this important because he's the career official who would later sign off on the decision to fire McCabe himself quote Rosen Steiner McCabe were arguing and at one point Rosen Stein asked well what do you want me to do and II wear a wire to DOJ officials say the remark was made sarcastically according to what this official tells NBC as for raising the issue of invoking the 25th amendment the senior DOJ official says there's a brief reference to it in a note about the meeting that was written again by McCabe dag' that would be Rosen Stein raises 25th amendment and quote the official says the notes about the same meeting taken by Lisa page don't reference it at all and that Rosenstein didn't raise it this person telling NBC the notion that he would wat want to talk about discussing this with Kelly makes no sense he didn't even know Kelly then now I can tell you the public timeline does back that up Rosen Stein had been in the post three weeks Kelly was not a big player in the Trump White House at the time he didn't become chief of staff till later in July now as a DOJ lawyer Rosenstein would know it also takes a lot more than just some cabinet members to really use the 25th amendment you need a super majority in Congress but the Republicans of course are in charge there now this story is contested by the people involved there's no doubt about one thing and why it is such a big story tonight this now lives in the white-hot center of the controversy over what Trump's gonna do about a Russia probe that is heading for the White House Donald Trump's son is seizing on the report saying it proves that DOJ is top guys will do anything in their power to undermine Donald Trump meanwhile journalist Gabriel Sherman who wrote a book on Fox News is reporting Knight that the man you see there former Fox executive bill Cheyne who now runs White House communications for Trump is preparing a media plan to quote build public support for Trump to fire Rosen Stein and here is a new call from Fox anchor Laura Ingraham calling for Trump to do just that so let's get to our experts now that we've laid out the multiple dimensions of this story Kim Whaley is a law professor at the University of Baltimore she was a federal prosecutor who worked directly with rod Rosenstein Nick Ackerman has much experience as a former Watergate special prosecutor and part of the reporting I mention NBC's Intel national security journalist Kendall a nyan is here for what he knows about it Kim I begin with you when you read the New York Times version secondhand of these things said by rod Rosenstein do they sound to you like things that he wanted to actively do to run a wiretap and remove the president or do you see them in some other life well what I know from rod Rosen Stein and I have known him professionally and personally for a long time is that he is a man of impeccable impeccable integrity and he's really someone who believes in public service and the rule of law and I think the question here is he's doing his job as Deputy Attorney General and I don't think there's any question that he's been doing that now of course Donald Trump can fire him under article 2 of the Constitution he has the power to do that but but that will have repercussions that are important because as you mentioned re really what's in the room is the fact that Vladimir Putin wants to destroy our democratic process he wants to tear people apart and part of that is attacking the career officials like rod Rosenstein who are working really hard to uncover what the Russians did to undermine our electoral process and to get to the bottom of it so you you see this explicitly as many of Muller's allies have seen it as Chuck Schumer was saying as a potential pretext to try to go after Rosen Stein what do you make those specifically of the notion that he was talking about wearing a wire I mean there is a federal process that would govern that if it were even serious your view no I wasn't there I mean rod can from time to time make jokes I mean he's a serious guy but he also has a sense of humor and obviously there was a tremendous amount of pressure in the room of course you know I wasn't there so there's no way that I can actually weigh in on what what happened or didn't happen but let's let's face it the other elephant in the room is the fact that whether 25th amendment was addressed or not he there are other people within the administration this anonymous op-ed we saw in the New York Times that have posited that that might be appropriate and we've seen publicly a president who is in chaos who is close to corruption if not corrupt and is there there's incompetence throughout the executive branch and as a constitutional law professor and someone who's was in public service I'm just deeply deeply concerned about the structure of our government because whether you're democratic or republican when it becomes damaged it's damaged for good it's like it's like a car that has the side swiped you know new people can drive that car but it's still going to be trashed until someone fixes it and at this point we're getting more and more broken and it's very very serious I really hope Rosen Stein can hang on and in these deeply politicized times and Kent digging into the people at the meeting will put on the screen because it's a lot to follow there's Rosenstein mccabe lisa page in these four career DOJ officials who are lesser-known McCabe of course was later fired and we know Donald Trump reportedly started chewing him out the moment he became acting director on the phone and attacking his wife Paige resigned and of course was figured into a scandal that House Republicans had seized on so you have Rosen Stein left with those officials one of your reporting tell us about the significance of what happened in that meeting well it's so hard to know what to believe re because as you said the Justice Department is pushing back on this vigorously both to Pete Williams and to me senior Justice Department officials are saying it absolutely did not happen the way the New York Times is describing it they're saying that Rosen Stein's remark was sarcastic and when you talk to people that know rod as Kim said he has a dry wit and and people say that it's possible that he said something in jest that maybe Andy McCabe took seriously and wrote it down in a memo as if he really meant to wear a wire but complicating this picture Ari is that the New York Times has reported in the last few minutes that there was a second instance where McCabe and Rosen Stein talked about rod Rosen Stein potentially recording the president are wearing a wire and the Justice Department again our sources are pushing back on that and so it's really the only thing I can say is there were four career people in the room in addition to those named people that you outlined and so this is a knowable fact I mean all these people can be interviewed and we can get to the bottom of it we do have and Andy McCabe's a contemporaneous memo and by the way some justice apartment officials are suggesting you know he has an ax to grind he was fired by the FBI but that wasn't true back in May 2017 when he wrote the memo he was the Deputy Director of the FBI and so I think his account should be given some credibility but again it's just a Hall of Mirrors we have two diametrically opposed encountered Ari Nick Ari I think this is just part of the overall effort to try and get rid of the Russian investigation one piece of the context that you didn't mention was that last week Donald Trump came out and was actually trying to declassify all of the classified information that was surrounding the Russian investigation at the request of certain Republicans in the house that are trying to undermine and destroy this investigation just today it was announced he wasn't going to do that probably because some other people within the administration that prevailed upon him so now we have another salvo out there trying to undermine this investigation undermine rod Rosenstein if you look at the two items that are being talked about one is the 25th amendment that is so cumbersome the idea that anybody seriously could think that they could use the 25th amendment here where you've got to get the majority of the cabinet to then write to the Speaker into the president pro tempore the Senate and then on top of that the president can override that by writing another letter and then the majority again of the cabinet members would have to write back to the speaker and senator pro-temp and there have to be a two-thirds vote of both chambers of Congress to remove the president that's not going to happen this amendment was designed for the situation where a president is really incapacitated about like Woodrow Wilson was right stay with me everybody I want to add to our discussion a founder and editor at large for the Weekly Standard Bill Kristol who's kept an eye on all these things bill you have been in White House's where everyone parses the leaks and this one is quite interesting I want to read more from the New York Times piece because the New York Times has clearly come down on the idea that Rosen Stein said these things and it meant something not that they are misconstrued quotes that's why their headline says Rosen side suggests you secretly record Trump although the article includes his denial and I want to read from the article where it says basically Rosen side made these remarks about secretly recording Trump in meetings and conversations with these officials several people described the episodes insisting on anonymity these people bill were briefed either on the events or on the memos does that look like a tell to you because we just went through on the screen all these anonymous people as well as Rosen Stein who's got the on the record denial the people doing the leaking that The Times finds credible are secondhand having read some other description of it that could well be and look at the end of the day either Rosen Stein was rattled and said a few things that he didn't follow through on and they were entirely speculative in terms of the 25th amendment and he knew he couldn't follow through on it I knew we thought couldn't follow through on wearing a wire tap either presumably or he was being witty sort of gallows humor or wit he's not quite right but just sardonic let's say and whatever he didn't do it right he's been Deputy Attorney General for a year and a half now we can judge his conduct in that job and I believe almost every outside observer who doesn't have a axe to grind takes his contacts been pretty impressive and that he has not he is sustained the rule of law defended the muddler investigation at times some critics would say he's given it a little too much to the president's directives but he is part of the administration after all so I see some vision let me know in that bill do you think that do you think that if what you just said applies then the times got played all right look it's possible I think reporters can get played it but they can also be reporting somewhat accurately mostly accurately slightly misunderstanding things the McCabe contemporaneous memo is the strongest thing in there on their side I would say that you Mobley the deputy director the FBI a man of some experience doesn't put in a memo something that's just a throwaway line though maybe he does you know or maybe they didn't know each other well and he misunderstood Rosen Steiner he was just trying to write everything down I don't know but we do need to I much agree with I think what everyone is basically said which is this does not give any ground so I really mean this any grounds at all in terms of any action of Rosen Stein that justifies firing him or firing sessions or curbing the Muller investigation and I think it's important to reiterate that that you know whatever he might have said in a private meeting that he didn't follow through on and there's no evidence he said again over the next 16 or however many months he's been Deputy Attorney General that gives no grounds to Trump to do anything now it does plenty of grass to Donald Trump jr. and Laura Ingraham and everyone to attack Rosenstein and let's just hope it stays at the level of rhetorical attacks I am worried given the Kevin or developments given other developments the Trump's just decides you know what it's just total chaos I'm good at this Thunderdome moments this is my chance to get rid of him and it'll all just look like chaos and that was kind of a conspiracy and you know we'll have an election anyway in five six weeks and maybe the Republicans will hang on to the Senate and so I think it's right to be alarmed that Trump could take advantage of this moment Kim well I think we have to ask ourselves what would actually happen so then the Solicitor General the United States would be put into place in an interim basis that's null Francisco he's also a Republican with pretty conservative credentials but someone who's highly I think respected as a as a lawyer so presumably he he wouldn't necessarily I would hope just go ahead and fire the fire Muller and call off that probe in addition mother's been really careful to farm out a lot of these criminal issues to other parts of the Justice Department the Southern District of New York in particular which and those people answer to Jeff Sessions so I just want people to errs to not be so so worried that even if if mr. Rosen Stein is fired that all of a sudden the Muller investigation is going to end but it's important to emphasize why is this so important then why is it more investigation so critical because the Congress is not doing its job oversight it's not actually doing any oversight of the President or looking into the serious serious allegations in the short term in the short term firing sessions in residence time which is what Trump wants to do he said he's gonna do it about sessions after November 60 now he said he wants to do with residence ID i I think it could do a lot of damage I mean I assume that the model investigation would one hopes continue USDA and why would continue we can all ask Congress to do more but in the real world that would be a real blow I believe to real attempts it would be a constitutional crisis it would be a real challenge to the integrity of the justice department and to the investigation of the Special Counsel I think I agree completely with that I mean and I've said I think we are literally in the twilight of democracy potentially in this country and people need to wake up and pay attention to these things it's not political but there are forces that are trying to ideologically divide us when at the end of the day so like rod Rosenstein is out there every day working for the American people for the for the regular person I can attest to that personally he is a true public servant hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
