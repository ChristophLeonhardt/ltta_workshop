we got to address the elephant in the room first Matt Lauer holy cow when you woke up this morning did you know that this was brewing over your thoughts no I didn't you know i because i'll not like variety in new york times to be working on stories you don't hear about these things so i didn't have any official knowledge but because of the work I do and the stories I cover and the connections I have in the industry I have a general feel for I mean I I knew the Charlie Rose thing was coming and I had heard rumors about Matt but that's all they were and my feeling on it was a rumor is not the same as reportable fact and it was also that I heard a lot of rumors about myself too that are completely untrue and when you're a public figure people do make up things about you and put them in print so I had no inside knowledge at all but I knew people were sniffing around the issue and you know hoped it wasn't true and wouldn't have been surprised if none of that had materialized and he had a long you know and enjoyable last whatever however many years he wanted to be at the Today Show
