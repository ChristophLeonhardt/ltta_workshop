remember how happy our meant getting together to have some laughs while enjoying half-price drinks well check out the happy hour at one Portland Oregon bar it works like this white people are discouraged from attending but white folks can make monetary donations to pay for the drinks of black brown and Native folks oh happy happy joy joy indeed once again let me offer a quick lament for the satirist employed at the onion given that such scribes are scribbling on thin ice these days how can a wise guy hope to solicit eyeballs with fictional lunacy when real-life lunacy trumps all and so it is that according to a New York Times article an activist organization called Brown Hope invited black Brown and indigenous people to a Portland bar and handed each attendee a crisp $10 bill that moolah was described as a small but symbolic gift a handout that was fueled mostly by white people who were of course asked not to attend after all the bar was designated as a safe space for visible minorities and on this night hongki's are two people of color what kryptonite I guess is to Superman however when it comes to the color prism brown hope loves it when white people pony up the green stuff for the black and brown and red people and amazingly they found about a hundred or so saps oh I mean philanthropists to contribute then again we are talking Portland Oregon America's unofficial progressive capital specializing in Caucasian guilt even so apparently a good time was had by all you see the brown black and indigenous people took great pleasure in discussing policy issues and planning potential action was there a game on that night I mean any game that is have to admit I would have loved to being in attendance for that segregated Mensa Club meeting but alas just look at my pale face only my money is welcome not me so I'll just have to imagine how those policy discussions went especially when the participants were on to their fifth budweiser now Cameron Witten is the twenty seven-year-old social justice warrior who organized the event ostensibly to raise money one ten dollar bill at a time for reparations to pay for the horror of slavery and of course continuing racial injustice now while slavery was eradicated more than a century and a half ago white privilege has proven to be one tough dragon to tame and here's what Whitten donning the persona of black Santa's he handed out those portraits of Alexander Hamilton had to say quote it was only ten dollars but when I saw them I saw their eyes light up what I saw there was that people felt like they were finally seen end quote and all it took was ten bucks like tell me folks could that possibly be the most condescending line of the year so far the idea that the eyes of people of color light up at the mere sight of a 10-spot gee if a Sawbuck makes these folks eyes light up just imagine what a thousand dollars would do actually you don't have to imagine if you're a fan of The Price is Right oh look at that cracker Bob Barker running away I always had a hunch that guy was a racist still there are so many questions to be raised when it comes to reparations happy hour for instance what's the deal with the Asians getting the short end of the stick here how come they're excluded from this hootenanny handout and who qualifies as indigenous after all Democratic demigod Elizabeth Warren is allegedly 1/32 Cherokee does she pass the sniff test for some of that subsidized sambuca and despite the obvious problem of using politically correct racism to somehow address bad racism of the past doesn't this scheme really trivialize the idea of reparations for people of color regardless of where you stand on the issue look I'm all for think tanks but what sort of intellectual discussion there's one glean from a drunk tank fueled by cheap alcohol along with a heaping helping of apartheid for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download the rebel media app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
