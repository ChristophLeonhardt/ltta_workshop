so what a lot of people don't realize is that the best time to actually negotiate a salary is when you get a new job so a lot of times we are so excited to be offered a new job that we forget that we can actually negotiate our salary or we forget that we're actually in a really good position to be able to do so that this company really wants us and that we're bringing a unique set of skills to the table and so I really recommend that you always negotiate your salary the other thing is your employer is expecting you to do this and so that was the other thing that I didn't realize when I was younger and I actually made this money mistake early on my first job in financial planning they made me an offer they're like we're gonna pay you you know $40,000 a year and I thought that I had won the lottery I know this is the most money that I had you know thought I just didn't even think that I would be earning that much money at 23 and I quickly said yes and was very excited about it but what was interesting is when I was getting into this profession he was around the height of the market so they had the budget to be able to offer me a competitive salary and then the stock market crashed and guess what our 401k match got taken away and then the next year salaries were flat and then the next year I switched jobs and was really trying to negotiate that new salary but because of the market downturn you know I got like a $2,000 raise but they weren't paying for my health insurance premiums anymore so I basically made about the same amount of money my first five years in the financial planning profession because they didn't negotiate that first salary and I really feel like I learned a lot from that experience and I don't want you to make the same mistake
