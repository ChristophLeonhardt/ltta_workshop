members of the house are furious considering the fact that the Senate failed to pass their version of a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act and representative Blake Farenthold from Texas made his frustrations clear while he was talking to a local radio show host by the name of Bob Jones in fact he was so frustrated that he decided to bring up the issue of possibly dueling senators who refused to vote in favor of the replacement plan he don't believe me hear what he had to say this is the fact that the Senate does not have the courage to do some of the things that every Republican in the Senate promised to do is just absolutely repugnant to me i yeah if the probably the only some of the people that are opposed to this they're some female senators from the Northeast if it was a guy from South Texas I might ask him to step outside and settle this Aaron Burr style okay so let's just clarify a couple things first of all the duel between Amber and Alexander Hamilton was one that involved guns so he's talking about shooting other Republicans and killing them so when we talk about violence we're talking about violence this guy's just talked about let's go shoot each other in the streets why did you bring our female senators that's from the Northeast that's not even true Susan Collins is from the Northeast Lisa Murkowski is from Alaska that our that's the northeast of Russia okay so he doesn't even have his facts straight of course and now a side note Farenthold looks like a human representation of Pepe the Frog okay and so here he comes all of a sudden like ha ha man a they didn't have the courage maybe we should shoot him and it's not a matter of courage it's a matter the date don't agree with you so Susan Collins there's a lot of things that I don't agree with her on I don't agree with 90% of her policies but in this case she thinks 22 million people losing health insurance sucks and she doesn't want to support that she's not as much of a monster as you are she thinks cutting money for Planned Parenthood is not the right way to go that would hurt a lot of women in and overall in the country and she's not in favor of that that doesn't mean she lacks courage she means she or she should be shot in the face is it a more courageous to actually represent the best interests of your you know voters and look out for them instead of just playing party politics and and siding with senators who you know are gonna vote against the best interests of their constituents I mean you're talking about courage I mean and then okay so there's that part of it right and then there's this like constant talk about shooting and things like that coming from the right and this is right after Scalise got shot and is still in the hospital are we gonna change our rhetoric ever or they just gonna continue on with this nonsense like oh you're such a tough guy like yeah I would take them outside and like go go out go after Aaron Burr style I can't even believe that he said that but maybe I should maybe I'm super naive this rhetoric just keeps getting worse and they think it's cute they think it's funny he thinks he's a tough guy one they said Oh Bernie Sanders that fall for the school is shooting but Bernie Sanders is espoused non-violence from day one and has said it a million times over right this guy can you imagine if Bernie Sanders said maybe we should shoot Republicans we disagree with Aaron Burr style well Republicans would latch on to that they wouldn't let it go it would be something that they would mention every single day until Bernie Sanders has you know you know left the building no longer has a political career that's the difference between Republicans and Democrats right Republicans know messaging they will use anything and everything for the purposes of their propaganda whereas Democrats will let stuff slide this guy talks about shooting people and he disagrees with politically not even from the other side the other political party but from his own party because they refuse to vote for something that goes against the best interest of their constituents guess what that's what lawmakers are supposed to do I know we're so far removed from that where lawmakers just vote based on corporate interests their donors and everything other than their constituents but actually give these Republican senators a lot of credit for their courage of representing their constituents instead of just signing with a political party and by the way those are the moderate Republican senators so so-called a couple of them right but actually conservative senators are the ones who killed the bill they said it was not it draconian enough they didn't say the use of words you're coding but they said no there should be more freedom more tax cuts for the rich and less Medicaid support so less coverage for Americans so and there were more men than women who voted that way or we're gonna vote that way in the Republican Party so again here's a Republican randomly picking out female Republican senators and going it's their fault when there's only two of them and there were so many more and the guys who killed it were senators Lee and Moran after they said they weren't gonna vote for it that's when it died but he doesn't focus on the guys he focuses on the women right and look I don't care what gender he focuses on John and I discussed this on a day when you were out the House is furious right now that they passed their version of a crappy health care replacement bill right and of course their asses are on the line as a result of that politically speaking and the Senate didn't do the same in the so they're like wait it's like okay so you're stupid enough to do it and now you're angry that senators weren't stupid enough to do it take responsibility for your own actions and if you think it's such a great bill then why aren't you incredibly proud of it you should if you actually believe in the bill you say like all those poor senators they're not going to get the political advantage I'm gonna get right but instead you know that your bill is a disaster and the American people hate it and in the last poll that I saw from a couple of days ago twenty percent are in favor of your bill 57% are against it that's almost a three to one large and that's how much they hate your bill you know who you should blame for that not anybody else you you voted for it because you wanted to get more tax cuts for your donors sad day for you that you put together a bill that everybody in the country hates that's not on anybody but you if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if
