JOHN CARTER look at the rebel I'm here with dr. John Lott from the Crime Prevention Research Center one of the most knowledgeable people I've ever interviewed on gun policy dr. what we're seeing a lot a lot of debate about this issue post parkland I don't want to see emotional knee-jerk reaction arey legislation do you think we're going to or is this a lot of bluster and things will remain status quo I think you're gonna see something passed and I think it's gonna get passed very quickly I think it's probably going to get passed before there's really much consideration about it what bullies he passed what do you feel gonna get this nicks fix bill passed which will be adding a lot more names to the next system you know I don't mind in principle adding more names to the mixed system the problem is we have this huge false-positive problem virtually everybody who get stopped is a false positive and if you don't fix that and there are simple things that we can do to fix it then but they're not going to do that because then the Democrats would get upset but it are their due process provisions in the next fix there's not I mean you can go and bring suit later on if you're being improperly stopped from buying a gun but it's something you have to do afterwards so there's no adjudication in there you're gonna have to go spend a lot of money on a lawyer and go on your own I mean you can always go and hire a lawyer to to do things but it's not it's not like what was originally in things like the terror watchlist ban on guns was to go and require that the government had to make a case had to show that they had at least probable cause to be able to ban you from which is a pretty low standard but the Democrats objected to that they didn't want to have any judicial review of the decisions bureaucrats made about who would be not eligible to own a gun and so that bill didn't go anyplace but this they want to get it passed and I'm sure the Democrats would go be upset about any judicial review requirements and so I don't think it's going to be in there so what are the new standards to be added to the next list well I mean some of the stuff that's reasonable if they want to have it so that if the military knows that somebody has mental disability you know they were involuntarily committed for mental illness that that would be reported to NICs or if they committed certain types of crimes that that would be reported to NICs you know I think the vast majority of cases they did report it but obviously there were a few cases where they messed up and didn't report it so there's going to be money for that and then there's a lot of money that would be available to the states to go and and add more names to the system so look I don't think the background checks are gonna reduce crime in any way but you know if it makes people feel better fine but at least fix the system I mean virtually everybody who gets stopped is a false positive there's no reason why we should be having that problem it could be easily fixed but my own belief is that law Democrats view that as a big plus for the system rather than you know a negative and I and I wish also the costs were dealt with and we're right next to Washington DC here cost $125 to do the background check on a private transfer of a gun in DC and you know who do they think they're stopping for me able to go and buy guns right legal gun owners paying $125 are not the ones committing crimes with the guns that's the point you're making right look if you believe it reduces crime and I don't but if you believe it reduces crime then you believe it reduces crime for everybody not just the very law-abiding person who goes out of their way to go and buy a gun and so you know pay for now general revenue there don't make the entire burden beyond beyond the law-abiding citizen who's doing the right thing there I couldn't agree more dr.
