1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,060
This is David Hogg.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,250
Press secretary for March for Our Lives.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,970
He's a survivor of the Parkland massacre,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,389
and he's become one of the most recognizable
faces

5
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:11,719
in the movement for gun control.

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,869
He's also probably one of the most vilified
people

7
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:15,429
in right-wing media right now.

8
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:16,650
It's literally been about six weeks,

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,740
and I'm already being compared to Hitler.

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,240
Google Hogg's name and you'll find sites accusing
him

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,750
of being a crisis actor, an FBI plant,

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,410
a brainwashed hate-monger, a fascist.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,950
I can't really even think of the top five

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,490
because there's about 50 million.

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,810
If I experienced even a fraction of that,

16
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,899
I would collapse into a puddle of soy milk.

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,100
But rather than crumbling under the pressure,

18
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,980
Hogg and his friends have flourished,

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,730
keeping their cause in the national spotlight

20
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,300
while repeatedly dunking on their critics.

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,200
So, David,

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,600
The guy, is it David Hogg? He started off as this balanced, nice kid.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,020
He's just now become

24
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,620
a real bomb thrower.

25
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,999
Someone like this I think isn't helping the
conversation.

26
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,399
To David six weeks ago, I would say

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,120
get some more coffee and get an external charger.

28
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,800
You're going to need it.

29
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,690
It's kind of hard to believe,

30
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,360
but just a few months ago,

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,960
David Hogg was a typical nerdy high school
kid.

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,130
A debater, his school's news director,

33
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,500
an amateur video producer.

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,080
And like any good nerd journalist,

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,750
Hogg knew a bit about the right-wing fever
swamp.

36
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,000
Before all of this, I did know who Alex Jones
was.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,900
I did know who Laura Ingraham was.

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, actually, I didn't know who Laura was.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,770
But I did know who Alex Jones was

40
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,700
because of all the insane things that he said

41
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,130
to the Sandy Hook survivors.

42
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,300
That background ended up coming in handy.

43
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,310
After the Parkland shooting, Hogg and his
friends

44
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,240
became central figures in the debate over
gun control.

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,170
And that made them prime targets

46
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,100
for the right-wing smear machine.

47
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,500
Forgive me if I don't want a lesson on

48
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,920
the Second Amendment from a 16-year-old.

49
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,500
You're too immature to carry a firearm,

50
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,340
you're too immature to make policy.

51
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,090
What a conceited, arrogant know-it-all.

52
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,510
It's hard not to just go after this kid.

53
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,750
Authoritarianism is always about youth marches.

54
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,620
These poor children, they have no soul.

55
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,250
Hogg is funded by George Soros,

56
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,150
a literal Nazi collaborator.

57
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,490
Honestly, I figured a lot more of our attacks

58
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,210
would be against our policies, not really
against me.

59
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,030
The most notable of these have been

60
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,560
the conspiracy theories.

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,060
On social media, right-wing conspiracy theories

62
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,440
going viral about David Hogg.

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,980
Falsely accused survivor David Hogg of being
a crisis actor.

64
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,200
That video was viewed more than 200,000 times

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,890
before it was taken down.

66
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,040
And when I ask Hogg about those,

67
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
he's visibly frustrated.

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
I literally interviewed people in the school

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,410
during the shooting thinking I was going to
fucking die.

70
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,420
I don't know how else to prove to these people

71
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,280
that I was there, because I was.

72
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,870
This is how the right-wing smear machine works:

73
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,530
by bombarding the target with a flood

74
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,010
of ridiculous but inflammatory personal attacks.

75
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,900
Victims can either ignore the smears

76
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,540
and risk becoming defined by them,

77
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,319
or they can try to respond, burning

78
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,250
a ton of time and energy trying to keep up

79
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,790
with each new attack.

80
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,530
Either way, the target’s original message
gets lost.

81
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,170
It's like a never-ending game of bullshit
whack-a-mole.

82
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,930
No matter what I show, it's always going to
be,

83
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,080
"Oh, that's false."

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,310
Or, "Oh, that..."

85
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,040
It's insane.

86
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,780
You can see the toll that trying to keep up

87
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,920
with all this stuff has taken on Hogg.

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,820
But then something happens.

89
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,540
Hogg catches himself.

90
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,760
And for the rest of the interview, he’s
way more relaxed.

91
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,500
They've gone from saying that I wasn't at
the school

92
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,490
at the time to saying that I'm a crisis actor

93
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,209
to saying that I'm a 27-year-old that has
a facelift

94
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,270
to saying that I'm actually 135 years old
and

95
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,680
that I'm a, like, shape-shifting lizard, essentially.

96
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,020
I mean, I don't know about you guys,

97
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,680
but last time I checked, getting a facelift

98
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,150
doesn't make your acting career any better.

99
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,650
So.

100
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,100
That moment, that "breathe,"

101
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,150
is really important.

102
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,459
Hogg realizes he's getting caught up in the
bullshit

103
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,319
and decides not to take the bait.

104
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,470
I'm a debate kid, and I've always been made
fun of

105
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,470
throughout my life.

106
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,959
I'm used to it, and a lot of us are too, sadly.

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,959
Yeah, I feel that.

108
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,020
If you continue to pursue whatever path

109
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,640
they're leading you down, which is a dead
end,

110
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,970
it's going to end up distracting you

111
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,970
and draining your resources,

112
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,970
and you don't need that.

113
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,099
Instead of playing whack-a-mole,

114
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,570
the Parkland students have chosen to pick
their battles,

115
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,520
engaging their trolls strategically.

116
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,160
One of the most notable ways they do this
is through humor.

117
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,690
Some of them called you actors.

118
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,590
Well, I am an actor, actually.

119
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,579
I’m in Spring Awakening right now.

120
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,479
We just joke around a lot, and that's how

121
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,880
we're dealing with a lot of this and kind
of coping

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,310
in some weird way.

123
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,720
Look at the Twitter feeds of many of the Parkland
survivors

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,820
and you'll find them using humor to respond
to their critics,

125
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,290
turning smears and conspiracy theories into
jokes

126
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,300
that get them thousands of retweets.

127
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,320
At this point, it's just, it's so stupid.

128
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,540
It is funny for all of us to witness the ridiculousness
of the situation.

129
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,720
Laughing it off is a coping mechanism, for
sure.

130
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,930
But Hogg says it's also a good PR move.

131
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,490
Laughing it off is great because it keeps
you in the news more.

132
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,410
Not only do you get a laugh but your followers
get a laugh,

133
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,770
and you get a follow too.

134
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,460
Laughing it off also works because

135
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,510
it lets students respond to their critics

136
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,250
without giving them too much credit.

137
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,420
When you're laughing, you're showing that
you don't care,

138
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,020
and it makes people realize how ridiculous
these individuals are,

139
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,840
because they're only going to be taken seriously

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,190
if you take them seriously.

141
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,690
That approach works well when you're dealing

142
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,340
with fringe commentators like Alex Jones,

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,030
people who are already ripe for mockery.

144
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,120
I don't want to see him kissing goblins.

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,660
Having political succubus with goblins.

146
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,760
Ingratiating goblins.

147
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,000
But sometimes the troll isn't some fringe
person you can laugh at.

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,780
Sometimes it's the host of a major television
talk show,

149
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,880
like Fox News's Laura Ingraham,

150
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,560
who in March decided to mock Hogg on Twitter

151
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,850
for getting turned down by a few colleges.

152
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,710
In cases like that, Hogg responds a little
differently.

153
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,330
I was actually sitting at dinner with my sister,

154
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,770
and I was thinking about it for a minute.

155
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,090
My friends have responded plenty; maybe I
just should lay off.

156
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,260
And then I'm like,

157
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,880
"Mmm, I'm too petty for that."

158
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Hogg responded by tweeting a list of Laura
Ingraham's advertisers,

159
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,880
and before long, he had tens of thousands
of retweets.

160
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,419
What's the one thing that's common in all
conflict?

161
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,419
Economics.

162
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,960
What does Laura care about more than anything?

163
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,199
Her $4 million salary.

164
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,550
Within 24 hours, major advertisers had

165
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,820
yanked their ads from Ingraham's show.

166
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,560
Ingraham publicly apologized "in the spirit
of Holy Week."

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,979
And Hogg got another round of earned

168
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,650
national media coverage for his cause.

169
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,370
What I want to get on from is the negativity
in this situation,

170
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,620
and I want to focus on what's ahead for our
movement.

171
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,080
You don't need to go after these people personally

172
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
because that's just immature,

173
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,550
and that's what they're trying to do to you.

174
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,320
Go after their advertisers and them making
money.

175
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,389
This is a David-and-Goliath story.

176
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,620
It appears David has won.

177
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
Before we ended our interview,

178
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,880
I asked Hogg what advice he'd give to other
activists,

179
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,889
especially students,

180
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,990
who might find themselves in the crosshairs

181
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,560
of the right-wing smear machine.

182
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,810
Whenever somebody calls you a dick or whatever,

183
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,040
just say, “I love you,” honestly.

184
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,270
That's what this world needs.

185
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,380
We don't need anybody else being super mean
to each other

186
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,270
like Laura was to me or anybody else.

187
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,210
Point out the few that are just absolutely
ridiculous,

188
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,580
and after that, people will start fighting
for you

189
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,639
because you shouldn't have to, obviously.

190
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,300
Yeah, they shouldn't.

191
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,610
It is deeply disturbing that teenagers

192
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,770
who survived a mass shooting have to worry

193
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,770
about how to deal with this stuff.

194
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,449
But under the weight of intense media attention
and pressure,

195
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,630
these students are putting on a master class

196
00:07:10,630 --> 00:00:00,000
in how to deal with bullies.
