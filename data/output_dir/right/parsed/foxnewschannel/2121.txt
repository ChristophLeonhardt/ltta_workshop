SEE WHAT HE SAYS THIS AFTERNOON.
JULIE?
>> PETER DOOCY LIVE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
EXPECTATIONS BUILDING FOR THE
RELEASE OF THREE AMERICANS
DETAINED IN NORTH KOREA AFTER
REPORTS THAT THEY WERE MOVED TO
A HOTEL.
THIS COMING AHEAD OF THE MEETING
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM
JONG-UN.
THE PRESIDENT JUST COMMENTING ON
THE TALKS A SHORT TIME AGO.
LISTEN.
>> WE'RE HAVING VERY SUBSTANTIVE
TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA AND A LOT
OF THINGS HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED
WITH RESPECT TO THE HOSTAGES.
I THINK YOU'LL SEE VERY GOOD
THING.
ALSO, THE TRIP IS BEING
SCHEDULED.
WE HAVE A DATE AND WE HAVE A
LOCATION.
WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING IT SOON.
>> Julie: GREG PALKOT JOINS US
LIVE.
HI, GREG.
>> THAT WAS A BREAKING
DEVELOPMENT ON THIS AND A COUPLE
OF STORIES FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IN HIS WORDS, I THINK YOU'LL SEE
VERY GOOD THINGS.
HE WAS REFERRING TO THE AMERICAN
CITIZENS HELD BY NORTH KOREA.
THAT INCLUDES KOREAN AMERICANS.
KIM DUNG CHUL AND KIM SANDOK.
THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF CRIMES
OF NORTH KOREA LIKE SPYING.
THERE'S BEEN REPORTS THAT THEY
WERE MOVED FROM A LABOR CAMP
AHEAD OF THEIR RELEASE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP REFERRING TO
SUBSTANTIVE TALKS REGARDING
THEIR RELEASE.
ALL OF THIS FOLLOWS LAST
FRIDAY'S IMPORTANT SUMMIT
BETWEEN NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM
JONG-UN AND SOUTH KOREAN
PRESIDENT MOON.
THE OTHER MAJOR NEWS THAT YOU
JUST HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS THAT A DATE AND LOCATION FOR
HIS SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN HAS
BEEN DECIDED UPON.
HE DIDN'T SAY RIGHT NOW WHEN OR
WHERE.
A LEADING POSSIBILITY FOR
LOCATION FOR THE SUMMIT IS IN
FACT THE SAME LOCATION AS LAST
FRIDAY'S MEETING, THE DMZ
BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA.
SINGAPORE IS ONE OF SEVERAL
OTHER POSSIBILITIES.
AS FOR THE TIME, IT'S BEEN
REPORTED LATE MAY OR EARLY JUNE.
FINALLY, A LOT TO COVER HERE.
TWO FINAL NOTES.
ONE AGAIN FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE BASICALLY KNOCKED DOWN A
REPORT THAT WAS IN "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING
REDUCING U.S. TROOPS STRENGTH IN
SOUTH KOREA.
THAT WAS A VERY CRUCIAL CLAIM.
BUT HE SAID, MAYBE LATER ON
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
ONE BREAKING NEWS COMING FROM
SOUTH KOREA.
QUOTING AN UNNAMED SOURCE, THE
IMPORTANT NEWS AGENCY THERE,
SAYING THAT DETAINEE RELEASE
COULD HAPPEN AS EARLY AS
SATURDAY AND COULD HAPPEN, GUESS
WHAT?
AT THE DMZ.
