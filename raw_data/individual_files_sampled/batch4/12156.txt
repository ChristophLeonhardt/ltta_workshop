so you remember that time an anti LGBT activist attended a Hillary Clinton rally and then tried to grab a cop's gun to shoot Hillary Clinton neither do i cuz it didn't happen you remember that time an illegal immigrant went to a Donald Trump rally and tried to grab a cop's gun to shoot Donald Trump you probably don't it happened on Saturday according to the Associated Press his prospective assassin was an illegal immigrant he'd overstayed his visa from the United Kingdom this would be John and John Wilkes Booth told the cops that he drove all the way from California to Vegas to kill Donald Trump this however has not spurred a national conversation about whether leftist rhetoric drives violence in fact it'll probably drive the media to question whether Trump did something to provoke the perpetrator just as they have every time anti Trump rioters riot and trying her pro Trump people they ask whether it's Trump's fault it's actually amazing everything bad in the universe happens because of conservatives if a Muslim who says he is a Muslim commits a terrorist act the media come up with an alternative narrative in which white Christians are responsible if a British mental case with right-wing associations kills a left-wing politician the media immediately declared a political killing if someone without any political affiliation commits an act of violence against school children or theatre goers or a congresswoman the media blame the NRA or Sarah Palin presumably the only reason this particular British illegal immigrant would want to kill Trump then is because Trump had it coming or maybe the network media will just continue to ignore the attempted assassination after all it's kind of inconvenient for their anti right wing story I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show tends to demonize people don't care about your feelings so here we are and it's a new day you should subscribe by the way at daily wired.com so you can see all of the magical things that

so basically were an online pornography site is what I'm trying to tell you no we're not in Lindsey no or not we're not going to do any of those things okay so Lindsay is too good a person to do those things all right well maybe okay so okay so today it's a new day and that means that it's time for the Democrats to grab your guns all over again it's just a romantic brand-new day so yesterday there are four different gun control measures that are brought up on the floor of the Senate - from Democrats - from Republicans the - from Democrats one is sponsored by Dianne Feinstein this is a measure that would require that anyone who's been on the terror watch list in the last five years they have to take five years after you're off the terror watch list before they will allow you to buy a gun which is called destruction of due process of law in this country you actually have to be proved guilty of something before we can just take away your rights your second Amendment rights why we can't just decide to put you on the terror watch list and jonah goldberg has been on the terror watch list and Teddy Kennedy was on the terror watch list which actually makes sense since he killed a woman but Jonah Goldberg didn't and the and the idea here is that the left doesn't believe that you should have to show any evidence that I'm a bad person or even a terrorist or they're no there's no evidence of criminality necessary in order for you to take away my rights so we'll start with Dianne Feinstein her her amendment was voted down yesterday listen carefully to what Diane Feinstein said on PBS newshour about Americans and what rights they have is pretty amazing the argument that many of your Republican colleagues have made about this is that there is still the potential that people who are innocent are on a watch list and they would be prevented from buying a gun well then you can petition and prove that you're innocent and get off of the watchlist but you know if we want to prevent this you know that this bill was drafted actually during the Bush administration when a man a terrorist went back to Syria and American and said to everybody now exploit the loopholes in America's laws and you buy weapons well this is we've got huge loopholes and it's wrong and we've got to begin to close them one by one by one the terrorist bill no guns for terrorists is a first step assault weapons is a second step this man should not it's relevant is where Dianne Feinstein you may have mistakes it's kind of quick there's part of this where Dianne Feinstein actually dropped the line and it's pretty amazing she actually dropped the line that you can always prove yourself innocent you can appeal improve yourself innocent well I wasn't aware that in the United States you have to prove yourself innocent in order to exercise your rights I thought that you're innocent until proven guilty under the Due Process Clause of the of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution I thought that that was sort of the the basis of all criminal justice in the United States as the government has to prove something before they can take away a right Dianne Feinstein reverses the polarity and she suggests that she can take away her rights just because she feels like it and this is the entire Democratic move now jeanne Shaheen Democrat from North from New Hampshire she was on the radio and she says that anyone who wants to buy an ar-15 the only reason you possibly want to buy an ar-15 is because you want to do bad things with it I mean is that if we can't even expand background checks or expand the list you know people who can buy weapons how is it possible that we could ever even make ground when it comes to the types of guns that people own well I think people need to have their voices heard and what I've heard from people in New Hampshire is that they think there's reasonable legislation that we can pass including things like looking at the types of weapons that are so easy for people to get you know the fact is the ar-15 the gun that Mateen used that's a weapon of war it's advertised as being able to do technologically advances in killing people that previous weapons have been unable to do and somebody who's buying that kind of a weapon isn't buying it for target shooting they're not buying it to go out and hunt deer you don't need an ak-47 or an ar-15 to hunt deer they're buying it to do bad things and we need to recognize that and address it ok so she says then the only person the only people who want to buy an ar-15 are people who are violent and want to do terrible things to you ok well we in the office have a gal named Candice and Candice is a lovely person who also happens to be at 100 pounds soaking wet if that and she looks more like 90 to me and Candice is and Candice is like a champion marksman with an ar-15 she just came in third and I think it was a statewide competition shooting the ar-15 is that because she's a cold-blooded killer she's gonna go to a gay nightclub and start shooting people up or is it because she wants to be proficient with a rifle because it turns out that there are plenty of reasons you'd want to be proficient with the rifle ranging from home defense to defense against tyranny which actually maintains yeah that's why the founders wanted you to have a gun to hunting there are plenty of reasons but according to the left there's no good reason so we've now heard a couple of excuses from the left for gun control one is that they don't actually have to prove you guilty you have to prove yourself innocent which by the way is called proving a negative you can't do that there's no way to prove yourself innocent of anything and if I say to you you three three years ago sometime that year you raped a small child and then the Impa the onus is on you to prove yourself innocent you have to prove where you were every minute of the day for three years ago that entire year right there's no way to prove yourself innocent you can't prove a negative so that's number one number two anyone who buys an ar-15 is evil and terrible of course nonsense and finally the Democrats come in right out and say it and they just say well the Republicans just want to sell weapons directly to Isis so Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut he comes out and he says this in an interview at The Washington Post he says that's what they've decided to do he says Republicans have decided to sell weapons to Isis Isis has decided the assault is the new airplane and Republicans in refusing to close the terror gap refusing to pass bans on assault weapons are allowing these weapons to get in the hands of potential lone wolf attackers we've got to make this connection and make it in very stark terms so it's our fault it's our fault because the terrorists are getting weapons first of all I thought until 24 hours ago Democrats weren't allowed to mention Isis right they were doing the omitted routine if we mentioned Isis they were telling us we can't mention Isis because that increases terrorism but I guess that's exciting now they get to now they get to tell us that that Isis exists so that's that's good but if we're gonna talk about people who actually gave weapons to Isis we have to start with the Democrats I wrote a book last year called the People vs Barack Obama and in it there's a section from the book quote on March 30th 2011 ABC News reported that President Obama had secretly signed a presidential finding to send covert aid to the Al qaeda-linked rebels the same day as the ABC news report the Washington Post announced an Obama secret finding including an authorization to the CIA to carry out a clandestine effort to provide arms and other support to Libyan opposition groups as you recall that would include terrorist groups libyan terrorist groups began receiving arms shipments and money from qatar so if you want to talk about who's arming Isis who made Isis powerful the only people who did that were Democrats as Democrats who actually gave guns to Isis who actually gave guns to al-qaeda that would be that'd be the Democrats but no it's our fault and now you've got the White House defending Chris Murphy on this saying yeah these evil Republicans all they want to do is give guns to terrorists right right like we wanted to give guns to the gay people to kill the terrorists but we all we're the ones want to give guns to terrorists here's Josh earnest the miss named Josh earnest Thomas Roberts I just want to ask you about what Senator Murphy of Connecticut had to say about the Republicans and the fact that we've got to make this clear the constant case the Republicans have decided to sell weapons to Isis is that how President Obama feels in light of the fact that we saw these measures fail well Thomas I think what is clear is that there are individuals in the United States right now that that our law enforcement officials are concerned could have ties to terrorism could be are susceptible to being radicalized by the online our recruitment efforts of ISIL and right now there is not a law on the books that prevents those individuals from walking into a gun store and buying a gun so does the president specifically blame Republicans for failure in acting and in doing so that allows Isis to buy assault weapons look it's a pretty open-and-shut case it is clear that Republicans have refused to act on a common-sense measure that would prevent individuals with suspected ties to terrorism from being able to buy a gun right now those individuals who we have concluded our too dangerous to board an airplane can walk into a gun store and buy a gun that doesn't make any sense and why Republicans allow that to happen is just beyond me it makes no sense and what's Josh earnest you factor in the fear that they have in the NRA so it's the only the NRA the evil evil terrible NRA so in Orlando jihadis too by the way expressed his support for Hillary Clinton in this presidential race it's the NRA s fault that that guy was able to get a gun it's worth noting I mentioned there were four different gun measures that were up right - from the Democrats there also - from the Republicans the - from the Republicans would have added the ability for mental health to be added to the designation of whether somebody ought to get a weapon the other one was the 72-hour hold if you're on the terror watch list so the government now has 72 hours to prove you guilty before they before they can deny you sale of a weapon Democrats voted against both of those things the Democrats decided not to push any form of gun control demonstrating once again that day I guess Democrats want terror terrorists to have weapons I guess that's what Democrats want they want terrorists to have weapons so this is all nasty ridiculous stuff from Democrats and it's really gross all of which means that Donald Trump should be pummeling them II should be pummeling them right now right me now is the time now if anytime or the time it now would be the time so it's time to do our daily episode of good trump bad Trump good Trump bad Trump yeah everybody looks good Trump bad Trump okay so we'll start with good Trump and then we will get to bad Trump so good Trump Donald Trump attacks Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren has been going out there saying crazy things Elizabeth Warren and Democrats they've been tweeting out this hashtag I think it's disarmed hate which I have to have to acknowledge that when when I saw the hashtag disarm hate I immediately flashed to Monty Python and the Holy Grail and the black night being disarmed today also what if hate knows jujitsu I mean have they thought of that one I mean disarmed hate what if what if hate is is a jujitsu master that you gotta really think this thing through so they've been pushing out this disarmed hate stuff and Elizabeth Warren has been hitting Donald Trump very hard and in Donald Trump reads the smoke signals and then he and he's asked about calling her Pocahontas which he calls her mockingly and here's his answer do you regret calling her Pocahontas do you regret that I do I do regret calling up O'Connor's because I think it's a tremendous insult to focus on her separate so the Pocahontas I would like to apologize to you okay this is a funny bit and he continues along these lines he's asked by Bill O'Reilly about President Obama he hit hinted last week as you recall the President Obama was secretly it was secretly a lot allied with with Isis that he knew something the rest of us didn't know Oh Riley asks him about this and Trump does a good job I don't think you believe that he's a Quisling that he's someone who is wants Islamic terrorism to prosper you don't believe that do you I don't believe it I do say though when I see a deal like was made with Iran this horrible horrible deal where we're giving them back a hundred and fifty billion dollars to the best of my knowledge and I tell you what I've studied that thing pretty closely we're getting almost nothing out of it they can end up within nuclear weapons and lots of other things whatever they want and then I see the way he treats Israel I say wow what's the this seems to be a double standard I'm not happy about it a lot of other people aren't happy about it I can tell you the people in Israel are not happy about it so I look at things and I see what's going on and I'm a common-sense person and I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it one bit okay so oh that's fine and all of its good okay so that was good Trump and then we got bad drum so bad Trump is um yesterday we mentioned that Donald Trump head had tossed his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and I just wanted to recall this is Donald Trump on Corey Lewandowski back in March when when Corey Lewandowski was under suspicion of having grabbed a reporter Michelle fields and bruised her arm and here was Donald at the time I know it'd be very easy for me to discard people I don't discard people I stay with people that's why I stay with this country that's why I stay with a lot of people that are treated unfairly and that's one of the reasons I'm the front-runner by a lot okay so he says he always sticks with people even if they're treated especially if they're treated unfairly fast forward to yesterday Donald Trump fires Corey Lewandowski and then he's on TV and here's what he has to say now he's out what happened he's a good man we've had great success you know I got more primary votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party by a tremendous amount not by a little bit I think Corey's terrific I watched him before he was terrific toward me said I was a talented person and he's a talented person he's a good guy he's a friend of mine but I think it's time now for a different kind of a campaign we ran a small beautiful well unified campaign and worked very well in the primaries I think I'm probably going to do some of that I want to keep it a little bit very much in control as an example I have 73 people Hillary Clinton has like almost 900 people and we're in the same position so you know there's something nice about that I got criticized for that I said wait a minute I've spent much less money than her and the results so far is the same I should be credited for that but with Corey I'm really proud of him he did a great job but we're gonna go a little bit of a different realm so the difference it's a different style and you're bringing in there rumors flying all day yesterday the cordon lewandowski's meowstic cuz he's doing poorly in the polls Trump is Corey lewandowski's ousted because the family doesn't like him in a rally she says they're not so long with Donald Trump by the way that that answer was nonsensical why are you getting rid of Corey Lewandowski he's a great guy so why are you getting rid of him well listen we ran a really slim campaign like a campaign with only 70 people and I think that that's the way we ought to run a campaign so why are you getting rid of him well he's a great guy okay then I guess so Corey Lewandowski is is on TV to talk about this and Corey Lewandowski has to have some sort of non-disclosure agreement with with the Trump campaign and so you're gonna see Corey Lewandowski go full man sure in candidate here Donald Trump is the kindest gentlest warmest most wonderful human being he's ever met in his life it's kind of amazing what happened to that loyalty Trump said he doesn't discard members of his team no it's not it's not a question of loyalty that's not the question honest enough and I'm loyal to him and you know the decision to to build the campaign bigger and broader is is it is a good decision because you want to take on the the Clinton juggernaut what we have been able to do was a good decision I didn't say that what I said is my philosophy has been smaller and leaner and more efficient and ensuring that our resources are spent as best as possible and there are people who think that building a bigger broader coalition a bigger broader campaign to compete with the full-time staff of 732 paid people on the Clinton campaign is the right direction and that's perfectly fine so what in particular is the reason that you're being fired right now the loss in Iowa can't be the reason why look Peter I don't really want to get into the specifics of the boat what I think is fair to say is that I've had the privilege of being part of something which is much bigger than any one individual and the opportunity to move this campaign forward is something that's very important that is a dude with a nondisclosure agreement right there it gets osted and he's sitting there still talking on the talking points from the Trump campaign Wow I mean the Trump campaign could have sidelined him they could have made him a they could have kept paying him as a consultant or something instead they just fired him and have him escorted from the building and he's still mouthing these platitudes so that's that's bad from the worst Trump worst Trump is what happened last night so the term campaign is just not competent okay they're just not competent so yesterday I mentioned this yesterday morning that fired Corey Lewandowski and I say okay why do they fight him on a Monday morning if you're gonna do this right you fired him on a Friday afternoon like 4:30 in the afternoon nobody has time to react we talked about how rejiggering the campaign over the weekend you come back next weekend it's all fresh so they fire him instead on a Monday so people are saying oh maybe that's manna fort Paul manna for the new campaign manager kind of sinking his hooks into Lewandowski maybe it's Ivanka who wants it clear that she's now in charge okay whatever Monday night Monday night the new Federal Elections Commission report on the Trump campaign comes out this is the new new information about Donald Trump's Donald Trump's campaign and this is legitimately Lou shittim Utley the worst financial report any presidential candidate in modern history has ever put out I mean it is awful so just as background Trump is talking to O'Reilly talking up the fact I have a slim campaign and I'm running even with Hillary first of all dude you're not running even with Hillary you're running six to six somewhere between six and ten points in the polls behind Hillary Clinton you're running about even with Hillary in Ohio you're running a little behind her in Pennsylvania you're getting beat by eight in Florida you're starting to lose Arizona you're starting to lose Kansas and you're starting to lose Utah and it's it's not if you want to close that gap you would assume okay fine drop some money of your own right I mean Trump said back in 2011 that he was gonna dump six hundred million dollars of his own money into the campaign and that sounds like a lot of money unless you were ten billion but if you're a ten billion you have ten billion in assets and you spend six hundred million dollars proportionately speaking that's if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year and you take six thousand and spend it on something it's a lot of money but it ain't the end of the world right from has ten billion six hundred million is a lot of money it ain't the end of the world so far Trump has lent his campaign he didn't give his campaign he lent his campaign that means that he says to the campaign here's some money when other money comes in you have to repay it back to me he's lent his campaign somewhere in the neighborhood of forty million dollars this is the equivalent to a ten billion dollar guy this is the equivalent of a one hundred thousand dollar asset owner spending four hundred dollars on something right like a nice dinner it's like one nice dinner and he can't spend more than that on his own campaign okay fine Donald Trump she has now spent twenty three million dollars reserving ad time in Nevada Colorado Iowa Ohio Florida North Carolina Virginia and New Hampshire Donald Trump has spent this many dollars zero he has been zero dollars not one zero okay he's not reserved any ad time in this wing state he has seventy national campaign employees she has well over 700 that's the tip of the iceberg so here's the bad news in the latest federal election commission's report from the Trump campaign and this is just devastating this is bad Trump this is bad Trump at its finest so among other problems Donald Trump he clinched the nomination as you recall May 30 clinched it right after Indiana Ted Cruz dropped out it was obvious he was the nominee you would imagine that in the month of May he would do some pretty heavy lifting in terms of fundraising right to get on the phone he'd make some calls he'd get people to give money he was obviously the nominee they were consolidating around him and I can tell you gang is somebody who's very plugged into all of the various kind of conservative media outlets I can tell you that there is an absolute effort top-down effort at lots of conservative media outlets to push Donald Trump to tell people who are anti Donald Trump that they ought to jump aboard the Trump train this is a real thing that's happening all across the conservative media spectrum it's not unique to one any one company but it is definitely happening it is definitely happening in to all the people I'm talking to it's it's definitely happening so Trump had his shot right in the last six weeks he had a shot to consolidate to raise lots of money so you would figure he would do great last month right he finally locks this thing up we're gonna get presidential Trump well in May Donald Trump raises a grand total of 3.1 million dollars now by way of contrast Mitt Romney who'd sewn it up a little bit later than Trump right by contrast Mitt Romney in the month of May May 2012 Mitt Romney raised seventy eight million dollars seventy eight million dollars Hillary Clinton in the month of May even though she's still battling she only finished off Bernie Sanders in California in June in the month of May Hillary Clinton raised twenty eight million dollars Donald Trump raised 3.1 million dollars in May 3.1 million dollars okay that is sad sack crap I mean that is bad news and there are a couple of reasons for that one is that he's an erratic candidate people don't want to put their money behind him two is that they don't think that Trump is wealthy and they don't think he's gonna put his own money behind himself one of two things is true for Trump right either he's inordinate ly wealthy but he doesn't think he's gonna win until he's not dumping his money into his campaign or in that wealthy in which case he's not gonna be able to self-fund in which case he's got a problem and half of his case for being the nominee is basically gone Ted Cruz who stopped running at the beginning of May he stopped running at the beginning of May he has six point eight million dollars cash on hand Donald Trump raised 3.1 million dollars and then he spent two million of it and he has 1.3 million dollars cash on hand there are state Senate candidates in this country who have more cash on hand than that that's question one why can't you raise any money question two where did all the money go well let's explore shall we so Donald Trump spent one third of all campaign expenditures on his own firms and travel reimbursements for his children as right gang you gave Donald Trump money and he then took the money and spent it on his own properties he spent it on his own kids right this is called a scam he spent four hundred and twenty three thousand three hundred and seventeen dollars to rent a facility right for his campaign which facility did he rent he rented mar-a-lago which he owns he paid himself four hundred thirty grand to rent the facility he already owns in which he could donate as an in-kind contribution he spent three hundred fifty thousand dollars on tag air but you asked who owns tag air oh that's right it's Trump it's Trump Trump owns tagger I don't know what tag stands for must be like Trump air great he even spent $4,000 on wines from his sons wine company okay Donald Trump spent $200,000 $200,000 on hat unhatched I mean that it's like the Kentucky Derby over there dude loves hats he's got stacks and stacks and make America great again hats sitting somewhere Trump paid himself a salary he paid himself a salary now if you're really really SuperDuper wealthy would you pay yourself a salary from your campaign revenue would you do that I wouldn't my favorite thing in here is that the Trump campaign signed a $35,000 check to an advertising firm called Draper sterling what you ask is Draper sterling well for those of you who have seen Mad Men you know that Don Draper and Roger Sterling are two of the main characters in Mad Men it's an advertising firm that doesn't exist it's Fritz it's currently registered at a residential address in New Hampshire people are tracking this down it looks basically like a buddy of Corey lewandowski's may have been funneled a bunch of money for basically nothing that's that's what it that's what it sort of looks like how about but but but you say okay so Trump isn't raising a lot of money for himself directly but he's for sure raising a lot of money for like the RNC the RNC says no we're raising all that money ourselves and you might say well you know when we say Romney raised 78 million he didn't raise 78 million just directly for his campaign you raised a bunch for his super PAC right that's it so how much need raised for a super PAC the great America PAC which is the greatest of all Trump super PACs it's huge they raised one point four million dollars in May they have half a million dollars cash on hand half a million dollars cash on hand I could take a personal loan against my home value for that amount buddy right now today okay this is crazy towns this is crazy towns Trump is not competent and this raises some questions this raises some questions and it raises one big question which is for all you people out there who are saying well you have to sacrifice principle to oppose Hillary after sacrifice principle to back Trump okay that logic works if Trump is gonna win or if he has a shot at winning what if Trump gets creamed what if you sacrificed your principles to watch a guy just get absolutely shellacked and just get crushed this is a real consideration and coming up to the convention there are now stories in The Washington Post there's some concern among delegates there may be a delegate revolt against Trump and there are a lot of questions to be asked here is Donald Trump even that wealthy Mark Cuban today he says you know if Donald Trump were that wealthy he just signed himself a 200 million dollar check I could do it intra in manding Cubans worth like a couple billion dollars why not just sign himself a 200 million dollar check he says I don't think he's weren't that much money Trump isn't doing it obviously he's also not releasing his tax returns but his kind of stingy stingy material for a dude who's supposedly worth 10 billion dollars second question does Trump even want to win at this point right if Trump really is that wealthy wizened he's spending the money maybe he thinks he's going to lose and maybe he would prefer to blame everybody else maybe he thinks that he is not going to win this campaign and so instead of spending his money on his campaign he's just gonna spend his money elsewhere he's gonna up his brand and then he's gonna go do other things after he's done which would kind of fit the mo right now he's busy blaming Republicans right I mean Donald Trump is out there blaming Republicans for his campaign most people like me it's my fault that Donald from sucks at campaigning it's not my fault that Donald Trump isn't signing himself a check it's his money I saw my fault that Donald Trump isn't calling up donors political reported last week quote in recent days RNC Chairman Reince Priebus has privately grumbled his advice doesn't seem welcome with Trump while Trump had promised previous he would call two dozen GOP donors when RNC chief of staff Katie Walsh recently presented Trump with a list of more than 20 donors he called three before stopping according to two sources familiar with the situation but according to trump it's all of our faults it's my fault it's Paul Ryan's fault it's Ryan's previous fault here's Donald Trump on Fox and Friends saying just that I need support from the Republicans I mean in some ways they get more support from the Democrats that do the Republicans some of the Republicans not all some have been phenomenal I don't want to build that up in one way because I have got so much tremendous support from congressmen and from senators and from lots of other people but we do need support and by the way rights and the RNC have been terrific but it would be nice to have full support from people that are in office I mean full verbal support he's saying that Paul Ryan there obviously is passive aggressive it'd be so nice if everybody would just get behind me and shut up I'm old enough to remember five minutes ago when he was saying he didn't need Republicans and he could do it all on its own and the Republicans are running screaming from him because not only does he say stupid things but he doesn't have the capacity to run a campaign again the reason folks the reason that I'm going after Trump here is because I think it's important to do a couple things want to be honest but too I think it's important to recognize that the anti-establishment notion we need to get rid of the Republican establishment doesn't mean you also get rid of every capacity to win it doesn't relieve you of the burden of having to run a real campaign just shouting cuck online over and over and over and know when you a campaign yeah I understand they're a bunch of people online or like small children watching Peter Pan they think that if they clap for Tinker Bell Tinker Bell lives well if you shout cuck enough I'm gonna make Trump the president Trump actually has to do the legwork he actually has to do the things he needs to do and what's very frustrating about this is the worse a campaign Trump runs the more the establishment wing of the Republican Party looks at the rest of us we're anti-establishment even anti Trump anti-establishment people like me they look at us and say well you guys just aren't professional I mean this is humiliating I don't like Trump right I don't not gonna vote for him but the fact is Hillary is highly vulnerable she's super vulnerable and Trump I mean we said this yesterday Trump is blowing it and he's blowing it every single day and Republicans who even support Trump are now running from him okay the New York Times contacted a bunch of top Republicans in his kind of hilarious they contacted a bunch of top Republicans because they wanted to get comment and these were top Republicans were afraid that they would be asked about Trump here are their responses Lindsey Graham says to the reporter as his spokesperson says he sort of had his fill talking about Trump Perry who backs Trump thanks for thinking of him Ted Cruz it's not great timing on our end Mitt Romney your kind to think of me Chris Christie we are going to take a pass this time Charlie Baker of Massachusetts the governor won't be available Mike Lee of Utah senator Lee would love to talk to you about the state of the GOP and conservatism in general we are free anytime after November 8th you have to love it you have to love the stones on that one okay so there was already asked a couple of questions one is does Trump one win to his Trump even that wealthy third is Trump even a good businessman his entire pitch was he's a great businessman he's gonna come in he's gonna revitalize the economies can do a wonderful job because he's so good at business he can't even put together a team he can't even put together a team his team is chaos we talked about this yesterday with Lewandowski it's absolute chaos inside finally is this all a scam are you all being played is this just a giant scam and I think this is important to discuss did you fall for a scam did a lot of people fall for a scam and son you just cuz you back Trump there are a lot of people who fall for for politicians scams but this is pretty bad and there's speculation mounting in recent weeks that the only reason Trump ran in the first place was to enhance his brand viability but this fundraising report really kind of puts that on the table his fundraising report puts it puts the Trump campaign behind the eight-ball now Trump is saying well recover will be fine he put out a statement where he said that our fundraising has been spectacular this month I don't know what to believe I don't know whether to believe that or not I mean he was saying that his fundraising was spectacular last month that he was getting all sorts of support all of which is to say if you want to win it requires two things yes you have to be a fighter but two you also have to be a professional too you also have to be a professional and if Trump isn't gonna be a professional it's gonna be very difficult for him to win this election it's gonna be very brutal for him to win this election I think that this this is going to be an object lesson for Republicans going forward first do I think I think it's important to answer the question as to whether I think Trump should be ousted by the party at the convention let's put it this way if you want to win in 2016 yeah he should be ousted trumping gonna win head Trump's gonna get killed he's gonna get killed because he hasn't he can turn this sucker around Trump is still Trump now if Trump could turn this around it would a minor miracle but if Trump turned this around imagine this if Trump is behind six points right now and he's spending no money what would happen if he actually dumped a bunch of money into his own campaign and stop making gaffes he might be competitive he might actually be able to win but he's not gonna do any of those things so should they should they dump him I don't know I don't know if they should dump him I mean I'll be honest with you if they dump him right now before the convention there's the real possibility that Donald Trump then complains about it all the way till the election the Republicans lose and the and the Trump win comes back in four years I mean Trump's it's funny to say this but he's 70s not 80 Trump could come back in four years and do this all over again just to make a fuss about I don't think he would but but it's possible that he could he could do this all over again his movement certainly would live on if you let him haven't you let him get creamed then people have to live with the with the decisions that they make but the good from bad Trump dichotomy I don't think that's going to end anytime soon and it obscures the fact that Hillary is terrible on everything that she's awful and the media are just dying for her they are dying for her there's a there's a Chiron today on MSNBC that was the craziest Chiron I've ever seen okay actually yeah a ton MSNBC okay it's Hillary Clinton speaking she's running a flag and it says Clinton breaking news ready for this is what it says on TV Clinton speaking for first time as grandmother of two that's what the chyron says and you think the media are going soft on Hillary you bet the media are going soft on Hillary the only way to fight that is to go directly to the population the only way to go directly to the population is to spend some money trumpet and doing that and so Trump's in real trouble here and it's and it just goes to show you all the people who jumped aboard the Trump bandwagon even the last couple of weeks all the people who jumped aboard in the last couple of weeks to try and to try and consolidate behind Donald Trump if he's if he's you know if he's raiding his own campaign coffers in order to pay his family you're being scammed I mean that's that's scuzzy stuff it really is it's pretty scuzzy stuff okay time for a couple of things I like and then some things that I hate okay things that I like so I just started watching the series I haven't finished it I know Clavin recommended it also but the first couple episodes are really good the night manager on AMC the Tom Hiddleston and and was it a Hugh Hugh Laurie the guy from house and and it's it's very compelling TV it's it's it's a spy thing it's a it's a John McCrae I believe this house pronounced is based on one of his novels and and here's what the trailer looks like spectator sport our impressive Road what do you want miss Berg I want to make you an offer bring down Richard Roeper I want to put you inside his operation my name is fine I'm the night manager two eyes we did you back there boy you will be in so deep you're worried that you'll never get out I've nothing to lose you saved my boy welcome to the family come into our lives after we just need you will need the university the open-air care of interest as murder theft everyone sickness Tom Gardner I star I think he might be playing both sides he needs Richard Roeper Cirie's yeah I've only watched the first couple excuse me of episodes and they're there they're very good they're very well produced and it's Tom Hiddleston auditioning for James Bond which apparently he's gonna be the new James Bond so it's it's really good I will say the one thing that bugs me is it's amazing how Hollywood goes out of its way every villain in Hollywood must be a white male all of them there can never be anybody who's not a white male villain in any of these spy stories particularly so this whole thing is about how how house after being a doctor and healing his leg house has become an arms dealer and and so now he's selling arms and it's and he's the bad guy because he's the arms dealer and and Hollywood loves to bash the arms dealers which is fine and dandy but the reality is the people on the other end who are using the guns are more of a problem the same way that Hollywood likes to bash the the gun shops instead of bashing the jihadists in this case these are illegal gun sales but there's one point in one of the early episodes where they're talking about the Arab Spring and they're talking about shutting him down because he's an arms dealer and the British government knows about him and they say well we don't really necessarily want to shut him down because he may be arming the people who are going to be fighting the religious fanatics and this is sort of dismissed right this is sort of dismissed like oh that's so terrible how could they possibly think that well if you recall history the Arab Spring did not end well in Egypt Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood took over the country and then the generals came back in and took back over the country probably with the help of arms dealers like the bad guy in this particular series so it's it's you know the the it's funny Hollywood likes to pretend that it sees shades of grey and politics but but really how I would only sees you should black and white and the black and white is white people are the villains and brown people are not so if you have to brown people one of whom is bad and one of whom is good the brown bad guy is not really the bad guy it's the white bad guy right and at the very beginning this isn't giving anything away in the first episode the Tom Hiddleston sleeps with a girl and in she ends up being killed and it's and she's killed by an Arab guy she's killed by a Muslim guy who's a bad guy right Tom Hiddleston doesn't set his sights on that guy Tom Hiddleston sets his sights on Richard Roeper who's the who's the arms dealer the white arms dealer that's the guy who really has to be taken down as opposed to this guy who's part of this really rich Muslim family in Egypt why no one really explains but you know there you have it so okay other things that I like Daniel Radcliffe who I've been told I bear a resemblance I don't see it at all certainly not with the beard but when he was I think that I've gotten the Harry Potter routine a couple of times and Daniel Radcliffe was on with one of the least funny people in America Seth Meyers and Seth Meyers asked him about one time that he met Donald Trump and it's a little bit funny then I heard is this true your first talk show appearance you're very young you meet Donald Trump backstage yes yeah I I was a true story yes it was my first time in New York and I was doing The Today Show and I was like really nervous and 10 or 11 years old and like never been on live TV before and just terrified and they said and he was a guest on it and presumably somebody went up to him it was like you want to meet the kid that plays Harry Potter and he was like yeah and they're all probably with less enthusiasm arch me over to him and and I remember saying like having some idea of who he was but not really know full concept and I said I was just like oh he was like how are you I was I'm really nervous I don't know what I'm gonna talk about on the show and he just said you just tell them you met mr. Trump which I was just like I to this day I'm like I can't even relate to that level of confidence but imagine if like imagine if like I said to Billy I was just like I'll just talk about me when you do your don't worry about to be everyone's store right yeah you just got interviewed and laughs yeah I just like that's how it worked he was here and you met him and also just like how weeded out would they be for like that young British kid so yeah that's it that's funny stuff but it's also a little bit telling about Trump / Trump everything revolves around Trump obviously obviously obviously apparently there's a story today that was pretty funny that Donald Trump was when when he was helping do this he was helping write the material for SNL apparently he wasn't particularly helpful but the one thing that he did add in terms of notes is when they came to him his with his statements about his vast wealth he went back to him and he doubled all the figures that was his vast that was his vast statement of wealth so a Donald Trump being down from again hey folks when I rip on Trump this does not mean that Hillary is good it means Hillary is the worst Hillary's the worst why can't we have someone who can beat her and who isn't terrible why why God why why Republican voters why okay so time for some things that I hate I wish that we had an alternative candidate we don't Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is just awful so he he was asked this libertarian candidate Gary Johnson who's a nutjob right former governor of New Mexico from a Republican he was asked about smoking weed because he's been very open about the fact that he smokes pot and by the way if you're a 50 year old man and you don't have cancer and you're smoking pot you're a loser by definition by definition okay like it's not the same thing as taking a drink it's making a cultural statement about what a loser you are if you're a 50 year old man you're either living in Marin County and you're a hippie or you're or you're just some guy who's super wealthy and just saying f it to life and you're just smoking pot because or you're super poor and you're an incredible loser there there's no real in between Terry Johnson was on MSNBC and he explained that he has eaten edibles and blowing a little smoke he said he wouldn't do that in office how long has it been since he has since he is since he has had pot since he is since he's done any of us they asked him he says it's been a grand total of seven weeks the seven weeks clean for Gary Johnson make that man presidents of the United States also things I hate going back to the gun thing Van Jones who was the communist on CNN van J's really is a communist Van Jones he he was asked he was talking about the the jihadist who shot up Orlando and Van Jones immediately goes back straight back to the Democrat talking points about how it's all the fault of Christians basically but the thing is very interesting that we're talking about racially profiling in the context of mass shootings the the vast majority of people who are doing the mass shootings in America not Muslims at all so exactly the young white men it turns out that even the people who are ideologically motivated you mentioned ideology you are seven times more likely to be killed by a right-wing extremists a racist or an anti-government nutjob seven times more likely to be killed by that person is that I emerge that ideology important to your consideration yes it is well well story short but I have to say I'm just saying before we eat we before we even just go down the road of should we racially profile Muslims or not we if I came on TV and said let's start racially profiling white men let's start racially profiling young white men who are loners with bull haircuts people would think wow that's a pretty unfortunate a conclusion for you to come to certainly is the better way for us to move forward so I just first of all we probably should if it's a loner who's creepy with a bull haircut and his white and he's 18 years old it walks into a gun shop maybe we should take a second look right I mean maybe we should if he's acting all weird and stuff maybe we should second Muslim Islam is not a race it's a religion so you can't racially profile Muslims you can religiously profile Muslims you can't racially profile Muslims third the statistic he gives that you're seven times more likely to be killed by right-wing extremists this is a widely debunked statistic it's not true it's lumping and a bunch of people who have nothing to do with conservatism into right-wing it's also ignoring you you have to date it after 9/11 so if you include 9/11 then by far it's it's it's radical Muslims killing people that are the grave danger and if we're just gonna talk murder across the board you're most likely to be killed in the United States just generally you're most likely to be killed by a young black man because 50% of all murders in the United States are committed by young black men all of it just to say that if we're trying to prevent terrorist attacks all shootings are not the same all shootings are not the same if we're trying to prevent Columbine style shootings then if a creepy loner white kid and a bowl haircut shows up at a gun shop and turn and tries to buy a rifle and he's acting a little weird and wearing all black maybe we'll thought of think twice and call the FBI sure if you are if you're thinking about how to prevent terrorism and a guy walks into your gun shop and he starts talking into his phone in Arabic and trying to buy a large amounts of AI munition maybe she'd with the gun shop in Florida did and call the FBI and the FBI shouldn't suck at its job if you are trying to prevent gang killings which are the vast majority of or at least the vast plurality of killings in the United States maybe you ought to have stop and frisk in places like New York in other words this isn't all one big problem one of the things I hate the discussion of crime is lumping all crime together as though it's all of one piece it isn't there are many different types of crime and they all have to be dealt with in different ways but the idea that you can just restrict anybody on this so-called terror watch list from buying a gun and this is gonna solve all your problems it's just not true it's just not true it didn't work for the Atlanta jihadist it wouldn't work for the tyranny of even San Bernardino they weren't on the terror watch list so wouldn't work there either so none of this actually none of this actually works in in any real way well tomorrow we will be back and we'll be talking about Hillary Clinton gave a big speech on the economy so it'll be bashing Hillary tomorrow today was was Trump's turned through the ringer because the news is about Trump but tomorrow I'm sure we'll be talking about Hillary's big speech on the economy and Trump is supposed to unleash a diatribe against Hillary Clinton about all of her foibles about her on fitness for office I'm looking forward to that because now I can have more good Trump than bad Trump and the good Trump bad Trump segment that'll be really exciting so come back for that i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
