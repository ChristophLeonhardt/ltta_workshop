so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lithuanian separate is supported</font>

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,690
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of earlier are confronting</font>

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,420
the rapid reaction forces that are

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,300
deployed here this is a scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,609
basically aping what happened in Crimea

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,210
in eastern Ukraine when civilian

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,980
protesters were confronting Ukrainian

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,410
police forces and in some cases army

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:45,690
military units in their bases don't ask

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,030
what just<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened them yeah so the</font>

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,960
protest kind of broke through one of the

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,850
guys who had been caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> up they were</font>

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,920
getting information why are you here

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,500
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you want from us why are</font>

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,870
you protesting and do you see a problem

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">though if an armed force such as the</font>

17
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:04,739
Rapid Reaction Force is dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

18
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,930
unarmed protesters that could possibly

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,420
escalate a<font color="#CCCCCC"> protest or in a real world</font>

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,260
scenario if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing the riots</font>

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,830
will just bring up they will feel more

22
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,650
comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming and getting</font>

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,430
nothing out of it is so the next time a

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,369
bigger group will come if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be</font>

25
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,030
scattered away I say get no consequences

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,500
step by step by some small chunks we're

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,780
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do one day where you know</font>

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,270
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the protest with civilian</font>

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,790
people then we are also<font color="#CCCCCC"> where I have</font>

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,700
contingency plans we have prepared for

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">some some regular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human forces we have</font>

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,780
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepared for some regular war or</font>

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,030
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> mixture of those yeah just in case</font>

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do decide to something in this area</font>

35
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,710
the point of the rapid reaction forces

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,360
so that the Lithuanians can deal with

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,700
any potential separatist movements early

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,260
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in Ukraine</font>

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> separatist movements were allowed to</font>

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,489
spiral out of control and turn into your

41
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,110
armed separatist movements that have led

42
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a war in eastern Ukraine that's</font>

43
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,250
killed over 6,000 people the Lithuanians

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,840
are very desperate to ensure that

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't happen in their country</font>
