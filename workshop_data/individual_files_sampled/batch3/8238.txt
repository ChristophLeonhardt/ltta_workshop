Tucker: HOUSE REPUBLICANS ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO HAMMER OUT A DEAL ON IMMIGRATION AHEAD OF THE FALL ELECTION. THEY FEEL THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR SOME REASON. A CURRENT DRAFT FOR PROPOSAL BEING CONSIDERED BY REPUBLICAN LEADERS IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN PRIOR PROPOSALS BUT IT FALLS SHORT OF WHAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED ON. IT WOULD TO GIVE AMNESTY TO SOME DA CA RECIPIENTS, AND ALSO IT WOULD CREATE MORE MERIT-BASED LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. BUT IT WOULD NOT IN CHAIN MIGRATION CUT OVER MIGRATION LEVELS OR CRITICALLY IMPLEMENT E-VERIFY TO KEEP EMPLOYERS FROM EMPLOYING ILLEGAL ALIENS. WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS PLAN EXACTLY? LOU DOBBS IS OF COURSE THE HOST OF LOU DOBBS TONIGHT ON FOX BUSINESS AND IT MAY BE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN LIFE THAT HAS FOLLOWED THIS SO CAREFULLY OVER A DECADE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? IT'S COMPLEX THAT I KNOW YOU CAN CUT TO THE HEART OF IT. LET'S CUT THROUGH THE COMPLEXITY BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN IT. THERE HAS BEEN NO WRITING OF TAX AMENDMENTS. IT'S A PREPOSTEROUS CLOSED ROOM DEAL, ENTIRELY DRAWN UP BY THE SPEAKER, WHO IS OWNED LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL BY K STREET, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE, THE KOCH BROTHERS AND WALL STREET. SO IT WON'T BE IN FAVOR OF AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS AND AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES, AND INDEED, THAT IS HIS HALLMARK FOR 20 YEARS IN THE HOUSE. HE WORKS FOR K STREET. Tucker: SO WHY THE PUSH TO GET THIS THROUGH WITHOUT A DEBATE? IT SEEMS LIKE THE REPUBLICANS COULD WIN THIS DEBATE IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE POLLING ON IT, AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE BASICALLY ON THE SIDE. Lou: AS YOU HAVE REPORTED, YOU CAN SLICE AND DICE THE DEMOGRAPHICS ANYWAY WANT TO COME AND MORE PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED AND APPALLED BY THAT DILATORY US AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT IS SIMPLY THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FACT. BUT THEY CAN'T EVEN RAISE A VOICE THAT IS EVEN REMOTELY COMPARABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND GLOBAL ELITES WHO ARE DEMANDING CHEAP LABOR. AND THAT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. IT IS YOUR PURPOSE TO BRING MORE IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY AND TO PRESERVE LOWER WAGES. JUST AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WAGES RISING, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS NOW GROWING. IT WAS STAGNANT AND IT DECLINING FOR 20 YEARS UNTIL PRESIDENT TRUMP MOVED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. Tucker: IS A YOU ARE SAYING THE CURRENT REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS WILLING TO IGNORE THE BASIC LEFTS ON THE LAST ELECTION AND THE EXPRESSED WILL OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION IN ORDER TO SERVE THE INTEREST OF A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE TO PAY THE BILLS. B6 ABSOLUTELY. AND RYAN IS A LAME DUCK SPEAKER, HE WILL ONLY BE IN OFFICE UNTIL JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR, HE RESIGNED. BUT THAT'S ALL THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE CAN DO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. HE IS NOW IN FRANCHISE WITH THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE AND ALSO WHAT WOULD BE ASSUREDLY A LOSS OF 50 SEATS IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AS A RESULT OF MOVING INTO THE AMNESTY OF THIS. THE PACE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS FOR ONE MINUTE, NO MATTER HOW POPULAR THE PRESIDENT IS. AND HE IS WILDLY POPULAR. NO MATTER THE FICTIONS THAT ARE SPUN UP BY RYAN AND HIS SO-CALLED LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. Tucker: DO THEY HAVE POLLSTERS WHO ARE TELLING THEM THAT POLITICALLY, THIS IS SMART? Lou: NO. THEY HAVE WELL-PAID STRATEGISTS TELLING THEM THEY SHOULD RUN ON THE TAX CUTS, RATHER THAN THE TRUMP AGENDA, WHICH IS THE TAX CUTS, DEREGULATION, BALANCING INTERNATIONAL TRADE, CREATING JOBS, BRING IT BACK MANUFACTURING, DEALING WITH ALL THE IMPORTANT ISSUES IN FOREIGN POLICY, WHETHER IT IS THE IMMENSE AND AN END SUCCESS O IMMENSE AND AN END SUCCESS F IMMENSE AND AN END SUCCESS T IMMENSE AND AN END SUCCESS E SINGAPORE SUMMIT, WHICH IS JUST ONE OF A LITANY OF ACHIEVEMENTS THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS IN UNPRECEDENTED ACHIEVEMENTS. IT IS ABSOLUTE DISASTER. Tucker: Tucker: R Tucker: Tucker: I Tucker: Tucker: O Tucker: Tucker: S Tucker: Tucker: R Tucker: Tucker: S Tucker: Tucker: I Tucker: Tucker: G
