1
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:05,219
>> WELL, SANDRA, ALL OF THIS

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,822
HINGES ON WHEN EXACTLY THE

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:10,024
SENATE MAJORITY LEADERS -- IF

4
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,126
HE DOES IT TODAY, THAT MEANS

5
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:14,228
THAT THE EARLIEST WE COULD GET

6
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:15,863
A VOTE ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD

7
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:16,797
BE FRIDAY.

8
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:21,468
THE MORE LIKELY SCENARIO IS

9
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:23,337
THAT MCCONNELL WOULD FILE

10
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:25,439
CLOTURE TOMORROW TO PUT THE

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,407
VOTE SATURDAY.

12
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:28,075
THE FATE OF KAVANAUGH CONTINUES

13
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,312
TO HINGE ON THE THREE CRITICAL

14
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:44,591
REPUBLICAN SENATORS, FLAKE,

15
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,527
MURCOWSKI AND COLLINS AND --

16
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:48,162
>> Sandra: WHEN COULD THIS ALL

17
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:51,498
COME BACK TO CAPITOL HILL?

18
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:54,301
>> WE'RE HEARING THAT THIS

19
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,135
F.B.I. INVESTIGATION COULD

20
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,170
RETURN TO CAPITOL HILL AS EARLY

21
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:56,670
AS TODAY.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,539
IT WOULD BE A VERY FAST

23
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:01,608
TIMELINE BUT WE'RE HEARING THAT

24
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:02,543
IT COULD HAPPEN.

25
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:03,777
THESE F.B.I. AGENTS HAVE BEEN

26
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:05,245
WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO TRY

27
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,481
TO MEET THE DEADLINES.

28
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,615
DEMOCRATS ON CAPITOL HILL KEEP

29
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:09,883
CONTINUING TO TRY TO EXPAND THE

30
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:12,820
SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

31
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,357
>> I BELIEVE NOTHING ABOUT THIS

32
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:18,359
INVESTIGATION UNTIL I ACTUALLY

33
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,628
SEE THAT THE F.B.I. IS TALKING

34
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:24,231
TO THOSE 25 WITNESSES ON THE

35
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:24,865
LIST I COMPILED.

36
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:27,134
EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THIS

37
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,168
INVESTIGATION MEANS WE'RE GOING

38
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,603
FROM 4 TO 6 WITNESSES.

39
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:33,707
THAT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

40
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:35,076
>> REPUBLICAN SENATORS SAY THAT

41
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:36,310
NO AMOUNT OF WITNESSES WILL

42
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,445
EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR

43
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,047
DEMOCRATS.

44
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,481
>> IF YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO

45
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,817
CHANGE THE MIND OF A SINGLE

46
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:45,386
DEMOCRAT, LIKE I SAY, PUT DOWN

47
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:46,554
THE BONG, MAN, PUT DOWN THE

48
00:01:46,554 --> 00:00:00,000
BONG.
