an advisor to the Polish president has come under fire for what some are calling anti Israeli comments he was defending a new law that prohibits Polish people from being held responsible for the crimes of the Nazi regime against the Jews and supposed sentiments in Israel comes from the feeling of shame and the passivity of the Jews during the Holocaust the new law also makes it illegal to refer to Nazi death camps situated in the country as polish ones those violating the law could face severe punishment of up to three years in jail and the Polish president's advisor went even further defending the legislation the religion of the Holocaust has become a symbolic shield for that country which is used by Israel to create for itself a special position in many places in the world a shield which is meant to protect Israel against any criticism many Jews engaged in denunciation collaboration during the war I think Israel has still not worked to through more than three million Jewish people lived in Poland before the Second World War most of them were killed during the conflict the ice which broken our camp which was built in Poland during the Nazi occupation witnessed around the deaths of 1 million Jews to discuss this more in some detail I'm joined by Mark Shula mark is among other things a columnist for Newsweek magazine mark hello to you what do you make of the comments by the Polish president's advisor first of all well very problematic to say the least I mean you talk about Jews being too past civic I mean what was that what was the Warsaw Uprising the ghetto uprising of the Jews took part in or organized in 1943 I mean look what came out after this law was a whole wave of anti-semitism in Poland that we haven't seen for many years since 1946 and the law has sort of unleashed the poles to sort of feel free to do it now the problem with the law is not so much the fact that says you can't say polish death camps but the fact that law says you cannot diminish the role of the Nazis which means that if you say that the poles had some part of it you're violating the and by all accounts while the Nazis were the ones who are 90% responsible for the Holocaust and what happened in Poland clearly they were poles who were involved and clearly there were cases where the poles were part of the part of the problem and so it's a real problem and of course it's a question of freedom of speech as well freedom of people to study the Holocaust to talk about the Holocaust and not to mention the fact that thousands and thousands of Israelis go every year to visit many of them high schoolers and the question is when their guides go to Israel go to Poland excuse me they do they have to be afraid to speak the truth and speak of what went on in Poland look I had great uncles who made it through the Holocaust somehow returned to that town in Poland Frisch dock and were killed by the poles when they came back in 1946 so clearly the poles in that and that free of any sort of guilt on the other hand no not the poles are not that ones were responsible clearly the Nazis were the ones who are 90% responsible so you have to look at it from a whole picture do you think you we're going to see some repercussions for Poland both for the law on the comments coming from its officials is there going to be a reaction to this well it's certainly been reaction in Israel there's been talk about stopping all of the visits by Israeli High School is to Poland it brings in a great deal of tourist money clearly clearly look what's happened is the Polish government has moved so far to the right in the last couple in the last two years since the new government has taken hold that this has sort of been like a symbol and I think this will have an effect on Paul's relations with the Western Europe at this point and I mean it's it's part of a series of actions that the Polish government has taken their member of the EU and yet they're testing the EU and its ability to accept a much more nationalistic government in Poland just finally and nationalism yeah the term passivity what what was your reaction to that when you heard and they advisor to the president talking about the Jews passivity look clearly you know some of the images of the Holocaust until 1962 in the trial of Eichmann there was this sort of feeling that the Jews were right passive and not they didn't do anything when the trial of iPhone came out it became clear that Jews weren't passive yes somewhat passive but most of them were met with overwhelming force some fought back they were Jewish partisans and they were Jewish fighters and the idea festivities you know of course it's the opposite of Israel you know here in Israel the hallway we're designers are in Israel is the idea that we're no longer be passive thank you very much for your time this are a mark Shulman columnist for Newsweek magazine
