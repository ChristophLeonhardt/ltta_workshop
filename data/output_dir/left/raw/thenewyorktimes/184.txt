00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,200
“A lot of strange creatures
live in the cold depths

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,680
beneath the Antarctic
ice, but none stranger

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,100
than the giant sea spiders.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,260
Sea spiders are often
tiny, but Antarctic species

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,820
grow to dinner-plate size.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,940
Even stranger are
their internal organs.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,460
Their genitals and
parts of their guts

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,130
are found in their legs.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,760
And because their
heart is too weak

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,910
to pump hemolymph, the
equivalent of blood,

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,340
around the body,
it’s the movement

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,160
of the guts that do
most of the work.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,620
There are many questions
about these creatures,

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,480
but one big one is how they
get oxygen into their bodies.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
Fish have gills, so
do crabs and lobsters.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,510
Water flows over them and
the gills absorb oxygen.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,990
Worms, in the sea and
on land, absorb oxygen

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,550
through their skin.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,820
But the sea spider
has no gills or lungs,

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,610
and its skin is an
exoskeleton, a bit

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,880
thick for absorbing oxygen.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,880
What it does have are
hundreds of pores.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,070
They use this
respiration chamber

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,410
to calculate how
much oxygen

25
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,420
the sea spiders 
were taking in.

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,250
They found that
the countless pores

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,280
in the spiders’ thick
skin acted, in effect,

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
like breathing holes.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,260
The pores offer an easy
way for oxygen molecules

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,390
in the seawater to be
absorbed by the body.

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,370
To collect sea
spiders for research,

32
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,900
scientists had to dive
beneath the Antarctic ice.

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,220
Since the water
was so cold, diving

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,650
requires serious preparation,
but the result is worth it.”

35
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,770
“I was pretty petrified about
the cold and the ice ceiling

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,870
before I started
diving there, but it’s

37
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,450
kind of spoiled me
for anywhere else.”

38
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,910
“Why devote all this
effort to sea spiders?

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,280
Well, they’re kind
of irresistible.

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,890
Everything they do is weird.

41
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,940
And our planet’s
poles, north and south,

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,420
are warming faster than
any other places on Earth.

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,160
Learning how these
creatures live

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,950
in these extreme conditions

45
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,970
may help us understand 
how they will cope

46
00:02:10,970 --> 00:00:00,000
with climate change to come.”
