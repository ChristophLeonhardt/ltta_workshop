the White House has been seriously considering the establishment of a space force as a separate military department for at least a year long before President Trump brought it up at a rally this past spring our next guest makes the case that militaries have long used space science and space-based technology to their advantage while astrophysicists have reaped the rewards of such military investments he chronicles the militarization of space in his latest book entitled accessory to war the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military famed astrophysicists of the American Museum of Natural History and director Hayden Planetarium Neil deGrasse Tyson joins us now thank you very much for being on with us this morning thanks for having me I guess first of all let's let's lay out the premise of your book and is it based on on how scientists and the military play off of each other yes but there are certain branches of science that have well known in their relationship with war physics for example without physics we wouldn't have had the atom bomb without chemists we wouldn't have had mustard gas and napalm and other weapons of the war and and biologists might weaponize anthrax for example in conflict but the astrophysicists just historically we're thinking but we just sit at the mountaintop and wait for photons of light to come to us and it's a it's a pretty humble state of existence for us and that's all true but at the end of the day if you look back over the centuries and even millennia there's been this two-way street between what we do when we study the universe and what the military conquest hegemony empire building has required of us so you go for you go far enough back the navigation around the world all the great seafaring nations required knowledge of where they were in the world and where they were headed and where they came from where the enemy was where the friendlies are and that required navigation that involved Stars and so astronomers back then were fundamental to this exercise so then it would it would seem that the development of a space force would make perfect sense well space force is not you know just because it came out of Trump's mouth doesn't mean it's a crazy idea it's been around for a while just a clever eye it's been around for a while no one today is questioning the value of an air force when during the Second World War that was simply a branch of the army was the Army Air Force so air from the Air Force then separated apart and then no one questions that then or today space is similarly different from air than air is from ground infantry so it's not a crazy idea I don't have a horse in this race all space activities were previously or currently handled by the Air Force there's the US Space Command under the Air Force any space force would take all of that remove it and give it its own umbrella and maybe add a few things if I were to add a couple of things I say what if you're doing that throw in asteroid defense I don't want to die like the dinosaurs did you know the dinosaurs had a space program they would still be alive today I'm pretty sure it seems to me that there are other values that might animate the practice of the astrophysicist that may collide with the values that animate military folk how do you think about those two that's a brilliant access point and I would say about half this book addresses the conflict the the tension that we experience as astrophysicist we're as a community we are overwhelmingly the sort of liberal anti-war yet we are complicit when it comes to this exchange of Technology we we recognize it's more just over bluntly if we make a discovery that the military uses we don't have much control over their adoption of it if they make a discovery that would greatly help us are we gonna say no because it was used in warfare if it really helps advance our understanding the universe generally we don't we do have sort of a militarized environment in space right 2007 the Chinese took out a satellite and satellite weaponry we have a lot of dual use systems in low-earth orbit that can be transformed into weapons pretty quickly so do we face a system here where we're looking at sort of in 1950s 1960s arms race style where we don't have any diplomatic limits on this sort of thing and we have to compete with each other in low-earth orbit and we're facing a runaway conflict environment yeah another great question first of all the militarization of space when we use that phrase typically you're thinking of oh there's a bomb there's a weapon there's a laser but I think you need to be a little more broad when you think of militarization ever since we had access to space we were putting up communication satellites reconnaissance satellites satellites that are in the service base of spy satellites in the service of geopolitical conflict that's been going on from the beginning in fact Sputnik Sputnik translates loosely from the Russian to mean fellow-traveller and it's Sputnik remember night to welcome the will remember but you read about this but I think the 7 October 4th and the the Sputnik we had a radio transmitter it just went beep beep but there it was over our heads you need permission to fly through someone's airspace but not someone's space space alright the space above it so there it was and wait a minute the military folks knew that wasn't just any rocket it was an intercontinental ballistic missile with a hollowed-out shell and they swapped the warhead for the beep beep transmitter and that was a message that's why we've lost out we freaked out that's why so so there's not a new thing going on here it's and by the way no you're not gonna have weapons destroying satellites in space you know why because you do that your satellite becomes hundreds or thousands of pieces of broken hardware moving at 18,000 miles an hour that can take out your own satellite it's the modern equivalent of trying to use mustard gas - because you can't shoot the soldiers and the in the trenches and you can't shoot me so let's do a mustard gas oh the wind changed oh my gosh now it's coming back in our face so so space warfare is not so much weapons but access to information and the second Gulf War was completely enabled by space assets alerting land sea and air invasions to where everybody is where they're headed where they're coming from and where the targets are okay my mind is blocked the book is accessory to war the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military
