the hearings surrounding the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice by the president has turned into arguably the most burgeoning political issue in the United States at this time as the nomination process continues for Brett Kavanaugh were seeing a circus of anger and accusations Brett Kavanaugh mr. chairman mr. chairman we cannot possibly move forward mr. chary warm world we cannot be recognized I move to adjourn the American so here's why the issue is so divisive the US Supreme Court has the final legal say on crucial issues and justices are appointed for life no wonder both sides want to tip the balance in their favor so the gloves come off the accusations are now flying first a woman who is sitting behind Kavanagh was accused of giving secret fascist hand signals it turns out she's the descendant of Holocaust survivors then some misattributed quotes about birth control started flying around the internet Hillary Clinton herself was spreading this false information she referred to birth control pills as abortion inducing drugs the set of a lot of alarm bells for me and it should for you too I want to be sure we're all clear this didn't happen numerous fact checks have ruled this false then Cavanaugh's habit of buying baseball tickets became breaking news investigative reporters scoured his financial disclosures and learned that he and his friends buy tickets to baseball games so as you can see there's still plenty of silliness to go around but then things got serious accusations of attempted rape which is career-ending stuff in the age of me too came up Christine Blasi Ford accuses Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to rape her back in the 1980s when they were both teenagers while at a party now she wants an FBI investigation if the Senators who have come forward and said they want to treat this seriously mean that then they'll they'll have an investigation of these allegations so that we all go into this more informed so 24 women who went to high school with Brett Kavanaugh signed a letter saying that they support the accuser then 65 women signed another letter saying that they defend Brett Cavanaugh's character now those who support the Democrats generally believe the accuser those who support the Republicans think she is lying and have been calling her name's not surprisingly the media is now taking sides this was attempted rape I believe professor Ford judge Cavanaugh has lied multiple times she's not sore when it happened where it happened who else was present she never reported it to anybody this is nothing if they get away with this theirs then you have CNN running the country because this allegation can be made against anyone at any time now the US Department of Justice says that it's not a federal case but it seems like proving guilt or innocence isn't exactly the issue here I think the nomination should be withdrawn the bar here is not whether you have not criminally assaulted someone its credibility trust integrity so who is Brett Kavanaugh now to some he's a well-respected adjudicator who happens to have some Republican ties to others he's a sexual predator now Supreme Court justice nominations often turn into political confrontations but rarely do they expose such a deeply divided America caleb Maupin RT New York you
