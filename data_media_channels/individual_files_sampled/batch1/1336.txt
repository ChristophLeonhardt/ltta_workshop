Mohammed Ahmed has always identified himself as a Sudanese from the Boucherie tribe which comes from the border area but that makes it difficult to get goods and resources to reach the little town of Oh safe where he lives that's because Oh safe in northeastern Sudan is the closest town to the disputed border between Sudan and Egypt in the Triangle known as Hawaii which Egypt continues to hold Bashar in the double nakida some people say that the bouchard's are now part of Egypt but in our hearts we are not Egyptians none of us say we are Egyptians and even Egyptians don't accept us as part of them Muhammad says he has to obtain permits from Egyptian authorities to cross into Hawaii as the many people who live in or safe but have families in the Triangle the dispute over Hawaii a region rich in oil and minerals started when Sudan gained independence in 1956 and borders were drawn up over the past few years the dispute has escalated with Sudan accusing Egypt of harassing its citizens when they cross into the region and executing dozens of them in the past 12 months alone that fence marks the beginning of the disputed area of the Hawaii I angle Egypt has stationed forces there for more than two decades despite protests from the Sudanese government recently halep has been at the forefront of increased tensions between the two countries tensions exacerbated by Sudan's support for a few peace plans to build a hydroelectric dam which will reduce the amount of water reaching Egypt Sudan has repeatedly complained to the UN Security Council over Hawaii and once a dispute solved through arbitration Egypt has failed to respond in protest Sudan recalled its ambassador to Egypt earlier this month they're treating our people there in humanely there's killings and torture that's why we met here at the Parliament and are taking steps so that it's no longer a regional issue but also an international one Sudan has deployed troops on the border it says it doesn't want a war with its neighbors which must a deal evident in a plan which we will not engage in a war with our brothers or anyone else any pounds spent on disputes or conflict should be directed to our people for those living in no safe it's not the military escalation they're worried about but the relatives they have living in the triangle who have lost their land to Egypt and may lose their identity to Heba Morgan al Jazeera from the Sudan Egyptian border
