1
00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:01,742
PLACE.

2
00:00:01,742 --> 00:00:03,211
SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT HERE,

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,446
TOO IN SEOUL WITH SO MUCH

4
00:00:05,446 --> 00:00:06,314
INVESTED IS HOPING SOMETHING

5
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:08,216
CAN BE BROUGHT TOGETHER AS WELL.

6
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,650
>> IS THERE ANYTHING MORE THAT

7
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,321
WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THAT

8
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,691
NUCLEAR TEST SITE THAT WAS SAID

9
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,126
TO BE DISMANTLED YESTERDAY?

10
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:20,728
ANY VERIFICATION OF WHAT TOOK

11
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:21,462
PLACE?

12
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:21,963
>> EXACTLY.

13
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:23,064
THAT MAJOR EVENT ON THURSDAY

14
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,233
WAS PRETTY MUCH LEFT IN THE

15
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,035
DUST BY THE OTHER NEWS EVENT ON

16
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:28,402
THURSDAY.

17
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,704
WE'RE GETTING NEW IMAGERY FROM

18
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:31,339
OUR SISTER NETWORK IN THE U.K.

19
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,006
SKY NEWS.

20
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,342
THEY WERE ONE OF THE FEW

21
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:35,276
FOREIGN MEDIA THAT WERE ALLOWED

22
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:39,914
TO GO ALONG AND WE SEE THE

23
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,816
MASSIVE PORTALS AND TUNNELS IN

24
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,784
THAT NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE

25
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:44,118
COUNTRY.

26
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:45,820
THAT SITE BEING BLOWN UP.

27
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,354
STRONG EXPLOSIONS.

28
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:47,688
THE HITCH AS WE HAVE BEEN

29
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:50,024
SAYING AND SKY NEWS WAS SAYING,

30
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:51,425
THERE WERE NO INTERNATIONAL

31
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,761
OBSERVERS OR ANALYSTS OR

32
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:54,462
EXPERTS AROUND.

33
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:55,463
REPORTERS EXAMINED THE

34
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,064
AFTERMATH BUT THEY COULDN'T

35
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,466
TELL EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

36
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:00,568
NO WAY TO CONFIRM THE CLAIMS OF

37
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:01,035
NORTH KOREA.

38
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,137
BY THE WAY, BILL, MAYBE THE

39
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:03,838
BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT FOR

40
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,606
THOSE REPORTERS FOR US IF WE

41
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:08,709
HAD GONE ALONG IS A 12-HOUR

42
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:09,176
TRAIN RIDE.

43
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:10,578
ANOTHER TWO HOURS BY BUS.

44
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:12,213
THE WHOLE TRAVEL THERE AND BACK

45
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:16,183
FROM A COASTAL CITY WITH THE

46
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:17,718
BLINDS DOWN, NO FILMING.

47
00:01:17,718 --> 00:01:19,387
NO VIEWS OF THIS HERMIT KINGDOM

48
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:21,822
THAT WE MOSTLY GET TO SEE

49
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:22,390
INSIDE OF PYONGYANG.

50
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,224
REMEMBER, THE TIMING OF ALL

51
00:01:23,224 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS A COUPLE HOURS AFTER THAT
