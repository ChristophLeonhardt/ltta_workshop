1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,100
THE NFL HAS GONE THROUGH
MANY PUBLIC PERCEPTION CHANGES

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,810
MAINLY BECAUSE OF HAVING TO DEAL
WITH THE REAL ISSUE.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,810
I AM SORRY

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,500
FOR SAYING SPORTS ARE NOT A REAL
ISSUE.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,500
THEY HAVE BEEN

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,560
ADDRESSING/NOT ADDRESSING
NATIONAL ANTHEM PROTESTS,

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,430
SPECIFICALLY WITH COLIN
KAEPERNICK.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,140
I THINK WE HAVE AN

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,140
IMAGE.

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,170
I'D LOVE TO SEE ONE OF THESE
NFL OWNERS WHEN SOMEONE

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,090
DISRESPECTS OUR FLAG SAY GET
THAT SON OF A BITCH OFF THE

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:34,620
FIELD RIGHT NOW, IT OUT, HE IS
FIRED.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,489
HE IS FIRED.

14
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:38,489
TRUMP HAS

15
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,421
HIS OWN WAY OF HOW HE THINKS
THAT PEOPLE THAT PROCESS SHOULD

16
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,200
BE DEALT WITH.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,739
IN PARTICULAR,
COLIN KAEPERNICK IS VERY FAMOUS

18
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,690
FOR KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM AS A PROTEST AGAINST

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,950
BRUTALITY, WHICH SEEMS FAIR, BUT
IT'S REALLY GOTTEN UNDER A LOT

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,520
OF PEOPLE'S THIN SKIN, INCLUDING
OUR PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS THIS,

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,460
THERE WAS A LARGE MEETING OF
ABOUT 30 PEOPLE, NFL OWNERS AND

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,860
PLAYERS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
SHOULD HAPPEN, THIS CAME ABOUT A

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,750
MONTH AFTER TRUMP STARTED ON THE
NFL THEY HAD TO ADDRESS IT

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,450
BECAUSE HE WAS RILING PEOPLE UP,
GETTING PEOPLE ANGRY AND THEY

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,640
HAD TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,140
THIS WAS RECORDED AS A

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,770
THREE-HOUR RECORDING AND THE NEW
YORK TIMES HAS A, HOWEVER IT WAS

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,380
NOT RELEASED TO US.

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,560
INSTEAD,
THERE ARE HIGHLIGHTS FROM IT.

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,030
IN PARTICULAR, SOME OF THE
OWNERS WERE A KIND OF A LOSS AS

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,580
TO WHAT TO DO AND SOME OF THE
OWNERS ACTUALLY WHO HAVE

32
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,580
PUBLICLY SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP
PRIVATELY DID NOT DO THAT.

33
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,720
MAYBE YOU CAN JUDGE FOR
YOURSELF.

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,930
ROBERT K. KRAFT THE

35
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:59,110
PATRIOTS OWNER WHO IS PUBLICLY
VERY FRIENDLY WITH TRUMP SAID:

36
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:08,919
JEFFREY LURIE, THE EAGLES OWNER
SAID:

37
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:21,890
THE BUFFALO BILLS OWNER TERRY
PEGULA SAID:

38
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:39,190
AND BOB MCNAIR, THE
HOUSTON TEXANS OWNER SAID:

39
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,430
EMPHASIS ADDED BY ME.

40
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,580
WELL, THIS IS ABOUT MONEY,
AND ASSAULT ON THEIR BUSINESS

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,620
RIGHT, THAT YOU WEAPON NICEST
ANTHEM THING TO THE POINT WHERE

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,890
IT IS AFFECTING THEIR BOTTOM
LINE SO THE NFL OWNERS ARE

43
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,610
CONCERNED ON THE ONE HAND ABOUT
THAT BUT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT

44
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,034
THE DIVISIVENESS IN THE COUNTRY
AND ALL THESE THINGS, I WOULD

45
00:02:57,034 --> 00:03:00,350
GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR BRINGING UP
ISSUES THAT ARE LEGITIMATE, BUT

46
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,880
I THINK THEY ARE MOTIVATED I
BEING IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF A

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,980
COMMERCIAL CONCERN.

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,692
THAT IS TO
SAY PEOPLE NOT GOING TO THE

49
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:10,760
GAMES OR PROTESTING THE GAMES
BECAUSE OF THE TREATMENT OF AN

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
ANTHEM.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,569
THEY CLEARLY HAVE
CONSPIRED AGAINST POOR COLIN

52
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,569
KAEPERNICK.

53
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,210
THIS IS AN
ASTOUNDING ATHLETE WHO DESERVES

54
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,790
TO BE ON ONE OF THESE TEAMS IN
SOME CAPACITY OF NOT A STARTING

55
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,280
QUARTERBACK, BACKUP ONE BUT MORE
TO THE POINT, THIS IS A SORT OF

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,411
ONE-DIMENSIONAL PATRIOTISM
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANTHEM, HOW

57
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,350
LOUD USING A, DO YOU HAVE YOUR
HAND OVER YOUR HEART, DO YOU

58
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,121
KNOW ALL THE WORDS, DO YOU HAVE
TO STAND AT ATTENTION.

59
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:38,151
IT IS ALL

60
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,670
PAPER PATRIOTISM.

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,270
HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH BEING AN ACTUAL

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,720
AMERICAN PATRIOT.

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,060
THE THINGS
THAT ARE CELEBRATED ABOUT THIS

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,210
COUNTRY, THAT REALLY MAKE YOU A
PATRIOT, FREE SPEECH AND CIVIL

65
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:57,970
RIGHTS, IT IS NOT HOW LOUD YOU
SEEING THIS GED AND THUMB SO I

66
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,209
JUST AND THIS IS THE STUFF THAT
TRUMP IS GREAT AT, THE PAPER

67
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,000
PATRIOTISM, THE FLAG THAT IS THE
BIGGEST, THE PENS THAT ALL OF

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,290
THE AMERICAN FLAG ON THEM THAT
HE HANDS OUT TO EVERYONE.

69
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,290
THAT

70
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,319
IS CRAP AND HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING A PATRIOT.

71
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,319
BUT THEY

72
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,709
HAVE WRAPPED THIS ISSUE OF
PATRIOTISM WITH RESPECT FOR THE

73
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,200
LITERARY AND ALL THE REST
ON THIS ANTHEM.

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,470
I THINK THE ANTHEM GETS PAID
PLAYED TOO MUCH AND

75
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,940
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
PLAYED AT THE BEGINNING OF

76
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,419
THE SPORTING EVENTS.

77
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,000
I THINK THAT IT IS
INTERESTING TO BRING UP WHAT

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,350
PATRIOTISM MEANS TO PEOPLE
BECAUSE FOR ME, PATRIOTISM ISN'T

79
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,620
IDOLIZING OR WORSHIPING A FLAG
OR ANY INANIMATE OBJECT.

80
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
FOR

81
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,410
ME, PATRIOTISM IS LOOKING OUT
FOR YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS.

82
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,450
LOOKING AT THE COUNTRY AS A
COLLECTIVE AFTER TO TAKE CARE OF

83
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,190
ONE ANOTHER AS OPPOSED TO THIS
INDIVIDUALISTIC SOCIETY THAT WE

84
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,030
ARE NOW KIND OF LIVING AND
TAUGHT EVERYMAN OUT FOR HIMSELF,

85
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,830
ALWAYS LOOK DOWN AT THE LITTLE
GUY, IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT WE

86
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,521
HAVE KIND OF LOST SIGHT ABOUT
WHAT IT MEANS TO REALLY BE AN

87
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:09,440
AMERICAN DOCTOR IT IS BECOME
KIND OF THIS UNILATERAL VIEW OF

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,710
THIS EXACT VERSION OF MODERN
UNITED STATES CONSERVATISM BUT

89
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,190
THERE IS A SAYING THAT DISSENT
IS PATRIOTIC AND I BELIEVE THAT

90
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,190
IS TRUE.

91
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,290
WHEN I STARTED MY
CAREER I WAS A REGULAR

92
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,790
JOURNALIST.

93
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,910
WE NEED THE FOURTH
ESTATE, WE NEED SOMEONE TO

94
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,910
QUESTION.

95
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,230
WE NEED SOMEONE TO
MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN IS

96
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,500
BEING LOOKED AFTER IN THE RIGHT
WAY, THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TYRANT

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,620
OR A NARCISSIST RUNNING THINGS
POORLY.

98
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,470
IF THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

99
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,470
ABSOLUTELY.

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,190
I GENUINELY
THINK THAT REAL PATRIOTISM IS

101
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,680
PUTTING YOURSELF IN AN
EMPATHETIC PLACE WHERE YOU WANT

102
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,260
TO HELP YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS,
WHERE YOU WANT TO CREATE

103
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,150
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM, THE SAME
TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU

104
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,010
WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
GROWING UP.

105
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,540
THE AMERICAN DREAM

106
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,540
IN MY OPINION NO LONGER EXISTS
AND IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

107
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,460
SHIFTED AWAY FROM A COLLECTIVIST
SOCIETY INTO THIS

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,010
INDIVIDUALISTIC EVERYMAN OUT FOR
HIMSELF KIND OF SOCIETY.

109
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,010
THE

110
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,010
AMERICAN FLAG IS ONE THING.

111
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,290
IF
YOU LOVE THE AMERICAN FLY, HERE

112
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,290
YOU.

113
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,470
BUT I THINK IT IS WAY MORE
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WAYS

114
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,030
THAT WE CAN UNITE OURSELVES AS
OPPOSED TO GIVE INTO THIS

115
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,620
DIVISION THAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION KEEPS

116
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,620
PUSHING FOR THE.

117
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,620
TRIBALISM IS SO EASY.

118
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
IT IS.

119
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,520
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST
ANCIENT PART OF OUR BRAINS IS TO

120
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,610
JOIN A TRIBE AND BE PART OF IT.

121
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,990
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT

122
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,990
WAY.

123
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,990
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO
GRAPHIC 66.

124
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,990
SO WHAT WE HAVE

125
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,600
HERE IS COLIN KAEPERNICK AND ONE
OF HIS TEAMMATES ERIC REED.

126
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
HE

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,570
IS THE FIRST TEAMMATES NEIL WITH
HIM AND THEN YOU MAY HAVE SEEN

128
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,570
THE VIDEO OF THIS.

129
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,410
THERE ARE
OTHER TEAMMATES AND OTHER PEOPLE

130
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,020
ON THE OPPOSING TEAM SHOWING
THEIR SUPPORT, PUTTING UP THE

131
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
FIST, KNEELING AS WELL.

132
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,870
WHAT IS
INTERESTING IS WHAT CAME FROM

133
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,630
THE PLAYERS IN THIS MEETING.

134
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,570
THEY WERE IN SUPPORT OF COLIN

135
00:06:53,570 --> 00:07:05,000
KAEPERNICK, IN PARTICULAR,
GRAPHIC 64 IF WE COULD GO TO

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,250
THAT.

137
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,370
ERIC REID SPOKE OUT ON
HIS BEHALF.

138
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,580
AFTER THAT, ANOTHER PLAYER
CHRIS LONG SPOKE UP FOR HIM:

139
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:27,290
TO 
THAT THEY WERE MET WITH

140
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,960
REALLY NONCOMMITTAL RESPONSES,

141
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,460
NOTHING MUCH FROM THE OWNERS
THEMSELVES, WHICH DOES SEEM

142
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,510
TO SHOW YOU WHERE PRIORITIES DO
LIE AT THIS POINT.

143
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,980
THE PRIORITIES LIE IN NOT
WANTING TO ROCK THE BOAT

144
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,389
WITH THE FANS.

145
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,389
IT IS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
AS I SAY, THAT IS WHAT IS

146
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:46,419
REALLY MOTIVATING THE REACTION
AND THAT IS WHY COLIN

147
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,350
KAEPERNICK IS NOT ON THE TEAM.

148
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,240
IT IS PRETTY DEVASTATING AND
I DO GIVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,330
BECAUSE I DO THINK HE WAS FULLY
AWARE OF WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS

150
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,139
WOULD BE AND HE STILL DID WHAT
HE BELIEVED WAS RIGHT AND KEEP

151
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,639
IN MIND, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
HE JUST DID WITHOUT CONSULTING

152
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,639
ANYONE.

153
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,979
HE MADE SURE THAT HE
WOULD CARRY OUT THIS PROTEST IN

154
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:11,009
THE MOST RESPECTFUL WAY POSSIBLE
AND IT STILL DID NOT MATTER.

155
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,160
GOING BACK TO MY POINT ABOUT THE
VISION, YOU HAVE THIS DIVISION

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,610
WITHIN THE NFL.

157
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,419
EVERYTHING
TRUMP TOUCHES EXPERIENCES

158
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:22,410
DIVISION, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE
THAT WAY.

159
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,410
I KNOW THIS IS

160
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,979
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE I GUESS TAKE
IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BUT I

161
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,850
WOULD ARGUE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WHEN

162
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,169
THEY GO TO SPORTING EVENTS.

163
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,960
I
WENT TO A DODGERS GAME WITH MY

164
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,399
HUSBAND RECENTLY AND WE WENT
EARLY ENOUGH TO HEAR THE

165
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,839
NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND THERE WERE
PEOPLE JUST WALKING AROUND, AT

166
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,129
THE CONCESSION STANDS, IN THE
BATHROOM.

167
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,389
YOU HEAR TOILETS

168
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,759
FLUSHING, AND IT IS JUST
INCREDIBLE THAT YOU HAVE THIS

169
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,929
ONE PERSON WHO IS CARRYING OUT
