so there's different ways of creating stealth aircraft so the very first one that DARPA funded that have blue prototype which was built by Lockheed skunkworks division it basically used faceted panels basically they said let's not worry about aeronautics design I mean usually you build a plane that will fly and yes this plane had to fly but they said suppose we built a plane where the main consideration was creating a shape that was as undetectable to radar as you could make it and yet still have it fly and so what they found at the time were faceted panels that basically deflected the radar energy away and that's why I originally have wheels called the hopeless diamond because it didn't look anything like an airplane that could actually fly it was very very bizarre looking at its initial incarnation this eventually became the f-117 and then led to a series of aircraft including the modern Joint Strike Fighter which is a stealth aircraft now stealth technology has gone off in different directions there was of course also two stealth helicopters that were used in the raid on Abbottabad that ended in the killing of Osama bin Laden sort of a series of stealth aircraft that you see today can all be traced back to the DARPA program you
