one of the major reasons that the Las Vegas terrorist attack was as deadly as it was was because of the use of so-called bump stocks that allow you through modification and purchasing something to take a semi-automatic firearm and closely mimic the firing rate of a fully automatic weapon and now after their use in Las Vegas some politicians are looking to ban those devices and you would think since the only purpose of these accessories is to effectively allow you to circumvent a federal law that wouldn't be that difficult we should all be able to agree is one of the worst shootings in history of our country but not everybody's on board guess who's not on board the IRA is not on board so we've got two bills that would seek to ban these we've got senator dianne feinstein's bill would make it illegal for companies and individuals to buy bump stocks you also have a representative Carlos Cabela's bipartisan bill would ban them as well but the NRA put out this statement saying we oppose the gun control legislation these bills are intentionally overreaching and would ban commonly owned firearm accessories and so they're always worried about that slippery slope I mean sure you just don't want there to be massacre as you say yeah and these things are not particularly expensive the modifications are not particularly complicated by the way up until very recently and perhaps even today you can watch videos on the internet that I explained how to make these modifications well to be fair the NRA if you run into a herd of armed deer you're really gonna need to fire that rapidly to make sure that they don't get you so the reason this story's interesting yeah the NRA opposes every legislation that would regulate guns in any way shape or form because that's they make money from selling weapons and if those weapons kill you they still made the money in fact they'll make more money because you'll get scared to buy more guns so but why it's interesting is because the NRA had said that they were going to be in favor of getting rid of bump stocks and it was like the first time they'd agreed to anything even though like this is such a lab it's so obvious is so easy overwhelming percentage of Americans agree yeah yada yada yada and we're like but when an RA said they would agree I was like whoa okay that's interesting apparently we have hit some portion of the bottom of the barrel and then the NRA was like I just kidding just kidding no no no of course we oppose legislation Massacre anyone you like no at least some more gun sales oh I mean my excuse is I think that it's a better approach to do a regulatory thing it really wait a minute I thought you guys were against over-regulation and you were against executive orders and all that but all of a sudden no not a bill let's just do regulation and it's a tweak it's a tweak what do you have bump stocks are doing you have bump stocks what's the tweak part well and the sick thing is and I'm sure that they acknowledge this is that if you loosen up a gun law people buy more guns if you tighten up the gun laws they buy more guns right before it if there's a big massacre as you say people go buy guns if they complain about intentional overreaching by the federal government people will go buy more guns really as long as they're talking people are walking to the gun stores to buy more guns and so why would they ever concede anything they can simply pretend that the most reasonable in the world is a complete crackdown on guns and that will scare people into buying their 45th assault rifle as Jenks says they're innocent there the NRA a trade group they're there to represent the gun business and so they want to and go on record with things that are good for the gun business they're not there to craft legislative policy for the American public that's not what the NRA is therefore they'll try to make arguments and you see them doing all of these logical gymnastics but they're there to protect the sale of guns now kind of to the point these guys are making it so right on I mean these are assault weapons that are used just to kill people or I guess target practice or not listen I'm not a gun guy per se but I do know that we allow these modifications and there's no reason you need that modification there's just none there's there's no reason that you need those bump stocks so it seems as Jencks as sort of a legislative layup you know you're not really giving up much ground and the other thing I would say is that this Vegas shooter had a boatload of missions I mean how do you let any American by that much firepower why do you need that much I mean I get you want to defend your domicile whatever the deal is but why do you need 30 ar-15s why do you need six tak whatever they are it just it that's the other huge thing that I think we we let go in this country why can't there be some kind of reasonable limit on the amount of firepower that one person is allowed to acquire so - comical things here the NRA said well look it's better to do this to regulation because it's avoids an all-out legislative fight but if you just said it's okay there would be no legislative fight it to Mark's point you bought all those congressmen it was a nice purchase on your part for your business and look I've said it on the show a thousand times I believe in capitalism and of course a mixed economy of some sort government should do certain things and business should and so Nike should be able to sell sneakers all they like because sneakers don't kill people but if you sell something that either takes away our freedom or kills us it is reasonable to say hey wait let's think about how how we do this now not to say that you can't do it so for example prisons take away your Liberty if we incentivize people through profit-making to build prisons well they're gonna want to stock those prisons with Americans right so they can maximize their profit that seems like a bad idea right that's not stickers or jeans or McDonald's and and for weapons they kill people now they also defend your home and you can go hunting with them so can we have a reasonable regulation on hey this will help you to defend your home but you don't really need or help you hunt but you don't need bomb stock for hunting Vermont as MIT Romney said when he was running for president right so so this is something that requires a little bit more thinking and regulation on this stop yeah and only people who would do the all-out legislature fight is the NRA and then Paul Ryan turns around and says well the smartest quickest fix would be just to do it through regulation there their argument for regulation here is astounding and hilarious I thought you guys hated regulation the reason is because the the so-called regulation is weaksauce it's much weaker and it's how much weaker can you get it's just a bump stock you just take it out right but they don't want to take it out there want to keep selling it so they're gonna do the regulation that doesn't actually stop selling it and Paul Ryan what do you mean it's the smartest quickest fix you're the Speaker of the House all you can do is introduce the legislation hey we're having a boat hey we voted yes we're done with it how could how could it be any quicker than that hey no it just admitted you you get money from the NRA NRA gets money from gun manufacturers you profit off of people dying just fess up to it and say hey I'm bought I massacres make me get me more political contributions and that's why I won't do it just be honest with it if you liked this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
