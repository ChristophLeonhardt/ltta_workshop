so David it is hard on this day that with everything that we've seen over the past 18 19 months to not look at Donald Trump as doing either subconsciously or maybe he's just bumbling around like mr. Magoo but he is doing the very thing that Vladimir Putin would want a Western leader to do more than anything else and that is to undermine NATO he could not be doing Putin's bidding more effectively if he were an active agent of Vladimir Putin and the KGB so for now I'm gonna leave that issue to robert muller the special counsel okay but let me ask you let me ask you this what does Vladimir Putin fear what is Vladimir Putin feared over the past 18 19 years more than anything else so Putin fears and resents a strong american-led alliance in NATO but he feels has gone right up to Russia's border has tried to draw in these newly emerging countries that were part of a Soviet empire countries that had bitterly resented Russia's tutelage and now have moved toward NATO for for security he resents it to some extent he fears it he fears that that same desire for something different will and affect his own population it is a dream come true for Vladimir Putin to have an American president arrive on the ground in Brussels and the first thing go to a breakfast and harangue the NATO secretary-general and talk about Germany our most important ally in Europe as a captive of Russia I mean it's just insulting language it's it's it seeks to humiliate the people that he's these dealer with I can only think that Putin sits back in Moscow well I'll tell you what people said to me Russia last summer when I was there they said we watch the american-led liberal international order collapsing and we think that's good but we don't really understand what you're doing do to yourselves so we don't understand what why this is being taken apart but we're happy and I think they are happy but you know people will look back historians will look back and wonder how on earth was this instrument of American power and wealth undermine so systematically by a president who really had so little knowledge about foreign policy well Mike historians will look back at this moment and also wonder why more people were not asking aggressively and and not with guarded words but aggressively asking what does Vladimir Putin havilland Donald Trump yeah because there is we were talking about import there is no other explanation that was a performance for them for an American commander-in-chief to actively work to undermine America's most important most strategic most vital alliance that it has on the entire the face of the earth the only country this helps is Vladimir Putin's Russia well history will have a long list of questions that will have to be answered and that's going to be among them and another question that's going to be among them is why was there such silence from members of the United States Senate or the United States Congress about what is occurring right now in Nick burns you're a man of the world a former ambassador to NATO State Department employee tell us your view your your concerns perhaps about what has happening when you look at what has happened withdrawal from TPP by this president virtually ceding the Pacific to the Chinese who are in Central America Latin America Africa the Middle East in intent on becoming a bigger world power than they already are virtually one foot out the door on NATO the collapse of NATO after 70 years perhaps could happen give us your view your concerns about what is happening right now - our position in the world and the relative silence as we just spoke of from members of the United States Senate about this Mike I think it's clear now 18 months into this presidency that the president is abdicating American leadership it's in the following way he's dismantling our alliances and downgrading them that's been the power base of the United States for 75 years he's dismantled the trading system that brought us this unprecedented prosperity and is replacing it with nothing he's just tearing down and I just been third I've just been in Europe four countries in the last couple of weeks the existential battle right now in Europe is between the democratic government small d democratic governments and these right-wing anti-democratic populace that have taken over the governments of Hungary and Poland and are inside the government of Italy and the Europeans are convinced that Trump siding with the authoritarian figures because Trump has been praising them privately and publicly the authoritarian leaders he's gone after Angela Merkel and there she is on the screen big time a vicious Twitter attack designed to bring her down he's been extremely critical to the West European democracies you can't imagine why an American president would act this way I think it's a radical revolution if you add in leaving the Iran deal leaving the Paris climate change deal we had a power base as the most influential country in the world he only sees trade imbalances and doesn't credit our allies with anything else so we're at a critical moment we do need political leaders to speak out about this because I can't believe that members of the Senate and House think this is all a good idea hey David do you have any sense Nick burns just mentioned angle of Merkel and the president going after her constantly continually you have any sense of the root of this clearly anger that he has to it a amiracle it's one of the biggest mysteries Mike Angela Merkel is really the leader of Europe today does he resent her strength does he resent her because she had a close relationship with Barack Obama his predecessor yeah except I've seen him as anything that Obama touched Trump wants to get rid of does this does he I wrote this morning we'll talk about this maybe but Trump has this odd scarred wounded attitude of somebody who went through terrible financial trouble toward people who were successful and prosperous the Germans are the world's great at economic success stories does he does he resent that but he has been going very directly at her with with political attacks saying that the German people are turning against her he's doing a little bit bit of that this week with Teresa may the British prime minister in effect siding with Boris Johnson who just walked out of her cabinet in an American presence don't do this all Trump makes us forget how unusual this sort of thing is but but asks as the resentment of Germany that's the thing that's really undoing NATO because Germany is at the center of NATO and it seems very deliberate because he does it over and over again to call Germany a captive of Russia yeah he's the most inflammatory language I can imagine well David let's read from your latest op-ed for the Washington Post entitled Trump's neediness is at the core of his diplomacy and you write in part this the Trump were watching is a much Meteor person than the youthful tycoon who vaulted to the top of the world the current version of Trump sees himself as she's a chief executive not of a thriving enterprise but of one that has nearly been run into the ground by his predecessors rather than warmly embracing longtime partners in Europe he presents them and their success he picks needless fights and tries to humiliate people that he feels have slighted him this scart quickly Trump is looking for new friends and investors it's almost as if he's ready to fold what he's as a losing hand and draw fresh set of cards one in this case bearing the faces of North Korea's Kim Jong hoon China's ji Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin and that is Wow that just matches exactly everything that we have seen in trumps personality since we first met him actually well you you you - no no him and the world he comes from I I just had been struck recently that this is not the the abelian art of the deal Donald Trump this is this is the guy who went through the nightmare of near bankruptcy this is the art of the comeback Donald Trump he's got the scars he's prickly and as I said in this column it's almost as if he's he doesn't like the hand of cards he's got so he's laying him down he's going to draw these new ones one of them has got a big Vladimir Putin face on it and it's just it's mighty weird to see him put the angle of Merkel card down and reach toward the door of the stack for Putin I don't get that it's pretty incredible stuff jianming to me since a lot of his practice psychiatry without a license David I'll offer you a theory just as if you can react to it what's the role of misogyny here does Merkel remind him of Hillary the does that help explain the Theresa May issue he does not have a particularly healthy relationship it seems with a lot of strong women what do you think you know I I'm gonna be careful about about adventuring toward the couch but but I do think that we see in Donald Trump an affinity for the big guy you know the guy who's like Donald Trump it is something about him and Kim jong-un as they're walking past the furled North Korean and American flags and you think there's there's something similar in the in these two you see that what he's with Xi Jinping I'm sure we'll see it with Vladimir Putin he keeps saying over and over again I respect I respect letter prove me said about Boris and a kind of rough tough unpredictable British politician he's a friend of mine that's a characteristic Donald Trump phrase he's a friend of mine sort of he's one of the guys so I you know Teresa may a little Merkel are not one of the guys they're not in this circle he's regards as as friendly beyond that I I'm not I wouldn't be wouldn't dare to hit yes all right ambassador burns thank you very much for being on the show this morning we'll be very very hopeful to talk to you again as this just plays out coming up when it comes to the president's trade war what's another two hundred billion dollars turns out a lot at least for the American workers bearing the brunt of it we'll talk about the new tariffs the White House is eyeing against China we'll be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
