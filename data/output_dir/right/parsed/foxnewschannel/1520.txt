TEAM FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL FLY
REAL WELL WITH THE FAN BASE
THAT'S ME.
>> A BATTLE FOR MONEY IN A BIG
WAY.
PETER DOOCY IS LIVE ON THE HILL
TO TAKE US THROUGH THAT.
REPUBLICANS HAVE RAISED A LOT
OF LOOT.
HOW ABOUT DEMOCRATS?
>> A BRIGHT SPOT FOR DEMOCRATS
WHEN IT COMES TO SENATE
HOPEFULS.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FEWER
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR SENATE
BUT RAISED MORE MONEY THAN
REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS.
153 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HAVE
RAISED $286 MILLION.
REPUBLICANS HAVE 86 MORE
CANDIDATES AND RAISED $111
MILLION LESS.
THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN
COMMITTEE IS OUT RAISING ITS
REPUBLICAN PART.
DEMOCRATS DON'T SEE MUCH OF AN
ADVANTAGE.
CONGRESSMAN WHO LEADS IT SAYS
THIS, IT IS CLEAR THE DEMOCRATS
WILL BE OUT SPENT IN THE
MID-TERMS BUT REPUBLICAN
GRASSROOTS.
WE WANT TO HOLD THEM FOR AN
UNPOPULAR AGENDA.
THE RNC DOES HAVE AN $89
MILLION ADVANTAGE OVER THE DNC.
