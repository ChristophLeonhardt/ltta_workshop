>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY REALLY CARE
ABOUT POLICY.
THEY HAVE HAD COMPLETE CONTROL
OF CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME.
>> DESPITE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND
A BOOMING STOCK MARKET POVERTY
IS A PROBLEM IN THE U.S.
THE POVERTY RATE INCLUDING THE
COST OF LIVING IN THE U.S. IS
14.7%.
IN CALIFORNIA IT'S 24%.
HOMELESSNESS IS GROWING UP
ACROSS THE COUNTRY UP 1% BETWEEN
2016 AND 2017 NOWHERE IS IT MORE
IN CALIFORNIA.
ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT HAVENS
IS IN DOWNTOWN LAS ANGELES.
A HOMELESS COMMUNITY CALLED SKID
ROW.
PEOPLE LIVE OPENLY ON THE
STREETS IN CAMPS IN TENT CITIES.
IN 2010 MORE THAN HALF MILLION
PEOPLE WERE HOMELESS.
MOST OF THEM WERE IN CALIFORNIA.
FOLLOWED BY NEW YORK, FLORIDA,
AND TEXAS.
IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE HOME
PRICE IS AROUND $600,000.
YOU HAVE TO EARN OVER $100,000
PER YEAR TO RENT AN AVERAGE 2
BEDROOM APARTMENT.
HOMELESSNESS HAS CAUSED A RISE
OF CRIME IN NEIGHBORHOODS.
THEY BELIEVE SOME OF THIS IS DUE
TO PROPOSITION 46 PASSED BY
GOVERNOR BROWN.
CRITICS SAY NOW DRUG ADDICTS
ESCAPE PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMES TO
SUPPORT THEIR HABITS.
ANY THEFT UNDER $950 MAY NOT BE
SUBJECT TO JAIL TIME.
STEVE.
STEVE: ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
WE TALKED ABOUT CRIME.
THERE IS SO MUCH ELSE TO
EXPLORE.
LET'S GET BACK TO THE QUESTION
IF CALIFORNIA UNDER JERRY BROWN
IS A MODEL TO THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY.
IT SHOWS WHAT HAS GONE WRONG.
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA IS BOOMING.
SILICON VALLEY.
FOR THOSE DOING WELL, IT'S
GREAT.
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT
HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN
CHARGE FOR A LONG TIME.
>> THE POVERTY RATE IN THE
COUNTRY IS $25,100 FOR A FAMILY
OF FOUR.
15% 3% OF CALIFORNIANS FALL
UNDER THAT.
IT'S HIGHER IN TEXAS.
IT'S 22% IN MISSISSIPPI.
HOUSING IS EXPENSIVE.
USED CARS AND FRESH PRODUCE IS
LESS EXPENSING AND WE SPEND
NOTHING ON HOME HEATING OIL.
THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO LIVE ON.
THE MAIN REASON IS THE HIGH COST
OF HOUSING AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE
HAD POPULATION GROWTH.
PEOPLE VOTE WITH THEIR FEET.
MOST OF AMERICAN CITIZENS --
EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN CAN PICK
WHICH OF THE 50 STATES TO
LIVE-IN AND THEY CHOSE
CALIFORNIA.
THAT DROVE UP THE HOUSING
PRICES.
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SCIENCE,
TECHNOLOGY, AND COLLEGES THAT SO
MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE.
YOU GET MORE AND MORE CITIZENS
BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.
WE ARE THE BIGGEST STATE AND
PUTS A STRAIN ON THE HOUSING
MARKET.
STEVE: I WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE
THAT'S TRUE.
I LOVE CALIFORNIA.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE
ELSE IN THE WORLD.
THAT STORY OF AN OPEN CALIFORNIA
IS A GREAT STORY.
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE
REALTY.
>> YEAH, THE REALTY IS WORKING
AMERICANS ARE ON THE STREETS
RIGHT NOW.
WE CAN TAKE $22 BILLION AND HELP
OUT HOMELESSNESS.
ESPECIALLY THE 10,000 LIVING
DOWNTOWN.
WE HAVE TO STEP-IN.
THAT'S WHY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
WILL STEP-IN AND BUDGET THINGS
BETTER.
>> HOMELESSNESS IN LAS ANGELES
COUNTY AND CITY ARE DOWN OVER
STEVE: WE HAD A LOT --
>> THEY ALSO SAY --
STEVE: LET'S NOT END THIS
DEBATE.
THERE IS A GENERAL POINT.
I LIVE CLOSE TO SAN FRANCISCO.
IT FEELS SHAMING, THE PICTURES
WE SAW OF THE HOMELESS
ENCAMPMENTS.
>> I HAVE A BUSINESS PARTNER AND
WE SAID OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY WAS
HOMELESSNESS.
HE'S GIVEN MORE MONEY TO
SCHOOLLESS.
THERE ARE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX
CREDITS.
WE HAVE A CHALLENGE, IF YOU ARE
WELL EDUCATED THE SKY IS THE
LIMIT.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE THE
ARGUMENT THAT THE HOMELESSNESS
PROBLEM IS OF THE HOUSING
PROBLEM.
GOVERNOR BROWN HASN'T DONE
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE
TRANSPORTATION COST AND COST OF
LIVING IT'S UNAFFORDABLE.
>> HOUSING IS A LOCAL ISSUE.
I WAS A VETERAN AND SEVERED IN
VIETNAM.
18% REDUCTION OF VIETNAM
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
AN EFFORT IN THE CITY AND
COUNTY.
>> HOMELESSNESS IS A CULTURE IN
CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULARLY.
I MOVED HERE FROM TEXAS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN A PLACE EMBRACE
HOMELESSNESS.
SOME PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T
AFFORD CALIFORNIA.
THEY ARE TRULY EMPROVE
THEY ARE TRULY IMPROVE ISSUED.
IMPROVE ISSUED.
ISHED.
YOU CAN'T THROW MORE MONEY AT
THE PROBLEM.
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
WHY STACK ON MORE REGULATIONS.
>> YES, THAT'S A REALLY GOOD
POINT.
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A
HOUSE HERE.
YOU COMPARE IT TO HOUSTON WHERE
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT ZONING.
>> CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT.
YOU CAN LIVE-IN SAN FRANCISCO
AND COME UP WITH A HOUSING
PROJECT IN L.A.  IF WE COULD
HAVE AN EXCEPTION FOR SPORTS
ARENAS WE COULD STOP
HOMELESSNESS.
>> DON'T YOU THINK THE
GOVERNOR --
STEVE: HE HAS HAD TWO TERMS.
THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM.
DON'T YOU THINK HE SHOULD HAVE
DONE MORE.
>> WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS OVER
THE LAST YEAR.
GOVERNOR DAVIS IS RIGHT WE NEED
TO CHANGE OUR LAWS --
STEVE: THE ENVIRONMENTAL.
>> THE PROBLEM IS SO MANY PEOPLE
WANT TO LIVE-IN CALIFORNIA.
STEVE: IF YOU BUILD A WALL YOU
WON'T DEAL WITH IT THAT WAY.
WOULD YOU BE IN FAVOR OF
REDUCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL
REQUIREMENTS ON BUILDING A HOME
IN CALIFORNIA.
>> IF WE ARE TALKING CARE OF
HOMELESS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MIDDLE-CLASS.
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A HOME
HERE.
>> THE THING IS WE ARE DOING SO
WELL IN CALIFORNIA HOW COME
PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS
THAN EVERY BEFORE.
WE HAVE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO
BACK TO WORK.
WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.
WE NEED TO BUILD MORE MENTAL
HOSPITALS.
WE HAVE TO REGULATE OTHER
THINGS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE COME FIRST.
