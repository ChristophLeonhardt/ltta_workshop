The protests in Ukraine
that began in 2013
not only toppled
the government,
but also yielded countless
eyewitness videos.
Day after day, protesters
and bystanders filmed
the rallies in Kiev against
Ukraine’s president,
Viktor Yanukovych.
They filmed attempts
by security forces
to break apart
the tent city
that was built 
in Independence Square,
and the clashes 
with masked police
that reached a violent 
tipping point months later.
On Feb. 20, four police
and 48 protesters were killed
in one of the bloodiest hours
of European conflict
since the Cold War ended.
Now four years later, 
these videos
are being presented as
critical evidence against
Ukrainian policemen who
stand charged of killing
these protesters.
Working with incomplete 
ballistics evidence
and amid rumors and denials
about what happened,
prosecutors hoped that
a forensic analysis of the videos
would prove their case.
They enlisted the help
of SITU Research,
an architectural firm in Brooklyn
with expertise in video forensics.
SITU analyzed hundreds
of videos assembled
by Ukrainian graduate student
Evelyn Nefertari to recreate
the shootings in
painstaking detail.
First, they built a virtual
replica of Instytutska Street,
where most of the
protesters were shot.
Laser scanners
were used
to accurately reconstruct
the fine detail of buildings,
sidewalks and trees.
And they modeled
barricades and debris seen
in the videos of that day.
Videos show the Berkut,
a Ukrainian paramilitary force,
retreating along the street
from clashes with protesters.
The Berkut are wearing these
distinctive yellow armbands.
They take a position 
behind these barricades.
We'll focus here on the death 
of Ihor Dmytriv, a 30-year-old lawyer
who had joined the protest the day before.
He was with this group
of protesters, protected
by helmets and
homemade shields, who
followed the Berkut.
Moments later, he
was fatally shot.
His shooting was filmed
by three cameras, which
helped SITU determine his
precise position and that
of the cameras.
By analyzing the
sound of the gunshot,
experts approximated the
distance of the weapon
from the cameras, and
using their 3-D model,
analysts froze the
victim’s exact position
when he was shot.
They marked the
entry and exit wounds
described in the
autopsy report
to indicate a
direction of fire
within a few
degrees of accuracy.
Overlaying this cone of
fire with the audio analysis
gave the experts an
approximate location
of the shooter.
Next, they examined
videos filmed
on either side
of the barricade
at the time of the shooting.
One shows the fatal shot and
a white puff of smoke rising
near the barricade.
And this is security
footage recorded
behind the barricade
within a minute
of that gunshot.
It clearly shows Berkut
police aiming and firing
at protesters
where experts say the
fatal shot was fired from.
Investigators repeated
the analysis for two
other victims.
Lawyers hope that
by making order out
of the chaos and
disinformation surrounding
that day,
this innovative analysis will
stand up to cross-examination
in court.
