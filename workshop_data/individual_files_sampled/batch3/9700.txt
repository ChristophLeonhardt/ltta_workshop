FROM CHILDREN AND FACT FROM FICTION. THAT’S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT’S "ANGLE" ." THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN HAMMERING PRESIDENT TRUMP, MAKING SCURRILOUS CHARGES THAT HIS DRACONIAN IMMIGRATION POLICIES ARE SEPARATING FAMILIES AND LOSING TRACK OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THREATENING TO SEPARATE MORE PARENTS AND KIDS AT THE BORDER SCREAMING AND CRYING PLEASE DON’T LET ME BE TAKEN AWAY. CALLS ABOUT 7600 OF THOSE CHILDREN AND THEY COULDN’T FIND 1500 OF THEM. DONALD TRUMP REALLY IS OBSESSED WITH PERHAPS THE MOST SICK PART OF THE ENTIRE POLICY, SEPARATING FAMILIES FROM EACH OTHER. Laura: PREDICTABLY, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ALSO WEIGHED IN WITH A PIECE TITLED TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEPARATE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM PARENTS AND LOSE THEM? WELL, AS YOU WILL SEE, THIS IS NOT REPORTING. IT’S CALLED TRYING TO CREATE A NARRATIVE REGARDLESS OF THE ACTUAL FACTS TO MANIPULATE READERS’ EMOTIONS AND ULTIMATELY FORCE A CHANGE IN POLICY. NEVER ONE TO FORGO A RIDE ON THE BANDWAGON, CNN’S POSS GOLD TWEETED THIS. A PICTURE OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE CAGES WITH THE CAPTION "FIRST PHOTOS OF SEPARATED MIGRANT CHILDREN OF HOLDING FACILITY. THE INFERENCE OF COURSE BEING THAT TRUMP HIMSELF WAS CONFINING HIM AS IMMIGRANT CHILDREN RIPPED FROM THEIR MOTHER’S ARMS INTO WIRE CAGES. THE SAME PICTURE WAS SHARED BY FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS LIKE JOHN FAVREAU AND THE USUAL TRUMP-HATING ACTIVISTS SUCH AS WOMEN MARCH BOARD MEMBER LINDA. BUT THERE’S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS PHOTO. IT’S FROM 2014. WHEN THE SAINTLY BARACK OBAMA AND THE COMPASSIONATE ONES WERE ALL IN CHARGE. AT THE TIME, THE LEFT-WING MEDIA DID NOT CONSIDER DETAINING ILLEGALS WORTH COVERING. BUT NOW THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO ENFORCE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS, HE SUDDENLY JUST A HEARTLESS THUG. GOLD HAD TO RETRACTOR TWEET BUT SHE DIDN’T APOLOGIZE RATING "DELETED PREVIOUS TWEET BECAUSE GAVE IT IMPRESSION OF RECENT PHOTO." THEY ARE FROM 2014. IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION BECAUSE YOU WROTE THAT THEY WERE FIRST PHOTOS OF MIGRANT KIDS IN DETENTION. IT USUALLY DOESN’T LABEL SOMETHING FIRST PHOTOS WHEN THEY ARE FOUR YEARS OLD. WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR "THE NEW YORK TIMES" TO APOLOGIZE FOR ITS OUTRAGEOUS HEADLINE. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE TIMES COULD HAVE ANSWERED THEIR OWN QUESTION BY READING FURTHER DOWN IN THEIR OWN PEACE. DID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEPARATE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM PARENTS AND LOSE THEM? NO, THEY CLEARLY DIDN’T BECAUSE THE TIMES WRITES THAT THOSE CHILDREN HAD ARRIVED ALONE AT THE SOUTHWEST BORDER WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS. I HAVE A QUESTION. HOW CAN YOU SEPARATE ILLEGAL ALIEN CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS WHEN THE PARENTS SENT THEM HERE ALONE? THERE IS A GLARING LOOPHOLE IN THE IMMIGRATION LAW THAT FORBIDS DEPORTING UNACCOMPANIED MINORS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA, NONCONTIGUOUS COUNTRIES. THE ILLEGALS KNOW THIS SO THEY ABUSE THE SYSTEM AND I WOULD ARGUE ENDANGER THEIR CHILDREN IN THE PROCESS. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN UNACCOMPANIED ILLEGAL MINOR BUT REMEMBER HE OR SHE COULD BE 16, 17 OR ONE DAY FROM HIS OR HER 18TH BIRTHDAY, BY THE WAY, CROSSES THE BORDER ILLEGALLY? THE UNITED STATES THEN THROWS THEM INTO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. ACCORDING TO STEVE WEGNER, AND HHS OFFICIAL, THE 10,000 CHILDREN AND TEENS IN CUSTODY COST THE TAXPAYERS OVER $1 BILLION ANNUALLY. OTHERS ARE SENT TO SPONSORS. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE GOVERNMENT FINDS THE KIDS SPONSORS OR FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES WHOM THEY CAN GO LIVE WITH AS THEIR CASE PROCEEDS, OR BETTER PUT, AS IT DRAGS ON FOR YEARS WHILE OF COURSE IF YOU SHOW UP FOR THEIR DEPORTATION OR IMMIGRATION HEARING. SO AT THE START OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LOST IMMIGRANT KIDS, THEY DIDN’T LOSE ANYBODY. WHEN HHS TRIED TO CHECK UP ON THESE KIDS WITH THEIR SPONSORS, AT TIMES, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FAMILIES THEMSELVES CARING FOR THE CHILDREN, 1475 FAILED TO TAKE THE CALLS OR EVEN RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AT ALL. SO THE IMMIGRANT KIDS AREN’T LOST. THEIR SPONSORS JUST HAVEN’T CONNECTED WITH THE HHS, OR MADE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE. BUT THE MEDIA WANT TO MISCONSTRUE THAT AS LOSING A KID, OKAY. LET’S DO THAT FOR A MOMENT. HYPOTHETICALLY LET’S JUST SAY THAT THAT’S CORRECT. OBAMA LOST NEARLY THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF KIDS, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTING A 2016 INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT SHOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO REACH ONLY 84% OF CHILDREN IT HAD PLACED LEAVING 4,159 UNDERCOUNTED 4,159 UNACCOUNTED FOR. CORRECT ME IF I’M WRONG, I DON’T REMEMBER ANY MEDIA LASHING OUT AT OBAMA FOR LOSING KIDS OR SEPARATING THEM FROM THEIR FAMILIES. IN FACT, OBAMA AND HIS HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY TRY TO A FEW TIMES TRIED TO ADOPT A HARD-LINE ON THE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WHEN THERE WAS A HUGE RUSH AT THE BORDER AS YOU WILL RECALL BACK IN 2014. OUR DIRECT MESSAGE TO THE FAMILIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA, DO NOT SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO THE BORDERS. IF THEY DO MAKE IT THEY WILL GET SENT BACK. OUR MESSAGE, TO THOSE WHO ARE COMING HERE ILLEGALLY, TO THOSE WHO ARE CONTEMPLATING COMING HERE ILLEGALLY INTO SOUTH TEXAS, IS WE WILL SEND YOU BACK. Laura: ONE PROBLEM, THEY COULDN’T BE SENT HOME. THEY COULDN’T BE DEPORTED BECAUSE OF THE INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN PLACE. BY THE WAY, WHICH IS WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT, THE LAW HAS TO CHANGE, CONGRESS MUST ACT. NOT ONLY TO END THIS UNACCOMPANIED MINOR LOOPHOLE, BUT THE CATCH AND RELEASE PROGRAM AS WELL AS CHAIN IT. SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA NARRATIVE IS BEING ADVANCED AT THIS TIME. WHY? IT’S BECAUSE TRUMP IS CLOSE TO MAKING GOOD ON HIS PROMISE TO TRANSFORM OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS FOR THE BETTER. EVEN THE LEFT REALIZES THIS ISSUE IS A WINNER FOR REPUBLICANS. TOM FRIEDMAN, WHO IS A FAVORITE OF THE GLOBAL ELITE, OBVIOUSLY "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST-SELLING AUTHOR. EVEN HE THIS MORNING WAS RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE AS A VULNERABILITY FOR DEMOCRATS. I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT ARE TRUE THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH. WE CANNOT TAKE EVERY IMMIGRANT IN A WORLD THAT IS SPLITTING BETWEEN A WORLD OF ORDER AND DISORDER. Laura: WOW. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO GO WOBBLY ON IMMIGRATION OR EMBRACE SOME TYPE OF BLANKET AMNESTY. THERE IS ONE POINT THAT THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SHOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE ON, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE RECENT MEDIA INDIGNATION. WE ALL WANT CHILDREN TO BE TOGETHER, UNIFIED WITH THEIR PARENTS. SO LET’S MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN THE COUNTRY OF THEIR ORIGIN. IT IS IMMORAL TO ALLOW LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN ALONE INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY OR TO FRANKLY MAKE A DANGEROUS TRIP WITH THEIR PARENTS. AND UNTIL THOSE LAWS CHANGE, IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WILL CONTINUE TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR
