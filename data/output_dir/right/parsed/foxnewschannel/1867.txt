>> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE
PROCESS BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS,
OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA --
PAID 1.8 BILLION FOR HOSTAGES.
YOU, NOT ME, YOU, LAST NIGHT,
YOU SAW IT, KIM JONG-UN, DID A
GREAT SERVICE TO HIMSELF, TO HIS
COUNTRY BY DOING THIS.
BUT THOSE HOSTAGES CAME OUT WITH
RESPECT.
WE DIDN'T PAY FOR THEM.
STEVE: GERALDO RIVERA IS JOINING
US RIGHT NOW.
HE OF COURSE THE AUTHOR OF THE
NEW BOOK "THE GERALDO SHOW."
HE JOINS US LIVE FROM CLEVELAND.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT IN ELKHART,
INDIANA, TALKING A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT GETTING THOSE THREE GUYS
SPRUNG?
>> FIRST OF ALL GOOD MORNING TO
EVERYBODY.
STEVE, AINSLEY, PETE, GOOD TO
SEE YOU.
I'M A LITTLE HOARSE.
I'VE BEEN READING AUDIO VERSION
OF MY BOOK LAST FOUR DAYS, IF I
SOUND A LITTLE FROGGY.
FIRST OF ALL LET'S GET TO THE
POINT.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT ALREADY
ATTAINED A TREMENDOUS TRIUMPH.
THE RELEASE OF THE THREE
PRISONERS THE OTHER NIGHT WAS AN
INSPIRING, THE OTHER MORNING, AN
INSPIRING SIGHT.
IT WAS GREAT.
I THINK THIS OPENING TO
NORTH KOREA IS ON A PAR WITH
SADDAT-BEGIN 1978.
STEVE: WOW.
>> CAMP DAVID, ACCORDS THERE.
NIXON OPENING UP CHINA 1972,
1973, OPENING UP NORMALIZED
RELATIONS.
THIS IS POTENTIAL FOR SOMETHING
VAST AND INCREDIBLE, UNTHINKABLE
MONTHS AGO.
GETTING TO THE SPEECH IN INDIANA
LAST NIGHT AND PRESIDENT KIND OF
DIGGING HIS PREDECESSOR,
PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR MAKING THE
$1.6 BILLION, YOU KNOW, IN SOME
WAYS THE SWEETENER FOR THAT DEAL
WAS TO GET OUR FOUR AMERICAN
HOSTAGES OUT OF IRAN, SO THERE
WAS A MONEY COMPONENT TO
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EFFORTS AND
SUCCESS IN LIBERATING THE FOUR
AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN IRAN.
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MONEY WAS
A FACTOR, BUT FOR THE PRESIDENT,
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BRING IT
UP AND KIND OF RUB IT INTO THE
44th PRESIDENT, I THINK THAT
IS KIND OF PETTY STUFF THAT I
SOMETIMES I SHUDDER WHEN I HEAR
MY FRIEND THE PRESIDENT --
STEVE: BUT GERALDO, THE CROWD
WENT WILD.
>> BUT THAT IS, THAT IS IN A
PARTISAN CONTEXT.
I HAVE NO, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.
IT IS RED MEAT FOR THE, YOU KNOW
FOR THE PARTISAN, FOR THE TRUE
BELIEVERS, BUT THIS, WHAT IS
GOING ON WITH NORTH KOREA IS NOT
A REPUBLICAN THING.
IT IS NOT EVEN A TRUMPIAN THING.
IT IS AN AMERICAN THING.
THE UNITED STATES NOW STANDS ON
THE VERGE OF HELPING SUPERVISE
THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
KOREAN PENINSULA.
SOMETHING UNTHOUGHT OF,
UNTHINKABLE UNTIL RECENTLY.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT, WHO WILL
BE, I THINK, SHOO-IN FOR THE
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, SHOULD TAKE
THE HIGH ROAD AND, YOU KNOW,
FORGET ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID WHEN THEY
WERE IN CHARGE.
HE IS IN CHARGE NOW.
HE IS THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL
AMERICANS.
SO LET'S JUST GO FORWARD,
EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE.
THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING.
PETE: IT IS AN AMERICAN THING,
BUT IT IS IN ONE SENSE, GERALDO,
THE TRUMPIAN THING, UNDER THE
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WE
TRADED FIVE OF THE WORST FOR A
TRAITOR IN BOWE BERGDAHL.
THERE WAS UNDERSTANDING YOU HAVE
TO GIVE UP A LOT IN ORDER TO GET
SOMETHING BUT ISN'T PRESIDENT
TRUMP TAKING A STRONGER STANCE
AND AS A RESULT GETTING MORE FOR
LESS?
>> I THINK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED IN KIM'S HEAD.
I WAS UTTERLY SHOCKED, MAJOR,
WHEN I SAW THIS OPENING
HAPPENING, WHEN IT REALLY SEEMED
THAT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST TALK.
WHEN KIM REALLY WALKED INTO
SOUTH KOREA AND THEY'RE
LISTENING TO POP MUSIC AND I
SAID, MY GOD, THIS IS THE GUY
WHO RUNS THE HERMIT KINGDOM.
THIS IS THE BOGEYMAN OF THE
WORLD.
THIS IS THE MAN NUCLEAR
TECHNOLOGY IS THREATENING THE
REGION, JAPAN, SO FORTH BUT THE
WEST COAST OF NIGHT.
SUDDENLY HE IS SAYING TAKE THE
NUKES.
LET'S HAVE NORMAL RELATIONS.
HE IS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT
MOON OF NORTH KOREA.
TALKING ABOUT INTEGRATING THE
ECONOMIES OF THE TWO KOREAS.
THIS IS UTTER ITLY STEW PEN
DOES, THIS IS SENSATIONAL.
THE PRESIDENT'S TACK TEX AND
STRATEGY IS CLEARLY WORKING.
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE
SUCCESS WITH THE SAME GRACE THAT
YOU TAKE A SETBACK, PETE.
AINSLEY: GERALDO, WE'VE BEEN
WATCHING GINA HASPEL BEING
GRILLED IN FRONT OF THE SENATE
FOR THE INTERROGATION PROCESS
WORKING FOR CIA RIGHT AFTER
9/11.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN QUOTED,
THERE WAS VIDEO PLAYED YESTERDAY
ON "THE VIEW" OF HIM SAYING HE
HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THOSE THREE
TERRORISTS BEING WATERBOARDED SO
THAT WE COULD GET INFORMATION
THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO
BIN LADEN.
WHOOPIE GOLD PER WAS COMMENTING
ON IT YESTERDAY.
SHE SAID SHE WANTS OUR PRESIDENT
TO TRY WATERBOARDING OR GET
WATERBOARDED.
LISTEN TO THIS.
>> REMEMBER HOW THE GENTLEMAN IN
THE WHITE HOUSE TALKED ABOUT
TORTURE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I WOULD
LIKE YOU TO TRY IT.
I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY
BEEN TORTURED, WHO ARE SAYING
THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING, YOU
SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM, BECAUSE
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TORTURED AND
NEITHER HAS DICK CHENEY.
AINSLEY: WHAT IS YOUR REACTION.
>> MY REACTION, FIRST OF ALL,
THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE, GINA
HASPEL SHOULD BE CONFIRMED AS
HEAD OF THE CIA SHE WOULD MAKE A
TERRIFIC DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.
SHE WILL BE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA,
NOT THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA.
THIS IS A TOUGH WORLD.
YOU KNOW INTELLIGENCE AND, YOU
KNOW, THE WHOLE CLANDESTINE SIDE
OF OUR CONFLICT WITH OUR ENEMIES
IS SOMETIMES BRUTAL BUSINESS.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH WATERBOARDING
AND THE TORTURE IN RETROSPECT
MAY SEEM REGRETTABLE BUT THERE
IS NO DENYING THAT IT DID LEAD
TO THE COURIER, THAT LED US TO
THE TERROR MASTERMIND WHO
INFLICTED SO MUCH PAIN AND
SUFFERING ON THE UNITED STATES.
WHOOPIE FOR DECADES.
FOR HER EVEN TO SUGGEST THAT THE
PRESIDENT ENDURE THAT, THAT IS
DISRESPECTFUL AND UNNECESSARY.
YES, WE GET IT WAS BRUTAL.
YES WE GET THAT UNITED STATES
NOW HAS A FIRM WHAT SENATOR JOHN
McCAIN HAS WANTED, THAT WE
WON'T TORTURE.
THAT WATERBOARDING IS TORTURE.
WE GET IT, BUT THERE IS NO
DENYING, AND I THINK THAT THIS
GIVES PEOPLE THE CREEPS, BUT
THERE IS NO DENYING WHAT
HAPPENED WITH KHALID SHEIKH
MOHAMMED AND THE OTHERS, THE
OTHER TWO WHO WERE WATERBOARDED
DID HAVE SOME SUCCESS WITHOUT
WHICH WE MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN
BIN LADEN AS SOON AS WE DID.
AS IT WAS, IT TOOK ALMOST 10
YEARS.
STEVE: GERALDO, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
NO LONGER THE BOY SCOUTS.
JUST THE SCOUTS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
STEVE: GERALDO RIVERA, THE
