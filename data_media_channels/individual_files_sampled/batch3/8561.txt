MEET WITH THEM LATER THIS WEEK. SHEP? Shep: THANKS, JOHN. LET'S TURN TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS COME FACE TO FACE WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, BILL RICHARDSON, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. GOOD TO SEE YOU, AMBASSADOR. THANKS, SHEP. Shep: WE'RE NOT WARRING. THAT'S GREAT. ASIDE FROM THAT, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M TROUBLED BY THE CONCESSIONS. ONE, THE MILITARY EXERCISES. THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE THEY ALWAYS WANT YOU TO GO FIRST. THEN THEY STEP ASIDE AND DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WORRIES HE. THE SECURITY GUARANTEE SAYING TO KIM JONG-UN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO KNOCK YOU OFF. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE REGIME CHANGE. I HE SAY, I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS ISSUE A LONG TIME. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MISSILE TESTS, NUCLEAR DETONATIONS, THREATS, ENORMOUS TENSION IN SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN. WE GOT A LOT OF TROOPS THERE. AT LEAST THERE'S A PROCESS OF DIPLOMACY GOING ON. THERE'S A PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION GOING ON. THE FUSION OF SOME TENSION IN THE PENINSULA. I DO THINK KIM JONG-UN GAVE UP NOTHING. WHAT WE NEED TO DO THINK IS FOLLOW-THROUGH WITH MAJOR STEPS, IMMEDIATE MOMENTUM, GET POMPEO TO MEET WITH HIM, SET UP WORKING GROUPS ON DENUCLEARIZATION, ON MISSILE TESTS, HUMAN RIGHTS. I WISH WE RAISED HUMAN RIGHTS MORE STRONGLY. WE JUST KIND OF MENTIONED IT. I AM PLEASED, SHEP. I'VE BEEN A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE OF GETTING THE REMAINS OF OUR SOLDIERS BACK. I BROUGHT SEVEN BACK IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. THERE'S 5,000. A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT WANT THOSE REMAINS BACK. I THINK THAT'S A POSSIBLE AREA OF COOPERATION THAT THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED AND MAYBE KIM JONG-UN IS GOING TO RESTART WITH THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, VERY SHORT ON SPECIFICS. ON SUBSTANCE AND FOLLOW-THROUGH, TIMELINES AND VERIFICATION. Shep: FROM THE PEOPLE WE TALKED TO OR IN THE KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA, SUE MI TERRY, GORDON CHANG, PEOPLE LIKE THIS, WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING NOW FOR YEARS IS THAT HIS REGIME IS SHAKY BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD. BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE'S FAMILIES ARE LOCKED UP IN GULAGS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AT SOME POINTS HIS REGIME WILL GET REALLY SHAKY. THE LAST THING HE NEEDS IS A PICK ME UP WITH A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. HE JUST GOT IT. HOW BIG OF A HELP IS THAT? OR IS ALL OF THAT TALK JUST TALK? IT DOES HELP. THERE'S NO ELECTIONS THERE. SOLIDIFIES HIM. PUTS HIM ON PAR WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH HIS OWN PEOPLE. THE DEAL WITH THE GULAGS, TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS PEOPLE, HE WANTS HELP WITH INFRASTRUCTURE, HIS ENERGY GRIDS. IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST NATIONS ON EARTH. NO PRIVATE SECTOR. FARMING IN THE 1930s, THEIR EQUIPMENT. WHERE YOU SAY TO HIM, LOOK, IF YOU WANT AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND GULAGS. THAT IS A TRADE-OFF THAT WE USE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, SHEP. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IS CONDITIONED ON HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE BY OTHER COUNTRIES. WE SHOULD A SUPPLY THAT TO THEM. Shep: HOW ARE THE CHINESE FEELING ABOUT NOW? THEY'RE PROBABLY HAPPY. Shep: I GUESS THEY ARE. I DON'T THINK THEY WANTED A TIGHTER COMMITMENT IN RELATIONSHIPS. THEY LIKE TO CAUSE TROUBLE AND TURMOIL FOR US. THE WORRY THAT I HAVE IS THE CHINESE WILL LOOSEN SANCTIONS. THEY PUT MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE SMUGGLING. 80% OF ALL COMMERCE FROM NORTH KOREA GOES THROUGH CHINA. SO THEY HAVE LEVERAGE. THEY'RE PROBABLY SMILING BECAUSE MAYBE THE STATUS QUO THAT THEY LIKE, THE TURMOIL, IS RIGHT NOW IN THE SHORT RUN WITHOUT COMMITMENTS FROM THE NORTH KOREANS IS HERE TO STAY. Shep: GOTTA GO. GOOD DAY, BAD DAY? DON'T KNOW YET? WHICH IS IT? I THINK IT'S A GOOD DAY INCHING TOWARDS A BAD DAY UNLESS WE GET SOME COMMITMENTS AND TIMELINES AND VERIFY TIMELINES AND VERIIC TIMELINES AND VERIICAT TIMELINES AND VERIICATIO TIMELINES AND VERIICATION TIMELINES AND VERIICATIO TIMELINES AND VERVECATIO TIMELINES AND VERVERITIO TIMELINES AND VERVERIFIO TIMELINES AND VERVERIFICA TIMELINES AND VERVERIFICATI TIMELINES AND VERVERIFICATION TIMELINES AND VERVERIFICATION. Shep: SOUNDS LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY. POMPEO NEEDS TO MOVE IN QUICK. TAKE THE MOMENTUM FROM THIS POSITIVE ISSUE OF MOVING CLOSER, THE WAY THAT THE COUNTRIES ARE MOVING AT LEAST CLOSER, THE FUSION OF TENSION. SEIZE ON THAT MOMENTUM TO GET SOME COMMITMENTS. OTHERWISE, THIS WILL GO BY THE WAYSIDE. Shep: HE'S A TALENTED MAP. HIS NATION LOVES HIM. I'M NOT SURE. HIS NATION IS AFRAID OF HIM. HIS NATION IS SCARED. I THINK HIS NATION WANTS AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE ALL PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THE DOLDRUMS. MAYBE THEY SEE A SPARK IN AMERICA BEING HELPFUL. WHO KNOWS OR SOUTH KOREA BEING HELPFUL. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT NEED HELP AND THEY NEED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM GET OUT OF POVERTY AND HUNGER AND YOU
