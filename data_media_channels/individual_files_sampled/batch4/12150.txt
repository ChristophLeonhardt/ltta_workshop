with the left so militant about abortion that they are talking about abortion as a sacrament I'm old enough to remember when Bill Clinton said abortion should be safe legal and rare I'm old enough to remember that now it's abortion should be plentiful available and celebrated we should cheer for it because killing a baby in the womb is a sign of womanhood it's a sign that you are truly a woman in charge of your own life if you have not actually killed the baby in her womb that means that you are subjecting yourself to the hierarchical preferences of evil masculinity but if you kill a baby in the womb that shows that you've stood up to the man sure you might kill the baby in the process but at least just stood up to the man this is the perspective of someone left now the pro-life issue is one on which the right can win and should win because this is an issue that is as vital morally as any issue the United States has ever faced up to an including slavery in the murder of a million babies a year in the womb is a serious moral issue and if you don't think it's a serious moral issue it's because you haven't looked at it hard enough ok but folks on the right tend to shy away from this and it's a serious problem so Leonard Leo who's one of the fellows who's helping from select the the next Supreme Court justice he was on Sunday with he's on this week on ABC and he said that rumors of Roe being overturned that's greatly exaggerated why is it always the job of the right to quality to quell rumors about Roe being overturned I don't understand this why shouldn't the right say hell yes we want to overturn Roe because it's a bad decision why shouldn't that be something the right campaigns on that by the way overturning Roe does not mean that abortion becomes illegal across 50 states if you think that that California is suddenly going to ban abortion you're out of your mind California is not gonna ban abortion either as Massachusetts neither is New York neither is New Jersey neither is Illinois right there are too many states in the Union that are going to allow abortion to continue unfettered
