there was a time not too long ago when the term fake news had an actual definition that people seem to agree on that made a lot of sense and that has since been completely destroyed leaving us to wonder what does that term now actually mean day to day to various groups of Americans and we have a survey from night Gallup that gets into that and finds the dueling interpretations of what that term means which we're gonna turn to in just a second but first of all how important is this area of concern for Americans well 73 percent of Americans say the spread of inaccurate information on the Internet is a major problem with news coverage today more than any other potential type of news bias of which there are many I'm not 100% sure that that should actually be the largest one I think that corporate consolidation and control the media might be a bigger one but it's not obviously a big one and people care about it additionally just fifty percent of the American Americans surveyed feel confident people can cut through bias to sort out the facts in the news down from 66 percent to generation ago and that's sort of what they feel generally but apparently less than one out of three feel that they are actually equipped on a day to day basis to sort out inaccurate from accurate news which is a huge concern and so now let's talk about fake news which if you weren't around originally had a very simple easy to understand explanation it was news that was designed to look like real news but was purposefully deceptive and false intending to sort of hide in the cloak of news convince people things that are not true and it became very large a couple of years ago online because the proliferation of websites that had the idea of news but not actually the content well 42% of Republicans consider accurate news stories that cast the politician or political group in a negative light to always be defined as fake news and for comparison 17% of Democrats agree now understand that doesn't mean that they think news that they don't believe is true but turns out to be true can still always fake news it's news that they in their response say is true but if it makes the politician look bad it should always be considered fake news that's 42 percent of Republicans it's that's 42% Republicans saying I don't give a damn about the truth never cared about it don't care about it now in fact not only am i it's not that I'm indifferent to it I will actively call it fake even though I know it's real mm-hmm man that is the power of propaganda and brainwashing so those guys I will now call it fake news even though I know it is true and by the way as we often talk about studies have shown that liberals and conservatives both have a confirmation bias and have several other biases so you see 17% of Democrats there as well and that is shameful we should actually progressives should actually care about the truth and and we shouldn't try to fit the facts around our opinions we should try to fit our opinions around the facts now having said that as usual don't give me that both sides do it stuff when it's 17 to 42 that's a giant giant difference Republicans do it a lot more yeah yeah no thankfully that isn't everybody I mean even for Republicans it's 42 percent so what about the actual definition people knowingly portraying false information as true information well between 40 and 50 percent of both Democrats and Republicans think that should be labeled as fake news so are they not merciful half the country largely still has their head on right but almost half of the other side just doesn't care as you describe it just does not matter to them anymore and like I said yeah just one quick note about the numbers you know it's a 42 percent of Republicans don't care if it's true they're gonna call it fake anyway 17 percent Democrats but you know I realize halfway through as you were explaining it John the Republicans will then turn around go 42s higher number the 17 fake news but it's clearly Joel I know it's true figures it's true but it makes me feel bad ok news you know what fake math fake numbers fake numbers you know what 239 that's a fake number look it up anyway um and then you have this sort of large area because obviously a lot of this is due to Donald Trump not just him other Republicans have sort of tried to do the same thing about everything is fake news that makes him look bad but there's things that sort of are tied in with that so Trump often will talk about fake sources phony sources the idea being that if he doesn't know exactly who it is that leaked something it is by its very definition false which is of course not true and we know that all of the people surrounding him were competing with each other to leaked as much information as possible but a lot of people who don't know that will then hear the president over the course of a year and then think well in the future if I don't know the source for something it's probably fake which is of course not the actual that's not the case real journalists who use multiple sources can't necessarily put those people on the record but if the information is verified with other people then it is still reliable information in most cases but people are going to lose faith in that as well so two things here one there was a great article about where a lot of the leaks from the White House were coming from and so Trump would go around and be super frustrated he's like I don't know where the source is so it's fake news right turns out it was Trump and he wasn't calling the papers he was going around calling all of his buddies that he plays golf with etc and those guys leak like a sieve so he'd be like oh yeah that I called them you know a poop hole they need to go tell the press is anybody where the source is from one of the sources from it's fake it's from you you knucklehead the sources are coming from inside the moron okay and then finally look guys they just feel like you need to clarify this one more time fake news is it's made up that's where the originator from it's a website you go to and the website has completely incorrect information on purpose to try to deceive you it's not trying to be news then there's bias which you can argue exists in a lot of different places including yes definitely in the mainstream media and I would argue that you remember the Washington posted the 16 headlines against Bernie Sanders in 16 hours and it was unbelievable that God a hey Bernie says now in that case they don't know they hate Bernie Sanders no conspiracy they didn't get together in a room be like alright let's bury the guy right let's bury him now thank ya some of might you think is so you might think that they did but that is not really how it works I've been there it's just they truly believed that he had no chance of winning they truly believed that he was a dangerous communist like these insane thoughts and so it but he colored their view of Sanders so much that they became like Trump supporters the press did and you would show them polls of Sanders doing 12 points better than Hillary Clinton against Republicans whether it was Cruz or Trump or generic Republican and they go no I don't believe those numbers I don't believe those numbers Bernie can't win thank you and even after the election when I was talking about 2020 and I talked it was off the record so I'm not gonna say who or what publication but a major publication and and and the well-known reporter like almost screamed Bernie will never be President and that was only a little while after they had said that they don't do opinion mm-hmm so there of course bias exists in the news but the Washington Post The New York Times etc are not going out there writing fake stories with that are not attached to the truth and then finally there's perspective journalism as well and that could but that's at least honest about their perspective I think that's what we do here once the Fox News dropped their BS fair and balanced slogan you know to some degree Hannity's honest about what he does he might lie in his the content but he says I'm a conservative and this is my perspective right so that those are the different kinds of news yeah so not everything you disagree with is great news yeah you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
