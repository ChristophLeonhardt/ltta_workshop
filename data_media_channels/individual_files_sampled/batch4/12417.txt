Democrats are furious that a conservative 5-4 Supreme Court majority is standing up for the Constitution in the rule of law Democrats Democrats hate that stuff all the guns and freedom of speech it's yucky anyway this is bringing home to the Dems the importance of Donald Trump's appointment of Neel Gorsuch to the court rather than Merrick garland who was the Pick of President Pajama Bahama whatever his name was I can't remember now that his legacy is little more than a handful of sand washed forever out to sea by the rising tide of events anyway left-wing bloggers Mathew Iglesias tweeted quote the theft of Merrick garland Supreme Court seat is legitimately the greatest heist in world history and we know this must be true because Iglesias describes himself on his Twitter page as quote a bold truth teller who refuses to be silenced unquote I'm not making that up the man calls himself a bold truth teller who refuses to be silenced I know it's hard to imagine that level of pompous ass humorless self-regard but there it is where was I oh yeah anyway I figured if this bold truth teller who refuses to be silenced says the appointment of course hitch was the greatest heist in world history we ought to make a movie about it we can call it oceans sixty three million in which approximately half the American electorate using strictly legal and constitutional means delay a Supreme Court pick until by strictly legal and constitutional means they elect the president they want to pick the judge they want here's the trailer for the film you're either in a year out right now

funny we know they hate Trump and now we know that they hate you because you voted for Trump in fact the gray B and people put together a montage of the left just hating on you because you voted for Trump this is a cut 7 you play away if you vote for Trump then you the voter you not Donald Trump or standing at the BART border like Nazis going here you here and I think we now have to flip it and it's a given the evilness of Donald Trump if you hold down the woman while the rapist is raping her and you didn't rape her are you a rapist tens of millions of people voted for him after he showed his cards for years where you said we are you suggesting that they're racist or they're yes yeah the people who vote all the people who voted for Donald Trump yes if Republicans weren't so racist they could encourage black people who are morally conservative to be on their side those people who are supporting what he's doing here are traces period movements and people that are speaking up for things whether we're talking about civil rights movement whatever else those movements should be nonviolent but they should not be non-confrontation so these policies that this administration is putting forth are intentionally cruel they are racist and it isn't it is our job as citizens to speak out against that now does that mean that we're gonna be violent no but does that mean that Sarah Sanders can have a nice quiet dinner with her family when she is taking our tax dollars to implement this policy I don't think so now so they hate Trump they hate you now it turns out they hate the law they hate the law itself I mean they hate the law enforcing the law at the borders and they hate the fact the Supreme Court is making decisions by a narrow this narrow majority this Gorsuch majority 5-4 that basically just says the law is the law when they ruled supporting Trump's travel ban you know let me just read you that what the law says okay whenever the this is the law passed by Congress whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States he made by Proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non immigrants were imposed on the entry of aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate so when Trump said we're gonna deem all those Muslims in Venezuela in North Korea but also Chadd Iran Libya Syria Yemen and Somalia and he said it was because of they're vetting process this is the third time they finally got it right but he said they're betting process wasn't any good Chad fixed its vetting process and was taken off the list when they said this they said okay that's the law he has the right to do it it's I don't particularly think this is an important route an important restriction by the way none of these people have attacked us that this is not gonna make us any safer the danger is coming from within the danger of the people the young men who get convinced that this nonsense ideology but but he has the right to do it and he and it's not for the courts to say oh I'm sorry we don't like President Trump and that's essentially what the dissent was we don't like Trump so he doesn't have the right to do it even though the president does there was also a major major this is a huge decision saying that you don't have to well you know what let us bring on Jenna Ellis Jenna Ellis is the director of public policy for the James Dobson Family Institute she's an accomplished constitutional law attorney and has a background in criminal law contracts public policy leadership and ethics she appears on all over the place but happily she appears here and she has her book the legal basis for a moral Constitution a guide for Christians to understand America's current constitutional crisis long time no see Jenna it's like it has been a busy week at the Supreme Court we have to talk let's talk first about this this latest decision about public sector unions can you explain what they decided yes so this is the latest in the compelled speech cases regardless of whether it's over an abortion pregnancy center whether it's about union workers whatever the context this case in Janis was another compelled speech case and where the Supreme Court through Justice Alito and again like you said that very slim 5-4 majority saying the government cannot compel you as an individual to participate in or subsidize speech that you fundamentally disagree with so this particular case was in the context of union workers who were forced to subsidize a union representation that they may disagree with and that way the central issue in Janice but again this was just a long line of cases this week actually and also following the masterpiece cake shop case that really stood for the principle that the First Amendment is valid and that the government is not going to tell you or me what speech we have to participate in and what things we have to advance so basically before this if you've got a job say as a teacher and you join the teachers union and the teachers union was using your money you had to pay them the money you had to be in the Union to work and they used that money to support candidates you didn't like there was nothing you could do about it right but now you don't have to do not have to join is that what it is you don't have to join the Union now you don't have to pay the fees okay yeah so this returned in 1977 precedent that had upheld a similar law basically saying if you were part of this collective bargaining agreement you didn't have a choice and you had to pay the union dues and this is saying that payment that contribution is speech and the government can't compel you to essentially support the collective bargaining agreements and any other form of the Union that will contribute to speech that you fundamentally disagree with ruling but it's a huge deal because these teachers unions most of these public sector unions are big Democrat funders I mean all this money is going right from the pocket of teachers to the Democrat Party isn't that is that not fair to say yeah and this is why a lot of the headlines that you see today is the Supreme Court strikes a blow to to unions or we saw in the National Institute of life and family advocates vanilla case that was just handed down yesterday you know the Supreme Court favors the pro-life movement over abortion rights that's not true what the Supreme Court is doing is simply applying the Constitution faithfully and accurately like an umpire in baseball they're simply just calling balls and strikes fairly they're not actually saying we like unions or we don't like unions what they're saying is that the Constitution does not give the government the ability to compel speech in these particular contexts and that's actually a good thing so it's not them picking and choosing winners and losers it's not about whether or not they like unions whether or not they like pregnancy centers whether they like abortion rights this stands for the proposition the government cannot compel speech now for the long a long time the Supreme Court has been really good about the First Amendment very strong on it but Elena Kagan I think it was today or yesterday when this when this decision gave she accused the level weaponizing the First Amendment I mean as far as I'm concerned they could nuclearized the First Amendment you know they just below below all restrictions on free speech right off but what is what is she talking about what is her point of view there yeah and this is this is in the the Janice dissent and what's so ridiculous is that the the left is making an emotional appeal because weaponizing sounds like a bad thing and so to weaponize the First Amendment it's basically saying oh no the government isn't going to compel you to now participate in all of these things that actually advanced the leftist causes so that's basically weaponizing us to go out and support the speech that we deem appropriate that we the people can actually participate in speech that we want so her term of weaponizing really is saying the First Amendment is going to protect you in the way that the Constitution actually intended she's just using a really negative term that's very disappointing from Kagan because she's a little smart I mean Sotomayor is I I think it's kind of a knucklehead but but Kagan is a smart woman and I it's sad to hear that from her now on the on the case of the abortion the anti abortion clinics these are emergency pregnancy clinics in California that want to encourage you not to have an abortion and California said well you have to tell them that they can get an abortion and the Supreme Court said no you that they don't believe in that they don't have to say it what about the argument that there are laws on the books that compel abortion clinics to tell you that you you don't have to do this is that this is that covered by this law as well by this decision so there's there's a difference here between giving women all medically sound information about a medical intervention and that's what Alliance defending freedom argued in this case is that there's a difference between saying if you want a medical intervention which is an abortion because if a woman is pregnant unless something naturally happens where they missed abortion is always a medical intervention it's an abortion doesn't happen naturally so if you are going to get any elective procedure then doctors always will give you the adequate information so that you can make a sound decision and so what basically the difference is is if you go to a pro-life pregnancy crisis center and you're saying you know I want to be here to talk about all of this then then what the California law was doing was trying to compel those providers to say well one of your options is the medical intervention when that's actually not related at all to their health care decisions so that's that's a fundamentally different circumstance in those equations but this particular case in if Allah talked about how a pro-life pregnancy crisis center does not have to refer for abortion so Andrew this would be the same thing as if you know we were holding an Alcoholics Anonymous group and every single person who came through the door we had to have these big placards we had to have brochures we had to inform them here's where you can get state-funded alcohol what yeah Jenna thank you so much for coming I really appreciate your putting this in the context of the First Amendment I I didn't I didn't quite see that connection and it really is it's good it's excellent news it's too bad it's only a 5-4 margin but hopefully it'll get bigger over time it is and this is why the midterms matter we have to keep a really good Senate that will approve the next hopefully Trump nomination to the Supreme Court and this is encouraging but you're right it's a very slim margin Jen Alice thank you very much director of public policy for the James Dobson Family Institute we'll see you again soon probably thanks you know I didn't even actually think about that that all of these are covered by the First Amendment and if you think that they like the First Amendment let me read you something that was in the New York Times a former newspaper that they ran a they have a philosophy column and it's called the stone or the rock I think because of the people in it have that's what they have in their heads and this was the eCall the ignorant do not have a right to an audience and he talks about Ann Coulter Jordan Peterson and who is the other one the Charles Marie he talks about and he says that if you think these people have a right to an audience he says you can't silence them but you don't have to give them a platform that means that colleges shouldn't have to invite them and he's he says you're listening to John Stuart Mill who wrote the famous book on liberty in which he talked about basically that any given opinion that someone expresses it you know you have the right to express your opinion basically John Stuart Mill's is the founder of what we call classical liberalism which is your freedom ends at the other guys knows you have a right to swing your fists until it reaches the other guy's nose then you got to stop and what he is talking about is the arguments of Herbert Coons or more Cuza who was a truly dangerous thinker who said basically that his moral a penny was a socialist you see a debate basically that moral opinions had the quality of fact and you could not and you could sense her people who disagreed with you and you had to and this is the New York Times is allowing this guy well you know he listened freedom of speech let him have a say but it tells you where these people stand they hate Trump they hate you and they hate the law and you know one of the things we talked about earlier I think it was this week maybe last week was that the the law the rule of law protects your freedom and it protects your equality if we are all governed by the same law we are all equal you and a gazillionaire are equal if you both have to obey the law Bill Cosby has all the popularity and all the money in the world but he can be brought to trial for breaking the law if the law is just what we want it to be if the law is just what the mob at the moment says then you don't have that equality and you don't have freedom because your freedom depends on your representatives making the law if the law that they make whether it's at the border whether it is a constitution if the law that they make is overruled by the sound of crying babies by your emotions then you have a problem if you go to if you say to your representatives hey you know what this is a bad situation change this law then you have deliberations you have debates you have all the things that are putting place to keep your freedom and your representation and your equality alive when you lose that stuff it just all becomes emotion here's how the New York Times a former newspaper here's how they covered Sonia Sotomayor Xand Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent on the travel ban being legal now remember the Supreme Court as Jenna said they did not say the travel ban was a good thing they didn't say it was smart I don't say it's my I don't even think it really matters that much I just think it was kind of to fulfill Trump's promises but basically the argument that's Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg made was that Trump had said so many nasty things about Muslims on the campaign trail that even though this wasn't a Muslim ban we had to regard it as an anti Muslim ban because of the things that he said so in other words Trump could not do what the law that a president could do because they didn't like the things he had said elsewhere that was the argument they were making that is a dumb argument I'm not a lawyer you don't have to be a lawyer to see that is not a constitutional based argument that is an emotion based argument so what does the New York Times do they sell it to you like this is like out of some old movie listen to the way they wrote the story and it takes paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs before they tell you what the dissent is they never really tell you what the dissent is Chief Justice John Roberts jr. reading for the majority spoke clinically Justice Stephen Breyer followed working his way through his dissent mildly and analytically then it was justice I got to give us some drama because that's the way they want to read it then it was Justice Sonia Sotomayor ha's turn steely and unwavering she began the United States of America is a nation built upon the promise of religious liberty our founders honored that core promise by embedding the principle of religious neutrality in the First Amendment the crowded court house fell silent in upholding president Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries Allah right because of only some of them were Muslim justice Sotomayor continued the Supreme Court had failed to safeguard that fundamental principle for the next 20 minutes she remained resolute as she delivered I mean you gotta be kidding me you have got to be kidding me because it's all emotion they want the rule not of law but of emotion and it's just it is driving them crazy that that this Gore surge is making the difference that is keeping the rule of law in place and listen we're winning today we're winning this week it has been a really good week for the people who love the conifer get about Trump you know it's it's not about Trump it's about the Constitution is about the law it is about Trump being able to do what the law says he can do even though he's Trump even though he's Trump he gets two ears the president he's duly elected he gets to do what the president gets to do but you know there was a election there were primaries and elections primaries yesterday and in New York in the 14th district which is part of Queens and Manhattan a a staunch Democrat who had been in who's been in the house for 20 years was thrown out in favor of a 28 year old socialist she is a member of the Democratic socialists of America her name the his name is Joe Crowley and her name is let me see if I've got it but yeah Alexandria occasio Cortes and she's in her 20s and she won okay and so now they've got the socials and this is do not mistake this this is the future of the Democrat Party this is the way they're going if they keep going in the direction they are and she said she was very open she says she supports impeachment and she wants basically open borders let's listen to cut number 12 we have to do it I think what really we need to focus on is making sure that we are advocating for the policies to win in November but ultimately I think that what we need to kind of focus on is is ensuring that we can you know when people break the law potentially break the law that we have to hold everyone accountable and that no person is above that one do you see yourself Alexandra is more of a democrat or progressive would you say I am a member of the Democratic Party this morning I'm absolutely I'm proud to be a Democrat I was raised in a Democratic family with democratic values but it also means that the Democratic Party is a big tent and there are so many ways to be a Democrat and I'm proud to bring to Congress an additional perspective and a lens towards what the future of the Democratic Party may be that's that's amazing you should hear me but should also play this I know we're getting a little tight on time because I want to get to the mailbag but we should play this response about the border she wants to eliminate ice she wants to get rid of ice and listen to what her idea of a secure border is secure to make sure that people are safe and passage but what we need to realize and remember is that ice was established in 2003 right at the same time as the Patriot Act the AUMF the Iraq war and we look back at a lot of that time and legislation as a mistake now and I think that I is right there as a part of it it has extra this extrajudicial nature is baked in to the structure of the agency and that is why they're able to get away with black you know with black sites out our border with a separation of children we are we are committing human rights abuses on this border and separating children from their families and what that you know is is part of the structure of the agency we can replace it and we can replace it with a humane agency that is directed towards safe passage what in the event of the actual criminalization what do you mean black sites what do you mean about black site so I was just yes yes so actually we were just hopping off MSNBC and and they were talking about it basically what we have is that people are not able to access even our own members of Congress are not able to access what is happening in these sites that's right soon the black sites thing is nonsense but what she said is she wants to rearrange it so they we have safe borders for safe passage safe borders for people breaking the law and coming into the country that's what she wants so listen people ask well socialism come to America and the answer is yes why because socialism is death and death comes to everything freedom is a living thing all living things die socialism is the form by which free nations die okay this is the first lump you find and this is why you have to fight every day this is why I support Trump even when I get angry at them even when I don't like him I support him because every day is a day one day America will die but not today and that is the conservative method message we are always fighting we're like the doctors we're always fighting death you ultimately lose because all things die but not today and that's and that's why it matters that's why today matters you don't you know you don't get a lump on your on your body and say oh well I won't check it out cuz eventually I'm gonna die you know you'll fight it every step of the way and we are fighting for our country every step of the way you know we it's it's gonna be my lifetime your lifetime hopefully the next lifetime you never know you never know when death will come not today that is the attitude you've got to have and this woman is the first whiff of this and the Democrat Party doesn't mean it can't be cured doesn't mean we can't get rid of it but you got to fight it every single day we got the mailbag coming up come on over to the Daily wire.com while you're there subscribe then you can be in the mailbag where it's stuffy but all your questions get answered all right the mailbag guy that's what I was gonna say all right from Tori dear host of the best podcast I have ever listened to that is in fact my middle name I left my husband of 30-plus years because he lost his job 10 years ago and never attempted to find a new one he isolated himself from friends and family and would not seek help despite the pleas from everyone who loved him he tells me that he committed to love me through sickness and health and that obviously I made an unchristian choice not to do the same on a good day I believe I didn't have a choice and I know I'm living a better life away from abuse and darkness on other days I need to ask the question about whether this is an acceptable reason to leave I should also say we have three kids and I waited till they were all adults to make this impossible choice thanks for any light you can bring to this darkness Tori Tori i absolve you I let you off the hook you are now free to live your life if you were being abused now you don't tell how you were being abused but if you were being truly abused and you waited till your kids were gone I think you have done everything you can do you were not meant to live a life abused and the three reasons to get divorced our abuse adultery and addiction it sounds like there were a couple of those and play here if that's true if I'm right if I'm reading a little bit between the lines just let yourself go this is not this is not about Jesus Jesus did did say that there was there was there were reasons to get divorced he said sexual malfeasance but remember Jesus was also one of the important things about Jesus was he was a man in his time as well as the son of God he was a man in his time speaking to people in a time and he was speaking at a time when if a woman was divorced she could be divorced basically by a guy saying I divorced thee you know when a woman was divorced she had nothing she was left out in the middle of nowhere and he was protecting her from that however however yours you are a family you are one flesh you don't want to get divorced you know for no reason whatsoever if you were being abused and it sounds like this guy was really in bad shape you were you were free to leave you have let the kids grow up and i absolve you I set you free you are now from you have an official absolution from the Andrew Klavan show that is gold you can take that right Bank from Rick dear Andrew the nature of the universe has been explained from moments after the Big Bang all the way through the evolution of life on Earth in a very consistent and robust way God's place in such an objectively explained universe lies in our gaps of understanding which is always shrinking due to objective science yet the data show that religious people live happier and more productive lives I want to have this happier and more productive life also is it not rational then to simply act as if God exists even though I don't believe in it in my heart because I am a rational actor and God's existence is unprovable and apparently unlikely why is absolute faith required when one can simply refer to the Bible as a set of wise teachings divorce reality but filled with important life lessons ok everything about this letter is untrue first think but no no what I shouldn't say that I shouldn't say first of all you know in moments when your faith wavers to act as if you had faith is not a bad idea David Mamet wrote that in the that wonderful movie when is that movie with Paul Newman Oh absence of malice absent no no the verdict the verdict sorry and ma'am it always writes these wonderful lines and says says they come from somewhere else then they're so good that you think they do so he says in my faith we say actors if you have faith and faith we'll be giving it as mammoth yeah but anyway all right let's get back to the letters the nature of the universe has been explained from moments after the Big Bang when time began all the way through the evolution of life on earth in a very consistent robust way in other words we know that a lot of the mechanics of life which we didn't know before science came God first of all exists out of time and he is not he is not matter he is the meaning of matter so it's it's fine that we know all the mechanics of the way things work we don't know the meaning of the things and we don't know what they represent so just think of it it's the same as language ok I say two plus two equals four everything that happened just now was physical you heard it through the sound waves you heard it in your ears the mechanics of your ear my brain fired too let me say that my voice my breath stirred my vocal cords all of these things took physical form but two plus two equals four has no physical form two plus two equals four is the meaning of what happens right God is like that what what happens in life what happens in history what happens in your heart all of it is explainable but the meaning of it is above that the idea of it is above that and that is where God lives and that is what you have faith in what you have faith in is that you are not just some piece of meat that is flicking from the room to the grave with no meaning whatsoever that this is a moment that is happening in God's mind and you are his idea and that idea goes on as long as God goes on and that is that is why in Christianity they preach the resurrection of the body it's because you or matter God speaks through matter and you will have a body beyond this body another kind of body in the future so none of the science that you're talking about this god of the gaps you're talking about is the god of foolish people okay just because foolish people foolish people have foolish ideas about God they also have foolish ideas about science foolish people's foolish ideas do not disprove the thing that they're talking about the the science that you're all talking about is wonderful it's delightful but it has it speaks nothing into the meaning of things which is what we're talking about when we're talking about God and religion I hope that I have answered the question I think so thanks sorry I got that distracted by trying to remember the name of the movie from Doran in response to my interview with John Miller what books would you recommend from Daniel Silva and Dean Koontz Oh first of all as Silva has a series and I'm one of those guys who likes to take series from the beginning I always read the beginning his first book is probably not as best he gets better as he goes along but just pick up as his guy is named Gabriel along and just Google that series and read it it's so into a mean it is so addictive in fact I like to buy this used bookstore I go to here called the Iliad which I just love and I'd like to go and pick up his books and they sold out of all his books oh I can't get the next book in the series and I could I could order it and pay for it and I probably will but it just I always love to go to the Iliad spikes use Koontz is terrific I mean Koontz is a real and he's a fan of mine by the way he has sent me a fan mail um but Koontz is is great intensity is a wonderful book he has a lot of oh there's one what what is the one I Jesus I'm missing all these titles but but he almost everything he does is good intensity is a really really powerful one the silent corner the whispering room he's just got a lot of really great books and you can just go you can almost go and pick one up at random he is so intense and such a good writer he's kind of he's kind of like a the Stephen King he's a huge bestseller but people always go to king first but croons kind of occupies though a little bit of that space in a much more morally intense and astute way he really is a good thinker as well as a good writer from coal deer hateful lord Clavin hated by some leftist hate groups but not by the hateful Southern Poverty Law Center I know and I'm bitter about it my question is do you find yourself more annoyed by the left now during the Trump administration or before by the flipper Rama Obama administration well I much more during the Obama administration Obama I thought was really doing harm to the country there was no way of knowing that Trump was going to destroy his legacy and blast it into little radioactive bits that would float away so such that you can't even remember president the pajamas name but you know we didn't know that so it was a very intense time watching him basically supersede the Constitution with his pen and his phone corrupt the government that was the worst thing corruption is so bad because it doesn't matter if you have constitutional government if the IRS is gonna silence you it doesn't matter if you have a First Amendment if the IRS can silence you it doesn't matter if you have the rule of law if the Justice Department is so corrupt that's investigates spying on an opposition candidate it's if the State Department is sending out people to lie to cover up its mistakes in Benghazi it just doesn't matter so that was truly annoying what makes me really sad I must tell you is children young people being schooled in ignorance in our universities so that they no longer know why we believe the things we believe why we have the rules we have why we say free speech I mean you have to go and explain to them that once you shut down somebody's speech that you disagree with then your speech can be shut down and then it all depends on who's got the power to say what ideas are smart and what ideas are stupid that's what that moron in the New York Times doesn't get right once you start to silence people then it's all about who has the power to silence people and we don't want it to be about that we want it to be about free speech free argument ideas exchanging hands so it was much more dangerous during the Obama administration now I'm really sad that some of these people are supporting the socialism that destroys and the and and just don't know why we have the ideas we do from Frank Andrew love your show why do you think the Republicans have done such a horrible job explaining the law regarding detention of immigrant miners they have just said repeatedly it's the law without explaining how all the different areas such as miners and not being allowed expedited removal proceedings the 2016 Ninth Circuit Court ruling and everything else federal Republicans stink when it comes to describing things I mean if you listen to the more the emotionally charged terms that the Democrats and leftist use to sell their bad ideas and then listen to the dull terms that we use to sell our good ideas it is a shame and that is one of the things one of trumps big strengths they say babies and cages babies and cages you turn on MSNBC that's all your babies and cages as if as if children weren't separated from their felonious parents every day across the country that is what you have to do when people commit a felony you have to take their kids away you know they get babies in cages racial profiling that sounds really bad what does that mean it means a cop who is schooled and knows his district knows his beat and looks around that she's a black guy you know hoody who shouldn't be there that he thinks that guy is suspicious I know it because I'm a cop he's not supposed to pretend that the fact that the guy is black didn't have anything to do with it when sometimes it just does but racial profiling sounds bad objectifying women which means a men like beautiful women they like to look at pretty girls that sounds bad we come up with the administrative state right they they build a structure to come and rip your freedom away by Fiat and we call it the administrative state you know I mean that's why that's why things like the deep state you know right wing intellectual say oh with a deep state it sounds like a conspiracy it's emotional you know you've got to appeal to people's emotions somewhat even though especially when you're selling good ideas we're just bad as it bad at it from Veronica there Andrew how does one decide what to do with his her life what's more important God's will skills passions money lifestyle all of the above life is truly overwhelming there are too many options how can I narrow it down when I have many different interests and skills and where does God's will factor into it or is it a factor at all please help really good question God's will is everything in this matter because God has a plan for you not for good but for not for evil but for good he built you with desires those desires get broken and twisted by life by original sin by her history by people teaching you bad stuff and what you're trying to do is get back to the desires that God implanted on you he gained in you he gave you a purpose you know you would seek you first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be given unto you don't go after the money don't go after the fame don't go after hierarchical superiority I don't care what anybody says about that go after the thing that you were made to do and the thing that you were made to do is not see the reason God's will matters is because we get confused about these things we start to think like oh you know I want I want power I want to be President in the United States now you think about do I really am I should I be president the Unites States was that really what I was made to do maybe I was made to be a mom you know maybe I was made to you know be a homemaker what what is it that I'm supposed to do if you're listening to all the things that people tell you you should do and you're not listening to the voice of God who will tell you what he made you for and and will clarify your desires and put you in the right direction prayer really helps with this listening to yourself in an honest way listening even to your dreams looking at your dream your daydreams I mean looking at your daydreams and see like for instance when I was young I thought I wanted to be famous I got kind of famous and I thought like oh yeah I don't really care about this is not what I cared about I always noticed in my daydreams why want to always want to be a writer I was only all I ever wanted was to be a writer in my daydreams as a kid I was always a writer but I was always writing under pseudonyms because it was you know I never I never really wanted to be in the public eye like that I just wanted my books to do well you know and so into paying attention to what you and what God made you for is the way to find out what you do in life it works great by the way and and it can be done don't be overwhelmed take your time it is a blessing it is a blessing that you have so many options so many choices god bless the america god bless the free world that you have so many choices as a young woman I think it's it's it's a wonderful wonderful thing I got to stop there I've come on over my time but let us go to tickety-boo news so one of the things I've been hammering about is the fact that the left has such control over the means of communication that they managed to create the idea that they are far far more powerful than they are Starbucks great example let themselves be cowed by social justice warriors and protest into and to basically admitting that they did something racist when they chased two trespassers off out of their building and called the police on them because they wouldn't pay for anything they wouldn't buy anything as the rules are it were in Starbucks now we find out from the Washington Times Starbucks may have appease progressives with its social justice workshops and open bathroom policy but such moves have failed to caffeinate the company's bottom line the coffee giant stock took a tumble Wednesday after CEO Kevin Johnson announced that Starbucks would close a hundred and fifty company owned stores next year instead of the expected fifty with an emphasis on underperforming shops and densely populated urban areas and lowered growth projections same thing with the NFL Starbucks was an untouchable franchise NFL untouchable Star Wars untouchable start to pump in that social justice warrior stuff and suddenly it's not so untouchable because you know what they're not in the majority I mean people don't want to be like this Tracey Ullman God love her has a hilarious bit and I noticed that like you couldn't get it on YouTube for a while now it's up there but I don't know if they're I don't know if they're shutting it down or not but she had a thing where she has a woke support group for people who are so woke they can't enjoy their lives and the thing that's so important about this is what when these voices start coming out and they start becoming popular and people she is a in England a very very well respected comedienne she really can be hilarious when this stuff comes out they start we start to realize oh you know most people feel like this most people laugh at this stuff just because they're the ones doing the shouting doesn't mean they have the power or we should give them the power take a look at this it is hilarious okay everyone welcome this support group is for people who are so worked they are finding it impossible to have any fun at all we have somebody new with us this week so would you like to introduce yourself hi I'm Oscar I think like a lot of you guys for me it started with the little things saying an online petition going into a March well I mean before I knew I was writing to the Guardian about LGBT representation in the Harry Potter books which is shocking by the way all right lady we've all read your blog don't worry Oscar you've come to the right place all of the young people in this room are ruining their lives by being overly virtuous that's actually a microaggression to say young people because it carries subconscious bias towards the elderly actually what you're doing is denying agency to the elderly which is arguably much worse this is what I'm talking about it's a slippery slope one minute you're carrying a reusable water bottle fine and the next minute you're arguing that water is racist oh my god is water racist no no it's just an example right how did you guys get on with the homework but I set you guys is known especially inclusive term not now Jamie bye homework do you mean having to watch that old people sitcom it's called friends lily and you are supposed to watch it and enjoy it well I try but I find it deeply problematic why well there's the homophobia the transphobia the fascism and the slut-shaming and could Chandler be any more annoying you can't go through your 20s worrying about every aspect of everything you have to pick your battles and just remember that it doesn't really matter because by the time you hit your 30s most of you are going to be massively right-wing anyway have any of you started to think that maybe poor people don't deserve benefits no I'll watch out for that one because that's how it starts a love I understand this has all been a bit much for some of you so let's take five and have a whole mob I find the word hobnob very phallocentric we couldn't play that last line but it's the funniest line in the video listen if the culture starts the shift and this is like what I've been the drama I've been beating now for twenty years but if the culture this sort of thing starts to shift then then we can keep our freedom alive for another generation and even another one after that I do believe we will I do believe we can I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Klavan show I will see you again tomorrow the Andrew Clavin show is
