well hello there and welcome we have many things to discuss today among them Facebook under fire Democrats attacking a children's book for no reason at all and will technology kill us all I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay so I'm gonna do this I never do this but I'm gonna take just one moment event because let me tell you the last 24 hours they've been garbaggio now listen I'm perfectly well happy to be here in Pennsylvania I'm speaking at Susquehanna University tonight they're supposed to be protesters people are very upset that I'm coming yada yada that's how it always goes the last night I had to fly into Atlanta I know first world problems but I get in there there in the middle of a tornado warning and then I have to stop at a hotel that let's just say was not five-star it's the kind of hotel where you wake up at two o'clock in the morning and you really haven't gone to sleep and you're just feeling like garbage and you need some water because there's no water in the room because the last time anybody cleaned the room was three years ago and so you saunter on over to that that special vending machine just down the hall you know right past those three doors that people have been slamming the entire night and you know that the guy next door has been listening to a gym keep watching a Jim Carrey movie because you can hear through the paper-thin walls anyway you saunter on over to that vending machine and you say you know what I'll get myself some water and really chill out and then you get to the vending machine and you realize the only options are coca-cola sprite and mello Yello and you think to yourself did I somehow stumble into a portal and then of course we have the technological problems of today shows but don't worry we have so many things to get to actual real news not just me being in mode but about the situation let's just say that the high life is not always what it's cracked up to be but first I want to say thank you to our

it's also been the folks over at Facebook so right now the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the use of personal data from 50 million Facebook users by Cambridge analytic Avaya lated a consent decree that the tech company signed with the agency in 2011 according Bloomberg so if you recall all the way back to yesterday's show there was a report in the UK Guardian suggesting that the folks at Cambridge analytical which was the data analysis firm the data gathering firm for the Trump campaign that they hadn't listened together 50 million Facebook users now there's nothing illegal about what they did apparently what they did is they gathered a bunch of data from Facebook users who had taken a personality quiz and then they'd use those personality quizzes they obtained that data they did cross-reference that personality quiz data with supposed politics and this was a work of heart-rending genius right this is what won Trump the election it didn't when Trump the election by the way Trump won the election because Hillary was an unbelievably crappy handed it and Trump campaigned in the right places okay it wasn't because there are a bunch of people who came for general etiquette hacking your Facebook data or anything like this this is just nonsense if you've played farmville on Facebook they're gathering your information if you shop online they're gathering your information ever wonder how it is that the ads on your Google are tailored to you right you just bought something from Amazon and voila there's another ad from Amazon that's because everybody online is always gathering information about you to make sure that they can sell you things that's how online works hey there's nothing terrible that happened so far as I can see yet maybe there will be new evidence of something quite terrible but the left is going crazy because again they're trying to set up a particular narrative here so a spokesman for the FTC is saying quote we are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating we take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving Google Facebook said Tuesday it receives a letter from the FTC with questions but had not been informed of a formal probe if these were all found to be violations if it turns out that Facebook had been willfully violating its own consent decree it would cost them $40,000 per violation if you were talking about tens of millions of violations then you're talking about presumably billions billions of dollars in violations you basically bankrupt the company if this ended up being a serious issue but it really isn't okay these weekend reports allege that Facebook users allegedly willingly provided their data to a psychology quiz app and then the people who made that quiz that passed the data along to Cambridge analytical without the users knowledge constituting a potential violation okay whatever that is not a big deal I'm sorry I'm not gonna pretend that I think that it's a huge deal if firms that are gathering data on you market that data at other firms if this is how online works again people who are ignorant about how online works the reason that you are you are seeing all those ads is because people put cookies on your browser this is this is all ridiculous hey shares of Facebook fell five percent Tuesday after skating as much as eight percent on Monday and now apparently Mark Zuckerberg having a meeting but he's not going so Facebook's Bureau they're their staff is having a meeting the chief executive of Facebook according to the Guardian Mark Zuckerberg has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since The Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users personal data even as this company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation following stock prices in a social media campaigns who delete facebook Facebook shares slid 7 percent on Monday following the news knocking 36 billion dollars off the company's valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations according to the UK Guardian Zuckerberg owns 16 percent of the company and he personally saw his fortune fall 5.5 billion to 69 billion oh poor baby can the embattled social media company announced on Monday it would engage in a digital forensics firm to kondeh to conduct an audit of Cambridge analytical to determine whether the firm or not still has copies of the data in question hey does this sound like anything awful happen well let you let you be the judge okay here's the deal okay for years all we heard after 2012 is that one of the reasons that MIT Romney lost is because the data operation for the GOP sucked I was there I remember this was the talking point the talking point is that MIT Romney did not have the necessary data operation in order to ensure that everything was going to go okay okay and then in Barack Obama's data team by the way was praised as these wonderful world breaking geniuses in fact flashback to 2012 Maxine Waters that another world breaking genius she was talking back in 2012 about how Barack Obama had done it and she said he gather data on everyone via Facebook Wow put in place an organization that contains the kind of database that no one has ever seen before in life that's going to be very very powerful and whoever the organizing for America that he's now shifting to become a 501 C 4 yeah that's right that's right and that database will have information about everything on every individual in ways that it's never been done before and whoever runs for president on the Democratic ticket have to deal with that and yet no one found that creepy how magical it's amazing it's like when Democrats were engaging in micro targeting and giant swaths of gated data gathering everybody just looked the other way Wow I can't believe it in fact one of the publications that looked the other way not only look the other way but praised the Obama campaign was you guess it the UK Guardian in 2012 they reported that President Obama's re-election team was quote building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans but the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before whoa I mean that sounds exactly like what Trump's team was doing oh my goodness that must have been nefarious then but no it was about about the Guardian talking about the world breaking genius of the Obama team again building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to degree never before achieved according to the Guardian Obama's new database would be gathered by individual volunteers who to log on to Obama's re-election site using their Facebook credentials consciously or otherwise okay again the entire claim here is that the Trump campaign gathered data on people who weren't consciously aware that their NATO is being gathered here's the Guardian in 2012 quote consciously or otherwise the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they start publicly on their Facebook page home locations date of birth interests and crucially network of friends directly into the central Obama database Facebook had no problem with any of this but they do now there's a reason for this again the former Obama director of integration and media analytics said during the 2012 campaign Facebook allowed the Obama team to quote suck out the whole social graph Facebook quote was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph but they didn't stop us once they realized that what what we were that was what we were doing and then this is this woman added quote they came to the office in the days following the election recruiting and were very candid in they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side not so with Trump of course as soon as Facebook realized the Cambridge analytic I had pursued a similar strategy they suspended the firm none of this is surprising because it's all part of a larger and greater agenda that larger and larger and greater agenda as I suggested yesterday is that Democrats think that Trump should not have won in order to prevent future Trump from winning they're going to prevent conservatives from getting out their message they're going to prevent data mining by Republicans but they will allow it for Democrats they're going to prevent conservative websites like The Daily wire from distributing our material they'll build algorithms to prevent that distribution they'll similar that they will at the same time benefit a bunch of left-wing organizations that are doing exactly the same kind of journalism that we are just on the other side Democrats have been using the Trump election as a way to browbeat social media companies that were supposed to be open sources into censoring conservatives that's what this is all about that's the agenda here the agenda here has been clear for months the agenda here is the Democrats who have been claiming with no evidence whatsoever that it was social media manipulation that won Trump the election and therefore Facebook YouTube Google Twitter these all have to be regulated he's off to be brought to heel this is specifically designed to cause the heads of those firms who by the way are all horrified that Trump won write Zuckerberg is horrified and Jack Dorsey at Twitter is horrified the heads of Google Eric Schultz he was part of the Obama team all the people at Google were horrified right nobody at any of these companies wanted Trump to win and they don't want any part of being blamed for Trump winning so they're using this as an impetus to basically censor conservatives this is the next step so a year and a half ago there was a lot of talk about Facebook algorithms preventing conservative topics from trending and Zuckerberg met with a bunch of conservatives including my friend Glenn Beck and he believed Tucker Carlson a bunch of people and to talk about shifting his algorithm and according to Wired that was all an attempt to sort of buy off the press prevent conservatives from whining about it too much well now they don't care whether conservatives whine about it they've just decided they're gonna cater to Democrats by essentially shutting down all these mechanisms for conservatives Senate Democrats have trotted out a bunch of pathetic Russian created memes on Facebook viewed by a handful of human beings right and as an excuse for Hillary Clinton's loss they've suggested that this is why Hillary Clinton lost those things we showed them on the show they're pathetic never seen by five people they spent the Russians in the entire election cycle on Facebook so don't spend something like $100,000 on Facebook you know honest-to-goodness small companies spend tens of thousands of dollars a month marketing on Facebook that was a giant nothing burger but the Democrats are claiming it to something burger because of course they want to use that as an excuse to Club all of these social media companies into submission they also claimed without evidence that fake news had swamp Facebook we've heard nothing about nothing but fake news for two years now Oh Trump only won because of fake news because people are reading headlines that weren't real we've had article after article about this the problem of fake news what the Democrats mean by fake news is news that is slanted to the right right commentary that is slanted to the right interpreted to the right they don't like that stuff not just stuff that's outright false nobody likes the stuff that's outright false but instead of just banning the stuff that's outright false Mark Zuckerberg has gone further right Mark Zuckerberg has decided that he is going to cleanse his network of all stuff that would remotely be construed as conservative in February Wired magazine ran a cover story specifically dealing with Facebook's role in the election of 2016 and their subsequent attempts to fix the problem after the election Zuckerberg the head of Facebook met with Barack Obama after the election when Obama was no longer the president and he met with Barack Obama I'll tell you in one second what exactly he said a Barack Obama because it's stunning and it shows that what I'm saying about this quasi conspiracy theory is not a conspiracy theory this is all out in the open I'll explain in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at zip recruiter so if you're

exactly did Zuckerberg meet with Obama about here is what Zuckerberg met with Obama about hey you ready after you the election Zuckerberg met with Obama in an attempt to convince Obama he was serious about stopping the misuse of the platform by misuse supposedly this meant fake news and Russian intervention really what it meant is that Obama and the rest of the left were suggesting that Republicans had gotten good at social media because guess what we have a we at Daily wire are very good at social media we have a social media team we have people who work on Facebook every single day and Facebook decided they wanted to quash everybody right this is there this is their goal in February Zuckerberg said he wanted to rejigger the algorithms on his platform to benefit content that Facebook deems trustworthy informative and local there's the translation trustworthy informative in local that means Democrat Democrat and Democrat Wired celebrated court you can't make the world more open and connected if you're breaking it apart so what was the result of Facebook's algorithmic news change conservatives have been absolutely destroyed a study from the Western Journal found conservative sites have lost an average of 14 percent of all their Facebook traffic left his sights on average cite minor increase and this even held true for major publications not stuff like The Daily wire but two of the New York newspapers right the New York Daily News saw a bump rides the left wing will outlet they saw a bump of nearly 25 percent in facebook traffic the New York Post they dropped 12 percent that is the goal here that's the entire goal this isn't really in any serious way about anything except for forcing social media platforms to move to the left and social media wanting to demonstrate just how wonderful they are by moving to the left in order to head off Democrats and make themselves feel better about the fact that Trump was elected president that's all this is there's a reason that Twitter has suspended all right racist but continues to promote Louis Farrakhan there's a reason that YouTube is being sued by Prager University for D monetizing all of its videos there's a reason that Google used to automatic fact-checking on right-wing sites like this when we discussed it on the show but did no such thing for left-wing sites is a radical rejecting in social media the reason I use Facebook the reason I use Google the reason I used YouTube the reason I use Twitter is because these are open sources because the whole goal here is that these were neutral arbiters these were not people who are going to interpose themselves between you and the news you want to see I'm emails every single day from users over at Facebook we're saying that we used to chop in their newsfeed and now we no longer do and they want to know how to fix it we have a video by the way over at YouTube and Facebook where you can see how to fix your newsfeed so you're actually getting our headlines again but the goal here is very obvious there's a reason Democrats are gonna continue focusing on nonsense stories like the Cambridge analytic a story it's all about creating a cloud cover so that creating a base of fire so that the so that to suppress conservatives that's all this is its suppression of effect it's a suppression attempt against conservatives on all of these major social media outlets and here's going to be the final solution on all this the end solution here is going to be either regulation of these companies or beginning new companies I think beginning new companies is probably gonna happen in relatively short order I've heard rumors to that effect from some pretty major folks that there will be rivals to YouTube there will be rivals to Facebook that that these companies in their attempt to shut down free and open exchange of ideas in their attempt to prevent views that they don't like from being disseminated they're driving away a huge percentage of their audience and this is really important stuff because so many people get their news from Facebook right now it's like well over 50 percent of the of the people in the United States get their news from Facebook well Facebook is censoring us but not censoring the New York Times you're only getting one element of the news and again one elements of the news and that's really a scary thing and they shouldn't be policing how you receive information this is the same thing they're doing on campuses by the way when they say that I shouldn't speak the D platforming is the way of preventing dissent they can't debate us they don't want to have conversations so instead they just say well you must be cheating somehow you're doing something so nefarious that we can't even let you anywhere close to the to the free and open exchange of ideas get out of here is this scary stuff it should be scary stuff at least for Americans who are worried about leftist overreach because it come on I mean this is just it's just bad stuff okay now speaking I've leftist overreach in general leftist nastiness so yesterday we played an interview that I did with Charlotte pence Charlotte pence is the charming 24 year old daughter of the vice president of the United States mics in States Mike Pence and Charlotte had a new book they came out and her new book was about her bunny okay the the it was called Marlin Bundys day in the life of the vice president very innocent very nice book I read it's my four-year-old daughter it's very charming it's a political Charlotte is not a political player her sister is not really political player her brother is not a political player you know Mike Pence is political that doesn't mean that his kids are political that doesn't stop the left so John Oliver who has apparently decided to make a living out of being an insufferable douchebag hey he came out on HBO and not only ripped pens he then launched a rival children's book against Charlotte pence his children's book about a bunny because this is how nasty so many of the folks on the Left have become now while in many ways pence is like any other Trump employee ethically compromised creeps the cowboy jared and subjected to all sorts of unwanted physical contact pence is constitutionally the only official in the White House that Trump can't fire the first tell-all book to come out of the current White House is hopping into bookstores Marlin bundo the pet rapid a vice president Mike Pence there we also wrote a book about Mike Pence's Rapids that has also been published in fact right now okay and the book that they created was a day in the life of Marlin bundo and this book is a book about a gay bunny who's being victimized by a creature called stink bug who's supposed to be drawn like Mike Pence because of course Mike Pence hates gay people again I'm waiting for the evidence that Mike Pence hates gay people but people on the Left just keep suggesting it over and over so I suppose it must be true now what's even worse is that john oliver then sicked all of his friends onto onto charlotte Pence's amazon page so her Amazon page got spammed with nasty reviews so not from people who had actually bought all of the had actually bought her book but from all of the people who were buying John Oliver's books they all went over there they spammed her site with a bunch of one-star reviews on a nice friendly apolitical children's book okay this is the charming left they have to attack Mike Pence's daughters children's but now what's amazing about this is that Chelsea Clinton wrote a children's book also the right basically left it alone okay her children's book was an openly political book it was called she persisted it wasn't a book about like an animal in the White House and here's what the Vice President does all day it was a book about how Hillary Clinton persisted and women persist and girl power and all this kind of stuff right that was political the right basically left it alone because hey it's Chelsea Clinton should we really make a big deal out of it okay the left could not even leave alone a book about a bunny they couldn't even leave alone a book about a bunny because so much of the left's viewpoint is now consumed with the idea that if you disagree with them that you are a bad person that you are a terrible awful no good very bad person so I'm supposed to speak at Susquehanna college tonight and one of the things that I want to talk about is exactly this this this tendency on a part of people on the left to attribute nasty motivations to people on the right we've seen it throughout the gun debate by the way I've seen it over and over throughout the gun debate actually but it's not just with regard to the gun debate I mean we'll show you one clip with regard to gun debate so here is David Hogg who's become again just insufferable he's one of these parkland students obviously again for the one millionth time I feel terrible that he witnessed tragedy but here he is talking about politicians being the this is his words the because of the NRA what if our politicians weren't the bit of the NRA it doesn't make sense that I have to wait till I'm 21 to get a handgun but I could get this weapon what if we all voted and said this is not okay it was an incredibly exciting election night in a district there never should have been a question that the Republicans should have won they're sending a Democrat from the heart of Trump country voters okay so now David hog is is openly stumping for he's openly something for Democrats in the way he's doing that is by claiming that everybody who disagrees with them is a the NRA if this sort of talk is not good for the country it doesn't allow us to have conversations with one another there's an open letter written by a student at Susquehanna to me upon my speech tonight and it's just again astonishingly stupid okay here is what this this guy writes he's a student over at Susquehanna college and he's doing this at Susquehanna University and he's doing the same thing his name is no one at Nightingale and and in just a second I'm gonna read you what Nolan nightingale has to say about me arriving at Susquehanna because obviously I'm a bad guy because we disagree and I will show you that this is how he feels and again this is terrible for the country first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at movement watches so movement is just fantastic they don't just sell watches by the way they also sell sunglasses so this watch right here

slash shapiro for that special 15% off deal join the movement today ok so here is the letter from this student over at Susquehanna University warning the rest of the campus an open letter to me personally so I will respond personally here's what he says dear mr. Shapiro I'm a student at Susquehanna University and a proud one at that if that name sounds familiar to you it's because you are scheduled to speak here on March 20th of this year you were invited by the Young Republicans Club a young group of people who are by all means reasonable and relatively nice I've grown up with around Republicans all my life my parents whom I love very much our Republicans there's nothing wrong with level-headed Republicans a large amount of the people coming to see you speak are not level-headed Republicans the people I'm about to describe should be the kind of scum that gets you riled up when you hear that they dare to claim to belong to the same group as you of course you do now you do not announce these people at least publicly because they are your bread and butter okay so already he's inviting me for denouncing a group of people he hasn't described yet so who are these nefarious folks who are showing up to my speeches supposedly these evil cruel people I refuse to denounce he describes them your fan base are people who have sent death threats to the faculty of my school simply because we ran out of tickets for them to see you are they because if so they should stop being awful people don't send death threats to faculty because you can't see one of my shows but I don't have any evidence of this and I have a fairly solid belief that this kid doesn't have a lot of evidence of this either like has he actually tracked down the people who wrote these nasty notes doesn't even have access to those notes does your fan base are the people that are making my friends lock themselves in their rooms on the day that you're here for fear of their lives really my fan base because I'm fairly certain that the death threats have been all issued against me which is why I have to travel with a large security team and why they are now gonna spend a bunch of money to bring police officers out there that ain't my fans that's the folks over nante fuh aren't susquehanna rising which is one of these groups that is claimed that they want to try to shut down the event by the way I my full expectation is that these are Fairweather protesters it's really cold outside it's snowing so if they show up more power to them but what then he says your fan base are the same people who went through this campus last year scrawling F free-world F is a slur for gay people on the sidewalk in drawing swastikas on everything they see those are my fans what in the world like where are you getting this do they saw that they write Shapiro and then a swastika like are you an idiot I wear a yarmulke I'm an Orthodox Jew I was the leading victim of anti-semitism on the on the right in well in all of Jewish journalism in 2016 from the all right what the hell are you talking about and I refuse to condemn these people again the whole goal of this article is to make it seem like I am a nefarious fellow because he can't actually find anything nefarious that I've done instead what he likes to do is claim that I'm responsible for a bunch of people who I've openly denounced for years and then he says I find the last one almost comically hypocritical given the fact that you are a man of Jewish faith what I don't condemn people who draw swastikas what are you insane but hey how many fans of Mya Annapolis do you think are also big fans of any gay people they meet in real life I'm not gonna talk about Milo in his fans I've been criticizing Milo for two years what the hell they says this is not to say you are responsible for the actions of your fans right I'm not and also if they do bad things I think they're Jack Jack wagons cuz this is not even to say that these people represent all of your fans hell my little brother's a huge fan of yours he's far from those monsters I just described this is however to call attention to the fact that if those people are the ones supporting the beliefs that you espouse maybe it's time to re-evaluate those beliefs okay no that's not how this works okay just because they're a bunch of people who may be fans of mine and may be jerks does not mean that my belief system is wrong it means that they're jerks there are lots of jerks on all sides of the aisle hey I would promise you the people who are rioting across the country in places like Ferguson and Baltimore our fans of Barack Obama's policies does that mean that Obama's policies are necessarily wrong of course not in fact when a Bernie Sanders supporter shot up a congressional baseball game I was the first one out there saying this is not bird Sandra's vault right why is it Bernie Sanders's fault that there's a nutjob who follows his ideas okay if the implementation of your ideas causes death if the implementation of your ideas causes tyranny then we can talk about whether your ideas are wrong but just because some people who agree with you happen to be bad human beings doesn't mean that you are responsible for their evil or that you're a bad human being there's just a nasty form of guilt by association that the left is associated with and this is what they're doing and this is what folks on the left are doing increasingly late john oliver attacking charlotte pence why she happens to be related to the Vice President of the United States David hog suggesting that anyone who's a member of the NRA is in favor of child death like even when I was on CNN on Sunday with brian Stelter there was one point where Stelter said to me you know is it is it really a set I'm saying you're biased right CNN is biased against gun rights and he said is it really a sin that we want to stop gun violence the implication being that if you're in favor of gun rights you don't want to stop gun violence and I said like what what are you talking about what in the world are you talking about but again this is just another demonstration of the radicalism that has overtaken so much of the Democratic Party character attacks are first on the list of things to do rather than last on the list of tactics to use Democratic radicalism has really gotten extreme again these are the same people who are endorsing keith Ellison who's endorsing Louis Farrakhan as same people claiming that my fans are the problem are out there pretending that the heads of the women's March can hang out who was Farrakhan no problem that keith Ellison who has nearly made the head of the DNC is not a problem either speaking of keith Ellison by the way he is a career-long anti-semite with longtime associations with the Nation of Islam's anti-semite extraordinaire Louis Farrakhan while on Monday depending on article at medium complaining about the media's coverage of connections between top Democrats in Farrakhan the Ellison's article didn't take responsibility for association with in defense of Farrakhan instead he suggested that people like me were attempting to drive a rift between the Jewish and black communities which is just like you endorsed in open anti-semite because you said that he's for black rights and then you accuse me of driving a rift between black people and Jewish people but this is the game and this is the game that the left is consistently playing it's quite insane right Ellison says stuff like this he says over the last few weeks some political opponents have been pushing the narrative that I'm somehow connected to a man named Louis Farrakhan not true really it's not true here's CNN on Keith Alison's associations ACN nkf I'll review of Ellison's past writings and public statements during the late 1980s through the 1990s reveal his decade-long involvement in the Nation of Islam and his repeated defense of Farrakhan and other radical black leaders against accusations of anti-semitism and columns and statements to the press at CNN it ain't me Nicki thelusson defended Kwame turn thou be Stokely Carmichael in 1990 after Carmichael made a speech stating quote scientism must be destroyed in 1995 keith Ellison helped organize an event and when she spoke before Kali to Abdul Muhammad an anti-semite so rabid the Nation of Islam kicked him out that same year Ellison wrote quote Minister Farrakhan is a role model for black youth he is not an anti-semite he said the same thing in 1997 according to the Daily Caller Farrakhan attended at least three meetings with Ellison okay three including one in the last couple of years now Farrakhan said on his own show that he met Ellison in Farah Khan's hotel room in December 2016 along with representative Andre Carson okay but that's not hateful what's hateful is to point this out it really is an astonishing thing and this shows the radicalism of Democrats and it also demonstrates why they have to make character attacks because if they're forced to defend their character on this kind of stuff they're gonna fail every single time okay so before we go any further and I do want to talk about a bevy of

so in other news the CDC is is issuing a stunning report about youth suicide and it does say something about where we stand as a country according to the Centers for Disease Control youth suicide is in the middle of a precipitous really frightening skyrocketing rate in suicide between 2006 and 2016 suicides by white kids between 10 and 17 jumped 70 percent 7-0 black kids are less likely than white kids to kill themselves this is true generally black folks are less likely to commit suicide than white folks but their suicide rate actually jumped even more it jumped 77% the blaze points out that CNN reported last year the suicide rate among girls between the ages of 15 and 19 rose to a 40-year high in 2015 and it's not just young people Tom Simon is a CDC report author and he said quote we know that overall in the u.s. we're seeing increases in suicide rates across all age groups as of 2016 suicide levels were at 30-year high so what the hell is going on right we have material prosperity so they're a bunch of theories about why the suicide rate has been skyrocketing theory number one is that the suicide rate has been rising because the economy was bad in 2007-2008 and the evidence for that is really not there because what you would have expected is that the suicide rate would mirror the economy economic decline in 2007-2008 would go like this would actually be reverse right it can't go like this suicide rate would go like this and then as the economy started to rise the suicide rate would start going down that's not what happened at all the suicide rate has continued to rise then there are people who blame the rise of suicide on drugs I particularly opioids but according to a study from the National Institute of drug abuse drinking smoking and drug use may be at the lowest level seen in decades among teenagers so it's actually going down so what exactly is happening I think that the solution is is not something that a lot of folks on the Left are going to like but I think that it's pretty obvious if you look at polls on human happiness if you look at polls on people finding meaning in their lives I mean like cosmic meaning in their lives it is highly correlative with religious practice so according to the Atlantic right not a right-wing source they cited a study in Psychological Science it said this quote the researchers found that this factor of religiosity mediated the relationship between a country's wealth and the perceived meaning in its citizens lives meaning that it was the presence of religion that largely accounted for the gap between money and meaning people in the West largely find find meaning in materialism this is true for people on the left and the right Marxists say that all human meaning can be found in rectifying income inequality a lot of folks on these sort of libertarian rights suggest that material wealth and prevalence of human freedoms provide people meaning that has not held true throughout human history so this study analyzed a bunch of other factors education fertility rates individualism social support to see if they could explain the findings in the end only one factor mattered it was religion in other words people need meaning and purpose in life our focus on materialism on both sides is not going to fill this gap that's been left by God when God died so did a piece of us right this isn't the problem that can be cured by redistributing X boxes there's a problem the human sould now this doesn't mean you have to head on over to the church and they have to become a deeply religious member of an organized religious sect it does mean you have to put aside spiritual but not religious spiritual doesn't come with action points okay people need action points and people are notoriously bad at defining their own meaning I know there's been this moral relativistic streak that is characterized post-enlightenment thought in the West that there's good and there's bad but it's really up to you and is the line from city slickers and city slickers Billy Crystal's going through a midlife crisis and he goes out with his friends Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby all the way out to the desert know when he gets out to the desert he meets up with curly and curly is a played by Jack Palance and Jack Palance gives him the meaning of life he says the meaning of life is one thing and then he dives before he can say what the one thing is what is the one thing and Palance basically says well that's for you to find out well except that human beings aren't really bad at this human beings are not good at finding out what their meaning is human beings need to be told that they have a special meaning in the universe a special place before God they're made in God's image they have intense value and that even the mundane things they do in life have a deeper lasting impact beyond themselves right that people do need that and it's it's really weird to me that so many people on the Left deny this I understand they think that religion has been an obstacle to human growth which I don't see the evidence for you know I know that they believe that that religion has been an obstacle to the scientific development which again has not been true historically speaking there are times when religion has been an obstacle that overall religion is actually in a spur for most of human history at least in in the West that said the I explained all of us in my upcoming book actually that said there's a lack of meaning that is in American society and I think it's coming to a head right now now speaking of lack of meaning and and devastating events today there was another school shooting this time in Maryland high school and this one was actually rather instructive because a resource officer fired at the high school shooter who was fatally shot so three individuals including the shooter were shot according to a local reporter Peggy Fox Sheriff Tim Cameron confirmed that it should incur this morning in a hallway by a great mental student who's eventually engaged by an armed resource officer the shooter reportedly fired at a female student and another student was hit an armed school resource officer that engaged the shooter with a firearm so this is what should have happened at Parkland instead it happened in Maryland and prevented further death this does give the lie to the idea that a good guy with a gun cannot stop a bad guy with a gun so good for the school resource officer for doing the right thing again disproving the argument that guns are inherently bad now speaking of technologies that have been blamed as inherently bad well they're not inherently bad there's a lot of hubbub in the last couple of days over this autonomous uber so here is the story apparently there's a woman who was killed because she was why she basically she's a homeless woman in Arizona and she jumped in front of a car the car was in autonomous driving uber and now this has created all sorts of problems for uber there's been a lot of talk about pulling these autonomously burrs off the market that somehow this is going to make the roads safer okay here's the story though here's the rest of the story according to the Daily Mail the female driver who was in control that self driving uber when it hit and killed a homeless woman in Arizona is a convicted felon who claims the victim stepped out in front of his car suddenly giving her no time to try to avoid her Rafaela Vasquez was responsible for the vehicle when struck in lane Herzberg 49 on Sunday night in Tempe Arizona she previously spent four years in prison for armed robbery and falsifying documents was hired by uber anyway on Sunday night the car was in self-driving mode when it struck Herzberg Vasquez was supposed to act as a safety driver and take control of the vehicle if anything went wrong she told police that her Berg could spend time in prison for drug offenses stepped out in front of her with a bicycle carrying multiple shopping bags and she had no time to brake before it hit her but she was traveling at 40 miles per hour at the time well within the 40 mile 45 mile per hour speed limit she insisted she was alert but nothing could have been done to stop the crash the police basically agreed her story supported by footage of the cameras fitted at the front and back of the Volvo SUV the reason that I'm bringing up this story is because there's a lot of alarmism about the machines are going to kill us all there's been a lot of talk about we're all going to die because of the rise of the machines and all this sort of nonsense this is not going to be true okay there are 40,000 Auto mode auto mobile deaths last year virtually all of them or due to human error machines are better at this stuff than human beings are now I know there's been a lot of talk about truck drivers gonna go out of business and so many people won't be able to drive anymore and what are we gonna do but all this really is in essence is Luddite ISM what happens this lady is terrible but it sounds like it would happen whether it was a human driver or an automated driver again machines are very good at these types of things and the and the roads will be a lot safer when there are more machines on them rather than more human beings because people are notoriously bad at driving they just suck at it plus we're texting anyway so better that we should be texting while not driving then that we should be texting and driving at the same time okay so but now it's time for me to do some things I like and some things that I hate so a quick thing I like so this movie I had a chance to watch a couple of days ago I there's no doubt after watching this movie the Margot Robbie should have won Best Actress over Frances McDormand who I thought was overrated in three billboards the movie was I Tania it's quite good it's it's quite a good film it's quite an effective film and and Margot Robbie really connect which is it's always a it's always sort of a shock when a woman who I believe started off as a model and something a very good actress but she's actually a terrific actress so here she is in I Tania Tania tell the truth there's no such thing as truth everyone has their own truth I was the best figure skater in the world at one point in time call out a clean skate stop talking to her that girl is your enemy Jeff was my first date ever and my mom came so the film is actually quite good it's really effective and they tried to turn it into a critique of American life and and how viewers treat ice skating they want all these these women not to have real lives and all the rest of the sort of stuff the real story is Tonya Harding had a wonderful mother and also had a horrible ex-husband and her ex-husband according to the movie at least plan the hit on Nancy Kerrigan basically himself along with an idiot friend of his it's hard to watch but it is entertaining so it's it feels like Goodfellas I mean that's sort of the feel of the movie even though the two movies have nothing else in common except for a very very good soundtrack there's there's a bunch of great songs on the soundtrack too I Tanya so while we're checking out much better than the shape of water I would have to do a full critique of shape of water tomorrow because I watched it once I thought it sucked and I was on the plane yesterday and I thought maybe I'll try this again and see if I really think it sucks I mean I just won Best Picture maybe I got this all wrong I was wrong the movie is so bad I wanted to walk off the plane it is that bad a movie it is in my in my opinion one of the five worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life I will do a full critique of it tomorrow because it's just absolute hogwash garbage yuck oh yeah in them great art direction and the script is written by an angry sjw ten-year-old and crayon it's just garbage okay time for a quick thing that I hate okay so Jim Carrey who has lost his mind or whatever it was left of it he also has decided that he's going to go into portrait painting so he painted this portrait of Sarah Huckabee Sanders and here's what it looks like yeah obviously he he loves Sarah Huckabee Sanders very clearly so he he said quote this is the portrait of a so-called Christian whose only purpose in life is to lie for the wicked monstrous just just wonderful I'm sure the Jim Carrey himself is wonderful Christian and in a great tribute to two people of religion everywhere you know the nastiness that's inherent in this is pretty obvious this kind of art is fairly typical but again it's all about the people you disagree with politically must be bad human beings if he wants to say that she bad because she lies for the president I guess that's his you know it's his prerogative and he could then make a case for why that is the case you know I don't think it's good to lie for the president either but I get the feeling that whether or not Sarah Huckabee Sanders were telling untruths on behalf of the president he would've said the same thing about Dana Perino because this is just what the left has become it's all about character attacks and maligning other people's character as opposed to actually standing up for an agenda okay we'll be back here at tomorrow tomorrow we're gonna be broadcasting from Washington DC in a very special place I will tell you about it when we get there I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring
