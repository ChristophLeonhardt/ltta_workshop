00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:17,566
>> Tucker: LESS THAN 10 MILES

2
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,868
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, A MIDDLE

3
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:22,271
SCHOOL IS BEING TERRORIZED BY

4
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:22,571
MS-13.

5
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:23,505
IT'S CALLED A WILLIAM WORK

6
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:26,508
MIDDLE SCHOOL IN MARYLAND.

7
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:28,310
IT'S ONE OF MANY THAT HAS HAD A

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,279
MASS SETTLEMENT OF UNACCOMPANIED

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,548
MINORS ENTERING THE COUNTRY FROM

10
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:32,982
LATIN AMERICA.

11
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,049
ACCORDING TO

12
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,050
"THE WASHINGTON POST," MS-13

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,051
MEMBERS IN THE SCHOOL START

14
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:39,922
FIGHTS, SELL DRUGS AND ASSAULT

15
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,656
FELLOW STUDENTS.

16
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:41,357
TEACHERS SAY THEY FEAR BEING

17
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:43,058
ALONE WITH SOME OF THESE KIDS

18
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,627
AND ALSO FEARS SAYING ANYTHING

19
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,295
ABOUT IT BECAUSE SPEAKING OUT

20
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:48,263
COULD COST THEM THEIR JOBS.

21
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:49,965
THE TRAGEDY CAN ALMOST BE TRACED

22
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:50,866
ENTIRELY TO THE IMMIGRATION

23
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:55,904
POLICY BUT, MOST CRUSHED THE

24
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:58,240
CONVERSATION BY SCREAMING

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,244
"RACIST."

26
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:05,848
JOSE RIST A WRIST IS FORMER DNC

27
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:07,216
PRESS SECRETARY.

28
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:08,484
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

29
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:11,420
WHAT I FOUND IRONIC ABOUT THE

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,554
STORY WAS, THIS IS THE THIRD

31
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:17,259
ITERATION OF THE MS-13 STORY.

32
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,595
FIRST WE WERE TOLD IT WAS A

33
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:20,829
FIGMENT OF THEIR IMAGINATION.

34
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:24,667
THEN WE WERE TOLD TO ATTACK THEM

35
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:30,339
AND CALL THEM NAMES IS IMMORAL.

36
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:33,108
AND THEN ARE WE ALLOWED TO

37
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,243
ACKNOWLEDGE THEY ARE TERRORIZING

38
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:36,445
THE STUDENTS OR ARE WE BIGOTS

39
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:37,246
FOR DOING SO?

40
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:38,914
>> IF YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED IN

41
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:40,749
THIS COUNTRY, IF YOU ARE A

42
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:42,451
CRIMINAL INCLUDING BEING A

43
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,752
MEMBER OF MS-13, WE DON'T WANT

44
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:44,420
YOU IN THIS COUNTRY AND YOU

45
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,455
SHOULD BE DEPORTED.

46
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:48,857
PART OF THE ISSUE HERE IS PEOPLE

47
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:49,892
LIKE YOURSELF AND SOME

48
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,860
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PINPOINT AND

49
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,829
SIMPLY SAY, BECAUSE YOUR FIRST

50
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,964
NAME IS JOSE, OR YOU ARE LATINO,

51
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:59,068
LIKE ME, YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY

52
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,269
AND MS-13 GANG MEMBER.

53
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,071
>> Tucker: YOU ARE A

54
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,839
RIDICULOUS PERSON FOR SAYING

55
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,074
THAT, I HAVE NEVER SUGGESTED

56
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:06,842
ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND IT'S

57
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,078
APPALLING THAT YOU SHOULD SAY

58
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:09,511
THAT.

59
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,680
YOU ARE SPEAKING A LIE, AND NOT

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,314
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

61
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:15,517
WHAT I SAID WAS WHAT I READ IN

62
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:16,351
"THE WASHINGTON POST" WHICH IS

63
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,720
SELF IDENTIFIED MEMBERS ARE

64
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,655
DESTROYING THE SCHOOL.

65
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,223
I BET YOU NEVER SEND YOUR KIDS

66
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:21,824
TO THAT SCHOOL.

67
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,258
BUT YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH

68
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:25,127
THOSE PEOPLE BEING IN THIS

69
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:27,863
COUNTRY BECAUSE IT FITS IN THAT

70
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:30,065
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT YOU APPROVE OF.

71
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:32,868
THE TRUTH IS, IT'S A DISASTER.

72
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:35,270
>> IF YOU ARE AND MS-13 GANG

73
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,439
MEMBER AND YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED,

74
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,841
YOU SHOULD BE DEPORTED.

75
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:40,876
>> Tucker: THEN WHY HAVE YOU

76
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:43,445
CONSISTENTLY ATTACKED ANYBODY --

77
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:45,114
YEAH RIGHT, NOBODY HAS SAID THAT

78
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:47,015
THE MAJORITY OF IMMIGRANTS ARE

79
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,684
CRIMINALS OR BAD, I DON'T SAY

80
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:50,819
THAT AND I DON'T THINK IT.

81
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,856
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT.

82
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,257
>> Tucker: HE HAS NOT SAID

83
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:55,657
THAT.

84
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,726
YOU ARE LYING FOR POLITICAL GAIN

85
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:58,660
AS ALWAYS.

86
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,129
WHAT I HAVE SAID IS THAT WE

87
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,463
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

88
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:02,664
PEOPLE COMING IN.

89
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,299
THERE ARE 20 MILLION OF THEM

90
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,868
LIVING HERE, WE DON'T KNOW THE

91
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:08,370
BACKGROUND, AND SOME OF THEM ARE

92
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,271
BAD PEOPLE.

93
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,073
>> WOULD PASS COMPREHENSIVE

94
00:03:11,073 --> 00:03:12,508
IMMIGRATION REFORM, WE LEGALIZE

95
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,308
IT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AND IT

96
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:16,311
WILL BE A WHOLE LOT EASIER,

97
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:18,147
TUCKER, TO LOOK FOR THE REAL

98
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:19,848
CRIMINALS AFTER WE LEGALIZE THE

99
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:24,453
GOOD ONES, DON'T YOU THINK SO?

100
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,321
>> Tucker: IT'S HILARIOUS THAT

101
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,289
THAT SOLUTION COMPORTS EXACTLY

102
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:30,225
YOUR POLITICAL GOAL.

103
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:32,728
>> GIVE ME A BREAK.

104
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:35,264
>> Tucker: YOU TELL ME

105
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:37,065
RATIONALLY, HOW, IF ILLEGAL

106
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,467
IMMIGRATION, THE INABILITY OF

107
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:39,668
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO SHOW WHO

108
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,471
IS LIVING WITHIN ITS BORDERS IS

109
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,039
THE PROBLEM, HOW ENCOURAGING

110
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,075
MORE OF IT WHICH IS WHAT AMNESTY

111
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:49,077
WOULD DO IS THE SOLUTION?

112
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:51,513
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY ARE

113
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:52,414
INTERESTED IN SOLVING.

114
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:54,650
>> SO YOUR ANSWER AND MANY

115
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,752
REPUBLICANS ANSWER IS TO DEPORT

116
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,054
THE IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY.

117
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:00,489
>> Tucker: WE ARE GUESSING AT

118
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:00,889
THAT NUMBER.

119
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,493
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S

120
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:04,893
20 MILLION.

121
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,796
>> OKAY, 20 MILLION DEPORTED.

122
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:08,764
>> Tucker: WHEN WAGE GROWTH

123
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:09,932
HAS BEEN STAGNANT AND THE COST

124
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:10,766
OF EVERYTHING IS GROWING MUCH

125
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:14,269
FASTER THAN THE WAGES, YOU NEED

126
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,038
TO STOP THE ABILITIES OF

127
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,241
EMPLOYERS TO HIRE CHEAPER PEOPLE

128
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:23,512
BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE ILLEGALLY.

129
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,815
>> WE CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP THEM

130
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:27,115
HERE.

131
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,717
>> Tucker: IF YOU TOOK THIS

132
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:32,454
SERIOUSLY, AND YOU WERE BIGGER

133
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:33,755
THAN THE POLITICAL ISSUE -- >> I

134
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:36,191
AM TELLING YOU, WE HAVE A CHOICE

135
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:36,859
TO MAKE.

136
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,261
>> Tucker: YOU KNOW NOTHING

137
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:39,628
ABOUT IT.

138
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:41,797
>> I KNOW MORE THAN YOU.

139
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,298
>> Tucker: WHY WOULD AN

140
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:45,133
EMPLOYER IN THIS COUNTRY BE

141
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,301
ALLOWED TO HIRE SOMEONE

142
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:48,670
ILLEGALLY, DEPRESSING WAGES FOR

143
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,171
AMERICAN CITIZENS?

144
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:51,673
>> YOU WANT TO FIX THAT PROBLEM?

145
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:53,876
REFORM THE SYSTEM AND LEGALIZE

146
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,776
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY

147
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:55,077
HERE.

148
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:57,512
>> Tucker: YOU COULD DO IT

149
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:57,980
TOMORROW.

150
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,282
WHY SHOULD EMPLOYERS BE ALLOWED

151
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:01,316
TO HIRE ILLEGAL ALIENS?

152
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:03,518
TELL ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE

153
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:04,519
ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

154
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,521
>> WE HAVE TWO CHOICES.

155
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,556
THE POINT OF 14 MILLION OR

156
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,358
20 MILLION OR WHATEVER THE

157
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:10,359
NUMBER OR WE LEGALIZE THEM AND

158
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,793
GET THEM INTO THE SYSTEM SO WE

159
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:14,529
CAN GET THEM OUT OF THE SHADOWS.

160
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,430
>> Tucker: I DON'T HAVE TIME

161
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,265
FOR CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE

162
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:17,566
WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

163
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,134
TALKING ABOUT AND HAVEN'T

164
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,602
THOUGHT IT THROUGH AND WANT TO

165
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:22,671
COME ON AND SPEW MORE TALKING

166
00:05:22,671 --> 00:00:00,000
POINTS AND CALL ANYONE WHO
