LET'S GO NOW TO OUR OWN

6
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:14,218
KRISTIN FISHER WHO HAS SOME MORE

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,688
DETAILS ON THE STORY.

8
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:18,589

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,658
>> WE ARE THERE.

10
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:22,126
WE GOT MORE INFORMATION FROM

00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:22,860
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THAT PRESS

12
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,228
CONFERENCE AND I JUST WANT TO

13
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:25,296
RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE

14
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,934
THEY ARE NOW CALLING IS THIS A

15
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:32,503
TARGETED ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL

16
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:33,671
GAZETTE NEWSPAPER.

17
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:34,805
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS GUNMAN

18
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:35,506
KNEW SPECIFIC EMPLOYEES OR IF

19
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:38,509
YOU JUST HAD A GRIPE WITH THE

20
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,912
NEWSPAPER ITSELF BUT WE CAN NOW

21
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:42,713
CONFIRM THAT THE ATTACK WAS

22
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,715
INTENDED TO BE ON THE CAPITAL

23
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:47,385
GAZETTE NEWSPAPER WHICH IS A

24
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:49,587
LOCAL COMMUNITY NEWSPAPER, ONE

25
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,256
OF THE OLDEST NEWSPAPERS IN THE

26
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:53,457
COUNTRY OWNED BY THE BALTIMORE

27
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:53,891
SUN.

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,873
PREPARED ATTACK.

29
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:11,809
HE CAME IN THROUGH THE BUILDING,

30
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,311
THIS BUILDING JUST BEHIND ME,

31
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:14,712
THE BROWN BRICK BUILDING JUST

32
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,584
AND A SHOTGUN, AND HE JUST WENT

33
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:21,352
THROUGH THE FIRST FLOOR NEWSROOM

34
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:22,386
OF THE CAPITAL GAZETTE AND

35
00:01:22,387 --> 00:01:25,723
PICKED OFF HIS VICTIMS ONE BY

36
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:26,691
ONE.

37
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:29,560
WE KNOW THEY ARE NOW CONFIRMING

38
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:32,196
FIVE DEAD AND TOO INJURED.

39
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:33,497
THE TWO INJURED ARE ESSENTIALLY

40
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:34,999
SUPERFICIAL INJURIES.

41
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:40,104
FROM GLASS, WHICH WAS BLASTED

42
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:41,572
OUT FROM THE SHOTGUN.

43
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:44,141
NOW THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THE

44
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:46,811
PROCESS, A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS

45
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,323
CLUES THERE.

46
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:00,191
TUCKER, THE OTHER REALLY BIZARRE

47
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:03,928
TWIST IN THIS STORY IS, ABOUT

48
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:06,297
THE SHOOTER HIMSELF, WE ARE

49
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:08,766
HEARING THAT HE MUTILATED HIS

50
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:11,302
OWN FINGERTIPS, PERHAPS IN AN

51
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,674
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT

52
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,309
MEANS OR HOW HE DID IT.

53
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,544
WAS IT A LONG TIME AGO OR

54
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:25,116
DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY HIM.

55
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:27,785
THEY HAVE HAD TO IDENTIFY HIM

56
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:28,886
USING FACIAL RECOGNITION

57
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:29,320
SOFTWARE.

58
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:34,358
HE DID NOT SHOOT AT THEM.

59
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:37,595
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE SURRENDERED

60
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:38,329
OR WHAT THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES

61
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,134
THROUGH SOME GREAT EFFORT TO

62
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,174
HIM TO BE IDENTIFIED.

63
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:50,908
AND THE BIG THING THAT EVERYONE

64
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,109
IS TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE

65
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,281
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TRAINING

66
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,983
FOR AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION

67
00:02:58,984 --> 00:02:59,517
JUST ONE WEEK AGO.

68
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:01,485
THEY HAD A DRILL TO PREPARE FOR

69
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:02,686
A SITUATION JUST LIKE THIS AND

70
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:05,823
THEY WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN 60

71
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:06,190
SECONDS.

72
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,525
THE GOVERNOR AND THE MIRRORS

73
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:10,194
THAT THEY WENT IN WITHOUT

74
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:11,695
HESITATING.

75
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:12,897
THEY EXHIBITED TREMENDOUS

76
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:13,998
COURAGE, AND WITHOUT THEM IT'S

77
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,299
ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THERE WOULD

78
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,667
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MORE LIVES

79
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,672
BUT JUST A VERY SAD TO SCENE OUT

80
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:22,740
HERE AND SOME OF THE

81
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:25,176
DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE ARE HEARING

82
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:26,477
REALLY ARE QUITE BIZARRE.

83
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:29,480
A FINAL WORD OF CAUTION, WE

84
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:31,282
SHOULD BE GETTING ANOTHER UPDATE

85
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:31,882
LATER TONIGHT BUT

86
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:32,683
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOW TELLING

87
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:34,418
US THAT WE ARE NOW MOVING FROM

88
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,888
THE ACTIVE SHOOTER AND RECOVERY

89
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:38,689
PHASE TO THE INVESTIGATIVE

90
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:38,989
PHASE.

91
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,991
THIS IS THE PHASE THAT OBVIOUSLY

92
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:42,927
TAKES THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME

93
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:44,128
AND THEY URGE THE PUBLIC AND

94
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,896
URGE THE PRESS FRANKLY TO BE

95
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:47,498
PATIENT WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE

96
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,300
THEY GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT.

97
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:51,502
WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE BIGGEST

98
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:52,503
QUESTION TONIGHT IS MOTIVE.

99
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,705
WHY DID HE DO THIS, WHY DID HE

100
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,307
HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST THE

101
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:57,208
NEWSPAPER, WAS IT SOMETHING THAT

102
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,477
WAS SAID IN THE PAPER THAT HE

103
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:00,511
DIDN'T LIKE?

104
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,484
>> Tucker: LET ME STOP YOU AND

105
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:07,885
SAY, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT

106
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:09,787
THERE IS A HISTORY OF ANIMUS OR

107
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:11,722
EVEN LEGAL ACTION BETWEEN THIS

108
00:04:11,723 --> 00:00:00,000
MAN AND THE NEWSPAPER, WE CAN'T
