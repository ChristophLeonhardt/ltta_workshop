PROPERTY HE CAN ASK, BUT HE
HASN'T ASKED YET.
>> Martha: THAT IS WHAT
HAPPENED.
IT WENT VIRAL AS I SAID.
IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET.
HERE IS BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR OF
DAILYWIRE.com.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE
SHOW.
YOU SAID THIS IS A RIDICULOUS
STUNT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> I MEAN IT'S A RIDICULOUS
STUNT IN THE SENSE IF CONGRESS
WANTS TO CHANGE THE LAW RIGHT
NOW TO ALLOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT
DETAINEES TO STAY WITH THE
CHILDREN THEY COULD DO THAT.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT MOVING
TO DO THAT.
HERE IS THE REAL ISSUE.
THE ISSUE IS UNDER AMERICAN
LAW THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF
APPEALS SAID THIS.
WHEN THEY ENTER WITH THE
CHILDREN, THE CHILDREN MUST BE
REFERRED FROM OUT OF THE
SYSTEM TO GUARDIAN FIGURE.
SO THAT MEANS THE KIDS WILL BE
BY LAW SEPARATED FROM THE
PARENTS WHEN THE ILLEGAL
PARENTS COME ACROSS THE
BORDER.
THE DEMOCRATS IS SAYING TRUMP
IS SEPARATING THEM FORCIBLY.
BUT WHAT THEY WANT LIKE TO SEE
IS A MASS ATTEMPT BY TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION NOT TO ENFORCE
THE IMMIGRATION LAWS AT ALL.
SO THE ANSWER IS INSTEAD OF
RELEASING KIDS AND THE
PARENTS, LET'S RELEASE
EVERYBODY.
KIDS, PARENTS, EVERYBODY.
IF YOU WANT TO ENFORCE THE
IMMIGRATION LAW AND YOU WANT
TO KEEP KIDS WITH THEIR
PARENTS YOU COULD MAKE A LEGAL
FIX FOR THAT.
>> IT'S A GREAT POINT.
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE
CONGRESSIONAL PROCESS AND YOU
TRY TO CHANGE THIS YOU WILL
RUN HEAD LONG IN THE ISSUE OF
THE IMMIGRATION REFORM IN THE
COUNTRY TO SAY WHY ARE WE
DOING THIS, RIGHT?
HOW IS THIS WORKING?
WHY ARE WE SEPARATING THE
CHILDREN?
WE ARE SEPARATING THE CHILDREN
BECAUSE THEY COME ACROSS AND
IN SOME CASES THEY DON'T NEIF
THE CHILDREN ARE THE CHILDREN
OF THE PARENTS OR WHETHER OR
NOT THEY ARE TRAFFICKED IN THE
COUNTRY.
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE
FAMILIES.
IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T KNOW.
THEY DON'T HAVE PAPERWORK.
IN SOME CASES THEY CAN'T
COMMUNICATE THAT PROPERLY.
SO IN SOME SITUATIONS THE KIDS
ARE IN DANGER.
AND THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE
THING TO SEE THEM IN THE
HOLDING CENTERS.
IN SOME WAYS DO YOU BELIEVE
IT'S TRUE THEY BROUGHT IT ON
THEMSELVES?
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THE KIDS
BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES.
>> Martha: I MEAN THE
FAMILIES BEING SEPARATED.
>> KNOWING WHAT THE STATUS OF
THE LAW IS.
IS THE STATUS OF THE LAW IS
WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW WHY IT
CHANGES BASED ON THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES ENFORCING
THE LAW.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE KIDS
STAY WITH THE PARENTS BUT THE
EASIEST WAY IS ALLOW THE KIDS
TO STAY WITH THE PARENTS OR
THE PARENTS NOT COMING
ILLEGALLY.
DEMOCRATS LIKE MERKLEY SAYS
THE BEST WAY TO FIX IT IS NOT
ENFORCE THE LAW.
HE IS IN FAVOR OF THE
IN FAVOR OF THE CATCH AND
RELEASE POLICIES TO ALLOW
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PARENTS TO
BE RELEASED AND THEY NEVER
SHOW UP FOR THE COURT DATE.
IF YOU ENFORCE THE IMMIGRATION
LAW UNDER THE NINTH CIRCUIT
COURT OF APPEALS RULING YOU
MUST TAKE THE KIDS AWAY FROM
PARENTS.
THAT IS NOT FAULT OF THE
CONSERVATIVES.
THAT IS THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT
ON THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF
APPEALS BELOVED BY THE
DEMOCRATS THE WORLD OVER.
>> Martha: WE TALK ABOUT THE
ISSUES OVER THE WEEKEND THE
PRESIDENT, THE ABILITY TO
PARDON YOURSELF AND ALL OF
THAT, WHETHER IT'S
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION OVERALL.
LOST IN THE SHUFFLE IS A TWEET
SAYING OH, IT'S 50 -- IT'S DAY
500 OF THE PRESIDENCY.
THAT COULD BE THE MARQUEE
MOMENT OF THE DAY.
BUT BECAUSE OF THE OTHER
TWEETS WE ARE NOT TALKING
ABOUT IT.
I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK ON
DAY 500.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE IS DOING?
>> HE HAS GOVERNED MORE
CONSERVATIVELY THAN I
IMAGINED.
HE'S THE MOST CONSERVATIVE
PRESIDENT OF MY LIFETIME.
BUT IN TERMS OF HIS RHETORIC,
IT'S WHAT IT IS.
HIS RHETORIC IS WHAT IT IS.
WE HAVE AREAS TO BE GRATEFUL
FOR POLICY.
I WISH HE WOULD KEEP RHETORIC
POLICIES TO HIMSELF.
>> Martha: THE EAGLES
DECIDED NO IT TO GO TO THE
WHITE HOUSE.
SO THE PRESIDENT SAYS HAY
DON'T LIKE MY POLICY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS A HABIT
OF SAYING YOU CAN'T QUIT, YOU
ARE FIRED.
I'M NOT SHOCKED BY THE
PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO THIS.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF THE
SPORTS TEAMS VISITING THE
WHITE HOUSE.
I SEENS LIKE CELEBRITY
CULTURE -- IT SEEMS LIKE THE
CELEBRITY CULTURE AT THE
FINEST.
I DON'T LIKE KIM KARDASHIAN OR
THE EAGLES AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
I DON'T WANT THEM JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE FAMOUS TO BE AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
THIS IS WHERE POLICY SHOULD BE
DONE.
NOT PHOTO OPS.
>> I'M TOLD THAT TRUMP
DISINVITED THEM SO MAYBE HE IS
