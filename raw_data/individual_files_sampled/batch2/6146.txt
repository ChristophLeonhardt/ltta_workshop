so keith Ellison right now leading comfortably as we do a show live in the Attorney General race in Minnesota it was an interesting decision by him to go run for that race and and part of the reason he did it is because he cares about Colonel justice reform and and that's a wonderful way to effectuate that kind of change and of course for his troubles and there's the latest numbers as you see it live it's just 3% reporting but but good reason to believe with his name recognition and how progressive he is in the state is that that that he will win that race so of course since he was running he got smeared again so what I want to talk about is the smears you don't see that never happened that's kind of a curious thing to say right so you might see stories pop up from time to time and go well okay I'm gonna judge it on its merits and that's that one and I'm gonna be fair right so I literally don't even remember the last smear against Allison I know that when he was running for DNC chair they claimed that that he liked Farrakhan when he was in college and and that he once used too many diapers as a baby and then and probably took somebody's milk when he was in third grade I don't know okay but they threw the kitchen sink at him and then then we get into a nonsense debate about does he still support Farrakhan when he denounced a long time ago etc then we earlier in the night we talked about the fake scandals around Ocasio Cortes and then Kanye in running is progressive in Hawaii running against a bunch of lobbyists one was a private prison lobbyist other ones the hotel lobbyists the others were former Republicans noce bad stories about them Kanye Lange when he was 22 years old and running for office first time apparently put money in a wrong bank account and then fixed it once I think three hours later and another time I think three days later so not three days after he got caught no three days later back then when he was 22 and they're like corruption and then you talk about what is Kanye incorrupt well then he's screwed already but you manufacture that out of an unbelievably miniscule issue which he immediately corrected and and so and I can go on and on and there's been so many Randi Brice now how many controversies surrounding him in Wisconsin that we started talking about earlier tonight because he's up for election tonight as well what I want you to know whatever you see those stories is what are the other candidates who are never investigated why did the who ever investigated Kanye Lange in Hawaii as an example why do they choose not to investigate edie case and and all the other guys in the race or did day could the Hawaiian press say no no really I mean we went dug and dug against all of them and this is the only thing we found there is no way that's true instead what happens and it's normal in politics is opposition research and then you plant it with a journalist or you give it to journalist however you want to frame it right and I would hope that the journalists would say where they got the story from but they almost never say that and I I would hope that they would give you context now we were given this story we were not given the stories about any of the other people running but they never said I mean I I disagree that they never say it frequently they say where it came from but if it's true there's still run the story and I don't think that really matters well in the context of how you're how the story would get played and then get repeated and amplified when it's initially run and some paper then it's out whether the so this is a unfortunately an institutional disadvantage for progressives and then an issue for the media that I'm not sure they're even aware of so it's an institutional disadvantage because Republicans don't mind running smear jobs at all part that's I mean that's what they've done my whole life and running campaigns and I knew that even back when I was a Republican right and the Democratic establishment apparently rather enjoys it and they've gotten in primary after primary the one they ran against Laura Moser Texas was my favorite she once said something bad about another part of Texas not her district and a part of Texas that her parents are from that's the best you could find but then we were having a debate as to whether Laura Moser hates Texas or not now about what progressives don't do is smear other people because they're generally decent people at plus they don't have the budget okay keep it a rule I think that's you know most of the the smearing comes from where the money is you know that's that's how you know that all cost money the notion that Republican candidates don't get smeared or caught by journalists that obviously we know is no no that in the end and by the way the Democratic establishment also does that from time to time against Republicans well thank God for that okay so I I get it but and in big races look so let's take Roy Moore as an example because they clearly found opposition research on Roy Moore I said that during the coverage of it I gave you the proper context but you think Republicans weren't looking for stuff on Doug Jones all they were looking apparently they didn't find anything so it's smaller races that's where you get the bigger disparity nobody's paying attention to what's happening in one of the districts in Hawaii right so that's where the money guys are gonna go into Oppo research on a progressive and burry them and so I think it's a fair criticism of the media to say that you should have to be really really clear about clarifying where the research came from and how you didn't do it to the other candidates yeah we do a good journal some results okay just yeah a good journalist will not just reflect that in the story but will take that into account in pursuing story like yeah that's the information and then you so again we don't know sometimes I'm sure I hopefully sometimes it doesn't work like you plan it and they're like hmm no yeah you you know you're not you're not obviously a smart journalist wonders am i being used to suit someone else's political purpose I feel like that's old-school and I am sure that some people still do that but I feel like in this day and age like I got to get the clicks I got to get the headlines I got I got to build my brand you got a story I'm running it right away right that's my sense of just how things are going maybe the desire to win and be first was always there I mean it was sure sure yeah that's certainly true so the last thing on that is me are you telling me that whoever Laura Moser is opponent was who eventually won but I don't remember their name that that person never said anything bad that there's not a single bad quote they've ever said of course there was and of course if you had spent the money and you dug and dug and you could find quotes that they said about Texas or that district or something else and go home can you imagine what they said and then we'd be having that debate I I lived in Texas for more than five years I can say that in my experience a lot of the parts of Texas don't like other parts of Texas it's a big state there's a big differences between them
