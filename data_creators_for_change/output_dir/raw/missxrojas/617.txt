1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,630
alright so I change the volume of input

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,399
on my microphone and hopefully this will

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,750
actually work now which hasn't been

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing for a while but either way itself</font>

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,349
to hold webcam<font color="#E5E5E5"> because going to fall off</font>

6
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:14,410
and that will look very attractive at

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,039
all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably deletes it the other</font>

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,650
like seven videos that I've tried record

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,869
on this quick capture think what you

10
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:24,789
know saves a lot of effort but it's

11
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:28,720
really not that fantastic um but yeah

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,119
new harry potter title I'm sorry it

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,830
seemed to take that to hold of a phantom

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,630
by storm will that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like really</font>

15
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird feelings about like like Amazon</font>

16
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,580
people like how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> how did they don't</font>

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,230
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the pre-orders today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,420
typical for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and or did they</font>

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,480
just assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because Jake of rotting</font>

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,440

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,730
