remember George secure elomar the professor who tweeted all I want for Christmas is white genocide while he made a return to Twitter prominence last week celebrating the stabbing of right-wing Brazilian presidential candidate Jer balsan ro who's been called the Trump of Brazil you have to wonder if comments like these are why Georgie doesn't seem to have a job anymore let's take a look so in one of the few instances of Twitter holding the far left to account former Drexel University professor George SiC Arel Omar got suspended on Twitter last week after saying I was having a good day and then fascists Jo Valle scenario got stabbed so now I'm having a great day it seems like Twitter suspended the former professor for 12 hours or fewer for glorifying violence we prohibit content that condones or celebrates acts of violence that could promote imitation of the act now George like every Marxist weasel typically speaks in long-winded sentences with terms like patriarchy heteronormativity etc which while meaningless are words big enough to obfuscate the fact that he doesn't know what the heck he's talking about but George's Twitter account is more to the point as are his responses to Michael requests for comment lol fuck the Daily Caller and when I reached out for this story a straight into the point-three middle finger emojis George first came into the spotlight two years ago when he said all I want for Christmas is white genocide which apparently was supposed to mock people who believed in white genocide but he was still teaching at Drexel when after the Las Vegas massacre last year he said white people and men are told that they are entitled to everything this is what happens when they don't get what they want after that remark and similar ones George got placed on administrative leave for his own safety and the campus's according to Drexel and he resigned a few months later to take up a visiting scholar position at New York University but nothing gold can stay the self-professed communist is apparently no longer there either now it could have been because visiting scholar positions typically don't last too long but it could also have been because NYU got sick of stuff like tweet in which the esteemed academic draws a genius comparison between the national anthem and the Nazi salute or how about this flattering take on a little kid beating a pinata of a nice officer don't recall there being a Twitter suspension for that one but good on Twitter for taking action this time I guess personally I'd rather have as few restrictions on speech as possible but if the left is playing dirty in the culture war by stoking outrage to silence dissent it might be time to fight fire with fire for campus unmasked I'm Rob trim shock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm
