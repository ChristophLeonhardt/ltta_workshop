joining me now are two governors Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio and independent governor Bill Walker of Alaska you guys are in town for the NGA so thanks for coming in another governor today the governor florida rick scott set out a potential gun control proposal compromise and it includes having a way for people to file a temporary restraining order and have that in a background check to prevent a gun sale if there's a mental health issue raising long arms to 21 years old a ban on bunks bump stocks an idea of putting essentially one police officer per a thousand students at every school a few other ideas I'm just curious Governor Kasich I'll start with you what kind of model do you think that is for states going forward it it seems as if for somebody who's been accused of being in the pocket of the NRA this seemed to be somewhat of a compromise well look I haven't studied that in-depth you know when it comes to the restraining order see I think it needs to go farther than that if you have somebody in your home the family member knows is not stable could hurt themselves hurt family members or hurt somebody outside of the home I believe there needs to be a restraining order and they those guns should be taken from them right okay I think that is where we need to go but that's a step forward of course we should ban the bump stocks it should have been done long time ago that's like to me now can we get it done in Florida cuida get done in Ohio you have to be seen but look it's this is all moving in a direction where we want to have respect for the Second Amendment but yet have reasonable reasonable restrictions for example Chuck one of the things that I'm always concerned about is is these high these these high-capacity magazines you know that the problem with assault weapons is you got one that's an ar-15 but you have another one that's a deer rifle you know hunting rifle so how do you get at it I think you get at it through the ammunition or is is the system gonna move far enough to accommodate that I don't know but here's what I do think I think the Nick system where everybody has to report so we know I believe that will be enhanced do I think this restraining order type thing can pass I do but look you would put that in the system as well well that way if somebody sees something they report something action can be taken so if you see somebody who's unstable in your home or for example if you're outside the home and you see somebody unstable you have to have a way in which to contact law enforcement we're working on that but I don't the key is we have these issues in my state and Florida any of these states can we pass something right now we're getting closer to that but we have to be able to get some change going in a real way Governor Walker you represent a rural state guns are essentially seen differently in a rural state than they are in an urban state is there much you think Alaska needs to do and when it comes to school safety what do you guys think well there is and you're right Chuck a lot of Alaska is unique you know with we use gun for for hunting for subsistence for a way of life for protection one route in the in the wilds and call the last frontier forever easy it is it is call for a reason but so I mean our focus is is going to be it certainly is going to be on keeping our children safe and and that's going to be important I I think there's some things that that we can do one thing I like about the NGA is that listen to other governor talk about what they're doing we've already put together or some efforts with our Public Safety and Commissioner of Education making the school safer I'd like very much the reporting opportunity to make sure there's a hotline and some of Collins about raising the age that's a possibility that some of you gets more presidents talking about it a lot of young people in in Alaska that hunted a very young age right so on subsistence they'll go out and there'll be the hunters for their for their community and they'll bring in you know food so that's gonna be you know you know what I every state is very very unique and I think I watched today governor Scott I really empathize and and you know with him every state need to do with what works best for their state all right Governor Kasich you've moved on this your record indicates somebody would say you're a pretty pro-gun guy NRA would look at your record on one hand but you've moved on this what's moved you well Chuck I voted for the assault weapons ban in 1994 when I ran for governor in 2010 I didn't have any support from the NRA okay behind a bunch of base in a second and if I think it's gonna endanger the public I'm not gonna sign it for example there's talk now in my state about changing stand-your-ground I said I'm not signing it don't give it to me so what happened Chuck though no matter where you were in the past whether it's Governor Walker whether it's Rick Scott doesn't look at what's happened in this country I formed this little group you know to talk about what we can do a couple months ago I mean I don't remember exactly when because I said the public is demanding something you've got to let some air out of the pressure cooker so it's a matter of now for anybody is to take a look at the tragedy involving these children in Las Vegas and say something has to be done what's important Chuck is that those that love the Second Amendment this is not an attempt to go and come in your house and take your guns or it's not what this is about this is about reasonable restrictions to have gun safety our community safer most people know that nobody is interested in taking away guns the governor Walker there is an argue the NRA does use it as a tactic maybe it's to fundraise maybe it's to Rauh people up but it has warped the debate you know could could they be better actors here the NRA and how they how they proceed with this debate well and again what we do in Alaska is so different so they're there the arguments that maybe are raised pro and con other other states really are sometimes someone lost on the Alaskan lifestyle so it really is a matter of making sure that were not it's not accessible to come into our schools and and and our children do not become victims we had a situation in the past in Alaska that was it was horrific and we don't want to have another I want to ask about the idea of arming teachers where are you honest Chuck I think if something there's some teachers there's an Ohio Building they're infecting Ohio right about that there a lot of school districts are doing this they don't tell the parents I think a lot of parents are finding out today going oh really well there are guns in these schools and these safes what what I would say is under a program where teachers would volunteer you don't have to pay him a bonus these are people that love our kids they put their bodies in front of the bullets to save our kids you think a financial incentive is actually a warped thing to do no I mean warp that's it I mean what I say is you don't even have to do that because there are going to be teachers who are going to say I want to sign up I want to get extensive training I want to know what to do and if that's the case then I'm poor that what do you say to the parents that are gonna be like whoa whoa whoa well you know maybe maybe they ought to know that there are teachers in the school who have been trained and they have guns I think in that case if parents knew exactly you know what was going on and therefore protecting their kids then I guess the question I have is why go there immediately when we haven't tried the middle step which is for instance with governor Scott's proposing Governor Walker which is one police officer per thousand students at a school which seems fairly reasonable you know for me it's access it was amazing for me and how far we've moved because when I went to grew up and girl last week we take our gun to school because we should term again during the during the school breaks we'd sit there in class and look out not all the time this is a different life get out there and during the break you grab your shotgun and go out get some time again you couldn't bring the liquid be having a gun in but different conversation I'm done to be all probably but but so we have we have moved a long ways but my concern is just you know our schools are designed to have free access everybody come to the school everybody can walk into various doors and we need to change that so coming into the school itself is more challenging after school starts so I think that there's some things we can do on that that are critical look we've hardened we spent a lot of money hardening schools and getting into a position of where they know what they know what to do if there is an incident but when you say is our middle steps is you know Chuck I have been at times very critical administration the president at this point if he falls through deserves a lot of praise because he is providing leadership here and I think he's making it easier for the states politically to get something done so in this one he deserves credit all right and when asked you guys are putting together a health care trying to a health care proposal that would try to cross party lines a little bit I saw that the other governor Walker from Wisconsin he is proposing it's interesting I think he's borrowing one of the ideas that have come through from another state which is ways to try to fix the system to lower cost which is includes maybe having the state pick up the cost of insurance for the the highest price patients is that part of this point what we did we did that yeah we actually were the first state that did that and so that was the the we insurance plan we Legislature passed it on a bipartisan basis almost and this has worked this really hasn't cost we're there very well and so so we've already done that other states are looking and doing that as well so that makes that that makes an abundance of sense to do that you know for us it's it's a matter of making sure that we have options that we really bring down the cost of health care we have the highest cost of health care in the nation partly because the nature of our state that we're so spread out 82% of our community do not have roads to them so you have to fly everywhere or go by boat you got to financially incentivize doctors to come well sometimes you do yeah you do you have to do that and so we have to compete with other location but but the cost is just it's just and it's just out of control so we want to we want to bring down the cost but make sure that we still have the based upon value not initially on services provider on a fee basis but on value so so it's it's a it's a process that we looked at closely during this the whole debate at last fall and if there's more we can do on that come on are you concerned that the Trump administration wants Obamacare to work or not well if you're not going to fund the those CSRs and that's that subsidies for the health plans you're going to continue to create tremendous turbulence in the individual market and make it harder for people to have insurance I don't like what they're doing in that that's one of the messages that I had today that Congress you know this is this whole thing of Alexander Murray senator from Tennessee Republican Murray from a Washington have a plan to sort of step this step about this damper thing Chuck there's well they have one had a vote on it okay not ask the president permission you know we don't like mom or dad can I go to the dance just go do something okay secondly I believe there should be flexibility in Obamacare with the essential health benefits and flexibility and Medicaid I believe that in Medicaid we could save hundreds of billions maybe approaching a trillion dollars if we do Medicaid reforms that don't affect the person that needs it and finally meaning you don't believe in work requirement in other wormans fine for those that are really able body because you don't want people to pay the bill you know paying all the bills and somebody else who's able body doesn't do anything but at the end Chuck you really fix healthcare are big companies I'm going as fast as I can big companies have to demand from the insurance companies you get me high quality at lower prices and if you can't do it we're gonna find out another company that will do it we're and that is what's going to lead to paying people for performance and bonuses for those that do a great job I can't this is so important and so frankly it's not easy to do but it needs to be done by our companies Governor Walker what have you told him about the upside of being a political independent well you you can play on all teams you can put a cabinet together this is made up of Republicans and Democrats and independents and the cabinet looks like Alaskans which it is so I it's it's an advantage certainly advantage here in Washington no question about that I think there's as you know governing that way well a lot of rumors today today in some of my favorite morning newsletters talking about John Kasich running for president as an independent have you asked him for advice on how to do it well I didn't even read the article could you send it to me if I could see look the party is my vehicle and not my master and I don't know what I'm gonna be doing Chuck and we have to see what happens but here's the thing I believe with Millennials and the Gen Xers they've had it with both parties they've had it I believe we will see a time in the future where we will probably have a multi-party make up in this country because neither party is really responding and these young people look it's a new era of activism and citizenship in this country and if the parties can't respond you know is I never refer to you as a small our Republican and basically that's where you lean but you may be in a political novel if you run for office I'm in a tug of war I'm for trade I'm for immigration I'm concerned about that that's where my party lives that's our DNA and somehow we've moved off of that and when when you don't pay attention to your doing DNA you can get sick simply put I don't believe any one party has a monopoly on good ideas and when you can't reach over to the other other group and you can do to sort of put something together you miss out on I mean use any analogy sports analogy business analogy if Board of Directors divided themselves up if a team divided themselves up that way it would never work so I know here think I know your Alaska state director is I learned about Alaska hanging out with this guy in the last day that I've learned in all of my lifetime all right governors Kasich and Walker good to see you thanks for having it yes enjoy thank you the wet wet
