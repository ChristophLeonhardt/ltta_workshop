1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,239
you've been talking a very vocal<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:06,149
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stimulated stimulated growth</font>

3
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:08,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and how they've been pushing</font>

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,590
growth at any cost where do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's left the Chinese economy I think</font>

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,410
China is kind of the mother of all black

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,050
swans in a sense it's you know when it's

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,910
when something if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Chinese growth</font>

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,859
slows down and I've actually declines

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,679
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see first significant</font>

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,869
problems in China right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you say you</font>

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,869
say black black swan that usually you

13
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,680
know that refers to the telly book and

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,050
about an unexpected event if we're

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,610
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all the time is it</font>

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,580
really that unexpected well the I think

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,310
China suffers from the false axiom<font color="#CCCCCC"> okks</font>

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">accident yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fourth</font>

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,910
outcome is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> limiting example would</font>

20
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,160
happen tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure for 50 years the</font>

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,260
axiom is basically something that you

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,180
think it's self-evident and doesn't need

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,010
to be proven right okay so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United</font>

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">States for 50 years housing prices never</font>

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,690
declined nationwide right okay at once

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,390
so a lot of decision makers including

27
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">Federal Reserve basically as New York</font>

28
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,170
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ax film in their assumptions</font>

29
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,960
right and but when but it's it's not a

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,909
law it just it's an observation yeah

31
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,439
it's something was you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,259
based on generation so when they so it

33
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,479
builds on itself it was a lot it created

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,280
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more Aboriginal system right we</font>

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,380
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the banking executives say</font>

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,880
well we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they came</font>

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,439
before Congress said we never really

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,810
calculated informational housing decline

39
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,600
in our when we did our model exactly so

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,219
too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with was a Black Swamp</font>

41
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,340
right not to all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> China is kind</font>

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,170
of the same you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the false</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Axum in</font>

43
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,999
China is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> economy of you always</font>

44
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,340
be growing okay and the reason for that

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,649
because their economy has grown the last

46
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">three years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years a</font>

47
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,310
have it hasn't had any cyclic ality

48
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,009
right so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national assumption is it</font>

49
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,270
is going to be growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line will</font>

50
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,329
keep going out the way it has you've

51
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,520
talked about how there's basically been

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,670
three periods to the Chinese over

53
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,729
investment so far what are those so the

54
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,359
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> recover from the period in 1998</font>

55
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,459
because a decade of ten percent growth

56
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,229
real growth and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that that was</font>

57
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,480
real growth when I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the real</font>

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,250
means before<font color="#E5E5E5"> inflation I mean after</font>

59
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">after inflation that's what I mean the</font>

60
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,239
real is not now that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> authentic</font>

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,159
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this way yeah so you know</font>

62
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,480
there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of growth</font>

63
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,730
demoscene growth a year and the problem

64
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">is when economy of that size is growing</font>

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,099
at such a high rate you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of a</font>

66
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,989
lot of the government plays a very large

67
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,569
role in the economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quality of the</font>

68
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,400
growth that very late stages comes

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,510
fairly weak right or low the cunha so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

70
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,849
usually try to try to use example

71
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,590
starbucks because people can relate to

72
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,019
it that's you know in 1887 starbucks was

73
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,459
closed and open that not one point five

74
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,250
stores a day right in 2007's is open

75
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,079
five stores a day so when you open that

76
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,790
winning stores a day the quality of your

77
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,230
decisions are going to be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

78
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,879
the corrupting one around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner</font>

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other exactly so in China you</font>

80
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,760
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we could see the some little</font>

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,739
of because he's some evidence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

82
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,989
how poor the quality was when they build

83
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,510
a city orders in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right Mr Gold</font>

84
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,519
Mongolia for 1 million people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,340
empty right we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video at one</font>

86
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,459
point showing the empty city so they the

87
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision-making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a sense is it the</font>

88
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,989
opportunities for genuine growth sort of

89
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,910
you know start to get thinner and

90
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,680
thinner so<font color="#CCCCCC"> too in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep up the</font>

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,959
growth they they start making<font color="#CCCCCC"> these kind</font>

92
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,569
of errors let's write or the South China

93
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,970
mold which is a you know the second

94
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,349
biggest mall in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world that is</font>

95
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,790
completely empty and it's only second

96
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,410
biggest because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> dubai mall is</font>

97
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,540
largest right but not not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

98
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,880
comparison this<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this fight so the</font>

99
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,650
sense of the point is the the quality

100
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,389
the quality of the growth was not the

101
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,160
late stages was not very good right and

102
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,079
then so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the first period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we</font>

103
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,910
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crisis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i call this stage</font>

104
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because during the crisis</font>

105
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,829
you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> chinese economy its</font>

106
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,049
growth slowed down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to from ten percent</font>

107
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,910
to eight or six percent but it was still

108
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing and this is the economy that is</font>

109
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,169
an export nation right export was down

110
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,940
we're down twenty five percent the

111
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,590
tonnage of booths transport was down

112
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,620
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this didn't affect the overall</font>

113
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,709
growth numbers well they know they know

114
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,359
well that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so the dick</font>

115
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,160
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but you have some statistics</font>

116
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,560
that basically disagree is the official

117
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,820
numbers because they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twista</font>

118
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,130
consumption was actually declined for

119
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,380
them for the first time in decades

120
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,910
okay so you start in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you so you</font>

121
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,020
start seeing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

122
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,850
officially work<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they making</font>

123
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,910
those numbers if the other signs of

124
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,100
economic growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't there exactly so</font>

125
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,530
this is the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sensors you</font>

126
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,660
know you know the media this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

127
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country that sends people to ji for</font>

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
writing articles they don't like so this

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the country they can fight the</font>

130
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,830
numbers as well right so that the third

131
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,960
stage and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> K this is kind of the</font>

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of crisis today and basically this</font>

133
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,720
is the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is afraid what if</font>

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">what will happen to its MP no to its</font>

135
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,320
political stability if it has high

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,030
unemployment right because it has no so

137
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,730
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little social social safety net the</font>

138
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,560
hungry people they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't complain they</font>

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,900
riot<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what happened since</font>

140
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,570
then they had what they had a stimulus

141
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,610
package which accounted for fourteen

142
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,950
percent of GDP and it was injected into

143
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the economy through fire hose right</font>

144
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,390
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese kind of unique in this</font>

145
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,400
sense that we had a large tables as well

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,160
but our government has a control of a

147
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,570
small portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the economy right they</font>

148
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">can create a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money and throw it</font>

149
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,960
into the economy but they can't force

150
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,850
bank filling the land and they can't

151
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,680
force corporations need to borrow and

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,660
spend the money yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess well this</font>

153
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,390
dish that's right so in China that

154
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,890
government you know the controls the

155
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">banks so you can force them to land and</font>

156
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,700
it's a third of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country's you know</font>

157
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,320
is basically state-owned enterprises

158
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,110
that it can force to spend right right

159
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,960
and therefore the smile the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourteen</font>

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of gdp was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thrown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

161
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,890
the economy at very high pace just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

162
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,780
keep the economy going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now you have</font>

163
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,420
incredible<font color="#E5E5E5"> excesses where do you what do</font>

164
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see happens next is China you know</font>

165
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,700
is it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's are the problems that</font>

166
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,680
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face a year out two</font>

167
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,200
years ten years when what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens to X</font>

168
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,610
attention it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to figure</font>

169
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,080
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going to trigger right</font>

170
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,510
promise but one of the triggers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

171
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,300
think of is that the slow growth or god

172
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,280
forbid decline right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because</font>

173
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,900
remember this is the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> accident the</font>

174
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">false accident there the scanning</font>

175
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,320
that'll be growing be best yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

176
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,970
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> economy where you</font>

177
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,880
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-percent vacancy in a</font>

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,980
skyscrapers but they still be the most

179
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,530
building more skyscrapers because the

180
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,790
ration always it's always going to be

181
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,470
growing unlike a place like New York

182
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,409
where we have

183
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,089
pretty high vacancy rate now in

184
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:39,639
Manhattan but you don't see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

185
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,739
cranes exactly sky square exactly so

186
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,689
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the huge difference so if the</font>

187
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:46,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">gross slows down declines it's a I</font>

188
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,729
compared to there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a movie speed with</font>

189
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,199
Keanu Reeves<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and there was a</font>

190
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,969
bus and there is a bus that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's near</font>

191
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> girls if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says if the speed drops</font>

192
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,889
below 50 it blows up it's kinda like

193
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,599
China because this is this in the

194
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,269
economy that has a very hyper a tional

195
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:02,769
leverage right hi financial leverage

196
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,659
because the operation which comes from

197
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:07,509
manufacturing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if the gdp</font>

198
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,099
growth slows down starring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

199
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,169
profitability disappears and suddenly

200
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,699
started bleeding money very fast and

201
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,499
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very deflationary so they</font>

202
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,179
have to hope that they have a can of

203
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,769
ribs you can somehow get under the bus

204
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,289
and stop it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you know let it slow</font>

205
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,269
down a bit before it completely exists

206
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:23,589
right in the remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter we did not</font>

207
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,869
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play and speak to so is that</font>

208
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:28,119
available so China speed three might be

209
00:07:28,119 --> 00:00:00,000
a lead to disaster that's right
