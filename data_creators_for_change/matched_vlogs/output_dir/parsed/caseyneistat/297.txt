last day in Sydney leaving this
afternoon I have a semi exciting morning
planned you know to miss this place
mostly I'm going to miss this breakfast
and the scenery and loving to miss this
place I'm only here for a couple of days
the reason why I came over is just for
like a one hour commitment but to make a
trip like you know worth it for me
YouTube organised all these great events
I missed all of them because I miss my
flight and was stuck in Dubai
today they organized something kind of
special for me hello
yeah supposed to be on a seaplane but
I'm here in the office and there doesn't
seem to be anybody oh here it comes
I'm Casey ready

look around thank you

experience thanks again this is fun
thanks a long
thank you for everything rather than
just going back to the hotel I had
Richard in the Tesla dump me here
somewhere in town with the boosted board
I got a I got to get a little bit more
Sydney in before I go I just seen you
compassionate reporters like I recognize
that thing he didn't me then I've been
on a bit of the chair to get new
sneakers I met a guy at a different
speaker store and he sent me down this
alleyway garbage fancy store
this is a crazy store that's too weird
today you have some really weird kids
these are like the weirdest things I've
ever seen these big sellers girls lovely
to meet you goodbye see you later I
didn't get any shoes because they were
too weird but that store and those girls
were awesome
found my way down to this park it's like
on the other side of where the city
where I run to the other side it takes
like three days to adjust the jetlag it
takes like three days to like get over
all the stress of problem you're excited
this is my third day that I'm I'm like
most excited to be here it's also the
day that I'm leaving
thanks Mike thank you very much
solid lunch happy I gotta head back to
hotel now these are packing doing the
not fun stuff what do we have here
dear Casey dear Casey we hope you had a
wonderful time at brandcast we couldn't
let you leave without an iconic
Australian gift from the
Intercontinental architect classic
tom-toms it's been a pleasure Nicole and
the team
dear Nicole and the team at the
Intercontinental Sydney I have had a
lovely stay in thank you cheese basket
with slippers and Vegemite pajamas for
the airplane event in my eye mask for
the airplane and a baby koala bear and
another jar of and all this other stuff
you Australian sure to know how to make
a guy feel special
I really can't feel bad about spending
just a little bit of my afternoon
napping being on a plane for two days
straight without having a proper bed to
lay down and it's punishing so just I'm
just taking a little bit of advantage of
this opportunity
I've got an hour left before I leave
this hotel room considering it looks
like somebody tried to rob the place I
should probably spend this time packing
but again I gotta sit on a plane I'm
getting a I'm getting a run in Sydney
you will be missed hotel to go the
airport I think that this has to be my
turnaround point
well it was a good run I'm glad I got it
in now I have exactly 12 minutes before
a car picks me up downstairs and somehow
I gotta pack up all this mess
thank you so much
Emirates was giving you a really hard
time about the boosted board they
wouldn't let me check it and they said
Security's gonna take it from me so
that's my skateboard yeah
no problem
he's getting a supervisor this is it
they're gonna take it
you can take anything that is both in
Kentucky
there's nothing else I can do
I would just make me sad Australia what
the I travel around the world I think
every single month if the policy is no
boosted words I understand
then no boosted words if the policy is
boosted words are great I prefer that
but you can't have this ill-defined
malleable flexible otherwise it just
doesn't seem fair like the burden of
information it shouldn't fall on us like
get your head together I mean I'm not
mad I'm just
know what I'm mad DJ I got a question is
there any way I can sit on the pontoon
while we you can give it a guy you have
to hold on really tight I've got a great
grip
where
