00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
before i'm finished i guarantee you that

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,250
we will have apple products made in the

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,059
United States not in China I guarantee

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if it means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple is going to</font>

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,519
have to create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little incentive for</font>

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,470
them to stay here we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:26,430
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do that boycott Apple it's</font>

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,170
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the iphone is</font>

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,910
going to be produced<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US there's</font>

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,219
talk about increases in minimum wage and

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,110
for an able to iphone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made</font>

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,030
assembled in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US would require</font>

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,550
somewhere around one to two dollars per

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,860
hour given that<font color="#CCCCCC"> US people are not going</font>

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,239
to work for one to two dollars an hour

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,100
it's just simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,770
they're assembled in china they're made

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,390
from components some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them come from</font>

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">china most of them come from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taiwan on</font>

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,550
top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the employees and there's</font>

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a million different people who</font>

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,449
actually go and assemble these phones

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,149
can make about one to two US dollars per

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,670
hour that cost is a big advantage when

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,280
you're putting building 270 million

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
iPhones per year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font>

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,960
be possible for Apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be forced to</font>

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,030
move the labor to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font>

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,740
that they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start forcing a</font>

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,619
lot of companies to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move their labor to</font>

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,689
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US and when you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the total</font>

33
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,369
margin this would take about fifteen

34
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:21,930
percent of the profitability out of the

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,970
phone so it's unlikely that that would

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,230
happen

37
00:01:25,230 --> 00:00:00,000
