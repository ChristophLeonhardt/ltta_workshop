SINCE THE INAUGURATION DONALD TRUMP HAS FACED A COUPLE ACCUSATIONS THAT HE DOESN'T TAKE ANTI-SEMITIC THREATS SERIOUSLY. IN RESPONDING TO THAT, IT HAS LED TO STATEMENTS BY DON'T TRUMP LIKE THIS. HERE'S THE STORY, FOLKS. NUMBER ONE, I AM THE LEAST ANTI-SEMITIC PERSON YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. THAT SHOULD BE THE END OF THE DISCUSSION BUT WE WILL HAVE IT ANYWAY. NOT JUST THAT YOU KNOW, BUT THAT YOU'VE SEEN. MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW DONALD TRUMP BUT HE IS LESS ANTI-SEMITIC THAN, LIKE, NETANYAHU. WHO I'VE ALSO SEEN. ELIE WIESEL. A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR. HE ALSO KIND OF HATED JEWS. THE WHOLE HOLOCAUST HUNTER THING WAS JUST TO THROW YOU OFF. JARED AND IVANKA, MORE ANTI-SEMITIC THAN DONALD TRUMP. I'VE SEEN THEM THE REASON I HESITATED WAS I THOUGHT YOU SAID JARED NAVONKA. I'M TOO OUT OF IT, I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS JARED NAVONKA IS, I DON'T READ THE PAPER ENOUGH HERE IS WHY WE ARE RETURNING TO THIS, BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN HE IS OPENING HIMSELF UP TO THE SORTS OF ACCUSATIONS. FOR MORE THAN A DECADE THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD AN OFFICE THAT INVESTIGATES ANTI-SEMITIC THREATS AND ADVOCATES FOR ACTION TO COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM THAT WAS GREAT, WHEN THEY HAD THOSE STAFFERS. BUT JULY 1 WAS THE DATE. WHICH MEANS THAT THIS OFFICE WHICH HAS FUNCTIONS FOR 13 YEARS, AND I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY DOESN'T TAKE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET, WON'T HAVE A STAFF AS OF JULY 1. WHY IS THAT? WELL, AT LEAST WHY THEY ARE SAYING IT IS AND THAT THEY SIMPLY PROVIDED AN EXCUSE FOR OTHERS IN GOVERNMENT NOT TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE THAT THE SPECIAL ENVOY DEALT WITH. DISAGREEING WITH TILLERSON SPECIFICALLY THE ADL CEO SAID NOT CRITICAL, THOUGH, TO REX TILLERSON OR DONALD TRUMP. WHAT DO JEWISH GROUPS KNOW ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM? ARE YOU TELLING ME THERE ISN'T SOME GOLDMAN SACHS EXECUTIVE WHO WOULDN'T WANT THIS JOB, TRAVELING AROUND AND TALKING ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM? I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS AN ANTI-SEMITE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THE ISSUE IS, HAS DONALD TRUMP WINKED, NODDED, AND GIVEN THUMBS-UP TO SERIOUS ANTI-SEMITES IN THIS COUNTRY? THE ANSWER, OBVIOUSLY, IS YES. THEN WE HAVE TO DO THIS STORY ABOUT HOW HE'S GETTING RID OF THIS JOB THAT NO ONE KNEW EXISTED, BUT THOSE GROUPS KNEW, AND THE JOB PROBABLY DID SOME GOOD. BUT THEY DON'T CARE. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT INTERESTED IN FIGHTING ANTI-SEMITISM, HE DOESN'T CARE. HE CAN'T OPEN UP A GOLF COURSE ON ANTI-SEMITISM. HE'S INTERESTED IN THINGS THAT WILL ENRICH DONALD TRUMP. EVERYTHING HE DOES IS IN SERVICE OF THAT. NOT LITERALLY EVERYTHING, I GET IT, BUT ALMOST LITERALLY EVERYTHING. IT STANDS TO REASON WHAT BEN IS SAYING, THAT THIS RHETORIC THIS TOXIC RHETORIC, LITTLE BY LITTLE, IT CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE HATE. SO THAT WINK WINK THAT BEN IS TALKING ABOUT I THINK AS PART OF AN OVERALL WINK WINK, WHICH IS HATE SPEECH. AND IT INCREASES THE POSSIBILITY OF US SEEING MORE INCIDENTS WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ANTI-SEMITISM OR HATRED OR ANY KIND THAT CAN TURN VIOLENT. HE SPEAKING TO PEOPLE ON THE ALT-RIGHT AND ANGRY, DISAFFECTED PEOPLE, AND YES, SOME OF THEM WILL BE ON THE LEFT. I'M SURE IF YOU TOOK A POLL WE KNOW WHERE MOST OF THEM ARE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT DEBATE WITH TOMI LAHREN OR ANYONE ELSE, WE GOT IT, THERE ARE SOME LOONS ON THE LEFT. THERE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. A CRAZED ANARCHIST TOOK A SHOT AT WILLIAM MCKINLEY, UNLESS IT WAS JAMES GARFIELD, BUT I THINK IT WAS A CRAZED ANARCHIST. HE WAS A LEFTIST. CAN WE GO ONE SHOW WITHOUT BRINGING UP WILLIAM MCKINLEY'S ASSASSINATION? IT'S LIKE YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN ASSASSINATIONS, THE MUSICAL. AND I THINK THE MURDERER OF JAMES GARFIELD WAS A DISGRUNTLED OFFICE SEEKER. THE STORY, IT'S THREE POSITIONS IN GOVERNMENT, JUST GIVE THE JOBS TO FRIENDS OF YOURS. FILL IT WITH A COUPLE OF THE SHITTY SONS OF BUSINESSMEN YOU WORK WITH. THAT'S WHAT I SAID GOLDMAN SACHS. JUST PRETENDS YOU CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. GOLDMAN SACHS PROBABLY HAS SOME JEWS. THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE OVER THESE POSITIONS WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ISSUE, THAT'S WHY HE SENT KUSHNER AND GREENBLATT TO NEGOTIATE MIDDLE EAST PEACE, THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IF THIS POSITION EXISTED DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, MIKE BROWN DIDN'T HAVE IT. EXACTLY. BUT THIS KIND OF ISSUE IS SMALLER, SPECIFIC, PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TIME, THEY HAVE SUCH BIG ISSUES TO TALK ABOUT, BUT IT'S THE KIND OF ISSUE WE CAN'T ALLOW TO SLIP BY. TODAY THIS HAPPENED, ALSO ANOTHER ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT WAS SET UP UNDER OBAMA TO FIGHT RIGHT-WING EXTREMISM HAS BEEN DEFUNDED. THIS IS AFTER A REPORT COMES OUT THE CONFIRMS WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW, THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF VIOLENT EXTREMISTS IN THE COUNTRY ARE RIGHT-WINGERS. THEY JUST DEFUNDED ANOTHER GROUP. IT WON'T BE FRONT PAGE NEWS BUT IT MATTERS. AND IT MATTERS TO THEM, THEY HEAR IT. WHATEVER THOSE STUPID WEBSITES ARE, DANGEROUS WEBSITES, I'M NOT JUST TRYING TO DIMINISH THEM BY SAYING THEY ARE STUPID, BUT WHAT IS IT, 4CHAN? IS THAT A THING? THE SECTIONS IN THAT THAT APPEAL TO THOSE GUYS I KNOW THE INTERNET. WHERE DO WE WORK? AMA STANDS FOR ASK ME ANYTHING, JOHN. BELIEVE ME, THE WORD GETS OUT. THAT STORY WILL GET MISSED BY MOST PEOPLE, BUT THEY DEFUNDED ANOTHER OFFICE WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO INVESTIGATE US, IS WHAT THEY WILL SAY. I KNOW ON THE RIGHT CONTINUALLY THEY LOVE TO POOH-POOH THESE CONCERNS OVER ANTI-SEMITISM, EVEN THOUGH A SYNAGOGUE WAS SHOT UP THIS YEAR, THERE WERE SO MANY BOMB THREATS MADE AGAINST THOSE COMMUNITIES, EVEN IF NOT A SINGLE BOMB GOES OFF IMAGINE WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO THOSE JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTERS MUST FEEL LIKE KNOWING THEY ARE BEING POTENTIALLY TARGETED, BUT ALSO A REPORT CAME OUT IN APRIL SHOWING THE ACTUAL ANTI-SEMITIC VIOLENCE WAS UP 40 TO 45% YEAR-OVER-YEAR. PEOPLE LOVE TO PRETEND IT'S NOT AN ISSUE BUT IT IS. AND THE DOLLARS AND CENTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT ARE SO SMALL, IT MAKES NO SENSE. TWO THINGS. ONE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE GUY WHO RAN EXXON IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WHY REX TILLERSON IS MAKING THIS DECISION HE DIDN'T WANT THE JOB, HE HAS NO PROPENSITY FOR THIS, IT'S INEXPLICABLE. WE GLOSS OVER THIS FACT BECAUSE IN THE LIST OF INCOMPETENTS FOR TRUMP, HE'S NOT ON THE TOP OF THE LIST. HE MIGHT BE A FAIRLY BRIGHT GUY, GETTING TO BE THE CEO OF EXXON MOBIL, THAT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OF THE OIL INDUSTRY IN GENERAL THAT GUY IS AN ACHIEVER. BUT IT'S INSANE THAT HE'S THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WE WILL LOOK BACK 20 YEARS FROM NOW, AND THAT WILL BE THE MOST CRAZY CABINET APPOINTMENT DONALD TRUMP MADE, AND WE WERE LIKE, I GUESS WE WILL LET THE GUY WHO RUNS A GIANT OIL CONGLOMERATE TAKE OVER FOREIGN AFFAIRS. BECAUSE RELATIVE TO THE OTHER INCOMPETENTS LIKE RICK PERRY, HE LOOKS AWESOME. YOU CAN SUCCEED IN POLITICS ACCIDENTALLY, RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT GLASSES I'VE MADE THE WRONG DECISION. I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT MY OTHER POINT IS, BUT OH, THE ANTI-SEMITISM AND RACISM AND HATE SPEECH GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, A DANGEROUS ISSUE, AND YET THE MEDIA WE HAVE MOSTLY THE TELEVISION MEDIA THROUGH THE WAY THEY OPERATE, BASED ON OUR NEED TO COVER BOTH SIDES WITH WHAT WE DESCRIBE AS FAIRNESS, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE MOST NONVIOLENT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, COMMUNITY THEATER ACTORS, RIGHT, AND KATHY GRIFFIN, WHO DOES SOMETHING DISTASTEFUL IN AN ARTISTIC ATTEMPT GONE AWRY, AND A FAILURE, THAT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT AS SORT OF, HATE SPEECH, THEN WE HAVE GROUPS THAT LEGITIMATELY WANT TO KILL JEWS AND LEX AND LATINOS, BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE'S KATHY GRIFFIN WHO'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING VIOLENT IN HER ENTIRE LIFE BUT DID SOMETHING AND TO BE DISTASTEFUL, AND WE EQUATE THE TWO, AND KELLYANNE CONWAY GOES ON TV AND WE WILL MENTION KATHY GRIFFIN AND JULIUS CAESAR FOREVER EVEN THOUGH NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS SHOULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL NEWS AND ACTUAL THREATS, DISTASTEFUL AS KATHY GRIFFIN'S DECISION WAS. AND IDIOTS LIKE ME HAVE TO END EVERY THOUGHT ABOUT KATHY RIVEN BY SAYING I THINK IT WAS DISTASTEFUL, WHICH I DO, BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. LOOK AT THE NEWS COVERAGE OF KATHY GRIFFIN VERSUS THE PORTLAND STABBINGS. ACTUAL VIOLENCE BASED ON RELIGIOUS HATRED VERSUS HER STUPID PICTURE.
