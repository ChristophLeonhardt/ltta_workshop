.
MARK: HELLO, AMERICA.
I'M MARK LEVIN.
THIS IS "LIFE, LIBERTY &
LEVIN."
WE HAVE TWO GREAT GUESTS.
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, HOW ARE YOU?
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.
MARK: JOE CONCHA, GOOD TO SEE
YOU.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME WANT.
>> TO TALK ABOUT THE MEDIA
TODAY.
ESPECIALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE RECENT MEDIA AND EVENTS
THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE AND
HOW THE MEDIA HAS COVERED THEM,
AND NO BETTER TIME TO TALK
ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION
THAN NOW.
THE MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER SAYS
THAT 90% OF THE NEWS COVERAGE
HAS BEEN NEGATIVE TOWARD
KAVANAUGH.
HONESTLY, I'M SURPRISED IT'S
THAT LOW.
IT LOOKS LIKE 99.9% TO ME.
YOU'VE BOTH WRITTEN ABOUT THIS.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS,
MOLLIE?
>> I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A
TELLING COUPLE OF WEEKS AS WE
WATCHED THE MEDIA COVER A VERY
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AND VERY
COMPLICATED ISSUE.
HAVE YOU ALLEGATIONS OF ASSAULT
AND YOU HAVE A MAN WHO'S
DENYING THEM AND THE MEDIA
COVERAGE, I DON'T THINK COULD
HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.
WHEN YOU SAW THE STANDARDS IN
STORIES, USUALLY AS A
JOURNALIST, HAVE YOU IDEAS WHAT
STANDARD MUST BE MET BEFORE YOU
PUBLISH A STORY.
I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF
PUBLICATIONS HAVE NOT HELD TO
THE NORMALLY HIGH STANDARDS,
PUBLISHING ALLEGATIONS AS
FARCICAL, RUNNING WITH STORIES
THAT THERE IS NO CORROBORATION
AND FORGETTING THIS IS A VERY
SERIOUS ISSUE.
THIS IS A REAL MAN ACCUSED OF
SOMETHING AND HAS NO EVIDENCE
TO SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION.
HAD HIS LIFE AND NAME AND HONOR
AND REPUTATION DRAGGED THROUGH
THE MUD.
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION, IT'S
ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE
AND HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE ACCUSED
OF CRIMES.
MARK: SEEMS LIKE BASIC NORMS.
DUE PROCESS, YOU KNOW, THESE
THINGS THAT WESTERN
CIVILIZATION HAS CREATED OVER
THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
YEARS.
DUE PROCESS, PRESUMPTION OF
INNOCENCE, EVIDENCE, A STANDARD
OF PROOF.
ALL THESE THINGS WENT OUT OF
WINDOW.
DID THEY NOT, JOE?
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH, BY MANY IN
THE MEDIA WAS DEEMED GUILTY
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.
YOU BROUGHT UP THE MEDIA
RESEARCH CENTER.
344 MINUTES DEDICATED TO
ACCUSER'S ACCUSATIONS OF
KAVANAUGH.
21 MINUTES TO KAVANAUGH'S
DENIALS.
I BELIEVE THAT'S MORE IN THE
15-1 RATIO AND I COMPARE IT TO
THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS,
EVERYTHING WENT OFF THE CLIFF
FINANCIALLY.
FOR OUR MEDIA EVERYTHING WENT
OFF THE CLIFF.
PEOPLE WERE HOLDING OUT HOPE
BECAUSE THIS IS A SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE AND THE HEARING THAT AS
I GO AROUND, SOME SEMBLANCE OF
BALANCE, AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
HERE.
I'LL GIVE YOU SEE STORIES.
USA TODAY, A SPORTS COLUMNIST
WRITES AN OP-ED SAYING BRETT
KAVANAUGH SHOULD NO LONGER BE
AROUND YOUNG GIRLS AND COACH
HIS DAUGHTER'S BASKETBALL TEAM
BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE'S SHOWN
TO ACT AROUND YOUNG GIRLS.
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S NOW A
PEDOPHILE.
THEY HAD TO RETRACT PART OF
THAT STORY.
NBC NEWS PUTS JULIE SWETNICK
REPRESENTED BY MICHAEL
KARDASHIANI -- I'M SORRY,
MICHAEL AVENATTI, TO MAKE THE
CLAIMS AGAINST KAVANAUGH
ACCUSING HIM OF GANG RAPE.
AND APPARENTLY, SHE HAS THREE
YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND
WENT BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL
PARTIES, WHICH IN MY DAY, IF
ANYBODY FROM COLLEGE CAME BACK
TO A HIGH SCHOOL PARTY ONE YEAR
OUT, THAT WAS WEIRD.
TWO YEARS OUT, THREE YEARS OUT,
YOU ARE PROBABLY CALLING THE
POLICE.
AND BY THE WAY, THERE IS GANG
RAPES GOING ON.
WHY ARE YOU GOING BACK THERE?
NBC SAYS AS A DISCLAIMER, WE
CANNOT CORROBORATE ANYTHING
THAT SWETNICK IS SAYING.
INSTEAD OF KILLING THE
INTERVIEW, WHICH DO YOU IN
THOSE SITUATIONS, THEY WANT TO
BE FIRST INSTEAD OF ACCURATE
AND GIVE HER A NATIONAL STAGE
ANYWAY.
NUMBER THREE, "NEW YORK TIMES"
STORY.
BRETT KAVANAUGH THREW ICE
DURING AN ALTERCATION AT YALE
IN 1985 IN A BAR.
NO CHARGES WERE ACTUALLY
LEVELED IN THIS SITUATION, BUT
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" GOES AHEAD
WITH IT ANYWAY, AND BY THE WAY,
ONE OF THE CO WRITERS OF THE
STORY IS AN ANTI-KAVANAUGH
CRITIC, IF YOU LOOK AT HER
TWITTER FEED, THE PAPER HAS TO
RETRACT, NOT THE STORY, ADMIT
THEY MADE A MISTAKE AND SAID
LITERALLY SHE IS NOT A NEWS
REPORTER, SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ASSIGNED TO IT.
HOW THE HELL DID SHE GET THERE?
YOU LOOK AT THE THREE EXAMPLE
US AND SAY TO YOURSELF, MY
GOODNESS, OUR MEDIA IS BROKEN,
AND MANY, MANY PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY WILL NEVER, EVER TRUST
IT AGAIN.
MARK: MOLLIE, DO YOU THINK THIS
WAS A WATERSHED?
DOWNING THE MEDIA HAVE EXPOSED
THEMSELVES IN THE AGGREGATE AS
UTTERLY IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN.
DO THE MEDIA LEAD THE DEMOCRATS
OR THE DEMOCRATS LEAD THE
MEDIA?
>> USED TO SEEM THE DEMOCRATS
WERE THE HEAD OF THE PARTY,
DIRECTING WHAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD
BE DOING.
THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM
BECAUSE THE MEDIA SHOULD BE AT
LEAST TRYING TO ATTAIN SOME
STANDARD OF OBJECTIVITY.
AND I THINK THE MEDIA HAS HAD A
LOT OF BENEFIT BASED ON THIS
VIEW THAT THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO REPORT THE
FACTS.
WE'VE GIVEN THEM A LOT OF
CREDIBILITY AND HONOR AND, YES,
THIS IS A WATERSHED MOMENT IN
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
APPALLED BY WHAT THEY'VE SEEN.
WE HAD THREE REALLY GOOD
EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS SO BAD.
BUT, IN FACT THE LAST FEW
DECADES HAVE BEEN -- INCLUDING
A LOT OF THESE MOMENTS.
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE TRUMP
VICTORY WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE
ABOUT WHY THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP?
A LOT OF PEOPLE MENTIONED THEY
WERE SO FRUSTRATED WITH THE
MEDIA COVERAGE.
IN APOLITICAL COVERAGE, PEOPLE
ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE WAY THE
MEDIA COVER A NATURAL DISASTER
OR CELEBRITY OR NUMBER OF
THINGS.
YES, THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT
MOMENT.
PEOPLE COULD NOT -- PEOPLE
COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING OTHER
THAN HOW BIASED EVERYBODY WAS
BEING, BUT IT'S JUST ACTUALLY
THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF
PROBLEMS.
MARK: YOU KNOW, JOE, EVEN TED
TURNER, THE FOUNDER OF CNN AND
TED KOPPEL, THE OTHER DAY, HE
WAS ON A PANEL, THEY WERE
CRITICAL OF CNN.
TOO POLITICAL.
WHAT WOULD CNN DO?
WHAT WOULD THE RATINGS BE IF
DONALD TRUMP WASN'T AROUND?
>> KOPPEL SAID THEY WOULD BE IN
THE TOILET.
MARK: IN THE TOILET.
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS, WHAT
REALLY IS CNN AT THIS POINT?
IS IT A NEWS ORGANIZATION?
OPINION ORGANIZATION?
IS IT BOTH?
IS IT NEITHER?
WHAT IS IT?
>> I'LL LET JEFF GREENFIELD WHO
IS WITH CNN, ABC, CBS, HE'S
BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR
DECADES, PRETTY WELL RESPECTED.
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD BRIAN ON
RELIABLE SOURCES LAST SUNDAY.
WHEN I LOOK AT CNN, HOUR AFTER
HOUR AFTER HOUR I SEE PANELS
RATHER THAN REPORTING,
EXCHANGING OPINIONS.
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF
WHICH ON THIS NETWORK I REGARD
AS QUITE CRITICAL OR HOSTILE TO
TRUMP.
THIS IS A GUEST IN THE FORMER
EMPLOYEE OF THE NETWORK TELLING
A CNN ANCHOR THIS IS WHO YOU
ARE NOW.
>> BUT I ACTUALLY THINK --.
>> AS YOU SAID TED TURNER AND
KOPPEL AS WELL CRITICIZED THE
NETWORK ALL IN ONE WEEK.
YOU'RE NOT JUST NOTICING THAT.
AND WE'VE SEEN IT FOR A WHILE,
I USED TO GO ON THE NETWORK
QUITE OFTEN.
IT'S A DIFFERENT NETWORK THAN
THREE YEARS AGO, DONALD TRUMP
CAME ONTO THE SCENE.
THEY USED TO FILM EMPTY PODIUMS
DURING THE CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF
HILLARY CLINTON GIVING A SPEECH
BECAUSE HE RATED AND THOUGHT HE
WOULD NEVER WIN.
ONCE HE WON THEY'VE GONE
OVERWHELMINGLY ANTI-TRUMP AND
HARVARD CAME OUT WITH A STUDY,
THEY ARE 91% NEGATIVE TOWARDS
THE PRESIDENT.
HOW DO YOU SAY YOU'RE OBJECTIVE
WHEN NUMBERS LIKE THAT DON'T
SUPPORT IT.
>> IT'S WORSE THAN IF IT WERE
JUST OPINIONS, JUST PANELISTS
GIVING ANALYSIS.
IT'S THE NEWS REPORTING THAT IS
A SERIOUS PROBLEM, TOO.
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES YOU GAVE
WAS OF AN OPINION COLUMN BUT A
LOT OF WHAT WE SAW THAT WAS SO
BAD WITH THE KAVANAUGH STORY IS
DONE BY PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY
ARE STREET REPORTERS.
EXAMPLES FROM CNN, YOU HAVE THE
EX-BOYFRIEND OF THE INITIAL
ACCUSER AGAINST KAVANAUGH SAID
STUFF HE THOUGHT WAS WORTH
SHARING AND THE ACCUSER HAD
ONCE COACHED A FRIEND WHEN
LATER SHE TESTIFIED SHE DIDN'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT POLYGRAPHS
AND A VARIETY OF CLAIMS SHE WAS
MAKING.
THEY DIDN'T REPORT THAT.
THEY ONLY REPORTED WHEN SOMEONE
DENIED THE CLAIM.
>> THAT'S CALLED BIAS OF
OMISSION.
YOU CAN BE OUTWARDLY BIAS IF
YOU ARE AN ANCHOR AND CLEARLY
SUPPORTING ONE SIDE.
IF YOU WATCH CNN, YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW THAT HAPPENED.
ONE OTHER PROBLEM THAT THEY
HAVE IS THEY LABEL ANCHORS WHO
ARE NOT ANCHORS.
THEY ARE OPINION PEOPLE.
DON LEMON IS STILL CALLED AN
ANCHOR AT 10:00 TONIGHT.
CHRIS CUOMO AN ANCHOR AT NIGHT.
ANDERSON COOPER IS AN ANCHOR AT
8:00.
THEY ARE CLEARLY GIVING
OPINIONS, AND THAT CONFLATING
THE TWO THINGS BUILDS TO MORE
MISTRUST.
WHEN YOU ARE NOT LABELING
PEOPLE AS THEY SHOULD BE.
NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING AN
OPINION PERSON.
HANNITY, INGRAHAM, CARLSON.
MARK LEVIN, YOU ARE OPINION
PEOPLE.
EMBRACE IT.
STOP PRETENDING YOU ARE ANCHORS
WHEN YOU DON'T FIT THE LABEL,
ASKING QUESTIONS AND GETTING TO
THE FACTS.
MARK: LET ME ASK YOU THIS TOO,
THOUGH.
I WATCHED SOME OF THE COVERAGE,
A LOT OF THE COVERAGE, MOST OF
THE COVERAGE, OF THE KAVANAUGH
HEARINGS, AND I WAS VERY
UNIMPRESSED WITH MOST OF THE
ANALYSTS, QUOTE, UNQUOTE.
THEY WERE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF
RACHEL MITCHELL WHO WAS HIRED
BY THE REPUBLICANS, THE
MARICOPA COUNTY SEXUAL CRIMES
PROSECUTOR, INTERRUPTED BY THE
FIVE-MINUTE RULE WHICH WAS VERY
ANNOYING, BUT YOU COULD TELL,
THE AUDIENCE COULD TELL, SHE
WAS GOING THROUGH IT
METHODICALLY, POINTING OUT THE
CONTRADICTIONS, POINTING OUT
THE LACK OF CORROBORATION AND
SHE WAS TRASHED.
ALMOST UNIFORMLY.
THEY BRING IN PROFESSORS WHO
TRASHED HER, SOME OF THE
ANALYSTS ARE TRASHING HER.
I WENT ON THE RADIO AND SAID
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY
LAYING OUT THE CASE AND SOME OF
THE PROBLEMS WITH DR. FORD.
DID YOU SEE THAT TOO?
>> YEAH, IT WAS VERY
FRUSTRATING TO WATCH BECAUSE IF
YOU ARE A CASUAL OBSERVER AND
SAW HER GOING THROUGH THE
QUESTIONS, WELL, PROFESSOR FORD
WAS ANSWERING AND REVEALING A
LOT OF INTERESTING INFORMATION,
SUCH AS THAT IT WAS FALSE SHE
WAS AFRAID TO FLIGHT.
SHE'S A GLOBAL FREQUENT FLYER,
AND YET IN PREVIOUS WEEKS WE
HEARD SHE COULDN'T FLY OUT TO
THE HEARING BECAUSE SHE HAD A
DEATHLY FEAR OF FLYING.
BRINGING OUT INCONSISTENCIES
THAT FLOODED THE ZONE OF THE
MEDIA THAT YOU BEGIN TO THINK
THROUGH THIS MORE SERIOUSLY.
AND YET WHEN YOU SAW PEOPLE
ANALYZE MITCHELL'S QUESTIONING
AND PROFESSOR FORD AND EVEN
KAVANAUGH'S STATEMENTS,
EVERYBODY RESPONDED SO
EMOTIONALLY RATHER THAN
LOGICALLY.
I UNDERSTAND EMOTION IS
IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.
BUT SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF
REASON AND LOGIC AND PRINCIPLES
THAT WERE IN PLAY, TOO.
YOU DON'T CONVICT SOMEONE IN
ANY COURT BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE
IT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE.
NOBODY POINTED OUT GOING INTO
THE HEARING LAST WEEK, THERE
WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE
ALLEGATIONS.
COMING OUT OF THE HEARING,
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO
SUPPORT THE ALLEGATIONS.
THAT WAS NOT A MAJOR THEME.
ANALYSIS, AND IT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN.
I DON'T REALLY CARE, SOME
PEOPLE MIGHT FIND PROFESSOR
FORD CREDIBLE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD PROBLEMS
WITH THE TESTIMONY AND IT HAD A
LOT OF GAPS THAT DIDN'T MAKE
SENSE.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING
THROUGH IN THE NEWS COVERAGE OR
IN THE ANALYSIS EITHER.
THERE'S NO REASON THERE
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A STRAIGHT
NEWS STORY LAYING OUT THE FLAWS
AND INCONSISTENCIES WITH
TESTIMONY.
>> PEOPLE WANTED A FEW GOOD MEN
AND COLONEL JESSOP AND JACK
NICHOLSON AND TOM CRUISE AND
CRUISE WONDERING, DID YOU ORDER
THE CODE RED?
AND OBVIOUSLY NICHOLSON SAYS
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DID.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED OUT OF
THE PROSECUTOR OR JOHNNIE
COCHRAN IN THE O.J. HEARINGS,
IF IT DOESN'T FIT, YOU MUST
ACQUIT.
SOMETHING THAT RHYMES, IF IT'S
METHODICAL AND FACT BASED THAT
DOESN'T PLAY WELL IN CABLE FUSE
FOR PUNDITS.
THEY WANT DRAMA.
MARK: LET ME FOLLOW UP, YOU ARE
MAKING AN IMPORTANT POINT.
IS THE AUDIENCE SMARTER THAN
THE PEOPLE MAKE THE
PRESENTATIONS IN THE MEDIA?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION, THE
HILL DOES AN ANALYSIS OF ALL
THE MAJOR NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY AND THEIR ENDORSEMENTS.
AND WE NARROWED IT DOWN TO 59
PAPERS BASED ON, I BELIEVE, SU
SUBSCRIPTION LEVELS.
59 ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON, 12
ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP.
THAT GOT HER A CONCESSION
SPEECH.
WE COULD DO OUR THINKING ON OUR
OWN, THANK YOU.
I GO BACK TO THAT STAT AS THE
INFLUENCE OF THE MEDIA IS
ONE-TENTH OF WHAT IT USED TO BE
GOING BACK IN ANOTHER TIME I
WON'T NAME.
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO
HAVE GOOD REPORTERS JUST
REPORTING THE FACTS BUT
ANALYSTS WHO ACTUALLY REPRESENT
THAT PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
ACTUALLY IGNORED OR DERIDED IN
THE MEDIA.
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THE MEDIA
WITH YOUR OWN EYES AND HEAR
PEOPLE MAKING ANALYSIS THAT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND PEOPLE
FOCUSED ON EMOTION AND FOR
BEING FOCUSED ON EMOTION BEING
BIASED IN HOW THEY'RE FOCUSED
ON EMOTION BECAUSE BOTH
PROFESSOR FORD AND JUDGE
KAVANAUGH GAVE VERY EMOTIONAL
TESTIMONY BUT ONLY ONE SEEMED
TO GET THE BENEFIT FROM A LOT
OF ANALYSTS.
>> JOURNALISTS PRIMARILY LIVE
IN NEW YORK, WASHINGTON AND LOS
ANGELES.
>> YES.
>> AND DON'T REPRESENT THE
MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY.
BOB SCHAFER SAID ONE IN FIVE
JOURNALISTS, ONLY THREE CITIES,
AND 20% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK
IN THE BUSINESS LIVE IN THOSE
PLACES.
CALLED THE JOURNALISTIC
CORRIDOR THAT WE'RE ON
PARTICULARLY WITH NEW YORK AND
WASHINGTON, AND LIVING IN
BUBBLES OR ELITE TOWERS AND NOT
LISTENING TO PEOPLE.
WHEN I GO TO PARTIES, I WAS AT
A BLOCK PARTY AND THERE WAS A
KEG.
MARK: DID YOU THROW ICE?
>> I DID THROW ICE.
I THREW A BAG FOR A GAME, AND I
GOT FEEDBACK THAT I WAS NOT
SEEING ON TELEVISION,
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CAME TO
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD OR JULIE
SWETNICK OR ANYBODY ELSE
INVOLVED.
GO TO A BAR, MAYBE YOU WILL GET
ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE.
MARK: ALMOST EVERY WEEK NIGHT
