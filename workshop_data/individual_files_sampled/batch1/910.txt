Africa Tatia maca he's a social and political commentator with a special focus on Zimbabwe and John Dramani Mahama he's the former president of Ghana and is the head of a Commonwealth observer group one of the organization's monitoring Zimbabwe's elections welcome everyone to the stream mr. president I want to start with you because we tweeted out to our community of viewers you'd be on the show with your eye on the Zimbabwean elections and here are two accounts we got back Tina here says the actual voting the casting of ballots was very peaceful and there was no recorded incident in my area on the other hand we got this from Joe Black Zimbabwe who says a whole polling station went missing and goro munzee and the Electoral Commission is failing or refusing to post result forms at a fifth of polling stations is there any practical action that you mr. president can take or shall it barely be mentioned under irregularities as usual from your initial assessment what is your take on how the voting has gone well the perturbation of voting can be categorized into three distinct parts the period before the election whether there is a level playing field and people have the opportunity to be able to campaign and take their message to the people the next part is voting day actually where people come out to vote at the polling stations laid out well are they accessible are people able to cast their votes in secret and how did the counting go and then the third part is after voting and that is the telling of the results we give a arrival interview which was based on reports that we had picked up from a pre-assessment team but we also spoke to all the stakeholders and in the arrival interview we indicated when our thoughts were about the environment before the election all the political parties told us that they had been free to combust votes from across the country it was unlike previous elections where there were no good areas where some political parties could not go into certain areas of the barbary and so with access to campaigning I think that the political parties expressed satisfaction let me share this with you if I make as I was on your - on your Twitter feed here and begin your picture talking to people what's the atmosphere like because there's a certain amount of what you're doing which is wrote and by the numbers but you're meeting people out in Zimbabwe what was the atmosphere like what did you feel about this election the atmosphere was one of enthusiasm everywhere I went in to all the polling stations I took the opportunity to speak to the voters who were killed up and asking what the expectations were and I must commend Zimbabweans they came out in their numbers we don't have the official turnout yet more but they stood in queues in some cases the queues were quite long but they had the patience to stand in the queues and wait so they attend to cast their votes and so it was very enthusiastic atmosphere people work into boats and make their voices head alright president jhemini Mihama thank you very much for joining us to talk about what it is like to be chair of the Commonwealth group of observers currently working in Zimbabwe right now Thank You mr. president for joining us do do people were voting for you what was it like for you knowing that this election is historic election that it was a little different from any other election in in your lifetime well I was living excited that they actually people who believed in me who actually voted for me even if I did not win the election and the excitement was everyone was just feeling like this is the time for change and this was like a new election after 37 years of kookaburras rule and it was like starting all over again let me show you this this I found on your Twitter feed and it's from Khun dye and could I says we are not defined by the things that don't go our way I admire your courage and hard work you fought a good fight take the disappointments and work on them and basically you are one of the people who know that you didn't win you didn't get the office that you ran for local government office and she saying don't give up the number of young people who actually were in contention what does that say about Zimbabwe right now a lot of young people because I think young people decided to be the change started to step up and sorry to be the leaders because they are the next generation in its era to take destiny into their own hands so all the young people now feel like it's time for them to participate in the governance processes in the politics of the country and to be the change in to bring development and change in the country taffey I'm just looking here for al-jazeera's rundown at the Zimbabwe elections 2018 voting at a glance the registered voters the 23 presidential candidates what do you make of iron yeah well I think it was a much freer environment than it was in previous elections and I think that created a lot of optimism around this electoral process but I I still feel that the election was not entirely free and fair I think the voting was fairly peaceful I think the campaign's were done in a very optimal environment but I don't think the process in itself was entirely free or fair I think everything was tilted towards certain appeal from the government Linda you're in contention you were trying to get a parliamentary seat what Tuffy says that it's like he's not convinced that this is a free and fair election from your perspective how did it go as a candidate I have a totally different experience I actually believe it was free and fair I I ran my race I put my best foot forward and I accept the results that came through I can't fault sig according to me on the ground as a candidate the process has been actually very transparent from a candidates first point of view so I I hear that point and I think that a lot of people online agree with you but then there is this sentiment from a couple people why is it taking so long for Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwean election Electoral Commission to release the results so I'll share two things here from the candidates two of them themselves Delson Janissa winning resoundingly we now have results from the majority of the over 10,000 polling stations this was as of July 30th we've done exceedingly well we're awaiting the Electoral Commission to perform their constitutional duty to officially announce the people's election results and we're ready to form the next government of course the incumbent though is also tweeting patience is a virtue you can see it in several of his tweets here emerson moon and agua tawanda I'm wondering if you can answer our original tweeters question on why it's taking so long and is that something that's unusual now definitely something that we are worried about is observers to the election process but normally I think 24 hours after polling page you would expect the Election Commission to have managed to collect all election results and at least they have to add them getting transmitted to the national tally Center this appears to not have happened and the question is Oh why what's going on and and we've been raised in this with the Electoral Commission so now as we speak the Electoral Commission has been issuing out a result for House of Assembly elections and our argument to them has been that these result they've already been declared as a constituency center why not just proceed to announce the presidential results which have not yet been declared rather than repeating to announce the results that that have already been declared anyway so so it's it's a bit worrying and our regulations in terms of our election should be no election result should be handled quite clear when the result moved from the polling station to the white coalition send them to the Constituent percenter that declared the appropriate levels and when they get to the National Center what should happen is that the presidential result should be the ones that are declared at that level we have not yet seen this of course we've got five days to announce the results but given the experience in 2008 him by this time and one of the results would have been announced so this is something that we a bit worried about we think it raises questions around transparency and accountability on the part of the Election Commission clean not much information has been given in terms of what is going on so the danger of not concluding the announcement of the cloud is that it raises tensions and people ultimately get worried about what going when suspicions are raised and we definitely would want to hear the Election Commission allay peers and so that people can become ultimately so that the the post-election period is characterized by tranquillity by peaceful quaint systems and so on this is what we want at the end of the day and we and we hope okay google get answers from the Electoral Commission taffy yeah just to hang on to what to understand I think there's so many things that the MDC Alliance for example asked for before the election from Zek during the election and after the election and I think what we've pretty much seen is that zeg has not been responding positively to many of the things that have been brought up by the MDC alliance so when I for example speak of an election not being free and fair I'm looking at very critical points as in how the votes are counted but even more before the election I'm looking at the state media was biased towards an appeal and government which has been the case since 1980 and definitely there was an issue where throughout the campaign both managua and cheering were used the power of incumbency to the maximum and created a situation where you couldn't really tell the difference between government and party functions and things of that nature so I think fundamentally this election looks free and fair but I think when we when all the results have been released and we look back on everything there might be a lot of critical things that actually might have helped the incumbent to stay in power if he does manage yeah I want to bring up this this perspective this is from Sidibe on Twitter and he's referencing something that a lot of people are referencing that we can't even talk about this election without talking about former President Mugabe Sidibe says whoever emerges the new president of Zimbabwe will have mcgaffeys shadow to bury first a new Zimbabwe isn't possible without peeling Mugabe his claws from the country so some strong words there dude is la but do you think that this is a fair point I think he's right in some sense because remember these Mugabe the person in Linda's Mugabe decision so for me I believe that this system has been day for 38 years and it's the one that is been causing all these things and that system has to be let go let go that system says we can start afresh so that system has been affecting us in our country so that system is deeply rooted and it has to be totally done off with if what you progress as a country do do this is something that you shared earlier with people who follow you on twitter congratulations mr. president are you calling the election right now to wonders already said the results are delayed this is this smacks of maybe not being too transparent and here you are is this not mischief-making in such an important election okay for I'm just saying congratulations on the achievement of you running this election but you could be so mr. president what that's your nickname for him what is that oh he's the president for a party okay all right so I mean this is one of the things that I'm thinking about Linda about this idea of - MS er managua these two very prominent leaders and and frontrunners if one of them wins and the other one doesn't say okay I agree you've won is that a concern that Zimbabweans have right now yeah obviously if one does not concede if you do not consider an election obviously tensions will rise and we do not know which way it could go but at the end of the day if one does not concede it's the citizens who suffer honestly so there's this idea also about the momentum of the MDC and being pushed along taffy how would you like to unpack that a little bit for us it should be the stratum of the MDC where we're team is er is but we're doing really well right now the MTC is doing really well yeah well well the other problem is we don't have we don't have official results but I can understand where he's coming from he went into this with a lot of momentum as you said there and he he feels is close to victory but I think the problem is he entered the election knowing that there were a lot of things that could go against him and I mean we can't say for sure that anything anything untoward has been done as yet but I think the longer the results the longer take Zach to announce the results the stronger the suspicions that it might be slipping away from Jimmy so will grow so I so I think he's trying to keep people it's only keep people hyped up and probably in in the mode where if necessary they can go down the streets to defend what they feel was they vote to win so I think that's the situation we're in right now and what it is that they are defending for so many people is bigger than just who wins but the policies that then will be enacted so when asking our community what is it that you want the president to tackle when they get into office we got several comments that look like this Thaksin says tackle the economy and create jobs another person sent us a video comment with what is most important to them and for them this is a Hillary who's a Zimbabwean researcher based in South Africa now and this is what he told the stream there is no youth what a party to talk about in the 2018 elections in Zimbabwe because 60% of the registered voters were aged between 18 and 14 and with a 75% water turnout that makes young people became changes in these elections the young people have voted they have decided who they want to be led with for the next five years and to that leader they are asking for access to means of production access to capital access to land for housing and for farming purposes it's happy what do you make of that comment I agree with I think I think the selection or perhaps the two parties I think that appeal symbolizes a more conservative view of Zimbabwe and the MDC Alliance symbolizes a more youthful perhaps progressive view of Zimbabwe and I think many urban youth I'm not sure on roots but I think many urban youth have have been drawn towards the MDC Alliance because I think they've never really experienced a Zimbabwe that it's not in economic turmoil this crisis that we have for example has been running for close to twenty years and if you're a teen for example you were born to smack in the middle of a crisis and you're still living with it up to now so having a lot of people and a lot of young people putting their they their hopes into Mesa introducing some sort of new dispensation that that is way different from the currency that we know because the last time Sabah had a strong economy for all intents and purposes was 1997 so you can understand that divide the years between the young and elderly mmm you know you spoke the words one of our YouTube commenters it's thinking almost exactly a boss here tweeting and or excuse me being on YouTube writing and saying I would love to see Jim use to get elected because of him being relatively younger and then more relatable to the public duties la do you agree with that yes I do we are population is mainly young people and tamizha is the young president would actually relate with us because it's asked the generation that is the majority of the population and we're the ones that have been suffering the most and we are seeing him as an agent of change one was able to address the issues that were facing his young people because he's all for young Linda the economy is so important it's something that you as a businessman I really appreciate now whether you're in Parliament are not in Parliament how do you feel that the the next administration should be tackling issues about the economy and wealth in Zimbabwe we need a president who works hard and we need a president who has or other is keen to re-engage the community's international communities we had been previously shut out from so with regards to the economy we need to get back to production once I once upon a time tweeted that we need a president who is willing to be a villain for a short while literally shut down is in for a bit and asked us to pull our sleeves up and work for them this has been an exhausting campaign for you I can tell just from some of the the energy that you put into it that you poured into it I want to show your stop page here your campaigning stub page when you were fresh and ready for the fight I'm feeling the exhaustion from you and also from doo doo but what are you gonna do with that exhaustion for me right now I decided to take a break today and I'm taking my loss by the chin I'm going back full-time into business and looking forward to some of the projects that had been working on that I didn't have time to work on in the last nine months so I'm really looking forward through that honestly yeah and do you what about you next steps because a what happens is it by the way it can't just be left to the politicians it's not just their job to remake a Zimbabwe is it supposed to be filled by everybody I'm gonna play my part in building a better Zimbabwe my losing the election doesn't mean I have to stop tomorrow if I can to see the Bobby getting to that place that we want to see it but at the moment I'm taking a break most of them cuz I was also doing my businesses some projects that I have and I'm also doing an MBA so I need to really concentrate on that and I'm also going to do some community development projects in the local community that I reside in which I had planned to do whether I win or not the election I hate to go from such a hopeful note and the positive things that are going to happen in your life and for the country because of you with this tweet but there are a couple people who are bringing this topic up too and dr. Ellis on Twitter says the greatest fear is one not accepting defeat and then throwing our country into a crisis again in the last couple minutes of our show - andhe is this one of the fears that you share or do you think it's not valid definitely I think it's a fear that is there especially given the quality of the election process as we have seen it so far one of the reasons why we continue to say that we need to have a credible election process which is concluded in a minute that is acceptable to all these that dude wants to really limit potential areas of dispute around the election process which will then raise the question of acceptability of the results now in spite of the fact that we've said the country has been peaceful in the lead-up to this election there is no doubt that there's been massive polarization yeah and any misunderstandings regarding how the action process has been conducted and the potential to trigger what we have seen in previous elections in Zimbabwe and this is one of our greatest fears ends our insistence to the Election Commission that they need to exercise a lot of transparent and accountable administration of the outstanding election issues all right Oh under that seems a very reasonable place to end our conversation for now so Linda and Towanda and dudu and taffy thank you very much for being part of the program and earlier on we had President John Dramani Mahama from the Commonwealth group of observers thank you for watching Malik and I will see you online we'll always on Twitter act a straight sees next time
