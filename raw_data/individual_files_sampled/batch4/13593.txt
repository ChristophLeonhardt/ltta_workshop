president Trump's press conference the Putin should be twofold one it should be people saying that was really inappropriate the President of the United States should never be dumping his own intelligence services under the bus for a KGB agent and number two let's look at the practical ramifications what he did so doesn't mean the Putin's going to invade surrounding countries probably not doesn't mean that Vladimir Putin is gonna get more aggressive on the world stage maybe maybe not although less having got aggressive on the world stage we bombed Syria doesn't mean that the intelligence agencies are gonna feel a lot more unjustified Heat yes doesn't mean that there's gonna be more political dissension in the United States yes was good no okay that I think is a relatively objective take on what is going to come out from all of this because President Trump operates pretty independently of his own administration his own administration when it comes time to make policy actually goes and makes the policy and Trump says a lot of stuff I've been saying it for literally years literally years that his slogan shouldn't be make America great again it should be I say a lot of stuff because Trump says a lot of stuff okay and that means that a lot of people don't take the stuff he says particularly seriously I don't think Vladimir Putin takes Trump seriously enough on policy he's gonna go invade surrounding countries believing the Trump is gonna allow him to do that and it is important to mention that in this terrible press conference from did say at least one good thing he said listen we still have our disagreements about Crimea he didn't come out and say listen Putin gets to keep Crimea he said that the United States and Putin disagree on Crimea when it comes to territorial aggression by the Russians Trump did not signal weakness he signaled weakness when it came to Russian interference in American elections and he signaled weakness because his own egotism got in the way of his better sense I think okay so that's the practical tank the non practical take is Trump is a traitor Trump is a Russian agent all of this is because Trump is some sort of Manchurian Candidate and yet that's exactly what Democrats are suggesting which is what Putin wants what Putin wants is to drive chaos in the United States his actual goal is to make us all hate each other and suspicious of each other and think that we are all foreign agents of an evil power that that is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants and the Democrats are eager to jump to that because they think they're gonna make electoral gain off the back of that and they may be right okay there was a generic ballot a generic congressional ballot out yesterday it shows Democrats are back up to an eight point lead which is wave territory for Republicans so Democrats think that the the more overboard they go on this stuff the better it is for them electorally it may very well be but it ain't good for the country here's Chuck Schumer yesterday saying millions of people are going to wonder if Putin has dirt on Trump after Trump's behavior millions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over president Trump okay why would you give credence to that there's not a lot of credence to that why wouldn't just say the obvious again the obvious thing is that president it's the unifying feature of all of the silly things he's done whether it is firing Komi precipitously or whether it is attempting to defend Mike Flynn or whether it's something to defend Paul mana for or whether it was what he did with Putin yesterday or whether it's him talking about firing rod Rosenstein
