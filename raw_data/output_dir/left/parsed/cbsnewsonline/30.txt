ALLEGATIONS. 
AN INVESTIGATION WHICH WAS THEN 
SEVERELY CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS BLAME US 
FOR THIS PROCESS, THEY ARE 
ALWAYS FINDING A STRAW MAN, BUT 
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 
THE TRUTH, FIRST, THEY BLAME US 
FOR DELAY, KNOWING FULL WELL 
THAT MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 
McCONNELL HAS COMPLETE CONTROL 
OF WHEN NOMINEES ARE BROUGHT TO 
THE FLOOR. 
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL COULD 
HAVE MOVED THE NOMINEE TWO 
WEEKS AGO OR ONE WEEK AGO. 
DEMOCRATS HAD NO SAY, AND DON'T,
WHEN IT COMES TO WHO COMES TO 
THE FLOOR, BUT IN EACH CASE, 
LEADER McCONNELL COULDN'T MOVE 
HIM FORWARD BECAUSE HE WAS 
BLOCKED BY FELLOW REPUBLICANS, 
NOT DEMOCRATS, FROM MOVING 
FORWARD. 
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLAINING 
ABOUT THE LAKE, TWO WORDS NEVER 
COME FROM OUR REPUBLICAN 
FRIENDS LIPS, MERRICK GARLAND. 
REPUBLICANS ARE ALSO SAYING WE 
ENGAGED IN A SMEAR CAMPAIGN, 
WHERE THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL 
DESTRUCTION WERE WITH THIS 
NOMINATION, IN REALITY, THEY 
ARE USING DEMOCRATS AS A STRAW 
MAN, WHAT THEY'RE REALLY 
TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT DR. FORD 
SAID.  
DEMOCRATS DID NOT INDUCE HER TO 
COME FORWARD, HER CONSCIENCE 
DID. 
AND ARE RECUT -- REPUBLICAN 
FRIENDS, ACCUSING TREVOR SEVEN 
AND HER DEEPLY HELD MEMORIES OF 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER OF A SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN, ARE THE ACCUSING DR. 
FORD OF A SMEAR CAMPAIGN, OF 
ENGAGING IN THE POLITICS OF 
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION?  
BECAUSE THAT IS WHO THEY ARE 
ACTUALLY BLAMING, THEY ARE 
DECRYING HER TESTIMONY, AND 
THEN TRYING TO BLAME DEMOCRATS. 
I DON'T BLAME THEM, THEY HAVE A 
FLAWED NOMINEE, THEY DON'T WANT 
TO FOCUS ON THE NOMINEE.
>>> WHEN FUTURE AMERICANS LOOK 
BACK AT THESE PROCEEDINGS, LET 
THEM DRAW NO LESSONS FROM THE 
SENATE'S CONDUCT HERE. 
LET THEM LOOK BACK ON THIS 
CHAPTER AS THE SHAMEFUL 
CULMINATION OF THE SCORCHED 
EARTH POLITICS PRACTICED BY THE 
HARD RIGHT IN AMERICA. 
PEOPLE WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING 
TO ENTRENCH AN ADVANTAGE ON OUR 
NATIONS COURTS. 
LET THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS 
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH BE RECORDED 
AS A SORRY EPILOGUE TO THE 
BRAZEN THEFT OF JUSTICE 
SCALIA'S SEAT, THE IGNOMINIOUS 
END OF BIPARTISAN COOPERATION 
AND CONSULTATION ON THE 
CONFIRMATION OF SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES. 
AND FOR WHAT? 
FOR WHOM ARE SENATE REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS WILLING TO DISCUSS ALL 
SEMBLANCE -- DISCARD ALL 
SEMBLANCE OF FAIRNESS TO 
CONFIRM? 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, CERTAINLY THE 
PRODUCT OF AN ELITE EDUCATION, 
BUT ALSO SOMEONE WITH HARD 
RIGHT, CONSERVATIVE 
JURISPRUDENCE, FAR AWAY FROM 
WHAT AVERAGE AMERICANS BELIEVE. 
WHY MOST DEMOCRATS OPPOSED HIS 
NOMINATION AT THE OUTSET FEELS 
LIKE ANCIENT HISTORY NOW, BUT 
LET US NOT FORGET THAT MOST 
IMPORTANTLY, WE STRONGLY 
DISAGREED WITH A NUMBER OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S VIEWS, HE IS 
DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF 
UNENUMERATED RIGHTS, INCLUDING 
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE 
FUNDAMENTAL THE PRIVATE 
DECISIONS ABOUT HER MEDICAL 
CARE. 
HE IS DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN PROTECTING 
AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING 
CONDITIONS. 
HE IS DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF NEARLY
ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT 
PROTECT CONSUMERS, WORKERS, AND 
THE ENVIRONMENT. 
AND THE FLASHING RED LIGHT 
WARNING SIGN AT THE CENTER OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S JURISPRUDENCE 
ARE HIS VIEWS ON EXECUTIVE 
POWER AND ACCOUNTABILITY. 
SOMEHOW, THIS CONSERVATIVE 
JUDGE AND SCHOLAR OF THE 
CONSTITUTION, SEES AT THE HEART 
OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY A 
PRESIDENT  KING, AN EXECUTIVE 
WHO WHILE IN OFFICE, SHOULD BE 
BEYOND THE REACH OF SUBPOENAS 
IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS, OR 
CIVIL INVESTIGATIONS. 
THIS MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY 
DEMANDS DEEP SKEPTICISM ABOUT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S VIEW ON 
EXECUTIVE POWER, NOMINATED AS 
HE WAS BY AN EXECUTIVE THAT 
DISDAINS THE CONSTRAINTS OF HIS 
OFFICE, AND WHO IS AT THIS VERY 
MOMENT THE APPARENT SUBJECT OF 
INVESTIGATIONS HIS SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE SHOULD BE INVALID 
-- BELIEVES SHOULD BE 
INVALID.>>> I MET WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS, 
AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THOSE 
ISSUES, HIS ANSWERS WERE 
CONSTANTLY EVASIVE AND UTTERLY 
UNSATISFACTORY. 
IT WAS DCC VU ALL OVER AGAIN 
IN THE FIRST ROUND OF HEARINGS, 
WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED TALKING 
ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON ROE V WADE, 
HEALTHCARE, PRESIDENTIAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND MORE. 
THERE WAS NO LEGAL REASON, A 
RULER LOGIC THAT PREVENTED HIM 
-- RULE OR LOGIC THAT PREVENTED 
HIM FROM TELLING US WHAT HE 
THOUGHT, HE WAS EVASIVE, 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS VIEWS ARE 
DEEPLY AT ODDS WITH THE 
PROGRESS AMERICA HAS MADE OVER 
THE LAST CENTURY OF 
JURISPRUDENCE. 
AND AT ODDS WITH WHAT MOST 
AMERICANS BELIEVE. 
HIS PERFORMANCE WAS NOT ONLY 
UNFAIR AND FRUSTRATING TO THE 
SENATE, IT WAS UNFAIR TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHEN A NOMINEE 
REFUSES TO DISCLOSE THEIR VIEWS,
CHANCES ARE YOU HAVE A NOMINEE 
WHOSE VIEWS ARE FAR OUTSIDE THE 
MAINSTREAM OF AMERICA. 
WEATHER THEY BE FAR RIGHT OR 
FAR LEFT. 
COLLIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE AISLE MAY NOT HAVE AS GREAT 
A CONCERN ABOUT THESE VIEWS AS 
WE DO, BUT LET NO AMERICAN BE 
SURPRISE IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
BECOMES A DECISIVE VOTE TO 
RESTRICT THE RIGHTS AND 
PRIVILEGES OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, WHILE STRETCHING THE 
BOUNDS OF PRIVILEGE FOR THE 
CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION 
ULTIMATELY DOES NOT ONLY 
ENCOMPASS QUESTIONS OF IDEOLOGY 
OR CREDENTIALS, BUT QUESTIONS 
OF CHARACTER. 
HERE AGAIN, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
FALLS WOEFULLY SHORT OF WHAT 
AMERICANS EXPECT AND DESERVE IN 
A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
HE HAS REPEATEDLY MISLED THE 
SENATE ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT IN 
SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS 
CONTROVERSIES OF THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING 
WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING OF 
AMERICAN CITIZENS, OUR POLICY 
AGAINST TORTURE, THE THEFT OF 
RECORDS FROM DEMOCRATIC 
SENATORS, AND HIS INVOLVEMENT 
IN THE NOMINATION OF VERY 
CONTROVERSIAL JUDGES. 
FACED WITH CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS 
OF VARIOUS TYPES OF MISCONDUCT, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CREDIBILITY 
WAS AGAIN TESTED, AND HE 
CONTINUED TO DISSEMBLE AND EVEN 
PREVARICATE ABOUT EASILY 
REFUTED FACTS, BEYOND THE ISSUE 
OF CREDIT BUILDING, HE 
PRESENTED TO THE SENATE THE 
BITTEREST PARTISAN TESTIMONY I 
HAVE EVER HEARD COMING FROM A 
CANDIDATE SEEKING THE SENATE'S 
APPROVAL. 
WHETHER THEY BE FOR THE BENCH, 
OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 
>>> THERE ARE MANY WHO THINK 
THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WAS 17 YEARS OLD 
SHOULD NOT BE DISPOSITIVE. 
EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, HIS 
ACTIONS AT THE AGE OF 53 IN 
TERMS OF DEMEANOR, PARTISANSHIP,
AND ABOVE ALL, CREDIBILITY, 
SHOULD BE DISPOSITIVE. 
JUDGES AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE 
FEDERAL BENCH SHOULD BE HELD TO 
THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF ETHICS 
AND MORAL CHARACTER, JUDGES AT 
EVERY LEVEL SHOULD BE JUDICIOUS 
AND CREDIBLE, AND INDEPENDENT, 
BUT ESPECIALLY, ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
I DO NOT SEE HOW IT IS POSSIBLE 
FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO SAY WITH 
PERFECT CONFIDENCE THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS THE TEMPERAMENT, 
INDEPENDENCE, AND CREDIBILITY 
TO SERVE ON THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT.
>>> SO I ASKED MY COLLEAGUES ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, 
WHY JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 
THERE IS NO DICTATE THAT YOU 
HAVE TO MARCH BLINDLY FORWARD 
WITH A NOMINEE, WHEN THERE ARE 
OTHERS AVAILABLE TO YOU. 
THERE ARE MANY JUDGES WHO I AM 
SURE CONSERVATIVES WOULD BE 
HAPPY TO HAVE ON THE COURT. 
I WOULD REMIND MY COLLEAGUES, 
THE SEAT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
ASPIRES TO FILL WAS HELD BY 
JUSTICE WHO ASSUMED THE BENCH 
AFTER ONE NOMINEE WAS VOTED 
DOWN BY THE SENATE, AND A 
SECOND NOMINEE WITHDREW HIS 
NOMINATION. 
BUT THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY HAS 
PRESSED FORWARD BLINDLY ON 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, EVEN WHEN 
BRAVE WOMEN CAME FORWARD TO 
SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. 
WHY? 
FOR WHAT CAUSE? 
FOR THE SAKE OF WINNING? 
THAT IS NOT REASON ENOUGH. 
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE,
IF YOU HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S CREDIBILITY, ABOUT 
HIS ABILITY TO TELL THE TRUTH, 
ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO BE 
IMPARTIAL AND NONPARTISAN, NO 
MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OF HIS 
JURISPRUDENCE, OR WHAT HE MAY 
OR MAY NOT OF DONE IN HIGH 
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, YOU SHOULD 
NOT VOTE TO CONFIRM HIM TO THE 
SUPREME COURT.
>>> SO MY FRIENDS, DEMOCRAT AND 
REPUBLICAN, FOR ALL THE 
CONTROVERSY, ALL THE HEAVY HAD 
MRS. -- HEAVY HANDEDNESS, THE 
VILIFICATION OF BOTH SIDES, 
THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE THAT THE 
SENATE CAN SAVE ITSELF. 
WE CAN SALVAGE SOME DECENCY 
HERE AT THE END. IF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS REJECTED, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SELECT 
ANOTHER NOMINEE, LIKELY RIGHT 
OF CENTER, PROBABLY NOT TO MY 
LIKING, BUT WITHOUT THE CLOUD 
THAT HANGS OVER THIS NOMINEE. 
AND WE CAN PROCEED TO CONSIDER 
THAT NOMINEE IN A MUCH LESS 
BITTER, MUCH BETTER, LESS 
PARTISAN WAY. 
A BIPARTISAN MAJORITY OF 
SENATORS CONSIDERING FULLY THE 
WEIGHT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
TESTIMONY, RECORD, CREDIBILITY, 
TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND 
TEMPERAMENT, CONSIDERING FULLY 
THE HEARTBREAKING TESTIMONY OF 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, CAN VOTE 
TO REJECT  JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION AND ASKED THE 
PRESIDENT TO SEND THE SENATE 
ANOTHER NAME. 
FOR THE SAKE OF THE SENATE, OF 
THE SUPREME COURT, AND OF 
AMERICA, I HOPE, I PRAY, MY 
COLLEAGUES WILL DO SO. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, WE'VE BEEN 
LISTENING TO CHUCK SCHUMER, 
BEFORE HIM DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 
AND BEFORE THAT, CHUCK GRASSLEY,
SENATORS REITERATING THEIR 
ARGUMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING OUT IN THE HALLWAY, IN 
SCRUMS WITH JOURNALISTS, ABOUT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, BUT WHAT IS 
INTERESTING, IS THERE DESK THEY 
ARE GOING BACK TO THE MACHINE. 
MAYBE WE WON'T, WE WILL LISTEN 
TO WHAT MITCH McCONNELL HAS TO 
SAY.
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A NOMINEE 
OF THE VERY HIGHEST CALIBER. 
A BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND, AN 
ACCOMPLISHED JURIST, WITH A 
PROVEN DEVOTION TO THE RULE OF 
LAW. 
TODAY, THE SENATE HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE HIS 
NOMINATION, EVERY ONE OF US 
WILL GO ON RECORD WITH ONE OF 
THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL VOTES 
YOU EVER CAST IN THE SENATE.
>>> NOW, THE STAKES ARE ALWAYS 
HIGH FOR A SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATION, BUT COLLEAGUES, THE 
EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS OF RECENT 
WEEKS HAVE RAISED AN EVEN 
HIGHER STICK THIS TIME. 
WHEN WE VOTE THIS MORNING, WE 
WILL NOT ONLY BE DECIDING 
WHETHER TO ELEVATE A STUNNINGLY 
WELL-QUALIFIED JUDGE SURE 
HIGHEST COURT, NOT ANYMORE, NOT 
AFTER ALL THIS. 
UNITED STATES SENATE WILL ALSO 
BE MAKING A STATEMENT. 
WITH PARTISAN POLITICS, CAN IT 
OVERRIDE, OR REAFFIRM THAT THE 
NICETIES OF AMERICA, EVERYONE 
IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
WE WILL EITHER STATE THAT FACTS 
AND EVIDENCE CAN SIMPLY BE 
BRUSHED ASIDE WHEN POLITICALLY 
INCONVENIENT, AND SIGNAL THAT 
MEDIA BULLYING AND MOB 
INTIMIDATION ARE VALID TACTICS 
FOR SHAPING THE SENATE. 
THE MOB CAN ATTACK, AND THE 
SENATE CAVES. 
OR WE WILL STAND UP AND SAY 
THAT SERIOUS, THOUGHTFUL, FACT-
BASED DELIBERATION WILL STILL 
DEFINE THIS BODY. 
WE WILL GIVE NOTICE, THAT 
TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED 
ALLEGATIONS ARE NOW OFFICIALLY 
ENOUGH TO DESTROY AN AMERICAN'S 
LIFE. 
OR WE WILL DECLARE THAT OUR 
SOCIETY CANNOT AND MUST NOT, 
WILL NOT, SET THE BAR SO LOW.
>>> SO MADAM PRESIDENT, TODAY 
IS A PIVOTAL DAY IN THE 
NOMINATION PROCESS OF THIS 
EXCELLENT JUDGE. 
BUT IT IS A PIVOTAL DAY FOR US 
HERE IN THE SENATE AS WELL. 
THE IDEALS OF JUSTICE THAT HAVE 
SERVED OUR NATION SO WELL FOR 
SO LONG, ARE ON FULL DISPLAY.
>>> SO LET'S STEP BACK AND 
SAMPLE A FEW OF THE CHOICE 
MOMENTS THAT THE SENATE AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
TREATED TO DURING THE 
ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL SPECTACLE
OF THE LAST TWO WEEKS. 
THE VERY NIGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
WAS ANNOUNCED AS THE PRESENCE 
CHOICE, WE HEARD THE JUNIOR 
SENATOR FROM OREGON SAY THAT 
THIS NOMINEE WOULD PAVE THE WAY 
TO TYRANNY. 
HIS AUDIENCE? 
CROWDS OF FAR LEFT PROTESTERS, 
STILL FILLING IN THE BLANKS ON 
THE PICKET SIGNS, THEY WEREN'T 
SURE WHO THE NOMINEE WAS GOING 
TO BE AT. 
-- BE YET. 
THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY, 
DESCRIBING IT AS A GREAT MORAL 
STRUGGLE. 
IN WHICH THERE ARE JUST 2 CAMPS.
YOU ARE EITHER COMPLICIT IN THE 
EVIL, OR YOU ARE FIGHTING 
AGAINST IT. 
MORE RECENTLY, WE'VE HEARD THE 
JUNIOR SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
ARGUE THAT HER PERSONAL 
DISAGREEMENT WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY 
MEANT, LISTEN TO THIS, HE 
DESERVED LESS OF A PRESUMPTION 
OF INNOCENCE WHEN IT CAME TO 
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. 
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH HER, YOU 
ARE NOT ENTITLED TO THE 
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE WHEN 
IT COMES TO ALLEGATIONS OF 
MISCONDUCT. 
THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? 
THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF DUE 
PROCESS? 
APPARENTLY, YOU GET DUE PROCESS 
ONLY IF YOU AGREE WITH HER. 
AND EVEN MORE RECENTLY, WE SAW 
THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM RHODE 
ISLAND HOLD FORTH WITH GREAT 
CONFIDENCE, OFFERING HIS EXPERT 
INTERPRETATIONS OF GOOFY JOKES 
AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS FROM 
THE EARLY 1980S. 
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY 
ENLIGHTENING. 
INNOCENT JOKES, BEER DRINKING 
REFERENCES, OH NO, OUR 
COLLEAGUE WAS QUITE POSITIVE 
THAT THERE MUST BE A HIDDEN OR 
SINISTER MEANING AT PLAY. 
UNTIL OF COURSE A NUMBER OF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CLASSMATES 
SET HIM STRAIGHT EARLIER THIS 
WEEK.
>>> SO STOP AND CONSIDER THESE 
SNAPSHOTS, THE ABSURDITY, THE 
INDIGNITY, THIS IS OUR APPROACH 
TO CONFIRMING A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE? 
THIS IS THE SENATE'S 
CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC DISCOURSE
? BEFORE THE INK HAD DRIED ON 
JUSTICE KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT, 
OUR OPPONENTS SAID WITH THIS 
WOULD BE ABOUT, DELAY, 
OBSTRUCT,RESIST, BEFORE THE 
INK DRIED, ON THE NOMINATION, 
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, WERE 
RACING TO ANNOUNCE THEY HAD 
MADE UP THEIR MINDS AND TOTALLY 
OPPOSED TO HIS CONFIRMATION. 
MERE HOURS AFTER JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WAS NOMINATED, MY 
FRIEND, THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER, 
SAID I WILL OPPOSE THEM WITH 
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT, HOURS 
BEFORE HE WAS NOMINATED, IT WAS 
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HIS 
NUMBER 1 GOAL WAS TO DEFEAT THE 
NOMINATION BY ANY MEANS 
NECESSARY. 
IT WAS RIGHT THERE FROM THE 
BEGINNING, MADAM PRESIDENT, A 
CLEAR DECLARATION, PLAIN AS DAY,
NOTHING COULD GET MOST DEMOCRATS
TO CONSIDER THIS NOMINEE WITH 
AN OPEN MIND. 
IT WOULD BE DELAYED ATTACK IS --
TACTICS, OBSTRUCTION AND SO-
CALLED RESISTANCE UNTIL THE 
FINAL VOTE WAS CALLED.
>>> FOR A FEW WEEKS, THEIR 
EFFORTS PLAYED OUT ALONG LINES 
THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BECOME 
SOMEWHAT ORDINARY AROUND HERE, 
EXCUSES FOR DELAY, THOSE FELL 
FLAT, THERE WERE GROSS 
DISTORTIONS OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S RECORD THAT WERE 
BATTED DOWN BY OUTSIDE FACT 
CHECKERS, AND THE USUAL PHONY 
APOCALYPTIC PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT 
ARE SHOUTED WHENEVER A 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT THERE IS TO
NOMINATE A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE, HAPPENS EVERY TIME. 
HOSTILE TO WOMEN, VULNERABLE 
PEOPLE, WORKERS, SAME OLD 
TRICKS, SAME OLD PLAYBOOK. 
HERE WAS THE PROBLEM, THE OLD 
PLAYS WEREN'T WORKING. 
THE DISTORTIONS WERE BEING 
LITERALLY DROWNED OUT BY THE 
FACTS. 
SENATORS RECEIVED AND REVIEWED 
MORE PAGES OF BACKGROUND 
MATERIALS ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION THEN FOR EVERY 
PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATION COMBINED. 
WE READ HIS 12 YEAR RECORD OF 
JUDICIAL RULINGS FROM OUR 
NATION'S SECOND HIGHEST COURT, 
300+ OPINIONS. 
WE HEARD SWORN TESTIMONY, 
WRITTEN ACCOUNTS FROM HUNDREDS 
OF CHARACTER WITNESSES, FROM 
ALL STAGES OF HIS LIFE AND 
CAREER. 
AND A PICTURE PAINTED BY THESE 
FACTS, WAS NOTHING LIKE THE 
CARICATURE. 
NOTHING LIKE THE CARICATURE. 
SO IT WAS CLEAR, MADAM 
PRESIDENT, THAT THE OLD TACTICS 
WEREN'T WORKING, WERE GOING TO 
GET THE JOB DONE. 
THE RESISTANCE DEMANDED MORE. 
TRY SOMETHING NEW THEY SAID. 
WELL WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
NEXT. 
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS OF 
THE MOST SENSITIVE, MOST SERIOUS
SORT WERE SHARPENED INTO 
POLITICAL WEAPONS. 
ONE SUCH ALLEGATION SHARED BY 
DR. FORD IN CONFIDENCE WITH THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,  SOMEHOW 
MYSTERIOUSLY FOUND ITS WAY INTO 
THE PRESS. 
WELL, CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY FOCUSED 
ON A SOBER SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH,
COLLECTING TESTIMONY, ORGANIZED 
A NEW HEARING, AND ASKED FOR A 
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S SEVENTH FBI 
INVESTIGATION.
>>> BY ANY FAIR STANDARD, THE 
ACTUAL FACTS, PROVED TO BE 
STRAIGHTFORWARD. 
NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, NONE,
NONE. 
WAS PRODUCED TO SUPPORT ANY OF 
THE ALLEGATIONS LEVELED AGAINST 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
NO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE FROM 
THE FBI INQUIRY, OR FROM 
ANYWHERE ELSE, NOTHING. 
THAT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR OUR 
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES, THE 
FACTS WERE NOT THE POINT, WE 
SORT OF FORGET BY NOW, WHEN THE 
VERY FBI INVESTIGATION FOR 
WHICH THEY WERE CLAMORING 
TURNED UP NO NEW EVIDENCE, THE 
DEMOCRATS MOVED THE GOALPOSTS 
YET AGAIN.
>>> I BELIEVE THE LATEST STORY 
IS THAT THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION 
IS INVALID, BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS 
WHO HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEEN TOLD 
SECOND HAND OR THIRD HAND ABOUT 
NEARLY 40-YEAR-OLD ALLEGATIONS 
WERE NOT TREATED AS ESSENTIAL 
WITNESSES. 
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN, THE 
LATEST STORY IS THAT THE WHOLE 
INVESTIGATION IS INVALID 
BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD 
ONLY RECENTLY BEEN TOLD SECOND 
HAND OR THIRD HAND ABOUT NEARLY 
40-YEAR-OLD ALLEGATIONS WERE 
NOT TREATED AS ESSENTIAL 
WITNESSES. 
NEVERMIND THAT THEY DID NOT 
ACTUALLY WITNESS ANYTHING, THEY 
DID NOT WITNESS ANYTHING.
>>> SO LET'S BE CLEAR, MADAM 
PRESIDENT, THESE ARE NOT 
WITNESSES, THESE ARE PEOPLE 
SUPPOSEDLY IMPOSITION OF HEARSAY
THAT THEY FIRST HEARD 35 YEARS 
AFTER THE SUPPOSED FACT. 
WHAT NONSENSE. 
THE PEOPLE WHOM DR. FORD CLAIM 
WERE WITNESSES, THEY HAVE 
SPOKEN WITH THE FBI.  
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY, 
THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS, PUT UP 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS SAYING SO. 
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS WHAT WE 
KNEW AT THIS TIME A WEEK AGO, 
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO 
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE FOR 
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
THE SAME THING WE HEARD A WEEK 
AGO. 
IF THERE WERE, YOU BET WE 
WOULD'VE HEARD ABOUT IT, BUT 
THERE ISN'T. 
SO NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, MADAM 
PRESIDENT, THE LEAGUE OF DOCTOR 
FORD'S LETTER OPENED THE 
FLOODGATES. 
THE FEEDING FRENZY WAS FULL ON. 
THE WEAPONIZATION OF HER LETTER 
BY THE LEFT LED TO A TORRENT OF 
OTHER EQUALLY UNCORROBORATED 
ALLEGATIONS. 
THEY WERE DUMPED ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY. 
AND BREATHLESSLY, BREATHLESSLY 
THE MEDIA SEIZED ON THEM, THE 
MORE OUTLANDISH, THE BETTER. 
AMERICANS WERE INFORMED THAT HE 
MASTERMINDED VIOLENT DRUG GANGS 
AS A TEENAGER, UNTIL THAT 
ACCUSER WALKED HER STORY BACK. 
WE WERE INFORMED THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH BEAT SOMEONE UP ON A 
BOAT ANY RHODE ISLAND HARBOR, 
UNTIL THAT ACCUSER TOTALLY 
RECANTED. 
WE HEARD ANOTHER TALL TALE OF 
PHYSICAL ASSAULT UNTIL THAT 
ACCOUNT WAS THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED 
BY SITTING FEDERAL JUDGE. 
OH AND YES, WE WERE INFORMED 
THAT JUVENILE JOKES IN HIS HIGH 
SCHOOL YEARBOOK WERE ACTUAL 
SINISTER, SECRET REFERENCES, 
ALL THE KEYSTONE COPS WERE ON 
THE CASE. 
KEYSTONE COPS WERE ON THE CASE, 
MADAM PRESIDENT. 
AND SENATE DEMOCRATS CHEERED 
THEM ON. 
THEY READ PARTS OF THIS 
UNCORROBORATED MUDSLIDE INTO THE
SENATE RECORD. 
THEY CITED THEM IN A OFFICIAL 
LETTER DEMANDING THAT HIS 
NOMINATION BE WITHDRAWN. 
WERE THEY TRUE? 
WILL OF COURSE, THAT WAS QUITE 
BESIDE THE POINT. 
QUITE BESIDE THE POINT. 
SO LONG AS THEY WERE CONVENIENT.
EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO ENSURE 
THAT THE FACT FREE VERDICT OF 
THE MOB AND THE MEDIA WOULD WIN 
OUT OVER THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE. 
MAKE SURE THE MOB PREVAILS. 
BUT THE UNCORROBORATED MUD AND 
PARTISAN NOISE, AND PHYSICAL 
INTIMIDATION OF MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE WILL NOT HAVE THE FINAL 
SAY AROUND HERE. 
THE SENATE WILL HAVE THE FINAL 
SAY.
>>> SO MADAM PRESIDENT, WE ARE 
ALMOST AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY,
WITH ANGER AND FEAR, AND PERSON 
SHIP, THE CROSSWINDS HAVE BLOWN 
STRONG THIS PAST WEEK. 
-- PARTISANSHIP. THEY HAVE 
HARMED A GOOD MAN AND HIS 
FAMILY, THEY HAVE TARNISHED THE 
DIGNITY OF THIS INSTITUTION, 
BUT ALL OF IT CAN END TODAY, 
THE TIME HAS COME TO VOTE. 
THE SENATE STANDS ON THE 
THRESHOLD OF A GOLDEN 
OPPORTUNITY, WE HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THE 
NOMINATION OF AN TWO INCREDIBLY 
WILL QUALIFY DID -- WELL-
QUALIFIED JURISTS. 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH ON THE COURT 
WHERE HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICE 
WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY PROUD FOR 
YEARS TO COME. 
BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
DO EVEN MORE. 
TODAY, WE CAN SEND A MESSAGE TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT SOME 
CORE PRINCIPLES REMAIN 
UNFETTERED BY THE PARTISAN 
PASSIONS OF THIS MOMENT. 
FACTS MATTER. 
FAIRNESS MATTERS. 
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS 
SACROSANCT. 
THE SENATE HAS TURNED OF -- 
IT'S BACK ON THESE THINGS 
BEFORE, BUT NEVER FOR LONG AND 
WITHOUT DEEP REGRET, THIS 
INSTITUTION DOES NOT LOOK BACK 
PROBABLY ON THE HEIR OF JOSEPH 
McCARTHY, OR THE OTHER TIMES 
WHEN THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL 
DESTRUCTION POISONED ITS 
JUDGMENT. 
NO, THE SENATE LOOKS BACK ON 
THOSE THINGS WITH SHAME. 
AND WITH A CONVICTION THAT WE 
CANNOT GO DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN. 
WE KNOW THE SENATE IS BETTER 
THAN THIS, WE KNOW THE NATION 
DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS, BY 
CONFIRMING JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH
TO THE SUPREME COURT, THIS 
BRILLIANT JURORS WILL BE 
CHARGED WITH UPHOLDING THE RULE 
OF LAW AND AMERICAN JUSTICE, WE 
MUST HOLD OURSELVES TO THAT 
SAME STANDARD, SEES THE GOLDEN 
OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US TODAY TO 
CONFIRM A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
WHO WILL MAKE US PROUD. 
AND TO REAFFIRM OUR OWN 
COMMITMENT TO THE JUSTICE THAT 
EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN DESERVES.
>>> AS A REMINDER TO OUR GUESTS 
IN THE GALLERY, EXPRESSIONS OF 
APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL ARE NOT 
PERMITTED IN THE GALLERIES. 
THE CLERK WILL APPROVE THE 
MOTION FOR CLOTURE.

>> AYE. 
>> MR. SANDERS?
>> MR. SAASE? 
>> AYE. 
>> ESTHER SCHUMER? 
-- MR. SCHUMER?
>> YES. 
-- NO.
>> MR. SHALL BE? 
-- SHELBY?
>>> JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF 
WHAT WE ARE LISTENING TO RIGHT 
NOW, THIS IS NOT A VOTE ON 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, THIS IS THE 
VOTE TO VOTE, ESSENTIALLY, DO 
WE WANT TO MOVE TO CLOTURE, AND 
WHAT IS VERY INTERESTING IS WE 
ARE TRYING TO LISTEN TO WHAT 
CERTAIN HE SENATORS HAVE TO SAY,
WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK THIS 
PROCESS SHOULD MOVE FORWARD, 
THE INDICATION IS, IF THEY 
THINK THEY SHOULD MOVE -- IT 
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD, THEN THEY 
ARE IN SUPPORT OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO 
LISTEN TO HOW THE SENATORS ARE 
VOTING, AND WHAT WHAT WE HAVE 
DISCOVERED IS THAT SOME 
SENATORS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO SAY 
ANYTHING AT ALL. 
>> WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS 
WEEK I KNOW SENATOR WANTS TO BE 
THE ONLY ONE VOTING YES OR NO, 
NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE DEFINING 
VOTE, WE ARE LISTENING REALLY 
CAREFULLY TO HEAR SOME OF THESE 
FOLKS, WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON 
LISA MURKOWSKI AND JOE MANSION 
-- MANCHIN. 
>> AND SOMEONE SAID SHE DIDN'T 
CAST A VOTE, BUT I AM SEEING ON 
TWITTER THAT SHE DID SAY NO.>> 
SOME SAID SHE SAID NO QUIETLY, 
WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
WHAT EXACTLY THAT WAS, THAT IS 
SIGNIFICANT. 
TO SAY THE LEAST. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A CLOTURE 
VOTE, TO HELP OUR AUDIENCE 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS, THIS 
IS VOTING TO ADVANCE THE BILL, 
IF YOU ARE VOTING NO, THAT IS 
SIGNIFICANT, SUSAN COLLINS DID 
VOTE YES TO ADVANCE FORWARD, 
BUT SHE SAID SHE WILL MAKE HER 
FINAL DECISION AT 3 PM TODAY, 
THAT GIVES AN INDICATION OF 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL VOTE TO 
ADVANCE SOMETHING AND THEN VOTE 
AGAINST IT LATER, THAT IS VERY 
RARE, BUT IN THIS DAY AND AGE, 
I SHOULD SAY, IT IS 
SIGNIFICANT, IF MURKOWSKI CITY 
CLEAR NO, THAT WOULD BE ONE 
LESS PERSON.
>>> 538.COM, THE NATE SILVER 
BLOG HAS SOMETHING INTERESTING 
TO SHARE WITH OUR VIEWERS, 
THEIR PERCENTAGE OF THE 
SENATORS ON THE BUBBLE THAT 
THEY VOTE WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S PREFERENCES, SENATOR BEN
SAASE, 87% OF THE TIME, JEFF 
FLAKE, 84%, AND JOE MANSION, 
51%, -- MANCHIN.
>>  THAT IS WHY WE ARE FOCUSED 
ON JOE MANCHIN,  HE IS UP FOR 
REELECTION IN A STATE THAT IS 
GETTING AS RED AS IT CAN 
POSSIBLY GET, A STATE THAT 
TRUMP WON BY BIG NUMBERS, AND 
THE OTHER REPUBLICAN IS RUNNING 
AS AN ALLY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
HOPING HE CAN ABSORB EVERYTHING 
THAT TRUMP CAN GIVE, THAT'S WHY 
WE ARE FOCUSED SO OFTEN ON JOE 
MANCHIN, HE HAS CROSSED  THE 
AISLE, HE VOTED FOR NEIL 
GORSUCH'S, AND OTHER POSITIONS, 
WE ARE FOCUSED ON HIM, 
ESPECIALLY SINCE LISA MURKOWSKI 
VOTING NO MEANS THAT THEY NEED 
ANOTHER VOTE, AND MIKE PENCE IS 
STAYING IN WASHINGTON TO 
PERHAPS BE A TIEBREAKER IF 
NEEDED. 
IF LISA MURKOWSKI IS A NO, I AM 
WONDERING WHAT THAT MEANS FOR 
JOE MANCHIN, TWO IS A LOOK AT 
IT, YOU COULD SAY THAT HE COULD 
BE THE REPLACEMENT FOR,  OR 
SOMEONE LIKE MURKOWSKI COULD BE 
GIVING COVER TO JOE MANCHIN , 
SO HE CAN GO HOME AND SAY I 
WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.
>> HOW MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION 
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH VERSUS 
TAKING THE TEMPERATURE IN THEIR 
HOME STATES AND FIGURING OUT IF 
THEY PAY THE PRICE FOR THE WAY 
THEY VOTE? 
>> I WAS TALKING TO JOE 
MANCHIN'S OFFICE YESTERDAY,  
THEY ARE SAYING THEIR PHONE 
LINES ARE OVERLOADED, THEY HAVE 
BEEN GETTING TONS AND TONS OF 
CALLS, I SAID TO THEY ARE 
COMING FROM, THEY SAID ALL OVER 
THE SPECTRUM, KIND OF DIVIDED, 
AND HE WAS MEETING WITH VICTIMS 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN HIS 
OFFICE, AS WAS MURKOWSKI, ALL 
OF THIS LOBBYING GOING ON 
BEHIND THE SCENES, AND LAST-
MINUTE EFFORTS TO FIGURE THIS 
OUT. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT IS 
PLAYING OUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE 
U.S. SENATE? 
>> WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS 
HOW HAVE THESE PEOPLE REACTED 
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S OP-ED, 
WHERE HE WAS APOLOGETIC ABOUT 
HIS BEHAVIOR DURING THE HEARING?
I THINK THAT GIVES THE SENATORS 
WHO ARE ON THE FENCE A LOT OF 
COVER, BUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO 
LOOK AT AND SEE IS EXACTLY 
WHERE YOU WERE, JOE MANCHIN, I 
HAVE MET HIM IN THE PAST,  MY 
HUSBAND HAS KNOWN HIM IN THE 
PAST, HE IS A PERSON OF GREAT 
CONSCIENCE, AND THIS HAS TO BE 
A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR 
HIM, THAT HE STAYS WITH HIS 
PARTY, OR GOES WITH THIS DATE? 
WHAT IS HIS ROLE, AS A SENATOR, 
DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN, TO 
REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE OF THE STATE HE 
REPRESENTS, THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE AS A RED STATE, TO WANT 
TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH DESPITE 
THE FACT THAT HE IS A DEMOCRAT. 
I THINK HE IS IN THE MOST 
CHALLENGING POSITION OF ALL.
>> HE IS IN A REALLY DIFFICULT 
POSITION, I WAS TALKING TO 
REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS WHO HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE 
CAMPAIGNS, AND HE SAID THAT IF 
JOE MANCHIN  VOTES FOR 
KAVANAUGH, THE RAISES IN HIS 
FAVOR, IF HE VOTES AGAINST HIM, 
HE THINKS THE RACES OVER. 
SO JOE MANCHIN HAS CARVED OUT, 
AS RICKY SAID, AN IDENTITY FOR 
HIMSELF IN WEST VIRGINIA,  BUT 
WE ARE ANYTIME NOW WHERE 
POLITICS HAS BECOME VERY TRIBAL,
HE IS THE LAST DEMOCRAT 
STANDING IN WEST VIRGINIA AT A 
FEDERAL AND LOCAL LEVEL IN 
TERMS OF PUBLIC OFFICE, SO HIM 
VOTING YES ON THIS IS 
IMPORTANT, AND IF HE DOES IN 
FACT CONTINUE TO VOTE YES ON 
THE FINAL VOTE, THAT GIVES 
KAVANAUGH SOME BIPARTISAN 
CONFIRMATION. 
>> IT DOES APPEAR --
>> BY A THREAD.
>> WE ARE TRYING TO LISTEN TO 
THE VOTE ON THE FLOOR, WE HAVE 
REPORTERS OBVIOUSLY ON THE 
FLOOR OF THE SENATE, AND IT 
DOES LOOK LIKE SENATOR MURKOWSKI
VOTED NO ON THE PROCEDURAL VOTE 
TO ADVANCE JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT 
SENATOR FLAKE, JOE MANCHIN , 
AND COLLINS, CAN WE CONFIRM 
THAT THEY VOTED YES?
>> THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THAT.
>> I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT 
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE VOTES YES 
OR NO, ON THE PROCEDURAL VOTE 
DOES NOT MEAN THAT IS THEIR 
VOTE FINALLY, THE GREAT EXAMPLE 
IS JOHN McCAIN, DEALING WITH 
THE HEALTHCARE BILL, HE VOTED 
YES ON THE CLOTURE VOTE, AND 
THEN NO ULTIMATELY ON THE 
HEALTHCARE BILL. 
THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN, WE 
APPRECIATE IT, I KNOW YOU ARE 
GETTING ON A FLIGHT.>> THANK 
YOU . 
>>> AS WE TRY TO NAIL DOWN HOW 
THESE FOLKS OF VOTED, WE HAVE 
BEEN SAYING TO OUR AUDIENCE, 
THIS IS NOT THE VOTE, THIS IS 
JUST THE VOTE FOR CLOTURE, BUT 
IT DOES HISTORICALLY GIVE 
INSIGHT INTO HOW SOME OF THE 
SENATORS MIGHT POSSIBLY VOTE 
TOMORROW. 
>> THAT IS WHY MURKOWSKI IS 
SIGNIFICANT.
>> CONFIRMED, SENATORS JEFF 
FLAKE, COLLINS, AND JOE MANCHIN 
VOTED YES, AND  SENATOR 
MURKOWSKI CASTED A NO VOTE. 
>> SHE IS CONSIDERED A MORE 
MODERATE REPUBLICAN, OFTEN A 
SWING VOTE ON A FEW THINGS, SHE 
HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS VOTE 
BEYOND BRETT KAVANAUGH, ENGAGED 
IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ME 
TOO MOVEMENT, WHAT THIS MEANS 
IN TERMS OF BELIEVING WOMEN WITH
ACCUSATIONS, SHE HAS ENGAGED 
THE DEBATE. 
SECOND, THE GOVERNOR OF THE 
STATE OPPOSES BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
A LOT OF RESISTANCE TO 
KAVANAUGH. 
THEY BELIEVE SOME OF HIS 
RULINGS ON TRIBAL ISSUES ARE 
VERY PROBLEMATIC, HER VOTING NO 
TO ADVANCE THE BILL LIKE MEAN 
SHE IS VOTING NO ON FINAL 
PASSAGE.
>> WHAT IS THE STRATEGY BEHIND 
SUSAN COLLINS VOTING TO 
PROCEED, THEN SAYING TO THE 
WORLD IN PUBLIC THAT SHE WILL 
ANNOUNCE HER FINAL VOTE AT 3 PM 
TODAY? 
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY? 
>> A VOTE FOR CLOTURE IS A VOTE 
TO OPEN UP DEBATE FOR THE 
FLOOR, GIVEN HOW THE POLITICS 
IS, PEOPLE VOTE THE SAME WAY ON 
CLOTURE AND FINAL PASSAGE. 
BUT I'M WONDERING IF EITHER 
SUSAN COLLINS IS JUST VOTING TO 
OPEN UP THE DEBATE, AND ONCE TO 
TAKE TIME TO START TO EXPLAIN 
WHAT SHE IS GOING TO DO AT 3 PM,
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SHE 
WILL EXPLAIN WHAT HER FINAL 
VOTE WILL BE, THAT COULD BE 
THAT SHE COULD COME OUT AND SAY 
THIS IS THE REASON WHY I AM 
VOTING FOR HIM, AND I WANT TO 
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 
THAT EVERYBODY, OR IT COULD BE 
SOMETHING ELSE HERE. 
>> IS A BECAUSE SHE IS STILL -- 
I KNOW WE ARE ASKING TO 
SPECULATE ON WHAT SHE IS 
THINKING, IS SHE REALLY STILL 
ON THE FENCE? 
>> WHAT IS INTERESTING TO 
CONSIDER ABOUT COLLINS COMPARED 
TO MURKOWSKI, IS THAT COLLINS 
IS TALKED VERY FAVORABLY ABOUT 
THEM IN THE PAST, ROE V WADE 
HAS BEEN A KEY STICKING POINT 
FOR DEMOCRATS AND MORE MODERATE 
REPUBLICANS LIKE COLLINS AND 
MURKOWSKI, AND COLLINS HAS SAID 
AFTER MEETING WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH BEFORE THESE 
ALLEGATIONS CAME OUT, SHE WAS 
CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD NOT 
VOTE TO OVERTURN ROE V WADE AND 
CONFIDENT IN HIS EXPERIENCE. 
SHE HAS BEEN LOOKING, IN THE 
WAY SHE HAS BEEN APPROACHING 
IT, A LOT OF THEM WANT TO VOTE 
YES ON A JUDICIAL NOMINEE, FOR 
REPUBLICANS, THIS IS AN 
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE IN TERMS 
OF ELECTIONS, SOMETHING THAT HAS
BEEN TRADITIONALLY CRITICAL FOR 
REPUBLICANS, THEY SEE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE THE COURT 
DIFFERENTLY THAN DEMOCRATS, 
THAT MIGHT CHANGE THE MIDTERMS, 
BUT SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN 
TALKING IN WAYS THAT SUGGESTS 
SHE WANTS TO GET TO YES. 
THE FBI REPORT CAME OUT 
YESTERDAY, THERE IS AN ARGUMENT 
THAT GAVE SOME POLITICAL COVER.
>> HERE'S THE BREAKDOWN OF HOW 
THE SENATORS HAVE VOTED, THE 
NOMINATION ADVANCES TO THE 
FINAL FLOOR VOTE, BECAUSE YOU 
CAN SEE THE YEAS HAVE IT AT 51-
49 NO. 
IT WILL BE SOMETIME TOMORROW 
FOR THE FINAL VOTE. 
>> LAST NIGHT, WE WERE GETTING 
REPORTS THAT STEVE DAINES, A 
REPUBLICAN FROM MONTANA, NEEDS 
TO BE BACK IN MONTANA TO WALK 
HIS DAUGHTER DOWN THE AISLE, HE 
SAID HE NEEDS TO DO THAT, AND 
HE WILL DO THAT, THAT EXPRESSED 
TO US YESTERDAY THAT THERE WAS 
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAD THE 
VOTES.
>> I WANT TO FLAG A TWEET FROM 
SUSAN PAGE, THE USA TODAY 
WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, SHE 
PUT SOMETHING INTERESTING ON 
TWITTER, I WILL QUOTE HER, ONE 
CONSEQUENCE OF JOE MANCHIN 
VOTING YES AND MURKOWSKI VOTING 
NO,  IS THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
WON'T BE THE FIRST SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE CONFIRMED ALONG 
STRICTLY PARTISAN LIES -- LINES.
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THE 
SENATE, OR LAWMAKERS, THAT THIS 
WILL COME DOWN TO PARTY LINES, 
AND IT MAY ULTIMATELY NOT BE 
THAT.
>> RAZOR THIN. 
>> SUPREME COURT NOMINEES USED 
TO BE TRADITIONALLY BIPARTISAN, 
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID I VOTED FOR 
KAGAN AND SOTOMAYOR, THE 
PRESIDENT, HAS THE POWER TO 
CONFIRM A NOMINEE, FOR THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
THIS HAS BEEN CHANGING. 
>> YOU HEARD SOME OF THE 
SENATORS BEFORE THE VOTE TRY TO 
REMIND US WHAT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS WAS, REMIND US THAT THE 
DEBATE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT 
HIS FITNESS AS A JUDGE, HIS 
RECORD, HIS LEGAL EXPERIENCE, 
AND CLEARLY, THEY DIFFER ON 
WHETHER THEY GOT ENOUGH 
INFORMATION. 
BUT REMEMBER WHEN THE BIG 
CONTROVERSY WAS DOCUMENTS FROM 
WHEN HE WORKED FOR THE BUSH 
MINISTRATION, AND WHETHER 
THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS WERE RELEASED, THAT 
SEEMS LIKE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO 
THAT HAPPEN.
>> CAN YOU REPEAT THAT, CONTROL 
ROOM? 
MOLLY HOOPER IS JOINING US ON 
THE PHONE TO TALK ABOUT THIS, 
THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION, NO 
MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT, 
THE WAY YOU ARE LEANING, THE 
WIND IS BLOWING, THIS IS WHAT 
DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE 
JUST WITNESSED? 
>> THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS 
LIKE, EXACTLY, THAT'S ONE OF 
THE CHANCE I'VE HEARD OUTSIDE 
THE SUPREME COURT, REGARDING 
THESE ISSUES. 
YES, THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY 
LOOKS LIKE YOUR WHAT THEY VOTED 
ON TODAY WAS SIMPLY A MOVE TO A 
FINAL VOTE ON THE CONFIRMATION, 
AND JUST BECAUSE SUE IS TASHA 
SUSAN COLLINS VOTED ON THIS, IT 
DOESN'T AND ASSUMING A VOTE ON 
CONFIRMATION, IT PROBABLY WILL 
BE, BUT THIS WAS A PROCEDURAL 
VOTE, THE FACT THAT JOE MANCHIN 
VOTED YES,  IS NOT SOMETHING 
SPECIFIC, IT IS A RULE VOTE, 
THEY CALL IT, THE PEOPLE IN 
POWER, REPUBLICANS VOTE AGAINST 
A RULE IN THE HOUSE, AND THEY 
VOTE IN A PROCEDURAL RULE LIKE 
THIS IN THE SENATE, THAT IS 
ALMOST MORE UPSETTING TO THE 
LEADERSHIP THAN THE FINAL VOTE, 
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, WHAT THE 
LEADERS WANT IS A VOTE ON 
CONFIRMATION REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER IT IS UP OR DOWN, GET A 
VOTE ON THE CONFIRMATION, AND 
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WAS JUST 
MOVING TO THE FINAL VOTE.
>> DO YOU BUY THIS IDEA THAT 
BECAUSE HE GOT AT LEAST ONE 
DEMOCRATIC VOTE, PERHAPS HE CAN 
GO DOWN IN HISTORY, HE WILL BE 
REMEMBERED AS AT LEAST A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT THE 
VOTES WERE NOT ALONG PARTY 
LINES? 
I PERSONALLY FEEL THE WAY THE 
LARGER DEBATE HAS BEEN GOING, 
IT'S GOING TO SEEM LIKE A VERY 
PARTISAN DECISION?
>> I THINK IT WILL. 
AND THE REASON I SAY THIS IS 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT JUSTICES,
OVER THE PAST FEW 
ADMINISTRATIONS, INCLUDING 
SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN, IT WAS 
VERY PARTISAN, UP UNTIL 
CLARENCE THOMAS, THEY WERE 
ESSENTIALLY 99-0, RUTH BADER 
GINSBURG, 97-0, PRETTY MUCH 
UNANIMOUS, THAT IS THE ADVISE 
AND CONSENT RULE, BUT WHEN YOU 
GOT TO CLARENCE THOMAS, AND 
JUSTICES FOLLOWING HIM, THE 
PARTY LINES STARTED BREAKING 
DOWN, AND THE CLOSER THE VOTE 
GETS, THE MORE PARTISAN IT GETS.
SO YES, IT WILL BE HARD TO SEE 
HE WILL BE A FIGURE VOTED ON A 
BIPARTISAN BASIS. 
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU 
HAVE CONFIRMED IT. 
REGARDLESS.>> IT IS CAITLIN, 
WHAT IS INTERESTING TO ME IS 
THAT SUSAN COLLINS OF COURSE 
VOTED YES ON CLOTURE, BUT SHE 
HAS SAID LATER TODAY THAT SHE'S 
GOING TO ANNOUNCE HER DECISION 
ON FINAL PASSAGE AT 3 PM, WHAT 
ARE YOU HEARING? 
DO YOU EXPECT SHE WILL CONTINUE 
THE VOTE, OR DOES SHE CHANGE 
YOUR MIND? 
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE? 
>> AGAIN, SUSAN COLLINS IS ONE 
OF THOSE SENATORS WHO IS GOING 
BACK AND LOOKING AT THESE 
DOCUMENTS, IS STILL CONSIDERING 
WHAT SHE HAS SEEN, AND AS I 
SAID EARLIER, THE REASON WHY I 
BROUGHT UP THE POINT ABOUT THE 
PROCEDURAL MATTERS, WHEN YOU 
VOTE AGAINST CLOTURE, I.E. 
VOTING -- MOVING THE VOTE. WHAT 
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT YOU GET 
NEXT CONGRESS, CHAIRMANSHIPS, 
AND MURKOWSKI VOTING NO TO MOVE 
ON TO A FINAL VOTE, THAT COULD 
HURT HER IN TERMS OF HER ROLE 
IN THE SENATE, HER CHAIRMANSHIP 
OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE 
RESOURCES COMMITTEE, OR 
SENIORITY. 
AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH COLLINS DID 
VOTE FOR CLOTURE, I DO WONDER 
IF SHE IS STILL FIGURING IT 
OUT.>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU, 
I WAS GOING TO SAY IN RESPONSE 
TO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE,
WHICH IS THAT IT IS INTERESTING 
THAT MURKOWSKI VOTES NO, 
BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD ALL ALONG 
THAT SHE HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT 
NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE 
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THE 
GOVERNOR OF HER STATE IS NOT 
SUPPORTIVE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU'VE GOT 
JOE MANCHIN, FACING A TOUGH 
REELECTION BATTLE  IN WEST 
VIRGINIA, HE HAS VOTED YES. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS FINAL 
VOTE WILL BE, BUT IN THIS CASE, 
DOES IT FEEL LIKE MURKOWSKI AND 
EACH SENATOR IS ELECTED BY 
CONSTITUTE FEW INCIDENTS IN 
THEIR STATE. 
IF THEIR STATE DOESN'T WANT 
THEM TO VOTE A CERTAIN WAY AND 
THE SENATOR VOTES THE OPPOSITE, 
THEY MAY GET OUSTED. 
YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR STATE 
THAT WANT YOU TO VOTE A CERTAIN 
WAY. 
THEY WILL REELECT SOMEBODY 
ELSE. 
SO, BOTH SENATORS ARE LOOKING 
AND LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE IN 
THEIR STATE AND KAITLYN'S 
POINT, THE NATIVE ALASKAN 
POPULATION IS A HUGE 
CONSTITUENCY OF MURKOWSKI. 
SHE RAN AS A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE 
I BELIEVE IN 2010 OR EARLIER 
AGAINST JOE MILLER WHO WON THE 
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AT THE 
TIME. 
A LARGE BASE OF HER SUPPORT WAS 
THE NATIVE ALASKAN POPULATION. 
THEY ARE AGAINST BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME DURING 
THE HEARING, DIDN'T BRING UP 
THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
ALLEGATIONS BUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S E-MAILS AND 
WRITINGS REGARDING THE NATIVE 
HAWAIIAN POPULATION THAT COULD 
INDICATE HOW HE FEELS ABOUT 
SELF GOVERNANCE FOR NATIVE 
POPULATIONS IN GENERAL. 
IT WAS POINTED AT LISA 
MURKOWSKI. 
SHE ANSWERS TO HER NATIVE 
ALASKAN POPULATION. 
THEY WILL BE THE ONES THAT GET 
OUT AND VOTE FOR HER NEXT 
ELECTION. 
SO, YES, I THINK SHE IS 
LISTENING TO HER CONSTITUENTS. 
>> I THINK JUST GOING OFF OF 
THAT, WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT 
THIS PARTICULAR FIGHT, MOLLIE 
MENTIONED TRADITIONALLY SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES BE JOY A 
BIPARTISAN VOTE. 
NEIL GORSUCH GOT THREE 
DEMOCRATS IN MUNITION, HEITKAMP 
AND DONNELLY. 
WE HAVE TO SAY THE PRESIDENT 
HAS BEEN FRAMING THIS IN 
STRICTLY POLITICAL TERMS. 
HE HAS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL ALL WEEK VISITING DEEP 
RED STATES WHERE HE IS VERY 
POPULAR. 
THE FEEDBACK HE IS GETTING AND 
WHAT HE HAS BEEN TELLING HIS 
SUPPORTERS IS THAT A VOTE 
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A 
VOTE AGAINST TRUMP AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND THE AGENDA 
AND WHAT YOU THE TRUMP VOTER 
SUPPORTED. 
THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT 
HAS GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS AND 
THE SUPREME COURT BATTLE HAS 
THE POTENTIAL -- WE SAW IT IN 
2016 AND WE ARE SEEING IT NOW 
TO COALESCE THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY AROUND DONALD TRUMP EVEN 
AFTER THEY VIEW MANY THINGS 
THAT HE HAS DONE AS UNFAVORABLE 
OR THEY TAKE ISSUE WITH HIS 
RHETORIC, THE SUPREME COURT 
FIGHTS, THE JUDICIAL 
NOMINATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THEM. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SEIZED ON 
THAT. 
NOW, YOU CAN ARGUE THAT CAN 
THEY SUSTAIN THAT THE NEXT 
MONTH OR SO? 
AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS POINT IN 
TIME ON THIS PARTICULAR VOTE 
IT'S CLEAR THAT REPUBLICANS 
WERE UNITED WITH THE EXCEPTION 
OF MURKOWSKI AROUND THIS 
NOMINEE. 
>> WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE 
PRESIDENT, AT SOME OF HIS 
RALLIES, HE HAS A NARRATIVE 
THAT HE IS PUSHING THAT EVEN IF 
THEY GET THE SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE THAT THEY WANT, YOU 
SHOULD BE ANGRY BECAUSE THEY 
NEVER SHOULD HAVE PUT THIS GOOD 
MAN THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS. 
PAULA REID IS STANDING BY. 
WE ARE HEARING FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE NOW ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL 
ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GOING. 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TELL ME 
THEY ARE CONFIDENT CALLING THE 
PROCEDURAL VOTE THAT THEY CAN 
GET ENOUGH VOTES TO CONFIRM 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THEY ARE NOT TAKING ANYTHING 
FOR GRANTED. 
THEY ARE STILL PURSUING SOME 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS. 
JOE DONNELLY OF INDIANA, EVEN 
THOUGH HE SAID HE MAY VOTE NO, 
THEY ARE PURSUING HIM. 
THEY ARE TRYING TO FLIP ANYONE 
THEY CAN, WORKING THE PHONES TO 
GET JUDGE KAVANAUGH ACROSS THE 
FINISH LINE. 
WE ARE TOLD THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE BELIEVES JOE MANCHIN WILL 
END UP ULTIMATELY VOTING FOR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS A SHORT 
TIME AGO. 
HE SAID HE WAS STILL UNDECIDED. 
THE WHITE HOUSE IT IS 
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. 
IN THEIR WORDS CONFIDENT. 
>> WE SAW A TWEET FROM THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
VERY PROUD OF THE U.S. SENATE 
FOR VOTING YES TO ADVANCE THE 
NOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ANNE-MARIE 
POINTED OUT, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN VOCAL AND IT FEELS FOR A 
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THIS 
DISCUSSION AROUND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS MOVED BEYOND THE 
ORIGINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
ALLEGATIONS AND SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT ASSAULT ALLEGATION 
THAT CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD AND 
DEBORAH A MIR REDS MADE AGAINST 
JUDGE CAVE NOW AND NOW IT'S A 
-- KAVANAUGH AND NOW IT'S A 
POLITICAL FOOTBALL WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT CAN FRAME IT AS IF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A MARTYR AND 
A MARTYR TO MEN ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY THAT MIGHT BE FALSELY 
ACCUSED MUCH IN THE SAME WAY 
THAT HE SAYS HE HAS BEEN 
FALSELY ACCUSED WHEN IT COMES 
TO HIMSELF AND THE DOZENS OF 
WOMEN THAT ACCUSED HIM OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 
>> A SYMBOLIC MARTYR FOR THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
THIS IS A RALLYING CALL FOR 
REPUBLICAN VOTERS AHEAD OF THE 
CRITICAL MIDTERMS. 
THE POLLING REFLECTS THATED 
KAVANAUGH ISSUE HELPED THEM 
CLOSE THE ENTHUSIASM GAP AND 
THE PRESIDENT HAS SIZED ON 
THIS. 
ON WEDNESDAY HE TWEETED 
SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING. 
HE NOTED THERE WAS MORE 
ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY FOR THE 
UPCOMING MIDTERMS BECAUSE OF 
WHAT MANY PEOPLE PERCEIVE AS AN 
ATTACK ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THEIR ARGUMENT IS DEMOCRATS 
DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON 
THE A HELP ECONOMICS -- AND 
DON'T LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE 
IS IN COULD HOOTS WITH THE 
PRESS AND BROAD CONSPIRACY 
AGAINST HIS AGENDA AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS BEING PUNISHED. 
HE USED THIS SUCCESSFULLY. 
YESTERDAY MORNING HE TALKED 
ABOUT HOW UNFAIRLY, HARSH THE 
TREATMENT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
HAS BEEN AND IS TALKING ABOUT 
HOW IT'S AN INCREDIBLE UPWARD 
IMPACT ON VOTERS. 
HE IS TRYING TO SEIZE ON THE 
CONTROVERSY. 
THIS HAS NOT GONE THE WAY 
REPUBLICANS HAD EXPECTED OR 
HOPED, THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE 
UPSIDE THAT THIS MAY BE WHAT 
THEY NEED TO HELP THEM IN THE 
MIDTERMS. 
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 
REPUBLICANS, TRYING TO TURN 
DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO GET A 
LARGER MARGIN BUT I'M WONDERING 
IF YOU ARE HEARING ANYTHING 
ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS? 
WE HAVE REPORTING ABOUT DIANE 
FEINSTEIN LEAVING THE SENATE 
CHAMBERS SAYING THIS WAS A 
MISTAKE AND SHE WAS ASKED IF 
SHE WAS CONFIDENT THAT 
DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEAT 
KAVANAUGH. 
SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW. 
I IMAGINE THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
BUSY AS WELL BEHIND THE SCENES. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL 
WORKING ON SOME RED STATE 
DEMOCRATS THAT SAID THEY WILL 
VOTE NO TRYING TO PUSH THEM. 
PARTICULARLY JOE MANCHIN. 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN A 
SITUATION WHERE HE IS THE 
DECIDING VOTE. 
HE DOESN'T WANT THAT STICKING 
TO HIM. 
THEY THINK THEY COULD BE ABLE 
TO FLIP HIM AND GET HIM TO VOTE 
YES. 
SO, ABSOLUTELY. 
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW THIS IS 
GOING TO TURN OUT THE NEXT 24 
OR I GUESS SPECIFICALLY 30 
HOURS. 
WE HAVE UNTIL THIS VOTE BUT 
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE CONFIDENT 
AND WORKING THE PHONES. 
>> KAITLYN I WAS THINKING ABOUT 
THE VOTE AS IT MOVES FORWARD. 
WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING A 
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE, ANOTHER 
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT, PARTICULARLY FOR 
SOME OF THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS 
WHO MIGHT NOT TYPICALLY SUPPORT 
HIM LIKE EVANGELICALS. 
WHAT I HAVE BEEN THINKING, 
THOUGH, IS THAT SHOULD 
KAVANAUGH MAKE IT TO THE 
SUPREME COURT, THAT WOULD BE 
TWO CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES. 
THEN WHAT MOTIVATION DO 
EVANGELICALS HAVE TO CONTINUE 
TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. 
THEY ARE GETTING WHAT THEY 
WANT. 
THEN THERE IS HIS PERSONAL, 
SOME OF HIS BEHAVIOR, NOT 
EXACTLY CHRISTIAN LIKE. 
>> I SPENT LAST WEEK TALKING TO 
VARIOUS EVANGELICAL LEADERS IN 
VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY ABOUT KAVANAUGH. 
WHAT I WAS HEARING MORE OFTEN, 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT WHICH IS CRITICALLY 
IMPORTANT THIS THEM BUT ABOUT 
TWO OTHER THINGS. 
FIRST OF ALL, JUDGESHIPS ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY, WHICH THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATE HAS BEEN KEY 
IN SHAPING. 
THAT IS A KEY ITEM OF INTEREST 
FOR McCONNELL AND WHAT HE WANTS 
HIS LEGACY TO BE AND SECOND 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING 
FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE 
PERSPECTIVE ON VARIOUS 
REGULATIONS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
REGULATIONS AND THINGS LIKE 
THAT. 
THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF 
DECISIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS MADE FROM AN ADMINISTRATION 
STANDPOINT THAT THEY ARE STILL 
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. 
THEN, OF COURSE, THERE IS THE 
POTENTIAL FOR POSSIBLY ANOTHER 
SUPREME COURT OPENING IN THE 
NEXT TWO YEARS. 
>> RIGHT. 
SO, THEY JUST KIND OF LIKE WHAT 
THEY ARE SEEING IS WHAT I AM 
HEARING FROM THEM AND IT'S 
CRITICAL. 
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE THE 
POWER TO GALVANIZE PEOPLE TO 
TURN OUT TO VOTE. 
THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED IT IN 
2016. 
THEY ARE STILL ON HIS SIDE AND 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL TRY 
TO KEEP THAT UP BY SAYING, LOOK 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF DEMOCRATS 
TAKE OVER. 
EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANTED AND 
THAT YOU WORKED FOR AND FOUGHT 
FOR ON THIS NOMINATION COULD BE 
AT STAKE. 
SO, THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING 
THAT THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM 
DONALD TRUMP. 
>> THAT IS INTERESTING. 
>> PAULA, BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, 
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN MINNESOTA 
YESTERDAY AND, YOU KNOW, THERE 
WAS OCCUR USE MOMENT WHEN HE 
WAS SPEAKING TO HIS SUPPORTERS 
AT THIS RALLY WHERE HE BROUGHT 
UP THE NAME OF SENATOR AL 
FRANKEN WHO, AS YOU KNOW, WAS 
ESSENTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE 
SENATE. 
HE RESIGNED HIS POSITION AS A 
SENATOR BECAUSE OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AND THE 
PRESIDENT, IT FELT TO ME, AS IF 
THE PRESIDENT WAS SORT OF 
MOCKING SENATOR FRANKEN NOT 
BECAUSE OF THE WRONGDOING BUT 
BECAUSE HE CHOSE TO BACK DOWN 
AND AS WE KNOW IN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S WORLD YOU NEVER DO 
THAT. 
>> EXACTLY. 
NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE 
ALLEGATIONS BUT HOW HE HANDED 
THEM. 
HE FOLDED TO USE THE 
PRESIDENT'S TERM AND CRITICIZED 
HIM FOR NOT DOING WHAT IS HIS 
TRADITIONAL PLAYBOOK, WHEN YOU 
ARE FACED WITH THESE 
ACCUSATIONS, DENY, DENY, DENY 
AND FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT. 
THAT EXPLAINS SOME OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S COMPOSURE THAT WE 
SAW IN THE HEARING. 
HE SAID I WAS MORE EMOTIONAL 
THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN BUT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE SAW THAT HEARING AS 
FOR AN AUDIENCE OF ONE. 
HE NEEDED TO PROVE TO THE 
PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS WILLING 
TO FIGHT FOR HIS NOMINATION AND 
THE PRESIDENT'S LEGACY AT STAKE 
FOR ANY SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
NOMINEE. 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT TOOK JABS AT SOMEBODY 
WHO TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH 
WHEN FACED WITH THOSE KINDS OF 
ACCUSATIONS. 
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 
EMOTIONAL PRESENTATION BEING 
FOR AN AUDIENCE OF ONE. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS OP-ED 
WHERE HE SORT OF APOLOGIZED FOR 
BEING EMOTIONAL FOR AN AUDIENCE 
OF 100 OR SO. 
>> THE QUESTION IS, THERE WERE 
REPORTS, PAULA, THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS 
SORT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH GOING 
OFF THE RESERVATION ONCE AGAIN. 
>> MANY PEOPLE SEE IT AS A 
CLOSING ARGUMENT. 
PERHAPSWE ARE AT AN AUDIENCE 
OF FOUR CRITICAL VOTES RIGHT 
NOW. 
I THINK YOU SAW HIS TESTIMONY 
BEFORE CONGRESS AS AN OPENING 
ARGUMENT, AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF 
HIMSELF, DEFENDING HIMSELF 
TRYING NOT ONLY IN THE EYES OF 
THE PRESIDENT BUT TRYING TO 
PRESERVE HIS REPUTATION. 
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT, HE 
GOES BACK TO BEING A FEDERAL 
JUDGE. 
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT 
THIS IS ON DR. FORD AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
HE WROTE AN OP-ED, SOBER 
WALKING BACK HOW HE HANDLED IT. 
PERHAPS HE WATCHED "SNL" OVER 
THE WEEKEND AND THOUGHT A LOT 
OF THIS WASN'T MADE UP BY THE 
WRITERS, I ACTUALLY SAID THOSE 
THINGS. 
THIS IS A CLOSING AUDIENCE, NOT 
NECESSARILY BEFORE AN AUDIENCE 
OF ONE. 
THIS TIME IT WAS BEFORE THE 
FOUR CRITICAL VOTES THAT COULD 
HELP HIM GET CONFIRMED TO THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 
>> WHAT PAULA SAID IS THAT HE 
MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY, IF THIS 
DIDN'T WORK OUT HE HAS TO GO TO 
HIS OTHER JOB. 
WE KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT HIS 
LIFE. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE BRINGING A CASE 
IN FRONT OF HIM? 
HOW OFTEN WILL HE HEAR YOU MAY 
HAVE TO RECUSE YOURSELF BECAUSE 
OF SOMETHING WE LEARNED ABOUT 
YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
>> THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT MANY 
ARE MAKING BASED ON HIS 
PERFORMANCE DURING THE HEARING. 
PAULA REID, AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 
THANK YOU. 
WE WILL TALK TO YOU IN A BIT. 
NANCY CORDES IS STANDING BY ON 
THE HILL. 
BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE 
DYNAMICS WE WITNESSED ON THE 
FLOOR OF THE SENATE, WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THIS OP-ED THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WROTE, SOME 
ENTER RED THE OP-ED -- 
INTERPRETED THE OP-ED AS A PLEA 
OR ATTEMPT TO SPEAK TO THE 
SENATORS THAT WERE APPALLED BY 
HIS BEHAVIOR DURING THE 
JUDICIARY HEARING INCLUDING 
SENATORS FLAKE AND PERHAPS 
SENATOR COLLINS. 
>> A RECOGNITION ON HIS PART 
THAT HE NEEDED TO DO SOME 
DAMAGE CONTROL. 
WHAT HAPPENS HE NEEDED TO SEND 
A MESSAGE THAT HE UNDERSTOOD 
HIS TEMPERAMENT IN THAT 
HEARING, WHEN HE SNAPPED AT A 
FEW SENATORS, WHEN HE DESCRIBED 
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM BY 
THE TWO WOMEN AS PART OF SOME 
KIND OF DEMOCRATIC CLINTON LED 
CONSPIRACY OR PERHAPS NOT THE 
TYPE OF COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD 
TYPICALLY EXPECT TO COME FROM 
SOMEONE WHO IS LOOKING TO SIT 
ON THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE 
LAND. 
SO, HE WROTE THAT VERY 
CAREFULLY WORDED OP-ED. 
HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY APOLOGIZE 
FOR THOSE COMMENTS BUT 
ACKNOWLEDGED THEM AND SAID THAT 
PERHAPS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT 
HE SAID CROSSED THE LINE BUT IT 
WAS ALL BECAUSE HE FELT SO 
STRONGLY THAT HE WAS BEING 
STRONGLY ACCUSED AND THAT HE 
WAS THINKING ABOUT HIS FAMILY 
AND HOW THEY MUST FEEL AT THIS 
MOMENT. 
JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN COLLINS, LISA 
MURKOWSKI NEVER CAME OUT AND 
DIRECTLY SAID THAT THEY HAVE 
DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT HIS 
TEMPERAMENT BASED ON THE WAY 
THAT HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN 
THE HEARING. 
IN FACT, JEFF FLAKE SAID ON 60 
MINUTES THAT HE MIGHT FEEL THE 
SAME WAY IF HE FELT HE WAS 
WRONGLY ACCUSED AND WOULD BE 
ANGRY AND UNDERSTOOD WHERE THAT 
PASSION CAME FROM. 
BUT, THIS IS SOMEONE THAT IS 
THINKING NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING 
CONFIRMED BUT THINKING ABOUT 
HIS REPUTATION AS HE MOVES 
TOWARD SITTING ON THE SUPREME 
COURT AND HOW HE WILL BE 
VIEWED. 
HOW MUCH TRUST PEOPLE CAN PLACE 
IN HIS DECISIONS. 
HOW MUCH TRUST PEOPLE CAN HAVE 
IN THE FACT THAT HE WILL BE AN 
IMPARTIAL JURIST. 
IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD ALL OF 
THAT IN MIND WHEN HE WROTE THE 
OP-ED. 
>> NANCY, IT'S KAITLYN. 
WE ARE WATCHING SUSAN COLLINS 
AND LISA MURKOWSKI THE PAST TWO 
WEEKS. 
BOTH VOTED DEFINITELY. 
DO YOU THINK THAT COLLINS HAS 
ANY CHANCE OF VOTING NO ON 
FINAL PASSAGE? 
SHE SAID SHE WILL MAKE AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT AT 3:00 TODAY. 
AND MURKOWSKI, TALK ABOUT WHAT 
IT'S LIKE FOR HER AND WHAT 
FACTORED INTO HER DECISION 
TODAY BEING THE ONLY REPUBLICAN 
TO VOTE NO ON THROW TUR. 
>> IT WAS -- CLOTURE. 
>> I WAS THERE IN THE CHAMBER. 
THEY SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. 
THEIR DESKS ARE NEXT TO ONE 
ANOTHER. 
WHEN MURKOWSKI'S NAME WAS 
CALLED AND SHE SAID NO, SHE 
SAID IT SO SOFTLY THAT AT FIRST 
EVERYONE LEANED OVER AND SAID 
WHAT DID SHE SAY? 
AND IT WAS THEN THAT WE 
REALIZED SHE WAS VOTING NO TO 
ADVANCE THE NOMINATION. 
EVEN AFTER SHE DID THAT, 
COLLINS SITTING NEXT TO HER 
LEANED OVER FROM TIME TO TIME, 
CHATTED WITH HER AS THE REST OF 
THE SENATORS WERE CASTING THEIR 
VOTES. 
MURKOWSKI WAS VERY STRAIGHT 
FACED, SORT OF LOOKING AHEAD, 
NOT REGISTERING MUCH EMOTION 
BUT RIGHT AFTER THE VENTED, 
THIS IS WHAT WAS SO 
FASCINATING. 
TWO REPUBLICANS CAME UP TO HER 
RIGHT AWAY. 
JOHN CORNYN OF TEXAS AND ROB 
PORTMAN OF OHIO, TWO BIG 
SUPPORTERS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
ROB PORTMAN WAS ACTIVELY 
LOBBYING SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES 
ON KAVANAUGH'S BEHALF. 
THEY CAME UP TO HER AND SHOOK 
HER HAND AS IF TO SAY NO HARD 
FEELINGS. 
THEN AFTER THEY MOVED ON, MARIA 
CANTWELL A DEMOCRAT FROM 
WASHINGTON STATE WALKED UP, 
HANDED HER A NOTE AND WALKED 
AWAY. 
TWO OTHER WOMEN, AMY LOBO CHAR 
CAME UP BIG SMILES TO TALK TO 
HER. 
SUSAN COLLINS HAD HER ARM 
AROUND MURKOWSKI'S SHOULDER. 
WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT HOW SUSAN 
COLLINS WILL VOTE IN THE END I 
DON'T KNOW BECAUSE SHE KEPT US 
IN GREAT SUSPENSION. 
SHE WAS CLEARLY SENDING A 
SIGNAL THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS 
WHERE MURKOWSKI IS IN THIS 
DEBATE AND CERTAINLY HAS BEEN 
THERE AT HER SIDE THROUGH SO 
MANY OF THESE TOUGH VOTES AND 
WAS SHOWING HER SUPPORT AGAIN 
TODAY. 
>> NAY SEE, I NOTE THAT IN JOHN 
NOLAN, YOUR PRODUCER'S NOTE TO 
US, THAT WHEN SENATOR MANCHIN 
VOTED YES, THERE WAS A SLIGHT 
GASP IN THE CHAMBER WHEN HE 
VOTED. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT? 
>> THERE WAS. 
THE SENSE WAS IF LISA MURKOWSKI 
WOULD VOTE NO PERHAPS MANCHIN 
WOULD VOTE NO AS WELL. 
HE DID A GREAT JOB OF KEEPING 
EVERYONE IN SUSPENSION. 
WE SPOKE TO HIM A SHORT TIME 
BEFORE THE VOTE. 
HE WAS STILL UNDECIDED. 
WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS 
VOTE HERE JUST TO ADVANCE THE 
NOMINATION WOULD MOST LIKELY 
MIRROR HIS VOTE TOMORROW FOR 
CONFIRMATION. 
THAT IS TYPICALLY HOW HE LIKES 
TO HANDLE THESE THINGS. 
WE DON'T KNOW FORESURE. 
THAT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN -- WE 
DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. 
THAT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN. 
I WILL ADVANCE THE NOMINATION 
AND THAT WILL BUY ME ANOTHER 24 
HOURS TO DECIDE HOW I FEEL. 
HIS AIDES HAVE TWO STATEMENTS 
WRITTEN UP AND THEY ARE WAITING 
TO GET THE WORD FROM HIM ON 
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO BEFORE THEY 
RELEASE ONE STATEMENT OR THE 
OTHER. 
SO, HE CLEARLY HAS GONE BACK 
AND FORTH AND BELIEVES THAT 
THERE ARE STRONG ARGUMENTS TO 
BE MADE ON BOTH SIDES. 
>> SO FASCINATING. 
>> DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE WILL 
SEE DEMOCRATS LIKE DIANE 
FEINSTEIN PICKING UP THE PHONE, 
GOING TO PEOPLE'S OFFICES -- IS 
THIS GOING TO BE COMING DOWN TO 
THE WIRE? 
>> WHEN IT COMES TO JOE MANCHIN 
THINGS ARE TRICKY FOR 
DEMOCRATS. 
AS DICK DURBIN PUT IT THIS 
MORNING, THE TYPICAL PUTTING 
THE SCREWS TO SOMEONE, IT 
DOESN'T QUITE WORK. 
IN FACT, DEMOCRATS LEARNED THE 
HARD WAY IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH 
PRESSURE ON JOE MANCHIN WHO HAS 
AN INDEPENDENT STREAK SOMETIMES 
IT CAN BACK FIRE AND HE CAN GET 
FRUSTRATED AND GOT OTHER WAY. 
THEY HAVE TAKEN A HANDS OFF 
APPROACH. 
HEY REALIZE THAT HE IS  
-- HE IS REALLY WEIGHING HIS 
OPTIONS AND SHIFTING THROUGH 
BOTH THE POLITICAL ARGUMENTS, 
THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT, ABOUT KAVANAUGH HIMSELF, 
THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT ALLEGATION AND THAT IT 
REALLY WON'T DO THEM MUCH GOOD 
TO TRY TO FORCE HIM OFF THE 
FENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NO 
MATTER HOW BADLY THEY WOULD 
LIKE TO KNOW WHERE HE STANDS. 
>> WE CAN REMEMBER THAT 
PHOTOGRAPH SNAPPED BY THE 
CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER FROM CBS 
NEWS, IS THE PICTURE OF SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN WITH HER ARM THERE 
TALKING TO SENATOR MURKOWSKI. 
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT 
WAS BEING SAID. 
>> RIGHT. 
WE KNOW HOW STRONGLY FEINSTEIN 
FELT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS 
CALLING IT A MISTAKE, THIS 
NARROW 49-51 TO ADVANCE THE 
NOMINATION. 
SHE HAS BEEN AT THE CENTER OF 
THE STORM. 
THERE IS STILL BIG QUESTIONS 
ABOUT HOW THIS ANONYMOUS LETTER 
FROM CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD MADE 
IT INTO THE PUBLIC EYE. 
AND SHE HASN'T -- SHE DOESN'T 
HAVE CLEAR ANSWERS ABOUT THAT 
ASIDE FROM SAYING THAT SHE 
HERSELF AND HER OFFICE DIDN'T 
LEAK IT. 
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE WOMEN -- I 
SHOULD POINT OUT EVEN THOUGH 
THEY ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF 
THE AISLE, THE WOMEN OF THE 
SENATE MEET ROUTINELY AND TALK 
AMONG THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS. 
THEY WORK TOGETHER, THEY TAKE 
PRIDE IN WORKING TOGETHER. 
THEY TAKE PRIDE IN SHOWING THE 
MEN HOW CAPABLE THE TWO SIDES 
ARE OF WORKING TOGETHER, EVEN 
THROUGH DIFFICULT ISSUES. 
SO, FEINSTEIN AND MURKOWSKI 
HAVE A VERY LONG RELATIONSHIP 
WHERE THEY PROBABLY FEEL THAT 
THEY CAN BE BLUNT WITH ONE 
ANOTHER. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
NANCY CORDES YOU ARE ON THE 
HILL FOR US. 
OUR VIEWERS WATCHING, SENATOR 
JOHN CORNYN IS MAKING A SPEECH, 
I'M SURE IN ASSISTANCE DEFENSE 
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH BUT IT'S 
INTERESTING THAT THE MAJORITY 
WIP WHOSE JOB IT IS TO WHIP 
THE VOTES WALKED OVER TO 
SENATOR MURKOWSKI TO THANK HER. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING. 
APPRECIATE IT. 
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 
>> WE STILL HAVE MOLLIE HOOPER 
I BELIEVE ON THE PHONE. 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE GOING TO 
LISTEN TO SENATOR CORNYN OR 
KEEP DISCUSSING WHAT WE 
WITNESSED 15 MINUTES AGO. 
MOLLIE, WE WILL TALK TO YOU ON 
THE OTHER SIDE. 
>> SOMEBODY COULD BE DENIED A 
CONFIRMATION BASED ON AN 
UNPROVEN ALLEGATION, I CAN'T 
IMAGINE PEOPLE BEING WILLING TO 
SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THAT IN 
THE FUTURE. 
IT WOULD BE A DARK DAY FOR THE 
SENATE AND THE UNITED STATES 
AND FOR OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE 
THAT BELIEVES IN A FAIR PROCESS 
AND A CONSTITUTIONAL 
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND 
WHEN AN ALLEGATION IS MADE THAT 
THE PERSON MAKING THAT 
ALLEGATIO ACTUAL HAS TO -- 
ACTUALLY HAS TO COME FORWARD 
WITH SOME EVIDENCE. 
A NUMBER OF SENATORS, A 
BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS WANTED THE 
FBI TO CONDUCT A LIMITED 
INVESTIGATION INTO CURRENT 
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS PENDING. 
THEY WANTED THE FBI TO 
INTERVIEW INDIVIDUALS LIKE MARK 
JUDGE WHO HAD ALREADY OFFERED A 
SWORN STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY 
OF FELONY AND OTHERS WHO MAY 
HAVE HAD INFORMATION THAT WERE 
IDENTIFIED BY DR. FORD AS BEING 
PRESENT ON THE DAY THAT THIS 
ALLEGED ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE. 
THERE WAS NO -- NO 
CONFIRMATION, NO CORROBORATION 
THERE. 
WAS -- THE PEOPLE SHE SAID WERE 
THERE AND WERE WITNESSES TO 
WHAT HAPPENED SAID I HAVE NO 
KNOWLEDGE OF THAT. 
DR. FORD'S BEST FRIEND, LEYLAND 
KAISER SAID I DON'T KNOW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
I NEVER MET HIM. 
WE ALL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
READ THE CONFIDENTIAL REPORT. 
WE HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY WERE 
INTERVIEWED, WHAT THEY WERE 
ASKED AND ANY DOUBTS PEOPLE MAY 
HAVE HAD SHOULD BE PUT TO REST 
BY WHAT THE CONTENTS REVEALED. 
THESE FANTASIES OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH BEING A HIGH SCHOOL 
PREDATOR HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AS 
THAT. 
MYTHS.
IT'S NOT BASED ON FACT. 
AS WE KNOW THIS WASN'T DESIGNED 
TO BE A TRUTH FINDING PROCESS. 
THIS WASN'T A SEARCH FOR THE 
TRUTH. 
OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE 
MADE UP THEIR MIND A LONG TIME 
AGO, SOME BEFORE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WAS NOMINATED. 
THIS WAS MORE OF A -- NOT A 
SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH BUT A 
SEARCH AND DESTROY MISSION. 
AND OBVIOUSLY AS THEY CONTINUE 
TO MOVE THE GOAL POST CALLING 
FOR MORE DELAYS, MORE 
INVESTIGATIONS, THERE HAVE BEEN 
SEVEN BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS 
BY THE FBI OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
DURING HIS PUBLIC SERVICE. 
THE FBI TALKED TO MORE THAN 150 
WITNESSES. 
DON'T YOU THINK IF THERE WERE 
ANYTHING TO THESE OUTRAGEOUS 
ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME OF THAT 
WOULD HAVE COME UP AT SOME 
POINT IN THE SEVEN FBI 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED? 
BUT OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE 
AISLE RESIST PUTTING A 
DEFINITIVE END TO THE PROCESS 
AND UNFORTUNATELY CARING LITTLE 
IF ANY ABOUT THE REPUTATION OF 
SOMEONE THAT DEMONSTRATED HIS 
OUTSTANDING QUALIFICATIONS AND 
COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE. 
I THINK SOME OF THESE ATTACKS 
HAVE BECOME EXHAUSTIVE, 
POLITICALLY EXHAUSTED FRANKLY. 
OUR COLLEAGUES DON'T SEEM TO 
REALIZE WHAT THEY HAVE 
UNLEASHED WHEN SENATORS GET 
COAT HANGARS MAILED TO THEIR 
HOME. 
PROTESTERS, PAID PROTESTERS 
SHOW UP ON THEIR DOORSTEP OR 
OFFICE OR ARE ARE A COSSETED IN 
THE HALLS -- ACCOSTED IN THE 
HALLS OF THE UNITED STATES 
CONGRESS. 
PAID PROTESTERS THAT ONCE THEY 
GET ARRESTED MAKE MORE MONEY 
FROM THE FUNDERS THAN THEY DO 
IF THEY DON'T GET ARRESTED. 
THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN 
UNLEASHED. 
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY CALLED IT MOB 
RULE. 
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, DURING 
THE FIRST CONFIRMATION HEARING 
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SENATORS 
SAID I'M BREAKING THE RULES. 
I AM RELEASING COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 
I KNOW THE RULES PROHIBIT ME 
FROM DOING. 
AND THEY DON'T CARE. 
IF THERE ARE NO RULES AND NO 
NORMS, IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
RESPECT FOR THIS INSTITUTION 
AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WE 
TOUCH, THIS IS WHAT GETS 
UNLEASHED. 
I FEEL BADLY FOR DR. FORD IN 
PARTICULAR. 
SHE WANTED NONE OF THIS THREE 
RING CIRCUS. 
SHE SENT A LETTER TO THE 
RANKING MEMBER AND ASKED THAT 
HER IDENTITY REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
ONLY TO FIND AFTER THE FIRST 
CONFIRMATION HEARING THAT IT 
WAS LEAKED TO THE PRESS. 
AND THEN THE PRESS CAME TO TALK 
TO HER AND I GUESS SHE FIGURED 
SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE -- NO 
OTER RECOURSE BUT TO TELL HER 
STORY TO THE PRESS ONCE HER 
WISHES WERE VIOLATED. 
SHE DIDN'T CONSENT TO THAT. 
SHE DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THE 
RELEASE OF THAT CONFIDENTIAL 
LETTER WHERE SHE -- TO THE 
PRESS BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
YOU ARE LISTENING TO SENATOR 
JOHN CORNYN OF TEXAS. 
HE IS MAKING THE CASE WHY HE 
BELIEVES THAT JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE -- ADVANCED 
TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE 
LAND, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
HE SHOULD BE MADE AN ASSOCIATE 
JUSTICE. 
NOW WE WILL SHOW YOU WHAT IS 
HAPPENING JUST OUTSIDE OF THE 
CAPITAL WHERE YOU CAN SEE -- 
>> NOW WE HAVE POLICE OFFICERS. 
THERE WERE PROTESTERS UP AND 
DOWN THE HALLWAY. 
WE ARE TOLD SOME OF THEM ARE 
BEING ARRESTED. 
THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTERS 
THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING AND 
THROUGHOUT OUTSIDE, PROTESTERS 
TAKEN TO THE STREETS YESTERDAY 
BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE 
BUILDING WHERE THEY CAN GET 
CLOSER TO SOME OF THESE 
SENATORS. 
YOU KNOW, IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. 
PART OF THE REASON WHY THIS 
VOTE IS HAPPENING NOW AND 
HASN'T ALREADY HAPPENED IS 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOME 
DEMONSTRATORS TALKED TO SENATOR 
JEFF FLAKE AND CONVINCE HIM, AT 
LEAST THAT AN FBI -- AN 
ADDITIONAL PROBE BY THE FBI WAS 
WANTED. 
AND, SO, THEY ARE CLEARLY 
CONTINUING TO KEEP THE PRESSURE 
UP AS THE PROCESS MOVES 
FORWARD. 
>> MOLLIE HOOPER JOINS US. 
SHE IS A CBSN CONTRIBUTOR AND 
WRITES FOR THE HILL. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS 
INTERESTING IS TO KEEP ALL THIS 
IN PERSPECTIVE. 
SENATOR FLAKE, IN YOU WANT TO 
BELIEVE HIS SENTIMENTS AND THE 
INTERVIEWS THAT HE GAVE TO 60 
MINUTES WITH SENATOR CHRIS WAS 
MOVED BY THE INDIVIDUALS THAT 
CAME TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO 
LOOK INTO HIS HEART HUMAN TO 
HUMAN AND MAKE A DECISION BASED 
ON THE VERY REAL THINGS THAT 
HAPPENED. 
THEN YOU HAVE SENATOR HATCH 
THAT WENT THROUGH THIS WITH 
SENATOR THOMAS AND -- CLARENCE 
THOMAS AND ANITA HILL. 
THESE SENATORS ARE SOME OF THE 
MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THE 
WORLD. 
MANY OF THEM ARE MILLIONAIRES 
MANY TIMES OVER. 
THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS PLATFORM. 
THE ONLY TIME THEY ARE GOING TO 
HEAR ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FEEL 
ABOUT THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE 
IN THEIR NAME ARE WHEN THEY 
INTERACT AT THIS LEVEL. 
FOR A SENATOR TO DISMISS HOW 
PEOPLE ARE FEELING, I THINK IT 
SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHY PEOPLE ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE 
ANGRY WITH THIS CONGRESS. 
>> SURE. 
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DO TAKE THE 
DAY OFF WORK, WHO REALLY HAD 
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPEN IN 
THEIR LIFE TO TALK TO A SENATOR 
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH 
THEM, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. 
AND I TALKED TO BOB CORKER 
ABOUT THIS, ONE OF THOSE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS APPROACHED 
AT THE APARTMENT ON MONDAY BY A 
GROUP OF PEOPLE AND MEN DOING 
IT TO OTHER REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
AND WERE UP HERE IN THE HALLS 
OF CONGRESS GOING INTO OFFICES 
AND WHAT NOT AND SCREAMING AT 
THE SENATORS. 
BOB CORKER SAYS THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE 
WALKING ACROSS THE HALL SAYING 
THIS HAPPENED TO ME, I REALLY 
AM OPPOSED TO THIS PERSON, CAN 
YOU PLEASE CONSIDER THAT AND 
WHAT THEY ARE GETTING WITH THE 
PROTESTERS THAT ARE BUM RUSHING 
THEM AND SCREAMING IN THEIR 
FACE, NOT SAYING ANYTHING OR 
HAVING A CONVERSATION. 
I HAVE BEEN UP HERE ON CAPITOL 
HILL FOR QUITE A WHILE AND 
COVERED VARIOUS HIGH PROFILE 
ISSUES, POLARIZING MATTERS AND 
HAVE SEEN PROTESTERS. 
I WENT TO BERKELEY. 
>> ENOUGH SAID. 
>> BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I 
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
THIS. 
I AM STILL HERE. 
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
THIS. 
AND FOR SENATOR ORIN HATCH WHO 
HIS ME ADDRESS, HIS CELL 
PHONE, THEY WERE RELEASED ON 
WIKIPEDIA THE DAY ONE OF THE 
HEARINGS STARTED, YOU KNOW, 
PERHAPS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, 
THAT IS MAYBE WHERE HE WAS 
COMING FROM FOR SAYING -- SORT 
OF DISMISSING IT BUT EVEN BOB 
CORKER WHO ENGAGED WITH THE 
PROTESTERS AND ANSWERED THEIR 
QUESTIONS THEN WAS SCREAMED AT 
WHEN HE WALKED OUTSIDE THE 
AIRPORT, ANOTHER MAN WITH A 
CAMERA KIND OF SHOOTING HIM TO 
RECORD THIS, HE SAID THIS IS A 
TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING. 
JEFF FLAKE, THAT BIG MOMENT 
WITH THE PROTESTERS GETTING ON 
THE ELEVATOR OSTENSIBLY THAT 
TURNED HIM BUT KEEP IN MIND THE 
NIGHT BEFORE ON THURSDAY NIGHT 
HE HAD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH 
LISA MURKOWSKI, SUSAN COLLINS 
AND JOE MANCHIN AFTER THE DAY 
LONG THURSDAY HEARING. 
SO, GOES HE KNEW THAT HIS 
FELLOW COLLEAGUED QUESTIONS. 
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT MARK 
JUDGE. 
REPUBLICANS WANTED TO HEAR MORE 
INFORMATION FROM MARK JUDGE. 
SO, YES, THE PROTESTERS ARE 
DEFINITELY GALVANIZING PEOPLE 
BUT IT MAY BE HAVING THE 
OPPOSITE EFFECT. 
BOB CORKER SAID THEY MAY BE 
OVERPLAYING THEIR HANDS. 
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
REPUBLICANS TO CALL FOR A STOP 
TO THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION 
UNTIL THERE WAS A HEARING WITH 
DR. FORD. 
THIS ISN'T COMING FROM A 
PARTISAN ON EITHER SIDE. 
HE IS IN THE MIDDLE. 
HE SAID THE PROTESTERS MAY BE 
OVERPLAYING THEIR HANDS. 
THEY ARE SCREECHING AND NOT 
WILLING TO ENGAGE IN 
CONVERSATION. 
SO, IT'S QUITE A TIME TO BE ON 
CAPITOL HILL. 
>> GREAT WAY TO SUM IT UP. 
>> I RECALL THE PROTESTERS 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHILE THERE 
WAS TESTIMONY GOING ON, ONE OF 
THE OTHER THINGS THEY WERE 
YELLING IN THE HALLWAY IS 
NOVEMBER IS COMING. 
WE ARE LIVE IN A TIME WHERE 
FIRES FLARE-UP FAST AND 
FURIOUS. 
OFTEN IT IS SORT OF SHOCKING 
WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT SOMETHING 
HAPPENED A WEEK AGO. 
IT FEELS LIKE A MONTH HAS GONE 
BY. 
DO YOU THINK, AS WE WERE 
ANTICIPATION, THAT THIS 
NOMINATION, THE KAVANAUGH 
NOMINATION WILL HAVE AN IMPACT 
COME THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS OR 
DO YOU THINK BY THE TIME THEY 
ARE VOTING IN NOVEMBER, THERE 
WILL BE NINE OTHER THINGS WE 
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT? 
>> I THINK THAT -- THIS IS WHAT 
LINDSAY GRAHAM HAS BEEN SAYING 
PUBLICLY EVERYWHERE. 
THIS ISSUE OF HOW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION WAS 
HANDLED AND THE TACTICS 
EMPLOYED TO ATTEMPT TO STOP IT, 
THAT HAS GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS 
TO COALESCE UNDER ONE PARTY 
AGAIN. 
YOU HAVE THE ANTITRUMPERS AND 
THIS IS WHAT IS MOST STRIKING 
TO ME AFTER THE HEARING ON 
THURSDAY. 
TALKING TO REPUBLICAN WOMEN ON 
THE HOUSE SIDE. 
THE HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE A VOTE 
IN ALL THIS. 
REPUBLICAN WOMEN ONE OF WHOM 
WAS IN AN ANTITRUMP OFFICE AND 
IS NOT A BIG FAN OF THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THAT IS 
IT. 
PEOPLE WILL GO OUT TO VOTE. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH COULD HAVE BEEN 
MY SON. 
HE COULD HAVE BEEN MY FATHER, 
BROTHER. 
AND, YOU KNOW, HE WASN'T 
TREATED FAIRLY AND YOU RUINED 
THIS GUY'S REPUTATION, SAYING 
THE DEMOCRATS RUINED THIS GUY'S 
REPUTATION. 
IT WAS NOT FAIR. 
THEY SAT ON THE INFORMATION FOR 
45 DAYS WHICH MAY BE ONE REASON 
WHY HE IS VOTING THE WAY HE IS 
VOTING OR PROMPT HIM TO VOTE 
FOR KAVANAUGH. 
WHY DIDN'T THE COMMITTEE GO TO 
CALIFORNIA. 
SHE SAID UNDER OATH IN THE 
COMMITTEE THAT IT WASN'T CLEAR 
THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD GO TO 
HER. 
THE COMMITTEE REACHED OUT TO 
HER ATTORNEYS FOUR TIMES BEFORE 
A HEARING WAS AGREED TO. 
WE COULD COME TO YOU. 
REPUBLICANS ARE PAYING 
ATTENTION TO IT. 
AND THE SCORCHED EARTH TACTICS 
IS GALVANIZING THEM NOT 
NECESSARILY IN FAVOR OF TRUMP 
BUT DIRTY TRICKS. 
I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS 
FROM THE REPUBLICANS I WAS 
HEARING IT FROM. 
>> THAT IS AN INTERESTING 
POINT. 
SEVERAL REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS 
HAVE MENTIONED THAT TO US 
INCLUDING FRAN TOWNSEND THAT 
SAID UP UNTIL THIS MOMENT THEY 
HADN'T SEEN SOMETHING THAT 
GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS, EVEN 
THOSE THAT WERE NEVER TRUMPERS 
AROUND A SINGLE ISSUE. 
THE QUESTION IS THAT I WONDER 
IF THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING 
BECAUSE THE NARRATIVE -- THESE 
ARE FAST TIVES, 
-- NARRATIVES THAT EXIST IN THE 
MEDIA WORLD MAYBE NOT THE REAL 
WORLD. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE 
PRESIDENT, RIGHT? 
>> EXACTLY RIGHT. 
WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRATS HAS 
BEEN THEY ARE GALVANIZED AND 
THEY ARE ANGRY. 
YOU SAW A MILLION WOMEN 
MARCHING AFTER THE INAUGURATION 
AND THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT 
WILL COME OUT AND VOTE. 
THEY ARE TAKING THE LESSONS OF 
2014 THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS 
BEEN HAMMERING AT THE SPEECHES 
HE WAS GIVING THAT ELECTIONS 
HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 
PEOPLE GET IT. 
>> WHAT WE MAY SEE IS AFTER 
JUSTICE THOMAS WHICH WAS A WAVE 
OF WOMEN COMING IN. 
>> EXACTLY. 
IS THIS A WAY FOR REPUBLICAN 
POLLSTERS AND SPIN DOCTORS TO 
SAY, NO, WE ARE GALVANIZED THE 
SAME WAY THE GUYS ON THE BLUE 
TEAM ARE. 
>> HONESTLY, THESE PEOPLE HAD 
NO REASON TO SAY THAT THEY WERE 
FIRED UP LIKE THEY WERE. 
I HADN'T SEEN REPUBLICANS FIRED 
UP LIKE THIS. 
THE DEMOCRATS WERE ALREADY 
GALVANIZED. 
THEY WANT TO GET OUT THE VOTE. 
THEY ARE RARING TO GO. 
THIS ISN'T LIKE A RALLY TO GET 
TO THE POLLS. 
THE REPUBLICANS ARE SITTING 
BACK SAYING THINGS ARE GOING 
WELL. 
THAT IS WHO -- NOT ALL OF THEM 
LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
EVEN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ARE 
NOT BIG FANS. 
THEY HAVE A TOUGH TIME 
ANSWERING THE TWEETS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SENDS OUT. 
BUT, AGAIN, IT WASN'T 
NECESSARILY WHAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS OR THAT HE IS SUCH 
A GREAT JUSTICE. 
EVEN LISTENING ON THE SENATE 
FLOOR WE ARE NOT HEARING ABOUT 
THE CASES THAT HE HAS RULED IN 
FAVOR OF OR AGAINST OR THE 
POSITIONS HE HAS TAKEN OR HOW 
MANY TIMES HE HAS BEEN 
OVERRULED BY THE SUPREME COURT. 
WE ARE LISTENING TO HOW HE WAS 
TREATED WHEN SOMEBODY ACCUSED 
THIS MAN OF COMMITTING CRIMES, 
COMMITTING A FELONY AND NOT 
ABLE TO PROVE IT PER SAY OR 
PROVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
GOING TO BE VOTING. 
THAT DOES GALVANIZE FOLKS THAT 
DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE 
A PART OF THEIR LIVES, MORE FOR 
LIMITED GOVERNMENT AND INNOCENT 
 
I REALIZED WHAT A BIG DEAL IT 
WAS -- THE THING FASCINATING TO 
ME, I TALKED TO THREE 
REPUBLICAN WOMEN WHO I THOUGHT 
OH, WHAT ARE THY GOING TO SAY 
AND IN FACT IT WAS THE OPPOSITE 
OF WHAT I ANTICIPATED TO HEAR. 
LISA MURKOWSKI, YOU KNOW, SHE 
HAS REASONS AGAINST JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH BASED ON THE RULINGS 
THAT HE HAS MADE AND THE E-
MAILS HE SENT IN HIS ROLE AS 
GEORGE W. BUSH'S PERSONAL 
SECRETARY BACK IN THE BUSH 
YEARS. 
BUT REGARDING THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, THAT PUTS IT IN A 
DIFFERENT BOX. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT INNOCENT 
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 
SHE WAS A COUNTY PROSECUTOR. 
IT'S THOSE FOLKS THAT GET FIRED 
UP. 
THERE IS A REASON LINDSAY 
GRAHAM IS FIRED UP ABOUT THIS. 
YOU GOT TO HAVE EVIDENCE. 
YOU GOT TO HAVE IT. 
WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT, IT'S 
LIKE HOW DOES JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
IF HE IS NOT CONFIRMED, HOW 
DOES HE GO BACK TO THE BENCH. 
IF THE SENATE THINKS HE 
COMMITTED THIS SEXUAL ASSAULT, 
HOW DOES HE GO BACK TO THE 
BENCH. 
WILL THEY TAKE ACTIONS -- IF 
DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
SENATE, WILL THEY TRY TO 
IMPEACH HIM AS A FEDERAL JUDGE? 
IT JUST SHAKES UP EVERYTHING. 
DONALD TRUMP, AS CAITLYN WAS 
SAYING, APPOINTING JUDGES, THIS 
IS THE REASON SO MANY 
REPUBLICANS WENT TO THE POLLS 
AND VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP, 
EVANGELICALS VOTED FOR DONALD 
TRUMP. 
AD UNLESS YOU HAVE A 
GALVANIZING ISSUE LIKE THIS, 
GOES IT'S HARD TO GET THOSE 
FOLKS OUT IN THE MIDTERMS. 
ASK BUSH IN 2006. 
IT DIDN'T GO WELL FOR HIM. 
IT'S UNCLEAR. 
UNLESS I HEARD MY SOURCES TELL 
ME WITH THEIR OWN -- UNLESS 
THEY TOLD ME THIS PERSONALLY I 
WOULD PROBABLY THINK OH, THE 
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, WISHFUL 
THINKING BUT I DON'T KNOW. 
>> WE ARE A MONTH OUT. 
WE HAVE TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS 
OUT. 
MOLLIE, GREAT TO HAVE YOUR 
INSIDE AND ANALYSIS AND 
REPORTING.

WALLACE.
