please join me in welcoming dr. Sebastian Gorka tonight I'm going to keep my comments short it's a real honor to be here it was about touch up on a handful of topics and then open the floor to your questions so what I'm going to talk about is who is Donald J Trump really that's what everybody asks then what really happened on the vent of the a to 2016 and what happened when we moved into the White House and what was it like to work in the White House and then I'll talk a little bit about what your role will be in 2018 okay so who is Donald Trump everybody wants to know what do you really like well guess what if you've had a pulse amid breathing for the last 30 years and switched on a television set or the newspaper or looked on the internet you know Donald Trump he is what you see is what you get it's exactly who he is unlike most people who work on this hill there is no public Trump and private Trump you know what I mean right you go to those fancy cocktail parties in Georgetown or Adams Morgan and everybody you know the second they shake your hand what they doing they do the DC handshake go out to shake their hand and they're already looking over your shoulder you say is there anybody else more important in the world when a camera comes into the room they put on that Washington grimace right that fake smile the public persona versus the private guess what this guy from Queens what you see is what you get behind closed doors when it was just the two of us in the Oval Office is exactly the same as whether he's in front of 60,000 people in stadia or on his reality TV show or addressing Congress it is unfiltered it is the Donald let me give you how I knew this from the get-go first time I met him some of what was it 2015 I got a phone call from a guy called Cora never heard of coronet because here and he says a candidate Trump is preparing for 80 Republican National Security debate this fall and he'd like somebody to help me with my security issues would you be willing to come to New York I said sure so I've looked flew to New York went to Trump Tower went up to mr. Trump candidate Trump's or office and it was just the president future president literally sitting across the desk closer than Lionel Aires and their quarry in the corner and we just hire if ikonn laughs security issues from civil war to nuclear weapons to the Middle East you name it and halfway through halfway through it he just stopped mid-sentence looked at Corey and said I like this guy that's hiring so it's decisiveness yes it's by reckless it's wrong that's who he was as head of the Trump trying corporation or as a president of the greatest nation on God's earth what happened on November the 8th 2016 I'll give you my interpretation now don't take this personally but it's a fact bojay Trump was only accidentally the GOP candidate for president let's remind ourselves of the most trenchant fact about this individual he is the first human being since 1776 to become the most powerful man in the world without ever holding public office or serving as a general in the US Armed Forces why is that just think about the enormity of that faculty that is a testament to the reality that he is the quintessential anti-establishment candidate he didn't owe anybody anything but on the left but on the right he is an antibody to the establishment that has so poorly served our nation for the last thirty years whether it was on the right or whether it was on the left think about another question why did this man run for president do you think he did it for the money you think he did it for the fame he didn't mean either of us and look at what he's put up with just today we have this horrific story of his son's family being threatened by a potential anthrax attack luckily it wasn't a biological or chemical agent but this is what he's put up with whether it's the media attracting his 10 year old son or say outrageous things about him and his family this man is putting up with all of this for one very simple reason he loves this country if you want to understand the whole Trump the best way to understand it beyond you know read the book the art of the deal please read the book you really will get a strategic insight into who the press it is but also understand that he is a melding he's of mounding of two things he is the ultimate pragmatist think about it the guy who was a billionaire salesman realtor crushing it in the toughest market in the world New York real estate yeah you can't look at the world through an ideological lens when they're doing real estate either it's worth X amount per square foot or it's not worth X amount per square foot so it's a pragmatist who is at the same time a patriot loves this country and all he's doing attending this with personal experience working for or he is doing right now all that he's putting up with it's for a very simple objective view he spent 50 years of his life you know what I wish I had a quarter of his energy at the age of 47 that he has an age of 71 a guy is impressive very all he is doing is that he's taken what he has done for 50 years which is a dedication to excellence whenever he touched whether it was a golf course in Scotland when it was a skyscraper in America whether it was a commercial product excellence was the watchword and he's taking that and just transmuting it just transferring it to what America to get us back to being the first the best in the world that doesn't mean alone this is one of the biggest misunderstandings America first does not mean America alone if you want to understand what it really means what read one thing read the Washington but the the Warsaw address by Donald Trump that one speech will I predict go down in history as one of the most consequential political speeches in modern times and the essence of that speech very simple and don't forget where it was said we worked very hard the polls didn't want to do this security and ovens it was very important for us that he made that speech at the site of the Warsaw Uprising the more very important the president's region warsaw was unequivocal America is back a world without American leadership is dangerous but we are not here like some dastardly neocon kebab to invade other people's countries and invade them that's an American this nation was born in a rebellion against empiricism we don't do that we don't fade other people's countries a train pull with our system upon them it's on America but we are proud of our heritage we are proud of being a judeo-christian nation and if you share our judeo-christian values whether you are Poland in Europe whether you are Israel in the Middle East we will stand shoulder to shoulder with you that's right your mana powers up we're not giving holes I went like upon you but if you wish to share in those values we will be your friend it's on an accident the three very senior members of the Trump administration the chair of the dry cheese etc fans and chief of staff or old Marines but up not only are they old Marines they come from the same Marine Corps division did you know that and that division has an informal water now it's not being taken up officially at the Trump administration's motto but I like to think it is and that motto of that Marine Corps division is no better friend no worse enemy that is America first so that's who he is that's what happened at the election and by the way I'm not gonna do a poll but if you don't believe in God you have no idea what happened that was divine intervention at the context this is a man who was an outsider didn't get support from the establishment this establishment it wanted but he wiped the floor with 8 with 16 establishment candidates and then it proceeds to do what defeat a woman who had spent artificially 1.4 billion dollars on a position she thought was owed to her because of her gender and her last name but only that that woman who spent almost 1/2 billion dollars had the median in her pocket ok apart from Sean on Fox Washington Times and Breitbart everybody else practically was in the tank and just remember what the Huffington Post said on the day with the election and the New York Times she has more than a 95 percent chance of winning on the day of the election oh the sweet irony so despite all of that he won and that's proof positive the man upstairs is helping us so what happened a few months later when we moved into the White House amazing day I'm an American now proud American but six years ago I was green card holders immigrant a legal immigrant and then I end up at 8 a.m. or the 21st of January walking around the West way that's America yeah that's yeah but let's be honest what happened on Chinese 20 as a function of being a an anti-establishment campaign we weren't you up also yo let me see if anybody has anybody seen the original the original the crummy remake the original Red Dog if you have it tonight streaming the original Arendt thought Patrick Swayze Wolverine's right that is a story about the Soviet Union and Cuba invading the United States great movie by a drug Milius God gave us Conan the Barbarian and in that story who remembers who defeated the Soviets yes a bunch of high-school students called war Marines with their dads Bob action rifle right guess what that push to have you xx it was a you know a band of merry men and women a very small band that moved into the West Wing to take over the largest organization in the world remember if you add the Armed Forces we are talking about millions of employees or the federal government and as such it was I like to describe it as the most leveraged Hospital takeover in political history and that's one of the reasons why some months later of mine medium of speed decided to resign I decided the best way to serve the president is to do so from the outside where the swamp creatures far weaker and where we can get a lot more done so that's what happened or trying the 20th hostile leverage takeover but what's happened in the last 30 months I mean you know the track record yes you hear the talking points hopefully both but just let's remind ourselves look at the economy the economy has been unleashed for eight years President Obama couldn't once get three percent GDP growth rate this President did it in two quarters already massive American companies are bringing literally billions of dollars back to America tens of thousands of jobs created by private industry more than 2 million created in the last 12 months alone tax reform defeat of Isis in terms of its caliphate revitalization of our alliances on and on and on business this is the track record that you would be proud of at the end of your as president not your first year that's what's possible if you have leadership and if you love this nation yeah so what's left to do a lot we need to have seven years of president Trump from this day forward and then eight years of president pets as the trial of people who escaped cons dictatorship it's just the words family yeah I do this for a living I talk for a living very rarely two words fail me but to see CNN MSNBC the left-wing fake news industrial complex salivating over the chief of propaganda for the North Korean regime a woman whose whose family runs a country where there are labor camps where people are tortured because they have the wrong political beliefs we're according to left wing left wing NGOs ten million people are on the brink of starvation because of their regime that's the left that's like celebrating Himmler that's like celebrating gurbles yes it's like going back to water Durante back in the 20s and 30s the New York Times Pulitzer Prize winner who was writing hagiographies about how great Stalin is and have superb communism is we've returned to the age of water Duran tea despite the fact that having I bumped into him on daily basis Mike Pence the vice president is probably one of the most honorable man this man this nation has ever seen the way he has been treated in last week is absolutely the pond oh of course before we do some Q&A on what the movement role is what the ideological role of president is and what your role is I like to describe the president there's an icebreaker ship another ships the deployed break through the permafrost ice caps to open up shipping lanes for more than a generation this nation and specialty body politic academia and the media was frozen solid in a stasis state of political correctness the federal government would tell you who was allowed to take showers with your teenage daughter just insanity political correctness gone mad what comes a man who owes nothing to that political correctness that just breaks through it like a sledge hammer like an ice breaker does anybody know the mechanics of ice breaking the ice breaking trip breaks of passage but what happens next if you don't keep that passage open what happens around the bow at the back of the ship almost instantly the ice will come back and reknit and close that passageway again you need to have a flotilla you need to have ships immediately come in and keep that pathway open keep it free it is our jobs now it's not the establishments jobs I'm sorry I'm gonna be national review those okay I mean crystal is you know when when an alleged conservative tweets I mean this blows my mind but somebody who is allegedly conservative tweets in a choice between a deep state as the Trump I choose the deeps well then go and join some Maoist collective in Cambodia where a wrestler services are no longer needed so it's our job especially your jobs is young Republicans to support the Icebreaker strip it's a really exciting time because now we have to clarify first things first principles what does it mean to be a conservative in the 21st century what exactly is the role of government today what is the role when it comes to new technologies what is the role in national security where we have all kinds of new threats what isn't rolling in economics is the Laffer curve good enough do we just you know dust off a Hayek and Mises or is it more complicated this is the heavy lift thing we have to do today that's what great minds out there you need to be a part of it as well and most important of all I'd like to engage all of you if you wish I'd like to make you all members of Team Trump I don't have any membership cards to give out but if you wish it will be anointed as members to met and do something for the President and for this nation push back on the lies yeah it's not gonna Grassley don't get on the soapbox but whether it's at the water cooler with it yep over margaritas tonight whatever it is okay when something starts trotting out tired talking points from the lab just ask them a few select questions when they call the president his team racist white supremacist and anti-semites just tell them you do know right that the president's grandchildren are also the doctor Jews you do know that yes right I mean it's just Bush bags because they're all eyes this man I can tell you hand on life a good book was he writes worth he doesn't have a racist bone in his body the most important thing the most important message you can send out there is that this man loves America the most important of all and I know this from talking to this is the stunning thing about it after all he's been through and we'll go through this man only wants two things for everybody in this in this country but in this room in this country he wants every American to be safe and he wants every American and their families to prosper irrespective of who they vote that's who Donald Trump he doesn't care if you go to fail or if you wanted to Bernie to win or if you stayed at home if you're an American legally here in America you deserve this government protecting you and you deserve this government getting out of the way of the economy that defeated Hitler and the Soviet Union unleashing America's might again whether you put a D behind your name or arm behind your name so that's okay thanks for watching if you want to see the rest of my videos please subscribe to the rebel media YouTube channel and don't forget to follow
