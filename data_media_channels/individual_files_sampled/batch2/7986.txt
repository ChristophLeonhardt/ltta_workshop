what we've had so far in the hearings is a couple of speeches long speeches by Grassley and Feinstein to start the proceedings and then finally Christine Blasi Ford spoke her testimony was incredibly powerful and that's why there's tremendous value in having hearings because when you see someone say it with your own eyes it's it just has a wildly different impact than reading it in a paper and and you can look at that person and think credible or not credible that's why we bring in witnesses and trials and and I so I was about to say I can't imagine that anyone didn't find her credible but I have a unique perspective on this because I was on the other side the last time this happened and it is incredibly powerful what bias does to you you mean Anita Hill yes so when I when I was watching and I watched all the the three days of testimony I was glued to my TV during the Anita Hill clarence thomas hearings 27 years ago and and I was a Republican back then and and I just looked at everything through the lens of how can I prove it wrong how could I see that she's wrong and through that lens I saw what I wanted to see and so that is why I'm sure that some people are looking at these hearings and looking at doctor Blasi and that's what she goes by professionally and thinking now for four reasons i right now can't fathom because I'm looking at her from my lens today not not credible but I think to anyone who does not look at it from a hard lens if you will of one side or the other looked at than I thought well I don't see any reason why she would be lying about this and then - I mean again she'd have to be some sort of Svengali political apparatchik genius-level deceptive person to have pulled off that lie in that way and so I think that even the Republicans think that part is so just because they're now going to mistaken identity as their main defense so what about the the other theory and again playing devil's advocate here trying to understand why some people might frame their argument was they look for reasons okay it is true but they did have the letter at the end of July maybe they thought he she didn't want her name I'll grant that she didn't want her name out there and they thought well they'll beat him in a different way and then at the last second when there's not enough time to respond they dropped this bomb at the very last second in a desperate hail-mary attempt to undercut the nomination and deny Ana seat on the Supreme Court when the behavior of somebody thirty what is it six years ago in high school shouldn't be determinative and he didn't really even have a chance to respond to it in open session and this is clearly a politically timed attack whether it's true or not well it's the to response to that one she addressed that really thoroughly in the morning and obviously guys we're covering this live if you're watching this later whenever there is really important is sort of stuff like this we go live on T y-t-dot-com slash live and and our members he had all the coverage anytime they wanted so become a member at TYT dot-com slash join so to answer your questions in the live hearings she said look uh I didn't want to come forward because I was scared of what was gonna happen to me in an invasion of privacy and in a super powerful moment she explained how she had told her husband for the first time back in 2012 in couples therapy because they had started a dispute over how she wanted a second front door in the house and he couldn't understand it he's like that's crazy why would anybody want a second front door that makes no sense and she had to explain there's an assault that happened I'm when I was 15 years old and she explained and later in the hearings they made her claustrophobic because the thing that really shook her psychologically was when he covered her mouth and she couldn't breathe and so that second front door is devastating it's devastating in terms of its impact on our life and you could see how it has affected her for all those years and it's devastating as and as evidence for her state of mind and so here's a person who wanted two different escape routes in our own home so can you not see how she would be reluctant to come forward and what happened when she came forward she was literally chased out of that house yeah her as she said that right before that that her baby was right after but her the fears that she had were they were not as bad as what actually happened yeah and so the two front doors did not help her because now they may chase her out of our own home and for those you who don't see the details of the things that have happened to her she explained to her her home her parents home all doxxed so online people know where they are and then her emails were hacked so there are people that who's either job or hobby or whatever they've taken upon themselves to attack her and to ruin her credibility in every way they can to get Kavanagh on the Supreme Court did the reason for the email hack was to to pretend as she wrote an e-mail recanting so they could get that in the press even if it only lasted a day or two it's for PR purposes to try to affect the public opinion against her right so that is why she did not come forward with her name until she explained the reporters are on to her and they came to her college and all her boss called her colleagues they came to her house and so she thought well it's over they already know what my name is haigha might as well come forward with my name and and make it public so now here's a part that is fair if you're a Republican it was Feinstein decided not to make her name public and was never going to apparently because she was honoring doctor blah C's wishes another Democratic colleague basically leaked it to the papers okay so if you want to be mad at whoever that Democratic senator is okay or staffer or staffer right and and so if you say that part is political okay okay but that's a totally different question than whether she's telling the truth but and and I and I I mean I wouldn't even necessarily use the word political only because it minimizes it because we now use that word as a way of saying everything that happens as a result of that is dismissible because it's just politics nominating Brett Kavanaugh in a supreme court is political an unbelievably political move as all Supreme Court nominees are this one particularly political but they're all political so yeah someone released her name and you could argue about that and and and you're right Ben I mean where you're going with this which is that look if you're a Republican gonna be Superman to that person release it release it eleventh hour etc but on the other hand if you're a regular American I was gonna say a woman but doesn't matter I feel the same exact way and I think a lot of us do you could be thankful to that staffer or senator saying hey you know what in despite that the tremendous down sided his hat for doctor Blasi it is as if all this is true and it certainly appears that way right now it is a great service to the country not to put Cavanaugh in the Supreme Court yeah I also would like to point out just that the way we think things happen from you know all the presidents man is somebody in a parking garage called a reporter and released the name actually a lot of ways that it could have and I'm not looking to exonerate this unnamed 29 year old Democratic staffer or 87 year-old Democratic senator but uh but but it gave them credit somebody could accidentally seen it in an email somebody could have seen papers that they weren't supposed to see they're a whole lot of ways the reporters get stories I hear you but I tend to know is suppose she given the timing the overwhelming likelihood is they leaked it on purpose and and again you could at you look at it is something terrible and political in the 11th hour or you look at it as something great hey this guy who is attempted a rape is go and as line about it his whole life and is lied over and over again is about to get one of the most important in the world I can't let it stand for because he's going to make decisions about the lives of all Americans for the next possibly 20 30 40 years including the lives of women and I cannot let it be this guy maybe it's another conservative but maybe it's active service I guess I'm not your way is more likely I'm just arguing that there is I mean the Washington Post reporters who knew the name privately may have thought this is an incredibly big story but we can and may have hinted to another reporter of how they would investigate it and find it another way there's just a whole host of ways once a few people knew and once people at the Washington Post knew that there that that story could have gotten out but obviously it didn't it wasn't leaked by Republicans yeah and so the second part of the answer to your question Ben is honestly what difference does that differ does it make so okay it's its 11th hour and I wish it was an 11th hour I wish we have it during the hearings so we could have the testimony from Debbie Ramirez and Mark judge and now the third and the fourth women and I you know I don't know the credibility of the third and fourth women because sweat Nick a is really really heavy charges the including gang rape does she talked about but very unclear she said the Kavanagh was present right no one knows what that means and if by present you mean at the party and downstairs that's a very different present than in line as she described it right so so I would want to hear that testimony I would the fourth person is anonymous you know so that has even less you know wait if you will so I wish it was an 11th hour but being what it is what difference does it make the only question is did he do these things or did he not do these things I mean at a bare minimum no matter how right wing left wing you are can we not get agreement that if he did do these things that he definitely should not be on the Supreme no you cannot get that agree okay you can't that's right in fact you know you can't yeah in fact there was a poll out just yesterday 54% of Republicans say that even if he did it it's no big deal and he should be on the court no well that Wow for whatever it's worth it if you were gonna have public opinion determine this the good news about that is is that it's not 84% and that's not enough yeah and because overall in the country it's only about 26% who know to be fair and more accurate about the exact wording in the poll 26% believe Kavanagh already about 34 if I remember right but a higher percentage believe her but the biggest number well I think around 42% say I don't know I'm not sure and that's why these hearings are so it's all anecdotal it's the power of television and and probably shouldn't be aired but I'm about to repeat it but you'll see it a lot but even on on MSNBC you know they'll do folk they'll find just people right and so they find this woman with two daughters look like they were maybe teenagers maybe one of them yeah honey yeah right and they're like a mint boys grow up girls and the kids are like nodding they're like whatever he deserves to be on the court is obviously a trump supporter and therefore Kavanagh supporter and just dismissing it offhand those people are out there so the notion that it once it's established even if the real question is there's really it ends up being quite simple if if she comes off as completely credible on two counts one that had happened to that unequivocally the person who did that - or was Kavanagh at 17 years old there are only four people who matter here ultimately Jeff Flake bob Corker lisa murkowski and susan collins unless there is a fifth strand of nobility it's not nobility and I'll tell you what the Pitts strand is in a second we go of political practicality or but I'm admitting that there's a you know these are human beings and at some point somebody may go you know I believe her and this is a let's just have a different nama that's less likely that's so will flake corker are Murkowski and Collins be persuaded will two of them be persuaded to stop this they have the complete power to stop it there won't even be a vote they'll just tell Mitch McConnell I'm a note and that's the end of that yeah and he won't and McConnell cancelled a vote tomorrow and they'll start this process over again and it won't there will be no hearings well there could be hearings in the lame-duck session but there won't be hearing until after the midea look like I said soon as her tests of original testimony was over it might already be over like I think obviously Murkowski and Collins are watching that and they're rare Republican female senators and I'm like picturing them in a room in my mind's eye like looking at each other like it's over right yeah it's we just like we just run can we do it together yeah yeah and so okay now that's of course speculation so let me explain what the fifth strand is so there's the four senators that had been talked about it could be that they caucus after the day is over and guys Kavanagh has not testified yet you also got to hear him out and we will hear him out as we cover it throughout the day so the fifth possibility is they caught the Republicans caucus ingo you think you're gonna lose in in South Carolina and do you think you're gonna lose in Iowa if you lose enough female voters they're just gonna make a political calculation because remember politicians the thing that they care about most is themselves so at the end of the day it is all a political calculation so if they think right or wrong this is too much damage to our electoral chances we're losing women by the minute okay and we're having democratic women show up to vote by the minute by the hour in in numbers that are gonna wash us out of the Senate or wash our colleagues in close races out of the Senate we're done with this there's there's a political calculation to be made by senators other than flake corker Murkowski and Collins that takes the pressure off of them there is a right a possibility that enough go mitchum I think we're done I think we're done here yeah yeah and even people not in this Senate like Rick Scott running against Bill Nelson in Florida in a very tight race about tide could call McConnell and go what are you guys doing to me wait I if this goes on for another day I'm toast there were four Senate races polls I saw from Senate races yesterday Florida was one of them Tennessee was one of them where the the discrepancy between women two men was dramatic I think it was between 17 and 20 points in those four polls that women were voting a democratic well the poll that I keep a quota happen over the weekend report in The Wall Street Journal devastating stats the lead among men for Republicans that is said a historic load said three points and the lead that Democrats of them have among women is up to 25 points that's a 22 point difference I've never seen anything like that yeah and even and by the way real quick Nelson 17 over Scott among women to a 20-point black poll cinema 15 over mcsalley that's in Arizona among women stabbing out 24 over Jane's among women of Mitchell poll and Tammy Baldwin 27 over her opponent among women in Wisconsin and getting larger by the minute and so in the last part of the poll that was devastating was in Republican districts Republican lead is down to one point that's including deeply red districts that is a terrible number unprecedented ly bad number so the I tell you guys that not in relationship to is Christine Blasi for telling the truth or not we're giving you both angles here the substance of the allegations and the politics behind the scenes that's gonna affect the decision okay so at some point mcsalley rick scott james and clay mère ubu c'mere the the republicans running in those tight races we just talked about are calling mcconnell probably right now going let's end it we got to go remember at Tammy Baldwin I think Trump won Wisconsin Tammy Baldwin was considered a horrible Democrat I would say right now a Democrat running 27 points ahead and women is probably a lot less vulnerable than people thought 100% and and here's other important context guys so and this used to drive me crazy when MSNBC did it and CNN did and etc they would talk about how Democrats have a lead among women they would leave out that Republicans had an equal or greater lead among men well that's pretty important to leave out but that lead among men is now gone so when you see 27 points on the other side opponent is not of a 27-point lead among men so nationally like I told you men will lead that Republicans have among men is down to three points compared to seventeen twenty seven etc for women and women are showing up to vote man that is a recipe for political disaster for the Republicans in forty days okay so back to the substance now another thing that was important that was said during the proceedings is this is not a trial of Christine Blasi Ford or necessarily even of Kavanagh this is a job interview and and we talked about this yesterday on The Young Turks do you think that if you went for a job interview and there were these kind of serious allegations against you then you'd have any chance at all I mean if you're applying for checkout at Walmart it doesn't matter what you're applying for and somebody comes to your boss and says attempted rape possible gang rape sexual assault etc you're a gonner man you know you're a gonner and and that might not be fair to you especially because then you all get hearings like this you won't get proceedings etc but here he he's got an opportunity to respond we've got hearings it's it's more than fair they're not calling the other witnesses that they should be calling et cetera but he's applying for one of the most important jobs in the country and you can't fire him you could impeach him but that would be enormous ly difficult so it's a lifetime appointment yes we need to know whether these charges are true or not so that we decide and it's 330 million people in the country you could put somebody else on the court I know I know that the elections are coming and that is why there are other political categories that's why the Republicans are rushing and that's why the Democrats want to delay it I mean that's and it's literally the excuse they used to delay Merrick garland the hangings are about to start here's one sense to Jenks second point about the broader political message for Republicans that could take the pressure off those four senators this morning Chris Wallace on Fox News this was extremely emotional extremely raw and extremely credible this is a disaster for the Republicans that's what Chris Wallace said on Fox News I'm telling you it's almost over already these are excellent answers so far super credible and I'm now thinking Rachel Mitchell's I was saying he was a law - I now think there might not be any return I think the turn is happening here to the extent that she's going to focus on the amount of time that Democrats knew about this and didn't know but that's from her perspective of asking doctor for Blasi Ford it's kind of irrelevant it's just a political point and why Rachel Mitchell's not a supposed to be political actors so I better the political appointment but she'll do what they say I mean that's what they you know and to Hertz then she may think great okay I'll just establish the Democrats to did sat on this information and that's true so I don't have any problem doing that but I'm done unwinding her story yeah I mean what I'm super curious about is now what's left in the rest of the days two things one is is there ever going to be a pivot where they question her version of events right where Rachel Mitchell goes but is it true that right and I don't know if that's ever gonna come and if it doesn't then they're in even bigger trouble and then obviously I'm curious what Kavanagh is gonna say he could just huff and puff and give lawyerly answers if he does he's toast I don't know how in the world he can recover let's act on the final thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't
