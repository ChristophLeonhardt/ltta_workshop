INTERESTING NEWS COMING OUT OF
THE HILL AND MANY OTHER PLACES.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS THEY
EXPLAINED, WHO BATTLED
HILLARY CLINTON IN THE 2016
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY AND
CREATED A REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT
AMONG MILLENNIAL'S, IS
HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN.
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
FIREWORKS.
LET'S GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.
JEFF WEAVER, BERNIE SANDERS THE
FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER
SAYS HE IS KEEPING THE DOOR
OPEN.
BERNIE SANDERS ASSOCIATE SAYING,
IS HE CONSIDERING RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT?
YES, IS THE ANSWER.
HOW IS THAT FOR CLEAR?
THE SAME ASSOCIATE CONTINUES, HE
THINKS HE'S EARNED THE RIGHT TO
RUN AGAIN, AND HE BELIEVES IF HE
WOULD'VE BEEN THE DEMOCRATIC
CANDIDATE HE WOULD HAVE ONE
AGAINST TRUMP, GIVEN THAT HE HAD
A 12 POINT LEAD ON ELECTION DAY,
THAT CERTAINLY IS FAR MORE
LIKELY THAN WHAT HAPPENED WITH
HILLARY CLINTON.
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
ONE MORE QUOTE FROM THE SAME
ASSOCIATE, THE LAST THING
HE IS GOING TO DO IS STEP ASIDE
AND LET JOE BIDEN TAKE IT.
OF COURSE, WHY SHOULD HE?
HE IS THE MOST POPULAR
POLITICIAN IN THE COUNTRY.
ON WHAT PLANET SHOULD THE MOST
POPULAR GUY STEP ASIDE FOR
PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS POPULAR?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT
ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF
POLITICS BUT TO BE FAIR, THERE
IS AGE ISSUE, WHEREAS JOE
BIDEN IS A SPRING CHICKEN.
NO RIGHT, JOE BIDEN IS ONLY ONE
YEAR YOUNGER THAN BERNIE
SANDERS DIVE YOU THINK HE
SHOULDN'T RUN BECAUSE OF AGE,
YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY PRESSURE
JOE BIDEN'S GET OUT OF THE RACE.
BUT NOBODY IS DOING THAT.
NOBODY BRINGS OF JOE BIDEN'S AGE
EVEN OF THEIR PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME AGE.
IT IS ALMOST LIKE THEY DON'T
LIKE BERNIE SANDERS, AND
ARE MAKING UP EXCUSES.
I HAVE MORE ON THAT IN A LITTLE
BIT.
IS HE RUNNING?
THERE ARE A LOT OF TALE TELL
SIGNS.
EARLIER THIS MONTH, HE TRAVELED
IOWA FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE LOSING THE STATES
COCKINESS CAUCUSES TO
CLINTON DURING THE DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARY.
HE GAVE A KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT AN
EVENT SPONSORS BY THE IOWA
CITY CITIZENS FOR COMMUNITY
IMPROVEMENT I DOESN'T TAKE
A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO KNOW
THAT YOU GO TO IOWA IF YOU
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAT NO
ONE ELSE GOES TO IOWA.
I'M KIDDING, GOOD PEOPLE OF
IOWA, AND GETTING THAT
CITIZEN IOWA IN THE NEXT MONTH
HE WILL RETURN TO THE STATE
AND TO PROMOTE HIS BOOK, BERNIE
SANDERS: GUIDE TO POLITICAL
REVOLUTION.
THAT IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
101.
YOU GO TO IOWA, YOU COME UP
WITH A NEW BOOK THAT HE JUST
WROTE A REVOLUTION, HE IS
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DIET
IS SUPER OBVIOUS THAT THEY'RE
NOT TRYING TO HIDE IT.
LARRY COHEN, TOP ADVISOR TO
BERNIE SANDERS FOR A LONG
TIME SAYS I CAN SPEAK FOR THE
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO
SUPPORTED SUPPORTED HIM AND
SAYING WE WOULD LOVE IT IF
HE RUNS AGAIN, AND WHERE HOPEFUL
HE WILL RUN AGAIN.
THAT IS VERY NORMAL, AND THAT
DOESN'T NECESSARILY GIVE
YOU THE MINDSET OF BERNIE
SANDERS, BUT IT CERTAINLY
SAYS IF YOU WERE TO RUN AGAIN,
HIS TOP ADVISERS IN THE MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE FOND OF HIM
ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT HIM.
THAT IS WHY THE DEMOCRATIC
ESTABLISHMENTS IN A PANIC
RIGHT NOW.
ANOTHER BERNIE SANDERS ASSOCIATE
SAYS HE'S KEEPING ALMOST
THE SAME SCHEDULE THAT A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
WOULD KEEP THAT HE'S DOING MORE
TROUBLE, MORE RALLIES, MORE
FOR THE DNC THAN ANYONE ELSE.
YES, REMEMBER THE OLD EXCUSE FOR
WHY THEY DIDN'T WANT BERNIE
SANDERS WAS HE IS AN INDEPENDENT
THAT HE IS NOT EVEN A DEMOCRAT.
WHAT IS HE DONE FOR THEM IT
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?
RIGHT NOW, NO ONE HAS GONE TO
MORE CAMPAIGN EVENTS FOR
OTHER DEMOCRATS THAN TO BERNIE
SANDERS HAS DIE IF YOU DON'T
THINK BERNIE SANDERS HAS DONE
ENOUGH FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
THEN YOU THINK NO ONE HAS BEEN
THE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
THOUGHT IT WOULD DISQUALIFY
EVERY PERSON IN THE RACE.
THESE ARE ALL NONSENSE EXCUSES
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT HIM
RUNNING.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE GET SOME
MORE OF THE NONSENSE.
THE HILL SAYS, STILL, THE
DECISION BY SANDERS TO RUN
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IN
AS AN INDEPENDENT IS A SORE SPOT
FOR SOME DEMOCRATS.
THERE ARE ALSO CLINTON
SUPPORTERS WHO BELIEVE SANDERS
DESERVES SOME OF THE BLAME FOR
CLINTON'S LOSS TO TRUMP.
YOU KNOW WHO DESERVES A LITTLE
BIT MORE OF THE BLAME?
THOSE SAME CLINTON SUPPORTERS
WHO RAN HER CAMPAIGN AND
LOST TO DONALD TRUMP.
REMEMBER, BERNIE SANDERS DIDN'T
RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP,
HILLARY CLINTON DID.
YOU KNOW DESERVES THE BLAME?
HILLARY CLINTON.
EVAN BRING IT UP AND RUB IT IN,
SHE IS OFTEN THE WOODS.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HER ANYMORE,
BUT ALL THESE GUYS PUT OUT
ANONYMOUS HATCHET PIECES IN THE
PRESS, MAYBE BERNIE SANDERS
WAS THE ONE AT FAULT.
YOU RAN THE CAMPAIGN.
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO LOST TO
DONALD TRUMP.
WE TOLD YOU TO STEP ASIDE AND
YOU DIDN'T DIE INSTEAD YOU
SAID, NOBODY HAS TO STEP ASIDE.
HE IS A BETTER CHANCE OF WHEN HE
GETS FROM SO HE NEEDS TO STEP
ASIDE I NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO
EVERY POLL BERNIE SANDERS
DID BETTER AGAINST DONALD TRUMP
FOR ABOUT 100 POLES IN A ROLE
DIE REPORTED ALSO THEM ON THE
SHOW DURING THE PRIMARIES AND
EVERY PUNDIT WHO LOVED HILLARY
CLINTON, EVERY DEMOCRATIC
ESTABLISHMENT PERSON IS LIKE I
DON'T SEE THE POST ALL OF A
SUDDEN THEY TURNED REPUBLICAN
AND DIDN'T BELIEVE IN POLLS.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
YEAH, BUT I DO KNOW THAT SHE
DOES WORSE THEREBY ENDANGERING
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE
COUNTRY, BUT THEY DIDN'T LISTEN.
NOW HE IS THE MOST POPULAR GUY.
STILL, NO.
MAYBE IT WAS HIS FAULT.
THERE ALSO DEMOCRATS LOOKING
FOR FRESH FACES, SUCH AS
SENATOR, KAMALA HARRIS, THE
FRESHMAN CALIFORNIA SENATOR
WITH A GROWING NATIONAL
PRESENCE.
I HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT HER MUCH ON
THE SHOW.
I WANT TO BE FAIR TO HER AND DO
MORE RESEARCH BEFORE I COME TO
AN OPINION ON HER BUT LET'S JUST
SAY INTERNALLY HERE FOR A
LONG TIME I HAVE BEEN SAYING
THIS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS A
CANDIDATE AND IT IS KAMALA HARRIS.
LATER, AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE
NOTHING AGAINST HER.
IíLL DO
SOME RESEARCH AND FIND OUT, BUT
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW, MOST OF
THE DEMOCRATIC DONORS ARE LIKE
YES, KAMALA HARRIS.
SHE COULD BEAT BERNIE SANDERS.
I MEAN, SHE COULD BEAT ANYBODY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
NOW THEY ARE LOOKING FOR FRESH
FACES.
THAT IS FUNNY, I WAS STILL
JUST A YEAR AGO THAT NO, WE
DON'T GO WITH ANYONE WHO IS NEW.
WE GO WITH TRIED AND TRUE.
YOU GO WITH HILLARY CLINTON
BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN HERE
FOR DECADES.
YOU GO FOR THE PERSON THAT HAS
BEEN HERE FOR DECADES, THE
CLEAR LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY SO ANYONE WHO IS
CHALLENGING HER TO GET OUT OF
THE RACE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE HAVE A
LEADER IN THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY AND A LEADER IN THE POLLS
COUNTRYWIDE KEMAL ALL THIS
AND AVOID LOOKING FOR FRESH
FACES.
WHO WANTS TO PRIMARY?
WE'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO
ENTER THE PRIMARY.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID PRIMARIES
WERE BAD FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
ALL THE SUDDEN, ANYBODY TO BEAT
BERNIE SANDERS.
PLEASE, LET'S PRIMARY THE HELL
OUT OF THIS GUY.
BUT
YOU SAID IT WOULD HURT OUR
CANDIDATE WE PRIMARY PEOPLE.
LOOK AT THEIR RANK HYPOCRISY,
AND ALL OF THESE PAPERS, THEY
DRIVE ME CRAZY, AND ON TV AS
WELL, THEY JUST PRINTED WITHOUT
GIVING IT ANY THOUGHT; HEY, LOOK
AT THIS ANONYMOUS SOURCE
THAT SAID COME ALL HARRIS IS
GREAT AND WE NEED FRESH FACES.
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME A YEAR AGO
THAT WE DON'T NEED FRESH
FACES, AND WE'VE GOT TO GO
WITH ABEL IN THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY LIKE HILLARY CLINTON WHO
ARE THE ESTABLISHMENT?
WHAT HAPPENED TO FRESH FACES
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS
RUNNING?
ARE YOU A GOD DAMN LIAR?
OKAY, YOU ARE A REPORTER AND YOU
DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT?
AT LEAST POINT OUT THE
HYPOCRISY.
ANYWAY, AT LEAST ONE STRATEGIST
WHO WAS WILLING TO GO ON THE
RECORD, BRAD BANNON ñ
NOW, REMEMBER, DEMOCRATIC
CONSULTANTS, THEY GET RICH EVEN
IF DEMOCRATS LOSE.
EITHER WAY, THEY ARE HIRED.
AND, OO, TRUMP WON.
TRUMP WON.
YOU NEED EVEN MORE CONSULTANTS
TO RESIST.
BUT IF BERNIE SANDERS WINS, THEY
ARE OUT OF A JOB.
BRAD BRANDON SAYS, "WE FEEL WE
BE BETTER OFF IF WE STARTED
FROM SCRATCH AND RAN SOMEONE
COMPLETE THE NEW, BECAUSE
ARGUMENT FOR THAT.
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE IF YOU ARE
RUNNING AGAINST SOMEONE
LIKE FRONT, YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO
CAN RUN UNENCUMBERED AND
ISN'T PART OF THE USUAL CROWD."
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THAT'S WHAT WE SET A YEAR
AGO, AND YOU SAID, IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE HILLARY
CLINTON, WHO IS COMPLETELY
ENCUMBERED, AND IS THE USUAL
CROWD.
YOU TURNED AROUND RIGHT AWAY.
WE NEED SOMEONE UNENCUMBERED.
I JUST FOUND THAT OUT, BECAUSE
MY LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON IT.
I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE
CORRUPTION WE'VE GOT GOING
IN WASHINGTON ñ BERNIE WOULD
END IT ñ ALL OF A SUDDEN WE
NEED SOMEBODY UNENCUMBERED, AND
NOT PART OF THE USUAL CROWD.
BOY, THAT IS CONVENIENT, ISN'T
IT?
TOTAL AND UTTER NONSENSE.
THEY SEE BERNIE SANDERS COMING
LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.
A LOT OF US WHO SUPPORTED HIM
SAY, HELL YEAH, WHEN DO WE
GET ON BOARD?
FOR THOSE GUYS, THEY
THINK: OH NO!
ANYTHING BUT BERNIE SANDERS,
BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO AND
OUR CORRUPTION GRAVY TRAIN.
GOD DAMN RIGHT HE IS, AND THAT'S
WHY WE LIKE HIM, THAT'S WHY WE
BACK HIM, AND THAT'S WHY HE IS
THE MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN IN
THE COUNTRY, AND IF YOU ACTUALLY
CARED ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY, IF YOU ACTUALLY WANTED TO
RESIST DONALD TRUMP, YOU WOULD
BE PUTTING HATCHETS IN THE BACK
OF THE MOST POPULAR GUY IN THE
COUNTRY, WHO IS ON YOUR SIDE.
YOU WOULD BE HELPING HIM.
BUT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT RESISTING DONALD
TRUMP.
YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT BEATING
TRUMP.
THAT'S WHY YOU RAN A CANDIDATE
WHO WE TOLD YOU WAS
ENCUMBERED, AND HAD TERRIBLE
POLLING, BUT YOU RAN WITH
HER ANYWAY, BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO GET RICH OFF OF IT.
AND NOW THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS
ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO
RUN, YOU ARE SCARED TO DEATH
THAT HE IS GOING TO
OVERTURN YOUR APPLECART.
TO WHICH 
I SAY: CAN'T WAIT.
