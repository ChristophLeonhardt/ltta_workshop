1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,137
>> Martha: SO A WOMAN IS NOW

2
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:10,907
BEHIND BARS FOR LYING ABOUT

3
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:12,108
RAPE.

4
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:13,176
19-YEAR-OLD NICKY OVINO

5
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:15,478
CLAIMED SHE WAS RAPED IN 2016

6
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:18,081
BY TWO SACRED HEART UNIVERSITY

7
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:19,849
FOOTBALL PLAYERS BUT SHE THEN

8
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,651
ADMITTED SHE WAS LYING.

9
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:23,353
UNFORTUNATELY, SO MUCH OF THE

10
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:26,456
DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.

11
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:27,857
JONATHAN HUNT IS LIVE IN THE

12
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:28,958
WEST COAST NEWSROOM WITH THE

13
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:29,759
BACK STORY.

14
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,661
HI, JONATHAN.

15
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:32,395
>> GOOD EVENING.

16
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:33,563
JURY SELECTION WAS ALREADY

17
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:37,166
UNDERWAY IN THIS CASE WHAT

18
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:43,606
WHICH HAS IRREVABLY CHANGED

19
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:44,640
THE LIVES.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,143
THE ACCUSED WERE THE VICTIMS.

21
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:49,011
SHE CLAIMED TWO SACRED HEART

22
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,480
FOOTBALL PLAYERS PULLED HER IN

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,383
A BATHROOM AT A PARTY IN 2016

24
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:58,187
AND THEN TOOK TURNS RAPING

25
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:00,256
HER.

26
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,258
IN JANUARY HER LAWYER SAID SHE

27
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:03,659
WANTED CASE TRIED.

28
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,128
>> WE ARE READY TO GET A STORY

29
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:06,095
IN FRONT OF A JURY.

30
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:07,497
WE THINK THERE IS MORE TO THE

31
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:10,333
STORY THAN PORTRAYED IN THE

32
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:10,733
HEEDIA.

33
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,970
>> BUT THIS WEEK SHE ACCEPTED

34
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,471
A PLEA DEAL ADMITTING SHE MADE

35
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:18,674
UP THE ASSAULT ALLEGATION.

36
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,644
BECAUSE AS HER ARREST WARRANT

37
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,045
AFFIDAVIT STATED, "IT WAS THE

38
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,114
FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND

39
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:26,716
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE

40
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:28,384
ANOTHER MALE STUDENT AS A

41
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:30,253
FRIEND AND POTENTIAL

42
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:30,653
BOYFRIEND."

43
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:31,587
THE AFFIDAVIT SAID SHE

44
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:33,222
BELIEVED WHEN THE OTHER

45
00:01:33,222 --> 00:01:35,591
STUDENT, "HEARD THE

46
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,059
ALLEGATION, IT WOULD MAKE HIM

47
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:40,263
ANGRY AND SYMPATHETIC TO HER."

48
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:40,997
INVESTIGATORS SAID THE

49
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:42,698
FOOTBALL PLAYERS ADMITTED

50
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:43,900
HAVING SEX WITH HER BUT SAID

51
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,802
IT WAS CONSENSUAL.

52
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,003
THEIR ATTORNEY SAID THE PLEA

53
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,905
DEAL CANNOT MAKE UP FOR WHAT

54
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,940
SHE HAS PUT THE YOUNG MEN

55
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,075
THROUGH BUT THAT, "IT DOES

56
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:55,711
SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT

57
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,847
LYING ABOUT A SERIOUS INCIDENT

58
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,750
CARRIES SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES."

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,151
HER LAWYER SAID, "THIS WAS A

60
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,487
VERY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR

61
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:05,655
NICKY AND A SAD DAY FOR HER

62
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:07,056
AND HER FAMILY.

63
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:08,691
SHE WILL NOW BEGIN THE PROCESS

64
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:11,427
OF HEALING AND REHABILITATION

65
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:14,030
AS SHE AWAITS HER FINAL

66
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,564
SENTENCE."

67
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:17,200
UNDER THE PLEA BARGAIN, SHE

68
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,935
WILL BE FORMALLY SENTENCED

69
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:20,703
AUGUST 23 AND WILL SPEND ONE

70
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:27,743
YEAR IN PRISON.

71
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:28,611
>> Martha: REMARKABLE STORY.

72
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:32,281
WE HAVE THE LAWYER OF THE TWO

73
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,816
MEN WHO WERE FALSELY ACCUSED.

74
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,184
THEY ARE NOT NAMED.

75
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,419
ENOUGH DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE.

76
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,520
EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS KNOWS

77
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,920
ABOUT THEM.

78
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,989
WERE YOU SHOCKED SHE CAME

79
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:40,356
FORWARD?

80
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:41,624
YOU HAVE THE JURY AND YOU ARE

81
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:43,326
GOING TO TRIAL AND WHAT WAS

82
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:44,727
THE CATALYST?

83
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:45,661
>> SUDDENLY THE DAY CAME WHERE

84
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,063
I THINK SHE THOUGHT I'M GOING

85
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:48,698
TO SEE THE WHITES OF THE EYES

86
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:51,968
OF THIS JURY AND I JUST CAN'T

87
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,769
HANDLE IT.

88
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:54,904
IT WAS SURPRISED.

89
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:57,240
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO

90
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,607
TRIAL.

91
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,208
I THOUGHT SHE WANTED TO

92
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,409
PRESENT HER STORY, HER

93
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:01,744
MULTIPLE STORIES TO A JURY AND

94
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:02,778
SHE CHANGED HER MIND.

95
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:03,312
>> Martha: THIS IS

96
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:03,746
EXTRAORDINARY.

97
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:08,651
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

98
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,819
NATIONWIDE #MeToo MOVEMENT

99
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,954
WHERE WE ARE TOLD ALL WOMEN

100
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:12,488
SHOULD BE BELIEVED.

101
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,923
THAT IS THE ENVIRONMENT WE

102
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,024
LIVE IN RIGHT NOW.

103
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:16,325
IS THERE ANYTHING -- WHAT ARE

104
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:18,628
THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT

105
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:19,328
POTENTIALLY?

106
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,796
>> WELL, THE #MeToo MOVEMENT

107
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:23,266
IS A POWERFUL MOVEMENT.

108
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,568
HOW MANY YEARS WOMEN FOUGHT TO

109
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,469
HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD.

110
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,904
THIS DOES A TREMENDOUS

111
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:28,671
DISSERVICE TO THAT.

112
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:31,774
THIS NOW CAUSES SOMEONE TO,

113
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:35,411
THEY ADMITTEDLY LIED AND NOW

114
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,781
IT DOES SOIL WHAT WOULD BE

115
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:39,916
OTHERWISE VALID ALLEGATIONS.

116
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,418
THE EVIDENCE ENDED UP PROVING

117
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,786
THERE WASN'T A SEXUAL ASSAULT.

118
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,521
SHE LIED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

119
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,856
FIRST CLAIMING A SEXUAL

120
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:47,189
ASSAULT.

121
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:47,790
THEN NOT.

122
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,091
THEN BEING ASSAULTED.

123
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:49,625
THEN NOT.

124
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,860
IT DOES A COMPLETE DISSERVICE.

125
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,161
>> Martha: I FEEL FOR HER AS

126
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,263
WELL.

127
00:03:54,263 --> 00:03:55,531
OBVIOUSLY SHE HAS SOME ISSUES

128
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,199
SHE NEEDS TO WORK OUT.

129
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,834
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT

130
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:01,370
ON THE LIVES OF THE TWO YOUNG

131
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:01,771
MEN?

132
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:02,838
>> THEY ARE NO LONGER IN

133
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:03,172
SCHOOL.

134
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:05,775
THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE

135
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:06,709
OF THE SCHOOL ANYMORE.

136
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,077
THEY ARE IN THE WORKING WORLD

137
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:09,111
AND THEY ARE DOING THE BEST

138
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:09,712
THEY CAN.

139
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:12,214
THE ONE YEAR IN JAIL THAT SHE

140
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,250
IS SENTENCED TO PALES IN

141
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,318
COMPARISON TO THE 20 YEARS

142
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:16,786
THAT THE BOYS COULD HAVE

143
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:17,853
RECEIVED HAD THEY BEEN

144
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:19,555
ARRESTED AND HAD THEY BEEN

145
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:19,922
CONVICTED.

146
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:21,156
SO WHILE THE PUNISHMENT BY

147
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,159
SOME MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS

148
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,428
SEVERE, IT PALES IN COMPARISON

149
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:26,996
TO WHAT THE BOYS WERE FACING.

150
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:27,830
>> Martha: THEY CAN'T GO

151
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,698
BACK TO SCHOOL.

152
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:30,132
THEY CAN'T RESTART THEIR LIVES

153
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:31,100
WHERE THEY LEFT OFF.

154
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,801
>> THEY CAN.

155
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,736
THEY ARE CONSIDERING ALL OF

156
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:34,804
THEIR OPTIONS NOW.

157
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:37,673
THERE WILL BE A CIVIL SUIT

158
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:38,407
AGAINST NICKY MOST LIKELY AND

159
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:39,342
ALL THE OPTIONS ARE

160
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:39,742
CONSIDERED.

161
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,077
THEY ARE DOING AS WELL AS THEY

162
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:41,744
CAN RIGHT NOW.

163
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,212
>> Martha: AS YOU SAY, THESE

164
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:45,581
KIND OF ALLEGATIONS WHAT THEY

165
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,416
DO, THEY ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR

166
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,517
PEOPLE ACCUSED.

167
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:49,919
AND FOR ALL THE OTHER CASES

168
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,621
OUT THERE THAT ARE LEGITIMATE

169
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:52,888
#MeToo CASES WHERE THERE ARE

170
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:57,593
CASES OF ASSAULT.

171
00:04:57,593 --> 00:04:59,128
IT MUDDIES THE WATER IN A

172
00:04:59,128 --> 00:04:59,662
DANGEROUS WAY.

173
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:02,365
BUT IF YOU COME FORWARD WITH A

174
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,065
FALSE ALLEGATION YOU CAN END

175
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:04,133
UP IN JAIL.

176
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:04,934
>> YES, YOU CAN.

177
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,369
YOU CAN BE ARRESTED.

178
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:08,604
YOU CAN BE PUT IN JAIL AND YOU

179
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:09,505
CAN SUFFER CONSEQUENCES.

180
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:11,173
WHEN YOU LIE ABOUT A SERIOUS

181
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:16,379
INCIDENT IT CARRIES SERIOUS

182
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,079
CONSEQUENCES.

183
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,447
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE.

184
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:21,283
>> Martha: THINK OF DUKE,

185
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,918
AND THERE ARE REASONS WHY

186
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,053
PEOPLE LIE ABOUT THE

187
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:24,453
SITUATIONS.

188
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:25,855
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY

189
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,124
SINGLE CASE INDIVIDUALLY ON

190
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:28,724
ITS MERITS.

191
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:30,326
BOTH PEOPLE INVOLVED, RIGHT?

192
