11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,100
tends to be quite a pretty thing but

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,240
leaves are kind of annoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

13
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,680
were hazard and you slip over from you

Indian princesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> are something that I</font>

18
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,890
learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about an hour ago I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never did</font>

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,770
people I know where apparently Indian

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,329
princesses which apparently is like a

23
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,100
daddy-daughter thing and you go every

24
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,920

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,320
do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> blog I thought this was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explained</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lick with like a long inflatable thing</font>

28
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,809
and you jump in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you sometimes</font>

29
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,219
appropriate culture a little tiny bit

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">I didn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever do that many</font>

86
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,210
I still feel like I'm caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in this</font>

87
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,370
weird postgraduate world that is as

88
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,990
difficult as everyone told me it would

89
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">be I never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really believed that it was</font>

90
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,810
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that difficult but yeah I'm</font>

91
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">just trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep pushing myself and</font>

92
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,140
keep myself reading and keep myself

93
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,600
thinking and writing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these</font>

94
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,520
things and prying for jobs and just

95
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,170
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and meeting new people and just</font>

96
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,300
are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things at once</font>

97
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,040
it's just too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for you right now</font>

98
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,870
graduate life is great I mean there are

99
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,580
some great aspects but I love living in

100
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">this flat and it's really fun but it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

101
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,510
not without struggle i would say pasta

102
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,520
versus noodles two of my flatmates refer

103
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,400
to pasta as noodles piece of pana pasta

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,260
isn't a noodle my green<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster isn't a</font>

105
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,880
noodle I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why it frustrates</font>

106
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,120
me so much honestly these people I never

107
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,340
bless you<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24-hour supermarkets I like</font>

108
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,780
going the way back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and I</font>

109
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,340

everywhere it's a completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

114
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,380
spaces the space has been reinterpreted

115
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,540
by night time but there's a strange like

116
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,920
to knowing that you can go at any time

117
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be open cold</font>

radiator you have endless heat related

127
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,760
names possibly attached to my dislike

128
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,920
for being cold also because space heater

129
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,320
