1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,400
It’s obvious from just
looking at these women,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,210
how much work goes
into that job.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,660
Even just to audition for
these teams is really costly.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,940
I’m Amanda Hess and
I’m a critic at large

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,340
for the culture department
of The New York Times.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,850
I’ve also been reporting on
cheerleaders since 2011.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,730
Back in 2011, I wrote what
I think is the first story

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,650
about the underpayment
and treatment

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,150
of N.F.L. cheerleaders.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,950
But at the time I
wrote that, I actually

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,380
went on cable news
and the person

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,660
interviewing me said that he
found my story interesting,

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,630
but he thought I was the only
person who cared about it.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,590
So a lot has changed since then.

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,190
So the difference between
what was happening in 2014

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,530
and what’s happening
now is that initially

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,540
some cheerleaders in
a variety of teams

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,930
started suing for minimum wage.

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,600
They weren’t being
paid the minimum wage

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,480
when you factored in
everything from the practices

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,910
they were obligated to go to,
the games, calendar shoots.

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,190
Now the lawsuit
that has been filed

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,739
is a gender
discrimination lawsuit.

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,340
They are basically controlled
by the teams in ways

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,100
that male players are not.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,620
The teams were exerting
this huge amount

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,810
of control over their lives.

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,000
The Buffalo Jills were told
everything from how to fold

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,720
a napkin to how to
wash their genitals.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,830
Cheerleaders are, as a
rule, highly discouraged

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,900
from fraternizing
with players.

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,450
That can mean anything
from, you know,

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,200
talking to them at bars
to dating them.

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,460
Part of the problem with the
rules against cheerleaders

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,480
fraternizing not
just with players

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,180
but with other members
of the teams’ organizations

37
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,920
is that it makes it
difficult for them

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,440
to advocate for themselves,
to get a different job

39
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,240
with a company, you know,
later on

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:00:00,000
to use that position to get
something that’s actually paid.
