this is the man at the center of Republican attempts to discredit the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia FBI agent Peter struck he led the investigations into Hillary Clinton's email and potential Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and it is the text messages that he sent during that time that have led some Republicans to claim the Trump investigation is rigged and you got another text from your colleague Lisa page Trump's not ever gonna become president right right and you replied no no he's not we'll stop it that was written late at night off-the-cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero and my presumption based on that horrible disgusting behavior that the American population would not elect somebody demonstrating that behavior to be present in the United States his text was to Lisa Paige an FBI attorney who struck was allegedly having an affair with and one Republican congressman went there and I can't help but wonder when I see you looking there with a little smirk how many times did you look so innocent into your wife's eyes and lied to her about mr. chairman this is not normal not how things usually work in Congress you've been out of control since you've been on this committee why don't you leave it alone this is not Benghazi the reason my Republican colleagues will not let you answer a question is because they're not interested in your answers this is about promoting a narrative you are being your prop so they can promote a narrative in an ongoing effort to distract from the serious investigation of the special counsel that is closing in on the Trump inner circle for his part struck testified that he didn't like trout but it didn't impact the investigation in the summer of 2016 I was one of a handful of people who knew the details of Russian intellect Russian election interference and its possible connections with members of the Trump campaign this information had the potential to derail and quite possibly defeat mr. Trump but the thought of expressing that or exposing that information never crossed my mind you're asking us to believe that didn't stop Republicans from spending hours trying to discredit him and the Russian investigation as the hearings often broke down into partisan yelling matches not as to answer the rules suspend a sign of where things stand now are you just gonna make up rules as we go along patty contain al Jazeera Washington
