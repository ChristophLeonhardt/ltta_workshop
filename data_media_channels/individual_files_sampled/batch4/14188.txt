I have no doubt that the regulatory dysfunction that we just discussed was absolutely a contributor in to the decision of TransCanada to terminate this project and I wish that the federal government had at least acknowledged that they had culpability in how they allowed this Reese coping to occur and how that they're making the basic regulatory system evermore dysfunctional the question of whether TransCanada in its shippers we're going to still move forward to get a permit and hold it because you know we still don't know whether TMX is gonna get constructed frankly we don't know whether or not kxl is going to be constructed keeping energy East alive as an option was absolutely in the national interest and government should have been doing things to preserve that option because ultimately it's TransCanada and its shippers who really have to bear the option cost so you know my biggest issue here is that I wish the Trudeau government had acknowledged that it's it had culpability in this termination and that their handling of the regulatory process really by allowing it to be so dysfunctional was a material impact on the deliberations of TransCanada because I do feel they placed a very diminished probability that they could actually get an approval for a pipeline that frankly is you alluded to earlier it's kind of almost it built absolutely in the national interest and if producers and TransCanada who are the financial parties who bear the cost of over capacity if they wanted to build this pipeline you know that ought to have being their decision not made more difficult to justify by a dysfunctional regulatory process that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
