1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
and so where is this storm Maria
head/neck CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,069
has the answer what do we see
headed to the Turks and Caicos I believe

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,719
our polo sand of all is right there now
the storm is not done with the Dominican

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,100
Republic the North Shore which we
couldn't get anybody to because of the

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,820
storm was bearing down last night that's
where the damage is being done now

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,750
that's where the storm surge is that's
where the winds are right now from

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,320
Puerta platta all the way down on that
North Shore of Puerto Rico we're also

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,130
still seeing or Dominican Republic we're
also still seeing rainfall into Puerto

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,690
Rico proper can't tell you or show you
the radar because the radar still broken

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,440
in fact we just got a notice off of the
National Weather Service chat that they

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,460
may be two weeks before they can even
get to the radar because there are so

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,510
many trees down on the roadways and
obviously the radar is on as high a hill

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,390
as you can get they put it on top of a
mountain which is a good place for it

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,920
until you have to go fix it there is a
storm right now 115 miles per hour it is

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,079
a really big storm I wise about 50 miles
across think about how is about 10 miles

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,010
across when it hit Puerto Rico that
skater with their arms out or with the

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,080
arms in the arms are out right now and
it is forecast finally to turn to the

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,500
right away from the US we've been
watching this wiggle for the past couple

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:00:00,000
days those wiggle too much back to the
US so far so good today the answer is No
