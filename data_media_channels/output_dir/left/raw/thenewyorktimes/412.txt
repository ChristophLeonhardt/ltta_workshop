00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,250
These driverless electric cars
are in Masdar, a city built on

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,699
the outskirts of Abu Dhabi that prohibits
the use of combustion engine vehicles.

3
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,540
Ten years ago, the United Arab 
Emirates announced that

4
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,619
it would be the world's first city
with a net zero carbon footprint.

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,999
With an initial budget of 
around $20 billion,

6
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:41,400
Masdar was built with traditional 
terra-cotta designs and

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,069
high enough to capture the desert breeze.

8
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:49,069
Solar panels were supposed to
generate most of its energy supply,

9
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:52,110
but the plans for this oasis 
have been derailed due in part

10
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,110
to the 2008 global economic recession.

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,919
The completion date has been 
pushed from 2016 to 2030.

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,780
It was supposed to house 40,000
people, but today there are less

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,510
than 300 who call it home, 
most of them students.

14
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,870
Masdar’s development is continuing, 
but its planners have given up

15
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,610
on the original goal 
of being a carbon neutral city

16
00:01:18,610 --> 00:00:00,000
and are settling instead for 
being what they say is “low carbon.”
