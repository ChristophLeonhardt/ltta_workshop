PETE: WELCOME BACK WITH A FOX NEWS ALERT. WELL, AN ISLAMIST ARMED WITH A KNIFE GOES ON THE ATTACK IN PARIS, KILLING ONE AND INJURING FOUR OTHERS. ABBY: ISIS TAKING CREDIT FOR THAT ATTACK, AT LEAST THE 245th DEADLINE ONE SINCE 2015. ED: FORMER U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY LEADER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR NIGEL FARAGE JOINS US NOW TO WEIGH IN. GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU. ED: PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT A CALL FROM PRESIDENT MACARONI OF FRANCE BEFORE THIS HAPPEN, I MAKE JUST HOURS BEFORE THIS HAPPENED WHERE HE WAS SORT OF REGISTERING HIS COMPLAINT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT PULLING OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. AND THE MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WE'VE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT IRAN NUCLEAR THREAT, WE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT THE ISLAMIC TERROR THREAT AROUND THE WORLD, AND JUST HOURS LATER, LOOK AT THIS, ALL OVER AGAIN. HERE'S THE POINT, OF COURSE, THAT THE REGIME THERE IN TEHRAN, WHICH HAS BEEN THERE SINCE 1979 IS AN EXTREME RADICAL JIHADIST REGIME, AND THEY OF COURSE WANT TO SPREAD THEIR IDEOLOGY, NOT JUST TO THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD. SO ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO BRING THAT REGIME DOWN RATHER THAN PROP IT UP MUST, IT SEEMS TO ME, BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ED: NIGEL, INSIDE FRANCE, THOUGH YOU'VE GOT OVER 200 DEATHS AT THE HANDS OF ISIS IN 2015. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE? DO THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS AROUND THIS AT ALL? WELL, LOOK. THIS PARTICULAR ATTACK WAS CONDUCTED BY SOMEBODY WHO CAME TO FRANCE AS A CHILD REFUGEE, SO THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO SAY IS WHILST WE WANT TO BE COMPASSIONATE HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO WE GRANT REFUGEE STATUS TO, WHO WE LET INTO OUR COUNTRIES. BUT THE SECOND POINT, AND THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING, IS HE WAS ALREADY ON A SUSPECT LIST, HE WAS ON A LIST OF SOMEBODY WHO WAS A POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE FRENCH STATE. AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM: THERE ARE 40,000 PEOPLE IN FRANCE ON THAT SUSPECTED TERRORIST OR POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LIST. SO FRANCE HAS A MASSIVE PROBLEM, BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU INCREASE AND BOOST SECURITY, POLICING AND ALL THE REST OF IT, HOW ON EARTH DO YOU FOLLOW OR MONITOR 40,000 PEOPLE? SO THE ONE THING WE CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IS WE WILL SEE MORE OF THESE ATTACKS SEE MORE OF THESE ATTACKS. ABBY: YEAH. AND IT'S NOT JUST IN FRANCE. IT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AS WELL IT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AS WELL. IT'S RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AS WELL. THE BRIDGE I'M LOOKING BEHIND YOU HOW RECENTLY THAT ATTACK WAS YOU HOW RECENTLY THAT ATTACK WAS. AND THE KNIFE, THE STABBINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON IN LONDON, TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE AND THE POLICIES. YES. LET'S DRAW A DISTINCTION HERE, YOU KNOW, BETWEEN TERRORISM AND THE KNIFE ATTACKS. NOW, LONDON CRIME ITSELF, WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS A 44% INCREASE YEAR ON YEAR IN THE MURDER RATE GOING ON IN THIS CAPITAL. IT'S MOSTLY KNIFE CRIME. IT'S MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GANGS. IT IS MOSTLY BLACK ON BLACK CRIME, ALTHOUGH NOBODY HAS GOT THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT FOR FEAR OF BEING THOUGHT TO BE RACIST. AND OUR POLICE FORCE, WHICH USED TO, IN AREAS OF HIGH CRIME, CARRY OUT STOP AND SEARCH, IT WOULD STOP PEOPLE, FRISK THEM DOWN, SEE WHETHER THEY HAD KNIVES ON THEM. UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE EVEN BACKED AWAY FROM DOING THAT. AGAIN, FOR FEAR OF BEING CRITICIZED AS BEING RACIST. AND THE MAYOR OF LONDON, SADIQ KHAN, WHO SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP OR TELLING US WE SHOULDN'T EAT BURGERS AND OTHER POLITICALLY CORRECT THINGS. YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT THIS. OVER 60 PEOPLE KILLED IN THIS CAPITAL ALREADY THIS YEAR, AND THE MAYOR OF LONDON HAS NOT VISITED A SINGLE ONE OF THE CRIME SCENES AND HAS NOT SPOKEN TO ANY OF THE FAMILIES. AND I THINK, FRANKLY, WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO HERE WITH CRIME IN LONDON IS THE POLICE HAVE GOT TO GET TOUGHER, AND THE MAYOR NEEDS TO RETHINK HIS PRIORITIES. ED: YES. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS TWEET FROM THE MAYOR TO YOUR POINT: "CHILD OBESITY, A PROBLEM IN LONDON IN THE UNITED STATES. LONDON HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST OBESITY RATES IN EUROPE, 4% OF CHILDREN AGE 10 AND OVER ARE OVERWEIGHT. AS PART OF A NEW STRATEGY WE'RE BANNING HARMFUL JUNK FOOD ADS FROM THE LONDON NETWORK." NO MORE HAMBURGERS ON THE SUBWAY. ED: HE'S FOCUSING ON TRANSIT ADS FOR JUNK FOOD, NOT ON THE STABBING DEATHS? I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT IS ABOUT PRIORITIES, AND, AS I SAY, HE'S ALSO BUSY CRITICIZING DONALD TRUMP AND SAYING HE'S NOT WELCOME IN LONDON AND ALL THE REST OF IT, BUT HE'S NOT YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT GRIPPED IT. AND AGAIN YOU SEE, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH ISLAMIC TERRORISM IS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN FRIGHTENED OF DEALING WITH PROBLEMS WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AGAIN, IT'S THIS FEAR THAT IF YOU TACKLE A PROBLEM HEAD ON, YOU GET CALLED RACIST FOR DOING SO. WE'VE GOT TO BURY THIS RUBBISH. DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, ACTUALLY, ON CRIME IN LONDON THE BEGOT TOUGHER WITH THE OFFENDERS, IT'S BLACK LIVES WE'D SAVE. SO WE GOT TO CUT THIS NONSENSE, CUT THIS OFFENSIVE, AND WE GOT GET ON DOING THE JOB AND GIVING THE POLICE REAL POWERS. ABBY: THESE TERROR ATTACKS ARE A
