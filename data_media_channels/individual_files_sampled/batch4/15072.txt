Hillary Clinton contemplating a third run for president what it's not totally inconceivable but even Hollywood is not on board I'm gonna tell you all about that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel the Comedy Central TV show broad city is pretty popular I guess with hipsters and progressives to be fair the only thing that I have ever watched on Comedy Central I think was South Park and that's because South Park makes fun of everybody so I have literally never ever ever even heard of broad city but then again I am definitely not a hipster because let's see I shower I eat meat and I think the only benefit of Coachella is that it gets those dirty little hipster cockroaches out of my city Los Angeles for the weekend so of course with the near 100% progressive Democrat staffing of writers in this city it's no surprise that the show scored a celebrity cameo with Hillary Clinton herself back in 2016 of course Bernie Sanders supporters were hella pissed off about that but that's not actually what I'm here to talk about today basically they melted down like little snowflakes that they are but what is surprising is that the broad city stars don't think that Hillary Clinton should take another stab at the White House the stars of the show Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer sat down for an interview in DC with the hill and Jacobson said this I love Hillary I don't think she should run again it's like sad for me to say that I feel like we still very much need her to be involved in some way I don't know what that is I think that she still has a lot to do I totally agree you guys definitely need Hillary Clinton out there involved in campaigning for either herself or whoever the 2020 Democrat nominee is I agree Jacobson's co-star Ilana Glazer then said this we need a Democratic Socialist to run against President Donald Trump we need someone who hasn't been in the machine for this amount of time she was the most qualified candidate that ever ran but as far as branding the Democrats I think it needs to be Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren hell yes I would take either of them because these idiots these actor idiots actually think that fringe left candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris can win the national level unfortunately for them in reality there is literally no way in hell that America would ever vote for such progressive far-left candidates like Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker or any of those like them so I guess that means that literally no one wants Hillary Clinton to run again except Republicans we really really want that to happen third time's a charm Hillary go for it girl but the fact is most Democrats just want her to go away they want her to disappear into the night take her toys and just go home she's already caused enough embarrassment for her party but she seems to be a glutton for punishment the only thing that would make her repetitive third run for president better would be if she made Rosie O'Donnell her running mate hey you never know crazier things that happened thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative Ford the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rubble subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com and ahead for the rebel
