so speaking of college there is an excellent professor a law professor at Faulkner University named Adam McLean who insists that any student who uses the phrase I feel instead of I think must cluck like a chicken and if they use isms you know those is this is Amman that ISM or if they use vague trendy words like fair diversity etc they must immediately stop and explain what they think I noticed this in college to for comment we turn to every millennial okay like right now for example the Hayden's need to come to America but some people are all what about the strain on our resources and it's like when I had this garden party for my father's birthday right that is so profound that really changed the way I think about things you know like Alicia yeah you might have noticed this too if the language has changed now people don't say I think we're I believe all the time it's all bad but they'll you know I feel like it would be better if we do this I feel like this was kind of interesting why the change why do Millennials only use the phrase I feel I blame the public education system I also think that clucking like a chicken is not punishment enough because let's be honest drunk people do the chicken dance at weddings all across America yeah your cameras out of my apartment oh you just do them in your apartment wow I like prepping a dance for your wedding time entails in school but I I think that it is definitely something to do with what we see on TV what we what our generation has read in media what we you know romantic comedies even that like women are raised from seeing from the 80s and Beyond not that romantic comedies aren't amazing but it does kind of teach this and reinforce this belief that everything is about feeling versus facts like our buddy Ben says yeah for this Amanda she's just somewhere I think it might be a pinch tweet somewhere and and I think that that is really continued over and it's something that you see continually in the education system I mean I'm looking at schools right now for my four-year-old and every every single tour the two questions that are given the most time is the diversity question and what about the feelings of the students and I'm like no not what about the feelings of the students what are you gonna do to get my kid into Harvard you know a professor of mine in college had a theory on all of this he this guy Charles Hill he's a lifelong diplomat ambassador and his his idea was that over time students have become much more afraid just to make any statements of fact they're they're too afraid because they think that the facts can be offensive so you used to say the sky is blue and then you could say well I I think the sky is blue you know that's just my opinion and we still I believe the sky is blue because belief is a little a little more wish washy and then ultimately you get I feel like the sky's blue even the word like which we make fun of the valley girl well isn't it like this and that even though we're like is distancing yourself it's it's a simile you're not saying the thing is what it is you're saying it's like something else and that gives you a lot of wiggle room now Allie you are a conservative millennial I've read somewhere is it that Millennials are afraid of making statements of fact they seem hysterical in in many ways what what is going on here with the relationship of Millennials to objective truth I do think it's like you and you have both noted this kind of popularization of subjectivity and kind of shame about being objective and it's not just objectivity but we're so afraid of being judgemental the worst thing you can be after being a racist and a bigot at a homophobe is being judgmental so you see that anything is right or wrong especially if you're on the right um that you're not only a big but you are you know you're morally wrong and so I think it is in an effort to avoid being judgmental or being called a bigot or what have you and people start with I feel like or I think it's also something that you learn in like conflict resolution or if you go to like premarital counseling they always tell you to start with I feel because it takes the responsibility off of the person that you're talking to it's like I feel like you're being really rude I mean that's just my feeling but I feel like it um so I think that's trying to what we're going for we're so afraid of conflict we're so afraid of objectivity we're so afraid of being called a bigot or judgmental but if we're just starting with our own feelings you can't get mad at me for that it's kind of like so you no offense and you're actually being really great people only say that when they're being extremely offensive you know is it well no offense don't whatever you're gonna say don't say we've got to bless your heart I think it's also because people don't understand what an opinion is anymore we learn this incorrectly in schools that people think in an opinion is a preference so they think you know if I could say the sky is blue that's a fact I can say I think the sky is blue that's an opinion but it's a true opinion now if I say I like the blue sky or the blue sky sky pleases me I guess that's a preference I prefer cheese sandwiches to ham sandwiches that's a preference but just say I think and then a statement of fact that's an opinion but an opinion states fact now Jacob this is a very frustrating issue when you talk to Millennials about this they want conflict resolution just as Ali has said but sometimes you need to push you need to push arguments to their extreme to actually get to an answer to actually see the world clearly what is to blame for this why are Millennials so afraid of conflict is it is it the helicopter parenting is hit the anti-bullying campaigns why are we so afraid of getting MIDI and gritty in arguments with people I think it has to do with a pop culture honestly I mean even if you grew up in the 90s like I did and you had the greatest version of the Disney Channel original series you use every problem is solved in 20 minutes or less right and so whenever a problem goes beyond that 20 minute mark you're like where's I need a commercial break right now so I think that it has to do with I just want to resolve this quickly or it gets uncomfortable and just like and also has something to do with a tally said being judgmental we don't want to come off as judgmental even if we know we're right so when we say oh a bortion is murder and then a leftist says well that's judgmental you're judging someone you're like well I'm judging whether the fact that this person has life or not and if that life has intrinsic value and I think my judgment is correct and we just need a Millennials need to not be afraid especially conservative Millennials need to not be afraid to stand up and say look this might not be solved in twenty minutes or less we're just gonna have to work it out and get all the facts it is totally an example of politics following culture of the culture being so insidious in ways we can't recognize I hadn't even considered that and on the judge eNOS they don't be judgy don't be judgmental you hear this phrase sometimes now which is don't you um don't ya don't say that the thing I like is disgusting or something and the logical conclusion of this is what happened in the 20th century is a major movement among leftist intellectuals to normalize pedophilia and now obviously this is in the air with they say that Roy Moore I guess that wasn't pedophilia that was probably close to benefits a fee Buffy Lee as post-pubescent girls but nevertheless girls who were too young to be having sex with and you're picking them up there was this movement to normalize all of that and we should yuck that YUM if somebody finds that yummy let's yuck it man we can't we can't have too much of that
