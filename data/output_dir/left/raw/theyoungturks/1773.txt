1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,530
THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER CELEBRATES

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,910
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF
THE PRESS, AND IT IS GETTING

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,870
SOME BAD PRESS FOR A FREE SPEECH
PERFORMED BY MICHELLE WOLF.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,870
NOW,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,180
A LOT OF JOURNALISTS THAT WERE
PRESENT AT THE DINNER THINK THAT

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,250
SHE WENT TOO FAR, AND SOME OF
HER BOLDEST JOKES HAD TO DO WITH

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,040
ABORTION, SHE SAID --

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,040
>>

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:42,670
>>OKAY.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,510
ALSO SHE TOOK AIM AT
KELLYANNE CONWAY, SAYING --

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,510
>>

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,600
>>[BUFFERING]

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
>>

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:02,879
>> THIS TIME DON'T BE SUCH A
LITTLE BITCH, JIM ACOSTA.

15
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:20,659
>>I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SARAH.

16
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:25,880
I THINK SHE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:02:09,038
LIKE, SHE BURNS FACTS AND THEN
SHE USES THAT ASH TO 

18
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,038
CREATE A

19
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,340
PERFECT SMOKY EYE.

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,760
LIKE, MAYBE
SHE'S BORED WITH IT, MAYBE IT'S

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
LIES.

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,530
IT'S PROBABLY LIES.

23
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,400
AND
I'M NEVER REALLY SURE WHAT TO

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,269
CALL SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, YOU
KNOW WHAT LOVE ISN'T SARAH

25
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,780
SANDERS, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS,
COUSIN HUCKABEE, AUNTIE HUCKABEE

26
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,780
SANDERS.

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,840
LIKE, WHAT'S UNCLE TOM
BUT FOR WHITE WOMEN WHO

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,989
DISAPPOINT OTHER WHITE WOMEN?

29
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,040
OH, I KNOW.

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,069
AUNT COULTER.

31
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,189
>> SO THAT WAS A LITTLE SCATHING
TO SAY THE LEAST, MANY ARE UPSET

32
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,230
THAT SHE WENT AFTER SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS' LOOKS, SHE

33
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,491
WENT AFTER THE COMMENTS ABOUT
HER BEING A SOFTBALL COACH, AUNT

34
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:57,860
LYDIA FROM THE HANDMAIDS TALE,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET

35
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,400
ABOUT SMOKY EYE COMMENT, EVEN
TOMI LAHREN SAID IT WAS AWFUL

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,019
SHE TOOK AIM AT A WOMAN THAT
WAY, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS

37
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,549
ACTUALLY A FEMINIST, APPARENTLY
IS, BUT SARAH'S DAD WAS THE MOST

38
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,170
UPSET AT THIS COMMENTARY.

39
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,170
HE
SAID --

40
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,170
>>

41
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:31,719
>> ESSENTIALLY HE'S 

42
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,580
EQUATING
WHAT MICHELLE WOLF HAD TO SAY

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,239
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER WITH HATE
SPEECH, WHICH IS A FALSE

44
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,239
EQUIVALENT THERE.

45
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,809
HE ALSO SAID
--

46
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:40,809
>>

47
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:53,269
>>IT'S ABSURD AND SEXIST WHY HE
SAYS YOUNG FEMALE BUT THAT'S

48
00:03:53,269 --> 00:04:02,319
BESIDE THE POINT --

49
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,319
>>

50
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,319
>> GO FOR IT.

51
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,319
>>IS THAT A P.C.

52
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,319
WAY OF SAYING
KILL YOURSELF?

53
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,319
BECAUSE PRIDE

54
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,319
PODS ARE DANGEROUS.

55
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,739
>> I THINK WHAT HE'S SAYING IS
WASH OUT YOUR MOUTH BECAUSE IT'S

56
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,999
VULGAR.

57
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:17,779
BUT THE INTERESTING PART
ABOUT THIS IS THAT HE'S SO

58
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,578
AGAINST THIS VERBAL BULLYING,
ESPECIALLY AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER

59
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,729
WHO WAS A WOMAN.

60
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,130
AND IT'S LIKE,
OKAY, BUT YOU ARE DEFENDING

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,580
DONALD TRUMP WHO VERBALLY
BELIEVES WOMEN ON A DAILY BASIS.

62
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,970
HE CALLS THEM PIGS, DOGS, SAYS
THEY HAVE BLOOD COMING OUT OF

63
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,730
WHATEVER -- I'M NOT SAYING
EITHER ARE RIGHT BUT IT'S ONE OF

64
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,229
THE OTHER, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

65
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,050
AND THIS COMES RIGHT AFTER HE

66
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,000
REALLY STOOD UP AGAINST P.C.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
CULTURE.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HE SAID PEOPLE

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,470
SHOULDN'T WATCH HIS SHOW IF YOU
ARE EASILY OFFENDED, AND WARNED

70
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,599
THEM NOT TO TUNE IN BECAUSE THEY
WILL GET TRIGGERED AND NEED A

71
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,850
PONY, POPSICLE, AND PLAY-DOH TO
COPE.

72
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,340
SO WHAT HE SAYS IS OKAY,

73
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,260
BUT WHATEVER A COMEDIAN SAYS
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ABOUT HIS

74
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,370
ADMINISTRATION, IS NOT OKAY.

75
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,610
>>A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT A
PROBLEM UNLESS IT AFFECTS YOU,

76
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,900
SO I GUESS THAT'S THE
PUNISHMENT, IF THAT'S HOW YOU

77
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,711
HANDLE SOMETHING THAT TRIGGERS
YOU THEN DON'T WATCH IT, IT

78
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:23,750
SEEMS PRETTY EASY TO NOT WATCH
IT. IS IT FREE-SPEECH OR IS IT

79
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,839
FREE SPEECH, IS WHAT IT COMES
DOWN TO.

80
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,789
>> OF COURSE YOU ARE RIGHT.

81
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,039
YOU
CAN'T BE SURPRISED THAT MIKE

82
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,979
HUCKABEE COMES TO THE RESCUE OF
SARAH HUCKABEE, I MEAN, IF YOU

83
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,169
DIDN'T DO THAT I'M SURE HE
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH

84
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,169
HIMSELF.

85
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,449
ON THE OTHER HAND HE'S
A TOTAL HYPOCRITE, HE'S A

86
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,789
HYPOCRITE AND SO MANY OTHER WAYS
BEYOND THIS ONE, BUT YES HE'S

87
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:45,729
CONSTANTLY MAKING FUN OF LIBERAL
SNOWFLAKES AND HOW WE GET

88
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,660
TRIGGERED BY THINGS, AND THEN OF
COURSE HE'S SUPER TRIGGERED BY

89
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,169
WHAT WENT DOWN AT THE WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER.

90
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,039
AGAIN HIS DEFENSE OF HIS
DAUGHTER I CAN COMPLETELY

91
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,039
UNDERSTAND.

92
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,860
>>I HOPE MY DAD WOULD DEFEND ME
IF SOMEONE WENT AFTER ME.

93
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,949
>>I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR DOING
THAT.

94
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,550
>>I FEEL LIKE IF I SHOWED UP TO
PARTICIPATE IN A ROASTED

95
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,919
SOMEONE ROASTED BE I DON'T THINK
MY MOM WOULD FLIP OUT ABOUT IT.

96
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,730
>>MY MOM ROASTS ME, BUT IF
SOMEBODY ROASTED ME SHE WOULD BE

97
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,730
LIKE, THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

98
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,940
THERE'S THAT DISTINCTION WHEN IT

99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,629
COMES TO PARENTAL PROTECTION.

100
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,849
>> DO YOU SIGN UP FOR THOUGH BY
SHOWING UP?

101
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,330
>> I THINK IT'S GREAT SHE SHOWED
UP, I THINK IT'S A GOOD SPORT

102
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,670
THAT SHE SHOWED UP.

103
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,849
HERE IS
WHERE I STAND ON THIS, I THINK A

104
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:33,460
LOT OF MICHELLE WOLF'S JOKES
WERE EDGY.

105
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
THEY WERE DEFINITELY

106
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,150
EDGY, SHE PUSHED THE ENVELOPE.

107
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,150
>> WERE ANY OUT OF BOUNDS?

108
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,190
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

109
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,780
I DON'T
PERSONALLY CONDONE ANY SORT OF

110
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,599
JOKES OR SHAMING ABOUT
SOMEBODY'S WEIGHT OR THEIR LOOKS

111
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,580
OR THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK
EVEN WHEN PEOPLE GO AFTER DONALD

112
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,879
TRUMP'S APPEARANCE THAT KIND OF
RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY, BUT YOU

113
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,750
ARE FREE TO DO SO.

114
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,560
>> BUT DID SHE GO AFTER THAT?

115
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION.

116
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,139
>>I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING
IS THAT SHE DID THAT WITH THE

117
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,500
SOFTBALL AND AUNT LYDIA.

118
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
>> IS THAT OUT OF BOUNDS?

119
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,080
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS, I JUST
DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY.

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,080
>>IS SHE SAYING SOFTBALL COACHES
ARE UNATTRACTIVE?

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,509
I THINK IT'S

122
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:19,819
MORE A JOKE ON HOW SHE
AGGRESSIVELY YELLS OUT

123
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,009
REPORTERS' NAMES AND DOLES OUT
WHO GETS TO TALK.

124
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,129
>>THAT'S HOW I TOOK IT TOO.

125
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:29,730
>> BUT THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT
AS SAYING YOU ARE A WOMAN WHO

126
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,190
WAS PUSHING THESE MISOGYNISTIC
POLICIES TO THE PEOPLE, WHICH IS

127
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:42,360
WHAT AUNT LYDIA DOES ON THE
HANDMAIDS TALE.

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:50,979
>> AND I 
GUESS THE CLAP BACKS

129
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,100
SHE'S GETTING IN RESPONSE TO

130
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,230
THIS HAS TO DO WITH HER SMOKY
EYE COMMENT, RIGHT?

131
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,230
AND SHE

132
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,039
LITERALLY IS COMPLEMENT IN HER
SMOKY EYE.

133
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,039
SARAH HUCKABEE

134
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,159
SANDERS HAS GREAT MAKEUP, AND
SHE'S LITERALLY COMPLEMENTING

135
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,260
THAT BUT ALSO SAYING IT'S FROM
ASHES FROM THE BURN FACTS

136
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,889
THAT YOU PRESENT.

137
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,880
>>TO BE FAIR IT'S TOUGH TO PULL
A COMPLEMENT OUT OF THAT LITTLE

138
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
RUN.

139
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,419
>> SHE'S CLAIMING IT'S A
COMPLEMENT.

140
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:27,639
>> I LOVE CLUB COMEDY, EDGY
COMEDY, BUT THIS IDEA THAT IT'S

141
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,830
BECOME A ROAST WHERE YOU CAN
JUST BLOW TORCH EVERYBODY IN THE

142
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,250
ROOM, MAYBE IT'S GONNA LITTLE
TOO FAR.

143
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,270
>> YOU THINK SHE WENT TOO FAR?

144
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,270
>>I DO.

145
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,840
LOOK, FIRST OF ALL I
LOVE HER MATERIAL, I THOUGHT IT

146
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,880
WAS REALLY FUNNY, LAUGH OUT LOUD
FUNNY, BUT IF IT WERE UP TO ME I

147
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,240
WOULD'VE PULLED A LITTLE OF THAT
ABORTION STUFF OUT, I THOUGHT IT

148
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
WAS ROUGH.

149
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,661
YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR
ROOM A LITTLE BIT. AND IF YOU

150
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,520
SAY NO, MARK, THE ROOM IS THE
USA.

151
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,260
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT

152
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,520
PLAYING THAT ROOM THERE.

153
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,340
AND
HAVING GENERAL RESPECT FOR

154
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,630
SENSIBILITIES.

155
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,420
BUT DON'T
MISUNDERSTAND ME, I LOVED HER

156
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,600
STUFF, I THOUGHT IT WAS EDGY AND
THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL GET WHEN

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,270
YOU HIRE THAT KIND OF COMIC.

158
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,900
BUT
MORE FUNDAMENTALLY THIS WHITE

159
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,330
HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER IS
CRAP.

160
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,330
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD

161
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,490
IT, I'VE ALWAYS SAID IT, IT'S
WAY TOO COZY, IT'S A CELEBRATION

162
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,180
OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT, IF IT'S
JOURNALISM THEY SHOULD TAKE A

163
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,110
MINUTE AND TALK ABOUT WHERE
JOURNALISM HAS GONE.

164
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,110
THERE ARE A

165
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,350
HANDFUL OF OUTFITS THAT ARE
STILL DOING JOURNALISM, BUT MOST

166
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,400
OF IT IS DOING INTENSE
DISCUSSION SPEECH, LIKE CNN AND

167
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,420
FOX NEWS AND MS AND ALL THE
REST, AND THE REAL INVESTIGATIVE

168
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,090
STUFF IS BEING DONE HERE AT TYT
BUT ALSO IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT

169
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,060
PRINT AREAS ACROSS THE INTERNET.

170
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,230
SO I DON'T SEE THEM AS

171
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,350
JOURNALISTS ANYMORE, I SEE THEM
AS CELEBRITIES WHO ARE ALL GOING

172
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,270
DOWN ON EACH OTHER ON THIS NIGHT
OF THE WHITE HOUSE

173
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,270
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER.

174
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,130
SO THE
WHOLE THING IS GARBAGE, AND

175
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,210
THEY'VE GOTTEN SO INTO THESE
STUNT BOOKINGS OF COMICS WHO ARE

176
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,350
THEN SO EDGY, AND THEN
AFTERWARDS EVERYBODY IS

177
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,360
CLUTCHING THEIR PEARLS GOING,
WITH JIMMY KIMMEL TOO DIFFICULT

178
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
TO TAKE?

179
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,030
WAS STEPHEN COLBERT TOO
IN THE FACE OF GEORGE BUSH?

180
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,030
IT'S

181
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,830
WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU HIRE THAT
KIND OF COMIC.

182
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,570
>> THE ENTIRE NIGHT IS SUPPOSED
TO SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

183
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,610
JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS,
RIGHT?

184
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,090
AND THEN THEY ARE TRYING

185
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,030
TO -- THEY WERE UPSET
ESSENTIALLY BY THIS BECAUSE THEY

186
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,340
ARE STILL TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND
THIS CLOAK OF IMPARTIALITY, AND

187
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,390
THEY AREN'T. AREN'T IMPARTIAL,
THEY AREN'T UNBIASED, THAT'S

188
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,390
IMPOSSIBLE.

189
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,740
BUT THEY ARE STILL
TRYING TO SAY WE ARE A NEUTRAL

190
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:47,240
JOURNALIST, BUT THEY START TO
GET UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE

191
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,550
THROUGH THEIR REPORTING AND
SENSATIONALISM THEY HAVE

192
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,710
COMPLETELY NORMALIZED SOME OF
THE BEHAVIOR AND THE THINGS

193
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,350
GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND
SHE EVEN CALLED THEM OUT ON

194
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,350
THAT.

195
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,731
SHE SAYS YOU HAVE ENABLED
AND CREATED THIS MONSTER, YOU

196
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:04,440
ARE PERPETUATING THIS, IT'S YOUR
FAULT.

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO

198
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,710
HEAR THAT, THEY AREN'T SELF
REFLECTIVE, BUT I THINK THAT IS

199
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,270
WHAT THEY ARE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH AND I THINK WHAT THEY DID

200
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,230
IS USE MICHELLE WOLF AS A
SCAPEGOAT.

201
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,410
>> IT WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT CHUMMING UP AND SHOWING

202
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,930
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
SUBJECTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO

203
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,930
COVER THE SUBJECTS, IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A DINNER TO

204
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,090
CELEBRATE THESE JOURNALISTS WHO
DO THE HARD WORK.

205
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,090
AND I THINK

206
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,790
THE REASON THE TIMES, THE NEW
YORK TIMES, THEY DON'T

207
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,490
PARTICIPATE IN THIS ANYMORE
BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME KIND OF

208
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,250
THIS CELEBRATION THAT SHOWS YOU
PARTYING AND CHUMMING UP TO THE

209
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,320
PEOPLE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE.

210
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,190
IS IT

211
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,270
FREE SPEECH OR IS IT FREE
SPEECH?

212
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,870
SO IS THIS GOING TO FAR?

213
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,920
THESE HARD NEWS OPERATIONS HAVE
ALL THESE PAYOLA RULES AND YOU

214
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,860
CAN'T EVEN ACCEPT GIFTS FROM
PEOPLE YOU COVER BUT THEN YOU

215
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,100
HAVE A MASSIVE NBC PARTY THAT
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS AT

216
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,410
AFTER THIS WHEN SHE WAS SO
UPSET.

217
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,600
IS THAT OKAY?

218
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,210
>> BUT THAT'S THE THING, THEY
ARE TRYING TO -- I'VE BEEN TO

219
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,010
THE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER AND
WHAT HAPPENS IS IN THIS ROOM

220
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,610
BEFORE THE DINNER THEY ALL ARE
IN THE SAME ROOM, ALL OF THE

221
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,630
JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS,
THEY ARE ALL SCHMOOZING, BECAUSE

222
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,990
WHAT THESE JOURNALISTS WANT IS
ACCESS.

223
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,950
>> AND IS THAT APPROPRIATE?

224
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,450
>>LOOK, JOURNALISM IN WASHINGTON
DOES INVOLVE CHUMMING AROUND,

225
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,010
AND JOURNALISM IN WASHINGTON
DOES INVOLVE GOING FOR A DRINK

226
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,450
OR DINNER WITH A SOURCE OR MAYBE
EVEN A HIGH-PROFILE POLITICAL

227
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,450
FIGURE.

228
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,200
SO THERE IS CHUMMING
GOING ON ALREADY, WE KNOW THAT,

229
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,300
THAT'S HOW TO GET A SOURCE TO
OPEN UP, THAT'S THE WAY TO GET

230
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,590
AN INSIDE TRACK ON CERTAIN
STORIES.

231
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,020
HAVING SAID THAT, IT'S

232
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,130
GROSSLY PERVERTED IN THIS
PROCESS OF THE WHITE HOUSE

233
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,130
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER.

234
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,800
IT HAS
BECOME SOME SORT OF OSCARS TYPE

235
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,390
THING WHERE YOU SIT THERE AND
THE NEXT DAY YOU DO THIS

236
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,560
POSTMORTEM ON THE HOST.

237
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,970
FORGET
IT, SCRAP THE HOST, GET BACK TO

238
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,050
JOURNALISM, AND YOU GUYS SHOULD
CELEBRATE REAL JOURNALISTS AND

239
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,730
THE WORK THEY STILL DO, THOSE
WHO ARE STILL DOING IT, AND THEN

240
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,010
IT SHOULD ALL GO TO THE
SCHOLARSHIP FUND OR THOSE THINGS

241
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,050
ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORTING
JOURNALISM AND FREE SPEECH AND

242
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,450
THE MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY.

243
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,270
BUT
WE'VE GOTTEN WAY OFF TRACK WITH

244
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,910
THIS, AS I SAY COME OF THIS
CELEBRATION OF EACH OTHER, IT'S

245
00:13:14,910 --> 00:00:00,000
A SELF-CONGRATULATORY LOAD OF
CRAP.
