THINK HE MADE CONTACT. Trace: HE MAY HAVE. JOHN ROBERTS, THANK YOU. I WANT TO BRING IN FOX NEWS SUNDAY ANCHOR CHRIS WALLACE. GET THE TONE GOING ON THIS, GET YOUR OPINION, CHRIS. REALLY, YOU LOOK AT MACRON, HE CAME IN, GOT THE STATE DINNER, THE PAT ON THE BACK, THE HUG. AND ANGELA MERKEL COMES IN AND GETS REALLY A HANDSHAKE AND A SANDWICH AND THAT'S IT. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? I'M SURE IT WAS A NICE SANDWICH. THE WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN IS DELICIOUS. YEAH, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS A CLOSER PERSONAL RELATION. WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT THIS ONE-TWO PUNCH BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, FIRST MACRON, THEN MERKEL, IS THAT THEY SEEM TO BE GIVING UP A LOT AND THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT. REMEMBER WHEN THIS WHOLE THING STARTED THERE WAS TALK FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, IT'S THE IRAN DEAL OR NOTHING. AND NOW, BECAUSE OF THE HARD LINE THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE TAKING, WHETHER IT'S MACRON OR MERKEL, THEY SEEM TO BE SAYING IT'S GOING TO BE THE IRAN DEAL PLUS. AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE IRAN DEAL PLUS, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDING A SUNSET CLAUSE THEY'RE TAKING OUT THE SUNSET CLAUSE. THE CURRENT AGREEMENT, ONLY GOES TO 2025. THEN BASICALLY, IRAN CAN DO WHATEVER IT WANTS IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT THAT. THEY SEEM TO BE SAYING, THAT'S OKAY WITH US. THEY ALSO WANT TO HAVE NEW LIMITS ON BALLISTIC MISSILES AND ALSO SOME KIND OF A STATEMENT ABOUT REGIONAL TROUBLEMAKING BY IRAN. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A TREATY, IT'S JUST AN AGREEMENT, REMEMBER IT WAS NEVER SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS, WHAT YOU COULD GET IS NOT ANY SIGN-ON BY IRAN OR ITS ALLIES AND RUSSIA OR CHINA. BUT YOU COULD GET THE EUROPEANS AND THE U.S. SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO ADD THESE THREE CONDITIONS AND IF YOU VIOLATE ANY OF THOSE THEN WE'RE GOING TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS. THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO KEEP THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL BUT ALSO ADD OTHER THINGS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS AND THOSE OTHER ISSUES. Trace: YEAH, SO THE IRAN DEAL IS KIND OF UP IN THE AIR. BUT YOU GO TO NORTH KOREA THING AND YOU LOOK AT KIM JONG-UN MEETING WITH MOON JAE-IN ON THE SOUTH CROW AN SIDE OF THE PENINSULA. IT'S AMAZING SOUTH SIDE OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. EVEN IF THIS THING ERUPTS IN TEN MINUTES, IT COULD, FOR THIS MINUTE IT LOOKS LIKE TRUMP REALLY IS KIND OF THE PEACEMAKER IN THIS WHOLE BARGAIN. I DON'T KNOW I'D CALL HIM THE PEACEMAKER. I WOULD SAY THAT HE HAS BEEN THE MOTIVATING FORCE IN GETTING KIM TO LAUNCH THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE. CLEARLY, A LOT OF US WONDERED ABOUT IT, CLEARLY THE COMBINATION OF THREATS, RAINING FIRE AND FURY ON NORTH CAROLINA, INSULTS, LITTLE ROCKETMAN, MY NUCLEAR BUTTON IS BIGGER THAN YOURS. UNCONVENTIONAL BUT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED MAXIMUM PRESSURE, TIGHTENING THE SCREWS IN TERMS OF TRADE AND EXPORTS AND IMPORTS THAT ALL OF THAT HAS AN IMPACT. I PROMISE KIM HAS NOT DECIDED TO SUDDENLY PLAY NICE WITH SOUTH KOREA OR POTENTIALLY THE U.S. BECAUSE HE HAS HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. HE HAS HAD A CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCE. AND HE NOW FEELS ENOUGH PRESSURE THAT HE FEELS HE HAS TO CHANGE WHAT HIS PLAN IS. HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT, AND YOUR SKEPTICISM OR AT LEAST CAUTION IS WELL WARRANTED. PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD HIS SECRETARY OF STATE MADELINE ALBRIGHT MEET WITH KIM'S FATHER IN THE '90s, THEY MADE A DEAL, THE NORTH KOREANS BROKE THAT. THE SOUTH KOREANS AND THE NORTH CROW ANS HAVE MADE DEALS IN THE PAST, NORTH CROW ANS HAVE BROKEN THOSE AS WELL. THE KEY TO MY DAYS COVERING RONALD REAGAN, TRUST BUT VERIFY. YOU WANT TO ACCEPT AGREEMENTS BUT YOU GOT TO VERIFY THEY'LL KEEP THEIR WORD. Trace: AND GOES BACK TO 2008 WHERE THEY SAID THE SAME THING, WE'LL PULL BACK THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, GET RID OF THEM, THEN THAT LASTED ABOUT A CUP OF COFFEE. PUSHES US FORWARD, CHRIS, TO THIS SUMMIT BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN. THIS IS NOW PIVOTAL, WHEREVER IT HAPPENS, IN SINGAPORE OR IN SWEDEN, THIS THING REALLY IS VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT REITERATED TODAY, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED LIKE A FIDDLE. AND, TWO, HE SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE'S KIND OF GOT THIS THING. WELL, WE'LL SEE IF HE'S GOT THIS THING. HE CERTAINLY IS EXPRESSING GREAT REQUEST AS HE DOES BUT IT TAKES TWO TO MAKE A DEAL. THE KEY HERE IS GOING TO BE WHAT DOES DENUCLEARIZATION MEAN. AND THE SEQUENCING. DENUCLEARIZATION TO THE U.S. MEANS YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING, ALL OF YOUR NUKES, ALL OF THE FACILITY TO MAKE NUCLEAR FUEL AND WEAPONS, GIVE UP YOUR BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM AND SHIP IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY OR WE SEE YOU HAVE DESTROYED IT. THE SENSE ONE GETS FROM REPORTING OUT OF NORTH KOREA IS THAT THEY'RE THINKING MORE OF THE DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS FREEZE IN PLACE. YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT US AS A NUCLEAR POWER BUT WE WON'T ADVANCE OUR PROGRAM OR DO MORE TESTING. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE PRESIDENT ACCEPTS THAT. THE OTHER QUESTION, SEQUENCING. IS IT THAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE TO GO FIRST AND DO EVERYTHING AND THEN THE U.S. LIFTS SANCTIONS? I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR THE NORTH KOREANS TO ACCEPT. THEY MAY SAY WE'LL TAKE STEP A AND YOU LIFT SANCTIONS, WE TAKE STEP B, YOU LIFT MORE SANCTIONS. THIS QUESTION OF WHAT THE SOUTH KOREANS CALL ACTION FOR ACTION, DO YOU THIS AND WE RESPOND, I
