I would say you want to clean your water bottle as often as you would clean your drinking glass or your coffee cup so when you're at home typically after I mean for me I use a glass or a cup for a day and then I would wash it so I would recommend if you're walking around with a water bottle try to give it a rinse once a day well you want to soak those in vinegar and you can soak them overnight that can help get rid of the mold or any of the the odors or anything like that and if you do notice odors in any of your water bottle accessories you can actually soak them in plain baking soda and you do that for even a couple of hours or even overnight if you notice it's a really strong odor and the baking soda will help remove that odor give it a good rinse or else it'll taste really salty when you go to have another sip and you won't notice any odors anymore
