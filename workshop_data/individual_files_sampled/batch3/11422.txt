three Giants of social media have been grilled by a panel of UK lawmakers over allegations of Russian interference on their platforms during the brexit vote but there's been little if anything to back up those allegations we looked at all advertisements with any connection to Russia and and we found no evidence of our services being used to interfere in the referendum a very small number of suspected internet research agency linked accounts 49 such accounts were active during the referendum campaign which represents less than naught point naught 5 percent of the total number of accounts that these are very low levels of engagement until we've completed this investigation we won't know but what we haven't had is information that's enabled us to target on a particular page or a particular phenomenon despite all their commitment enthusiasm and hard work spanning over a period of really several months when this inquiry kick started it seems like the UK parliamentary committee that's trying to find out the truth about Russia and any brexit meddling they seem to be really hitting a brick wall this week they traveled all the way to Washington thousands thousands of miles presumably having spent thousands of pounds to get there and what they ended up with while questioning the executives of Twitter YouTube and Facebook was just a frustration it seems and that was thick in the atmosphere investigated journalism for instance it is it led to suggestion that there are lots of campaigns going at work you haven't looked happier that's the thing you haven't looked mr. Khan is going on Renault Hara well it seems who did look was Twitter and what they said they found was that there were only 49 accounts connected to Russia during the time of the brexit referendum again I'm no mathematician so correct me if I'm wrong perhaps but it seems that there's this is really nothing to write home about given that twitter has hundreds of millions of accounts and despite the chair of this committee damien collins saying that his quote instinct tells him that the numbers should be higher that did not turn out to be the case so despite this ghost-chasing continuing and the committee keeping asking the executives to look harder it seems no fruitful results so far much of the media has seemingly been hungry for a scandal which the Russia investigation is failing to provide because some of the headlines this one says Twitter has finally conceded that Russian accounts tried to influence brexit and only small letters in the Basara explained that the story is about a few dozen accounts the same with The Times headline which admits the existence of so-called Russia trolls only the first paragraph reveals there were only 49 such suspicious accounts one more example here you need to look even deeper to dig actual numbers out of a lengthy article well we're now joined by radio host John gone to discuss this further now thanks for coming on the program mr. gone - now first of all do you think readers want speculation on the Russia investigation instead of real facts in their newspapers nothing people want real facts but the mainstream media in this country is wholly corrupt they're involved in this campaign not only against Russia but also against the social media Giants I mean this is a farce these MPs went all the way to Washington - question do they not understand how the internet works they could have got them on a Skype call and questioned them it's farcical and it's a waste of my taxpayers money and it's a very very annoying it's a joke how can you explain that the head of the investigation Damion Collins is now pressing tech giants to carry out further research I can't explain it it's ridiculous as you said in your piece just a moment ago only 49 that counts less than 900 or 600 retweets this is not even a story it's not even a one line story and it's about the time people started telling the truth this narrative that Russia is somehow the enemy is so outmoded so outdated and people I speak to within my podcasts and my emails and on Twitter itself they know this is a joke but somehow the mainstream media play along and I think it's interesting that Damien says that his instinct is there's a lot more what if his instinct is that good could he tell me the numbers for this week's national lottery because I'd like to put some money on it's a joke it's a farce and I can only apologize to the Russian people this nonsense has got to stop nobody interfere blue breaks it breaks it was the Democratic votes of the people of our great country they wanted out and the establishment and their friends in politics and their friends in the mainstream media just don't like the results they can't understand it and so it was got to be a fiddle it's got to be Russian influence it's nonsense what's also interesting is how Mr Collins gets so angry at you when the tech giant's that show no proof of Russia interference as the head of the investigation shouldn't he be a bit more impartial on the matter yes he should but I've been up before these committees myself they act in an almost kangaroo called fashion firing questions at you and hardly waiting to listen to the answers he yes he should be he should be trying to get to the truth and it would appear at the moment mother I'm the biggest fan by the way of Twitter or Facebook and the people who run them but it would appear at the moment that there is no real evidence of Russian meddling in brexit so why shouldn't mr. Collins just accept that and move on why is he had to go to Washington this outlets across party seems to me like a fantastic jolly that they've all been on and I think now he needs to drop this and also do you know what I don't think the British public care they know why people voted for brexit they know it was nothing to do with Donald Trump or Russian influence let's just get over it and accept democracy radio host on gorn's thank you for your time
