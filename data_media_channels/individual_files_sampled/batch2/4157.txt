today Donald Trump's long threaten tariffs against China went into effect Washington imposed tariffs on 34 billion dollars worth of imported Chinese goods invasion quickly retaliated with thirty four billion dollars in tariffs on imported US goods like soybeans pork seafood cars and whiskey China's commerce ministry accused the Trump administration of igniting the biggest trade war in economic history in response to what he has said our years of unfair trade policies the president had already imposed tariffs on imports from Europe Canada and Mexico which responded in kind as well as Japan and he's threatening an additional five hundred billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports fallout from this growing trade war is expected to hit Trump's base the hardest retaliatory tariffs target products that are mostly produced in the states that voted for Donald Trump joining me now to explain it all is one of the all-time veterans of the world the financial journalism CNBC contributor Ron and sana Ron are we in a trade war and how big is it we are in a trade war it is not yet the biggest in history this is not the trade war to end all trade Wars yet Steve in fact you'd have to go back to the 1930s to see that where we had intense protectionism the so called smoot-hawley Tariff that were passed then that deepened the Great Depression and led to competitive currency devaluations what they called beggar-thy-neighbor policies that really made things much worse we're at the beginning of a trade war if the president were to impose that 500 billion dollars worth of tariffs on Chinese goods that's everything that China sends us that would be the trade war to end all trade wars that would really rattle the not only world markets but the economy because that was my other question looking at the stock market today it seemed like I think it went up at end of the day right so Wall Street not yet responding like this is a panic situation well certain that panic and Wall Street's been goin sideways since January really since we topped out we haven't made a new all-time high in the Dow or the SP for quite some time the Nasdaq being strong in technology has been doing well and the Russell 2000 a small cap average that is focused on domestic companies that would not be affected by trade wars has gone to a succession of new highs so we see the market differentiating industrial stocks have taken a hit so in a certain sense parts of the market are reflecting this merging trade war but the overall market hasn't really collapsed it has in China however Chinese stocks are down about 23% from their most recent high is there anything to the theory Trump talks about being the negotiator about leverage about the idea of you start to go down this road you rattle China and then they get nervous and then you're able to have some leverage to recenter the relationship somehow well there may be except that China likes to play a long game when they're thinking about China 2025 or China 2050 we're thinking about USA tomorrow and so to the extent that you have a leader there who is leader for life and you have a president who's a temporary occupant of the White House there are different strategies at work here now the Chinese could take the hit for a longer period of time potentially in the United States if they choose to do so right now their economy is faltering a bit so they may get hit a little bit harder but also getting hit are US companies that export that re-import parts from other places that they manufacture in China then bring things home that are now being hit with tariffs there are companies in the United States that are feeling the effect of higher prices higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs so everybody has something to lose tarek trade wars are not win-win they're not even zero-sum games they're lose-lose generally speaking well so that the next step when you say it would elevate it to a situation on par with something we saw back back in the 30s in terms of the scale of it is there a sense when the administration would make that decision if it makes that decision no I don't think yet I mean it's moving reasonably quickly as it is I mean the Commerce Department determined that the u.s. was harmed economically to the tune of about 50 billion dollars its imposed 34 billion dollars worth of tariffs on Chinese goods when you start going above that level of economic harm then you have to wonder how China will retaliate how hard they'll go will they drive down the value of the currency their own currency which would make their exports cheaper and offset the impact of the tariffs they've already now reduced tariffs on goods that are being imported from places like Vietnam and other Asian nations they've stopped buying US soybeans so this could escalate very quickly it could get out of control and if that were to happen you could see a global recession because outside of the United States Europe is weakening economically China Japan's kind of moribund and so it could get nasty quickly the markets are focused more on short-term realities the economy here is good profits look decent in the second quarter we'll start hearing about those next week but in the longer run when you look out if this thing were to spin out of control it would be a serious serious problem for the global and the domestic economies you mentioned this smoot-hawley Tariff Act going way back but more is there an example of a modern president who's done something on a smaller scale yeah sure Ronald Reagan did this with the Japanese if you recall 1986 or so we were losing manufacturing jobs to Japan and there was great consternation in Washington at one point a group of congressmen smashed a Toshiba television set on the steps of the Capitol and so we had some arguments with both Japan and Germany during that period but they were ultimately amicably amicably resolved and resulted in a strengthening of organizations like the World Trade Organization whereas the Trump administration wants to break away from those multilateral agreements that govern international trade if that also were to happen if NAFTA were to break down we were to pull out of the WTO as the president may have suggested at one point along the way at least according to some reports then again you'd see a fraying of the global trading system and that could lead to a weakening of the global economy hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date
