THIS AS CORDUROY ATTACKS HIS 0

8
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:26,024
OPPONENT'S FOX NEWS APPEARANCES

9
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:27,859
MPLE HE KNOWS THE GAME HE'S

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:28,193
PLAYING.

11
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:29,928
HE'S BROUGHT ON SO THEY CAN SAY

12
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:32,097
HE'S FAIR AND BALANCED.

13
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,198
HE'S THEIR HOUSE POODLE.

14
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:35,267
HE PLAYED THE GAME, TOOK THEIR

15
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:36,034
MONEY, MADE HIS CHOICES.

16
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:39,604
>> HERE TO REACT, 2008

17
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,373
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL

18
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:44,609
CANDIDATE DENNIS CUE

19
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:44,643
CANDIDATE DENNIS KUE

20
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:45,043
CANDIDATE DENNIS KUCINICH.

21
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:46,845
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE THIS

22
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:47,279
MORNING.

23
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,081
YOUR REACTION TO THE ATTACK AD

24
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,850
THAT YOU ARE FOX NEWS' HOUSE

25
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,184
POODLE.

26
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:58,023
>> LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY THAT

27
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,892
MR. CORDRAY WAS THE WATCHDOG AT

28
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:03,695
THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BOARD

29
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:05,230
BUT THE CATCH DOG WALKED AWAY

30
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:11,636
FROM HIS POST AND COST MILLIONS

31
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,104
DOLLARS.

32
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:15,073
I THINK IF HE'S GOING TO STAY

33
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:20,846
MAKING CANINE COMPARISONS, WE

34
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:22,080
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,949
WHEN HE LEFT HIS POST, HE TURNED

36
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:26,017
THE KEYS OF THE FINANCE

37
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:27,185
PROTECTION BUREAU OVER TO THE

38
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:28,086
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

39
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:29,621
SO YOU KNOW, I THINK HE HAS SOME

40
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:30,555
ACCOUNTING TO DO ON THAT.

41
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:31,957
>> ALL RIGHT.

42
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:35,227
SO RICHARD CORDRAY BACKED BY

43
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:36,395
ELIZABETH WARREN.

44
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:37,729
THE PRIMARY IS THIS COMING

45
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,165
TUESDAY, A STATE THAT PEOPLE ARE

46
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:40,966
WATCHING CLOSELY.

47
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,101
THE PRESIDENT THERE YESTERDAY

48
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:44,669
TOUTING TAX REFORM.

49
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,271
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF WHERE THE

50
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:47,439
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS IN THE STATE

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,206
OF OHIO.

52
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:52,444
YOU LOOK AT CORDRAY CLEARLY WITH

53
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:53,678
LIBERAL POLICIES

54
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,180
POLICY

55
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,213
POOLICY

56
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:55,247

57
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:55,280

58
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,914

HAPPEN ON TUESDAY?

63
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,684
>> ELIZABETH WARREN IS OPPOSED

64
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,686
TO ASSAULT WEAPONS IN HER STATE

65
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:02,687
OF MASSACHUSETTS BUT APPARENTLY

66
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:05,157
IS FOR THEM IN THE STATE OF OHIO

67
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:07,559
BECAUSE MR. CORDRAY IS FULL ON

68
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,527
WITH THE NRA ON THAT.

69
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:11,129
IT'S A CONTRADICTION THERE.

70
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,731
BUT AS FAR AS THE OTHER ISSUES,

71
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:15,500
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

72
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,335
GIVE THE PEOPLE A REAL CHOICE,

73
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:19,304
WHETHER IT'S UNEMPLOYMENT OR

74
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:21,440
FULL EMPLOYMENT ECONOMY OR

75
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,743
RISING STUDENT DEBT OR FREE

76
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:28,447
COLLEGE, FOR-PROFIT HEALTH CARE,

77
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,583
NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH CARE.

78
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,385
ASSAULT WEAPONS OR A BAN ON

79
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,219
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

80
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,388
I'M TRYING TO HELP THE

81
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:37,122
DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEFINE ITSELF

82
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,891
SO IT CAN WIN IN NOVEMBER.

83
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,660
IF NOT, IT'S GOING TO BE THE

84
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,627
SAME OLD SAME OLD.

85
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:44,362
WE HAVE TO OFFER THE AMERICANS A

86
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:44,763
REAL CHOICE.

87
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,531
>> THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER

88
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:49,100
WARNING THAT THE BLUE WAVE HAS

89
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,734
STALLED.

90
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,037
HE SAYS DEMOCRATIC MOMENTUM HAS

91
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:54,139
STALLED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

92
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,843
DEMOCRATS HAVE APPEARED LESS

93
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,578
FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES THAT

94
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:01,379
ENGAGE THE PRESIDENT TRUMP

95
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,115
VOTER, AT THE SAME TIME, WHITE

96
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:07,219
WORKING CLASS MEN COULD POINT TO

97
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,454
A CONSERVATIVE POLICY

98
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:09,855
ACHIEVEMENT.

99
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:12,424
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT

100
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,626
STATEMENT COMING FROM A

101
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:15,260
DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER BEING

102
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,062
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS

103
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,663
LOOZEING THEIR MOMENTUM.

104
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:24,236
THEY'RE NO FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES

105
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,804
THAT AMERICANS ARE FOCUSED

106
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:26,104
ABOUT.

107
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:28,006
>> IT'S NOT JUST WHITE FOLK THAT

108
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:28,640
ARE CONCERNED.

109
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,342
WE HAVE TO TURN OUT WORKING

110
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:31,476
PEOPLE, WHATEVER THEIR COLOR AND

111
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:34,646
TO RESPOND TO THEIR PRACTICAL

112
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:36,615
ASPIRATIONS FOR GOOD PAYING

113
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,650
JOBS, FOR NOT JUST BETTER WAGES

114
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,318
BUT FOR BENEFITS.

115
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,889
YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

116
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,324
LOST TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE YEARS

117
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:48,326
AGO WHEN IT WENT WITH THESE

118
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:51,263
TRADE DEALS THAT TOOK JOBS OUT

119
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:53,298
OF OUR COUNTRY, WHEN THEY

120
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,166
CONTINUED TO FUND THE WARS, WHEN

121
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,502
THEY BAILED OUT THE BANKS ON

122
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:58,003
WALL STREET.

123
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,571
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THE REAL

124
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:00,572
DEMOCRATS TO SHOW UP.

125
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:02,107
AND I'M A REAL DEMOCRAT.

126
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:03,675
THE DEMOCRATIC ACCOMPLISHMENT

127
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:06,044
WANTS TO WIN CONTROL FOR

128
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:07,345
THEMSELVES, NOT FOR THE PEOPLE.

129
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:09,247
AND BOTH PARTY ESTABLISHMENTS

130
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:10,615
ARE LOCKED INTO YESTERDAY.

131
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,484
SO YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT

132
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:15,620
THERE'S ANOTHER SHAKEUP COMING

133
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,889
IN 2018 IN BOTH PARTY

134
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:18,656
ESTABLISHMENTS BETTER WATCH OUT.

135
00:04:18,656 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE WILL SEE.
