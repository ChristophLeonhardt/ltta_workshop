FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:08,245
ANGLE.

4
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:09,714
AS WE APPROACH ELECTION DAY,

5
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:11,048
HERE IS ONE THING THAT HAS

6
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:14,652
BECOME PATENTLY OBVIOUS.

7
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:15,619
DEMOCRATS ARE UNINTERESTED IN

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,855
THE THINGS AMERICANS CARE ABOUT

9
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:18,155
MOST.

10
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:20,191
THEIR PROSPERITY AND THEIR

11
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,392
SAFETY.

12
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,394
INSTEAD OF POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS,

13
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:25,529
DEMOCRATS POISON AMERICAN

14
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,298

15
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:27,466
ATOMIZATION

16
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:30,534
DEMONIZATION.

17
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:33,070
IN THE KAVANAUGH SAGA, WE SAW

18
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,374
THEY ARE MASTERS OF PRODUCING

19
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,241
CHOREOGRAPHED OUTRAGE.

20
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,309
AFTER THAT BACKFIRED, DEMOCRATS

21
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,478
STARTED TO PANIC.

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,212
ALTHOUGH STILL FAVORED TO TAKE

23
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:42,113
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTED, THINGS

24
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:45,850
BEGAN TO SHIFT SOMEWHAT AFTER

25
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,084

26
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:50,020
STORIES SUDDENLY BEGAN TO POP UP

27
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,590
THAT PELOSI, SCHUMER, AND

28
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,792
COMPANY, WOULD CONCERN THAT

29
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:55,292
LATINO VOTERS WERE

30
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:56,527
INSUFFICIENTLY ENTHUSIASTIC IN

31
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,562
THE MIDTERM.

32
00:00:58,563 --> 00:00:59,363
WHICH COULD DOOM DEMOCRATS

33
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:02,433
CHANCES TO TAKE THE HOUSE.

34
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:04,168
THEN, LIKE MAGIC, A FEW DAYS

35
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:05,669
LATER A STORY APPEARED OUT OF

36
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,175
NOWHERE ABOUT ANOTHER CARAVAN OF

37
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:16,347

THE CARAVAN FOR A TIME BEFORE HE

43
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:37,067
WAS ARRESTED.

44
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:38,869
WHAT STARTED AS A GROUP OF 1600

00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,238
SOON BECAME 2,000.

46
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:41,739
AND THEN 4,000.

47
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,808
APPARENTLY GROWING.

48
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:46,844
MEANWHILE, CRUSADING REPORTERS

49
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,612

55
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,724
WE SEE IT AT THIS POINT IS TO

IMMIGRATION.

79
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,397
ONE OF THE WORST THINGS TO

80
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:43,534

00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:03,521

TACKLE THIS PROBLEM.

183

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,780
AMONG THE LATINO PLURALISTS TO

190
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:19,850
TRY TO FILL CONGRESS.

191
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,784
AGAIN, NO IDEAS, JUST MORE

192
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:24,621
EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION.

193
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:26,824
WE WELCOME AND WE TREASURE THE

194
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:27,958
HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS OF THIS

195
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,226
COUNTRY WHO CAME HERE THE LEGAL

196
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:32,863
WAY, LIKE TIA FROM VENEZUELA WHO

197
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:34,798
CALLED IN TO MY RADIO SHOW

198
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,766
TODAY.

199
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,401
>> I WAS BORN IN VENEZUELA.

200
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:39,236
I AM A PROUD AMERICAN CITIZEN

201
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:40,037
NOW.

202
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:41,939
BUT I AM TERRIFIED OF WHAT IS

203
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,306
HAPPENING.

204
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,208
MY MOTHER WOULD'VE NEVER THOUGHT

205
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,810
IN VENEZUELA 30 YEARS LATER WAS

206
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:49,213
GOING TO BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY.

207
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:51,482
AND 5-8 YEARS AFTER THAT WAS

208
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,650
GOING TO DESCEND INTO A

209
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,018
DICTATORSHIP.

210
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,253
ONCE THEY GET IN, THEY CHANGE

211
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:57,020
THE CONSTITUTION, THEY AREN'T

212
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,156
EVEN WAITING.

213
00:06:59,157 --> 00:06:59,757
THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE

214
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:04,061
CONSTITUTION AND THERE GOES OUR

215
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:04,428
COUNTRY.

216
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:05,262
>> Laura: THERE GOES OUR

217
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:05,796
COUNTRY.

218
00:07:05,797 --> 00:07:08,432
I GET A LOT OF CALLS IN THE

219
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,266
RADIO, LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND

220
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:09,566
RANGE.

221
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,572
WE ALL KNOW THE NEGATIVE -- LOOK

222
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:18,542
NO FURTHER THAN CALIFORNIA'S

223
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:23,046
RAMPANT HOMELESSNESS, FILTHY

224
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:26,784
STREETS, POLLUTING WELFARE

225
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,719
PROGRAMS FOR THAT'S WHAT THE

226
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,621
DEMOCRATIC

227
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:32,222
DEMOCRAT SUPER MAJORITY AS OF

228
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:33,023
LOOKING LIKE.

229
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:34,424
THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING UP FOR

230
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:34,825
YOU.

231
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:37,461
HE WANTS THIS TO STOP.

232
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:40,030
THIS MORNING, HE TWEETED, "WE

233
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,431
SPEND BILLIONS ENFORCING OTHER

234
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:42,432
COUNTRIES' BORDERS AS OUR OWN

235
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,035
HAS BECOME A JOKE.

236
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:46,270
OUR LAWS IGNORED AND OUR

237
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:52,409
GENERATION AND COMPASSION

238
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,211
EXPLOITED" HERE WE HAVE ALMOST

239
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,447
NO CONTROL OF THEIR POPULATIONS,

240
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:58,582
I ASKED MEXICO THE STOP IS ON

241
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,417
AND IF ARE THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO

242
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:02,586
SO, I WILL CALL UP THE U.S.

243
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:03,654
MILITARY AND CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN

244
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:03,987
BORDER.

245
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:05,756
THAT'S WHAT HIS TWEETS SAID.

246
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:09,993
THE DEMOCRATS TALK TAKING THE

247
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:12,196
HOUSE WILL ENSURE THAT THIS

248
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:13,463
CARAVAN OF 4,000 EVENTUALLY

249
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:18,702
BECOMES A SLOW 4 MILLION PLUS

250
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:19,403
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

251
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:21,805
THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.

252
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:23,674
BUT AS WE TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT,

253
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,342
IF YOU ARE STILL ON THE FENCE

254
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,010
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IN

255
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,612
THE MIDTERM ELECTION, JUST THINK

256
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,080
FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHO IS IN

257
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,415
LINE TO CHAIR THE IMPORTANT

258
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,417
COMMITTEES WHEN IT COMES TO

259
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,052
THESE ISSUES, LIKE HOMELAND

260
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:35,752
SECURITY AND THE JUDICIARY

261
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:36,520
COMMITTEE IF THE DEMOCRATS TAKE

262
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,989
THE HOUSE.

263
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:40,757
BENNIE THOMPSON FROM MISSISSIPPI

264
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:43,794
WOULD TAKE HOMELAND SECURITY.

265
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:46,163
>> YOU WOULD THINK THE MOST

266
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:46,830
IMPORTANT HOMELAND SECURITY

267
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:49,366
PROBLEM FACING THE NATION IS A

268
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,034
HANDFUL OF CENTRAL AMERICANS

269
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:53,437
MOVING THROUGH MEXICO.

270
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:55,205
THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT SO.

271
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,141
BETTER TO DISTRACT THE AMERICAN

272
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:02,412
PEOPLE FROM THE REAL ISSUES

273
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:05,215
FACING -- PERHAPS FROM THE

274
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,283
PRESIDENT'S OWN PROBLEMS TOO.

275
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:08,285
>> Laura: JERRY METTLER WITH

276
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:08,886
OVER TWO JUDICIARY WHICH

277
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:12,222
INCLUDES IMMIGRATION AND BORDER

278
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:12,589
SECURITY.

279
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,291
HE'S FAR MORE INTERESTED IN

280
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,192
INVESTIGATING JUST A KAVANAUGH

281
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:16,493
THEN SOLVING OUR BORDER PROBLEM.

282
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:21,632
COME ON.

283
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:22,833
HISPANIC AMERICANS ARE SMART

284
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,401
ENOUGH TO SPOT A CON WHEN THEY

285
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:24,835
SEE ONE.

286
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,703
I SAY IT'S TIME TO WALK AWAY

287
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:28,939
FROM THE DEMOCRATS' CYNICAL GAME

288
00:09:28,940 --> 00:00:00,000
OF IDENTITY POLITICS AND
