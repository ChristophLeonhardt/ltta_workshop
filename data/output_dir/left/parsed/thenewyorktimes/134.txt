I believe that travel
is good for the world.
I believe that people
should travel more.
And I believe if people
did travel more the world
would be a better place.
It’s been hitting
me more and more
that this is an opportunity.
I’m never going to
have again, that I
have to take it just with
as much gusto as I can.
So I can’t believe
that I’m in Iceland
and this is part of my job.
And I felt really grateful
for this being something
that I get to do in my life.
