now to our special interview and a new focus tonight on a group that is so central to everything under investigation in 2016 WikiLeaks their founder today Julian Assange says he's been called for an interview with Congress and he released a letter from the Senate Intelligence Committee that asked for an interview for the Russia probe please make yourself available top senators are not commenting Asajj says he is considering doing the interview so now we are going to turn in a moment to one of the few Americans who's ever sat and interviewed Assange radio host an activist Randi credit go Roger stone has called credit Co his back channel to WikiLeaks something we've reported on on this show now the last time I spoke to Randy credit Co he told me guess what what's happening now he said it Sarge was open to speaking to congressional investigators I had gone there with a mandate from Assange for mr. Schiff to go over there and interview him from Assange what you have Julian Assange willing to speak to Adam Schiff yes yes and why does this are in your view want to speak to us he can clear it all up he's ready to talk to Adam Schiff if he wants to go over there he's waiting for him that news broke right here on MSNBC there was pushback from the hill but now we're seeing this new heat on WikiLeaks including from something that we all learn about often after the fact Bob Muller has been referencing the organization in his questioning and his work and his new indictments of Russian hackers now it doesn't call out WikiLeaks by name it refers to it as organization one but you see there over and over and over Muller saying organization one WikiLeaks is key to what the Russians did there were other connections as well the Trump campaign had of course Donald Trump jr. busted for DMing with the group Roger stone also exchanging messages and claiming that he had additional communication with them I actually have communicated with the son I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there's no telling what the October Surprise may be stone has since walked some of that back and then there is the candidate himself willing to take their help it's been amazing what's coming out on Wikileaks this WikiLeaks is unbelievable WikiLeaks I love WikiLeaks I am joined now by Randy credit oh you are I will note somewhat controversial figure but what you said on this news program appears to have been borne out in public now why is Julian Assange saying he's willing to talk and do you think he really would talk to investigators well I think that he would provided that the parameters are set in a way that's not unfavorable to him and it can't be a trap they have to treat him respectfully and they have to do it with a lot of professionalism not just go in there and do some kind of surprise attack do you believe it's someone who's interacted with him and you have been favorable to him yes that he will be accurate to the u.s. committees about a matter that he has appeared to prejudge and been defensive about saying this is all garbage well I think he listened you have to sit down with the person who's a very honest individual a very forthright a man of great integrity I think that if if they work it out it would be a real boon for this invest I think that you'll find out that there really isn't that much to it at least that's what I feel that much to the idea that this was an espionage operation rather than as WikiLeaks as it has claimed that however many governments are mad at it they often upset governments by publishing material that they say is accurate right but here he was talking to you and we talked to you because you talked to him Randy right guy last time by the way was right after I did your show for the very first time that was the last time we had a communication he said by the way he can't watch a show right now he is totally gagged he has no contact you are a very smart guy and he says do your show he enjoys your show but he can't watch it now he encouraged you to speak up on the show which which is interesting now here he is talking to you undermining basically the idea that there is something to the Russia probe take a look this whole thing about Russia and trying to vilify you as some agent of the Russians it's complete garbage what is a response to that why did complete garbage it's a complete nonsense so here he was in April saying that and earlier when he did speak to Fox News he also basically denied what has been borne out what Muller is charging hasn't been proven in court yet what the intelligence agencies have asserted that the Russians were behind a lot of this take a look at his denials to Fox News can you say to the American people unequivocally that you did not get this information about the DNC John Podesta Gmail's can you tell the American people a thousand percent you did not get it from Russia or everybody associated with Russia our source is not the Russian government is their value and him saying that to the intelligence committees when you must admit the evidence goes the other way I don't think the evidence Duskull though I don't think he got got it from the Russians I really don't now time like Vince that what's ours right the Payton do you accept do you accept that the Russians did hack I'm not for sure I'm not ruling it out that the Russians did but I always have thought that it was a leak I'm not for sure no one knows for sure what it really is let's say the intelligence agencies have concluded this Donald Trump's aides have cleaned up his denials to reassert that it happened that way and molars charged it with a lot of detail again I have to be clear as I do with all cases it hasn't proven in court but if your position and Asajj was his position is that the original hack wasn't even the Russians he might very well end up murdering himself before the committee I don't think so I think it's a very smart man he's a very honest person I think he has a lot to say if they treat this if they're looking to get to the bottom of this he will be totally vindicated how's the eye opinion no sighs I know I've been in that embassy three or four by the way the embassy is a very small embassy it's very hot inside he is under a lot of pressure has been there now without any communication for five months a hundred degrees no air conditioning I think that he will be vindicated and what's the charge anyway he didn't do anything he's not the guy that like grabbed the stuff out of the the DNC file he just put it out there what did he do that the New York Times didn't do or the Washington Post didn't do I want to be you're raising a valid legal defense which is that the platform upon which the stolen material is released is not criminally culpable inside the United States sure but I want to be precise what Julian Assange is saying in public is not that not hey we're just a platform he's saying we didn't get it from the Russians which itself if he says that is you know under US law to these committees and that's not true that's a new problem so how can they help us go in South can they don't let's go inside Julian Assange is mine is he trolling everyone or does he want to come and say what he said to Fox in a legal proceeding because he's got his own legal problems already well I don't know what the legal problems are because everything seems to be secret clandestine charges against Julian Assange we don't even know if they exists and what we don't know how simply be you don't know what the legal problems are you don't know why he's in in protected status and I know why he I know why because he skipped bail there he skipped bail and that's the reason why they're keeping them in there until he comes out and they'll know arrest them for bail skipping they don't have charges that have been made public and a lot of people don't think there are charges now remember this is not the Roman Empire when the Roman Empire in Rome you had laws for Roman citizens and different laws of Macedonia in Egypt everybody is subjected to the same laws the First Amendment whether it be someone from the BBC or someone from the London Times there they get the benefit of the First Amendment so does he let me read to you from the indictment just to make sure we're clear on this organization one this is the molar indictment organization one releases 20,000 emails it says stolen from the DNC network WikiLeaks released 20,000 emails as is well known July 22nd from the DNC right do you have any reason other than your affinity for Assange to doubt this material I believe that that stuff was released where it came from I have no idea I certainly know he did not get it from the Russians and I can prove me wrong can you prove me wrong well I'm showing you the evidence right that's that's not the evidence that's something that Muller put out there in his investigators we don't know for sure where it really came from you can say 17 is not 17 intelligence community organizations that have died off on this that's not true there's three or four that's all but they really for the number you're talking about does the director there's all these other okay you're on oath in Reid if we have they ever give in Reid if your problem is right how they think about the Iraqi war that there was weapons of mass destruction number ten or twelve different organizations same thing about the gulf of tonkin so there's reasons to doubt intelligence community look I think for viewers who are watching you and to and assessing you it is true that you are someone who over the course of your entire career has been dubious and skeptical of government assertions and sure I think the Iraq war is a is one that comes up a lot on the left and the right Donald Trump sites and I think we all know the differences and we're not going to reopen all that right now you have to work on this not black war and I know you were probably public evidence has Bob Miller called you in to testify they did they actually didn't call me in they actually showed up and they asked me to come in and do a personal voluntary interview which they who is they that shows somebody from his is investigation where did they find you I don't want to say where but they found me but they came to you in person it came to me in personnel or some kind of a loose of these days you know there are people out there saying bad things about me well you you're making news as you often do yours you're confirming that that federal agents working for Bob Muller came to you and yes yes and what did they ask you they asked me if I would like to do a vote well we set up a conversation with somebody from the Muller team and they asked my lawyer if I would like to go down and do a voluntary interview and he said no you know I didn't get a subpoena they asked me for a voluntary interview let's make sure we understand I don't believe you said this on air before probably not okay so let's make sure we understand it because the probe is of great interest and you're in there as an associate and I'm not I'm not implying anything negative about you but as a known associate of Roger stone and Julian associate of stone I know stone which I don't know your Miller is an associate you're here you're here to give your side of this right what word would you use I would say someone that has worked with stone before but not an associate of former colleague no I've worked on a campaign or two with Roger stone and the former camp no 16 years I've known me okay I mean it sounds like you're going up from associate not down when you say you're a scholar we're looking at an LLC together you know I don't know I've known him we've gone years without talking to each other and then he'll bring me in he did my radio show so a whole the whole year 2016 every month I had him on because he is great did have more on television Andy your radio show punches way above its weight and political activist for a long time I just want to be clear what we're learning from you and folks can make up their own mind about it but we're telling us tonight on your assertion is federal agents came to you in New York and asked you for a voluntary interview from the Moller probe presumably about stone and WikiLeaks well present I here here's yes I'm not going to taste specifically what they asked me and I kept this under my hat for at least six weeks I didn't want to talk about it cuz I don't want to instigate the special prosecutor I understand that and we're just trying to learn facts here but they came to you they work for volunteering and yes you're know they set up a conversation with my lawyer for the following Monday and your lawyer declined to client you available for a volunteer yes and how long ago was that I don't know five or six weeks ago and you have not heard from them said no you think I'm clear do I think you're clear rappers say Giuliani say you'd say five or six is whatever this has been one good thing about this I do a great Rudy Giuliani we're not doing impressions well you know so mad at me I gotta tell you your followers get so mad at me when I do impressions like I was always waiting to do my Reagan impression we're not doing them probably no you're not I'm doing a September 16th I'm doing a show at the Commons and Brooklyn I'm back into doing stand-up comedy you said before I before we go and in
