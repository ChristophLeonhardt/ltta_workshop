last thing before we go tonight is to take you to a place where any tension between Russians and Americans takes a backseat mostly because what's going on in the front seat is so harrowing today a Soyuz rocket carried two Americans and a Russian into orbit where tonight they're getting settled onboard the International Space Station let's leave aside for one moment that no one involved in the space race back in the day at NASA started by Kennedy continued under Johnson no one would ever believe our astronauts are flying on Russian hardware because we have no other way of getting them up there right now so setting that aside they've now joined a crew of an American a Russian and a Japanese astronaut who were already up there while there's no effort to create a single culture in space and for example there's American food on board there's Russian food there's Japanese food astronauts sign up for close quarters and long trips away from home that's kind of the job they are good at it and they tend to get along and work hard side by side and a reminder go to the NASA website look for the section called spot the station punch in your zip code where you live and you'll then get a text when the space station flies over where you live and on a cloudless night watching that thing fly over 200 miles up and at 17,000 miles an hour across the night sky is a spectacular sight especially when you consider that the crew of six represents the only people on the planet who aren't living here currently hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
