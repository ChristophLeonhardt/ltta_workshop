FRIENDS, THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE 
THAT HAVE BEEN FROM PEOPLE IN 
THIS TOWN, IN THIS COUNTY, IN 
THIS STATE, IN THIS COUNTRY AND 
ACROSS THE WORLD. 
WE APPRECIATE EVERY ACT THAT 
HAS BEEN BE KNOWED UPON US. 
THIRDLY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK 
STEVE RODES OF JACEE PARE 
CONSTRUCTION WHO SHOWED UP ON 
MY DOOR STEP WITH VOICE 
CRACKING SAYING WE HAVE TO DO 
SOMETHING NOW AND STEVE KNOWS 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN NOW. 
THERE WERE A LOT OF WORDS AND 
SWEAR WORDS ESPECIALLY ON MY 
PART BUT AS OF 9:00 YESTERDAY 
MORNING THE REWARD FUND THAT 
BRINGS MOLLIETIVE EATS SAFE 
REWARD FUND WAS ESTABLISHED AND 
BEING FUNDED SO WITH THAT BEING 
SAID THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF 
OUR DAUGHTER AND OUR SISTER 
MOLLIETIVE EATS WOULD LIKE TO 
ANNOUNCE THAT WE HAVE SET-UP A 
BRING MOLLIE TIBBETTS HOME SAFE 
REWARD FUND HERE IN IOWA. 
WE BELIEVE THAT MOLLIE IS STILL 
ALIVE AND IF SOMEONE HAS 
ABDUCTED HER WE ARE PLEADING 
WITH YOU TO PLEASE RELEASE HER. 
WE ARE PARTNERING WITH 
CRIMESTOPPERS OF CENTRAL IOWA 
TO HELP FACILITATE THE PROCESS 
OF RECEIVING INFORMATION 
ANONYMOUSLY. 
THAT WE CAN USE TO PAY FOR HER 
RELEASE OR INFORMATION THAT 
WOULD LEAD TO HER LOCATION. 
AND WE HAVE RAISED $172,000 
THAT WOULD BE PAID TO YOU AS 
SOON AS MOLLIE IS SAFELY HOME. 
YOU CAN CONTACT CRIMESTOPPERS 
OF CENTRAL IOWA AT 1(800)452-
1111. 
OR E-MAIL YOUR TIP ONLINE AT 
WWW.CRIMESTOPPERS OF CENTRAL 
IOWA.COM. 
ONCE AGAIN THAT IS ANONYMOUS. 
IF ANYBODY HAS SEEN ANYTHING 
THAT YOU FEEL IS RELATED TO 
MOLLIE'S DISAPPEARANCE, PLEASE 
ALSO CONTACT CRIMESTOPPERS AND 
THAT INFORMATION WILL BE 
FORWARDED TO WITH YOUR IDENTITY 
BEING PROTECTED. 
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ALSO 
DONATE TO THE BRING MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS HOME SAFE REWARD FUND 
YOU CAN GO TO CRIMESTOPPERS OF 
CENTRAL IOWA WEBSITE FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION TO MAKE 
THAT DONATION. 
WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR ALL OF 
THE EFFORTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AND OUR FRIENDS AND SEARCHING 
FOR MOLLIE. 
IT IS OUR GREATEST HOPE THAT IF 
SOMEONE HAS HER THAT THEY WOULD 
JUST RELEASE HER AND CLAIM THAT 
MONEY THAT WE HAVE RAISED FOR 
HER FREEDOM. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING 
HERE AND I'M TURNING IT OVER TO 
GREG WILEY WITH CRIMESTOPPERS 
OF CENTRAL IOWA. 
GREG? 
>> THANKS. 
>> YUP. 
>> WHAT I WANTED TO KIND OF DO 
IN SUPPORT OF THE FAMILY UNTIL 
WE GET FURTHER INFORMATION 
ABOUT MOLLIE WE ARE EXPECTING 
HER TO BE ALIVE. 
THIS IS KIND OF THE UNIQUE 
THING WE'VE DONE WITH 
CRIMESTOPPERS, WE WANT THE 
INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY HAVE HER 
TO COME FORWARD AND THE BIGGEST 
THING I GUESS IS THAT THE 
REWARD FUND WILL CONTINUE TO 
GROW. 
WHAT WE DO AS CRIMESTOPPERS WE 
ARE BASICALLY A NON PROFIT 
501C3 ORGANIZATION. 
WE ARE RUN BY VOLUNTEERS HERE 
LOCALLY IN THE MORNING. 
ALL OF US HAVE REAL FULL TIME 
BUT WE LOVE DOING THIS BECAUSE 
IT HELPS THE COMMUNITY. 
ONE THING WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 
IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE 
TO GET HER BACK TO GET THIS 
THING BEYOND OUR COMMUNITIES IF 
SHE WAS ABDUCTED AND TAKEN 
SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY HAVE TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY CONTACT 
US WE CAN PROTECT OUR IDENTITY. 
IT'S ONE THING TO SAY, YOU KNOW 
WHAT, CALL US AND WE'LL PROTECT 
YOUR IDENTITY AND WON'T TELL 
ANYBODY. 
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO SAY WE 
DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE EVEN IF 
WE WANTED TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE. 
OUR SYSTEM IS SET-UP WE HAVE A 
SOFTWARE SYSTEM CALLED PEACH 
TREE SOFTWARE. 
IT IS PURCHASED THROUGH 
ANDERSON SOFTWARE COMPANY. 
BASICALLY WHEN ANY INFORMATION 
COMES IN IT'S INCRYPTED AND 
SCRUBBED AND SO THE ONLY THING 
THAT IS IDENTIFIED TO THAT 
INFORMATION IS AN ID NUMBER. 
THE TIP STARE THEN WILL HAVE TO 
PAY ATTENTION TO YOU GUYS AND 
CONTACT US BACK. 
WE HAVE NO WAY OF CONTACTING 
THEM BACK. 
IF WE DO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
HAVE AN INTERACTION WITH 
WHATEVER THE INDIVIDUAL IS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT GETS THIS 
INFORMATION PRETTY MUCH 
IMMEDIATELY. 
THE FACILITATOR OF IT THE 
SAFETY NET FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
GREAT PARTNERS MOST OF THE 
PUBLIC IS NOT AFRAID TO COME 
FORWARD AND SHARE INFORMATION. 
WE DO NOT EXIST FOR THOSE 
PEOPLE. 
WE EXIST FOR THE OTHER ONES WHO 
FOREVER REASON WOULD NOT COME 
AND COMMUNICATE ANY INFORMATION 
TO THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY ARE 
GUILTY OF SOMETHING THEMSELVES 
OR MAY BE INVOLVED IN A CRIME. 
SO THAT BEING SAID WE CAN TAKE 
A FEW QUESTIONS BUT THEY ARE 
GOING TO HAVE TO BE PRETTY MUCH 
TILTED TOWARDS THE REWARD FUND 
AND CRIMESTOPPERS. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE SHE'S 
ABDUCTED 
>> AT THIS TIME THAT'S ONE OF 
THE POSSIBILITIES. 
>> HOW CAN PEOPLE DONATE? 
I KNOW THERE'S A LINK ON THE 
CRIMESTOPPERS WEBSITE. 
HOW DOES THAT WORK? 
>> WHEN YOU GO TO CRIMESTOPPERS 
WE HAVE A TABITHA HAS MOLLIE'S 
NAME ON IT. 
YOU CLICK ON THAT AND YOU CAN 
WIRE THE MONEY AND A RECEIPT 
THAT YOU CAN FILL OUT AND MAIL 
ALSO THAT MONEY IN. 
WE ARE A NON501C3 SO TAX 
TAXDEDUCTIBLE. 
>> THIS IS YOUR DAUGHTER. 
HOW IS THE FAMILY HOLDING UP? 
>> THE FAMILY IS HOLDING UP 
JUST FINE. 
WE ARE SETTING OUR PERSONAL 
FEELINGS ASIDE. 
I WANT TO THANK THE MEDIA FOR 
COMING HERE AND HELPING US TO 
SHARE THIS STORY BECAUSE WE ARE 
TOLD VERY LITTLE BY THE 
AUTHORITIES FOR VERY GOOD 
REASON. 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PARTNERS. 
THEY'VE PUT TOGETHER AN 
INCREDIBLE INVESTIGATION. 
IT'S LARGE, IT'S SOPHISTICATED, 
IT'S AGGRESSIVE AND THEY HAVE 
BEEN NOTHING BUT SENSITIVE TO 
OUR FAMILY AND TO SUGGEST 
OTHERWISE IS WRONG. 
BUT THEY ARE NOT SHARING 
INFORMATION WITH US BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T NEED TO SHARE 
INFORMATION WITH SOMEONE WHO 
MIGHT BE I AM INDICATED IN 
THIS. 
THE OTHER PART IS YOU, THE 
MEDIA. 
YOU'VE BEEN WONDERFUL. 
YOU'VE TAKEN OUR STORY NATIONAL 
AND INTERNATIONAL AND TO KEEP 
THIS STORY AND THE PUBLIC 
CONSCIENCE IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE 
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOLVED BY 
SOMEONE COMING FORWARD WITH 
INFORMATION, EITHER INFORMATION 
THEY THINK IS TRIVIAL AND NOT 
WORTH SHARING OR INFORMATION 
THEY THINK IS GOING TO I AM 
INDICATE A LOVED ONE OR A 
FRIEND AND ARE AFRAID OF DOING 
THAT AND I'VE BEEN TELLING ALL 
OF YOU IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO 
HIDE YOU HAVE NOTHING FEAR SO 
COME FORWARD, SHARE THAT 
INFORMATION WITH THE 
AUTHORITIES AND LET'S BRING 
MOLLY HOME. 
AND THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR 
ARSENAL PROVIDING THIS FUND TO 
PROVIDE SOME FINANCIAL 
INCENTIVE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS 
OTHERWISE RELUCTANT TO COME 
FORWARD AND IF YOU CAN GET THIS 
STORY OUT, THEN MAYBE WE CAN 
BRING MOLLIE HOME AND WE'LL ALL 
HAVE A HAPPY ENDING TO THIS. 
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT 
THAT SHE WENT FROM $2,000 TO-- 
>> I THINK IT'S A TESTAMENT TO 
ALL OF THE MEDIA AND YOUR 
ABILITY TO GET THIS OUT. 
IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO PARTNER 
WITH THE MEDIA TO GET THIS 
STORY OUT AND HUMANIZE MOLLIE. 
SHE ISN'T ALL THAT MORE 
DIFFERENT THAN YOUR DAUGHTERS 
OR SISTERS OR GIRLFRIEND. 
SHE'S JUST A WONDERFUL NORMAL 
TERRIFIC PERSON AND WE ALL CAN 
IDENTIFY WITH THAT. 
SO LET'S BRING HER HOME. 
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO KEEP 
THIS STORY IN THE PUBLIC 
CONSCIENCE IS ESSENTIAL. 
>> IS THERE A WAY TO DETERMINE 
THE FURTHEST DONATION FROM OVER 
SEAS? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT 
IS ESSENTIAL. 
IT'S AS MUCH THE INCENTIVE IS 
ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE CAN USE 
ACROSS THE STREET FROM HERE THE 
COMMUNITY IS CREATING 
COLLATERAL T-SHIRTS, BUTTONS, 
PINS AND YARD SIGNS WITH THAT 
TIP NUMBER ON. 
AND SO WE CAN ONLY FIGHT THAT 
WAY. 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
AND LAURA PUT TOGETHER THIS 
FUND. 
WE'VE BEEN ON A SUPPORT TRACK 
TRYING TO WORK WITH YOU TO HELP 
YOU GET THIS STORY OUT. 
SO WE WAKE UP EVERY DAY AT 2 OR 
3 IN THE MORNING TO FIGHT AND 
LAURA IS FIGHTING THE BOYS ARE 
FIGHTING. 
DALTON IS FIGHTING. 
EVERYBODY IN THIS COMMUNITY IS 
FIGHTING TO GET HER BACK AND 
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY HELPFUL. 
>> THE NEW SIGHTING JUST 
ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY, WHAT DOES 
THAT GET YOU AS A LEAD? 
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
>> THERE WAS A SIGHTING 
 
THERE WAS A SIGHTING IN 
MISSOURI THAT THEY THOUGHT 
COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE THAT 
MATCHED THE DESCRIPTION BUT WE 
ARE LEARNING THAT IT'S NOT HER. 
>> I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD 
POINT. 
PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT BECAUSE 
THEY THINK IT'S IRRELEVANT OR 
TRIVIAL. 
NOTHING IS IRRELEVANT AND 
NOTHING IS TRIVIAL. 
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE TOLD US 
THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SORT 
OUT WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S 
WRONG SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
THAT'S EITHER TRIVIAL OR 
SOMETHING THAT EITHER COULD 
POTENTIALLY I AM APPLICABLE ATE 
SOMEONE YOU KNOW OR LOVE COME 
FORWARD WITH THE INFORMATION. 
AUTHORITIES CAN SORT THAT OUT 
AND DO IT QUICKLY. 
>> WELL THE LAST ONE THAT WE 
PARTICIPATED IN WAS ACTUALLY 
OAKLAND BACK IN 2051. 
FORTUNATELY WE DON'T GET THIS 
OPPORTUNITY AND ALL OF THIS 
THEY WERE SAYING THAT THE MONEY 
CAN BE AN INCENTIVE FOR 
SOMEBODY TO STEP UP. 
ESPECIALLY POSSIBLY DOING SOME 
OTHER THINGS MONTELL. 
BUT THE KEY PART IS WE CAN 
GUARANTY THEIR IDENTITY. 
WHAT I EXPLAINED BEFORE WE 
COULDN'T TELL YOU WHO THEY WERE 
EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO TELL WHO 
THEY WERE. 
THAT'S CRUCIAL FROM AS FAR AS 
THE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WHO 
DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED FEEL 
LIKE IF I SAY SOMETHING THEY 
ARE GOING TO TALK TO ME OR IN 
CASES IN THE PAST WHERE WE'VE 
HAD MOTHERS TURN IN SONS, 
FAMILY MEMBERS TURN IN OTHER 
FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
OUT OF CONTROL. 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 
UNLESS THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY 
SURE THAT THEIR IDENTITY WOULD 
BE PROTECTED AND THAT'S A 
CRUCIAL PART WHAT CRIME STOPPER 
DOES. 
WE ARE THE SAFETY NET. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES A GREAT 
JOB. 
MOST OF THE COMMUNITY, PUBLIC 
IS NOT AFRAID TO GET INVOLVED. 
WE EXIST FOR THAT SMALL 
MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC THAT 
WOULD NEVER PARTICIPATE UNLESS 
THEY WOULD GUARANTY THEIR 
IMMUNITY. 
>> HOW OFTEN ABOUT HAVE YOU 
SEEN THESE CASES TURN INTO A 
SUCCESS? 
>> WELL LOCALLY WE HAVEN'T HAD 
A LOT. 
I KNOW I SERVED ON THE BOARD 
NATIONALLY SEVERAL YEARS AGO 
AND THERE ARE STORIES ALL OVER 
THE PLACE WHERE THE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY DID GET SOMEBODY'S 
ATTENTION AND THEY DID COME 
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY WERE 
CONFIDENT THEY COULD COME 
FORWARD AND BE PROTECTED AND 
NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 
DYNAMICS WE ARE GOING TO SHAKE 
THE TREE. 
WE WANT SOMEBODY TO COME 
FORWARD EVEN IF IT'S NOT REAL 
AT LEAST TO START A 
CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY. 
SOMEBODY MIGHT KNOW THAT SHE'S 
BEING HELD BY SOMEBODY BUT 
WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING 
BECAUSE IF THEY SAID SOMETHING 
THEY MAY THINK THAT THEIR LIFE 
MIGHT BE IN DANGER. 
WE CAN GUARANTY THAT WHOEVER 
GIVES THIS INFORMATION UP THEIR 
IDENTITY WILL BE PROTECTED. 
>> HOW WOULD THEY GET THE 
MONEY? 
>> THEY'LL GET--WHEN THEY PUT 
IN THE TIP THEY GET A RANDOM 
NUMBER THAT MATCHES THAT TIP SO 
IF YOU ARE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 THEY'D 
HAVE TO CONTACT US BACK AND SAY 
HEY I SAW IN THE MEDIA--WELL IN 
THIS CASE IF THEY GOT THEM I 
WANT TO LET HER GO AND THAT 
NEGOTIATION WILL BE DONE WITH 
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A WHOLE 
NEW DYNAMIC WILL COME INTO PLAY 
AND WE HOPE THAT DYNAMIC COMES 
INTO PLAY. 
THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE 
ARE DOING. 
>> TALK TO US ABOUT THE 
PROCESS. 
>> I WASN'T--EXCUSE ME. 
I WASN'T THE MAIN--IT WAS A 
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN 
STEVE RHODES AND I. AND I HAD 
BEEN GETTING E-MAILS I BELIEVE 
THROUGH THE BANK THAT THERE WAS 
MONEY SITTING OUT THERE. 
ROB AND I--ROB STILL LIVES IN 
CALIFORNIA. 
ROB AND I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA. 
WE HAVE A TON OF FRIENDS THERE 
AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING ANGRY 
AS OF THREE DAYS AGO. 
STEVE AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING 
ON THIS ABOUT THREE DAYS AGO. 
WE HAVE MONEY, WE HAVE 
SUBSTANTIAL MONEY AND WE WANT 
TO HELP. 
SO THE REWARD FUND WAS EASY 
ENOUGH TO GET SET-UP BUT AS 
THROUGH ALL PROCESSES 
ESPECIALLY WHEN MONEY IS 
INVOLVED WE HAD TO WORK WITH 
LAWYERS AND JUST BE SURE 
EVERYTHING WAS WHERE IT SHOULD 
BE. 
BUT IT WAS JUST--IT WAS JUST 
FLYING BY THE SEAT OF YOUR 
PANTS BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SET-UP 
A REWARD FUND FOR MY DAUGHTER 
BEFORE AND IF IT WASN'T FOR 
STEVE, HE AND I WORKING 
TOGETHER, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE 
IT. 
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, 
THEY'LL TAKE YOUR NEXT 
QUESTION. 
>> TWO WEEKS ON JUST TELL US 
HOW WE ARE GETTING BY DAY-TO-
DAY AND WHAT YOU ARE DOING 
MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT JUST TO 
LOOK FOR HER AND GET THROUGH 
THIS EMOTION. 
>> EVERY DAY I FEEL MOLLY'S 
PRESENCE AND SOMETIMES I FEEL 
HER SITTING ON MY SHOULDER. 
AND MOLLIE WAS AN INCREDIBLY 
STRONG YOUNG WOMAN. 
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE 
THE STRENGTH IN ME BUT MOLLIE'S 
LENDING ME HER STRENGTH EVERY 
DAY EVERY NIGHT AND YES I HAVE 
MY MOMENTS OF COMPLETE 
MELTDOWNS. 
BUT IT IS THROUGH THIS STRENGTH 
THAT SOMEHOW AND I DON'T KNOW 
HOW BEING BEING BE KNOWED UPON 
ME EVERY MORNING, EVERY NOON, 
EVERY NIGHT. 
>> IF NOBODY CLAIMS THE REWARD 
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FUND. 
>> WHAT WE PUT TOGETHER WAS 
THOSE FUNDS THAT OWNERS WOULD 
HAVE A CHASE THROUGH THE 
PROCESS TO MAKE IT THROUGH TO 
MAKE IT BACK. 
IF NOT THE FUNDS WOULD THEN 
ROLL INTO MOLLIE TIBBETTS 
FAMILY AND WITH CRIMESTOPPERS 
AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME A 
DECISION WOULD BE MADE WHETHER 
IT BE A MEMORIAL IF WE GOT TO 
THAT PLACE OR AN ON GOING DEAL. 
THERE'S A TWO YEAR LIMIT ON IT 
RIGHT NOW. 
THEY ACTUALLY WHEN WE PUT 
TOGETHER FOR THAT FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS GOT TO $150,000. 
WE STILL HAVE THAT SITTING IN A 
SIDE ACCOUNT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW 
THAT WAS SET-UP WAS TO ROLL 
INTO A GENERAL ACCOUNT. 
THIS WILL ROLL BACK INTO THE 
FAMILY AND CRIMESTOPPERS AND 
THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION TO DO 
IT. 
>> MY QUESTION IS FOR DALTON. 
THIS WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND OF THE 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO 
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE-- 
>> YOU KNOW, IF THEY'RE 
LISTENING THEN I WOULD JUST 
LIKE THEM TO KNOW THAT IMAGINE 
THIS WAS YOU. 
EVERYBODY HAS A MOLLIE IN THEIR 
LIFE, A PERSON THAT AFFECTED 
THEM IN A WAY THAT SHE AFFECTED 
EVERYBODY STANDING UP HERE 
RIGHT NOW AND IMAGINE IF THIS 
WAS YOU, SOMEBODY HAD TAKEN 
YOUR MOLLIE. 
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO HELP? 
WOULDN'T YOU WANT HER BACK? 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL JUST DO THE 
RIGHT THING AND LET HER GO 
PRETTY MUCH. 
>> DID YOU SAY WHETHER OR NOT 
YOU THINK MOLLIE WAS ABDUCTED 
AT THIS POINT? 
>> I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON 
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAVE 
HAPPENED BUT I DO THINK SHE'S 
OUT THERE AND I THINK WE CAN 
BRING HER HOME. 
AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS 
A COMMUNITY TO DO THAT, TO DO 
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AND 
EVERYONE IN THE MEDIA IS DOING 
WHAT THEY CAN DO, REALLY 
FANTASTIC. 
FEELS GREAT TO OUR FAMILY. 
EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY IS 
DOING IT. 
AND SO I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE 
COUNTRY HAS ADOPTED MOLLIE. 
SO LET'S KEEP AT IT. 
LET'S GO GET HER. 
>> ONE THING TO ADD IS 
ADVERTISE SOME OF THE CRIME 
STOPPER INFORMATION ABOUT 200 
TIPS WENT IN AND ARE PRETTY 
MUCH IMMEDIATELY TO 
AUTHORITIES. 
ANY TIME WE GET A TIP FROM 
CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, MISSOURI 
WHEN THAT TIP COMES IN IT IS 
ROUTED TO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCY IN THAT AREA DONE PRETTY 
MUCH IMMEDIATELY. 
I DO HAVE THE STATEMENT THAT 
LAURA HAD SHADE YOU WANTED A 
HARD COPY OF IT TOO AND THEY'LL 
BE UP HERE FOR YOU. 
>> ONE LAST AND-- 
>> WELL IT'S KIND OF A PARALLEL 
EFFORT. 
THIS WAS A FUND RAISING EFFORT. 
IF WE THROUGH RAISING FUNDS CAN 
GET OTHER INDIVIDUALS TO 
CONTACT US WHICH MEANS THEY ARE 
CONTACTING THE I OBJECT 
CONTACTING THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT AS FAR AS GETTING 
WITH THEM AND HAVING A STRATEGY 
THE FAMILY AND CRIMESTOPPERS WE 
BASICALLY STEPPED UP AND DID IT 
ON OUR OWN. 
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS WE 
PLAY. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES A GREAT 
JOB INVESTIGATING BUT THEY ARE 
NOT IN THE FUND RAISING 
BUSINESS. 
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK A WHILE TO 
TRY TO GET THIS MOMENTUM GOING. 
I DON'T ANTICIPATE OVERALL OF 
THE YEARS I'VE INVOLVED 
CRIMESTOPPERS AND ALL OF THE 
OTHER ORGANIZATION THAT HAVE 
FACILITATED WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT THERE REALLY ISN'T 
ANY DAMAGE THAT COULD BE DONE 
OTHER THAN WE ARE GOING TO GET 
A LOT MORE TIPS AND GREAT TIPS. 
OUT OF THOSE IT 200 IF YOU GET 
HALF OF THEM THAT REALLY TRULY 
HAVE SUBSTANCE THAT'S PROBABLY 
NOT TOO BAD. 
YOU GET GOOFY PEOPLE DOING 
GOOFY THINGS BUT WE'LL FIGURE 
THAT OUT AFTER THE FACT. 
AND IF YOU ARE AAFRAID TO COME 
FORWARD WE GUARANTY THAT THE 
INFORMATION YOU GIVE US WILL GO 
ALONG AND THEY WON'T KNOW WHO 
YOU ARE AND IF THERE'S A REWARD 
INVOLVED YOU'LL HAVE YOUR TIP 
NUMBER AND CONTACT US BACK AND 
WE'LL GET YOU WHAT YOU NEED. 
IF THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS I 
GUESS AT THIS POINT IN TIME YOU 
CAN PICK UP THE HARD COPY OF 
WHAT LAURA READND THE ORIGINAL. 
I CAN LEAVE A BUSINESS CARD AND 
YOU CAN CONTACT ME BY E-MAIL. 
>>>  WE'VE JUST BEEN LISTENING 
TO THE FAMILY OF MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS. 
SHE'S THE 20-YEAR-OLD IOWA 
WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 
TWO WEEKS. 
THE FAMILY SAID THEY DO BELIEVE 
SHE IS ALIVE AND USED THE NEWS 
CONFERENCE TODAY TO ANNOUNCE A 
REWARD FUND THAT HAS BEEN SET-
UP IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
CRIMESTOPPERS. 
THE FUND IS NOTCH AT $172,000 
THAT WILL BE PAID OUT TO ANYONE 
WHO GIVES AN ANONYMOUS TIP THAT 
LEADS TO MOLLIE COMING HOME 
SAFELY. 
LAURA ALDER WOOD SAID THE BRING 
MOLLIE TIBBETTS HOME SAFE 
REWARD FUND. 
MOLLIE'S FATHER IN RESPONSE A 
QUESTION FROM A REPORTER ABOUT 
HOW THE FAMILY IS DOING SAID 
THE FAMILY IS HOLDING UP JUST 
FINE. 
THIS IS A FIGHT TO GET OUR 
DAUGHTER BACK AND THIS IS GOING 
TO BE SOLVED BY SOMEONE COMING 
FORWARD. 
THIS IS A WAY TO ENCOURAGE 
ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE ANY 
INFORMATION AT ALL TO COME 
FORWARD REPORTED ANONYMOUSLY 
THROUGH CRIMESTOPPERS. 
THEY AND INVESTIGATORS ARE 
HOPING THAT ONE OF THESE TIPS 
CAN LEAD TO MOLLIE'S LOCATION. 
THAT IS THE BRING MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS HOME SAFE REWARD FUND 
AT $172,000 AND ANYONE CAN CALL 
CRIMESTOPPERS ANONYMOUSLY WITH 
INFORMATION IF THEY BELIEVE 
THEY HAVE ANY INFORMATION
