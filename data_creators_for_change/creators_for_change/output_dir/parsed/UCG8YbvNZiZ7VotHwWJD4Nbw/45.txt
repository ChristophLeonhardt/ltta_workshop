guest Addie is going to be guiding us
step by step of course into what what
what things would be essential for us to
to brand ourselves properly so Eddie
what would be the starting point will be
a good starting point for this okay I
think first we have to know why personal
branding is important personal branding
is important because first off it gives
you an identity right so basically it is
a representation of what you have to
offer and this is what you per truth of
the world another reason it's important
it's because it gives you direction
having your own brand and deciding on
what your brand is can really help you
when it comes to picking projects okay
doing events or appearances and
basically just every step of you and
your career your personal brand it can
help you make a decision as to which
direction to go
people see selling yourself as something
negative when if you think about the
world we have today there are so many
ways to sell yourself and selling
yourself doesn't necessarily mean you
know you ask for money for I don't know
some sort of thing it's it's basically
just shaping your identity right now and
that's already considered selling
yourself it has you're trying to provide
you're trying to create this presence of
yourself somewhere and of course the
most common platform print out this one
line right yes that is the easiest place
for you to reshape your identity because
it's free
