as Trump kicks to PLO out of Washington and cuts funding to Palestinian refugees is this the moment Benjamin Netanyahu claims victory I'll challenge one of these railey Prime Minister's closest allies I'm mayor the Husson also on the show the Chinese government denies allegations it's holding up to a million Weger Muslims in detention camps and says it's facing a threat from extremists and separatists but how can that justify such astonishingly repressive measures that's our debate but first the Israeli government has that much to celebrate this year from the u.s. embassy moved to Jerusalem to a trump administration that's firmly in Israel's corner and continues to penalize the Palestinians so has Netanyahu won this week's headliner former israeli foreign ministry chief and close ally of the prime minister Dorie Gould Dorie Gould thanks for joining me on upfront in the last couple of weeks the United States government the Trump administration has cut funding to the UN refugee agency which looks after Palestinian refugees has cut funding to Palestinian cancer patients has shut down the Washington DC mission of the PLO the representative body of the Palestinian people you must be delighted we don't get delighted in the problems of the Palestinians you know for us it would be better that these issues not happen and that we could just sit and negotiate and reach an agreement a lot of this is self-inflicted punishment on the part of the Palestinians they knew that if they start playing around with the International Criminal Court there is American legislation that was adopted in 2015 which says that will have implications for their offices in Washington that wasn't a donald trump invention that was done back then you say you want to solve the conflict your former ambassador to Washington DC Israeli politician Michael Oren says quote the Americans are punishing the Palestinians in order to make them return to the table what table is that by the way because there doesn't seem to be anything to return to what are you willing to actually offer the Palestinians an actual State well we're not going to start negotiating on television and Michael Oren has his interpretation and it's legitimate mine is a little bit different I have ideas and I've sat with Palestinians for years talking about alternative models for solving this problem let us get to a table and let us put those ideas out and let's try and resolve this once and for all in once very important sense what President Trump is doing he's trying to introduce realism don't start believing that you didn't get five million refugees to return to Israel it's not going to happen and if you start believing that propaganda you'll never negotiate a solution which people are gonna accept being treated like this year after year decade after decade as the Palestinians have you're only going to make them much more nationalistic than they already were by treating them in this fashion in my view the important way to move forward is to address the issue of dignity the dignity the Palestinians is more important than the amount of land we're talking about so frankly that's my point of departure it's different than people who just say it's a matter of a percentage well it's easy to say the percentage of territory don't matter when you control hundred percent of the territory but just to be clear because I know most members of the Israeli cabinet don't support a two-state solution the Prime Minister himself your former boss your friend Netanyahu has said he is only offering a quote unquote state- to the Palestinians so what is your position Dori Gold do you support a two-state solution and this isn't about negotiating on TV do you support in principle a two-state solution as the end goal to this process quote unquote yes or no I would rather not answer that but I will say that Palestinian self-government does not frighten me I know I don't want to just put things into slogans we have to sit down and work this out right now we now have new regional players who can have a very constructive role I'm talking about the Arab states there's a whole question of of developing facilities for Gaza it mostly can be in Palestinian sovereign territory in the Gaza Strip and Gaza occupied according to the UN it's very difficult most people in the world in most governments of the world including in former Israeli governments said they support a two-state solution or they don't support a two-state solution it's a very simple question do you support a two-state solution I'm gonna take your silences no you don't know I have no problem with the powers in state as long as we have defensible borders for Israel and a arrangement that protects religious pluralism in the whole area I don't want to go into further detail than that but I think that we have to retain our vital Defense needs and that is not a simple solution the international community shouldn't judge us it shouldn't build up Palestinian expectations that Israel is going to do a striptease and get rid of all the territory it captured in a war of self-defence in 67 it has to come up with I think the international community would say that giving up occupied territory there's a like strip sticking with international law but just on the peace plan itself you can't seriously believe that the three people Donald Trump has put in charge of coming up with a peace plan his son-in-law Jared Kushner his former real estate and bankruptcy lawyers David Freedman and Jason Greenblatt none of whom have any experience in diplomacy or peacemaking all of whom are hardcore supporters of illegal settlements two of them have even given money to settlements that's that's the trio that's gonna bring peace to the Middle East seriously you know Jimmy Carter had a secretary of state whose name was Cyrus Vance and he came from the world of Wall Street law firms so you know everybody comes from somewhere the question is whether they have a capacity to listen to come up with creative answers and to keep everybody on board right now everybody who claims that he's knowledgeable about the Middle East has utterly failed there has not been a successful American Peace Initiative really I would say since Camp David with Egypt it's not just about their complete lack of knowledge in qualifications also their blatant bias as plenty of people even in Washington DC of pointed out the u.s. at least pretended to be an honest broker has never been an honest broker Brit please pretended now it doesn't even bother would you be okay if the US government sent three Arab Americans or conservative Muslim Americans who donated money to Palestinian groups to be their main negotiators on this conflict you'd lose your minds in Israel if that happened I look at the behavior of an individual I don't look at what Cardin yeah the behavior is they gave money to illegal settlements how can they be negotiators between Palestine and the Israeli government would you accept negotiators like that if you were a Palestinian what after here and here I'm out I speak with Palestinians I have negotiated Palestinians in 1996 i sat with Abu Mazen for hours in Martin and Dick's house in Hertz Aliyah and you know we can work solutions not solve everything but if we show each other respect and if we're serious we can move forward doriga I want to talk about Prime Minister Netanyahu himself you've been a close ally of his for many years now some would say that Netanyahu quite like strongmen and dictators and authoritarian leaders even of the anti-semitic variety he recently cozied up to Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban who's praised Hungary's pro-nazi World War two government who traffics an anti-semitic conspiracy theories he just hosted Philippine president rodrigo duterte who's happily compared himself to hitler is this really the company now that the Israeli prime minister keeps you know we are trying to broaden our international connections all around the world in Asia in Africa in Latin America and prime minister has led a an amazing effort to do that you know there's a big difference between Viktor Orban and the anti-semitic party that runs in the parliament you know you can't you can't give everybody the same a broad-brush he prays and he prays the Hungarian leader who worked with the Nazis mikl√≥s horthy are you okay with that now no I don't like that but you know what around the world you have all kinds of governments which you know have all kinds of understandings of history that you don't agree with you have to express your view it's important to stand up in Hungary and talk about the lessons of the Holocaust but you don't have to agree with everything that it's the Viktor Orban has said some would say that it's not a surprise this stance of Netanyahu is given he himself made racist comments about Arab voters coming out to vote in droves during the last election and Israel is becoming a more and more racist place some would say the nation state law for example controversially passed over the summer says quote the right to exercise national self-determination in Israel is unique to the Jewish people only it makes Hebrew the country's official language downgrades the status of Arabic and establishes Jewish settlement as a national value without mentioning a single word about equality or minority rights well I suggest you read the Balfour Declaration which envisions a Jewish homeland it didn't talk about an Arab homeland did that mean that Lord Balfour and the British government were racist prejudicial or they were trying to help out a people who had been downtrodden who had lost their ancient homeland but were determined to recover it many would argue Lord Balfour was anti-semitic in his past but the point is that many Israeli politicians voted against this law because they don't see it as in line with Jewish history or even with Israeli history this is a new and very right-wing move plenty of Israeli politicians voted against it Israeli Palestinian legislators called it apartheid members of your own Parliament even the bipartisan head of the Israeli democracy Institute condemned it as an unnecessary embarrassment to Israel it's jingoistic and divisive well you know as director-general of Ministry of Foreign Affairs I led Israeli delegations to South Africa I sat with the foreign minister of South Africa and no one calls us an apartheid state because they understand the real suffering under apartheid and they don't want to you know brand us with that accusation and they know that in apartheid South Africa there were hospitals for blacks and hospitals for whites you've got to be emergency room and Hadassah Hospital and you will see Jewish doctors taking care of Arab patients and the other way around we are not an apartheid state we are a state with equality for all people that's completely false what you just said plenty of senior ANC politicians South African anti-apartheid campaigners have called Israel an apartheid state Desmond Tutu has talked about seeing apartheid on the ground when he visited Israel in the occupied territories but put that to one side whether it's apartheid or not what would you call a country in which one group of people have an exclusive right to self-determination based on race and religion and 20 percent of the population doesn't what do you call that country if not apartheid because that's what your nation state law is enshrined a nation state law has nothing new in it it has to do with constitutional problems we have in Israel intervened in the debate come on dori gold you're misleading the audience you know it was a hugely controversial law the president of your country intervened to condemn an earlier version of it please do not say this is just some uncontroversial continuation of the Balfour Declaration don't insult our intelligence no it is an internal debate it is a legitimate internal debate that has to do with the powers of the Supreme Court and its effect specifically the Jewish people in Israel have a right to self-determination where does that leave the 20% of the population who are Palestinian I think that the law is there to make clear that Israel is the National homeland of the Jewish people that's and that's why it was set up a very specific question or a goal do Palestinians in Israel have a right to self-determination where are they second-class citizens behind the Jews who have an exclusive a unique right is what the law says to self-determination a unique right for one group of people the State of Israel was set up originally because the Jews had been so discriminated against and so oppressed in countries leading up to the Holocaust that there had to be one homeland one place where they could claim a right of self-determination that's all that law was referring to so do you deny Palestinian self-determination inside of Israel Palestinian cities of Israel have no right to self-determination you agree with the law on that yeah I would say I would deny the rights of Canadians to have self-determination inside the United States I would deny the rights of Mexicans they have a right of self-determination in some Palestinians so you're now telling us on this TV show that one-fifth of the population of Israel are foreigners they are equivalent to Canadians living in the United States that's quite an admission I've interviewed Israelis for years and I've always been told by Israeli spokesmen everyone's equal in Israel you're now saying no Palestinians are the equivalent of Canadians in America that's an astonishing statement well I am saying we have a state for the Jewish people that has been established we have to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and there will be a Palestinian national entity where their national self expression can be fully expressed just to be clear dori gold I don't want to put words in your mouth just to be very clear are you saying that the one-fifth of the Israeli population who are Palestinians who you told me a moment ago are equally treated in Israeli hospitals that they should leave to go to a Palestinian state now under this law I didn't say that I didn't say they have to leave this is going to be a state it is a state for the Jewish people that will give equality to others who live here whether they are Palestinian or sense whether they are Druze or whatever their national and religious background Dori gold will have to leave it there thank you for joining me on upfront in what's been said to resemble a massive internment camp shrouded in secrecy China has been accused of detaining up to 1 million Weger Muslims in its Xin Jiang region under what UN experts have called a pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism over the past decade human rights groups have documented widespread repression of this Turkic ethnic minority from banning religious customs to forcing wiegert's to change their Muslim names and attend communist party rallies Beijing however denies allegations of mass detentions and discrimination it says strict security measures in Xin Jiang are aimed at preserving stability and preventing deadly attacks but is the government crackdown only going to lead to more unrest and more violence and other weak is really a threat to Chinese national security joining me to discuss this on nore Turkel chairman of the Weger Human Rights Project in Washington DC and from Beijing Victor Gao vice-president of the center for China and globalization a Chinese think-tank thank you both for joining me in the arena Victor let me start with you hundreds of thousands of we gas perhaps up to a million according to UN investigators have been detained in the Xin Jiang region without trial without charge in re-education camps how on earth can anyone justify that no such allegation is completely groundless and I think they are designed to mislead the world the Weagle people are a very important minority one of the 56 ethnic groups in China and they are a proud member of the Chinese nation and I personally have many wigle friends here in Beijing as well as a many cities in Xinjiang to say that the wiegel people are a threat to the Chinese nation that's completely ungrounded again indeed there are small groups of wigle extremists who want to achieve so-called independence for King John for example they are related to the overseas terrorist groups they fight in Afghanistan against the American troops against our NATO troops now they fight in Syria for example these people are not only a threat to China but also a threat to the United States and to NATO and to many countries in the world therefore I think we need to close ranks to fight against this particular terroristic groups among the wiggled a gas analogy nuri the united nations claims the amnesty climate about mass detentions are all groundless says victor if that's what they claim why don't they allow independent observers media to get access as you may know BuzzFeed a reporter reporting on China won The Weavers in China just kicked out of the country what are they hiding for Victor we have satellite imagery showing that there are camps they are growing in size are we not supposed to believe our own lying eyes now I think the reports do not exist in line with the realities in Xinjiang altogether there are about six or seven million legal people you are talking about let's say 1 billion for the 6 or 7 million we go people in Xinjiang that's ludicrous these are the facts these are misleading things try to do few try to confuse the world Noorie it is undeniable there have been deadly attacks carried out in China by Weger groups including by the so called Turkistan Islamic party which the EU the UK the US have all designated a terrorist organization the Chinese government isn't making it up the security threat is it let me make it very clear every country has a right to defend itself end of the story period but locking up few million people in concentration camps under the claim of achieving social stability national security is it doesn't make any sense when you look at who they have been holding up you would be surprised the population pool we have religious leaders we have a humanitarian individuals who flan through fist the business leaders we have a people in academia New York Times just report that 52 years old anthropologists have been disappeared we have Ilham tohti that evicted the economist economy civil society also has nothing actually there's only you can only spin so much the victor is trying very well let's bring by let's bring Victor back in let me ask Vic to this Victor what is the security justification for banning eager parents from naming their sons Muhammad banning Weger children from entering mosques banning government employees in xingyang from fasting during Ramadan banning men from growing quote abnormally long beard how is that not state-sponsored persecution and discrimination against weaker Muslims not based on my personal experience and observation what you said is not the truth in mosques are very very useful it's specifically sanctions their normal behaviors such as growing beard carrying Islamic names even marrying weaker people is considered extremist in that law you can read that law and also as you know there is a law that governs counterterrorism issues the Chinese government not only violating its international obligation but also violating its all domestic laws Constitution and criminal procedures even counterterrorism law so you cannot deny Victor let's be honest your government is violating their own laws period I know the importance of law is in China I really hope everyone respects the law however in Xinjiang the major threat we face is terrorism and extremism and separatism and I think the authorities have a right to make sure that the innocent people are not harmed and that extreme version of religion of all kinds is not penetrating through the population and then people cannot misuse religion as an excuse to stir up trouble to destabilize and to bring the society to a halt and I think that people are justified to that let me ask you this Marie Victor keeps talking about separators of being a threat we know you said you don't support terrorism most weekers don't support terrorism but on the issue of separatism our organizations like your own and other Weger organizations around the world are they only campaigning for the human rights of we girls living in Xin Jiang who according to all human rights groups and UN officials are having their human rights abused or you going a step further oh you say actually we want an independent so-called East Turkestan which existed perhaps for a few years in late 1940 is that what you're calling for because if you are then it's understandable at least the Chinese government aren't gonna tolerate that most governments democratic or otherwise aren't okay with separatist groups trying to break up because how to use a Google wouldn't know what the organization that I work with stands for we've worked to achieve the wiggers right to self-determination through peaceful and democratic Musee self-determination what does that mean you do want an independent our affairs we want to be treated with respect or anything do you want an independent state separate from China yep very quite maybe we just wanted to have independent state can you understand the Chinese government like many other governments aren't gonna be okay with that Chinese government in a way creating a anti colonial resistance among the weekers with their ruthless policies okay let's put that point in to Victor do you get that point Victor that you're driving wiggers more into the arms of extreme groups separatist groups making them much more anti colonial listen there are three evils in Xinjiang and three evils involving certain parts of the wiegel minorities that is separatism terrorism and extremism and there are extreme elements among the Wiegel people who want to let's say achieve so-called independence of Xinjiang in China according to the Chinese law this is treason this is separatism very straightforward question now if you lock people up if you treat them like enemies of the state to quote UN investigators is that not more likely to make them upset angry and more less likely to be want to be part of China it's pretty straightforward no I think we need to be realistic and pragmatic as well as philosophical I think very important are justified literally Spanish or mystery novels cannot be tolerated okay do you accept any mistreatment of the wiggers in Xin Jiang do you think everything's fine I says three evils DT do you think everyone fine and in there because one Chinese official said the we go Swinton's Indiana the happiest Muslims in the world do you agree with that rather absurd statement the we go people are a very proud member of the Chinese nation they are very important part of the Chinese civilization they are believing Islam the majority of the people here in China more or less believe in Buddhism we have different faiths that's a reality however they are your government to the Chinese nation get ourselves in here sisters Victor be honest your government that's his official line treating and perceiving we Islam as a mental disease listen listen to me if I practice or believe in three evils I'll be arrested I may be detained I may be sentenced to too many years in which you cannot practice extremism separatism and terrorist we're not talking about that Singapore University perfect is that economy expensive best oh sorry a slayer musician be legal consequences okay we're gonna have to wrap it up one final question to you nuri isn't the problem for the wiggers that even when the United Nations investigators come out and say there may be a million people may have been detained the world isn't really gonna do much are they because the Chinese governors are the kind of government you could push around or sanction or intimidate Muslim majority countries aren't gonna care about the weaker Muslims because they've got financial and trade deals with China investment deals what actually do you expect the international community to do they can do a lot of stuff number one they can sanction those politicians and political leaders in China who are responsible for the egregious human rights violations taking place today in number two they should use its international influence China still cares about its international image the face-saving is a huge concern for the Chinese government using engagement using legal tools available but their disposal and also perhaps linking the human rights issue the wicker issue to de trade a dialogue might be a possible solution in the short term Noorie we'll have to leave it there nore Terkel victor GAO thank you both for joining me in the arena to debate very controversial issue that sounds show up front we'll be back next week you
