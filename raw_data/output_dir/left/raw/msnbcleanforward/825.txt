171
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:11,107
STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE’S MOUTH. THIS IS THE OPPOSITE.

172
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:15,044

178
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:27,023

179
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:28,925
PAUL MANAFORT WANTED TO DO PROFFER SESSIONS, IF HE WANTS TO

180
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:31,294
PROFFER SESSIONS, IF HE WANTS TO GET SOMETHING BACK FOR ALL THIS,

181
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,496
GET SOMETHING BACK FOR ALL THIS, WOULDN’T HE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF

182
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:33,830
WOULDN’T HE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF DOING THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF

183
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:35,432
DOING THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS RATHER THAN AFTER

184
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,833
THIS PROCESS RATHER THAN AFTER HE GOT ONE CONVICTION IN ONE

185
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:37,133
HE GOT ONE CONVICTION IN ONE TRIAL?

186
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:37,501
TRIAL? >> YEAH.

187
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:39,136
>> YEAH. HE ROLLED THE DICE.

188
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,137
HE ROLLED THE DICE. I THINK BEFORE THAT VIRGINIA

189
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,638
I THINK BEFORE THAT VIRGINIA TRIAL HE SAID TO HIMSELF, LOOK,

190
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,206
TRIAL HE SAID TO HIMSELF, LOOK, I’M GOING TO ROLL THE DICE.

191
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,208
I’M GOING TO ROLL THE DICE. IF I WIN IN VIRGINIA, I’LL GO ON

192
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,743
IF I WIN IN VIRGINIA, I’LL GO ON AND FIGHT IT IN D.C.

193
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,878
AND FIGHT IT IN D.C. I’LL ROLL THE DICE THERE.

194
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,647
I’LL ROLL THE DICE THERE. IF I ROLL 12 OR THE BEST ROLL

195
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:55,152
IF I ROLL 12 OR THE BEST ROLL HE WALKS.

196
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:55,852
HE WALKS. GHETS

197
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:56,954
GHETS HE GETS A FREE PASS.

198
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:58,622
HE GETS A FREE PASS. HE HAS DONE THE ONLY AVENUE HE

199
00:06:58,656 --> 00:06:59,923
HE HAS DONE THE ONLY AVENUE HE HAD LEFT WHICH IS TO WALK INTO

200
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:00,957
HAD LEFT WHICH IS TO WALK INTO THE PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE.

201
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,926
THE PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE. IT WAS MY OPINION THAT THE

202
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:03,727
IT WAS MY OPINION THAT THE PROSECUTOR’S WOULD STILL TAKE

203
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:04,428
PROSECUTOR’S WOULD STILL TAKE HIM IN.

204
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:06,663
HIM IN. THEY VIEW HIM AS JUST THAT

205
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:07,464
THEY VIEW HIM AS JUST THAT IMPORTANT FOR THE TRUMP TOWER

206
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:10,667
IMPORTANT FOR THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING AND MANY OTHER THINGS.

207
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:13,603
MEETING AND MANY OTHER THINGS. THE ONLY EX-FACTOR THAT

208
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:14,671
THE ONLY EX-FACTOR THAT COMPLICATED THINGS WAS THIS IDEA

209
00:07:14,672 --> 00:00:00,000
COMPLICATED THINGS WAS THIS IDEA OF A PARDON.
