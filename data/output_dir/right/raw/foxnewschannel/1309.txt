00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,933
THAT AT LEAST THE ATMOSPHERE

33
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,434
WAS FLIRTATIOUS.

34
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:06,268
THE WOMAN CLAIMS SHE WAS

35
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:08,470
DRUNK AND UNABLE TO GIVE

36
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:08,804

37
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:10,072
HE SAYS SHE WAS NOT

38
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:11,106

00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:17,580
TROUBLE KEEPING HER BALANCE.

43
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,981
KEITH CLAIMS THE WOMAN

44
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,249
OPPOSED HIM USING A CONDOM

45
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,384
AND THEY DID NOT HAVE SEX.

46
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:23,886
THE WOMAN CLAIMS SHE WAS

00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:24,920
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND FILED

48
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,088
A CLAIM WITH CAMPUS POLICE

49
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:27,022
THE NEXT DAY.

50
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:29,191
NOW, REMEMBER, MITCH BEGAN

51
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,326
STATE FOLLOWS THE SO-CALLED

52
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:32,060
DEAR COLLEAGUE GUIDELINES

53
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,629
ISSUED DURING THE OBAMA

54
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:34,096
ADMINISTRATION.

55
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:35,664
SO INSTEAD OF USING THE

56
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:38,600
LEGAL GUILT STANDARD OF

57
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,401
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT,

58
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,435
THE UNIVERSITY THRESHOLD IS

59
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,337
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.

60
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:43,939
AND UNDER THE DEAR COLLEAGUE

61
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,841
POLICY, THE ACCUSED IS NOT

62
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,275
ALLOWED TO QUESTION THE

63
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:47,609
ACCUSER.

64
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,944
AND YET, DESPITE THAT AFTER

65
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,078
MONTHS OF INVESTIGATING THE

66
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:56,418
UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT

67
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:57,886
MUMPHRYEY FOUND HE DID NOT

68
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:58,753
VIOLATE POLICY.

69
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:00,355
EVEN THE PROSECUTOR DECIDED

70
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:02,023
NOT TO FILE CHARGES CITING A

71
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:02,958
LACK OF EVIDENCE AND

72
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,159
COOPERATION BY THE ACCUSER.

73
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,493
UNLIKE A COURT OF LAW WHERE

74
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:06,461
A NOT GUILTY VERDICT CANNOT

75
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,463
BE RETRIED, TITLE 9

76
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,198
INVESTIGATIONS DO ALLOW

77
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,399
DOUBLE JEOPARDY.

78
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:15,737
SO THE WOMAN APPEALS

79
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:16,738
MUMPHREY'S AQUUTTLE AND

80
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,073
MICHIGAN STATE REOPENS THE

81
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:18,373

88
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,082
BACK OPEN AND DOES NOT OFFER

89
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:27,649
A DEFENSE.

90
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,651
IN MARCH OF 2017, THE

91
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,785

92
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,587

MISCONDUCT.

00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:38,960
BECAUSE IS HE BANNED FROM

00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:42,063
FINISH HIS GRADUATE DEGREE.

100
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:43,898
HE HAS NOW FILED A LAWSUIT

101
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:44,899
AGAINST MICHIGAN STATE,

102
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:45,834
ALLEGING THE UNIVERSITY HAS

JOB PROSPECTS, AMONG OTHER

105
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:51,306
THINGS.

106
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,141
WE REACHED OUT TO MSU FOR A

107
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:53,474
COMMENT.

108
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,610
SO FAR NO RESPONSE.

109
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,010
MARTHA.

110
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,678
>> Martha: TRACE, THANK YOU

111
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:57,045
VERY MUCH.

112
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,012
HERE NOW FORMER MICHIGAN

113
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,415
STATE AND EX-NFL PLAYER

114
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:04,952
CHRIS MUMPHREY.

115
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,220
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THE

116
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,054
TOUGH QUESTION FIRST.

117
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,122
DID YOU SEXUALLY ASSAULT

118
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:08,923
THIS WOMAN?

119
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,493
>> NO, MA'AM.

120
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:13,127
>> Martha: WHAT HAPPENED

121
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:15,496
THAT NIGHT?

122
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,131
>> SHE INVITED ME OVER TO

123
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:17,832
HER ROOM.

124
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:22,670
I ACTUALLY MET HER THROUGH

125
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,004
TINDER.

126
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,372
SHE INVITED ME OVER TO HER

127
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:24,839
ROOM.

128
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,040
SENT ME A FEW PICTURES.

129
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,575
SHE TOLD ME WANTED ME TO

130
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,910
COME OVER WHEN HER ROOMMATES

131
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,211
LEAVE.

132
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,145
I CAME OVER.

133
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:31,645
ROOMMATES LEFT.

134
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,947
IT WAS ME AND HER THERE AS

135
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,482
SOON AS I GOT IN THERE SHE

136
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:35,416
STARTED UNDRESSING ME.

137
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,051
SHE BASICALLY MADE IT KNOWN,

138
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,953
YOU KNOW, WHAT SHE WANTED TO

139
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:39,920
DO.

140
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,988
SO FAST FORWARD A LITTLE

141
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,090
BIT, WE GOT TO A SITUATION

142
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,859
AND THE SITUATION WAS ABOUT

143
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:45,326
THE CONDOM.

144
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,927
I TOLD HER I DID NOT HAVE

145
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,061
SEX WITHOUT A CONDOM.

146
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,664
SO THAT'S WHEN SHE FLIPPED.

147
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,534
EVERYTHING JUST WENT SOUTH.

148
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,569
SO I BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,

149
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,137
TOLD HER LIKE HEY, IT'S TIME

150
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,239
FOR ME TO LEAVE.

151
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,275
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

152
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,476
I BASICALLY SAID I'M GOING

153
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,077
TO HAVE TO LEAVE.

154
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,178
I'M BLACK AND YOU ARE WHITE.

155
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,346
I TOLD HER THAT.

156
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,514
AND I LEFT.

157
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,448
AND THAT WAS THE END OF

158
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,083
THAT.

159
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,451
>> Martha: SO YOU NEVER HAD

160
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,719
SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH THIS

161
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,020
WOMAN?

162
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,754
>> NO, MA'AM.

163
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,354
I NEVER DID.

164
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,789
NO, MA'AM.

165
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,490
>> Martha: IS IT TRUE THAT

166
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,991
YOU SAY ONE OF YOUR SIBLINGS

167
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,959
HAD A BABY AT A YOUNG AGE

168
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,994
AND THAT'S ALWAYS YOUR

169
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,263
POLICY IN TERMS OF BIRTH

170
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:23,597
CONTROL?

171
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,798
>> YES.

172
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,565
I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS.

173
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,900
SO I MEAN, I'M NOT GOING TO

174
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,802
HAVE ANY KIDS UNTIL I'M

175
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,136
MARRIED.

176
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,370
THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN

177
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,605
REASONS.

178
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,306
>> Martha: SO YOU THINK THAT

179
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,406
ALL OF THIS IS BEHIND YOU

180
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,374
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL FOUND YOU

181
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,142
NOT GUILTY.

182
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,276
THE PROSECUTOR DROPPED THE

183
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:36,610
CHARGES.

184
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,844
AFTER THEY LOOKED AT IT AND

185
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,612
SAID YOU KNOW, THERE IS

186
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,246
NOTHING HERE.

187
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,347
WE ARE NOT MOVING FORWARD.

188
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,314
DID YOU GO OFF TO BEGIN YOUR

189
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,183
LIFE AND YOUR DREAM AS A

190
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,451
PLAYER FOR THE HOUSTON

191
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:44,784
TEXANS.

192
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,453
AND SUDDENLY YOU GO BACK TO

193
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,288
PLAY IN A GOLF TOURNAMENT AT

194
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
MICHIGAN STATE AND SUDDENLY

195
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
SOMEONE COMES UP TO YOU AND

196
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,993
SAYS YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE

197
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:53,960
PROPERTY NOW SHE APPEALED

198
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,261
YOUR CASE AND NOW WE DECIDED

199
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,062
YOU ARE GUILTY?

200
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,430
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

201
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,300
>> I WAS HURT.

202
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,936
MY FEELINGS WERE CRUSHED.

203
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,536
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU

204
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,871
THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?

205
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,673
BECAUSE THE STORY COMES OUT

206
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,707
IN THE DETROIT FREE PRESS

207
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,541
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

208
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,409
THEY CALL YOU INTO THE

209
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,144
OFFICE OF THE TEXANS?

210
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,179
>> YOU KNOW, BASICALLY, THEY

211
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,383
TELL ME THAT, YOU KNOW, BAD

212
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,887
PRESS, AND WE HAVE ZERO

213
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,322
TOLERANCE WITH THIS.

214
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,857
>> Martha: SO ANDREW

215
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,525
MILTONBURG, DOES HE HAVE A

216
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:25,825
CASE?

217
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,893
CAN HE TURN HIS LIFE AROUND?

218
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,527
>> ABSOLUTELY.

219
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,828
I THINK THE NFL SHOULD

220
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,797
WELCOME HIM BACK AND GIVE

221
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,631
HIM AN OPPORTUNITY.

222
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,032
HE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A

223
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,067
VICTIM OF A TERRIBLE

224
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,904
INJUSTICE.

225
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,605
TREMENDOUS HARDSHIP AND SUCH

226
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,873
TERRIFIC ODDS IN HIS LIFE TO

227
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,276
MAKE IT TO THE PINNACLE OF

228
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:45,578
HIS DREAMS.

229
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:54,220
ALL TO HAVE IT RIPPED AWAY

230
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,454
YEARS AFTER HE LEFT THE

231
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:56,422
SCHOOL FOR ALLEGATIONS HE

232
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,759
WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR

233
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,260
PREVIOUSLY.

234
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,861
>> Martha: KEITH, DO YOU

235
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,129
THINK RACE PLAYS A ROLE IN

236
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,163
ANY PART OF THIS?

237
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,265
>> I WOULD SAY TO A CERTAIN

238
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,368
EXTENT, YES.

239
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,071
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN YOU

240
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,239
LOOK AT IT, I'M BLACK AND

241
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:20,012
SHE IS WHITE.

242
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,814
I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE

243
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,715
NEVER HAPPENED.

244
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:28,854
I FEEL LIKE IT HURT -- IT

245
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:29,221
HURTS.

246
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,222
IT HURTS.

247
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:30,989
>> Martha: I CAN IMAGINE.

248
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:41,433
YOUR LIFE WAS DERAILED AND.

249
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,201
ANDREW, WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN

250
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,268
IN THIS CASE.

251
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,237
SHE HAS NOT COME FORWARD AND

252
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,204
TALKED ABOUT IT.

253
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:47,806
>> SHE HAS CLAIMED SOME SORT

254
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:48,306
OF TRAUMA.

255
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:49,508

00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:52,711
