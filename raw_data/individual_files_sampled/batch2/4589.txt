we are joined now by phone by Michael avenatti to get his first reaction to the president saying tonight to Sean Hannity on Fox News that Donald Trump reimbursed Michael Cullen for the hunt for the hundred thirty thousand dollars of that Michael Cohen paid to stormy Daniels let's listen to that exchange in the interview having something to do with paying some stormy Daniels woman 130,000 I mean which is gonna turn out to be perfectly legal that money was not campaign money sorry I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know it's not campaign money no campaign finance violation so they funneled it through the law firm some of those were all over him and the president repaid it oh I didn't know that he did yeah there's no campaign finance law zero and we're joined now by Michael avenatti and Michael I think you couldn't hear I don't know if you could hear there there's a pause and a shocked by John Sean Hannity when Sean Hannity says quite rightly I didn't know that after Rudy Giuliani says that the president reimbursed Michael Cohen well Lawrence thanks for having me on you know I have to tell you I am rarely as your viewers know rendered speechless but I am absolutely speechless at this revelation in this admission and I hope that your viewers and I hope the American people upon hearing this and watching that clip they should be outraged I don't care whether you're on the left or on the right or in the center I don't care what your party affiliation is you deserve to be told the truth by your president and the people that stand at the podium at the White House briefing station or podium at the White House briefing conference press conference and answer questions I don't care what your political persuasion is that's what you deserve as American citizen and this is an outrage what is going on here the American people have been lied to about disagreements about the hundred and thirty thousand dollars about the reimbursements and this is consistent with what we have been saying now for months that ultimately was going to be proven and alternately was going to come out we just didn't know that Rudy Giuliani was going to go on the Sean Hannity shells and admitted on national television but make no mistake about it justice needs to be served as a result of this and we are going to work morning noon and night to ensure that that is exactly what happens the President on Air Force One we have the video ready to go but I think people are familiar with it the President on Air Force One when the first time he ever spoke about this case said that he didn't know anything about it that Michael Cohen handled it and any questions about it they would have to ask Michael Cohen there's Rudy Giuliani tonight saying that that not only that that the president reimbursed Michael Cohen but he also issued a blanket statement saying that Donald Trump knew that Michael Cohen was always handling these kinds of things for Donald Trump yeah Lawrence lb not I'm familiar with the Air Force one statements you had me on the bite that they were made we now find out that they're completely false absolute lies about a very serious matter you know again I don't I don't know what to say I mean this is clear as day at this point what happened here this is no minor issue this is no situation where somebody will say or should say well this is no big deal the president United States and the people that are closest to him should not be lying to the American people about matters that are this significant they just shouldn't I want to know more and that's before we even get to the significant criminal aspects of this payment now there may be potential campaign finance violations felonies there may in fact the money laundering issues there may be bank fraud issues I mean this is a very very serious matter that deserves the attention of the American people regardless of your political suasion period Michael you've been saying before that there might be money laundering issues and there might be bank fraud issues and and there's been much speculation beyond you about possible bank fraud issues I want to go to a phrase that Rudy Rudy Giuliani used in speaking to Sean Hannity about the payment to stormy Daniels he said these are his words it was quote funneled through a law firm we have never heard that language from anyone on the president's side in this matter what what is your interpretation of Rudy Giuliani saying that the payment to stormy Daniels the hundred and thirty thousand dollars that the president reimbursed Michael Cohen for that's all information we got from Rudy Giuliani tonight that that payment was Rudy Giuliani's words funneled through a law firm well what that suggests to me Lawrence is is that a payment was made by Donald Trump or someone close to him directly to an intermediary law firm whether it be Michael Collins law firm or another law firm and then was we paid to a central consultants or Michael Cohen that could very well take on significant aspects of money laundering there could be serious charges that may result from that depending on how it was structured but it also shows if in fact it was done that way and again I don't want to get over the tips of our skis here because we don't know the details but if in fact Lawrence it was done that way then it shows a significant amount of thought into how to structure this in order to avoid detection and in order to avoid having this traced back directly to Donald Trump and that should tell people something very very significant Rudy Giuliani was also wrong on the law when he said there's no campaign finance violations possible because there was no campaign money used we already knew that there was no campaign money used as record of this expenditure occurring in campaign funds but the issue has always been did this function as a campaign contribution of 130 thousand dollars from Michael Cohen because it was a payment that did benefit the campaign because it helps Donald Trump survive a possible scandal in the campaign Rudy Giuliani doesn't seem to grasp that very obvious point of law in campaign finance law well I think Lawrence let me tell you what they're trying to line up it and you know again I see these guys coming a mile away here's the argument that they're gonna make and I don't think it's going to be successful but here it is they're gonna argue that ultimately this money was paid by Donald Trump individually and because it was paid by Donald Trump individually who has no limit as to the amount of money that he can put in to his own presidential campaign that somehow the reporting requirements or the limitations etc did not apply to him and therefore there was no campaign finance violation because of that fact that's the that's the foundation of the predicate Florence that they're attempting to lay at this point that does make perfect sense legally but then that goes up against what Donald Trump said on Air Force One and we have that video ready to go I think this is a good point to remind the audience because I think Michael the legal point you just made is an important one that they will claim because of the reimbursement this really was Donald Trump's money and there is no limit to how much the candidate can contribute to his own campaign let's again then listen to what Donald Trump said on Air Force One and Michael of course the famous answer was just that one word no when he was asked did you know that Michael Cohen made this payment so if he didn't know Michael Cohen made a payment to benefit his campaign they are in trouble on the campaign finance law well Lawrence I would agree with that and look we've seen a lot of conduct by the President and by mr. Trump when he was running for office and a lot of people laughed a lot of things off and to give him a pass on things I sincerely hope that we have not reached a place in this nation and and I don't think this can be overstated I really hope that we have not reached a place where it's okay for the President of the United States to stand aboard Air Force One on video and audio and lie to the American people I hope that we have not reached a place where that is accepted where did Giuliani said tonight that that is irrelevant that the everything about the stormy Daniels case is irrelevant he kept using the word irrelevant well if he thinks it's irrelevant he should wait around for the next few months and see how this plays out because I can assure you that it's going to be absolutely relevant and we will not sleep until it is clear to him and others that it is a hundred percent relevant Lawrence Michael we are still harvesting video from this interview and we have another piece of it that is about your case and when you hear it I too will be hearing it for the first time this is more from Rudy Giuliani about your case let's listen to this that was money that was paid by by his lawyer the way I would do out of his law firm funds or whatever funds doesn't matter my president reimbursed that over a period of seven it said didn't I I distinctly remember that he did it on his own he did without asking I don't know I haven't investigated that no reason to dispute that no reason is through the recollection I like Michael a lot you like Michael I feel very bad he's been victimized like this the president feels even worse the fact is just trust me they're gonna come up with no violations there all right be meaning the paper to perfect legal Mike 11 out of your reaction to that and this time Rudy Giuliani said that the president reimbursed Michael Cohen over a period of several months well Lawrence you know this is the plot thickens right so you know I certainly hope that what Giuliani Rudy Giuliani is not suggesting is is that in fact the reimbursement took place over several months in an effort to avoid triggering a ten thousand dollar monetary requirement relating the payments namely if they structured reimbursement payments and again I don't have any basis to believe that they did but that that statement causes me great concern if they structured reimbursements in amounts of less than $10,000 in an effort to potentially avoid detection that's a serious serious problem that's called structuring and it's a violation of federal law it's a criminal act in order to do that so again I don't know if that's what he's talking about but it doesn't make any sense as to why this reimburse that would take place across several months it just doesn't make any sense unless they were trying to avoid detection or there was some other reason that appears to be so or would appear to not have a reasonable legitimate legal basis hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
