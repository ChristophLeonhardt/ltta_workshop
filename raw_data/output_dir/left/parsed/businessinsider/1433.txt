with the details that they go did they
ever did I ever check the background of
this women they don't have any facts
she said that my husband took her to the
room and start kissing her she wrote in
the same story about me that she saw me
on Fifth Avenue and I said to her
Natasha how can I we don't see you
anymore I was never friend with her I
would not recognize her
that never happened never happened
that's why I send them the letter
because it discredited the story you see
your lawyer has sent a letter to people
magazines they have to retract yes
because was not true
you
