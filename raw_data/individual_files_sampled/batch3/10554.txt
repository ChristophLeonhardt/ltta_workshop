an expert investigating the Grenville tower fire in London has said that safety measures were inadequate and that the authorities advise to stay put failed the damning assessment comes as part of a public inquiry into the tragedy in which 72 people were killed last nope June with enough data on today's events at the hearing here's Nadira Tudor the purpose of the inquiries to obviously look at the circumstances surrounding the night of that tragedy to see if it could have been prevented and the emergency services were looked at as well as the cladding now if we look at the emergency services it says that there should have been 46 minutes between the first phone call to 999 and a response that didn't happen in fact they said that there was a total failure of the stay-put policy they also looked at the cladding and this was really interesting actually when they talked about certain materials that we used during refurbishment a material called polyethylene which is a highly combustible polymer was used and apparently it melts when exposed to fire and it acts as a fuel when it comes to fire mr. Madeleine Millett who was leading the inquiry said that this was the worst loss of domestic life by fire since World War two and we all know what happened that night following this tragic at night the government obviously promised who has all those who lost their homes but in fact what's happened in practice is only sixty two out of two hundred and nine have been housed since this has caused widespread protests across the country over the year and people have been demanding answers but this inquiry it's not a quick fix I have to warn you of that they gave a whole timeline as to how long it was going to take is going to be months they have a hundred and thirty five witness statements alone to look at so yes you know the public want answers but they are going to have to wait until they get all the answers and further action taken
