1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
This is Trout Mask Replica. On the album
cover is Captain Beefheart, a fish on his

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,880
face and a top hat on his head. The image
is surreal, it's grotesque, and it's the

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,199
perfect visual depiction of the music
you're about to hear.

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,620
My smile stuck. I cannot go back to your
frownland.

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,060
the 80 minutes of music on Trout Masks
Replica by Captain Beefheart and his

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,730
magic band have been compared to rusty
barbed wire, and the New York Times once

7
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,880
said that Captain Beefheart's voice
makes Tom Waits sound like Julie Andrews.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,610
But, here's the thing, 41 years after its
release in 1969 this cacophonous double

9
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,309
album was inducted into the Library of
Congress's National Recording registry

10
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:03,140
right alongside Al Green's classic "Let's
Stay Together" and the American standard

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,600
"Take Me out to the Ball Game". Not only
that, a number of iconic musicians, visual

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,280
artists, and creative thinkers have named
Trout Mask Replica a shining point of

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,170
inspiration for their work. How can an
album that sounds like the musical

14
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,840
equivalent of barbed wire be recognized
as such a significant piece of American

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
culture?

16
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,420
Let's start with Don Van Vliet known as
Captain Beefheart. He grew up in

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,110
California on the edge of the Mojave
Desert and by the age of 10 was an

18
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,670
incredible sculptor. Growing up he became
captivated by the blues perfected by

19
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,170
musicians like Muddy Waters and Howlin
wolf some 2,000 miles away in the

20
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,030
Mississippi Delta just as much he was
entranced by the free jazz of Ornette

21
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,189
Coleman and John Coltrane by the late
1960s he had an album and a small-time

22
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:02,200
hit a cover of Bo Diddley's "Diddy Wah
Diddy." For his next project he signed to

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,310
his former high school classmate, Frank
Zappa's, label with the clear request for

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,690
unbridled creative freedom to do
whatever the hell he wanted for his next

25
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,799
project. By 1969 Trout Mask Replica was
created and those years were a glorious

26
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:22,980
mess for everyone involved in its making.

27
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,860
This is Samuel Andreyev. He's a composer
who studied composition and music

28
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,850
analysis at the Paris Conservatory. A
number of things, first of all it's an

29
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,410
album that I'm personally obsessed with.
I think it's a phenomenal work of art.

30
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,150
it is mind-bendingly creative and
honestly pretty difficult to listen to,

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,820
but its uniqueness can be discovered
within its songs, especially Frownland.

32
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,900
Well the purpose of Frownland as an
album opener is to just plunge you

33
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:10,590
headfirst into a maelstrom of just
absolute strangeness.

34
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,760
Here's something interesting you can do
as an experiment: compare it to a piece

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:37,140
like "You really got me" by the Kinks. Okay
so the main guitar riff in that song da

36
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,750
da da dum da da da da that's two notes
okay and that's what the song is built

37
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,100
out of. The most important thing is at
the rhythm guitar, lead guitar, bass, drums,

38
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,230
and vocals are all locked into one
rhythm - they are playing in sync. So

39
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,570
contrast that with "Frownland" where in
minute 40 seconds you have no fewer than

40
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,720
I think like 23 individual motifs - it's
actually 21 but that's still a whole lot -

41
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,910
and these 23 motifs are all individually
rather complex. Added to that is the fact

42
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,360
that they're all heard stacked on top of
each other all the time. Not only that

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,168
the traditional roles of rock
instrumentation found in songs like you

44
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,279
really got me we'e just completely
thrown out the window. Just listen

45
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,620
closely to the first five seconds of the
track.

46
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,880
You'll immediately notice that the
rhythm is off-kilter. That's because the

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,690
rhythm guitar and the lead guitar are
playing a five over seven polyrhythm.

48
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,440
That means one guitar is playing five
beats per measure at the same time the

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,700
other is playing seven. Okay so try
clapping five beats in one hand and the

50
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:58,260
same time you clap seven. Not
only is a piece polyrhythmic, it's also

51
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,520
polytonal. Both guitars are playing in
different keys throughout the piece

52
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,290
against each other and often they're
changing keys. Typically the bass would

53
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,820
ground the harmony and the rhythm but
here it's treated like a third guitar so

54
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,280
it lives in its own world as well. And,
it's playing chords which just rarely

55
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,320
happens in rock music. And on top of that
you have these insanely virtuosic drums

56
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,350
that have another function altogether.
The drummer is trying to take elements

57
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,180
of what the guitar is doing and what the
bass is doing and basically glue them

58
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,130
together so that the piece coheres. In
the end you have a really condensed song

59
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,330
with multiple instruments constantly
changing keys tempos and time signatures

60
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:49,050
and across the entire album this happens.
Trout Mask Replica is a masterpiece

61
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,210
because it does something that is almost
impossible hard to do, it comes from a

62
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,190
very rare place of art making. So art
scholars talk about the sentimental

63
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,990
versus the naive. On one end of the
spectrum you have sentimental art - art

64
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,070
that comes from a place of a lot of
formal training. At the other end you

65
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,230
have naive art - art that is almost
childlike. It exists purely because the

66
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,530
compulsion to make it was so strong. The
great thing about Trout Mask Replica is

67
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:26,100
that they literally splice together
naive impulses into a structure. So it

68
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,180
sounds totally improvised it sounds like
they're making it up on the spot but

69
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,300
they rehearsed these pieces, that's
really hard. So how do you teach these

70
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:50,120
musicians
to play your music? A kind whip. A kinda quip. A kind well

71
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,020
hell you know tape with the piano. A
tape. Captain Beefheart was the singular

72
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,890
creative force behind Trout Mask Replica
and he composed every song on the piano

73
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,000
without knowing how to play it.
He pretty much didn't play any

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,890
instrument, but he had his magic band
which consisted of remarkable young

75
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,390
musicians like Zoot Horn Rollo, Drumbo,
Antennae Jimmy Semmens, and Rockette Mornton.

76
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,190
Their job? translate Captain
Beefheart's avant-garde approach into a

77
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,770
blues and free jazz inspired rock album
based on the music he created on an

78
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:31,030
instrument he really didn't know how to
play. Let that sink in for a second. A

79
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,020
piano has 88 keys and with two hands you
can easily play the lowest and the

80
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,840
highest keys at the same time if you
wanted to.

81
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,140
Don Van Vliet expected those same sounds
from his two guitarist and a bassist

82
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,070
who's instrument ranges were just vastly
different. Here's Bill Harkleroad, you

83
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,490
might remember him as Zoot Horn Rollo. Oh
I think it was just that there were

84
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,880
parts and then well why can't you play
those notes what's wrong with you? Why

85
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,970
can't you play that note that's not
on the guitar or seven notes at a time?

86
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,470
So there was no choice but to do it. He used
to say you think you got a hard job man

87
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,570
I got a sing to that shit. And that is
John French, the drummer. He had the

88
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,680
arduous task of helping other members of
the band learn everything that came out

89
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,210
Don's piano. Sometimes I wondered I
wondered if he knew that it was in a

90
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,370
different time signature you know, but he
didn't know what time signature was.

91
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,479
They painstakingly rehearsed over the
course of a year until they were able to

92
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:34,650
record the entire double album all the
way through in just a few hours.

93
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,800
When I first came across Trout Mask Replica, I was instantly captivated by

94
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,620
the sound of those three words strung
together. Every song title made me laugh

95
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,960
and so I listened to it and it instantly
expanded my understanding of what music

96
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,870
could be. For some people it can be
offensive it sounds like they're

97
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,730
deliberately flaunting the rules I don't
think I don't view it that way I don't

98
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,030
think anyone's deliberately flaunting
the rules I think I don't think it's

99
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,630
contrarian for the sake of being
contrarian I think rather what it is is

100
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,750
its artistic for the sake of being
original. Hey all thanks for watching

101
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,800
first I want to give a huge shout out to
Samuel andreyev he was sort of the

102
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,810
inspiration for this video
he made a 30-minute video about the

103
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,770
music theory of frownland that's
linked below you should really really

104
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,120
check it out if you want to know more
about that specific song in addition

105
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,780
he's the one that conducted the two
interviews with John French and Bill

106
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,000
Harkleroad they're also on his YouTube
channel thanks so much for watching and

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you in a couple of weeks
