joining us live from Gainesville Florida former FEMA administrator under President Obama Craig Fugate before that he served as Florida's director of Emergency Management so Craig certainly has a deep understanding of storms and storms in this region Craig let's start with 155 mile an hour winds what does that mean to structures in the area how serious is that for buildings well unfortunately this is a very rural low-income area in many places where we have a lot of manufactured housing and a lot of older mobile homes that aren't even built to current codes so we would expect a lot of structural damage but also all the trees coming down and with us 98 being the primary highway it's right on the coast and that got wiped out in hurricane Dennis in 2005 I imagine there's going to be very little of us 98 that's going to survive this storm Craig you have been involved in Katrina and Wilma and Dennis in Ivan and again and with you and I talked a lot during Florence you know what what are what are you most worried about here are you most worried about this remarkably destructive high velocity 155 mile per hour winds in some places where as you said we keep talking to people those houses were built in the 1920s in the 1940s and are not built to current code or are you worried about the water damage that we're gonna see both this is a this is a total hurricane the storm surge values here are the highest of anywhere in the state of Florida those low-lying areas have yet to see the bulk of the storm surge come in and then the winds and actually the older homes have historically done better it was the newer construction starting in the mid 60's through the 80s and early 90s that we really saw homes that weren't being built for the Hurricanes we faced governor Bush signed into law the statewide unified Building Code and we started moving in the right direction of making sure our codes reflected our risk the newer homes do better some of the older homes do better but a lot of people live in those homes in between and they're gonna have a lot of damage okay I just interrupted meteorologist bill guys I'm gonna interrupt you for one second as while you're talking our viewers are watching one of our crews in Panama City what appears to be trying to hold the window in place some believe that Kru can hear us and they have anything get the match get the mattress off the bed and put that against the window what they're doing is extremely dangerous if that window shatters right in front of their faces like that when they're trying to hold that so I don't know if they can hear me or not well we'll get our control room as well if we can to get that message through the hospital if we're still in contact right because because part of the issue is not just the force of the wind and whether the glass can hold up against it but it's things that are gonna blow and if the wind blow a sign that nice of wood is on yeah is in their faces so a small projectile going into a glass like that can break it if it's not hurricane glass I mean Craig one of the things that we've seen since the Katrina days particularly on the Gulf Coast have been remarkable improvements in building in glass in the way roofs are attached in in the the rise that some houses are built on off of off of sea level but as you said a lot of the areas that are getting hit right now are poorer areas or lower income areas where if your house wasn't destroyed you had no reason to rebuild it right the other thing is trees are going to be coming down and none of the codes were prepared for oak trees and pine trees slicing through your roof yep so this is still a very dangerous situation even with the better codes it never meant we wouldn't have damages they just meant we were going to have less damages and you could probably repair your home versus losing everything so right now the focus on life safety and treating this like a big tornado getting low staying low staying away from windows outside exposures and this is going to be over hours not minutes like we generally see with isolated tornadoes this area is used to hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
