1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The day before inauguration,
I was at the White House.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,350
We're doing hair and make up, and
the first lady, she looked at me and said,

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,410
“Hervé, do you know that tomorrow your
name will be all over the news?”

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:18,375
I didn't realize the scale until
suddenly my phone was going ballistic.

5
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,410
Before, I was under the radar.

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,750
Nobody really knew who I was
except the people in fashion.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,655
Not under my name, but I dressed
all the other first ladies.

8
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:49,660
My mother, the
other day, she said,

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,150
“I cannot find a picture
of you in a bad mood.”

10
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm always like — I'm
always happy, I guess.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,265
When I came to New York, I
worked for Oscar de la Renta.

12
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:06,020
It was fascinating for me to already
work on an inauguration dress.

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,740
Afterwards, when I was
at Carolina Herrera,

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,020
I worked with Mrs. Bush a lot.

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,140
And then, there was a state
dinner for Mrs. Obama.

16
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,880
But now I am on my own.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
It's a new beginning for me.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,360
When you're on your own, I go for
like different kind of customers.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,330
That's what I really,
really, really enjoy.

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,590
I love the stork.
I don't know why.

21
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,180
What changed a little bit in
January is when I designed

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,461
the dress for the first lady
for the inauguration ball.

23
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,770
I never, never, never,
never met her before.

24
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,727
And it was 10 days
before inauguration.

25
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:53,100
I received a phone call at
8 o'clock in the morning, in my PJs.

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,980
And I had to deliver sketches
at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,820
And I was not prepared for that.

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,410
It was around noon.
And I touched this for good luck.

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,231
And I said, please, please,
I was begging for the muse to come.

30
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,260
And eventually, they came.

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,060
Because I remember I gave —

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,450
I believe it was six options.

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,180
When she saw the sketches, 
she said,

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,120
“Well, what is appealing 
with you is like,

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,750
I will be able to have
something specifically made

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,277
for a specific occasion.
Would you like to do that?”

37
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:23,240
And I said, “Absolutely.”

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,940
For me, it was a big honor
to dress the first lady,

39
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,400
this time under my name.

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,900
Well, about the controversy
of this White House,

41
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,520
I don't have so much to say.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,125
I'm here to speak about fashion.

43
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,770
The thing that I would say, is that's
the beauty of New York and this country.

44
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,790
It's a democracy.

45
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,060
So some people want to
work with certain people.

46
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,070
Some people don't want to.

47
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,130
I choose to —

48
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,920
I choose to do it.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,510
If you forget about
political whatever —

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,240
the very specific needs
are so interesting.

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,525
When you have a customer who
is telling you, who said,

52
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:11,770
“OK. I have a visit — a state visit
next week with the queen of Jordan.”

53
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,020
Or to see a pope.

54
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,180
I mean, who — for a designer
to create a dress to go to see

55
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,050
the pope, it doesn't
happen to you every day.

56
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,040
It's a very unusual request
for a very specific customer.

57
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,830
You see? That's nice.

58
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,720
Oh, yes. Yes. That's very good.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,690
We do have a mannequin
for the first lady. Of course.

60
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,833
But I won't show it to you.

61
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,916
[Laughs]

62
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,960
That's really like
the naked body, you know?

63
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,510
There is no —

64
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,490
I'm still naive about it.

65
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,630
The scale of a decision that
is made between two people is

66
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,220
going to spread like ink —
it's like huge.

67
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,140
Even if I'm not
creating the clothes,

68
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,540
what is creating is to see
what kind of message and how

69
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,630
it's going to be perceived.

70
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,520
Suddenly, this picture is
forever in the newspapers,

71
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,730
in history.

72
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,900
You really have to answer the
wardrobe of a woman who is

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,050
going to be photographed
all over the world.

74
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,829
You walk on eggs.

75
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,339
God knows you walk on eggs
because you never know.

76
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,630
When you're 6 years old,
you think that you just need

77
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,454
to sing and snap your finger,

78
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:27,870
and the dress is
going to be made.

79
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,060
You will learn the hard way a
little bit later that it's not so easy.

80
00:04:32,060 --> 00:00:00,000
But I took the challenge.
