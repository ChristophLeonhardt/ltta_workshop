so here's something you won't hear anywhere else but here today okay a lot of times you hear these arguments between people who believe in the book of Genesis and people who believe in evolution and I believe in both and it just it really occurred to me yesterday as I was thinking about it that in some bizarre way they almost a supernatural way they said almost exactly the same thing about the development of human consciousness and self consciousness and what it means for the divisions between the sexes I want to talk about that and I want to talk about the effect that's going to have on the 2018 midterms where else you hear that warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show and this week shocked by I cannot believe it it's already Thursday I think it's because I've been running around so much doing I have that piece in City Journal and went viral about Trump's you know crude remark as it were about hey Haiti and I've been being interviewed everywhere so I just feel like I've been doing nothing but talking all week and it's just the day slip I'm supposed to be on Fox and Friends tomorrow morning if you want to hear that but now now the claim that even the clave this weekend will not be the Clavin this weekend because the another Kingdom season finale is going up tomorrow Friday that's right tomorrow Friday if you haven't listened to this you can now binge the entire 13 episodes the entire first season please help us out I'm gonna be pitching it next week I think to another producer so please you know and every time you go on there and give it good ratings and give it good reviews and just the numbers really help so another Kingdom any where you get a podcast and the exciting season finale will be there we have James O'Keefe of Project Veritas he has a new book called American problem I fight for truth in the era of fake news and he is going to come on and talk to us about that and meanwhile meanwhile you may notice that if there is one thing I know about it is shaving and that is why long before they ever became a sponsor I belong to the Dollar Shave Club because I have so much real estate to shake I mean it's like mowing the lawn for me it's like some people who guys it's for me it's like a 20 minute thing Dollar Shave Club makes products for your hair your face skin shower everything you need and what I what I love about them is you can change it as you go on you think well I would like some of their dr.

dollarshaveclub.com slash Clavin I've been using it for years it really is terrific it takes all the worry out of it and the other thing is now they put their razors in the drugstore they put them in the alarmed cases I guess they get shoplifted a lot so you don't have to do that so let's begin we're gonna be talking about the Democrats are relying on women to be fools they are relying on women to be stupid and emotional and over emotional and and for them to win back the house especially everything they're doing is about winning back the house every single move they make that's all it's about and they are playing specifically women they are depending on them on a sense of grievance on a sense of victimhood on a sense of a way in which an emotional atmosphere affects women instead of they are the Democrats are relying on an emotional atmosphere to affect women instead of the facts and you know Donald Trump yesterday I was I was so jealous he had that he did this thing where he finally released the fake news Awards and I was lobbying to be the host I wanted to be the host of the fakeness I was I was willing to buy a tuxedo from Knowles to just to do this show I just thought like we should we should really do it laugh that you know in memoriam of Keith Olbermann you know all the fake news but the funny thing about the fake news is that he put them up on the RNC website I guess and it crashed and so CBS reported they published fake news and then the site stops working which was fake news because it crashed because so many people rushed on to see it but what really got me about the fake news Awards and this is important as part of what I'm saying is that they were actually very substantial I mean there were a few of them that were a little bit yeah what would you call a trivial but a lot of them were really substantial so here I'll just read him off number one the New York Times Paul Krugman claimed on the day of president Trump's historic landslide victory that the economy would never recover he didn't say that now I don't think Krugman should get a lot for that because that's kind of typecast for him he does that all the time every prediction he's ever made about the economy has turned out to be wrong number two ABC News's Brian Ross sends markets into a downward spiral when he reported that candidate Trump ordered Michael Flynn to meet with the Russians when in fact so here we have a little bit of video of the correction I think let's let's play that ABC's lead investigative reporter Brian Ross appeared to be the one with the scoop he's prepared to testify the president Trump as a candidate Donald Trump ordered him directed him to make contact with the Russians that would directly tie the President to the Russia scandal now that report calls the Dow Jones to take a nosedive dropping 350 points at one point except Ross miss quoted his source and it took ABC News hours to correct the mistake in fact it was president-elect Trump who asked him to contact the Russians which of course is pretty much standard operating procedure but again this is Brian Ross beating Brian Ross Gawker once called him America's longest reporter he's the guy who said that after the shooting in the Aurora Colorado movie theater that the shooter may have had tea party ties because he found another guy with the same name James Holmes who belonged to the Tea Party so I mean he's a really bad about stuff like this number three CNN falsely reported that candidate Donald Trump and his son Donald J Trump jr. had access to hacked documents from WikiLeaks do we have this I think we have a clip of this now we've been reporting that this email came on September 4th that was before some of these documents were publicly available but we have just received obtained a copy of this email and instead we now learned that this this email was on September 14th so that is 10 days later than what we originally reported earlier today and and this is appears to change the understanding of this yeah I changed the understanding because the WikiLeaks had already been published so somebody was sending him a letter said have you seen this but that one it's just a one CNN locate don't feel too bad about it let's see what else we got Oh time falsely reported that President Trump removed a bust of Martin Luther King jr. from the Oval Office that was particularly vicious and I love the fact well it's just a mistake just a mistake I mean that was a vicious vicious mistake their bait is that's basically the press reporting on it from its own imagination you know this is this is Brian Ross reporting from my imagination The Washington Post number five falsely reported the president massive sold-out rally in Pensacola Florida was empty they showed pictures of the empty arena hours before the crowd started pouring in these are a little trivial CNN falsely edited a video to make it appear president Trump defiantly overfed fish during a visit with a Japanese Prime Minister and you know you say they're trivial but the point of this is that they're never in favor of Trump they never make a trivial mistake in favor of Donald Trump and that's the point that's how you know they're targeting Donald Trump CNN falsely reported about Anthony scaramouche she's meeting with a Russian but retracted it due to a significant breakdown oh this is where they've fired three journal they suspended three CNN journalists because they said they hadn't followed their usual fact-checking procedures so I think they should deserve a special award for playing the role of a network that actually checks its facts that would a big big change for CNN Newsweek falsely reported that Polish first lady would not shake president Trump's hand that was false CNN falsely reported the former FBI director James Comey would dispute president Trump's claim that he was told he is not under investigation now that was a big big ugly stupid mistake the New York Times falsely claimed on the front page the Trump administration had hidden a climate report taking it off their page and last but not least is the Russia collusion because now I mean it really does seem now and look this is we don't have the solidly but it seems extremely possible that this entire Russian collusion story is Democrat Oppo research used by the FBI to cover up the fact that the president that President Obama had corrupted the top levels of the Justice Department not the rank and file most FBI agents are doing their job catching bad guys it's these guys who got political and the the administration the chicago-style Obama administration and this whole Russian collusion thing may be a cover-up for that we don't have that solidly but it's very very plausible that it's like that and that the only reason the Trump hasn't blown the whole thing open by releasing the Pfizer request as they probably have some information in there that would reflect negatively on him too as well so he's holding it up but that is a very very plausible version and they're just not reporting it only Fox News is reporting that aspect of the story so here's the other thing part of this is while the media spent 90% of the time focused on negative coverage or fake news the president has been doing things that they're not reporting so much and this is still part of the president's release the economy has created nearly 2 million jobs and gained over 8 trillion in wealth since the president's inauguration african-americans and Hispanics are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in recorded history the President signed historic tax cuts and relief for hardworking Americans President Trump's plan to cut regulations has exceeded 2 out of everyone in mandate issuing 22d regulatory actions for everyone new regulatory action that to me is one of the biggest stories of the Trump administration the president has unleashed an American energy boom that has true Isis's and retreat having been crushed in Iraq and Syria and you will remember that Obama said Isis is a generational threat meaning there's nothing we can do there's nothing we can do Trump bang they're gone I mean come on it's a big big deal virtually uncovered president Trump followed through on his promise to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel something every president has said they would do Trump did it with president Trump's encouragement more member nations are paying their fair share at NATO he signed this is a big one too he signed the veterans accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act to allow senior officials in the VA to fire failing employees and establishes safeguards to protect whistleblowers President Trump kept his promise and appointed Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch to the US Supreme Court and that's just the headline because they've been like 60 great judges appointed all this stuff the point of all this stuff is to create this atmosphere of Trump scandal Trump outrage Trump terror and who does it affect well here we go dan Henninger at the Wall Street Journal wrote a really good column today called the Trump paradox and the Trump paradox that Donald Trump may be the most disliked president in the post-war era even as he presides over one of the most solid first year policy performances of that era most notably a strengthening economy from most of the first year henagar says the Trump paradox paradox didn't matter much beyond the altered psychological state of his audience reacting to Trump became like uncontrollable whether a daily routine but in year two the storyline is about to change why everything in 2018 will be identified in terms of its effect on the November midterm elections and that is why dick Durbin is going around telling people what Trump said in the meeting when he made that remark about hellholes now I have my I have a new thing under my desk where I can press and and silence myself mute myself so from now I can say it's like I whole countries you know did it work I hope so otherwise we're off the air but that is why dick Durbin did this henagar says dick Durbin poisoned the well of the immigration negotiations because he recognized he's a political animal and he recognized that Democrats would gain more politically from public exposure of mr. Trump's private words than they would from any doc a deal so basically Durbin and the Democrats are throwing Dhaka the Dhaka people under the bus in order to make people hate Trump right the Democrat resistance and this is henagar again the Democratic resistance which looked pathetic and irresponsible in the year one suddenly makes sense in year two the generic ballot numbers which show the public preferring a Democratic Congress by an astounding 11 point average are suddenly relevant suddenly and matters that mr. Trump's approval in Georgia which he carried in 2016 with 51% is now 38% and here's the thing all right here's the kicker though this one-man meltdown is occurring almost entirely among women driven by a relentlessly smirking I could care less demeanor the beer and shot base loves it women they just don't like it women came out of the woodwork to vote against Trump in the Virginia gubernatorial election that Ed Gillespie lost and the fact is as we talked about yesterday Trump has appointed really powerful women to very powerful post nikki Haley you know Kirsten Nielsen at Homeland Security Sarah Sanders is doing a great job he was talking about that he gave a speech and he actually was mentioning as he does when he gives himself praise his accomplishments in this regard making incredible progress the women's unemployment rate hit the lowest level that it's been in seventeen years well at something and women in the workforce reached a record high more women in the workforce today than ever before that's really terrific and especially since it's on my watch I feel very proud of that okay so the difference between the facts and an atmosphere an emotional atmosphere of murkiness scandal but part of which Trump is responsible for part of which Trump does he's a rude guy he's a belligerent guy he says what he thinks and he you know he he has this bullying attitude that just forget it goes up wins back I can see it I can see it it's hard you cannot sit and explain to your wife that her life is better because she's sitting there saying but he does this and he looks like this and he says this you know that it's really tough to do now let's I'm gonna pause here for just a minute to talk about our we welcome our new sponsor which is da Vinci this is a spectacular service Shapiro uses this all the time and he loves it I you know today after work I have a meeting with some producers what do I do you know they don't producers are fly-by-night people

calm / Clavin and it's a really good way to do business either on the road or at home if you work for yourself alright so here's the thing in the New York Times a former newspaper they today they were saying there was a column that said maybe the me2 movement is going to help Donald Trump many think the issue of sexual harassment embodied in the me2 movement will work to the advantage of Democrats in upcoming elections a mid-december NBC News Wall Street Journal survey gave the party a three-to-one advantage over Republicans on the matter but is hardly guaranteed to do so the whole idea of this is this whole me too thing this whole rape culture thing this you know it's very much I don't have time today to talk about cultural Marxism but it's very much a part and product of cultural Marxism and it's been part of the feminist movement forever the idea that if you are a woman you are a victim class that is basically it that is the entire thing and it is a political movement to get women to feel hard done by which which women basically you know that there is an element of that in the female personality 1972 Joan Didion do you know who Joan today Joan Didion is really fine writer she wrote a really good novel called play it as it lays and she wrote all these essays if you ever reach slouching toward Bethlehem a great book of essay so now we're talking 1972 the very beginning of the feminist movement she talks about the fact that they've run out of proletariat to help through their socialism so they've now turned to women they said just as she says at the exact a spirited moment when there seemed no one at all willing to play the proletariat right the working man who was supposed to unite under socialism along came the women's movement and the invention of women as a class one could not help admiring the radical simplicity of this instant Transfiguration this is the Democrat playbook find a victim get him to put you know play him off everybody else and make him feel that they are hard but done by so she says the feminist is Joan Didion she says the feminists tated up the pans scoured the towels picked off the bathroom floor the loads of laundry done in a lifetime cooking a meal could only be dog work and to claim any pleasure from it was evidence of Craven acquiescence in one's own forced labor small children could only be odious mechanisms for the spilling and digesting of food for robbing women of their freedom it was a long way from Simone de Beauvoir's grave an awesome recognition of woman's role as the other to the notion that the first step in changing that role was a marriage contract like the wife strips the bed but the husband remakes them and this was part of cultural Marxism and Marxism you know there was a movement when the when the Frankfurt School came over from Germany escaping the Nazis and they took over they started the long march through our universities they said we have got to destroy the family because the family is a place where traditional Authority and traditional means of you know of getting along and relating to each other is there so they promoted homosexuality they promoted perverse sexuality that kind of combined Marx and Freud we'll get into that another day but let's talk I want to talk for a minute about the Bible and evolution and what this has to do with what I'm talking about as you know in the Bible there in Adam and even in paradise Adam is so thrilled to have a woman with him God created man mankind in His image male and female both male and female are created in the image of God but they ate the apple the tree their fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and they essentially became the human beings that we are with a with a knowledge of good and evil a kind of self-consciousness and God punished them by said here's what he said and it's amazing how much of what God's punishment involves the relationship between men and women that the fall affects the relationship between men and women he says I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing he says to Eve in pain you shall bring forth children your desire shall be contrary to your husband but he shall rule over you you'll want to do other things but he shall rule over you because and then he says to Adam because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you you shall not eat cursed is the ground because of you in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you and you eat the plants of the field in other words he says by the sweat of your face you shall eat bread you're gonna have to work to get your bread it's not gonna be paradise where the food is given to you to you till you return to the ground for out of it you were taken your dust and to dust you shall return and now a lot of people say you know like oh well this all happened in seven days and we have to believe every word of this is literal and I always say no this is conveying something this is a myth that conveys something essentially true and one of the things that conveys is that the superior brains of human beings cause a lot of the problems a lot of the separation between men and women the fact that human beings became not just sentient but self-conscious with these enormous heads and walking upright though walking upright caused us we needed narrower hips to walk upright and we needed bigger brains to become self conscious people with consciences who could basically live in the image of God through the knowledge of good and evil and that of course causes tremendous pain in childbirth right that's one of the reasons women suffer so much pain in child but it also means that people have to come out of the womb earlier so if you ever see a horse being born right the horse is born gets up it's a second is it really a second it starts to run around babies are helpless for years years because if their brains if their heads got any bigger the woman would explode like in something like in the Alien movies so that in other words the child has to be born helpless the mother needs to be there for a very long time and that means that means that she is taken out of the power structures of the world and she is dependent on her husband it also means that the husband in order to maintain the family and maintain his own children has to sweat has to work to make bread it is the knowledge of it is the knowledge the superior knowledge the godlike consciousness of human beings that causes this division of labour to be so intense in human beings the the story is supernatural I mean only only inspired writers could have gotten so close to what it would be the scientific truth thousands of years later I mean it really is almost an exact representation so here is the difference I was talking that was on Dennis Prager show yesterday we're talking about the fact that conservatives are happier than leftist I mean it's obvious leftists are always complaining they're always miserable there are always victims and I said to Dennis one of the things about you and I Dennis because Dennis and I have very similar approaches to life different and very important ways been very similar in important ways I said we wake up every day with the knowledge that life is tragic and sad and that makes us happy because you realize every day that goes well is a gift every day of life is a gift even this melancholy that you sometimes feel the sorrow you feel for the world is a gift what the left is selling you is a is that they can fix your grievances that they can fix this fallen state of man and what the right is selling you and is always harder to sell is know this is the state of man until Jesus comes again this is the state of man that in which we are to take our joy we are to take our joy from our femininity from our masculinity from our different roles from the way that it from the life that it creates for us and yes is there unfairness baked into it yep yeah yes it is it's a fallen world it's a sad world but because we wake up with that knowledge we are far far happier the the left is depending on women to feel victimized it is depending on you to feel victimized by the very state of being women by the very state one of the things that Joan Didion goes on to say is that feminism is basically against adulthood it is against the fact that masculine sex drives are rough that men are rougher than women it promotes lesbianism because it's so gentle so that their love is so gentle it's like they're against being grownups and I think that what the left is depending on is to women to be grownups and that's how they plan to win the midterms we will see if it succeeds we have you know what listen can we stay on the air we'll keep James O'Keefe we want to hear from James O'Keefe so we're gonna stay with you but please subscribe to the daily wired.com it's a lousy ten bucks a month you get to ask your questions in the mailbag for a lousy hundred bucks a month you get a year-long subscription and the leftist tears tumblr but we won't cut you off from Facebook and YouTube because we want you to see James O'Keefe he is an important player right now with all this fake news that is going on he has written a new book which I've dipped into I haven't had a chance to actually read it but I've been dipping into it's really well-written very thoughtful it's called American Pravda my fight for truth in the era of fake news James O'Keefe is he there have we got him there he is hey how you doing James it's good to see you good good to see you great to be with you you know this book is a I don't know if who did the writing if you actually sat down alright it sounds just like you it is incredibly eloquent and thoughtful and surprisingly rich you know a lot of books that come out are just self promotional tools this is one is not it is a real read and I'm really I will finish it and it's really interesting so I want to talk to you about this you start out very early on saying that things have gotten worse that we can expect a disparity between the media and reality of course anybody who's talking about reality but since the computer age essentially things have gotten much worse why why do you think that is well Andrew first of all thank you for having me on and thank you for always having our back at Project Veritas we love you guys and I did write it I locked myself in a log cabin for a week I wrote it I I did a lot of research I read a lot of the progressive muckrakers from the early 20th century upton sinclair pam zeckman a lot of the invested in Mike Wallace a lot of the investigative reporters in guntur wall roof who actually did this and they and and if you think what we do at Project Veritas is is hardcore or crosses an ethical line then you need to study history because this is not like we're doing something new Under the Sun you know George Orwell wrote in 1984 that the party the opposition the establishment the deep state if you will would demand that you don't believe the evidence of your eyes and ears they would that was the most important commandment yeah the protagonist Winston Smith said in 1984 the party demanded that I don't trust my own instincts my own sensory perceptions of the world around me so Veritas is just simply using modern technology to disseminate truth to the people and the propagandists do not want you to trust your own eyes and ears there is a great anecdote this after the Michael Wolf thing with the with the quotes in the White House and the Washington Post reported quote there's no evidence to suggest that he did not say the things discussed I mean I mean that logic is so twisted and it's not Andrew it's not necessarily something that the journal community will say explicitly we're propagandists but it's a group think that his fostered inside the New York Times so Veritas smashes the status narratives with reality with cinema verite and were hated for it so this book talks about that and about the moral courage required to do it why did it has gotten so bad why leaving believing Trump aside right now because Trump has upped the ante by fighting back but at the same time they were calling Bush Hitler they were calling Mitt Romney one of the nicest people who ever ever president he was a dog killer and he killed some woman you know I mean they have really been out of control for quite a long time why is it so bad that is what this book really dives into it goes into some history some philosophy and some modern media treatise on modern media a couple reasons first of all I mean it started with Ben Bradley with Kennedy I mean they were they were lap dogs they were sharing pieces with JFK before it went to print and then Watergate happened and journalists stopped pursuing truth for facts sake and started pursuing power they wanted to become powerful they have a Woodward and Bernstein hero complex they're still talking about Richard Nixon and something happened in the 80s and 90s with the consolidation of media media became there's like six companies that control all the information not to sound like Noam Chomsky but there's some there's some truth in that that that media don't want to challenge the sort of prevailing orthodoxy the narratives and then you have journalists who got so cozy with their sources that they're unable to burn their sources so when I investigated to where we investigated Twitter this past week it was a big story I mean it was it was a big story twitter twitter is one of the most powerful companies in the United States along with Google and Facebook and but but that sort of TechCrunch a BuzzFeed these communities were afraid to make a phone call to to Twitter to ask because they didn't want to burn their friends so you have this sort of system supported propaganda mechanism that's just getting bigger and bigger and and whenever anybody actually challenges it you are systematically destroyed targeted called a racist I could talk for an hour about this but they you know when I first got started in my career I went into acorn and I exposed my friend and I posed the pimp and prostitute an acorn shut down Congress defunded ACORN journalists eat your heart out that was a result that most people won't achieve in their lifetime and the Washington Post did a front-page story and they said O'Keefe's motivated by this because he doesn't like black people and I never said that and you know what Andrew the Washington Post had to print a retraction that was a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter Carol Lennon printed a retraction and - nobody knows about that so it's just I think it's just a moral courage that's required to fight this fight and and and I want to talk a little about you know if I can with you about about what that's about because I think well there's a lot of things let me ask you this and we're talking of course to James O'Keefe the guerrilla journalist of Project Veritas his book is American Pravda my fight for truth in the era of fake news you know I've always I believe I've said this to you privately you have to be a little bit insane to do what you do I mean I it is a Matt it is kind of mad thing to walk into these places and it does III agree with you it does require courage let me ask you this though is there is there a drawback that you will be always playing gotcha and never getting in depth stories I this is the one thing that concerns me that our guys are always you know you are a guerrilla journalist you are doing something that needs to be done because you are up against a monolithic corporate media there's just no question about it and you have made tremendous strides doing that but is there a danger that you'll you'll always be in a position of just saying oh I got you to say something you know damning instead of getting rich deep stories like the New York Times was capable of doing when they try well unfortunately it's gotten so bad in our country that if they're if they were doing their jobs there wouldn't be a need for people like me but there is sort of a sacred I think Matt Drudge said something like that in 19 1998 when it's a cough spike the Lewinsky story with great power comes great responsibility and whether or not you can use this sort of undercover technique you know and you using an alias to draw people out to get their private thoughts Andrew I would argue that when people tell you things on the record and they know that you're gonna report that it's almost like the reporter is relaying a lie to them to the public because most politicians are never going to most politicians when they know they're on the record are not going to tell you the honest truth so people say whoa Keef your deceptive use deception to gain access to I would argue that I would argue that the people who use deception are reporters who relay information on the record because it's far more important to tell the truth to your audience than it is to tell the truth to your target or your subject we deceive our subjects to draw the truth out of them to tell the truth your audience well is that ethical well you can't really evaluate the ethics of the of the of the means without evaluating the utility of the ends and and some of these stories we do are so important the story we just did on Twitter where they're literally rewiring human democracy by not allowing your tweets to show up on your friends timelines if they don't like you I can't imagine a story more vital to the public interest in that and the most important thing for journalists to do is to tell the truth to the people and if you look at history Upton Sinclair and you know again all these people I've been reading and I'm like oh my it's like I'm reading a you know I I'm they went through hell Upton Sinclair was attacked by the media for a year because he was challenging them and they were jealous of him and he was an independent so it's just like all a little bit of history repeating Andrew were telling don't tell me some of the things I mean we've talked about this privately so tell me some of the things that they have done to you to try and shut you down and again I don't want your audience to think I'm self and grand icing here that I'm that I'm that I'm hearing it's pretty amazing they've gone to some pretty spectacular lights it's amazing what we what we my team it's not it's not just me have been through we have been I was on probation for three years I went to jail I I said inside of a senator's office I opened the door it was broad daylight I didn't break into it I just walked in and I sat down and I said I said what are you here for a certain I said well I'm waiting for someone when I wasn't actually waiting for the person I had in mind so they prosecuted me under misdemeanor I spent three years confined to my home in New Jersey and had to do hard labor um I've been I've been sued 20 times I've been indicted I've actually been had criminal grand juries subpoenas issued to me in New Hampshire twice currently I'm being sued for a million dollars I appear in federal court next week for exposing the Hillary Clinton campaign people I have the New York Attorney General threatening my taxes em status the California Attorney General sending me a correspondence audit letter and I have every sigh got five billion that's Bravo five billion negative media impressions in the month of December for our one of our undercover reporters got burned at The Washington Post and you face all this flak and all this hatred I mean they they hate us I mean it's yeah it's visceral and and and and I believe in you know I tell I told my I got fifty people on my team now and I told my team that you know that we're like the Death Star the more they shoot at us the bigger that we get and as long as you have the courage to continue what he can do kill me okay they're not gonna kill me but what are they gonna do okay they're gonna put me in jail I didn't do anything illegal so there's gonna make me a martyr so the most important thing you do is that you keep going and and it's that sort of that sort of will to win and Andrew let me just say one more thing before you ask the next question I think the conservative movement and I think the Republicans I'm really concerned about the people that you and I would think are our allies because I think they are afraid of the flack they will get if they stand up for their own principles because when you do this and you do it well now you will be viciously and savagely assaulted and you will be maligned by people on your own side so really it's not the question is not so why is that yeah because because the question is not do you know how to be effective the question is do you have the will why is it because they because they control the means of disseminating information and then and CNN will run their Chiron the Washington Post will say we'll dig into your tax returns they will pick the target freeze it personalize it polarize it and they will they will assault your reputation and people on your side Andrew and this is like goes back to Sultan eats ins Gulag Archipelago the people on your side will sell you out for a penny well yeah that's what I want to know why it why is the right against you because you don't you don't get a lot of respect from the right they they actually they actually do come down on your obviously not as hard as the left but they do they do give you a hard time why is that why are you ostracized there well after this Twitter thing all the people who had negatively attacked me we're singing our praises but I don't mention name what but I think it's because Andrew and I don't I don't like to speculate motives all I can do is talk about you know psychology as I see it getting praised by the New York Times yeah feels so good it feels so good so when that political reporter that New York Times reporter and says well O'Keefe you know looks like he's in trouble what say you well I think that he's wrong and the ends don't justify the means they it's that that that they praise you and the problem is is that like we're creating us in a nation of moral immoral felis cowards because all you have to do is sell out on your your friend when the going gets tough and Andrew most people live in fear even the people that love us and we have millions and millions of people who have our back those people live in fear they don't want their kids there's their names to be printed they don't want they want their kids to go to law school and what's happening is it taken to its extreme you have a nation of cowards who will sell each other out so that they're not targeted by the mainstream media and it's all just a little bit of history repeating yeah that so the book is American problem out of time but the book is American Pravda by James O'Keefe my fight for truth in the era of fake news can you tell me what project Veritas has coming up give me give us a preview well we just broke one of the biggest stories ever inside the Twitter I think big I think big tech is up is a big theme and I think I see more from us on those companies in the future James thanks a lot for coming on good luck i with a book and good luck with what you're doing come back again thank you really and I have to say the book is a surprisingly deep and rich read and it's looking forward to getting back into it let's do stuff I like you know one of the things I love is I I am a I they always call me a tough guy writer whenever they write about my fiction and I am and and I love tough guy actors obviously Humphrey Bogart Jimmy Cagney Edward II Robinson Alan Ladd one of the Forgotten tough-guy actors is John Garfield he was kind of like a second string guy although he did have a couple of really big hits he was in The Postman Always Rings Twice one of the great great tough-guy movies ever and he was in they me a criminal body in Seoul where he played a boxer in fact we have a quick clip from body and soul he played a boxer and here is a great scene it so in almost every boxing movie ever made where the gangsters come in and they want him to throw a fight and Garfield is the Baka the honest boxer people come and go besides I marry you as I like to watch it's rate for the title over than a kid I can beat him betting on yourself to win Charlie I didn't think you were punch-drunk yet well I think I can beat him you're not thinking Charlie a dream and it's only natural after all these years of living good fight now on there that don't roll and then the dough rolling out you begin to dream this can go on forever when I lose the championship they'll have to carry me out this gym is full of guys who were carried out mr. Roberts is right Shawn you'd like to see me take a tag wouldn't you no thanks Joe yeah how much of my money you got in the bank win how much you got charlie just as a side note if you're actually watching the guy in the background with the mustaches William Conrad one of the great radio talents of all time if you've ever heard of the old western Gunsmoke he invented the character Matt Dillon on the radio he was the announcer for rocky and bullwinkle he was just a terrific voice guy and also one of the great tough-guy actors he was he was in a wonderful wonderful movie version of Ernest Hemingway story the killers and he went on to play cannon on TV the fat detective because he was overweight but anyway well so I love tough guy actors and of course they're in short supply because so much of the movies are getting taken over by kind of wimpy stories but recently well back in 2000 I went and saw pitch black and that was one of Vin Diesel's first films and I remember literally walking I walked out of the movie picked up my cell phone as I'm walking out of the theater door and called my agent and I said if you have never seen this guy Vin Diesel you want to see him because he is a great tough-guy actor now the Dean's List career has not been as satisfying as I wanted it to be all the time he obviously he's in the Fast and Furious franchises he's set for life but I always felt in his in his independent films the films that weren't part of series he tries to send the kind of moral love me message which takes away from his tough-guy persona which is a shame but in pitch black he is absolutely riveting that's the first Riddick picture here's just a quick clip all you people are so scared of me but it ain't me that'll worry about now show me your eyes Riddick did I kill it yeah I mean it just shows it takes a great writer to make a great tough-guy actor but it's still he still is terrific but the guy that I have recently discovered is Jon Bernthal and Bernthal is a real actor like he actually can play different kinds of parts but he has recently become the Punisher on Netflix and The Punisher you know it's really entertaining exceptionally violent I mean it's comic-book violence but it's very violent and it's got some stuff in it there's some left-wing garbage it's all written by women not Lee enough it's all the writers are women but it's it's got as some left-wing garbage like all the terrorists or white veterans and all the bad guy is not the only only Muslim and it is the good girl and it's just she's got that all this kind of left wing talking points although it does have some pro-gun messaging it however however Bernthal is delivers one of the genuinely riveting tough-guy performances he just plays a marine recon guy even though the Punisher from the Marvel stories I don't like comic book stories but this kind of goes beyond that because it's really just a Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer character amped up to a comic book level and Bernthal delivers this character he absolutely gets him just dead right it is a great hey I mean a genuinely great tough-guy performance here's just a little bit as he's trying to talk one of our many white Christian terrorists as he's trying to talk him down stop him from killing a girl he likes you can maybe you alright maybe only what you are the same baby this is the way suppose that like just just you and me though right we just you and me and Obama can walking let's do it okay let's do it we worth Curtis you told me to pull that white wire you did the right thing kid you could do it again let her go would you did your father teach you not to hurt a woman let the girl go everybody I won't go to a movie Alyssa has the line let the girl go in it I think that's her that's what movies are all about Jon Bernthal a really really promising tough-guy actor I hope he gets more parts like this because he just understands this part down to the ground and he's a really good actor actor -
