the city of Chicago has just surpassed 600 homicides for 2017 but if we discuss why this is happening we're labeled racists and white supremacists according to the Chicago Tribune Chicago is now at 602 homicides for 2017 they ended 2016 with 791 homicides but we're not allowed to talk about his data that comes to us from the FBI Chicago Police Department and various other government agencies that data tells us that 93 percent of these homicides are black on black crime but if we dare say it if we dare talk about facts statistics and data we're labeled racist were labeled white supremacists it's terrible young black men we're the main culprits are committing murder or being murdered are being incarcerated at numbers magnitudes higher than the representation in the population now that is an epidemic that's a public safety epidemic it's a public health epidemic and to me not talking about it's racist but even black media even black media is trying to suppress the truth I found this website black America web it's a black lifestyle site and on that site comedian D H Hughley has his own section now UB is a big name by any standards not just in black entertainment the guy to hit television show he fills venues whenever he does a stand-up comedy this guy is a big star and on his part of the site I found this article and it says quote one of the many efforts by white racists to demonize black people has been stopped dead in its tracks but that hasn't thanks to some updated statistics provided by the federal government unlike what appears to be popular opinion the rate of violent black on black crime is lower than how often white criminals victimize other white people except that's not true so either those writing this article grossly misunderstood the data for a willfully misrepresenting the data to their audience to mislead their audience and to stifle data that doesn't fit their narrative they go on to say quote the rate of white-on-white violent crime is twelve incidents per 1000 people that's accurate and that's about four times higher than black-on-white violent-crime 3.1 per 1000 now that's true but what they're omitting what they're omitting well that's some egregious behavior it's highly irresponsible let me read you all the numbers so yes so yes white-on-white violent crime twelve incidents per 1000 people black on white violent crime is 3.1 per 1000 people but what they left out is that black on black violent crime is 16 incidents per 1000 people 16 incidents per 1000 people or and a half more incidents for 1000 people of black on black crime and there is white on white crime despite blacks being 1/6 the u.s. population of whites white on black violent crime is 2.8 per 1000 black on white violent crime is 3.1 per 1000 black on white violent crime is slightly higher than white on black violent crime despite blacks being 1/6 the population of whites the crime rates in the black community are soaring they are much magnitudes higher than any other racial or ethnic group and lying to your audience about it actually if you're a black media outlet is terrible now those numbers focused on all violent crime and that was from federal government's Bureau of Justice Statistics the definitive Authority let's look at the murder number now the FBI collects homicide data and they have supplemental homicide reports so the FBI typically doesn't list all the homicides but there is enough to pick up the trend lines and according to the FBI in 2016 their Uniform Crime reporting the FBI UCR which is the Bible of crime data this is pretty new data I'd only come out a couple of months ago in 2016 there were 6,000 95 blacks who committed murder as opposed to five thousand and four whites who committed murder one thousand more blacks committed murder then did whites despite blacks being 1/6 the population of whites in the United States according to the US Census Bureau when we look at some subsets of data data that was crunched there's there's one set of data here they analyzed two thousand eight hundred and seventy black homicide victims and found that their murderers were black assailants in two thousand five hundred and seventy of those cases comporting with that 93 percent number yet we're not allowed to talk about this and the bodies keep dropping in cities like Chicago the these numbers are unsustainable they're unsustainable and data doesn't lie facts don't lie the FBI's Uniform Crime reporting and the Bureau of Justice Statistics don't lie they don't have an agenda they don't have a racial bias they just want to see homicides stop and we should all want to see young black men live productive successful lives not wind up dead not wind up in prison the data though tells a very different story and if we're not allowed to talk about this I fear the numbers in Chicago are only going to rise and Chicago might very well end 2017 with a higher number than 2016 791 homicides if you like this content as
