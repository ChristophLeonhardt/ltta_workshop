1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be living under a rock to</font>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,720
not know that police brutality is a

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,160
hot-button issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this country right</font>

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">now and you'd have to be living under a</font>

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,189
rock to think that filming things

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:25,830
doesn't have an impact hey I'm obvious

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,810
Shapiro I'm a staff writer at vice news

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,940
going going good I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few questions</font>

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,170
for you fire away man if if law

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,460
enforcement agents are acting in

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">accordance with the law what are their</font>

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,150
arguments against<font color="#E5E5E5"> being filmed and are</font>

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,920
they valid arguments well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,119
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to answer this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,470
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about an interaction I saw</font>

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,290
between police and harlem and some

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,340
people who are watching them with

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,229
cameras when they are doing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay</font>

31
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,659
and basically the police were saying to

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,850
the cop<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watchers you know your time</font>

33
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,710
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much better spent go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,720
the projects you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know down the street</font>

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,640
and film some crime and then bring us

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,689
the tape and then you know that that to

37
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">me is an argument you can make against</font>

38
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,770
filming the police that is a waste of

39
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">time that if you really cared about</font>

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,979
bringing down crime you'd go look for

41
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,930
criminals it you can be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> judge if you</font>

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's a strong argument the cop</font>

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,720
watchers said that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,479
police's job and their job is you know

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,180
to catch the police if they mess up so

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,020
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's one of the</font>

47
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,549
more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> arguments I've heard</font>

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,280
against filming the police okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,140
opinion do you think the implementation

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,420
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like body cameras or even just being</font>

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,160
filmed by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private citizen or whatever</font>

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,020
do you think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,480
that liability's handled when police

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,830
misconduct occurs

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,420
well body cameras are a really

56
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,060
interesting issue because you know now

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,770
we're we're putting more and more body

58
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,540
cameras on cops across the country so

59
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,130
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reasonable question</font>

60
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,840
would be does that make cop watching

61
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,990
obsolete and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you ask</font>

62
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,400
cop Watchers about that and you actually

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask experts who study you know police</font>

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,750
brutality there's a real difference

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,510
between a camera that's focused on out

66
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,030
from the police's chest and cameras that

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,470
are actually focused on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police</font>

68
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,700
themselves it's a completely different

69
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective and it's really important to</font>

70
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,300
catch the whole scene so cop<font color="#CCCCCC"> Watchers</font>

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,250
bring a totally different angle to the

72
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,720
situation and on top of that there's a

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,030
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases of police turning off their</font>

74
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,670
cameras tampering<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the cameras and</font>

75
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,220
the end of the day as we know the police

76
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,200
are the ones who get to decide when they

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,660
release the footage so body cameras

78
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,250
definitely throw an interesting new

79
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,140
dynamic into the mix but it's it's a

80
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">very different it's a very different</font>

81
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,910
thing than then a third party you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

82
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple feet away filling with their own</font>

83
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,730
camera at their own footage<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

84
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,340
only talk with cough Watchers or you

85
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to police</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> officers also well my</font>

86
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,510
colleague Tess and I spoke to some

87
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,489
retired police officers you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when we</font>

88
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,440
reached out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the NYPD to talk about</font>

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Copwatch they weren't responsive you</font>

90
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,580
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a pretty it's rain I</font>

91
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean it's a it's a pretty sticky issue</font>

92
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,180
for them and a lot of these new more

93
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,950
prominent cop Watchers in the city like

94
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,810
Jose<font color="#E5E5E5"> LaSalle who's a main character in</font>

95
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,060
our piece um get in trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

96
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">police all the time they're constantly</font>

97
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,820
being arrested they're constantly

98
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,010
accusing the NYPD of harassing them and

99
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">ypd so you know I think it's something</font>

100
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch and they</font>

101
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,959
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about though you know</font>

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,489
it should be noted that in the NYPD

103
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,489
patrol guide it's clearly stated that

104
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,050
it's legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to film the police and their</font>

105
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,910
official position is that you know

106
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">filming the police is something that is</font>

107
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,080
a citizen's right right yeah and

108
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,940
personally I feel you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know our tax when</font>

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,360
departments and you know our lives are

111
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,880
ultimately in their control you know

112
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,100
institute certain situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font>

113
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,860
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important that we do get to film them</font>

114
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,540
and that there are body cameras and

115
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,140
stuff like cop<font color="#CCCCCC"> watches allowed yeah yeah</font>

116

123
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,270
that cop watch it doesn't actually

124
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,009
police the police that implies that they

125
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,139
have any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of authority how many cops</font>

126
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,180
have a cop watch put away well that's

127
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,569
that's a good question Eric you know

that and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question we get</font>

129
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,030
different answers to if you ask

different<font color="#CCCCCC"> copwatch crews in different</font>

131
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,599
cities so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cop watch crew in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland which is quite</font>

133

active that they they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take credit for</font>

134
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,470
putting a couple officers<font color="#CCCCCC"> off-duty</font>

135
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,539
getting them early retirement with

136
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:03,220
footage they gather during some Occupy

137

Wall Street protest a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

138
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,020
but you know it's it's not something

139
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is easy to document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when these</font>

140
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,099
disciplinary proceedings are often done

141
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,930
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind closed doors and people</font>

142
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,699
people aren't sure you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

143
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,590
was the piece of evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

144
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,680
got a cop on early retired or put them

145

<font color="#E5E5E5">on desk duty the question about</font>

146
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,970
Authority is pretty interesting I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

147
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,620
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can all agree that over the</font>

148
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,050
last year with the you know videos

149
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,759
coming out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Eric Gardner and</font>

150
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,979
Freddie gray that these videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

151
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,330
maybe they don't have any official legal

152
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,620
authority but they certainly pack a

153
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,900
punch and they have they have a serious

154
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">impact I mean if you can if you can</font>

155
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,000
launch a thousand people into the

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,190
streets of Baltimore with you know or if

157
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,750
you can if you can launch a thousand

158
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,219
people into Union Square in New York

159
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,320
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the help of video evidence you're</font>

160
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,060
really there's a real impact here to

161
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,389
these videos and the question of whether

162
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,340
specific officers have been put away for

163
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,319
specific videos is something that is

164
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,030
harder to nail down but I think we can

165
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">say with confidence that um they pack a</font>

166
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,699
punch<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so Eric I hope that</font>

167
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,699

172
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,919
the first one is you know what petitions

173
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:23,110
do we have in the police as you know

174
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,990
private citizens<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what purchases do we</font>

175
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,509
you know have yeah i mean that's that's

176
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,460
a really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and that's a</font>

177
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,719
question you'll get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different answer</font>

178
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,969
to depending on who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask i think</font>

179
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,270
first of all it's pretty much

180
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,229
universally acknowledged<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

181
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,870
right to film in public you know is for

182
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,120
amendment right to film in public and

183
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,820
take pictures in public<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I you</font>

184
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,200
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say when it comes to</font>

185
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,490
you know cop watching is that as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

186
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,170
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not interfering with what the</font>

187
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,910
officer is doing as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

188
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,830
keeping a safe distance away what you're

189
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,780
doing is lawful now there are certain

190
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,160
cases where the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to make a</font>

191
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,950
claim about wiretapping laws or make the

192
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,660
claim that the active filming in itself

193
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,220
is interfering with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing</font>

194
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,900
but i would say on the whole that you're

195
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,180
you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> good solid ground if your</font>

196
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,250
cameras in view your not interfering and

197
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,200
you have a wide berth between yourself

198
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,880
and the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what the aclu</font>

199
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,470
will tell you and that's what these cop

200
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,580
watch teams will tell you if you ask

201
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so what would be some best</font>

202
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,400
practices that you would advise for

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,930
people who are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching the</font>

204
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,480

205
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">never watched the cops I've just watched</font>

people who watch the console us so i

207
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,450
wouldn't say like I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the guy</font>

261
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,530
let's take a quick Twitter interlude and

262
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,240
let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> go look at this question that we</font>

263
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,340
got from DJ DJ wants to know how

264
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,320
citizens should deal with officers who

265
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,330
are forcibly attempting to prevent them

266
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,020
from filming what's the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

267
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,610
respond to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what did you you</font>

268
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,550
learn from your cop friends well you

269
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,100
know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real issue and</font>

270
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,410
there are definitely cases that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear</font>

271
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,420
about around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country police officers</font>

272
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,910
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have told citizens they don't have</font>

273
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,110
the right to film in a certain situation

274
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,890
and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say that most of the</font>

275
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,870
time the officer is going to be making a

276
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,730
claim that they their job is being

277
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,550
interfered with at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment so so the</font>

278
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,980
way to avoid this is to step back ask

279
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,800
the you know the in the ACLU or any cop

280
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,790
Archer will tell you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should</font>

281
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,650
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the cops if you're free to go</font>

282
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,870
and if they say you're free to go you're

283
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">not being detained you know in a tense</font>

284
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,250
situation on the streets if you're

285
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,680
filming something cops can cops can get

286
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,200
anxious and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they can give you</font>

287
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,970
and you know knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your rights is</font>

288
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,010
really important before you you go out

289
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,460
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do this sort of thing um so</font>

290
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah definitely be prepared but at base</font>

291
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,950
level you're allowed to film the police

292
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,870
so you know you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be confident in</font>

293
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that alright cool so I hope that answers</font>

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,309
that's an interesting question<font color="#CCCCCC"> um i</font>

312
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,189
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all i would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

313
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:41,379
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a distinction between</font>

314
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,970
everyday people who bust out their

315
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,379
camera when they see something they

316
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,869
think is whack on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street and caught</font>

317
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:49,850
the cop watch teams that you know my

318
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,350
colleague test and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i spent a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time</font>

319
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,089
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you though these people take</font>

320
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,129
training very seriously these cop watch

321
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,600
teams you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones in Oakland and</font>

322
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,999
Baltimore and Ferguson and the ones in

323
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,470
Harlem we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent time with you know they</font>

324
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,729
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly they are putting a</font>

325
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,019
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more thought and care into what</font>

326
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're doing out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the streets and</font>

327
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,419
most journalists I know we're putting

328
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:10,699
into their thought process before they

329
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:11,839
go out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do an interview you know I</font>

330
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,109
mean but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I the question to the question</font>

331
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,789
about individual citizens who busts out

332
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:20,539
their cell phones I mean it's true that

333
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,279
you know if you're not someone who's

334
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,869
thought a lot about what it means the

335
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,429
implications of filming the police it

336
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:28,819
could get hairy but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the goals of</font>

337
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:30,980
these cop watch teams that you know Tess

338
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,739
and I profiled is to educate people

339
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,869
about how to best film the police so you

340
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,789
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ultimate goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot</font>

341
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these groups is to make this</font>

342
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,749
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> widely dispersed to put on</font>

343
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,850
trainings to engage as many people as

344
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,499
possible that is so that if really

345
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,029
anyone in a neighborhood that's heavily

346
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,149
policed see something going on they they

347
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:51,799
think is wrong that they have sort of

348
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,539
the basic knowledge about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to film it</font>

349
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,009
safely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and legally that's fantastic</font>

350
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's great to hear and then I have one</font>

351
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,209
more and so with so many people

352
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,789
independently recording complexes

353
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,589
believe what all of these citizen

354
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,809
activists be considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> journalists at</font>

355
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,029
this point and what defines being a

356
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,309
journalist today sorry could you repeat

357
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:18,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um basically a site</font>

358
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,030
with so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

359
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">ently recording conflict with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pleased</font>

360
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,650
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an activist be</font>

361
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,610
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> journalist and if so what</font>

362
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,130
constitutes being a journalist today

363
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,390
what constitutes being a journalist

364
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:38,060
today what what a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think do</font>

365
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,410
I have an awesome answer to that

366
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,180
probably not I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're right</font>

367
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,190
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the lines between what it</font>

368
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,320
means to be an activist or a citizen or

369
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">a reporter are blurring when you can</font>

370
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,130
throw whatever you want on the

371
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet and you know it can go viral</font>

372
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,660
and then you're the source and no

373
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,310
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no journalist mediating but i</font>

374
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,690
guess i would say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who</font>

375
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,920
are doing this work don't consider

376
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,410
themselves journalists right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean no</font>

377
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">one you would ask who does Copwatch says</font>

378
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,010
I'm a journalist you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're</font>

379
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">activists and they have a political</font>

380
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,340
agenda like a strong political agenda

381
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,580
that they that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to advance</font>

382
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,170
and it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do with police</font>

383
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,760
accountability some of them it has to do

384
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,310
with police abolition you know it runs a

385
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,830
wide there's a wide gamut of opinions

386
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,020
but you know the distinction<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

387
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,030
someone like myself who covers this and

388
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,400
a cop watch of themselves is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no I'm</font>

389
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in understanding why they do</font>

390
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,390
it and and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interested in</font>

391
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,080
enacting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like radical reform in the way</font>

392
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,890

for you cool so person first of all if I

404
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,930
read your article and based on the tone

405
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,610
of it it appears that the police

406
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,410
department's<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding the cap watches</font>

407
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,380
Watchers to be a nuisance do you know if

408
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,940
they've had any positive reactions by

409
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the police or at least a level of</font>

410
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,560
understanding why these citizens are

411
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,590
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way to film them you know</font>

412
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,770
that's a great question um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

413
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">know personally for my reporting I</font>

414
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,990
didn't come across you know any cops who

415
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,819
were really excited about being filmed

416
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,970
I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I I have heard from cop</font>

417
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,499
watchers who<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know off the</font>

418
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,239
record police will certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> police</font>

419
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,269
officers will say hey like we see some

420
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:43,979
crazy out there we're glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

421
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,649
there but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you know and and the</font>

422
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,600
retired police officer who tests and I

423
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,369
reached out to acknowledge that you know

424
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:51,959
please you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be living under a</font>

425
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,179
rock to not know that police brutality

426
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,949
is a hot-button<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue in this country</font>

427
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now and you'd have to be living</font>

428
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,799
under a rock to think that filming

429
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,289
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have an impact so you</font>

430
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,789
know I think police<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledge the</font>

431
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,519
climate that they're swimming in but you

432
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,699
know the police that we observed

433
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,279
reporting this story definitely you know

434
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,769
were made to feel differently when when

435
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,449
when these cameras were there and that's

436
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:16,529
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main points of the story</font>

437
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:18,569
right is that like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they do act</font>

438
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,699
differently and they do feel reined in

439
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,039
and they do feel watched and that's

440
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,419
something the cop watchers are trying to

441
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,489
achieve and I think you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone</font>

442
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,319
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job and started filming you</font>

443
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,959
when you were at work you would you

444
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,279
wouldn't be you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be stoked about</font>

445
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,929
it right i mean you you would we prefer

446
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,129
they don't don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but you know</font>

447
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and I my job doesn't</font>

448
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,999
involve<font color="#E5E5E5"> like potentially using lethal</font>

449
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,299
force on people so you know the argument

450
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,949
the cop watches are making is that yes

451
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,479
maybe this kind of sucks if you're a

452
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,739
police officer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are following</font>

453
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,269
you around with cameras but if you're

454
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:49,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna pick to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job where you are</font>

455
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,329
legally allowed to hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> people this</font>

456
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,269
might come<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the territory know</font>

457
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,339
exactly I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

458
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,589
you're like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying our jobs if</font>

459
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,419
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for anyone to so much</font>

460
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,249
because we're not public servants or not

461
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:05,429
being paid by the taxpayers to you know

462
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:10,049
protect communities yeah exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

you mentioned that you reached out for

466
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,209
the NYPD and you got no comment they

467
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,980
didn't want anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

468
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the retired police officers that</font>

469
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,599
you tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interview was there any</font>

470
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,599
that gave you problems with them you

471
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,669
know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be interviewed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or did you</font>

472
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:31,889
get any like strange reactions from them

473
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:34,379
or so like what kind of reactions did

474
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:38,009
you get um you know the one retired

475
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,110
police officer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Tess and I included</font>

476
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the piece had an understanding and I</font>

477
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:44,250
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think honestly like after</font>

478
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,500
you've left the police force and they

479
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,030
you have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to reflect on this</font>

480
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,620
like and you're seeing it from a bit of

481
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,880
an outsider perspective you might

482
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,250
understand the inclination to film the

483
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,570
cops I mean to directly answer your

484
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,430
question like my interaction with

485
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,230
actually police officers reporting the

486
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,810
story was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't a very rich</font>

487
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,850
interaction for I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty obvious</font>

488
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,610
reasons when we set out to report the

489
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece we did really want to do a piece</font>

490
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,200
about cop watch that showed both the

491
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,720
police and the cop Watchers and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

492
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,000
dynamic developed because I agree with

493
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a fascinating question right I</font>

494
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,440
mean like what like in their private

495
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,940
moments like how do these police

496
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,500
officers feel about being surveilled I I

497
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,280
would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know and but I can tell</font>

498
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,020
you that we did observe a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of these</font>

499
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,870
interactions like on the ground between

500
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,400
cop washers and please and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

501
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,450
what you'd expect you know there's a lot

502
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">of joking around there's a lot of</font>

503
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,630
recognition like oh you're back

504
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,040
like I said like I remember you from

505
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,260
last night I mean there's so there's a

506
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of our like a familiarity that</font>

507
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,920
builds with some of these like heavy

508
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,770
hardcore cop<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watchers like Jose in our</font>

509
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,910
piece um but and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't it like I</font>

510
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't able to like pull the cops aside</font>

511
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,600
and get them to stay on the record like

512
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,140
hey like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucks or this is</font>

513
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best like I'm so glad they're here</font>

514
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,530
because my buddies sometimes go off the

515
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,900
rails so yeah I'm like hey have you got

516
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,130
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any police friends who want</font>

517
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,300
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me about what it feels like</font>

518
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,520
to be watched like definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

519
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">know well I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cop friends</font>

520
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the moment but when i do i'll send</font>

521
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your way one other question in your</font>

522
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,450
article he also mentioned that some of

523
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,920
the members of cop watch have been

524
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,570
harassed or monitored by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the police yeah</font>

525
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,490
by speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them what was the</font>

526
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,530
furthest you heard the police gone to

527
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,120
try to deter the communities from

528
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,190
filming them like the extreme cases um

529
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,650
yeah I mean I think you know with this

530
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,210
stuff it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to verify right i</font>

531
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,650
mean there was a great report in the

532
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,260
intercept a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks back about you</font>

533
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,380
know NYPD surveillance of black lives

534
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,470
matter protesters and some cop<font color="#CCCCCC"> watchers</font>

535
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,970
and you know it was they found documents

536
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,179
that showed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NYPD has singled</font>

537
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:00,360
out

538
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
Jose<font color="#CCCCCC"> lassalle who is the one of the most</font>

539
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,040
prominent cop<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watchers in Harlem had</font>

540
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,200
circulated his picture and noted his

541
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,450
presence at<font color="#E5E5E5"> protests so at the very base</font>

542
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,910
we mean but the rationale behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

543
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cop watch and</font>

544
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,940
that it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dennis Flores</font>

545
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,490
who does cop watch in calamba down in

546
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,920
Brooklyn<font color="#E5E5E5"> has also made accusations that</font>

547
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,990
the NYPD is followed him around and

548
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,280
intimidated him but at the end of the

549
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,410
day you know yeah there hasn't been to

550
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,929
my knowledge a clear-cut case where a

551
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,900
cop watcher has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to prove XYZ</font>

552
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,880
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been harassed for cop watch</font>

553
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,679
but anecdotally and talking to cop

554
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,240
Watchers I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be surprised if</font>

555
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,640
there's a lot of tension and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

556
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,320
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there's an</font>

557
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,640
antagonistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship that</font>

558
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,110
definitely develops and it's especially

559
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're going to be like a public face</font>

560
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:49,320
of cop watch like some of these people

561
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,000
choose to be you're definitely putting a

562
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,130
target on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> back I mean the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> police</font>

563
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,340
are going to know who you are right

564
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,179
right so I figured yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 last question</font>

565
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,360
on if you're the like the members of cap

566
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,270
watch were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopeful in their efforts</font>

567
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,520
of filming the police that they you know

568
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,290
they hope this would invoke change

569
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,120
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the police department I think you</font>

570
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,220
you brought some figure in like maybe

571
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,080
like pointy to change like point zero

572
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
one percent or something very marginal

573
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,630
amount so i imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

574
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,549
discouraged when they go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> film</font>

575
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,120
and see that no change has been made so

576
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering like what specifically</font>

577
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,320
where the cop watch members discouraged

578
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,540
about because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're one thing that</font>

579
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,330
they keep mentioning yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

580
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,919
it's really important to keep in mind

581
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like so the cop like the political</font>

582
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,320
goals and look even views on policing in

583
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,059
the cop watch movement or quite broad

584
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,660
it's a diffuse movement city by city<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

585
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,669
it ranges from people who want to see

586
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,799
you reform of the police<font color="#CCCCCC"> department we</font>

587
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,360
the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> police</font>

588
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,130
abolished and you all you have them all

589
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,840
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the umbrella of cop watch so um</font>

590
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'd say that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are less focused on</font>

591
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,340
the numbers coming out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> police</font>

592
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,370
brutality cases and murder or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police</font>

593
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,870
you know pls killings and prosecutions

594
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,920
and more

595
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,630
focus on the ways that they can on the

596
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,450
streets flip the tables on police in an

597
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,790
interaction by interaction basis right

598
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,680
so I mean one of the things i focused on

599
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,210
in the piece which i think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

600
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,920
important is the way that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

601
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,950
presence of a uniformed disciplined

602
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Copwatch team how that just changes the</font>

603
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,200
flavor of an on the street interaction

604
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,640
between police and citizens right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

605
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where the</font>

606
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,660
results aren't discouraging from a cop

607
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Watchers perspective that you know</font>

608
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,920
they're there they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when</font>

609
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,930
they're there they're changing that

610
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,060
dynamic on the ground and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping</font>

611
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,200
that that will build the sort of

612
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,540
momentum they need to make you know in

613
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,570
their view policing more fair and more

614
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,910
just but yeah you're right i mean the

615
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,290
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did we crunched some</font>

616
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,120
numbers you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple months back</font>

617
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,110
that showed like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1.5 percent of civilian</font>

618
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,280
killings resulted in i think it was even

619
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,200
an indictment or a prosecution so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

620
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean if you look at the numbers you know</font>

621
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,040
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of evidence that</font>

622
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,960
probably you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that police brutality</font>

623
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,550
or police killings are getting taken to

624
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,460
trial and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that that</font>

625
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,290
that is definitely discouraging but

626
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,630
there's hope in kop watcher see hope and

627
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,290
the person by person interactions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

628
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,120
yeah I hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped is all my</font>

629
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,680
question yeah I think all right hey Sean

630
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,430
thanks for coming on so obvi I reaching

631
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,630
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's a</font>

632
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,790
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got on Twitter a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

633
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,350
tongue-in-cheek but take a look at this

634
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,990
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mountain wants to know who police's</font>

635
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,600
the people that police the police so a

636
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,270
lot of police in there but basically

637
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,070
he's wondering who's responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

638
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,470
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> cop watch and making sure</font>

639
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,500
they're following<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules um yeah I</font>

640
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,180
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the simple answer that</font>

641
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,130
question is the police to add another

642
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,370
police into the mix um you know as I was

643
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">just saying on the police taken upon</font>

644
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,540
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean police know who these</font>

645
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,110
cop watchers are and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can guarantee you</font>

646
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if they begin to step out of line</font>

647
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

648
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">get help for it so though if you would</font>

649
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,850
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start Anton of policing the</font>

650
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,630
people who police the

651
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,420
police patrol<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

652
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,510
that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an interesting new layer</font>

653
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,630
yeah so the the serious answer is that

654
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,950
you know cop watches<font color="#CCCCCC"> our police like</font>
