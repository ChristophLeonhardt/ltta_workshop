tell me so you've read about my stuff and you live in Bradford don't know about the Urbana burger and everything like this elbow you can't oh it's out you've got you looking at my Twitter yes this one Twitter there about and really not really nice thing to say about you people saying about me yeah because you know what are they saying racist and also what else are they saying I've said a quick glance if it reads or they say read out some readers if you know got your glasses you left it behind when you came for your food can you read it at all want me to read it I won't read the good ones who are there what are they like object is it made comments about this what does field was yesterday oh the Huddersfield the Muslim grooming gang majority Pakistani Muslim grooming gangs oh okay what about when there's 30 of them yeah just like it could be roll palace and he's been Jimmy Savile yeah I always hear that judges and the friends in Catholic priests please I don't think I'll sit there or Catholic priests I do quite a lot I did the men are mostly men do this men are men there whether they're black white or you know the day not because they're their religion doesn't teach you to just a flower is it it's just them as sad individuals me not nothing to do it be Muslim most people teach stuff like that I said I'm not educated enough to tell you about what Muslims you are you have your own opinion so you have your own brought up to do that you know treat women like you know daughters mothers sisters wives I think the day that if that the punishment for them under Islamic law is a lot of Harsha here why let me ask you a couple things it really opened me because I think your beauty you'll be really mad what you'll say really we don't hear your view at all where we are in London you don't hear gentlemen from Bradford going actually this isn't suited me so let me say the Huddersfield list was 30 men charged with grooming young girls blah blah blah everything will no more matte list such a bit locked up for a long time end of do you think we hear enough of that so it my criticism would be I don't hear maybe I don't look for it or maybe I don't see it I don't hear Muslim man that much going this is horrific our community doesn't do this demands in a condo and behavioral I know between the Condor net there's a ridiculous and end of the day look at it well like I said all the white Englishmen Catholic priests whatever they're judging whatever they are policemen grooming ribs what might all them is it because it's Muslim do they get extra sent us on because they've got Muslim name to they get extra time for that and those two things one thing I always think well a Jimmy Savile a Rolf Harris whoever whatever in Catholic priests doesn't make it okay but these guys are doing it it doesn't make it okay that they did it none of it's okay I wish we agree so that argument doesn't work because we all agree nothing said yeah but then I look at that list of those names from Huddersfield yesterday and every single one of them appears to me to be and I could be wrong yeah a Pakistani Muslim man and then I'm like but what is it about being a Pakistani Muslim and that makes it okay what we hear is it's okay for that those guys do think women like me my daughters are white slacks is that what some people think and where are they getting it from who's to say that you've got the answer I'm just not not the majority there's a small amount II just like these a small minority of white people white Catholics wherever they are they do the same stuff but end of the day media wants to sell newspapers and get more hits yeah so you put the Muslim coming in and then it grazes it does your father oh and not for me the fight for me is about my I've got a 14 year old daughter all those girls yes they've 4:14 I've got 16 dollars and anything the day I probably should be there maybe I'd probably do worse you do worst I do work yeah well we could join together I would do the same I would do this and they wouldn't look again I wouldn't have it you'd do anything that I want you had a chance to do something as a parent you'd do exactly the same as me I would know I know we would do the same because to your child and I think it's an important message and I think it's an input what you're saying is really important and what what we could do more what I could do with more it's not about I can you could say I don't give stuff what you think Kate's got kids and I get that too plenty of people say shut your face you Islamophobic old racist old cow I know that but I can't help but feel too many people do turn a blind eye to this where our help me understand where's the mom or the dad of that guy who turned into a grooming gang member how what happens to people same with the white Catholic do this I'm in traffic these kids sell heroin drug there's just their dirty little circle I like the wide you know whatever they are they all the same they all need cash you know I agree with you entirely you and I have to save you entirely and then the police have been said social services it was said we're too frightened to talk about it because they both said that they were two friends talk about it we didn't want to be called racist or affirm the Muslim community it's not about the Muslim it's about those people they should be dealt with by the laws the land which they you know we've got to respect the laws of London so they should be dealt with in with whatever manna whether it's five years 10 years 15 years 20 years Kandra they should be getting little sentences they should be getting long sentences as a - tell it to others because like that Rochdale got that TV problem I watched it most honestly I was horrified and not now it's not nice because like you know revolve up kids hmm they should be dealt with and social surface they're not doing their job if they're scared of saying something if that person there is not doing their job there should be out somebody else should be there doing a job and chasing people and you you were don't you in pepper or you work somewhere I've been born already yeah how many generations of your family knew my father came in the 1960s and then is your dad still alive I'm sorry so my question and one of the things I say and I'm thinking of things now but I say that really annoy people because I think I could you say why this is oh look what the white lace is for you yeah he does the touchy you try working with that that is that is hard no a racist is or a rapido or whatever the Catholic Church are sometimes it was abundantly why the weave the first day - probably that long long time ago now this is there still a good mixture people the end of the day that our neighbors where there's a Hindu man across the road we've never really small contained because I don't speak to my neighbors either a Muslim thing I don't know but he's got broken into the other day me in the rhythm came out to talk to morning and after that came to see peas all right yeah and we disturbed him for doing that but now he says hello neighbor right black-white see Muslim we all live together and end of the day there's nothing can I show you another question and I'm asking as a person who can answer me honestly as honestly can tell me when that we have the grooming gangs thing we're at nod with Jing er happens on both sides white Muslim whatever but do you think it's helpful let's say the lists from Huddersfield Pakistani Muslim men do you think it's helpful when the media used the term Asian I find it really annoying the word Asian because to me it lumps in I hope they should state the people from where they come from and not beat around the bush that's what I feel most when you put Muslim there could be a white person there yo slim so Muslim covers all colors yes I totally agree yes agent so I'll call it south vision whatever you know took over yet Pakistanis if you want to cover a lot Muslim covers anywhere any country in the world any shape size color and it took anybody from blonde a blue eyes yeah I've met one who wants to meet me here rapid actually who's a convert but whatever yeah exactly so it could be anyone anywhere and when you see someone like me not necessarily me or my face because we can all have comments about that but when you see women or your children your daughters or I have daughters do you think the Western Way is is kind of the wrong way the way that we would be or my daughters might be in shorts and t-shirt the whole relaxed anything I don't I flow skimpy clothes and you know so do I actually because right now I don't mind you know I know there's registers out those people are going that is predicted wherever that you don't know where that your teachers schools religious places James Marshall you don't know who they are where they are to look I see what you're saying well then I think it goes to the other extreme once you get into the whole burqa headrest nicob face covering only eyes I find that I do find that weird I do I find that weird to me because there's nothing for them to look at you know they're not gonna you know the can't see they can't see anything so there's just lead them to it that normally they get a lot more discreet they get a lot more expect ask anyone know who asked this common ask the ladies that's one of the reasons I did come to ask exactly that question why did you wear that because you know all the clear base for your man not for everyone but if you can't get like we're in the cafe right let's just say there isn't noodles on here but there's there's like sandwiches or there's like check potatoes with cheese and beans if I try and eat that in a face fail that's not going to go well maybe you have to go but weird like to me that's weird and I've seen women eat spaghetti with them on and it's a nightmare and then I'm like why would you do that do you not think it's a bit there's a lot more than just eating yeah but to eat it's brimming hard and I'm sure it's not that well I think you should put one on and give it a whirl I didn't usually put one okay you walk down the street as you are now and you walk on with the bird but I'll sit and we'll see him it will see you at what really response you'll get what I know I'm tempted to do it what do you think is let's so let me set this challenge up I won't run as I am see what happens I say oh that doesn't happen but let's go with let's go with the example what will happen if I'm in a burqa I'll have a better time but then is it up to you know that so this is where the feminists and I'm not one of them yeah not one of the screaming burn your bra wear a silly hat on your head um they would say well mentioned be looking at women naughty that's very naughty why they are and if but it might be em but if I have those I would get them out I would yes all of them I saw other people do discernment you just like to get if I just like to have boobs I would I would but that's a private issue isn't it project okay let me ask you another thing that I say that annoys people and I'm reason I'm asking is because you're being kind enough to listen and you're happy that I'm asking you I say if Islam so fantastic why do muslims come to Western countries why not stay in countries that are really Islamic as like proper it's not because England needed people so our parents came after our fathers fathers they came to help build this country go working with working generation for generations to fight whatever you agreed so I was tend to get on quite well with older and worked harder actually then a lot of British nationals what I see that I see that all over the place now tell me same in Sweden actually the old generations I get on well with why the newbies why do they come and why don't they want at work as hard if somebody wanted but they plenty do you know if they choose to get money from abroad yeah for whatever reason the person here has to be earning x y&z they have to come here they've got not easy diet they can't claim so so you have to work on the graph and they'll work harder than anybody here whether they're Muslim are a white non-muslim or whatever they are because they'll be they're gonna build a life here and they know and I buy into that for and many people but that also we do have statistics that are like X percent of Somalian refugees that arrive here or migrants don't work or a lot of women that don't work and so they don't want to work if they've got family they've got kids above policy leaders at war the can't work well about young kids I had kids I worked that's your choice yeah but I don't choose to pay for people that want to come to my country they want to stay at home end of the day husband's work you know the kids are working they might have little children anyway going back to my question why come to countries that aren't predominantly Islamic countries that's always lived here the new ones new ones that arrive here and then say if England so Islamophobic why is everyone coming born a red horn they've got work in the houses of a cog about everything hmm they're not gonna go and go live in the third world country are they where they worked so hard their parents worked so hard brought more educated and they're working so rather than going let me ask you a question I don't agree with Libya sending all of its people across the Mediterranean to come to Europe am I going to take your places and my places in my view do you agree with migrants coming across the Med they're being trafficked over the Med it's like a blooming ferry service it bothers me yeah bigger debate is on why certain countries have went to certain countries and so wedge its victims of what where do you want me to go you wipe them out you put them back to the Stone Age and anything stay there we'll do you send some cement and make you look more cause some certain countries are sending their armies there so what do you want him to do well gentlemen you go there take everything from them and what we're supposed to vote the gonna go they've got nowhere to go the cast important cells there's no infrastructure there's no jobs and there's no houses you know half the funds being wiped out all the farms being wiped out where they're supposed to go well how did how did your family find their way and start and make a living and further away they grafted and grafted I concerned I'm concerned that we're importing a whole world of people who don't want to work but see this place is some kind of Elysium you know this had an idea of this golden this place there's no provision they call me there on the breadline here there's certain charities that do a lot of work then on the bed line because when they come on a mosque on Friday those and it's not they don't just help Muslim people they help anybody any is homeless you know Muslims that they do help with the people lovely soup kitchens are here the food kitchens and all sorts but you'll never you will never go see the good side there no I don't know I didn't listen to you saying good stuff about Muslims I think that's I think that might be really untrue I think it's always surprising when people like me they don't they wouldn't even imagine we'd be sat here with that because they think you can speak to me and then I'd be like you
