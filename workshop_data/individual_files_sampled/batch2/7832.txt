takes you directly to our channel so what's on the channel well shows that you're familiar with but also some new shows before I show you the new shows I just want to let you know this has been a long time coming now we start the Young Turks in 2002 we started in my living room with a couple of folks who are still at the network at the time we were a radio show and then at the end of 2005 we went to online video we were actually YouTube's first partner when they started the partner program but we actually had done some version of a cable channel on our own website first now mind you no one came to it okay but we did launch it all the way back in 2005 and and we had this idea and so this is the culmination of that idea but real quick let me tell you about that back in that day at that time we had myself and Ben make was hosting also Jill pike she's not here anymore but she was a wonderful wonderful part of the young turks for a long time and Michael sure would come in so these are all the old-school guys and then behind the scenes was dave koehler who helped set all this up hey soos Godoy who's the director and he's still the director today after all this time after 13 years he's directing the show right now and Jerry Jackson who was our producer who produced today's show still with us after all this time so that core group Ana Kasparian would join us later in it and would grow and grow and grow got together and and for the business side it was mainly Dave and I plugging away on and I was like Dave I think maybe to put it on the website and it will take the Young Turks at the time was three hours and we'll just keep looping it and then it'll be like a cable channel and we did it and you could go to the web site back then and you'd see the show well like I said nobody came we went on YouTube and started to grow it obviously we went to all the different platforms and now we have over 200 million views a month and and a great number of shows and channels and networks and platforms but today in 2018 to be able to actually give you a 24-hour channel with all different programming every single day so much of it is live it's just a great great moment for us at TYT and super happy to launch it with YouTube TV and on YouTube TV by the way you get all the TV channels you're familiar with to ESPN Bravo CNN MSNBC Fox etcetera and now TYT and some we're among
