1
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:10,955
>> President Trump: THANK YOU

2
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:12,756
AS WELL TO OUR DEPUTY ATTORNEY

3
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:14,959
GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN FOR BEING

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,392
HERE.

5
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:16,560
FLEW DOWN TOGETHER.

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,962
PRESS WANTS TO KNOW, WHY DIDN'T

7
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:20,164
YOU TALK ABOUT IT?

8
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:21,398
WE HAD A VERY GOOD TALKER, I

9
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,567
WILL SAY.

10
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:27,171
IT BECAME A VERY BIG STORY

11
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:27,638
ACTUALLY, FOLKS.

12
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:28,939
WE HAD A GOOD TALK.

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,574
>> Laura: BOY DID THAT KEEP

14
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:31,775
PEOPLE GUESSING.

15
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:32,376
THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP

16
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,378
SURPRISING A LOT OF FOLKS WITH

17
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:36,247
HIS NEW FOUND SUPPORT FOR DEPUTY

18
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:37,548
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN.

19
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:42,286
THE MAN OVERSEEING THE ROBERT RB

20
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:42,319
THE MAN OVERSEEING THE ROBERT RR

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,553
THE MAN OVERSEEING THE ROBERT RT

22
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:45,956
MUELLER PROBE.

23
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:47,358
DEVON NUNEZ IS HERE TONIGHT.

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,360
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

25
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:50,561
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON THE

26
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:54,031
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TODAY?

27
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,367
THAT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING.

28
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,569
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US

29
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,537
THINK THAT ROSENSTEIN SHOULD BE

30
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:00,571
DISMISSED BEFORE THE ELECTION.

31
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:01,972
I THINK HE DOES HAVE TO COME IN

32
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:03,440
THIS WEEK AND ANSWER WHETHER OR

33
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:05,576
NOT HE WAS WILLING TO WEAR A

34
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:06,510
CHOIR OR NOT AND WHETHER OR NOT

35
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,280
HE WAS LOOKING AT INVOKING THE

36
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:10,047
25TH AMENDMENT.

37
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:11,348
THOSE ARE KEY QUESTIONS THAT HE

38
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:12,616
WILL ANSWER BEFORE THE RUSSIA

39
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:13,984
TASK FORCE THIS WEEK SUPPOSEDLY

40
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:19,356
ON THURSDAY.

41
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,058
>> Laura: THE ISSUE OF THIS

42
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:23,761
REDACTED SERIES OF DOCUMENTS

43
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:25,196
REGARDING THE RUSSIA PROBE,

44
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,064
PEOPLE WATCHING ACROSS THE

45
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,767
COUNTRY, SAYING OKAY, YOU GUYS

46
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,569
ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THIS.

47
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,937
DOCUMENTS THAT ARE DECLASSIFIED

48
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,073
OR THEY ARE NOT WERE PARTIALLY

49
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:40,945
DECLASSIFIED.

50
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:42,146
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH

51
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:44,515
A FEW OTHERS FROM THE INTEL

52
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,115
COMMUNITY CONVINCED THE

53
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:48,385
PRESIDENT, CORRECT ME IF I'M

54
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:49,987
WRONG, NOT TO DECLASSIFY

55
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:52,022
DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE FIRES OUT

56
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:54,058
WARRANT AGAINST CARTER PAGE AND

57
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:55,759
OTHERS.

58
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,162
AND IT KICKED IT OVER TO THE

59
00:01:58,163 --> 00:01:58,662
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

60
00:01:58,663 --> 00:01:58,996
CORRECT?

61
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:01,632
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

62
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,368
>> THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT'S

63
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,738
REALLY MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH

64
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,941
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE FBI.

65
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:12,576
EVERY TIME I TRY TO GET

66
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:14,712
SOMETHING OUT OF THE PUBLIC,

67
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:15,779
THEY CRY WOLF.

68
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,214
THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY CLEAR AND

69
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,782
SAID THAT THESE DOCUMENTS NEED

70
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:22,119
TO BE IMMEDIATELY DECLASSIFIED,

71
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,356
WITHOUT REDUCTIONS.

72
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,283
THEN SUDDENLY, THE IG WAS

73
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:52,683
BROUGHT IN.

74
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:53,384
NOW MY CHALLENGE WITH AGAINST

75
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,084
THE IG, THE IDEA IS PROBABLY A

76
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:54,785
GREAT GUY BUT WE ARE CONGRESS

77
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:55,452
AND WE BELIEVE PEOPLE HAVE A

78
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:56,186
RIGHT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION.

79
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:56,920
IT NEEDS TO BE MADE PUBLIC, NOT

80
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:57,421
MUCH INFORMATION.

81
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,155
BUT WE WANT THE PRESIDENT TO BE

82
00:02:58,156 --> 00:02:58,889
CLASSIFIED AND THE PRESIDENT HAS

83
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,423
MENTIONED HE WOULD.

84
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:00,157
SO IT'S NOW BEEN TWO AND A HALF

85
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:00,858
OR THREE WEEKS AND IT DOESN'T

86
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:01,325
TAKE THAT LONG.

87
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:02,026
YOU ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT 20

88
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:02,760
PAGES OF FISA AND I THINK ABOUT

89
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:08,098
A DOZEN OR SO OTHER REPORTS, AN

90
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:08,966
AND, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

91
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,335
ARE THINKING HERE.

92
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:14,038
THE PRESIDENT I THINK IT IS A

93
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,239
SMART GUY, AND I THINK HE NEEDS

94
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,340
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO HE

95
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:20,144
LISTENS TO.

96
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:21,845
>> Laura: WHILE ADAM SCHIFF IS

97
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:22,846
ALL OVER THIS AS YOU MIGHT

98
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:23,180
IMAGINE.

99
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:27,184
LET'S WATCH.

100
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:29,586
>> THE SINGLE ACT OF USING A

101
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:31,588
NEVER BEFORE HOUSE RULE TO

102
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:32,589
SELECTIVELY RELEASE CLASSIFIED

103
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:40,764
INFORMATION IN THE NOW NUNEZ

104
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,733
MEMORANDUM, AND IT WAS A

105
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,467
FRAUDULENT ONE AT THAT.

106
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,536
>> HE'S HONESTLY NOT TALKING

107
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,971
ABOUT A PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT,

108
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:49,373
BUT MAKING A PERSONAL ABOUT YOU,

109
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:51,575
YOU KNOW YOU ARE USED TO THIS

110
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:52,443
AND RUNNING FOR REELECTION, AND

111
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:53,177
THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO MAKE

112
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:57,781
YOU OUT BE    TO BE THE BOGEYMAN

113
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:57,815
YOU OUT BE    TO BE THE BOGEYMAH

114
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:57,848
YOU OUT BE    TO BE THE BOGEYMAR

115
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,382
YOU OUT BE    TO BE THE BOGEYMAE

116
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,883
BUT AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS TO ME

117
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:01,785
THAT AMERICANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

118
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:04,021
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY AN

119
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,389
AMERICAN CITIZEN WAS SPIED UPON

120
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,558
USING DOCUMENTS THAT WE ARE

121
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:10,094
CREATED AT THE FUNDING OF THE

122
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,497
PRESIDENT'S OPPONENTS DURING THE

123
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:15,566
CAMPAIGN.

124
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:16,567
>> THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

125
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,167
AND THE FRIENDS OF THE MEDIA

126
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:19,168
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH ALL OF

127
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,407
THEM, EXCEPT FOR 10%, AND ALL

128
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:24,975
THE BAD PEOPLE FROM THE CLINTON

129
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:26,777
ADMINISTRATION WERE FUMBLING

130
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:28,579
THIS STUFF IN THE FBI.

131
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,048
THEY HAVE A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THE

132
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:34,785
FBI AND DOJ THAT ARE GONE.

133
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,153
WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THE AMERICAN

134
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:39,857
PUBLIC KNEW THAT THIS

135
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:40,591
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY

136
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:44,061
WAS DOING TO BASICALLY SET UP A

137
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,929
CAMPAIGN AND ACCUSE THEM OF

138
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,630
POLLUTING WITH RUSSIANS WAS

139
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:51,535
REALLY WRONG.

140
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:52,836
WE ARE PROVING THAT ONLY

141
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,905
COLLISION THAT HAPPENED WAS

142
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:57,341
COLLISION WITH THE DEMOCRATS.

143
00:04:57,342 --> 00:04:59,476
IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THE

144
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:00,577
RUSSIANS.

145
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:03,046
AND I WILL TELL YOU, I STILL

146
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,615
WANT TO KNOW WHY NOBODY IS

147
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:07,718
INVESTIGATING WHAT RUSSIANS

148
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:08,952
WERE, AND THE DEMOCRATS AND THE

149
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:12,189
CLINTON CAMPAIGN WERE TALKING TO

150
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,057
THROUGH FUSION GPS AND FEEDING

151
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:15,592
THAT INFORMATION INTO THE FBI.

152
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:16,994
NOW WE KNOW THAT BROKE LAST WEEK

153
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:19,563
AND YOU KIND OF ALLUDED TO IT

154
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:31,742
EARLIER, AND, I'M SORRY, BUT

155
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:35,913
THAT DOESN'T SMELL GOOD TO ME.

156
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:38,248
>> YOU CAN'T BE HAVING

157
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,082
POLITICAL -- ARE MEETINGS THAT

158
00:05:39,083 --> 00:00:00,000
EVEN HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF
