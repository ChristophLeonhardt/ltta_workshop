1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,940
You probably imagine anonymous internet commenter,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,240
or a shock jockey,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,840
or a partisan hack. You probably

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,750
don't imagine the Senate Majority Leader,
or the Speaker of the House of

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,000
Representatives or the Chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,770
But maybe

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,640
you should, because if the past few
months of batshit political coverage

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,940
have shown us anything...

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,620
"Bombshell accusations", "missing text messages",

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,900
"secret societies",

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,980
"secret memos",

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,157
"one hell of a conspiracy",

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,740
"that does go deeper than Watergate". "Deeper than Watergate?"

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,600
It's that trolling is now the work of

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,100
serious politicians.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,200
We begin tonight
with the unraveling of a conspiracy

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,129
theory - this one was created and promoted
by elected officials on Capitol Hill.

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,629
Trolling has been used to refer to a lot of
different bad behaviors, but at its heart

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,620
it means deliberately provoking someone
in order to bait them into overreacting.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,440
Milo Yiannopoulos does this all the
time.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,980
He says something he knows is

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,480
ridiculous.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,340
and then smiles as the audience freaks out.

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,560
Because I don't want to spend a whole
video talking about Milo, let's use a

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,627
different example.

26
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:04,680
Let's use Charlie Brown.

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,320
What?!

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
Let's just go with me.

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,920
You've watched this scene a million times, right?

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,760
Lucy promises to let Charlie Brown kick

31
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,060
the ball, Charlie tries to kick it, she
pulls it away and he falls flat on his ass.

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,660
This scene is basically trolling 101.

33
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,580
The troll baits their target "I'll hold

34
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,760
the ball and you kick it". The target gives
the desired reaction,

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,720
"this time I'm gonna kick that football clear to the moon."

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,780
And then the truth is revealed

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,120
the troll was just leading
them on.

38
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,260
"what does this have to do -"

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,979
"I'm getting there!"

40
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,280
So how would this formula work if you're
trying to troll a major news network?

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,660
First you'd need the bait.

42
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,460
Promise reporters you have some big bombshell

43
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,200
they have to pay attention to.

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,390
"Republican lawmakers claiming they have

45
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,340
documents, classified memos, secret memos,
to prove widespread abuse by the FBI".

46
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,440
"What I read it is as bad as I thought it
was. The entire Mueller investigation is a lie."

47
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,020
Then you get a reaction: days of
wall-to-wall news coverage about what

48
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,100
might be in your super secret memo.

49
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,750
"The secret memo at the center of an

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,020
extraordinary plan. We don't know what's
in the memo. As a journalist I want to

51
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,630
see what's in the memo. Should that be
released to the public? Have you

52
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,180
decided if you'll release the memo? Why not allow people to look at it?

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,520
You've read the memo? I read the memo.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,640
And? Well obviously I can't tell you what's
in the memo.

55
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,700
So I can't discuss what was

56
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,880
in the memo, but I can tell you the
American people need to see it." And then

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,940
the reveal: your big bombshell turns out
to be a dud.

58
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,930
"The memo has now been

59
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,569
released, this memo is a dud, a complete
dud. It doesn't say anything it calls

60
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:34,069
into question the wider Mueller probe. It
over-promised and under-delivered, the

61
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,819
revelation is precisely the opposite of
what they wanted to reveal." And news

62
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,760
networks have to explain to their
viewers that the scandal they've been

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,020
following for days, was actually nothing.

64
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,450
"They build it up, they build it up,

65
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,360
and then it's about nothing."

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,920
"This is what all the hype was about?"

67
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,760
Now at first glance this story has a happy
ending, right? The truth eventually came out.

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,980
But if you view this story as a
giant troll, it looks very different.

69
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,940
News networks spent days telling audiences
that a huge scandal could be brewing.

70
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,910
Millions of people read headlines about
the FBI potentially being corrupt and

71
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,390
Republicans got to go on TV and tell their
supporters that they're right to be

72
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,280
suspicious of the Mueller investigation.

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,170
"I'm good with a memo coming out because

74
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,700
it exposes the FBI coming after a
political opponent.

75
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,500
Uh, okay it's not an answer to my question."

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,400
The beauty of trolling is that the truth

77
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
doesn't actually matter.

78
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,880
When Lucy says

79
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,260
"This time you can trust me. See? Here's a signed document."

80
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,180
She knows she's lying. And she knows she's going to get caught lying.

81
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,300
When Charlie tries to kick the ball she is
literally fact-checking her, but the

82
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,810
point isn't to be honest. It's to provoke
a response, to get Charlie to try and

83
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,780
kick or in the case of the Nunes memo, to
get the media to overreact.

84
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,460
"The juice better be worth the squeeze on this one,
this is like six news cycles now.

85
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,544
"Well I'm excited to find out what's in the
memo"

86
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:49,820
And though we typically think of

87
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,840
trolling as something people do for fun,
in politics it has way scarier

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,530
consequences. For one it's a great way to
distract the news cycle

89
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,320
away from serious stories.

90
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,970
The same week that Nunes started talking about the memo,

91
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,750
the New York Times reported that Trump
had seriously considered firing Mueller.

92
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,640
Look at which story dominated cable news
chyrons.

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,830
But it's not just a focus

94
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,340
problem, this kind of trolling works
because audiences remember negative

95
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,800
information even when it's been debunked.

96
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,630
Political scientist Emily Thorson ran

97
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,839
an experiment where people were exposed
to a piece of negative political

98
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,710
information and then saw a correction.
And she found that people's attitudes

99
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,840
towards the target of the lie got worse
even after the lie was debunked.

100
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,560
She calls this "belief echoes" and that's when
people are given a full clear correction.

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,490
Most casual news consumers won't get
that or if they do, they'll see headlines

102
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,660
like this.

103
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,200
"Republicans released secret
memo accusing investigators of bias."

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,855
"Memo released alleging FBI cover-up."

105
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:45,640
Or chyrons like this.

106
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,440
"Memo says FBI abused surveillance power."

107
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,470
Even after the lie is
revealed, it's repeated in news coverage.

108
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,819
The result is a news environment that
incentivizes bad faith, that rewards

109
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,690
politicians who are willing to commit to
a lie. And so you've seen more and more

110
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,180
pseudo scandals following the same
formula.

111
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,980
There's the bait, missing text messages,

112
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,000
a secret society in the FBI,

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
"it's one hell of a conspiracy and people

114
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,870
at the top levels of our government were
involved in it. A secret society, there's

115
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,950
anything more about that? No, we have to
dig into it. That's that's this is not a

116
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,100
distraction."

117
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,960
There's the reaction.

118
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,550
"The startling allegations of a secret

119
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,920
society, is there any basis to that claim?
Is there a secret society?

120
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,380
Those things are troubling."

121
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,920
And eventually there's the reveal.

122
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,770
"Republican lawmakers are left
empty-handed, when the texts are found

123
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,200
and the secret society is revealed to be
a joke."

124
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,360
On their own, none of these

125
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
stories hold water but together, they
help sow doubt in the minds of voters.

126
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
Help build a vague but persistent belief
echo.

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,560
are we seriously still talking about the secret society Ben?

128
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,300
Which helps explain why so many Republican voters

129
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,060
are now suspicious of the FBI.

130
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,230
A trend that's gotten worse over the past year.

131
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,680
Unsurprisingly, Nunes is already
promising to release more memos in the future.

132
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,860
"He told Brett Baier tonight that
more memos are coming, stay tuned. Tick-tock."

133
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,110
And the sad thing is he'll
probably generate the same media circus

134
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,960
when he does.

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,140
What politicians say is
newsworthy.

136
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,960
"I'm shocked to read exactly what has taken place."

137
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,650
Networks can't just ignore
them, the way that we might block an

138
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,100
internet troll. And what makes trolling
in politics so effective is that it's

139
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,840
almost impossible to prove while it's
happening.

140
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
Charlie could never be sure if

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,620
Lucy is gonna yank the ball away.

142
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,690
The audience can never really know if Milo

143
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,780
means what he's saying,

144
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,260
and journalists can't know if the next Nunes memo is

145
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,720
actually a bombshell until he releases
it.

146
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,760
But what they can do is practice more

147
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,960
restraint, to treat these stories not as
potential bombshells, but as potential

148
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,950
bait and to be aware of the way that
their coverage might be playing into the

149
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,920
hands of a troll.

150
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Charlie may never be
able to resist trying to kick the ball,

151
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,960
but if he holds back a little bit, if he
avoids kicking quite, so hard he can at

152
00:06:50,960 --> 00:00:00,000
least avoid falling flat on his ass.
