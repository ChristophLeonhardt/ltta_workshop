what part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your face do you like the</font>

80
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,320
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh and I write without something I</font>

81
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,510
can't like my face like not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way</font>

82
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,590
that's like I think it's better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

83
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,690
anybody else's but it's my face I like

84
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,370
it I sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I'm jealous of</font>

85
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,960
somebody or majesta so he's wearing or

86
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,700
that like the fact they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> skinny</font>

87
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">or they have like a really nice body and</font>

88
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">they just look better in stuff than me I</font>

89
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,070
go do I want their face though and I go

90
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,010
now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bitchy but</font>

91
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,950
genuinely I like my face not because I

92
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,210
think it's prettier than anybody else's

93
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,540
or well you know particularly an ugly or

94
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,820
anything but do you see we just SWAT

95
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,580
that fly away<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my breath and that</font>

96
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,700
because it's mine and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm used</font>

97
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,530
to and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think having anybody else's</font>

98
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,210
face would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird so yeah that</font>

99
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,470
kind of makes me feel better if I get

100
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,130
kind of like girl world jealous of

101
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,710
people which you know we all do where is

102
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,910
one place you will never go without

103
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,790
makeup on there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere I wouldn't go</font>

104
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,980
without me I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think although</font>

105
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,060
there's some places I probably never

106
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,340
have gone without makeup on now I've

107
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,180
gone to work without makeup on

108
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,830
definitely capture lectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> work I've</font>

109
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,140
gone to lectures my pajamas so I say

110
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,630
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't wearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any makeup</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

111
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,010
I've never gone clubbing without makeup

112
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,310
how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I probably wouldn't out</font>

113
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,370
choice but if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonny's house and</font>

114
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,690
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing a makeup and someone said</font>

115
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,730
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out clubbing I would</font>

116
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,600
still go because I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dance and I</font>

117
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,300
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should stop me but yeah</font>

118
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,960
there are places but I definitely

119
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,300
preferably preferably wear makeup to

120
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,590
like weddings and going out and yeah but

121
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,540
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time it is fun and if I</font>

122
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,490
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

123
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,200
where is one place you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get without</font>

124
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,829
makeup yeah anywhere that makeup um yeah

125
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,269
if I'm taking UNC lecture is about

126
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,880
makeup it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> all subconscious</font>

127
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,410
and stupid but when I go without<font color="#E5E5E5"> makeup</font>

128
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,330
when I put my glasses on and I've called

129
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,580
like dishevelled like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stayed up</font>

130
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,379
all night doing my dissertation I feel

131
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:33,240
like I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a more one with them</font>

132
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,560
and also if I can was like massive

133
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,870
rainbow eyes and like stuff I was spent

134
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,219
later time on and stuff and then I'm

135
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,229
really sorry I was late I I slept

136
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,639
through my alarm and I'm just so late

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,460
they look at me like you had time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

138
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">make your face into an art attacks I</font>

139
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,310
don't really understand how you weren't

140
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,590
here on time that's like in him thinking

141
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,060
anyway would you rather go without

142
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,650
makeup for a week or let your boyfriend

143
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,409
do your makeup for an entire week I'd

144
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,789
rather go without make up for it sorry

145
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,650
Nathan I would rather go without makeup

146
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,509
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it might actually</font>

147
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,150
just stress him out and I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see him</font>

148
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,620
actually kind of feeling quite bad if

149
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,389
he's let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me like leave the house well</font>

150
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,800
maybe he'd find it funny for a while I

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,940
think he would find it bad if I had to

152
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,110
go somewhere important and he done my

153
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,259
make it really badly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah I just</font>

154
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:17,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I'd rather not my Maker sorry</font>

155
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,370
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing that I probably</font>

156
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't be able to properly live it out</font>

157

165
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,960
quite tired and quite like oh and yeah

166
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,009
