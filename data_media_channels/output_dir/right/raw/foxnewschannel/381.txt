1
00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:02,450
DESPERATE SALVAGE OPERATION.

2
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,686
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:07,589
ANGLE.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,289
AFTER ANOTHER WEEK OF DELAY IN

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,993
THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION SAGA

6
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,394
THE FBI SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT IS

7
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:13,661
IN.

8
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:16,531
IT APPEARS THAT THE DEMOCRATS

9
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:17,498
HAVE LOST ANOTHER ONE.

10
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:22,337
>> WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS AT

11
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,339
THE FBI REPORT DID NOT COOPERATE

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,875
ANY OF THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

13
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:30,345
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

14
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:32,480
>> Laura: EVEN THE UNDECIDED

15
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:33,181
HAMLET FINGER, JEFF FLAKE SAYS

16
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:37,352
THE REPORT DOESN'T SHOW ANY

17
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:38,519
COOPERATION WHILE SUSAN COLLINS

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,120
CALLS IT VERY THOROUGH.

19
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,824
LET ME SAY AGAIN, THE REPORT,

20
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,561
ALL 46 CHANGES A BIT APPARENTLY

21
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:47,795
PRODUCED IS ZERO EVIDENCE TO

22
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:49,864
BACK UP THE ACCUSATION OF HIS

23
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:50,298
ACCUSERS.

24
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:55,536
AS WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT,

25
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:56,137
STRAIGHTFORWARD, FACTUAL

26
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:56,905
REVELATIONS HAVE ZERO INFLUENCE

27
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:00,842
ON DEMOCRATS GOING WILD ACROSS

28
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:01,175
AMERICA.

29
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:01,910
FOR INSTANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY

30
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:06,347
OF VERMONT THEY HELD A CANCELED

31
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:07,048
CLASS, CANCEL BRETT KAVANAUGH

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:07,949
RALLY.

33
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,717
HOW CLEVER.

34
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:10,385
AND BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, AND

35
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:12,387
BEL AIR, MARYLAND, THERE WERE

36
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:14,322
SIMILAR CALLS TO KILL HIS

37
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:14,923
NOMINATION.

38
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:16,357
HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., THE

39
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:17,258
HATE MACHINE WAS RAMPED UP TO

40
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,361
FULL THROTTLE.

41
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:22,463
>> OUR DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN

42
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:25,833
HIJACKED BY THE POWERFUL AND

43
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,436
THEY DON'T PLAN TO SHARE IT.

44
00:01:28,437 --> 00:01:30,405
I AM ANGRY.

45
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:32,373
LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR.

46
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:36,277
I HAVE A PLAN.

47
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,947
>> Laura: BUT -- ISN'T ANGER

48
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,982
MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN BECOMES A

49
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,351
CHANCE?

50
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:45,653
>> WE ARE.

51
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:50,158
ABOUT TWO.

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,558
MARCH!

53
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:52,760
>> WE NEED.

54
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:54,362
>>  >> EVERYONE.

55
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,129
>> EVERYONE.

56
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,133
>> TO PAY ATTENTION!

57
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:00,301
>> Laura: WHO NEEDS CHANCE

58
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,337
THAT RHYME ANYWAY?

59
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,673
WHAT WOULD ANTI-BRETT KAVANAUGH

60
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:08,109
PRO-ABORTION PROTEST BE WITHOUT

61
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,678
A FEW HOLLYWOOD HEAVYWEIGHTS.

62
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,246
MODEL EMILY SHOWED SOME OUTRAGE

63
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:14,115
AND SOME MIDRIFF.

64
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:19,354
COMEDIAN AMY SCHUMER WAS AS

65
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:20,321
USUAL POLITICALLY UNDERSTATED.

66
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,090
>> A VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH IS A

67
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:24,360
BOAT SAYING WOMEN DON'T MATTER.

68
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,729
LET'S SAY TOGETHER.

69
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,730
LET'S FIGHT!

70
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,598
LET'S KEEP SHOWING UP!

71
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,133
>> Laura: THE GOOD THING IS

72
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,035
THAT WHEN SHE WAS ARRESTED SHE

73
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:35,570
ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT ON

74
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:36,270
PRISON GARB'S.

75
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,438
SHE WAS ARTIE WEARING IT.

76
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,143
ALL OVER THE CAPITAL THERE WERE

77
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:43,211
SURVIVORS, COSTING SENATORS

78
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:46,147
UNDECIDED ABOUT HIS NOMINATION.

79
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:47,949
THEY ATTEMPTED AT ONE POINT, YOU

80
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,917
WILL LOVE THIS, TO PULL A JEFF

81
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:52,687
FLAKE AND BULLY SENATORS LIKE

82
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:53,354
JOE MANCHIN AND TO CASTING A

83
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,957
"NO" VOTE.

84
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,191
>> AS A SURVIVOR I DON'T

85
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:57,892
UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN LOOK ME

86
00:02:57,893 --> 00:03:08,136
IN THE EYE.

87
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,738
>> HOW ARE YOU NOT LISTENING TO

88
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:11,305
US?

89
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:11,706
>> I AM.

90
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:12,540
>> ARE YOU?

91
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,342
YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO THIS

92
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:14,709
ELEVATOR.

93
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,844
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE?

94
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:17,745
TELL ME!

95
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:18,379
>> Laura: I LOVE THAT.

96
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,348
STEP BACK.

97
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,150
WHY ARE THEY ALWAYS SAID, LOOK

98
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:22,917
AT ME?

99
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,185
WE SEE YOU, BELIEVE ME WE ARE

100
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:26,721
REVERTING YOUR GAZE.

101
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,723
>> THE HARASSMENT TACTICS.

102
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:31,659
I THINK THEY ARE TOTAL TURNOFF.

103
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,760
AMERICANS JUST DON'T LIKE THE

104
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:33,828
STUFF.

105
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,830
MOST PEOPLE JUST WANT THINGS TO

106
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,132
CALM DOWN.

107
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,333
>> Laura: THE TRACKING POLL

108
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:42,336
HAS A PRESENCE APPROVAL AT 50%.

109
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,137
NOT BAD.

110
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:46,140
A NEW POLL FINDS IT HAD 40%, A

111
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,743
FOUR-POINT GAIN FROM LAST MONTH.

112
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:52,547
EVEN BETTER, THAT SAME POLL

113
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:53,548
SHOWS THAT THE SUPERCHARGED

114
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,450
ENTHUSIASM IS ON THE REPUBLICAN

115
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:55,750
SIDE.

116
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:59,554
THE DEMOCRATS ADVANTAGE, TANKED!

117
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:02,457
11 POINTS LAST MONTH, TO JUST

118
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,157
TWO POINTS THIS MONTH.

119
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,692
STILL, THE DEMOCRATS WILL NOT

120
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:08,129
GIVE UP.

121
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,898
>> THE MOST NOTABLE PART OF THIS

122
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,333
REPORT IS WHAT IS NOT     NOT AN

123
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:12,366
REPORT IS WHAT IS NOT     NOT AI

124
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:12,934
REPORT IS WHAT IS NOT     NOT A.

125
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:15,937
AS WE NOTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE,

126
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:18,106
THE FBI DID NOT INTERVIEW BRETT

127
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:18,606
KAVANAUGH.

128
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:22,877
NOR DID THE FBI INTERVIEW

129
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:23,244
DR. FORD.

130
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,347
>> GIVEN HOW LIMITED THESE

131
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,049
DOCUMENTS WERE AND HOW LIMITED

132
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,752
THE SCOPE OF THIS INVESTIGATION

133
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:32,954
WAS, WE ARE REITERATING OUR CALL

134
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:37,125
THAT THE DOCUMENTS WITH PROPER

135
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,159
REDACTION BE MADE PUBLIC.

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,595
WHY SHOULDN'T ALL OF AMERICA

137
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:40,895
FACTS?

138
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:43,364
>> Laura: OKAY, I THINK YOU

139
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:44,799
SHOULD HAVE WORN A WHITE SCARF

140
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,333
FOR SURRENDER.

141
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:47,735
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD'VE

142
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:48,769
BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE?

143
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,938
AMERICANS TO HAVE THE FACTS.

144
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:51,672
DEMOCRATS WANTED A WITCH HUNT

145
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:55,009
AND IT FIZZLED OVER A LACK OF

146
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,544
EVIDENCE.

147
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:57,311
THE FACT THAT AMERICANS WILL NOT

148
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:59,213
FOCUS ON ARE THE ONES HE LEFT

149
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,482
FOR THE MOST.

150
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,951
THE ECONOMIC RECORD OF DONALD J.

151
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:06,187
TRUMP.

152
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:07,421
JOBLESS CLAIMS HAVE DROPPED TO A

153
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:08,723
49 YEAR LOW.

154
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,992
WE NOW HAVE 4.2% GDP GROWTH WITH

155
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:15,296
PROJECTIONS NOW TO MATCH THAT IN

156
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:16,898
THE UPCOMING QUARTER.

157
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,598
MANUFACTURING JOBS -- BUT

158
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:18,699
REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID

159
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,767
THEY WERE NEVER COMING BACK?

160
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:20,735
THEY ARE GROWING AT THE FASTEST

161
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:24,605
RATE IN 23 YEARS.

162
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:25,306
TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY IS

163
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,707
ACTUALLY OFFERING SOMETHING

164
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,544
CALLED RESULTS.

165
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,145
ALSO ONE FOREIGN POLICY, TRADE,

166
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,014
THE AGENDA THAT PEOPLE VOTED

167
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:33,281
FOR.

168
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,516
MEANWHILE, THE DEMOCRATS OFFER

169
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:38,719
AMERICANS ONLY THIS.

170
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,820
>> WHY AREN'T YOU BRAVE ENOUGH

171
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:43,925
TO TALK TO US?

172
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,394
>> DON'T YOU WAVE YOUR HAND AT

173
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:46,661
ME.

174
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:52,700
I WAVE MY HAND AT YOU.

175
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:53,834
>> HOW DARE YOU TALK TO WOMEN

176
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:58,739
THAT WAY.

177
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,242
>> SENATOR, DO YOU BELIEVE

178
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:01,542
WOMAN?

179
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:02,210
>> Laura: IS IT OVER YET?

180
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,878
THERE WE GO.

181
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,747
THE DOOR HAS CLOSED.

182
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,950
DEMOCRATS ARE STILL HOWLING OR

183
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,118
SCREECHING, YOU JUST HEARD THAT.

184
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,354
AGAIN, NONE OF THIS IS A

185
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:13,854
GOVERNING AGENDA.

186
00:06:13,855 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS JUST MORE CHAOS,
