“You don’t have the
answer to the questions,
where did you come from?
What is life all about?
Where are you
going when you die?
You don’t have
those answers yet.
You can find it tonight.”
Billy Graham is probably the
most important evangelist
of the 20th century, even
though American history
is populated with prominent
Christian preachers who were
pivotal figures in their times.
But Billy Graham combined
his personal magnetism
and his clear message
with the foresight
to make use of modern
communications technologies.
Everything from
television to satellite
uplinks to the internet.
“— of God’s mighty love.
When I go abroad, I don’t go
as an ambassador of the United
States, I go as an ambassador
of the king of kings and Lord
of Lords.”
Billy Graham pioneered
global crusades,
and his sermons were
transmitted simultaneously
into dozens of languages —
“Be repentant of
your sins before.”
— and transmitted by satellite
to hundreds of countries.
So he had a global reach.
“Christianity is not a
white man’s religion,
and don’t let anybody ever tell
you that it’s white or black.
Christ belongs to all people.”
Billy Graham was not only
charismatic and telegenic,
but he understood that no
matter how large the crowd,
he had to move each man
and woman there personally.
“Is your heart right?”
And he would speak in a
way that was accessible.
“— be Lord of your eyes,
Lord of your ears —”
People who attended
Billy Graham crusades
would often say
afterward, I felt like he
was speaking to me personally.
“I’m going to ask you to get
up from your seat if you —”
Thousands of people,
many first-time converts,
would stream forward and
be met by representatives
of local churches, so that
after the crusade was over,
they would have a local
church to be part of.
And in this way, Billy
Graham had a huge impact
on building evangelical
Christianity.
“The spirit at large comes
to live within you —”
He wasn’t building just his
own movement or his own church.
He was building Christianity.
“I’m looking forward
to that day when
I’ll see Christ face to face.
Are you?”
