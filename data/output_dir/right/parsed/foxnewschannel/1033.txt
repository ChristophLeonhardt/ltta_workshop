FORECASTERS SAY 80% CHANCE OF
MORE RAIN TONIGHT.
JUST THAT THEY DON'T NEED.
>> SOUTH CAROLINIANS HEAD TO THE
POLLS TO FACE THE TUESDAY
PRIMARY.
IF THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION,
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT SHY ABOUT
WHO HE FEELS IS BEST FIT.
HENRY McMASTER LOVES THE
PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND WAS
WITH ME FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
GREAT FOR MILITARY AND OUR
VETERANS.
HE'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB AS
GOVERNOR AND HAS MY FULL
ENDORSEMENT AIRED A SPECIAL GUY
ON TUESDAY.
McMASTER JOINS US NOW LIVE,
SIR.
THAT IS A NICE ENDORSEMENT I
MUST SAY.
AND YOU ARE OF IF NOT THE FIRST
STATEWIDE ELECTED OFFICIALS TO
ENDORSE THE PRESIDENT IN 2016.
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU GOING INTO
THE PRIMARIES ON TUESDAY?
>> WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT
I'M JUST THRILLED TO HAVE THE
PRESIDENT ENDORSED THEM.
OF COURSE HE CAME DOWN AND HAD A
BIG RALLY AND FUNDRAISER IN A
SOBER AND NOW HE'S TREATED
AGAIN.
I'VE BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE A
NUMBER OF TIMES.
MOST RECENTLY WHEN WE SENT THE
TROOPS TO THE MEXICAN BORDER AT
HIS REQUEST.
I THINK HE'S GOING TO END UP
BEING ONE OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS
WE'VE EVER HAD.
NO DOUBT HE'S CHANGING THE
WORLD.
THE COUNTRY IS BOOMING IS SO A
SOUTH CAROLINA AND MUCH OF THAT
IS BECAUSE OF ONE MAN, DONALD
TRUMP.
ELIZABETH: WILL BE HONEST,
LOOKING AT STATEWIDE POLLING AND
JOHN WARREN IS GAINING THE LEAD
IN HIS OUTSIDER SPEAKING OF THE
CAMPAIGN MESSAGE THAT WORKS, THE
OUTSIDER, THE BUSINESSMAN.
>> YEAH, IT DOES.
I'VE BEEN ELECTED OFFICE FOR
ALMOST 12 YEARS NOW.
I'VE SEEN CHANGES IN SOUTH
CAROLINA AND I'VE GOT
LEGISLATION PASSED TO CHANGE
THINGS AND HELP ANYTHING SAFER.
I DO NOT CANDIDATE RUNNING ON
EITHER PARTY THAT HAS EXPERIENCE
IN MONTFORT MADE.
I WORKED IN EDUCATION AS WELL.
THE WAY I SEE IT AS ECONOMIC
GROWTH AND PROSPERITY, ONE FOR
ITS BEEN A GOOD EDUCATION ARE
THE SAME THINGS THE PRESIDENT IS
FOR.
WE WANT TO PUT LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS IN EVERY SCHOOL TO KEEP
THE SHOOTERS OUT.
HE'S IN FAVOR OF THAT.
WE ARE DOING THINGS HERE.
I'M DOING THE THINGS HE'S DOING
THERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
JUST IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN IN
OFFICE, I DO NOT EXPLODE IN
DOLLARS IN NEW INVESTMENT AND
20,000 NEW JOBS.
THAT'S THE BEST RECORD WE'VE
EVER HAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND A
PART OF THAT OF COURSE IS DUE TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
ELIZABETH: THAT BEING SAID CAN
ASSERT THAT ONE OF THE MOST
CONSERVATIVE DISTRICTS IN THE
NATION.
WHAT IS SEPARATING YOU FROM THE
CANDIDATE?
SOUTH CURLIN AND CARE ABOUT
IMMIGRATION AND WANT TO TALK TAX
REFORM THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE
BUILDING BEHIND ME.
HOW ARE YOU SEPARATING YOURSELF?
>> I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.
LELAND: HOW ARE YOU SEPARATING
YOURSELF FROM OTHER CANDIDATES?
>> I'M THE ONE THAT HAS THE
RECORD.
RONALD REAGAN'S FIRST UNITED
STATES ATTORNEY PROSECUTED
ASPECTS IN VOTER FRAUD AND ALSO
DRUG SMUGGLERS COME TO SEND TO
JAIL AS ATTORNEY GENERAL.
ONE AFTER CRIMINAL DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE.
JUST IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN
GOVERNOR, AS I'VE SAID, WE'VE
WORKED HARD WITH A NEW KIND OF
PROSPERITY JOINING THE
BRAINPOWER OF RESEARCH
UNIVERSITIES OF THEIR GREAT
TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM WITH
THESE FANTASTIC COMPANIES COMING
HERE AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED AS THEY
SAY THAT 6 BILLION IN INVESTMENT
AND 20,000 NEW AND WE'RE
SUPERCHARGING THAT RIGHT NOW.
>> I WANT OUR VIEWERS TO GET A
TASTE OF THE CAMPAIGN
COMMERCIALS WE SEE DOWN SOUTH
AND GET YOUR REACTION.
TAKE A LISTEN, SIR.
>> WE ARE UNAFRAID TO TAKE A
STAND ON WHAT IS RIGHT.
WE LOVE GOD AND WE LOVE YOU.
>> SOUTH CAROLINA IS THE MOST
CONSERVATIVE STATE IN AMERICA.
BUT OUR CURRENT POLITICIANS
CONSTANTLY INCREASE SPENDING AND
THEN COVER THEIR CORRUPT, YOU
KNOW WHY.
>> IT SEEMS AS IF EVERYONE IS
STRIVING TO BE MORE
CONSERVATIVE.
I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT IT'S
GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHEN
VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS ON
TUESDAY AND COULD THIS GO TO A
RUNOFF AS IT OFTEN DOES IN SOUTH
CAROLINA?
IT SHOULD.
WE WILL WIN THE PRIMARY AND IF
WE DON'T WIN THAT, WE WILL WIN
THE RUNOFF AND THEN WIN THE
GENERAL ELECTION.
I THINK THE VOTERS IN SOUTH
CAROLINA ARE CONSERVATIVE.
I HAVE A CONSERVATIVE RECORD.
I'VE DONE THESE THINGS AND ALSO
DONE THE KIND OF THINGS RESIDENT
TRUMP IS DOING.
HE'S THE REASON THIS COUNTRY IS
FLOURISHING AND WE WANT TO KEEP
THAT GOING AND WHEN YOU WIN LIKE
WE WIN HERE WITH 6 BILLION IN
CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND 20,000
NEW JOBS IN A RECORD.
COMMENT YOU DON'T HIRE THE
EXPERIENCE COACH.
YOU GIVE BACK COACH MORE YEARS
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING
PEOPLE TO DO.
>> A BOOK ON TUESDAY.
KEEP YOU POSTED.
