so Hillary Clinton thinks religious discrimination is bad on Thursday the New York Times ran a report on Muslim parents living in fear of Donald Trump I had a scary dream about Donald Trump screamed the headline real headline Muslim parents faced a tense election here's a segment of the amazing hit piece is a quote from the New York Times it was the morning after the second presidential debate which the El Charro family's two youngest daughters watched in the basement of their Staten Island home with their parents in the middle of the night Maria went to her parents from twice unable to sleep and walked to the living room and checked her family security camera that morning mr. al char 52 asked his daughter what she saw in the nightmare quote he was so mean to us she said he has scary face like a zombie or something in the dream Maria said later mr. Trump came to the home of every Muslim family in the country and put each one in jail don't worry he told his daughter confront comforting her he's just talk he tried to sound convincing but her nightmare unsettled him this is really before Halloween in the New York Times the piece linked violence against Muslims to Trump of course 2015 featured 260 hate crimes according to the FBI against Muslims this was apparently a huge uptick but still way lower than 647 instances targeting Jews who constituted nearly 57 percent of all hate crime victims Hillary of course responded to the New York Times piece with alacrity on Twitter she said this is heartbreaking no child in America should feel afraid to practice their religion or embrace their heritage well that's fine talk from the same lady who once proclaimed that anyone who did not comply with her views on social leftism ought to give up their religion in 2015 she said quote far too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth laws have to be backed up with the resources and political will and deep-seated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed so much from bracing our heritage if you won't bake a gay a cake for a gay wedding time to give up Jesus like right now Hillary is also the same woman whose campaign director John Podesta received an email from sandy Newman of voices from progress that calls Catholicism quote a Middle Ages dictatorship in need of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church Podesta issued no challenge to such bigotry religious Americans across the country hold our breaths thanks to Hillary Clinton the Democratic Party seeks to quash religious nonprofits religious day schools even nunneries that don't comply with its wishes on everything from abortion to contraception to same-sex marriage Hillary doesn't get to pretend to defend religion while paving the way for its destruction i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show yes yes it seems so much good okay so I am so excited people the FBI has now reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails I'm not

gonna have on dana perino in just about 20 minutes here we'll talk about it we'll talk with her about her new book let me tell you about Jasper which is gonna hit the New York Times bestseller list I have no doubt and we'll also be deconstructing the culture a little bit later and there's so much to talk about just general but but the big news of the day is that the FBI has now dropped a bombshell bombshell doesn't really describe properly a nuclear warhead on to the Clinton campaign this is amazing he sent a letter to a congressional committee chairman here is the text of the letter dear mr. chairman in previous congressional testimony I referred to the facts that the FBI had completed its investigation of former secretary Clinton's personal email server due to recent developments I am writing to supplement my previous testimony in connection with an unrelated case the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation I'm writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and I agreed the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work I believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony so Comey doesn't want to be caught out as a perjurer saying there was no evidence that she knew that the private server was exposed to hack or there was no evidence that she did it with extreme carelessness he doesn't want to be caught in a perjury trap and he also doesn't want to be caught in in this particular trap where a bunch of classified emails I revealed that Hillary Clinton knew about and knew were exposed to foreign hack and put on her private server anyway and then he gets in all sorts of trouble because here's sort of the timeline right a few months ago he kills the investigation he says that that Hillary should not be indicted by the Department of Justice and then the next thing that happens is all of these emails start cropping up what he doesn't want is he knows he's gonna have to reopen the investigation in three weeks anyway he's gonna be forced because everybody's gonna know the information and then he'll be accused of being the ultimate political hacker guy who shut down the investigation just in time to get Hillary Clinton elected and then reopened the investigation right after Hillary Clinton was elected so to avoid looking like a political hack that he clearly is he's now going to reopen the investigation and announce it publicly eleven days before the election so I mean this is crazy stuff gang I mean this is the the real reason that James Comey shut it down as everybody knows at this point is that he was attempting he was attempting to protect her for the election he was hoping that that would be the end of it it was not the end of it and now it's exposed that he did it for political reasons and he doesn't want to look SuperDuper political by reopening it after her election so it looked like he shut it down the entire time so he's gonna do it now 11 days beforehand so he can put down his marker and he can say I wasn't political the FBI wasn't political we gave you the information as it became available to us therefore if you elected Hillary in spite of that that's your problem but it has nothing to do with me it is James Comey who is a political hack covering his political ass and it's glorious because now we have two wrongs making a right right this rarely happens in real life two wrongs generally don't make a right in this case they sort of do so he originally killed the investigation with was wrong and now he's reopening the investigation without giving us all the evidence which normally would be kind of wrong except that he never should have shut the investigation in the first place so it's all hilarious it is all funny and watching all of these people on the Left running around today and flipping their opinion on James Comey he went from the great lawgiver the great law bringer the the wonderful man he went from that to political hat partisan working for the Republicans on the Republican side there are some people who are going right now from he was the worst partisan hack ever to honest man Jim's coming I always told you like that James Comey yeah then there's me I say he's corrupt all the way through he's been corrupt since the beginning he's corrupt now this is what we call political ass-covering and fine I don't care the investigation is reopened and now Americans are gonna have to look dead into the face of the actual prospect that the president-elect of the United States if Hillary is elected may be arrested and charged right and what's Obama gonna do pardon her right after she got elected the happiest man by the way in America right now is not Donald Trump who is is certainly happy the happiest man in America is Tim Kaine who's sitting somewhere going my god I could be President in like three weeks here I mean we're in the actual situation where me there's nobody from Virginia who nobody likes and kind of weird I could be President in the United States just because Hillary could get impeached like the day after she's elected or arrested the day after she's elected in boom look at that Tim Kaine to the president wow wow I mean this is nutty nutty stuff folks I have to give credit to my friend Andrew Clavin drew is wrong about a lot of things but he is correct on this he's been saying for months that the other shoe is going to drop right he's been saying on a show for a long time there'd be one more twist in the campaign I assume this is the twist in the campaign if you think this is fun though wait till Monday because I promise you the Democrats have been keeping a bunch of dynamite stored up about Donald Trump in their basement and they were gonna just gonna hold it cuz what's the purpose and now that this is broken they're gonna have to dump every piece of Apple on Donald Trump you've ever not wanted to hear about so the Donald Trump horse sex tape will come out Monday morning courtesy of the DNC I mean that's where this is going every piece of garbage about these two candidates will come out and I am over the moon about all of it because come on I mean if you can't enjoy the circus then why pay for the ticket so now this is a I mean this is just wild stuff so Paul Ryan is already released statement he says that the Director of National Intelligence should suspend all classified briefings for Clinton until this matter is fully resolved well she's gonna be president-elect in like a week and a half if the polls don't shift by the way the polls are shifting in Trump's direction they have been shifting in trumps direction in the Real Clear Politics poll average she was up like seven points two weeks ago that poll average is now down to four point four points in a lot of the swing states it's still very close he still has a long haul to make but my god I mean if he can't capitalize off my opponent is going to go to jail right if he's a little or could go to jail and the FBI just said it I mean this is honest to god I haven't had time to tweet it yet but I'm going to okay this is this is Hans Gruber turning to Theo in die hard and saying Theo you asked for miracles I give you the FBI I mean that's that's where we are at this point okay so the Bob Goodlatte who's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee he's released a statement about the Comey reinvestigation quote the FBI's decision to reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton reinforces what the House Judiciary Committee has been saying for months the more we learn about secretary Clinton's use of a private email server the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security now that the FBI has reopened the matter it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness the American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law again this is what happens when you go political if you're James Comey this is what happens when you sell your soul if you sell your soul it turns out that the devil is gonna be there to collect and the devil is there to collect for James Comey who now is being condemned by both sides of the aisle as a partisan hack the guy who had basically a spotless reputation just about eight months ago has now been tarred and feathered as well he should be and and I find the entire thing absolutely hilarious what's hilarious about it too is that the media was prepping there the media was prepping their approach their approach was going to be there they were doing the same thing in their way the Comey is doing now the media's approach here was going to be Hillary's gonna win anyway now's the time when we criticized her about her corruption this is the game the media play in order to demonstrate that they are that they not corrupt even though they are in order to demonstrate that they're not lefties even though they are what the media do is they wait until the most opportune moment for the Democrat and then they dump all of the all of their criticisms about the Democrat and then later when you say you guys never criticize the Democrats they say no no we did and you say right that's when your Democrat was already winning they said Bob we did we didn't remember we did we reported on it sure it was when the election was basically over already that's when we reported on it so this is the problem for Hillary the last week Democrats assuming she's gonna win have started to have started to criticize Hillary because they assume it's not gonna do any damage and it plays right into the narrative that she's corrupt and then Comey hits them with the bomb and boom Hillary's Rhian die today she's reinvestigation it's amazing stuff so Chris Matthews here was Chris Matthews last night right criticizing Hillary Clinton under the safe assumption she was gonna be elected well I'll make a judge but every time I watch the politician engaged in a certain pattern of behavior go to the White House they continue to engage in that pattern afterwards people don't change because we swear them into the White House they become that person big-time and and the Clintons were raising money like this hand over hand back in and of his back in 1996 using we call it motel 6 they were bringing put hoarding them in pulling them in bye-bye train loads of contributors and then let them sit in the Lincoln Bedroom for a while then charge them by the hour this is what they did before this is what they like you can still vote for Hillary Clinton but remember you're getting this as part of the package because that's been their pattern so Chris Matthews an MSNBC going after her what appears to be as hard as I would they're right his bio cream does and she's amazing at polka Hardman wouldn't say hard but she kind of is I mean not like she's stand on the street corner but it depends on the street corner and she wears hooker outfits and everything I would say say go come over this show the Chris Matthews goes after Hillary really hard there right but he's doing that under the under the assumption she's going to win make truck Todd's does the same thing Chuck Todd comes out yesterday and he's a hack from a method from NBC and Chuck Todd says I don't see how the Clintons can even keep the Clinton Foundation going in the face of all of the new information we got earlier this week about them using the Clinton Foundation basically as a front for them to for them to raise money on the side for Bill Clinton's pocket look at the bottom line there is no way on any circumstance that the Clinton Foundation should have should be operating she becomes president I stole I don't see how they keep that god I just go so he doesn't see how they keep it and you can see the Democrats are trying to cover their butts in the media now and they're doing so by saying okay now what Krim criticize Hillary and that way later when she wins and you say that we were that we were partial for her we can point back to comments like this and say no no no no no no we were critical of Hillary Clinton before the election that's what Comey is doing in his own way as well but now it's all backfired because they've made the case this entire week that she's super corrupt and can't be trusted and then BOOM Comey comes back with we're reopening the investigation into her emails so now what do they do now what do they do because now the election is actually in jeopardy for them and they're making Trump's case they're making the conservative case they're making the Republican case they're making the case against Hillary Clinton they were doing so thinking it was all going to be okay for them and now they did it and they're gonna pay a price because this is gonna hurt her really badly I mean the election is not far enough out this is not far enough out that it's not gonna hurt her in the polling data I mean I'm looking at the polls right now from Real Clear Politics okay here's how close this election still isn't a lot of these states in Florida Clinton is basically in a dead heat with Donald Trump which means he given this sort of thing he probably should in Florida in Ohio Trump is up in Pennsylvania it's a five-point race in New Hampshire it's a six point five point race but in North Carolina Clinton's only up by two point four okay this could shift Carol in North Carolina back into Trump's category in Nevada Clinton's only up by two this could shift Nevada back in the Trump's category in Michigan Clinton's up by six in Wisconsin she's up by six point seven in Colorado she's up by six point two but in none of those states is she running anywhere close to 50% right Trump said like 37 in Michigan he's like 38 in Colorado he's gonna lose Virginia I would assume but there are some states that are in play here for him he still needs to pull Wisconsin or Michigan he still needs to pull some of these states that are a little more outliers but if this really does damage to her it could happen it could happen this is this is an election changing moment or it could be if Donald Trump can demonstrate any sort of discipline right if he can demonstrate any sort of discipline and all he should say from now on is James commis doesn't matter what the question is mr. Trump did you sexually assault 27 different women in a row at a nightclub in 1997 James Comey shouldn't he shouldn't matter nothing that should be the only thing that comes out of his mouth two words that come out of his mouth for the rest of the election cycle James Comey that's it that's all he should say just over and over I've been hypnotized James Comey right said that's that's all and if he does that maybe maybe he has a shot maybe he has a shot because this is wild now as I say do I expect that that Donald Trump will be able to do that no because he hasn't thus far do I expect that the Democrats will drop every piece of oppo they have ever found ever on anything on Donald Trump in the next several minutes yeah I think that's probably what's going to happen but this is I mean this is wild this is wild stuff folks I've never seen anything like it at this entire election is insane and as just an impartial observer of this election since as you know I'm not for either of these candidates this is the most highly amusing election all truths are being revealed by the amount of insanity in this election cycle we're living inside I mean this is it's better than fiction it's better than fiction it really is not better than the fiction book I wrote for allegiance go by it now but it's better than all of the other fiction it really is incredibly out from an election we're gonna we're gonna see Donald Trump in a courtroom screaming at the judge you're corrupt this verdicts corrupt you're all corrupt it's all rigged and here's the thing no matter what Comey says for the next week and a half Trump wins on this issue if Comey says yeah it turns out it was no big deal Trump cuz it was rigged again and then if Comey comes out and he says arrest her and put her in charge gonna say right lock her up it's I mean Donald Trump has to be Kellyanne Conway is over the moon she's tweeting in politic things like we're having a great day in this campaign and this makes it even better right she actually tweeted that that's Kellyanne Conway not Trump so everybody in the Trump campaign is just over the moon also it shifts the the the news in the election cycle away from the fact that Donald Trump has severely under spent what he promised he would spend on his own campaign and has no ground game and is preparing to go to war with everybody and is making as a to play for after the election we don't talk about any of that stuff now because a major part is now under reopened investigation it's it's absolutely hysterical I mean I I just I loved every second of this that

and then you use the promo code Ben okay so I I would love to talk about anything about about other topics today but actually I wouldn't I'd I'd much prefer to talk about this because this is just the greatest thing that ever happened so online everything's exploding and it's happening in real time I mean people are just going nuts over this Hillary Clinton has deplane she waved happily and got into an SUV or she promptly fell down in the back unconscious when they woke her up she just started crying hysterically and shouting who my Abaddon's name Comey is Comey is hidden he hasn't said anything at all Donald Trump by the way announced this at one of his rallies and the supporters started chanting lock her up of course pretty spectacular pretty spectacular stuff and the nice thing is that Trump this is something Trump should be able to do for the next 11 days Trump should be able to just say Hillary's corrupt over and over again because this is the one thing that he's good at right so here is Donald Trump yesterday before this came out saying and this is good Trump right we this is Donald Trump doing the right thing saying Hillary lives the high life at your expense the elites in government like Hillary Clinton believe they're entitled to do whatever they want Hillary Clinton has never earned an honest dollar well I think that's really you know hey let's put it this way what she's done to our country is a disgrace and she should be ashamed of herself she lives the high life at your expense making money off the rig system and it is a rigged system are you starting to agree with me about the rape crisis this is an election between the small handful of people who benefit from the corrupt system and the great majority of American citizens who are the victims of that same corruption those who benefit from the corruption will say and do anything to keep it the way it is they don't want change okay so Trump's whole rigged argument reads a lot better when the FBI is opening and reopening investigations into Hillary for political reasons it is it just it like even Trump's jokes that the media are going nuts about right now they play better because of this news about coming reopening the investigation so for example Trump joked yesterday that everything is so corrupt they should just canceled the election to make him President as part of our plan to bring back American jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35% down to 15% we'll go from the highest to among the lowest Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on small businesses up to 45% what a difference you know what a difference this is and just thank you to myself right now we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump right what do we even have it what are we having her policies is so bad why do we have a big difference okay so he drops that and people go no he's saying we should cancel the election but one of the points that he's been making is the entire system is rigged and now you have the FBI playing footsie with Hillary Clinton back and forth prepping for the election it makes all of the conspiracy nuts sound not so nutty anymore when this sort of game is being played with the federal investigative power it's truly it's truly incredible stuff I mean it's in so you know a lot of the Trump craziness doesn't sound so crazy when when this is happening by the way in terms of the movement for Trump there are a lot of people who are jumping back on the Trump train just in time Mike Pence is making the case that everybody should should come home to Donald Trump that somehow you know it's it's time the time has come you have to come back and it's working it's working what Pence is saying I mean the truth of the matter is there's only two names on that ballot that have a chance to be President of the United States of America and while I'll always respect the right of any man or woman to cast their vote in the manner that they seem best I gotta say to you from my heart I truly do believe a vote for any candidate other than Donald Trump is a vote for a weaker America at home and abroad a vote for any candidate other than Donald Trump is a vote for an America that continues to walk away from our highest ideals of life and liberty and our constitution and a vote for any candidate other than Donald Trump bottom line is about to make Hillary Clinton the 45th president of United States pushing that it's working nikki Haley has now jumped on the bandwagon she's special vote for Trump jason Chaffetz says that he's gonna vote for Trump in Utah so you know it's so the things are coming together for Trump is it's too little too late well you know not a famines comb he has his way that's that's it I'm stories unbelievable well joining us on the line right now is one of the best commentators in American politics at Dana Perino of course you've seen Dana Perino on Fox and you see her on the five all the time and and Dana do we have Dana on the phone being in here hey Dana how are you amazing well I appreciate that thank you so much Dana has a brand new book out it's called let me tell you about Jasper and it's all about her if you've ever spent any time on Twitter her dog is like the biggest thing on Twitter this book is destined for the best outlets it really is a field feel-good book in a not so field good time but Dana obviously before I want to ask some questions about the book but before we get to that I have to ask what you're making okay since you've given me the excuse I promise I'll get I will ask a couple questions about the book but I do want to start by asking I need to start by asking you about the this this Comey announcement that they're basically reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails to me a couple of things are happening one the investigation never should have been closed - this is Comey covering his butt because he knew he was gonna have to reopen it didn't want to wait until after the election to do it because then it would look like he had shut it down for his friend Hillary well why do I think he knew because I think that he actually has seen emails that suggest that he's going to have to reopen it Williams of NBC News apparently just reported that it wasn't enough that they found but a device oh wow which might have email on it now I don't I don't know if that's true but Pete Williams is a pretty solid reporter from the and he works at the Justice Department actually cover the Justice Department since even before I worked there and in 2001 so there might be a natural device there might be even more email that's not her device apparently but maybe what somebody from the campaign right so one of the reasons that people are all over this is because of the timing obviously we wouldn't be talking about this how much of one eleven days prior to the election so Paul Krugman of the New York Times is going nuts he says this means commis a political hack now people on the right are saying well now back back then back when he got rid of the investigation right exactly so now everything has flipped you know my feeling is that what's weird about the piece of the letter that he sent that Comey sent is that he basically said we don't even know what we have yet but I'm just announcing it now and that's why I think what's happening is that he's concerned that it's going to come out later that there actually is invaluable material on this thing and he doesn't want to be accused he doesn't want the FBI to be accused as an institution of having hidden material and hidden information prior to the election to help Hillary Clinton that's probably right and the other thing I think he was facing a little bit of a mutiny from his upper ranks yes exactly several FBI agents saying that they were very unhappy so you would know it and I worked at the Justice Department so maybe I would know but it's unprecedented to me Comey came out in July and gives this whole long list of all the things Hillary Clinton has done wrong and you almost felt like he was leading up to say and that is why we are going to charge her with X or Y right exactly no one could ever case or so we don't recommend an indictment but it is not for the FBI director to it to decide whether there an indictment or not that's for the department to decide right that's why it was so bizarre when he when he said he was going to recommend her to protect the department yeah exactly he was taking these taking the who's falling on the sword for the Loretta Lynch who by the way declared today that she she actually declared the fifth she pled the fifth with regard to visa Ron ransom payment so the whole Obama administration is not appearing in a very good light right now which of course it's insane I mean she's pleading it and not only a cabinet said she's the Attorney General of the United States pleading the Fed she's the chief law enforcement officer in the country what's the crime right exactly you're worried about that weird I mean is it possible I don't know what congressional testimony she'd given on the underground really good I really does fly in the face of government transparency if government officials are not accountable to the public and can actually plead the fifth yeah I mean it's it's a disaster okay so what does this mean for the for the Elector we're talking to Dana Perino her new book is let me tell you about jasper-howe my best friend became America's dog which we got to in a minute but I but I have to ask you then you know we're 11 days from the election Donald Trump has been gaining in in the Real Clear Politics poll average he's within shouting distance if not spitting distance in this election most of the swing states he's still down although several of them are narrow like places like Florida and Ohio do you think that this is enough to shift the election to basically dead heat again running up to the election well maybe like within two points right so she's up about six point opposite points in that average just three points in the Fox poll I'd point out ten points and the NBC Wall Street Journal poll so I think five to six point is probably correct and I would have said that as of noon today now can she get again I'm sorry can Donald Trump then get this to within two or three points yes maybe and that's probably where the country is right and from the polarized electorate question might arise when has an October Surprise ever changed the outcome of an election and I don't know presidential history as well as my co-host on that podcast that I do I'll tell you what with Chris Starr well but I and tell you about 2,000 yep going into 2004 in a couple of polls with the points and about two or three poll Georgia beat with up a couple points so it was really a dead heat and nobody even though he ended up doing so and it goes into a goes to the electoral college and obviously we have the recount takes 36 days but what was it that made me hold your story bullish back from winning outright on that first night it was when there was an October Surprise dropped by the Al Gore campaign that George Bush had had a DUI in his early 20s that he had never revealed ready so it is said in his book urging consequence but about two to three percent of evangelicals decided to stay home and that made all the difference yep I mean so the this this could make a big bridge me to another question which is I have to assume at this point that Hillary has to have some sort of stock of Donald Trump Apple research that she's gonna dump on Monday because time runs short maybe she thought she could live this out but long ago where Hillary Clinton their team put out something about one of the women attacking Trump and and he put out something right after that like an hour later always WikiLeaks probably held something back in the up in the event that they needed to see if they could you know muddy the waters a bit her poll numbers have actually never led her in a national poll but she has been able to widen the gap with him once in August and again in October but each time he's been able to close that gap and just the way that politics works this is like good timing for Donald Trump obviously yeah it's certainly great timing for Trump know that I mean this is a perfect reason I mean there are people on the right who have been saying this for a year is that early voting is a disservice to the voters because obviously new information in the last days of a campaign and this is in I expected when Hillary Clinton drops the the as I said earlier the sex tape of Donald Trump with a horse in three hours that that will probably impact the voting as well so it's every bad piece of information about both these candidates will be will be hanging on the on the clothesline momentarily so it allows them to not have to talk about Trump so this fault for the last weekend before the election that's a great point it's a great point especially because somehow yeah so many people like nikki Haley are jumping on board as I mentioned just before you came on and you're exactly right now they have to talk about Hillary instead of about it's a great great point so it could help them really a lot in these Senate races so Dana one of the things that people have been talking about and they're worried about is let's say that the Donald Trump is not able to to pull this out at the last minute and let's say that he loses because the polls say right now he's going to how does the Republican Party come back together after this is it possible that they come back together after this if Trump is unable to benefit from this new news and he goes on to lose anyway or is this just going to be a constant firefight for the next couple of years I'm electing to predict I don't know I feel like the gloves have been off for this year you've been the target of it yes you know people friends with four years so that you at least were thought you were ideologically aligned with maybe you're no longer speaking to them I have a couple times like that understand that says Hillary Clinton is a great uniter of the Republican Party but if that were true then she would be she would be the one that's down in the polls by five to six points not Trump yeah I think I think that's right so you know post-election yeah do you think that post election I've sort of broken it down into three categories on my end I think that there's there's the the ardent Trump errs there are the people who are conservative and never Trump and then there are the establishment folks and and I think that the establishment folks who some of whom are voting for many of whom are voting for Trump to defeat Hillary some conservatives who are voting Trump to defeat Hillary I think the the question is going to be whether they can come together with the conservative nevertrump or whether the Trump ardent Trump supporters are going to convince the the people who voted for Trump while holding their nose that the never Trump errs were to blame for Trump losing and if and so that the kind of stab in the back method is going to be the great definer of what happens next if people believe that never Trump is responsible for Trump losing then they're gonna be the outcasts and if and if people don't believe that then the people who are sort of the interior Trump group are gonna be treated just like any other losing Republican candidate and they'll sort of fade into the woodwork I think yes I'm actually I think I agree with all that and I'm really interested though on the policy front what happens so there's the blame game that walks but then going forward is it a party that unites to fight for free trade or against free trade is it the party that unites to push for entitlement reform or one that says no we should actually expand entitlement I think it's even deeper than just character flaws you might find in either candidate but in Donald Trump if you don't want to vote for him and you're thinking he's not a conservative he's Conners all the things he's been called Republicans not just Democrats then I don't know how you get back to a policy framework where you can agree upon the Democrats have that they have a flawed candidate but they are united in their policy yeah well we're definitely gonna have to come but the way they became United in their in their policy goals is when they purged the party of any moderates over the past eight years I mean it's it's amazing how they've they've cold there what if they gain a whole bunch of these college-educated right especially you know yeah exactly exactly I don't know what it looks like at the end of two years yeah I agree with you Dana and I think that that's that's one of the things that I've always thought was dangerous about the Trump candidacy is that every growing demographic in the United States is moving significantly out of the Republican column in this election cycle even if Trump were to win that's true so you know white college-educated women are moving dramatically out of the Trump column out of the Republican column Hispanics and blacks are moving out of the Republican column young people are really moving out of the Republican column and that's gonna have some some lasting impact not just for policy on the right but but also for policy on the left if people just buy into the left because they feel the right is so toxic you could actually see a real upsurge in leftism unless the right unites around something that's not so toxic hopefully policies that they work ok sadena i I'm honorbound to ask you about your book now because we've because you know so much time on politics but for all of us who are going to be in a week and a half in two weeks everybody is gonna be burned out on a lot of this stuff and your new book let me tell you about Jasper how my best friend became America's dog is gonna be at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for sure and in what is it what is it can you give people kind of a snapshot of what what you're gonna get from the book I questioned my publisher on the timing of the release of this book I said are you sure by the time we get to there that date which was last Tuesday people are going to want a distraction and a little bit of a lift to remind people I just wanted to share some joy like I got to write a book about my dog I can't believe that I did something a little bit different I added what I think is some excellent modern art I met on Twitter named five hand Photoshop and he takes my dog pictures that I pose and he puts them in all sorts of different hilarious scenes throughout American history our pop culture sports so I feel like it's a book that's accessible for a lot of people not just adults but I also think kids were like in fact megyn kelly told me her little boy takes it to bed with him because I gave them an early copy and you love to look at the pictures when he wakes up in the morning also I'm trying to find a way to remember that we have a lot more and then we might think at the end of this election season part of that is I love for animals and dogs and if you've had a pet and you know what it's like to give them a nickname and to have a best friend when you're feeling blue and also to help them through the end of their life space when they die and that grief that never goes away and there's a there's some common bond that we have because of these animals well the book is let me tell you about Jasper had my best friend become America's dog guest is dana perino so Dana I have to ask question on this I'm not a dog owner I've never been a dog owner and I've had many people trying to convince me to to get a dog for years and years and years and I have a couple of small kids one two and a half and one just under six months and and I figured that if anyone can make the case for owning a dog you probably do it best so so let's get let's hear the pitch I have a saying that every kid needs a dog and every dog needs a kid and not only teaches you responsibility but it softens your heart and I do think that you become a better human being and a better adult if you would grow up with having a dog I think your kids are a little too young right now so you're not gonna have to run out tonight and find a dog but I would say when the kids are around seven and six besides they're gonna be lobbying you for one anyway that's around the time I would get one because they will be better human beings because of it okay that's actually a solid pitch okay so good news I get to wait five years before I have to worry about it but when the time comes then I will then I will definitely I'll definitely be listening to that advice the book is let me tell you about Jasper how my best friend became America's dog the great Dana Perino thanks so much for joining me Shaw I'm sure you're gonna have a busy day and oh I appreciate that's very kind of you so mine is much more depressing than than your book your book is uplifting mine is mine is all death and depression and horror so I really appreciate dana perino thanks so much for joining us really appreciate it hi Ben bye all right stuff so folks again the breaking news today in case you've been living under a rock is that Hillary Clinton the investigation has been reopened by the FBI because what the hell can happen next in this election cycle I don't know do you I'm willing to take I'm willing to take guess I guess is I have no clue I've given up on predicting this thing my predictions in general have been very accurate thus far if I have to give a prediction I don't want to be debbie downer today so I'm not gonna tell you that I think that Donald Trump will find a way to screw this up but yeah I mean just based on breed based on previous history I have a feeling that the media will find some excuse to pick on something that Donald Trump does and then and then flip the script and make it all about Donald Trump if he's disciplined this should help him is he too far behind too late in the campaign my guess is probably yes but it's gonna be it's just the worst of all possible things is gonna happen in this election I'm not sure what that is yet but it will happen that's my that's my main prediction so we have to say goodbye to the folks on Facebook you were really lucky today you got 45 minutes on Facebook gang so Facebook and YouTube but if you want to
