SAYS LAUREL AND YANNY. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT ABOUT? ED: WHO IS IS MAKE MONEY ON THAT. STEVE: I DON'T THINK HE HAS RETURN VIDEO BUT GERALDO RIVERA IS JOINING US LIVE FROM FAIRPORT, NEW YORK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON A BOAT. HI, EVERYBODY, HI, ED, HI STEVE. WELCOME TO THE HISTORIC VILLAGE OF FAIRPORT ON THE INCREDIBLE EERIE CANAL. I SAILED AROUND THE WORLD. I SAILED 1400 MILES UP THE AMAZON RIVER, A BIG ITEM ON MY BUCKET LIST HAS BEEN TO TRAVERSE THE EERIE CANAL, THIS PUBLIC WORKS, INCREDIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN THE COUNTRY, THIS CONNECTED GREAT LIKES THROUGH THE NIAGRA RIVER TO BUFFALO. HUDSON RIVER NEAR ALBANY THE STATE CAPITAL. DOWN TO NEW YORK CITY. IT OPENED UP THE WHOLE COUNTRY, IT UNITED THE COUNTRY. IT USED TO TAKE 2 1/2 WEEKS TO BRING PRODUCE FROM CITY OF CLEVELAND, OHIO, BY OXEN OR HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE. THEY CUT TRAVEL TIME DOWN A THIRD, REDUCED COSTS MORE THAN A HALF. THIS MADE NEW YORK THE EMPIRE STATE. THIS IS WHAT MADE NEW YORK CITY THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. TO GO THROUGH THE ERIE CANAL, WE MONDAY AFTERNOON, SAILED UP TO THE BEGINNING OF THE ERIE CANAL. THANKS TO THE CANAL AUTHORITIES AND THE MAN IN CHARGE OF NAVIGATION, MY OLD BOAT, BELLE, 20 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR, CRAIG AND I TRAVERSED THE ERIE CANAL. WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT THE CANAL, IT HAS TO RAISE BOATS COMING FROM EAST TO WEST ALMOST 600 FEET BECAUSE THE LAKE ERIE IS 600 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL, THE LOCKS WERE DESIGNED, WE WENT THROUGH, THERE WERE SCHOOLCHILDREN CHEERING. SOME OF THE BEST SCENERY IN THE UNITED STATES, CHARMINGVILLE CHARMING VILLAGES ALL THROUGHOUT. ABBY: WE LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON NEWS OF THE DAY, STORY YOU'RE PASSION THAT ABOUT. MEDIA CAUGHT PUSHING A FALSE NARRATIVE. ABOUT A ROUNDTABLE THAT TOOK PLACE A COUPLE DAYS AGO IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAD MAYORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM CALIFORNIA TALKING ABOUT SANCTUARY CITIES AND IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE TRANSCRIPT CAME OUT AND JUMPED THE GUN, REFERRED TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AS ANIMALS, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MS-13 GANG MEMBERS. A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE. THEY JUMPED THE GUN. DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU? YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED, ABBY, LET ME JUST QUICKLY TELL YOU WHAT I WENT THROUGH IN MY OWN MIND. WHEN I FIRST, WE'RE ON THE BOAT, WE'RE NOT WATCHING TELEVISION NEWS OR ANYTHING, BUT I WAS LOOKING AT MY TWITTER FEED. I SAW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD CALLED LATINO IMMIGRANTS SAVAGES. I SAID WHAT THE HELL? I'VE BEEN DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT, MY FRIEND THE PRESIDENT SINCE 2015 AGAINST CHARGES OF RACISM AND THAT REALLY, REALLY HURT MY FEELINGS. IT REALLY CUT ME TO THE QUICK WHEN I HEARD THAT. THEN I SAW SOME OF THE WRITING, SOME OF THE TWEETING THAT DON, JR. DIDS THIS WAS IN CONTEXT AS YOU SAID OF MS-13, THESE VICIOUS GANG BANGERS WHO DECAPITATE PEOPLE, CARVE THEM UP. THIS WAS NOT ABOUT IMMIGRANTS GENERALLY. AND THEN I SPOKE TO SEAN HANNITY ABOUT IT, WE REALLY, REAL HEART TO HEART. I READ THE FULL CONTEXT OF THE REMARKS. THERE IS NO DOUBT, THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO ONE OF THE MOST RUTHLESS AND VIOLENT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTRY, MS-13, THIS SALVADORAN-BASED GANG THAT IS A NATIONAL CRIMINAL SYNDICATE NOW. SO ALTHOUGH I STILL CAUTION AGAINST USING WORDS LIKE SAVAGES AND ANIMALS, ANIMALS I SHOULD HAVE SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING AND THUGS, I THINK WHEN THESE THINGS HAVE POSSIBLE RACIAL CONNOTATION SHOULD PROBABLY STAY AWAY FROM HOT BUTTON WORDS. THERE IS NO DOUBT I'M SORRY. JUST GOING TO SAY NO DOUBT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS GENERALLY. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DESERVE THAT MONIKER. ABBY: I WAS GOING TO SAY TO YOUR POINT, WHY NOT READ THE FULL TRANSCRIPT TO MAKE SURE WHAT YOU'RE REPORT SOMETHING ACCURATE? WHY IS THE MEDIA SO QUICK TO JUMP. LOOK AT PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST WAY THEY ARE COVERED, SEEMS LIKE A HOT QUICKER TO JUMP ON PRESIDENT TRUMP THAN THEY ARE ON PRESIDENTS BEFORE THIS? THERE IS NO DOUBT, THIS PRESIDENT, MAYBE WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF RICHARD NIXON OR ANDREW JOHNSON IN 19th CENTURY, THIS PRESIDENT GETS THE WORSE PRESS OF ANY PUBLIC OFFICIAL I HAVE EVER KNOWN. EVERYTHING HE SAYS, THIS IS CLASSIC EXAMPLE, ABBY, EVERYTHING HE SAID IS CONSTRUED IN MOST EVIL WAY POSSIBLE. EVEN DONALD TRUMP DESERVES FAIRNESS FROM YOU PEOPLE. AND, IT IS DIVISIVE FOR THE COUNTRY IT MISCONSTRUE HIS REMARKS INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE ANY, ANY PERSON WITH HALF A BRAIN READING THE FULL PARAGRAPH RATHER THAN INFLAMMATORY SENTENCE THAN EVERYBODY BROADCAST. SEE THE MESSAGE HE WAS TRYING TO CONVEY. HE WAS SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY. MOREOVER, ONCE THEY'RE HERE THEY ARE DOING THE WORST POSSIBLE THINGS POSSIBLE. THEY DO NOT REFLECT, I MAINTAIN, AND I WILL GO TO MY GRAVE SAYING THEY DO NOT REFLECT THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY GENERALLY. NO DOUBT THESE ARE VERY BAD ACTORS. THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT TO CALL THEM OUT AND TO ANNOUNCE HIS PRIORITY TO PURGE MS-13 FROM THE UNITED STATES. BACK TO YOU GUYS. STEVE: THAT'S RIGHT. WE DID A STORY A WEEK OR TWO AGO ABOUT FROM THE MRC. THEY HAVE LOOKED AT THE PRESIDENT'S COVERAGE IN THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS. 91% OF IT HAS BEEN NEGATIVE, YET, GERALDO, REAL QUICKLY, HIS POLL NUMBERS ARE GOING UP? YOU KNOW WHY, STEVE? IT IS BECAUSE SPECIFICALLY YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE THEIR OWN JUDGMENTS. THEY'RE GOING AROUND THE MESSENGER TO THE ACTUAL NEWS. THEY'RE GOING AROUND THE MESSENGER TO EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS ACCOMPLISHING. IF YOU DIVORCE YOURSELF FROM THE RHETORIC AND SHRILL LANGUAGE, HE IS REALLY HAVING A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENCY. I WANTED TO AVOID THESE KINDS OF
