>>  IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS KEEP
PROMISING OR HOPING FOR A BLUE
WAVE IN 2018.
WITH THAT WE'RE BACK WITH OUR
TALK RADIO PANEL.
TOM OUT IN OREGON AND RJ IN
PENNSYLVANIA.
THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND.
TOM, TO YOU, HAD LUNCH YESTERDAY
WITH A VERY SENIOR DEMOCRATIC
FUNDRAISER WHO TOLD ME THAT
THEY'RE NOW THINKING THIS
DEMOCRATIC BLUE WAVE MAY BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A BLUE
RIPPLE.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
>> I THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATS
FACE SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES.
YOU'VE GOT THE COCH BROTHERS
DROPPING 400 MILLION IN THIS
ELECTION AND IN ADDITION GROUPS
LIKE AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY
THAT THEY CONTROL.
THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
INTERVENING IN A BIG WAY IN A
NUMBER OF THESE CASES IN A
NUMBER OF RACES.
ON LEFT, THERE ARE NO BIG MONEY
SOURCES, IT'S MOSTLY CROWD
SOURCED.
LELAND: OKAY.
>> IT'S A CHALLENGE.
LELAND: WE'VE GOT THE MONEY
ISSUE, MIND YOU, THE FUNDRAISER
SAYS HE'S GOT MORE MONEY THAN HE
KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THE WHAT'S
STRUGGLING IS THE MESSAGE.
AND LISTEN TO CONOR LAMB WHO
SAID THIS IN PENNSYLVANIA.
>> I DON'T SUPPORT NANCY PELOSI,
THE REAL ISSUES ARE THE ONES
THAT AFFECT YOUR LIVES.
LELAND: WHAT DOES IT SAY THAT
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WINNING THE
SPECIAL ELECTIONS ARE DOING IT
BY REPUDIATING THE DEMOCRATIC
LEADERSHIP THAT DEMOCRATS ARE
DOUBLING DOWN ON?
>> WELL, TO THE BEST OF MY
KNOWLEDGE, CONOR LAMB IS THE
ONLY PERSON WHO SAID THAT AND HE
WAS SAYING THAT IN RESPONSE TO A
WHOLE SERIES OF TELEVISION ADS
BEING FUNDED BY OUT OF STATE
BILLIONAIRES THAT SAID THAT, YOU
KNOW, IF HE GOT INTO OFFICE HE
WOULD BASICALLY BE NANCY
PELOSI'S, YOU KNOW, BOY.
AND HE WAS JUST REBUTTING THAT
AND YOU KNOW, TO THE EXTENT THAT
THEY'RE DEMONIZING HER, YOU
KNOW, PARTICULARLY IN
CONSERVATIVE AREAS, THIS IDEA
THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE IN
POLITICS, WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE IN
BUSINESS, YOU KNOW, RESONATES
WITH A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
>> COME ON.
>> SO, IT'S A CHALLENGE, HE'S
PUSHING BACK, BUT BROADLY
SPEAKING.
LELAND: HOLD ON, RJ, THAT SEEMS
LIKE AN AWFULLY BIG CHASM--
>> LOOK HOW MANY ARE VOTED IN AS
REPUBLICANS--
>> WE DON'T WANT WOMEN IN
POLITICS?
WHERE DO YOU GET THIS MANUAL?
>> I REMEMBER THE WAY YOU WENT
AFTER HILLARY.
>> AND THREE IN SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND MEDICARE AND YOU'LL
HAVE THE COMPLETE LIST OF
DEMOCRATIC THINGS, SOCIAL
SECURITY.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOTHING TO
MAKE THIS BETTER.
GIVE THREE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE
SAID OR PROPOSED OR DONE THAT
MADE LIFE BETTER IN AMERICA?
THEY'RE NOT THERE, THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOSE.
>> DEMOCRATS BROUGHT US SOCIAL
SECURITY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND
THE REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW
TRYING TO DESTROY THOSE.
>> HOW MANY YEARS AGO.
>> COME ON.
>> THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A 400
BILLION CUT TO MEDICARE.
THEY CUT MEDICARE, AND CUTS
MONEY OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY.
>> THIS IS A BROKEN RECORD.
YOU GUYS BRING THIS OUT EVERY
TIME, AND IT'S NONSENSE.
>> AND REPUBLICANS HATED SOCIAL
SECURITY SINCE IT WAS CREATED IN
1935.
>> GIVE ME THREE THINGS THAT
DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE TO MAKE
AMERICA BETTER, WHAT ARE THE
THREE THINGS.
LELAND: TOM, 15 SECONDS.
>> WHAT ARE THEY PROPOSING.
>> SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE,
MEDICAID, DECENT TRADE POLICY.
LELAND: ALL OF WHICH ARE NOW
BANKRUPT OR GOING BANKRUPT.
WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.
GENTLEMEN, APPRECIATE IT.
AND WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE ABOUT
