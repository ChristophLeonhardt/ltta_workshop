YouTube is stepping into the ring in the fight against fake news but it's choice of sparring-partner has drawn a barrage of criticism YouTube conspiracy videos science fiction for people who don't understand they're watching science fiction YouTube faces strong criticism after to spread conspiracy theories in the aftermath of the deadly school shooting in Florida YouTube took down the video but this isn't the first time they have been unable to or unwilling to stop the spread of conspiracy theories what makes this whole thing sort of fascinating and problematic though of course is that you know who's to decide what is misinformation you know in in 2003 before the invasion of Iraq as far as the establishment was concerned it was a conspiracy theory to say that there were actually no weapons of mass destruction and that the invasion of Iraq was was you know based on a bogus pretext and cooked up beforehand by you know Bush and his cronies what we've what we saw in the years afterwards is that that previously called conspiracy theory was absolutely true and certainly the powerful of the world do conspire a lot of the time and to try and make sure that their interests are served in what happens in the world so so this is an inherently complicated and messy area I would say
