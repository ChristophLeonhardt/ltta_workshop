1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,999
EARLIER THIS WEEK VLADIMIR
PUTIN WAS REELECTED, HE WILL

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:09,660
LEAVE RUSSIA UNTIL 2024, I
BELIEVE, HE'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY THE

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,040
LEADER FOR QUITE A WHILE AT THIS
POINT BUT HE WON, GOT SOMETHING

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,329
LIKE 74% OF THE VOTE WHICH I
THINK WAS A NICE SUBTLE WAY TO

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,330
RUN THINGS, I THINK DRIVING IT
TO 90 OR 95% WOULD BE CRAZY.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,330
YOU

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,929
CAN'T DO 99, YOU ARE TO SADDAM
HUSSEIN, SO HE KEPT AROUND 74%.

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,199
SO IN THE WAKE OF THAT ELECTION
WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAD SIGNIFICANT

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,539
CONCERNS IN TERMS OF HOW IT WAS
RUN, THE FACT THAT THE CHIEF

10
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,649
OPPOSITION TO HIM WAS LEGALLY
BARRED FROM RUNNING MADE IT A

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,940
LITTLE RIDICULOUS, THE QUESTION
THEN BECAME WHAT VARIOUS WORLD

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,500
LEADERS CALL HIM AND
CONGRATULATE HIM, WHICH IS THE

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,960
SORT OF THING THAT HAPPENS
TYPICALLY.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
AND A NUMBER OF WORLD

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,219
LEADERS DID.

16
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,840
WOULD DONALD TRUMP?

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,930
HERE IS TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,079
>>I HAD A CALL WITH PRESIDENT
PUTIN AND CONGRATULATED HIM ON

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,780
THE VICTORY TO HIS ELECTORAL
VICTORY.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
THE CALL HAD TO DO ALSO

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,170
WITH THE FACT THAT WE WILL
PROBABLY GET TOGETHER IN THE

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,130
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE SO THAT
WE CAN DISCUSS ARMS, WE CAN

23
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,560
DISCUSS THE ARMS RACE.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,090
>>I WANT TO RETURN TO THAT ARMS
RACE THING BECAUSE I WASN'T

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,850
AWARE WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF
AN ARMS RACE RIGHT NOW BUT

26
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,770
APPARENTLY WE ARE.

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,150
SO HE DID
CALL HIM, WE FOUND OUT THAT HE

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,840
WAS TOLD SPECIFICALLY NOT TO,
BUT SOME REPUBLICANS HAD AN

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,701
ISSUE WITH HIM CALLING THIS
AUTHORITARIAN LEADER TO

30
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,240
CONGRATULATE HIM FOR WHAT
IS A SHAM ELECTION.

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,450
JOHN MCCAIN SAID --

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,670
>>AND CHUCK GRASSLEY, HEAD OF
THE SENATE JUDICIARY

33
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,670
COMMITTEE, SAID --

34
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:59,950
>>SARAH B SANDERS WAS ASKED
ABOUT THIS AT A PRESS

35
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,979
CONFERENCE AND SHE SAID --

36
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:09,199
>>WHICH IS BOTH A BIG CHANGE OF
STANCE FOR AMERICA HISTORICALLY,

37
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,730
BUT EVEN RECENTLY HADN'T
ACTUALLY KNOWN THIS BUT --

38
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,730
>>THAT'S PROBABLY JUSTIFIED --

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:30,080
>>WHICH ARE 

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,660
LIKELY ACTS WORTHY
OF PRAISE FROM THE TRUMP

41
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,190
ADMINISTRATION.

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,770
BUT THERE ARE
LIMITS ON HOW THEY WILL

43
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,770
INTERFERE.

44
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,770
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

45
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,530
>>WE HAVE A COUPLE OF
LATEBREAKING THINGS ON WHAT

46
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,190
HAPPENED, A COUPLE OF THE
SIBERIAN COUNTIES CAME IN AND

47
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,410
IT'S UP TO 77%.

48
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,490
IN ALL
SERIOUSNESS THE FINAL RESULTS, A

49
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,370
PREPOSTEROUS 77%, PARTLY BECAUSE
HE DID NOT ALLOW HIS MAIN

50
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,980
OPPOSITION TO RUN AGAINST HIM,
WHICH IS CONVENIENT BUT NOT

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,430
QUITE WHAT YOU DO IN A
DEMOCRACY, I WILL GET BACK TO

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,120
THAT IN A SECOND.

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,940
AND SENATOR
CLASSY BEN SASSE JUST SPOKE OUT

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,900
BEFORE THE SHOW, I KNOW IT'S
"SASS" THAT IT'S MORE FUN THE

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,670
OTHER WAY, AND HE WAS REHEARSED,
HE GAVE SIX MINUTES OF REMARKS

56
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,170
ON THE SENATE FLOOR SPEECH AND
HE SAID TRUMP WAS, QUOTE, VERY

57
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,760
FOOLHARDY TO HAVE DONE THIS.

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,700
HE
SAID PUTIN IS NOT A FRIEND, HE'S

59
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,510
A DESPERATE, THE PRESIDENT WAS
WRONG TO CONGRATULATE HIM, WE

60
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,540
WERE WEAKENED AS A NATION AND A
TYRANT WAS STRENGTHENED AND THE

61
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,690
CALL WAS ILL ADVISED.

62
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,480
SOME VERY
STRONG WORDS FROM OTHER

63
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,780
REPUBLICANS THAT ARE IN OFFICE.

64
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,840
NOW, WHERE DO WE COME OUT ON

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,870
THIS?

66
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,810
FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T
BELIEVE I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS

67
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,150
AND I KNOW JOHN YOU HAVE A FIRM
STANCE NOT TO BE FAIR TO TRUMP,

68
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,490
BUT TO BE FAIR TO TRUMP, AS YOU
POINTED OUT, OTHER LEADERS ALSO

69
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,151
CALLED PUTIN, GERMANY, JAPAN,
ISRAEL, CALLED TO CONGRATULATE

70
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,640
HIM.

71
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,800
ISRAEL IS MASSIVELY RIGHT
WING BUT JAPAN AND GERMANY,

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,620
OKAY, AND BY THE WAY ANOTHER
WORLD LEADER THAT CALLED PUTIN

73
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,830
AFTER HIS LAST ELECTION WAS
BARACK OBAMA, IN 2012.

74
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,830
THIS

75
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,930
ELECTION WAS PARTICULARLY
LOATHSOME BUT I SAID AT THE TIME

76
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,720
THAT THE 2012 ELECTION WAS A
SHAM.

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,480
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SHAM.

78
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,410
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE STUFF
AROUND THE EDGES IT DRIVES ME

79
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,310
CRAZY SO IN THIS CASE THERE WAS
BALLOT BOX STUFFING ACCORDING TO

80
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,200
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, POLL
WATCHERS WERE BLOCKED FROM

81
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,780
CARRYING OUT THEIR DUTIES, BUT
TO ME THAT'S JUST THE APPETIZER,

82
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,690
THE MAIN EVENT IS HE WON'T LET
PEOPLE RUN AGAINST HIM.

83
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,690
THE

84
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,810
LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURE,
NAVALNY, SORRY FOR THE TERRIBLE

85
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:02,800
PRONUNCIATION -- AND HE HAD HIM
ARRESTED ON NONSENSE CHARGES AND

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,340
SAID NOW YOU ARE A CRIMINAL AND
I GUESS YOU CAN'T RUN AGAINST

87
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,920
ME, WHAT A LUCKY BREAK I JUST
CAUGHT.

88
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I DON'T WANT TO

89
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,710
ENTERTAIN ANY TALK OF, WELL, DID
ALL OF PUTIN'S TOP POLITICAL

90
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,250
OPPONENTS THROUGHOUT ALL THESE
DECADES, WHERE THEY ALL

91
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,390
CRIMINALS?

92
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,940
THEY ALL HAPPEN TO BE
ARRESTED BEFORE THE ELECTIONS SO

93
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,360
THEY WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM
THE ELECTIONS?

94
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
>>THAT'S NOT FAIR, SOME
MYSTERIOUSLY DIE.

95
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
>>RIGHT.

96
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,480
DUDE, 77%, THAT'S NOT
A REAL ELECTION.

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,750
NONE OF THIS IS

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,750
REAL.

99
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,330
IT'S SADDAM HUSSEIN-LIKE.

100
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,690
I'M NOT ENTERTAINING ANY OF

101
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,690
THIS.

102
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,080
I DON'T THINK TRUMP
CALLING IS THAT BIG A DEAL.

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,790
>>I DON'T REALLY CARE.

104
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:54,221
>>SHAM ELECTIONS UNFORTUNATELY
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD -- ANYWAY I

105
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,490
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO OURS --
BUT I WILL IN A SECOND.

106
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,490
BUT WE

107
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,890
HAVE TO DO DIPLOMACY, SO IF HE
CALLS PEOPLE I GET IT.

108
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,530
BUT HE

109
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,750
DIDN'T NEED TO GO OVER THE TOP
AND CONGRATULATE HIM.

110
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,750
LIKE, OH,

111
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,970
I DO DECLARE, MR.

112
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,990
VLADIMIR, VERY
GOOD, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR

113
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,990
ELECTION.

114
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,550
YOU CAN JUST CALL AND
BE LIKE OKAY, I GUESS YOU'RE

115
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,680
STILL THE PRESIDENT FOR THE 18TH
TIME IN A ROW, LUCKY BREAK FOR

116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
YOU.

117
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,770
ANYWAY IF WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A SUMMIT LET'S HAVE ONE AND

118
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,150
GO ON WITH OUR LIVES.

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,950
BUT THERE
IS SOMETHING CURIOUS, AND THAT

120
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,300
LEADS FINALLY TO THE SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS LINE, WE DON'T

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,310
LIKE TO MEDDLE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
ELECTIONS.

122
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,310
YOU CAN BREAK THIS

123
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,050
APART IN A COUPLE OF WAYS, ONE,
THEY SEEM TO LIKE TO MEDDLE IN

124
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,940
OURS, AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE
MEDDLED IN THEIR ELECTION, BUT

125
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,540
IT'S OKAY TO SAY NEXT TIME CAN
YOU HAVE A REAL ONE?

126
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
THAT GOES

127
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,971
TO THE IMPORTANT POINT, WE TELL
PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, WE JUST DID

128
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:57,630
IT IN VENEZUELA AND CAMBODIA, WE
ARE THINKING OF ARGUING FOR

129
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,290
SANCTIONS, I THINK IT'S THIS
WEEK THAT MIKE PENCE IS ARGUING

130
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,690
FOR SANCTIONS FOR VENEZUELA
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THEIR

131
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,690
ELECTIONS.

132
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,990
WHAT HAPPENED TO WE
DON'T MEDDLE IN ELECTIONS?

133
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,670
THAT'S DEMONSTRABLY,
PREPOSTEROUSLY FALSE, LET ALONE

134
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,770
ALL THE COUPS, ETC., THAT WE DID
IN THE PAST, BUT RIGHT NOW WE

135
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,440
TELL PEOPLE THAT'S AN
UNACCEPTABLE ELECTION, WE WILL

136
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,360
DO ECONOMIC SECTIONS ON YOU FOR
THAT.

137
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,500
AND THEN PUTIN PUTS ON A

138
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,770
CLOWN SHOW AND TRUMP IS LIKE A
CIRCUS?

139
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,910
GREAT! AND CALLS TO

140
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,460
CONGRATULATE HIM ON HIS THREE
RING CIRCUS.

141
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,820
>>IN TERMS OF CARING ABOUT HOW
OTHER ELECTIONS WORK, I THINK

142
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,169
IT'S A TRAGEDY THAT RUSSIANS
DON'T GET TO HAVE AN ACTUAL

143
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,910
DEMOCRACY, I THINK ANYONE, EVEN
THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR SYSTEM

144
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,120
IS MANIPULATIVE, IS A TRAGEDY.

145
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,360
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THEIR

146
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,700
DESIRES TRANSLATED INTO
GOVERNMENT ACTION.

147
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
I BELIEVE IN

148
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,290
STANDING UP FOR PROGRESSIVE
ACTION EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

149
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,949
IN TERMS OF THE CALL I DON'T
CARE, MAYBE I'VE BEEN SO BEATEN

150
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,470
DOWN BY THE NEWS THAT I DON'T
HAVE ANY MORE CARE LEFT IN ME.

151
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,502
IF THE GENERAL TOPIC IS
SOMETHING TRUMP IS DOING AND IT

152
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:14,910
HAS TO DO WITH RUSSIA THIS IS
FAR DOWN ON MY LIST OF THINGS I

153
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,940
CARE ABOUT, THE ONLY THING THAT
MAKES ME VAGUELY INTERESTED

154
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,949
RIGHT NOW IS THE TIMING, I GUESS
IT DOES HAVE TO COME AFTER THE

155
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,560
ELECTION SO THAT MAKES SENSE,
BUT, I MEAN, THEY DID JUST

156
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,260
ASSASSINATE SOMEONE WITH A NERVE
AGENT THEY RELEASED INSIDE OF

157
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,110
THE U.K. LIKE A WEEK AGO, THAT
SEEMS KIND OF RELEVANT.

158
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,110
AND WE

159
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,000
JUST FOUND OUT LAST WEEK THAT
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HACKERS

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,200
HACKED INTO OUR POWER GRID, OUR
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, OUR NUCLEAR

161
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,000
POWER SYSTEMS, AND ALL OF THIS
SO THEY COULD INSTALL THE

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,890
CAPABILITY TO THEORETICALLY TURN
IT OFF AND ON WHENEVER THEY

163
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,940
WANT.

164
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,000
THAT SEEMS IMPORTANT.

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I
DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,390
ENERGY SECTOR NECESSARILY BUT
THEY JUST DID THAT.

167
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,390
IN THE WAKE

168
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,000
OF THOSE TWO THINGS -- 90 AND
2018 YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO CARE

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,130
ABOUT THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT
HAS TO DO WITH RUSSIA SO YOU ARE

170
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,480
SUPPOSED TO ATTEND THAT NONE OF
IT MATTERS AND IF YOU DO CARE

171
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,110
ABOUT IT YOU PROBABLY WANT
NUCLEAR WAR WITH RUSSIA EVEN

172
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,330
THOUGH YOU DON'T AND YOU ARE
EXPLICITLY ANTIWAR, BUT THOSE

173
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,930
THINGS THAT JUST HAPPENS OR
TIMING WISE MAYBE HE COULD HAVE

174
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,930
HELD OFF.

175
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,010
MAYBE HE COULD'VE SLID
INTO HIS DMs OR SOMETHING SO IT

176
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,760
WASN'T AS EXPLICIT BUT THE CALL,
I'M NOT GOING TO GET DOWN ON

177
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
TRUMP JUST BECAUSE HE HAD A
CALL.

178
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,240
>>WE ARE ALLOWED TO BE
RATIONAL, AND THE RATIONAL

179
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,360
REACTION IS NOT WHAT SOME OF THE
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN

180
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,630
SENATORS ARE SAYING, WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL PUTIN AND PUNCH HIM IN

181
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,540
THE FACE AND SLIT HIS THROAT ON
THE PHONE WITH HIM?

182
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,420
>>WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?

183
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
>>RIGHT.

184
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,860
OR, OH NO, IT'S OKAY,
YOU HUG IT OUT.

185
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,860
HEY, WAY TO

186
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,710
MURDER THAT PERSON WITH A NERVE
AGENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE U.K.,

187
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,080
CONGRATULATIONS, BIG GUY.

188
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,310
I
THINK IT'S FAIR TO ASK FOR

189
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,610
SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE.

190
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,500
WE CAN
DO DIPLOMACY WILL NOT

191
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,351
CONGRATULATING AN OBVIOUS TYRANT
WHO RUNS THIS COUNTRY.

192
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,351
YOU KNOW

193
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,570
WHO IS MOST HURT BY THE RUSSIAN
NON-ELECTIONS?

194
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,570
THE RUSSIAN

195
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:12,080
PEOPLE, THEY HAVE BEEN ROBBED OF
THEIR DEMOCRACY.

196
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,180
WE SHOULD BE

197
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,700
FURIOUS ABOUT THAT, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE STUPID

198
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,880
AND DEMAND WAR OR ACTIONS THAT
LEAD TO FURTHER CONFLICT.

199
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I

200
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,130
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL TRUMP
IS TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS

201
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,080
SUMMIT TO STOP THE ARMS RACE --
WHAT ARMS RACE?

202
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
AND MY GUESS IS

203
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,710
WHAT HE'S DOING IS, OH NO, I'M
BEING NICE TO PUTIN NOT BECAUSE

204
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:43,120
I'M HIS BACK POCKET, NOT AT ALL,
IT'S BECAUSE I WANT TO DO

205
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
DIPLOMACY.

206
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,210
THAT'S IT, DIPLOMACY.

207
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,210
YOU KNOW ME, I'M VERY

208
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,210
DIPLOMATIC.

209
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,500
AND SOME PEOPLE
BELIEVE IT, SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE

210
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,510
TRUMP WANTS PEACE AND DIPLOMACY.

211
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,350
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME GUY,

212
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,350
RIGHT?

213
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,120
NO, HE'S NOT BELLIGERENT,
TRUMP BEING BELLIGERENT?

214
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
HE'S

215
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
BELLIGERENT AGAINST EVERYONE.

216
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,730
JAKE TAPPER TODAY MADE A GREAT

217
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,330
POINT, TRUMP HAS BEEN MORE
BELLIGERENT TOWARDS JAKE TAPPER

218
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,670
AND DON LEMON THAN HE HAS
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

219
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,940
>>LET ALONE CHUCK TODD.

220
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,960
>>I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE
BELLIGERENT TO PUTIN, ALTHOUGH

221
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,030
IF WE ARE GOING TO LOWER NUCLEAR
WEAPONS THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

222
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:27,600
BUT TRUMP HAS SAID HE WANTS TO
DO 10 TIMES THE WEAPONS WE HAVE.

223
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,440
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S
OBVIOUS THAT HE IS NEVER GOING

224
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,640
TO CRITICIZE PUTIN AND THERE'S A
REASON FOR THAT, HE CRITICIZES

225
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,860
EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET
INCLUDING HIS CLOSEST ALLIES, HE

226
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,330
WILL VICIOUSLY ATTACK ANYONE
THAT CROSSES HIM FOR A SECOND,

227
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:51,270
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO VLAD, HE'S
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

228
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,270
SO WHY THE

229
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,380
BETA ACT?

230
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,570
YOU KNOW WHY.

231
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,810
BUT IF
YOU ARE STILL PRETENDING THAT,

232
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,660
NO, TRUMP IS TREATING PUTIN LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE, YOU ARE ON A

233
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,970
DIFFERENT PLANET DUDE.

234
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,820
JUST WAKE
UP AND REALIZE IT, RAISE YOUR

235
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,850
HAND AND GO OKAY, I CAN'T SEE
STRAIGHT.

236
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,850
TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE

237
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,520
HE'S TREATING PUTIN JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE.

238
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
OKAY, YOU LIVE

239
00:12:11,520 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH THAT BUT THAT'S NOWHERE
NEAR TRUE.
