we're gonna talk about the levels of international respect commanded by presidents Trump and Obama through the lens of how American prisoners were treated overseas over the last couple of days we saw this story about these three morons who play basketball for UCLA were arrested and hangs you China for shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store their names are Lee Angelo Bal Jalen Hill and Cody Riley now these three brain surgeons should be kicked off the team and kicked out of school they're idiots they're morons who in the world in their right mind would shoplift in China it's not exactly a country that's known for going soft and fuzzy on crime but they did it and they were facing ten years in jail enter President Donald Trump he has a quick side conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping and these kids wind up on a plane back to the United States President Trump goes on to tweet whoa do you think the three UCLA basketball players will say thank you president Trump they were headed for ten years in jail Donald Trump's 100% right these kids were gonna do hard labor in a brutal oppressive Chinese prison it's a place you don't want to be heading in there idiots they embarrassed the United States they embarrassed their team their teammates their school their schoolmates they should be booted off the team and kicked out a UCLA but that's a whole nother segment and many many many people have done it that's not where I'm going with this today's show is about the contrast of how Donald Trump is treated by world leaders and how Barack Obama was used as a doormat I mean if you recall just over the last couple of weeks you saw the president president Trump come off Air Force One in China and kids and gymnastics that were doing gymnastics and flags were flying and bands were playing and there's a red carpet and he's larger than life and Melania looks gorgeous and when Obama went to China they made him come down the back stairs of Air Force One without any real official breeding delegation they had no respect for Obama really nobody had any respect for Obama cos he didn't command respect but let's go back to the way American prisoners were treated under Obama and there were many incidents but I pulled a few that'll upset you they'll infuriate you here's Obama cared about prisoners just the right ones now remember Marine Sergeant Andrew tahmooressi while sergeant amory's he was in his vehicle near the Mexican border and he made a wrong turn and he wound up on a ramp that put him back in Mexico there was no other way he could go hit guns in his vehicle and when he got to Mexico he was arrested for the firearms despite telling Mexican customs and US Customs where he was trying to go what he was trying to do and despite that particular ramp having confused many many drivers before tomorry see it was a pretty common occurrence that people would lose their way on that ramp line up in Mexico and have to be turned around but Tamara see unfortunately at a few guns in his vehicle he was arrested and he spent seven brutal months in a Mexican prison alongside narco traffickers the worst of the worst these people who murder and behead on behalf of the cartels and leave bodies hanging in the streets of Mexico this 26 year old who had served this nation in wars the United States Marine was rotting in that Mexican prison and Barack Obama did nothing it took members of Congress it took sergeant Amory C's mom it took everybody but Barack Obama to get him out in seven months later he came out he was psychologically in terrible terrible shape and really hasn't recovered since now even more egregious than that is the case about a warm buyer the warm buyer was also an idiot this guy went to North Korea is a University of Virginia student and he went to North Korea in January 2016 and was arrested soon thereafter North Korea said he was committing vandalism and criminal mischief and either trying to steal a poster and to face up oh who knows if the North Koreans are telling the truth why in the world would warm buyer go there that all said though warm buyer winds up spending like a year and a half in North Korea and he dies a few days after coming back to the United States now nobody really knows why the coroner's report didn't necessarily show torture there could have been malnutrition they could have given him drugs just general poor treatment that all said this guy he was 22 years old eventually another kid rotted in a North Korean prison I can't think of a worse place on the planet to be and Barack Obama did nothing in fact warm buyer was only released after Donald Trump started rattling sabers with North Korea and getting tough he wasn't sending strongly worded letters and UN resolution Trump started Parkin or aircraft carriers off their coast and that sent a message was there a correlation of that and warm buyer being released I think so others say not but I believe so unfortunately he died but again Barack Obama did nothing for him and did nothing for Sergeant amore see Barack Obama did care about some prisoners though Barack Obama traded five Taliban commanders for traitor for deserter Bowe Bergdahl remember that Barack Obama did be he press conference with his parents in the Rose Garden and he acted concerned he hugged the dad who he later found out had radical leanings and he traded five Taliban commanders for Bowe Bergdahl who Obama made sound like that the second coming of a Medal of Honor winner Medal of Honor recipient well it turned out that Bergdahl was a run-of-the-mill deserter Bergdahl got soldiers killed looking for him and Obama sent five deadly terrorist commanders back to the battlefield to get this desert tear less if they were killing other Americans out there couldn't care less if they committed terrorist attacks on American soil Bergdahl was a radical Obama had to get his radical back it wasn't the only one Bradley Manning was now Chelsea Manning Bradley Manning one of the worst traitors in American history Bradley Manning now Chelsea Manning who breached classified information protocols committed treason and handed thousands upon thousands upon thousands of documents to Wikileaks that that revealed some of our deepest state secrets that put our intelligence people our military people in grave danger might have gotten some killed Bradley / Chelsea Manning who was convicted for that and sentenced to a very long prison term had that sentence commuted by Barack Obama by Barack Obama with no rhyme nor reason in fact it's unprecedented for presidents to commute the sentences of traitors traitors as egregious as Manning but again that was Barack Obama's priority not the Marine Sergeant held captive in Mexico and not the misguided Bert cited college student who was being treated very very poorly in North Korea because Obama was the world's doormat and it is just so great it feels so wonderful I'm energized they have pride again in an America's projection of force around the world I'm not a globalist but I do believe that America needs to project force because terrorists get here way too easily and Donald Trump has put the world on notice America's back America first don't screw with us don't screw with our people and again I hope these UCLA ball players get the boot from the team in the school they were complete idiots and he probably should have let them sit there and and you know worry a little bit for a few months you need to learn their lesson they were coddled I think a little too quickly in this one but man isn't it great to have a president with the juice globally to make something like that happen if you want me to keep bringing you this very very important content please subscribe to
