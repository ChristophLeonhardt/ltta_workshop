got something on on the front of it

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,779
which tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's inside it was</font>

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,540
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found so I was given and I'm</font>

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,019
certain that it is what it is inside

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,449
that if you were ever to face be faced

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,080
with a situation in which you know you

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,369
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life it's there in</font>

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,290
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meaning of life was you perhaps</font>

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,719
were to be given definitive proof of

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,969
what your purpose in life was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,430
knew it was the absolute truth if you

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,770
knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this would be what your life</font>

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,860
is meant to be about what the meaning

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,430
and purpose of your life is on this

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,559
planet forever more would you actually

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,140
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear it there'll be some of you</font>

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,260
doing the right thing I can make sure

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,229
you know I'm gonna go the right way so

27
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,689
if there is an afterlife that I will do

28
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,880
the righteous thing maybe what happens

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,369
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you die isn't even hinted at in</font>

30
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,409
the meaning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> life but as long as you</font>

31
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,479
can do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your what you know you're</font>

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to be but others may not others</font>

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,210
benefit mankind it won't benefit me this

37
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,460
leads to a side issue of what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

39
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,600
mankind should be able to see this or

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,420
not this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in your hands but the</font>

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,759
reasons why you may not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to open it</font>

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,200
the reasons why you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to know</font>

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">what your purpose is different reasons</font>

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,360
really there can be those that go why do

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,770
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be told what I want to do I</font>

46
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,899
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have free will with no worry of</font>

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,060
what I should be doing technically there

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,710
is already that on this planet with

49
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,299
morals and that and you know the

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,280
commandments what you thought of

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,020
direction should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but what if</font>

52
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,740
you were told what was exactly what you

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,419
should be doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a good thing and</font>

54
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,000
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> those that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the line not</font>

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,610
sure

56
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,190
when weighing out things the pros and

57
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">cons but at the end of the day they have</font>

58
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,120
to make a decision they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either open</font>

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,640
this or they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop it and leave it</font>

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,470
there are those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to you</font>

61
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,960
know know what the meaning of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life is</font>

62
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,790
but at the same time if you were told

63
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,900
what life is all about isn't half the

64
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,940
enjoyment of life sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not knowing</font>

65
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,820
everything and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's the quest</font>

66
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,709
of finding out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a meaning for yourself</font>

67
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,500
and all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that I mean I</font>

68
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,650
know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff I do is philosophy</font>

69
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,810
based sand when I write I express myself

70
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,900
and you know frustrations with life with

71
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,940
all that be gone if you were to take the

72
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,000
meaning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> life in your hand open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,300

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking I'm so excited</font>

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:14,080
Oh what that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappointing life is so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I feel so cheap God believe it</font>

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,030

78
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,560

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,140
you just get me all curious and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

80
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,850
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me that how much</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's a good thing you bring us a</font>

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,630
good thing but that's what we're about

84
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,820
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been disappointed</font>

85
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,980
all this build-up you find look at it

86
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,680
what if it's not what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,750
tough you know that is what we're here

88
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,019
for but then is it worth the risk of

89
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,299
being disappointed when we're happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

90
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,370
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now what would</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you do if you were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given the opportunity</font>

92
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,700
which you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what the meaning</font>

93
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,510
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life is I mean from a standpoint it's</font>

94
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,299
the incredible to have that decision you

95
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,070
know that cutoff point you can have that

96
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,930
pivotal moment in your life where you

97
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,880
will actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out what the meaning</font>

98
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,738
of life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if it was out of you who</font>

99
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">would know it would you then go and</font>

100
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,589
spread the word maybe that would be

101
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">another bad thing about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there be</font>

102
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,950
complications with other people believe

103
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you were to tell them</font>

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,540
your discovery I guess with something

105
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,220
like this even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you were to question</font>

106
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,290
it yourself is what is definitive proof

107
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,910
when it comes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

find out what the meaning of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life is or</font>

112
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,530
do you want to discard it and let it go

113
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,200
and just not note and get on with<font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>
