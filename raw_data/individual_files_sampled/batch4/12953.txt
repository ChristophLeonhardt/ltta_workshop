why is God why does it appear that God is invisible why is he hidden from us that's a question that believers have been grappling with for millennia it's also a question that among atheist I think is probably considered the number one for many atheists it would seem it is considered the number one argument against the existence of God because they say that look an all-powerful being a being who is responsible for creating all things who rules over all things he would not remain invisible to us he would he would reveal himself unmistakably especially if he looks upon it and and and and you think well if I were God you know and I created this world of people and I looked and I saw this world and I saw especially the people were falling away and falling away from belief and there were so much suffering and misery and pain and so forth well then I would I would appear I would make myself clear I would say hey everybody listen up look Here I am here's God here's what I want you to do here's how I want you to live I wouldn't pass down these truths in a in a in a in a book in an ancient book I wouldn't trust human few other humans to you know impart the knowledge I would just appear and I would make it clear I think that's kind of the atheist argument and I think even even non atheist even believers have had moments of of wondering this I think we all probably have we've all we've all grappled with this question I know I've had I'll admit that I've had moments in prayer sometimes where I say to God I say God if you would just reveal yourself to me I mean can you just reveal yourself can you come out of the shadows just for one second and just show me your glory in all of its fullness just for one second that's all I'm asking for just one second just one second if I had just one second just just a blink of an eye if I'd a one second vision of heaven of the supernatural realm of the world that lies beyond this one if I had just that one second that would be enough to sustain me for the rest of my life I could live for a hundred years for a thousand years on just that one second but the vision never comes it's never come to me it's never come to most of us and I think for most of us it never will come at least not in this life why well I think that there are I'm going to offer three answers to that to that question and these are not not claiming that these are the three answers I'm just saying that these are three answers they may not even be the best answers but as I've thought about this this problem this is what I've concluded why is God first answer and the most obvious hint is that he isn't it at least not in the way and not to the extent that atheists would claim God has revealed himself to mankind countless times through the ages and as a Christian I would say of course that that the greatest and most definitive revelation came in the person of Jesus Christ Jesus was born he ministered on earth he performed miracles he was crucified he was resurrected and then he ascended and he was not hidden during that time and these events themselves were not hidden and since then and before that God has revealed himself in other ways to other people and there again have been countless stories of visions and supernatural events and miraculous unexplainable healings and so forth so all of these things and you can choose to disbelieve these signs and you can choose to disbelieve in God and you can choose to disbelieve in Jesus Christ and and and and all of that but but if you do you must admit that you are not disbelieving a hidden God because that is not the God that we believe in we believe in a God who has revealed himself repeatedly to the human race so we do not believe in an entirely in God
