my name is David Goldberg founder and CEO of fresh Netcom often call the Netflix for ties and today we're going to show you how to tie a bowtie so to start you want to drape it around your neck want to put your collar up you want to have the left side hanging about two inches lower than the right side take that longer side you put it over and around the other side kind of like tying a regular tie tighten the knot you know as tight as you can while still feeling comfortable and you'll have two pieces of pretty much equal length you want to take the back piece sort of move it back over your left shoulder and fold it forward and this will be the front of your boat on you can start to see that shape coming together take the right side up bring it around and that's gonna create that middle not in the bus now this is the part that gets a lot of people you want to take the two ends of the front part pinch them together kind of like a butterfly and pull them forward a little bit if that does is you see on the side it creates a little bit of a hole here on the side then you want to take your other piece again fold it forward and put it through that hole feels a little awkward you might have to let go of the bowtie to sort of get it to come through you see the shake starting to come together you're going to be left with is two bows one in the front one in the back and then two single pieces you're gonna use the two bows to tighten the knot and then you're going to use the two single pieces to adjust the size kind of keep going a few times you may need a mirror make some adjustments and I think that's pretty much kind of what we're looking at and then it's very easy to adjust do this way go and smile compatible type you
