â™ª JOHN TESTER OF A REALLY GREAT PLACE, MONTANA, WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THIS GREAT AMERICAN DOCTOR, RONNY JACKSON, AN ADMIRAL IN THE NAVY. AND TESTER STARTED THROWING OUT THINGS THAT HE'S HEARD. I KNOW THINGS ABOUT TESTER THAT I COULD SAY, TOO. AND IF I SAID THEM, HE WOULD NEVER BE ELECTED AGAIN. BRIAN: RIGHT. STEVE: WHAT ARE THEY? I WANT TO KNOW. BRIAN: DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT AND HOST OF THE DAN BONGINO VERY SUCCESSFUL PODCAST. WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU HEARD THAT LINE? NUMBER ONE I KNOW YOU KNOW DR. JACKSON. NOT ONLY IS HE NOT GOING TO BE THE NEXT V.A. SECRETARY. NOT GOING TO GET A HEARING AND NO LONGER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. KNOWING THAT AND TESTER CAME OUT WITH INNUENDOS AND ALLEGATIONS, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NEXT STEP IS? WELL, I WILL TELL WHAT YOU IT SHOULD BE. TESTER SHOULD RESIGN, BRIAN, YESTERDAY. A ZAP, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE MAN DISGRACED HIMSELF. HE DISGRACED THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, MOST CRITICALLY, HE HAS DISGRACED AN AMERICAN PATRIOT. A GOOD MAN. A FRIEND BUT I SAY THIS NOT OUT OF A SENSE OF FRIENDSHIP, BRIAN, I MEAN. THIS I WANT TO BE CLEAR. NO ONE HAS ASKED ME TO SAY ANYTHING RONNY JACKSON. NOT RONNY, NOT A FRIEND OF RONNY'S. NOT HIS FAMILY. NOBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS WAS A MAN I KNEW PERSONALLY. THIS WAS A MAN WHO SAVED MY BUTT MANY TIMES WHEN I WAS SICK OVERSEAS IN THE SECRET SERVICE. ALL OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, I HAVE NEVER, BRIAN, I WAS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT GUY ON THE GROUND. WHEN THERE WAS SOME KIND OF PROBLEM ON A VISIT WITH THE DOCTOR OR SOMEONE IN THE MILITARY OR ANYONE ELSE, ME AS A SECRET SERVICE MAN I WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED. I NEVER SAW ANY OF THIS. THIS IS A JOKE AND THIS WAS A POLITICAL HIT JOB OF THE HIGHEST ORDER. STEVE: THERE WERE THOSE TWO PAGES OF CIRCUMSTANTIALLY OPPO RESEARCH THAT TESTER APPARENTLY WAS RELYING UPON. A LOT OF STUFF WAS EASY TO CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS TRUE. IN FACT, OVER THE WEEKEND, I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SECRET SERVICE CAME OUT AND SAID YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, HE NEVER ACTUALLY DID CRASH THAT CAR. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. BUT THE INSINUATION THAT HE WAS GIVING OUT PILLS LIKE THEY CALLED HIM THE CANDY MAN. WHEN YOU ARE AN AN OVERSEAS TRIP AND YOU ARE 10 TIMES ZONES OFF. I'M SURE EVERYBODY IN YOUR DETAIL PROBABLY ASKED FOR A SLEEP AID. YOU KNOW, STEVE, LET ME WALK THIS SNOWFLAKE CROWD THROUGH HOW THIS WORKS, OKAY? THIS IS THE REAL WORLD, YOU CHUMPS. THIS IS NOT A COLLEGE CAMPUS, OKAY? YOU DON'T GET TO GO TO A CRY ROOM AND CRY IT OUT BECAUSE THE PROFESSOR YELLED AT YOU OR A CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER IS ON CAMPUS. IN THE REAL WORLD IN THE SECRET SERVICE IN THE MILITARY, WHEN YOU GO TO A FOREIGN HOT ZONE TO KEEP THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY ALIVE AND YOU CAN'T SLEEP, YOU CAN'T PROTECT THIS GUY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? PEOPLE COULD DIE OR GET HURT. SO THE FACT THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE A SLEEP AID TO GET A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP TO GET YOUR BUTT UP AND KEEP THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ALIVE, LISTEN UP, SNOKES, THAT'S SNOWES, THAT'S SNOWFL, THAT'S SNOWFLAKTHAT'S SNOWFLAKESAT'S SNOWFLAKES T'S SNOWFLAKES THAT'S HOW THE REAL WORLD WORKS. THAT THAT OFFENDED YOUR SENSITIVITIES PARDON MY LANGUAGE. I'M SICK OF THIS CASE. I NEVER SEEN A BETTER MAN TAKEN DOWN BY A MORE DISGUSTING GROUP OF PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. AINSLEY: THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS UPSET ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW HIM PERSONALLY YOU DO. AND EVERYONE WHO KNOWS HIM HAVE ONE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT HIM. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR REPUTATION, YOU GIVE OUT A FEW PILLS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CANDY MAN LOGO AND START LOOKING AT YOUR BACKGROUND AND DRIVING RECORD. DAN DAN AINSLEY, HE HAD NO CHANCE TO CORRECT IT. THE LIE TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD BEFORE RONNY GOT TO EVEN OPEN HIS MOUTH. I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO READ THE PIECE IN THE DAILY CALLER BY THE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE PRESIDENT'S DETAIL. MIKE WHITE, GUY WORKED FOR. ANOTHER AMERICAN PATRIOT. HONORABLE GUY. READ ABOUT WHAT HE WROTE ABOUT RONNY JACKSON. HE HAD NO REASON TO PUT HIS HE IS NOT THAT KIND OF GUY, MIKE. DID HE IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF GUY HE WAS. BRIAN: NOT ONLY GET THE JOB NOT EVEN BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HARD TIME WITH JOHN TESTER IS ESPECIALLY IF YOU READ BETWEEN THE LINES IS FELLOW DEMOCRAT ADAM SCHIFF. LISTEN TO THIS. I'M ALWAYS TROUBLED WHEN ACCUSATIONS ARE ANONYMOUS. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN RELY ON THAT KIND OF ANONYMOUS CLAIM. DID TESTER GO OVER-THE-LINE ON THIS ONE. I IMAGINE FOLKS HAVE BEEN TALKING TO SENATOR TESTER WHO ARE GOING TO BECOME PUBLIC AND NOT ANONYMOUS. THE ADMINISTRATION REALIZED THAT AND THAT'S WHY THEY WITHDREW THE NOMINATION. YES, IF IT WERE ON NOTHING MORE THAN THE ANONYMOUS CLAIMS, THAT'S A SLENDER READ. STEVE: WHATEVER HAPPENED TO INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY? OH, YOU ARE EXPECTING THAT FROM ADAM SCHIFF? CAPTAIN CONSPIRACY THEORY? I MEAN, ASKING HIM ABOUT LIES ON CAPITOL HILL, I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE ASKING A BANK ROBBER AFTER HE IS DONE ROBBING A BANK FOR A COMMENT ABOUT THE BANK ROBBERY. ADAM SCHIFF IS KNEE DEEP IN CAPITOL HILL DISHONESTY. HE ALMOST SINGLE-HANDEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAIRY TALE. WHEN HE COMES OUT AND IS CRITICAL OF TESTER BRINGING UP INNUENDO, I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT. YEAH. I MEAN, LISTEN. I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE FORCEFUL. HE IS DOING THE DANCE UP THERE AND I DON'T SPREECHT IT THEY SHOULD COME OUT AND SAY LISTEN, THIS WAS FLAT OUT WRONG. TESTER SHOULD HAVE AT A MINIMUM ISSUED AN APOLOGY. I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE RESIGNED OVER THE WEEKEND. HE CAN'T ATTACK BACK. IF HE GO AFTER THE PRESIDENT HARD HE LOSES ANY WOULD BE REPUBLICAN. THE G.O.P. IS TARGETING HIM TO SWITCH THAT SEAT. AINSLEY: DAN, QUICKLY, WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE? YEAH. I WASN'T GOING TO BRING THIS UP ON MY FACEBOOK BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIKE A HEY LOOK AT ME TYPE OF THING. YEAH, THEY ARE SPAMMING MY CONTENT. STEVE: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS IF YOU SHARE MY PODCAST ON FACEBOOK, I HAVE HUNDREDS OF EMAILS FROM PEOPLE WHO SAID THIS POST HAS BEEN MARKED AS SPAM. LISTEN, YOU MAY NOT LIKE MY CONTENT, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SPAM. WE PUT OUT ONE SHOW A DAY. THIS IS JUST, AGAIN, INDICATIVE OF THIS SOCIAL MEDIA WAR AGAINST CONSERVATIVES. I HAVE BEEN HIT ON TWITTER WHERE THEY DISCONTINUED MY ADS. IT'S RELENTLESS. I'M THINKING ABOUT QUITTING FACEBOOK. REALLY. THIS IS A BATTLE I'M GOING THROUGH. BRIAN: THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO. THEY MAY. FACEBOOK MAKES MONEY OFF PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME PUTTING CONTENT ON IT AND THE MINUTE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME SAY OH NO NOT TODAY. MAYBE THEY WILL WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE. STEVE: I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, DAN. WE WILL PUT ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE YOUR DIRECT APPEAL TO MARK ZUCKERBERG WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL HIM ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO YOU? MARK, YOU KNOW, 40% OF AMERICA DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE, NECESSARILY. AND IT'S NOT THE BEST BUSINESS PLAN IN THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, TO TELL THEM GO POUND SAND. THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK OUT IN THE LONG TERM. STEVE: CHECK INTO DAN BONGINO APPARENTLY BEING
