is this very good it almost tastes like a barbecue sandwich there is so much chili in here this is delicious my favorite is definitely the chili dog kind of like how it gets a little messy but also the dog itself is delicious that grilled flavor on there it was fantastic boom it's actually spicier and I was expecting this is a very tasty chili cheese dog it's gonna eat another one cuz why not and I'm gonna have another bite really
