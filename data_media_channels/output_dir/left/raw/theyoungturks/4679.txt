1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,920
TODAY CHURCHES ACROSS AMERICA
CELEBRATED A NEW SUPREME COURT

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,080
RULING THAT WOULD OPEN THE WAY

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,680
FOR SOME TAXPAYER MONEY TO GO TO
CHURCH PROJECTS.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,680
TODAY WE WILL

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,870
TELL YOU ABOUT ONE IN
PARTICULAR, THE TRINITY LUTHERAN

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,870
CHURCH.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,440
WE WANT TO START FROM
THE BEGINNING AND SHOW YOU THE

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:35,220
BATTLE THEY WAGED.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,220
THEY WANTED

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:50,489
TO RUBBERIZE IT FOR SAFETY
REASONS.

11
00:00:50,489 --> 00:01:04,830
AS WE KNOW IT IS REALLY ROUGH ON

12
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:22,869
CHRISTIANS 
IN AMERICA.

13
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:40,470
JOHN
ROBERTS SAID THIS.

14
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,470
I BELIEVE IT

15
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,761
IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON TO

16
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:45,990
NOT BE DECEPTIVE WHEN THEY USE
THE PHRASE ODIOUS TO THE

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,990
CONSTITUTION.

18
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,050
BUT HE IS A FAN OF
THIS.

19
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,920
SONIA SOTOMAYOR READ

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,960
ALOUD HER DISSENTING OPINION.

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:20,419
THAT IS 
A 

22
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:21,419
GREAT TURN OF PHRASE

23
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,419
THERE.

24
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:23,760
THIS MONEY WILL NOW

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,760
EFFECTIVELY, RATHER THAN HAVING
TO RAISE AND SPEND IT SELF, EVEN

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,049
IF THE SCHOOL AND THE PLAYGROUND
IS NOT A PART OF WORSHIP, THAT

27
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,069
IS A FINANCIAL BENEFIT GOING
TO THAT CHURCH.

28
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,989
BEFORE I GET TO MY ACTUAL
COMMENT, LET'S HAVE FUN AND

29
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,669
ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORD RUBBERIZE
IS FUNNY.

30
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:44,669
IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO

31
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:45,669
SAY OTHER SCHOOLS ARE GETTING
PLAYGROUND, WHY CAN'T THE

32
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,669
CHURCH?

33
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,669
BUT WE DON'T SPEND
TAXPAYER MONEY ON CHURCHES OR

34
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,669
TEMPLES OR MOSQUES.

35
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,669
OF COURSE
THE NATIONAL EXTENSION OF THAT

36
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,010
IS THE PLAYGROUND, OR THE DOOR.

37
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,359
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU SEE THE PROBLEM

38
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,719
HERE WHICH IS THAT IT SHOULD
APPLY TO ALL RELIGIONS, AND THAT

39
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,719
IS WHERE SOME CONSERVATIVES

40
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,719
MIGHT GO ñ

41
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,269
MUSLIM COMMUNITY CENTERS ARE
PROBABLY VERY EXCITED ABOUT

42
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,269
THIS.

43
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:02,269
THIS IS A MESS.

44
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,059
THERE IS
NO END TO THAT.

45
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,059
EVERYONE ELSE

46
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,949
GETS FEATURES- SO JUST REMEMBER
THE PRINCIPLES, IF YOU HAVE ANY

47
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,540
AND YOU SHOULD APPLY IT EQUALLY
DOT IN THIS CASE, THERE IS A

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:04:45,939
REASON WHY THE FOUNDING FATHERS
SET THIS REPUBLIC UP IN A 

49
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:46,939
WAY

50
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:47,939
THAT SAID THAT WE SHALL NOT MIX

51
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,389
STATE AND CHURCH.

52
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,909
YES, IT MAY
SEEM SILLY TO DENY THOSE POOR

53
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:59,770
KIDS A NICE RUBBERIZED
PLAYGROUND, BUT IT IS A VERY

54
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,340
IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE.

55
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,840
IT SET THE PRECEDENT, THAT IS
WHY WE ARE CONCERNED AND WHY THE

56
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,349
PEOPLE THAT ARE HAPPY TODAY ARE
HAPPY.

57
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,349
THEY ARE NOT HAPPY

58
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:18,009
BECAUSE OF SOME RUBBERIZATION
GOING ON.

59
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:32,889
THERE IS A FOOTNOTE THAT THIS
ATTEMPTS TO SAY THIS A SPECIFIC.

60
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:44,259
SO THEORETICALLY THIS DOES NOT

61
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,600
NEED TO SET A PRECEDENT.

62
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,820
I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT.

63
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,280
THAT IS INTERESTING.

64
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,460
SOME OF
THE SO-CALLED LIBERAL JUSTICES

65
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,349
ALSO VOTED FOR THIS.

66
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:56,349
ONE THEORY

67
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:59,409
IS, THEY DID SO THAT SO THEY CAN
GET THAT FOOTNOTE PUT IN.

68
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,409
IF

69
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:10,940
THAT IS TRUE, WHY ARE ALL THE
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN THE

70
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,360
COUNTRY CELEBRATING TODAY?

71
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,409
THEY
THINK WE JUST TRICKED THE

72
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,680
LIBERALS, THAT FOOTNOTE DOESN'T

73
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
MEAN ANYTHING.

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,020
AND THEN ALL THEY
HAVE TO DO IS GET FIVE

75
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,509
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES TO QUOTE

76
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:27,229
THE CASE LATER AND THEY
ARE DONE WITH IT.

77
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,550
IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE CAN
TREAT CONSERVATIVES INTO BEING

78
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,389
AGAINST THE SAYING THAT THEY

79
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,789
RUBBERIZING OF A
PLAYGROUND IS PART

80
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,360
OF A CONTINUED WAS A VACATION OF

81
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
AMERICAN CHILDREN?

82
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,889
WHEN I GREW
UP I DIDN'T NEED NO RUBBER.

83
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:51,159
IT'S A BAD DAY FOR PEOPLE ñ
IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR OWN

84
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:56,669
RELIGION AND PROTECTING IT, YOU

85
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:58,620
WOULD NOT BE IN FAVOR OF THIS.

86
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,029
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CARE ABOUT AN

87
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:04,289
IRRATIONAL RULE OF LAW YOU
SHOULD BE CONCERNED AND YOU

88
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:12,000
WOULD NOT TRUST A CONSERVATIVE
WHEN HE SAYS IT ONLY APPLIES TO

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS.
