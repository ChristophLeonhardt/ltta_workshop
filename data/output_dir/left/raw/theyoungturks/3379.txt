1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,100
YESTERDAY WE PRESENTED THE
EVIDENCE THAT ATTY.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,100
GEN.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,460
JEFF SESSIONS HAD LIED ABOUT HIS
KNOWLEDGE OF COMMUNICATIONS

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,440
BETWEEN RUSSIAN OFFICIALS AND
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DURING

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,420
THE LAST ELECTION.

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,049
THAT LIE CONSTITUTED A FEDERAL
CRIME BECAUSE IT HAPPENED WHILE

7
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:22,900
HE WAS UNDER OATH AND TESTIFYING
BEFORE THE SENATE.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,179
THEN WE HAVE THE VIDEO OF AL
FRANKEN TALKING WITH JEFF

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,190
SESSIONS WHERE HE SAYS HE HAD NO
KNOWLEDGE OF COMMUNICATIONS

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,869
DESPITE THE FACT HE WAS THE ONE
WHO VEHEMENTLY SHUT DOWN THAT

11
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,660
DISCUSSION AT A NATIONAL
SECURITY MEETING BACK

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,700
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,370
WAS INTERESTING WHEN IT WAS
REVEALED THAT THROUGH AN

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:47,870
INTERMEDIARY WE LEARNED THAT
SESSIONS RECALLED 単 THAT SOURCE

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:58,899
LATER CLARIFIED 単 IT'S NOT
IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO ME IF THAT

16
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,590
IS A BACKTRACK BECAUSE OF THE
REACTION TO SESSIONS SAYING

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,930
I DID ACTUALLY REMEMBER THAT.

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,640
THEY SEEM TO BE TRYING TO MUDDY
THE WATERS A LITTLE BIT.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,611
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LEARNED IN
THE INTERIM THAT THAT IS A

20
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:15,990
FEDERAL CRIME.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,990
>>

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:30,810
IT IS WONDERFULLY PREPOSTEROUS,
THE LAST STATEMENT.

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,680
WAIT, HOW DOES HE KNOW HE DID SO
IF HE DOESN'T RECALL IT?

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,619
>>I'M NOT SURE THAT SOURCE KNOWS
WHAT THE WORD CLARIFIES MEANS.

25
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,040
>> THAT IDEA OF POON AND TRUMP
MEETING, I SPITE THAT, BUT

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,659
I DON'T REMEMBER IF I DID.

27
00:01:50,659 --> 00:02:00,000
THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,640
THAT MEANS I LIED AND HENCE I
CAN BE THROWN OUT OF OFFICE.

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,590
>>UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT THE
FIRST TIME HE HAS HAD A

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,850
PROBLEM WITH HIS MEMORY.

31
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,380
HE INITIALLY DURING
SOME OF HIS EARLY 単

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,680
BACK WHEN HE WAS TRYING
TO BECOME ATTY.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
GEN.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,610
SAID HE HAD HAD NO CONTACT.

35
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,370
THAT IT WAS I MET WITH THE
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR BUT I DIDN'T

36
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,290
TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN, THEN I
DID MEET WITH THE RUSSIAN AMB.

37
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,570
AND WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT
INTERFERENCE.

38
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,570
THE GOALPOST KEPT MOVING.

39
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:47,610
NOW AL FRANKEN HAS A RESPONSE
SAYING THIS.

40
00:02:47,610 --> 00:03:17,451
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY
WOULD'VE IN THE PRESENT

41
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:22,070
FIRST PLACE, BUT THAT ISN'T THE
POINT.

42
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,250
NORMALLY WHEN I START WITH
THAT TONE OF

43
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,230
VOICE I AM BEING SARCASTIC.

44
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,560
HE
IS ON THE OLDER SIDE, MAYBE HIS

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,900
MEMORY IS SKETCHY?

46
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,760
WHEN YOU
VEHEMENTLY SHUT DOWN DISCUSSION

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,290
DURING ONE OF THE FEW
HIGH-PROFILE MEETINGS OF THIS

48
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:57,830
GROUP, 単 I WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT
AS HE IN JAIL.

49
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,620
ACTUAL CREDIT WE SHOULD GIVE US
ALL FRANKEN FOR DOING A GOOD JOB

50
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,460
AND QUESTIONING.

51
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,270
GREAT JOB THERE.

52
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,910
IF YOU DON'T RECALL THE
REPUBLICANS THINK THAT LYING

53
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,240
UNDER OATH IS ONE OF THE WORST
CRIMES AND YOU SHOULD BE

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,820
IMMEDIATELY IMPEACHED FOR IT.

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,310
THEY IMPEACHED BILL CLINTON FOR
LYING UNDER OATH.

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:00:00,000
BY THEIR OWN STANDARDS JEFF
SESSIONS SHOULD IMPEACH HIMSELF.
