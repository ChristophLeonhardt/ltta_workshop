controversial white helmets group is again causing divisions NASA after reporters without borders urged the Swiss Press Club to cancel a conference critical of the syrian activists the request was rejected by the head of the organization as modern-day censorship we were challenged and our support for this conference with the name of our organization appearing on the list of many members we totally dissociate ourselves from this event and do not wish to be associated with the conference we invite you to abandon this project which will damage the image of the Swiss Press Club it was very surprising and very disappointing to see the journalists association asking for the kind of censorship that was my first reaction and so I decided to reply writing a letter and asking them to respect the freedom of the speech and the Swiss Constitution more Agastya who previously conducted his own investigation into the white helmets on the ground in syria has more details on what caused the split between the journalist organizations so far almost everything you've been told about the white helmets is stuff from their press releases and video productions not from locals or civilians no no from white helmet sponsors and PR agents that's great and all but let's at least hear from the people they say they're saving shows them helping the peoples they only help their own rebel fighters their relatives those close to them the last thing they cared about civilians caps it down more yeah whenever food aid was brought into East Aleppo the white helmets and the rebels would take it all for themselves they give us nothing not even bread yes what there were many people buried alive the white helmets would come to save their own and if they found civilians they might help and they might not oh that's a huge surprise what a shocker the white helmets aren't perfect who would have thought they're just regular people with their own shortcomings there Oh agenda just like everyone else so why on earth would Reporters Without Borders want to censor this absolutely obvious fact cooling it Russian propaganda I think it was the topic which was disturbing this disguise now having described the white helmets as an independent organization they cannot admit they were wrong and yes they didn't even admit to here the people who are criticizing the white helmets as it was a taboo to speak about that that's impossible for serious journalists simply honest person to admit such such a behavior it's the first time in the 20 years of the existence of the Swiss Pascrell that we receive such demands from a journalist Association which is supposed to support to support the press freedom for whatever reason it is taboo no one in the mainstream media where an Western government says anything remotely critical the white helmets you remember ever hearing anything and flattering well Reporters Without Borders has all but taken sides let's not forget in 2016 they named a Syrian rebel activist in there journalist of the year he he is taunting Syrian conscripts buried under rubble he says he wants them to taste a slow death a Swiss Press Club has made a point not to judge for me I cannot see myself in a mirror if I am the big censorship deciding you have the right to speak you have not the right to speak because you are representing the bad the supposed bad camp the bad part and it is paid off they've received an outpouring of support internationally and they vow to continue doing what they do irregardless of pressure I also received many people criticizing Russia from its forms and garry kasparov misses names over who were criticized criticizing Russia so I am open to everybody even to the people who are supporting Russia and not only criticizing that's I think the goal of a real Press Club and not politically correct Association
