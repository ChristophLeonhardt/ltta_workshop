My father, José Perez,
died as an indirect result
of Hurricane Maria.
He is shoe No. 399.
No. 2851.
My mother, Juanita
Mélendez Betancourt
died of a heart attack
due to complications
from Hurricane Maria.
I cry because it’s hard
to see a system erasing
the pain of the people.
You cannot erase that.
And you have to be respectful
with the dead ones.
Shoe No. 2231.
My grandmother spent Hurricane
Irma and Hurricane Maria
at the hospital.
She was a patient
on hemodialysis.
In this moment, 2018,
we’re having “desaparecidos,”
thousand of people who 
are completely disappeared,
invisible to the system.
We want to make a closure.
We want to finish.
We want to close that pain.
Jiram Perez — 
shoe No. 2860.
My grandfather passed away
in the horrible aftermath
of Hurricane Maria.
These are human beings.
They are not just
numbers or statistics.
They have faces.
They lived.
They loved.
They are gone.
They are missed.
We demand the
governor of Puerto Rico
to be prepared for the
next hurricane season.
We demand that President Trump
to apologize to the country
of throwing towels.
If you look at a real
catastrophe like Katrina —
16 people versus
in the thousands.
And not accepting that
we were having thousands
of victims in the island.
I say to the politicians
in the States to be careful,
and to take Puerto
Rican and Puerto Rican
respect as something serious.
We have a vote there
in the States.
