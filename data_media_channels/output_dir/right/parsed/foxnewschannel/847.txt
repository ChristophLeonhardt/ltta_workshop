HOWIE: THE MEDIA HAVE A NEW TERM
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND
DONALD TRUMP.
>> IT HAS DEINVOLVED INTO A
CULT.
>> THE PRIMARY VOTERS IN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY DEINVOLVED INTO
A CULT.
>> THIS IS JONESTOWN?
>> DONALD TRUMP IS ACCUSED OF
LEADING A CULT.
TO BELIEVE THAT CNN IS MORE A
THREAT THAN NORTH KOREA.
HOWIE: SENATOR BOB CORKER SAID
THIS COULD REPORTERS.
>> IT'S ALMOST BECOMING A
CULTISH THING.
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR ANY
PARTY TO END UP WITH A CULT-LIKE
SITUATION.
HOWIE: JOINING US, EMILY
JASHINSKY, AND CATHY AREU.
EMILY, MANY IN THE MEDIA
ADOPTING THIS LABEL THAT THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A TRUMPIAN
CULT.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT
THE JOURNALISTIC MINDSET.
EMILY: I THINK THERE IS SOME
GLEE THAT BOB CORKER GAVE THEM
THE WORD.
DO I BELIEVE THERE IS TOO MUCH
DEFERENCE TO THE PRESIDENT?
ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK IT'S TOOER TO SAY THERE
IS SOME SORT OF CULT AROUND
DONALD TRUMP.
I THINK IT'S SHORT-SIGHTED.
HOWIE: CATHY, EVEN WELL BEFORE
CORKER I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" LAST WEEK
THE CULT OF TRUMP.
NATIONAL JOURNAL LAST YEAR,
TRUMP'S CULT OVERWHELMS THE GOP.
CATHY: I GUESS THE PRESS DID IT
FIRST, BUT THE GOP JUMPED ON IT
SO THE GOP IS OWNING THIS WORD.
TRUMP DOES HAVE FOLLOWERS.
JOURNALISTS -- RIGHT-LEANING
JOURNALISTS AS GEORGE WILL WAS
TALKING TO BILL MAHER ABOUT THIS
AND SAYING IT'S NOT SO MUCH A
CULT AS A CULTURE OF FEAR.
THEY ARE DISSECTING IT AND
ANALYZING IT AND TAKE IT TO THE
NEXT LEVEL.
IS IT REALLY A CULT?
WE ARE MOVING AWAY TO THE C-WORD
AND MOVING TO ANOTHER WORD.
HOWIE: I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM
WITH THE UNDERLYING ANALYSIS
THAT MOST OF IN THE GOP FOLLOW
THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY AGREE
WITH HIP OR FEAR HIM OR FEAR
LOSING THEIR JOBS.
BUT THINK ABOUT THIS WORD CULT.
IT SUGGESTS IT'S SPOOKY.
A CULT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN IT
MUST BE MINDLESS AND DELUSIONAL.
THEY ARE USING THIS IN RELATION
TO TRUMP.
>> IT'S WHAT IT IMPLYINGS TO THE
REPUBLICANS.
THIS IS A PRESIDENT POPULAR WITH
REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
THEY ARE JUST -- I THINK THERE
IS TOO MUCH DEFERENCE SOMETIMES.
THE MEDIA IS TOO EXCITED TO USE
