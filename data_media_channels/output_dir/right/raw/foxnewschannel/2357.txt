00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,008
WE WON AN ELECTION YESTERDAY IN

00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:15,342
ARIZONA.

7
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:16,877
NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT.

8
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:18,278
THEY HAD THESE MASSIVE BOOTHS

9
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:20,380
SET UP FOR CNN AND EVERYBODY.

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,282
THEY HAD THIS BIG BOOTHS SET UP

11
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:23,450
BECAUSE THEY WERE HOPING --

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,786
THEY SPENT A FORTUNE ON THE

13
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:28,355
DEMOCRAT AND THE REPUBLICAN WON.

14
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:31,391
>> Rick: PRESIDENT TRUMP

15
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:32,159
DISCUSSING REPUBLICAN DEBBIE

FOX NEW YESTERDAY.

18
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:39,366
SHE WON BY A 5% MARGIN.

19
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,534
GIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CARRIED

20
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,736
THE DISTRICT BY 21 POINTS IN

21
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:43,036
2016.

22
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:44,271
SHOULD REPUBLICANS BE CONCERNED

23
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:46,139
AS WE APPROACH THE NOVEMBER

24
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:46,840
MID-TERM ELECTIONS.

25
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,143
JOINING US NOW IS RONNA

26
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:52,612
McDANIELS, CHAIRWOMAN OF THE

RNC.

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,713
THE CONGRESSWOMAN ELECT SAID A

29
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:55,115
WIN IS A WIN.

30
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:57,617
IT WAS JUST UNDER 5% MARGIN OF

31
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:57,951
VICTORY.

32
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:59,519
IS THAT A STORY HERE?

33
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,289
>> IT'S A HUGE WIN AND LET'S

34
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:08,829
LOOK AT THESE CONGRESSIONAL

35
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:09,329
SPECIAL ELECTIONS.

36
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,332
WE'VE WON FIVE OUT OF SIX,

37
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:13,834
100,000 LESS VOTERS TURN OUT

38
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,635
THAN IN 2016 FOR THE

39
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:17,504
PRESIDENTIAL AND YOU LOSE

40
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:17,904
INCUMBENTS.

41
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:20,841
THERE ARE OPEN SEATS WITHOUT AN

42
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,709
INCUMBENT WHICH ARE ALWAYS MORE

43
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:23,109
COMPETITIVE.

44
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:24,845
TO WIN FIVE OUT OF SIX SHOWS

45
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:26,179
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RECOGNIZE

46
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:27,414
THAT REPUBLICANS ARE DELIVERING.

47
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:29,282
THEY FEEL THE IMPACT OF THESE

48
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:29,983
TAX CUTS.

49
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:31,151
THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP, JOBS

50
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:32,786
ARE COMING BACK TO THIS COUNTRY

51
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,955
AND I FEEL VERY GOOD GOING INTO

52
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:37,123
THE MID-TERMS.

53
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:39,092
>> Rick: WITH MARGINS THINNING

54
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,060
SOME REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING

55
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,596
THEY SHOULD BE ON HIGH ALERT.

56
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:45,432
>> DON'T LISTEN TO THE

57
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:46,433
MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHO HAS A

58
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:47,534
NARRATIVE THEY WANT TO PUSH.

59
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,636
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LOWER

60
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:50,937
VOTER TURNOUT COMPARED TO A

61
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:52,839
PRESIDENTIAL YEAR AND LOOK AT

62
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,608
THE INCUMBENTS BEING GONE,

63
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,009
THESE ARE SPECIAL ELECTIONS FOR

64
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:56,376
A REASON.

65
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,844
ON DAYS WHEN PEOPLE TYPICALLY

66
00:01:57,844 --> 00:01:58,812
DON'T VOTE.

67
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:00,247
THE FACT WE'RE WINNING TIME

68
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,415
AFTER TIME AFTER TIME SHOWS

69
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,050
THAT VOTERS ARE TAKING STOCK OF

70
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,919
WHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE IN

71
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,854
CONGRESS, WHAT THIS PRESIDENT

72
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,256
HAS DONE AND THEY'RE RETURNING

73
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,157
REPUBLICANS TO CONGRESS.

74
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:12,592
>> Rick: THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE

75
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:13,760
PRESS IS IGNORING THIS WIN AND

76
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,131
THAT LEADS TO A BIGGER QUESTION.

77
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,532
ARE REPUBLICANS FACING AN

78
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,867
UPHILL BATTLE GETTING COVERAGE

79
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,569
FOR THEIR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.

80
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:23,837
>> IT'S SHAMEFUL THE PRESS

81
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:25,038
HASN'T COVERED THIS WIN.

82
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,507
IF IT WERE THE OTHER WAY AROUND

83
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:30,076
IT WOULD BE BLANKET COVERAGE

84
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:31,311
DAY AFTER DAY THE BELLWETHER OF

85
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:33,113
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER.

86
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,981
THEY WERE READY TO DO THAT AND

87
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,182
WE WON AND IT'S CRICKETS.

88
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:38,551
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHARE A

89
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,452
NARRATIVE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE

90
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,654
DELIVERING JUST LIKE THEY DON'T

91
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,756
SHARE THE FACTS OF THESE TAX

92
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:43,957
CUTS THAT OVER FOUR MILLION

93
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,825
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE

94
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,862
BENEFITED FROM BONUSES OR

95
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,964
HIGHER WAGES OR 401K INCREASES,

96
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:52,933
THAT 2/3 OF AMERICANS HAVE

97
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,200
BIGGER PAYCHECKS, ECONOMY IS

98
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:55,902
ALL THE GOOD THINGS COMING OUT

99
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:57,070
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

100
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,705
BEING COVERED AT THE LEVEL IT

101
00:02:58,705 --> 00:02:59,406
SHOULD BE.

102
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,741
GUESS WHAT, THE VOTERS ARE

103
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:02,042
SMART.

104
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,843
THEY'RE FIGURING IT OUT AND WHY

105
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,646
WE'VE WON FIVE OUT OF SIX

106
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,548
SPECIALS HEADING INTO AN

107
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:11,418
IMPORTANT MID-TERM TO KEEP OUR

108
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:11,952
MAJORITIES.

109
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:15,622
>> Rick: NOW YOU HAVE PEACE IN

110
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:17,290
KOREA AND PERHAPS SOLIDIFY THE

111
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,757
BASE.

112
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,626
>> ISIS ON THE RUN.

113
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:20,226
MILITARY BEING FUNDED.

114
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,761
AMERICA IS A LEADER IN THE

115
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,929
WORLD AND A PRESIDENT DOESN'T

116
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,331
BLINK WHEN HE IS CHALLENGED.

117
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:26,900
THAT HAS CHANGED THE DYNAMIC

118
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,071
AND HE HAS RESTORED AMERICA AS

119
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,673
THE COUNTRY WITH THE BIG STICK.

120
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,308
WE AREN'T GOING TO BLINK WHEN

121
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,776
YOU CHALLENGE US AND LOOK NOW

122
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:37,978
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NORTH

123
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,779
KOREA.

124
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,681
>> Rick: ARE YOU FACING A DAILY

125
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,516
FRUSTRATION TO GET YOUR MESSAGE

126
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,151
OUT IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA?

127
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,586
>> I'M NOT.

128
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,455
WE KNEW THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA

129
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:49,756
WASN'T GOING TO BE OUR FRIEND

130
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,257
AND UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULTS OF

131
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:53,626
THE ELECTION AND WE'VE SEEN

132
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,794
THAT WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED

133
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,663
NEGATIVE COVERAGE OF THIS

134
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:57,030
PRESIDENT.

135
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,264
THE RNC HAS RAISED DOUBLE THE

136
00:03:58,264 --> 00:03:59,532
MONEY AND TRAINED MORE

137
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,401
VOLUNTEERS WE DID IN THE 2016

138
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:01,701
CYCLE.

139
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,503
WE ARE ON THE GROUND IN 25

140
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:03,970
STATES.

141
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,138
WE'LL TAKE THE MESSAGE DIRECTLY

142
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,340
TO THE VOTERS AND GOING TO

143
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,675
BYPASS WHAT THEY HEAR IN THE

144
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:09,142
MEDIA.

145
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:10,777
AS WE TAKE THE MESSAGE TO THE

146
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:12,412
VOTERS IT IS RESONATING AND

147
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:13,613
PLEASED WHERE THIS ECONOMY IS

148
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:14,781
AND PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT AND

149
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,649
WHAT HE IS DOING TO CARE ABOUT

150
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,051
THAT AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY

151
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,152
AND THEY KNOW THAT DEMOCRATS

152
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:19,918
HAVE LOST THEIR WAY.

153
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,322
>> Rick: YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

154
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:25,325
THAT THE PRESIDENT WON THAT

155
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:26,726
DISTRICT BY 21% AND THIS

156
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,628
CANDIDATE WON IT BY 5%.

157
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:31,431
YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

158
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:33,533
>> 130,000 LESS VOTERS TURNED

159
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:33,800
OUT.

160
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,869
YOU CAN'T DO APPLES TO APPLES.

161
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:38,238
IF IT WAS THE SAME TURNOUT AS A

162
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:39,172
PRESIDENTIAL YEAR, FINE.

163
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:41,508
IT IS A MUCH LOWER TURNOUT

164
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,977
BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL ELECTION.

165
00:04:43,977 --> 00:00:00,000
THE PRESIDENT WOULD WIN THAT
