so great to see you again what do you make of the March for our lives March for lives it's a riff off of the phrase March for life I think which is a big abortion anti-abortion protest that never gets a fraction of this coverage well it's part of this snowflake ization of youth politics in this country where you've convinced young people that their lives are at stake actually they're not school shootings are not actually increasing and the question we're talking about here isn't a matter of life on one side and death on the other there are people who would argue that a stronger Second Amendment is actually the best thing for protecting life and as we saw at the high school in Maryland last week where a security officer engaged shot and killed a student who came to school to shoot other people that is the only reliable way to stop these things from happening so you don't want to restrict the Second Amendment if you actually care about life what this was really was an extension of the anti-trump movement it was like the women's March it was like the me2 marches that have happened where they've taken a legitimate public issue let's say in the case of me - question of sexual harassment ironically in liberal Hollywood and they've turned it into a mobilizing force for the anti-trump demonstrators around the country as a whole so it's true that a lot of young people are getting engaged and involved but if you look at the polling data on this only a plurality of younger people want more gun control and there is a smaller number a minority but not a non insignificant one that believes in strong protections for the Second Amendment so this is not what is being portrayed on television as an entirely majority view that everybody agrees that we have to impose gun controls in the country what these children who have been elevated to positions of leadership beyond their maturity don't understand is that the reason we haven't resolved the question of gun violence is that it's actually very tricky and confiscating guns is not an option banning guns is not an option and the fact is that where we have the most gun control in this country is also where we have the most violence as Newt Gingrich pointed out on the weekend most of the gun murders in this country occur in five metropolitan areas and those are also cities and have the toughest gun laws so this is not an easy issue to sort out and the fact that we're being lectured and hectored by people and told that if you don't stand with them you want to kill children that's running the risk of provoking another backlash and if Republican voters become convinced that a Democratic Congress will take away their gun rights he marched for our lives may actually have mobilized as many if not more Republican voters than they did Democrats that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
