1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,080
REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF
STATE, FOR SOME REASON IS

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,530
REFUSING $60 MILLION THAT HAS
BEEN ALLOCATED TO HELP MITIGATE

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,769
THE PROPAGANDA BY RUSSIANS THAT
IS COMING HERE TO THE UNITED

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:14,769
STATES.

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,450
IT'S REALLY STRANGE.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,120
LET
ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS ON WHAT

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW --

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,410
>>-- I APOLOGIZE, IT'S ACTUALLY
$80 MILLION --

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:38,089
>>THE TERRORIST PROPAGANDA THEY
WANT TO FIGHT IS ACTUALLY ISIS

10
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:42,079
MESSAGING THAT IS SEEPING INTO
AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,079
THEY ARE

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,180
USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN ORDER TO
RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS, IT'S A BIG

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,000
PROBLEM, THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FEAR

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,109
MONGERING ABOUT THAT FOR SOME
TIME, SO WHY IS IT THAT $80

15
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:56,969
MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO
HELP FIGHT THAT AND REX

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:05,570
TILLERSON HASN'T TAKEN THEM UP
ON THAT OFFER?

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,030
WELL --

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,290
>>THIS IS THE ORGANIZATION THAT
HAS THE MONEY, THEY KEEP TRYING

19
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,470
TO CONTACT TILLERSON AND URGE
HIM TO USE IT FOR WHAT IT'S

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:44,740
ALLOCATED 

21
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
FOR --

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,530
>>AGAIN, RUSSIA BEING ONE OF
THEM.

23
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,000
HE IS JUST LIKE, WHATEVER.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,060
OH, YEAH, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
ISIS AND RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION,

25
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,370
I GUESS I WILL GET TO IT AT SOME
POINT.

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,950
>>AS USUAL THE PRESS IS GOING
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO PRESENT

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,150
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES AS TO
WHY THIS MIGHT BE HAPPENING.

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,889
MAYBE HE IS JUST DISORGANIZED.

29
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,310
HE WAS BROUGHT IN BECAUSE HE'S

30
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,650
THE CEO OF A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY,
THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT IS TO BE

31
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,130
ABLE TO MANAGE WELL.

32
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,659
THIS IS NOT
LIKE OH GOLLY, I COULDN'T MANAGE

33
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:24,849
WELL, THE ONE THING I COULDN'T
APPROVE WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD

34
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,799
WORK AGAINST THE RUSSIANS, THE
ONES WHO GAVE ME A MEDAL, AND

35
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,879
THAT I HAD A $500 MILLION DEAL
WITH BEFORE I BECAME SECRETARY

36
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,939
OF STATE.

37
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,700
IF YOU ARE A
PROGRESSIVE OR A CONSERVATIVE

38
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,920
AND WORRIED ABOUT THE GLOBAL
ENGAGEMENT CENTER, AND THEY ARE

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,980
TRYING TO COUNTERACT THE
PROPAGANDA THAT ISIS AND RUSSIA

40
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,400
IS DOING, BUT YOU SAY WE
SHOULDN'T BE DOING PROPAGANDA

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,269
EITHER, WHAT IF THEY TURN IT
AGAINST THE U.S. -- THOSE ARE

42
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,650
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS.

43
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,409
BUT IF WE
ARE GOING TO COUNTER INFORMATION

44
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,019
FROM ANYONE IN THE WORLD I WOULD
IMAGINE IT WOULD BE ISIS, AND

45
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,290
GIVEN WHAT RUSSIA DID IN THESE
ELECTIONS, THEY CERTAINLY DID A

46
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,219
PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AND
MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN INSIDE

47
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,779
THE UNITED STATES, NO ONE
INCLUDING ALL OF THE

48
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:17,709
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DISAGREE
WITH THAT, WHETHER YOU THINK

49
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,000
THAT'S ACTIONABLE AGAINST TRUMP
IS ANOTHER QUESTION BUT RUSSIA

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,349
DEFINITELY DID IT, THOSE WOULD
BE THE TOP TWO TARGETS OF

51
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,599
COUNTERATTACKS FOR
DISINFORMATION GOING ACROSS

52
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,599
THE WORLD, SO IF YOU DON'T
AUTHORIZE THAT YOU MUST

53
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,209
HAVE A DIFFERENT REASON.

54
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,890
>>THEY ARE NOT EVEN GOOD AT
HIDING WHAT THE REAL REASON IS.

55
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,109
LET'S HEAR FROM TILLERSON AIDE
R.C.

56
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,609
HAMMOND -- THIS IS NOT SOME

57
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,939
PROGRESSIVE OR LIBERAL WHO HATES
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IT IS

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:58,689
TILLERSON'S AIDE -- HE SAID
ANY ATTEMPTS TO COUNTERACT

59
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,849
RUSSIAN MEDIA INFLUENCE WOULD
ANGER MOSCOW.

60
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:10,200
>>YOU CAN'T GET CLEARER THAN
THAT.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO ANGER

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,609
MOSCOW.

63
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,510
THEY ONLY DID A MASSIVE
MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN DURING

64
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,240
OUR ELECTION, WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO ANGER THEM.

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
THERE WAS A STORY

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,410
THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK SAYING
TILLERSON MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE

67
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,430
SOON.

68
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,720
HE JUST GOT THERE, WHY
WOULD HE WANT TO LEAVE?

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
AND THE

70
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,370
GULLIBLE PRESS IS LIKE, HIS
AIDES AND PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM

71
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,229
ARE SAYING MAYBE HE'S FRUSTRATED
WITH TRUMP AND THE CHAOS IN THE

72
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,229
WHITE HOUSE -- NO, HIS WHOLE
POINT WAS TO GET THE SANCTIONS

73
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,229
LIFTED.

74
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,310
NOT ONLY WAS IT A $500
MILLION DEAL WITH RUSSIA THAT

75
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,569
EXXON MOBIL DID, THE REVENUE IS
UP TO POTENTIALLY $9 TRILLION.

76
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:57,570
500 MILLION IS JUST THE
INVESTMENT YOU NEED TO START THE

77
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,570
DEAL.

78
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,090
HE IS LIKE, I CAME HERE
FOR THE $9 TRILLION, IF I'M NOT

79
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,970
GETTING IT -- AND WHY DID THEY
PUT THAT STATEMENT OUT LAST

80
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,660
WEEK?

81
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,190
LAST WEEK IS WHEN THE
VOTES CAME IN WITH THE HOUSE AND

82
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,800
SENATE SAY WE AREN'T GOING TO
LIFT THE SANCTIONS UNDER ANY

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
CIRCUMSTANCES.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,740
ALL OF A SUDDEN
TILLERSON IS LIKE, I FORGOT

85
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,319
ABOUT MY LUNCH APPOINTMENT --

86
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,860
MAYBE I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO
DO.

87
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,300
>>THIS IS A DISASTER, AND KEEP
IN MIND THAT THERE ARE STILL

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,460
MANY LEADERSHIP ROLES IN THE
STATE DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE GONE

89
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,629
UNFILLED BECAUSE OF THE
INCOMPETENCE AND THE FACT THAT

90
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:44,460
TILLERSON HAD NO INTEREST IN
THIS JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE.

91
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
HE

92
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,660
MIGHT WANT TO USE IT TO HIS
ADVANTAGE, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING

93
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,979
OUT FOR HIM BECAUSE CONGRESS IS
FINALLY STEPPING UP.

94
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:53,979
BUT IN THIS

95
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,819
CASE YOU HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS AT YOUR DISPOSAL, YOU

96
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,360
COULD FIGHT BACK AGAINST
PROPAGANDA.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,680
YOU WANT TO LOOK OUT

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,770
FOR YOUR RUSSIAN BUDDIES, THAT'S
ONE THING.

99
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,770
WHICH I THINK IT'S

100
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,560
RIDICULOUS AND UNDEMOCRATIC.

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,530
BUT
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO COMBAT

102
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,770
ISIS RECRUITING WITHIN THIS
COUNTRY, WHY AREN'T YOU USING

103
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,770
THAT MONEY?

104
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,990
IT'S STRANGE.

105
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,229
FINALLY I WANT TO STATE THAT $60

106
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,949
MILLION THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED
TOWARD THIS EFFORT IS SET

107
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,960
TO EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER 30,

108
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,420
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT WILL
HAPPEN AFTER THAT.

109
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,110
IT COULD GO TO THE STATE
DEPARTMENT BY THEM, OR THEY

110
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,280
COULD BE ABLE TO SAVE IT FOR
NEXT YEAR, I DON'T KNOW.

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
UNCLEAR.

112
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,220
>>IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO
USED IF THEY DON'T ASK IT BY

113
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,720
SEPTEMBER 30.

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,100
IF THEY DO, IT'S
NOT CLEAR IF THEY HAVE TO SPEND

115
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
IT BY THEN.

116
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,789
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE
IS TILLERSON APPEARS TO BE

117
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,539
RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK BECAUSE IF
THEY DON'T ASK FOR IT BY

118
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,840
SEPTEMBER 30 THEY ALMOST
CERTAINLY WON'T GET IT.

119
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
THEN HE

120
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,389
COULD TURN AROUND AND GO I GUESS
I MISMANAGED THAT, WE CAN'T

121
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,819
SPEND $60 MILLION CORRECTING THE
MISINFORMATION MY FRIENDS ARE

122
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,259
PUTTING OUT THERE ON RUSSIA,
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT TO

123
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,180
ANGER THEM, PLUS THEY GOT US
INTO OFFICE.

124
00:07:12,180 --> 00:00:00,000
>>REPUBLICANS, REAL STRONG ON
NATIONAL SECURITY.
