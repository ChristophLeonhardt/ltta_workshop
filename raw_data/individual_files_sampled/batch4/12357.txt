intentionally or unintentionally people who are being led to believe that indulgences in pain for their sins in some monetary way or through works was how they were going to gain salvation and that completely maligned the process of Christ and Martin Luther raise awareness about that and for that I'm extremely think there is I will I will grant he did change over time but he did change over time so earlier on he was a little bit better more of a reformer than late later on all of the anti-semitic comments came later in his life they weren't they didn't come earlier in his life however let's not forget that he did add that first Sola that only faith from Romans he added that and and in subsequent translations if it was of course Ali be a little bit holier act a little bit better if that was the case you would have been totally fine with the Pharisees because the Pharisees were the holiest of them all but obviously it wasn't about works it was about faith of course but I think it's a straw man I don't see anywhere in church teaching where the Catholic Church has ever taught that through works you will earn your salvation the church explicitly didn't call that a heresy that's the heresy of Pelagius in the 4th or 5th century v and we do know i'm certain of course Christ's sacrifice was perfect but let's not forget that that Christ says to Peter Peter you are this your Arak on this rock I'll build my church here are the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven he also said there will be many who come to me and say Lord Lord who will not see the kingdom of heaven and of course James says faith without works is dead actually will not enter the kingdom of heaven because what Martin Luther did if she said this is not about your external proof of what you are saved or not this is about your heart and I'm not saying the entirety of the Catholic faith faith preaches otherwise but he felt where he was that that was the trend that was going on at least the people in the Catholic Church we're starting to focus too much on the outer works and not enough on true repentance in their heart and that's exactly what Martin Luther came to refocus the church on was focusing on the heart transformation that grace through faith actually accomplishes because you're right faith without works is dead but works without faith is nothing sure what the when is the Catholic Church ever taught otherwise when does the Catholic Church ever taught that you'll earn your way to heaven through works I don't I don't deny that there were corrupt professional partners obviously as many Pope's condemned them explicitly but if Martin Luther's problem was with some local bishops and some local priests selling heaven they were trying to sell heaven to ignorant people then then that's a political conversation that's not a theologist refuge how he just said that the the issue is the issue is instead of saying okay Luther Martin Luther we'll look this over we'll talk about this he was persecuted for coming to his art archbishop and saying these things he was brought and told to say mayor Copa before him and instead of and instead of doing that he stood his ground and of course like as you said years later he seemed to become a little bit embittered but let's not forget that's a statement sure yeah well as my as I'm saying you know it was because Catholic mobs attacked his followers and and burned them at the stake and stoned them well if anybody was a proponent of burning at the stake I think we would all agree that Martin Luther was a was a proponent sure and I'm not gonna defend Martin Luther in his entirety after all if there was one thing Catholics and Protestants were united and it was the persecution of the early evangelicals of course they weren't called that back then but you know that exactly what alia said it's more about bye-bye faith alone and standing up to the corruption of his day you know I will bring up this point though because I am sympathetic to a lot of these poor Protestant arguments and I do like a lot of Protestant theologians and apologists but it there is this one sticking point because the the question here especially with Luther is is the church the church is the Pope in the Petrine line in the line of Peter and did Christ Institute a real church on earth with a real clergy and real buildings and real windows in real places or is it a strictly an ethereal sort of thing that floats about and does not have real clergy and real windows and things like that and it just seems to me that you know in a religion which is based on a fact it's not based on a philosophy it's based on a fact the incarnation of the Divine logos into a particular person in through a particular mother in a particular place in a particular time where he performed particularly Racal Zinn space and time on real people and then literally was killed by someone named Pontius Pilate and then was a literally resurrected stayed around for six weeks and then ascended into heaven that it makes sense to me that that guy would have picked twelve real people to be the apostles and when he said I establish a church would have established a real institution on earth it's it's hard for me to get beyond that and to think that really there was there's a there's all fact a unity of the symbol and the symbolized of the logos and the Creator in the creation but then it just becomes if you're real after that
