welcome back the Supreme Court has spoken on the president's so-called travel ban so what comes next joining me now is Democratic senator mazie Hirono she is the senior senator from Hawaii that is the state they brought the lawsuit on the president's travel order that resulted in today's developments senator thank you for joining us I know and we played some of your clips of what you were saying earlier today I know you're critical of this ruling one thing you said that jumped out at me you liken the decision by the Supreme Court today to an infamous decision by the Supreme Court back in 1994 that authorized the internment of japanese-americans during the Second World War in making that comparison do you think that is where this could end up but do you think that the Supreme Court has given this president or any president the power to do something similar with Muslims that's my fear and in fact the court said under the Immigration and Nationality Act that mr. president you can just do pretty much whatever you want just so long as you deem it to be in the interest of national security and you don't have overt things like this is a Muslim ban although he was so overt about it throughout the campaign and even after that he wanted to prevent Muslims from coming to this country and the court said we're not going to consider all of that whereas of course the dissent a very strong dissent by justice Sotomayor said to the contrary this is very much like the Korematsu decision where the government came in and said the president justified his actions by saying this is for national security I think it's quite reminiscent and I say who's next is he gonna ban Mexicans from coming to our country people from Guatemala people from Honduras I think the president is feeling pretty powerful right now and we hardly need to give him more power more part to a president who does not limit himself to the rule of law or due process or anything much else that promotes democracy in our country let me ask you because the ruling from the court here in John Roberts in the opinion he says I'll read from it the proclamation meaning the travel ban the proclamation is squarely within the scope of presidential authority so the argument that the majority and the court was making here was they would take no position on Trump's motivation for it just saying that he was exercising legitimate presidential authority under the law is there a thought on your part in response as a lawmaker to change the law pretty much the court said if you don't like our interpretation of how why they latitude is to the president under the appropriate act then you the members of Congress can change that as though we have an environment where this Congress is going to do anything positive regarding immigration so I say this is a dark day for our country for anybody who cares about checks and balances because notice that the person who gave the supreme court the fifth vote on this was none other than Neal Gorsuch and if he looked at the tweet that Mitch McConnell sent out it was of him shaking hands with Neil Gorsuch so by preventing Merrick garland from even getting a hearing and putting Neal Gorsuch on the court that is the fifth vote not only for this decision which I think history will deem was an error but probably another decision that will be come down the pike tomorrow relating to public sector unions new course which will probably give the court the fifth vote on that decision also let me let me just stay on this focus I'm trying to understand your interpretation of your view of presidential power as it relates to this case if we took a future president it's not Donald Trump I don't know if it's a Republican I don't know if it's a Democrat I don't know anything about this future president but if a future president asserted that I as the president have the power to make a determination that the following three or four countries have absolutely you know unacceptable vetting procedures and therefore until those vetting procedures are addressed I'm not going to allow entries to the United States from those countries would that future president do you think that future president has that power the error of this Court's decision was that they did not take into consideration the true motives for this iteration of the Muslim ban and the true motive being a Muslim ban and so you can quote it any way you want you can try to to sugarcoat it I should say by saying well this is actually for some other reasons so the courts saying that whatever the president says it to justify what he's doing has no impact on their decision at all so that is a very broad broad reading of the powers that the president has to do whatever the heck he wants under the rubic of national security and what I would say that the dissenters looked at which was the totality of the comments and the statements that can lead one to conclude that the real desire was for a Muslim ban which should be unconstitutional as being based on religion do you think there's in the argument you're making though the idea of hey look yeah he said this as a candidate he said this on the campaign trail let's match this up with the action he tried to take his president and see if we can we can see clearly what the what the true motivation was there is there any kind of slippery slope potential though in that sort of thing where if on a different issue not necessarily immigration not necessarily a travel ban where if you start trying to match up what a president a presidential candidate says in the trail with what they do are you getting into an area that we're trying to discern motives I think it's really important to discern they it's not just motives that they were just making up it's actually utterances and explanation explanations as to his actions that the president myself came out of his own mouth so when we totally ignore that I think that we are getting into the realm of a slippery slope and in fact of the the slippery slope with this decision is that the president can target some other group some other country next say this is for national security reasons that I'm doing this so there's a slippery slope you know and just about any case that you can think of but in this case where the presidential power is basically unfettered I think that creates more of a dangerous slippery slope than them saying wait a minute mr. president you said all these things that you wanted to impose a Muslim ban and this is not constitutional we are not going to allow you to do that that would have been a much better ruling in my opinion that would have set some parameters so that we don't get on a slippery slope this decision creates the opening for the very kind of slippery slope that you're probably referring to Steve all right senator mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii thank you hello youtubers if you're
