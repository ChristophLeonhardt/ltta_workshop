1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,299
Political rookie Emmanuel Macron has swept
to victory in the French Presidential Elections

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,000
pledging to unify the country and reinvigorate
the economy.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,820
The 39-year old is the first President from
outside the two traditional main parties

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,670
since the modern republic's foundation.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,420
His centrist, pro-European, open-border views
stand in stark contrast

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,400
to the rising voices of Europe's resurgent
far right.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,480
This is how Macron’s unabashed ambition
drove him from star pupil, to banker, to political rebel

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,700
and now President of France

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,340
Macron was raised in the town of Amiens, two
hours north of Paris

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,350
This is the house he grew up in.

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,920
The eldest of three children from a family
of doctors, he attended a Jesuit school.

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,560
A precocious kid, he preferred the company
of teachers to other pupils.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,820
And it was at school that he met his future
wife.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,120
Brigitte Auziere was coach of the drama club.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,459
They worked closely together to re-write a
school production

16
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,700
He was 16. She was 40, and married with three
children

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:17,079
Gossip about their relationship began to spread
and Macron left Amiens to finish high school

18
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,249
at an elite establishment in Paris.

19
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:25,939
Auziere followed later to teach.
The pair married when Macron was 30.

20
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,229
After school he attended university in Paris,
studying Philosophy,

21
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:35,140
then went to the prestigious National School
of Administration, a breeding ground for the

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,200
French elite.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,549
He works for four years as a high level bureaucrat
at the Ministry of Economy,

24
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,479
before moving to the renowned investment bank
Rothschild.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Macron was quickly parachuted into managing
a massive acquisition

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,560
When the deal went through, he got a big payout.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,179
Then in 2012 Macron was offered a position
working with the new president

28
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:06,959
and a personal friend, Francois Hollande.

29
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,340
Two years later, Hollande gave him the prestigious
position of Minister of Economy.

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,820
He was 36.

31
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,560
But by now Hollande’s public approval rating
had fallen to historic lows.

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,080
Macron threw himself into a plan to loosen
economic regulation… With testy exchanges

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,340
in parliament.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,000
But the reforms were disliked and the legislation
had to be forced through parliament, sparking

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,600
protest.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,209
Macron increasingly criticised the government
but still enjoyed the president's support.

37
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,960
Then last year he launched his own political
movement - En Marche, or On the Move,

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,840
thrusting him into the national spotlight.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,860
That's Mark Deen

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,480
The youthful contender was seen as a presidential
long shot

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,959
But borrowing from US President Barack Obama’s
election playbook,

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,600
he took to social media and ran a large grass-roots
campaign.

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,980
By the time France went to the polls for the
first round of voting in April he had successfully

44
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,280
reinvented himself.

45
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,080
He was no longer the free market reformer
working under a failed President... but a

46
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,260
new voice in politics.

47
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,240
He secured the most votes of any candidate
in

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,459
the first round, putting him into a runoff
with another political outsider,

49
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,330
the far-right Marine Le Pen.

50
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,799
With voters facing the choice between a pro-EU
centrist and an far-right candidate who wants

51
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,670
to pull France out of the union

52
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,070
Macron successfully pulled in support from
both the moderate left and right.

53
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,720
He won with a resounding majority - taking
over 66% of the vote to Le Pen’s 34.

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,760
But with this party unlikely to form a majority
in the next parliament,

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,470
and a policy agenda straddling ideas from
both side of the political spectrum,

56
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,080
Maron’s success now depends on building
bridges with the traditional parties he has

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:00:00,000
defeated.
