This is one of Rwanda's
reconciliation villages,
where perpetrators and victims
of the country's genocide
live side by side.
At least 800,000 people were
killed during 100 days
of violence that began in April
of 1994 when the country's
Hutu ethnic majority targeted
their Tutsi neighbors.
But 23 years later, the
country has formalized the
reconciliation process in
villages like this.
Jacqueline Mukamana and
Mathias Sendegeya are two
of these unlikely neighbors.
Children are taught a
state-mandated reconciliation
curriculum from a young age.
On this day, their assignment
was to describe their
hopes for the future.
On this morning, the entire
village is taking part in a day
of mandatory community service,
known as Umuganda,
to instill a sense of
cooperation and work to rebuild
the nation.
Here, the residents
are digging a
drainage ditch to prevent homes
in the community from flooding.
While the adults work, the
children gather to play and
performed a traditional dance.
For a new generation
being raised
in an inclusive community,
these children identify first
as Rwandan.
