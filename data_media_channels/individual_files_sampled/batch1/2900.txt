if Putin likes Donald Trump guess what folks that's called an asset not a liability now I don't know that I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin I hope I do but there's a good chance I won't and if I don't do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me does anybody in this room really believe that give me a break I have no dealings with Russia I have no deals in Russia I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we've stayed away and I have no loans with Russia we could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict so I have no loans no dealings and no current pending deals
