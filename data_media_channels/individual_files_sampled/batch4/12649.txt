all right we're gonna talk about president Trump's new executive order but before we do we are honored to have one of the most famous and most respected people in the world to address the question of whether countries should build walls on their borders yes Aristotle is here not Aristotle but a little bust of Aristotle because obviously our soul has been dead for like thousands of years but he was so eager to be here he just said California or bust he's a nevermind here is Aristotle in his famous book politics has translated from the Greek by Spencer Clavin because the Greek is all like Greek and stuff so here's Aristotle some people say city-states that are trying for virtue should not have walls but those people's beliefs are out of date they can see proof of that for themselves by looking at what happens to other city-states that put on that kind of display true enough when your enemies are evenly matched and similar in number it's not the best thing to rely on the strength of your walls for safety but sometimes there are just too many attackers for human beings to fight back with virtue alone and so if we want to be safe from disaster and embarrassment we have to make up our minds that the best thing for war is to have the strongest most secure walls asking city-states not to put up walls is like trying to make your territory an easy target by flattening all its hilly terrain or like not even putting up walls around a private citizens house because you think the people who live there will become cowards and we shouldn't forget city-states that put up walls can use them in two ways they can act as if they had walls and as if they didn't city-states without walls can't do that so in fact people shouldn't just put up walls around their city-states they should also work hard to make sure that those walls are as beautiful as the city-state deserves the Trump love will that be a beautiful law that the wall to meet every military need attackers work hard to find out how they can gain the upper hand and defenders should work just as hard a defense they should use state-of-the-art interventions and they should study and try to prevent new technology of their own after all people don't even try to attack opponents who are well prepared to begin with Thank You Aristotle air welcome all right that was me doing an Aristotle voice but the rest was actually Aristotle truly
