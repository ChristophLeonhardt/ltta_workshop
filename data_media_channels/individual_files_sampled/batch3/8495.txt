SO, MR. PRESIDENT, LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN RULED BY FEAR AND ANGER AND UNDERHANDED GAMESMANSHIP FOR TOO LONG. TIME FOR US TO STAND UP TO THIS KIND OF THING. WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THESE TACTICS. WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO UNDERSCORE THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. IT'S THE SENATE THAT IS ON TRIAL HERE, MR. PRESIDENT. WHAT KIND OF IMAGE WILL WE CONVEY TO THE PUBLIC? CAN WE BE SCARED BY ALL THESE PEOPLE RAMPAGING THROUGH THE HALLS ACCOSTING MEMBERS AT AIRPORTS, COMING TO THEIR HOMES? THEY'RE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THE SENATE INTO DEFEATING A GOOD MAN. ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN? IN THIS COUNTRY? SO WE WILL NOT PRETEND THAT PARTISAN HISTORY ONICS TAKE AWAY THE BASIC FAIRNESS EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES.

AND A BLAITENT ATTEMPT TO DECIDE ON THE PART OF SOME SENATE DEMOCRATS THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE NO LONGER APPLIES IN THIS COUNTRY? WHAT KIND OF PERSON COULDN'T HAVE BEEN UPSET ABOUT THAT? THEY CLAIM HE SPOKE TOO FORCEFULLY IN DEFENSE OF HIMSELF? AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF SUCH OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR THAT CANNOT BE PROVEN? I ADMIRE HIM FOR STANDING UP FOR HIMSELF AND STANDING UP FOR HIS FAMILY. I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF IT WERE NOT DONE IN AN AGGRESSIVE FASHION. FOR GOODNESS SAKE. SO LET'S RECLAIM THIS MOMENT FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE, A CHANCE TO ELEVATE A STUNNINGLY TALENTED AND IMPRESSIVE JURIST TO AN IMPORTANT OFFICE FOR WHICH HE IS SO WELL QUALIFIED. SO COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY QUALIFIED. A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE OUR GREAT NATION PRECISELY THE KIND OF BRILLIANT, FAIR MINDED AND COLLEGIAL SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT THE COURT DESERVES. THIS, MR. PRESIDENT, IS THE GOOD THAT SENATORS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO GOOD HERE. AND TO UNDERSCORE THE BASIC TENET OF FAIRNESS IN OUR COUNTRY. SO I FILE CLOTURE ON THE
