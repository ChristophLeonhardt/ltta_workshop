the Values Voters summit is organized by the Family Research Council a Christian evangelical group that says its goal is to defend family values and religious liberties in practice the group is best known for its attacks on Muslims and the gay community the Southern Poverty Law Center which monitors right-wing groups in the u.s. calls it a hate group either way it represents an integral part of Donald Trump space we are now officially in session white Christian evangelicals long ago put aside their skepticism of Donald Trump's godliness because he pledged to nominate justices to the Supreme Court of the United States who would rule in favor of Christian fundamentalist belief 80% voted for him in the election and loyalty to Trump remains high but there is a feeling among Christian evangelical leaders that Republican members of Congress aren't doing enough to protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh from attack he's accused of drunkenly sexually assaulting a young girl when he was 17 at a party in the early 80s I thought he might inadvertently kill me Christine Blasi fall said Cavanaugh denies the allegation and here at the Values Voter Summit support for Cavanaugh remained solid if you walked in anywhere and said I have I want to report a a sexual assault yes ma'am when did this happen 36 years ago excuse me 36 years ago yes do you have any eyewitnesses well there are two witnesses but they both deny it happened are you concerned about the allegations of sexual assault not that much anymore because the Republicans have to stand up for something and that's what the Republican leadership fears they're already nervous about low turnout if the Trump base believes the president's claims that the Republicans will sweep the upcoming midterm elections buoyed by his brilliant performance the polls suggest otherwise and now if they lose the favor of reliable voters like these evangelicals it will be a disaster which is why they're pushing for a swift confirmation vote and very near future judge Cavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court but the risk for Republicans is that if Cavanaugh is confirmed without seeming to have a fair hearing or investigation into the allegations it will enrage and energize independent and women voters to turn out in force in November against them she Everett ANSI al-jazeera Washington
