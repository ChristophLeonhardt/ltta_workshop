so last week some very tolerant individual threw bricks into the office windows of the Nebraska Republican Party and wrote abolished ice on the sidewalk in front which prestigious professor had absolutely no sympathy for this political violence let's find out it's my honor to introduce you to City University of New York professor Angus Johnston who describes himself as a historian and advocate of American student activism would it be redundant to say left-wing student activism there anyway Angus had a few things to say about the Vandal who threw bricks into the office of the Nebraska Republican Party causing 1,200 dollars in damage he said police are looking to question a giant cartoon kitty cat and then a giant Republican kitty cat given the glass spray pattern okay so sure the hole left by the bricks did resemble a cat but why a Republican cat unless you're suggesting this was a hoax if so I've got news for you Angus one side of the political spectrum is infamous for making hoaxes and it's not the right the professor then went on to post would appear to be a text message exchange he had with a friend pretty amazing that a GOP window was smashed and Democrats didn't start a GoFundMe in seconds the dude says to Angus honestly the most hopeful sign I've seen in months the professor replies captioning the tweet with hashtag good news Thursday and I'm sure Angus would feel the exact same way if this happened to a Democrat office because as we all know these guys aren't hypocrites or anything now to their credit the Nebraska Democrat Party did condemn the political violence but back to the professor he has a rather nuanced view on an Tifa which seems like the best you can get from leftist the right disavows it's bad actors but the left not so much one thing I've heard a lot in response to my Aunt Aoife tweets is that there's a bright line between legitimate and illegitimate violence the professor says if your claim is that a position of strict non-violence is the only way to achieve social change then I'm gonna need to work and if you don't see a messy wrenching moral middle ground between justified and unjustified violence then let's keep talking how about this Angus if you're physically attacked it is justified for you to physically defend yourself and I emphasize the word physically on purpose ideas that hurt your feelings do not equal physical violence as for the professor's desire to keep talking well that doesn't really seem to apply to people who don't share his views I emailed him for comment he didn't email me back but instead took to Twitter saying I want to write a hit piece on you but I don't understand what you said would you explain it to me my favorite kind of incoming email well Angus I don't want to be held accountable as a professor for my asinine remarks so I won't actually respond to comment requests but just tweet about them is my favorite kind of sub tweet for campus unmasked I'm Rob shamrock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm you
