THE HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WAS
QUESTIONING JEFF SESSIONS,
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS
AS PART OF ITS INVESTIGATION
INTO POSSIBLE RUSSIAN MEDDLING
IN THE ELECTION AND THIS WAS AN
INTERESTING HEARING CONSIDERING
SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE
NOW KNOW REGARDING SOME
CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEERS, CAMPAIGN
STAFFERS AND THE
COMMUNICATIONS THEY HAD WITH THE
RUSSIANS.
SO COURSE THERE IS THE PALM IN A
FOUR ANGLE.
THERE IS THE FACT THAT GEORGE
PAPADOPOULOS HAS ADMITTED
GUILT ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW THE
FULL DETAILS OF WHAT HE HAS
AND HAS NOT ADMITTED TO.
WHAT IS SESSIONS TAKE ON THIS?
IS HE CHANGING HIS STORY A
LITTLE BIT FROM PREVIOUS
HEARINGS IN THE PREVIOUS
TESTIMONY THAT HE HAS GIVEN?
FIRST, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
HIS ANSWERS REGARDING
PAPADOPOULOS AND PAGE CARTER.
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS RECENT
NEWS REPORTS REGARDING MEETINGS
DURING THE CAMPAIGN ATTENDED BY
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS AND CARTER
PAGE, AMONG OTHERS.
FRANKLY, I HAD NO RECOLLECTION
OF THIS MEETING UNTIL I SAW
THESE NEWS REPORTS.
I DO NOW RECALL THAT THE MARCH
2016 MEETING AT THE TRUMP
HOTEL THAT MR.
PAPADOPOULOS
ATTENDED BUT I HAVE NO CLEAR
RECOLLECTION OF THE DETAILS OF
WHAT HE SAID AT THAT MEETING.
AFTER READING HIS ACCOUNTS AND
TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION,
I BELIEVE THAT I WANTED TO MAKE
CLEAR TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT
AUTHORIZE TO REPRESENT THE
CAMPAIGN WITH THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER FOREIGN
GOVERNMENT FOR THAT MATTER BUT I
DID NOT RECALL THIS EVENT WHICH
OCCURRED 18 MONTHS BEFORE MY
TESTIMONY OF A FEW WEEKS AGO AND
I WOULD GLADLY HAVE REPORTED IT
HAD I REMEMBERED IT BECAUSE I
PUSH BACK AGAINST HIS SUGGESTION
THAT I THOUGHT MAY HAVE BEEN
IMPROPER.
AS FOR MR.
PAGE, WHILE I DO
NOT CHALLENGE HIS RECOLLECTION,
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF HIS PRESENCE
AT A DINNER AT THE CAPITOL HILL
CLUB OR ANY PASSING CONVERSATION
HE MAY HAVE HAD WITH ME AS
HE LEFT THE DINNER.
SO WE JUST SHOWED YOU A SMALL
PORTION OF THE HEARING AND
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T HAVE
THE TIME TO SIT AND WATCH THE
FULL HEARING, I CAN SUM IT UP
FOR YOU BY LETTING YOU KNOW THAT
JEFF SESSIONS RESPONDED TO EVERY
QUESTION PERTAINING TO RUSSIA
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS DID NOT WANT
TO ASK ABOUT RUSSIA, THEY ASKED
ABOUT A VARIETY OF OTHER RANDOM
THINGS WITH I DO NOT RECALL.
I DO NOT RECALL THAT HE DOES NOT
RECALL ANYTHING.
HE DOESN'T RECALL ANYTHING FROM
A YEAR TO HAVE A GO DRIVE
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER SIGNIFICANT
THINGS A YEAR AND A HALF
AGO, I MEAN, CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING?
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS TO ME AND THEN
HE WOULD PRETEND LIKE HE
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND QUESTIONS THAT
WERE INCREDIBLY CLEAR AND
HE DID NOT WANT TO ANSWER THEM.
MAYBE HE IS GOING TO GO WITH
ALZHEIMER'S DEFENSE TOO.
LOOK, COME ON, GUYS.
GET A LOAD OF THE OBVIOUS ON ITS
FACE ABSURD ARGUMENT THAT
SESSIONS IS MAKING.
HE SAYS, I DON'T RECALL HAVING A
CONVERSATION WITH PAPADOPOULOS.
I DID NOT RECALL IT, TELLING HIM
TO NOT PUT US IN TOUCH WITH THE
RUSSIANS, BUT NOW, I DO RECALL
IT AND I WAS AWESOME AND I TOLD
HIM DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE THAT
CONVERSATION WITH THE RUSSIANS.
YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER IT AT ALL
BEFORE.
NOW THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT YOU
WERE IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF
THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN TALKING TO
THE RUSSIANS, NOW THAT YOU DO
RECALL IT, YOU RECALL IT
WITH GREAT CLARITY AND INFOSYS
AND HOW YOU ALMOST YELLED
AT HIM TO KNOCK INVOLVED WITH
THE RUSSIANS.
HE IS A GOOD GUY.
NOW YOUR MEMORY IS
CRYSTAL-CLEAR, RIGHT?
COME ON.
YOU EITHER REMEMBER
OR YOU DON'T.
WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO IS GET
CREDIT, KNOCK IN TROUBLE
BECAUSE HE LIED ABOUT NOT
REMEMBERING THINGS BECAUSE
HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ALL THE RUSSIAN
CONNECTIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE A
LOT OF THEM, RIGHT?
ANYONE TO GET CREDIT FOR THAT
AND GET CREDIT FOR, I TOLD
HIM NOT TO GO AND I TOLD HIM NOT
TO PUT TRUMP AND PUTIN, HE
COULD GET CREDIT FOR THE SECOND
THING IF HE ADMITTED, I
LIED TO YOU GUYS STOP COURSE
ARMOR THAT CONVERSATION.
I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD HIM TO MAKE
SURE TRUMP AND PUTIN DIDN'T
MEET UP.
HE EXPLAINS WHY IT IS COMMON
FOR PEOPLE LIKE HIM TO NOT
RECALL CERTAIN THINGS.
LET'S LISTEN TO HIS REASONING IN
THE NEXT VIDEO.
MY ANSWERS HAVE NOT CHANGED.
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH,
AND I HAVE ANSWERED EVERY
QUESTION AS I UNDERSTOOD THEM TO
THE BEST
OF MY RECOLLECTION AS I WILL
CONTINUE TO DO TODAY.
ALL YOU HAVE BEEN IN CAMPAIGNS,
LET ME JUST SUGGEST THAT MOST OF
YOU HAVE NOT PARTICIPANT
PARTICIPATED IN A PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN AND NONE OF YOU HAD A
PART IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
IT WAS A BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN, I
THINK, IN MANY WAYS BUT IT WAS A
FORM OF CHAOS EVERY DAY FROM DAY
ONE.
WE TRAVELED, SOMETIMES IT TO
SEVERAL PLACES IN ONE DAY.
SLEEP WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY AND
I WAS STILL A FULL-TIME
SENATOR WITH A VERY FULL
SCHEDULE.
DURING THIS ERA, I'VE
SPENT CLOSE TO 20
HOURS TESTIFYING BEFORE
CONGRESS.
BEFORE TODAY I HAVE BEEN ASKED
TO REMEMBER DETAILS FROM A YEAR
AGO SUCH AS WHO I SAW ON WHAT
DAY AND WHAT MEETING AND WHO
SAID WHAT WHEN AND ALL OF MY
TESTIMONY I CAN ONLY DO MY
BEST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS
I UNDERSTAND THEM AND TO
THE BEST OF MY MEMORY.
BUT I WILL NOT EXCEPT AND REJECT
ACCUSATIONS THAT I HAVE EVER
LIED.
THAT IS A LIE.
AS I SAID BEFORE, MY STORY HAS
NEVER CHANGED.
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH AND
I'VE ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION TO
THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION AND
I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO TODAY.
WE KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE
BECAUSE HE RECUSED YOURSELF
BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD
NEVER MET WITH THE RUSSIANS WHEN
OUT FRANK AND ASKED YOU ABOUT IN
YOUR CONFIRMATION HEARINGS.
THEN WE FOUND THAT YOU MET WITH
THE RUSSIAN SEVERAL TIMES.
THEN YOU SAID WELL, WE DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT POLICY, THEN YOU
ADMITTED THAT YOU DID TALKED
ABOUT POLICY AND THEN YOU
RECUSE YOURSELF.
YOU CLEARLY LIGHT IN THE
BEGINNING ABOUT MEETING
WITH THE RUSSIANS.
NO, HE DIDN'T LIE.
IT'S JUST THAT INITIALLY HE HAD
NO RECOLLECTION.
NOW IT'S JUST, IT'S A
COINCIDENCE THAT I
CONVENIENTLY HAVE NO
RECOLLECTION WHEN IT
DOESN'T SUIT ME TO HAVE ANY
RECOLLECTION.
RIGHT?
THAT SOMETHING IS AMAZING.
AND THAT'S A STRATEGY AND IT HAS
WORKED SO FAR.
HE JUST SAYS HE DOESN'T
REMEMBER, THEN HE GETS
CALLED OUT HE IS LIKE ALL YEAH,
NOW I REMEMBER BUT HEY, I
WAS SO TIRED AND I WAS A
FULL-TIME SENATOR BECAUSE
SENATORS WORK REALLY HARD,
RIGHT?
WITH ALL THE STAFFERS THAT
THEY HAVE READING THE
LEGISLATION FOR THEM AND
BRIEFING THEM ON THINGS THAT.
THE SENATORS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT
DONE IN THE US LATELY.
TO BE FAIR TO THE REPUBLICANS,
WHEN CLINTON SAID THAT HE
WAS ALSO TIRED AND THAT IS WHY
HE LIED OVER UNDER OATH,
THE REPUBLICANS WERE LIKE YOU
ARE RIGHT, YOU ARE FREE TO GO.
SO SESSIONS, IF YOU BELIEVE LIKE
THE REPUBLICANS THAT WHAT
CLINTON DID WAS OUTRAGEOUS,
LYING UNDER OATH ABOUT AN
AFFAIR.
THIS IS LYING UNDER OATH ABOUT
THINGS THAT INVOLVE THE
GOVERNMENT AND WORKING WITH A
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO
PERHAPS INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS.
WAY MORE IMPORTANT AND SESSIONS
SHOULD BE GONE.
IF NOT, I AM EXPECTING APOLOGIES
FROM ALL REPUBLICANS WHO
PURSUED IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE NOW
THEY APPARENTLY THINK THAT
PERJURY IS NO BIG DEAL.
