we here at the Andrew Clavin show are hereby calling for an investigation on every single member of Congress we would also like an investigation on this administration and on the last administration and we would like further investigations into the investigators who are investigating the investigations into the other investigations we must investigate until the truth comes out the conspiracy is unraveled and we get to the bottom of the truth coming out of the conspiracy at the bottom of the truth that has come out during this conspiracy without these investigations it is our fear that government will devolve into a series of debates over ideas that lead to legislation and no one wants that trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show the SOI government ever do anything but investigate other members of our government I mean that's is now basically what they're doing for for a living it's mailbag day that's the important thing yes and I will try I'm gonna try and get to it sooner today I feel like I've been putting it off to the last week you know I love the mailbag because it's the only time I really get to communicate with you and and hear from what about what you're thinking about instead of what I'm thinking about which I'd much prefer I already know what I'm thinking about I'd like to hear from you but let me know you know I have no way of knowing what you guys like so let me know if you prefer the mailbag to be short or long or whatever I will try and get to it faster today and one of the reasons I'll be able to do that is because I won't be at the post office that's you know that's my usual problem is I have to stop what I'm doing and run to the post office and stand on line but but from now on instead I will be using stamps calm why because stamps calm brings all the terrific services of the US Postal Service right to your fingertips in your computer you can buy and print official US postage for any letter any package any class of mail using your own computer and printer it is easy and it is cool stamps.com will send you a digital scale that automatically calculates exact postage and stamps com will even help you decide the best class of mail based on your needs it really is like having the entire post office crammed into your computer which is just a lot of fun it's so much easier I find anyway than driving it stopping what you're doing and driving to the post office and waiting on line and the rest right now you too can enjoy the stamps comm service with a special offer that includes a four week trial plus postage and a digital scale here is what you do you go to stamps.com click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in Cleavon we ever gonna get rid of this guy que la VA en stamps.com and enter Clavin you get a four week trial plus postage and a digital scale with no long-term commitment and you never have to go to the post office again which is worth it listen I don't want to talk about Roy Moore and his magical dingus forever you know I mean certain point at which Roy Moore's crotch begins to lose you know lose interest for me but I have to say I got a lot of reaction to some of my reaction to what's going on and I want a run or respond to that I think it's important first a bunch of people said that yesterday I kind of convicted him too quickly basically and believing his accuser the girl who said when he was lady now who said when he was when she was 16 he attacked her choked her threatened her said no one will believe you if you tell anybody about this today Daryl Nelson the stepson of that woman Beverly young Nelson came out and said he doesn't believe her so let's let's hear what he has to say mr. Moore I support I don't believe thanks that she's claims you've done I don't believe it I'm known the woman she married my father many many years ago I've known him for a while now and I truly do not believe that she's being honest about this you're a good judge I'm thrown up knowing your name since I was a kid you cared about the 10 commandments you tried like hell to keep the Ten Commandments for being took out of the courthouse I remember so so that's that unfortunately everybody else has now basically dumped them Mitch McConnell says his campaign is collapsing the RNC the National Party seems to withdrawn funding and support Sean Hannity who you know is a partisan and a very strong partisan but he's always been good about investigations he does not get caught up in witch hunts he's always I I thought he should have won a Pulitzer Prize so seriously for his work during the la crosse rape case I think if he had been a liberal and that had been a liberal case of some sort I think Hannity would have a Pulitzer that he'll obviously never get one because he's Hannity but I think that even he this is what he said about more yesterday so Moore's losing even Shawn support here's where I am tonight between this interview that I did and the inconsistent answers between him saying I never knew this girl and then that yearbook comes out for me the judge has 24 hours you must immediately and fully come up with a satisfactory explanations for your inconsistencies that I just showed you must remove any doubt if you can't do this then judge Moore needs to get out of this race this country has way too many issues and problems the American people deserve a hundred percent truth and honesty we need correct answers the first time on issues that's serious yeah so I mean when you lose Shawn and when Shawn it's on you got 24 hours to clear your name you're in trouble so let me just respond to some of the people who wrote to me and tweeted me and did other things someone said that I was making I was being soft making excuses for sexual harassment and that is utter garbage what I all I was pointing out is that we are in a witch-hunt situation that does mean that we have to be careful and cautious of the accusations being made and I was also pointing out and in this kind of feminist witch-hunt that people put clumsy or even offensive flirting on the same lists as actual rape and actual you know assault that basically you're degrading these serious charges by mixing them and with things that just happen between men and women things happen between men and women men make mistakes women are flirtatious all kinds of things happen it's very complicated and before you start accusing people you want to know that you're accusing people and ruining their careers over something that is really really bad and my personal approach listen I live outside the realm of feminism I'm not a feminist I don't live as a feminist I don't re-sign I don't just come here and tell you I don't like it I don't live as a family I live as a gentleman I try to live as a gentleman but the problem is when feminists are telling you you don't have to be a lady men are not gonna be gentlemen and I think that that is a problem and I brought that out but I'm no way you know I think people who behave badly are bad you know this it's ridiculous not that I just completely dismiss but I thought I should bring it up somebody said to me that when the accuser came out and accused more of rape that she was crying and it was so long ago she wouldn't be crying anymore that is really bad thing like the whole the whole thing about this stuff is it sticks with you for life it hurts you for life I have given speeches and talks about my conversion experience and have gone through some of the things that happened to me when I was a little kid and more than 30 years ago it still chokes me up it still affects me we live in time this is one of the reasons that I can't support abortion with one of the reasons I'm pro-life is that I feel that you are the child you were you are the man a woman you will one day be I'm just as I feel a baby in the womb is the adult it will one day be and so I feel that we live in time and let person crying I just think she was very credible I was watching that thing and I just thought that was very credible look she might be lying it's possible but I will say this if this is a hit job it is one of the most elaborate conspiratorial jobs I have ever seen the evidence has really piled up somebody said there was this thing where he's more said that he had never heard of the restaurant where he met the woman who accused him of assaulting her and then she produced a yearbook that he had signed and he had signed it that he was a DA somebody said a couple of people pointed out that he was this is a kind of forgery theory the idea that the yearbook was forged that he was not a DA he was a deputy da but I've known a lot of DA's I've covered courts as a reporter you know they're a DA they're always a DA's because the DA is the elected usually the elected official at the top but they sometimes say I am a DA meaning I am one of the DA's people so I don't buy that somebody else a couple of people said that there was no Old Hickory house restaurant this is something that's a meme that's going around not true the listing for there's a listing for a restaurant called Old Hickory house barbecue and without the fake ie that they put at the end of old but that was established in 2001 which was after this event but a reporter for al.com which I guess is Alabama calm a guy named William Thornton dug up a city directory of Gadson from 1978 which lists a restaurant called Old Hickory house and with the proper address so and and you know there's just a lot of people who are talking about the fact that he hung out at the mall as a 30 year old guy picking up girls one mall said they had to ban him because he was bugging the little girls there or the young girls there there is a report from The Daily Beast this is just their report that even Steve Bannon has is starting to think about dumping him you know he has come forward a couple of times and talks about you know how he's gonna support him but they The Daily Beast says that over the past few days Bannon has begun privately taking the temperature of those in his inner circle to see what they think of the more allegations and to get their sense of how to proceed and according to four knowledgeable sources late last week the Breitbart chairman Bannon said I will put him in a grave myself always with his he's restrained his restrained talk I will put him in a grave myself if he determines that Moore was lying to him about the numerous accusations a source close to ven and relate and again tomorrow we're gonna have sebat have we got sebastian Gorka tomorrow is have we talked to him well okay so we're supposed to have some personal glory and this is something i really want to ask him about because let's just go back to that press conference that mitch mcconnell held with donald trump and he was asked about the back remember Trump and McConnell were supporting Luthor strange not Roy more on this in Bannen was fighting saying I'm starting a civil war within the Republican Party to get rid of what he calls the you know party it's war civil war blah blah blah and this is what Mitch McConnell said about that you know the goal here is to win elections in November the back in 2010 and 2012 we nominated several candidates Christine O'Donnell Sharron Angle Todd akin Richard Murdoch they're not in the Senate and the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election my goal is the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority the way you do that is not complicated you have to nominate people who can actually win because winners make policy and losers go home we changed the business model in 2014 we nominated people who could win everywhere we took the majority in the Senate we had one skirmish in 2016 we kept the majority in the Senate so our operating approach will be to support our incumbents and in open seats to seek to help nominate people who can actually win in November here's the thing I've said this before but it's worth repeating politicians are really good at being politicians if you ever go if you ever go to a baseball game in the minor leagues what is it is this triple-a that comes right before the major leagues I think it's triple yeah so you you ever go to a triple-a game these are guys one step down from the major leagues and what you're watching is human beings play ball when you go to the major leagues you're watching demigods play ball and that's because there aren't that many major leaguers they are the best of the best of the best right when you look at the people in the national government in the federal government you are looking at the best politicians there are they may not be nice people they may not be honest people they may not have your your same values and your goals but they're really good at being politicians or they wouldn't be with it where they are when you look at Mitch McConnell the leader of the Senate there's a reason he's in that position I'm not saying that you can only leave politicians to the professionals I'm just saying that before Bannon starts you know using that rhetoric about civil wars and the you know party and all this stuff before he starts using that rhetoric he ought to be sure that he's as good as they are at doing what they do because I think that it you know if he lose if you lose this Alabama seat there's six Democrats on now Alabama I mean you know there's like 16 Democrats and they could win a Senate seat at a time when we need every seat we have and it really is it really is a disastrous political situation and it's also a disastrous situation to ask conservatives to support a guy who may have done truly truly terrible things so I got back to this thing about investigations because everything is investigations now in Jeff Sessions was at the again was called before Congress and it's supposed to be about his Russian statements and he made a statement that he'd never talk to anybody during the Trump campaign about Russia and he said you know it was a great campaign it was a terrific campaign but it was chaotic every day was chaos I think all of us who have watched Donald Trump it's certainly but you Jeff Sessions on this and maybe you didn't remember everything he said and I you know I just sessions is a very straight shooting guy I just don't believe this thing but they you they bring these they bring him here and they're supposed to talk about Russia and they end up just the Democrats just hammering him about anything they can think oh I'll just play one one example of that let's play Guiterrez I really do not like Louie scooter Reza I don't know if that's how you pronounce his first name but he goes after sessions and this is what these things have kind of degraded into this cut ten five minutes mr. chairman before I begin I think I have a solution that could allow the committee to move on to other important national matters like gun control and immigration your class side clearly wants an investigation of Hillary Clinton and our side has been begging for months to hold hearings and start an investigation of the Trump administration and campaigns improper ties to mr. Putin and the Russian government my solution would say the American taxpayers a lot of grief and a lot of money by eliminating the need for the investigations I propose we simply go to the president and the former Secretary of State and ask them both to resign I'll go to Hillary Clinton you can go to Donald Trump and we'll tell you them both to resign then we can move on as a nation from an election that just never seems to end now I did Google organizations that Hillary Clinton leads and it came out zero so I'm not quite sure what you're gonna get her to resign from because he doesn't appear to be in charge of anything so this is what he called gas bagger II you know that's gonna get these hot-air balloons you know expel hot air all over the place and that's supposed to be important and then people put it up on YouTube say no Guiterrez destroys Jeff Sessions and that's nonsense I mean sessions should be at the Justice Department doing his job but the thing the other thing from the right from the right where I think they're making they're also making a kind of mistake is Jim George and who's the other one Tim Purdon and and louie gohmert who I love I think is great and also how who's Mike Gates I think his name is they're trying to get sessions to appoint a special counsel to investigate investigate Hillary Clinton so here is Jordan hammering him about the dossier the steel dossier which obviously is the that that fusion GPS thing that Hillary paid for to get dirt on Donald Trump from the Russians it's the closest thing we have to to basically collusion with the Russians during the campaign so let's let's just play well actually let's play cut number eight here's Jim Jordan pressuring pressuring sessions to try and get him to appoint a special prosecutor what's it going to take to get a special counsel we know that we know that former FBI director James Comey misled the American people in the summer 2016 when he called the Clinton investigation a matter it's obviously an investigation we know FBI director Comey was drafting in his honor a ssin letter before the investigation was complete we know Loretta Lynch one day before the Benghazi report came out five days before Secretary Clinton was scheduled to be interviewed by the FBI met with former President Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix we know after that meeting when she was corresponding with public relations people the Justice Department she was using the name Elizabeth Carlisle you know as I've said before it seems to me for just talking golf and grandkids you can probably use your real name we know that mr. Comey publicized the investigation and we know he made the final decision of whether prosecute or not and then when he gets fired he leaks a government document through a friend to the New York Times and what was his goal to create momentum for a special counsel and of course it can't just be any special counsel it's got to be Bob Lawler his best friend his predecessor his mentor the same Bob Muller who was involved we've now learned in this whole investigation with the informant regarding Russian businesses wanting to do business in the Iranian business here in the United States regarding the Iranian one deal so I guess my main question is what's it going to take if all that not to mention the dossier information what's it going to take actually get a special counsel it will take a factual basis that meets the standards of the appointment of a special is that so is that analysis going on right now well that's in the manual of the apartment of Justice about what's required we've only had two the first one was the Waco Janet Reno on senator Danforth who took over that investigation as special counsel and mr. Muller each of those a pretty special factual situation yes at this and we will use the proper standards and that's what I only thing I can tell you mr. Jordan what's the problem with this okay because a lot of Jordans points are absolutely true there's a lot of stuff that needs to be looked into and investigated and all this stuff you don't need a special counsel for this and in fact it's it's a bad idea the reason he wants this is because we now have this battle of Investigations going on which is what they do instead of arguing ideas instead of debating instead of legislating instead of doing the work that we sent them there to do this investigation has become the kind of go to action of our Congress and it is ridiculous so when they appointed this special Muller to look into the Russian collusion thing I went nuts if anybody was listening if you remember I just thought that was the stupidest thing they had ever done because once you appoint these guys they go they just run rampant they just go anywhere in order to get the kind of convictions that will make it look like it was worthwhile appointing them and there's reason to think that robert muller has got too many Democrat donors and all this stuff and there's also reason to think a lot of people trust him you know I'm not I'm not impugning his integrity I'm just saying once you do this these guys go wild Jordan wants our own wild it rampant you know investigator but the the only thing is you don't need a special investigator for this sessions has not recused himself sessions had recused himself from the Russian investigation that's why they needed a special counsel he hasn't recused himself from any of this so it doesn't mean he's not investigating it if he doesn't have some crazed special counsel running all over the place Jordan just wants to continue that battle that's you know and I think it's a waste of our money and our time and I think a lot of this is a waste if you you know the guys like I said sessions should be basically doing his job investigating Hillary Clinton but I I think that this is just it's a waste and it's a the wrong way to run a government it's like a tin pot you know it's like a tin pot dictatorship where you ingest just investigate everybody hey you know when I was working more in Hollywood I used to get to fly you

mailbag I'm more to say but I think that's that's the problem let's do the mailbag I said I would get to it a little earlier I get a lot of good questions that's why alright from Dominic master of the single nostril breath claim I understand this stands the stance that large-scale conspiracies undertaken by the government seem unlikely due to the next level incompetence of the people who run the show right that you know a conspiracy is just two people making a plan so there are conspiracies but they usually come out a cropper because people are incompetent that being said how on earth does what's-his-name Barack Obama and it is hard to remember his name now that his legacy is a smoking pile of ash in the Trump administration but how does how on earth does Barack Obama still have such a rich and fervent following despite the serious corruption of his administration that is so glaringly obvious to the rest of us it's his race that is why there is on the left especial but I think throughout the country there is a racial pathology that we have fallen into black people in this country were treated abominably not just by the slavery that Democrats held them in but when but the Jim Crow laws the Democrats passed that just brutalize people's lives I mean the Democrat when the Democrats became Ku Klux Klansmen that brutalized their lives and the steady prejudice you know once people are so abused once people are so abused you know it does create all these pathologies in their community and then people hate them for things that they're actually doing like committing crimes and so forth like this so once America lost its sense of itself as a virtuous country which it did have after especially after World War two lost its sense of itself as a virtuous country and reckoned with this they felt a lot of shame Americans felt a lot of shame and they changed and this country is no longer an institutionally racial racist country as no longer a country where you can pass laws hurting people because of the color of their skin and thank God for that that is a good good thing but this shame has made white people especially pathological in their guilt and in their attempt to display virtue and they display virtue even when it hurts black people the Barack Obama administration was lousy for blacks it was lousy economically it was lousy in terms of crime it was lousy in terms of in terms of turning communities against the police who need desperately need the police Obama played the race card every time he failed which was every time he tried to do anything and the left just could not let the first black president be a failure they could not let it happen it would mean that they themselves were part of the shame of the past and that is a pathology because none of us is we're not responsible for the past we're only responsible for today and tomorrow and changing things so that the stuff that happened to black people in this country doesn't happen again and they cannot let go of their virtue long enough to judge Obama rightly because it would just mean that their entire philosophy is wrong and that's why every time anybody criticized him it's like you're a racist as if you can't criticize the president I mean if if Trump if they had held Obama to the standard they held Trump which is that every word out of his mouth has taken in the wrong way Obama wouldn't have lasted a month all right from that that's my answer that's why it's racial pathology on the left from Katie why are you and been so hard on Knowles she seems pretty likeable and talented to me reminds me of a young Al Pacino Katie you're wrong he's a total knucklehead I'm hard on knowles because I'm a New Yorker and I'm hard on my friends Ben is hard on knowles because he's a sadist basically right heart renal and it is so much fun to torture from Danny deer highest incarnation of physical beauty and mental badassery Clavin I'm a Christian and a freelance DP that's a director of photography he's the guy who basically makes movies look great they always give the credit to the director but it's usually the DP I've been in the film industry for 10 years now and I'm clearly outnumbered as a Christian I'm only 31 and dude have I aged because of these people yes it's obvious they they have no interest in making anything of Christian value and the people who do make Christian media suck at it would you consider writing screenplays again to save us from God's not dead three Danny let me tell you something I will this is absolutely true Christians in this town get together and meet all the time and sometimes I am there and the problem we have is that God's not dead three costs you know 25 cents to make and makes a million dollars that the business model is just so strong it's hard to get around to making realistic things and when look I'm getting this we have this this thing that I keep touting another kingdom on iTunes that me and Noel's did I wrote it and Knowles performed it and it is a it's just a fantasy suspense story but it is written by a Christian and it is imbued with my values and people are complaining because it has the f-word in it because when I wrote it I left the f-word out and then I looked at and I thought this is not real life this is not a work of art because it doesn't represent real life and people are hammering me for it and attack me the thing is doing great it's got over 600 five-star reviews I'm really grateful for how well it's doing but I'm you know it does get to me every time I hear you're not a Chris you call yourself a Christian but you use the f-word you know I don't often usually but the fact is people do and you can't represent people realistically in a work of art so I will tell you I this is an absolute true story I was called to a meeting of several film Christians to sit together and talk I brought these points up I said I do not want to make candy you know God is the god of the real world he's not the God of Candyland I don't want to make movies about came John they called me up and in the nicest most Christian most polite way asked me not to come back they said you know you don't fit in here and it's not like I was screaming and yelling I just made the point that you're making here it's it's a problem because their business model works and Christians do not want to hear what I have to say anyone who wants to hear me say more about this there is a pamphlet on available on Amazon called the crisis in the arts it's by me I think it costs a buck I don't get any money for it it was put out by the David Horowitz people and and it supports them but it's a very short pamphlet and it talks about how the arts work and how what Christians misunderstand the most important thing the Christians and conservatives misunderstand is that Christian and conservative work does not look like Christian conservative world those are two different things the things that our founding fathers read to build this country were filled with bloodshed and sex they read the Greek tragedies they read Shakespeare they knew all the great classic work that deals with sex and violence and and a Bible by the way which also deals with these things it's very frustrating Danny I completely hear what you're saying and I you know I don't have an answer because there there's candy I don't know I don't have a better word to use with these these candy covered Christian films make a lot of money so I don't really have an answer for how to break through that business model Cassady love your pause cast eye lifts listen to it every day as a Catholic I want to charitably ask about your belief in theological truths and how you come to them on your own what leads an individual Christian to the fullness to truth in other words without the church I guess how do you know that you're always being guided by the Holy Spirit well you know this is the great divide between Protestants and Catholics both sides are looking for an absolute bedrock authority and that Catholics use the church and the Pope and the Protestants use Sola scriptura you know they use the scripture I reject both of those because I don't think there is anything on earth that is absolutely bedrock we are meant to use the holy spirit to find the truth and stumble toward the truth I do believe the Bible is inspired I do believe people I read you know I'm a very Catholic friendly I read a lot of Catholic theology but I don't look for it alone I look for it in the great works of Catholic theology and Christian and Protestant theology I look for truth in you know the great traditions and all these things the problem for me is that the Catholics are really good at not falling into the mistake of worshiping the Bible instead of worshipping God I think that is a problem among Protestants the Protestants are very good at not building a vast mountain of precedent like the Supreme Court that has nothing to do with the actual scriptures and I think that is a problem with Catholicism the things that some of the things the Catholic believe the Catholics believe have built up over the centuries that just are not connected to what Jesus had to say and what Jesus did so I think that both sides looking for absolute certainty both sides go astray in some way and what I do is I stumble forward through the dark with my Bible in one hand and great theologians and the other and prayer and try and find my way always with the kind of humility that I might be mistaken I might not be me it might not I might not be being guided by the Holy Spirit and that's why I'm slow today I try to be slow to judge and I try to go forward you know carefully and in prayer from Annette hi Andrew I have been a practicing Christian for as long as I've been breathing but in the last six months I have caved into fear and have not been attending church I watched services online but I cannot bring myself to take my family to church despite the fact that my husband is a concealed carry holder I recall as a child hearing about Christians butchered in their churches in the Middle East and hiding their services as a means of survival and thinking I hope that I can have that faith and courage for God if it ever comes down to it turns out I'm a total wimp I think what she's saying here she's worried about the church shootings is that yeah do you have any insight on how I can get past my fear and be present without having to run out of service halfway through because some guy brought a backpack and it gave me a panic attack yeah listen first of all obviously you're having a trauma reaction to the news of shooting because your odds of being shot in church are really really low I mean that that's so this is not a it's not rational but it is understandable okay so not in other words you're not reacting to reality very low chance that you'll be shot in church but you are reacting to events that are traumatic and difficult to to do and what I would suggest is that you've gathered together with other people in your church and the pastor and discuss this with him you know I mean I don't think you're being neurotic or crazy I think you're actually having a reaction to something but it's not it's not a reaction to the actual odds that you're facing so I think the things that a church can do that you can do together with your church and with the people in your church to make sure you feel safe to make sure people are behaving well and you know that that they're not threatening and they don't look threatening you know I this thought has come into my mind cuz sometimes I'll run down and take communion in the middle of the week and sometimes they'll be like you know homeless people who wander in and I think about this too but I think you have to join together you have to do this with other people you have to join together with other people in your church and have a communal reaction that helps you to deal with this I would be a good idea if you could overcome it because you're you know I think it's very low odds that anything bad is gonna happen to you let's see if it pleases his shininess Lourdes Clavin from Luke I request an audience with thee I was baptized and raised Roman Catholic and like every other curious know-it-all kid who goes through biology class I rapidly turned away from Jesus thinking that I and all my 15 years of infinite wisdom knew better I became an atheist believing that science and religion IRRI inconsolable but after coming out of a seven-year haze of materialism I begun to delve into my spirituality and have begun back down the path towards God my question is about prayer I find it hard to pray when I don't know who I'm praying to is prayer something that will guide me down the path and become more powerful to me as my faith strengthens or is it futile until I sort myself and my faith out no I don't think it's a futile at all it's like saying I don't know who you are Clavin and I can't talk to you until I find out it's only by talking to me that you can find out you know that's the thing and now obviously what I said before about not just prayer but also scripture also the great traditions also your church and all those things that help guide you God will teach you who he is when I started praying I write about this and the great good thing I was like it was complete no-man's land for me I didn't have a church I didn't I didn't it wasn't a Jew anymore believing Jew anymore so I was just praying in an absolute vacuum and I was thinking like well you know can you I pray for a Cadillac can I pray that like I can have an affair without getting caught can I pray you know what can you what can you pray for can you pray for anything but how does it work and slowly and not actually all that slowly God taught me who he was and he's still teaching me but he taught me you know what what it is what kind of prayers are important and which ones will bring me closer to him and coming closer to him just makes your life so much more joyful that it's just worth doing every day I really do believe that people should be alone for at least 10 minutes every day at 15 if you can do it and pray out loud so it you know people don't hear you but if you pray out loud you finish your sentences and and you finish your thoughts and it's really helpful so that's you know I think you have to pray to find out who God is just like you have to talk to people to find out who they are alright um I'm running out of time and there's one here that I must get into dear Lord clay Venus Maximus the wise I was in a relationship for two years with a woman I absolutely adored and truly believed that I was going to spend the rest of my life with we were deeply in love and making arrangements to move in together when she decided out of nowhere at least from my perspective that she didn't think we had a future together it's been six months and I'm still not over her what advice can you give me for trying to move on and finding a woman to start a life with that's from Jacob so this is grief you're experienced in grief and I've said this a couple of times but it is worth saying grief is a desert that has to be crossed on foot and the reason I say that is because grief is not something you know people want you to get over grief that very impatient with it it usually takes about a year that is the average time it takes to get get through grieving but the thing is grief is when I say it's a desert that has to be crossed on foot what I mean is that you actually are on a journey through something you're not just in Poole unless you just languish in it you're actually journeying through something and it's important when you journey across a wasteland which is what grief is like it's important where you come out on the other side you're gonna come out in you know a slum or you're gonna come out in the spiritual Vegas you know everything is good you know and that's why I think it's if you can if you believe and you can pray I think that's a very important that you're following God through that desert so you get on the other side when you come out on the other side that you are actually richer and deeper for the journey that's what you're trying to do you're trying to use the grief to make you a better person listen I've grieved over numerous things including a broken heart and one of the things that happens is it becomes part of who you are you know as I said before we live in time we continue to be the person that we were before and that melancholy that you've been through that sadness becomes a kind of sweeter melancholy that helps you to appreciate the the beautiful things that are happening in your life at this moment because all things good and bad pass away when you come to the other side and you will I you know if you keep journeying the reason people get stuck in grief is when they become proud of their grief they become fascinated by it and addicted by it and so that you don't want to do that you want to keep moving keep walking forward and when you do just open your you know you your heart will open up again you open your heart up to love and you don't have to go and find the girl you marry to you know the sloppysecondz to replace this girl you want to start to meet women and hopefully find one that you can love again and I know you will I know you will you just have to make that journey and be patient with it because not only not only do we ourselves get impatient with our grief of people around us get impatient with our grief even if they love us they just get so tired of hearing us bring up the same subjects again and you know why when are you gonna stop and what you have to realize is this is part of the process it's a it's a journey you just cannot hurry you just have to make the journey and you will get to the other side but it's important and if you can pray and believe that will help you to get to a good place when you get to the other side because grief is part of life can I do one more thing and do one more I mean from Kevin dear Andrew my wife and I have an adult daughter with significant special needs caused by brain trauma when she born ten weeks early I recently saw a tweet stating that having an abortion can increase a woman's odds of preterm birth in later pregnancies before my wife became a Christian and before we met she had two abortions the news that her abortions may keep may have contributed to our daughter's problems is painful to me my inclination is to keep this news to myself to protect my wife however I'm a little worried that carrying this information alone could create a wedge in our happy marriage okay first of all there there is some science behind this that abortion can lead to preterm births there's some science behind that but like all these things that could change and you don't know and you don't know in your particular case and you certainly should follow your inclinations and keep this to yourself and if you need to talk to somebody a therapist or something talk to it what I think you are really dealing with and I'm gonna be blunt about this you know the heart is filled with all kinds of irrational feelings and it's not you're not to blame for that that's true of everybody's heart that's true of everyone but I think you are harboring beneath the surface of your consciousness I think you're harboring the idea that somehow this is a punishment on your wife and you're angry I think some somewhere in a subterranean level you're angry at your wife for having done something that was brought back as a punishment on your on your daughter that's not true that's not how God works God is not punishing your wife he's not punishing your daughter this is a tragic thing tragic things happen in life and yes we make bad choices and that sometimes leads to tragedy but this is not your wife's fault and it is not your daughter's fault and it's not a punishment from God your daughter is a blessing from God you just have to find that blessing and I know it's difficult and I know she's suffering in all this but I think you have to find where that blessing is you that's why that's why we don't abort our children because we know they're going to be a blessing so when you want to tell her about this what I think you really want to do is I think you really want to bring out your anger and I know you don't you may not feel that anger but I think it's there and I think you want to accuse her and tell her that God is punishing her keep it to yourself and if you have to deal with it in some other way go to a therapist go to a friend and talk it through because this is not a punishment you know this you are blessed with a wife who has found her way she in becoming a Christian she has been forgiven now you have to forgive her too God has forgiven her now you have to forgive her - and and move on and try to find the blessing in a difficult situation all right I guess I have to get to the the end - tickety-boo news so I have to bring this up global atheist convention called reason to hope is cancelled because no one wants to go I don't mean to be triumphalist is about it but here's the story I think this is from us this is the daily walk the third annual global peace convention ironically dubbed recent - hope has been canceled due to dismal ticket dismal ticket sales the Sydney Morning Herald reports turns out offering Neela's impaction teselle - well to the masses the conference which was scheduled for February of this year was set to be headlined by atheist novelist Sir Salman Rushdie who was a huge get for the convention organizers you would think so this is the guy the Ayatollah Khomeini this is when Islamism first really rose to the surface the Ayatollah told a hoe meny issued a fatwa against Rushdie for his novel The Satanic Verses in 1989 and fellow atheist Richard Dawkins was also in the anti God roster there was a star you know this is something that people are noticing that the remember the new atheist Dawkins and all these other people they were supposed to be such a big deal and this they've kind of fizzled it's kind of fizzled out and I will tell you why I think this has happened I believe that the new eight that popularity of the New Atheists was an attempt to salvage multiculturalism in the face of Islamism of radical Islam nobody wanted to say nobody on the Left wanted to say maybe Islam is a bad religion maybe you know maybe there is a God and God has certain features and qualities and you can be wrong about God who God is I think a person who is serving a mean nasty judgmental little Allah who wants him to blow people up because he doesn't believe in him is not serving God at all I don't believe that Allah is Allah I don't believe that Allah is God and I think that people were afraid to say that they were afraid to say hey you know there's a problem in the house of Islam there's a problem with the gob they're worshipping so instead they said well it's all religion all religion a big problem now Sam Harris has been very good about this he does he is an atheist and he does say Islam is really the big problem and he gets hammered for that a lot so Sam Harris is off the hook on this play if the popularity of these people was based on this idea that somehow this was gonna save us from getting rid of our multiculturalism III was writing books for Thomas Nelson some of my young adult thrillers for Thomas Nelson and I said to him you don't have to be afraid of atheists because when you argue with them you win their arguments are lousy and look some of these people Dawkins is a smart guy his arguments are lousy you know I mean Sam Harris smart guy his arguments are bad you can beat these guys in argument I love to have atheists come out and say what they have to say because I think we can win that argument the things that really hurt God are corruption in the church I mean Catholics get angry at me because I'm always because I keep going back to the priest molesters not because I don't like the Catholic Church because I like the Catholic Church and these that's what hurts God what hurts God is small mindedness and meanness and you know hammering people with your Bible for their lives instead of forgiving them which is God keeps telling you to do on every page of the New Testament you know being judgmental and small-minded in the name of God which is not God you know those are the things that hurt God but atheism you know intellectual atheism is great we can always challenge that and I'm not so sure Richard Dawkins is gonna make it to the grave without making his mine because I've heard him say things like you know I'm a what does he say I'm a secular Christian and all that because that doesn't make any sense and Dawkins is gonna smart enough you might figure that out so anyway I just wanted to say that I think when you read news about the new atheist that's what you're reading you're not reading an attack on God you are reading an attack on God but you're also reading a desperate attempt to defend a philosophy relativism which has failed utterly and fails per se because it makes no sense tomorrow hopefully Sebastian gorkel will be here and we will we will put him we will put his feet to the fire in question about this civil war in the GOP and what Roy Moore means for it please be there and next week are we gonna do run got atoms and I interviewed Dilbert creator Scott Adams what a great interview that was and that's gonna be next week I think on Tuesday probably since Thursday's Thanksgiving all right I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we'll see you again tomorrow
