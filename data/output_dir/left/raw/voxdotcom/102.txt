1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,220
As many as half of Earth's species may be

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,480
already migrating to escape warming temperatures.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,260
Plants are inching northward

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,080
and so are many animals.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,960
The Arctic ecosystem is particularly vulnerable to invasion.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,580
Scientists aboard this research ship are hunting

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,820
the most important fish in the Arctic: polar cod.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,620
Mixed in with the Arctic fish are invaders

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,140
including Atlantic cod and capelin.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,100
The southern species compete for polar cod's food.

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,120
So here is a very typical Arctic food web

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,880
or food chain.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,600
This food web is changing now.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,900
These fish are among many species

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,000
migrating into the warming Arctic.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,260
Relatively few species have evolved

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,240
to survive its frigid darkness.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,880
Polar cod have some of the most impressive

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,820
adaptations to survive.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,320
They use a trick that's common among arctic animals,

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,000
they store lots of fat in their bodies.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,090
Polar cod eat tiny copepods,

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,160
which also store fat to survive the long winter.

24
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,420
And a high energy meal is crucial

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,660
for surviving the harsh Arctic.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,000
One trawl after another reveals  southern interlopers.

27
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,940
Out of a thousand fish caught in this trawl,

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,960
roughly 70% by weight are southern species.

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,960
It's hard for the scientists to pinpoint precisely

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,280
when we cross the boundary

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,620
between Atlantic and Arctic waters,

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,300
but that boundary has been slowly creeping northward.

33
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,980
Scientists call this process

34
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,140
the 'Atlantification' of the Arctic.

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,800
Atlantic waters are saltier and they mostly lack ice.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,160
The biggest difference?

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,280
Atlantic water is as much as seven degrees warmer.

38
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,080
The polar Cod likes the colder water,

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,620
but it's losing territory.

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,900
Polar Cod flourish in the shallow waters

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,080
of the Barents Sea, but further north 
it's too deep for them.

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,260
Meanwhile, the warmer waters bring with them

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,800
new species that are shaking up the food web.

44
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,800
Along with new fish, there are Atlantic varieties of copepods.

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,620
They store much less fat than copepods native

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,020
to the Arctic, making them a less nutritious food source.

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,460
That means polar cod may have to spend more energy hunting.

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,260
For the same amount of animals that are gonna be eaten,

49
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,080
you don't transfer the same amount of energy.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,720
Capelin, as well as Atlantic Cod,

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,500
were among the invaders we just caught in the trawl.

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,520
Capelin will also feed on the same prey

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,560
as the polar cod, so we start adding competition

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,280
between these two species.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
The Atlantic Cod goes one step further:

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,700
it eats the polar cod itself.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,620
Capelin's not as rich as polar cods, so that goes

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,580
or diminishes, then these levels will also be impacted.

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,400
It's easy to vilify the southern species

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,800
threatening the ecological balance here.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,980
But take the Atlantic cod,

62
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,200
in their natural habitat, overfishing and now

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,260
rising temperatures have decimated its population.

64
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,500
So here in the Arctic, Atlantic Cod seems like an invader,

65
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,680
but it's also a climate refugee from the south

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,600
and its main predator is another

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,060
key species advancing northward.

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,800
Historically, most humans who have come to the Arctic

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,960
have taken a lot more than data and a few samples.

70
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,380
For at least 45,000 years, people have been coming

71
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,340
to this paradoxical region.

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,260
Punishing, desolate but rich with resources.

73
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,320
Humans are the Arctic's ultimate apex predator

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,280
and yet we're only getting started.

75
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,920
With countries like Norway extracting
fossil fuels offshore,

76
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,620
other sectors are also expanding northward.

77
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,360
From tourism, to shipping, to military operations.

78
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,580
So the stressers in the Arctic

79
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,680
are probably going to intensify.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,020
As the climate here changes

81
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,160
so will the meaning of the word Arctic.

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:00:00,000
For the animals who, for now, call it home.
