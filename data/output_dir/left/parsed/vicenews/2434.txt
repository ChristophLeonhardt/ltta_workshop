which is a national problem it's funny
because people don't know that much
about it but it's it's huge
the problem with burning coal as an
electricity source is if you continue to
burn cold you're always going to
continue to produce a toxic by-product
which is coal ash there's ponds across
the state of North Carolina at 14 power
plants and all of them fully the
groundwater and everyone that's been
investigated is illegally discharging
toxic metals into area waterways the
water keepers came and tested our whale
and we got the news that we have
hexavalent chromium in our whale I just
remember shock feelings chop all I could
think about is what have I done
what would have what have I allowed my
children to drink and and just sheer
fear when I lie for me
