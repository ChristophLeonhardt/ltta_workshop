152
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,110
difference to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation and I'm</font>

153
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,150
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really not open to people putting</font>

154
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,820
their standards on me base

155
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,490
my age you know stop thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

156
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,960
about my legacy you know when I have

157
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,820
kids and I settle down you know what am

158
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,160
I gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell them that I was doing at 29</font>

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,030
and so I made a point this here to be a

160
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more selfish to allow myself</font>

161
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,260
to be firm with who I am and where I

162
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,470
stand and allowed myself to be overly

163
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,450
confident with myself and do what it is

164
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,360
that I want to do you know it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

165
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,710
of hazy because I did another reading

166
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,650
with um the<font color="#E5E5E5"> astrologers Sam Reynolds who</font>

167
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,750
I had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> video on with this year he gave</font>

168
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,850
me like a short meeting in that video

169
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had another follow-up</font>

170
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,540
meeting and he says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know at 29</font>

171
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">years of your return of saturn so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in</font>

172
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,440
my return of saturn and he's like this

173
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stake my claim and you</font>

174
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
know on what I own in life and really

175
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,900
kind of move forward with ensuring that

176
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,730
my heart is always better than the

177
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,860
feather so living the life<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want</font>

178
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,120
versus living the life that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

179
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,700
expect me to live and you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

180
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,050
makes sense because that's how I already

181
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,730
lived at and it's never it's not easy

182
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,770
you know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to I also do</font>

183
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,270
everything with a sense of integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

184
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,430
good intention and you know that's

185
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely been tested since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I moved to</font>

186
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">houston and I've been more aware of kind</font>

187
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,850
of even though I might not get the

188
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,130
results that I want right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

189
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,620
long-term benefits<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just really</font>

190
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,140
staying true to<font color="#CCCCCC"> who I am as a person</font>

191
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,820
with integrity and good intentions and

192
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,610
you know being okay with the fact that i

193
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,620
live and talk and do things a lot

194
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,170
differently from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainstream myth the</font>

195
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,580
focus this year I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no spy reason why</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">spend the last bit of my 20s miserable</font>

198
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,340
because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i'm supposed to keep a</font>

199
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,080
job and just stick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and try things</font>

200
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,610
and do all the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people</font>

201
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,830
are saying it's gonna make me happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I</font>

202
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,470

205
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,340
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so I'm still on that path</font>

206
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,010
way it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a work in progress and</font>
