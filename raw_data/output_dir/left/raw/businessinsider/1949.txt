unconstructed blazer this one happens to

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,950
be from<font color="#CCCCCC"> canale the idea of this jacket</font>

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,420
is the fact that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,460
it works just as well the t-shirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,110
jeans as it does with a pair of slacks

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,390
and a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> time right here we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,740
oversized scarf we're seeing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">blanket strike to it it's a great thing</font>

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,930
to just you know again keep you warm

40
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,549
transitional dressing so gets a little

41
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,990
hot gets a little cold you're not going

42
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,000
to be overheating you can take this off

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,430
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobility is very important</font>

44
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,409
and I think that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of being able</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your clothes and not have</font>

46
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,770
to change for one environment to another

47
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,860
is really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the modern man</font>

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,439
because so much is so much as asked of

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:00:00,000
