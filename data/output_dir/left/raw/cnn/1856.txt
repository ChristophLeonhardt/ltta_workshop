00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
jay-j thanks so much for being with us
first so when you when you see a

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,140
neighborhood like this what goes through
your mind devastating I mean I think

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,660
that's the only word that can describe
when you drive through the city when you

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,009
see the floods when you see the pictures
on TV of what's happening devastating is

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,160
the only word that you can use but I
think inspiring is the next word that

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,920
comes to mind because of what you're
seeing neighbors do exactly you see the

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,010
neighbors you see the policemen you see
the firemen you see the helicopters you

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,640
see what humanity can do when everybody
comes together at a time like this and

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,080
that's the most inspiring part of it all
so did this idea of fundraising when did

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,079
you come up with it well we were stuck
in Dallas so we played a game in New

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,829
Orleans a week ago and then they said we
couldn't come home from New Orleans so

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,680
they flew us to Dallas and we were
sitting in Dallas in a hotel and I'm

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,850
watching all this unfold on TV and so I
said I feel helpless I feel like I want

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,670
to do something to help our people what
can I do from Dallas I can't physically

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,960
help so I want to raise money and I set
out to raise $200,000 and just took a

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,930
video on my phone that was the initial
goal that was only to go with $200,000

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,160
did you think you could get 200 yeah I
thought I could get 200,000 I had a plan

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,750
for 200,000 what I was going to do and
now we're over 12 million going into the

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,510
13 million dollar range so new plan a

20
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,250
lot of a lot of folks have been waiting
to see you are very grateful obviously

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,540
when you win when you saw it starting to
go up and when you reach 200,000 and

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,110
then I mean every time you clicked on
the site did you just see the number

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,720
this kept scrolling and scrolling and
then we broke the site and then it cuts

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,460
you brother and we broke the site the
funniest story of it all is actually the

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,490
initial night we broke the site we
couldn't figure out how to get back up

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,570
and we somehow found the CEOs phone
number and called him at his house at

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,140
his house and got him out of bed he
helped us fix the site and then it got

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,170
rolling so here we are
wow that's customer service that's cuz I

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,250
mean I got to give the guy credit it was
unbelievable and he probably helped us

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,460
raise a ton more money because he kept
the site up and rolling so do you have a

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,759
goal now in mind or is it just
open-ended it's a kind of open-ended you

32
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,210
know once we hit 10 million I said I'm
gonna put it at 15 see what happens and

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,329
I mean we're yesterday we raised four
million today it's already over three

34
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,079
million so we're just gonna let it go
and see where it goes I mean maybe it's

35
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,038
the 20 maybe it gets more but now I'm
really focusing my efforts on making

36
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,190
sure that I get that money directly back
you know do you know how you're gonna go

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,590
about doing that
so my first phase is what I'm doing is

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,379
this weekend my teammates and I we'd
have semi trucks rolling in from out of

39
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,560
town that we've filled up we have about
nine semi trucks are going to come into

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,599
town and we have those all filled with
stock supplies water food clothing

41
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,940
everything so we're going to give that
out this weekend that's our first step

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,060
and then I want to regroup after this
weekend because obviously like I said I

43
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,709
was planning for 200,000 and now with a
new plan for multi multi-millions I'm

44
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,190
gonna make sure that get with the people
that dig Katrina and that learn from

45
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,640
Katrina so that I can make sure I do it
right because with these people trust me

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,489
with their money I want to make sure
that I don't do it hastily I want to do

47
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,819
it exactly the right way so I can help
the most people find you've already been

48
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,549
talking to people who went through
Katrina friends Muir's other football

49
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,510
players just to get a sense of what they
did yeah what works what doesn't

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,810
yeah I've spoken to drew brees I talked
to him for quite a while today gonna get

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,870
on the phone with some more people I've
talked to some some of the companies

52
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,079
that helped out over there just to kind
of get a glimpse of what went wrong what

53
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,750
went right and how do you think we can
do it best this time and I've gotten

54
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,720
some really good information and the
best thing that people have told me so

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,810
far is take your time to make sure you
do it right and I want people to know

56
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,940
that that's what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take my time to make sure I do

57
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,450
it right because I want to do right by
these people that need it and I also

58
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,150
wanted to right by the people that trust
me with their money if you see I mean in

59
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,420
a situation like this there are
emergency needs like right now right

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,489
here right now but this is something
that goes on for weeks months years and

61
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,340
instants yes and so I spoke to the mayor
today of Houston I spoke to the mayor of

62
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,310
Houston today to talk about those
immediate needs and we talked about what

63
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,400
I'm gonna do on Sunday and exactly where
I can get those resources to make sure

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,670
that we get to take care of those
emergency situations but like you said

65
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,639
this isn't a one-day this isn't a
one-week this isn't one month thing this

66
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,989
is gonna take months and years and years
so I want to make sure that since we do

67
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,169
have this large sum of money I want to
make sure that I do it right over the

68
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,139
long period and I want Houston to know
that I'm with them in the long haul I'm

69
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,840
not just here for the initial fundraiser
I'm here to make sure that we take care

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,690
you down the road have you ever seen
anything like this before never I mean

71
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,540
from Wisconsin original never and I was
just talking about that with some of my

72
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,079
teammates you know you see things on TV
you see you saw Katrina on TV you see

73
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,650
these disasters on TV but you've never
really been a part of it and until

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,410
you're a part of it you can never
understand what it's like and so to be

75
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,668
in it to see my city going through it to
see all of our people going through it

76
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:22,409
and streets that you know flooded 50
feet high that's when it hits the most

77
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,610
home and I think that's that's really
why I'm so passionate about making sure

78
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,770
do this right I'm wondering how your
teammates and their families are

79
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,819
reacting to it's been different because
some guys some guys can't get to their

80
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,729
home so we have some guys who are in
evacuation zones we have some guys who

81
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,870
had two feet of water in their house we
had a couple of our staff members had to

82
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,539
be evacuated by boat boat so it's just
really been here and there but the one

83
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:48,509
thing that our team is all about is
helping and giving back so once their

84
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,750
families were safe once everybody's safe
I know we had a group of guys go over to

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,090
one of the shelter's tonight and play
with the kids at the shelter and bring

86
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,479
some toys it's really about whatever we
can do and then once the football season

87
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,319
starts it's about three hours every
Sunday if we can be a distraction for

88
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,439
the fans and be a distraction for the
people to take their mind off it it's so

89
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,009
interesting on something like this it
kind of takes off that way and a life of

90
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,889
its own you know the fundraising you're
doing you have some you know big-name

91
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,430
people given a lot of money but you also
just have a lot of people who have been

92
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,000
moved by what you've done and want to
help so I think like you so many people

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,870
have seen this on television I feel
frustrated that right where do I donate

94
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,349
what can I do and I think that's what's
so interesting and awesome about the

95
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,889
time that we live in right now is this
crowdfunding idea has really taken off

96
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,279
and so while we do have people donating
a million dollars five hundred thousand

97
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,069
we also have people donating five
dollars and that's all they can donate

98
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,949
but they are donating because they want
to be a part of it and they want to show

99
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:41,759
their support there's over the last time
I checked there was over a hundred and

100
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,000
ten thousand people that had donated
them I mean it's incredible and they're

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,150
from all over the country all over the
world we've had people from different

102
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,659
countries donate so I just I can't thank
everybody enough I think that's my

103
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,330
biggest message is the city of Houston
thanks you for what you've done

104
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,300
and I appreciate you trusting me I'm
gonna make sure that I do everything I

105
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,719
can to get the city of Houston back on
this yeah you know I was out today with

106
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,930
a Coast Guard chopper crew just going
around and they were doing incredible

107
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,710
rescues and you just see the dedication
of folks who you know them they're

108
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,800
working around the clock a lot of them
have come from all over the country to

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,669
be here and and the volunteers you know
the CryEngine Navy folks who grabbed

110
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,180
Road and are doing what they can I think
the difficult times bring out the best

111
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,699
in humanity that's kind of something
that I've said this week a couple of

112
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,699
times and it's so true I think with
everything that's going on in the world

113
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,520
and no matter what happens no matter if
you're rich poor no matter if you're

114
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,490
black white the one thing that we can
all rally around is helping our fellow

115
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,669
human and I think that we've seen that
in abundance this weekend I think we're

116
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,149
gonna continue to see that in abundance
in Houston's a very diverse City it's a

117
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,300
very resilient city and so to see these
people all come together that's what's

118
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,759
so inspiring
I think we can all take a page out of

119
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,609
that book and try and help our fellow
did you ever think you would see a

120
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:48,389
response like this I mean in an event I
mean you always wonder well what would

121
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,909
happen if I lived through something like
this do you ever think you would see

122
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,599
people come together I always hope so
but to see you coming to reality is a

123
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,569
whole different ballgame and it's so
sweet to watch it's so beautiful to

124
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,909
watch you see lines of volunteers where
you're like is that a line for the food

125
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:05,459
or is that a line and then all of a
sudden it's a line of volunteers and I

126
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,909
think it's so special when you have that
many people wanting to help in that many

127
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,299
people willing to give what they can
shelters are turning away supplies

128
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,989
because they have so many so yeah it's
really encouraged so important about

129
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:19,409
what you're doing is that you know
people see okay well stop raining people

130
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:22,349
who aren't here seems stopped raining
and they think oh the worst is over

131
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,979
things are getting better but you go to
Beaumont today where they just ran out

132
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,289
of clean drinking water and have to
evacuate a hospital you go to some of

133
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,829
these other areas even in neighborhoods
on your reservoirs where there's still

134
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:35,039
water coming in right and that's the
thing is we cannot forget about what's

135
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,589
going on just because the water is
starting to recede in the storms

136
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,799
starting to go away we need to help out
those other areas we need to continue to

137
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,189
raise the money because they're saying
that at some of these areas with the

138
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,369
water aren't going to go away for quite
a long time and obviously that's when

139
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,129
the real work starts because we need to
get these houses clean when you get them

140
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,159
rebuilt when you get these people back
in their homes because so many people

141
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,719
have been displaced how how - how do
people go back down any money the front

142
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:01,709
the site is you caring calm slash JJ
Watt you can go to the site tearing calm

143
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:06,029
you caring calm slash JJ Watt okay you
can go to the site you can watch it

144
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,589

145
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,409
checks can go directly to my if you want
to mail a physical check or whatever you

146
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:18,359
liked is the Justin J watt foundation
and so it's so you did you create a

147
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,269
foundation so I've had that we had on
dating for seven years but it's been

148
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,389
donated after school athletics for
middle school kids so we had to create a

149
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,389
branch we went through all the legal
paperwork and everything to make sure

150
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,389
that we create a branch so we could
accept these donations and now we're

151
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,240
gonna obviously take that money and give
it directly to the people from Hurricane

152
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,870
Harvey but yeah we've gone through a lot
of there's been a lot of phone calls a

153
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,479
lot of legal conversations everything
just to make sure we do it the right way

154
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,779
because like I said the number one thing
is I want these people and know that the

155
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,259
money that they're donating it's going
directly to Houston so finally I mean

156
