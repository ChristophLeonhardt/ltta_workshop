I just addressed the participants of the Youth Forum here and now we'll have our regular briefing here will cover some political matters and I would like to start this briefing considering that we are in Kaliningrad I would like to start by saying something about Kaliningrad internationally in inter regional ties the unique geographical location of Kaliningrad region means that plays an active role in Russia's international ties with European partners Kaliningrad region is one of the leading provinces in the Russian Federation in terms of the number of international contacts this helps with direct dialogue with the nations of Europe the policy of openness and good neighborly relations as an example of such successful cooperation there was a year of Germany in Russia in the year of Russia in Germany for original and municipal partnerships recently also for matches of the World Cup took place in Kaliningrad in June this year and over 100,000 foreigners visited the in Kaliningrad region drawing from this experience the region will now host other international major sporting events for example on October 11th Russia will play Sweden as part of the UEFA nations League here in Kaliningrad the coining red region makes an important contribution to our interaction with the European Union as part of the International cross-border cooperation between Russia and the EU Russia Poland 2014-2020 and Russia Lithuania 2014 2020 despite anti-russian sanctions the amount of international trade in Kaliningrad region is growing commerce with Poland and Lithuania is increasing to

facilitating environment regulations and the visa regime EVs will now be used for people living in the Kaliningrad region similarly to the one used in Vladivostok also one of the cities in declining

signed in act hour at the fifth gas P&C summit sets up a mechanism for five-party consultations between foreign affairs ministries of the five Caspian Sea States we had a lot of questions about this

around the world will discover the books by chingiz aitmatov for themselves I find something important find some more wise answers to eternal questions in his books next we go on to Syria the situation in Syria is steadily improving because of successful actions by government forces in southern Syria with he support by the russian air force hotbeds of terrorism in the promises of Dera and the nature have been completely eliminated also the operation Becki eating so-called irreconcilable opposition groups and their families have been completed in Dara the last group of 452 people left last Sunday in the last two weeks the Syrian government forces were able to liberate 2,000 square kilometers of Syrian territory refugees keep coming back last Monday 204 refugees came back to Syria from Lebanon including 61 women and 104 children as far as internally displaced persons are concerned over 316 Syrian citizens have returned to their homes including 189 in the province of Homs 85 in east gouta and 42 in Deir Ezzor in 117 terms of Syria refugee centers have been set up for four hundred ninety thousand refugees also in 295 towns work is underway to set up infrastructure for accommodating refugees and internally displaced persons for one almost 1 million people in just the last 24 hours I'm referring to August 14th 16 houses have been repaired in Syria one kilometre of roads have been has been repaired and 1.5 kilometers of electricity lines power lines has been restored in the town of huge ela outside Damascus there was a humanitarian event 3.7 tonnes of food was distributed and the Khedira foundation distributed one ton of bread in the area of Sheikh Saeed Russian military doctors have provided medical assistance to six people including three children in the town of Salvia in the province of Deir Ezzor and also provided medical services to 54 people including 16 children in the settlement of yelled outside damascus demining continues in the province of Homs to hackers of territory has been demand including 10 buildings 50 explosive devices have been defused including 21 improvised explosive devices now a few words on the so-called white helmets and the evacuation operation we know that it reports in the media claiming that the United Nations refugee agency and Human Rights Council were somehow involved in the process of evacuating the white helmets unfortunately the the office itself confirmed these reports on its official website so essentially the UN supports the misinformation campaign in Western media regarding the white helmets painting them as fearless humanitarian workers we would like to point out and ask why why are these heroes not staying in Syria even though the situation is now peaceful there why they are not distributing bread why they are not rebuilding medical posts infrastructure why do they leave why they're not thinking about children who need to go to schools why they're not thinking about civilians why are those humanitarian workers fleeing no it's just because the only purpose for their existence was the circulating fake news fake stories about chemical weapons and promoting this propaganda online spreading his information on the internet claiming that government forces allegedly used some chemical weapons this is the only thing that the so-called white helmets did we would like to point out that the United Nations refugee agency should be closer attention to its reputation and what it does in Syria we remind everybody that the white helmets are spreading misinformation they use humanitarian aid is and excuses that cover-up in fact these people represent extremely dangerous terrorist groups and their only purpose is to belie the efforts by the Syrian government forces and Russia in fighting terrorism they're cynically spreading fake stories about Russia's efforts to improve the situation in Syria including providing assistance to refugees so any support provided to the white helmets by the UN refugee agencies a grave mistake there is an an expression we all know that such serious mistakes are after more than mistakes and we all know that they're extremely dangerous we encourage the UN refugee agency to avoid political bias and remain neutral focusing on the task which is the number-one priority today namely bringing Syrian refugees back to Syria you know we know that there are international organizations supporting the white helmets and when we talk about refugees returning to Syria people who want to come back to Syria somehow nobody wants to help them nobody wants to support this process they say it's too early The Situation's too dangerous sounds funny when people when those people were in Syria in many original countries and international powers sponsored militants the situation was not dangerous and now when people are returned to their homeland they say the situation is too dangerous that just sounds absurd but facts speak for themselves now return to the investigation into the killings of Russian journalists in Central African Republic as you know Russian Foreign Ministry have said many times that we are closely follow situation around the probe into the circumstances surrounding the killing Russian journalists on the 30th of July now we are considering to send to the Republic members of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to follow a monitor of the investigation conducted by Central African authorities some mass media have said already and I can only confirm that that Russian journalists have arrived to the Central African Republic representing different outlets also federal news agency project has been developed there on the 12th of August a number of journalists arrived there during the meeting with the embassy personnel and I'd like to confirm that those who are arriving to this place of the Central African Republic they are doing that constantly maintaining dialogue with the Russian embassy and we do hope that all journalists Russian journalists planning to visit this state will be informing in advance Russian embassy there Russian ambassador's also that should be done when it comes to you in full meaning of the Russian Foreign Ministry so please inform the relevant authorities and Russian embassy as well so we don't really said that their goal was to cover the work of Russian instructors in Central African Republic visiting the training base in Barranca following the route their fallen colleagues didn't make so security of the Russian journalists has been ensured by the local police and UN peacekeeping mission personnel while Russian diplomats in banki also facilitate their work in their investigation we since of the hope that the professional work of journalists will make it possible to add to the clearance of that fog around the circumstances surrounding the killings of Russian journalists and torpedo and debunk the innuendos and fake news that emerged in various Metz media outlets and on the internet regarding what really happened with Russian journalists there their objectives and why they were there at all also that will put an end we hope to many speculations regarding who is behind that killing that's to our mind is to be complimentary factor which would facilitate the investigation conducted by the Central African authorities and Russian relevant bodies which was launched immediately after the incident the whole picture will be presented by the official investigation conducted again I'd like to say that by the Russian and Central African relevant bodies but certainly jaundice will contribute to that process and to its results letting everyone know the truth about what really happened to Russian journalists now I would like to turn to the Russians who are being kept prisoners under some pretext and that is Mary Bettina she was arrested on the 15th of July in the United States and trumped-up charges of reportedly acting as an action of a foreign government were pressed against her and you know the consequences Russian diplomats in Washington succeeded and securing better inconsideration conditions now she can use telephone she has better food now but at the same time despite multiple requests the regime of her incarceration is quite a severe one which resulted in undermining her health it seems that they are trying to complicate her life as much as possible and force her in that way to cooperate with investigation we think with such actions of the US are inadmissible we demand that she is given full medical help immediately and also the United States should put an end to that criminal action because it is has been started on charges which were put out of a hat I can say nothing else what they say stands to no criticism now we turn to kill Wyszynski as the Russian embassy in Ukraine has the hair sown arbitrary code 3 two years Hayes time under investigation and prison and now he'll be kept for less than 60 days the same time they refuse to let him go our embassy personnel have been denied the opportunity to meet with a Russian citizen we still continue to monitor the situation closely and we facilitate as much as possible the defense actions of the team we've helped him on the 27th of August and that is a very forthcoming news we'll be celebrating the 100th anniversary of logic boat service so you know that they will come in a couple of weeks so it will be the exact date but we can say it at this very day that 100 years ago the Russians people commiserate for International Affairs created the diplomatic pouch desk which was responsible for ensuring secure and confidential mass engine with Russian representatives abroad well it's a bit too early to congratulate our colleagues but we are ready to do that and we will do that later on but here the eve of that wonderful day I would like to say a couple of words about the diplomatic courier service it is a very important link in the diplomatic chain because they are responsible for the safety and protection of secrets of State and the most vivid example of heroism exercised by Russian deep couriers is the one done by Te'o donation Juergen MacMaster who back in February 1926 were delivering diplomatic pouch from Moscow to Berlin coming through Riga on the 5th of February they were attacked in a train the goal of that attack was to get the boat away from them was a shootout theater net resisting the bandit was killed in action while Jurgen McMaster left to tell the tale he had three words but he kept and his protection the poach until he arrived to Riga he both were awarded the order of the red banner streets rustles and aircrafts aircraft were named after them and even a film was screened to honor their memory it will be screened on the 27th of August by the Suez da TV channel their feed of valor and courage back in the 1926 it's not something out of the ordinary that's just an ordinary life for those who work with that service throughout the Second World War diplomatic curious were standing and carrying mail across the front line using Russian and air light aircraft and vessels to do that lately they've been delivering pouches to the countries and merged in conflicts and blood such as Afghanistan Mozambique Lebanon Syria another place the memorial plate dedicated to the following Foreign Ministries of personnel and you know that it's stationed in the whole of the foreign ministry in Moscow sees one-third of all the names belonging to diplomatic careers throughout least 100 years lived through many structure on functional changes but it never lost its eye professionalism and reliability of people who have been serving for 100 years changing one another on this path now we have radio and internet but still Diplomatic Service is as important as ever it's one of the most reliable ways of delivering messages documents papers successful completion of that surface depends on the talented personnel they have received a lot of state awards plumbers and certificates many of them are now concerts they had of departments he workers in international realization starting from the year 2000 third this is a separate department of the minister Foreign Affairs Department for diplomatic and career connection and mass engine we have a lot of other ministries relying on the hour on our careers currently we are sending our chorus to over 120 states across the world it's also say that now it's been the department's been headed by Sergey Loki on chica and voi extraordinary and plenipotentiary and the next briefing will take place in Moscow and on the 23rd of August at 11 o'clock we will be opening a theme exhibition to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Russian diplomatic service anniversary and during that briefing and before it we will allow the accredited journalists to visit the exhibition and well prepare some reports and stories lying on that material we will be giving you as per that exhibition it will be a wonderful event I promise there you will see the very diplomatic luggage and bags used for delivering messages and you'll be told about every aspect of Korea's life and work and service if you cannot come we will be passed in everything online now we turn to other issues are the points on our agendas and that is Afghanistan with much concern we've been seeing the development of events in the Ghazni province Afghanistan Talib today have secured a major part of the gazni city hundreds of people died on both sides civilians have died too unfortunately big part of the city had been devastated demolished the authorities saying that the Talib's are retreating from the city but still they are holding the neighboring counties we see that there is an increase in tensions in the northern provinces including because of the attacks of the talipes launched against the Afghan army base in the county of goal match for RIA province last Sunday at least 17 soldiers were killed and 20 were wounded in action starting from the 2008 we've seen a number of hostilities in different parts of country's army and police having a hard time securing the control situation but they cannot win even with the help of the international community's forces present in the country partly because the partly because of the story state of the economy and the World Bank has issued a report saying that there is a clear slowdown in economic growth low rate of job creation a lot of people live below the poverty line up to 55 percent of population there are no prospects for any better as for the territorial dispute regarding the Western Sahara it is also a huge issue and the former is Spanish colonies being a point of much concern for decades United Nations have been trying to settle this conflict between the Polisario Front and Moroka but these summits and meetings have been torpedoed many times there is a fragile state of school in place but still it is very concerning because there is much potential for further challenges to the inter no security we see that upon the personal instruction of the general secretary of annotations mr. Keller from Germany's presidents is working actively to ensure a direct dialogue without any precondition between the two parties engaging Algerian and Mauretania parties as observers we see no alternative to finding a compromise basing on the resolution of the UN Security Council and UN General Assembly following the procedures which comply in full with UN Charter principles and objectives we think that the lasting peace in West Sahara can be secured but only through political means we will continue keeping in contact with all the engaged parties facilitating the deposit of development in this area next to Salisbury and Amesbury of course we are concerned by the lack of information about the condition of us people and her father their whereabouts and of course we are amazed that the British authorities continue to refuse to provide access for Russian consular officers to them the United Kingdom continues to ignore demands by the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation sent to London on March 16th in connection with the criminal investigation regarding the attack on us cripple this is the official charge politicians in the United States took advantage of the provocation staged with respect to Russian citizens in Salisbury announcing new round of anti-russian sanctions we believe these step is politically biased motivated this is very much like the situation that took place decade ago with the supposedly chemical weapons in Iraq when the United Kingdom supported the United States without having any actual evidence instead fabricated evidence was offered fake evidence so it seems like this time neither London nor Washington has learned the lesson of what happened with Iraq but I can assure you that this time reputational losses will be much much serious for these hasty actions making the situation even worse investigation in Salisbury Amesbury is conducted under heavy political for Russia from the British government which has and actually the United States government as well the British government gave the guilty verdict long time before the official investigation was concluded in fact we don't even know at this point when this investigation will be concluded in any way the guilty verdict has been given already and now that Washington has imposed new sanctions this pressure is even stronger Russia continues to insist on transparent objective unbiased investigation of those incidents we emphasize that it was a Russian citizens who suffered in Salisbury and we will not stay away from this matter we demand access to our people staying on this subject I would like to point out to you that there was an article an article that we saw it was published in The Telegraph it's an article by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom Wood Johnson he encourages London to follow in the footsteps of Washington and withdraw from the joint comprehensive plan of action on the Iranian nuclear program so it seems like the u.s. Ambassador just couldn't stay away from this subject he had to get involved so he talks about cyber attacks against Western democracies without offering any evidence so he said that the UK should join the United States and in its policy against the Iranian nuclear deal he also says in the piece that the only reasonable plan of action is to tear up the deal with Iran saying and here is a direct quote the US and UK together can secure peace and prosperity in Iran's something that the whole world is looking forward to this is just absurd the United States has been saying nobody should interfere in the internal affairs of other countries this is something they have been talking about for a very long time no interference in elections no interference in internal affairs respect the sovereignty of other countries so here is the US ambassador to the UK saying and I quote the US and the UK together can secure peace and prosperity in Iran in Iran something that the whole world is looking for so somebody the US ambassador thinks that Washington and London have the responsibility on securing peace and prosperity for Tehran this is just absurd and this is not it yet we have repeatedly said that we are concerned by the decision of the United States to withdraw from the joint comprehensive plan of action as a key element of the global non-proliferation regime and the cornerstone of security in the Middle East this is our position and the international community has supported this through the UN Security Council resolution which has mandatory force so we think the this approach is represented by the US ambassador to the UK and other US politicians a mistake we believe this is irresponsible especially with regards to nuclear security comments by Wood Johnson are absolutely out of place and inappropriate what the United States is doing is destabilizing the situation in Iran through illegitimate economic sanctions the most cynical thing about this is that they talk about peace and prosperity in the Middle East the UK and the u.s. doing that tell me when was the last time that the US and the UK were able to secure peace and prosperity in the Middle East please tell me if there is a spot in the Middle East and in northern Africa and Oasis where this tandem succeeded in securing peace and prosperity maybe Libya maybe Syria maybe Yemen what else the Arab Spring the region barely escaped disastrous consequences that the Arab Spring could have the track record the recent history of the region what the US and the UK did there just tells us otherwise tells us this won't work so once again I say that we shouldn't even take this seriously when he says the whole world's looking forward to no they're not authorized to secure peace and prosperity for other countries also we had a few questions a request to comment on the US defense budget we will really commented on this a little now I'd like to say a few words in more detail the US presidents side the new bill on August 13th on defense spending for 2019 for the 2019 fiscal year reinforcing Washington's dominant position in the international arena through military build-up unprecedented pumping of the defense budget to 716 billion US dollars this is a record in the last 15 years this will have a devastating effect on the existing system of international security this budget allocates funds for some specific anti-russian and anti-chinese projects as reflected in the national security strategy national defense strategy and the Nuclear Posture review running down this new bill which is named after Senator McCain dyed-in-the-wool ERISA folks extends the ban on military cooperation with Russia and this given serious challenges and threats that the world faces today the the bill approved six point three billion dollars which is 1.7 billion dollars more than last year for the European deterrence initiative beefing up US military presence in Europe in order to supposedly counter Russian aggression there are other Russian elements in the bill for example the bill emphasizes that the u.s. may suspend its participation in the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty because allegedly Russia has broken the terms of this treaty the u.s. plans to beef up the European segment of the u.s. global missile defense system to protect it from Russian missiles which supposedly do not comply with the terms of the INF treaty they referred to the fact that Russia allegedly violated the treaty on open skies and though blocks cooperation under this treaty as well this will endanger not only us crews but also Russian representatives on board next they reaffirmed their commitment to developing their global missile shield and deploying weapons in space other measures targeting Russia and other countries there are plans to produce tactical nuclear weapons or so-called small nuclear weapons lowering the nuclear threshold no sonic weapons as part of the prompt Global Strike also there is a section talking about lethal weapons provided as a de to the poroshenko regime in Ukraine the country that is currently in a state of civil war essentially this certainly plays into the hands of the Ukrainian politicians who are not interested in resolving the dog bus inflicted an early date for all part we will take all necessary measures to provide for our security using all political and diplomatic and military means available to us also we received a few questions but comments by some NATO members their reaction on the Euro reaction to the u.s. increasing its defense spending the NATO summit which took place in July reaffirmed the commitment of the NATO member states to spend two percent of their GDP of defense this despite the fact that the defence budget of NATO exceeds the Russian defence budget by the factor of 14 and some countries even proposed raising this number to four percent and of course not all countries are happy with that especially considered the trade wars happening today whose number only Lucy appreciate Lonnie Romero's with the some countries this shift will leave them with more guns then products especially when you consider that Russia does not pose a threat to NATO members steps and there are no threats in Europe that would require military response at the same time there are a few countries that tried protecting their national interests on the other and there are countries that look pretty much like they're fighting windmills non-existing threats the their real goals scoring some political points or actually making money we don't know what their real purpose is but this will not certain this will certainly not strengthen security in Europe on the country to lovely create additional risks also many mass media outlets experts in just lame public have been asking about the Russian Greek relations and suggestions surrounding what has happening we've been seeing out of article dedicated to that issue out of fake news also which resonate through the media space so I would like to dwell on this issue right now we've familiarize ourselves with the foreign ministry of greece commentary dated 10th of august this year regarding the current state of affairs in the relation between russia and greece we see that some partners are trying to degrade the level of relations russia has been treating this relation with greece as traditionally friendly and now these relations are being called by some as just routine coexistence this does not meet the interests of the two people and our respect we have an oppressor dented level of political Dalek at the highest levels and the major project we'll be implementing together lately it has been a Paragon for our European partners because these relations with Greece have been friendly open and contentful unfortunately that cooperation is degrading and this year we celebrate the 100 a 19th anniversary of establish antibiotic relations which is lamentable it is lamentable to see such degradation we've been respecting the dependency of Greece and his son need sovereignty contributing to it back in the history as well as it was the case whereas Byzantium we never interfered in the domestic affairs of Greece or its internal policies if they want to say it has been like that it means that those people are not friends of Russia and Greece the charges pressed by Athens are unfounded no evidence has been presented to us local media have been developing a discrimination campaign against our bilateral ties in the field of cultural material cooperation and unyielding positive vibes have been turning into something else no one ever doubted the high quality of our relations though they were an example to others no one ever considered decreasing their importance but now it looks like a hybrid warfare it is highly suspicious and evil-minded attempt we see that many now try to also defame the billets of our relations which is one the same religion our historical friendship contribution of our societies and people-to-people relations Russia has been reprimanded and rebuked for unfounded infringement upon the interests of Greece in the Balkans and allergic undermining the Pressman agreement on Macedonia the name of Macedonia we've seen a lot of articles which were faithful for sure that Moscow is allergic Lee financing mouth new thousand people's John rallies before the International Exhibition and salon occurs this is simply ridiculous it is a huge media campaign orchestrated by someone we are not building friendship of someone against someone else never ever and some try to convince them what will we do exactly that for instance our cooperation with Turkey is not directed against any third country no one should twist the history and twist the minds of people let's take the example of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine society which just as many other non government organization conduct the projects for the betterment of a cultural and educational cooperation and they do that only when their partners are willing to cooperate and then and that organization is being criticized right now too does not Russia has initiated these steps undermining the quality of our relations quite on the contrary we adhere to the multilateral cooperation with Greece this situation is abnormal and we hope it is temporal and we do hope that will overcome it soon we are ready to exercise patience in order to fully return to the good neighborly level of relations between the states and between the people who also receive much information about key preparing to create their own Magnitsky act well at least it will be resembling it in terms of its contests so they're trying to impose unilateral curse of Massacre undermining the international law and just practice of normal civilized behavior of states it seems that they're following the disruptive influence of the West this way trying to accuse Nationals of other states basing on unsupported evidence and unfounded charges so you know they're acting ruthlessly trying to collectively punish those who are guilty of nothing inclusion of any politicians and and that list will be treating it as a violation of international law and law on the immunity of the officials of sovereign states we believe that this initiative cotton quote is an attempt to further promote impunity sweeping under the carpet the neo-nazi and cream its actions in such places as the ad SC trade union house southeast Ukrainian independence square of cave then return to the destination against russian-speaking population in the Baltic states it's almost a routine now because we almost every day monitor what is happening in that on that track and it is highly problematic because currently we see the squeezing a Russian language away from the public domain for instance in Latvia the government trying to put the education on to the tracks of teaching everything only in the Latvian language the railing Russian language education they are doing that for colleges for schools for universities banning effectively banning Russian language this is a discrimination and we condemn it resolutely and we have many times said that we do not approve of these actions we all remember what people in that fear say they are against it to you fortunately that example of that we a somewhat contagious and before near now also follow suit a group of conservatives have introduced to the same a republic of the only group of a madman planning to increase the percentage of the livonian language in education up to the 60 percent which is undermining the rights of russian-speaking population they say they try to level the opportunities of students but this is hypercritical this is a direct discrimination in broad daylight they try to forcefully assimilate russian-speaking people polish russian-speaking minorities are resolutely against it that bill proposed by the conservatives is certainly a devolution of the state policies and undermines the situation regarding the rights of the minorities it is a clear infringement upon their rights we sit to the hope that the foreign authorities will refrain from acting in such an unpopular way we also have been hearing a lot about the so called preventive conversations with senior school students of russian-speaking schools of Vilnius and other towns during these conversations the official start to probe into the level of loyalty of this students towards livonian state in policies they try to scan them for notebooks published in Russian other banned literature's they say that is hero Pietists 2018 can you imagine also they've been conducting those inquiries and scanning in other places Latvian Estonia stony for instance they have been considering law to increase tenfold defines for legal entities whose employees do not have the necessary command of Estonian the current fine is 600 euros and they plan to increase it up to six thousand four hundred heroes so this is for those who do not know is stone e'en enough can you imagine this I have a question if only Sounion for ''tis when they are considering these initiatives don't they realize that somewhere in the world something may happen to the people who been traditionally speaking Estonian for instance who do not know the language of their country of residence again this is abnormal we call upon the United Nations always see Council of Europe wound up in Union to have a wide way to say and vocally stand against these practices this is a direct discrimination against the national minorities explanation against their languages and their educational rights today we are here on the Baltics the air tech camp but we have some news from the Crimean air sac camp as you all remember one month ago a unique mission to rescue the young food bolused had been successfully conducted they spent a lot of time in the flooded cave we being following the news were suggested that we can could possibly send our help and now specialists many people being standing together with those who were trapped in that cave we all so our hearts conquered by the efforts of the rescuers and these children who were fighting for their survival they came through a lot of trouble and hardship it wasn't a game that was the real-life situation we can only imagine how hard it was for them so to help them come back to normal life and to owner they're strong characters and their courage resilience amid such dire conditions the director of the Artic camp it's now advised this boys to come to the altar camp to join other children from many countries of the world spending their time together going on adventures making friends complimenting their studies with real-life training and people-to-people relations building I would like to send this message from behalf of the director of the our tech camp because that heroic feat and it's truly a feat I think it's similar to what adults do we do you appreciate what they did we believe that the atmosphere in Arctic will help them forget the bad memories not like something which was too bad to remember but to forget how difficult it was to survive those days our tag that CEM has one of the best football teams who currently lead in the Crimean curve so probably for them it will also be an opportunity to play football and we all know that they are footballers everyone willing to come will be giving this opportunity absolutely for free based on the quotas the other cam has for foreign children coming to it relevant bodies of the Russian Federation will contact them officially sending this invitation and arranging the details and now I'm ready to take up your questions if you have any yes please please don't forget to use your mics what's your take on what the United States do and I mean the treaty and open skies because they are banned from flying over the Chechen Republic Kaliningrad and some other parts so how can you comment on that well everything which have to do with the statements of the United States regarding the open sky sweeted has been conducted by mr. Rapp cough deputy foreign minister of the Russian Federation the thing is that if they have any claims or if they feel that they see their rights infringed or that the treaty is not being implemented in full then as the international affairs stand they can address international institutions bilaterally multilaterally they can engage the diplomatic channels or the channel between the relevant bodies and ministers for instance we used to have commissions on different tracks culture armaments mass media commissions but they put all those on a hold but we'll still have institutions in the world which can help us discuss these issues but their goal seems to be quite different they do not want to solve these problems to allay those concerns they want to deepen them and they use the information space to exaggerate this these problems they exaggerate it otherwise they would give us the real statement officially asking us to explain ourselves so this is an information campaign they conduct now against Russia so that's how we see it there is a lot of opportunities to solve these issues in a businesslike manner for instance the meeting of our presidents proved to the whole world that both Russia and the United States can sit at the table for negotiations and talk business and no no one ever doubted that they spent a lot of time to prepare for that meeting our foreign ministers worked hard to arrange the plan of action on Iranian nuclear program and other questions such as Syrian Ukraine we have the dialogue now we have quite a difficult situation that's true but no one doubts that this can be settled but some people don't want to use the channels to solve the problems we have well-established channels which should be engaged and they are not engaged people just come up to the mic and start to say things I would like to clarify something on the US defense budget cutting military cooperation program and one question about sanctions if I'm a trade war between Turkey and United States would you please comment on that well generally speaking I mentioned the Open Skies program and the defense budget for more details please talk to the defense ministry and as to the outcome this is what makes this whole situation so ironic for many years they've been telling us that everything they do with respect to Russia sanction stop lists restrictions these are all punishments this is their response they've assumed the role of the arbitrary global arbiter and they want to punish Russia for doing their own thing for misbehaving and we've been saying that this actually started a long time before a Ukraine and this started with Obama this was a long time the Magnitsky Act this was a long time before Ukraine and now it's clear to everybody Russia is certainly not the only country on those lists we see trade wars with China we see pressure financial economic all sorts of pressure put on Turkey Iran is also under pressure more and more sanctions are imposed on Iran economic policies and tremendous political pressure remember they used to talk about the axis of evil there are certain nations certain countries that somehow because of their history just cannot be good those are rogue nations they are the axis of evil so today in order to pursue your own interests you don't even have to belong to this axis of evil for example the European Union what they do with the European countries these are certainly trade wars it's just a matter of taste if you want to make all this trade Wars or pressure or sanctions whatever you name it but even closest allies of the United States for example Canada can it always supported the United States endorsed everything the US did following in its footsteps and now even Canada is affected by certain decisions made by the United States see the problem is when the u.s. pursues this policy they care about their national interest or not more likely they just pursue the interests of a small group of people that are complete power once every four or eight years the interests which Washington describes it's the u.s. national interests turns around and a completely different thing I now describe is national interests just a few years ago they sought to strengthen trade and partnership with those countries and now they turn everything around and now they say Iran is an aggressor and so on and so forth so I think it's really important for us to understand how these things work okay there is the trade war with Turkey how can Russia benefit from this situation first of all this is a very good question it's not Russia who designed the globalization comes up this is something that came from the West and everybody fell in love with globalization and everybody got involved in this global economic process we see the world as a community where every country can make a contribution and countries can all work together and have access equal access to economic activities but this is not what we see happening to as regards our Russia we'll look at the specific results that come out of these trade wars we've made our choice after sanctions were imposed on Russia we took advantage of the situation faced with this reality faced with these circumstances we made our choice and this enabled our country to develop follow its own path develop internally going forward we'll monitor the situation minimize our losses course it's not like we are happy that the US is now attacking Turkey no this is not how we are no the world is global and when sanctions are imposed in a certain country you can always be hit by the recoil we certainly don't support any such steps we just comment on notes we really do hope that this the this warm continue but at this point it doesn't seem likely good day outlet my question has to do with the movement across the border of Poland and the Kaliningrad region so what do you polish colleagues say regarding this regime on they travel between the two sides of the border well I don't have anything to give you no details but maybe tomorrow I think tomorrow I will be ready to comment on that maybe today but later on in the day mr. Harrer my question has to do with Syria the United Nations say that they are against refugees coming back to Syria why don't they want to agree with the nomination of Judge Syria well I cannot agree with you with the statement that the United Nations are negative when it comes to the determine of the refugees I talked about that today they approach is quite different they say that they're no suitable environment and that must be created for for the return of refugees they see some obstacles on that track and the ongoing military hostilities major devastation general lack of security very dable infrastructure as well as a lot of unexploded ammunition so who is going to reinforce these situation who's going to improve the infrastructure who's going to help Syrians demine the Cherry Russia does that but CMAs themselves should be doing that don't you think so and this is exactly what we would like to say not it Nations has been influenced but major global actors donors of many Rotarians programs such as the United States and other Western states and they've been trying to change the regime in Syria for quite a long time and you familiar with that that is why they are putting forward certain preconditions when it comes to the help delivered to Syria and they try to tie it up with a political transition as they call it which effectively means acid leaving his position and we see you know sanctions they impose toward Syria to achieve these goals and this is a paradox this a war-torn country and they are putting it further on the knees throwing more and more stones at it in the form of sanctions yes this massively impedes the reconstruction major donors having quite a harsh stance and Syrian that is why many UN agencies cannot join their efforts with us and others to help Syria reconstruct the country United Nations refugee agency thinks that there is a number of conditions to be met for the refugees to come back they have some political preconditions - that is why it is hardly possible to say that the UN refugee agency will be participating in the return of refugees unfortunately that is the case but it does not mean that the United Nations are against any steps to normalize the situation in Syria we've been keeping constant dialogue with interested parties who engaged in many talks and meetings mr. Lavrov had a telephone conversation with the General Secretariat Nations quite recently and we work with other agencies to facilitate the comeback of refugees from the neighboring another countries which solved many many issues at this point working very hard Vesta Kaliningrad your preliminary marks you talked about the Eevee's as saying that there will be details available later on on the website so maybe you have any deals now what about Western states being on the list well this information needs to be harmonized by several departments so we will be Boston that later on on the website we still need to finalize this I alone cannot announce it without having every other department agree on the final statement then we'll post it mr. Harun my name is andrey vapors f this is news ball outlet so what are your position on the possible ways to oppose the vandalism and poland and what they do was brought brush related memorials may be they can be created digital map with all the memorials and plates and monuments which has been demolished or will be demolished soon not forgotten and the still existent ones that can be supplied with photos and videos photos of well soldiers who perished there their biographies would be a huge multimedia project available in three languages Russian polish English will that project help to preserve the monuments from being erased from the memory of people I'm not sure about mobile devices if this can affect the position of the Polish authorities I fully support your idea I think there are people working on it already and we are doing everything we can to help create such a database or a virtual map of military monuments in Poland maybe actually we can go beyond Poland in Europe in general but of course especially Poland because of diffuse battles that were fought there during the liberation process and today we talked to participants of the Baltic Artech summer camp young people came up with similar ideas I think we should certainly do that and not just at the government level but also working with NGOs with civil society this should be a grassroots movement and we will provide our support for example our department the department of information and media initiated a special agreement between the Military History Society of Russia and our department working together to prevent vandalization of military monuments and supporting the healthy forces in society that want to preserve military monuments we have this agreement with the Society of military history specifically what can we do if you have been following this subject I talked about this almost every week our embassies are in contact with local authorities they they protest they raise this issue in talks regularly by raising this issue with certain European capitals when they ask how can we prevent people from vandalizing monuments we often tell them and we hope that they were eventually given the current level of technological progress you can install CCTV cameras at least this is what they do in other places so you will be able to investigate those attacks so if a person wants to vandalize monument they will think twice before doing something like that because they will be caught on camera and police will be able to investigate the incident there are CCTV cameras in the cities everywhere so it will be easier to find those people yes there are incidents when monuments are vandalized of course we always work with the local civil societies with there are people in Poland for example who raise funds we support them we help we work with this person in Poland it's not just sounds like we're using software or anything like that no we just want to have somebody working locally in Poland and monuments to Soviet soldiers who gave their lives to save the lives of other people we want to see this work continue what this person does and those who help him we want this we want to help them Network yes we do want to have all those websites something that we really need to do do we have any other questions if now yeah okay I'll take the last question because I was getting ready to leave when talking to young people is this your first time in Kaliningrad actually no this is not my first time I've been here at a couple of times in recent years together with the foreign ministry but he was meeting his counterparts but I was here as a little girl during the Soviet period I think this was in the late 80s and I remember this very I believe this was some ephemeral time dad driving a car my mom and I we came all the way from Moscow to Kaliningrad to this very place for some recreation and we drove back to Moscow so I remember well how it used to look and I'm really impressed with the changes and my childhood memories even though they're very sweet nature and everything but infrastructure wise progress is obvious of course the situation has improved dramatically so maybe I will travel using the same route and come here some other time well if you let me go right now I will have a some time to visit the Museum of amber thank you very much bye bye ends here you
