ADDED SIGNIFICANCE. 
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- PROTECT 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF BOB 
MUELLER. 
SEVERAL REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO 
WERE HERE TODAY SITED SCALIA'S 
DECENT TO JUSTIFY THEIR 
OPPOSITION TO A BILL PROTECTING 
THE SPECIAL COUNCIL WITH ONE 
EVEN SAYING AND I QUOTE, MANY 
OF US THINK WE ARE BOUND BY 
SCALIA'S DECENT. 
AT THE TIME, I JOKED AND SAID 
INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH STARRY 
DECISES. 
GIVEN YOUR VIEWS, WE ARE 
OBVIOUSLY WORRIED THAT YOU WILL 
FEEL BOUND BY THIS DECENT, BY 
ANTON SCALIA, IF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DECIDES TO ATTEMPT TO 
FIRE THIS SPECIAL COUNCIL, BOB 
MUELLER. 
IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. 
YOU SITED SCALIA'S DECENT IN 
THE CASE INVOLVING THE CONSUMER 
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, 
WHERE YOU GUTTED THAT AGENCY. 
IN THE 2011 SKY CASE, YOU 
DESCENDED FROM A DECISION 
UPHOLDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE 
ACT, AND MADE BREATHTAKING -- 
WHICH HAS BEEN REPEATED OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN AND YOU SAID 
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, THE 
PRESIDENT MAY DECLINE TO 
ENFORCE A STATUTE THAT 
REGULATES PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DEEMS THE 
STATUTE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
EVEN IF A COURT HAS HELD OR 
WOULD HOLD THE STATUTE 
CONSTITUTIONAL. 
YOUR WORDS. 
OF COURSE, THE UNITARY 
EXECUTIVE THEORY WAS THE BASIS 
FOR PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECEMBER 
30, 2005 SIGNING STATEMENT 
CLAIMING THE AUTHORITY TO 
OVERRIDE THE McCAIN TORTURE 
AMENDMENT. 
YESTERDAY, I ASKED WHAT 
COMMENTS YOU MADE AS PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S STAFF SECRETARY. 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN ASKED A 
SIMILAR QUESTION THIS MORNING. 
WHAT YOU TOLD ME WAS I CAN'T 
RECALL WHAT I SAID. 
I DO RECALL THERE WAS A GOOD 
DEAL INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THAT 
SIGNING STATEMENT, AS YOU CAN 
IMAGINE. 
I DO REMEMBER IT WOULD BE 
CONTROVERSIAL INTERNALLY. 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE YOU CAN'T 
REMEMBER THAT CONTROVERSIAL 
ISSUE. 
GIVEN OUR CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR 
VIEWS ON EXECUTIVE POWER, IT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR YOU AT THIS 
MOMENT, PLEASE, TO CLARIFY FOR 
US THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY 
IN THIS AGE OF DONALD TRUMP. 
>>  SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
COMMENTS ABOUT MY WIFE AND 
DAUGHTERS. 
MY DAUGHTERS WILL RETURN THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
THEY WILL EXPERIENCE DEMOCRACY 
ONCE AGAIN IN ACTION. 
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. 
ON MORRISON VERSUS OLSON, A 
COUPLE THINGS AT THE OUTSET. 
FIRST, THAT CASE DID NOT 
INVOLVE THE SPECIAL COUNCIL 
SYSTEM. 
I HAVE WRITTEN REPEATEDLY, THAT 
THE TRADITIONAL SPECIAL COUNSEL 
SYSTEM, WHICH WE HAVE NOW, AND 
HAVE HAD HISTORICALLY, IS A 
DISTINCT SYSTEM APPOINTED BY 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, MORRISON 
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. 
THAT DEALT WITH THE INDEPENDENT 
STATUTE, AS YOU SAID, WHICH IS 
EXPIRED IN 1999, UNDER 
OVERWELMING CONSENSUS, THAT 
STATUTE WAS INAPPROPRIATE, 
UNRESTRAINED, UNACCOUNTABLE, AS 
YOU SAID. 
SECONDLY, MORRISON, JUSTICE 
SCALIA, THAT DOES -- HUMPHREY'S 
EXECUTIVE IS THE SUPREME COURT 
PRECEDENT THAT ALLOWS 
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO EXIST. 
THOSE INDEPENDENT REGULATORY 
AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EXIST, OF 
COURSE, SO BOTH ON THE 
INDEPENDENT AGENCY SIDE, THOSE 
ARE UNAFFECTED. 
ON THE SPECIAL COUNSEL SIDE, 
THAT'S UNAFFECTED. 
YOU MENTIONED THE CFPB CASE. 
MY DECISION IN THAT CASE WOULD 
HAVE ALLOWED THAT AGENCY TO 
CONTINUE OPERATING AND 
PERFORMING IMPORTANT OPERATIONS 
FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS. 
THE ONLY CORRECTION WOULD HAVE 
BEEN IN THE STRUCTURE. 
IT WAS A NOVEL STRUCTURE UNLIKE 
ANY OTHER INDEPENDENT AGENCY 
THAT HAD BEEN CREATED 
PREVIOUSLY. 
AS TO THE CONCEPT OF PROSECUTE 
DISCRETION, THAT IS RECOGNIZED 
IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 
THE LIMITS ARE UNCERTAIN. 
THAT'S RISEN IN THE IMMIGRATION 
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
THERE ARE DEBATES ABOUT WHAT 
THE LIMITS ARE. 
THE BASIC CONCEPT OF DISCRETION 
IS ALL I WAS REFERRING TO 
THERE. 
I'VE MADE CLEAR IN MY WRITINGS, 
THAT A COURT ORDER THAT 
REQUIRES A PRESIDENT TO DO 
SOMETHING OR PROHIBITS A 
PRESIDENT FROM DOING SOMETHING 
UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS 
OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE 
FINAL WORD IN OUR SYSTEM. 
OUR SEPARATION OF POWER SYSTEM. 
WHICH IS COOPER VERSUS AARON. 
THAT IS UNITED STATES VERSUS 
RICHARD NIXON. 
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE. 
FINALLY, THE QUESTION OF WHO 
CONTROLS THE EXECUTIVE POWER 
WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, 
THE VERTICAL QUESTION, YOU HAVE 
THE PRESIDENT AT THE TOP. 
YOU HAVE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES, 
WHICH EXIST WITH PRECEDENT, IS 
DISTINCT FROM THE QUESTION OF 
WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE 
EXECUTIVE POWER. 
ON THAT LADDER QUESTION, THE 
SCOPE OF EXECUTIVE POWER, I 
HAVE MADE CLEAR, AND THE 
CONTEXT OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 
THE YOUNGSTOWN FRAMEWORK, 
CONTEXT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, 
MY CASES QUESTIONING UNILATERAL 
EXECUTIVE REWRITING OF THE LAW. 
IN THE CRIMINAL LAW, WHERE I 
REVERSED CONVICTIONS, I AM ONE 
NOT AFRAID AT ALL THROUGH MY 
RECORD OF 12 YEARS TO 
INVALIDATE EXECUTIVE POWER. 
>>  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
YOU REFERRED TO THE YOUNGSTOWN 
CASE. 
IN THE CONTEXT OF A WAR AND A 
DECISION BY A WAR THAT WAS 
UNPOPULAR, AND THE DECISION, OR 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN POPULAR, I 
SHOULD SAY, AND THE DECISION OF 
THE SUPREME COURT WHICH WAS 
UNPOPULAR AT THAT MOMENT IN 
HISTORY. 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO ASK YOU IS 
IN HISTORIC CONTEXT, DO YOU 
UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE NOW? 
WHEN BOOKS ARE BEING WRITTEN, 
HOW DEMOCRACY DIES, WHEN FEAR 
OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE AND CAN 
THE EXPANSION OF THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH IS RAMPANT IN THIS 
COUNTRY, WHEN ILLUSTRATIONS OF 
IT ARE FOUND AROUND THE WORLD, 
WHY WE ARE ASKING YOU OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN, GIVE US SOME 
REASSURANCE ABOUT YOUR 
COMMITMENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS OF THIS COUNTRY IN 
THE FACE OF A PRESIDENT WHO 
SEEMS PREPARED TO CAST THEM 
ASIDE. 
WHETHER IT'S VOTER SUPPRESSION, 
THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA, CASE 
AFTER CASE, WE HEAR THIS 
PRESIDENT WILLING TO WALK AWAY 
FROM THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
THAT'S THE HISTORIC CONTEXT, 
WHICH THIS IS IN. 
NOT A PARTICULAR CASE, BUT A 
PARTICULAR MOMENT IN HISTORY. 
>>  MY 12 YEAR RECORD SHOWS AND 
MY STATEMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE 
SHOW AND ALL MY TEACHING AND 
ARTICLES SHOW MY COMMITMENT TO 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
JUDICIARY, AS THE CROWN JEWEL 
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. 
MY SITING OF JUSTICE KENNEDY 
FOR WHOM I WORKED. 
WHO LEFT US A LEGACY OF 
LIBERTY, BUT ALSO A LEGACY OF 
ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW IN THE 
UNITED STATES. 
THAT'S A FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE 
THAT I TALKED ABOUT COMING FROM 
FEDERAL OF 69, COMING FROM THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
WE'RE ALL EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW 
IN THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 
AND I MADE CLEAR MY DEEP FAITH 
IN THE JUDICIARY. 
THE JUDICIARY HAS BEEN THE 
FINAL GUARANTOR OF THE RULE OF 
LAW. 
AS I SAID IN MY OPENING, THE 
SUPREME COURT IS THE LAST LINE 
OF DEFENSE FROM THE SEPARATION 
OF POWERS BY THE LAWS OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
>>  YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY THE 
UNITARY THEORY OF THE EXECUTIVE 
IS SO WORRISOME. 
WHAT YOU SAID IS WHAT I WANT TO 
HEAR, FROM A COEQUAL AND 
IMPORTANT BRANCH OF OUR 
GOVERNMENT. 
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IN 
RELATION TO MORRISON SUGGESTS 
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE LAST 
WORD. 
>>  I HAVE NOT SAID THAT, 
SENATOR, AND I WILL REITERATE 
SOMETHING I SAID A MINUTE AGO 
COMING FROM COOPER VERSUS 
AARON, COMING FROM MARBURRY, 
WHEN A COURT ORDER REQUIRES A 
PRESIDENT TO DO SOMETHING OR 
PROHIBITS A PRESIDENT FROM 
DOING SOMETHING UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION LAWS OF THE UNITED 
STATES, UNDER OUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, THAT IS 
THE FINAL WORD. 
>>  LET ME ASK YOU ONE LAST 
TIME. 
THE QUESTION YOU KNEW I'D ASK 
ABOUT YOUR TESTIMONY IN 2006. 
I AM STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT 
THAT WHEN I ASK YOU ABOUT THIS 
ISSUE OF DETENTION, 
INTERROGATION, AND TORTURE, YOU 
GAME SUCH A SIMPLE DECLARATIVE 
ANSWER TO ME AND SAID THAT I 
WAS NOT INVOLVED AND I'M NOT 
INVOLVED IN THE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE RULES GOVERNING DETENTION 
OF COMBATANTS. 
WE HAVE FOUND THREE SPECIFIC 
EXAMPLES WHERE YOU WERE. 
THREE. 
YOUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE 
ACCESS TO COUNSEL FOR 
DETAINEES. 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASES, AND 
YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S SIGNING STATEMENT ON THE 
McCAIN TORTURE AMENDMENT. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU SAY THAT 
WORDS MATTER. 
YOU CLAIM TO BE A -- BUT YOU 
DON'T WANT TO BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PLAIN 
MEANING OF YOUR OWN WORDS. 
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR YOU 
TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR RESPONSE TO 
THE QUESTION AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT AT LEAST YOUR ANSWER WAS 
MISLEADING, IF NOT WRONG. 
>>  SENATOR, YOU HAD A CONCERN 
AT THE TIME OF THE 2006 
HEARING, WHICH WAS 
UNDERSTANDABLE. 
WHETHER I HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN 
CRAFTING THE POLICIES, 
INTERROGATION POLICIES, THAT 
WERE SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT THE 
LEGAL MEMOS HAD BEEN WRITTEN 
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
THAT WERE VERY  CONTROVERSIAL. 
AS YOU KNEW, TWO JUDICIAL 
NOMINEES TO THE COURTS OF 
APPEALS HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN 
WORKING ON SOME OF THE MEMOS 
RELATED TO THAT PROGRAM. 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN LED THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATION OF THAT MATTER. 
PRODUCED A MASSIVE REPORT. 
LARGE UNCLASSIFIED REPORT AND 
APPARENTLY, EVEN LARGER 
CLASSIFIED REPORT. 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICE 
OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
PRODUCED A LONG REPORT ABOUT 
ALL THE LAWYERS WHO ARE 
INVOLVED. 
I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN CRAFTING. 
>>  YOU DO DENY BEING INVOLVED 
IN THE THREE AREAS, WHICH I 
JUST READ TO YOU? 
DO YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THE PADILLA CASES, 
THAT YOU WEREN'T INVOLVED IN 
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ACCESS 
TO COUNSEL FOR DETAINEES, YOU 
WEREN'T INVOLVED IN PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S DECISION ON A SIGNING 
STATEMENT ON THE TORTURE 
AMENDMENT. 
ARE YOU SAYING NONE OF THOSE 
THINGS OCCURRED? 
>>  WHAT I MADE CLEAR IS I 
UNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION THEN 
AND KY  -- I STILL UNDERSTAND 
IT NOW. 
TO BE ABOUT THOSE LEGAL MEMOS. 
I WAS NOT READ INTO THAT 
PROGRAM. 
I WAS NOT INVOLVED. 
MY NAME DOES NOT APPEAR IN 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S REPORT. 
>>  THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION I 
ASKED. 
DO YOU DENY THE THREE SPECIFIC 
INSTANCES WHERE YOU WERE 
INVOLVED IN QUESTIONS INVOLVING 
DETENTION AND INTERROGATION? 
>>  THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT 
I SAW THAT YOU ASKED AT THE 
TIME OF THAT HEARING. 
AND MY ANSWER WAS THEN AND IS 
NOW, AS SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S 
REPORT SHOWS AND AS THE 
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
REPORT SHOWS, I WAS NOT READ 
INTO THAT PROGRAM. 
>>  I DIDN'T ASK YOU ABOUT THAT 
PROGRAM. 
>>  FEINSTEIN IS MY DEFENSE, 
SHE CAME TO MY RESCUE. 
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING 
ELSE. 
I ASKED YOU ABOUT THREE 
SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHERE WE 
HAVE WRITTEN PROOF AND SWORN 
TESTIMONY FROM EWE NOW THAT YOU 
WERE INVOLVED IN THESE THREE 
THINGS, ALL OF THEM RELATE TO 
DETENTION AND INTERROGATION, 
WHEN YOU GAVE ME YOUR ASSURANCE 
YOU WEREN'T INVOLVED IN. 
>>  SENATOR, I'M GOING TO 
DISTINGUISH TWO THINGS. 
ONE, WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ME IN 
2006 AND MY TESTIMONY THEN WAS 
ACCURATE AND WAS THE TRUTH. 
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME NOW IS, 
FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE SIGNING 
STATEMENT, AS WE DISCUSSED IN 
YOUR OFFICE. 
I MADE CLEAR THAT, OF COURSE, 
AS STAFF SECRETARY, EVERYTHING 
THAT WENT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR 
A THREE YEAR PERIOD, WITH A FEW 
COVERT EXCEPTIONS WOULD HAVE 
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY FROM 
THE COUNCIL'S OFFICE, OR THE 
POLICY ADVISER, OR WHEREVER IT 
WAS GOING, AND WOULD HAVE MADE 
ITS WAY TO THE PRESIDENT'S 
DESK. 
THAT INCLUDES THAT SIGNING 
STATEMENT. 
>>  LET ME CLOSE. 
I DON'T THINK THE STAFF 
SECRETARY TO THE UNITED STATES 
PRESIDENT IS A FILE CLERK. 
WHAT YOU HAVE EXPLAINED TO US 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THIS WAS A 
MOMENT IN YOUR PUBLIC CAREER. 
YOU WERE GIVEN CONSTITUTIONAL 
ISSUE ADVICE AS WELL AS MAKING 
CHANGES IN DRAFTS THAT WERE 
HEADED FOR THE PRESIDENT'S 
DESK. 
AND ONE OF THEM INVOLVED JOHN 
McCAIN'S TORTURE AMENDMENT. 
THAT TO ME IS INVOLVED DIRECTLY 
ON DETENTION AND INTERROGATION. 
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY -- 
>>  SPEAK TO THAT, THEN WE'LL 
GO TO SENATOR LEE. 
>>  IN RESPONSE TO HIS 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JUDICIARY, 
THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY, HE 
GAVE ME A BOOK WHEN WE MET, 
BIOGRAPHY OF JOHNSON. 
AFTER A LOT OF SENATE MEETINGS 
AND PRACTICE SESSIONS. 
I WENT HOME AND READ THE WHOLE 
THING. 
AND I APPRECIATE IT. 
IT'S A GOOD MODEL. 
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. 
IT'S A GREAT STORY ABOUT 
SOMEONE WHO WAS A JUDGE IN THE 
SOUTH, IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA 
WHO STOOD FIRM FOR THE RULE OF 
LAW. 
A GOOD MODEL. 
I THANK SENATOR DURBIN FOR 
GIVING ME THE BOOK. 
>>  THANK YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THE NATIONALS WEREN'T PLAYING 
THAT NIGHT. 
>>  YES.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS 
TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS. 
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS 
LAST LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM 
SENATOR DURBIN. 
SENATOR DURBIN AND I, 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT WE 
COME FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY, WE SHARE MANY 
VIEWS IN COMMON, AND THIS IS 
ONE AREA, INDEFINITE DETENTION, 
WHERE HE AND I ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT NOT OVER 
REACHING. 
ONLY AS I LOOK AT THIS, I THINK 
THIS CUTS INTO YOUR FAVOR, NOT 
AGAINST YOU. 
TELL ME IF I AM MISSING 
SOMETHING. 
IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHAT YOU 
WERE ASKED ABOUT WAS WHETHER OR 
NOT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN 
CRAFTING THE POLICIES THAT 
WOULD GOVERN DETENTION OF ENEMY 
COMBATANTS, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  THAT WAS A CLASSIFIED 
PROGRAM, CLASSIFIED AT A HIGH 
LEVEL, SUCH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE 
HAD TO HAVE BEEN READ INTO THAT 
PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THAT PROCESS. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>>  I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT. 
READ IN. 
I WASN'T NECESSARILY USING THE 
FORMAL SENSE OF THAT. 
WHAT I MEANT IS, I WAS NOT PART 
OF THAT PROGRAM. 
>>  OKAY. 
THAT IS A BINARY ISSUE. 
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THAT POLICY OR 
YOU WERE NOT. 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>> AND YOU WERE NOT. 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  AND TIM FLANIGAN, WHO WAS 
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL. 
>>  HE WAS THE DEPUTY COUNCIL. 
>>  HAS CONFIRMED YOU WERE NOT 
INVOLVED IN THAT. 
WE HAVE YOUR WORD AND THE WORD 
OF THE THEN DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE 
COUNCIL. 
THEN, THERE IS A SEPARATE 
ISSUE. 
I GUESS ONE COULD ARGUE A 
RELATED ISSUE. 
A SEPARATE ISSUE -- 
>>  I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH 
IT, HE SAID I'M NOT READ INTO 
IT. 
I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. 
>>  I ASSUME THAT WON'T BE 
COUNTED AGAINST ME. 
I'LL HAVE TO SPEAK MORE 
QUICKLY. 
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BEING READ 
INTO, THAT IS A TERM WE 
SOMETIMES REFER TO AS 
GOVERNMENT SPEAK, THAT TALKS 
ABOUT BEING CLEARED TO DISCUSS 
CERTAIN CLASSIFIED MATTERS. 
IN ANY EVENT, YOU WERE NOT 
BROUGHT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
THIS POLICY. 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  SECONDLY, THERE WAS A 
SEPARATE ARGUABLY RELATED, BUT 
A DISTINCT ISSUE INVOLVING A 
MEETING WHERE YOU WERE ASKED 
FOR YOUR OPINION ABOUT HOW 
JUSTICE KENNEDY MIGHT REACT TO 
CERTAIN LEGAL ARGUMENTS THAT 
PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION 
WERE PUSHING. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  YOU ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. 
>>  I SAID THAT INDEFINITE DI 
TENSION OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 
WITHOUT ACCESS TO A LAWYER, 
WHICH AT THE TIME, WAS 
HAPPENING IN THAT PARTICULAR 
CASE, WOULD NEVER FLY WITH 
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 
>>  AND I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH 
YOU ON THAT. 
IT SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY 
UNREMARKABLE PROPOSITION TO ME. 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE DISPUTES 
THAT ARGUMENT HAD PROBLEMS WITH 
IT. 
THAT ARGUMENT WOULDN'T FLY WITH 
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 
AND I THEREFORE HAVE DIFFICULTY 
SEEING HOW THIS CUTS AGAINST 
YOU. 
AS SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN 
CIVIL LIBERTIES AND SHARES MANY 
OF THE SAME CONCERNS THAT HAVE 
BEEN EXPRESSED BY MANY OF MY 
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES. 
THE ADVICE WAS ACCURATE. 
I BELIEVE IT WAS GOOD ADVICE. 
IT CERTAINLY IS NOT 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE STATEMENT 
YOU PROVIDED. 
WHICH WAS THAT YOU WERE NOT 
INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
THE POLICY GOVERNING THE 
PROGRAM. 
SOMETIMES AS LAWYERS, WE'RE 
CALLED UPON TO OFFER LITIGATION 
STRATEGY. 
SOMETIMES WE'RE CALLED UPON TO 
HANDLE LITIGATION. 
OTHER TIMES, AS LAWYERS IN THE 
GOVERNMENT, WE MIGHT BE CALLED 
UPON TO DEVELOP A POLICY. 
HERE, YOU WERE NEITHER INVOLVED 
IN DEVELOPING THE POLICY OR 
HANDLING IT DIRECTLY. 
YOU WENT TO A MEETING, SOMEONE 
ASKED THE QUESTION, YOU GAVE 
THE ANSWER. 
>>  IT WAS ABOUT SOMETHING 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT 
POLICY. 
>>  SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM 
THAT POLICY. 
IT WAS ABOUT A LITIGATING 
POSITION THAT DEALT SORT OF IN 
THE SAME UNIVERSE, BUT NOT WITH 
THAT POLICY. 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>  I THEREFORE HAVE GRAVE 
DIFFICULTY IN SEEING YOU DID 
ANYTHING BUT THE RIGHT THING 
AND YOU ANSWERED THIS QUESTION 
IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN WITH THE 
TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND 
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. 
LET ME TURN NEXT, WHILE WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT COLLEAGUES WITH 
WHOM I OFTEN AGREE AND WITH 
WHOM I OFTEN WORK ACROSS THE 
AISLE. 
SENATOR BOOKER IS A GOOD FRIEND 
OF MINE AND HE IS A COLLEAGUE. 
HE AND I WORK TOGETHER ON A LOT 
OF ISSUES. 
HE RAISED AN ISSUE LAST NIGHT 
THAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON WITH 
YOU. 
HE RAISED AN ISSUE RELATED TO 
SOME E-MAILS. 
I WAS CONCERNED AT THE TIME 
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE E-
MAILS IN FRONT OF YOU. 
AND I THINK THAT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR ANY WITNESS IN 
ANY PROCEEDING TO BE GIVEN 
ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS. 
DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PREPARED 
SOME 18 YEARS AGO. 
YOU, AS A LAWYER, HAVE NO DOUBT 
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CREATION 
OF HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS, 
POSSIBLY MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS 
TO ASK YOU TO RECALL FROM 
MEMORY SOMETHING YOU WROTE 18 
YEARS AGO IS GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT AT ANY MOMENT. 
IN ANY EVENT, THESE E-MAILS 
DEAL WITH AN ISSUE INVOLVING 
SOME QUESTIONS SURROUNDING 
SUPREME COURT CASE CALLED 
ADARAND CON INSTRUCTORS VERSUS 
MANETTA. 
SO LET'S REFER TO A DOCUMENT  
OO289596. 
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOU WERE 
BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE SOME 
ADVICE ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF 
A PARTICULAR ARGUMENT WERE 
PRESENTED TO THE SUPREME COURT 
ON THE MERITS. 
YOU LOOKED AT SOME DEPARTMENT 
OF TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTING 
REGULATIONS. 
AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT, CORRECT 
ME IF I'M WRONG, IF I 
UNDERSTOOD IT CORRECTLY, THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS CONSIDERING 
MAKING A SERIES OF ARGUMENTS 
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND 
YOU DID WHAT A GOOD LAWYER 
SHOULD DO WHEN ADVANCING AN 
ARGUMENT TO THE COURT. 
YOU COUNTED TO FIVE. 
YOU IDENTIFIED FIVE SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES WHO YOU BELIEVED 
WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT THE 
PRECEDENT THAT EXISTED AT THE 
TIME, THE CROSON PRECEDENT WAS 
THE MOST RELEVANT PRECEDENT. 
>> YET AT THE TIME THE SUPREME 
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD 
ALREADY GRANTED REVIEW OF THE 
CASE, MEANING THE SUPREME COURT 
UNLIKE MOST APPELLATE COURTS IS 
IN CHARGE WITH VERY, VERY FEW 
EXCEPTIONS REMAINING TODAY OF 
ITS OWN DOCKETS, IT DECIDES THE 
10,000 OR SO CASES THAT GO TO 
SUPREME COURT EVERY YEAR 
>> I READ YOUR ARGUMENT AS 
SAYING, NUMBER ONE, YOU CANNOT 
COUNT TO FIVE HERE BECAUSE I'M 
IDENTIFYING, I BRETT KAVANAUGH 
HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE 
GREAT DOUBTS AS CHIEF JUSTICE 
RENQUIST, SCALIA, KENNEDY OR 
JUSTICE O'CONNOR CAN EMBRACE 
THESE ARGUMENTS IN DEFENSE OF 
THESE DEPARTMENT OF 
TRANSPORTATION REGULATIONS. 
BUT THE COURT HAS ALREADY 
GRANTED SIRSORI, SO WHAT TO DO? 
AS I UNDERSTAND THE E-MAILS, 
AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, 
YOU RECOMMENDED A COURSE OF 
ACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE 
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE ITS CASE BUT 
TO MAKE ITS INDICATION IN A WAY 
THAT IT WOULD ALLOW THE COURT 
TO DECIDE THAT PERHAPS IT 
SHOULDN'T HAVE GRANTED REVIEW 
IN THE CASE. 
AM I CORRECT SO FAR? 
>> THAT'S CORRECT, SENATOR. 
>> AND WHAT IS THAT CALLED WHEN 
THE COURT DECIDES THAT IT 
SHOULDN'T HAVE GRANTED A CASE? 
>> DISMISSING AS IMPROV 
DENTALLY GRANTED OR OTHER 
COLLOQUIAL KNOWN AS A DIG. 
>> AS A DIG. 
>> YEAH. 
SO YOU CAME UP WITH A STRATEGY 
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENCOURAGING 
THE COURT TO DIG A CASE THAT 
HAD PREVIOUSLY GRANT -- THAT IT 
HAD PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BECAUSE 
YOU BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
GOING TO LOSE AND THE 
REGULATIONS AT ISSUE WERE GOING 
TO BE INVALIDATED AND YOU 
DIDN'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO 
HAVE TO ENDURE THAT. 
DID THEY ACCEPT YOUR ARGUMENTS? 
THE SUPREME COURT DID, YES. 
>> SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THE 
BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THE 
GENERAL'S OFFICE FOLLOWED YOUR 
ADVICE AND WROTE THE ARGUMENTS 
AS YOU HAD PRESCRIBED, THUS 
PROMPTING A DIG. 
AND AS A RESULT THE REGULATIONS 
STOOD, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT, 
SENATOR. 
>> THEY STOOD WHERE THEY 
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE FALLEN 
FALLEN. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
SO HERE AGAIN I HAVE A HARD 
TIME SEEING THIS AS ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN SOMETHING THAT HELPS 
YOU, THAT HELPS YOU NOT JUST 
WITH REPUBLICANS, BUT THAT 
HELPS YOU WITH DEMOCRATS. 
YOU SAW A PROBLEM WITH AN 
ARGUMENT THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
MAKING, YOU IDENTIFIED THAT 
PROBLEM, YOU OFFERED A REMEDY, 
THAT REMEDY WAS EMBRACED BY THE 
SLITTER GENERAL'S OFFICE AND 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND 
THE COURT DID EXACTLY AS YOU 
WANTED IT DO AND AS A RESULT 
THE REGULATION STOOD, THE 
REGULATION THAT SENATOR BOOKER 
IS CONCERNED ABOUT WAS WANTING 
TO MAKE SURE WAS NOT UNDER 
ATTACK UNFAIRLY, WAS IN FACT 
PRESERVED. 
I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING WHY 
THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE HIM WANT TO 
VOTE MORE FOR YOU. 
IN FACT, I THINK SENATOR BOOKER 
REALLY SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU, 
I'LL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION 
WITH HIM LATER. 
>> HI, EVERYOE, I'M REASON 
REASON. 
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE 
CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
WELL, TODAY DEMOCRATS RELEASED 
PREVIOUSLY-CONFIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS RELATED TO 
KAVANAUGH'S VIEWS ON ABORTION 
AND RACIAL PROFILING. 
ONE OF THOSE WAS AN E-MAIL FROM 
2003 FROM KAVANAUGH, AND IT 
APPEARS TO SHOW HIM QUESTIONING 
WHETHER ROE V WADE ACTUALLY IS 
SETTLED LAW. 
AND THAT PUTS HIM AT ODDS WITH 
WHAT HE SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT IN JUST 
A MOMENT. 
BUT, FIRST, WE BEGIN WITH THE 
PRESIDENT SEETHING OVER THE 
PUBLICATION OF A SCATHING 
ANONYMOUS OP-ED IN THE "NEW 
YORK TIMES." 
THE AUTHOR IS SAID TO BE A 
SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION, AND TODAY THE 
HUNT IS ON TO FIND OUT WHO THAT 
PERSON IS. 
AND SINCE THE OP-ED'S RELEASE, 
SEVERAL TOP OFFICIALS OR THEIR 
OFFICES HAVE DENIED BEING ITS 
AUTHOR, INCLUDING THE VICE 
PRESIDENT, THE DIRECTOR OF 
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, DAN 
COATS, THE SECRETARIES OF 
STATE, DEFENSE, HOUSING, 
TREASURY AND HOMELAND SECURITY, 
AND THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE 
U.N. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE 
WAS TRENDING ONLINE YESTERDAY 
BECAUSE IT SAID THAT THE OP-ED 
INCLUDED A WORD THAT HE'S USED 
IN THE PAST. 
THAT WORD LONE STAR. 
WELL, TODAY THE VICE PRESIDENT 
SLAMMED THE AUTHOR AND THE "NEW 
YORK TIMES." 
>> I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE. 
THE ANONYMOUS EDITORIAL 
PUBLISHED IN THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES" REPRESENTS A NEW LOW IN 
AMERICAN JOURNALISM, AND I 
THINK THE "NEW YORK TIMES" 
SHOULD BE ASHAMED, AND I THINK 
WHOEVER WROTE THIS ANONYMOUS 
EDITORIAL SHOULD ALSO BE 
ASHAMED AS WELL. 
>> THE OP-ED QUESTIONS THE 
PRESIDENT'S FITNESS FOR OFFICE. 
THE AUTHOR WRITES THAT 
OFFICIALS ARE, QUOTE, THWARTING 
MR. TRUMP'S MORE MISGUIDED 
POLICIES UNTIL HE IS OUT OF 
OFFICE. 
IN RESPONSE THE PRESIDENT 
CALLED THE OFFICIAL GUTLESS AND 
CALLED FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" 
TO TURN THE PERSON OVER TO THE 
GOVERNMENT. 
LAWMAKERS HAVE REMAINED MOSTLY 
SILENT ON THIS EXPLOSIVE 
RELEASE, AND HERE'S WHAT HOUSE 
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN HAD TO SAY 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT TODAY. 
A PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION SERVES AT THE 
PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT. 
IT'S A PERSON WHO OBVIOUSLY IS 
LIVING IN DISHONESTY. 
IT DOESN'T HELP THE PRESIDENT. 
SO IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN 
HELPING THE PRESIDENT, YOU 
SHOULDN'T WORK FOR THE 
PRESIDENT AS FAR AS I'M 
CONCERNED. 
>> WELL, JOINING ME NOW CBS 
NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT 
PAULA REID WHO JOIN US FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
SO, PAULA, WHAT'S BEEN THE MOOD 
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE SINCE 
THIS OP-ED WAS RELEASED? 
>>REPORTER:  I WOULD DESCRIBE 
IT AS DEFIANT AND A BIT 
PARANOID. 
NOT ONLY IS THE PRESIDENT 
SEETHING OVER THIS OP-ED, HE'S 
ALSO VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS BOOK 
FORTHCOMING FROM BOB WOODWARD. 
THAT BOOK ALLEGES THAT DOZENS 
OF PEOPLE IN HIS OWN 
GOVERNMENT, EVEN IN HIS OWN 
WHITE HOUSE ARE ALLEGING THAT 
HE IS NOT FIT TO SERVE. 
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT IS NEW. 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LEAK, 
ALMOST AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER 
OF LEAKS FROM THIS WHITE HOUSE, 
MANY OF WHICH ARE VERY CRITICAL 
OF THE PRESIDENT. 
BUT HERE IS SEEMS TO HAVE 
REACHED A FEVERED PITCH. 
BUT AS YOU SAW THERE, WHITE 
HOUSE OFFICIALS COMING OUT AND 
SLAMMING NOT ONLY THE ANONYMOUS 
OP-ED, BUT ALSO THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES" FOR PUBLISHING IT. 
>> YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED ABOUT 
THIS, TREASON, CALLING IT DEEP 
STATE AND ALSO CLAIM THAT THE 
SWAMP HE'S TRYING TO DRAIN IS 
FIGHTING BACK. 
ARE THERE ANY CONCRETE ACTIONS 
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE COULD TAKE 
TO COMBAT THIS, AND DO YOU 
THINK THAT THEY COULD 
ULTIMATELY FORCE THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES" TO REVEAL THEIR SOURCE 
HERE? 
>>REPORTER:  I REALLY DON'T 
THINK THEY HAVE ANY GROUND 
LEGALLY SPEAKING TO FORCE THE 
"NEW YORK TIMES" TO REVEAL THE 
IDENTITY OF THIS PERSON. 
THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL LEGAL 
AVENUES WHEN IT COMES TO LEAKS, 
BUT HE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY 
GREAT OPTIONS THERE BECAUSE, 
FIRST OF ALL, HE WOULD NEED TO 
ARGUE THAT THIS FIT UNDER SOME 
SORT OF BROAD NATIONAL SECURITY 
PROTECTION, AND WHILE THE 
DEFINITION UNDER THE LAW FOR 
THAT IS PRETTY BROAD, I THINK 
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE 
THAT CASE HERE. 
NOW, THE OTHER OPTION IS TO ASK 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO 
PURSUE A LEAK INVESTIGATION, 
BUT IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
WAS TO PURSUE A LEAK 
INVESTIGATION, YOU WOULD 
ESSENTIALLY BE ADMITTING THAT 
WHATEVER WAS REVEALED IS TRUE. 
NOW, THE WHITE HOUSE CAN ALSO 
PURSUE ITS OWN LEAK 
INVESTIGATION, BUT, REALLY, 
THERE ARE NO GOOD LEGAL AVENUES 
HERE. 
IT WOULD BE BEST IT SEEMS FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO REALLY FOCUS 
ON A POLITICAL RESPONSE WHICH 
IS WHAT HE IS DOING WHICH IS 
POINTING TO HIS SUPPORTERS AND 
SAYING, LOOK, THIS IS THE DEEP 
STATE, THIS IS THE SORT OF 
SWAMP THAT I AM TRYING TO 
DRAIN. 
AS I DRAIN IT, THEY ARE TRYING 
TO FIGHT BACK. 
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT HE'S 
DOING HERE. 
IN TERMS OF HIS LEGAL OPTIONS, 
THEY REALLY SEEM TO BE THE BEST 
BET IN TERMS OF LEGAL CONTROL. 
>> OMAROSA SAID LOOK AT PAGE 33 
OF MY BOOK. 
THAT MIGHT REVEAL OF WHO THAT 
SOURCE IT. 
INTERNALLY, DO THE WHITE HOUSE 
KNOW WHO THEY BELIEVE WHO IT 
IS. 
>>REPORTER:  THERE'S ONE SOURCE 
WHO SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THE 
PRESIDENT BELIEVES THIS IS 
LIKELY SOMEONE IN NATIONAL 
SECURITY OR IN THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT, AND, REENA, YOU SAW 
THAT GRAPHIC THAT YOU PUT UP, 
THERE IS ONE AGENCY THAT IS 
CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT AND THAT 
IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHICH 
WHICH IS THE TARGET OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S IRE. 
I REACHED OUT TO THEM EARLIER 
TODAY. 
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT 
THEY WILL ISSUE ANY SORT OF 
RESPONSE AS ANY OTHER CABINET 
OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES HAVE 
DONE. 
BUT THAT IS ONE THEORY, WORKING 
THEORY WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> SPEAKING OF D.O.J., I WANT 
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE 
D.O.J. 
I KNOW YOU'VE COVERED THIS 
EXTENSIVELY. 
THEY JUST ANNOUNCED CHARGES 
AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM, 
THIS IS IN CONNECTION TO 
MULTIPLE CYBER ATTACKS, 
PARTIALLY INCLUDING THE 2014 
SONY ATTACK. 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
THIS, PAULA? 
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S RIGHT. 
TODAY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
UNSEALED CHARGES AGAINST A 
NORTH KOREAN HACKER, SOMEONE 
WHO IS WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE 
NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT, AND 
THEY CHARGED HIM IN NUMEROUS 
CYBER ATTACKS, MOST HIGH 
PROFILE WAS OF COURSE THE 2014 
ATTACK ON SONY PICTURES 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
BUT HE WAS ALSO CHARGED FOR 
CREATING THE MALWARE USED IN A 
2017 RANSOMWARE ATTACK AS WELL 
AS A 2016 THEFT OF $81 MILLION 
FROM A BANGLADESH -- EXCUSE ME, 
FROM THE BANK OF BANGLADESH. 
NOW, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME 
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS 
FILED CHARGES AGAINST SOMEONE 
HACKING ON BEHALF OF AN 
ADVERSARIAL NATION. 
THEY'VE DONE THIS WITH RUSSIA, 
WITH CHINA, WITH IRAN AND NOW 
NORTH KOREA. 
BUT, REENA, ONE OF THE 
COMPLICATION OF TAKING THIS 
APPROACH IS WE DON'T HAVE AN 
EXTRADITION TREATY WITH ANY OF 
 
SO USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS 
THESE CHARGES ARE ANNOUNCED 
WITH GREAT FANFARE, BUT NO ONE 
IS EVER ACTUALLY ARRESTED, NOR 
DO THEY EVER SEE THE INSIDE OF 
A U.S. COURTROOM. 
SO SOME FOLKS HAVE QUESTION 
WHETHER OR NOT THIS REALLY HAS 
ANY SORT OF DETERRENT IMPACT. 
>> I GET THE DETERRENT ASPECT. 
I'M CURIOUS, PAULA, WHEN THE 
D.O.J. 
MAKES AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE 
CHARGES LIKE THIS, IS IT IN 
COORDINATION WITH THE WHITE 
HOUSE? 
IT'S SLIGHTLY STRANGE. 
IT COMES ON THE SAME DAY THAT 
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED HIS 
THANKS TO JONG. 
SO WHY DO YOU THANK SOMEBODY 
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO 
PRESS CHARGESES AGAINST THEM? 
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S RIGHT. 
IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 
WHITE HOUSE ARE COMPLETELY ON 
THE SAME PAGE HERE. 
USUALLY WHEN THERE'S ANY OTHER 
SORT OF NATIONAL SECURITY CASE 
FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 
THERE IS COORDINATION WITH THE 
WHITE HOUSE, WITH THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY COUNCIL, WITH THEIR 
COMPONENTS. 
HERE WE ARE ASK -- WE WERE 
ASKED AT A BRIEFING EARLIER 
TODAY IF THERE WAS ANY SORT OF 
INER-AGENCY COORDINATION ON 
THIS, AND THEY SAID, YES, THERE 
WAS SOME, BUT THEY WOULD NOT 
SPECIFY WHO THEY SPOKE WITH, 
WHAT KIND OF COORDINATION THERE 
IS WA AND WHETHER THE PRESIDENT 
WAS NOTIFIED. 
IT IS ALSO NOTABLE THAT THESE 
CHARGES WERE ACTUALLY 
ORIGINALLY FILED BACK IN MAY. 
THEY WERE JUST MADE PUBLIC 
TODAY. 
AND OF COURSE WHEN THESE WERE 
ORIGINALLY FILED, THIS WOULD 
HAVE BEEN AROUND THE SAME TIME 
AS THE NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 
JONG-UN. 
SO THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE WERE 
WITHHELD SO AS NOT TO 
COMPLICATE THAT SUMMIT ANY 
FURTHER AND WHY THEY WERE 
RELEASED TODAY. 
BUT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS 
NOT ABLE TO GIVE US AN ANSWER 
ABOUT WHY THESE CHARGES WERE 
MADE PUBLIC TODAY. 
>> YOU KNOW, PAULA, I GOT A 
FORTUNE COOKIE ON SATURDAY THAT 
SAID MAY YOU LIVE IN 
INTERESTING TIMES. 
I GUESS THAT FORTUNE APPLIES TO 
ALL OF US. 
>>REPORTER:  I THINK IT 
ABSOLUTELY DOES. 
AND IT PROBABLY WILL FOR THE 
FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
ALL RIGHT, PAULA, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
LOTS OF TWISTS AND TURNS. 
PAULA REID COMING TO US FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>>>  WELL, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
SECOND SUPREME COURT NOMINEE IS 
BACK ON CAPITOL HILL FOR HIS 
THIRD DAY. 
THURSDAY'S CONFIRMATION HEARING 
GREW CONTENTIOUS EARLIER. 
DID YOU SEE THIS? 
IT WAS NEW JERSEY SENATE 
DEMOCRAT CORY BOOKER. 
HE RELEASED A BATCH OF 
DOCUMENTS THAT WERE MARKED 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL, MEANING 
THAT THEY WERE MEANT ONLY FOR 
THE EYES OF THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, NO ONE 
ELSE. 
AND AS BOOKER EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED 
HIMSELF, HIS ACTIONS COULD 
ACTUALLY GET HIM KICKED OUT OF 
THE SENATE. 
>> I AM RIGHT NOW BEFORE YOUR 
-- BEFORE YOUR PROCESS IS 
FINISHED, I'M GOING TO TO 
RELEASE THE E-MAIL ABOUT RACIAL 
PROFILING, AND I UNDERSTAND 
THAT THAT -- THE PENALTY COMES 
WITH POTENTIAL OUSTING FROM THE 
SENATE. 
AND IF SENATOR CORNYN BELIEVES 
THAT I HAVE VIOLATED SENATE 
RULES, I OPENLY INVITE AND 
ACCEPT THE KONS QUADRICEPSES OF 
MY TEAM -- CONSEQUENCES OF MY 
TEAM RELEASING THAT E-MAIL 
RIGHT NOW. 
I'M RELEASING IT TO EXPOSE, 
NUMBER ONE, THAT E-MAILS ARE 
BEING WITHHELD FROM THE PUBLIC, 
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 
NATIONAL SECURITY, NOTHING TO 
JEOPARDIZE THE SANG AT THIS 
TIME OF THOSE IDEALS THAT I -- 
SANK AT THIS TIME OF THOSE 
IDEALS THAT I HOLD DEAR. 
INSTEAD, WHAT I'M RELEASING 
THIS DOCUMENT RIGHT NOW TO 
SHOW, SIR, IS THAT WE HAVE A 
PROCESS HERE FOR A PERSON, THE 
HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND FOR 
A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. 
WE'RE RUSHING THROUGH THIS 
BEFORE ME AND MY COLLEAGUES CAN 
EVEN READ AND DIGEST THE 
INFORMATION. 
>> RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS NO 
EXCUSE FOR VIOLATING THE RULES 
OF THE SENATE OR OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE 
DOCUMENTS THAT WE ARE PRIVY TO. 
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE 
SENATOR DECIDING TO RELEASE 
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION THAT IS 
DEEMED CLASSIFIED BY THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH BECAUSE YOU 
HAPPEN TO DISAGREE WITH THE 
CLASSIFICATION DECISION. 
>> WELL, SHORTLY AFTER THAT, 
HAWAII DEMOCRAT MAZIE HERONO 
ALSO RELEASED COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS TOO. 
AND SHE SAYS THE DOCUMENTS SHOW 
THAT KAVANAUGH BELIEVES THAT 
PROGRAMS FOR NATIVE HAWAIIANS 
ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY 
QUESTIONABLE. 
FOR MORE ON THE HEARINGS, I 
WANT TO BRING IN SCOTT LONG, 
HE'S A SENIOR REPORTER FOR THE 
HILL. 
SO, SCOTT, WHAT EXACTLY WAS IN 
THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT SENATOR 
BOOKER RELEASED? 
>> WELL, THERE WERE SEVERAL 
DOCUMENTS. 
I THINK THE ONE THAT HE WAS 
REFERRING TO IN YOUR CLIP HAD 
TO DO WITH DISCUSSIONS IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE THAT WERE TAKING 
PLACE RIGHT AFTER 9/11 IN 2002. 
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT 
HOW CERTAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PROGRAMS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED, 
HOW T.S.A. 
SHOULD HANDLE SECURITY MEASURES 
FOR AIRPORTS, THE T.S.A. 
AGENCY THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED 
AT THAT TIME. 
AND SO THESE WERE ARGUMENTS, 
DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE TAKING 
PLACE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
CORY BOOKER BELIEVES THAT, YOU 
KNOW, IT REVEALED OR SHOWED 
SOME OF KAVANAUGH'S 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MUSLIMS 
PERHAPS, BUT, YOU KNOW, 
KAVANAUGH IS DENYING THAT, AND, 
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY INTERESTING 
NOW. 
WE ARE SEEING SENATORS SORT OF 
RACING TO RELEASE DOCUMENTS IN 
THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. 
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, SCOTT, THE 
PUNISHMENT HERE FOR RELEASING 
THESE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS COULD BE AS SERIOUS 
AS BEING KICKED OUT OF THE 
SENATE. 
HOW LIKELY DO YOU THINK THAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN, ESPECIALLY 
WITH BOOKER AND HERONO 
RELEASING THESE DOCUMENTS? 
>> I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY 
THAT REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES 
WOULD MOVE TO EXPEL A MEMBER OF 
THE SENATE IN THIS CASE. 
IT IS SORT OF UNPRECEDENTED 
THAT WE WOULD SEE DEMOCRATS, 
YOU KNOW, COMPETING WITH ONE 
ANOTHER TO RELEASE THESE 
DOCUMENTS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
HAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL. 
HOWEVER, INFORM THE COMMENTS OF 
DICK DURBIN, ONE OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WHO ALSO 
SERVES ON THE JUDICIARY, HE 
SAID THAT HE STANDS WITH CORY 
BOOKER, HE ASSOCIATES HIMSELF 
WITH CORY BOOKER'S ACTIONS, AND 
THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE TO 
RETALIATE AGAINST CORY BOOKER, 
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE 
AGAINST ALMOST ALL DEMOCRATS 
AND REPUBLICANS I THINK ARE 
UNWILLING TO DO SO. 
>> I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
ANOTHER EXCHANGE. 
THIS ONE WAS FROM LAST NIGHT 
AND IT WAS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA 
DEMOCRAT KAMALA HARRIS AND 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
>> HAVE YOU DISCUSSED MUELLER 
OR HIS INVESTIGATION WITH 
ANYONE AT CASSOWITS, BENSON AND 
TORRES, THE LAW FIRM FOUNDED BY 
MARK CASSOWITS, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S PERSONAL LAWYER? 
BE SURE ABOUT YOUR ANSWER, SIR. 
>> WELL, I'M NOT REMEMBERING. 
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU 
WANT TO -- 
>> ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU HAVE NOT 
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE 
AT THAT LAW FIRM? 
WHO DID YOU TALK TO? 
>> I DON'T THINK -- I'M NOT 
REMEMBERING. 
BUT I'M HAPPY TO BE REFRESHED 
OR IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHO 
YOU'RE THINKING -- 
>> SIR, ARE YOU SAYING THAT 
WITH ALL YOU REMEMBER YOU HAVE 
-- YOU HAVE AN IMPECCABLE 
MEMORY, YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING 
EIGHT HOURS OR MORE WITH THIS 
COMMITTEE ABOUT ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS YOU REMEMBER. 
HOW CAN YOU NOT REMEMBER 
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD A 
CONVERSATION ABOUT ROBERT 
MUELLER OR HIS INVESTIGATION 
WITH ANYONE AT THAT LAW FIRM. 
THIS INVESTIGATION HAS ONLY 
BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG, SIR. 
SO PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK DO 
I KNOW ANYONE WHO WORKS AT THAT 
FIRM. 
I MIGHT KNOW -- I WOULD LIKE TO 
KNOW THE PERSON YOU'RE THINKING 
OF BECAUSE WHAT IF THERE'S -- 
>> I THINK YOU'RE THINKING OF 
SOMEONE YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL 
US. 
>> WELL, THAT EXCHANGE WAS 
ACTUALLY INTRUMENTED LATER BY 
REPUBLICAN MIKE LEE. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS SAYS -- 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS 
HER PUSHING FOR THIS. 
THIS IS ACTUALLY TRUMP'S 
LAWYER'S LAW FIRM. 
WHY DO YOU THINK HE SO 
PAINSTAKINGLY AVOIDED THAT 
QUESTION? 
>> WELL, I THINK THESE ARE 
QUESTIONS THAT COULD COME 
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IN 
FUTURE MONTHS, ESPECIALLY ONCE 
WE KNOW THE RESULTS OF THE 
ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION 
SPECIFICALLY, WHETHER TRUMP CAN 
INTERVENE AND STOP THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION, WHETHER HE CAN 
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER HIMSELF OR 
MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM, AND SO IF 
KAVANAUGH IS SERVING ON A 
SUPREME COURT THAT IS DECIDING 
THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES, I THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW, 
WHETHER WE KNOW WHETHER HE HAS 
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF 
TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS WHO ARE 
SPECIFICALLY BROUGHT ON TO DEAL 
WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. 
>> AND, YOU KNOW, KAVANAUGH AT 
THIS POINT, SCOTT, IS THERE 
ANYTHING THAT WOULD INDICATE TO 
YOU THAT HIS NOMINATION, 
CHANCESES OF BEING CONFIRMED 
ARE ACTUALLY -- CHANCES OF 
BEING CONFIRMED ARE ACTUALLY AT 
THIS POINT? 
>> I DON'T THINK SO. 
WE SAW THE SWEARING IN OF 
FORMER ARIZONA SENATOR JON KYL 
YESTERDAY WHO REPLACED McCAIN 
IN THE SENATE. 
THEY ARE BACK AT 51 SEATS. 
IT IS A NARROW MAJORITY, BUT IT 
IS A MAJORITY. 
AND WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY 
VOTE, THEY CAN CONFIRM 
KAVANAUGH, ESPECIALLY WITH 
PERHAPS SOME HELP FROM THE VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
AND WE ARE EXPECTING SOME 
DEMOCRATS TO PERHAPS COME 
ACROSS THE AISLE AND PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL VOTES. 
SO RIGHT NOW AS I SEE IT THERE 
HAS NOT BEEN ANY SORT OF 
KNOCKOUT BLOW. 
CERTAINLY THESE NEW E-MAIL 
RELEASES HAVE RAISED SOME 
QUESTIONS. 
BUT SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS 
ON HIS WAY TO CONFIRMATION. 
>> ALL RIGHT, SCOTT, BEFORE WE 
GO, I WANT TO ASK YOU ALSO 
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT KIND OF 
CAUGHT OUR EYE THAT CAME DOWN 
TODAY. 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS 
TO CHANGE A RULE THAT WOULD 
ACTUALLY ALLOW UNDOCUMENTED 
CHILDREN TO BE DETAINED 
INDEFINITELY. 
THIS ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE PENDING 
AN IMMIGRATION COURT CASE. 
PREVIOUSLY THEY HAD TO RELEASE 
THESE KIDS WITHIN 20 DAYS. 
WHAT IS THIS -- DO YOU BELIEVE 
THIS HAS TRACTION, AND WHAT 
DOES IT MEAN FOR THE FAMILIES 
WHO HAVE CHILDREN IN U.S. 
DETENTIONS? 
>> WELL, IF THIS RULE IS 
IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF THE 
YEAR, IT WILL MEAN THAT PEOPLE 
THAT COME ACROSS THE BORDER AND 
BRING THEIR CHILDREN WITH NOW 
BE DETAINED INDEFINITELY 
TOGETHER RATHER THAN SEPARATING 
KIDS AND PARENTS, BUT THAT 
INDEFINITE DETENTION IS SORT OF 
THE KEY. 
IT WOULD LAST UNTIL A COURT 
CASE IS RESOLVED, UNTIL THEY 
ARE EITHER DEPORTED OR GRANTED 
ACCESS TO THE UNITED STATES. 
IT THROWS THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE 
RIGHT FRONT AND CENTER RIGHT 
BEFORE THE NOVEMBER MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHY THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND WHY 
THE PRESIDENT PUSHED SO 
AGGRESSIVELY TO GET THIS RULE 
COMPLETED. 
AND SO ONCE AGAIN, AN ISSUE 
THAT WE THOUGHT WAS SORT OF ON 
THE BACK BURNER, IMMIGRATION 
AND CHILD DETENTIONS IS FRONT 
AND CENTER ONCE AGAIN. 
>> AND, SCOTT, YOU KNOW, 
THERE'S ROUGHLY -- LAST 
ESTIMATE WE HAD WHICH WAS FROM 
A FEW WEEKS AGO FROM D.H.S. 
THAT THERE ARE ROUGHLY 500 KIDS 
WHO STILL REMAIN SEPARATED FROM 
THEIR PARENTS. 
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE KIDS? 
DO WE KNOW? 
>> WELL, I THINK D.H.S. 
IS IN A LOT OF THOSE CASES HAS 
STRUGGLED TO REUNITE THOSE 
CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS, 
EITHER BECAUSE THEY CAN'T 
LOCATE THEM OR BECAUSE THOSE 
PARENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
DEPORTED BACK TO THEIR OWN 
COUNTRIES. 
IT'S REALLY AN INDIVIDUAL 
BASIS. 
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IN THESE VERY 
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THESE 500 
KIDS. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
SCOTT WONG, GRATEFUL YOU COULD 
JOIN US FROM THE HILL. 
SCOTT, THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>>  WELL ARE, NOW I WANT TO 
GET TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS 
FROM NORTH KOREA. 
KIM JONG-UN SAYS HE IS 
COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION 
BY THE END OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
FIRST TERM. 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH 
KOREAN GOVERNMENT. 
A DELEGATION FROM SEOUL MET 
WITH KIM ON WEDNESDAY AND 
DELIVERED A PRIVATE MESSAGE. 
THE MESSAGE WAS FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
AND NOW SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS 
SAY THAT THE NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER ALSO PRAISED MR. TRUMP 
AND EXPRESSED FULL CONFIDENCE 
IN HIM. 
WELL, THE PRESIDENT SHARED HIS 
GRATITUDE THIS MORNING ON 
TWITTER, WRITING, QUOTE, KIM 
JONG-UN OF NORTH KOREA 
PROCLAIMS UNWAVERING FAITH IN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN KIM. 
WE WILL GET IT DONE TOGETHER. 
FOR MORE ON THIS WE'RE JOINED 
BY ISAAC STONE FISH, A CBSN 
CONTRIBUTOR AND A SENIOR FELLOW 
AT THE ASIAN SOCIETY CENTER ON 
U.S./CHINA RELATIONS. 
THE THING ABOUT THIS STORY, 
ISAAC, IT'S ALWAYS STOOD OUT TO 
ME, SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
WORKED ON THIS, PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS, THE KOREA 
TALKS WERE SO OPTIMISTIC AND 
ACTUALLY GAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THE UPPER HAND WHICH PEOPLE 
TYPICALLY HAVEN'T ON FOREIGN 
POLICY HERE. 
THESE CLAIMS OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION THAT KIM HAS 
MADE, DO YOU BUY THEM? 
DOES THE ADMINISTRATION STILL 
BUY THEM? 
>> I PERSONALLY DON'T BUY THEM. 
I THINK POSSIBLY KIM JONG-UN IS 
SAYING, OKAY, WE WILL GET RID 
OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHEN THE 
UNITED STATES RELEASES ITS 
NUCLEAR UMBRELLA OVER SOUTH 
KOREA WHEN IT MOVES A LOT OF 
THE TROOPS OR ALL OF THE 
TROOPS, ALL OF THE ROUGHLY 
28,500 TROOPS THAT AMERICA HAS 
ON THE SOUTH KOREAN PENINSULA 
AND IF IT SIGNS A PEACE TREATY 
THAT WOULD OFFICIALLY END THE 
1950, 1953 KOREAN WAR. 
I THINK IT'S A SURPRISING MOVE 
BY KIM JONG-UN, AND IT'S 
CERTAINLY THROWING TRUMP A LIFE 
LINE WHEN HE CERTAINLY NEEDS 
ONE. 
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S 
ACTUALLY GOING TO LEAD TO NORTH 
KOREAN DENUCLEARIZATION. 
>> YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
ALWAYS SO QUICK TO PRAISE THE 
NORTH KOREAN LEADER. 
HOW DOES THAT IMPACT 
NEGOTIATIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH 
DIPLOMATS? 
>> IT'S BEEN SUCH A SHOCKING 
DAY, SHOCKING WEEK. 
I MEAN, DEEP STATE, FAKE NEWS, 
TRUMP HAS THIS FEELING OF BEING 
VERY, VERY BELEAGUERED AND 
PARANOID, AND WHO DOES HE TURN 
TO TO PRAISE? 
KIM JONG-UN. 
>> YEAH. 
>> I THINK KIM PLAYED A VERY 
SUCCESSFUL DIPLOMATIC MANEUVER 
BY PRAISING TRUMP AND SAYING 
HOW TRUSTWORTHY HE THOUGHT 
TRUMP WAS AT THIS TIME WHEN 
TRUMP HIMSELF IS PROBABLY 
FEELING INCREDIBLY PARANOID AND 
DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE CAN TRUST. 
AND NOW WE'RE AT THIS VERY 
BIZARRE SPECTACLE WHERE IT 
SEEMS LIKE KIM JONG-UN IS 
SOMEONE TRUMP THINKS HE CAN 
TRUST. 
>> SO THE DELEGATION FROM SOUTH 
KOREA MET WITH KIM YESTERDAY, A 
SPECIAL LETTER WAS DELIVERED 
FROM THE PRESIDENT. 
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
CONTENT? 
>> WE DON'T. 
WE KNOW THAT THE TWO SIDES ARE 
-- EXCHANGED LETTER, AND WE DO 
KNOW THAT THIS WAS A VISIT TO 
SET UP THE SOUTH KOREAN 
PRESIDENT'S FIRST TRIP TO 
PYONGYANG, SEPTEMBER 18th, 
SEPTEMBER 20th. 
WE DON'T KNOW YET IF THIS HAS 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF KIM JONG-UN 
COMING TO NEW YORK FOR THE 
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
AT THE END OF THE MONTH. 
THERE'S A LOT OF RUMORS ABOUT 
THAT. 
EARLIER IN THE SUMMER, 
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SUMMIT, 
THOSE HAVE DIED DOWN SINCE ALL 
OF THE TENSIONS THAT HAVE SORT 
OF FLARED UP AGAIN AFTER THE 
SUMMIT, BUT WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT 
EXACTLY THE TWO SIDES WERE 
SAYING. 
>> DO YOU SEE REALISTICALLY 
BECAUSE EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT 
MOON CAME INTO OFFICE, HE HAD 
SAID HE REALLY WANTS TO IRON 
OUT SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH 
NORTH KOREA, MAKE THIS WORK. 
COULD YOU SEE A SITUATION WHERE 
THE TWO KOREAS WORK THIS OUT 
TOGETHER WITHOUT THE U.S., OR 
DOES THE U.S. NEED TO BE THERE? 
>> I THINK THE U.S. REALLY 
NEEDS TO BE THERE. 
AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS 
THAT NORTH KOREA IS HAVING THIS 
WITH SOUTH KOREA IS BECAUSE IT 
IS AFRAID OF CHINA, IT'S AFRAID 
OF OVERWHELMING CHINESE 
INFLUENCE. 
ROUGHLY 90% OF NORTH KOREA'S 
TRADE GOES THROUGH CHINA, AND I 
THINK NORTH KOREA REALLY 
REALIZES THE DANGERS OF BEING 
OVERLY RELIANT ON THAT ONE 
NATION. 
SO THEY'RE LOOKING TO SOUTH 
KOREA. 
THEY'RE IN A SMALLER WAY 
LOOKING TO JAPAN AND RUSSIA, 
AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE 
UNITED STATES, BECAUSE IF NORTH 
KOREA JUST HAS IMPROVED 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOUTH KOREA, 
IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ENOUGH TO 
PROTECT IT FROM OVERWHELMING 
CHINESE INFLUENCE. 
>> AND IF TALKS WITH NORTH 
KOREA COMPLETELY DERAIL, DO YOU 
GET A SENSE FROM THE 
ADMINISTRATION THERE'S A PLAN 
B? 
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A 
PLAN A. 
>> WELL SAID. 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH 
THAT STATEMENT. 
SO, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT 
THEY ARE PUSHING RIGHT NOW, 
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY 
PUSHING TO SORT OF GET SOME 
SORT OF TALKS WITH THEM, POMPEO 
HAS HAD EARNEST ATTEMPTS TO TRY 
TO MAKE THIS WORK. 
HE'S THE AMERICAN OFFICIAL 
THAT'S SPENT THE MOST TIME WITH 
KIM JONG-UN AT THIS POINT. 
IF THESE TALKS DO FAIL, IS 
ANYBODY AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT, ANY FOLKS YOU'RE 
TALKING TO HAVE ANY SENSE THAT 
THERE IS ANOTHER PATH FORWARD 
IN DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA? 
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE 
SPOKEN TO AND THE GENERAL 
CONSENSUS IN D.C. IS LET'S HOPE 
IT DOESN'T REVERT TO WHERE IT 
WAS A YEAR AGO WHEN KIM JONG-UN 
WAS CALLING TRUMP A DOTARRED 
AND TRUMP WAS PROMISING FIRE 
AND FURY, LIKE THE WORLD HAS 
NEVER SEEN. 
SO NOT TO BE TOO HARSH ON THE 
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I DO 
THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE 
PRESIDENT WHO REALIZED THAT 
GOING TO WAR WITH NORTH KOREA 
WOULD BE A DISASTROUS THING, 
AND I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE WORKING TO PREVENT 
THAT. 
>> ISAAC STONE FISH, THANKS FOR 
JOINING US. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>>  WELL, STILL AHEAD A DEADLY 
WAVE OF VIOLENCE IN AFGHANISTAN 
THIS WEEK LEAVES DOZENS DEAD 
AND THE TALIBAN AND ISIS ARE 
LIKELY BEHIND THE ATTACKS. 
>>>  PLUS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
BATTLING ANOTHER WILDFIRE 
TODAY. 
THIS ONE IS DESCRIBED AS 
EXTREME AND IT'S FORCED A MAJOR 
INTERSTATE TO CLOSE. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>>  AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE ARE 
DEAD IN CINCINNATI FOLLOWING A 
SHOOTING AND IT INCLUDES THE 
GUNMAN WHO WAS KILLED AFTER 
EXCHANGING FIRE WITH POLICE. 
THE SHOOTER OPENED FIRE IN THE 
LOBBY OF A DOWNTOWN OFFICE 
BUILDING THIS MORNING. 
AND AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NO 
KNOWN MOTIVE FOR THE SHOOTING. 
THE F.B.I. 
AND THE A.T.F. 
RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND ARE 
ASSISTING CINCINNATI POLICE IN 
THEIR INVESTIGATION. 
>>> AN UPDATE NOW ON A 
NATIONWIDE SEXUAL ABUSE 
ALLEGATIONS IN THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH. 
WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE NEW YORK 
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SUBPOENAED 
ALL ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESE IN 
NEW YORK, AND AN INVESTIGATION 
WILL LOOK INTO POTENTIAL 
COVERUP ALLEGATIONS. 
THIS ACTUALLY FOLLOWS SIMILAR 
PROBES IN MISSOURI AND 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
LAST MONTH A GRAND JURY IN 
PENNSYLVANIA REVEALED THAT MORE 
THAN 300 CLERGY MEMBERS ABUSED 
MORE THAN 1,000 VICTIMS OVER 
DECADES. 
>>> A NEW WAVE OF VIOLENCE HAS 
LEFT MULTIPLE POLICE OFFICERS 
DEAD IN AFGHANISTAN. 
AUTHORITIES SAY THAT A FELLOW 
-- A FORMER FELLOW OFFICER 
CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK AFTER HE 
JOINED THE TALIBAN. 
THIS COMES ONE DAY AFTER A 
SUICIDE BOMBER ATTACKED A 
SPORTS CLUB IN KABUL. 
LATER THAT DAY A SECOND BLAST 
HIT EMERGENCY SERVICES AND 
JOURNALISTS ARRIVING ON THE 
SCENE. 
AT LEAST 23 PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
IN THAT ATTACK. 
ISIS HAS CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
>>>  A POWERFUL HURRICANE IN 
THE ATLANTIC MAY BE A THREAT TO 
THE EAST COAST IN THE COMING 
DAYS. 
IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL 
FOR SURE, THOUGH. 
HURRICANE FLORENCE IS THE FIRST 
MAJOR HURRICANE ON THE 2018 
ATLANTIC SEASON. 
FORECASTERSAREN'T SURE OF ITS 
PATH, BUT THEY DO PREDICT THAT 
BERMUDA WILL ACTUALLY BEGIN TO 
FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE STORM 
AS EARLY AS TOMORROW. 
ANY THREAT TO THE EAST COAST 
WILL BECOME MORE CLEAR IN THE 
COMING DAYS. 
>>>  FIREFIGHTERS ARE BATTLING 
AN EXPLOSIVE WILDFIRE IN 
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
THE DELTA FIRE STARTED BURNING 
ALONG INTERSTATE 5 ON WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND HAS SINCE TRIPLED 
IN SIZE. 
TRUCKERS WERE FORCED TO ABANDON 
THEIR VEHICLES IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE FREEWAY. 
AT LEAST FOUR BIG RIGS BECAME 
ENGULFED IN FLAMES. 
FIRE OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT THE 
FIRE WAS CAUSED BY HUMANS. 
UNCLEAR, THOUGH, WHETHER IT WAS 
ACCIDENTAL OR ARSON. 
>>>  COMING UP AFTER A BREAK, 
TWITTER AND FACEBOOK EXECUTIVES 
ADMIT THAT THEY WERE NOT 
EQUIPPED TO STOP MISINFORMATION 
IN 2016, BUT ARE THEY PREPARED 
FOR THIS YEAR'S MIDTERMS? 
>>>  PLUS COULD THIS ONGOING 
EXECUTIVE CHALLENGE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IN 2020? 
HOWARD SCHULTZ DISCUSSES 
POTENTIAL POLITICAL PLANS AFTER 
LIFE POST-STARBUCKS. 
THIS IS CBSN, ALWAYS ON. 
>>>  IN LOCAL MATTERS, VOTERS 
IN DELAWARE ARE HEADING TO THE 
POLLS TODAY TO DECIDE THE FATE 
OF ONE INCUMBENT LAWMAKER WHO 
HASN'T FACED A PRIMARY 
CHALLENGER IN NEARLY TWO 
DECADES SERVING AS SENATOR. 
FIRST-TIME PROGRESSIVE 
CANDIDATE KERRY EVELYN HARRIS 
WILL FACE OFF AGAINST THREE-
TERM DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TOM 
CARPER. 
HE ALSO SERVED AS THE STATE'S 
GOVERNOR FOR EIGHT YEARS AND 
ALSO SERVED IN THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES. 
IF HARRIS WINS THE NOMINATION, 
SHE COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE 
FIRST OPENLY LBGTQ PERSON OF 
COLOR TO SERVE IN THE U.S. 
SENATE. 
FOR MORE ON THIS CLOSELY 
WATCHED RACE, I'M JOINED BY 
NANCY, SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF 
THE CENTER FOR POLITICAL 
COMMUNICATIONS AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE, AND SHE 
JOINS ME NOW FROM NEWARK. 
SO I WANT TO START HERE WITH 
THIS DEMOCRATIC SENATE PRIMARY. 
KERRY HARRIS ENDORSED BY BOTH 
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS AND OF 
COURSE INCOMING ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO CORTEZ FROM THE HOUSE. 
SHE'S FACING OFF AGAINST A 
CANDIDATE WHO'S ACTUALLY BEEN 
IN THE POLITICAL ARENA FOR MORE 
THAN 40 YEARS. 
SO GIVEN HOW THIS PRIMARY 
SEASON HAS GONE DOWN, HOW 
LIKELY IS SHE TO SNAG THIS 
SEAT? 
>> OH, I'M NOT WILLING TO EVEN 
PREDICT THAT BECAUSE IT'S A 
VERY UNPREDICTABLE DAY FOR A 
PRIMARY IN DELAWARE. 
WE'VE NEVER HAD A THURSDAY 
PRIMARY BEFORE. 
IT'S ALSO TRIPLE-DIGIT HEAT 
INDEX OUT THERE, AND I'VE HEARD 
FROM PEOPLE THAT IT'S SLOW AT 
THE POLLS. 
SO IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO 
THE TURNOUT. 
WHETHER THAT TURNOUT IS FOR HER 
OR SENATOR CARPER, THAT'S HOW 
IT'S GOING TO TIP. 
NOBODY EXPECTED MIKE CASSEL TO 
BE VOTED OUT IN 2010 IN A 
PRIMARY. 
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW 
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND 
WONDERING WHAT VERY WELL COULD 
HAPPEN TODAY IN DELAWARE. 
>> NANCY, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING 
POLITICS FOR SOME TIME. 
ARE YOU SURPRISED ABOUT HOW 
WE'RE SEEING -- I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THE POLITICAL TERM WOULD 
BE IF IT IS ACTUALLY A WAVE OR 
NOT, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY 
SURPRISES THAT HAVE COME IN 
PRIMARIES THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
THIS SEASON. 
ARE YOU SURPRISED AS SOMEONE 
WHO'S WATCHED THIS? 
>> I AM SURPRISED. 
IN SOME WAYS I FEEL THERE'S 
ALWAYS A PENDULUMSWINGING AND 
I THINK IN 2016 IT SWING, AND 
IT HAS JUST TAKEN THAT MOMENTUM 
AND SWUNG OVER, AND I FEEL THAT 
WE'RE ALL KIND OF ON A RIDE 
RIGHT NOW, JUST WAITING TO SEE 
WHERE OUR POLITICAL CULTURE AND 
OUR SOCIETY IS GOING TO SHAKE 
OUT. 
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO 
GET BACK TO THE MIDDLE, I DON'T 
THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET 
FURTHER RIGHT OR FURTHER LEFT. 
I HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE IT IS SO 
UNPREDICTABLE, ESPECIALLY WITH 
AN ELECTORATE THAT'S JUST SO 
ANGRY AND FRUSTRATING BY WHAT 
THEY SEE IS NOT HAPPENING 
EITHER FOR THEM OR FOR THEIR 
STATE. 
>> AND, YOU KNOW, JUST LAST 
NIGHT FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE 
BIDEN ISSUED A ROBO CALL 
ENDORSING SENATOR CARPER. 
IS THAT UNUSUAL? 
>> IT IS UNUSUAL FOR SENATOR 
BIDEN TO BE INVOLVED IN 
ELECTIONS EVER SINCE HE WENT TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR 
THE VICE PRESIDENT TO BE 
INVOLVED WITH TOM CARPER. 
THEY WORKED VERY CLOSELY ON THE 
HILL FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHEN 
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS A 
SENATOR AND THE SENATOR WAS A 
CONGRESSMAN, THAT'S THE 
DELAWARE WAY, AND THEY HAVE 
WORKED TOGETHER ON MANY ISSUES 
FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR THE 
STATE. 
SO I WASN'T SURPRISED BY IT. 
PERHAPS MORE OF, YOU KNOW, 
ACTUAL PHYSICAL APPEARANCES ON 
BEHALF OF THE DEMOCRAT 
INCUMBENT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE 
TOTALLY SHOCKED ME. 
>> SO CARPER IS ACTUALLY THE 
ONLY REMAINING DEMOCRAT IN THE 
SENATE WHO VOTED TO CONFIRM 
BRETT KAVANAUGH WHEN HE WAS UP 
FOR CONFIRMATION BACK IN 2006 
FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT. 
IS THAT SORT OF DECISION, THAT 
VOTE PLAYING OUT IN THIS RACE 
AT ALL? 
>> VERY LITTLE. 
I THINK THAT IT WAS IN THE 
BEGINNING, BUT THE SENATOR SHOT 
IT DOWN, AND KERRY HARRIS HAS 
MOVED ON TO OTHER WAYS TO, YOU 
KNOW, PINPOINT THINGS WITHIN 
THE RECORD THAT SHE COULD DRAW 
ATTENTION TO, MOSTLY THE FACT 
THAT SHE'S GOING FOR THE FACT 
THAT SHE'S A NEWCOMER, AN 
OUTSIDER AND HE IS A PART OF 
THE OLD GUARD. 
IT'S SORT OF THE OLD AGE ISSUE 
BUT WITH NEW DEFINITIONS. 
>> INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SAY 
THAT. 
YOU KNOW, NANCY, WALK US 
THROUGH THIS, THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE OF THIS RACE, WHAT CAN WE 
EXPECT AND WHO ARE YOU 
WATCHING? 
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY 
INTERESTING. 
THERE ARE TWO CANDIDATES ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 
DELAWARE REPUBLICANS HAVE ONLY 
TWO STATEWIDE OFFICES. 
IT'S ALL DEMOCRAT HERE. 
SO THE FACT THAT THERE COULD BE 
AN UPSET ON THIS -- ON THE 
DEMOCRAT SIDE WITH THE 
INCUMBENT, IF YOU LOOK TOWARD 
THE REPUBLICAN, YOU HAVE A 
SUSSEX COUNTY WHICH IS THE 
LOWER COUNTY IN DELAWARE ALONG 
THE BEACHES. 
YOU HAVE A COUNTY COUNCILMAN OR 
A CITY COUNCILMAN THERE WHO 
ACTUALLY STUMPED FOR TRUMP TWO 
YEARS AGO AND COORDINATED PART 
OF THAT CAMPAIGN. 
AND THEN YOU HAVE A NORTHERN 
DELAWARE CANDIDATE WHO ALSO IS 
AN LBGTQ CANDIDATE, OPENLY-
DECLARED CANDIDATE. 
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD 
POSSIBLY HAPPEN HERE FOR A 
STATE THAT USUALLY HASN'T BEEN 
PROGRESSIVE. 
THIS COULD BE, YOU KNOW, A VERY 
INTERESTING TURN OF EVENTS 
HEADING INTO NOVEMBER. 
WE'LL KNOW QUICKLY BECAUSE 
DELAWARE TURNOUT IS ALWAYS VERY 
LOW IN A MIDTERM ESPECIALLY. 
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE OUR VOTE 
COUNT VERY EARLY ON THIS 
EVENING AND KNOW WHAT'S 
HAPPENING. 
>> INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SAY 
THAT. 
INTERESTING TO SAY ABOUT THE 
HEAT BECAUSE WEATHER DOES 
AFFECT TURNOUT. 
WE'LL SEE. 
NANCY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
JOINING US. 
>> I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO STAY 
HOME. 
>> I CAN'T BLAME THEM, BUT WE 
HOPE THEY GET TO THE POLLS. 
NANCY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
JOINING US. 
>>>  WELL, FACEBOOK AND TWITTER 
EXECUTIVES APPEARED ON CAPITOL 
HILL YESTERDAY. 
FACEBOOK C.O.O. 
SHERYL SANDBERG AND TWITTER 
COFOUNDER AND CEO JACK DORSEY 
TALKED ABOUT EFFORTS TO STOP 
THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON 
THE PLATFORMS. 
NIKOLE KILLION HAS MORE FROM 
CAPITOL HILL. 
>>REPORTER:  NEARLY TWO YEARS 
AFTER THE 2016 ELECTIONS, 
FACEBOOK AND TWITTER EXECUTIVES 
TOLD A SENATE PANEL THEIR 
COMPANIES WERE NOT PROPERLY 
EQUIPPED TO STOP MISINFORMATION 
CAMPAIGNS ON THEIR PLATFORMS. 
>> WE WERE TOO SLOW TO SPOT 
THIS, AND TOO SLOW TO ACT. 
THAT IS ON US. 
>> WE ARE PROUD OF HOW THAT 
FREE AND OPEN EXCHANGE HAS BEEN 
WEAPONIZED. 
WE FOUND OURSELVES UNPREPARED 
AND ILL EQUIPPED FOR THE 
IMMENSITY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT 
WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED. 
>>REPORTER:  FACEBOOK'S SHERYL 
SANDBERG AND TWITTER'S JACK 
DORSEY SAID THEY LEARNED FROM 
THE PAST AND THAT THEY ARE 
COORDINATING WITH OTHER SOCIAL 
MEDIA COMPANIES AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TO STOP BAD ACTORS. 
>> FINDING INAWE THEY WANTIC 
BEHAVIOR IS A CHALLENGE, AND I 
THINK YOU'RE SEEING US PUT REAL 
RESOURCES TO BEAR. 
>>REPORTER:  DORSEY SAID 
TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED OVER 
3,000 ACCOUNTS BELIEVED TO BE 
LINKED TO THE SAME RUSSIAN 
INTERNET AGENCY IDENTIFIED IN 
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 
MUELLER'S INDICTMENT. 
GOOGLE WAS ALSO INVITED TO THE 
SENATE HEARING BUT DECLINED THE 
INVITATION. 
ALEX JONES, HOST OF THE NOW 
COUNSELED WEB PROGRAM "INFO 
WARS" ATTENDED THE HEARING AS A 
SPECTATOR. 
>> THE REAL ELECTION MEDDLING 
IS BY FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND 
OTHERS THAT ARE SHADOW BANNING 
PEOPLE, OUTRIGHT BANNING 
PEOPLE. 
>>REPORTER:  DORSEY APPEARED 
SOLO BEFORE A HOUSE PANEL LATER 
IN THE DAY. 
>> OUR POLICIES AND OUR RHYTHMS 
DON'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION 
ANY AFFILIATION, FLU SHOT FI OR 
VIEWPOINT. 
>> DORSEY TESTIFIED THAT 
THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNT, INCLUDING 
SOME LAWMAKERS WERE 
INADVERTENTLY CAUGHT IN ITS 
FILTERING ALGORITHM. 
NIKOLE KILLION, CAPITOL HILL. 
>>> HOWARD SCHULTZ IS 
DISCUSSING LIFE AFTER 
STARBUCKS. 
HE'S STEPPING DOWN AS CHAIRMAN 
AFTER 36 YEARS AND HIS PLANS 
ALSO INCLUDE POTENTIALLY 
POLITICS. 
BUT BEFORE THAT HE'LL LEAVE THE 
COMPANY WITH A MAJOR BOOST. 
IN ITALY SCHULTZ SPOKE WITH 
"CBS THIS MORNING" FROM MILAN 
WHERE THE FIRST STARBUCKS IN 
THE COUNTRY MADE ITS DIE BY THE 
WAY TODAY. 
>> WELL, BON JOURNO. 
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE, AS YOU 
SAID. 
I WALKED THE STREETS HERE IN 
'83, AND TO THINK I COULD COME 
BACK HERE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
AND OPEN UP THE ROASTERY IN THE 
HEART OF MILAN, THE RESPONSE -- 
PEOPLE ARE BANGING ON THE DOOR 
TO GET IN, AND WE'LL HAVE THIS 
BIG GALA TONIGHT AND OPEN UP 
FOR THE DOORS TOMORROW MORNING. 
BUT THIS LITERALLY IS A 
MILESTONE MOMENT FOR THE 
COMPANY AND FOR ME. 
>> BUT, HOWARD, YOU'RE IN 
ITALY. 
THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT 
ESPRESSO. 
WHY DO YOU THINK I'D WANT TO 
TAKE MY BUSINESS THERE? 
>> WELL, AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE 
COMING HERE WITH GREAT HUMILITY 
AND RESPECT FOR THE ITALIAN 
CULTURE. 
BUT WE'RE OPENING NOT A COFFEE 
STORE BUT A ROASTERY. 
MOST ITALIANS HAVE NEVER SEEN 
COFFEE ROASTED. 
AND WHAT WE'VE CREATED REALLY 
IS THE WILLEY WONKA OF COFFEE, 
ALMOST 30,000 SQUARE FEET AND 
IT'S A LABOR OF LOVE, THE 
CRAFTSMANSHIP, THE STORE. 
WE HAD 100 ITALIAN JOURNALISTS 
HERE YESTERDAY, AND THEY WERE 
IN AWE OF WHAT WE CREATED. 
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ADD 
SOMETHING TO THE MILANESE 
CULTURE AND VALUE AND I THINK 
STARBUCKS IS GOING TO DO VERY 
WELL HERE. 
>> I ONCE HAD AN ITALIAN ALMOST 
STRANGLE ME FOR OFFERING TO 
SERVE HIM CAPPUCCINO AFTER 
BREAKFAST. 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE ITALIAN 
CULTURE, THOUGH, THAT MAKES 
THIS PITCH TO THEM WHY YOU'RE 
GOING THIS WAY? 
>> WELL, CLEARLY EVERYTHING 
THAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE 
YEARS IS STEEPED INTO THE -- 
WHAT THE ITALIANS REFER TO AS A 
NECTAR OF THE GODS WHICH IS 
ESPRESSO. 
AND I THINK THE QUALITY AND THE 
INTEGRITY OF STARBUCKS COFFEE, 
FRESHLY ROASTED IN THIS 
FACILITY, MADE BY PEOPLE WHO 
CARE SO MUCH ABOUT CUSTOMER 
SERVICE AND THE EXPRESSION OF 
COFFEE AND THE PASSION AND THE 
LOVE, AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE 
GOING TO SEE THAT THE PROOF OF 
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE IN 
THE CUP, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
SURPRISED AT THE QUALITY OF 
STARBUCKS COFFEE, AND I THINK 
THIS ENVIRONMENT -- YOU KNOW, 
WE TOOK OVER A BUILDING THAT IS 
200 YEARS OLD, IT WAS EMPTY, 
WE'VE RESTORED IT, AND IT 
REALLY IS A GIFT TO THE CITY OF 
MILAN. 
>> WELL, HOWARD, I KEEP 
THINKING THIS IS YOUR FINAL 
ACT, YOUR FINAL STORE AS 
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF STARBUCKS 
AND YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH A 
CALFENNATED BANG, BUT IT RAISES 
THE QUESTION, WHAT'S NEXT FOR 
YOU? 
ARE YOU CONSIDERING POLITICS? 
>> WELL, I KIND OF EXPECTED 
THIS QUESTION, NORAH, SO, YOU 
KNOW, WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR 
THE LAST FEW MONTHS IS THAT I 
TOOK THE SUMMER OFF FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS. 
I'VE JUST FINISHED WRITING A 
VERY IMPORTANT BOOK THAT I'VE 
HANDED IN TO RANDOM HOUSE. 
IT'LL COME OUT IN '19. 
I'M THINKING ABOUT A LOT OF 
THINGS. 
I SAID PUBLICLY THAT PERHAPS 
ONE OF THEM WILL BE PUBLIC 
OFFICE. 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I 
COULD DO PERHAPS TO HELP THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HELP PEOPLE 
WHO ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY 
THIS ADMINISTRATION BY NOT 
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. 
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. 
>> WELL, BACK HERE AT HOME 
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK BECAUSE 
SOMEONE FROM INSIDE THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION HAS RELEASED AN 
OP-ED, ESSENTIALLY TALKING 
ABOUT BEING PART OF A 
RESISTANCE EVEN THEY ARE A 
TRUMP POLITICAL APPOINTEE, BUT 
SPECIFICALLY THAT THIS 
PRESIDENT IS AMORAL, THAT HE 
DOES NOT HAVE A ROOTING THAT 
DEFINES HIS BELIEF. 
DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S TIME THAT 
THIS COUNTRY MAKES A CHANGE? 
>> WELL, WHAT I DO THINK IS 
THAT I THINK THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE ARE SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED 
BY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE 
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND 
A HALF. 
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE LONGING 
NOT ONLY IN THE U.S. BUT AROUND 
THE WORLD -- I MEAN, ITALY, AND 
I THINK IT IS A WORLDWIDE 
DESIRE FOR TRUTH, FOR CIVILITY, 
FOR DECENCY, AND I THINK THE 
WORLD IS HUNGRY FOR THE 
IDEALISM OF AMERICA AND 
AMERICA'S STANDING IN THE 
WORLD. 
SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THE 
COUNTRY, AND I GAVE A TALK LAST 
NIGHT, AND I SAID WE HAVE TO 
ASK OURSELVES WHAT KIND OF 
COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN, 
WHAT KIND OF WORLD DO WE WANT 
TO LIVE IN. 
AND AS CITIZENS, NOT ONLY AS 
POLITICIAN, BUT AS CITIZENS AND 
PARENTS, THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR 
ANY OF US TO BE A BYSTANDER, TO 
BE INDIFFERENT, BUT TO MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE AND TO BE HEARD. 
>>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND 
I.C.E. 
ARE DEMANDING TO SEE MILLIONS 
OF VOTING RECORDS IN NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
THE SUBPOENAS INCLUDE ALL 
RECORDS FROM THE STATE'S 
ELECTIONS BOARD AND OTHERS, 
INCLUDING POLL BOOKS AND 
ABSENTEE BALLOTS FROM THE PAST 
EIGHT YEARS. 
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT IS MAKING THE 
REQUEST, BUT IT FOLLOWS CHARGES 
AGAINST 19 NON-CITIZENS FOR 
ALLEGEDLY VOTING IN THE 2016 
ELECTION. 
THE REQUEST IS RAISING PRIVACY 
CONCERNS AMONG VOTER RIGHTS 
GROUPS. 
NEARLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE ARE 
ESTIMATED TO HAVE VOTED IN 
NORTH CAROLINA IN 2016. 
A TOTAL OF 41 VOTES WERE DEEMED 
POTENTIALLY SUSPECT AFTER A 
STATE AUDIT. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
CONSIDERING COMMUTING THE 
SENTENCE OF A MAN SENTENCED TO 
LIFE IN PRISON DUE TO MANDATORY 
MINIMUM SENTENCING GUIDELINES. 
HE MET YESTERDAY WITH KIM 
KARDASHIAN, HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA 
AND JUDGE KEVIN SHARP WHO GAVE 
THE 22-YEAR-OLD CHRIS YOUNG THE 
LIFE SENTENCE ON THREE STRIKES 
CONVICTION. 
WELL, YOUNG'S TWO PRIOR DRUG 
FELONIES WERE ACTUALLY MINOR 
CASES, AND SHARP SAYS HE HAD NO 
CHOICE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY 
THE LAW WAS WRITTEN. 
AND HE'S NOW FIGHTING ON 
YOUNG'S BEHALF. 
HE SPOKE TO CBS NEWS. 
>> WAS GUT WRENCHING TO DO THAT 
AND TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS 
NOTHING THAT I COULD DO. 
THIS WAS JUST A FORMALITY. 
AND AS CHRIS SPOKE BEFORE I 
SENTENCED HIM, HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT HE 
WOULD DO, AS IF SOME DAY HE'S 
GOING TO GET OUT. 
BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT 
GOING
