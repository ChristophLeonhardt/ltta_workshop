four members of the president's Homeland Security Advisory Council just walked off the job and now we know exactly why they say they couldn't stomach the administration's now retracted policy of separating families at the border and they say they were left out of the decision-making we've obtained a copy of their resignation letter which reads quote we were consulted we were we consulted we would have observed that routinely taking children from migrant parents was morally repugnant counterproductive and ill-considered we cannot tolerate association with the immigration policies of this administration nor the illusion that we are consulted on these matters joining us now one of those council members who turned in his badge David Martin David you went a step further writing your own letter to Secretary Nielsen citing quote gratuitously severe actions such as the travel ban termination of daca and commitment to a vast wall you also mention the pardoning of Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the president's attacks on the intelligence community tell us how long have you been part of the organization and what prompted you to finally say enough is enough I'm sorry I didn't hear that how long had we've been considering that yes yes there's been discontent and concern on among the members of the Homeland Security Advisory Council since the first week of the administration the travel ban was issued during that first week not only was it bad policy it was incredibly badly rolled out it just in terms of administration basic questions had not been answered guidance hadn't gone out to the field staff but so the concern had been there the Arpaio pardon the Charlottesville incident they all contributed toward that so there had been people talking about this for a while but the separation policy really crystallized it has the Advisory Council had any input in any of these things well there had been certainly some contact on on things along the way the council is not advised not in a position to be asked for its opinion on every little twist and turn of policy but we felt that this particular one was such a major change such a intrusion on basic American values family values such a harsh measure that it should have been brought to us and had there been any kind of consultation of that kind the administration would have been put on better notice about the kind of reaction that was on its way that did eventually come and that caused them to turn around their their policy but some have questioned well why didn't we act earlier there was a lot of debate among those of us who were concerned about the best way to approach this now but the the administered about the separation policy has not been cured there's obviously a lot of children's still to be reunited and it was a symbol of deeper concerns about immigration policy generally so this is a big debate that goes on at every level of this administration about boy on one hand why don't people resign on principle to protest what's going on to send a signal to the administration and then you hear in other cases why I hope they don't resign so that they can influence policy or keep them on the right track now I understand that an advisory council is not the same say as being the Secretary of State or the president's national security adviser but how do you weigh that sort of thing what did you and your colleagues who left the council sort of think about well maybe we can stay and change this from getting worse or there be greater effect to resigning and symbolizing our disapproval that's right I have a lot of my former students who are in government and career positions have asked me about what to do I've usually encouraged them to stay to help develop the details of policies in a in a more effective and humane way and to hang in there but for the council our role is limited are the chances for effectively influencing the policy seem to be limited and also because we're advisors to the secretary and a lot of these key decisions seem to be coming out of the out of the White House so it is a real dilemma but we felt that this was the time this event called for this can I just one more what did secretary Nielsen say when you resigned what does the secretary White what'd she say what was the response when you decided to resign oh we have not received at least I have not received any kind of direct response from the secretary we did receive an email from the co-chair of a Advisory Council very gracious email acknowledging that we sent him a copy and thanking us for our previous service hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest interviews and highlights you can get more MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
