from the greenhouse to the big house the BC Supreme Court advises charges against Elizabeth May a few weeks back the Green Party's lone MP and leader Elizabeth May along with the NDP's MP for Burnaby Kennedy Stuart were both arrested for violating an injunction at a Kinder Morgan work site on Burnaby Mountain now tender morgan has a court injunction that keeps protesters at least fifty meters away from two Kinder Morgan construction sites now this injunction does two things the first one it keeps Kinder Morgan employees safe from these increasingly violent protesters but it also keeps these idiotic protesters from hurting themselves because things are happening on a job site that they are just completely unfamiliar with and that of course is you know work the injunction was granted after the company said that protesters have caused delays and financial harm to trans mountain nearly every single day since the end of November now knowing full well there was a court order in place and knowing full well police were already arresting people for breaking that court order May and Stewart went down there and willfully broke it - so they were both arrested by police now the arrest it wasn't particularly harsh for MS May I mean look at this photo here are they holding her up are they escorting her to a police car or are they all going to a square dance together it sort of looked at the time like Liz Mae was exercising a little bit of her privilege to get special treatment from the justice system there were no handcuffs involved no time in the back of a police car just some weird arm locking business it looked like everyone was going easy on Elizabeth May but the BC Supreme Court while they're having none of that a judge has recommended that protesters including Mae and Stewart should all be prosecuted criminally rather than in civil court for blocking a road in violating that court order so instead of civil contempt charges which is not a criminal offence the BC Supreme Court judge recommended that the charges against Mei and Stuart be elevated changed to criminal contempt since their alleged contempt was against a court order and not Kinder Morgan itself now the case has been adjourned for at least a week as it's been sent back to the BC prosecution service and if he is convicted NDP MP Kennedy Stewart won't even be the first NDP MP who is a criminal from Burnaby there must be something in the water there NDP MP spend Robinson stole a ring from a jewelry auction house in 2004 then he returned it and then turned himself into the police a couple days later he pled guilty and was given a conditional discharge one year of probation and 1000 hours of community service and a whole lot of pity from a judge but in this instance I hope they show no pity for these two and I hope the judge is extra harsh on Liz May because she has been threatening to pull this same stupid stunt for at least a year now just watch there's no doubt that the City of Vancouver the city of Burnaby they say stop it they are in court and so are the Slayer truth of muscular mass Squamish First Nation we are not giving up this is a terrible blow and a betrayal but we do not give up and Kinder Morgan will not be built as long as there's breath in my body I'll fight this damn thing and you will go to jail of course I'll go to jail I'll block pipelines I'll stand shoulder to shoulder with First Nations this is not an issue you compromise on so careful what you wish for Elizabeth May because you just might get it you could be finding out that Green is the new orange may could go from minding her organic garden to work in hard time in the prison farm for the rebel DUP media I'm Shiela gunnery join us for the largest rallies ever organized against the carbon tax Saturday April 14th at the Alberta Legislature in Edmonton from 1 to 3 and on Sunday April 15 at City Hall in Calgary from 1 to 3 p.m. we've got great speakers already confirmed everyone is welcome but please remember it's a family friendly of so family-friendly signs only for more information go to repeal the carbon tax com
