the balcony and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to chat kids</font>

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,480

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,170
camera for five minutes and editing

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,280

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,739
something kids there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quiter came</font>

11
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,100
from Phil come Fight Club which I love

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,440
because it reflects the majority of

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,770
people and that is the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,199
people listen is because they're waiting

15
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,500
for that sounds talk you listen to

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,090
people when it's help you be in problems

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,369
and this computer looking so I decided

18
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,229
it's been a bit like than all the way

19
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,830
they hope Allah forgive it I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,340
the hotel and I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,979
where I was filming all the miserable

22
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,860
faces because in a place like this as

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,420
you see how could you possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,240
miserable because you have everything

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,280
you could ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> won it's all inclusive</font>

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,030
it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cell etc it's a haven and I</font>

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,020
was going to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video where I'll</font>

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,479
sneakily film all the miserable faces

29
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,540
and make a mockery of it but comes to

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,710
conclusions they though I may as well

31
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,100
filming at me tensions been building up

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,790
inside me for weeks and bounce now and

33
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,240
it's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rollercoaster for me and</font>

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,070
it's been non-stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you remember</font>

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,770
the video the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font>

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,590
that was the start of it and since I

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,629
made that video so much stuff has

38
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,549
happened and it's been non-stop whether

39
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:26,629
it be be me working to save up for this

40
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera the same up from a u.s. trip</font>

47
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,510
differently I wish I'd said which I had

48
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,629
said or I feel in a different state of

49
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,030
mind so I'm sorry this is not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

50
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,980
any structure to it but I guess it's

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,370
just my train of thought one of them

52
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,930
space other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> finds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of someone I</font>

53
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,510
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoken to or I've never met by</font>

54
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,989
chad from up from time to time and she

55
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,209
was a variable to go she said some am

56
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,379
the thing of me is when she talks to me

57
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,599
she feels like bitch there's nothing she

58
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,940
ever says where I don't already know it

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,799
and that's the same with most people up

60
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,750
conversation with me I'll jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gun</font>

61
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,549
because when they tell me something a

62
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,340
problem will give me advice it will

63
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,989
trigger a memory and then I'll know what

64
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:34,340
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one my</font>

65

head of the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes life boring and</font>

66
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,569
maybe I should be going back teeny

67

68
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,669
with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do expand my</font>

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,960
slight little things why mine YouTube

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,730

miserable in a situation like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this maybe</font>

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,180
doesn't mean they're not grateful but

84
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,920
problems and state of mind is nothing to

85
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,500
do with materialism is to do with

86
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,700
emotion and problems in life you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

87
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,470
all the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world and you can</font>

still be miserable and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have</font>

89
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,660
nothing and be happy to pass on the pan

I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the life of God although</font>

91
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,010
the moment I've got a lot happening to

it's out of control I can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

116
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,390
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> on EEG basic people being saying</font>

117
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,620
what sort of videos have you been doing

118
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,750
miles and people always that every video

119
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,770
they'll always be something too

120
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,480
disappointed he'll always tell me they

121
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">are subscribe do I care all i care but</font>

122
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,290
in terms of its what they want to do if

123
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,300
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to subscribe do it you know</font>

124
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,850
because at the end of the day the people

125
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">I when watching my videos people who</font>

126
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,910
enjoy it people you get site from it and

127
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,640
people miss the classic looks and the

128
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
reason I hadn't been doing them is

129
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,240
because every day has been so eventful

them or i can just go watch this video

153
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:08,120
because it so many people in YouTube who

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,719
but the reason a lot of people attracts

159
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me is because I'm a real person by</font>

160
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,490
talk real I talk exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's on my</font>

161
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,219
mind I talk sense about what's happening

162
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,560
in my life I've never like anything to

163
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,440
hide as some people who are real they

164
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,719
will make videos where they act it out i

165
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,389
do some acting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do a variety know but</font>

166
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:41,380
what I do my login they'll do<font color="#CCCCCC"> flux which</font>

167
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,310
may be a comical and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

168
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,110
it's nachi about them it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

169
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,740
what's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> their half there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

170
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,019
who do so I understand that not everyone

171
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,550
does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a few people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

172
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,690
think that's what attracts people to me

173
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,329
but my point is that the facts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i am</font>

174
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,459
so truthfully honest coming up to 200

175
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,670
videos now come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a million</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> views</font>

176
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,050
5000 subscribers thank you so much

177
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,600
people my whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> life's on the internet</font>

178
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,199
and therefore you know it's as if that

179
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,380
because everything is documented almost

180
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,029
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are documented where does it go</font>

181
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,890
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to start making more stuff</font>

182
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:37,089
to document and it's just a bit crazy it

183
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:38,470
was something negative effects on my

184
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,570
life it won't be doing it comes from

185
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,310
that person to to make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,620
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> also my space to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reflect exist so</font>

187
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,320
many people online i<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect and just</font>

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,680
throwing ideas out<font color="#E5E5E5"> here on internet and</font>

189
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,300
people care they'll come forward and

190
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,920
they'll email me and tell me what they

191
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">think and help me free something and</font>

192
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:06,270
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome i did a video last</font>

193
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,820
naturally but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was from the 9th full</font>

194
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,220
called midnight milling that's not talk

195
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">rafi back because i believe the video</font>

196
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the reason was not because the</font>

197
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,700
majority there might be because the

198
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,399
majority did like it but there was a few

199
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,380
people who took<font color="#E5E5E5"> offense and therefore</font>

200
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,779
made the judgment night by showing they

201
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">respect women in that video a normal</font>

202
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,330
talk about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to satisfy them and</font>

203
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,020
so they do get some feedback from me I

204
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,730
can understand now but at the time there

205
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,500
was all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us in a room editing it</font>

206
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,440
laughing in it sober and going they want

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able YouTube let's do it and that</font>

208
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">was why and people say it was</font>

209
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">disrespectful for women I think it's all</font>

210
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,700
talk to people i categorize people

211
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,820
although we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in categories if an</font>

212
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,589
individual wants to do something why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

213
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,480
this didn't have fun but if the group of

214
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,380
peoples offended by that everyone has

215
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,970
opinions in life everyone has

216
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,589
differences in life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people have</font>

217
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,300
different interpretations and this is

218
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,880
the big issue out youtube and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

219
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,709
this was laid to rest the world back but

220
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:15,810
it's like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charlie incident</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

221
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,459
believe it when someone say hi about me

222
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,940
because he does what he does and maybe

223
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,310
his intentions were good but from our

224
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,990
actions it could be argued<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

225
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,980
not he asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to say sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

226
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explained myself but by then</font>

227
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,540
he'd already had so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> my way</font>

228
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,060
he threw to me thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

229
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,160
let's say find the cyber screen anything

230
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,579
they can get

231
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,299
to me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if a hazer person coming</font>

232
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,139
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube that says q</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's all it</font>

233
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,009
says although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know you not to take</font>

234
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,420
much nice because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just somethings</font>

235
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,339
quickly tie that but it does hit you

236
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,519
back a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and it's just it's</font>

237
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,579
interesting but for someone to get 500

238
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,799
people's email me make videos blade<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

239
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,850
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> key it was just incredible and</font>

240
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,619
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one video I made which I</font>

241
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:16,379
expressed issues which were real people

242
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,730
want to see the real me and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

243
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">show you the real thing and I have</font>

244
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,720
thoughts or not a perfect person<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

245
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,239
so many people think I am I made a

246
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,709
stupid mistake maybe a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> myspace</font>

247
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:31,649
some may think but in human and everyone

248
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look inside them and ask</font>

249
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,639
themselves questions are you perfect and

250
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,379
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chances are you're not and you</font>

251
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,420
probably have lots of skeletons in your

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,009
closet<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not perfect but I could</font>

253
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:46,110
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you a couple of secrets</font>

254
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,420
which if you heard it<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respect for</font>

255
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">me you would go through the roof because</font>

256
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to say is I'm not your average</font>

257
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,509
going and you can interpret that any way

258
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:59,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want but the clues and the fact that</font>

259
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,199
I said don't know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get often in</font>

260
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,569
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life and that's gonna be a whole</font>

261
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:04,799
another video which I'll probably talk

262
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,649
about soon I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's real girlfriend</font>

263
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:13,410
by turned down because I'd rather have a

264
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,059
friendship and risk it the same that

265
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:21,569
could potentially go wrong why am I

266
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:27,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking this because on exposure myself</font>

267
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,639
and you know why is because the majority

268
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,889
of people were about a good people and

269
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">then d come around and people are</font>

270
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,499
respectful I've traveled I'm traveling

271
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:44,199
the world I traveled America a child

272
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,350
anywhere else me people<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube</font>

273
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,699
which very few people do and people say

274
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:53,709
I'm doing just a popular able you know

275
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,470
some point to do stuff which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font>

276
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,689
get bigger but the point is made by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan</font>

277
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:01,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">but isn't it about why my dinner and the</font>

278
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,980
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it is because when i</font>

279
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,009
started by an email saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like what</font>

280
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">cut see you inspired me I don't get more</font>

281
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,170
and more of them every day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Laura get</font>

282
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">them want to push to get more exposure</font>

283
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,540
because if I can inspire people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to be</font>

284
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">truthful and be real and free themselves</font>

285
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,610
from the book that runs through this

286
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,819
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know is that such a bad</font>

287
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,989
thing where do my videos go from here

288
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:30,610
people as always period at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

289
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,089
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't even know what the</font>

290
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this video is you tell me what the</font>

291
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,389
point this video is he telling me again

292
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:42,670
from this because right now I've lost

293
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,649
all motivation with what I'm doing

294
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,990
because I'm sort of drifting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oblivion</font>

295
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,009
not sure where I'm going life so many

296
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:57,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunities it's crazy and as I walk</font>

297
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">away from this camera and begin editing</font>

298
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">it already think of stuff though I</font>

299
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:03,999
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sale why I should not said</font>

300
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,529
something but then I have a twist a

301
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,019
little but most of time when I do videos

302
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,449
i leave stuff in because I want people

303
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:13,119
to see the real me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's interesting</font>

304
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,949
how you do want video if you would go on

305
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:20,379
subscribing and it's like because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

306
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:27,100
don't want me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest you know not</font>

307
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,660
everyone agrees about everything in life

308
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,139
and it sank you got accept and it's a

309
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:37,029
common thing like if I do something

it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about opinion right the point</font>

362
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:05,390
research everything sinfully it it's the

363
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:14,690
moral dilemma of humanity and society

364
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,029
because not everyone agrees everyone has

365
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,230
different views because everyone has

366
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,230
different mentalities and it's the

367
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,610
reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> grieves fool is because</font>

368
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,890
there are coincidences and people cling

369
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,179
together because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

370
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,309
people with the same ideals<font color="#CCCCCC"> close to</font>

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,320

396
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,429
it's nicer to talk to a camera which

397
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,039
will go out into the whole wide world

398
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,740
until it reaches people care or people

399
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,230
who want to scrutinize me as opposed to

400
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,559
me chained to people who may be close to

gonna go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my mind is are they really</font>

403
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,649
listening or are they just waiting for
