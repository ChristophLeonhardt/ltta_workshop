I think the best time to take a risk at anything including leaving your job and starting your own business is the moment you think about it and I'm gonna tell you why because the most truthful part of your existence is what your gut tells you and yet you sit with your gut and ignore it for day two days for three weeks and it's a really odd thing that happens your left brain kicks in and there's always probably ten times more reasons not to do something then there is to do something so the longer you sit the more reasons you have in the negative column well this could go wrong that could go or I shouldn't really did they do that because you lose your courage as you sit on things so your long list starts piling up if when you're inspired you think you know what I've had it I hate my boss I have only three thousand dollars saved but I'm gonna find a way you know what I'm just gonna I'm just gonna leave assume you know have kids to feed in a mortgage which gets in the way when you're older I remember when Ramone Simone walked into the Fort Lee diner and said to me a smart girl like you belongs in New York City I was in New Jersey and then later on said a smart girl with your personality really would make a great real estate broker I quit that waitressing job that day done but it was a sponge a native my gut calling me that made me do it and I really think that's the time you do it the sanest people in life that I've met my entire life were never people who tried to go into business for themselves and fail but I have met so many people said you know I had an idea once and I always wondered if I always wondered if you don't want to be one of these should've could've people because what you're really doing is thinking less of yourself and not having done it and so again the best time is the moment of Inception of the idea is really the best time to hit the floor running
