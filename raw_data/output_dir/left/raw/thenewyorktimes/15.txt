1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,060
Fascist — people
like to use the word

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,310
to describe any
politician they don’t like

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,450
on both sides of the aisle.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,360
Now it might seem
like an exaggeration

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,740
to call Trump a fascist.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,540
I mean, he’s not
calling for a genocide

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,370
or imprisoning his own
people without due process.

8
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,090
But I want you to reflect
for a moment on his words,

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,560
on his political tactics —

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,330
on his rhetoric, if you will.

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,970
I’ve devoted the last
decade of my life

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,460
to studying
fascist propaganda.

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,550
And if you use history
and philosophy as a guide,

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,060
it’s easy to see parallels
between Trump’s words

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,870
and those of the most
reviled fascists in history.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,220
That scares me.

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,380
And it should scare you, too.

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,670
[music]

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,165
We’ve flirted with
fascism before.

20
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:51,600
“They wore Hitler’s uniforms,
but they wrapped themselves

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,160
in the American flag.”

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,550
But how are we seeing these
images echoed in 21st-century

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,175
America?

24
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:58,245
“Build that wall!”

25
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:01,650
Well, the formula for fascism
is surprisingly simple.

26
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,750
And it gets repeated a lot.

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,510
Italy and Germany, of
course, but fascist movements

28
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,810
are on the rise today in
India, Myanmar, Hungary,

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,840
Turkey, and right here
in the United States.

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,820
No matter where
they come from,

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,020
fascist politicians everywhere
are cut from the same cloth.

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,380
Fascism first takes root
when politicians conjure up

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,510
a faith in a mythic past —

34
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,020
a past supposedly destroyed
by liberals, feminists

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,390
and immigrants.

36
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,950
For Mussolini, it
was the Roman Empire.

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,690
For Erdogan in Turkey,
it’s the Ottomans.

38
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,970
Hungary’s Viktor Orban
rewrote the Constitution with

39
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,890
the goal of “making
Hungary great again” —

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,025
a line that sounded
great to someone.

41
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:45,660
“Did you ever
hear this before?

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,810
‘Make America great again.’”

43
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,567
[cheering and applause]

44
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,570
Fascists create an
overwhelming sense

45
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,780
of nostalgia for a past
that is racially pure,

46
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,930
traditional and patriarchal.

47
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,070
From Mussolini to
Hitler to Erdogan,

48
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,700
fascist leaders position
themselves as father figures

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,975
and strongmen.

50
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:08,383
“I want to thank you for
getting this country moving.”

51
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:10,210
“I can’t thank you
enough for the privilege

52
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,455
that you’ve given me.”

53
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,045
“Greatest privilege
of my life.”

54
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:16,570
As long as he — and
yes, it’s always a he —

55
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,750
remains in power,
everything is possible.

56
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,117
Without him the whole
system collapses.

57
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:23,950
“I’ll tell you what.

58
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,430
If I ever got impeached, I
think the market would crash.

59
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,395
I think everybody
would be very poor.”

60
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:31,270
Once you’ve got
your mythic past,

61
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,160
you need the next ingredient.

62
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,970
Division, whether it’s between
Germans and Jews, Hindus

63
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,940
and Muslims, citizens
and foreigners, whites

64
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,000
and blacks, fascists
succeed by turning groups

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,070
against each other.

66
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,640
The Nazis said Jews had no
value because they supposedly

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,010
did no mental or
physical work.

68
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,500
In Myanmar, the Rohingya
have been denounced

69
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,830
as rapists and criminals,
a line which will sound

70
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,035
familiar to many Mexicans.

71
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:00,770
“They’re bringing drugs.

72
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,300
They’re bringing crime.

73
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,410
They’re rapists.

74
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,250
And some, I assume,
are good people.”

75
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,460
When you divide, it’s
easier to control.

76
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,530
Once fascism has
taken root, it

77
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,770
spreads through propaganda — 
and, in particular, a kind

78
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,465
of anti-intellectualism.

79
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:19,090
“They can make anything
bad, because they

80
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,190
are the fake, fake,
disgusting news.”

81
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,130
Fascists attack the
truth because truth is

82
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,215
central to a free democracy.

83
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,684
“It’s somebody’s version of
the truth, not the truth.”

84
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:32,350
“Truth is truth.

85
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,550
I don’t mean to go — “

86
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,720
“No, it isn’t truth!

87
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,845
Truth isn’t truth!”

88
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:38,230
This environment
creates a Petri dish

89
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,100
for conspiracy theories.

90
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,720
Have you seen this symbol
at a Trump rally recently?

91
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,360
It’s a sign for a popular
online conspiracy theory

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,620
that the “deep state” is
working to bring down Trump.

93
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,520
It’s not a million miles
away from Viktor Orban’s

94
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,880
wild campaigns against a
global Jewish conspiracy.

95
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,190
With the truth under attack
and lies running wild,

96
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,285
no one can agree on
what’s true anymore.

97
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:17,230
And fascists love it
when that happens.

98
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,149
You might think I’m
trying to frighten you

99
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,070
by making these parallels.

100
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,540
And do you know what?

101
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,620
I am.

102
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,525
My parents survived
the Holocaust.

103
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:28,030
And my grandmother,
in her memoir,

104
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,680
wrote about how
Jews in Germany

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,340
didn’t see the Nazi threat
until it was too late.

106
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,730
“In 1937, we were still
able to leave the country,"

107
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,570
she wrote.

108
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,280
“We could still
live in our homes.

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,620
We could still worship
in our temples.

110
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,760
We were in a ghetto.

111
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,880
But the majority of our
people were still alive.”

112
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,640
I want you to be scared,
because if you’re not

113
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,580
worried about encroaching
fascism in America,

114
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,580
before long, it will
start to feel normal.

115
00:04:54,580 --> 00:00:00,000
And when that happens,
we’re all in trouble.
