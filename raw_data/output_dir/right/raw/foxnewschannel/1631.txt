1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,684
WILL BE ANY GOOD.

2
00:00:02,684 --> 00:00:04,019
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF PUBLIC

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,287
SAFETY AND KEEPING IT CONTAINED

4
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:06,989
IN ONE PLACE, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD

5
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:09,925
THING THAT IT'S COMING, ANYWAY.

6
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:11,326
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS ONE MAXINE

7
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:12,728
WATERS OF CALIFORNIA IS BACK.

8
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:14,129
NOT THAT SHE WENT ANYWHERE.

9
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:15,264
SHE RECENTLY GOT INTO A FIGHT ON

10
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,733
THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE WITH

11
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:18,767
REPUBLICAN MIKE KELLY.

12
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,969
SHE SAID THAT CAR DEALERS ARE

13
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:21,537
RACIST.

14
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:22,071
HERE'S PART OF IT.

15
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,940
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IN 2018,

16
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,875
WE ARE ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS

17
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,079
SEEING THE DENIAL OF SOME OF MY

18
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,680
COLLEAGUES ABOUT DISCRIMINATION

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,183
IN THE AUTO LENDING BUSINESS.

20
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:38,053
>> TO IMPUGN THE INTEGRITY OF

21
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:41,590
AUTOMOBILE LENDING PEOPLE IS

22
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,624
BEYOND REPROACH.

23
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:45,727
>> I AM MORE OFFENDED AS AN

24
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:46,595
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN AND YOU

25
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:47,696
WILL EVER BE.

26
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:49,231
AND THIS BUSINESS ABOUT MAKING

27
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,934
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT IS YOUR

28
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,302
PRESIDENT THAT IS DIVIDING THIS

29
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:53,635
COUNTRY.

30
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:54,570
>> Tucker: I AM MORE OFFENDED

31
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,008
THAN YOU WILL EVER BE, THEREFORE

32
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,711
I WHEN!

33
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:05,480
MARK STEIN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST

34
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,316
AND ALL-PURPOSE GENIUS JOINS US

35
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,917
TONIGHT, AND LONGTIME

36
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,119
CONNOISSEUR OF THE MAXINE

37
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:10,452
WATERS.

38
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,921
SO TO ME IT'S FASCINATING NOT

39
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:14,723
THAT MAXINE WATERS EXISTS, YOU

40
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:16,325
WANT PEOPLE LIKE THAT AROUND

41
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:16,925
BECAUSE IT'S HILARIOUS.

42
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,260
BUT THAT SHE HAS SUDDENLY BECOME

43
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,796
ELEVATED TO THE STATUS OF HERO

44
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:21,530
IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

45
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,866
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?

46
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,034
>> IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT

47
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,803
SHE IS NOT WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC

48
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:30,739
PARTY AS SELF-EVIDENTLY

49
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:36,311
RIDICULOUS AS THE CREEPY PORN

50
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:39,081
LAWYER THAT YOU WERE TALKING

51
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:40,716
ABOUT.

52
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:42,518
MEGAN DOESN'T KNOW IT, BUT HE

53
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,720
HAS JUST DECIDED TO SWING BY AND

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,521
DO IT.

55
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,789
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

56
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,925
MAXINE WATERS, IS THAT THIS IS

57
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:54,029
SOMEONE WHO, FOR EXAMPLE, SHE IS

58
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:56,064
CLOSE FRIENDS WITH LOUIS

59
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,100
FARRAKHAN, WHO BELIEVES HE HAS

60
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,736
TAKEN UP IN A SPACECRAFT TO

61
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:02,971
COMMUTE WITH THE GHOST OF ELIJAH

62
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:08,509
MOHAMMED, AND OTHER ISLAM SPACE

63
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,511
AGENTS ONCE A MONTH.

64
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,612
AND MAYBE HE TAKES MAXINE UP

65
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,381
THERE WITH HIM ONCE A MONTH.

66
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,349
WHICH BY THE WAY, I WOULD BE IN

67
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,918
FAVOR OF THAT.

68
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:17,452
IF THE SPACE ALIENS ENCOUNTER

69
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:19,154
MAXINE WATERS AND THINK SHE IS A

70
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:19,988
TYPICAL EARTHLING, THEY WOULD

71
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:22,324
HAVE NO PLANS TO COME NEAR THIS

72
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:23,158
PLANET.

73
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:25,627
SO THEY WOULD BE PERFORMING A

74
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,596
USEFUL SERVICE IF THEY DID THAT.

75
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:30,732
IT'S ACTUALLY EXTRAORDINARY TO

76
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:31,500
ME, THIS.

77
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,435
FOR EXAMPLE, SHE RECENTLY CALLED

78
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:36,104
THE TRUMP HOTEL IN WASHINGTON A

79
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:37,539
CRIMINAL LOOKING HOTEL.

80
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,409
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO LIVES IN A

81
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,543
FOREIGN MILLION-DOLLAR HOUSE,

82
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:45,247
AND IN THAT SENSE, SUMS UP WHAT

83
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:48,217
KANYE WEST WAS TALKING ABOUT,

84
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:50,719
THE HOLE, WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS

85
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,520
DONE FOR ME LATELY?

86
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,355
WHAT HAS THE MORTGAGING THE

87
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:54,957
ENTIRE FUTURE OF ONE DEMOGRAPHIC

88
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,226
GROUP TO THE LIKES OF MAXINE

89
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,794
WATERS ACTUALLY DONE FOR THE

90
00:02:58,794 --> 00:02:59,528
MAN?

91
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:00,829
THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT I

92
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,633
THINK MORE AND MORE ARE ASKING.

93
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:07,269
>> Tucker: BUT FOR

94
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,338
GARDEN-VARIETY LIBERALS WHO IN A

95
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:12,441
NORMAL TIME WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM

96
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,277
WITH MAXINE WATERS' RHETORIC --

97
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:16,311
SHE JUST GOES TOO FAR.

98
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:17,813
THEY HAVE WOKEN UP IN THE LAST

99
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,514
YEAR AND DECIDED THAT THEY

100
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,949
REALLY LIKE MAXINE WATERS.

101
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,417
AND SHE SPEAKS FOR THEM.

102
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,519
IS THERE NO ONE ON THE LEFT THAT

103
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,723
SAYS, WAIT A SECOND, SHE'S TOO

104
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:28,557
CRAZY.

105
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:30,892
SHE DISCREDITS US.

106
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:33,395
WHERE ARE THOSE VOICES?

107
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:37,099
>>  >> Mark: THE THING IS, SHE

108
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:37,899
MADE "TIME" MAGAZINE.

109
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:40,035
FOR ANYONE WHO WASN'T AWARE,

110
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:40,936
"TIME" MAGAZINE IS STILL OUT

111
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:42,938
THERE AND PUBLISHING EVERY WEEK.

112
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,339
SHE MADE THE "TIME" MAGAZINE

113
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:46,308
LIST OF THE 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL

114
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:49,711
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHICH IS

115
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:50,512
PATENTLY ABSURD.

116
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:51,780
"TIME" MAGAZINE AT SOME POINT

117
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,048
USED TO PRETEND TO BE

118
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:53,915
INTERNATIONAL.

119
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:56,118
SO THEY PUT THE DEPUTY FISHER AS

120
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,119
MINISTER OF THE SOUTH SANDWICH

121
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:57,886
ISLANDS ON THE LIST BECAUSE HE'S

122
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:02,391
REALLY MAKING HIS NAME AS A

123
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:06,528
PLAYER IN THE SCENE

124
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:06,962
NEGOTIATIONS.

125
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:08,163
INSTEAD, THEY PUT MAXINE WATERS

126
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,899
ON THERE, WHO IS TOTALLY

127
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,235
UNINFLUENTIAL, EXCEPT OUTSIDE OF

128
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:16,704
A VERY TINY ORE COTERIE OF

129
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:17,406
HARD-CORE ACTIVISTS WHO CHANT

130
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:20,676
ALONG WITH HER WHEN SHE SAYS,

131
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,711
IMPEACH 45 AS SHE DID RECENTLY

132
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:23,845
AT A MEMORIAL SERVICE.

133
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,881
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE THESE

134
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,416
ORGAN DONOR CARDS AND SAYING, IF

135
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,018
I GET KILLED IN A FATAL ROAD

136
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:31,219
ACCIDENT, GIVE ALL MY PARTY

137
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,322
PARTS TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS THEM?

138
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,324
I'M GOING TO CARRY A MAXINE

139
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:36,825
WATERS CARD IN MY WALLET SAYING,

140
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:39,795
IF I GET KILLED IT, I DON'T WANT

141
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,365
HER CHANTING "IMPEACH 45" AT MY

142
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:43,865
MEMORIAL SERVICE.

143
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:47,102
THIS HAS NO APPEAL OTHER THAN

144
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:50,706
BEYOND A VERY HARD-CORE COTERIE.

145
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,307
BUT THAT COTERIE IS VERY

146
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:53,508
ESTABLISHED IN THE MEDIA WHICH

147
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:54,943
IS WHY "TIME" MAGAZINE MADE

148
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:58,747
THEMSELVES LOOK FOOLS BY PUTTING

149
00:04:58,747 --> 00:00:00,000
HER ON THIS VERY INFLUENTIAL 100
