Bergen and fired by the Trump campaign and he called me up for some reason I can't remember what it was and he was to say it to say it mildly a kooky fellow who exactly is Sam number well the Washington Post who says nunberg was an early member of Trump's political team when the moguls potential candidacy was seen mostly as a stunt in 2014 as Trump continued a long-running flirtation with higher office nunberg was at his side BuzzFeed says quote he comes on a bit strong as you know according to Roger stone right Roger stone is a woman more disgusting political operatives in the business because I mean within a week of my meeting him he was going around telling people I was his mentor he's got clips but as they say when men Berg is 36 years old and he picked up a law degree from Toro College in 2009 apparently according to BuzzFeed his first foray into presidential campaigning came in 2007 when he worked as a volunteer for the Romney campaign while attending law school and he was put in charge of organizing turnout for the New York City GOP straw poll and he helped pull up an upset win for Romney over Rudy Giuliani he then went to work for the American Center for Law and Justice which is a Christian conservative Legal Foundation run by Jay Sekulow who works for Trump right now and of course he has made the rounds in the media he was ousted in the middle of the last campaign by the Trump campaign the campaign apparently thought that he was he was a destructive person helped Hicks said quote he's a highly self-destructive individual who makes routine calls begging for his job back this is the interview of a desperate person who is trying to hang on and stay relevant the Trump campaign downgraded him to low-level part-time consultants at the time of his firing his first meeting with Trump apparently is on tape this is from when he was a kid and apparently he met Trump at a WWE event which is perfectly fitting here is tape from that time Donald Trump invited the young somnom book right into the heart of the action we were sitting like behind Trump and he had us move to the first row and another section and it was actually funny because I ended up getting on the video for Wrestlemania with my father we were doing like the bushwacker so there is sam nunn Berg very young Trump political advisor and apparently he was sued during the last election cycle Trump sued him for like ten million dollars claiming he broke a confidentiality agreement or at least threatened to sue him so yeah sam nunn Berg is a colorful character say the least well he's now being investigated by the Muller investigation because the Moller investigation is talking to every single person ever including they haven't talked to me but I think I may be the only person in America they've left to talk to so they want to talk to Sam Nunn Berg so nunberg decides that it's worthwhile to go on every television show he can possibly find and go kind of crazy so he goes on MSNBC and he explains that if Muller wants to interview him he's not going to do the interview in fact he doesn't mind being sent to jail no big deal so it starts off with this at MSNBC if they're trying to build a case against Roger I'm not gonna be part of it I'm not Roger didn't do anything Roger didn't do anything except get treated like crap by Donald Trump the president you keep saying you don't think there'll be a consequence what if the quality for that is going to jail Sam you're not gonna send me to jail you know what mr. Muller if he wants to send me to jail he could send me to jail and then and then I'll laugh about it and I don't make a bigger spectacle that I am on your TV show right now well sir I don't know what they're gonna do okay there was a woman named Susan mcdougal who during the Obama administration refused to testify and she ended up going to jail so this would not be the first time that somebody who's refused to testify or talk to the FBI and they've ended up in jail and then it gets even worse own unbirth apparently was on CNN Jake Tapper and he actually starts asking Jake Tapper whether he should cooperate with Muller so he's just going crazy live on TV he called him to every major television show he called into New York City one yesterday here he is with Jake Tapper and look at the incredulity on tappers base and we want to hear you cooperate should I spend 80 hours comes over my emails shake if it were me I would I mean it's just asking my opinion just because it sounds like a pain but he is the special counsel and he does have every email I talked to Steve and Roger stone eight tons a day do you know what a new well I do I go well I do I have to life and special prosecutors are not fair I guess I would I would cooperate were me but you know I'm a different breed of cat Jeffords puzzled by life right here and then sad number calls into another show and he explains that President Trump really didn't go far enough during the campaign the president Trump should have had Bill Clinton's alleged in an alleged illegitimate black child at the debate this is him calling into MSNBC and talking with Katy tur wasn't some smart idea that we had for us to be fired and then we were to get the emails to Russia if Roger and me were there Katy we would have had the Benghazi parents there at the first debate we would have had Bill Clinton's illegitimate black child there at the second debate and we would have had the women there okay so he was just going wild on TV yesterday call Sarah Huckabee Sanders a fat slob he suggests that there's something there to the Trump Russia investigation says he's not going to talk to Muller but he thinks that there's something going on with the Trump Russia investigation he thinks that term probably colluded with Russia here's nunberg yesterday saying that Lou Dobbs and Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity are gonna be very embarrassed when all of the Trump brushes stuff comes out and by the way you're gonna be fine when it comes out what he did but people like Sean Hannity Lou Dobbs Jimmy and Piero they're gonna have to be they're gonna be very embarrassed yes yes so the big question here was is Sam number the crazy person and that's what everybody who's watching yesterday's watching this go on and they were thinking is this person a crazy person and if he is a crazy person is it moral to put a crazy person on TV just to get President Trump and you can see that members of the media themselves people who are interviewing him are suggesting that he's either drunk or high or crazy on TV yesterday ari Melbourne over at MSNBC actually asked Sam Nunn Berg if he is if he's feeling stressed out because he says people are worried about you Sam you and I have both been around these types of situations these types of probes they can be very stressful even for people who are completely innocent did nothing wrong it can be stressful how are you holding up and do you want to take more time to think this through could you change your mind I'm not gonna answer something so why does this this is so ridiculous I'm not gonna give them every email I had with Steve bandana Roger stone I communicate with them every day and are you are you feeling okay you feeling stressed out like this no and I'm feeling kind of I want to see what mr. Miller does it's never been done before okay and then he goes on Erin Burnett on sienna era Burnett says you smell like you are drunk on the air right now like there's an actual thing that happened on TV yesterday you know I've or you're sitting very close to me yeah we talked earlier about what people in the White House were saying about you yeah I've know whether you you were you were drinking or on drugs or whatever they were what had happened today I'm talking to you yeah I have smelled alcohol well you have another drink so that's not no and then he says but he is not anti depressant so here is the big question okay there are two big questions one does this guy have anything useful to say the answer seems to be no number it doesn't have anything useful to say so the question becomes why are the media having him on and there's really a larger question which is do the media have a responsibility not to put people on TV who are humiliating themselves and making reality TV show spectacles of themselves and this is a real open question because is nunberg is it their job to to actually not put him on the air if he's drunk or if he's crazy so I would say the Erin Burnett does the worst job here because she actually apparently thinks he's drunk presumably if an Obama official walked in completely drunk off his butt and walked into the CNN studios security would be called they wouldn't put him on the air so if Erin Burnett actually thought that Sam Nunn Berg was drunk or crazy or off his rocker why put him on the air and the answer is because all these people in the media think that Sam Nunn Berg is going to suddenly drop the bomb about president Trump or because they think that it's humiliating to the Trump administration to have once had somebody like Sam Nunn Berthe working for them so on the one hand you have to say that the media their bias their attempts to get Trump have gone too far there are a lot of members of the media or so interested in getting Trump or he will awaiting trunk that they're willing to violate their own journalistic standards over at Axios the journalists there Jim VandeHei particularly is ripping into other members of the media this is just spectacle that there is no news value to this whatsoever you're putting on somebody who's clearly having a mental breakdown on national TV and you're doing so for the ratings and because you hate President Trump and that wouldn't be a shock that wouldn't be a shock I mean when you look at the media's desperation to get Trump it really has reached fever pitch I mean they are now reporting on things like CNN now traveled to Thailand they sent somebody to Thailand to dig up clues about Trump okay so first last month the network actually sent a reported saint-petersburg to literally dig around in a dumpster looking for leads about president Trump and now they sent a reporter to Bangkok to speak with a prostitute who claims that she has goods on the Trump camps alleged collusion with Russia according to grey being calm the woman her name is Anastasia by shukhevich who's also described as a sex coach is currently in prison and hopes that America will offer her Asylum in exchange for her story so CNN promptly sent a reporter over there his name is Ivan Watson he met with the woman in reported quote she is she described herself as a seductress this woman claims to have evidence of Russian meddling in the u.s. election the question is this a desperate ploy to get out of jail or as her friend claims is this young woman truly in danger because she knows too much it's a CNN has heiped everything that is possible the hype about Trump and Russia obviously and that's pretty damning stuff when it comes to why they're having people like same number on TV I don't know that that's the whole story don't I want to be fair to CNN I want to be fair to MSNBC you know explain in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Dollar Shave Club so dollarshaveclub.com the folks who will make give you everything you need to feel look and smell your best it's not just that they have the best razors in the business though they do it's not just that they have the magical fame dr.

there something to be said for the media not actually being supremely responsible for what Sam Nunn Berg did here so at the Atlantic McKay Coppins who has been following Sam Nunn work for a long time as a reporter over the Atlantic used to be a BuzzFeed he has a long piece here about what Sam Nunn Berg did was actually on purpose so it says it was just after 8:00 p.m. on Monday night and the suddenly famous ham nunberg had phoned me from Dorian's Red Hand restaurant a yuppie hangout on Manhattan's Upper East Side where he was reveling in his triumph after announcing earlier that day his intention to defy a grand jury subpoena he says he received in the Russia investigation the former Trump aide had spent the day conducting a manic media blitz popping up on multiple cable news programs granting interviews to dozens of journalists and hijacking the news cycle with car crash procession of blustery sound bikes legal experts were warning his failure to cooperate with Muller's investigation could put him in serious legal jeopardy but none Berg was in a celebratory mood so when I talked to number of months ago he was always in a celebratory mood this is a guy who's kind of manic he said can you report this he says you have to report this the champ champ does whatever the f he wants the champ champ apparently is a reference to one of his favorite UFC fighters and apparently he was it he was alternating between an unalloyed bravado and a kind of meta amusement so what exactly was he doing what exactly what he was he doing apparently the mystery of his motivations had hovered over the day's astonishing events theories attempting to explain his bizarre behavior proliferated quickly according to Coppins some believed he's responding to being caught in a genuine conspiracy auditioning for immunity perhaps are covering up crimes admitted and committed by allies in the president's orbit but here's it none Berg's own explanation after being ordered to hand over his past private correspondence with several former Trump he was sorting through his inbox Monday morning and determined that complying with the subpoena would be an intolerable hassle he said after all I have a life okay that is that is fully possible but there is a question to be asked okay let's assume that Santa nunberg is borderline nuts let's say that the guy is a kook which apparently he is what's the media's obligation not to put Kooks on TV what's the media's obligation not to put crazy people on TV because half the people in politics are totally crazy let's say that I had told you back in circle like 2012 that there was some guy who's wandering around saying things like the President of the United States was born in Kenya let's say that he was wandering around commenting on Robert Pattinson 'he's relationship with Kirsten Stewart let's say that he was wandering around saying weird things about reality TV and also weird things about politics and just sort of generally mouthing off and in somewhat crazy fashion would you put him on TV the answer's maybe put him on TV because now he's the president of the United States in other words we've had some pretty crazy people in politics for a while so well I'm ripping on the media I'm not sure that it's fully justified to rip on the media for putting this guy on TV I will say I'm not sure the treatment would have been the same if you're an Obama official versus being a trump official I also think that there's a difference between people like Jake Tapper or even our email we're putting him on TV and people like Karen Burnett if Erin Burnett actually thought that he was drunk if Erin Burnett actually thought that this that that Sam Nunn Berg was a loose cannon off his rocker then that is irresponsible journalism but it does raise the question of what kind of journalistic ethics the media have been using recently and the answer is not very good you have a lot of partisan hacks on both sides of the aisle or either willing to cover for the president or willing to slander the president with anything that they can get their hands on and if they think that Sam Nunn Berg is gonna come out of the woodwork and ramble on incessantly about crazy things they will put him on the air just for the sake of putting him on the air which is not a good look it's really not a good look for the media and it's and you know they should be a little bit more careful apparently who's booked for like the Today show this morning it's easy if you're Omarosa apparently yeah but look some of the responsibility here also falls on the Trump campaign they really have to stop hiring top men from the end of India and Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark right their top men are not top men and sam nunn Berg is just more proof of that okay so meanwhile in sexuality continues to make people on the left insanely stupid so overnight literally over a 24-hour period there were a bevy of anti right-wing disruptions on campus so christina hoff luck christina hoff sommers friend mine the factual feminist she's professor she was speaking about feminism and she was speaking about the the failures of the social justice warrior program and she was shouted down is it a law school okay so this is this was happening at Lewis and Clark law school which is one of the better schools in the country and a coalition of student groups had demanded that what they called known fascist christina hoff sommers be no platform meaning that they shouldn't allow her to speak and they put out the Portland National Lawyers Guild put out a statement saying we are proud of our student chapter for taking a concerted stand against fascist racist and misogynistic views being broadcasted on campus the National Lawyers Guild boos and Clarke choppers joined with the minority Law Students Association black Law Students Association women's law caucus immigration student group Jewish Law Society Latino Law Society outlaw and Lewis and Clark young Democratic Socialist of America to ask the Federalist Society rescind their invitation they did not they did not rescind the invitation and and christina hoff sommers showed up anyway I really like Christina she is a charming woman and not only is she charming she's also quite intelligence and had a quite intelligent that has a lot to say she is not a fascist okay there's no evidence that she's a fascist and the attempt to boil down fascism to anything I don't like is simply idiotic which is more fascist christina hoff sommers coming and speaking about the the lies of the feminist movement or the people who are suggesting that they should actually be able to shut down her lecture by use of force that seems a little more fascist to me so here's a little bit of the video when Christina started trying to start her lecture last night at Lewis and Clark law school okay nothing quite says bucking trends like repeating verbatim word-for-word what people are telling you to say nothing really says that you're thinking for yourself quite like repeating in North Korean fashion exactly what your dictator tells you to say pretty amazing I love that the woman who's walking around here with a jacket saying stay woke he's just standing at the front and shouting at people and then according Cristina what happened is that the diversity officer from the university came up to her and asked her to cut short her lecture and go directly to Q&A instead of finishing her lecture just absolute class shown by the university over at Lewis & Clark disgusting stuff but not a shock I remember they tried to do this to me over at University of Wisconsin if I were Christina I immediately would have done exactly what I did at University of Wisconsin she's got an entire white board behind her that gives her the ability to create some pretty fun visuals with the people who are standing right there I remember I wrote on the blackboard it was a rising blackboard at University of Wisconsin I wrote in very large letter idiots with a look with an arrow pointing to the people who are protesting and so that was in all the pictures which is kind of funny I would recommend it to Christina that she do that as well it's just it's asinine but that wasn't the only place that this was happening yesterday so my friend Jordan Peterson he was speaking over in over in Canada at I'm tremble which University this was and while he was be is Queen's University and while he was speaking people started banging on the windows trying to shatter the the windows at this church I'm is happening in Grant Hall I guess I'm not sure if it was a church if it's just a lecture hall and people started banging on the windows people attempting to stop the lecture they were followed by a bunch of violent people afterward here's a little bit of the video from Jordan Peterson's lecture again this is all happening in the same 48-hour period just demonstrating to you how intersectionality has made the left completely insane okay so well done for the college where is their security why is security not removing those people why security not preventing those people from disrupting what sure the answer is because security allows people to do all the sort of stuff because they don't want to be seen as repressive of the actual repressive forces it's the same reason I get shuttled to satellite campuses at University of Minnesota it's the reason they shot my lectures to the public at University of Connecticut and University of California Los Angeles and University of California Berkeley it's the reason why we have trouble at every campus because the administrators are too chicken bleep to actually stands up to the violent people okay and it's not just them it's not just that there was another case of this last night as well and I will tell you about that case and I'll tell you more about the intersectional failures of the left in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Indo Chino so nothing makes you look better than a custom-made suit nothing right you're going to instead a department store and you buy one of these things

incredible deal for a suit that's gonna fit you better than anything else you're gonna be able to get use that promo code Shapiro to make sure you get the $379 deal ok so it wasn't just Christina it wasn't just Jordan Peterson it was also Yaron Brook so yarn Brooke is an Objectivist meaning that he is a devotee of ein Rand I find his thought really interesting he and I disagree about about some things obviously because I'm not an Objectivist I think that Iran is great on economics and not great when it comes to extending her philosophy to personal relationships but in any case he was speaking at King's College I guess and he in in Britain and in antifoam AAB up and shut him down so here's what that looked like hey then violence breaks out one of the students who's doing the filming has attacked just wonderful stuff according to the examiner this is the London examiner I believe the violent protests also broke out around outside after around 200 students were turned away when King's College decided to prevent an eye on students from attending the event again King's College did exactly what so many colleges have done to me they've suggested that people should not be allowed to attend from the outside world students told the examiner they believe King's College turned a blind eye to the ante for members because they disagreed with the content of the speech but they couldn't legally prevent Yaron Brook and Sark on as sargon of akkad is kind of a YouTube figure from speaking on campus students who waited outside the auditorium became in mesh inner protests the school knew was coming and Antipa released smoke bombs and threw punches students were in the line of fire one student told the news organisation quote I feel strongly the university caved into the ante for protesters they need to protect speech and not prevent people from joining peacefully they changed criteria just 2.5 hours prior to the event despite it having been scheduled for months I'm very disappointed in an institution a top university in the world acting cowardly like this okay and but this has become obviously the thing the left does now why is the left so angry christina hoff sommers or jordan peterson or Yaron Brook and sargon of akkad why why are they so angry at these people well because all of these people violate the tenets of intersectionality intersectionality is the philosophy it's identity politics it's the philosophy that says your identity as a person is your group identity you're not an individual you are a group identity so you're a black guy you're not a person with individual viewpoints and if you're a black guy your viewpoint should be of left because otherwise you're not truly black if you're a Jewish person you must be of the left because as we all know Jews about Democrat and that means that if you're Jewish and you're not of the Democratic Left then you must not be a good representative of Judaism you must not be a good Jew and therefore we rip away your intersectional identity ok the foolishness of this obvious is pretty obvious and pretty astonishing but unfortunately it has infused the entire left it really has infused a large portion of the left identity politics predominating over meaningful discourse over meaningful discourse and it's not just these idiotic students these Antipa members attempting to shut down debate on college campuses the most obvious example it happened actually last night so my good friend Bethany Mandel who used to write over at comment a magazine she writes for the Federalists on occasion and Bethenny does a podcast as well so Bethenny had one of the worst childhood experiences ever right so Bethenny grew up dirt poor in a trailer park she heard her mom died she had to pull the plug on her mom when she was 16 her dad committed suicide when he was when she was 19 her dad was a drug addict apparently and all of this is to say that Bethenny's life story is not exactly a bed of roses she converted to Judaism and she married my friend Seth they have a bunch of kids really wonderful people she wrote a piece for the New York Times over the weekend I mean it came out Monday in which she talked about her experiences and why she owns a gun and the reason she says she owns a gun is because when she was growing up she was living with her mom her dad had already taken off and somebody legitimately they were living I guess an apartment on the second storey some robber putting a ladder to her window and attempted to climb it in her window right when she was a kid and her mom walked in with a gun that she had with a with a rifle that she had and pointed it at the window and said to Bethenny move aside or you're gonna get brains honey basically and when the guy showed up at the top of the window she said to him you better run or I'm gonna shoot you and that was the end of that and so Bethenny said as I got a lot of Bethenny had a lot of death threats in the last election cycle she was not Pro Trump and so she brought a gun in the aftermath of that well Shannon Watts is a is a gun control warrior Shannon watts is a radical gun control advocate and and she decided to attack Bethenny for being white she said that Bethenny suffered from white privilege so do we have some of those tweets this is 14 so Shannon Watts attacked Bethenny Mandel and and what she said was this New York Times paired this op-ed by a white woman based on her anecdotes for fear and paranoia instead of actual gun safety data with a photo of a woman of color how dare the New York Times suggest that women of color and women who are white might have common interests when it comes to having a gun we never mind that there's an actual picture of a woman shopping for a gun right there who's a woman of color apparently according to Shannon Watts that person doesn't exist but then she says that Beth all Bethenny is a white woman full of fear and paranoia not that she had a personal experience is somebody trying to break into her house or not that she received death threats Bethenny is just a typical white woman and if she really were not white and should understand the threat that guns pose and then it gets even worse right she actually tweeted out a bunch of nastiness about Bethany she suggested that Bethany was actually a racist right Shannon Watts actually suggested that Bethany was a racist from wanting to protect herself from neo-nazis which is just all class and again all this comes down to is that intersectional politics right all this comes down to is is a nasty intersectional politics because again you know the Bethany's story has nothing to do with her color but according to Shannon white that is Shannon Watts that is all that matters she says that the problem with America right now is that people are making gun laws based on emotion not data and Bethany replied I'm sorry you've been have you not been promoting the Parkland students emotions for the last two weeks or are we only allowed to base decisions on certain emotions and Shannon Watts suggested quote your privilege in feeling that a gun will make you safer is in part because you are white CVC data actually shows the opposite about gun ownership so Bethany says a guy tried to climb in my bedroom and kill me when I was a kid and my mother scared him off with the gun and Shannon Watson's reply was you only care about this because you are white and then Bethany said I took my mom off life support at sixteen and my father hang himself when I was 19 and grew up in a single-wide trailer in Northrop's trailer park in upstate New York besides that I've been truly hashtag blessed right Shannon wasp replied quote again your white skin makes you less likely to be at risk as a gun owner regardless of your hardscrabble background I guess you don't believe in racism okay so suddenly Bethany doesn't believe in racism because she's actually been threatened by a guy climbing in her window the intersectionality here is just astonishing intersectionality again making people stupid every single day and I'm gonna give you another example of intersectionality making people insane and

conservative podcast in the nation all righty so speaking of intersectionality making people insanely stupid so as I've been tracing over the course of the last few weeks Louis Farrakhan is one of the more disgusting characters in American public life he is the head of the Nation of Islam he's an open anti-semite he calls Jews satanic he suggests that white people are Devils he is the worst of the worst of the worst and a couple of the heads of the women March a women's March are big fans of his they have been defended in turn by Linda Sarsour who another anti-semite who has defended Louis Farrakhan or at least the people who defend Louis Farrakhan and people who are associated with the women's March could say ladies it's time to it's time to cast out Louis Farrakhan instead advocates of the women's March say our intersectionality makes US allies in other words yes I'm a Jew and I'm a member of the women's March but I'm not insulted by the fact that Louis Farrakhan is backed by top members of the women's March because we have common interests our common interest is in tearing down the patriarchy so I'm not gonna speak up I'm not gonna say anything about the nastiness inside my own movement now I hate this kind of stuff when it was identity politics of the right I said so I don't like tribalism tribalism on the right suggested that when the Trump campaign was making common cause with the all right I was totally okay because Hillary Clinton had to be taken down and I said no that's not okay it's not only counterproductive politically it's immoral you can't make light of the alt-right you can't pretend these are nice people you can't pretend that the actual anti-semites out there are people who ought to be brought into the fold because you share a common cause with them that's intersectionality identity politics of the right and it's gross I was one of the lead advocates on that score on the left however the same people who were saying that the alt-right was gross and Trump had to throw them off which is correct are now saying that the women's March is totally fine they have no problem with anti-semitism even though top leaders of the women's March are now obviously in league with open anti-semites there's an article over at the forward calm talking about this talking about this unfortunate tendency which has been largely ignored by the mainstream media by the way Jake Tapper CNN being lone exception so there's a woman named um named Sophie Elliman go on she's a passionate feminist she's a she runs communications for the women's March and now she has ripped into a couple of these members of the lemons Marsh I'm tired of our movements not taking anti-semitism seriously it's not okay it's taking a toll on me and on all Jewish people on the Left we are tired and heartbroken okay and but what's amazing is how people on the Left have responded to that what's amazing is how people on the Left have responded to the fact that Tameka Mallory who is a member of the women's March to top member the women's March has repeatedly praised and associated with Farrakhan participate in a rally with him last week at which he maligned two Jews as the spawn of Satan she's a former executive director of Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network al Sharpton again another notorious anti-semite who's again featured in mainstream media on a repeat basis Farrakhan is leading anti-semite in the United States he's claimed that Adolf Hitler was a very great man it's not just Tameka Mallory there was another woman who was associated with the women's March who was involved he talked about this in the last couple of days so they went and asked over at former calm a bunch of intersectional leaders on the Left who were Jews about this he can see how identity politics Trump's everything but identity politics doesn't actually mean standing up for your identity as a Jew it means standing up for the idea that you are a member of a dispossessed class so here's one of the funny things about being a member of an identity group being a member of an identity group doesn't mean that there's any spent anything special about your identity group the only thing about your identity group that matters in identity politics is that it is anti the quote unquote establishment is that it seeks to tear down the hierarchy that it seeks to break apart the status quo so it doesn't matter that there are differences between black folks and Jews on politics it doesn't matter there's a difference between Muslims and Jews certainly on politics so long as they all claim common cause and tearing down the structure they're all members of the same group so this is why people are constantly asking the question why is it that folks on the Left seem so tolerant of radical Muslims when radical Muslims are totally anti-gay they're totally anti women's rights they're totally anti liberalism why is it that so many members left like you'll see LGBT groups match a marching arm and arm with people who support Hamas why is that why is that and the answer is because as member of identity groups they don't actually have solidarity within identity groups against other identity groups the purpose of the identity group is to band together in this great cohesive unit of the so-called dispossessed to fight against the broader spectrum so radical Muslims don't have anything in common with the LGBT crowd but they do have common cause in tearing down what they see as America's terrible terrible superstructure of racism and oppression and so they will overlook the evils of the other in orders that they can tear down their allies of convenience and allies of identity that's the that's the idea here so Jill Jacobs who's just gross she's executive director of true there have been a call for Human Rights rabbi Jill Jacobs who knows less about Judaism than my four-year-old daughter she says well Louis Farrakhan said is disgusting inexcusable I don't think one can dismiss the entire movement and certainly not the entire progressive world because of a statement by one person or two people they imagine that this were said about David Zook in the all right let's say that there are a bunch of members of the alt-right associated with David Duke which they have and let's say that somebody said listen David Duke is just deplorable he's disgusting he's awful but I really had to slander the entire alright because David Duke are you really gonna do that and the answer is yeah kinda I mean if you tolerate this stuff then you become a party to it Judy levy is executive director of the Jewish Council on urban affairs and she made excuses for it as well she said people don't always express themselves on every single issue in ways that we would that we would be comfortable but it's really important that when we share values who work together to raise up the urgent issues that we all face and there it is in a nutshell identity politics is about the common cause it is not about actually standing up for your identity group even as Sharon brous who spoke at the 2017 women's March she is at least attempting to do something where she said there's no room in a multi-faith multi-ethnic coalitional movement for anti-semitism homophobia or transphobia in a big tent movement there has to be room for disagreement but certain core values must stand at the forefront yeah except that these women are not going to be tossed out Linda Sarsour is still being cheered and Linda Sarsour by the way is not only being cheered inside the women's March when the Sarsour is being cheered over at UConn so it turns out that she's supposed to speak at University of Connecticut and when she speaks the University of Connecticut she is she is not going to have to have tremendous security nor are the students being offered preliminary counseling so you'll recall then when I spoke at University of Connecticut the general public was barred you'll also recall that the administration sends out a full letter to the student body suggesting that if they need a preliminary counseling because I was gonna say something so terrible that that would be available Linda Sarsour has his iana scan not be feminist Linda Sarsour has repeatedly supported terrorists when the Sarsour is one the worst people in American politics she is a radical and yet she is being treated as royalty at UConn well I was treated as basically a David Duke type which is precisely the opposite of the truth when it comes to me versus Linda Sarsour so pretty amazing but again all that matters is the identity politics and it's infused the entire Democratic Party it's one of the reasons that are looking at candidates like Kamala Harris it's the reason that are looking at Cory Booker it's the reason that are looking at hooli and Castro as opposed to looking at you o Biden the good news for Republicans is that the more the Democrats engage in this broader identity politics movement the more they engage in intersectional intersectionality which was mentioned by the way at the Oscars by Ashley Judd talk about intersectionality the more the Left tries to suggest that they are a coalition of the dispossessed fighting the the great power structure the more Americans think I don't want any part of these people I don't want anything to do with these people the left is alienating more people with high-density politics then it's drawing it now they're banking on the idea that the changing demographics of the United States are going to create an intersectional majority coalition but I don't think that's the case because again I think people are individuals not members of identity groups and I think people will turn away if they're treated as individuals from the stupidity and malice of the intersectional movement alright so in other news I wanted to I wanted to point today is normally a day when we would do deconstructing the culture but instead of doing deconstructing the culture at the end of the show I want to point out a bit of a controversy over the bachelor so the I mentioned the other day a very funny show called the good place and sound Network TV I think you can also get it on Netflix I don't even know a channel the time because I cut the cord a long time ago but the good place has a joke in it where they're talking about people who get into heaven and the people who get into heaven are apparently the people who do not watch The Bachelor like this is one of the actual criterias that if you watch The Bachelor you have emotional investment in The Bachelor it makes you a bad person well I think that that's probably true so ABC I'm sure that would good people who watch The Bachelor but they are wasting their time and their life force so last night on The Bachelor you wonder why our country got so stupid you wonder why our country has turned into an emotional basket case maybe it's because we watch reality TV and we think it's actual reality and then we invest obviously fictionalized stories with the power of true human emotions so The Bachelor apparel I hadn't watched one minute of the bachelor of the season so forgive me if I slightly botched the story apparently the bachelor had picked one woman as the woman who was going to marry and then it turns out that he divorced her and he didn't divorce her he broke up with her after they were engaged and got together with the second place finisher know what I would say about the second place finisher is have you no pride woman have you no gumption if a guy throws you over for another girl and then he leaves that other girl back for you have you no sense of self-worth that you would go with that guy but here's what it looked like on The Bachelor and of course this is exploitative television in every way these people signed up for it so it's hard to feel terrible for them but it really is kind of yucky that so many people find meaning in what is obviously stagecraft to more humans for yourself if you want me just to go go was it truly the most shocking finale in bachelor history in a three-hour special episode Monday night viewers saw our elion Dyke jr. break up with Lauren Byrne opposed to Becca kufran I choose you today but I choose you every day from here on out only to dump kufran in a raw painful unedited scene you said me he told her he wanted to try again with Lauren and his help the further along we got the further I started drifting away from the possibility of trying it again with her relationship and this may only be the start of the Fallout franchise favorite Becca Martinez revealed Monday night that the 36 year old had been sending her a few private messages they seemed harmless until that is messaging super duper classy SuperDuper classy and then all of America gets invested in this kind of tawdry nonsense who wonder why with reality TV star ended up being president okay just a little bit of data for those of you who are fans of The Bachelor in 20 seasons of The Bachelor 12 men have actually popped the question on air however of those 20 of those 20 seasons two of the couples are still together one is married okay that is a worse ratio than people who are going down to the bar getting drunk and hitting on people that is an awful awful ratio case it's a little bit better on the Bachelorette apparently the Bachelorette I guess that they've had a couple of successes so Season seven they had a success Season nine they had a success and Season eleven in season 12 I guess people are still together but it's not it's like 50% so the the notion that any of this is real is just absurd of course it's not real but when we get caught up in investing our emotions in reality TV which is all being produced behind the scenes but my mama is a reality TV producer okay my mom has done this stuff I've watched for all footage of reality TV shows before it is nothing like what appears on television they can make virtually anything appear interesting and fascinating reality TV is not but it just demonstrates once and for all that there are a lot of people who are who are finding value in in relationship stuff that has nothing do with relationship so I was asked a question recently that at a college I think is at University of Minnesota about whether a leftist should date a conservative now what I said is if you're dating for marriage which is supposedly what the bachelor or the Bachelorette are about if you're dating for those things the first thing you should be talking about is values has there ever been an episode of the bachelor or the Bachelorette where people actually talked about values or they actually talked about what they wanted their lives to look like or is it more just will jet set off to the most romantic location and then we will hang out together until we fall in love and when we're really sexy outfits and go in the jacuzzi together okay again all of this is really dumb none of it is built for relationships but this is what relationships week on and then we're surprised when people imitate what they see on TV and ignore values and relationships no wonder people are not sticking together they're not sticking together because we have a stupid idea of how adult relationships are supposed to work largely promulgated by the media okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like since we did the the good place yesterday I figured we'll do some heaven themed stuff this week so underrated movie what dreams may come with Robyn ones the visuals in this movie are really what make it interesting Robyn well anytime you watching Robin Williams movies really sad watch Robin Miller Williams movies now obviously because what happened to him but it's what do you do himself but it's um the movie is is quite moving and I think that it works Max von Sydow is in it here's a little bit of the trailer the moment that comes for everyone has come for Chris Nielsen you died Chris if Heaven is a place where you know only joy screwed up I'm in dog heaven you're creating an entire world here from your imagination from anything you want where you feel no more fear I'm gonna drop can't you're already dead and anything you can imagine is real could you let go you left behind the movie is the movie is actually quite moving and it really works one of the things about Robin Williams as an actor as you can see the demand was a truly troubled individual and you can always see there's a sort of pain behind his eyes and in this movie it really works for him so check out what dreams may come worth while watching okay other things that I like Nikki Haley my spirit animal at the UN that's issues speaking at AIPAC yesterday and she talked about Israel and the United Nations the United Nations of course is the most Eisley of actual life I here is Nikki hailey talking about the UN at the UN and throughout the UN agencies Israel does get bullied it gets bullied because the countries that don't like Israel are used to being able to get away with it well just like when I was that little girl in South Carolina that just doesn't sit well with me Jerusalem is the capital of Israel that's a fact and President Trump had the courage to recognize that fact when others would not the United Nations spends half of its time attacking only one country we will not accept it any longer yeah good for nikki Haley this is one of the best things about the Trump administration it's one area where they bucked foreign policy conventional wisdom and they've done really well with it okay time for some things that I hate okay so apparently the the hatred of guns is so strong now that the dating app bumble has announced that it will ban profile photos with guns in them in response to the shooting at Parkland a statement on the bumble website said the company will now moderate all photos for the presence of guns excluding users who are in military or law enforcement uniforms in their photos so if you are a gun packing woman then you cannot be on bumble with that picture they also announced they would donate a hundred thousand dollars to the March for our lives that anti gun violence at March organized by the survivors of the Parkland shooting again is any of that worthwhile is any of that going to stop violence with guns of course not it's all virtues signaling but so much of corporate culture has now become virtue signaling that it's it's actually really troubling it's one of the reasons by the way that you are seeing a change in the actual way that news is done the way that the news industry is done so if you look at Facebook Facebook is now changing its algorithm YouTube has been changing you say algorithm they're downgrading anything that has mild controversial contents they're attempting to weed out stuff that gets people excited or gets people irritated or confronts them with news they don't want to see because advertisers are getting blowback from people on the supposedly or at least advertisers don't want to be associated with controversial opinions okay the reason this is a real problem is because what this does is it actually ensures that people are going to go to their own bubbles because the way that the model works on places like Facebook or YouTube is their ad supported models so you know if you get our show on YouTube for example then YouTube may play an ad beforehand or then ad monetize one of our videos they may take the ads off beforehand well if they do that to people who are totally reliant on ad support if they that's a dave rubin for example then that forces people to give money to rubin to subscribe to reuben in order to get that content and what that means is that dave Reubens crowd of people from whom he is drawing money is going to be smaller than normally would be so at ARS B so it's even Crowder's B so with Joe Rogan's B anybody who gets D monetized on a regular basis is going to have to rely on a subscription model subscription models are by nature opt-in models that means that people who are not familiar with the contents are not going to subscribe and that means that if you're familiar with the New York Times you're never gonna see an opposing viewpoint if you're familiar with daily wire you're never going to see an opposing viewpoint it actually ensures that the bubbles are strengthened so corporate weakness in these areas is really bad for the country and it's one of the reasons why Media Matters has done such awful work in trying to go after advertisers simply for advertising on sites that carry messages the demand that they may not like I think it's a really dangerous business in the in which they are engaging okay other things that I that I hate so worthwhile noting the West Virginia teachers strike is apparently still continuing that they were talking about settling it this morning I'm not sure if they have finally settled it or not it's in its second week this strike is illegal so basically a bunch of teachers in West Virginia are striking against the state of West Virginia in order to get higher pay I don't like public sector unions because they're striking against the taxpayer this is why public sector unions should be illegal it should not be legal for people to strike against the taxpayer can you imagine the cops striking against the taxpayer just not gonna do our job were just gonna walk off okay they did the state should have to pay whatever it is that people are willing to take but this is why unions that actually get together and band together and then have people walk out in order to deprive the taxpayers of services that we are owed for the tax money that we are paying are really really bad now do I blame the teachers who are members of the unions no but I do blame the but I do blame the Union itself and the state for engaging in this in this sort of negotiation they should have filed a legal case an injunction against the Union on on this and they should have gone back to what West Virginia's law is which is right-to-work they should have just gone to individual teachers and hired the individual teachers back at prices that they are willing to pay and prices that the teachers are willing to work for okay we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest i'm ben
