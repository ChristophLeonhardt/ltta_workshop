say before we had a little meet up with
David Schwimmer our new best friend oh
I'm dripping this all over the place is
as I was eating this I was like pop this
tastes not like ice cream she was like
it's meant to taste like the cereal on
the bottom of your bowl when you finish
you know the milk at the bottom of the
bowl many bacteria when you for that
little bit of milk after like almost

well we need to go and I need to put my
friends t-shirt on for the occasion and
Carrie Bradshaw's front door although
I'm very mindful that there are actual
people living in it so I don't want to
be like one of those annoying people
