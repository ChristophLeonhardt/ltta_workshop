an epic victory celebrated in the Museum of London 100 years since the first British women got the vote all thanks to the suffragettes who took on the establishment and one it wasn't easy they chained themselves to fences outside Parliament many were arrested beaten went on hunger strike one even threw herself at the Kings horse in the famous Derby race she died but the cause did not the suffragettes struggled but they ultimately won but what would they make a British society today 100 years on would they believe that women have achieved true equality it wasn't until 1928 that younger and poorer women were also given the vote and says this vary in character actor the suffragettes always hoped to inspire future generations you know we're gonna have to keep fighting I'm sure and I just hope that we can set the precedent for that and that there you know keep fighting just as hard as we're she no doubt would agree Emmeline Pankhurst leader of the suffragettes and great-grandmother of Helen who wonders if the glass is only half-full in every single measure of political equality we still have so far to go in every single Parliament and in particular in the UK we only have 32 percent representation if you look at all other aspects of democracy so the legal system the the media reporting of Parliament's and of politics we still have a lot to go comedy throws light on women's struggles today but it also made it a feminist week it's the first week in our relationship that I have earned him with British institutions from Parliament to the BBC hit by revelations of gender discrimination it feels like we're just failing over and over but we have to remember the suffragettes failed for over 50 years they only succeeded once and we only need to succeed once they're impossible is our normal life and we are the hopes of the suffragettes our debt to the heroines of the past maligned in their day as misguided radicals we remember them as being on the right side of history Barnaby Phillips al-jazeera London
