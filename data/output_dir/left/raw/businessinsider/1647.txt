00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
um what<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made about the news</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,380
about Obamacare in recent weeks with

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,240
insurers pulling out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of exchanges in</font>

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,250
states how troubled is the Affordable

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,969
Care it's trouble I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real</font>

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,469
the way I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is Obamacare was</font>

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,320
put together it is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,000
a Rube Goldberg device I've always said

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,600
that it's an attempt to simulate a

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,070
single-payer system without single-payer

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,160
by through a combination of regulations

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,260
subsidies and so on which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font>

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,640
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> other countries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have made it</font>

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,470
work parts of the US system are here

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,820
where California seems to be doing fine

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,460
but it was done we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to say it was</font>

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,469
done kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of on the cheap for political</font>

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,300
reasons all of the pieces are leader

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,230
under strength or<font color="#E5E5E5"> underfunded the the</font>

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,379
individual mandate is not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong as</font>

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,629
it should be so sick people you know

22
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,480
healthy people still find it too easy to

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,000
wait until they get sick the subsidies

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,920
for consumers are little underfunded the

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,890
outreach efforts are underfunded so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

26
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">sits low threadbare and we're possibly</font>

27
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,500
seeing it start to unravel at least in

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,360
not in all of the country but in parts

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country so this is of course it</font>

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,470
would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a whole lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of money a</font>

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,869
whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort to fix except almost</font>

32
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly the fixes would require</font>

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,770
legislation and then we talk about

34
00:01:16,770 --> 00:00:00,000
divided government
