00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,879
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this steph curry</font>

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,730
shoe is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to him he loves</font>

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,570
white shoes so we made him a white shoe

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,040
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people ask him about it you</font>

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">know he says it's hot</font>

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,660
so we always you know engage in an

7
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,580
iterative process<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all of our</font>

8
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">athletes and part of that is getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

9
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,440
know them getting to know you know their

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,390
unmet needs and the product that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

11
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,280
have but also getting a sense for their

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,250
own personal style and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has always been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case with steph</font>

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,360
is he loves white shoes right and so

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,880
last year we made<font color="#E5E5E5"> him a white shoe that</font>

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,530
had a little bit of chrome on it and I

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we always try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,369
is give that athlete something that you

19
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,710
can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel connected to and that's</font>

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,000
our goal and that's our mission that's

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we always try and do and so I think</font>

22
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's one of those things where when you</font>

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,180
make product and you allow your

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,310
designers to listen to the athlete you

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,710
allow them to to basically swing for the

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,630
fence hopefully you're going to make

27
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,000
some product that some people love and

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,100
some people hate and that's just the way
