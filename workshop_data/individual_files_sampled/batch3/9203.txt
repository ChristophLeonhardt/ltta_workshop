THE FACT IS SANCTUARY COUNTIES ARE NOT MORE VIOLENT, MORE DANGEROUS. QUITE THE CONTRARY. THE WALL IS A MONUMENT TO STUPIDITY. WHILE IT IS INTENDED TO THIS COUNTRY. Shannon: CALIFORNIA'S FIRST AND ONLY GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE TOOK PLACE TODAY. REPUBLICAN JOHN COX GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH DEMOCRATIC DARLING GAVIN NEWSOM. DID HE GET A FAIR SHAKE? LET'S ASK HIM. JOHN COX IS HERE. WE HAVE INVITED GAVIN NEWSOM NUMEROUS TIMES, HIS DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT. WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK. JOHN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HOW DID YOU FEEL THE DEBATE WENT? IT WAS CALLED A CONVERSATION AND I CALLED IT THE NONCONVERSATION CONVERSATION. WE GOT ASKED A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS. WE OBVIOUSLY TALKED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND THE COST OF LIVING, THE COST OF HOUSING, THE COST OF GASOLINE AND THE GAS TAX. WE HAD A WHOLE HUGE DISCUSSION ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE AND GUNS, NEITHER OF WHICH I AM RUNNING ON. NEITHER OF WHICH IS MUCH IN CONTROVERSY. WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WATER WHICH IS A HUGE ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA. MR. NEWSOM IS IN FAVOR OF RATIONING. THE LEGISLATURE JUST ENACTED RATIONING. OUR FARMERS OUT HERE, WE ARE THE SALE OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY. OUR FARMERS ARE BEING STARVED OF WATER. WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT EDUCATION. EDUCATION IS A KEY ISSUE BECAUSE WE HAVE GONE FROM BEING ONE OF THE TOP STATES IN THE NATION IN EDUCATION TO WHERE WE ARE NOW 47TH IN PROVISION C. MR. NEWSOM IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TEACHERS UNIONS AND WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT IT. Shannon: "THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE" SAID TIME AND AGAIN, JOHN COX FOUND HIMSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE WHEN NEWSOM CHALLENGE CHALLENGED. COX EXHIBITED A BIT OF FRUSTRATION WHEN NEWSOM BROUGHT UP CONCEALED WEAPONS AND OTHER GUN-CONTROL ISSUES. THEIR HEADLINE WAS "GAVIN NEWSOM THE CLEAR WINNER." I TALKED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. THE REAL IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT DO THE VOTERS CARE ABOUT? WE HAVE VOTERS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO CAN'T AFFORD RENT, CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR GASOLINE. THEY CAN'T AFFORD FOOD. ELECTRICITY RATES ARE TWICE WHAT TEXAS PAYS. OUR SCHOOLS ARE AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE. THEY ARE FAILING. OUR ROADS ARE CONGESTED. MEANWHILE, WE HAVE GAVIN NEWSOM IN FAVOR OF A TRAIN THAT IS WAY OVER BUDGET, WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE AND IS SOAKING UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT COULD BE SPENT BUILDING ROADS AND OUTFITTING OUR FIREFIGHTERS. WE HAVE GOT A REAL DISGRACE OF MANAGEMENT IN SACRAMENTO. MR. NEWSOM WILL ONLY DOUBLE DOWN ON TAXES AND A ROTTEN BUSINESS ECONOMY. HE WILL MAKE THIS WORSE THAN IT IS. Shannon: WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF STORIES OF THE TROUBLES FACING CALIFORNIA. POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS, ALL KINDS OF THINGS. CALIFORNIA VOTERS CONSISTENTLY CONTINUE TO VOTE AND PRIMARILY SEND DEMOCRATS TO SACRAMENTO AND TO OVERSEE THINGS IN THE STATE CAPITAL. YOU HAVE AN UPHILL BATTLE. IT'S GOING TO CHANGE. YOU MENTIONED THE HOMELESSNESS. I WAS IN SAN FRANCISCO TODAY AND GAVIN NEWSOM WAS THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO AND IT'S REALLY A SAD SITUATION. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES OF THE WORLD. NOW IT'S THE NATIONWIDE LEADER IN PROPERTY CRIMES. YOU CAN'T EVEN RIDE THE BART. THE STREETS ARE FULL OF HUMAN WASTE AND HYPODERMIC NEEDLES. AND REALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST LIVING ON THE STREETS STRUNG OUT ON DRUGS AND MR. NEWSOM'S ANSWER IS TO GIVE PEOPLE CLEAN NEEDLES AND AN INJECTION CENTER. I THINK WE NEED TO TREAT THESE ILLNESSES. WE NEED TO TREAT MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE ABUSE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND THAT'S THE COMPASSIONATE THING TO DO. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REJECT GAVIN NEWSOM SO CALLED SOLUTIONS THE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM. THEY WANT A CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY WANT A STATE THEY CAN BE PROUD OF AND I THINK THEY WILL HAVE THAT STATE WHEN I'M THE GOVERNOR. Shannon: YOU HAVE DEFIED EXPECTATIONS BY ENDING UP IN THE SO-CALLED JUNGLE PRIMARY.
