last week multiple news organizations reported that North Korea was continuing with its nuclear program which of course goes against the agreement that Kim Jong moon had signed with Donald Trump in regard to denuclearizing well today turns out that Trump has given an interview with Fox Business on the issue of North Korea and he's walking back some of his statements about what North Korea would do for him without further ado let's listen to what he had to say I've spoken with some military men of my own and they told us that told me that North Korea needs to tell us exactly where their facilities are so that we can inspect them in the next couple of weeks we don't find out in the next couple of weeks because they're not serious about this what are you going to do oh I think they're very serious about it I think they want to do we had a very good chemistry you know we had a lot of points we weren't a lot of different points I'd have to go over I got along really well with Chairman Kim we had a great chemistry we really had chairman but do we believe in mr. president I made a deal with him I shook hands with him I really believe he means it no okay is it possible have I been in deals have you been in things where people didn't work out it's possible okay I just have to make one quick point that doesn't have to do with what Trump said it has to do everything with what Maria Bartiromo said she spoke to military men who said that we need to know exactly where the nuclear with yeah yeah you did you have to speak to nuclear I mean did you have to talk to military men to know that it's just so incredibly frustrating we have clowns you know taking over in the media asking bigger clowns what they're gonna do about foreign policy anyway go ahead Jake so two parts of that one let me just build off what you're saying it's not looking any rational person would ask how do you verify the deal you don't need to go to military man as an appointed up but what does she mean by military men she's talking to other right-wingers she's massive right-wing she's about as right-wing as anyone on television maria bartiromo so she's talking to neoconservatives who still want war and they're saying Europe's I know the idiot thought he had good chemistry with Kim jong-un but we still want war so if you have Trump on why don't you ask him hey how we're gonna verify because he can't verify that'll expose that it's a bad deal it's a terrible deal maybe that'll lead us to war so it's like a parade of monsters pick'em okay trump's not on the right side but neither are the military men maria bartiromo is talking to now you get to trump we had good chemistry oh my god really right-wing this is what you're proud of well I mean I talked to him I liked it when I talked to somebody that dumb that like like if you go to any deal a business deal a foreign policy deal and go ahead and that other guy says oh yes sure sure I like you here give me what I want and and just trust me and goes what I like him though we had a good we had a good chemistry and instead of verifying to make sure that it's a good deal you just relied on do I like him or do I not like him how stupid are you and he brags about he's so stupid he doesn't understand that he's stupid like he says that on national television as if like what do you mean no I had good chemistry with him it's just so frustrating and he ended that video by the way if you paid close attention with maybe it won't work so remember after the summit in Singapore Trump was saying we don't need to worry about North Korea any more nuclear denuclearizing that's what's happening everybody give me the Nobel Peace Prize I'll give you his tweet okay his exact wording he says just landed a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office there is no longer nuclear threat from North Korea meeting with Kim jong-un was an interesting and very positive experience north Korea has great potential for the future now for anyone who's furiously typing comments on what we're talking about right now accusing us of not being in favor of diplomacy we are in favor of diplomacy but we also want someone who's competent to negotiate this deal and Trump is clearly not confident he's already screwing this up considerably I mean North Korea just continued you know enriching their nuclear program why wouldn't they I mean what did Trump do really do to push for a true agreement with real with a real timetable and and real verification so let's take it Democrats is an example if John Kerry who while he was trying to broker a peace deal in the Middle East with two in Israel and the Palestinians had walked away or Barack Obama the president say I've had to walked away from the first meeting I said okay great we have peace in the Middle East it's solved I'd be like what after the first meeting you don't even have a deal in place well what's the contours of the deal what did you negotiate I mean that's a bold statement to me that's a preposterous statement to make without a final deal in place and even if you had a deal it then discourages the other side from following through because you already publicly said that you got everything you wanted so they say oh great now he's on the hook in fact now reporting coming in saying that the North Koreans felt emboldened afterwards because since Trump made such a spectacle about how he'd solved the problem he'd be deeply embarrassed to admit he hadn't so we can actually go forward with our nuclear plans because Trump will have almost and especially given how obsessed he is with his own image will have tremendous difficulty walking back those statements well look I mean I think that there was a miscalculation on North Korea's part Trump has no problem ever you know just walking back what he says or contradicting himself from one day to the next right I mean he just did it in that interview so if they think that Trump has the ability to feel shame or embarrassment they're wrong about that their abs you're absolutely right about that they terribly miscalculated look and it's and it's very likely that they would have continued their nuclear program under any and all circumstances that is why it was so important when we said at the time we want a peace deal we like that Trump is meeting with him but you have to verify if you don't get verification out of it you've got nothing then all the gain is you know basically geared toward North Korea and the u.s. loses and the u.s. loses because Trump did give more to kim jeong-hoon than we got in return and i'll explain why in just a second but i want to show you the second part of this interview that I thought was extremely relevant take a look what did I do really when you think of it I went there so the papers say he went oh meaning I went to Singapore so we had a meeting we didn't do anything okay so what did he do there he actually did do quite a bit here's what he did take a look there he is very talented anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age really he's got a great personality he's a you know funny guy he's a very smart guy so he's a very smart guy he's a great negotiator he loves his people not that I'm surprised by that very few people at that age you can take one out of 10,000 probably couldn't do it I think he liked me and I liked him and I understand the past but he still some done some really bad things yeah but so have a lot of other people then some really bad things we had a great chemistry you understand how I feel about chemistry he's the head of a country and I mean he's the strong head don't let anyone think anything different he speaks and his people sit up at attention I want my people to do this my lifetime I've done a lot of deals with a lot of people and sometimes the people that you most distrust turn out to be the most honorable one so what did he get he got a US president to go around on a tour talking about how fantastic Kim jong-un is maybe that doesn't bother some of you but it bothers me and what he also got was a confession from Trump indicating that joint nuclear nuclear joint military exercises with our ally is provocative okay so whether or not Trump is really gonna end those military exercises I mean I don't know who can believe anything he says we never know what we're gonna get with this guy but what North Korea did get was a US president talking about how fantastic North Korea's dictator is well the one part that he was accurate about apparently is at least visa Vee Trump is said he's a great negotiator well he got nothing but wins out of you maybe that's incredibly easy and it's a low bar to clear but get the triple win then North Korea gets one Trump declares to the whole world that North Korea is not pursuing nuclear weapons anymore - may not only get a meeting which they were dying yet with any US president which I'm in favor of I don't care about the optics of that right but not only they get the meeting they have the US president doing propaganda on there be all across the world and look you I want to meet and do a deal with kim jeong-hoon because you don't get to negotiate with your friends you and you go she ate with your enemies but understand he is our enemy that guy runs concentration camps he that regime has caused the deaths of millions of people and the great great suffering and imprisonment of tens of millions of people for a decade after decade it is one of the worst regimes that we have ever seen and oh he's a great guy he's so smart he's so smart only one out of 10,000 can just get a country handed to him by their dad I see anyone can ha how do you look at that all those videos and think oh no Trump's really smart if you do I got to stop talking to you like trying to convince you if you haven't seen the videos and you haven't seen all this okay we can have a conversation but if you look at that and go that guy's smart there's no talking to you because you're just as dumb as he is and when finally point number three is north degree is like we get him to do this propaganda for us he says we've not doing nuclear weapons anymore and we can continue our nuclear program because there's no verification it's the greatest steel in the world for North Korea and the worst deal for us we're not gonna say for the millionth time we want a deal we don't want to go to war we're not neoconservatives we want peace but we want a deal not as not a giveaway where we get nothing in return because that's not gonna lead to war anyway and so now the neoconservatives get to be empowered and go up see they did it again North Korea violated the other one no deal cuz your idiot president walked away with nothing so now the John Bolton's of the world are all over TV and he was on Sunday going he's not saying I told you so cuz that'll get him fired by Trump but he is in a way that Trump is too stupid to understand going well now it is time for maybe a different course of action for North Korea so anyone who wanted peace you're gonna get a huge loss out of the Trump administration that's what we're afraid of and we got nothing out of that deal and now it is absolutely confirmed even with Trump going well mate maybe we don't have a deal two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit
