for the last few weeks the pro-trump media has been all but crowning Donald Trump the greatest diplomat in American history because he had scheduled a summit meeting with the North Koreans in fact a group of 18 House Republicans sent a letter calling for Trump to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and Trump himself told reporters that quote everyone thinks he deserves to win it at an April rally Michigan Trump luxuriated in Nobel chants from his most hardcore supporters that's very nice thank you that's very nice no bail go on white house even as we mentioned minted that special coin to mark the summit featuring Trump and as the coin respectfully called him supreme leader Kim jong-un yeah while all of this was happening there were plenty of people asking well why are we taking Donald Trump's Korea diplomacy seriously Trump had accepted the offer of a summit on the spot seemingly without much thought and reportedly didn't think he needed too much prepare for the meeting and despite images of Kim and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo grinning like old friends the two sides held deeply divergent and one might even say incompatible positions and they were only digging in as the June 12th summit date approached which brings us to today's inevitable in retrospect conclusion to the latest chapter in the reality-show presidency I've decided to terminate the plan summit in Singapore on June 12th breakdown of this summit raised the risk of war with North Korea well we'll see what happens we'll see what happens who knows NBC News is reporting tonight that hawkish National Security John Bolton advisor John Bolton pressured Trump to walk away that the president was worried Kim might cancel and wanted to cancel it before the North Korean leader could Trump first announced the decision in a letter that he personally dictated at least that's what White House sources say which you could believe because it alternated in tone between aggressive and wounded in which Pompeo was humiliatingly forced to read in the Senate hearing you talk about your nuclear capabilities but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used if you change your mind having to do with this important summit please do not hesitate to call me or write Trump's move took the world very much by surprise to build momentum for the summit North Korea which has it still wants to talk despite Trump's decision said it just destroyed a nuclear test site in front of foreign journalists who then found themselves upon Trump's announcement inside a country known to use foreign hostages as bargaining chips the decision is already precipitating a crisis for South Korean president moon jae-in who has staked his politics on this summit and could inflame tensions with Chinese President Xi Jinping who Trump blamed for screwing up the deal and all this for what exactly we're right back to where we were when Trump was taunting Kim as little rock a man though three Americans have come home and also threatening him with quote fire and fury that Nobel Prize is most definitely on hold I've spoken to general mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and our military which is by far the most powerful anywhere in the world that has been greatly enhanced recently as you all know is ready if necessary joining me now to discuss the cancellation the summit Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator where does today's cancellation leave us well it leaves us with a failure it leaves us with a lost opportunity but it doesn't leave us without some hope that these negotiations might be restarted a lot will depend upon Donald Trump and his team but we should now hope that we have additional new sustained engagement that we look at the sanctions regime and toughen them wherever necessary that we deepen our relationships with South Korea and Japan they weren't even notified this morning that the president was going to pull out of the deal but there still is some reason to be hopeful that we could get to the table we could begin this negotiation do you know something I don't know when you say there's reason to be hopeful well we don't have any other options we have to be hopeful what you're describing the steps you're taking are so the sort of basic blocking and Taplin tackling of international diplomacy one wouldn't have expected to have been already done it's still going to be this president and his people going forward what hope is there that they change the way they go about doing this well I agree with you Chris I I don't have any way of getting inside the internal workings of the Cerebral mechanisms of John Bolton or Donald Trump my hope is that however is that they may have learned a lesson here that you can't be using the qaddafi model you can't be using the Lybia model because at the end of that Qaddafi dies and at the end of it if you're going to use it as an analogy Kym dies so maybe you know just maybe the shop administration now now will try to tamper down some of this crazy rhetoric that was being used and maybe in turn Kim will do the same thing there's no guarantee that that's the case but ultimately there is no military solution to this problem even though President Trump alluded to it once again in our powerful nuclear arsenal that we could use I want to play both john bolton and vice president Mike Pence talking about the quote Libya option take a listen I think we're looking at the Libya model of 2003-2004 this will only end like the Libya model ended if Kim jong-un doesn't make a deal there are people who think they were intentionally both those gentlemen opposed the summit opposed to talks and trying to sabotage them by invoking that well you know there were many people inside of the Reagan administration who did not like the idea of him going to the summit with Gorbachev and they just wanted to see a continuation of the arms race so yeah it's clear that there are voices and John Bolton's at the front of that line who do not believe in a negotiated resolution of this issue the president it's ultimately going have to decide if he wants to try to pursue his quote-unquote Nobel Prize and the only way he's going to be able to accomplish that goal is if he goes to the negotiating table but he has to do so in a way that doesn't allow for his subordinates to be engaging in reckless charges against the North Korean regime or using analogies that actually would jeopardize the very survival of Kim if an agreement was reached that is just going to be counterproductive and will lead to an escalation of tensions rather than a reconciliation that is each between our country and North Korea you mentioned Japan and South Korea neither being notified we have news reports that it took them entirely by surprise to very close allies obviously South Korea the most important here they share the peninsula North Korea what what is the message to American allies across both Asia Europe and around the world in the wake of the Iran deal being scrapped unilaterally and now this summit being canceled without consultation well unfortunately it is in America first or I guess more precisely a Trump first foreign policy but ultimately that's counterproductive we can't really be successful in the Middle East without our allies we can't be successful on the Korean Peninsula without our allies it's in the one and the one hand naive and on the other hand reckless it's just not a complete understanding of how diplomacy has to work and I will cast it has to be accompanied with tough economic sanctions with all of our allies all joining in that including China by the way but there's a certain naivete in the president if he thinks this is a real estate deal Kim is not negotiating of initio here his his father negotiated on these same issues his grandfather negotiated on these same issues this is a family playbook and the president should learn the family playbook because they've been doing this for a long time and if the president thinks that he's just gonna come in make an assertion demand a response and get it he is absolutely as naive a negotiator on international issues as could be imaginable all right senator ed markey thanks for being with me you're welcome hey there I'm Chris Hayes from
