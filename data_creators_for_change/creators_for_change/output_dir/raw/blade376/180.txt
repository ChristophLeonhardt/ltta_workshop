<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known d.video first try by</font>

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,059
geriatric 1927 I was just amazed by the

12
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,680
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate</font>

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,680
freely their ideas free video<font color="#CCCCCC"> form hello</font>

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,149
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it though at</font>

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,500
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your clip I don't know I</font>

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,610
assume that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,480
yeah right ok gotta take you from there

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean because we're</font>

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,149
obviously from very different generation

20
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,430
I'm sure I'm older than your dad what

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,069
what gives what so when when when did

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,810
you first become aware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube in</font>

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,180
particular it was three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago peter</font>

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,680
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> jerry action 27 he'd done this video</font>

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,549
and although it was his video that

26
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,409
interested me what interested me more

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,369
was the fact that people were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,920
post video responses yes and for me what

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,229
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shows what YouTube has which</font>

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,210
a lot of other places<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have which</font>

31
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the YouTube experience and that is</font>

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,450
these aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just videos with dealing</font>

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,130
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is there's something in</font>

34
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,040
between it there's this social network

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,570
and it's now a medium in which people

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,420
can share their ideas and for me video

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,670
blogging is the purest form<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

38
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,040
creativity because whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are a</font>

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,560
reporter you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do philosophy the music</font>

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,110
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> an artist you can incorporate</font>

41
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,600
these in any combination into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,310
and I think that's why when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">people across the board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world</font>

44
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,360
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that in gatherings we all have</font>

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,490
this common denominator so everyone has

46
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,079
this way of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> open minded to new</font>

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,229
ideas and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share their views</font>

48
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,189
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and I mean what I mean you</font>

49
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,600
have a like a particular like a

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,190
manifesto then I mean would you say that

51
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,560
you have a sort of a thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to communicate and what my motto is</font>

53
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,780
welcome to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> world will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chance</font>

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,370
to inspire which parades are sound a bit

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,150
hippyish but it's just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it is and</font>

56
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,830
for me is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,670
voice for me it's my journey of being

58
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,560
used to this technology I have as much

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,970
of a clue as the next person to a

60
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,850
certain degree and it is you know I feel

61
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if I put myself out there then</font>

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have no reason to judge anything</font>

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,490
else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people with misjudge</font>

64
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,140
me but it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my journey using</font>

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,900
this technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help others and give</font>

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,700
people confidence I mean and you find

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,710
that if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative comments which</font>

68
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,590
I assume any of your negative comment

69
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,790
diversity there might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> something there</font>

70
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean but you find that that it dampens</font>

71
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,890
you or does it actually go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on oh hang on</font>

72
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,130
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first year our first tee is</font>

73
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,840
actually it<font color="#E5E5E5"> did get to me quite a lot</font>

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,940
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part of it that got to</font>

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,620
me most is because I'm not I don't you

76
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I do comedy videos but it is me</font>

77
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,420
being open<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is who I am that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

78
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,700
are challenging my integrity and we've

79
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,100
got TV shows where people are behind you

80
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,510
later by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably put on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TV</font>

81
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,770
they're already working on something

82
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,690
else completely different as with me I'm

83
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,970
checking the next day and people go you

84
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,200
know you're a liar you're doing this

85
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,750
because you just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> fame for the sake</font>

86
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,630
of it these are questions about You Know

87
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,200
Who am I yeah and I get to see myself in

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,790
third person so what I do is I translate

89
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,830
what they say and look at myself and go

90
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,270
or have they got it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid</font>

91
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,060
misinterpreted myself wrong but up to

92
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,410
this point now I've got a bet right

93
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,470
there and I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on if their</font>

94
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,030
constructive and I mean do you find when

95
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,520
you shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> something do you do you</font>

96
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,680
absolutely put up what you shoot or do

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,330
you kind of self I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

98
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,770
obviously fascinating areas are self

99
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,450
editing but this is a daily recent

100
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,650
experience for the human<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate of it</font>

101
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,459
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it I do edit it and it</font>

102
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,350
depends on what sort of aspects you're

103
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,240
trying to portray for me it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

104
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,850
honesty and I try and Olli edit out the

105
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">herbs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the speech errors and keep</font>

106
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean when i started youtube i</font>

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,750
uploaded 20 minute videos and I've got

108
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,220
to this point now where I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

109
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">a compromise it's not who I am but if I</font>

110
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,738
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inspire people in a wide basis</font>

111
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,180
I've got to sort of say right I need to

112
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">get a large audience but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to keep</font>

113
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,200
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity as well so if I was to be</font>

114
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,210
completely integrable do 30 minute video

115
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,490
no one would<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so I wouldn't be</font>

116
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,199
inspiring anyone in that sense so it's

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,729
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that balance I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

118
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">really important and just to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

119
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,240
jealous what I mean how many what's your

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,910
total view<font color="#E5E5E5"> camp I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

121
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,509
around nine million at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment over</font>

122
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,710
four years I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I know those people</font>

123
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,389
that have overtaken out with one video

124
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,979
yeah in like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to find</font>

125
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,360
so many there's more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> always someone</font>

126
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,270
um but it's just the the interaction

127
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,310
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with I mean it is it's</font>

128
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,050
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for you to even comprehend</font>

129
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,810
that but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is phenomenally</font>

130
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,370
extraordinary to you know that couldn't

131
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,380
have happened nice in the such recent

132
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,539
past completely I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a guy at</font>

133
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,940
home with a computer webcam technically

134
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just talking to a bit of hardware in</font>

135
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,389
my room and somehow it has been viewed

136
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,110
by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mass and you know furthermore I</font>

137
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,220
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and meet them around the world</font>

138
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">right it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just crazy experience and I</font>

139
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,930
mean has it given you the the desire to

140
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,639
then follow that for I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

141
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think is interesting is</font>

142
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,690
what we're that I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

143
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,190
working in this industry are going to go

144
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,569
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that go where can that lead</font>

145
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,280
right maybe that's the wrong question

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,750
maybe it doesn't need to lead anyway

147
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,159
maybe that's it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt don't know i</font>

148
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,020
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big miss communicator miss</font>

149
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,400
comprehension of the issue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

150
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,990
people think that once your YouTube

151
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,280
that's where you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to make it</font>

152
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,599
you know you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube that is it</font>

153
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,039
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not i think it's a good platform to</font>

154
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,300
get on to what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do it's a</font>

good networking site you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do whatever</font>

156
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,860
you want there is that freedom and

157
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,860
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the mass interaction you get</font>

158
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,030
you you hopefully have more of a chance

159
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">to finding it I mean in some way that</font>

160
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:55,020

171
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,740
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that game what was</font>

know be open minded and this is new

174

tenant and if you had a response to that

175
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,130
from potential employers I mean I say

176
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,039
not yet i'm still trying maybe with the

177
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,690
reason we took one look at his youtube

178
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,099
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was it who's out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door</font>

179
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,370
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you tell me about that about</font>

180
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,550
stick aid and winning upstaged and what

181
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,099
that was all about um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I like</font>

182
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:37,860
to take part of things up stage was a

183
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,620
BBC show in 2008

184
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,169
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Endemol and BBC which was six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font>

185
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a glass box entertain the nation</font>

186
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,780
voting was done online and what happened

187
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,060
was I got contacted and so did other

188
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,229
people for YouTube and they wanted us

189
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,850
basically I<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew what they were trying</font>

190
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do they were trying to get us to move</font>

191
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,840
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> our viewer base and make us knock</font>

192
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,220
each other out this competition and

193
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,560
without telling them I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys let's</font>

194
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,840
work together on this and we went along

195
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did it and we won the grand final</font>

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,040
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the percentages of votes we just</font>

197
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,600
freshed everyone and it was this big

198
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,220
frustration because we weren't a

199
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,380
traditional act and to be brief about it

200
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,720
we were against very talented musicians

201
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,220
you know people playing the guitar in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

202
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,740
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's great but because it</font>

203
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,300
was online if I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some plated</font>

204
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,949
so I just look it up on youtube<font color="#CCCCCC"> as our</font>

205
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,229
act was about interaction there in the

206
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">moment you know discussing with people</font>

207
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,470
what do they want us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do even if it</font>

208
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,150
was crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting post-it notes on us</font>

209
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,860
and rolling on the floor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

210
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,240
that interaction and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

211
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,220
get the votes right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of stick</font>

212
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,620
aid the past three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I've done</font>

213
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,110
saying on stickam com which is a webcam

214
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,900
live<font color="#CCCCCC"> website and it's a part of my ethos</font>

215
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,729
I mean people who are geographically

216
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,560
isolated around the world are able to

217
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,470
have a common<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal and achieve it where</font>

218
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,440
I would broadcast a 24-hour web chat and

219
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,780
people sponsor money to go towards I

220
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,099
chase UNICEF because it's a global

221
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,669
charity and you know three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago it</font>

222
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,590
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my bedroom on a webcam this year</font>

223
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,349
I worked in a TV studio and last year

224
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,630
did in LA los angeles and you know this

225
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,510
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely surreal I without internet</font>

226
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,949
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube I wouldn't have achieved</font>

227
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,020
any of this and if I gained a lot from

228
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,510
it then what might my belief is why

229
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,560
should no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one else have that opportunity</font>

230
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,910
and that's what I hope to do with my

231
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,919
videos fantastic so I me know what and

232
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,190
do you have plans that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can reveal of</font>

233
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,810
things you're going to do next I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

234
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,240
have you got I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work you</font>

235
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,430

236
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,830
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great because the BBC is</font>

237
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,809
you know with I planet is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

238
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push it forward at the moment the</font>

239
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,059
thing is I've worked with trying to help

240
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,979
revolutionize the education system with

241
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">mental health therapy excited psychology</font>

242
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,420
you know this technology can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help all of</font>

243
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,040
that but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are on</font>

244
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,589
their high horses like you know what is

245
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:51,300
this it's entertainment and you know

246
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,250
YouTube is very entertainment-based but

247
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,390
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much more to</font>

248
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,220
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know taking that</font>

249
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,480
risk but unfortunately we're at a time

250
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the moment where companies aren't</font>

251
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,030
really willing to make that risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

252
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">right all right well thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why we're</font>

253
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get will carry on we'll carry</font>

254
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,670
on now I should just before because we

255
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,870
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've only got five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five or so</font>

256
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,840
minutes left I would love to open

257
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,120
questions to the floor if anybody's got

258
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,220
any questions for any of the marvelous

259
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,590
panel there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one over there straight</font>

260
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:22,650
away Nick Negredo from input I just

261
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to continue that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question to the</font>

262
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,440
other people whether they thought

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,450
there's any way they can make a living

264
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,850
out of the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet activity</font>

265
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,150
I mean it's such<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rarity and the thing</font>

266
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,680
I find with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is it's all</font>

267
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,810
about integrity as i said earlier on and

268
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean in terms of sponsorship if if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

269
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,070
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video and i'm drinking a can of</font>

270
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,540
coke it's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always use it's</font>

271
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,010
because i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drink the coke so</font>

272
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,140
therefore that is good advertising but

273
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,670
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get people that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on their</font>

274
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,230
videos that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing there with</font>

275
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,730
something which was blatantly put in

276
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,470
their hands then it's not great so I

277
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,270
mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just new grounds that we're</font>

278
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,010
sort of dealing with but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

279
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,130
making money I make nothing from it the

280
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,510
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money I spent on cameras</font>

281
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,730
battery to my camera's out ways how much

282
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,190
I've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my videos completely and</font>

283
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,480
you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do make a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from it</font>

284
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,000
but it is such a rarity but for me I've

285
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,670
gained a lot from it which you can put a

286
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,550
price on I've met great people I've had

287
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,140
Gordon Brown DOOL<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to me on a</font>

288
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,400
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this is stuff that you</font>

289
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,280
can't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a price on and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as</font>

290
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,590
you saying in terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BBC is a</font>

291
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,440
great place to go to for comedy you know

292
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is about using it as a platform to</font>

293
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,940
then go and other things and if you know

294
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,200
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies out there that have</font>

295
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,550
the resources and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see someone on</font>

296
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube who you think they would be good</font>

297
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,810
in this way by<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking something which is</font>

298
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,420
a hobby and paying him to do it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

299
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,590
the chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they gonna do a much</font>

300
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,360
better job with it say and I mean the

301
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,270
danger is then the what drove you to be

balance you've got to strike completely

that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like yes my friend and I was</font>

podcasts and not not<font color="#E5E5E5"> real enough</font>

starting with we now get about court

311
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,430
four million downloads a month and

312
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,940

10 a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> under sixteens writing and</font>

314
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting loads of fan mail hate mail</font>

315
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,070
and people wouldn't advise and I'm just

316
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just chatting about thing my life</font>

317
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,230
and I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that quite a stranger who do</font>

318
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,810
I talk to about that and I wonder if you

319
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,670
get guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people approaching you and</font>

320
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,440
asking you for your opinions on yeah

321
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,600
I've done videos where I've actually

322
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,820
like before Christmas I came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

323
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,710
therapy and i did a video which was

324
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,270
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not alone and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

325
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,100
is what I've been free I may come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

326
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,480
as confident I<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely wasn't</font>

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,060
confident three years ago and that you

328
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,890
know if you're out there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always</font>

329
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,510
someone and for me it's about inspiring

330
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,370
people so you need look to other people

331
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,230
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer but</font>

332
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,410
unfortunately I've been getting emails

333
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,910
people telling me their entire life and

334
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,920
it's all puts that responsibility on me

335
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,350
and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know where do I draw</font>

336
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,290
the line because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had an experience</font>

337
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,520
where there was suddenly came to advise

338
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,890
once and a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later after I gave</font>

339
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,880
her<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice she said it was great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

340
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,830
didn't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her again she then took</font>

341
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,230
her life and it's that moral dilemma of

342
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,240
now we live in a non line community now

343
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,670
where millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people were contacted</font>

344
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,070
with and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's about you not</font>

345
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,960
taking too much responsibility that but

346
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,220
realizing if people are going to get

347
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved with this they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

348
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility for themselves as well</font>

349
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,840
and realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can only talk to so</font>

350
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,150
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

351
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">negative comments if you get people that</font>

352
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,670
are angry at you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

353
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">responding you just realize this it's</font>

354
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,840
not your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it's alright any</font>

355
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,590
anyone else right up the back there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

356
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,050
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> them run that would be a really</font>

357
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,020
good I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work out if the</font>

358
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,270
BBC did open up to user generated

359
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,760
content and we'd obviously be stuck with

360
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,470
all of our standards of policies and

361
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,510
compliances that we will we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

362
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,540
as programme makers would it limit your

363
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,910
creativity too much to try and apply

364
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,800
those policies and standards to your

365
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">content and therefore is it something</font>

366
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,220
that isn't worth looking down the road

367
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you know people in youtuber making</font>

368
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,850
their content do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because they're</font>

369
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,080
passionate and I think they'd be

370
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,260
overwhelmed if they were approached and

371
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,600
you know getting involved with this for

372
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,110

people who are in the profession you

375
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,699
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's their belief</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe</font>

376
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:26,589
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get contacted by so many but I know</font>
