1
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:14,966
>> Tucker: THE ALLEGATIONS

2
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:15,666
MADE BY MICHAEL AVENATTI, ARE

3
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:20,171
THEY TRUE?

4
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:22,206
>> THEY ARE NOT TRUE, I NEVER

5
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:23,374
MET HER AND I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:23,641
IS.

7
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:25,410
THERE WAS A LETTER RELEASED

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:29,247
WITHIN AN HOUR OF THAT BREAKING

9
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,416
FROM 60 PEOPLE WHO KNEW ME, MEN

10
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:34,052
AND WOMEN, SAYING THAT IT WAS

11
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:34,419
NONSENSE.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,554
THE WHOLE THING WAS TOTALLY

13
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:38,056
RIDICULOUS.

14
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,825
>> NONE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE

15
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:41,125
TRUE?

16
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:42,693
>> CORRECT.

17
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:43,261
>> Tucker: THE SENATE

18
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:44,896
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS REFERRED

19
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:47,198
CREEPY LAWYER AND ONE OF HIS

20
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:55,173
CLIENTS, JULIE       TO THE FBI.

21
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:57,175
CREEPY LAWYER AND HIS CLIENT

22
00:00:57,176 --> 00:00:58,076
CLAIMS WITHOUT EVIDENCE THAT

23
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,277
KAVANAUGH WAS INVOLVED IN A VERY

24
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:08,019
LONG SERIES OF GANG RAPES.

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,454
THE CBO SPOKE ABOUT THE CRIMINAL

26
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,789
INVESTIGATION INTO HIM, AND HERE

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,890
IT IS.

28
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,959
>> WE WELCOME THE INVESTIGATION

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,794
REQUESTED BY SENATOR GRASSLEY

30
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:19,964
WHO OBVIOUSLY HAS NO IDEA WHAT

31
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,432
HE HAS JUST DONE.

32
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,401
WHAT HE HAS EFFECTIVELY DONE IS

33
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:25,236
OPEN UP A PANDORA'S BOX AND MY

34
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:26,437
CLIENT AND I ARE VERY MUCH

35
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,141
LOOKING FORWARD TO A FULL AND

36
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:33,744
COMPLETE INVESTIGATION INTO MY

37
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:37,181
CLIENTS ALLEGATIONS.

38
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:38,649
>> Tucker: CREEPY BUT

39
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,150
UNDENIABLY BRASH.

40
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,119
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM THAT'S NOT

41
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,354
THE ONLY BAD NEWS HE RECEIVED

42
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:44,422
TODAY.

43
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,624
CPL ALSO BLEW UP HIS

44
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,391
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COMPLETELY

45
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:49,227
BY SUGGESTING AN INTERVIEW WITH

46
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:50,161
"TIME" MAGAZINE THAT DEMOCRATS

47
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,430
SHOULD NOMINATE A WHITE MAN FOR

48
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:54,265
PRESIDENT IN 2,020.

49
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,700
AS OBVIOUSLY NOT ALLOWED IN

50
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:58,169
TODAY'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

51
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,903
MR. LAWYER WAS PREVIOUSLY SEEN

52
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:01,606
AS A FRONT RUNNER FOR THE

53
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:02,340
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION TWO YEARS

54
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,075
FROM NOW.

55
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:05,676
SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY'S SERVES ON

56
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:07,111
THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND

57
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:08,446
HE'S JOINING US TONIGHT.

58
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:10,248
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND EXPLAINING

59
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:11,482
TO US WITH THIS CRIMINAL

60
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:15,453
REFERRAL IS ABOUT, ON WHAT BASIS

61
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,188
YOU MADE IT?

62
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,589
>> THEY ARE VERY SERIOUS

63
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:18,990
ALLEGATIONS.

64
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:24,295
THE COMMITTEE IS ALLEGING THAT

65
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:27,198
MR. MICHAEL AVENATTI AND

66
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,232
MS. JULIE SWETNICK VIOLATED

67
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,401
TITLE 18 OF THE UNITED STATES

68
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:32,136
CODE, BASICALLY CONSPIRACY,

69
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,471
MAKING A FALSE STATEMENT,

70
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,306
OBSTRUCTION OF A SENATE

71
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:36,941
COMMITTEE.

72
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:37,608
BASICALLY THE BASIS OF THE

73
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:40,912
ALLEGATION IS THAT JULIE

74
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,214
SWETNICK AND MICHAEL AVENATTI

75
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,815
SAID THAT JULIE SWETNICK HAD

76
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,018
PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT JUDGE

77
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:47,685
KAVANAUGH SPIKED PUNCH WITH

78
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,289
DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, AND THAT

79
00:02:51,290 --> 00:03:00,131
JUDGE CAVANAUGH FONDLED AND

80
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:02,833
RAPED WOMEN.

81
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:03,834
THEN WHEN SHE GAVE PERSONAL

82
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,804
INTERVIEWS TO THE NEWS MEDIA,

83
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:09,273
SHE RECANTED MOST OF THAT

84
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:09,840
TESTIMONY.

85
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:10,441
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

86
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:11,175
INTERVIEWED TEN WITNESSES TRYING

87
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:15,213
TO CORROBORATE JULIE SWETNICK'S

88
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:16,414
ALLEGATIONS.

89
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,915
NONE OF THEM COULD, QUITE THE

90
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,116
CONTRARY.

91
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,252
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MS. JULIE

92
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:23,287
SWETNICK WAS JUST A PAWN OR NOT,

93
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,224
THE FBI WILL FIND OUT.

94
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,025
I DON'T KNOW MICHAEL AVENATTI,

95
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,026
BASED ON MY RELATIONSHIP WITH

96
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:32,196
HIM THROUGH THE COMMITTEE, HE

97
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:34,198
CLEARLY HAS A CASUAL

98
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,234
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRUTH.

99
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,435
AND IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HE

100
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,605
WILL DO THE RIGHT THING, BUT

101
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:41,772
ONLY WHEN CONSTANTLY SUPERVISED

102
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:45,409
AND CORNERED LIKE A RAT.

103
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,478
>> Tucker: AND SO WHAT YOU ARE

104
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,512
SAYING IF I'M INTERPRETING THIS

105
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:49,113
CORRECTLY AS THERE IS NO

106
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:55,553
EVIDENCE THAT THESE TEN GANG

107
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:59,290
RAPES TOOK PLACE, THAT WHICH

108
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,224
JULIE SWETNICK SAID SHE WAS

109
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:00,791
PRESENT FOR.

110
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,226
SO THIS WILL BE THE ONE CASE IN

111
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,695
MY MEMORY WHERE SOMEONE ACTUALLY

112
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:07,198
GETS PUNISHED FOR LYING TO A

113
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,932
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE UNDER

114
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:08,633
OATH?

115
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,434
>> AND THIS IS SERIOUS BECAUSE

116
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:13,604
WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS

117
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,939
OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO COME

118
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,273
FORWARD.

119
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:18,142
BUT IF SOMEONE COMES FORWARD AND

120
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:21,578
IT LIES ABOUT, THAT UNDERMINES

121
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,780
THE LEGITIMACY OF THE

122
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:27,618
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE VALID.

123
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:28,319
AND AT ONE POINT WHEN IT WAS

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,157
CLEAR THAT THERE WERE NO CLOCK,

125
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:35,826
CORROBORATING WITNESSES,

126
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:36,527
MR. AVENATTI ALLEGED HE HAD A

127
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:38,796
WITNESS AND WOULD PRESENT A

128
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:39,497
SWORN STATEMENT BUT WOULD NOT

129
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:41,465
TELL US THE NAME OF THE WITNESS.

130
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,501
AND I WILL TELL YOU IT WAS A

131
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:46,437
TURNING POINT IN THE HEARING.

132
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:49,807
I THINK EVEN IF YOU ASK THE

133
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:52,043
DEMOCRATS, WHEN MR. AVENATTI

134
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:53,644
ENTERED THE PICTURE, IT WAS

135
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:55,846
CLEAR WE WERE GETTING INTO THE

136
00:04:55,847 --> 00:00:00,000
FOOTHILLS OF THE PREPOSTEROUS.
