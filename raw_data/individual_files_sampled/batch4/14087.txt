the rapper yg whose real name is Daquan rape something-something Jackson anyway he got kicked off an American Airlines flight for being wasted but he says it's because of racism more on that story coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel so there's this rapper out there he goes by yg but his real name is Kenan Daquan Dre Jackson I don't listen to garbage rap music I listen to it back in the day when it was good but I don't think that's been the case for I don't know ten years anyway I don't listen to this guy's music either I have no idea what he sounds like or raps like or whatever but there is one song that I am familiar with and it is called blank Donald Trump the F word this yg kid came out with the song during the spring of 2016 during the election year he performed it at Coachella where of course being a music festival here in LA or outside LA the crowd went absolutely wild because they're a bunch of morons who think that that constitutes edginess and creativity anyway fast forward to just last month and this guy was in the cosmos a cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas a guy wanted to take a picture with him and his crew push the guy away this guy apparently told yg that he wasn't a real celebrity and yg yanked the chain off his neck which was valued between three and nine thousand dollars so yg was arrested and booked on felony theft so that's his background that pretty much tells you the extent of his fame and the depth of his talent and now he's been kicked off of an American Airlines flight he was wasted he claims he wasn't but he posted a video on Twitter after the incident by the way if you're ever trying to deny the fact that you're drunk do not post a video it removes any plausible deniability also the whole net covered in tattoos thing it just kind of says that you don't want to win at life so anyway he tweets this video ranting and raving about how they kicked him off and they said that he was drunk but he said he's not drunk he says that it's because of hmm let me shuffle through my imaginary deck of things to be outraged about done tada what's the card racism yep throughout the video he is saying American Airlines is racist f-bomb f-bomb f-bomb American Airlines is effing racist blah blah blah blah blah Oh American Airlines on blood they kicked me off the planet um oh I'm drunk know what we gone they kicked me off the planet said I'm drunk I'm sober than a month races ice motherfuckers it's my bad races ass month I'm sold write it up now I'm actually quite sure that's how he talks normally but you can tell by the condition of his eyes that he's not sober he's got that whole like droopy eyelid thing going on he's clearly been partying like a brain-dead lab monkey and American Airlines had every right to kick him off in my opinion and you guys know that I have a lot of those pesky opinion things so let me know what you guys think in the comments thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
