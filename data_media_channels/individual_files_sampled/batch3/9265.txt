TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND THAT IS WHERE THEY REALLY, INNOCENCE, SENSE, SAVE MY LIFE. Martha: TONIGHT GENERAL KEANE SHARES HIS OWN UNTOLD STORY. HE MADE SOME VERY CLOSE FOR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS UP THERE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WE WERE FIGHTING FOR. THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR STORY THAT IS SO POWERFUL FOR HIM THAT HE HAS NOT TRADED PUBLICLY UNTIL NOW. I HAD TO DO AN ASSESSMENT FOR GENERAL PETRAEUS FOR TWO YEARS DURING THE IRAQI SURGE AND HE ASKED ME TO DO MUCH THE SAME IN AFGHANISTAN WHEN HE WAS ASSIGNED THERE. WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE VISIT WAS TO UNITS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE HEAVIEST FIGHTING WE HAD EVER UNDERTAKEN IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR. THE MISSION OF THE PATROL WAS TO TAKE ME AND LINK UP WITH THREE TRIBAL CHIEFS, WHO HAD BEEN HELPING THE AMERICANS EVER SINCE WE ARRIVED IN THE VALLEY. AT SOME RISK TO THEMSELVES. SO THEY PUT ME IN THE MIDDLE OF PATROL, TOOK THE DOUBLE FILE WALKING DOWN EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD, A DIRT ROAD. AND HE SAYS SIR, MAKE SURE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE FOOTPRINT OF THE SOLDIER IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE JUST LAST WEEK WE LOST A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS ON THIS VERY ROAD DUE TO IED MINES. SO OFF WE GO, A COUPLE OF MILES AND WE HOOK UP WITH THE TRIBAL CHIEFS IN THE MUD HUT WHICH IS USED TO STORE HARVESTED GRAPES. THIS IS A VALLEY FULL OF GRAPES AND VINEYARDS. FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIA FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIL FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIC FREE TRAVEL THREE TRII FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIF FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIS FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIA FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIL FREE TRAVEL THREE TRII FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIS FREE TRAVEL THREE TRID FREE TRAVEL THREE TRIE WITH AK-47s AND THEY HAD PUT A RUG DOWN. I STARTED BY ASKING HIM, WHY? WHY ARE YOU WILLING TO HELP THE AMERICANS AND PUT YOURSELF SO MUCH AT RISK TO DO SO? ONE CHIEF SPOKE AND HE SPOKE THROUGHOUT THE SESSION. HE SAID IT, SIR, IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE, ABOUT CHILDREN, AND THE OTHERS NODDED. HE SAID WE HAVE NO LIFE HERE UNDER THE TALIBAN. THE TALIBAN AND TELL US HOW TO DRESS, HOW TO EAT, THEY TELL US WHAT TO DO, THEY TELL US HOW TO DO IT. THEY BEAT US, THEY BEAT OUR WOMEN, AND WE GET BLOWN UP BY THE IEDs. HE SAID, AMERICANS CAN HELP US GET A FUTURE LIFE. I TOOK ALL OF THAT IN AND I SAID IT, CHIEFS, THE RISK IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT. TO ALL OF YOU. AND HE CAME BACK AND HE SAID, THEY ARE WATCHING US RIGHT NOW. AND HE SAYS, WE KNOW WHAT THAT RISK IS BUT IT'S OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE THAT WE CARE ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING IT. SO I SAID I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE TROOPS THAT ARE HERE, ON BEHALF OF GENERAL PRETORIUS, FOR THE SACRIFICE THAT YOU ARE MAKING. AND I SAID IT, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU? AND HE SAID, WELL, YES. WE NEED SCHOOLTEACHERS. AND HE SAID, WE NEED A DIRT ROAD TO GET TO THE PERIMETER ROAD TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GET OUR GRAPES OUT AND THEREFORE IT WILL HELP US PRESERVE THEM. I LOOKED AT THE BATTALION COMMANDER AND THE BATTALION COMMANDER HAD AN INTERPRETER AND HE SAID, WHAT ABOUT IT? AND HE SAID, IT'S IN THE SYSTEM. I SAID CALL ME WHEREVER I AM. I CAME BACK A FEW MONTHS LATER BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE RESULTS WERE. NOW NO FOOT PATROL, I'M DRIVING ALONG THE ROWS OF THE VALLEY AND THE TALIBAN I HAVE BEEN TOLD HAD BEEN CLEARED OUT ENTIRELY. ALONG THE ROADS THERE WERE PEOPLE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREETS, THERE WERE KIDS, I STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND I WAS TALKING TO THE KIDS. I HAD SEEN NO CHILDREN BEFORE, NO VILLAGERS. AND THEY ARE WAVING AT US, BECAUSE THESE ARE THE AMERICAN TROOPS COMING BY. WE GET UP TO THE VILLAGE, AND THE BATTALION COMMANDER MEETS ME AND HE SAYS, OKAY JOHN, I HAVE TO PREPARE YOU FOR SOMETHING. THE CHIEF THAT YOU ARE TALKING TO, HE WAS KILLED ABOUT A WEEK OR SO AFTER YOU LEFT, HE WAS ASSASSINATED. HE SAID ONE OF THE OTHER CHIEFS WAS BLOWN UP, AND HE LOST PART OF HIS LEG. HE WILL BE AT THE MEETING. HE'S GOING TO DO THE TALKING. SO I SAT DOWN ON THE RUG, NOW THIS TIME IN THE VILLAGE, WITH PEOPLE ALL AROUND, AND WE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PASSING OF THE CHIEF AND PRAISED HIM FOR HIS BRAVERY, HIS COURAGE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR HIS PEOPLE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT THE TALIBAN AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, SIR, TODAY IS A BIG DAY. SO I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN EGO AND I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS THERE. AND I SAID, WHAT IS HAPPENING? AND HE SAID SIR, THE TEACHER IS COMING TODAY. AND I SAID, OH, MY GOD, THAT'S AMAZING. HE SAID THAT WAS REAL PROGRESS. SO I SAID, WHAT ABOUT THE ROAD? DID YOU GET YOUR ROAD? AND HE HELD UP TWO FINGERS. I LOOKED AT THE BATTALION COMMANDER AND HE SAID, WE OPENED UP TO ROADS. BUT I TELL THE STORY BECAUSE IT'S A WINDOW INTO WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON IN AFGHANISTAN. THE TALIBAN ARE FANATICAL TYRANTS WHO ARE PRESSING THEIR FELLOW AFGHAN HE IS. AND WHAT THE AMERICANS AND THE AFGHAN STATE IS, THEY CAME IN THERE. AMERICANS WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARE ABOUT IN LIFE, AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF THEM. WHY IS THIS FIGHT SO IMPORTANT TO YOU? FROM THERE, THE AL QAEDA PLOTTED AND KILLED AMERICANS, 3,000 PLUS.
