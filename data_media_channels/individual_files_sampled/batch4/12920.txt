German dictator literally back to life by harnessing the lightning in the laboratory in the penthouse of Trump Tower York Times editor-in-chief blithering prevarication the third issued one of his more restrained statements on the Trump Supreme Court pic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also chimed in with these carefully planned remarks Schumer promised a stage a Senate fight against the candidate that would divide the country destroy the Democratic Party threaten the future of free governments throughout the West and put an end to life on Earth because he said quote it's the right thing to do unquote angry leftist meanwhile gathered outside the Supreme Court to protest the selection of literally Hitler - the court women's March organizer Sharia Moore told reporters quote this Supreme Court pick is literally Hitler literally a short German man with a small mustache who literally caused World War two he will literally murder Jews enslave women and set the entire world on

dot-com / Andrew it is lots of fun so there are three aspects to this I want to talk about I hope we can get them all in today Jenna's gonna help us with the judicial the legal aspects of it but first let's talk a little bit about the political aspects of picking brat Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court you know I think the politics here before we even talk about whether the pick is good I mean I think the pick is good I don't think it's the best pick but I think it's a good solid conservative pick but I think the politics is absolute genius it's you know you always have to guess what a / you start to learn what a president is thinking Trump is particularly hard because he's such a showmen he's always doing this kind of magician trick where he is distracting me with chaos well he's governing basically in a big good central right-wing conservative way no but he has all the noise and the craziness going on so people forget that you know that he's actually doing this solid job but you know he picked the safer of the nominees he safe guy guys been around for a long time and in Washington I've been on the circuit court he's got over 300 decisions for people to look at which is great even though I liked Amy Barrett a little more she has a much less of a paper trail and I think a paper trail is more important than personality and more important than philosophy because it tells you what you actually do when you get on the court but I think the thing about this is is that because he's a safe bet and because he's so credentialed he will probably get confirmed before the midterms right unless they find that he's got berries literally bodies buried in his backyard senators from red states are gonna be under a lot of pressure they're gonna try and pull that thoughtful rejection thing well I thought about it but I reject it I do not think that's gonna play in states like you know Indiana and North Dakota and West Virginia West Virginia I think Trump won by like 40 points I don't think joe Manchin is gonna get away with saying well I thought about it but I couldn't do it so they're caught in a vise all of these things I mean you know they're I think because he's basically such a solid establishment candidate he's not gonna get defections from you know the usual suspects Lisa Murkowski from Maine and Susan call Susan Collins from Maine Lisa Murkowski from Alaska but the thing is here's the big thing if the left gets hysterical and starts to scream he's literally Hitler and it ends they're already doing they've already started with this but if they get it get hysterical they're gonna shoot they're gonna use their ammunition ammunition they're gonna blow their ammunition then if Trump gets re-elected as I think as things stand right now I think he will and if Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies which after all has to happen sometime I mean I've said this before but they keep printing out these pictures of her doing the plank you know but they don't mention that she actually hasn't moved from that because for 35 days so it may actually just be rigor mortis I'm not sure I mean if she goes this liberal justice and then he picks Amy Barrett somebody like that's a real solid all the way conservative he's got him right because they've already done the extremists literally Hitler stuff about Neil Gorsuch and they've done it about they'll have done it about Brett Kavanaugh and it just won't play people just will not be listening and then the balance of the court can really change so Trump I think has actually on purpose with that instinct that he has he has outmaneuvered them let us pray as Jen on let's let's bring on Jenna Ellis she's the director of public policy for the James Dobson Family Institute an accomplished constitutional law attorney she's appeared just about everywhere but most importantly she's appeared here and will continue every time something happens at the Supreme Court her book is the legal basis for a moral Constitution a guide for Christians to understand America's current constitutional crisis Jenna you you've gonna start paying rent here and it's always a pleasure to be on and especially with all the things that are going on in this Supreme Court I anticipate that we'll have many future conversations I hope so I hope so it really has been incredibly busy so what do you think but what's your take I agree with what you just said that Cavanaugh is really the safe pick and I have to ask you know why were conservative so excited about Amy Barrett well because of who she was as a woman who she was as a mother she has seven children she's a very pro-life she's a very Christian all of those things are incredibly important but when it comes to the legal of what a confirmation hearing is all about and what a justice ultimately on the Supreme Court is vested with doing under their oath of office there really should be no significant difference between Barrett and Kavanagh when we're talking about originalism and that's why I think that President Trump likely selected him because Cavanaugh will probably skirt some of the more difficult questions like senator Feinstein posed to Amy Kony Barrett when she was up for confirmation for the Seventh Circuit and Brett Kavanaugh has been very as you said he's on the record with over 300 decisions he's been an originalist on he has made decisions on the DC Circuit Court recognized his margins of being on the circuit court not on the Supreme Court so he's not only a safe pick but I think is one that ultimately will serve conservatism and we're talking about what conservatism really means we're conserving the Constitution protecting preserving the rule of law and so I'm actually excited about this Peck I think that any one of the 25 would have been great but especially right before midterms this was very savvy of the president you know I'm really happy to hear you say that because you're with James Dobson Family Institute so I know you're what you know with the left would call an alt right far right right right alt you know social conservative so you actually are happy I mean I I felt the same way the thing that bothered me about Amy Barrett is that the biography the biography is great but that's not always a good indication of who a person is on the bench I mean that's where that's where it all tells so let me ask you about some of these decisions that have given conservatives pause all right there's a couple of things they love the fact that he's a strong Second Amendment guy he's very big on gun on gun rights but he had this decision 7 Skye and it was kind of a complicated thing but this is where he said the court didn't have his court didn't have jurisdiction over Obamacare not because their penalty was a tax but because it was assessed and collected as if it were a tax and this later people feel fed into John Roberts I think terrible decision saying that this was a tax and that's why Obamacare was constitutional does this give you any pause at all you know in looking at a circuit court judge they are bound not only by the Constitution but also precedent because we look at article 3 then there is one Supreme Court and any other such inferior courts and that word inferior is key and so for this decision as well as the others that some on the right do have concerns about with Kavanagh I think that the questions that need to come out from the GOP senator are asking him to explain his judicial philosophy and if he can explain this by saying you know I was bound by not only the law that Congress passed because taxation under the sixteenth amendment as well as in article one section eight that's given to Congress and and so he he on the circuit court it has to stay within his margin and within those lanes but if he describes it that way in his confirmation hearings that should actually be hopeful for conservatives conservatism because when then something like Roe versus Wade and that type of an abortion decision and that type of case may come in front of him then we can hope and expect that he will likewise stay in the constitutional lane and say those types of decisions all of the social issues are fully unconstitutional under federalism and need to be given back to the states so I think that we can't just look at the ultimate decision we have to look at the rationale because the legal rationale is almost always the key to understanding a judicial philosophy okay I you know I want to ask you about roe v wade because this is of course the scare tactic of the left this is always the thing that is up I have to read an ad can you give me one minute of patience and I'll get right back to you I have to talk about it is a it is actually a thrill and a delight to talk about a blue apron it is such good food it is basically a service that delivers ingredients and instructions to your house so you can home cook restaurant level meals or if you are me you can sit with a glass of wine watching your wife cook restaurant level meals and making interesting comments I hope they've got incredibly good selection of food you can just go on their website take a look and you will see you've got the honey chip off chip how do you pronounce this chip on glazed chicken with poblano and lime rice chapati wine everything is to blah blah chicken fajitas with sauteed mushrooms and sweet peppers it is good stuff that you really is it's really terrific they've got they offer 12 new recipes each week customers can pick two three or four recipes based on what best fits their schedule they send non-gmo ingredients and meat with no added hormones check out this week's menu and get your first three meals free at blue apron calm slash Andrew that's blue apron calm slash Andrew to get your first three meals free blue apron it is a better way to cook alright so row v Wade another decision that Cavanaugh was on involved in in this circuit court this was where the illegal immigrant was demanding that she be given an abortion before being deported before anything else and he agreed with the court that she should not have the right to get an abortion before she was deported that this was not an undue burden on her but he didn't attack roe v wade in the decision and so conservatives felt that that was a red flag is that a red flag to you I don't think so in the context of that opinion because again um whether or not he wanted to do what we what we call in the legal world dicta which is kind of the you know off subject and indicating where the court may go if the case arose in front of a judge that they actually had that particular subject matter but for him again this is just staying in his Lane because Planned Parenthood versus Casey is unfortunately currently the precedent from the Supreme Court it's unconstitutional we've talked to about that Andrea and why and and yet being on the DC Circuit Court he is still bound by that and respects the rule of law respects stare decisis as a principle and so to not go out of his way to attack from an ideological perspective he's actually what a judge should do because remember that these judicial officers are not vested with political commentary in fact the judicial code of ethics which covers all federal judges and even state judges doesn't cover Supreme Court justices they're not supposed to indicate their political preferences and so when we look at the confirmation hearings this type of line of questioning is totally irrelevant to his fitness on the bench and we also have to remember I agree with what you said in the beginning as well that this is totally just a political talking point because this is the left attacking President Trump Trump is not the one being confirmed here it's just a judge and whether or not he will follow his oath of office to uphold the Constitution okay great that's that's a really good take I have one more I want to run by you because these are the things the conservatives were worried about before he was picked one of the some of the reasons that they were looking at Amy Barrett and giving her better marks basically than Kavanagh the other one was one where the Obama care was trying to force some priests to pay for contraception priests for life I think the organization was called and Cavanaugh came down on the gate made the right decision he came down on the on the basis of the priests rights to their religious convictions but he did concede that the government had a compelling interest in providing contraception to the employees now as I read the decision and I thought he was just saying that this is what the Supreme Court had decided through Anthony Kennedy in in I guess it was the Hobby Lobby case but but this made conservatives very nervous does that here's another one there's this as an alt right right right all palt does this bother you at all yeah you know that's another one that I think that that would be an appropriate line of questioning to ask him to say we're do you balance this sort of strict scrutiny versus intermediate scrutiny and these types of constitutional principles where you're balancing a legitimate or compelling governmental interest how do you define those versus a fundamental right and so the fundamental free exercise of religion on judge Kavanagh has been through the Federalist Society many think he led one of their religious liberty groups while he was there when he was still in private practice I mean he has a remarkable record on issues of First Amendment and religious liberty and so for these types of opinions that's where the Senate really does need to come in and say if this is something that's genuinely bothering conservatives and I think that is a legitimate question for him to just have him explain that and say how do you in your judicial analysis balance this so that we can have that on the record because that would be a function of his capacity as a judge well I have to say you're giving me a lot of hope you have a very optimistic view of this you feel you obviously feel this is a strong pick am I am I getting that right I do and I think that all four of the top candidates as well as the list of 25 I mean President Trump had a vetted list this was open and transparent more than any other president and so he really couldn't make a wrong decision here Cavanaugh was not my particular first choice I don't think it was with with the James Dobson family Institute but at the same time we recognize that that President Trump had a great list of excellent jurist to pick from and as long as the nominee and the eventual confirmed justice will conserve the Constitution that's what we need to really really care about not their political preferences and not their personal lives I I couldn't agree more can you tell me who the first pick was I really liked Amy Barrett I also liked Catholic and I liked her from the standpoint not frankly of not only optics but I think that we just had a trust in in what her judicial philosophy was not because of who she is as a person but I really liked her Notre Dame Law Review article on stare decisis I think as a professor she had a lot of judicial philosophy that was very transparent that we don't necessarily see in some of these opinions because they don't get as philosophical as they are legal okay Jen Ellis a director of public policy for the James Dobson Family Institute she probably just stay on the line until we talk to you again I hope to see you soon thanks a lot so that was that was very optimistic I'm really happy to hear that I kind of feel the same way I think this is a good solid pick remember you know the guy is well let's take a look at his judicial philosophy of just a little bit he put it forward as Trump I made the appointment he put it forward in a very succinct statement this cut number two my judicial philosophy is straight forward a judge must be independent and must interpret the law not make the law a judge must interpret statutes as written and a judge must interpret the Constitution as written and formed by history and tradition and precedent for the past eleven years I've taught hundreds of students primarily at Harvard Law School I teach that the Constitution's separation of powers protects individual liberty this thing about separation of power is very very important okay because it means that he will defer to the executive and he will defer to the legislature and they have to remember this about Obamacare we hated we conservatives hated Obamacare and we thought it was unconstitutional to find people for not doing something I think that that is definitely an unconstitutional thing to do but also when you respect the separation of powers Barack Obama and his legislature were duly elected legally elected they passed the law the Supreme Court you want the Supreme Court to be very slow to say no no we're going to decide what the law is you don't want them doing that and that is one of the things that makes these guys more modest you know more restrained than people who are strict originalist like Clarence Thomas would just say no that's against the Constitution you're out of here so he is going to be a little bit more restrained on that but you know I don't think the question is whether his philosophy of restraint you know he's trying to protect what they call the sovereign in England the sovereign is the king or the queen right and then that her power it goes down through the Parliament here the sovereign is the people but the sovereign are not are represented in government they're not allowed to touch the controls of the government so the sovereign picks the people to represent them than the representatives put forward and then what he's saying is this separation of power means that judiciary and and Matthew Peterson is going to come on and talk about this and explain why this is so important but and what the judge is saying he doesn't want to get in the way of the separation of powers I think he's going to be more conservative than we fear it's always true that is the danger is always from the left you know they always say the left always gets their judges right simple reason for that the left all the temptations of power move you to the to the left anybody who falls prey to the temptation of power and over uses his power will be essentially on the left right because that's what leftism is it's loose date its statism it's the state dictating what you do so it's harder to find a guy who says yes I'm going to make decisions that limit my power I'm gonna make decisions that limit the power of the judiciary that's hard to do but if this guy comes through and he is more conservative I think it's very doubtful to me that roe v wade will be overturned if roe v wade is overturned it's not gonna stop people from getting abortions you can get abortions over the counter at this point isn't there abortions are not gonna go away but I think it would be great not just for us but for the left roe v wade repealing roe v wade would increase and strengthen federalism the rights of the states to make their own laws about important issues that means that you have to go to the state meet the people in the state convince the people in the state that you are right and get them to elect representatives who will vote with what you want that would be really good for the left that would get them out of New York we'd get them out of LA it would help them meet the people in the rest of this country understand who they are understands what they're talking about and if they really still hate them then they can leave which would be great for everybody all right the left-wing dictionary will probably be talking about this for days and days the fight goes on the hysteria from the left will be fun don't forget to get your leftist ears tumblr you are going to need it but right now let's do the lefties dictionary the new one is D for diversity D is for diversity in lefties diversity is the property of being the same as everyone else when leftists achieve diversity it means everyone now agrees that diversity is good so they are diverse because they are the same if anyone disagrees that diversity is good he is different and therefore not diverse and that's bad he must be forced to agree that diversity is good then he will be the same which is diverse and that's good now this may seem a bit strange to people who think diversity means being diverse let me try to clear up the confusion diverse people look diverse that is they have different color skin and have sex in different ways and some of them may even be women instead of just regular people but under leftism diverse people must not be diverse in important ways like in their thoughts or beliefs or opinions in those ways they must be the same in lefties that's what diversity means being the same here is a brief Q&A to help clarify things q let's say you have a group of white men with many different opinions and viewpoints some are right-wing and some are left-wing some are religious and summer atheists some are creative and some are more analytical are they diverse a no a group of white people is not diverse because they're all the same q but isn't being the same the same as being diverse a no diversity means being the same in that you are diverse whereas if you are all the same and not being diverse you are not diverse but the same q but wait if you are the same and being not diverse aren't you actually diverse because you are the same a you are beginning to get on my nerves Q is that diverse were the same a shut up all right that didn't work out as well as I'd hope but the important point about diversity is this it is wrong to exclude a person because of race or sexuality or gender because everyone is the same and it's important to include every race and sexuality and gender because all of them are so different so we must be the same and including what's different because what's different is the same and what's the same is of course very different if this makes sense to you you are beginning to get the hang of lefties D is for diversity I'm Andrew Clavin with the Lefty's dictionary that man is out of his mind alright we got a break from YouTube and Facebook but come on over to the daily wire.com listen to the rest of the show and while you're there subscribe so you can be in the mailbag tomorrow the conversation next Tuesday ask your questions the answers are guaranteed correct I mean what else do you want for your lousy 10 bucks a month I mean come on we got a good interview coming up come on over all right I don't talk about the Claremont Institute enough I think it is a great thing thank they're there Claremont Review of Books is one of my favorite journals I don't know what the call is not really a magazine because it comes on newspaper paper but it really is a wonderful Journal of review of books and in you know just politics and general very deep stuff but they are battlers of the administrative state and one of the great things about Brett Kavanaugh is he has come out and said that the rule of instead of unelected administrative bodies is not in the Constitution this Chevron law they call what we'll talk all about this with Matthew Peterson because Matthew Peterson is the vice president of education at the Claremont Institute he directs the Institute's fellowship programs which educate each rising generation of leaders dedicated to constitutional government he just completed two weeks of intensive seminars with the impressive 2018 publius fellows I know some of those guys they are it really is a great program here is Matthew Peterson from the Claremont Institute talking about the administrative state Matthew Peterson thank you very much for coming on today it's great to be here thanks for having me I you know I want to talk to you before before I begin to ask you questions I want to say that one of my gripes against conservatives is they get very boring names to things the left always knows to makes things sound scary so they say like racial profiling to describe police work or objectifying women to describe the fact that men like to look at women but we come up with the administrative state which is very hard even to understand what it means so let me begin therefore in in words of one syllable describe to people what exactly the administrative state is sure yes first let me just let me just agree with what you said I mean deep state is much better right deep state is scary and and it signifies them it's a much better signifier the administrative state very simply consists in all the departments and agencies that are ostensibly technically underneath the President of the United States so the administrator administrative state is really just a collection a large collection a growing collection of federal agencies and departments from the EPA to the IRS the Social Security Administration all this the alphabet soup of modern life all these federal agencies and departments that's really what what the word refers to so why should we fear and hate it as indeed I do therein lies a tale I mean I think most people naturally they naturally many Americans are suspicious we know this from polling and our experience in our own lives of the administrative state of this Colossus is confusing morass of bureaucracy so the reason the reason I think you should fear it though is not it doesn't manage with numbers or statistics or they're kind of buzz words that that experts use the reason we should fear it is because it's grown into a thing that that keeps on growing that seemingly can't be stopped and that violates the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution and that I think is that the important thing too for everyone listening to understand we need to be able to articulate how the administrative state deviates from the principles of American constitutionalism and government well okay how does it why does it do it specifically well here we have to understand something about the founding itself and our system of government so from the very beginning we had this notion of separation of powers right and the idea wasn't that you separate power for its own sake you separate power just you know throw a wrench in the Machine so government isn't efficient the idea was you separate certain kinds of power because different kinds of power have a different kind of character so and if you combine different kinds of power its tyrannical everyone knows this from watching westerns if anyone still watches westerns which I hope they do we all know that judge jury and executioner is a problem right we don't want the judge to be the judge jury and executioner why because we're combining different kinds of power into one man in a way that gives that person tyrannical tyrannical control over our lives so of course we have three branches of government a judiciary an executive and a Congress Congress is supposed to make the law and Congress creates these agencies and departments that the executive direct sex acute the law and the judges then judge disputes concerning the law well the problem the administrative state is Congress now has has devolved power has given power to these agencies underneath the president but eh they're not really underneath the president in the sense that the president can fire whoever he wants its enormous ly hard to fire federal employees as everyone kind of sort of knows as president Trump has been talking about you can't fire them so the executive really isn't in charge they last from from generation to generation from administration to administration most people in the large pyramid stay there so so they're not really being controlled by the executive second Congress is supposed to oversee them Congress is supposed to make sure they're doing a good job and as we see lately Congress isn't overseeing them very well Congress gives away its power to these agencies and Congress is supposed to make the law but when Congress has created these agencies of the last hundred years it allows the agencies themselves to make law in the form of regulation and every year Federal Register comes out there's hundreds of thousands of pages of regulation of essentially law with force behind it that these agencies are creating without any sort of political oversight from Congress so so right there you have in a nutshell I think that the problem the separation of powers right the administrative agencies have have combined the powers of Congress and the executive without political oversight and without being beholden to the people okay that that there's a very clear explanation of what's happening give me a specific example of how it doesn't have to be a real thing but how this could play out in sub person's life well I mean there's different there's so many different kinds of examples take one from from today's headlines that I rather like many I'm sure in the audience remember when Obama was president it turned out that the IRS was targeting organizations that they deemed to be on the right they were essentially treating them unfairly right when it comes to taxation and auditing them and going after them in all kinds of ways well that impact a lot of people's lives talked to people who ran nonprofits during that time who you know who had to deal with all kinds of problems because the IRS made their lives miserable now when you think about this this was exposed over time right Congress is in charge of the IRS did Lois Lerner that these people get in trouble for what they didn't I mean Congress should be able to turn around and say we make the laws we oversee the IRS we think you were acting unfairly unjustly and you you help too you know you screwed with these people's lives but but what really happened from that who who is accountable right and you see this now in of course the really controversial stuff when it comes to the FBI and the Russian collusion and you know all this stuff that's in the news right what you see is federal agencies parts of the administrative state looking over to Congress and saying yeah maybe kind of will sort of get you the documents you want what you see is in the text messages between these people a disdain right for the power of Congress to oversee them and many people's lives have been impacted you know throughout we've seen this they're in that they're in the headlines today and if if you get abused by this state by one of these agencies and you want to appeal you have to appeal to the agency don't you yeah that's a a tremendous problem there's there's a whole administrative law system right a kind of shadow court system that deals with administrative law there's administrative law judges when when they change their regulations there is a process that they go through and you can complain or say you think they should change the regulation this way and that way but what but you really don't have a lot of say they listen they'll publish what they want in the Federal Register and from those proceedings and if you really want to you know let's say you you really you feel like you need to go to court you're facing a colossus I mean you're facing a very very powerful entity that again it needs to be under political control though the real the real secret here to controlling the Ministry of state or railing it back is making sure that elected officials have say and power over it it went I keep hearing about the chevron decision at the Supreme Court is that part of this is that part of the problem yeah so is Chevron I mean the idea the idea there was that that in conduct that the courts should defer to the administrative agencies when they went when they do what they want to do and what we're seeing now I think is a is hopeful I mean if we're going to turn this around we need people in the courts who are willing just like Congress needs to be willing to to really shake up the administrative state to shake up these agencies and say hey we're going to hold you accountable you can't just do what you want according to your own regulations we're not going to defer to you anymore so so one of the hopeful things for people on the right who want this solve this problem is that we do have a rising generation a rising tide of people in the courts who who are going to be I think you know increasingly are being put into place by the president now I think was essential also to realize though is that the reason we have some of these people who will help hold the administrative state accountable in the courts is because of generations of a really conservative scholarship and action that was smart that was organized and that looked back to find out what's the real problem and and that's that's a de Clermont Institute that's forty years of scholarship I mean we pride ourselves and kind of pioneering the notion of the progressives the administrative state and explaining how they arose and and what the problem is and organizations like us I think we really spearheaded this in many ways in scholarship but then we go out you go out to people and start educating them and then you have a whole class of new leaders who can actually tackle the problem education here is an enormous problem for us right and solving all of this because in most schools you'd be taught if you're a lawyer that the administrative state is a-ok it's the evolution you know it's progress right it's evolutionary progress it's all good it is one of the things that I find very frustrating it is great to have you come on and speak about this as clearly as you are because it's a Cobb viously is a cop the subject but just getting to the basics of how you know these people can come in and really ruin people's lives and at Bret Stevens the columnist once wrote that the press doesn't understand this because we are protected by the First Amendment but you're not protected if you're running a lumberyard or just a business somewhere and that's where they get you this recently Scott Pruett had to resign from the EPA and I understand enough journalists I trust have said that Pruett was being a little careless with his ethical decisions but it did still seem like a kind of assassination to me how powerful how hard is it going to be to go into an organization like the EPA which has been sanctified by the left and really reform it it's it's obviously it's very difficult right you you've seen this you know your whole life I mean every every time there's there's everyone likes to say they're going to reform things are going to make it more efficient and when you try to do that in any way whatsoever you're you're fighting more than City Hall you're fighting the Imperial City so in Pruitt's case look I don't know the details about you know I he resigned but let me say that there are certainly cases I am aware of where people were going to be appointed recently to be put in charge of these agencies and the agency's own lawyers okay their counsel did everything they could right did everything they could to kick up the dust and to screw over whoever was trying to come in and you have to understand I mean there's there's an enormous amount of power here and they live in symbiosis they live in a symbiotic relationship with Congress and that's what's unnatural that's what we need to change when when Congress holds them to account they should be able to say look we we control your budget you better come in here and tell us you know we accomplish it put the fear of God into these departments and agencies to hold them accountable but they're not afraid anymore partly because Congress doesn't even pass a budget right I mean we're just continuing continuing appropriations but also because Congress now in many ways is a creature of the administrative state and that's that's an enormous problem but there's a there's a deeper I guess issue here and I and it really is a way of simplifying the issue all these particulars that we talked about and that is to understand that the progressives the progressives really started this around the turn of the last century and when the administrative state was created the people who created it including say Woodrow Wilson right as president to terms president of the Princeton University they explicitly said the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution is outdated we needs we need a number of experts who are rational right in the sense that they they they're not political they they're going to have expert knowledge and we're going to put them in charge of this all this change happening in modern times and they're gonna make things go smoothly and they specifically said this what Wilson said progress he loved that word no word he said comes more often or more naturally to the lips of modern man and everyone else in the past they didn't think or talk about progress they looked to the past but Wilson said we think of the future not the past as the more glorious time in comparison with which the present is nothing so in order to attain this glorious future we need to put up all these experts and PhDs we're just coming into American society at the time the first research universities after the Civil War John Hopkins is is the first of them they modeled the German research university and the idea is we're gonna have all these PhDs shudder right that's like a PhDs and lawyers right I mean Lincoln didn't go to law school right he just went to a panel and proved he knew stuff about law from apprenticeship we're gonna professionalize the ADIZ expert class and what you see is over the last century that expert class being put into place through the administrative state so so so the problem here is that we've got a hundred years or more of education telling american society that we need these credentialed experts who are objective right they're not political they don't get into these debates about what's just and unjust they're just going to go in a programmatic procedural way and solve our problems and of course as we all know they haven't done a very good job it doesn't work out that way I I'm running out of time but I want to ask you the last question Trump it seems to me to have done a really good job in rolling back specific regulations or the numbers of regulations but has he made a dent in the state itself has he done anything to reform the system and is there anything you'd like to see him do well anything I mean this is this is turning around an aircraft carrier right this is moving an iceberg it's going to take time so whatever he does getting rid of regulations is certainly good that's been great but this is a long-term project so number one we have to keep up with the judges we need judges and this they've done a fantastic job of the president has done a fantastic job of this we're going to put in judges who will last for a long time and it will help roll things back from the judiciary side the second thing is more complicated we need Congress to energize itself we need Congress to come back to life we need a new class of congressional leaders who don't look to the president and they don't look to the courts they look to themselves to legislate and to hold these agencies and departments accountable and and that I think is something that the president is is doing in many ways they're frustrated because many times they're complaining they don't know where he stands right they have to stand up for themselves they have he's telling them to legislate god forbid and that's making them very nervous but that's a good thing long-term and III think a lot of people are getting out because they're frustrated with the situation things are changing and that's fine but we're going to need to elect and look for a new class of congressional leaders who understands this problem and are dedicated to fixing it really good explanation Matthew Peterson thank you very much the Claremont Institute one of my favorite think tanks their review is one of my favorite magazines thank you for coming on I appreciate I hope you'll come back and talk again thank you I look forward to coming back all right before we go to sexual Follies I just have to say that this tie rescue where they pulled those 13 12 kids and their coach out of the out of the caves with just an amazing act of heroism one of the ties Navy SEALs summon gunnin died in the effort I have been spelunking mostly against my will because the most terrifying and uncomfortable experience here spelunking is cave exploring and to be trapped underground in a cave truly a nightmare I mean you never experience darkness until you've been underground in a cave and turned off your headlamp you when they talk about you can't see your hand in front of your face you cannot see your hand in front of your face that's how dark it is and you're underground and it's scary incredible heroism incredibly good news that they got them all out sexual follies so I don't sometimes the world is so corrupt that it just becomes hilarious it's probably and this is probably not one of my best personality traits that I find the utter corruption of the human race kind of hilarious sometimes here is pedophiles are moving to be included in the LGBT community which i think is great they can call it the LGBT em community will be lesbians gay bi trans and monsters who destroy the lives of children for their own sexual gratification I think that's gonna really increase the love that people feel for LGBT people LGBT people this is this new thing there reread of files are rebranding themselves as maps or minor attracted persons in an effort to gain acceptance and be included in the LGBT community this is what they call in philosophy a category error and I think it is part of the category error of declaring that gay or lesbian or bi is a identity it is not your identity it is something that you desire and something you do and it is open to being judged by other people just like all the things that you desire and do are open to being judged by other people if I desire to steal something out of your store and I steal something out of your store you are allowed to say oh that was wrong you shouldn't do that you shouldn't desire you I can't you can't may not be able to help desiring it but you shouldn't do it you are allowed to judge what people do and that includes being gay we have discussions on the show and arguments on the show about the morality of being gay all the time that is an open discussion because people are doing things and when you do things you can be judged I have I do not I'm not without sympathy for people who are attracted to things that they cannot or should not have I think that must be a terrible terrible experience we know how powerful the sexual urges if you are attracted to children that is just I mean the the self-hatred and and compulsion must be terrible to deal with too bad too bad you got to deal with it you got to do the right thing you have to and if you don't you are it you are a monster it is not your identity it is something you want it is a se stitch a glitch in your system and something you want that you should not want and should not have and you should not be identify yourself with that that's what I have to say about it all right we'll be back tomorrow with the mailbag get your questions in so we can answer them and solve all your problems what do you need your problems for send them in we'll get rid of them I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show the Andrew Clavin show is produced by Robert Sterling
