Eric Erickson is a right-wing pundit and he's for reasons I'll explain it's like a bit of a beta male it's very threatened by strong women I don't know why you'd be threatened by strong women unless you're an incredibly weak man so let's get to the heart of this issue you have the choice of Karen handle a election in in Georgia six district a karen handel wins we start this off with jill philipovich who is a known feminist writer and she tweets out this statement after the election she says at what point is this not a failure of democrats but toxic vindictive voters willing to like hateful bigots now sure first karen handel is a bigot partly i imagine because she says that lesbians should not be able to adopt children noel there's a good case for bigoted there i actually disagree with Jill's analysis overall I think it is that loser Democrats lost this election I think that you could have found a way to fight harder in in that election and win okay but fine enough the perfectly acceptable political this disagreement there Eric Erickson didn't go in that direction here's what he said another reminder that feminists tend to be angry women jealous and other women's successes okay now first of all feminists want equal rights woman as that just as as men have them right same same rights as men okay so if you have those same rights there's no need to be angry and it's easy to you know do the stereotypes of shrill angry women right and missing the irony of that misogyny is is both a little amusing and amusing but if you don't have equal rights or you're not treated the same way well wouldn't you be angry I don't I would maybe I'm an excitable guy but if I was treated unfairly I'd be pretty angry too right now in in this case like karen handel for example wants to defund Planned Parenthood and she wants to criminalize abortion who wants to put women other women in jail now so for aircard sending to servers like him picked perfect I get to say I'm for a woman I'm sure I'm for women out for women who one take away rights from other women perfect see that a successful woman is one who works for us who works for our agenda okay now in reality do feminists want successful women of course that's the whole point of being a feminist is that you want the same rights they want women to be able to succeed just like men as long as they have the same rights they will right but now you say no they're against successful now the whole point of feminist movement is to be in favor of successful but if you're not in favor of women who want to take your body other women's rights ah you see that here get successful women okay by the way it's not just Erik Erikson it's many conservatives here's another conservative pundit Sean Davis he tweets there's no one a bitter feminist hates more than an independent woman who is more successful than she is no no no no like you see feminists talking about oh that you know business executive who's successful god I hate her no they applauded that there's a person in in medicine a really successful doctor Oh successful female doctors feminist Hatem on which planet on which planet right no they are against other women because they don't think like you you think men I protect many men your woman angry but kind of scared right they think hey if a guy could be a doctor who a woman should be allowed to be a doctor should a guy also be allowed to be a doctor of course not men versus women we just want the same rights and so they don't think that they hate her for being independent they don't like her for for her actual opinions they're judging her on the content of her character in her policies I know it's foreign to you because you like to group people and what race are they what gender are they and who do I hate all of them except me okay but arrogance is not the first time he's running to these issues he also got into trouble when he wrote an article called is your daughter a whore my guess is that if she is a woman and she is your daughter check but not our women our women are good they stay at home I mean they're successful they tell it we do they do exactly as we tell them I mean they're independent I'm sure they are that article apparently was actually about Halloween and how the outfits are too they turn on Eric too much okay for us males who are not threatened by strong women we believe they should have the same rights so I guess that would make us angry feminists for beta males who have issues with women then they are threatened oh my god feminists they want to say oh my god wake up smoking you just watch the video from the young turks did you know that there's a live to our show everyday and that if you're a member of the Young Turks you can get that on-demand anytime you want without ads plus the postgame just for members plus aggressive progresses plus old school plus so many other Network shows go right now TYT Network aam slash join
