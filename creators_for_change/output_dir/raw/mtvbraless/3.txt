1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Today's episode Decoded has nothing

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,170
to do with race, gender, or ethnicity,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,860
but, fellow able-bodied folks,

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,919
don't get too excited 'cause
we need to tighten up.

5
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:11,660
(lively, upbeat music)

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,400
As a woman of color, there are a lot

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
of phrases I'm tired of hearing.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,580
In fact, I made a whole video about them.

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,330
Oh, cute for a black guy.

10
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,860
That one kinda looks like you.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,790
But microaggressions like these
aren't just limited to race.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,540
So on today's episode of Decoded,

13
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,610
we're talking about five
things people living

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,550
with disabilities are tired of hearing,

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,180
reading, and seeing from
us able-bodied folks.

16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,720
And here to help us out is Danielle Perez.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,120
- Thanks, Franchesca.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,500
As an amputee, I can't speak

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,140
for every physically disabled person,

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,240
but across the spectrum
of physical disability,

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,980
there are some things we have in common.

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,660
And while this list of phrases could be,

23
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,690
like, 200 points long,
we've done you a favor

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,470
and trimmed it down to five.

25
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,490
Number one, how do you have sex?

26
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,700
People across the spectrum
of disability do indeed date.

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,370
We have romantic feelings,
romantic partners,

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,410
and yes, we (bleep).

29
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,834
The idea that sex must
be inherently painful,

30
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,680
sad, or shameful for disabled people

31
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,550
is an ill-informed stereotype

32
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,500
and one that assumes able-bodied people

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,230
are the only people whose
bodies can be desirable.

34
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,580
I'm fine as (bleep), and if you
can't see it, that's on you.

35
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,200
This stereotype tends to
disproportionately impact

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,520
physically disabled
folks, especially folks

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,430
who regularly use mobility
aids or wheelchairs like me!

38
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,640
And unless you're trying to
smash, mind your own business.

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,320
Number two, you don't look disabled!

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,880
Oh my God, this phrase is a hot mess.

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,730
Some people try to use this
phrase as a compliment.

42
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,780
It's not.

43
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,630
Don't erase our disability just

44
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,800
because it makes you feel better.

45
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,490
I've actually had people
tell me I'm too pretty

46
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,280
to be in a wheelchair.

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,210
Rude, I'm pretty and use a wheelchair.

48
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,450
It's important to remember the intent

49
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,640
doesn't always equal impact, which means

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,480
that even the best of intentions

51
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,350
can result in able-bodied people

52
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,400
speaking down to disabled folks.

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,180
Other people use you don't look disabled

54
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,920
as an accusation, which
what in the actual (bleep)?

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,350
Too often, able-bodied people assume

56
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,350
that disabilities you can't see are,

57
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,650
by nature, less serious
or entirely illegitimate.

58
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,620
Not every disability is visible.

59
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,060
Some people live with
invisible disabilities,

60
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,800
which includes people who
are deaf or hard of hearing,

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,660
and people living with chronic illnesses

62
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,130
that cause pain or fatigue.

63
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,670
But even people with physical disabilities

64
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,220
might not need mobile aids consistently.

65
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,710
Seeing someone in a wheelchair
stand up or use their legs

66
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,250
does not mean they
don't need a wheelchair.

67
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,600
Seeing someone with a
cane walking without it

68
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,540
doesn't mean they're
faking or exaggerating.

69
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,600
Y'all really think disabled people

70
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
aren't actually disabled and instead

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,929
are putting up their own
Showtime character special?

72
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:47,820
(buzzer buzzes)

73
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,590
We shouldn't have to prove we're disabled

74
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,810
in the first place, yet
we're constantly asked to,

75
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,440
which is why the phrase
you don't look disabled

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,240
has a particular sting to it.

77
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,110
Number three, I know someone
with your disability,

78
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,320
and something that helped them was...

79
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,900
People get heated when we
generalize about millennials.

80
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,020
We all will still assume every person

81
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,170
with a particular
disability will be helped

82
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,110
by this same exact thing.

83
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,270
Disability is not a monolith,
and it's not experienced

84
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,340
by every person in the same way.

85
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,070
So just 'cause your cousin
was helped by doing yoga

86
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,650
doesn't mean that's
helpful information for me.

87
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,020
You and your cousin are not my doctor,

88
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,740
unless it's Shelly, hey girl!

89
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,070
I don't mind talking about your friend

90
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,470
or neighbor who also
lives with X disability,

91
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,200
but don't assume that means
their lived experience

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,700
is similar to mine.

93
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,570
But also, I would much rather talk

94
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,140
about Cardi B coming for
Nicki Minaj's whole life

95
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,630
at New York Fashion Week.

96
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,680
'Kay, Team Cardi forever.

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,050
Number four, I was there
was a cure for you.

98
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,230
Not every disabled person
needs or wants to be cured.

99
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,130
We're people, not salami.

100
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,980
This mentality assumes
disability is a burden

101
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,530
and places the onus on disabled
people to fix themselves

102
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,930
rather than considering the ways we

103
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,480
as a society could make
our world more inclusive.

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
Our systems of education,
our infrastructure,

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,690
and our media are all catered

106
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,868
to serve the same types
of brains and bodies.

107
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:13,701
(buzzer buzzing)

108
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,940
When we focus on curing
rather than including,

109
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
it implies you'd rather change people

110
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,410
rather than infrastructure.

111
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,950
Inclusive design benefits everyone.

112
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,010
Do you really find it
threatening to live in a world

113
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,540
with more elevators and sidewalk cutouts?

114
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,360
Both of those things are
super useful to everyone.

115
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,270
Number five, I'm so sorry.

116
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,830
Disabled people are
people, and as YouTuber,

117
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,817
intersectional activist, and
my friend Annie Segarra writes,

118
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,557
"One does not need to be able-bodied

119
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:42,337
"or healthy in order to be happy.

120
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:44,507
"We can be sick or disabled and happy,

121
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:47,350
"and sad sometimes, just like you."

122
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,350
Yes, believe it or not, disabled people

123
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,990
also experience a range of emotions.

124
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,270
It's almost like we're human?

125
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,100
And fun fact, disabled people

126
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,760
are the largest minority
population in the US.

127
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,530
According to the US Census,
40 million Americans live

128
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,450
with a disability; it's normal.

129
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,430
So don't be sorry just because
someone has a disability.

130
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,790
Treat them like you would
any able-bodied friend

131
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,520
and save your sympathy for
when their goldfish dies

132
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,070
or they go viral on
Twitter for a bad take.

133
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,860
It happens to the best of us.

134
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,950
Anyway, I promise I'd limit
myself to five, and here we are.

135
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,960
Hopefully, we can get
an hour-long followup

136
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,190
for my backup list of
phrases I'm tired of hearing.

137
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,980
Kickin' it back to you, Franchesca.

138
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,860
- Thanks, Danielle.

139
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,250
And look, the truth is if
you've said any of these things

140
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,580
in the past, that doesn't
make you a terrible person.

141
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,080
We all make mistakes.

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,270
But now that you know
better, you can do better.

143
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,520
Problem solved.

144
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,530
And before we go, I just
wanna give a big thanks

145
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,680
to Danielle Perez.

146
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,300
And, as always, thanks for watching.

147
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,467
We'll see you next time
right here on Decoded.

148
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,340
(lively, upbeat music)

149
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,450
- I'm fine as (bleep).

150
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,800
I know I look good.

151
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,230
I'm all that and a bag of chips.

152
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,560
Are we still saying that,
does anyone have chips?

153
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,870
I'm sexy as hell.

154
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,660
I'm a dime on wheels,
okay, we call it a quarter.

155
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm a catch, and I know
because I'm on wheels

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:00:00,000
you don't think so, but
I'm very hard to catch.
