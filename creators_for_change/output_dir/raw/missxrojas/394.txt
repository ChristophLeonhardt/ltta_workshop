14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,120
the rest of the train ride was generally

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,310
uneventful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read a little wrote a</font>

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,260
little watched a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> but made me do</font>

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,210
what I always do in train rides stare

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,250
out the window there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,600
more interesting about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> countryside</font>

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,160
when seen from<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Raymond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a car i</font>

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,650
think distance was rendered tangible or

22
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,720

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,030
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the track is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set that I will</font>

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">always go to same distance as they were</font>

25
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,200
traveling along a limited string back

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,600
and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a tightrope walker but</font>

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,190
it's possible but the unexpected
