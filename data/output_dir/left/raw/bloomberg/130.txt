00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,800
Hey we are in front of a very special thing today

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,980
this is the east coast defender, defender 130 project viper

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,240
This is a very special custom truck

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,080
It's based off a 1986 Landrover Defender

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,560
costs about two hundred and eighty six thousand dollars

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,600
and it's meant to be able to scale a mountain

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,420
and look good going to dinner

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,300
so let's take a look

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,200
So this is pretty jacked up, this is not a low key SUV

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,780
this is really in your face truck

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,840
you kind of feel like you're in Mad Max

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,560
very furiosa style here

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,640
When East Coast Defender starts designing this for you, they literally say

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,760
what do you want us to do

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,480
and you can tailer things back based on price or functionality

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,760
but really the whole idea is that you kind of make your fantasy truck

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,180
They're only going to make ten of these per year

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,420
so if you are interested you gotta really get of it because it takes about a year to build one

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,540
and ten per year. Do the math

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,360
There aren't many that are gonna have this

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,520
So even though this car is a Defender, it actually has a lot of american components

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,820
and everything here was assembled in the US

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,400
so it's kind of cool that it's a british car but made in america

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,260
I will say though, the horn

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:00:00,000
Very british
