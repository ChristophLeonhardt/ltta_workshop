1
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:09,124
>> Tucker: WELCOME BACK TO

2
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,726
TONIGHT SPECIAL, INSIDE THE

3
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:11,627
ISSUES.

4
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:12,428
THE AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS

5
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,863
ORGANIZATIONS USE TO CARE ABOUT,

6
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:16,932
WELL, CIVIL RIGHTS, NO SURPRISE.

7
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:20,135
BUT RECENTLY THE NAACP HAS SAID

8
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:23,238
IT REGARDS CLIMATE CHANGE'S

9
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:28,243
CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE AND THAT

10
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:29,378
EQUALITY CANNOT BE ACHIEVED

11
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:31,246
WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,

12
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:32,448
WHATEVER THAT IS.

13
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:37,653
WE SPOKE WE SPOKE TO PORTIA

14
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:39,455
SHEPPARD ABOUT THIS.

15
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,457
SO, IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING

16
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,525
FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS, THE

17
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,427
MOST OBVIOUS IS, I AGREE WITH

18
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:48,030
BOTH GOALS, A CLEANING,

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,664
ENVIRONMENTAL AND RACIAL

20
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,032
EQUALITY, BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE

21
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:52,568
EXACTLY WHY THEY ARE TIED

22
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:52,935
TOGETHER.

23
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:53,869
HOW ARE THEY?

24
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:58,207
>> WELL I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

25
00:00:58,207 --> 00:00:59,908
NAACP BUT WHAT I CAN SPEAK FOR

26
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:01,043
IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE

27
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:03,445
THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE BLACK

28
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,080
BELT OF ALABAMA.

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,682
PART OF IT IS AS IT RELATES TO

30
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:09,084
WHAT DR. KING STOOD FOR, HE

31
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:11,253
STOOD FOR JUSTICE, AND STAND UP

32
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:13,088
FOR INJUSTICE THAT IS HAPPENING

33
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:14,256
IN ALL KINDS OF COMMUNITIES.

34
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:16,258
WHEN YOU LOOK HERE IN THE GREAT

35
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:17,559
STATE OF ALABAMA, IT'S NOT JUST

36
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,828
IN THE BLACK BELT OF ALABAMA, IT

37
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:23,399
JUST SO HAPPENS THAT IN LAWRENCE

38
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:24,133
JUST SO HAPPENS THAT IN LAWRENC

39
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:24,833
LAWRENCE COUNTY THEY ARE

40
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,034
EXPERIENCING THE SAME FIGHT AS

41
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:28,303
IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF

42
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:28,704
INJUSTICES.

43
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:31,039
IT HAPPENS IN OUR COMMUNITY, THE

44
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,242
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE FACING THESE

45
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:34,643
PROBLEMS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

46
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:37,246
>> Tucker: OKAY BUT BY THAT

47
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:38,046
STANDARD, COULD YOU SAY

48
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:39,248
MARTIN LUTHER KING FOUGHT FOR

49
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:40,249
JUSTICE, AND HE DID?

50
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:42,050
AND IS UNJUST FOR THE GOVERNMENT

51
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,185
TO TAKE MOST OF WHAT YOU HAVE

52
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,287
EARNED -- I THINK YOU AGREE THEY

53
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:46,755
SHOULDN'T TAKE MOST OF IT.

54
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:48,090
SO MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD BE

55
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,092
IN FAVOR OF LOWER TAX RATES.

56
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:51,093
BUT HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT LOWER

57
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,028
TAX RATES OR OF GLOBAL WARNING

58
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,863
SO MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GET HIM

59
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:59,501
INVOLVED IN THOSE ISSUES?

60
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:04,840
>> AS IT RELATES TO INJUSTICE,

61
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,241
THE LEGACY OF WHAT

62
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:08,043
DR. KING STOOD FOR, THAT'S THE

63
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:09,544
SAME MESSAGE THAT WE ARE SENDING

64
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:12,047
IN THE TOOLS WE ARE USING IN

65
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,048
THIS FIGHT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

66
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:13,382
JUSTICE.

67
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,050
WHEN YOU TIME AND TIME AGAIN

68
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,318
HAVE A COMMUNITY IS ESPECIALLY

69
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,221
IN BLACK BELT OF ALABAMA THAT

70
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:26,528
DON'T HAVE EQUITABLE SEWAGE, YOU

71
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,996
HAVE PEOPLE BEING POISONED.

72
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,065
YOU WOULD THINK THIS WOULD BE A

73
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,066
CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE BECAUSE A LOT

74
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,668
OF THE PEOPLE BEING AFFECTED ARE

75
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:33,168
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

76
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:36,538
SO IN THAT ASPECT OF IT, I CAN

77
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:37,439
DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT.

78
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,874
>> Tucker: I CAN SORT OF SEE

79
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:41,043
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, NO DOUBT

80
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,377
THAT POOR PEOPLE LIVE IN CRUMMY

81
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,745
OR PLACES AND THAT ARE MORE

82
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:44,546
POLLUTED.

83
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,848
BUT THERE ARE OBVIOUS REASONS

84
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:48,417
FOR THAT, SOME OF THEM SINISTER,

85
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,451
I AGREE.

86
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,386
BUT THE MOST POLLUTED PLACES ON

87
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:53,822
EARTH, THE UKRAINE WHERE THE

88
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:59,027
CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT HAPPENED,

89
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:01,930
IT'S NOT A RACIAL ISSUE BUT IT'S

90
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,365
A CONSPIRACY TO POLLUTE BECAUSE

91
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:04,433
OF SKIN COLOR.

92
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,102
IF WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE THAT'S

93
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:09,071
TRUE, WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T

94
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:10,038
SUGGEST IT, RIGHT?

95
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:12,140
>> I AGREE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,

96
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,843
BUT AS FAR AS A CLASS POINT, I

97
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:15,677
ABSOLUTELY AGREE.

98
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:18,413
THAT'S ONE REASON I BROUGHT UP

99
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:19,348
LAWRENCE AND MACON COUNTY.

100
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:21,683
THAT'S UP TO HIM PREDOMINATELY

101
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:22,484
WHITE COUNTY BUT THE MEDIAN

102
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,987
INCOME IS BETWEEN TEN AND

103
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,088
$17,000 PER YEAR.

104
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:27,289
YOU HAVE TO SAY THIS IS

105
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,690
DEFINITELY A POINT OF CLASS.

106
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,926
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE WANT TO

107
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:34,196
LIVE IN A POOR AREA BUT ME

108
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,430
PERSONALLY, I CAN TESTIFY FOR

109
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,865
MYSELF, I INHERITED LAND IN THAT

110
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:38,233
PARTICULAR AREA AND I'M NOT

111
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,302
GOING TO GIVE IT UP BECAUSE IT'S

112
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,070
A POOR AREA.

113
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,472
IT'S UNFAIR ESPECIALLY FOR THAT

114
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,439
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY, WHERE YOU

115
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,674
HAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE

116
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:46,642
WHO LIVE THERE THAT I OWNED THAT

117
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,877
LAND HAVE TO GIVE IT UP BECAUSE

118
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:49,845
YOU HAVE POLITICIANS AND PEOPLE

119
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,448
WHO ARE IN POWER WHO MAKE

120
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:54,683
DECISIONS WHO DUMP THESE

121
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:56,285
PARTICULAR ISSUES ON THEM.

122
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:57,553
THAT'S ONE OF THE PARTS THAT

123
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:00,422
BLACK BELT CITIZENS IS FIGHTING.

124
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,658
IT'S NOT SO MUCH, OH, IT CIVIL

125
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:04,226
RIGHTS, ITS BLACK POWER.

126
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,261
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT, IT'S ABOUT

127
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:06,962
HELPING PEOPLE STAND UP FOR

128
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,865
THEMSELVES AND GET THE JUSTICE

129
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,833
THAT THEY DESERVE.

130
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,635
THEY DESERVE CLEAN WATER.

131
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:15,137
MY MOM HAD NO BUSINESS BUYING

132
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,338
THREE OR FOUR CASES OF WATER PER

133
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:17,738
WEEK SO SHE COULD COOK A MEAL

134
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,207
BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID TO DRINK

135
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,709
THE WATER COMING OUT OF THE

136
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,043
FAUCET.

137
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,311
THOSE THINGS SHOULD NOT BE

138
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:23,045
HAPPENING.

139
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,413
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT WHEN

140
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,081
YOU TALK ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS

141
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:31,453
ISSUES, YOU SEE IT IN UNIONTOWN

142
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,055
ALABAMA, THESE ISSUES ARE

143
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:33,689
DEFINITELY TAKING PLACE.

144
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,857
IT JUST SO HAPPENED IN THAT

145
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:38,093
AREA, ITS PEOPLE OF COLOR BUT

146
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,928
IT'S DEFINITELY A CLASS ISSUE.

147
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,164
>> Tucker: I HAVE TO SAY, I

148
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:43,665
AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE

149
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:43,999
SAYING.

150
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,500
AND I HOPE THAT YOU DON'T SELL

151
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,469
YOUR LAND BECAUSE SOME OF THE

152
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:50,138
PRETTIEST PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY

153
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:52,841
ARE RURAL AREAS.

154
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:58,447
>> AND THEY ARE A LOT SAFER.

155
00:04:58,447 --> 00:04:59,414
[LAUGHS]

156
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:00,449
>> Tucker: SAFER AND NICE

157
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,049
PEOPLE.

158
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,217
BUT MAYBE THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE

159
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,453
IGNORE AND EXPLOIT RURAL

160
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:07,789
AMERICA, DID YOU EVER THINK OF

161
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:08,256
THAT?

162
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:08,857
>> ABSOLUTELY.

163
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,258
THAT GOES BACK TO THE CLASS

164
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:11,893
STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE EARLIER,

165
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,528
IT GOES RIGHT BACK TO THAT.

166
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:16,264
EVEN THOUGH I AM AND DURING THE

167
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:17,866
SAME STUFF THAT YOU ARE ENDURING

168
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,067
BUT I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

169
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,669
THAN YOU, I CAN FEEL LIKE I'M

170
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,671
ABOVE IT AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST

171
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:23,872
ISSUE OF THEM ALL.

172
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:26,675
THAT'S WHAT DR. KING WAS ABOUT.

173
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,477
THAT CAMPAIGN HE WAS GETTING

174
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:29,745
READY TO KICK OFF BEFORE HIS

175
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,747
ASSASSINATION, IT WAS FOR POOR

176
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:34,449
PEOPLE.

177
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,751
AND YOU SEE THAT TIME AND TIME

178
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,487
AGAIN, IT IS SPECIFICALLY IN

179
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,656
POOR COMMUNITIES, AND MORE THAN

180
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,858
LIKELY, PEOPLE OF COLOR WILL BE

181
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:43,358
AFFECTED BY THAT.

182
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:46,061
>> Tucker: I KIND OF AGREE

183
00:05:46,061 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
