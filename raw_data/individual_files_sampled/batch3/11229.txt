Russian President Vladimir Putin is on a trip across the Middle East his latest stop was Cairo where he met his Egyptian counterpart artis Ilya petrenko has more I liked when Vladimir Putin suddenly showed up in Syria a little earlier his Cairo trip was planned in advance but what kind of timing this is to squeeze in talks with both the presidents of Egypt and Turkey in Cairo and Ankara and here we're talking about a time frame of just several hours while Donald Trump's Jerusalem move really continues to send shockwaves across the entire Middle East and as Abdel Fattah al-sisi and Vladimir Putin were addressing the journalists here at the presidential palace in Cairo we heard more condemnation of that move as a silk we were discussing the Palestinian issue and especially the situation after the VA decided to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to there this reckless and provocative decision will have consequences that will influence the resolution of the conflict and the stability of the situation Egypt and Russia support Israel and Palestine resuming talks over all disputed issues they have including the status of Jerusalem a solid agreement that takes into account the interests of both sides should be reached we consider any action that anticipates the outcome of peace talks between Israel and Palestine counterproductive again this was being said in Cairo the Egyptian capital where it looks like the Arab League is ready to convene and come up with a united official response which will basically mean that it's a response from the entire region but even before this week a lot has been said in front of the microphones and in the streets they cannot oppose people's feelings and beliefs this is a new type of adventurism and global arrogance of the u.s. the Kingdom of Jordan refuses the recognition by the United States of Jerusalem is the capital of Israel the decision by the United States and its context gives legitimacy recognition for occupation and the the defect of status using fools indeed right now it is fair to say that not only the Arab world but a broader Islamic community is ready to stand up for the Palestinians so far the president of Turkey Tiber dawn turned out to be the most outspoken and here's what that led to we say Israel is a terrorist State I'm not used to receiving lectures about morality from a leader who bombs Kurdish villagers in his native Turkey who jails journalist who helps Iran go around international sanctions and who helps terrorists but back to Vladimir Putin Strip as I've said he's got one more destination on Monday and that is going to be Ankara where he will have face-to-face talks with type air Dewan after that we know that they are going to produce a joint statement as well so we'll be watching out for that
