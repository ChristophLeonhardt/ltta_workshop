REPORT WITH BRET BAIER. Bret: THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT, AND I'M BRET BAIER IN WASHINGTON. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SAYS THEN FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY WAS INSUBORDINATE DURING THAT HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION. THE REPORT ALSO REVEALS A TEXT MESSAGE IN WHICH ONE INVESTIGATOR TELLS ON FBI LAWYER THAT THEY WILL STOP DONALD TRUMP FROM GETTING ELECTED. BUT THE REPORT DOES NOT DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTE POLITICAL MOTIVES TO THOSE ACTIONS. JUST MOMENTS AGO, THE CURRENT DIRECTOR OF THE FBI PROMISED THAT PEOPLE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, BUT INSISTED NOTHING IN IN THE REPORT IMPG NOTHING IN IN THE REPORT IMPS THE INTEGRITY OF THE BUREAU AS A WHOLE. WE HAVE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE TONIGHT INCLUDING REACTION FROM TWO CHAIRMAN, TREY GOWDY AND BOB GOODLATTE. BUT LET'S BEGIN WITH CATHERINE HERITAGE AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TONIGHT. LOTS TO DIGEST. THE 500 PAGE REPORTS THAT IT WAS 17 MONTHS IN THE MACON ADDRESSES ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICAL BIAS AND FOUND THAT LORETTA LYNN SHOWED BAD JUST DON'T MAKE A JUDGMENT AND FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY WAS INSUBORDINATE. NO CHARGES ARE APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE. WHEN FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY GAVE HIS STATEMENT, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND COMEY WENT OUTSIDE THE CHAIN OF COMMAND WHEN HE INTENTIONALLY KEPT HIS BOSS, ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH AND HER DEPUTY, SALLY GATES, IN THE DARK. THEY FOUND IT WAS EXTRA NERI AND INSUBORDINATE FOR HIM TO DO SO, AND WE FOUND NO REASON FOR THE DEPRESSED WEEKS OF BASIS FOR DEVIATING FROM THE ESTABLISHED POLICY. IN A TWEET TO, COMEY RESPONDED. I RESPECT THE DOJ IG OFFICE WHICH IS WHY I URGE THEM TO DO THE REVIEW. THE CONCLUSIONS ARE REASONABLE EVEN THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH HIM. PEOPLE WITH GOOD FAITH CAN SEE AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION DIFFERENTLY. ON TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE, MICHAEL HOROWITZ FOUND IN A DOCUMENT DOCUMENTARY OR POLITICAL EVIDENCE FOR BIAS. IN A RECENT FOX INTERVIEW, COMEY SAID POLITICS PAID NO ROLE. I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM BUT I NEVER SAW ANY BIAS, AND A REFLECTION OF ANY KIND OF ANIMUS TOWARDS ANYBODY, EVEN ME. A TEXT MESSAGE RECOVERED LAST MONTH SUGGEST STRZOK MAY HAVE ACTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS. IN AUGUST OF 2016, PAGE ROAD, TRUMP IS NOT EVER GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT, RIGHT? RIGHT? AND HE REPLIED, NO, HE WON'T. WE WILL STOP IT. THEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMAILS WERE FOUND ON A COMPUTER. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SAID STRZOK DRAGGED HIS FEET AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN UNTIL TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION WHEN COMEY REOPENED THE EMAIL CASE. QUOTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE DID NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT STRZOK'S DECISION TO PRIORITIZE THE INVESTIGATION OVER THE LAPTOP WAS FREE FROM BIAS. BUT STRZOK'S ATTORNEY'S DISPUTE THAT SAYING THE DELAYS WERE CAUSED BY MISCOMMUNICATION. ON THE JUNE 2016 ARIZONA TARMAC MEETING BETWEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH AND BILL CLINTON, THE REPORT CONCLUDED LYNCH SHOWED BAD JUDGMENT WHICH IS TOOK THE MEETING AND FAILED TO RECOGNIZE AND TAKE ACTION TO GET THE VISIT SHORT WAS AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT. ON WHETHER THE CLINTON EMAILS CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WERE HACKED, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL UNCOVERED ON FBI REPORT WAS CONDUCTED AFTER THE ELECTION. THE CONCLUDED QUOTE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED BY UNAUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS WHO INCLUDED FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BY CYBER INTRUSION FROM ACCOUNTS LINKED TO CLIENT AND SERVER. WITHIN THE LAST HOUR WE HEARD FROM FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY WHO SAID HE ACCEPTS THE FINDINGS OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MISTAKES WERE MADE AND SAID THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES. THE REPORT DOES IDENTIFY ERRORS OF JUDGMENT, VIOLATIONS OF OR EVEN DISREGARD FOR POLICY AND DECISIONS THAT, AT THE VERY LEAST, WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT, WERE NOT THE BEST CHOICES. WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. FIRST, WE ARE GOING TO HOLD EMPLOYEES ACCOUNTABLE. ALSO DIRECTOR RAY EMPHASIZED THIS WAS A SINGLE INVESTIGATION AND A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES WERE
