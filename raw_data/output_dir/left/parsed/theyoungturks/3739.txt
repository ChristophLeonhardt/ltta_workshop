SO WE'VE HAD A RED WEDDING AND
WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNS OUT.
HE DIDN'T TURN OUT WELL, BUT
THERE ARE WEDDINGS THAT
TURN OUT GREAT.
RED WHITE AND BLUE WEDDINGS.
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?
I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS
ONE OF THE BEST WEDDINGS IN
AMERICA.
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE
VIDEO OF IT AND YOU ARE
GOING TO GO WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?
IT SEEMS INNOCUOUS ENOUGH.
LET ME SHOW YOU THE LOVELY
WEDDING HERE AND THEN I
WILL TELL YOU WHY THIS LOVELY
COUPLE I THINK DID SOMETHING
INCREDIBLY PATRIOTIC AND WHY I
WANT TO GIVE THEM CREDIT.
LET'S WATCH.
TODAY, IS ONE OF LIFE'S HAPPIEST
OCCASIONS.
BUT MARRIAGE INVOLVES MANY
EMOTIONS, GOOD AND NOT SO GOOD.
B EACH OTHER SUPPORT SYSTEM.
YOU WILL HAVE ALL OF US TO
LEAN ON AS WELL BUT ON A
DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, YOU WILL NEED
EACH OTHER.
LISTEN, BE PATIENT.
COMMUNICATE YOUR NEEDS.
AND DON'T FORGET THAT FRIENDSHIP
IS ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
FRIENDSHIP, LAUGHTER, AND LOVE.
THEY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT
LOOKS LIKE A LOVELY BUT
FAIRLY NORMAL WEDDING.
WRONG.
THOSE AMERICAN HEROES ARE JUSTIN
HAYASHI AND REBECCA CHAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID TO THEIR
GUESS?
THEY SAID DON'T GIVE US ANY
GIFTS.
INSTEAD, PLEASE GIVE AT
WOLF-PAC.COM/WEDDING.
I AM NOT KIDDING.
THEY ASKED EVERY GUEST TO GIVE
TO WOLFPAC INSTEAD.
HOW MUCH DO I LOVE THESE GUYS?
THEY GOT NO GIFTS FOR THEIR
WEDDING.
ALL THEY GOT WAS PEOPLE GIVING
TO A CAUSE THAT THEY REALLY
BELIEVE IN WHICH IS TO OF COURSE
GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS SO WE
ENDED THE CORRUPTION IN THIS
COUNTRY SO PEOPLE ARE JUST
REPRESENTED BY THE ELITE ANYMORE
BUT THAT THE AMERICANS CAN HAVE
A TRUE VOICE AND SO I WAS MOVED
BY THAT.
THEY VISITED HERE AS WELL AND I
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE
NOT ONLY THINK THEM BUT TAKE IT
UP A NOTCH.
SO THEY'VE ARTIE RAISED
THOUSANDS FOR WOLFPAC BUT
CAN I SEE HUNDRED THOUSAND?
HOW AMAZING WOULD THAT BE IF IT
TURNED OUT THERE WEDDING
REGISTRY RAISED $100,000 FOR AN
AMAZING CAUSED UP BY THE WAY, A
CAUSE THAT 93%
OF AMERICANS AGREE WITH 93%
OF AMERICANS SAY THAT
POLITICIANS REPRESENT THEIR
DONORS OVER THERE VOTERS AND
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
ABOUT THAT BUT COULD YOU IMAGINE
CARING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT TO MAKE
THAT THE FOCUS OF YOUR WEDDING,
AT LEAST HER WEDDING REGISTRY?
WHAT WONDERFUL THOUGHTFUL
PEOPLE.
WOLFñPAC.COM/WEDDING.
GO DONATE TO NOT JUST THEIR
CAUSE BUT TO THEIR WEDDING
AND TO THEIR LOVELY GESTURE.
JUSTIN AND REBECCA, WONDERFUL
JOB DONE FACT, WOLFPAC GOT
TOGETHER AND THEY WANTED TO
THINK THEM AT THEIR LATEST
GATHERING SO THIS IS SOME OF THE
STATE LEADERS AND I WANT TO
SHOW YOU THEIR THANK YOU.
THANK YOU REBECCA AND JUSTIN!
I LOVE AMERICA.
I LOVE AMERICANS.
THIS IS
WHAT WE DO TOGETHER SO MAKE
IT A SPECIAL ONE.
MAKE IT THE MOST SPECIAL WEDDING
THAT ANYONE'S EVER HAD.
THANK YOU GUYS FOR DOING THAT BY
THE WAY, IF YOU WANT TO DO IT
TOO, I KNOW IT'S A BIG THING AND
THAT'S WHY IT'S BOLD AND THAT'S
WHY THEY ARE GREAT.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A WEDDING,
IT COULD BE A QUINCEANERA.
IT COULD BE A BAR MITZVAH.
I DON'T KNOW.
TOGETHER@WOLFñPAC.COM IF YOU
WANT TO DO THIS AS WELL.
LET WOLFPAC KNOW AND THEY WILL
SET IT UP FOR YOU.
LIKE I SAID, GO TO
WOLFñPAC.COM/WEDDING AND DONATE
TO
THIS GREAT AMERICAN COUPLE'S
WEDDING AND TO THEIR CAUSE.
LET'S GET AN AMENDMENT, LET'S
MAKE IT WORTHWHILE.
COULD YOU IMAGINE, WE PASS
THAT AMENDMENT AND THEY GET TO
SAY HEY, WE WERE A HUGE PART
OF IT, AND THAT WOULD BE
ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
CAN I SEE A HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS IN THEIR WEDDING
REGISTRY?
