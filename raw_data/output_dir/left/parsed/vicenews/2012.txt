this week on the business of life we
travel to chicago to investigate the way
we eat in the span of just a few
generations americans have become
obsessed with the way we eat but despite
this increased attention to what we put
into our bodies America is still the
most obese nation on earth so we're
thinking about food in different ways
but are we thinking about it in the
right ways everything you need to know
about the food industry broken down
through facts and figures by the
smartest people in the room food has
always been open source I don't have to
pay a licensing fee to the Earl of
Sandwich every time I make PB&J this is
the business of life
