guys we are sitting here I'm sitting
with my best friend in the entire world
I'm a freaking zombie right now we just
got one hour massages both of us and I
feel like gummy bear dude I think she
sent my shoulders and Nick was so bad
she wants to see me again before I go on
tour which is like less than a week one
week if you never went got a massage I
recommend it man it makes you feel so
much better and not only that you
actually have knots in your back then
they can work out especially if you ride
bike skateboard you do activities mine
was from falling on Dale's parachute
crack instantly a man just you hang from
the ceiling like a bat it would actually
probably be really good on my back I
think Brittany has planned a date day we
have a date today and she planned it and
I have no idea what we're doing
no hands okay we can film it and
everything like that really she can tell
me where to go I have no idea where
we're going which is kind of fun it's
kind of a mystery we need to go from
what do you tell me that before I think
about it no just now about powerful
this looks like an abandoned warehouse
are you are you doing you try to kill me
take me out this is really open yeah
so here we are Brittany picked two
things to do today one is go-karting
rip it Oh go-karting these laces usually
are hard to film like really hard to
them last time no one I did this one
time and they film for me so maybe nice
maybe the hub speed her speed
that's terrible man in my old video game
days back when I played SOCOM online all
the time guess what my name was Hemi
Hemi HTMI that was my name on video
games Hemi I never had any wheel this is
the perfect day to come here nobody's
here I think we honestly have this place
to ourselves like best day to come ever
this is the blindfold no open-toed shoes
including change iOS flip-flopped we
require its five back safety traffic
safety gear shoe rental is available at
the retail counter best safety I need it
I know I dropped it no it's not
I was gonna be awesome I'm gonna smoke
you that said no punishing you just
watch the safety video no crashing
so there's no way we can film this which
really stinks Britney says maybe we need
a GoPro today we're gonna have fun
off-camera for 12 minutes it's a 12
minute ride or I can film them whoa
you're gonna flip yours no you're not
anything with wheels you pretty much
suck that yes at the truck drove the
truck just fine just due to do and
here's imagine having this in your
garage look at that
they never come out you never come out
small
screams on the future ego
I think you'd be a small
like light bulb
it looks good is it fit gun let's see
that's good
you should add some grace
I'm going red
it's good
you gotta adjust it
your agent I think he can go further
you got three that really good number
one you were fast yes I think you passed
me once
all right speedy Britt took third count
Trump Trump alone who's that that's me
no nice did I started slow first few
laps yeah so but then there was no
catching me I was gone that was a lot of
fun I wish i
okay good con so fun I tried to fall out
the camera why did you see me it was so
bad I'm actually really surprised I took
first place that's right I mean I was I
was that's good there's only three
people on the track so you can get
beside me we uh we had such a good that
was fun and I didn't wreck it all did
you wreck yeah I started slow but then I
just found wait I gave it up all I get
well we're just sitting here in the car
watching the quick shot I filmed on the
I couldn't steer with one hand on that
go-kart it's so fast but you can see for
a split second Brittany wrecked somebody
right behind we take the turns boom
I didn't break in
I didn't hit two other people to her
blood out there I wish we had a face cam
on you while you erase it I bet it was
so like I wish we could read your mind
I'm gonna get yelled at a couple times
welcome to Columbus Brittany overshot
our time she thought we're gonna be at
the go-kart place for a long time so
we're actually gonna grab lunch with
Carl and Tim right now right yeah that's
the plan yeah and then we have one more
thing if brittany hasn't told me about
she wants to tell me I just she says I'm
not gonna want to go why would you plan
something I don't want to do I want to
do it they don't want to do it happy
wife is a happy life it always feels so
good to be downtown and I love being
downtown
let's move downtown no dirt bikes no
fireworks pretty much everything that's
a long time we're like country people
wait I don't know if I left my car I
didn't even get my keys how did we get
my key
oh it's not locked that could have been
so bad
whoo new cars make it difficult to lock
your own keys in your car but I hate
doing that I've done it before
busted I got you we're gonna eat a
little place downtown we used to go
called the elevator I love this place
it's really cool that they're the ones
they're the ones that have the hot rock
you can cook your own food on like your
steaks your fish and it's fun
I don't even have to look how long do
you think it takes to do all that floor
look at that ten minutes take longer
than that minecraft I'm just gonna say
this right now I've had already and we
haven't like we've got it started and I
just found out what we're doing after
this the pretty thought I wouldn't want
to do I guess it I'm so excited
just tell him she's not that is the
meanest thing no you know before you
guys got here I said I said let's hide
the camera and talk like we were me like
not to mean and she did it she was like
I don't know how to react that's so real
it's the meanest friend Carl Tamara here
no you really are
now you're just like you're perfect like
nobody knows everybody knows
so speaking of Tim how long you got
you're like a month away Carl in there
see what you did I am beyond excited to
see you guys with your firstborn
he's so awesome I'm pump it's gonna be
awesome you dude why do I eat so much
food too much so we start talking like
on tamper ever in
two hours were definitely best the meter
is read do we have a ticket
no ticket so lucky high five
it sounds really fun like I'm totally
about it yeah it's nice up no I guess
what number two was she playing two
things today
I guess what the second one was I'm
excited she thought it was I was not
gonna be excited I think it sounds great
just like at the go-kart track maybe
just like it the go-kart track
baseball this is always a fun date night
fun time for the family we learn about
like sports I don't even really watch
baseball but it's was fun
you think you could throw this fast
here's what I learned about baseball so
far nobody comes here to watch the game
everyone comes here to eat drink and
hang out like it's a social some people
flip out when they drop stuff on them
I've never done that I just wipe it we
had a good time what is your favorite
sports from watch like live Britney said
baseball I really like hockey I would
say football just because there's so
much going on there's so much action
there's always people hitting people
there's so much going on baseball's
we're like golf like you have to wait so
long for anything exciting that's my
opinion anyway we had a good time place
is still going we left a little early
but that's how you get out without
that's not we're not we're not sports
fans so you leave early you avoid all
the traffic we're not missing anything
so in the past few vlogs I've been
showing you guys that I go to Twitter
everybody that retweet stuff I just hit
the retweet button just like this let me
show you I literally go to random tweets
that I have posted and I click on
retweets and then here all that randomly
throughout every day I literally every
single person that retweets I go

to go to a different tweet so thank you
