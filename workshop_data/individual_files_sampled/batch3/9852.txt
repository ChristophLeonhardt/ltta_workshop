JESSE: WELCOME TO "WATTERS WORLD." GETTING PLAYED FOR A CHUMP BY DONALD TRUMP. AFTER LITTLE ROCKET MAN BAD MOUTHED VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND FAILED TO PREPARE FOR THE SUMMIT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WITH JOHN KERRY SHOULD HAVE DONE. HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I DECIDED TO TERMINATE THE PLANNED SUMMIT ON JUNE 12. MANY THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY LIES AHEAD POTENTIALLY. I BELIEVE THIS IS A TREMENDOUS SETBACK FOR NORTH KOREA AND INDEED A SETBACK FOR THE WORLD. FAN WHEN KIM JONG-UN CHOOSES TO ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE AND ACTIONS, I AM WAITING. JESSE: POTUS SENT THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER A LETTER WHICH READ, YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES. BUT OURS ARE SO MASSIVE AND POWERFUL I PRAY TO GOD THEY WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE USED. I FELT A WONDERFUL DIALOGUE WAS BUILDING UP BETWEEN YOU AND ME. AND ULTIMATELY IT'S ONLY THAT DIALOGUE THAT MATTERS. SOME DAY I LOOK HAVE MUCH FORD TO MEETING YOU. IN THE MEANTIME I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES. THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE. INCREDIBLE LETTER AND CLASSIC ART OF THE DEAL. TRUMP NEVER LOCKED IN. PRESIDENT TRUMP: IF THE MEETING HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS. IF IT DOESN'T, WE GO ON TO THE NEXT STEP. THERE ARE CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT WE WANT. AND I THINK WE'LL GET THOSE CONDITIONS. IF WE DON'T, WE'LL HAVE A MEETING. SO THE PRESIDENT GAVE UP NOTHING WHILE THE NORTH KOREANS DESTROYED THEIR NUCLEAR TESTING FAT SILT, COMMITTED TO END THE KOREAN WAR AND RELEASED AMERICAN HOSTAGES. TRUMP PULLS OUT AND KIM IS PUT IN HIS PLACE. BUT THE LEFT SEES ONLY A WIN FOR KIM. I THINK IT'S WIN FOR KIM JONG-UN. WHEN HE GOT THIS LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT SAYING NEVER MIND, HE MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE FIT. THE PRESIDENT WAS REHEARSING THE END ZONE DANCE AND WE ARE NOT EVEN AT THE 50 YARD LINE. JESSE: WHEN THE PRESIDENT SCHEDULED THE SUMMIT THE LEFT SAID KIM WON. WHEN THE PRESIDENT PULLED OUT, THE LEFT SAID KIM WON. THEY SAY KIM JONG-UN'S SISTER WAS A BETTER DIP MATTED THAN IVANKA. IN THE COURSE OF THIS PRESIDENCY, DEMOCRATS HAVE DEFENDED HAMAS, MS-13, IRANIAN MULLAHS, WATERBOARD TERRORISTS, RISKY SYRIAN REFUGEES AND ANTIFA. TRUMP'S SUCCESS HAS BOXED DEMOCRATS INTO SUCH RADICAL POSITIONS THEY ARE BECOMING POLITICALLY IRRATIONAL. NOW THE KOREANS SIGNALING THEY WANT THE MEETING BACK ON. PRESIDENT TRUMP: WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IT WAS A NICE STATEMENT THEY PUT OUT. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IT COULD BE THE 12th. WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW. WE ARE GOING SEE WHAT HAPPENS. JESSE: CLEARLY THE NORTH KOREANS
