recently our two IT investigates team had reported that the Democratic Party specifically the d-triple-c had essentially pressure Democratic candidates in primary elections to sign unity agreements and now there is a specific candidate who apparently is in line with Bernie Sanders and his policy ideas who really questioned and felt uncomfortable about these unity demands now TYT investigates spoke to two individuals who are familiar with this candidate and his feelings about it they did not speak to the candidate himself but I do want to give you the findings of their story so Doug Applegate is the candidate that they reported on he ran against Darrell Ison 2016 and lost very narrowly by a point six percent margin and was one of the Democratic hopefuls to receive a d-triple-c memo of understanding asking them to agree to forswear attacks that might hurt their rivals in the general election and to attend a unity event with their rivals after their primaries so that's who it is Applegate said that he was in line with all the issues and the core values of Bernie Sanders's campaign he has been endorsed in his 2018 campaign by the National Nurses United group and also they were a major advocate for Bernie Sanders during his primary campaign so you could understand why he might feel a little uncomfortable agreeing with this unity demand from establishment Democrats so there's three components that Michael Tracy reported on earlier which I brought to you on the show and now this is the update that we've got a Democratic candidate that looks like he's not gonna sign before I get to those components I just want to be clear about this TYT investigates those objective reporting and they are not connected to just Democrats I'm connect through the Justice Democrats all of our hosts key to have different opinions my opinion is just Democrats are awesome but I did not participate in this at all if I had I think I could have just got Applegate to talk to them but anyway they do this independently so they apparently talked to two staffers and I don't know who they are but that's a what's great reporting and and there might be more what I understand is there might be more Democratic candidates who will not sign it okay so now what are the three components one is after the primary everybody hug it out I think that's the least offensive but I still wouldn't sign that because I don't know did he do dirty tricks the D at the primary hasn't happened yet right if we were in a normal campaign we were policy differences that's fine like as I said on the show the other day what if it was the 2000 primary between McCain and Bush and Bush is saying McCain has an illegitimate black daughter I'm not gonna hug it out with that guy right so okay second so but that's the least problematic second one is wanna animation which is promised not to attack your primary opponents no no I don't promise that because that helps the incumbents yeah because they already have a huge advantage that also helps people who have super PACs because the super PACs can attack anyone they like but candidates without PACs for example the Justice Democrats who don't take corporate PAC money don't have super PACs well then they unilaterally disarm oh what a funny coincidence the d-triple-c has found a way to disarm progressives who are not corrupted by corporate PACs so I understand what the point of primaries are if you're not allowed to run against the incumbent like what is the point of primaries yes I mean like this you know like they say all the time politics is bean bag ain't bean bag if they want to make it Bing bag it when it comes to progressives right stand down right and and like the steak Applegate's race Applegate had the closest race in the whole country barely lost the ice em and and now eisah is losing by 10 points in that race okay so Applegate is the clear front-runner he's actually raised a ton of money that's usually excuse they have of you didn't raise enough money no he used small donors to raise nearly a million bucks Applegate is the clear leader if the Democrats actually cared about winning there was one of the guy who almost beat him last time as a 10-point lead has nearly a million bucks clear it's for obvious but they're not and so there's two other or three other people in the race one of them is a bundler for the Clinton 2016 campaign oh don't attack them be nice don't attack them be nice don't bring that up don't yet am I allowed to say that he was a Hillary Clinton bundler or is that some sort of I'm Michael Levin is your be invoking in other words Sarah Jacobs I don't know if I'm allowed to sign this say this if I sign that the triple C letter she's the granddaughter of Qualcomm founder Urban Jacobs sure she's financing your own campaign she's got a lot of money Democrats love rich people the Democratic Party right let's go you you've got money to finance your campaign oh you're ducking you better not criticize ur right and then there's another real estate investor in the race so it's like three enormous ly rich people against Applegate and they won't Applegate to sign a letter and I've been talking about this at all so I don't you know this is Michaels reporting it will get applicated on the show hopefully one day we'll ask him directly but they ask Applegate to sign the letters saying don't attack them don't say where they're getting their money who they support insanity no no we don't I wouldn't agree that under any circumstances and I haven't even gotten to what I think is the worst part the worst part is the candidates must allocate 75% of their funds that's reward paid communications doesn't it's that's it largely TV it doesn't have to be just TV but you have to spend it in advertising why why can't I spend all of my money on humans I want to go knock on every door in the district I'm gonna use 75% of my money on volunteers no you're not allowed to do that why why do you care you cared because actually these DNC d-triple-c a run not by the politicians by the consultants and they're all gonna get 25 percent 15 to 25 percent on all those ads you must funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to moss otherwise we're not we're gonna cut you off and as Michael reports and TYT investigates and this follow-up story there could be consequences if they don't sign not only could they lose funding from the d-triple-c support at the national level maybe lose access to voter rolls but then all the Allied groups all the the pen groups in Washington DC the big so-called progressive groups that have the same exact donors on their boards then they cut you off the good enough that's it okay these people are illegitimate it's almost as if they learned absolutely nothing from the general election instead of taking ownership of the flaws that that occurred during the 2016 election they're just finding ways to squash any and all objections or opponents and it's not it will not bode well even if they're able to do away with these opponents and hide their message and basically squash them people are aware of what's going on and and this is a really really bad idea strategically so by the way if you want to support Doug that's your call I'm supporting him I think he's gonna win I think he's gonna be a great great congressman so be wonderful to get rid of one of the most loathsome guys in Congress and darrell Issa with a real strong progressive he's a colonel it's a marine just Democrats calm slash Doug and Applegate for congress.com we'll have those links in the description box below in the comment section on Facebook and and but Anna to your point they we have different priorities we want progressives to win the consulting class that runs the Democratic Party doesn't care if they win they just want the money so if it turns out eisah wins because they screwed up this race doesn't matter as long as the 75% of the money goes to them it doesn't next time they'll get 75% of the money to lose again who cares as long as they get the money right whereas if progressives win and they do not agree to funnel 75% of the money to them to them that's a giant loss who cares who won the race progressive policies it couldn't care less they don't care at all so we just we keep thinking that they're bungling things no like like oh my god they don't know how to win no winning for them is completely different than winning for us Nancy Pelosi said about a year ago that the people don't want change she said that on CBS she said people don't want change she was the one who picked the chairman of the d-triple-c Ben ray Lujan is a Shanna's out hey say his name doesn't matter how you say his name he was handpicked by Nancy Pelosi and what is his job his job is to silence progressives and that's what this is this is about keep the Money Train going as genk says and tell progresses to shut up and they don't have a plan actually this isn't the D triple C's plan to get voters this is the D triple C's plan to protect corporatists that's all this is and when they asked Nancy Pelosi why should you stay in charge for for the House Democrats she said I'm a master legislature is okay yeah she literally said yes and I then they said okay why and she said because I raise the most amount of money how is that legislate thats not legislating at all that's nice there's no lies as almost no legislative wins ever ever but she raised the most amount of money and then funnels a lot of it to her consultant friends will get really really rich off the money by the way sometimes from rich donors but sometimes from small donors that money also gets funneled to those consultants that's why when we say no more corporate PACs they lose their minds they view us as the enemy way more than they view the Republicans as the enemy if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be
