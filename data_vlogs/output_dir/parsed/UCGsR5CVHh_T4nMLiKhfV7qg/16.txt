back at the hotel and CJ was sleeping
over but now he not asleep anymore my
dad tell y'all a little funny story I
couldn't catch on camera so I was just
like on my phone or whatever and I
looked up and there was this little
horse and carriage think that one kid
could sit in and then one kid could pull
it oh nice little fun and so I looked up
if CJ was sitting in a horse and
carriage thing right and then I looked
over and it was a girl pulling him
around so I got my little potato head
butt up and I went over there and I was
like no no no CJ I said you get out this
car and she get in the car and you Talib
and I made him or her around in the
horse and carriage because you got teach
them from a very young age all you guys
start them off young but the everybody
have no girl taking care of you you
anybody have no girl um
doing all this stuff you have to take
care of the girl you have to be a
gentleman we have to open doors for her
you have to pull her around and horse
the carriage that feel job that's not
her job so anyway that was just a little
little cute story I thought was cute
because um I'm like trying to teach him
how to like you know just be a gentleman
at a young age so that when he get older
all of this stuff will click in his head
he might not really understand it right
now cuz the only three but he'll
understand it when you get older and
he'll be like I remember when my mommy
told me to open the door for her and
hold it open and do this and do that so
I'm just trying to teach him how to be
you know man and that's that's what men
do they're polite and they treat women
with respect you know I'm trying to
teach CJ right CJ
right okay stay right stay right why you
gotta open the door for girl because
it's nice
say I'm a gentleman ah yeah you could be
hot but you gotta be gentleman first say
I'm a gentleman about to pull up to the
studio and finish war cry then when you
come back to the hotel but asleep
