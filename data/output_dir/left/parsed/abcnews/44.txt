TEACHER'S DESK.
THE LITERALLY WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE 
OF YOUR CLASS.
>> HE WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF YOUR 
CLASS?
DID YOU SEE HIM?
>> YES, UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T 
GET TO SEE HIM.
I LITERALLY RAN TO THE DOOR.
I LITERALLY HEARD THE SHOTS.
AND THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE 
DEAD.
TWO RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DOOR.
>> THREE PEOPLE DEAD OUTSIDE 
YOUR DOOR.
AND INSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL?
>> NO, THREE PEOPLE DEAD, I 
THINK IN THE SCHOOL.
TWO OUTSIDE MY DOOR.
>> TWO OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR.
>> LITERALLY FEET OUTSIDE MY 
DOOR.
FEET OUTSIDE MY DOOR.
>> YOU HEARD THE SHOTS.
ABOUT HOW MANY SHOTS DID YOU 
HEAR?
>> TOO MANY TO COUNT.
>> DID IT SOUND LIKE AUTOMATIC 
WEAPONS FIRE LIKE A MACHINE GUN?
>> IT SOUNDED MORE LIKE A PISTOL
THAN A SHOTGUN.
>> DID YOU HEAR ANY TALKING BY 
THE SHOOTER?
>> NO, I JUST HEARD SCREAMING 
FROM PEOPLE BEING SHOT, INJURED.
MAYBE PEOPLE DYING.
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
>> SO, THIS WAS, YOU SAY, RIGHT 
OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR.
WHAT DID YOU DO ONCE YOU HEARD 
THE SHOTS?
WERE YOU LOCKED INSIDE THE ROOM?
>> YES, THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
ALL THE STUDENTS GOT LOW TO THE 
GROUND.
WE GOT TO WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE 
INSIDE THE DOOR.
AND ALL ROUGHLY 20 STUDENTS WERE
SITTING UNDERNEATH THE DESK WITH
MY TEACHER. 
>> YOU WERE SITTING UNDERNEATH 
THE DESK.
WERE YOU ABLE TO BARRICADE THE 
DOOR?
>> NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH 
TIME.
FORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE TEACHERS
THAT IS VERY STRICT, STRICTLY 
ENFORCES THE POLICY AT MY 
SCHOOL, THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED TO 
KNOW WITH AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS 
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS NOW.
>> SO, YOU'VE HAD DRILLS FOR A 
SITUATION LIKE THIS IN THE PAST?
>> NOT ANY DRILLS BUT 
INFORMATION TOLD ON US.
AND ACTUALLY, RIGHT WHEN WE CAME
BACK FROM WINTER BREAK, SO, NOT 
EVEN A MONTH AGO, TELLING US 
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IN CASE THIS 
WOULD EVER HAPPEN.
>> AND IT'S NOW 3:20.
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT TIME THIS
HAPPENED?
WHAT TIME YOU HEARD THE SHOTS?
>> SO, AT AROUND 2:20, 2:25 IS 
WHEN IT STARTED.
AND I'D SAY IT PROBABLY ENDED 
AROUND 2:30.
POLICE WERE AT OUR DOOR BY 2:45.
>> THAT'S ABOUT 25 MINUTES RIGHT
THERE.
THIS IS STILL BEING DESCRIBED AS
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION.
HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD ANYTHING 
ABOUT THE SHOOTER, WHERE HE OR 
SHE MIGHT BE?
>> NO.
AND YOU'RE STILL IN THE 
CLASSROOM?
>> NO.
WE HAD POLICE INVADE THE SCHOOL.
AND WE WERE TAKEN OUT, 
BASICALLY, EVACUATED.
FORTUNATELY, MY FATHER WAS THERE
TO PICK ME UP AT THE MOMENT.
AND I LEFT AND EVACUATED TO MY 
HOUSE WHERE I'M AT CURRENTLY.
>> SO, YOU'RE IN YOUR HOUSE 
RIGHT NOW.
SO, YOU'RE SAFE RIGHT NOW.
>> YES.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY
PEOPLE WERE LEFT IN THE SCHOOL 
WHEN YOU LEFT?
>> PLENTY.
HUNDREDS.
HUNDREDS.
MAE CLOSE TO A COUPLE 
THOUSAND.
>> BECAUSE THERE'S ABOUT 3,000 
PEOPLE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL, 
RIGHT?
>> YES, MAYBE EVEN MORE.
THERE WAS DEFINITELY -- WE WERE 
THE FIRST ONES OUT.
WE WERE THE CLOSEST TO THE 
PARKING LOTS.
>> YOU SAY THE FIRST SHOTS WERE 
IN THE PARKING LOT?
>> NO, WE'RE HERE, BUT WE'RE 
CLOSE TO THE PARKING LOT.
>> YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE PARKING 
LOT.
THE FIRST SHOTS, AS FAR AS YOU 
KNOW, WERE OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.
YOU SAID YOU SAW TWO BODIES 
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF YOUR 
CLASSROOM?
>> YES, RIGHT AFTER WE WERE 
EVACUATING I SAW TWO DEAD 
BODIES.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE 
THE SHOOTER WENT AFTER THAT?
>> I HEARD SHOTS COMING FROM 
NEXT DOOR.
THEN A COUPLE MORE MORE DOWN.
AFTER THAT, I HEARD FOOTSTEPS 
ABOVE US IN THE SECOND FLOOR.
AND FROM THERE, I CAN'T TELL 
YOU.
>> RIGHT.
SO, YOU SAY THE POLICE GOT THERE
ABOUT 25 MINUTES AFTER THE 
SHOOTING BEGAN.
CAN YOU ESTIMATE AT ALL -- YOU 
SAID THERE WERE TOO MANY SHOTS 
TO COUNT AS WELL.
CAN YOU ESTIMATE AT ALL HOW LONG
THE SHOOTING WENT ON?
ABOUT HOW MANY MINUTES? 
>> I'D SAY MAYBE CLOSE TO 3 1/2,
4 MINUTES FROM WHAT I COULD 
HEAR.
FROM WHERE I COULD HEAR IT.
>> RIGHT.
BUT THE SHOOTER WAS, AS FAR AS 
YOU COULD TELL, WAS ALSO MOVING?
>> YES.
>> AND HAVE YOU BEEN IN CONTACT 
WITH ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS FROM 
INSIDE THE SCHOOL?
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.
AS SOON AS I GOT OUT AND I SAW 
MY FRIENDS IT WAS ONE OF THE 
MOST EMOTIONAL TIMES I'VE EVER 
EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.
SEEING MY FRIENDS SAFE.
ON THE WAY HOME, I WAS CHECKING 
MY PHONE.
AND I JUST SEEN SO MANY MESSAGES
OF PEOPLE JUST TEXTING AND 
CALLING.
AS ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, 
PEOPLE ARE CALLING.
I'M PRETTY SURE A LOT OF MY 
FRIENDS ARE SAFE, YES.
>> YOU THINK MOST OF YOUR 
FRIENDS ARE SAFE.
DID YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS, YOU 
FOUND, YOU SAW OUTSIDE YOUR 
CLASSROOM, THE VICTIMS?
>> PARDON ME?
>> DID YOU KNOW THE VICTIMS 
OUTSIDE YOUR CLASSROOM?
>> NO, I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK.
>> WE'RE WATCHING, THIS IS STILL
A LIVE PICTURE.
WE'RE STILL SEEING MORE OF THE 
STUDENTS EVACUATED RIGHT NOW.
PEOPLE WALKING OUT WITH THEIR 
HANDS UP.
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR TEACHER KNEW
WHAT TO DO IN THE MOMENT?
>> YES.
>> AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE 
BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TEXT FROM 
ANY OF YOUR CLASSMATES OR FROM 
ANYBODY ELSE AT THE SCHOOL, HAVE
YOU PICKED UP ANY MORE 
INFORMATION FROM THE TEXTS FROM 
YOUR CLASSMATES, ANY MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE 
INJURED OR VICTIMS? 
>> I GATHER, A COUPLE TEACHERS I
KNOW FOR SURE, ARE INJURED.
I GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S TWO 
DEAD, TWO DOWN ON THE FLOOR.
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT ONE OF MY 
CLOSE FAMILY FRIENDS' SON HAD 
BLOOD ALL OVER HIM.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HIS NAME.
I CAN'T THINK OF IT AT THE 
MOMENT.
AND AS FAR AS EVERYBODY IN MY 
CLASS WHO ELSE.
>> AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE 
ANSWER TO THIS, CAN YOU TELL IF 
IT WAS ONE OR MORE THAN ONE 
SHOOTERS?
>> I HONESTLY CAN'T TELL YOU 
THAT.
I HAVE NO IDEA.
BUT IT'S NOT -- I DON'T THINK IT
WAS MULTIPLE -- OR ANYTHING, A 
SMALL NUMBER, ONE OR TWO.
>> AND YOU KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER
CONTINUED TO GO THROUGH, YOU 
HEARD SHOTS FROM OTHER PARTS OF 
THE SCHOOL.
BUT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT COME INTO 
YOUR CLASSROOM AT ALL.
>> NO.
>> YOU NEVER SAW THE SHOOTER 
WALK BY YOUR CLASSROOM?
>> NO, I DO NOT HAVE WHAT HE 
LOOKED LIKE.
>> BECAUSE YOU WERE DOWN ON THE 
GROUND.
>> YES.
>> MICHAEL, THANKS VERY MUCH.
THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ALL OF 
US.
AND I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO 
YOUR FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES 
RIGHT NOW.
I HOPE WE CAN CALL YOU BACK IF 
YOU PICK UP NEW INFORMATION.
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE SAFE AND WE'RE
HOPING FOR THE BEST FOR YOUR 
CLASSMATES AND SCHOOL MATES.
I WANT TO BRING IN BRAD.
THOSE ARE STUDENTS BEING LET OUT
OF THE HIGH SCHOOL.
WE KNOW ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE 
EYEWITNESSES THAT THE SHOOTING 
UNFOLDED AROUND 2:20 P.M. THERE 
NORTHEAST OF FT. LAUDERDALE, 
FLORIDA.
ACCORDING TO MARK KATZ ON THE 
SCENE, POLICE ON THE SCENE RIGHT
NOW, ESCORTING STUDENTS OUT.
I WANT TO BRING IN BRAD GARRETT,
FBI SPECIAL AGENT.
IT DOES APPEAR, BRAD, ACCORDING 
TO WHAT MARK KATZ WAS TELLING 
US, THEY WERE PRETTY WELL TR
TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL PERHAPS 
PREVENTING ANY MORE SERIOUS 
SITUATION?
>> THIS IS A SERIOUS SITUATION.
AND YES, TRAINING DOES SAVE 
LIVES EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE 
ACTIVE DRILLS IF YOU AT LEAST 
LET THE KIDS, IN PARTICULAR, THE
FACULTY, KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO 
DO.
GOING BACK TO THE THREE WORDS, 
RUN, HIDE, FIGHT.
PARTICULARLY, THE FIRST TWO -- 
RUN AND HIDE.
DEFINITELY GET PEOPLE AWAY FROM 
THE SHOOTER.
AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR 
HIM TO GET TO YOU.
>> RIGHT.
AND IT DOES SOUND LIKE THAT WAS 
THAT FOLLOWED.
WE ARE SEEING EVACUATION 
CONTINUING.
WE WANT TO GO TO CECILIA VEGA.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BRIEFED?
>> YES, WE HEARD FROM LINDSAY 
WALTERS WHO TOLD US THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN BRIEFED
ON THIS SHOOTING IN FLORIDA.
WE'RE TOLD THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
IS ACTIVELY MONITORING THE 
SITUATION AND OF COURSE, THEY 
EXTEND THEIR THOUGHTS AND 
PRAYERS TO THOSE AFFECTED.
STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS IS THE 
SECOND ALERT THAT THIS WHITE 
HOUSE HAS HAD TO SEND OUT TODAY.
THE SECOND TIME THE PRESIDENT 
BRIEFED ON A SHOOTING, OF COURSE
EARLIER, THAT INCIDENT AT 
FT. MEADE.
THEY SENT OUT A STATEMENT ABOUT 
THAT.
WE ARE EXPECTING A BRIEFING 
WITHIN THE HOUR FROM PRESS 
SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS.
AND AS YOU KNOW, GEORGE, THIS 
INCIDENT COMES AS THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS IN TURMOIL WITH THIS 
ROB PORTER SCANDAL.
THEY'VE GOT A LOT ON THEIR PLATE
TODAY.
>> THEY HAVE A LOT GOING ON.
VICTOR KENDALL.
HEADING TOWARDS THE HIGH SCHOOL.
VICTOR, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT THE SCOMBRONS. 
>> >> WE'VE GOT THOSE IN BROWARD
COUNTY JUST ZEROING IN ON THE 
SCHOOL.
AND THEY'RE CALLING IT RIGHT NOW
A MASS CASUALTY INCIDENT.
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20 AND 50 WITH
THESE INCIDENTS.
THE NUMBERS CAN ALWAYS CHANGE 
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE NUMBERS 
TEND TO GROW HERE.
>> WHERE ARE YOU GETTING MASS --
SPECIFICALLY, WHO IS SAYING 
THAT?
>> THAT WAS FROM THE BROWARD 
COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, I 
BELIEVE.
AND I BELIEVE, 20 TO 50 VICTIMS 
RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT SURE.
AS FAR AS FATALITIES, NO 
OFFICIAL WORD ON THAT YET.
WE'RE ALL SCRAMBLING FOR 
INFORMATION RIGHT NOW.
THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONFIRMED 
RIGHT NOW BUT THEY ARE DEALING 
WITH SEVERAL PATIENTS.
20 TO 50 PATIENTS RIGHT NOW IS 
THE NUMBER THAT I'M GETTING ON 
THE GROUND.
BUT I'M STILL HEADING, I'M 
MAKING MY WAY UP THERE.
>> WE'LL LET YOU GET THERE.
AT THE SCENE, WE SEE PEOPLE 
BEING TREATED.
WE SEE SOME OF THE VICTIMS 
THERE, STRETCHERS.
ACCORDING TO MICHAEL KATZ WHO 
WAS IN THE SCHOOL WHEN THE 
SHOOTING BEGAN.
HE PERSONALLY SAW TWO VICTIMS 
INSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL.
I WANT TO GO TO OUR SENIOR 
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE 
THOMAS.
FEDERAL RESPONSE ALREADY?
>> GEORGE, WE HAVE FBI AGENTS ON
THE WAY TO THE SCENE.
THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW 
POTENTIALLY BAD THE SITUATION 
IS.
WE CAN SEE FROM THE MASSIVE 
POLICE PRESENCE OUTSIDE THAT 
SCHOOL THAT THERE'S CONCERN THAT
THE SHOOTER IS STILL AT LARGE.
AND I THINK THAT'S THE THING 
THAT HAS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED RIGHT 
NOW, THAT THIS IS NOT A 
CONTAINED EVENT.
WE EXPECT THAT THE FBI WILL WORK
CLOSELY WITH THE BROWARD 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO GET A 
HANDLE ON THE SITUATION.
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER IS 
CONTAINED.
WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE HOW MANY 
PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF 
THIS INCIDENT.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THE 
PERIMETER, AS YOU SEE THEM 
DOING, AND GET THOSE KIDS 
OUTSIDE OF THAT SCHOOL.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT WE SEE THERE, THOSE ARMORED
VEHICLES.
WE SAW S.W.A.T. TEAMS EARLIER GO
IN.
BRAD GARRETT, ACCORDING TO 
MICHAEL KATZ, THE ONE WITNESS 
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO SO 
FAR, THE SHOOTING WENT ON FOR A 
FEW MINUTES BUT THIS IS BEING 
DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION.
TRY AND TELL US WHAT THE 
S.W.A.T. TEAMS ARE DOING IF THEY
ENTER THE SCHOOL?
>> WELL, ONE OF THE KEYS, 
GEORGE, JUST LIKE THE KID YOU 
INTERVIEWED, WHO HAS INFORMATION
ABOUT THE SHOOTER AND WHERE HE 
WAS AND WHERE HE WAS MOVING.
BECAUSE WHAT I SEE ON 
TELEVISION, THEY TEND TO BE 
FOCUSED ON ONE PART OF THE HIGH 
SCHOOL WHICH IS PROBABLY WHERE 
THE SHOOTER COMMITTED THIS ACT.
SO, THE KEY IS GOING TO BE WITH 
WHAT WE HAVE, WITH CAMERAS AND 
CCTV ARE IN PLACE THAT THEY CAN 
REVIEW AS THEY MOVE FORWARD.
IT'S INTERESTING TO WATCH THE 
S.W.A.T. TEAM MOVE AROUND.
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY IN A HUGE 
HURRY.
SO, I DON'T WANT TO READ TOO 
MUCH INTO THAT, GEORGE, BECAUSE 
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE SHOOTER'S
DOWN.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE CLEARING THE 
BUILDING.
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST 
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ARE FIVE 
MINUTES OR LESS.
EVEN SANDY WAS LESS.
>> MICHAEL KATZ THOUGHT IT WENT 
ON FOUR TO SIX MINUTES.
BRAD, THANKS SO MUCH.
>> I WANT TO GO TO OUR FI AFFILE
WPRG.
THEY'RE SPEAKING THERE.
>> THE FAMILY KEEPS TEXTING HER,
AND SHE'S TEXTING BACK, THANK 
GOD.
>> ARE YOU RELIEVED?
>> I'LL BE RELIEVED WHEN SHE 
COMES OUT AND I CAN GIVE HER A 
HUG.
>> ARE YOU RELATED?
>> NO, JUST MET.
>> Reporter: AND DO YOU HAVE A 
SON OR DAUGHTER?
>> NINTH GRADE DAUGHTER.
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE 
TO CONTACT HER?
>> YES, SHE'S OKAY.
>> Reporter: SHE'S LOCKED IN THE
AUDITORIUM AS WELL?
>> YES.
WE KEEP PRAYING.
>> Reporter: DO YOU HAVE 
SOMEBODY?
>> YEAH, SHE'S TEXTING ME RIGHT 
NOW, SHE KEEPS TELLING ME STAY 
AWAY.
WE'RE SAFE MOM, YOU STAY AWAY.
I'M TELLING HER, NO, CRYSTAL, 
I'M YOUR MOTHER, I'M NOT STAYING
AWAY.
>> Reporter: HOW DID YOU GET 
WORD OF WHAT'S GOING ON OUT 
HERE?
>> I WAS ACTUALLY AT THE NAIL 
SALON, I SAW IT BREAK THROUGH ON
TV, IT SAID STONEMAN DOUGLAS 
HIGH SCHOOL.
MY HUSBAND SAID MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO SEE.
>> Reporter: WERE YOU THERE 
RICHT AWAY OR DID IT TAKE TIME?
>> SHE TEXTED ME PRETTY CLOSE TO
WHEN IT STARTED HAPPENING.
SHE SAID SHE'S SCARED.
SHE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.
SHE SAID, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO 
SCHOOL TOMORROW, MOM.
I SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
>> Reporter: DID SHE TELL YOU IF
ANYBODY WAS INJURED?
>> NO, SHE'S JUST SAYING SHE'S 
THERE.
AND I SAID LIST TON EN TO WHAT  
TEACHERS TELL YOU TO DO.
AND I SAID, CAN I CALL YOU?
SHE SAID NO, THEY'RE TELLING US 
TO BE QUIET.
>> Reporter: WE'RE JUST SOUTH OF
THE SCHOOL ON AN OVERPASS WHERE 
A NUMBER OF PARENTS ARE 
BASICALLY BEING TOLD TO GATHER 
AROUND.
TRYING TO GET WHATEVER PIECE OF 
INFORMATION THEY CAN IN TERMS OF
HOW THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER IS 
DOING.
PERIODICALLY, WHAT WE'LL SEE -- 
>> THAT'S STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH 
SCHOOL IN PARKLAND, FLORIDA.
RIGHT NOW, A SHOOT SHOOTING 
UNFOLDED AT 2:20 P.M. EASTERN 
TIME.
THIS IS BEING DESCRIBED AS A 
MASS CASUALTY EVENT RIGHT NOW.
YOU SEE POLICE OUTSIDE THE HIGH 
SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.
THE LAST 30 MINUTES OR SO, 
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED 
FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL.
IT'S BEING DESCRIBED BY POLICE 
NOW AS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION.
ALTHOUGH, I KNOW SHOTS HAVE BEEN
HEARD FOR THE LAST SEVERAL 
MINUTES.
ONE OF OUR SENIOR CORRESPONDENTS
PIERRE THOMAS.
THIS SCENE BECOMING ALL TOO 
FAMILIAR IN AMERICA?
>> IT REALLY IS, GEORGE.
WE HAVE SEEN ALL KINDS OF 
SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS, SHOPPING 
CENTERS.
AND AGAIN, THE ONES AT THE 
SCHOOL ARE PARTICULARLY HEART 
WRENCHING BECAUSE OF CHILDREN 
BEING INVOLVED.
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE DEALT WITH 
THESE SITUATIONS OVER AND OVER, 
TRAINING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
TO BE PREPARED.
HOPEFULLY, THAT SAVED SOME LIVES
TODAY.
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE FBI AND 
DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS TRYING TO GET A SENSE 
OF JUST HOW MANY CASUALTIES AND 
IF THERE ARE ANY FATALITIES.
WE STILL DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL 
WORD ON THAT, GEORGE.
>> WPLG SPEAKING WITH THE 
GRANDMOTHER OF ONE OF THE 
STUDENTS INSIDE, LET'S LISTEN.
>> I'M FROM NEW YORK AND I COME 
HERE OFTEN.
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU TALKED TO 
THE PARENTS?
ARE THEY HERE AS WELL?
>> YEAH, THE MOTHER IS HERE WITH
ME, MY DAUGHTER.
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS ARE TRYING
TO GET SOME INFORMATION.
>> WE'RE TRYING TO GET 
INFORMATION.
WE CAN'T GET AHOLD OF HER.
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU CALLED AND
NOTHING HAS COME BACK.
>> WE HEARD HER GIRLFRIEND GOT 
SHOT.
SHE'S VERY NERVOUS.
>> Reporter: SHE'S A SENIOR AT 
THE SCHOOL HERE?
>> YEAH, SHE'S A SENIOR AT THE 
SCHOOL HERE.
>> Reporter: I SEE THEM ASKING 
THE PARENTS TO MAKE THEIR WAY 
OUT TO THE PARK.
THEY WANT TO CLEAR THE AREA.
>> THAT'S WHAT MY DAUGHTER SAID,
THEY WANT TO CLEAR THE AREA.
>> Reporter: LORI, THAT'S KIND 
OF THE STORY, AFTER STORY, THAT 
WE'RE SEEING OUT HERE.
A LOT OF PARENTS HAVE VERY 
LITTLE INFORMATION ON HOW THEIR 
KIDS ARE DOING.
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY DON'T 
KNOW JUST YET WHEN THE 
STUDENTS -- 
>> MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH
SCHOOL.
THE SCENE OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION, STARTED UNFOLDING 
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
WE KNOW OF SEVERAL INJURED.
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, THE 
INFORMATION COMING IN RIGHT NOW 
IS STILL SKETCHY.
ACCORDING TO ONE EYEWITNESS, TWO
DEAD ON THE SCENE.
AGAIN THAT HAS NOT BEEN 
CONFIRMED BY OTHERS RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO BRAD 
GARRETT.
AS WE CATCH THOSE POLICE OUTSIDE
THE HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT THERE, 
BRAD, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE 
BEEN SEEING FOR THE LAST HALF 
HOUR OR SO, PERIODICALLY, A 
BURST OF STUDENTS LEAVING THE 
SCHOOL.
NOW, WE'RE ALSO SEEING SOME OF 
THE INJURED BEING TREATED 
OUTSIDE.
MASSIVE POLICE PRESENCE.
WE KNOW S.W.A.T. TEAMS ARE 
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.
>> THEY CERTAINLY ARE, GEORGE.
AND AS THEY GET CLOSER TO THE 
SHOOTER EVEN IF THEY THINK HE'S 
DECEASED OR NOT, THIS IS GOING 
TO BE SORT OF A METHODICAL MOVE.
ROOM TO ROOM TO ROOM.
THEY'RE GOING TO ENTER THE ROOM 
LIKE THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER.
CLEAR IT AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
ROOM.
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS SO BIG.
AND IT APPEARS TO COVER SEVERAL 
ACRES, I THINK YOU'VE SEEN FOR A
NUMBER OF KIDS LEAVING THE 
SCHOOL PROBABLY IN THE SECTION 
OF THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY THINK 
THE SHOOTER IS NOT.
AND SO, I SUSPECT THAT'S GOING 
TO GO ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
BUT EXPECT THIS TO GO ON FOR A 
WHILE.
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT 
TRANSPIRED IN THAT SCHOOL.
AND WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE 
SHOOTER.
>> THE ONE EYEWITNESS WE WERE 
ABLE TO SPEAK WITH, MICHAEL 
KATZ, SAID THAT THERE WERE TOO 
MANY SHOTS TO COUNT OVER A 
PERIOD OF FOUR TO SIX MINUTES 
BUT IT DID NOT SOUND LIKE A 
MACHINE GUN, LIKE AN AUTOMATIC 
WEAPON.
>> RIGHT.
AND VIRTUALLY, GEORGE, WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF OUR CONVERSATIONS 
AT LAS VEGAS, MOST OF THESE 
SHOOTERS UNLIKE THAT GENTLEMAN 
STEPHEN PADDOCK, TEND TO USE 
SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS OR IN 
ADAM LANZA'S CASE IN SANDY HOOK,
HE USED AN AK-15 TYPE WEAPON 
THAT SHOOTS ROUNDS BUT NOT 
AUTOMATIC.
EVEN SHOOTING A MACHINE GUN WITH
A MAGAZINE, YOU CAN EMPTY THAT 
MAGAZINE IN PROBABLY FOUR TO SIX
SECONDS.
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MAGAZINES 
THINK OF HOW MANY ROUNDS YOU CAN
GET OFF IN FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES.
>> WE HAVE REPORTS OF PEOPLE 
INJURED.
THAT IS ONE OF THE STUDENTS.
>> MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS.
>> Reporter: WHERE WERE YOU WHEN
THE SHOTS RANG OUT?
>> I WAS BY THE HIGHWAY OVER 
THERE.
>> Reporter: ON THAT SIDE?
>> YEAH.
>> Reporter: AND YOU KNEW 
IMMEDIATELY WHAT WAS GOING ON?
>> YEAH, NO DOUBT.
I HEARD IT AND I RAN.
>> Reporter: ARE YOU ABLE TO GET
AHOLD OF YOUR CLASSMATES YOUR 
FRIENDS? 
>> MY SISTER'S STILL IN THERE.
SHE'S TEXTING ME.
SHE SAID BE QUIET.
>> Reporter: I KNOW ONE GUY GOT 
SHOT IN THE LEG.
I HEARD MY TEACHER GOT SHOT.
MY NINTH GRADE TEACHER, THAT'S 
ALL I KNOW.
>> Reporter: ONCE AGAIN, YOU 
WERE WHERE ON CAMPUS?
>> I WAS OVER THERE.
>> Reporter: WHEN YOU WERE 
TEXTING SOME OF THESE FOLKS, 
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU?
>> THEY TOLD ME, WE'RE IN TRUCK 
RIGHT NOW, WE NEED HELP ASAP.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
>> Reporter: SENSE IS EVERYONE 
IS IN LOCKDOWN IN THE 
CLASSROOMS? 
>> YES.
>> Reporter: YOUR SISTER IS 
STILL IN THERE. 
>> YES.
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU GOTTEN 
AHOLD OF YOUR PARENTS AND WHAT 
DID THEY TELL YOU?
>> THEY TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING.
>> WE HAVE A STUDENT ON THE 
PHONE RIGHT NOW, ALEXANDRIA 
ROBINSON IS JOINING US.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
TELL US WHERE YOU ARE NOW AND 
WHAT YOU SAW AND HEARD.
>> I'M AT HOME RIGHT NOW WHAT 
HAPPENED TO ME LOOKING AT SUN 
SPOTS ON THE SUN MY TEACHER WAS 
SHOWING US.
AND HE SAID WE CAN GO BACK 
INSIDE.
AND THEN THERE WAS A FIRE ALARM.
WE ALREADY HAD A DRILL IN THE 
MORNING, NONETHELESS, I WENT AND
GOT MY BOOKS AND THEN IT 
STOPPED.
THEN I WAS CONFUSED.
ONE OUR PRINCIPALS CAME ON THE 
INTERCOM, SAID PLEASE EVACUATE 
THE BUILDING.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE.
WE WERE ALL WALKING OUT, NOT 
RUNNING.
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD 
TWO POPS, THAT WAS WHEN I KIND 
OF UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING.
ME AND MY FRIENDS -- I MET UP 
WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS WE WERE 
JUST RUNNING FOR OUR LIVES.
AT WIN POINT, WE STOPPED AND A 
SECURITY GUARD TOLD US TO KEEP 
RUNNING, GO.
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THIS WAS LIKE
A REAL SHOOTING THING.
>> ABOUT WHAT TIME WAS THAT?
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET 
OUT OF THE SCHOOL?
>> I HAD TO RUN ALL THE WAY TO 
THE WALMART.
THAT'S NEAR OUR SCHOOL.
THAT TOOK ME LIKE A TOTAL OF TEN
MINUTES TO GET THERE.
ACTUALLY GETTING OUTSIDE OF THE 
SCHOOL, IT'S A BIG SCHOOL, 
PROBABLY TOOK ME ABOUT FIVE 
MINUTES RUNNING.
>> AND YOU SAY YOU HEARD 
PERSONALLY TWO POPS? 
>> YES.
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE OR 
HOW FAR THEY WERE.
I WASN'T ABLE TO GAUGE IT.
BUT DEFINITELY WASN'T THAT FAR.
I HEARD TWO POPS.
AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED 
RUNNING.
I HEARD A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE WHAT'S
HAPPENING AND WHO'S BEEN HURT 
AND STUFF.
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
>> WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO 
GLEAN FROM YOUR FRIENDS AND 
OTHERS IN THE SCHOOL FROM TEXT 
MESSAGES, PHONE CALLS ABOUT WHAT
ELSE MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED, OTHER 
PEOPLE HURT, ANYBODY THAT YOU 
KNOW?
>> I KNOW THAT ONE OF MY GOOD 
FRIENDS IS STILL IN THE SCHOOL.
I'M TEXTING HERE KEEPING UPDATED
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON.
I HEARD THAT FIVE PEOPLE WERE 
SHOT.
AND THERE'S 20 VICTIMS.
AND I'M NOT SURE OF THE 
SPECIFICS.
I HEARD THERE IS VIDEO SURFACING
OF PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR LYING 
DEAD.
>> WHAT IS YOUR FRIEND TELLING 
YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE 
SCHOOL?
>> I HEARD THAT IN THE FRESHMEN 
BUILDING OF THE SCHOOL.
I KNOW MY FRIEND IS PRETTY FAR 
FROM THAT, THAT'S GOOD.
>> YOU MEAN, YOU HEARD THAT THE 
SHOOTER IS IN THE FRESHMEN 
BUILDING OF THE SCHOOL?
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I HEARD BUT
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.
>> TRY TO GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW
BIG THE SCHOOL IS.
YOU SAY THE FRESHMEN BUILDING, 
HOW MANY BUILDINGS ARE IN THIS 
HIGH SCHOOL?
>> WELL, THE BUILDINGS HAVE 
DIFFERENT NUMBERS.
THERE'S A TOTAL OF, I WOULD SAY,
LIKE TEN BUILDINGS.
IT'S LIKE THE SIZE OF A SMALL 
UNIVERSITY.
>> SO IT'S A VERY LARGE SCHOOL.
SEVERAL THOUSAND STUDENTS.
YOU'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE 
SHOOTER WAS IN THE FRESHMEN 
BUILDING.
DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION 
ABOUT WHETHER THE SHOOTER IS 
STILL ALIVE?
WHETHER THERE ARE OTHERS IN THE 
BUILDING WITH HIM RIGHT NOW, ANY
HOSTAGES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT OR 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
I'M ASSUMING HE HAS HOSTAGES IF 
HE'S IN THE FRESHMEN BUILDING 
PROBABLY HOLDING PEOPLE.
I HEARD THAT ONE OF MY FAVORITE 
TEACHERS -- I THINK SHE'S OKAY, 
BUT I HEARD SHE WAS HELPING A 
STUDENT, THEY SOUGHT AW HER WAL 
OUT WITH BLOOD ON HER LEG.
I KNOW THERE WAS BLOOD.
FOR A FACT.
>> YOU'RE HOME RIGHT NOW.
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THAT ONE 
FRIEND IS THE ONLY FRIEND YOU'RE
IN CONTACT WITH INSIDE THE 
SCHOOL RIGHT NOW?
>> THERE ARE ACTUALLY A FEW 
FRIENDS I KNOW FOR A FACT STILL 
IN THE SCHOOL.
BUT THE ONE I'M TEXTING, THAT'S 
THE ONLY ONE I'M TEXTING IN THE 
SCHOOL.
>> HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ANYONE 
INSIDE THAT FRESHMEN BUILDING 
WHERE THE SHOOTER IS SAID TO BE?
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.
BUT I WAS ABOUT TO TEXT ONE OF 
MY FRIENDS.
RIGHT NOW.
>> WELL, ALEXANDRIA, THANK YOU.
WHY DON'T YOU TEXT YOUR FRIEND.
WE'LL TRY AND STAY IN TOUCH WITH
YOU, IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE 
INFORMATION, WE'LL COME BACK TO 
YOU.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR 
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE 
THOMAS.
PIERRE.
>> GEORGE, WE'RE GETTING 
INFORMATION THAT THIS IS AN 
EVENT INVOLVING MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
INJURED.
TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES 
TELLING ABC NEWS THAT THE 
INFORMATION IS AT LEAST 20 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT.
AGAIN, I PREFACE MY REMARKS BY 
SAYING IT'S A VERY FLUID 
SITUATION BECOME LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS STILL TRYING TO GET A 
HANDLE ON IT.
THE EARLY INDICATION, IN TERMS 
OF ALERTS THAT WENT OUT TO LOCAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER LAW 
ENFORCE MEANT, AT LEAST INJURED.
>> WE SPOKE EARLIER TO MICHAEL 
KATZ, A STUDENT INSIDE THE 
SCHOOL SAW TWO BODIES OUTSIDE OF
HIS CLASSROOM.
A WANT TO BRING IN TOM LLAMAS 
WITH MORE.
>> I WORKED IN SOUTH FLORIDA FOR
A COUPLE YEARS.
I WANT TO BREAK DOWN WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING OVER THE AREA.
THIS IS STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH 
SCHOOL.
THAT'S A HIGH SCHOOL OF 3,000 
PEOPLE.
WHAT'S CONFUSING TO POLICE, 
THERE'S A NEARBY SCHOOL, WEST 
GLADES MIDDLE SCHOOL, ABOUT A 
FIVE-MINUTE WALK.
IT'S POSSIBLE ONE OF THE THINGS 
THEY'RE LOOKING AT IF THE 
SHOOTER GOT OUT IF HE'S ABLE TO 
MIX IN WITH STUDENTS OR CROWDS 
AT THAT NEEARBY SCHOOL.
PARKLAND DOES NOT HAVE A POLICE 
DEPARTMENT.
THEY'VE CONTACTED BROWARD.
I'M TOLD S.W.A.T. TEAM MEMBERS 
ARE THE ONES ON THE GROUNDS 
THERE BUT THE COAL SPRINGS 
POLICE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS A 
NEARBY TOWN IS ONE OF THE FIRST 
RESPONDING AGENCIES THERE.
THEY PUT OUT A TWEET RIGHT NOW 
WHICH IS CHILLING.
THEY POSTED POLICE ARE WORKING 
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SCENE AND 
ASKED IF YOU ARE IN TOUCH WITH 
YOUR STUDENT YOU ASK THAT THEY 
REMAIN CALM AND BARRICADED UNTIL
POLICE COME TO THE ROOM.
THIS IS FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY.
DO NOT CALL 911 OR EMERGENCY 
NUMBER UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
IMAGINE WHAT PARENTS ARE 
THINKING WHEN THEY GET THAT 
MESSAGE.
THAT EYEWITNESS YOU JUST SPOKE 
TO, THE STUDENT IN HIGH SCHOOL, 
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING 
ON.
>> IT'S A STORY ALL TOO FAMILIAR
RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO GO TO STEVE GOMEZ, 
ALSO A FORMER FBI AGENT JOINING 
US AS WELL.
DESCRIBING IT AS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION.
THEY BELIEVE THE SHOOTER WAS IN 
ONE OF THE TEN BUILDINGS OF THE 
FRESHMEN HIGH SCHOOL.
WALK US THROUGH THE PROCEDURES 
THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH THIS 
ACTIVE SHOOTER.
>> WELL, THE FIRST THING THEY 
WANT GO IS GET AS MANY AS THE 
STUDENTS OR FACULTY OUT OF THE 
AREA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
YOU DON'T WANT ANY MORE 
INJURIES.
THEY'RE CONTAINING THE 
SITUATION.
WE ALREADY SAW, I THINK AT LEAST
ONE S.W.A.T. TEAM GO IN THERE.
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO IMMEDIATELY
MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT SHOOTER 
OR SHOOTERS BECAUSE THERE'S A 
POSSIBILITY THAT STUDENTS OR 
FACULTY MAY BE HOSTAGE AND THEIR
LIVES MAY BE IN PERIL.
>> WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT THIS 
IS GOING TON FOR AN HOUR AND 20 
MINUTES TELL US?
>> IT INDICATES THAT THE SHOOTER
IS HOLED UP.
IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE THIS IS 
A VERY LARGE CAMPUS.
AND NOT KNOWING THE WEAPONRY 
THAT THE SHOOTER HAS, THERE'S 
ALWAYS A CONCERN THAT THE 
SHOOTER COULD BE SHOOTING 
OUTSIDE OF WINDOWS THAT HE'S 
TRYING TO SNIPER PEOPLE.
THEY'RE HAVING TO CONTAIN THE 
SITUATION.
AND A VERY LARGE LASITUATION 
BUILDING AND THEY'RE TRYING TO 
PREVENT ANY MORE LOSS OF LIVES 
OR INJURY.
THAT'S PART OF THE DIFFICULTY 
THEY HAVE WITH THE STUDENTS 
MOVING OUT.
>> WE'RE ALSO SEEING FIRST 
RESPONDERS ON THE SCENE TREAT 
SOMETHING OF THE JINJURED.
ALSO THE POLICE GOING THROUGH 
THE PILES OF BAGS OUTSIDE OF 
SCHOOL.
WHAT ASK YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?
>> WELL, THAT'S CLEARLY A 
CONCERN THAT THERE COULD BE 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, PIPE BOMBS 
AND WHAT HAVE YOU.
THE QUESTION IS, HAS THERE BEEN 
SOME TYPE OF EXPLOSION ALREADY 
WHICH IS CAUSING THAT CONCERN?
WE'VE SEEN THAT SITUATION 
HAPPENS MANY TIMES WHERE 
SOMEBODY TRIES TO BUILD A PIPE 
BOMB, SOMETIMES THEY DO, 
SOMETIMES, THEY DON'T.
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU 
BRING THAT UP, THE FIRST 
EYEWITNESS THAT WE SPOKE TO 
MICHAEL KATZ SAID THE FIRST 
COUPLE MINUTES OF SHOOTING BUT 
ALSO SOMETHING SOUNDED LIKE A 
GARBAGE TRUCK BACK FIRING OR 
CRASHING?  
>> AND THAT COULD POTENTIALLY 
BEEN THE START OF THE SITUATION 
WHERE THE SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS 
MAY HAVE DECIDED LET'S START 
WITH A PIPE BOMB BLAST.
AND AS STUDENTS ARE RUNNING 
AWAY, THEY START.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, THEY CREATE
A DIVERSION AND THEY SHOOT AT 
PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THAT'S THE TRAGEDY.
>> YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T BEEN 
GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION 
FROM INSIDE THE SCHOOL FROM 
POLICE OR OTHERS ON THE SCENE.
DOES THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T 
HEARD ABOUT HOSTAGES FROM THE 
POLICE OR ANY KIND OF 
NEGOTIATION, WHAT DOES THAT TELL
YOU?
AND IS IT ANY KIND OF REAL 
CONFIRMATION THAT IT HASN'T 
HAPPENED?
>> WELL, WHAT IT INDICATES 
POTENTIALLY IS THAT THE POLICE 
HAVE NOT YET HAD CONTACT WITH 
THE SHOOTER.
THEY MAY HAVE THE SHOOTER 
CONTAINED.
BUT THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY KNOW 
WHERE THAT SHOOTER IS.
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE 
SHOOTER, YOU KNOW, FINISHED WHAT
THE SHOOTER WAS INTENDING TO DO.
AND IS NOW WAITING FOR THE 
POLICE TO COME IN.
EITHER TAKE THEM HOSTAGE OR DIE 
BY COP OR COMMIT SUICIDE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
THINGS THAT THESE TYPE OF ACTIVE
SHOOTERS HAVE DONE IN THESE 
TYPES OF SITUATIONS.
THE POLICE ARE CONSIDERING ALL 
OF THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AS 
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR APPROACH.
>> AS YOU MENTIONED, STEVE, A 
LARGE CAMPUS.
TEN BUILDINGS.
WE'RE STILL SEEING STUDENTS 
BEING ESCORTED OUT WITH HANDS 
UP.
YOU SEE POLICE OUT THERE 
OUTSIDE.
ONE GUN TRAINED FOR A SECOND UP 
TOAST SECOND FLOOR.
MARTHA RADDATZ IN WASHINGTON.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD WITH 
THE TRAINING OF STUDENTS AND 
TEACHERS KICKED IN?
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE, EVERY SCHOOL
IN THE COUNTRY, EVERY TEACHER, 
EVERY STUDENT HAS HAD SOME KIND 
OF TRAINING ON WHAT YOU DO IF 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.
THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO.
THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO.
THEY KNOW TO TAKE COVER.
THE PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING LIKE 
THIS, IT IS NEVER OUT OF A BOOK.
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT 
WILL BE DIFFERENT.
BUT THAT TRAINING HOPEFULLY 
KICKED IN WITH THESE STUDENTS.
YOU SAW SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS 
RUNNING OUT AND SURELY INTO A 
PART OF THE BUILDING WHERE THE 
SHOOTER WAS NOT.
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THOSE 
BUILDINGS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY 
HAVE TRAINED TO DO.
>> AND WE'RE STILL SEEING LIVE 
PICTURES.
RIGHT NOW, YOU SEE MORE STUDENTS
BEING ESCORTED OUT.
WHAT IS SAY VERY LARGE CAMPUS IN
SOUTH FLORIDA.
TEN BUILDINGS, ACCORDING TO ONE 
OF THE BUILDING.
TOM LLAMAS, WE'VE SEEN A MASSIVE
RESPONSE, AND THE GOVERNOR OF 
FLORIDA RICK SCOTT NOW HEADING 
THERE?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HAVE 
MULTIPLE AGENCIES ON THE GROUND 
RESPONDING.
WE'RE TALKING 3,000 KIDS IN ONE 
OF THE SCHOOLS AND 1500 OTHER 
KIDS IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL NEXT 
DOOR.
4500 STUDENTS POTENTIALLY ALL 
COMING OUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES.
THIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE 
SITUATION.
WE HAVE BEEN TOLDING THAT 
BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
IS STAGING AN AREA FOR A 
BRIEFING.
THAT IS PRELIMINARY.
GEORGE, TO THAT POINT EARLIER, 
WE'VE NOT BEEN BRIEFED WHICH 
MEANS THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR 
THE SHOOTER AND SO MUCH UNKNOWN.
>> WE'RE GETTING A PICTURE FROM 
ONE OF THE STUDENTS INSIDE.
AJ 2200.
STILL LOCKED IN.
CHECKED THE LOCAL NEWS, 20 
VICTIMS.
LONG LIVE MARJORY STONEMAN 
DOU
DOUGLAS.
THOMAS LLAMAS, CALM AND RUNNING 
OUT BUT SOME STILL INSIDE.
>> AND THE AGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, 
WE JUST READ THAT TWEET FROM THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT WHICH TOLD 
STUDENTS STAY BARRICADED.
EVEN TELLING PARENTS NOT TO CALL
911.
NOT TO GO TO THE SCHOOL.
THEY'RE WAITING TO GET THE KIDS 
OUT.
WE SEE FIRE DEPARTMENT TREATING 
SOME CHILDREN RIGHT THERE ON THE
SCENE, THE SIDEWALK.
LOOKS LIKE -- YEAH, FIRE 
DEPARTMENT AND PARAMEDICS BOTH 
ON THE SCENE RIGHT THERE.
IT'S HARD TO READ.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PARKLAND FIRE
DEPARTMENT.
MASSIVE SCENE.
SEVERAL AGENCIES STILL 
RESPONDING AND ACTIVE ON THE 
HOUR.
>> JOINED ON THE PHONE BY THE 
CHIEF OF BROWARD.
WE SAW THIS LOCALLY FROM LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND STUDENTS HAVE 
BEEN TRAINED.
EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY 
NOW HAS EMERGENCY TRAINING FOR 
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE 
BECOME ALL TOO PREVALENT IN OUR 
COUNTRY?
>> YES, GEORGE.
THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE 
SHELTERING IN PLACE.
LET'S BE REMINDED THAT MANY 
STATES PASSED LAWS THAT ARMED 
SOME OF THEIR TEACHERS.
AND WE NEED TO BE AWARE AS WE'RE
RESPONDING TO THIS WHO MIGHT BE 
THE ACTIVE SHOOTER AND WHO MIGHT
BE A CONCEALED CARRIER.
SO THIS IS A VERY TENSE TIME TO 
TRY TO IDENTIFY AND REALLY 
LOCATE AND HOPEFULLY, PIN DOWN 
THIS ACTIVE SHOOTER SO THAT WE 
CAN MAKE THESE STUDENTS SAFE.
CHIEF, WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY 
REPORTS WITH ANY CONTACT WITH 
THE SHOOTER OF ANY KIND.
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN REPORTS OF 
ANY SHOTS FIRED IN THE LAST 
HOUR.
SINCE ABOUT 2:30 ON THE SCENE 
THERE IN FLORIDA.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
>> WELL, OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS, 
THE SHOOTERS EVENTUALLY COMMIT 
SUICIDE.
BUT YOU HAVE TO TREAT IT AS IF 
HE'S STILL ALIVE.
IF THEY DO WHATEVER THEY'RE 
DOING, HURT AS MANY PEOPLE AS 
THEY CAN, AND THEN THEY GET 
CORNERED, THEY ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY COMMIT SUICIDE.
THE OFFICERS NOT KNOWING WHAT 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE HAVE TO 
TREAT IT AS IF HE'S STILL ON THE
LOOSE, STILL ACTIVELY TRYING TO 
HURT PEOPLE.
BUT THAT ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF 
SUICIDE MIGHT BE WHAT WE'RE 
EXPERIENCING NOW.
>> SO, THERE ARE TWO IMMEDIATE 
JOBS, EVACUATE THE STUDENTS 
THERE.
FIND THE SHOOTER?
>> YES.
YOU KNOW, FIRST, OF COURSE, TEND
TO THE JIR INJURED OR WOUNDED I 
THAT'S THE CASE.
BUT AGAIN, THE SOONER YOU CAN 
NEUTRALIZE THE SUSPECT, THE 
SAFER EVERYONE WILL BE.
SO, OFFICERS WON'T BE WAITING TO
GO IN SEARCH AND SEEK OUT THIS 
SHOOTER.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WEIGHING IN 
ON TWITTER RIGHT NOW SAYING MY 
PRAYERS AND CONDOLENCES TO THE 
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS OF 
TERRIBLE FLORIDA SHOOTING.
NO CHILD, TEACHER OR ANYONE ELSE
SHOULD EVER FEEL UNSAFE IN AN 
AMERICAN SCHOOL.
PIERRE THOMAS, SO OFTEN, THEY 
DO.
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS SUCH A TENSE 
SITUATION.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO 
REMIND PEOPLE AS WELL, I SPOKE 
WITH THE FBI MANY TIMES AND 
THEY'VE DONE TRAINING WITH THESE
LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY 
EMPHASIZE IS FOR THE POLICE TO 
GET IN AND ENGAGE THE SHOOTER AS
THE FIRST PRIORITY.
BECAUSE, IF YOU CAN DISTRACT THE
SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS, YOU CAN 
SAVE LIVES AND BEGIN TO GET 
PEOPLE OUT.
WE'RE NOW, I'M EXPECTING TO HEAR
BACK FROM A SOURCE NOW TO GET AN
UPDATE ON WHETHER THE SHOOTER 
HAS BEEN FOUND OR NOT.
AGENCY OF A FEW MINUTES WE DID 
NOT HAVE REPORTING THAT HE WAS 
IN CUSTODY.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO SOME 
ADDITION ALONG REPORTING RIGHT 
NOW, GEORGE.
>> WHY DON'T YOU GO DO THAT 
RIGHT NOW.
MEANTIME, WE HAVE OTHER PICTURES
COMING IN, AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS 
THERE OF A SCENE NEARBY THE HIGH
SCHOOL.
WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT'S 
HAPPENING THERE.
WE SEE SEVERAL POLICE ON THE 
SCENE.
AGAIN, BRAD GARRETT, WHY DON'T 
YOU WATCH THIS WITH US, FORMER 
FBI SPECIAL AGENT.
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT 
OF ACTIVITY BUT THERE ARE, YOU 
KNOW, JUST DOZENS AND DOZENS OF 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ON THE
SCENE.
>> WELL, OF COURSE.
AND THE INITIAL RESPONSE, 
GEORGE, WHEN YOU SAY ACTIVE 
SCHOOL SHOOTER, YOU'RE GOING TO 
GET BASICALLY ALL HANDS ON DECK.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF 
THE DOZENS OF UNIFORMED, OR 
VEHICLES AT THE SCENE.
SO, AS THIS BREAKS DOWN, YOU'RE 
GOING TO SEE THESE OFFICERS.
AND NOBODY APPEARS TO BE MOVING 
AT -- YOU KNOW, AT BREAKNECK 
SPEED.
BECAUSE I THINK THEY ALREADY 
HAVE A PLAN.
EITHER THE SHOOTER'S DOWN.
OR HE'S IN A PLACE WHERE HE 
HOPEFULLY CANNOT HARM PEOPLE.
NOW, I REALIZE THERE'S THE 
POSSIBILITY, IS HE BARRICADED IN
A ROOM WITH OTHER KIDS? 
I SUPPOSE THAT'S POSSIBLE.
HOPEFULLY, THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
>> AND, BRAD, I'M JUST 
SPECUSPECULATE
ING HERE, BUT WE SAW IT FROM THE
AERIALS.
YOU SEE THE POLICE CARS THAT 
SEEM TO BE DOWN THE ROAD AND 
ACROSS THE HIGHWAY FROM THE 
SCHOOL.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN 
PAST SHOOTINGS IS POLICE GO TO 
THE HOME OF THE SUSPECT WHO MAY 
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO SEE WHAT
THEY CAN FIND THERE IMMEDIATELY.
>> OF COURSE.
I MEAN, THE REAL KEY IS INTEL.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 
SHOOTER, WHAT THE INTENTION WAS 
TAKING THE SCHOOL.
WHAT WEAPONS ARE IN THE HOUSE?
DOES HE KNOW HOW TO BUILD 
EXPLOSIVES?
DOES HE USE EXPLOSIVES?
IS HE PROFICIENT WITH FIREARMS? 
ALL OF THESE THINGS YOU WANT TO 
KNOW, BECAUSE IF IN FACT HE'S 
STILL ALIVE, IT INFORMS HOW YOU 
MAY APPROACH HIM.
>> AND CECILIA VEGA AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.
WE JUST READ THAT TWEET FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THIS HAS THE WHITE HOUSE 
SCRAMBLING AS WELL?
>> YES, AND CERTAIN, YOU CAN 
IMAGINE HERE IN THIS WHITE HOUSE
THAT THE TELEVISIONS ARE ON FOR 
THIS PRESIDENT.
AND THAT HE'S SEEING THESE 
SCENES THAT WE'RE ALL WATCHING 
NOW AS A NATION RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE TOLD BY THIS WHITE HOUSE 
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ACTIVELY 
MONITORING THE SITUATION.
WE KNOW FROM FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR 
RICK SCOTT.
BOTH OF THEM HAVE SPOKEN.
THE GOVERNOR HAS GIVEN PRESIDENT
TRUMP AN UPDATE.
WE'VE ALSO IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES HEARD FROM THE FIRST 
LADY WHO SAYS SHE JOINS THE 
PRESIDENT IN EXTENDING HER 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.
WE'RE HEARING FROM A SYMPHONY OF
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIONS AS 
WELL.
FROM MARCO RUBIO, A NUMBER OF 
HOUSE MEMBERS AS WELL ACTIVELY 
MONITORING THE SITUATION.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS FIRST 
YEAR IN OFFICE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT 
MASS SHOOTINGS THREE TIME, I 
SHOULD SAY, THREE TIMES HE HAS 
ADDRESSED THE NATION ABOUT MASS 
SHOOTINGS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS TIME HAD 
TO DO THIS 17 TIMES, GEORGE.
WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS A BIT
OF A PATTERN UNFOLD IN 
WASHINGTON IN THE WAKE OF THESE 
SHOOTINGS, AS WELL, WHERE WE 
HEAR IN THE DAYS FOR THE CALLS 
FOR GUN CONTROL WHERE WE HEAR 
THE DISCUSSION OVER MENTAL 
HEALTH.
ON BOTH SIDES, I THINK ONE 
UNIFYING AGREEMENT HERE, 
EVERYBODY IS WONDERING HOW 
OFTEN, HOW MORE TIMES ARE WE 
GO 
CONVERSATION AS A NATION.
REPRESENTATIVE FREDRICERICA WIL,
GEORGE, FROM FLORIDA, IT'S 
HEARTBREAKING THAT THESE VIOLENT
INCIDENTS TAKE PLACE IN SCHOOLS 
WHERE OUR CHILDREN SHOULD FEEL 
SAFE.
>> AS YOU WERE SPEAKING THE 
PRESIDENT TWEETED AGAIN, JUST 
SPOKE TO GOVERNOR SCOTT, WE'RE 
WORKING TOGETHER ON THE TERRIBLE
SCHOOL SHOOTING.
WE HEARD FROM CHRIS MURPHREE 
FROM CONNECTICUT FROM THE SCENE 
OF THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTING.
HE SAID TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE STUDENTS
RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.
IT'S 18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, AND 
WE'VE NOT HIT MARCH.
PIERRE, I DO WANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE 
POLICE MAY HAVE SOMEONE IN HAND 
CUFFS THERE.
DON'T HAVE A CLEAR, A CLEAR VIEW
OF THAT.
YOU'RE ALSO TRYING TO GET MORE 
INFORMATION FROM YOUR SOURCES? 
>> WE'RE STILL WORKING IT, 
GEORGE.
BUT TO PICK UP ON YOUR POINT, 18
SHOOTINGS SO FAR THIS YEAR, 
WE'VE SEEN SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS.
WE'VE SEEN SHOOTINGS AT MALLS.
WE'VE SEEN SHOOTINGS IN MOVIE 
THEATERS.
VIRTUALLY EVERY PLACE THAT WE 
CALL SACRED, INCLUDING CHURCHES.
WE JUST RECALL THAT MASSIVE 
SHOOTING IN THE CHURCH JUST A 
FEW MONTHS AGO.
THIS IS NOW PART OF THE NATIONAL
NORM IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE VARIOUS ISSUES, 
BE IT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, BE 
IT TERRORISM ISSUES, BE IT JUST 
GRIEVANCES TAKE OUT THEIR 
CARNAGE ON PEOPLE IN THE MOST 
VULNERABLE OF SITUATIONS.
SO-CALLED SOFT TARGETS, AS WE'VE
HEARD SO MANY TIMES.
>> IT REALLY IS THE KIND OF 
THING WHERE WE HAVE TO STOP FOR 
A SECOND, TAKE A STEP BACK, TAKE
A DEEP BREATH AND THINK ABOUT 
WHAT THAT MEANS.
18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THIS YEAR.
IT'S FEBRUARY 14th.
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.
NOW, SOME OF THESE WILL INVOLVE,
YOU KNOW, STUDENTS IN SITUATIONS
WHERE THERE'S DISAGREEMENTS AND 
GUNS WERE PULLED OUT.
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT 
THAT THOSE WE CHERISH THE MOST, 
CHILDREN, ARE NOW SEEING THESE 
KIND OF INSTANCES HAPPEN 
ROUTINELY, GEORGE.
>> AND BRAD GARRETT, I WANT TO 
BRING IN OUR FORMER SPECIAL 
AGENT BRAD GARRETT AS WELL.
WE SEE THE POLICE AND IT DOES 
APPEAR THAT THEY MAY HAVE 
SOMEONE IN HANDCUFFS RIGHT 
THERE.
BUT WE'RE STILL BEING TOLD IT'S 
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION?
>> RIGHT.
UNTIL, GEORGE, THEY SLIABSOLUTE 
KNOW IT'S JUST ONE SHOOTER.
THEY MAY HAVE SOMEONE IN 
CUSTODY.
ALL OF THE INTEL, THEY TELL YOU,
IT'S ONE STUDENT.
BUT UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW 
THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO TREAT IT 
AS UNRESOLVED.
>> UNRESOLVED.
AS YOU SAID, THEY'RE TRITE NOW 
GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH EVERY 
BUILDING, EVERY ROOM, IN EVERY 
BUILDING EVER THAT SCHOOL.
STEP-BY-STEP, PIECE BY PIECE.
UNTIL THEY'RE SURE THAT 
EVERYBODY IS OUT?
>> EXACTLY.
AND IN PARTICULAR, THE BUILDING 
WHERE THE SHOOTER IS BECAUSE MY 
SENSE IS, AS YOU AND I TALKED I 
FEW MINUTES AGO THAT THE 
SHOOTING MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN 
ONE BUILDING.
>> RIGHT.
AND WE DID HEAR FROM ONE OF THE 
STUDENTS ON THE SCENE, 
ALEXANDRIA ROBINSON, THAT SHE 
DID BELIEVE FROM AREAS THAT SHE 
WAS HEARING FROM THE SCHOOL THAT
THE SHOOTER HAD BEEN IN THE 
FRESHMEN AREA, ISOLATED IN ONE 
OF THE BUILDINGS?
>> AND THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE, 
BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAD A 
LOT OF SHOTS AND THEN WE DIDN'T 
HAVE ANYTHING.
WHICH SUGGESTS, YOU KNOW, GOING 
BACK TO VIRGINIA TECH, SHOWED 
BASICALLY THEY WENT ONIN AGAIN.
I WANT TO PUT THAT UP ON THE 
SCREEN.
WE ALREADY SHOWED THAT.
THAT WAS -- JUST SPOKE TO 
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT AND I'M 
BEING TOLD ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
IN RIGHT NOW AS WELL.
JUST SPOKE TO GOVERNOR RICK 
SCOTT.
WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FOR THIS TERRIBLE 
FLORIDA SCHOOL SHOOTING.
THAT IS WHAT WE HEAR NOW FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IT'S COMING UP ON 4:00 P.M. 
EASTERN TIME RIGHT NOW HERE IN 
NEW YORK CITY AS WE ARE WATCHING
THOSE LIVE PICTURES THERE FROM 
SOUTH FLORIDA FROM THE STONEMAN 
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN PARKLAND,
FLORIDA WHERE AT AROUND 2:20 
P.M. THIS AFTERNOON A SCHOOL 
SHOOTING UNFOLDED, STILL BEING 
DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE SHOOTING 
SITUATION.
ACCORDING TO POLICE ON THE 
SCENE, IT IS A MASS CASUALTY 
EVENT, REPORTS OF UP TO 20 
PEOPLE INJURED.
POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED AT LEAST 
ONE DEAD ACCORDING TO ONE 
STUDENT WE SPOKE TO INSIDE THE 
SCHOOL.
THAT STUDENT ALSO SAW TWO BODIES
OUTSIDE HIS CLASSROOM.
WE'VE SEEN POLICE FOR THE LAST 
HOUR OR SO TWEETING SOME OF THE 
INJURED.
THERE YOU SEE ONE BEING WHEELED 
AWAY ON A STRETCHER, EVACUATING 
FROM THE SCHOOL UP UNTIL MOMENTS
AGO, PARENTS WITHIN TEXT CONTACT
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.
THIS HIGH SCHOOL HAS TEN 
BUILDINGS, SEVERAL THOUSAND 
STUDENTS, ACCORDING TO MICHAEL 
KATZ, ONE OF THE STUDENTS WE 
SPOKE WITH, THE SHOOTING WENT ON
FOR ABOUT FOUR TO SIX MINUTES, 
TOO MANY SHOTS TO COUNT.
HE SAID IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS OF 
THE SCHOOL -- THERE YOU SEE THE 
STUDENTS RUNNING OUT OF THE 
SCHOOL.
THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING OUT IN 
PERIODIC BURSTS.
THIS IS STILL BEING DESCRIBED AS
AN ACTIVE SHOOTING SITUATION.
WE'VE SEEN PICTURES OF ONE 
PERSON BEING TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.
WE DON'T KNOW YET WHETHER THAT 
WAS THE SHOOTER.
THE POLICE ARE STILL TREATING 
THIS AS AN ACTIVE SITUATION.
SO MUCH CONCERN THERE IN SOUTH 
FLORIDA RIGHT NOW.
TOM LLAMAS, YOU REPORTED FROM 
THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND YOU'VE 
SEEN A MASSIVE RESPONSE OVER 
THIS LAST HOUR. 
>> Reporter: YEAH, I WAS TALKING
TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE WHO 
TOLD ME THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT WHICH IS ONE OF THE 
LEADS IN THIS SITUATION HAS 
TRAINED FOR THESE TYPES OF 
SITUATIONS WITH BOTH THE MIAMI 
POLICE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER 
AGENCIES THROUGHOUT SOUTH 
FLORIDA.
THIS IS A PICTURE THAT WE SAW 
EARLIER.
THIS SEEMS TO BE A YOUNG PERSON 
IN HANDCUFFS.
IT'S A LITTLE FAR FOR US TO SEE 
THE EXACT AGE.
ONE OF THE THEORIES THEY WERE 
WORKING AT THE TIME AND IT 
STANDS TO REASON WAS THAT THE 
SHOOTER POSSIBLY WAS A YOUNG 
PERSON.
WE'RE NOT SURE IF IT WAS A 
STUDENT OR SOMEONE WHO WENT TO 
ANOTHER SCHOOL, BUT THAT WAS ONE
OF THE THINGS THEY WERE 
FOLLOWING IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE 
THEY WEREN'T SURE WHO THE 
SHOOTER WAS.
AGAIN, PART OF THE MIXUP AND 
PART OF THE CONFUSION HERE 
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME 
SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN WORD FROM ANY
POLICE AGENCY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING
ON IS THAT THERE WERE SO MANY 
STUDENTS AT BOTH OF THESE 
SCHOOLS.
STONEMAN DOUGLAS, 3,000 KIDS AND
THE NEARBY WEST GLADES MIDDLE 
PARK, 1500.
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLICE 
DEPARTMENT BUT IT'S A COUNTY 
POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 
NEIGHBORING CORAL SPRINGS HAS A 
LARGER POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT 
RAN OVER THERE.
YOU CAN SEE A STUDENT RIGHT 
THERE JUST OVERCOME WITH BRIEF 
HAVING TO LIVE THROUGH THIS, 
GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL ONE DAY IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AND 
DEALING WITH POSSIBLY UP TO 20 
STUDENTS AND/OR FACULTY INJURED 
IN THE SHOOTING. 
>> WE SAW AN INSTANCE RESPONSE 
FROM POLICE THROUGHOUT THE AREA.
WE ALSO LEARNED FROM SOME OF THE
STUDENTS INSIDE THAT THE 
STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO REACT 
QUICKLY, STUDENTS AND TEACHERS 
BOTH ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY.
SO MANY SCHOOLS HAVE NOW TRAINED
FOR THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.
EVERYBODY TAUGHT TO GET DOWN, 
GET OUT IF YOU CAN.
GET DOWN IF YOU MUST, BARRICADE 
YOURSELF INSIDE.
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE STUDENTS
THAT WE SPOKE WITH EARLIER, IT 
SOUNDED LIKE ONE SHOOTER BUT 
COULD NOT BE SURE OF THAT AND WE
HAVE NOT HEARD ANY REPORTS OF 
MORE THAN THAT RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE JUST BEEN JOINED AT THE 
DESK BY RAY KELLY, FORMER CHIEF 
OF THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE.
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE 
TRAINING.
THIS IS DRILLED THROUGH EVERY 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE REALITY 
NOW THAT POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE
TO PRACTICE THIS AND THEY DO, 
INDEED, PRACTICE EXTENSIVELY FOR
IT.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE APPROPRIATE
RESPONSE, AS WAS SAID BEFORE, 
MULTIPLE POLICE AGENCIES 
INVOLVED.
THEY NOW PRACTICE THAT 
COORDINATION.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE
ALL TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE 
ALL ON THE SAME RADIO FREQUENCY,
THAT SORT OF THING. 
>> RAY, OUR AFFILIATE, WPLG IN 
SOUTH FLORIDA IS NOW REPORTING 
THAT THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.
WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT 
OURSELVES BUT THAT IS BEING 
REPORTED IN SOUTH FLORIDA BY 
WPLG.
AND RAY, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY 
WE'RE NOT SEEING A LOT OF HECTIC
ACTIVITY. 
>> RIGHT.
THINGS LOOK FAIRLY CALM.
OBVIOUSLY IF HE WERE NOT IN 
CUSTODY THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF 
CONCERN ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO 
SHOOT OUT A WINDOW AND SHOOT 
FROM A GREAT DISTANCE.
IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE UNDER 
CONTROL AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S 
GOOD NEWS.
AGAIN, I THINK THE TRAINING AND 
THE PRACTICE THAT POLICE 
DEPARTMENTS DO PAID OFF IN THIS 
SITUATION.
THIS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS THE 
12th SCHOOL SHOOTING THAT WE'VE 
HAD SO FAR THIS YEAR.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> STEVE GOMEZ, FORMER FBI 
SPECIAL AGENT ALSO JOINING US 
NOW.
AS WE SAID, WPLG, OUR AFFILIATE 
IN SOUTH FLORIDA, IS REPORTING 
THAT THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.
WALK US THROUGH THE NEXT STEPS 
THAT FBI AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ON 
THE SCENE WOULD TAKE. 
>> IF THAT IS ONE OF THE 
SUSPECTS AND THEY'RE CLEARLY 
DOING A FAST INVESTIGATION ON 
THAT INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THEY'RE 
GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT DOES 
HE HAVE ASSOCIATES AND IS THAT 
THE ONLY SHOOTER THAT WAS 
INVOLVED.
INTERVIEWING ALL OF THE STUDENTS
AND FACULTY WHO MAY HAVE HEARD 
AND SEEN WHAT OCCURRED, THEY'RE 
GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAS 
IT ONE SHOOTER, MORE THAN ONE.
AND THEN THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
IF THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE 
AND THAT COULD EXPAND THE 
INVESTIGATION.
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE DONE AS 
FAST AS POSSIBLE IN THE EVENT 
THERE'S STILL A SUSPECT OUT 
THERE. 
>> BRAD GARRETT, AGAIN, IF THIS 
REPORT FROM WPLG IS TRUE THAT 
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY, 
RELATIVELY UNUSUAL ENDING TO A 
SHOOTING INCIDENT LIKE THIS. 
>> IT IS, GEORGE, BECAUSE 
TYPICALLY THEY SHOOT THEMSELVES 
OR THEY MAKE THE COPS SHOOT 
THEM.
SO IS THIS A SITUATION WHERE THE
POLICE GOT TO HIM BEFORE HE 
COULD DO ONE OR THE OTHER?
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
IT REALLY GOES PARTLY TO WHAT 
HIS MOTIVATION WAS IN COMMITTING
THIS SHOOTING. 
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO 
ASK YOU ABOUT.
THE QUESTION IS WAS IT SOMETHING
TARGETED AGAINST A SPECIFIC 
STUDENT OR WAS IT JUST SORT OF 
AN OUTBURST OF ANGER, RAGE. 
>> IT GOES BOTH WAYS.
TYPICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A SMALL 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHOT, IT'S 
USUALLY PERSONAL.
IT'S USUALLY DIRECTED AT A 
TEACHER, AT PARTICULAR STUDENTS,
ET CETERA.
WHEN YOU HAVE MORE MASS 
CASUALTIES WHERE SOMEBODY JUST 
WALKED INTO A ROOM AND STARTS 
GUNNING PEOPLE DOWN, WHICH 
SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, 
THIS IS SORT OF MORE GLOBAL RAGE
TOWARD THE SCHOOL. 
>> BRAD, THE PROFILE IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE SEE TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN, YOUNG MEN GENERALLY 
ISOLATED, HARBORING SOME KIND OF
SOMETIMES MENTAL ILLNESS BUT A 
LOT OF RAGE AND THEY JUST BURST.
>> WELL, IT'S A BUILDUP.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING TO 
DECIDE TOMORROW TO DO A SCHOOL 
SHOOTING.
I'M GOING TO DECIDE FOR SEVERAL 
MONTHS I'M GOING TO DO A SCHOOL 
SHOOTING.
AS IT GOES THROUGH, HE FEELS 
ANGER, RAGE, POWERLESS.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO IF ALL THOSE 
THINGS ARE GOING ON?
YOU SEEK REVENGE AND YOU GAIN 
POWER.
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER?
KILLING PEOPLE. 
>> BRAD, WHY BOYS, NOT GIRLS?
>> BECAUSE BOYS TEND TO BE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE.
IT'S JUST HER EDUCATTY, HISTORY.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT WOMEN ARE 
BECOMING MORE AGGRESSIVE AS FAR 
AS OTHER SHOOTINGS.
HOMICIDE RATES A LITTLE BIT ARE 
UP IN REFERENCE TO WOMEN.
WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN VIOLENT 
CRIMES HISTORICALLY THAT WERE 
EXCLUSIVELY MEN, THEY'RE NOW 
OPERATING.
TO YOUR QUESTION, I REALLY THINK
IT'S JUST HOW MEN DEMONSTRATE 
AND GET -- THIS IS HOW THEY DEAL
WITH THEIR ANGER AND RAGE VERSUS
A GIRL MAY SEND SOME AWFUL TEXTS
TO PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM FEEL 
BAD. 
>> PIERRE THOMAS, WE'VE SEEN 
TRAINING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND 
TRAINING INSIDE SCHOOLS, 
TRAINING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS
GO UP EVERY SINGLE MONTH.
>> WE HAVE, GEORGE.
ONE OF THE THINGS, IF THEY HAVE 
THE SUSPECT IN CUSTODY, THEY 
WILL DO AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND 
CHECK IMMEDIATELY.
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WOULD 
WANT TO FIGURE OUT IS DOES THIS 
PERSON HAVE ANY TIES TO 
TERRORISM.
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH 
MULTIPLE SOURCES.
NO ONE IS POINTING AT THAT AT 
ALL.
THEY'RE WORKING ON THE 
ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS SOMEONE 
AFFILIATED WITH THE SCHOOL, 
SOMEONE YOUNG IS ONE THEORY I'M 
BEING TOLD ABOUT, GEORGE.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE 
SEEING OVER AND OVER IN THESE 
CASES AS BRAD AS TALKED ABOUT IS
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE, TYPICALLY 
MALE, DISGRUNTLED WITH ACCESS TO
WEAPONS.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, 
GEORGE, AND THE FACT THAT THERE 
ARE ALREADY 300 MILLION GUNS 
SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY.
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S A 
VEXING ISSUE, A CHRONIC PROBLEM 
OF VIOLENCE. 
>> WE WANT TO GO BACK TO OUR 
AFFILIATE ON THE SCENE TALKING 
TO SOME OF THE PARENTS OF THE 
STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL. 
>> SHE'S NOT ON THE BUS YET.
SHE SENT ME A PICTURE AND SHE'S 
OKAY. 
>> DID YOU GET WIND OF THIS 
BEFORE YOU HEARD FROM HER?
>> I WAS ACTUALLY ON A CALL WITH
WORK AND MY PHONE WAS BLOWING UP
FROM MY WIFE.
I GOT OFF, CALLED HER BACK AND I
SAW THE TEXT MESSAGES SO I 
PARKED AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
MY WIFE IS AT THE ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL.
THEY'RE ON LOCKDOWN, CODE RED.
SHE WAS IN A TEACHER CONFERENCE 
AND THEY'RE STUCK IN THERE. 
>> DID SHE HEAR ANYTHING, SEE 
ANYTHING?
DID SHE JUST GET SHOVED IN A 
CLASSROOM?
>> SHE SAID SOME OF HER FRIENDS 
SAW SOMETHING BUT I'M NOT GOING 
TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. 
>> AS A PARENT, HOW MUCH OF A 
RELIEF WAS IT?
>> IT WAS A LITTLE EMOTIONAL IN 
THE BEGINNING.
IT WAS A GOOD SET OF EMOTIONS 
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD BECAUSE 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AS
YOU'RE WALKING UP HERE.
I WAS COMFORTING A MOTHER OVER 
HERE WHO HAS FOUR SONS HERE AND 
SHE HEARD FROM THREE OF THEM AND
SHE HADN'T HEARD FROM THE FOURTH
ONE.
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S OKAY. 
>> YOUR DAUGHTER IS TELLING YOU 
THEY'RE TAKING HER WHERE?
>> THE MAYORRRIOTT.
I WAS GOING TO HEAD OVER THAT 
WAY BUT SHE TOLD ME TO MEET HER 
AT THE MARRIOTT. 
>> HEARING FROM A RELIEVED 
PARENT RIGHT THERE.
SO MANY PARENTS SO DESPERATE TO 
BE IN TOUCH WITH THEIR STUDENTS 
WHO WERE INSIDE THAT SCHOOL TO 
KNOW THEY WERE SAFE.
THEY USE THEIR PHONES, THEY 
TEXT.
MARTHA RADDATZ, YOU'RE SAYING 
THE STUDENTS SHOULD NOT TWEET?
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD 
IDEA AT ALL TO TWEET, ESPECIALLY
IF THEY STILL HAD AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER IN THAT SCHOOL OR THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
AND CONSIDERING THEY WERE STILL 
ON LOCKDOWN WHEN THEY WERE 
TWEETING, IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
ANYBODY CAN READ THOSE TWEETS.
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE BEEN 
READING THE TWEETS.
>> MARTHA, WE'VE SEEN THAT IN 
THE PAST WITH THE ORLANDO 
SHOOTING NOW MORE THAN A YEAR 
AND A HALF AGO.
WE KNOW THE SHOOTER WAS 
FOLLOWING THE COVERAGE.
>> EXACTLY, FOLLOWING THE 
COVERAGE, LISTENING FOR THE 
SOUNDS FROM THE CLASSROOMS.
IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO 
DO.
I KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA ALL THE TIME.
WE'RE ALL ON SOCIAL MEDIA ALL 
THE TIME BUT YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE 
ANYBODY ANY INFORMATION.
CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE IN A PLACE 
WHERE YOU FEEL SAFE AND YOU WANT
TO TEXT YOUR PARENTS AND TELL 
THEM THAT AND THEY CAN PASS THAT
ON TO THE POLICE FORCE BUT 
PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT 
ON SOCIAL MEDIA UNTIL THIS IS 
OVER AND UNTIL WE KNOW AND WE'RE
WATCHING SCENES OF THE STUDENTS 
COMING OUT.
LOOK AT THOSE STUDENTS, GEORGE.
THEY ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO.
THEY EITHER PUT UP THEIR HANDS 
IN THE AIR, THEY TOUCH ONE 
ANOTHER.
THEY FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT.
THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD SAY 
EVERY ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS HAS 
SEEN BEFORE IN THEIR LIFETIME 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TRAINED, YOU 
HAVE TO PUT ALL THOSE LESSONS TO
BEAR. 
>> THERE HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF A
DRILL EARLIER IN THE DAY.
TOM LLAMAS, YOU'VE BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH SOURCES DOWN IN FLORIDA?
>> YEAH.
PROMISING NEWS AND VERY SAD 
NEWS.
FIRST THE PROMISING NEWS.
WPLG, OUR AFFILIATE IN MIAMI, IS
REPORTING THAT THE GUNMAN HAS 
BEEN ARRESTED.
THE AERIAL SHOT THAT WE HAD OF 
THE PERSON IN THE BURGUNDY SHOT 
WAS INDEED THE GUNMAN.
THIS IS PRELIMINARY IN THE 
INVESTIGATION BUT THIS IS WHAT 
OUR LOCAL AFFILIATE IS BEING 
TOLD.
THAT BEING SAID, SEVERAL 
STUDENTS FROM THE SCHOOL ARE NOW
TWEETING THAT THEY'RE BEING LED 
OUT OF THE SCHOOL, THAT THEY ARE
OKAY.
THAT BEING SAID, SENATOR BILL 
NELSON HAS REPORTEDLY SAID THERE
ARE MANY DEATHS IN THIS CASE, 
MANY FATALITIES.
>> THAT'S COMING FROM FLORIDA 
SENATOR BILL NELSON RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER POLICE 
THAT ONE PERSON CONFIRMED DEAD 
FROM AN EYE WITNESS ON THE 
SCENE.
AT LEAST TWO OTHERS DEDAD AND W 
KNOW UP TO 20 INJURED. 
>> THERE ARE LOCAL MEDIA REPORTS
THAT WE ARE WORKING TO CONFIRM 
THAT THAT PERSON YOU SAW IN 
CUSTODY THERE WHO LOOKS TO BE A 
YOUNG PERSON WAS A STUDENT 
POSSIBLY AT ONE OF THE TWO 
SCHOOLS THAT ARE NEXT TO EACH 
OTHER.
IF THAT WERE TO BE THE CASE, 
THAT WOULD STAND TO REASON WHY 
IT WOULD BE SO DIFFICULT FOR 
POLICE TO FIND THIS KID SO 
QUICKLY.
LIKE WE SAID, POSSIBLY 4500 
STUDENTS. 
>> THE BROWARD SHERIFF IS 
CONFIRMING THAT THE SHOOTER IS 
IN CUSTODY.
WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE SHOOTER IN
THE BURGUNDY SHIRT, SO THIS IS 
NO LONGER AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION IN SOUTH FLORIDA, BUT 
TOM LLAMAS, IT IS A MASS 
CASUALTY EVENT.
IT IS A SERIOUS ONE.
>> YEAH, FROM THE SOURCES THAT 
WE'VE HEARD AND WE'VE CONFIRMED 
THIS WITH THREE DIFFERENT 
SOURCES, THERE ARE AT LEAST 20 
INJURIES, AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE 
HURT.
FROM SENATOR BILL NELSON WE KNOW
THERE ARE, QUOTE, MANY DEATHS, 
MANY FATALITIES.
HE WAS BRIEFED BY THE 
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE BROWARD 
COUNTY SCHOOLS.
THAT'S A HORRIBLE PIECE OF NEWS 
RIGHT THERE, ESPECIALLY FOR SO 
MANY PARENTS THAT ARE HOME AND 
WERE TOLD DON'T CALL 911 BECAUSE
THE LINES WERE SO JAMMED BECAUSE
SO MANY PARENTS WERE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THEIR KIDS LIKE ANY PARENT
WOULD BE.
THEY WERE TOLD TO STAY THERE AND
WAIT FOR THEIR CHILD TO LEAVE 
THE SCHOOL.
YOU'RE A PARENT, I'M A PARENT.
THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. 
>> RAY KELLY, FORMER NEW YORK 
CITY POLICE CHIEF, THE SHOOTER 
NOW IN CUSTODY.
WE SEE THAT PICTURE RIGHT THERE 
NOW.
THE POLICE HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE
OUT WHY.
>> YEAH.
I WOULD BET THERE'S AN ELEMENT 
OF BULLYING INVOLVED HERE.
WE'VE SEEN IT IN SO MANY CASES.
SOM
THEY THINK ABOUT IT, PLAN IT FOR
MONTHS AND THEY ACT OUT.
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT I'M 
PRETTY SURE THERE'S AN ELEMENT 
OF THAT HERE.
>> RIGHT.
BRAD GARRETT, WE'VE SEEN THIS 
ALSO FROM SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THAT 
HAVE BEEN THWARTED, AN ELEMENT 
OF PLANNING, AS YOU SAY, 
BUILDING UP RESENTMENT FOR 
WEEKS, MAYBE MONTHS, PUTTING THE
PLAN TOGETHER AND ONE DAY 
SOMETHING SNAPS.
SOMETHING SNAPS, BUT HERE'S WHAT
HAPPENED, GEORGE.
HE HAS TOLD KIDS MAYBE NOT THAT 
HE WAS GOING TO COMMIT A MASS 
SHOOTING AT SCHOOL, BUT HIS 
ANGER, RAGE, DARKNESS, MAYBE 
FOCUS ON PARTICULAR STUDENTS OR 
GROUPS WITHIN THE SCHOOL ARE 
GOING TO BE OUT THERE.
THESE ARE TEENAGERS.
THEY TALK THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, 
TEXT EACH OTHER.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE.
THAT'S ALL GOING TO BREAK DOWN 
AT SOME POINT AS TO WHAT EXACTLY
DID THIS KID SAY TO OTHERS 
BEFORE THE SHOOTING OCCURRED.
AS YOU AND I TALKED A FEW 
MINUTES AGO, WHAT'S HIS ACCESS 
TO WEAPONS?
HOW DID HE GET THE WEAPON OR 
WEAPONS THAT HE HAD TODAY?
IT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION IN 
EVERY ONE OF THESE SHOOTERS AND 
IT'S USUALLY THE ANSWER, THEY'RE
READILY AVAILABLE AT HOME. 
>> AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN THERE 
HAVE BEEN SO MANY LOOPHOLES THAT
SO MANY PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T 
HAVE GUNS ARE ABLE TO BUY THEM.
IT DOES APPEAR, NOW THAT IT'S NO
LONGER AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION, THAT THE SHOOTER DID 
ACT ALONE.
BEFORE WE GO BACK TO YOU, BRAD, 
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE 
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LOCAL 
SCHOOL DISTRICT.
LET'S LISTEN IN TO WPLG. 
>> SUPERINTENDENT, I KNOW THIS 
HAS TO BE JUST A HORRIBLE DAY, A
NIGHTMARE FOR EVERYBODY.
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW AT THIS 
POINT. 
>> FIRST, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN PUT OUR PRAYERS OUT 
FOR THE FAMILIES, THE STUDENTS 
IN THE SCHOOL AND THIS 
COMMUNITY.
IT'S A HEARTBREAKING TRAGEDY.
WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT IS 
THAT EVERY SINGLE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ENTITY IN BROWARD 
COUNTY IS ON THE SCENE INCLUDING
THE FBI.
THERE ARE FATALITIES INVOLVED.
WE CAN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER AT 
THIS POINT.
I AM IN COMMUNICATION WITH 
SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL.
I'M GOING TO MEET WITH HIM NOW.
I'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH 
THE GOVERNOR.
EVERYONE IS PROVIDING THE FULL 
SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN.
THERE ARE CNOT CONFIRMED REPORT 
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE SHOOTER 
HAS BEEN APPREHENDED AND WE'RE 
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE 
DETAILS AT THIS POINT. 
>> THE SCENARIO WE'RE HEARING IS
THIS FORMER STUDENT ENTERED THE 
FRESHMAN BUILDING.
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF 
WHERE THE STUDENT ENTERED BUT WE
DO KNOW THAT IT OCCURRED DURING 
DISMISSAL TIME.
AND YES, IT POTENTIALLY IS SOME 
FORMER STUDENT.
I DON'T HAVE A NAME YET.
I CAN'T RELEASE ANY INFORMATION 
TO YOU.
THAT INDIVIDUAL WE BELIEVE IS IN
CUSTODY. 
>> WE HEAR A HIGH NUMBER OF 
CASUALTIES.
DO YOU KNOW JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE
MAY HAVE DIED?
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER AT
THIS POINT BUT THERE ARE 
FATALITIES INVOLVED HERE. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US AT LEAST HOW 
MANY TRANSPORTS, DO YOU KNOW, 
MAYBE A DOZEN?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER 
THAT'S BEEN TRANSPORTED AT THIS 
POINT.
AGAIN, THERE ARE NUMEROUS 
FATALITIES.
IT'S A HORRIFIC SITUATION.
IT'S A HORRIBLE DAY FOR US. 
>> WE GOT REPORTS OF MULTIPLE 
SHOO
SHOOTINGS.
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?
>> AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NO 
EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S BEEN MORE 
THAN ONE SHOOTER.
THE INDIVIDUAL, AGAIN, WE 
BELIEVE HAS BEEN APPREHENDED.
I WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE SHERIFF 
TO PROVIDE YOU ADDITIONAL 
DETAILS AROUND THAT.
>> WE HEARD THAT A TEACHER HAD 
BEEN SHOT.
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?
>> I BELIEVE THERE'S AN 
ADMINISTRATOR OR TEACHER THAT'S 
INVOLVED.
THERE MAY BE MORE.
I CAN'T CONFIRM IF THAT'S BEEN 
ONE OF THE FATALITIES AT THE 
MOMENT. 
>> THIS IS A DAY I'M SURE EVERY 
SUPERINTENDENT FEARS, AND TO 
HAPPEN HERE IN BROWARD. 
>> IT'S A DAY THAT YOU PRAY 
EVERY DAY I GET UP THAT WE WILL 
NEVER HAVE TO SEE.
IT IS IN FRONT OF US AND I ASK 
THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR PRAYERS,
YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE CHILDREN 
AND THEIR FAMILIES.
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER WE 
CAN TO COME TOGETHER AS A 
COMMUNITY TO PULL THROUGH THIS, 
AND WE WILL.
AGAIN, WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE
POSSIBLY CAN.
STUDENTS ARE BEING EVACUATED AND
RELEASED AT THE MOMENT AND WE'RE
WORKING THROUGH THAT PROCESS 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY 
INDICATION, ANY WARNING, ANY 
HINT THAT THIS STUDENT COULD 
HAVE BEEN PLANNING THIS?
>> WE RECEIVED NO WARNING, NO 
INDICATION, BUT AGAIN, THERE'S 
GOING TO BE A THOROUGH 
INVEST
INVESTIGATION.
TYPICALLY YOU SEE IN THESE 
SITUATIONS THAT THERE COULD HAVE
BEEN SIGNS OUT THERE.
I WOULD BE SPECULATING AT THIS 
POINT IF THERE WERE.
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WARNINGS.
THERE WEREN'T ANY PHONE CALLS OR
THREATS THAT WE KNOW OF THAT 
WERE MADE. 
>> SUPERINTENDENT, THERE'S SO 
MANY PARENTS THAT ARE AFRAID TO 
TAKE THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL.
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM OUT 
THERE?
>> WE CANNOT LIVE IN A WORLD 
THAT'S BUILT ON FEAR.
WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE 
GREATEST SAFETY MEASURES WE CAN 
FOR OUR KIDS.
WHAT I'LL TELL YOU IS THAT 
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- 
>> SUPERINTENDENT ROBERT RUNSY 
RIGHT THERE OF THAT SCHOOL 
DISTRICT DOWN IN SOUTH FLORIDA, 
PARKLAND, FLORIDA, THE MARJORY 
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL, 
THE SCENE OF A MASS CASUALTY 
SHOOTING.
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY, WE 
ARE TOLD.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN.
I'M JOINED FROM WASHINGTON BY 
CONGRESSMAN TED DEUTSCH, 
CONGRESSMAN FROM PARKLAND.
PARKLAND IS INSIDE YOUR 
DISTRICT.
WE'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS 
RIGHT NOW, A MASS CASUALTY 
EVENT.
FIRST OF ALL, OUR CONDOLENCES TO
YOU AND ALL THE VICTIMS IN YOUR 
DISTRICT.
WE'VE HEARD THE SHOOTER IS IN 
CUSTODY.
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US?
>> THIS IS A REALLY TRAGIC DAY, 
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE OCCURRENCE.
I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THE SHOOTER
IS IN CUSTODY.
IF TRUE, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOOD 
NEWS.
NOW FROM THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE 
HAD WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT AND 
THE MAYOR AND SHERIFF ISRAEL, WE
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF 
THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL WHO CAN 
GET OUT SAFELY ARE TENDED TO 
QUICKLY AND THAT THE COMMUNITY 
COME TOGETHER.
WE DON'T HAVE REPORTS ON THE 
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES HERE BUT 
IT'S A GRIM DAY.
THIS IS A FANTASTIC SCHOOL.
THE KIDS ARE GREAT.
I WAS THERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
THIS IS THE WORST TRAGEDY AND WE
HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A 
COMMUNITY WHICH I KNOW WE WILL.
THAT'S THE KIND OF COMMUNITY 
THIS IS BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT THAT WAS INDEED THE SHOOTER
AND WE'VE GOT TO TEND TO THOSE 
WHO NEED CARE.
FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE LOST,
WE HAVE TO BE THERE FOR THE 
FAMILIES WHO ARE GRIEVING. 
>> WE HEAR THAT SO OFTEN FROM 
THOSE ON THE SCENE IN THE HOURS 
AND DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING.
THE COMMUNITY HAS TO COME 
TOGETHER.
THE COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER, 
THEY GRIEVE, AND THEN WE HEAR IT
AGAIN IN ANOTHER SCHOOL IN 
ANOTHER CITY.
>> RIGHT.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I WAS IN A
HEARING WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND 
STARTED GETTING TEXTS FROM A 
STAFFER OF MINE WHOSE DAUGHTER 
WAS IN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL ON 
LOC
LOCKDOWN.
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE 
FOOTAGE UNTIL I WAS STANDING 
HERE WAITING TO COME ON WITH 
YOU.
WHAT IS SO TERRIBLE IS THE FACT 
THAT WHEN YOU WATCH THE VIDEO OF
KIDS RUNNING OUT OF SCHOOL WITH 
THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR AND YOU 
SEE THE INTERVIEWS AND YOU SEE 
LAW ENFORCEMENT GOING IN, WHAT'S
SO TERRIBLE IS THAT IT'S SO 
COMMON.
THAT'S THE TRULY AWFUL PART OF 
THIS.
YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DO HAVE TO COME
TOGETHER AND THE COMMUNITY WILL.
MY COLLEAGUES IN CONGRESS HAVE 
BEEN INCREDIBLE ABOUT OFFERING 
THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR 
ENCOURAGEMENT AND CONDOLENCES 
BUT BEYOND THAT THERE IS AN 
OBLIGATION FOR EVERYONE TO DO 
THEIR PART GOING FORWARD TO TRY 
TO PREVENT MORE SHOOTINGS LIKE 
THIS.
WHAT'S SO AWFUL IS HOW COMMON 
THIS HAS BECOME, AND WE CAN'T BE
NUMB TO IT AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO WAIT UNTIL IT'S IN YOUR 
DISTRICT TO RESPOND.
>> I COULDN'T SAY IT BETTER, 
CONGRESSMAN.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN TOUCH WITH
EVERYBODY THERE ON THE SCENE 
RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU FOR SHARING A FEW 
MOMENTS OF YOUR TIME RIGHT NOW.
TOM LLAMAS HERE WITH US.
WE'RE NOW HEARING FROM THE 
BROWARD SHERIFF, TOM, THAT SO 
FAR, ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF, 
WE HAVE AT LEAST 14 VICTIMS.
VICTIMS CONTINUE TO BE 
TRANSFERRED TO BROWARD HEALTH 
CENTER AND BROWARD HEALTH NORTH 
HOSPITAL. 
>> NEARBY HOSPITALS THERE IN 
PARKLAND.
WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SET UP A 
STAGING AREA SO PARENTS CAN PICK
UP THEIR STUDENTS.
NOW THAT THEY HAVE THE GUNMAN, 
THE PERSON THEY BELIEVE TO BE 
THE GUNMAN, THAT YOUNG MAN 
WEARING THAT MAROON SHIRT, A LAW
ENFORCEMENT SOURCE TELLS ME HE 
WAS PICKED UP IN A NEARBY 
NEIGHBORHOOD. 
>> HE HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE 
SCHOOL?
>> THIS IS PRELIMINARY A
INFORMATION.
I WAS TOLD THAT HE WAS PICKED UP
NEAR THE SCHOOL AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO THE KNOWN ADDRESSES TO 
SEE WHAT THEY CAN FIND AND DO 
THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AS 
INVESTIGATORS.
PARENTS ARE NOW ALLOWED TO PICK 
UP THEIR KIDS. 
>> I'M JOINED ON THE PHONE NOW 
BY LIZETTE ROSEENBLAT.
YOUR DAUGHTER IS IN THE SCHOOL?
>> SHE CALLED ME ABOUT A 
HALF-HOUR OR 45 MINUTES AGO THAT
SHE'S OUT, THANK GOD.
THERE WERE 20 OR 30 MINUTES 
WHERE I DIDN'T HEAR FROM HER 
WHICH WAS NERVE RACKING.
OUR NEIGHBOR IS STILL INSIDE. 
>> STILL INSIDE THE SCHOOL?
>> AS OF 4:02 P.M. SHE WAS 
TELLING ME I THINK WE'RE BEING 
EVACUATED SOON BUT THAT'S WHAT I
THOUGHT 45 MINUTES AGO.
I'M IN ROOM 22.
WE HEARD THE FIRE ALARM.
WE WERE EVACUATED AT FIRST BUT 
WE SAW THE POLICE RUNNING WITH 
GUNS AND GUNSHOTS AND PEOPLE 
WERE SCREAMING SO WE RAN BACK 
INSIDE.
THAT'S FROM MY NEIGHBOR WHO IS 
15. 
>> WHAT MORE WERE YOU ABLE TO 
LEARN FROM YOUR DAUGHTER?
>> MY DAUGHTER TEXTED US, I 
DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TIMES 
ANYMORE, SOME TIME AROUND 2:30.
I URN FORNFORTUNATELY MISSED TH 
AND THE TEXT AND SHE TEXTED MY 
HUSBAND WHO WAS HOME THANK 
GOODNESS.
SHE SAID THERE WAS A SHOOTER IN 
THE SCHOOL.
HE TOLD HER TO REMAIN CALM AND 
EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE FINE.
HE HUNG UP WITH HER AND CALLED 
THE SCHOOL TO VERIFY.
IT WAS CONFIRMED AND HE TOOK OFF
IN HIS CAR.
OBVIOUSLY HE COULDN'T GET TO THE
SCHOOL BUT IN THE AREA.
HE PARKED BY A GAS STATION AND 
STARTED WALKING OVER THERE.
SHE IN THE MEANTIME WAS TEXTING 
ME.
SHE WAS TELLING ME -- SHE SAID 
SHE WAS FINE, THAT SHE WAS 
HIDING AND SHE KEPT BEGGING ME 
TO PLEASE CALL THE POLICE 
BECAUSE SHE WAS HEARING SOMEBODY
CRYING OUT FOR HELP.
SHE SAID SHE WAS -- SHE COULD 
HEAR THE PERSON.
WHEN I FINALLY SPOKE TO HER, SHE
ACTUALLY CALLED ME AND SAID IT 
WAS A SPANISH SPEAKING STUDENT 
AND HE WAS JUST CRYING AND SHE 
COULD HEAR THAT CALLING OUT.
SHE WAS SO WORRIED.
ALL I COULD SAY -- I TEXTED HER 
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.
I PROMISE YOU I'LL CALL THE 
POLICE, JUST KEEP HIDING.
I DID CALL 911.
I GAVE THEM THE DETAILS THAT I 
HAD.
THAT WAS AT 2:48 IN THE 
AFTERNOON.
I DIDN'T HEAR FROM HER AGAIN FOR
ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES AND IT 
WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING 
BECAUSE HER FRIENDS GOT OUT.
I KEPT GETTING CALLS FROM 
PARENTS OF FRIENDS OF HERS 
ASKING ME IF I HAD MY DAUGHTER 
AND I DIDN'T.
I HADN'T EVEN HEARD FROM HER.
I KEPT TEXTING WHERE ARE YOU AND
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE. 
>> THAT HAD TO BE THE LONGEST 30
MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE. 
>> IT WAS HORRIBLE.
WHEN SHE FINALLY CALLED ME THAT 
SHE WAS OKAY, AT THAT POINT MY 
OLDEST DAUGHTER HAD TAKEN OFF TO
GO GET MY HUSBAND WHO WAS NOT 
ALLOWED TO GET BACK TO HIS CAR I
THINK JUST BECAUSE IT'S TOTAL 
MADNESS IN PARKLAND RIGHT NOW, 
ALL THE S.W.A.T. AND THE POLICE 
AND EVERYTHING.
THEY JUST COULDN'T GET BACK TO 
WHERE THEY WERE.
SO I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THEY 
WERE BOTH GOING TO TALK WITH MY 
DAUGHTER, AND THEN I GET A TEXT 
FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S DAUGHTER 
SAYING THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT 
WITH THEM AND THAT SHE HAD 
WALKED TO ANOTHER FRIEND'S HOUSE
THE COMPLETELY OPPOSITE 
DIRECTION.
SO ABOUT 10, 15 MINUTES AGO I 
GET A PHONE CALL FROM MY 
DAUGHTER SAYING SHE'S AT HER 
FRIEND'S HOUSE ALONE HIDING.
I'M LIKE WHY ARE YOU ALONE AND 
HIDING.
AT THAT POINT SHE DIDN'T KNOW 
THAT THE SHOOTER HAD BEEN 
CAUGHT.
HER FRIEND FOR SOME REASON WAS 
SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THANKFULLY 
THE MOM GAVE HER THE GATE CODE 
OR THE GARAGE CODE TO GET IN.
MY DAUGHTER IS CURRENTLY IN 
SOMEONE'S HOME.
I MEAN IT'S A FRIEND'S HOME BUT 
SHE'S IN THERE AND SHE WAS 
PETRIFIED, STILL BY HERSELF.
I CALLED HER AND I SAID THE 
SHOOTER HAS BEEN CAUGHT.
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.
I'M LIKE, I PROMISE YOU.
ALL THESE KIDS THAT ARE OUT, 
THEY'RE STILL ABSOLUTELY 
TERRIFIED.
THEY DON'T HAVE INFORMATION, 
ESPECIALLY HER FRIEND THAT'S 
INSIDE THE BUILDING.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
SO I JUST TEXTED THE GIRL THAT'S
STILL INSIDE, LIKE DON'T WORRY, 
THE SHOOTER HAS BEEN CAUGHT.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HOME SAFE 
SOON.
HOPEFULLY NOW THAT THE SHOOTER 
HAS BEEN APPAPPREHENDED, THE KI 
CAN START MAKING THEIR WAY HOME.
>> AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HUG 
YOUR DAUGHTER. 
>> I CAN'T WAIT.
YOU NEVER THINK SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN YOUR 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
WE WERE VOTED ONE OF THE SAFEST 
CITIES YESTERDAY I THINK I READ 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THEN 
TODAY HERE WE ARE.
IT'S A SCARY SITUATION.
IT'S ALL ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND 
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING 
TO HAPPEN. 
>> ONE MORE REMINDER THAT NO 
PLACE IS SAFE.
WE'RE GLAD YOUR DAUGHTER IS 
SAFE.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME THIS 
AFTERNOON.
I WANT TO BRING IN SENATOR BILL 
NELSON RIGHT NOW.
SENATOR BILL NELSON, WE ARE 
SORRY FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
YOUR STATE RIGHT NOW.
PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU CAN AND 
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 
SHOOTING. 
>> GEORGE, IT'S A BAD DAY.
A NUMBER OF FATALITIES.
I WAS TOLD THAT BY THE SCHOOL 
SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
AND SUBSEQUENTLY I'VE JUST HEARD
HIM IN A LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE 
SAY THE SAME THING PUBLICLY.
AS TO THE NUMBER, I DON'T KNOW.
HE IMPLIED THAT IT WAS QUITE A 
NUMBER, BUT LET'S HOPE IT'S NOT.
IF YOU PRAY, YOU OUGHT TO PRAY 
FOR THESE STUDENTS AND THEIR 
SCHOOL AND THEIR PARENTS RIGHT 
NOW.
CERTAINLY OUR THOUGHTS GO OUT TO
THEM. 
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE 
BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFFS THAT 
THERE ARE AT LEAST 14 VICTIMS 
RIGHT NOW BUT WE BELIEVE THE 
SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.
THAT'S ALSO BEEN REPORTED.
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT 
THE SHOOTER?
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY 
INFORMATION?
>> IT IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION STILL BECAUSE THEY ARE
CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE WAS A 
SECOND OR THIRD SHOOTER.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION 
THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE 
SINCE THE SUSPECT, THEY THINK 
THEY HAVE HIM.
THE FBI IS LEADING THE EFFORT 
AND THEN OF COURSE THE 
INVESTIGATION.
THE FBI WILL LEAD THE 
INVESTIGATION WITH ALL OF LOCAL 
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
>> SENATOR, WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST 
THOUGHTS WHEN IT HITS HOME LIKE 
THIS?
>> IT'S A BAD DAY.
ONCE WE GET INTO THE 
INVESTIGATION, HOW DID HE 
ACQUIRE THE WEAPON, WAS IT HIGH 
CAL
CALIBER, WAS IT SOMETHING THAT 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
B
BUY, WAS THERE A BACKGROUND 
CHECK.
ALL THE THINGS THAT WHEN WE HEAR
ABOUT THESE MASS SHOOTINGS WE 
WONDER ABOUT AND IT'S HARD TO 
EVEN GET SOMETHING PUT INTO LAW 
LIKE THE ACTIVE TERRORIST WATCH 
LIST FROM BEING PREVENTED TO BUY
A GUN.
AGAIN, WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER ROUND 
OF ALL OF THIS DEBATE THAT THIS 
BRINGS TO MIND.
>> SENATOR, THE ROUNDS HAVE 
BECOME ALMOST RITUALISTIC.
WE GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS, DO 
THE INVESTIGATIONS, GRIEVE FOR 
THE VICTIMS, MOURN FOR THE 
FA
FAMILIES, AND IT HAPPENS AGAIN. 
>> GEORGE, YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.
WE KEEP SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
BUT THEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN. 
>> SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
TIME TODAY.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
I'M HERE WITH TOM LLAMAS AS WELL
AS WE'RE STILL SEEING THOSE 
SCENES AS THEY UNFOLDED EARLIER 
THIS AFTERNOON.
THE BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF 
REPORTS THERE ARE 14 VICTIMS.
WE DO BELIEVE THE SHOOTER IS IN 
CUSTODY ALTHOUGH AS THE SENATOR 
POINTS OUT, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
SAY THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION UNTIL THEY GO 
THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN THAT 
SCHOOL. 
>> POLICE ARE TELLING US THEY'RE
GOING ROOM BY ROOM.
IT'S A MASSIVE SCHOOL.
AS ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS TOLD 
YOU, THEY'RE GOING ROOM BY ROOM 
TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER 
POTENTIAL SHOOTERS.
POLICE BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE 
LONE GUNMAN IN CUSTODY BUT THEY 
ARE DOING THEIR DUE DELL 
GENTLE -- 
DILIGENCE GOING THROUGH THE 
SCHOOL.
PARENTS ARE NOW ALLOWED TO PICK 
UP THEIR CHILDREN AT A STAGING 
AREA.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS NOW 
FROM LOCAL MEDIA, DIFFERENT NEWS
OUTLETS REPORTING THAT THEY'RE 
INTERVIEWING STUDENTS ON THE 
SCENE AND THEY KNEW WHO THE 
GUNMAN WAS. 
>> WE'RE GETTING NEW VIDEO NOW 
WE WANT TO SHOW YOU.
I BELIEVE THIS IS COMING FROM 
INSIDE THE SCHOOL AS THE 
STUDENTS TRIED TO EVACUATE.
>> GO THE AUDITORIUM!
EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
EVERYBODY DOWN. 
>> FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE 
COMMISSIONER, RAY KELLY, ONE OF 
THE THINGS I'M STRUCK BY, HOW 
CALM PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO REMAIN 
AS THEY EVACUATED.
>> EXACTLY.
HOW ORDERLY IT IS.
AGAIN, THAT SORT OF SAYS THE 
MIND-SET OF STUDENTS THESE DAYS.
THIS IS NOW A RELATIVELY COMMON 
EXPERIENCE AND IT HAS TO BE ON 
THE MIND OF THE STUDENTS.
IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR 
DISCIPLINE AS WELL.
IT'S A SIGN OF THE TIMES.
>> SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT 
PIERRE THOMAS, WE HAVE THE 
SHOOTER IN CUSTODY ACCORDING TO 
LOCAL POLICE.
THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS WILL 
NOW KICK IN AS WELL BUT WE 
SHOULD EMPHASIZE AS YOU DID 
EARLIER, THE STUDENT WAS KNOWN 
TO OTHERS IN THE SCHOOL AND 
THERE'S BEEN NO SIGN AT ALL THIS
HAS ANY CONNECTION TO TERRORISM 
OF ANY KIND. 
>> NOT SO FAR, GEORGE, AND WE'VE
TALKED TO MULTIPLE FEDERAL 
SOURCES.
NO INDICATION OF TERRORISM.
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ISOLATED 
INCIDENT INVOLVING A DISTURBED 
YOUNG MAN.
GEORGE, I CAN GIVE SOME 
PERSPECTIVE TO OUR VIEWERS RIGHT
NOW AT HOME WHO ARE PROBABLY 
WONDERING HOW OFTEN THIS 
HAPPENS.
WE'RE AVERAGING ABOUT 300-PLUS 
MASS SHOOTINGS PER YEAR.
THE DEFINITION ACCORDING TO THE 
GUN VIOLENCE ARCHIVE IS FOUR OR 
MORE PEOPLE WOUNDED IN A SINGLE 
INCIDENT.
2017, 346 MASS SHOOTING 
INCIDENTS.
2016, 383 MASS SHOOTING 
INCIDENTS.
SO ALMOST ONCE A DAY SOMEONE IN 
THIS COUNTRY TAKES A WEAPON AND 
SHOOTS AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE.
>> AS WE'VE SAID, 18 SCHOOL 
SHOOTINGS JUST THIS YEAR ALONE.
VICK OQUENDO HAS NOW MADE HIS 
WAY TO THE SCHOOL.
YOU'RE ABOUT 500 FEET FROM THE 
SCHOOL?
>> THIS IS AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN 
GET RIGHT NOW TO THE SCHOOL, 
GEORGE.
JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK 
YOU'VE GOT LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST 
LINING EVERY SINGLE INCH OF THIS
AREA.
YOU'VE GOT STUDENTS AND PARENTS 
VERY CONCERNED.
I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO A FEW 
PARENTS ON THE WAY OVER HERE 
SAYING, LOOK, WE HEARD ABOUT 
THIS AND COULDN'T GET IN TOUCH 
WITH OUR SON OR DAUGHTER FOR 
ABOUT AN HOUR.
WE CAME RIGHT OVER HERE, AND 
THIS IS AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET 
RIGHT NOW.
THERE IS SOME RELIEF KNOWING 
THAT THERE IS A SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY RIGHT NOW. 
>> VICTOR, IF YOU LET ME 
INTERRUPT YOU, WE BELIEVE WHAT 
WE'RE SEEING ON THE SCENE IN 
THAT AMBULANCE, WE BELIEVE THE 
SHOOTER IS IN THAT AMBULANCE 
BEING TAKEN AWAY.
THE POLICE HAVE SAID THE SHOOTER
IS IN CUSTODY.
>> POLICE HAVE SAID THAT THE 
SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY AND OUR 
AFFILIATE WAS ALSO REPORTING 
THAT THEY'VE TAKEN A FAMILY 
MEMBER, POSSIBLY A SIBLING, 
MAYBE A BROTHER, FOR QUESTIONING
AS WELL.
THOSE ARE THE LATEST REPORTS 
HERE.
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, RIGHT 
NOW I'M JUST FEET AWAY FROM THE 
SCHOOL.
POLICE EVERYWHERE.
YOU CAN STILL HEAR SIRENS, 
REC
HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR AND 
STUDENTS IN TEARS OUT HERE. 
>> VICTOR, AS FAR AS YOU CAN 
TELL, ARE ALL THE STUDENTS OUT 
OF THE SCHOOL YET?
>> IT'S TOUGH TO SAY.
IT'S SUCH A BIG SCHOOL.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY 
WERE STILL GOING THROUGH IT BUT 
AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW IT DOES 
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DOING THEIR 
BEST TO ESCORT AS MANY STUDENTS 
AWAY, GETTING THEM DOWN TO A 
NEARBY PARK SO THEY CAN MEET UP 
WITH FAMILY.
>> YOU'RE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE
NOW OF A MAJOR SCHOOL SHOOTING 
IN SOUTH FLORIDA, PARKLAND, 
FLORIDA.
THAT'S VIDEO OF THE SHOOTER 
BELIEVED TO BE IN CUSTODY NOW, 
ACCORDING TO LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.
IT ALL BEGAN TO UNFOLD 2:20 P.M.
EASTERN TIME AT THE MARJORY 
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN 
PARKLAND.
IT'S A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL, TEN 
BUILDINGS, 3,000 STUDENTS.
ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES ON 
THE SCENE, THE SHOOTING BEGAN 
AROUND 2:20 WITH THE SOUND OF 
WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GARBAGE 
TRUCK BACKING UP AND FOUR TO SIX
MINUTES OF SHOTS.
THAT'S VIDEO OF STUDENTS BEING 
EVACUATED FROM INSIDE.
THE EVACUATIONS WENT ON FOR MORE
THAN AN HOUR.
ACCORDING TO OUR EYE WITNESS, 
THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT FOUR TO 
SIX MINUTES OF SHOOTING.
THIS IS A MASS CASUALTY EVENT, 
AT LEAST 14 INJURED, REPORTS OF 
AT LEAST ONE FATALITY.
WE'VE HEARD THAT TWO OTHER 
VICTIMS WERE SEEN DEAD ON THE 
GROUND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM.
THERE YOU SEE PICTURES OF SOME 
OF THE INJURED BEING TAKEN AWAY 
JUST MOMENTS AGO.
WE SAW AERIAL FOOTAGE OF THE 
SHOOTER BEING TAKEN AWAY IN 
CUSTODY IN AN AMBULANCE DRIVING 
DOWN THE HIGHWAY.
BRAD GARRETT, ONE OF THE THINGS 
WE JUST HEARD AS WELL FROM 
VICTOR OQUENDO IS THAT A FAMILY 
MEMBER OF THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE 
ALSO BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR
QUESTIONING AGAIN.
STANDARD PRACTICE. 
>> IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE, 
GEORGE, BUT WHAT DOES HE KNOW?
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO KNOW AT 
THE VERY LEAST SOMETHING ABOUT 
THE WEAPONS.
IF THEY LIVE TOGETHER IN THE 
SAME HOUSE, HE MAY HAVE HAD 
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS BROTHER 
ABOUT HIS ANGER, RAGE, HIS 
DISAPP
DISAPPOINTMENT, HIS FEELING THAT
HE CAN'T CONTROL HIS LIFE.
I GUESS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO 
IS IF HE ACTUALLY TALKED TO HIM 
ABOUT PLANNING THIS.
THAT OBVIOUSLY REMAINS TO BE 
SCENE. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
CHIEF DAVID BROWN NOW JOINING US
IN DALLAS AS WELL.
THE SHOOTER IN CUSTODY BUT MUCH 
MORE POLICE WORK LEFT TO BE 
DONE.
>> THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF 
THE POLICE WORK STARTS NOW WITH 
TRYING TO FIND MOTIVES, TRYING 
TO FIND CUPLPABILITY THROUGH TH 
INTERROGATION OF THE SUSPECT.
IT MAY BE A LONG SEVERAL DAYS OF
INVESTIGATION BEFORE WE FIGURE 
OUT ANY OF WHAT'S HAPPENED 
TODAY.
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, 
ALONG WITH NOTIFYING THESE 
PARENTS OF THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN LOST IN THIS 
TRAGEDY, ALONG WITH WHAT I'VE 
HEARD EARLIER IS THAT MAYBE A 
TEACHER OR OTHER ADULTS MAY HAVE
BEEN LOST IN THIS TRAGEDY AS 
WELL.
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF 
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF IT. 
>> CHIEF, THANKS VERY MUCH.
I WANT TO BRING IN MATTHEW 
WALKER, A 17-YEAR-OLD JR. UNIOR.
MATT, WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
TELL US ABOUT YOUR AFTERNOON.
>> I WAS IN CLASS.
IT'S THE LAST PERIOD OF THE DAY.
I WAS JUST DOING MY WORK, KIND 
OF NEAR THE END OF THE BELL.
OUT OF NOWHERE I HEAR BANGING IN
THE HALLWAYS.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SOME KID 
MESSING AROUND BUT IT GOT LOUDER
AND LOUDER.
THE GUY STARTED SHOOTING THROUGH
LIKE THE LITTLE WINDOW, THROUGH 
THE DOOR.
IT WAS REALLY LOUD.
THERE WERE BULLET HOLES 
EVERYWHERE.
EVERYONE WAS FREAKING OUT. 
>> CAN I STOP YOU THERE, MATT.
COULD YOU SEE THE SHOOTER?
>> I DID NOT SEE THE SHOOTER BUT
I DID -- HE DID SHOOT THROUGH MY
CLASS.
>> HE SHOT INTO YOUR CLASSROOM.
WAS ANYBODY HIT?
>> YES, THERE WERE KIDS INJURED,
BUT HE COULDN'T GET INSIDE 
BECAUSE THE DOOR WAS LOCKED BUT 
HE WAS SHOOTING THROUGH THE 
GLASS.
>> COULD YOU TELL HOW FAR AWAY 
HE WAS FROM THE DOOR?
>> I CANNOT.
I COOPEULDN'T SEE HIM. 
>> ABOUT HOW MANY SHOTS DID HE 
FIRE INTO THE CLASSROOM?
>> I'D PROBABLY SAY 10 TO 12.
A LOT. 
>> THOSE 10 OR 12 SHOTS, EVEN 
THOUGH I'M SURE IT HAPPENED 
QUICKLY, IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE 
FOREVER. 
>> AFTER THAT HE KIND OF JUST 
WENT TO OTHER CLASSES AND DID 
THE SAME THING.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE AT 
ALL -- GO AHEAD.
>> HE WAS JUST GOING CLASS TO 
CLASS JUST SHOOTING AT RANDOM 
KIDS.
WHEN THE POLICE WERE ESCORTING 
ME OUT OF THE BUILDING, THERE 
WAS A DEAD -- I DON'T KNOW IF HE
WAS DEAD OR NOT BUT THERE WAS A 
DEAD GUY ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO 
ME. 
>> HOW LONG DID YOU HEAR 
SHOOTING GOING ON?
>> TWO MINUTES.
TWO, THREE MINUTES.
>> THEN HE JUST KEPT WALKING 
FROM CLASSROOM TO CLASSROOM.
TELL US ABOUT THE CONDITION OF 
THE STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM 
WITH YOU.
>> MOSTLY EVERYONE WAS OKAY IN 
MY CLASS BUT A FEW KIDS WERE 
INJURED.
>> NOT SERIOUSLY?
>> I THINK ONE WAS SERIOUS BUT 
THE OTHERS, I DON'T KNOW.
>> TELL US WHAT HAPPENED 
AFTERWARDS.
WHEN WERE YOU ABLE TO GET OUT OF
THE CLASSROOM?
>> THE COPS CAME IN LIKE FIVE 
MINUTES, SO THEY WERE QUICK 
ABOUT IT WHEN THEY GOT HERE AND 
EVERYONE WAS, LIKE, CLEAR, THEY 
CAME IN OUR CLASS, MADE SURE WE 
WERE ALL OKAY AND EVACUATED ALL 
OF US.
>> SINCE YOU'VE BEEN OUT, HAVE 
YOU HEARD ANYTHING MORE ABOUT 
THE SHOOTER OR ABOUT YOUR 
FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES IN THE 
SCHOOL?
>> WELL, I HEARD THAT THE 
SHOOTER WAS A FORMER STUDENT AT 
DOUGLAS.
HE HAS AN INSTAGRAM AND 
EVERYTHING HE POSTS IS ABOUT 
WEAPONS.
IT'S SICK.
>> TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT 
INSTAGRAM FROM THE FORMER 
STUDENT.
>> WELL, I ONLY SAW A PICTURE OF
IT BUT ALL HE DOES IS HE'S JUST 
POSTING HIS WEAPONS AND STUFF ON
HIS INSTAGRAM, KIND OF LIKE 
SHOWING OFF HIS KNIVES AND GUNS 
AND STUFF LIKE THAT. 
>> AND YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE 
SOME VIDEO.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO 
SHOW THIS RIGHT NOW.
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING?
>> I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE CLASS AND HE JUST STARTED 
SHOOTING THROUGH THE DOOR AT THE
KIDS. 
>> THAT IS A LOT OF SHOTS IN A 
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, JUST A 
TERRIFYING FEW MOMENTS THERE, 
MATTHEW.
>> IT WAS AWFUL.
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW?
>> I'M OKAY, I'M WITH MY MOM.
WE'RE SAFE.
>> HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ANY OF 
YOUR OTHER CLASSMATES?
ARE YOUR FRIENDS OKAY?
>> SO FAR ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE 
OKAY.
I HOPE -- I JUST HOPE EVERYONE, 
YOU KNOW, GOES THROUGH IT AND 
JUST PRAY, YOU KNOW.
I'M BLESSED TO BE ALIVE.
>> YOU ARE BLESSED TO BE ALIVE.
MATTHEW, THANK YOU FOR SHARING 
THAT WITH US.
GO HUG YOUR MOM.
I KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH TIME BUT 
THANK YOU FOR TELLING US WHAT 
HAPPENED, FOR GIVING US THAT 
SCENE INSIDE THE CLASSROOM.
I'M HERE WITH TOM LLAMAS AND RAY
KELLY.
IT JUST SHOWS, BOY, WHEN YOU GET
INSIDE THAT CLASSROOM, PUT 
YOURSELF IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF 
THOSE YOUNG STUDENTS.
AS MATTHEW SAID, THIS IS THE END
OF THE DAY, THEY'RE WRAPPING UP 
THEIR DAY AND THEN GUNSHOTS 
THROUGH THE DOOR OF YOUR 
CLASSROOM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
HE SEEMS VERY CALM AND 
COLLECTED.
WHAT A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT
IS.
HE'LL HAVE IT FOR THE REST OF 
HIS LIFE.
THANK GOD THOSE DOORS WITHHELD 
THE SHOOTING OR HIS ATTEMPT TO 
GET IN.
SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO 
SHOOT THROUGH THE GLASS. 
>> WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS
ALL DAY.
THE DOORS LOCKED IMMEDIATELY, 
ALL THE STUDENTS FOLLOWING THE 
TRAINING THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN AND 
THAT SAVES LIVES. 
>> NOT ONLY THAT BUT THAT THE 
STUDENTS REALIZED IMMEDIATELY 
WHAT HAPPENS.
USUALLY WHEN WE COVER THESE MASS
SHOOTINGS, ADULTS WILL TELL YOU 
IT SOUNDED LIKE FIREWORKS, IT 
SOUNDED LIKE THE BACK OF A CAR 
OR SOMETHING BUT THESE STUDENTS 
HAVE NOW LIVED THROUGH SO MANY 
OF THESE SHOOTINGS.
THEY'VE SEEN IT ON TELEVISION 
SINCE THEY WERE BORN ALMOST.
WE'VE HAD SO MANY SCHOOL 
SHOOTINGS.
THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING 
ELSE.
A PATTERN IS STARTING TO EMERGE 
FROM THE STUDENTS WHO WERE IN 
THAT SCHOOL CLAIMING -- AND IT'S
STILL EARLY BUT CLAIMING THAT 
THIS WAS POSSIBLY A STUDENT OR A
FORMER STUDENT.
THAT MAY EXPLAIN HOW THE SHOOTER
GOT INTO THE SCHOOL IN THE FIRST
PLACE. 
>> WE DID HEAR FROM MATTHEW 
WALKER THAT DETAIL OF THE 
INSTAGRAM OF THAT FORMER STUDENT
SHOWING OFF GUNS, WEAPONS, 
KNIVES.
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE AMBULANCE
THAT WAS TRANSPORTING THE 
SHOOTER, NOW PULLING UP TO THE 
HOSPITAL.
WE COULDN'T TELL FROM THE 
EARLIER VIDEO OF HIM IF HE HAD 
BEEN INJURED.
TOM, ARE WE LEARNING MORE ABOUT 
THAT?
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ASK MY 
SOURCES WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, IF
HE WAS INJURED.
HE DIDN'T LOOK INJURED BUT IT 
LOOKED LIKE HE HAD TROUBLE 
STANDING UP.
IN FLORIDA THEY HAVE THE BAKER 
ACT WHERE WHEN POLICE THINK 
SOMEBODY IS MENTALLY ILL THEY 
CAN TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL 
IMMEDIATELY.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT 
HAPPENED HERE BUT IT'S A STATE 
LAW IN FLORIDA.
WE KNOW HE HAD SOME TROUBLE 
STANDING UP AFTER THE SHOOTING. 
>> WHOEVER THAT WAS IS NOW BEING
WHEELED INTO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT 
THERE.
PIERRE THOMAS, OF COURSE ATF IS 
GOING TO GET INVOLVED AND TRY TO
FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THESE 
WEAPONS.
>> IT WILL BE A HUGE PRIORITY, 
GEORGE, AND THEY CAN TYPICALLY 
FIND OUT WITHIN 24 HOURS OR LESS
WHERE THESE GUNS CAME FROM, IF 
THEY WERE BOUGHT LOCALLY, IF 
THEY CAME FROM PARENTS OR 
FRIENDS.
THAT WILL BE A KEY ELEMENT IN 
HELPING THEM PUT TOGETHER THE 
PICTURE OF HOW THIS WENT DOWN.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SOURCES 
ARE SAYING ALREADY, GEORGE, IS 
THAT GUNS ARE SO WIDELY 
AVAILABLE, THAT WILL BE A PART 
OF THE STORY BUT SOMETHING THAT 
THEY EXPECT THAT THIS PERSON HAD
EASY ACCESS TO THE WEAPONS, 
GEORGE. 
>> WE HAVE MORE VIDEO COMING IN 
NOW OF ONE OF THE STUDENTS AT 
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL SPEAKING 
ABOUT A TEACHER WHO WAS INJURED.
>> WHAT HAPPENED?
>> HE WAS SHOT.
EVERYONE GOT OUT OF THE CLASSES 
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE
DRILL.
BUT THEN -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED.
JUST EVERYONE STARTED RUNNING 
BACK TO THE CLASS AND THEN I 
JUST RAN. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR TEACHER'S NAME?
>> MR. BEAGLE.
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WAS SHOT?
>> BECAUSE WE SAW HIS BODY FOR 
LIKE 30 MINUTES.
WE WERE JUST LIKE PRAYING AND 
CRYING AND -- AND THEN THE 
POLICE CAME AND WE JUST GOT OUT.
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO SHOT HIM?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
I JUST SAW HIS HEAD BECAUSE HE 
WAS BLOCKING THE DOOR SO THE 
DOOR WAS OPEN ALL THE TIME.
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE ALIVE.
>> ONE OF THE STUDENTS THERE AT 
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL, HER TEACHER
WAS SHOT.
WE DID GET SOME VIDEO JUST 
MOMENTS AGO FROM MATTHEW WALKER,
A STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL WHO WAS 
IN ONE OF THE CLASSROOMS WHERE 
THE SHOOTER STARTED SHOOTING 
INSIDE THE CLASSROOM THROUGH A 
LOCKED DOOR.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> APPEARS TO BE MORE THAN A 
DOZEN SHOTS.
I WANT TO BRING IN FORMER 
SPECIAL AGENT BRAD GARRETT.
THE STORIES ARE LINING UP RIGHT 
NOW FROM SEVERAL EYE WITNESSES.
WHAT STARTED AS SOME KIND OF A 
BOOM OR A COMMOTION FOLLOWED BY 
SHOTS AND THEN THE SHOOTER GOING
METHODICALLY FROM CLASSROOM TO 
CLASSROOM FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, 
THANKFULLY AT TIMES FINDING 
LOCKED DOORS WHICH LIMITED THE 
INJURIES. 
>> EXACTLY.
IT REMINDED ME IMMEDIATELY, 
GEORGE, OF VIRGINIA TECH.
HE CHAINED THE DOOR SHUT SO 
POLICE COULDN'T GET IN AND WENT 
METHODICALLY ROOM TO ROOM AND HE
WAS ABLE OBVIOUSLY TO GET INTO 
THE CLASSROOMS.
LOCKED DOORS OR REINFORCED DOORS
I'M SURE SAVED A NUMBER OF SAVES
TODAY.
>> AND WE'VE SEEN SO MANY SCHOOL
DISTRICTS NOW IMPLEMENT SO MANY 
SECURITY MEASURES BECAUSE OF THE
PREVALENCE OF SHOOTINGS LIKE 
THIS.
>> THEY HAVE.
THE CHALLENGE, GEORGE, IS LOOK 
AT THIS SCHOOL PHYSICALLY AS WE 
HAVE AERIAL VIEWS OF IT.
YOU LITERALLY COULDN'T SORT OF 
CHOKE THIS INTO THE SCHOOL AND 
EFFECTIVELY HAVE THE SCHOOL 
FUNCTION DAY IN AND DAY OUT.
THE ABILITY TO CONTROL WEAPONS, 
KNIVES, ET CETERA INTO A SCHOOL 
BECAUSE OF THE FLUID NATURE OF A
SCHOOL IS A REALLY BIG CHALLENGE
WHICH REALLY THEN GOES TO THE 
FOLLOWING.
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO 
STOP MASS SHOOTERS, WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH 
WEAPON RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE IT'S
JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
REALISTICALLY.
IT'S ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS AND 
ALSO AS THEY IDENTIFY TROUBLED 
KIDS, MASS SHOOTER OR NOT, 
POTENTIAL DOWN THE ROAD, YOU 
ADDRESS IT AND DEAL WITH IT. 
>> THAT GETS TO THE NEXT THING I
WANTED TO ASK YOU.
WE'VE ONLY HEARD THIS FROM ONE 
STUDENT, MATTHEW WALKER TALKING 
ABOUT HE HAD HEARD THAT THE 
FORMER STUDENT BELIEVED TO BE 
THE SHOOTER HAD AN INSTAGRAM 
ACCOUNT WHERE HE WAS DISPLAYING 
WEAPONS, GUNS AND KNIVES. 
>> HE'S SHOWING OFF ABOUT WHAT 
HE'S GOING TO DO AND HE'S GOING 
TO TAKE ON THE POWER.
CHO DID THE SAME THING.
REMEMBER THAT FOOTAGE HE SENT TO
NBC BACK IN 2007 OF WHAT HE HAD,
WHAT HE WAS GOING TO USE 
POTENTIALLY.
IT CAME AFTER THE FACT OBVIOUSLY
BUT THAT'S PART OF THE POWER 
BUILDUP FOR THESE GUYS.
THEY WANT US TO KNOW, THEY WANT 
CERTAIN PEOPLE TO KNOW THEY'RE 
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS 
AND THOSE OF YOU THAT I DON'T 
LIKE HAVE BELITTLED ME, WHATEVER
IS IN HIS HEAD AS TO WHY HE WAS 
JUSTIFIED IN COMMITTING THE 
SHOOTING, I'M COMING AFTER YOU. 
>> WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN A STUDENT
SEES AN INSTAGRAM POST LIKE 
THAT, WHEN I TEACHER SEES AN 
INSTAGRAM POST LIKE THAT, WHAT'S
NEXT?
>> WHAT'S NEXT, GEORGE, YOU 
REPORT THAT TO SOMEBODY IN THE 
SCHOOL.
MANY SCHOOLS TODAY, GEORGE, 
PARTICULARLY IN VIRGINIA BECAUSE
OF VIRGINIA TECH ACTUALLY HAVE 
THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS.
THEY'RE USUALLY MADE UP OF THE 
COMMUNITY POLICE RESOURCE 
OFFICER ASSIGNED TO THE SCHOOL, 
A PSYCHOLOGY, PEOPLE FROM THE 
SCHOOL AND MAYBE SOME STUDENTS.
AS THEY HEAR ABOUT TROUBLED 
KIDS -- LET'S FACE IT, THEY HAVE
TROUBLES, THEY HAVE ISSUES, THEY
DON'T GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE, 
THEY'RE MAD.
SOME OF THAT'S GOT TO BE 
ADDRESSED ON THE FRONT END.
IT'S A COMBINATION OF 
IDENTIFYING KIDS THAT NEED HELP 
BUT MOST IMPORTANT, THAT 
INFORMATION GETS TO THE STAFF 
AND MAYBE THE POLICE OFFICER AT 
THE SCHOOL.
YOU GOT A KID THAT'S FLASHING 
GUNS ON INSTAGRAM, YOU GOT TO 
ADDRESS IT. 
>> STEVE GOMEZ, ALSO A FORMER 
FBI SPECIAL AGENT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN 
PUZZLING US IS WE FIRST HEARD 
THAT THE SHOOTER WAS INSIDE THE 
SCHOOL, PERHAPS IN THE FRESHMAN 
BUILDING, BUT WE SAW HIM BEING 
ARRESTED LOOKS LIKE A COUPLE OF 
BLOCKS AWAY.
>> YES.
AND THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN WHEN 
YOU RESPOND TO THIS TYPE OF 
SITUATION, YOU WANT TO TRY TO 
CREATE A PERIMETER TO WHERE 
NOBODY CAN GET OUT, ESPECIALLY 
THE SUSPECT, AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE SUSPECT WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT 
OUT INTO A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD.
IT WAS PROBABLY AN ESSENTIAL 
PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS 
GIVEN TO THE POLICE BY ONE OF 
THE STUDENTS OR FACULTY THAT 
PROBABLY LED THEM TO ONE OF 
THOSE LOCATIONS.
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE INVESTIGATION
BEARS OUT, BUT THE POLICE 
CLEARLY DID A GREAT JOB IN 
APPREHENDING HIM OUTSIDE OF 
THEIR PERIMETER FROM WHAT IT 
LOOKS LIKE. 
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW HE 
COULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE 
SCHOOL, CERTAINLY HARD TO 
IMAGINE HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT
WITH ANY WEAPONS. 
>> THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO PIECE TOGETHER THE 
TIMELINE OF THE EVENTS FROM THE 
FIRST SHOOTING ALL THE WAY TO 
THE LAST.
DID HE GO IN THERE AND WAS HE 
TARGETING A CERTAIN CLASS OR 
CERTAIN GROUP OF STUDENTS.
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS A 
FORMER STUDENT, DID HE HAVE SOME
KIND OF PROBLEMS TO WHERE HE 
JUST WENT IN THERE TO TARGET 
CERTAIN PEOPLE AND THEN TRIED TO
GET OUT OF THERE.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO
BE PART OF THE INVESTIGATION AND
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO MOVE ON
THAT QUICKLY. 
>> AS WE SAID, A SHOOTER IS IN 
CUSTODY RIGHT NOW.
TOM LLAMAS, WE'RE LEARNING BITS 
AND PIECES NOW ABOUT THAT YOUNG 
MAN.
>> WE'RE HEARING FROM THE ONE 
EYE WITNESS WHO TOLD US HE 
THINKS IT WAS A FORMER STUDENT.
OTHER STUDENTS ARE TELLING OTHER
OUTLETS THAT IT WAS A FORMER 
STUDENT, A STUDENT WHO WENT 
THERE.
SOME REPORTS EVEN SAY A TROUBLED
STUDENT.
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME 
CONFLICTING INFORMATION FROM 
WHAT THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS SAID
AS FAR AS WERE THERE ANY WARNING
SIGNS AND OTHER REPORTS THAT ARE
CIRCULATING AROUND THERE, 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S SO HARD TO 
PREPARE FOR A SITUATION LIKE 
THIS OR EVEN PREDICT ANYTHING 
LIKE THIS HAPPENING EVEN THOUGH 
WE HAVE COVERED SO MANY OF THESE
BUT SOMETHING I DO WANT TO SAY 
AN UPDATE FROM SENATOR MARCO 
RUBIO WHO APPARENTLY HAS BEEN 
BRIEFED ON THE SITUATION.
GEORGE, THIS IS A VERY GRIM 
TWEET.
HE WRITES, JUST SPOKE TO BROWARD
SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT.
TODAY IS THAT TERRIBLE DAY YOU 
PRAY NEVER COMES.
>> IT HAS COME TO BROWARD 
COUNTY, PARKLAND, FLORIDA.
MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH 
SCHOOL.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE 
STUDENTS, ZACHARY WELLS, AN ROTC
STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL.
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WERE 
ABLE TO SEE AND HEAR AND WHERE 
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. 
>> YES, I WAS LEADING SOME KIDS 
OUT FROM THE CLASSROOM.
WE WERE HEADING OVER TOWARDS THE
1300 BUILDING WHICH IS WHERE THE
SHOTS HAPPENED.
I HEARD TWO OR THREE SHOTS, AND 
SOME CUSTODY CAME UP SAYING TO 
GO THE OTHER WAY.
SO WE RAN BACK INTO OUR 
CLASSROOM AND BARRICADED 
OURSELVES IN THERE.
THE POLICE EVENTUALLY CAME AND 
GOT US AND NOW I'M OUT ON THE 
STREET JUST TRYING TO GET HOME 
SAFE. 
>> HOW MANY SHOTS DID YOU HEAR 
FIRED OR COULD YOU HEAR 
ANYTHING?
>> I HEARD TWO OR THREE SHOTS 
AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE
FIREWORKS.
I SAW THE CUSTODIANS AND THERE 
WAS ONE KID A LITTLE FURTHER 
AHEAD OF ME.
I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE 
FIREWORKS AT FIRST AND THEN 
REALIZED THEY WERE GUNSHOTS.
EVERYONE SPRINTED BACK TO THE 
CLASSROOM AND WE BARRICADED 
OURSELVES BACK UP IN THERE. 
>> AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WAS THE 
SHOOTING CONTAINED TO THAT ONE 
BUILDING?
>> I BELIEVE IT STAYED IN THAT 
AREA, YES, AND THEN FROM WHAT I 
HEARD HE DROPPED HIS RIFLE AND 
HE MADE HIS WAY OUT WITH THE 
OTHER STUDENTS THAT WERE BEING 
EVACUATED.
HE WALKED OVER TO WYNDHAM LAKES 
WHICH IS PRETTY NEAR.
I LIVE IN WYNDHAM LAKES, AND HE 
WAS ARRESTED AT A COMMON LITTLE 
MUD HOLE THERE.
IT'S A FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT 
AREA.
>> WE ACTUALLY SAW THE VIDEO OF 
HIM BEING ARRESTED.
WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO NAME THE 
SHOOTER JUST YET BUT YOU SAY YOU
BELIEVE YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS, YOU
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS FORMER
STUDENT?
>> YES, I KNOW WHO IT WAS.
WE GOT A PICTURE OF HIM AND WE 
WERE ACTUALLY SENDING IT AROUND 
TO THE DIFFERENT OFFICERS TO TRY
AND GET THE PHOTO OUT TO THEM 
AND GET HIM APPREHENDED FAIRLY 
QUICK. 
>> YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM 
WITH THE GUN IN HIS HAND?
>> NO.
WE HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM, A 
COMPOSITE PHOTO FROM A PREVIOUS 
YEAR THAT HE WAS IN FROM BEING 
AT THE SCHOOL. 
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS THAT 
PERSON?
>> ONE OF THE KIDS IN THE CLASS,
COLTON HATCH, WAS ON THE PHONE 
WITH ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS 
AND HE GAVE INFORMATION OF HIS 
NAME AND WE LOOKED FOR HIS NAME 
AND FOUND A VERY SIMILAR ONE AND
FOUND A PICTURE OF HIM IN A 
SCHOOL COMPOSITE PHOTO AND SENT 
IT OUT TO THE OFFICERS. 
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS 
FORMER STUDENT PERSONALLY?
>> I DID NOT KNOW HIM 
PERSONALLY.
I HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE BUT I HAD 
NOT TALKED TO HIM OR REALLY 
KNOWN HIM AT ALL.
>> SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW HUMUCH ABT
HIM?
>> I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM.
ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID HE USED 
TO FOLLOW HIM ON A SOCIAL MEDIA 
ACCOUNT WHERE HE WOULD REGULARLY
POST VIDEOS OF HIM WITH GUNS AND
KNIVES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM OTHERS 
AS WELL, FROM MATTHEW WALKER, 
ANOTHER STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL.
TO EMPHASIZE, AS FAR AS YOU 
KNOW, THIS IS A FORMER STUDENT 
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL?
>> YES, HE WAS A FORMER STUDENT.
ONE OF MY TEACHERS SAID 
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM EITHER 
TRANSFERRING OR BEING KICKED OUT
OF THE SCHOOL.
I'M NOT SURE WHICH IT WAS, BUT 
YES, HE DID USED TO GO TO OUR 
SCHOOL.
>> ZACHARY WELLS, THANKS VERY 
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
BRAD GARRETT, I WANT TO GO BACK 
TO -- EXCUSE ME, NOW WE'RE JUST 
GETTING VIDEO OF SHERIFF ISRAEL 
ON THE SCENE THERE FROM WPLG.
LET'S LISTEN.
>> I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING
THIS IS A CATASTROPHIC, AN 
UNBELIEVABLY CATASTROPHIC DAY IN
BROWARD COUNTY HISTORY.
IT'S DEVASTATING.
I'M SICK TO MY STOMACH.
WE HAVE MULTIPLE CASUALTIES.
WE'VE HAD APPROXIMATELY 14 
PEOPLE TRANSPORTED TO AREA 
HOSPITALS WITH VARYING DEGREES 
OF INJURIES.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE CASUALTIES 
THOUGH.
THERE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE LOST 
THEIR LIVES.
I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER RIGHT 
NOW.
IT'S A FLUID SCENE RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE MULTIPLE S.W.A.T. TEAMS 
CLEARING ALL THE BUILDINGS.
IF ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT 
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL, 
IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCHOOLS 
IN BROWARD COUNTY.
IT'S HUGE.
IT'S A HUGE CAMPUS.
WE HAVE MULTIPLE S.W.A.T. TEAMS 
CLEARING EVERY BUILDING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER 
SHOOTERS.
WE HAVE A SHOOTER IN CUSTODY.
HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY I 
BELIEVE ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER HE 
LEFT STONEMAN DOUGLAS, AFTER HE 
COMMITTED THIS HORRIFIC 
HOMICIDAL DETESTABLE ACT.
THE FBI AND OUR CRIME SCENE 
PEOPLE ARE ON THE SCENE OF THIS 
HORRIFIC SCENE AS FAR AS THE 
BUILDINGS ARE CLEARED.
RIGHT NOW THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT 
SAFE TO BE CLEARED.
WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU PUT OUT ON
THE NEWS ASAP THAT ANY PARENT 
WHO'S LOOKING FOR THEIR CHILD TO
PLEASE GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE 
MARRIOTT WITHIN THE HERRON BAY 
COMPLEX.
OUR DEPUTIES AND OTHER POLICE 
OFFICERS ARE TRANSPORTING THESE 
YOUNG STUDENTS OVER TO HERRON 
BAY TO BE REUNITED WITH THEIR 
PARENTS.
THAT'S WHERE WE WANT PARENTS TO 
GO.
I WANT TO THANK MAYOR DEAN, 
COMMISSIONER SHARIF AND 
MR. RUNSY FOR BEING HERE TO 
SUPPORT THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE AND TO BE WITH ME AT THIS
LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THIS
IS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR PARKLAND, 
BROWARD COUNTY, STATE OF FLORIDA
AND THE UNITED STATES.
MY VERY OWN TRIPLETS WENT TO 
THAT SCHOOL AND GRADUATED FROM 
STONEMAN DOUGLAS.
THEY PLAYED FOOTBALL AND 
LACROSSE AT THAT SCHOOL, SO IT'S
JUST CATASTROPHIC.
THERE REALLY ARE NO WORDS, AND 
WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED.
HAVE SPOKEN TO GOVERNOR SCOTT.
HE'S OUT OF STATE.
HE'S ON HIS WAY OVER HERE.
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND HE'S OFFERED THE FULL POWER 
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS.
ANY QUESTIONS?
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
>> E LABLABORATE ON THE SHOOTER?
>> HE WAS FOUND OFF CAMPUS.
 I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE.
I BELIEVE HE WAS FOUND IN THE 
CITY OF HALL SPRINGS BY A 
COCONUT BEACH, COCONUT CREEK 
POLICE OFFICER.
IT THAT'S UNCONFIRMED RIGHT NOW.
>> AGE RANGE OF THOSE -- 
>> I CAN'T.
>> WAS HE AN OUTSIDER?
>> FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THERE
WAS A TIME WHERE HE DID ATTEND 
THIS SCHOOL.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE LEFT.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE LEFT.
THAT IS CORRECT, HE'S NOT A 
CURRENT STUDENT. 
>> WAS THERE ANY CONFRONTATION 
BETWEEN HIM AND POLICE?
>> I WASN'T THERE BUT I WAS TOLD
THERE WAS NO CONFRONTATION.
HE WAS -- CAN YOU HEAR ME?
HE WAS TAKEN INTO ARREST WITHOUT
INCIDENT.
YES.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN 
CUSTODY?
>> NO.
ONE.
>> OKAY.
DO YOU HAVE AN AGE ON HIM?
>> I BELIEVE HE'S APPROXIMATELY 
18 YEARS OLD. 
>> OKAY.
THEN AT LEAST ONE DEAD?
>> MULTIPLE. 
>> MULTIPLE.
MORE THAN ONE?
>> YOU SAID THE SCHOOL IS NOT 
SAFE RIGHT NOW.
ARE THERE STILL CHILDREN INSIDE?
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WE BELIEVE -- WE BELIEVE AT THIS
POINT THAT ALL CHILDREN THAT WE 
KNOW ABOUT ARE CLEARED AND ARE 
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.
HOWEVER, WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE 
ARE INJURED PEOPLE.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE 
PEOPLE HIDING.
WE DON'T KNOW.
SO WE WILL NOT BEGIN TO RELEASE 
INFORMATION OR BEGIN TO OPEN UP 
THE CRIME SCENE UNTIL THE 
S.W.A.T. COMPONENTS SAY THE 
SCHOOL IS SAFE AND CLEAR.
WHEN I HEAR ALL CLEAR, WE'LL 
BEGIN THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> ARE ANY TEACHERS DEAD OR ONLY
STUDENTS?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA. 
>> HAVE YOU HEARD OF MR. -- 
>> NO -- 
>> INJURIES, APPROXIMATELY HOW 
MANY?
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY 
INJURIES THERE WERE.
WE KNOW 14 PEOPLE WERE 
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITALS 
WITH VARYING DEGREES OF WOUNDS.
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL WAIT FOR 
THE SCHOOL TO BE CLEARED.
WE'LL GO ON TO THE NEXT PHASE.
I KNOW THIS IS CRITICALLY 
IMPORTANT, RELEASE INFORMATION 
TO BROWARD COUNTY AND WE WILL 
KEEP YOU UP TO DATE, BUT FOR 
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO MORE 
INFORMATION ON -- 
>> TALK ABOUT WHERE THE SHOOTER 
WAS, WAS HE INSIDE -- 
>> HE WAS OUTSIDE AND INSIDE AT 
VARYING TIMES.
HE CERTAINLY WAS INSIDE. 
>> THERE'S SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL 
OF BROWARD COUNTY.
RECAPPING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
SOUTH FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON, A 
MASS SHOOTING UNFOLDED AROUND 
2:20 AT THE MARJORY STONEMAN 
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN PARKLAND 
FLORIDA.
THE SHERIFF JUST SAID, AT LEAST 
14 INJURED HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO 
LOCAL HOSPITALS, MULTIPLE 
FATALITIES PPT.
DON'T HAVE A CONFIRMED NUMBER.
A SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY.
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY OUTSIDE OF 
THE SCHOOL WITHOUT INCIDENT.
WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL 
ACCORDING TO ONE EYEWITNESS 
AFTER DROPPING HIS RIFLE.
NOW IN CUSTODY.
AS WELL.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE JUST HEARD 
FROM THE SHERIFF IS THAT THE 
SHERIFF DIDN'T KNOW YET WHETHER 
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL, VICTOR, HAD 
BEEN CLEARED.
IS THERE STILL ACTIVITY, DO YOU 
STILL SEE STUDENTS COMING OUT OF
THE SCHOOL?
>> Reporter: GEORGE, EVERY 
SINGLE MINUTE WE'RE SEEING MORE 
AND MORE STUDENTS MAKING THEIR 
WAY OUT RIGHT HERE OVER MY RIGHT
SHOULDER, B MAY HAVE BEEN 
STUDENTS AS WELL.
THIS SCENE HERE RIGHT NOW IS 
STILL MASSIVE.
HUGE POLICE PRESENCE.
YOU GOT A LOT OF STUDENTS MAKING
THEIR WAY OUT.
A LOT OF VERY CONCERNED PARENTS.
ALMOST EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, 
PEOPLE ON THEIR CELL PHONES 
DESPERATE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH 
THEIR SONS OR DAUGHTERS.
THE SCENE BEHIND ME, THE SCHOOL,
IT IS JUST ABOUT A FEW BLOCKS 
THAT WAY.
I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE THE 
FLASHING LIGHTS.
THERE ARE STILL HELICOPTERS UP 
HERE IN THE AIR.
THE LATEST NUMBERS FROM THE 
SHERIFF, SCOTT ISRAEL, MULTIPLE 
FATALITIES.
COULDN'T GIVE US AN EXACT NUMBER
ON THAT.
AT LEAST 14 PEOPLE TRANSPORTED 
TO AREA HOSPITALS WITH VARYING 
DEGREES OF INJURIES HERE.
THIS SCHOOL, GEORGE, IT IS 
MASSIVE.
IT IS A HUGE SCHOOL.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR
AUTHORITIES TO GO STEP-BY-STEP 
INTO EVERY SINGLE CLASSROOM TO 
MAKE SURE THE SCENE IS TOTALLY 
SECURE. 
>> THEY'RE GOING THROUGH ROOM BY
ROOM THROUGH THAT SCHOOL, OF 
COURSE THIS UNFOLDED AROUND 2:20
THIS AFTERNOON.
AS WE SAID, WE HAVE BEEN GETTING
REPORTS ALL DAY LONG FROM 
STUDENTS AND PARENTS ON THE 
SCENE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THEIR FRIENDS, 
NEIGHBORS, LOVED ONES, AS WELL 
AS YOU SAID, VICTOR, 14 INJURED 
ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF, 
MULTIPLE FATALITIES.
WE'VE ALSO GOTTEN VIDEO FROM 
INSIDE THE SCHOOL OF THE MOMENTS
WHEN THE SHOOTING UNFOLDED.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> WELL OVER A DOZEN SHOTS THERE
IN ABOUT 10, 15 SECONDS.
JUST A TERRIFYING SCENE INSIDE 
THAT CLASSROOM.
WE SPOKE WITH MATTHEW WALKER WHO
WAS INSIDE THAT CLASSROOM.
WAS SAID SOME OF HIS CLASSMATES 
WERE INJURED.
PERHAPS ONE SERIOUSLY.
BUT THERE WERE NO FATALITIES 
INSIDE THE CLASSROOM.
THE GUNMAN GOING DOOR TO DOOR 
FINDING LOCKED DOORS BUT ABLE TO
SQUEEZE OUT MORE SHOTS THAN ONE 
COULD COUNT ACCORDING TO ANOTHER
EYEWITNESS ON THE SCENE.
MICHAEL.
OF COURSE, FOUR TO SIX MINUTES.
TOM, THE WORK IS BEING DONE TO 
FIND OUT WHAT TRIGGERED THIS 
SHOOTING. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE SEEING A DIFFERENT PATTERN
JUST FROM THE LAST EYEWITNESS 
YOU INTERVIEWED, THAT STUDENT, 
FROM WHAT THE BROWARD SHERIFF 
TOLD US AND A LAW ENFORCEMENT 
SOURCE TOLD ME EARLIER IN THIS 
INVESTIGATION, APPARENTLY THE 
SHOOTER WAS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.
WE KNOW THAT.
HE STARTS FIRING.
AND THEN AT SOME POINT, AND THIS
ACCORDING TO THE THREE PEOPLE I 
JUST MENTIONED, HE SOMEHOW 
BLENDS IN ON THE WAY OUT AS 
PEOPLE ARE EVACUATING AND LATER 
HE'S ARRESTED IN A NEARBY 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
SO HE USED, I GUESS HIS YOUTHFUL
APPEARANCE IN SOME REGARDS TO 
MIX IN WITH THE OTHER STUDENTS.
WE KNOW HE WAS A FORMER STUDENT.
TO TRY TO ESCAPE.
EVENTUALLY WAS COST. 
>> BRAD GARRETT, FORMER FBI 
SPECIAL AGENT, WE TALKED ABOUT 
THIS BEFORE, THIS DOES NOT FIT 
WHAT HAS BEEN THE NORMAL PROFILE
FOR STUHOOTINGS LIKE THIS.
THE STUDENT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO ESCAPE. 
>> THAT'S TRUE, GEORGE.
IT SORT OF TELLS YOU A COUPLE OF
THINGS.
THAT -- I THINK WE HEARD THIS 
EARLIER -- THAT THEIR RESPONSE 
TIME WAS 20, 25 MINUTES.
THE SHOOTING SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS 
FOUR TO SIX MINUTES SO FOR 
WHATEVER REASON, HE CHOSE TO 
LEAVE MAYBE AS SOME STUDENTS 
STARTED TO RUN, BUT IT DOES GO 
TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN HIS HEAD.
HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT WANT TO DIE
THAT DAY AND SAW AN AVENUE TO 
ESCAPE AND TOOK IT.
SO I THINK WE'LL STILL HAVE TO 
FIGURE THIS OUT, BUT THE -- GO 
AHEAD. 
>> ALTHOUGH, BRAD, I THINK -- 
I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE I DON'T 
CONFUSE THIS WITH ANOTHER SCENE.
I THINK THE AURORA SHOOTING, 
THERE WAS A CONCERN THEN, THE 
SHOOTER TRIED TO LEAVE AS WELL.
THAT WAS, PERHAPS, TO PERPETRATE
MOOR VIOLENCE. 
>> WELL, MAYBE, BUT HE COULD 
HAVE SHOT THAT POLICE OFFICER.
YOU KNOW, HOMES COULD HAVE 
EASILY GOTTEN INTO A GUN BATTLE 
WITH THE OFFICERS AT THE BACK 
DOOR OF THAT THEATER WHERE HIS 
CAR WAS PARKED AND HE EXITED AND
CHOSE NOT TO.
AGAIN, WE CAN'T STEREOTYPE THESE
SHOOTERS TOO MUCH AS TO WHAT'S 
GOING ON IN THEIR HEAD, MAYBE 
THE MOTIVATORS MAY BE SIMILAR 
BUT THE END RESULT MAYBE NOT SO 
MUCH.
AGAIN, MOST THE TIME WE SEE THEM
TAKING THEIR LIVES OR FORCING 
THE POLICE TO KILL THEM, BUT HE 
CLEARLY DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT. 
>> MUCH MORE TO LEARN FROM THE 
SCENE.
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THIS 
CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> OH, IT CERTAINLY HAS, GEORGE.
WE KNOW NOW HE'S SPOKEN WITH 
FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR, SPOKENEN 
WITH THE SHERIFF DOWN THERE.
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SUPPOSED TO 
HAVE A BRIEFING WITH PRESS 
SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS OVER AN 
HOUR AGO.
THEY DID CANCEL THAT.
I'M TOLD BY MY COLLEAGUES WHO 
ARE WORKING WITH ME AT THE WHITE
HOUSE THAT REPORTERS WERE 
GATHERED OUTSIDE SARAH SANDERS' 
OFFICE NOT LONG ASK TRYING TO 
ASK HER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEWS
OF DAY BECAUSE THE BRIEFING WAS 
CANCELED.
SHE WENT BACK IN HER OFFICE, 
CLOSED HER DOOR AND SAID WE'RE 
STRICTLY FOCUSED ON THE 
SHOOTING.
THAT'S THE GUIDING FORCE OF 
WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE 
SCENES HERE AT THIS WHITE HOUSE.
WE DID SEE SOME TWEETS FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, OF COURSE, 
EXPRESSING HIS CONDOLENCES AND 
OFFERED ALL THE FEDERAL 
ASSISTANCE THAT FLORIDA MIGHT 
NEED IN THOSE PHONE 
CONVERSATIONS HE HAS HAD HERE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND I ALSO WANT TO BRING YOUR 
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S BEEN 
HAPPENING OVER ON CAPITOL HILL.
WE HAVE SEEN SOME, AND HEARD 
SOME VERY EMOTIONAL REACTION, 
PARTICULARLY FROM THE FLORIDA 
DELEGATION, TOM, NOT THAT LONG 
AGO, MENTIONED THAT TWEET FROM 
FLORIDA, SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, 
AND PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST 
ATTENTION-GRABBING MOMENTS WE'VE
SEEN ON THE CAPITOL IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS IS FROM THE 
CONNECTICUT SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY
WHO IS FROM THE AREA WHERE THE 
SANDY HOOK SHOOTING OCCURRED AND
HE WAS ON THE SENATE FLOOR 
TODAY, GEORGE, HE TOLD AMERICA, 
TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION, AND YOU
WILL SEE CHILDREN RUNNING FOR 
THEIR LIVES.
THIS HAPPENS NOWHERE OTHER THAN 
IN THE UNITED STATES.
THAT IS THE WORD FROM THIS CITY 
RIGHT NOW, GEORGE. 
>> THAT'S THE WORD FROM 
WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW, CECILIA, 
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH SO MANY 
OF THESE SHOOTINGS IN THE PAST, 
DESPITE A LOT OF RHETORIC IN THE
HOURS AND DAYS AFTER THE 
SHOOTINGS, NOT MUCH HAPPENS IN 
THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOW.
>> YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
THIS SO MANY TIMES IN SITUATIONS
JUST LIKE THIS.
FROM THAT SHOOTING THAT TOOK 
PLACE HERE ON THE BASEBALL 
DIAMOND AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
WERE PLAYING AND IN THE DAYS -- 
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF 
THAT, TWEETS FROM MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS AND FROM PRESIDENT, NO 
MATTER THE ADMINISTRATION, 
CALLING FOR AN END TO THESE 
HORRIFIC ACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE 
THEN THE FIGHTS BREAK OUT AND 
THE DEBATES OVER GUN CONTROL 
HAPPEN AND THE DEBATES OVER 
HEALTH CARE, MENTAL HEALTH CARE 
HAPPEN AND IT IS THE SAME DEBATE
THAT WE HAVE HAD FOR YEARS AND 
YEARS AND YEARS NOW AND YET WE 
KEEP SEEING HORRIFIC INCIDENTS 
LIKE THE ONE THAT WE ARE 
WATCHING ON OUR SCREENS AT THIS 
VERY MOMENT AND, GEORGE, I DON'T
KNOW THAT ANYONE IN THIS CITY 
KNOWS WHAT THE SOLUTION IS. 
>> FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE 
COMMISSIONER, THANK YOU, CECILIA
RAY KELLY WITH US.
YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FOR DECADES.
TALK ABOUT HOW THE EVOLUTION OF 
THESE SHOOTINGS OVER YOUR TIME 
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST SCHOOL 
SHOOTING, THE ONE THAT HAD THE 
MOST IMPACT WAS THE COLUMBINE 
SHOOTING IN 1999.
DEVON KLEBOLD AND ERIC HARRIS 
KILLED 13 I THINK AND WOUNDED 
24.
LAW ENFORCEMENT LEARNED A BIG 
LESSON FROM THAT SHOOTING.
THEY HESITATED GOING IN BECAUSE 
THE SORT OF THE TACTIC OF THE 
DAY AT THE TIME WAS TO WAIT FOR 
A SPECIAL TEAM.
A S.W.A.T. TEAM TO GO IN AND 
SEARCH FOR SHOOTERS.
IN THE MEANTIME, PEOPLE WERE 
BEING KILLED, AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT CAME TO THE 
CONCLUSION, HEY, WE CAN'T DO 
THIS ANYMORE.
>> MOVE FAST. 
>> RIGHT, EXACTLY.
SO THAT WAS A SEA CHANGE.
AND YOU SEE THE TRAINING THAT 
TOOK PLACE AFTER THAT, YOU SEE 
THE IMPACT OF THE TRAINING EVEN 
TODAY.
SO IT'S ABOUT LIFE SAFETY, IT'S 
ABOUT MOVING QUICKLY TO THE 
SHOOTING.
WE SAW THAT HAPPEN IN SANDY HOOK
WHERE THE OFFICERS WERE THERE 
FAIRLY QUICKLY AND ENTERED THE 
BUILDING. 
>> FAIRLY QUICKLY, SANDY HOOK, 
26 FATALITIES LATER.
HERE WE ALSO HEARD THAT THE 
POLICE WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN 
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
WE'RE JOINED ON THE PHONE RIGHT 
NOW BY MICHAEL UDINE, BROWARD 
COUNTY COMMISSIONER ON THE 
SCENE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US RIGHT 
NOW.
CONDOLENCES FOR YOU AND YOUR 
COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 
SCHOOL, WHAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR, 
WHETHER THE SCENE HAS BEEN 
CLEARED?
>> THANK YOU, GEORGE.
I KNOW THE SCHOOL VERY WELL.
I'M THE COUNTY COMMISSIONER FOR 
THIS AREA.
I WAS THE MAYOR AND ALL THREE OF
MY CHILDREN WENT TO THIS SCHOOL.
MY DAUGHTER IS A SENIOR IN HIGH 
SCHOOL.
SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE LEFT EARLY 
TODAY SO SHE WASN'T IN THE 
SCHOOL.
MY NIECE WAS IN THE SCHOOL AND 
SHE'S OUT SAFELY ALSO.
THE STUDENTS ARE BEING 
TRANSTRANSPORT
ED OUT OF THE SCHOOL NOW, BEING 
TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOTEL WHERE 
THEY'LL BE REUNITED WITH THEIR 
PARENTS.
AND THE SCENE HERE IS TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
RESPONSE FROM ALL DIFFERENT 
BRANCHES OF, YOU KNOW, STATE AND
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, SHERIFF, 
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SECURE THE
AREA.
THE SHOOTER AND THE ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION HAS BEEN -- 
HAS ENDED AND NOW IT'S A 
QUESTION OF GETTING THE CHILDREN
OUT SAFELY AND REUNITED WITH 
THEIR PARENTS. 
>> COMMISSIONER UDINE, WE HEARD 
AT LEAST 14 INJURED TO LOCAL 
HOSPITALS, MULTIPLE FATALITIES.
DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE INFORMATION 
ON THE NUMBER OF INJURED AND 
DEAD?
>> THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT I 
HAVE AS WELL.
>> AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
THE KIND OF PREPARATIONS THAT 
YOU WENT THROUGH AS A COUNTY FOR
AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS.
>> WELL, THE SHERIFF HAS -- AND 
THE CITY OF CORAL SPRINGS AND 
LOCAL FIRE HAVE ACTIVATED THEIR 
EMERGENCY CREWS, THEIR MOBILE 
COMMAND CENTERS ARE ON SCENE.
THE AREA WAS IMMEDIATELY 
CORDONED OFF.
ALL SUPPORTS, AIR, AROUND THE 
SCHOOL, WAS COMPLETELY HANDLED 
BY THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND 
VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT AND 
POSITIVE RESPONSE BY LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
>> IS THIS SOMETHING YOU TRAINED
FOR?
>> WELL, THEY'RE TRAINING FOR 
IT.
THEY WORK ON THIS AND DO THEIR 
TRAINING TO TRY AND MAKE SURE 
THAT THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS 
ARE HANDLED.
THE CITY OF PARKLAND HAS SCHOOL 
RESOURCE DEPUTIES IN EVERY 
SCHOOL SO THERE WERE DEPUTIES IN
THE SCHOOL TO BEGIN WITH BUT NO 
ONE CAN PREPARE FOR THIS, BUT, 
YOU KNOW, THEY DID THEIR BEST AS
THEY PUSHED THROUGH.
>> COMMISSIONER UDINE, WHAT'S 
YOUR NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY 
RIGHT NOW?
>> PUBLIC SAFETY.
MAKING SURE PARENTS ARE REUNITED
WITH PARENTS.
KEEPING CALM.
THE SHERIFF SAID THERE WILL BE 
VICTIM ADVOCATES IN TOWN TONIGHT
SO STUDENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS, CAN
SPEAK TO THOSE VICTIM ADVOCATES 
AND GET ANY KIND OF HELP THEY 
WOULD NEED IN THIS SITUATION, 
TRAGEDY. 
>> AND RIGHT NOW THE NUMBER-ONE 
JOB IS GETTING ANY REMAINING 
STUDENTS OF THE SCHOOL REUNITING
THEM WITH THEIR FAMILIES. 
>> CORRECT.
CORRECT.
>> COMMISSIONER UDINE, THANKS 
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
WE'RE GLAD YOUR DAUGHTER IS OKAY
AS WELL.
TOM, YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
AREA.
IN SOUTH FLORIDA.
IT'S HIT HARD. 
>> HIT VERY HARD.
HEARD IT IN SENATOR RUBIO'S 
TWEET, BILL NELSON'S VOICE ON 
OUR AIR, HE SAID THERE WERE 
MULTIPLE DEATHS, MULTIPLE 
FATALITIES.
SENATOR RUBIO SAYING THIS IS THE
DAY YOU PRAY THAT NEVER HAPPENS 
AND IT HAS HAPPENED.
ONE THING I'M WONDERING ABOUT 
WHEN YOU MENTIONED THE TWO 
HOSPITALS THESE MULTIPLE VICTIMS
WERE BEING TAKEN TO, ONE OF THE 
HOSPITALS IS VERY CLOSE TO THIS 
SCHOOL BUT THE OTHER HOSPITAL 
YOU MENTIONED IS FAR AWAY.
THIS SORT OF HAPPENED A LITTLE 
BIT EARLIER THAN RUSH HOUR BUT 
THE TRAFFIC CAN ALWAYS BE VERY 
THICK IN SOUTH FLORIDA AND ONE 
THING STRUCK ME THAT THE BROWARD
SHERIFF SAID JUST NOW IN HIS 
NEWS CONFERENCE, HE SAID THERE'S
A VARIETY OF INJURIES IN THE 14 
THAT WERE TAKEN HOW THE 
HOSPITAL, UNCLEAR IF ALL 14 OF 
THE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO MAKE 
IT.
SOMETHING WE'RE MONITORING, 
THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL INSIDE 
THE SCHOOL WHO MAY NEVER COME 
OUT ALIVE AND PEOPLE BEING TAKEN
TO THE HOSPITAL THAT WERE 
UNCLEAR OF THEIR SITUATION.
I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT THE 
SHOOTER, THE ALLEGED GUNMAN, WAS
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AS A 
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURABLY POLICE.
>> MUCH MORE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS
MASS CASUALTY INCIDENT IN SOUTH 
FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON.
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO OUR 
REGULAR PROGRAMMING.
FOR MANY, THIS IS LOCAL NEWS.
THIS HAPPENED AT THE MARJORY 
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN 
BROWARD, FLORIDA.
UNFOLDED AT 2:30.
A SHOOTER, LONE SHOOTER, GOING 
CLASSROOM TO CLASSROOM SHOOTING 
MORE BULLETS THAN COULD BE 
COUNTED ACCORDING TO ONE 
EYEWITNESS.
ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL SHERIFFS,
14 WOUNDED TAKEN TO LOCAL 
HOSPITALS.
MULTIPLE FATALITIES.
THE SHOOTER IN CUSTODY.
AS WE SAID, WE'RE GOING TO 
RETURN NOW TO YOUR REGULAR 
PROGRAMMING.
WE'LL CONTINUE ON ABCNEWS.COM 
AND OF COURSE DAVID MUIR WILL BE
HERE WITH "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" 
AT 6:30 EASTERN.
I'M GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS.
SEE YOU TOMORROW ON "GMA."
>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM ABC NE
