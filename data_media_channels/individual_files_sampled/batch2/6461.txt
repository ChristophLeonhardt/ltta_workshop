I think it's safe to say that growing up a lot of people probably hated their homework from time to time but it was probably pretty rare that your homework was itself hateful and Wisconsin's decided they're gonna go for just that actually so if we could bring up this picture what you're gonna see is something a mother posted this is the homework from a fourth-grade class topic slavery the prompt is give three good reasons for slavery and three bad reasons make notes and then put them into complete sentences on a separate sheet to prepare for presenting an argument if you go to the second one we're gonna see that the lower end of that and so the fourth grader did his job putting out the bad reasons for slavery maybe you can you can add to that list yourself there are several and so the mother was obviously bothered by this that her 4th grader was being asked to explain what a justification for slavery would be and she said this you wouldn't ask someone to list three good reasons for rape or three good reasons for the Holocaust and so she was offended by this and posted the picture Monday evening after seeing her nine-year-old son Jerome struggling with his homework and quote looking really confused she saw he'd already listed bad reasons for slavery such as making them do your chores splitting up families and punishing them he made sure by the way to mention that he is proud to be black and she said to him because he was having problems coming up with the good reason she said just be yourself and so he wrote this is a nine year old I can't think of any good reasons for slavery yeah I was gonna say I hope that you know to try to you know find a like a positive here I hope that mother is also proud of her son Oh for doing that I mean that's really cool that she's like well be yourself and that's what he does he's like you know what this is what I think because you know he's a fourth grader you're not you know you don't really question Authority much when you're that young but uh but this kid did so I think that's awesome he's gonna go on to do something really cool with his life yeah I would think that assignment should be hey what are the three good reasons why elementary school teachers need cultural sensitivity trailer I give it one yeah and so look this is a Wisconsin private school and this is obviously bad even no context just this this is bad they try to explain saying the purpose of the assignment was not in any way to have students argue that slavery's acceptable concept that goes against their core values and beliefs about the Equality and worth of people of all races and if somehow sickly this is like hey we want to teach them critical thinking not not this way I would say not this way but the reason that I care about this and wanted to talk about this today is that even though it seems crazy to me and maybe to you guys too there is a continuing attempt from the right-wing to rewrite the history of slavery not to say that it didn't happen but to imply that we're not being fair in acknowledging all of the positives that these people they lived pretty good lives and they were happy look we have a picture of a people singing and it might seem crazy but you see this all the time people who work at them some of those like recreations of old-timey towns say that people come up and ask them questions well wasn't it nice in some ways like what what did they buy for the slaves and stuff like that and so you just need to know that this is out there in America that this is not a small thing a lot of people do not believe that it was a universal evil one of the greatest stains on a history of our nation I have a good reason for slavery well if there wasn't slavery then black people wouldn't have the have the privilege or the I don't know tend to build the white house right so they were able to build her white house now they could be have the pride of building the white house so if we didn't have slavery black people wouldn't have by the way Bill O'Reilly when he tells that story tells you that the slaves were well fed yeah I've taken care of that's tell ya I had forgotten about that but yes he didn't say that yep he he also said by the way today don't say shithole countries where people can hear you because they will freak out about it that was his tweet now don't say it or don't believe it he said don't say it where people can hear you saying in the shower right before an orgasm like I do so thanks well he's learned a lot since his exile I think don't what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network com less joint
