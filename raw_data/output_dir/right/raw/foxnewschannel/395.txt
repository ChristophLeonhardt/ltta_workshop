1
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:06,764
AINSLEY: AS WE ARE SPEAKING

2
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:07,498
SENATORS ARE NOW IN WASHINGTON

3
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:11,970
REVIEWING THE LATEST FBI REPORT.

4
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,372
ALLEGEDLY NO EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL

5
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:14,973
MISCONDUCT AGAINST JUDGE

6
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:15,340
KAVANAUGH.

7
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:16,674
BRIAN: WE HAVE A NEW TWEET FROM

8
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:17,375
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

9
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:17,709
STATES.

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,344
HE SAID THIS, THE HARSH AND

11
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:20,511
UNFAIR TREATMENT OF JUDGE

12
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:22,080
KAVANAUGH IS HAVING INCREDIBLE

13
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:23,581
UPWARD IMPACT ON VOTERS.

14
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:25,183
THE PEOPLE GET IT FAR BETTER

15
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,317
THAN THE POLITICIANS.

16
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,453
MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS GREAT LIFE

17
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:30,855
CANNOT BE RUINED BY MEAN AND

18
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,891
DESPICABLE DEMOCRATS AND TOTALLY

19
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,226
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS.

20
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:37,562
THE QUESTION IS, DID THE

21
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:38,696
PRESIDENT WRITE THAT AFTER

22
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:39,964
READING FBI REPORT?

23
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:41,999
DID HE PLAY HIS HAND, SAY THERE

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,234
IS NOTHING TO CORROBORATE THE

25
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:43,568
ACCOUNT.

26
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:45,970
AINSLEY: BRINGS UP GOOD POINT,

27
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,805
RUINING A GUY'S LIFE IF THERE IS

28
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,507
NO CORROBORATION, NO EVIDENCE,

29
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,608
HOW FAR DO YOU TAKE THIS?

30
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,343
A MAN WORKED HIS WHOLE LIFE WITH

31
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,045
A STELLAR REPUTATION AND HAS

32
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:55,213
CHILDREN AND A WIFE?

33
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,214
STEVE: SURE.

34
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,616
BRING IN DANA LOESCH, SYNDICATED

35
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:00,351
RADIO TALK SHOW HOST.

36
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,886
DANA EARNS THE SENATE LAST WEEK

37
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:04,155
ASKED THE FBI TO LOOK INTO THE

38
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,489
ALLEGATIONS BY DR. FORD.

39
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,724
THEY HAVE.

40
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:08,159
APPARENTLY PERSONALLY

41
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,694
INTERVIEWED NINE DIFFERENT

42
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,095
PEOPLE.

43
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:12,563
GOT A SWORN STATEMENT FROM A

44
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:12,964
10th.

45
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:15,533
WE DON'T KNOW IDENTITIES OF THE

46
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,101
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.

47
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:18,536
THAT IS WHAT THE SENATE ASKED

48
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,103
FOR.

49
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,206
APPARENTLY THEY CAN PROVE HER

50
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:22,606
ALLEGATIONS.

51
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:23,340
NOW WHAT HAPPENS?

52
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,375
>> OF COURSE THEY CAN'T.

53
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,477
GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL, THESE

54
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,081
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNSUBSTANTIATED

55
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:30,781
ACCUSATIONS.

56
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:31,615
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS INNOCENT AND

57
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:32,783
SHOULD BE CONFIRMED TO THE

58
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:35,453
SUPREME COURT, IF, IF, HEAVEN

59
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,721
FOR BID THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN I

60
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,557
LIKE SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM'S

61
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,991
PROPOSAL TO RENOMINATE HIM AND

62
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:42,793
THEN APPEAL THE SENATE'S VERDICT

63
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,261
TO THE BALLOT BOX.

64
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:46,097
LET THE AMERICAN VOTERS DECIDE

65
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:48,365
HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE SENATE'S

66
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:53,103
TREATMENT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH,

67
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:53,804
PARTICULARLY STATES PRESIDENT

68
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,372
TRUMP HAS DONE VERY WELL,

69
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:56,774
INDIANA, NORTH DAKOTA, MISSOURI.

70
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:58,342
YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER THIS

71
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,511
MORNING ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH

72
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:01,912
EFFECT ON SOME OF THESE VERY

73
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,047
CLOSE RACES.

74
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:06,016
I LIVE IN TEXAS NOW BUT MY HOME

75
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:08,319
STATE MISSOURI SENATOR CLAIRE

76
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,620
McCASKILL IS IN MORE TROUBLE

77
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,722
THAN SHE EVER HAS BEEN AND A NEW

78
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:13,557
POLL SAYING KAVANAUGH HAVING

79
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:14,992
DIRECT EFFECT ON HER NUMBERS.

80
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:16,694
THIS IS HAVING EFFECT ON

81
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:17,594
REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM.

82
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,263
I HOPE REPUBLICANS DO NOT

83
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,596
GAMBLE.

84
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,265
I APPEAL AS A VOTER TO THE

85
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,934
SENATE AND PARTICULARLY TO LISA

86
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,502
MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN COLLINS AND

87
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:27,504
JEFF FLAKE, DO NOT LEGITIMATIZE

88
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,907
A HATEFUL PROCESS FALLING ONE

89
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:33,043
VOTE SHORT AND RUIN THIS MAN'S

90
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:34,011
LIFE AND GOODWILL WITH THE

91
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,212
AMERICAN VOTERS.

92
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:36,880
DO NOT GAMBLE THIS.

93
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,948
CONFIRM THIS INNOCENT MAN.

94
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,883
BRIAN: EIGHT DEMOCRATS ON THE

95
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:40,884
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SENT A

96
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:43,453
LETTER TO REPUBLICAN MEMBERS

97
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,855
YESTERDAY SUGGESTING THAT PAST

98
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,957
FBI INVESTIGATIONS INTO

99
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,658
KAVANAUGH MAY HAVE INCLUDED

100
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,527
INFORMATION ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF

101
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,263
INAPPROPRIATE SEX ALL BEHAVIOR

102
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:54,231
OR ALCOHOL ABUSE.

103
00:02:54,232 --> 00:02:55,532
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

104
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:56,166
>> YEAH.

105
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,468
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IF THAT WAS

106
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,203
THE HIGH SCHOOL ANTICS OR THE

107
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,606
COLLEGE ANTICS, BUT DOESN'T

108
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:03,473
SUBSTANTIATE CLAIMS THAT HAVE

109
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,341
BEEN MADE.

110
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:05,642
DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP MOVING

111
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,543
THESE GOALPOSTS.

112
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:08,445
EITHER HE IS A GANG RAPE

113
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:11,848
CAMPAIGN AND HE SEXUALLY

114
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,049
ASSAULTED ANOTHER WOMAN OR HE

115
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,383
DIDN'T.

116
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:14,985
YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH, AGAIN

117
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,753
MOVING THE GOALPOSTS, WELL, WE

118
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:18,155
DIDN'T LIKE HIS YEARBOOK QUOTE

119
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,956
OR MAYBE HE LIKED BEER WHEN HE

120
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:21,958
WAS IN COLLEGE.

121
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,660
WHAT COLLEGE FRAT BOY DIDN'T BY

122
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,394
THE WAY?

123
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:25,796
I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT IS GREAT

124
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:27,798
BUT I'M SAYING, FOR CRYING OUT

125
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,533
LOUD, IF WE'RE GOING TO SIT HERE

126
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:30,934
AND JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH BY

127
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,102
THESE STANDARDS, I'M TELLING

128
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,270
Y'ALL, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

129
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,205
WASHINGTON, D.C., I HAVE SEEN

130
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,606
BOOZING AT SOME COCKTAIL PARTIES

131
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,308
WHO WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO

132
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:39,876
EVEN CAST A VOTE IN THIS

133
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:40,210
PROCESS.

134
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,745
AINSLEY: MAYBE THEY DIDN'T DO A

135
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,146
DEEP DIVE INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL

136
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:45,015
DRINKING BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

137
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,516
MIGHT NOT WANT A DEEP DIVE INTO

138
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,050
THEIR OPEN LIVES.

139
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,819
>> EXACTLY.

140
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,154
AINSLEY: WE'LL HAVE SENATOR

141
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,056
COONS, CHRIS COONS, DONE A TOUR

142
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:53,790
WITH JEFF FLAKE.

143
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,258
HE HAS BEEN ON SOME OTHER

144
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:56,660
MORNING SHOWS THIS MORNING HE

145
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:57,794
SAYS THIS INVESTIGATION DIDN'T

146
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:58,528
GO FAR ENOUGH.

147
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,330
KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE SEVENTH

148
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:01,464
FBI INVESTIGATION.

149
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:02,365
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATS

150
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,601
ARE GOING TO SAY TO TRY TO STOP

151
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:05,435
THIS NEXT?

152
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:06,502
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS EXPECTING

153
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:07,637
THEY WILL.

154
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,605
>> YEAH.

155
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:10,306
WHATEVER DELAY TACTIC THEY CAN.

156
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:12,475
AT FIRST, REMEMBER WHEN WE ALL

157
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:13,743
GOT STARTED WITH THIS, WE HAVE

158
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:15,578
TO ALLOW THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE.

159
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,613
THE FBI NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE

160
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:16,912
THIS.

161
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:18,147
THEY NEED TO DO ANOTHER

162
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:20,416
BACKGROUND CHECK, A SEVENTH ONE

163
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,553
BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE SEVENTH

164
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,621
ONE WILL FIND WHAT THE PREVIOUS

165
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:25,388
SIX DID NOT.

166
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,390
IT WASN'T TO THEIR LIKING AND

167
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:28,524
CONCLUSIONS DON'T FIT THEIR

168
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:29,525
NARRATIVE AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY

169
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:32,395
WANT TO DELAY, NOW THEY'RE GOING

170
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:34,797
TO SAY THAT THE FBI DIDN'T DO

171
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,232
GOOD ENOUGH JOB AND NARRATIVE

172
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:36,566
CHANGES.

173
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,067
THEY NEED TO PICK ONE, STAY WITH

174
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,169
IT CONSISTENTLY, BECAUSE VOTERS

175
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,471
HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

176
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,472
FBI DID WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED

177
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,006
TO DO.

178
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:45,008
THE SEVENTH BACKGROUND CHECK

179
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,709
DIDN'T UNCOVER ANYTHING TO

180
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,044
SUBSTANTIATE THEIR ALLEGATIONS.

181
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:49,979
THIS SALEM WITCH-HUNT NEEDS TO

182
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,547
BE STOPPED AND HE NEEDS TO BE

183
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:51,914
CONFIRMED.

184
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,016
BRIAN: WE'LL FIND OUT.

185
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,251
WE KNOW DEMOCRATS HAVE A PRESSER

186
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,552
AT 11:00.

187
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:57,520
AT WHICH TIME THEY ALREADY

188
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,788
CONDITION CONCLUDED THEY DON'T

189
00:04:58,789 --> 00:04:59,956
LIKE THE RESULTS.
