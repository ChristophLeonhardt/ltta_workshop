I believe that you need to set measurable goals for people annually and you need to articulate them very clearly and I think that's very important as a boss to do for your team so everyone's running in the same direction and in the right direction but also so that there are measurable goal posts by which to benchmark performance and it becomes a much easier conversation if things aren't working out and you do have to fire someone at least you've had the opportunity to sit with them and give them an ability to improve to have clear expectations that aren't being met so it's not it's less personal and it's less subjective and it's more objective based on what you needed from them from a performance perspective so I always believe in setting very real goals for people and very measurable goals for people and and then helping them try to achieve those
