1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,570
- You have won $125,000

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,379
in the Publishers Clearing House giveaway.

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,212
- Oh.

4
00:00:06,212 --> 00:00:08,070
- [Host] You go right
ahead and shed those tears.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,910
- [Narrator] The Publishers
Clearing House Sweepstakes

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,060
has been around for more than 50 years.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,430
- I never knew there was this
much money in the whole world.

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,670
- [Narrator] Inspiring
generations of dreamers

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,560
with its commercials showing the iconic

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,210
Prize Patrol delivering massive
checks to regular Americans.

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,280
- Honest to God, Marge,

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,850
I am not messing with you.

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,240
- [Narrator] Today, the
company is still thriving,

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,970
bringing in $1 billion in 2017.

15
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,970
So how does Publishers Clearing
House make this much money

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,440
when the company is known
for literally giving it away

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,107
and paying millions
more to settle lawsuits?

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,190
Publishers Clearing House was founded

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,380
by Harold Mertz in 1953.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,120
Back then, the company only
sold magazine subscriptions

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
and it became a pioneer in direct mail.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,830
-This check from the
Publishers Clearing House,

23
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,663
it's mine.

24
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:04,150
- [Narrator] In 1967, it
started its first sweepstakes

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,160
as a way to entice people
to buy more subscriptions.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,450
- [Announcer] January 29th is coming fast.

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,300
That's when Publishers
Clearing House announces

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,660
the winning number for $10 million.

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,110
- [Narrator] By the late 1980s,

30
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,500
Publishers Clearing House
was a household name.

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,870
- I think that they've nailed it

32
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,820
in the way that they approach consumers.

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,410
They show people

34
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,790
that other people feel like,

35
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,070
look just like them.

36
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,310
It could be them.

37
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,524
And they show them getting
this great big huge check

38
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,270
and I think makes other
people kind of think,

39
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,910
well if it happened to them,

40
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,140
it can happen to me.

41
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,170
(crying)

42
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,230
- The emotion and joy that people showcase

43
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,250
when they're surprised and they win

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,010
is really kind of infectious.

45
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,000
- [Announcer] There's only one

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,790
- [Narrator] The marketing campaign worked

48
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,150
thanks to its exciting TV commercials

49
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,010
and signature manila envelopes

50
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,860
that arrived in mailboxes
all over the country.

51
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,193
But by the 90's,

52
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,950
the company faced some trouble.

53
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,190
Numerous states sued the company,

54
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,550
alleging deceptive practices
that made customers

55
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,070
think that the more magazines

56
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,670
and other products they bought

57
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,740
the better their chances
would be of winning

58
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,840
the big money.

59
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,320
- Smart people don't enter those things.

60
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,410
- [Narrator] To be fair,

61
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,370
the company has been clear for years

62
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,790
that no purchase is necessary
to enter the sweepstakes,

63
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,060
but apparently it wasn't clear enough

64
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,360
to the states that filed
lawsuits against the company.

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,200
The trouble came to a head in 1999

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,360
when Congress passed an actual law

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,020
called the Deceptive Mail Prevention

68
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,060
and Enforcement Act to better regulate

69
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,529
Publishers Clearing House
and companies like it.

70
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:39,092
- You've just won our forever prize.

71
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,960
(screaming)

72
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,580
- [Narrator] But that
didn't deter millions

73
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,140
of Americans from coming back

74
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,770
to Publishers Clearing House.

75
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,720
The company currently has approximately

76
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,160
15 million registered users

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,023
and that's largely due to the
company's pivot to digital.

78
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,930
In addition to magazines,

79
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,870
the website has thousands of items

80
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,430
of merchandise for sale.

81
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,950
- They're a really big
digital business now.

82
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,320
They're still a mail order company.

83
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,860
You can sign up and get stuff delivered

84
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,730
to your home left and right,

85
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,940
but they have daily prizes all the time.

86
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,560
You can sign up for these sweepstakes.

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,840
- [Narrator] Another one of
the company's biggest assets

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,480
is its customer's data.

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,790
- They've got a large customer base

90
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,440
that's really willing to give their data.

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,880
They've got people's
names, addresses, ages.

92
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,910
People are very comfortable.

93
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,010
It's very direct and open,

94
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,000
and they're able to target
them with advertising.

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,340
- [Narrator] When you sign up for access

96
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,200
to the Publishers Clearing House website,

97
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,900
it's easy to see why people
would keep coming back.

98
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,450
An endless stream of
opportunities to win cash prizes.

99
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,723
The High Roller Cashout.

100
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,940
The $1 Million Treasure Trove.

101
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,280
The Pinata Payday.

102
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,080
- They refer to it as
gaming as entertainment,

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,300
or shopping as entertainment.

104
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,880
They've really mastered this idea,

105
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,150
it's almost like those
scratch off lotto tickets

106
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,810
you can buy in the drug store.

107
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,820
They've created a digital version of that.

108
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,370
- [Announcer] Welcome to Inside PCH.

109
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,050
- [Narrator] The company
broadcasts live on Facebook.

110
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,883
- Hello, everyone, and--

111
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:55,763
- [Narrator] Where users can tune in

112
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:59,310
and play along live with
even more chances to win.

113
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,256
- So there's nothing to lose

114
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,480
and potentially millions to gain.

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,313
- [Narrator] Even though the company

116
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:05,380
has successfully adapted to digital,

117
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,510
Publishers Clearing House

118
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,970
hasn't completely escaped controversy.

119
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,670
In April of 2018,

120
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,160
a class action lawsuit was
filed against the company

121
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,130
alleging deceptive practices.

122
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,360
In a statement Publishers
Clearing House said

123
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,399
it would vigorously defend and fight

124
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,771
this matter that has no basis.

125
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:22,609
- You recognize us?

126
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,600
- I sure do.

127
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,460
- [Narrator] For years, the
company has settled lawsuit

128
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,020
after lawsuit for tens
of millions of dollars.

129
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,920
- Keep entering, you never know.

130
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,540
- [Narrator] Publishers
Clearing House reveals

131
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,460
the odds of winning its sweepstakes

132
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,870
in the Official Rules
section of its website.

133
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,530
According to Publishers Clearing House,

134
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,877
the odds of winning the company's

135
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:44,980
$1,000 a Day For Life sweepstakes

136
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,100
are one in 6.2 billion.

137
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,520
Compare that to the odds
of winning the highest

138
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,830
Powerball jackpot of all time

139
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,489
at one in 292 million.

140
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,110
- You won $1 million!

141
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,770
(cheering)

142
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,200
- [Narrator] But one thing's for sure,

143
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,500
America is gonna keep playing

144
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,940
because you never know,

145
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,090
it could happen to you.

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,910
We reached out to
Publishers Clearing House

147
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,060
with questions about allegations
of deceptive practices

148
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,730
and how the company protects
its customer's data.

149
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,467
These are the company's responses.
