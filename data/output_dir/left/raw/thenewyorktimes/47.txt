1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:03,100
Strong winds,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,320
deadly storm surges

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,410
and a trail of destruction.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,530
Recent hurricanes have wreaked
havoc in the United States.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,880
And you might be wondering,
how does a hurricane work?

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,160
So, the important thing to
understand about hurricanes

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,470
is that they only
form over warm water.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,570
Think of warm
water as the fuel

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,280
to the engine that
is a hurricane.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,110
A hurricane forms when
warm air over the ocean rises.

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,100
As that warm air rises,
cool air sort of

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,040
fills in below it,

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,140
kind of creating
that cyclonic action.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,040
At the top, it forms clouds,

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,830
and those clouds
create the rain system

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,770
that we associate
with hurricanes.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,110
So, many people are
wondering, is climate change

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,300
making hurricanes worse?

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,040
Yes.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,960
Remember we talked
about how warm water is

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,760
the fuel for a hurricane?

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,320
Because of climate change,
the oceans

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,150
are much warmer than
they used to be.

24
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,550
In recent years, we’ve seen
very powerful hurricanes

25
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,870
like Harvey and Florence.

26
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,329
And the obvious question is,
what do they have in common?

27
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,620
Both of these
hurricanes formed

28
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,300
in unusually warm waters.

29
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,950
Hurricane Harvey
formed in waters

30
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,720
around the Gulf of Mexico
that were,

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,230
on average,

32
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,530
about 1 degree Celsius
warmer than average.

33
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,410
Florence is being
powered by waters

34
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,740
that are 2 degrees Celsius
warmer than average.

35
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,170
So that’s a lot more energy
going into the storm.

36
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,840
The worry with Florence is
not just when it hits land,

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,340
but how long it
will stick around

38
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,729
and how far inland
that will go.

39
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,270
So does this mean
we’re going to have

40
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,590
more storms like this?

41
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,420
The short answer is yes.

42
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,780
The longer answer is storms
like this are even worse.

43
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,640
There’s some talk about
potentially raising

44
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,840
the hurricane category scale
to include a 6 for stronger

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,730
winds than we
currently have.

46
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,890
There is some concern
or some evidence

47
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,217
suggesting that hurricanes
are moving further north.

48
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:46,640
So that means they’re
going to be showing up

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,878
in places that they
haven’t traditionally existed

50
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:51,250
and, potentially,
even in places like Europe.

51
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,550
When there’s a hurricane,
when there’s a wildfire,

52
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,920
climate change
often comes up.

53
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,960
But climate change
is our new reality.

54
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,110
And if we don’t take
steps to mitigate it,

55
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,694
we will continue to see
powerful, severe hurricanes.

56
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,110
And more and more
people are going

57
00:02:08,110 --> 00:00:00,000
to be put in harm’s way.
