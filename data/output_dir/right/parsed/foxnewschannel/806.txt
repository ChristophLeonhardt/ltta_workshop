>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE THIRD TIME
IS THE CHARGE BUT IT'S
INTERESTING.
NORTH KOREA'S LEADING MEETING
WITH THE CHINESE LEADER.
THE LAST TIME THE POW-WOW GOT
THE PRESIDENT CONCERNED.
BUT KIM JONG-UN IS GOING TO BE A
BUSY GLOBAL TRAVELER HERE.
A MAN THAT NEVER LEFT HIS
COUNTRY, SAY UNDER DURESS OR
ORDERS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
CALL IT, WILL BE MEETING WITH
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN THE FALL AND A
HOST OF DIGNITARIES.
HE'S SUDDENLY THE MAN ABOUT TOWN
AND PROBABLY NOT IN THE HERMIT
KINGDOM.
WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THIS,
REBECCA?
>> IT LOOKS LIKE KIM JONG-UN
WANTS A DIFFERENT REPUTATION.
SO HE'S SORT OF MAKING THE
ROUNDS.
THIS MEETING WITH XI IN CHINA IS
INTERESTING.
IT SHOWS THAT NORTH KOREA
UNDERSTANDS HOW CRITICAL THAT
ALLIANCE IS.
CHINA IS REFERRED TO OFTEN AS
NORTH KOREA'S BIG BROTHER.
CHINA HAS TAKEN CREDIT FOR THE
SUCCESS BETWEEN THE SUMMIT WITH
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH
KOREA AND SO, YOU KNOW, LOOKS
LIKE NORTH KOREA IS DEBRIEFING
THE CHINESE AND THE CHINESE ARE
CERTAINLY GIVING THE NORTH
KOREANS SOME ADVICE ABOUT WHAT
TO DO NEXT, VIS A VIS THE UNITED
STATES.
THE NEXT STEP IS THAT THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING MOVES TO
DENUCLEARIZE.
CHINA WILL BE GIVING THEM ADVICE
ABOUT HOW TO GO ABOUT THAT AND
WHAT TO GET OUT OF THE AMERICANS
IN RETURN.
>> Neil: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
THE NORTH KOREAS MIGHT OFFER
THEM ADVICE ON TRADE.
HOW DO YOU LINK THE TWO?
WE'VE GOTTEN TOUGHER WITH THE
CHINESE DESPITE THIS GREAT
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP THE
PRESIDENT TALKS UP BUT EVEN POST
THE MEETING, WE DUG IN OUR HEELS
AND THREATENED THAT EVEN IF THEY
WANT TO RESPOND TO THE NEXT WAVE
OF TARIFFS, WE'RE GOING TO COME
DOWN LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT.
>> IT'S INTERESTING.
SEEMS AS THOUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS STILL GOING HARD ON THE
TARIFFS EVEN THOUGH WE STILL
NEED THE CHINESE TO COOPERATE ON
THE NORTH KOREA ISSUE.
SO -- AND CHINA IS THE ONLY
COUNTRY IN WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS SAID THERE MIGHT BE ANY SORT
OF BENEFIT IN RELAXATION OF
TARIFFS, THAT SORT OF THING, IF
THEY DO HELP IN THESE OTHER
AREAS.
HE'S NOT DONE IT WITH ANY OTHER
COUNTRY.
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
IT'S INTERESTING HOW HARD HE'S
BEING AND RELENTLESS.
YOU HAVE TO WONDER, SOMETHING
HAS TO GIVE.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHINESE
CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON
NORTH KOREA.
THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN GUN TO
RELAX SOME OF THEIR TRADE
RESTRICTIONS LEADING UP TO THE
SUMMIT.
SINCE THEN, THE PRESIDENT SAID
THAT'S OKAY AS LONG ALWAYS THEY
CONTINUE TO HELP THE NORTH KOREA
ISSUE.
A LOT GOING ON THERE.
CLEARLY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL
NEGOTIATING.
WE'RE SEEING THE MIX OF THIS AND
ALL OF IT IS WRAPPED UP
TOGETHER.
>> Neil: I WONDER IF HE READS
THE COMMENTS LIKE JUSTIN TRUDEAU
IN CANADA WHEN HE FELT THAT HE
WAS SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY
THAN WHAT HE SAID AT THE G-7.
THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN DISMISSIVE
OF THE PRESIDENT SAYING THIS IS
RECKLESS, UNWISE.
I WONDER IF THAT STICKS IN HIS
GROIN.
>> IT MIGHT.
THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT THE
TRUDEAU FLAP, TO ME THAT SEEMED
A LOT LIKE MESSAGING TO THE
NORTH KOREANS, WHICH IS THAT
DON'T --
>> Neil: REALLY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE MESSAGE COMING OUT IS DON'T
TRY TO PULL ONE OVER ON
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
YOU HAVE THESE PRIVATE
CONVERSATIONS, YOU MAKE THE
PROMISES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL NOT
GOING TO STICK TO HIS END OF THE
DEAL PUBLICLY IF YOU DON'T STICK
TO YOUR END PUBLICLY.
THAT SEEMS A LOT LIKE MESSAGING
WITH NORTH KOREA.
>> Neil: AND WHAT IF IT'S
JUST -- SOMETIMES WE LOOK FOR A
METHOD OF THE MADNESS AND
SOMETIMES HE'S JUST MAD?
>> COULD BE.
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED
AS AN ANALYST WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT TO BE
OVERLY CONFIDENT BECAUSE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DIFFERENT.
BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT --
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS JUST --
ALMOST ORCHESTRATED TO SOME
DEGREE.
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE
STATEMENTS FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AFTER
THAT.
SO I DO THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT
WE'RE SEEING BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND NORTH KOREA, I STILL
THINK THERE'S NEGOTIATIONS GOING
ON.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL WILLING
TO THROW THE HAMMER DOWN IN THE
COMING MONTHS IF NORTH KOREA
DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE GOOD ON
ITS COMMITMENTS THAT IT MADE
DURING THE SUMMIT.
>> Neil: I'LL MAKE A BET WITH
YOU.
HE'S GOING TO SAY -- SOMEONE
SAYS SOMETHING CHILDISH ABOUT
HIM ON ANY LEVEL, TOMORROW WILL
BE A NIGHTMARE.
THE RESPONSE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER
SEEN.
IT WILL BE BORNE BY SOME SNIPPY
COMMENT.
>> IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THESE
COUNTRIES TO PROBABLY TAKE HIM
SERIOUSLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE
DEFINITELY.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> AND THE OTHER THING, WHAT
WE'RE SEEING WITH CHINA AND THE
NORTH KOREA ISSUE, A LOT OF
THINGS THE CHINESE WILL TELL AND
ADVISE THE NORTH KOREAS TO DO
VIS A VIS THE UNITED STATES ARE
THING THAT THE CHINESE WANT AND
THE NORTH KOREANS WANT.
THEY WANT THE UNITED STATES NOT
TO BE DEPLOYED IN SOUTH KOREA.
THEY WANT THE WAR GAMING
EXERCISES TO STOP, WHICH THEY
ARE ON A PAUSE.
THEY WANT THE MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEMS OUT.
SO THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP
BETWEEN WHAT CHINA AND NORTH
KOREA WANT.
YOU HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.
DOESN'T DO US ANY FAVORS TO SEE
THESE TWO LEADERS MEETING IN
CHINA.
>> Neil: BUT CHINA RIGHT NOW,
THE WAY OTHER PLAYING THIS, NOT
TOO WELL.
THEY'RE ONE STEP AWAY FROM BEING
