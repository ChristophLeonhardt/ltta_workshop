- When you see two guys
holding hands what do you think
is going on?
Your answer will not surprise me
(upbeat music)
look there a lot of reasons
not to hold hands maybe
you have a cold maybe your
palms are sweaty maybe
your fingers are coated
in a slimy layer of Cheeto
dust that you tired licking
off but then turned into an
orange paste stuck under your
nails but then there are a
few totally bogus reasons
that have straightes dudes
freaked out ever where at the
idea of physical contact with
another man so we won't call
it mans-explaining but I have
found the perfect straightes
dude to help explain
hey there Kenny touched any dudes lately?
- So many Franchesca some
how I'm still straight
look showing affection
friendship of familiarity through
touch is perfectly normal
and it's actually instinctive
one of our first impulses as
dumb little babies is to hold
stuff it's so instinctive
there's actually a name for it
it's the Palmer Grasp Reflex
it's a reaction in human babies
and many other mammals prompting
them to grab an object like
a finger in response to its
touch that's right even in a
state where our skulls are
mushy and we're liable to crap
ourselves we still understand
that touch is natural and it
isn't always romantic you
know but at some point middle
school non sexual touch
between men gets stigmatized
and a lot of it comes down
to the absurd social norms we
impose on young men called
toxic masculinity and no toxic
masculinity is not a new energy drink
- But before we go any further
let's just point out that
toxic masculinity doesn't
mean that men are inherently
bad or toxic it's the idea
that the cultural expectation
and restrictions on what
constitute masculinity or a
real man can be extremely damaging
- Toxic masculinity because
holding back your emotions
required energy
well not every man buys into
these cultural expectation
almost every man in this country
has been affected by them
when was the last time you just
went up to your boy and you
were like yo lets hold hands
mother (bleep) and he was like
hell yeah my dude and what's
funny is that our reluctance to
hold hands is because it's gay
or feminine and that assumes
that there is something wrong
with men being gay or feminine
there's not
- The idea that straight men
holding hands is inherently gay
reached a fever pitch not so
long ago during the height of
a boy band you might of
heard of called One Direction
two of the bands members Louie
Tomlinson and Harry Styles
were known for their close
friendship they were frequently
photographed hugging, holding
hands, and even kissing fans
obsessed over their connection
to the point where a rumor
started that the two might
be in a romantic relationship
the thing is despite the
massive amount of shipping fan
faction that I'm sure was
probably written they were not
romantically connected they
both said so so many times
the things is fans wouldn't
let up they even created a name
for the supposedly gay couple
Larry really that's it that is
so basic the band has since
broken up but in 2017 Louie
Tomlinson confirmed that his
friendship with Styles was
changed by fans insistence
that their friendly affection
made them gay he told Seventeen
magazine it created this
atmosphere between the two of
us where everyone was looking
into everything we did. It
made everything a little bit
more unapproachable and I
don't believe I'm going to say
this but how dare you
do that to One Direction
Directioners don't come for me
- What might seem like an
insensitive homophobic joke
that's so gay or you guys
are so gay for each other is
actually an insidious way of
policing masculinity a study
with over 19 thousand
participants at the University of
Indiana showed that men who
adhere to hyper masculine norms
such as the objectification
of women, self reliance, and
repressing emotional expression
typically suffer from mental
health issues and these include
depression, and increased
suicidal thoughts and that
study doesn't even mention the
poor guys that are bullied
for not being hyper masculine
so lets be clear whether you
adhere or not toxic masculinity
helps no one and makes us all
sad and want to kill ourselves
call me a radical but maybe
we should get rid of it
and this fear of holding hands
is also pretty exclusively a
western phenomenon
- Samir Khalaf a sociology
professor in Lebanon told the
New York Times back in 2005
that holding hands is the
warmest expression of affection
between men in Arab culture
it's a sign of solidarity and
kinship the same can be said
for men in Latin American
countries that often greet each
other with a hug or kiss on
the cheek or in India where
men are often seen walking
down the street holding hands
or even in Uganda where men
demonstrating platonic physical
affection is normal despite
being a country with some of the
harshest anti LGBT laws in
the African continent America
land of the free except not
really free for a man to hold
another mans hand
- It's just this guys it's all
it is we're not really asking
you to touch wieners here unless
you want to which of course
is cool besides holding hands
feels good it actually prompts
your body to generate
oxytocin a neural transmitter
associated with feelings of
trust and generosity aka things
that make you happy so if we
know touch is good and strict
masculine social norms are
bad what should us guys do to
change it?
Well here's some stuff start
paying attention to when people
are forcing their own
ideas of gender onto you
reject that watch out for
things like gendered colors,
gendered toys, gendered sports,
gendered careers, because
all these things do is create
very narrow spaces for people
to explore and be themselves
- In other words pink is just
a color if you think it looks
good on you go for it
and this kind of thinking is
extra important if you're a
parent but if all of this sounds
like a lot of work there is
one little thing you can
do the smallest of gestures
- Find another guys and
hold his (bleep) hand
it'll probably be weird at
first okay but I promise
if you're attracted to women
holding another dudes hand
is not going to change that
and after you get over breaking
a social taboo it'll actually
feel nice it might even make
healthier and if that's too
much I get it you might want to
build up to it alright maybe
start out with one of those bro
dude arm around the shoulder
things you know maybe try
giving your bro a hug without
having to slap the feminine
energy out of him so hard that
you leave marks on his back
maybe even just give a fist
pound if you're a started and
just hold it there for a
minute let your knuckles really
absorb each others oxytocin
what ever you gotta do alright
back to you Franchesca
- Thanks Kenny now that we've
squashed some homophobic
ideas about intimacy and
shown just how much toxic
masculinity can deprive us
of literally life saving
interactions the rest is up
to you finding little ways to
affirm and support each other
doesn't make a guy any less
manly but it could make you
and the people you love a lot
happier thanks for watching
and thanks again to Kenny
Deforst and we'll see you next
time right here on Decoded.
