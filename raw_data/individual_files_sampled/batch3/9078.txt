PANEL, THANK YOU. I WANT TO TURN NOW TO THE FOCUS ON THE NEXT MAN WHO COULD BECOME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE, THAT'S CALIFORNIA ADAM SCHIFF. SEAN DUFFY REFERENCED HIM. IF HE BECOMES CHAIRMAN, HE'S VOWED TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE RUSSIAN COLLUSION THAT SO FAR NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVE. I'M JOINED BY FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ANDY McCARTHY. IF SCHIFF TAKES CONTROL OF THE HOUSE INTEL, WHAT MIGHT WE EXPECT SPECIFICALLY? I ANY WE EXPECT EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD I THINK WE EXPECT EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD FROM YOUR LAST PANELIST, UNTIL MICHELLE CALLED HER OUT ON IT, WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET IS, YOU KNOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING, LOOK AT THE FINANCING BEHIND TRUMP'S BUSINESS EMPIRE, LET'S IN PARTICULAR LOOK AT THE FINANCING OF HIS REAL ESTATE ASPECT OF HIS BUSINESS. OF COURSE THEY'LL SAY THEY NEED THE TAX RETURNS FOR THAT. AND WE WILL BE OFF TO THE RACES. THAT'S WHAT IT WILL BE FOR HOWEVER LONG IT LASTS. ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE OF GREAT BENEFIT POLITICALLY TO THE PRESIDENT. BUT I DON'T THINK THE COUNTRY WILL LIKE IT. Laura: THEY'LL ALWAYS OVERREACH, TRY TO TANGLE EVERYTHING UP, AND TANGENTIAL ISSUES THAT WILL NOT HELP A SINGLE AMERICAN, HAVE A BE JO, HOLD A BE JO, AND RAISE WAGES. NONE OF THAT IS GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT'S PAV LOEFIAN WHERE THE DEMOCRATS SAY, LIKE THEY'RE AT THE GATES AND THEY JUST WANT TO RUSH THE GATES AND GET THE STUFF DONE. ANDY, I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT A REPORT THAT CAME OUT JUST A FEW HOURS AGO, JOHN SOLOMON'S PIECE IN "THE HILL" ABOUT FBI OFFICIALS AND DOJ OFFICIALS WHO HAD BEEN GETTING FREEBIE TRIPS TO VARIOUS FOREIGN DESTINATIONS. AND ONE OF THE CHIEF BENEFICIARIES OF THESE FOREIGN TRIPS, FREEBIE TRIPS, WAS ANDREW WEISSMANN. OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR PEOPLE IN THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. WHAT'S GOING THERE? YEAH, THIS HAS BECOME A REALLY BIG PROBLEM, LAURA. I WROTE ABOUT IT A FEW MONTHS BACK WHEN IT CAME UP IN THE FINANCIAL FRAUD INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK. THIS WHOLE IDEA OF THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAVING THIS KIND OF INSAYS TO YOUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA, TRADING INFORMATION, AND THEY'RE GETTING FAVORS OUT OF THIS, THEY'RE GETTING TICKETS TO SPORTS EVENTS, THEY'RE GETTING ALL KINDS OF BENEFITS OUT OF IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. OUGHT TO BE ITEM ONE THEY'RE
