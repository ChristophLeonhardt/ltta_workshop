Wow.
The front door is locked,
but you can walk in there.
You could just-- can't you
reach in and unlock it?
 walk
right in there.
Wow.
Why don't you just
open the door for me?
 Why do we both
have to crawl through?
We're gonna have to open up
the windows and air it out.
There's no electricity for
fans, but looks like the water
stopped here.
I'm glad we move
this, 
Yeah, I think about my mom.
She loved it here.
She loved this place.
But we'll fix it up.
That's what we kept
it going, really--
out of respect for our folks.
