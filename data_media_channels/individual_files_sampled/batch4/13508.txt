I told you we would get back to the ar-15 we're back at the ar-15 the ar-15 is all over the news it is constantly pushed on the news it's pushed as the worst weapon in the entire world by gun control advocates they say we just have to get rid of the ar-15 you hear this at rallies people are talking about this all the time I think the reason they do this is because the ar-15 is scary-looking and what they say is the ar-15 is an assault rifle we don't need assault rifles the air 15 is an assault rifle the trouble with this is that the ar-15 is not an assault rifle the people I think they are able to convince people that it's an assault rifle because it has AR and people think that stands for assault rifle it doesn't stand for assault rifle a R stands for Armalite rifle that's the name of the company that manufactured the ar-15 so it doesn't mean an assault rifle when people are talking about an assault rifle they're talking about a gun that's fully automatic you pull the trigger once and a spray of bullets comes out and like a machine gun and I think maybe it would be a good idea to limit the exposure to those kind of guns good thing is we did ban those guns 84 years ago machine guns have broadly been banned for public use for 84 years good thing control advocates can be very happy about that but the ar-15 is not an assault rifle it's not a machine gun you don't just pull the trigger once and a spray of bullets comes out the ar-15 is in many ways just like a regular hunting rifle you have the gun you pull the trigger once one bullet comes out you can take it a hunting rifle same thing I the mainstream media and gun control activists they focus on the ar-15 because it's scary also because it has been used in very public incidents very widely reported shooting incidents in recent times and I think finally because the ar-15 is so popular it's one of the most popular guns in America and so gun control advocates say if we can ban the ar-15 we'll take a huge dent out of the gun market in America but the ar-15 is actually used in relatively few shootings each year so it doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you want to reduce the prevalence of guns in the country or the prevalence of crimes involving guns it doesn't really make sense to ban the ar-15 in fact according to FBI data from 2011 the number of people who were killed that year and each year from rifles of any kind not just the ar-15 but the ar-15 hunting rifles different caliber rifles all of those people are 323 a relatively small number of people killed each year to put that in context five times as many people are killed each year using knives so are we going to have knife control are we going to start instituting assault knife bans no more knives the federal government's going to storm into your kitchen take your butter knives because statistically that's much much more dangerous than an ar-15
