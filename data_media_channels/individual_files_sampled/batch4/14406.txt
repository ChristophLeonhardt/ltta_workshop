the new Democratic governor of New Jersey is literally welcoming illegal aliens including ms-13 gang members into his state in creating an agency who protect them yeah you heard me right incoming Democratic governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy who was by the way Barack Obama's ambassador to Germany a guy who I'm sure conspired with Angela Merkel to infest Germany with Muslim raping migrants is now hell-bent on changing the complexion of the state of New Jersey which was already blue and putting its residents at risk as far as I'm concerned he is creating a defensive Protection Agency or illegal aliens it is it is absolutely mind-blowing let me read you a couple of his tweets Murphy tweeted honored to be sworn in as the new governor of this great state in just a few short days together we will build a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all bearer not a more law-abiding New Jersey not a safer for families New Jersey not a safer for women New Jersey not a New Jersey that respects the rule of law not a New Jersey that respects success legal behavior and hard work not a New Jersey that wants to promote business ownership no in New Jersey that exists to protect illegal aliens in fact in a debate between Murphy and and then lieutenant governor kim kim Guadagno who was running against him for governor Murphy said dreamers are every reason to dreamers are every bit as American as my four kids well that's not true cuz I'm gonna bring you some data on the show later this week but I'll give you a snippet of it now a very recent data from September 2017 from Department of Homeland Security's US Citizenship and Immigration Services tell us that the median age of a dreamer is twenty three point eight years old twenty four years old in fact only 2000 think about this only 2,000 of the 800,000 dreamers in the United States are under 16 years old the vast majority are 20 and older and even the greatest majority is 25 and older 24 and older mind blowing mind blowing this is a guy who wants to protect them now let me read you a couple of more things that he said with regards to creating this agency let's create an agency that illegals can call quote call with questions about their status he goes on to say quote the rumors that swirl around communities are extraordinary and it's literally hard to get particularly if you're on that particularly if you're undocumented the right answer to your question that's when people go back into the shadows because they're illegal they shouldn't be getting taxpayer funded a legal aid advice and don't kid yourself this agency will morph into legal aid attorneys coming over and telling these people how to thwart law enforcement efforts to deport them that's what this will ultimately be all about he added now this was my favorite this one really got me going he added he thought the term sanctuary had become a political buzzword he prefers the term welcoming he wants to welcome in the illegal so let me read you one of his tweets and tell you was that really mean well as a tweet from Phil Murphy incoming governor of New Jersey former ambassador to Germany under the rock under Barack Obama Salvadorian immigrants came to New Jersey in the u.s. seeking refuge they've become our friends neighbors and colleagues ending TPS temporary protected status for Salvadorians will tear apart families they report and do nothing to make our communities safer now what does that miss 13 stand for again anyone anyone anyone Mara Salvatrucha Salva trucha Salvadoran gangs ms-13 from El Salvador former Salvatore and militaries who founded ms-13 they were escorting cartel drug shipments Mexican and Colombian cartel drug shipments up to the u.s. they were the enforcers and they've trained future generations to be just as brutal even more brutal this is so he's protecting not just protecting welcoming them welcoming them so now it's so longer it's a sanctuary no longer about protecting them no longer about having local cops when they stopped them for speeding or DWI in that report their immigration status the ice but that was what a sanctuary would be now they're being welcomed and this illustrates very nicely just how far left just how far left the Democratic Party has gone I often say on the show you hear me say it there is no ideological Center but when the right and the left need to come to a table Republicans are always ostracized for being obstructionist but they're not coming here they're not coming here the left wants us to come over here they want us to be socialists and radicals and communism we don't want to be so we have nothing to talk to them about their Center is an hour center their center isn't the center of a majority of law-abiding Americans and now the state of New Jersey is taking it a step further they're saying we don't care if you're illegal we don't care if you broke federal law welcome to New Jersey come on in come on in pillage our social services take our entitlements rape the women run your gang activity turn young girls out of the prostitution deal drugs murder maim assault kill steal their vehicles drive drunk kill Americans we don't care I'm Phil Murphy the new governor of New Jersey I welcome you here now you can see why it's got me fired up this is disgraceful but in a way I like it it's like I said it shows Americans it highlights it illustrates for Americans it illuminates just how radical today's Democratic Party is and I didn't know much about Phil Murphy until I started digging into this story but I can tell you one thing from what I've seen this guy is some of the worst of the worst the Democratic Party has to offer please subscribe to our premium service at www.mediaed.org this you
