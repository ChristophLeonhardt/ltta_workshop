tongue-in-cheek way and that she's
playing with it but it's not you're like
yeah maybe I mean I'd love to have
someone pay for me and like just Joe but
I think it's unrealistic

singing like a traitor - no blues he
sounds like Paul McCartney in that red
most powerful pulse strewed

with fake IDs and they would have like
foolin parties and there you women the
fubar the night so it's quite old school

skateboarder music gonna be really fun
