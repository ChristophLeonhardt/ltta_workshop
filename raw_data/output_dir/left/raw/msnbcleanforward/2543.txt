BECAUSE OF THE TRADE WAR DONALD TRUMP HAS PRECIPITATED BECAUSE

44
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,222
TRUMP HAS PRECIPITATED BECAUSE WHEN THE MARKETS DISSIPATE, WHEN

SOYBEANS FROM BRAZIL, FOR EXAMPLE.

49
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,896
EXAMPLE. BUT YOU LOOK AT HIS UNDERMINING

50
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:51,335
BUT YOU LOOK AT HIS UNDERMINING OF THE U.S.-LED LIBERAL GLOBAL

51
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:51,635
OF THE U.S.-LED LIBERAL GLOBAL ORDER.

52
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,539
ORDER. HIS SUNDAYERING OF THE ATLANTIC

00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,140
HIS SUNDAYERING OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE.

HIS ZERO SUM BELIEF THAT MIGHT MAKES RIGHT.

56
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:02,279
MAKES RIGHT. I THINK THERE’S A REAL LACK OF

57
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,648
I THINK THERE’S A REAL LACK OF IMAGINATION FOR THE CAPACITY FOR

58
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,216
IMAGINATION FOR THE CAPACITY FOR TRAGEDY IN THE WORLD CAUSED BY
