feminists have decreed that March 8th will be a day without a woman so ladies if you're planning to join this important event please remember to stock the refrigerator with sandwiches before you go so we'll have something to eat otherwise I know all us men will be dreading the moment women go on strike for the day and wondering how on earth we're going to store up enough whiskey and cigars to get through an entire Jason Statham Film Festival but you know if women are going off on their own for the day it only seems fair that they should leave behind not just men but also all the things that men have given them over the years after all if you want us to learn how difficult it would be for men to get along without women then you should also have to learn how difficult it would be for women to get along without men so on day without a woman day how about women don't get to use anything that was invented or discovered by a man that would include democracy cars computers aspirin electricity telephones light bulbs tools television the piano the internal combustion engine antibiotics the internet paved roads lawnmowers books clocks thermometers the Sistine Chapel Shakespeare's plays soda trains vaccines paper steel airplanes the constitution elevators recorded music pasteurized milk the ballpoint pen radios zippers nylon cameras movies synthetic material email and pretty much everything else except for alphabet blocks windshield wipers and radio activity though you might not want to use all three of those at the same time also while you're out there protesting how poorly men have treated you you might want to make some exceptions say for those men who have defended your country's patrolled your streets built your houses cities and highways pulled you out of burning buildings treated your diseases supported your children and faithfully loved you because really when you think about it if men don't love women who do you think will then there's the question of priorities feminists in the West are dealing with such Titanic issues as the fact that information bots like Siri and Alexa have female voices this is a problem because these bots are helpful and knowledgeable which makes them unfeminist since feminists have never helped anyone and don't know anything otherwise they wouldn't be worried about crap like this feminists are also complaining that Siri and Alexa don't protest when you sexually harass them although any guy who gets his kicks by sexually harassing a little plastic box he's so pitiful you might want to cut him some slack on the other hand feminists never seem to protest that women in Muslim countries are routinely flogged stoned and imprisoned for expressing their humanity so you can understand why this might cause some observers to believe that this day without a woman might actually turn out to be a day without a spoiled whiny entitled feminist girl child in an absurd hat making a fool of herself over nothing in fact I actually said as much to Alexa but she slapped me trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show
