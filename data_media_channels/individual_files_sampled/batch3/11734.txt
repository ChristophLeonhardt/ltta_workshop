fireworks may have been a must for Independence Day but for a number of patriotic citizens who suffer from PTSD it's the part they dread the most if somebody hears those loud and unexpected noises that could send them into instead of flight-or-fight when it's in your own house and it's happening next door or in your front yard or street you can't prepare for that for many vets marijuana is the most effective way of relieving PTSD symptoms this past Sunday libertarians held what they called a march of the Dead veterans claiming the war on drugs is preventing some veterans from seeking treatment freely and they say it's led to a number of suicides we have 20 veterans committing suicide every single day in this country and especially when Democrats and Republicans in power don't seem to care about this it's all the more important that we call attention to this issue and support those who are doing something about it some veterans are fed up waiting for change nearly a week ago a US Air Force veteran wearing a vest lined with flammable devices set himself on fire to protest the treatment of veterans like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA who did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development 40,000 veterans are homeless on any given night and the Department of Justice estimates that military veterans account for 8 percent of the national prison population one of the media things the US government needs to do is to stop sending young men and women to go fight immoral illegal and illegitimate wars and then when veterans are coming back there should be tens of billions of dollars spent on trying to take care of those veterans I think people generally want to do good things for veterans 99 percent of people have absolutely no clue about what's going on over season to be honest with you we can't blame the American people for that I largely blame the corporate media in the United States who has done a great job of shielding US citizens from what's happening abroad if the US government was genuinely interested in preventing veteran suicides the US government would stop creating so many US Aran's you
