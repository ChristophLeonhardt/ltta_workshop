1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,320
Aung San Suu Kyi was one of the world’s
most famous political prisoners.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,540
Now she is a beloved politician in Myanmar.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,280
She helped the country restore democracy...

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,910
After 62 years of British colonial rule…

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,929
3 years of Japanese occupation...

6
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:21,490
And another 50 years under the rule of an
oppressive military junta.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,390
And she did it while being locked in her home.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,519
This is how a political prisoner won the esteem
of the international community, got elected

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,400
leader of her country, and is now at risk
of losing the respect of the world.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,160
Aung San Suu Kyi was born in 1945 in Rangoon,
now Yangon, to Buddhist, Bamar parents, Myanmar’s

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,780
dominant ethnic group that makes up nearly
70 percent of the population.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,690
Her father, Aung San, was a general who led
the push to end British colonial rule.

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,620
In 1947, during an executive council meeting
to discuss the transition to independence

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,239
a group of gunmen burst in and opened fire.

15
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,199
No one knows exactly who sent these gunmen,
but they shot dead, seven or eight people.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,180
One of them was Aung San, Suu Kyi's father.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,570
She was only two years old at the time.

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,320
That’s Bloomberg Editor Jason Koutsoukis.

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,290
I’m the Southeast Asia Government Editor
for Bloomberg News.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,340
After the death of her father, the country
completed the transition to become a democratic

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,820
republic, with the official name Union of
Burma.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,869
When she was 15, Suu Kyi moved to New Delhi
after her mother was appointed ambassador

23
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:25,940
to India.

24
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,310
After finishing high school, she went to Oxford
University, where she studied philosophy,

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,920
politics and economics.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,000
She graduated in 1968 and moved to New York
City, where she worked at the United Nations.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,380
In 1972 she married British academic Michael
Aris, they had two sons, later returning to England.

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,340
One of the conditions Aung San Suu Kyi had
set at the start of the marriage was, if ever

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,680
she felt that her country needed her, she
would go back.

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,340
In 1988 Suu Kyi did return to Burma after
her mother suffered a stroke.

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,969
While there she became involved with the student
protest movement that was rising up against

32
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:04,960
the military regime.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,000
What we want the military
to do… is keep out of politics.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,500
We don’t want the military to split up.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,630
We want the armed forces to keep together
but keep out of politics.

36
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,670
This movement was building and you could see
which way the wind was blowing.

37
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,410
It wasn't just luck.

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,960
She didn't just happen to be there.

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,920
This was definitely something that she always
felt deeply about.

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,470
The liberation leader’s daughter tapped
her father’s contacts and formed a political

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,220
party - the National League for Democracy.

42
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,470
Soon afterwards she was elected its secretary
general.

43
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,660
Seen as a threat to the junta, Suu Kyi was
put under house arrest.

44
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,940
And there she stayed for almost 15 of the
next 21 years.

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,950
Her husband died in 1999.

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,380
while she was locked up.

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,920
She received the international media when
she was under house arrest and she was very

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,980
successful in creating a brand, She is one
of those real stand out figures from the 1980s

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,650
and 1990s who won a Nobel Peace Prize.

50
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,170
Propelled by international pressure, the government
finally released Suu Kyi on November 13, 2010.

51
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,840
Five years later the NLD swept to power in
elections and she finally took charge of the

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
country.

53
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,720
Constitutionally barred from becoming president
for being the mother of foreigners - a provision

54
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,170
apparently inserted by the military
specifically targeting her - Suu Kyi instead

55
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,420
took the title of State Counselor.

56
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,870
I think it's probably no longer applicable
to say she's the de facto leader of Myanmar

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,340
because in practice she really is the leader of the
country.

58
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,120
Her popularity and authority has not been
questioned.

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,730
Until now.

60
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,330
The Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 while
under house arrest was “for her non-violent

61
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,900
struggle for democracy and human rights."

62
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,340
Although the scope of her control over the
military is unclear, she is facing calls from

63
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,190
petitioners to be stripped of the award for
not doing enough to stop the military repression

64
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,690
and forced exodus of the Rohingya, a Muslim
minority living near the Bangladesh border.

65
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,040
More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled into
Bangladesh since August.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,100
The United Nations has called it ethnic cleansing,
while Suu Kyi and the military say they are

67
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,730
seeking to root out terrorists.

68
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,120
I think there is a sense of bewilderment among most people

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,940
in Myanmar at the response to the Rohingya crisis.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,140
They see the Rohingya as people who don't
belong in their country.

71
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,480
They just cannot understand

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,410
why Myanmar is being criticized so harshly
overseas.

73
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,830
Suu Kyi is resisting growing international
pressure to denounce the alleged human rights

74
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,880
abuses being committed against the Rohingya.

75
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,720
Instead, she’s showing a more ruthless determination
to hang onto power no matter what cost to

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,990
her international reputation.

77
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,090
The government has been making every effort
to restore peace and stability and to promote

78
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,200
harmony between the Muslim and Rakhine communities.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,980
She's come down decisively in favor of majority
public opinion on this issue.

80
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,640
That's one of the reasons she has
remained so popular at home throughout this crisis.

81
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,980
The same global audience that transformed
her into a political star is now demanding

82
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,630
she take a stand.

83
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,650
This security council and the United Stations
to take strong and stiff action to bring this

84
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,110
crisis to an end.

85
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,370
Whether she can stem the tide of international
condemnation and once again become a symbol

86
00:05:17,370 --> 00:00:00,000
of human rights remains to be seen.
