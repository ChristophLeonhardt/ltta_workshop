59
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,438
BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE 

60
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,342
SHOULD NOT ASK FOR THE RECORD 

61
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,075

62
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,078

>>  IF I MAY. 

74
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,341
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THESE 

75
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,442
TEXTS REPRESENT PERSONAL 

76
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,244
BELIEFS JUST LIKE THOSE THAT 

77
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,278
YOU FIND ON MY PERSONAL PHONE. 

78
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:27,747
WHAT THEY DO NOT REPRESENT IS 

79
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,782
ANY ACT, ANY SUGGESTION OF AN 

80
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:29,982
ACT. 

81
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,884
ANY CONSIDERATION THAT WE NEED 

82
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:34,187
TO DO THIS OR NOT DO THIS AND 

83
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,089
FURTHER MORE I WOULD ENCOURAGE 

84
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,157
YOU AS I BELIEVE I FORGET WHO I 

85
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,592
SAID THIS TO EARLIER THIS 

86
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:39,859

87
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,893
YOU NEED TO READ THESE TEXTS IN 

88
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,462
THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WAS GOING

00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,364
ON AT THE TIME. 

90
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,999
SO WHEN I MAKE THE COMMENT 

91
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,667
ABOUT TRUMP HAVING NO IDEA HOW 

92
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,067
DESTABILIZING HIS 

93
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,068
ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE, THAT 

94
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,371
CAME ON THE HEELS OF A SPEECH 

95
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,572
WHERE THEN CANDIDATE TRUMP SAID 

96
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,540
THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR 

97
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,776
NOT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD 

98
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,345
HONOR ITS COMMITMENT TO MUTUAL 

99
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,246
DEFENSE UNDER NATO. 

100
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,417
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT. 

101
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:04,950
MR. CHAIRMAN. 

102
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,420
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

103
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,753
MR. CHAIRMAN. 

104
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:08,521
IN LIGHT OF THESE. 

105
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:08,888
NO. 

106
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:09,054
NO. 

107
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:09,388
[INAUDIBLE]. 

108
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:11,124

00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:11,524
ANSWER. 

110
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,124
>>  EVERYBODY WILL SUSPEND. 

111
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:13,092
I TOLD HIM THEY COULD ANSWER 

112
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,494
BRIEFLY AND HE D. 

113
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,962
>>  HE HASN'T FINISHED. 

114
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:22,067
>>  WE WILL NOW TURN TO THE 

115
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,370

116
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:24,971

120
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,048

00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:42,522
YOU ARE A SENIOR -- WERE A 

122

SENIOR AND EXPERIENCED FBI 

123
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,224
STAFF PERSON IS THAT NOT RIGHT? 

124
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,093
>>  I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF A 

125
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,095
SENIOR AND EXPERIENCED FBI 

126
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:49,929
STAFF PERSON, YES. 

127
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:55,068
>>  NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 

128
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,871
IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE 

129
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,975
LAST ELECTION INVOLVING HILLARY 

130
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,644
CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP AT THE 

131
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,879
HIGHEST LEVEL, IS THAT NOT THE 

132
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,347
CASE? 

133
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,315
>>  IF YOU MEAN BY HIGHEST 

134
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,883
LEVEL THAT I HAD INTERACTIONS 

135
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,118
WITH THOSE CASES WITH THE 

136
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,386
DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR 

137
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,187
AND SENIOR STAFF OF THE 

138
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,988
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YES. 

139
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:19,091
>>  THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. 

140
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:24,297
NOW, WE HAVE BEEN READING FROM 

141
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,800
YOUR PERSONAL PHONE AND YOUR -- 

142
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,003
AND YOUR OFFICIAL PHONE. 

143
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:35,975
DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT YOUR 

144
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,077
PERSONAL POLITICAL MESSAGES -- 

145
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:45,017
IF THEY BECAME PUBLIC MIGHT BE 

146
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,185
MISUNDERSTOOD IN LIGHT OF YOUR 

147
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:46,418
ROLE? 

148
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,388
>>  I DIDN'T BECAUSE I NEVER 

149
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,622
THOUGHT THEY WOULD BECOME 

150
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:49,856
PUBLIC. 

151
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,824
>>  EVEN THOUGH THEY -- SOME OF 

152
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,795
THEM WERE NOT ON YOUR PERSONAL 

153
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,129
PHONE. 

154
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,462
>>  CORRECT. 

155
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:56,896
I'M -- YES. 

156
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,263
THAT'S CORRECT. 

157
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,832
>>  SO THAT MEANS ANYTHING 

158
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,769
THAT'S ON YOUR OFFICIAL PHONE 

159
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:07,106
OF COURSE BELONGS TO THE 

160
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,107
PUBLIC. 

161
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,209
SO, I JUST WANT TO ESTABLISH 

162
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,577
THAT THIS -- THIS CONFUSION 

163
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,980
BETWEEN YOUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 

164
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,550
PHONE IS PART OF OUR PROBLEM 

165
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,051
HERE TODAY. 

166
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,020
NOW, AS WE HOLD THIS HEARING I 

167
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,624
WANT TO NOTE FOR THE RECORD 

168
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,226
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON HIS 

169
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:32,265
WAY TO A VERY CONTROVERSIAL 

170
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,000
MEETING WITH PUTIN. 

171
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,575
LET ME ASK YOU SIR, ABOUT A

USUALLY SPEAK IN SUCH ABSOLUTE 

177
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,724
TERMS SO HEAR THEM. 

178
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:03,029
WE ASSESS RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 

179

00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,954
CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR PRESIDENT 

189
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:28,287
ELECT TRUMP. 

190
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,691
WE HAVE A HIGH CONFIDENCE IN 

191
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,092
THESE JUDGEMENTS. 

192
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,426
ARE THESE CONCLUSIONS FAMILIAR 

193
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:34,727
TO YOU? 

194
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,963
>>  THEY ARE. 

195
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:43,369
>>  ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY 

196
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,704
FINDING THAT UNDERMINES THESE 

197
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,772
CONCLUSIONS OF THE THREE 

198
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:47,305
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES? 

199
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:50,309
>>  I AM NOT. 

200
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,312
>>  THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE 

201
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,749
OTHER SIDE OF THE CAPITOL UNDER 

202
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:05,825
THE LEADERSHIP OF A REPUBLICAN 

203
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,092
CHAIRMAN. 

204
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:12,331
RICHARD BURRR HAS MADE A 

205
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,266
BIPARTISAN FINDING AFFIRMING 

206
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,769
THE ASSESSMENTS AND I WANT TO 

207
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,640
QUOTE JUST BRIEFLY FROM THEM 

208
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,909
THAT THE THREE COMMITTEES -- 

209
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,144
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMISSION 

210
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,547
ASSESS MEMBER IS A SOUND 

211
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,048
INTELLIGENCE PRODUCT. 

212
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,349
NOW, LET ME -- INDICATE 

213
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,653
SOMETHING THAT I HAD NOT KNOWN 

214
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,589
BEFORE PREPARING FOR THIS 

215
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,356
HEARING. 

216
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,559
THEY NOT ONLY CITED THE USUAL 

217
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,495
CONTEXT HERE IN THE UNITED 

218
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:48,467
STATES, THEY QUOTED PUBLIC 

219
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,269
RUSSIAN LEADER MONTEREY, MEDIA 

220
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:57,577
REPORTS, ALL LINE WITH THE BODY 

221
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,346
OF OUR INTELLIGENCE REPORTING. 

222
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,313
WERE YOU AWARE OF THE 

223
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,982
CONFLUENCE OF WHAT THE RUSSIANS 

224
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,285
WERE SAYING AND WHAT OUR OWN 

225
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,187
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES ARE 

226
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:08,554
SAYING? 

227
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,889
>>  I BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND YOUR 

228
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,891
QUESTION TO BE BETWEEN THE 

229
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,159
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SOURCES 

230
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,460
AND METHODS AND OPEN SOURCE 

231
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,861
REPORTING, YES I WAS AWARE OF 

232
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,129
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT COMING 

233
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,364
TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME. 

234
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,301
>>  DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO 

235
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,669
BELIEVE THAT THE SENATE 

236
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,338
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE OR THE 

237
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,742
NSA OR THE CIA OR THE FBI OR 

238
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,812
THE OFFICE OF THE DIVISION OF 

239
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,381
INTELLIGENCE ARE ON SOME KIND 

240
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,582
OF AN EFFORT TO DISCREDIT 

241
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:39,083
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

242
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,686
>>  YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED BUT 

243
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,919
YOU MAY ANSWER. 

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,258
>>  NO, NOT AT ALL. 

245
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,057
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

246
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:47,927
>>  YIELDS BACK TO THE 

247
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,495
GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO. 

248
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,696
>>  THANK YOU. 

249
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,499
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN 

250
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,268
INVESTIGATING BOTH THE MATTER 

251
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,503
OF HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL AND 

252
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,905
THE RUSSIAN MATTER IS THAT 

253
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:00,973
CORRECT? 

254
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:01,440
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

255
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,376
>>  AND MRS. PAGE WAS ALSO 

256
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:03,843
INVOLVED. 

257
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,013
>>  SHE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE 

258
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,047
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM. 

259
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,915
SHE WAS A SENIOR STAFF MEMBER 

260
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:11,918
FOR MR. MCABB.  

261
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:18,157
. 

262
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,492
>>> YOU WOULD AGREE THAT BOTH 

263
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,694
INVESTIGATIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO 

264
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,460
BE FAIR AND UNBIASED? 

265
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,497
>>  YES AND THEY WERE. 

266
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,700
>>  YET YOU WERE BOTH ROOTING 

267
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,902
FOR CLINTON TO WIN AND YOU BOTH 

268
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,470
DETESTED DONALD TRUMP, DID YOU 

269
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:31,670
NOT? 

270
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,172
>>  THINK I THAT'S FAIR TO SAY. 

271
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,474
>>  AND IN FACT AS WE HAVE 

272
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,377
LEARNED YOU APPARENTLY FOUND 

273
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,545
DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS 

274
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,646
DETESTABLE TOO LIKE THOSE 

275
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,482
AROUND VIRGINIA WHO WE HAVE 

276
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,985
HEARD WHO YOU CALLED IGNORANT 

277
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,889
BLANKS, I WON'T SAY THAT HERE 

278
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,056
AND THAT YOU HAD VISITED A WAL-

279
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:53,426
MART AND COULD SMELL THE TRUMP 

280
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:53,693
SUPPORT. 

281
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,161
WHEN I READ THOSE 

282
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,495
COMMUNICATIONS AND WHEN I HEAR 

283
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,797
THEM HERE, THOSE BETWEEN THE 

284
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,830
TWO OF YOU SPECIFICALLY WHAT 

285
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,500
YOU HAD TO SAY ABOUT TRUMP 

286
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,034
SUPPORTERS. 

287
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,302
IT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING 

288
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,071
THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD SAID 

289
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:06,672
ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS. 

290
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:11,577
SHE FOUND THEM -- WHAT DID THEY 

291
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:11,977
CALL THEM? 

292
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:12,310
DEPLORABLES. 

293
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,580
I WOULD SUBMIT THAT IT WAS YOUR 

294
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,917
AND HILLARY CLINTON'S SMUG VIEW 

295
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,619
OF DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS 

296
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,186
THAT WAS TRULY DEPLORABLE. 

297
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:22,021
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE 

298
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,089
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE 

299
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,226
PAYING YOUR SALARIES, PAYING 

300
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,160
FOR A FAIR AND UNBIASED 

301
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,629
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI 

302
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,032
DESERVED A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT 

303
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,402
THOSE COMMENTS I JUST REFERRED 

304
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:36,968
TO REFLECT? 

305
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:37,736
>>  TWO THINGS. 

306
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:38,671
ONE I ABSOLUTELY REGRET THE 

307
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,772
APPEARANCE OF SOME OF THOSE 

308
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,074
TEXTS AND WISH I WOULD HAVE 

309
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,976
SAID OR PHRASED OR NOT SAID 

310
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,377
WHAT I DID. 

311
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:51,350
TWO I TAKE -- I DISAGREE 

312
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,650
COMPLETELY. 

313
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,418
I NEVER SAID THAT. 

314
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,452
I EXPRESSED NO SUCH THING. 

315
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,521
THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS 

316
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,822
AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. 

317
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,358
>>  WE HEARD THEM HERE. 

318
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,393
LET ME -- I JUST. 

319
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,060
>>  [INAUDIBLE]. 

320
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,497
>>  YOU TOLD LISA PAGE AND I 

321
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,031
WILL QUOTE HERE. 

322
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,833
I LOATHE CONGRESS AND SHE 

323
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,534
AGREED. 

324
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,102
YOU ARE PROBABLY IN GOOD 

325
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:10,569
COMPANY THERE. 

326
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,371
A SURVEY I SAW A WHILE BACK 

327
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:16,642
ABOUT CONGRESS FOUND US LESS 

328
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,511
POPULAR THAN ROOT CANALS AND 

329
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,480
HEAD LICE THOUGH WE DID BEAT 

330
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,716
OUT PLAYGROUND BULLIES AND 

331
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:23,949
EBOLA. 

332
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:24,683
THIS IS NOT ABOUT US. 

333
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,620
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND WHETHER OR 

334
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,621
NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN 

335
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,322
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE 

336
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,223
INVESTIGATIONS THAT YOU ARE 

337
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,425
INVOLVED IN AND WHETHER YOU 

338
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,628
WERE FAIR AND UNBIASED WHEN YOU 

339
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,328
INVESTIGATED BOTH HILLARY 

340
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,863
CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP. 

341
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,463
WOULD YOU AGREE? 

342
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,232
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN 

343
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:40,833
VERY MUCH. 

344
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,635
LET ME EXPLAIN ABOUT THAT 

345
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:42,902
COMMENT. 

346
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,504
I HAVE THE YOU MOST RESPECT FOR 

347
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,372
CONGRESS, IT'S ROLE AND 

348
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:46,672
OVERSIGHT. 

349
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,907
FOR ITS ROLE IN PASSING LAWS 

350
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,608
AND ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS. 

351
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,611
WHAT I WAS STATING IN THAT 

352
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,414
COMMENT WAS THE EFFORTS BY SOME 

353
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,382
TO TURN REAL OVERSIGHT ACTIVITY 

354
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,450
INTO UNWARRANTED. 

355
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,218
>>  WE APPRECIATE. 

356
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,720
>  CRITICISM OF THE FBI FOR THE 

357
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,521
FBI DOING ITS JOB. 

358
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,857
>>  A LOST US UP HERE DON'T 

359
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:05,291
LIKE CONGRESS TOO. 

360
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:05,925
>>  I'M SURE. 

361
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,160
>>  A LOT OF THE AMERICAN 

362
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,564
PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON 

363
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:11,864
THAT. 

364
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,433
MR. STRZOK, YOU WERE REMOVED 

365
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,101
FROM THE INVESTIGATION, 

366
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:15,367
CORRECT? 

367
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:15,701
>>  YES. 

368
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,404
>>  FOR THE MOST PART ALL THE 

369
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,706
OTHERS THAT WERE THERE ARE 

370
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,673
STILL THERE, CORRECT? 

371
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,108
>>  I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE 

372
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:23,508

WHAT THE INVESTIGATION IS 

540
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,048
LOOKING INTO IS RUSSIAN

1089
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,508
I THINK THAT LINE OF 

1090
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,809
QUESTIONING I'M GLAD THE FBI

IF SOMETHING IS NOTABLE OR HIGH

LEVEL I MAY BE INVOLVED BUT IT 

1128
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,474
WOULD BE RARE IF NEVER THAT I

1135
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,717

1136
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:47,016

COLLEAGUES IN THE MAJORITY ARE 

1150
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,379
MORE INTERESTED IN YOUR TEXT 

1151
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,115
MESSAGES THAN THEY ARE ABOUT 

1152
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,619
THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD 

1153
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,422

1154
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,623
UNDERMINE THE WESTERN ALLIANCE. 

1155
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:29,060
IT JUST AMAZING ME SPECIAL 

1156
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,463

1157
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,932
INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST YOU 

1158
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,635
KNOW ALL TO WELL THE CONSTANT 

1159
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,405
AND GROWING DANGER THAT THE 

1160
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:45,610
RUSSIAN FEDERATION POSES TO 

1161
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,710
THIS COUNTRY. 

1162
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,512
OUR ALLIESS AND TO DEMOCRACY IN 

1163
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:48,913
GENERAL. 

1164
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,382
AT SHOCKING THAT MY COLLEAGUES 

1165
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:56,354
IN THE MAJORITY CONTINUE TO 

1166
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,156
RELITIGATE A 2016 ELECTION 

1167
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,724
WHILE THE PRESIDENT DOES MORE 

1168
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:04,362
DAMAGE IN THE WESTERN -- TO THE 

1169
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,464
WESTERN ALLIANCE THAN THE SUM 

1170
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,467
TOTAL OF ALL PREVIOUS RUSSIAN

00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:15,005
AND SOVIET LEADERS COULD HAVE 

1172
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:15,806
DREAMED OF. 

1173
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,744
IT'S REMARKABLE THAT MR. TRUMP 

1174
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,911
ACCUSED OUR TRUSTED ALLY 

1175
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:24,281
GERMANY OF BEING -- AND I 

1176
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:26,650
QUOTE, TOTALLY UNDER THE 

1177
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,585
CONTROL OF RUSSIA. 

1178
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:32,056
I WOULD SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1179
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,090
IS HALF RIGHT. 

1180
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,091
SOMEONE IS TOTALLY UNDER 

1181
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:38,262
CONTROL OF RUSSIA BUT IT'S NOT 

1182
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:38,863
GERMANY. 

1183
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,665
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 

1184
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:44,869
LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND EXPLAIN 

1185
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,938
WHY NEARLY EVERY DECISION HE 

1186
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:54,612
MAKES AND EVERY WORD HE UTTERS 

1187
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,946

1193
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:11,161
IS SO EAGER TO PUNISH OUR 

1194
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:11,929
ALLIES PLEASE PUTIN? 

1195
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,498

THAT, NO. 

1197
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,934

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND

INFORMATION THAT WOULD

INCRIMINATE HILLARY AND HER 

1213
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:52,737

HAVE JUST ARRIVED FOR BLACK TIE 

1218

00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,220
THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER IS

THEY ARE BEING GREETED BY ROLAY

00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:13,957
GUARDS AND BANDS. 

1226
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,427
ITS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF 

1227
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:16,694
SECURITY. 

1228
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,928
ALSO PROTESTS AGAINST MR. 

1229
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:18,863
TRUMP'S TRIP.  

1230
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:28,839
. 

1231
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,107
>>> WE WANT TO GO BACK CAPITOL

WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE 

1234
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,912
PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO THE UNITED 

1235
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:35,179
KINGDOM. 

1236
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:35,479
>>  AGAIN.

NOT RELATING IT TO ANY 

1238
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,882
PARTICULAR EVENT. 

1239
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:42,853
I THINK THE HYPOTHETICAL WOULD 

1240
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,489
BE CONCERNING BECAUSE A HOSTILE 

1241
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,357
FOREIGN POWER, ONE THAT 

1242
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,325
HOSTILITY IS THEIR NATTER ARE 

1243
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:48,959
ADVERSE TO OURS. 

1244
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,629
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE 

1245
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,165
MEETING OR ATTEMPTING TO WORK 

1246
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,966
TOGETHER SUGGESTS A VARIETY OF 

1247
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,167
POTENTIAL CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS. 

1248
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,669
I THINK IT WOULD GIVE CONCERN 

1249
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,237
ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONS AND THE 

1250
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,607
ACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED 

1251
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,110
AND WHETHER OR NOT -- WHOSE 

1252
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,344
INTEREST, WHETHER AMERICA OR 

1253
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,914
THAT HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER THEY 

1254
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,382
WERE  WORKING TOWARD. 

1255
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:14,852

INTERFERENCE ATTEMPTS TO THE 

1260
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,059

1341
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,113
COMMITTEE THAT YOU SEPARATED 

1342

OUT YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS ANY 

1343
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,450
ACTION THAT YOU TOOK. 

1344
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,554
YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I'M 

1345
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:03,854
CONFIDENT. 

1346
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,056
AS IMPLAUSIBLE AS THAT SOUNDS 

1347
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,860
WE HAVE LISTENED TO THE DEFENSE 

1348
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,262
OF THAT ARGUMENT THAT NO MATTER 

1349
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:13,163
HOW BIASED AND HOW PROFANE IN 

1350
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,198
THAT BIAS WERE YOU IT DIDN'T 

1351
00:42:15,198 --> 00:42:15,799
AFFECT YOUR JUDGEMENTS. 

1352
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,568
THAT'S A HARD ARGUMENT TO MAKE 

1353
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,269
BUT I RECALL YOUR RESPONSE TO 

1354
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:20,638
MR. DUNCAN OF TENNESSEE ON THAT 

1355

TOPIC AND YOU SAID I DON'T 

1356
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,542
AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF MY VIEWS 

1357
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:25,875
AS BIASED. 

1358
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,545
DO YOU HOLD WITH THAT POSITION 

1359
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,312
THAT YOUR VIEWS NOT BIASED? 

1360
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:31,582
WHETHER OR NOT THEY -- IT 

1361
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,083
COLORED YOUR ACTIVITIES AS AN 

1362
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:33,484
AGENT? 

1363
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,786
>>  I BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T COLOR 

1364
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,722
THEM AND THEY ARE NOT BIASED. 

1365
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,491
>>  THE TEXTS THAT YOU 

1366
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,092

>>  THEY DON'T. 

1370
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,630
WHY? 

1371
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:47,897
BECAUSE. 

1372
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:48,666

1377
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,374
>>  RECLAIMING MY TIME. 

1378
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,878
ONE THIN THAT YOU FOUND A WAY 

1379
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,379
TO WALL OFF YOUR BIAS BUT IT'S 

1380
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,281
NOT POSSIBLE TO TAKE UNDER OATH 

1381
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,683
AND TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

1382
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,084
AND IN COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS 

1383
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:08,619
NOT BIAS. 

1384
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:12,022
IF THERE -- THE EVIDENCE OF 

1385
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,290
THIS BIAS IS THROUGHOUT THESE 

1386
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,325

1387
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:16,927

>>  YES I WAS.  

1392
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,905
PAUSING BECAUSE -- I THINK 

1393
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:28,505
SECOND OR THIRD. 

1394
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:29,673
IF YOU SAY IT'S THE SECOND IT'S 

1395
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:30,006
THE SECOND. 

1396
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:32,209
>>  SECOND IS THE DATE I 

1397
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:32,876

THE TWO AGENTS DID. 

1441

>>  I EXPECTD  THAT ANSWER. 

1450
00:44:56,993 --> 00:45:00,464
WE MUST KNOW WHO WAS IN THAT 

1451
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:00,864
ROOM. 

1452
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,266
WE MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE 

1453
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,967
NOTES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY 

1454
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:07,337
USED TO PUT TOGETHER THE 302 

1455
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,338

00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,146
DRAFTED BASED ON THE MEMORIES 

1462
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,881

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

1649
00:50:59,822 --> 00:51:02,224
ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 

1650
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:05,462
>>  ME AS PART OF A LARGE 

1651
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,163
NUMBER OF FOLKS, YES. 

1652
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:11,067

1653
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:14,237
DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE ABOUT 

1654
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,338
RUSSIAN SPYING ACTIVITIES, 

1655
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,841
THEIR SOURCES AND METHODS AS 

1656
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,176
THEY SEPARATE IN THE UNITED 

1657
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:22,345
STATES AND IN OTHER ALLIED 

1658
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,280
NATIONS ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 

1659
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:23,713
>>  CERTAINLY TRUE. 

1660
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,882
THEN THE UNITED STATES AND TO A 

1661
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:26,849
LESSER EXTENT OVERSEAS. 

1662
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:28,985

1663
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,854
KEEP AMERICA SAFE? 

1664
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:31,888
>>  I HAVE SIR. 

1665
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,790
IT'S MY PROUD -- MY PROUD DUTY 

1666
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,457
TO HAVE DONE SO. 

1667
00:51:34,457 --> 00:51:37,093
>>  THERE'S A LOT MORE TO YOUR 

1668
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,996
CAREER THAN A FEW E-MAILS ISN'T 

1669
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:40,363
THAT CORRECT? 

1670
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:40,830
AND TEXT MESSAGES? 

1671
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:41,230
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 

1672
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:44,401
>>  SO TO BOIL IT DOWN TO THAT 

1673
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,137
IS REALLY A DISSERVICE TO YOU. 

1674
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,573
I THINK AS OPPOSED TO THE

THIS ITEM ON CLINTON'S E-MAILS

GOING THROUGH A PRIVATE SERVER

00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:12,182
AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE THE 

1738
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:14,250
ANALYSIS THEY FOUND THAT HER E-

1739
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,654
MAILS, EVERY SINGLE ONE EXCEPT 

1740
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:22,659
FOR FOUR, OVER 30,000 OF THEM 

1741
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,828
WERE GOING TO AN ADDRESS NOT ON 

1742
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:26,896
THE LIST. 

1743
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,833
IT WAS A BIT OF INFORMATION 

1744
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,301
THAT WAS SENTING TO AN 

1745
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:31,968
UNAUTHORIZED SOURCE. 

1746
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,336
DO YOU RECALL THAT? 

1747
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,638
>>  SIR, I DON'T. 

1748
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:38,708
>>  WELL -- IT WENT ONTO 

1749
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,175
EXPLAIN IT. 

1750
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,176
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. 

1751
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:43,279
YOU THANKED HIM. 

1752
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:46,449
YOU SHOOK HIS HAND BUT THE 

1753
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,553
PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WAS GOING 

1754
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:54,557
TO AN UNAUTHORIZED SOURCE THAT 

1755
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,159
WAS A FOREIGN ENTITY UNRELATED 

1756
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,562
TO RUSSIA AND FROM WHAT YOU 

1757
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,964
HAVE SAID HERE YOU DID NOTHING 

1758
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,367
MORE THAN NOD AND SHAKE THE 

1759
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,971
MAN'S HAND WHEN YOU DIDN'T SEEM 

1760
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,640
TO BE ALL THAT CONCERNED ABOUT 

1761
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,609
OUR NATIONAL INTEGRITY OF OUR 

1762
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:22,017
ELECTION WHEN IF WAS INVOLVING 

1763
00:55:22,017 --> 00:55:22,418
HILLARY CLINTON. 

1764
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:28,057
SO, THE EXAMINATION WAS DONE BY 

1765
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:30,159
THE ICIG AND THEY CAN DOCUMENT 

1766
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:31,961
THAT BUT YOU WERE GIVEN THAT 

1767
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,197
INFORMATION AND YOU DID NOTHING 

1768
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,465
WITH IT. 

1769
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:41,938
ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND THE 

1770
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,339
MOST EGREG RIOUS -- HOROWITZ 

1771
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,442
GOT A CALL FOUR TIMES BY 

1772
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,344
SOMEONE WANTING TO BRIEF HIM, 

1773
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,446
LEAVING MESSAGES, TELLING HIM 

1774
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,282
ABOUT THIS AND HE NEVER 

1775
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:54,517
RETURNED THE CALLS. 

1776
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,954
HE HAD 500 PAGES OF BIAS THAT 

1777
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,389
HE GAVE US AND THEN THREW A 

1778
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,191
BONE TO THE DEMOCRATS AND SAID 

1779
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,093
WE CAN'T FIND BIAS. 

1780
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:05,395
WHEN YOU HAVE TEXT MESSAGES MR. 

1781
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,697
STRZOK THE WAY YOU DO, SAYING 

1782
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,599
THE THINGS YOU DID, YOU HAVE 

1783
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,101
BEEN BETTER OFF COMING IN AND 

1784
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:13,403
SAYING, LOOK, THAT WAS MY BIAS. 

1785
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,238
YOU KIND OF GET AROUND TO THAT 

1786
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:18,575
A BIT WHEN YOU SAY HEY, YOU 

1787
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,578
KNOW, EVERYBODY HAS POLITICAL 

1788
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:21,978
VIEWS. 

1789
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:22,678
THOSE ARE CALLED BIASES. 

1790
00:56:22,678 --> 00:56:24,447
WE ALL HAVE THEM AND YOU HAVE 

1791
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,817
COME IN HERE AND SAID, I HAVE 

1792
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:28,084
NO BIAS. 

1793
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,586
YOU DO IT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE 

1794
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:32,188
AND I WATCHED YOU IN THE 

1795
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:32,755
PRIVATE TESTIMONY YOU GAVE. 

1796
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:35,492
I TOLD SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS 

1797
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,893
HE IS REALLY GOOD. 

1798
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,960
HE IS LYING. 

1799
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:45,168
HE  KNOWS WE KNOW HE IS LYING 

1800
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,803
HE PROBABLY PASS A POLYBRAPH. 

1801
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:47,703
>>  POINT OF ORDER. 

1802
00:56:47,703 --> 00:56:48,304
THIS POINT OF ORDER. 

1803
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:48,737
>>  NO. 

1804
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:49,772
>>  THE GENTLEMAN WILL STATE 

1805
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:50,673
HIS POINT OF ORDER. 

1806
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,075
>>  THE MEMBER OF THIS 

1807
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,276
COMMITTEE JUST ASSERTED THAT 

1808
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,577
THIS WITNESS WHO IS UNDER OATH 

1809
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,013
AND A FORMER AGENT OF THE FBI 

1810
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:57,213
LIED. 

1811
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,148
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT I ASK 

1812
00:56:59,148 --> 00:56:59,682
HIM TO WITHDRAW IT. 

1813
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:04,854
>>  I DO NOT WITHDRAW IT. 

1814
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,988
HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF CONGRESS 

1815
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:08,124
AND JUST AS YOU HAVE BEEN 

1816
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:08,724
EXPRESSING BIAS THROUGH YOUR 

1817
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,426
MEMBERS ABOUT WHAT A HERO HE 

1818
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,427
IS. 

1819
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,729
>>  WILL NOT A SINGLE PERSON 

1820
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:15,031
WHO HAS. 

1821
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:15,999
>>  GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE 

1822
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:16,232
ISLAND. 

1823
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:17,467
>>  IT'S MY TIME. 

1824
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,901
>>  THAT'S A DISGRACE. 

1825
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:20,803
>>  GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE ISLAND

TRUMP WON'T WIN BUT HE COULD 

2035
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,649
STILL STEP ASIDE AND LET 

2036
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,316
SOMEONE ELSE TRY. 

2037
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:40,749
DID YOU WRITE THAT? 

2038
01:03:40,749 --> 01:03:43,819

HE SHOULD BE HERE AS WELL 

2044
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:53,029
APPARENTLY. 

2045
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,796
MY WIFE AND I, WE HAVE A 15-

2046
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:55,230
YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. 

2047
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,232
DO YOU THINK I CAN LOOK HER IN 

2048
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,235
THE EYE AND TELL THEIR THAT I 

2049
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,636
ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE 

2050
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,705
ACTS LIKE THIS AND HIS APOLOGY 

2051
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,573
THAT WAS NO APOLOGY. 

2052
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:05,908
THAT WAS AN APOLOGY FORGETTING 

2053
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:06,141
CAUGHT. 

2054
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:07,410
I CAN'T TELL THE GOOD POPE ARE 

2055
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:10,313

ENDORSED A PERSON WHO AC ACTS 

2057
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:12,748
LIKE. 

2058
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:13,149
WAS THAT YOU? 

2059
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:13,815
>>  NO. 

2060
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:16,152
IT WAS A FORMER CHAIRMAN OF MY 

2061
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:16,452
COMMITTEE. 

2062
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:17,553
DID YOU WRITE THE FOLLOWING. 

2063
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,754
FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, 

2064
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,390
AND TO GIVE THE REPUBLICANS A 

2065
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,628
CHANCE AT DEFEATING CLINTON, 

2066
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,962
MR. TRUMP SHOULD STEP ASIDE. 

2067
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:28,364
HIS DEFEAT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN 

2068
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,732
AND FOUR YEARS OF CLINTON IS 

2069
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,133
NOT WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS 

2070
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:31,834
COUNTRY. 

2071
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,903
MR. TRUMP SHOULD DO THE RIGHT 

2072
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:34,136
THING? 

2073
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:35,571
THAT'S YOU, RIGHT? 

2074
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:39,007
>>  NO. 

2075
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:39,674
>>  NO. 

2076
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:40,442
YOU ARE RIGHT. 

2077
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:42,411
IT WAS THE REPUBLICAN 

2078
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,079
CONGRESSMAN FROM COLORADO. 

2079
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,613
DONALD TRUMP SHOULD STEP ASIDE 

2080
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:47,049
AND LET THE PARTY REPLACE HIM 

2081
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:50,986
WITH MIKE PENCE OR ANOTHER 

2082
01:04:50,986 --> 01:04:51,720
APPROPRIATE NOMINEE. 

2083
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,822
I WOULD NEVER VOTE FOR CLINTON. 

2084
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:54,790
THAT'S YOURS. 

2085
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,425
>>  NO. 

2086
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,359
>>  NO. 

2087
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,161
THAT'S REPUBLICAN BARBARA 

2088
01:04:59,161 --> 01:04:59,928
CONSTACK OF VIRGINIA. 

2089
01:04:59,928 --> 01:05:00,429
HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. 

2090
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,965
IT'S NOW CLEAR TRUMP IS NOT FIT 

2091
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,968
TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

2092
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:06,936
STATES AND CANNOT DEFEAT 

2093
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:07,236
CLINTON. 

2094
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,437
I BELIEVE HE SHOULD STEP ASIDE 

2095
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,406
AND LET THE GOVERNOR LEAD THE 

2096
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,040
TICKET. 

2097
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,507
YOU WROTE THAT ONE? 

2098
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,874
>>  NO. 

2099
01:05:12,874 --> 01:05:14,443
>>  YOU DIDN'T? 

2100
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,278
NO YOU ARE RIGHT. 

2101
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:18,614
THAT'S REPUBLICAN BRADLEY BURN 

2102
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,915
OF ALABAMA. 

2103
01:05:19,915 --> 01:05:21,150
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE? 

2104
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:21,951
TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR MAKES HIM 

2105
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,153
UNACCEPTABLE AND I WON'T VOTE 

2106
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:24,453
FOR HIM. 

2107
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:25,955
AS DISAPPOINTED AS I HAVE BEEN 

2108
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,056
WITH HIM THROUGHOUT THIS 

2109
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,658
CAMPAIGN I THOUGHT SUPPORTING 

2110
01:05:29,658 --> 01:05:31,760
THE NOMINEE WAS THE BEST THING 

2111
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,162
FOR THE COUNTRY NOW ITS CLEAR 

2112
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,064
THAT THE BEST THING IS FOR 

2113
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:38,467
TRUMP TO STEP ASIDE AND ALLOW 

2114
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,469
RESPONSIBLE, RESPECTABLE 

2115
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,070
REPUBLICANS TO LEAD THE TICKET. 

2116
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,039
YOU WROTE THAT ONE. 

2117
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,408
>>  NO. 

2118
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:47,709
>>  NO. 

2119
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:50,212
THAT WAS THE REPUBLICAN OF 

2120
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:50,478
ALABAMA. 

2121
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:54,283
I ASK THAT YOU MR. TRUMP WITH 

2122
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,484
ALL DUE RESPECT STEP ASIDE. 

2123
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:55,784
STEP DOWN. 

2124
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:58,554
ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO CARRY THE 

2125
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:58,787
BANNER. 

2126
01:05:58,787 --> 01:05:59,355
YOU WROTE THAT ONE. 

2127
01:05:59,355 --> 01:05:59,588
>>  NO. 

2128
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:03,091
>>  NO YOU ARE RIGHT AGAIN. 

2129
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:04,160
THAT WAS THE REPUBLICAN FROM 

2130
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:04,560
UTAH. 

2131
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,861
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU WERE 

2132
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:06,862
WRITING THESE E-MAILS IN THE 

2133
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:08,464
HEAT OF THE CAMPAIGN YOU HAD A 

2134
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,366
LOT OF GOOD COMPANY ON THE 

2135
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,602
REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE. 

2136
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:16,872
NOW YOU ARE AN ORPHAN. 

2137
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,607
I WONDER WHAT CHANGED. 

2138
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:22,344
YOUR OPINION WAS HARDLY A 

2139
01:06:22,344 --> 01:06:22,744
STRIKING ONE. 

2140
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:23,144
HARDLY UNUSUAL. 

2141
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:24,513
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU AND I LIVE, 

2142
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,448
NORTHERN VIRGINIA, IS THAT 

2143
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:26,715
úCOR 

2144
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:26,982
>>  YES. 

2145
01:06:26,982 --> 01:06:32,520

MAIL CRITICIZING THE CANDIDATE 

2147
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,792
TRUMP AND PREDICTING HE WOULD 

2148
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,494
LOOSE WAS NOT AN ISOLATED KIND 

2149
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,761
OF OPINION IS THAT CORRECT? 

2150
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:41,797
>>  NO IT WAS NOT TO MY 

2151
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:42,097
KNOWLEDGE. 

2152
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:45,968
>>  AND DO YOU UNDER OATH 

2153
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,137
CONFIRM WHAT THE INSPECTOR 

2154
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,972

2155
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,174
EVIDENCE YOUR AMERICAN OPINION

>>  I DO. 

2160

>>  THAT ITS YOUR TESTIMONY? 

2161
01:06:59,148 --> 01:06:59,481

2162
01:06:59,481 --> 01:07:01,784

THOSE PEOPLE, WHOEVER THEY ARE 

2188
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,377
CANNOT BE BIASED, ONE WAY OR 

2189
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:02,511
THE OTHER. 

2190
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,881
IS IT IT STARTS IN COURTROOM 

2191
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:06,682
WITH THE JURY. 

2192
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,218
THE LAWYERS SEND A LOT OF TIME 

2193
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,921
TALKING TO JURORS ABOUT IF THEY 

2194
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,822
ARE BIASED BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO 

2195
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:15,324
ARE BIASED OR APPEAR BIASED ARE 

2196
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:15,824
OUT OF HERE. 

2197
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:18,926
YOU CAN'T SERVE ON THE JURY. 

2198
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:21,196
YOU CANNOT BE FAIR. 

2199
01:08:21,196 --> 01:08:23,232
WE DON'T LET JUDGES SERVE ON 

2200
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:28,970
CASES IF THEY HAVE A BIAS. 

2201
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,638
THEY ARE  RECUSED. 

2202
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:31,273
THEY DO IT THEMSELVES. 

2203
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,309
THEY RECOGNIZE THEY HAVE A BIAS 

2204
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,010
AND WE DON'T LET PEOPLE TESTIFY 

2205
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,511
UNLESS THE BIASED WHEN THEY 

2206
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:38,279
TESTIFY IS ALLOWED TO BE 

2207
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:38,613
BROUGHT OUT. 

2208
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:40,749
IF A WITNESS IS TESTIFYING 

2209
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:41,783
LET'S SAY YOU FOR EXAMPLE. 

2210
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:44,019
BOTH SIDES ARE ENTITLED TO 

2211
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,220
BRING OUT THE BIAS FOR OR 

2212
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,624
AGAINST  THE -- ABOUT THE 

2213
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,925
WITNESS THAT IS AGAINST THE 

2214
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,127
OFFENDER, LET'S USE IN THAT 

2215
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:55,231
CASE BECAUSE IN OUR JUSTICE 

2216
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:58,934
SYSTEM THINGS MUST BE FAIR AND 

2217
01:08:58,934 --> 01:08:59,835
THINGS MUST LOOK FAIR. 

2218
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,805
THERE MUST NOT BE BIAS AND 

2219
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:05,707
THERE MUST NOT BE A LOOK OF 

2220
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:06,541
BIAS BY ANYONE. 

2221
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:11,113
THAT IS THE WAY OUR SYSTEM 

2222
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:11,345
WORKS. 

2223
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:12,781
NOW, IN MY OPINION WHO HAS -- 

2224
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,149
MY OPINION IS NOT BETTER THAN 

2225
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:15,417
ANYONE ELSE US BUT I HAVE SEEN 

2226
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,953
A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS. 

2227
01:09:18,953 --> 01:09:22,625
KIND OF IN THE PEOPLE BUSINESS, 

2228
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:22,992
JUDGING PEOPLE. 

2229
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,260
I HAVE HEARD YOUR STATEMENTS TO 

2230
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,529
TODAY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT 

2231
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:31,133
YOUR OWN WORDS HAVE SHOWN YOUR 

2232
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:31,433
BIAS. 

2233
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,234
YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT BIASED BUT 

2234
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:37,606
WE BASE THINGS ON EVIDENCE, NOT 

2235
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:38,939
BASED NECESSARILY ON WORDS. 

2236
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:42,711
YOUR WORDS TO ME PROVE YOUR 

2237
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:43,412
BIAS. 

2238
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:44,046
YOUR ATTITUDE PROVES YOUR BIAS. 

2239
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,113
YOUR ARROGANCE PROVES YOUR BIAS 

2240
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:47,950
AND I THINK YOUR PROTESTING TO 

2241
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:48,649
MUCH PROVES YOUR BIAS. 

2242
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:50,252
BEING THAT AS IT MAY THE SCARY 

2243
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:52,520
PART OF THAT IS NOT IF YOU ARE 

2244
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,257
BIASED OR NOT, THE SCARY PART 

2245
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:58,160
OF IT IS WHAT ABOUT OTHER 

2246
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,361
PEOPLE IN THE FBI? 

2247
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,863
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW 

2248
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,767
ABOUT THAT HAVE THE SAME 

2249
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,769
ATTITUDE THAT YOU DO ABOUT 

2250
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,138
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING 

2251
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,607
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI? 

2252
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,242
THAT IS WHAT IS SCARY BECAUSE 

2253
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,709
PEOPLE OUT HERE, THE REST OF US 

2254
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:19,548
WHO DON'T GET TO WORK FOR THE 

2255
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,583
FBI OR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 

2256
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:22,885
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR 

2257
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,587
JUSTICE SYSTEM DOING THE RIGHT 

2258
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,789
THING FOR THE RIGHT REASON. 

2259
01:10:27,789 --> 01:10:29,291
MAKING SURE THAT OUR JUSTICE 

2260
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:33,862
SYSTEM IS JUST AND PART OF THE 

2261
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,864
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE IS THAT 

2262
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:36,931
THERE ISN'T A BIAS FOR OR 

2263
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:40,636
AGAINST ANYONE AS THEY GO 

2264
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:41,203
THROUGH THE SYSTEM. 

2265
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:43,238
NOW, BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID I 

2266
01:10:43,238 --> 01:10:44,740
DON'T THINK I WOULD EVER ALLOW 

2267
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,477
YOU AS A JUROR TO BE ON A 

2268
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:48,944
CRIMINAL CASE. 

2269
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:49,144
EVER. 

2270
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:49,778
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE DEFENSOR 

2271
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:50,546
ATTORNEY OR THE PROSECUTOR 

2272
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:54,783
WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BE ON A 

2273
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:58,654
JUROR BECAUSE YOUR WORDS ARE 

2274
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,288
WHAT WE HEAR. 

2275
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:02,791
YOUR PROTESTING JUST SEEMS TO 

2276
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,028
MAKE THOSE WORDS MORE OF A SHOW 

2277
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:06,595
OF YOUR BIAS. 

2278
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:11,100
THE COMMENT THAT YOU ARE GOING 

2279
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,700
TO STOP HIM. 

2280
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,303
THAT NOT ONLY SHOWS YOUR BIAS, 

2281
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:15,370
THAT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE GOING 

2282
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,372
TO ACT ON IT AND YOU ARE GOING 

2283
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:19,107
TO STOP PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

2284
01:11:19,107 --> 01:11:24,880
THAT'S THE WAY IT COMES ACROSS. 

2285
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,214
THE EVIDENCECOMES ACROSS. 

2286
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:29,084
SO, HOW DO YOU ASSURE US THAT 

2287
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:30,519
THE ATTITUDE THAT YOU HAVE 

2288
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,221
SHOWN US TODAY OF THE TEXT 

2289
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:35,090
MESSAGES AND ALL OF THIS THINGS 

2290
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,525
THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 

2291
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,527
ABOUT, HOW DO WE KNOW THAT'S 

2292
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,496
NOT RAMPANT THROUGHOUT THE FBI? 

2293
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,531
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? 

2294
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:45,300
>>  SIR, WHAT I WOULD ANSWER TO 

2295
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,034
YOU. 

2296
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:47,903
>>  YOU CAN ANSWER THAT 

2297
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:48,771
QUESTION? 

2298
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,173
HOW DO WE KNOW THERE ISN'T BIAS 

2299
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,375
IN THE FBI AND THIS PARTICULAR 

2300
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:53,875
INVESTIGATION OR OTHER 

2301
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:54,242
INVESTIGATIONS? 

2302
01:11:54,242 --> 01:11:55,077
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? 

2303
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:58,146
>>  THE WAY THAT YOU DO THAT IS 

2304
01:11:58,146 --> 01:12:00,215
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SUGGESTED. 

2305
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:01,082
YOU LOOK TO THE EVIDENCE. 

2306
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:02,918
YOU LOOK TO THE ACTIONS OF THE 

2307
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,220
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FBI AND 

2308
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,054
THE CONDUCT OF THE CASES. 

2309
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:08,824
YOU LOOK TO MY ACTIONS IN THE 

2310
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,793
CONDUCT OF THE INVESTIGATIONS. 

2311
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,529
YOU HAVE DONE WITH OTHERS A 

2312
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,431
FANTASTIC JOB OF PUTTING THE 

2313
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:16,632
WORD BIAS WITH PERSONAL 

2314
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:19,034
POLITICAL BELIEF AND IT'S 

2315
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,102
ASTOUNDING HOW EFFECTIVE THAT'S 

2316
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:20,736
BEEN. 

2317
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:23,205
YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. 

2318
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:23,972
THE FACT OF BIAS. 

2319
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,307
>>  RECLAIMING MY TIME. 

2320
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:26,608
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO TRY 

2321
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,010
TO ANSWER THE OTHER QUESTION 

2322
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,745
THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ANSWER. 

2323
01:12:30,745 --> 01:12:32,714
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE 

2324
01:12:32,714 --> 01:12:35,351
ATTITUDE THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN US 

2325
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,219
TODAY, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO 

2326
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:37,486
CALL IT. 

2327
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,521
SOME WANT TO MAKE A SAINT OUT 

2328
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,589
OF YOU. 

2329
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:45,327
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE FEUD 

2330
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,062
ISN'T THE SAME ONE OF THE FBI? 

2331
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,897
>>  I WOULD ASK THAT THE 

2332
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,100
WITNESS BE PERMITTED TO ANSWER. 

2333
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,033
>>  THE GENTLEMAN MAY ANSWER. 

2334
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:53,068
>>  HOPEFULLY WOULDN'T 

2335
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:53,401
INTERRUPTION. 

2336
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,604
>>  THE WAY YOU JUDGE THAT IS 

2337
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:56,805
WHAT I SAID. 

2338
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,873
YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. 

2339
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:01,443
YOU LOOK AT THE ACTS, WHAT FBI 

2340
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,312
AGENTS AND ANALYSTS AND 

2341
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:03,978
EVERYBODY ELSE DO. 

2342
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:06,014
YOU LOOK AT WHAT I DID. 

2343
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,250
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE INSPECTOR 

2344
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,752
GENERAL CONCLUDED, NOT ONLY ME 

2345
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:13,255
BUT ALL OF THE AGENTS AND 

2346
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:14,490
ASSISTANT DIRECTORS AND 

2347
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,826
EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THE 

2348
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,195
INVESTIGATION AND YOU SEE THAT 

2349
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,764
THEVIDENCE IS THERE IS NO ACT 

2350
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:23,031
OF BIAS. 

2351
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,567
SO THIS FALSE ASSERTION THAT 

2352
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,269
YOU ARE MAKING THAT POLITICAL, 

2353
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,337
PERSONAL BELIEF MUST EQUAL 

2354
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,138
BIAS, THAT SOMEHOW WE HAVE 

2355
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:32,841
MERGED THOSE TWO WORDS TOGETHER 

2356
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,142
IS ONE OF THE TRIUMPHS OF 

2357
01:13:34,142 --> 01:13:36,945
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THAT I 

2358
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,046
CAN'T DYSTIMBRIA WITH MORE. 

2359
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:39,881
A JUDGE ASKS JURORS ARE YOU 

2360
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:42,484
ABLE TO SET ASIDE YOUR PERSONAL 

2361
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:43,184
OPINIONS AND RENDER A JUDGEMENT 

2362
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:45,587
BASED ON THE FACTS IN YOU KNOW 

2363
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,289
THAT BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE. 

2364
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:48,757
WHAT I AM TELLING YOU IS THAT I 

2365
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,693
AND THE OTHER MEN AND WOMEN OF 

2366
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,696
THE FBI, EVERY DAY TAKE OUR 

2367
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,965
PERSONAL BELIEFS AND SET THOSE 

2368
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,067
ASIDE IN PURSUIT OF THE TRUTH 

2369
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,269
WHERE IT LIES, WHATEVER IT IS. 

2370
01:14:01,269 --> 01:14:02,838
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. 

2371
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,106
>>  TIME HAS EXPIRED. 

2372
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,642
THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES 

2373
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,109
GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA. 

2374
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:09,812
>>  I THANK THE CHAIRMAN. 

2375
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:12,681
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT'S 

2376
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:13,582
GOING ON HERE. 

2377
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,485
WE UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT 

2378
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:20,389
TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE THIS 

2379
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:20,989
INVESTIGATION. 

2380
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:21,422
WE UNDERSTAND THAT. 

2381
01:14:21,422 --> 01:14:21,789
THAT'S CLEAR. 

2382
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:25,193
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS JOINT 

2383
01:14:25,193 --> 01:14:28,063
COMMITTEE AND IN THE COMMITTEE 

2384
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,498
MEETING JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS 

2385
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:34,369
BACK WITH MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 

2386
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:36,171
DEMEANING THEMSELVES BY  

2387
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,639
ASSERTING THAT THE DEPUTY 

2388
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,942
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAT THERE 

2389
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:43,478
UNDER OATH AND LIED, TODAY 

2390
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:44,947
REPEATED ASSERTIONS THAT MR. 

2391
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,983
STRZOK IS SITTING BEFORE US 

2392
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:54,690
UNDER OATH AND LYING TO US THE 

2393
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:55,991
EFFORTS TO IMPUNE THE 

2394
01:14:55,991 --> 01:15:01,897
CREDITABILITY OF MR. STRZOK AND 

2395
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:04,599
THE ENTIRE FBI. 

2396
01:15:04,599 --> 01:15:04,966
IT'S SHAMEFUL. 

2397
01:15:04,966 --> 01:15:05,333
TRULY SHAMEFUL. 

2398
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:08,203
THE DEPTHS TO WHICH SOME OF MY 

2399
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:11,673
COLLEAGUES HAVE PLUMMETED IN 

2400
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,977
ORDER TO ADVANCE A NARATIVE TO 

2401
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:15,877
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S 

2402
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:17,179
OPPOSITION TO AN INVESTIGATION 

2403
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,179
WHICH IS AN INVESTIGATION AS 

2404
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:19,481
MR. STRZOK POINTED OUT AND AS 

2405
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,918
TO MANY OF US SEEM TO HAVE 

2406
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:26,388
FORGOTTEN IS AN INVESTIGATION 

2407
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,690
INTO THE RUSSIANS EFFORTS TO 

2408
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,027
DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRACY OF 

2409
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:32,995
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? 

2410
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:34,629
I WISH THAT THE ATTACKS THAT 

2411
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:38,934
HAVE BEEN LEVELED AGAINST MR. 

2412
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:43,972
STRZOK, THE ATTACKS ON OUR FBI  

2413
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,607
DIRECTOR. 

2414
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,843
I WISH THERE WAS A SLIGHT 

2415
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,911
DEGREE OF THAT DIRECTED AGAINST 

2416
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:52,381
WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID IN 2016 

2417
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,915
SO WE COULD TO BOTTOM OF THAT 

2418
01:15:53,915 --> 01:15:55,350
AND ANTICIPATE WHAT THEY ARE 

2419
01:15:55,350 --> 01:16:00,522
TRYING TO DO THIS NOVEMBER AND 

2420
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:00,822
IN 2020. 

2421
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:05,327
NOW, MR. STRZOK, THIS IS THE 

2422
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:05,960
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. 

2423
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,830
THE NUMBER ONE FINDING IN THIS 

2424
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:11,033
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT IS 

2425
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,834
THAT THE FBI SHOULDN'T DISCUSS 

2426
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:13,535
ONGOING CRIMINAL 

2427
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:13,902
INVESTIGATIONS. 

2428
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,904
THAT IS WHAT THE IG SAID 

2429
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:16,471
DIRECTOR COMEY DID WRONG. 

2430
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,607
THE IG SAID HE SHOULDN'T HAVE 

2431
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:18,874
DONE IT. 

2432
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,609
THEY WENT INTO GREAT DETAIL 

2433
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,512
ABOUT THE LONGSTANDING PRACTICE 

2434
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:26,014
AND THE REASONS FOR THAT 

2435
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,349
PRACTICE TO PROTECT THE 

2436
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:28,149
INTEGRITY OF ONGOING CRIMINAL 

2437
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:29,351
INVESTIGATIONS, IN THIS CASE 

2438
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,119
THE INVESTIGATION THAT I JUST 

2439
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,188
REFERRED TO AND DIRECT ATTACK 

2440
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:35,023
BY A FOREIGN GROUP. 

2441
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:35,657
LISTENING TO MY REPUBLICAN 

2442
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,559
COLLEAGUES, IT'S ALMOST AS IF 

2443
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:38,760
THEY NEVER READ THE REPORT. 

2444
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,363
LIKE YOU NEVER BOTHERED TO PICK 

2445
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:46,168
IT UP OR WORSE, YOU READ IT AND 

2446
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,535
UNDERSTAND IT BUT DON'T CARE. 

2447
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:50,605
YOU ARE ASKING MR. STRZOK TO DO 

2448
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:54,843
EXACTLY WHAT THE INSPECTOR 

2449
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:55,676
GENERAL SAID NOT TO DO. 

2450
01:16:55,676 --> 01:16:55,943
EXACTLY. 

2451
01:16:55,943 --> 01:16:57,813
MR. STRZOK IF YOU ANSWER THESE 

2452
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:59,514
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED 

2453
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:00,515
ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION ARE 

2454
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,350
YOU CONCERNED THAT THE 

2455
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,351
INSPECTOR GENERAL COULD 

2456
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:04,252
INVESTIGATE YOU AND ISSUE A 

2457
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,687
REPORT JUST LIKE THIS ONE THAT 

2458
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:07,455
SAYS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE 

2459
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,755
DONE THAT? 

2460
01:17:07,755 --> 01:17:09,257
>>  I CERTAINLY -- THAT'S 

2461
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:09,524
POSSIBLE. 

2462
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,526
I WOULD BE MORE WORRY ABOUT THE 

2463
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,028
IMPACT ON THE ONGOING 

2464
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:13,395
INVESTIGATION. 

2465
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:13,795
>>  I UNDERSTAND. 

2466
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:17,365
IT'S A RIDICULOUS POSITION TO 

2467
01:17:17,365 --> 01:17:19,267
PUT YOU IN. 

2468
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:20,168
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL EXPLAINED 

2469
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,871
IN THIS NEARLY 600 PAGE REPORT 

2470
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,039
THAT THE MISTAKE DIRECTOR COMEY 

2471
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:27,142
MADE WAS DISCUSSING THE ONGOING 

2472
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,844
STEPS THE FBI WAS TAKING IN THE 

2473
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:29,344
CLINTON INVESTIGATION. 

2474
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:32,347
WE HAVE HEARD THIS FROM THE 

2475
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:35,283
CHAIRMAN, FROM MY COLLEAGUES, 

2476
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,386
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES. 

2477
01:17:38,386 --> 01:17:39,688
YOU CAN IGNORE THE FBI'S POLICY 

2478
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,690
THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO 

2479
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,357
PROTECT THESE INVESTIGATIONS 

2480
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:45,393
AND I WILL LET YOU TALK ABOUT 

2481
01:17:45,393 --> 01:17:48,997
THAT IN A SECOND AND ANSWER THE 

2482
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,501
QUESTIONS IN WHICH CASE MAYBE 

2483
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,270
YOU TRIGGER AN IG REPORT OR YOU 

2484
01:17:55,270 --> 01:18:00,876
DON'T ANSWER THEM AND MAYBE WE 

2485
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,043
HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT. 

2486
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:03,578
NOW, CAN YOU JUST AGAIN SINCE 

2487
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:05,080
THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY LONG 

2488
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,215
DAY, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY IT'S 

2489
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,518
IMPORTANT NOT TO INTERFERE 

2490
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,285
WITHON GOING CRIMINAL MATTERS? 

2491
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,887
>>  THERE ARE A VARIETY AND I'M 

2492
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,188
SURE I WON'T HAVE ALL THE 

2493
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,123
REASONS BUT THE FIRST IS WE DO 

2494
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:18,026
A LOT OF INVESTIGATIONS WHERE 

2495
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,928
WE NEVER CHARGE ANYONE. 

2496
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:20,495
IT'S NOT FAI TO GIVEN THE 

2497
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,230
INVESTIGATE I'VE POWER WE HAVE 

2498
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:28,470
TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT 

2499
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,270
NECESSARILY TARNISH THEM OR 

2500
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,604
IMAGE. 

2501
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:30,772
TWO TALKING ABOUT IT'LL MESS UP 

2502
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:32,707
A LOT OF THINGS, TALKING TO 

2503
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:33,909
WITNESSES TALKING TO THE 

2504
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:34,176
SUBJECT. 

2505
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:35,277
AND THEN FINALLY YOU WANT 

2506
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:36,545
SOMEONE TO HAVE A FAIR TRIAL. 

2507
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,580
IF WE ARE TALKING ABILITY IT OR 

2508
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,515
PUTTING OUR FINGER ON THE 

2509
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,417
SKILL, IT WOULD BE 

2510
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,186
INAPPROPRIATE AND AGAINST WHAT 

2511
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,520
WE HAVE STAND FOR. 

2512
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,321
>>  AND THE NEGATIVE 

2513
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,724
CONSEQUENCES ON THE OUTCOME OF 

2514
01:18:49,724 --> 01:18:50,157
THE INVESTIGATION? 

2515
01:18:50,157 --> 01:18:50,825
THAT WOULD BE HUGE. 

2516
01:18:50,825 --> 01:18:52,627
THAT WOULD -- IMPACT THE 

2517
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:57,632
ABILITY TO GET A FAIR TRIAL, TO 

2518
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:58,633
CONDUCT A COMPETENT 

2519
01:18:58,633 --> 01:18:59,033
INVESTIGATION. 

2520
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:00,836
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT LAST 

2521
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:01,636
COMMENT. 

2522
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:05,841
I WOULD JUST URGE MY COLLEAGUES 

2523
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,309
THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS 

2524
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:08,810
APOPLEXY THAT SEEMS TO BE 

2525
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,844
BREAKING OUT THAT WE REMEMBER 

2526
01:19:09,844 --> 01:19:11,045
THAT WHAT WE ARE REALLY TRYING 

2527
01:19:11,045 --> 01:19:13,348
TO DO HERE IS GET TO THE TRUTH. 

2528
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:16,651
THE TRUTH THAT WE NEED TO GET 

2529
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,855
TO IS WHAT A HOSTILE FOREIGN 

2530
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:22,224
GROUP DID TO INTERFERE WITH OUR 

2531
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:22,524
DEMOCRACY. 

2532
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,926
LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE 

2533
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:25,293
MOVE FORWARD. 

2534
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,260
LET'S MAKE THAT THE FOCUS. 

2535
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,430
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

2536
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:28,930
ARE EXPECTING. 

2537
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:32,299
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE COUNTING 

2538
01:19:32,299 --> 01:19:33,501
ON US TO DO. 

2539
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:36,304
LET THIS INVESTIGATION GO 

2540
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:36,571
FORWARD. 

2541
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,104
LET'S GET TO THE TRUTH. 

2542
01:19:37,104 --> 01:19:42,911
I YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF MY 

2543
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:45,013
TIME. 

2544
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:46,114

STATEMENTS THAT YOU MADE AND 

2626
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:41,656
I'M NOT GOING TO GET IN TO THE

01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:49,063
WHAT WERE YOU NOT THINKING WHEN 

2631
01:22:49,063 --> 01:22:51,166
YOU WERE SENDING THE E-MAILS 

2632
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:52,733
AND THE STATEMENTS THAT YOU 

2633
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:54,769

AND YOU ARE IN A POSITION THAT 

2641
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,190
I'M SORRY THAT IS THE CASE. 

2642
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,193
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DRAW A 

2643
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,795
DISTINCTION, A WIDE ONE BETWEEN 

2644
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:22,296
BIAS AND POLITICAL OPINION 

2645
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:23,798
THERE IS NOT THE WIDE 

2646
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:26,768
DISTINCTION THAT YOU ARE 

2647
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,103
DRAWING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I 

2648
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:31,039
WOULD BET THE FARM THAT IF YOU 

2649
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,141
WERE SITTING NEXT TO ME AS THE 

2650
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,443
INVESTIGATING PROSECUTOR AND I

JUDGE WERE HANDLING A CASE 

2653
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:42,684
WHETHER CIVIL OR CRIMINAL, WE 

2654
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,586
WOULD BE POINTING OUT THE 

2655
01:23:45,586 --> 01:23:50,959
BIASES THAT I SEE THAT YOU HAVE 

2656
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:51,793
SHOWN HERE. 

2657
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:55,396
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR 

2658
01:23:55,396 --> 01:23:56,364
JUDGEMENT BASED ON YOUR 

2659
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,399
BACKGROUND AND YOU MAY RESPOND 

2660
01:23:58,399 --> 01:23:58,699
TO THAT. 

2661
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:00,902
>>  I -- I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,003
COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR 

2663
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:02,270
CONCERN. 

2664
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:06,774
THE FIRST THING I WOULD TELL 

2665
01:24:06,774 --> 01:24:10,478
YOU IS I -- I'M -- I'M 

2666
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:11,579
DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DID NOT 

2667
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,181
UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF REGRET 

2668
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,617
THAT I EXPRESSED FROM THE HARM 

2669
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:16,985
AND DAMAGE THAT THIS HAS CAUSED 

2670
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:17,619
TO PEOPLE I LOVE. 

2671
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:20,321
>>  I DO UNDERSTAND THAT NOW. 

2672
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:22,957
I DO BUT IT'S IN H IND SIGHT. 

2673
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,026
PEOPLE LIKE AND YOU I THAT ARE 

2674
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:26,593
HERE TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, 

2675
01:24:26,593 --> 01:24:30,899
WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF THIS 

2676
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:31,132
BEFORE. 

2677
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:31,533
>>  CONGRESSMAN. 

2678
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:31,933
WITHOUT QUESTION. 

2679
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:32,634
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY FREE WITH 

2680
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:35,036
YOU THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT 

2681
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:36,004
I REGRET LOOKING BACK. 

2682
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,605
I HOPE THAT COME ACROSS TODAY. 

2683
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:38,907
I KNOW A LARGE PORTION OF TODAY 

2684
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,108
HAS BEEN COMBATIVE IN A WAY 

2685
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:42,677
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY 

2686
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:43,644
SENSE OF REGRET AND REMORSE. 

2687
01:24:43,644 --> 01:24:46,214
I WOULD DRAW SINCE YOU BROUGHT 

2688
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:51,519
IT UP, I WOULD NOTE THAT IN 

2689
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:54,122
THAT MANUAL EVERY FBI EMPLOYEE, 

2690
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:55,156
DOJ EMPLOYEES, ARE RESTRICTED 

2691
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:57,358
BUT WITH IN THAT CATEGORY IF

01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:03,431
YOU READ THAT MANUAL SITING THE 

2693
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,633
HATCH ACT IT SAYS EXCEPT FOR 

2694
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:07,435
PROHIBITED EMPLOYEES MAY NOT 

2695
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,604
ONLY HAVE POLITICAL OPINIONS 

2696
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:11,005
BUT THEY ARE ENCOURAGED TO 

2697
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,307
EXPRESS THEM. 

2698
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,809
>>  I KNOW IT WELL. 

2699
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:16,611
>>  I DON'T DRAW ANY 

2700
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,213
DISAGREEMENT WITH YOU ABOUT 

2701
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,580
BIAS WHERE IT HAPPENS. 

2702
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,250
WHAT I DISAGREE WITH YOU AND SO 

2703
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,953
MANY PEOPLE TODAY IS THAT 

2704
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:25,820
POLITICAL BELIEF DOESN'T EQUATE 

2705
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:26,086
TO BIAS. 

2706
01:25:26,086 --> 01:25:28,556
WE HAVE TO GO TO THE EVIDENCE.  

2707
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:37,432
THIS COMMITTEE. 

2708
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:38,166
ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE 

2709
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,935
LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKS AND 

2710
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:45,640
NOT A SINGLE ACT TELLS ME THAT 

2711
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,474
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

2712
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,542
REALLY COMPETENT PEOPLE HAVE 

2713
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:49,010
LOOKED FOR IT. 

2714
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,646
BEYOND ME SAYING THAT I KNOW IT 

2715
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,079
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

2716
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:52,713
IT'S NOT JUST ME. 

2717
01:25:52,713 --> 01:25:54,248
IT'S THIS ENTIRE GROUP OF FOLKS 

2718
01:25:54,248 --> 01:25:56,284
LOOKING AT IT, OF STRUCTURE OF

01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,386
THE FBI WHO IS BUILT NOT TO DO 

2720
01:25:58,386 --> 01:25:59,887
THOSE THINGS AND NOT TO ALLOW 

2721
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:00,053
IT. 

2722
01:26:00,053 --> 01:26:03,357

2727
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:10,598
FOR YOU. 

2728
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:14,602
I WILL KEEP IT SIMPLE. 

2729
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:15,169
SOME QUESTIONS WILL BE 

2730
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:15,470
REPEATING. 

2731
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,638
IN YOUR TIME AT THE FBI HAVE 

2732
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:20,808
YOU INVESTIGATED A MEMBER OF 

2733
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:21,375
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? 

2734
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:21,943
>>  YES. 

2735
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:24,846
>>  DID ANY OF THOSE 

2736
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:28,383
INVESTIGATIONS RESULT IN AN 

2737
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:28,983
INDICTMENT? 

2738
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:29,250
>>  NO. 

2739
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,919
>>  HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED 

2740
01:26:31,919 --> 01:26:32,654
ANYONE THAT IDENTIFIED AS 

2741
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:35,690
INDEPENDENT OR UNASSOCIATED 

2742
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,124
WITH EITHER OF THE TWO MAJOR 

2743
01:26:37,124 --> 01:26:37,391
PARTIES? 

2744
01:26:37,391 --> 01:26:37,992
>>  I DON'T KNOW. 

2745
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,995
>>  YOU DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF 

2746
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:41,496
THOSE RE. 

2747
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:44,299
>>  I DON'T KNOW -- I KNOW -- 

2748
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:45,399
I'M THINKING OF THE DEMOCRATIC 

2749
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:47,502
PARTY SECRETARY CLINTON WAS 

2750
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:48,836
PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

2751
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,872
I DON'T TEND TO BEYOND THAT. 

2752
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,273
I'M NOT A PUBLIC CORRUPTION 

2753
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:53,808
AGENT AND POLITICAL ASSOCIATION 

2754
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:56,443
IS NOT SOMETHING WE LOOKED AT. 

2755
01:26:56,443 --> 01:26:58,712
>>  BUT IN YOUR ASSESSMENT 

2756
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:00,314
WOULD YOUR WORK HISTORY SUGGEST 

2757
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:03,818
A BIAS BY YOU TOWARD ANY ONE 

2758
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:04,218
PARTY? 

2759
01:27:04,218 --> 01:27:04,585
>>  NO. 

2760
01:27:04,585 --> 01:27:06,020
>>  YOU INVESTIGATED AS YOU 

2761
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,889
SAID SECRETARY CLINTON FOR USE 

2762
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:08,356
OF PRIVATE E-MAILS. 

2763
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:08,623
>>  YES. 

2764
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:10,725
>>  SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE 

2765
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:11,358
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

2766
01:27:11,358 --> 01:27:11,726
>>  YES. 

2767
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:14,362
>>  WE KNOW YOU HAVE 

2768
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,230
INVESTIGATED A REPUBLICAN 

2769
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:18,333
PROVIDED YOUR PARTICIPATION IN 

2770
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:18,933
THE ONGOING RUSSIA 

2771
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:19,300
INVESTIGATION. 

2772
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,436
WE KNOW THAT INVESTIGATION HAS 

2773
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:22,603
LED TO AN INDICTMENT. 

2774
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:24,505
IN FACT IT HAS LED TO 19 

2775
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:25,807
INDICTMENTS, FIVE GUILTY PLEAS 

2776
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,541

RUSSIAN NATIONALS AND 

2781
01:27:32,613 --> 01:27:32,913
COMPANIES. 

2782
01:27:32,913 --> 01:27:35,850
IS THIS FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU 

2783
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,719
HAVE INVESTIGATED AND INDICTED 

2784
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,120
INDIVIDUALS FROM THE POLITICAL 

2785
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:40,588
SPECTRUM? 

2786
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,456
>>  YES. 

2787
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:45,359
WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT. 

2788
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:45,692
I DON'T KNOW. 

2789
01:27:45,692 --> 01:27:47,161
IT'S A FAIR ASSUMPTION. 

2790
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:51,366

OFFICIAL BUSINESS. 

2795
01:27:59,006 --> 01:28:00,575
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A 

2796
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:01,576
REPUBLICAN. 

2797
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:01,843
CORRECT? 

2798
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:02,643
>>  YES. 

2799
01:28:02,643 --> 01:28:04,545
>>  SO THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE 

2800
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:06,748
KEY STAFFERS FOR A REPUBLICAN

>>  YES. 

2803
01:28:07,681 --> 01:28:10,385
>>  THESE INDIVIDUALS SERVE OR

NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL. 

2809
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:18,793
IT IS SAFE TO SEE YOU THAT

01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:20,495
INDIVIDUALS IN SUCH HIGH 

2811
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:21,896

>>  I WILL ANSWER THAT.

I CAN'T ANSWER THAT BASED ON IF 

2822
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:36,744
THEY WERE ONGOING. 

2823
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:37,745
IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR 

2824
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:39,647
ME TO TALK ABOUT THEM. 

2825
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,482
>>  OKAY. 

2826
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:43,217

SEVERAL OF THOSE NAMED CONTINUE 

2831
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,427
TO ADVISE THE PRESIDENT OF THE

DOLLARS. 

2835
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:59,634
ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WHEN 

2836
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:02,036
PEOPLE CALL MY OFFICE THEY ARE 

2837
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:02,836
DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, 

2838
01:29:02,836 --> 01:29:04,205
INDEPENDENTS AND THEY AREN'T 

2839
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:05,439
INVOLVED LIKE ALL OF US. 

2840
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:08,409
IF YOU ASK THEM I'M SURE THEY 

2841
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,376
WOULD SAY THEY RECEIVED TOP 

2842
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,711
NOTCH SERVICE FROM MY OFFICE 

2843
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:12,013

EVERYBODY ELSE LIKE WE HAVE 

2845
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:15,182
TALKED ABOUT. 

2846
01:29:15,182 --> 01:29:16,984
LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION 

2847
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:19,921
TODAY I HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT

01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:20,655
SOME OF MY REPUBLICAN 

2849
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:22,657
COLLEAGUES, NOT EVERYBODY BUT 

2850
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:24,625
SINCE YOU APPARENTLY THINK THAT 

2851
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,426
BIASES PREVENT PEOPLE FROM 

2852
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:27,328
DOING THEIR BEST JOB IT MAKES 

2853
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:28,930
ME WONDER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 

2854
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:29,964
DEMOCRATS CALL YOUR OFFICE. 

2855
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:33,334
DO YOU NOT GIVE THEM THE SAME 

2856
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,336

2912
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:39,820
IS THAT AN ACCURATE READING OF

01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:40,153

01:34:35,769 --> 01:34:37,004
THAT'S ACCURATE OR NOT. 

2956
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:37,371
I'M NOT AWARE. 

2957
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:39,740

01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:54,555
>>  I DO NOT. 

2968
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:56,690
>>  ALL RIGHT. 

2969
01:34:56,690 --> 01:35:01,061
I WANT TO GO BACK TO -- ONE 

2970
01:35:01,061 --> 01:35:05,166
MORE QUESTION TO ASK YOU THE 

2971
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:06,066
FIRST ROUND MR. STRZOK. 

2972
01:35:06,066 --> 01:35:09,069
MR. SIMPSON WHEN HE DID TESTIFY 

2973
01:35:09,069 --> 01:35:12,006
IN FRONT OF THE SENATE 

2974
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:12,807
COMMITTEE WAS ASKED ABOUT 

2975
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:13,140
FUSION. 

2976
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:14,942
NOBODY FROM FUSION EVER SPOKE 

2977
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:15,608
WITH THE FBI. 

2978
01:35:15,608 --> 01:35:17,211
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT GOES 

2979
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,445
AGAINST WHAT IS IN THE E-MAIL 

2980
01:35:18,445 --> 01:35:20,848
THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

2981
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:21,248
WITH YOU? 

2982
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:21,982
>>  I DON'T KNOW. 

2983
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:23,951
I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE NOT 

2984
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:25,552
SPOKEN TO MR. SIMPSON. 

2985
01:35:25,552 --> 01:35:27,054
>>  NOT SPOKEN TO HIM. 

2986
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:27,955
I DIDN'T ASK YOU THAT. 

2987
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:30,357
I ASKED YOU THAT THE FIRST 

2988
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:30,557
TIME. 

2989
01:35:30,557 --> 01:35:31,859
I THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND I 

2990
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:33,727
THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM SOUTH 

2991
01:35:33,727 --> 01:35:34,327
CAROLINA FOR YIELDING. 

2992
01:35:34,327 --> 01:35:34,961
I YIELD BACK. 

2993
01:35:34,961 --> 01:35:36,664
>>  THE CHAIR WOULD NOTE THAT 

2994
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:38,065
SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED 

2995
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:39,667
BY THE GENTLEMAN WEREN'T 

2996
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,670
ANSWERED BY THE WITNESS ON THE 

2997
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:46,140
ADVICE OF HIS COUNSEL AND I 

2998
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,208
PRESUME THROUGH THE FBI. 

2999
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:49,944
WE WILL NOTE THOSE QUESTIONS SO 

3000
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:51,545
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THEM AT A 

3001
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:53,547
FUTURE TIME BECAUSE I FIND IT 

3002
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:56,183
STUNNING THAT THEY ARE NOT 

3003
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:59,386
ALLOWING YOU TO ANSWER THEM. 

3004
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:02,123
CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE 

3005
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:04,324
GENTLEMA FROM ILLINOIS. 

3006
01:36:04,324 --> 01:36:06,360
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

3007
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,494
THE CHAIRMAN STARTED THIS 

3008
01:36:07,494 --> 01:36:11,765
HEARING BY SAYING I WISH THIS 

3009
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:12,399
HEARING WASN'T NECESSARY. 

3010
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:14,201
WELL, SORRY IF I DON'T BELIEVE 

3011
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:14,468
THAT. 

3012
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:15,703
OF COURSE HE WANTS THIS HEARING 

3013
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:16,637
IT'S NOT NECESSARY. 

3014
01:36:16,637 --> 01:36:19,473
I THINK THERE ARE HEARING THAT 

3015
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:20,974
AREN'T NECESSARY. 

3016
01:36:20,974 --> 01:36:21,842
WE SEE THEM EVERY DAY. 

3017
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:23,143
THERE ARE 3,000 CHILDREN 

3018
01:36:23,143 --> 01:36:25,045
SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOMS AND 

3019
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:26,146
DADS AND THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T 

3020
01:36:26,146 --> 01:36:29,083
KNOW WHERE THEIR MOMS AND DADS 

3021
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:30,784
ARE AND CAN'T BRING THEM 

3022
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:31,051
TOGETHER. 

3023
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:33,187
THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THE 

3024
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:34,388
COMMITTEE SHOULD BE 

3025
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:34,755
INVESTIGATING. 

3026
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:37,191
WE START A POLICY IN THIS 

3027
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:38,792
COUNTRY WHERE WE BAN, BAN 

3028
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:41,195
MUSLIMS FROM COMING IN AND WE 

3029
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:43,597
MAKE A TEST, A RELIGIOUS TEST. 

3030
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:45,599
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THE 

3031
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:46,766
COMMITTEE SHOULD TAKE UP. 

3032
01:36:46,766 --> 01:36:49,370
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE 

3033
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:50,471
UNITED STATES THAT THERE ARE 16 

3034
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,273
WOMEN WHO HAVE COME FORWARD TO 

3035
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:54,675
SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

3036
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:55,776
UNITED STATES HAS ATTACKED THEM 

3037
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:57,678
AND WHAT DOES THE COMMITTEE DO? 

3038
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:58,445
NO HEARINGS. 

3039
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:00,748
EVEN ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS 

3040
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:02,016
COMMITTEE HAD TO RESIGN BECAUSE 

3041
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:03,684
HE ASKED ONE OF HIS STAFFERS 

3042
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:05,419
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS IF SHE 

3043
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:08,088
WOULD CARRY A BABY FOR HIM. 

3044
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:09,390
DO WE HAVE ANY HEARINGS ON THE 

3045
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,993
STATE AND THE PLIGHT OF WOMEN 

3046
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:14,594
IN THE WORKPLACE IN AMERICA? 

3047
01:37:14,594 --> 01:37:14,761
NO. 

3048
01:37:14,761 --> 01:37:16,397
THESE ARE ALL THINGS AND ISSUES 

3049
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,298
THAT ARE ON THE AMERICAN 

3050
01:37:18,298 --> 01:37:18,698
PEOPLE'S MINDS. 

3051
01:37:18,698 --> 01:37:20,801
WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 

3052
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:21,635
THOSE ISSUES. 

3053
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:23,070
THOSE SHOULD BE ISSUES THAT I 

3054
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,571
BELIEVE ARE PERTINENT AND 

3055
01:37:24,571 --> 01:37:25,706
SHOULD HAVE HEARINGS BEFORE 

3056
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:26,473
THIS COMMITTEE. 

3057
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:29,376
WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HEARING IS 

3058
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:31,779
TO BRING MR. STRZOK SO THAT WE 

3059
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:33,881
CAN REPEAT AND CONTINUE TO SAY 

3060
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:37,017
THAT HE IS LYING AND THAT HE IS 

3061
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:39,920
BIASED AND SOMEONE HE CORRUPTED 

3062
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,422
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE 

3063
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:46,427
POINT THAT WE CAN'T BELIEVE 

3064
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:49,797
CAN'T BELIEVE THE NEW FBI 

3065
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:55,135
DIRECTOR OR ANYONE. 

3066
01:37:55,135 --> 01:37:57,904
AND THAT W SHOULDA SHOULD 

3067
01:37:57,904 --> 01:37:58,171
ABANDON. 

3068
01:37:58,171 --> 01:38:00,207
IF THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE THAT 

3069
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:00,874
ARE THRILLED AND EXCITED TODAY. 

3070
01:38:00,874 --> 01:38:03,510
THE FOLKS AT FOX NEWS AND THE 

3071
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,379
KREMLIN BECAUSE THEY BOTH 

3072
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,780
WORKED ON ELECTING PRESIDENT 

3073
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,281
TRUMP. 

3074
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:08,448
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

3075
01:38:08,448 --> 01:38:09,315
OF AMERICA. 

3076
01:38:09,315 --> 01:38:12,219
THEY HAVE GOT TO BE OVERJOYED 

3077
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:13,721
TODAY AT THE KREMLIN AND 

3078
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:14,621
APPLAUDING AND WATCH THE NEWS 

3079
01:38:14,621 --> 01:38:17,825
REEL TONIGHT BECAUSE A LOT OF 

3080
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:18,926
THIS TODAY IS WHAT? 

3081
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:20,527
TRYING OUT FOR FOX NEWS AND OF 

3082
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:23,897
COURSE AT THE CLAPPING AT THE 

3083
01:38:23,897 --> 01:38:24,164
KREMLIN. 

3084
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:25,566
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE A 

3085
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,234
TIME THAT THE CONGRESS OF THE 

3086
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:30,070
UNITED STATES WOULD DO THE WORK 

3087
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:33,407
OF DESTROYING BECAUSE WHAT DO 

3088
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:33,874
WE KNOW? 

3089
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,710
WE KNOW VERY CLEARLY THAT OUR 

3090
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:39,313
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 

3091
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:41,281
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAVE 

3092
01:38:41,281 --> 01:38:43,550
STATED AND THIS IS UNREFUTABLE 

3093
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:49,356
THAT THE RUSSIANS WORKED TO 

3094
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:50,724
UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY AND TO 

3095
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:51,558
ELECT DONALD TRUMP. 

3096
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:56,163
YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT 

3097
01:38:56,163 --> 01:38:56,696
MR. STRZOK. 

3098
01:38:56,696 --> 01:38:57,932
WE DO NOT INVESTIGATE THAT. 

3099
01:38:57,932 --> 01:39:02,169
HOW CAN WE HAVE SUCH AN ATTACK 

3100
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:04,104
ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE DON'T 

3101
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:04,505
INVESTIGATE? 

3102
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:05,505
I WANT TO ASK YOU MR. STRZOK. 

3103
01:39:05,505 --> 01:39:07,808
BECAUSE THEY HAVE KEPT SAYING 

3104
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:08,509
HAVE YOU THIS BIAS. 

3105
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:11,945
WHEN DID YOU LEARN AND HOW DID 

3106
01:39:11,945 --> 01:39:14,414
YOU LEARN ABOUT THE 

3107
01:39:14,414 --> 01:39:15,649
INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBLE 

3108
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:16,950
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE DONALD 

3109
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:18,952
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN 

3110
01:39:18,952 --> 01:39:21,888
INFLUENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION? 

3111
01:39:21,888 --> 01:39:28,295
>>  SIR, I'M LIMITED TO WHAT 

3112
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:28,962
DIRECTOR COMEY ISSUABLE TO SAY 

3113
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:29,963
BUT IN LATE JULY. 

3114
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:33,367
>>  WHEN DID THE PUBLIC LEARN 

3115
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:34,468
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO 

3116
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:36,236
RUSSIAN COLLUSION AND DONALD 

3117
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:36,737
TRUMP'S INVESTIGATION? 

3118
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:37,371
>>  I DON'T REMEMBER SPECIFIC 

3119
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:38,639
DATE BUT IT WAS INTO THE 

3120
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:39,006
FOLLOWING YEAR. 

3121
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:41,074
>>  IT WAS AFTER THE ELECTION. 

3122
01:39:41,074 --> 01:39:41,508
>>  YES. 

3123
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:43,944
>>  WHAT WE ARE TO BELIEVE FROM 

3124
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:45,512
OUR REPUBLICAN MAJORITY THAT 

3125
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:48,782
YOU ARE SO BIASED, YOU ARE SUCH 

3126
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:50,951
A DEMOCRAT THAT YOU CAN'T HOLD 

3127
01:39:50,951 --> 01:39:52,152
BACK FROM TRYING TO DESTROY 

3128
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:54,555
TRUMP BUT YOU NEVER TOLD ANYONE 

3129
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:56,690
THAT THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION 

3130
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,291
INTO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN 

3131
01:39:58,291 --> 01:39:59,159
AND WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS 

3132
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:00,160
SNOW NEVER TOLD ANYONE? 

3133
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:00,393
>>  NO. 

3134
01:40:00,393 --> 01:40:01,762
>>  YOU NEVER TALKED TO A 

3135
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:02,029
REPORTER? 

3136
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:02,596
>>  NEVER. 

3137
01:40:02,596 --> 01:40:05,265
>>  BUT YOU HAD IT IN YOUR 

3138
01:40:05,265 --> 01:40:05,966
HANDS. 

3139
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:06,700
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE IN 

3140
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:08,969
AMERICA IT'S YOU CAN DO ALMOST 

3141
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:09,236
ANYTHING. 

3142
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:10,838
YOU DID HAVE ALMOST A MAGICAL 

3143
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,872
BULLET IN YOUR HANDS TO DERAIL 

3144
01:40:12,872 --> 01:40:13,941
THE DONALD TRUMP INVESTIGATION 

3145
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:15,308
AND DID YOU USE IT? 

3146
01:40:15,308 --> 01:40:18,445
>>  NO SIR. 

3147
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:19,546
>>  YOU DIDN'T. 

3148
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:19,779
RIGHT? 

3149
01:40:19,779 --> 01:40:20,747
ARE THERE REPUBLICANS AT WORK 

3150
01:40:20,747 --> 01:40:21,114
AT THE FBI? 

3151
01:40:21,114 --> 01:40:23,884
IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE ARE YOU 

3152
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:24,251
ALL DEMOCRATS. 

3153
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:26,319
I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE. 

3154
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:27,554
ARE THERE REPUBLICANS IN. 

3155
01:40:27,554 --> 01:40:27,955
>>  YES. 

3156
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:31,792
>>  SINCE YOU LIKE TO CHERRY 

3157
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:33,861
PICK THE DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE 

3158
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,663
GIVEN MONEY, THE FBI AGENTS 

3159
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:38,465
THAT GIVE MONEY WHY NOT REVEAL 

3160
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:39,766
THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE 

3161
01:40:39,766 --> 01:40:41,401
FBI THAT GIVE MONEY TO 

3162
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:43,470
REPUBLICANS IN WHY NOT REVEAL 

3163
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,372
THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE 

3164
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:47,641
FBI THAT ARE IN AND STATE VERY 

3165
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:50,544
CLEARLY WHEN THEY APPLY FOR A 

3166
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:52,546
VOTER REGISTRATION THEY APPLY 

3167
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:52,946
AS REPUBLICANS. 

3168
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:53,246
THEY DON'T. 

3169
01:40:53,246 --> 01:40:54,548
BECAUSE THAT'S 23409 WHAT THIS 

3170
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:55,015
IS ABOUT. 

3171
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:57,884
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS FOR THE 

3172
01:40:57,884 --> 01:40:59,186
AMERICAN PUBLIC MR. STRZOK, 

3173
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:00,287
REALLY NOT ABOUT YOU. 

3174
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:05,993
THEY WANT TO DAMAGE AND DESTROY 

3175
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,794
OUR DEMOCR ACY AND ONE WAY IS 

3176
01:41:07,794 --> 01:41:14,902
BY DESTROYING THE FBI AND 

3177
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:15,602
THAT'S  REGRETTABLE. 

3178
01:41:15,602 --> 01:41:16,436
THE KREMLIN WON THE ELECTION 

3179
01:41:16,436 --> 01:41:20,173
AND NOW THEY WANT TO DESTROY 

3180
01:41:20,173 --> 01:41:20,807
THE INSTITUTIONS. 

3181
01:41:20,807 --> 01:41:21,208
CONGRATULATIONS. 

3182
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:21,909
AND CONGRATULATIONS TO 

3183
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,278
EVERYBODY THAT IS HELPING THEM. 

3184
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:26,612
>>  GENTLEMAN FROM ILLINOIS 

3185
01:41:26,612 --> 01:41:27,614
YIELDS BACK. 

3186
01:41:27,614 --> 01:41:28,782
THE GENTLEMAN FROM TENNESSEE. 

3187
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:29,182
>>  THANK YOU. 

3188
01:41:29,182 --> 01:41:30,417
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF 

3189
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:31,418
QUESTIONS FOR YOU MR. STRZOK 

3190
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:34,021
AND I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD THE 

3191
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:36,290
BALANCE OF MY TIME TO THE 

3192
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:36,556
CHAIRMAN. 

3193
01:41:36,556 --> 01:41:37,791
IN LIGHT OF THE LAST ROUND OF 

3194
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,526
QUESTIONING, IT'S FAIR TO SAY 

3195
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:45,199
THAT YOU WANTED TO STOP 

3196
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:46,500
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM  BEING 

3197
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:46,767
ELECTED? 

3198
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:47,000
>>  NO. 

3199
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,502
THAT WAS THAT I HAD A 

3200
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:49,870
PREFERENCE FOR HIM TO NOT BE 

3201
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:50,871
PRESIDENT BUT I DIDN'T AND 

3202
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:51,171
WOULDN'T. 

3203
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:52,773
>>  DID I NOT HEAR YOU READ 

3204
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:54,141
YOUR OWN TEXTS THAT YOU WOULD 

3205
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:55,108
STOP HIM? 

3206
01:41:55,108 --> 01:41:56,176
YOU WOULD STOP IT? 

3207
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:56,843
>>  NO. 

3208
01:41:56,843 --> 01:41:57,677
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD OR MISHEARD 

3209
01:41:57,677 --> 01:41:57,978
ME. 

3210
01:41:57,978 --> 01:42:00,280
I SAID THAT MY SENSE OF NOT 

3211
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,882
RECALLING WRITING THAT TEXT WAS 

3212
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:05,619
THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 

3213
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:06,052
WOULDN'TELECT HIM. 

3214
01:42:06,052 --> 01:42:10,457
>>  YOU DIDN'T LIKE DONALD 

3215
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:10,724
TRUMP? 

3216
01:42:10,724 --> 01:42:11,992
ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD 

3217
01:42:11,992 --> 01:42:14,094
HAVE LED THIS INVESTIGATION? 

3218
01:42:14,094 --> 01:42:16,997
>>  IT WAS LOGICAL GIVEN I WAS 

3219
01:42:16,997 --> 01:42:18,298
THE NUMBER TWO IN COUNTER 

3220
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:20,934
INTELLIGENCE BUT NO, THERE ARE 

3221
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:22,302
QUALIFIED FOLKS IN THE FBI. 

3222
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:22,802
DADA, NOT THAT MANY. 

3223
01:42:22,802 --> 01:42:24,871
>>  LOOKING BACK THEN SHOULD 

3224
01:42:24,871 --> 01:42:26,139
YOU HAVE RECUSED YOURSELF IN? 

3225
01:42:26,139 --> 01:42:26,673
>>  ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

3226
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:28,075
>>  YOU DON'T LIKE THIS MAN. 

3227
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:30,710
YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE 

3228
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,278
PRESIDENT. 

3229
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:43,423
YOU HAD SEVERAL VERYD ISP  BAD 

3230
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:43,656
TEXTS. 

3231
01:42:43,656 --> 01:42:45,926
>>  THERE WERE TIMES I DIDN'T 

3232
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:48,294
CARE FOR CLINTON AND I 

3233
01:42:48,294 --> 01:42:48,728
INVESTIGATED THAT. 

3234
01:42:48,728 --> 01:42:50,731
>>  THAT'S THE ONE THING I HAVE 

3235
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:52,132
STRUGGLED WITH HERE TODAY 

3236
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:53,133
LISTENING TO YOUR TESTIMONY. 

3237
01:42:53,133 --> 01:42:54,500
I THINK A MAN IN YOUR POSITION 

3238
01:42:54,500 --> 01:43:00,274
AND POWER AND THE RESPECT THAT 

3239
01:43:00,274 --> 01:43:01,608
YOU SHOULD HAVE -- THAT YOU 

3240
01:43:01,608 --> 01:43:02,909
WOULD HAVE STOPPED TO THINK 

3241
01:43:02,909 --> 01:43:04,611
MAYBE THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT 

3242
01:43:04,611 --> 01:43:06,713
COULD DO A BETTER JOB WITHOUT 

3243
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:07,614
SUCH DISDAIN FOR THE PRESIDENT. 

3244
01:43:07,614 --> 01:43:10,250
YOU CLAIM TO BE SUCH A PATRIOT 

3245
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,918
BUT YOU CONTINUED TO DO IT 

3246
01:43:11,918 --> 01:43:18,025
AFTER HE WAS ELECTED. 

3247
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:21,794
>>  AGENT STRZOK I'M CONFUSED. 

3248
01:43:21,794 --> 01:43:24,131
I THOUGHT ON THAT AUGUST 8TH 

3249
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:26,433
TEXT YOU THAT DIDN'T RECALL 

3250
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:26,799
TYPING IT. 

3251
01:43:26,799 --> 01:43:28,635
THEN YOU SAID THAT YOU RECALLED 

3252
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:30,804
IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT AND THAT 

3253
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:33,106
MITIGATED THE CONTENT OF WHAT 

3254
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:33,439
YOU TYPED. 

3255
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:34,708
DO YOU RECALL IT OR WAS IT LATE 

3256
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,310
AT NIGHT AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU 

3257
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,344
RECALL ABOUT THE TIMING OF 

3258
01:43:38,344 --> 01:43:38,545
THAT? 

3259
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:39,813
>>  I THINK BY RECOLLECTION OF 

3260
01:43:39,813 --> 01:43:41,114
STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT 

3261
01:43:41,114 --> 01:43:42,682
ACROSS THE BOARD. 

3262
01:43:42,682 --> 01:43:43,883
I DON'T REMEMBER TYPING IT. 

3263
01:43:43,883 --> 01:43:44,884
IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT. 

3264
01:43:44,884 --> 01:43:47,921
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT ITS WAS 

3265
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:48,121
NOT. 

3266
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:50,624
IT WASN'T A SUGGESTION THAT I 

3267
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:53,259
OR THE FBI TAKE ANY ACTION. 

3268
01:43:53,259 --> 01:43:55,228
>>  INSTEAD OF US MUSEUMIG 

3269
01:43:55,228 --> 01:43:58,332
ABOUT WHAT YOU MEANT, LET'S GO 

3270
01:43:58,332 --> 01:43:59,032
WITH WHAT YOU SAID. 

3271
01:43:59,032 --> 01:44:00,968
>>  I WOULD RATHER YOU GO WITH 

3272
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:01,435
WHAT I DID. 

3273
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:03,537
THAT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY 

3274
01:44:03,537 --> 01:44:03,804
THAT IS. 

3275
01:44:03,804 --> 01:44:09,343
>>  WE WILL GET TO THAT IN A 

3276
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:09,976
SECOND. 

3277
01:44:09,976 --> 01:44:10,811
I PROMISE YOU. 

3278
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:11,611
NO HE IS NOT. 

3279
01:44:11,611 --> 01:44:13,112
WE WILL STOP IT. 

3280
01:44:13,112 --> 01:44:17,651
I THINK YOU HAVE AGREED THAT IT 

3281
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:18,718
WAS HIS ELECTION? 

3282
01:44:18,718 --> 01:44:22,556
>>  I DIDN'T THINK, NOT 

3283
01:44:22,556 --> 01:44:23,256
RECALLING WRITING IT. 

3284
01:44:23,256 --> 01:44:23,957
HIS ELECTION, CANDIDACY. 

3285
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:24,724
I DON'T RECALL WRITING IT. 

3286
01:44:24,724 --> 01:44:25,892
I. NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANT. 

3287
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:28,762
>>  WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY STOP? 

3288
01:44:28,762 --> 01:44:29,629
>>  STOP IT. 

3289
01:44:29,629 --> 01:44:30,664
MY SENSE, LOOKING AT THE 

3290
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:32,332
CONTEXT WAS THAT THERE WAS NO 

3291
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:34,568
WAY COMING OFF THE HEELS OF 

3292
01:44:34,568 --> 01:44:35,869
INSULTING THE FAMILY THAT THE 

3293
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:36,837
AMERICAN AND ALL THE OTHER 

3294
01:44:36,837 --> 01:44:39,239
STATEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE 

3295
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:41,408
IN THE COMPARISON OF SIZE 

3296
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:42,509
DURING A DEBATE AND -- THAT 

3297
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:43,910
THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THE 

3298
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,112
AMERICAN POPULATION WAS GOING 

3299
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,346
TO ELECT THIS MAN. 

3300
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:48,682
MY SENSE WAS THIS IS A OFF THE 

3301
01:44:48,682 --> 01:44:49,950
CUFF, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT SORT 

3302
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:50,416
OF COMMENT. 

3303
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:51,752
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT DAY 

3304
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:54,655
WHEN I SENT A TEXT SAYING WHAT 

3305
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:55,455
WAS THAT? 

3306
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:56,089
ITS CLEAR THERE IS NO 

3307
01:44:56,089 --> 01:44:57,557
CONSPIRACY, THERE IS NO MEETING 

3308
01:44:57,557 --> 01:45:00,093
OF THE MINDS, NO SUGGESTION OF 

3309
01:45:00,093 --> 01:45:01,862
ACTIONS, IT WAS MERELY A ONE 

3310
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:02,195
OFF COMMENT. 

3311
01:45:02,195 --> 01:45:03,663
>>  AND OF COURSE IT'S ABOUT A 

3312
01:45:03,663 --> 01:45:06,366
WEEK BEFORE YOU USE THE WORD WE 

3313
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:07,567
AGAIN IN CONNECTION WITH AN 

3314
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:09,970
INSURANCE POLICY TO MAKE SURE 

3315
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,804
HE WAS NOT ELECTED PRESIDENT 

3316
01:45:11,804 --> 01:45:20,413
AND THEN WE GET TO THE DAY THE 

3317
01:45:20,413 --> 01:45:21,081
SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS APPOINTED. 

3318
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:27,753
WHO GIVES A F, ONE MORE AD. 

3319
01:45:27,753 --> 01:45:30,190
INVESTIGATION LEADING TO 

3320
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:34,828
IMPEACHMENT WITH A QUESTION  

3321
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:41,234
MARK WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 

3322
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:42,802
THAT THE DAY OF HIS APPOINT 

3323
01:45:42,802 --> 01:45:43,169
NEXT. 

3324
01:45:43,169 --> 01:45:45,872
YOU COULD HAVE SAID AN 

3325
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:47,040
INVESTIGATION LEADING TO 

3326
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,842
INDICTMENTS AGAINST RUSSIANS, 

3327
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:51,445
AN INVESTIGATION LEADING TO 

3328
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:53,346
BETTER ELECTION SECURITY, AN 

3329
01:45:53,346 --> 01:45:54,448
INVESTIGATION LEADING INTO A 

3330
01:45:54,448 --> 01:45:56,183
ROBUST RESPONSE TO WHAT RUSSIA 

3331
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:58,885
TRIED TO DO TO OUR COUNTRY BUT 

3332
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:01,288
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT. 

3333
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:02,689
YOU WENT STRAIGHT TO 

3334
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:03,022
IMPEACHMENT. 

3335
01:46:03,022 --> 01:46:04,624
DO YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS? 

3336
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:07,394
>>  I HAVE A GENERAL 

3337
01:46:07,394 --> 01:46:07,928
UNDERSTANDING. 

3338
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:08,762
>>  HOW? 

3339
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:09,996
>>  SIR, MY UNDERSTANDING IS 

3340
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:12,199
LIMITED TO THAT ITS SOMETHING 

3341
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:17,336
DONE BY THE CONGRESS. 

3342
01:46:17,336 --> 01:46:17,971
THAT THERE ARTICLES OF 

3343
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:18,304
IMPEACHMENT. 

3344
01:46:18,304 --> 01:46:20,173
>>  DO YOU HAVE TO BE A SITTING 

3345
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:21,574
OFFICE HOLDER TO BE IMPEACHED? 

3346
01:46:21,574 --> 01:46:25,378
>>  I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. 

3347
01:46:25,378 --> 01:46:26,646
>>  I ACTUALLY DO AND I WILL 

3348
01:46:26,646 --> 01:46:28,148
TAKE NOTE YOU THAT NEVER USE 

3349
01:46:28,148 --> 01:46:30,684
THE WORD IN CONNECTION WITH 

3350
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:31,484
SECRETARY CLINTON DID YOU? 

3351
01:46:31,484 --> 01:46:33,687
>>  SIR I -- I DID NOT. 

3352
01:46:33,687 --> 01:46:33,854
NO. 

3353
01:46:33,854 --> 01:46:35,154
>>  YOU DIDN'T. 

3354
01:46:35,154 --> 01:46:37,857
IF YOU DID WE DON'T HAVE IT. 

3355
01:46:37,857 --> 01:46:39,693
THAT IS AN INVESTIGATION WHERE 

3356
01:46:39,693 --> 01:46:41,895
YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT 

3357
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:46,800
MENTIONING IT BUT THE DAY THE 

3358
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,602
AD WAS APPOINTED, RATHER THAN 

3359
01:46:48,602 --> 01:46:49,869
PUNISHING RUSSIA OR INDICTING 

3360
01:46:49,869 --> 01:46:53,240
RUSSIANS OR DOING SOMETHING 

3361
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:56,376
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU WENT 

3362
01:46:56,376 --> 01:46:57,009
STRAIGHT TO IMPEACHMENT. 

3363
01:46:57,009 --> 01:46:57,309
>>  WRONG. 

3364
01:46:57,309 --> 01:46:57,978
THAT'S NOT CORRECT SIR. 

3365
01:46:57,978 --> 01:46:59,746
>>  I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. 

3366
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:00,380
>>  THE TIME. 

3367
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:23,470
>>  I'M OUT OF TIME AND WE

>>> IS THE WITNESS NOT 

3371
01:47:25,505 --> 01:47:26,639
PERMITTED TO ANSWER THE 

3372
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,709
QUESTION? 

3373
01:47:29,709 --> 01:47:31,211
>> I'M GOING TO OBJECT TO YOU 

3374
01:47:31,211 --> 01:47:32,112
NOT PERMITTING THE WITNESS TO 

3375
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:33,213
ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU 

3376
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:33,513
ASKED HIM. 

3377
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:35,482
>>> I WILL FIND OUT WHO IS 

3378
01:47:35,482 --> 01:47:35,715
NEXT. 

3379
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:43,123
THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION. 

3380
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:44,724
>> SIR, YOU ASKED IF I WENT 

3381
01:47:44,724 --> 01:47:45,358
DIRECTLY TO IMPEACHMENT RATHER 

3382
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:45,859
THAN RUSSIA. 

3383
01:47:45,859 --> 01:47:47,593
I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE 

3384
01:47:47,593 --> 01:47:52,899
QUESTION. 

3385
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:54,834
-- AS LONG AS YOU RESPOND TO 

3386
01:47:54,834 --> 01:47:56,536
THE QUESTION. 

3387
01:47:56,536 --> 01:47:57,304
MY IMMEDIATE CONCERN WAS HAVING 

3388
01:47:57,304 --> 01:48:06,246
ABSOLUTELY TO DO WITH RUSSIA 

3389
01:48:06,246 --> 01:48:07,314
AND EVERYTHING RELATED TO THAT. 

3390
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:08,582
MY CONCERN WAS WHAT RUSSIA WAS 

3391
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:09,783
DOING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHAT 

3392
01:48:09,783 --> 01:48:11,051
THE OFFICERS WERE DOING IN THE 

3393
01:48:11,051 --> 01:48:11,952
UNITED STATES AND WHAT THE 

3394
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:13,019
GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA MIGHT OR 

3395
01:48:13,019 --> 01:48:14,186
MIGHT NOT BE DOING WITH MEMBERS 

3396
01:48:14,186 --> 01:48:15,221
OF THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 

3397
01:48:15,221 --> 01:48:16,522
THAT WAS MY RESPONSE. 

3398
01:48:16,522 --> 01:48:25,565
>> THAT IS WONDERFUL. 

3399
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:26,867
TRUST ME THAT IT WOULD HAVE 

3400
01:48:26,867 --> 01:48:27,601
BEEN A LONGER TEXT. 

3401
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:28,435
I GET THAT. 

3402
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,503
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LOT 

3403
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:30,604
LONGER FOR YOU TO TYPE THAT. 

3404
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:31,338
YOU DID NOT. 

3405
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:32,138
>>> REGULAR ORDER. 

3406
01:48:32,138 --> 01:48:33,072
>> ARE YOU GOING TO PONTIFICATE 

3407
01:48:33,072 --> 01:48:33,339
NONSTOP? 

3408
01:48:33,339 --> 01:48:33,706
>> RECOGNIZED. 

3409
01:48:33,706 --> 01:48:37,143

AT ONE POINT, YOU DESCRIBED HOW 

3420
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:00,599
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S 

3421
01:49:00,599 --> 01:49:03,269
INVESTIGATION HAD AND I QUOTE, 

3422
01:49:03,269 --> 01:49:09,809
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION THAT THE 

3423
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:10,910
GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA HAD 

3424
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:11,711
OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO ELEMENTS

ON THE ELECTION. 

3427
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:21,688
IS THAT CORRECT? 

3428
01:49:21,688 --> 01:49:22,455
>> I BELIEVE SO.

I DO NOT HAVE A COPY OF THE

STATING, AND I QUOTE, THERE WAS 

3434
01:49:28,528 --> 01:49:29,562
EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA WAS TRYING 

3435
01:49:29,562 --> 01:49:31,431
TO DO IT. 

3436
01:49:31,431 --> 01:49:33,934
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THE OTHER

3438
01:49:37,837 --> 01:49:38,672

3448
01:49:56,156 --> 01:49:56,990
TRANSCRIPT, SIR, THAT YOU 

3449
01:49:56,990 --> 01:50:00,060
INTERPRETED HIS QUESTION AS 

3450
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,928
QUOTE, WHETHER OR NOT THERE 

3451
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:02,963
WERE ANY RECIPROCATION OF THAT 

3452
01:50:02,963 --> 01:50:06,800
BY MEMBERS  OF THE DONALD TRUMP 

3453
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,434
TEAM IN OFFERING THEIR 

3454
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:14,841
ASSISTANCE BACK TO RUSSIA. 

3455
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:15,709
YOU LATER CONTINUE TO EXPLAIN 

3456
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:17,877
AND I'M QUOTING FROM YOUR 

3457
01:50:17,877 --> 01:50:21,314
TRANSCRIPT, AS WHETHER OR NOT 

3458
01:50:21,314 --> 01:50:21,914
THERE WAS INFORMATION ABOUT 

3459
01:50:21,914 --> 01:50:23,617
WHETHER ELEMENTS OF THE TRUMP 

3460
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:24,517
CAMPAIGN WERE  THEMSELVES 

3461
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:25,919
ENGAGING IN THAT I CAN'T ANSWER 

3462
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:31,324
THAT IN AN UNCLASSIFIED SETTING 

3463
01:50:31,324 --> 01:50:32,192
AND FURTHERMORE I DON'T THINK 

3464
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,226
THE FBI OR SPECIAL COUNSEL 

3465
01:50:33,226 --> 01:50:35,962
WOULD WANT ME COMMENTING ON 

3466
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:36,796
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. 

3467
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:42,535
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE 

3468
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:43,670
QUESTION OF WHETHER THE TRUMP 

3469
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:44,571
CAMPAIGN WAS TRYING TO COLLUDE 

3470
01:50:44,571 --> 01:50:45,772
WITH RUSSIA  CALLS FOR A 

3471
01:50:45,772 --> 01:50:46,940
CLASSIFIED RESPONSE AND THE 

3472
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:49,109
RESPONSE THAT WOULD INVOLVE 

3473
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:54,013
INFORMATION THAT'S PART OF AN 

3474
01:50:54,013 --> 01:50:54,614
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 

3475
01:50:54,614 --> 01:50:55,081
IS THAT RIGHT? 

3476
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:55,781
>> YES. 

3477
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:57,917
>> THANK YOU. 

3478
01:50:57,917 --> 01:51:01,321
I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT YOU 

3479
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:05,925
TO REVEAL ANY CLASSIFIED OR 

3480
01:51:05,925 --> 01:51:09,528
SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIVE 

3481
01:51:09,528 --> 01:51:10,497
INFORMATION IN THIS SETTING. 

3482
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:11,398
WE HAVE REPEATEDLY GONE BACK 

3483
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:12,565
AND FORTH WITH THAT, AND I 

3484
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:14,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE TO 

3485
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,968
REPEAT THINGS REPEATEDLY TO 

3486
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:15,802
SUCH AN INTELLIGENT GROUP OF 

3487
01:51:15,802 --> 01:51:16,770
PEOPLE. 

3488
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:20,006
BACK IN MARCH, CHAIRMAN GOWDY 

3489
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:21,341
STATED ON NATIONAL TV AND I 

3490
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:23,910
QUOTE, AND IF YOU BELIEVE AS WE 

3491
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:27,647
HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS NO 

3492
01:51:27,647 --> 01:51:28,715
EVIDENCE TO COLLUSION, YOU 

3493
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:30,717
SHOULD WANT SPECIAL COUNSEL 

3494
01:51:30,717 --> 01:51:32,485
MUELLER TO TAKE ALL THE TIME 

3495
01:51:32,485 --> 01:51:34,254
AND HAVE ALL THE INDEPENDENCE 

3496
01:51:34,254 --> 01:51:44,264
HE NEEDS TO DO HIS JOB. 

3497
01:51:44,264 --> 01:51:45,231
CHAIRMAN GOWDY ALSO STATED AND 

3498
01:51:45,231 --> 01:51:46,265
I QUOTE, WHEN YOU'RE INNOCENT 

3499
01:51:46,265 --> 01:51:47,200
AND THE ALLEGATIONS OF 

3500
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,934
COLLISIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS, 

3501
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:49,302
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. 

3502
01:51:49,302 --> 01:51:50,570
YOU ARE NOT INNOCENT OF THAT. 

3503
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:51,738
ACT LIKE IT. 

3504
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:58,611
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 

3505
01:51:58,611 --> 01:51:59,946
ALLIES WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT 

3506
01:51:59,946 --> 01:52:00,947
THERE IS NO COLLUSION WITH 

3507
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:02,081
RUSSIA, AND THAT IS WHAT THIS 

3508
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:03,416
IS ABOUT, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT 

3509
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:04,217
THEY TAKE CHAIRMAN GOWDY'S 

3510
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:05,518
RECOMMENDATION AND BEGIN ACTING 

3511
01:52:05,518 --> 01:52:14,594
LIKE IT. 

3512
01:52:14,594 --> 01:52:15,728
AND I YIELD BACK MY TIME. 

3513
01:52:15,728 --> 01:52:16,529
>> SHE YIELDS BACK. 

3514
01:52:16,529 --> 01:52:17,530
AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. 

3515
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,331
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

3516
01:52:18,331 --> 01:52:21,935
IN YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY 

3517
01:52:21,935 --> 01:52:27,440
TODAY, YOU STATED THAT QUOTE, 

3518
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,908
NOT ONCE DID MY PERSONAL BIAS 

3519
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:29,542
INTERFERE WITH MY JUDGMENT. 

3520
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:31,010
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF BIAS IN 

3521
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:31,711
MY PROFESSIONAL ACTION CLOSE 

3522
01:52:31,711 --> 01:52:32,111
QUOTE. 

3523
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:32,846
LET'S EXPLORE THAT STATEMENT 

3524
01:52:32,846 --> 01:52:34,447
FOR A SECOND CAN YOU PLEASE 

3525
01:52:34,447 --> 01:52:36,249
DIVINE BECAUSE I AM -- DEFINE, 

3526
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:37,450
BECAUSE I AM REALLY CONFUSED, 

3527
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:38,451
WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF 

3528
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:38,651
BIAS? 

3529
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:39,719
MAKE IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT 

3530
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:41,087
OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

3531
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:42,288
IN REGARD TO POLITICAL OPINION. 

3532
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:43,122
THAT IS ALLOWING YOUR BELIEFS 

3533
01:52:43,122 --> 01:52:47,193
TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE HONEST 

3534
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:48,061
INDEPENDENT PURSUIT OF FACTS. 

3535
01:52:48,061 --> 01:52:49,295
>> ALLOWING YOUR OWN BELIEFS TO 

3536
01:52:49,295 --> 01:52:57,403
GET IN THE WAY OF YOUR ACTIONS. 

3537
01:52:57,403 --> 01:52:57,937
>> RIGHT. 

3538
01:52:57,937 --> 01:52:58,638
OF YOUR HONEST -- 

3539
01:52:58,638 --> 01:52:59,973
>> PLEASE GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF 

3540
01:52:59,973 --> 01:53:01,541
A SITUATION WHEN BUYERS WOULD 

3541
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:02,108
INTERFERE WITH YOUR ASPECT, 

3542
01:53:02,108 --> 01:53:02,908
YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. 

3543
01:53:02,908 --> 01:53:06,946
>> IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER 

3544
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:07,279
HYPOTHETICAL. 

3545
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:08,615
I AM NOT GOING TO INTERVIEW A 

3546
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:08,915
WITNESS. 

3547
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:09,782
I'M GOING TO DESTROY EVIDENCE. 

3548
01:53:09,782 --> 01:53:11,283
I'M GOING TO PREVENT SOMEBODY 

3549
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:15,321
FROM TAKING INVESTIGATIVE STEP. 

3550
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:16,723
I AM NOT -- IT IS DIFFICULT. 

3551
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:18,158
>> HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME 

3552
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:30,937
WHEN YOUR PROFESSIONAL ACTIONS 

3553
01:53:30,937 --> 01:53:31,838
OR YOU BELIEVED THAT YOU HAD 

3554
01:53:31,838 --> 01:53:32,138
BIAS? 

3555
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:33,940
THAT YOU NEEDED TO MOVE ON FROM 

3556
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:34,540
AN INVESTIGATION AT ANY TIME? 

3557
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:34,908
>> NO. 

3558
01:53:34,908 --> 01:53:35,308
>> NO. 

3559
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:36,709
HAS THERE BEEN A TIME IN YOUR 

3560
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:37,744
CAREER THAT YOU HAVE RECUSED 

3561
01:53:37,744 --> 01:53:38,577
YOURSELF FROM A PROFESSIONAL 

3562
01:53:38,577 --> 01:53:39,045
ACTION? 

3563
01:53:39,045 --> 01:53:39,278
>> NO. 

3564
01:53:39,278 --> 01:53:39,578
>> OKAY. 

3565
01:53:39,578 --> 01:53:40,780
YOU WILL BE SURPRISED WHAT I 

3566
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:41,814
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE 

3567
01:53:41,814 --> 01:53:43,016
RUSSIANS TRIED TO DESTABILIZE 

3568
01:53:43,016 --> 01:53:49,756
OUR ECONOMY. 

3569
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:50,556
OUR WAY OF LIFE, OUR 

3570
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:50,856
GOVERNMENT. 

3571
01:53:50,856 --> 01:53:51,958
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 

3572
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:53,393
DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME. 

3573
01:53:53,393 --> 01:53:54,827
I AM CURIOUS IF THIS IS THE 

3574
01:53:54,827 --> 01:53:56,029
FIRST TIME THAT RUSSIA TRIED TO 

3575
01:53:56,029 --> 01:53:56,696
INTERFERE WITH AN AMERICAN 

3576
01:53:56,696 --> 01:53:56,963
ELECTION. 

3577
01:53:56,963 --> 01:54:04,437
>> I AM AWARE OF TIMES WHERE 

3578
01:54:04,437 --> 01:54:06,105
THEY -- GOING BACK TO THE 1960S 

3579
01:54:06,105 --> 01:54:06,773
AND THE 1970S, WHERE THEY 

3580
01:54:06,773 --> 01:54:07,240
PLANTED EVIDENCE. 

3581
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,241
THEY WERE SEEKING TO INTRODUCE 

3582
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:09,242
ITEMS OF INFORMATION THAT WERE 

3583
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:09,842
FALSE IN NEWSPAPERS. 

3584
01:54:09,842 --> 01:54:11,311
I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DIRECT 

3585
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:13,012
OUTREACH TO MEMBERS OF A 

3586
01:54:13,012 --> 01:54:29,662
PRESIDENTIAL, EITHER CANDIDATE 

3587
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:30,396
OR HIS IMMEDIATE TEAM. 

3588
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:31,431
>> DID THEY ATTEMPT TO 

3589
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:32,231
INTERFERE IN THE 2012 

3590
01:54:32,231 --> 01:54:32,598
ELECTIONS? 

3591
01:54:32,598 --> 01:54:33,833
>> I AM CERTAIN THAT THEY DID. 

3592
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:34,133
YES. 

3593
01:54:34,133 --> 01:54:35,234
>> DO YOU REMEMBER PRESIDENT 

3594
01:54:35,234 --> 01:54:35,969
OBAMA TELLING THE RUSSIAN 

3595
01:54:35,969 --> 01:54:36,869
PRESIDENT THAT HE WOULD HAVE 

3596
01:54:36,869 --> 01:54:38,004
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO NEGOTIATE 

3597
01:54:38,004 --> 01:54:51,117
ON THE ISSUES LIKE ADMISSION 

3598
01:54:51,117 --> 01:54:52,018
THE DEFENSE AFTER THE 2012 

3599
01:54:52,018 --> 01:54:52,318
ELECTION? 

3600
01:54:52,318 --> 01:54:53,219
NO I DO NOT REMEMBER. 

3601
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:54,654
>> HE SAID THAT IN A HOT 

3602
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:54,954
MICROPHONE. 

3603
01:54:54,954 --> 01:54:55,822
WHY WAS THAT NOT INVESTIGATED? 

3604
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:57,090
>> SIR, BECAUSE THERE WERE NO 

3605
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:57,823
ALLEGATIONS TO MY KNOWLEDGE. 

3606
01:54:57,823 --> 01:54:59,225
AGAIN, I WAS NOT IN THE 

3607
01:54:59,225 --> 01:54:59,492
POSITION. 

3608
01:54:59,492 --> 01:55:00,493
>>> THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF 

3609
01:55:00,493 --> 01:55:01,794
THE UNITED STATES TELLING THE 

3610
01:55:01,794 --> 01:55:02,494
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT THAT HE WOULD 

3611
01:55:02,494 --> 01:55:03,496
HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND HE 

3612
01:55:03,496 --> 01:55:06,933
WOULD DO CERTAIN THINGS -- DO 

3613
01:55:06,933 --> 01:55:07,934
YOU RECALL DURING THE DEBATES 

3614
01:55:07,934 --> 01:55:08,668
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA OBJECTED 

3615
01:55:08,668 --> 01:55:09,969
IT TO CANDIDATE ROMNEY THAT THE 

3616
01:55:09,969 --> 01:55:11,270
1980S ARE NOW CALLING TO ASK 

3617
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:11,904
FOR THEIR FOREIGN-POLICY BOOK, 

3618
01:55:11,904 --> 01:55:12,839
THE COLD WAR IS OVER. 

3619
01:55:12,839 --> 01:55:13,606
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? 

3620
01:55:13,606 --> 01:55:14,640
>> I DO NOT. 

3621
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,042
>> SO YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 

3622
01:55:16,042 --> 01:55:16,742
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE WITH THE 

3623
01:55:16,742 --> 01:55:17,877
ELECTIONS IN 2012, BUT YOU ARE 

3624
01:55:17,877 --> 01:55:18,544
INTERESTED IN RUSSIAN 

3625
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:19,112
INTERFERENCE IN 2016. 

3626
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:20,313
YOU WERE NOT INTERESTED IN AND 

3627
01:55:20,313 --> 01:55:21,414
THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT 

3628
01:55:21,414 --> 01:55:24,050
THAT WAS SAYING THAT RUSSIA WAS 

3629
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:31,524
NO LONGER FOREIGN POWER THAT WE 

3630
01:55:31,524 --> 01:55:32,625
NEEDED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. 

3631
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:33,760
>> SIR, I DISAGREE WITH THAT 

3632
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,060
STATEMENT. 

3633
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:35,595
>> YOU DO NOT EVEN RECALL THOSE 

3634
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:36,796
STATEMENTS SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW 

3635
01:55:36,796 --> 01:55:51,110
YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH THEM. 

3636
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:52,011
BACK YOU ARE CHARACTERIZING MY 

3637
01:55:52,011 --> 01:55:53,012
INTEREST INTERFERE THAT I CAN 

3638
01:55:53,012 --> 01:55:54,347
RESPOND TO THAT IF YOU LIKE. 

3639
01:55:54,347 --> 01:55:55,448
>> HOW CAN YOU ASSURE THE 

3640
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:56,616
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE 

3641
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:57,150
NOT LYING TODAY? 

3642
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:58,751
>> ONE, AS I SAID BEFORE, I AM 

3643
01:55:58,751 --> 01:55:59,652
DOING IT UNDER OATH. 

3644
01:55:59,652 --> 01:56:00,753
I'M TELLING YOU HAVING SPENT 26 

3645
01:56:00,753 --> 01:56:01,988
YEARS, PUTTING ON A GUN AND 

3646
01:56:01,988 --> 01:56:03,256
PUTTING MY LIFE AT RISK FOR 

3647
01:56:03,256 --> 01:56:04,824
THIS COUNTRY, I AM NOT LYING TO 

3648
01:56:04,824 --> 01:56:05,024
YOU. 

3649
01:56:05,024 --> 01:56:06,526
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE MY 

3650
01:56:06,526 --> 01:56:07,126
WORD FOR IT. 

3651
01:56:07,126 --> 01:56:08,494
I GET PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE 

3652
01:56:08,494 --> 01:56:08,761
HESITANT. 

3653
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:09,762
I WOULD SAY, LOOK AT THE 

3654
01:56:09,762 --> 01:56:09,995
RECORD. 

3655
01:56:09,995 --> 01:56:11,030
LOOK AT EVERYBODY WHO HAS 

3656
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:11,631
WORKED WITH ME. 

3657
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,565
AT WHAT THEY SAID. 

3658
01:56:12,565 --> 01:56:12,865
ABSOLUTELY. 

3659
01:56:12,865 --> 01:56:14,000
>> TODAY YOU STATED YOU DID NOT 

3660
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,268
MEAN IT WHEN YOU SAID THAT 

3661
01:56:15,268 --> 01:56:16,002
DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER SMILED 

3662
01:56:16,002 --> 01:56:17,403
AND YOU DID NOT MEAN IT WHEN 

3663
01:56:17,403 --> 01:56:18,805
YOU SAID THAT YOU USE THE WORD 

3664
01:56:18,805 --> 01:56:19,839
IMPEACHMENT AND WHEN YOU SAID 

3665
01:56:19,839 --> 01:56:20,506
REPUBLICANS WERE HILLBILLIES. 

3666
01:56:20,506 --> 01:56:31,451
YOU WERE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. 

3667
01:56:31,451 --> 01:56:32,251
IN THOSE MOMENTS. 

3668
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:33,086
>> I DISAGREE WITH THAT. 

3669
01:56:33,086 --> 01:56:34,988
I SAID I DID NOT MEAN IT WHEN I 

3670
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:35,922
TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU 

3671
01:56:35,922 --> 01:56:36,823
COULD SMELL THE SUPPORTER 

3672
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:37,156
HILLBILLIES. 

3673
01:56:37,156 --> 01:56:38,391
THAT WAS A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS 

3674
01:56:38,391 --> 01:56:40,159
THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT I DID 

3675
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:41,594
NOT SAY I DID NOT BELIEVE IN 

3676
01:56:41,594 --> 01:56:41,827
PEACE. 

3677
01:56:41,827 --> 01:56:42,461
MY EXPLANATION WAS DIFFERENT. 

3678
01:56:42,461 --> 01:56:43,629
THAT WAS, AS I CONSIDERED IT, 

3679
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,298
THAT WAS ON THE FAR END OF WHAT 

3680
01:56:45,298 --> 01:56:45,932
MIGHT BE OCCURRING. 

3681
01:56:45,932 --> 01:56:47,166
WHAT I SAID WAS THE OPPOSITE. 

3682
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:48,201
>> I UNDERSTAND FINALLY, THE 

3683
01:56:48,201 --> 01:56:48,901
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE ASSERTIONS 

3684
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:49,735
THAT ARE NOT TRUE. 

3685
01:56:49,735 --> 01:56:51,170
FIRST THAT THE IG FOUND NO BIAS 

3686
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:51,737
IN YOUR ACTIONS. 

3687
01:56:51,737 --> 01:56:52,972
THIS IS NOT TRUE. 

3688
01:56:52,972 --> 01:56:58,678
THE A.G. 

3689
01:56:58,678 --> 01:56:59,846
SAID, QUOTE, WE WERE DEEPLY 

3690
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:00,747
TROUBLED BY TEXT MESSAGES SENT 

3691
01:57:00,747 --> 01:57:01,881
BY PETER STRZOK AND PAGE THAT 

3692
01:57:01,881 --> 01:57:02,748
INDICATED OR CREATED THE 

3693
01:57:02,748 --> 01:57:03,549
APPEARANCE THAT INVESTIGATIVE 

3694
01:57:03,549 --> 01:57:05,084
DECISIONS WERE IMPACTED BY BIAS 

3695
01:57:05,084 --> 01:57:07,453
OR IMPROPER CONSIDERATION. 

3696
01:57:07,453 --> 01:57:08,421
SMACKING RIGHT AND YOU READ 

3697
01:57:08,421 --> 01:57:09,522
WHAT YOU JUST SAID, POTENTIALLY 

3698
01:57:09,522 --> 01:57:10,022
CREATE THE APPEARANCE. 

3699
01:57:10,022 --> 01:57:11,791
THAT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT AN ACT 

3700
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:13,159
OF BIAS. 

3701
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:14,594
IT IS A HEDGE 23 ADJECTIVE 

3702
01:57:14,594 --> 01:57:15,161
DESCRIPTION ABOUT SOMETHING 

3703
01:57:15,161 --> 01:57:18,030
WHICH I CAN TELL YOU DOES NOT 

3704
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:38,451
EXIST. 

3705
01:57:38,451 --> 01:57:39,585
>> MOREOVER AS WE DESCRIBE IN 

3706
01:57:39,585 --> 01:57:40,186
ASSESSING PETER STRZOK'S 

3707
01:57:40,186 --> 01:57:40,953
DECISION TO PRIORITIZE THE 

3708
01:57:40,953 --> 01:57:41,621
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION OVER 

3709
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:42,522
FOLLOWING UP ON THE MEDIA 

3710
01:57:42,522 --> 01:57:43,455
RELATED INVESTIGATIVE LEAD, 

3711
01:57:43,455 --> 01:57:44,157
DISCOVERING THE LAPTOP IN 

3712
01:57:44,157 --> 01:57:44,857
OCTOBER 2016, THESE TEXT 

3713
01:57:44,857 --> 01:57:45,892
MESSAGES LEAD US TO CONCLUDE 

3714
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:47,126
THAT WE DID NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE 

3715
01:57:47,126 --> 01:57:48,161
THAT PETER STRZOK'S DECISIONS 

3716
01:57:48,161 --> 01:57:48,694
WERE FREE FROM BIAS. 

3717
01:57:48,694 --> 01:57:49,028
>> YES. 

3718
01:57:49,028 --> 01:57:50,463
>> SO THERE WAS NO DECISION 

3719
01:57:50,463 --> 01:57:51,264
THAT THERE WAS NO BIAS. 

3720
01:57:51,264 --> 01:57:52,465
THEY JUST CANNOT FIND WHETHER 

3721
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:53,599
THERE WAS BIAS OR NOT AND 

3722
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:54,634
MOREOVER, THEY DID NOT REALLY 

3723
01:57:54,634 --> 01:57:54,800
-- 

3724
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:55,735
>> AND MR. CHAIRMAN, REGULAR 

3725
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:55,968
ORDER. 

3726
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:57,203
>> THEY DID NOT INVESTIGATE  

3727
01:57:57,203 --> 01:57:57,937
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION SO 

3728
01:57:57,937 --> 01:57:58,604
THERE IS PENDING. 

3729
01:57:58,604 --> 01:57:59,972
>> THE GENTLEMAN IS OUT OF TIME 

3730
01:57:59,972 --> 01:58:00,673
AND YIELDS BACK. 

3731
01:58:00,673 --> 01:58:01,807
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. 

3732
01:58:01,807 --> 01:58:03,308
I DID NOT HEAR A QUESTION. 

3733
01:58:03,308 --> 01:58:10,450
>> I DO NOT AGREE BUT HE WAS 

3734
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:11,384
ASKING ME WHETHER I BELIEVE 

3735
01:58:11,384 --> 01:58:12,385
THAT THE IG REPORT INDICATED 

3736
01:58:12,385 --> 01:58:14,320
THAT THERE WAS AN ACT OF BIAS.  

3737
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,521
LIKE THEY ARE FREE TO HEAR YOUR 

3738
01:58:15,521 --> 01:58:16,856
ANSWER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK 

3739
01:58:16,856 --> 01:58:17,924
THAT THE WITNESS HE PERMITTED 

3740
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:18,791
TO ANSWER A QUESTION. 

3741
01:58:18,791 --> 01:58:23,162
>> MAY I RESPOND? 

3742
01:58:23,162 --> 01:58:24,564
SIR, LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS OF 

3743
01:58:24,564 --> 01:58:25,598
THE LAPTOP THEY ARE WITHIN 

3744
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:26,599
HOURS, LITERALLY LESS THAN FOUR 

3745
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:28,100
HOURS OF LEARNING, I SIGNED 

3746
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:43,082
AGENT TO GO AND CHECK IN AND 

3747
01:58:43,082 --> 01:58:43,916
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS -- 

3748
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:45,084
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT WAS NOT 

3749
01:58:45,084 --> 01:58:45,818
THE QUESTION. 

3750
01:58:45,818 --> 01:58:46,919
>> WITHIN A DAY THEY HAD DONE 

3751
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:48,387
SO AND THOSE WERE THE FOLKS ON 

3752
01:58:48,387 --> 01:58:49,555

IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A SHORT 

3755

RESPONSE TO A QUESTION THAT HE 

3756
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:54,660
DOES NOT BELIEVE HE ASKED, YOU 

3757
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:56,095
ARE WELCOME TO DO IT BUT KEEP 

3758
01:58:56,095 --> 01:58:56,562

ISSUE AND I DO TAKE ISSUE WITH

THE IG CONCLUSION THAT SAID 

3765
01:59:13,179 --> 01:59:14,146
SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD NOT 

3766
01:59:14,146 --> 01:59:15,214
EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT 

3767
01:59:15,214 --> 01:59:16,782
PLAYED A ROLE IN WHAT I WOULD 

3768
01:59:16,782 --> 01:59:18,017

ON THAT AND WITHIN A DAY OF 

3775
01:59:24,724 --> 01:59:25,658
GETTING THAT INFORMATION, THEY 

3776
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:26,726
HAD GOTTEN IN TOUCH WITH NEW 

3777
01:59:26,726 --> 01:59:27,760
YORK AND DETERMINED THAT NEW 

3778
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:28,761
YORK HAD NOT COMPLETED THE 

3779
01:59:28,761 --> 01:59:29,762
PROCESSING AND THAT THEY WERE 

3780
01:59:29,762 --> 01:59:33,166
GOING TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH

02:05:55,114 --> 02:05:56,081
MONTHS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY? 

3989
02:05:56,081 --> 02:05:57,916
>> MY SENSE WAS IN A PERSONAL 

3990
02:05:57,916 --> 02:06:07,826
BELIEF THAT I WAS NOT PLEASED 

3991
02:06:07,826 --> 02:06:08,627
WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THINGS 

3992
02:06:08,627 --> 02:06:09,728
ARE BEING DONE WITH THE 

3993
02:06:09,728 --> 02:06:10,028
PRESIDENCY. 

3994
02:06:10,028 --> 02:06:10,996
>> I THOUGHT THAT YOU TRUSTED 

3995
02:06:10,996 --> 02:06:11,563
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

3996
02:06:11,563 --> 02:06:13,065
I THOUGHT THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID 

3997
02:06:13,065 --> 02:06:14,233
IN AUGUST 2016, IF THE AMERICAN 

3998
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:15,534
PEOPLE WOULD STOP HIM AND THEN 

3999
02:06:15,534 --> 02:06:16,535
THEY DID NOT STOP HERE. 

4000
02:06:16,535 --> 02:06:18,070
HERE WE ARE IN MARCH AND ALL OF 

4001
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:18,537
A SUDDEN. 

4002
02:06:18,537 --> 02:06:19,805
TRUSTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

4003
02:06:19,805 --> 02:06:22,007
ANYMORE. 

4004
02:06:22,007 --> 02:06:28,180
>> I UTTERLY TRUSTED THE 

4005
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:29,281
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT I WORRY 

4006
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:30,649
ABOUT IS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF 

4007
02:06:30,649 --> 02:06:31,483
RUSSIA PUTS THEIR FINGERS ON 

4008
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:32,751
THE SCALE AND CAUSES THAT WILL 

4009
02:06:32,751 --> 02:06:33,519
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

4010
02:06:33,519 --> 02:06:34,319
OTHER THAN AMERICA. 

4011
02:06:34,319 --> 02:06:35,220
>> HOW MANY INDICTMENTS HAVE 

4012
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:36,121
THERE BEEN OF AMERICANS FOR 

4013
02:06:36,121 --> 02:06:36,789
COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA? 

4014
02:06:36,789 --> 02:06:37,956
>> I COULD NOT ANSWER THE 

4015
02:06:37,956 --> 02:06:38,424
QUESTION. 

4016
02:06:38,424 --> 02:06:39,224
TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN. 

4017
02:06:39,224 --> 02:06:40,192
YOU WORKED ON THE 

4018
02:06:40,192 --> 02:06:40,559
INVESTIGATION. 

4019
02:06:40,559 --> 02:06:41,427
>> YOU KNOW FULL WELL THAT 

4020
02:06:41,427 --> 02:06:42,628
COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME. 

4021
02:06:42,628 --> 02:06:44,463
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE TERM 

4022
02:06:44,463 --> 02:06:54,273
CAME FROM. 

4023
02:06:54,273 --> 02:06:54,673
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

4024
02:06:54,673 --> 02:06:55,708
>> IT IS NOT CONSPIRACY, 

4025
02:06:55,708 --> 02:06:56,241
COORDINATION, COLLUSION. 

4026
02:06:56,241 --> 02:06:57,476
A LOT OF PEOPLE USE THOSE WORDS 

4027
02:06:57,476 --> 02:06:58,344
IN THE SAME WAY. 

4028
02:06:58,344 --> 02:06:59,344
HOW ABOUT WE SAY CONSPIRACY? 

4029
02:06:59,344 --> 02:07:00,279
HOW MANY AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 

4030
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:01,113
INDICTED FOR CONSPIRING WITH 

4031
02:07:01,113 --> 02:07:02,147
RUSSIA TO IMPACT THE 2016 

4032
02:07:02,147 --> 02:07:02,414
ELECTION? 

4033
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:03,648
>> NONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE, YET. 

4034
02:07:03,648 --> 02:07:05,284
>> WE WILL BE HAPPY TO GET MR. 

4035
02:07:05,284 --> 02:07:06,652
NADLER AS A WITNESS AT NEST -- 

4036
02:07:06,652 --> 02:07:08,020
NEXT WEEK'S HEARING IF HE WANTS 

4037
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:09,054
TO HELP YOU ANSWER THAT. 

4038
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:19,798
SO YOU WANTED PRESIDENT TRUMP 

4039
02:07:19,798 --> 02:07:20,866
TO RESIGN TWO MONTHS INTO HIS 

4040
02:07:20,866 --> 02:07:21,233
PRESIDENCY. 

4041
02:07:21,233 --> 02:07:21,633
>> NO, SIR. 

4042
02:07:21,633 --> 02:07:23,302
I THINK I READ THAT AS A SNARKY 

4043
02:07:23,302 --> 02:07:24,570
COMMENT ABOUT A BOOK THAT WAS 

4044
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:25,904
BEING A RED AND A COMMENT THAT 

4045
02:07:25,904 --> 02:07:27,206
WAS MADE THAT IT IS A 

4046
02:07:27,206 --> 02:07:27,806
CONVERSATIONAL TEXT EXCHANGE 

4047
02:07:27,806 --> 02:07:29,208
AND NOT A WRITTEN -- A DESIRE 

4048
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:29,942
FOR SOMETHING TO OCCUR. 

4049
02:07:29,942 --> 02:07:31,543
>> MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT HELP 

4050
02:07:31,543 --> 02:07:31,709
ME. 

4051
02:07:31,709 --> 02:07:48,360
DIED THAT WE SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

4052
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,261
>> YES, SIR. 

4053
02:07:49,261 --> 02:07:50,596
I THINK YOU WOULD EXCEPT AS A 

4054
02:07:50,596 --> 02:07:51,130
VERY INTELLIGENT AND 

4055
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:51,997
SOPHISTICATED MAN THAT PEOPLE 

4056
02:07:51,997 --> 02:07:52,965
FREQUENTLY SPEAK WHEN THEY ARE 

4057
02:07:52,965 --> 02:07:53,932
TEXTING AND IN CONVERSATION AND 

4058
02:07:53,932 --> 02:07:55,367
YOU WILL SAY THINGS THAT ARE 

4059
02:07:55,367 --> 02:07:56,001
HYPERBOLE OR EXAGGERATION OR 

4060
02:07:56,001 --> 02:07:57,236
NOT LITERAL BECAUSE THAT IS 

4061
02:07:57,236 --> 02:07:58,403
JUST THE NATURE OF THE WAY THAT 

4062
02:07:58,403 --> 02:07:58,804
WE SPEAK? 

4063
02:07:58,804 --> 02:08:00,005
USUALLY AGENT STRZOK NOT WHEN I 

4064
02:08:00,005 --> 02:08:01,006
AM SUPPOSED TO BE VIRTUALLY 

4065
02:08:01,006 --> 02:08:01,506
INVESTIGATED SOMEONE. 

4066
02:08:01,506 --> 02:08:02,241
I ACTUALLY DID NOT. 

4067
02:08:02,241 --> 02:08:02,674
LET'S GO. 

4068
02:08:02,674 --> 02:08:03,242
LET'S GO. 

4069
02:08:03,242 --> 02:08:04,376
WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE WHO 

4070
02:08:04,376 --> 02:08:15,654
GIVES A LETTER OF ONE MORE -- 

4071
02:08:15,654 --> 02:08:16,388
VERSUS THE INVESTIGATION THAT 

4072
02:08:16,388 --> 02:08:16,921
LEADING TO IMPEACHMENT. 

4073
02:08:16,921 --> 02:08:17,723
WE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED 

4074
02:08:17,723 --> 02:08:19,124
THAT THERE IS A SCHOOL OF 

4075
02:08:19,124 --> 02:08:19,925
THOUGHT THAT YOU CAN BE 

4076
02:08:19,925 --> 02:08:21,393
IMPEACHED EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A 

4077
02:08:21,393 --> 02:08:22,261
CURRENT OFFICE HOLDER. 

4078
02:08:22,261 --> 02:08:23,195
YOU CAN BE BARRED FROM HOLDING 

4079
02:08:23,195 --> 02:08:24,396
OFFICE IN THE FUTURE, BUT YOU 

4080
02:08:24,396 --> 02:08:25,697
DID NOT ENGAGE IN ANY 

4081
02:08:25,697 --> 02:08:26,297
IMPEACHMENT ANALYSIS IN YOUR 

4082
02:08:26,297 --> 02:08:26,898
OTHER 2016 INVESTIGATION. 

4083
02:08:26,898 --> 02:08:27,632
IT WAS SECRETARY CLINTON. 

4084
02:08:27,632 --> 02:08:29,368
YOU SAVED ALL OF THAT FOR THE 

4085
02:08:29,368 --> 02:08:29,868
CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP. 

4086
02:08:29,868 --> 02:08:31,169
SO I WANTED TO GO TO ANOTHER 

4087
02:08:31,169 --> 02:08:31,570
TEXT. 

4088
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:33,372
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE ODDS 

4089
02:08:33,372 --> 02:08:36,441
ARE NOTHING. 

4090
02:08:36,441 --> 02:08:37,843
IF I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKELY, I 

4091
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:38,343
WOULD BE THERE. 

4092
02:08:38,343 --> 02:08:38,676
NO QUESTION. 

4093
02:08:38,676 --> 02:08:39,945
NOW THIS IS THE DAY AFTER 

4094
02:08:39,945 --> 02:08:40,979
ROBERT MUELLER WAS APPOINTED. 

4095
02:08:40,979 --> 02:08:42,214
WHEN YOU SAID BE THERE, ARE YOU 

4096
02:08:42,214 --> 02:08:43,649
TALKING ABOUT ON HIS TEAM? 

4097
02:08:43,649 --> 02:08:43,882
>> YES. 

4098
02:08:43,882 --> 02:08:44,850
>> I HESITATE IN PART BECAUSE 

4099
02:08:44,850 --> 02:08:46,051
OF MICAH SENSE AND CONCERN. 

4100
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:57,329
THERE IS NO BIG THERE THERE. 

4101
02:08:57,329 --> 02:08:58,129
SO IN ADDITION TO DISAPPOINTING 

4102
02:08:58,129 --> 02:08:59,364
THE HELL OUT OF MY DEMOCRAT 

4103
02:08:59,364 --> 02:09:00,365
COLLEAGUES, THAT SOMEONE WHO IS 

4104
02:09:00,365 --> 02:09:00,999
INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN COLLUSION 

4105
02:09:00,999 --> 02:09:02,234
DID NOT THINK THAT THERE WAS 

4106
02:09:02,234 --> 02:09:03,402
ANY THERE THERE, WHY WOULD YOU 

4107
02:09:03,402 --> 02:09:03,902
BE CONCERNED? 

4108
02:09:03,902 --> 02:09:05,304
WHY WOULD YOU NOT BE ECSTATIC 

4109
02:09:05,304 --> 02:09:06,204
THAT THERE WAS NO COLLUSION? 

4110
02:09:06,204 --> 02:09:11,076
WHY THE WORD CONCERN? 

4111
02:09:11,076 --> 02:09:12,744
>> SIR, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I 

4112
02:09:12,744 --> 02:09:13,011
MEANT. 

4113
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:14,279
CONCERN TO ME SEEMS LIKE THERE 

4114
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:15,814
IS A LOT GOING ON AND A LOT 

4115
02:09:15,814 --> 02:09:17,015
PRESUMPTIVE THAT THERE MAY BE 

4116
02:09:17,015 --> 02:09:26,558
SOMETHING LIKE IMPEACHMENT BUT 

4117
02:09:26,558 --> 02:09:28,093
YOU HAVE GOT TO PICK PICK WHICH 

4118
02:09:28,093 --> 02:09:28,794
ONE DO YOU WANT? 

4119
02:09:28,794 --> 02:09:29,995
I AM EITHER CONVINCED THAT 

4120
02:09:29,995 --> 02:09:31,230
THERE IS IMPEACHMENT OR I AM 

4121
02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:32,064
CONVINCED WHAT YOU JUST READ, 

4122
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:33,265
THAT THERE IS NO THERE THERE. 

4123
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:34,466
AND THE REALITY, SIR, IF YOU 

4124
02:09:34,466 --> 02:09:36,301
LOOK AT IT IS THE FACT, THAT I 

4125
02:09:36,301 --> 02:09:37,369
WAS LOOKING AT THIS WITH AN 

4126
02:09:37,369 --> 02:09:39,171
OPEN MIND AND SAYING, I DO NOT 

4127
02:09:39,171 --> 02:09:49,081
KNOW THIS MAXIMA AGENT STRZOK, 

4128
02:09:49,081 --> 02:09:50,415
OF ALL OF THE UNIVERSAL 

4129
02:09:50,415 --> 02:09:51,350
OPTIONS, THAT IS NOT THE ONE 

4130
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:52,851
THAT I PICKED OF ALL OF THE 

4131
02:09:52,851 --> 02:09:53,785
UNIVERSE OF OPTIONS, YOU 

4132
02:09:53,785 --> 02:09:54,686
LOOKING AT SOMETHING WITH AN 

4133
02:09:54,686 --> 02:09:56,021
OPEN MIND IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 

4134
02:09:56,021 --> 02:09:56,321
I PICKED. 

4135
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:57,723
>> THAT IS THE OBVIOUS WANT TO 

4136
02:09:57,723 --> 02:09:58,557
CONCLUDE FROM THE EMAIL. 

4137
02:09:58,557 --> 02:10:00,125
>> I WILL TELL YOU THE ONE THAT 

4138
02:10:00,125 --> 02:10:00,692
I PICKED. 

4139
02:10:00,692 --> 02:10:01,960
THE ONE THAT I PICKED AND IT 

4140
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:03,428
BREAKS MY HEART TO SAY THIS 

4141
02:10:03,428 --> 02:10:04,429
ABOUT AN AGENT FOR AN AGENCY 

4142
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:05,564
THAT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT 

4143
02:10:05,564 --> 02:10:05,764
FOR. 

4144
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:06,497
YOU AS A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 

4145
02:10:06,497 --> 02:10:07,599
OFFICER HAD NO INTEREST IN 

4146
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:08,032
PARTICIPATING IN A 

4147
02:10:08,032 --> 02:10:08,466
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 

4148
02:10:08,466 --> 02:10:09,234
INVESTIGATION THAT WAS NOT 

4149
02:10:09,234 --> 02:10:11,436
GOING TO LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT. 

4150
02:10:11,436 --> 02:10:12,638
THAT IS HOW I READ IT. 

4151
02:10:12,638 --> 02:10:13,872
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU ARE --'S 

4152
02:10:13,872 --> 02:10:14,473
BACK NO QUESTION. 

4153
02:10:14,473 --> 02:10:15,974
>>> YOU ARE ASSUMING SOMEONE 

4154
02:10:15,974 --> 02:10:27,686
ELSE. 

4155
02:10:27,686 --> 02:10:28,954
MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU ARE COMING TO 

4156
02:10:28,954 --> 02:10:29,720
CONCLUSION ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S 

4157
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:30,855
VIEWPOINTS IN THE HEARING. 

4158
02:10:30,855 --> 02:10:31,657
ALLOW THE WITNESS TO RESPOND. 

4159
02:10:31,657 --> 02:10:33,191
>>> I WILL -- I'M SURE THAT MY 

4160
02:10:33,191 --> 02:10:34,025
TIME IS NOT RECOGNIZED. 

4161
02:10:34,025 --> 02:10:35,427
I HESITATE IN PART BECAUSE OF 

4162
02:10:35,427 --> 02:10:36,528
MY GUT SENSE AND CONCERN THAT 

4163
02:10:36,528 --> 02:10:37,829
THERE IS NO BIG THERE THERE. 

4164
02:10:37,829 --> 02:10:38,864
WHAT WERE YOU CONCERNED WAS NOT 

4165
02:10:38,864 --> 02:10:39,097
THERE? 

4166
02:10:39,097 --> 02:10:40,299
>> SIR, MY CONCERN WAS NOT 

4167
02:10:40,299 --> 02:10:40,933
KNOWING, GIVEN THESE 

4168
02:10:40,933 --> 02:10:59,985
ALLEGATIONS, WHAT EXISTED. 

4169
02:10:59,985 --> 02:11:01,019
WHETHER ON THE ONE HAND, THERE 

4170
02:11:01,019 --> 02:11:02,187
WAS NO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY 

4171
02:11:02,187 --> 02:11:02,821
WHATSOEVER TOWARDS THE MIDDLE, 

4172
02:11:02,821 --> 02:11:03,722
THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL KIND 

4173
02:11:03,722 --> 02:11:04,690
OF PURSUING THEIR OWN AGENDAS 

4174
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:05,690
FOR THEIR OWN SELF ENRICHMENT 

4175
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:07,225
OR ON THE FAR END THAT THERE

<font color="#FF00FF"><u>IGHT BE AN IMPEACHABLE </u></font>

4177
02:11:08,026 --> 02:11:08,292
OFFENSE. 

4178
02:11:08,292 --> 02:11:09,661
>> WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO 

4179
02:11:09,661 --> 02:11:09,994
INVESTIGATE? 

4180
02:11:09,994 --> 02:11:11,229
>> MY ANSWER TO QUESTION -- 

4181
02:11:11,229 --> 02:11:12,364
>> MY QUESTION IS WHY WOULD YOU 

4182
02:11:12,364 --> 02:11:20,072
NOT WANT TO INVESTIGATE THAT?  

4183
02:11:20,072 --> 02:11:21,373
>> I DID WANT TO INVESTIGATE 

4184
02:11:21,373 --> 02:11:21,573
THAT. 

4185
02:11:21,573 --> 02:11:22,708
THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE 

4186
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:22,975
READING. 

4187
02:11:22,975 --> 02:11:24,176
WHAT YOU ARE READING IS MY 

4188
02:11:24,176 --> 02:11:25,610
TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT I WANT TO 

4189
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:26,979
DO WITH THE COURSE OF MY CAREER 

4190
02:11:26,979 --> 02:11:28,580
AND A WHETHER TO STAY AS A 

4191
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:29,514
DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN A

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIVISION 

4193
02:11:30,147 --> 02:11:31,149
WHERE I HAVE OVERSIGHT OF A 

4194
02:11:31,149 --> 02:11:32,184
WIDE VARIETY OF THREATS AROUND 

4195
02:11:32,184 --> 02:11:33,719
THE GLOBE OR WHETHER I WANT TO 

4196
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:34,753
REMOVE MYSELF AND GO WORK ON 

4197
02:11:34,753 --> 02:11:35,587
SOMETHING IN THE SPECIAL 

4198
02:11:35,587 --> 02:11:36,755
COUNSEL'S OFFICE  THAT IS VERY 

4199
02:11:36,755 --> 02:11:38,290
SPECIFIC, THAT IS GOING TO TAKE 

4200
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:39,791
THE -- I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG. 

4201
02:11:39,791 --> 02:11:41,059
BUT TO YOUR POINT OF THIS MAKES 

4202
02:11:41,059 --> 02:11:42,361
>> YOU ARE LEAVING OUT AN 

4203
02:11:42,361 --> 02:11:42,761
IMPORTANT WORD. 

4204
02:11:42,761 --> 02:11:43,095
IMPEACHMENT. 

4205
02:11:43,095 --> 02:11:43,528
>> REGULAR ORDER. 

4206
02:11:43,528 --> 02:11:45,163
IT IS A MINUTE AND A HALF OVER. 

4207
02:11:45,163 --> 02:11:46,531
SNACK ON AND ON AND ON. 

4208
02:11:46,531 --> 02:11:47,232
>> POINT OF ORDER. 

4209
02:11:47,232 --> 02:11:47,733
TIME IS UP. 

4210
02:11:47,733 --> 02:11:48,734
LIKE IMPEACHMENT. 

4211
02:11:48,734 --> 02:12:01,212
AT FOUR BIG WORDS OF NO BIG 

4212
02:12:01,212 --> 02:12:02,147
THERE THERE AND YOU KNOW FULL 

4213
02:12:02,147 --> 02:12:03,615
WELL THAT I SAID BOTH AND YOU 

4214
02:12:03,615 --> 02:12:04,583
KNOW WHY I SAID BOTH. 

4215
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,018
WHY I DID THAT AND WHAT I'M 

4216
02:12:06,018 --> 02:12:07,252
TELLING YOU UNDER OATH IS THAT 

4217
02:12:07,252 --> 02:12:08,453
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT EXISTED. 

4218
02:12:08,453 --> 02:12:09,321
I HAD PREJUDGED NOTHING. 

4219
02:12:09,321 --> 02:12:10,521
THAT WAS ALL TO BE DETERMINED. 

4220
02:12:10,521 --> 02:12:12,323
AND THAT IS A LOGICAL WAY FOR 

4221
02:12:12,323 --> 02:12:19,197
INVESTIGATORS, ATTORNEYS, AND 

4222
02:12:19,197 --> 02:12:20,031
STARTING -- WITH THE POLITICAL 

4223
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:20,933
DEATH PENALTY AND IMPEACHMENT 

4224
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:22,267
IS NOT A LOGICAL WAY THAT A 

4225
02:12:22,267 --> 02:12:22,867
NEUTRAL, DISPASSIONATE -- 

4226
02:12:22,867 --> 02:12:23,902
>> CHAIRMAN, WE ARE DEMANDING 

4227
02:12:23,902 --> 02:12:24,302
EQUAL TIME. 

4228
02:12:24,302 --> 02:12:32,778
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

4229
02:12:32,778 --> 02:12:33,612
>> IF YOU CANNOT CONTROL 

4230
02:12:33,612 --> 02:12:34,813
YOURSELF, HOW DO YOU EXPECT 

4231
02:12:34,813 --> 02:12:35,447
THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTROL 

4232
02:12:35,447 --> 02:12:35,680
ITSELF? 

4233
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:36,982
YOU HAVE BEEN OUT OF CONTROL 

4234
02:12:36,982 --> 02:12:38,216
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS 

4235
02:12:38,216 --> 02:12:38,516
COMMITTEE. 

4236
02:12:38,516 --> 02:12:39,518
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE IT ALONE? 

4237
02:12:39,518 --> 02:12:40,452
THIS IS NOT BENGHAZI. 

4238
02:12:40,452 --> 02:12:41,653
SELECT THE GENERAL LADY FROM 

4239
02:12:41,653 --> 02:12:52,230
NEW JERSEY IS RECOGNIZED. 

4240
02:12:52,230 --> 02:12:52,998
>> YOU ARE RECOGNIZE, 

4241
02:12:52,998 --> 02:12:53,365
CONGRESSWOMAN. 

4242
02:12:53,365 --> 02:12:53,865
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. 

4243
02:12:53,865 --> 02:12:54,232
>> HALLELUJAH. 

4244
02:12:54,232 --> 02:12:55,801
>> [ LAUGHTER ] BACK FIRST OF 

4245
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:56,802
ALL, MR. STRZOK, I WANT TO 

4246
02:12:56,802 --> 02:12:58,036
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. 

4247
02:12:58,036 --> 02:12:58,904
SECONDLY MR. STRZOK, I THINK 

4248
02:12:58,904 --> 02:13:00,005
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE BY 

4249
02:13:00,005 --> 02:13:01,139
PUTTING THOSE TEXT MESSAGES ON 

4250
02:13:01,139 --> 02:13:01,672
YOUR BUSINESS TELEPHONE. 

4251
02:13:01,672 --> 02:13:02,874
BECAUSE THEN YOU OPENED UP YOUR 

4252
02:13:02,874 --> 02:13:03,875
PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND HERE WE 

4253
02:13:03,875 --> 02:13:04,876
ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS MESS 

4254
02:13:04,876 --> 02:13:06,311
WHEN IT REALLY IS NOT IMPORTANT 

4255
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:07,612
BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT I 

4256
02:13:07,612 --> 02:13:08,747
KNOW, MR. STRZOK IS THAT EVEN 

4257
02:13:08,747 --> 02:13:10,248
IF YOU DO HAVE BIASES, YOU DID 

4258
02:13:10,248 --> 02:13:12,617
NOT INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF 

4259
02:13:12,617 --> 02:13:13,852
THIS INVESTIGATION. 

4260
02:13:13,852 --> 02:13:16,955
THE ATTORNEY -- THE IG FOUND 

4261
02:13:16,955 --> 02:13:29,167
THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS 

4262
02:13:29,167 --> 02:13:29,835
INVESTIGATION WAS PREDICATED 

4263
02:13:29,835 --> 02:13:30,535
UPON EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION. 

4264
02:13:30,535 --> 02:13:31,937
THE OTHER THING THAT I KNOW IS 

4265
02:13:31,937 --> 02:13:33,305
THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU 

4266
02:13:33,305 --> 02:13:34,206
DISLIKE HILLARY CLINTON AND OR 

4267
02:13:34,206 --> 02:13:35,440
DONALD TRUMP, YOU DID NOT HAVE 

4268
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:36,775
ANYTHING TO DO WITH EITHER ONE 

4269
02:13:36,775 --> 02:13:37,442
OF THEM GETTING ELECTED. 

4270
02:13:37,442 --> 02:13:38,910
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 

4271
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:43,982
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

4272
02:13:43,982 --> 02:13:44,749
DISGRACING THIS COUNTRY EVERY 

4273
02:13:44,749 --> 02:13:45,750
SINGLE SOLITARY DAY WHEN HE 

4274
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:48,020
EMBRACES OUR ENEMIES AND SUCKS 

4275
02:13:48,020 --> 02:14:00,832
UP -- EMBRACES OUR ENEMIES AND 

4276
02:14:00,832 --> 02:14:01,900
IS DISRESPECTFUL TO OUR ALLIES. 

4277
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:03,401
YOU HAVENOTHING TO DO WITH THE 

4278
02:14:03,401 --> 02:14:04,436
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

4279
02:14:04,436 --> 02:14:05,303
UNITED STATES HAS DECLARED 

4280
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:06,438
HIGHER TERRORISTS IN THE NAME 

4281
02:14:06,438 --> 02:14:07,439
OF SECURITY TO THIS NATION 

4282
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:08,673
AGAINST OUR CLOSEST FRIEND AND 

4283
02:14:08,673 --> 02:14:13,211
NEIGHBOR, CANADA, BUT NO ONE ON 

4284
02:14:13,211 --> 02:14:14,179
THIS SIDE OF THE AISLE HAS 

4285
02:14:14,179 --> 02:14:14,980
OPENED THEIR MOUTH. 

4286
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:24,022
YOU HAVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 

4287
02:14:24,022 --> 02:14:24,890
THE PRESIDENT AND ENRICHING 

4288
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:25,790
HIMSELF WITH HIS EMOLUMENTS AND 

4289
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:26,558
CARVING OUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR 

4290
02:14:26,558 --> 02:14:28,093
HIS DAUGHTER SO THAT SHE IS NOT 

4291
02:14:28,093 --> 02:14:29,561
NEGATIVELY IMPACTEDWITH HER 

4292
02:14:29,561 --> 02:14:32,264
BRANDS IN CHINA, WHILE THIS 

4293
02:14:32,264 --> 02:14:33,465
SIDE OF THE AISLE SAYS NOTHING. 

4294
02:14:33,465 --> 02:14:34,933
YOU HAVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 

4295
02:14:34,933 --> 02:14:36,034
THE FACT THAT PUERTO RICO IS 

4296
02:14:36,034 --> 02:14:43,708
STILL UNDERWATER AND WITHOUT 

4297
02:14:43,708 --> 02:14:45,010
ANY KIND OF ELECTRICITY AND 70 

4298
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:46,044
PLACES, WHY THIS SIDE OF THE 

4299
02:14:46,044 --> 02:14:47,479
AISLE THAT IS A PART OF THE 

4300
02:14:47,479 --> 02:14:48,079
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, HAS 

4301
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:49,181
FORGOTTEN WHAT IT'S MISSION IS. 

4302
02:14:49,181 --> 02:14:50,582
BUT NONETHELESS, YOU HAVE BEEN 

4303
02:14:50,582 --> 02:14:52,784
HERE AND YOU HAVE TRIED TO 

4304
02:14:52,784 --> 02:14:53,785
ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS AND I 

4305
02:14:53,785 --> 02:14:54,619
HAVE NEVER SEEN MY COLLEAGUES 

4306
02:14:54,619 --> 02:14:58,089
SO OUT OF CONTROL, SO ANGRY, 

4307
02:14:58,089 --> 02:14:59,391
AND SO DESPERATE TO PROTECT A 

4308
02:14:59,391 --> 02:15:02,594
PRESIDENT THAT WE ALL KNOW IS 

4309
02:15:02,594 --> 02:15:03,595
NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT. 

4310
02:15:03,595 --> 02:15:06,031
SO I WANT TO LEAVE YOU THIS 

4311
02:15:06,031 --> 02:15:06,898
OPPORTUNITY. 

4312
02:15:06,898 --> 02:15:10,702
IS THERE ANY QUESTION ON THE 

4313
02:15:10,702 --> 02:15:19,978
TABLE, MR. STRZOK, THAT YOU 

4314
02:15:19,978 --> 02:15:21,279
HAVE BEEN ASKED THAT YOU WOULD 

4315
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:21,880
LIKE TO CLARIFY? 

4316
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,014
BECAUSE I CAN GIVE YOU TWO 

4317
02:15:23,014 --> 02:15:24,282
MINUTES AND 25 SECONDS TO HAVE 

4318
02:15:24,282 --> 02:15:25,417
YOUR SAY UNINTERRUPTED. 

4319
02:15:25,417 --> 02:15:27,652
MET CONGRESSWOMAN, I DEEPLY 

4320
02:15:27,652 --> 02:15:29,087
APPRECIATE THAT TIME. 

4321
02:15:29,087 --> 02:15:35,127
I DO WANT THIS EVERYBODY IS 

4322
02:15:35,127 --> 02:15:36,094
WATCHING THIS AND MAKING UP 

4323
02:15:36,094 --> 02:15:37,362
THEIR OWN MIND, AND WHAT I 

4324
02:15:37,362 --> 02:15:39,797
WOULD TELL YOU IS, ONE, I AM 

4325
02:15:39,797 --> 02:15:42,033
SITTING HERE TELLING YOU THE 

4326
02:15:42,033 --> 02:15:44,603
TRUTH AND TWO, INDEPENDENT OF 

4327
02:15:44,603 --> 02:15:47,072
ME, I CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOU MY 

4328
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:51,910
LOVE OF THE FBI ENOUGH. THE MEN 

4329
02:15:51,910 --> 02:15:53,912
AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THAT 

4330
02:15:53,912 --> 02:16:00,818
WORKFORCE -- THEIR ETHICS, 

4331
02:16:00,818 --> 02:16:01,653
THEIR INTEGRITY, ARE UNMATCHED 

4332
02:16:01,653 --> 02:16:02,487
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

4333
02:16:02,487 --> 02:16:03,688
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT, ONE, 

4334
02:16:03,688 --> 02:16:04,889
BECAUSE IT IS WHO WE ARE. 

4335
02:16:04,889 --> 02:16:14,232
TWO, THAT NONE OF THEM WOULD 

4336
02:16:14,232 --> 02:16:15,333
ACCEPT ANY OF THE BEHAVIORS 

4337
02:16:15,333 --> 02:16:16,501
THAT ARE BEING ALLEGED ANY MORE 

4338
02:16:16,501 --> 02:16:17,902
THAN I WOULD ACCEPT IT IN HIM 

4339
02:16:17,902 --> 02:16:18,670
AND, THREE, THIS ENTIRE 

4340
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:19,704
EXERCISE COMES AT A COST. 

4341
02:16:19,704 --> 02:16:21,006
WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT ARE 

4342
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:24,809
GOING TO COME IN THE FUTURE, 

4343
02:16:24,809 --> 02:16:25,777
TEAR DOWN THE UNDERPINNINGS OF 

4344
02:16:25,777 --> 02:16:27,012
WHAT REPRESENT LAW AND ORDER IN 

4345
02:16:27,012 --> 02:16:27,445
THIS COUNTRY. 

4346
02:16:27,445 --> 02:16:30,482
AND THERE IS NOT A ROBUST TAKE 

4347
02:16:30,482 --> 02:16:31,917
A WALL THERE BUT I THINK THAT 

4348
02:16:31,917 --> 02:16:33,485
PEOPLE DO NOT APPRECIATE HOW 

4349
02:16:33,485 --> 02:16:48,867
TENUOUS THE BALANCE OF THE RULE 

4350
02:16:48,867 --> 02:16:49,800
OF LAW VERSUS CHAOS IS. 

4351
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,303
WHEN WE, AS A PEOPLE, ENGAGE IN 

4352
02:16:51,303 --> 02:16:51,969
ACTIVITY WHERE WE TAKE 

4353
02:16:51,969 --> 02:16:52,637
INSTITUTIONS WHOLESALE, WHETHER 

4354
02:16:52,637 --> 02:16:53,805
THE FBI OR THE U.S. 

4355
02:16:53,805 --> 02:16:54,439
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, AND WE 

4356
02:16:54,439 --> 02:16:55,473
COMPARE THEM TO NAZIS, WE 

4357
02:16:55,473 --> 02:16:56,540
DESTROY THINGS THAT, ONE, WE 

4358
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:57,909
MAY NOT  SEE FOR YEARS AND 

4359
02:16:57,909 --> 02:16:59,277
YEARS AND YEARS AND ONCE WE 

4360
02:16:59,277 --> 02:17:00,611
BREAK THOSE DOWN, THE AMOUNT OF 

4361
02:17:00,611 --> 02:17:01,846
TIME THAT IT TAKES TO FIX IS 

4362
02:17:01,846 --> 02:17:03,147
GOING TO BE TENFOLD AND I 

4363
02:17:03,147 --> 02:17:04,382
CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT I ASK 

4364
02:17:04,382 --> 02:17:05,617
ALL OF YOU TO TAKE DEEPLY YOUR 

4365
02:17:05,617 --> 02:17:12,757
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR 

4366
02:17:12,757 --> 02:17:13,225

4367
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:14,259
>> THANK YOU, MR. STRZOK. 

4368
02:17:14,259 --> 02:17:15,660

4369
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:16,795

THE UNITED STATES BY NOT 

4373
02:17:22,133 --> 02:17:23,300
REVEALING TO THE PEOPLE THAT HE 

4374
02:17:23,300 --> 02:17:24,335
WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN HIS 

4375
02:17:24,335 --> 02:17:26,971
CAMPAIGN, IT SHOULD BE ME. 

4376
02:17:26,971 --> 02:17:27,939
THEY SHOULD BE APPLAUDING YOU, 

4377
02:17:27,939 --> 02:17:29,607
KISSING YOU, AND GIVING YOU ALL 

4378

4407
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,135
>> MR. STRZOK, I APPRECIATE YOU 

4408
02:18:30,135 --> 02:18:31,403
BEING HERE AND I WILL ASSURE 

4409
02:18:31,403 --> 02:18:32,736
YOU THAT I TAKE THIS VERY 

4410
02:18:32,736 --> 02:18:33,938
SERIOUSLY BUT I WANT TO COME AS 

4411
02:18:33,938 --> 02:18:35,473
YOU GO AND LOOK AND THERE HAS 

4412
02:18:35,473 --> 02:18:36,841
BEEN A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT 

4413
02:18:36,841 --> 02:18:37,976
TEXTING AND ABOUT YOUR BIAS AND 

4414
02:18:37,976 --> 02:18:39,144
NON-BIAS IN YOUR OPINIONS AND 

4415
02:18:39,144 --> 02:18:40,178
YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ELABORATE 

4416
02:18:40,178 --> 02:18:44,148
ON THAT. 

4417
02:18:44,148 --> 02:18:45,350
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WILL 

4418
02:18:45,350 --> 02:18:46,985
NOT REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE TO BE 

4419
02:18:46,985 --> 02:18:47,485
ELABORATE OR ANYTHING. 

4420
02:18:47,485 --> 02:18:48,286
THEY WILL BE SIMPLE AND 

4421
02:18:48,286 --> 02:18:48,686
STRAIGHTFORWARD. 

4422
02:18:48,686 --> 02:18:49,620
AS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH 

4423
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:50,955
THIS AND TALKING TO THE CURRENT 

4424
02:18:50,955 --> 02:18:51,923
FBI DIRECTOR AND THE CURRENT 

4425
02:18:51,923 --> 02:18:52,790
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND 

4426
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:53,591
READING THROUGH THEM THINGS, 

4427
02:18:53,591 --> 02:18:54,793
THINGS HAVE POPPED UP THAT I 

4428
02:18:54,793 --> 02:18:55,559
THINK NEED SOME CLARIFICATION. 

4429
02:18:55,559 --> 02:18:56,960
WHAT WAS LAST TIME YOU WERE 

4430
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,495
SUBJECT TO A POLYGRAPH? 

4431
02:18:58,495 --> 02:19:02,834
>> APPROXIMATELY TWO OR THREE 

4432
02:19:02,834 --> 02:19:03,868
YEARS AGO.'S BACK TWO OR THREE 

4433
02:19:03,868 --> 02:19:04,903
YEARS AGO BUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE 

4434
02:19:04,903 --> 02:19:05,837
HAVE YOU EVER FAILED A 

4435
02:19:05,837 --> 02:19:07,472
POLYGRAPH OR FOUND TO BE OUT OF 

4436
02:19:07,472 --> 02:19:07,705
SCOPE? 

4437
02:19:07,705 --> 02:19:08,673
BUT I HAVE NEVER FAILED ONE. 

4438
02:19:08,673 --> 02:19:10,941
I WAS OUT OF SCOPE PRIOR TO MY 

4439
02:19:10,941 --> 02:19:32,263
LAST POLYGRAPH. 

4440
02:19:32,263 --> 02:19:33,798
>> AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN 

4441
02:19:33,798 --> 02:19:34,199
WHAT TIME? 

4442
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:35,333
TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO? 

4443
02:19:35,333 --> 02:19:36,267
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC? 

4444
02:19:36,267 --> 02:19:37,802
BUT I THINK WE CAN CUT TO THE 

4445
02:19:37,802 --> 02:19:39,170
CHASE AND I THINK THERE IS AN 

4446
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:40,370
EMAIL THAT TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE 

4447
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:41,439
BEING OUT OF SCOPE WHICH 

4448
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:42,073
GENERATED THE LAST POLYGRAPH. 

4449
02:19:42,073 --> 02:19:43,608
>> WE ARE GOING TO CUT TO THE 

4450
02:19:43,608 --> 02:19:43,907
CHASE. 

4451
02:19:43,907 --> 02:19:45,343
YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND SAY 

4452
02:19:45,343 --> 02:19:46,411
JANUARY 2016 WHEN YOU RECEIVE 

4453
02:19:46,411 --> 02:19:47,178
THE TEXT OR EMAIL? 

4454
02:19:47,178 --> 02:19:48,713
BUT IF THAT IS THE DATE, I WILL 

4455
02:19:48,713 --> 02:19:49,314
STIPULATE TO THAT. 

4456
02:19:49,314 --> 02:19:50,849
>> WE WILL TAKE THAT AS A 

4457
02:19:50,849 --> 02:19:51,282
STUPID RATION. 

4458
02:19:51,282 --> 02:19:52,283
HAS EXAMINER EVER ACCUSED OF 

4459
02:19:52,283 --> 02:19:53,017
USING COUNTERMEASURES DURING A 

4460
02:19:53,017 --> 02:19:53,685
POLYGRAPH AND -- 

4461
02:19:53,685 --> 02:19:54,085
>> NO. 

4462
02:19:54,085 --> 02:19:55,520
>> YOU HAVE RECEIVED EMAIL AND 

4463
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,287
STABILITY TO THE POLYGRAPH OUT 

4464
02:19:56,287 --> 02:19:57,389
OF SCOPE IN JANUARY 2016. 

4465
02:19:57,389 --> 02:19:58,590
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, HOW LONG WAS 

4466
02:19:58,590 --> 02:19:59,591
YOUR POLYGRAPH OUT OF SCOPE? 

4467
02:19:59,591 --> 02:20:01,426
>> I DON'T KNOW I RECALL IT IS 

4468
02:20:01,426 --> 02:20:02,227
THE PENULTIMATE, SECOND TO THE 

4469
02:20:02,227 --> 02:20:03,962
LAST I HAD WAS WHEN I WAS A 

4470
02:20:03,962 --> 02:20:04,696
SUPERVISOR AT THE WASHINGTON 

4471
02:20:04,696 --> 02:20:05,663
FIELD OFFICE WHICH WOULD HAVE 

4472
02:20:05,663 --> 02:20:07,065
OCCURRED BETWEEN THE 2008 AND 

4473
02:20:07,065 --> 02:20:07,265
2011. 

4474
02:20:07,265 --> 02:20:08,433
MY UNDERSTANDING OF OUT OF 

4475
02:20:08,433 --> 02:20:09,534
SCOPE FOR THE FBI MEANS THAT 

4476
02:20:09,534 --> 02:20:10,368
POLYGRAPHS HAVE A FIVE-YEAR 

4477
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:11,502
SPAN OF EFFECTIVENESS OR 

4478
02:20:11,502 --> 02:20:21,713
VALIDITY. 

4479
02:20:21,713 --> 02:20:23,014
WE HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE AND WE 

4480
02:20:23,014 --> 02:20:23,715
ARE TRYING TO INCLUDE, 

4481
02:20:23,715 --> 02:20:24,682
INCLUDING ME TRYING TO GET 

4482
02:20:24,682 --> 02:20:25,583
RIGHT INTO A PARTICULAR 

4483
02:20:25,583 --> 02:20:26,116
INTELLIGENCE COMPARTMENT. 

4484
02:20:26,116 --> 02:20:27,385
THEY RAN THE NAMES, ME AND SOME 

4485
02:20:27,385 --> 02:20:28,386
OTHERS OUT OF SCOPE WHICH 

4486
02:20:28,386 --> 02:20:30,188
HAPPENS BECAUSE POLYGRAPHS ARE 

4487
02:20:30,188 --> 02:20:31,489
-- THE LINE FOR POLYGRAPHS IS 

4488
02:20:31,489 --> 02:20:31,722
LONGER. 

4489
02:20:31,722 --> 02:20:33,024
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM IN 

4490
02:20:33,024 --> 02:20:34,025
THE MILITARY I UNDERSTAND THE 

4491
02:20:34,025 --> 02:20:35,693
LINE FOR POLYGRAPH AND THE 

4492
02:20:35,693 --> 02:20:35,926
DELAYS. 

4493
02:20:35,926 --> 02:20:54,712
YOU HAPPENED TO HOLD A JOB THAT 

4494
02:20:54,712 --> 02:20:55,413
IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE. 

4495
02:20:55,413 --> 02:20:56,448
THE QUESTION IS, I WOULD ASSUME 

4496
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,382
TO ANSWER YOUR EVASIVENESS, YOU 

4497
02:20:57,382 --> 02:20:58,917
DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG YOU WERE 

4498
02:20:58,917 --> 02:21:00,018
OUT OF SCOPE YES OR NO? 

4499
02:21:00,018 --> 02:21:00,652
BUT THAT IS. 

4500
02:21:00,652 --> 02:21:01,753
I WAS TRYING TO RECANT. 

4501
02:21:01,753 --> 02:21:03,488
>> YES OR NO DO YOU KNOW HOW 

4502
02:21:03,488 --> 02:21:04,489
LONG YOU ARE OUT OF SCOPE? 

4503
02:21:04,489 --> 02:21:05,557
>> I DO NOT. 

4504
02:21:05,557 --> 02:21:06,624
>> WHAT STEPS WERE TAKEN TO 

4505
02:21:06,624 --> 02:21:07,459
BRING YOU INTO SCOPE? 

4506
02:21:07,459 --> 02:21:08,760
BUT I WENT AND HAD A POLYGRAPH. 

4507
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,028
>> WAS THIS AFTER THE JANUARY 

4508
02:21:10,028 --> 02:21:10,995
16 LETTER THAT YOU RECEIVED? 

4509
02:21:10,995 --> 02:21:11,996
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 

4510
02:21:11,996 --> 02:21:12,296
AFTERWARDS. 

4511
02:21:12,296 --> 02:21:13,831
>> IF YOU ARE OUT OF SCOPE, THE 

4512
02:21:13,831 --> 02:21:15,266
LAST TIME, WHEN WAS THE LAST 

4513
02:21:15,266 --> 02:21:16,167
TIME THAT YOU ACCESS CLASSIFIED 

4514
02:21:16,167 --> 02:21:16,501
INFORMATION? 

4515
02:21:16,501 --> 02:21:17,402
>> NIGHT BEFORE LAST PREPARING 

4516
02:21:17,402 --> 02:21:17,702
FOR THIS. 

4517
02:21:17,702 --> 02:21:18,769
>> YOU CURRENTLY HAVE WHAT 

4518
02:21:18,769 --> 02:21:19,136
CLASSIFICATION? 

4519
02:21:19,136 --> 02:21:20,572
BUT I HAVE THE TOP-SECRET 

4520
02:21:20,572 --> 02:21:22,140
CLEARANCE WITH SOME FCI 

4521
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:22,473
COMPARTMENTS. 

4522
02:21:22,473 --> 02:21:23,741
>> DURING THE TIME THAT YOU 

4523
02:21:23,741 --> 02:21:25,076
WERE OUT OF SCOPE, DID YOU HAVE 

4524
02:21:25,076 --> 02:21:25,676
ACCESS TO SEI? 

4525
02:21:25,676 --> 02:21:25,976
MAKE YES. 

4526
02:21:25,976 --> 02:21:28,079
>> ARE YOU AWARE THAT IT IS FBI 

4527
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:29,280
PROCEDURE THAT A FAILURE OR OUT 

4528
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:44,095
OF SCOPE POLYGRAPH DOES NOT 

4529
02:21:44,095 --> 02:21:44,929
DETERMINE A TOP-SECRET BUT A 

4530
02:21:44,929 --> 02:21:45,930
FAILURE OF THIS WOULD REQUIRE 

4531
02:21:45,930 --> 02:21:47,532
YOU TO BE READ OUT OF SEI 

4532
02:21:47,532 --> 02:21:48,166
ACCESS ALTHOUGH YOU COULD 

4533
02:21:48,166 --> 02:21:49,300
MAINTAIN YOUR TOP-SECRET AND 

4534
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:50,502
THIS WAS A DIRECT ANSWER FROM A 

4535
02:21:50,502 --> 02:21:51,603
QUESTION THAT I POSED AND WAS 

4536
02:21:51,603 --> 02:21:52,804
RECEIVED WITHIN THE LAST WEEK. 

4537
02:21:52,804 --> 02:21:53,972
WERE YOU AWARE THAT YOU SHOULD 

4538
02:21:53,972 --> 02:21:55,239
HAVE BEEN READ OUT OF ANY SCI 

4539
02:21:55,239 --> 02:21:56,474
INFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF 

4540
02:21:56,474 --> 02:21:57,942
SCOPE ? BUT I BELIEVE YOU USED 

4541
02:21:57,942 --> 02:21:59,310
THEM WORD FAILURE AND I WAS NOT 

4542
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:00,945
AWARE OF THE FACT THAT AN OUT 

4543
02:22:00,945 --> 02:22:01,746
OF SCOPE POLYGRAPH REQUIRED A 

4544
02:22:01,746 --> 02:22:07,919
READOUT OF SCI.  

4545
02:22:07,919 --> 02:22:09,387
>> I ACCEPT THAT BUT I WANT TO 

4546
02:22:09,387 --> 02:22:10,521
GO BACK TO THE QUESTION. 

4547
02:22:10,521 --> 02:22:11,522
THE ANSWER CAME BACK FROM THE 

4548
02:22:11,522 --> 02:22:12,891
FBI AND JUSTICE ITSELF,  THAT 

4549
02:22:12,891 --> 02:22:14,025
IT WAS -- THAT IS THE 

4550
02:22:14,025 --> 02:22:14,325
PROCEDURE. 

4551
02:22:14,325 --> 02:22:15,393
THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS, 

4552
02:22:15,393 --> 02:22:21,933
AFTER THE 26 -- YOU DID THE 

4553
02:22:21,933 --> 02:22:22,700
POLYGRAPH AT WHAT TIME? 

4554
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:24,168
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE OUT OF 

4555
02:22:24,168 --> 02:22:25,403
SCOPE AND PRODDED BY GIVEN A 

4556
02:22:25,403 --> 02:22:26,337
POLYGRAPH AND WHEN WAS THAT? 

4557
02:22:26,337 --> 02:22:27,405
MacRI REGULATION IS A 2016 

4558
02:22:27,405 --> 02:22:28,406
TIMEFRAME BUT AFTER THAT EMAIL, 

4559
02:22:28,406 --> 02:22:29,974
I DO NOT KNOW WITHIN A MONTH OR 

4560
02:22:29,974 --> 02:22:30,675
TWO I THINK. 

4561
02:22:30,675 --> 02:22:32,377
>> ARE YOU AWARE IN THE 

4562
02:22:32,377 --> 02:22:34,646
PUBLICLY STATED VERSION THAT 

4563
02:22:34,646 --> 02:22:35,480
THERE HAS BEEN SERIOUS 

4564
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:36,280
QUESTIONS AND ISSUES CONCERNING 

4565
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:37,115
POLYGRAPH INFORMATION AND LACK 

4566
02:22:37,115 --> 02:22:46,891
OF POLYGRAPH PROCEDURES AT THE 

4567
02:22:46,891 --> 02:22:47,892
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FBI 

4568
02:22:47,892 --> 02:22:49,160
THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT BY THE 

4569
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:49,593
INSPECTOR GENERAL? 

4570
02:22:49,593 --> 02:22:51,029
>> I AM NOT -- GENERALLY AWARE 

4571
02:22:51,029 --> 02:22:52,563
THAT THERE WAS A REPORT BUT I'M 

4572
02:22:52,563 --> 02:22:56,434
NOT AWARE OF THE CONCLUSIONS. 

4573
02:22:56,434 --> 02:22:57,702
>> ONE OF THE GENERAL CONCERNS 

4574
02:22:57,702 --> 02:22:59,103
ON THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE 

4575
02:22:59,103 --> 02:23:00,471
OUT OF SCOPE AND THIS IS THE 

4576
02:23:00,471 --> 02:23:01,573
ANSWER COMING BACK FROM THE 

4577
02:23:01,573 --> 02:23:02,473
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU 

4578
02:23:02,473 --> 02:23:03,808
SHOULD HAVE BEEN READ OUT OF 

4579
02:23:03,808 --> 02:23:04,008
SCI. 

4580
02:23:04,008 --> 02:23:05,143
MY CONCERN IS IT,  DURING THIS 

4581
02:23:05,143 --> 02:23:06,144
TIMEFRAME YOU WERE INVOLVED IN 

4582
02:23:06,144 --> 02:23:07,812
TWO VERY HIGH PROFILE WHAT 

4583
02:23:07,812 --> 02:23:15,553
WOULD HAVE BEEN GETTING READY 

4584
02:23:15,553 --> 02:23:16,721
FOR A SCI INFORMATION AT WHICH 

4585
02:23:16,721 --> 02:23:17,955
YOU WERE NOT READ OUT OF. 

4586
02:23:17,955 --> 02:23:18,956
THIS IS A CONCERN. 

4587
02:23:18,956 --> 02:23:19,791
IS NOTHING ELSE FROM THAT 

4588
02:23:19,791 --> 02:23:20,992
QUESTION BUT I HAVE NO FURTHER 

4589
02:23:20,992 --> 02:23:21,292
QUESTIONS. 

4590
02:23:21,292 --> 02:23:22,627
I AM FINISHED AND I YIELD BACK. 

4591
02:23:22,627 --> 02:23:23,861
>> I THINK THAT YOU MISSTATED 

4592
02:23:23,861 --> 02:23:24,262
THE CONCLUSION. 

4593
02:23:24,262 --> 02:23:25,697
I THINK THAT YOU SAID THAT -- 

4594
02:23:25,697 --> 02:23:27,131
'S BACK MR. STRZOK. 

4595
02:23:27,131 --> 02:23:29,133
SPENT FAILURE TO REQUIRED 

4596
02:23:29,133 --> 02:23:30,168
READOUT AND THAT IS NOT 

4597
02:23:30,168 --> 02:23:30,468
CONCLUDED. 

4598
02:23:30,468 --> 02:23:31,368
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA 

4599
02:23:31,368 --> 02:23:31,969
CONTROLS THE TIME. 

4600
02:23:31,969 --> 02:23:32,937
>> THE TIME IS OVER. 

4601
02:23:32,937 --> 02:23:34,138
THE TIME IS UP. 

4602
02:23:34,138 --> 02:23:34,638
>> MAY I RESPOND? 

4603
02:23:34,638 --> 02:23:35,773
BUT THERE WAS NO QUESTION. 

4604
02:23:35,773 --> 02:23:36,607
FROM THE DEPARTMENT  OF 

4605
02:23:36,607 --> 02:23:38,142
JUSTICE, I READ YOU THE ANSWER. 

4606
02:23:38,142 --> 02:23:39,744
>> MAY I COMMENT TO WHAT I 

4607
02:23:39,744 --> 02:23:40,311
BELIEVE IS A MISSTATEMENT? 

4608
02:23:40,311 --> 02:23:41,546
>> FROM YOUR ANSWER, WHEN I 

4609
02:23:41,546 --> 02:23:43,381
TOOK THAT TO BE IS IN THE EVENT 

4610
02:23:43,381 --> 02:23:50,688
OF A FAILURE, AN INDIVIDUAL 

4611
02:23:50,688 --> 02:23:51,656
SHOULD BE READ OUT. 

4612
02:23:51,656 --> 02:23:52,590
YOU ARE CONFLATING THAT WITH 

4613
02:23:52,590 --> 02:23:53,825
OUT OF SCOPE OR A FAILURE. 

4614
02:23:53,825 --> 02:23:55,126
IT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 

4615
02:23:55,126 --> 02:23:55,993
OUT OF SCOPE REQUIRES SOMEBODY 

4616
02:23:55,993 --> 02:23:56,961
TO BE READ OUT. 

4617
02:23:56,961 --> 02:23:57,428
IT MAY BE. 

4618
02:23:57,428 --> 02:24:00,031
IAM NOT A SECURITY 

4619
02:24:00,031 --> 02:24:03,234
PROFESSIONAL BUT YOU UP HERE. 

4620
02:24:03,234 --> 02:24:04,769
>> YOU ARE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE 

4621
02:24:04,769 --> 02:24:05,770
ANSWER THAT WE RECEIVED FROM 

4622
02:24:05,770 --> 02:24:06,671
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND 

4623
02:24:06,671 --> 02:24:07,905
THAT IS THE ANSWER THAT YOU 

4624
02:24:07,905 --> 02:24:09,307
GAVE THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN OUT 

4625
02:24:09,307 --> 02:24:10,608
OF SYNC IN THE QUESTION NOW 

4626
02:24:10,608 --> 02:24:11,442
BECOMES, IS POLICIES AND 

4627
02:24:11,442 --> 02:24:12,210
PROVISIONS FAILED OR NOT? 

4628
02:24:12,210 --> 02:24:13,377
THIS IS A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION 

4629
02:24:13,377 --> 02:24:14,612
IF YOU ARE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN 

4630
02:24:14,612 --> 02:24:15,046
READ OUT. 

4631
02:24:15,046 --> 02:24:16,214
THAT IS MY FINAL ANSWER, 

4632
02:24:16,214 --> 02:24:29,527
STATEMENT, NOT A QUESTION, NOT 

4633
02:24:29,527 --> 02:24:30,328
-- I YIELD BACK. 

4634
02:24:30,328 --> 02:24:31,396
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM RHODE 

4635
02:24:31,396 --> 02:24:31,896
ISLAND IS RECOGNIZED. 

4636
02:24:31,896 --> 02:24:33,297
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I LOOK FORWARD 

4637
02:24:33,297 --> 02:24:34,532
TO A COUPLE OF EXTRA MINUTES AS 

4638
02:24:34,532 --> 02:24:35,433
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAVE 

4639
02:24:35,433 --> 02:24:35,633
HAD. 

4640
02:24:35,633 --> 02:24:36,367
SERVING ON THIS COMMITTEE, 

4641
02:24:36,367 --> 02:24:37,468
REPRESENTING -- THIS IS BEEN 

4642
02:24:37,468 --> 02:24:38,669
ONE OF THE GREATEST HONORS OF 

4643
02:24:38,669 --> 02:24:40,037
MY LIFE BUT THE CONDUCT OF THIS 

4644
02:24:40,037 --> 02:24:41,372
COMMITTEE TODAY HAS BEEN FOR ME 

4645
02:24:41,372 --> 02:24:42,005
TREMENDOUSLY SAD, EMBARRASSING, 

4646
02:24:42,005 --> 02:24:42,840
AND REALLY DANGEROUS TO OUR 

4647
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:43,207
DEMOCRACY. 

4648
02:24:43,207 --> 02:24:44,675
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR 

4649
02:24:44,675 --> 02:24:45,676
THE WAY THAT YOUR BEEN TREATED 

4650
02:24:45,676 --> 02:24:46,344
BY THIS COMMITTEE. 

4651
02:24:46,344 --> 02:24:47,578
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE 

4652
02:24:47,578 --> 02:24:49,414
WATCHING, YOU OUGHT NOT WONDER 

4653
02:24:49,414 --> 02:24:50,648
WHY THEY HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE 

4654
02:24:50,648 --> 02:24:51,849
IN CONGRESS AND ARE SICK OF THE 

4655
02:24:51,849 --> 02:24:52,817
CIRCUS THAT THEY SAW BEING 

4656
02:24:52,817 --> 02:24:54,018
CONDUCTED IN THIS ROOM TODAY. 

4657
02:24:54,018 --> 02:24:55,052
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON URGENT 

4658
02:24:55,052 --> 02:25:16,808
ISSUES LIKE FAMILY SEPARATION, 

4659
02:25:16,808 --> 02:25:17,775
REASONABLE EFFORTS TO REDUCE 

4660
02:25:17,775 --> 02:25:18,442
GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR 

4661
02:25:18,442 --> 02:25:18,975
COMMUNITIES, CONSIDERING 

4662
02:25:18,975 --> 02:25:19,610
LEGISLATION TO REFORM OUR 

4663
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:20,210
BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, 

4664
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:21,112
PASSING LEGISLATION TO REDUCE 

4665
02:25:21,112 --> 02:25:22,079
THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, 

4666
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:22,980
ADDRESSING THE INABILITY OF 

4667
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:23,981
AMERICANS WHO FALL BEHIND IN 

4668
02:25:23,981 --> 02:25:24,816
THEIR STUDENT LOANS TO 

4669
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:25,616
DISCHARGE THAT DEBT AND 

4670
02:25:25,616 --> 02:25:26,717
BANKRUPTCY OR OVERSIGHT OF THE 

4671
02:25:26,717 --> 02:25:27,552
MANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND 

4672
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:28,152
CORRUPTION IN THIS 

4673
02:25:28,152 --> 02:25:29,087
ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE HAVING 

4674
02:25:29,087 --> 02:25:29,987
YET ANOTHER HEARING ON THE 

4675
02:25:29,987 --> 02:25:30,587
HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS. 

4676
02:25:30,587 --> 02:25:31,689
WHAT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND, MR. 

4677
02:25:31,689 --> 02:25:33,024
STRZOK, IS THE REASON THAT MY 

4678
02:25:33,024 --> 02:25:33,724
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WILL NOT 

4679
02:25:33,724 --> 02:25:34,992
LET YOU ANSWER A QUESTION IS 

4680
02:25:34,992 --> 02:25:36,027
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED 

4681
02:25:36,027 --> 02:25:36,594
IN YOUR ANSWERS. 

4682
02:25:36,594 --> 02:25:37,928
THIS IS ABOUT PROMOTING A 

4683
02:25:37,928 --> 02:25:44,035
NARRATIVE. 

4684
02:25:44,035 --> 02:25:45,803
YOU ARE BEING A -- YOU ARE A 

4685
02:25:45,803 --> 02:25:47,105
PROP SO THAT THEY CAN PROMOTE A 

4686
02:25:47,105 --> 02:25:48,005
NARRATIVE IN AN ONGOING EFFORT 

4687
02:25:48,005 --> 02:25:49,073
TO DISTRACT FROM THE SERIOUS 

4688
02:25:49,073 --> 02:25:49,974
INVESTIGATION OF THE SPECIAL 

4689
02:25:49,974 --> 02:25:51,175
COUNSEL THAT IS CLOSING IN ON 

4690
02:25:51,175 --> 02:25:52,210
THE DONALD TRUMP INNER CIRCLE. 

4691
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:52,910
THIS IS A CAMPAIGN. 

4692
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:53,911
TO UNDERMINE THAT WORK AND 

4693
02:25:53,911 --> 02:25:54,745
SADLY DOING WHATEVER IS 

4694
02:25:54,745 --> 02:26:03,821
NECESSARY TO DO IT WITH -- IN 

4695
02:26:03,821 --> 02:26:04,622
CONCERT WITH THE PRESIDENT 

4696
02:26:04,622 --> 02:26:05,623
ATTACKED THE FBI AND THE 

4697
02:26:05,623 --> 02:26:06,157
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 

4698
02:26:06,157 --> 02:26:07,358
UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND 

4699
02:26:07,358 --> 02:26:08,693
SO YOUR EMAILS ARE A PERFECT 

4700
02:26:08,693 --> 02:26:13,130
FOIL FOR THIS EFFORT. 

4701
02:26:13,130 --> 02:26:14,131
THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 

4702
02:26:14,131 --> 02:26:15,032
HEARING YOUR CONTACTS AND 

4703
02:26:15,032 --> 02:26:16,100
EXPLANATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT 

4704
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:16,467
ABOUT YOU. 

4705
02:26:16,467 --> 02:26:17,335
IT IS ABOUT PROTECTING THE 

4706
02:26:17,335 --> 02:26:17,735
PRESENT. 

4707

WHAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT HAS 

4719
02:26:33,851 --> 02:26:34,117
CHANGED? 

4720
02:26:34,117 --> 02:26:34,518
19 INDICTMENTS. 

4721
02:26:34,518 --> 02:26:35,086
FIVE GUILTY PLEAS.

4729
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:47,665
I DO. 

4730
02:26:47,665 --> 02:26:48,699

CONCLUSIONS. 

4734
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:04,048
WE FIND THE DECISIONS MADE WERE 

4735
02:27:04,048 --> 02:27:04,882
CONSISTENT WITH THE ANALYTIC 

4736
02:27:04,882 --> 02:27:05,550
APPROACH DESCRIBED ABOVE. 

4737
02:27:05,550 --> 02:27:06,551

DECISIONS WORTHY OF ALL IS A 

4739
02:27:07,919 --> 02:27:08,419

4740
02:27:08,419 --> 02:27:09,520
JUDGMENTS MADE BY THE AGE OF

02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:10,621
AND PROSECUTORS AND THAT THEY 

4742
02:27:10,621 --> 02:27:11,154

SO IT IS -- THERE IS A BIG 

4744
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:14,058

HE ALSO SAID THAT YOUR 

4889
02:30:34,892 --> 02:30:36,093
EXPLANATION FOR HOW YOU HANDLED 

4890
02:30:36,093 --> 02:30:46,303
THE ANTHONY WEINER LAPTOP -- 

4891
02:30:46,303 --> 02:30:47,538
DELAYED AND YOU DID NOT TAKE 

4892
02:30:47,538 --> 02:30:47,938
ACTION INITIALLY. 

4893
02:30:47,938 --> 02:30:48,872
HE SAID THAT YOUR EXPLANATION 

4894
02:30:48,872 --> 02:30:50,474
FOR THAT AS HE DID NOTE THAT IN 

4895
02:30:50,474 --> 02:30:51,475
THE REPORT WAS NOT PERSUASIVE. 

4896
02:30:51,475 --> 02:30:52,510
YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT. 

4897
02:30:52,510 --> 02:30:54,244
>> I AM AWARE OF THE FACTS 

4898
02:30:54,244 --> 02:30:55,146
REBUTTING THAT HE HAS REBUTTING 

4899
02:30:55,146 --> 02:30:55,679
THAT SPECIFIC ASSERTION. 

4900
02:30:55,679 --> 02:30:56,580
SMACKING TESTIFIED TO US THAT 

4901
02:30:56,580 --> 02:30:57,915
HE WAS NOT PERSUADED BY YOUR 

4902
02:30:57,915 --> 02:30:58,248
EXPLANATION. 

4903
02:30:58,248 --> 02:30:59,450
FOR WHY YOU FOCUSED ON THE 

4904
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:00,151
DONALD TRUMP AND RUSSIA 

4905
02:31:00,151 --> 02:31:01,185
COLLUSION AND YOU LET THE 

4906
02:31:01,185 --> 02:31:02,319
WEINER THINGS SIT AND THAT HE 

4907
02:31:02,319 --> 02:31:03,287
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF OUR 

4908
02:31:03,287 --> 02:31:04,221
COMMITTEE THAT IT WAS 

4909
02:31:04,221 --> 02:31:05,156
REASONABLE TO INFER THAT YOUR 

4910
02:31:05,156 --> 02:31:06,256
ACTIONS INVOLVING WEINER'S 

4911
02:31:06,256 --> 02:31:10,628
LAPTOP, THE FACT THAT YOU DID 

4912
02:31:10,628 --> 02:31:11,662
NOT PURSUE THAT, AGGRESSIVELY, 

4913
02:31:11,662 --> 02:31:12,763
THAT IT IS REASONABLE FOR YOU 

4914
02:31:12,763 --> 02:31:14,165
TO INFER THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF 

4915
02:31:14,165 --> 02:31:23,273
THE BIAS THAT YOU EVINCED IN 

4916
02:31:23,273 --> 02:31:23,807
THOSE TEXT MESSAGES. 

4917
02:31:23,807 --> 02:31:24,808
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT? 

4918
02:31:24,808 --> 02:31:26,277
MECH NOT SPECIFIC TO THAT BUT I 

4919
02:31:26,277 --> 02:31:26,944
WILL ACCEPT YOUR 

4920
02:31:26,944 --> 02:31:27,311
REPRESENTATION. 

4921
02:31:27,311 --> 02:31:28,512
>> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO 

4922
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:29,780
SHOW THAT WHILE THE REPORT SAID 

4923
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:30,681
THAT THE CLINTON CHARGING 

4924
02:31:30,681 --> 02:31:31,749
DECISION WAS NOT DUE TO BIAS. 

4925
02:31:31,749 --> 02:31:33,450
HE SAID THAT  THE WEINER IS 

4926
02:31:33,450 --> 02:31:34,518
ABSOLUTELY A FAIR GAME TO INFER 

4927
02:31:34,518 --> 02:31:35,719
THAT, AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY 

4928
02:31:35,719 --> 02:31:36,319
ARE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE 

4929
02:31:36,319 --> 02:31:37,220
THE GENESIS OF THIS RUSSIA 

4930
02:31:37,220 --> 02:31:37,721
INTERFERENCE CASE. 

4931
02:31:37,721 --> 02:31:38,856
DO YOU ALSO KNOW THAT ROD 

4932
02:31:38,856 --> 02:31:40,291
ROSENSTEIN ON JUNE 28 WHEN HE 

4933
02:31:40,291 --> 02:31:41,525
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF THIS 

4934
02:31:41,525 --> 02:31:48,399
COMMITTEE, HE SAID THAT YOU 

4935
02:31:48,399 --> 02:31:49,433
WERE BIASED ARE YOU AWARE OF 

4936
02:31:49,433 --> 02:31:49,633
THAT? 

4937
02:31:49,633 --> 02:31:50,434
MECH I AM NOT. 

4938
02:31:50,434 --> 02:31:51,468
>> RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION, 

4939
02:31:51,468 --> 02:31:52,870
YES, HE DID, AND HE ALSO SAID 

4940
02:31:52,870 --> 02:31:57,741
THAT THE BIAS THAT YOU EVINCED 

4941
02:31:57,741 --> 02:31:58,943
DOES UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF 

4942
02:31:58,943 --> 02:31:59,543
YOUR INVESTIGATIVE ACTIONS. 

4943
02:31:59,543 --> 02:32:00,578
IT CAUSES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

4944
02:32:00,578 --> 02:32:01,378
TO LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE 

4945
02:32:01,378 --> 02:32:01,711
INSTITUTION. 

4946
02:32:01,711 --> 02:32:03,114
DO YOU KNOW THAT HE SAID THAT? 

4947
02:32:03,114 --> 02:32:03,814
MECH I DO NOT. 

4948
02:32:03,814 --> 02:32:04,682
>> HE DID.  

4949
02:32:04,682 --> 02:32:06,083
I JUST -- THE IDEA THAT THERE 

4950
02:32:06,083 --> 02:32:07,918
IS NO BIAS IS NOT -- I DO NOT 

4951
02:32:07,918 --> 02:32:08,819
THINK THAT YOUR EXPLANATIONS 

4952
02:32:08,819 --> 02:32:09,520
HAVE BEEN CREDIBLE. 

4953
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:12,156
I THINK THAT IF YOU ACTED SO 

4954
02:32:12,156 --> 02:32:23,133
APPROPRIATELY, MUELLER -- 

4955
02:32:23,133 --> 02:32:24,034
ROBERT MUELLER REMOVED YOU FROM 

4956
02:32:24,034 --> 02:32:25,436
THE TEAM AND YOU ARE IN HUMAN 

4957
02:32:25,436 --> 02:32:26,537
RESOURCES WHICH IS A DIMENSION. 

4958
02:32:26,537 --> 02:32:27,838
YOU ARE NOW ONE OF THE SUBJECTS 

4959
02:32:27,838 --> 02:32:28,872
OF AN ONGOING IG INVESTIGATION. 

4960
02:32:28,872 --> 02:32:29,206
>> NO. 

4961
02:32:29,206 --> 02:32:30,474
>>> YOUR CONDUCT IS NOT BEING 

4962
02:32:30,474 --> 02:32:31,442
REVIEWED BY HORWITZ ABOUT WHAT 

4963
02:32:31,442 --> 02:32:33,244
YOU DID OR DID NOT DO IN THE 

4964
02:32:33,244 --> 02:32:33,677
RUSSIAN COLLUSION? 

4965
02:32:33,677 --> 02:32:34,979
MECH I AM UNAWARE OF BEING THE 

4966
02:32:34,979 --> 02:32:35,713
SUBJECT OF AN ONGOING 

4967
02:32:35,713 --> 02:32:36,080
INVESTIGATION. 

4968
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:36,914
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

4969
02:32:36,914 --> 02:32:42,520
YOU OPENED UP THE 

4970
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:42,953
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 

4971
02:32:42,953 --> 02:32:43,554
INVESTIGATION ON 31 JULY. 

4972
02:32:43,554 --> 02:32:44,755
WAS THAT BECAUSE OF THE GEORGE 

4973
02:32:44,755 --> 02:32:45,288
PAPADOPOULOS INFORMATION? 

4974
02:32:45,288 --> 02:32:49,360
>> SIR, I CANNOT GET INTO THE 

4975
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:50,461
GUIDANCE THAT THE FBI HAS 

4976
02:32:50,461 --> 02:32:51,462
PROVIDED ME ABOUT ANSWERS THAT 

4977
02:32:51,462 --> 02:32:51,996
I CAN PROVIDE. 

4978
02:32:51,996 --> 02:32:53,430
THAT GETS INTO A LEVEL OF 

4979
02:32:53,430 --> 02:32:54,431
DETAIL THAT I CANNOT I HAVE 

4980
02:32:54,431 --> 02:32:55,232
BEEN DIRECTED NOT TO. 

4981
02:32:55,232 --> 02:32:56,700
>> YOU HAVE ANSWERED SOME 

4982
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:00,704
QUESTIONS. 

4983
02:33:00,704 --> 02:33:02,206
THIS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF 

4984
02:33:02,206 --> 02:33:02,539
CONVENIENCE. 

4985
02:33:02,539 --> 02:33:03,140
YOU HAVE ANSWERED QUESTIONS 

4986
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:04,208
ABOUT THEIR HIS GRAVE CONCERNS 

4987
02:33:04,208 --> 02:33:05,576
AND ALL OF THIS STUFF ABOUT WHY 

4988
02:33:05,576 --> 02:33:06,577
YOU ARE DOING IT. 

4989
02:33:06,577 --> 02:33:08,178
YOU DID NOT DO THAT. 

4990
02:33:08,178 --> 02:33:08,511
THE DOSSIER. 

4991
02:33:08,511 --> 02:33:09,813
WAS THE DOSSIER A PART OF WHY 

4992
02:33:09,813 --> 02:33:11,048
YOU OPEN UP THE INVESTIGATION? 

4993
02:33:11,048 --> 02:33:11,315
>> NO. 

4994
02:33:11,315 --> 02:33:13,918
NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN 

4995
02:33:13,918 --> 02:33:32,670
CONVENIENCE. 

4996
02:33:32,670 --> 02:33:33,804
THIS IS BASED ON WHAT THE 

4997
02:33:33,804 --> 02:33:34,939
DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED OUT WITH 

4998
02:33:34,939 --> 02:33:35,839
THE CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE ABOUT 

4999
02:33:35,839 --> 02:33:36,840
WHAT IS PERMITTED AND THAT. 

5000
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:38,142
IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE -- 

5001
02:33:38,142 --> 02:33:39,476
>> THE DOSSIER WAS NOT A PART 

5002
02:33:39,476 --> 02:33:40,110
OF THAT. 

5003
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:40,577
THAT IS IMPORTANT. 

5004
02:33:40,577 --> 02:33:41,779
WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT THE 

5005
02:33:41,779 --> 02:33:42,913
DOSSIER WAS FUNDED BY HILLARY 

5006
02:33:42,913 --> 02:33:43,547
CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATIC 

5007
02:33:43,547 --> 02:33:43,780
PARTY? 

5008
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:45,516
MECH I CANNOT -- I DO NOT THINK 

5009
02:33:45,516 --> 02:33:46,317
THAT IS AN ACCURATE 

5010
02:33:46,317 --> 02:33:47,251
REPRESENTATION AND THE FBI 

5011
02:33:47,251 --> 02:33:48,285
DIRECTED ME NOT TO ANSWER THE 

5012
02:33:48,285 --> 02:33:49,253
QUESTION BASED ON --'S BACK 

5013
02:33:49,253 --> 02:33:49,687
RIGHT. 

5014
02:33:49,687 --> 02:33:50,888
HILLARY AND THE DNC WENT TO 

5015
02:33:50,888 --> 02:33:51,488
FUSION WHO PAID --,. 

5016
02:33:51,488 --> 02:33:52,523
IT WAS A POLITICAL DOCUMENT. 

5017
02:33:52,523 --> 02:33:52,790
CORRECT? 

5018
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:54,158
MECH THE LATTER IS CLOSER TO I 

5019
02:33:54,158 --> 02:33:54,758
CANNOT COMMENT. 

5020
02:33:54,758 --> 02:33:55,993
THE FBI HAS DIRECTED ME TO NOT 

5021
02:33:55,993 --> 02:33:56,593
ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

5022
02:33:56,593 --> 02:33:58,295
>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT 

5023
02:33:58,295 --> 02:33:59,430
THE DOSSIER -- WHAT WOULD YOU 

5024
02:33:59,430 --> 02:33:59,830
CHOOSE? 

5025
02:33:59,830 --> 02:34:01,498
IS IT A POLITICAL DOCUMENT? 

5026
02:34:01,498 --> 02:34:16,880
IS IT LEGITIMATE INTELLIGENCE? 

5027
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:18,115
>> I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO 

5028
02:34:18,115 --> 02:34:19,015
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. 

5029
02:34:19,015 --> 02:34:20,351
I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED BY THE FBI 

5030
02:34:20,351 --> 02:34:21,719
THAT I MIGHT NOT GET INTO THE 

5031
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:22,352
BASIN OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 

5032
02:34:22,352 --> 02:34:22,786
OR EQUITIES. 

5033
02:34:22,786 --> 02:34:23,787
>> HERE'S THE ISSUE THAT I 

5034
02:34:23,787 --> 02:34:25,322
THINK WE HAVE WE SEE THE BIAS 

5035
02:34:25,322 --> 02:34:25,823
THAT YOU DID. 

5036
02:34:25,823 --> 02:34:26,857
YOUR EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY YOU 

5037
02:34:26,857 --> 02:34:27,758
SAID WHAT YOU DID. 

5038
02:34:27,758 --> 02:34:28,759
THEY REALLY ARE NOT CREDIBLE. 

5039
02:34:28,759 --> 02:34:30,094
WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE 

5040
02:34:30,094 --> 02:34:31,328
GENESIS OF WHY OPEN UP A 

5041
02:34:31,328 --> 02:34:31,761
COUTERINTELLIGENCE 

5042
02:34:31,761 --> 02:34:32,295
INVESTIGATION AGAINST THE 

5043
02:34:32,295 --> 02:34:32,862
OPPOSING PARTY'S CAMPAIGN? 

5044
02:34:32,862 --> 02:34:34,198
I AM WITH YOU ABOUT FOCUSING ON 

5045
02:34:34,198 --> 02:34:35,199
RUSSIA AND HOLDING THEM 

5046
02:34:35,199 --> 02:34:35,532
ACCOUNTABLE. 

5047
02:34:35,532 --> 02:34:36,600
YOU TRIED TO ROPE IN THE OTHER 

5048
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:37,000
PARTY'S NOMINEE. 

5049
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,469
THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF BIAS. 

5050
02:34:38,469 --> 02:34:39,803
WE CAN GET ANSWERS TO THE 

5051
02:34:39,803 --> 02:34:40,471
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE 

5052
02:34:40,471 --> 02:34:41,638
GENESIS OF ANY OF THIS WISE. 

5053
02:34:41,638 --> 02:34:42,439
LET ME FINISH. 

5054
02:34:42,439 --> 02:34:43,173
MAY 18, CHAIRMAN GOWDY 

5055
02:34:43,173 --> 02:34:44,308
MENTIONED YOU SAY, MY CONCERN 

5056
02:34:44,308 --> 02:34:45,542
IS THAT THERE IS NO BIG THERE 

5057
02:34:45,542 --> 02:34:45,775
THERE. 

5058
02:34:45,775 --> 02:34:47,211
THIS HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR AT 

5059
02:34:47,211 --> 02:34:47,745
LEAST 10 MONTHS. 

5060
02:34:47,745 --> 02:34:49,713
I THINK IT WAS GOING ON BEFORE 

5061
02:34:49,713 --> 02:34:53,150
JULY 31. 

5062
02:34:53,150 --> 02:34:54,251
THERE YOU ARE, ROBERT MUELLER'S 

5063
02:34:54,251 --> 02:34:55,019
APPOINTED, AND YOU CANNOT 

5064
02:34:55,019 --> 02:34:55,919
IDENTIFY ANY REASON TO SUSPECT 

5065
02:34:55,919 --> 02:34:56,887
THAT THERE WAS COLLUSION 

5066
02:34:56,887 --> 02:34:57,554
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN 

5067
02:34:57,554 --> 02:34:57,921
AND RUSSIA. 

5068
02:34:57,921 --> 02:34:59,256
THERE WAS NO BIG THERE THERE 

5069
02:34:59,256 --> 02:34:59,757
AFTER 10 MONTHS. 

5070
02:34:59,757 --> 02:35:01,258
SO THAT IS THE BIG CONCERN IS 

5071
02:35:01,258 --> 02:35:02,293
THAT SOMEBODY LIKE YOU WHO 

5072
02:35:02,293 --> 02:35:09,199
SAID, WELL, STOP HIM. 

5073
02:35:09,199 --> 02:35:10,000
WE NEEDED INSURANCE POLICY. 

5074
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:10,501
YOU LET THAT BUYS. 

5075
02:35:10,501 --> 02:35:11,535
YOU WANTED THERE TO BE 

5076
02:35:11,535 --> 02:35:11,968
SOMETHING THERE. 

5077
02:35:11,968 --> 02:35:13,203
YOU WANTED IT TO BE TRUE. 

5078
02:35:13,203 --> 02:35:14,238
THAT, I THINK IS INFLUENCING 

5079
02:35:14,238 --> 02:35:14,571
YOUR ACTIONS. 

5080
02:35:14,571 --> 02:35:15,773
YOU CAN PROVE US WRONG BY 

5081
02:35:15,773 --> 02:35:16,774
PROVIDING US INFORMATION I 

5082
02:35:16,774 --> 02:35:17,641
WOULD LIKE INFORMATION ON ANY 

5083
02:35:17,641 --> 02:35:18,208
TYPE OF INFORMANTS. 

5084
02:35:18,208 --> 02:35:18,809
BEFORE JULY 31. 

5085
02:35:18,809 --> 02:35:20,077
I WOULD LIKE THE INFORMATION ON 

5086
02:35:20,077 --> 02:35:35,592
WHAT YOU USED TO OPERA -- OPEN 

5087
02:35:35,592 --> 02:35:36,727
UP THE INVESTIGATION BUT I WANT 

5088
02:35:36,727 --> 02:35:37,728
TO KNOW WHETHER THAT WAS 

5089
02:35:37,728 --> 02:35:38,562
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE VAULT OR 

5090
02:35:38,562 --> 02:35:39,997
IF IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE STATE 

5091
02:35:39,997 --> 02:35:40,297
DEPARTMENT. 

5092
02:35:40,297 --> 02:35:41,498
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IF WE 

5093
02:35:41,498 --> 02:35:42,666
JUST PUT THOSE OUT AND ANSWER 

5094
02:35:42,666 --> 02:35:44,435
THEM, THEN A LOT OF US WOULD BE 

5095
02:35:44,435 --> 02:35:45,702
ABLE TO THEN MAKE, I THINK, THE 

5096
02:35:45,702 --> 02:35:46,637
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN MAKE A 

5097
02:35:46,637 --> 02:35:46,904
JUDGMENT. 

5098
02:35:46,904 --> 02:35:48,372
I'M GOING OVER MY TIME AND I 

5099
02:35:48,372 --> 02:35:48,772
YIELD BACK. 

5100
02:35:48,772 --> 02:35:49,673
>>  THE NEXT QUESTION. 

5101
02:35:49,673 --> 02:35:49,940
BRIEFLY. 

5102
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:53,943
>> SIR, TO THE WHY I CANNOT 

5103
02:35:53,943 --> 02:35:55,179
EXPLAIN WHY A CASE WOULD BE 

5104
02:35:55,179 --> 02:35:56,647
OPEN, I DO NOT THINK THAT IS 

5105
02:35:56,647 --> 02:35:56,914
ACCURATE. 

5106
02:35:56,914 --> 02:35:58,114
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIRECTOR'S 

5107
02:35:58,114 --> 02:35:58,916
STATEMENT WHEN THE DEPARTMENT 

5108
02:35:58,916 --> 02:35:59,983
OF JUSTICE AUTHORIZED HIM TO 

5109
02:35:59,983 --> 02:36:01,485
SAY THAT THEY HAD OPEN THE CASE 

5110
02:36:01,485 --> 02:36:02,553
AND TO ALLEGATIONS THAT THE 

5111
02:36:02,553 --> 02:36:03,954
GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA HAD MADE 

5112
02:36:03,954 --> 02:36:26,844
AN OFFER OF ASSISTANCE IN THE 

5113
02:36:26,844 --> 02:36:27,478
POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT OF 

5114
02:36:27,478 --> 02:36:28,379
MEMBERS OF THE DONALD TRUMP 

5115
02:36:28,379 --> 02:36:29,480
CAMPAIGN, I CANNOT ENVISION A 

5116
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:30,514
SCENARIO WHERE THAT WOULD NOT 

5117
02:36:30,514 --> 02:36:31,582
BE A REASONABLE PREDICATION TO 

5118
02:36:31,582 --> 02:36:32,115
OPEN AN INVESTIGATION. 

5119
02:36:32,115 --> 02:36:32,816
>> IT IS PAPADOPOULOS. 

5120
02:36:32,816 --> 02:36:34,017
THAT IS NOT QUITE WHAT THEY 

5121
02:36:34,017 --> 02:36:34,284
HAD. 

5122
02:36:34,284 --> 02:36:35,753
YOU DID NOT QUITE GET THERE BUT 

5123
02:36:35,753 --> 02:36:36,854
I KNOW THAT JAMES COMEY MAY 

5124
02:36:36,854 --> 02:36:38,255
HAVE SAID THAT BUT YOU DID NOT 

5125
02:36:38,255 --> 02:36:38,756
GET THERE. 

5126
02:36:38,756 --> 02:36:39,390
IT IS PAPADOPOULOS. 

5127
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:39,923
THAT IS WEAK. 

5128
02:36:39,923 --> 02:36:40,991
>> I THINK THAT THE 

5129
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:41,725
CHARACTERIZATION WAS THAT IT 

5130
02:36:41,725 --> 02:36:42,726
WAS A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF 

5131
02:36:42,726 --> 02:36:43,727
INFORMATION STANDS ON HIS UPPER 

5132
02:36:43,727 --> 02:36:44,761
ANYBODY IN THIS COMMITTEE WOULD 

5133
02:36:44,761 --> 02:36:46,230
NOT ARGUE THAT, ONE, IT WAS NOT 

5134
02:36:46,230 --> 02:36:47,297
APPROPRIATE TO OPEN THAT AND, 

5135
02:36:47,297 --> 02:36:48,699
TWO, THAT IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY 

5136
02:36:48,699 --> 02:36:48,865
-- 

5137
02:36:48,865 --> 02:36:49,933
>> WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT IF 

5138
02:36:49,933 --> 02:36:50,968
IT WAS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE WE 

5139
02:36:50,968 --> 02:36:51,901
DO NOT KNOW THE INFORMATION. 

5140
02:36:51,901 --> 02:36:53,470
WE READ IT IN THE NEW YORK 

5141
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:54,471
TIMES FROM LEAKS BECAUSE IS 

5142
02:36:54,471 --> 02:36:55,372
PAPADOPOULOS SAID IN A BAR. 

5143
02:36:55,372 --> 02:36:56,306
>> THE TIME HAS EXPIRED. 

5144
02:36:56,306 --> 02:36:57,341
>> THAT IS THE REASON. 

5145
02:36:57,341 --> 02:36:57,975
>>> REGULAR ORDER. 

5146
02:36:57,975 --> 02:36:58,775
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 

5147
02:36:58,775 --> 02:36:59,042
CHAIRMAN. 

5148
02:36:59,042 --> 02:37:00,477
>> THERE IS A SECOND ELEMENT OF 

5149
02:37:00,477 --> 02:37:01,445
THE QUESTION. 

5150
02:37:01,445 --> 02:37:02,646
>> NO. 

5151
02:37:02,646 --> 02:37:03,814
YOU RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT 

5152
02:37:03,814 --> 02:37:04,982
WHETHER OR NOT I AGREED WITH 

5153
02:37:04,982 --> 02:37:05,916
INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT I HAD 

5154
02:37:05,916 --> 02:37:07,351
ACTED IN A WAY THAT WAS BIASED. 

5155
02:37:07,351 --> 02:37:08,719
>> YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

5156
02:37:08,719 --> 02:37:09,052
ANSWER THAT? 

5157
02:37:09,052 --> 02:37:09,786
MAY I DID NOT. 

5158
02:37:09,786 --> 02:37:11,021
>> THE GENTLEMAN FROM  ILLINOIS 

5159
02:37:11,021 --> 02:37:25,068
IS RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES. 

5160
02:37:25,068 --> 02:37:26,737
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND

CUOMO AND CNN REGARDING UCONN 

5166

HIS CLIENT. 

5167
02:37:31,474 --> 02:37:32,876
ON FOX NEWS THEY TALK ABOUT HIM 

5168
02:37:32,876 --> 02:37:33,977
AS THE CENTER OF THIS ANTI-

5169
02:37:33,977 --> 02:37:34,912
DONALD TRUMP THAT WAS 

5170
02:37:34,912 --> 02:37:35,512
DETERMINED TO THROW THE 

5171
02:37:35,512 --> 02:37:36,513
ELECTION AGAINST DONALD TRUMP  

5172
02:37:36,513 --> 02:37:37,981
NONE OF THIS HAS A SHRED OF 

5173
02:37:37,981 --> 02:37:39,249
TRUTH DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS 

5174
02:37:39,249 --> 02:37:39,549

RUSSIA INCLUSION INVESTIGATION 

5181
02:37:45,455 --> 02:37:46,623
THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM QUOTE 

5182
02:37:46,623 --> 02:37:47,758
UNQUOTE WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY 

5183
02:37:47,758 --> 02:37:49,359
TO PREVENT LEAKS AND ACTIVELY 

5184
02:37:49,359 --> 02:37:57,568
ENSURED THAT NEWS REPORTS DID 

5185
02:37:57,568 --> 02:37:58,602
NOT OVERPLAY THE SERIOUSNESS OF 

5186
02:37:58,602 --> 02:37:59,035
THE INVESTIGATION. 

5187
02:37:59,035 --> 02:37:59,837
IS THAT TRUE? 

5188
02:37:59,837 --> 02:38:00,070

OTHERS. 

5193
02:38:03,807 --> 02:38:05,142
>> LEAKS ARE TERRIBLE. 

5194
02:38:05,142 --> 02:38:18,021
THEY UNDERCUT THINGS IN A 

5195
02:38:18,021 --> 02:38:18,822
VARIETY OF WAYS. 

5196
02:38:18,822 --> 02:38:19,489
THEY CAN UPEND INVESTIGATIONS. 

5197
02:38:19,489 --> 02:38:20,624
THEY CAN LEAD TO INCORRECT 

5198
02:38:20,624 --> 02:38:20,957
ASSUMPTIONS. 

5199
02:38:20,957 --> 02:38:21,658
THEY CAN LET WITNESSES AND 

5200
02:38:21,658 --> 02:38:22,893
SUBJECTS KNOW THAT THEY ARE BE 

5201
02:38:22,893 --> 02:38:23,293
INVESTIGATED. 

5202
02:38:23,293 --> 02:38:24,161
THEY CAN LEAD TO WILD 

5203
02:38:24,161 --> 02:38:25,195
SPECULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF 

5204
02:38:25,195 --> 02:38:25,929

PEOPLE BEYOND THE MIDYEAR TEAM 

5218
02:38:46,283 --> 02:38:47,551

PEOPLE BEYOND THE MIDYEAR TEAM. 

5230

BETTER CHANCE THAT IT LEAKS OUT 

5250
02:39:48,145 --> 02:39:52,449
SOMEHOW. 

5251
02:39:52,449 --> 02:39:53,483
THESE CONCERNS ARE NOT SPECIFIC 

5252

TO NEW YORK. 

5253
02:39:54,117 --> 02:39:54,651
>>> OKAY. 

5254
02:39:54,651 --> 02:39:56,086
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS. 

5255
02:39:56,086 --> 02:40:03,727
IN A REPORT IN THAT SAME 

5256
02:40:03,727 --> 02:40:04,528
REPORT, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

5257
02:40:04,528 --> 02:40:05,328

QUOTE UNQUOTE, HE, REFERRING TO 

5262
02:40:15,372 --> 02:40:17,074
JAMES COMEY SAID, IT IS CLEAR 

5263
02:40:17,074 --> 02:40:18,275
TO ME THAT THERE IS A CADRE OF 

5264
02:40:18,275 --> 02:40:19,543
SENIOR PEOPLE IN NEW YORK WHO 

5265
02:40:19,543 --> 02:40:20,711
HAVE A DEEP HATRED OF SECRETARY 

5266
02:40:20,711 --> 02:40:21,912
CLINTON AND HE SAID, IT IS 

5267
02:40:21,912 --> 02:40:22,579
QUOTE UNQUOTE DEEP. 

5268
02:40:22,579 --> 02:40:27,084
WERE YOU AWARE OF THIS CONCERN? 

5269
02:40:27,084 --> 02:40:27,984
>> I WAS AWARE OF OTHER

REPORTING OF SOME PEOPLE

EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERN. 

5273
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:30,654
YES. 

5274
02:40:30,654 --> 02:40:31,855

5275
02:40:31,855 --> 02:40:32,755
DIRECTOR COMEY? 

5276
02:40:32,755 --> 02:40:36,126

5277
02:40:36,126 --> 02:40:36,393
CONCERN? 

5278
02:40:36,393 --> 02:40:36,559
YES. 

5279
02:40:36,559 --> 02:40:37,761
ú>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME  

5280
02:40:37,761 --> 02:40:38,995
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND HOW 

5281
02:40:38,995 --> 02:40:40,731
THAT IN YOUR VIEW AFFECTED THE 

5282
02:40:40,731 --> 02:40:45,802
REVELATION OF THE WARRANT FOR 

5283
02:40:45,802 --> 02:40:46,202
WEINER'S LAPTOP? 

5284
02:40:46,202 --> 02:40:50,941
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK 

5285
02:40:50,941 --> 02:40:51,341
DIRECTOR COMEY. 

5286
02:40:51,341 --> 02:40:52,442
I THINK THAT THERE WAS 

5287
02:40:52,442 --> 02:40:52,742
DISCUSSION. 

5288
02:40:52,742 --> 02:40:53,577
I REMEMBER PRACTICALLY SOME OF 

5289
02:40:53,577 --> 02:40:57,881
IT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF 

5290
02:40:57,881 --> 02:41:05,055
REPORTING FROM MR. GIULIANI AND 

5291
02:41:05,055 --> 02:41:05,589

CONNECTIONS TO NEW YORK. 

5293
02:41:06,389 --> 02:41:08,124
BUT AGAIN, I DO NOT WANT TO 

5294
02:41:08,124 --> 02:41:08,892
SCAPEGOAT NEW YORK BECAUSE A 

5295
02:41:08,892 --> 02:41:10,260
LOT OF PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF IT 

5296
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:11,294
AND THERE WERE CONCERNS JUST 

5297
02:41:11,294 --> 02:41:13,096
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS, BUT 

5298
02:41:13,096 --> 02:41:14,431
WITH REGARD TO MR. COMEY, MY 

5299
02:41:14,431 --> 02:41:15,465
RECOLLECTION IS THAT HE WAS 

5300
02:41:15,465 --> 02:41:16,767
AWARE OF THE CONCERNS BUT I WAS 

5301
02:41:16,767 --> 02:41:17,801
NOT PRIVY TO DISCUSSIONS THAT 

5302
02:41:17,801 --> 02:41:18,969

THE GUY HIMSELF HAS IDENTIFIED 

5429

HIMSELF. 

5430
02:45:41,331 --> 02:45:41,998
WE ALL KNOW WHO IT IS. 

5431
02:45:41,998 --> 02:45:42,966
AND, THE OTHER NAME IS SIMPSON.

WONDERING HOW THE DOSSIER GOT 

5434

TO OHR, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, 

5435
02:45:47,804 --> 02:45:49,672
IF IT GOT TO THE FBI THROUGH  

5436
02:45:49,672 --> 02:45:52,008
MEDIA SOURCES, NOT JUST THROUGH 

5437
02:45:52,008 --> 02:45:52,441
CHRISTOPHER STEELE. 

5438
02:45:52,441 --> 02:45:55,745
OF COURSE, WE KNOW NELLY OHR

THE WHOLE TIME. 

5443
02:46:00,283 --> 02:46:00,850
YOU HAVE NEVER HAD 

5444
02:46:00,850 --> 02:46:03,219

5447
02:46:05,889 --> 02:46:08,458
