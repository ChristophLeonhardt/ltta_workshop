1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:00,450
MIDDLEMAN.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,818
WE WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS TO

3
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:03,053
PASS LEGISLATION THAT WILL SAVE

4
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:10,060
AMERICANS EVEN MORE MONEY AT THE

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,427
PHARMACY.

6
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,796
>> Bret: THE PRESIDENT FOCUSSED

7
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:13,496
DOMESTICALLY TO GET

8
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:14,764
PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES DOWN.

9
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:20,203
HOW TO DO THAT IS THE QUESTION.

10
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:22,539
INCREASED COMPETITION AND GIVE

11
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,875
MEDICARE PART-D PLANS BETTER

12
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,577
TOOLS TO NEGOTIATE FOR SENIOR

13
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:30,647
CITIZENS AND OPTIONS TO LOWER

14
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:33,516
PATIENT'S OUT OF POCKET

15
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:33,883
SPENDINGS.

16
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:37,053
YOU HAVE THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

17
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:39,689
IN THE U.S. APPROVED.

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,659
AND 328-BILLION DOLLARS SPENT ON

19
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:42,959
DRUGS.

20
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,096
49% OF AMERICANS HAVE USED A

21
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:48,198
PRESCRIPTION DRUG IN THE LAST 30

22
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:49,032
DAYS.

23
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,901
AMAZING STATS.

24
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:52,402
OUR PANEL.

25
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:59,275
STEVE HAYS, KAREN AND MOLLY.

26
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,910
KAREN, AMBITIOUS FOR THE

27
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,679
PRESIDENT TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD.

28
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,847
WE HAVE SEEN OTHER

29
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:05,181
ADMINISTRATIONS TRY TO DO IT.

30
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:08,985
>> HE BACKED OFF OF HIS CAMPAIGN

31
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,221
PROMISE WHICH WAS TO HAVE

32
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:13,189
MEDICARE NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH

33
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,925
THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR

34
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:16,259
PRICES.

35
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,695
THAT WAS THE HOW WITSER OF THIS

36
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,263
AND HE DECIDED NOT TO FIRE.

37
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:23,833
IT IT'S SIGNIFICANT AFTER THIS

38
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:28,171
WAS ANNOUNCED THE STOCK PRICES

39
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,739
OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

40
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,474
WENT UP.

41
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:34,110
>> Bret: PART OF THIS.

42
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,914
THE SECRETARY SAID YOU HAVE

43
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:38,248
ADJUST.

44
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:41,718
>> THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE TIME

45
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,920
THAT EVERYBODY SPENDS WATCH DRUG

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,256
COMPANY ADS ON TV AND HOW MUCH

47
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,558
INFORMATION COMPANIES ARE

48
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,493
REQUIRED TO PUT THEM IN.

49
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:53,463
WHY NOT HAVE THEM DISCLOSE THEIR

50
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,599
PRICES IN THE ADS TO?

51
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:04,574
>> Bret: HE IS SAYING TRANCE

52
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,575
PAIRENCY ON PRICES?

53
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,110
>> YES, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO

54
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,977
NEW REGULATION.

55
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:10,380
THE POINT ABOUT THE STOCK

56
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,483
MARKET -- IT WASN'T JUST DRUG

57
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:16,019
COMPANIES BUT THE PHARMACY

58
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,020
BENEFIT MANAGERS.

59
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,088
THEIR STOCKS WENT UP.

60
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:21,090
THE PLAN DOES GET MORE GENERICS

61
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,559
INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

62
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,794
THAT'S KEY FOR LOWERING THE

63
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,664
PRICES AND THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL

64
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:27,997
THING.

65
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,699
THE REST IS SHARING AMONG THE

66
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,166
GROUPS.

67
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:34,437
WHO GETS ALL OF THIS MONEY?

68
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:38,675
YOU NEED DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT.

69
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,978
IT WILL BE LESS ROBUST THAN

70
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:42,412
TALKED ABOUT.

71
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,813
>> Bret: THERE ARE SOME THINGS

72
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:45,682
THEY CAN DO OUTSIDE OF CONGRESS.

73
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,650
>> OH, SURE.

74
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,221
HHS HAS A LOT OF POWER.

75
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,322
THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENTS

76
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:52,856
ARE BROAD.

77
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,424
YOU LISTED THE GOALS.

78
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,026
A LOT WILL DEPEND ON HOW THEY

79
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:58,928
ROLL IS OUT.

80
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,564
ON THE MATTER OF RECRUITING

81
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,599
DEMOCRATS, WHAT THE PRESIDENT

82
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,869
DID WAS TAKE A STEP AWAY FROM

83
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,837
HIS CAMPAIGN RHETORIC.

84
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:12,041
THIS IS A LESS POPULACE PLAN.

85
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,978
IT'S IN LINE WITH WHAT A

86
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:15,745
TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT

87
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:16,713
MIGHT OFFER.

88
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,281
THAT WILL MAKE IT LESS

89
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,183
ATTRACTIVE TO DEMOCRACY IN

90
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:23,019
CONGRESS BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS

91
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,355
GOVERNMENT CENTRIC.

92
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,290
>> Bret: THE RUSSIAN

93
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,324
INVESTIGATION.

94
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,326
THE MICHAEL COHEN PART.

95
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:31,861
PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY HAS A

96
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,730
CONTRACT WITH AT&T.

97
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,233
THEY HIRED HIM JANUARY THROUGH

98
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,968
DECEMBER.

99
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,738
$50,000 PER MONTH TO PROVIDE

100
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:44,173
CONSULTING SERVICES TIED TO THE

101
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,675
TIME-WARNER DEAL.

102
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:48,778
THE HEAD OF AT&T TOLD EMPLOYEES

103
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,313
IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

104
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:56,619
>> HE WAS THE SECOND CEO TO

105
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,088
APOLOGIZE FOR HIRING MICHAEL

106
00:03:59,088 --> 00:03:59,455
COHEN.

107
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:01,057
THE OTHER WAS A DRUG COMPANY.

108
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,692
IT'S NOT THAT THIS IS ILLEGAL.

109
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,761
IT'S VERY MUCH BUSINESS AS USUAL

110
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,230
THIS WASHINGTON.

111
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,765
IT'S JUST THE INFLUENCE OF THE

112
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:09,432
INDUSTRY IS THERE.

113
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:13,069
IT'S NEW PLAYERS IN IT.

114
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,570
IT'S UMP SEEMLY.

115
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,839
-- UNSEEMLY.

116
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,641
THESE ARE THE KIND OF DEALS THAT

117
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,043
CORPORATIONS HATE TO HAVE OUT IN

118
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:20,510
THE OPEN.

119
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,983
>> THEN THEY SHOULD NOT DO THEM.

120
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,751
LOOK, THIS CUTS AGAINST -- THEY

121
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:32,322
WANT TO MAKE THEIR BEST

122
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,156
ARGUMENTS.

123
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,824
THIS CUTS AGAINST THE HEART OF

124
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,025
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN

125
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:36,592
MESSAGE.

126
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,728
HE WAS GOING TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.

127
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:39,729
THIS IS THE SWAMP.

128
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,698
IT'S THE SWAMP ONLY SWAMPIER.

129
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,334
THAT'S WHY THIS IS A POLITICAL

130
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,303
PROBLEM FOR THE PRESIDENT.

131
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:48,338
FOR PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED THE

132
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:51,140
PRESIDENT BECAUSE I AM SICK OF

133
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,607
WASHINGTON, D.C.

134
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,977
EVERYBODY IS SCRATCHING

135
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:55,278
EVERYBODY'S BACKS WITH PAY OFFS

136
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:56,679
AND KICKBACKS.

137
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,880
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

138
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,614
>> Bret: I WANT TO REWIND.

139
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:02,919
IT STARTED WITH A LOT OF FOCUS

140
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,655
ON THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH TIED TO

141
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:06,789
ONE OF THE COMPANIES.

142
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:09,459
THE COMPANY DENIED HE WAS

143
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,361
FUNDING IT FOR THE MONTHEY MADE

144
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,863
IT TO MICHAEL COHEN.

145
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:15,765
WHAT ABOUT WHERE THAT RUSSIA

146
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:16,966
PART OF IT STANDS?

147
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,234
>> FIRST IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING

148
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:26,209
THAT THE REASON THIS IS BEING

149
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,345
DISCUSSED IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A

150
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:29,746
LEAK.

151
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,881
IT'S A CRIMINAL LEAK.

152
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,917
THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH

153
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,053
LEAKS FROM INVESTIGATIONS.

154
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,221
THE PROBLEM WITH THESE AMOUNTS

155
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,922
IS THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF

156
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,624
GOVERNMENT IS SO BIG.

157
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:44,360
IF YOU WANT TO DRAIN THE SWAMP,

158
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,462
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SIZE

159
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:47,130
OF GOVERNMENT.

160
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,265
EVERYONE IS ACTING LIKE TOTALLY

161
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,968
SURPRISED THIS IS HAPPENING,

162
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,735
IT'S SILLY.

163
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,804
AS FOR THE TRYING TO LINK TO

164
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:57,373
THIS TO THE RUSSIAN

165
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,608
INVESTIGATION, IT'S INTERESTING

166
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,443
THAT AVANATI WAS TRYING TO LINK

167
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,678
IT TO RUSSIA AND SUGGESTED THIS

168
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:05,114
INFORMATION IS PART OF THE

169
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,050
LARGER MESSAGE ABOUT RUSSIA.

170
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,186
I DON'T THINK THAT CASE WAS MADE

171
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:13,623
WELL EXCEPT RUSSIA HAS GLOBAL

172
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,191
INTERESTS AND MIGHT HAVE DISTANT

173
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,626
TIES TO SOME COMPANIES.

174
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,094
>> Bret: THE NUNES PART AND WHAT

175
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,763
THEY ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF THE

176
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:21,731
DOJ YET?

177
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,266
>> WELL, AT THIS POINT, IT'S

178
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,202
BEEN INTERESTING THAT THE WHITE

179
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:30,773
HOUSE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

180
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,742
JUSTICE ARE ON THE SAME SIDE.

181
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:35,144
WE DON'T SEE THEM IN THAT

182
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,913
POSITION THAT OFTEN.

183
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,182
THE HILL WILL PUSH THE

184
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,083
REPUBLICANS FOR THIS SOURCE TO

185
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,119
BE REVEALED.

186
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:45,321
THE QUESTION IS GOING TO BE --

187
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,823
ONCE THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS

188
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,157
THAT THIS SOURCE IS ALSO

189
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,159
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN

190
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,993
COOPERATING WITH THE MUELLER

191
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,761
INVESTIGATION, WHETHER WE WILL

192
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,596
CONTINUE TO SEE THIS UNITED

193
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:53,896
FRONT.

194
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:57,400
>> THAT'S WHAT WAS SO

195
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,369
INTERESTING THIS DEPARTMENT OF

196
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:01,838
JUST LEAK TO THE "WASHINGTON

197
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,138
POST."

198
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,506
THEY HAVE A SOURCE WHO PROVIDES

199
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,542
INFORMATION TO THE CIA AND THE

200
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,277
FBI WHO WAS GETTING INFORMATION

201
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:10,246
FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO

202
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,280
DEVELOP THIS RUSSIAN STORY.

203
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,482
THAT'S A HUGE STORY.

204
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,083
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE DEPARTMENT

205
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,819
OF JUSTICE LEAKED THAT TO THE

206
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:17,320
"WASHINGTON POST."

207
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,421
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO THE PERSON

208
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:18,788
IS.

209
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:22,058
THIS IS A NEW LAYER THAT IS

210
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,259
DEFINITELY GOING TO COME OUT ONE

211
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,827
WAY OR OTHER.

212
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,762
I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY WILL BE

213
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:31,033
SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING THIS A

214
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:31,367
SECRET.

215
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,238
>> YOU HEAR THE ARGUMENT WE

216
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,306
CAN'T PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION

217
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,842
TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT

218
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:40,576
JEOPARDIZED THE INVESTIGATION.

219
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,044
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S THE

220
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,579
CASE IN THIS PARTICULAR

221
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:43,946
INSTANCE.

222
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:44,547
IT'S INTERESTING.

223
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,150
THERE HAVE BEEN LEAKS ON BOTH

224
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,251
SIDE.

225
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,585
OBVIOUS GOVERNMENT LEAKS AND

226
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,854
PART OF THE REASON WE KNOW MORE

227
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:54,323
ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE ORIGIN

228
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:57,193
LEAK IS THERE ARE COUNTER-LEAKS.

229
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:59,629
YOU HAVE TO BE UPSET ABOUT LEAKS

230
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,296
ON BOTH SIDES.

231
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:01,597
>> Bret: HOW LONG DO YOU THINK

232
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:04,200
IT TAKES BEFORE MUELLER WRAPS UP

233
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,034
THIS PROBE?

234
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,069
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY.

235
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,304
I WOULD SAY 6 MONTHS.

236
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:11,140
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO DEPEND

237
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,176
ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO

238
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,444
NEGOTIATE WHETHER THE PRESIDENT

239
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:18,014
GETS SUBPOENAED OR GOES AND

240
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:18,381
TESTIFIED.

241
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:21,784
>> HE DIDN'T WANT IT TO GO PAST

242
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:24,153
THE MID-TERMS.

243
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:24,921
MUELLER DOESN'T.

244
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,256
>> ONCE YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO THE

245
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,324
MID-TERMS, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO

246
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:29,091
THAT EITHER.

247
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,260
>> THERE IS A LOT ABOUT THE

248
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,995
MUELLER PROBE THAT IS INTERESTED

249
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,464
IN SAVING FACE FOR THE NIB.

250
00:08:35,464 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THAT.
