shockingly we have good news on the Isis front so I'm gonna go to Reuters hear us back militias raised a flag inside Raqqa Stadium on Tuesday at Reuters witness said as a four month battle to take the Islamic state Syrian capital came to an end we got him we actually got it okay now let me temper that a little bit okay yeah it's not over over it's not like Isis is away from the planet and it's not exactly we but yes Rocco was definitely their capital and losing Raqqa is a gigantic blow to Isis so it is really good news so as Reuters explains the context Raqqa was the first big city Islamic state captured in early 2014 before its rapid series of victories in Iraq and Syria brought millions of people under the rule of its self-declared caliphate which passed laws and issued passports and money now like they say there's a form of battles the militias that took it were mainly Kurdish but definitely Arab militias in there as well and they celebrated together so was a coalition but together and did they have a u.s. help yes they did so let's give you details on how they won the stadium and Hospital became the last major positions held by the Islamic state after the departure of some of his fighters on Sunday leaving only foreign jihadists to mount a last stand and they did and they lost and they were mainly killed but some also driven out but the SDF that is a collection of Syrian militia that won the battle here that we support has been supported by a us-led international coalition with airstrikes as special forces on the ground since it started the battle for Raqqa City in early June look all this is complicated and there's a an incredible amount of different militias with different interests inside Syria I've been a proponent of using special forces more and good to see the special forces seem to have at least helped here in this case you know airstrikes is is a look again it's there's it's not a black and white issue but it's a little bit more difficult because it's more imprecise and leads to more civilian deaths which oftentimes makes it harder to win but with special forces you could be more directed and obviously they were directed correctly here okay but we didn't do most of the fighting at all overwhelming chair of the fighting was done by the actual Kurdish and Arab militias and now the SDF advance since Sunday also brought it control over a central city roundabout where Islamic state was displayed the severed heads of its enemies and which became one of the last lines of defense as the battle progressed so look I read a number of accounts of what happened inside Raqqa when the Islamic state controlled it and it was all horrific and so this is great news but understand that there are a number of factors that led into it so first of all if you want to give Donald Trump credit I'm not gonna bread you that he's the president right now and and so to whatever degree he continued the policies that were in place already good at least he didn't change him he could have screwed him up it's Donald Trump but he didn't now am i colouring it by saying he didn't change the policies well so let me give you the two sides of it in terms of the overall strategy Donald Trump never made a public statement about change strategy and there was internal reporting which I gave to you on another episode of The Young Turks saying they didn't know what to say cuz the strategy was the same as Obama's so Trump was just waiting around to see if he could put a different twist on it but they never got around to doing that because it's the same strategy but you know what if you want to say they increased bombings of civilians which Trump authorized helped you know you'd have to look more into the details I don't think increased bombing of civilians ever helped but they did take Raqqa and the only change that Trump made to any of the strategies that were already happening on the ground was to allow for more latitude in the bombings which means yes it's okay to kill more civilians so I'm just telling you the whole reality of what happened here so war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Islamic state was now completely cleared from the city so more good news and and one last overall context here is la McStay has lost swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq this year as Reuters reports including its most prized possession Mosul and in Syria it has been forced back into a strip of the Euphrates valley and a surrounding desert so they lost the biggest city they had in Mosul they lost their capital in Raqqa they've lost a lot of the oil fields and hence a source of their revenue and and now they're starting yet surrounded and and and their territories dwindling and their powers dwindling so part of it was a strategy that we executed along with the fighters inside Syria and Iraq and including the Iraqi government rock is a Syria but Mosul's in Iraq and they were in both countries and part of it was that their reign was so brutal that the locals were oftentimes happy to help us now again it's very complicated it's that's not a black-and-white issues and some of the locals were in different directions but overall the stories I read from places like Roco were that people couldn't wait for liberation from Isis and so it appears today they have gotten that liberation and no matter what the reason was and which side you're on that is great news for the planet help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
