>> Martha: HURRICANE MICHAEL
STILL BLASTING FLORIDA WITH
100-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS NOW AND
HEAVY RAINS THROUGHOUT THE AREA.
THE STATE IS BRACING FOR THE
WORSE BUT HOPING FOR THE BEST.
TONIGHT, IT'S TOO SOON TO KNOW
HOW BAD THE DAMAGES OR IF LIVES
WERE LOST AT THIS POINT.
AS WE JUST HEARD FROM PAM BONDI,
FOLKS WILL TRY TO GET IN
TOMORROW MORNING AND WHATEVER
RESCUES THEY CAN, BUT EARLY
SUGGESTIONS, ALREADY SUGGESTING
THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY DAMAGE
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 13 AND
$19 BILLION, THROUGHOUT THIS
WHOLE AREA.
FOR RIGHT NOW, RON DeSANTIS IS
IN JACKSONVILLE ABOUT 200 MILES
FROM THE HIGH OF THIS STORM WITH
THE LATEST ON THE HURRICANE AND
ALSO HIS BID TO TAKE THE
GOVERNOR'S MANSION.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR.
WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE
HURRICANE'S RESPONSE AND HOW
THIS IS ALL BEING HANDLED?
>> I THINK IN FLORIDA WE HAVE A
GREAT CADRE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
FIRST RESPONDERS AND A VARIETY
OF DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT THIS IS
ONE WAY WHERE, IF YOU ARE GOING
TO DO IT IN FLORIDA, YOU HAVE TO
BE PREPARED TO REACT TO THESE
STORMS.
I THINK THEY HAVE TYPICALLY DONE
A GREAT JOB AND ALL HANDS ARE ON
DECK RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS    IT WAS NOT A STORM TA
THIS IS    IT WAS NOT A STORM TT
THIS IS    IT WAS NOT A STORM TA
WEEK AGO PEOPLE WERE REALLY
PAYING ATTENTION TO.
EVEN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO, WE
KNEW SOMETHING WAS HAPPEN BUT
THE FACT THAT IT MATURED SO
QUICKLY INTO A CATEGORY OF FOUR,
I THINK OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A
LOT OF DAMAGE THAT IS BEING DONE
IN TERMS OF THE LOSS OF LIFE.
I THINK THE QUESTION WILL BE,
HOW MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T HEED THE
CALL TO EVACUATE, AND ARE THEY
ABLE TO HUNKER DOWN SAFELY OR
NOT?
I KNOW THOSE FIRST RESPONDERS
WILL BE ON THE SCENE IN
PANAMA CITY BEACH AND ELSEWHERE,
TRYING TO SAVE LIVES.
>> Martha: AND HOW WILL YOU
REACT?
YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A
CAMPAIGN?
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE
SOME HEAT FOR CONTINUING THIS
FUND-RAISER AND A RALLY THAT HE
IS DOING IN ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA,
TONIGHT, SO WHAT HAS YOU ARE
BEEN?
>> Rep. DeSANTIS: WE
CANCELED OUR FUND-RAISERS AND WE
HAD PUBLIC RALLY SCHEDULED FOR
YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND WE
CONVERTED THOSE INTO SUPPLY
DRIVES.
WE HAD RENTED A U-HAUL AND WE
HAD PEOPLE COME AND BRING WATER
AND NONPERISHABLE FOOD, BABY
SUPPLIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
WE'VE BEEN LOADING UP THE TRUCK,
AND THEN WHAT WE WILL DO IS ONCE
THE STORM PASSES AND PEOPLE GET
A SENSE OF WHAT'S NEEDED ON THE
GROUND, WE WILL DRIVE THAT TO
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INN
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INR
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INH
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INE
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INT
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INF
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INO
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INI
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INA
IT'S NEEDED.
THAT'S THE BEST WAY WE CAN HELP
THE EFFORT.
>> Martha: IT VERY HELPFUL.
LOOKING AT THE POLLS, ANDREW
GILLUM IS NOW UP BY ABOUT 3.7%
IN THE REAL CLEAR AVERAGE OF THE
POLLS.
THESE PROMISING MEDICARE FOR ALL
IN FLORIDA, AND A $15 MINIMUM
WAGE IS A PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE
AND HE'S DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB
AT FUND-RAISING.
I THINK IT'S GOT MORE MONEY THAN
YOU DO AT THIS POINT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE REASON
THAT YOU ARE BEHIND RIGHT NOW?
>> WELL, THESE ELECTIONS, PEOPLE
START TO FOCUS I THINK AROUND
THIS TIME.
I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET ON
THE DEBATES STAGE TOGETHER VERY
SOON.
I WELCOME FOX NEWS, YOU END UP
BREAD TO DO ONE IN THE GENERAL
LIKE YOU DID IN THE PRIMARY, AND
WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
REALLY SHOW THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE TWO CANDID
CANDIDATES.
I WOULD STAY TUNED ON THIS RACE,
AND WE GOT THE MOMENTUM.
>> A WHILE BACK, WE TALKED ABOUT
YOU TEACHING YOUR KIDS ABOUT
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
YOU CAME OUT IN LATE SEPTEMBER
AND SAID, I AM MY OWN MAN, WHEN
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE HURRICANE
RESPONSE IN PUERTO RICO.
IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO
WIN THE RACE?
>> IF YOU SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT
LIKE I   I HAVE ON A LOT OF KEY
ISSUES, THEY SAY ALL YOU DO IS
DO A TRUMP ONE.
THEN IF YOU DO ANYTHING THAT IS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, THEY
SAY, OH, MY GOSH, YOU ARE DOING
THAT.
I THINK THE CONFLICT IS
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESS TRIES
TO DO.
AS GOVERNOR, THE GOOD THING THAT
I WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER FOR
FLORIDA IS, I HAVE A POSITIVE
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT
AND KEY PEOPLE IN THE
ADMINISTRATION.
FLORIDA HAS A LOT OF NEEDS FROM
OUR MILITARY FOOTPRINT,
TRANSPORTATION AND WATER
RESOURCES WHICH HAS BEEN A BIG
PROBLEM HERE AND WE NEED TO WORK
CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
ANDREW GILLUM HAS BEEN RUNNING
ON DONALD TRUMP, AND I DON'T
THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING PRODUCTIVELY WITH THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL
BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
I THINK THAT'S A CLEAR
DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE
VOTERS OF FLORIDA WOULD GET OUT
OF A GOVERNOR.
I WILL BE ABLE TO ADVANCE
FLORIDA'S PRIORITIES AND I DON'T
THINK YOU WELL.
>> Martha: WE WOULD LOVE TO
COME DOWN AND SEE THE DEBATE,
