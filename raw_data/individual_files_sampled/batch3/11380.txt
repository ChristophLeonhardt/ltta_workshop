I'm option retention we're going underground 53 years to the day of the assassination of anti imperialist human rights activist Malcolm X coming up in the show as us actors rosario Dawson and Sarah Silverman join Jeremy Corbyn Alice Walker and Angela Davis in calling for Israel to release Palestinian teenager ahead Tamimi we speak to Professor Norman Finkelstein about the collusion of human rights organizations as warplanes from Israel armed by Britain a game bomb Gaza and from the headlines the Bank that likes to leave its clients hanging and ice by Corbin in Westminster the did he spy for a country in the eastern bloc we check it out all this and more coming up in today's going underground but first not even elite mainstream media paid much attention to Israel's prime minister in the past few days he brandished a bit of alleged Iranian drone at the Munich Security Conference attended by UK minority government leader tourism a and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov so given we have yet to interview anyone from the Israeli government or Israeli embassy in London on this show he has been Ewan Netanyahu you can see for yourself some commentators expressed doubt about politicians bringing props for their speeches Iraq declared 8,500 leaders of anthrax Ben aside from : Powell's UN Security Council justifications for mass killing in Iraq it was iran's Foreign Minister speaking in Munich who was keen for the world to note that Netanyahu's protestations about Iran come at a tricky time for him Israeli police are recommending that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on to corruption cases and recommendations follow a months-long investigation into allegations of bribery well in the latest book by our next guest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who denies all allegations comes under fire for more than just bribery joining me now omits yet more bombing of Palestine by the british armed Israeli government is Professor Norman Finkelstein his latest book is called Gaza an inquest into its martyrdom thanks so much Norman coming back on the show Israel back militarily by the UK is again bombing Gaza Assad timeliness for the book when I wrote the book I didn't expect that it would be timely I wrote it as a historic document because Palestine and and Gaza in particular were falling off the news much to my surprise because the situation in Gaza has reached the breaking point since 2012 the UN reports have been saying they typically write will Gaza be livable in 2020 then the next report says I think it's going to be sooner than 2020 and now in the past month not just UN reports but Israel has been saying Gaza is on the brink of collapse we're reaching the point of no return and so there's a lot of desperation Israelis fear that if diseases breakout in Gaza they're going to spread to Israel and so we're at a turning point a crisis point not sure what you would want to call it but the essential factors I see it is this 70% of the people of Gaza are refugees more than half are children they're trapped there's no way out and the UN reports and even Israel is saying the situation there is unlivable now you use your own semantical imagination how would you describe a situation where people are caged into conditions which are literally unlivable what word would you use I'm not going to use the word use your own imagination and as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency UNRWA put it it said Gaza is unique in the world in this one regard wherever there's a natural catastrophe say there's drought or a human-made catastrophe say war in Syria the people always have the option to flee there's always the option to flee Gaza is the one case the one instance in the world today where they are verging on an unlivable situation that's not poetry that's a physical biological fact unlivable 95% of the water in Gaza is unfit for human consumption each day when a child drinks water the child is poisoning him or herself but they can't leave they're caged in as your former prime minister put it Gaza is an open-air prison let's just skip through because I know you go through the die here doctrine which is to do it Lebanon and then explain who Goldstone judge Goldstone is and how initially he caused sadness then an uplifting feeling amongst those who support the Palestinians and then ultimately it was an important moment and I hope you'll allow me give you the time to explain under international law war crimes consist of three things disproportionate attacks indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilians those are equivalent under international law that is to say there's no hierarchy disproportionate force indiscriminate force and targeting of civilians are all considered equal war crimes along came Goldstone Goldstone had three so to speak immunities immunity number one is a very respected international jurist immunity number two is not only Jewish but he's not Jewish just by fortune he's proudly Jewish he's very self identified as a Jew number three he's self-identified as a Zionist he doesn't run away from that label that's who I am he sits in the board of directors of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem his daughter did what's called Aliyah namely she went she went to Israel for nationalistic reasons he is a bonafide Zionist Jewish respected jurist he produces a report and he causes a red line he causes a red line he said the attacks were not enough essentially disproportionate they're not essentially indiscriminate he said the purpose of Operation Cast Lead was to punish humiliate and terrorize a civilian population in other words Israel Israel's objective was not military it was not targeting combatants it was not targeting military sites its objective was the civilian population that was a horse of a totally different color I know but just very briefly and then and then suddenly he recanted well he came under huge attack personal attack professional attack dredging up his past when he was a judge in South Africa under the apartheid regime going for the moral jugular telling him he can't attend his grandsons Bar Mitzvah in South Africa he's a South Africa he was a South African citizen and still is comes under tremendous attack and then on April 1st 2011 which is April Fool's Day in the United States we all thought it was a prank open up the newspaper Washington Post he recanted the whole report because he said that he had underestimated the number of Hamas military casualties because previously everyone had said how is it that Hamas had been untouched by the British backed warplane airstrikes well killing so God's done claimed that he recanted because of what he called new information that since he had published the report was published he came to new conclusions based on your information I went through all the new and so-called new information there was no new information it's very clear there was no new information I can even say and I il admit I can't prove it but I talked to a very respected jurist and those Goldstone very well very well he said there's no way he wrote that recantation in the Washington Post he knows his style it was it was very murky we'll try and get comment from me but there's a part of the book then goes on to write now let me get to the point after he recanted everybody got scared because in my opinion I can't prove it again he recanted not because of the public pressure but because he was blackmailed the public pressure I go through the details it doesn't make sense I think he was blackmail of course he found dirt on him everybody even the most why I am to see international level well because after the Goldstone everybody got scared what is uh what is your god on us because everybody's got a skeleton in their closet and even the most impeccable person has a relative who has a skeleton in their closet personal threats no blame no threats or fear of personal threats and so what happens after Operation Cast Lead in 2008-9 there were about 300 human rights reports everybody was weighing in after Operation protective edge in July August 2014 which was many times worse than Operation Cast Lead 6,000 homes were destroyed during castle ed 18,000 during Operation protective product of edge 350 children killed during cast led 550 children during protective edge there were you know you could count on the fingers of two hands the number of Human Rights supports Human Rights Watch put out five substantial reports after Operation Cast Lead after Operation protective edge one skimpy forget about having you do say it in in the book but Amnesty International and so Amnesty was the only one that actually weighed in after Operation protective edge five reports complete total disaster I want to just say because Amnesty may be listening and I want to say I don't the book is not written with malice against amnesty I was so crushed I was so devastated because I had depended on amnesty if you look at the first four chapters in operation castle a lot of its based on amnesty they put out a very good report of the local 22 days of the straw abrasion Kessler 22 their ease of death and destruction stuff on protective edge you wanted to see like suffocating what are you doing here I'll give you one example they put out a report it's called families under the rubble and it describes Israel's targeting of homes during Operation protective edge and it says well Israel destroyed all these homes many civilians were killed and they said the attacks were disproportionate the attacks were indiscriminate but then they say we think there was a Hamas militant in this house and we think there was a Hamas militant in that house and we think there was a Hamas militant as if as if this was a legitimate military attack that had become excessive but then you read the breaking the silence the Israeli soldiers who were in Gaza and they described what happened and what you see happened was is you're I'm using their words they go into a neighborhood they rope off the neighborhood they bring in to d9 bulldozers and now this is the words they use they bring in the bulldozer they say the bulldozer goes back and forth back and forth demolish is one house the now demolish is another house then it says demolish is a neighborhood back and forth 24/7 back and forth they sigil is as if they were in a sandbox and then along comes amnesty and pretends as if there were legitimate military targets there okay present Norman Finkelstein I'll just stop you there we're gonna go to a break more from professor Norman Finkelstein in part 2 of going on the ground welcome back we're still here with Professor Norman Finkelstein can I just take us back to the eighties the first intifada know that arguably we're now approaching the the third you quote you quote saying yeah this is when britain labour and Tory governments were funding them they were trying shooting to kill shooting to injure beatings mass arrests torture trials detentions sanctions of course and yet they still keep on fighting a child is now in the news I had to me me what hopes do you think she'll getting a fair trial in the only democracy in the Middle East there's no hope of her getting a fair trial if you look at the record in fact the death Selim the Israeli human rights organization for the occupied territories it has stopped Kawada record in coordinating and cooperating with the Israeli military trials because it said they're just forces so we're not going to even bother anymore to go through the motions because all it does is provide a smokescreen for Israel that there's a legal process going on when there is him so we can leave aside that it's a done deal she's not getting a fair trial but we have to look out the potential there was a potential there the Palestinians have basically tried three strategies they have tried armed resistance that's Gaza the fact of the matter is speaking honestly they went they went into combat with Israel three times Castle a protective edge and what was called pillar of defense in November 2012 each time the goal was the same to end the siege it didn't work it didn't work they won at the end that brutal and legal and moral siege it didn't work the armed resistance has not produced a result the objective that they saw it we all can agree it's now kind of not a discussion anymore diplomacy doesn't work it's a waste of time they go to fancy hotels they just talking doesn't change anything enjoy America it seems to make that point but he'll still go to the deploy still go to the meetings because he likes the five star hotels there hey that's not the reason well but that is the reason unless he's a complete imbecile which is a serious possibility and he doesn't even realize that nothing has happened I'm sure he was a full of a positive right and then there's the third possibility which is mass nonviolent resistance and I do believe that it has potential in our graph to your book yeah and some people may wonder because obviously there was a 1/1 movement that hit Israel and won against Israel is obviously Hezbollah how what is there's no violence that you're talking about how does it fit in with Gandhi and with with military well let's be clear I am very emphatic in the book the Palestinians have the right to armed resistance they have the right to fire their so-called rockets at Israel I do not waiver I am NOT equivocal on that point as I say I say they have the legal right look at what the law says I go through the law very carefully they have the right to resist with armed force the Israeli occupation and the Israeli denial of their right to self-determination but there's a big chasm that separates what you legally have the right to do and what's politically prudent that is to say what works and I say in the book that although they have the legal right and I will not for a moment retreat encourages from that point I say politically it has not produced the results that were your announced objective namely to end the siege on the other hand I do believe that mass nonviolent resistance has the possibility let's take a simple example the image that illuminated the Palestinian oppression during the First Intifada was the little children with the stones the children of the stones as it was called an international public opinion accepted the right of children to throw stones in the face of this Israeli killing machine they had the right to throw stones against the Israeli occupiers now imagine use your imagination for a moment the Israelis were enraged they were furious they were driven mad by this little girl I had a Mimi who smacks an Israeli soldier how dare you smack an uber mentioned how dare the alter mentioned the subhuman smack an uber mentioned and it's rarely soldier and there were all these serious debates on Israeli TV whether the soldier was showing honor or the shot whether the soldier was showing cowardice by not reacting to the girl imagine if the Palestinians adopted the strategy every woman should smack a soldier smack a soldier today just like we have the me2 movement let them have a meet oh I smacked the soldier today the Israelis would go mad they would command and it has an opportunity a possibility now that's according to Gandhi by the way one of the things he says is if a woman is being raped and the woman to resist the rapist she smacks him she scratches him she pummels him Gandhi says in my view that's not violence that's a person trying to summon the moral courage to die with dignity he says I won't call that violence he said when you have such a vast disproportion in power between the oppressor and the oppressed when the oppressed engages in some kinds of what you might call symbolic resistance armed he said in my book that's not violence so he said in 1939 the German ver mocked the army the Luftwaffe it invades Poland Poland comes out with a few tanks a few artillery pieces to resist the German army and air force Gandhi said that's not violence that analogy is exactly with the Palestinians a few token rockets or a young woman smacking a soldier who's been occupying humiliating degrading destroying the lives of people for 50 years five decades and she doesn't have the right to smack this person who invades her home kills her cousin no you have that right even not leave aside the international law even the apostle of non-violence Mahatma Gandhi said you have that right I have no doubt none whatsoever that if he were alive today and he was as you might know a strong proponent of what he called dr. an Arab rights in Palestine was near Palestinian rights Arab rights in Palestine and he was very emphatic in 1936 as you know there was the Arab uprising against the British occupation of Palestine and Gandhi was asked about it and he said look I wish they would adopt the tactic of non-violence I wish but he said according to the canons ca n ons according to the canons of right and wrong they have the right to use armed force in other words according to current legality and morality are people under occupation have the right he says I wish they would choose my strategy but they aren't under a legal obligation to not resist the people of Gaza they are under a legal obligation to just lay down and die a blockade a blockade which is at the point of making the place on livable unlivable the whole international community knows it Israel itself says it and they're supposed to lay down and die they don't have the right to resist no that makes no sense to me so I'm not gonna fold them I'm going to say I don't think it's a wise or prudent strategy I think if you took the 1 million children of Gaza you put them at the head of a mass demonstration and you're marched into those checkpoints which are suffocating them which are strangling them strangulating them which are throttling them you march in those checkpoints and you say we're going through we're going through I think Israel will have a very hard time will they kill children yes I'm not doubting it but the point is during Operation protective edge that killed 550 children people of Gaza got nothing for it the blockade is still there the siege is still there I think if you bring bring a million children and you raise a legitimate demand and the siege and the blockade this place is unlivable the water is poisoned Israel will kill maybe ten kids maybe it'll kill twenty kids but way way way before you reach 550 if they manage to stay nonviolent the people of Gaza Israel will be forced by international pressure to break the siege professor Norman Finkelstein thank you joining me now to go through some of the week's headlines is broadcaster and former Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament limba Dobek he brought the headlines I have their son for you there's a quick switcheroo UK Prime Minister meets the Dutch p.m. today yes he lost his Foreign Minister over Putin so what are these connections that we got between Jeremy Corbyn and something Russian and Soviet in Eastern and evil and evil you know that because it's in the mail online Teresa made amongst Jeremy Corbyn authorized the release of his Stasi file after he was named in a foreign spy dossier as a contact for a Czech agent you can't get a much longer headline checkmate obviously in the Stasi headquarters in 1989 that broke through and told they want to keep the files safe so that we could find out things like this I'm safe maybe you were trying to conceal the dirty secrets of Jeremy calls your take on this story it's rubbish it's complete rubbish Jeremy Corbyn has never been afraid of his sympathy towards the left he was always a peacenik in his past days before being who do you mean meeting diplomats and insert oh come legally the Boris Johnson's Droid which we don't have here who's he be meeting oh yeah this is the other point Boris Johnson's friend friend has been exposed as a spy too but that doesn't count because he's concerned enough in the Russian it doesn't count just go Corbin because he loves the Russians well maybe Boris Johnson can go to defend her fatherland day on Friday to Moscow and commemorate all the millions of fought against the Nazis unlike was present as a celebration at the Baptist okay anyway let's go to a bank seventy-three percent owned by the UK taxpayer yes indeed going well The Herald reports RBS never challenged infamous let customer hang memo says conduct report lots of secret ish documents have come out suggesting a certain lack of respect for customers including one suggesting that customers should be allowed to hang and another one saying that the many of them were tiresome but women enumerative slightly embarrassing consoie wasn't they had in the financial conduct authority not releasing this until the Treasury Committee in Parliament order them - what exactly is going on with regulation of the city here why don't you ask them because a lot of people are asking that same question this seems to be in the public interest because it suggests a certain attitude towards the customers who are bearing the brunt of the collapse of the British and frankly Western banking industry they haven't really come forward yet there will be apologies there will be red faces but it does give an insight into how grateful the banks were for us bailing them out maybe if we took the 27% back as well the bank wouldn't be letting customers hang and I presume that wasn't literal well let's now go to a tweet from a very senior figure in the Turkish government yes this is a complicated story ashen Abraham Killeen has tweeted he's a government spokesman in - in Turkey translating this being translated and it says the news reports of PYD YPG I'll explain that in a minute agreement with the regime on Afrin are apparently for propaganda purposes however it does not mean there are not some secret and dirty bargains going on whatever happens as a ten-dollar military action will continue taking place and it will reach its goal complicated tweets the Turks Turkish military that's right what's really underlying this is a web of intrigue which suggests that America has been fighting terror with terror there's another group called the PKK which is regarded as a terrorist organization but American money American arms 5,000 truckloads of weapons of some have been poured into this mess presumably to fight Assad but actually that really hasn't made much of an impact except to give the terrorists arms that's why it's so complex it's not that complex Russia Syria the United States working with the PKK allies in Afrin against Britain and Turkey no that's completely not the case of NATO Civil War well it's it's NATO Civil War but it's not that Civil War within a civil war because it's not at all clear why America is essentially backing both sides Turkey's claiming that they're the ones who are sorting out the problem to some extent it looks like they're right but I'm telling you it seems pretty biased well I think you should be on the side of Washington and Moscow finally United I can't believe you've just said that albeit against London but anyway and their innovation itself at the same time thank you that's it for the show we'll be back on Saturday when we ask the co-author of Britain's 2015 modern slavery act the Bishop of Derby Alistair Redfern if the idea of modern slavery itself in a society now driven to use food banks divides and rules the poorer till then keep a contact via social media we'll see on Saturday 15 years to the day of the death of Marxist historian of the English revolution Christopher Hill author of the world turned upside down
