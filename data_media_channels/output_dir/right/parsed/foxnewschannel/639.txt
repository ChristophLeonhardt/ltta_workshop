NEWS OF THE DAY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT RUSSIA.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE
ASSESSMENT, OUR
PRESIDENT APPEARED WEAK STANDING
NEXT TO PRESIDENT PUTIN IN
SOMETHING" ON OUR PRESIDENT FOR
HIM TO BE ACTING THIS WAY?
>> Secretary Pompeo: SHANNON,
I THINK THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE
ABSURD.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
RELENTLESS IN ITS EFFORT STARTED
HER RUSH FROM ITS BAD BEHAVIOR.
WE INHERITED A SITUATION WHERE
THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN
FRANKLY, MORE HEAT THAN LIGHT.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
STRONG IN SUPPORTING THE
UKRAINIANS.
STRONG AND MAKING SURE THAT WE
PROTECT AGAINST RUSSIAN
EXPANSION TO OTHER PARTS OF THE
WORLD.
WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THREAT IS
REAL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN STRONG
AND PROTECTING AMERICA FROM
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION.
>> Shannon:
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS
REPORTING THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS
MEDDLING, PRESENTED COMPELLING
DO YOU WORRY THAT HE CONTINUES
TO EQUIVOCATE ON THIS ISSUE OF
WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN
RUSSIAN MEDDLING?
>> Secretary Pompeo: I DID
HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO THE
PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS OVER THE
THE PRESIDENT CONSISTENTLY BEEN
BRIEFED ON THIS ISSUE, HE KNOWS
THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE
INTERFERED IN OUR ELECTIONS, HE
FRANKLY UNDERSTANDS THAT HAS
BEEN GOING ON FOR AN AWFULLY
LONG TIME.
SOMEHOW AMERICA SEEMS TO FORGET
THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA'S EFFORTS
TO UNDERMINE WESTERN DEMOCRACY
FOR DECADES NOW.
PARTISAN CASE OF IT WITH RESPECT
TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.
THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS WHAT
RUSSIA DID IN OUR ELECTIONS OF
2016.
HE HAS EMPOWERED EACH OF US TO
MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
AGAIN IN THE 2018 OR 2020
ELECTIONS HERE IN THE
UNITED STATES AS WELL.
>> Shannon: LOOKING AT THOSE
THINGS MOVING FORWARD, THE
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED YESTERDAY BY
THE PRESS CORPS WHETHER HE
BELIEVES MEDDLING IS STILL
ONGOING.
HE RESPONDED, "THANK YOU, NO."
THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HE WAS
SAYING NO TO FURTHER QUESTIONS.
DO YOU BELIEVE RUSSIA STILL
MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTIONS?
WILL TRY TO UNDERMINE WESTERN
DEMOCRACY IN 2017, 2018, 2019,
AND FOR AN AWFULLY LONG TIME.
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS
LEADERS OF UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT TO DO ALL WE CAN TO
DETER THEM FROM INTERFERING WITH
US, NOT ONLY IN OUR ELECTIONS,
BUT MORE BROADLY AS WELL.
>> Shannon: THE RUSSIAN
ADVISOR TO THE U.S. IS NOW
MADE IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT.
CAN YOU TELL ANYTHING ABOUT IT?
>> Secretary Pompeo: I'M NOT
SURE I WILL TAKE THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR'S WORD FOR A WHOLE
LOT.
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW, I HAVE HAD A
CHANCE TO TALK TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT HIS
DISCUSSIONS WITH
HANDFUL OF FRONTS, AGREEMENT TO
TRY TO WORK MORE CLOSELY ON
COUNTERTERRORISM.
AN EFFORT TO BEGIN CONVERSATIONS
AROUND ARMS CONTROL, TO PREVENT
THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR
PROLIFERATION.
THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS
DISCUSSED FACT REMAINS A GREAT
DEAL OF WORK TO DO.
THE PRESIDENT ACCOMPLISHED A
GREAT DEAL OF GOALS, WHICH WAS
TO CREATE A WAY WHICH TWO
LEADERS OF THESE IMPORTANT
COUNTRIES GET HALF POSITIVE,
CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT
SURROUND IS INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT ISSUES.
THEY WILL BE LOTS OF PLACES ARE
RHETORICAL COUNTRIES INTERESTS
AND VALUES DIVERGE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DEEPLY AWARE
OF THAT.
>> Shannon: ANY CHANCES
ADMINISTRATION WOULD ENTERTAIN
THE IDEA OF ALLOWING PUTIN OR
ANYONE FROM HIS TEAM TO HAVE THE
ABILITY TO QUESTION OR HAVE
PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF PEOPLE LIKE
OUR FORMER AMBASSADOR, McFAUL,
OR OTHER DHS OFFICIALS WHO HAVE
BEEN INVESTIGATING THINGS THAT
>> Secretary Pompeo: NONE.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK
NORTH KOREA.
TOMORROW YOU HAD TO BE RUN --
>> Secretary Pompeo: I HAVE TO
ANSWER THAT QUESTION QUICKLY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY
RESOLUTE.
HE UNDERSTANDS PRECISELY WHO IT
IS WE ARE DEALING WITHIN RUSSIA
HE IS TRYING TO TAKE
OPPORTUNITIES, PLACES WHERE WE
CAN WORK TOGETHER AND PUT
AMERICA IN A POSITION TO DO THE
THINGS HE WANTS TO DO ON BEHALF
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> Shannon: NORTH KOREA.
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE REPORTS
AND ASSESSMENTS THAT NORTH KOREA
HAS NO INTENTION AT ALL OF
GETTING RID OF THEIR NUCLEAR
AMBITIONS AND PROGRAM?
>> Secretary Pompeo: NO ONE
HAS BEEN CLOSER TO THAT THAN I
HAVE.
EVERYONE ELSE IS SIMPLY
PLACE TODAY.
I HAVE BEEN THERE.
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE
CONSISTENTLY REAFFIRMED THEIR
COMMITMENT, THE COMMITMENT THAT
CHAIRMAN KIM MAY DO
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN
HOURS OR DAYS OR EVEN WEEKS.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO
ACHIEVE THIS OUTCOME.
WE HOPE FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE
FOR THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.
IF CHAIRMAN KIM CONTINUES TO
FOLLOW THROUGH ON HIS
COMMITMENT, THE PEOPLE OF
NORTH KOREA WILL HAVE A BRIGHTER
FUTURE.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE HISTORIC MEETING YOU PUT
TOGETHER, THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL
MEETING ADDRESSING RELIGIOUS
PERSECUTION AROUND THE GLOBE.
WHY WAS IT IMPORTANT TO DO THAT?
>> Secretary Pompeo: RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN
RIGHTS.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OUGHT
TO BE IN THE LEAD IN PROMOTING
SHANNON, NOT EVERY COUNTRY HAS
ARE PUNISHED FOR THEIR BELIEFS,
OR FRANKLY, THE ABSENCE OF THEIR
BELIEFS.
WE OUGHT TO PROMOTE THAT AROUND
THE WORLD.
I WANT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR
STATE DEPARTMENT TO BE FRONT AND
CENTER, TALKING ABOUT RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM.
NOT EVERY COUNTRY WILL DITCH THE
PLACE WE WANT BUT I'M CONFIDENT
THAT IF WE FOCUS ON THIS AS
PART OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY, WE
CAN MAKE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR
INDIVIDUALS ALL ACROSS THE WORLD
AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
>> Shannon: WE HAVE A CASE OF
THE AMERICAN PASTOR, ANDREW
BRUNSON, BEING HELD IN TURKEY.
YESTERDAY, DENIED FREEDOM, AS
WITH MANY ARE CALLING A SHAM
TRIAL, CONTINUING.
SITUATION?
>> Secretary Pompeo: THERE'S
BEEN AN ENORMOUS WORK DONE BY
THIS ADMINISTRATION TO GAIN THE
RELEASE OF PASTOR BRUNSON.
WORK FOR THE UNITED STATES, HELD
IN TURKEY TODAY.
WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY ON
THAT CASE AND FRANKLY, EVERY
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM MATTERS.
WE WILL HAVE OVER 80 DELEGATIONS
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND
HANDFUL OF DAYS, 40 OF MY
COUNTERPARTS, FOREIGN MINISTERS,
HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY, THE
VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE SPEAKING
AT THE EVENT.
WE BELIEVE WE CAN INCREASE THE
CAPACITY FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AND
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM BY GATHERING
THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD AND
WORKING TOGETHER TO GET OUTCOMES
SO WE CAN PREVENT SITUATIONS
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK THAT
THEY ARE -- HUMANS ARE INTO OUR
COUNTRY IS UNIQUE WHEN IT COMES
TO THE ISSUE OF RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM.
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
CUT ACROSS THOSE BIASES AND
OTHER THEOCRATIC AREAS AROUND
THE WORLD WHERE THIS IS A REAL
ISSUE?
LIFE AND DEATH FOR MANY PEOPLE.
>> Secretary Pompeo: IT IS
INDEED LIFE-AND-DEATH WAY THAT
IS WHY THIS MINISTERIAL
GATHERING IS SO IMPORTANT.
EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES TO
BECOME AS RELIGIOUSLY TOLERANT
AS THE UNITED STATES IS.
BUT WE HAVE SEEN THIS, EVERY
TIME WE TAKE AN ACTION TO
PROTECT FROM ANTI-SEMITISM OR
OF RELIGIOUS FAITHS, EVERY TIME
WE ACT IN THAT WAY, GATHER THE
NATIONS OF THE WORLD TO TALK
ABOUT WHY THAT MATTERS TO MAKE
THEIR COUNTRY BETTER, WE THINK
IT IS REAL PROGRESS AND WE
THINK, EVERY LITTLE INCREASE IN
