00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
hi friends so yesterday Nicole made a

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,259
video about how certain sense for her

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,660
are tied to specific memory the incense

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that her office neighbor burns reminds</font>

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,679
her of mosquito coils from when she was

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">studying abroad I love your point about</font>

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,580
how she might never think of or remember

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,130
mosquito coils normally but the smell of

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,740
something not quite that but almost that

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,050
brought it right back for her it got<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,250
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the sense that trigger</font>

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,560
memories for me for example whenever I

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,330
walked by a laundromat especially when

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,519
it has like vents that blow<font color="#E5E5E5"> up from the</font>

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,040
dryers it instantly pings me back to

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,140
when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> dating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my husband and I</font>

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,930
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 and sitting in his 98th toyota</font>

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,239
corolla on the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my friends soccer</font>

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,040
game<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hard time with</font>

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,140
summer because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just reminds me of</font>

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,390
being really isolated when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was a kid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,370
spent almost entire summer it's not

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,840
really hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with anybody or</font>

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing anybody and just being more or</font>

25
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,100
less by myself for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better part of</font>

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,660
three months and so the smell of

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,579
humidity for me and I do believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font>

28
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,829
a smell<font color="#CCCCCC"> its damp obviously I'm kind of</font>

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,100
woody makes me feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lonely old</font>

30
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,319
dirty dish sponges and the smell of

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,170
water<font color="#CCCCCC"> after you've cooked pasta in it</font>

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,200
both remind me of pulling the mattress

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,479
onto the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and watching planet earth</font>

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,210
dvds in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my very first apartment it</font>

35
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,100
wasn't as you could probably gather a

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,890
particularly pleasant smelling place but

37
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,659
it was also one of the happiest years of

38
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,909
my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do wonder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of scent</font>

39
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,130
will ping back this part of my life<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

40
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,869
me in the future maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be the</font>

41
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,840
smell of curry powder and<font color="#CCCCCC"> paprika maybe</font>

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,180
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like wet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plastered peeling off</font>

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,490
the walls maybe it's peppermint oil from

44
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that my apartment was overrun</font>

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,090
with spiders and I learned that

46
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,369
peppermint oil repels them it's probably

47
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,500
unknowable until it strikes me however

48
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,630
many years down the road so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

49
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,579
know what sense trigger memories for you

50
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,920
and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you nicole for the prompt i</font>

51
