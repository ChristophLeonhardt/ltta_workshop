MANAGER COREY LEWANDOWSKI SAID
HE NEVER HEARD THAT WORD AND
THERE WAS NEVER A CONVERSATION
>> Ed: TRACE GALLAGHER
THE FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR THE
2017 TRUMP CAMPAIGN, CURRENT
SENIOR ADVISOR TO A 2020
CAMPAIGN, KATRINA PIERSON,
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT SO WE
DON'T HAVE YOU AT THEIR NIGHT IN
US LAST NIGHT BECAUSE I GOT AN
EMAIL THAT YOU TOLD TREVOR NOAH
AT "THE DAILY SHOW" SHE HEARD ME
TELL YOU THAT YOU KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT CONFERENCE CALL, TALKING
ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT USED
FOR N-WORD, YOU SAID THIS WAS A
MOVIE SCRIPT.
SO SHE SHE SAYS, SHE RELEASED AT
LEAST ONE OF THESE AUDIOTAPES TO
NOT TRUE AS WELL.
THERE ARE TWO OF TWO THINGS THAT
OCCURRED LAST NIGHT IN OUR
DISCUSSION.
YOU HAVE READ FOR ME A BOOK
EXCERPT THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN
BECAUSE THE BOOK CANNOT COME
OUT YET, AND YOU REFERENCED MEAN
THAT IS FALSE.
>> SHE HAS BEEN ON THIS CAMPAIGN
TRAIL -- ON HER LITTLE BOOK
TRAIL -- WHEN HER INTERVIEW WITH
CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH GUTHRIE,
CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH GUTHRIES
CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH GUTHRIEE
ADDRESSING IN ALL OF MY
INTERVIEWS.
LET'S PLAY THE CLIP FROM LAST
NIGHT.
I WAS ASKING YOU ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT TALKING TO LONGTIME
AIDE LYNNE PATTON ABOUT WHETHER
OR NOT HE HAD USED THIS BE 23.
LET'S PLAY THAT AND WE'LL GET TO
THE FACTS.
SPEAK A LONG TIME TRUMP AIDE
REPORTED SHE ASKED TRUMP ABOUT
IT ON THE PLANE SPECIFICALLY,
WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE SO TREY
TATE MIGHT EXIST, AND HE SAID
NO.
THEN SHE, KATRINA, ASKED HIM
WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO.
KATRINA CURSED AND SAID, HE SAID
IT.
DID THAT HAPPEN?
>> 
NO, ED.
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS WRITING A
SCRIPT FOR A MOVIE.
I HAVE ALREADY BEEN OUT THERE
TALKING ABOUT THIS, THAT IS
ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
I SAID "SHE" LAST NIGHT, I SAID,
"SHE," KATRINA PIERSON, WITH THE
BOOK SAYS, "YOU, WHEN PEARSON."
THAT I APOLOGIZE.
THAT IS AN HONEST MISTAKE.
THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT
THAT YOU ARE NOW CLAIMING THEY
ARE TRIGGERED EVERY PHONE CALLS,
TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WITH JASON
LINE WITH JASON MILLER, ONE WITO
LINE WITH JASON MILLER, ONE WITT
LINE WITH JASON MILLER, ONE WITA
SECOND.
THE ONE WITHOUT JASON MILLER ON
CBS, OMAROSA SAYS COME ACCORDING
TO A TRANSCRIPT YOU PROVIDED MAY
COME A POINT THEY ARE NOT
AIRED YET, OMAROSA SAYS, "YEAH,
IT'S OUT THERE," MEANING THIS
WEEK 23 TAPE, IT IS JUST -- AND
KATRINA PIERSON CUTS IN, "YEAH,
HE SAID IT.
, OKAY."
THAT IS A ROUGHLY WHAT SHE SAID
IN THE BOOK, THAT YOU CURSED HIM
AS I ASK YOU LAST NIGHT, AND YOU
SAID, HE SAID IT.
HE USED FOR N-WORD.
YOU DENY THAT TO ME.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW WHY?
I'M REFUTING A CLAIM THAT
OMAROSA MADE AND I'LL SAY IT
AGAIN ON CHUCK TODD AND SAVANNAH
GUTHRIE.
>> Ed: LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT
CHUCK TODD.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STATE.
PARDON ME.
I'M NOT GOING TO -- PARDON ME!
NO, NO, NO -- THE TAPE SAYS THAT
YOU SAID THAT HE SAID IT.
YOU TOLD ME YOU NEVER SAID THAT!
SPEAK ABOUT IS NOT.
>> THIS IS THE QUESTION -- THIS
IS REGARDS TO A SPECIFIC
DISCUSSION -- CHECK THE TAPE OF
WHAT HE SAID ON CHUCK TODD AND
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE!
SHE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT I
SAID AND CONFIRMED THAT
THAT IS WHAT I'M REFUTING!
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY, ED, WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY, OMAROSA
SUBMITTED TWO DIFFERENT TAPES TO
CBS --
>> WE HAVE TO!
>> Ed: NO, NO, PARDON ME.
IT'S OUR SHOW.
HANG ON ONE SECOND.
I WILL ADMIT THEIR STRUGGLE
TAPES.
LEAVE LEAD THIS DISCUSSION.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
TODAY, YOU CLARIFIED TODAY AND
SAID, I JUST SAID, YES, HE USED
THE N-WORD BECAUSE THEY WANTED
TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION ALONG.
>> THAT WAS A DIFFERENT
DISCUSSION.
TO BE WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE
IF THAT IS THE TRUTH, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME, ED, I DON'T KNOW
YES, HE USED THE N-WORD TO MOVE
THE CONVERSATION ALONG.
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT LAST NIGHT.
>> THE QUESTION I WAS ASKED
ABOUT THIS CONFERENCE CALL WITH
JASON MILLER, THE ANSWER IS, NO.
THAT WAS NOT SAID BY THE
THE FIRST CALL THAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT WHERE SHE IS
CLAIMING THAT I SAID THAT WAS IN
PATTON ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF
THIS TAPE.
LET ME EXPLAIN SOME THING TO!
OMAROSA HAS BEEN USING THIS TAPE
DOG WITH A BONE IN THIS TAPE --
>> Ed: YOU KEEP USING "DOG" --
LET'S GO TO THE FACTS ARE NOT
ATTACKS.
>> ABSOLUTELY PRIDES ME WHEN YOU
KEEP TALKING ABOUT A SIMILAR.
THE SECOND CALL.
>> Ed: LET TALK ABOUT THAT
ON THAT CALL, YOU SEE IN YOUR
STATEMENT TODAY THAT BASICALLY,
WE WERE JUST SIFTING THROUGH
HE WAS A CAMPAIGN AIDE.
IN FACT, WE HAVE A TRANSCRIPT
THAT YOU PROVIDED, OKAY, AND
HERE IS WHAT IS ON THE TAPE.
JASON MILLER SAYS, "IT'S KIND OF
TOUGH TO GO OUT AND DROP
SOMETHING ABOUT WHETHER THE
PRESIDENT USES THE N-WORD WHEN
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CONTEXT
IS.
I HATE TO START EMAILING THINGS
AROUND WHEN WE ARE JUST -- THAT
IS SIFTING THROUGH RUMORS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO AROUND
MAKING THESE ACCUSATIONS AND
COMING UP WITH THINGS --
IT'S VERY TRUE.
>> Ed: YOU SAY -- HANG ON.
YOU JUST MISQUOTED YOURSELF.
YOU SAID, I SAID, THAT IS TRUE.
NO, YOU SAID IT'S TRUE.
>> THE AUDIO SAID, IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE, YOU DON'T WANT TO
MAKE THOSE KINDS OF CLAIMS.
IF YOU BACK UP, LYNNE PATTON
SAYS, THAT'S TRUE, BECAUSE WE
ARE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT,
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE.
WE ARE SAYING, IN THIS
TRANSCRIPT, THAT THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE CAN FIND,
THEY ARE JUST RUMORS AND
INNUENDO ABOUT THIS TAPE AND IT
IS TRUE THAT WE CANNOT MOVE
FORWARD WITH THIS WITHOUT IT
RATES ME WHEN YOU JUST USE THE
TERM "DOG."
I WAS TALKING TO YOU BEFORE THE
SHOW, YOU HAVE A SON, YOU LOVE
HIM VERY MUCH.
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT OUT OF
THIS.
DO YOU RAISE YOUR SON TO CALL A
>> THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY SON.
>> Ed: WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
FOR YOU, OR FOR ME -- WE WILL
>> THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE WITH
DONALD TRUMP IN OMAROSA.
>> Ed: WE'LL LEAVE YOUR SON
OUT OF IT AND THE PRESIDENT OUT
OF IT.
WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME
TO CALL THE WOMAN A DOG?
YES OR NO?
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SHE DID TO
YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DID.
OMAROSA BIT THE HAND THAT FED
HER.
TO ME, THAT IS WHAT A DOG IS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS REFERENCE TO
SEVERAL MEN AS DOGS, LIKE
MITT ROMNEY, HE HAS OTHERS TO A
>> Ed: AS A WOMAN, DO YOU
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR ANY
MAN TO CALL THE WOMAN A DOG?
REALLY?
>> AS A WOMAN, AS A STRONG BLACK
