okay let's get to the main story the Democrats have their first scalp former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been indicted on completely unrelated charges they also got manna for its right-hand man Rick Gates and they've apparently also reached a plea deal with former campaign adviser George papadopolis not to be confused with George sucka Leppa guess who is the former Clinton War Room Clinton spokesman who pretends to be a journalist on television this is George papadopolis nobody it seems has yet pointed out that the indictment almost certainly inculpates top Democrats including Hillary's campaign chairman John Podesta's brother Tony for context Hillary Clinton was spotted hobnobbing with Tony Podesta just this weekend just like two days ago right now in so much as this indictment suggests that the Republicans colluded with Russia whatever that means we know that the Democrats colluded with Russia at least as much and really from all the evidence available to us the Democrats committed far graver misdeeds in colluding with Russia because we now know that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid a foreigner connected with Russia for alleged dirt on Donald Trump to skew an American election you know like the thing that they've been accusing us of for the last year incessantly yeah they did we have evidence that they did all that she then lied not only about the 12 million dollar price tag for that document but she also absurdly denied any knowledge of it whatsoever the president's reaction was typically trumpian he said sorry but this is years ago before a Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign but why aren't crooked Hillary and the Dems the focus with 5x5 question marks he goes on also there is no collusion in all caps employing exclamation point now it is worth noting it appears the president Trump has deleted every tweet about mana for from his timeline so the White House is not happy about this to say the least former Trump campaign advisor George papadopolis is cooperating with the special counsel and he apparently tried to set up a meeting with Russian officials for the purpose of warmer American relations with Russia you know to have a Russian reset or something in order to and these are his words increases importance as a policy adviser to the can Payne so we know that some campaign aid was offered dirt on Hillary he apparently tried to get his hands on so what that doesn't who we know the Democrats did this we know they paid millions of dollars for this and I won't even knock them for it I will not knock Hillary Clinton for her Oppo research per se I will knock her for the ridiculous hypocrisy of accusing your opponents of doing the very things that you do but every campaign does this every campaign tries to get Oppo they try to get dirt on their opponents that isn't why Papadopoulos struck a plea deal the crime that he committed was lying to the FBI this is always a bad idea to not lie to the FBI you they will find you and but the focus on Papadopoulos is a distraction away from manna for and the Podesta group and why this case wasn't prosecuted for so long we're not talking about crimes that happened six months ago were talking about crimes that happened five years ago so why wasn't it prosecuted the federal government had all of this information before the election why is it being prosecuted now the text of the indictment points to our answer it reads quote as part of the scheme in February 2012 manna fort and gates solicited to Washington DC firms company a and Company B to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych the Party of Regions and the government of Ukraine for instance Gates wrote to Company A that it would be quote representing the government of Ukraine in Washington DC I know what you're thinking who exactly are these elusive companies a and B the indictment goes on quote to minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign manif Orton Gates arranged for the Center for a modern Ukraine to be the nominal client of company a and B even though in fact the center was under ultimate direction of the government of Ukraine you knew kovitch in the Party of Regions tied to Russia it goes on at the direction of mana foreign gates company a and Company B engaged in extensive lobbying who are they a company IND well we know that five days ago NBC News reported that Muller is investigating Democrat lobbyist Tony Podesta the reason that name rings a bell is he's the brother of Hillary's campaign chairman John Podesta many now this report went on and showed that mana Ford had organized a PR campaign for this front group the European Center for modern Ukraine Podesta's company was one of the firms that worked on the campaign the Podesta group also violated the foreign agents Registration Act because it only filed is a foreign agent when it was exposed that they had so they got caught and then retroactively Lee they they registered his one just this afternoon this broke about an hour ago Tony Podesta stepped down from the Podesta group amid the investigation all of the available evidence points to the indictment in Ko painting not only a major Democrat firm for undisclosed lobbying on behalf of Russian interests not only a major Clinton crony but actually the brother of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman we're talking about lobbying efforts that took place between 2012 and 2014 that's at least three years ago it's up to five years ago what took so long for the prosecution well I don't know what do we know about Barack Obama's executive agencies during that time we know they were highly politicized we know they selectively prosecuted perceived enemies like Dinesh D'Souza they targeted conservative Tea Party groups through the IRS we know they ignored major scandals like fast and furious Hillary Clinton's email scandal on and on and on is it possible that the Obama administration didn't prosecute this case for years because it would have implicated top Hillary cronies in the run-up to her presidential run the timing sure does make you wonder
