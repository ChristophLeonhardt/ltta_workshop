it's time to go you're walking out the door you're ready to go and then all of a sudden you realize you don't have your keys and you can't find them you spend the next 10 minutes looking under couch cushions look under books and papers why do you not remember where you put your keys the number one reason you don't remember where you put your keys is you were on autopilot you walked in the room you threw them down your mind was stressed was thinking about your day you were tired or you were just on autopilot not paying attention the number one problem with your memory and not remembering is focus and when you put down your keys you weren't focused so how do we combat this imagine that your keys are a bomb right or they explode wherever you put them if you walk into a room and you toss your keys on the counter and as you toss your keys in the counter it sets that part of the counter on fire it explodes that part of the counter you can't tell me that when you want to leave an hour later you're not gonna remember that if you actually saw it it only takes two seconds to imagine that but it's gonna work and it's gonna cause you to focus
