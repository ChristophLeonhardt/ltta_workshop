1
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:03,063
CHRIS?

2
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:05,766
SHANNON:  JOINING US NOW, MITCH

3
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:06,967
McCONNELL.

4
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:07,868
MR. LEADER, WELCOME.

5
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:08,869
ANY DOUBTS IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,704
WOULD GET TO THIS POINT TODAY

7
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:12,072
AND HOW DO YOU MOVE FORWARD

8
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,975
THROUGH A PROCESS A LOT OF FOLKS

9
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:19,179
SAY IS

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,213
SAY DS

11
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:19,813
SAY DAMAGED.

12
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:21,682
>> THIS HAS BEEN A NASTY PROCESS

13
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,784
INITIATED IN THE BEGINNING BY

14
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:25,652
SENATE JUDICIARY DEMOCRATS AND

15
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:27,388
CARRIED OVER INTO THE PUBLIC.

16
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:28,822
WE'VE LITERALLY BEEN UNDER

17
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:31,525
ASSAULT BY A MOB THAT'S GOING TO

18
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:33,560
OUR HOMES, BRUSHING UP AGAINST

19
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:36,397
US IN THE HALLS, REQUIRING

20
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:37,498
ENHANCED SECURITY.

21
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:39,533
LOOK, THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE MOB

22
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:40,434
DIDN'T WIN.

23
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:42,403
JUSTICE WILL BE DONE.

24
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:44,638
WE PROTECTED THE PRESUMPTION OF

25
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:45,606
INNOCENCE IN THIS COUNTRY.

26
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:47,641
IT APPLIES IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE

27
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:52,479
AND CERTAINLY IN SUPREME COURT

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,913
CONFIRMATIONS.

29
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:54,314
SHANNON:  WELL, YOU KNOW,

30
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,150
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OBVIOUSLY

31
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:57,951
MADE THE MOMENT AND MADE THE BIG

32
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:58,952
TURN A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

33
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:00,320
YESTERDAY WHEN SHE TOOK TO THE

34
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,122
FLOOR AT 3:00 P.M. AND LAID OUT

35
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:03,957
IN DETAIL FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES

36
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,692
HER CASE FOR WHY SHE WOULD VOTE

37
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,428
YES FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

38
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:11,265
BUT SHE HAS SPLIT WITH AT

39
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:11,298
BUT SHE HAS SPLIT WITH LT

40
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,199
BUT SHE HAS SPLIT WITH LISA

41
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,367
MURKOWSKI AND OTHER COLLEAGUES

42
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:15,135
ACROSS THE AISLE.

43
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:17,237
WILL THOSE RELATIONSHIPS TAKE

44
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:19,306
TIME TO HEAL FOLLOWING THIS

45
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:19,606
FIGHT?

46
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:20,140
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

47
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:21,842
AT THE TIME WE WERE IN THE

48
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,977
MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT WE PASSED AN

49
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:30,951
OPIOID BILL AND FAA BILL BY

50
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:34,188
OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN

51
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:34,555
MAJORITY.

52
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:36,223
WE COMPLETED MOST OF THE

53
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:37,357
APPROPRIATION BILLS.

54
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,959
THIS HAS BEEN A BIG FIGHT,

55
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,860
LARGELY PARTISAN.

56
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,661
THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS

57
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:44,498
WE'RE DOING ALONG BESIDE IT ON A

58
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:44,998
BIPARTISAN BASIS.

59
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,366
CHRIS:  I WAS TALKING TO

60
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,202
SOMEBODY WHO USED TO WORK FOR

61
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:51,104
YOU AND IS A GREAT ADMIRER.

62
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:53,740
HE SAID MITCH McCONNELL HAS A

63
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:56,043
NARROW EMOTIONAL BANDWIDTH, BY

64
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,644
WHICH HE MEANT YOU DON'T NEED TO

65
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,880
RUN TOO HOT OR TOO COLD WHICH IS

66
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,682
PROBABLY A GOOD THING AS SENATE

67
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:02,483
MAJORITY LEADER.

68
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,452
IN THIS FIGHT THERE TIMES

69
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:05,486
IN THIS FIGHT WHERE TIMES

70
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:05,519
IN THIS FIGHT WERRE TIMES

71
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,552
IN THIS FIGHT WEREE TIMES

72
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:05,586
IN THIS FIGHT WERE TTIMES

73
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:05,619
IN THIS FIGHT WERE THEMES

74
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:05,719
IN THIS FIGHT WERE THERES

75
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,687
IN THIS FIGHT WERE THERE TIMES

76
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:07,855
WHEN YOU BEGAN TO RUN PRETTY

77
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:08,155
HOT.

78
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:10,057
>> THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I

79
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,859
WONDERED WHETHER WE WOULD WIN.

80
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,427
I NEVER CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT

81
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:13,827
QUITTING.

82
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:15,429
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO

83
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,363
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

84
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,664
HIS REPUTATION WAS DRAGGED

85
00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:19,066
THROUGH THE MUD FOR TWO WEEKS.

86
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,101
HE NEEDED TO HAVE A VOTE.

87
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,536
WE NEEDED TO HAVE A VOTE.

88
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:23,437
THE PRESIDENT AND I HAD TALKED

89
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:25,706
ABOUT IF WE CAME UP SHORT WE

90
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:27,708
WERE GOING TO DEAL WITH ANOTHER

91
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,343
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THIS YEAR.

92
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:30,644
AND SO WE WERE NOT GOING TO

93
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:34,281
ALLOW THIS TO GO ON FOR A

94
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:35,249
MULTITUDE OF REASONS.

95
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,384
IT WAS NOT GETTING BETTER.

96
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:41,088
THERE WAS UNCORROBORATED,

97
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:43,524
OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THROWN AT YOU,

98
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,325
TRYING TO GET THEM ON THE AIR.

99
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:46,360
THIS WASN'T GOING TO GET BETTER

100
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:47,895
WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME.

101
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:50,664
WE NEEDED TIME IF PER CHANCE WE

102
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:51,465
CAME UP SHORT.

103
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,001
THE HEROES OF THE STORY ARE

104
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:56,103
SUSAN COLLINS AND JEFF FLAKE.

105
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:58,972
THEY WANTED THIS ADDITIONAL ONE

106
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,707
WEEK INVESTIGATION.

107
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,609
THEY REALIZED IT COULDN'T BE A

108
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,510
FISHING EXPEDITION.

109
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:04,945
THEY DEFINED THE PARAMETERS OF

110
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:06,446
IT, NOT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THE

111
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:07,981
SENATORS IN DOUBT.

112
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:11,418
WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IN

113
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:11,852
ADEQUATE TIME.

114
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:13,587
THEY READ IT, REVIEWED IT AND

115
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:14,121
REACHED A DECISION.

116
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:15,322
I'M THRILLED THAT TWO OF THE

117
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,290
THREE WHO WENT THROUGH THE

118
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,624
PROCESS ARE VOTING YES AND

119
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,526
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO PUT A

120
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:22,663
NEW OUTSTANDING JUDGE ON THE

121
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:23,230
SUPREME COURT TODAY.

122
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,498
CHRIS:  YOU SAY THAT THERE WERE

123
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:26,667
MOMENTS WHEN YOU REALLY HAD

124
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:27,668
DOUBT WHETHER OR NOT THE

125
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:28,502
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION WAS GOING

126
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:30,037
TO GO THROUGH.

127
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,639
WHAT WAS YOUR MOMENT OF DEEPEST

128
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,273
DOUBT?

129
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:35,475
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY DR. FORD WAS

130
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:36,777
VERY CONVINCING.

131
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,045
I REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT AND I

132
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,446
TALKED AFTER THAT AND AGREED

133
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:43,050
THAT SHE HAD MADE AN EFFECTIVE

134
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:43,483
PRESENTATION.

135
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:44,985
I SUGGESTED AND HE AGREED THAT

136
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:46,820
THAT WAS HALF TIME, WE NEEDED TO

137
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:48,288
WAIT UNTIL THE SECOND HALF WAS

138
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,990
OVER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER

139
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:50,290
SIDE.

140
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,226
WE TALKED AGAIN AFTER JUDGE

141
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,661
KAVANAUGH'S PERFORMANCE.

142
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:57,364
WE THOUGHT IT WAS SPECTACULAR.

143
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,433
HE KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.

144
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:01,101
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US EVER

145
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:03,003
DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF

146
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:04,171
WITHDRAWAL.

147
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:05,305
BUT IF THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN

148
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:06,506
YOU MIGHT WONDER WHETHER YOU

149
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:07,908
WERE GOING TO WIN, IT CERTAINLY

150
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:12,212
WOULD HAVE BEEN AFTER DR. FORD'S

151
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:12,746
CREDIBLE TESTIMONY.

152
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:13,447
SHANNON:  YOU MENTIONED THE

153
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:14,748
INFORMATION THAT STARTED TO COME

154
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:16,450
THROUGH THE FLOOD GATES ONCE

155
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,618
THEY WERE OPENED.

156
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:20,187
MANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS  WERE

157
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:20,554
ANONYMOUS.

158
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:21,855
THEY BECAME MORE DISTURBING AS

159
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:22,823
WE WENT ALONG.

160
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:25,892
DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE ANY

161
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:26,994
ACCOUNTABILITY, SHOULD THERE BE

162
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:28,328
ANY FOR ANY OF THE CASES FOR

163
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,430
WHAT WAS ALLEGED THAT TURNED OUT

164
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:30,864
TO BE FALSE.

165
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:32,766
>> WE DON'T GET TO POLICE THE

166
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:33,400
MEDIA.

167
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,968
A LOT OF FOLKS, IN YOUR WORLD,

168
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:36,703
NOT YOU, NECESSARILY, WOULD

169
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,138
PRINT THIS STUFF OR PUT IT ON

170
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,608
THE AIR WITH NO CORROBORATION

171
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:42,009
WHATSOEVER.

172
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,210
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT, WE

173
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,244
DON'T GET TO TELL YOU WHAT TO

174
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:44,511
DO.

175
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:46,146
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SENATE

176
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,181
DEMOCRATS MAY HAVE DONE, I THINK

177
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:50,884
SENATOR GRAHAM IS ON THE

178
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:51,685
COMMITTEE, INDICATED THEY NEED

179
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:54,354
TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

180
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:55,889
SHANNON:  THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON

181
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,790
JUDGE KAVANAUGH RIGHT NOW.

182
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,325
YOU GOT SCORES OF OTHER

183
00:04:58,326 --> 00:04:58,692
NOMINEES.

184
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,127
YOU'VE HAD VERY GOOD SUCCESS IN

185
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:01,328
GETTING A NUMBER OF THE

186
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:02,863
PRESIDENT'S DOZENS AND DOZENS OF

187
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:04,531
HIS LOWER COURT NOMINEES ONTO

188
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:04,965
THE BENCH.

189
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,967
WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE STILL

190
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:09,002
WAITING, DO YOU WORRY THAT

191
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,070
WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST

192
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:12,205
COUPLE WEEKS WILL IMPACT THOSE

193
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:12,673
NOMINATIONS IN.

194
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:14,341
>> NO, WE'RE GOING TO DO THEM

195
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:14,608
ALL.

196
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:16,476
THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT

197
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,078
LONG-TERM THING IS CONFIRM THE

198
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,880
PRESIDENT'S JUDGES, NOT JUST TO

199
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:21,214
THE SUPREME COURT, TWO NEW

200
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:23,750
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, 26

201
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:24,351
CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES.

202
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:26,386
THERE ARE MORE THAT WILL BE DONE

203
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,422
AT THE CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT

204
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:29,923
COURT LEVEL BY THE END OF THE

205
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:30,624
YEAR.

206
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,726
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

207
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,529
WIRE DOING WITH A POSITIVE

208
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,930
IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY.

209
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:37,931
CHRIS:  YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

210
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:39,199
THE MOB AND THE FACT THAT THEY

211
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,866
DIDN'T WIN.

212
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,668
THERE WAS QUITE SOME

213
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:42,769
EXTRAORDINARY SCENES OF

214
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,938
PROTESTERS AND WE ALL VALUE THE

215
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,306
FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHT OF

216
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:47,174
PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS

217
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:49,009
BUT AS YOU WERE COMING THROUGH

218
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,943
THE AIRPORT, THE BEGINNING OF

219
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:53,146
THE WEEK, YOU WERE SURROUNDED BY

220
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:53,647
PROTESTERS.

221
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,015
SOMETIMES THEY WERE BEING

222
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:56,717
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THEY WERE

223
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,953
TRYING TO TALK TO REPORTERS,

224
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:01,455
THEY WERE TRYING TO SHOUT THEM

225
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:01,755
DOWN.

226
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:03,090
THEY CAME TO YOUR HOUSE, OTHER

227
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:03,690
PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

228
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,892
ARE YOU WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT THE

229
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,894
POTENTIAL NOT FOR FAIR STATEMENT

230
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:09,162
OF GRIEVANCES BUT THIS COULD

231
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,797
BECOME A SECURITY RISK.

232
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:16,169
>> WELL, LOOK, IN RETROSPECT I'M

233
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,337
GLAD THEY DID IT.

234
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:21,341
WHAT IT'S DONE, IT'S FIRED UP

235
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:22,542
OUR OWN BASE GOING INTO THE

236
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,745
ELECTION A MONTH FROM NOW.

237
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,646
NOTHING TURNS REPUBLICANS OF ALL

238
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:27,581
STRIPES, WHETHER BUSH

239
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:28,782
REPUBLICANS OR TRUMP

240
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,450
REPUBLICANS, ON LIKE A COURT

241
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:31,084
FIGHT.

242
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:32,652
AND THEY PLAYED RIGHT INTO OUR

243
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,088
HANDS IN RETROSPECT, TURNED THIS

244
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:37,324
INTO A BIG ISSUE, PUT IT FRONT

245
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,959
AND CENTER GOING INTO THE

246
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,260
NOVEMBER ELECTION, UNDERSCORES

247
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:42,129
HOW IMPORTANT KEEPING THE SENATE

248
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,164
IN REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS SO WE

249
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:46,166
CAN CONTINUE TO CONFIRM THE

250
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,001
PRESIDENT'S JUDGES FOR TWO MORE

251
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:48,301
YEARS.

252
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:50,070
SO AS UNPLEASANT AS IT'S BEEN,

253
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:52,272
IT'S BEEN WORTH IT.

254
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:55,108
THEY MADE A TACTICAL MISTAKE

255
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:57,344
THAT HELPED ME UNIFY THE

256
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:58,545
CONFERENCE AND TURN OVER THE

257
00:06:58,546 --> 00:06:59,846
REPUBLICAN BASE GOING INTO THE

258
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:00,213
ELECTION.

259
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:02,215
MAYBE I OUGHT TO SAY THANK YOU.

260
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:04,117
CHRIS:  JUST REAL BRIEFLY,

261
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,853
BECAUSE HAVE YOU TO GET TO THE

262
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:07,788
FLOOR, ANY THOUGHT OF NEW

263
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,489
SECURITY MEASURES BECAUSE THE

264
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,991
FEAR, AND THIS COULD GO EITHER

265
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:14,194
WAY, CONSERVATIVES TO DEMOCRATIC

266
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:15,095
SENATORS, LIBERALS TO REPUBLICAN

267
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:16,263
SENATORS, OF A SECURITY THREAT?

268
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:17,931
>> I THINK IT'S BEST NOT TO TALK

269
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:20,100
ABOUT SECURITY ON THE AIR.

270
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:21,568
CHRIS:  SENATOR McCONNELL,

271
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:22,569
WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE

272
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,272
AND YOU WILL JOIN ME ON FOX NEWS

273
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:25,739
SUNDAY TOMORROW.

274
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,541
I'LL HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

275
00:07:27,542 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
