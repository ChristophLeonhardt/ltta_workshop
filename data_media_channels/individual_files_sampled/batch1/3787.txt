food is good the story is better food with a story that you haven't heard about is better than that and food with the story that you haven't heard about but they can relate to is best of all and when you ask people in markets what they're making you start learning engaging the discussion about food and culture that I just find endlessly fascinating so I'm big on markets I'm big on exploration I'm big on going to the last stop on the subway I mean that figuratively although sometimes it actually is literal but the further you get away from the center of anything when you're out there on the fringes of stuff you learn the most I mean that's where that's where the the freaks and the geeks and you know the alts universe people and the I just find the most fascinating things out on the fringes of society I would encourage people to be curious travelers when we are traveling I believe we become the best versions of ourselves I think the power of travel is transformative we're less risk-averse we ask more questions we have to we're willing to try new things we have experiences and we bring that home and hopefully we don't forget it
