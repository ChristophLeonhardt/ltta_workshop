a megachurch pastor is apologizing for his wife's behavior on social media after she received a considerable amount of criticism for talking smack about those who have been protesting by kneeling during the national anthem hope carpenter was the name of the woman who posted on Facebook and here's what she wrote she said this will not fix racism duh only Jesus if you wanted its back we just thought for a second only Jesus just not just only Jesus yeah duh I don't know what she sounds like and I feel like it's unfair for me to weigh that I think that she said well I think it's fair okay do it please all right this will not fix racism duh only Jesus if you want to kneel that you better be praying to the one and only who can heal our land oh I thought you were gonna go more southern more sure no she sounds like an airhead like that's what she sounds like to me but that's how the way that's the way I read it I don't know what she really sounds she is actually from South Carolina so you were allowed to go more southern there so she also says black athletes she said should stop thinking about it from your own history or race and admit that our country is not yo blame - okay anyway so they got a bunch of heat for that which country is amazing okay we're about to get to it I think an excellent apology if you ask me okay so all right we might disagree on that too but I'm gonna disagree even on the front part not disagree but look the first quote I actually don't have a problem with the second quarter I have a huge problem with the first quote is this will not fix racism now I don't agree with that at all but a lot of people think that oh you're kneeling or a protest doesn't fix anything people say that all the time on all sides like to say that because they don't want any form of protest that's fair and not ever complain about the you know the unfair unequal treatment their community deals with yeah I hear you and then she says only Jesus gonna fix things but they run a mega church they think Jesus fixes everything you got a flat tire Jesus right you got you got pickles in your sandwich when you didn't ask for them Jesus right so I don't agree with that I think it's comical but that's they run a mega church right now the real issue is when she says you know you should stop thinking about just your history or race I mean that is rich with irony so here here are folks saying we are disproportionately shot and killed by police and you're telling me that that's not a problem but that me pointing it out is the problem there's some chance you're only thinking about it from your history or your race so I do I don't want anybody to misunderstand me the sec board is terrible for me yeah I hate I hate both of them um and just to go back to the whole Jesus will fix everything like what do they think that looks like like do they envision that Jesus like let's say they genuinely believed in that religion right and that that God or Jesus is gonna come and do they think he's just gonna show up one day like be like yo everyone racism God well it's a go I don't think yeah I don't think i think it's a lazy argument that christians use typically evangelicals used to keep them from having to critically engage the gospel right which would which would mean that racism is a sin and that you need to check your church and check your own heart and address it and i think particularly in this climate with all of these incidents of racial injustice cropping up that churches have to confront it and they're not and they're falling short so i don't think that they believe jesus i mean i think they I think real Christians believe that Jesus is operating right and met and that he's a part of reconciliation but that he's not going to fix it and then if you were a Christian and Jesus is working through you you gotta fix it right well I mean so that leads to two other things and again that's why I think religions are comical but okay let's go down this path of where is Jesus well if Jesus is in US and he's in the middle of fixing it maybe he's making them new right hey so or if Jesus actually came down and said hey cops stop shooting black people more than white people when they're unarmed you know what they say it was commie idea what they'd reject them in fact there isn't Jewish carpenter right now who's saying please stop shooting them and it's unfair his name is Bernie Sanders and he was by the way literally a carpenter at one point yes okay he's so awesome if he was like my grandpa you helped me remodel the condo and and when they hear a guy saying hey let's be decent to one another let's take care of each other and treat each other equal they're like nah not really so I agree with you on that they're not exactly on point on their gospel I think every makes a really great point because you know sometimes people you know some people will proudly say that they use religion as a crutch because it helps them when they're wounded and emotionally wounded and it gets them through difficult times and then pejoratively people will say you're using religion as a crutch but here they're definitely using it as a crutch and in the negative way now because I think to some extent and they do believe that Jesus will fix everything in it and that's part of D in religious that's part of having faith and that's okay but where the great point that Ambria makes is that is that now they're using it to avoid having a conversation about the very thing that Jesus would add a bare minimum I think he'd at least talk about it I don't think Jesus would be like get up off your knees and stand for the anthem Jesus I think he'd be like well why is everybody getting up like to do salute what like this Allah God okay oh no Otis salute a flag of a country that I'm just guessing that he'd be that would make him uncomfortable right yeah false idol but the government executed you so so falling back and then using religion as a as a as a cudgel no as a yeah yeah to batter people to into not having the conversation that's where it's inappropriate and I'm so glad you said it because now I'm gonna steal that and use it because that really happens all the time well Jesus would be opposed to you stealing it but uh but remember what Jesus did following and I'll give it back right Jesus went into the temple of throughout the money changers what did he do he challenged the established order to seek justice so if you actually believed it you know you'd be a lot more in the in the camp of hey let's talk about these things and let's bring about change okay but finally let's get to the apology because so she didn't do it so I'm not giving her any credit I know she's apparently distraught and emotionally Iraq after the criticism she received online but her husband Ron Carpenter came out I said it's it's been tough he said the things that have been said about us but maybe we deserved it maybe this is a learning moment for us so I'm not gonna tell you to be quiet I'm gonna tell you to teach me and he went on to say we ask you to forgive us if we've hurt you in any way I asked you to teach me what I don't know I don't want to be ignorant yeah I just think that's an excellent that's an apology that's a tenth that's the Michael it's apology scale yeah that's as good as it gets I mean here we are here we were just a second ago talking about well no no if you were a Christian who read the Gospels you would talk about educating yourself and actually getting involved and that's how Jesus acts through you and boom wrong carpenter says yes that's direction I want to go and it's not a thing like I have you like most of the pause if you were offended I guess you're a snowflake but whatever right this is no no I get that you were hurt by this and I and I don't want that to happen I want to help understand where you're coming from so we could work on this together I think that's just
