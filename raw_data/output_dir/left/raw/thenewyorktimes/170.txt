1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,270
Meet Dick and Liz Uihlein.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,770
They spell it like this, but
they spell their company name

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,590
like this. “Uline” — it
sounds familiar, right?

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,970
You’ve probably
used their boxes.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,970
The Wisconsin-based
company has grown

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,010
to be much more than boxes.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,270
It’s a packaging supply giant
with over 6,000 employees.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,610
The family comes
across as unassuming

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,390
in these corporate videos.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,920
But when it comes to politics,
they’re anything but.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,650
The Mercers, the Koch brothers

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,100
and Sheldon Adelson already
have the name recognition,

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,190
but the Uihleins may be the
biggest Republican donors

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,020
you’ve never heard of.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,640
They’re pouring
their massive wealth

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,250
into super PACs backing
insurgent right-wing

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,480
candidates, already
spending roughly $26 million

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,040
on federal elections
this cycle.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,410
Candidates backed
by Uihlein generally

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,100
support the Trump agenda,

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,515
sometimes veering even
further to the right.

22
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:03,635
“A proven conservative
fighting for Mississippi values.”

23
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:06,650
Earlier this year
Mr. Uihlein gave $2.5 million

24
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,790
to Jeanne Ives for governor
in their home state of Illinois.

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,480
She ran this ad against
incumbent Bruce Rauner

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,715
in the primary.

27
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,430
“Thank you for
signing legislation

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,020
that lets me use
the girls bathroom.”

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,610
The ad was criticized
as transphobic.

30
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,870
“That’s exactly what, typically,
a transgender man looks like —”

31
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,130
“No, it’s not.”

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,060
Ives lost.

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,520
“Roy Moore,
leadership we can trust.”

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,420
Mr. Uihlein also gave
over half a million dollars

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,360
to super PACs supporting
Roy Moore in Alabama.

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,320
Moore’s campaign was
compromised when

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,690
several women accused
him of sexually assaulting

38
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,060
them as teens.

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,090
“I trusted Mr. Moore, because
he was the district attorney.”

40
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,560
A Democrat ended up
winning that Senate race.

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,130
Mr. Uihlein contributed
half a million dollars

42
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,820
to a super PAC behind
Patrick Morrisey.

43
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,000
He turned the “drain the swamp”
rallying cry into something

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
resembling a terrorist threat
in this campaign ad.

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,840
“Let's not just
change Washington,

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,140
let’s blow it up
and reinvent it.

47
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,710
That‘s better.”

48
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,690
Morrisey won the Republican
primary in West Virginia,

49
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,540
after President
Trump disparaged

50
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,200
his controversial opponent.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,640
“Mr. President, if you are
watching right now,

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,020
let me tell you:
Your tweet was huge.”

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
Sometimes the Uihleins
support outsider candidates

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,810
who wouldn’t stand a
chance without the money.

55
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,750
Wisconsin voters hadn’t
heard of Kevin Nicholson,

56
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,530
a political newcomer trying to
unseat Democrat Tammy Baldwin,

57
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,080
the first openly gay senator.

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,660
Then Mr. Uihlein
donated over $7 million

59
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,150
to super PACs
supporting Nicholson.

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,580
The Republican Party
has endorsed

61
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,620
a different candidate
in that race.

62
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,840
But polls suggest
that Nicholson is now

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,510
a strong contender.

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,980
The Uihleins spend the most
in their home states

65
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,180
of Illinois and Wisconsin,

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,900
but they fund candidates
across the country.

67
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,640
These megadonations
are helping

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,670
to shape the 2018
elections, while pushing

69
00:03:01,670 --> 00:00:00,000
the Republican Party
further to the right.
