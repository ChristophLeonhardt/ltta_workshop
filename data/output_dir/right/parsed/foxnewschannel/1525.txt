>> WITH THE FBI SPYING ON
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN?
>> NO, THEY WERE NOT.
THEY WERE SPYING ON, A TERM I
DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE, ON WHAT
THE RUSSIANS WERE DOING, TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WERE THE RUSSIANS
INFILTRATING, TRYING TO GAIN
ACCESS AND LEVERAGE AND
INFLUENCE WHICH IS WHAT THEY DO.
>> WHY DOESN'T HE LIKE THAT?
HE SHOULD BE HAPPY.
>> WELL HE SHOULD BE.
AINSLEY: LET'S BRING IN MICHELLE
MALKIN.
THE HOST OF MICHELLE MALKIN
INVESTIGATES ON CRTV.
HEY, MICHELLE.
>> HI.
AINSLEY: SHOULD THE PRESIDENT BE
HAPPY INSIDE THERE WAS A SPY
INSIDE TO MAKE SURE THE RUSSIANS
WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING?
>> ACCORDING TO JOY BEHAR,
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD SEND
FLOWERS AND COOKIES TO ALL OF
THESE FOLKS WHO WERE ESSENTIALLY
HIJACKING OUR INTELLIGENCE AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO TURN
THOSE INSTITUTIONS INTO WHAT I
CONSIDER A MASSIVE VOTER
DISENFRANCHISEMENT PROGRAM.
THIS IS REALLY WHAT IS AT STAKE
HERE AND WHY I BELIEVE OUR
PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT,
THAT "SPYGATE" COULD TURN OUT TO
BE THE MOST SCANDALOUS THING
THAT HAS HAPPENED IN WASHINGTON
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT ABOUT
PROTECTING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,
AS JAMES CLAPPER, OBNOXIOUSLY
TRIES TO ARGUE ON TV AND
EVERYWHERE ELSE.
THIS WAS ABOUT UPENDING A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AND
TRYING TO DELEGITIMATIZE HIM
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING EVER
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY ALARMING.
WHERE IS THE LEFT, THESE ARE THE
PEOPLE THAT BALKED AT THE IDEA
OF THE FBI SENDING INFORMANTS
AND INFILTRATING, FOR EXAMPLE,
THE ANTIWAR MOVEMENT.
THE ACLU WAS ALL OVER THAT.
NOW HERE THEY ARE TRYING TO CALL
SPYING SOMETHING OTHER THAN
SPYING, LOOKING THE OTHER WAY?
AND EXPECTING THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR
WHAT HAPPENED?
STEVE: I KNOW.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO REFERRED TO
MR. CLAPPER AS A LYING MACHINE
WHO NOW WORKS AT CNN.
REMEMBER HE FAMOUSLY WITH
SENATOR WYDEN WAS ASKING HIM
ABOUT THE NSA PROGRAM, HE SAID,
NOPE, WE DON'T COLLECT DATA ON A
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS.
HE LATER SAID THAT THE ANSWER HE
GAVE WAS THE LEAST UNTRUTHFUL
ONE HE COULD GIVE.
BUT THEN HE LATER SAID, ALL
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR DEFINITION
OF COLLECTION IS.
NOW HE SAYS HE DIDN'T TELL A
LIE.
HE WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THE
PROGRAM.
HE HAS A MILLION STORIES.
>> YEAH HE DOES.
HE IS A LIAR, HE IS A LEAKER AND
A CRAP WEASEL.
TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF IT.
YOU KNOW,, I THINK MOST ORDINARY
AMERICANS WHO ARE NOT FOLLOWING
EVERY TWIST AND TURN IN THIS
ODYSSEY ARE PROBABLY JUST
STUNNED TO KNOW THAT INCOMPETENT
CLOWNS LIKE THIS WERE RUNNING
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.
BRIAN: SO, MICHELLE?
>> YES.
BRIAN: LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S
ADVOCATE A SECOND.
YOU FIND OUT.
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
RUSSIANS INFILTRATING OUR
ELECTION.
YOU'RE JAMES COMEY, YOU'RE JAMES
CLAPPER, AND JOHN BRENNAN.
ALL OF SUDDEN SEE MANAFORT NAME
GO ON THE ROSTER FOR TRUMP.
CARTER PAGE GOES ON ROSTER FOR
TRUMP.
THEN PAPADOPOULOS, THAT THEY
HAVE TANGENTIAL LINKS WITH THE
RUSSIANS OR UKRAINE IN THAT
AREA.
THEY DECIDE TO PUT SOMEONE IN
TRYING TO HEAR WHAT IS GOING ON,
TO ELICIT INFORMATION THEY BRING
TO THE CAMPAIGN.
DOES THAT SOUND LOGICAL TO YOU?
>> CONGRATULATIONS BRIAN, DOING
YOUR BEST TO PLAY DEVIL'S
ADVOCATE THERE BUT THIS WAS NOT
WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT.
AS I SAID THE OTHER DAY, THE
REASON WHY THIS IS SO
PROBLEMATIC, AND SUCH A DANGER
AND A MENACE TO OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC, IS
BECAUSE THIS WAS A CONSPIRACY
BETWEEN THE POLICE STATE, THE
FOURTH ESTATE, AND THIS, THIS
CRIMINAL DEEP STATE THAT HAD AT
ITS GOAL NOT TO PROTECT AMERICAN
SAFETY AND SOVEREIGNTY BUT TO
BRING DOWN A PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE.
THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
TARGETING CANDIDATE TRUMP, AND
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP.
AND THEY HAVE NOT YIELDED.
THEY WILL NOT STOP UNTIL THEY
TEAR THIS COUNTRY APART.
STEVE: OBVIOUSLY IF THEY WANTED,
THE THREE NAMES, BRIAN, YOU
GAVE, THEY UNDOUBTEDLY ALL HAD
THEIR PHONES TAPPED.
NSA CAN SURVEIL THIS KIND OF
THING.
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT
HAPPENED.
WE KNOW A FISA WARRANT WAS
OBTAINED FOR CARTER PAGE A
NUMBER OF TIMES.
SUDDENLY, MICHELLE WHEN THE
PRESIDENT OVER A YEAR AGO,
TWEETED OUT I WAS WIRETAPPED,
NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.
>> YEAH.
HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE BUSH YEARS AND THE OBAMA
YEARS.
REMEMBER THAT THE LEFT WAS UP IN
HIGH DUDGON, AND
"NEW YORK TIMES" WAS LEAKING
LIKE A SIEVE USING ALL SOURCES
TO BRING DOWN THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, WHEN IT WAS
USING THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS
FOR LEGITIMATE PURPOSES TO TRY
TO PROTECT US FROM TERRORISM.
WHAT HAPPENED IT MORPHED INTO A
PROGRAM WHERE OUR INTEL AND LAW
AN FORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE
HIJACKED FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES.
AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE
CLAPPER ON CNN AND BRENNAN AND
ALL OF THESE BLABBERMOUTHS AS I
CALL THEM, IT IS CONDUCT THAT IS
UNBECOMING OF PEOPLE WHO WERE
ONCE IN CHARGE OF OUR
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, THAT WERE
MEANT TO PROTECT AMERICAN
CITIZENS.
BRIAN: SOMETHING ABOUT THE
INVESTIGATION IS HITTING A
NERVE.
BRENNAN IS UNHINGED.
CLAPPER SEEMS DESPERATE AND MORE
