1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,420
Four million!

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,580
We can't believe it.

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,340
Really cool, four million. Started from the

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,660
bottom now we here.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,180
Woooooo

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,360
Is thank you one word or
two?

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,820
It's one word.

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,580
So we have a treat for you,

9
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,120
our loyal subscribers.

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,730
So we're making a
video about all the questions you had

11
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,680
about the team.

12
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,660
Anything that you wanted
so let's get right to it.

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,280
so a lot of you want to know where a lot
of the producers have been.

14
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,900
Since the beginning of this year we've been at
work on the biggest project we've ever

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,800
undertaken.

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,420
We've been working on a
new show for Netflix!

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,000
It's called

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,220
"Explained" and it's gonna start on May 23rd.

19
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,180
That's all you get for now.

20
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,780
May 23rd, see you there.

21
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,829
Peter from the US wants to know will you

22
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,120
answer this question?

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
Will you answer
this question?

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,200
Will you answer this -- YES!

25
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,960
So Brian from

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,847
Argentina wants to know: how you choose
your stories?

27
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,100
Based on personal

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,730
experience, so if there's something that
really annoys me or frustrates me.

29
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,620
Stories that can only be explained on a
map.

30
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,260
What can we show, what can we point a

31
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,380
camera at, what can we animate, what makes
a good video is what makes something visual.

32
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,500
Tell the story to a friend, if
then it still feels interesting then I

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,360
know it's interesting.

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,060
Do your friends
like dread you coming to dinner, they're like

35
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,260
here comes Christophe...

36
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,360
Christopher from the United
States wants to know: what's the oddest

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,320
thing you've you've ever done for a
video?

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,520
I feel like you do an odd thing in every video.

39
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,100
I interviewed a professional
regurgitator.

40
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,440
Climbed into a bear cave.

41
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,600
Throwing glitter at you,

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,900
throwing a football at you,

43
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,860
throwing balloons at you.

44
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,900
You throw a lot of stuff at me. I know.

45
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,290
I don't know the oddest

46
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,159
thing, but I think the most extraordinary
thing was visiting a migrant camp for

47
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,760
Borders.

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,200
Look up the sizes of all of the ape and human

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
testicles that exist.

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,580
Alec from the
United States asks: what led you to working

51
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,480
at Vox as opposed to any other site?

52
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,600
To me Vox is pretty even-keeled and

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,160
balanced and considers both sides of the
argument.

54
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,500
Johnny Harris hired me.

55
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I think Vox is doing the coolest video
on the internet right now.

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,340
When Vox was

57
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,540
first announced, they had this concept:
the thing that's new isn't necessarily

58
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,820
the thing that's important.

59
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,220
I was really drawn to that.

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,420
Robert from Poland

61
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,640
wants to know if you know what Vox means?

62
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,600
It literally means voice.

63
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,620
Vox is Latin for

64
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,260
George Soros.

65
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,620
It actually means "free
La Croix in the break room."

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,760
I think that

67
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,840
it means that Vox media was kind of
built around the idea of highlighting

68
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,600
lots and lots of people's voices.

69
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,860
Alec Bowman from the United States asked if

70
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,340
we're owned by a bigger company.

71
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,380
Yeah, Vox.com is a part of Vox media. It's a

72
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,940
bunch of sister sites like The Verge, SB
Nation, Eater, Racked, Curbed.

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Polygon.

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,780
Oh yeah, Polygon. Polygon's dope.

75
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,780
There are a lot of video makers at Vox Media

76
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,080
Vox.com is just one channel so go
check them out.

77
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,510
Colin wants to know if

78
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,840
you'll go on a date with him?

79
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,760
No.

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,840
Not again.

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,720
Not after what happened last time.

82
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,400
Madeline wants to know what your favorite emoji
is Dean.

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
The shrimp one.

84
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,880
How do you use that?

85
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,940
With the tophat emoji a lot.

86
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,170
I'm almost more curious which ones you

87
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,880
wouldn't use it with because I can't think of one.

88
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,980
Jamin from India wants to know where all

89
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,120
of us are from.

90
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,720
So let's pull up a map.

91
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,820
We're starting
in New York.

92
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,000
New Jersey, Philadelphia,

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,580
Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois,
Minnesota, Seattle, Oregon.

94
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,960
Isn't that the same thing?

95
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,340
Seattle and Oregon?

96
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,460
California, Arizona,

97
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:51,480
Texas, Alabama, Florida, Virginia, Maryland,
Madrid, Vancouver, and Korea and Delhi, India.

98
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,280
A lot of you have asked what are
some of the challenges of making Borders.

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,909
Just the fact that you come up with this
story and this idea and then when you

100
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:03,989
show up, the lines are always so much
more blurrier than the neat structure

101
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,820
that you had in mind before you went.

102
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,650
I think this is a good thing from a

103
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,769
reporting perspective, to have much more
rigor and kind of local information, so

104
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,480
while they're challenging they make
Borders much better.

105
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,029
Why don't you all tell us like what you use

106
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,019
for animation?

107
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,820
After effects. After Effects. My imagination.

108
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,100
That's what you use for animation?

109
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,600
Yes.

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,840
Are people above 30 allowed to work

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,480
at Vox?

112
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,099
Yeah definitely, I mean you've got
a whole range of people. You've got people who

113
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:36,710
are 23 like me and then you've got
people who are a lot of older, too, so.

114
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,460
Pretty much anybody.

115
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,260
Jacob from the United States wants to know: should I get a job in media?

116
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,250
Students: the advice I
would give is like a lot of the skills

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,562
that you need to work in media

118
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,620
are actually skills that you can build up

119
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,940
without working in media.

120
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,370
You should get
a job in media if you are passionate

121
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,680
about the news and you're passionate
about sharing information with people.

122
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,340
Do you have any music recommendations?
That's a good one.

123
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,800
No. I don't listen to music.

124
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,800
A bunch of people asked how we make
money.

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,460
It's pretty simple, on YouTube we

126
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,880
make money by selling ads.

127
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,770
There are
actually ads besides pre-roll that we

128
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,090
should tell you about.

129
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,330
So first one is
editorial sponsorships, like in Earworm

130
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,060
you saw a "Presented by Toyota Camry" bug at
the top corner of the video.

131
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,720
That means

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,389
that they paid to be in the video and
they have no editorial say.

133
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:34,840
We didn't owe anything to Toyota Camry
except the final version of the video.

134
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,740
We all got a Camry.

135
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,780
Yeah I drive a Camry now.

136
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,160
Thank you Toyota.

137
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,339
Really good sound quality in the
speakers.

138
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,740
Who would be both of your dream

139
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,540
sponsors?

140
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,100
Panera, probably.

141
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,060
We've been angling for a Panera

142
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:48,040
sponsorship for my videos for a while.

143
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,639
I don't want them to sponsor me because  it's

144
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,920
a conflict of interest.

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,700
Because I just
got there too often.

146
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,539
The other way we

147
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,629
make money is through branded content
and we actually have a whole separate

148
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,640
team who works on branded content.

149
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,960
Our team, all the people you see in this

150
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,560
video don't make those videos, but there
are other people in our company who do.

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,949
They're called the explainer studio and
they've taken a lot of the cool things

152
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,690
that we've invented through our
experimentations Vox video and apply it

153
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,560
to brands.

154
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,530
If there is a piece of branded
content on our channel, it will always

155
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,280
say "advertiser content" in the title.

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,300
That is worth paying for our videos right now.

157
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,060
So thank you for supporting us and I
hope we do get to make you more videos.

158
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,560
Three, two one.

159
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,340
Thank you all so much for watching Vox.

160
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,040
It's so awesome that
there's four million of you.

161
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,920
Five million, see you at five million.

162
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,580
Alright, bye.

163
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,540
Thanks for watching Vox.

164
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,920
Thanks for watching us at Vox.

165
00:06:41,920 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching this video
that's eight minutes long.
