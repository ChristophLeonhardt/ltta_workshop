FIRST, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT ED HENRY LIVE WITH THE BREAKING DETAILS AND A VERY HEATED PHONE CALL. YOU ARE RIGHT. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEVIN CLOSED DOORS AT NOON EASTERN TOMORROW. ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED NOW UNDER PRESSURE FROM DEMOCRATS WOULD JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S THING THERE WILL BE A SECOND MEETING WITH DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS ABOUT 2:00 P.M. EASTERN. I GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH DEVIN NUNES. HE'S FIRED UP. HE BELIEVES THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S PLAYING AROUND WITH THESE DIFFERENT MEANINGS TO TRY TO MAY BE MAKE IT LIKE THERE WAS DAYLIGHT BETWEEN NUNES AND SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES. MAYBE DIFFERENT INFORMATION WOULD BE DISCUSSED. HE TOLD ME THE LAST MINUTE CHANGE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS "WEAK AND PATHETIC." HE SAID YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON THAT. HE ADDED "I WILL BE THERE AT 2:00 P.M. TO WATCH WHAT THEY SAY TO MAKE SURE IT IS THE SAME INTEL, SAME INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SPYING ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN." HE WANTS TO FIND THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL. HE ADDED "THIS IS WHY AMERICANS NO LONGER TRUST THESE GUYS, MEANING AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, SEE YOU AT 2:00 P.M.." AT NOON, NEWNESS AND TREY GOWDY MEETING WITH THE FBI DIRECTOR CHRIS WRAY, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN. OTHER TOP OFFICIALS DIG DEEP ON WHETHER THERE WAS ONE OR MORE INFORMANT TRYING TO PENETRATE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. AT 2:00 P.M., THE GANG OF EIGHT, FOUR DEMOCRATS AND FOUR REPUBLICANS WILL GO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS FOR A SIMILAR BRIEFING. AMID SIGNS OF THE PRESSURE FROM THE PRESIDENT IN RECENT DAYS SUCCEEDING IN TURNING THE TABLES ON OBAMA OFFICIALS BECAUSE ALSO KNEW TONIGHT, JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TELLING PBS THAT THE INTENT WAS NOT TO SPY ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. BUT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE DOING. A MILE APART FROM MARCH OF 2017 WHEN THE PRESIDENT CHARGED THAT OBAMA OFFICIALS HAD CONDUCTED SURVEILLANCE. CLAPPER FALSELY CLAIMED IT WAS NOT TRUE AT ALL. THERE IS NO SURVEILLANCE. NOW HE IS SAYING THE INTENT WAS NOT TO SPY, LEAVING THE DOOR OPENED ALL KINDS OF THINGS. ALL OF THIS LEADING THE PRESIDENT TO CALL CLAPPER A LYING MACHINE AND HE ADDED TODAY WAS A GOOD THING FOR THE COUNTRY THAT IF OUR JAMES COMEY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE CALLED THE FORMER FBI CHIEF'S "LIES." COMEY PUSHED BACK. HE, LIKE CLAPPER, SEEMED TO SHIFT HIS STORY. COMEY ACKNOWLEDGING SOME KIND OF SURVEILLANCE OCCURRED BUT TREATING "FACTS MATTER. THE FBI'S USE OF CONFIDENTIAL HUMAN SOURCES IS TIGHTLY REGULATED AND ESSENTIAL TO PROTECTING THE COUNTRY. ATTACKS ON THE FBI AND LYING ABOUT ITS WORK WILL DO LASTING DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY. HOW WILL REPUBLICANS EXPLAIN THIS TO THEIR GRANDCHILDREN?" IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WANTS THE TRUTH. LISTEN. President Trump: WE NOW CALL IT SPYGATE. YOU ARE CALLING IT SPYGATE. A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. I WANT THEM ALL TO GET TOGETHER. THEY WILL SIT IN THE ROOM. HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT. WE ARE NOT UNDERCUTTING. WE'RE CLEANING EVERYTHING UP. WHAT I WANT IS I WANT TOTAL TRANSPARENCY. NO ONE SHOULD TRUST ANYTHING THEY SAY COMING OUT OF THAT MEETING. I DON'T CARE WHO COMES. I'M NOT IN CONTROL OF THE INVITE LIST. THE ONLY THING I WOULD ASK IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW UP, SHOW UP WITH AN OPEN MIND AND CLOSED LIPS. CLOSED LIPS, SEEMS LIKE IT'S A STRETCH THAT THERE WILL BE CLOSED LIPS AND NO LEAKS. OPEN MINDS, MAY BE AN EVEN STEEPER CLIMB. Shannon: JUST TO RECAP, BUT BECAUSE NOT LONG AGO WE GOT THIS INFORMATION. THE INTEL BRIEFING THAT THEY ARE PUSHING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOURCE WHO WAS REPORTING BACK TO THE FBI. IN RESPONSE TO A SUBPOENA FROM DEVIN NUNES. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY HE IS FIRED UP. THIS IS A MEETING HE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WITH SPEED 24 AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND FBI OFFICIALS. IT'S A SUBPOENA THAT NUNES PUSHED. Shannon: THAT MEETING IS HAPPENING AT 12:00. THEN WE HAVE A LIST HAPPENING AT 2:00. THE SAME PLAYERS, INCLUDING THE GANG OF EIGHT. INCLUDING NUNES. Shannon: HE IS NOT ON THE LIST AT THE SECOND MEETING. THAT IS KEY. IT'S INTERESTING TO THE BECAUSE LITERALLY I DIDN'T SEE THAT LIST BECAUSE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH NUNES AS IT WAS BEING PUT OUT. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY HE'S ANGRY. YOU ARE RIGHT. SOMEHOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND FBI SEEMS TO THINK THAT IF THE SECOND MEETING, NUNES WILL NOT ATTEND. Shannon: HE IS PLANNING ON GOING. HE'S PLANNING ON GOING. HE SAID I WILL SEE YOU AT 2:00 P.M. BECAUSE HE'S A MEMBER OF THE GANG OF EIGHT. HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTEL, GANG OF EIGHT, INSIDER WASHINGTON TERM. TOP REPUBLICAN, TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE INTEL AND SENATE INTEL. BOTTOM LINE IS SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO SAY NUNES IS GOING TO GET ONE MEETING AND THEN WE WILL TELL THE OTHER LEADERS IN CONGRESS MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE. I DON'T KNOW IF NUNES IS GOING UP TO BARGE IN.
