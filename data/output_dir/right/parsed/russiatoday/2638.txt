the other thing is I've always seemed to
get for whatever reason a
disproportionate amount of press or
media and not my whole life
somebody will explain someday why but
I've always gotten a lot and as a
businessman I was always treated really
well by the press you know the numbers
speak and things happen but I've always
really had a very good press and it was
until I became a politician that I
realized how nasty how mean how vicious
and how fake the press can be as the
cameras start going off in the
background but but overall I'm in the
bottom line somebody said well they
couldn't have been that bad because here
we are we're president and I think we're
doing a really great job with my team I
have a team of just tremendous people
