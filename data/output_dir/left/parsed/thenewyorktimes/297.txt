I served as a Navy
SEAL for 20 years.
I deployed 13 times, and a
couple of those deployments
to Afghanistan and Iraq.
I’m transgender.
And as you look at
me right now you
might see a dude with long hair.
You can have Kristin
with a dress on,
and I can still kick ass.
President Trump’s sudden and
sweeping ban using Twitter,
tweeting he will ban
transgender people
from serving in the
military in any capacity.
On that, the decision is
based on a military decision.
It’s not meant to be
anything more than that.
I was pretty upset.
And I call fault on that.
This is a political decision.
There’s many transgender
people serving right now.
Thousands.
They’ve had
estimates from 2,000,
all the way up to possibly
15,000 transgender people are
currently serving in uniform.
The United Kingdom, Israel,
Norway, Sweden, the Canadians,
Australia, already have
open transgender service,
and America, the
home of the free,
we’re not going to allow
open transgender service?
Just doesn’t make sense.
President Trump tweeted it would
be tremendous medical costs
for transgender soldiers.
The costs in a RAND study were
theoretically at $8.4 million.
The military spent
alone over $80 million
on erectile dysfunction,
$40 million on Viagra alone.
$40 million.
Here’s the bottom line.
Transgender Americans like
myself, we are capable,
and we are worthy to
serve in the US military.
I don’t need dresses and makeup.
I don’t need anything.
If this ban is
allowed to stand,
then I challenge and I
call out every congressman
and every general officer,
retired and active,
to stand up.
Stand up for worthy Americans,
that we are capable,
and we want to serve.
Stand up for us.
Fight for us.
