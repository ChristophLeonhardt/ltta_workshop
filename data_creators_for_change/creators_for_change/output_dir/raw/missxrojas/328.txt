00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
hi guys take the second part<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mondays</font>

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,080
video what's going down in October why

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,400
it's where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only purpose is</font>

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,859
exaggeration like hilarious<font color="#E5E5E5"> where was</font>

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,360
the last time hilarious was used for

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,370
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is actually hilarious I</font>

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,440
feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hilarious is only ok when used</font>

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,179
in a sarcastic context because people

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,680
just you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just doing it</font>

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,060
wrong they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just doing the word from</font>

11
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,070
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hurts me guys it just really</font>

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,660
hurts I realized that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is funny</font>

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,100
coming from a nerdfighter but this is

14
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,210
similar to the way in which the word

15
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,130
awesome is used like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just used all</font>

16
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,779
the time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that aren't awesome</font>

17
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,820
that don't inspire all that aren't even

18
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that cool the worst when hilarious is</font>

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,450
used at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> start of the story that just</font>

20
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,940
isn't funny to anyone involved it's just

21
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">some weird thing that happened also</font>

22
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">going down cameras running out of</font>

23
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,079
battery because I've got charged them

24
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,910
before go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work we worry about and two</font>

25
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later she returned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to future</font>

26
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,440
self charge<font color="#CCCCCC"> your camera anyway so number</font>

27
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,570
two men winking once<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon a time I used</font>

28
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,340
to find it slightly attractive but a man

29
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,989
would work it meant something mysterious

30
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,149
something made just for me but now I

31
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,370
seem to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more uncomfortable and</font>

32
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,960
also just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a bit like I'm not</font>

33
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,579
entirely sure like what you just try try

34
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,140
to say like doesn't really help that in

35
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,489
the most recent encounters of men

36
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,960
winking they seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wake in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

37
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,850
inappropriate situations are you when

38
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,770
their wife or girlfriend or other

39
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,630
partner is standing right there but it's

40
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,490
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> the absence of knowing exactly what</font>

41
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,900
else it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're trying to</font>

42
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,610
say with that wink I don't mean the

43
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,590
semicolon close bracket variety of<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

44
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,900
i do just mean the in person<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

45
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,330
unprompted wink<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am of course i found</font>

46
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,619
on the internet week because it does

47
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,930
involve semicolons and I love semicolons

48
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,930
with a passion going down part<font color="#CCCCCC"> three hot</font>

49
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,610
water bottles hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> water bottles have</font>

50
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,409
always been problematic for me blush it

51
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,700
because you have to fill them up in the

52
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,259
sink and sink was never quite deep

53
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,610
enough to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole hot water</font>

54
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,380
bottle so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are those many</font>

55
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,060
many tiny ones that just did nothing

56
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,070
anyway you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to force it all around</font>

57
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,659
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would spill out and it would</font>

58
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,280
never typically spill over your bathroom

59
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,630
and you had to clean up with a towel

60
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,159
before your mother got angry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

61
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,270
the towel would be wet and there's a

62
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,700
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bulava oh I feeling very stressed</font>

63
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,619

68
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,759
wasting all that excess<font color="#CCCCCC"> heat is pumping</font>

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,170
week

71
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,850
I had a need for a hot water bottle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

76
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,890
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> final thing that's going down is</font>

77
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,569
cheating<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's genius had a great moment</font>

78
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,099
they had all their colors our display

79

<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone wore than for summer it was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">great it was Mary everyone drank pins it</font>

81
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,090

82
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,160
autumn as everyone keeps reminding me

83
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,630
seriously if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking for mining</font>

84
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,890
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be happy about the</font>

85
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,510
fact that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting cold and dark and</font>

86
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,010
worked and everything's dying and

87
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,590
especially so pretty LLL<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah no I'm</font>

88
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,730
sad about it and I didn't wanna talk

89
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it we can't keep on with this</font>

90
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,110
chinos nonsense it's how it's time it's

91
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,750
time is past can we put chinos in the

92
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,370
past and return to genes and genes and

93
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,640
suit trousers and that's all the people

94
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that work also helps people can wear</font>

95
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,450
kilts that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I like the color was</font>

96
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,310
embraced and I like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people drove</font>

97
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,750
for that but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other ways to</font>

98
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,500
express color as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email shut and dip</font>

99
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,019
dyed denim that supposedly calls back to

100
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,489
the 90s because the 90s are now

101
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:07,989
apparently vintage which is depressing

102
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,810
in itself might I say I'm just done but

103
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,420
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just done but I'm just done but I am</font>

104
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,920
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> done with chinos go fuck yourself</font>

105
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,269
so that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

this month let me know what you think is

107
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,260
going out of fashion or just shouldn't

108
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,910
be used or just generally makes you want

109
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,820
to punch a wall in the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

110
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,989
