I mean I'd like to think that we're in the midst of a relationship revolution where everything is being accepted and is is okay it seems like that's where the culture said it there's no scientific basis for monogamy there's not really an evolutionary basis relationships aren't working look at all the men cheating on Ashley Madison over 90% of people are unhappy after the birth of their first child in their relationship close to four out of ten people don't believe in marriage anymore so I thought why are we still doing this I'm gonna find a better type of relationship I couldn't make monogamy work for me so I got into polyamory I tried an open relationship I tried the swinging scene and everyone failed more miserably than monogamy because if you think about it it's hard enough to have a relationship with one person having relationship with three people is gonna be three times as difficult where I stand on monogamy and on monogamy is that they're just artificial made-up distinctions you know the universe doesn't know what monogamy is I'm gonna be his right I spoke with Stephanie Coontz who's the world leading historian on marriage and if you look at the concept of marriage it just changes over time marriage was never for love originally marriage was about merging resources maybe that's can create some extra field hands together maybe you and your your family or wife's family can merge your property and it was really a strategic commercial economic institution and it wasn't till like the 17th century maybe early 18th century where marriage became about love the idea of love right before maybe you would even find your sex outside marriage in the nineteen sixties seventies it became finally an equal partnership not this kind of male breadwinner model it's still being worked out and still being changed now we're a weird place where we're really open to people's sexuality and we're really kind of down on cheating makes total sense so now maybe we have to negotiate these new kinds of marriages and other kinds of relationships and I think we're Stephanie Coontz says we're at is that we're gonna pick and choose design your own relationship situation so all the rules are off the table and you both design or the money they get for you there are design what's right for you
