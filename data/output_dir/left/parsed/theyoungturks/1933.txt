A QUICK VIDEO
OF VALERIE PLAME RESPONDING
TO THIS PARDON, LET'S TAKE A
QUICK LOOK.
>>THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT ABOUT
ME, IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT ABOUT
SCOOTER LIBBY, IT'S ABOUT DONALD
TRUMP AND HIS FUTURE.
IT'S VERY
CLEAR THAT THIS IS A MESSAGE
HE'S SENDING, THAT YOU CAN
COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST NATIONAL
SECURITY AND YOU WILL BE
PARDONED.
SO I THINK HE'S GOT AN
AUDIENCE OF THREE RIGHT NOW,
THAT WOULD BE MANAFORT, FLYNN,
AND KUSHNER.
AND PERHAPS OTHERS.
THE MESSAGE BEING SENT IS YOU
CAN COMMIT PERJURY AND I WILL
PARDON YOU IF IT PROTECTS ME AND
I DEEM THAT YOU ARE LOYAL TO ME.
I THINK THE MESSAGE IS VERY
DAMAGING TO OUR DEMOCRACY
AND THE RULE OF LAW.
>>AND LET'S NOT FORGET,
VALERIE PLAME WAS OUTED BECAUSE
HER HUSBAND, JOE WILSON, TALKED
ABOUT THE YELLOWCAKE AND SAID
THAT WE SHOULDN'T GO INTO IRAQ.
SO IT WAS A VINDICTIVE MOVE TO
LEAK HER NAME AND PUT HER LIFE
AT RISK.
SO IT ALL JUST GOES
BACK TO, LIKE, LISTEN, I KEEP
SAYING, OBVIOUSLY I'M ON THE
LEFT POLITICALLY, BUT IF SOMEONE
COMES TO ME AND GOES LOOK AT THE
STUFF THAT PEOPLE ON THE LEFT
DID TO OUT SOMEBODY OR TO PUT
SOMEONE'S LIFE IN DANGER, I'M
GOING TO ADMIT IT, I WILL GO,
YOU ARE RIGHT.
IF YOU SAY UNDER
OBAMA THERE WERE A LOT OF DRONE
ATTACKS, THERE WERE.
I WILL
ACCEPT THAT.
IT'S CRAZY TO ME
HOW ON THE RIGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE
SIT THERE AND GO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS WAS A GOOD THING, THIS GUY
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT BAD.
HE
PUT SOMEONE'S LIFE AT RISK WHO
WAS AN OPERATIVE AND THE ONLY
REASON WHY WAS BECAUSE OF THE
VINDICTIVENESS, THAT HE HAD THE
BALLS OR THE GALL TO SAY THAT
THE WAR WITH IRAQ WASN'T RIGHT.
>>CENK AND I TALK ABOUT THAT
ALL THE TIME, HOW ON THE LEFT WE
HAVE INCURRED LEHIGH STANDARDS
FOR ONE ANOTHER AND IF SOMEONE
DOES SOMETHING WRONG WE HAVE NO
PROBLEM CALLING THAT INDIVIDUAL
OUT, WHETHER IT HAS TO DO WITH
SOMEONE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT OR DOING SOMETHING
ILLEGAL WHILE IN GOVERNMENT OR
IN OFFICE, WE ARE READY AND
WILLING TO CALL THEM OUT, AND WE
CALLED OUT OBAMA FOR THOSE DRONE
STRIKES OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
BUT
THE RIGHT IS SO LOYAL TO ONE
ANOTHER, THEY DON'T CARE, THEY
WILL STICK BY ONE ANOTHER NO
MATTER WHAT, THERE ARE NO
STANDARDS OR PRINCIPLES
WHATSOEVER.
>>ON MY SHOW WE HAVE SORT OF
ADOPTED THE RULE THAT WE CAN'T
KEEP SAYING WHAT IF OBAMA HAD
DONE THIS?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT?
EVERY FREAKING DAY, WHAT
IF OBAMA HAD PAID OFF A PORN
STAR $130,000?
GET OUT OF HERE.
>>BILL, I TRY NOT TO DO IT BUT
I DID IT TWO DAYS AGO ON THE
TWEETS.
THE TWEETS ARE SO
MANIACAL, THE MCCAIN TWEET TODAY
WHERE HE'S SCREAMING AT THE TOP
OF HIS LUNGS LIKE A PETULANT
CHILD, ANY ONE OF THOSE TWEETS
FROM OBAMA WOULD HAVE LAUNCHED A
DOZEN CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATIONS AND PROBABLY 25TH
AMENDMENT HEARINGS, LIKE IS THIS
MAN LOST HIS MIND?
>>LET ALONE THE PRESIDENT
CALLING SOMEONE A SLIMEBALL.
>>IT FEELS LIKE, WE HAVE SEEN
THIS WHERE THERE'S AN ABUSIVE
BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND IN A
RELATIONSHIP WITH A GIRL AND YOU
SEE IT IN YOU'RE LIKE, WHY DON'T
YOU GET OUT OF THIS?
I FEEL LIKE
REPUBLICANS ARE THE ABUSED
GIRLFRIEND AND THIS GUY IS THE
ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND.
DON'T YOU SEE
HOW CRAZY THIS TWEET IS?
A TWEET
ABOUT MAYBE WE WILL ATTACK SYRIA
IN THE FUTURE --
>>MAYBE IT WILL BE SOON,
MAYBE A LONG TIME FROM NOW.
I'M PARAPHRASING.
>>WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S EVERY DAY
LIKE YOU SAID, 10 TWEETS A DAY.
REPUBLICANS THAT ARE WATCHING
THIS, PLEASE JUST LOOK AT THE
FACTS AND SIT THERE FOR A SECOND
AND GO, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I
STILL ADHERE TO REPUBLICAN
PRINCIPLES, BUT THIS DUDE IS NOT
GOOD FOR THE WORLD.
HE'S BAD.
>>BUT THE REASON THEY DON'T,
THEY KNOW THAT, LOOK AT THE
ANONYMOUS CONGRESSMAN WHO TALKS
TO ERICK ERICKSON THE OTHER DAY,
SAYING HE'S AN EVIL EFFING
FORREST GUMP, AND A DUMB ONE AT
THAT.
FORREST GUMP WAS MENTALLY
DAMAGED, AND HE'S WORSE THAN
THAT.
SO 
THEY KNOW.
THE PROBLEM
IS, THEIR BASE IS EITHER EQUALLY
STUPID OR JUST DOESN'T CARE THAT
HE'S MANIACALLY STUPID.
BECAUSE
THEY SEE THOSE TWEETS, IT'S NOT
LIKE PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT
THE TWEETS, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY
CAN'T SEE THEM WITH THEIR OWN
EYES, THEY DO, AND THEY ALL
AGREE NOT THAT THE EMPEROR
DOESN'T HAVE CLOTHES -- HE
DOESN'T HAVE CLOTHES BUT THEY
SAY YES HE DOES.
THEY USED TO DO
THAT WITH GEORGE BUSH, THIS GUY
IS FINE, HE CAN PUT SENTENCES
TOGETHER.
NO HE CAN'T, IT'S
SUPER OBVIOUS.
IN THIS CASE THEY
HAVE AGREED THAT THE EMPEROR HAS
A MIND WHEN IT'S CLEAR THE
EMPEROR HAS NO MIND.
HE'S LOST
HIS MIND COMPLETELY.
AND THERE
ARE 33% OF THE COUNTRY WHO WILL
NOT MOVE, WHO LOOK AT A MAN WHO
IS CLEARLY MENTALLY UNBALANCED
AND GOES, NAILED IT.
AND WE HAVE TO RESPECT THOSE
GUYS, IT'S MADNESS.
>>THEY NOT ONLY TOLERATE THESE
TWEETS, THEY LOVE IT.
>>I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.
>>THEY THINK THEY SENT HIM THERE
TO SHAKE THEM UP AND TAKE THEM
ALL ON, REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE SICK, I
THINK, BUT THEY LOVE THEM.
THE
TRUEST THING DONALD TRUMP EVER
SAID WAS THAT OLD LINE ABOUT I
COULD GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF
FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY
AND NOBODY WOULD DO ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE IS DEAD RIGHT
ON THAT.
>>HE WAS RIGHT ON THAT.
AND ALSO
YOU HAVE THE BUBBLE THAT THE
TRUMP BASE LIVES IN. AND WHAT I
MEAN BY THAT IS, THE TYPE OF
NEWS CONTENT THEY CONSUME.
SO
THE NEWS CONTENT THEY CONSUME
JUSTIFIES THE TYPES OF TWEETS HE
PUTS OUT THERE, BECAUSE HE
PRESENTS HIMSELF AS A VICTIM,
SOMEONE WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF A
WITCHHUNT, AND THEN ALL YOU HEAR
ON FOX NEWS AND BREITBART AND
ALL THESE OTHER "MEDIA
ORGANIZATIONS" IS THAT HE'S A
VICTIM HERE, SO THEY LOVE THE
TWEETS, THEY THINK HE'S TELLING
IT LIKE IT IS AND CALLING PEOPLE
OUT AND BEING A TOUGH GUY.
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THE
REALITY OF WHAT'S GOING ON
BEHIND THE SCENES.
>>HE SAID DRAIN THE SWAMP, FIGHT
THE ESTABLISHMENT, A LOT OF HIS
FOLLOWERS THINK HE'S PUTTING THE
ESTABLISHMENT WHERE THEY NEED TO
BE, BUT HERE IS SCOOTER LIBBY,
PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, PART
OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HE
CRITICIZED, HE SAYS I WAS
AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR, EVEN
THOUGH HE SAID ON HOWARD STERN
HE WAS FOR IT, NOW HE HAS
PARDONED A GUY WHO WAS INVOLVED
WITH OUTING SOMEONE BECAUSE OF
THEIR OPPOSITION 
TO 
THE IRAQ
WAR.
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
