1
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:11,544
YOU WILL.

2
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,380
>> I'M NOT PRO-RUSSIA,

3
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:13,780
PRO-ANYBODY.

4
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:14,781
I JUST WANT THIS COUNTRY TO

5
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:15,749
BE SAFE.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,816
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE HAVING

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,118
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,452
RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,654
CONTROL 90% OF THE NUCLEAR

10
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:22,555
WEAPONS IN THE WORLD.

11
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,690
AND GETTING ALONG WITH

12
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,425
RUSSIA AND NOT ONLY FOR THAT

13
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,393
REASON, THAT'S A GOOD THING,

14
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,596
NOT A BAD THING.

15
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,230
BRIAN: THE PRESIDENT SAYS

16
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,164
THAT BEFORE AND HE SAID IT

17
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,465
IN THE PAST AND HE SAID IT

18
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,140
AINSLEY: RIGHT AFTER THE

19
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:40,840
PRESS CONFERENCE, TUCKER GOT

20
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,745
AND ONE LAST NIGHT.

21
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,549
ASSUME WHERE SHE LIVES.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,283
GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS

23
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:50,617
MORNING.

24
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,619
THANKS FOR WAKING UP SUPER

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:52,919
EARLY.

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,787
>> OF COURSE.

27
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:54,721
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:55,288
AINSLEY: THANK YOU.

29
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,162
WAY THE MEDIA TREATED HIM?

30
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,363
>> THERE WERE MANY ON THE

31
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,898
LEFT AND OF COURSE SOME OF

32
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:05,832
OUR FAVORITE NEVER TRUMPERS

33
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,736
EVEN BEGAN BECAUSE THEY WILL

34
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,870
USE ANY EXCUSE TO BE

35
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,209
WHICH WAS TRY TO REPAIR

36
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,277
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.

37
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,883
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING

38
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:24,918
ON FOR FAR TOO LONG AND

39
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:25,652
THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE

40
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:26,286
OF COLLUSION.

41
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,654
THIS PRESIDENT IS HE

42
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,122
THIS PRESIDENT IS FED UP AS

43
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,190
ARE MOST OF THE AMERICAN

44
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:30,523
PEOPLE.

45
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,357
IF THERE IS EVIDENCE OF

46
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,161
STOP WASTING OUR TIME

47
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,229
BECAUSE THE CANDIDATES, OR

48
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,297
THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO WIN,

49
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,232
DID NOT WIN IN 2016.

50
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,268
I'M FED UP.

51
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,169
I'M SURE EVERYONE WATCH

52
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,204
SOMETHING FED UP WITH THIS

53
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,706
AT THIS POINT.

54
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,474
STEVE: TOMI, THE RHETORIC

55
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,408
FROM THE LEFT REGARDING WHAT

56
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,477
HE SAID AND HE SAID HE

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,277
MISSPOKE YESTERDAY WHEN HE

58
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,981
CLARIFIED YESTERDAY IN THE

59
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:55,448
ROOSEVELT ROOM.

60
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,451
THE RHETORIC FROM THE LEFT

61
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,352
HAS BEEN HYPERBOLIC.

62
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,420
WHAT HE SAID WAS WORSE THAN

63
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,555
9/11, WORSE THAT CRYSTAL

64
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:02,922
KNOCK.

65
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,991
PEARL HARBOR HE IS A TRAITOR

66
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,360
AND TREASONOUS.

67
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,531
SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS LIKE

68
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,198
THAT ON THE LEFT.

69
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,933
>> OH, THESE ARE THE FINAL

70
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,568
STAGES OF TRUMP DERANGEMENT

71
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,603
SYNDROME AND YOU WILL SEE IT

72
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,937
MORE AND MORE AS WE HEAD

73
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,739
INTO MID TERMS.

74
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,749
WAGE WAR AGAINST RUSSIA

75
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,450
BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON LOST

76
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:30,884
THE ELECTION?

77
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,118
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION.

78
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,387
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SELECTIVE

79
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,755
OUTRAGE FROM THE LEFT, IT

80
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,856
WOULD ALMOST SEEM AS IF THAT

81
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:37,757
IS WHAT THEY WANT.

82
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,397
TOWARDS DIPLOMACY AND WORLD

83
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,498
PEACE OR WOULD YOU LIKE HIM

84
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,100
TO BE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS

85
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:47,667
RUSSIA BECAUSE HILLARY

86
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,668
CLINTON LOST THE ELECTION?

87
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,403
VERY SIMPLE.

88
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:50,837
BRIAN: RIGHT.

89
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,471
LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE

90
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:51,805
RESULTS.

91
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,106
THE TAX CUT WAS ONLY FOR THE

92
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:53,940
RICH, REALLY?

93
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,574
LOOK AT THE ECONOMY.

94
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,642
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT

95
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,143
NORTH KOREA, WELL, IT WAS

96
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,244
ALL FALLING APART.

97
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,345
TALKS AREN'T GOING WELL.

98
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,680
YESTERDAY, WE GOT THE

99
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,116
REMAINS, I UNDERSTANDING, OF

100
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,117
50 NORTH KOREAN WAR

101
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:04,484
VETERANS.

102
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,685
SO THAT IS ON TRACK.

103
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,688
NOW WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING

104
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,889
THAT IF THE RUSSIA DEAL

105
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,924
COMES FORWARD, WE'RE GOING

106
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,792
TO HAVE A SERIES OF

107
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,526
CONSISTENT MEETINGS WITH

108
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,795
HIGHER UPS IN RUSSIA FOR THE

109
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,896
MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IN

110
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:17,931
THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

111
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,999
THE RESULTS AND THE ANGER

112
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,303
THE RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT.

113
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,737
AND THEY ARE TURNING OUT THE

114
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,841
WAY THE PRESIDENT SAYS.

115
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:28,842
>> DO YOU THINK THE

116
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:29,676
DEMOCRATS WANT THIS

117
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,544
PRESIDENT TO HAVE ANY

118
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,478
VICTORIES?

119
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,416
INTO THIS PRESIDENCY.

120
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,917
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT YOU

121
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,152
MENTIONED, ALL

122
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,186
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, IT ALMOST

123
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,397
>> THERE IS A 28-YEAR-OLD

124
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:51,931
POLITICAL NEWCOMER.

125
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:52,832
SHE IS A SOCIALIST.

126
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,601
WHO WON THE DEMOCRATIC

127
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:01,140
HER NAME ALEXANDER OCASIO

128
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:01,474
CORTEZ.

129
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,542
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE REALLY

130
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,777
HAS A HANDLE ON HOW THE JOBS

131
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,211
THING WORKS.

132
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,446
BUT SHE HAD THIS OBSERVATION

133
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,618
>> UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW

134
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,786
BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS TWO

135
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:14,454
JOBS.

136
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,755
UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE

137
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,729
BARELY FEED THEIR KIDS.

138
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,164
AND SO I DO THINK RIGHT NOW

139
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,601
WE HAVE THIS NO HOLDS BARRED

140
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,973
ANY COST.

141
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,208
CAPITALISM HAS NOT ALWAYS

142
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,175
EXISTED IN THE WORLD.

143
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,515
SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HER

144
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,683
ECONOMICS IDEA WHERE

145
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,450
EVERYBODY, THE REASON

146
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,718
UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE

147
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,188
EVERYBODY HAS GOT TWO JOBS?

148
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,323
>> ISN'T IT DISTURBING THAT

149
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,758
THE, QUOTE, FUTURE OF THE

150
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,358
DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOESN'T

151
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,793
KNOW HOW THE UNEMPLOYMENT

152
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,263
BE A BETTER FACE FOR THE

153
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,665
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAN

154
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,867
HILLARY CLINTON BUT THEN

155
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,368
ALEXANDER OCASIO CORTEZ CAME

156
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:02,669
ALONG.

157
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,836
I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S

158
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:04,871
DISTURBING BUT LIKE I TOLD

159
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,506
YOU GUY AS COUPLE WEEKS AGO,

160
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,907
IF THIS IS TRULY THE NEW

161
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:08,975
FACE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

162
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,210
I REALLY LIKE OUR CHANCES IN

163
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:11,644
NOVEMBER.

164
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,779
BRIAN: A COUPLE OF THINGS,

165
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,150
LIKE WHEN TALENTED PEOPLE

166
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,718
LIKE YOU AND HER SHE HAS

167
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,119
TALENT GET INTO POLITICS.

168
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,957
I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN

169
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,663
IN FACT JOE LIEBERMAN CAME

170
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,231
OUT YESTERDAY AND SAID JOE

171
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,166
CROWLEY SHOULD DO WHAT I

172
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:33,433
DID.

173
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,801
WHEN I LOST MY PRIMARY I

174
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,205
SEAT JOE CROWLEY SHOULD GO

175
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,441
TRY DO THAT DO YOU THINK HE

176
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,575
SHOULD GO TRY TO DO THAT?

177
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,277
>> FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR

178
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,278
COUNTRY I WOULD HOPE THAT

179
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,945
REASONABLE DEMOCRATS ARE

180
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,581
COMING FORWARD AND

181
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,118
CHALLENGING SOMEONE LIKE

182
00:05:52,119 --> 00:06:01,194
LEANED

183
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:01,227
ALANED

184
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:01,260
ALEXED

185
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,463
ALEXANDER CORTEZ.

186
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:04,564
A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

187
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,498
LOOKING AT HER AS THE FUTURE

188
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,199
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

189
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,534
I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

190
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,535
DESERVES BETTER.

191
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,473
AND WE DON'T NEED LEADERS

192
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,741
LIKE HER PREACHING THE VALUE

193
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,443
