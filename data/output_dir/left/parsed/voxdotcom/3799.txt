on Tuesday Syrian dictator Bashar
al-assad launched a horrible chemical
weapons attack on innocent civilians
using a deadly nerve agent tonight I
ordered a targeted military statement on
the airfield in Syria from where a
chemical attack was launched it is in
this vital national security interest of
the United States to prevent and deter
to spread and use of deadly chemical
weapons
