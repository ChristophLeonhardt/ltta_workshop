00:00:00,493 --> 00:00:02,629
DON'T WANT THINGS TO

00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,062
OVERHEAT.

3
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:05,198

11
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:16,442

TO RANK CANDIDATES IN ORDER

15
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:21,014

16
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:21,915
JUST CHOOSING ONE.

17
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:23,483

00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:46,339

THIS POLL OUT TODAY FROM

38
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:49,609
SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY IN THE

39
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:50,743
OHIO SENATE RACE WITH

40
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,245

A HOUSE MEMBER RIGHT NOW

44
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:59,552
ONLY AT 36.6%.

45
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:01,220
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

46
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,623
RENACCI HAD TOLD MITCH

47
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,559
MCCONNELL AND OHIO COULD BE

48
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,760
AN ACTUAL REPUBLICAN PICKUP.

49
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,594
HOW IS THAT LOOKING RIGHT

50
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:08,861
NOW.

51
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,496
>> LOOK, IT'S A COMPETITIVE

52
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:10,797
STATE.

53
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:11,898
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A

54
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:12,799
COMPETITIVE STATE.

55
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,467
WE ARE AT THE STAGE OF THE

56
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:15,401
SENATE RACE IN OHIO.

57
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:17,737
JUST THROUGH THE PRIMARIES,

58
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,405
GOT TON PINT WHERE THAT

59
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,040
ELECTORATE HASN'T REDEFINED

60
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,374
ITSELF.

61
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:22,608
I THINK WHEN YOU SEE TRUMP

62
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:23,776
VOTERS COME HOME AND SUPPORT

63
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:24,610
THE REPUBLICAN TICKET,

64
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,012
THAT'S GOING TO TIGHTEN UP

65
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:27,146
PRETTY CONSIDERABLY WHERE

66
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:30,883
IT'S CURRENTLY AT.

67
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:31,517
>> Dana: ADRIENNE WHEN YOU

68
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:32,852
LOOK AT PRIMARY RESULTS

69
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:34,320
KATIE ARRINGTON WINNING

70
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,855
AGAINST MARK SANFORD IN THAT

71
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:36,189
PRIMARY.

72
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:40,860
BECAUSE SHE SAID HE WAS NOT

73
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,427
SUPPORTIVE ENOUGH OF

74
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:42,028
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

75
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,262
LISTEN TO SENATOR BOB CORKER

76
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:44,397
ON WHAT HE SAID ABOUT

77
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,098
REPUBLICAN SENATORS BEING

78
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:45,865
KIND OF SCARED OF THE

79
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:46,332
PRESIDENT.

80
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:48,668
>> THE UNITED STATES SENATE

81
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:51,170
RIGHT NOW ON JUNE THE 12TH

82
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,273
IS BECOMING A BODY WHERE WE

83
00:01:54,273 --> 00:02:03,449
WILL DO WHEN WE CAN DO.

84
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,218
NOT DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT

85
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:06,652
UPSET THE PRESIDENT.

86
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:07,854
>> Dana: I FEEL THIS IS

87
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,122
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IF YOU GO

88
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,656
BACK TO 2010 AND THINKING

89
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,691
ABOUT DEMOCRATS WHO WERE

90
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:12,992
WEARY OF, YOU KNOW,

91
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:14,293
UPSETTING THE POPULAR

92
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:15,461
PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME,

93
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:16,496
BARACK OBAMA.

94
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:17,196
>> YEAH.

95
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:18,197
WELL, I THINK WHAT YOU ARE

96
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:19,265
ALSO SEEING HERE IS THAT

97
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,067
THERE IS SIMPLY NOT ROOM FOR

98
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:21,801
MODERATE REPUBLICANS IN THE

99
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:22,301
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

100
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:24,137
I MEAN, LOOK AT MARK SANFORD

101
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:24,937
LAST NIGHT IN SOUTH

102
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:25,304
CAROLINA.

103
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:26,873
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN -- WHO

104
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:28,474
HAS GOVERNED MODERATELY BUT

105
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:29,375
ALSO SPOKEN OUT AGAINST

106
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,476
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

107
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:31,911
YOU ARE SEEING MORE MODERATE

108
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:34,113
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LOSING

109
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,082
THEIR PRIMARIES TO VERY

110
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:37,150
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS WHO

111
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,084
TRUMP ENDORSES.

112
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:39,218
NOT ALWAYS HAPPENING BUT

113
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:40,086
BEEN HAPPENING QUITE A BIT.

114
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:41,054
I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

115
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:42,822
HAS A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING

116
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:43,956
TO DECIDE ARE WE GOING TO BE

117
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,558
THE PARTY OF TRUMP OR ARE WE

118
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:48,227
GOING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO

119
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:49,695
GOVERN MODERATELY AND

120
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:50,963
REPRESENT MODERATE

121
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:51,431
REPUBLICANS.

122
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,031
>> Dana: JOSH, YOU THINK

123
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:53,466
THIS IS A NO-BRAINER, THE

124
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,434
PRESIDENT IS SUPER POPULAR

125
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:55,334
WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

126
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:57,003
AND SO THIS IS THE WAY IT'S

127
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:58,004
GOING TO BE.

128
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:00,039
WOULD YOU SAY MODERATE

129
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,241
DEMOCRATS ARE ENDANGERED

130
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:02,742
SPECIES AS WELL.

131
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:07,046
>> MORNING SANFORD IS NO

132
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:07,814
MODERATE.

133
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:08,414
EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE

134
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:08,948
GOVERNOR FROM SOUTH

135
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:09,315
CAROLINA.

136
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:09,916
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS

137
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:10,750
VOTERS DON'T HAVE ANY

138
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,418
PATIENCE FOR THOSE WHO MAKE

139
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,920
ANTI-TRUMP SORT OF THEIR

140
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,287
IDENTITY.

141
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,521
THEY WANT REPUBLICANS TO

142
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,191
PICK UP THEIR LUNCH PAIL AND

143
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,492
GO TO WORK AND TRY TO GET

144
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:20,393
THIS AGENDA DONE.

145
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,328
OF COURSE, SANFORD SPENT

146
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,863
INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME

147
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:24,964
CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT.

148
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:25,631
I DON'T THINK VOTERS HAVE

149
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,299
ANY PATIENCE FOR THAT AT

150
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,768
THIS POINT.

151
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:29,402
>> Dana: ADRIENNE, LET ME

152
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:30,436
ALSO ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT

153
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:31,037
SOMETHING DEMOCRATS ARE

154
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,004
PROUD OF.

155
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,106
THEY HAVE SOME NUMBERS THEY

156
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:33,806
CAN POINT TO.

157
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:34,874
NUMBER OF WOMEN CANDIDATES

158
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,442
WHO ARE RUNNING FOR THE --

159
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:38,344
AS A PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC

160
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,912
PARTY, THEY ARE WINNING BIG

161
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:40,446
TIME.

162
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:42,348
COOK POLITICAL REPORTS DAVID

163
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,349
WASSERMAN TWEET YOU HAD,

164
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,050
THIS REMARKABLE.

165
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,451
AFTER TONIGHT, DEMS HAVE

166
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:48,254
NOMINATED WOMEN IN 73 OUT OF

167
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:50,656
150, THAT'S 49% OF HOUSE

168
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,260
RACES, EXCLUDING DEM

169
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,395
INCUMBENTS ON THE REPUBLICAN

170
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:58,498
SIDE.

171
00:03:58,498 --> 00:03:58,865
16%.

172
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,234
18 OUT OF 112.

173
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:02,168
DO YOU THINK THOSE WOMEN

174
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:03,236
WILL ULTIMATELY WIN IN THE

175
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:04,437
GENERAL ELECTION AS WELL?

176
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:05,771
>> YEAH, I DO, DANA.

177
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,606
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME

178
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:08,441
TALK ABOUT MY VERY FAVORITE

179
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,475
TOPIC TO TALK ABOUT WHICH

180
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,144
SAUL THE WOMEN WHO ARE

181
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:12,578
WINNING AT RECORD AMOUNTS IN

182
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:13,713
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

183
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,014
IF A WOMAN IS RUNNING

184
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,149
AGAINST A MAN OR SEVERAL MEN

185
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,617
IN A PRIMARY ON THE

186
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:18,885
DEMOCRATIC PARTY SIDE, THE

187
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,386
CHANCES OF HER WINNING ARE

188
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,422
SOMETHING I THINK AROUND

189
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,524
90%, 92% AT THIS STAGE OF

190
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:25,591
THE CYCLE.

191
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:26,692
EMILY'S LIST, FOR EXAMPLE,

192
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:27,627
ONE EVER THE PRIMARY

193
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:29,262
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELPS

194

HIGHER OFFICE, 36,000 WOMEN

196
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,833
HAVE CONTACTED EMILY'S LIST

197
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,268
THIS CYCLE WITH INTEREST IN

198
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:37,103
RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

199
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,605
SOMETHING LIKE 950 IN 2016.

200
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:40,907
SO IT JUST SHOWS THAT WOMEN

201
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:41,507
ARE FIRED UP.

202
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,543
THEY WANT TO TAKE BACK THEIR

203
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:43,876
COUNTRY.

204
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:45,178
THEY REALIZE THE ONLY WAY WE

205
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:46,379
CAN REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT IS

206
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,146
TO GET INVOLVED.

207
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:48,748
A LOT OF THEM ARE GETTING

208
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:49,782
INVOLVED BY RUNNING FOR

209
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:51,450
CONGRESS OR RUNNING FOR ANY

210
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:51,918
OFFICE.

211
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,853
IT'S REALLY MAKING A HUGE

212
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:54,320
DIFFERENCE.

213
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,854
>> Dana: JOSH, THE

214
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,255
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS -- I

HAD STEVE STIVERS ON, HE IS

216
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,358
THE NRCC CHAIRMAN THIS YEAR.

217
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:00,593
THEY DO HAVE BETTER NUMBERS

218
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,627
THAN THEY HAVE HAD IN THE

219
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:01,928
PAST.

220
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:02,962
YOUR THOUGHTS?

221
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:05,264
>> WELL, LOOK, CAN I NAME

222
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,132
TWO MORE WOMEN CANDIDATES

223
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:09,402
THAT ARE GOING TO BE WINNING

224
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:10,937
ARIZONA WITH MARTHA

225
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,104
MCSALLY A GREAT CANDIDATE

226
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:12,939
FOR SENATE DOWN THERE.

227
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:13,940
SHE IS DEFINITELY GOING TO

228
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,875

229
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:16,242
TENNESSEE.

230
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,376
I AGREE WITH ADRIENNE IT'S

231
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,711
GOING TO BE A GREAT YEAR FOR

232
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:19,011
WOMEN.

233
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,179
NOT JUST A GREAT YEAR FOR

234
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:20,813
LIBERAL WOMEN.

235
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:21,781
IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT

236
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:22,949
YEAR FOR WOMEN ACROSS THE

237
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:23,649
BOARD AND I THINK

238
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:24,383
REPUBLICANS ARE EXCITED

239
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:25,818
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

240
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:26,485
>> Dana: LET ME ASK YOU ONE

241
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:26,919
LAST QUESTION.

242
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,187
I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE

243
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:28,487
EACH.

244
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:29,655
PAUL RYAN ANNOUNCED THAT

245
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:30,990
NEXT WEEK THERE IS GOING TO

246
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,559
BE VOTES ON TWO IMMIGRATION

247
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:33,859
BILLS.

248
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:35,127
DEALING WITH DACA, THE

249
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,429
DREAMERS, AND BORDER

250
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:37,496
SECURITY.

251
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:40,466
AND THIS IS AS MCCLATCHEY IS

252
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,100
REPORTING THAT PRESIDENT

253
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,303
TRUMP IS LOOK TO ERECT TENT

254
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,805
CITY TO HOUSE UNACCOMPANIED

255
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:46,839
CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM

256
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,207
THEIR PARENTS AS THEY

257
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:49,542
ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE BORDER

258
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,009
ILLEGALLY.

259
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:50,776
JOSH, I BRING THAT UP

260
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:51,911
BECAUSE I DO THINK BECAUSE

261
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,179
THAT ISSUE IS GETTING A LOT

262
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:54,847
OF ATTENTION, PEOPLE FEEL

263
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,015
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT IT AND

264
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,283
POINTS ON BOTH SIDES.

265
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:58,884
IS THAT GOING TO FUEL A LOT

266
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,119
MORE INTEREST IN THESE

267
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,120
IMMIGRATION BILLS NEXT WEEK?

268
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,888
>> WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE.

269
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,523
SO AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK

270
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:05,591
WHAT SPEAKER RYAN IS TRYING

271
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,293
TO DO IS GET TO AN OUTCOME

272
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,629
HERE AND WHAT WE SEE TOO

273
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:11,998
MUCH OF LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

274
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:12,965
IS PARTICULARLY ON THE

275
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:13,633
DEMOCRATIC SIDE THEY WANT

276
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:14,200
THE ISSUE.

277
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,701
THEY DON'T WANT IT RESOLVED.

278
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:16,502
AND, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

279
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,937
CAME OUT AND MADE SOME

280
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,372
ACCOMMODATIONS TO SAY, YOU

281
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:20,406
KNOW, WE WILL GO AHEAD AND

282
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:21,907
DO DACA IF WE CAN ALSO BUILD

283
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:23,643
THE WALL, HAVE SOME BORDER

284
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:25,811
SECURITY AND DO SOME MODEST

285
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:27,747
REFRAMING OF THE -- OF CHAIN

286
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:28,581
MIGRATION, DEMOCRATS SAID

287
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:28,848
NO.

288
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,082
AND SO, YOU KNOW, MY HOPE IS

289
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:31,517
THAT WE CAN GET BEYOND THAT

290
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,653
SORT OF PARTISAN CORNERS

291
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:34,654
OUTLOOK OF THIS AND ACTUALLY

292
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:37,189
GET TO A SOLUTION HERE.

293
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,823
>> Dana: ADRIENNE, DO YOU

294
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,457
THINK NEXT WEEK IF THE

295
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:39,058
LEGISLATION LOOKS LIKE

296
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:39,925
SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP

297
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:41,260
SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT MAYBE

298
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,528
TAKE AWAY THE POLITICAL TOOL

299
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,329
THAT THE DEMOCRATS WOULD

300
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,664
WANT TO USE IN THE FALL THAT

301
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:45,765
THAT WOULD BE WORTH IT?

302
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,300
>> LOOK, I'M GOING TO

303
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,200
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH

304
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,135
MY FRIEND JOSH HERE.

305
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,303
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IT VERY

306
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:51,103
CLEAR FROM THE VERY

307
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,605
BEGINNING OF THIS DEBATE

308
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,273
THAT WE WILL COME TO THE

309
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:54,573
TABLE.

310
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:55,541
WE WILL NEGOTIATE ON THIS.

311
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,575
YOU ACTUALLY JUST SAID,

312
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:59,211
JOSH, THAT WE WOULD ALLOW

313
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,379
FOR BORDER SECURITY FUNDING.

314
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,580
SOME SORT OF FUNDING FOR THE

315
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,548
WALL IN ORDER TO CREATE A

316
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,317
PATH OF CITIZENSHIP FOR

317
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:04,684
DREAMERS.

318
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:06,852
SO, YOU KNOW, THE REAL LOSER

319
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:07,687
HERE ARE THE DREAMERS.

320
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,488
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN

321
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:10,589
LIMBO IN THIS COUNTRY WHO

322
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:11,524
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING

323
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:13,426
TO BE DEPORTED OR NOT.

324
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,260
I DO HOPE DEMOCRATS AND

325
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,860
REPUBLICANS CAN COME

326
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,095
TOGETHER AND FIND A

327
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:16,462
SOLUTION.

328
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:17,730
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR

329
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,731
ALL ALONG WE'RE WILLING TO

330
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:19,398
PLAY BALL.

331
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,299
WE WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION

332
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,100
TO THIS ISSUE.

333
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,769
>> LET'S NOT FORGET

334
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:24,603
DEMOCRATS SHUT DOWN THE

335
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,738
GOVERNMENT OVER THIS ISSUE

336
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:26,872
IN FEBRUARY.

337
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:27,540
>> Dana: THAT'S TRUE.

338
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,308
>> GET A COMPROMISE.

339
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:30,042
>> Dana: CHANCE TO VOTE ON

340
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,577

341
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,012
WE YOU HAVE COME BACK, JOSH,

342
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,180
