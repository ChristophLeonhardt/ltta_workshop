IT WAS SO GLORIOUS, JOHN.
WHAT A WONDERFUL MAN HE WAS.
>> ALL RIGHT.
JUAN WILLIAMS FOR US IN NEW
YORK.
JUAN, THANKS FOR BEING WITH
US.
RIGHT NOW LET'S TALK WITH
THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
MITCH MCCONNELL WHO IS ON
THE PHONE WITH US.
SENATOR SUCH A SAD OCCASION
TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT
BUT YOUR MEMORIES OF CHARLES
KRAUTHAMMER.
>> LIKE EVERYBODY SAID HE
WAS IN A CLASS OF HIMSELF.
MY FIRST MEMORY US IS
TALKING ABOUT THE WASHINGTON
NATIONALS.
WE FOUND OURSELVES IN ON
FREQUENT AGREEMENT ON
ISSUES.
HE WAS, OF COURSE.
>> REALLY THE INTELLECTUAL
RIGHT OF CENTER WHO DEFINED
WHAT WE DID RIGHT OF CENTER
WORLD BOTH IN CONGRESS AND
OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
EVERY TIME WE TALKED, WHICH
WAS QUITE OFTEN.
WE STARTED WITH THE
WASHINGTON NATIONALITIES.
HE LOVED THEM.
KNEW A LOT ABOUT THEM U
TALKING BASEBALL IS WHAT WE
ENJOYED THE MOST.
I ACTUALLY MET HIM THROUGH
MY FRIEND GEORGE WILL WHO,
OF COURSE, IS THE BASEBALL
EXPERT OF ALL TIMES CHARLES
WAS A CLOSE SECOND.
>> SENATOR MCCONNELL, IN
THESE DAYS WHEN THE
POLITICAL DISCOURSE TO A
LARGE DEGREE REALLY HAS
POLARITY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS
INCREASED TO A DEGREE WHERE
IT HAS REALLY SEEN A LOT OF
ANGER IN TERMS OF PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, TALKING ACROSS THE
AISLE OR THE FENCE AT EACH
OTHER.
CHARLES WAS A CONSERVATIVE
COMMUNE TERRITORY AND
COMMENE TERRITORY AND
COMMENTATERRITORY AND
COMMENTATORRITORY AND
COMMENTATOR ATORY AND
COMMENTATOR ANDRY AND
COMMENTATOR AND C AND
COMMENTATOR AND COLND
COMMENTATOR AND COLUMNIST
HAD THE ABILITY TO CROSS
OVER BOTH SIDES EVEN IF YOU
DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM YOU
RESPECTED HIS OPINION.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HIM THAT
ALLOWED HIM THAT?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, HIS
INTELLECT WOWED YOU.
I THINK ANYBODY WHO WAS
AROUND CHARLES KNEW IT WAS
NOT A GOOD IDEA TO BE
SCREAMING BECAUSE HE WAS
GOING TO HANDLE HIMSELF IN A
CLASSY WAY RESPECTFUL
DISCOURSE.
IT WAS A GOOD OBJECT LESSON
FOR ALL OF US IN POLITICS
WHO HAVE A TENDENCY FROM
TIME TO TIME TO RAISE OUR
VOICES.
>> WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM THAT
YOU WILL REMEMBER THE MOST?
WHAT WILL YOU HOLD WITH YOU
ABOUT CHARLES?
>> WELL, OVERCOMING SUCH
ADVERSITY AND LEADING SUCH A
CONSEQUENTIAL LIFE IS AN
INSPIRATION TO ALL OF US.
I MEAN, MOST OF US HAVE SET
BACKS OF ONE KIND OR
ANOTHER.
BUT NOTHING COMING CLOSE TO
APPROACHING WHAT HE HAD TO
DEAL WITH THROUGHOUT HIS
LIFE.
AND TO BECOME REALLY THE
INTELLECTUAL LEADER OF
THOUGHT RIGHT OF CENTER FOR
ALL THESE YEARS IS
ASTONISHING ACCOMPLISHMENT.
>> IT CERTAINLY IS HE WILL
BE REMEMBERED BY ALL OF US
FOR BEING ABLE TO OVERCOME
SUCH ADVERSITY AND TO
MAINTAIN SUCH A GOOD SENSE
OF HUMOR AS WELL.
THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT
BOTH BRIT HUME AND BRET
BAIER TALKED ABOUT.
DO YOU RECALL HIS SENSE OF
HUMOR?
>> OH, HE WAS FUN.
NOTHING BETTER THAN A
CONVERSATION WITH CHARLES
KRAUTHAMMER.
HE KNEW SO MUCH MORE THAN
THE REST OF US.
YOUR FIRST REACTION I'M
AFRAID I'M GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING STUPID.
EVEN IF YOU HAD, HE WOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT
HE WAS A LOVELY MAN IN EVERY
SINGLE MEASURABLE WAY.
WHAT A LIFE OF CONSEQUENCE.
>> SENATOR MCCONNELL, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO
