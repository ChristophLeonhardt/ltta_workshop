Martha: THE POLLS ARE CLOSING SOON AND SOME OF THE KEY PRIMARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL E WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL S WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL O WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL N WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL S WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL V WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL R WE ARE KEEPING SEVERAL L CRITICAL RACES TONIGHT. IN CALIFORNIA'S 48TH DISTRICT WHICH IS A PRETTY CROWDED FIELD, MANY OF THEM ARE, DEMOCRATS ARE VYING FOR REPUBLICAN DANA ROHRABACHER'S SEAT. ONE OF THOSE CANDIDATES, OMAR SIDDIQUI, WAS TOLD BY PARTY OFFICIALS THAT HE WAS QUOTE TO BROWN TO WIN THERE. HERE IS OMAR SIDDIQUI, ALSO FBI DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL PROJECTS AND FORMER ADVISOR ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE HAD SOME CALIFORNIA DELEGATES COME UP TO ME AND SAY, YOU ARE BY FAR THE BEST CANDIDATE, YOU ARE AN ENGINEER, AND THE NAME OMAR SIDDIQUI WILL NOT WORK IN ORANGE COUNTY. YOU NEED TO CHANGE HER NAME. THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE, THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME. AND, DID YOU CALL THESE PEOPLE OUT BY NAME? WHAT I DID WAS, I TOLD THEM POINT BLANK. I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY NAME, AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WITH THIS NAME WILL NOT HAVE A CHANCE. AND I MOVE FORWARD AND WE HAD A EXCELLENT CLEAN CAMPAIGN AND WE DID VERY WELL. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE RESULTS THAT COME OUT TONIGHT. Martha: I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIVISION IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU LIKE TO BE SOMEONE THAT HEALS THOSE DIVISIONS. DO YOU THINK THAT WAS PART OF YOUR MESSAGE PROBLEM AS FAR AS YOUR MESSAGE PROBLEM AS FAR AS THAT POWER IS CONCERNED IN YOUR DISTRICT? I LOVE THAT. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PARTY OF THE UNDERREPRESENTED AND THE PARTY OF THE MARGINALIZED. DURING THE COURSE FOR OUR CAMPAIGN WE KNOCKED ON THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOORS AND ONE THING WAS A RECURRING THEME, THE UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES WERE NOT GETTING ANY ATTENTION, POINT BLANK. SO PARTY DOWN LIKE TO HAVE PARTY UNITY YOU NEED TO REACH OUT TO THE HONOR MARGINALIZED. YOU NEED WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD ALL RACES AND ALL CULTURES, THEY ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CONSTITUENCY HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY. Martha: YOU BASICALLY HAVE A CIVIL WAR OF SORTS GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE THEM ARE DUMB LIKE MORE RURAL AREAS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNANCE, THEN YOU HAVE THE VERY DUG IN, BLUE AREAS THAT HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH HIGH TAXES AND PEOPLE FLEEING THE STATE. HOW WOULD YOU WORK TO PULL IT BACK TOGETHER? I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT REPRESENTATION BACK INTO YOUR REPRESENTATIVE. I THINK CONGRESSMAN ROHRABACHER HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM THE DISTRICT. THE ONLY TIME HE SHOWS UP IS TO COME TO CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS TO A SPREAD HATE AND DIVIDE THE COUNTY AND THAT'S THE WRONG MESSAGE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT ISSUES THAT AFFECT EVERYONE AND EVERYWHERE. HOMELESSNESS, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT FROM HIM BUT WE WILL SEE THAT FROM OUR CAMPAIGN FOR SURE. Martha: I THINK IT'S SHOCKING THAT SOME OF THE PARTY OFFICIALS TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE QUOTE TO BROWN TO WIN. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU HAVE A LOT OF VERY
