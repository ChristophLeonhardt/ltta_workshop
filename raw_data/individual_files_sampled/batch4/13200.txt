people do this with the country too instead of talking about what the country is for they talk about all the things that have happened that they don't like so for instance the other day Spike Lee the filmmaker right he said the United States of America was built on the genocide of Native people and slavery that is the fabric of the United States of America first of all I'm looking at the guy look on it the anger on his face is crushed little face of anger I thought whatever he's having give me something else you know I mean that that is not you know you know George George Orwell said at 50 everyone has the face he deserves if you're Spike Lee and you're a multi-millionaire filmmaker is that a successful career and you're living in America your face looks like this change your philosophy because that's not a good way to end up but I'm thinking about that I'm thinking fact fact well those are facts to some degree those are facts there there's some facts in there but facts can be manipulated right I mean what spike is talking about is basically this idea of America that is sold in one of the most popular history textbooks around the people's history of the United States by Howard Zinn and howerton says it the biginning book at least he's open about it he that he wants to tell the history of the United States according to its victims so he wants to tell the discovery of America according to the Native Americans who were there he says I want to tell the story of the Constitution from the point of view of the slaves that's but facts can be manipulated right Howard Zinn for instance was a Marxist he was a socialist an idea that has been associated with over a hundred million murders every one of them of somebody who was just as real to himself as you are to you right every one of them who was killed was just as real as you and Howard Zinn says well you know socialism was a great idea until the Soviet Union gave it a bad name and I think all right well maybe the Constitution is a great idea and slavery gave it a bad name you know maybe the way you treat facts on one side should be the way you treat it on another think of it like this think about your own life what if I told the story of your life and I said here's this this fellow here the story of his life let me begin porn searches you know and then we're gonna then we're gonna talk about the time he was nasty to his mother the time he was lied to his girlfriend and you know that that's what I'm going to talk about I'm never gonna talk what would any of us I didn't you know this guy that it all of us all of us I could do that to any of us wears it but he said you know who is Martin Luther King well Martin Luther King was a guy cheated on his wife fact fact you know what if I said that who's Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson was guy who owned slaves fact fact right but people cities countries civilizations are not just about the things that happen those things shouldn't be hidden away they should be talked about they should be known but they're not just about the things that happen they're about the things they stand for the things they fight for the things they live for and die for and the changes they make in the world whether they're for good or ill
