this week on the business of life we
travel to Boston to question the value
of education the average college
graduate is saddled with thousands of
dollars of death that's because the
average cost of a four-year education in
this country has exploded over the last
two decades but the data consistently
shows that those are the bachelor's
degree out earn those with high school
degrees so what is the value of
education everything you need to know
about higher education broken down
through facts and figures by the
smartest people in the room the US
Department of Education makes fifty
billion dollars in profit off of our
student loans more than Exxon Mobil the
most profitable company in United States
makes this is the business of life
