PRUITT BRIEFING THIS AFTERNOON.
TRACE GALLAGHER HAS THE STORY
FROM OUR WEST COAST NEWSROOM.
TRACE?
>> THIS IS THE EPA'S NATIONAL
SUMMIT ON HARMFUL WATER
CONTAMINANTS LINKED TO WATER.
JOURNALISTS FROM CNN, ASSOCIATED
PRESS, WERE NOT ALLOWED INSIDE.
A.P. SAYS ITS REPORTER WAS NOT
ONLY DENIED ENTRY, BUT GRABBED
BY SECURITY AND FORCIBLY SHOVED
OUT OF THE BUILDING.
THE EPA DIDN'T COMMENT ABOUT
ANYONE PHYSICALLY REMOVING A
JOURNALIST, BUT SAID THE PLAN
WAS TO ALLOW 10 REPORTERS
INSIDE, SAYING, QUOTING, THIS
WAS SIMPLY AN ISSUE OF THE ROOM
REACHING CAPACITY, WHICH
REPORTERS WERE AWARE OF PRIOR TO
THE EVENT.
A REPORT BY THE HILL SAID THAT
DURING THE CONFERENCE, A HANDFUL
OF SEATS REMAINED VACANT.
ANOTHER REPORTER TOLD POLITICO
THERE WERE DOZENS OF EMPTY
SEATS, AND CNN ALSO SHOWED
PICTURES OF SPACE FOR CAMERAS.
FOR THE RECORD, FOX NEWS WAS NOT
THERE.
INSTEAD WE DECIDED TO USE THE
POOL CAMERA, WHICH WAS PROVIDED
BY CBS.
BUT ALL THREE ORGANIZATIONS NOT
ALLOWED IN, LATER RELEASED
STATEMENTS.
CNN SAID, QUOTING, WE UNDERSTAND
THE IMPORTANCE OF AN OPEN AND
FREE PRESS, AND WE HOPE THE EPA
DOES TOO.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS CALLED IT,
QUOTE, ALARMING AND A DIRECT
THREAT TO THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO
KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE THEIR
GOVERNMENT.
ANOTHER SAID THE TOPIC WAS
CRITICAL TO THEIR READERS, AND
OUR REPORTER DESERVED TO BE IN
THAT ROOM TO ASK SMART QUESTIONS
OF EPA OFFICIALS.
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY
SARAH SANDERS FIRST SAID SHE
WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER, AND
THEN EVER ASKED IF IT'S
ACCEPTABLE TO PHYSICALLY TURN
AWAY REPORTERS.
WATCH.
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WEIGH INTO
RANDOM HYPOTHETICALS THAT MAY OR
MAY NOT EXIST.
MAY NOT EXIST.
>> WE SHOULD NOTE ALL THE
REPORTERS WERE ALLOWED INTO THE
EPA'S AFTERNOON SESSION.
