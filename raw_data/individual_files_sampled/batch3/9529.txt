Bret: HEY GREG, HOW ARE YOU YOU? Bret: THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. WE MIGHT BE NEARING AN ANSWER FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO A SAUDI JOURNALIST AFTER DISAPPEARING TO GO TO THE SAUDI CONSULATES IN AND STUMBLE TURKEY. SOURCES NOW SAY THE SAUDIS WILL EVENTUALLY ADMIT THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED ACCIDENTALLY DURING AN INTERROGATION. THAT NEWS COMES SHORTLY AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SET HIS TOP DIPLOMAT TO THE KINGDOM AND TURKISH AND SAUDI ARABIA INVESTIGATORS DO THAT FOR THE CONSULATE. WE HAVE COVERAGE TONIGHT. JOHN ROBERTS IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND TELLS US WHAT HE IS HEARING THERE. WE START UP WITH CORRESPONDENT BENJAMIN HALL AND HIS TEMPLE. GOOD EVENING.

SAYING "THE KINGDOM CONFIRMS ITS TOTAL REJECTION OF ANY THREAT THAT AN TEMPS TO UNDERMINED IT." SAUDI STATE MEDIA THEN SUGGESTED A HIKE IN OIL PRICES TO $100 IF NOT $200. IN ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT, KING SOLOMON AND THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY SPOKE BY TELEPHONE WITH BOTH ATTEMPTING TO CALL ME SITUATION. THE KING REITERATED HIS COUNTRY'S KEENNESS TO MAINTAIN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH TURKEY THE SAME WAY IT IS AND THAT NO ONE WILL RUIN THAT RELATIONSHIP. PRESSURE ON THE SAUDIS MOUNTS AS MORE BUSINESS SHOWS THEY WILL NOT ATTEND THE CONFERENCE THIS MONTH. THE CEO OF BUBER, RICHARD BRANSON HEAD OF THE WORLD BANK AND THE HEAD OF JPMORGAN AMONG THE FEW TO CANCEL. IT IS ANOTHER MAJOR BLOW TO THE SAUDIS. THAT MAJOR NEWS REPORT BREAKING TONIGHT, POTENTIALLY AT SAUDI ARABIA ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MURDER IS WHAT IS SHOCKING EVERYONE TODAY. WHAT CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WILL
