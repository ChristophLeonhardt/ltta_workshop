GREAT REPORTING. FOR MORE ON ALL OF THIS, LET'S BRING IN THE FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO WHAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM CATHERINE? I THINK IT SHOWS THAT THERE WAS FAIR AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL CORRUPTION IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. AS A FORMER OFFICIAL, IT SCARES ME TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, HOW POLITICIZED PEOPLE ARE BEING. IF YOU HAD A HIGH LEVEL DOJ OFFICIAL LIKE A BRUCE OHR, WHO'S HEAVILY INVOLVED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTER INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS, WHOSE WIFE IS WORKING FOR A POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE OUTFIT BEING PAID FOR BY DEMOCRATS. AT THE VERY LEAST, HE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES HIS WIFE'S FIRM. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SHE'S TAKING SPOUSAL OR TAKING THE FIFTH. IT'S JUST COMMONSENSE. NO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN ANYTHING INVOLVING THEIR SPOUSE. Melissa: LET ME ASK YOU. IS THAT THE PRACTICE? IS THAT WHAT IS EXPECTED? I HAVE HEARD THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE MAKE THE DEFENSE, YOU CAN'T PUNISH SOMEONE FOR WHAT THEIR SPOUSE DOES. THAT'S NOT FAIR. THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN WASHINGTON AND THEY HAVE BOTH PARTIES WORKING AND IT MAY OVERLAP. YOU'RE SAYING IT WOULD BE WITHIN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR THE FBI. YOU CANNOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS BECAUSE YOUR WIFE'S INVOLVED ON THE OTHER SIDE. OH YES. IT'S NOT JUST COMMON SENSE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PUNISHING PEOPLE WHO, COUPLES, BOTH OF WHOM ARE WORKING IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WE'RE NOT SAYING MRS. OHR HAS TO QUIT HER JOB OR MR. OHR HAS TO QUIT HIS JOB. THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THERE ARE BAD GUYS TO CATCH. WHY ISN'T BRUCE OHR WORKING ON OTHER CASES? HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN FUSION GPS. HAND IT OFF TO AN IMPARTIAL OFFICIAL WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HIRED BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO FEED POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE. Melissa: WHAT IF HE WAS THE BACK CHANNEL INTO THE FBI? THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY SOME WHO THEY SAY ARE PRIVY TO THE RECORDS. THAT THIS IS ALL LARGELY DISCREDITED. THAT FUSION HAD BEEN SHOPPING IT AROUND TO BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. IT TOOK BRUCE OHR BACK CHANNELLING IT INTO THE FBI THAT HE WAS WORKING, THIS WORK PRODUCT THAT IT TOOK THAT IN ORDER TO GET IT IN. I MEAN, THEN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IS THERE A PUNISHMENT FOR THAT? FOR AN EXAMPLE, THAT IS EXACTLY WHY HE SHOULD HAVE DISCUSSED HIMSELF. NO MATTER WHAT THE MERITS MAY OR MAY NOT BE, WE WANT TO SEE ALL OF IT DECLASSIFIED AS WELL AS THE FISA WARRANTS THAT WERE BUILT UPON IT. NO MATTER WHAT HE DID, IT'S GOING TO LOOK QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE OF THE CHAIN THAT YOU JUST LAID OUT AND THE CONNECTIONS YOU DESCRIBED. IT'S VERY CLOSE TO WHERE THERE OUGHT TO BE AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL OR SPECIAL COUNSEL APPOINTED TO LOOK INTO THIS. THE APPEARANCE IS THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PAID THE WIFE OF A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TO FEED DISCREDITED INFORMATION AND BECAUSE OF IT, HIGHLY CLASSIFIED, ANTI-ESPIONAGE WARRANT WAS USED. WHICH IS ONLY TO BE USED IN SPECIAL CASES TO SURVEIL THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF THE OPPOSING PARTY. THAT JUST LOOKS TERRIBLE. THERE OUGHT TO BE NOT JUST A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION, BUT THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BY A
