THE FRONT ROW AND PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP APPROACHING THE 
PODIUM NOW. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> THREE DAYS AT THE UNITED 
NATIONS IN NEW YORK. 
THIS IS QUITE A GATHERING OF 
PEOPLE. 
LOT OF MEDIA. 
WE'VE COVERED A GREAT DEAL OF 
TERRITORY, AND JUST LEFT, AS 
YOU KNOW, PRIME MINISTER SHINZO 
ABE OF JAPAN. 
WE ARE STARTING TRADE TALKS 
WITH JAPAN. 
THEY WERE NOT WILLING FOR YEARS 
TO TALK TRADE AND NOW THEY'RE 
WILLING TO TALK TRADE AND I'M 
SURE WE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD 
DEAL. 
JUST CONCLUDED, AS YOU KNOW, 
TWO DAYS AGO, SIGNED A DEAL 
WITH SOUTH KOREA, A TREMENDOUS 
DEAL WAS SOUTH KOREA THAT MEANS 
A LOT OF BUSINESS FOR OUR 
FARMERS. 
WE ARE OPENING UP FOR FARMERS 
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT GROUPS 
AND WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
SO MUCH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE 
NUMBER OF AUTOMOBILES THAT WE 
WERE ALLOWED UNDER THE DEAL 
THAT WAS TOTALLY DEFECTIVE THAT 
WAS THERE BEFORE. 
WE ARE HAPPY WITH THAT AND THAT 
DEAL WAS ACTUALLY CONCLUDED AND 
WE ARE WELL ALONG THE WAY WITH 
MEXICO. 
WITH CANADA, WE WILL SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS. 
THEY CHARGED 300% ON DAIRY 
PRODUCTS AND WE CAN'T HAVE 
THAT. 
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT. 
WITH CHINA, AS YOU KNOW, WE PUT 
OUT AN ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY AND 
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME LOSE 
AN ELECTION BECAUSE THEY'VE 
NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED LIKE 
THIS. 
BUT, I WANT TO OPEN UP CHINA TO 
OUR FARMERS AND OUR 
INDUSTRIALISTS AND OUR 
COMPANIES. 
CHINA IS NOT OPEN BUT WE ARE 
OPEN TO THEM. 
THEY CHARGE US 25, 35, 55% FOR 
THINGS AND WE CHARGE THEM 
NOTHING IN TERMS OF COMING INTO 
THE COUNTRY. 
CARS THAT ARE 25% AND WE ARE 2% 
IN 2.5% AND DON'T EVEN COLLECT 
IT, BUT WE COLLECT IT NOW. 
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL IN OUR 
SITUATION WITH CHINA ON TRADE. 
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA, 
PRESIDENT  Xi. 
BUT, IT'S GOT TO BE A TWO WAY 
STREET. 
TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS WAS 
TAKEN OUT OF THE U.S. FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF CHINA. 
25% INTEREST AND A LOT OF MONEY 
IS COMING INTO OUR COFFERS AND 
IT HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR -- 
ABSOLUTELY -- NO IMPACT ON OUR 
ECONOMY. 
STEEL IS THE HOTTEST INDUSTRY 
THERE IS. 
THEY WANT TO PUT THE STEEL 
COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS AND 
AFTER THAT, THEY WILL COME IN 
WITH FIVE TIMES MORE THAN YOU 
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 
WE NEED STEEL AND ALUMINUM AND 
THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE DOING WELL 
BUT STEEL IS INCREDIBLE. 
U.S. STEEL IS OPENING UP A 
MINIMUM OF EIGHT PLANTS, THESE 
ARE BIG PLANS, $750,000,000.1 
BILLION PLANTS IN SOME CASES. 
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE STEEL 
INDUSTRY, IS VERY EXCITING TO ME
AND IT'S BEING REBUILT 
OVERNIGHT. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MINORS WITH 
COAL AND ENERGY AND JAPAN JUST 
GAVE NUMBERS THAT ARE 
INCREDIBLE. 
THEY ARE DOUBLING THE AMOUNT 
THAT THEY WILL BE BUYING FOR 
JAPAN AND THEY ARE TAKING THE 
LNG AND DOUBLINGIT UP AND I 
SAID, YOU HAVE TO DO ME A 
FAVOR. 
WE DON'T WANT THESE BIG 
DEFICITS. 
YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE AND THEY 
ARE BUYING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF 
EQUIPMENT AND MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
ARE DOING THE SAME THING. 
WE HAVE TRADE IMBALANCES WITH 
ALMOST EVERYBODY. 
IT'S A RARE EXCEPTION THAT WE 
DON'T. 
SO, WE ARE DOING GREAT AS A 
COUNTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY, THEY 
RAISED INTEREST RATES BECAUSE 
THEY ARE DOING SO WELL AND I'M 
NOT HAPPY BECAUSE I KNOW IT 
WILL BE A QUESTION. 
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 
I'D RATHER PAY DOWN DEBT OR DO 
OTHER THINGS, CREATE MORE JOBS. 
SO, I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT THEY SEEM TO LIKE RAISING 
INTEREST RATES. 
WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS WITH THE 
MONEY. 
THEY RAISED THEM AND THEY'RE 
RAISING THEM BECAUSE WE ARE 
DOING SO WELL. 
WE ARE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN I 
HAD PROJECTED, IN TERMS OF WHEN 
I WAS CAMPAIGNING. 
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS 
AND WE ARE DOING MUCH BETTER 
THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT 
POSSIBLE. 
I WILL SAY, IF OTHERS GOT IN, 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST THE 
OPPOSITE BECAUSE THEY WERE 
GOING TO PUT ON RESTRICTIONS 
AND REGULATIONS AND THEY WOULD 
HAVE CHOKED THE ECONOMY AS IT 
WAS ALREADY CHOKING BUT IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE AND THEY 
WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD DO NOW 
IF THEY EVER GOT CONTROL. I 
DON'T THINK THEY WILL HAVE 
CONTROL FOR A LONG TIME. 
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE WILL 
TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 
OF COURSE, WE ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO TOMORROW, FOR THE 
HEARINGS WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
>> YES. 
>> IN 1991 WHEN JOE BIDEN 
PASSED THE LAW TO THE BUSH 41 
WHITE HOUSE, THE ALLEGATIONS 
THAT ANITA HILL HAD RAISED 
AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS, THE 
BUSH WHITE HOUSE ASKED THE FBI 
TO LOOK INTO IT AS PART OF JUDGE
THOMAS' BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION. 
NOT A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. 
WHEN THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE 
RAISED, WHY DIDN'T THIS WHITE 
HOUSE DO THE SAME THING. WITH 
ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS COMING 
OUT NOW ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
WAS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY MISSED 
TO HAVE INVESTIGATORS LOOK INTO 
THIS AND GET SOME SORT OF 
CLARITY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? 
>> THE FBI TOLD US THEY'VE 
INVESTIGATED JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
SIX TIMES, FIVE TIMES, MANY 
TIMES OVER THE YEARS. 
THEY KNOW HIM VERY WELL. 
HERE, THERE WAS NOTHING TO 
INVESTIGATE FROM AT LEAST ONE 
STANDPOINT. 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE LOCATION, 
THE TIME, THE YEAR AND THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. 
IT'S LIKE, WHERE DO YOU GO. 
ALSO, IT'S NOT FOR THE FBI IF 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT JOE BIDEN 
SAID. 
HE SAID THEY DON'T DO THIS AND 
HE SAID IT VERY CLEARLY. 
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT 
ALL, IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE 
AND THEY OF THE DEMOCRATS 
MINDS. 
THEIR OBSTRUCTIONISTS. 
THERE ACTUALLY CON ARTISTS 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW QUALITY 
THIS MAN IS. 
THEY WANT TO DESTROY HIS 
REPUTATION AND IN THE MIDTERMS, 
WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS 
FAMILY AND THESE CHILDREN, 
THESE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN OF HIS 
AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO HIS 
WIFE -- THEY KNOW IT'S A BIG 
FAT CON JOB. 
THEY GO INTO A ROOM AND I 
GUARANTEE YOU THEY LAUGH LIKE 
HECK AT WHAT THEY PULLED OFF ON 
YOU AND ON THE PUBLIC. 
THEY LAUGHED LIKE OH. 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF 
THE FBI CAME BACK WITH THE 
CLEANEST SCORE, AND YOU 
UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL, 
JOHN. 
OF THEY WOULD HAVE COME BACK 
WITH A MOST PERFECT -- WE FOUND 
EVERYTHING AND HE'S PERFECTLY 
INNOCENT OF EVERYTHING -- 
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A 
DIFFERENCE. 
HE WOULDN'T HAVE ONE VOTE. 
WE WILL GET VOTES FROM THE 
DEMOCRATS IF WE WIN. 
YOU'LL HAVE THREE, FOUR OR FIVE 
DEMOCRATS GIVING US VOTES 
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN STATES I 
WON BY 30 AND 40 POINTS AND 
THEY WILL GIVE US VOTES. 
OTHER THAN THAT YOU PROBABLY 
WON'T GET ANY. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THERE ARE IN 
ALL THREE WOMEN ACCUSING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL THREE 
OF THOSE WOMEN ARE LIARS? 
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE 
SAID TOMORROW THAT COULD CAUSE 
YOU TO WITHDRAW THE NOMINATION, 
ANYTHING AT ALL? 
>> I WON'T GET INTO THAT GAME. I
ONLY TELL YOU THIS. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 
QUALITY PEOPLE THAT I'VE EVER 
MET AND EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS 
HIM SAYS THE SAME THING. 
THESE ARE ALL FALSE, TO ME. 
THESE ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS IN 
CERTAIN CASES AND CERTAIN 
CASES, EVEN THE MEDIA AGREES 
WITH THAT. 
I CAN ONLY SAME THAT WHAT 
THEY'VE DONE TO THIS MAN IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
IT'S VERY INTERESTING. I 
PICK A LOT OF JUDGES. 
I HAVE 145 JUDGES I WILL BE 
PICKING BY THE END OF ASSURE -- 
AND OF A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WASN'T BIG ON 
PICKING JUDGES AND I SAID, HOW 
IS THIS POSSIBLE? 
I HAVE 145 INCLUDING COURT OF 
APPEALS JUDGES. 
THEY JUST DIDN'T DO IT. 
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 
THEY GOT TIRED. 
THEY GOT COMPLACENT. 
SOMETHING HAPPEN. I 
HAVE 145 JUDGES. 
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A FEDERAL 
JUDGE, NOT JUST A SUPREME COURT 
JUDGE. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT COURT OF 
APPEALS, DISTRICT COURT. 
I DON'T THINK THEY WILL WANT TO 
SO MUCH. 
I WILL CALL PEOPLE AND WE WILL 
HAVE PEOPLE CALLING PEOPLE WHO 
DO THIS AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
BE SCARED BECAUSE WE COULD SAY 
IT ABOUT YOU. 
35 YEARS AGO AND YOU MIGHT NOT 
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WHAT IS 
GOING ON AND WHY DID THEY WAIT? 
WHY DID SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAIT 
UNTIL THE HEARINGS WERE OVER 
AND MAKE THIS CASE? 
WHY DIDN'T SHE BRING IT AT THE 
BEGINNING? 
WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING THIS 
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING DURING 
THE HEARING? 
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD ALL THE 
TIME IN THE WORLD FOR THE FBI. 
THE FBI DID INVESTIGATE THIS 
TIME AS THEY HAVE FIVE OR SIX 
OTHER TIMES AND THEY DID A VERY 
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. 
BUT, THIS IS A BIG CON JOB AND 
I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN THE ROOM 
WITH THE DEMOCRATS, CLOSE THE 
DOOR AND YOU GUYS ARE ALL THE 
WAY OUTSIDE WAITING AND SCHUMER 
AND HIS BUDDIES ARE ALL IN 
THERE LAUGHING. HOW THEY FOOLED 
YOU ALL. 
LET'S JUST STOP THEM. 
A BIG FAT CON. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE 
DAUGHTERS. 
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHY A VICTIM 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD NOT 
REPORT IT AT THE TIME? 
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? 
>> BY THE WAY, I ONLY SAY THIS. 
36 YEARS, NO CHARGE, NO 
NOTHING. 
EVERYBODY -- >> THAT HAPPENS 
OFTEN. 
>> PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE A 
DECISION. 
36 YEARS, NO CHARGE AND ALL OF 
A SUDDEN THE HEARINGS ARE OVER 
AND THE RUMORS START COMING OUT 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS OTHER 
CON ARTIST ARTIST, AVENATTI, 
COME OUT WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY 
TODAY. I 
ALWAYS SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO 
LOOK AT THE FACTS. 
THE SENATORS ARE VERY CAPABLE 
PEOPLE, VERY GOOD PEOPLE. I 
KNOW MANY OF THEM AND THEY ARE 
FRIENDS OF MINE. 
THESE ARE VERY TALENTED, VERY 
GOOD PEOPLE AND THEY ARE GOING 
TO VOTE. 
THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE WHAT THEY 
BELIEVE. 
WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED 
TO THE REPUTATION OF A GREAT 
GENTLEMAN, A GREAT INTELLECT, A 
BRILLIANT MAN AND SOMEBODY THAT 
HAS A CHANCE TO BE ONE OF OUR 
GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN 
HISTORY, INTELLECTUALLY, I 
THINK IT'S A SHAME. 
YES? 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY AT 
THE SPEECH AT THE U.N., YOU 
SPOKE ABOUT HOW VENEZUELA'S 
PROBLEM WAS BECAUSE OF CUBA AND 
THE CASTRO'S AND HOW THEY WENT 
IN AND BROUGHT SOCIALISM AND 
COMMUNISM TO VENEZUELA AND NOW 
TO NICARAGUA, AS WELL. 
MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU GOING TO 
BE MORE PROACTIVE NOW AGAINST 
CUBA, AS WELL? 
>> I'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE 
AGAINST CUBA. 
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
IN CUBA. 
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA 
GAVE THEM A PASS AND I DIDN'T 
LIKE IT. 
NEITHER DO CUBAN PEOPLE BASED 
IN MIAMI AND OUR COUNTRY WHO 
CAME FROM CUBA AND SUFFERED 
FROM CUBA. 
I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE DID AND 
I'VE ENDED MUCH OF IT, MOST OF 
IT. 
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
IN CUBA AND I CERTAINLY DON'T 
LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 
VENEZUELA. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TO 
FINISH, YOU SAID ALSO THAT YOU 
HAD A CALL TO ACTION TO ASK THE 
LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD TO 
ALSO AND SOCIALISM. 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 
RECOGNIZED? 
>> I WOULDN'T SAY THAT 
SOCIALISM HAS BEEN WORKING 
REALLY WELL AROUND THE WORLD. 
OKAY? 
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT VENEZUELA
AS THEIR NUMBER ONE, THE ONE 
MOST OBVIOUS BUT TAKE A LOOK 
AROUND THE WORLD AND SOCIALISM 
 
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND, AFTER I'M 
FINISHED, IF WEIJIA JIANG OR ONE
OF OUR FEMALE COLLEAGUES COULD 
GO AFTER ME, THAT WOULD BE 
GREAT. 
MR. PRESIDENT, TO FOLLOW UP ON 
THE ALLEGATIONS -- 
>> WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT? 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
>> IF IT WOULD BE GREAT IF A 
FEMALE -- 
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
>> OF A FEMALE REPORTER WOULD 
ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS 
ISSUE. 
>> I WOULDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL. 
WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO 
ME. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON JOHN 
AND JOHN'S QUESTION. 
WHY IS IT, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT 
YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO SIDE WITH 
THE ACCUSED AND NOT THE 
ACCUSER? 
YOU HAVE THREE WOMEN HERE WHO 
ARE ALL MAKING ALLEGATIONS, ALL 
ASKING THAT THEIR STORIES BE 
HEARD. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF ROY 
MOORE, THE CASE OF ONE OF YOUR 
STAFFERS, YOU SEEM TO TIME AND 
AGAIN SIDE WITH THE ACCUSED AND 
NOT THE ACCUSER. 
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MANY 
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU'VE HAD 
MADE AGAINST YOU OVER THE 
YEARS? 
>> FIRST OF ALL, I WASN'T HAPPY 
WITH ROY MOORE. 
LET'S GET THAT STRAIGHT. 
ROY MOORE WAS A REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATE AND I WOULD HAVE 
RATHER HAD A REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATE. 
I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH LUTHER 
STRANGE, A TERRIFIC MAN FROM 
ALABAMA BUT LUTHER STRANGE HAD 
A LOT OF THINGS GOING AGAINST 
HIM. 
AS FAR AS WOMEN, WHETHER A MAN 
OR WOMAN, IT CAN HAPPEN THE 
OTHER WAY. 
ALLEGATIONS CAN GO THE OTHER 
WAY. 
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AND WHETHER 
IT WAS A MAN OR A WOMAN, 30 
YEARS AGO, 36 YEARS AGO -- IN 
FACT, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY 
YEARS AGO BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS 
WHAT THE TIME IS. 
THAT IS A LONG TIME. 
AS AN EXAMPLE, AND HOPEFULLY I 
WON'T HAVE TO DO IT AS A 
REPLACEMENT, BECAUSE HOPEFULLY, 
THIS IS GOING TO GO VERY WELL 
ON THURSDAY AND GO VERY WELL ON 
MONDAY OR SATURDAY OR SUNDAY OR 
WHENEVER THEY VOTE. 
BUT, I COULD PICK A WOMAN AND 
SHE COULD HAVE CHARGES MADE 
FROM MANY YEARS AGO, ALSO. 
I WOULD LOOK AT THE CHARACTER. 
WHAT I HAVE TO DO -- >> THEY 
ARE RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD 
AND YOU'VE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT 
THE ACCUSERS. 
>> I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE 
RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD. 
THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK. 
EXCUSE ME. 
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO 
SPEAK. IT WILL BE TOMORROW, I 
ASSUME. 
WE'VE DELAYED THIS -- MEANING 
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS, NOT ME 
-- THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE 
DELAYED THIS FOR WEEKS, NOW. 
THEY ARE GIVING THE WOMEN A 
MAJOR CHANCE TO SPEAK. 
NOW, IT'S POSSIBLE I WILL HEAR 
THAT AND I WILL SAY, I'M 
CHANGING MY MIND. 
THAT IS POSSIBLE. 
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE 
TO SPEAK AND THEY ARE GIVEN -- 
>> ALL THREE? 3
>> WELL, WHOEVER IS GIVEN A 
CHANCE. 
WE'VE DELAYED IT A LONG TIME 
BUT THEY WILL HAVE A BIG SHOT 
AT SPEAKING AND MAKING THEIR 
CASE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I COULD BE PERSUADED, ALSO, 
OKAY? 
PLEASE GO AHEAD. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW-
UP ON ANSWERS I DIDN'T QUITE 
HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU WOULD 
ALLOW ME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. 
FIST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK 
THESE WOMEN, ALL THREE OF THEM, 
ARE LIARS? 
>> ARE THEY WHAT? 
>> LIARS. 
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU. I 
HAVE TO WATCH TOMORROW. I 
JUST HEARD ABOUT ONE OF THEM A 
LITTLE WHILE AGO. I 
CAN TELL YOU HER LAWYER IS A 
LOW LIFE. I 
CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THE LIES 
UNTIL I HEAR THEM. I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY 
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BUSY WITH 
JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA AND 
ABOUT SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS 
YOU KNOW AND I CHAIRED THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL. I 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT TODAY'S PERSON 
THAT CAME FORWARD. 
I DO KNOW ABOUT THE LAWYER AND 
YOU DON'T GET MUCH WORSE BAD 
REPUTATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT 
HIS PAST. 
AS FAR AS THE OTHER WOMEN ARE 
CONCERNED, I'M GOING TO SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW. 
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING, 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 
I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT IS SAID. 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL BE 
CONVINCING. 
NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING 
SAID, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS 
BEEN, FOR MANY YEARS, ONE OF 
THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
HE'S BEEN ON -- I GUESS YOU 
WOULD CALL IT -- THE SECOND 
HIGHEST COURT AND EVERY SINGLE 
PERSON THAT KNOWS HIM -- AND 
PEOPLE KNOW HIM WELL -- THOSE 
PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE WHAT'S 
GOING ON. 
I CAN ALWAYS BE CONVINCED. 
I HAVE TO HEAR IT. 
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU ARE 
SAYING THAT THERE IS A 
SITUATION, A SCENARIO, UNDER 
WITH -- UNDER WHICH HE WOULD 
WITHDRAW BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION? 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> IF I THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY 
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YES, 
SURE. 
>> HE WILL WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW 
TO DECIDE? 
>> I HOPE I CAN WATCH. 
I'M MEETING WITH A LOT OF 
COUNTRIES TOMORROW BUT IN SOME 
FORM I WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH 
AND I WILL RELY ON SOME VERY 
FAIR AND TALENTED REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS WHO -- LOOK -- IF WE 
BROUGHT GEORGE WASHINGTON HERE 
AND WE SAID, WE HAVE GEORGE 
WASHINGTON, THE DEMOCRATS WOULD 
VOTE AGAINST HIM, JUST SO YOU 
UNDERSTAND. 
HE MAY HAVE HAD A BAD PAST, WHO 
KNOWS. 
HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME 
ACCUSATIONS MADE. 
DIDN'T HE HAVE A COUPLE OF 
THINGS IN HIS PAST? 
GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD BE VOTED
AGAINST 100% BY SCHUMER AND THE 
CON ARTISTS. 
100%. 
SO, REALLY DOESN'T MATTER FROM 
THEIR STANDPOINT. 
WHEN JOHN ASKED ABOUT THE FBI, 
IF THE FBI DID THE MOST 
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE FBI AND THEY 
FOUND HIM TO BE 100% PERFECT, 
HE WOULD LOSE EVERY SINGLE 
VOTE. 
NOW, IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN 
TOMORROW, I THINK YOU WILL GET 
SOME VOTES FROM THE DEMOCRATS. 
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 
WE ALL KNOW WHY. 
IT'S CALLED POLITICS AND THEN 
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET SOME VOTES. 
LET'S GO. 
ONE MORE QUESTION. 
I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THREE 
QUESTIONS. 
IT'S NOT REALLY FAIR. 
SHOULD I LET HER ASK ANOTHER 
QUESTION? 
GO AHEAD. 
>> TO FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION A 
COLLEAGUE ASKED ABOUT THE 
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THAT YOU 
HAVE GIVEN TO PEOPLE LIKE ROY 
MOORE, ROGER AILES, BILL 
O'REILLY AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
THEY ARE ALL MEN. 
WHY IS THAT? 
>> IT'S NOT A BENEFIT OF THE 
DOUBT. 
>> YOU'VE GIVEN THEM THE 
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. 
>> I'VE KNOWN THEM A LONG TIME, 
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
SOME, I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED 
WITH. 
I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH 
SOME OTHERS LIKE, YOU KNOW, 
THERE ARE JUDGES THAT ARE WEAK 
BUT I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE FOR A 
LONG TIME AND I NEVER SAW THEM 
DO ANYTHING WRONG. I 
NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING 
WRONG AND THERE ARE SOME THAT I 
AGREE, SOME THAT I'VE BEEN 
WATCHING FOR A LONG TIME. 
IN A COUPLE OF CASES, THEY 
WEREN'T REPUBLICANS AND IN A 
LOT OF CASES THEY WERE NOT. 
THEY WERE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE 
BUT I'VE BEEN WATCHING THEM FOR 
A LONG TIME AND I KNEW FOR A 
LONG TIME THESE WERE NOT GOOD 
PEOPLE AND THEY WERE NEVER 
BROUGHT UP. 
OKAY -- YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BY THE 
WAY. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN THE 
ALLEGATIONS FIRST SURFACED, YOU 
INITIALLY SAID HOW IMPORTANT IT 
WAS FOR DR. FORD TO TESTIFY. 
AND, THAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR 
FROM HER. 
>> I DO. I 
WISH IT COULD'VE GONE QUICKER. 
>> YOU ALSO SAID THAT IF WHAT 
SHE SAID WERE AS BAD AS SHE 
CLAIMS, SURELY HER OR HER 
PARENTS WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT. 
JUST TODAY YOU SAID -- 
>> THERE IS THE TRUTH. 
THERE IS A CHANCE HER PARENTS 
COULD HAVE REPORTED A 36 YEARS 
AGO. 
>> MY QUESTION IS -- 
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAD TO 
REPORT IT. 
IN SOME INSTANCES, PEOPLE KEEP 
IT QUIET. 
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION FOR 
A WOMAN, NO QUESTION AND IN 
SOME CASES THEY DO REPORT IT. 
FRANKLY, HAD THEY REPORTED IT, 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY 
AMAZING, WOULDN'T IT? 
BUT, I GUESS THEY DIDN'T AND 
THAT'S OKAY. 
I'M NOT SAYING THEY HAD TO 
REPORT IT. 
IT'S A VERY PERSONAL THING, A 
VERY BIG PROBLEM AND NO 
QUESTION ABOUT IT. 
>> DO YOU WANT TO HEAR HER 
STORY? 
>> I LIKE TO HEAR HER STORY. 
WE ARE GIVING HER TIME. 
THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER TIME 
LAST WEEK. 
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE. 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
POSITION THAT A PRESIDENT CAN 
GIVE VOTE. I 
THINK WE CAN SAY, BY FAR. 
I'VE HEARD IT'S THE MOST 
IMPORTANT DECISION A PRESIDENT 
CAN MAKE. I 
DISAGREE WITH THAT. 
WAR AND PEACE, I ALWAYS SAY WAR 
AND PEACE AND AFTER THAT, 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, RIGHT? 
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM 
HER. 
WE COULD HAVE HEARD FROM HER 
LAST WEEK AND WE COULD HAVE 
HEARD FROM HER FOR A LONG TIME. 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR 
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY, OKAY? 
>> LET ME FOLLOW UP ON JIM'S 
QUESTION. 
MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME FOLLOW UP 
ON JIM'S QUESTION THAT WE 
DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER TO. 
>> WHICH QUESTION? 
>> HAVE YOUR PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCES, BEING ACCUSED -- 
>> I'VE BEEN ACCUSED. 
FALSE ACCUSATIONS. 
EXCUSE ME. 
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED AND I WAS 
ACCUSED BY, I BELIEVE IT WAS 
FOUR WOMEN. 
YOU CAN CHECK WITH SEAN HANNITY 
AND YOU CAN CHECK WITH FOX 
BECAUSE THEY COVERED IT VERY 
STRONGLY. 
EXCUSE ME. I 
WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE 
WOMEN WHO GOT PAID A LOT OF 
MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT 
ME. 
WE CAUGHT THEM IN THE 
MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND THEY 
REFUSED TO PUT IT ON 
TELEVISION, REFUSED TO WRITE 
ABOUT IT. 
THEY WERE FOUR WOMEN AND MAYBE 
MORE AND I THINK THE NUMBER IS 
FOUR OR FIVE. 
ONE HAD A MORTGAGE PAID OFF HER 
HOUSE, $52,000 AND ANOTHER ONE 
HAD OTHER THINGS HAPPEN. 
THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT, I 
BELIEVE, WAS OFFERED $750,000 
TO SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT ME AND 
SHE IS THE ONE THAT REPORTED 
IT. 
THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE. 
SHE REPORTED IT INSTEAD OF 
TAKING THE MONEY. 
SO, I'VE HAD NUMEROUS 
ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ME. 
I MEAN, THEY MADE FALSE 
STATEMENTS ABOUT ME. 
KNOWING THEY WERE FALSE. I 
NEVER MET THEM. I 
NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT 
DID THE DO? WHAT DID THEY DO? 
THEY TOOK MONEY IN ORDER TO SAY 
BAD THINGS. 
I'VE HAD STORIES WRITTEN IN THE 
NEW YORK TIMES, FRONT PAGE, 
ABOUT FOUR WOMEN. 
THE WHOLE TOP CENTER FRONT PAGE 
OF THE NEW YORK TIMES. I 
THINK IT WAS FOUR BIG PICTURES. 
I SAID, WOW, THAT'S A BIG 
THING. 
WHAT'S THAT? 
THESE WERE WOMEN QUOTED SAYING 
BAD THINGS ABOUT ME. 
NOT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT ME, 
BUT BAD THINGS. 
I SAID, THAT'S TOO BAD. I 
KNEW THEM A LONG TIME AGO, 15 
YEARS OR 20 YEARS. 
THAT'S TOO BAD. 
I'M SURPRISED AND THEN I SEE 
THEM ON TELEVISION, NOTHING TO 
DO WITH ME. 
THE NEXT DAY OR A DAY LATER, 
THEY WERE INCENSED. 
THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP IS A NICE
GUY. 
WE NEVER SAID THIS. 
THE NEW YORK TIMES DID FALSE 
REPORTING. 
THEY ARE FAKE NEWS AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
THE NEW YORK TIMES WOULD NOT 
REPORT THAT THE STORY WAS FAKE. 
THESE WOMEN SAID GREAT THINGS. 
NOT ONLY DID THEY NOT SAVE THE 
BAD STUFF, THEY SAID GREAT 
THINGS ABOUT ME, FRONT PAGE. 
THOSE WOMEN, THEY ARE 
INCREDIBLE WOMEN, THEY WENT ON 
TELEVISION AND THEY DIDN'T WANT 
TO AND I DIDN'T DO ASK THEM. 
THEY SAID, THE NEW YORK TIMES 
MADE IT OUT. 
THEY GAVE FALSE QUOTES AND THEY 
WENT ON A LOT OF SHOWS. 
THEY WERE INCENSED AND COULDN'T 
BELIEVE IT. 
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE KNOW THAT A 
LOT OF THE NEWS IS FAKE AND A 
LOT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE 
ARE FAKE. 
BUT 20% OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL, 
OKAY? 
GO AHEAD. 
>> MR. TRUMP, YOU DIDN'T LET ME 
ASK MY QUESTION. 
>> YOU'VE BEEN ASKING A 
QUESTION FOR 10 MINUTES. 
PLEASE SIT DOWN. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> HOW DID THAT IMPACT OUR 
OPINIONS ON THE ALLEGATIONS? 
>> IT DOES IMPACT MY OPINION. 
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF FALSE CHARGES 
MADE AGAINST ME. 
I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON, 
UNFORTUNATELY. 
I'VE BEEN FAMOUS FOR A LONG 
TIME AND I'VE HAD REALLY FALSE 
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME AND I 
KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD 
FALSE CHARGES. 
PEOPLE WANT FAME. 
THEY WANT MONEY. 
THEY WANT WHATEVER. 
SO, WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT 
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEONE 
SITTING HOME AND WATCHING 
TELEVISION WHERE THEY SAY, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THIS OR THAT. 
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES. 
I'VE HAD MANY FALSE CHARGES. I 
HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN 
AIRPLANE AND I ATTACKED HER 
WHILE PEOPLE WERE COMING ONTO 
THE PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER 
ONE BEST SELLER OUT? 
IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY STORY AND 
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. 
WHEN YOU SAY DOESN'T AFFECT ME 
IN TERMS OF MY THINKING WITH 
RESPECT TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
ABSOLUTELY. 
BECAUSE, I'VE HAD IT MANY 
TIMES. 
IF THE NEWS WOULD HAVE REPORTED 
THESE FOUR PEOPLE, AND I 
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT -- WHEN I 
HEARD THEY CAUGHT THESE FOUR 
PEOPLE, I SAID, THAT'S A BIG 
STORY AND IT WAS FOR FOX. 
OKAY. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, EARLIER TODAY 
AND JUST KNOW YOU MADE A 
SIGNIFICANT ALLEGATION AGAINST 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. 
YOU SUGGESTED BUDGET -- YOU 
SUGGESTED THE CHINESE HAD 
MEDDLED IN THE ELECTION. 
>> THAT'S WHAT I HEAR. 
>> WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE? 
>> WE HAVE EVIDENCE. 
IT WILL COME OUT. I 
CAN'T TELL YOU NOW. 
IT DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE, 
THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU. 
THEY'VE ADMITTED THEY ARE GOING 
AFTER FARMERS. 
MOST OF YOU CAN COVER THAT. I 
LIKE THAT YOU ARE SHAKING YOUR 
HEAD AND I WILL ASK YOU THE 
NEXT QUESTION BECAUSE OF THAT. 
YOU WILL PROBABLY BE THE KILLER 
OF ALL QUESTIONS. 
>> CAN YOU COME FORWARD WITH 
THE EVIDENCE? 
>> CHINA PUT OUT $250 BILLION 
AND THEY ARE PAYING 25%, THEY 
ARE PAYING BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS AND THIS HAS NEVER 
HAPPENED TO CHINA. 
I LIKE CHINA AND I LIKE 
PRESIDENT  Xi A LOT. 
I THINK HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. 
HE MAY NOT BE A FRIEND OF MINE 
ANYMORE BUT I THINK YOU 
PROBABLY RESPECTS ME, AND FROM 
ON WHAT I HEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT 
MR. PILLSBURY, THE LEADING 
AUTHORITY ON CHINA AND HE WAS 
ON A GOOD SHOW -- I WON'T 
MENTION THE NAME OF THE SHOW -- 
BUT HE SAID CHINA HAS TOTAL 
RESPECT FOR DONALD TRUMP AND 
FOR DONALD TRUMP'S VERY, VERY 
LARGE BRAIN. 
HE SAID DONALD TRUMP, THEY 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. 
NEVER HAPPEN. 
ONE THING THEY ARE TRYING TO DO 
IS CONVINCE PEOPLE TO GO 
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE A 
NORMAL REGULAR POLITICAL PERSON 
THAT HAS NO CONCEPT OF WHAT THE 
HECK HE'S DOING, WOULD LET 
CHINA CONTINUE TO TAKE $500 
BILLION A YEAR OUT OF OUR 
COUNTRY AND REBUILD THEIR 
COUNTRY. 
THEY WERE BUILDING 29 MASSIVE 
BRIDGES LIKE THE GEORGE 
WASHINGTON BRIDGE. 
THEY ARE BUILDING THINGS THAT 
WE DON'T BUILD ANYMORE. 
WE ARE STARTING TO BUILD THEM 
AGAIN AND OUR ECONOMY IS HOTTER 
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE 
CONFIDENCE LEVELS THIS MORNING 
THAT JUST CAME OUT, FANTASTIC 
AND IN ALL FAIRNESS TO THE FED 
RAISING RATES, THEY ARE RAISING 
RATES BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER DONE 
LIKE WE ARE DOING NOW AND ONE 
OF THE THINGS IT IS NICE ABOUT 
THE RATES, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE 
HURT THE WORST BY THE ZERO 
INTEREST RATES -- YOU KNOW -- 
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD AN ECONOMY 
AND IT WAS THE WORST COMEBACK 
SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND 
YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT BUT 
REMEMBER, HE WAS PLAYING WITH 
ZERO INTEREST MONEY, FUNNY 
MONEY. 
THAT'S EASY. 
I'M PLAYING WITH FAIRLY 
EXPENSIVE MONEY. 
WHEN HE DOES THAT, THE PEOPLE 
THAT BENEFIT ARE PEOPLE THAT 
ACTUALLY, IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE, 
THEY WOULD SAVE 10%, 15% IN THE 
BANK AND THOSE PEOPLE GOT 
KILLED BECAUSE THEY PUT THEIR 
MONEY IN THE BANK AND WERE 
GOING TO LIVE OFF THE INTEREST 
AND THERE WAS NO INTEREST. 
NOW, THOSE PEOPLE ARE STARTING 
TO GET INTEREST IN THOSE ARE 
THE PEOPLE, FRANKLY, THAT DID A 
GREAT JOB AND THE PEOPLE THAT 
DID IT RIGHT, THAT DID THE BEST 
JOB GOT HURT THE MOST. 
BASICALLY, I'M A LOW INTEREST 
RATE PERSON, I HATE TO TELL 
YOU. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE 
ANOTHER MEETING TOMORROW WITH 
ROD ROSENSTEIN. 
ARE YOU PLANNING TO FIRE ROD 
ROSENSTEIN? 
>> I'M TALKING TO HIM. 
WE'VE HAD A GOOD TALK AND HE 
SAID HE NEVER SAID IT AND SAID 
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT AND SAID 
HE HAS A LOT OF RESPECT FOR ME 
AND HE WAS VERY NICE AND WE 
WILL SEE. 
HE'S A MEMBER OF THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION AND THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. I 
WOULD CERTAINLY PREFER NOT 
DOING THAT. 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION, NO 
OBSTRUCTION UNLESS YOU CALL 
OBSTRUCTION THE FACT THAT I 
FIGHT BACK. 
I DO FIGHT BACK. I 
REALLY FIGHT BACK. 
IF YOU CALL THAT OBSTRUCTION, 
THAT'S FINE BUT THERE'S NO 
OBSTRUCTION, NO COLLUSION AND 
I'M GOING TO MEET WITH HIM 
TOMORROW AND I MAY CALL ROD 
TONIGHT OR TOMORROW AND ASK FOR 
A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY BECAUSE 
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING 
THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THIS 
VERY IMPORTANT SUPREME COURT. 
I DON'T WANT TO COMPETE AND 
HURT THE DECISION ONE WAY OR 
THE OTHER. 
AGAIN, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE 
HAS TO SAY. 
I MAY DELAY THAT. 
I'M GOING TO SEE. 
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING 
THAT WILL CONFLICT WITH THAT 
BUT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO 
KEEP HIM. 
AND, TO LET HIM FINISH UP. 
YOU KNOW WHY CALL IT A WITCH 
HUNT AND IT IS A WITCH HUNT. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FBI 
STATEMENTS WITH PETER STRZOK 
AND HIS LOVER, LISA PAGE, AND 
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE THINGS
THAT HAVE GONE ON IN THE FBI 
AND YOU LOOK AT MCCABE TAKING 
$700,000 FROM A HILLARY CLINTON 
PACK, ESSENTIALLY RUN BY TERRY 
MCAULIFFE, AND HE GIVES THEM 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
AND HE'S IN CHARGE OF HER 
CAMPAIGN AND HIS WIFE IS 
GETTING ALL OF THIS MONEY? TO 
RUN? 
SHE LOST. 
WHAT'S GOING ON? 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HORRIBLE 
STATEMENTS LIKE WAY TO GO, PAGE,
GREAT STORY YOU PUT INTO A 
NEWSPAPER. 
ESSENTIALLY, NOW WE WILL GO AND 
INVESTIGATE THAT GROUP. 
IT'S TERRIBLE. 
WE HAVE CAUGHT PEOPLE DOING 
THINGS THAT ARE TERRIBLE. I 
WOULD MUCH PREFER KEEPING ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, MUCH PREFER. 
MANY PEOPLE SAY I HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO FIRE HIM. 
HE SAID HE DID NOT SAY IT AND 
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AND 
NOBODY IN THIS ROOM BELIEVES 
THAT. 
BY THE WAY, I DEAL WITH THESE 
PEOPLE. 
I WAS WITH MIKE POMPEO AND WE 
WERE DEALING AT A VERY HIGH 
LEVEL WITH JAPAN. 
NOW WE ARE SAYING THINGS THAT 
NOBODY IN THE ROOM EVEN 
UNDERSTOOD AND I SAID THEM A 
LONG TIME AGO AND I WAS RIGHT. 
HE SAID, THAT'S NOT THE 25TH 
AMENDMENT I'M LOOKING AT. I 
THINK I CAN SAY THAT FOR MIKE. 
>> NO ONE IN YOUR 
ADMINISTRATION HAS EVER 
DISCUSSED USING THE 25TH 
AMENDMENT AGAINST YOU? 
>> ENEMIES, SURE. 
>> IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION? 
>> THEY USE ANYTHING THEY CAN. 
THEY ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME. 
THEY WON'T BEAT ME IN THE 
ELECTION AND THEY KNOW THAT. 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME. 
THE PEOPLE I'M LOOKING AT OUR 
TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHTS. 
I DREAM OF RUNNING AGAINST 
THOSE PEOPLE. 
MAYBE I WILL COME AGAINST 
SOMEONE THAT'S NOT. 
I'M AGAINST WHAT THEY WANT TO 
DO AND I'M IN FAVOR OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
I'M IN FAVOR OF SAFETY AND 
SECURITY AND LOW TAXES. I 
WANT LOW TAXES. I 
WANT BORDERS. 
WE ARE GETTING ANOTHER $1.6 
BILLION IN BORDERS. I 
WANT BORDERS. 
WE'VE SPENT $3.2 BILLION AND WE 
ARE GETTING $1.6 BILLION AND 
THEN WE WILL COMPLETE THE WALL. 
THEY DON'T WANT THAT. 
THEY DON'T WANT THAT. 
THEY DON'T WANT THE THINGS THAT 
I HAVE. I 
MUST SAY I KNOW MANY OF THE 
DEMOCRATS WILL SAY THINGS AND 
THEN WINKED AT ME. 
AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY. 
THEY WILL SAY THINGS THAT THEY 
DON'T MEAN. 
IT'S POLITICS. 
THE REASON THEY DON'T WANT ME 
IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO RUN THE 
SHOW. 
THEY WANT IT. 
IT'S POWER, WHATEVER YOU WANT 
TO CALL IT. 
WHAT THEY'VE DONE HERE IS A 
DISGRACE, A TOTAL DISGRACE. 
WHAT THEY DO IS INTERESTING. 
IN ONE CASE, THEY SAY HE'S A 
FASCIST, HE'S TAKING OVER THE 
GOVERNMENT, THE MOST POWERFUL 
PRESIDENT, EVER, A HORRIBLE 
HUMAN BEING AND HE WANTS TO 
TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT 
AND WE CAN'T STOP HIM. 
THAT DIDN'T WORK AND THE NEXT 
WEEK THEY SAID, HE'S 
INCOMPETENT. 
WAIT A MINUTE. 
IN ONE CASE I'M TAKING OVER THE 
WORLD AND IN THE OTHER CASE 
INCOMPETENT? 
THEY TRIED THAT FOR A WEEK AND 
THAT DIDN'T WORK. 
LOOK -- THESE ARE VERY 
DISHONEST PEOPLE, CON ARTISTS. 
AND THE PRESS KNOWS IT, BUT THE 
PRESS DOESN'T WRITE IT. 
THAT IS A LOT OF HANDS. 
THAT IS A LOT. 
STEVE, GO AHEAD. 
A VERY HIGH-QUALITY PERSON, 
THIS MAN. 
GIVE IT TO ME. 
REUTERS. 
>> YOU ARE GETTING LETTERS FROM 
CHAIRMAN KIM, WHY DO NEED A 
SECOND SUMMIT SO SOON? 
>> BECAUSE HE'D LIKE ONE. 
>> WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR? 
>> I'VE RECEIVED TWO LETTERS 
FROM CHAIRMAN KIM AND AT SOME 
POINT I WILL GIVE OUT THESE 
LETTERS. 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE LETTERS. 
THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT IN THE 
SENSE OF HIS FEELING FOR 
WANTING TO GET THIS DONE. 
I REALLY BELIEVE HE WANTS TO 
GET IT DONE. I 
MAY BE WRONG. I 
HEARD SOMEBODY ON A CERTAIN 
NETWORK, AND I WON'T MENTION, 
WHY HAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
GIVEN SO MUCH TO NORTH KOREA? I 
SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. 
I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE TO CALL 
THIS PERSON. I 
GAVE THEM NOTHING OTHER THEN I 
MET THEM. 
WHAT DID I GIVE THEM? I 
DIDN'T DO WHAT OBAMA DID, GIVING
THEM $1.8 BILLION IN CASH TO GET
BACK FOUR HOSTAGES. I 
GOT BACK OUR HOSTAGES AND I 
NEVER PAID THEM 10 CENTS. 
HE WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL AND 
THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A DEAL. 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP, A LOT DIFFERENT 
THAN THE LAST TIME AT THE 
UNITED NATIONS. 
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT ROUGH. 
DON'T FORGET THAT AT THAT TIME, 
THEY SAID TRUMP IS SAYING 
HORRIBLE THINGS AND WILL GET US 
INTO A WAR. 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A WAR IF 
I WAS AN ELECTED. 
YOU'D BE IN A WAR AND PRESIDENT 
OBAMA ESSENTIALLY SAID THE SAME 
THING. 
HE WAS READY TO GO TO WAR. 
YOU WOULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS, 
NOT THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE. 
SEOUL, KOREA, HAS 30 MILLION 
PEOPLE 40 MILES AND 30 MILES 
FROM THIS VERY DANGEROUS 
BORDER. 
IF IT WASN'T ELECTED, YOU 
WOULD'VE HAD A WAR. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA THOUGHT YOU HAD 
TO GET A WAR. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE HE WAS 
TOO PRESSING THE TRIGGER? 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN WITH ME, 
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THAT. 
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
HE LIKES ME, I LIKE HIM AND WE 
GET ALONG. 
HE WROTE ME TWO OF THE MOST 
BEAUTIFUL LETTERS. 
WHEN I SHOWED ONE OF THE 
LETTERS, JUST ONE, TO PRIME 
MINISTER SHINZO ABE, HE SAID 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A 
GROUNDBREAKING LETTER, AND 
INCREDIBLE AND HISTORIC LETTER. 
IT IS HISTORIC. 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART. I
THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 
DEAL. 
WILL WE MAKE A DEAL, STEVE? I 
DON'T REALLY KNOW. I 
THINK WE ARE GOING TO AND IN THE
MEANTIME, I DON'T WANT TO BORE 
YOU, NO ROCKETS, NO MISSILES, 
NO NUCLEAR TESTS. 
FOR OVER A YEAR WHERE YOU 
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. 
BEFORE I GOT HERE, EVERYBODY IN 
THIS ROOM THOUGHT YOU WERE 
GOING TO WAR. 
WHAT HAPPENED, IT WAS FUNNY. 
THEY SAID, HE WAS TERRIBLE, SO 
ROUGH WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, KIM 
JONG-UN. 
SO ROUGH. 
WELL, I HAD A GREAT MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN AND ON 
THAT WHEN THEY SAID, HE WAS TOO 
SOFT WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN. I 
HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH PUTIN. 
IT LASTED FOR TWO HOURS. 
WE DISCUSSED EVERYTHING, 
UKRAINE, SERIAL, -- SYRIA, WE 
HAD A GREAT MEETING. 
THEY WANTED ME TO END UP IN A 
BOXING MATCH AND IF I WAS 
KILLER TOUGH WITH PUTIN HE 
WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS TOO 
TOUGH. 
YOU CAN'T WIN WITH THESE PEOPLE 
BUT YOU JUST KEEP GOING AND IN 
THE MEANTIME, WE ARE DOING 
WELL. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> HOW LONG SHOULD IT TAKE 
NORTH KOREA TO DENUCLEARIZE? 
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE 
TIME. 
DO YOU KNOW WHY? 
I SAID MIKE POMPEO, DON'T GET 
INTO THE TIME GAME. 
WE STOP THEM AND THEY ARE 
TAKING DOWN PLANTS AND A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT TESTING AREAS AND 
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE DOWN 
MORE AND YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT 
THAT SOON. 
I DON'T WANT TO GO AHEAD OF 
MYSELF BUT YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT 
IT SOON. 
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST RIGHT NOW 
IN TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
WE HAD A CASE WHEN I WAS COMING 
INTO OFFICE THAT YOU REMEMBER 
WHERE THERE WAS A MASSIVE THING 
THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS AN 
EARTHQUAKE. A MOUNTAIN MOVED 
OVER 1.5 INCHES. 
NORTH KOREA'S BEAUTIFUL LAND 
AND THIS MOUNTAIN ACTUALLY 
SHIFTED. 
IT SHIFTED AND SOMEBODY THOUGHT 
IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE AND THEN 
THEY FOUND OUT IT WAS NUCLEAR 
TESTING. 
SHIFTED A MOUNTAIN. 
SERIOUS STUFF, SERIOUS SIZE. 
WHEN I CAME IN AND BEFORE I 
CAME, AND EVEN AT THE BEGINNING 
OF MINE BECAUSE I WAS HAVING 
RHETORICAL CONTESTS, REALLY, 
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND WE BOTH 
SMILE NOW AND LAUGH AT NOW, BUT 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS A 
HORRIBLE THING. 
WE'VE HAD MANY PRESIDENTS THAT 
WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING, 
ANYTHING AT ALL WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
WE NOW HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND 
MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL OF THE 
THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING 
ABOUT THE HORROR STORIES, IN MY 
OPINION, THEY ARE GONE. 
COULD THEY START UP AGAIN, I 
GUESS. 
I'M A DEAL GUY. 
COULD THEY? 
YEAH. 
WE COULD WORK IT OUT. 
RIGHT HERE, I THINK THAT WHAT 
WE'VE DONE BEHIND THE SCENES 
THAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS AND I 
DON'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT 
KNOWING, PERSONAL LETTERS AND 
PRIVATE LETTERS, BUT SAYING 
THEY WANT TO GET IT DONE. 
WE KNOW MUCH MORE THAN THE 
MEDIA, FOR CHANGE, MUCH MORE. 
IF YOU SO WHAT'S GOING ON 
BEHIND THE SCENES I THINK YOU 
WOULD BE VERY IMPRESSED. 
WE WERE A COUNTRY GOING TO WAR 
AND I REALLY BELIEVE PRESIDENT 
OBAMA WOULD. 
HE SAID IT WAS HIS BIGGEST 
PROBLEM AND WHEN I SAT WITH HIM 
PRIOR BEFORE GOING INTO OFFICE, 
HE SAID TO ME, THAT'S BY FAR 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AND HE SAID 
HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO GOING INTO 
WAR. 
AND, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE -- THEY 
SAY THOUSANDS -- NOT THOUSANDS. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN KILLED AND THAT WOULD BE 
RIGHT NEXT TO CHINA AND IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN A WORLD WAR 
VERY EASILY. 
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE IN A GREAT 
POSITION AND I DON'T WANT TO 
PLAY THE TIME GAME. I 
TOLD MIKE POMPEO, DON'T LET 
THEM DO THAT TO YOU. I 
HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING AND WE 
GOT BACK A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE 
WERE BACK 2.5 MONTHS FROM THE 
SUMMIT, WHICH WAS A GREAT 
SUCCESS AND PEOPLE ARE 
SCREAMING, WHAT'S TAKING SO 
LONG? I 
SAID, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 
THE MEDIA. 
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE 
MEDIA ALL MY LIFE, TOO MUCH. 
THEY WERE SCREAMING AND I SAW 
THAT AND OUR GUYS WERE WORKING 
AND I SAID, I'VE GOT ALL THE 
TIME IN THE WORLD. 
I DON'T HAVE TO RUSH IT. 
THERE'S NO CESSATION OF 
SANCTIONS. 
WE'VE GOT THE SECTIONS ON. 
I DIDN'T TAKE SANCTIONS OFF. I 
DID SEE A REPORTER THAT I LIKE 
A LOT AND HE ASKED A QUESTION 
TO PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH 
KOREA. 
HE SAID, WHY DID THE PRESIDENT 
GIVES SO MUCH? I 
DIDN'T GIVE ANYTHING. 
I GAVE NOTHING. 
WHAT HAVE I GIVEN OTHER THAN 
TIME? 
YES, I FLEW TO SINGAPORE AND WE 
HAD A MEETING. 
NOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO -- IF YOU 
ASK GENERAL MATTA'S 4-YEAR AND 
A HALF I SAID WHY DON'T WE STOP 
THESE RIDICULOUS, AND MY 
OPINION, THE MILITARY GAMES. I 
CALL THEM THE MILITARY GAMES. 
IF I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH THOSE 
GAMES BECAUSE -- AND FRANKLY I 
TOLD SOUTH KOREA HE SHOULD BE 
PAYING FOR THESE GAMES. 
THEY SAY, WE FLY THE AIRPLANES 
AND FROM A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY 
AND IT WAS FROM deGROM -- IT 
WAS FROM GUAM. 
WE FLY THESE MASSIVE BOMBERS 
AND I WANTED TO STOP THIS A 
LONG TIME. 
BY THE WAY, WE ARE SAVING A 
FORTUNE FOR THE TAXPAYERS AND 
IF WE NEED THEM WE CAN SET THEM 
UP IMMEDIATELY. 
IF I THINK WE NEED THEM, I WILL 
START THEM BEFORE THE GENERALS 
WILL START THEM. 
THE FACT THAT THIS REPORTER SAID
THAT, I SAID, WHAT HAVE I DONE, 
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING. 
WE ARE ON TO THE CUSP. 
WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING 
VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE ARE NOT 
PLAYING THE TIME GAME. 
IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS, THREE 
YEARS OR FIVE MONTHS, IT 
DOESN'T MATTER. 
THERE IS NO NUCLEAR TESTING AND 
THERE'S NO TESTING OF ROCKETS. 
GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 
>> THIS IS THE ONE THAT WAS 
NODDING WITH EVERY NICE THING. 
WATCH THIS QUESTION. 
>> IT'S A HABIT OF MINE. 
I'M FROM SKY NEWS. 
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 
PURCHASE. 
>> NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. 
>> I HOPE YOU BENEFITED. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED AT 
THE MESSAGE THAT IS BEING SENT 
TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE WATCHING 
THIS, WHEN YOU USE LANGUAGE 
LIKE CON JOB IN RELATION TO 
ALLEGATIONS. 
>> I'VE USED MUCH WORSE 
LANGUAGE THAN CON JOB. 
IT'S PROBABLY THE NICEST PHRASE 
OF USE. 
IT IS. 
IT IS A CON JOB. 
NO CONFIDENCE. 
IT IS A CON JOB BY THE 
DEMOCRATS AND THEY KNOW IT. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE -- >> 
THEY DID THE SAME THING WITH 
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. 
THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE 
THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH 
RUSSIA. 
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. 
THINK OF IT. 
I'M IN WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN AND 
I SAY, WE ARE NOT DOING WELL. 
I WON BOTH THOSE STATES AND WE 
ARE NOT DOING WELL. 
LET ME CALL THE RUSSIANS TO 
HELP. 
DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE 
THAT? 
IT'S A CON JOB. I 
WATCHED THESE GUYS AND THERE 
WAS A CALL FROM A RUSSIAN WHO 
TURNED OUT TO BE A FAKER, A 
COMEDIAN OR SOMETHING. 
THIS IS SO-AND-SO. 
WHY DID HE TAKE A CALL FROM A 
RUSSIAN? 
SENATOR WARNER TOOK A CALL FROM 
A RUSSIAN? 
HE WAS A COMEDIAN OR SOMETHING 
BUT HE SAID WE HAVE PICTURES OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
WHERE CAN I GET THEM? 
IF WE EVER DID THAT IT WOULD BE 
A BIG DEAL. 
IT'S A CON JOB AND NOT A BAD 
TERM, NOT A BAD TERM AT ALL. I 
TELL YOU ONE THING I CAN SAY. 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE 
TALKING ABOUT THIS TO ME WITH 
RESPECT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING 
BECAUSE IT'S A HORRIBLE 
PRECEDENT. 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET OTHER 
JUDGES AND OTHER SUPREME COURT 
JUDGES, POSSIBLY. 
I COULD HAVE A LOT OF SUPREME 
COURT JUDGES, MORE THAN TWO AND 
WHEN I CALLED UP BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND SPOKE TO HIM AND 
HIS FAMILY AND TOLD THEM THAT I 
CHOSE THEM, THEY WERE SO HAPPY 
AND SO HONORED. úIT WAS AS THOU 
BIGGEST THING THAT EVER 
HAPPENED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, 
U.S. SUPREME COURT. I 
DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION 
WHERE PEOPLE SAY, NO THANKS, NO 
THANKS. 
I SPOKE TO SOMEBODY 38 YEARS AGO
AND IT MAY NOT BE GOOD. 
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN. 
WE WANT THE BEST TALENT IN THE 
WORLD. 
BUT I TELL YOU THIS, THE PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE COMPLAINED TO ME 
ABOUT IT THE MOST ABOUT WHAT'S 
HAPPENING ARE WOMEN. 
WOMEN ARE VERY ANGRY. 
I'VE GOT 52% WITH WOMEN AND 
EVERYONE SAID THIS COULDN'T 
HAPPEN. 
52%. 
WOMEN ARE SO ANGRY. 
FRANKLY, I THINK THAT THEY LIKE 
WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING. 
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED 
TO SEE IT GO A LOT FASTER. 
GIVE THEM THEIR DAY IN COURT 
AND LET HER HAVE HER DAY IN 
COURT AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE 
HAVE A DAY IN COURT. 
BUT I HAVE MEN THAT DON'T LIKE 
IT. 
I HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE INCENSED 
AT WHAT'S GOING ON. 
I'VE ALWAYS SAID WOMEN ARE 
SMARTER THAN MEN. 
I'VE SAID THAT A LOT AND I MEAN 
IT. 
WOMEN ARE INCENSED AT WHAT IS 
GOING ON. 
>> WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE ARE 
YOU FROM? 
YEAH, YOU. 
GUY LOOKS LIKE HE'S SHOCKED. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE NOT GOOD. 
THE GUY LOOKS TOTALLY STUNNED. 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PICKED 
BEFORE FOR QUESTION? 
>> YES, SIR. 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU 
ALWAYS TALK ABOUT -- YOU SAID 
FROM WHERE? 
>> FROM NORTH OF IRAQ. 
I'M KURDISH. 
>> GOOD. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
>> THANK YOU, SIR. 
>> GREAT PEOPLE. 
THANK YOU. 
ARE YOU CURTIS? 
GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT FIGHTERS. I 
LIKE THEM A LOT. 
LET'S GO. 
I LIKE THIS QUESTION SO FAR. 
>> YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU SUPPORT 
YOUR ALLIES BUT KURDISH PEOPLE 
ARE UNDER PRESSURE IN SYRIA AND 
IRAQ BY MANY ADVERSARIES. 
>> IT'S TRUE. 
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ELEVATE 
THE POSITION TO SUPPORT THEM IF 
THEY HELP THE U.S. TO DEFEAT 
ISIS. 
>> WE ARE HELPING THEM A LOT 
AND WE'VE BEEN VERY FRIENDLY. 
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE FOUGHT SIDE-
BY-SIDE AND WE HAVE DEFEATED 
ISIS, ESSENTIALLY, SHORT WHILE 
AGO IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND WE 
DID IT WITH A LOT OF HELP FROM 
THE KURDS. 
THEY ARE GREAT FIGHTERS. 
SOME ARE GREAT FIGHTERS AND 
SOME AREN'T. 
THE KURDS ARE GREAT FIGHTERS 
AND GREAT PEOPLE. 
WE ARE DISCUSSING THAT 
SITUATION RIGHT NOW. 
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO SUIT TO 
SUPPORT THIS? 
>> I'M TELLING YOU WE HAVE 
ALREADY STARTED DISCUSSING THAT 
SITUATION. 
WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT 
FROM THE KURDS AND DEFEATING 
ISIS. 
>> ABOUT SYRIA? 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, SUSAN LEE 
FROM FOXBUSINESS. 
DID YOU REJECT A ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING WITH THE CANADIAN PRIME 
MINISTER, JUSTIN TRUDEAU? 
>> YEAH, I DID. 
>> WHY? 
>> IS TARIFFS ARE TOO HIGH AND 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO MOVE AND I 
TOLD HIM FORGET ABOUT IT. 
WE ARE THINKING OF TAXING CARS 
COMING IN FROM CANADA, THAT IS 
THE MOTHER LODE, THE BIG ONE. 
WE ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE 
NEGOTIATIONS AND THE NEGOTIATING
STYLE OF CANADA. 
WE DON'T LIKE THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVE VERY MUCH. 
I LOVE CANADA, BY THE WAY. 
I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS, I LOVE 
EVERYBODY. 
SO MANY FRIENDS BUT THAT HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. 
I'M REPRESENTING THE UNITED 
STATES. 
MEXICO WAS TOTALLY GREAT. 
BY THE WAY, THE NEW PRESIDENT 
HAS BEEN GREAT. 
THE DEAL IS DONE. 
NOW, HAS TO GO THROUGH CONGRESS 
AND A LOT OF THINGS HAVE TO 
HAPPEN BUT BOB LIGHT HAUSER, 
WHO IS HERE SOMEPLACE -- HE HAS 
DONE A GREAT JOB OF 
NEGOTIATING, AS THEY HAVE. 
THE DEAL IS DONE FOR CONGRESS. 
CANADA HAS TREATED US VERY 
BADLY. 
THEY'VE TREATED OUR FARMERS IN 
WISCONSIN AND NEW YORK STATE 
AND OTHER STATES VERY BADLY. 
DAIRY PRODUCTS, 300%, 300%. 
HOW DO SALLY -- HOW DO YOU SELL 
DAIRY PRODUCTS AT 300%? 
IT IS A BARRIER. 
BY THE WAY, 300% BECAUSE YOU 
CAN COMPETE. 
CANADA HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. 
WE ARE NOT GETTING ALONG WITH 
THEIR NEGOTIATORS. 
WE THINK THEY HAVE TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT OVER THE 
LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS, WE HAD 
$800 BILLION A YEAR IN TRADE 
LOSSES. 
IT'S RIDICULOUS AND IT WON'T 
HAPPEN. 
>> WHAT ABOUT NAFTA? 
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT DOES THAT 
MEAN FOR NAFTA? 
WILL YOU BE PULLING OUT OF 
NAFTA? 
>> I DON'T LIKE NAFTA. 
I NEVER LIKED IT. 
IT'S BEEN VERY BAD FOR THE 
UNITED STATES. 
GREAT FOR CANADA AND MEXICO. I 
WON'T USE THE NAME NAFTA. I 
REFUSE TO USE IT. 
I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PLANTS 
AND FACTORIES CLOSE AND 
MILLIONS OF JOBS LOST TO OIL 
COMPANIES AND MEXICO IS 25% OF 
OUR AUTO BUSINESS BECAUSEOF 
NAFTA. 
UNDER OUR DEAL IT WON'T HAPPEN 
ANYMORE. 
I HATE TO TELL YOU IT'S NOT. 
WE WILL KEEP COMPANIES AND I 
TOLD THE MEXICANS WE HAVE TO 
KEEP COMPANIES. THEY ARE 
GETTING A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. 
MEXICO MADE A VERY GOOD DEAL. 
WITH CANADA, IT'S VERY TOUGH. 
WHAT WE ARE DOING, IF WE MADE A 
DEAL WITH CANADA, WHICH IS A 
GOOD CHANCE, BUT I'M NOT MAKING 
ANYTHING NEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO 
DO. 
>> YOU WILL NOTIFY CONGRESS? 
>> WE WILL PROBABLY CALL IT THE 
U.S. MC, LIKE THE UNITED STATES 
MARINE CORPS, WHICH I LOVE IN 
GENERAL KELLY LIKES IT EVEN 
MORE. 
WHERE IS GENERAL KELLY? 
HE LIKES THAT. 
IT WOULD BE PROBABLY JUST USM, 
UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. 
IF CANADA DOESN'T MAKE A DEAL 
WITH US, WE WILL MAKE A BETTER 
DEAL AND WE WILL TAX THE CARS 
THAT COME IN AND PUT BILLIONS 
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO 
OUR TREASURY AND FRANKLY WE 
WILL BE HAPPY BECAUSE IT'S 
ACTUALLY MORE MONEY THAN YOU 
CAN MAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE 
WITH MAKING A DEAL. 
GOOD JOB. 
VERY GOOD JOB. 
YES PLEASE, MR. KURD. 
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
TWO QUICK QUESTIONS. 
WHAT WILL BE THE USA RELATIONS 
WITH THE KURDS? 
POST ISIS. 
>> WE ARE TRYING TO GET ALONG 
VERY WELL. 
WE DO GET ALONG GREAT WITH THE 
KURDS. 
DON'T FORGET THAT IS THEIR 
TERRITORY AND WE HAVE TO HELP 
THEM. 
I WANT TO HELP THEM. 
THEY FOUGHT WITH US AND DIED 
WITH US. 
WE LOST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
KURDS DIED FIGHTING ISIS. 
THEY DIED FOR US AND WITH US 
AND FOR THEMSELVES. 
THEY DIED FOR THEMSELVES BUT 
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE AND WE 
DON'T FORGET. 
I DON'T FORGET. 
I CAN TELL YOU I DON'TFORGET. 
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, ONE QUESTION 
ABOUT IRAN. 
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO STOP A 
RAINING INFLUENCE IN IRAQ AND 
SYRIA AND -- 
>> I THINK I MUST TELL YOU, I 
DON'T MIND YOUR QUESTIONS. 
I THINK THERE'S BEEN NO GREATER 
CHANGE OTHER THAN MAYBE CHINA 
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY, THE 
MARKETS HAVE DROPPED 30% IN THE 
LAST FOUR MONTHS, RIGHT? 
I THINK I WATCHED YOU WHEN YOU 
SAID THAT. 
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY 32%. 
THEIRS BEEN THAT. 
BUT EVEN THAT -- BECAUSE CHINA 
IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE. 
AND IRAN IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PLACE BUT I THINK THERE'S BEEN 
NO COUNTRY THAT HAS CHANGED SO 
MUCH AS IRAN. 
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, SINCE I 
TOOK OFF THE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, ONE OF THE 
DUMBEST DEALS EVER MADE, AND AS 
AN EXAMPLE, WHY DIDN'T THEY 
TAKE CARE OF YEMEN AND SYRIA IN 
THE DEAL? 
BOB CAREY SAID IT WAS TOO 
COMPLICATED. 
WE ARE GIVING $150 BILLION AND 
WE PAID $1.8 BILLION IN CASH, 
CASH! 
THIS WHOLE ROOM WOULD BE FILLED 
UP WITH 100-DOLLAR BILLS AND 
INDEED, PROBABLY FIVE ROOMS 
LIKE THIS. 
WE GET $1.8 BILLION IN CASH AND 
WHY DIDN'T WE TAKE CARE OF 
YEMEN AND SYRIA? 
HE SAID IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED. 
YOU JUST GAVE THEM $150 BILLION 
AND NOW YEMEN IS A MESS. 
BUT, IT'S GETTING BETTER. 
SYRIA IS A MESS. I WAS 
RESPONSIBLE AND I HOPE IT STAYS 
THAT WAY WHEN I PUT ON ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA, IF YOU WEEKS AGO, 
ABOUT IDLIB PROVINCE. 
I SAID, DON'T DO IT. 
I WILL TELL YOU, IT HAPPENED 
WHERE I WAS AT A MEETING WITH 
THE LOT OF SUPPORTERS AND A 
WOMAN STOOD UP AND SAID, THERE 
IS A PROVINCE IN SYRIA WITH 3 
MILLION PEOPLE IN RIGHT NOW THE 
IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS AND 
SYRIANS ARE SURROUNDING THAT 
PROVINCE AND THEY ARE GOING TO 
KILL MY SISTER AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO KILL MILLIONS IN ORDER 
TO GET RID OF 25,000 OR 35,000 
TERRORISTS OR ENEMIES OF 
THEIRS. 
I THINK WE CAN CALL THEM 
TERRORISTS. 
I SAID, THAT'S NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
I DIDN'T HEAR OF IDLIB PROVINCE 
AND I CAME BACK TO NEW YORK. I 
PICKED UP THE FAILING NEW YORK 
TIMES. 
I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT IT WAS 
THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES AND 
I OPENED IT UP. 
THERE WAS A VERY BIG STORY NOT 
ON THE FRONT PAGE AND I SAID 
IT'S THE SAME STORY THAT THE 
WOMAN TOLD ME. 
I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 
HOW COULD ANYBODY DO THAT WITH 
3 MILLION PEOPLE AND IT SAID 
THEY WERE BEING SURROUNDED AND 
THEY WERE GOING IN AND STARTING 
LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY TO DROP 
BOMBS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND 
PERHAPS KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
IN ORDER TO GET 35,000 
TERRORISTS. I 
PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND 
ELSEWHERE AND GAVE MIKE POMPEO 
AND JOHN BOLTON AND EVERYBODY 
THESE ORDERS. 
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN. 
I SAID DON'T LET IT HAPPEN. 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE 
SELECTIVE THAT THEY CAN'T GO 
IN. 
THEY WILL DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO 
DO WITH TERRORISTS, BUT DON'T 
KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. 
IT STOPPED. 
YOU SAW THAT. 
NOBODY'S GOING TO GIVE ME 
CREDIT, BUT THAT'S OKAY. 
THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE 
KNOW. 
I'VE HAD MORE SYRIANS THANK ME 
FOR THAT. 
THIS WAS ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO I 
PUT THAT OUT. 
I SAID THEY ARE SURROUNDING A 
CITY OF 3 MILLION PEOPLE AND 
THEY ARE GOING TO START BOMBING 
THE CITY. 
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN. 
AND, I MEANT IT, TOO. I 
MEANT IT. 
MILLIONS HAVE BEEN SAVED AND 
TODAY, I GAVE GREAT CREDIT TO 
IRAN. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD THAT. 
I GAVE GREAT CREDIT TO IRAN AND 
TO RUSSIA AND TO SYRIA FOR NOT 
DOING IT. 
NOW, I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE 
SURGICAL. 
MEANING, GO IN AND DO IT. 
IT'S LENGTHY AND EVERYTHING 
ELSE. 
THEY POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO IT. 
BUT, I THINK MILLIONS WOULD 
HAVE BEEN KILLED AND THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A SHAME. 
HOPEFULLY -- AND I HAVE TO TELL 
YOU, TURKEY HAS BEEN A BIG 
HELP. 
TURKEY HAS BEEN GREAT. 
TURKEY HELPED US WITH THAT WHOLE
SITUATION. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
TOUCHING BACK ON BACK ON IRAN, 
OF COURSE THIS WEEK YOU PUT OUT 
A CALL TO ACTION TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO RALLY WITH AMERICA 
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IRAN. 
ROUHANI STILL CALLING FOR THE 
U.S. TO COME BACK TO THE OLD 
DEAL. 
AFTER MEETING WITH WORLD 
LEADERS DID YOU MAKE ANY 
PROGRESS TOWARD A POTENTIAL NEW 
DEAL? 
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WORLD 
LEADERS THINK ON IRAN. 
IRAN IS COMING BACK TO ME AND 
THEY WILL MAKE A BIG DEAL. I 
THINK, MAYBE NOT. 
DEAL, YOU NEVER KNOW. 
THEY ARE SUFFERING GREATLY. 
THEY'RE HAVING RIOTS IN EVERY 
CITY. 
FAR GREATER THAN THEY WERE 
DURING THE GREEN PERIOD WITH 
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
FAR GREATER WHEN PRESIDENT 
OBAMA STUCK UP FOR GOVERNMENT, 
NOT THE PEOPLE. 
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD A 
MUCH DIFFERENT IRAN HAD HE NOT 
DONE THAT BUT I'M STICKING UP 
FOR THE PEOPLE. 
I AM WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAN. 
HERE'S THE THING. 
THEY HAVE RAMPANT INFLATION. 
THEIR MONEY IS THIS -- THEIR 
MONEY IS WORTHLESS. 
YOU CAN'T BUY BREAD, YOU CAN'T 
DO ANYTHING. 
IT'S A DISASTER. 
I THINK THEY WILL WANT TO COME 
BACK AND SAY, CAN WE DO 
SOMETHING? 
VERY SIMPLE, I JUST DON'T WANT 
THEM TO HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? 
I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I 
WANT THEM TO HAVE A GREAT 
ECONOMY AND SELL SO MUCH OIL. 
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH OPEC AND I 
TOLD THEM, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH 
OPEC. 
WE TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE 
AND DEFEND THEM AND THEY 
WOULDN'T BE THERE FOR TWO WEEKS 
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME AND THE 
U.S. AND A MUCH STRONGER ARMED 
FORCES THAN IT WAS. 
OUR ARMED FORCES WERE DEPLETED. 
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY, 
$700,000,000,000.716 BILLION, 
THE MOST INCREDIBLE NEW JETS 
AND EVERYTHING. 
WE NEED IT. 
NOT THAT I WANT TO SPEND IT, 
ALTHOUGH IT IS JOBS AND ALL 
MADE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
IRAN HAS TO COME BACK AND THEY 
HAVE TO TALK. 
I'M NOT DOING THIS FROM 
STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS. 
I'M JUST SAYING, AT SOME POINT, 
THEY HAVE TO COME BACK. 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON,
COMPANIES ARE LEAVING LEFT AND 
RIGHT. 
MERCEDES BENZ JUST LEFT. 
THEY ARE ALL LEAVING. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN IRAN 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CHOICE. 
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH IRAN OR 
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH US? 
WE PICKED UP $10 TRILLION SINCE 
MY ELECTION. 
WERE BEING CAUGHT BY CHINA AND 
NOW IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY. 
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THIS 
SITUATION WITH CHINA. 
CHINA IS SO GREAT, FOR 20 
YEARS, CHINA IS SO GREAT AND 
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 
ANYMORE. 
I LOVE CHINA AND I THINK THEY 
ARE GREAT. 
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 
ANYMORE. 
DO YOU KNOW WHO IS GREAT? 
WE ARE GREAT. 
JUST A COUPLE MORE. I 
COULD DO THIS ALL DAY LONG. 
I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY LONG. 
SHOULD BE CONTINUED FOR A 
LITTLE WHILE? 
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. 
A COUPLE OF MORE, I DON'T CARE. 
NEW YORK TIMES, THE FAILING NEW 
YORK TIMES, STAND UP. 
GO AHEAD. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TIMES IS 
FAILING. 
YOU ARE FAR FROM FAILING. 
>> YOU WERE POINTING AT ME. 
>> THE TIMES ARE VERY 
INTERESTING. 
THE TIMES, I THINK THEY ARE 
GOING TO ENDORSE ME. 
I THINK ABC AND FOX -- I LIKE 
FOX -- I REALLY DO. 
ABC, CBS, NBC, THEY ALL WILL 
ENDORSE ME BECAUSE IF THEY 
DON'T, THEY ARE GOING OUT OF 
BUSINESS. 
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T 
HAVE ME? 
>> I KNOW YOU ARE POINTING FOR 
ME BUT I WORK FOR PBS NEWS. 
>> I KNOW THAT. 
>> YESTERDAY, YOU WERE TALKING 
ABOUT YOUR ADMINISTRATION'S 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AT THE UNITED 
NATIONS AND A LOT OF THE 
LEADERS LAUGHED. 
>> THAT WAS FAKE NEWS. 
THAT'S FAKE NEWS AND I KNOW 
WHAT WAS COVERED THAT WAY. 
I SAID THAT SINCE MY ELECTION, 
OUR ECONOMY HAS BECOME THE 
HOTTEST IN THE WORLD. 
TAX REDUCTIONS, REGULATIONS, 
CONFIDENCE LEVELS ARE THE 
HIGHEST IN 18 YEARS, REALLY 
SOON TO BE HISTORIC. 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE LOWEST IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
YOU LOOK AT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT, 
ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT AND YOU LOOK 
AT WOMEN, 65 YEARS, THE 
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ON THE 
AMONG THE BEST WE EVER HAD, 
EVER. 
THE NUMBERS OF NEW COMPANIES 
POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY, WHICH 
NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. 
I SAID THIS AND I WAS IN FRONT 
OF A LARGE GROUP OF HIGHLY 
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE. 
MOST OF THEM ARE FROM OTHER 
COUNTRIES OR THE UNITED 
NATIONS, PEOPLE NOT BIG INTO 
CLAPPING AND APPLAUDING AND 
SMILING. I 
HEARD A LITTLE RUSSELL, AND I 
SAID OUR COUNTRY IS NOW 
STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE AND 
IT'S TRUE. I 
HEARD A LITTLE RUSSELL AND I 
SAID, IT'S TRUE AND IT HURTS 
MILES AND I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT -- THEY WEREN'T LAUGHING 
AT ME, THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH 
ME. 
WE HAD FUN. 
THAT WAS NOT LAUGHING AT ME. 
FAKE NEWS SAID PEOPLE LAUGHED 
AT PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
THEY DIDN'T LAUGH AT ME. 
PEOPLE HAD A GOOD TIME WITH ME. 
WE WERE DOING IT TOGETHER. 
WE HAD A GOOD TIME. 
THEY RESPECT WHAT I'VE DONE. 
THE UNITED STATES IS RESPECTED 
AGAIN. 
THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT 
RESPECTED. 
EVERYBODY WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE 
OF US FROM JOBS AND TAKING OUR 
COMPANIES AND NOT PAYING THE 
PRICE TO SO MANY OTHER THINGS. 
EVEN MILITARY PROTECTION. 
I TOLD A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, I SAID, 
LISTEN, YOU ARE A VERY RICH 
COUNTRY AND WE PROTECT YOU. 
WITHOUT OUR PROTECTION, YOU 
WOULD HAVE REAL PROBLEMS. 
YOU WOULD HAVE REAL PROBLEMS. 
I SAID, YOU SHOULD REIMBURSE US 
FOR THIS PROTECTION. 
WHY ARE WE PROTECTING YOU? 
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY 
SAID? 
AFTER TWO MINUTES OF TALKING? 
THEY AGREED WITH ME. 
YOU CAN ASK THIS GROUP OF VERY 
TALENTED PEOPLE. 
THEY AGREED WITH ME. 
THEY SAID -- ONE OF THEM SAID 
-- MR. PRESIDENT, NOBODY EVER 
ASKED US US. 
THEY NEVER ASKED US FOR THAT. 
NOBODY EVER SAID YOU SHOULD 
PAY. 
THESE ARE REALLY WEALTHY 
COUNTRIES. 
I WILL BE HONEST, I JUST ASKED 
JAPAN. 
I SAID, WE ARE DEFENDING YOU, 
VERY WEALTHY COUNTRY. 
YOU SEND US MILLIONS OF CARS 
AND YOU MAKE A FORTUNE AND WE 
HAVE A TREMENDOUS TRADE DEFICIT 
WITH YOU AND WE ARE DEFENDING 
YOU AND SUBSIDIZING YOUR 
MILITARY WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT 
OF MONEY. 
I SAID IT TO SOUTH KOREA. 
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS IN 
SOUTH KOREA. 
THEY ARE VERY WEALTHY AND THESE 
ARE GREAT COUNTRIES, VERY 
WEALTHY COUNTRIES. I 
SAID, WHY AREN'T YOU 
REIMBURSING US FOR OUR COSTS? 
THEY LOOKED AT ME AND THEY 
CAN'T EVEN ANSWER BECAUSE THERE 
IS NO ANSWER. 
IF THEY WERE A POOR COUNTRY AND 
THEY NEED PROTECTION AND PEOPLE 
WERE GOING TO DIE, I'M ALL FOR 
PROTECTING THEM AND I DON'T 
WANT 10 CENTS. 
WHEN WEALTHY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE
MASSIVE TRADE SURPLUSES WITH 
US, MASSIVE -- AND THEN ON TOP 
OF THAT, WE ARE PAYING FOR 
THEIR MILITARY OR PAYING FOR 
LOT OF THEIR MILITAR? 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, REALLY 
QUICKLY, YOU SAID YOU FEEL A 
KINSHIP. 
YOU SAID YOU FEEL A KINSHIP 
WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
REALLY QUICKLY, YOU SAID YOU 
FELT A KINSHIP WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND THAT YOUR FALSE 
ALLEGATIONS YOU FEEL LIKE WERE 
MADE AGAINST YOU MAKE YOU FEEL 
LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE 
THESE WOMEN. 
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT. 
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? 
FAKE NEWS. 
DID I SAY THAT? 
EXCUSE ME. 
BY THE WAY, I THINK YOU DO A 
GOOD JOB BUT I DIDN'T SAY THAT. 
I DO WATCH YOU AND I THINK YOU 
DO A GOOD JOB. 
I SAID I LOOK FORWARD TO 
WATCHING HER. 
I DO WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS 
AND MAYBE SHE WILL SAY -- I 
COULD BE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING. 
MAYBE SHE WILL SAY SOMETHING 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE TO 
TELL YOU HE IS ONE OF THE 
HIGHEST QUALITY HUMAN BEINGS. 
HE IS A TREMENDOUS MAN, A 
TREMENDOUS GENIUS, A GREAT 
INTELLECT. I 
BELIEVE HE WAS NUMBER ONE AT 
YALE. 
IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT? 
HE WAS A GREAT STUDENT IN LAW 
AND I'VE HEARD HIS NAME -- I 
DIDN'T KNOW HIM -- DIDN'T KNOW 
HIM UNTIL THIS WHOLE THING, BUT 
I'VE HEARD HIS NAME FOR 10 
YEARS. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW I HEARD HIS 
NAME? 
EVERYBODY SAID HE SHOULD BE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT AND I SAID, 
WHO IS HE? 
THEY SAID HIS NAME WAS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND HE'S THE MOST 
BRILLIANT PERSON, THE MOST 
BRILLIANT LAWYER. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT HIM ON THE 
SUPREME COURT 10 YEARS AGO. 
WITH ALL OF THAT, I WANT TO 
HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. 
>> YOU SAID YOU FEEL LIKE THERE 
HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS FALSE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST YOU. 
>> I'VE HAD MANY FALSE 
STATEMENTS AGAINST ME AND IF 
THE PRESS WOULD HAVE REPORTED 
IT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
HAPPY. 
JOHN ROBERTS WILL TELL YOU AND 
YOU COVER THE STORY WHERE WOMEN 
WERE PAID TO SAY BAD THINGS 
ABOUT ME. 
SEAN HANNITY COVERED IT AND I 
WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN I SAW 
THAT ON SEAN HANNITY, I 
ACTUALLY CALLED HIM. 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 
I DON'T SPEAK TO HIM MUCH BUT I 
RESPECT HIM. 
I CALLED HIM AND SAID THIS IS 
THE BIGGEST STORY, A BIG STORY 
AND HE AGREED WITH ME AND THE 
NEXT DAY I PICKED UP THE STORY 
AND THERE WASN'T ONE WORD ABOUT 
IT. 
THE NEXT DAY I WATCHED ABC NEWS 
AND I WATCHED NBC AND I WATCHED 
CBS. I DIDN'T WATCH CNN BUT 
NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO. I 
WATCHED EVERYTHING AND THERE 
WASN'T ONE STORY OTHER THAN 
FOX. 
AND, IT'S A BIG STORY. 
ENOUGH. 
THANK YOU. 
>> IS IT OKAY IF I GIVE IT TO 
THE NEW YORK TIMES, MR. 
PRESIDENT? 
>> THAT'S ENOUGH. 
GOOD JOB. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, CAN YOU ASK A 
QUESTION SINCE I AM BEFORE THE 
NEW YORK TIMES BEFORE THIS 
GENTLEMAN? 
I'M ACTUALLY FROM THE NEW YORK 
TIMES. 
>> I WILL LET YOU DO IT AFTER 
HE DOES, IS THAT OKAY? 
IN HONOR OF A PAPER I ONCE 
LOVED. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I'M WITH TRUE 
NEWS AND TODAY YOU MET WITH 
YAHOO FROM ISRAEL -- YOU MET 
WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU FROM 
ISRAEL. CAN YOU GIVE US A 
PREVIEW OF WHAT THIS GREAT 
DEAL, THE PIECE -- 
>> IN LOVE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH 
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS. 
IT IS A TOUGH DEAL AND I THINK 
HEALTHCARE IS PROBABLY TOUGHER 
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. 
IT IS TOUGH AND WE WILL TAKE 
CARE OF THAT, TOO. 
THAT'S GOING TO GET TAKEN CARE 
OF. 
ALL MY LIFE I'VE HEARD THE DEAL 
BETWEEN, AS YOU KNOW, ISRAEL 
AND THE PALESTINIANS. 
EVERY POSSIBLE THING IS TOUGH 
ABOUT THAT. 
I THINK WE WILL MAKE A DEAL. 
SO, AT ONE OF OUR MANY MEETINGS 
TODAY I WAS WITH BENJAMIN 
NETANYAHU. 
HE'S BEEN EXTREMELY NICE TO ME 
AND VERY HAPPY I DID THE WHOLE 
THING WITH JERUSALEM AND THE 
EMBASSY. 
BY THE WAY, WE'VE GOT IT OPEN 
IN FOUR MONTHS FOR LESS THAN 
$500,000. 
THE BUDGET WAS OVER $1 BILLION, 
RIGHT? 
AND IT'S OPEN AND BEAUTIFUL, BY 
THE WAY. 
AND I WILL TELL YOU, SOMEONE 
SAID IT WAS THE FIRST NEWS 
CONFERENCE IN A LONG TIME AND I 
SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I 
DID FIVE TODAY. 
EVERY TIME I SAID I TAKE 
QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE 
SCREAMING LIKE MANIACS IN THE 
BACK OF THE ROOM, MEANING 
REPORTERS AND ONE OF THEM, AND 
I WON'T SAY WAS JOHN ROBERTS, 
BUT ONE OF THEM -- IT WAS, BUT 
THAT'S OKAY. 
DON'T FEEL GUILTY, JOHN. 
ONE OF THE REPORTERS THAT WAS 
SCREAMING ASKED ABOUT THE ONE 
STATE-2 STATE AND I SAID, I 
THINK THE TWO STATE WILL 
HAPPEN. 
IN ONE WAY IT'S MORE DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE IT'S A REAL ESTATE DEAL 
AND YOU NEED BOUNDARIES AND 
CARVEOUTS AND OTHER THINGS. 
IT'S A TOUGHER DEAL BUT WORKS 
BETTER BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE 
GOVERNING THEMSELVES. 
THEY ASKED ME AND I SAID, I 
THINK THE TWO STATE WILL 
HAPPEN. 
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN 
THE TWO STATE ROAD AND I'M GLAD 
I GOT IT OUT. 
JARED, SO INVOLVED, HE LOVES 
ISRAEL BUT HE'S ALSO GOING TO 
BE FAIR WITH THE PALESTINIANS. 
HE UNDERSTANDS IT TAKES TWO 
GROUPS TO BE HAPPY. 
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE HAPPY AND 
THAT IS WHY IT'S SO TOUGH. 
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH HATRED 
AND ANGER FOR SO MANY YEARS AND 
THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE 
INGREDIENT. 
IF THEY ASKED ME, I THINK WILL 
BE A TWO STATE. 
BY SAYING THAT, I PUT IT OUT 
THERE AND IF YOU ASK MOST IN 
ISRAEL, THEY AGREE WITH THAT 
BUT NOBODY WANTED TO SAY IT. 
IT'S A BIG THING, A VERY BIG 
THING TO PUT IT OUT. 
THE BOTTOM LINE, IF THE 
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS 
WANT ONE STATE, THAT'S OKAY 
WITH ME. 
IF THEY WANT TWO STATES, THAT'S 
OKAY WITH ME. 
I'M HAPPY IF THEY ARE HAPPY. 
I'M A FACILITATOR. 
I WANT A DEAL DONE SO PEOPLE 
DON'T GET KILLED ANYMORE. 
WE HAD A GREAT CONFERENCE IN 
HISTORY AND MANY WERE THERE, 
PROBABLY ALL OF YOU WERE THERE, 
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TWO 
DAYS. 
THAT AND CHINA, TWO OF THE MOST 
INCREDIBLE EVENTS I'VE SEEN. 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
IT AND WE HAD 58 MUSLIM 
COUNTRIES, THE LEADERS, THE 
KINGS AND THE ABSOLUTE LEADERS. 
THERE WAS NOBODY IN SECOND 
PLACE. 
THEY WERE THE LEADERS OF THE 
WHOLE THING. 
UNBEKNOWNST TO ANYBODY ELSE, 
PEOPLE WOULD COME UP AND IT 
WASN'T A SET UP. 
THEY COME UP AND THEY'D SAY, 
SO, YOU CAN'T HAVE PEACE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST WITHOUT PIECE 
BETWEEN THE ISRAELIS AND THE 
PALESTINIANS AND I SAID, WHY 
DOES THAT MATTER SO MUCH? 
THEY SAID, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO 
MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
UNLESS YOU HAVE IT BETWEEN THE 
ISRAELIS. 
I HEARD THAT FROM THE KING OF 
SAUDI ARABIA, A GREAT GUY, KING 
SOLOMON. 
SOMEBODY ELSE CAME UP AND HE 
WASN'T TOLD TO GO SAY THIS. 
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE COMING 
FROM AND I MUST'VE HAD 12 
LEADERS SAY IT AND THEY JUST 
SAID IT AND I STARTED TO REALIZE
THAT PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
THE PALESTINIANS FOR THE MIDDLE 
EAST IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING 
AND WE ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO 
GET IT. 
PROBABLY TWO STATE IS MORE 
LIKELY BUT IF THEY DO A SINGLE 
OR A DOUBLE, I'M OKAY IF THEY 
ARE BOTH HAPPY. 
IF THEY ARE BOTH HAPPY, I'M 
OKAY WITH EITHER. 
I THINK THE TWO STATE IS MORE 
LIKELY. 
>> NEW YORK TIMES? 
>> OKAY. 
>> THANK YOU, SIR. 
>> I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A BAD 
STORY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, 
BUT I WILL ANYWAY. 
I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER. 
THEN, WE WILL CALL IT QUITS. 
>> WE ARE THRIVING, NOT 
FAILING. 
>> YOU ARE DOING VERY WELL. 
SAY THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP. 
>> I WILL STOP SHORT OF THAT. 
>> ALL MY LIFE I'VE HAD VERY 
STEW -- VERY FEW STORIES BUT 
SOME ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
NEW YORK TIMES AND NOW I 
AVERAGE THREE OR FOUR A DAY. 
THEY ARE ALL NEGATIVE, NO 
MATTER WHAT I DO THEY ARE 
NEGATIVE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THAT'S OKAY. I 
STILL OF THE PAPER. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> I WANT TO COME BACK TO 
CHINA. 
WHAT YOU ANNOUNCED TODAY IS 
REALLY IMPORTANT. 
YOU TALK ABOUT THIS FRIENDSHIP 
YOU HAVE WITH XI JINPING AND 
YET, ESSENTIALLY, WHAT YOU DID 
TODAY IS ACCUSED HIS GOVERNMENT 
OF INTERFERING IN OUR INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS, AVERTING THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND DOING IT 
TO HURT YOU, THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY -- >> DOING IT TO HELP 
THEM. 
>> HOW CAN A GUY WHO DOES THAT 
BE YOUR FRIEND? 
>> I THINK THAT WE ARE ABLE TO 
 
WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I 
THINK WE HAD A VERY GOOD 
FRIENDSHIP. 
WE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND 
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. 
THEY ARE DOING STUDIES ON 
DONALD TRUMP TO FIGURE IT ALL 
OUT. 
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO THEM 
BEFORE. 
THINK OF IT. 
YOU'VE COVERED IT VERY WELL. 
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN. 
THEY ARE HAVING BIG PROBLEMS 
AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 
PROBLEMS. 
THEY HAVE TO MAKE A FAIR DEAL 
JUST LIKE CANADA HAS TO MAKE A 
FAIR DEAL. 
I BELIEVE THAT HE AND I HAVE A 
VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY TOGETHER. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT ABOUT MANY 
LEADERS AND I CAN ALSO TELL YOU 
THAT I DON'T FEEL I WOULD HAVE 
A CHEMISTRY WITH SOME AND FOR 
THOSE PEOPLE I HAVE MIKE POMPEO 
AND NIKKI AND BOLTON AND IF 
THEY CAN'T DO IT I WILL HAVE 
SARAH HUCKABEE DO IT. 
FOR THE MOST PART, VERY GOOD 
WITH PRIME MINISTER ABE AND 
PRESIDENT MOON, AND I KNOW YOU 
WON'T REPORT IT, BUT BRET BAIER 
INTERVIEWED HIM LAST NIGHT. 
I CAN'T SAY IT BECAUSE YOU 
WOULD SAY I'M TOO BRAGGADOCIOUS 
BUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ME LAST 
NIGHT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE 
THING. 
IT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED 
WITHOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
NEVER WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NOBODY ELSE 
-- TAKE A LOOK. 
I WILL TELL YOU THAT CHINA IS 
VERY SPECIAL, VERY SPECIAL. 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, AND 
INCREDIBLE COUNTRY AND WHAT 
THEY'VE DONE IS UNBELIEVABLE. 
IT ALL STARTED WITH A DEFECTIVE 
DEAL. 
WITHOUT THE WTO, CHINA IS NOT 
CHINA AS WE KNOW IT TODAY AND 
IT STARTED ALSO WITH OUR PEOPLE 
THAT ARE STANDING RIGHT IN THIS 
POSITION IN THE OVERALL OFFICE, 
ALLOWING THEM TO GET AWAY WITH 
MURDER. 
WE STILL HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
IN HONOR OF YOU, I WILL MAKE A 
CALL AND SAY, HOW ARE YOU 
DOING? 
I DON'T MIND PAYING BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS A MONTH. 
>> THE LEVEL OF INTERFERENCE 
YOU SEE TODAY FROM THE CHINESE 
TO WHAT RUSSIA DID IN 2016, CAN 
YOU COMPARE THERE? 
>> I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DES MOINES 
REGISTER, THEY HAVE ADS THAT 
ARE MADE TO LOOK LIKE 
EDITORIALS, SAYING YOU HAVE TO 
STOP TRUMP, YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE 
AGAINST HIM. 
THESE ARE PATRIOTS. 
ON A NETWORK THAT DOESN'T LIKE 
ME VERY MUCH, WHICH IS MOST OF 
THEM, A NETWORK THAT DOESN'T 
REALLY TREAT ME VERY GOOD, THE 
INTERVIEWED FARMERS. 
THEY GOT HURT BECAUSE ALL OF A 
SUDDEN CHINA STOPPED BUYING. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED 
BUT THEY ARE BUYING AGAIN AND 
THINGS ARE GOING OUT. 
THERE'S VERY LITTLE HURT FROM 
WHAT I'VE DONE. 
IN FACT, THE MARKETS HAVE GONE 
UP AND FARMERS WILL DO GREAT, 
ULTIMATELY. 
THEY HAD FARMERS IN THESE GUYS 
ARE AMAZING. I 
LOVED THEM AND THEY VOTED FOR 
ME. 
THEY SAID, WE DON'T CARE IF WE 
GET HURT. 
HE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING. 
YOU KNOW, IT'S A COMPLEX GAME. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS OR HOW TO 
DEFINE TARIFF AND THEY DON'T 
KNOW IF IT'S DIFFERENT THAN 
TAXES, BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSE 
AND THEY KNOW THAT FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN MANY, MANY YEARS, 
THEY HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT'S 
FIGHTING FOR THEM. 
THAT ISN'T LETTING THEIR JOBS 
BE TAKEN TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND 
THAT'S NOT ALLOWING THE KIND OF 
ABUSE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT 
HAPPENED AS AN EXAMPLE WITH 
NAFTA -- AND IT WAS NEVER 
CHANGED FOUR YEARS. 
NAFTA WAS DEFECTIVE THE DAY IT 
WAS SIGNED BECAUSE THEY HAD A 
TAX OF 17% AND NOBODY FROM THIS 
COUNTRY KNEW THAT AND BY THE 
TIME THEY FOUND OUT A WEAK 
LATER, NOBODY WENT TO CHANGE 
IT. 
HE WENT MANY YEARS AND THEY 
NEVER CHANGED IT. 
THERE WAS A VAT TAX THAT MEXICO 
GOT. 
WE WERE 17 POINTS OR 16 POINTS 
BEHIND BEFORE WE EVER STARTED. 
NAFTA WAS A HORRIBLE THING. 
THE FARMERS AND THE 
STEELWORKERS -- I STOPPED THE 
DUMPING. THE DUMPING WAS 
HORRIBLE AND NOW IF THEY WANT 
TO DUMP, THAT'S OKAY BUT THEY 
HAVE TO PAY THE U.S. 25% ON 
EVERYTHING THEY DUMPED. 
THAT'S OKAY. 
AS I STROLLED YOU, -- AS I TOLD 
YOU, STEEL IS DOING 
PHENOMENALLY WELL. 
NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER FOUGHT 
FOR US BEFORE AND YOU HAVE TO 
STUDY WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE 15 
YEARS. 
FARMERS HAVE BEEN DECIMATED 
OVER A 15-YEAR PERIOD. 
THEY'VE BEEN DECIMATED AND 
FARMERS WILL COME OUT GREAT. 
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT 
PATRIOTS AND I THINK WE SHOULD 
FINISH WITH THAT ONE. 
IS THAT OKAY? 
GO AHEAD. 
LET'S GO. 
FAST. 
I ALWAYS LIKE TO FINISH WITH A 
GOOD ONE. 
ELTON JOHN SAID, WHEN YOU HIT 
THAT LAST TUNE AND IT'S GOOD, 
DON'T GO BACK. 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN? 
THEY DO GREAT. 
THEY HIT THE LAST ONE AND 
EVERYONE GOES CRAZY AND THEN 
THEY GO BACK FOR THE ENCORE, 
RIGHT? 
AND THEY DON'T HIT IT AND THEY 
LEAVE AND EVERYONE LEAVES AND 
THEY SAY, THAT WASN'T A VERY 
GOOD CONCERT, WAS IT? 
LET'S GO. 
DON'T MAKE ME WRONG. 
>> AHEAD OF THE HEARING 
TOMORROW, YOU WERE ASKED EARLIER
ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE 
SENDING TO THE WOMEN OF THE 
COUNTRY. 
WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU 
MAY BE SENDING TWO YOUNG MEN? 
YOU ARE A FATHER. 
WHAT DOES THIS MOMENT WE ARE 
IN, THE CULTURAL MOMENT -- 
>> IT'S A VERY BIG CULTURAL 
MOMENT. 
>> RIGHT. 
WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU GOING TO 
SEND? 
>> I THINK IT'S A GREAT 
QUESTION. 
IT'S A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR OUR 
COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MAN 
WHOSE VERY OUTSTANDING BUT HE 
HAS VERY STRONG CHARGES AGAINST 
HIM. 
PROBABLY CHARGES THAT NOBODY IS 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVE. 
SO, I COULD HAVE YOU CHOSEN FOR 
A POSITION OR I COULD HAVE YOU 
OR YOU COULD -- ANYBODY -- AND 
SOMEBODY COULD SAY -- AND IS 
HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES. 
FALSE STATEMENTS ARE MADE. 
HONESTLY, NOBODY KNOWS WHO TO 
BELIEVE. 
I COULD PICK ANOTHER SUPREME 
COURT JUDGE, JUSTICE, I COULD 
PICK ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER 
ONE AND THIS COULD GO ON 
FOREVER. 
SOMEBODY COULD COME AND SAY 30 
YEARS AGO, 25 YEARS AGO, 10 
YEARS AGO, FIVE YEARS AGO, HE 
DID A HORRIBLE THING TO ME. 
HE DID THIS OR THAT. 
HONESTLY, IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS 
PERIOD IN OUR COUNTRY. 
IT'S BEING PERPETRATED BY SOME 
VERY EVIL PEOPLE. 
SOME OF THEM ARE DEMOCRATS, I 
MUST SAY. 
BECAUSE, SOME OF THEM KNOW THAT 
THIS IS JUST A GAME THAT THEY 
ARE PLAYING. 
IT'S A CON GAME AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVEL. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT. 
THIS CAN GO ON FOREVER. 
I COULD PICK FIVE OTHER PEOPLE. 
AT A CERTAIN POINT PEOPLE WILL 
SAY NO THANKFUL. 
THIS IS THE MOST COVETED JOB, 
PROBABLY, IN THE WORLD. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I WOULD HONESTLY SAY -- I 
INTERVIEWED GREAT PEOPLE FOR 
THIS JOB -- HE'S GREAT. 
I INTERVIEWED OTHER GREAT 
PEOPLE FOR THIS JOB. 
I COULD CONCEIVABLY IMAGINE 
GOING TO ONE OF THEM AND 
SAYING, IT'S TOO BAD WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THIS WONDERFUL MAN. 
BUT, I'M GOING TO CHOOSE YOU, 
NUMBER TWO. I 
WANT YOU TO GO. 
I COULD CONCEIVABLY BE TURNED 
DOWN BY SOMEBODY THAT 
DESPERATELY WANTED THIS JOB TWO 
MONTHS AGO. 
SO, THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME 
COURT. 
THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND SUPREME 
COURT. 
THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME COURT. 
THIS IS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH 
OUR COUNTRY. 
WHEN YOU ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN
INNOCENT, IT'S JUST NOT 
SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY. 
ALWAYS, I HEARD, YOU ARE 
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 
I'VE HEARD IT FOR SO LONG AND 
IT'S A SUCH A PHRASE. 
IN THIS CASE, YOU ARE GUILTY 
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. 
I THINK THAT IS A VERY, VERY 
DANGEROUS STANDARD FOR OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I LOOK 
FORWARD TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. 
I ALSO LOOK VERY FORWARD TO 
WHAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS TO 
SAY. 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT DAY IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. 
WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. 
>> YOUR MESSAGE TO YOUNG MEN? 
NOTHING TO SAY, SIR? 
>> PLEASE, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN, REMAIN SEATED AS OUR 
DELEGATION DEPARTS. 
>>> I MET ELAINE CANO AND YOU'VE
BEEN LISTENING TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SPEAK IN NEW YORK 
FOLLOWING HIS THIRD DAY AT THE 
U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
HE OPENED TALKING ABOUT TRADE 
IN THE ECONOMY BUT THE 
QUESTIONS QUICKLY TURNED TO 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
ON WEDNESDAY THE THIRD ACCUSER, 
JULIE SWETNICK, CAME FORWARD TO 
SAY THAT KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT 
DURING A GANG RAPE AT A PARTY 
SHE ATTENDED IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
KAVANAUGH DENIES THE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS 
CALLING THE SITUATION, QUOTE, A 
BIG FAT CON JOB BY DEMOCRATS. 
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL RIGHT 
NOW. 
MOLLY HOOPER IS A CBSN 
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 
REPORTER FOR THE HAROLD AND ED 
O'KEEFE -- ED O'KEEFE IS A 
CORRESPONDENT AND HERE IN NEW 
YORK, ERROL BARNETT, CAITLIN 
HUEY-BURNS AND JULIE RENDLEMAN. 
WE HAVE WEIJIA JIANG THAT WAS 
THERE AND WE WILL TRY TO JOIN 
HER IN A MOMENT. 
WE HEARD HER AT THE NEWS 
CONFERENCE. 
A LOT TO GET THROUGH A LOT TO 
GET THROUGH WITH WHAT WE JUST 
HEARD. 
LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE 
WAS CONFIDENT, CAITLIN, HIS 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WILL GET 
ENOUGH VOTES TO BE CONFIRMED 
EVEN FROM SOME DEMOCRATS. 
TWO PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL THINK
THAT? 
>> PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL ARE 
WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
TOMORROW AND WHAT FORD SAYS 
UNDER OATH IN HER TESTIMONY. 
AND, WHAT KAVANAUGH SAYS. 
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER A COUPLE 
OF THINGS WITH THE BACKDROP TO 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 
IT RAN ABOUT ONE HOUR 20 MINUTES
LONG. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WATCHING 
NEWS COVERAGE FOR THE PAST 
WEEK, ALL FOCUSED ON KAVANAUGH 
AND THESE ACCUSATIONS. I 
THINK THE QUESTION WEIJIA JIANG 
BROUGHT UP WAS REALLY 
SIGNIFICANT TO GET THE 
PRESIDENTS WORLDVIEW ON THIS. 
THE PRESIDENT, HIMSELF, HAS MANY
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AGAINST HIM AND WHETHER THAT 
INFORMS HIS OWN VIEW ABOUT 
KAVANAUGH. 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, IN FACT, 
IT DOES. 
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT NOT ONLY 
DIGGING IN TERMS OF DEFENDING 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, BUT REALLY 
VENTING A BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS 
AND WHAT HE THINKS IS AN UNFAIR 
PROCESS. 
HE SEEMED TO BE IN A LIGHT MOOD 
AFTER HE KIND OF GOT THAT OUT 
THERE, CONTINUING TO TAKE 
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESS AND ENGAGING ON A VARIETY 
OF FRONTS AND FLOODING THE ZONE 
WITH INFORMATION. 
PERHAPS TO PROVIDE MORE THINGS 
TO TALK ABOUT, BUT, REALLY, HIS 
DEFENSE OF KAVANAUGH SEEMS 
PRETTY STRONG AT THIS POINT. 
HE ALSO SAID, WE WILL SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS TOMORROW. 
>> LET'S GO TO MOLLY ON CAPITOL 
HILL. 
DID YOU GET ANY KIND OF 
REACTION REAL TIME AS THE NEWS 
CONFERENCE WAS HAPPENING? 
IF SO, WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING? I
WOULD ASK YOU THE SAME THING. 
OF A CONFIDENT KAVANAUGH CAN 
GET CONFIRMED? 
>> Reporter: I WILL CHANNEL MY 
INNER JEFF FLAKE, WHO ACTUALLY 
SPOKE TO BRIEFLY EARLIER TODAY. 
HE WAS IN A HURRY. 
THE PRESIDENT REITERATED THINGS 
HE SAID BEFORE BUT THIS MORNING 
HE WAS INTERESTING WHEN HE SAID 
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ON 
CAPITOL HILL HAVE BEEN TOO 
NICE. 
THEY SHOULD HAVE VOTED ON THIS 
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. 
IF IT WAS ME I WOULD'VE DONE IT 
QUICKER. 
THEY'VE BEEN TOO AN ICE AND 
JEFF FLAKE SAID, HE GOES, WELL, 
THIS IS THE SENATE AND WE ARE 
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
YOU KNOW, MAKING THE POINT THAT 
IT IS MORE COLLEGIAL AND 
CORDIAL AND THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT GRASSLEY WAS HEARING 
DURING THE ONE-DAY LUNCH. 
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE 
POINT THAT REPUBLICANS HAD GONE 
ABOVE AND BEYOND TRYING TO GET 
THESE WITNESSES AND ACCUSERS 
AND ALLEGATIONS -- THE PEOPLE 
BEHIND THE ALLEGATIONS -- TO 
TESTIFY AND THERE WAS A 
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COULD HEAR FROM THE 
MOST RECENT WOMAN WHO CAME OUT 
WITH ALLEGATIONS. 
BUT, THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
UP ON CAPITOL HILL, THEY SORT 
OF FEEL LIKE REPUBLICANS ARE 
FEELING LIKE THE MORE THAT 
COMES OUT, THERE IS A QUESTION 
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM ONE 
OR TWO REPUBLICANS THAT THIS MAY
BE COORDINATED BETWEEN 
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY POINT TO 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN HAVING HELD 
ONTO THAT INFORMATION FOR SO 
LONG BEFORE SHE SENT IT TO THE 
FBI TO MAKE IT MORE PUBLIC AND 
TO GET THE INVESTIGATION. 
>> JULIE, WE HAVE CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD'S PREPARED 
TESTIMONY AHEAD OF THE HEARING 
ON THURSDAY AND I WANT TO READ 
SOME OF THAT. 
PEOPLE MAY NOT OF HAD A CHANCE 
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 
THIS IS ON THE THIRD PAGE. 
THERE WAS MUSIC ALREADY PLAYING 
IN THE BEDROOM. 
IT WAS TURNED UP LOUD OR BY 
EITHER BRETT OR MARK WHEN WE 
WERE IN THE ROOM. 
I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED AND 
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME AND 
BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER MY 
BODY AND GRINDING HIS HIPS INTO 
ME. I 
YELLED, HOPING SOMEONE DOWN 
STAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME. 
I TRIED TO GET AWAY BUT HIS 
WEIGHT WAS HEAVY. 
HE GRABBED ME AND TRY TO TAKE 
OFF MY CLOTHING. 
HE HAD A HARD TIME BECAUSE HE 
WAS DRUNK. 
I WORE A ONE-PIECE BATHING SUIT 
UNDER MY CLOTHING. I 
WAS BELIEVING HE WAS TRYING TO 
RAPE ME. 
HE PUT HIS HAND OVER MY MOUTH 
TO STOP ME FROM SCREAMING AND 
THIS TERRIFIED ME THE MOST AND 
HAD THE MOST LASTING IMPACT ON 
MY LIFE. 
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE 
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME. 
BOTH BRETT AND MARK WERE 
DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE 
ATTACK AND THEY BOTH SEEMED TO 
BE HAVING A GOOD TIME. 
MARCH WAS -- MARK WAS URGING 
BRETT ON ALTHOUGH HE TOLD HIM 
TO STOP AT TIMES. 
I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH MARK 
AND THOUGHT HE MIGHT TRY TO 
HELP ME BUT HE DID NOT. 
TO REMIND PEOPLE, THOSE ARE THE 
RECOLLECTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO 
SAID THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO 
HER AT THE AGE OF 15. 
IT WAS AT THE TIME BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WAS 17 YEARS OLD. 
IS A PROSECUTOR WHO IS 
PROSECUTED SEX CRIMES, WOULD IT 
BE UNUSUAL FOR SOMEONE OF THAT 
AGE TO NOT NECESSARILY REPORT 
TO AUTHORITIES IN A TIMELY WAY? 
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. 
WE SEE THAT TODAY AND WE SEE IT 
NOW MORE BECAUSE OF THE #METOO 
MOVEMENT WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN 
AND WITH BILL COSBY AND WE SEE 
IT WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN 
WHICH YOUNG MEN CAME FORWARD 
YEARS LATER, EITHER TOO SCARED 
TO COME FORWARD OR THEY DIDN'T 
TELL CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS. 
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL AT ALL AND 
THIS COMPLAINANT OR THIS 
VICTIM, HAS TO BE TREATED LIKE 
ANY OTHER VICTIM, WHETHER AN 
INDIVIDUAL CAME FORWARD OR THEY 
CAME FORWARD OR THE EVENT 
HAPPENED 30 YEARS AGO, ARE THEY 
CREDIBLE AND ABLE TO BE 
COLLABORATED? 
-- ABLE TO BE CORROBORATED? 
IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO TESTIFY 
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED 
35 YEARS AGO. 
THAT IS WHY SOMEONE AT MY 
VANTAGE POINT AND MOST OF US 
THINK, WHY IS THERE NOT MORE 
THAN INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF 
THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES THAT 
CAN CORROBORATE AND SUPPORT 
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY, OR SAY 
THAT SHE IS NOT TELLING THE 
TRUTH. 
HOW DOES THAT HURT THE PROCESS 
TO HAVE PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT 
WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH? 
>> JULIE, WE'VE SEEN A LETTER 
FROM CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S 
LAWYERS THAT DETAILS THE 
POLYGRAPH REPORT THAT WE ARE 
SHOWING. 
THE IMAGES ARE FROM WHEN THE 
POLYGRAPH WAS TAKEN. 
IT'S NOT A TRIAL ON THURSDAY. 
HOW SIGNIFICANT OR RELIABLE 
WITH THE LIE DETECTOR TEST BE 
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS? 
>> WE DON'T ALLOW THEM IN 
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE 
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF 
CERTAINTY THAT THEY WORK. 
IT'S USED AS AN INVESTIGATIVE 
TECHNIQUE WHEN IT COMES TO THEM 
TRYING TO GET A WITNESS TO BE 
MORE FORTHCOMING. 
THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID 
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WILLING TO 
TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST 
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE WILLING TO 
TAKE IT, IT INDICATES YOU HAVE 
NOTHING TO HIDE. 
IT MAY WAY ON INDIVIDUALS THAT 
SHE WAS WILLING TO HAVE THIS 
TEST TAKEN. 
>> THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON 
WHETHER HE COULD CHANGE HIS 
MIND ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE 
RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD. 
THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK 
WITH A MAJOR CHANCE TO SPEAK. 
EXCUSE ME. 
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO 
SPEAK.
