don't want to lose my sanity and it
really is like losing your sanity you

it's very much like if you don't have
much to you if you don't have much to
give obviously you're gonna lose but if

don't lose much I like the more we
travel with our kids the better we'll
get at traveling with them and we'll
have less accidents do we have accidents
