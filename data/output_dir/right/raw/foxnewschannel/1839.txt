PUBLIC BATHROOM, BUT WE ARE

17
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:51,467

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,638
WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO FEEL AS

WE WANT YOU TO BE MORE THAN.

25
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:07,549
>> Laura: LET ME GET IT

26
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:07,916
STRAIGHT.

27
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,519
WHEN YOU GO RUNNING ON THE MALL,

28
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,287
YOU GET THE DRINKING FOUNTAINS,

29
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:13,989
WHEN I WAS TRAINING FOR THE

30
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,624
MARATHON YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WOULD

31
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:18,494
BE CLEANING THEIR SOCKS.

32
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:20,629
SO YOU WERE DESPERATE FOR WATER.

33
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,531
THEN YOU SEE SOMEONE CLEANING

YOU DON'T WANT TO DRINK WHEN THE

EVERYBODY.

41
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,147
I HAVE SPOKEN TO STARBUCKS

42
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:38,514
MANAGERS.

43
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,783
THEY SAY IT'S A HEALTH NUISANCE.

44
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:43,852
THEY HAVE TO GO WITH THE HAZMAT

45
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:46,755
OUTFITS TO CLEAN OUT THESE

46
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:47,089

49
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:52,828
YOU ATTRACT THE HOMELESS AND

50
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,230
DRIVE AWAY.

51
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,132
>> Laura: TIME TO GO TO PETE'S.

52
00:01:57,132 --> 00:02:01,236
>> RATHER THAN HAVING THIS 8,000

53
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,838
STORE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING

54
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:09,912
AT THE END OF MAY, THE BETTER IS

55
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:12,014
PUT PUBLIC STALLS, THEN YOU

56
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:14,316
COULD CALL THAT UNCONSCIOUS

57
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,517
COMMON SENSE.

58
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,119
>> Laura: I JUST LIKE WHAT HE

59
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,755
SAID, WE DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL

60
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,790
LIKE YOU ARE LESS THAN.

61
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,293
WE WANT YOU TO BE MORE THAN.

62
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,295
THAT'S A DEEP THOUGHT.

63
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:29,631
WE GOT MAD MAXINE.

64
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,567
MAXINE WATERS, WE HAVE TO PLAY,

65
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,235
SHE WAS UPSET ABOUT --

66
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:37,206

THE REPUBLICANS REPEALED IT, SHE

70
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:42,744
WENT ON A TEAR.

71
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:44,279

DAY AND EVERY WAY.

74
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:49,451
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS STOP

75
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,953
TALKING ABOUT DISCRIMINATION AND

76
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:52,321
START TALKING ABOUT THE NATION.

77
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,623
WE ARE COMING TOGETHER IN SPITE

78
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:56,024

96
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,390
NOT ONE SECOND TO YOU.

104
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:41,937
AND COLLABORATE.

105
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:44,640
SHE AGREES ON SOME ISSUE.

106
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,008
WORK WITH THEM.

107
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,910
FLOOD INSURANCE, HEALTHCARE.

108
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,012
SHE CAN FIND THINGS.

109
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,847
>> Laura: THAT LITTLE ACT, THAT

110
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:54,583
WAS DISHONORABLE.

111
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,150
THAT WAS LAME.

112
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,286
>> HOUSE RULES.

113
00:03:57,286 --> 00:04:03,525
>> Laura: WE GOT RACIST LEGOS.

114
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:07,429
>> MEGAN MARKLE, THEY HAVE

115
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:11,567
CREATED A LEGO, THEY ARE SAYING

116
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,802
IT'S RACIST.

117
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:15,804
SHE HAS THE SAME SKIN TONE AS

118
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:16,838
PRINCE HARRY.

119
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:19,274
I STUDIED AND FOUND PEOPLE

120
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,577
SAYING THE INCREDIBLE HULK WAS

121
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:25,414
LIME GREEN IN HIS LEGO

122
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:25,914
DEPICTION.

123
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,717
HE'S LIME GREEN AND IN THE MOVIE

124
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:29,918
HE'S DARK GREEN.

125
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,521
WE NEED TO BE CONSISTENT.

126
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,022
LEGO HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH

127
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,558
RACISM IN THE PAST.

128
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:40,996
THERE WAS A JOB PLAY SET.

129
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:44,533
HE SMOKED A HUKA AND THAT WAS A

130
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:44,866
PROBLEM.

131
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:51,840
SO THEY WERE

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:51,873
SO THEY RERE

133
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:51,907
SO THEY RECE

134
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:52,841
SO THEY RECALLED THAT.

135
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:55,811
THEY ARE DOING A FOX SET OF PLAY

136
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,679
SETS.

137
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,648
THE INGRAHAM ANGLE IS IT.

138
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,216
THIS IS FROM THE COLLECTION.

139
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:02,818
WE'LL PUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN.

140
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:06,054
THIS IS YOU AND I.

141
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:06,688
JUST LOOK.

142
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:10,025
>> WHY DO I HAVE ORANGE HAIR AND

143
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:14,062
YOU HAVE BIG EARS?

144
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,365
I LOOK LIKE TRUMP.

145
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:19,801
>> I'M UPSET ABOUT THESE DEPICKS

146
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,571
BECAUSE MY EARS LOOK NOTHING

147
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,272
LIKE THAT.

148
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,940
YOU ARE A LITTLE LIGHTER.

149
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,942
>> I'M FINDING THAT.

150
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:30,145
THERE IS INHERENT BIAS AND

151
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:33,282
IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST NATURAL

152
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:33,615
BLONDES.

153
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:36,885
>> I TAKE BACK THE BALANCE OF MY

154
00:05:36,885 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME.
