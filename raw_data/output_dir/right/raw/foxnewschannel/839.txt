1
00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:02,590
TONIGHT'S CONVERSATION.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,525
LET'S START WITH THE BIG EVENT.

3
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:07,561
THIS WAS A COMBINATION OF

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:07,895
THINGS.

5
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:11,999
FOR DECADES AMERICA WAS RUN BY

6
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:16,971
AN ESTABLISHMENT IDEALOLOGY OF

7
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:17,471
GLOBALIZATION.

8
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:21,208
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS A LOT

9
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,143
FAVORED BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY

10
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:26,480
AND CENTRALIZATION OF POWER IN

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,082
THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE.

12
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:30,651
ALSO A READY SUPPLY OF CHEAP

13
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:31,952
IMPORTANT LABOR.

14
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:33,654
THIS BROUGHT HUGE BENEFITS TO

15
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:35,789
THE ELITE THEMSELVES.

16
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:38,225
TO THE 80% OF THE AMERICANS

17
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:39,960
OUTSIDE OF THE KNOWLEDGE

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,762
ECONOMY.

19
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:43,898
INCOMES WENT DOWN, JOBS WENT

20
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:47,167
AWAY, AND THE SOCIAL FABRIC WAS

21
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:49,637
DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED TO OVER

22
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:53,340
TURN THIS ELITIST IDEALOLOGY.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,708
THIS WEEK IT BECAME CLEAR THAT

24
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:58,245
THE ELITE HAS A NEW IDEOLOGY.

25
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,180
THIS TIME IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,183
WITH POLICY.

27
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:08,522
IT'S MUCH SIMPLER AND LESS

28
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:11,592
RATIONAL.  IT'S HATED OF DONALD

29
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:14,228
TRUMP AND HIS FOLLOWERS.

30
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:16,730
THEY SAY THEY FEAR STRANGERS.

31
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,601
IS THERE ANY BETTER DEPICTION OF

32
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:23,237
HOW SENIOR FBI OFFICERS KNOWN AS

33
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:29,410
TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE LAZY,

34
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:44,325
UNEDUCATED, P.O.S. PIECES OF

35
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:44,658
S-H-I-T.

36
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:46,694
THEY FAWN OVERCOME BY.

37
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:48,996
HE PUT HIMSELF ABOVE THE LAW.

38
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,431
THEY JUST HATE TRUMP.

39
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:53,767
THEY SAY HE'S UNDERMINING

40
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,269
DEMOCRATIC NORMS.

41
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:59,440
THIS PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED TO

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,941
THE CONSTITUTION.

43
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,176
THEY HATE TRUMP.

44
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:05,879
THIS WEEK THEY CONDEMNED HIM FOR

45
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,247
BEING NICE THE KIM JONG-UN.

46
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:13,687
THERE IS MUCH MORE CRUELTY IN

47
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:14,021
CHINA.

48
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:16,724
THE ELITE WAS AVOIDING NUCLEAR

49
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:17,458
WAR.

50
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:22,196
THE ELITE CHINA HAD WAS GREED.

51
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:25,733
LOOK AT WHAT BILL SAID.

52
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,635
HOPING FOR A RECESSION SO DONALD

53
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,270
TRUMP DOESN'T GET CREDIT FOR

54
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,706
HELPING WORKING AMERICANS.

55
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:35,242
NANCY IS TRYING TO TURN ANYTHING

56
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:39,279
POSITIVE INTO A NEGATIVE.

57
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,416
NOT EVEN LESS RISK OF NUCLEAR

58
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:47,054
WAR MATTERS TO THESE ELITEST.

59
00:02:47,054 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS THE NEW ELITEST
