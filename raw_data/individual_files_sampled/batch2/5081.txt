with us now we've got former Secretary of State John Kerry's out with a sweeping new memoir entitled every day is extra and I couldn't help as I was looking through the book and looking at some of some of the pictures of some of some of the more important moments in your life there of course is a picture of you with Ted Kennedy but also picture with another senator and a man who you had some strong disagreements with because everybody had strong disagreements but you guys ended up being friends and doing some great things together John McCain what are your thoughts well we miss him already but the example is extraordinary a lot of people suggested we may not see the likes of a John McCain again perhaps not in the context of war and prisoner of war but we need to see senators and congressmen standing up today I mean I can't think of a moment where it is more important for people to do their duty which they have not been doing everybody in Washington Joe knows what's going on and and and it's the chatter I've heard you guys talk about how you've heard these things for months you know what Bob Woodward's book has done to sort of confirm and run together what I hope I think our books are actually complementary and I'm not trying to reach Bob lays out the problem but I think this book shows you how America came through really tough times and how we can solve the problem right by doing our job so that's what I just wanted to ask you about again follow up on on you your relationship with John McCain it seems that that is an example of where this country needs to go because for those who didn't go through Vietnam and certainly went through it and John McCain went through it more personally than almost everybody else you guys were on the opposite sides in that debate he came back thinking that you had undermined America's effort you thought that the war was wrong headed in many ways and yet again on the most divisive issue of our time you guys forged a consensus window work together and help normalize relations that's why honestly Joe I think that's why what I've tried to write is is it's not a policy tome it's a personal journey personal story about America by the young guy who grew up in the Cold War and who's felt as the son of you know Greatest Generation you have to go serve so John McCain and I came to the war from the same place and in an epic flight we had together where we Whittle II didn't know each other we didn't trust each other we talked into the night everybody else is sleeping and we talked on that plane and we agreed the country's still divided over Vietnam we haven't made peace here at home let alone in Vietnam so we decided to work on it together and we really got to know each other we traveled back to Vietnam together I in in a moment I described in the book I mean I stood in John McCain's cell with John McCain alone just the two of us and I thought about the journey we'd made together where we said we're going to make peace with Vietnam are going to make peace in America and there we were these two guys who did come from completely polar opposites but we found common ground and there we were in Hanalei of all places in his cell sharing that common ground it was a very very moving moment and inspirational to me I want to ask you about the op-ed in the New York Times having served in an administration didn't you know well how how these things work but we have a president who is breaking norms by the day aren't there consequences to hearing reports like we're hearing in Bob Woodward's book like we're reading about in the New York Times members of the administration breaking norms in return no it's it's really part of our constitutional process and part of the right of any Americans speak out and you take the consequences when you do go back again and this is part of the history Daniel Ellsberg people who saw a higher responsibility to country wood bothers me about this moment right now is everybody in Washington does know all the Republicans know this they know Donald Trump is not competence not capable of performing the responsibilities of president and it has enormous consequences Richard knows what leaders in other countries are sitting around talking to each other about now if you're a Putin or you're a she you're engaged in the one belt one road project with the trillion dollars being spent in 68 countries and you look at the United States and boy this is our opportunity let's drive it to the hills we have an opportunity loss course cost in what is happening now and nobody's reckoning that in Washington the members of the United States Senate this is what the Senate was defined for this moment and it is a moment that calls on them to do things that are necessary to stop gap what Donald Trump is either not doing or not capable of doing and there are a whole bunch of things I think but the biggest single opportunity we have right now I think is 2018 we can have a course correction in our own democracy that actually revitalizes our democracy and again I write about that and in the book I mean go and go back to 1971 72 71 is when I protest in the war Richard Nixon was very popular then he carried 49 states in 72 one year later he was gone why because people did their jobs the institutions that were there stood up and resisted when I look at this memo it says that when the New York Times says senior they mean senior and they would not have published this because they know the consequences if they didn't have confidence they know who it is and and I think we have to therefore understand the implications of what this person has done would I prefer as others here would that it were public sure but it doesn't diminish the consequence of a what ought to be secretary Kerry the message of Democrats 2018 you've seen some you saw Ayanna Presley winning in Massachusetts for example knocking off work for 15 years is that right it a great knock off a 20 year incumbent there what what is them I know it's district by district but what's the message if it's not just an tied Trump what is the Democrat to message what cuts through this well the message absolutely shouldn't be just adults everybody understands this we're wasting too much time on the tweets and on the daily bloody a team frankly we've got to talk about America's agenda we have to offer a better way of meeting the needs of the American people citizens on the right citizens on the left are equally angry at their lot in life because their needs are not being met and when you have 52 percent of America's income going to 1 percent of Americans you have an unsustainable political equation everybody in America knows this and the reason you went from Gingrich revolution to Tea Party to freedom caucus to Donald Trump and hostile takeover the Republican Party was frustration with the lack of adequate response so we have in two months a referendum on Donald Trump on all of this but it won't work if we're not offering America a way to show the institutions can work how they work and again I come back to the book I think I show in the book again and again how the the Senate could work what it was like when I came there in the 1980s when it was functioning and we were able to get things done we balanced the budget in the 1990s folks and here we are with a completely dysfunctional Washington that also is living in a kind of insidious corruption that comes from the money in American politics and the unwillingness of people to perform their constitutional responsibilities let's talk about what happens when you disagree with the executive when you disagree with the President and States and let's talk about Syria and you gave a speech in the summer of two three summers ago about the need to take on Syria the red line the whole thing everything like that that evening the day that you gave the speech the president United States walks around the South Lawn with Denis McDonough the chief of staff and they change the direction that you were taking what happens internally when you disagree with the decision made by the well I Michael I think it depends on what the consequence of the decision is on occasion you may feel you have to resign as Cyrus Vance did when the decision was made and desert one when they tried to make a rescue in the hostages and that failed different moments different consequences in this case it wasn't a reversal of the direction we were going it was a decision by the President to try to get Congress to participate in it and that was a fair decision by any president to make particularly one or two days after the prime minister of england had gone to parliament for that very reason and and it failed in Parliament so that augmented the need to say whoa if it failed there there's all the more reason to feel you have to have the support of the American people we believe Joe Biden believed I believe the president believed and most of us believe I think Susan Rice was the only one who got it right that Congress wouldn't do something we thought Congress would support it rapidly and we were wrong we miscalculated that so what happens I think you do your best to implement a legitimate policy of the president's one that made sense in that moment but obviously cost us ultimately because of the way it played out right I also want to raise Syria and when you were Secretary of State because here we are meeting today and two can have three million Syrians now are living on on death's door we're about to see the final offensive where the government helped by Iran and Russia is going to crush quite possibly the opposition that's remaining and millions of innocent people their lives are at risk when you look back over the last seven or eight years to Syria what lessons should we take about what the United States did but also the consequences of what we didn't do how does right now Syria Syria is the one of the few greatest scars that exist in the world today in terms of the international community is failure to step up together to find a solution I think there is a solution I think we put it on the table in UN resolution 2254 which all countries including Iran including Russia including China and including the the countries who are the neighbors turkey etc all agreed on a way to be able to resolve Syria by letting the people of Syria elect a new president under a very accountable election run by the international community which would bring the opposition in to participate I mean everybody accepted that the problem is we didn't have any leverage to be able to deal with outside himself and he kept breaking it all the time and the Russians didn't stand up and hold him accountable so what is the lesson I write in the book about how I believe we needed to step in and exercise authority that showed we were willing to hold him accountable which notwithstanding the Russians which including the use of military including the use of before particularly the use of force if he was going to fly as airplanes and drop barrel bombs and Aleppo and we said this was against the norms of behavior we had to back up those norms of behavior and I am very clear about it in the book we had a disagreement on that but I thought it was a different way to approach it so mr. secretary and every day is extra you detail how you came back from Vietnam a disillusioned young man and I just wonder what you believe the message is from this book to young Americans today who may be disillusioned in politics whether they are liberals who can't believe what happened in 2016 or young conservatives who can't believe what happened in 2016 or young independents who look at both sides and say no thanks I'm checking out of the system earlier you talked about how quickly things changed between November 72 and August 7 F or what my message is that you know they hear the words from politicians but they don't always believe them that each individual can really make a difference that's exactly what happened back then Earth Day 20 million people come out they translate it into a movement that made the issue a voting issue and they targeted the 12 worst votes in Congress labeled them the Dirty Dozen and seven of the twelve lost their seats guess what happened Clean Air Act passed Safe Drinking Water Marine Mammal Protection Coastal Zone Management EPA signed into law by Richard Nixon young people made that happen that happened because of people who took a semester off from college the peanut butter and jelly brigades in New Hampshire who elevated gene McCarthy I mean all of it came from this energy for the peace movement for women for the equal rights of them all these things were happening and then once some of those things were accomplished people started went to sleep and backed off we have to rejuvenate re-energize our own democracy in this country we have to make it work here's the magic number fifty four point two fifty four point two percent of the marelit Obol americans voted in 2016 when iran no4 the eligible vote was 60.4% when Barack Obama was elected Inouye it was sixty two point three percent and and and then it dropped down in the reelect to 58 percent you know the last time it was fifty four point two percent Al Gore so the lesson is it's not the people who did vote who elected Donald Trump's people who didn't vote young people need to understand the importance of the vote historically they don't notice turnout and we have to motivate people don't say climate change I can't think of an issue that will motivate we're heading towards four degrees centigrade in this century it will be absolutely catastrophic for Refugees crops water I mean we're already seeing the consequences hottest ten years in in recorded history last year the hottest year in history the the ten years before that the the second hottest 10 years the ten years before that the third hottest ten years isn't there a message from that somewhere when President Xi President Putin president macro all these people are adhering to the Paris agreement and only Donald Trump without a shred of evidence without shred of scientific fact pulls out these are the issues that I believe will motivate people and over the next two months whether it's health care or education or opportunity or fair wages we have a message and we need to take that out and get young people to organize around it the memoir is too every day is extra former Secretary of State
