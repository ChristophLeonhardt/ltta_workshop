so basically what he said and I have seen some of the transcript what he said was we should believe women even though these are a pack of line he didn't cop to anything except grabbing some but but but you know on the right we we are being people are a little suspicious of this sudden turn to sexual morality on the left and it just looks like a political thing they didn't do it to Clinton nobody still is still they haven't thrown Bill Clinton under the bus they're not gonna lose a seat because the governor of Minnesota is going to appoint and he's a he's a Democrat and so they're not gonna lose a seat but this does give them a place John Conyers also resigning this does give them a greater moral standing on which to attack Roy Moore and who's running in Alabama so what they're gonna do now I think Brit Hume said they're gonna make Roy Moore the hood ornament OB and that you know it's it's a it's a clever plan so it doesn't look it doesn't look like morality also the guy was accused he admitted to doing some of these things he was fated that dithering thing I don't know why these guys don't either say I did it and I'm sorry or I didn't do it you know when one of the other he did that dithering thing where I remember differently it's hard it's hard not to know when you have grabbed somebody by the backside I mean I think that or or tried to force a kiss on them that they didn't want he's also married so if he's been doing this a lot you know it's there's a lot of immoral things but they but the question there really are questions about whether he's broken the law whether he has broken the ethic the rules of the Senate he's being railroaded and he's being railroaded in order to put the Democrats that doesn't mean he's not guilty I'm just saying he's being railroaded without due process to put the Democrats in a better position to attack Roy Moore and I have to say that there are some really there are two really interesting articles today about the Roy Moore situation one of them is from in the Wall Street Journal where they say you know it's not hard to see what's going on here they're attacking the Democrats the Democrats are creating a frank and more nightmare for Donald Trump Monday brought mr. Trump's more endorsement followed by commitment of support from the Republican National Committee the next day representative John Conyers stepped down from his House seat so in other words the fact that the the Trump and the RNC did finally back Roy Moore put them in this vulnerable position but Ann Coulter has written a brilliant brilliant column and I just want I want to read part of this she she points out and I think this is fair to say about Roy Moore she says one of the accusers the one who accused Moore of being violent with her has been called a liar by her own stepson who says he's voting for Moore and another neglected to mention that Moore sent her brother to prison in defense of one of Moore's accusers Gloria Allred produced a yearbook allegedly signed by Moore apparently in two different inks and giving his title as DA he was not the district attorney and didn't sign his name that way Allred refuses to produce the yearbook for handwriting analysis contrary to what you have heard and this is the point that sticks with me contrary to what you have heard 1 million times a day on TV there aren't multiple accusers there are two and that's including the one with the fishy yearbook inscription who step-son says she's lying the other accusers claimed he dated them when they were 16 to 19 years old and Moore was in his early 30s or as we pointed out you know one of the things is I always point out things too early because I'm always the first person to point them out and then other people get the credit here's and picking up the point that I made the first day Moore was younger than Jerry Seinfeld was at 39 when he dated seventeen-year-old Shoshana lonstein and got on the cover I think it was People magazine or oz okay she says that would also make more 15 years younger than Bill Clinton when he had a 22 year old in turn performing oral sex on him and the Oval Office Moore's date accusers say he did nothing more than kissed them so in other words legal dating 16 is the age of consent in Alabama and it didn't get very far it may be creepy but it's not illegal and maybe it's not for us to judge this is Ann Coulter the media throw the dating claims in with the molestation claims I have made this point too and she's absolutely right the media throw the dating claims in with the malla station claims so they can keep howling about multiple accusers in fact only two women are alleging anything that if true wouldn't merit national attention in other words a guy runs for the Senate you can say he shouldn't have dated young women but it was legal I mean you and he didn't attack them he kissed them during date in September 2006 just before the midterm elections the media released oh so now she goes back in time just to remind you of how the media behaved and this is the important point because this is something I think we all forget from time to time how very very bad the media is in September 2006 just before the midterm elections the media released GOP congressman mark Foley's creepy emails to house pages no physical contact was alleged the corpus delicti was that Foley told pages mail pages I believe it was that they looked hot in their soccer shorts the entire GOP was crucified by the media for not having discovered this pedophile in its midst Republican congressman who had never met Foley lost their seats because of the media's timing of the email release more than 20 years earlier a Democrat congressman Jerry studs who had actually had sex with a 17 year old Paige indignantly defied his House censure and proudly stood for re-election his outraged Massachusetts constituents elected him six more times Washington Post columnist Coleman McCarthy denounced the witch-hunt against him saying his critics wanted to torch the congressman for his private life when suds died in 2006 The Washington Post headline on his obituary was Jerry studs gay pioneer in Congress the New York Times headline was Jerry studs dies at 69 first openly gay congressman in other words she's saying there's a tremendous double standard the media say the Republicans support more just because they want another GOP vote in the Senate and she says Ann Coulter says I support more just because I hate the media and so and so there are all these questions coming up and how do we know how do we judge when it's so difficult to judge other people's sex lives because who wants to enter into their world and pass judgment on another person's sex life I don't I don't want to spend a single minute worrying about this
