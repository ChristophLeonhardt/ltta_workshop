“We are rabid Americanists.
So we believe that our industry
should remain in our country.
We love our Harleys.
We love the whole spirit
of the whole thing.
It would break our hearts
to have to condescend
to an inferior motorcycle.”
This is Sturgis.
It’s a motorcycle rally that
attracts half a million bikers
to South Dakota every year.
“It’s like a pilgrimage
of misfits, blue collar,
evangelical bikers for
Christ and veterans.”
And while it’s not an exclusive
Harley-Davidson rally,
their presence is overwhelming.
“Harley-Davidson has attitude.”
“It’s the sound, the feel.”
“The rumble and the shake.”
“It’s in my blood.”
“If I have to explain,
you wouldn’t understand.”
“It’s American made. Or, was.”
And that’s what makes this year
a bit more political than usual.
“Harley-Davidson, please build
those beautiful motorcycles
in the U.S.A., please. O.K.?
Don’t get cute with us.
Don’t get cute.”
After Trump announced tariffs
on steel and aluminum,
the E.U. responded
with tariffs of its own,
targeting American motorcycles,
and Harley said it
would have to move
more of its production overseas.
That did not sit well
with some Harley owners.
“This is my last Harley-Davidson.
I’ll go to an Indian next time
unless they change
their mind and wise up.
We know that there are
parts on here that don’t
come from America cause
America don’t make them all.
But that’s not moving
the whole factory over.
We’ve been loyal to them,
and we just want loyalty back.”
This is the Fab 4.
Jawbone,
Bent,
Scrapper
and Stinger.
They founded the Dirty Old
Bastards Society five years ago,
and they own Stinger Saloon 
in downtown Sturgis.
For them, this recent move
by Harley crosses a line.
“The reason why people move
to foreign countries
is because they’re
greedy bastards.
I’m not saying that Harley’s
a greedy bastard,
but usually when people
leave this country
it’s because they want
to make more profit.
They don’t want to pay the
common man a fair wage.”
It’s not that Harley hasn’t
moved jobs abroad before.
They have factories in India,
Brazil, Australia and Thailand.
But Trump has put the company
at the center of
the political stage.
“Made in America!”
At the State of the Union,
Trump said Harley
was a victim of unfair
trade practices abroad.
“They weren’t even asking
for a change. But I am.”
And those politics have
trickled down to Sturgis.
“We want Harley-Davidson
to survive this storm,
but the person they've
got steering this ship
is way out of touch.”
Chris Cox is the founder
of Bikers for Trump.
He takes aim not at the brand,
but at the company’s C.E.O.,
Matt Levatich,
for moving things abroad.
“They’ve been planning
this for a long time
and for him to suggest
that it was because
of Donald Trump and
the tariffs is absurd.”
But some people feel
that this is what Harley
has to do to survive —
as long the bikes they buy
remain American-made.
“Well Harley owners
are feeling betrayed
because it’s ‘U.S.A., Harley!’
But if I owned Harley
I’d do the same thing.”
“If they’re going to go
abroad to save money,
hopefully they’re only
going to do that
for the motorcycles that
they’re going to sell abroad.
Hopefully us in America
are going to be able
to buy what’s made in America.
You know, but I support them.
I love their motorcycles.
I love their brand.
I couldn’t let them down.
There’s no way.”
