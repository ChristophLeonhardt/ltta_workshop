A special election in Arizona
was triggered by a sex scandal
involving Republican Trent Franks.
A former staffer said he asked her
to carry his baby in
exchange for $5 million.
The controversy spurred
him to quit in December.
“What does the statement say?”
“Take a look at it.”
And now the race is on to fill his seat.
The Republican? Debbie Lesko.
“I’m a conservative Republican.”
Served in State Legislature.
It’s her race to lose.
Campaigning as a domestic
violence survivor
and victims’ advocate.
“I left an abusive ex-husband.”
The Democrat is Hiral Tipirneni.
“It’s time for a change.”
Not a politician.
She’s an E.R. doctor.
A bonus in a district 
with 20 percent seniors.
She’s the underdog.
“We have a really great
shot at flipping this seat.”
The Eighth District?
It’s in the Phoenix suburbs.
Very Republican.
Wannabe senator and Trump superfan
Sheriff Joe Arpaio is based here.
“I’m a big supporter of the president.”
Two big issues.
The first is health care.
Tipirneni wants universal coverage.
“Affordable quality health care.”
Lesko wants to cut health care
spending, but is vague.
“I don’t know what, ultimately, we can do.
I just know it needs to be done.”
Then there’s the wall.
Lesko? Pretty much for it.
“Part of the solution is building the wall.”
Tipirneni’s not.
“There are other areas to use that money.”
Speaking of money,
Republicans and their allies
aren’t taking any chances.
After recent losses in
strongholds like Alabama
and Pennsylvania’s 18th District
They’ve spent over
a million for Lesko.
Trump won this district
by more than 20 points.
So even a close finish by the
Democrats would be a surprise.
