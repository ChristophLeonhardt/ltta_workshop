IS NOT TALKING ABOUT THE IG
REPORT.
THERE WAS ANOTHER HEARING
YESTERDAY ON CAPITOL HILL.
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING THE
MEDIA WOULD RATHER FOCUS ON
IMMIGRATION AND ALL THESE OTHER
THINGS.
YET THIS YOUR REPORTING
YESTERDAY YOU SPECIFICALLY
REPORTING ON THE FINDINGS OF THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OUR VIEWERS
THROUGH THAT AND WHAT ULTIMATELY
THE RESULTS OF THAT HEARING
WERE?
>> YES THIS MORNING I GOT UP AT
5:00 A.M.
TO REPORT FOR CBS THIS
MORNING ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
REPORT.
LAST NIGHT I WAS HERE UNTIL
ABOUT 8:00 P.M.
ON ADDITIONAL
FINDINGS FROM THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL REPORT.
I THINK WE ALSO MANAGED TO COVER
IMMIGRATION YESTERDAY AS WELL.
THE PRESIDENT IS UPSET THAT THE
IMMIGRATION DEBATE IS
DISTRACTING FROM A LARGER
CONTROVERSY OVER AN FBI AGENT
NAMED PETER STRZOK.
HE WORKED ON THE CLINTON EMAIL
INVESTIGATION AND ALSO THE
RUSSIA PROBE.
AND HE SUBSEQUENTLY WENT TO WORK
FOR ROBERT MUELLER.
ANTI-TRUMP TEXT MESSAGES WERE
EXCHANGED BETWEEN STRZOK AND
LISA PAIGE WHO ALSO WORKED ON
THIS INVESTIGATION.
NOW MANY OF THESE NEW TEXT
MESSAGES WERE UNCOVERED IN AN
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT.
THAT'S AN INTERNAL WATCHDOG.
HE WORKS AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT AND HE SPENT THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS
REVIEWING HOW THE FBI HANDLED
THIS INVESTIGATION INTO CLINTON
'S USE OF A PRIVATE SERVER.
THEY PUBLISHED A 500 PAGE REPORT
LAST THURSDAY WHICH I READ AND
HAVE REPORTING ON EXTENSABLY.
ONE OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IS
STRZOK, PAIGE, AND THREE OTHER
OFFICIALS WERE RECOMMENDED FOR
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE
OF THESE ANTI-TRUMP TEXT
MESSAGES.
AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ON THE
PART OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN BIAS
THAT INFLUENCED THEIR WORK AT
THE FBI.
>> WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PETER
STRZOK NOW?
>> HE'S CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS WITHIN
FBI.
WE LEARNED HE WAS ESCORTED OUT
OF THE FBI BUILDING ON FRIDAY.
HE IS STILL TECHNICALLY
EMPLOYED.
HE WAS KICKED OFF THE MUELLER
PROBE AFTER THESE TEXTS WERE
UNCOVERED AND REASSIGNED TO THE
HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT.
HE IS GOING TO FIGHT FOR HIS
JOB.
I INTERVIEWED HIS LAWYER LAST
NGHT AND HE SAID STRZOK WILL
CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO WORK AT THE
FBI WHERE HE HAS WORKED FOR
20 YEARS.
ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S
VERY UNLIKELY MR. STRZOK WILL BE
ABLE TO RECLAIM HIS JOB AFTER
THIS DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATION
GOES THROUGH.
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, EVEN AN
INDEPENDENT WATCHDOG IS ACCUSING
HIM OF TAINTING TWO OF THE MOST
POLITICALLY SENSITIVE
INVESTIGATIONS IN U.S. HISTORY.
BUT HIS LAWYER SAYS HE WANTS TO
GO BEFORE CONGRESS, HE WANTS TO
TESTIFY, HE WANTS TO TESTIFY.
AND HE DOES NOT WANT REPUBLICANS
PAINTING HIM OR HIS ACTIONS
UNFAIRLY.
THIS IS NOT THE LAST WE HAVE
HEAR OF HIM.
WE SHOULD HEAR FROM HIM BEFORE
CONGRESS IN A FEW WEEKS.
>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE
ARE RECEIVING POOL NOTES WHO ARE
VIEWERS WHO ARE NOT AWARE.
>> I'LL PICK UP MY PHONE TO READ
THEM.
>> POOL NOTES ARE THE POOL OF
REPORTERS MONITORING WHAT
HAPPENS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND THEY'RE REPORTING WHAT THE
PRESIDENT IS SAYING.
WE'LL GET THAT PLAYED BACK FOR
OUR VIEWERS AT SOME POINT.
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCORDING TO
THE POOL NOTES SAYING TO
REPORTERS AND SOME MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS WHO ARE THERE AS WELL
AS SOME MEMBERS OF THE CABINET
THAT THE DILEMMA IS IF YOU'RE
WEAK THE COUNTRY WILL BE
OVERWHELMING WITH PEOPLE.
IF YOU'RE STRONG YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY HEARTS.
PERHAPS I WOULD LIKE TO BE
STRONG.
SENATOR TOM COTTON ALSO SPOKE
AND SUGGESTED THAT CHILDREN
QUOTE CAN'T BE A GET OUT OF JAIL
FREE CARD FOR IMMIGRANTS.
AND AGAIN IT JUST SORT OF
HIGHLIGHTS THE DISTINCTION
THATS BEING MADE HERE THAT
PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME TO THIS
COUNTRY FOR A BETTER LIFE
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE
HORRIFIC CONDITIONS IN THEIR
COUNTRIES THAT THERE ARE SOME
PEOPLE WHO WOULD BELIEVE THAT
THEY'RE USING THEIR CHILDREN AS
SOME KIND OF A PAWN OR SOME KIND
OF A CARD OR A GET OUT OF JAIL
FREE CARD.
WHEN IN REALITY THE DANGER WOULD
B LEAVING YOUR CHILDREN IN A
PLACE THAT'S NOT AS FREE AS YOU
WOULD BE HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES.
BUT THAT IS THE NOTE COMING OUT
OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
SO WE'RE EXPECTING TO GET THAT
TAPE PLAYED BACK VERY, VERY
SOON.
APPARENTLY IN THE ROOM THE
SECRETARY OF STATE, LAWMAKERS
INCLUDE SENATOR GRAHAM, SENATOR
ALEXANDER, CORNYN.
SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER
OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN THE
ROOM.
>> AND JUST SORT OF AN ADDED
NUGGET ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR
POOL NOTES.
HE ALSO ANNOUNCED HE'S
CANCELLING THE ANNUAL
CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC.
THE REASON WHY IT JUST DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT.
THIS IS A QUOTE IT DOESN'T FEEL
RIGHT TO HAVE A PICNIC FOR
CONGRESS.
AND AS WE SPECULATE AS TO WHAT
PROMPTED THIS, ONCE AGAIN WE
KNOW HE'S GOING TO SIGN
SOMETHING.
AS WE SPECULATE AS TO WHAT
PROMPTED THIS, I WONDER IF SOME
OF THE PUSHBACK ON SOCIAL MEDIA
HAS HAD AN IMPACT.
YOU KNOW HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA
TWEETED OUT SOME IMAGES FOR
FATHERS DAY OF HER CHILDREN.
AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS AN ON
ONSLAUGHT OF PUSHBACK.
AS THE KIDS SAY IT'S NOT A GOOD
LOOK TO BE OUT THERE PICNICKING
WHILE CHILDREN ARE OUT THERE
CRYING AND BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM
THEIR PARENTS.
>> THE CORE OF THAT IS
CONGRESSIONAL INACTION.
AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE TRUMP
PLATFORM, DRAINING THE SWAMP,
GETTING RID OF THE GRIDLOCK
THAT'S NOT SERVING PEOPLE.
YOU DON'T NEED THE CRISIS AT THE
BORDER TO KNOW THAT A LOT OF
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE VERY
IMPRESSED TO SEE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS EATING SANDWICHES AND
DRINKING SODA WHILE THEY'RE NOT
ACTUALLY PASSING ANYTHING TO
SOLVE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THE
U.S. IS FACING.
AND TODAY WHAT'S TOP OF MIND IS
IMMIGRATION.
SO AS AN OPTICS MATTER IT MAKES
SENSE TO CANCEL THAT PICNIC.
>> AND THE FACT IS THAT MANY
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY RANGING
FROM REPUBLICANS TO DEMOCRATS TO
RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE ALL COMING
OUT.
FORMER FIRST LADIES WERE COMING
OUT AGAINST IT AS LAURA BUSH
DID.
EVEN MELANIA, THE CURRENT FIRST
LADY TWEETED SOMETHING THAT
SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT SHE WAS
NOT AS SUPPORTIVE.
>> AT LEAST THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF FAMILIES BEING
SEPARATED.
>> SO WE HAVE SOME TAPE PLAY
BACK FROM EARLIER TODAY WHERE
DEMOCRATS WERE TALKING ABOUT
THIS ON THE HILL.
SOME OF THEM GOT VERY
PASSIONATE.
I WANT TO PLAY THAT THEN WE'LL
TALK ABOUT IT.
>> AS TO ALL OF THE YOUNG
PEOPLE, TO ALL OF THE CHILDREN,
WE ARE GETTING IN TO SET PEOPLE
FREE.
HISTORY WILL NOT BE KIND TO US.
THIS HAS GONE ON TOO LONG.
AND IT MUST STOP.
IT MUST STOP NOW.
NOT TOMORROW BUT NOW.
NOW IS THE TIME TO DO WHAT IS
RIGHT, WHAT IS FAIR, AND WHAT IS
JUST.
>> CHILD ABUSE IS A VIOLATION OF
HUMAN RIGHTS.
AND THE WORLD IS WATCHING.
>> THIS IS NOT A 0 TOLERANCE
POLICY.
WHAT IT IS IS A 0 HUMANITY
POLICY.
IT HAS TO STOP AND IT HAS TO
STOP NOW.
>> I NEVER THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD
HAVE A DAY WHERE CHILDREN ARE
BEING USED AS LEVERAGE, AS
PAWNS, FOR RANSOM.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOLERATED.
WE HAVE TO STOP THAT BEFORE THE
ELECTION.
BUT WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.
>> SO DEMOCRATS, VERY
PASSIONATE.
AND A SHORT TIME AFTER THAT U
PAUL RYAN SPOKE TO REPORTERS.
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN RESPONSE
TO THIS PENDING LITIGATION
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT FORTH.
>> THIS BILL IS PLAN B FOR US TO
BEGIN WITH.
BY THE WAY IT SOLVES DACA IN A
VERY ELEGANT WAY I THINK.
IT'S A VERY ELEGANT SOLUTION FOR
DACA.
SO WE'RE FOCUSSED ON GETTING
THIS BILL PASSED.
THE PRESIDENT CAME TO OUR
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY AND ASKED
MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL.
THAT IS OUR FOCUS.
IF OTHER THINGS HAPPEN WE'LL
CROSS THOSE BRIDGES WHEN WE GET
TO IT.
>> THE DEMOCRATS TALKED A BIT
ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THE
LEGISLATION.
WE DIDN'T PLAY ANY OF THAT.
BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN
SAYING THE DEMOCRATS WON'T SIGN
LEGISLATION.
SO THIS IS THE LEGISLATION PAUL
RYAN IS TALKING ABOUT.
IT'S CALLED THE COMPROMISE BILL.
BUT PAULA IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS IT'S A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND MORE
HARDLINE CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICANS WHO NOT ONLY WANT TO
CUT DOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
BUT ALSO LEGAL IMMIGRATION.
>> EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHERE THE TENSION IS.
THE DEMOCRATS SEEM UNITED ON
THEIR MESSAGE BUT WITHIN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE ARE SHARP
DIVIDES.
THERE ARE MORE MODERATE
REPUBLICANS WHO WANT PROTECTIONS
FOR DREAMERS.
THEN THEY'RE STANDING SIDE BY
SIDE WITH IMMIGRATION
HARDLINERS.
AND THIS WAS A CORE TENANT OF
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PLATFORM WITH
STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF OUR
IMMIGRATION LAWS.
ALONG WITH A WALL, BORDER
SECURITY.
THIS WAS A BIG PART OF WHY A LOT
OF PEOPLE SUPPORTED THE
PRESIDENT.
WHILE CLEARLY WE SAW IN THAT
FIRST CLIP THERE WERE A LOT OF
PEOPLE EMOTIONAL OVER THIS
POLICY.
THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF OTHER
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IT IS AN
ESSENTIAL DETERRENT TO THE WORLD
THAT THE U.S. IS ENFORCING
IMMIGRATION LAWS.
IT PUTS REPUBLICANS IN A
CRITICAL SPOT DURING A CRITICAL
ELECTION YEAR.
>> SO BEYOND THE RHETORIC THAT
HAS BEEN USED BY DEMOCRATS, BY
REPUBLICANS, BY THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES HIMSELF, MANY
REASONABLE PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW
WOULD AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO
BE A FIX TO IMMIGRATION.
AND PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS HAVE
TRIED.
PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED, PRESIDENT
BUSH TRIED AND WERE NOT ABLE TO
GET THE BALL OVER THE GOAL LINE.
BUT IF YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE
BUBBLED UP OVER THE LAST
18 MONTHS OR SO THEY ARE A
DIRECT RESULT OF SOME OF THE
ACTIONS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
HAS TAKEN INCLUDING THE ISSUE
WITH THE DREAMERS RIGHT NOW.
IF THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAD NOT
GIVEN CONGRESS AN ARTIFICIAL
TIMETABLE TO FIX THAT ISSUE WE
WOULDN'T BE WHERE THEY ARE TODAY
WITH ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES.
IF THE PRESIDENT THROUGH THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD NOT
IMPLEMENTED THIS 0 TOLERANCE
POLICY BACK IN APRIL.
HE WOULDN'T BE FACING WHAT SOME
WOULD ARGUE RIGHT NOW AND AGAIN
IT SEEMS THERE'S ALWAYS
SOMETHING EVERY WEEK.
BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT CRISIS OF HIS
POLICY.
>> BUT THIS IS SORT OF PART OF
THE PRESIDENT'S TACTICS.
WHEN IT CAME TO DACA HE
DELIBERATELY ENDED THE DACA
PROTECTIONS IN THE HOPES OF
FORCING CONGRESS TO HAMMER OUT
SOME SORT OF COMPREHENSIVE
IMMIGRATION POLICY OR
IMMIGRATION LAW.
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
THE DEADLINE CAME AND WENT.
AND WHAT YOU SEE WITH THIS
COMPROMISE BILL AND YOU HEARD
PAUL RYAN REALLY HIGHLIGHT THE
DACA COMPONENT OF IT BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT PROMPTED ALL OF
THESE DISCUSSIONS THIS DACA
PROTECTION ENDING.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM IN THE
MEANWHILE ANOTHER VERY PRESSING
ISSUE BUBBLED TO THE SURFACE.
IT SEEMS TO BE PART OF THE
PRESIDENT'S TACTIC TO SORT OF
CREATE A CRISIS TO ENCOURAGE
CONGRESS TO ACT.
BUT ON IMMIGRATION IT'S NOT
WORKING.
>> THAT COULD BE PART OF IT.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE BORDER.
ONE OF THE ACHEECHLTS OF THE
PRESIDENT'S FIRST YEAR WAS THAT
ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS WERE
DOWN BY THE DOUBLE DIGITS.
BUT THERE WAS AN UP TICK AND
THAT WAS A SIGNAL TO THE CHIEF
OF STAFF JOHN KELLY AND ATTORNEY
GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS THAT THIS
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO
IMPLEMENT A POLICY THEY HAD BEEN
CONSIDERING FOR WELL OVER A YEAR
WHICH IS A 0 TOLERANCE POLICY
AND USING SEPARATING FAMILIES AS
A DETERRENT.
THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS ON THE
RECORD SAYING THIS IS A
DETERRENT.
THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY SAID THEY
BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE A
DETERRENT.
IN MANY WAYS THEY HAVE WANTED TO
DO THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
AND THE FACT THAT ILLEGAL BORDER
CROSSINGS WERE INCREASING GAVE
THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT
HOWEVER IT IS THE PRESIDENT AND
SOME OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN
CONGRESS WHO WILL BEAR THE
ULTIMATE POLITICAL PRICE OF
THOSE PICTURES AND THE AUDIO OF
THOSE THINGS WE'RE SEEING COMING
UP FROM THE BORDER.
TALKING WITH THE PRESIDENT IN
THE PAST WEEK HE DID THAT GAGGLE
ON FRIDAY AND CAME DOWN AND TALK
TODAY US.
HE DIDN'T SEEM READ IN ON THE
VARIOUS PROPOSALS.
HE SAID HE DIDN'T REALLY LIKE
SEPARATING FAMILIES BUT HE
SEEMED SQUAREL FOCUSSED ON
NORTH KOREA AND THE ECONOMY AND
HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THOSE
REALMS.
THIS DID NOT SEEM TO BE
SOMETHING THAT HE WAS ESPECIALLY
FOCUSSED ON.
AND PERHAPS THAT IS PART OF WHY
HE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
POLITICAL BLOWBACK THERE WOULD
BE WHEN THIS WAS ACTUALLY
IMPLEMENT AND HAD PEOPLE STARTED
SEEING PICTURES AND HEARING THE
STORIES OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS.
>> THE PRESIDENT DID TWEET TODAY
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
NORTH KOREA AS MUCH AS HE
EXPECTED THEY WOULD BE.
AGAIN AS YOU'RE READING ALONG
WITH US HERE ON YOUR PHONE YOU
HAVE SEEN THE POOL NOTES THE
MOST RECENT POOL NOTE NUMBER SIX
OF THE PRESIDENT TAKING
QUESTIONS AND CONFIRMING THAT HE
WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
GOING ON TO SAY THAT THE IMAGES
THAT HAVE BEEN FLASHING ACROSS
TELEVISION SCREENS HERE AND
AROUND THE WORLD EFFECT
EVERYONE.
OF COURSE WENT BACK AND BLAMED
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYING
YOU HAVE DOUBLE STANDARDS.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR
50 YEARS.
PAULA, YOU WILL KNOW AS WELL AS
SOME OF OUR VIEWERS THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID FACE
INCREASED SPIKES IN ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION DURING HIS TERMS IN
OFFICE.
AND THERE WAS THAT NICKNAME THAT
WAS FLOATED FOR MANY, MANY YEARS
DEPORTER IN CHIEF.
PRESIDENT OBAMA DEPORTED MORE
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THE
UNITED STATES THAN ANY OTHER
PREVIOUS PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM.
BUT HERE THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE
SAYING THAT THIS PROBLEM ALL
BEGAN BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS
ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
THE QUESTION OF COURSE IS EVEN
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA DEPORTED
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HE DIDN'T
SEPARATE CHILDREN, TODDLERS,
YOUNG KIDS FROM THEIR
PARTICIPANTS.
>> WELL THERE WERE ASPECTS OF
THAT POLICY ACTUALLY THAT DID
HAVE TO BE CARRIED OUT AFTER THE
FLORES DECISION IN THE NINTH
CIRCUIT AFTER THAT DECISION CAME
DOWN.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS
BEHOLDEN TO THAT.
BUT ONE WAY TO GET AROUND THAT
IS TO NOT CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE
PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THE
BORDER ILLEGALLY.
YOU HANDLE IT AS A CIVIL MATTER
AND THEN PEOPLE ARE NOT
INCARCERATED.
THAT'S REALLY THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE 0 TOLERANCE POLICY
AND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE
FINAL DAYS OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION IS THEY HAVE NOW
DECIDED TO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE
PEOPLE.
KIDS CAN'T GO TO JAIL, THEY
CAN'T BE INCARCERATED FOR CRIMES
THAT'S WHY FAMILIES NEED TO BE
SEPARATED.
THAT'S A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN
HOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
HANDLED THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS
AND HOW THE SESSIONS JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT DECIDED TO PROCEED.
>> WE'RE ABOUT 42ndS OR SO AWAY
FROM THE TAPE PLAYBACK OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TALKING TO REPORTERS WITH SOME
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THERE WITH
HIM.
SO THAT WILL ROLL OUT.
WE'LL WATCH WHAT THE PRESIDENT
HAS TO SAY THEN WE'LL COME BACK
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT ACTION HE
MAY POTENTIALLY BE TAKING TO END
WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SEEING FLASH ACROSS YOUR SCREENS
OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.
AND FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD
HAS DISTURBED PEOPLE IN
SIGNIFICANT WAYS.
SO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT TAPE
PLAYBACK VERY, VERY SOON.
YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT.
LET'S GO AND WATCH THE
PRESIDENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH
EVERYBODY.
I'LL BE LEAVING FOR MINNESOTA
TODAY.
WE HAVE TWO STOPS.
ONE A VERY BIG ONE AND IT WILL
BE A LOT OF FUN.
I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE GOING
WITH US SO THAT WILL BE
INTERESTING.
WE'RE MEETING RIGHT NOW ON
IMMIGRATION.
AND WE ARE VERY STRONG AT THE
BORDER.
WE'RE VERY STRONG ON SECURITY.
WE WANT SECURITY FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
THE REPUBLICANS WANT SECURITY
AND INSIST ON SECURITY FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
AND WE WILL HAVE THAT AT THE
SAME TIME WE HAVE COMPASSION, WE
WANT TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
I'LL BE SIGNING SOMETHING IN A
LITTLE WHILE THAT'S GOING TO DO
THAT.
AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WANT
TO DO THAT AND THEY'RE WORKING
ON VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION
TO GET IT DONE.
BUT I'LL BE DOING SOMETHING
THAT'S SOMEWHAT PREEMPTIVE BUT
ULTIMATELY WILL BE MATCHED BY
LEGISLATION I'M SURE.
WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS
WITH DEMOCRATS, THEY DON'T WANT
TO VOTE FOR ANYTHING.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT LACK OF
SECURITY.
THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE
OPEN BORDERS WHERE ANYBODY IN
THE WORLD CAN JUST FLOW IN
INCLUDING FROM THE MIDDLE EAST,
FROM ANYBODY ANYWHERE THEY CAN
JUST FLOW INTO OUR COUNTRY.
TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH THAT.
TREMENDOUS CRIME CAUSED BY THAT.
WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT.
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE
WE'RE ALL SO BUSY AND I JUST
MENTIONED TO THE CONGRESSMAN AND
THE SENATORS IN THE ROOM THAT WE
ARE GOING TO CANCEL AND POSTPONE
TOMORROWS CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC.
WE HAVE A CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC
TOMORROW.
AND I WAS JUST WALKING OVER TO
THE OVAL OFFICE AND I SAID YOU
KNOW IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO
HAVE A PICNIC FOR CONGRESS WHEN
WE'RE WORKING ON DOING SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT.
WE HAVE MANY THINGS THAT ARE
IMPORTANT.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRADE.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANY, MANY
THINGS.
BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL EXACTLY RIGHT
TO ME.
SO WE WILL BE OFFICIALLY
POSTPONING THE CONGRESSIONAL
PICNIC FOR TOMORROW.
WE'LL MAKE IT ANOTHER TIME WHEN
THINGS ARE GOING EXTREMELY WELL.
AND THEY ARE GOING FOR THE
COUNTRY EXTREMELY WELL.
WE HAVE RECORD SETTING NUMBERS
IN EVERY WAY ECONOMICALLY.
BUT WE WANT TO SOLVE THIS
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM WHICH IS
GOING ON FOR 40 YEARS, MORE.
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOREVER.
AND WE WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN
SOLVE IT.
SO WE ARE CANCELLING OR
POSTPONING THE CONGRESSIONAL
PICNIC TOMORROW.
WOULD ANYBODY IN THE ROOM HAVE
ANY QUESTION OR STATEMENT THAT
YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE WHILE THE
PRESS IS HERE.
ANYBODY?
>> MR. PRESIDENT, ON THE ISSUE
OF IMMIGRATION, TRADE, AND
INVESTMENT, THESE ARE ALL AREAS
WHERE CONGRESS HAS A LOT OF
AUTHORITY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION
AND YOU HAVE AUTHORITY, THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS AUTHORITY
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.
I THINK THAT'S WHY MEETINGS LIKE
THIS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
GETTING THE LEADERSHIP ON BOTH
SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE
IMPORTANT ISSUES SO APPRECIATE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET YOU SEE
OUR VIEWS AND HEAR OUR VIEWS ON
THESE ISSUES WHERE WE SHARE
AUTHORITY ON SOME IMPORTANT
MATTERS.
>> AND WE ALL VERY MUCH HAVE THE
SAME VIEWS.
WE WANT TO KEEP FAMILIES
TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME WE
HAVE TO BE STRONG ON THE BORDER.
OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE COMING UP, NOT
THOUSANDS LIKE WE HAVE NOW,
YOU'LL HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
FLOWING UP AND JUST OVERTAKING
THE COUNTRY.
WE'RE NOT LETTING THAT HAPPEN.
SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY STRONG ON
THE BORDER.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO
BE VERY COMPASSIONATE.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANKS FOR
HAVING US.
I THINK WHAT DAN SAID WAS GOOD.
WE REALLY ON THE ISSUES ON
TRADE, IMMIGRATION, WE HAVE A
PARTNERSHIP UNDER THE
CONSTITUTION.
WE HAVE SOME AUTHORITY, THE
PRESIDENT HAS SOME AUTHORITY, WE
NEED TO WORK TOGETHER.
I WAS THINKING THIS MORNING WHEN
WE LOOK AT PRESIDENT NIXON'S
PORTRAIT IN THE WHITE HOUSE WE
THINK THAT HE DID THE UNEXPECTED
AND HE WENT TO CHINA BECAUSE HE
COULD DO THAT HE WAS IN A
POSITION TO DO THAT AND
PRESIDENT REAGAN DID THE
UNEXPECTED HE WENT TO THE BERLIN
WALL IN MOSCOW.
I THINK I SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT
IMMIGRATION WHICH HAS BEDEVILLED
US FOR 40 YEARS AS YOU HAVE SAID
I BELIEVE YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT
WHO CAN HELP US SOLVE THE
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM WITH YOUR
LEADERSHIP.
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO FOR
IMMIGRATION WHAT NIXON DID FOR
CHINA AND REAGAN DID FOR THE
SOVIET UNION AND A LOT OF US
WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON
THAT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE NEED THE DEMOCRATS SUPPORT
BECAUSE WE NEED THEIR VOTES.
VERY SIMPLE.
PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE A MAJORITY.
WELL WE HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE
SENATE.
WE NEED 60 UNFORTUNATELY WE
DON'T GO WITH THE MAJORITY,
SOMEDAY SOMEBODY WILL EXPLAIN
WHY BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
WE NEED 60 VOTES.
WE HAVE 51 VOTES AT THE MOST.
SO WE NEED DEMOCRAT VOTES IN
ORDER TO DO IT OTHERWISE YOU
CAN'T DO IT.
TOM, YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?
>> I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
WE PROTECT OUR BORDER.
WE CANNOT ALLOW A CHILD TO BE A
GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AND A
GET INTO THE U.S. FREE TICKET.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU HAVE
SAID AND WE HAVE ALL SAID WE
WOULD LIKE TO KEEP FAMILIES
TOGETHER FOR THE ORDERLY AND
TIMING PROCESSING OF THE ADULT'S
CLAIM.
IF IT'S LAWFUL AND LEGIT MAT WE
CAN ADMIT THEM TO THE COUNTRY.
IF NOT THEY'LL HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY.
I KNOW WE IN CONGRESS ARE
WORKING ON LEGISLATION THAT WILL
ALLOW OUR HARD WORKING BORDER
PATROL AGENTS TO KEEP FAMILIES
TOGETHER AT THE BORDER WHILE WE
PROCESS THEIR CLAIM.
>> YOU BROUGHT UP SOMETHING I
HAVE TO SAY, BORDER PATROL
AGENTS AND OUR I.C.E.
AGENTS
HAVE DONE ONE GREAT JOB.
WE'RE THROWING BY THE THOUSANDS,
MS13 THEY COME INTO THE COUNTRY.
WE'RE LIBERATING TOWNS ON LONG
ISLAND AND OTHER PLACES.
WE'RE THROWING THEM OUT BY THE
THOUSANDS.
BUT WE NEED LAWS THAT DON'T
ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK IN.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THERE ARE A
NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS
TODAY THAT TOUCH ON COUNTRY'S
NATIONAL SECURITY.
AND CERTAINLY CONTROLLING WHO
AND WHAT COMES ACROSS OUR BORDER
IS AN ELEMENT OF NATIONAL
SECURITY.
AS WE DO THE COMPASSIONATE THING
WITH FAMILIES.
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH YOU TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN
OUR MILITARY.
TOGETHER WE HAVE TURNED AROUND A
DECLINING SITUATION.
BUT THAT'S ALSO PART OF WHAT WE
NEED TO DO TOGETHER BACK TO
LAMAR'S POINT ABOUT WE BOTH HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES WE CAN DO MORE
TOGETHER.
>> I WILL SAY WITH ALL OF THE
NUMBERS YOU SEE, IF WE WEREN'T
STRONG ON THE BORDER YOU WOULD
HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE POURING THROUGH THE
BORDER.
THEY WOULD JUST BE POURING
THROUGH AND THE COUNTRY WOULD
NOT BE THE COUNTRY ANYMORE.
>> WE HAVE A BIG MASSIVE MESS
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR
DECADES.
AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO FIX IT
ONE DAY I HOPE.
BUT WE HAVE A SPECIFIC PROBLEM
THAT PUTS THE COUNTRY IN A
DILEMMA.
IF A FAMILY SHOWS UP AT THE
BORDER AND WE LET THE FAMILY GO
INTO THE COUNTRY AND SAY PLEASE
COME BACK FOR YOUR HEARING ABOUT
80% OF THE TIME THE ADULTS NEVER
SHOW UP FOR THE HEARING.
I THINK MOST AMERICANS FEEL LIKE
THAT IS BAD, IT WILL CREATE A
THIRD WAVE OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
I WANT TO BE FAIR TO THE PEOPLE
WHO CAME UNDER THE SYSTEM BUT I
DON'T WANT TO CREATE A THIRD
WAVE.
THE OTHER CHOICE IS IF YOU
DETAIN THE PARENT WHO IS BROKE
THE LAW UNDER THE FLORES
DECISION YOU HAVE TO BREAK THE
FAMILY UP.
SO THERE'S A 1997 SPRING COURT
CASE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
SO I WOULD URGE MY DEMOCRATIC
FRIENDS TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND A
WAY TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER,
HAVE A LEGISLATIVE FIX OF THE
FLORES DECISION AND ARGUE ABOUT
THE OTHER THINGS LATER.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, MR. PRESIDENT
YOU'RE IN A REAL BIND, IF YOU
DETAIN THE ADULTS THE LAW
REQUIRES THE CHILDREN TO BE
SEPARATED.
IF YOU LET THE ADULTS INTO THE
COUNTRY THEY NEVER SHOW UP.
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WANT TO KEEP
THE FAMILY TOGETHER AND HAVE THE
PARENTS SHOW UP FOR THEIR DAY IN
COURT.
TO SENATOR SCHUMER, I KNOW
THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T AGREE ON
BUT SURELY TO GOODNESS WE CAN
FIX THIS COURT DECISION BECAUSE
THE COUNTRY IS NOT IN A BAD SPOT
NOT JUST YOU.
>> LINDSEY, THE DILEMMA IS THAT
IF YOU'RE WEAK, WHICH SOME
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE, IF
YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY
PATHETICALLY WEAK THE COUNTRY IS
GOING TO BE OVERRUN WITH
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
AND IF YOU'RE STRONG THEN YOU
DON'T HAVE ANY HEART.
THAT'S A TOUGH DILEMMA.
PERHAPS I'D RATHER BE STRONG BUT
THAT'S A TOUGH DILEMMA.
>> MR. PRESIDENT?
>> YES.
>> IN OUR COMMITTEE HOMELAND
SECURITY WE HAVE HELD 30
HEARINGS ON BORDER SECURITY.
AND SENATOR GRAHAM MENTIONED THE
FACT THAT WE HAVE THESE
INCENTIVES.
THERE'S NOTHING ENTICING PEOPLE
TO TAKE A DANGEROUS JOURNEY.
THERE'S NOTHING COMPASSIONATE
ABOUT THAT.
BUT HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE
2012.
JST TALKING ABOUT UNACCOMPANIED
CHILDREN.
PRIOR TO THAT SOME 2 OR 3,000
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN CAME
THROUGH CENTRAL AMERICA THEN
DACA WAS INSTITUTE AND HAD THAT
PROBLEM SKYROCKETING.
THE NUMBERS ABOUT 225,000
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN JUST FROM
SOUTH AMERICA.
ABOUT HALF A MILLION FAMILY
MEMBERS.
SO WE HAVE ANOTHER 750,000
INDIVIDUALS, VERY SYMPATHETIC
THAT WE'RE JUST INCENTIVIZING TO
COME IN.
WE HAVE TO STOP THOSE
INCENTIVES.
THE GOAL OF OUR POLICY SHOULD BE
TO REDUCE THE FLOW OF PEOPLE
INCENTIVIZED TO COME TO THIS
COUNTRY.
AND THAT'S WHAT STRONG
ENFORCEMENT DOES.
>> JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS
DEAL WAS JUST ABOUT DONE.
WE HAD A DEAL SIGNED.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED DACA.
WHAT HE SIGNED HE SAID I'M
REALLY NOT ALLOWED TO SIGN THIS
AND I'M GOING TO SIGN IT ANYWAY.
BUT HE ACTUALLY SAID I'M NOT
ALLOWED TO SIGN THIS, IT'S NEVER
GOING TO HOLD UP.
AND THEY GOT A JUDGE WHO HELD IT
UP, THEN ANOTHER ONE HELD IT UP,
THEN A COUPLE OF WHO TURNED IT
DOWN AND IT WILL BE A SUPREME
COURT ISSUE.
BUT BEFORE IT WAS HELD UP
EVERYONE ASSUMED THE DACA WOULD
NOT BE HELD UP AND WE HAD A DEAL
WITH THE DEMOCRATS.
IT WAS A DEAL THAT EVERYBODY
AGREED TO.
IT WAS $25 MILLION WE'RE GOING
TO BUILD A WALL, WE WOULD TAKE
CARE OF MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS INCLUDING LOOPHOLES.
IT WAS ALL DONE EXCEPT WHEN THIS
JUDGE RULED IN FAVOR OF DACA
MEANING THAT IT COULD CONTINUE
UNTIL WE GET TO THE SUPREME
COURT ALL O A SUDDEN THEY
WEREN'T THERE ANYMORE.
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THIS
MESS BECAUSE WE HAD A COUPLE OF
COURT DECISIONS WHICH IS GOING
TO FORCE AN ISSUE TO THE SUPREME
COURT THAT SHOULDN'T BE FORCED
TO THE SUPREME COURT.
>> THANKS FOR INVITING US UP ON
THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND FOR
HAVING THIS IMPORTANT
DISCUSSION.
CERTAINLY ON IMMIGRATION BUT
ALSO ON TRADE.
AND THE CONTEXT THAT I WANT TO
MAKE SURE WE TALK ABOUT IS WE
HAVE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS ON
TAX RELIEF AND REGULATORY
RELIEF.
AND IT'S REFLECTED IN OUR
ECONOMY.
NOW WE CAN DO THE SAME THING ON
TRADE.
THINK WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR
COUNTRY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC
GROWTH, IN TERMS OF JOBS, IN
TERMS OF GETTING WAGES MOVING
HIGHER.
AND THE IMPACT THAT HAS FOR ALL
AMERICANS.
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN THAT
CONTEXT.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRADE, IT'S
ON TOP OF TAX RELIEF, REGULATORY
RELIEF, AND NOW IF WE CAN GET
THE RIGHT POLICIES IN PLACE ON
TRADE THINK WHAT THAT MEANS FOR
OUR COUNTRY.
>> WE'RE DOING VERY WELL ON
TRADE I WILL SAY.
WE HAVE BEEN REALLY HURT AS A
COUNTRY ON TRADE FOR MANY YEARS.
DESPITE BAD TRADE DEALS WE'RE
REALLY WELL.
NOW WE'RE MAKING REALLY GOOD
TRADE DEALS.
THEY'LL BE ANNOUNCED PRETTY
RAPIDLY.
WE ALREADY HAVE A COUPLE THAT
ARE MADE.
BUT WE'RE MAKING GREAT TRADE
DEALS.
AND HONESTLY WE NEED PEOPLE
COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES
COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.
CHRYSLER JUST ANNOUNCED.
WE HAVE FOX CON IS GOING UP TO
WISCONSIN AS YOU KNOW.
AND THEY'RE A GREAT COMPANY THEY
MAKE THE APPLE iPHONES AND
LAPTOPS AND AN UNBELIEVABLE
COMPANY.
WE NEED PEOPLE.
WE NEED PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR
THESE COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY'RE
COMING IN AT A NUMBER NOBODY
EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.
SO WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO
OUR COUNTRY.
BUT I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR
EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE WE WANT
THEM TO COME IN BASED ON MERIT.
WE WANT GREAT PEOPLE THAT WILL
BE GREAT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
AND WE WANT THEM TO COME IN
BASED ON MERIT.
WE'RE GOING TO NEED THOSE PEOPLE
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY
COMPANIES COMING TO THE COUNTRY.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, TO YOUR POINT,
AMERICA IS THE MOST GENEROS
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHEN IT
COMES TO LEGAL IMMIGRATION.
I THINK WE OUGHT TO DRAW A VERY
CLEAR LINE BETWEEN LEGAL
IMMIGRATION THAT BENEFITS OUR
COUNTRY AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
WHICH IS A THREAT TO PUBLIC
SAFETY.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE ONE
POINT.
I AGREE WITH WHAT TOM COTTON AND
OTHERS HAVE SAID, WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ENFORCE THE
LAW AND KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER.
IT'S NOT A MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
CHOICE.
WE CAN DO BOTH.
AND I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.
BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT
THAT COMING FROM A BORDER STATE
LIKE MAC AND I DO THE ILLEGALITY
ALONG THE BORDER IS A COMPLEX
PROBLEM.
AS SOMEBODY POINTED OUT IT'S
COMMODITY AGNOSTIC, IT'S PEOPLE,
IT'S DRUGS, IT'S WEAPONS.
AND YOU TALK ABOUT AN OPIOID
PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES
IT'S NOT JUST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
IT'S OPIOID THAT DPROMS MEXICO.
WE NEED LAW AND ORDER ALONG THE
BORDER.
EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT, WE
NEED TO BE COMPASSIONATE THE WAY
WE HANDLE THESE FAMILIES.
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
THAT LARGER CONTEXT BECAUSE THE
CARTELS AND CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM
THIS.
THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY
AND KEEPING THIS SITUATION IS
VERY DANGEROUS FOR EVERYBODY
INVOLVED.
>> IN ALL WAYS THEY'RE USING THE
CHILDREN AS A TICKET TO GET INTO
THE COUNTRY.
AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.
THERE'S A NUMBER OF THE 12,000
CHILDREN, 2,000 WITH THE PARENTS
AND 10,000 CAME UP WITH SOME
REALLY HORRIBLE PEOPLE IN SOME
CASES.
YOU HAVE THE COYOTES, YOU HAVE
THE TRAFFICKERS, THE HUMAN
TRAFFICKERS.
NOT ONLY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BUT
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS.
AND THEY USE THESE CHILDREN AS
PASSPORTS TO GET INTO THE
COUNTRY.
SO WE HAVE TO WORK ON THAT TOO.
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE.
IT HAS BEEN GOING ON, YOU
SHOULDN'T FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY,
MANY YEARS, MANY, MANY DECADES.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THAT
ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER
PROBLEMS WE HAVE ALREADY SOLVED.
WE'RE DOING WELL AT SOLVING
PROBLEMS.
WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT WE HAD
NORTH KOREA.
WE HAD THE IRAN DEAL WHICH WAS
NO GOOD.
WE HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS WITH
TRADE AND BAD TRADE DEALS.
AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE
SOLVING THAT IN THEORY I
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO SOLVE.
THESE ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN SOLVEDOR A LONG TIME
EVEN ON TRADE.
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER ALLOWED OUR
PAST LEADERS, SHOULD HAVE NEVER
ALLOWED CHINA TO GET TO A POINT
WHERE THERE'S A $500 BILLION
TRADE DEFICIT WITH THE UNITED
STATES.
WHEN THEY WENT UP WE SHOULD HAVE
GONE UP.
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE UP TOGETHER.
AND THAT INCLUDES THE EUROPEAN
UNION AND MANY OTHERS.
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
SO WE CAME AT A TIME WHERE THERE
WERE PLENTY OF PROBLEMS TO
SOLVE.
AND ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IS
IMMIGRATION.
AND I HOPE WITHIN NOT TOO LONG
DISTANCE AND I MEAN BEYOND THIS
ONE PROBLEM OF IMMIGRATION YOU
CAN MENTION THE WORD
COMPREHENSIVE OR YOU DON'T HAVE
TO USE IT.
A LOT OF POLITICIANS DON'T LIKE
THE WORD COMPREHENSIVE
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE WHOLE
IMMIGRATION PICTURE AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M LOOKING TO DO
ULTIMATELY.
BUT RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO FIX
THIS PROBLEM.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE LAST YEAR
AND A HALF HAS SHOWN AN ABSOLUTE
TURN AROUND IN THIS ECONOMY.
I MEAN WE WERE FACED WITH EIGHT
YEARS OF 1.9% ECONOMIC GROWTH.
WE FOCUSSED ON AS JOHN SAID
REGULATION AND TAXES.
THIS YEAR WE PUT A DODD-FRANK
BILL A BIPARTISAN BILL.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS FREED UP
$6 TRILLION TO GO BACK INTO THE
ECONOMY.
THIS IS REAL JOBS.
3.5 MILLION NEW JOBS.
870 REGULATIONS.
THIS ECONOMY IS MOVING.
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS PAYING
ATTENTION.
NATO HAS DOUBLED THEIR
INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF MILITARY
SPENDING.
WE HAVE A NEW FREE TRADE
AGREEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA.
I JUST HOPE WE CAN FOCUS ON THE
PRIORITIES WITHIN THIS TRADE
AGREEMENT TO GET EQUAL ACCESS.
IT'S NO A RIGHT WHEN ALIBABA CAN
DO CLOUD COMPUTING AND GOOGLE
CAN'T DO IT IN CHINA.
WE HAVE REDUCED BY 2/3 IN THE
LAST 30 YEARS WHILE POVERTY IN
THE UNITED STATES HAS REMAINED
FLAT.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND THIS IS
MOVING TO CHANGE THAT.
>> I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT
YOU CALL ATTENTION TO WHAT'S
REALLY HAPPENING NOW WITH THE
ECONOMY DUE TO TWO THINGS.
THE TAX BILL AND THE
REGULATIONS.
YOU KNOW WE WERE KILLING PEOPLE
WITH THE REGULATIONS.
BUT WHAT HASN'T BEEN SAID AROUND
THIS TABLE AND I'M SURPRISED THE
BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENT FROM YOUR
ADMINISTRATION IS WHAT YOU HAVE
DONE WITH THE MILITARY.
YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED A POLICY THAT
SAID YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING IN
SECRET WITH THE MILITARY UNLESS
YOU DO IT WITH THE DEFENSE.
WE HAD TO VOTE FOR A LOUSY
BUDGET BILL TO DO IT BUT
NONETHELESS IT IS CHANGED.
WE'RE NOW REBUILDING OUR
MILITARY.
>> THE MILITARY IS REALLY
INCREDIBLE.
WE'RE ORDERING NEW PLANES, NEW
SHIPS, ALL JOBS TOO.
JOBS I WOULD SAY IN THIS CASE IS
A FAR SECOND BUT WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A MILITARY LIKE WE HAVE
NEVER HAD BEFORE AND IT'S GREAT.
700 BILLION APPROVED.
AND IN THAT BUDGET 6 BILLION FOR
OPIOID.
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TOO.
SO A LOT OF PROGRESS IS BEING
MADE.
MIKE,DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO
SAY?
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
I KNOW I SPEAK FOR THE PRESIDENT
WHEN I EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE OF
THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR THE
SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE
SENATE AND THE HOUSE THAT ARE
GATHERED AROUND HERE.
YOU HAVE DELIVERED FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ON NATIONAL
SECURITY, REBUILDING OUR
MILITARY, ON TAX CUTS AND
REGULATORY REFORM, RESTORING OUR
ECONOMY.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT REITERATED
AGAIN YESTERDAY AND HE HAS SAID
EVERYDAY FROM WHEN HE SOUGHT
THIS OFFICE IS WE HAVE A CRISIS
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
AND AS THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR
WE DON'T WANT FAMILIES TO BE
SEPARATED.
WE DON'T WANT CHILDREN TAKEN
AWAY FROM PARENTS.
BUT RIGHT NOW UNDER THE LAW AND
WE SIT WITH THESE LAWMAKERS WE
ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES BEFORE US.
NUMBER ONE IS DON'T PROSECUTE
PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY
ILLEGALLY, OR PROSECUTE THEM AND
THEN UNDER COURT CASES AND THE
LAW THEY HAVE TO BE SEPARATED
FROM THEIR CHILDREN.
WHAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT IS
WE'RE CALLING ON THESE
LAWMAKERS, MR. PRESIDENT NOT
ONLY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN A
WAY THAT CONFIRMS OUR COMMITMENT
TO LAW AND ORDER AND COMPASSION
WHICH WE CAN DO AND THERE ARE
PROPOSALS IN THE SENATE AND
HOUSE TO DO THAT.
BUT THE PRESIDENT'S VISION
ARTICULATED IN HIS STATE OF THE
UNION ADDRESS WAS LET'S SOLVE
THE WHOLE PROBLEM.
LET'S BUILD A WALL, LET'S CLOSE
THE LOOPHOLES, LET'S SOLVE THE
PROBLEM FOR 1.8 BILLION PEOPLE
BROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN,
AND LET'S DEAL WITH LAW AND
ORDER AND COMPASSION WITH THIS
ISSUE OF FAMILY SEPARATION AT
OUR BORDERS.
AND I WOULD SAY WITH GREAT
RESPECT TO THE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS AS THE HOUSE CONSIDERS
LEGISLATION TOMORROW, THE SENATE
IS CONSIDERING LEGISLATION, AND
THE PRESIDENT HAS POSTPONED THE
CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC.
WE'RE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO
ACT.
LET'S ROLL OUR SHE WAS UP, LET'S
WORK THE WHOLE PROBLEM LET'S END
THIS PROCESS OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
TO SAY?
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU.
AND JUST FROM THE HOUSE
PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO SAY THERE
IS BEEN A MARKED DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND THE
GOOD FEELINGS IN THE MILITARY.
THEY UNDERSTAND WE'RE INVESTING
IN THEM AGAIN EVEN THOUGH WE'RE
ASKING THEM TO DO A LOT.
AND SECONDLY SECURITY PLAYS A
BIG ROLE.
AND THAT INCLUDES BORDER
SECURITY.
AND THE BILL WE'LL BRING UP AND
PASS IN THE HOUSE THIS WEEK
FULLY FUNDS THE BORDER AND TAKES
CARE OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES.
I WISH DEMOCRATS WOULD JOIN US
BECAUSE FRANKLY IT'S A LOT OF
STUFF THEY LIKE TOO.
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THEY LIKE
THE POLITICS OF THIS A LITTLE
BETTER.
AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY WE REALLY
WISH YOU DIDN'T TAKE SECRETARY
POMPEO FROM THE HOUSE BUT HE'S
DOING A GREAT JOB.
>> HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
I WANT TO ECHO PARTICULARLY IN
THE TERMS OF CHANGE WE HAVE SEEN
IN TERMS OF RESOURCES FOR THE
MILITARY.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T
HAVE ANOTHER CR FROM THE
MILITARY.
AND WE ARE WORKING HARD IN THE
HOUSE.
WE'RE HOPEFUL GOING TO PASS
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL NEXT
WEEK IN THE HOUSE.
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT GETS TAKEN UP AND PASSED IN
THE SENATE AND THAT WE GET A
STRAIGHT DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
BILL PASSED AND THAT WILL BE
IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE WHAT YOU
HAVE DONE TO REBUILD THE
MILITARY.
>> THANK YOU.
AND SAY HELLO TO YOUR FATHER
PLEASE, GREAT GUY.
SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
WE ARE WE'RE LOOKING TO KEEP
FAMILIES TOGETHER.
VERY IMPORTANT.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SIGNING AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER.
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO COUNT ON
CONGRESS OBVIOUSLY.
BUT WE ARE SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE
ORDER IN A LITTLE WHILE.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FAMILIES
TOGETHER BUT WE STILL HAVE TO
MAINTAIN TOUGHNESS OR OUR
COUNTRY WILL BE OVERRUN BY
PEOPLE, BY CRIME, BY ALL OF THE
THINGS THAT WE DON'T STAND FOR
THAT WE DON'T WANT.
SO I'M GOING TO BE SIGNING AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER IN A LITTLE
WHILE BEFORE I GO TO MINNESOTA.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK YOU
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE'RE KEEPING
FAMILIES TOGETHER BUT WE HAVE TO
KEEP OUR BORDERS STRONG.
WE WILL BE OVERRUN WITH CRIME
AND WITH PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NOT
BE IN OUR COUNTRY.
>> WILL YOU HAVE A STAND ALONE
BILL ADDRESSING THE FAMILY
SEPARATION ISSUE?
>> WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
>> DID THE IMAGES OF THE YOUNG
CHILDREN AT THE BORDER --
>> THOSE IMAGES EFFECT
EVERYBODY.
BUT I HAVE TO SAY YOU HAVE
DOUBLE STANDARDS.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT
ABSOLUTE SECURITY AND SAFETY AND
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT DO LOOK AT
THE CHILDREN AND THEN YOU HAVE
PEOPLE LIKE ME AND I THINK MOST
OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT
WANT BOTH.
WE WANT STRONG BORDERS AND WE
WANT NO CRIME.
WE DON'T WANT CRIME IN THIS
COUNTRY.
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN.
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST THROUGH OUR
BORDER USING CHILDREN TO GET
THROUGH THE LINES.
WE DON'T WANT THAT.
WE DID TOO GOOD A JOB TO ALLOW
THAT TO HAPPEN.
SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT
TO HAPPEN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR
50 YEARS, LONGER.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON UNDER
PRESIDENT OBAMA, UNDER PRESIDENT
BUSH.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY,
MANY YEARS.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN
SOLVE IT.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT
HAPPENED JUST NOW.
YOU LOOK AT THE IMAGES
FROM 2014.
I WAS WATCHING THIS MORNING.
AND THEY WERE SHOWING IMAGES
FROM 2014.
THEY BLOW AWAY WHAT WE'RE
LOOKING AT TODAY.
AND THAT WAS NOT DURING THIS,
THAT WAS DURING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
I SAW IMAGES THAT WERE HORRIBLE.
AND YOU KNOW THE ONES I'M
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I'M SURE
YOU ALL SAW THEM TOO.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN
SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM.
LIKE WE HAVE SOLVED SO MANY
OTHER PROBLEMS AND I THINK WE'LL
GET IT DONE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
.
>> THERE YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT
SAYING THAT HE WILL BE SIGNING
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WILL
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SECURITY AT
THE BORDER AS WELL AS THE
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES AT THE
BORDER.
I WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO MAJOR
GARRET AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
MAJOR, FOR DAYS NOW THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING IT'S
UP TO THE DEMOCRATS TO DO
SOMETHING IF YOU WANT TO STOP
THE SEPARATION AT THE BORDER.
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT BECAUSE
HE'S ABOUT TO SIGN AN EXECUTIVE
ORDER.
WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THIS.
>> THE WORD FROM THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL THIS WEEK, FROM THE
HOMELAND SECURITIES SECRETARY,
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND THOSE
WHO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE WHITE
HOUSE.
THE LAW IS THE LAW YOU HAVE TO
ENFORCE THE LAW, WE HAVE NO
CHOICE, OUR OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.
NO THEY'RE NOT LIMITED ACTUALLY.
YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO SOLVE THIS
BECAUSE IN FACT, AND THIS IS AN
UNDISPUTED FACT, THIS
ADMINISTRATION DECIDED WITH ITS
0 TOLERANCE POLICY TO PROSECUTE
EVERYONE CROSSING THE BORDER.
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A 1997
SUPREME COURT DECISION IN THE
FLORES CASE THAT REQUIRED
PARENTS TO BE SEPARATED FROM
THEIR CHILDREN OR ADULTS TO BE
SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN
ACCOMPANYING THEM WHETHER THEY
WERE THEIR CHILDREN OR NOT.
OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE FACED
THIS SIMILAR DILEMMA.
AND IN CERTAIN RESPECTS THE
OBAMA AND BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS
ON A LIMITED BASIS SEPARATED
FAMILIES.
BUT WHEN THIS ADMINISTRATION
ASSERTED AND ENFORCED A 0
TOLERANCE POLICY IT SET THIS
SITUATION PLAYING OUT ON THE
SOUTHERN BORDER RIGHT NOW IN
MOTION.
THAT HAS BECOME A POLITICAL
CRISIS FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE
HOUSE AND SENATE.
IT HAS BECOME AN OPTICS CRISIS
FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE FORCING THE
PRESIDENT FOR THE VERY FIRST
TIME IN HIS PRESIDENCY TO
REVERSE HIMSELF ON AN ISSUE IN
WHICH HE HAS BEEN BOTH
ENTRENCHED AND RESOLUTE, BORDER
SECURITY.
IS IT A HUGE REVERSAL?
NO.
BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING BUT THAT
EVEN IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND
WITH THIS PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN
SO AGGRESSIVE ON IMMIGRATION,
EVEN THESE POLITICS WERE TOO
MUCH FOR HIM TO BEAR WITHOUT
CHANGING HIS APPROACH.
AND THE CHANGED APPROACH IS BY
HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER HE WILL KEEP
FAMILIES TOGETHER.
AND THAT IS SOMETHING HE WILL DO
TEMPORARILY AWAITING ACTION FROM
CONGRESS.
AND HE INDICATED AT THE VERY
TAIL END OF THAT QUESTION AND
ANSWER SESSION THAT HE MIGHT
SIGN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT
ONLY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE.
NOT ALL OF THE OTHER IMMIGRATION
PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED BY THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
THAT'S WHAT TO WATCH.
IF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS GET
TOGETHER ON THIS FAMILY
SEPARATION ISSUE AND PUT A
SINGULAR NARROW PIECE OF
LEGISLATION ON THE PRESIDENT'S
DESK WILL HE SIGN IT, AND WILL
HE SIGN IT KNOWING IN SO DOING
HE WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING ELSE ON
IMMIGRATION THE REMAINDER OF
THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR.
THAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION OF THIS
WHITE HOUSE.
>> I WANT TO BRING IN PAULA REED
OUR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM YOUR
SOURCES?
>> I'M TOLD SINCE ABOUT 7:00
THIS MORNING JUSTICE OFFICIALS
INCLUDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
JEFF SESSIONS HAVE BEEN HUDDLED
AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
WORKING ON THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER.
AND I'M TOLD THIS EXECUTIVE
ORDER WILL CERTAINLY NOT END THE
POLICY OF 0 TOLERANCE.
THEY WILL STILL AIM TO PROSECUTE
EVERYONE WHO CROSSES THE BORDER
ILLEGALLY.
BUT DURING THE PROCESS OF
DEPORTATION AND PROSECUTION THIS
WILL ALLOW FAMILIES TO BE HELD
TOGETHER.
THEY ARE EXPECTING SOME LEGAL
CHALLENGES TO THIS UNDER THE
FLORES CASE.
BUT THEY ARE CONFIDENT THE
PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE POWER WILL
PREVAIL ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE WELFARE AND
SAFETY OF CHILDREN AT THE
BORDER.
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
ALL DAY AND EVEN THOUGH JEFF
SESSIONS IMPLEMENTED THE 0
TOLERANCE POLICY AND HAS BEEN
THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE
ADMINISTRATION IN HIS OWNERSHIP
AND COMMITMENT TO THAT AND THE
FACT THAT IT IS A DETERRENT HE
WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER TODAY.
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT THE FLORES DECISION
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT, BECAUSE THEY ARE
ARRESTING PEOPLE AT THE BORDER
THAT IS WHY THE CHILDREN HAVE
BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR
PARENTS.
THE FLORES DECISION INDICATES
YOU CAN'T HOLD CHILDREN FOR MORE
THAN 20 DAYS.
>> EXACTLY.
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WILL BE
DIFFICULT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION
TO GET AROUND?
>> NOT NECESSARILY.
BECAUSE YOU CAN HANDLE
IMMIGRATION TWO WAYS.
YOU CAN HANDLE IT AS A CIVIL
MATTER OR PROSECUTE EVERYONE WHO
COMES ACROSS THE BORDER
ILLEGALLY.
AND BEFORE THE 0 TOLERANCE
POLICY THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD
DISCRETION IF THEY ENCOUNTERED
SOMEONE THEY BELIEVED WAS PART
OF SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATION OR WAS A CRIMINAL
THEY COULD OPT TO PROSECUTE THAT
PERSON OR NOT.
OR THEY COULD RELEASE THOSE
PEOPLE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND
GIVE THEM A COURT DATE WHICH
STATISTICALLY MANY PEOPLE NEVER
SHOWED UP FOR.
SO HERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
SAID WE'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO CROSSES
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY.
IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE
YOU MUST DETAIN THEM AND BECAUSE
D
FOR CRIMES THAT IS PART OF WHY
MANY FAMILIES HAD TO BE
SEPARATED WHICH LED TO THIS
CISIS.
AN EXECUTIVE SEEMS TO BE THE
ONLY LEGAL AND POLITICALLY
VIABLE SOLUTION TO THE SITUATION
THAT THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES
IN.
OF COURSE THEY COULD REVERSE ON
0 TOLERANCE BUT I AM TOLD THAT
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS
ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING TO DO THAT
WHICH LEAVES THEM WITH AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER WORK AROUND.
WE'LL SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT OUT
IN THE FIELD AND IN THE COURTS.
>>> MAJOR GARRET IS STANDING BY
STILL.
>> SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BASED ON WHAT PAULA
JUST SAID AND WHAT THE
PRESIDENTS REMARKS SAID
THROUGHOUT THAT 25-MINUTE
SESSION WITH HOUSE AND SENATE
REPUBLICANS.
REPEATEDLY HE REFERRED TO PEOPLE
COMING ACROSS THE BORDER AS
CRIMINALS AND SMUGGLERS.
THIS LAW ASSUMES THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE CROSSING THE BORDER
WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION YOU'RE
PROBABLY A CRIMINAL NOT JUST
SOMEONE TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT OR
FOR SOME OTHER REASON THAT WAS
VIEWED BY PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATIONS AS LARGELY
BENIGN.
SO IF EVERYONE IS A CRIMINAL
THEN EVERYONE MUST BE
PROSECUTED.
AND THAT IS WHAT'S NEW.
THE ASSUMPTION CARRIED OUT BY
THE GOVERNMENT THAT IF YOU'RE
OUT THE BORDER WITHOUT
DOCUMENTATION YOU MUST BE A
CRIMINAL OF SOME KIND, A DRUG
SMUGGLER, A HUMAN TRAFFICKER,
SOMETHING REALLY BAD.
THE PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE
CONTINUES TO CONFLATE IS AND USE
SYMBOLIC ADJECTIVES OF
DESCRIBING THOSE COMING ACROSS
THE BORDER AS CRIMINAL INTENT.
THAT ASSUMPTION LIES BEHIND THIS
NEW 0 TOLERANCE POLICY.
YOU CAN CHANGE THAT ASSUMPTION.
YOU CAN USE THE ASSUMPTION
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS DID IT
LOOKED FOR EVIDENCE OF HUMAN
TRAFFICKING OR DRUGS.
AND IF THEY COULDN'T FIND IT
WOULD ESSENTIALLY TREAT PEOPLE
CROSSING THE BORDER AS SOMETHING
AKIN TO A TRAFFIC VIOLATION.
GIVE THEM A CITATION AND ASK
THEM TO COME BACK TO A COURT
DATE.
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION MADE THE
DECISION TO ASSUME AND ASSERT
THROUGH THE LAW EVERYONE
CROSSING IS A CRIMINAL AND MUST
BE PROSECUTED.
THAT'S WHEN THE FLORES DECISION
CAME INTO PLAY.
SO YES THIS ADMINISTRATION FOUND
ITSELF IN THIS SITUATION.
THIS ADMINISTRATION ALSO PUT
ITSELF IN THIS SITUATION.
>> MAJOR, THAT'S THE POINT THAT
I WANT TO DRILL DOWN NO.
BEING A DIGITAL NETWORK WE GET A
LOT OF FEEDBACK IN REALTIME FROM
PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
THE PRESIDENT IN THE COMMENTS HE
MADE THERE HE AGAIN POINTED OUT
PEOPLE COMING FROM THE MIDDLE
EAST, HE DIDN'T SAY TERRORISTS,
HE JUST SAID PEOPLE FROM THE
MIDDLE EAST.
THE LANGUAGE THE PRESIDENT USED
IN A TWEET YESTERDAY HE USED THE
WORD NO MATTER HOW BAD THEY MAY
BE TO POUR INTO AND INFEST.
INFEST OUR COUNTRY LIKE MS13.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID
INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT MANY OF
THESE POLICIES BEGAN UNDER
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
IF YOU RECALL, YOU COVERED THE
OBAMA PRESIDENCY, THEY USED TO
CALL BARACK OBAMA THE DEPORTER
IN CHIEF.
I WANT YOU TO HIGHLIGHT THE
POINT YOU WERE MAKING THERE BUT
EVEN WITH MORE CLARITY IF
POSSIBLE THAT THE POLICIES THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTED
DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE
VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN THIS 0
TOLERANCE POLICY THAT THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
HAS IMPLEMENTED WITH THIS 0
TOLERANCE POLICY.
JUST BREAK THAT DOWN ONE LAST
TIME FOR OUR VIEWERS.
>> SURE AND I CAN'T GIVE
EVERYONE MY NEW CHAPTER AND
VERSE ON THIS BECAUSE I CAN ONLY
WORK OFF MY IMPROPER MEMORY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT NATIONAL
GUARD THERE, AND SENT A MESSAGE
IN THE LIMITED CASES WHERE
FAMILIES WERE SEPARATED WITH
CHILDREN TRAVELING WITH THEM
DON'T COME TO THE BORDER.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID SOME OF THE
SAME WORDS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS SAID IN THIS CONTEXT.
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH ALSO
HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
BECAUSE THERE ARE SEASONAL
SURGES AT THE BORDER OF ILLEGAL
CROSSERS, THOSE WITHOUT
DOCUMENTATION.
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT
TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS
CONTEXT TO THINK ABOUT WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LAST SPRING
WHEN WE WERE HAVING THIS
CONVERSATION ABOUT IMMIGRATION
THIS WHITE HOUSE WAS TRUMPENING
THE FACT THAT ILLEGAL BORDER
CROSSINGS WERE WAY DOWN.
NOW THIS YEAR THEY HAVE SEEN AN
INCREASE.
NOT AN INCREASE OF HISTORICAL
SIZE MEANING SO MUCH LARGER THAN
WE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE.
BUT LARGE IN RELATION TO THE
DECREASE LAST YEAR.
THAT CREATED A SENSE OF
POLITICAL PANIC WITHIN THIS
WHITE HOUSE.
WHY?
BECAUSE ITS HARD CORE BASE THAT
WANTED STRONG BORDER SECURITY
WAS GETTING RESTIVE ABOUT THE
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT HADN'T
SECURED MONEY FOR THE BORDER
WALL AND WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF THIS PRESIDENT WAS GETTING
WEAK ON IMMIGRATION.
IN APRIL THIS ADMINISTRATION
MADE THE 0 TOLERANCE POLICY
ANNOUNCEMENT.
AND IT HAD TO KNOW, IF IT DIDN'T
KNOW IT WAS AN ACT OF POLITICAL
AND PROCEDURAL MALPRACTICE NOT
TO KNOW THAT THIS WOULD BE THE
INEVITABLE RESULT, SEPARATING
FAMILIES MEANING PARENTS FROM
THEIR CHILDREN AND ADULTS FROM
THEIR ACCOMPANIED MINORS
TRAVELING WITH THEM.
NOW THERE ARE ISSUES INVOLVED AS
PAULA IDENTIFIED THERE ARE
LOOPHOLES AND WAYS IN WHICH
PEOPLE WHO SEEK ASYLUM OR
SMUGGLERS LEARN THE CATCH
PHRASES AND HAVE FOUND A WAY TO
SKIRT THE SYSTEM.
THAT'S NOT UNTRUE.
THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THIS THAT
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WHO
ARE REALLY VERSED ON THIS ISSUE
UNDERSTAND AND WOULD LIKE TO
SOLVE.
THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU
INTRODUCE ONE IMMIGRATION ISSUE
ON CAPITOL HILL ALL OF THE OTHER
ISSUES THEREFORE FOLLOW.
AND IT'S BEEN THE INABILITY TO
ACHIEVE BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS ON
ANY MORE THAN ONE ISSUE THAT HAS
KEPT THIS ISSUE STALLED.
IF THE PRESIDENT WILL SOLVE THIS
ONE ISSUE THAT WILL BE A CHOICE
TO MAKE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS.
>> MAJOR AND PAULA STAND BY.
I WANT TO BRING IN NANCY CORTIS.
SHE'S BEEN GETTING REACTION FROM
THE HILL.
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?
>> FOR DAYS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
TO REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WHO
SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN
CHANGE THIS SITUATION WITH A
STROKE OF THE PEN.
NOW THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE STROKE OF A
