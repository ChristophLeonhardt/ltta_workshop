1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,250
oh

2
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,100
oh

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,180
This is Muriwai Beach in New Zealand

4
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,409
This is a sheep and this is gandalf

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,389
Most people come to new zealand to check out the country's unmatched beauty and to get their middle-earth fix and that makes perfect sense

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,379
But on this trip. I'm hunting for something else

7
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,120
something less obvious

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,220
I'm after the innovations being brought to life behind these doors

9
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,518
in these buildings and

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
in this studio

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:03,870
I'm heading out on a 400 mile journey across new Zealand's, North Island from Auckland to Wellington to find the most breathtaking

12
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,050
Inventions these kiwis have cooked up. You said it wasn't gonna be Friday. This is the first one that's going to go on yep

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,320
The computer model has just become conscious of something on this episode of how the world will check out a mad scientist

14
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,300
some [Rockets]

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,889
And an AI baby hi, baby, I'll either warm your heart

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,460
Or leave you weeping over humanity's grim future

17
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,758
Silicon Valley may be home to some of the biggest tech giants in the world, but it's being challenged like [never] before

18
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,089
Crazy Tech geniuses have popped up all over the planet making things that will blow your mind

19
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:54,540
My name is Ashley vance. I'm an author and journalist and I'm on a quest to [find] the most innovative Tech creations and

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,710
Meet the beautiful freaks behind them hello world

21
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,540
oh

22
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,270
Hello, Sky [Fellas]

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
This is auckland

24
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,970
The home to 1.5 million of New Zealand's 4.5 million people

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,129
People living outside of Oakland 10 Tanaka Des congested and hectic

26
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,999
Meanwhile people living in auckland celebrate the way of life it offers. [I] [guess] that a lot of place everybody's going [to] go to

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,940
The City has a bustling food scene

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,739
There's a gorgeous harbour surrounded by fertile volcanic land and those gannets and black sand beaches you saw earlier

29
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,069
There just a half hour drive from downtown

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,589
This next [parts] gonna sound cheesy but honest to God, it's true

31
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,809
Auckland is full of cheery uptil mystic people to feel good when you're here like you can do stuff big stuff

32
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,529
crazy stuff like say replicating human consciousness on the inside of a computer

33
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,518
Face it's our primary means of communication

34
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,829
Yeah

35
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,419
But it's been untapped in terms of a human-computer interface

36
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,890
here

37
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:33,289
Dr.. Peter can Express itself to you in a human-like way, which is emotional that's cognitive, no

38
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,849
That's when you start getting to [this] sort of interesting place. Go on a cai, baby

39
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,989
on a sunny afternoon

40
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:54,459
The fellow you meet next is a Madman in the best possible way [Gonna] pull the muscles which basically lower the brow

41
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:58,419
He's Mike sager a computer scientist at the University of Auckland

42
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,609
So nice [rain] [clem] would be yesterday's [wanker], and she's noise up

43
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,968
mark became famous for building super detailed simulations of the human body and

44
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:16,538
ended up winning a couple of oscars for his work on films like avatar and King Kong sorry stay here and

45
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,269
These days mark is how to put this?

46
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,059
trying to reverse engineer the human brain

47
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:32,620
He's built a series of simulations around how the human face moves how we express emotion and how our neurons fire?

48
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,639
we're trying to build a computer which has

49
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
experiences can IMagine and

50
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,029
Basically it has its own sort of existence in a way. So now what we're gonna do is I'm going to run baby s

51
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,919
What we're building here is a computer that can learn

52
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
So this is baby

53
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,190
Please sort of looking at us and hearing us if I make a loud noise

54
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:00,698
And I should get a fright. This is what she can see so you can see my face here a through that [eye]

55
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,409
so she's not

56
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:04,389
Copying my smile

57
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,679
She's responding to me and now this is her little fist baby's fist weird book

58
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,270
So you can pick a bigger page in a show or something, but she has to be looking at it's a get her attention

59
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,789
Hi, baby, hi, hi

60
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,250
Hi, what do you see?

61
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,159
What's this?

62
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,669
Puppy very good. What's that baby?

63
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,239
This is cuz we're new zealand you [gotta] show your shape. Yeah, I'll give her the word yeah. Yeah, hi baby, hi

64
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,849
What do you see, baby?

65
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,429
Sheep very good, baby

66
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,949
the long-term goals is can we create a

67
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,210
Computational model of consciousness because then you get go okay the computer model has just become conscious of something is that thought on

68
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,240
Now all the facial expressions everything is driven by neural nets so as we look [around]

69
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,069
I'm going [at] his nails remove her face basically and so this is what's driving in the background

70
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:05,289
And so what you're looking at now these are all the connections lighting out right as the baby's doing stuff

71
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,399
And this is like a simulation of what [would] you have an ingress in this brain?

72
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,780
Yeah, because if you're going to make a character biological and behave naturally then you've got to use a natural model

73
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,820
so this is sort of what's going on inside baby X

74
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:33,600
Now we take this stuff, and we [a] now connect it to cognitive computing systems. So you've got

75
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,100
Biological Neural Networks connected to artificial intelligence models and the potential for that's enormous

76
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,789
That's where the future is probably going to be

77
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,270
There's a term new zealanders have for possessed inventor types like [Mark]

78
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:57,489
They're part of the country's number 8 wire culture like so many things here the story of number 8 wire goes back to those sheep

79
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,689
Farmers used to make their fences out of [eight] wire gauge metal

80
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:08,199
Then they started to use the wire to fix just about any problem on the farm over time a number 8 wire

81
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:13,688
mythology evolved to capture the Can-do spirit of people living in a remote place and

82
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:17,439
other people who had to solve problems in any clever way they could

83
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,549
But while new zealanders remain fond of the 8 wire idea there's an undeniable sense that the country [is] ready to level up

84
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,659
It's time to start inventing with more purpose and polish

85
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,650
the Gritty Garage Workshop is giving way to this a

86
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,319
Pristine mad scientist's Lab that looks like it could be for sale [in] an apple [store]

87
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:45,128
[Sarey] avery embodies kiwi ingenuity

88
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:52,059
He's a prolific scientist and inventor sir avery this is Ashley vance

89
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:59,050
He made a fortune in the pharmaceutical industry and then decided to dedicate his life to helping the world's poorest people

90
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,919
Hence the sir all right this way so cool house all right. It's a to the Magic wardrobe I

91
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:12,729
Followed sir avery through a [wardrobe] door into his garage slash lab where he creates his objects I?

92
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,159
Knows everything of the houses. [why] did you're wearing white yeah? Yeah? Yeah, I mean, [I'm] a bit like Steve jobs

93
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,439
I have two dresses. I have black for winter and white for summer the thing is that I know that I've got

94
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,628
4,795 days left to live how do you know that well because I've done the algorithm

95
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,129
Analysis of somebody my age born in my time how much Chardonnay are drains all that sort of so

96
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,309
I know what I'm going to do with the next ten years of my [life] failure is

97
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,269
Really just for people are unprepared you don't waste time on

98
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,049
Things that aren't going to get you to where you need to go in things like clothes

99
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,249
Sir avery is well known for taking complicated medical devices and making them simple cheap and durable

100
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:03,349
Did you make this in here? Yeah? Yeah, this is your workshop lab, okay? Currently he's working on this incubator

101
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,859
It really is a life apart because it's almost like you know something that

102
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,430
Superman would be

103
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:17,419
Happy to be in and the shape of it is really much more about getting even air distribution and trying to make it look all

104
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,829
The life Pod costs

105
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:21,329
$2,000 versus

106
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:25,939
$40,000 for typical incubators the hope is that it could save thousands of lives each year

107
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,829
I'll tell you this is really cold. This is oh my God, [okay]

108
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:37,039
[so] free pretty pretty ugly he also has this giant block of frozen chicken slurry as a way to amplify the

109
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,089
nutritional value of trash meat, that's after Kentucky fried

110
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:49,039
Have taken all their bits the legs and the chest mate make it into this stuff mmM chicken slurry just have a spoonful that later

111
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,239
Sir a remixes the trash meet with of all things kiwi this breaks it down into the basic amino acids

112
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,789
So your body can absorb the nutrients more easily

113
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,709
It's aimed at helping malnourished children if you take that then you're going to get instant energy

114
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:08,809
You don't need to digest it. Go straight across [your] gut this will save millions and millions of kids lives

115
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,049
you know Einstein said the most elegant solution is always the most simplest and

116
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,740
Kiwis have that a very practical way of doing things

117
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
if you take away

118
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,419
the noise that you have often with things like silicon Valley and just have a bunch of guys in sheds for the lathe and a

119
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,390
Few bits and pieces they come up with stuff that nobody able to thought off

120
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Coming up. We'll take a look at rockets. This is a dream come true. I've always wanted to be in the back

121
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,949
Then I cheap that I'm hoping that I live after this relaxing afternoon

122
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,670
one of New Zealand's Most Adventurous

123
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:59,719
and affable inventors is a Scottish import named Richard little we know there's probably about five million people around the world that could benefit from

124
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,860
Using the rakes he's one of two engineers who started Rex Bionics

125
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,929
My best friend was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and like the need to use a wheelchair in his future I

126
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,410
Said why don't we build your robot legs?

127
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,939
So we spend four years in the garage, and we actually got something working [it] [could] [sit] [in] [the] could stand and it could walk

128
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,029
We knew then we would be able to do this

129
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,799
So the thing you'll notice with the rex of course right away is itself support

130
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,879
and

131
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,449
It's the only device of its kind like that because of that most of the people who use rex or spinal cord injured

132
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:51,799
Although it can be any mobility impairment if you stand in it

133
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,619
If you push the Joystick forward and let it go

134
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,350
Will take one step and stop if you keep holding it forward? I'll keep moving forward okay. What is the red button?

135
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,129
Do that's the emergency scale so if it all turns the custard press the red button, okay?

136
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,319
So if you push it forward and let it go, that's it. You're going to lean to that site, okay well

137
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:17,659
It's crazy. I mean you really don't have to put it [Eddy]. You don't do anything. Yeah

138
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
Going to be Michael Jackson impression

139
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,560
This is jared

140
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,560
He lost the use of his legs in a car accident [ten] years ago, and is now a [wrecks] employee

141
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,789
Customer and test driver. How long would you use it each day use it for an hour day? [oh], give me a couple of days

142
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,610
paint relief off my lovely

143
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,050
It's safe, and it's general in general [in] the [skinners] general in the bones

144
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,160
When you sit in a wheelchair all the time, you know you lose bone density

145
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,469
It causes skin issues bowel, or Bladder and the Act of walking helps resolve it

146
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,289
I've taken it home and walked into my local bar because all I do you know walk back in there for the first time

147
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,689
Ever drink with my mates standing up around a [bar] [leader] and to the people to borrow what a trace

148
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,389
Yeah, the day. I was 17 you

149
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:32,159
Later we raced up mount Eden to catch the sunset

150
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:42,899
It's here on top of a volcano that you reminded how young this landscape and people are

151
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,329
industry only began here in earnest in the 1850s and yet [new] [zealand] has come an awfully long way and

152
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,730
the next stop for New zealand [that]

153
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
[would] be space

154
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,409
I think new Zealanders don't think big enough

155
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:14,059
they don't go after the really big problems and the big billion-dollar ideas I

156
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Started building rockets when I was at school

157
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,609
And the very first rocket that I built [I] ended up putting on a bicycle

158
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,890
Most Rocket companies are started by wealthy governments and billionaires

159
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Rocket Lab was started in 2007 by this maniac

160
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Peter Beck

161
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,520
Peter is [one] of the most capable people on the planet

162
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,160
He never went to college

163
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,170
Opting instead to hone his own engineering craft in the garage and machine shops. [oh], I don't know why rockets make me so happy

164
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,700
Now he wants to make [it] much easier and cheaper to put small satellites into space

165
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,820
If you had to set a lot on your lap right [now] in one week, I can have not an orbit moreover

166
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,599
I can have that on orbit an order magnitude less cost than any other way of getting it there

167
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,659
The first rocket launch will take place later this year wow this is the first one. That's Gonna go up yep

168
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:35,809
Commercial customers have already signed up, and there's a two-year waiting list [how] much are you gonna charge per flight weight 4.9 million dollars okay?

169
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,198
For point nine million dollars might seem like a lot

170
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,849
But it's actually a remarkable figure and liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket and dragon

171
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:53,100
The cheapest way to get to space today is on one of elan musk [rockets] from Spacex and that costs sixty million dollars per trip

172
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,449
Propulsion Performing [Amelie]

173
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:02,639
Rocket labs prices would open space to a whole new set of customers including scientists and businesses and in effect

174
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,240
democratize space

175
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,249
This is what the aerospace world has dreamed of for decades. This is the second stage second stage [gym]. You can lift it up. Yeah

176
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:20,189
You rolled your eyes a little bit of this eight wire thing why is that if someone says you know rocket lab is a number

177
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,349
Right [water] company, they'll get you sorted off

178
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,319
The side just gone because number a wire it's about sort of bodging stuff together to make network

179
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:36,299
and it's really not what new zealanders have evolved to it's about really high Tech innovation and doing really really clever things with

180
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,269
Large day approaching the pressure is on

181
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:46,139
Today, they're running an engine test at a site near the auckland airport

182
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:51,209
[so] the worst case scenario a blog hop blows up in the best case is how does it deal or shut down?

183
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:56,159
Building a company is hot yeah building [a] rocket company damn near [insane]

184
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,649
I hitched a ride with peter to the test site and arrived just in time for Countdown three

185
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,119
The engine test was successful, but there's still a ways to go

186
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:17,479
What does it feel like in your gut that countdown clock in the office and everything that comes with sleep much?

187
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:23,839
It's probably the best answer to that question with a bit of luck Peter will maintain his sanity through 2017

188
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,620
That's when rocket lab plans to start flying for paying customers

189
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:36,110
This is a tiny company of a hundred people that will have bested entire nations and firmly put New zealand Stamp on the world

190
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,639
That's not eight wire culture. That's just flat-out amazing

191
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:55,400
And with that it's now time to leave auckland and Journey to Middle-Earth

192
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,159
We could have flown from Auckland, Wellington, and it would have taken an hour

193
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,158
But we wanted to be basted in Hobbit Vibes

194
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,740
We had to see the land

195
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
dear laptop

196
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,348
New Zealand is everything they said it would be

197
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:32,449
[plus] Burger [o's] smells like meat take Slice or grind

198
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,499
If aliens ever visit Earth and want to see what it has to offer

199
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:39,348
[their] first stop would have to be New zealand

200
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,559
It's like a sampler platter of landscapes

201
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,639
Rolling Hills

202
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,639
deserts Plains

203
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,159
Tropical forests whizzing by one after another

204
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:55,189
That's it for now. Thanks for listening laptop love Ashley

205
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,799
Three hours outside of auckland, we made a pit stop in a hot spring

206
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,729
All the times leading into this place for you that you'll get meningitis if you stick your head under water

207
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,530
I'm hoping that I live after this relaxing afternoon

208
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,749
Now before I learn about the meningitis the more afraid I have that I have the vagina

209
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,199
You know you come to new zealand, and it's all a wire cultures. You can set up [rockets]

210
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,510
Xt you know dunk your head underwater that you're dead, so [let's] [employ]

211
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:53,600
[slut] is cool. Just reminds me of love it living her out of my brain

212
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,940
Coming up next on hello world action. I steal Peter Jackson's camera, okay, wait

213
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,030
You've got a run for [safety] and get sucked into virtual reality

214
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:27,350
Welcome to a rainy and famously Windy, Wellington New Zealand's capital City and home to a thriving film industry

215
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,790
Director Peter Jackson is the local boy made good

216
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,499
He famously made lord of the rings here, and then shot past being a one-hit wonder

217
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,590
peters created an entire movie industry based around his film production company wetty

218
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,579
This is well. II would it's just like hollywood, but without any of the glitz and [glamour]

219
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,810
Studio [lots] and sound Stages are dull and unmarked they're tucked into a quiet suburb called Miramar

220
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,920
Wetty has started to expand into virtual reality and I was invited to take a look at their first

221
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,149
Vr. Movie [a] scene from the Hobbit where Smaug wakes up from a nap

222
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,610
You said it wasn't gonna be fried a thief in the shadows

223
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,239
It's crazy bad. I mean you feel like real emotions. What you see it

224
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,790
That's the nice thing moving [fuhrer] you get the people get such much more emotional experience than seeing something like a videogame or whatever [I]?

225
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,990
Think that's kind of where the space

226
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,290
We're in the content generation in the custom technology on the software side to kind of enable these these high-end experiences

227
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,080
Next the studio where they filmed Lord of the rings

228
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
[I] just want to grab that and have a look around

229
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:03,629
Where I got a crash course in motion Capture filmmaking using Peter Jackson's very own custom-made camera

230
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,240
Which isn't really a camera, but more of a device to place a director in a virtual world

231
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,349
There's a screen on the top that shows a rough version of the final graphics while dozens of sensors around the room

232
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,239
Record all [of] the cameras movements all you've got to do is yell action yep

233
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,150
They'll do this stuff, and you say cut like any other film actually

234
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Get inside

235
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:38,189
Hey good way. You've got a run same thing this tech brings a human element back to green screen filmmaking

236
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
It's more tactile

237
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:46,979
It makes the director actually feel like he's shooting the film again [alright] cut

238
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,970
really good sport

239
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:01,839
When it became an industry of its own and after the success of lord of the rings [spawned] startups that are their own mini wettest

240
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,159
I'm actually

241
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,839
On my last stop [I] went to one of these startups [8I] studios

242
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,839
It's a Vr. Company that is recording people in three dimensions to bring them into virtual reality the

243
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,120
[difference] from looking at a video to seeing a hologram that looks just like the real thing

244
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:28,120
[is] so powerful a tie is developing software that will bring Vr to the masses?

245
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,829
The day you can capture a loved one in virtual space is almost here

246
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,620
We'll show you some experiences where we've captured some humans with off-the-shelf cameras

247
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,069
It feels like you're in the room with a person to check it out sure

248
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:45,459
[alright], so you can see the room yep?

249
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,130
alright, so oh

250
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,529
Hello, we create a virtual environment

251
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:57,609
But then we capture a very lifelike motion of the cloth and the human performance and we can compose those together

252
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,019
So you'd been a wet ever used to making these CGI fantastic creatures

253
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:05,289
But it just wouldn't work for a normal person that happened

254
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:09,969
You don't want to drop a visual effects, Hollywood production budget just to record your child

255
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:16,268
Experiencing the first step right and as we saw that these headsets were coming along there was no clear efficient cheap

256
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:19,359
scalable solution to capture reality and to author

257
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:26,349
Experiences at a scale and a realism and have a pace that would create a similar sort of content database for people to enjoy

258
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,120
Let's see how your fear [of] heights is so this is Gonna be like a movie. Oh

259
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,669
my God

260
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,490
That's crazy because I'm sort of like afraid of heights

261
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,490
oh

262
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,590
I

263
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,969
Mean I felt like I was gonna like walk off a cliff. That was really Friday

264
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,309
Although I was a bit skeptical it was time to scan myself

265
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,630
So I could meet the virtual Ashley

266
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,889
Which way do I look like this way you have to look anywhere, okay?

267
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:07,709
You're captured from from all sides [so] have fun, [and] I just have to stay in the circle pretty much

268
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:13,949
I was surrounded by 30 cameras all perfectly spaced and measured it was like in ocd

269
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:21,929
Paparazzi, I'm Ashley vance except I'm not really ashley vance. I'm a digital [asset]. That's being made at a ThAi studios

270
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:29,189
And then in post they put together all those different angles to make a final 3D version of me

271
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,400
If you [want] [to] get really nerdy this is called volumetric

272
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
cinematography just for the nerds

273
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,900
hands and pockets

274
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,979
Hands and pockets it since my little virtual friend

275
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,010
So I get to see my virtual self. Yes

276
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,809
You've seen yourself many many times in 2d video, so I think I would be underwhelmed

277
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:51,599
I think I'm just [gonna] see what I always look like in the mirror

278
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,780
I don't know why seeing like a 3D version of yourself would be a big deal

279
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,199
I would much rather be chased by [smog] so I can just walk around that yeah

280
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,260
That's kind of strange

281
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,040
The details it's saying maybe you can see like whiskers, right yeah

282
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I mean the cameras are just that good and we're looking to increase that resolution as well, Kira sausage

283
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,070
Step into yourself. [oh], [that] is crazy

284
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,649
Well, I also did [not] know where I was in the roof

285
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,480
So I thought it would be really janky, and I mean it is [lifelike]

286
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,389
You know and so [that] I guess was [the] biggest surprise for me

287
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,999
So you think people are going to want Vr to be human?

288
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,700
I've got two boys and they grew up so quick

289
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,850
And it's like oh

290
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,659
Man, if you could just remember how they talked and their gestures and the funny things they said that would be really cool

291
00:26:54,139 --> 00:27:00,009
here's the thing about new zealand its economy today depends on sheep cows and tourists and

292
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:03,309
Everyone knows that needs to change

293
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,919
Technology is the Country's future

294
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,370
Thanks to companies like rocket lab rex bionics and [8i] the change is already underway

295
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:16,839
foreign investors have started to pour money into New Zealand and

296
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,110
Engineers are staying at home because there are good jobs to be [had] if you're an outsider looking to come here

297
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,449
Well, why not the scenery [is] breathtaking?

298
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:29,229
The weather is good and the 8 wired days have passed

299
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,419
New zealand is taking on some of the hardest problems in the industry. It's working on the technology of the absurd

300
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:47,499
In the next episode of hello world [I] go to sweden and hang out with moose Hunters at the Arctic Circle

301
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:57,759
Take over the country's electrical grid seems incredible to raise the two people would handle half a country's power and eat cinnamon buttons with spotify

302
00:27:57,760 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Daniel [Act] like it seems more wholesome than like a cinnabon. Yeah
