116
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,240
this thing is good for learning how to

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,759
write and recognize your letters and

118
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,550
this one's really cool because it's a

119
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,039
dry erase one and it's caught by your

120
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,110

122
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,129

126
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,520
