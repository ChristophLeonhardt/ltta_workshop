1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,877
WE ARE LIVE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,580
PUREE WITH CONNOR.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,881
WHO WAS THE EXACT SPECIFIC

4
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,919
TARGET OF THESE ATTACKS?

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,820
>> THIS CEASE-FIRE DID NOT STOP

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,524
ALL THE VIOLENCE IN

7
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:15,925
AFGHANISTAN.

8
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:16,926
THEY WERE REAL WAS IMPORTANT

9
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:17,860
BECAUSE IT WAS AN AGREEMENT

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,728
BETWEEN THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT

11
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,563
AND THE TALIBAN.

12
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,397
WE SAW THE TALIBAN GOES INTO

13
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:22,265
CITIES, LAID ON WEAPONS AND

14
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:25,268
CELEBRATE THE MUSLIM HOLIDAY.

15
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:30,039
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS

16
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:30,673
CEASE-FIRE IS IT DID NOT

17
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:31,641
INCLUDE ISIS WHO LAUNCHED A

18
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,276
SERIES OF ATTACKS ON THE

19
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:33,776
TALIBAN FIGHTERS.

20
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:37,213
BOTH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND

21
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:38,080
THE CALIBAN OUR ENEMIES AND

22
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,348
ISIS USED THESE CEASE-FIRES TO

23
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:44,987
ATTACK THE CALIBAN IN TWO

24
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:45,721
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.

25
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,489
YESTERDAY THEY KILLED 36

26
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:54,196
PEOPLE, ALL TALIBAN FIGHTERS.

27
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:56,732
THIS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

28
00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:01,671
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE

29
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:10,846
TALIBAN BUT IT EXCLUDED OTHERS.

30
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:11,747
WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT THEY USED

31
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:13,783
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK THE

32
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:14,317
TALIBAN AFGHANISTAN.

33
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,585
>> WITH ISIS OUT FOR BLOOD

34
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:18,321
AGAINST THE TALIBAN WHAT IS THE

35
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:20,423
POTENTIAL OF THE CEASE-FIRE

36
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:22,425
BEING EXTENDED OR ACTUALLY

37
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:23,659
POTENTIALLY BEING HELD AT SOME

38
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:23,959
POINT?

39
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,332
>> THERE IS A LOT IN

40
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:30,032
AFGHANISTAN THAT STATUS WILL

41
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,033
PAVE THE WAY FOR A LARGER

42
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:36,872
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TALIBAN

43
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:37,606
AND AFGHAN GOVERNMENT.

44
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:38,908
THEY SAID THEY WOULD LIKE TO

45
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:39,775
EXTEND THIS FOR SEVERAL MORE

46
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:40,976
DAYS AT THE END OF THE HOLIDAYS

47
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:47,216
WHICH ENDED TONIGHT ON SUNDAY.

48
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:48,017
BUT THE TALIBAN RELEASED A

49
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,318
STATEMENT TODAY SAYING THAT

50
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,152
THEY ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THE

51
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,387
BATTLEFIELD ON MONDAY.

52
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:52,088
STILL, IT IS BEING HAILED A

53
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:53,089
REALLY IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT

54
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:57,393
FOR TALKS BETWEEN THE TALIBAN

55
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:58,561
AND AFGHAN GOVERNMENT.

56
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,462
THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE THAT THE

57
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:01,397
TALIBAN WILL COME TO SEE ISIS

58
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:02,298
AS THE REAL ENEMY AND THEY WILL

59
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:03,966
VIEW THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AS A

60
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,035
POSSIBLE PARTNER IN THE FIGHT

61
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,871
AGAINST ISIS AND GIVES OTHER

62
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:09,338
MILITANT GROUPS.

63
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,306
IT IS PROBABLY A STRETCH RIGHT

64
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,308
NOW BUT THE FACT THAT THE

65
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:14,210
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE

66
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,044
TALIBAN WERE ABLE TO AGREE TO

67
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,780
SOME TYPE OF CEASE-FIRE TOILET

68
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,914
WAS NOT PERFECT, IT DID HOLD

69
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,217
FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS.

70
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:21,917
THEN THE ISIS MILITANTS USE

71
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:27,056
THIS TO ATTACK THE TALIBAN

72
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:27,523
FIGHTERS THERE.

73
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,257
THERE IS A LOT OF HOPE THAT

74
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:29,592
THIS MAY LEAD TO SOME TYPE OF

75
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:30,893
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE

76
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:31,527
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE

77
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:32,228
TALIBAN THAT THERE ARE MUCH

78
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:34,797
MORE IN COMMON OF WHERE THEY

79
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:38,033
SEE AFGHANISTAN GOING AND THAT

80
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,603
THEIR WORK TOGETHER TO BATTLE

81
00:02:40,603 --> 00:00:00,000
ISIS THAT IS REALLY STILL A
