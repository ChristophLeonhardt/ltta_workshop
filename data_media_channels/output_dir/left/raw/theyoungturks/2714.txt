1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,770
ONE YEAR INTO THE TRUMP
PRESIDENCY IT WOULD BE

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,470
INACCURATE TO SAY THAT TRUMP
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING, HASN'T

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,370
MADE ANY MOVES WHEN IT COMES TO
ADDRESSING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,230
HE HAS BEEN, BUT THEY HAPPEN TO
BE IN THE EXACT WRONG DIRECTION.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,100
HAVE A GOOD EXAMPLE WHEN IT
COMES TO FUNDING, WE HAVE

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,390
INFORMATION ABOUT HIS UPCOMING
BUDGET PLANS WHEN IT COMES TO

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,190
THE NATIONAL OFFICE OF DRUG
CONTROL POLICY, AND THEY ARE

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,150
PLANNING TO CUT VIRTUALLY EVERY
DOLLAR FROM TWO OF THE MAJOR

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,540
PROGRAMS IN THAT OFFICE THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH COMBATING THE

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,540
OPIOID EPIDEMIC --

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:54,120
>>THAT IS 
A LOT.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
IT'S NOT
EVERYTHING --

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,360
>>FAKE NEWS, YOU SAID I MOST
EVERYTHING.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,510
THAT'S ONLY 95%.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,180
>>WE ALWAYS SAID THAT UNDER
OBAMA WE GOT 5% CHANGE, HE'S

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,380
FINISHING THE LAST 95% OF IT.

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,090
THEY ARE SAYING DON'T WORRY SO

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,090
MUCH ABOUT THIS --

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,770
>>OKAY, THEY WON'T BE GETTING
THE FUNDING BUT ONCE THEY GET

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,469
MOVED TO THIS NEW PLACE THE
FUNDING WILL PROBABLY COME

21
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:24,520
ABOUT, BUT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS COMES AFTER LAST YEAR

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,920
WHEN --

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,900
>>THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHBACK
AGAINST THAT LAST YEAR, THEN WE

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,729
COME TO THIS YEAR WHERE THEY ARE
LIKE, OKAY, WE ARE CUTTING 95%

25
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:37,500
OF IT, IT WILL BE FINE
OVER THERE I'M SURE.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,249
I'M NOT CONVINCED AT THIS POINT.

27
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:45,470
>>WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING
THE STORY I THOUGHT, I THINK I

28
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,929
MIGHT DEFEND TRUMP HERE.

29
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,119
AND
MAYBE I'LL TALK TO JOHN ABOUT

30
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,409
TAKING IT OUT OF THE RUNDOWN, IF
THEY ARE JUST MOVING STUFF WHO

31
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,409
CARES?

32
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,679
THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO
MOVE IT FROM ONE PART OF THE

33
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,880
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO ANOTHER.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,270
BUT
SILLY ME TO HAVE TRUSTED THE

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,420
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM HALF A
STORY.

36
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,600
WHEN I WAS REMINDED, OH

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,790
RIGHT, THEY TRIED TO CUT THIS
BUDGET COMPLETELY JUST A LITTLE

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,989
WHILE AGO.

39
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,170
THAT'S IMPORTANT
CONTEXT.

40
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,560
THEN WIPING OUT 95% OF

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,900
THE BUDGET AND SAYING DON'T
WORRY, LATER THAT WILL REAPPEAR

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,120
SOMEWHERE ELSE, BECOMES LESS
BELIEVABLE.

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,390
HE DECLARED THE

44
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,840
OPIOID CRISIS A NATIONAL
EMERGENCY MYRA MEMBER THE POOR

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,900
DAD WHO REALLY BELIEVED IN TRUMP
ANYONE AROUND TO A LOT OF TRUMP

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,160
RALLIES AND HE SAYING, HE HAD A
GUITAR, HE WAS TRYING TO DRAW

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,890
ATTENTION BECAUSE HIS SON HAD
DIED FROM THIS CRISIS, THEN THEY

48
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,930
INTERVIEWED HIM AFTERWARDS WHEN
TRUMP ORIGINALLY BASICALLY SAID

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,870
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND ANYTHING
ON IT, AND HE WAS LIKE, NO, WHAT

50
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,870
HAPPENED?

51
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,540
HE WAS HEARTBROKEN
OVER IT.

52
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,540
WHAT HAPPENED IS, ON

53
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,599
EVERY SINGLE ISSUE HE LIED TO
YOU.

54
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
NOW, NATIONAL EMERGENCY,

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
HE'S NOT GOING TO SPEND ANY
MONEY ON IT.

56
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,159
WHERE DOES IT MAKE

57
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,239
ME MONEY?

58
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,829
THIS DOESN'T HELP MY
DONORS AT ALL.

59
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:08,829
IN FACT, PERHAPS

60
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,680
SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN DONORS
ARE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,681
DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THE OPIOID CRISIS, AND ALL

62
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:18,380
OF A SUDDEN ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS
GO AWAY.

63
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,380
INTERESTING.

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,020
>>THIS CRISIS KILLS 91 AMERICANS
EVERY DAY, SUPERSEDING CAR

65
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,230
CRASHES NOW.

66
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,310
MORE AMERICANS DIE
FROM OPIOID ADDICTION THEN CAR

67
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,340
CRASHES.

68
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,239
TRUMP DECLARED HE WOULD
REALLY TACKLE THE OPIOID

69
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,239
EPIDEMIC.

70
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,239
WHAT DID HE DO?

71
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,239
HE
PICKED PEOPLE WITHIN THE

72
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,969
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO RUN
DRUG MANAGEMENT LIKE HE'S DOING

73
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,599
EVERYWHERE.

74
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,209
I JUST INTERVIEWED
THE LAWYER WHO IS ATTACKING THE

75
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,459
DRUG PUSHERS, HE IS SAYING IT'S
NOT THE DOCTORS, WE CAN BLAME

76
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,670
ADDICTS OR DOCTORS, IT'S THE
DRUG PUSHERS WHO PREY ON

77
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,830
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND
EXPLOIT THEM, AND WE NEED TO GO

78
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,830
AFTER THEM.

79
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,329
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
TRUMP, HE'S JUST LINING THE

80
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,469
POCKETS OF HIS FRIENDS JUST LIKE
HE DOES WITH EVERY PROBLEM IN

81
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:04,840
EVERY SCENARIO.

82
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,280
>>AND SAYING WE ARE JUST MOVING
IT, NOT KILLING IT, IT REMINDS

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,030
ME, WE JUST REPORTED ON THE
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

84
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,590
BUREAU, THEY TRIED TO STOP IT
FROM BEING ESTABLISHED YEARS

85
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,690
AGO, THEN THEY TRIED TO KILL IT
YEAR AFTER YEAR, THEY HAVEN'T

86
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,410
BEEN ABLE TO, SO WHAT DO THEY
DO?

87
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,890
THEY PUT SOMEONE IN CONTROL

88
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,180
OF IT THAT REQUESTED ZERO
DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET.

89
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,180
IT'S

90
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,230
LIKE KILLING IT BY ANY OTHER
NAME.

91
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,580
AND IT IS JUST THIS, YOU

92
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,250
CUT THOSE TWO PROGRAMS, THAT'S
NOT THE ONLY THING THEY COULD

93
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,640
HAVE DONE THEORETICALLY TO DEAL
WITH THE CRISIS, BUT IT'S PART

94
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,900
OF A LONG PATTERN.

95
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,580
THAT SAME
OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL

96
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,500
POLICY, HE STILL HAS NOT NAMED A
PERMANENT DIRECTOR OF IT.

97
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
SEEMS

98
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,710
LIKE IF YOU CARE ABOUT THIS
EPIDEMIC THAT YOU HAVE LABELED A

99
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,940
NATIONAL EMERGENCY, YOU WOULD AT
LEAST HAVE SOMEONE OTHER THAN --

100
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,950
WASN'T CRIST CHRISTIE SUPPOSED
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE OPIOID

101
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,950
EPIDEMIC?

102
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,830
MAYBE JARED IS DOING
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

103
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,830
BUT IT'S NOT

104
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,490
JUST THAT, LAST YEAR HE GOT SOME
GOOD PRESS FOR ALLOCATING SOME

105
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,940
FUNDING TO DEAL WITH IT, NEVER
MEMBER REPORTING ON IT, IT WAS

106
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,460
1% OF WHAT EXPERTS SAY WOULD BE
NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY DEAL WITH

107
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,420
THE EPIDEMIC ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

108
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,970
AND YOU SAID HE DECLARED IT A
HEALTH EMERGENCY, I'VE ALSO

109
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,200
FOUND REFERENCES, HE CALLED IT
A NATIONAL SHAME, I HUMAN

110
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,130
TRAGEDY, AND VOWED TO WIN.

111
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,450
>>YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A HUMAN
TRAGEDY?

112
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,450
THE ATTACKS ON

113
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,680
MARIJUANA, WHICH ARE LEGAL
ALTERNATIVES, AND A LOT OF THESE

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,990
STATES HE IS OVERWRITING STATES
RIGHTS AND DOING THESE GIANT

115
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,990
DRUG WARS ON DRUGS THAT COULD
HELP PEOPLE WITH PAIN MANAGEMENT

116
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,680
AND ALTERNATIVES TO HEROIN AND
OPIOIDS.

117
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
IT'S DISGUSTING, JEFF

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,370
SESSIONS'S INSANE REEFER
MADNESS.

119
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,390
>>WHAT DECADE IS HE FROM?

120
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:53,170
>>FROM THE KEEBLER ELF COOKIE
BOX.

121
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,820
>>WHEN I WAS A KID MARIJUANA,
GATEWAY DRUG.

122
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,820
WE FOUND THE

123
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,760
GATEWAY DRUG, THE JURY IS IN,
IT'S PRESCRIPTION PAIN RELIEF

124
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,940
SO-CALLED DRUGS.

125
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,411
FIRST OF ALL
THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAD TO

126
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,580
ANYTHING, YOU GET ADDICTED TO
THE PAINKILLERS AND A LOT OF

127
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,970
PEOPLE DIE FROM THAT, AND SOME
OF IT LEADS TO HEROIN AND A LOT

128
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,840
OF PEOPLE DIE FROM THAT, AND SO
WE KNOW WHAT THE GATEWAY DRUG IS

129
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,060
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY

130
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,150
MAKE BILLIONS OFF THE GATEWAY
DRUG.

131
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,830
AND MARIJUANA IN STATES

132
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,910
WHERE IT'S LEGAL THEY ARE
STARTING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF

133
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,660
IT, ALL OF A SUDDEN REPUBLICANS
ARE LIKE, MARIJUANA ISN'T SO

134
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
BAD.

135
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,610
BUT THEY STILL FIGHT IT
OVERALL BECAUSE THE DRUG

136
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,060
COMPANIES, DAMMIT, IT'S JUST A
PLANT, IT'S HARDER TO MAKE MONEY

137
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,250
OFF A PLANT.

138
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,860
WE HAVE TO TRY TO
CREATE SOME FAKE VERSION THAT IS

139
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,700
EVEN MORE ADDICTIVE SO THEY CAN
PATENT IT AND MAKE MORE MONEY

140
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,120
AND BUY OFF THESE POLITICIANS.

141
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,500
FINALLY, THIS EPIDEMIC IS SO OUT

142
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,530
OF CONTROL THAT EVEN
REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY IN

143
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,620
AFFLICTED STATES LIKE WEST
VIRGINIA AND OHIO, ARE LIKE, NO,

144
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,680
DON'T AGREE WITH TRUMP, WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

145
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
AND

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
IT'S NOT JUST US SAYING HE'S
TRYING TO KILL THE PROGRAM AND

147
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,320
NOT MOVE IT, SHELLEY MOORE
CAPITO FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND

148
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,080
ROB PORTMAN FROM OHIO, BOTH
DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS,

149
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,940
ARE SAYING DON'T MOVE IT, DON'T
KILL IT, DON'T DEFUND IT, WE

150
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,530
NEED THIS MONEY.

151
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,500
LITERALLY WE
ARE DYING HERE.

152
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
AND HE SAYS TO

153
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,930
THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, I
DON'T CARE, YOU AREN'T A DONOR.

154
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,980
GO DIE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

155
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,650
>>THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY
IS AS WILL BE THE CASE WITH

156
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,140
EVERY OTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW
EXPENSIVE IT WOULD BE TO DO

157
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,090
THINGS I WANT TO DO, I WILL
COMPARE IT TO THE $1.5 TRILLION

158
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,460
THEY JUST DECIDED TO HAND TO
CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY.

159
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
WE

160
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,500
COULD CURE THIS EPIDEMIC AND IT
WOULD BE A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT

161
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,060
THEY JUST CASUALLY GAVE AWAY
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY

162
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,020
WEALTHY THAN THE EMPERORS FROM
THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY.

163
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,560
>>JOHN, THAT IS SUCH A GOOD
POINT.

164
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,150
NEVER THEY TELL YOU,

165
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,780
OPIOID CRISIS, YOUR SON DIED
FROM IT AND YOU BELIEVED IN

166
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,450
TRUMP AND ALL THIS, BUT WE DON'T
HAVE THE MONEY -- THEY JUST GAVE

167
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,630
AWAY $1.5 TRILLION TO THE
