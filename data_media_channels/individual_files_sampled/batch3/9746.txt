US. RAGING ON WE'RE LESS THAN AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY OPENING IN JERUSALEM. BRIAN: HARRIS FAULKNER IS LIVE THERE WITH TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE MNUCHIN. HEY, HARRIS. I'M STANDING WITH THE SECRETARY. YOU WILL BE UNVEILING WITH THE ACTUAL, DOING DEDICATION. TELL ME WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING. I WILL INDEED. I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE ON THIS INCREDIBLE MOMENTOUS DAY. I HAVE THE GREAT HONOR OF PULLING THE ROPE THAT WILL BRING BIG FLAG. WE HAVE A U.S. CONFLICT HERE. THAT CONSULATE, THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. THIS INCREASES OUR FOOTPRINT. IT IS ALL OVER THE CITY AND THE COUNTRY. THE BANNERS SAY MAKE ISRAEL GREAT. PROMISES KEPT? ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. THE PRESIDENT IS FULFILLING A CAMPAIGN PROMISE SOMETHING HE SAID HE WOULD DO. OTHER PRESIDENTS SAID THEY WOULD DO THIS AND THEY DIDN'T. IT WAS OVER 20 YEARS SINCE CONGRESS PASSED THE JERUSALEM EMBASSY ACT AND THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING GOOD ON IT NOW. REPORTER: SECRETARY, CAN I ASK BUT THE POLITICAL HURDLE FOR SOME YEARS, DECADES IN SOME CASES AS LAWMAKERS TRY TO FIGURE OUT MOVING THE EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM. WHAT CHANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT? I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS TAKING ACTION. WHETHER IT IS THIS. WHETHER THE NUCLEAR DEAL OR WITH NORTH KOREA, THIS PRESIDENT IS TAKING ACTION. HE IS DOING IT BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. ISRAEL IS ONE OF OUR CLOSEST PARTNERS. ISRAEL IS ABSOLUTELY FIGHTING TERRORISM WITH US AND COMBATING TERRORIST FINANCING. THE PRESIDENT IS FULFILLING WHAT HAS BEEN AN ACT OF CONGRESS. REPORTER: ONE OF THE STORIES BURST ON THE SCENE THE ISRAELI MILITARY DROPPING LEAFLETS, DON'T GO TO THE GAZA STRIP WITH YOUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS HUMAN SHIELDS. THEY'RE PROTESTING MIGHTILY. WHEN WE STAND WITH ISRAEL WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN. PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT IS HIS ON VECK TIFF. WITH EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WE RECOGNIZE HAVING THE EMBASSY IN THEIR CAPITAL. THIS IS THE CAPITAL. THIS IS, AS I SAID, ON THE 70th ANNIVERSARY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FULFILLING SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO. REPORTER: ONE LAST QUESTION ABOUT THAT POINT, IT IS 70th OBSERVATION OF ISRAEL AS NATION-STATE TODAY. THERE IS A LOT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY. THERE IS HIGH SECURITY, YOU FELT IT AS YOU WERE COMING IN, WE ALL DID, WHAT WILL THE PRESIDENT SAY? HE WILL HAVE A TAPED VIDEO TODAY. WHAT WILL THE PRESIDENT SAY MOVING DOWN THE ROAD IN REGARD TO ISRAEL? YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO PREVIEW WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY, WE'LL HAVE A BUNCH OF SPEECHES. JARED KUSHNER IS WORKING ON THE SPEECH PROCESS IS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. THIS IS INCREDIBLE DAY TO BE HERE IN ISRAEL. VERY PROUD TO REPRESENT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE ADMINISTRATION. AND IT IS MOMENTOUS TIME. THE PRESIDENT IS JUST ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED MAKING SURE THAT AMERICANS ARE SAFE, THAT PEOPLE HERE IN THE REGION ARE SAFE. IT IS NOT COINCIDENTAL THIS IS THE WEEK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WE'RE GETTING OUT OF A BAD IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL. REPORTER: THAT TIMING IS SO INTERESTING. YOU KNOW AS YOU COME IN HERE YOU FEEL PEOPLE HAVE THEIR CHEST OUT AND THERE IS SO MUCH PRIDE. I TALKED WITH A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND ABOUT AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT RESPECT LAST WEEK. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT, AMERICA RESPECTED MORE AROUND THE WORLD? I THINK IT'S THE CASE. I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING DIFFICULTY DECISIONS WHAT HE BELIEVES ARE THE RIGHT LONG-TERM DECISIONS AND NOT JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. AND IF YOU, AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK AT ISRAEL, WE ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS IS THEIR CAPITAL, WHICH IT HAS BEEN. WE'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE TREAT EVERY OTHER COUNTRY. REPORTER: WHEN CRITICS EVEN SOME HERE IN ISRAEL, SAYING THIS IS MOSTLY SYMBOLIC, WILL IT BE REAL? WILL IT BE REAL? IT IS VERY REAL TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL. IT IS VERY, VERY MEANINGFUL. WE'VE BEEN HERE YESTERDAY MIDDAY. BEEN TO LOTS OF ACTIVITIES. PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE VERY EXCITED THAT THE PRESIDENT STOOD UP FOR THEM. REPORTER: WE GOT TO BE HERE FOR THE TESTING, REHEARSAL EARLIER AND THEY SANG HALLELUJAH IN HEBREW AND ENGLISH. THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF WORLD AND ISRAEL BECAUSE THE WORLD IS WATCHING? THANKS FOR BEING A GREAT PARTNER WITH THE UNITED STATES HELPING US FIGHT TERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND STANDING WITH US. IT IS AN IMPORTANT ALLIES. WE HAVE LOTS OF IMPORTANT ALLIES AND WE'RE THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY. REPORTER: SECRETARY, WHEN YOU PULL ALL THAT ROPE AND YOU DO ALL THAT JAZZ YOU DO TODAY WE'LL GET IT ALL.
