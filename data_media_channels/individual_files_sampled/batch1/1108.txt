out in the deep blue seeing the ocean's wild inhabitants can be a magical experience these are wide-ranging intelligent socially complex predators you can't forget when you see an orca reach right in front of you we go at that sound is just absolutely pocketed it's life they're breathing but these majestic creatures along with other marine life are being hunted to supply an unprecedented demand for entertainment in China what we're seeing in China is a very rapid explosive growth with big elaborate marine theme parks and a lot of these places do not have the expertise to be doing what they're doing and inside these popular aquariums we find evidence of widespread neglect and abuse I'm Steve Chow on this episode of one on one East we go behind the scenes of China's marine theme parks and expose the dark side they don't want to deceive it's a weekday at an aquatic center in Dalian China and the stands are pattern center stage are dumping these clips and high-flying buildings wowed the crowd while these shows have been common in Western countries for decades in China aquariums are new and exotic places where the growing middle class can get close to wild animals and be entertained but for the animals in China's marine theme parks insiders tell us pleasing the crowd takes a heavy toll having the Territorian at Halawa enhances its a Eurasian to analyze my engine coolant but I've sort of aha so they're in the auditorium the terrible search for laibach would only 24 me over two years 101 East investigated China's multi-billion dollar aquarium industry examining more than 15 marine parks and interviewing more than a dozen insiders we uncovered widespread abuse total your tradition coral garnish on all our being worked at two of these aquariums training seals and dolphins Josie calls or so we were just all so welcome Tova and into chickens or as a whole the shank need to change some pharma WIC on Felucia generally happens higher decision so you're tortured uh european for the fashion round called water lily ogia just how you feel young Samana found him rather than happy cooperative animals a being says he found them often sick and distressed what they weren't performing he was ordered to Lock seals in tiny cages and dolphins that would normally swim hundreds of kilometers a day in the wild were constrained in tiny tails till you turn your eyes on life intelligence harnesses oh no you got the war may control sleeping out all the time you gonna finish a dope on you come over charlie don't attrition youth older children council chain 2004 you touch with anymore the walls IPO George Chancellor ah come on Bishop you can't hide ineligible formula doctrine in the dome runners Philippe Puyo yeah park staff tell us beating them with sticks is common practice and that's not all a being says the performances are physically punishing we shall eat hello little girl yeah well us Alessandra - no sir ibrahim oh yeah in yo you're totally totally bad are strictly panettone trainers are not let's hang on coach you watch what was well for short Association we are society show children Shibuya and a pretty miserable death at one aquarium our investigation found a freezer full of carcasses a secretly recorded conversation with the marine parts vet reveals how they died the vet goes further asking to keep the high rates of premature deaths under wraps more secretly recorded footage reveals sick turtles unfed and dumped in bins we also discover arctic foxes on display in obvious distress this man will call leader was responsible for feeding and caring for animals at a major marine park the degree of suffering he discovered short-term so don't remain in his Honda hematoma so Holocene - so he knows food only you a woman concerning cause I paint samples oh hayoung want general or total village and hunger to each other so we can know you see a portion bin for sure what the raw materials yeah no ha or conversely API and yeah hi yah yah yah yah yo chill oh yeah hot daughter I was in church - do you move the audience - or laid his hand on the whole sound solution mean we filmed dozens of seals blind from cataracts and suffering from skin diseases too sick to be shown to the public they are left in shallow dirty water in areas called dying rooms and tell me o dominant or general yo alien for the sega nova you Ortiz was a urine chip all mine abortion beam coming up I'll exam now current commentator for shows actual the uses also column but I like : you may make her at all pirate ng Wow trainer are being confirms what we found and blames the blindness not only on lack of natural light but on the aquarium shows themselves launched on college ocean a shit don't worry we'll know the wall a cultural total you either Tasha's occasion channel yoga the Sun window to put your nurse and also the young surfer world should hold him hold his own with that conscience I gotta which we underwent your phone and he says the marine parks failed to provide anything close to adequate care for their animals they have to be able to submerge and these these guys seem to be sitting on the bottom of the tank and they're halfway out of the water we show these images today Oh mirros one of the world's most well-known marine mammal scientists they're swimming in their own feces that looks like a almost like a concentration camp they're being cruel to these animals to keep them there permanently that's just cruel and it wouldn't meet the standards in the US or there or Europe or anything like that but in China there are no national laws against mistreating animals for decades Naomi's documented the treatment of captive animals around the world she and other animal welfare activists have visited dozens of facilities in China and say they've never seen such bad conditioners several of the facilities that I visited were very young they were only you know five six seven years old and I was surprised because they look like they were 30 or 40 years old both in terms of their design it was very old-fashioned small circular tanks which just aren't it's not done anymore and they were just degrading they were rusting they were chipping they were crumbling you know concrete was actually crumbling in a six-year old facility and that crumbling infrastructure is having a devastating impact on the health of animals in one case dolphins and belugas playing with an ingesting paint and other debris when they start doing this sort of repetitive behavior with a found object which is a in this case a paint chip which could be toxic it is indicative of failed husbandry I mean how many times are they eating paint chips a day it doesn't have to be a particularly toxic paint for that to become an issue throughout our investigation we found an industry that publicly appears to care for animals but in private treats them very differently the whole way if we didn't own this walls or on sends a lot don't consider Pecola enough for me bath on I'm in discern Joslin Chanda and a lot of people want to share of these profits the number of aquariums being built is growing astronomically a few years ago there were only a handful of these places in China today there are more than 60 multi-million dollar marine theme parks with about a dozen more being built nowhere else on the planet have so many marine animals been taken from the wild and put on display aquariums here each boast of having on average twenty thousand species of marine life even malls are getting into the business workers tell us the treatment there is even worse this is a never-ending cycle of death for the animals in the wild where they're just being taken and siphoned off from their natural populations put into boxes in China they die and more come in so this is just a one-way conveyor belt and it ends in death at the other end this is supposed to be entertaining we asked the aquarium's we investigated and the government ministry's supervising them to respond to our findings of mistreatment they all declined to find out how the parks source their animals we put on hidden cameras and meat a key industry advisor he's helped many aquariums acquire their marine mammals from around the world we've told them we're developers looking to set up a Marine I know I know Mindy Cassini musulega seek our young MA after buying the animals the consultant advises us that to get them into China we will have to bribe officers while there seems to be no problem buying the animals in another meeting he warns us to avoid the feelings of other marine parks in China to the survey are filled by Serbia don't you have the other please understand us yeah 3001 I can't without how was this me Roger cuz of me Oh India that's the God look cut the earth to the cornea and I die I'm going through John Cornyn johnny test No yes that made you guys okay he still makes money sounds catches the bouquet because the marine parks view their animals as disposable he says many don't invest in skilled staff get out a meager training increases kabbadi income and mio-chan oh my gosh oh yah oh yah oh yah oh sure Tweel former trainer are being confirms Marine Park workers don't need much experience to his surprise this even included the vets home Patricia oh sure sure yeah - oh yeah too young too young voltage relations are sure if the above another for Sean moody know your hotel you know Tim O'Hara no not a mimosa politician one marine part even left the veterinary care up to trainers like him children are you sure I mean Adam an entire hole I can you should eat your heart I think you usually refer someone with a toll-free trainer insurance again kind of a terawatt somewhat enroll okay that should be 30 no you may even hear our being says he was astounded to be put in charge of dozens of animals he had no qualifications or training and was just a university student studying account I'm trying you know each other Sam it's washable soldier that people are you guys sure you go favorite children did you high up or don't you actually your feet how do you see the words there so you're not trying for I said I know not you're sure Chelsea Diana you thought your quarter all right yeah Evernote whole Walternate notes I say it's when Lily Messiah I never saw a girl no not yet the lack of training has Naomi rose not only worried about the animals but also the aquarium employees so it looks like this scuba diver is scrubbing the bottom of the tank to the whale obviously this is all a game but the divers in a vulnerable position what if the whale look he's he's he could potentially just pull the guys regulator right out of his mouth none of that's appropriate she says some practices she sees are downright dangerous to actually have a diver who's dependent on a tank and a regulator in the water with I don't know three at least wild blue girls that are clearly not trained to interactive with him appropriately I get that really they just don't realize that this guy is actually in danger like in serious danger potentially oh yeah while posing as marine park developers we were given a behind-the-scenes tour of one of China's aquariums during it the general manager here confirms that one of its cleaners almost died the manager says the Beluga was planed but it almost killed you need Inuit ha nurten table how do you any good in our he says the aquarium doesn't ensure employees because due to the high risk premiums are too expensive thinner than often I can't a tutor but double fine you watch is that don't worry you are so turn that off central authority today just open again sir these are wild animals and according to the manager caging them in confined spaces can lead to hyper aggressive behavior dangerous not just to their carers but to other animals here researchers film a dolphin attacking another for hours on end former trainer are being says he witnessed a dolphin bullied so much it's only Escape was to jump out of the tank an action that would have led to its own death what are you your ego Sean Farrell chao chih-hao jun company here that hasn't our talent hold on you're sure maja Piazza Zhi Li has really matured all our angel there's only part of a little not a solution but despite concerns over animal and employee health marine parks have long argued they serve a valuable purpose educating the public about marine life but Naomi isn't convinced it really is completely ludicrous for them to argue that you have to see the animal in the flesh to care about it if that line of logic is true then 90% of the species in this world are doomed that isn't they hunt in captivity and what eight-year-old have you ever met who isn't totally jazzed by dinosaurs and I don't think I've ever seen a live one what experts like Naomi know is that with the growing demand from China's marine parts the oceans wildlife is under greater threat than ever one of the most majestic and sought-after animals is the Orca also known as the killer whale in this rare vision of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia fishermen were filmed netting orcas for marine theme parks it is one of the only places in the world that still allows such captures it's devastating to Orca populations because they're so tightly bonded to family they are so social they're so intelligent they're so cultural that if you just come in in a slave raid and remove you know three or four babies and the mothers are screaming and that's what happens you know they're trying to protect their offspring while these capture operators come in and cut them out and put them in a Corral and you know it's chaos it's it's trauma earlier this year the Russian government approved the capture of 26 more orcas destined for the Chinese market while once-popular across the world most Orca shows like this one at SeaWorld in Florida have been stopped after widespread condemnation and the deaths of trainers but in China it's a different story they're gearing up for Orca shows one of China's largest aquariums has released footage of orcas being trained in their facility a secretly recorded conversation with one of China's largest animal importers explains why they're so highly sought after we can outwait yes how many according to government import papers China's marine parks have been bringing in orcas since 2012 despite this none have been put on display the aquarium manager we met with tells us the holdup is the fear of bad publicity media etcetera so going to the Gucci the poet our teacher is not the random chamber Oh Nina was touching comment on the palazzo initiative indicator Nichkhun me me over your home use only the musical Wow Marine Mammal scientist Naomi rose hopes orcas will never be on display in China and she says the key lies in changing public perception there has to be the hope the hope has to be that China and Russia even can move along the same societal trajectory the same growth and self-awareness and a public awareness and in empathy to finally get to the point where oh you know this is wrong when you see animals like these in their natural habitat it's clear how highly intelligent and highly social they are once you know that and I only believes it's very hard to accept there's a place for them cooped up behind glass instead she says they should be left free to roam the ocean you
