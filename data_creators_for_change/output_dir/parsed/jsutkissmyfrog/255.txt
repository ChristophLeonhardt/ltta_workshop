let me not to the marriage of true minds
love is not love that alters when it
alteration finds or bends with the
remover to remove for no it is an
ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests
and is managing does the star to every
wandering bark withe unknown although
its height be taken love's not times
fool though rosy lips and cheeks within
its bending sickles compass come love
alters not with his brief hours and
weeks but bears it out to the edge of do
if this be error and upon me proved I
never writ nor no man ever loved
