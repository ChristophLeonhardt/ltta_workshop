MESSAGE TO THE YOUNG LEADER. Neil: ALL RIGHT. COLONEL, THANKS FOR STOPPING BY. COLONEL BOB SERVED OUR COUNTRY NOTABLY HERE. THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS NOBLY GREETED IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE PRESIDENT MAKING GOOD ON TARIFF THREATS WITH COUNTRIES THAT SEND US A LOT OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM. 25% TARIFF ON STEEL-RELATED PRODUCTS. 10% ON ALUMINUM. THIS ISN'T REALLY AN OPENING SALVO TO CHINA. IT'S MEANT MORE TO HURT THE MEXICANS AND CANADIANS. NONE OF THEM LIKE IT. GERMANY PLANNING A RESPONSE. THE MEXICANS HAVE BEEN QUIET BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING QUIETLY WHEN IT COMES TO A RESPONSE. THE FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL, ANYET EMANUEL. THE MARKETS FELL OFF ON THIS NEWS. IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE WAS WAS GOING TO DO IT. NOW HE DID WHAT DO YOU THINK? SLAPPING TARIFFS ON YOUR CLOSEST ALLIES IS NOT A SMART POLICY. THE CHINESE ARE CHEATING. THEY'RE PLAYING A HUNDRED YEAR GAME. THEY'RE FOCUSING ON INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE, THEY'RE FOCUSING ON INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE, ROBOTS, AEROSPACE. WE NEED TO PUSH BACK ON CHINA. THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. Neil: MAYBE THERE'S A METHOD TO THIS THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING OR I'M NOT SEEING, THAT THE PRESIDENT HOPING TO GET THESE COUNTRIES OF MEXICO AND CANADA, EUROPE, BACK TO THE TABLE WITH SOMETHING. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I HOPE THAT'S THE CASE. FROM THE FOLKS THAT I SPEAK TO IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALSO IN THE GOVERNMENT AND EUROPE AND CANADA AND MEXICO, THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE. THEY ARE PUSHING HARD TO FINISH THE NAFTA NEGOTIATION. THAT IS QUITE GOOD. IT WOULD BE REALLY WORRYING IF OUR BRINKSMANSHIP ON TRADE IN
