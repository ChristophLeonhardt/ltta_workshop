well I'm with Ilan Davidi the mayor of Shirota and mayor I thought I say I'm from Toronto I think the worst issue when you're a Torontonian is traffic just the congestion in terms of gain to work but compared to what you endure and your people of sorrow 28,000 here in this town of rockets coming over where it's literally a matter of life and death traffic's nothing mera gotta ask you why would anyone choose to live under these conditions I think you can ask the people the Jewish community in Toronto because I think that the Jewish community in Toronto I've been there many time and I think that there is the most beautiful and wonderful Zion community all over the world that put that love Israel and help us with the road many times but for your question it's a very good question this is our country we're just one country you remember the Holocaust we see what's happened in Europe when what someone want to kill Jewish and kill six million Jewish and no one can protect them I believe that we have just one country the Israeli country Israel and I think that this is our land this is our city this is our my house so I think that this it's not just to live it's a mission and I really feel that I am ambassador my family ambassador not of just of the Jewish nation where the ambassador of Europe of United States of all over the world I think that we need to destroy tale and what they try to do day after day with rockets with tunnels with balloon with weapon they just want to say that with the delay of the Hamas the dialogic of Isis that the allegic of jihad it's we win bringing dead that in bad things to the area we said we want to bring good things so I guess what you're saying is this the proverbial line in the sand in other words if you were to withdraw if this town were to become a ghost town overnight all that would happen I guess would be the terrorists getting a longer-range rockets to target some other Israeli community yes and this is the situation because that I'm charged about the civilian so with wide and we walk with the government and about everything about in charge about for me from Bennett and Netanyahu our Prime Minister that he said always to me when he come to his devotee and he come a lot of time to start seven times just in the last four years he always said that alone when the lot is strong Israel it strong and because that I think that you put the right point that we know that if we will go back they will go after us Ashkelon Ashdod Tel Aviv and in the end of Jerusalem so so we try to make our life better we try to invest in education we built a lot of parks in the city will build new neighborhood Dominican goes around the what you will see that in the end we won't we went one and we will win every day and day after and being a resident of Sirat I imagine it's all about adaptation I mean right now we are in this indoor playground I'm of two opinions first the innovation here of keeping children safe is absolutely incredible you know there's an even an integrated bomb shelter to protect children this the second thing though is that you know here we are it's a beautiful summer day sunny and warm in Canada we tell kids hey get out of the house and Seurat you say get indoors to play I mean what are your opinions of that especially since many of the children are most of the children in this town mayor actually suffer from PTSD first I know what you talk about because I have seven kids two boys and five girls and two of them suffer from a post trauma problem so we know what's they mean this is a place that we very used in a bad day especially when the army make operation in Gaza for one month two months so we use with this place and the original day we will bring a group of children beside this place with a beautiful park ins devote we we walk and put the little shelter every parks but you can go around the world we on we stopped to hide we stopped who I'd I am the mayor of the world for me for years after the the last wall that we've been in guys that were made in Gaza I'm not hiding I opened my children go around the parks people go around people live smile and happy it's a very it's not it's not it's not so simple but we we think that we can do it I guess mayor the worst night in sorts history was that night in May when 293 rockets in one day fell upon this town mayor I'm trying to get an idea you know for our audience when you say a rocket what does that mean like when you look at one individual rocket what kind of damage can that do if it hits say a a house or a bus imagine someone take a gun put it near to your head and said I want to kill you so imagine it happened 200 time in night it's happened one time in night no one allow the to this situation happen it's a very bad situation it's a very bad situation just to one and save your life with 15 second how I know because I feel it when you say 15 seconds that's the amount of time you have to get to a shelter yes because if you will not be any shelter someone the rocket can blow you and you can look I can give you my example I can give you example two days ago four o'clock in the night alarm system start to start to shout saver dome red color I me and my wife need to wake up and find seven kids all over the house in 15 seconds just to find them and with them run to the shelter many time will not find someone many times we are outside from the city and our children in the city it's a very difficult situation just to imagine something something happen or not happen I'm not I'm not I'm hope that in your town in your country not will happen I not wish this situation to another person but I can promise to the people of Gaza and the leadership especially the leadership of the Hamas you will lose every day that you continue to use with detail to destroy this area you destroyed your life not our life in the end we are strong well believe in our country and you and kiss the Lord will continue to develop it's a fantastic message and I just have one last question mayor what do you make of the world community and specifically the press of the world in terms of the coverage of Sirat I mean why don't we see the images of children being traumatized the injuries the death the destruction here it seems to be really one-sided when it comes to this neck of the woods first it's really one side because in the in the side of Gaza the leadership used with the community to successful with their mission they send children to the border they use the money that people all over the world give to them to build Hospital to build school and use it for to buy balm and to buy a weapon to destroy it and they try to destroy us so my wish and my eye mask from the leadership of all the people of all over the world don't put any dollars in Amla in organization that the money go through Gaza we need to find a economic solution that it will be in charge about Egypt Israel and all the nation of the world if you want to build a hospital not don't build it in Gaza don't put any shekel dollars dinar nothing in Gaza because all your money go to the find and build a tunnels under the ground it's you they use the money to buy another orchid and they use them to buy them to to buy weapon to kill me in my family and I think that I don't do anything bad to your community and to all of the walls so please we need your your love to us not at all thank you so much I think you and everyone living in this town is so courageous I'm gonna try to make a promise and that is never to complain about Toronto traffic again given what the people of Zurich go through thank you so much for your time thank you very much hey folks if you want to see more of our coverage from the Holy Land please go to
