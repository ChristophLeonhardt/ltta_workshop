the Department of Justice has had to admit to a federal judge and also to the ACLU that in some cases they may have separated children from US citizens and also detained these US citizens for up to a year these were mistakes made during Trump's enforcement of his so-called zero tolerance policy so the Department of Justice told a federal judge that it may have mistakenly separated a father and toddler who could both be US citizens for as long as a year the individual representing the ACLU in this case said the following the fact that a citizen got caught up in this mess shows just how poor the government's record-keeping was and this is just the latest example so Trump is known for using policies or implementing policies that have not been well thought-out he does it all the time I mean the first example of that during his presidency was his ban on transgender individuals in the military he didn't talk to the Justice Department about he didn't talk to the Department of Defense about it he just tweeted about it out of nowhere and it was a mess from the beginning and now it's it's extended that that idea ideology is extended to other policies including the zero-tolerance policy it is so often he announces policies without checking with his chief of staff or a Secretary of Defense let alone our allies that's because he is a child he's temperamental he doesn't know or care to know how any process works because he's not very bright so he doesn't realize hey actions have consequences and he likes all empathy so he's like those consequences are not for me they're for you so if you're separated from your kid and it turns out you're a US citizen yeah but you're not me I don't care what do I care about I look I care about looking tough and so in this case the US citizen so maybe they were a little embarrassed they shouldn't have done that no for Trump it doesn't really that matter that much with his base he's like look they were brown now he didn't say that but do you see his base up in arms like what are you doing to u.s. citizens we're all created equal I don't really see do you see it yeah I mean the the argument that you hear time and time again from people who support the zero tolerance policy is that liberals prioritize undocumented immigrants over Americans which is not true actually conservatives don't seem to care too much about American citizens either they just use them and exploit them as convenient props when they're making these immigration arguments but with that said I mean you have US citizens caught up in this mess we don't even know if that person is Latino or brown we don't know anything about him right now he's not identified but regardless US citizens are getting caught up in this mess because it's not well thought out it is inhumane and it wasn't planned at all properly at all so if you genuinely do care about anyone's life specifically Americans lives you should be concerned about the incompetence of the Trump administration when they're implementing these policies well alright but finally I give you a small guarantee and a big guarantee the small guarantee is whoever that immigrant that US citizen is that got locked up as an undocumented immigrant when they weren't and had their kids take it from them they're not working okay they ice is not going to white communities in the middle of the country and go alright let's grab a bunch of white people and figure out later if there are immigrants are not immigrants but they are going into random Latino communities in the middle of New York City how is that close to the Mexican border like technically we're within 100 miles of the Canadian border ha got you I'll go terrorize Latino communities in the middle of New York City in the middle of LA etc and let's snatch up some Latinos and see what happens Yeah right so now the big guarantee is whoever it is they have no money right yes yeah and so rich people do not accidentally get detained for a year that never happens ok but if you're poor in this country god help you because if they grab you by mistake and they rip you from your family since you got no resources and the government's a giant bureaucracy it's gonna roll over you and and what happens when you go to any Detention Center whether it's prison or something that's a little different than that hey but I'm a citizen yeah sure you are shut up right because people are in detention have or have no rights okay and and we've been taught oh no you just treat them like animals so I don't depends probably a little bit on what your race is but apparently this can happen to anybody in America and if you don't have the money to be able to fight back God knows how long you stay in detention and God knows how long you're ripped away from your family two easy ways to follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
