00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
hello everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I find out about books</font>

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,179
through wandering around bookshops

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,250
through friends recommendations and also

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,629
because publishers often send me books

5
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,370
in the hope that i will review them but

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,290
this one this one is quite different

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,570
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is one my friend wrote</font>

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,820
this is first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then by Emma Mills it</font>

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,770
comes out on octobre 13 and I can't

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,630
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alma fight has written a</font>

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,350
book<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so so so exciting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also it's</font>

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,029
a really good book I really enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

13
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,680
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a stephanie perkins</font>

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,779
story there's that kind of vibe to it

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,670
but it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more sarcasm and</font>

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,130
it's got a lot of that anxiety around

17
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,170
leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> school leaving high school and</font>

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,300
applying to university in that sense

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,469
that all these people trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,239
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this advice about how you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,660
things and also just having your own

22
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,610
life within that like your priorities

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,200
being different from everyone else's

24
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,969
priorities not because you're a good or

25
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,039
a bad person<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a good or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad student</font>

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,020
but just because it's your life it's not

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,640
anyone else's life and no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> else is</font>

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,379
living it but you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's this</font>

29
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,000
disconnect there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the</font>

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,620
cover into focus for a second it's a hot

31
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,989
of watercolor raindrops or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> absence</font>

32
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,640
of watercolor raindrops it's really

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,709
striking cover I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful I</font>

34
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,240
really excited just to see her<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you</font>

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,280
mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the cover first and then FML</font>

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,290
just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know casual published author</font>

37
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,909
this is very exciting for me I don't

38
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,020
know if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up what this at all</font>

39
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,950
because sometimes because it's like

40
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">those people put them up sitting it's</font>

41
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,189
gonna be like straight romance stories

42
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,810
can be all about romance it's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

43
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,159
different kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of love so there's lots</font>

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,350
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different kinds of love that you can</font>

45
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,119
give to people and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> to yourself and</font>

46
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,710
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that first and then does a</font>

47
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,299
really good job of exploring that the

48
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,770
book doesn't come out til October<font color="#CCCCCC"> 13th</font>

49
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,909
said I want to give too much away but

50
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,579
it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Devin who is as I said kind</font>

51
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sarcastic like this is not like a</font>

52
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,630
cruel kind of sarcasm but there's a

53
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,939
sense that a lot of people are giving

54
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,090
her advice and she feels like she's on

55
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,979
the periphery of it right like she<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels</font>

56
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,299
like she's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of on the periphery of</font>

57
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,579
her life in a little way and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

58
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a common experience for a lot of</font>

59
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in school but it's also just a</font>

60
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,950
common experience of being a person you

61
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,420
always feel like you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outside</font>

62
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,280
yourself in lots of different ways and

63
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,600
she has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of interference in her</font>

64
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,250
life there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people who want her to do</font>

65
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain things and wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

66
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,969
certain plans but she's not in that

67
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,219
mindset but it's very much around her at

68
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,800
the same time so once she is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and isn't</font>

69
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,150
position so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know that a lot you're</font>

70
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,199
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your final year of high</font>

71
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,940
school so I can do school sixth form or

72
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,380
whatever else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you</font>

73
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your final year of</font>

74
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,350
university but for those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as well</font>

75
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,450
you are on the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and</font>

76
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,730
full-fledged adults or pretending to be

77
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,320
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least there is always that sad as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

78
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,580
mentioned kind of being on the outside

79
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and not quite being connected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

80
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,690
things and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

81
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that first and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then does spectacularly</font>

82
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,710
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a bit scary when your</font>

83
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,330
friends make something because you feel

84
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,770
afraid that you're not going to like it

85
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,510
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that feeling of opening</font>

86
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,950
presents in front of other people and I

87
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fear that much but one</font>

88
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,180
of my friends Lex has that fear very

89
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,610
very very keenly she doesn't like

90
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,810
opening presents different of other

91
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,670
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> she doesn't like watching it cuz</font>

92
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,080
she feels uncomfortable for their person

93
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,670
who's opening she's experiencing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

94
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,400
second hand and I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to a</font>

95
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,870
certain degree because that's kind of

96
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,190
how it feels even though my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends are</font>

97
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,140
so talented and so creative and I'm

98
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,190
