1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:09,020
Today’s high-speed trains will have you cruising along at 350 kilometres per hour.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,020
A ticket is about the same as a flight,

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,820
and the door-to-door time on some of the world’s most popular routes

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,460
is the same, or less than getting a plane.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,200
But decades ago rail travel was in decline.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,440
It faced fierce competition from the air and auto industries.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
Then came Japan's bullet train.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,660
By the late 1950s, Japan’s economic miracle had transformed the war ravaged nation.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,660
Its economy was growing quickly.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,040
The area between Tokyo and Osaka was booming with industry.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,860
People were flocking to the capital for work

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,080
but the rail line connecting the two major cities couldn’t take the stress.

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,040
In 1958, a government panel was set up to tackle the problem

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,740
and several potential solutions arose.

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,760
Among them, building the world’s first high-speed rail line.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,460
Many were skeptical, but two men were true believers.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,379
Shinji Sogō was the then president of the state-run Japanese National Railways.

18
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,960
The other, Sogō’s colleague, veteran engineer Hideo Shima.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,960
Up against bureaucratic obstacles and fierce opposition - the two drove the project forward.

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,480
In 1959, the Tōkaidō Shinkansen line started construction under Sogō’s leadership.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,140
Shima was appointed the project’s chief engineer.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,860
His team designed the sleek and revolutionary cone-shaped front -

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,820
from which the bullet train got its name.

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,420
Rather than being pulled by an engine in front,

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,360
each carriage of the bullet train was driven by an individual electric motor,

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,880
which has proven to be safer, faster and more efficient.

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,260
Apart from the train itself, the team also built wider tracks,

28
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,880
which were more costly but allowed for greater stability and higher speeds.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,720
3,000 bridges and 67 tunnels were built on the 515-kilometer line

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,100
to allow a clear and largely curveless path.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,180
Older trains were banned from the new line.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,200
Equipped with advanced technologies, the new trains were able to

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,640
travel as fast as 210 kilometers per hour,

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,620
a breakthrough in the passenger rail industry and the world’s fastest at the time.

35
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,980
The journey time between Tokyo and Osaka was cut from over 6 hours to 4.

36
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,520
On October 1, 1964, the new line opened,

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
just in time for the Tokyo Olympic Games.

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,720
But neither Sogō’ nor Shima were invited for the inauguration.

39
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,500
They both resigned in 1963

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,680
because the project’s budget came in at double what was promised -

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,180
400 billion yen, the equivalent of 3.6 billion US dollars today.

42
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
But despite their premature departure,

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,020
the Tōkaidō Shinkansen line was an immediate success and quickly turned a profit.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,800
It transformed the nation -

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
allowing more people to work in metropolitan areas

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,300
and became a symbol of Japan’s postwar re-emergence as an economic and tech power.

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,420
Now over 300 trains operate on the line everyday.

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,740
And the trip between Tokyo and Osaka has shortened to two and a half hours.

49
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,080
The number of passengers has also soared,

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,800
reaching 165 million in 2016.

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,940
After the success of the Tōkaidō Shinkanse line,

52
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,300
Japan has continued expanding its high-speed

53
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,540
rail network and plans to build more.

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,880
Following Japan’s lead, countries like France, Germany and China

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,340
have also developed high-speed railways.

56
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,260
By the end of 2018, the total length of high-speed

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,020
rail network in the world will be over 46,000 kilometers,

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:00:00,000
and over half of it is in China.
