1
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:10,792
>> Tucker: THE BRETT KAVANAUGH

2
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:11,593
STORY HAS HEARD IT FROM A LOT OF

3
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:12,961
PEOPLE ALREADY BUT THE BIG

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,163
VICTIM MAY BE AMERICA'S BASIC

5
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:15,663
SENSE OF JUSTICE.

6
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:17,799
NORMS LIKE THE PRESUMPTION OF

7
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:19,034
INNOCENCE, DUE PROCESS AND

8
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:21,302
FAIRNESS ITSELF HAVE ALL BEEN

9
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:22,971
SHOVED ASIDE IN A POLITICAL

10
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:23,738
FRENZY.

11
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:25,373
THE QUESTION IS, COULD

12
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:26,408
TOMORROW'S HEARING START TO UNDO

13
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:26,975
THE DAMAGE?

14
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,144
JOINING US NOW AS A MAN WHO HAS

15
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:31,980
RELENTLESSLY DEFENDED FAIRNESS

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,650
AT A GREAT PERSONAL COST, AND HE

17
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,153
IS OF COURSE ALAN DERSHOWITZ,

18
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:39,788
AUTHOR OF THE CASE AGAINST

19
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:40,755
IMPEACHING TRUMP.

20
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,558
AND WE WELCOME HIM NOW.

21
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:44,759
PROFESSOR, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR

22
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,260
COMING ON.

23
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,495
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT NOT AS A

24
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,230
PARTISAN OR SOMEONE WHO VOTES

25
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,865
WITH DEMOCRATS BUT AS SOMEONE

26
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:52,600
WHO CARES ABOUT PRESERVING OUR

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,068
JUSTICE SYSTEM?

28
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:55,737
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE IN THESE

29
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:56,237
HEARINGS TOMORROW?

30
00:00:56,237 --> 00:00:57,939
>> I WANT TO SEE THE GREATEST

31
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:01,009
ENGINE OF TRUTH EVER INVENTED,

32
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:01,810
NAMELY USED A CROSS EXAMINATION.

33
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,578
AND I'M WORRIED THAT WE DON'T

34
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:05,346
HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

35
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,182
THE WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN HIRED TO

36
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:08,583
CONDUCT THE CROSS-EXAMINATION

37
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,385
HAS PROBABLY RARELY EVER

38
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:11,586
CROSS-EXAMINED ANYBODY.

39
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:12,988
SHE'S A PROSECUTOR.

40
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:14,289
PROSECUTORS PUT ON CASES AND

41
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,791
MOSTLY DEFENDANTS DON'T TAKE THE

42
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,091
STAND.

43
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:17,826
SO THIS IS A WOMAN WITH 20 YEARS

44
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,728
OF EXPERIENCE AS A PROSECUTOR

45
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:21,296
BUT NO EXPERIENCE AS A DEFENSE

46
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:23,031
ATTORNEY, SO I DON'T THINK SHE'S

47
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:26,968
THE RIGHT PERSON TO QUESTION

48
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:27,336
DR. FORD.

49
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,403
THERE NEEDS TO BE CROSS

50
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:29,237
EXAMINATION NOT ONLY OF HER BUT

51
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:34,543
OF THE NEW MICHAEL AVENATTI

52
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:36,945
ALLEGATION.

53
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:38,880
THAT AFFIDAVIT IS SO DEEPLY

54
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,617
FLAWED AND OPEN-ENDED THAT GOOD

55
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:42,751
DEFENSE ATTORNEY WOULD BE ABLE

56
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,753
TO TEAR THAT APART IN 30

57
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:45,087
SECONDS.

58
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:46,221
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE LAW

59
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:49,391
THAT ANYONE WOULD FILE AN

60
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,692
AFFIDAVIT LIKE THAT FILLED WITH

61
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:57,466
HARRIS' HEARSAY.

62
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:00,802
BUT THERE WERE WITNESSES AND

63
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:02,938
PEOPLE TOLD ME, I HAVE BEEN TEN

64
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:03,238
TIMES.

65
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:07,075
I WENT BACK AND I KNEW THERE

66
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:08,644
WERE RAPES GOING ON BUT I WENT

67
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:09,144
BACK TO THE PARTY.

68
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:12,648
THIS IS WAS SUCH A DEEPLY FOUGHT

69
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:16,485
AFTER DAY -- >> Tucker: IS

70
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:18,854
THIS AFFIDAVIT, DOES IT CROSSED

71
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:19,722
SOME LINE WHERE THERE COULD BE

72
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,091
PROFESSIONAL QUANT SEQUENCES?

73
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:24,160
>> WHY DON'T THEY GET REACHES

74
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,661
THAT LINE BUT IT CERTAINLY IS AN

75
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:31,333
EXTRAORDINARILY WEAK AFFIDAVIT.

76
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,937
I WANT TO KNOW WHO DRAFTED IT

77
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,806
AND WHO FILLED IN THE GAPS.

78
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:40,176
WAS SHE ASHLEY'S SAYS BY

79
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:43,946
KAVANAUGH THE JUDGE, DID HE SEE

80
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,781
IT, WAS HE IN THE ROOM?

81
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:46,949
IF THERE WERE GANG LIKE THAT,

82
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:53,589
HOW DID IT NOT GET TO THE POLIC

83
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:54,356
POLICE?

84
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:55,057
ANY LAWYER WHO LOVES

85
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:55,758
CROSS-EXAMINATION WOULD LOVE

86
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,394
NOTHING MORE THAN TO EXAMINE A

87
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:59,896
WITNESS HOLDING THAT AFFIDAVIT

88
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:03,332
IN HIS HANDS AND SAYING, HERE?

89
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:03,633
HERE.

90
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,735
BUT HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

91
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:07,570
ALL HE CARES ABOUT IS GETTING

92
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,571
THE HEADLINE, MAYBE SHE WILL

93
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,373
TESTIFY AND MAYBE SHE WON'T.

94
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,108
BUT IF SHE TESTIFIES, SHE WILL

95
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:16,746
BE CROSS-EXAMINED IN A VERY

96
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,882
EFFECTIVE MANNER BY THE CROSS

97
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:23,386
EXAMINER.

98
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,087
>> WHY NOT ASK REAL QUESTIONS

99
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,990
AND WHY NOT SEE THE CLAIMS ALIGN

100
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,191
COMMON SENSE, THEY BECOME SO

101
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,293
INTENSE THAT EVERYONE IS AFRAID

102
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,562
TO ASK REAL QUESTIONS?

103
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,130
>> IT WAS TERRIBLE BECAUSE SHE

104
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,598
HAD A WOMAN SAY ON TELEVISION

105
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,066
THAT IT WAS SEXIST TO HAVE

106
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,601
APPOINTED A WOMAN LAWYER.

107
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,002
SHE WOULD HAVE SAID IT WAS

108
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,504
SEXIST TO APPOINT A MALE LAWYER.

109
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:44,574
YOU NEED A GENERAL NEUTRAL ROBOT

110
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:45,908
NOW TO CROSS EXAMINE IF YOU WANT

111
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:51,447
TO AVOID CLAIMS OF SEXISM, IT'S

112
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:52,014
A "NO" WIN.

113
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:52,915
CROSS-EXAMINATION MUST BE

114
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,283
EFFECTIVE AND IT MUST BE TOUGH.

115
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:55,985
IT HAS TO BE RESPECTFUL.

116
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,589
YOU CAN BE RESPECTFUL AND TOUGH

117
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:00,223
BUT DO NOT PULL PUNCHES.

118
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:02,392
THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE HERE.

119
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,794
A MAN'S LIFE, HIS REPUTATION,

120
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,796
HIS CAREER, HIS FAMILY, THE

121
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,598
WOMEN AND THEIR CREDIBILITY.

122
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,199
THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA HAVING A

123
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,601
JUST SITTING ON THE

124
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,002
SUPREME COURT, THE STAKES ARE

125
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:13,803
TOO HIGH.

126
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:14,504
I DON'T AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS

127
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,072
THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VOTE ON

128
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,074
FRIDAY, I DON'T AGREE WITH

129
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:18,841
REPUBLICANS THAT THERE SHOULD

130
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,442
HAVE TO BE A CONTINUING

131
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:20,942
BACKGROUND CHECK.

132
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,012
NO REASON NOT TO HAVE A

133
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:23,646
BACKGROUND CHECK.

134
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,048
TIME SHOULD NOT BE THE

135
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:26,849
DETERMINING FACTOR WHEN YOU ARE

136
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,451
PUTTING SOMEBODY ON THE

137
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,886
SUPREME COURT FOR A LIFETIME.

138
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,188
TRUTH HAS TO BE THE DETERMINING

139
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:32,522
FACTOR.

140
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:39,295
WE CAN'T LET THIS BOAT HAVE BEEN

141
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,963
UNTIL WE KNOW WHETHER THESE

142
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:40,697
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS DID OR DID

143
00:04:40,697 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT OCCUR AND THERE CAN'T BE A
