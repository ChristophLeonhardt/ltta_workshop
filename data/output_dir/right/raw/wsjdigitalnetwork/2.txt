1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:09,320
What happens when you take one of the
most-streamed songs of all time,

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,660
say, Drake's "One Dance," and record it onto the oldest format of recorded music:

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,449
a wax cylinder. Okay stop, not great. But
fast-forward to today and a lot has

4
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,910
changed. We no longer really own music,
you just stream it. Streaming is almost

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,870
entirely responsible for getting the
industry back on track, but the question

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,000
is now: can streaming take it back to its
heyday after fundamentally changing the

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,479
way we consume it? Maybe.

8
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,850
But first let's look at how we got here.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,700
So back to that phonograph. This was
the start of it all.

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,500
Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow.

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,800
And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,960
Thomas Edison's invention meant that for the first time
people could listen to music from the

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,630
comfort of their homes, and it could also
be shared and sold. As the phonograph's

14
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,700
popularity grew a few enterprising
Americans came together to form what is

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,909
now known today as Columbia Records. Over the next five decades, the phonograph

16
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,759
took different forms from this cylinder
shape to flat disks until finally being

17
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,299
replaced by

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,890
In 1948, Columbia Records introduced the
long-play, allowing for multiple songs on

19
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:01,340
one record. Vinyl remained the dominant
recording format for most of the 20th century

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,970
As rock and roll, blues and
country kicked off sales boomed, and albums

21
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:22,360
sold out. But by the late 50s, new
technology would again rock the industry.

22
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,420
When first introduced the RCA magnetic
tape wasn't a game changer, but being

23
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,980
able to record music on a smaller device
for greater portability inspired a

24
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,100
series of innovation. Adoption by car
makers ensured a quick rise in the tape's

25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,770
popularity, and by the late 60s, most cars
offered 8-track players.

26
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:54,200
For the first first time driving down the interstate
and listening to, say, the Beatles, was

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,300
possible. Road trips got a whole lot more
exciting, but it would be Sony

28
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:10,519
that changed the game with the iconic, yes. With the Walkman listeners could take music with them

29
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,090
with them whenever and wherever. Around the same time, MTV launched, giving record

30
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,870
labels an opportunity to market their
music.

31
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,760
For artists, that meant it wasn't just
about the song anymore, but the ability

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,100
to offer a whole artistic package. And
that became a big focus for icons like

33
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,040
Madonna and Michael Jackson. But with the rise of the digital era came the

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,820
unraveling of the cassette tape.

35
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Thanks to
booming CD sales, the music industry

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,670
parties like it was, yeah, 1999. Profits
peaked that year

37
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:04,600
with $14.6 billion in sales
in the U.S. alone. There was Nirvana and Tupac

38
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,000
The Spice Girls,
Oasis, Backstreet Boys, Britney, Mariah and Selena.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,300
Unfortunately you can only party
like it's 1999 for so long. software like

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,740
Software like Napster paved the way for a new era of piracy.

41
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,180
CD sales plummeted as more and

42
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,250
more people logged on. Free music didn't
sit well with the music industry, and

43
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,720
they fought long and expensive legal
battles, eventually seeing some sites

44
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,700
shut down. But the damage had already
been done. Sharing music over the

45
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,160
Internet was here to stay.

46
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,920
I've got an iPod here.

47
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,490
And true, with the introduction

48
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,110
of the iPod and mp3 players, the industry
did see a boost from digital downloads,

49
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,580
but it wasn't enough to make up for the
dwindling physical format sales And

50
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,890
artists were forced to tour more to
bring in the dough. Meanwhile streaming

51
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,380
was just getting started.

52
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Some companies introduced subscription

53
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,950
models with limited music libraries,
while others, like Pandora, operated as

54
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,830
internet radio stations with ads. But the
breakthrough came in 2011. Swedish

55
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,530
startup Spotify managed to do what the
others could not--license a vast library

56
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,720
of music. Instead of buying and owning
the songs and albums, we started

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,400
listening to ads or paying monthly fees
in exchange for access to essentially

58
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,530
all the music in the world. Over the
following years, there was an explosion

59
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,300
of services artists and labels now count
on these services for the bulk of their

60
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,530
profits from recorded music, while many
argue that artists are not being paid

61
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,740
enough.
Although streaming is responsible for

62
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,180
huge revenue growth in the industry,
tech companies aren't yet making money

63
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,070
from it, and it's still not clear how
they will, as they continue to prioritize

64
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:09,450
growth over profits. Plus, if history is
any clue, it won't be long before new

65
00:06:09,450 --> 00:00:00,000
technology shakes everything up again.
