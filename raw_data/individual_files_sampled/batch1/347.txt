it is huge and it is powerful this is hurricane Florence a scene from space now tracking toward a direct hit on the coast of the Carolinas prompting all kinds of warnings she's a strong girl and she is coming to see us and I don't care what you do you better get ready because she's coming to see us officials are more specific telling 1.5 million people along the Atlantic coast to get out to evacuate to higher ground Florence is intensifying steadily this storm is strong and it's getting stronger it is expected to come ashore as a category 4 hurricane with winds up to 225 kilometers per hour scary statistic but likely not enough to make many leave their homes there are always those who vow to stay behind and try to make it a festive occasion just getting gas and supplies and generator going and everything else and just hunker down and wait it out but with this storm there's more to worry about than winds it's the rain that could cause the most damage if it stalls promising seems like this when hurricane Harvey did the same in Houston that is leading to officials issuing stark warnings we will experience power outages we will have infrastructure damage there will be homes damaged there will be debris on the roads this will be a storm that creates and causes massive damage to our country and it is coming in just a matter of days and much of what you see now could simply be gone in its wake patty contain al-jazeera
