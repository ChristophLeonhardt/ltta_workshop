there's two skills in life to master one skill is the science of achievement your ability like your career to say here's where I want to go here's what I want to do and how I convert my dream into effing reality and the fastest way to do in a course is to not learn by your own experience if you have a career goal the best thing is find a role model who's already achieved what you want or a version thereof or a similar version and then figure out what did they do to do it faster and better than anyone else the science of achievement I think is critical as a way of saying how do I create a magnificent life which is life on your terms but I also working at people what they need and what we need is to be fulfilled success without fulfilment is the ultimate failure in life there's nothing worse than making everybody else happy and you being miserable and that's not a gift to your children that's not a gift to yourself that's not a gift to the person you love in your life you're intimate not a gift to your spirit I think the second skill masks a master it is what I would call the art of fulfillment it's not a science what's gonna excite you or turn you on or fulfill you is different than the person next to you even if they're a dear friend it doesn't matter how much you've achieved and so many people love you so much money you have if you don't keep growing you're not gonna feel alive and happen we grow or we die progress equals happiness in other words if achieving a goal a lot of people cheat the golden it goes this all there is right so they're not fulfilled what you really want to do is it's not the goal that makes you happy what makes you happy is who you become in pursuit of the goal what you get won't make you happy who you become will make you happy or really sad depending upon who you become in the pursuit of what you want I offer you the opportunity to make a decision anybody watch it and it's the most important decision I think a hitman can make the only way to have a great life is decide I'm gonna find beauty and anything that happens in my life cuz you've decided life is too short to suffer you
