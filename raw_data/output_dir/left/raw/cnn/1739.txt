1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
(gentle music)

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,120
- I was fresh out of undergrad

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,459
when I was diagnosed with cancer.

4
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,155
I was being treated in
a children's hospital,

5
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:08,072
so I kind of stuck out.

6
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:10,468
You can tell they're just kind of curious

7
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,125
why you're there, and that kind of

8
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,265
sets up the stage for that shared feeling

9
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,768
we have as young adults
that are diagnosed.

10
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:20,096
You kind of struggle to
find where you fit in.

11
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:22,679
(gentle music)

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,900
- First Descents is a non-profit

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,825
that provides free outdoor adventures

14
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:31,906
to young adults affected by cancer.

15
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,159
Nature's a very objective place,

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,092
it doesn't care whether
or not you've had cancer.

17
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:39,508
And so, it's an incredible
creator of community.

18
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:41,235
We start to see them realize that they're

19
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:42,770
not the only person facing these

20
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,119
challenges that cancer presented.

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,114
- I came to my First Descents program

22
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,779
four months after I finished treatment,

23
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:50,328
and it was like the first moment

24
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,115
that I just basically didn't feel

25
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:56,173
like I was completely helpless and broken.

26
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:57,547
- Coming here during treatment

27
00:00:57,547 --> 00:01:00,033
and finding people that were around

28
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,150
my same age, and who could relate

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,963
was the most powerful thing.

30
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,477
- You know, if you're
talking to your friends

31
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:06,689
it's kind of weird if you're like,

32
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,343
"I don't know if I'll be
able to have children,

33
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:09,635
"and I don't know when I should talk to

34
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,532
"people about this when I go on a date."

35
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:12,733
But having all of you guys, I can

36
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,114
just casually mention stuff like that,

37
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:15,681
and you're like, "Oh yeah
(laughter), totally."

38
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:16,838
(group laughter)

39
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,147
- Since becoming a CNN Hero,

40
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,656
and since getting that Subaru grant,

41
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:21,310
we've expanded into most of the

42
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,988
major cities around the country.

43
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:24,203
The most exciting thing for me

44
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:26,433
is to bring these programs into local

45
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:28,236
communities around the country,

46
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,873
and to actually weave outdoor adventure

47
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:32,128
into their life post-diagnosis.

48
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,839
- As young adults,
when you're diagnosed

49
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,260
with cancer, you're going through

50
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,178
so many defining moments in your life.

51
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:39,810
Like building your identity, and when

52
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,770
your identity is heavily defined

53
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,920
by that cancer experience, First Descents

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,845
kind of helps you break that mold.

55
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:49,098
Now with support from Subaru

56
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,670
we get together as a community

57
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,830
and we don't have to define our lives

58
00:01:54,830 --> 00:00:00,000
through that cancer experience.
