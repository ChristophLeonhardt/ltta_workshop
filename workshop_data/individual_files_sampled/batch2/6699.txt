ten star was the special counsel investigating Bill Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke and because of that investigation the House of Representatives decided to attempt to impeach Bill Clinton now that's important context for the video that you're about to watch recently Ken Starr was interviewed on the issue of impeachment in regard to Donald Trump and here's what he had to say as an INT Trump will face the same fate of President Clinton which is impeachment I hope not because one of the lessons in the book is impeachment is hell the country should not be taken through that the family generation wisely knew that it was such a serious act requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate unless there is a growing national consensus that impeachment is proper it's doomed to fail and it's just the wrong way to go and it's very good so you're happy that President Clinton was not removed from office you think that it worked the way it should have I think the system worked how would I vote it as a senator I think I would have voted to remove him but I can understand full well the interest of the American people and then you know a significant number of the Senators who just said this is not directly related enough what he did they were crimes but it's not directly related enough to his conduct of the presidency and that may happen here we'll we'll see all this that is related thus far has to do with things that happen before the president United States Donald Trump was sworn in you know if you speak in so soft tones on cable news then they will say that you are reasonable but what he said was utterly unreasonable right I mean on one hand you have Bill Clinton who did something wrong there's no question about it but it was two consenting adults who engaged in you know sexual stuff and then that has absolutely no bearing on someone's presidency whereas with Donald Trump this investigation is about obstruction of justice it's about Russian meddling and collusion it has everything to do with the presidency but for some reason Ken Starr thinks no no that would be horrible to impeach Trump but I would have voted to Paige Bill Clinton I mean it's a let's go over Trump's charges in and and Clinton's charges real quick uh potentially by the way it's the jury in a sense has not come in yet on Donald Trump but potential collusion with a foreign actor in the middle of an American election Wow violation of campaign finance laws there is investigations of money-laundering the scale of which we're not clear on yet but it could be significant to say the least and and then there is the payoffs to the mistresses which touches on campaign finance violations and and then there's the issue of perjury his lawyers will not have him testify in front of Muller because according to Bob Woodward's book one who recently left as his lawyer said he was an effing liar lies all the time and he is quoted goddamn dumbbell okay so now the Clinton charges were based on Clinton denying that he had oral sex with Monica Lewinsky so they brought him up on perjury and obstruction of justice because he they claimed he wasn't telling the truth about that and now to be fair he was not telling the truth about that okay he didn't know no oral sex was sex yeah okay yeah we knew that we call that I would call that ridiculous at the time etc do you impeach someone over that I would say no ken starr says yes Ken Starr says that perjury and obstruction of justice even on something so unrelated to the office is bad enough that he would have voted for impeachment but Donald Trump with those lists of potential crimes apparently not serious enough for impeachment wait there has to be a national growing consensus but wait a minute when you did the investigation of Bill Clinton and the Republicans impeached based on your report there was no growing consensus at all Bill Clinton was very popular the impeachment was not popular so none of the things you just said there connect to what your real actions were their hypocrisy knows no bounds so with a straight face he says very calmly well of course I would have voted for the impeachment of Clinton but Donald Trump Oh impeachment is hell we shouldn't go through that now you know Starlite start not so bright damn two easy ways to fall young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos
