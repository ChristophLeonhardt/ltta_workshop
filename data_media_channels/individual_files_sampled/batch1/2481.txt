Yogi Berra said you can't think and hit at the same time and if we're talking about hitting a major league fastball he was absolutely right there just doesn't seem to be enough time for a hitter's brain to process a 95 mile an hour fastball and react quickly enough to hit it the distance from the rubber to home plate is 60 feet six inches subtracting 5 or 6 feet to account for the pitcher stride it takes a fastball traveling at 90 to 95 miles an hour about 400 milliseconds to get from the pitchers hand to the catcher's mitt the batter is already at a disadvantage because it takes the human brain around 80 to 100 milliseconds just to process the image that the eyes are taking in on top of that it's going to take 150 milliseconds on average to get his bat around to meet the ball and 25 milliseconds for his brain to send the signal through his body to swing that leaves him with just 125 milliseconds to gauge the pitch and decide whether or not to go for to put this in perspective it takes 300 to 400 milliseconds just to blink if the pitch looks good the batter has a seven millisecond window to meet the ball in a position where he will put it in play if he's too early or too late the best he can hope for is a foul ball so how is this humanly possible well for one it helps to have good eyesight the average MLB player has 2012 vision and it's a quality scouts look at when assessing players it also helps to get a head start hitters will begin their forward motion before the pitch is delivered they have about 50 milliseconds to decide to check their swing after that the bat will be moving too fast to be stopped but the ultimate trait that helps major leaguers hit the fastball is the ability to see into the future well sort of our brains are really good at anticipating information that we haven't yet received to make up for our lag and vision researchers at UC Berkeley tested this by showing volunteers flash drag illusions like this one if you pause the video you see the red and blue dots actually appear in the same position but while watching it in motion they look slanted in the direction that the background is rotating this is because our brains are predicting the motion of the dots based on the information we're receiving from the movement of the background the same applies in baseball hitters begin predicting the trajectory of the ball based on the movement of the pitcher's arm before it even leaves his hand this makes up for the fact that he won't actually see the pitch until it's a quarter of the way towards him so you have to admit hitting a major-league fastball seems nothing short of superhuman
