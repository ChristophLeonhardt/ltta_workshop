well it had better be or Mohammed bin Sultan is not gonna survive very long and if whoever replaces him doesn't make real he won't survive very long ayat because the world is simply fed up with us you don't have other players in the region with major interests China for example has a Muslim majority western province that Xinjiang province which is populated by a majority of Turkic Muslims cold we Gore's and the Saudis are all over that final tier madrasas they've got of terrorism problem they're not going to tolerate that forever the Russians aren't going to and we won't as a matter of fact one of the few things about which the United States China and Russia all agree is these games on the part of Saudi royals have got to stop so there's certainly a serious effort on the part of the US government to back up the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Sultan and to empower him given the tools to shut down terrorism financing I'm told reliably that the US government has given him what you might call technical assistance remember we have with the Treasury a 700 person team who does nothing but track where money is to introduce inflows to terrorism so we have a lot of capability there it's really up to the Saudis but they had better change or very bad things are going to happen to them all right well I mean if bad things didn't happen to the Saudis after 9/11 and it's sixteen years later and Americans are a little war fatigued I don't know if the bad things are gonna come from the West Russia I mean they seem to be in league with Shiite Muslims in Iran they they seem to Russia has supported Iran it seems to me and their nuclear program in China to to a degree oh absolutely but remember the Chinese and Russians don't have any fights they're all Sunnis the ones who are getting Saudi money are all Sunnis the Russians and Chinese don't care what kind of terrorism the Shiites commit because they don't have any shiites they're fighting firewood fire it's natural for them to Allah with Shiites against the Sunnis because the Sunnis are the threat to that that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
