>> Shannon: WE SHOULD POINT
OUT THAT SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE CHUCK GRASSLEY SEEKING
MORE INFORMATION FROM THE FBI
AND HOW IT USES INFORMANTS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH HOUSE
JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN BOB
GOODLATTE.
CREATE A HAPPY WITH US.
I SAW THE ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY
THAT IN THE COMING DAYS, YOU'VE
SET A DATE FOR HEARING ON THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT THAT
WILL GET NEXT WEEK ON THE
INVESTIGATION INTO
HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS.
THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTIGATING
GOING ON.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO LEARN
FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S
REPORT?
>> THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT
REPORT, WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A
LONG TIME, WAS PROMISED EARLIER
IN THE AIR, APRIL, MAY.
WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL
FINALLY SEE IT, BECAUSE IT WILL
ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT
HOW THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION AND THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE HANDLED THE
INVESTIGATION INTO MATTERS
RELATED TO FORMER PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE AND FORMER SECRETARY
OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON AND
CONTRAST THAT WITH HOW THEY
CONDUCTED THE INVESTIGATION AND
ARE CONTINUING TO CONDUCT THE
INVESTIGATION INTO THE SO-CALLED
TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION, ALLEGING
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT
TO SEE THIS BECAUSE, IN MY
OPINION, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM
THE STRZOK-PAGE TEXT AND OTHERS,
THEY HANDLE V'S TWO MAJOR
MATTERS, WE CAN'T GO INTO
ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
AND HAVE THE WORLD'S PREMIER
LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION
CONDUCTING THEMSELVES THAT WAY.
REFORMS ARE UNDERWAY, PERSONNEL
CHANGES, WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE FACTS, AND THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL WILL HELP US
DO THAT.
>> Shannon: ARE YOU CONCERNED,
SOME LAWMAKERS ARE, AND THE
PRESIDENT CERTAINLY HAS, THIS
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT HAS
BEEN DELAYED.
WE KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
STAKEHOLDERS THEY GET TO SEE IT,
THEY HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO
COMMENT, AND THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL COULD MODIFY
THE REPORT.
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT OR DO
YOU THINK IT IS RUNNING AS
NORMAL COURSE?
>> THAT IS WHY WE WILL HOLD THE
HEARING.
WE'LL SEE THE REPORT, HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL, BOTH THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND THE
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, WITH TREY
GOWDY CHAIRS, WE HOLD A JOINT
HEARING, AND WE'LL DELVE INTO
NOT ONLY WHAT IS IN THE REPORT,
AND A CLASSIFIED SETTING, AND
FOR THE PORTIONS THAT CAN BE
UNCLASSIFIED, AND A PUBLIC
SETTING, BUT ALSO ASK ABOUT THE
PROCESS AND ANY QUESTIONS WE
HAVE ABOUT WHO SAW THIS, ANY
CHANGES THEY MAY HAVE
RECOMMENDED.
>> Shannon: THAT IS PROBABLY
WHAT HE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING,
SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
MODIFICATIONS OF OUR
JAMES COMEY, THAN FBI DIRECTOR,
CAME UP WITH THE WORDING, WHAT
WAS CHANGED.
I'M SURE THOSE THINGS WILL SPELL
OUT.
YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT THOSE
QUESTIONS.
>> WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO ASK YOU
ABOUT THIS MEETING BEHIND CLOSED
DOORS TODAY WITH THE G.O.P. ON
THE HOUSE SIDE, TALKING ABOUT
THE MATTERS OF IMMIGRATION.
IT'S GOTTEN TO A VERY TENSE
LEVEL, IT SOUNDS LIKE TO THOSE
OF US ON THE OUTSIDE.
THE COMPETING INTERESTS ABOUT
WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE ABOUT
SPEED 11, FORCING SOMETHING TO
THE FORE.
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING?
>> WE HAD SOMETHING THAT HAS
BEEN LONG OVERDUE.
WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A MEETING
OF OUR CONFERENCE ON THE CITY,
AND IS NOW COME TO A HEAD
BECAUSE OF THE DISCHARGE
PETITION, BECAUSE OF PRESSURE
FROM ALSO FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS
FROM ALSO FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBER
MEMBERS, AND IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT IS COMING TO A HEAD, IT'S
NOT A GOOD THING IF WE GO INTO A
DISCHARGE PETITION PROCESS
BECAUSE WE COULD GET A VERY
UNBALANCED BILL THAT DOESN'T
REFLECT WHAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS
AND WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT IN TERMS OF
ENFORCEMENT OF OUR IMMIGRATION
LAWS, WHILE ALSO DOING SOMETHING
FOR DACA, WHICH IS WHAT THE BELL
I'VE INTRODUCED ALONG WITH
MIKE MCCAUL AND RAUL LABRADOR
AND MARTHA McSALLY, THE CHEERS
OF THE HOMELAND COMMITTEE, AND
THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF THE
DISCUSSION THIS MORNING.
TELL MIKE OF THE ENTIRE
CONFERENCE.
WE HAD MANY MEMBERS TO SPEAK UP
AND I THINK IT WAS VERY
PRODUCTIVE.
I THINK IT IS LEADING TOWARD THE
CONSENSUS BUT WE ARE NOT THERE
YET.
>> Shannon: CONGRESSMAN STEVE
KING, A FELLOW REPUBLICAN IF
YOURS, SAID EVERY ONE OF THE
BILLS HE SAW HAS AMNESTY IN IT.
HE JUST WANTS TO SEE A BILL THAT
DOES NOT HAVE AMNESTY.
>> MOST PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE
PRESIDENT, HAVE CALLED FOR DOING
SOMETHING APPROPRIATE FOR THE
DACA RECIPIENTS.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE TO -- THAT'S
ONE PILLAR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
FOUR PILLARS.
THE OTHERS, THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE
MET.
SECURING THE BORDER, CLOSING THE
LOOP HOLES ON AMNESTY AND OTHER
ASPECTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,
INTERIOR ENFORCEMENT, AND ALSO
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING
TOWARD A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM BY ENDING EXTENDED FAMILY
CHAIN MIGRATION AND THE VISA
LOTTERY.
THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE ARE
WORKING ON.
HOW YOU DO THAT FOR THE DACA
RECIPIENTS IS THE KEY TO THAT.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL
PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP, AND
OTHER WORDS, SOMETHING THAT ONLY
THEY CAN HAVE, SOMETHING THEY
ARE ELIGIBLE, BUT ANYONE WHO HAS
FOLLOWED THE LAW IS ALSO
ELIGIBLE FOR IT, I THINK THAT IS
A MUCH MORE ACCEPTABLE COURSE OF
ACTION FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF
OUR CONFERENCE.
