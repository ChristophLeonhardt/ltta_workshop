BECAUSE OVERTURNING ROE

94
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:49,644

95
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,746
DAYS OF WOMEN BEING SEVERELY

96
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:53,715

SINGLE DAY THEY WAKE UP AND

104
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,335
THEY DECIDE WHAT THEIR

105
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:15,169

IF TRUMP WINS THE WORLD IS

110
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,209
GOING TO BE OVER.

111
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,610

IT DOESN'T FEEL REAL.

119
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:37,158
THEY'RE ACHE ACTING AND FEAR

120
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,527
