time is ticking away in the key German state of Bavaria the state election campaigns come to a close and even the poll say it's time for a historic change sister party to Angela Merkel's CDU the CSU looks set to lose the dominance it's held in Bavaria since the Second World War even taste and tradition is apparently losing its appeal now the CSU's launched major rallies in the desperate and final attempt to attract voters a voter swing of Angela Merkel's compassionate my grouse stance is expected Bavaria took in the second highest number of asylum seekers out of 16 regions in the country at the height of the migrant crisis twenty thousand arrived at Munich Central Station but everyone was happy about it now the alternative for Germany party or the AFD is on the verge of entering Bavarian Parliament for the first time they're even claiming that the ruling Bavarian party is stealing the campaign talking points this is very well known among the journalists and also among the people that did see is who is kind of copying our program but it says always losing massively losing the people and we got a big part of the electorate if this is the case then the gamble may have backfired those who are more conservative and leaning towards the AFD however those put off by the rhetoric are leaning towards the left towards the green they're expected to come second with 20% of the votes the absolute majority of the CSU will be history whatever the outcome one thing's for sure the vote in Germany's most influential regional governments could have implications in national politics and Merkel's coalition many people and even specialists says this is going to be the end of the coalition in Berlin we heard this already several times in the past and what we see is that everybody in the government is sticking on its chair and especially angle America - so I'm not so sure that the Coalition will fail apart they will try to stay on power as long as possible you
