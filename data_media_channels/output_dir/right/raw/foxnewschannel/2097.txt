1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,482
SURE WE GET THIS INFORMATION WE

2
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:05,584
NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER.

3
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:07,820
>>  CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,121
JOINING US TONIGHT.

5
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:12,958
HERE WITH REACTION, OUR TWO

6
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,661
ESTEEMED ATTORNEY.

7
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:19,265
AN AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK

8
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:20,299
"TRUMPED UP."

9
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,468
GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

10
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,838
JUDGE ELLIS, YOU KNOW HIM WELL.

11
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:28,741
I KNOW HIM WELL FROM A LONG TIME

12
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,077
AGO WHEN I WAS A LITIGATOR.

13
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:34,513
HE'S AN INCREDIBLY TALENTED

14
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:34,813
JUDGE.

15
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:36,181
SENIOR JUDGE ON THE EASTERN

16
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:36,582
DISTRICT.

17
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:39,184
HE JUST LAID INTO THE SPECIAL

18
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:45,257
COUNSEL'S OFFICE.

19
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:48,560
HE SAID, "I DON'T SEE WHAT

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,262
RELATIONSHIP THIS INDICTMENT HAS

21
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:52,498
AGAINST MANAFORT WITH ANYTHING

22
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,500
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,101
AUTHORIZED TO INVESTIGATE.

24
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,504
IT'S UNLIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO

25
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:00,406
PERSUADE ME THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

26
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:03,275
HAS THIS UNFETTERED POWER TO DO

27
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,245
WHATEVER YOU WANT."

28
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:06,362
>>

29
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:06,679
>

30
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:10,482
>>THEY'RE GOING AFTER PEOPLE

31
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:13,185
LIKE MANAFORT AND FLYNN AND COHN

32
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:14,853
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FLIP THEM.

33
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:16,455
THEY WANT TO MAKE THEM SING.

34
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:19,391
AS THE JUDGE PUT IT IN THEIR

35
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:20,826
STATEMENT, MAYBE EVEN MAKE THEM

36
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:21,160
COMPOSE.

37
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,495
I THINK I CAME UP WITH THAT

38
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:23,829
PHRASE.

39
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:27,933
COMPOSING INSTEAD OF SINGING.

40
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,034
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS

41
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,203
JUDGE AND OTHER JUDGES IS THIS

42
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:34,006
JUDGE IS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY

43
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:34,340
HONEST.

44
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,309
HE CALLS IT THE WAY HE SEES IT.

45
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:38,644
THE AMAZING THING IS HE CALLED

46
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:39,111
HIM ON IT.

47
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,846
HE SAID, "YOU CAN'T DO THAT IF

48
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:42,281
YOU'RE A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

49
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,483
YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER DIRECTLY

50
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:45,884
THE EVIDENCE THAT'S WITHIN YOUR

51
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:46,218
MANDATE.

52
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:49,021
YOU CAN'T BE FINDING PEOPLE,

53
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:52,224
CREATING OR EXAGGERATING OR

54
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:54,226
COMING UP WITH CRIMES, NOT IN

55
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:56,662
ORDER TO GET THOSE PEOPLE BUT IN

56
00:01:56,662 --> 00:01:57,763
ORDER TO SQUEEZE THEM AND GET

57
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:59,765
THEM TO SING AND COMPOSE."

58
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:02,768
IT'S ABOUT TIME A JUDGE HONESTLY

59
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:03,802
LOOKED AT THE SITUATION AND

60
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:04,937
ASSESSED IT.

61
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,238
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING

62
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:07,272
ABOUT THIS NOW FOR MONTHS.

63
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,508
WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

64
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,976
BUT IT'S SURPRISING AND

65
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:12,544
REFRESHING THAT A FEDERAL JUDGE

66
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:14,046
WOULD SAY THAT.

67
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:17,583
WHY DID MUELLER TAKE THIS CASE

68
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,184
OUT OF VIRGINIA AND TRY TO PUT

69
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:21,286
IT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.?

70
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:24,623
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE WOULD

71
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:28,827
GET MORE POSITIVE JUDGES AND

72
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,329
JURORS IN THE DISTRICT OF

73
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,097
COLUMBIA THAN VIRGINIA.

74
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:35,968
IN VIRGINIA HE'S GOING TO GET

75
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,803
JUDGES LIKE THIS WHO ARE

76
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:38,170
STRAIGHT.

77
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,005
AND SO CLEARLY THAT WAS JUDGE

78
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:40,706
SHOPPING AND JURY SHOPPING.

79
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:42,841
WHEN I SAID THAT, I WAS CALLED A

80
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:45,043
RACIST AND CONDEMN.

81
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,745
CONGRESSMAN CONDEMNED ME.

82
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:48,247
BUT I THINK THIS OPINION

83
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:49,047
VINDICATES WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING

84
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,016
FOR A LONG TIME.

85
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:54,787
>>  WE DO HAVE ANOTHER ASPECT OF

86
00:02:54,787 --> 00:03:01,627
THE CASE THAT'S STILL IN D.C. I

87
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:02,828
THINK WE LOST HIM.

88
00:03:02,828 --> 00:00:00,000
IF WE GET HIM BACK, LET ME KNOW.
