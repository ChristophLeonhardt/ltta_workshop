that goes in and out the theater and

23
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,960
it's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing but it does mean</font>

24

<font color="#E5E5E5">really special to me to see it and feel</font>

29
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,280
the energy of it the dancers were

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
brilliant the way that the stage was set

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
up was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like there are two audiences and</font>

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,309
stage was in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,170
wonderful production it was very vibrant

35
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,970
but it also was so rich with that

36
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">language and just these things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

37
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,170
very familiar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and it weren't</font>

anything that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen on stage already</font>

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,710
and in much of what I read and watch I

40
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,810
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were just things that</font>

41
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,159
felt like things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mum and my</font>

42
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,560
family had said to me or that I just

culture to me included in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> play was</font>

46
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,570
wonderful it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it felt very very</font>

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,480
buildings behind Kings Cross yeah on a

257
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,690
track on a track but it's it's that it

258
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,180

structure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of ways it is and yet</font>

261
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,150
when you're in the theater yeah it

262
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,890

263
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,600
only notice it when you come behind the

264

performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you fit like is there</font>

268
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,830
something different about this kind of

269
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,990
environment to performing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like a</font>

270
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,610
