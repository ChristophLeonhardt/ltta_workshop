TRUMP, ALAN DERSHOWITZ.

16
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,140
ALAN, YOU SAID I WANT THE FBI TO

17
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,574
LOOK INTO.

18
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:31,076
DO YOU THINK ANYTHING CHANGES

19
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:32,677
AFTER THESE FIVE DAYS IF THINGS

20
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:33,912
CAN'T BE PROVEN?

21
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:36,014
>> WELL I HOPE THEY LOOK INTO IT

22
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:36,381
CAREFULLY.

23
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,183
I THINK THEY OUGHT TO

24
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:40,752
PARTICULARLY LOOK INTO THE

25
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:43,255
SWETNICK AFFIDAVIT PRODUCED BY

26
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:43,755
MICHAEL AVENATTI.

27
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,557
THAT IS THE MOST SERIOUS ONE,

28
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:47,292
CHARGING WITH HIM GANG RAPE,

29
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,561
STANDING ON A LINE, WAITING TO

30
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,729
RAPE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN

31
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:51,062
DRUGGED.

32
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:52,664
I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO

33
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:53,798
INVESTIGATE THAT BECAUSE IF IT

34
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:55,834
TURNS OUT THAT WAS MADE UP OUT

35
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,103
OF WHOLE CLOTH, IT PUTS THE LIE

36
00:00:58,103 --> 00:00:59,704
TO THE NOTION THAT YOU SHOULD

37
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:01,373
BELIEVE ALL VICTIMS, THAT NO

38
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:02,340
WOMEN EVER LIE.

39
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,775
THAT NOTHING IS MADE -- IF IT

40
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:06,878
TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE, THAT IS

41
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:07,479
CLEARLY DISQUALIFYING.

42
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,049
SO I WOULD GET TO THAT CLEARLY

43
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:11,516
AND DECISIVELY.

44
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:12,918
AINSLEY: WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?

45
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:14,686
YOU BASED ON, YOU SAW HER ON

46
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:16,521
CAMERA WITH MICHAEL AVENATTI.

47
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:17,989
YOU SAW HIM IN THE HEARING THAT

48
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,091
IS A FARCE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

49
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:20,492
THIS WOMAN?

50
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:22,294
>> WELL YOU HAVE TO, SHE SAYS

51
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:24,963
SHE HAS WITNESSES TO CONFIRM IT.

52
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:26,131
MICHAEL AVENATTI HAS WITNESSES

53
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:27,499
BUT WON'T NAME THEM.

54
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:32,037
THE FBI OUGHT TO GO TO AVENATTI.

55
00:01:32,037 --> 00:01:35,907
AVENATTI SHOULD WAIVE ANY LAWYER

56
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:37,476
CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND LET THE FBI

57
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:38,844
FIND OUT WHAT THE ORIGINAL STORY

58
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:39,111
WAS.

59
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,479
WHETHER IT WAS CHANGED AS THE

60
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,848
RESULT OF COORDINATION WITH HIM

61
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:44,182
OR WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

62
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:47,552
LOOK, YOU KNOW THE MYTH OUT

63
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,855
THERE THIS IS JOB INTERVIEW.

64
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:50,222
NONSENSE.

65
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:52,624
IF IT WAS A JOB INTERVIEW YOU

66
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:54,693
DON'T START WITH JOB INTERVIEW

67
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:56,595
HALF THE POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS

68
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,797
SAYING THEY WON'T HIRE YOU UNDER

69
00:01:58,797 --> 00:01:59,331
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

70
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:00,766
ONCE A PERSON IS ACCUSED

71
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:03,235
PUBLICLY OF SPECIFIC, FOCUSED

72
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,037
CRIMES THAT ARE

73
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:08,774
CAREER-DESTROYING, THAT JOB

74
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:10,074
INTERVIEW METAPHOR DISAPPEARS.

75
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,176
YOU HAVE TO PROVE THE

76
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,277
ALLEGATIONS BY CLEAR AND

77
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:14,579
CONVINCING EVIDENCE WITH DUE

78
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:14,980
PROCESS.

79
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,414
STEVE: RIGHT.

80
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:17,149
>> IMAGINE IF THE SITUATION WERE

81
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:17,983
DIFFERENT?

82
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:21,887
IMAGINE IF A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT

83
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,522
PRESIDENT APPOINTED THE FIRST

84
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,256
MUSLIM-AMERICAN TO THE SUPREME

85
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:25,691
COURT, SOMEBODY SAID, OH, YEAH,

86
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,225
I REMEMBER HE WAS A TERRORIST

87
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,994
WHEN HE WAS 17.

88
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:31,563
THE ACLU WOULD BE ALL OVER THIS

89
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:31,863
CASE.

90
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:33,699
NO YOU CAN'T PRESUME GUILT OF

91
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,066
TERRORISM.

92
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,000
EVERYBODY WOULD BE SAYING THE

93
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,535
BURDEN OF PROOF IS SO HEAVILY

94
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:37,936
BUT WHEN THE SHOE IS ON THE

95
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:39,871
OTHER FOOT, WHEN IT IS A WHITE

96
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,876
MAN BEING ACCUSED BY THE LEFT OF

97
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,911
SEXUAL OFFENSES ALL THE RULES

98
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:46,745
ARE CALLED OFF.

99
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:48,547
THE RULES OF PRESUMPTION OF

100
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:48,914
INNOCENCE.

101
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:50,282
THE RULES OF DUE PROCESS.

102
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:51,650
WE KNOW HE IS GUILTY BECAUSE HE

103
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,619
IS A WHITE MAN, SHE'S A WOMAN,

104
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:54,920
SHE IS A SURVIVOR.

105
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,856
THAT IS THE END OF THE INQUIRY.

106
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,425
STEVE: ALAN, EXIT QUESTION, IF

107
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:00,826
NO NEW INFORMATION IS

108
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:01,927
DISCOVERED, DOES IT GET

109
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,429
CONFIRMED, QUICKLY?

110
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:05,197
>> IT IS UP TO FOUR PEOPLE.

111
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:07,199
AND I WOULD THINK IF NO NEW

112
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,168
EVIDENCE COMES OUT, THEN THE

113
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:10,669
BURDEN OF PROOF HASN'T BEEN

114
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:11,937
SATISFIED AND BECAUSE THIS WAS

115
00:03:11,937 --> 00:00:00,000
PUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, HE
