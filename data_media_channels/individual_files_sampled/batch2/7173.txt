under the guise of a commitment to new forms of innovative job training the Trump administration is going to hand literally hundreds of millions of dollars over to private businesses to conduct new forms of apprenticeships and of course as with many of the other topics on today's show it will be done without any oversight whatsoever so this move is going to a develop government funded apprenticeship programs from the Labor Department now those are being moved over to third-party private entities including trade groups labor unions I'm surprised they actually put those in there and private businesses as well the third parties are going to set their own bar for success with these programs and submit their metrics to the Labor Department for approval an approval private process that I predict will be rigorous yeah totally I like that a lot again how do you crack that code get approval bad I've got the zip just make sure you dot your T's and rasterizer record this is still useful got in fact it's a larger use of government funds than previous than previously yes so that's the good sign theoretically and that's what they'll focus on is that they're actually doing more money so Trump is going to redirect over 100 million dollars of federal job training money to pay for the new apprenticeships uh there will also be 90 million dollars in new funding uh or funding it for the existing program uh so 2092 two hundred ninety two hundred with the basically the new hundred and ten yeah for the new pro so you hear that and you think okay there's some funding going to these apprenticeships and maybe we'll check back in a couple years and it'll be great but you're taking money that was going to a variety of different job training programs which was managed and had oversight by the government and instead you're giving these private businesses and theoretically yes labor unions as well car plows should do their own programs and not only are you funding that but this isn't new money the money's coming from existing job training programs so if this is a disaster it's not just a disaster it's a disaster for the programs that we've already been relying on so this looks like an amazing way to throw a couple of hundred million dollars in businesses and they just get that money and they set up the criteria for whether the or success or not and look compared to some of the other stories we cover okay a couple hundred million dollars isn't as much as we're usually seeing but it's still a pretty good payday for these businesses they will get this money and by the way in addition to the money being moved from job training programs to the new apprenticeships overall the president's proposed budget would impose a 36 percent cut to job training programs so what remains is largely it looks like being taken over by these private business apprenticeship programs and so again I mean this is a time when he loves to talk about the coal industry they opened up a coal mine yesterday we reported on and that's great the jobs it will provide are great all 70 of them but there's a lot of people who over a hundred thousand jobs in loss in just the past couple years the industry they need job training this is not the solution in fact it D funds the solution yeah I mean if the guy if there were a private business that were prepared to do job training they'd probably be more interested right uh and it may be maybe it'll work out but it sounds like a great way to transfer taxpayer money to private businesses they can do it all they want with it Trump's gonna be pretty disappointed when he learns that uh this executive order he sign did not call for episodes the apprentice to be filmed on a ship true yeah I think is that he was guy guy that that's the kind of thing he would get the hot uh uh that would be cool mix it up a little bit maybe do the firings on a beach or something like that but yeah you're gonna hear a lot about this they're gonna they're gonna say this is a massive win but right now it looks like an unqualified disaster you don't like ads I hear your brother you know how you could avoid as for the Young Turks become a Young Turks member get all the content add free tea white tea network.com slash join
