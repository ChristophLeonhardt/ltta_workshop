BACK IN 2016 DURING THE
DEBATES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND
HILLARY CLINTON A MAN STOOD UP
AND ASKED THE QUESTION.
HIS NAME WAS KEN BONE AND HE WAS
CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE POLICIES
WERE IN REGARD TO THE
COAL INDUSTRY.
HE AT THE TIME WAS A COAL POWER
PLANT OPERATOR, HIS JOB WAS
ON THE LINE AND HE WAS
CONCERNED.
HE BECAME A MEME INSTANTLY
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT HE
LOOKED THE WAY HE DOES.
THE RED SWEATER, THE
MUSTACHE, THE GLASSES.
HE WAS UNDECIDED IN REGARD TO
WHO HE WOULD VOTE FOR AT
THE TIME.
HE IS BACK IN THE NEWS TODAY
BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE TWEET HE PUT
OUT DURING THE STATE
OF THE UNION.
IT WAS DURING TRUMP'S STATEMENTS
ABOUT THE COAL INDUSTRY.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON
AMERICAN ENERGY AND WE HAVE
ENDED THE WAR ON BEAUTIFUL,
CLEAN COAL.
>>SO WHAT DOES KEN BONE THINK AS
SOMEONE WHO WAS EMPLOYED BY THE
COAL INDUSTRY?
HAVE WE ENDED
THIS WAR ON BEAUTIFUL CLEAN
COAL?
>> HERE IS 
MORE BACKGROUND.
PEOPLE DUG INTO HIS BACKGROUND.
HE IS A PRIVATE CITIZEN.
IF YOU DIG INTO ANYONE'S
BACKGROUND, YOU WILL FIND
SOMETHING DAMAGING ABOUT THEM.
YOU CAN DO IT TOO LITERALLY
ALMOST ANYONE.
BUT BONE DID NOT ASK TO BE
A PUBLIC FIGURE.
THEY DUG IN AND FOUND
DAMAGING STUFF.
APPARENTLY SOME STUFF ABOUT
EROTIC PHOTOS, I DON'T REMEMBER.
I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER.
THEN THEY FOUND THAT HE HAD SAID
TRAYVON MARTIN'S KILLING
WAS JUSTIFIED.
IT MAKES MY HAIR STAND ON EDGE.
I WANT TO HATE KEN BONE.
I DON'T WANT THE COUNTRY,
PRIVATE CITIZENS RIPPING EACH
OTHER APART.
I KNOW IT IS CLICH…
BUT YOU ARE GOING TO AGREE ON
MOST STUFF AND IT IS THE
POLITICIANS THAT DO THE
PROPAGANDA THAT SPLIT US.
MY FAVORITE ISSUE, THE ONE THAT
IS MOST IMPORTANT, MONEY IN
POLITICS.
BUT KEN BONE TO ME ñ I
SAY THAT AS CONTEXT FOR I AM NOT
A KEN BONE FAN.
BUT HE IS IN A SENSE THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN, AND THAT IS WHAT
HE RESONATED AT THE
TIME THAT HE DID.
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WHO DOESN'T
KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT POLITICS.
IN REALITY THERE IS A GIANT
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM, AND
THEY ARE BOTH IN THEIR
OWN WAY LOANSOME.
HE OBVIOUSLY
HAD SOME CONSERVATIVE LEANINGS
BASED ON THE TRAYVON
MARTIN THING.
YOU CAN'T JUST
CARICATURE PEOPLE BASED ON ONE
THING THEY HAVE SAID EVEN AS
DEEPLY TROUBLING AS THAT COMMENT
ABOUT TRAYVON MARTIN IS.
NOW HE
WAS LOOKING AT WHAT TRUMP HAS
DONE AND SAYS THAT IS NOT AT ALL
WHAT YOU PROMISED, OR WHAT YOU
ARE SAYING TODAY.
THERE IN LIES THE STORY OF
DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL CAREER.
MORE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY
REALIZE THIS IS NOT WHAT HE
PROMISES.
THIS GUY IS NOT WHAT
HE CLAIMED TO BE.
>> DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION
THERE WAS A LENGTHY PORTION
WHERE TRUMP APPLAUDED HIMSELF
FOR PASSING THESE TAX CUTS
FOR THE WEALTHY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A POOR
POLITICAL STRATEGY TO EMPHASIZE
THAT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH
A DEEPLY UNPOPULAR BILL.
AND ALSO AMERICANS ARE GOING TO
NOTICE THAT THEIR WAGES ARE
STAGNANT.
THEY WILL NOTICE THAT THEIR TAX
CUTS WILL EXPIRE WHILE THE
TAX CUTS FOR CORPORATIONS OF THE
TOP 1% WILL BE PERMANENT.
THE LONGER HE IS IN OFFICE, THE
MORE HIS POLICIES REALLY SET IN
AND GIVE AMERICANS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE HOW
DESTRUCTIVE AND DAMAGING THEY
ARE, THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME
PORTION OF HIS VOTERS THAT WILL
FLIP.
BUT THEN THERE IS
THAT CORE BASE.
ESPECIALLY THE RELIGIOUS VOTERS
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN
PREVIOUS SHOWS THAT GENUINELY
THINK TRUMP WAS PUT IN
OFFICE BY GOD HIMSELF.
THOSE PEOPLE WILL NEVER FLIP.
IT
DOESN'T MATTER IF THEIR WAGES
ARE STAGNANT, OR HAVING TROUBLE
PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE, IF
THEY LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE, IF
THEY LOSE THE GOVERNMENT AID
THEY GET BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY WORKING FULL-TIME
AT A COMPANY LIKE WALMART.
IT DOES NOT MATTER, AND THAT IS
THE MOST DEVASTATING PART OF IT.
>> THE ONES BETWEEN THE 40%
THAT DONALD TRUMP PEAKS AT, IN
THE LATEST POLL HE IS AT 42.
AN ELECTION DAY THERE WAS A
PULLED THAT HAD HIM ON 37.
25% WHICH IS HIS MINIMUM,
THAT GOT HIM INTO OFFICE.
THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT, KEN
BONE IS IN THAT MIDDLE AREA
BETWEEN 25% AND 40%.
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
TRUMP STAYING IN OFFICE AND
NOT STAYING IN OFFICE.
WHETHER IT IS THROUGH
IMPEACHMENT OR THE 25TH
AMENDMENT.
LOSING THE CAN BONES OF THE
WORLD DOES MAKE A
DIFFERENCE, IT MAKES A
GIANT DIFFERENCE.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
40 AND 25 IS 40
IS BARELY HANGING IN THERE.
25 IS DEVASTATING.
THE CLOSER HE GETS TO 25,
THE CLOSER HE GETS TO
LEAVING OFFICE.
THAT IS WHY STORIES LIKE
THIS ARE IMPORTANT.
