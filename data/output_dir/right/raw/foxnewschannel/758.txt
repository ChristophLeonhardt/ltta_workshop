1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,842
LOVING HOME AND THERE'S NO SUCH

2
00:00:02,842 --> 00:00:04,144
THING AS AN UGLY DOG.

3
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:06,012
>> THAT'S A PRETTY UGLY DOG.

4
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:07,447
I HAVE TO AGREE.

5
00:00:07,447 --> 00:00:08,815
>>> THE POLITICAL DIVIDE IN OUR

6
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:10,917
COUNTRY REACHING NEW LOWS.

7
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:12,986
SARAH SANDERS KICKED OUT OF A

8
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:13,987
RESTAURANT FRIDAY NIGHT, JUST

9
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:15,588
FOR WORKING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

10
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,724
WHILE ACTOR SETH ROGEN REFUSES

11
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,526
TO TAKE A PHOTO WITH FORMER

12
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:21,861
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN AND BERATES

13
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:23,997
HIM IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN.

14
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:26,499
IS THERE ANY WAY TO REVERSE THE

15
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:28,935
PERSONAL ATTACKS AND GET BACK TO

16
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,136
DISAGREEING RESPECTFULLY?

17
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:33,006
LET'S ASK OUR PANEL, FOUNDER OF

18
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:41,347
THE FLIP SIDE DOT I.O., ANAPI

19
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:44,984
WYHEAD AND EMILY COMPAGNO.

20
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:45,685
>> GOT IT.

21
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:47,253
>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

22
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:49,823
EMILY, I'LL START WITH YOU.

23
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:51,391
THIS PUBLIC CONFRONTATIONS OF

24
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,759
PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THEIR KIDS,

25
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,694
IN RESTAURANTS, IS THIS WHAT THE

26
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:55,595
RESISTANCE HAS COME TO?

27
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:57,797
>> IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS.

28
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,132
WHAT'S SO TROUBLING TO US IS

29
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:02,969
THAT IT'S SO HYPOCRITE CALL

30
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:03,069
THAT IT'S SO HYPOCRITEICALL

31
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,336
THAT IT'S SO HYPOCRITEICAL FOR

32
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:05,305
THE REASONS THAT THE LEFT SAYS

33
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:09,008
THE RIGHT IS SO REPULSIVE, WHICH

34
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,543
IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE

35
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:10,977
DEMONSTRATING.

36
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:13,113
WHAT SADDENS ME IS THE PLATFORMS

37
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,215
THAT -- AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

38
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:16,850
THOSE PEOPLE REFUSE TO TAKE,

39
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,088
WHAT IT DOES IS IT DOES A

40
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:22,489
DISSERVICE.

41
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,590
SETH ROGEN COULD HAVE USED A

42
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,291
PLATFORM TO SAY SPEAKER RYAN I

43
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,460
WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS MORE ABOUT

44
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,162
ALZHEIMERS AND TAKE A PHOTO

45
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:31,698
TOGETHER AND SAY AT LEAST THIS

46
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:34,334
WE CAN AGREE ON.

47
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:35,635
INSTEAD, IT'S A LOST OPPORTUNITY

48
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,771
TO ENGAGE AND DISCUSS AND,

49
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:40,473
AGAIN, FURTHER WHAT SHOULD BE

50
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:41,474
RESPECTFUL DISCOURSE.

51
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:47,347
>> HOW MUCH FALLS ON LEFT WING

52
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:47,847
LEADERSHIP.

53
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:49,382
THEY SCREAM IMPEACH 45.

54
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:51,985
THEN YOU SEE RANK AND FILE FOLKS

55
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,052
WHO OWN RESTAURANTS MIRRORING

56
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:53,486
THAT CONDUCT.

57
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:55,655
>> WHEN YOU DISAGREE WITH

58
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:59,159
SOMEONE ON THE LEFT, IT'S

59
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,093
INSTANT DISCOMMUNICATION.

60
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:02,295
THEY ARE DEHUMANIZING PEOPLE WHO

61
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:02,762
ARE REPUBLICANS.

62
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,998
THERE WAS A CONTROVERSY ABOUT

63
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,232
THE BORDER, DIFFERENCE OF

64
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:07,233
OPINION.

65
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:07,967
REPUBLICANS WEREN'T JUST WRONG

66
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,836
BECAUSE THEY HAD A BAD POLICY.

67
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,439
THEY WERE COMPARED TO NAZIS AND

68
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:13,840
TERRORISTS.

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,177
IT SHOULDN'T BE S OR

70
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:17,377
IT SHOULDN'T BE A OR

71
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:17,410
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SR

72
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,912
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE WHEN

73
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:22,515
WE SEE BUSINESS OTHERS

74
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:22,982
DISCRIMINATING.

75
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:24,350
>> YOU SAY THERE'S A BIT OF A

76
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,452
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED

77
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:27,387
WITH SETH ROGEN AND WHAT

78
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:30,523
HAPPENED WITH SARAH SANDERS.

79
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:30,790
WHY?

80
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,961
>> SETH ROGEN DID NOT BEHAVE IN

81
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:37,197
WAY WE WOULD HOPE.

82
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:39,599
WE HAVE SETH ROGEN WHO IS

83
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,034
EXERCISING HIS FREEDOM OF

84
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:42,635
EXPRESSION OR NOT TO IN THIS

85
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:44,637
CASE, AS WE ALL A KNOW, A SINGLE

86
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:47,874
PHOTO CAN GENERATE A THOUSAND OP

87
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:48,141
EDS.

88
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:50,109
IF HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN

89
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:51,845
ENDORSING PAUL RYAN, I THINK

90
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,047
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM A BUSINESS

91
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:56,082
REFUSING SERVICE TO A GROUP OF

92
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:58,518
PEOPLE BECAUSE POLITICAL

93
00:02:58,518 --> 00:02:58,985
BELIEFS.

94
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,054
THAT TO ME IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

95
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,056
>> IS THIS SOMETHING LIBERALS

96
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,591
HAVE SEEN FROM CONSERVATIVES OR

97
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:05,692
ARE THEY SEEING IT NOW BECAUSE

98
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,594
THEY HATE TRUMP SO MUCH, THEY

99
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:09,329
WILL DO ANYTHING THEY CAN AT ANY

100
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:09,629
LEVEL?

101
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,064
>> THERE IS AN OUTRAGE MACHINE

102
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:11,664
ON BOTH SIDES.

103
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:12,999
I THINK WE ARE GETTING CLOSER

104
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,201
AND CLOSER EVERY DAY TO THE

105
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:15,501
BRINK.

106
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:18,338
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE LESSON

107
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:19,639
MANY PEOPLE TOOK FROM THE 2016

108
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,640
ELECTION ON THE LEFT IS THAT

109
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,412
HALF THE COUNTRY IS SOME DISSHOW

110
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:32,852
NARROW MINDED OR BIGOTED.

111
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:34,387
WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO GO TO

112
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:34,988
THE NEGATIVE.

113
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:36,222
INSTEAD, WE SHOULD SAY HERE'S

114
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:38,124
WHY WE THINK WE ARE RIGHT.

115
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:45,098
>> THEY ARE BLINDED BY HATRED.

116
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,699
IMAGINE IF YOU SAID THIS, YOU

117
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,301
WOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

118
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:49,502
YOUR FAMILY WOULD BE ASHAMED OF

119
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,970
YOUR C THIS IS THE LEVEL WHICH

120
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,771
IT HAS COME TO.

121
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:52,839
YOU CAN'T JUST LIKE PRESIDENT

122
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,807
TRUMP OR THINK HE'S DOING A GOOD

123
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:55,074
JOB.

124
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:56,509
YOU ARE EVIL, YOU ARE WRONG WITH

125
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,111
YOU SUPPORT HIM.

126
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,545
>> THANKFULLY, NOT MANY PEOPLE

127
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:03,883
WATCH MORNING JOE.

128
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:07,320
EMILY, KRISTEN NIELSEN, AT A

129
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,554
RESTAURANT, SCREAMED AT OUTSIDE

130
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:11,858
OF HER HOME, PROTESTERS GOING AT

131
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:12,158
HER.

132
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:13,092
HERE'S A PICTURE OF WHAT

133
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:14,928
HAPPENED TO HER AT A MEXICAN

134
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:15,428
RESTAURANT.

135
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:16,995
EVERYONE'S POINTING OUT THE

136
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,965
SO-CALLED IRONY THAT HOW SUDDENC

137
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:19,999
SO-CALLED IRONY THAT HOW SUDDENU

138
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:20,266
SO-CALLED IRONY THAT HOW SUDDEND

139
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,801
SHE BE AT A MEXICAN RESTAURANT

140
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,303
WITH THE POLICY THAT'S ARE AT

141
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,470
THE BORDER.

142
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,738
SHOULDN'T WE BE ABLE TO SEPARATE

143
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:27,240
THE PRIVATE OPPORTUNITY FOR

144
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,975
PEOPLE TO HAVE A MEAL AND THE

145
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:30,009
POLICIES THEY ARE PURSUING?

146
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,477
>> YOU WOULD THINK SO.

147
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,413
I THINK THE PERSPECTIVE HAS BEEN

148
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,114
REDUCED TO SUCH A SINGLE

149
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:36,783
DIMENSIONAL VIEWPOINT.

150
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,284
SAUDI ARABIA JUST LIFTED THEIR

151
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:40,320
BAN ON WOMEN DRIVERS ON FRIDAY.

152
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,455
NOW WE HAVE THE MEDIA DISSECTING

153
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:43,723
THE FURTHER LADY'S JACKET.

154
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:45,425
THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN REDUCED

155
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,961
TO A SINGLE PHOTOGRAPH OR SINGLE

156
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:48,494
SOUND BITE.

157
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:51,597
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND

158
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:54,133
NUANCED -- THE ENGAGEMENT WOULD

159
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,969
FOSTER A BENEFIT TO EVERYONE.

160
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:57,870
EVERY ISSUE HAS SO MUCH MORE TO

161
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,171
IT.

162
00:04:58,171 --> 00:04:59,605
INSTEAD IT'S REDUCED TO YELLING

163
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:00,606
SHAME AT A RESTAURANT.

164
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,942
I POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THE HE

165
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:04,978
PROTESTS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED

166
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:08,881
TOWARD FEMALE GOP PARTICIPANTS

167
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:11,417
AND ELECTIONED OFFICIALS.

168
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,418
>> VERY INTERESTING POINT.

169
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,654
WOULD THE SAME CONDUCT EVER BE

170
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:15,822
TOLERATED AGAINST FEMALE MEMBERS

171
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:17,190
OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OR

172
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,757
OBAMA HIMSELF.

173
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:19,625
I THINK THE QUESTION ANSWERS

174
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:19,959
ITSELF.

175
00:05:19,959 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS
