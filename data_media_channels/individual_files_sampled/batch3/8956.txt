DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT JOHNSON SHOULD RESIGN? SOMEONE SHOULD ASK YOU THE QUESTION BECAUSE OF WAY YOU FORMULATE THE QUESTION. Martha: INTERESTING QUESTIONS ON BOTH SIDE. WE'RE JOINED BY DAVID BOSSI, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR WHO SPENT TIME AS LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON CONGRESSIONAL PROBABLIES IN THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE. LANNY DAVIS, THE FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT CLINTON WHO BECAME WELL KNOWN FOR DEFENDING HIM IN THE LEWINSKY SCANDAL AND HE IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "THE UNMAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016." WELCOME. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BOTH WITH US TONIGHT. YOU BOTH HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA. LANNY, DOES PRESIDENT CLINTON NEED A NEW ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION NOW? I'M GOING TO GIVE ONE COMMENT ON THIS TOPIC. PRESIDENT CLINTON APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PUBLICLY. HE APOLOGIZED TO MISS LEWINSKY AND HER FAMILY PUBK PUBLICLY AND HE APOLOGIZEDDED TO HIS WIFE AND FAMILY. BY THE TIME HE LEFT OFFICE THE AMERICAN'S PEOPLE JUDGMENT WAS 65% APPROVAL RATING. THE HIGHEST OF ANY SECOND TERM PRESIDENT SINCE POLLS WERE INVENTED. THAT IS ABOUT ALL I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THAT TOPIC. Martha: UNDERSTOOD. DAVID, LET ME GET YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS. IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO THE PART THAT HE SAYS I LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE $16 MILLION IN DEBT. DON TRUMP JUNIOR TWEETED ABOUT THAT TODAY. HE SAID, "DID BILL CLINTON JUST #MeToo MONICA LEWINSKY? THE FIRST MALE TO CLAIM VICTIM VICTIMHOOD." DAVID? HE IS THE VICTIM HERE. HE IS THE VICTIM AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO USED HIS POSITION OF POWER OVER A 20-YEAR-OLD INTERN. HE IS THE VICTIM AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. BILL CLINTON ONLY, BILL CLINTON ONLY ADMITTED THE TRUTH WHICH WAS THAT HE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH MONICA LEWINSKY ONLY BECAUSE THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR GOT A SUBPOENA TO DRAW HIS BLOOD TO FORCE HIM TO ADMIT THAT HE LEFT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE ON A BLUE DRESS. THAT IS HOW DISGUSTING THE FACTS WERE THAT WE HAD TO DEAL WITH IN THE '90s. Martha: IN TERMS OF THE BROADER INVESTIGATION, AT THE TIME YOU FOUGHT VERY HARD AGAINST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL KEN STARR. YOU SAID HE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. THAT THERE WASN'T A SCINTILLA OF EVIDENCE AGAINST BILL CLINTON IN THE PAULA JONES CASE AND NOW OTHERS ARE CONCERN AND SAYING I LIVED THROUGH THIS AND IT IS WRONG AND WHAT IS HAPPENING AGAIN. DO YOU AGREE WITH MARK PENN? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE SAID. HE IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. Martha: HE HAS WRITTEN FIVE OR SIX COLUMNS THAT SAYS HE THINKS THE INVESTIGATION IS OUT OF CONTROL. I JUST SAID I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MARK PENN SAID. HE IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ONE YEAR. AT ONE YEAR INTO WATERGATE, PRESIDENT NIXON SAID ONE YEAR IS ENOUGH. LET'S CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION. ONE YEAR LATER HE RESIGNED. I THINK MR. MUELLER IS HIGHLY RESPECTED. TREY GOWDY I NEVER THOUGHT I'D QUOTE, DAVID, IN PRAISE AFTER WHAT HE DID ON BENGHAZI. TREY GOWDY HAS TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP THE FOLLOWING "IF YOU ARE NOT GUILTY, THEN ACT LIKE IT." SO LET'S LET MR. MUELLER DO HIS JOB. LET ME CORRECT YOU ON ONE THING. THAT IS THAT THIS INVESTIGATION WILL HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS THIS AUGUST. TWO YEARS. THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE STARTED THEIR INVESTIGATIONS IN AUGUST OF '16. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT. YES, MUELLER HAS BEEN IN OFFICE JUST OVER A YEAR. BUT THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS. ONE YEAR. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS AND THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF ANY COLLUSION. THAT IS WHAT THIS INVESTIGATION WAS ABOUT. THIS WASN'T ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PAUL MANAFORT AND WHAT HE DID TEN YEARS AGO. EVEN THOUGH HE IS GOING TO BE CONVICTED IT LOOKS LIKE ON OTHER ISSUES. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE CAMPAIGN'S COLLUSION. THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S POINT. HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. Martha: ALSO JUST TO THAT WAS AN INTERVIEW I DID WITH TREY GOWDY. THE PART THAT DOESN'T GET PICKED UP A LOT IS HE SAID I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP DID ANYTHING WRONG. HE SAID FROM EVERYTHING WE ARE SEEING THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT HE DID ANYTHING WRONG. I DON'T THINK IS CERTAINLY FAIR BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FACTS YET. MY FRIEND DAVID Martha: YOU SAY HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU SAID HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. WHO SAID THAT? Martha: YOU JUST SAID IN THE LAST BREATH YOU DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS. WHO SAID HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED? I DID NOT SAY THAT. Martha: YOU HAVE SAID THAT. I SAID HE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. I DON'T KNOW IF HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. MY BOOK, THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING, MARTHA, CALLS FOR AN INVESTIGATION. AND MY FRIEND DAVID, WE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS OVER THE YEARS FORGOT TO MENTION THAT KEN STARR INVESTIGATED BILL CLINTON AND MRS. CLINTON FOR SEVEN YEARS AND $60 MILLION. BACK THEN DAVID WASN'T COMPLAINING. THAT IS BECAUSE BILL CLINTON HAD ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER. ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATIONS WE EVER SAW. LOOK AT HOW MANY INDEPENDENT COUNSELS THERE WERE. LOOK AT HOW MANY DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIONS THERE WERE. THERE WERE CORRUPTION AT EVERY TURN. THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION, YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR SOME FACTS. BUT THERE IS NONE THERE. THAT HAS BEEN THE PRESIDENT'S POINT THE ENTIRE TIME. Martha: LET ME LET'S WAIT FOR THE FACTS TO COME OUT. THE LAST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AFTER MR. STARR FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF ANY CRIMINAL WRONGDOING BY EITHER MRS. CLINTON DESPITE ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS, ENDED UP IN A BIG ZERO. Martha: ALL RIGHT. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT JAMES COMEY BECAUSE I KNOW IN YOUR BOOK "THE UNMAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016." BY THAT YOU MEAN HILLARY CLINTON. YOU BELIEVE JAMES COMEY'S ACTIONS TOWARD THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN LITERALLY UNMADE HER OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU BELIEVE HE LIED. HOW SO? WELL, THIS IS WHERE AGAIN, DAVID AND I MAY ACTUALLY AGREE ON SOMETHING. COMEY LIED WHEN HE SAID HE WAS OBLIGATED TO SHOW THE CONGRESS THAT HE WAS INVESTIGATING THE E-MAILS BECAUSE OF WHAT HE TESTIFIED TO. WHEN ALL HE ACTUALLY SAID AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS IS ALL HE SAID IS I WILL LOOK AT. WHEN HE FINALLY LOOKED AT SIX DAYS LATER AS WE ALL KNOW AS A MATTER OF HISTORY, HE FOUND NOTHING THERE. ON NOVEMBER 6, TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION HE TOLD US THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. I ALSO AGREE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED. BUT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, BECAUSE HE VIOLATED JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FUNDAMENTAL RULES. I DON'T AGREE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REASON FOR FIRING BUT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED. Martha: ALL RIGHT. JUST TO BE CLEAR, AT THIS POINT YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP? NOT WITHOUT AN INVESTIGATION. I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE FACTS ARE AFTER A THUR REINVESTIGATION THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. I'D LIKE IT TO BE BIPARTISAN JUDGMENT RATHER THAN PARTISAN ONE WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED TO BILL CLINTON IN 1998. THAT IS WHY WE NEED REPUBLICANS TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THERE WON'T BE IMPEACHMENT. THE DEMOCRAT HAVE NO POLICY POSITION, NO AGENDA OTHER THAN TO IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT, TO END HIS REMARKABLE AGENDA AND HIS SUCCESSES. Martha: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
