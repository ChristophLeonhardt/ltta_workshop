migration policy in Germany is firmly in focus right now but what to do when it's been decided that a person doesn't have the right to be here and should be deported well at the bizarre end of the spectrum is the case of one man in Frankfurt who the city's Office of Public Order confirmed to RT is had a whopping 542 Criminal Investigations against him the man who doesn't have a passport can't be deported because the authorities can't prove which nation he originally comes from oh and by the way this has been going on since 1998 over the last twenty years most of his offenses have involved drug charges driving offenses driving without a license and violations of the residency Act but who he is remains a mystery we have a loose biography that suggests that he was born in 1959 in North Africa in the past he said that he was from Morocco and also for he's from Algeria it could be that he is from one of those two countries or he could be from somewhere entirely different opposition figures say that this case shows the flaws in the current system in Germany well I'm not surprised this is the most extraordinary case the most ridiculous case so to speak well it's a failure of this system it's a failure of a government I think if the government really wanted to extradite people they could do it but they don't dare to do it because they're afraid of left-wing media they would protest and there are NGOs and so-called human rights organizations their protest against and they even try to prevent physically the extradition of people the most recent statistics for this year show that more than half of deportation orders weren't carried out the most common reason for this is that when authorities turn up at the door address where somebody was supposed to live they're not there and they can't be found however this year we've seen a sharp rise in the number of people who've avoided deportation after they physically resisted repatriation of people that don't have the right to be here in Germany is on the list for Angela Merkel as the Chancellor makes her current tour around Africa we have a situation now where not all problems have been solved as special interpretations are still a big problem but what the Chancellor has left behind are violent scenes in the city of chemnitz this is after a 35 year old German man was stabbed to death last weekend police have a Syrian and an Iraqi man in custody in connection with the killing and that has sparked angry reaction and pitched left against right over who has the right to stay in Germany Peter Oliver Artie Berlin you
