so beau let's start with Facebook you made waves recently where you came out and basically said look Twitter and Facebook everyone's excited about them millions and millions of users but they're always going to be crappy businesses talk about why well I think people should be excited about them because there are fantastic products and I made the point that the world is a better place with those two products but I think as businesses they're they're difficult and i saw this back when we had tripod you know whenever you have a communications platform where you have people communicating with one another it's difficult to monetize you know people aren't in a commercial mindset when they're talking to one another and and so I think you know the Facebook story of a hundred million dollars a month of revenue I mean maybe they have that but they have 500 million users if you have 500 million users and all you have is 100 million a month in revenue I mean where do you go from there you know and so the bull story would be Facebook like Google spent the first however many years just building up the user base and the product then they said okay it's time to monetize let's start to fill it in so Google went from a huge search engine with no revenue to suddenly this absolute monster and people think it's the same thing with Facebook is that they're just starting to monetize it yeah I do I think it's similar and and they're on similar paths and but the fact is that the Google inventory is worth a lot more you know it's a static page basically that when you do a search you know you get a page that doesn't change its somebody looking for information there in a mode of trying to find something not find people typically and the inventory is proven to be worth you know eight nine ten dollars per thousand pages where as on Facebook you know they're doing the same thing lots of users and now they're starting to monetize but the beginning of their monetization is starting at such a lower rate than Google's did when it started you know their average you know II CPMs are in the in the sense so I I just you know similar stories which I agree with but I just don't think fundamentally the inventory is that valuable on facebook and so you say this even though they have this incredible super targeting ability where I can search through Harvard Business School graduates and find the 15 we're in Cambridge and just advertised them yeah like I said you know if if if those people were looking for information about your product then that would be a good venue to advertise to them but they're not they're having conversations with other Harvard Business School graduates or their family or and just lobbing in ads at them you can do it and it's fine but it just produces very low response rates which that's what we know advertising on the internets about that's always been the promise and the low response rate mean low margins and then how about other models like payment everyone is incredibly excited about yeah virtual goods you know payments and I think all of its possible you know but it just it feels to me like it's all very nascent and I'm not saying facebook isn't an interesting and valuable business but the 25 billion dollar valuation that's been placed on and in the in the private markets I mean have we seen this movie before all of these businesses are getting these huge valuations before anybody really understands what the economics and margin characteristics of the businesses are and I would say if you if you look at the current revenue picture it doesn't look that good from a margin perspective facebook has some value the question is how much value and I think the markets once again are way ahead of themselves in any sense of what you think that value should be I think if look if they're doing a hundred million dollars a month you know 14 20 billion yeah you don't know what the margins are but you know maybe it's worth four or five billion dollars you know a four or five times revenue is a reasonable multiple that you know some of the better digital media companies are getting I think you know four or five maybe six billion dollars as a reasonable value if they're doing 100 million a month in revenue that they claim to be doing and so last question quickly thoughts on twitter which is finally just rolled out I I think Twitter I love Twitter I mean it's a fantastic news aggregation service it's a great way to keep in touch with people again I just think it's it's short you know communications between people you know I don't think that's a very good place for advertising I think that's will be proven out you know when they start adding ads as they've announced that they will I think what they'll find is that sure some people will click on the adds but I think the the overall you know II CPMs will be low and that means they're just going to have to get to the place where you know we'll 500 million people use Twitter maybe but even if it follows the same trajectory as Facebook and I don't think it will because it's not as rich a service in terms of its communications platform you know I still think that the market is ahead of itself in terms of what it's worth and the thing that worries me about this is these are such valuable things you know I mean the real I watched the first generation of these social networking services like tripod and Geocities go away because the market got way ahead of itself the companies that acquired those companies couldn't turn the reality of the business into what they had paid for them and they shut them down and that's too bad i would hate to see something like Facebook or Twitter go that direction because the world does need these things you know much more so than they need the content companies that I invest in you know but I think they're sort of political and social value is actually greater than their economic value
