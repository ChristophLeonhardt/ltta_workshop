00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,148
LIBERALS" WHICH I SHAMELESSLY

2
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:07,517
TRY TO ADVANCE ON THIS SHOW.

3
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:12,422
JOINING ME NOW IN A "JUSTICE"

4
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:15,492
EXPLOSIVE, WE HAVE A LOT TO GET

5
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:17,494
TO, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN HOUSE

6
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:19,629

NUNES.

8
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:22,632
IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE

9
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:23,600
IN NEW YORK.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,802
I WANT TO GO TO WHAT THE

11
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:26,703
PRESIDENT WAS SAYING.

12
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:28,705
HE HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE

13
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:31,975
LETTER THAT WAS LEAKED ON

14
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:32,342
DR. FORD.

15
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,077
ONE FEINSTEIN HAD.

16
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,513
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FOR A

17
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:37,181
SECOND.

18
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:39,316
PRESIDENT TRUMP: REMEMBER DIANNE

19
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:39,917
FEINSTEIN.

20
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:46,123
DID YOU LEAK?

21
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:49,026
[CROWD BOOS]

22
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:50,828
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WEB HER ANSWER?

23
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:53,664
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENT?

24
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:55,966
UH, UH, WHAT?

25
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:59,169
NO, UH, NO, I DIDN'T LEAK --

26
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:02,406
WELL, WAIT ONE MINUTE.

27
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:08,412
OH, OH, NO, WE DIDN'T LEAK.

28
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,581
JUDGE JEANINE: YOUR TAKE ON

29
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:10,881
THAT.

30
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,149
>> WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS THE

31
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:13,717
COLLAPSE OF INSTITUTIONS IN THIS

32
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:14,718
COUNTRY.

33
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:17,120
IT'S REALLY CONCERNING.

34
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,689
WHEN YOU TAKE A SUPREME COURT

35
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,257
JUSTICE AND YOU HAVE SENATORS

36
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:22,326
TALKING ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL

37
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:24,529
YEARBOOKS, YOU ARE WATCHING THE

38
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:25,730
COLLAPSE OF THE SENATE.

39
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,298
COLLAPSE OF THE REPUBLIC.

40
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:29,901
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS.

41
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:31,569
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT ABOUT

42
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,506
FEINSTEIN AND HER ROLE.

43
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:37,542
ALL THIS STUFF IS SUPPOSE TO BE

44
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:38,076
HANDLED.

45
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:39,944
SHE QUESTIONED HIM.

46
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:42,847
THE SENATE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

47
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:44,515
>> SHE HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO

48
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,084
SHARE THAT WITH REPUBLICANS.

49
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,752
AND SECOND SHE SHOULD HAVE MADE

50
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:49,220
SURE THAT THE FBI KNEW ABOUT

51
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,090
THAT IF THEY WERE DOING AN

52
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,391
ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK.

53
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,293
JUDGE JEANINE: IS THERE A

54
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:57,595
KICKBACK FOR HER, A POLITICAL

55
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,031
KICKBACK BEFORE SHE RELEASES IT

56
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:03,134
TO CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, THE SENATE

57
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,470
JUDICIARY, SHE GETS A LAWYER FOR

58
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,705
THE WOMAN.

59
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:11,075
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAID IT BEST.

60
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:14,245
HE AMERICAN SHOULD LOOK AT HIS

61
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:15,046
TESTIMONY.

62
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:17,682
HIS TESTIMONY WAS AMAZING.

63
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:19,383
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD WATCH IT.

64
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:21,419
HE TALKED ABOUT THE SCHEME THAT

65
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:23,654
THEY ALL HAD WORKING TOGETHER.

66
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:25,656
IT WAS CLEAR YOU HAD OUTSIDE

67
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:27,825
GROUPS FUNDING AN ATTACK ON HIM.

68
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,994
AND THEY KNEW MANY OUTSIDE

69
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:31,896
GROUPS KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO

70
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:33,331
DROP THIS BOMB BECAUSE IT WAS

71
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:37,735
THEIR LAST-SECOND CHANCE TO STOP

72
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,036
KAVANAUGH FROM BECOMING A

73
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,204
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

74
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:42,006
IF THAT HAPPENS AND YOU HAVE GOT

75
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:44,575
ALL KIND OF ACCUSATIONS AND

76
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:46,110
GONLD KNOWS WHAT WILL COME OUT

77
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,945
IN THE NEXT WEEK HERE.

78
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:49,814
JUDGE JEANINE: THE INSISTENCE

79
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:52,316
THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATE.

80
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:54,919
IF THE FIRST SIX FBI

81
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,587
INVESTIGATIONS DIDN'T INDICATE

82
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,022
ANYTHING, HOW IS THIS ONE GOING

83
00:02:58,022 --> 00:02:59,590
TO BE A BETTER ONE?

84
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,492
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE

85
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:02,393
FBI WOULD START.

86
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:05,363
SHE GAVE HER TESTIMONY, SO I

87
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:06,564
DOUBT THERE IS ANY MORE THAN

88
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:07,165
THAT.

89
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:09,433
ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE SWORN WHICH

90
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,470
WOULD BE A CRIME.

91
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,305
SO YOU HAVE NO WITNESSES, YOU

92
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:15,940
DON'T KNOW THE LOCATION.

93
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,608
HOW DO YOU EVEN START TO

94
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:19,677
INVESTIGATE THIS.

95
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,979
JUDGE JEANINE: SHE HASN'T ASKED

96
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,248
THE MARYLAND POLICE FOR WHICH

97
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:26,351
THERE IS NO A CUTE OF

98
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,919
LIMITATIONS, TO INVESTIGATE IT.

99
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,754
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

100
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:32,090
>> HOW WILL THE POLICE

101
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,424
INVESTIGATE IT?

102
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,026
NO ONE CAN INVESTIGATE THIS.

103
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:36,594
JUDGE JEANINE: SHE DOESN'T WANT

104
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:37,695
IT VERSUS QUITED.

105
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,497
>> SUPPOSEDLY SHE DIDN'T WANT

106
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,133
HER NAME OUT IN THE PUBLIC.

107
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,536
THERE IS A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE

108
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:46,738
COORDINATING THIS EFFORT INSIDE

109
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,172
THE SENATE WITH THE DEMOCRATS

110
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:50,575
AND ON THE OUTSIDE WITH THE LEFT

111
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,343
WING GROUPS WITH THE MEDIA

112
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:53,145
TRAILING BEHIND.

113
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,748
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT'S GOING TO

114
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:59,251
HAPPEN WITH HEIDI HEIGHT CAM AND

115
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,719
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS?

116
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,156
>> I BELIEVE THE SENATORS IN

117
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,358
THE RED STATES, IF THEY DON'T

118
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:09,328
VOTE TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH, I

119
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:10,763
THINK THEY WILL BE IN TROUBLE

120
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,297
FROM THIS ELECTION.

121
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:13,866
REPUBLICANS ARE HAPPY WITH THE

122
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,067
ECONOMY.

123
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,000
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE HAPPY

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,002
WITH THE ECONOMY.

125
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:19,004
BUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS

126
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:22,141
FINALLY REPUBLICANS ARE WAKING

127
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,709
UP -- EVERYBODY THOUGHT THIS WAS

128
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,278
A JOKE.

129
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:27,746
BUT THEY ARE STARTING TO SEE NOW

130
00:04:27,746 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION JUDGE
