don't want it to be a bloody but dead
dog
as I'm not sorry I'm not making fun all
right but seriously uh I don't know it's

curve hang on next episode

excited
square enix presents the life is strange
episode e-40 I think this is for right
so there's only two more episodes left 4
& 5 I'm not sure if I'm going to do all
of this in one episode because
apparently the last two episodes are
really long
is that a dead whale yeah apparently
some dead whales were coming up on shore
is the apocalypse the apocalypse is
coming
shit what do you do with those whales
they just left them the apocalypse is
coming guys
and only one person could save the day
max Caulfield
Morgaine I think that's a name episode
for dog food remember when they said uh
Rachel in the dark blue Rachel in the
dark room what could that mean oh that's
so sad that's so sad I don't want that
to happen
don't tell me that's gonna be enough
rest of the game I don't like that I did
I got attached to Chloe's weird hanging
out with you again
oh I'm glad we are though it was nice
that you sent me actual letters it's
more than any of my other friends of
them oh and you even wrote on that cool
parchment paper so max so pretentious
I love writing on it like English poet
all should be you deserve the best
stationery oh we're sorry over he goes
right and to visit me I don't mean that
in a way not totally
you probably wanted to avoid awkward
conversations like this
oh uh pretty much yeah look the worst
thing you can do is treat me like a baby
oh shit I still want to laugh and talk
shit with my best friend
Oh be honest we've changed and people
seriously the best view of the sunset
what if photographers call that
so-called an hour the golden ollie the
golden shout here I have no clue but you
could take some amazing shots
oh those beached whales are so sad
I know right I don't know how to feel oh
I kind of know they've released I'm
alive here with you oh shit that's so
sad
something sad you stupid god you're not
a survivor Chloe shit I know you have to
deal with so much I don't want anybody
else feeling sorry for me I do I can do
that
Oh along with my parents oh my dad still
feels guilty about lying in that car
buying you that car oh my god so she
didn't get in the accident that day for
a 16th birthday party
she got a car and I don't know let's
talk with accident I don't actually
don't know I'm just guessing are you
okay to talk about the accident
we never actually have huh oh no oh I
don't know then there's not much to say
some prick in an SUV cut me off and I
flew into a ditch shit
remember everything I saw everything in
bullet time we put my back snap oh
and that was the last thing I ever felt
in my body oh that's so sad
when I woke up in the hospital I
literally couldn't move a muscle wall
but degas good I I don't know what to
say I don't know what to say see
anything I'm just happy I did get to see
you again
oh I could have ended up vanishing out
of the blue like that girl from
Blackwell what girl what girl from
Blackwell you mean Rachel - Rachel still
disappeared oh my god you know what that
means guys that means Rachel and Chloe
wouldn't become friends that means
Rachel probably not in LA like living
her life she's probably actually been
kidnapped
Rachel you mean Rachel amber when was
the last time you talked to her uh never
I just read about her in the news I
didn't even know her name you did this
is such a different world than when we
were kids isn't it hot dogs no an
eclipse it's more like the end of the
world snow in Eclipse damn so like
everything still happened so shady I'm
trying to make light of the situation um
you think do you think so I haven't kept
up with the details all I have more time
on my hands than you plus I'm a science
nerd she's asides nug none of this makes
sense
nothing you seem out of control but
as long as we're together oh I don't
feel it's gonna angry now hanging out
with you makes me feel like a total kid

best friend

pretty high-tech lair feels like a high
tech cell oh but I am lucky my parents
bust their ass to take care of me oh I

grateful you are here with them she
right
especially when they can't even take a
walk alone sometimes I act like a total
teenage brat just to give them an excuse
to yell at me all she pathetic oh I know
Chloe you're a great daughter you're
kind and sensitive when you don't even
have to be trust me I still get my rage
on Oh

you're just trying to help what would
you do in that situation I'm a bad habit
of you know you sound like an adult now
seems like we were kids in another life
shitty but what would you do like if you
couldn't could only use move your head
what would you do - no it's kind of
scary to even think about do you think
you could make youtube videos I mean you
can edit them but you could record them
right I don't know it's kind scary
should I try me okay anyway um seems
like yesterday to me it seems like
yesterday we were little brats here

tend hit you're such a geek
yeah that's why I love you of course I

putting off the inevitable while my
parents suffer along and I will - is she
gonna ask me - this isn't how I want
things to end what what do you see she

I can't do it oh my god actually making
me do it
shit that's so that's so difficult I'm
like like usually I would say yeah okay
because I'm a sore person but because
we've sort of sort of attached with
Chloe so much like it's hard for me just
to say yes but uh I don't know like in
in 90% of situations I would probably do
it so uh
ah this is such a big decision though

appreciate it they didn't spend like a
half an hour doing all that shit trying

Chloe and Max have and how important it
is but yeah it looks like I'm back yes

to find out how she's doing
oh yeah cakes in the hospital I've been
wondering what the hell happened to Kate
okay cuz we saved up and then there was
like the story was like okay well you
saved okay that's it it's all it makes
me think was there a point in saving up
because it's sort of like what's the
difference but this is the first time
it's the first time whereas he has
always freaked me out like dude I hear
you but imagine how Kate feels I'm so
glad I get to see her again

weird do you think that would have been
a funeral scene who wouldn't be this be
it I'm a little nervous just all go in
there and be your friend I'll wait out
here so you can chill by yourselves I
was a total dick for blowing a fuse when
you answered Kate's call the other day

to the roof to talk me down Oh max I
felt so lost and alone she feels happy
when I saw how much you cared how hard
you were trying Oh make me realize I
wasn't alone you hate there are so many
people who love you and want to help you
I know you should see all the letters
and postcards oh I lost the flowers to
other patients here because they need
them more than me Oh I'm keeping the
balloons though one of the nurses gave
me some pen and paper so I could do some
drawings oh I love your illustration
she's happy God not kind of dark there
for a while but I have an idea for a new
children's book about bullying oh okay I
was thinking of having some photographs
in there too I hope that's a subtle hint
that you'll let me take the photographs
for the
was that subtle yeah you better take the
pictures max I'm going to be here for
another day until my family comes out to
visit how are they treating you like
they need to protect me forever

guilty even though they didn't do
anything I'm surprised how many students
from Blackwell wrote me Daniel mr.
Jefferson even Victoria wrote me a very
sweet note and I believe she was being
