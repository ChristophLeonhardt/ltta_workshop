hi my name's Robin Drake I'm United States Naval Academy graduate former Marine Corps officer FBI agent and former head of a behavioral analysis program for federal government so you want to get promoted and you want to you know if you want to use the words convince management that you're the guy for the job or woman for the job the first question I ask myself all the time is is I I never think in terms of convincing anyone of anything I think in terms of inspiring them so if I if I want to get a promotion I want to get a raise or any of these things the first thing I ask myself is how can I inspire them to want to so if you want to move into a position of leadership you want to move up in a company first thing ask yourself is how can I inspire them to want me and the first way you can inspire anyone to take action and want you to do anything is you've got to understand how what's important to them how do they see prosperity what can you do to make their job easier and how can you do it so it's in terms of them and what's important to them someone once asked me you know what do you think about the 30 second elevator pitch I said 30 second elevator pitch is fine as long as you're talking and offering your skills in terms of what's important to them otherwise completely wasted words so anytime I'm put in for position or anyone's put in position demonstrate your skills put all those things down there those ego gratifying moments but don't do it for self-serving reasons do it so you can demonstrate how these skills and attributes you have are going to be there for them to be a resource for your bosses to be successful and for the company be successful so it's no problem touting your own skills and abilities and demonstrating that but only if it's in terms of the priorities of others
