1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,890
in the fantasy world of Game of Thrones
fire-breathing dragons are the ultimate

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:16,570
weapon of war behind the scenes it took
an army to create them in the world they

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,670
inhabit we had a meeting with HBO and
they were talking about how the how

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,179
important the Dragons will be for the
coming seasons and how much the

5
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:31,480
character personality will be a major
part of the of the story picks armando

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,329
joined Game of Thrones in season 227
visual effects companies the show is

7
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:44,890
hired to date their job to create
dragons that were coming of age if this

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,050
animal is getting bigger than the
balance the muscle structure the way it

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,180
actually lifts up in the air is changing
is becoming more complicated than if you

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,800
have something tiny that it's a hop a
few feet and this was an incredibly

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,989
challenging thing to develop to do so he
says the artists had to take something

12
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,860
familiar the went to a supermarket and
dissected chicken to learn how the

13
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,040
muscle structure should be you know when
the dragon comes in and they like shoot

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,630
and the ice starts to like break up it's
work like this which has made Game of

15
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,740
Thrones a must across for the next
generation I want to work on characters

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,990
so just seeing dragons when the little
baby is trying to shoot tiny bits of

17
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,830
fire to what they are now it just he's
huge beasts and then resonates well with

18
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,150
everyone I think for these final year
visual arts students it was part of the

19
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,380
inspiration for their thesis film he
learnt anything from watching Game of

20
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,560
Thrones yeah I think so um definitely
that not everything has to be CG so like

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,210
the Wolves they were real wolves at that
like green screened in that wasn't CG

22
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,960
and to me that was really eye-opening in
a way I think the original intent was to

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,979
write a story that was so grand that it
was completely unbound by the

24
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,710
constraints of regular production and
visual effects has made

25
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,190
a show like Game of Thrones possible
because the facts is not the driving

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,080
force of the show I think it's the drama
that is built around people's

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,460
relationships it's not trying to be a
fantasy story this could be true this

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,920
could be a real thing and I think that's
what makes the magic of it a magic that

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:00:00,000
has taken TV drama an epic scale
