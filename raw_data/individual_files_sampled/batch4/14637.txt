Amba Ruud has just resigned from her position as Home Secretary and it's largely to do with that whole windra scandal but it's also connected to the expose a of her deportation targets and now the new Home Secretary has been announced it's Sajid Javid but who is he and what exactly does he stand for in my column today I'm writing about the circumstances that brought about rods resignation but for now I just want to talk about Sajid Javid he's an interesting one he's a politician that's got me quite conflicted actually Sajid Javid is from a Pakistani Muslim family in Lancashire but he's previously said that he practices no religion it was during a Hosting's debate in 2010 he was asked if he had a personal faith and he responded with my own family's heritage is Muslim myself and my four brothers were brought up to believe in God but I do not practice any religion my wife is a practicing Christian and the only religion practiced in my house is Christianity now I've seen some reports that say he's the UK's first Muslim Home Secretary I don't think that's an entirely fair assessment and in that same Hosting's he said that Christianity is the religion of our country great but then again he lied about receiving anti-muslim abuse he's part of the perpetually offended brigade and he's one of the people that actually thought punish a Muslim day was real or at least he wanted the electorate to think that it was he claimed that he received a punish a Muslim day latter but it was exposed that he just cropped the image from one that was allegedly sent to another family and published that instead who knows if he received anything and who knows who these things even came from him I mean punish a Muslim day who even thinks of something like that and isn't it funny that when the day actually came around nobody was punished but Javid of course condemned Donald Trump as well for when he did the Britain first tweets for endorsing what he called a vile hateful door organisation that hates me he didn't say anything about the legitimacy of the content of the tweets and then he claims that the housing crisis isn't caused by immigration what and then he admits that labour deliberately opened the doors to more than four million immigrants in 13 years and except that at least it does have some effect on wages so flip flop flip flop and then he complains about old people blocking new developments in their hometowns which they don't want destroyed with concrete park because of more immigrants and who can blame them and then on the the grooming gang issue he supported Serra champion and called for an honest debate on child sexual exploitation is he confused or what or is he trying to appear balanced and not alienate Muslims who he thinks might reform I'm not sure but him sitting on the fence like this isn't doing him any favors it's doing God's no favors either I can't work him out some say that he's a careerist he knows that championing some populist ideas were probably winning some points with the public others would say that he's a Muslim practicing to care I don't think he is I really don't think there's much of a conspiracy here if I'm honest in my opinion Sajid might be just another useful idiot he says the right things sometimes but deep down he's really not against the fundamental changes happening to Britain is he he might call for an honest discussion about child sexual exploitation but do you think for a moment that he's willing to accept that his own community has a major problem with this issue and that many from within his community will need to be deported as a result even if he is and he's dakar he'd know the fallout if he were to embrace that publicly now I'm not convinced that Javid would ever follow through with policies that will be required to address the problems we talked about in an honest debate and so while I don't think Javid is gonna do any good for this country I don't think he's actually gonna do much worse than Rudd either I'll say this at least it isn't Diane Abbott yet if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and like and subscribe you
