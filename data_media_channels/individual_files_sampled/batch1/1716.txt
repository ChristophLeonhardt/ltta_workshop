I am so me okay and I'm Molly could be Lila and you're in the stream today who can solve Cameroon's and the phone crisis we will look at its impact and ask whether an upcoming election could change the situation Cameroonians online have been pitching this topic to us almost daily so you too can join this conversation today live on youtube or via Twitter in Cameroon violence between Anglophone separatists and government forces has killed at least 400 people this year and more unrest is expected ahead of the country's October 7 presidential election English speaking separatists are attempting to prevent Sunday's vote from taking place in the country's Northwest and southwest regions and Lafon residents there say they have long suffered marginalization by Cameroon's francophone majority protests by teachers and lawyers starting in 2016 helped prompt renewed calls for the establishment of an independent state of Amazonia for Anglophone residents demonstrations have grown into armed conflict while tens of thousands are now internally displaced or have fled to neighboring countries online Cameroonians are sharing news and often gruesome images using the hashtags Amazonia and free southern cameroon's so with us to talk about all of these issues Edward gang is an organizer with the Amazonia peoples restoration movement in Douala Cameroon Kewalo president of the Opposition Cameroon People's Party and in 2011 she was the first woman to run for president in Cameroon and in Abuja Nigeria al Jazeera reporter I made it heurists who's been following this story now before we start I have to say that we did actually set up the minister of information for Cameroon to be on the program he agreed to be on the program we were in a back and forth on the telephone and then he stopped responding to us so we do not have a government voice in this conversation unless you want to drum jump on Twitter at AJ stream cameraman government you're very welcome to be part of this conversation we'd love you to be Malika the people that are jumping on Twitter to direct their thoughts to this dream are people like yung blaze he is a freelance journalist based in Cameroon and he talks to us about the atmosphere there right now it's been two years since the conflict began here in Anglophone Cameroon and I think this year is very significant because the amount of destruction the amount of villages properties have been burned down destroyed both by the military at the padishah is alarming and the people in Anglophone Cameroon are living in fear the streets are deserted we've seen in the past weeks ours people have fled to other parts of Cameroon and the French parts of camera we also know there is a large number of Korean refugees in Nigeria we have other people staying in bushes here in Cameroon the streets are full of fear when you walk through the streets of Amanda Booya Kumba and all the paths of echo from Cameroon you've the sense that there is fear everywhere with fear everywhere describing the tense atmosphere there how do you have an election campaign well I think the ba government is one of the few governments in the world who would organize an election in these circumstances and that's one of the reasons that our party the Cameroon People's Party has taken the decision not to run in this election because you have just mentioned the situation is is horrific we have close to a thousand people dead we have at this moment at least 300,000 displaced from the northwest and southwest at least because people are right now leaving in droves out of fear for the election violence so we are effectively having an election without the participation of 20% of the country and for those of us who still believe in one Cameroon who still believe that we need to get rid of the beyond government that's clear we have to get rid of this government it is oppressive it is violent but we as Cameroonians can and should live together we the tendency of saying sometimes that the government is the number-one secessionists because you cannot have part of your population so upset that they want to leave the country and your answer is to behave as if nothing is going on and to kind of go on about your business as usual this is a good point because I I described Edwin as we were getting ready for the show as Cameroonian are you Cameroonian no I am an imbecile yeah I have never been a Cameroonian because the arrangement in which these two very distinctive people came to be hasn't been completed let's start remembering that you cannot see in this part of the world english-speaking people who now called answer from Bosnian and french-speaking people who a call Cameroonians being forced into a union that should never have been do you know that the the plebiscite which was supposed to bring this to desperate people has not been fully completed so I'm very happy that we are having a member of Cameroon civil society Madame calledit Cala and a political party member to engage in the final solution the final and permanent solution will be one that will have to address how these two countries come to become together this is the way to solve this problem until we get back to getting to the root of the problem you usually wind the clock back and say French people were over here french-speaking people over here English people people were over here and now we're done that's what you want and he's asking for you know another reference as a precedent to provide why you cannot win back that floor while I totally understand and wins point and he has you know a historical point the reality of our day-to-day living for the 50 for the last 58 years is that Cameroonians from the Northwest and Southwest regions are married to Campion's in the in the other eight regions people own property across these regions he who is speaking he says he's an amazonian but at the time I don't know what nationality he has today but when he left Cameroon he carried a Cameroonian passport he carried a communion I don't prefer of convenience madam you know that of convenience today in a situation where we have had catastrophic governance we are here to find a solution you should not be participating in a process that is the cause of this problem I would like to draw attention to what is happening in Canada please remember that we are we have presidents the Canada Mother we have a model to apply meantime just take a pause for a moment meantime let me just bring you in here we have this election that's coming up on Sunday and there are repercussions from the violence because we have these two warring sections we have an administration and then people who want to be separate from the administration in conflict with each other what kind of election is it going to be you know basically Cara was talking about their party not participating in the election and that has been the bane of opposition all over Africa and in most developing countries the the question people asked me when I visited crossover state last month I was exchanging some ideas of abuse with what some of the refugees and I was asked from one of them are you willing to go back to Cameroon ahead of the elections is that going to what and I said going to vote he said nobody would be will be voting in that part of the country I said why he said first of all there is threat of violence of both sides and then the issue is we want a solution a political solution to this situation we are ignored by the international community and the Opposition in Cameroon is not a united in its quest to resolve this and the separatists are actually demanding that things should walk their own way now the problem here is from the way I say it the way it is now the opposition is not United to have a common approach to deal with Paul B as president of Cameroon and then you have this disunity also on the side of people who want to support state and how much attention has been paid to the struggle for Amazonia by the international community you will say not much attention is being paid to even the refugees we met while actually not properly looked after so it's a very very delicate situation but the biggest problem is will the election be allowed to continue in the Anglophone region for me the question is the possibility of that election holding easily in that part of the country is actually very very slim simply because the Amazonas approach is one that they would they will not allow an access to all there and nobody is sure whether the Cameroon forces will also allow anybody to have any form of activity in that part of Cameroon we the refugees are telling us that they've been chased away and that we ask not to go back to certain villages anybody found there will be considered as a terrorist I think what you're saying I mean it's echoed here online this is niba who says it is not safe for any presidential candidate to campaign outdoors in Amazonia because anyone could be hit by a stray bullet if not they could be targeted as a traitor or working for the government of Cameroon so it doesn't feel safe to campaign anywhere around Amazonia but to highlight what this disunity that you mentioned looks like because we're seeing it online as well I also wanted to share this tweet this is from any-any who says we are faced with two evils here president via and you the separatists he's talking to people online we choose the lesser evil which is BIA you will try but you will never divide this country believe that so Edwin of course I'm going to give this one to you this person and there are a few others on the chain believe that the lesser of two evils is the president who has been there for seven this this is what happened in a totalitarian society where they have lived with just two presidents since 1960 what does vert know in Cameroon it is a selection process what is happening is that they grew up thinking that they can impose their will on their english-speaking people but the error of doing that is over completely over what you talk two knives you're dealing with someone like me who is reasonable who knows that there is a constitutional way of finding a permanent solution and I like to draw your attention to the latest mechanism for bringing that permanent solution we have the Green Tree Accord in which Cameroon and Nigeria we're signatories and in that Accord you also have the United States you have Germany you have France and the United Kingdom these are all under now international obligation to participate in the solution so when you hear all this call for dialogue it should be one that is associated with the word permanent solution with the instrument given to that being the constitution in which we were supposed to have implemented which was not implemented if that is brought into play we will have clearly the solutions out there you remember that in camera we have to acknowledge the the person online who is talking about the lesser evil being a BIA I think we have only gotten to that situation because the Amazonian movement decided to take up arms I think it's very important for us to be honest amongst english-speaking Cameroonians you have those who support a unitary state who want to they acknowledge that some rights they their rights are not respected and so on but they want to stay with Cameroon exactly as it is today you have many many who believe in some form of autonomy for the different states in Cameroon that is a federal state different types of members that our proposal comments I would want to say something to you go ahead on it somebody will ask me in one of the refugee camps asked me do you think that Paul gear will allow some form of autonomy to the weight according to the Anglophone region of Cameroon and the question that is bugging their mind is that this is not going to happen going by the presidents of Paul be upon me over the years they totally agree with you I totally agree with you and made that it's not going to happen bye-bye Paul Biya I was giving I I want to just mention the three different groups referring to Cameroon as a source of the solution we cannot ask the funds to gut the chicken house please let me finish the first thing is that you have to acknowledge and respect that those three political opinions exists amongst english-speaking Cameroonians true is that our common enemy is B and this is the mistake that the Amazonians have made none of us none of those three groups is going to find any solution as long as mr. beer is in power and the fact that the Amazonians decided to take up arms has complicated the situation further because the population which is suffering today people who are being killed well let me just pick up in that pause very helpful pause Edwin said you cannot ask the Fox to guard the chickens but in the meantime there are lots of people on the ground who are suffering and honored you met some of those people I know that you've been reporting in the region in just the last couple of days let me share just a little bit of some of your reporting you can have a look at it here on my laptop looking at some of the refugees coming out of this crisis six children join other refugees to move to a new settlement away from the nigeria cameroon border this is the family's third relocation since they fled the fighting in southern Cameroon none of the children has been to school since then we don't have peace in the house because their children worry worry us mommy daddy what are we doing here we are not going through school what are we doing here let's go back with no money and hope of returning to their former home anytime soon she says their futures even parents who could afford to hire private tutors for their children are giving up well my dad we saved that country for stepping down you you managed to sell them to school now the savings is gone so you're seeing the the impact of the these warring factions on the ground in terms of refugees and what were they telling you how what kind of state were they in scary stories we've met the first trip I am I met to cross river state we went to overdo there we saw pregnant woman who who pregnancy who's pregnant was aborted fighting for her life she told me that she spent eight days in the bush and eventually when she crossed over into Nigeria she lost her baby and it was traumatic we met somebody a woman another woman who lost her mind simply because of the trauma she went through she talked about the relations are talking about how the security forces combed the village killed a lot of people including husband children uncle and some neighbors so she ran and destroy is actually very very pathetic and these are people who would move to several locations inside Nigeria thank God for them what they tell me is the work goes to communities that really share the same language same culture and they took them in it was a difficult moment for them at the start when they arrived Nigeria simply because there were no initial arrangements to receive that number of refugees into Nigeria so before the international community and the NGO stepped in a lot of people suffered so the suffering continues and I think and that was the point that I was trying to make is that the the BIA is a dictator he is violent and he is primarily responsible for the violence in this situation I will and there's no question about that but the choice of the Amazonians to also start using violence has ended up being the worst thing that could happen to the people that they claim to be fighting for because they have created a situation of complete chaos in the northwest and Southwest regions they have created a situation where the population if you keep insisting on demands and accessing the violence that is patently unfair is not right the opposition has not being able to replace gear for the last 40 years that's the process of achieving decision but it is predicated on what's going back to where this problems that you have going on the source of the problem and that no doubt you'd only have an octogenarian president being selected on the seventh to run for the seventh term do you think that the Opposition in Cameroon has any solution they don't have any solution for the last 70 years and constable - I'm calling time I'm just calling timeout for now if you're watching this we're talking about Cameroon they have elections coming up on Sunday the president there is it's going for a seventh term president pour beer and meanwhile there is a conflict going on between the president and also regions the northwest and Southwest regions of the Cameroon and believe it or not Edwyn and car are both opposition voices although it sounds like their opposition with each other Milica go ahead I want to bring in this voice via Twitter this is cow who says the government should recognize its failure to handle the crisis and call for a ceasefire make sure all the perpetrators of human rights violations are made to pay for their misdeeds and release all detainees and only after that is done will our people accept a dialogue so that is one view of how we move forward how we push on from this but there's also a video comment from someone this is Terrance who comes to us from the UK he's a member of the Southern cameroon's National Council out of the UK and here's what he says I just want to make a few clarifications about few things that the Western media and the people in the West the mistakes they make about my country when the conflict in Southern Command is open cold and angry from crisis I believe this is very wrong because one it is not a crisis it is a war where's the 4pf like a puppy to Cameroon declared war on Amazonia and therefore we cannot call it any other thing but other than a war so it's not a crisis it's a war and we am personally also value that our war of independence so how many says this isn't just a conflict this isn't just a crisis this is a war from what you've seen and the the those who are displaced in the refugees you've talked to how do people feel about that point well a lot of people still feel exactly the same way they feel that it's a war declared on them by the government of Cameroon simply because of the language barrier the culture but we have all that now the problem now is finding a solution to this problem how much international or global attention is being paid to this crisis not much to who is the main beneficiary of the crisis we we have an opposition that is filthier to kick out upon via over the past decades and we also have a group the Amazonia separatist movement that is fighting the colonial forces an organized security force which is sometimes difficult to deal with I understand their predicament earlier in the in the year then I didn't govern the rest of some of the leaders and hand it over to the Cambodian government and they're still in detention many of them are still in detention now why do they go why do they get their support so it's a difficult question the biggest beneficiary to all this is perhaps albeit because the opposition is divided incidentally because the government intervened and made it so and then you have a war which he can approach the international community to say that we have separatists in homage to declared war on the state of Cameroon even before they were recognized as an independent state now the other question is going by the similar movements in in the region the the opera movement for example we have one in Nigeria we have recently we saw what became of the Catalonia movement the the desire for independence in in the in in the in the Barcelona region of Spain which of course did not work out there very well and that you have to be offered like I said the question now is how will the Amazonia movement how strong is that Lobby International Lobby to get their voices heard and how strong is the opposition in Cameroon to withstand the pressures on the polar bear government we have the solution we've just not been given the opportunity to explain it let me say we are in the same team miss koala you remember that you've been struggling to get installed democracy one on one since 1960 we don't have two presidents they have to be a reason for that is because this country is potentially allergic to democracy as a result of what they know is a fraud that was at this outset of this creation of the country how do we resolve it we have presidents already said you remember there was how Canada treats the Quebec are the Quebec situation they ended up having the 1987 measly Accord that was based on the constitutional framework you should be open to that please you cannot have it both ways you cannot be protect then you want to install democracy 101 in Cameroon and at the same time you are conscious of the fact that freedom begets justice for everybody so that was just one of it then I want to draw your attention to another solution that was done when and car and we're actually gonna take these other solutions we're gonna take them online because we're almost out of time for this show it's never enough for a half an hour stream show to talk about Cameroon never mallika what do you have two comments on either sides one from any who says separatist should start by laying off their arms allowing schools to reopen and stop their violence on us live on YouTube we got this comment from Robert who says the opposite ambos own Ian's never took up arms until the president started killing them so they had to defend themselves and that is what they are doing and of course our govt following the cameroon elections coming up on sunday very closely you all see the odyssey the reporting ahmed idris koala thank you so much for being on the show and edward gang it's never boring with you on board thank you very much indeed take care of him thank you see your line you
