so a bunch of students tore down a Confederate monument at UNC Chapel Hill this week and the media calls these people protestors but they really are just vandals and criminals whatever you think about the Confederacy it is felony vandalism to destroy a statue like that but this is the precedent that we've set over the past few years it's a very dangerous precedent in my view where if you don't like a statue well then go ahead and just tear it down the law is gonna step to the side and allow felony destruction of property to occur without doing anything about it now that said I have no problem with this specific monument coming down per se III think this we can't lump all Confederate monuments together not all Confederate monuments are are equal this one was erected in I believe 1918 or somewhere around there and it was clear from the beginning that it was associated with white supremacy so yeah take it down now I still don't think that a school should stand by and let students do it themselves because that's a crime and is you can't have that kind of chaos and you can't allow students to just go well I don't like this and so they they take they take it down and I still don't think we can lump all Confederate monuments together I think we have to take it on a case-by-case basis and there are several problems with the precedent that we're setting here and that has been said over the last couple years when it comes to these monuments not the least of which is is how unevenly the precedent is applied there are many monuments in America that that may be reasonably considered offensive because they commemorate bad people or they commemorate people who represented bad things or both in some cases and the argument against Confederate monuments I guess is that they fought for a bad thing now which is slavery now I'm I'm um of course everyone agrees in modern America that slavery is a bad thing not everyone agrees from a historical perspective that it's necessarily exactly accurate to say that the Confederates fought primarily for slavery I'm not going to really get into that discussion it's a different discussion but the real causes of the Civil War and everything that is a multi-faceted discussion I think anyone who's done even a little bit of reading understands that it's it's it's certainly not it's at least not quite as simple as that now there are those who argue that it was straightforwardly a war over slavery others will point out that slavery was only turned into the reason for the war about midway through it was a political decision made by Lincoln when he was when he began to see that Europe may may come to the aid of the south and he saw that and that's when the Emancipation Proclamation came and Emancipation Proclamation was a political document that had no actual effect and did nothing at all except politically because it was it was written specifically to free slaves in the States that Lincoln no had no longer had any control over while allowing state while allowing states that he did control to keep their slaves so again it was just a political document and and this this idea that it was a war over slavery something happened halfway through going into the war Lincoln made it clear that he did not want to fight a war over slavery if he could keep the Union together and keep slavery he would do that he also made it clear in while he was running for president that he did not believe in equality for black and white people he did not believe that black people were equal to white people so he was a racism so now all of these things are you know these are all relevant but let's put all that to the side what I what I don't think can be denied is that several of the men who've had their monuments torn down especially Robert Ely Stonewall Jackson and some others these particular men let's just talk about Jackson and Lee for say these were men of high moral character and great personal courage who did not themselves believe that they were fighting for slavery both men opposed slavery personally as did plenty of other southerners though I think Lee's wife did own slaves which is true general Grant's wife also owned slaves you saw that on in the north as well which is another reason which is another complicating factor when you think about well where did the people and no did the people in the North the northern soldiers especially did they think that they were marching down into the south to fight against slavery and I think the answer in most cases is no and we kind of can see that the answer is no because some of their generals actually owned slaves but the point is that they you know guys like Jackson Lee they felt obliged to fight on the side of their home states you can say that they were wrong about that that they were mistaken they made the wrong choice they were blinded by loyalty to families and homes and whatever but if you paint them all as slobbering racists or if you suggest that Jackson and Lee were fighting because they really wanted to keep black people enslaved well then it's gonna be clear that you've just never read a history book because that's that's just that's just not set accurate the interesting thing is that both Lee and Jackson were admired by the north and the south during the time of the Civil War the men who marched down into Virginia to kill Confederates still had a greater respect for some of the Confederate officers than we do today which is kind of interesting I mean these were you know these guys had a much greater reason to hate those men than we do and yet they didn't hate them nearly as much and I do think when you're looking at a guy like Robert Lee you you do have to look within the context of the time this was a war hero a man that was respected as I said across the country before the Civil War the federal government comes to him and wants him to put it plots to put him in charge of the army but from Lee's perspective as a Virginia man if he does that even though he opposed secession and he was morally opposed to slavery but if he if he if he were to take this job offer from the federal government it means that he will be leading troops into his home state into his home taking up arms against his friends neighbors and even his own sons so for him it's a choice between the federal government or his family and his home and his country now what we have to understand is that back in those days especially in the south you consider when you talked about your country when a guy said my country what he meant most of the time was his state in the early days of of the United States people especially in the south identified much more with their state than they did with the country they saw the country as this collection of states but they looked at their state as their actual home in their country and what they were most loyal to we don't look at it like that now but it's kind of hard to say they were wrong for seeing it that way i I would argue that they were actually much more in the spirit of what was intended when the country was founded where it was never really intended that people would necessarily identify with the federal government homes they were tied to the land they were you know we didn't they didn't have all the tech now they'd have radios an internet and everything where they could kind of connect with everyone across the country they just had their home in their land and their farms and their families that's all they had and that's what they were loyal to and that's what guys like so someone like Robert Ely he had to make that choice between in his mind it was between his home and the federal government he chose his home and then he proceeded to fight with great brilliance and dignity always outnumbered always out manned always outgunned and yet winning battle after battle with courage and tenacity and that's why he has monuments ok the fact that the Confederacy was a slaveholding country is a very serious moral problem and yes he is stained by it inevitably but Thomas Jefferson actually owned slaves personally hundreds of them Thomas Jefferson owned hundreds of humans he owned people and yet most of us can still admire the great things that he did and honor him for those for the rete for those regions for the great things that he did even aside from the very dark evil that he was personally and directly involved in so what I'm saying is my opinion on Confederate statues is that some of them are worth keeping up some of them are not and it really just depends on the situation but I do think we need to try to develop a little bit of a more nuanced and mature and historically accurate perspective on that period in our history which I think many of us simply don't have be that as it may the argument is that all of these monuments must come down because the monuments represents slavery whether or not the individuals who actually fought for the south meant to or wanted to personally fight for slavery and many of them had no such intention but that's the art so we've established the precedent that people who are on the wrong historical side of a grave moral issue even indirectly on its side cannot have monuments that appears to be that's what we're saying when it comes to the Confederate thing but then we have to ask what about what about people who were personally morally depraved rotten and evil yet or on the right side of some issue I think we can agree or should agree that they don't deserve monuments either we would all be kind of upset if animal rights activists erected a monument to Adolf Hitler on the basis that Adolf Hitler was himself a proponent of animal rights which he was or in or environmentalism or whatever so it seems that the precedent is that only decent people who fought for decent things can have statutes here's my problem it has been open season on the indecent and offensive monuments only so long as those are monuments to 19th century white guys from the American South that to me seems way too selective if we're gonna do this thing if we're really gonna start purging the offensive monuments on the basis that I've just mentioned here then I think it had we have to we have to go we have to do it all it doesn't make sense to focus especially and only on these Confederate monuments makes no sense the Selective if we do it so selectively then the Selective nature of this purging will lead people myself included to suspect that there is a specifically left-wing ideological motivation behind this outcry against statues and it actually has very little to do with with with slavery or racism or anything if it's not ideological if our modern sensibilities simply will not tolerate statues that commemorate problematic figures of any sort then I think it doesn't make any sense that the outrage has not extended beyond Confederate soldiers you know many people in the south feel that this is an attack on their heritage and their history if it's not that if it's not an attack on their heritage in the history if it's really just a movement against evils like racism and slavery then all of the statues associated with evil should come down if these are the only ones that come down then I think people from the South that are upset about this because they feel like their heritage and history is being attacked I think they're vindicated there they have every right to be upset and their suspicions have been vindicated and confirmed if there's if there's are the only statues that come down if we're looking to be consistent then we have to go for all the offensive statues or we go for none of them and just let them all stay up I think that's kind of the way you know that's the way we have to we have to look at if we are this is not what about ISM okay this is just simply a matter of consistently applying a principle and I think a lot of the time people are I do I get accused of what about ISM other your what you know that's any anytime something is going on and you come along and you say well yeah but what about it there's not always a problem but sometimes it makes sense to say what about because what you're the the message the argument are making is okay let's extend this principle let's consistently apply the principle and when a principle is only being applied over here but not over here I think it is perfectly reasonable to come and say what about over here let's take that principle and extend it and if you don't want to extend that principle across the board well then there's something wrong with the principle and we need to reevaluate that's the point of the what about argument is what we're trying to do is we're trying to establish it if you don't want to consistently apply the principle there's something wrong with the principle we need to throw it out or we need to consistently apply it so let's sum let's go over a few other offensive monuments and statues that if we are consistently applying the principle should also come down number one there is the monument to child sex predator Harvey Milk in San Francisco now there are a few monuments to Harvey Milk in San Francisco and I think across the country there are there even streets named after him and schools and there's a naval ship named after him for some damn reason I don't know why he's got he's got his own naval ship and and he has his own postage stamps okay he this guy's all over the place I don't advocate for tearing down the schools just because they have his name or the or and I don't advocate for for demolishing the naval ship I think those can just be renamed the posters postage stamps can be burned but the monuments must come down Harvey Milk is despite what you may have heard in Hollywood this is not a civil rights hero this is not a hero of any kind all he did this is what he accomplished with his life is he was attracted to other men and he was elected to public office that was his whole achievement is his own political advancement that's what he did okay that was his one achievement but I don't I don't see how that minor political achievement outweighs the fact that Harvey Milk was a pederasty who preyed upon drug-addicted boys there's a quote from one of his friends that is is instructive because even his friends even the people that knew him don't deny this fact one of his friends said that he had a penchant for young Waifs with drug abuse problems let's be more specific about this the young Waifs were miners Runaways and drug addicts who came to milk looking for a mentor or father figure and instead they were groomed to be milks sex toys essentially at least to have two of his victims later went on to commit suicide okay this was a deeply evil man he contributed nothing of value to society he left misery and suicide in his wake he preyed upon drug addicts and Runaways and he used their helplessness and their vulnerability as a means to satisfy his own sexual desires that's that's what he was he was murdered not he he was murdered by a fellow Democrat that doesn't make him a martyr just because I'm sorry that that he was killed that doesn't change anything about this because the guys killed doesn't make him a martyr doesn't make him a hero doesn't make him a saint you're not automatically canonized just because you were killed doesn't change the fact that he was a Petrus who preyed upon you know fifteen year-old boys who were Runaways and drug addicts and were confused and lonely that's what he liked to do that's how he got his his his you know that's how he he fulfilled his sexual urges doesn't change that the fact that he was killed doesn't change he was still a deeply evil man and he does not deserve to be remembered or commemorated or honored at all not at all and in fact I don't know what the what the law was back then but according to the law as a California now if he were if he were alive today he'd be going to jail for what he did with these boys number two there is a bust of Bill Clinton in Little Rock Arkansas I think also needs to come down Bill Clinton has been credibly accused of rape assault harassment multiple times Juanita Broderick's story about Clinton is horrifying I think most of us know it by now but it's bears repeating according to her she was lured to his hotel room where he proceeded to forcibly pin her down on the bed while she pleaded with him to stop and he raped her allegedly this was forcible violent rape this was not even a you know a thing where some of the stuff you see in Hollywood were basically Clinton promised to advance her political career as she slept with him and so she did it and then she regretted it you know wasn't it wasn't that kind of thing this was pinned her down on the bed she's pleading with him to stop she's saying no no and he rapes her the kind of thing that would put most people in prison for a long time but instead Bill Clinton went to the White House and there are many other stories of abuse all of them from people who are far more credible than Clinton himself and and and almost all these stories follow the same pattern they sound very similar they're very consistent and the people that have been telling these stories about Clinton have been telling the same story for years they haven't changed it so that's what makes them credible and yet this guy has a statue in Arkansas I think it needs to come down number three there's a statue of a mass murderer Vladimir Lenin in in Seattle now this statue I believe is privately owned it's on private property I would not support destroying private property but the statue toppling mobs don't seem to mind destroying things that don't belong to them so I'm trying to figure out why they haven't gone after this one yet I'm not saying that they should as I said all these things should be done legally should be taken down legally but it's just interesting that they haven't set their sights on this yet Lenin was a was a Marxist revolutionary who founded the the the tyrannical Soviet state which would then proceed to murder in prison starve and slave tens of millions of people over the course of the 20th century hundreds of millions of people for a while on the left there was a there was a an effort and I think there still is an effort to separate Lenin from Stalin and to say well Stalin was the butcher and even though there are still some people who fact we talked about a couple weeks ago there was a poll done among Millennials and a certain not that small percentage of Millennials actually admire Stalin they think he was an admirable guy so even Stalin is but but I think among a lot of liberals there has been historically an attempt to separate Lenin from Stalin say well Stalin was the butcher and Lenin was just a fighter for Marxist ideals they were both butchers although Lenin was a a fighter for Marxist ideals and that should tell you something about Marxist ideals that he was a butcher and yet was also consistently a fighter for those ideals because they are terrible and morally depraved ideals um that was that was that was Lenin so that needs to come down number three or four to be out number number four I think there's a bust of you Genest Margaret Sanger in the National Portrait Institute now Margaret Sanger of course is the and this bust is part of their their civil rights exhibit to make it even worse part of their civil rights exhibit and then the the National Portrait Institute is run by the Smithsonian Smith Smith Smithsonian Smithsonian I can't speak anyway so it's part of their their civil rights exhibit markers saying are obviously the founder of Planned Parenthood she once proudly spoke to the KKK and it is true maybe you've seen that picture online of Margaret Sanger standing up in front of a bunch of hooded KKK members and giving a speech that photo is fake it's it's it's photoshopped not a real photo but she did actually speak to the KKK she spoke to a group of female KKK members she was a proponent of the eugenics movement and the eugenics movement was which was which was popular in the early 20th century the eugenics movement was and is all about ridding society of the undesirable classes through forced sterilization and abortion and other methods now Sanger's apologists will will will say that she was not a racist and that she she wasn't looking to specifically annihilate the black race instead she was looking to just get rid of poor people and especially people with mental disabilities regardless of the race and and that's that's true I that doesn't make her any better she's still that's not that's that's it that's a heck of a defense isn't it but I think it's interesting I've actually seen there's a certain quote from Margaret Sanger that her defenders will cite in order to defend her against racism charges and I want to read this quote to you this is her talking to a group of black pastors and and this is what she said she said the most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal we don't want the word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members now I'm not sure that her statement about educating quote rebellious Negroes does much to debunk the racism charges I don't think it does but I do know that she explicitly desired to eradicate the undesirables and then the organization that she founded which was later known as Planned Parenthood though at the time when she founded I think was called the birth control League or something like that that organization would then go on to actually eradicate over 7 million undesirables according to her I don't think that's a coincidence you see I think she had this idea and then the organization found it one went on to carry out that idea praying especially on minority neighbor neighborhoods and killing a disproportionate number of black babies that's not a coincidence now ironically the this bust of Margaret Sanger has been defended the person who runs the National Portrait estate defended it on the grounds that her racist views mirrored her time so they were you know part of the historical context and also the National Portrait Institute said that well the the effort to remove the bust is really part of an ideologically motivated campaign and the backlash against the various monuments to Harvey Milk has also been blocked on the basis that while you're only trying to tear those down and you only want to get rid of those because you're anti gay but these are exactly the arguments that defenders of Confederate statues make it's exact same argument what they'll say is that the troubling aspects of the Confederacy must be seen within their historical context and they'll also say that the effort to wipe these statues out is more political than it is ethical now it would seem to me that in the interests of integrity and consistency we must we must decide going to apply that consistently or not are we going to tear down all of the problematic statues or none of them to focus on just one sort of problematic statute and to ignore the the the monuments that enshrine other kinds of historical evil or other historically evil characters to do that is to basically admit that the attack on Confederate statues is really nothing more than a political stunt so we just have to make up our mind that's the point thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
