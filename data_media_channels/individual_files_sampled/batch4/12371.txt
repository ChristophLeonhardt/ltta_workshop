well the clave endless weekend is almost upon us and before the planet swirls down into a fathomless an unnatural 72-hour darkness that will make the damn denizens of hell wipe their flaming brows with gratitude that they haven't been condemned to remain on earth let's take a jolly look back at the days just past and review the events that make us all feel we're living in what used to be the greatest country ever to turn to ashes reeking with the fed of aroma of insanity and corruption over the last several days the choice that has been set before us in the upcoming presidential election at last became clear and the differences between the candidates were made manifest through their actions Hilary you'll remember tripped climbing up a flight of stairs causing some reporters to speculate that her pure hunger for power had turned her mind into a percolating worm-ridden soup no longer capable of controlling the actions of a body in which the soul had been eaten to nothing by greed and evil leaving the flesh to begin the process of decay even before the onset of death Donald Trump meanwhile tried to declare his economic policy for America's cities but instead of saying cities he accidentally uttered a rude expression for a woman's breasts revealing that even in the midst of his speech he was thinking back to those great days with Bill Clinton on convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's jet nickname the Lolita expressed when Trump and Bill could share an ice cold cocktail and a nice warm 15 year old and joke about how funny it would be if Trump decided to run for president and destroy the Republican Party leaving Hillary Clinton a clear path to the White House and then prison meanwhile during a conversation with reporters Hillard Hillary accidentally referred to trump as her husband revealing that she was thinking about the same thing then new Clinton emails were released providing evidence that Hillary had sold government favors for cash and Hillary reacted by sneaking up and back of the DNC worker who released the emails and shooting him twice then dragging his body to a secluded location in a washington DC park and burying it in a shallow grave while attorney general Loretta Lynch danced around the corpse with her arms flung to the sky as she shrieked a satanic incantation that conjured a demon from the flaming bowels of the earth who cast a curse of moral madness over the entire nation before returning to the Oval Office to finish his second term as president Trump responded by putting on clown makeup but riding a unicycle in circles around his podium until he fell off the edge of the stage leading CNN to produce a five hour long documentary questioning whether the businessman was as qualified as mrs. Clinton who had the experience poise and good judgment to shoot a man in the back and get away with it while simultaneously conjuring a demon as Wolf Blitzer put it quote here's a woman who can really multitask while Donald Trump can't even ride a damned unicycle unquote all in all I think every patriotic Americans heart can take encouragement from the fact that if the clave endless weekend should indeed swallow us in near eternal darkness it'll actually be a big improvement over the rest of the week trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan show I think I think they finally driven me insane I think that's what's that as I was thinking who wrote this oh no it was me it is a strange strange week I can only imagine how crazy the clave Willis weekend's going to be luckily I won't be here because it's Clavin list all right we're gonna talk a lot to talk about but oh boy we've got we've got breaking news in New York Times reporter said something true and we're gonna guess we're going to get to it I hope you'll be here because you only get the first 15 minutes of the show on Facebook live and then the party starts that's when we're dancing the singing that girls come on it's incredible so you have to come to the daily wire or you can download it on iTunes or SoundCloud and then subscribe and you can see the whole thing plus get into the mail back we had a good mail back yesterday some good questions yes and so you got to get in there if you're going to ask your questions and find out the truth about everything also I just want to reiterate that if you want to sign copy a lot of people been asking me for how to get their copies of the great good thing my memoir that is coming out it's supposed to come out next month it'll probably be available sooner than that but if you preorder the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ you can send me the receipt by email at a Clavin at daily wire calm and I will use the address on the receipt to send you a sign sticker that you can put in the book and there it is and just tell me then you want me to sign I'll usually do that with checks but I'll do that with the book as well okay I'm sorry I'm just riffing here all right so here's the thing something truly amazing happened in New York Times reporter actually told the truth and we're going to get to it in a second because first we have to talk about what's we've got these dueling visions basically of the world these dueling stories that come out one is Donald Trump makes this stupid comment about the Second Amendment he basically says if hillary gets in she's gonna point judges will destroy the Second Amendment nothing you can do oh but maybe if you're one of these Second Amendment people you can do something so he's guts makes it basically you know I thought he should have come out and said I really sorry what I meant to say his killer Keller I just wanted so everybody gets upset now you know a lot of people have talked about this that there has been I mean especially during the George W Bush presidency there was a lot of talk about assassination there was a movie that was made it was called death of the president that predicted this I think that was 2006 it came out of one awards in Europe it was in festivals when people gave it good reviews I have to say I have to say to be absolutely fair that Hillary Clinton did condemn that movie she did say it was despicable and a terrible thing to do and there was also Nicholson Baker who is a prominent literary novelist he's one of those guys that nobody reads but people like me he wrote a book called checkpoint in which they also discussed killing the president I mean these things were out there they was getting good reviews and again to be fair the New York Times did call the book scummy they really went after it and it was scum is I mean that's a terrible sitting presidents so and and so Hilary has has earned the right to strike back a trump which he did so give us the Hillary content let me say something about what I think is a critical difference between my opponent and myself words matter my friends and if you are running to be President or you are president of the United States words can have tremendous consequences yesterday we witness the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line his casual cruelty to a gold star family his casual suggestion that more countries should have nuclear weapons and now his casual inciting of violence every single one of these incidents shows us that Donald Trump simply does not have the temperament to be president and commander and chief of the United States okay so that's one side and this is Hillary's campaign now Donald Trump said something stupid never mind you know the last eight years never mind my dishonesty never mind my corruption never mind everything out Donald Trump said something stupid and Donald Trump keeps giving her the material to run that campaign so that's working out really well for her the polls show it but that's one side that's one story ok the other story is of course this these new emails that are released from Judicial Watch which is this conservative watchdog group that just keeps filing foi a reports that's all they do Freedom of Information Act reports requests give us these documents give us these documents so this there's this is a double it not a triple whammy it's certainly a double whammy the emails come out and they show that if you gave money to the Clinton Foundation you got access to the State Department through Hillary Clinton's aids so Hillary Clinton is in she's the secretary of state she made an agreement with Obama because Obama remember Obama is a plays dirty pool he's that he silences his critics he intimidates people uses the IRS he's totally politicized the Justice Department he's used the FCC the judge the judge just struck down the FCC trying to take control of people's Wi-Fi you know I mean Obama is a tuft Chicago Paul who is out to destroy his enemies and silence them but but he's not money corrupt he is not you know money corrupt is a very special thing you have to really really be a greedy you know dirty person to be corrupt Obama is an ideologue so he made an agreement with Hillary Clinton yes you can be Secretary of State but you've got to separate the Clinton Foundation the slush fund from your business at Secretary of State now these emails come out and this is why this is why she had a private server as I have been saying to you for over a year now the real dirt is not whether she exposed some spy in Iran though she might have she might have done that but the real dirt is why did she do it in the first place why did she do it in the first place we know it wasn't for convenience we know it wasn't for all the reasons she said it was to hide this pay-for-play arrangement that she had with donors if you give her enough money through the Clinton Foundation if you pay bill enough to make a speech if you pay her enough to make a speech you got access plus you know not only that these are emails also show that the Department of Justice just turned a blind eye to this they don't have enough evidence we don't have enough evidence to you know prosecute any of this business with the Clinton Foundation so they are completely complicit in this plus you know even though Washington Post which has been relentlessly anti-trump relentlessly one-sided they ran a story reminding people first of all they pointed out that when Clinton Senator in New York she promised that she was going to bring 200,000 jobs to New York no way not even close not i mean hard to find any jobs that she brought to New York New York upstate New York has really been in terrible shape she did nothing but in the article they mentioned almost offhandedly in the Senate Clinton cultivated a mutually beneficial relationship with corning and upstate manufacturer of glass and high-tech products we all know Corning Glass we're through legislation and federal grants she helped steer money to Corning to support its diesel emissions reduction technology Corning employees have donated to Clinton's campaigns at a massive clip and corning's chief executive co-hosted a 2015 razor for her the company page or two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars it's a little more than I get for a speech in 2014 to speak to Corning executives Corning also has given more than a hundred thousand dollars to the Clinton Foundation its records show she has been selling your government to people okay so Ron Fournier reporter for the National Journal used to be a big ap guy he points out why this is a double whammy it was people very close to the Clintons including a source who's been working with the Clintons for more than two decades who told me the week that the New York Times expose this this rogue server that what this was all about was the foundation that that the blurring the lines between their political and professional lives that's what was in the emails was to look for the pay to play this kind of favor giving you know is this story disturbing to you what we found out about this back and forth between the foundation and the State Department what should Americans be concerned because you don't want to have politicians who are giving favors to donors you know that's that's obviously an ethical breach plus we have the trust issue here Hillary Clinton told us that all of her work related email are turned over this is yet another example where we're finding email that weren't turned over wait I got it I white white boy why wasn't this one turned over this is fairly significant is it not oh very significant we have found you know there's been dozens maybe hundreds they haven't been turned over among the 30,000 that she deleted you know through lawsuits and the FBI's investigation were uncovering emails that that should have been uncovered and work so so she's corrupt twice right now she influence peddling she's influence peddling and she's dumping the emails you know this is remember she keeps saying I've turned over everything I've turned over everything we getting more and more they you know we're getting more and more of these things that she did not turn over okay so these are the two stories that are running yesterday according to the media research center which is a right wing center but I you know I know these guys they're just basically studying the media the mainstream media is reporting on the percentage of you know who covers what they're saying that this Trump gaffe and if that's what it was he's got this kind of offbeat sense of humor he doesn't think and he doesn't think before he talks this got four times the coverage four times the coverage of Hillary Clinton's emails here's Tim Graham on talking to eric bolling on Fox from mr.c it's getting worse as we go along and in particular CBS is really standing out here because they have 14 minutes on Trump 21 on Hillary so they're really skewing the whole thing but it just shows you a general election pattern that they always have which is take whatever the gaff is like binders full of women and completely exaggerated it and hyper inflate it and with the Democrats it's like what story yeah so do you find it it's consistent along all medium in other words broadcast medium versus network and versus cable yeah generally the pattern is is the same all the way across and what's really interesting sometimes is when you think that newspapers are going to be more in depth and offer you more on some of these Hillary scandals and then once you find when you go back and you look at it is no you know for example the network's totally jumped all over kai zircon speech to the Democratic convention the network's ignored Patricia Smith you look at the newspapers you find the same thing okay so we're going to get to so Jeremy Peters a new york times reporter actually spoke the truth and this is very rare for New York Times because that's not what they're in the business of doing what we're going to talk about that after the break we're going to have to say goodbye to you at Facebook and at YouTube still I think yeah okay so long but come to the daily wire here the rest of the show
