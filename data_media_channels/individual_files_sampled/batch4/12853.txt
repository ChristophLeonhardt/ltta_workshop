analyze what the riots mean for the United States and the world order then a man to press to giacomo and amber Athey joined the panel of deplorable z to talk Huma Comey and the deep state DOJ the first abortion clinic free state in the Union and the widespread shock that a youtube star known only for smashing dinner plates on the Internet has turned out to be somewhat gauche I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show Happy New Year everybody well it feels like it's been forever that we haven't been on the air another Kingdom my podcast with Andrew Klavan has also been on a hiatus I got a bunch of hate mail about that but it's going back this Friday and I I did want to share with you before we get in there's a lot of news to talk about today but I haven't seen you since we had our daily wire Christmas party it was a lovely affair there were ugly sweaters and everybody came and Ben gave me my Christmas present so I was very excited he it came in a little blue box and you know you know what that does to a girl when she sees a little blue box I got very excited my heart started to flutter and then he gave me that's right almost a diamond almost a diamond it is it is a lump of coal this was my Christmas present from Ben but you know someday after enough time that's gonna that's gonna be a diamond and I'll and I'll wear it right on my finger it'll be really nice so thank you for that I hope everyone had a good Christmas and a good New Year let's get right into the news did you know that there are violent protests throughout Iran maybe now you do but did you know three days ago when they started happening because there has been a media blackout of coverage and I'm not talking about the Iranian state-run media that also has a blackout but on Thursday as the anti-government protests in Iran were reaching critical mass throughout the country The Washington Post democracy dies in darkness put protests for democracy in total darkness instead the Washington Post covered these were their main headlines on their website quote late-night writers dish about their favorite moments in 2017 Democrats think 2018 will be a good year but they are are they being realistic and Trump's respite at mar-a-lago creates headaches for White House staffers they they also ran a peace making excuses for why Americans distrust the mainstream media you absolutely cannot make that up CNN ran the alternate fact fake news headline Iranians hold pro-government rallies not quite right I think you're sort of missing the forest for the trees there there are major anti-government protests now throughout the country including in the most religious and conservative cities in Iran why the media blackout you ask well because those protests reflect very poorly on Barack Obama of course we can't cover that we can't cover things critical of Barack Obama so about the Obama's trouble with Iran began in 2009 there was the green movement there he refused to support the anti-government protestors he wouldn't help them at at all it died out a lot of people were imprisoned and killed for that his signature foreign policy achievement was the Iran deal after which Barack Obama flew 400 million dollars in cash to the thuggish regime and 1.3 billion dollars in additional funding that was opened up to Iran Iran is the most prolific state sponsor of terror in the world and yet here is Barack Obama touting that deal today because America negotiated from a position of strength and principle we have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region because of this deal the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon this deal meets every single one of the bottom lines that we established when we achieved a framework earlier this spring every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off and the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place here is footage of Ayatollah Khomeini negotiating the deal he has perfect English I am shocked at what how an excellent English the Ayatollah has that is much more accurate virtually nothing Barack Obama said was true we didn't I guess we negotiated from a position of strength we just didn't exercise any of that strength it doesn't cut off the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear weapon if anything it hastens it by giving them a ton more capital obviously they started cheating on the deal right away according to a number of foreign policy experts so it was a total failure just like every other Barack Obama negotiating technique we give them anything we give our adversaries everything for some reason we sell flagellate we apologize for things we never did and then they get everything and they smack us around for it and it wasn't only Republicans who pointed out that this was a terrible deal here his current Democrat Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's take a mint quote I will vote to disapprove the agreement not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option not to challenge the path of dis plumbin C is because I believe Iran will not change do you know how many times I agree with Chuck Schumer ever in history very few this might be the one exception but obviously he felt strongly about it and his vote didn't matter ultimately for the deal so he voted his conscience and what his what his donors and his constituents wanted so what should the United States position be I as always and with the so subtle john bolton right so I think we do need to provide assistance I think we can do it in several ways number one this is yet another reason why the president should get out of the nuclear deal with Iran should resume all of our previous sanctions putting increased economic pressure on the regime we should provide material financial support to the opposition if they desire it we should work with intelligence services from other countries Saudi Israel to provide more pressure there's a lot we can do and we should do it our goal should be regime change in Iran john bolton doesn't mince words I think he's exactly right president Trump by the way his voiced support for the Iranian protesters he tweeted out for major tweets of Memphis he said many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with the regime's corruption its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism Iranian government should respect their people's rights including the right to express themselves the world is watching later the big protests in Iran people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism looks like they will not take it any longer the USA is watching very closely for human rights violations next week Iran the number one state sponsor of terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the internet not good and then finally Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them probably Obama administration the great Iranian people have been repressed for many years they're hungry for food and for freedom along with human rights the wealth of Iran is being looted time for change how ominous with that we bring on Iran expert Joshi Asma who has contributed reporting on these protests to a number of major outlets and so I brought on Josh to clear this up because nobody knows anything about Iran Josh thank you for being here thanks for having what's going on what should we know about this so these protests began late Thursday and they began rather small they began as an anti rouhani protest and so Ron is the the president rouhani is a car is a leader president Hassan rouhani this is a guy who was touted by the Obama administration as a moderate and he didn't point out the fact that executions have skyrocketed under rouhani attacks acid attacks against women have skyrocketed this is not a good guy he's not a moderate the the whole hardliner moderate dichotomy just is pure fiction because this is all we heard from Barack Obama's there's a moderate in Iran rouhani is a moderate we should support him to liberalize Iran that's nonsense you're saying it's absolute nonsense and the reason why is every presidential candidate is vetted by the mullahs there's something called The Guardian Council and the Guardian Council of Vettes candidates and we saw back in 2009 they didn't like a candidate most savvy and that's that's why we had the Green Revolution because the mullahs suppressed this candidate and they said that we're only going to put fourth candidates that are vetted and that subscribe to the Islamist regime toe the party line to the Islamist line so how should the United States respond I think the Trump administration has been doing a good job so far it's funny that could just be the the mantra of my show the sense of the show began I think the Trump administration has been doing pretty good so far to be fair I've been a pretty avid trump critic so I don't say that lightly he's been doing a good job nikki Haley spoke earlier today and she said that we're going to hold an emergency session at the United Nations we're going to support the Iranian people and they've been doing a good job at not inciting and not giving the ayatollahs an excuse to make it seem like there is Western interference blame all of this on the West it's just the West stirring up trouble yes and the ayatollahs are gonna do that anyway and they have been Khamenei he spoke out for the first time Tuesday and he blamed the the enemies of the Iranian regime so what practically I don't think we're gonna put boots on the ground but I do have greater faith in nikki Haley and Donald Trump to back up their threats with action something that Barack Obama never did what materially what tangibly can the United States do to support this movement so first and foremost we need to understand that this movement would not have happened several years ago the reason why is because now about 50 million Iranians have access to the Internet and this revolution if you could call it that is being fueled by an app called telegram telegram is huge Iranians use it it's very Farsi friendly videos are being uploaded and right now telegram is being blocked by the Iranian regime the Iranian regime is blocking internet in most major cities they're blocking social media twitter has been blocked since 2009 and what the United States needs to do they need to put pressure on companies like telegram they need to be pressure on social media outlets to keep the lines of communication open because that's the lifeline of the of the protest base that is like shut down the communication this thing I mean this is all over the country and some of the most religious cities exactly there's a city called home and them is the Shia heartland of Iran this is a place where in 1962 Ayatollah Khomeini began his Islamist revolution and you we had protesters there Friday Friday after prayer and this is when people the people get riled up this is when the Imams come out and rile up the people and they went out in the clerical heartland of the city and said death to the Islamic Republic death to Khamenei that's like let's get going ayatollah exact leader of iran exactly it could be killed for that they could be killed and right now in tehran 450 arrests the regime has already said that they face they face the death penalty they're gonna kill them or they have to kill them although they may kill them all or like they did in 2009 they could torture them really brutally Wow so speaking of Ayatollah Khomeini and it's a little confusing the old guy was Khomeini and the new guy is Khamenei coming comment yeah I don't care I don't do ya know I always noticed this my lefty friends they always try to pronounce things very exaggerated Lee native so they'll say you know like like Muslim Pakistan but I don't go to Italian restaurants and say like okay I'd like to order the spaghetti and I kind of bone out a bit father would have been no you just you know so I like to very ostentatiously pronounce them in an anglicized way now what their one thing they're chanting in the streets according to the reporting that we have is bring back the Shah the Shah who was ousted in the Iranian Revolution what what does that mean it's a way to defy the regime there is no topic more taboo in the Islamic Republic of Iran than the Shah this is this is why we had the 1979 revolution you had Islamist factions you had the working poor stand up and say we don't want the autocratic Shah and to be to be clear the Schad does not have immense support in Iran and he does not have the immense support in the iranian exile community it's just like a screw you basically it's basically screw you and it's basically a way to invoke nostalgia for a time in a place that was better than now to make iran great again exactly the shot 2018 thank you Ron great again so the last thing I want to talk to you about the Obama fans are taking credit for this and they're saying look the deal gave them a ton of money and it exposed weaknesses in their economy which then led to another protest which were we still in power we wouldn't support it all but because we're not in power we'll take some credit for it is this all revisionist nonsense or is there something to it it's revisionist nonsense that's what I thought I'm glad you said there is I mean check Twitter the probably the most smug human being on the planet Ben Rhodes I knew you were gonna say Ben Rhodes the smuggest he is he is awful he was smug in office yeah he was the one who who joked about how he fooled the American people and they were all a bunch of rubes yeah Javad Zarif who was iran's Foreign Minister he negotiated the Iran nuclear deal with Kerry he's he was a smartest man in the room and he fooled he fooled Americans essentially and what we're seeing now is we're seeing a backlash by the Iranian people because Rohani over-promised yeah as a result of the nuclear do the nuclear deal he said that this is going to open up the world the banking system sanctions relief and he didn't deliver and Iran is still impoverished drug drug abuse is up prostitution is up and these people are suffering and the Obama administration did little to alleviate their misery rouhani has done very little to help the working poor and bear in mind that the the regime always blames these sorts of dissonant movements on the middle or upper classes right and because they draw a huge portion of their support from the working class and that's because they've made the working class dependent on the government's and welfare benefits it's all handouts for the working all handouts and they expect blind allegiance in return and this is very much a working-class revolution it looks like they started it now it seems from the reporting I read the working class started this as an economic movement and not only later did the middle classes jump on about political oppression and suppression but this began with the with the working poor in Iran that's exactly right it began as an anti rouhani protest that basically they express their grievances over the lack of economic growth but it's become an anti Ayatollah oh it has as of Friday it became a political movement so it's not it's no longer it's no longer just about the regime that happens to be running the government this is about the whole governmental system and structure of Iran they want to tear it all down Wow gotta love it it's kind of like in America we do that sometimes a little less bloody a little a little more fun you know it's tear down the establishment but clearly anti-establishment movements have spread even to Iran and maybe the United States will support it okay we're gonna keep you around for the panel can you stick around of course okay we have an excellent panel you no longer have to look at his mug you can look over we have a man to press to Giacomo and amber 82 come on and lighten the place up a little bit but before we do that I'm sorry guys if you're on Facebook and YouTube you got it over to daily wire.com we thank everybody who already subscribes you help keep the lights on you help keep cafe in

back ladies thank you for being here happy New Year to Amanda and amber Happy New Year thanks for having us so let's get right into the news let's get right into the Trump tweets I was I was kind of tuned out from Twitter and the news over Christmas and New Year's but I would still check his tweets and he had some golden ones so this one today he tweeted quote crooked Hillary Clinton's top aide uma Abidine has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents remember sailors pictures on submarine jail deep State Justice Department must finally act also on Comey and others this oh happy New Year to us Amanda should Hillary and Huma go to the clink isn't there something unsavory about sending political opponents to jail I don't think Trump actually wants that to happen I think he's just riling up his base and making a point that there's been no real evidence of collusion and he's in all this trouble they have this big investigation and you know on the other side we have emma-crats who were clearly break like breaking the law being completely negligent and nothing happens so I don't I don't think we want to put Hillary in jail as much as I would personally love that because it it would be breaking precedent success very impressive actually wants to do that yeah an Amber that's a great point Amanda I mean this is basically Donald Trump's first tweet of the new year he sent out a few others but you know early morning on the first day back from work with so much going his way the economy tax reform foreign affairs why is Donald Trump setting off this news cycle with Huma and jail and crooked Hillary's old campaign pals okay I also didn't hear what Amanda said so if I repeat anything she said I apologize I know I was also just dumbstruck gazing at her beauty but and this happens to a lot of people we have to persevere yeah but I mean so actually I have to take a little bit of credit here being at the Daily Caller because the Daily Caller released a report this morning about Huma her passwords to Yahoo which was then hacked by a foreign spy so Trump obviously saw the report thought it was worth tweeting out and I think we're all pretty honored here that he kicked off the new year with a tweet about one of our reports that is really gold and the Daily Caller by the way is one of my favorite websites with the word daily in it it is one of them hopefully about Daily Mail you know that's certainly the case Josh he talked about the deep state but isn't the Justice Department run by Trump's own appointees why would he call them the deep State I think trub should stay off Twitter for a little while you know there's this whole bashing Hillary thing it's been a year get over it start governing ayahs governing he's doing a great job governing I'm sorry to cut you I'm not that sorry to cut you I love the truth I think the conventional wisdom says get off Twitter don't tweet you're hurting your own agenda he's been incredibly effective in his first year he's been more effective than any first year Republican administration that I can think of in history and he's been tweeting the whole way distracting the media setting the news cycles I love it like give me the Marco FFA the more the better any other thoughts on that I hate to cut you off but I don't really I don't really mind frankly I just like to hear nikki Haley talk but that's just me fair enough that's true I'll watch Trump tweeting listen to nikki Haley talk okay there is one little aspect of this which is he is keeping the fire on Democrats he's keeping the fire on the double standard as Amanda said you're gonna hear more about Bob Muller or they're gonna find somebody to indict you could indict a ham sandwich and so he's keeping the fire on them pointing out their corruption ironically their own collusion and I'm a big fan of this and let's not forget they're 100 and some odd thousand employees of the Justice Department and so the question of the deep state is not some crazy conspiracy it's a point that Antonin Scalia himself raised many times which is that the great threat to freedom in the United States or these unaccountable executive agencies that have gotten too much power and not enough accountability and if Donald Trump is going to rein them in in kind of quirky and uncouth ways that's fine by me the point is we have to rein them in and and I'm fine with it and I'll enjoy the co5 a well it happened okay another excellent news story Kentucky is poised to be the first state in the country to be abortion clinic free Amanda you covered this for The Daily wire and if you haven't checked it out I don't want to ruin it go over and read Amanda's piece because her writing is so good and she uses very funny word choice Amanda thank you is this a trend that we're gonna see spread to other states there are seven states right now that have one abortion clinic left and I think the pro-life movement has been doing a really good job of basically getting these these places closed down it and of course voters and winning over Congress and getting Republicans in office has really helped us and now that we have president Trump as well you know eventually defunding Planned Parenthood yes this trend is going to continue and these are basic safety standards that the pro-life movement is pouncing on as they should I mean there have been women who have been killed because of Borch botched abortions so that's just a basic regulation like you have to have context with an ambulance so they can come if God forbid something happens if you can't comply you can't get a license and that's what's happening in Kentucky so the pro-life movement is being really smart and they're caring about women's safety and as a result they're stopping the deaths of a lot of babies and saving a lot of mothers and it's been this tremendous growth over time as as you point out the pro-life movement has gained a lot of steam now we're having major victories like ridding whole states of these abortion clinics which are awful the media would always black out all the awful stories about abortion clinics killing women injuring women right obviously improperly disposing of babies bodies the Gosnell stories that is probably the biggest example of this total media blackout now amber yeah what does the success of the pro-life movement tell us about other seemingly hopeless social movements we were told for years abortion is a done deal it was decided by the supreme or move on there are other fish to fry but is that the case what what about other movements say redefining marriage say other aspects of culture that the pronoun issue the bathroom issue are these lost causes or should the cultural right fight back I wouldn't say that they're necessarily lost causes in the case of gay marriage that one might mean so just because abortion is a little bit of a trickier issue because there are ways to restrict it without violating the Supreme Court's decision I'm not sure that a similar analogy exists for gay marriage but I think it's definitely is a testament to just how effective these grassroots movements from pro-life people really are and just how effective they've been in pushing back against especially the feminist narratives that what they call reproductive justice which just means abortion is somehow a women's rights issue and they've really been able to reframe that narrative to everyone has a right to life and that includes unborn children so I think you know it's something a testament to the strength of the grassroots movements if that extends to other social movements it kind of depends on the particular intricacies of those debates as well absolutely right and in news that is much less important than saving babies and women throughout the United States and re-establishing the world order and taking away terrorist regimes we have to talk about a youtube store in utterly shocking news the YouTube star Logan Paul posted a video walking through a Japanese forest in which he stumbled upon a post suicide corpse some guy who had killed himself in Japan here's a censored clip of the video one of my classmate in the junior high school he really killed himself oh yeah what he was kidding only 21 no Logan excuse me now the Internet is seriously piling on this guy he pulled the video pretty quickly he apologized immediately he even seemed pretty shaken in the video he made several serious statements in it about how suicide isn't a joke there's help reach out if you need help that sort of thing he is one of the biggest stars on YouTube and there are now widespread calls to D monetize his channel something we all know a lot about on the conservative side of YouTube we know a lot about D monetizing they people want to kick him off of YouTube to put this in his channel has almost three billion views and here is one present did you know that was gonna shatter I mean I don't know plastic shatters like glass sorry hi art in 2017 2018 Amanda is it it really shocking that a guy who's only demonstrable talent is smashing dinner plates in his apartment then he might be somewhat gauche why is everybody piling on this guy yeah I didn't I didn't know who he was I still kind of don't and and I won't watch that clip because I just can't do it but yeah I don't I don't know I think that Ben Shapiro wrote a piece about this today and it's it's kind of like this outrage culture like the Ponzi scheme where you know if you're more outraged you have more virtue so it is disgusting and I totally good with that but people feel good calling other people out because you know they're better than that so there's a lot of there's a lot of virtue signaling going on then even though it's probably expected for this person it doesn't matter you're gonna you're gonna look like a good person for calling this this out even though you know everyone knows yeah that was a bad move and then he pulled it because it was a bad move he knew it was a bad move he apologized profusely I think genuinely even in the video he appeared pretty genuinely shaken by it and was making serious statements I think Ben's piece on it if you haven't read it it's at the Daily wire it was really good it was really spot-on it's so easy it's so cost free to say oh look at that awful terrible person yes I agree aren't we both wonderful together but it's all these Twitter hashtag movements like you have to really do anything you just you just put out a statement throw in a hashtag and you're a good person right so it's it doesn't make any sense that's slacktivism it's that hashtag yeah some of yes I take mental health and suicide very seriously see I tweeted about it I tweeted I'm gonna love me love me now Josh does an apology ever suffice anymore you know he made a mistake he apologized in the age of insta Fame why are people so quick to judge to be honest I don't understand why people aren't talking about the cultural condition in Japan why are we talking about this slightly for just do if you have an aging population in Japan you have you know their economy has gone slightly down you have they can't replace their workforce young Japanese men have a lot of weirdness about sex they're not having sex they're all addicted to porn are they're all addicted to porn let's talk about Japan let's talk about the young men killing themselves why are we talking about this buffoon I don't I don't understand that's a phenomenal point because I'm looking at this from a bizarrely cultural perspective why we have this outraged culture whyever everyone else is looking at it from the other side of that cultural paradigm which is we need to kill this guy and he's really famous for doing nothing and shrieking like an animal on the internet but now we have to smack him around because apparently he's not very polite the thing that he's talking about the video that he's actually making shows a bizarre phenomenon in Japan but no one wants to talk about that that's too hard and serious and not clicky enough there that you don't smash a lot of plates when you're talking about suicide do you it's not as interesting amber is the fame of people like this guy or other totally nonsensical YouTube stars represent a shift in culture it's so easy conservatives are always talking about the decay and culture and everything's awful now and you know rock and roll is gonna make all the kids immoral or is this guy just a clown like we've had in every single era well if I understand correctly I think the vast majority of his fan base is like young kids and middle schoolers who are really attracted to that yeah they're I mean obviously they're gonna be attracted to this kind of like a slapstick kind of humor I guess if you could even call it humor but I think this also speaks to a larger point about what technology has is doing to our lives in the sense that every part of this person's life is considered content for his YouTube channel there's nothing about him that's private and so for him going into the woods and seeing a person who had just committed suicide was just another piece of viral content it was a way for him to get views and that's what happens when people live their lives behind a camera or behind a phone is that everything is just another way for people to click on you and think that you're interesting and it never runs out there's you always need a higher high you always need more outrageous content if your whole shtick is not to analyze anything or to produce any art or do anything within confines if it's just a shock then eventually you're going to end up the guy hanging from a tree in Japan because that's right analysts this was like the holy grail of content for him I mean if it was allowed to stay up on YouTube I can only imagine how many views he would have gotten out of it then that is the question how do I get more clicks how do I get more views and yet you see people when they fly a little too close to the Sun when people are only provocateurs and they're not offering any value I don't want to call out people on the right but of certain of these provocateurs their names might run with bi-lo you Napoles when they all they do is an outrage and they don't offer any substance then eventually you're going to go a little too far and you're gonna fizzle out I wonder if maybe that insta Fame coaches is finally recognizing that with one of the biggest stars on YouTube now going down in flames if maybe there will be a shift even on that platform but who knows that they're gonna demonetised and censor all of us before before any of that happens so we won't be around to see it okay ladies thank you for being here happy new year so good to see what a great way to start off 2018 Josh a much less enjoyable way to start off 2018 but
