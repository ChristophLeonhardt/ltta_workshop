there's a graphic now going around on social media ten ways you can actively reject your white privilege the people pushing this are serious and then they suggest that we must all abide by the strictures recommended in this post if we wish for a better country so let's deconstruct this nonsense okay number one says take up minimal space during anti racism dialogues and protests minimal space I didn't know that's supposed to mean should white people who don't like themselves put themselves in like mine boxes should they take alice-in-wonderland potion and shrink down or better yet should they simply stop showing up what's the big worry here man spreading intimidation of the people who happen not to share a skin color but who share the same ideas regarding politics I'd recommend that leftist lighten up but they'd probably think that was racist they said they then say second stop contributing to gentrification and calling it urban development stop investing in downtrodden areas and building nice homes and shops people keep those downtrodden areas racially segregated at least they're historic the last thing we would want is people in those historic areas to have jobs and safer neighborhoods and nice restaurants they must be relegated to poverty for the sake of the character of the place three listen when people call you on your microaggressions I suppose this means not jumping from the nearest window which is actually kind of a sacrifice for never invite people of color to the table for the sake of claiming diversity I actually agree with this one how about we just invite people to the table who are interesting and have knowledge rather than judging them by their skin colour but you know doesn't agree Hillary Clinton she actually suggested having a black person to be named later in her cabinet for the sake of claiming diversity five and refrain from using your non-white friends as your urban dictionary not sure who does this who turns to their black friend and asks them to decode rap songs anybody then again if you actually talk about black cultural hallmarks and you're not black then your white splaining or you're engaging in cultural appropriation so it's a little bit of a catch-22 six stop lifting up non-confrontational people of color as example of what people of color activism should be stopped talking about Martin Luther King jr. instead let's pretend that the Black Panthers and early Malcolm X we're better examples of black liberation even if they actually resulted in you know counterproductive backlashes that hurt their causes it's not like nonviolent resistance is actually succeeded in America or anything 7 call your friends family and co-workers out on racism even if a person of color isn't in the room this actually seems like a good idea like this post that discussing right now it's racist Hey understand that all anti-racism work doesn't look the same and advocate accordingly this means that you should let everybody do what they please up to and including riots in Ferguson presumably nine realize that all discussions about race aren't for you and be okay with it you see if you're called racist or for discussing racism you should shut up as your white it's not for you yes about you and yet you're the problem and yet you suck but shut up that's not racism you know to tell white people to shut up when discussing how much they suck that's rejecting white privilege it's your privilege to speak so we have to reject that privilege 10 recognize that you're still racist no matter what well I mean to be honest this sort of defeats the purpose of points one through nine we could you skip to this one and then do whatever we want anyway since we'll never actually be able to escape our white privilege so thanks leftists for ensuring that racism lives on and forcing people to shut up based on skin color you've done us all a real service at least in exposing your own more illuminated nasai Manship hero this is the Ben Shapiro show you know every time you think that you've actually parodied the left sufficiently they parody themselves and it all goes out the window I want to talk a lot about Trump care today because the new Congressional Budget Office report is out and it basically sucks there's a bunch in it that is not true or there's a bunch in it that is based on faulty premises and the entire left is going totally insane over it and clearly there is a division of opinion about the CBO report from the right as well you have some people like Paul Ryan who are touting the CBO report because he hit his head on something hard when he was a child and he has some people in the Trump administration saying the CBO report doesn't mean anything even though they used to cite the CBO report about Obama we'll get to all of that in just a second but first we have to say thank you to our sponsors at Bull and branch so if you are somebody who really does not sleep well one of the reasons you're not sleeping well I would guess is because the quality of your sheets is terrible I know this because this was my problem I used to sleep on the most uncomfortable sheets I mean it was like stuff that you bought at the local 7-eleven in the parking lot from the shady guy who probably stole it from a truck similar and it was all garbage and I'd know the difference you know they say thread count a thousand a thousand is better than 900 that means that that is an awesome sheet and it turns out that it actually is just the tarp that the homeless guy used to cover the the dumpster and back in the store well actually if you want a solid sheet you know like a sheet that is going to allow you to breathe it's a breathable sheet they're really comfortable they're so comfortable I've now bought I think three or four pairs of these on my own because they're so good bull and branch sheets are the place to do it I think three ex-presidents sleep on bull and branch sheets plus Bill Clinton's lovers presumably you'll be so comfortable that you will fall asleep faster and you'll sleep deeper and you will wake up refreshed which is a big thing if you're not getting enough sleep if you if you work hard bull and branch eats are absolute quality they're crafted from 100% organic cotton they also look fantastic they are better looking sheets than the crap that you're likely to get at your local save on so make sure that you over to Boleyn branch calm right now and they are cheaper than most of the designer customer sheets because they are really it's direct-to-consumer so it's really it's it's terrific stuff I can't I can't praise their products more highly Boleyn branch calm today bol L and branch calm today you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets plus free shipping

discount plus it means that they know that we sent you which is helpful to the podcast already so let's jump right in here so the CBO comes out with its new report on the the Obamacare replacement bill and it is not a flattering report it is not a good report and you wouldn't expect it to be a good report because the bill is actually really not a good bill as I've stated before there are a bunch of problems with the bill so it's not a shock that the CBO didn't like the bill but let's go through some of the things that are in the bill so Robert Cray check over at today Lee Weyer has pretty good breakdown when what's in this thing the stuff that Republicans liked is that the deficit is supposed to go down so right now that's important because there are certain bills in place that say that if the CBO estimates that costs will go up then it's very hard to pass a bill if you say that see if the CBO says the costs will go down then it's easier to pass a bail one of the reasons this is stupid is because the CBO is wrong about pretty much everything the CBO report on Obamacare is just incorrect when they estimate that a lot of coverage is gonna happen through Medicaid they're assuming a bunch of states are going to expand their Medicaid in accordance with Obamacare they're not doing that so there are so many states that haven't joined Medicaid will join Medicaid or expand their Medicaid rather and that's not happening so the CBO reports are very very flawed but the CBO here estimates the budget deficit will be 559 billion in fiscal year 2017 but they say that the American Health Care Act this is Trump care would reduce federal deficits 337 billion dollars over nine years now the real number is like over a trillion dollars over the next nine years but then we give a bunch of tax cuts they say that this takes away from the government so it actually is only going to reduce the deficit by about 400 billion three hundred thirty-seven billion now there's a problem with this - which is that it's assuming that everything is going to stay the same the level of subsidy is going to stay the same Congress is not gonna come along and try and fill in coverage gaps by providing bigger subsidies or bigger tax credits I don't actually believe that the deficit is going to really drop under the spill because there has never yet been a government subsidized program where the deficit decreases it just doesn't happen that way the bill the CBO also says that the that the number of uninsured is going to rise so by 2018 they say 14 million more people would be uninsured than under current law according to the CBO's estimate and they say that most of this 14 million person increase would be people who are currently purchasing health insurance because they are forced to do so by the government and then they would just stop doing it because they don't want to pay the penalty so the left is jumping on this to suggest that people are being thrown off their health insurance no most people just don't want to buy the stupid stuff because it's too expensive and it's crap and once they're not forced to buy it they will stop buying it and we'll talk about this in a little while because the left keeps saying now that this means people are going to die people are going to die because of Trump care no they say that by 2026 fifty two million people would be uninsured according to their estimate and they estimate there will only be twenty eight million people if the status quo of the of the Obama care administration was maintained there is a problem with this however okay so I will explain this problem with this chart here is a this is 18 CBO and this is that this is what the CBO estimated would be the enrollment in Obamacare over time right and so what you can see here if you're if you're watching is you can see several different lines right you can see that there's the CBO's estimate as of 2010 the Seavey's estimate as of 2012 the CBO's estimate as of 2014 and then you have here the CBO's estimate of 2016 and finally have the actual alright then you have the actual so as you can see the actual is much much much lower than what the CBO estimated so they estimated that by this time they estimated that by 2018 if 18 million people would suddenly jump into the Obamacare pool from 12 million that they estimate now and really at only 10 million now originally in 2010 when Obamacare passed they estimated that 22 million people would already have enrolled in Obamacare okay right now it's 10 million people so clearly the CBO doesn't know what it's talking about because you can't forecast these things they were including that the way the CBO estimates these things they take sort of the projections of the administration at issue and they and they carry out their assumptions but if the assumptions are bad assumptions are bad you can see how bad these assumptions are if you want to know what exactly how bad the CBO is at this look at that blue line right look at that blue line and the black line because those are the CBO estimates and then look at that green lines you see the giant disparity between the Green Line and the blue and the blue and black line up top that's how badly the CBO got this wrong on Obamacare and now they're saying that there's gonna be this great discrepancy between Trump care and Obamacare one of the ways that you drive up the gap between what they estimator will be and what Obamacare will be is by following the red line but look the red line still isn't the Green Line see there's this giant gap seven eight million people between what is more likely to happen with the Obamacare exchanges and what is and what the CBO estimates so what the CBO is doing is they're using that red line and then they're contrasting it with what Trump care would do when really they should be using the Green Line and contrasting it with what Trump care would do and that is a much much smaller gap okay the the CBO also says that health insurance companies are not going to survive so despite all of the talk from Trump and team about how this is gonna free up the market it doesn't actually free up the market they say that the market for non group coverage insurance purchased individually would be unstable if the people who wanted to buy coverage in any offered price would have average health care expenditures so high that offering the insurance would be unprofitable in other words without a mandate and this was the reason there was an Obama care mandate without a mandate you don't have healthy people buying in because healthy people don't buy health insurance typically or at least expensive health insurance if you don't have healthy people buying in that drives up the cost of health care for all of the other people who actually are sick because it costs more to insure sick people than to bundle them together with healthy people that means costs go up and people are thrown off their insurance that means the premiums are gonna rise and that's what the CBO estimates they say that the premiums in the individual market will rise before 2020 and then they say that it will decrease after 2020 because a bunch of people will basically be covered by Medicaid expansion up to 2020 and also because they think that they think the competition at that point will kick in and finally you'll see the premiums decrease the problem is 2020 is four years off from now three years off from now there's no guarantee that that happens and then finally the CBO says by the way we don't know what we're talking about here's what the actual report says it says the ways in which federal agency states insurers employers individuals doctors hospitals and other affected parties would respond to the changes made by the legislation our difficult to predict so the estimates in the report are uncertain but everybody's taking it as gospel so number one you shouldn't take it as gospel that's just let's be frank about this the CBO as we show in this chart the CBO really is not correct here and they don't know always what they are talking about it is perfectly fair to question the CBO's forecast based on their history of bad forecasts that's not stopping Democrats from going out there and pointing out that a bunch of people are quote-unquote going to lose their health insurance now I want to start with this premise for one second and pause and when they say that people are gonna lose their health insurance people are gonna die because they lose their health insurance if your only metric of health care success is how many people are covered by any health insurance program whether it sucks whether it's Medicaid then what that means that in the end the only way you're actually going to get to the number you want is through nationalized health care if your only measure of success is how many people are quote-unquote covered and it doesn't matter what the type of coverage is and doesn't matter what the quality of coverage is it doesn't matter everybody whether you can actually get a doctor through the coverage if that's all that matters to you the nationalized health care is the only solution because nationalized healthcare means that everyone's covered sure the health care coverage is crappy sure you can't actually benefit from the health care coverage but everybody is covered and you see the left jumping into this they say that Obamacare is better than Trump care because Obama care quote-unquote covers more people but there's no evidence that that coverage is actually making healthcare outcomes better and there's a reason for that first of all when you don't have health insurance in America it's not like you die on the street very virtually everybody who has a health care problem in the United States walks into an emergency room right as well immigrants do in the state of California overburdening the system so the idea that the alternatives are either have some sort of government provided health insurance or you die in the waiting room it's just not true it's just not true beyond that the vast majority of doctors actually don't accept Medicaid because Medicaid doesn't reimburse at proper rates there are studies that actually examine whether Medicaid increases life expectancy and what they find is basically no so there's something called the Oregon health insurance experiment that actually looked at this in Oregon and it found that it did not decrease ER visits so one of the purposes of having Medicaid is the idea okay you're covered now so you don't have to show up in the ER it actually doubled the number of ER visits because people thought that Medicaid just meant they were supposed to use the ER more apparently and when Medicaid users received more diagnostic which is true it also had no statistically significant effect on several measures of physical health including blood pressure cholesterol or cardiovascular risk so the idea that being on Medicaid is a life saver and if you're not on Medicaid you die it's just not true Jim Garrity at national review he notes that as of 2015 only 2/3 of doctors took Medicaid only 45% of doctors took new patients on Medicaid so a lot of people have been grandfathered in Manhattan Institute says quote the best statistical estimate from the number of lives saved each year by the Affordable Care Act Obamacare is zero certainly there are individuals who have benefited from various of its provisions but attempts to claim broader effects on public health and thousands of lives saved rely upon extrapolation from past studies that focus on the value of private health insurance but the ACA has expanded coverage through Medicaid not private health insurance in fact public health trends since the implementation of Obamacare have worsened because people have lost the private health insurance they've been forced onto Medicaid with 80,000 more deaths in 2015 than had mortality continued declining at during the 2014 2015 rate achieved during 2000 to 2013 in other words the life expectancy in the United States in 2015 under Obamacare actually decreased for the first time in two decades so since 1990 life expectancy has been D has been increasing in the United States it actually dropped last year under Obamacare so suggesting that getting rid of Obamacare will actually kill people no evidence to suggest that's the case at all okay we have to pause here to say hello and thank you to one of our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so right now if your concern

exaggeration and it's not actually true and also the reason that they are saying this is because they are conflating health insurance with health care and by doing so they're basically pushing for nationalized health care because if you say that the only way that America is has a good health care system is if quote-unquote every single person is covered you're gonna end up in a position where you have to cover everybody through the government that's just the way that this works the truth is what you actually want is better health care outcomes on average through choice and there are a lot of ways to do that that don't involve the government one of the reasons that the United States still has high life expectancy is because we developed new products and services one of the reasons we do is because we have a private market understand that what socialism and what redistribution isn't do is they destroy innovation they destroy the capacity of insurance companies to compete with one another for your services and they destroy the capacity for pharmaceutical companies to do research and development for hospitals to do research and development for new drugs to be used for new surgeons to discover new surgeries what socialism does it freezes things in place and passes it around and what capitalism does is it doesn't freeze things in place and pass it around so there's more inequality under capitalism and socialism but it allows innovation it allows prices to drop and that allows more people to have access and that is the important thing now the problem is that the Trump administration has a real divide has a real divide when it comes to how they understand what Trump care ought to be and you can see that and how they are dealing with the CBO report which is really quite fascinating so Donald Trump is basically on the verge of suggesting that we ought to just let Trump care go and let Obamacare implode which as I said yesterday is not a solution because entitlement programs don't implode they just get bigger here is Donald Trump talking about Obamacare and it's imploding and 17 will be the worst view and I said it once I'll say it again because Obama's gun you know he things are gonna be very bad this year for the people with Obamacare they're gonna have tremendous increases and the Republicans frankly are putting themselves in a very bad position I tell this to Tom Price all the time by repealing Obama because people are going to see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare they're not gonna see the devastation in seventeen and eighteen and nineteen it'll be gone by that it'll whether we do it or not it'll be imploded off the map so the press is making it look so wonderful so that if we ended everyone's gonna say oh remember how great Obamacare used to be remember how wonderful it used to be it was so great it's a little bit like President Obama what he left people like them there's actual truth to what Trump is saying here the press is propping up Obamacare talking about how wonderful it's gonna be but the idea that Obamacare is going to implode yes the prices are going to skyrocket at a certain point here because people are dropping off the rolls because people are out they'd rather pay the fines than pay for these high premiums they're dropping on to Medicaid and so they're not really paying into the system all of that's true but that doesn't mean Obamacare is going to implode it just means that the media is going to say more people are covered because they're dropping from private insurance onto Medicaid so that's number one but I think the important gap that you're seeing here is in between Trump and the so-called conservatives who you know like Paul Ryan who really is not super conservative when it comes to this particular bill the gap that you are seeing is that Donald Trump is using the left's metric for what is a successful health insurance and health care program and we'll talk more
