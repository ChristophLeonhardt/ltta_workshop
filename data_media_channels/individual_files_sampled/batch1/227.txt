mr. speaker will you miss it as the Republican leader of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan is second in the line of succession behind the vice president to president Donald Trump Ryan said his decision not to run again was driven by family considerations not unfair that the Democrats might end Republican control of the house when the midterm elections take place in six months time I really don't think a person's race for Congress is gonna hinge on whether Paul Ryan Speaker or not so I really don't think it affects it look if we do our jobs which we are we're gonna be fine as a majority but Ryan is one of forty three Republicans choosing not to run for re-election Democrats need to capture just twenty three seats to regain the house that's the same number of Republican held districts which Trump's Democratic foe Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election and we're already seeing that the GOP is having a difficult time recruiting top-flight candidates to actually run all we have to do is look at what we saw in Alabama and Pennsylvania where they just haven't been able to attract the candidates who can put together both the political and fundraising infrastructure to compete against very seasoned savvy politicians with their chances of a takeover growing some Democrats are already calling for impeaching Trump in expectation that special prosecutor Robert Muller will provide them the ammunition to implicate him or members of his 2016 campaign if Trump follows through on his reported threats to fire mother and his Justice Department superior to spike the investigation that could further doom the Republicans prospects I think they should be allowed to do their jobs we have a rule of law in this country and that's a principle we all uphold I have no reason to believe that that's going to happen I have assurances that's not because I've been talking to people in the White House about it so we'll see what happens but those assurances like many other assessments of the president's intentions may yet prove unreliable Tom Ackerman al Jazeera Washington
