THOSE COLLAPSED POWER WIRES, IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. MY NEXT GUEST IS AMONG THE MANY LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS WHO ARE KEEPING CLOSE TABS ON THE STORM. JOINING ME NOW IS PAM BONDY, ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF HOW BAD THIS WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE TONIGHT? IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE BAD TONIGHT, AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE GUYS OUT THERE IT IS THAT IT LOOKS CLEAR BUT IT'S NOT, THERE IS WATER EVERYWHERE. OUR BRIDGES ARE NOT YET OPEN ESPECIALLY IN THE PANHANDLE. WE HAVE 54 SOLDIERS OPEN WITH PEOPLE IN THEM, GOVERNOR SCOTT IMMEDIATELY ACTIVATED 54 SOLDIERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WITH PAT SO EVERYBODY COULD GET THERE. HE DID HIS BEST TO GET EVERYBODY OUT OF THE PANHANDLE, BUT SO MANY DIDN'T HEED HIS WARNING. NOW THE GOVERNOR IS READY TO GO AND WE HAVE 3500 NATIONAL GUARD NATIONAL GUARD'S READY TO BE DEPLOYED. THEY ARE HELPING SEARCH AND RESCUE, BUT IT'S GETTING DARK AND PEOPLE NEED TO STAY PUT TO STAY SAFE. Martha: THEY WILL HAVE TO HUNKER DOWN AT LEAST ONE MORE NIGHT IN ORDER TO BE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND WAIT UNTIL MORNING. THE WATER IS STARTING TO RECEDE IN THE AREAS BY THE BEACHES, SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF HURRICANE FATIGUE. WE JUST HAD FLORENCE AND THIS ONE COMES BARRELING IN AND IT'S MUCH BIGGER, MUCH STRONGER THAN FLORENCE WAS AND EVEN IN THAT SITUATION THEY WERE TRAGIC DEATHS. DO YOU HAVE ANY UPDATES ON ANY FATALITIES? DO WE KNOW OF ANY AT THIS POINT? SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT LEAVE THEIR HOMES, WITH ALL OF THE COASTLINE LOOKED LIKE AND EVEN TO TAKE YOU FURTHER INLAND WHERE IT TURNED INTO CATEGORY THREE AFTER IT WENT THROUGH TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA, FOR THE CAPITAL IS, HUGE OAK TREES WERE SNAPPING IN HALF, JUST FALLING OVER. IN LEON COUNTY ALONE WHERE THE CAPITAL IS, 167,000 PEOPLE ARE OUT OF POWER. JUST IN LYON COUNTY. YOU'VE HEARD OVER 300,000, BUT ALL THE POWER COMPANIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER. GOVERNOR SCOTT ACTIVATED THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMPACT WHICH IS GREAT. ALL THE UTILITIES, 19,000 UTILITY WORKERS ARE READY TO GO OUT THERE. PEOPLE NEED TO STAY OFF THE STREETS SO THEY CAN GET OUT THERETO AND HELP. SO WHAT'S THE PLAN TONIGHT? OBVIOUSLY, YOU EVERYONE WILL HIT THE ROAD IN THE MORNING BUT WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THIS EVENING? AND FOR THE AREAS IT IS STILL MOVING THROUGH AND STILL VERY STRONG. IT IS. AND WHEN THE DUST STORM SURGES COULD STILL HAPPEN. SEARCH AND RESCUE IS NUMBER ONE. PEOPLE WILL BE OUT THERE, ALL OF OUR GREAT RESCUE WORKERS IN OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, WE CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH IN THIS GREAT STATE. ALL OF OUR SERIFS FROM THE PANHANDLE OF THE WAY DOWN TO CITRUS COUNTY HAVE BEEN TALKING TO ALL OF THEM, AND THEY HAVE DONE AMAZING WORK TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. BUT NOW I AGAIN IT IS SEARCH AND RESCUE, AND THEY RECEIVED A LOT OF CALLS THAT ONCE THE HURRICANE STARTED, THEY COULDN'T GET OUT AND HELP.
