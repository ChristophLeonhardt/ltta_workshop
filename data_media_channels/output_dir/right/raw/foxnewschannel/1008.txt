1
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,493
>> Martha: DEVELOPING TONIGHT,

2
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:11,960
IT APPEARS THAT

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,694
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IS BACK

4
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:13,395
ON THE SCENE.

5
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:14,129
THE FORMER PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY

6
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,064
HAVING SORT OF SECRET MEETINGS,

7
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:16,932
PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT OF HIS

8
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,167
BUILDING WHERE HIS OFFICE IS

9
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,336
NOW, TALKING TO FOLKS WHO MIGHT

10
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,038
BE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS,

11
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:24,072
GIVING SOME ADVICE, SOME

12
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:25,140
GUIDANCE PERHAPS.

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,208
THOUGHTS IN THE FUTURE OF THE

14
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:26,741
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

15
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,610
HE HAS MET WITH AT LEAST NINE

16
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,611
POTENTIAL CANDIDATES SO FAR,

17
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,514
INCLUDING MAJOR NAMES LIKE

18
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:34,316
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN,

19
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:34,983
SENATORS BERNIE SANDERS AND

20
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:36,218
ELIZABETH WARREN AND FORMER

21
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:38,119
MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR DEVAL

22
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,721
PATRICK.

23
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,756
HERE NOW, CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS

24
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:42,491
CONTRIBUTOR, AND JUAN WILLIAMS,

25
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:46,561
COHOST OF THE "THE FIVE."

26
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,129
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

27
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,165
JUAN, LET ME START WITH YOU.

28
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,333
WHAT YOU THINK THIS TELLS US

29
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,868
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE

30
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:54,302
FORMER PRESIDENT AND ALL OF

31
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:54,603
THIS?

32
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:56,137
>> I THINK IN A SENSE HE'S

33
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:56,838
COMING OUT OF HIDING NOW THAT

34
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,807
OBAMA PEOPLE SAY OF COURSE HE'S

35
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:00,342
TALKING TO FELLOW DEMOCRATS, BUT

36
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,843
THE WAY THE NEWS WAS SPREAD

37
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:03,945
TODAY IS THAT THESE ARE

38
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:05,947
POTENTIALLY THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD

39
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:06,581
BE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S

40
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:08,116
NOMINEE IN 2020.

41
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:09,651
I THINK THE KEY HERE IS THAT

42
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:11,553
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT IS OPERATING

43
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:12,721
IN THAT WAY, BUT HE DOESN'T

44
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:15,323
WANTED TO BE THE CASE THAT

45
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:17,125
PEOPLE PERCEIVE THAT THE

46
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:17,826
ESTABLISHMENT, THE DEMOCRATIC

47
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:18,860
PARTY ESTABLISHMENT IS PICKING

48
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,327
THE CANDIDATE.

49
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:21,096
THAT HASN'T WORKED FOR THEM IN

50
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,030
THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES THIS

51
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,965
YEAR LEADING UP TO THE MIDTERMS

52
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:24,699
AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A HEAVY

53
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,635
HAND.

54
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:28,370
THEY PICKED HILLARY CLINTON LAST

55
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,670
TIME.

56
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,038
>> Martha: IS UNDERSTANDABLE

57
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:31,139
THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WOULD

58
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:31,907
WANT TO HAVE THESE MEETINGS SORT

59
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:36,578
OF OFF THE RADAR.

60
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:37,546
I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK OF ALL

61
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,947
THE PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT OF

62
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:39,981
TRUMP TOWER AND HOW DIFFERENT

63
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:40,549
THESE TWO MEN ARE.

64
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:42,551
NOT THAT THE SITUATIONS ARE

65
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:43,285
SIMILAR, BUT EVERYBODY REMEMBER

66
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:45,921
THOSE MOMENTS, THE VIDEO.

67
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:47,322
EVERYBODY WALKING IN AND OUT OF

68
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:48,189
THE BUILDING AND THERE WERE

69
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,225
CAMERAS SET UP EVERYWHERE.

70
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:51,026
VERY DIFFERENT MEN AND HOW THEY

71
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:55,363
GO ABOUT THEIR POLITICS.

72
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:55,797
>> INDEED.

73
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:56,965
TRUMP LIKES A SHOW.

74
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,867
HE LIKES TO DRIED OUT, HE LIKES

75
00:01:58,867 --> 00:01:59,334
THE LIGHTS.

76
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,702
THEY COULD NOT BE MORE

77
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:01,069
DIFFERENT.

78
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,507
BUT WITH BARACK OBAMA, WE HAVE

79
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:10,345
SEEN HIS INVOLVEMENT IN PARTISAN

80
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:11,446
POLITICS SINCE HE LEFT OFFICE.

81
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:12,447
WHETHER HE'S WEIGHING IN ON

82
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:14,482
OBAMACARE OR OTHER POLICY

83
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:18,920
THINGS, BUT IS    AS JUAN SAID,I

84
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,154
THINGS, BUT IS    AS JUAN SAID,T

85
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:23,959
SHOULD BE ALL THAT SURPRISING

86
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:24,626
CONSIDERING THE PRESIDENT IS

87
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:27,228
SITTING THERE WATCHING SO MUCH

88
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,930
OF HIS AGENDA TORN OUT ROOT AND

89
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,898
BRANCH BY THIS PRESIDENT.

90
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:32,334
A LOT OF IT IS EASILY DONE BY

91
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:34,135
WHATEVER IT WAS, THE PEN AND THE

92
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:36,471
PHONE, BECAUSE OF OBAMA'S AGENDA

93
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:38,707
WAS PUT IN BY A PEN AND A PHONE.

94
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:39,307
>> Martha: UNFORTUNATELY

95
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:41,309
THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT PRESIDENT

96
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:42,143
HAVE TO WORK THESE DAYS.

97
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,678
THEY HAVE A TOUGH TIME GETTING

98
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:44,379
THROUGH A LOT OF MAJOR

99
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:44,779
LEGISLATION.

100
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:45,780
I WANT TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE

101
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,682
PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN THERE.

102
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,551
TERRY McAULIFFE, KRISTEN SHALL

103
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,152
A MAN, KEMAL HARRIS.

104
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:52,120
CORY BOOKER HASN'T VISITED THE

105
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,555
OFFER SINCE LAST YEAR.

106
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:54,990
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS

107
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,224
SIGNIFICANT OR NOT, BUT DOES

108
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,826
THIS TELL ANYTHING ABOUT WHO THE

109
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:58,360
PRESIDENT PREFERS?

110
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,328
>> IT'S KIND OF EARLY.

111
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:01,696
I THINK WE'RE STILL TRYING TO

112
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:04,132
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW

113
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:05,567
SIGNIFICANT IT IS THAT HE'S

114
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,735
TALKING TO ALL THESE FOLKS.

115
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:07,736
MANY ARE CONTENDERS BUT THE ONE

116
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,270
THING THAT STANDS OUT TO ME, IF

117
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,538
YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT WHO IS

118
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:11,406
THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC

119
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:15,543
PARTY AT THIS MOMENT AND LOTS OF

120
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,545
PEOPLE, SAYING THERE IS NO

121
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:18,179
LEADERSHIP, THERE'S AN AN

122
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:21,316
ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP.

123
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:23,151
GUESS WHAT, IT'S NOT

124
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:23,918
NANCY PELOSI, IT'S NOT

125
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:24,719
CHUCK SCHUMER.

126
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,387
HERE WE HAVE BARACK OBAMA

127
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,956
ASSERTING HIMSELF AS THE MAN WHO

128
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,324
IS FIGHTING REPUBLICAN

129
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:33,061
GERRYMANDERING, FIGHTING VOTER

130
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:33,795
REGISTRATION AND NOW POTENTIALLY

131
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:35,163
ASSERTING HIMSELF AS THE MAN WHO

132
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,332
WILL SELECT THE PARTY'S NOMINEE.

133
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:38,166
>> Martha: THERE'S NO DOUBT

134
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,834
THAT HIS SUPPORT WILL BE HUGE

135
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,269
FOR WHOEVER ULTIMATELY GETS IT.

136
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,604
BILL CLINTON IS LOOKING LIKE HE

137
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,272
IS JUST DISAPPEARING FROM THE

138
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,206
SCENE AND COMMENTS LIKE THIS ARE

139
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:49,177
NOT GOING TO HELP HIM.

140
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:49,911
>> I THINK THE NORMS HAVE REALLY

141
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:53,948
CHANGED IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CAN

142
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:55,417
DO TO SOMEBODY AGAINST THEIR

143
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:56,685
WILL, HOW MUCH YOU CAN CROWD

144
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:59,988
THEIR SPACE, MAKE THEM

145
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:02,023
MISERABLE.

146
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:02,557
>> WOW.

147
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,025
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S SO GOOD.

148
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,360
>> Martha: HE SAID IT SEVERAL

149
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,960
DAYS AGO.

150
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,162
I HADN'T SEEN THAT UNTIL THIS

151
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,697
MORNING, BUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO

152
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,065
TO SOMEBODY AGAINST THEIR WILL,

153
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:12,367
JUAN?

154
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,134
>> SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO ANYBODY

155
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:15,336
AGAINST THEIR WILL.

156
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:18,473
THERE'S NO CHANGE OVER TIME OR

157
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:19,274
STANDARDS, THAT'S JUST WRONG.

158
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,142
>> Martha: QUICK FUN AND WE'VE

159
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:21,543
GOT TO GO.

160
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:23,511
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

161
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:25,647
THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF

162
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,381
BEHAVIOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE, IN

163
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:31,352
THE OVAL OFFICE THAT A LOT OF

164
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:32,087
QUENTIN'S DETRACTORS DEPLORED

165
00:04:32,087 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT HIM AT THE TIME.
