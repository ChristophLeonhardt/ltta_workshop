the US and many European nations have expelled more than 130 Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a former spy in the UK Russia calls it a provocative gesture is this a sign of another Cold War this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Elizabeth puranam it is the worst diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West since Moscow annexed Crimea four years ago drawing comparisons to the Cold War more than 20 countries European powers as well as the US Canada and Australia have teamed up to expel more than 130 Russian diplomats the u.s. led the way ordering out 60 Russian officials and shutting down the country's consulate in Seattle it is in response to the attack on a former Russian spy in Britain earlier this month EU leaders and the u.s. agree with British officials that it was highly likely that Russian intelligence used a rare military-grade nerve agent to poison Sergey scrapple and his daughter Julia Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations many say the expulsion of a diplomatic victory for the British government this is the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history I have found great solidarity from our friends and partners in the EU North America NATO and Beyond over the past three weeks as we have confronted the aftermath of the Salisbury incident and together we have sent a message that we will not tolerate Russia's continued attempts to flout international law and undermine our values I think you're seeing an increasingly move of bad judgment by Russia and when we see these espionage tactics that are taking place right here at the heart of the UN we can't add that and this is really not just us but multiple countries saying all of these actions have to stop this is not what we do in any other place and it can't be acceptable for you to do this unfortunately Russia is now being held accountable for a lot of things and they have a decision to make they are asking for one than two diplomats while whispering apologies into our ears to leave this or that country we know that this is the result of colossal pressure colossal blackmail which is now unfortunately the main tool of Washington on the international arena while let's bring in our panel now from Moscow Lettie Mae Sot McCarver's director at the Russia east-west Center for Strategic Studies in Berlin tossed and bennett director at the global Public Policy Institute and in Washington DC Graham Bannerman a former US State Department staffer very warm welcome to you all mr. Boehner just how much of a deterioration in relations is this between Russia and the West certainly an escalation in relations what we've seen in the past days of course it's mostly symbolic move it's quite a formidable diplomatic statement on the part of the you that also countries like Italy and Hungary joined those expelling Russian intelligence officer it's also a strong signal visa V the United Kingdom that was attacked on its soil and it's the signal that even posed brexit we want to cooperate on security matters with the United Kingdom and that how regardless of how ridiculous your foreign secretary is that we will stand with the United Kingdom on these matters and mr. pop Sotnikov President Vladimir Putin has said that you know this was unfriendly and provocative but do you think Russia should be surprised at all by this action if it's gotten to assassinate former agents on foreign soil well first of all I would like to say well I very attentively listened to my esteemed colleague from the United States from the former State Department employee so I think that Russia is believing that there is no proof actually there is no actual proof that Russia attacked so so so-called attacked the United Kingdom on its own soil as it was presented by the United Kingdom officials and another thing is that this expulsion of Russian diplomats actually now that huge expulsion since the Cold War era reminds me actually the the Cold War era when they were at it at tit for tat competition I don't think that Russia actually somehow involved in this horrible act of killing the former former former spy former Russian spy think there were some other agencies which were involved in this if it wasn't Russia mister Sotnikov which of course all of these other countries that have expelled Russian diplomats believe it is who would be responsible you you if I understood you right who will be responsible for for what for for for expulsion Russian diplomats or the assassination of Sergei or knowledge or it's isn't Russia who is behind it it that isn't Russia actually definite that this is a provocation I think that most probably there could be a joint action on behalf of some Secret Service's worse than Secret Service's unnamed I don't know whether it's mi5 for mi6 or probably together this is joint operation between the mi5 mi6 and CIA I don't know but they this is really a provocation actually right for now we will have to take the British government at their word like many other countries have including the u.s. mr. Bannerman what about America's action here is it a significant toughening of the u.s. stance towards Russia oh it's clearly a very significant tactic because it's it's unprecedented in the size and of expulsion of of Russian diplomats from the United States you have the 48 in Washington and twelve in New York and then they're gonna close the consulate in Seattle but it's meant to be a clear signal to Russia I think that there are certain behaviors that are unacceptable one is the action in the UK for us in the United States there's also the interference in our elections those two issues have caused a great strain in the relationship and I think this was and it meant to be a gesture to Russia say this is a very serious problem we need a relationship with Russia we need we don't want to go back to the Cold War there's certain behaviors that cross lines and is that message being said with one voice do you think as the US administration speaking with one voice on this issue because although we have seen this great number of diplomats excelled we did have president Trump speak with President Putin on the phone just days ago and he didn't even bring up the Sergey scribble case and went against advice and even congratulated him on his election victory like he did on Twitter I think this is actually a sign of that President Trump has a a great deal more subtlety in his thinking on some of these issues than than most of us thought he did I think he sees the relationship with Russia on many levels and many tears and and so he's cleaning a clear signal with the conversation with President Putin he says we want to have a relationship for you we need to work with you there are issues we have to do with but on the other hand there are unacceptable behavior that you're doing including the events in UK and the interfering iron in our elections I think it's it's a much subtler approach than the United States has had towards Russia in many years it's very interesting mr. Bennett if that is where the u.s. stands what about the European Union because we've had the European Council President Donald Tusk saying that there could be more measures in the coming days I mean you're saying that the expulsion that we've seen so far as great as it is is symbolic could this get worse I mean the the question the Europeans need to ask themselves what are measures that would really send a strong signal to mr. Putin or whoever in in his system authorized this this attack on mr. creeper that would really hurt them this expulsion is a symbolic move but it just triggers tit for tat the Russians clearly have fun expelling the same number of diplomats and responding in kind but there are a number of measures Europe and the US could take where Russia couldn't respond in town in kind the first measure would be to go after all the Russian oligarchic money that's in Western financial capitals chiefly London and also to restrict the freedom of movement and maneuver of Putin's cronies in London that would hurt to a degree the UK itself because they would need to go after the money but that would be something where mr. Putin couldn't respond in can't because there's no Western money hiding hiding in in London the second measure would to expose the truth about the way mr. Putin covers Western intelligence services are sure to have a great deal of information on mr. Putin's corruption and other details of his system of governance and this truth should be exposed and the only way the Russians system and regime can respond is with the kind of conspiracy theories of and lies that we've also heard from our Russian guests just now so go after the money and expose the truth these this would be unique measures Western countries could take where Russia couldn't respond in kind mr. Sotnikov what do you make of those possible measures that could and according to mr. Boehner should be imposed on Russia how worried would it be about those well actually I think that Russia as it has its own national policy independent of foreign policy would retaliate in to a great extent I think Russia should actually expand expel the same number of Western diplomats because this is really an unprecedented unprecedented affair in the history of recent diplomatic relations between Russia and the Western powers because the level of relations between Russia and the Western powers especially with the US and of course with the UK is very very low so Russia should retaliate retaliation is not a proper what actually evidence should should should answer by the same measure this is that should be a mere Oh answer and it will be justified in terms that Russia should be showing to the world that Russia should be considered as an responsive power and the expulsion czar expected but as mr. Boehner was saying that there are measures that European powers can take that Russia could not actually match like the great flow of Russian money from Kremlin connected oligarchs that goes into real estate in London you know what that would Hertz very powerful people in Russia but what is the proof what is the proof of this as you say is he put it flowing money from Russia to the West and as my esteemed American colleague said corruption is as and he actually mentioned in Putin regime so what are what are the proofs because the proofs are just generated in the Western press and they're generated among special services so no no actual proof actually but we were presented to the Russian people the only way we can say and we can we can here that some agency some some political analysts in the West is saying about that but what bothers day the we need we need the complete and whole truth about that and proof mr. Benner would you like to come back on that I think there is proof that has already been produced and I think the intelligence services and other relevant authorities can certainly divulge more information on this and doing so would send a strong signal to mr. Putin to stop these kind of provocations the same way kind of the deployment of troops on NATO's eastern flank has signaled to mr. Putin that he should stop territorial aggression and should not even dare to target NATO countries that being said we need to start a sent a strong signal but then also we need to minimize the time we spent on mr. Putin's Russia which is our neighbor it's also a country that's mightily annoying right now the way it does politics with Europe but it's not a competitive threat to Europe the power holders in in Beijing are very happy that the Western elites are focusing mostly on on Russia these days which is as I said not a competitive challenge and not spending enough time on the challenges for example that China's authoritarian state capitalism that is incredibly competitive with with the Western model also on economic terms poses poses to the West and so we should stand a strong signal but also try to mininum the time we spend on Russia because Russia shouldn't become that kind of obsession in Europe that it has become in some circles in Washington and mr. bannerman is has it become something of an obsession as mr. Boehner says in some circles because Russia is behaving in a way that it that it hasn't maybe in the last 10 or 15 years where it's not just interfering in countries that it sees in its sphere of interest or influence you know that are closer to Russia but they're actually interfering in domestic processes in Western European countries in America too and in a way that we haven't seen more recently well I think there's no question that there are large elements within the Western population in the United States and in Western Europe that believe that we're moving very much towards a confrontational relationship with Russia and I think that would be unfortunate I think it's the same sort of mirror image in in Russia also of people who want a confrontation I don't think that's in the interest of anybody involved I think it's necessary to make clear demonstrations when Russia steps beyond the acceptable bounds of international relations interfering in American elections what happened in the UK but there are also a whole range of issues with Russia as a a great country an important country a significant international actor that we all have to act with Russia and the West and I think balancing those two things is going to be very difficult because you're gonna have domestic pressures in both societies to take this to an extreme which would be very harmful to all involved over the long run well mr. mr. Sultan the call one of the many issues that Russia is very involved in of course that needs resolution is Ukraine do you think that this latest action that we've seen these expulsion could have an impact on resolving the situation there do you think they could make mr. Putin more reluctant to say deal with these countries in finding a solution or maybe more willing because of the international pressure well first of all let me ask questions from my esteemed Western colleagues from from their lane and from the Washington DC so only was saying true to send a strong signal instruct signal to Russia what a further deter area the deterioration of the relationship what who will gain from that but this is a question whether they would like to answer it or not later on but regarding your question actually I think that despite all this tête-à-tête confrontation I mean the despite the expansion of diplomats my prediction is that the negotiations with the crane will continue and believe me Russia has no any interest of conquering Ukraine or just to prolong the situation to prolong to have to have the Ukrainian crisis prolonged because it actually affects the relationship of Russia with Ukrainian people because we have to throw strong ties strong keen ties between Russians and Ukrainians so I think that mr. Putin will actually continue to with the peace process in Ukraine and that was he will be calling West to do the same and just to ask Ukrainian authorities to be reasonable and to continue the process of peaceful negotiations and peaceful settlement of this acute Ukrainian crisis mr. banner I could see you wanting to come and earlier there no just to answer this question this deterioration of relations with mr. Putin's Russia is not in the Western interest but it is in the Western interest to send a strong signal that actions such as the one once taken in the UK or the war crimes committed in Syria for that for for that matter that those or the aggression aggression is in Ukraine that needs to stop and then the the West is not pursuing these measures to have a cold war with Russia nobody wants this this is not in our interest as I said we should actually be focusing much more on the competitive threat that's that's coming from China and and elsewhere and not on on mr. Putin's Russia which which is a security competitor but not an economic competitor with with the West and actually we're driving by having this confrontation with Russia we risk driving mr. Putin's Russia much closer to China then it would naturally be in in the state of affairs so sending a strong signal but then also being open to in case the Kremlin decides to stop the aggressive acts and come to mother to a more cooperative relationship based on on international law and mutually agreed terms mr. Sotnikov how long do you think Russia can withstand this sort of international what looks like isolation now and pressure because Russia is of course it's not the Soviet Union you know it has important relations with the EU important economic relations with the EU it is much more integrated into the world economy you know more than the USSR was it's already hurting of course because of sanctions due to its actions in Ukraine like how much more pressure can it withstand or does it have their appetite for well let me let me let me tell you first of all that Russia has been already withstanding this mounting pressure from above Western partners since the year of 2014 since the joining Ukraine into the composition of a Russian Federation so and while Russia will sustain will sustain this crisis yes sanctions are taking toll yeah I agree but not to extend that Russia will collapse and another thing which I would like to ask my Western colleagues you are saying Putin's Russia Putin's regime and everything like that so but just recent elections showed that more than two-thirds of Russian population including myself voted for the president to be Vladimir Putin so which Russia they would like to deal with in the future without Putin or with with someone else this is this system in all sense mr. bannerman how do you think that the u.s. is going to deal is they put in say Putin's Russia or the the Kremlin I I say Putin's Russia or the Kremlin for the very same for the very reason that this is not directed against Russian citizens and Russian people there are not enemies and enemies of the West it's their government that chose this confrontation with the West but we need to kind of keep the lines open especially with with Russian citizens and you mentioned the elections I mean these were not free and fair elections I realized that mr. Putin also based on his propaganda machine has a great deal of support apparently within within the Russian population but then why disqualify one candidate by turning him into a pseudo criminal and not allowing him to run that's mr. Novotny and another potential challenger was assassinated the year before so we cannot speak of fair and fair and free elections and there's not an open information environment and in Russia mr. panner but we are we're not talking about the Kremlin were free I'd like to bring mr. bannerman and now because mr. Benner was talking about you know a more nuanced way of of dealing with Russia which is what you were saying that the US administration that the president Donald Trump has been you know more subtle in dealing with this than he has been in the past so what will the US administration do now do you think beyond these expulsion is there any way to to move forward here I I think many of us in the United States were surprised that President Trump has a more subtle approach to these issues than we originally thought of him because these his public statements are often in conflict from his actions but I think what's important is President Putin is the leader of Russia countries deal with country countries and therefore we have to deal with President Putin and the Russian government we're not we're not going to deal with the people we prefer to live with it within Russia Russia is an important player on many many issues that are important to the Western countries and to the United States and specifically for example in the Middle East we can't there's no solution to Syria unless the Russians are fully involved they've taken the lead they're playing an important role but everybody needs to help to solve that problem the Iranian problem the aggression of Iran in the region is a serious concern to many people Russia has to be a partner in solving that the Ukraine obviously cannot be solved without Russian participation therefore we do not want to see the relationship on extraneous issues and break down our ability to work with Russia to solve major international issues that are vital to the national interests of the world mr. Sotnikov do you think that Russia feels now would this action that's been taken that this is a turning of the tide that they are dealing now with a more united West and are they going to be more cooperative do you think I don't think that you mentioned the phrase more United to us tonight at West on which issue on ratio of exponents but look if you have some small countries like Poland Greece or so they expelled for one diplomat and one diplomat will be soon exchanged for for for another diplomat coming to this country but this is not you United to my mind this is not the United position this is just using the pretext the the the the the the very dubious pretext of killing the ex-spy scruple - to unite - to - to unite ranks of Western powers but alright I would like to ask a question to my from from from from my colleagues yeah just just small question what do you think how Russia will be dealing with the Western countries in the future despite all these sanctions despite all this pressure and everything mr. Boehner you have 30 seconds to respond to that question I hope that mr. Putin's government will decide to deal with the West in a responsible and cooperative manner eventually as I said it's not in the West's interest to have a confrontation with Russia nobody gains from from that in the West the Russian regime right now is a major nuisance but it's not a competitive economic threat and we hope that we come back to a relationship that is responsible and very cooperative but that presupposes cooperative and responsible behavior on the part of the the Kremlin mr.
