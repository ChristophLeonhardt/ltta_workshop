this won't be the first time that I'll
give it all I've got a promise I don't
mean for everything's turned our room
lot of complex purse and one me up and
watch me gun you'll always be second to
my love for the young it's late and your
nose is turning red from the boom a
feets are walking with me crumpling the
snow and I got myself a question
when it gets to midnight will you take
my freezing hands
you
it's
for me but you can still be free if you
leave now
but my
I'm a sucker for stability
which might come as a surprise but I
can't help but love the way you smile to
one side wait I need the music to remind
a small wave losses
I can granny
on the frost another dark is all around
us before the full moon in the sky
ones in love and I
can say my breath in front
dancing in the air with yo
honkers we're so unsure
for me the
you can still be free if you leave now
chocolate bye
you
