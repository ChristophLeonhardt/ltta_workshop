fact the British police array named two Russian nationals as chief suspects in the navi truck poisoning case in the UK Theresa May the British prime minister not long ago also said that those two work for Russian military intelligence so let's get their thoughts now have any mahjong cheese with it as you can see behind me a former mi5 officer and he thanks for coming on let's just firstly listen then to what was said by Theresa made just a few moments ago based on a body of intelligence the government has concluded that the two individuals named by the police and CPS are officers from the Russian military intelligence service also known as the GRU the GRU is a highly disciplined organization with a well-established chain of command so this was not a rogue operation it was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian stage what do you make of that statement Annie well certainly extremely interesting partly in timing because I said right as this story began to break last March that it would take the police months to pull together a case and yet within about a couple of days to reason may at that point stood up in Parliament made various allegations against the Russian state even then absent evidence even before she called in the OPCW to investigate which she was legally bound to do to do and also refusing to allow the Russian state a part in the investigation which again under the chemical weapons treaty they are legally required to do so she's broken rules every which way now in this case are the findings of the police fortuitously came out on the same day as the first Parliament Prime Minister's question time in Parliament where suddenly we have the PM magnifying and expanding on what was actually put in the CP the criminal prosecution report under parliamentary privilege so she can throw information around as much as she wants it's um it's very concerning and I think one key point around this is that it will never come to court because under the Russian Constitution Russian nationals cannot be extradited so what this is effectively is a sort of trial by media putting in bits of evidence that you know look pretty compelling but will be never tested in a real court of law the Americans have done this too with Robert Mueller throwing around all sorts of accusations against Russian nationals providing great color and great detail in what are called speaking indictments so it's not just the basic charges these individuals would face it's putting in color and added information to make it look in public as if there is guilt but without again having the opportunity to have it tested in a court of law and that's what I think is going on in the UK - if you look at the evidence that was provided by the British police assuming that these are GRU officers this is surprised you the way they behaved and perhaps the way they tried to dispose of the material did it look like a professional job not so much from what I've seen so far no there's also confusing statements around exactly what Charlie Roley the boyfriend of Don Sturgis the the woman who sadly died what he actually found I mean he made her an interview for television and he said very clearly that he found a sealed box of what he thought was sent and it was sealed with even the cellophane wrapping still around the box and he said very clearly he had to remember to open it with a knife to slice the cellophane when he gave it to his girlfriend so on the one hand the police are trying to say oh well these two amateur yet very professional GRU officers just dumped the scent bottle they were using to try and kill the scribbles on the other hand the person who found this dumped another chalk agent in a scent bottle said it was a sealed scent box so you know the evidence doesn't stack up between the two versions of the story and we didn't really hear much new evidence did we from Teresa Mary despite making that stunning statement she came back to the sort of thing we've heard before Russia is the only country with the technical means or the operational know-how or the motive and we know that that probably isn't the case you know you can argue a case against those three points - absolutely and many of us have been doing so ever since this story broke I've been saying right from the start that the motive is opaque that is more likely to be in what sergey skripnikov being released from russia and nobody seems to be looking into that in fact there are censorship notices D notices hedged around what could be key information particularly around his mi6 handler Pablo Miller so we don't really know what the motive could be to this day and I think you know but it's we're never going to get to the bottom of this because it won't be tested in a court of law what I would suggest is that the British government should order a proper public inquiry to try and find out exactly what might have happened none of the information has stacked up to date but it has been used with amazing speed and amazing facility to point the finger at the Russian state and one final point I would make unless well is you know even if it were finally proven to have been GRU officers there's a high probability that it could indeed be rogue even though Theresa May said it wasn't how would she know what the the thinking is within the GRU and this isn't something that would be confined just to Russia at the Russian state I mean the British intelligence agencies the American intelligence agencies carry out operations without the required oversight and permission from their notional political masters - so you know all of these different variations all these variables are thrown into the mix of what remains a very opaque case Anna you just finally I know also Teresa may wrapped up by saying that this fits a pattern of Russian behavior - and she sort of wheeled out the argument she's wheeling out a few months ago but again it doesn't really add to in any sort of real convincing way extra information that would make you think oh goodness yes it's clear that Russia did it I was just left feeling well this is everything you've said before the only extra bit we now we have is that British intelligence officers without explaining exactly how believe that these work for the GRU that's the only extra bit but again you know where's the transparency how do we know that that is actually correct absolutely and we probably never will if it's the assertions of the intelligence agencies and that is the problem as I said before I think we need to try and find what the motive could be and again I've said right from the start of this story I can't see what the motive would be for a rush state sanctioned hit on a former officer of the GRU who betrayed his country was caught imprisoned released under pardon and swapped in the 2010 spy swap with the American spy circle so if they'd wanted to to penalize him more heavily they could have done it before they released him so it doesn't make sense that they would try and carry out a hit in the country that was trying to provide him with protection and asylum unless they wanted to prove perhaps that mi6 whose duty of care he was actually can't protect their agents when they they have them in safe haven in the UK which is rather embarrassing thing for them to have to admit beyond that though the motive is not clear and that's why I keep saying as well we need to look at what work he might have been involved in either with mi6 or corporations or businesses over the last eight years since he's been given asylum in Britain and I think that's where the motive can be and it could well be that there are other countries we know certainly that they have the facility to make novel not least Iran and also the Czech Republic has said it can but also I'm sure that organised criminals can get their hands on this sort of weapon - it wouldn't be that difficult especially from some of the former Soviet countries they're now independent which did develop these sort of nava chocks as well before the dissolution of the Soviet Union so there's all sorts of players out there and until they can provide some more convincing evidence than just a couple of CCTV pictures from the London Transport system I think you know everyone she keeps still a very open mind and not rushing to a stampede of yet more diplomatic measures yet more sanctions against Russia nothing has been proven in a court of law okay Annie really good to talk to you appreciate your time this afternoon that's Annie marchionne former mi5 intelligence officer thank you you
