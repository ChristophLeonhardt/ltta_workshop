1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,970
North Korea’s
propaganda machine

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,270
is famously enormous and enduring.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,370
It’s primarily used
inside the country

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,530
to bolster the Kim dynasty’s
cult of personality.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,309
But with North Korea
taking the Olympic stage,

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,790
it is finding a wider
audience internationally.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,220
North Korea
is sending 22 athletes

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,690
to the Games and a
230-member cheering squad.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,410
The women, sometimes referred
to as Kim Jong-un’s

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,659
army of beauties, have arrived
in South Korea in what many

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,390
are calling Kim’s
Olympic charm offensive.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,840
The cheerleaders are chosen
by strict criteria on height

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,040
and family background,

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,160
according to reports
from a defector.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,060
They often wear traditional
Korean garb and use flags

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,870
and fans in routines.

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,730
They have also sported more modern,
worldly looks, including

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,130
Nike baseball caps and T-shirts.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,130
The Olympics will be the
first global appearance

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,470
for the cheerleaders,
but it is their fourth time

21
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,360
traveling to the South.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,430
They made their
debut there in 2002

23
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,380
at the Asian Games in Busan.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,250
They appeared again at the 2003
Summer Universiade in Daegu.

25
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,980
Their last trip to the South
was in 2005,

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,180
for the Asian Athletics Championships.

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,440
Ri Sol-ju was one of the
cheerleaders at the time —

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,090
before she got married.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,220
The cheerleaders’ participation
at the Olympics

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,320
is a rare display

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,110
from a reclusive country
and will undoubtedly

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:00:00,000
be closely watched.
