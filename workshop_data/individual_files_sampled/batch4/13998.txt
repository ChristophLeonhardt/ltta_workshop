christine ford testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party that she attended 35 or 36 years ago with maybe five or maybe six or maybe seven people where Brett Kavanaugh attempted to grope her or maybe rape her or maybe murder her in a room with one other boy or maybe three other boys or well we'll analyze dr. Ford's changing story and her uncredible testimony then miracle of miracles Lindsey Graham becomes the GOP is the most courageous senator and finally I will go through the mailbag that I didn't get to yesterday I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show what a buff of a testimony yesterday what a buff of a hearing what a buff of a process for the United States Senate and for confirming judges it was a mockery was disgraceful every Democrat should be taken out back and smacked around a little bit for what they did to our republic and what they did to our constitutional order yesterday was disgusting we learned a lot from it though we learned that Ford is not believable she's not believable I'm not saying she gave horrible testimony I'm not saying that you know she totally broke down her testimony was fine it probably the people who want to believe what she says is true probably believe it still and the people who are skeptical saw all of the inconsistencies and contradictions in her testimony they saw all of the times their lawyer leaned in and said don't don't answer that no don't don't answer about how Dianne Feinstein referred lawyers to you oh don't answer about the advice you're getting from political operatives oh don't answer about why you didn't do basic things and she also apparently misrepresented what her polygraph was we saw contradictions between her testimony on that polygraph and the letter she wrote to Dianne Feinstein it just broke down it just wasn't believable and Kavanaugh was believable and it's as simple as that and anybody telling you oh you know there but no who knows and this and that no her testimony was not believable his was I actually I have this relative I won't say which relative of mine this is because I don't want to ruin her career in her life by just association with me but she texted me yesterday and she said I she is left of Lenin I mean she is she is as far left as anybody that I know certainly anybody in my family she texted me and said I think Cavanaugh is being falsely accused and I said well if you're saying it then it's certainly true and that's the impression you get his testimony was very powerful it was hard to watch it was hard to watch because it was pretty emotional he couldn't keep the emotion back he was very credible and she I don't know if she's a crazy person or if she's miss remembering something she's clearly a damaged individual just from not only from her behavior but the various the various therapies that we're talking about that she where all of this came from apparently so we'll talk about all of that his/her behavior was pretty weird I should note I had a great time last night I mean I'm you might notice I'm not in the studio right now I'm still in Pittsburgh we had a great time at Franciscan University of Steubenville the students were incredible super super smart I I really shouldn't recommend this university to you because then a bunch of like yet the word is gonna get out a bunch of lefties are gonna go in you know they're gonna ruin the whole place but it was incredible it's really really impressed with very serious kids super smart well-educated so it was great great to hang out with them we talked about the simple joys of being right we're in a more speeches coming up on mic khofifah and campus tour with Yap we're gonna be going on October 24th and 25th to Grand Canyon University and I think we're going to Michigan after that though I could be mistaken but they're coming up so if you want me to come to your school get your request in through yeah because we're filling up fast so if you didn't watch the testimony yesterday if you don't watch the hearings lucky you oh man this was really I mean during my show I was watching the testimony while I was supposed to be writing my speech I was watching the testimony it was all drama you want to be entertained you got entertained it was really hard to watch if you missed it you you can watch about 10 seconds of the testimony you'll understand what the whole thing was here is Brett Kavanaugh federal judge DC Circuit Judge Supreme Court nominee being grilled on the meaning of the word book from his 1982 high school yearbook have you I don't know if it's buffed or boofed how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we were 16 okay that was from Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon White has a pure hack a pure partisan they all have been in this I sort of give Kamala Harris and Cory Booker a little bit of leeway because they're running for president and it's still cheap and shallow but at least there's a purpose to it but dick Blumenthal a dick durbin Sheldon Whitehouse they're behaving like monsters I mean they're behaving like hysterical little monsters it's awful it makes a mockery of our process and so yesterday after all of these hearings Sheldon Whitehouse leans in he goes I want to ask you more about your high school yearbook from 1982 and Kavanaugh basically says yeah go right ahead okay the United States Senate Judiciary Committee Supreme Court nominee okay let's talk about my yearbook you know and so then you know what's the meaning of the word buh and Kavanaugh just knocks it out of the park and it this highlights it they're asking about these little trio did you ever have beer in high school yes senator I would I I was a high school student yeah back when the drinking age was eighteen actually so it's even more defensible did you ever drink when you were a young man yeah because on account if I was a young man so yes I did idiots the way you know that this was a really serious hearing other than Democrats asking about how many times brick have enough flagellated when he was sixteen the other way you know is a really serious hearing is that they had Alyssa Milano there that's they had Alyssa Milano she brought in as a guest of Feinstein or somebody and she's sitting there behind Kavanagh I don't mmm like that's a really that's a serious person a really serious senator is invites Alyssa Milano to the testimony absolutely outrageous in the way that they all I mean it was so awful Chuck Grassley deserves a lot of blame here this never should have happened it never should have been brought to this they they were so nice everybody on the committee was so nice to Christine Ford and they were so hostile and so unfair and so outrageous to Brit cabin on I had an Coulter on my show a couple days ago a few days ago and I asked her about dr. Ford and and in her typical you know subdued staid way said that she was obviously a lefty lunatic nutcase out of her mind and I I thought that was a little unfair at the time not quite so sure now after that testimony here is how all of the senators here the hard questions that they gave to dr. Ford making these allegations trying to ruin a man's life keep them off the Supreme Court take a fair judicial pick away from a sitting president duly elected president here the here's the tough way that they grilled her you know you are not on chocolate you are not on trial you are sitting here before members of the United States Senate's Judiciary Committee because you had the courage to come forward because as you have said you believe it was your civic duty she most certainly is on trial she this was the line they all repeated this because they all wanted to get their little clip for their campaign ad so they said and you I just want you to know you're not on trial you're not under you are on trial she dr. Ford is on trial she is making a really serious outrageous allegation from something that allegedly happened 36 years ago an outrageous I mean she's she's calling him a rapist and a murderer now obviously the thing she describes was he groped her but she's saying he tried to rape me he tried to murder me I thought he was gonna kill me accidentally whatever you're on trial your credibility is on trial here and it needs to be seriously scrutinized but the Democrats have done away with due process they've done away with the rights of the accused they're tweeting I believe all women why would you believe all women do is there something about those double X chromosomes that makes you incapable of lying what are you talking about they say why would a woman lie I don't know I couldn't tell you but we're through several cases just a few days ago I meant more than several cases of major rape allegations that turned out to be hoaxes the biggest rape cases in recent history the two biggest rape cases were major hoaxes maybe the three Tawana Brawley in the 80s which al Sharpton made his career on the Duke Lacrosse case obviously ruined those kids lives and the UVA case the UVA is another example this was a major news story published in Rolling Stone it was a lie I don't know why would people make up false allegations psychosis revenge politics convenience I don't know it happens a lot though and and some you just couldn't explain why so I don't know but they say I believe you why why what evidence is she presented she's contradicted herself and we'll get to those examples in a second so but the Democrats had to try to pick a lane here because they tried to do two things at once and it did not work the one that the first tactic was to say doctor for she's doctor for it she's not mrs. Ford she's doctor she has a PhD she's a psychologist she okay she's a clinical psychologist doctor doctor for serious academic published a lot of things here's Feinstein going that path at the start of the hearings I have to say when I saw your CV I was extremely impressed you have a bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill two masters degrees one from Stanford and one from Pepperdine and a PhD from the University of Southern California better known to senator Harris and I as USC you are a professor affiliated with both Stanford University and Palo Alto University you have published over 65 peer-reviewed articles and have received numerous awards for your work and research and therefore you're telling the truth in relating the truth correctly about an allegation that happened 36 years ago that no one has ever heard of until five seconds ago because you know you you go to Palo Alto University or whatever by the way I don't remember them introducing brick cabin all this way I'm pretty impressed with Brett Kavanaugh SCV Yale undergrad Yale Law School clerked for the Supreme Court feted staff secretary to the president worked on the Ken Starr investigation which is what a lot of this is about because the Clinton world is getting revenge and Democrats are getting revenge for that whole episode and they're trying to flip it on a sex issue then what federal judge then you know he's on one of the most powerful courts in the country DC Circuit Court of Appeals and now a Supreme Court nominee that's a pretty good CV I don't remember them to all but she attends Palo Alto University or she's affiliated with Palo Alto okay Wow incredible so the reason they did that is because they want to say that she's this serious person look she's a professor okay how their and no no crazy people ever become professors right no like we don't have an entire character trope in popular culture of the wacky crazy professor pie-in-the-sky politicized whatever no she's a professor of Palo Alto University she couldn't be lying so they go down that path they want to say she's a super serious person but then they realized they have to make her really likeable and sweet and innocent and cute so they're trying to do two things at once and it doesn't quite work when I heard at the top of these heroes one of the first things Christine for had said made me really question what was going on here here's right at the top of her hearings when they introduced her I want to say that to everybody that she has asked for anytime you asked for a break you get a break anytime there's something that you need you don't have just ask us and you can have as much time for your opening statement as you want and and just generally let us know if there's any issues proceed please Thank You senator Grassley I think after I read my opening statement I anticipate meeting some caffeine if that is available okay oh we should I just anticipate well if you anticipated it then bring a cup of coffee to the hearing you anticipated you anticipated or have a have a shot of espresso before you sit down no I just might need some caffeine I might need a break after this if you guys start grilling me I don't want to answer those questions hee hee hee I'm so cute they're trying to play it both ways and by the way so we should be very blunt about this because there's the question of this political disgusting disgraceful circus where they rip down a good man who's never had any of these allegations laid against him until he was in the position to swing the court to be more a right-wing to be more originalist they asked why didn't this happen with Neil Gorsuch Neil Gorsuch was replacing Antonin Scalia it's hard to get more hardcore and originalist than Scalia so it doesn't change the makeup of the court Brett Kavanaugh is replacing Anthony Kennedy Kennedy is the swing vote Kennedy was the squish Brett Kavanaugh appears to be more Rock ribs than him this will fundamentally change the composition of the court and they're out for blood this is largely about Democrats abortion lust this is largely about how insistent they are that we preserve the fictitious constitutional right to kill a baby in the womb but that's why they're reacting this way to Cavanaugh instead of or such and every lefty who's bringing up that comparison knows it every major lefty every lefty analyst or elected official and they're just being obtuse but as to the matter did Brett Kavanaugh grope this girl super drunk in 1982 or whenever we have no reason to believe that that's true everyone who has been called on is a witness to the event or around the time has said this isn't true or I don't remember right never met Brett Kavanaugh they including the girl that she says was there so but but also I don't care I actually don't care what happened to 1982 I feel bad for her if something happened in 1982 I wish he'd told someone sooner so whatever guy was being aggressive with her could have been punished for it but I don't care I know nobody cares by the way nobody could not a single person on that Judiciary Committee cares not a single Democrat who's demagoguing cares they are just making an issue out of this to keep an originalist off of the court but she says it's her civic duty she says it's it's her civic duty to come here and stop this guy from being on the Supreme Court cuz he'll have too much power where was she when he made it to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals one of the most powerful courts in the country where was she then was it that's one of the most powerful courts in the country if she thought that this was so important to keep him off the Supreme Court why wouldn't you keep him off the DC Circuit is she in that that Court in many ways has more patsies more cases right thank you no we see the big headline or banner cases make it up to the Supreme Court but most cases don't make it up to the Supreme Court if it was your civic duty why not stop him then doesn't doesn't add up but it's certainly been demagogued by Democrats so they they try to play the cutesy thing she's either the super serious sober academic or she's really really cutesy and they should have picked Elaine because I don't think it played very well but then she she makes one of the most stunning statements of the day I'll let her speak for herself we're here to accommodate you now and I'm used to being collegial go ahead oh you're used to being cool I'm used to being collegial that's why I'm gonna burn down a man's life over 36 year old allegations that are refuted by every one that I occasionally say were there even though I changed the number of people who were there left and right but I'm collegial I'm collegial I'm gonna burn I'm gonna I'm going to take away from a duly elected president his right his constitutional right to put a judge on the court I'm gonna take that away because I'm collegial he and Chuck Grassley for his part the whole time go and we can get you in would you like a back rub would you like how that is the lighting in the room okay give me a break so pathetic thank goodness we have Lindsey Graham to be the spine of the GOP we'll get to him in a second but outrageous a brazen statement I'm you I'm used to being collegial not collegial at all this is horrific what's happening and if you look if something happened if you've got evidence that something happened bring the evidence okay bring it but you don't have any evidence and actually the corroborating people say it didn't happen so then she gets into the meat of her accusation here it is I believed he was going to rape me I tried to yell for help when I did Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling this is what terrified me the most and this had the most lasting impact on my life it was hard for me to breathe and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me so what is the allegation now the allegation first was that he groped her he was super drunk and he tried to get her shirt off and he you know was kind of grabbing her on a bed then the allegation was he tried to rape me nothing she's described suggests he's tried to rape her or raped her then she says he was going to kill me what what are you talking about this is why the Senators brought up yesterday well it's tell your truth Cory Booker said Brett tell your truth your truth we hear the left say this all the time not the truth your truth the reason they say this is because they know that the objective facts they can't stand on them at all they had it totally knocks him down so it has to be all about subjective feeling did he grope you or did he murder to try to murder you which was it well I felt I felt he was gonna murder me I thought he was gonna go slaughter my whole family maybe go commit genocide somewhere I thought I pretty sure I just felt because I felt and I believed that 36 years ago this guy was going to commit genocide prove me wrong that's what I felt that's my truth that's my truth so it went on like that there is no evidence that Brett Kavanaugh did anything to Christine Ford in 1982 or at any other time the only suggestion that he did that comes from Christine Ford whose testimony has a lot of holes in it an end end is uncredible just by virtue of the fact that it's only coming up now five seconds before this guy is going to make it to the Supreme Court with a political agenda during a particularly heated moment when the Supreme Court has a lot of power and the left is totally ginned up against President Trump there are a lot of contradictions in this testimony let's just go through them very quickly John Nolte put up a good piece on this this morning in the letter to Feinstein she says that there were five people at the party me and four others then in the statement that she passed her polygraph test on we'll get to that polygraph in just one second she said it was four boys and a couple of girls which means that at the minimum there were six people there and possibly seven people there because in the first one she said me and four others and she says four boys a couple of girls she including herself and a couple of girls even if she is it still contradicts her letter to Dianne Feinstein possibly certainly by one person maybe by two people then there's the matter of the therapists notes in the therapists notes from this session that she apparently had in 2012 30 years after the alleged event happened and six years ago she said that there were four people in the room during the attempted rape then when she spoke to The Washington Post she said that there were two people in the room during the attempted rape or the murder of the groping or whatever it was in at any given point in her testimony then she says she had a fear of flying so this was the reason that she couldn't come testify in DC and the Judiciary Committee offered to fly to California so she said she had a fear of flying but and the lawyer her lawyer said that she could not fly because she has a fear of confined spaces that came from this alleged traumatic event 36 years ago but in her first letter to Feinstein she said that she was vacationing in the mid-atlantic until August 7th and then would be in California on August 10th so she appeared I don't think she took a horse and buggy there she's apparently flying she flew up to New Hampshire she'sshe's we've seen her flying all over the place the lawyer statement was that she couldn't testify because she has a fear of flying so that just is not true right it or if she has a fear of flying it's not a debilitating fear it's a fear that she overcomes constantly so it wouldn't be an excuse for her not to come to DC so that's just a bald-faced lie somewhere in there she also won't release the therapy notes so the therapy notes don't mention Kavanagh when she talked about this in 2012 according to those therapy notes she won't mention Kavanagh but she she won't answer whether she gave these notes to the Washington Post so she was asked this yesterday during his testimony and she said I just don't remember do you don't remember this was less than 8 weeks ago surely your short-term memory must be really pretty bad your long-term memory might be a little bad too because the story keeps changing did you give him the therapy notes or not she won't hand over the therapy notes now why not I don't know what's in those therapy notes what's it look but let's have a 7th FBI investigation of brick Avenue let's do that we he's only only had six so four probably something's got through there but she won't turn over her therapy notes and then finally Ford named it when the latest version of her story she named the three men and the one girl at that party all of the three men deny it no recollection or categorically deny it and the the girl that she names they're her friend says that she has never ever met Brett Kavanaugh so anybody who could corroborate says it didn't happen including the girlfriend including the girl who was there says not only was Brett Kavanaugh not there I have never met him so no evidence whatsoever falls apart is Christine Ford lying maybe is she mistaken maybe is she a total lunatic maybe I just don't know I don't know her testimony was a little weird she wasn't dancing on the table or anything but we can we can deduce from all of that testimony that she's not credible Cavanaugh however performed very well I'll just give you in case you missed it I'll give you a little taste of his opening statement I have been a good judge and for this nomination another FBI background investigation another American Bar Association investigation 31 hours of hearings 65 senator meeting 1200 written questions more than all previous Supreme Court nominees combined throughout that entire time throughout my 53 years and seven months on this earth until last week no one ever accused me of any kind of sexual misconduct no one ever a lifetime a lifetime of public service and a lifetime of high-profile public service at the highest levels of American government and never a hint of anything of this kind and that's because nothing of this kind ever happens pre powerful stuff and now so he obviously denies that he gives some evidence he says I've never been accused as ever in my life until five seconds when I was threatening Democrats but listen to what he tells you he says I have gone through more than all of the previous Supreme Court nominees combined testimony investigations this and then this tells you something about the government breaking down about the process breaking down and it's not Republicans who are doing it it's not Republicans who use the nuclear option on judicial nominees it was Democrats it was Harry Reid he started this the Republicans are not to blame for this the Democrats are to blame and it's despicable and it's disgusting and it's bad for the government because it just wait oh just wait until the Democrats get a judicial nominee up I want Republicans to destroy that person I want them to destroy them ruin to them wreck them humiliate them and torture them not because I think that's a good thing to do to the judicial nominee I don't know anything about the judicial nominee but because the Republicans cannot unilaterally disarm we can't it is awful to the process it's unfair it's immoral to the people who go up for this for people who have judicial nominations or any other appointments or nominations it's unfair to so debase our process this way and Democrats are going to keep on doing it because they have no moral feeling whatsoever certainly those people on the judicial on the Judiciary Committee and so we should not unilaterally disarm we should give them a taste of their own medicine Republicans take the high road they try to take the high road I get it I feel like that but the process of politics is pretty ugly and you have to get your hands a little bit dirty if you're gonna do it they should wreck the next person give the Democrats a taste of their own medicine because it's despicable what they did to him Cavanaugh Dan won the Audience over when he mentioned one part where he got choked up it was visibly it was difficult for him to speak here he is I'm not questioning that dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time but I have never done this to her or to anyone that's not who I am it is not who I was I am innocent of this charge I intend no ill will to dr. Ford in her family the other night Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers and little Liza all 10 years old said to Ashley we should pray for the woman powerful stuff and by the way some people you know they watch these things and they see when people are putting on a shaky voice or they're pretending or they're acting or whatever that wasn't acting if that was acting the neck eye is Brando you know that guy that guy is really something else at that were that's him very very genuine other parts of dr. Ford's testimony I'm not I'm not so sure I'm not accusing her of performing exactly but it was a little it was less credible let's put it that way so it was a foot became a force they kept asking him about his high school yearbook they are you saw the book thing at the beginning they as and so the book thing is absurd but it also highlight it highlights not just the absurdity of that questioning but broadly about asking people what they did in high school who cares this man has been a federal judge for over a decade this man has worked for the president in a pretty high-level role this this is a serious but why who cares what they do are they gonna ask him about his high school basketball scores who could what vince is that to anybody so it became a it became a force and then then they go on to mark judge you've heard of mark judge he's this conservative guy he was also accused of being at the party and apparently he had a pretty big alcoholism problem he wrote a book where he put his friends names in it from high school you know and but he like changed their names so it was you know it changed them slightly but he'd you know give them a little shadow so here is Leahy senator leahy absolute decrepit corrupt crone asking about his friendship with Mark judge and it gets pretty ridiculous this the author to book time wasted tales of a Gen X drunk he references a Bartle Kavanagh vomiting in someone's car during beach leagues and passing out zette you he's talking about Senator Mark judge was technologies that you these talking about I'll explain if you let me proceed please mark judge was a friend of ours in high school who developed a very serious drinking problem an addiction problem that lasted decades and was very difficult for him to escape from and he nearly died and then he developed then he had leukemia as well on top of trying to get a straight answer from you under oath are you referring to yes or no that you'd have to ask him well i agree there or you barked Oh Kavanagh it was one of the names in this guy's fictionalized account of his youth where he threw in his friends names are you Bardo Cavanaugh no dummy I'm Brett Kavanaugh you have my name is right it's written on the nameplate it's written up what are you insinuating there's a fictional account of fictionalized account written by a guy who was apparently drunk throughout a lot of high school as part of his rehabilitation and you're going to say well in that in that fictionalized account he wrote where he talked about a Bartow Cavanaugh is that you I don't I don't know man I don't cares who kept like I don't know if I don't know if the fictional character in this book is referring to me obviously it's got a similar name Bartow Cavanaugh so he's clearly playing on the name for the name of the of the character but or we deduce from that that this is some journalistic account of their high school days of course not here's a sign of the Apocalypse then we're gonna have to probably gonna have to go and get to mailbag Lindsey Graham comes out and wins the day this was true moral clarity and it took moral courage to do it and I got to tell you if you would ask me two years ago if the strongest people in the United States Senate the toughest rock-ribbed can effect of conservatives were going to be Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell I would have laughed at you but I don't cocaine's a hell of a drug you know cocaine Mitch is coming out strong Coffey is a hell of a drug - and the Lindsey Graham has really gave it to them here is Lindsey Graham for all intents and purposes ending the hearing Warren at FBI investigation you could have come to us what you want to do is destroy this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020 you said that not me you've got nothing to apologize for when you see Sotomayor and Kagan tell them that Lindsey said all because I voted for them I would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy are you a gang rapist no I cannot imagine what you and your family were going through boy y'all want power god I hope you never get it I hope the American people can see through this sham that you knew about it and you held it you had no intention of protecting dr. fort none she's as much of a victim as you are god I hate to say it cuz these have been my friends but let me tell you when it comes to this you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend beautifully said absolutely right in Kavanagh then at the very end of the hearings they say uh as a man or do you believe in God Cavanaugh he says yes he says look me in the eye tell me you didn't do this I did not do this that's how it ends so what's the take away is she lying I don't know I'm more convinced that she's lying after the hearing than I was before but I don't know who's to say you can't possibly say is she credible certainly not 100% not I and I'm much more convinced of that after the hearing than I was before Democrats think this looks good for them they think that this is going to play really well with women they're sucking up to women they think that they can split off women from the GOP coalition I don't know if they realize that women have husbands and fathers and sons I'm not sure if they realize that that maybe women in America don't want men to be able to have their lives and reputations and careers destroyed over to utterly unsubstantiated in fact in many cases discredited thirty-five-year-old accusations I don't I don't I wonder if they know that it's such an obvious miscarriage of justice I don't think this plays very well they think that they can get away with this too we I mean if you just followed the twitter conversation yesterday because it plays into their intersectionality narrative so they you know I think Lindsey Graham might have even joked about this yesterday they tried to do it to Clarence Thomas it was and he played the the speech of a high-tech lynching said this is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks Brett Kavanaugh can't do this and by the ideology of intersectionality the worst people on earth are straight white men who think that they're men and they are the oppressors and everyone else should gang up and band together intersectionally and overthrow them it's a particular Marxist ideology that views all of history as this sort of struggle it's it's unfair obviously it's it's just it's just as bad to attack a straight white guy as it is to attack a gay transsexual black woman I don't know but but that's how they view the world they think the gonna be able to hit it that way I think people are sick of it there was an ad in The New York Times 1,600 men purchased an ad in the New York Times to say that we believe women we believe accusers all right that's not how our process works guys you don't just get to accuse somebody we know I we went through it all last week there are a lot of false rape accusations major ones national ones it's very bad because there's false accusations really damaged people who have legitimately some actually suffered from sexual assault or any other kind of crime and it damages them it damages the credibility of those crimes but that's the world we live in there are fake accusations people are innocent until proven guilty no matter what the Democrats want to do right now the latest update I have is flake is voting YES corkers voting yes and the and so it'll get out of committee some people are unsure as to how it'll perform in the Senate but it looks like this will proceed to a Senate vote I hope he gets through and I can't wait for Brett Kavanaugh Associate Justice Kavanaugh to be the guy who overturns roe v wade to be the swing vote that's gonna be beautiful I cannot wait and I can't wait for that next Democrat judicial nominee cuz we're gonna have a good time with that we've got a lot of mail bags you get to I've got a second bout of Facebook and YouTube go over to Daily wire comm what do you get me the under Clevenger the ben shapiro show you get to ask questions in the mailbag which is coming up and I think most importantly right now you'll get your leftist here's tumblr which is going to I mean get a look you look obviously I want you to subscribe to the website you should subscribe probably four or five times because you're going to need four or five different tumblers for what happens when Associate Justice Breck Avenel gets to that bench go to daily wire comm we'll be right back okay first question from Jamie hey Michael do you think spectral evidence should be admissible in court given their support for Christine Ford the Democrats seem to think so I was curious what you think about its validity thanks love to show Jamie spectral evidence is the evidence from dreams and hallucinations that was used during the Salem witch trials and apparently it is apparently it is I I don't think it should be admissible obviously but the Democrats do and the Democrats are half the country this also gets to an issue that we've talked about before which is the neo-paganism the neo cultish nosov the modern left because everybody's got to serve somebody everybody has a religious view so if you don't worship God the God of the Bible then you're going to worship the environment the nature God the the ecosystem that whatever this or that or the yoga Richer like Matt Walsh talks about yoga as paganism he's arriving there's this um and these kind of rituals to it which are religious in nature and you're gonna go and you're gonna descend into man's natural state which is paganism and and unreason and you're going to you're going to have Democrats demanding spectral evidence be admitted in court I mean they've they have all but done that during these hearings so I might not support it but that's the way we're headed from Agustin or Agustin I don't know hello dearest Michael I hope it's Agustin that's dearest Michael I have found myself relying solely on conservative news sources such as The Daily wire and Fox News are there any good left-wing news sources that I should look at to balance my news yes the Wall Street Journal leans left and it's news reporting and it's good the Financial Times leans left probably more left and it's reporting it's good those are obviously they have more of a focus on business for political left-wing outlets I can't think of good ones The New Republic used to be okay that fell apart few years ago no I can't really think of good ones but what that leaves you to do is that means you have to read all the crazy ones that means you should read voxcom even though it's awful in their total hacks you should read who else I don't know Mother Jones whatever you know read the left-wing crazy people because what it will at least do is when you read it outlets that have a particular opinion on the right a preference for the right then when you read the lefties you'll be able to get probably new talking points new language new ways of talking about things and you can dismiss that which is absurd but it will give you a better perspective because it's not so much different facts that they're presenting you probably get all the facts if you read the right-wing ones but you're getting different language in the left-wing ones and those different languages those different vocabularies give you a different perspective so at least you can understand what the left is saying and you can answer their arguments you should always be able to answer their arguments the benefit of being a left-wing culture is that you're constantly having to defend your views and answer other people's arguments you know how they think but they don't know how you think and one way to ensure that remains true is you got to read those crazy lefties and then you can answer them from Joseph mr. Knowles loved the show honest question why are you for individual nation states against a super national global government but for a super national global religious bureaucracy I laud the Catholic Church doesn't huge bureaucracy breed corruption isn't the church the last place we would want corruption especially to a global scale isn't global religious corruption what we're seeing now in the Catholic Church with this disgrace of a pope and bracing leftist values and defending child molesters well I'm not sure that that last part is fair he's protected people apparently knowing of abuse of priests and seminarians but I don't think there's evidence that he protected people that he knew were abuse children wooden churches based on one's conscientious interpretation of the Bible be a better model Christ calls for unity but does that mean bureaucratic unity doesn't the spirit transcend nation language while still keeping them intact anyways I want your two cents PS I love what you've done with Shapiro's broom-closet you've really made it your own Joseph well it to answer your question no I won't become a Protestant appreciate your your care no I've actually it's a good question you raise why do I support individual nation states against imperial government but I support what is an imperial church a global church a universal Church which is the meaning of the word Catholic the the reason for that ah then the nation-states came about after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 it came about because Protestants and Catholics fought a photo series of wars and the Protestants won there they at least didn't lose which means they won if there were an an empire that were a Catholic Empire a Christian Empire what christened him used to be before the modern age before the Treaty of Westphalia before the Protestant revolution if there were a United christened 'm i could support that political order it certainly worked well enough for europe when Europe was united but today we don't have a United Christendom these super national governments these giant Imperial bureaucracies are not Christian they're post Christian their secular their the European Union they're the United Nations they're the International Criminal Court they're not they're not christened them the United Nations doesn't make sense anyway because you you can't unite everybody that's the same as not having everybody be United it's that the pork part of national groups and tribal groups and clan groups is that you are different from people and you have different interests and different backgrounds and traditions so that's absurd but even the European Union if the European Union were going to be run by I don't know Charles Borromeo or somebody or is gonna be run by it's some you know strong Christian then perhaps but that isn't the case so I and and that's not coming back I don't suspect that's going to come back as for why I remain catholic it's because I think the Catholic Church was instituted by Christ people will ask why don't you go to a church that just just believes the Bible I say I attend the church and I'm a member of the church that wrote the Bible now part of the Bible Bible Bible insistence is is that this is a product of the Protestant revolution and later stages of it but I don't worship the Bible I'd love scripture but I don't worship the Bible the Bible is not the Word of God Christ is the Word of God he says so in the book which is the Bible so I don't worship the Bible the Bible is is wonderful it's it's it's revelations divine sure but it's not the whole thing and I think as Chesterton says heresy is not when you promote vice / virtue but when you prove them one virtue to the exclusion of all the others so we wouldn't want to exclude we wouldn't want to have only works to the exclusion of faith or only or you know only grace to the exclusion of freewill we wouldn't want to exclude these things only justice to the exclusion of mercy well all of these things can be held together in God and so I despite all of the many problems in my church I remain a member of it okay we've got time for I think one more to the local papist of The Daily wire how do we Catholics work around the whole thou shalt not make unto the any grave graven image thing it seems like we pretend there's an asterisk on that commandment that leads to the fine print where it says unless I come to earth and human form at some point then all bets are off I don't see any reason this should be a law that only applies to Jews like eating kosher bread on the context it's presented in but we seem to violate it pretty heavily especially since we don't just make graven images of Christ which I can almost make an exception for but also regular mortals like Mary and the Saints and even beings like angels how do we square this practice with the Bible well you've got to read the Bible more carefully you talk about the asterisk being added to the scripture the asterisk is in the scripture it's in exodus itself I think it's Exodus 20 where we see don't don't make any graven image and then in Exodus 25 God tells Moses to create statues of the angels cherubim and Seraphim he says make these statues put the constructive statutes he tells Moses to make make a serpent and put him on us put them on a stick crucify the Serpent and this will be assigned to the Israelites all shallows are clear and one cannot read one verse of the Bible out of context you have to read it in context in this quick case the context is in the same book and it's only a handful of chapters away the reason that we don't make a graven image is so that you don't worship the image but we don't worship images we they are tools of veneration there we have images I don't I don't worship other images that I see and I don't worship statues of Jesus or Mary or Saint Joseph I don't worship Mary as it is I pray to Mary but I don't worship Mary and no faithful Catholic does and it's never been a part of Catholic doctrine and it remains not that way all shallows are clear before we go I'm just getting this in now it seems that flake flaky Jeff Flake has allowed the vote out of the Judiciary Committee but he is now saying he will not vote for Cavanaugh until an FBI investigation happens Jeff Flake continuing to prove himself the single worst person who's ever called himself a Republican what a jerk to use a to be polite what a jerk so I guess we're gonna get the 7th FBI investigation now the first six the first six that's not that didn't work by
