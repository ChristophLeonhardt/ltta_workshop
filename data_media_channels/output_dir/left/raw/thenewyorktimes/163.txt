1
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:07,160
Right now in Syria, there are
roughly 2,000 American troops.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,540
And one day,
recently, a statement

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,426
went out calling for direct
attacks against them.

4
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:14,250
It said that it
was the beginning of:

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,280
The statement came from an
influential Syrian militia

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,240
called the Baqir Brigade,
which has around

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,940
3,000 members.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,540
And aside from threats
by Islamic State,

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,880
it was one of the few
times a group in Syria

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,190
directly threatened
American troops there.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,150
So why did they make the
threat in the first place?

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,220
Who is the Baqir Brigade?

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,460
Well, one clue to begin
with, is this photo.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,460
On the right, the head
of the Baqir Brigade.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,190
On the left is
Qassim Suleimani,

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,870
who runs all of Iran’s
foreign military activities.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,900
A few years ago, Syria’s
president, Bashar al-Assad,

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,870
needed help fighting
a two-front war.

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,780
So, Iran came to his aid.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,040
One tactic it used was
funding and training

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,620
pro-Assad militias, militias
like the Baqir Brigade.

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:16,440
The militia plays up its
Syrian nationalism

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,780
to help downplay the
fact that it’s actually

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,386
guided by a foreign power.

25
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:22,760
Here’s one of the
group’s banners

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,680
that sums up its motives.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,710
This, of course, is Syria’s
president — the nationalism

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,220
side of things.

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,820
But these two men
are not Syrian.

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,640
He’s the head of Hezbollah,
a Lebanese group backed

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,080
by Iran.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,430
And he’s the
Supreme Leader of Iran.

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,640
Iran’s real goal here
is to use militias

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040
to help weave influence
into all aspects

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
of Syrian society.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,710
Here’s one way it does this:

37
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,700
This is Omar al-Hassan,
the Baqir Brigade’s

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,170
political leader.

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,630
In this photo he’s in Syria.

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,300
Now here’s another photo,
except this time it’s

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,040
near the capital of Iran.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,580
He’s visiting the shrine to
Iran’s late supreme leader.

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,560
Several militias
send members to Iran

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,990
to strengthen bonds
with officials.

45
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,810
They also send groups like
these on educational trips

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,640
around the country.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,110
This is all for ideology,
but it’s also for show.

48
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,500
It puts Iran’s influence
front and center.

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,730
O.K., back to the politician,
Omar al-Hassan.

50
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,480
Here he is again, this
time back in Syria on a

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,220
meet and greet with locals.

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,610
We were able to identify
exactly where the photo

53
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,000
was taken.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,380
This was last year.

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,660
The Baqir Brigade had
just seized this area

56
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,670
from Islamic State.

57
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,160
But even if they’d wanted
to seize more ground,

58
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,270
they couldn’t.

59
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,530
The Americans and their
allies were in the way.

60
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,460
Not far from where we located
al-Hassan’s photo is a hill.

61
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,350
Recently an image
of that hill

62
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,450
was posted on a social
media account

63
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,610
linked to the Baqir Brigade.

64
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,000
The post was a threat against
American and French troops.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,590
It said:

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,700
We’ve geo-located
that hill to right

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,850
on the border between
pro-Assad territory

68
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,480
and territory where the
U.S. and its allies operate.

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,750
So it was as if to say,
‘Look how close we are.

70
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,370
We’re watching you.’

71
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,710
See, while Iran was
spreading its influence,

72
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,620
the U.S. was spreading
its own influence, too.

73
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,770
The Iranians will say, ‘We
were invited into Syria.

74
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,500
The Americans were not.’

75
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,940
And now that Iran
is nearly done

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,100
helping the regime
with its fights,

77
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,527
there’s more time to focus
on getting the Americans out.

78
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:37,290
There’s already been
a couple of times

79
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,910
when the
Baqir Brigade has come

80
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,040
into contact with Americans.

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,370
One was here, last May,
when several Iranian-backed

82
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,400
militias advanced towards
an American-run base.

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,350
That prompted U.S. airstrikes.

84
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,300
“It was necessitated
by offensive movement —

85
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,520
I don’t know there were
Iranians on the ground —

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,605
but by
Iranian-directed forces.”

87
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,080
Then, nine months
later, American troops

88
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,860
and their allies fought off an
attack by pro-regime forces.

89
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,200
We know that the
Baqir Brigade was there, too.

90
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,390
Now overall, the
U.S. says it plans

91
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,955
to check Iran’s
influence in the region.

92
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,620
“We will track down
Iranian operatives

93
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,649
and their Hezbollah proxies
operating around the world,

94
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,404
and we will crush them.”

95
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:24,470
The thing is, these
militias aren’t

96
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,210
just on the front lines.

97
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,490
They’re recruiting deep
in territory controlled

98
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,620
by the U.S. and its allies.

99
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,670
And they’ve got humanitarian
operations going on, too.

100
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,620
So that call for jihad?

101
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,230
The brigade was likely
sending a message from Iran

102
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,350
that the U.S. needs
to leave Syria.

103
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,720
And that messaging
hasn’t let up.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,060
In early June, there
was a huge gathering

105
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,380
with the Baqir Brigade
and several other groups.

106
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,810
The leader we saw earlier
with the Iranian general?

107
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,360
He was here.

108
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,780
So was the
politician al-Hassan.

109
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,820
And it took place
not far from the hill

110
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,440
we located earlier, right on
the border of their enemies.

111
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
And the title of
the gathering:

112
00:05:12,710 --> 00:00:00,000
on Syrian soil.
