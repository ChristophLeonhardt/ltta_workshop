00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,980
was so inspired that for a couple years

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,960

from a Charlie Brown Christmas on it and

one was a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> glass star that was cut</font>

40
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,270
like a prism so light would hit it and

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,920
it would make these little rainbowy

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,200
