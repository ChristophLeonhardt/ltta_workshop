00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so this is another Rosie</font>

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,270
answers and let's start straight with a

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">question from Thea dazzle who asks how</font>

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,080
do you deal with being vegetarian when

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,730
you're at a friend's house now it's not

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem for me because</font>

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,730
everyone knows I'm a vegetarian and

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,200
everyone expects me to either bring my

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,849
own thing or mess around with what's

10
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,680
being prepared in some ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font>

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,539
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate when you guys make</font>

12
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,250
the switch it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite awkward if</font>

13
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like um I'm a vegetarian every five</font>

14
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,019
minutes the key is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

15
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,820
seem as<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible for whoever</font>

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,710
you're going over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see to assure them</font>

17
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,000
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either sort our your own</font>

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,830
food or modify what's being made in a

19
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,390
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it really really easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

20
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,190
them the people who's serving just be

21
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,020
helpful rather than snooty about it and

22
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,790
then I think they will see it as no

23
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,010
trouble at all Amy likes cheese asks how

24
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,329
long I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep up this Monday</font>

25
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,190
Wednesday Friday video schedule I still

26
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,539
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really like doing</font>

27
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,070
it it's meant that I make something

28
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">three times a week at least and I'm at</font>

29
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,760
least achieve that every week which is

30
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,430
nice they'll mark one of myself whether

31
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,350
or not the things I make it good can be

32
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,789
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

33
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,190
it's 11pm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just got back from what</font>

34
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,170
I'm really really tired but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do still</font>

35
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,760
want to deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that saying that I</font>

36
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,920
promised to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it stuff but I'm going</font>

37
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and keep it up at least into a</font>

38
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christmas but we'll see what happens</font>

39
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799
with that the wolf comes home asks can

40
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,570
you do a review of casual vacancy when

41
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've finished</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it please cincy so</font>

42
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,710
please yeah I absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a review of</font>

43
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,150
it once i'm finished reading it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

44
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm 300 pages in so hopefully i'll be

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,259
done by this weekend<font color="#E5E5E5"> camden andrew asks</font>

46
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,790
about my color coding I didn't know some

47
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,530
views on my copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Dickens the bomb</font>

48
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,080
for example or I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether I</font>

49
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,470
have it to hand no I do Michael may be

50
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,060
extremely loud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> places very</font>

51
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,380
similar as well because those were the

52
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,820
books that I was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> my dissertation</font>

53
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,310
on generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a somatic color-coded</font>

54
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,049
so as I read especially first few

55
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,759
chapters I pull out<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the themes</font>

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,070
and then I use those themes as I'm

57
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,509
highlighting but the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I do</font>

58
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,920
which you might have seen is just make

59
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,200
little marks next to paragraphs I do two

60
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880
lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a star if it's a</font>

61
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,860
particularly good quotation and you are

62
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,299
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little symbols and walks sort of</font>

63
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,399
instinctively but I don't really know

64
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,740
how they break down I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

65
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,840
sort of highlighter or borrow near me

66
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
when I'm reading it's just really useful

67
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,960
tip in way to organize my thoughts one

68
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,360
reading and after reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lucid minute</font>

69
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,550
asks for advice on email etiquette I

70
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,139
think imagica is one of those things

71
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,730
that ever pretends to have

72
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">knots or two but doesn't really have an</font>

73
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,420
answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the key is to keep it</font>

74
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">polite keep things in like best your</font>

75
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,080
kind of guards at the end before your

76
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,599
name set out well with a hi or<font color="#E5E5E5"> hello at</font>

77
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,340
the start dear I think it's too formal

78
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,830
for emails but use high person's name

79
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,810
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> high a lucid minute or hello</font>

80
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,670
elusive minute and then break down the

81
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,530
main body<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the paragraph shorter is</font>

82
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,150
obviously better but sometimes you do

83
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,650
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> include more information and</font>

84
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,750
again just keep it polite and keep it

85
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,280
the same way that you would write a

86
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,920
letter that body of it is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

87
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,940
write a letter and how you've been

88
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">taught to write a letter you also asked</font>

89
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,360
whether it's essential to keep the tone

90
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,640
formal even when they aren't formal and

91
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,620
give an emailing regularly that's one of

92
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,090
those things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of play by</font>

93
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,280
ear I think it's always better to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

94
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for more than two informal however you</font>

95
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,510
can loosen up the structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit as you</font>

96
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,310
keep emailing back and forth once you

97
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,870
start sending out more kind of formal

98
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,459
and official emails you really get into

99
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,599
the habit and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

100
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,940
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up when it's appropriate to turn it</font>

101
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">down a little bit or to turn up so</font>

102
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,049
basically my sound<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play it by</font>

103
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,750
ear so useful that's all for<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

104
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,980
I was already established I am

105
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely not good but I hope you will</font>

106
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a wonderful weekend and I will see</font>

107
00:03:17,459 --> 00:00:00,000
you on Monday finalized
