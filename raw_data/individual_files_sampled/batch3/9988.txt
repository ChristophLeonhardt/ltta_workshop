HAPPENED IN D.C., THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AN AGREEMENT, A ONE-WEEK DELAY AND A NEW FBI INVESTIGATION. ALREADY BEING QUESTIONS MADE BY TOP RANKING DEMOCRATS. ALL THIS IS REPUBLICANS REMAIN FOCUSED ON GETTING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION TO A VOTE AND DOING IT SOON. REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA LINDSEY GRAHAM SITS ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, JOINS US NOW TO WEIGH IN. GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU ARE BUSY. IT'S GOOD TO HELP A NICE MAN LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH GET ON THE SUPREME COURT. Shannon: THE DEMOCRATS DON'T THINK HE SO NICE. I WANT TO READ A LITTLE BIT OF BACK-AND-FORTH. THIS STARTED ON TWITTER, AS SO MANY FIGHTS IN WASHINGTON DO. THIS IS FROM THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE YESTERDAY, NOWHERE IN ANY OF THESE SIX FBI REPORTS, REFERRING TO THE PREVIOUS BACKGROUND CHECKS, WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WAS THERE EVER A WHIFF OF ANY ISSUE AT ALL. RELATED IN ANY WAY TO INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. SENATOR DICK DURBIN SAID THE TWEET IS NOT ACCURATE. COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS MUST CORRECT IT. HE SENT A LETTER. WE ONLY DON'T NOTICE THAT TWO DEMOCRATS DIDN'T SIGN IT. NOTHING IN THE TWEET IS INACCURATE OR MISLEADING. THE COMMITTEE STANDS BY IT STATEMENT WHICH IS COMPLETELY TRUTHFUL, MORE BASELESS INNUENDO AND FALSE MIRRORS, WHAT ARE THEY REFERRING TO, THE DEMOCRATS? I CAN TELL YOU THE FACTS. KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN NOMINATED IN 2006, HE'S BEEN ON THE COURT FOR 12 YEARS. SIX BACKGROUND CHECKS BECAUSE HE WORKED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH AS HIS SECRETARY, PERSONAL SECRETARY, NOT DOING DICTATION BUTTON MANAGING THE OVAL OFFICE, EVERYTHING AROUND THE PRESIDENT. HE HAD A BACKGROUND CHECK TO GET THAT JOB. I DEREK DICK DURBIN TO GO THROUGH IT. ME TO GO THROUGH, SEE HOW WELL WE WOULD DO. SO HE'S WRONG. HE'S JUST MAKING UP ANOTHER STORY THAT'S NOT TRUE. THERE'S NOTHING IN HIS BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT SUGGEST ANYTHING CONSISTENT WITH THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM AND IF THEY HAD BEEN THEY WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SO DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN THE WAY THEY HAVE TREATED HIM AND IT IS TRUE THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE, THEY ARE JUST INCOMPETENT. THERE'S NOTHING THERE. Shannon: LET'S TALK THERE A COUPLE OF THINGS. DR. FORD LEGAL TEAMS TODAY, SENATOR GRASSLEY HAS ASKED NUMEROUS TIMES FOR RECORDINGS OF THE POLYGRAPHS, COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE MEDIA REGARDING THESE ALLEGATIONS AND HER THERAPIST KNOWS BECAUSE HE SAYS YOU GAVE SOME OF THEM TO "THE WASHINGTON POST," AT LEAST ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON POST," WE WANT THOSE. TEAM SAYS DR. FORD IS NOW PREPARED TO PROVIDE THOSE DOCUMENTS TO THE FBI WHEN SHE'S INTERVIEW. WE HAVE NOT HAD STILL NOT YET HEARD ABOUT THE FBI INTERVIEW. WON'T GIVE THEM TO COMMITTEE BUT WILL GIVE THEM TO THE FBI. IT'S JUST A GAME. THEY KEEP PLAYING A GAME AT DR. FORD'S EXPENSE. IF THIS WOULD HELP DR. FORD WHY WOULDN'T THEY GIVE THEM TO US? THE BOTTOM LINE IS DR. FORD HAS BEEN USED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HERE. THE PERSON WHO BETRAYED HER TRUST AND LEAKED HER NAME TO THE MEDIA HAD A POLITICAL AGENDA. IT WAS NOT A FRIEND IN THE POLITICAL ACTIVIST LAWYERS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY DEMOCRATIC SENATOR STAFF MEMBERS I THINK HAVE A LOT TO ACCOUNT FOR. BRETT KAVANAUGH IS THE MAN I'VE KNOWN FOR 20 YEARS. HE'S THE MAN YOU SEE IN THE RECORD AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM DURING HIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS IS DESPICABLE AND IT'S ALL FALLING APART AND IT'S ALWAYS ANOTHER REASON. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE'S A GANG RAPIST, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IS A STUMBLING, BUBBLING DRUNK, HOW ABOUT THIS, HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE A JUDGE. THIS IS THE ONE THAT OFFENDS ME THE MOST. HOW WOULD YOU REACT IF SOMEBODY DESTROYED YOUR LIFE AND YOU FOUND YOURSELF IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE NATION BEING HUMILIATED, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? Shannon: THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE COMMITTEE, SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAYS THIS ABOUT HIM NOT BEING INTERVIEWED, SHE SAYS WHEN HE WASN'T YELLING AND DEMEANING SENATORS HE WAS MAKING MISLEADING STATEMENTS THAT CAST DOUBT ON HIS OVERALL TRUSTWORTHINESS. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH FBI AGENTS SEATED ACROSS THE TABLE. NEXT UP. WHAT A JOKE. I LIKE DIANNE FEINSTEIN. I DON'T THINK SHE LEAKED DR. FORD'S NAME TO THE MEDIA PUT SOMEBODY AROUND HER MAY HAVE. IF YOU SAW THIS MAN AS YELLING, I SAW A MAN WHO WAS OFFENDED TO HIS CORE, DEFENDED HIS GOOD NAME, TOOK IT TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO DESTROY HIS FAMILY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN THAT SITUATION? SO THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW HIS TEMPERAMENT IS IN QUESTION, YOU ARE REWARDING THE WORST BEHAVIOR I'VE SEEN IN 20 YEARS IF YOU BUY THAT GARBAGE. TO ANY REPUBLICAN, TEMPERAMENT ACCORDING TO THIS DO NOT LET THESE PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND REWARD THEM BY SAYING HE'S NO LONGER FIT BECAUSE HE'S IN THE WORLD'S WORST POSITION OF DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST A BUNCH OF GARBAGE FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T CARE ABOUT FAIRNESS. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE TRUTH. IT'S BEEN ABOUT DELAYING THE HEARING TO GET PAST THE MIDTERMS TO FILL THE SEAT IN 2020. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, LISTEN TO AND Shannon: DO YOU HAVE THE VOTES, DOES HE HAVE THE VOTES WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS TO BECOME A JUSTICE? I'VE NEVER FELT MORE CONFIDENT, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TOLD, A SUMMARY OF A SUMMARY, THE FBI BACKGROUND CHECK IS GOING TO HOLD UP, IT'S GOING TO REINFORCE EVERYTHING THE COMMITTEE DID. WE WILL GET BRIEFS ABOUT IT TOMORROW. IF THAT'S THE CASE, IF THE FBI INTERVIEWS VALIDATE WITH THE COMMITTEE FOUND, I HOPE THESE THREE REPUBLICANS WHO ASKED FOR THE DELAY WILL SAY I'M SATISFIED AND WE WILL GET THIS GOOD MAN ON THE COURT. I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER ABOUT IT. I HOPE JOE MANCHIN IN WEST VIRGINIA, A FRIEND OF MINE WILL LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA, BECAUSE THEY ARE TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO. AND JOE MANCHIN IS A FRIEND BUT BRETT KAVANAUGH I'VE KNOWN FOR 20 YEARS. I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS GUY IS A BUNCH OF GARBAGE AND YOU SHOULD BE OFFENDED AND IT WILL DESTROY THE JUDICIARY. DON'T BE PART OF THIS CROWD, JO JOE. GO WITH WEST VIRGINIA. Shannon: HE HAS SAID HE
