it's yet another access to information investigation today I'll show you what those Islamic organizations told the government they would be doing with their sweet summer jobs grants from Justin Trudeau remember those things those were the summer jobs grant that Islamic groups got but Christian groups were denied earlier this year Justin Trudeau changed the rules for the annual federal government summer jobs grant program that offers funding to organizations to hire summer students now organizations seeking summer jobs funding would have to affirm that neither their core mandate nor the job itself opposed but Justin Trudeau defines as human rights including rights related to abortion sexual orientation and gender identity the whole thing stomped on charter rights and violated religious freedom this requirement to sign an attestation to Justin Trudeau's liberal values around the LGBT community and abortion led to a spike in Christian groups being denied summer jobs grants those groups who normally use that funding to feed the hungry or run summer camps for underprivileged kids or clothe and house the poor well they wouldn't sign away their conscience on the altar of the Liberal Party of Canada for the Archdiocese of Toronto alone the impact on their nearly 30 parishes and charities is 1.1 million dollars in grant applications but for Justin Trudeau we'd much rather have a homeless person go hungry or naked as long as it meant they weren't accepting help from someone who believes that life begins at conception in the private life really that's what this came down to at the end of the day and as we know now through the incredible work of Candace Malcolm at the Toronto Sun as Christian groups were being denied summer jobs funding on mass radical Islamist organizations with ties to terror we're getting Canadian tax dollars because they checked that attestation box so we did what we do around here we just one step deeper we filed an access to information request into the government because we wanted to know what those Islamic groups were seeing summer jobs funding we're doing with that sweet taxpayer cash while Christian groups were being denied now according to Malcolm's report Abu Huraira Center was approved for a grant despite a past affiliation with another of Canada's most notorious Muslim hate preachers bilal philips though the organization states he has not preached there since 2013 phillips is frequently featured on the on the abu huraira center's youtube page including videos uploaded as recently as 2018 phillips was arrested in the philippines in 2014 for inciting and recruiting people to conduct terrorist activities as well as his extremist views and possible link to terrorist groups the jamaican-born canadian is also banned from the US UK Germany and Australia Malkin reports Phillips is also known for his anti-gay rhetoric he has called homosexuality evil and dangerous and has said that under Islamic law the punishment is death well now I have the signed jobs grant application for Abu Huraira Center Abu Huraira Center claims that their summer jobs funding will support a minority official language community what does that even mean support a minority official language community anyone who speaks English or French but isn't white you can get a grant for that now or does it mean that they're serving the minority official language which would be French now I doubt that this Toronto area mosque provides many services to Toronto francophones in Arabic either way I don't know how the Liberals missed this mistake but yet managed to disqualify countless other Christian groups because they didn't check that attestation box and why weren't these questions being asked how could abu huraira check the attestation to gay rights and hire and feature an anti-gay preacher oh but the Abu Huraira Center was hitting all the right progressive high notes as they listed their focus of activities they include members of a visible minority persons who are homeless or street involved they use persons that's good children and youth seniors crime prevention newcomers to Canada of course including refugees and another Malcolm report she detailed the hate of the Canadian Arabic Federation she reported in 2009 CAF was defunded over the group's extremism and support for terrorist groups a decision made by the previous Harper Conservative government and backed up by a federal judge CAF had received a grant through the Department of Immigration to provide English lessons for newcomers but the contract was pulled when then Immigration Minister Jason Kenney found out about the funding Kenney wrote a letter to CAF informing them that the funding would be pulled because of the group's promotion of hatred anti-semitism and support for the banned organizations Hamas and Hezbollah Kenney said that CIFS President attacked former Liberal leader Bob Rae because his wife is Jewish Malcolm also reports the Canadian Arab Federation appealed the decision but a federal court judge ruled in favor of the Harper government determining that Kenny acted reasonably when he cut the federal fund and again I have their jobs grant application with the signed attestation to abortion and gay rights the Canadian Arab Federation also said that they focus their activities towards members of a visible minority groups with social and employment barriers children and youth seniors and of course newcomers to Canada including refugees and knowing what we know now about the Canadian Arab Federation's history of supporting terror and rabid anti-semitism and the Canadian government's very high profile battle with them their men as listed in their application is pretty laughable the CIFS focus is on building a stronger and more inclusive programs and services delivery to Canadians of Arab origin to help them integrate and live a productive and rewarding life in today's Canadian society they hate Jews and have terror ties tell me more about inclusivity again they claim to be serving an official language minority community looks like CAF didn't have to sue to try to get access to taxpayer money all they had to do is check a box and say they like gays and abortion and use all the right buzzwords and lastly this is what one of Malcolm's reports said about that Anatolia Islamic Center the Anatolia Islamic Center also has a history of controversy the center's Imam made headlines in 2013 for anti-gay comments caught on tape a man Mustafa Kitab was asked about homosexuality during a lecture at the Edmonton Islamic Academy Kitab who is still listed as the Imam of the Anatolia Islamic Center tells the room of young students that being gay is like having a disease that requires a special treatment he said for me someone who is homosexual is like someone who has diabetes or someone who has cancer or AIDS noting he doesn't like to be associated with gay people Malcolm reports when the video surface current Liberal MP canned hair called for the school to lose its 4 million dollars in taxpayer funding the Anatolia Center had clearly been in the headlines for their stance on homosexuality they even drew the ire of a liberal Kent hare the facts were a literal Google search away again I had the Anatolia Islamic centres application the Anatolia Islamic centre checked that attestation to gay rights they got their grant and they use that cash to hire an assistant to their Imam to start coordinating the prayers and religious sermons within the mosque that's the same Imam that called homosexuality something like cancer or AIDS by the way oh but they hired a visible minority so I guess that's all even-steven I guess but Christian summer camps or the mustard seed helping homeless people they weren't eligible for any of this because they were honest in their views about life and traditional marriage the Christian groups refused to perjure themselves on government documents for a government grant for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read it's the age of social media censorship but here at the rebel we are prepared for that we have a rebel media mobile app it's available on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store download it give it a whirl and go around social media censorship
