00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,590
- [Narrator] The Cleveland Browns

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,093
have been struggling for a long time.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,370
In 2016 they went one and 15.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,450
In 2017 it somehow didn't get any better,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,230
as they went 0 and 16, and they scored

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,970
the least points of any team in the NFL.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,450
- For the entirety of my life
it's been a comical atrocity.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,070
My name is Manny, I'm from Columbus, Ohio,

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,653
and I've been a Cleveland
Browns fan for my whole life.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,760
There's been just no
level of remote success

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,760
for the entire time I've been alive.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,310
- [Narrator] But the
Browns didn't always suck.

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,590
In the pre-Super Bowl era, the team won

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,770
eight league championships, and one of

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,260
the great running backs of
all time, Jim Brown, spent

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,210
his entire career in Cleveland,

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,160
where he was named MVP three times.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,030
- That's, like, before my
time, so all I know is failure.

19
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,907
- You've got to have a vision how you want

20
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:06,740
to develop your football team,

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,610
and I don't think the Browns
ever had that blueprint.

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,230
- [Narrator] Terry Bradshaw
is an NFL Hall of Famer

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,840
who led the Pittsburgh Steelers
to four Super Bowl wins,

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,690
and he knows a thing or two
about starting at the bottom.

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,040
When the Steelers signed him in 1970,

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,140
they were the worst team in the league.

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,270
- When you make bad
drafts, when you don't have

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,850
a vision of how you want to build

29
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,050
your football team, this
is what you get into.

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,340
- [Narrator] In 1995, when
Bill Belichick was the coach,

31
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,920
the Browns packed up
and moved to Baltimore

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,050
where the team became known as the Ravens.

33
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,210
Four years later, the Browns were back

34
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,200
in Cleveland as an expansion team,

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,680
but since 1999 the Browns have

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,290
had only one playoff appearance.

37
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,140
- Their badness has defied all logic.

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,150
It's been a combination

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,520
of management, coaching, awful drafting.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,740
I think the easiest way to pin down

41
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,640
the Browns' struggles since
they moved back in 1999

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,650
is an inability to find a quarterback.

43
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,460
They have a tendency to try and get

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,030
the flashy player that
isn't gonna succeed.

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,960
Brady Quinn, Johnny
Manziel, these were guys

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,910
that were, like, big
names in college football

47
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,467
that people were excited
to see in the pros

48
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,290
and really crashed and burned quickly.

49
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,990
- [Narrator] Whether it
was through poor scouting

50
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,540
or coaching, the Browns franchise
has notoriously struggled

51
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,207
with their first round
picks over the years.

52
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,390
And with the first pick
in the 2018 NFL draft,

53
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,780
the Browns selected
quarterback Baker Mayfield,

54
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,990
but the team isn't betting
it all on their rookie QB.

55
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,861
Instead, they're focusing on
the long game, letting Mayfield

56
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:40,470
develop behind starting
veteran Tyrod Taylor.

57
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,090
- Those moves indicate to me that

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,870
they're finally planning
and, like, thinking about

59
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,740
the Cleveland Browns beyond
the next eight weeks.

60
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,430
That's one of the reasons
I think this iteration

61
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,460
of the Browns might actually
be the one to buck the trend.

62
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,210
- [Narrator] There was a slight
glimmer of home in week one,

63
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,700
when the Browns tied the Steelers

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,774
the first opening game
of the regular season

65
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,133
without a loss since 2004.

66
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,330
- You know, they're on the right track.

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,120
Just keep putting the
pieces of it together.

68
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,480
Josh Gordon came back, the wide receiver.

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,070
You're talking about a weapon.

70
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,350
Their tight end is pretty good.

71
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,910
Their running back is pretty good.

72
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,152
They're slowly getting
better, so don't be surprised.

73
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,670
The Browns could win five
or six games, I think.

74
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,860
- All I want this year is like
five or six wins, honestly.

75
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,550
A lot of people are wanting the Browns

76
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,520
to go to the Playoffs this year,

77
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,550
but for me I just get a couple wins.

78
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,970
For some reason, I think this is

79
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,420
one of those situations where it's like

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,740
the past 20 years have been horrible,

81
00:03:28,740 --> 00:00:00,000
but it's darkest before the dawn.
