“Testing, can you hear me?”
“I don’t want nobody.”
The simple thing
about Aretha Franklin
is she was a great singer, a
singer who could do anything.
“The moment I wake up …”
She could do rhythm and blues,
she could do jazz,
she could do opera.
She could do country, probably.
They started calling
her the Queen of Soul
in the ’60s, when she
was barely in her 20s,
and nobody argued.
People heard Aretha,
and they were inspired.
And it was an inspiration that
she channeled from gospel,
into soul music,
into music that spoke
to people’s daily lives.
There were songs like “Think,”
which is a warning shot
across a relationship.
It’s one of the few
songs she wrote,
and it’s one of her
strongest messages.
She had 100 songs in
the Billboard R&B charts
and 17 pop hit singles,
but what was more important
was the way she
freed other singers,
the way she showed
other singers
this is how a voice can fly.
You can hear Aretha Franklin
in Whitney Houston.
You can hear Aretha Franklin
in Chaka Khan.
You can hear Aretha Franklin
in men, too, Luther Vandross.
I mean, you can hear
Aretha Franklin across R&B
and across American music.
She wasn’t always
in the charts.
There were long stretches of
the late ’70s, the late ’80s,
when she couldn’t get a hit.
I think the people who were
giving her material often
let her down.
“What do you do if
you forget a lyric?”
“I keep stepping.”
“You keep moving fast?"
You see here at the end of her
career singing an Adele song …
and you think what if Aretha
had better songwriters
all the way
through her career?
She would have even more than
those 100 R&B singles.
“Respect” was first
recorded by Otis Redding,
and for Otis Redding,
it was, “Come on, when
I get home, baby, you know,
be nice to me, I worked.”
When Aretha gets it as a
woman and turns it around,
“R-E-S-P-E-C-T.”
It’s about much
more than that.
It’s about respect
for her as a woman,
it’s about respect
for her as a person.
It’s about respect for her as
a breadwinner in this song.
But it’s also about
sexual respect and
physical respect —
it’s everything.
“Anywhere I’ve gone in the
world, people love that song” —
“They do” —
“Did you have any idea when
you recorded ‘Respect’ that it
was going to be what it was?”
“No, I really did not.
I did not have any idea
that the civil rights movement
would adopt
that as its mantra.”
“My country, ’tis of thee …”
Her father had been involved
in the civil rights struggle.
She was close to
Martin Luther King.
She was involved
back in the ’60s.
To see America’s first
African-American president
be inaugurated, this was a
culmination of something,
and you had to have
Aretha Franklin there.
“All right, thank you.
Good evening, how’s
everybody tonight?
Feel good?
Looking out on
the morning rain ...”
Aretha Franklin was
the Queen of Soul,
gospel music applied
to secular topics.
And that meant putting all
of the airborne improvisation
of gospel into songs about
fighting with your guy,
and bringing that spirit,
channeling that ecstatic
spirit into really
down-to-Earth situations.”
“Gospel goes with
me wherever I go.
Gospel is a constant with me.”
“Amazing Grace” is
a gospel standard.
Everybody who sings gospel
music knows “Amazing Grace.”
It’s a beautiful song.
And when you hear
Aretha Franklin sing that song,
it’s just transcendent.
“Amazing grace, how sweet …”
There was always
that feeling that she
was channeling some
higher power into whatever
she was singing.
“... the sound.”
