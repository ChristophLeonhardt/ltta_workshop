1
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,593
>> Tucker: YOU MAY HAVE MISSED

2
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,595
IT BUT ROBERT MUELLER INDICTED

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,931
13 RUSSIAN NATIONALED AND THREE

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,933
RUSSIAN COMPANIES EARLIER THIS

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,233
YEAR.

6
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,735
THE THOUGHT IS THEY WOULDN'T

7
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:19,369
SHOW UP FOR COURT.

8
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:20,570
NOW THEY'RE CONTESTING AND THE

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,372
CASE IS GOING TO COURT AND THAT

10
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:26,576
MIGHT BE BAD FOR ROBERT

11
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,177
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION.

12
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:27,811
HOW AND WHY?

13
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:28,812
NOBODY CAN ANSWER THOUGH

14
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:30,080
QUESTIONS MORE THAN JOSEY.

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,848
WHY WOULD THIS BE BAD TO GO TO

16
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:32,148
TRIAL?

17
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,750
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT READY FOR

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,017
IT.

19
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:36,353
THEY INDICTED A CASE PREMATURELY

20
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:38,388
AGAINST PEOPLE THAT THEY NEVER

21
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:40,523
THOUGHT WOULD SHOW UP FROM

22
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:40,857
RUSSIA.

23
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,425
ONE OF THE RUSSIAN COMPANY HIRED

24
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,526
LAWYERS AND SENT THEM TO COURT

25
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:47,197
TO SAY WE'RE HERE AND WE WANT TO

26
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:50,533
PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND WE WANT

27
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:51,935
DISCOVERY ON YOUR CRIMINAL CASE

28
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:52,669
AGAINST US.

29
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,070
MR. MUELLER'S PEOPLE OBJECTED

30
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,873
AND SAID WE'RE NOT READY FOR AN

31
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:57,273
ARRAIGNMENT.

32
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,008
THEY'RE NOT HERE PROPERLY.

33
00:00:59,008 --> 00:00:59,809
THE FEDERAL JUDGE SAID,

34
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,544
MR. MUELLER, YOU INDICTED THIS

35
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:01,845
CASE.

36
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:03,813
IT'S YOUR CASE.

37
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,447
IT'S GOING TO TRIAL.

38
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,684
LET'S START THIS PROCESS RIGHT

39
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:07,951
NOW.

40
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:08,852
GET DISCOVERY.

41
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,053
>> Tucker: YOU'RE SAYING HE

42
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,354
INDICTED PEOPLE WITHOUT BEING

43
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:12,455
READY TO PROVE THEY'RE GUILTY?

44
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:13,223
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

45
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:15,158
HE A BECAUSED THE GRAND JURY

46
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,893
PROCESS AS HE HAS FROM THE

47
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:19,396
BEGINNING OF THIS OUTRAGEOUS

48
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:20,230
INVESTIGATION AUTHORIZED BY

49
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,364
MR. ROSENSTEIN.

50
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:25,235
THIS IS ROSENSTEIN'S MONSTER IN

51
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:25,802
SPADES.

52
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:27,904
>> Tucker: YOU WERE A FEDERAL

53
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,239
PROSECUTOR.

54
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,075
IT SEEMS BORDERLINE IMMORAL TO

55
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,144
INDICT SOMEBODY UNLESS THEY'RE

56
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:34,477
GUILTY.

57
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:38,314
>> THEY DID IT FOR ONE REASON

58
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:38,615
ONLY.

59
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,450
ROBERT MUELLER NEEDED SOMETHING

60
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,718
RUSSIAN TO MAKE HIS

61
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:42,385
INVESTIGATION LOOK GOOD.

62
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:45,655
HE INDICTED 13 PEOPLE AND

63
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:46,456
CORPORATIONS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

64
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:47,557
THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD NEVER SHOW

65
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:49,592
UP AND BINGO, ONE OF THEM SHOWS

66
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:52,962
UP AND SAYS PROVE IT, MOTHER.

67
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,397
>> Tucker: THAT'S AN

68
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:55,098
UNBELIEVABLE STORY.

69
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:58,234
IMAGINE IF HE DID THAT TO

70
00:01:58,234 --> 00:01:59,669
AMERICANS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,

71
00:01:59,669 --> 00:01:59,969
FLYNN.

72
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,304
>> HE ALREADY HAS.

73
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,773
HE DOES IT TO MR. FLYNN.

74
00:02:03,773 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: UNBELIEVABLE.
