even myself I didn't wear I wore it at the game but I didn't wear my England shirt at the first day out because we weren't sure what to expect I'll be honest I had some of the same thoughts in my head we'd been told for example every single person I told I was going to Russia for the World Cup in the build-up to this said the same thing are you worried are you worried I got here and listened within a few hours I felt very at home it's been fantastic you know we've had absolutely zero issues whatsoever I say to anyone at home that's still trying has the ability to get out to support England before it might be too late get out here it's been fantastic these challenges that we're probably for maybe there's some people thought we'd get I was hoping quarterfinals so we're where I think we should have got to anything now and on top of that is a bonus right so but because of the fact that we've got this route you know we've got this route to the final which seems I would say easy but I'd say it seems like it's achievable you
