THE FACT THAT THE

90
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,549

96
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,061
AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK THE

97
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:23,828
TALK ABOUT THIS GUY, AS FAR AS

98
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:27,098
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT A SPY

99
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:28,733
EMBEDDED IN THE CAMPAIGN IS

100
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:29,267
HYPERBOLE.

101
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,468
HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE

102
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:32,303
ABOUT THEIR CONTACTS WITH RUSSIA

103
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:34,872
THAN WE KNOW ABOUT IS NOT AN

104
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:35,306
INVENTED SPY.

105
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:36,741
MAYBE IT'S AN INFORMANT BUT IT'S

106
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,009
NOT QUITE WHAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING

107
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,878
IT OUT TO BE FEARED THAT KEYWORD

108
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,281
OR KEY PHRASE IN ROSENSTEIN

109
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,983
STATEMENT WAS "FOR ANY

110
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:47,252
INAPPROPRIATE PURPOSE."

111
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,686
THERE IS AMPLE REASON THAT THEY

112
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:50,588
MAYBE SHOULD'VE LOOKED INTO

113
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,823
RUSSIAN COLLUSION OR SUSPICION

114
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:52,490
OF IT.

115
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,058
IF THERE WAS OTHER REASONS WHY

116
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,361
THEY WERE DOING IT, IF THEY WERE

117
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,495
TRYING TO UNDO OR HURT

118
00:02:57,495 --> 00:02:58,229
PRESIDENT TRUMP OR IF THERE IS

119
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,464
REASON TO BELIEVE THERE WAS

120
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:00,765
POLITICAL MOTIVATION, THAT WOULD

121
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:01,566
BE VERY BAD AND IT'S WORTH

122
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,068

123
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:05,903

127
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:12,844
BUMPING INTO THE

128
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,445
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS PRUDENT

129
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,848
GIVEN THAT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED,

130
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,449
POTENTIAL MISUSE OR ABUSE OF

131
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,052
POWER DURING THE 2016 ELECTION,

132
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:21,919
STILL WORKING INSIDE THE JUSTICE

133
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,055
DEPARTMENT ARE AT THE FBI.

134
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,290
INSPECTOR GENERAL DOESN'T HAVE

135
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,625
JURISDICTION TO INTERVIEW

136
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,359
POLITICAL EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED

137
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:30,328
IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHO

138
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,262
MAY NOW BE GONE.

139
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:33,064
I WOULD GET BACK TO THE NOISE

140
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:35,867
SURROUNDING THE ISSUE COMES DOWN

141
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,468

142
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,871
COASTAL OF THE FIRST PLACE.

143
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:42,473
WHETHER THERE WERE LEGAL

144
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,274
INSTANCES OF AUTHORITY BEING

145
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,310
ABUSED IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN FOR

146
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,843
POLITICAL PURPOSES.

147
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:48,313
THE QUESTION IS, YOU LOOK AT

148
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,915
WHEN THE INVESTIGATION HAPPENED,

149
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:51,616
AFTER THE HILLARY CLINTON

150
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:53,117
CAMPAIGN INVESTIGATION WRAPPED

151
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:56,421
UP, THEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS

152
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:57,555
ALLEGEDLY GETTING -- AND

153
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:58,656
INFORMANT WAS GIVING INFORMATION

154
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,090
TO THE FBI.

155
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,559
IF IT WAS REALLY JUST ABOUT

156
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,894
RUSSIAN SURVEILLANCE AND

157
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:03,695
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION,

158
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:05,663
THEN WHY DID THE INVESTIGATION

159
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,231
STARTED EARLIER IN 2015 WHEN THE

160
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:09,167
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION KNEW ABOUT

161
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,836
RUSSIA'S PLANS TO BATTLE IN THE

162
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,438

BOTTOM OF WHAT ELSE WAS USED IN

171
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,488
THAT FISA BECAUSE YOU HAVE MANY

PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

173
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:33,491

ARE WRONG.

175

COMMITTEE.

192
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,893
THIS IS A STRUGGLE TO DEFINE

193
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,461
WHAT IS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF

194
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,096
OVERSIGHTS AND WHAT IS

195
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:12,463
OVERREACH.

196
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:14,932
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

197
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:17,869
THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE FBI

198
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:18,436
MIGHT'VE CONDUCTED THE

199
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:20,705
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION

200
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,373
BUT STILL SAY YOU CAN'T SHARE

201
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:23,708
RAW INTELLIGENCE FROM AN

202
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,976
INVESTIGATION THAT COULD BE

203
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,244
PROVIDED TO THE WITNESSES.

204
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:31,916
TODAY YOU HAD DNI, FBI, EVERYONE

00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,227
WERE REVEALED IN A

212

"NEW YORK TIMES" STORY THIS

213
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,231
WEEKEND.

214
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:51,335
YOU CAN'T DEMAND THAT YOU BE

215
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:52,403
GIVEN INFORMATION ON A WITNESS

216
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,138
IN EXCHANGE FOR TALKING TO THE

217
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:55,273
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

218
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,441

219
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,877
WHICH THE DEMANDS FOR THE

00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,879
DOCUMENTS ARE BEING MADE, HE WAS

221
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,613
DOING THAT IN HIS CAPACITY NOT

222
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,250
AS A SUBJECT OF THE MUELLER

223
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,218
INVESTIGATION BUT AS PRESIDENT

224
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:08,085
OF THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE

225
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:09,687
SURE THAT CONGRESS IS GETTING

226
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:10,755
WHAT THEY NEED FROM THE

227
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:11,489
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

228
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:14,492
THEY ARE DOING A REALLY, REALLY

229
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:15,460
GOOD JOB OF MUDDYING AND THIS

230
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,095

ALLOWED AND WHAT IS AND ISN'T

232
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:19,864
APPROPRIATE.

233
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:22,200
IT'S A HUGE BATTLE THAT'S

234
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,268
DRAWING OUT ON BOTH SIDES BUT

235
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:26,304
THE PRESIDENT AND RUDY GIULIANI

236
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,004
AND DEVIN NUNES ARE TRYING TO

237
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:32,677
MAKE IT APPEAR THAT

238
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:33,778
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT, MEMBERS

239
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:35,646
OF CONGRESS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,514
EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT.

241
00:06:36,514 --> 00:00:00,000
THE TRUTH IS THEY DON'T.
