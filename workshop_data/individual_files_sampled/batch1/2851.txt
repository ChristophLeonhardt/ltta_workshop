actually it's going to sound a little trite but it's kind of a version of bloom where you're planted convince yourself that the best job you ever had is this one and really really try to excel in it look I I became the director of the Central Intelligence Agency I'm I'm a very very lucky man I can tell you straight up totally honest I never planned to be director I never expected to be director I never maneuvered myself in a way that would make me more eligible to be director I got struck by lightning now when the lightning struck I had to go and perform and so I guess my advice to everyone is that the best job you have the most important job you have certainly is the one you're in now
