STEVE: AS THE MEDIA FINS ITS OBSESSION WITH MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION THE LEAD DEMOCRATS THE LEAD THE DEMOCRATS ONCE HAD AHEAD OF THE MID TERMS IS DWINDLING AHEAD OF RECENT POLLING. A "THE WASHINGTON POST"-ABC NEWS POLL SAW THE DEMOCRATIC LEAD FALL FROM 12% IN JANUARY TO 4 IN APRIL. SO WHAT IS GOING ON? HERE TO WEIGH IN FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ARI FLEISCHER. ARI, IS IT RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA? RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM, PROBLEM, PROBLEM FOR THE DEMOCRATS UNLESS MUELLER HAS GOT THE GOODS. IF MUELLER DOESN'T, THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONE TRICK PONY AND THAT PONY AIN'T RIDING ANYMORE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING INTO SCANDAL. STEVE: ULTIMATELY, THE DECISION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE IN NOVEMBER WHO DID SOMETHING FOR ME? WAS IT THE REPUBLICANS WHO DID THE TAX CUT WHICH THE DEMOCRATS REGARD AS CRUMBS ON THE WAY TO TALKING MORE ABOUT RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. AND IT'S NOT ONLY THAT. IT'S HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS THE FACT WE HAVE 3.9% UNEMPLOYMENT. THE PRESIDENT IS WISE TO KEEP BANGING ON THE FACT THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT ALL-TIME LOW. CAN HE ACTUALLY MAKE UP GOOD NUMBERS WITH THOSE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT NUCLEAR OUT THERE, THE PRESIDENT'S GROOFL WAS AT 58% IN DECEMBER AND NOW DOWN TO 58% THIS MORNING. IF THAT NUMBER GETS BELOW 50. THAT IS HUGE FOR REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION BECAUSE THAT TAKES A LOT OF THE ENERGY AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS WHO CAN'T STAND DONALD TRUMP AND THAT'S WHAT DROVE A LOT OF THE TURNOUT FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS. INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT SORT OF MESSAGE THE DEMOCRATS DO COALESCE AROUND AS YOU GET A LITTLE CLOSER BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S A LITTLE UNEVEN. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM. THE SMART MAN AND WOMEN DOWN IN WASHINGTON WERE GOING WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE TARIFFS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. BUT, IT'S THE LITTLE GUY. IT'S THE FORGOTTEN AMERICAN WHO IS GOING THEY ARE SITTING ON THEIR COUCH RIGHT NOW GOING DAMN RIGHT! DO YOU KNOW HOW ELSE YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE? WHILE MUCH OF THE PRESS ONLY QUOTED REPUBLICANS WHO OPPOSED TARIFFS. THEY NEVER QUOTED THE MANY DEMOCRATS THAT SUPPORTED NOW I HAVE NEVER BEEN RAISED TO BELIEVE IN TARIFFS? BUT IS HE TAKING ON CHINA. THAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE THAT DONALD TRUMP DESERVES CREDIT FOR. HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE WITH THEIR MESSAGE. RIGHT NOW, OUTSIDE OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, DEMOCRATS' ONLY MESSAGE IS GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTHCARE. HIGHER TAXES AND DONALD TRUMP COMMITTED TREASON. THAT'S THEIR POLICY PLATFORM. IT'S NOT A VERY STRONG ONE. STEVE: BUT, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO THAT PERFECTLY. SOME PEOPLE DO. AND THAT WILL BE THE LIBERAL WING THAT PUSHES THE PARTY LEFT IN THE 2019-2020 PRIMARIES. ENERGY AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. IT'S THE INTENSITY OF OPPOSITION. STEVE: PLUS MOST OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA BEATING THE
