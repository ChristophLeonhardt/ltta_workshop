1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,710
most of the areas where the Islamic

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,109
state is active or has you know a

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,200
presence are effectively off-limits to

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">Western journalists</font>

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,040
good afternoon I'm David Enders I'm a

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,050
producer and correspondent for Vice

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,680
covering the Middle East since January

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,380
I've been reporting from Lebanon and

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,420
Iraq and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to talk today about</font>

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's happening in the Middle East</font>

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,970
specifically the push by the Islamic

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,400
state that seen them take large amounts

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,340
of territory in Syria<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Iraq hey David</font>

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,960
thanks for coming on the show and good

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,790
afternoon indeed we've got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,920
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who want to talk to you and some</font>

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them are on skype so let's start with</font>

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">kaylee I was calling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us from Eugene</font>

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,500
Oregon hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> David hey how's it going good</font>

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,900
so my first question is in the

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,240
documentary<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Ramadi it was said that</font>

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only international support that</font>

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,510
they've received so far has been in the

24
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,640
form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> airstrikes but this is in</font>

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
contradiction to us claims that their

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,070
coalition is providing training arming

27
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,130
consulting along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> air support why is</font>

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,190
there this contradiction well it's not

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,040
entirely a contradiction the u.s. is

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,439
providing training for Iraqi forces

31
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,289
however it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very small and there</font>

32
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:34,119
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a number of snags with the</font>

33
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,880
Iraqi government<font color="#E5E5E5"> who doesn't approve of</font>

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,969
everyone the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is training elements</font>

35
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,200
of people within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> American government</font>

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,140
have proposed directly arming different

37
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,079
factions in Iraq including<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunnah tribe</font>

38
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,990
Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar province that

39
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">are pro-government however the Iraqi</font>

40
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,189
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't want these people</font>

41
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly armed they want to control the</font>

42
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,219
flow of arms there's also been attacks

43
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,049
on some of the bases where the US was

44
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,049
training a so training<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

45
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,600
intermittent it's been suspended and we

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,008
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really haven't seen any real</font>

47
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,120
effects of it yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um then how many</font>

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,250
other cities in Iraq are in the same

49
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,330
situation as her body was last month

50
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,760
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many cities and towns that are</font>

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,860
there in similar situations that have

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,319
been laid siege to by the Islamic state

53
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,900
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Iraq but also in Syria</font>

54
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,780
particularly in Anbar province there are

55
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,510
areas where sometimes the Islamic state

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,950
is in control sometimes government

57
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,150
forces are in control

58
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,640
sometimes effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one is in</font>

59
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,319
control but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number of</font>

60
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">different cities that are that are in a</font>

61
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,739
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> way ok and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why hasn't the</font>

62
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,360
mainstream media<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like kept up</font>

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,319
with with these cities well one thing is

64
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're inaccessible effectively we</font>

65
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,810
were the first vice news was was the

66
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,629
first crew that had<font color="#CCCCCC"> traveled to Ramadi</font>

67
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:08,849
actually into the city in almost a year

68
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,639
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,379
extremely dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get there it's</font>

70
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,750
extremely dangerous once you're there

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,569
and and if you're going further west

72
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,150
than Ramadi are also in eastern Syria

73
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,239
most of the areas where the Islamic

74
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,639
state is active or has you know a

75
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,730
presence are effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> off-limits to</font>

76
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,750
Western journalists<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um last</font>

77
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,439
question what factors do you think have

78
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,459
led to Isis advancement in Iraq well the

79
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,940
primary factor is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the massive</font>

80
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,190
disenfranchisement of not just Iraqis

81
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,489
but Syrians at the hands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Iraqi</font>

82
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,069
and Syrian government's and also as a

83
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,190
result of the American invasion in 2003

84
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,949
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. disbanded the Iraqi army</font>

85
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">they took away a means of support from</font>

86
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,870
hundreds of thousands of people and many

87
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,000
of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> were then barred from finding</font>

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,489
other God other jobs in government in

89
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,370
Iraq like many Middle Eastern countries

90
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,029
is a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> most jobs come from the</font>

91
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,039
government from one<font color="#E5E5E5"> government ministry</font>

92
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,400
or another so people have been very

93
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,669
receptive to virtually any group that's

94
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,190
fighting the Iraqi government<font color="#CCCCCC"> or that</font>

95
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,620
claims to represent their interests when

96
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,300
they're pretty convinced that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Iraqi</font>

97
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,159
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't represent their</font>

98
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,370
interests okay thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your questions</font>

99
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,110
those were great thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let's go</font>

100
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,270
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you all right thanks Kaylee</font>

101
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,060
so uh David we got a tweet from Rick

102
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,840
Grimes

103
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,750
who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know why I despite claims</font>

104
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,479
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're better armed and they have</font>

105
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">more fire support than the Islamic state</font>

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,470
the Iraqi army<font color="#CCCCCC"> continues to retreat in</font>

107
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,000
the face of battle what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is well one I think misconception</font>

109
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,380
is that the Iraqi army<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point is</font>

110
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,990
better armed than the Islamic state they

111
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,580
do have air support however the Iraqi

112
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,350
government's air support is not

113
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,280
particularly effective and even the

114
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> airstrikes versus the</font>

115
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Islamic state elements on the</font>

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,020
ground are somewhat insignificant<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

117
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,970
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the Islamic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state capturing</font>

118
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,060
heavy weaponry including anti-armor

119
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,919
rockets from Syrian regime stockpiles

120
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,930
you have them capturing American

121
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,419
equipment especially armored Humvees and

122
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,199
even tanks from the Iraqi army<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

123
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,470
then are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being turned on the Iraqi army</font>

124
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pretty substantial effect and then</font>

125
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,919
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the Iraqi</font>

126
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">army even before the Islamic states push</font>

127
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,349
was on paper much bigger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

128
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,289
actually was the corruption was

129
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,760
considerable and there were in some

130
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,470
cases people suggest hundreds of

131
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,450
thousands of what are called ghost

132
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,090
soldiers where these were people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

133
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,039
were officially on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payroll had</font>

134
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,770
either deserted or or never even shown

135
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,630
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for duty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first place and their</font>

136
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,500
commanders were simply collecting

137
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,889
collecting their paychecks so you have a

138
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,380
very determined<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting force versus a</font>

139
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,090
force with somewhat low morale very

140
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,080
corrupt leadership and and like I just

141
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">said you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily in</font>

142
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,910
possession of better weapons at all

143
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,340
times than the Islamic state and these

144
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,870
car bombs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've used especially</font>

145
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,760
in the takeover of Ramadi have been

146
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,300
stayed in well thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer I</font>

156
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,780
military<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement at its current form</font>

157
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,450
as a sustainable way to combat the

158
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,250
Islamic state or are there other more

159
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,440

160
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,780
parallel and that can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> restore</font>

161
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,920
stability well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of</font>

162
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,970
people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about it but at</font>

163
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,030
some point negotiations with the Islamic

164
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,360
state are probably going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary</font>

165
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,100
traditionally just using an American

166
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,640
example American policy is often what

167
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,260
they call a two-track policy where you

168
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,880
have a military<font color="#E5E5E5"> option but also</font>

169
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,080
diplomatic engagement whether it's very

170
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,420
secretive whether it's back channel but

171
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:09,350
it exists in 2007-2008 US military

172
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,420
commanders were actually engaging with

173
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,730
Iraqi groups that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting the US</font>

174
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,560
military they were having secret

175
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,420
meetings and Jordan looking for a

176
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,960
political solution one was never reached

177
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,540
which is part of the reason you have the

178
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,390
Islamic state now same thing with the US

179
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,450
military and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Afghan government</font>

180
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,490
speaking two elements of the Taliban in

181
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,640
a similar way and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if there's any</font>

182
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,919
hope for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation Afghanistan to be</font>

183
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,260
resolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's through some kind of</font>

184
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,520
political accommodation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Islamic</font>

185
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,560
state it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> because because</font>

186
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,010
they do seem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group that cannot be</font>

187
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,540
negotiated with but it's also important

188
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to keep in mind that one of the major</font>

189
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,280
reasons they exist is because of

190
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,370
American military intervention in the

191
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">first place that occurred in 2003 and</font>

192
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,340
left so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people disenfranchised</font>

193
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,410
destroyed cities like Fallujah was

194
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,690
almost entirely destroyed by the

195
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,970
military and now you see that was the

196
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,240
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraqi city to fall under Islamic</font>

197
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,700
state control more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a year ago so</font>

198
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,050
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

199
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,660
coincidences so your question is

200
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,630
extremely important and hopefully we'll

201
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">see political leaders start to make some</font>

202
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,900
very difficult but necessary decisions

203
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,910
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> given the plurality of all the</font>

204
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,040
leaders that exist within this Islamic

205
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,180
state and there are so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

206
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,660
types of groups how would a national

207
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,550
state actually decide who to negotiate

208
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,560
with well the Islamic state does seem to

209
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a very clear leadership structure</font>

210
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,330
at some point as they further formalize

211
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,370
themselves I imagine they would even

212
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,450
elect people to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Foreign</font>

213
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">Relations and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see them talking about</font>

214
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">issuing passports the Islamic state</font>

215
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,970
wants to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the trappings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

216
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,020
state so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly think they're there</font>

217
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,320
will be down the line intermediaries and

218
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,770
whether it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. his role is not</font>

219
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,660
necessarily direct negotiations but I

220
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,790
think some of the local actors will

221
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,710
certainly have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to engage with these</font>

222
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,090
people and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases already</font>

223
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,980
are engaged with these people the

224
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,770
Turkish government we managed to 350

225
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,600
hostages in Mosul from the Islamic state

226
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,150
so obviously there is communication

227
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,450
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright great thanks thank you</font>

228
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,340
real answer yeah thanks mix for coming

229
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,250
on so David um we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else I</font>

230
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,260
want you to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in skype and this</font>

231
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,520
is an aisle who's calling us from

232
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,730
Brooklyn so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say denial how's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

233
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,250
goin hey David how's it going nice try

234
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,370
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening on oh my question was does</font>

235
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,550
the ideology of Isis have legitimate

236
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,740
staying power in the region even if Isis

237
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,420
itself were to be defeated<font color="#E5E5E5"> like pretty</font>

238
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">soon unfortunately I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it does have</font>

239
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,540
resonance and that's because again of

240
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,030
this this massive disenfranchisement of

241
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,020
people by local governments by the

242
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,070
Syrian government

243
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,390
by the Iraqi government by the Egyptian

244
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,080
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the Libyan government and</font>

245
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,730
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> these powers are often backed by</font>

246
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,800
outside powers by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Western or European</font>

247
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,250
powers and that further drives<font color="#CCCCCC"> antipas e</font>

248
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,370
toward toward the west and and we see

249
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,310
Isis's<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the Islamic states ideology</font>

250
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,370
sort of building around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just</font>

251
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iraq being the most you know the most</font>

252
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,390
important example these areas where

253
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,820
you've seen the Islamic state become

254
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,370
very strong and actually take and hold

255
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,300
territory if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a map of where</font>

256
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,860
at one point the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was running the</font>

257
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,380
largest prison in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> in southern</font>

258
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Camp Bucca had nearly 30,000 people</font>

259
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,730
in it and if you looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

260
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,420
demographics they were very<font color="#CCCCCC"> heavily</font>

261
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,840
these people who the US was arresting in

262
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,780
mass arrests very heavily came from

263
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,700
these areas these are the people who

264
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been extremely extremely</font>

265
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,180
disenfranchised that's not my second

266
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,980
question thanks for that by the way my

267
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,690
second question is a little unrelated

268
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,380
and it's um what is Iran's role in Syria

269
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,830
considering their unique position as

270
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,520
opponents of Isis but allies of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Assad</font>

271
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,160
well Iran's position at this point

272
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,100
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the region their foreign policy</font>

273
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,700
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been for a long time to support</font>

274
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,240
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shiite Muslim militants</font>

275
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,560
across the region and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shiite</font>

276
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Muslim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> militants but but militants in</font>

277
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,960
general until the Arab<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spring and and</font>

278
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,220
we've seen this very defined split

279
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,170
between different groups around also

280
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,330
funded Hamas because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting</font>

281
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,730
against the Israeli government and now

282
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,500
you've seen that change a little bit um

283
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,740
so Iran's role in supporting the Syrian

284
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,530
government in supporting the Iraqi

285
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,660
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in supporting Hezbollah</font>

286
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,360
in Lebanon so if vechta ve<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ron is</font>

287
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,160
supporting people fighting the Islamic

288
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,310
state on three

289
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,370
different fronts their role has become

290
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,300
one of provocative because in some sense

291
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,279
supporter and provocateur because the

292
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Islamic state turns around and extreme</font>

293
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sona ideology labels Shiite Muslims as</font>

294
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,430
apostates and so the islamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> state says</font>

295
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,560
okay you don't want around here on is

296
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to increase its influence we have</font>

297
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,450
to fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> iran and it becomes kind of</font>

298
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,240
cyclical so iran's involvement and

299
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,980
supporting these<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments is kind of</font>

300
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,930
a catch-22 because in some ways it

301
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,200
catalyzes attacks on these same

302
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">governments what does that make sense</font>

303
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,790
does that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it def no it does it does</font>

304
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,290
and somewhat related is I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

305
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,040
analysts and pundits as of recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

306
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,140
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of claimed that Assad must fall in</font>

307
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,720
order to defeat Isis and what are your

308
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,570
thoughts on that do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's true</font>

309
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,380
well I think any binary in situations

310
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,410
like this is dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're with us or</font>

311
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,000
you're with the terrorists<font color="#E5E5E5"> no Assad does</font>

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,470
not need to fall to defeat Isis or to

313
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,640
defeat the Islamic state it's not an

314
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,160
either/or proposition what needs to

315
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,830
happen to defeat I couldn't actually say

316
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,420
what needs to happen to defeat the

317
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,339
Islamic state but but the idea that

318
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,450
Assad going is a precondition is is not

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,710
I think valid well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you appreciate</font>

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">it thank you yeah he'll thank you so</font>

321
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,839
much for coming on and so David we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

322
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,430
a bunch of tweets that are coming in

323
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,170
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start with this</font>

324
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,630
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justin sent us and he wants to</font>

325
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,670
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the Gulf states</font>

326
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,250
are tacitly supporting the Islamic state

327
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,390
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> our as a buffer against Ron</font>

328
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,680
that's an extremely difficult question

329
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,750
the Islamic state more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than any other</font>

330
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,300

331

doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in Mosul even before it</font>

340
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,740
effectively outright took it over there

341
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,010
are also more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than likely individual</font>

donations coming from the Gulf and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

343
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,350
countries although actually drawing a

344
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,900
line between any single government actor

345
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,870
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Islamic state is probably</font>

346
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,430
unlikely and extremely difficult mostly

347
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,550
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Islamic state also</font>

348
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,900
represents a threat to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government of</font>

349
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,300
Saudi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arabia to the government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Jordan</font>

350
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,950
and two other Arab governments certainly

351
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,560
though the Saudis do like the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

352
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,680
buffer<font color="#CCCCCC"> between them and Iran it was one</font>

353
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,080
reason that at one point they had decent

354
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,490
relations with Saddam Hussein and I

355
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,860
think they would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see probably</font>

356
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">more controllable or slightly more</font>

357
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,570
moderate groups in power at this point

358
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,770
as an alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Islamic state</font>

359
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,880
Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar are

360
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,599
effectively backing slightly more

361
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,750
moderate jihadi rebels who are very much

362
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,839
aligned and fight alongside al Qaeda and

363
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,609
even share their resources with them but

364
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,580
drawing a direct line between Gulf

365
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,560
states in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Islamic state i think is</font>

366
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,280
is quite difficult and probably a little

367
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,350
too simple for the complexity of the

368
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,930
situation cool so a<font color="#CCCCCC"> david you know we</font>

369
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,950
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are getting a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tweets</font>

370
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,440
while we're live right now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

371
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">are worth addressing we got this one</font>

372
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at um</font>

373
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,660
actually 2 i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you back to</font>

374
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,910
back and do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Islamic state</font>

375
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,680
is close to doing anything significant

376
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,380
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jordan and also we have Andrew who's</font>

377
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,520
asking if the fall of our an attack on

378
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,120
bag

379
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,550
is inevitable given what we've seen in

380
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,140
Ramadi recently so what do you think

381
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,580
about those two things what could happen

382
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,260
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jordan what might happen to back then</font>

383
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll start with the Baghdad question and</font>

384
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,850
an Islamic state push on Baghdad or an

385
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,950
effective campaign against Baghdad is

386
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,120
unlikely because of demographics<font color="#E5E5E5"> Baghdad</font>

387
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,520
in 2003 was probably about fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

388
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,760
some fifty percent Shiite<font color="#E5E5E5"> and often</font>

389
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,620
people didn't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their sex and</font>

390
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,850
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of intermarriage in the</font>

391
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,160
years after the invasion you saw most of

392
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sunnahs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being driven out of Baghdad</font>

393
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,190
and when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Islamic state made it its</font>

394
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,130
major offensive push last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year they were</font>

395
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,550
approaching down the road from northern

396
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,860
Iraq the main highway to Baghdad and

397
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,380
they were stopped outside Baghdad by a

398
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,280
mass mobilization of Shiite militiamen

399
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,800
and and that's what you would see in

400
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,940
Baghdad again if they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move on it</font>

401
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,260
they would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have extreme military</font>

402
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,210
superiority and then that just doesn't

403
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,630
seem like we based on the numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

404
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,550
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually rise up to</font>

405
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,320
defend Baghdad I think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

406
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,870
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for them to do it and not</font>

407
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,110
in their interest I think we'll see them

408
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,020
hold territory consolidate their hold on

409
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,200
uncertain territory and then it's more

410
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,880
likely they would move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Damascus</font>

411
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,400
before Baghdad<font color="#CCCCCC"> just simply because the</font>

412
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,890
Syrian<font color="#CCCCCC"> army seems to be rapidly falling</font>

apart in some parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country the</font>

414
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">question as far as Jordan and whether</font>

415
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,670
the Islamic state is close to doing

416
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,910
something in Jordan it's a really

417
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,040
popular thing to say oh this time the

418
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,840
Jordanian government is really in

419
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,620
trouble because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or that and the</font>

420
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,450
Jordanian government has been more<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

421
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,970
less stable although more or less

422
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,360
dependent on

423
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,140
military and humanitarian aid for its

424
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,809
survival but it's been stable for

425
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,299
decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have a very effective</font>

426
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:17,679
security service that has very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

427
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,020
managed to shut the border between

428
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,200
Jordan and Syria and and the Jordanian

429
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
government is aware of pretty much

430
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,120
anything coming or going over that

431
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,549
border I can't say certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

432
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,799
tipping point has been reached in Jordan

433
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,950
but I think the vast majority of

434
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,570
stakeholders in Jordan and in the

435
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jordanian government you know don't have</font>

436
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,510
any interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> in seeing this kind of an</font>

437
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,580
rest that's that's engulfed the other

438
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,710
countries and I don't think you'd see

439
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,620
Jordan we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about buffer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

440
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,020
Jordan is a buffer<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and I don't</font>

441
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,780
think I think you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> see pretty rapid</font>

American military<font color="#CCCCCC"> intervention possibly</font>

we've got another person<font color="#CCCCCC"> on skype let's</font>

you thank you good well my first

450
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,330
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an interview mr. Assad</font>

451
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,490
with CBS News an introvert service for

454
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,890
generally Isis has expanded more than

before Paul and John other interviews

Isis more than the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> America its</font>

459
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,320

serious about bombing Isis if will does

462
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,950
this make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of America</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

463

bare ground so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you serve other what was</font>

468
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:24,080
that Isis to<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance in romaji emporia</font>

469
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,359
well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing about the bombing</font>

470
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,499
campaign is that the US and other

471
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:33,539
governments have gone to lengths to

472
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,940
avoid civilian casualties civilian

473
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,489
casualties have still occurred but it is

474
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">partially that concern it keeps the</font>

was extremely good these tens of

thousands of airstrikes would have had a

took out an Isis offensive element or we

492
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,919
took out a an Isis vehicle that might

militants of questionable worth but

499
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,519
you're seeing them take out things at a

500
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,909
very slow pace and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's and the</font>

501
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,659
Islamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> state has built on the knowledge</font>

502
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,330
of its predecessor organization the

503
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,480
al-qaeda in Iraq which also fought the

US and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very familiar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with American</font>

where they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken out they move</font>

508
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,350
frequently so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all reasons why</font>

509
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,240
the air campaign

510
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,200
is not as effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> as maybe it could be</font>

511
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,210
it's also I think a lack of intelligence

512
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,179
when we're talking about afghan-pakistan

513
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,809
you've had at this point the US has and

514
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,700
they do get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at this as time goes</font>

515

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a decade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to build up</font>

516
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,400
intelligence assets and theoretically

517
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,040
they have some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the ground who</font>

518
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,929
are helping them with those strikes

519
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:53,250
whereas I as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as intelligence on the</font>

520
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,350
ground a lot of the areas controlled by

world again if America was serious about

users well that's a really great

533
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,070
question um and it's a question that

534
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,440
needs to be posed to the Turkish

535
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,480
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is very much complicit</font>

536
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,850
in the rise of the Islamic state by

537
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,990
allowing material and fighters to cross

538
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:48,990
the Turkish border with very little the

539
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,850
Turks have made it very easy to cross

540
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,720
and the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> has criticized</font>

541
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,850
them certainly behind the scenes and

542
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,790
once even openly they've got six months

543
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vice president actually</font>

544
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">complained about this on television and</font>

545
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,309
very quickly retracted what he had said

546
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:12,330
the US needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> Turkey as an ally or wants</font>

547
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,750
Turkey as an ally and is trying not to

548
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,760
offend them turkey also has an interest

549
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,030
in allowing fighters into Syria because

550
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,750
of their disagreements with the Assad

551
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,270
government and in return Assad has

552
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,260
helped helped build up Kurdish militants

553
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,990
along the Turkish<font color="#CCCCCC"> border which has</font>

554
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,260
increased<font color="#E5E5E5"> tension further</font>

555
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,149
in in large part this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an issue with</font>

556
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:43,210
the Turkish government<font color="#E5E5E5"> who could be far</font>

557
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,659
far more effective in patrolling their

558
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:49,690
border and in keeping people from

559
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,210
crossing and joining Isis I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

560
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,070
the Islamic stay that's that's the major

561
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,940

569
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,880
a simple question why don't we work with

570
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,970
Assad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to destroy the Islamic state that</font>

571
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,149
is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question um we actually have a</font>

572
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:25,779
clip from a video that went live on vice

573
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:28,960
news this week shot by one of our

574
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,169

581
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,110
my suggestion would figure if I'm

identity to get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that Jesus</font>

583
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,340
comedies on because we don't bloody knee

584
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:32,060
have you seen more so that clip we just

585
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,240
saw was filmed in northern Syria a

586
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,580
couple weeks ago and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically</font>

587
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">al-qaeda fighters looking at what</font>

588
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">appears to be evidence of a Syrian</font>

589
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,030
military massacre of prisoners before

590
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,110
they fled that base and that is a scene

591
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me is very hard to watch and I</font>

592
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,700
would imagine for many of our viewers is

593
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,240
is very off-putting for Syrians that is

594
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,830
a very common scene we've seen a lot of

595
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,410
attention paid to Islamic state

596
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,530
atrocities<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mass killings we've seen</font>

597
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,720
much less focus in the last couple years

598
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,080
on the atrocities and the mass killings

599
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,410
committed by the Syrian government so if

600
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,310
the US were to come in on the side of

601
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,880
Assad they're essentially picking an

602
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,410
actor who is in his tactics not that

603
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">much different from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Islamic state</font>

604
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,570
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crimes that have been committed</font>

605
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,660
by the Syrian government are one of the

606
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,330
reasons the Islamic state has support

607
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,480
and why people are sometimes supportive

608
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,310
of these atrocities rather than appalled

609
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,980
by them but thank you for the question

610
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,140
it's one that's come up a lot especially

611
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,360
with an American

612
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,850
politics yeah and it's an important

613
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,309
question to answer so David thanks for
