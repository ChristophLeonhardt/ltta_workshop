earlier this year there were a few rounds back in fourths of a proposed tariffs between the US and China Donald Trump finally getting to make good on his decades-long vendetta against China a whether real or perceived and some of the tariffs were actually put in a place some are implied that they will go into effect at some point we've put in tariffs against some of their goods they've done the same it's already started to hurt a few industries including a soybeans in the US and now it's going even farther and it's not just against China Trump is hitting the EU Canada and Mexico with a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum sent to the United States starting Friday now of course China is subject to the tariffs as well but the EU and Canada send far more metal to the United States and so the penalties will have a much larger impact on them for example I believe that Canada is the single largest exporter to us of these types of metals about six times as much as China is so if he's sticking a thumb in the eye of China he's sticking a whole handful of eyes and figures in the Trudeau's eyes right now over that and yes so they're not happy about it Trudeau and others are now responding here is Trudeau without Canada's position on the matter these tariffs are totally unacceptable that Canada could be considered a national security threat to the United States is inconceivable these tariffs will harm industry and workers on both sides of the canada-us border these tariffs are an affront to the long-standing security partnership between Canada and the United States and in particular an affront to the thousands of Canadians who have fought and died alongside their American brothers in arms' been very clear that my interactions with President Trump have been clear and firm we have always an indeed he he has always understood that I will and do stand up for Canadian interests in Canadian Canadian workers this decision by the US administration will hurt Canadians it will hurt Americans and we regret that deeply now of course the tariffs against them or that's trouble for Canada but it turns out you know there's actually something these other countries can do in response it's never been tried before they can set up tariffs against us you know and it looks like they're actually going to do that here is Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland talking about Canada's likely counter actions you're imposing dollar-for-dollar tariffs for every dollar levied against Canadians by the US we are today beginning a 15 day consultation period with Canadians so that they may express their support for or concerns about the proposed countermeasures and the lists of goods this is sixteen point six billion dollars of retaliation this is the strongest trade action Canada has taken in the post-war era if you've been paying attention you can probably understand or predict what's gonna happen next Trump's gonna get pissed off at what they did add some new tariffs they will feel obligated to do the same we've seen this play out historically before and before I throw it to the panel I just want to contextualize these counteractions a little bit because saying we're gonna put tariffs on steel and aluminum for most regular people that doesn't really mean anything it will affect you you know you don't buy steel beams but aluminum goes into the cars you buy cans you purchase all sorts of appliances and things like that but the EU also is responding and the EU of economic regulatory commission met and has an eight-page list of things they will then be putting tariffs on that includes things like Harley Davidsons canoes manicure or pedicure preparations sinks and wash basins of stainless steel as well as orange juice pork cheese whiskey blue jeans any number of different products which means that if you're living in the Rust Belt you may say look at Trump he's standing up for us steel is gonna be a little bit more expensive to export to us and then the products that you make when you try to sell them abroad as we do as a country you will now sell less of it there will less demand for American goods because of these obvious reactions from the EU Canada Mexico and related countries so China is coming next and this is about 12 to 16 billion dollars as they explained and from Canada retaliating the Chinese are talking about 200 billion dollars with that we would do them and they would do to us in retaliation so but I want to stay on a Canada for one second because Trump tweeted out they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers they report a really high surplus on trade with us and of course as usual that's not true you would think that he would accidentally get some things right right and on the issue of the trade surplus like we have a trade deficit with almost everyone so it's like shooting fish in a barrel the one country we don't have a deficit with is Canada we actually betrayed surplus with Canada of 12 and a half billion dollars and he got that wrong he got the one country wrong so but in an earlier interaction he had bragged about Trudeau came in here and he said they've got a surplus with us that we have a surplus with them and I made it up that we don't I told them we have a deficit I made it up why are you bragging about that what a weirdo you are what a strange strange man you are and and what is that what is the point of that story what does it prove other than the fact that you're a pathological liar and you know they could just look it up right you know they're not can I just take your word for it and be like yeah oh okay I guess we got us got deficit fine you win what kind of guess he's used to making like these backroom deals like oh yeah I'll give you that if you give me this and then you lie about it and now the guy doesn't find out you're the president they're gonna find out all right but I'm super curious what you guys think about the trade overall and and and and some of these sanctions that are being not anxious but obviously tariffs that are being put into place yeah well obviously this is all ridiculous but what's a shame is that it also distracts from the medium and long term issue and is our trade agreements are broken yeah the fix isn't imposing tariffs the fix is negotiating on behalf of workers rights so that there's reciprocity because our workers are getting the short end of the stick right now because we're trading with countries that allow in many cases slave labor that don't have appropriate human rights enforcement and labor practices so our workers are at a disadvantage what we ought to be doing with our power around the world is not imposing crazy tariffs that lead to war but rather advocating for more human rights for more workers rights so that if you want to enter into a trade agreement with the United States you have to Accord your workers the rights that our workers have so there's an even playing field and you know this situation actually if you draw it up over a long period of time is in part owned by the corporate Democrats the universe of pores vacuum right and for the last 30 years there has nothing there has not been a counter to the obsession and religion with unfettered global trade corporate Democrats and Republicans have all been for the same issue which is no hard negotiating and trade deals which has left our workers sold down the river competing with countries that don't protect their own workers right and so I think our responsibility is as Democrats to advance a progressive trade agenda that's based on equalizing workers rights and human rights around the world and maybe this is an opportunity with people are paying attention to the question of trade or we can start raising that issue yeah I just want to say how prophetic that South Park movie actually was you know we're gonna have this war with Canada with Eric Cartman as president and now it just makes no sense of course because Trump most of the things that he does make no sense except to him so this is I feel like this is a social and personality pathology that's happening where he's just want to isolate himself from everybody and everything obviously we need international solutions to international problems one of the things that this hurts the most is the United States solar industry which is a thirty percent already a thirty percent tariff on on solar panels well we need Chinese solar panels to solve the global problem of climate change which of course Trump unilaterally withdrawing us from the Paris Accords as well so this I just think he likes to act on his own even if it's in no one's interest at all just to make this this kind of trouble and what's really unfortunate in this and in this week is that it makes Justin Bieber I mean Justin Trudeau look good at a time when he just nationalized the Canadian tar sands industry well not the energy but the pipelines yeah and became an oil tycoon and shouldn't look good about anything right now the whole international community should be coming together to roundly condemn Justin Trudeau's action against you know pipeline activists against the environment against First Nations in Canada that those pipelines were going are going to run through their territories and nobody wants that except for the oil industry so right now it's this a massive distraction from something that that the Justin Trudeau did that is really horrible yeah and so I want everybody understand that the things are not binary like that you either say yes to the corporate trade deals or you say let's do a trade war no that's does no not your only two options and it makes a difference if the president is intelligent or not and it makes a difference if the president cares about your interests or not so I think Joe is exactly right there's a way to negotiate these deals that is better for you guys so when when Trump said that on the campaign trail it made sense and and it appealed to people because their wages are so low when they saw their jobs being shipped out I always go back to Nick Smith he's the guy we interviewed local organizer comes from coal mining family in western virginia and starts the interview during the 2016 campaign with saying i ain't nothin but a white-trash hillbilly from the holler but here's what i know okay and he said look at least trump had the decency to lie to us and the corporate democrats have been saying all along no there's no hope for you it's all status quo we're gonna give everything to the corporations and the by the way too don't get me wrong as a corporate republicans fully agree so this is a one issue not on racism not on anything else this is the one issue that they're standing up to trump on so they're say wait a minute my corporate donor is also won unfettered trade that is trade deals organized and written by corporations because that's their donors for corporate Republicans and Democrats so if you're angry at the establishment you're right unfortunately we went in the wrong direction as to how to take out that anger because now you're not gonna get any help your products are gonna be more expensive and you're not gonna get your jobs back and we're gonna start a trade war instead of saying hey instead of the corporation's writing those deals why don't the people of the United States and Canada and the European Union write those deals where we actually care about each other's workers and lift up those standards together instead of fighting each other senselessly and driving up prices and losing jobs and wouldn't it wouldn't it be amazing if at the same time that we're helping to use the the comparison between our workers and workers in Vietnam or China or wherever to try to raise them up to our level if the EU could also elbow us a little bit to get our workers rights level up to theirs yeah would that be amazing eventually maybe like the Vietnamese will be like look you guys got to help your workers seriously yes unfortunately we might get to that point it's a much bigger issue here though I think that is fascinating because when you do this it's clear that there is no such thing as a free market you know all these Republicans and conservatives for using all of the free market oh this is what we have to have you know no our economy is created it's created by our tax policies it's created by the ways that we incorporate encourage you know corporations to just you know basically extract things out of the earth and then rape and pillage the environment and do that without actually any kind of negative impacts on the bottom business bottom line right but what this shows is that you could use government policy to actually create better things for working people for better things for poor people better things for the environment instead this is just sort of a weird lashing out that Trump always does but it it's out the fact that what a lot of people Robert Reich and others have been saying for for many many years there is no free market our economies are rigged and they're rigged to benefit the wealthiest among us and we could in fact intervene in the way that capitalism works and do it in all sorts of ways it would help people course we're doing it in ways that you know hurt most people in this case with Donald Trump but it just shows that there's that philosophy of oh never touch the the free market is a complete and utter lie and it's been a lie for decades what's even worse is that the only times Democrats and Republicans want to touch the free markets are when companies need help right but when workers need help right or just people is this gonna hurt poor people in America it's gonna hurt poor people in those countries when you know aluminum cans prices go up and all the basic prices of all these goods go up for the poorest people in America that's going to be an extra tax on those folks because that trade gap of course you know unfettered free global capitalism which the WTO is now complaining about this also hurts people that hurts people in other ways so of course there's no such thing as on federer capitalism Adam Smith talked about how you need regulation of course you can't have monopolies otherwise I would come into effect right away anyone who's ever studied economic systems knows that and it's just marketing by them in fact we don't have unfettered capitalism or anywhere near it now partly because we have gigantic crony capitalism so the top 200 corporate givers to into politics receive back four point four trillion dollars in subsidies where's your free markets there's no free markets no they they buy off our politicians through private financing of Elections and then they have crony capitalism where the wealthy get more wealthy and the powerful get more powerful and the rest of us suffer and then they bring in a clown from a reality show to distract you and do some juggling and say oh I started a trade war that sounds tough it's not gonna help you at all but are you distracted enough and that's exactly what's happening now to Easy wastefully Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are
