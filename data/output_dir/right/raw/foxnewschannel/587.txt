MEETING.

197
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,575
SOUNDS LIKE A SET-UP TO ME.

198
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:04,610
AND BECAUSE SIMPSON'S

199
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,412

210
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:34,473
THAT'S RIGHT.

211
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:35,641
IT'S ALL LITERALLY

212
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,612
IT SOUNDS.

213
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,214
BUT, WHERE IS THE HYSTERIA

214
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,182
FROM THE MEDIA?

215
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,886
LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

216
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,722
WITH PHONY RUSSIAN

217
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:50,956
INFORMATION THAT IS PAID FOR

218
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,958

222
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,795
WHERE IS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

223
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:57,229

224
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,630
OH, IT'S NOT REALLY AN

225
00:06:58,631 --> 00:06:59,898
INVESTIGATION INTO COLLUSION

226
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:00,632
NOW, IS IT?

227
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:01,967
IT'S A PARTISAN WITCH-HUNT

228
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:05,504
AMERICAN PEOPLE, HAVE SEEN

229
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,172
THROUGH THIS AND HAVE HAD

230
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:07,606
ENOUGH.

231
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,575
EVEN FAKE NEWS CNN HAS A

232
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:10,843
POLL THAT SHOWS, THAT'S

233
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:11,910

00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:19,551
AND THIS COMES AS THE TRIAL

244
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:20,786
OF THE CENTURY MAY BE COMING

245
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:21,987
TO AN END.

246
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,121
AFTER 11 DAYS THE DEFENSE

247
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,456
RESTED IN THE BANK AND TAX

248
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,491
FRAUD CASE OF PAUL MANAFORT

249
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:27,559
FROM 2005.

250
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,161
THEY DIDN'T BOTHER CALLING A

251
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:30,429
SINGLE WITNESS.

252
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,763
MANAFORT'S LEGAL TIME

253
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:32,464
APPARENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE

254
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:34,166
SPECIAL COUNSEL DID NOT MEET

255
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,167
THEIR BURDEN.

256
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:35,967
THE BURDEN OF PROOF.

257
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,736
AND THEY MAY BE RIGHT.

258
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,604
ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS FROM A

259
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:40,605
NORTHERN VIRGINIA CRIMINAL

260
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:41,506
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, TEAM

261
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,542
MUELLER WAS NOT READY FOR

262
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:45,844
PRIME TIME IN JUDGE ELLIS'

263
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:46,545
COURTROOM.

264
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:47,813
QUOTE:  NO MATTER HOW STRONG

265
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:48,680
THEIR EVIDENCE.

266
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,648
HOW RIGHTEOUS THEIR CAUSE,

267
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,250
HOW IMPRESSIVE THEIR RESUMES

268
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,618
MAY BE AND ACTUALLY ARE,

269
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,654
THEY SIMPLY HAVE NOT DONE A

270
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,189
VERY GOOD JOB.

271
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,190
CLEARLY MUELLER WAS TRYING

272
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,691
TO TURN THE SCREWS ON

273
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:01,126
MANAFORT AS JUDGE ELLIS TOLD

274
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,661
US, HE NEVER WANTED TO GO TO

275
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:02,961
TRIAL.

276
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,396
HE JUST WANTED MANAFORT TO

277
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,298
SING OR TO COMPOSE SO THAT

278
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:07,232
MUELLER COULD GIVE UP

279
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,967
SOMETHING OR MAKE UP

280
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,169
SOMETHING, ANYTHING, TO THEN

281
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,671
PROSECUTE OR IMPEACH DONALD

282
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:12,971
TRUMP.

283
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,906
AND DESPITE TEAM MUELLER'S

284
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:16,875
POOR PERFORMANCE IN COURT.

285
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:20,979
THE VAST MAJORITY OF FEDERAL

286
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,347
CASE RESULT IN A GUILTY

287
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:23,515
VERDICT, OVER 90%.

288
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,317
THIS CASE, FOR THE RECORD,

289
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,652
AND MANE WE'LL GET EVEN AS

290
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:29,454
EARLY AS THURSDAY OF THIS

291
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:30,255
WEEK, A VERDICT.

292
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:34,759
DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.

293
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,661
NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA,

294
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:37,862
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

295
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,264
ELECTION AT ALL.

296
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,999
ROD ROSENSTEIN'S MANDATE

297
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,935
AND MEANWHILE, WHAT DO WE

298
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:44,235
HAVE?

299
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:46,237
HILLARY CLINTON COMMITTING

300
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,972
MULTIPLE, SERIOUS FELONIES,

301
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:48,873
CRIMES?

302
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:49,941
MISHANDLING TOP SECRET

303
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:50,342
INFORMATION?

304
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:51,710
SHE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE WHEN

305
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:57,849
WATCHED HER HARD DRIVES WITH

306
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,317
BLEACH BIT, WATCHED THEM

307
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:00,385
AWAY SO THEY COULD NEVER BE

308
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:00,952
FOUND AGAIN.

309
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:02,520
BROKE UP HER DEVICES WITH

310
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:02,954
HAMMERS.

311
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:03,988
FIXED AND RIG AN

312
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,757
INVESTIGATION WITH STEELE'S

313
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,391
DIRTY DOSSIER.

314
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:07,459
REMEMBER, THAT WAS FULL OF

315
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,260
RUSSIAN LIES AND PEDALED TO

316
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:10,528
YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

317
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:10,795
WHY?

318
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:12,864
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO

319
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,599
MISINFORM YOU, TO STEAL AN

320
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:14,966
ELECTION.

321
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,268
THAT'S CALLED PROPAGANDA.

322
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,736
MISINFORMATION.

323
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:20,739
AND THAT INFORMATION WAS

324
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,308
THEN PRESENTED TO FOUR

325
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:26,911
EVIDENCE.

326
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:28,713
NOBODY HAD EVER LITERALLY

327
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:29,948
VERIFIED ANY OF IT,

328
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,482
CORROBORATED ANY OF IT.

329
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:33,718
NOBODY HAS BEEN INDICTED,

330
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,553
INVESTIGATED BY TEAM MUELLER

331
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,423
REGARDING CLINTON'S DIRTY

332
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:39,324
RUSSIAN DOSSIER.

333
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,558
THIS IS A DISGRACE TO

334
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,726
AMERICA'S SYSTEM OF JUSTICE.

335
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,432
IT IS A CLEAR AND DANGER --

336
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,701
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO

337
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:50,869
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC.

338
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,938
MAKE NO MISTAKE, MANAFORT IS

339
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:54,405
FOUND GUILTY?

340
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,376
STORMY, STORMY, STORMY.

341
00:09:58,377 --> 00:09:59,944
BLANK HOLE, BLANK HOLE,

342
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:01,579
BLANK HOLE, RUSSIA, RUSSIA,

343
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,380
RUSSIA, RUSSIA.

344
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,717
FORCED TO CALL THEM OUT FOR

345
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:10,488
THEIR SHAMELESS, PRICELESS

346
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:10,855
PEDDLING.

347
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:11,522
YES, JOURNALISM IN AMERICA

348
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,557
IS DEAD.

349
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:13,758
BUT THE REAL FEAR OUGHT TO

350
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,659
BE WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A

351
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,127
JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT APPLIES

352
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:18,162
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW,

353
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,430
EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR

354
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:19,730
LAWS.

355
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:20,865
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT RUSSIA,

356
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,567
WHY ARE WE DEALING WITH A

357
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,435
2005 TAX CASE NOT RELATED TO

358
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:25,570
THE CAMPAIGN OR RUSSIA OR

359
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,408
THE DIRTY DOSSIER WITH

360
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,210
RUSSIAN LIES THAT ABOUT

361
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,244
PEDDLED TO THE AMERICAN

362
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:33,578
PEOPLE?

363
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,780
WHY AREN'T WE INVESTIGATING

364
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:38,683
FISA COURT JUDGES THAT WERE

365
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:39,717
ABSOLUTELY, A FRAUD WAS PER

366
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,488
WHAT ABOUT ADAM SCHIFF?

367
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,390
SHIFT J SCHIFF AND HE IS

368
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:47,692

AND COMPANY AT TRUMP TOWER

374
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,109
