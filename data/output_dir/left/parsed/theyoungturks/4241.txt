NOW THAT DONALD TRUMP
IS THE PRESIDENT, HOW IS THE GUN
INDUSTRY RESPONDING?
THERE HAS
BEEN A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER
OF SALES FOR THE GUN INDUSTRY.
THE DIFFERENCE IS PRETTY STARK.
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, SHARES OF
GUN MAKER RGR DOWN AS MUCH AS
9% AFTER REPORTING RESULTS
WEDNESDAY THAT MISSED
EXPECTATIONS.
IN THE SECOND
QUARTER SALES WERE DOWN 22%
AGAINST THE SAME PERIOD LAST
YEAR WHILE PROFITS FELL A TOTAL
OF 53%.
WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE IN
OFFICE IT IS GREAT BUSINESS FOR
GUN MANUFACTURERS BECAUSE THERE
IS THIS FEAR OF GUN REGULATION,
GUN CONTROL.
SINCE THEY ARE
WORRIED ABOUT IT THEY WILL GO
OUT AND BUY GUNS 
AND STOCKPILE.
THEY ARE VERY WELL AWARE THAT
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT NECESSARILY
GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
>> IT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY
ARE NOT AS AFRAID UNDER TRUMP,
BUT ALSO DURING THE ELECTION
THAT IS WHEN THEY WERE DOING ALL
THE PROPAGANDA.
PEOPLE PANICKED
AND STOCKPILED.
THEN THAT MEANS
THEY ALSO HAVE LESS MONEY TO
BUY ALL THEIR GUNS NOW.
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY SALES
ARE GOING DOWN.
>> KEEP IN MIND THE NRA ENDORSED
AS POLITICIANS, THEY ENDORSED
DONALD TRUMP.
THE NRA IS ALSO
VERY CLOSELY TIED TO THESE GUN
MANUFACTURERS.
GUN MANUFACTURERS
FUND THE NRA, WHICH IS WHY IT IS
A POWERFUL LOBBYING GROUP.
I WAS
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THEY DO TO
MAKE UP FOR SLUGGISH SALES.
THIS
QUOTE KIND OF GIVES YOU A SENSE
OF WHAT THEIR MENTALITY IS AND
WHAT THEIR MARKETING STRATEGY
IS.
THIS IS BASED ON THE CEO OF
RGR.
IT IS 
THIS CYCLE OF
PARANOIA.
MORE PARANOIA LEADS TO
MORE PEOPLE BUYING GUNS, MORE
GUNS LEAD TO MORE VIOLENCE,
WHICH LEAD TO MORE COPS FEELING
PARANOID.
IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE.
IT'S FASCINATING TO SEE AT WORK.
>>IT'S FASCINATING FOR HIM TO
ADMIT IT.
IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN
INTO HUMAN TERMS IT IS
INCREDIBLY GROSS.
HE IS SAYING
BASICALLY COPS ARE AFRAID THAT
YOU HAVE A GUN, SO THEY ARE MORE
LIKELY TO SHOOT, THAT MAKES
PEOPLE SAY BACK OFF.
HE THEN
CLAIMS THAT NOW CRIME IS RUNNING
RAMPANT BECAUSE OF THAT.
THERE
IS NO PROOF OF THAT.
THAT MAKES
A VIDEO ELSE NERVOUS.
BUT IT IS
GOOD NEWS FOR US BECAUSE IT
DRIVES DEMAND AS LONG AS
EVERYBODY IS AFRAID.
BUT THE
FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE IS
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.
WHAT WE SEE
TO BE A VICIOUS CYCLE, NEW
SHOOTERS, THEN PEOPLE GET WORD
AND GRAB THEIR GUNS OR BUY NEW
GUNS AND THEN THERE ARE MORE
SHOOTINGS BECAUSE OF THAT.
IF
YOU ARE A GUN MAKER, THAT IS A
VIRTUOUS CYCLE.
THAT LEADS TO
MORE PROFITS.
BUT AS THE CEO
BASICALLY ADMITTING THAT IT IS
GOOD NEWS.
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE
HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM
THOUGH.
LAST YEAR THERE WAS
LITERALLY ONE MASS SHOOTING
WHERE FOUR PEOPLE WERE SHOT
EVERY DAY.
ON THE OTHER HAND
THEY ARE LIKE THIS 
IS GREAT.
>>TO BE FAIR DEMOCRATS KIND OF
PROPOSE GUN LEGISLATION.
>> BY THE WAY LEGISLATION THAT
AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF GUN
OWNERS AGREE WITH.
73% OF NRA
MEMBERS AGREE WITH THE
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PROPOSED BY
THE DEMOCRATS DURING OBAMA.
BUT
THE NRA GETS MOST OF THEIR
FUNDING FROM GUN MANUFACTURERS.
CRIME LEADS TO MORE PARANOIA
WHICH LEADS TO MORE GUN SALES.
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH CRIME.
>>WHEN I AM CURIOUS ABOUT IS ñ
EVEN THE MAJORITY OF NRA MEMBERS
ARE IN FAVOR OF CLOSING THE
LOOPHOLES TO ENSURE THAT GUYS
DON'T GET ACCESS TO GUNS.
HOW
COME EVERY TIME THERE IS ANY
TYPE OF DEBATE OR DISCUSSION IT
IMMEDIATELY DEVOLVES INTO TWO
INSANELY POLARIZED GROUPS THAT
REFUSE TO SEE THE PERSPECTIVES
OF ONE ANOTHER.
I AM NOT IN
FAVOR OF BANNING GUNS.
I'M IN
FAVOR OF THE BACKGROUND CHECKS,
CLOSING THINGS LIKE GUN SHOW
LOOPHOLES.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
I AM ALSO VERY WELL AWARE OF HOW
THE NRA IS FUNDED, HOW THEY ARE
CORRUPTED BY GUN MANUFACTURERS,
HOW IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH
PROFIT.
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE
HARD-CORE GUN ADVOCATES ARE YOU
AT LEAST ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT?
>>I THINK THE 27% ñ IT'S NOT
LIKE THEY DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT,
THEY ARE SUPER FIRM.
THEY HAVE
BEEN RILED UP FOR THE PROFIT OF
OTHERS.
IF YOU PROPOSE
LEGISLATION WHERE YOU KNOW WHO
BOUGHT THE GUN AND THEY ARE NOT
MENTALLY DERANGED OR A FELON
THAT WILL LEAD TO ñ IF YOU HAVE
A TERRORIST WATCH LIST AND WE
DON'T LET TERRORISTS BUY GUNS
NEXT THING YOU KNOW WE WON'T LET
CITIZENS BUY GUNS.
THE SLIPPERY
SLOPE SLIDES BOTH WAYS.
THAT IS
PRETTY EXTREME ALREADY.
BUT THEN
YOU CAN SAY WE SHOULD LET THE
PEOPLE ON THE TERRORIST WATCH
LIST BY BAZOOKAS.
THE SLIPPERY
SLOPE SLIDES BOTH WAYS.
BUT THEY
DON'T HEAR THAT.
THE REASON THEY
THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS
A SOPHISTICATED PROPAGANDA
CAMPAIGN DONE TO DRIVE GUN
SALES.
BUT I DO ENJOY THE IRONY
OF THEM SUPPORTING REPUBLICANS
AND FINDING OUT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY
SHOT THEMSELVES IN 
THE FOOT.
