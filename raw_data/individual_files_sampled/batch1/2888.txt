Gutzon Borglum was a sculptor who created Mount Rushmore he was worried that over time his work would lose significant so we plan to add a room behind Abraham Lincoln's hairline called the Hall of Records federal funders didn't think it was worth the expense but the idea was eventually approved however Borglum was asked to focus on the sculpture first he died in 1941 after working on Mount Rushmore for 14 years but the Hall of Records was still unfinished so his family petitioned the government to complete it it was finally approved in 1998 porcelain tablets were added to the room that explained the work done on the mountain and contained important American documents it was then sealed in a titanium bolt the room is still inaccessible to tourists
