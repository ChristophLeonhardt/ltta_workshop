HOWIE: BILL COSBY'S RETRIAL WAS GETTING LITTLE ATTENTION UNTIL A VERDICT WAS ANNOUNCED. BILL COSBY HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES AGAINST HIM. WE ARE UNDER KAITD, VALIDATED, AND WE ARE NOW PART OF THE TSUNAMI OF WOMEN, POWER AND JUSTICE. WE ARE NOT SHUTTING UP, AND WE ARE NOT GOING AWAY. GET OVER IT. I THANK YOU ALL IN THE MEDIA. YOU ARE THE PILLARS OF DEMOCRACY. WITHOUT YOU NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. HOWIE: JOINING US IS CARLEY SHIMKUS. THERE HAS BEEN ALMOST A UNIVERSAL MEDIA COVERAGE OF THIS. WHAT MAKES THIS SUCH A CULTURAL MOMENT? CARLEY: SYMBOLICALLY THIS TRIAL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BILL COSBY IS THE FIRST FAMOUS MAN TO BE FOUND GUILTY OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FOLLOWING THE #metoo MOVEMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY REGARDLESS. BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND KEVIN SPACEY WAS IN THE BACK OF THEIR MINDS. HOWIE: HE WASN'T FOUND GUILTY THE LAST TIME. THERE WAS A DIFFERENT THIS TIME. IT'S A DIFFERENT CLIMATE. BUT ALSO THERE WAS SEVERAL OTHER COSBY ACCUSERS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AS OPPOSED TO JUST ANDREA CONSTAND WHO WAS THE FOCUS OF THE PROSECUTION. CARLEY: THE D.A. CALLED THOSE WOMEN THE DIFFERENCE MAKERS. PROSECUTORS COULD CREATE THE NARRATIVE THAT ANDREA CONSTAND WAS PART OF A BEHAVIOR COSBY USED. COSBY USED A DIFFERENT LEGAL TEAM WHERE THEY ATTACKED THE WITNESSES. SUGGESTING ANDREA CONSTAND WASSED A GOLD DURING AND CALLING ANOTHER WITNESS AS A WOMAN WHO SLEPT AROUND. HOWIE: AN HAD MADE A SETTLEMENT WITH ANDREA CONSTAND. THERE WAS LITTLE ATTENTION, WAS THAT BECAUSE IT WAS SEEN AS OLD NEWS OR WAS IT A MISJUDGMENT BY THE PRESS. CARLEY: THERE IS SO MUCH NEWS COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON. THIS IS A RETRIAL. ALSO BILL COSBY IS 80 YEARS OLD, HE'S IN POOR HEALTH. HIS LEGACY HAS ALREADY BEEN DESTROYED. THE IMPACT OF A GUILTY VERDICT IS MUCH LESS THAN AT THE PEAK OF HIS CAREER. HOWIE: LOOKING AT THIS, I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY TO THINK THAT THIS IS NOW THE PRECEDENT FOR OTHER KINDS OF CASES WHEN IT MAY BE RATHER UNIQUE TO COSBY AS OPPOSED TO WHEN YOU HAVE A DEFENDANT WHO IS NOT PARTICULARLY FAMOUS. CARLEY: I DO THINK EVERY TRIAL WILL BE JUDGED FAIRLY AND EQUALLY. PEOPLE CALL THIS A PRECEDENT. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE THAT CASE. BUT I'M SURE HARVEY WEINSTEIN DID LOOK AT THIS VERDICT. THERE ARE SO MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN IN HOW OFTEN THEY USED THEIR POWER TO ASSAULT WOMEN.
