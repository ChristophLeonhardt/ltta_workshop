16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,180
foreclosure you need to another source

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find so we try and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it easy for</font>

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,020
people that are interested in buying

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,760
foreclosure properties to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,949

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,030
sale so throughout the downturn this

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,129
past year has<font color="#E5E5E5"> your value proposition had</font>

24
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,620
to evolve or change to meet new consumer

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,650
demand or it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've evolved</font>

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,030
but not in the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody really</font>

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,700
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expected we as the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,280
foreclosures have gone up and is that

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,869
has had an effect on the overall economy

30
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,090
we've actually found fewer people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,320
are able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy so our marketplace has</font>

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,810
changed a little bit from<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,840
first-time homebuyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and real estate</font>

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,009
adopt our service<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit to</font>

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,100
change with the customer base so has the

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,200
doubter made you more relevant or just

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,450
had to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evolved from where you</font>

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">were two years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think as a source</font>

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
of reliable information we're probably

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,979
more relevant than we've ever been and

43
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,470
probably will continue to be until we're

44
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,390
through with this crisis in terms of

45
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,009
who's interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how much buying</font>

46
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,619
activity is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a slow</font>

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:56,939
market<font color="#E5E5E5"> for everybody in the real estate</font>

48
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,399
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now so I was brushing up</font>

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,259
yesterday and the foreclosure market is

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,380
pretty complex what sort of tools do you

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,409
provide the average user user well it it

52
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,780
is a complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and that's a real</font>

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,280
critical point is that it's a process

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,530
not not

55
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,990
just an activity so we help people

56
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,490
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stage of foreclosure</font>

57
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,000
properties and we help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them figure out</font>

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what's owed on the property versus</font>

59
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,650
what the property is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually worth try</font>

60
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,360
and get some photography of the of the

61
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,740
home so they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a look at what</font>

62
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,180
they're dealing with it will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

63
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,650
them a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of trending information so</font>

64
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,360
they can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the average sales</font>

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,069
price of foreclosure properties or other

66
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,390
types of properties are in a

67
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,069
neighborhood but really give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

68
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,660
the tools that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give them that</font>

69
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,880
will help them analyze the the condition

70
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,950
the value the the potential of a

71
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,900
property and actually give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

72
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to connect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with local real</font>

73
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,840
estate professionals who can help them

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,970
in the transaction so you fostered a

75
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,920
sense of community<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your user base</font>

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,019
and and others<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

77
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,180
community to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site a little more</font>

78
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,760
sticky yeah it's interesting we've

79
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,530
pulled in multiple data sources data

80
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,090
streams that sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> merge them all</font>

81
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,400
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a I guess you know the</font>

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,950
cliche is a web 2.0 sort of environment

83
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,440
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really what we wanted to do was</font>

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,720
to give the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user the control so if they</font>

85
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to if they want to try and do this</font>

86
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,090
by themselves we're going to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

87
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,440
all tools they need if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,030
or somebody else we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

89
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier for them to find somebody else</font>

90
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's caused us to create training</font>

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,120
programs real estate professionals

92
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,019
because it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out they didn't know a</font>

93
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:25,160
whole lot about the foreclosure market

94
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,780
either and if they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help our</font>

95
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,790
customers they need to be educated so

96
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,079
switching gears a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

97
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,790
advertising obviously took a beating

98
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,709
last year how has that held up on your

99
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,510
site actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing much better</font>

100
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,970
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> most and and it's because our our</font>

101
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,540
user base is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> active community so</font>

102
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have partnerships with companies like</font>

103
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,269
Lowe's who are interested in prospects

104
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,120
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to rehabilitate houses</font>

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,290
we're apparently one of their best

106
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,690
performing advertising sources right now

107
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,660
and since we typically am only for

108
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,209
relevant advertising content we've

109
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,640
weathered that storm pretty well so

110
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,530
making advertising relevant you have to

111
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,019
know who your users are who are they are

112
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,609

of real<font color="#CCCCCC"> estate investors and the others</font>

123
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,450

the opportunities are it<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems as though</font>

129
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,020
you're offering to your users would be a

privately held company and we're

136
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,980
basically keeping all of our options

of consolidation in the real estate

139
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,340
industry you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been a lot of rumors</font>

140
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,200
recently about Google being interested

141
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,890
in buying trulia and getting into local

142
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,450
market search opportunities and real

143
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,520
estate as about as local as it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,810
don't think it's out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the question</font>

145
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,850
that at some point we might entertain an

146
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,470
acquisition or roll up or something but

147
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,700
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's nothing on the docket</font>
