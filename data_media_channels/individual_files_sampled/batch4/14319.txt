here's the male feminist headquarters called Vox riding about this some some congressmen won't be alone with women's staffers they don't know how damaging that is really damaging to whom pence meets with women all the time in the course of his work he's not active women you saw the quote from the Washington Post he just won't go for a private one-on-one meal with a woman who saw his wife and he won't go to a boozy event without his wife here's here's how vice magazine put it he said they said no matter who he eats with Mike Pence is bad for women the vice president who won't have dinner along with a woman who cares he's bad for women a his wife does something so I think she likes us a lot dozens of non groped non raped female staff probably liked it too I'm guessing Mike Pence doesn't have a button to click to lock women in his office with from the inside oh by the way I just quoted from Vice magazine which it was recently revealed they actually required young women who go to work for Vice to sign contracts agreeing to be sexually harassed in the workplace you think I'm making this up they literally had to consent to sexual content and inappropriate communications before they were allowed to work for vice so yeah I'm guessing it's nicer to work as a woman for Mike Pence then for the company that actually had lawyers draft up a contract allowing sexual harassment just a guess here the male feminist said Vox once again let me quote them former Trump advisors says the pence rule would have protected women from Weinstein he's wrong Mike Pence has a rule about being alone with women that doesn't make women safer really if Harvey Weinstein was never alone with a female staffer a female actress that wouldn't have made them safer are you seriously look at those pictures of Emma Watson again literally being handled by Weinstein take into his private car and then who knows what you're telling me that if there had been someone else there either Weinstein's wife or perhaps Watson's mother you're saying it wouldn't have been safer how how could you possibly say that how could it not have been safer you know tradition custom manners rules culture these are habits but they're much more than habits aren't they they're they're age-old solutions to age-old problems that perhaps we've even forgotten about that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
