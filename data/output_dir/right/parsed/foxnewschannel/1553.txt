>> WELL, I THINK I MAKE A BETTER
SENATOR THAN THE OTHER TWO
CANDIDATES AND I THINK I CAN
WIN.
>> Neil: SO WHEN YOU HEAD
PATRICK
PATRIC
PATRICK MORRISEY SAY THAT YOU
COULD CONTINUE THE REPUBLICANS
THIS SENATE SEEK PICK UP, YOU
SAY WHAT?
>> I SAY NUMBER 1, THAT WHEN I
WAS RUNNING IN THE PRIMARY, THEY
SAID I WAS RUNNING SOLELY TO BE
VENGEFUL AGAINST SENATOR
MANCHIN.
NOW THEY'RE SAYING I'M RUNNING
TO CAUSE SENATOR MANCHIN TO WIN.
I'M RUNNING TO WIN.
>> Neil: YOU MUST KNOW YOU HAVE
BETTER ODDS OF TAKING VOTES AWAY
FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
THAN THE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT,
RIGHT?
>> NOT 100% SURE OF THAT.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE VERY FED UP
WITH SENATOR MANCHIN AND THERE'S
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS THAT ARE IN
SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA IN THE
MINING FIELDS WHERE I'M KNOWN
AND RESPECTED.
>> Neil: SO HAVING PLACED THIRD,
DO YOU THINK IN THAT RIGHT THAT
YOU COULD HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT
IN THIS ONE?
EVEN IF YOU WERE ALLOWED TO RUN
AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE.
>> I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE I'M BE
ALLOWED TO RUN.
THE LAW IS CLEAR ON THAT.
100% CHANCE IF IT'S DECIDED
BASED ON THE LAW.
>> Neil: THERE'S A SORE LOSER
FEATURE AND YOU WOULD BE DEEMED
A SORE LOSER, YOU'D SAY THAT IS
WRONG?
>> MY ATTORNEYS TELL ME THAT IS
WRONG.
WE'LL FIND OUT.
BASED ON THE LAW, I'M CONFIDENT
WE'LL BE ON THE BALLOT AND IF WE
ARE WE HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING
BECAUSE OF THEIR FLAWED PAST.
>> Neil: HAS THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL REACHED OUT TO YOU OR
YOU TO HE AFTER THE PRIMARY?
>> NO, I'VE NOT TALKED TO HIM.
I TALKED TO HIM AFTER THE DEBATE
ON FOX BUT I'M NOT SURE.
I MAY HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM ONE
MORE TIME AFTER THAT.
>> Neil: HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO
SENATOR MANCHIN?
>> NO, I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO
SENATOR MANCHIN IN SEVEN OR
EIGHT YEARS.
SENATOR MANCHIN, IF YOU RECALL,
SAID I HAD BLOOD ON MY HANDS
AFTER THE EXPLOSION.
OF COURSE, IT'S OF GREAT
INTEREST TO HEAR THIS TALK ABOUT
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND
BEING SO CORRUPT AND ALL OF
THESE ISSUES THAT THEY HAD.
IT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
THAT INDICTED ME ON THREE
FELONIES BUT COULDN'T CONVICT ME
ON ANY.
IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT THE NEWS
MEDIA AND THIS NETWORK AS WELL
CONTINUES TO TELL PEOPLE I'M A
FELON WHICH'S NEVER BEEN
CONVICTED OF A FELONY.
I'M LESS LIKELY TO BE A FELON
THAN ANYONE GIVEN THAT I WAS
INVESTIGATED FOR 4 1/2 YEARS AND
THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
>> Neil: SO WHAT ARE YOU IF YOU
SERVED TIME IN JAIL?
>> A MISS
>> A MISDE
>> A MISDEME
>> A MISDEMEAN
>> A MISDEMEANOR
>> A MISDEMEANOR.
THE ONLY ONE TO SERVE TIME IN
CALIFORNIA.
THAT SHOULD TELL US SOMETHING AS
WHEN WHEN THEY'RE SENDING
MISDEMEANORS TO PRISON WHEN THEY
CAN'T COMMUNICATE.
IT'S PRETTY TELLING.
>> Neil: THERE ARE THOSE THAT
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT.
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S BIGGER THAN
A MISDEMEANOR WHEN 29 PEOPLE ARE
2010 FOR WHICH YOU OR YOUR
COMPANY WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR
VIOLATING SAFETY STANDARDS AND
THE REST.
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AND
OBVIOUSLY YOU FELT THAT WAY
AFTERWARDS.
THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN A
MISDEMEANOR, RIGHT?
>> IF YOU STRETCH IT THAT FAR.
THE GOVERNMENT BLEW UP THE COAL
MINES.
THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO COVER
WHAT HAPPENED --
>> Neil: DID YOU VIOLATE SAFETY
STANDARDS?
THAT YOU VIOLATED SAFETY
STANDARDS AND THAT'S WHAT
PROMPTED ALL OF THIS AND YOU TO
GO TO JAIL?
>> NO, I'VE NEVER VIOLATED A
SAFETY STANDARD MYSELF.
COAL COMPANIES HAVE LOTS OF
VIOLATIONS.
THIS MINE WAS AVERAGE.
IT HAD LESS THAN ONE VIOLATION
PER INSPECTOR A DAY OVER 2 1/2
YEARS.
BOTH THE MEDIA AND THE
GOVERNMENT MADE IT OUT IT WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER.
IT WAS 20% LESS THAN THE MINE
NEXT DOOR AND 20% MORE AFTER I
LEFT THE COMPANY.
IS SO IT'S AN EASY STORY FOR THE
MEDIA AND THE GOVERNMENT TO
TELL, BUT IT'S UNTRUE.
>> MR. BLANKENSHIP, I'M
WONDERING NOW, IF YOU PURSUE
THIS, OBVIOUSLY YOU'D RAISE CAN
UNDERSTAND AMONG SENATE
REPUBLICANS THAT THIS IS A
POTENTIAL PICKUP FOR THEM
INCLUDING MITCH McCONNELL THAT
HOPED THAT YOU WOULD LOSE AND HE
HAD HIS WITCH
HAD HIS WISH
HAD HIS WISH,
HAD HIS WISH, I
HAD HIS WISH, I T
HAD HIS WISH, I TH
HAD HIS WISH, I THIN
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK H
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK HE
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK HE S
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK HE SEN
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK HE SENT
YOU A SNARKY REMINDER AFTER
THAT.
IS THIS ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL?
>> NO.
IT'S ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT --
>> Neil: WHO IS THE
ESTABLISHMENT?
>> IT'S BOTH THE REPUBLICANS AND
THE DEMOCRATS.
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A SITUATION
WHERE THEY ARE MORE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE PARTIES.
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STAND UP
AGAINST THEM.
I'VE BEEN SO ABUSED BY THE
GOVERNMENT AND SENT TO PRISON AS
A MISDEMEANOR, I'M VERY
MOTIVATED TO STAND UP AGAINST
THIS NONSENSE.
>> Neil: A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU
WERE THE ESTABLISHMENT.
YOU WERE RUNNING FOR THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
>> I'M SORRY?
>> Neil: A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU
WERE THE ESTABLISHMENT.
YOU WERE RUNNING FOR THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
NOW IT SEEMS AFTER FAILING TO
GET IT, PLACING THIRD, YOU'RE
BITTER AND ANGRY AND NOW YOU'RE
NOT ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU'RE
RUNNING APART FROM THOSE
PARTIES, RIGHT?
>> Neil: AGAIN, YOU CAN SAY
THAT.
IT'S NOT TRUE.
I RAN ON THE PLATFORM OF NOT
VOTING FOR MITCH McCONNELL AND
ON THE PLATFORM OF BALANCING THE
BUDGET AND ON THE PLATFORM OF
STOPPING THE EFFORTS TO POLICE
THE WORLD, WHICH WEST VIRGINIANS
TO BELIEVE IN.
>> Neil: DIDN'T THEY VOTE
ACCORDINGLY AND SAY WHATEVER THE
MERITS.
>> THEY DIDN'T RUN ON THE FACTS.
THEY RAN ON WHAT FOX NEWS AND
OTHERS WERE SAYING THAT I WAS A
FELON, INCLUDING PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S SON --
>> Neil: I'M JUST SAYING THAT --
TO BE CLEAR, ARE YOU SAYING THAT
RESIDENTS AND VOTERS THAT OPTED
FOR TWO OTHER CANDIDATES OVER
YOU WERE DOOPED?
>> YES, I'M SAYING THEY WERE
MISLED BY THE PRESIDENT'S SON TO
SIX OR SEVEN SEPARATORS TO THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A
WHOLE HOST OF OTHER PEOPLE.
BECAUSE EVERYONE JOINED IN TO
THIS LIE ABOUT MY HAVING
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE
EXPLOSION.
I WAS NEVER EVEN TRIED FOR
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE
EXPLOSION.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA CLAIMS THAT
HE KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE
COAL MAN BEFORE ANYBODY WENT
UNDERGROUND.
>> Neil: I'M SORRY, SIR.
BUT WOULD YOU DO -- IF THE STATE
SAID YOU CAN'T DO THIS, WE HAVE
THIS LAW IN EFFECT, YOUR LAWYER
SEEMED TO BE TELLING YOU NO, YOU
CAN GET ON THE BALLOT ANYWAY AS
A WRITE IN.
IS THAT THE LAST -- THE LAST
STRATEGY, YOU CAN USE AS A WRITE
IN CANDIDATE?
>> I COULD.
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO.
THE LAW -- THEY WROTE ANOTHER
LAW JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO
THAT TAKES EFFECT IN JUNE TRYING
TO CLARIFY THEIR SORE LOSER LAW.
THEY OBVIOUSLY WEREN'T
COMFORTABLE WITH THE SORE LOSER
LAW --
>> Neil: SO YOU'RE NOT A SORE,
BITTER LOSER?
>> NO.
I'M A LITTLE BIT BITTER AT THE
FACT THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO
REPORT THAT I'M A FELON AND
CONTINUE TO CLAIM SOMETHING THAT
IS OBVIOUSLY FALSE.
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I-75
FROM LAURA INGLE AND JUDGE
NAPOLITANO HAVE TO STOP THAT.
>> Neil: WE CAN GO AROUND AND
AROUND ON THIS, SIR.
I UNDERSTAND.
WE CAN GO AROUND ON THIS.
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU ARE HELL
BENT ON GETTING ON THAT BALLOT
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH
THE STATE SAYS YOU CAN'T?
>> THE STATE HASN'T SAID WE
CAN'T.
THE STATE HASN'T DECIDED THAT
YET.
WHEN WE FINALLY FILED THE PAPERS
TO BE ON THE BALLOT --
