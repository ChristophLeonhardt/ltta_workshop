I strongly strongly recommend that people do not bring their phones into the bedroom that also includes iPads and other tablets even TV and certainly laptops anything related to work or even socializing really doesn't belong in the bedroom it mixes the message your bedroom should be a place where sleep happens and if you're in bed and you're activating yourself with all of this other information it's it's going to weaken the association that you have that makes you sleepy when you get into bed these devices emit blue light even if you have special apps I still don't recommend it because that blue light is going to suppress your natural release of melatonin and make it harder to go to sleep being tied into the business of the day whether it's personal or work is something that keeps your mind active it keeps the stress of the day going until the moment when you close your eyes and that is really not good for sleep quality
