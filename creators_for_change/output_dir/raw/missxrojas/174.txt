politics government organizing all

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,990
fascinate me and we all know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,940
thoroughly addicted to political TV

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,529
shows but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came a point last year and I</font>

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">was so disillusioned with British</font>

6
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,679
politics that I couldn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> face the</font>

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,719
thick of it so i was on a strict diet of

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,269
us political shows only and I roles

9
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,330
after I<font color="#CCCCCC"> roles at every PMQs and every</font>

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,939
really sighting of an MP but then

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,949
towards the end of 2014 I was given the

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity by the organization bite the</font>

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,760
ballot to speak and take your questions

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,619
to Nick Clegg and EDD Miliband<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,330
is part of why their ballots fantastic

16
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,279
60 minutes leaders live<font color="#E5E5E5"> programmes</font>

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,260
conversations between a party leader and

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,120
an audience streamed live on the

19
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,739
internet and more often<font color="#CCCCCC"> than not picked</font>

20
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,510
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the news that same day these are</font>

21
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,920
events when I could quiz the prime

22
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,300
ministerial candidates on their

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,010
positions and try to push them towards

24
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,120
those conversations that we've been

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
having online conversations about things

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,660
like women in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the workplace and racial</font>

27
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,340
biases when we talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> immigration</font>

28
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,199
but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than that I kind of served</font>

29
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,210
as a vessel or a channel through which

30
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,190
your questions could be answered so

31
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,750
people would tweet me that questions and

32
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,280
I would try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and raise them with the</font>

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,199
prime ministerial candidate of that day

34
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,760
it's worth noting at this point the

35
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,110
prior to the events<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been able to</font>

36
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">attend but the ballot had also hosted</font>

37
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Farage and Bennett</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you Kip and the</font>

38
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,110
Green Party respectively so after

39
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,670
speaking to clegg adminip and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

40
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excited and waiting asking</font>

41
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,240
constantly the by the ballot team when

42
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,100
is David Cameron coming on leaders live

43
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,720
and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I understood there was a</font>

44
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,250
lot of behind-the-scenes tour going on

45
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,960
they were in talks to 10 Downing Street

46
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,970
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh so conveniently on the very</font>

47
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,770
week that david cameron announced that

48
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,780
he would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not take part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in any televised</font>

49
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,390
debates that excluded the Green Party he

50
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,610
also pulled out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talks with leaders</font>

51
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,250
live but what was lost here was the

52
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,049
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a conversation with</font>

53
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,040
the Prime Minister<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the country</font>

54
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,560
someone who had for better or for worse

55
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,390
shape this country of the past five

56
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,399
years shaped it ideologically as well

57
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,110
with his party values I mean regardless

58
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,430
of what you like him it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

59
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,990
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> tonight that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is someone</font>

60
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,939
who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge impact and then and I</font>

61
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's dad insult</font>

62
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,899
injury on Monday he spoke out<font color="#CCCCCC"> or kids</font>

63
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,700
apps like whatsapp and snapchat

64
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,950
situation with that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he said if</font>

65
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,460
they don't hand over

66
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,110
they're encrypted messages or encrypted

67
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,670
message software to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the intelligence</font>

68
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">services and he would pursue banning</font>

69
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,659
them he personally would pursue banning

70
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,979
them say I mean this whole thing seemed

71
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,240
really results me on the one hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

72
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,560
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> David Cameron and his team saying</font>

73
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't have time over next hundred</font>

74
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,270
and ten or so days before the election

75
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,100
60 minutes basically to speak to young

76
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,959
people on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand or really on</font>

77
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,520
the same hand you've got him saying that

78
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's going to piss you banning things</font>

79
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,430
that are mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> used by young people</font>

80
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,380
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your 87 year old voter that's</font>

81
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,510
using snapchat at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on mass so</font>

82
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,380
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure at this point the only</font>

83
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,880
thing don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever really can do is</font>

84
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,130
backtrack come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaders live talk to</font>

85
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,690
young people rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them and</font>

86
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,070
making decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them so we don't</font>

87
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,540
have to continue feeling like

88
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,220
politicians are just shouting at us and

89
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,810
telling us what to do like with five

90
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,790
years old we're eligible to vote we are

91
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,380
eligible to take power and we will take

92
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,910
power whether that means voting for a

93
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,739
party<font color="#E5E5E5"> or knowing exactly how to spoil</font>

94

our ballot so if you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> me are a</font>
