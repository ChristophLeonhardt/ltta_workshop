ELECTION.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,179
MIKE EMANUEL HAS THE STORY.

4
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:09,715
>> WITH CONFLICTING POLLS OUT

5
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:10,682
THERE, HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERS

6
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:11,784
AND THEIR MAJOR SUPPORTERS ARE

7
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:14,953
NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES AHEAD OF

8
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:16,088
NOVEMBER'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

9
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:17,423
SHELDON ABELSON HAS GIVEN

10
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:19,191
$30 MILLION TO HELP THE HOUSE

11
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:21,326
G.O.P. KEEP ITS MAJORITY.

12
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:22,494
IN HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER

13
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:24,329
NANCY PELOSI MAY HAVE GIVEN

14
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,331
REPUBLICANS ANOTHER GIFT BY

15
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:27,733
SUGGESTING THAT SHE'D INCREASED

16
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,033
TAXES.

17
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:30,069
>> THE SECOND PART IS ACCURATE.

18
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,036
[LAUGHS]

19
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:34,406
I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD

20
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:35,474
REVISIT THE TAX LEGISLATION AND

21
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:38,177
THE WAY THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE.

22
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:40,112
IN A BIPARTISAN, TRANSPARENT

23
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:41,113
WAY.

24
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:42,014
THAT THE RESULT IS UNIFYING FOR

25
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:44,883
THE COUNTRY.

26
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:46,018
>> CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES PLAN TO

27
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:47,553
PLAY THAT CLIP UNTIL ELECTION

28
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:49,955
DAY NOVEMBER AND SUGGEST THAT IT

29
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,091
MIGHT BE THE SHOT IN THE ARM

30
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,358
NEEDED TO ENERGIZE THE G.O.P.

31
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:53,759
BASE.

32
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,694
>> IS THAT ENOUGH TO ALARM

33
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:56,495
REPUBLICAN VOTERS ACROSS THE

34
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:57,329
COUNTRY?

35
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,431
THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES ON

36
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:00,899
HARDWORKING AMERICANS AND

37
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,569
BUSINESSES, THEY WANT TO MAKE IT

38
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,904
TO STAY IN AMERICA, I CANNOT

39
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:07,773
IMAGINE THAT AMERICA WILL WANT

40
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:09,141
THAT TO HAPPEN.

41
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,109
>> HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHIP STEVE

SCHOOLEY SAYS THAT THEY CAN RUN

43
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:12,311
ON THE RECORD.

44
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:13,112
>> THE LAST THING PEOPLE WANT TO

45
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:16,782
DO IS TURN THE CLOCK BACK AND GO

46
00:01:16,782 --> 00:01:18,150
BACK-TO-BACK WHEN NANCY PELOSI

47
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,351
WAS SPEAKER AND RUNNING THROUGH

48
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,919
LEGISLATION THAT WRECKED THE

49
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:21,320
ECONOMY.

50

BATTLE.

53
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,958

55
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:28,227
NEVER SAID THAT THIS WILL BE

56
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:28,760
EASY.

57
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,895
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT

FOR EVERY ENTRY KNOW THAT WE ARE

59
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:33,699
GOING TO BE IN A POSITION TO DO

60
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:33,966
