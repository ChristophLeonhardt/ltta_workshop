>>> NO MORE THAN TEN YEARS 
BEHIND BARS.
THIS WAS A VIDEO EARLIER OF HIM 
ARRIVING TO COURT TODAY.
HE HAD A SMILE ON HIS FACE UNTIL
HE LEARNED THE NEWS THAT WE 
LEARNED MOEMENTS AGO.
COSBY WAS CONVICTED IN APRIL OF 
DRUGGING AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING
ANDREA CONSTAND.
THE JURY FOUND COSBY GUILTY ON 
THREE COUNTS.
LINDSEY DAVIS HAS BEEN STANDING 
BY COVERING THIS CASE FROM THE 
GET-GO.
L
LINDSEY, WALK US THROUGH THIS.
>> Reporter: BILL COSBY REMAINED
MOTIONLESS, HE HAD HIS HEAD FOR 
FORWARD AND SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT
AHEAD.
IN THE BACK ROW, IT WAS FILLED 
WITH MAYBE ABOUT EIGHT OTHER 
COSBY ACCUSERS AND THEY HAD 
ALREADY HANDED OUT TISSUES AND 
TEARS BEGAN TO FLOW.
THEY WERE CRYING QUIETLY SO THEY
WOULD NOT GET KICKED OUT IN 
COURT.
THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS AND 
NODDING THEIR HEADS AGAIN AND 
AGAIN.
IT WAS QUIET.
YOU CAN HEAR PIN DROPPED IN THE 
COURTROOM.
THE JUDGE SAYS HE'LL HAVE TO PAY
FOR THE PROSECUTION COST AND 
$25,000 FINE.
LEADING UP TO HIS SENTENCE, HE 
GAVE SOME REALLY STRONG QUOTES 
DIRECTLY AIMED AT BILL COSBY AND
HE SAID, THE JURY'S VERDICT MUST
BE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR.
YOU ARE CONVICTED OF A SERIOUS 
CRIME AGAIN AND AGAIN.
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.
HE TALKED ABOUT DESPITE HOW MUCH
MONEY AND FAME AND CELEBRITY YOU
HAVE, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.
>> LINDSEY, WHEN THE JUDGE 
CLASSIFIED HIM AS A SEXUAL LEVI 
LENT PREDATOR, HE SENT A SIGNAL 
THERE, HIS PENNSYLVANIA STATE 
LAW DEFINED THE SEXUAL VIOLENT 
PREDATOR AS A PERSON WHO HAS A 
MENTAL DISORDER THAT MAKES THE 
PERSON TO ENGAGE IN PREDATORY 
SEXUALLY BODILY DEFENSES.
THAT DID NOT WORK IN THE JUDGE'S
DECISION OF HIS ILLNESS AND 
DISABILITIES.
>> Reporter: YOU'RE RIGHT, IT 
DID NOT WORK.
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID 
SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, YOU DON'T 
GET OUT OF JAIL A FREE CARD 
BECAUSE YOU ARE OLD OR BECAUSE 
IT IS TAKEN THIS LONG FOR 
JUSTICE TO CATCH UP TO YOU.
THE STATE'S PRISON ARE EQUIPPED 
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OLD OR BLIND.
IT SEEMS CLEAR EARLY ON THAT THE
JUDGE WHO GAVE A LENGTHY 
STATEMENT BEFORE HE GAVE THE 
SENTENCE THAT HE WAS NOT GOING 
TO BUY THAT.
HE BASICALLY SAID LOOK, WHAT YOU
ARE CHARGED OF REQUIRES THAT I 
GIVE YOU THIS TOTAL CONFINEMENT 
AND KEPT MENTIONING THAT HE 
WOULD NEEDED TO PROTECT THE 
PUBLIC AND ALSO THAT HE WOULD 
NEED THIS PRISON TIME BASICALLY 
IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE GRAVITY 
OF THIS CHARGE.
>> LINDSEY, YOU INTERVIEWED BILL
COSBY DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS, 
DO YOU THINK ONCE THE JUDGE 
HANDED DOWN THAT SENTENCE THAT 
IT HIT HIM THAT HE REALIZED THAT
HE WAS GOING TO PRISON.
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL 
PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD AND LABELED 
AMERICA'S DAD AND NOW HE'S 
BEHIND BARS.
>> YO
. 
>> Reporter: IT SEEMS HE HAD 
BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS OUTCOME.
TO YOUR POINT AND TO TALK TO THE
GRAVITY OF THIS SITUATION, THERE
WAS A QUOTE IN 1981 FROM A 
FORMER P.R. EXEC, COCA-COLA, HE 
SAYS THE MOST BELIEVABLE 
PERSONALITIES OF OUR DAY ARE 
GOD, AND BILL COSBY, NOW YOU 
HAVE BILL COSBY, ONE OF THE MOST
CREDIBLE VOICES OF OUR SOCIETY 
NOW IS BEING SENTENCED TO NO 
LESS THAN THREE YEARS BUT AS 
MANY AS TEN YEARS BEHIND BARS.
>> AN INCREDIBLE FALL FROM 
GRACE, 60 WOMEN HAVE COME 
FORWARD AND ACCUSED HIM OF 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING THEM.
I WANT TO PUT THE STATEMENT 
ANDREA CONSTAND SAID.
>> BILL COSBY TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL,
HEALTHY YOUNG SPIRIT AND CRUSHED
IT.
HE ROBBED ME OF MY VITALITY WILL
WILL -- THE FIRST CONVICTED MAN.
I WANT TO BRING IN YOUR SENIOR 
CORRES
CORRESPONDENT, YOUR THOUGHTS ON 
THE SENTENCING.
>> IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS 
JUDGE LOOKED AT BILL COSBY AS HE
WOULD LOOK AT OTHER DEFENDANT.
HE'S NOT ABOVE THE LAW.
THIS SENTENCE IS WITHIN THE 
RANGE OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT 
SOMEONE WOULD GET AND SOMEONE 
HAS BEEN CONVICTED AND 
CLASSIFIED AS A SEXUAL LELY VIOT
PREDATOR.
A RANGE OF NO LESS THAN THREE TO
TEN WAS COMPLETELY IN THE 
GUIDELINES.
ONCE HE WAS CLASSIFIED AS A 
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR, THAT 
MEANS SOMEONE THAT PLANNED THIS.
HOW DO YOU PROTECT THE COMMUNITY
FROM SOMEONE WHO CAN'T CONTROL 
HIMSELF.
>> THAT WAS THE DETERMINING 
POINT TODAY.
HE MAY BE 81 YEARS OLD AND BLIND
AND FRAIL BUT IF HE'S STILL 
UNDER HOUSE ARREST, HE CAN STILL
ATTACK THEM.
>> SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
IN DETERMINING THIS SORT OF 
SENTENCE, YOU LOOK AT HIS 
PREVIOUS RECORD, COSBY DID NOT 
HAVE ONE.
THIS IS CLEARLY SERIOUS AND THE 
AGGRAVATING FACTORS AND 
MITIGATING FACTORS, HE FALLS 
SQUARELY INTO THIS SENTENCE.
>> THANK YOU, I WANT TO GO BACK 
TO LINDSEY.
>> HE DOES PLAN TO APPEAL AND 
THE APPEAL PROCESS STARTS NOW.
>> Reporter: YES, EXACTLY, 
ACCORDING TO PENNSYLVANIA'S LAW,
YOU CAN'T START WITHOUT AN 
APPEAL PROCESS UNTIL AFTER A 
SENTENCING.
THERE IS A LAWYER IN COURT FOR 
HIM TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS 
IMMEDIATELY.
BILL COSBY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY 
AND THE JUDGE REMINDED HIM, ARE 
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY 
ANYTHING.
HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 
THE PRIOR WORDS PRIOR TO THE 
JUDGE SENTENCING, HE CHOSE TO 
STAY QUIET.
THIS IS A CLEAR VICTORY FOR THE 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY, THEY ASKED 
FOR FIVE TO TEN YEARS, THEY'RE 
GETTING AT LEAST THREE TO TEN.
LINDSEY DAVIS FOR US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
REPORTING.
BILL COSBY ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL ENTERTAINERS HAVE JUST 
BEEN TENSED TO THREE TO TEN 
YEARS BEHIND BARS.
