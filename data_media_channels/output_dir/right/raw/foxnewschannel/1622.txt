MIGRATION.

67
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,076
THAT'S A MASS MULTIPLIER OF

IMMIGRATION INTO THE UNITED

00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:31,114

00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:35,752
MERIT.

73
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,624

74
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:41,958
PROCESS.

75
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,393
THAT'S ALL IN THE BILL.

76
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:46,529
YOU DON'T NEED FOUR BILLS.

77
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:50,600
>> WE DON'T HAVE THE BALLS FOR

78
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,701
THAT BILL.

79
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,136
DONALD TRUMP SAID I WANT TO

80
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:56,072
BUILD A WALL.

81
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:57,073
LET'S COME TOGETHER FOR 25

82
00:02:57,073 --> 00:03:01,577
BILLION DOLLARS AND BUILD THE

83
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:03,913
WALL AND MAKE OTHER TWEAKS.

84
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,481
WE WILL DEAL WITH DACA.

85
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:06,716
THAT'S A PACKAGE THAT THE

86
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:07,750
PRESIDENT WANTS.

87
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,920
IT'S GENEROUS FOR THE DACA KIDS

88
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,088
BUT GIVES US BORDER SECURITY.

89
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,590
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN

90
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,558
THE SENATE.

91
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:25,268
>> I CAN'T SUPPORT THE GOOD LAT

92
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:25,568
BILL.

93
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,035
>> Laura: WHY?

94
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:28,438
>> I DIDN'T SUPPORT PRESIDENT

95
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,940
TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER.

96
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,176
I THOUGHT IT WAS

97
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:34,077
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

98
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:36,512

99
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:37,513
OBAMA'S POLICY 3 YEARS DOESN'T

100
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:38,281
MAKE SENSE.

101
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:41,150
WE NEED TO FIX THE WALL AND FIX

102
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,052
SOME PROBLEMS AND HAVE A

103
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:43,920
PERMANENT FIX.

108
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,928
>> YES, OF COURSE.

109
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:54,597
>> Laura: THE ONLY PROBLEM YOU

110
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:58,668
HAVE IS WITH THE AMNESTY OF

111
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:01,003
800,000?

112
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:04,807
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE

113
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:05,108
ORDER.

00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:09,779
CHAIN MIGRATION.

116
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:12,048
CHAIN MIGRATION YOU CHANGE THE

117
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:13,950
GAME WITH IMMIGRATION.

118
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,218
>> BUT HE CHANGED THE DYNAMIC

119
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,120
FOR KIDS THAT GO TO OUR HIGH

120
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,757
SCHOOL UNCONSTITUTIONAL HE.

121
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:23,726
IF WE ARE GOING TO FIX THIS.

122
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:24,961
IT'S AN AMERICAN PEOPLE.

123
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,496

WALL BUILD AND TO END THE VISA

131
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:37,840
LOTTERY.

132

>> HE SAID IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS

133
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:44,480
DONE, HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THE

134
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,747
CR.

KIDS, IF YOU DON'T END CHAIN

137
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,353
MIGRATION, THE KIDS AND THE

138
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:53,489
PARENTS WHO BROUGHT THEM IN GET

139
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:55,158
LEGAL STATUS.

00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,094
LET'S BE HONEST.

143
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:02,532
>> WE HAVE TO FIX THAT PART WITH

144
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,367
DACA.

145
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,301

00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:07,236
WIN ON GIVING AMNESTY TO THE

147
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,237
DACA KIDS.

148
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:10,640
HE WON ON BORDER SECURITY.

149
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,241
BUILDING A WALL AND EVEN

150
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,177
CALIFORNIA THE MAJORITY WANT

151
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,112
DEPORTATION TO GO ON.

152
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:19,582
THE BERKELEY POLL IS

153
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:19,982
DEVASTATING.

154
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:22,218
59% SAID IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

155
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:24,153
START DEPORTING THESE PEOPLE.

156
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:26,556
>> THE PRESIDENT PUT THE

157
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:28,691
DEMOCRATS ON NOTICE.

158
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,027
THE DEMOCRATS HAD 42 BILLION OUT

159
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:32,128
OF EVERY DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE.

160
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,564
PUT THEM TO THE TEST ON THIS

161
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:34,864
ISSUE.

162
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:36,566

NANCY PELOSI.

165
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,236
I DON'T THINK WE WILL LOSE IN

166
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,270
THE HOUSE.

167
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,773
LET'S GET A FAMILY SOLUTION.

168
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:46,776
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT

169
00:05:46,776 --> 00:00:00,000
