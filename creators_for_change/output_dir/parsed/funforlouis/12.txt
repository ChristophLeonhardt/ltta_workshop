get a view item on okay oh this is
amazing what is this little window in

the original maverick breath nice quiet
that's way quieter than me so that's our
hotel down there pretty cool spot okay
we've got some cool photos we're gonna
head down is that the pallet there yeah
I think we're gonna head down maybe to
the palace which might be there I love
this tunnel as a circle
Helly do you think you just push one of
these bricks and they're like opens all
right off to the palace this little
courtyard is so stunning
check out the palace that almost doesn't
really look real like I feel like that's
a movie set and made of like styrofoam
or something but it's amazing and then
these beautiful colorful buildings
I hadn't really liked research Monaco at
all but I don't think I was expecting
this I think I guess I was expecting a
lot more like modern buildings but
beautiful check these piles of cannon
boats out all right this is a golden
bastard prince albert ii
and took a thousand hours to make and
it's 18 karat gold weighs 30 kilograms

Room I think we've just nipped down the
road to get a good sunset spot so we can
hang out with instagramers Jacob's got
the I where to be for sunset so yeah

this guy our burgers he's actually been
doing a tea I mean the fact that he went
four years from daily blowing like that

billion euros cash right here to do
another year a daily

be very

honest and nominated and yeah it was
really cool getting to know a few people
that I haven't met before but I've been
meeting - meaning - like Murad and Young
Olsen and like it's just exciting to
cross paths with people in the same
industry that I haven't had a chance to
meet yeah
