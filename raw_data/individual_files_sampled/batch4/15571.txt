you knew that Linda Sarsour was coming and you had a petition and we bought the website Linda Sarsour dot CA which sign of thousands of petition signers you also rented a Jumbotron truck to go down to the convention we got a couple of clips of that I want to show our people but tell me first I mean what though there it is on the screen right now what a gorgeous gorgeous mess so big and bright share the facts and sign the petition Linda Sarsour dot CA so that way that's her she has a very distinctive look she's always shouting and wearing the hijab so you went out there to the convention with the truck there's a couple of clips I want to show but tell me first how were you received well it's funny as for the name of this convention was carry the light however it seemed that the people running carry the light didn't want any light being shed on carry the light so we were doing Streeters and it was very cordial just interviewing people on the streets absolutely and you know sadly I have to admit like one of my first questions was you know after what brings you out here what are your thoughts on Sharia law which is what Linda Sarsour stands for is it compatible with Canadian law I'm sad to report that not a single person said oh no no no that's not for us here in Canada we subscribe to one law one constitution that is the Canadian one everyone had this like wiggle room or well you know I have to read into it or or maybe there's a way to put some Cherie and I found that personally disturbing I would have liked to have seen someone patriotically denounce that kind of law and then the organizers came out and they started interfering with our interviews claiming we were harassing people that was absolutely not the case as right you can go through all the footage anyone that didn't want to speak I said okay thanks for your time and we were basically booted out to the parking lot instead of the conference center entrance and someone from the international center she said you can't come near the conference entrance but you can stay in the parking lot well I can tell you as soon as started interfering people in the parking lot that role changed we were booted right off the parking lot as well which is the right of the International Center I mean private property it is private property and it is the client and and we complied but I just thought as really the profound perverse irony here of a conference called carry the light but they don't want any light shed on what so I have to ask myself what was going on in there that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
