well Brian we have plenty to discuss talk through this ad campaign and your response to those who say this is as Kerry Severino from the Judicial Crisis Network told me earlier on the show alluded to this an eleventh-hour smear campaign by the left well that's an absurd allegation considering that their full reason that dianne feinstein kept this letter private was because that was at the wish of the of the survivor here and as soon as the survivor changed her mind on that point and came forward in The Washington Post this is now something that Brett Kavanagh has to answer for and that Senators have to investigate and I have to say we're troubled I think we're seeing increasing signs that Republicans are not approaching this in a good-faith way 24 hours ago you were hearing a background report suggesting that Republicans strategy was going to be to try to put this woman on the spot try to force her to come testify before she had indicated that she was willing to do so then it turned out that she called their bluff her lawyer went on TV yesterday and said she's perfectly willing to come testify and so now I think they're going through the motions of setting up a hearing that is not intended to be a serious fact-finding mission it is intended to be a show trial where they intend to try to smear this woman is it is it sufficient for you for this hearing to see the two witnesses that we believe will be called Abby Cavanaugh Cavanaugh and and and dr. Blasi fourth what would you want to see other people the friend for example mr. judge she was in the room when this happened experts on sexual assault crimes it says well Anita Hill who knows this situation better than anyone because she went through it in the early 1990s has an op-ed out today where she said learned a lesson from the hearings where I testified and don't conduct the same misbegotten hearings that you did in the early 1990s what does that mean invite corroborating witnesses in if this is gonna be a serious fact-finding mission why would you not call mark judge it is so rare that in these instances you have an actual third-party witness mark judge was in the room force him to answer questions under oath why wouldn't you have the therapist in that can corroborate that this victim has been talking about this for a year isn't because of the trauma has been so severe and why wouldn't you allow the FBI to reopen the background check the White House has the ability to allow the FBI to reopen the background check in to Brett Kavanaugh to at least take sworn statements from dr. Blasi they're not doing that if you if my right has there been six FBI background checks at these various points throughout Kavanaugh life and they had it hasn't come forward until now thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
