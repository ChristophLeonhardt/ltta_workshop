an uncommon yet welcome sight for this time of year nan nan Mountain reveals itself during the rainy season the top peaks of the rains containing the thumb long cave Network is usually completely hidden by clouds underground rescuers work quickly during the break in rain installing more pipes and pumps as they try to lower the water level in the flooded caves divers also continue to supply the twelve boys in their football coach with food and water ferrying supplies nearly five kilometres into the cave ledge where they have sought refuge for 12 days it takes the divers six hours to reach them the group is being trained by expert divers from the Thai Navy SEALs on the basics of diving with scuba equipment they'll stay with the boys until they are out what they will seek now not brain and we stop that water coat inside and drain it at the low level from the bottom big bottom under growl we bring the water all day on our top but there's a weather deadline the monsoon rains are expected to return on Sunday which is the biggest issue right now is it getting that water level down or training the boys to get it together 130 million litres of water have already been pumped out of the massive cave system though the water level will not be down to a level where the boys can walk all the way out any time soon but getting it as low as possible helps reduce risk when they do finally leave as well as much activity underground rescuers are searching above the cave looking for a possible alternate escape route someone we are calculating the position of the children and the corresponding position on the surface we are also mobilizing our teams to survey the jungle and about 20 to 30 teams will converge in this area to survey for shafts or holes that may be of use to our plan the governor says if the risk assessment of bringing them out is 90% success they will go for it as with the weather forecast it looks like that number will only get smaller
