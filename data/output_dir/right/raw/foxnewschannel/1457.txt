00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:07,760
>> Tucker: WELL, IF YOU LOOK

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,262
CAREFULLY, YOU'LL SEE SUBTLE

3
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:10,964
SIGNS OF DECAY THROUGHOUT OUR

4
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:11,998
SOCIETY.

5
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:14,400
STARBUCKS, ONE EXAMPLE, RECENTLY

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,401
ANNOUNCED GOING FORWARD ITS

7
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,103
SEATS AND BATHROOMS WILL BE

8
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:19,138
OPENED TO NONPAYING CUSTOMERS.

9
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:20,073
THAT'S BAD NEWS IF YOU WANT TO

10
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:21,641
BRING YOUR KIDS THERE.

11
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:23,042
PRETTY GOOD NEWS IF YOU'RE A

12
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:23,376
VAGRANT.

13
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:24,544
MEANWHILE IN NEW YORK A COUPLE

14
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:26,179
HAD TO EVICT THEIR 30-YEAR-OLD

15
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,046
SON FROM THEIR BASEMENT BECAUSE

16
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:29,082
HE REFUSED TO MOVE OUT.

17
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:30,283
MANY DEFENDED HIS DECISION TO

18
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:32,051
LIVE THERE FOREVER.

19
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:34,888
MIKE IS THE HOST OF THE TBN SHOW

20
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:37,323
"SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT."

21
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:38,091
LATEST SEASON OF THAT WILL DEBUT

22
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:38,858
SOON.

23
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:39,726
HE SPOKE TO US ABOUT THESE

24
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:40,560
STORIES AND HOW THEY MAY BE

25
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,094
CONNECTED.

26
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,228
HERE IT IS.

27
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:45,632
>> JOINING US TONIGHT IS MIKE

28
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:45,932
ROWE.

29
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:49,769
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MIKE.

30
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:50,603
>> TUCKER, THANK YOU.

31
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:51,037
HOW ARE YOU?

32
00:00:51,037 --> 00:00:52,839
>> Tucker: CAN'T BE BETTER?

33
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,007
STARBUCKS ANNOUNCING YOU NO

34
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,542
LONGER HAVE TO BUY ANYTHING TO

35
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:56,442
LOUNGE AROUND ITS STORES OR USE

36
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,545
THE BATHROOM.

37
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:00,246
MEANWHILE, 30-YEAR-OLDS ARE

38
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:02,515
SUING TO STAY IN THEIR PARENTS'

39
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:02,916
BASEMENTS.

40
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,816
ARE THESE STORIES CONNECTED?

41
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,886
DO THEY TELL US SOMETHING BIGGER

42
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:09,188
ABOUT WHERE THE COUNTRY IS

43
00:01:09,188 --> 00:01:09,489
GOING?

44
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:12,091
>> DOGS AND CATS LIVING

45
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:12,458
TOGETHER!

46
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:12,892
MASS HYSTERIA.

47
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:14,961
>> Tucker: EXACTLY.

48
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:16,930
>> LOOK, I PERSONALLY, I'M IN

49
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,630
THE MIDST RIGHT NOW OF DOING

50
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,432
WHAT I DO EVERY YEAR WHICH IS

51
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:21,668
TRY AND GIVE AWAY WORK ETHIC

52
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:22,268
SCHOLARSHIPS.

53
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:24,671
IT GETS HARDER EVERY YEAR, SO,

54
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,004
UM --

55
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,373
>> Tucker: WAIT, WAIT IT GETS

56
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:30,443
HARDER TO GIVE AWAY MONEY?

57
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:31,477
>> WE'VE GIVEN AWAY $5 MILLION

58
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:33,713
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, AND,

59
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,916
YES, EVERY YEAR, IT GETS

60
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,986
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO

61
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:41,688
AFFIRMATIVELY REWARD WORK ETHIC.

62
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:44,390
THERE'S SOME THINGS MY

63
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,091
SCHOLARSHIP REQUIRES YOU TO DO

64
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,460
THAT OTHER SCHOLARSHIPS DON'T.

65
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,363
YOU HAVE TO WRITE ESSAYS AND

66
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:52,398
MAKE VIDEOS SIGN A SWEAT PLEDGE.

67
00:01:52,398 --> 00:01:54,500
WHEN PEOPLE ARE OFTEN CONFRONTED

68
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,268
THROUGH THESE HOOPS IN WHICH I

69
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:59,806
ASK THEM TO LEAP, THEY TAKE

70
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:00,607
UMBRIDGE AT THAT.

71
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:02,308
I FIND IT FASCINATING.

72
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,644
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME SO MUCH

73
00:02:04,644 --> 00:02:05,545
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT A

74
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:06,980
VALUABLE THING IS ALMOST ALWAYS

75
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,914
A THING THAT IS IN DEMAND AND

76
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:10,850
WORK ETHIC IS VERY MUCH IN

77
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,285
DEMAND, BUT TO ANSWER YOUR

78
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:14,687
QUESTION, WHY IS IT HARDER TO

79
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:15,321
FIND IT?

80
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,923
I THINK THAT PROBABLY DOES HAVE

81
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:18,925
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE

82
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,860
EXPECTATIONS THAT HAVE EVOLVED

83
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,930
OUT OF THE SAFE SPACE MOVEMENT

84
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,931
WHICH YOU'VE DONE A LOT TO TALK

85
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,432
ABOUT ON YOUR PROGRAM, AND I'M

86
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,334
STARTING TO THINK THAT MAYBE

87
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:30,970
THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE

88
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,605
EXPECTATIONS A PATRON MIGHT HAVE

89
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:35,642
AT A STARBUCKS VIS-A-VIS THE

90
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:36,709
EXPECTATIONS A SQUATTER WHO JUST

91
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,047
HAPPENS TO BE GENETICALLY TIED

92
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:42,115
TO YOU MIGHT HAVE VIS-A-VIS THE

93
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:44,884
BASEMENT IN WHICH HE CURRENTLY

94
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:45,652
DWELLS, ETC., ETC.

95
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,887
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, OF ALL THE

96
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,622
DIVIDES IN THE COUNTRY, I THINK

97
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:51,858
YOU COULD PROBABLY MAKE A PRETTY

98
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:55,361
INTERESTING CASE THAT THERE'S A

99
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:57,730
FISSURE RUNNING THROUGH THE

100
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,032
EXPECTATION OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

101
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:02,301
WE ELEVATE SAFETY AND FEELINGS

102
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:05,738
TO A LEVEL OF PRIMACY.

103
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:06,873
I THINK IT CREATES A REAL

104
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:07,540
DISCONNECT THAT PEOPLE ARE

105
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,676
STRUGGLING TO PARSE.

106
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,077
>> Tucker: WAIT A SECOND!

107
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:12,612
ARE YOU SAYING SAFETY ISN'T THE

108
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:14,414
MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER?

109
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:16,349
>> I'M SAYING THAT EVERYBODY

110
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:17,150
WANTS TO GO HOME SAFE AT THE END

111
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,552
OF THE DAY.

112
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:24,123
SAFETY ALWAYS WOULD BE A

113
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:26,893
DELIGHTFUL BROMIDE A DELIGHTFUL

114
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:27,260
FLATTUDE.

115
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,494
SAFETY FIRST IS THE STUFF OF

116
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:28,995
IDIOCY.

117
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:31,431
IT ALLOWS US TO BEGIN TO BELIEVE

118
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,132
THAT SOMEONE OTHER THAN US MIGHT

119
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,033
CARE MORE ABOUT OUR WELL-BEING

120
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,269
THAN WE DO, AND THE MINUTE WE

121
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,104
BUY INTO THAT NONSENSE, THEN WE

122
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,605
EMBRACE THE WARM GRIP OF

123
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:40,540
COMPLACENCY.

124
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,975
SO, NO, SAFETY IS NOT THE ENEMY,

125
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,211
BUT IF YOU MAKE IT THE PRIORITY,

126
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,946
THEN LET'S JUST WRAP OURSELVES

127
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,448
IN BUBBLE PACK AND DRIVE AT

128
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,148
SPEEDS APPROACHING 5 MILES PER

129
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:51,350
HOUR AND NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING

130
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,619
THAT COULD EVER BE CONFUSED WITH

131
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:53,920
RISK.

132
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,189
>> Tucker: THAT IS REALLY

133
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:56,489
DEEP!

134
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:57,724
WHEN YOU SAY SAFETY FIRST,

135
00:03:57,724 --> 00:04:00,193
YOU'RE ASSUMING -- NO -- I'M

136
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:00,526
SERIOUS.

137
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:04,197
THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY

138
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,699
UNARTICULATED ASSUMPTIONS THAT

139
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,568
GOVERNOR OUR SOCIETY AND NO ONE

140
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,937
EVER EXAMINES THEM IN THE LIGHT

141
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:11,370
OF DAY.

142
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,004
YOU JUST DID.

143
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:13,673
WHEN YOU SAY SAFETY FIRST, AURE

144
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,074
SUMMING SOMEONE OUT THERE CARES

145
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:16,676
MORE ABOUT YOUR WELL-BEING THAN

146
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:19,112
YOU -- YOU ASSUME THAT SOMEONE

147
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:20,213
OUT THERE CARES MORE ABOUT YOUR

148
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:22,048
WELL-BEING THAN YOU DO?

149
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,851
>> YEAH, ON "DIRTY JOBS" MY CREW

150
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,085
AND I SAT THROUGH OVER 100

151
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:26,652
MANDATORY BRIEFINGS.

152
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:27,620
THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE OF

153
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,521
SEASONS, THEY WERE VERY

154
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:29,388
EFFECTIVE, BECAUSE WE LISTENED

155
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:30,022
LIKE THIS.

156
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:31,257
WE WERE VERY CONCERNED.

157
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:33,893
WE WERE IN A DANGEROUS, HOSTILE,

158
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:34,427
UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT.

159
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:35,962
BUT OVER TIME, THE BIG SAFETY

160
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:43,703
FIRST PLAQARTS AND THE MANDATORY

161
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:44,437
BOXES YOU HAVE TO CHECK AND THE

162
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,206
LOCK IN AND LOCK OUT PROCEDURES,

163
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,208
THOSE THINGS TURN INTO THE

164
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,645
TEACHER IN CHARLIE BROWN.

165
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:54,080
WAH-WAH-WAH.

166
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,148
YOU STOP LISTENING.

167
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:56,349
THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

168
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:58,317
TELLING YOU NOTHING IS MORE

169
00:04:58,317 --> 00:04:59,085
IMPORTANT THAN YOUR SAFETY IS

170
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:01,521
THE VERY DYNAMIC THAT HAS PEOPLE

171
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,190
WALK ACROSS FIFTH AVENUE WHEN

172
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,625
THE LITTLE MAN SAYS WALK INSTEAD

173
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,559
OF LOOKING BOTH WAYS.

174
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,427
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THE MOST

175
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:09,796
DANGEROUS INTERSECTIONS IN THE

176
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:11,130
WORLD ARE INTERSECTION THAT HAS

177
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,864
HAVE SIGNS TO TELL WHEN YOU TO

178
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:12,165
WALK.

179
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:13,566
AGAIN, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS

180
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,301
WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE, WE'VE

181
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:16,502
TALKED ABOUT IT WITH A LOT OF

182
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:17,370
DIFFERENT THINGS BUT THE

183
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,205
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

184
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,174
MAGNIFYING A VIRTUE TO A PLACE

185
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:22,675
IT DOESN'T DESERVE TO OCCUPY

186
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,911
WILL ALWAYS COME BACK TO KICK US

187
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:25,344
IN THE THROAT.

188
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:27,246
>> Tucker: REALLY DEEP.

189
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:29,549
