>> THE NRA HAS RESPONDED TO THE
SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE
YOUTUBE CAMPUS IN SAN BRUNO
CALIFORNIA AND THEY HAVE
ESSENTIALLY COME UP WITH ALL
SORTS OF TALKING POINTS AND
EXCUSES AND ORDERED TO ANY REAL
CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS IN
AMERICA.
THE SHOOTER OPENED FIRE AND DID
NOT LUCKILY KILL ANYONE.
THREE PEOPLE WERE INJURED, THEN
SHE KILLED HERSELF WITH A
GUNSHOT WOUND.
WITH THAT SAID THE NRA HAD AN
INTERESTING TAKE INITIALLY.
THE FIRST THING THEY WANTED TO
TALK ABOUT WAS YOUTUBE INVITING
HATRED AMONG THEMSELVES.
CHUCK HOLTON SAID 
THE FOLLOWING.
>> THAT'S GREAT, EVERYONE WHO
WAS SHOT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, BUT
WOULD YOU CARE.
WE WILL MAKE FUN OF LIBERAL
CALIFORNIA, SOME OF THEM WERE
SHOT AND ONLY SOME OF THEM
WERE TERRIFIED.
BUT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO SELL
GUNS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
YOU'RE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND
BLAME YOUTUBE ñ
>>THAT IS WHAT THE NRA DOES,
THEY BLAMED THE PARK WHEN
STUDENTS AND ESSENTIALLY MOCKED
THEM AND SET ALL SORTS OF
TERRIBLE THINGS BECAUSE THEY
WANTED GUN CONTROL AFTER
SEEING THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR
TEACHERS GET GUN DOWN.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY WOULD
CONTINUE VICTIMIZING THE VICTIMS
IN THIS CASE.
>> THEY SPEND $50 MILLION IN THE
LAST CAMPAIGN BUYING POLITICIANS
INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YOU
WANT.
YOU GET GUNNED DOWN, WE WILL
BLAME IT ON YOU.
>>SO
THEY BLAMED YOUTUBE IN THAT WAY.
THEY HAVE BEEN PUSHING THIS
NARRATIVE THAT YOUTUBE IS BAD
FOR A WHILE NOW.
YOUTUBE HAD BASICALLY PASSED A
POLICY REGARDING POLICY.
AFTER THE SHOOTING APARTMENT IN
FLORIDA THEY GOT A POLICY SAYING
WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE
TO PROMOTE THE SALE OF GUNS.
YOU CAN STILL HAVE CONTENT ON
YOUTUBE WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT
GUNS.
IF YOU WANTED TO SHOW THE
FEATURES OF A GUN YOU PURCHASE,
THAT IS FINE BUT WE ARE NOT
GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE
YOUTUBE AS AN ADVERTISING TO
SELL GUNS.
OF COURSE THAT HAS BEEN
MISCONSTRUED BY ñ
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A VIDEO
FROM NRA TV IN LATE MARCH.
TAKE A LOOK.
>>THERE IS NO SECRET THE LEFT OF
AN AGENDA THAT REVOLVES AROUND
CENSURING SPEECH THEY DON'T
AGREE WITH.
LAST WEEK TOWNHALL.COM REPORTED
YOUTUBE CENSORING OF A FIREARM
SAFETY TRAINING VIDEO, BANNING
CHANNELS THAT ARE RUN BY
DONE COMPANIES.
THE NRA'S INSTITUTE FOR
LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR CHRIS COX RESPONDED TO
YOUTUBE CENSORSHIP SAYING THIS.
I WILL TELL YOU CHRIS COX
IS SPOT ON.
>> WHAT'S ACTUALLY HEAR FROM
YOUTUBE AND THE NEW YORK TIMES.
AND SO THEY ARE MISREPRESENTING
THE TIME ñ
>> LET'S GO OVER SIMPLE THINGS.
THE NRA ACTUALLY KNOWS BUT THEY
ARE DOING PROPAGANDA.
YOUTUBE IS A PRIVATE COMPANY, OR
PART OF GOOGLE THEY ARE A PUBLIC
COMPANY, BUT THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT, THEY ARE
NOT THE GOVERNMENT.
IF THEY SAY HEY I DON'T WANT
THESE PRODUCTS THAT KILL PEOPLE
WHETHER IT IS A CIGARETTE OR A
GUN OR WHATEVER TO HAVE THESE
VIDEOS ON MY OUTLET.
THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN THE
WORLD TO DO THAT.
WHY ARE YOU STILL CRYING?
I
GUESS YOU THINK YOUTUBE IS SO
AWESOME THAT IF YOU ARE NOT ON
YOUTUBE YOU ARE DEVASTATED.
NUMBER TWO, ONE OF YOU EXPECT
THE SAME OLD ABC?
WHAT WEIRD
STANDARD.
ABC BUT LET ME RUN PROPAGANDA
FOR GUN MANUFACTURERS.
>> DOES ABC BAN THAT TYPE
OF CONTENT?
>>ABC GETS TO MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT PROGRAMS THEY HAVE ON
THEIR, RIGHT?
THEY HAVE THE ONES
THEY WANT, AND THE ONES THEY
DON'T WANT ARE NOT ON.
NOBODY GOES AROUND SAYING ABC
CENSORED ME BECAUSE THEY
DIDN'T PUT MY SHOW ON.
IT'S WHERE DIFFERENT RULES.
AND FINALLY ENTER A TV IF YOU
DON'T KNOW IS PAID FOR THROUGH
DONATIONS THAT GUN MANUFACTURERS
GIVE TO THE NRA.
IS LITERALLY MEANT AS A KIND OF
A QVC OF GUN MANUFACTURERS TO
SUBTLY AND SOMETIMES NOT SO
SUBTLY PUSH MY GUNS INTO THE
MARKET SO YOU WILL BUY THEM AND
THEY WILL MAKE MORE MONEY.
>> TO YOUR POINT ON THAT, THEY
HAVE ALREADY USED THIS SHOOTING
AT THE YOUTUBE CAMPUS TO PUSH
FOR MORE GUN SALES.
HERE'S THE TYPE OF FEAR
MONGERING THE NRA USED IN THE
COMMENTARY FOLLOWING THE
SHOOTING.
THEY 
ARE BLAMING YOUTUBE FOR NOT
HAVING THE PROPER SECURITY
MEASURES TO PREVENT THE
SHOOTER TO GAIN ACCESS.
SO THAT FEAR MONGERING IT IS
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.
THERE'S ALWAYS CRITICISM FROM
EXTREME GUN ADVOCATES REGARDING
POLITICIZING A MASS SHOOTING OR
A SHOOTING SITUATION.
WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE DOING
HERE?
THEY ARE POLITICIZING IT
AND EXPLOITING IT TO SELL MORE
GUNS AND SO FEAR IN COMMUNITIES
AND CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU NEED
TO GIVE UP ALL YOUR PRIVACY
RIGHTS AND GO TO WORK WHERE YOU
HAVE TO WALK THROUGH METAL
DETECTORS AND HAVE CLEAR
BACKPACKS AND PURSES AND MAKE
SURE YOU ARM YOURSELF AS WELL.
>>THE IDEA IS ANYBODY CAN
SHOOT YOU AT ANY TIME.
THEY SAY GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE,
PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.
THAT IS THE DUMBEST STATEMENT IN
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
YES IF YOU HAVE AN EX-LOVER SPOT
AS WHEN HE ALLUDED TO THE PERSON
COULD KILL YOU, YOUR WIFE OR
YOUR GIRLFRIEND COULD KILL YOU
WITH HER BARE HANDS BUT IT IS A
LOT HARDER, THAT IS WHY
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GUN CONTROL
HAVE VERY LITTLE DEATHS, LIKE
JAPAN, THEY ONLY HAVE 13.
WE ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE
30/30,000 DEATHS BY GUNS.
IT'S
NOT THAT WE HAVE A CRAZIER
POPULATION, IT IS THAT WE ARE ñ
OUR ENTIRE POPULATION INCLUDING
THE RAGE PERSON ñ WHAT DO THE
GUN MANUFACTURERS SAY?
THE ANSWER IS HUMAN TO THEM
FIRST WITH THE GUN THAT I SOLD
YOU.
UNSURPRISING THAT THAT WOULD BE
HER ANSWER IF YOU MAKE MONEY
SELLING GUNS.
