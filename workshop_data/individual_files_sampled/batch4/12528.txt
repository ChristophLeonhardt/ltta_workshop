the media of course have every interest in blowing up everything bad about President Trump to inordinate heights of outrage and that's not helping either so the media continue to take very seriously Omarosa Manigault even though she has had nothing that's what's really astonishing about the Omarosa Manigault story so Omarosa is going around talking incessantly about all of the tapes she has she has not released one seriously damning thing about the Trump administration she really hasn't now all she said is that she didn't get along with Trump she can get along with John Kelly and now she says Trump was a racist after spending years talking about a wonderful president Trump was and had literally bow before him now she's going around and she has her in strange new respect from the media so she's gotten most of that strange new respect courtesy of the folks over at places like MSNBC in a grand meeting of the minds al Sharpton had on Omarosa on MSNBC over the weekend and they were talking about race from Al Sharpton a man who is legitimately participated in the inception of race riots in places like New York Rama Rosen talking with Al Sharpton race baiter par excellence about why Donald Trump is gonna start a race war we have a lot to lose and in fact we're losing right now because Donald Trump is disingenuous about his engagement in his outreach and in fact I believe he wants to start a race war in this country no for a lady who was fired from the administration did not quit it's pretty wild for her to suggest that Trump wants to start a race war in the country it's particularly rich for her to be saying this to a guy who legitimately has started race riots in the United States who at least allegedly been involved with the inception of those race riots particularly the 1991 race right and Crown Heights that claimed the life of North Attacks Jew but I guess that the media have to be treated with respect here al sharpton certainly has to be treated with respect the worst battery of Al Sharpton's weekend was not actually his interview with Omarosa it was the lead-up to his interview with Omarosa this is real I'm not making this up this is a thing that actually happened on national television is it fair to say al Sharpton is a dummy I think that based on Clips like this the the ongoing battle between Al Sharpton and his teleprompter is one of the great battles in human history I mean it really is like the it's like the Battle of Stalingrad really Gail Sharpton versus his teleprompter so here is the best clip of the weekend Bar None it's just fantastic you know what they say about payback it's a real you I'm sure you know the word I'm thinking of so in the words of my late friend Aretha Franklin and show some RESP ICT oh my goodness well you just hope that out Al Sharpton is never in a position where he's on wheel of fortune and you have the art of the S the P to see on the T and then you has to buy a vowel because my goodness our it's literally her most famous song resp ICT tell us what it means to Al Sharpton ah just fantastic stuff I can't imagine why folks don't take the media seriously
