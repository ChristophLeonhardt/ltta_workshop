00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,470
payments then then you might find

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,199
someone remember cleanse our people to

17
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,450
doing it would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been done already</font>

18

you fall behind the longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

23
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,910

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,860
reflection I've found it so sad how

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,579
whole families can be torn apart by just

34
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:42,860
really simple things like wild dogs I

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,470
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be indecisive but now I'm just</font>

36
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,140
not sure they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that love is blind but</font>

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,600

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,840
lying got a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> tip here for saving it</font>

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,899
says borrow from pessimists because he

40
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,240
bought from pessimists I mean

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,320
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expect to get the money</font>

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,390

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,970
so lately I've been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to daydream</font>

44
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,040
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can't I mean my mind keeps</font>

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,199
wandering hard work never<font color="#CCCCCC"> killed anyone</font>

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,330
but why chance it I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

47
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,690
schizophrenic but now we're all right

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,459
actually have 18 lives I'm always told

50
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,709
that hard work pays off in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future</font>

51
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">but to be honest laziness deadly pays up</font>
