nine black people were shot and killed in Chicago this weekend so blacks rioted in Milwaukee Milwaukee blacks were protesting the fact that police had shot and killed silversmith a robbery suspect with a long criminal record who was brandishing a stolen gun rioters swarmed the Milwaukee streets chanting we demand that we take responsibility for our own lives and stop blaming white people for our troubles we are going to burn the city down until we stop having children out of wedlock whom we don't take care of so that they join gangs and use drugs there will be no peace until our young men stop acting like thugs and we all join with the police to help curtail the violent crime in our neighborhood and possibly I didn't hear those chants correctly it was very noisy because of all the rioting black lives matter spokesman sojourner crap no relation to Sojourner Truth told reporters quote we demand that these police stop shooting innocent robbery suspects with long criminal records who are brandishing stolen guns before you know it a robbery suspect with a long criminal record won't be able to walk down the street brandishing a stolen gun without some bigoted cop killing him this poor young man never even had a chance to unleash some rounds on his fellow gangbangers in the hood so a stray bullet could go through a window and kill a child doing his homework something we could all happily ignore unquote President Barack Obama spoke out about the police shooting saying that if he had had a son he would have looked like Sylvia Smith except for the private school uniform and the contingent of armed guards surrounding him at every minute and the fact he lived in a big white mansion the process not to call for peace saying quote I will continue to speak out stirring up black anger with false statistics until each and every person in America is not paying attention to the fact that I've regulated the economy to a standstill and allow the Middle East to go up in flames then once I've made black people angry enough for them to murder and riot I will call for peace with a sad serious expression that makes me look like I give a damn about anything besides my agenda unquote Harvard Black Studies professor Wittering articulate told an interviewer quote Milwaukee hasn't had a fully Republican mayor since 1908 so it's time we got out there and voted in some more Democrats to make sure conditions in black neighborhoods continued to deteriorate otherwise let's face it I'm out of work unquote meanwhile in Chicago where there hasn't been a Republican mayor since 1933 and where guns are among the most restrictive in the country there were at least 27 shootings this weekend alone Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters quote just vote Democrat restrict guns I don't have time to say more I have to get off the street before I get my ass killed oh man oh man the Clavin was weakened the Clay Milwaukee didn't know what hit Louisiana is underwater Milwaukee is on fire oh you know I would work all the time except I just don't care enough that's all right we are on we're gonna talk about this right because this is a disaster this is awful it really is genuinely awful what's happening to this country and it is all the fault of our friends on the left we you can watch the first 15 minutes of this on Facebook and then you have to come to the Daily wire you can get it later on iTunes or on soundcloud and if you subscribe you can watch the entire thing you won't get cut off at all and you can send questions in the mailbag also if you would like to preorder a copy of my memoir the great good thing the secular Jew comes to faith in Christ I will you can send the receipt to me and I will send to the a Clavin at Dailey wire comm and I will send you a sticker with an autograph that you can put in the book all right let us talk about this is a nightmare in Milwaukee Saturday afternoon a couple of cops do a traffic stop they see some suspicious activity in a vehicle the guy gets out he's a suspect in a robbery not only did he steal a gun but he stole 500 rounds of ammunition he starts running he's got a gun with 23 rounds in it and somehow he ends up dead who could who could ever have imagined that a policeman would shoot a man just for being a robbery sight this guy's been in trouble with the law and by the way not that it should matter but we know it does the cop was also african-american so he's a black cop riots break out city goes up in flames that break they broke out again last night there were gunshots fired somebody was shot last night they set a gas station on fire they said business is on fire let's take a look at just a little bit of the writing and listen to what these people are saying right now white person come down Charmian hey why is targeting white people he's white let's beat him up you know it's I mean it's really I gotta say if you are a black guy black girl making his way in the world like the rest of us this has got to break it's got to break your heart I mean you got to look at this and just put your head in your hands I mean when people shout black power or any kind of power while they're burning things down everybody's got that power everybody's got the power to destroy things there's nobody who hasn't you know I mean you sit with a one-year-old and you build a tower of blocks he knocks it down why because he can that's the power that he has so you know I mean it's a lot easier to burn a gas station than to run a gas station a lot easier to burn businesses and crash their glass then to run a business and anyway I hate to laugh but it's got kind of this mordant Lee funny here's one rider explaining why this is happening it's sad because you know this will happen because they're not helping the black community like you know the rich people they got all this money and they not like you know trying to give us not you know I have that problem too more money than me you won't give the money to me you know I mean that what that is that's what we're gonna be talking about today we're gonna be talking about ideas what you are seeing when you see this as you were seeing ideas in action and you wonder why you know every day I get these attacks you know why do you attack Donald Trump when he's the only thing we've got against Hillary and why do you attack Hillary and all this stuff it's because ideas are what motivate people you know Myron magnet a friend of mine wrote a brilliant book called the dream and the nightmare about how the 60s went wrong and it contains the sentence that I'm not quoting verbatim but it's something like people act because of the ideas in their heads they act out the ideas in their heads and that's what we're talking about where do these ideas come from let's just stop for a sec and talk about the police stop itself just so we're clear about this it well here's the police chief of the Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn describing how the stop took place is the first lengua I was advised it was a suspicions they thought this vehicle was behaving in a suspicious manner it's a rental car it turns out we have not ascertained its status as to whether or not it was lawfully rented or stolen or held over we don't know but this event I did look at the tape and I can tell you this event probably took twenty to twenty-five seconds I mean there was virtually no time between the officer unhooking his seatbelt turning on his body camera getting out of the car and immediately he was in a foot chase and that foot chase went maybe a few dozen feet before he encountered this individual in in a fenced yard boarded by two houses not really an alleyway but a way between two houses and the incident occurred very very rapidly yeah so it was very fast the individual was armed and the individual did turned toward the officer with a firearm in his hand and the officer can't tell when the officer discharges his firearm because there was a list with many body-worn cameras certainly all of ours there's a 30-second delay before the audio kicks on I don't know when the shots were fired okay so it drives me crazy that we even have to talk about this guy gets out of a car fell this guy's been in trouble with the law we only the only reason we don't know how long is because his juvenile records are sealed basically it was charged with intimidating a witness which is a very very vicious and serious thing to do you know he's charged with all kinds of crimes he gets out of a car with a gun the police stopped him you know what do you do you put your hands on the steering wheel and say what he breaks out of the car he runs he's got a gun he's brandishing the gun I don't think we have a right to parse what this cop did I really don't you know I'm not a worship I really respect the police and I'm so grateful that they're out there but I understand the police do bad things and have to be held to account I think the police understand that as well but that's not the point you get out of a car with a gun and you're brandishing the gun you're a dead man as far as I'm concerned that you know that you've written your own epitaph and my your epitaph was I was an idiot and the police killed me because of it that's the that's what should be on your headstone you know and I'd say has nothing to do with not feeling for the parents or the brothers and the sisters were out there crying saying saying give me interviews like oh they should have tased him now tell me they should have tased him you know you know what are you talking about to have like a black and blue mark on his leg because of this guy I didn't let alone risk him getting shot so here is the outspoken Sheriff David Clarke the Milwaukee sheriff we've all seen him he goes on fox news all the time and he's just always hammering at Obama for being the instigator of a lot of this and he talks about what this stop was like if you're on the ground these things are tragic situations every time an officer has to use force no officer wants to do it it is the last resort and the actions of the matter here are important he was armed and I'm just because you're not armed because I always say unarmed does not mean that dangerous but this would appeared the pier of no offense you know these cop haters can't State Police shoot unarmed man so you look at a lot of things and this guy didn't deserve to die but he's the co actor his own demise some people can't stomach there a lot of sounds cruel but it's the truth you get on a car with a handgun in your hand when you confront the police bad things are going to happen not doing fault to the officer the officer is not required and I never want officers to get to a state where they have to let the perpetrator rank the first-mover have to get shot at or have the gun pointed at a gun in the hand down here told cop it's very quick from here to here that's it's very quick from here to here that's exactly right and everything he says there's who the guys you know co-actor in his own demise it's not like oh we're glad he's dead it's not like he deserved to die no nobody was disturbed to die that's what the Bible tells us you know we either we all deserve to die or nobody deserves to die that's not that's not the point he was that is a perfect description a co actor in his own demise on himself is another way of putting that and the other thing is is the guys would then go out and riot right they have their own agenda they're not out there reaping for this guy they're not trying to save black lives we know that we know that the black I mean you know the murder rate in Chicago I think it was this week in nine people died in Chicago you know there were black you know the you know the people who killed them were black nothing nothing from these but BLM people but it's all about this and they're gonna make a fuss o'clock one of the things Clark realizes is they are not about the lives of people no matter what their title of their organization is they are about their agenda he talked about it here I looked at some of the particulars of that shootings robberies those lines about the truth and they don't seem to I know why because this other one this police is a political construct and that's not a political construct but I think it shows the the holiness of the contradictory nature of this ideology I think it's a shame exploiting this for some political reason and you know at some point I think the public's gonna get it I really do you're gonna be exposed for what this thing really is it's a thinly veiled anarchist movement just trying to incite chaos threatening institutions we have police are a government institution we stand on the front lines of ordered liberty you want to attack ordered Liberty have the chaos you saw last night kept attack please get to it right exactly the police of the thin blue line to protect ordered Liberty it is you know the thing is the police are not the purpose of the police we are the purpose of the police the guy who writes a book the guy who has an idea the guy who invents a computer we are the purpose that stuff doesn't happen when the city is on fire that stuff doesn't happen when you can't go out to get a pack of gum without getting mugged that you know New York changed New York City and I was there was a hellhole it was a hellhole that was going down the drain and it was only the kind of tough policing that the Obama administration is now attacking in every way it can only the kind of tough policing they call it they call it what do they call it there's no I can't remember they have some yeah it's broken windows policing but they basically say there's no you know we have no tolerance that's it zero tolerance no cop uses that phrase no cop uses the phrase zero tolerance the cops are in the business of tolerating the small things people do but if you don't stop them from urinating against the wall from painting on the wall if you don't stop those little crimes the neighborhood becomes a place the Predators see as their territory and that was the idea behind broken windows pollute policing but it's more than that and we're gonna talk about that in a minute but first we have to say goodbye to our friends on Facebook charge
