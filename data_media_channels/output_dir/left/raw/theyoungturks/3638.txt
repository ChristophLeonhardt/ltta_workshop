1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
AXIOS REPORTS THAT TRUMP MIGHT
FIRE SECRETARY OF STATE REX

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,560
TILLERSON, AND HE MAY GIVE THE
JOB TO WHO?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,899
CIA DIRECTOR MIKE

4
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,450
POMPEO.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,480
THIS IS ALL RUMOR BUT
YOU'VE HEARD IT MULTIPLE PLACES,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,790
IN THE WAKE OF THE STATEMENT YOU
ALL HEARD REPORTED, WHICH IS

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,670
THAT REX TILLERSON REFERRED TO
THE PRESIDENT AS AN EFFING

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,460
MORON, AND REALLY BEFORE THAT IF
YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION,

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,150
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STRIFE
BETWEEN THEM.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,470
AXIOS BROKE THE

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,380
STORY, THEY SAY THE RELATIONSHIP
IS BEYOND REPAIR --

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:39,150
>>WHO IS HE, VINCE VAUGHN?

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,340
>>I ROCKED VEGAS --

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:53,240
>>MAY BE A JEALOUSY THING.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
NEXT, THEY SAID --

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:15,110
>>DO YOU BUY IT?

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,180
>>DO I BUY WHAT?

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,960
>>THAT HE'S GOING TO FIRE REX
TILLERSON?

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,159
>>YEAH.

20
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,500
FIRST OF ALL, TRUMP IS
UNPREDICTABLE, SO HE COULD DO

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
ANYTHING.

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,100
HE COULD FIRE HIMSELF.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,740
>>GOD, I HOPE HE DOES.

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,530
>>WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,980
I
THINK DEFINITELY THE THING THAT

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,479
BOTHERED HIM WAS HIM NOT DENYING
THAT HE CALLED HIM A MORON

27
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,479
OUTRIGHT.

28
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,350
THAT WOULD DRIVE
ANYBODY CRAZY.

29
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,970
SECOND OF ALL,

30
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:59,299
YES, TILLERSON DOMINATED THE
MEDIA CYCLE, OR THE NEWS CYCLE,

31
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,979
AND TRUMP LIVES ON THAT.

32
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,740
THAT'S
ALL HE CARES ABOUT.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,740
AND OF

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,280
COURSE HE GOT BEATEN OUT BY THAT
GUY SO HE WANTS TO GET RID OF

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
HIM.

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,710
I DON'T WANT THAT BY
STEALING MY TV TIME.

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,580
THAT'S THE LEVEL TRUMP OPERATES
ON.

38
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,880
NO DEEPER.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,380
>>HE CALLED TRUMP A FUCKING
MORON, ABSOLUTELY.

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,670
>>ONE OF THE THINGS OF WHAT HE
DID IT, HE CALLED HIM A MORON

41
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,590
BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S AFGHANISTAN
STRATEGY, AND SPECIFICALLY THE

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,680
WAY WE'VE CHANGED IT IS THE
OVERTURNED REQUIREMENT THAT THE

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,120
TROOPS BE IN THE AREA OF ENEMY
FORCES BEFORE THEY FIRED.

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
OUR

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,960
HEAD DIPLOMAT IN THE COUNTRY IS
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS, AND

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,180
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
ALLOWING OUR JETS TO BOMB PEOPLE

47
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,390
WHATEVER THEY WANT, SO WHEN YOU
LOOK AT WHAT TILLERSON IS TRYING

48
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,790
TO DO AND WATCH HOW THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS MAKING IT

49
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,980
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO HIS
DIPLOMACY JOB, I CAN SEE WHY YOU

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,349
THINK THIS GUY IS A MORON AND
YOU GET ANGRY.

51
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,490
BUT INSTEAD OF

52
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,770
TALKING ABOUT POLICY WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS CYCLE,

53
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,260
THE PRIORITIES ARE SO OFF.

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,270
BUT
TILLERSON, HIS PRIORITIES ARE

55
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,681
CORRECT, HE CALLED HIM A MORON
FOR A GOOD REASON, OUR

56
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,430
AFGHANISTAN STRATEGY IS KILLING
PEOPLE BY THINK I'M DEFENDING

57
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,520
THE EXXON MOBIL SECRETARY OF
STATE, THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT,

58
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
BUT HE'S AN ADULT.

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,520
>>IT'S SO WEIRD THAT I'M ON THE
SIDE OF REX TILLERSON.

60
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,620
>>WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO HAVE THIS
NEW POLICY IN AFGHANISTAN THAT

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,260
CAUSED HIM TO BE CALLED A MORON?

62
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,620
>>MATTIS IS PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT
IT.

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,180
MAD DOG.

64
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,410
>>TILLERSON WOULD ALSO BE
REFERRING TO MATTIS IS A MORON

65
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,060
TOO, BECAUSE HE'S FOR THIS
POLICY ALSO.

66
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,060
>>POSSIBLY.

67
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,209
>>AT LEAST THAT WAS BASED ON
POLICY.

68
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,860
>>IN CONTEXT I'M LIKE, YES, GO
TILLERSON.

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,510
>>HERE ARE THE REASONS MIKE
POMPEO MIGHT BE A REPLACEMENT,

70
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,569
THEY SAY HE'S CLOSE TO TRUMP, HE
DELIVERS THE DAILY PRESS BRIEF

71
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,480
TO TRUMP, HE'S NOT A SHOWBOAT,
HE WOULD TAKE THE JOB BECAUSE

72
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,879
IT'S A LOGICAL NEXT STEP, IT'S
ALL HE HASN'T DONE BESIDES

73
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,269
PRESIDENT, ESSENTIALLY, HE HAS
CREDIBILITY WITH WORLD LEADERS

74
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,209
BECAUSE HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE
ABLE TO BE IN THE PRESIDENT'S

75
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,209
EAR, BUT HERE IS A QUOTE --

76
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:29,289
>>THAT'S THE SKILL THAT PEOPLE
LIKE TILLERSON, WHO IS A

77
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,229
BUSINESSMAN, WHO IS LIKE --
THINGS TILLERSON DID WHEN HE

78
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,409
FIRST BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE
WAS, ESSENTIALLY, DON'T MAKE ME

79
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,279
REPORT BRIBES.

80
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,919
BECAUSE HE'S LIKE
I'M AN EXXON MOBIL GUY AND I

81
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,479
KNOW THAT SOMETIMES I HAVE TO
TALK TO HEADS OF STATE OR LOCAL

82
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,020
OLIGARCHS, SOMETIMES THEY'RE THE
SAME PERSON, AND IN ORDER TO GET

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,580
MY WELLS DRILLED THAT'S WHAT I
HAVE TO DO.

84
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
THEN HE LOOKS AT

85
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,770
DONALD TRUMP, HE MAKES BUILDINGS
THAT ARE GOLD AND THAT'S IT.

86
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,400
THAT'S HIS BUSINESS.

87
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,900
AND FOR
TRUMP, HE ONLY EVER NEEDS TO

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,659
TALK TO OLIGARCHS.

89
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:08,999
SO TRUMP IS
WORKING ON THIS LEVEL BUT

90
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:17,219
TILLERSON SEES HIMSELF AS BEING
ABOVE, AND THAT LEVEL IS BELOW

91
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:21,340
THAT, OSTENSIBLY,, OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE WORKED AT THE STATE

92
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,229
DEPARTMENT BEFORE, WHO HAVE
EXPERIENCED THAT, BUT THAT COMES

93
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,259
WITH ITS OWN DRAWBACKS BECAUSE
YOU ARE INSIDE THE SYSTEM AND

94
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,869
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES TO THE RIGHT
PEOPLE TO BUBBLE UP THERE, BUT

95
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:32,990
JUST TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE TWO, AND HAVE IT

96
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,650
POTENTIALLY BE HANDED OVER TO
POMPEO, WHO WAS THE HEAD OF THE

97
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,009
CIA, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO SAY
NICE THINGS -- OR BAD THINGS TO

98
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,309
THE PRESIDENT NICELY?

99
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,559
IT'S SO
FRUSTRATING.

100
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:48,279
>>LET'S FLASH BACK AND REMEMBER
WHO POMPEO IS, HE WAS A

101
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,119
CONGRESSMAN IN THE TEA PARTY
WAVE, HE WAS A KOCH BROTHERS

102
00:05:53,119 --> 00:06:00,249
CONGRESSMAN.

103
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,930
YOU HAVE THE EXXON
MOBIL GUY, NOW THE KOCH BROTHERS

104
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,509
CONGRESSMAN, HE CLEARLY KNOWS
HOW TO KISS ASS.

105
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,509
THE KOCH

106
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:12,680
BROTHERS GAVE HIM $375,000, 14%
OF HIS FUNDING FOR CONGRESS CAME

107
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,520
FROM OIL AND GAS INTERESTS.

108
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,619
IF
YOU WERE GOING TO GET RID OF

109
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,379
TILLERSON, THEY ARE JUST
REPLACING FOSSIL FUEL GUY WITH

110
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,949
ANOTHER FOSSIL FUEL GUY AND WHEN
I LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE OF

111
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,849
WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN WITH
TRUMP, I KNOW REAL ESTATE

112
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,009
DEVELOPERS WOULD HAVE A GOOD
TIME, AND RICH PEOPLE, I NEVER

113
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,550
THOUGHT FOSSIL FUELS WOULD BE
THIS CENTRAL TO THIS PARTICULAR

114
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,550
ADMINISTRATION.

115
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,699
THERE WAS NO
INDICATION OF THIS BEFOREHAND.

116
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,810
THAT'S WHY I'M UPSET ABOUT THE
POMPEO PICK, FOSSIL FUELS,

117
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,779
THEY'VE GOT A STRANGLEHOLD ON
THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION.

118
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,199
>>I THINK THEY'VE HAD A
STRANGLEHOLD ON OUR GOVERNMENT.

119
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,619
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER,
BUT BEFORE HE LEFT OFFICE BARACK

120
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,360
OBAMA WAS WHEN TO LET THAT
SITUATION IN NORTH DAKOTA PLAY

121
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,619
OUT. AND THE REASON WE HAVE ALL
THESE FRACKING PIPES IS BECAUSE

122
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,479
BARACK OBAMA LIFTED THE
RESTRICTION OF EXPORTING FOSSIL

123
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,789
FUELS FROM OUR COUNTRY, WHICH IS
WHY IT IS NOW CRISSCROSSED WITH

124
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:10,419
FRACKING PIPES.

125
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,129
TRUMP JUST TAKES
THE PRETTY FACE OF THE HORRIBLE

126
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,990
SHIT THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN DOING SINCE BILL CLINTON.

127
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,909
>>IT PUTS YOU IN A WEIRD
POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE TO

128
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,190
EITHER JUDGE THE BEHAVIOR OF
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT

129
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,309
THEY ARE DOING, OR HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION AS TO WHETHER THIS

130
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,430
PERSON KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY
ARE DOING.

131
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,430
OR ANYTHING ABOUT

132
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,430
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

133
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,599
WITH OBAMA
-- I GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING --

134
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,449
>>OBAMA OPEN TO THE ARCTIC TO
DRILLING.

135
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,259
>>AS PART OF A STRATEGY, IT
COULD BE CLAIMED, TO LOWER THE

136
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,899
PRICE OF GAS AND DESTABILIZE THE
PEOPLE IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE

137
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,899
WORLD.

138
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,210
IT'S TOTALLY BUSINESS AND
COMMERCE BASED, DESTABILIZE

139
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,619
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT RELY ON
FOSSIL FUEL EXPORTS, AND YOU'VE

140
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,909
SEEN THAT BEAR OUT.

141
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,429
WE MAKE THE
OIL NOW, AND MORE ENERGY, AND SO

142
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:05,800
NOW THE MIDDLE EAST IS FURTHER
DESTABILIZED, AS RUSSIA IS AS

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,740
WELL, AND THAT'S WHY PUTIN HATES
OBAMA AND HILLARY, BECAUSE THEY

144
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,339
COST HIM JILLIANS OF DOLLARS.

145
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,860
AT
LEAST I CAN WRAP MY MIND AROUND

146
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,659
IT, I'M NOT SAYING WHAT OBAMA
DID WAS GOOD, BUT I CAN WRAP MY

147
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:28,659
MIND AROUND THAT IT MAKES SENSE
AS AN APPROACH.

148
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,649
THIS ONE,

149
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:38,159
THERE'S A GOOD COP/BAD COP THING
TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO, BUT

150
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,168
THERE'S NO ABILITY TO BELIEVE
THAT THE GOOD COP CAN DO

151
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,169
ANYTHING.

152
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,490
NOW YOU'VE GOT
TILLERSON WHO GOES UP AND SAYS

153
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,290
THINGS LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO
TALK, WE CAN TALK TO THE NORTH

154
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,010
KOREANS AND HAVE A DISCUSSION,
THEN YOU HAVE TRUMP SAYING NAH,

155
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,290
DON'T TALK TO ROCKET MAN WITH
THE CHINA THING.

156
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,510
SO TILLERSON

157
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:04,650
GOES AND TALKS TO CHINA AND
CHINA SAYS WE WILL EXERT MORE

158
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,210
PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA IF WE
CAN REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT

159
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:16,170
AMERICA WON'T START A WAR. AND
TRUMP JUST COMPLETELY UNDERMINED

160
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,320
THE REASONABLY BELIEVE PART.

161
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
THAT'S WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING,

162
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,011
MAYBE YOU REPLACE TILLERSON WITH
POMPEO, BUT WHAT IS TO SAY THAT

163
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:29,030
TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO KEEP BEING
THIS CRAZY BAD COP?

164
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,030
THIS IS

165
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,780
EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS TO BE,
IT'S HIS FANTASY, LIKE HE'S

166
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,880
JIZZING ALL OVER THE WORLD, I
GET TO BE THE BAD COP, I'M

167
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,990
FROM NEW YORK.

168
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,720
>>THE ONE THING TRUMP IS GOOD AT
IS MANIPULATING THE PRESS.

169
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
HE

170
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,140
LEARNED EARLY IN HIS CAREER IN
THE 80S, HOW TO STEAL A NEWS

171
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,560
CYCLE, IF YOU GET HEAT ABOUT ONE
THING, YOU SAY SOMETHING MORE

172
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,160
OUTRAGEOUS AND THEY WILL FOLLOW
THAT, THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN

173
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,560
DOING OVER AND OVER, AND I
WOULDN'T DOUBT, I THINK ACTUALLY

174
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,530
THE CHANCES ARE, THAT HIM SAYING
THAT STUFF ABOUT THE CALM BEFORE

175
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,530
THE STORM, THAT'S JUST HIM
TRYING TO GRAB THE HEADLINES

176
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,530
BACK.

177
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,890
NOW EVERYONE IS GOING
NUTS, WHAT DID HE MEAN?

178
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,890
EVERYONE

179
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,440
IS BACK TALKING ABOUT TRUMP, IT
IS OFF TILLERSON AND THE

180
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,110
MORON COMMENT, HE JUST STOLE
THE NEWS CYCLE AGAIN.

181
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,660
IT'S PROBABLY AS SHALLOW AS
THAT.

182
00:10:28,660 --> 00:00:00,000
>>AND WE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM
THE GUN DISCUSSION ALREADY.
