1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,070
THE MOVIE ALL THE MONEY IN
THE WORLD WAS SET FOR A DECEMBER

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,440
RELEASE BUT JUST A MONTH BEFORE
SUDDENLY EVERYTHING BECAME

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,840
UNCERTAIN BECAUSE ONE OF THE

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,230
MOVIE STARS WAS LINKED TO A LOT
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,350
THE MOVIE COULD'VE BEEN PULLED
BUT INSTEAD WHAT THEY WHAT THEY

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,410
DID WAS DO RE-SHOOTS TO TAKE OUT
KEVIN SPACEY AND PUT A

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,270
DIFFERENT ACTOR IN HIS PLACE.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,200
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT IN THE
MOVIE DID NOT EVEN HAVE TO BE

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,080
DELAYED.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,899
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE RE-SHOOTS
ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR THEM.

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,500
IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME OF THE
FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
RE-SHOOTS.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,929
THE PROBLEM COMES IN NOW NOT
WITH KEVIN SPACEY BUT WITH

14
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:47,120
MARK WAHLBERG AND MICHELLE
WILLIAMS.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,039
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PAY
FOR THE RE-SHOOTS.

16
00:00:52,039 --> 00:01:13,020
THAT IS 
AS BIG AS OF A

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,330
DISPARITY AS YOU CAN HAVE.

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,330
SOME

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,399
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE

20
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,590
SYSTEM, THIS IS PURELY ABOUT

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,520
AGENTS WHICH COULD BE TRUE BUT
THEY ARE BOTH REPRESENTED BY

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,280
WME.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,320
NO ONE FROM THOSE COMPANIES HAVE
RESPONDED TO CONCERNS OR

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,999
QUESTIONS, BUT THEY HAVE THE
SAME AGENCY.

25
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,079
THEY BOTH HAVE TOP-TIER
REPRESENTATION.

26
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,009
I HAVE ALSO SEEN THE MOVIE, IT
COULD'VE BEEN THEORETICALLY

27
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,530
THAT IF MARK WAHLBERG WAS IN A
TON OF SCENES, AND SHE WASN'T,

28
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,299
THEN MAYBE HE SHOULD BE
PAID MORE.

29
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,450
BUT THEY BOTH SHARE LOTS OF
SCENES TOGETHER.

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,219
THIS IS NOT LOOKING GOOD
FOR HOLLYWOOD.

31
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,589
ESPECIALLY DAYS AFTER THE
GOLDEN GLOBES.

32
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:07,600
>> DO I KNOW WHY IT HAPPENS
DEFINITIVELY?

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,959
OF COURSE NOT NO ONE DOES.

34
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,030
I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
FACTORS INVOLVED.

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,940
ONE, SINCE WE ARE NOT IN THE
INDUSTRY AND NOT OLD-SCHOOL IT

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,720
MIGHT BLOW OUR MINDS HOW MUCH
DISCRIMINATION THERE ACTUALLY

37
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,000
IS.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,299
I REMEMBER WAY BACK IN THE DAY
WHEN I WAS A TV WRITER AND THEY

39
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:30,451
WERE TRYING TO PICK A HOST FOR A

40
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:36,530
SHOW ON ONE OF THE CABLE
STATIONS AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY

41
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,530
DISCRIMINATORY.

42
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,319
IT WAS SHOCKING HOW
DISCRIMINATORY IT WAS TALKING

43
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,650
ABOUT HOW THEY DON'T WANT IN NEW
YORK INTELLECTUAL LOOK.

44
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,680
>> I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
>>IT MEANS JEWISH.

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,940
THIS IS AT THE TIME WHEN
SEINFELD WAS THE NUMBER ONE

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,110
SHOW ON TV.

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:06,909
AND THEY SAID WE ARE LOOKING FOR
A MIDWESTERN LOOK, THAT MEANS

49
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,799
WHITE.

50
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,920
THEY HAD ALL THESE CODEWORDS.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,329
THEY MAY NOT EVEN THINK OR SAY
CONSCIOUSLY BUT IT MIGHT BE

52
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,269
THEIR STEREOTYPE ASSUMPTIONS.

53
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,629
BUT NOW IS GIVE YOU THE
DIFFERENT FACTORS, IT COULD ALSO

54
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:32,900
BE IN PART OR IN WHOLE THAT
WAHLBERG 単

55
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,799
THIS IS NOT THEIR MAIN SALARY
FOR THE MOVIE.

56
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,060
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR SALARY
FOR THE MOVIE IS, IT COULD BE

57
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
EQUAL.

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,310
>>I AM GOING TO BET IT IS NOT,
BUT IT COULD BE.

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,510
>>BUT WE DON'T KNOW.

60
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,469
THIS IS JUST FOR THE RE-SHOOTS.

61
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:53,260
IN THIS CASE, GIVE MICHELLE
WILLIAMS A TON OF CREDIT SHE

62
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,000
SAID SHE WAS THRILLED THEY WERE
RESHOOTING THOSE SCENES, SO SHE

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,560
WAS HAPPY TO DO IT BECAUSE THE
STUDIO WAS GOING THE EXTRA

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,150
DISTANCE AND SHE WAS
WILLING TO AS WELL.

65
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,920
SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST SAID GREAT.

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,950
AND WAHLBERG'S AGENTS WERE 単

67
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,640
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR
INTERPRETATION OF IT.

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,860
THEY PRESSED HIM AND THEY GOT
MORE MONEY, OR YOU MIGHT SAY

69
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,640
THEY WERE JERKS.

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,890
WE HAVE A SLIGHT CONFLICT OF
INTEREST WE ARE ALSO

71
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:41,360
REPRESENTED BY WME, THE COMPANY.

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,631
AND HENCE THE DISPARITY.

73
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:49,590
AND I DON'T KNOW THE INNER
WORKINGS THERE AT ALL BUT A LOT

74
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,630
OF THOSE AGENTS I WOULD BE
SURPRISED IF THEY SHARED

75
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,070
INFORMATION.

76
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,250
I'M SURE THEY SHARE IT ON SOME
SCALE BUT THEY MIGHT ALSO BE

77
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,260
REALLY COMPETITIVE WITH ONE

78
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,310
ANOTHER AND WAHLBERG'S AGENT
MIGHT BE LAUGHING AT MICHELLE

79
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:13,700
WILLIAMS 
AGENT SAYING I

80
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,020
DID BETTER.

81
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,860
>>WITH ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE
AGENTS, THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

82
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,100
THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ALSO KNOW
THAT PEOPLE WILL RESPOND TO

83
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,420
THE AGENTS OF MALE AND FEMALE
ACTORS DIFFERENTLY AS WELL.

84
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,010
FOR ME IT IS A PARTICULARLY
EGREGIOUS 単 NUMERICALLY

85
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,480
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS
TRYING TO BE FIXED RIGHT NOW.

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,700
WHEN THIS BROKE I WAS TALKING TO
MY GIRLFRIEND WHO IS A WORKING

87
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,850
ACTRESS WHO WAS THERE.

88
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,770
SHE WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH E,
THEY ARE DEALING RIGHT NOW WITH

89
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,010
ONE OF THEIR TOP-TIER FEMALE
HOUSE, SHE LEFT BECAUSE SHE

90
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,100
FOUND OUT ABOUT THE HUGE PAY
DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN HER AND

91
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,470
SOME OF THE MUCH LESS
EXPERIENCED MALE HOSTS.

92
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,400
I KNOW THE TWO HOSTS NOW ON THE
TODAY SHOW GET PAID TOGETHER

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,910
HALF OF WHAT MATT LAUER WAS
GETTING PAID.

94
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:15,080
MARK WAHLBERG WAS THE BEST PAID
ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD LAST YEAR.

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,540
HE HAS BEEN NOMINATED BEFORE,
FOR THE

96
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:27,910
DEPARTED AND SHE HAS BEEN
NOMINATED BEFORE.

97
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:34,700
>>
BUT THAT IS NOT BOX OFFICE DRAW.

98
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:46,990
BUT YOU 
KNOW THERE IS SOME

99
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,100
ISSUE, YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM

100
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,100
THAT, IT IS A FACT.

101
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:58,000
BUT IN TERMS OF ONE PARTICULAR
CASE AT A TIME, I DON'T THINK

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,310
YOU CAN MAKE ASSUMPTIONS.

103
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:07,460
MATT LAUER CAME FROM A TIME WHEN
TV HAD ENDLESS MONEY AND THEY

104
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,680
THOUGHT THE STARS WHO SMILED A

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,220
LITTLE BIT BETTER ON CAMERA
SHOULD GET $25 MILLION AT A TIME.

106
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,690
THOSE DAYS ARE LARGELY GONE.

107
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,220
I THINK MEGYN KELLY GOT THE
LAST BIG CONTRACT.

108
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,990
AND BY THE WAY FROM NBC, THE
TODAY SHOW, AND SHE IS A WOMAN.

109
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,360
SHE NOW PROBABLY GETS PAID MORE
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE

110
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,530
BUILDING.

111
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,300
HODA - WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

112
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,490
>>I NEVER WATCH THAT SHOW.

113
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,250
>>SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME
DRAWL?

114
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,190
RIGHT OR WRONG?

115
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,680
THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE PAID THE
SAME AS MATT LAUER, THAT IS

116
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,750
NOT HOW IT WORKS.

117
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:00,140
PEOPLE THAT JUST CAME OUT OF LAW
SCHOOL OR MEDICAL SCHOOL 単 THERE

118
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,980
IS NO REASON WHY A MAN OR WOMAN
SHOULD BE PAID DIFFERENTLY.

119
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,130
IF YOU SAW THAT IT IS CLEAR
DISCRIMINATION.

120
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,430
IF YOU GO TO A DOCTOR AND YOU GO
TO THE SAME HOSPITAL IN THE

121
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,331
SAME MARKET, CLEAR
DISCRIMINATION IF YOU ARE

122
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,840
GETTING PAID DIFFERENTLY.

123
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,020
THERE ARE 1000
DIFFERENT FACTORS.

124
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,140
LOOK AT THE OVERALL TREND, THAT
MATTERS AND THE TREND DOES

125
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,570
SHOW DISCRIMINATION.

126
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,960
BUT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS
THERE ARE TOO MANY FACTORS TO

127
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:44,350
BE ABLE 

128
00:08:44,350 --> 00:00:00,000
TO TELL.
