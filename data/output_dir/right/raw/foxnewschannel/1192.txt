1
00:00:00,713 --> 00:00:01,614
DOW GAINED 178.

2
00:00:01,614 --> 00:00:03,983
S&P 500 FINISHED AHEAD 12.

3
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,151
NASDAQ JUMPED 52, FINISHING AT A

4
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:08,588
RECORD HIGH.

5
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:10,390
CANADA'S THREAT TO RECIPROCATE A

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,124
NEW YEAR'S IMPORT TARIFFS COULD

7
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:13,393
EVEN EXTEND TO SOMETHING AS

8
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:15,228
BENIGN AS MAPLE SYRUP.

9
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:16,929
IT'S THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF

10
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,630
ENTRENCHMENT BETWEEN THE U.S.

11
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,932
AND SOME OF ITS TOP TRADING

12
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:20,300
PARTNERS.

13
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,601
CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CORKE HAS

14
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,168
MORE TONIGHT FROM THE

15
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,037
WHITE HOUSE.

16
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:25,738
>> THESE TARIFFS, THEY ARE

17
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:26,806
PURELY DEFENSIVE IN NATURE.

18
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:28,541
THEY ARE DESIGNED BASICALLY TO

19
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,742
BRING THESE INDUSTRIES BACK TO

20
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:31,044
LIFE AND GUESS WHAT.

21
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:34,013
FROM DAY ONE, THOSE TARIFFS WERE

22
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,214
ANNOUNCED, THEY ARE WORKING.

23
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:38,184
>> WORKING, SAY OFFICIALS, TO

24
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:38,885
RESTORE COMMERCE AND ENHANCE

25
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:47,627
U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY.

26
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:48,361
THE PRESIDENT'S TWITTER FEED HAS

27
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,062
ASSAILED THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE

28
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:49,796
TARIFFS, ADDING DEFIANTLY BY THE

29
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,463
TIME I FINISHED TRADE TALKS,

30
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:51,097
THAT WILL CHANGE.

31
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:51,964
MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT IS LONGER.

32
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:54,600
THE UNITED STATES HAS THE

33
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,401
LARGEST TRADE DEFICIT.

34
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:57,403
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY SINCE 1975.

35
00:00:57,403 --> 00:01:02,475
WITHIN AN $811.02 GAP IN 2017

36
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:02,775
ALONE.

37
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:06,212
NEARLY HALF OF THAT, THREE AND

38
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:07,613
ARE 25 BILLION THANKS TO CHINA.

39
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:09,582
FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM TO

40
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:11,584
BEIJING, FROM OTTAWA TO

41
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:13,319
MEXICO CITY, THE TALK ON TARIFFS

42
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,420
AND SPARKING FEARS THAT THE

43
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,823
GLOBAL TRADE WAR IS IMMINENT.

44
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:18,124
TODAY BRITISH PER MR. THERESA

45
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:19,459
MAY TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A

46
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:22,061
PHONE CALL THAT U.S. TARIFFS ON

47
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,029
E.U. STEEL WERE UNJUSTIFIED AND

48
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,833
DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING.

49
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,800
MEXICO FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST

50
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,802
THE U.S. WITH THE WTO.

51
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:30,837
CHINA WARNED THAT INCREASED

52
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:31,704
TARIFFS WOULD FORCE HER TO

53
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:36,008
RENEGE ON A PROMISE TO REDUCE

54
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,810
ITS TRADE SURPLUS.

55
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,511
CANADIAN OFFICIALS STONED BY

56
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:43,449
FEES ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM HAVE

57
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:44,150
PROPOSED $16 BILLION IN WHICH

58
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,786
ALLEGORY TARIFFS.

59
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:49,756
>> THE IDEA THAT WE ARE NATIONAL

60
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:51,758
SECURITY THREAT TO THE

61
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,259
UNITED STATES IS FRANKLY

62
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,795
INSULTING AND UNACCEPTABLE.

63
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:56,529
SOME EXPERTS THINK THE STRATEGY

64
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:57,697
IS WELL-INTENTIONED GOES TOO FAR

65
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:58,231
IS WELL-INTENTIONED GOES TOO FA.

66
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,432
>> IN SOME RESPECTS THE

67
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:00,933
PRESIDENT'S RIGHT BUT THE

68
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:01,534
ANSWERS NOT NOT TO THROW

69
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,736
BARRIERS ON OUR SIDE.

70
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:07,407
IT STILL WORKED TO EXPAND ACCESS

71
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,008
ABROAD AND LOWER TARIFFS ACROSS

72
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:09,709
THE GLOBE.

73
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,009
>> HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN HAS

74
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,613
MADE NO SECRET OF ITS OPPOSITION

75
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:14,947
TO THE TARIFFS WHILE HOUSE

76
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:15,681
MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY

77
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,316
SAYS THE PRESIDENT IS MERELY

78
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:19,152
STANDING UP FOR FREE AND FAIR

79
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:19,452
TRADE.

80
00:02:19,452 --> 00:00:00,000
A CONTENTIOUS DEBATE LIKELY TO
