>>YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP DID
WHAT HE DOES, HE DENIGRATED
ENTIRE COUNTRIES AND COMMUNITIES
BY WONDERING ALOUD DURING AN
OFFICIAL MEETING, WHERE THERE
WERE PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM WERE
HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND
LIKELY TO SQUEAL, WHY WE SHOULD
TAKE IMMIGRANTS FROM, QUOTE,
SHITHOLE COUNTRIES IN AFRICA AND
THE CARIBBEAN.
MULTIPLE TIMES,
HE SAID THAT.
AGAIN, THIS WAS
NOT WELL HE WAS SITTING IN BED
WITH A CHEESEBURGER WATCHING FOX
NEWS, HE WAS WITH REPUBLICAN AND
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND THEIR
STAFF, SO THAT CAME OUT.
HE IS GOING TO DENY HE SAID
THAT, HE TWEETED THIS THIS
MORNING --
>>BECAUSE WHAT HE CARES ABOUT
IS THE DREAMERS, HE WANTS TO
HELP THE DREAMERS.
HE WENT ON TO
SAY --
>>IT USUALLY WORKS OUT WELL
WHEN PRESIDENTS START RECORDING
ALL THEIR MEETINGS,
HISTORICALLY.
SO HE'S DENYING
IT, LET'S TURN TO ONE OF THE
INDIVIDUALS WHO WAS AT THE
MEETING, SENATOR DICK DURBIN.
>>AS SENATOR GRAHAM MADE HIS
PRESENTATION, THE PRESIDENT
INTERRUPTED HIM SEVERAL TIMES
WITH QUESTIONS AND IN THE COURSE
OF HIS COMMENTS SAID THINGS
WHICH WERE HATE FILLED, VILE,
AND RACIST.
I USE THOSE WORDS
ADVISEDLY, I UNDERSTAND HOW
POWERFUL THEY ARE, BUT I CANNOT
BELIEVE IN THE HISTORY OF THE
WHITE HOUSE AND THAT OVAL OFFICE
AND HE PRESIDENT HAS EVER SPOKEN
THE WORDS THAT I PERSONALLY
HEARD OUR PRESIDENT SPEAK
YESTERDAY.
YOU'VE SEEN THE
COMMENTS IN THE PRESS, I HAVE
NOT READ ONE OF THEM THAT'S
INACCURATE.
>>I DISAGREE IN PART.
MAYBE
THEY'VE NEVER LITERALLY
SAID SHITHOLE COUNTRIES BUT I'M
SURE PRESIDENTS HAVE SAID
SOME AWFUL STUFF.
>>HAVE YOU HEARD THOSE
RECORDINGS OF NIXON OR LBJ?
LBJ
WAS TALKING TO HIS TAILOR ABOUT
HIS BUNGHOLE.
>>HE MIGHT HOT HAVE SAID
SHITHOLE BUT HE SAID BUNGHOLE.
>>TO NO SURPRISE THE PRESIDENT
STARTED TWEETING THIS MORNING,
DENYING HE USED THOSE WORDS.
IT
IS NOT TRUE, HE SAID THESE HATE
FILLED THINGS AND HE SAID THEM
REPEATEDLY.
WHEN A QUESTION WAS
RAISED ABOUT HAITIANS, FOR
EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A GROUP THAT
HAVE TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS
IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE
THEY WERE THE VICTIMS OF CRISES
AND DISASTERS AND POLITICAL
OF PEOPLE, THE LARGEST GROUP IS
EL SALVADOR, THE SECOND IS
HONDURAS, THE THIRD IS HAITIAN,
AND WHEN I MENTIONED THAT HE
SAID HAITIANS, DO WE NEED MORE
HAITIANS?
>>AND SUGGESTED PERHAPS, FULLY
AT RANDOM, THAT INSTEAD WE COULD
PERHAPS HAVE MORE PEOPLE FROM
NORWAY.
JUST COINCIDENTALLY IT
WAS NORWAY, WHICH I SPENT SIX
WEEKS IN THIS YEAR, AND IT WAS A
LOVELY COUNTRY FOR VERY INVITING
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT I WOULD
LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY TO MOVE
CLOSER TO.
BUT THEY ARE ALSO
NOTABLY QUITE WHITE.
ALTHOUGH
NOT UNIVERSALLY, MUCH MORE SO
THAN HAITI PERHAPS.
THAT COULD HAVE TIED INTO WHY HE
SUGGESTED NORWAY.
>>I WAS GOOD TO ASK, WAS
EVERYONE YOU MET ITCHING TO COME
HERE?
HOW CAN WE GET TO
THE UNITED STATES?
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND DIDN'T
HAVE TO PAY, AND I FEEL
LIKE THIS ISN'T FREEDOM AT ALL.
>>IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A
FREELOADER WHEN I WALKED OUT
WITHOUT GOING BANKRUPT, I WANT
TO FEEL LIKE I'M INVESTED IN THE
SYSTEM.
NO, AND IN FACT
APPARENTLY LAST YEAR ONLY 500
NORWEGIANS CAME TO AMERICA TO
LIVE HERE.
>>IF TRUMP IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
DEMENTIA, ALCHEMY ALWAYS
REMEMBERS TO BE RACIST EVERY
DAY?
>>CHECKMATE.
>>THEY SAY THAT'S THE LAST
THING TO GO.
>>ONE THING THAT MIGHT PLAY
INCOME EVERYONE HE SAYS HE
REPEATS THE SAME THING OVER AND
OVER A LOT, INCREASINGLY IN
SMALL PERIODS OF TIME.
WHICH
MIGHT MEAN THAT HIM REPEATEDLY
SAYING THEY ARE SHITHOLE
COUNTRIES IS IT TECHNICALLY AS
BAD AS IF WE REPEATEDLY SAY IT,
BECAUSE I HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT
TO SAY THE SAME THING OVER AND
OVER, BUT IF HE IS JUST ADDLED
THEN MAYBE HE'S JUST A
RUN-OF-THE-MILL RACIST AND NOT
AN ESPECIALLY TERRIBLE RACIST.
MAYBE.
>>I'LL JUST SAY THIS, THAT I
REALLY AM SHOCKED TO FIND OUT
HE'S REALLY A RACIST.
HE'S BEEN
A RACIST SINCE THE MOMENT HE
OPENED HIS MOUTH, HE CHASED
BARACK OBAMA AROUND FOR FOUR
YEARS ASKING FOR HIS BIRTH
CERTIFICATE, MEXICANS ARE
RACIST, MUSLIMS CHEERED 9/11 --
>>THE CENTRAL PART FIVE,
HOUSING PRACTICES, IT'S NOT
LIKE THERE WEREN'T CLUES.
>>THERE ARE GOOD NAZIS.
HOW CAN
YOU SAY THERE ARE GOOD NAZIS?
>>I AGREE, I THINK THE REASON
THIS ONE STANDS OUT A LITTLE BIT
IS NOT FOR SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE
SAID BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHO FIGHT AS
HARD AS POSSIBLE TO NOT STATE
THE OBVIOUS ARE STARTING TO
STATE THE OBVIOUS A LITTLE BIT.
ANDERSON COOPER AND DON LEMON
WERE GOING ON SAYING WE HAVE TO
BE HONEST, THESE ARE RACIST
COMMENTS.
WHEREAS A LOT OF THE
STUFF YOU'VE LISTED THERE,
PEOPLE BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO
TRY TO EXCUSE OR SAY OH WELL, WE
DISAGREE AND EVERYTHING, BUT
THERE ARE HONORABLE POLITICIANS
ON BOTH SIDES AND EVERYTHING.
SO
IF THIS STANDS OUT THEN GOOD, IT
SHOULD, BECAUSE THIS IS
PARTICULAR RACISM, SOME OF THE
OTHER EXAMPLES YOU GAVE ARE GOOD
FOR THIS TOO, BUT THIS ISN'T
JUST A BAD COMMENT, THIS
DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE POLITICAL
DISCUSSION THEY ARE HAVING IN
THEIR MEETINGS RIGHT NOW.
WHAT
SORTS OF GROUPS WILL GET LEGAL
PROTECTIONS, WHICH GROUPS WILL
BE PRIORITIZED OR NOT WHEN IT
COMES TO IMMIGRATION POLICY?
THIS AFFECTS POTENTIALLY WHEN HE
GOES ABROAD THE DIPLOMACY WE
HAVE, DEALS WE MAKE WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES.
IF HE THINKS ENTIRE
REGIONS OF THE WORLD ARE
"SHITHOLES," THEN WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN WE TRY TO LIST THOSE
COUNTRIES IN CLIMATE RELATED
DEALS, SECURITY DEALS, THINGS
LIKE THAT?
ECONOMIC DEALS, TRADE
DEALS?
>>THIS WILL ULTIMATELY HELP
TRUMP WITH HIS BASE.
>>I AGREE.
>>AND PROBABLY HALF THE COUNTRY.
>>I'VE SAID 37%, I HOPE IT'S
NOT HALF.
YOU THINK IT'S HALF?
>>THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
ARE RACIST WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR
TRUMP, I BET.
OR SOME.
>>THAT'S POSSIBLE.
>>THIS WILL ONLY HELP HIM.
IT
KIND OF MAKES ME GIGGLE WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT HE CALLED IT A
SHITHOLE, WHY ARE PEOPLE FROM
SHITHOLE COUNTRIES COMING HERE?
IT MAKES ME LAUGH BECAUSE HE
TALKS LIKE ALL THE GUYS I USED
TO WORK WITH, GROW UP WITH,
THAT'S HOW THOSE GUYS TALK.
ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW
THERE ARE THOSE GUYS GOING,
YEAH, HE TOLD THE TRUTH, PEOPLE
ARE GETTING ON HIM NOW.
>>IT'S POSSIBLE.
>>COME ON, HAITI IS A
SHITHOLE.
YOU WANT TO GO LIVE
THERE?
IT MAKES TRUMP LOOK LIKE A TRUTH
TELLER WHO IS GETTING SHIT
ON BY THE LIBERAL ELITE.
>>EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE LABELING
THESE COUNTRIES SHITHOLES
BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS FANCY AS
HIS GOLDEN THRONES IS A PRETTY
DAMN ELITIST THING TO SAY IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
>>IF YOU WERE DRUNK AND THROWING
UP IN TRUMP'S PENTHOUSE
APARTMENT, YOU WOULDN'T THROW UP
IN A GOLD TOILET AND THINK, AM I
IN TRUMP'S HOUSE OR THE VATICAN?
>>EITHER WAY IS A GOOD PLACE TO
PUKE BUT WHERE AM I?
