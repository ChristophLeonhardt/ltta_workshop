1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,789
A UNIVERSITY IN FLORIDA
HAS A CLASS THAT UNFORTUNATELY

2
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:07,260
NEEDS TO BE GUARDED BY POLICE
BECAUSE OF THE TOPIC THAT IS

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,990
COVERED IN THAT CLASS.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,720
IT IS TITLED WHITE RACISM AND IT
IS AT FLORIDA GULF UNIVERSITY.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,250
THE FIRST CLASS HAD TWO
POLICE GUARDS GUARDING IT

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,080
BECAUSE OF THREATS THAT WERE
MADE TOWARD TED THORNHILL WHICH

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,010
IS THE PROFESSOR TEACHING THE
SOCIOLOGY COURSE.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:41,390
SOME OF THE 

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,030
THREATS THAT THE
PROFESSOR RECEIVED INCLUDED THE

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,640
STANDARD DEATH THREATS WHICH
MOST PUBLIC FIGURES EXPERIENCE

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:01:04,839
AT SOME POINT, BUT ALSO SOME
COMMENTS INCLUDING 

12
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,839
THE

13
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:11,119
FOLLOWING:

14
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:21,499
NO IRONY THERE AT ALL, GIVE HIM
A RACIST NAME AND THEN CALL

15
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:22,619
HIM RACIST.

16
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,549
THAT WENT RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD.

17
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,979
THIS NEXT ONE APPEARS TO BE SENT
BY DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE OF

18
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:42,649
THE USE OF CAPS BUT PROBABLY
NOT.

19
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,649
IT SAYS:

20
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,020
OF COURSE THEY CALLED A SUBHUMAN
MONGREL WHILE SAYING HOW DARE

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,399
YOU SAY THERE IS WHITE RACISM.

22
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,039
EVERY ONE OF THOSE MISSED THE
CONCEPT OF IRONY.

23
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,999
NOW LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.

24
00:01:55,999 --> 00:02:02,060
HAS THERE BEEN WHITE DOMINANCE
SUPREMACY AND RACISM IN

25
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,030
THIS COUNTRY FOR HUNDREDS OF
YEARS?

26
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,929
NO, NEVER.

27
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,500
IS THIS A DEBATE?

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,290
LOOK, WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF RACISM IN THIS

29
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,150
COUNTRY, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT
HE IS CALLING YOU RACIST.

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,689
HE DOES NOT KNOW YOU.

31
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,569
YOU TAKE IT SO PERSONALLY AND IT
MAKES ME WONDER WHAT IT IS

32
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,659
THAT MAKES YOU DO THAT.

33
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,579
ANA IS LITERALLY CAUCASIAN, DO
YOU TAKE IT PERSONALLY?

34
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,579
I DON'T.

35
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:33,400
NOT ONLY DO I LOOK WHITE,
ARMENIANS ARE FROM THE CAUCUS.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,269
FOR ME, THIS CLASS IS NO
DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER

37
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,780
SOCIOLOGY CLASS HAS BEEN TAUGHT
IN REGARD TO RACE RELATIONS

38
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,180
IN THE UNITED STATES.

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,160
THE THING THAT TRIGGERED PEOPLE
WAS THE TITLE OF THE CLASS,

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
WHITE RACISM.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,439
IF YOU GET TRIGGERED BY THAT,
THEN THERE IS SOME SORT OF

42
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,900
GUILT EITHER SUBCONSCIOUSLY OR
VERY CONSCIOUSLY BEGINNING

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,769
TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR
ABOUT THIS CLASS, I DO NOT

44
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,459
THINK OH MY GOD, THIS GUYS
CALLING YOU RACIST, HOW DARE HE.

45
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,209
I DO GO, WE ARE GOING TO GO
THROUGH HAPPENED

46
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,189
HISTORICALLY IN THE UNITED
STATES AND WHAT IS

47
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,910
CURRENTLY HAPPENING TODAY WHICH
MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO I WOULD

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:17,450
SAY ISN'T SO OVERT BUT LATELY IT
HAS BEEN.

49
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,700
LET'S CONTINUE.

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
WHITE RACISM.

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,560
DOES THAT MEAN IF YOU ARE
TEACHING A CLASS ON WHITE

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,500
RACISM THAT THAT IS THE ONLY
RACISM THAT EXISTS AND THAT

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,830
IS WHAT THE PROFESSOR THINKS?

54
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,530
NO, HE NEVER SAID THAT.

55
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,959
COULD
THERE BE BLACK RACISM, ASIAN

56
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,959
RACISM?

57
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,959
OF COURSE.

58
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,889
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD RACISM IS?

59
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:40,090
ALMOST EVERYBODY THINKS THAT
EVERYONE ELSE IS LESS THAN THEM.

60
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,389
IN JAMAICA, YOU COULD HAVE A
CLASS ON BLACK RACISM AGAINST

61
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,489
ASIANS.

62
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,920
WHEN I WAS THERE ABOUT A DECADE
AGO, AND I DO NOT KNOW IF IT HAS

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,579
CHANGED SINCE THEN, BUT
MOST EVERY ASIAN PERSON AND

64
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,560
THERE WERE PLENTY AND JAMAICA
ARE CALLED MR.

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
CHEN AND MISS

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,999
CHEN AND I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE
ASIAN AND JAMAICAN AND THEY

67
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:03,049
DO NOT APPRECIATE IT.

68
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,859
IF YOU ARE DOING THE CLASS IN
JAMAICA, YOU WOULD DO ONE

69
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,930
ON BLACK RACISM, AND CHINA, YOU
MIGHT DO IT ON CHINESE RACISM.

70
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,950
BUT IN AMERICA, WHAT IS THE
PRIMARY FORM OF RACISM?

71
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,909
CORSET IS WHITE RACISM.

72
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:20,209
I TALKED ABOUT IN A RECENT
OLD-SCHOOL, MEMBERS ALWAYS GET

73
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,120
IT, TYTNETWORK.COM/JOIN BUT IT
IS NOW IN ITUNES THAT WE JUST

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,810
DID IT WITH JAYAR AND MALCOLM IN
THE LAST EPISODE BUT REAL QUICK

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,220
HERE, TURKS IN GERMANY ARE THE
MINORITY AND THEY ARE

76
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,470
TREATED LIKE AFRICAN-AMERICANS
ARE TREATED HERE IN AMERICA

77
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,370
SO IF YOU DID A CLASS ON GERMAN
RACISM AGAINST TURKS IN

78
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,710
GERMANY THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE.

79
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,190
TURKESTAN RACISM AGAINST GERMAN
I'M SURE EXISTS BUT IT IS

80
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,930
NOT THEIR PREDOMINANT ISSUE IN
GERMANY.

81
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,540
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU ARE IN
TURKEY WHERE THE TURKS OF THE

82
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,281
MAJORITY THEN A CLASS ON TURKISH
RACISM MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN

83
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:56,900
THE WORLD WHEREAS CLASS ON A
MARTY AND RACISM AGAINST

84
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,710
TURKS IN TURKEY MAKES NO SENSE
BECAUSE TURKS ARE THE

85
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,819
MAJORITY IN TURKEY.

86
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,710
THESE ARE SIMPLE CONCEPTS
BUT YOU DON'T CARE TO

87
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,580
UNDERSTAND THEM IF YOU THINK
KNOW, THERE'S NO SUCH THING

88
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,099
AS RACISM, WHY WON'T BLACK
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEIR ROLE AS?

89
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,520
FOR ME, THIS GOES BEYOND THE
SPECIFIC TOPIC OF RACISM.

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,620
THIS GOES TOWARD A BROADER
TOPIC THAT'S BEEN ONGOING

91
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,560
REGARDING COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND
FREE SPEECH.

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,699
FOR ME IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALLOW
VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES TO BE

93
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,990
REPRESENTED ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS
EVEN IF IT IS A PERSPECTIVE THAT

94
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,849
YOU DISAGREE WITH BECAUSE YOU
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN AN

95
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:41,389
ENVIRONMENT THAT CHALLENGES YOUR
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS AND SO WHEN

96
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,349
YOU HAVE THE BEEN SCHAPIRO'S GO
ON TO THE BERKELEY CAMPUS TO

97
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,789
GIVE A SPEECH, I DON'T LIKE THE
PEOPLE TRY TO STOP THAT

98
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,830
SPEECH FROM HAPPENING, EVEN IF
YOU DISLIKE HIM OR DISAGREE

99
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,699
WITH HIS IDEOLOGY, I THINK THAT
THERE IS VALUE IN HEARING

100
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,879
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

101
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,810
I LISTEN TO HIS PODCAST TIME TO
TIME, NOT BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF

102
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,400
HIS, BECAUSE WHO KNOWS, MAYBE
THERE'S SOMETHING HE IS RIGHT

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,650
ABOUT THAT I AM RIGHT ABOUT.

104
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,240
YOU ARE OPEN-MINDED THAT

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,219
HERE'S THE THING, I THINK
THAT WE AS HUMANS, IT'S A

106
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,050
HUMAN INSTINCT THAT WE ALL
KIND OF REVERT BACK TO HER

107
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,669
COMFORT ZONE AND WE REMAIN IN
OUR LITTLE IDEOLOGICAL

108
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,700
BUBBLES AND I WANT TO BE
CHALLENGED.

109
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,120
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WOULD
HEAR AN ARGUMENT ON THE

110
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,419
OTHER SIDE THAT I THINK IS
VALUABLE AND IT WILL MAKE

111
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,090
ME DO A LITTLE MORE
INVESTIGATING.

112
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,330
THAT IS A GOOD THING.

113
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,080
I WANT COLLEGE STUDENTS TO STOP
TRYING TO BE CAUGHT OLD.

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,409
I KNOW THAT IS GOING TO OFFEND A
LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT ONCE YOU

115
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,670
ARE OUT OF COLLEGE AND YOU ARE
IN THE REAL WORLD, IT GETS REAL.

116
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,919
THERE IS NO ONE TO CALL YOU OR
TO CARESS YOUR BEHIND AND

117
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,810
TELL YOU IT IS GOING TO BE OKAY.

118
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,780
LIFE SUCKS AND YOU ARE GOING TO
BE DEALING WITH A LOT OF

119
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,870
PRETTY TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

120
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,259
IT IS BETTER IF YOU WANT TO GET
OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE

121
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:58,319
AND DEAL WITH IDEAS THAT MAKE
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE THEN TO

122
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,289
EXPECT PEOPLE TO JUST AGREE WITH
YOU ALL THE TIME.

123
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,690
TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT, ONE, I
AM A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT

124
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,810
BECAUSE I WAS A REPUBLICAN BUT I
WAS OPEN-MINDED ENOUGH TO START

125
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,860
LISTENING TO THE OTHER SIDE AND
THEN EVENTUALLY I WAS LIKE THAT

126
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,990
POSITION IS TRUE AND BY THE WAY,
HISTORY SHOWED THAT REPUBLICANS

127
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,020
DO NOT BALANCE THE BUDGETS,
THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES

128
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,180
AND PEACE THEIR STRENGTH DIDN'T
MEAN PEACE, ADMIT ENDLESS WAR.

129
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,090
KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND WHAT AND I
SAYING APPLIES TO BOTH SIDES,

130
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,860
LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES ON
COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

131
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,199
KIDDING ASIDE, GOING TO HEAR A
CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER, I

132
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,660
HEARD JESSE JACKSON WHEN I WAS A
REPUBLICAN AT COLLEGE AND I

133
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,470
WALKED OUT GOING, THAT WAS
SURPRISING.

134
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,379
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

135
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,720
HE MADE A BUNCH OF GOOD POINTS.

136
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,601
AND THEN I WENT TO LISTEN TO
FARRAKHAN AND THE FIRST HALF

137
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:49,740
OF THE SPEECH WAS ABOUT PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY AND I LIKED THAT.

138
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,812
THE SECOND HALF WAS ABOUT HOW
THE JEWS OF THE WORST AND I

139
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:52,812
WAS LIKE WHAT?

140
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:56,050
I HATE THAT.

141
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,710
YOU GO AND LISTEN, DOESN'T MEAN
YOU AGREE, IT MEANS TO KEEP AN

142
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,330
OPEN MIND AND FOR CONSERVATIVES,
CAN YOU STOP BEING

143
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,009
SNOWFLAKES FOR A SECOND.

144
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,500
YOU GET TRIGGERED BY, JUST
BECAUSE THEY ADDED THE WORD

145
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,139
RIGHT IN FRONT OF RACISM.

146
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,300
WHAT IS THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF
RACISM IN THE MEXICAN AMERICA?

147
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,169
YOU KNOW THERE WAS SLAVERY AND
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

148
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,310
OF COURSE YOU DO, UNLIKE YOU WE
DON'T CELEBRATE IGNORANCE.

149
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,810
THERE WAS SLAVERY ALL ACROSS THE
WORLD, BUT IN AMERICA, IT

150
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,960
WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE PEOPLE
WHO HAD BLACK SLAVES.

151
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,900
FOR YOU TO DENY THAT IS ABSURD
AND IS DEFENSIVE IN A WAY

152
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,900
THAT MAKES YOU THINK, WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO HIDE?

153
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,880
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD NEED
TO SAVE SPACE FROM THIS

154
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,210
VERY OBVIOUS CLASS.

155
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:49,400
JUST LET IT GO AND HAVE AN OPEN
MIND FOR 

156
00:08:49,400 --> 00:00:00,000
A SECOND, BOTH SIDES.
