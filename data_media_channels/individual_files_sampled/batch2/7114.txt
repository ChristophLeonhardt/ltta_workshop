a father has disowned his son after finding out that he participated in the hate rally in Charlottesville Virginia his name is Pierce theft and he has openly condemned his own son because of his participation in white nationalism he wrote a letter out to the public in regard to how he feels about all of this and he says I have shared my home and hearth with friends and acquaintances of every race gender and Creed I have taught all of my children that all men and women are created equal that we must love each other all the same evidently Peter has chosen to unlearn these lessons much to my and his family's heartbreak and distress we have been silent up until now but now we see that this was a mistake it was the silence of good people that allowed the Nazis to flourish the first time around and it is the silence of good people that is allowing them to flourish now so this is a hell of a thing for dad after to have to write and it is that just like he said it's heartbreaking man and and you wonder you know what did I do wrong how did my son turn out like this and and to disavow someone that's your child it's it's it's really something you never ever ever want to do but if there's a time to do it it's when your son's a Nazi so it takes great courage for him to be able to do that now other people do it in their irrational circumstances so alan keyes well-known conservative just about his daughter because of the way she was born she was a lesbian and so he said oh god made you that way know that I hate you and I never want to see you again and so now in this case pure theft is doing it out of love instead of out of hate and he's saying we taught you that everybody is equal which is a core of America and we taught you to love people not hate people and my guess is they're trying to shake him out of the cult like you know hatred that he's glommed on to and and and these guys some of them online are they they are groupthink and they have their talking points they say the same thing over and over again that they were taught by all trite websites they can't see how ironic half of their statements are and then they'll say things like uh you know I'm for white nationalism but don't call me a racist no by definition that's racist I mean the next thing you know say is I'm a Nazi but don't call me anti-semitic so pierced EFT continues to say that his son Peter is not welcome at our family gatherings any longer he even shared a personal story that I think takes a lot of courage to share he says that his son once joked the thing about us fascist is it's not that we don't believe in freedom of speech you can say whatever you want we'll just throw you in an oven so I again I want to give credit to to Pierce theft here because it takes courage to call that out especially when it's in your own family and and I want you to understand the heavy warning that he's giving us and it rinds me of a story I read about a German industrialist who the Nazis showed gas chambers to and they were bragging to him because he's an industrialist and he's part of the machinery of Germans Germany's industry at the time and he was a person in power and they were showing him how well the gas chamber worked and as he saw the people screaming and it took 20 minutes to die and their fingernails buried in the walls right afterwards he immediately got a train and risked his life to tell the Americans you have to come invade us that what they're doing is horrific so people who believe in that ideology they're not interested in a battle of ideas they're not interested in a debate they're not interested in freedom of speech they believe in violence and violence is what we got at Charlottesville and so here's a kid who was at that rally by is the words of his own dad and then an uncle as well and many people in the family unfortunate I've come forward and said no he's dangerous because they think violence works we can't seize power with our ideas they are deeply unpopular so they think we seize power through violence so it's up to us to make sure us meaning all of America the government just decent people in America to say you're allowed to believe anything you want it's a free country or allowed to say anything you want it's a free country but you're not allowed to take violent action and that's where we draw the line and that's what happened in Charlottesville this weekend so and this is a family saying we're drawing the line you're allowed to believe those things son but you're not allowed to be in our family and and spread that kind of hatred to other people that come to our house TYT membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm / join
