1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
he was my brother yeah it's like an
asteroid fell out of the sky

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:14,610
we have no he hasn't yeah those things
oh yeah now it's last time I talked to

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,720
him was he texted me to ask how my mom
was after we didn't have power for five

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,920
days in the neighborhood you know he
talked to her on the phone a week or two

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,199
ago and didn't send her a walker because
she's having trouble walking

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,100
do you think I mean I thought I was
trying to convey that a little bit well

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,770
that's why we're like I said this is
like an asteroid no there's no I mean

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,170
he had no machine guns when I moved him
from Melbourne to mesquite I mean find

9
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,960
out who gave you know who we bought the
machine guns from and once again

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,550
it's there's no Gleeman you know it's
just he bought the machine guns and he

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:08,840
did this I mean it was him who did this
there's no doubt about it because he was

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,130
him I mean he was lately out of
character

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,860
he's never sure I mean he's never even
drawn his gun

14
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:25,310
oh yeah it makes no sense he's never hit
anybody he's never gonna through this

15
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,860
door just yeah a couple of handguns I
think yeah we had a safe with a couple

16
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,369
handguns he might have had one long
rifle we didn't have any I mean he had

17
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:42,170
no automatic weapons when that I know
that I knew over at any time I there's

18
00:01:42,170 --> 00:00:00,000
no it just
just makes no sense
