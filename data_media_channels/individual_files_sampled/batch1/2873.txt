long as people make decisions and not robots computers you really want to get into the mind of a person of mind of a decision maker and that's the hardest part and that hasn't changed I'm Jack Barsky and I'm going for having spied on the United States as an undercover KGB agent right here in New York City for ten years I understand and I pretty much know that both the Russian intelligence service as well as the CIA have a tendency to overplay the easy part which is electronic espionage there isn't as much emphasis on human intelligence it's hard I mean it kept the Russians five years to train me and first of all you have to find somebody who is a capable of doing this kind of work and be willing to do this kind of work so it's an interesting subject but I think let me repeat this as long as people make decisions the value of human intelligence is what tops it anything else
