WEST VIRGINIA.
LEADING THE COUNTRY IN A LOT OF
WAYS TO STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE
BELIEVE IS WEST VIRGINIANS.
>> Bret: CONGRESSMAN,
THANK YOU.
>> Martha: MR. BLANKENSHIP,
YOU WERE IMPRISONED ON A
CONVICTION IN THE MINE EXPLOSION
CASE, YOU HAVE BLAMED THE OBAMA
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT
ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON COAL,
BUT TOO MANY OF THESE MINING
FAMILIES DID BLAME YOU.
CAN YOU BLAME THEM IF THEY DO
NOT THINK THAT IT IS RIGHT FOR
YOU TO GO FROM THE JAIL CELL TO
THE UNITED STATES SENATE?
>> I DO NOT THINK THAT IS A
QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO BE
ASKING.
TO THE QUESTION WE NEED TO BE
ASKING IS WHETHER WE CAN PREVENT
A BIG BRANCH FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN.
AT THIS TIME AND HAVE THEM
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IT
IN HALF AND FINISHED ALMOST
EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THERE WAS
EXISTENCE FOR 17 YEARS EXPLODED.
BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT
BLAME ME, THEY BLAME THE COAL
MINERS WERE NOT DOING THEIR JOB,
WHICH WAS TERRIBLY UNTRUE.
NEARLY 400 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THEY DID THEIR JOB.
AND I PLEA BARGAIN DURING THE
TRIAL, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
AMAZING THAT THE MINERS DID NOT
DO THEIR JOB, I CANNOT DO THAT.
FACING 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A
FIXED CHARGE, AND I BEAT ALL
THREE OF THE FELONY IS, THEY PUT
ME IN JAIL, BECAUSE I DID NOT
STOP THE COAL MINERS FROM
TELLING EACH OTHER THAT THE
INSPECTORS HAD ARRIVED.
THAT IS NOT A LAW THAT IS ON THE
BOOKS.
THAT IS A LAW THAT THE OBAMA
PROSECUTORS MADE UP IN
REPARATION FOR THE TRIAL.
THE TRIAL WAS VIOLATED OF A
PERSON'S HUMAN RIGHTS TO A FAIR
TRIAL.
TODAY DID THINGS LIKE IN ORDER
TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE THAT
THEY HAD TO GIVE THE DOCUMENTS
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO USE AT
TRIAL, THEY GAVE US 1 MILLION
AND A HALF DOCUMENTS AND SAID
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO USE THE
DOCUMENTS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
THEY SENT ME IMPRISONED FOR A
MISDEMEANOR, I WAS THE ONLY
PRISONER THAT WAS A MISDEMEANOR.
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING
TO THE END THAT IT WAS A FAKE
PROSECUTION.
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO
THOSE THAT SAY THAT YOU HAVE
MADE IT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DEATHS OF THOSE 29
MINERS?
>> I AM ACCEPTING THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN.
THE GOVERNMENT CUTS IT IN HALF.
THE JOB WAS FINISHED EIGHT HOURS
BEFORE THE EXPLOSION.
THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN SAY
ABOUT IT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE
ATMOSPHERE NO MATTER WHETHER YOU
HAVE SHARP BIDS, DOLE BEDS, PLUG
WATER SPRAYS, NO SPRAYS COMING
HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE
ATMOSPHERE.
TO THE WAY YOU PREVENT IT IS A
LOT OF AIRFLOW, AND THESE GUYS
THEY DO THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO
MAKE THAT CHANGE.
THEY SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THEM
AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH.
>> Martha: WHY DID YOU INSIST
THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE THAT
CHANGE?
>> BECAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT
THEY WERE MAKING THE CHANGE.
WHEN YOU HAVE 119 COAL MINES, IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH
WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING.
WE NEED TO BRING IT TO A
REGULATORY INSPECTOR GROUP AND
INVESTIGATIVE GROUP LIKE THE NTS
IN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY WHEN
YOU USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE
MINES TO CONTROL THE ATMOSPHERE.
WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE A RELIEF
VALVE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU
