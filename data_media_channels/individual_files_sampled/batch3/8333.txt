THINGS, CHAD. YOU GET AN "A" FOR THE DAY. HE’S BEEN ALL OVER THIS. EVERYTHING HAS TO GO LIKE CLOCKWORK FOR REPUBLICAN SENATORS HOPING TO MAKE A JUSTICE AND I WILL ALL STARTS ON THURSDAY. "THE FIVE" IS NOW. HELLO, EVERYONE, IT’S FIVE IN NEW YORK CITY AND THIS IS "THE FIVE." PRESIDENT TRUMP UNLEASHING IN HIS FIERCEST SUPPORT YET OF HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I CAN TELL YOU THAT FALSE ACCUSATION AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF ALL TYPES ARE MADE AGAINST A LOT OF PEOPLE. THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY PERSON, AND I CERTAINLY HOPE, I IT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE INSULT TO OUR COUNTRY IF THIS DOESN’T HAPPEN. AND IT WILL BE A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING FOR FUTURE POLITICAL PEOPLE, JUDGES, ANYTHING YOU WANT. IT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE THING. AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING A CON GAME. C-O-N, A CON GAME. AND THEY KNOW IT’S A CON GAME. THE ACCUSER HAS NOTHING, SECOND ACCUSER DOESN’T EVEN KNOW SHE THINKS MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN HIM, MAYBE NOT. SHE ADMITS SHE WAS DRUNK. SHE ADMITS TIME LAPSES. HE’S STARTLED. HE CAN’T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. HIS WIFE IS DEVASTATED. HIS CHILDREN ARE DEVASTATED. I DON’T MEAN THEY ARE LIKE, OH, GO, I’M A LITTLE UNHAPPY. THEY ARE DEVASTATED. MEANWHILE, SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE CONTINUING TO PROVE THAT THE FACTS DON’T MATTER WITH A NEW WAVE OF SUMMERS AGAINST KAVANAUGH. THE SECOND THING ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW IS WHEN HE SAID THAT HE ACTUALLY DOWNPLAYED HIS DRINKING AND HE SAID HE NEVER REALLY BLACKED OUT SO HE DIDN’T REMEMBER THINGS. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT REALLY GO TO CREDIBILITY GIVEN SOME OF THE STORIES CIRCULATING OUT THERE. I’VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES AND I BELIEVE DR. BLASEY FORD, AND I BELIEVE MS. RAMIREZ, BOTH OF THEIR STORIES ARE CREDIBLE, UNLIKE HIS. HE WOULDN’T ACTUALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION OR SAY WHY HE WOULDN’T BE INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I. THAT’S NOT THE RESPONSE OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO PLEAD HIS INNOCENCE. IT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHO IS SEEKING A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT AND HE BEARS THE BURDEN OF DISPROVING THE ALLEGATIONS RATHER THAN DR. FORD AND MS. RAMIREZ, WHO SHOULD BE DISMISSED WITH SLANDEROUS ACCUSATIONS. DANA: GREG, I’M GOING TO START WITH YOU, YOU’RE A GOOD PLACE TO START. THEY ARE THROWING OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT IS THE RIGHT OF CONFRONTATION, THE RIGHT OF CROSS-EXAMINATION, SENATORS. THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND. THEY HAVE HEARD FROM HER, THEY HAVE HEARD FROM HIM SO WHAT’S THE POINT OF HAVING COURTROOMS AND TRIALS IN THIS COUNTRY. SHOULDN’T WE JUST DECIDE IF WE LIKE SOMEONE AHEAD OF TIME? GREG: WHAT’S INTERESTING IS THEY ARE BEING HONEST ABOUT IT NOW. BOTH COONE AND BOTH HAVE FORMULATED A FAIRLY CHILLING RESPONSE WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT DUE PROCESS. THEY GO, THIS ISN’T A COURT OF LAW. YOU DON’T NEED A DUE PROCESS. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY ARE RIGHT. THEY ARE BASICALLY ADMITTING THAT WE CAN CRUCIFY YOU WITHOUT EVIDENCE OR ANY KIND OF CORROBORATION BECAUSE LET’S KEEP IT OUT OF THE COURT OF LAW AND SO YOU LOSE WHAT YOU LEARN NOW IS YOU LOSE YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU’RE UP FOR A JOB, SO MY SOLUTION IS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO GET ACCUSATION INSURANCE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THOUGH IT’S TRUE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS. IT’S CALLED GO FUND ME. GREG: YOU’RE GOING TO NEED ALLEGATION INSURANCE AND THE THING IS, ONE LAST POINT, JUDGE. WE AS HUMAN BEINGS WE MIMIC BEHAVIOR, IF YOU LOOK AT FASHION, DIET, SOCIAL MEDIA, WE COPY EACH OTHER. THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR WILL SPREAD. THE EXCEPTION OF SIMPLY AN ALLEGATION MINUS EVIDENCE IS GOING TO SPREAD INTO OTHER AREAS OF OUR CULTURE. IT’S ALREADY HAPPENING. YOU SEE IT IN THE WORKPLACE AND OTHER PLACES. HOW DO WE STOP IT? JUDGE: KENNEDY, HOW DO WE STOP IT? WHAT WE’VE GOT IS, UNITED STATES SENATORS SAYING THAT HE NEEDS TO DISPROVE A NEGATIVE. HOW DO YOU DISPROVE OR PROVE A NEGATIVE? HE’S GOT TO DISPROVE HE DID THIS. IF HE WASN’T THERE AND HE DIDN’T DO IT, NUMBER ONE, HOW DOES HE PROVE THAT? AND NUMBER TWO, HOW CAN UNITED STATES SENATORS SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IT’S ALWAYS THE COMPLAINANT. IT’S SMART WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY ARE COMING UP WITH A SERIES OF DEMANDS THAT ARE ALMOST UNMEETABLE, AND SO ESSENTIALLY WHEN REPUBLICANS ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAY WE CAN’T MEET THOSE BECAUSE THEY DON’T MEET THE STANDARD FOR, YOU KNOW, PROTOCOL IN THE SENATE, BUT ALSO, I MEAN, THAT’S HOW OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, THAT’S WHAT IT’S BASED UPON, WHICH ESSENTIALLY FOLLOWS FROM NATURAL LAW. SO YOU’RE TURNING ALL OF THAT ON ITS HEAD AND YOU CAN’T DISPROVE A NEGATIVE. JUDGE: COMMON-LAW, ABSOLUTELY. KENNEDY IS RIGHT, JESSE BUT THEY ARE SAYING SHE’S NOT GETTING FAIR AND RESPECTFUL TREATMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY? JESSE: I THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN UNFAIR AND DISRESPECTFUL THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS, TO KAVANAUGH WITH THE SMEARS AND SANDBAGGING. LISTEN, EVERYTHING THEY HAVE DONE HAS BEEN POLITICAL, THE TIMING, THE DEMANDS, THE ENTOURAGE SURROUNDING THIS PERSON. YOU KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS SAID? THEY SAID OKAY. LET’S TAKE POLITICS OUT OF IT. WE AREN’T GOING TO QUESTION HER. WE’RE GOING TO APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR, FEMALE, WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE’S TALKING ABOUT, AND SHE’LL BE THE ONE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS, NOT THE POLITICIANS, AND THEN THE DEMOCRATS TURN AROUND AND SCREAM AND SAID, THIS IS UNFAIR. THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A CIRCUS. THEY HAVE BEEN THE ONES CREATING THE CIRCUS HERE, AND THIS TYPE OF PERSON HAS BEEN USED BEFORE. IN WATERGATE, IN IRAN CONTRA AS WELL AS MAFIA HEARINGS SO THERE IS NOTHING NEW TO THIS. JUDGE: BRINGING IN AN OUTSIDE ATTORNEY. THERE IS NOTHING NEW TO THIS AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE COMPLAINING BECAUSE I DON’T BELIEVE FORD WILL LOOK GOOD BEING QUESTIONED BY A FEMALE EXPERIENCED LITIGATOR WITH THE STORY THAT SHE HAS. I THINK HER STORY WILL NOT HOLD UP WELL, AND THAT’S THE REASON THE DEMOCRATS ARE UPSET ABOUT THIS. I HAVEN’T HEARD A WORD HERE THAT INDICATES BECAUSE THE JUDGE STARTED OUT BY SAYING DEMOCRATS ARE SMEARING JUDGE KAVANAUGH. I HAVEN’T HEARD A WORD OF SMEAR. JUDGE: HE’S GUILTY. HE’S GUILTY. THAT’S A SMEAR. THAT’S NOT A SMEAR. ATTEMPTED RAPIST, THAT’S A SMEAR. LET ME TALK AND THEN YOU CAN RESPOND. CLEARLY THIS IS NOT A COURT. THIS IS A SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING. JUDGE: IT’S CONGRESS. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JUDGE TO TESTIFY, TO SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS. NO ONE HAS HEARD FROM MS. FORD YET. THE SECOND THING TO SAY HERE IS, THEY ARE BRINGING IN A WOMAN LAWYER BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT 11 MEN ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. AND THEY ARE EMBARRASSED. JUDGE: THEY AREN’T EMBARRASSED. THEY CAN WIN BUT WHAT THEY HAVE GOT TO DO IS THEY HAVE GOT TO GIVE HER A FAIR OPPORTUNITY. SO WHAT HER LAWYERS HAVE SAID IS, HEY, WAIT A SECOND. WE’RE NOT COMING IN HERE TO BE BEATEN UP BY SOMEBODY WHO IS A CRIMINAL DEFENSE INVESTIGATOR. YOU REFUSE TO EVEN HAVE THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATE. JUDGE: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. THE RULES ARE VERY SIMPLE. BY AN EXPERIENCED PROSECUTOR. THEY ARE THE SENATORS, WHY SHOULDN’T THEY DO THE QUESTIONING? DANA: BECAUSE THEY BALKED AT IT. THIS GUY WHO IS NOW HIDING OUT, WHO SAYS THAT HE WAS INVOLVED WITH DRINKING ESCAPADES. IF YOU LET ONE WITNESS COME IN THEY WILL HAVE SEVEN, EIGHT, OR NINE, AND THEN YOU’LL DRAW IT OUT UNTIL NOVEMBER. JESSE, YOU SAID A MINUTE AGO WHY ARE THEY ARE RUSHING THIS? THE ONLY REASON WHY IT’S BEING RUSHED IS BECAUSE DIANNE FEINSTEIN DELAYED IT. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WOULD SAY IGNORE THE WOMAN, ESPECIALLY AFTER SHE TAKES THE RISK YOU WANT IT BOTH WAYS. HERE’S THE PROBLEM. THE QUESTIONING OF ANITA HILL WERE SO BAD AND OFFENSIVE AND WE CAN’T HAVE A REPETITION OF THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE. THE CULTURE HAS CHANGED. THE SENATE HAS CHANGED, SOCIETY HAS CHANGED AND WE’RE ALSO IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOVEMENT AND WE DON’T KNOW HOW THAT ENDS. WE DON’T KNOW HOW THAT PERMANENTLY CHANGES SOCIETY, BUT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE LIKE JOE BIDEN AND ALAN SPECTER GOING AFTER A FEMALE WITNESS OR A FEMALE ACCUSER OR SOMEONE WHO HAS SWORN UNDER OATH TO TESTIFY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THEN WHY NOT TRY IT DIFFERENTLY? WHY NOT HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS NOT SHOW BOATING BECAUSE WHEN SENATORS HAVE THEIR CHANCE LIKE CORY BOOKER, THIS IS MY SPARTACUS MOMENT, THAT’S WHEN IT TURNS INTO A CIRCUS AND THAT’S WHEN PEOPLE TUNE OUT. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS AUDITIONING. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A CROSS-EXAMINATION. WHY NOT? JUDGE: HOW ELSE DO WE TEST THE TRUTH IN THIS COUNTRY? BECAUSE YOU GIVE BOTH PEOPLE A CHANCE TO SPEAK. JUDGE: HOW DO YOU DECIDE? WHETHER OR NOT IT’S A CREDIBLE ALLEGATION AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE IT. JUDGE: WHETHER IT’S A CIVIL CASE OR CRIMINAL CASE THIS IS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE UNDER THE RULE OF A SUPREME COURT WITH A MAN ON IT LIKE THIS, AND THAT’S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A TEST OF TRUTH. I’M SAYING YOU JUST WANT A HARD RIGHT SUPREME COURT NO, WHAT I WANT IS THE TEST OF CREDIBILITY. BEFORE WE GO JUDGE: YOU’RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO MISS "THE FIVE" TOMORROW. WE’RE MISSING ONE BIG THING. HE SAID THERE WAS NO SMEAR. WE HAD A GUY WHO JUST CRAWLED UNDER A ROCK AFTER CALLING KAVANAUGH AN ATTEMPTED GANG RAPER AND MADE TWITTER PRIVATE. INSTEAD OF DRIVING DEEP ON A SPECIFIC CASE, WHAT DO YOU IS YOU FIND A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES THAT ALONE ARE NOT STURDY. ONE, FORD, TWO, RAMIREZ, THREE, YEARBOOK, FOUR, AVANETI’S CLAIMS, THE YEARBOOK, THE OTHER CASE HAS NO CORROBORATION, NO WITNESS. INDIVIDUALLY, THEY DON’T MATCH. THEY ARE NOT STRONG. SO WHAT DO YOU IS YOU CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF GUILT BY USING THESE LITTLE THINGS. THAT’S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING WITH THE HELP OF THE MEDIA. JUDGE: IT IS WORKING BECAUSE THE MORE COMPLAINANTS YOU BRING IN, THE FEWER THAT YOU HAVE TO BE TESTIFIED UNDER THE RUFLS OF CREDIBILITY THAT WE’VE USED FROM TIME THEY ARE WILLING TO STAND UP AND PUT THEMSELVES JUDGE: IF THEY DON’T SHOW UP WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU IF THEY DON’T SHOW UP? WHAT IF THEY DON’T? WHAT IF THEY DON’T? I DON’T KNOW. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? JUDGE: YOU KNOW WHY?
