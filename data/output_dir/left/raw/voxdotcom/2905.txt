1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,950
Right now, American protest music sounds like
this.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,410
...we don’t believe you, cuz we the people...
...a million dollar loan...

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,520
...If I don’t say something should I just
lie still...

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,929
But it wasn’t always this way.

5
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,250
While today’s protest music serves the same
purpose as music like this, the way it reaches

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,130
the audience has reshaped the genre time and
time again.

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,730
Early American protest songs like Yankee Doodle
and John Brown’s Body were pretty simple.

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,340
The melodies came from songs people already
knew.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:47,339
The lyrics were repetitive and easy to remember
and that made it easier for the songs to spread

10
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,799
through the oral tradition.

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,379
But the rise of electrical sound recording
in the 1920s changed the way music was created.

12
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,280
It allowed artists to use complex tunes and
lyrics.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,799
A famous example of that is Billie Holiday’s
Strange Fruit from 1939.

14
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:08,840
It was a powerful take on lynchings in the
South.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:18,670
People had a really strong response to the
song — they either loved it or they hated

16
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,670
it.

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,609
It was almost completely banned on the radio,
which meant that most Americans heard about

18
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:25,479
it, if they heard about it at all, through
word of mouth.

19
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:34,100
But its omission from the radio didn’t take
the song out of history.

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,720
After World War two, protest music changed
again when folk music became popular through

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:50,399
the radio.

22
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,360
Woodie Guthrie is probably one of the most
famous folk music protest writers.

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,869
one of his most famous songs is This Land
is Your Land, which he wrote as a protest

24
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:10,679
song in response to this super popular song
the time called god bless America

25
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,420
Guthrie’s music became popular with the
working class and went on to inspire musicians

26
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,420
like Bob Dylan.

27
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,799
The times, they are a changin

28
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:28,110
But Dylan himself edged away from the suggestion
that he was a protest movement leader.

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,140
I got nothing to say about these things I
write.

30
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,349
I just write em.

31
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,780
I don’t have to say anything about them.

32
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,900
I don’t write them for any reason.

33
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,120
There’s no great message.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,947
If you want to tell other people about that,
go ahead and tell em.

35
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:44,260
People turned to Dylan’s music for its unifying
message despite his reluctance to be a part

36
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,700
of any sort of movement.

37
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,590
But there were other artists, who were less
coy than him.

38
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,790
And everybody knows about Mississippi / god
damn

39
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,030
Nina Simone wrote “Mississippi Goddam”
in response to the 1963 murder of civil rights

40
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,459
activist Medgar Evers in Mississippi.

41
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,459
Mississippi goddam

42
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:07,020
In it, she also sings about the bombing of
the 16th street baptist church in Alabama

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
that same year.

44
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,840
Alabama’s got me so upset
The civil rights movement produced several

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
notable pieces of protest music.

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,709
But the late 60s and early 70s also saw a
lot of political unrest in the states.

47
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,969
So this is Marvin Gaye’s 1971 hit What’s
Going On.

48
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:34,510
brother brother brother / there’s far too
many of you dying…

49
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,579
It was a part of the famous wave of protest
music that followed the Kent State massacre

50
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:42,950
when the National Guard opened fire and killed
four unarmed students protesting the Vietnam

51
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
War.

52
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,799
Later as the Vietnam war came to an end, protest
songs in America re-focused on issues of class.

53
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,569
The shift coincided with the rise of VH1 and
MTV in the 1980s which gave artists a visual

54
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,300
medium to express themselves.

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,310
Hip-hop quickly gained notoriety, in part
thanks to groups like Public Enemy and N.W.A.

56
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,090
Fuck the police / and that’s straight from
the underground

57
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,959
While hip-hop became a burgeoning space for
political thought, a feminist punk rock movement

58
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,760
also began to take shape.

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,452
the riot grrrl movement was led by all women
bands like Bikini Kill and Sleater Kinney.

60
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:23,730
and it was in the early to mid nineties when
all these women came together with a focus

61
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,670
on making their music try to forward progressive
agendas, specifically feminist ones

62
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:35,490
All girls should have A real man Should I
buy it?

63
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,350
I don't wanna

64
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:46,280
Our way of life, our very freedom came under
attack in a series of deadly terrorist attacks.

65
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,640
After 9/11 there was this huge pool of emotion
and frustration that helped singers make some

66
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,860
really good music.

67
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:01,190
But the lack of a unifying political movement
left a millennial protest song resurgence

68
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,790
sort of dead in the water.

69
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,890
But bands like Green Day gave a really good
effort and the title track of their 2004 album

70
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,520
American Idiot took aim at the war in Iraq

71
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:19,290
Don't wanna be an American idiot

72
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,650
The election of Barack Obama in 2008 brought
a different energy to protest music.

73
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:31,690
With the first black president in the White
House, musicians took up the empowerment song.

74
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:41,640
Kendrick Lamar’s Alright became a rallying
cry for Black Lives Matter toward the end

75
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
of Obama’s presidency.

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,220
Do you hear me / Do you feel me / we gon be
alright

77
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,010
And in this era social media became the biggest
tool for sharing music.

78
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,430
That change is even more evident in the face
of Donald Trump’s presidency.

79
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:13,900
A good example of that is Milck’s song called
Quiet

80
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,400
The songwriter, Connie Lim, used the internet
to recruit a choir for the song which became

81
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,830
an anthem for the Women’s March.

82
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,970
the purpose of protest music is to bring a
movement together.

83
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:36,340
So as long as people continue to leverage
these new tools that we have with social media

84
00:06:36,340 --> 00:00:00,000
and with the internet to make these songs,
protest music will continue.
