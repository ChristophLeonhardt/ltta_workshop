1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,860
This is Jair Bolsonaro,
the far-right candidate

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,430
that may become
Brazil’s next president.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,560
He’s been compared
to President Trump

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
and Filipino president
Rodrigo Duterte

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,080
for his highly
controversial statements,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,500
including his embrace
of the military dictatorship

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,780
that ruled Brazil for 20 years.

8
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:44,810
Bolsonaro is a retired
military captain

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,730
who has been in Congress
since 1991.

10
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,050
He’s been in the
fringe far right

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,180
for most of his
political career,

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,640
making headlines more for
his outrageous statements

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,970
than for any political
achievements.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,560
In one infamous
episode in 2003,

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,740
he had an argument with
a fellow congresswoman

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,615
who accused him of
promoting violence.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,800
Over the years,
he’s had a long list

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,680
of other divisive remarks.

19
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,130
Last year, as he was toying
with a presidential run,

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,060
he managed to take aim
at several groups

21
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,580
in one statement alone.

22
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,780
Despite the incendiary comments,

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,620
Bolsonaro’s popularity has
grown in recent years.

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,570
He’s vowed to crack
down on crime,

25
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,220
a message that is resonating
with many Brazilians.

26
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,080
Bolsonaro wants to make it
easier to own guns

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,750
and has said he’d give police
permission to kill suspects.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,940
But most of all, he represents
extreme opposition

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,050
to the leftist Workers’ Party,

30
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,680
of former President Lula,
who’s now in jail

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,100
serving a 12-year sentence
on corruption charges.

32
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,060
Bolsonaro’s Workers’ Party
rival in the election is

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,550
Fernando Haddad,
a former mayor of São Paulo

34
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,860
and minister under Lula.

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,980
Bolsonaro uses voters’ distrust
in the Workers’ Party to his favor

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,139
and relies heavily on social media
to spread his message.

37
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,340
In September, he was
stabbed during a rally

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,600
and spent three
weeks in a hospital.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,320
He continued to campaign
through live videos on Facebook.

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,700
But his past statements
continue to spark anger.

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,160
Women across the country

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,010
have rallied against Bolsonaro

43
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,350
using the hashtag #EleNão,
or Not Him.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,700
Despite the critics, Bolsonaro
continued rising in polls.

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,720
In the first round
of the election,

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,850
he won 46% of the vote.

47
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,090
He’s going to a runoff on
Oct. 28 against Haddad,

48
00:03:18,090 --> 00:00:00,000
who now faces
an uphill battle.
