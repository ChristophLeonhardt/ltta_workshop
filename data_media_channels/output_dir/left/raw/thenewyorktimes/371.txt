1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,040
“We're brutally honest
with each other —”

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,520
“Yeah.”

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,849
“— to a point where strangers
might hear us having

4
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:07,371
a conversation and think
that we hate each other.”

5
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:21,400
“I have a lot of good
memories with Oscar.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,750
We worked together for 12 years.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,800
So I think I spent more time
with Oscar than actually my dad.”

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,778
[Laughs]

9
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:47,110
“We inherited Oscar's office,
which is a little bittersweet.

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,870
Not much has changed here
except he had a different desk.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,480
We had to expand to make
room for both of us.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,790
But we were accustomed
to it already.

13
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,260
It didn't feel alien to us.”

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,060
“But it's much messier
than when Oscar was here.

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,120
We have a bucket of
scarves under our desk.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,550
I'm supposed to review them,
but I haven't got there yet.”

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,120
“Professionally speaking,
we grew up in this company.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,920
It was both our first jobs.”

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,960
“It was just very magical for me.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,080
It was a world that I just
didn't realize it even existed —

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,730
the whole uptown,
like the ballgowns.

22
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:33,530
Design-wise, I like things
that are comfortable, stretchy,

23
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,010
slightly more masculine.

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,470
And Fernando likes a
little more corseted —”

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,880
“— well, I just like feminine.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,600
I like to see waists.”

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,860
“So this one was our first custom
V.I.P. dress we made since we came

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,150
back to Oscar.

29
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,730
It's a black velvet bonded with silk.”

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,490
“Women relate to these actresses
and celebrities and hardworking

31
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,910
women much more than a model.

32
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,735
So it brings it to life, I think.”

33
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:03,535
“Yeah.”

34
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,370
“This is our sample room.”

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,760
“Our patternmakers.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,270
Our sewers.”

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,040
“It's like a luxury to
have a sample room.”

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,860
“Yeah.”

39
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,290
“The magic happens in front
of your eyes, whereas,

40
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,950
if you don't have a sample
room, you have to wait,

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,170
and you have to send it out,
and usually it doesn't come back right.

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,060
So it's a real luxury
to have this room.

43
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,740
We didn't know
that till we left.

44
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,483
[Laughs]

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,320
Our first season was
a bit of a struggle.”

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,800
“What happened for two years
when we left the company was,

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,260
our eyes got trained to want
lighter construction and comfort.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,820
We're figuring out how to marry
our vision with what the brand DNA is.”

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,045
“I don't want to make the change
too abrupt because there's

50
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:02,840
an existing customer.”

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,451
“It's very strong clientele.”

52
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,540
“Yeah. So we're trying out little
by little every season.”

53
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,070
“The product that they were
expecting from us would never

54
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,350
feel too alien because it always
had a hint of what Oscar would

55
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,050
have done because at
the end of the day,

56
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,918
we learned everything from him.

57
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:24,700
I, personally, don't feel
intimidated by the legacy of Oscar.

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,890
If I feel intimidated
by something, it's his personality.

59
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,430
It was larger than life.

60
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,070
I think that's more
intimidating than the legacy.

61
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,290
Filling the shoes of the man himself.”

62
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,090
“Yeah.

63
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,940
He used to go to the sample room
and sing for the ladies, too.

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,580
That's something I can't do.”

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:00:00,000
[Laughs]
