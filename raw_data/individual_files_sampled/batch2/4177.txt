do you believe that them continuing to build ICBMs would violate the joint declaration from Singapore yeah what we're going on is the commitment that chairman Kim made to our president and that is the commitment to denuclearize and that is something that we certainly anticipate that he will hold up his end of the bargain and his commitment on that in terms of that specific report I've seen it we're all very well aware of that report that would fall under in an intelligence matter which is something I'm not going to be able to get into really you think he's gonna hold up his end of the bargain hmm that was State Department spokeswoman Heather now are punting on a question about a Washington Post report which NBC News has now confirmed that satellite photos and US intelligence show that North Korea is continuing to produce ballistic missiles and work on their missile program even after the June summit in Singapore between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim jong-eun The Washington Post says work is underway on at least one intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States that news broke just hours after Donald Trump publicly courted the leader of another authoritarian regime Iranian president Hassan rouhani who Donald Trump announced he would meet quote with no preconditions a baffling offer from an American president who last week was hurling Twitter grenades at his Iranian counterpart and an offer that Iran wasted no time turning down thanks but no thanks joining us now is Steve Schmidt Republican strategist and an old friend of mine from our days at the White House and on the campaign trail Steve let's just put this out there you and I worked for someone who could see Russia from her house so we're in a good position to try to ascertain whether or not Donald Trump is operating from sort of ignorance is bliss or whether he seriously has a thing for these dictators what's your take well Nicole let me just say former Republican to begin but at the end of the day Donald Trump made the world profoundly more dangerous with his reality show diplomacy and in in Singapore of course Kim jong-eun is not honoring the spirit of the declaration or the agreement and they're working on an intercontinental ballistic missile which one day a nuclear a miniaturized nuclear warhead will sit on top of that could reach the continental United States and so she's up there spinning the American people the intelligence agencies which were forwarding the information are under constant attack by this administration so roughly for 40% of the country doesn't matter what the Intelligence Agency says what matters is what Trump says now thankfully it's a minority of the country but it doesn't change that in actual reality the country is more endangered because we had an unprepared ignorant president go over there with the same level of rigor that he would plan an apprentice episode with meatloaf and Little John commit Steve how does the intelligence get maybe pull the right thread through all three the intelligence on North Korea didn't didn't ever point to what Donald Trump declared at the end of that summit that they're now no longer a threat the intelligence community didn't point to or support anything that Donald Trump said and this is just what we know of what was public at the press conference in Helsinki and the intelligence on Iran actually suggests that the deal that the president pulled us out of was better than anything he's likely to get on his own so how does the intelligence community serve a client who is so either disdainful or dismissive or just willfully ignores the evidence base and the fact-based intelligence on all three of these dangerous regimes well they can try to serve him and serve him they do but at the end of the day he's the president of the United States and he believes what he believes and there's more than enough news reports to suggest that he doesn't want to hear anything that he doesn't want to hear of course the Iranian deal had verifiable components to it he pulled us out of that he achieved the remarkable feat of putting the United States opposite the European Union Russia and Iran with Iran having the high moral ground with regard to fidelity to the agreement the agreement reached in Singapore with North Korea which he's violating the spirit of was no verification protocols whatsoever so this is all nonsense again it's reality theater but with deadly deadly consequences it was the strategic aim of the North Korean regime one of the most evil and vile in the world a slave regime to elevate its leader to maximum standing on the world stage and they achieved that by standing next to the President of the United States this has been the work of decades and Kim Jong moon knows that his nuclear weapons guarantee him insurance from invasion by the United States and so Donald Trump played all of his cards pushed all the chips and in the middle of the table and he's left with the pair of two's what he proved himself to be was inexperienced naive and ignorant in a fool on the world stage and of course that was noticed by every other adversary of this country's deep really quick I want to ask you if you're surprised that not a single national politically appointed national security official has resigned over what you just described is obvious to everyone in this country and around the world in the American president I'm shocked by it that there are so few men and women of principle that there aren't more Sally Yates's out there that there aren't more people who say enough particularly when we see a President of the United States going behind closed doors with Vladimir Putin agreeing to who knows what saying who knows what making who knows what guarantees to Putin what promises to Putin what promises to turn another eye of Putin acts in the Baltics or anywhere else on the globe he exalts the Canadian Prime Minister he attacks the British Prime Minister he insults and attacks the Chancellor of Germany he questions in an assault and degrades NATO he questions the need for the European Union he is an agent de facto of Russia's foreign policy the foreign policy he's advocating the bipartisan consensus that existed pre Trump between Republicans and Democrats would have recognized as foreign policy is clearly in the middle lane of the Kremlin's strategic Driss and to see it being advanced by an American president is as disturbing as it is shocking Steve your reward for taking off Lattimer Putin's entire honey-do list for Donald Trump is that we're gonna ask you to stick around for one more minute there's a real head-scratcher of a theory being floated about the midterms ninety eight days from now is it possible that Donald Trump actually wants the Republicans to lose that he wants Democrats to take over the house Steve I'm looking at you for the answer that's next hey there I'm Chris Hayes
