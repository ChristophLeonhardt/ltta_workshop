OF SPAIN MARIANO RAJOY, THE 

10
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:18,671
PRESIDENT OF THEIR GOVERNMENT.

11
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,672
JUST MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT 

12
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:22,308
EMPHASIZED THE DISASTER RESPONSE

13
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,976

14
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,410
BEING DESCRIBED AS A 

15
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,679
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER.

16
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,747
ALSO DISCOVERING WITH KOREA, THE

17
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,283
TOUGH SANCTIONS HE SAYS THE 

18
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,685
UNITED NATIONS PASSED LAST WEEK.

19
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:36,221
ALSO THE TIGHTENING OF BANKING 

20
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,324
RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA AND 

21
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:38,524
CHINA.

22
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,492
THE PRESIDENT PRAISED THE 

23
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,660
CHINESE FOR THAT.

24
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,362
OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD

25
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,900
A WAR OF WORDS WITH KIM JONG-UN 

26
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,768
CALLING HIM THE ROCKET MAN.

27
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,104
AND TO MARTHA RADDATZ.

28
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,138
MARTHA, AS THE PRESIDENT HAS 

29
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:56,108
BEEN SPEAKING, THE PRESIDENT AND

30
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,777
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF REMINDING 

31
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,980
EVERYONE HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

32
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,782
>> HE SPECIFICALLY ASKED GENERAL

33
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,553
JOE DUNFORD, IF NORTH KOREA 

34
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,090
POSSESSED A NUCLEAR REACTIVE AND

35
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,991
CAPABLE ICBM SYSTEM.

36
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,961
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID, FOR ALL 

37
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,795
PURPOSES COMPARABILITY AND 

38
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,629
DEVELOPMENT, WE SHOULD ASSUME 

39
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:18,864
NOW THAT NORTH KOREA HAS THE 

40
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,934
CAPABILITY AND HAS THE WILL TO 

41
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,836
USE THAT CAPABILITY.

42
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,204
THAT'S HOW URGENT THIS PROBLEM 

43
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:25,370
IS.

44
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,139
AND IT IS A PROBLEM THAT DONALD 

45
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,307
TRUMP HAS TO DEAL WITH.

46
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,375
NO PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM HAS HAD 

47
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,243
THIS PROBLEM.

48
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,878
IT'S BASICALLY BEEN PUNTED DOWN 

49
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,346
THE ROAD TO DONALD TRUMP.

50
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,114
>> WE'VE SEEN THE ESCALATION 

51
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:38,083
AROUND NORTH KOREA SO FAR, 

52
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:38,751
MARTHA RADDATZ.

53
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,252
AND NORTH KOREA RESPONDING TO 

54
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,887
THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS BY TAKING 

55
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,656
THEM AS A DECLARATION OF WAR?

56
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,791
>> YES, THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER 

57
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,359
SAYS IT'S A DECLARATION OF WAR 

58
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,828
BY HAVING THOSE BOMBERS GO NORTH

59
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,497
OF THE DMZ.

60
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,265
IT WAS OFF THE COAST OF NORTH 

61
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,134
KOREA, ABOUT 100 MILES AWAY FROM

62
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:55,668
NORTH KOREA.

63
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,202
BUT WELL BEYOND THE BORDER WHERE

64
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,804
THEY USUALLY FLY.

65
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,607
HE SAID HE WILL SHOOT THEM DOWN,

66
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,575
EVEN IF THEY ARE, AS THEY WERE, 

67
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,177
IN INTERNATIONAL AIRSPACE.

68
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,745
EXPERTS DO NOT BELIEVE HE HAS 

69
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,213
THAT CAPABILITY RIGHT NOW, 

70
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:08,446
GEORGE.

71
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,615
>> NOT RIGHT NOW.

72
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,116
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO BEEN 

73
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,018
IN SOMEWHAT OF A WAR OF WORDS 

74
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,853
WITH THE NFL TAKING ON THE 

75
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,655
PLAYERS WHO DECIDED TO TAKE A 

76
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,156
KNEE.

77
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,058
IN PROTEST TO HIS COMMENTS ON 

78
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,291
FRIDAY.

79
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,692
THE PRESIDENT COULD GET ASKED 

80
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:21,393
ABOUT THAT AT THE PRESS 

81
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,728
CONFERENCE AS WELL.

82
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,063
AS WE SPEAK ON CAPITOL HILL, IT 

83
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,799
APPEARS THAT THE SENATE HAS MADE

84
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,700
A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO REPEAL 

85
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,303
AND REPLACE OBAMACARE IS FINALLY

86
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,005

87
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,707
THREE SENATORS AGAINST IT.

00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,509
SENATOR RAPIDS PAUL, SENATOR 

89
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,711
JOHN McCAIN, SENATOR SUSAN 

90
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,012
COLLINS OF MAINE.

91
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,215
REPUBLICANS ARE MEETING TO 

92
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:43,815
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE 

93
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,484
ACTUALLY GOING TO PUSH AHEAD FOR

94
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,752
A VOTE ON THIS.

95
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,020
ALL OF THIS COMING AS THE 

96

WANTS TO PASS.

99
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,426
THE PRESIDENT MEETING WITH A 

100
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,794

108
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,373
POLITICAL SITUATIONS OF BOTH OF 

109
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,275
OUR COUNTRIES, SPAIN AND UNITED 

110
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,843

COOPERATIVE VISION.

117
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,756
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE WARM

00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,091
WELCOME THAT WAS EXTENDED TOYS 

119
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,861

00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,895
>> THE PRIME MINISTER OF SPAIN

NOW.

123

MARIANO RAJOY.

124
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,701
>> WITH THE FRIENDSHIP THAT 

125
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:37,936
EXISTS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES

126
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:38,336
AND SPAIN.

127
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:39,471
THANK YOU.

128
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,872

129
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:42,674

130
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:47,046
REUTERS.

131
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:58,390
DON'T GET NERVOUS, STEVE.

132
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,193
BEING PREOCCUPIED WITH THE NFL 

133
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,327
WHY ISN'T THAT FAIR ASSESSMENT?

134
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:05,764
>> WELL, I WASN'T PREOCCUPIED BY

135
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,799
THE NFL.

136
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,167
IT WAS A SHAME.

137
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,102
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DISRESPECT

138
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,404
OUR FLAG, OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.

139
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,005
TO ME, THE NFL IS A VERY 

140
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,574
IMPORTANT SITUATION.

141
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,975
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE ABOUT WAS

142
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,310
I PREOCCUPIED.

143
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,610
NOT AT ALL.

144
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,511
NOT AT ALL.

145
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,313
I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME ON MY 

146
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:21,713
HANDS.

147
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,715
ALL I DO IS WORK.

148
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,784
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THAT'S AN

149
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,020
IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF WORKING.

150
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,688
IT'S CALLED RESPECT FOR OUR 

151
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:29,921
COUNTRY.

152
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,024
MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

153
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,492
MANY, MANY PEOPLE HORRIBLY 

154
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,861
INJURED I WAS AT WALTER REED 

155
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,996
HOSPITAL RECENTLY AND I SAW SO 

156
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,631
MANY GREAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND 

157
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,533
THEY'RE MISSING LEGS AND ARMS 

158
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,901
AND SO BADLY INJURED.

159
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,570
AND THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR OUR 

160
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:44,837
COUNTRY.

161
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,972
THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR OUR FLAG.

162
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,540
THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR OUR 

163
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,908
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

164
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,044
FOR PEOPLE TO DISRESPECT THAT BY

165
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,178
KNEELING DURING THE PLAYING OF 

166
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,513
OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM I THINK IS 

167
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:56,548
DISGRACEFUL.

168
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,383
SO, I WILL ALSO SAY THAT, AGAIN,

169
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,885
I READ YOU PART OF THIS QUOTE, 

170
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,553
BUT THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO 

171
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,555
IS SO THANKFUL FOR THE GREAT JOB

172
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:03,956
WE'RE DOING.

173
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,023
WE DID A GREAT JOB IN TEXAS.

174
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:07,226
A GREAT JOB IN FLORIDA.

175
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,694
A GREAT JOB IN LOUISIANA.

176
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,497
WE HIT LITTLE PIECES OF GEORGIA.

177
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,998
AND ALABAMA.

178
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,767
AND FRANKLY, WE'RE DOING -- AND 

179
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,301
IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT JOB 

180
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,637
BECAUSE IT'S ON THE ISLAND -- 

181
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,971
IT'S ON AN ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE 

182
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,173
OF THE OCEAN.

183
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,508
IT'S OUT IN THE OCEAN.

184
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,009
YOU CAN'T JUST DRIVE YOUR TRUCKS

185
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,611
THERE FROM OTHER STATES.

186
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,478
AND THE GOVERNOR SAID WE ARE 

187
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,980
DOING A GREAT JOB.

188
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,080
IN FACT, HE THANKED ME 

189
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,615
SPECIFICALLY FOR FEMA AND ALL OF

190
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,985
THE FIRST RESPONDERS IN PUERTO 

191
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:33,252
RICO.

192
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,486
AND WE'RE ALSO MENTIONING WITH 

193
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,388
THAT THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.

194
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,123
IT WAS DEVASTATED.

195
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,892
SO, WE ARE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON 

196
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,359
THAT.

197
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,227
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT DOESN'T

198
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,262
TAKE ME LONG TO PUT OUT A WRONG.

199
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:46,498
AND MAYBE WE'LL GET IT RIGHT.

200
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,399
I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT 

201
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,701
THING FOR THE NFL TO NOT ALLOW 

202
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,002
PEOPLE TO KNEEL DURING THE 

203
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,371
PLAYING OF OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.

204
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,472
TO RESPECT OUR COUNTRY AND TO 

205
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:54,906
RESPECT OUR FLAG.

206
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:55,106
OKAY?

207
00:17:55,106 --> 00:18:02,514
THANK YOU.

208
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,682
>> IF I COULD ASK THE PRIME 

209
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,484
MINISTER A QUESTION.

210
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,419
IS IT GOING TO TAKE A WAR TO 

211
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,787
REIN IN NORTH KOREA?

212
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,855
AND WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THE 

213
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:23,135
PRESIDENT ON DEALING WITH THIS?

214
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,404
>> Translator: NO ONE WISHES FOR

215
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,805
THERE TO BE A WAR ANYWHERE IN 

216
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,974
THE WORLD, BUT IT'S TRUE THAT 

217
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,942
THE RECENT EVENTS IN NORTH 

218
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,178
KOREA, WITH IMPLICATIONS IN THE 

219
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,679
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, VERY 

220
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,083
IMPORTANT COUNTRIES AND -- MEANS

221
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,817
THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE FORCEFUL.

222
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,786
AND THOSE OF US WHO DEFEND THE 

223
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,856
VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM AND

224
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:47,125
HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE TO LET NORTH 

225
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,660
KOREA KNOW THAT IT ISN'T GOING 

226
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,062
ANYWHERE IN THAT DIRECTION.

227
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,563
FOR THE TIME BEING, SECTIONS 

228
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,031
HAVE BEEN ADOPTED.

229
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:58,470
SPAIN WILL SUPPORT ANY POLITICAL

230
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,237
DECISION WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE 

231
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:02,341
TO PUTTING AN END TO THIS 

232
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,977
SITUATION, WHICH HAS NOTHING TO 

233
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,778
DO WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND 

234
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,011
VALUES.

235
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,147
MOST OF WESTERN AND GLOBAL 

236
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:12,183
DEMOCRACIES DEFEND.

237
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:22,527
>> ALL RIGHT.

238
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,829
>> THANK YOU.

239
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,830
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER DURING 

240
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,597
YOUR CONVERSATION YOU DISCUSSED 

241
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,332
THE CATALAN SITUATION, AND THIS 

242
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:31,270
IS A QUESTION FOR PRESIDENT 

243
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,703
TRUMP.

244
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,340
DO YOU SUPPORT WHAT THE SPANISH 

245
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,442
GOVERNMENT IS DOING REGARDING 

246
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,010
CATALONIA, I'D LIKE TO ASK THE 

247
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,145
PRESIDENT OF THE SPANISH 

248
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,546
GOVERNMENT WHETHER HE FEARS 

249
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,882
THERE MIGHT BE A UNILATERAL 

250
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,152
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN 

251
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:47,886
CATALONIA, WHAT WILL THE 

252
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,321
GOVERNMENT DO THEN?

253
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,289
>> WELL, I THINK SPAIN IS A 

254
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,825
GREAT COUNTRY AND IT SHOULD 

255
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,493
REMAIN UNITED.

256
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,227
WE'RE DEALING WITH A GREAT, 

257
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,163
GREAT COUNTRY AND IT SHOULD 

258
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:58,897
REMAIN UNITED.

259
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,832
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THAT UNFOLD.

260
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,669
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN UNFOLDING

261
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,603
FOR CENTURIES.

262
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,837
AND I THINK NOBODY KNOWS IF 

263
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,372
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A VOTE.

264
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,440
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY 

265
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,574
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A 

266
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:09,841
VOTE.

267
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,209
BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE WOULD BE 

268
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,878
VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO THAT.

269
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,413
I CAN SAY ONLY SPEAKING FOR 

270
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:14,713
MYSELF.

271
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,547
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SPAIN 

272
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:24,423
CONTINUE TO BE UNITED.

273
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,625
>> Translator: THE DECISION TO 

274
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,092
UNILATERALLY DECLARE 

275
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,927
INDEPENDENCE IS NOT SOMETHING I 

276
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,362
WOULD -- IT'S NOT A DECISION I 

277
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,863
WOULD MAKE.

278
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,431
IT'S A DECISION WHICH WILL HAVE 

279
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,466
TO BE MADE.

280
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,635
OR NOT BY THE CATALAN 

281
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,336
GOVERNMENT.

282
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,704
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG.

283
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,305
AND I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW, WHEN

284
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,240
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE 

285
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,143
REFERENDUM CAN TAKE PLACE 

286
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,679
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T AN ELECTORAL

287
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:47,946
COMMITTEE.

288
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,348
THERE ISN'T A TEAM OF THE 

289
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,382
CATALAN GOVERNMENT ORGANIZING 

290
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,818
THE REFERENDUM.

291
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,086
THERE AREN'T BALLOTS.

292
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,019
THERE AREN'T PEOPLE AT THE 

293
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,123
VOTING STATIONS.

294
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,791
SO, IT'S JUST CRAZY ALL THIS 

295
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,760
WILL LEAD TO IS NOISE.

296
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,995
BUT CERTAINLY, THERE CAN'T BE A 

297
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:07,733
VALID DEMOCRATIC REFERENDUM WITH

298
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,867
GUARANTEES, WITH MINIMUM 

299
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:09,167
GUARANTEES.

300
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,736
I THINK WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IN

301
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,239
A SITUATION, SUCH AS THIS, IS TO

302
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,774
GO BACK TO COMMON SENSE AND PUT 

303
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,609
AN END TO THIS WHOLE STORY.

304
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,245
THE ONLY THING IT'S DOING IS 

305
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,480
GENERATING DIVISION, TENSIONS 

306
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,751
AND IT'S NOT CONTRIBUTING IN ANY

307
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,120
WAY TO THE CITIZEN SITUATION, I 

308
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,155
WANT THIS TO BE RESOLVED AS SOON

309
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:30,822
AS POSSIBLE.

310
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,191
AND I WANT US TO GO INTO A NEW 

311
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,460
STAGE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW, 

312
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,062
DIALOGUE AND COMMON SENSE WILL 

313
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,029
PREVAIL.

314
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:38,296
THANK YOU.

315
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,598
>> I THANK YOU.

316
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,368
MAJOR GARRETT, CBS.

317
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:43,768
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.

318
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:53,044
>> YES, HI.

319
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:56,114
>> -- IN TALKING ABOUT HOURS 

320
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:56,381
AWAY.

321
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,549
ARE YOU TRULY SATISFIED WITH 

322
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,851
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE SO 

323
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,085
FAR?

324
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:07,792
AND CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE AND THE 

325
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,061
OFFICIALS THERE -- 

326
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:12,864
>> ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING THE 

327
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:13,698
DEPLOYMENT OF SPECIAL NAVAL 

328
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:16,234
ASSETS OR AIR ASSETS TO PUERTO 

329
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,837
RICO TO REJECT THE PROBLEMS 

330
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,371
THERE?

331
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,606
AND NORTH KOREA, VERY QUICKLY.

332
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,274
THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID HAD 

333
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,343
YOU HAVE DECLARED EFFECTIVELY A 

334
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,144
WAR ON NORTH KOREA.

335
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,412
AND THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT 

336
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,048
HAS THREATENED TO SHOOT DOWN OR 

337
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,118
AIM AT PLANES FLYING IN 

338
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:33,385
AIRSPACE.

339
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,419
I'D LIKE YOUR REACTION.

340
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,620
>> OKAY.

341
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,124
I'LL ANSWER THE SECOND ONE 

342
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:39,324
FIRST.

343
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,425
WE ARE TOTALLY PREPARED FOR THE 

344
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:40,992
SECOND OPTION.

345
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,227
NOT A PREFERRED OPTION.

346
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,762
IF WE TAKE THAT OPTION IT WILL 

347
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,696
BE DEVASTATING.

348
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,265
I CAN TELL YOU DEVASTATING FOR 

349
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,099
NORTH KOREA.

350
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,502
THAT'S CALLED THE MILITARY 

351
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:50,735
OPTION.

352
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:53,038
IF WE HAVE TO TAKE IT, WE WILL.

353
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,739
HE'S ACTING VERY BADLY.

354
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,307
HE'S SAYING THINGS THAT SHOULD 

355
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:57,876
NEVER, EVER BE SAID.

356
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,878
AND WE'RE REPLYING TO THOSE 

357
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,847
THINGS, BUT IT'S A REPLY.

358
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:08,253
IT'S NOT AN ORIGINAL SLIP, IT'S 

359
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,354
A REPLAY.

360
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,622
IN THE PAST WHAT WILL HE SAID, 

361
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,789
NORTH KOREA IS A SITUATION THAT 

362
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:14,492
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED 25 

363
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,294
YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, 15 

364
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,697
YEARS AGO, 10 YEARS AGO, 5 YEARS

365
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,732
AGO, AND IT COULD HAVE HANDLED 

366
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,900
MUCH MORE EASILY.

367
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,435
YOU HAD VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS,

368
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,337
MANY ADMINISTRATIONS, WHICH LEFT

369
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,404
ME A MESS.

370
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,106
BUT I'LL FIX THE MESS.

371
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,541
SO, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH 

372
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,141
NORTH KOREA.

373
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,643
AS FAR AS PUERTO RICO'S 

374
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,011
CONCERNED, I THINK JUST THE 

375
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,278
OPPOSITE.

376
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,945
WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS REVIEWS 

377
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:36,081
FROM GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AS WE

378
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,648
HAVE IN TEXAS AND LOUISIANA.

379
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,050
AND AS WE HAVE IN FLORIDA, AS 

380
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,887
YOU KNOW, FROM GOVERNOR SCOTT.

381
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,689
AND GREG ABBOTT, GREAT 

382
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,023
GOVERNORS.

383
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,357
AND THIS MORNING, THE GOVERNOR 

384
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:47,926
MADE INCREDIBLE STATEMENTS ABOUT

385
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,061
HOW WELL WE'RE DOING.

386
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,862
WE UNDERSTAND, IT'S A DISASTER.

387
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:53,297
IT'S A DISASTER.

388
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:54,932
THAT JUST HAPPENED.

389
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:57,068
THE GRID WAS IN BAD SHAPE BEFORE

390
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,270
THE STORM.

391
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,238
AND PUERTO RICO DIDN'T GET HIT 

392
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,573
BY ONE HURRICANE.

393
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,608
IT GOT HIT BY TWO HURRICANES.

394
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,209
AND THEY WERE AMONG THE BIGGEST 

395
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:07,078
WE'VE EVER SEEN, WITH THE SECOND

396
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,146
ONE BEING EVEN WORSE.

397
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,214
I MEAN, THE SECOND ONE HIT 

398
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:12,918
PUERTO RICO AS A CATEGORY 5.

399
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,185
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY'S EVER 

400
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:15,420
SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE.

401
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,122
HIT LAND WITH THAT KIND OF 

402
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,424
VELOCITY.

403
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,759
THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN EXTREMELY 

404
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,026
GENEROUS.

405
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:23,295
I APPRECIATED IT.

406
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,565
WE RIGHT NOW HAVE OUR TOP PEOPLE

407
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,666
FROM FEMA.

408
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,600
AND THEY HAVE BEEN THERE.

409
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,468
WE ARE UNLOADING ON AN HOURLY 

410
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,704
BASIS MASSIVE LOADS OF WATER, 

411
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,206
FOOD AND SUPPLIES FOR PUERTO 

412
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:35,941
RICO.

413
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,175
AND THIS ISN'T LIKE FLORIDA 

414
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,944
WHERE WE CAN GO RIGHT UP THE 

415
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:39,144
SPINE.

416
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,945
OR LIKE TEXAS WHERE WE GO RIGHT 

417
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,681
DOWN THE MIDDLE AND WE 

418
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:42,981
DISTRIBUTE.

419
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,384
THIS IS -- THINK ATLANTIC OCEAN.

420
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,153
THIS IS TOUGH STUFF.

421
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,721
THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN SO 

422
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,588
INCREDIBLE IN HIS STATEMENTS 

423
00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:52,057
ABOUT THE JOB WE'RE DOING, WE'RE

424
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,058
DOING A GREAT JOB.

425
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,926
DON'T FORGET, THEIR POLICE FORCE

426
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,328
HAS BEEN DECIMATED.

427
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,162
BECAUSE MANY OF THE POLICE IN 

428
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,931
PUERTO RICO HAVE LOST THEIR 

429
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:00,131
HOMES.

430
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,766
SO, SURE, THEY WANT TO BE 

431
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,134
POLICE, BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO BE

432
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,669
ABLE TO WATCH THEIR FAMILIES AND

433
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,937
FIND THEIR FAMILIES.

434
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,106
AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE.

435
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,340
SO, WE'RE ALSO VERY MUCH 

436
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,910
INVOLVED IN SECURITY IN PUERTO 

437
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,544
RICO.

438
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,178
SO, EVERYBODY HAS SAID IT'S 

439
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:16,347
AMAZING THE JOB WE'VE DONE IN 

440
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:16,881
PUERTO RICO.

441
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,116
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT.

442
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,517
AND I'M GOING THERE ON TUESDAY.

443
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,853
NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING 

444
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,154
SAID, RECORD -- RECORD -- IF YOU

445
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,023
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF WATER 

446
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,424
DROPPED ON THAT ISLAND BETWEEN 

447
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,394
THE TWO HURRICANES, AND THE 

448
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,863
FIRST, THEY JUST BARELY GOT BY 

449
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,699
WITH, BUT THEY WERE DEVASTATED.

450
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,068
AND THE SECOND WAS A COMPLETE 

451
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:37,569
WIPEOUT.

452
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,970
I MEAN, THIS WAS A PLACE THAT 

453
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,505
WAS DESTROYED.

454
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,773
SO, I THINK WE'RE DOING A REALLY

455
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,141
GOOD JOB.

456
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,009
WE'RE CONTINUING TO.

457
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,843
WE'RE LITERALLY UNLOADING ON AN 

458
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:48,113
HOURLY BASIS.

459
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,716
WATER,YSUPPLIES.

460
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,351
WE HAVE OUR TOP PEOPLE FROM 

461
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:53,685
FEMA.

462
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,953
EVERYONE ELSE.

463
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,921
WE'RE DEPLOYED NAVY SHIPS.

464
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,790
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED.

465
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,925
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO FAR MORE 

466
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,060
THAN ANYBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO 

467
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,293
DO.

468
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:04,129
AND IT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED AS 

469
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:04,329
SUCH.

470
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,997
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 

471
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:07,264
PRESIDENT?

472
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:10,769
>> MR. PRIME MINISTER, IF I MAY,

473
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,570
SIR, DO YOU SHARE PRESIDENT 

474
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,739
TRUMP'S HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE 

475
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,507
VENEZUELAN REGIME?

476
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:19,444
AND WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF 

477
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:24,149
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXCEPTION THAT

478
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,552
THE U.S. INTERVENTION MIGHT BE 

479
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,753
REQUIRED WITH VENEZUELA?

480
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,788
AND DO YOU SUPPORT TOUGHER 

481
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:33,558
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE VENEZUELAN

482
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:33,858
GOVERNMENT?

483
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,327
>> Translator: WELL, WE'RE 

484
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,662
SPEARHEADING IN THE EUROPEAN 

485
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,664
UNION A PROPOSAL TO IMPOSE 

486
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,833
SANCTIONS ON VENEZUELA.

487
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,401
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN VENEZUELA 

488
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,969
IS UNACCEPTABLE.

489
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,938
VENEZUELA, TRADITIONALLY, WAS A 

490
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,740
DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.

491
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,675
AND AT THIS TIME, IT'S NO LONGER

492
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,375
A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.

493
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,712
THEY'RE POLITICAL PRISONERS IN 

494
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:53,979
VENEZUELA.

495
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,113
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 

496
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,882
JAIL, ONLY BECAUSE THEY THINK 

497
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,651
DIFFERENTLY THAN MR. MADURO.

498
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:05,957
AND I WAS THE FIRST PRIME 

499
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,228
MINISTER TO -- THE WIFE WHO WAS 

500
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,197
JAILED BECAUSE MR. MADURO DIDN'T

501
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,465
LIKE HIM.

502
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,866
BUT THERE WERE MANY OTHERS SENT 

503
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,234
TO JAIL IN VENEZUELA.

504
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,368
THERE WAS A PARLIAMENT.

505
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:18,970
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE UP 

506
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,571
THIS OTHER PARLIAMENT WHICH HAS 

507
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:24,876
ITS MEETING NEXT TO THE OTHER 

508
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,044
PARLIAMENT.

509
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,044
AND THAT'S LEGISLATION THAT 

510
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,246
CREATED A COMMISSION FOR THE 

511
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,181
TRUTH WHICH IS AN 

512
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,749
ANTI-DEMOCRATIC TOOL WHICH ONLY 

513
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:34,285
SERVES TO JUDGE PEOPLE WITHOUT 

514
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,788
RESPECTING MINIMUM HUMAN RIGHTS 

515
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,055
STANDARDS.

516
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,792
VENEZUELA IS ON THE ROAD TO 

517
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,926
DICTATORSHIP, UNLESS THAT CAN BE

518
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:42,560
STOPPED.

519
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,829
SO, ALL OF US WHO SHARED VALUES 

520
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,430
SUCH AS DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM AND 

521
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:46,930
HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE TO DO 

522
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,900
SOMETHING.

523
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,235
AT THIS TIME.

524
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,669
SANCTIONS ARE IMPORTANT.

525
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,938
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE 

526
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,406
INTERNATIONAL COALITION PUTTING 

527
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:58,042
PRESSURE ON MADURO, SO THAT 

528
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,277
POLITICAL PRISONERS ARE FREED 

529
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,845
AND DEMOCRACY IS RESTORED 

530
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,580
BECAUSE THIS LACK OF DEMOCRACY 

531
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,981
AND THE ATTACK AGAINST HUMAN 

532
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:07,418
RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE COME -- 

533
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:11,022
COME IN CONJUNCTION WITH 

534
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,323
ECONOMIC -- TERRIBLE ECONOMIC 

535
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,258
SITUATION WITH THE 300% 

536
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,861
INFLATION RATE, WITH PROBLEMS 

537
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,263
SUPPLYING FOODS AND MEDICINES TO

538
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:18,730
PEOPLE.

539
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,232
SO, IT'S A REALLY TRAGIC 

540
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,400
SITUATION, AND I THINK WE 

541
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,068
HAVE -- WE, THE UNITED STATES 

542
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:27,305
AND SPAIN, HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

543
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:27,805
TOWARDS VENEZUELA.

544
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:29,640
THERE ARE A LOT OF SPANIARDS 

545
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,675
LIVING IN VENEZUELA.

546
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,177
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THEM.

547
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,611
ABOUT THEM AND THE REST.

548
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,613
BUT THEY CERTAINLY WORRY ME.

549
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,416
SO I THINK THAT THE 

550
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,183
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD 

551
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:39,750
BE FORCEFUL WITH REGARDS TO 

552
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:48,126
VENEZUELA.

553
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,295
>> THANK YOU.

554
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,597
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR EACH OF 

555
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,833
YOU, FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

556
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:55,900
WITH THE SERIOUS POLITICAL 

557
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,902
CRISIS IN SPAIN, BECAUSE OF THE 

558
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,036
REFERENDUM ON SUNDAY, WHAT 

559
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:01,105
SOLUTION DO YOU THINK THERE IS?

560
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,041
HAVE YOU GIVEN ADVICE TO 

561
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,676
PRESIDENT RAJOY ON THIS MATTER?

562
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:09,080
DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A 

563
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,018
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GENERAL AND

564
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:19,290
THE NOW A SOLUTION FOR PRESIDENT

565
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,592
RAJOY, IT SEEMS THE WAY YOU'RE 

566
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,661
MANAGING THINGS IN CATALONIA HAS

567
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,964
HAD AN IMPACT ON THE BUDGET?

568
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,364
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW 

569
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:30,701
WHETHER YOU THINK THE SITUATION 

570
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,571
WITH THE PMV PARTY CAN BE 

571
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,107
RESOLVED OR HAVE TO CALL 

572
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:36,374
ELECTIONS?

573
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:36,841
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

574
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,944
>> WELL I THINK THE PEOPLE OF 

575
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,744
CATALONIA HAVE BEEN TALKING 

576
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:42,881
ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT I

577
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,483
BET IF YOU HAVE ACCURATE 

578
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,583
NUMBERS, ACCURATE POLLING, 

579
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,119
YOU'LL FIND THEY LOVE THEIR 

580
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,387
COUNTRY, THEY LOVE SPAIN.

581
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,091
SO I'M JUST FOR UNITED SPAIN.

582
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:53,725
I SPEAK AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

583
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,559
UNITED STATES, AS SOMEBODY THAT 

584
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,428
HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR 

585
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,030
PRESIDENT AND ALSO HAS REALLY 

586
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,831
GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR COUNTRY, 

587
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:02,900
I REALLY THINK THE PEOPLE OF 

588
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,569
CATALONIA WOULD STAY WITH SPAIN.

589
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,170
I THINK IT WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT 

590
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:06,437
TO.

591
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,939
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STAYING 

592
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,273
WITH A TRULY GREAT, BEAUTIFUL 

593
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:14,078
AND VERY HISTORIC COUNTRY.

594
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:22,553
>> THANK YOU.

595
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:25,690
>> Translator: WE WILL BE 

596
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,825
DELAYING THE BUDGET IN 

597
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,527
PARLIAMENT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT

598
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,028
WHEN WE SUBMIT THE BUDGETS, WE 

599
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:33,097
WILL NEED THE NEEDED SUPPORT TO 

600
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:33,698
APPROVE THEM.

601
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,132
WE'RE TALKING WITH DIFFERENT 

602
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:37,035
POLITICAL PARTIES, AS YOU KNOW.

603
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,570
AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ANY

604
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,205
PROBLEMS, IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK

605
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:42,640
DOWN THIS LINE.

606
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,308
I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ANY 

607
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:46,143
PROBLEMS IN APPROVING THEM 

608
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:47,578
WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME.

609
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,380
BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A 

610
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,982
MAJORITY, JUST LIKE WE DID LAST 

611
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,885
TIME AROUND WHEN WE VOTED FOR 

612
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:54,285
BUDGET.

613
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,353
AT ANY RATE, I'M NOT THINKING AT

614
00:30:56,353 --> 00:31:00,257
ALL ABOUT CALLING THE ELECTIONS 

615
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,961
AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE'RE 

616
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,194
SEEING.

617
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:03,862
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY

618
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,062

619
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:09,067
THANK YOU.

620
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,568

627
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,781
SAYING HE WAS ASHAMED OF WHAT 

628
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,717
HE'S SEEING IN THE NFL AND 

629
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,721
CALLING ON TO PASS A RULE FROM 

630
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:29,988
KNEELING.

631
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,756

MILITARY OPTION WITH NORTH 

634
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,795

WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING

636
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,999
FINAL WORD FROM THE SENATE.

00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,267
SENATE REPUBLICANS NOW SAY THERE

638
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:45,470
WILL NOT BE A VOTE ON THIS 

639
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,871
LATEST EFFORT TO REPEAL AND

00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:47,972
REPLACE OBAMACARE.

641
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,740
THEY HAD A SEPTEMBER 30th

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,208
DEADLINE.

643
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,241
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT 

644
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,944

MAKING IT CLEAR THAT HE'S MORE 

656
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:18,369
THAN PREPARED TO RESPONSE 

657
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,203
MILITARILY IF NECESSARY TO 

658
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,405
ANYTHING THAT THE NORTH KOREANS 

659
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:20,772

664
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:29,146

00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,090
PREOCCUPIED WITH THE NFL 

669
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,691

00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,965
ACTIONS OF THE NFL PLAYERS 

674
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,400
PROTESTING DURING THE NATIONAL

ABSOLUTELY NOT BACKING DOWN.

677

YOU GET THE SENSE THAT IS AN 

678
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,071
ISSUE THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS 

679
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,405
TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT OVER AND 

680
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,306

00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,779
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S WORKING
