Shannon: JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE CONFIRMED ON SATURDAY. ALSO SAYING THE WHOLE CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS BEEN FAIR AND THOROUGH. SENATOR GRASSLEY THEN TURNING TO THE DEMOCRATS STRAIGHT AT THE MEDIA. I WOULD NEVER USE THE WORD FAKE NEWS. I CONSIDER YOU FOLKS POLICEMAN FOR A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE SOME OF YOU HAVE BIAS. I HAVE HAD DEMONSTRATORS IN MY OFFICE FOR TWO WEEKS NOW. THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE INTERVIEWED. THEY SAID, WE ONLY INTERESTED IN INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH. Shannon: HOW FAR FIRED UE GETS! SENATOR, YOU'VE HAD A LONG FEW WEEKS. I HAVE. IT HAS BEEN A LONG FEW MONTHS. THINKING ABOUT THE NOMINATION AND IT WAS ON JULY NINTH, A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE AND THE PREPARATION OF THE DOCUMENTS IN THE HEARINGS ARE 32 HOURS. THE FOLLOW-UP EARRINGS. FOUR AND HALF HOURS IN THE FACILITY TODAY REVIEWING. Shannon: WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? IF ANYTHING I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE REVIEW TODAY IN THE CLASSIFIED SETTING IS EVEN FURTHER GALVANIZING MY BELIEF. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CONFIRMATION. Shannon: ONE OF YOUR DEMOCRAT KIND OF PARKS HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE REPORT. IT IS A INVESTIGATION. THAT IS NOT A FULL AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. Shannon: WHAT YOU SAY TO THAT? WITHOUT DR. FORD AND BRETT KAVANAUGH TO BE REINTERVIEWED. IT WOULD BE THEIR FIRST FBI INTERVIEWS. ON THE SAME POINTS THAT YOU HAVE ALL INVESTIGATED. I THINK THAT SENATOR IS JUST GOING RIGHT INTO THE MARKETING ARM OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. LOOK, WE HAVE SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE EXPERIENCED PROSECUTORS. EXPERIENCE PROSECUTORS PAIRED WE PUT ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR WHO HAS BEEN PROSECUTING CRIMES FOR ALMOST 25 YEARS. WE DID THAT FOR A REASON. WE WANTED STRUCTURE, WE WANTED AN APPROACH THAT WE COULD PRESENT INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD TAKE BEFORE A JUDGE TO GET AN ARREST WARRANT OR TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT. NONE OF THE DATA ROSE TO A LEVEL THAT WOULD KEEP THAT WOULD EVER ALLOW PROSECUTION TO MOVE FORWARD. THERE WERE TWO HOURS ON BOTH SIDES. WE ASKED DR. FORD TO SUBMIT ANY INFORMATION SHE WANTED TO ON THE RECORD WITH THE ADVICE OF HER COUNSEL. WE GAVE DOCTOR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN OPENING STATEMENT, TO GO AS LONG AS SHE WANTED TO GO AND THAT THE END OF HER TESTIMONY WE ASKED HER IF SHE HAD ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD. HOW CAN ANYBODY THINK WITH SEVEN PROSECUTORS, 21 MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXPERIENCE PROSECUTORS THAT THEY'RE GETTING ANYTHING ELSE OUT OF IT? HE WANT THE DELAY. THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS. I THINK JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR HIS GOOD NAME. I THOUGHT I DID A GOOD JOB LAST WEEK. IT'S. IT'S TIME TO VOTE. Shannon: WOULD HE THINK WHO SAID, HIS FAMILY MUCH LIKE PROFESSOR FORD AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN THIS HAD BEEN PUT THROUGH A MEAT GRINDER ESSENTIALLY. HE WAS FIRED UP. PEOPLE FELT LIKE HE SHOULDN'T OF BEEN INTERRUPTING SENATORS. DOES HE HAVE A FAIR CHANCE? TO GO TO THE BENCH? TO HAVE A FRESH START OR DO YOU THINK IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HOUNDED BY THESE ACCUSATIONS? Laura: I DON'T THINK SO. JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN TWICE CONFIRMED, UNANIMOUSLY WELL-QUALIFIED. THEY SPECIFICALLY IN THE RECOMMENDATION TALK ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENTS. WHAT WE SAW LAST WEEK, WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE 32 HOURS OF HEARINGS WHERE HE WAS VERY RESPECTFUL. HE WAS ASKED SOME OUTLANDISH QUESTIONS. HE WAS INTERRUPTED A NUMBER OF TIMES. THAT WAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH. THAT WAS A TEMPERAMENTAL SHOW ON THE BENCH. LAST WEEK WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH. A MAN WHOSE WIFE HAS HAD DEATH THREATS. HAS 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER HAS BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY THIS. THEY ARE DRAGGING HIS NAME THROUGH THE MUD. WE SAW THE MAN, THE FATHER AND THE HUSBAND DEFENDING HIM AND HIS FAMILY. I THINK HE DID IT AND AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. I THINK MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA BELIEVE THE SAME. Shannon: THE IDEA OF GETTING BACK TO CIVILITY, WHERE WE GO FROM HERE? I TOLD THE REPORTER EARLIER TODAY, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE AGENDA THAT WE HAD FOR THE MARKUP FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WE ALWAYS WE DISAGREE. MOST DEMOCRATS WILL VOTE AGAINST THIS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF BIPARTISAN PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH. THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO YOU. GRAHAM HAS HAD THIS. WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND I THINK AND PROVE THE REPUTATION THE COMMITTEE. I THINK IT HAS SUFFERED BY CONFIDENTIALITY BEING BRIEFED. BY THE SPARTACUS MOMENT. BY SENATOR BOOKER. PUBLISHING INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE MADE AVAILABLE WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO. IF I AM SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO HELP A COMMITTEE, BUT I KNOW THAT I EXPOSE ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS, WE HAVE A LOT TO WORK TO DO. A LOT OF THAT BLAME ON THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T RESPECT THE PROCESS. THEY DIDN'T RESPECT THE CHAIR WHO HAS A WONDERFUL REPUTATION. LET'S WORK ON THAT FIRST. LET'S GET THE INSTITUTION OF THE COMMITTEE RIGHT AND THEN LET'S TRY TO GET SOME OF THIS HYPERBOLIC, BACK STABBING BEHAVIOR I SEE EVERY DAY IN THE THREE AND A HALF YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AND HE SAID IT OUT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF IT AND I'M TIRED OF IT. Shannon: I GOT AN EAR FULL OVER THE WEEKEND THE PEOPLE SAID
