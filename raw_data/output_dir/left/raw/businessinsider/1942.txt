00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,590
your form scientists at the University

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Calgary have dug through decade's</font>

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,670
worth of data and study about running

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,350
shoes and the relation to injuries they

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,570
found most of our beliefs about running

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,650
shoes and injuries are false furthermore

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,630
wearing shoes designed to correct your

running form turn out to be mostly

34
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,659
ineffective and even counterproductive

35
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,220
all of their research boils down to one

36
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,660
important thing you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know when</font>

37
