scientists discover a formula for the perfect box office propaganda scientists have confirmed something that we've known for a very long time that there's a formula for perfect movies and therefore perfect propaganda a report from The Guardian in July explains how a team of British scientists found a formula for box office success after analysing data about scripts from 6147 movies using algorithms the researchers found the common elements and successful movies and outlined how to create a movie that performs well not only is this a little unsettling who wouldn't want to know that their emotions can be manipulated by ticking boxes set out by an algorithm but it's also a worrying sign that propaganda is going to be easier than ever for Hollywood to produce the report explains it could be game-changing for both film producers and audiences said a professor of behavioral economics and data science at the University of Birmingham who led the research team she said we know that when we talk about movie production it is a small group of people that make decisions for the viewers we were essentially trying to listen to the viewer to see what they actually want researchers found that movies with a happy sad happy trajectory were the most financially successful which makes sense for biographical films rags to riches came out on top but it was far less successful in mysteries and thrillers for comedies the riches-to-rags arc which allows for a sad ending was by far the least successful the researchers also discovered that man in a whole films a movie where a character experiences a fall before a rise were not the most popular but they were the most talked about and there we have it when Hollywood is increasingly rewriting history pushing propaganda through the big screen and attacking conservatives in as many ways as they can think of this kind of information is very important there is a formula for fooling us if they want issue talked about they'll use a man in the whole movie if they want as wider reaches possible they will choose a happy sad happy trajectory if they want to change how Comedy Works and redefine what is and isn't funny then they'll entangle their story in a riches-to-rags tale humans really are that easy to manipulate especially when the whole industry is singing from the same hymn if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
