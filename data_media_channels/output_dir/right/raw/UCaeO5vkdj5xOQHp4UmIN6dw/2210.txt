into trust to be run by my two sons that

say you're fired goodbye everybody so

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,640

editor I want you to run the site for a

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,750
week if you do a crappy job and I come

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I see the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has dropped</font>

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,039
by three corners defy it who's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,080
charge of the daily wire is the managing

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,600
editor or is it me well it's made

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,920
because I still have the power to fire

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,470
correct beyond that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,229
Trump pink makes a big deal with some

33
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,729
other corporation that trumps going to

34
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:15,869
know about it's a trumpet<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't know</font>

35
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,549
anything that's going on down and Eric

36
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,229
they won't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me what's going up yeah</font>

37
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,820
except that if there's a big headline on

38
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">front page of the New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Times Trump</font>

39
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,060
Inc signs contract with AT&T to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">new AT&T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Center in charlotte right you</font>

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,869
figure that trumps probably going to

42
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,579
read that how do you think Trump's going

43
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,409
to treat that next time the AT&T people

44
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,840
come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him for permission to merge with</font>

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,700
Time Warner like and they say we want is

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,630
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a deal with Time Warner</font>

47
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,970
how is that going to go yeah that's why

48
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so it really is a sticky wicket</font>

49
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,710
it's not easy to solve but this is

50
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,780
insufficient in the office of government

51
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,310
ethics has said that it's a pretty

52
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,250
insufficient policy so listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope</font>

53
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's never any conflict i hope</font>

54
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,460
that Trump operates this in the cleanest

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,170
possible manner I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the Trump</font>

56
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,880
is looking to personally enrich himself

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,740
off of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presidency is very rich man's</font>

58
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,299
begin with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume that after he's</font>

59
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,619
president lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people will want to</font>

60
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,689
buy his brand still so you know I don't

61
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what's going on but if you</font>

62
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,899
want Trump to avoid the appearance of

63
00:02:06,899 --> 00:00:00,000
impropriety is this doesn't exactly work
