a suspected lone gunman identified as Steven Craig paddock committed the largest mass shooting in American history last night killing at least 58 and injuring at least 515 this is still developing those numbers are changing within hours the hashtag thoughts and prayers began trending on Twitter we'll discuss why of all things thoughts and prayers are controversial and under attack then finally finally we will talk to journalists Mary Lane about the relation between the taking the football movement and the right wing winning that we're seeing all around us finally amber at the Amanda Prestidge jacquimo and Jacob arey joined the panel of deplorable zz to talk about John Kasich sleeving the Republican Party he's a Republican I didn't know that US manufacturing soaring and UK schools removing BC and AD dating so is not to offend non-christians I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knoll Joe it's a rough way to start the week the largest mass shooting in American history I don't think that we need to go into the details of what happened how it happened who did this and who did that I think plenty of other people are gonna cover that I want to focus much more on the response what the response says about our culture what it says about how we see ourselves obviously there are a lot of questions how did he come to possess fully automatic weapons those have been practically outlawed for about 80 years although there are there are ways to get them it's just very difficult you know we're mental illness signs ignored did he just snap all all worth talking about but I am more interested in how the cultural response represents a conflict of visions between the left and the right there was this hashtag and started trending thoughts and prayers but it wasn't earnestly people saying we give you our thoughts and prayers it was people mocking the people who were offering thoughts and prayers the first crazy Twitter response was from Hillary Clinton's surprise surprise my dear old cousin Hillary Hillary said the crowd fled at the sound of gunshots imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer which the NRA wants to make easier to get cousin cousin Hillary what come on girl what are you doing obviously a silencer does not silence a gun you can't shoot off a two to three or a five five to six it's still extremely led it lowers it a few decibels but it's still pretty loud so Hillary just exemplifying how little the people who want to take away all of our guns know about guns whatsoever she then tweeted and said and this is what leads into the thoughts and prayers she says our grief isn't enough we can and must put politics aside stand up to the NRA and work together to try to stop this from happening again it's just on the Clintons the thing that defines them is having absolutely no shame no sense of shame whatsoever that the bodies aren't even cool yet before Hillary Clinton tries to score cheap points on the NRA but but it consider this statement we must put politics aside and stand up to the NRA you just said to put politics aside and now you're pushing gun control you're you're offending one of the largest most popular civil rights lobbies in the entire country the NRA which defends our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that's Hillary totally expected I mean you know perhaps a little much even for her but again the Clintons have no sense of shame so who's surprised the hashtag continued Caracalla Vera says eff your thoughts and prayers they mean nothing there is worthless as you are now this woman I don't know who she is describes herself as a marginally talented writer unintentional comedian and future corpse and that that last one I mean she's making a sort of joke I guess but it that actually does get to the point because she's saying she's a future corpse she's not a future heavenly spirit she's not a future reincarnated spirit or whatever she's a corpse her view of the world as a materialist view and so for her the thoughts and prayers are meaningless in people who offer them are jerks from the Twitter account progress of a kind and these all of these accounts have a lot of followers after your thoughts and prayers seriously there is no more insincere meaningless comment in American history it's a disgusting cliché now I can think of a few insincere ones we are the ones you you we've been waiting for you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor i they go on and on and I did not have sex with that woman or wait there are a lot of empty statements that have been made in recent political history but thoughts and prayers perhaps this person really does think that they're empty obviously they're not empty but to someone with a materialist view perhaps that's the case then the Democratic senator from Connecticut my former senator says quote this must stop it is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren't public policy responses to this epidemic there are and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative and difference it's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something there's a lot there's a lot of stupidity in that statement obviously the standing up to the NRA the NRA represents the 100 million Americans who have gone the huge portion of this country that it exhibits it's there that that uses its Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and in a larger percentage of the country that supports that right and supports that important civil right but for Congress to get off its ass that's the statement that's going around and for the thoughts and prayers to be cruelly hollow why are they cruelly hollow now I think the reason that they think it's cruelly hollow is because they don't believe in God if you believe in God then your prayers are in Hollow their prayers that's everybody for all of history has prayed to God and they don't they aren't hollow in traditional religious observance if you think there isn't a God then they are hollow they actually are cruel because to those people there is a public policy solution that's what Chris Murphy says there's a policy solution it's so easy let's just take away all your guns that's the subjects we take away all the guns we get rid of the Second Amendment we undo federalism and then it's so easy well and then these events won't occur these highly emotional disastrous events won't occur now what they're presuming is that something can be done there are about 30,000 gun deaths a year in the United States two-thirds of them are suicide they're predominantly middle-aged men who are killing themselves is is that if we get rid of the guns those guys aren't gonna kill themselves there are there there's more than one way to do it Dorothy Parker wrote a poem about it what about mental illness what about despair which law is going to fix despair which public policy solution which technocratic advancement is going to stop people from viewing the their culture in their life as meaningless now if we could reduce these gun deaths by tooth by getting rid of the Second Amendment getting rid of the federalist system coming state-to-state down to town house to house and taking everybody's guns what would that do to other crime over that due to rape burglary assault with those numbers remain the same if only the bad guys had guns but what would that mean for our relationship to the government what would that mean with about how we view ourselves about how we view ourselves as citizens as individuals with dignity I have some thoughts on all of this but I will save it for the final thought because right now we have we have to cover something obviously much more important than how we view ourselves as a nation in this tragedy we have to talk about these stupid football players getting on their knee again this weekend we actually have to cover it because in for some reason this is a major news story and it does say something about our culture now I have tried to hit this interview with Mary Lane who has an interesting perspective and who thinks that the football protests in Germany played a large role in the right-wing electoral winning in that country we finally got the interview we had to do it offline but we'll cut to it now and hear her take now we finally have to turn our attention to Mary Lane Mary is an excellent journalist she's been with wash of Wall Street Journal the New York Times The Associated Press she's now writing a book about Nazi art and yesterday we tried to interview Mary because she has an interesting perspective from Germany on the relation between football protests and national politics and nationalism apparently America isn't the first country to deal with this obviously there was some Zuckerberg in conspiracy to keep us apart that would not allow us to discuss this hot button social issue but so what we've got you back today Mary explain the entire situation to us and it give us some context on how taken need relates to politics yes I think as many thing Americans thinks they invented things but after this whole policy for the sending of sports and the fact that in Hub City was national pride and something that's specific to our community and even the word and FIFA actually originated in Germany that's so interesting so you saw this happen that is really funny I guess those Germans are so efficient I guess they just do all these terrible things first so an Tifa started their anti-fascist ìshe in germany then now we have an Tifa and the politicizing of sports started in germany and now we have it here what happened in Germany had it out of the the sports issue come up yes essentially this started in I mean a little bit of background is that so in 2006 Germany got this chance to host the World Cup and they were so excited they're really into soccer it caught propulsion but it also brought up this problem because every other country exposed to the World Cup has seen it is this triumph of their national pride and they're so like the ultimate dream of a football player and any country suckling is to sing the national anthem for the World Cup on their own soil and this was never a problem before but in Germany the national anthem since World War Two was so associated with Nazis chill and uber alles right yeah exactly so after World when they came up with the joy under father's song and then afterwards who they decided to keep the song but used a third verse which is about unity and freedom and justice which sounds anodyne but the fact that they kept the same tune was like really awkward and and they took the at least they took out the verse about just killing everybody in the world especially the Jews which is really good that's a lyrical improvement but a big problem in 2006 was in every other country a politician would have said like I'm so proud to be South African and the World Cup is in South Africa in Germany even on going bambor who has been the Chancellor for 12 years to this day will never be caught dead sings and I'm proud to be German and even the phrase like so I've been in Germany nine and a half years I could technically become her but she would never say if gerbil say I get a German passport I would never say no and I'd have to give up my American one by B whole German mm-hmm you would never linguistic would say in German I had become German he's been doing abroad well this raises an interesting point about American exceptionalism too one can become an American because the country was settled by my dear ancestors my religious extremist ancestors who came from the UK through Latin to America then there came the IRA the scots-irish the Irish there were American Indians who integrated the first people we saw were Samoset and and what's the other guys named Squanto and obviously there were black slaves who came over so it's a country that doesn't really have an ethnic identity per se whereas Germany when you think of a German you get an image in your mind when you think of a Frenchman you get a much more pathetic image in your mind and so on and so forth in 2010 because so and this is what we get to Antipa I'm suspicious must a country pop it is that this Turkish in Germany in Berlin and in an area where Turkey would turn the backgrounds and annoying students and tourists have been together since the nineteen fifties they say God got a twenty two meters so what does that like sixty foot flag completely unfamiliar with the metric system but sure I'll take you back for it 60 foot sure so they put it over like all four stories in their house it's German flag and they were they were they've been from Lebanon and they had become German Sisson and they were so proud right any got torn it became his national show sorry because they had people were tearing it down but it wasn't Nazis or far-right people turn it down it wasn't Eva it was the left the left was upset that the immigrants were grateful toward the country that had taken them in so essentially that's what led overs because you know people saw this bird on two thousand ten and that's when the far-right birdy and obviously in teeth and Germany started blooming but then in 2013 the off day the far-right party only got four point seven percent of the vote and everyone was like cuz you have to get five percent to do parliamentary representation but aa date was like hey like we're a really new party and we got 4.5% with no funding like watch out guys because 2017 is coming from the whole the world conference 2014 and then Germany pummeled Brazil 71 in in Brazil was the whole country and you know no one there were no like foul play going on it was just like Germany was the better team and normally you would be look so excited to be being the home country I mean maybe bummed out but Raziel was bummed out but they weren't saying like oh you're racist or something and besides they were colonized by the Portuguese anyway you know hey Germans in the bar weren't depressed they were like like they wanted to win but they were like like like once I got to about 4 1 they were like oh my god oh my god like this giddiness ml is the worst colonization that we've engaged in hundreds of years you know person I was like you know and it and like anecdotal evidence it's not their evidence but the plural of anecdote is data it is true and then the next day I go in the newspapers Germany has a very wide newspaper so every major cities newspaper is widely disturb it and every single one was like ashamed of the fact that the Western self flagellation is endlessly stunning it never ceases to amaze me but now if this is all happening there if politics is downstream of culture we see this happening in Germany ten years later eleven years later what can we look forward to in the United States there's a lot of good news but there's also some you know interesting if you look say yeah down the road consequences of culture so basically the establishment parties that didn't want to take a side on either of anthem problems they had their worst and that meant Vic the miracles party is still raining she's gonna be having 16 years of consecutive power now but she has to team up with these kind of smaller parties the FDP and the greens what was good for America out of that is that Russia Hawks and they're gonna be less oppositional to the idea of spending money on NATO and that is really good news for America because they are he businesses and they are for less regulation but the problem is is that since so many people are divided there might be so much internal gridlock getting into these great benefits for America may not have Mary thank you so much for being here that's a really interesting perspective and nobody's talking about it but it's pretty scary to think about it is pretty strange the analogy to when you think about the crazy leftist culture the lefties ripping down symbols of national pride and the the push rightward that then the culture engages in and how perhaps internal gridlock makes it difficult to do anything something to watch out for I guess it's just things that are coming up in the United States maybe it won't take as long as Germany did okay now it is time to move to our panel of deplorable and do we have an excellent one today we have from The Daily wire Amanda presto Giacomo also from The Daily wire we have Jacob berry and from the Daily Caller we have amber Athey now our first question is going to you Amanda I don't want to harp on this too much but we were talking about political gridlock we're talking about Hillary Clinton moving in on this issue immediately movie and trying to politicize this tragedy immediately president Trump is not exactly an orthodox political player could we see any gun control coming out of this White House I mean yes he's not politically worth attacks in any way but the thing is is that the NRA back President Trump really early on and they poured millions of dollars into his campaign this is like in the primary and they're still pushing out a lot of ads for President Trump against the protests against him etc so sure I never know what President Trump is going to do I know there are a lot of calls on the left for crackdowns on this they're going to exploit the heck out of this tragedy but the NRA has really been there for President Trump so it would be pretty surprising to me if he does kind of crackdown on this let's hope and you know it is true that he's not an orthodox political player but he's been pretty good and in some ways more conservative than I think many of the ostensibly more conservative candidates would have been in office all right enough about this tragedy sorry your last point Amanda oh yes I mean doc O'Connor me for a loop that's the only reason why I'm like hold some recreation I thought he was gonna use that at least to get like funding but that didn't happen he just kind of tosses the Congress so I have a little hesitation but it wouldn't really make sense for him to go at this gun control hope springs eternal in the human breast okay on 2 News John Kasich announced that he might leave the Republican Party he was sucking up to Jake Tapper and explained quote if the party can't be fixed Jake then I'm not going to be able to support the party period that's the end of it Amanda this of course raises one question John Kasich is a Republican learning this for the first time that interview he was talking about how you know basically how trumpism has taking over the Republican Party and you know we're anti-immigrant now oh when I clutch my pearls the thing is during the primary John Kasich stayed in the race to basically you know essentially give Donald Trump that nomination he'll stated when there was no path what was that he killed Cruz he stayed in so long he totally destroyed Cruz's chances 100% he basically gave President Trump the nomination so this is it's all about John Kasich I don't believe anything he says he clutches his pearls when he knows that bodes well with his Ohio constituents but he doesn't really care if he did care about this he window basically clinched the nomination for president Trump during the primary punch anartha amber this seems to me like a classic example of I'm a conservative but I'm not that kind of a conservative ISM which is very prevalent I've noticed it on campuses I've noticed it in polite conversation people say well I'm a conservative but I don't support president Trump please like New York Times please please like me how prevalent is this phenomenon on the right well definitely prevalent enough to pose a problem to President Trump as we saw with the repeal and replace with Obamacare it really only took three or four of those so-called not that kind of conservatives to kill the repeal and replace effort and then when you look at the media it's the same exact thing you'll have former bush staffers getting their cushy gigs at MSNBC and CNN where all they have to do is trash Trump and they get you know their little six-figure salary after they got out of the Bush administration so then you have not only the liberals posing a media challenge to Trump but also these so-called Republicans including John Kasich who are just trying to you know oppose anything Trump doesn't doesn't matter what it is just so that they can be accepted by the mainstream media yeah there's a woman named Anna Navarro who goes she says that she's a Republican strategist that's just the term by the way if you don't do anything but you want to black yeah I mean she where she has worked been associated with these more left-wing campaigns John Huntsman John McCain that sort of thing actually surrounded by the man who's advising John Weaver as well but you know someone like Anna Navarro it seems like her only job is to attack Republicans well nominally being a Republican Jacob is there any place for these squishy the liberal moderates in the Republican Party yes it's called a primary my wife described John Kasich the best during the 2016 GOP primaries she said he's the guy who showed up to the party uninvited and then refused to leave that's exactly John Kasich and for him to just go on this virtue signaling and you look I am NOT Trump's biggest fan I think he's maybe you and John Nolte are tied but but but seriously John Kasich and people like Anna Navarro they make me ashamed of being an entre at vaq it you know it's it's kind of like oh guys just sit down and shut up they do they make you want to do you don't want to defend Trump because of Trump you want to defend it because his critics are so shrieky and frustrating and they make us who are against Trump from a conservative angle think oh maybe we should back Trump right absolutely right in other news us manufacturing activity has hit a 13-year high Ithaca fake construction spending is up Reuters is reporting that in September there is strong gains in new orders raw material prices and points to the underlying strength in the economy even as hurricane Harvey and irma are expected to dent growth in the third quarter so amber is this the winning that trump promised us are you sick and tired of winning definitely not sick and tired of winning you'll never get sick and tired of it but it definitely does sound like winning in terms of what Trump campaigned on and what a lot of his supporters were hoping for when they voted for him as we know a lot of Trump supporters were those blue collar Blue Dog Democrats who previously voted for Barack Obama and then switched to vote for Trump because they were hoping that he was able to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States so this is you know a really good win for those people who said maybe we don't love Trump's personality but we really like the fact that he's sort of campaigning for this forgotten man in middle America yeah for this forgotten man you know between Los Angeles and New York forgotten subject called the economy absolutely what about the trans bathrooms that we all care about okay we have to keep talking about this but unfortunately you can't watch if you are not a subscriber to daily wire.com we have to say goodbye to you on Facebook and YouTube if you are a subscriber thank you thank you for supporting this it keeps the lights on it keeps my cup full of coffe fa so if you're not what you have to do is right now go to daily wired.com you'll pay $10 a month $100 a year what do you get you get no ads on the website you'll get me you'll get the panel of deplorable you get the under Clavin show you'll get the Ben Shapiro show I could go on but I know I'm boring you forget all that you get this you get the leftist tears tumblr this is the most coveted this is the most coveted item on the market today it is the perfect vessel for leftist tears obviously they pour out the National Football League has filled up our entire supply we have to order more so keep ordering them we'll keep shipping you can have those leftist tears hot or cold always salty and delicious go over there right now daily wire calm we'll be right back Jakub some are saying that the reason that the manufacturing growth has surged is because of these hurricanes is a response to the Hurricanes is that true or the Hurricanes playing a role or are they just trying to take away the White House's credit I think they're trying to take away the White House's credit honestly and of course you'll always see an uptick in manufacturing after some sort of disaster and a war is really good for manufacturing but in all honesty I think that this is just an attempt to take credit away from Trump's economic policies which you you have to admit are are doing some good for our economic situation yeah I'm almost sick and tired of winning but enough about that let's talk about ridiculous things that don't really seem to matter in little trivialities on campuses schools across the UK are doing away with the terms BC and AD in favor of BCE before the Common Era and seee Common Era to denote precisely the same thing same dates the Archbishop of Canterbury has blasted the Musa is shameful and reporting has made it clear that Muslim and Jewish leaders quote were also mystified saying that they were not offended by the familiar terms the familiar terms meaning on O Domini the year of our Lord now this was happening even when I was in high school and this gets to the heart of my theory of leftism which is that leftists want the form of the thing but they they don't want the essence of it so they want the form of Western civilization they literally want its mode of dating itself but they don't want the heart of it which is Christianity on O Domini the Year Zero denotes the the year that a man named Jesus Christ was born so does this matter a man is it just a minor thing a couple of letters no big deal it's no big deal right yeah so this is this is kind of what the left does I mean they they always push these about just kind of reminds me of like when there's a monument of the Ten Commandments and nobody complains about except some random liberal activist group you know six dates away and then they take it down I mean they want to disassemble any assemblance or any anything resembling judeo-christian values that basically built Western civilization they want it gone and as we saw just recently with the the whole debate over civil war monuments it's always there's it's always gonna go way too far I mean what they were talking about taking down statues of robert e lee and then two days later an asian guy from ESPN was losing gigs i mean which is ridiculous and it's gonna keep on going mm-hmm amber nobody in the Jewish or Muslim communities in the UK seems to be offended by the terms with which we date our civilization is anybody actually offended by this who is offended by this or is this another classic example of people pretending to be offended on other people's behalf yeah I think most of it is just classic virtru signaling from as amanda said these sort of small fringe liberal groups and i know this is true because these groups will attack people who are supposed to be offended but aren't offended a great example this when i was in college someone actually made a sandwich joke about women on a on facebook and i thought it was hilarious i laughed at it no you don't have to tell me somebody accused me of having internalized misogyny because i laughed at the joke so it's all about these people because they're like oh well how dare you for not being so happy that i'm offended for you can't you see how good of a person i'm being it's true and it's actually harder for us men by the way because we eat the sandwiches and then further internalize the massage and it's a vicious cycle jacob what about the separation of church and state come on man aren't we supposed to keep church and state separate freedom of religion is it really right for us to be dating our calendars by the name of Jesus well if it wasn't for Christians or the church there would be no calendar the Julian calendar was off I think something by three weeks which is what they had before the Gregorian calendar so you're welcome but you know it's very kind of it yeah but I just think that it's it's just virtue signaling it's nothing but showboating I don't personally you should see some of the alternative calendars they've been suggesting and BCE and C is just kind of the easiest ones but they've been suggesting ones where they start marking the years by 10,000 so this year would actually be 1217 I mean they're just they're just are twelve thousand seventeen I mean they're just ridiculous yeah and you have to date it by Lord Xenu and there are a lot of competing metrics and you you bring up another good point so you bring up the point that without Christian Church we wouldn't have this calendar exactly we also wouldn't have separation of church and state we also crisis render unto Caesar that which is Caesars that to God that which is God's and obviously our civilization is Christian it's been formed by Christianity our country is Christian it was formed by Christian ideals of natural law natural rights so without that we simply wouldn't we wouldn't have anything to be arguing about in the first place okay panel get out of here you it's been very fun having you a man amber Athey Amanda presto Giacomo and Jacob berry now it is time to put on my smart glasses for the final thought Ben had a good piece up on Daly wire today called where does evil come from in it he describes psychologist Roy Baumeister's four categories of evil instrumentality threatened egotism idealism and sadism and he adds his own mental illness what does evil look like what form does evil take how does evil express itself in the mind are important psychological questions that emotionally manipulative Democrat politicians willfully ignore when they capitalize on human tragedy to push largely unconnected policy agendas but it's a good question - where does evil come from that question is not ultimately a psychological problem it's a philosophical problem and the answer to that question lies at the heart of the political debates that began seconds after the news of the Las Vegas tragedy were reported for utopians on the left evil comes from bad public policy tweak a few laws here give the government some more power there and we'll be right back in Paradise they say imagine all the people you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one the rest of us know that this is nonsense that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth we are fallen and banished from earthly paradise and wherever there are men there will be evil no government policy or agency can redeem mankind but idealists persist in their delusion because it's far nicer to delude ourselves into thinking that a law can eradicate all evil than it is to face the grotesqueries that we glimpse in the mirror on that I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael nul show come back next time we'll do it all again
