when is the California Democratic party come and talk to you all right and what do they say they say hey great beat this guy you know what's funny chink is the Democratic Party really didn't pay much attention to me because the district was so red at the beginning the local party was really cool so a lot of the people in the local party was really supportive the state didn't really pay any attention to me until I was endorse by our revolution so when our revolutions national chapter endorsed me that's when the the the California Democratic Party started like really contacting me and really tried to get involved with campaign as thought to myself I'm like well I'm a progressive why are they trying to do this and so it just kind of threw me off like I don't know if they think they can flip me or whatever but they're trying to pull me in to establishment type politics and I just respectfully tell them you know we've been running a campaign the way the way that we're running it were corporate free we we believe in single-payer health care and there's how we're gonna continue to run but they just keep trying to pull you back into it and involve you in the establishment process more and more okay so James that's super interesting how well what do you mean pull you into the establish you know there was some there were some people like there's a program that they have called red to blue and what they do is they'll take candidates that they they think potentially could flip a Republican district blue and they'll help them out financially and stuff like that and you know since we don't take corporate money I was like brilliant I mean we can if the party's gonna help us out that's fantastic so I met with some people from the party I won't name any names but they they basically said they're like okay cool we're gonna help you we're gonna set you up with some interviews and stuff like that they go your first interview is gonna be with Philip Morris and I'm like that's tobacco they go yeah your second interview is gonna be with RJ Reynolds oh my god that's also tobacco like why you just handed me off and so they said well this is how it works if you can't take corporate money you fundraise they'll give it to the party the party will charge their Commission and then we'll give it to you so I told them I said you know in good faith I can't actively take the money then if I know it's coming from a corporation I was like that's the same thing it sounds like it's legal money laundering and they said oh no no that's not what it is I'm like now I've been a financial consultant for a long time it sounds like his legal money laundering so you know like I said I said you know if he wants to me walkers if you want to do a mailer if you want to do something to help us out I'm happy with that but enforcers don't think I take any funds if I know it's coming from corporations like that right well they do have some walkers is in our corporate zombies but volunteers that's a really interesting story James super interesting yeah and thank you for being principled enough to to turn it down yeah yeah that's amazing
