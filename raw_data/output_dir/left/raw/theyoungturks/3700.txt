1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,320
>>HEALTH SECRETARY TOM PRICE HAS
RESIGNED.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:09,180
>>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM!

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,050
DOWN GOES PRICE, DOWN GOES

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,050
PRICE!

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,360
>>HE RESIGNED ABOUT AN HOUR
AFTER DONALD TRUMP DRESSED HIM

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,750
DOWN.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,080
TAKE A LOOK.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,140
>>HE'S A VERY FINE MAN BUT WE
WILL MAKE A DECISION SOMETIME

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,399
TONIGHT, HE'S A VERY, VERY FINE
MAN.

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,679
WE HAVE GREAT SECRETARIES,

11
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,170
AND SOME THAT ON THEIR OWN
PLANES AS YOU KNOW, AND THAT

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,170
SOLVES THAT.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,170
BUT WE PUT IN AN
ORDER WITH NO MORE PLANES, IF

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,879
YOU LOOK AT PAST
ADMINISTRATIONS, FOR INSTANCE

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,179
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, TAKE A
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY

16
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,239
SPENT IN THE AIR, THEY SPENT A
LOT OF TIME IN THE AIR.

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,239
BUT I

18
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,350
FELT VERY BADLY BECAUSE
SECRETARY PRICE IS A GOOD MAN

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,980
BUT WE ARE LOOKING INTO
IT VERY STRONGLY.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,439
WE WILL TAKE A LOOK, I'LL BE
ANNOUNCING SOMETHING IN THE

21
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,020
NEAR FUTURE.

22
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
>>UNBELIEVABLE.

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,619
>>WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT VERY
STRONGLY.

24
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,880
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,710
>>QUIET, I'M LOOKING INTO IT!

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,840
>>REALLY STRONGLY!

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,829
THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION SPENT A LOT OF

28
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:23,900
TIME IN THE AIR.

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,509
WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN?

30
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,890
>>IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION SPENT A LOT

31
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,890
OF TIME IN THE AIR.

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,950
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT, NO ONE
HAS.

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,609
>>THAT MEANS THEY DIDN'T USE
PRIVATE PLANES BUT THEY HAD TO

34
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,030
TRAVEL BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR THE
GOVERNMENT, THEY SPENT A LOT OF

35
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,930
TIME IN THE AIR.

36
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,979
WE HAVE A LOT
OF GOOD SECRETARIES.

37
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,940
>>I CAN'T.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,840
>>YOU VOTED FOR THIS GUY.

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,770
>>ALSO, AS HE SAID, I'LL
PROBABLY BE SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,869
ORDER -- MAY BE, I MIGHT SIGN AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER.

41
00:01:58,869 --> 00:01:59,869
HEY MAN, LET US

42
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,869
KNOW WHEN YOU DO.

43
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,759
I MIGHT BE
DOING A LOT OF THINGS TODAY.

44
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,759
BUT

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,149
IF I DO, I WILL TELL YOU. AND
HERE AGAIN -- DON'T TELL US YOU

46
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,700
ARE GOING TO DECIDE ON TOM PRICE
TONIGHT.

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
DECIDE, AND LET US

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,230
KNOW, IT'S A SIMPLE PROCESS.

49
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,510
>>NORMALLY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN
CONSIDERED INCREDIBLY

50
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,430
UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE
LEAVING THE GUY TO DIE OUT

51
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,430
THERE.

52
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,390
IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M GOING
TO DECIDE, THAT'S CRAZY.

53
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,390
MAKE A

54
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,989
DECISION BEFORE YOU GO PUBLIC
BECAUSE IF YOU GO PUBLIC IT

55
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,599
LOOKS TERRIBLE.

56
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,239
NOT ONLY FOR TOM
PRICE BUT FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU

57
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,569
LOOK SO DISORGANIZED.

58
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,629
>>WEAK.

59
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,870
>>HE IS SO USED TO LOOKING LIKE
A CLOWN, WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE

60
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,030
RED NOSE?

61
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:55,940
DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE
SAID ABOUT PUERTO RICO?

62
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
PUERTO

63
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,010
RICO, TURNS OUT IT'S AN ISLAND
SURROUNDED BY WATER.

64
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,010
BIG WATER.

65
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,010
I SWEAR TO GOD HE SAID BIG
WATER.

66
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,129
OCEAN WATER.

67
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,129
WHAT OTHER

68
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,850
KIND OF WATER WOULD YOU BE
SURROUNDED BY IN PUERTO RICO?

69
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,010
>>WHEN HE MADE THOSE STATEMENTS
ABOUT PUERTO RICO BEING AN

70
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,040
ISLAND THAT IS SURROUNDED BY
WATER, I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,390
HOW MUCH CRAP SARAH PALIN GOT
WHEN SHE TOLD KATIE COURIC SHE

72
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,120
COULD SEE RUSSIA FROM HER HOUSE.

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,870
I MEAN, WE HAVE DEVOLVED AS A

74
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,870
COUNTRY.

75
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,290
AT LEAST DURING THE
SARAH PALIN DAYS THERE WAS JUST

76
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,939
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT
THAT'S KIND OF UNACCEPTABLE.

77
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:34,939
BUT

78
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,480
NOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS
THINGS LIKE PUERTO RICO IS AN

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,750
ISLAND SURROUNDED BY BIG WATER.

80
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,260
>>THREE STRAIGHT ELECTIONS, I
FORGOT ABOUT PALIN -- TAKE

81
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
STOCK.

82
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,260
GEORGE W. BUSH, SARAH
PALIN, DONALD TRUMP.

83
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,709
>>YOU ARE THE DUMB PARTY.

84
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,560
>>THERE ARE SMART GUYS WHO ARE
REPUBLICANS WHO WE DISAGREE

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,959
WITH, THEY HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW
GOVERNMENT SHOULD SHRINK AND HOW

86
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,110
IT WOULD WORK AFTERWARD.

87
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,910
NOBODY
WOULD SAY JOHN KASICH IS A DUMB

88
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,530
GUY, OR JEB BUSH -- MAYBE SOME
PEOPLE WOULD.

89
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,530
BUT HE WAS

90
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,530
GOVERNOR, HE MADE STUFF WORK, WE
DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT -- JOHN

91
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,530
HUNTSMAN, THERE ARE TONS.

92
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,530
BUT
YOU GUYS KEEP ELECTING THE

93
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,530
DIMMEST BULBS IN YOUR CLOSET TO
LEAD THE PARTY.

94
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,530
>>THAT GOES TO AN IMPORTANT
POINT, WE WILL GET TO PRESS IN A

95
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,120
SECOND -- IT'S NOT JUST
LEADERSHIP, IT'S THE VOTERS.

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
YOU

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,370
MIGHT FIND THAT MORE OFFENSIVE,
BUT YOU HAD 17 CHOICES IN THAT

98
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,370
PRIMARY AND YOU CHOSE THE
DUMBEST GUY.

99
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,370
YOU COULD HAVE

100
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,370
CHOSEN JOHN MCCAIN IN 2000, BACK
THEN I VOTED FOR HIM, BUT YOU

101
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,370
CHOSE THE DUMB GUY.

102
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,370
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT YOU.

103
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,370
>>I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE
COUNTRY, NOT JUST REPUBLICANS,

104
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,370
BUT WE ARE NOT NUMBER ONE, WE
ARE NOT THE BEST COUNTRY.

105
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,370
I LOVE

106
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,370
MY COUNTRY, THIS IS WHERE I WANT
TO LIVE AND I WANTED TO BE GREAT

107
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,370
-- BUT MANY THINGS -- THE IDEA
OF AMERICA IS BY FAR THE BEST

108
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,370
IDEA WE HAVE HAD.

109
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,370
BUT WE KEEP
DOING DUMB THINGS, AND WE

110
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,370
CELEBRATE DUMBNESS, WE CELEBRATE
GUYS WHO WALK AROUND AND PEE

111
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,370
LIKE A DOG AFTER THEY SCORE A
TOUCHDOWN AND WE CELEBRATE

112
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,370
GEORGE W. BUSH AND DONALD
TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

113
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,370
AND I APOLOGIZE INSTANTLY TO
BUSH FOR INCLUDING HIM IN

114
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,370
THAT SENTENCE.

115
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,300
>>I HAVE TO GET THIS OUT OF THE
WAY, THINK ABOUT THE TYPE OF

116
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,570
RHETORIC YOU HEAR FROM THE RIGHT
IN THE PAST ELECTION IN REGARD

117
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,570
TO EDUCATION.

118
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,570
IN REGARD TO
KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE TALKING

119
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,570
ABOUT AND PROVIDING DATA AND
FACTS TO BACK UP YOUR ARGUMENTS.

120
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,570
YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY GET CAST
OFF AS ELITIST, BECAUSE HAVING

121
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,570
EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THE
ARGUMENTS YOU ARE MAKING IS

122
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,570
SOMEHOW A BAD THING THAT MAKES
YOU AN ELITIST, AND THERE WAS

123
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,570
THIS OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF LOGIC
AND REASON AND IT DROVE ME

124
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,570
INSANE.

125
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,570
>>IT'S NOT TEMPORARY, IT'S NOT
A LITTLE THING THAT MADE YOU

126
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,570
INSANE, IT'S THE DIRECTION THE
COUNTRY HAS BEEN GOING FOR YEARS

127
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,570
NOW. AND DEVOS AND --

128
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,570
>>YOU CAN'T CALL HER DEVOS, THAT
SOUNDS TOO COOL.

129
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,570
>>THAT IS AN INSULT TO DEVO,
THEY WERE GREAT BAND.

130
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,570
AND THE

131
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,570
CLOWN WHO IS THE HEAD OF SCIENCE
AT NASA NOW.

132
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,570
THE GUY WITH THE

133
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,570
NINE CHINS.

134
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,570
HE'S DUMB SO I TAKE
BACK THE -- BUT HE'S NOT A

135
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,570
SERIOUS PERSON.

136
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,570
CAN I READ A
COUPLE TWEETS IN REGARD TO

137
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,570
THINGS YOU MENTIONED?

138
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,570
FIRST OF
ALL MICHAEL SHURE, SUBTWEETING

139
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,570
THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET ABOUT BIG
WATER, BIG OCEAN, AND ISLAND

140
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,570
SURROUNDED BY BIG WATER, HE
WROTE "ALWAYS PANDERING TO BIG

141
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,570
WATER."

142
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,570
THAT IS FUNNY, PEOPLE
SHOULD RUN WITH THAT.

143
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,570
AND TODAY

144
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,570
BEFORE TOM PRICE GOT FIRED, TONY
PERKINS FROM THE FAMILY COUNCIL,

145
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,570
THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT SECRETARY
PRICE'S ETHICS, IT'S ABOUT

146
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,570
TRYING TO DISCREDIT ONE OF THE
MOST EFFECTIVE SOCIAL

147
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,060
CONSERVATIVES IN WASHINGTON.

148
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,920
NO, IT WAS ABOUT THE ETHICS.

149
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,910
IT WAS SO SCANDALOUS YOU COULD
NOT NOT COVER IT.

150
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,200
>>AS PRIVATE JET TRIPS.

151
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,050
>>PAY $25,000 TO FLY TO
PHILADELPHIA WHEN IN TRAIN COSTS

152
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,910
TWO HOURS AND COSTS $75?

153
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:35,050
>>I DON'T BUY FOR A SECOND THAT
IT IS OVER THESE CHARTERED

154
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,490
FLIGHTS, I THINK IT HAS EVERY
THING TO DO WITH TRUMP BEING

155
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,600
BITTER ABOUT THE FACT THAT TOM
PRICE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT

156
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,430
HEALTHCARE.

157
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,470
BECAUSE THE STORM
EVER CARE ABOUT ETHICS OR

158
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,940
TAXPAYER MONEY GOING TOWARD
RIDICULOUS, LAVISH TRAVEL FOR

159
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
HIS CABINET MEMBERS?

160
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
HELL NO.

161
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,750
>>WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE HEAR
SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE IN THE

162
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,360
WHITE HOUSE.

163
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,920
I SUSPECT IT IS
MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT, BUT THERE

164
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,060
COULD BE SOMETHING TO IT.

165
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,220
TRUMP
WOULDN'T WANT TO FIREPLACE TO

166
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,970
CALL ATTENTION TO HIS FAILURE TO
HEALTHCARE, YOU PICKED A GUY TO

167
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,350
DO IT AND HE COULDN'T.

168
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,430
I'M SURE HE'S DISAPPOINTED IN
HEALTHCARE, SO HE HOLDS TOM

169
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,040
PRICE RESPONSIBLE, BUT NOW TOM
PRICE WALKS INTO SOMETHING

170
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,120
AND HE'S LIKE, I CAN FIRE HIM
NOW.

171
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,680
>>THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT REPORTS
THAT NOT ONLY THE THINGS HE SAID

172
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,500
PUBLICLY BUT THAT PRESENTLY
TRUMP IS MEDIC TOM PRICE FOR NOT

173
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:38,160
GETTING TRUMPCARE PASSED, AND OF
COURSE PUBLICLY HE ONCE JOKED AT

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,830
A RALLY, HE POINTED TO PRICE WHO
WAS ON STAGE, HE SAID HE BETTER

175
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,870
GET IT, OTHERWISE I WILL SAY
TOM, YOU'RE FIRED.

176
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,230
>>THAT WAS THE BOY SCOUTS
JAMBOREE.

177
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,781
>>HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE WAS
JOKING, HE DID THIS, LIKE, YOU

178
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,580
KNOW ME.

179
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,280
>>INTERNAL REPORTING INDICATED
HE WASN'T JOKING.

180
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,470
LET'S BREAK

181
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,470
THAT DOWN.

182
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,620
NUMBER ONE, HE'S A
CLOWN, HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW

183
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,750
GOVERNMENT WORKS.

184
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,440
SO YOUR
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,650
SERVICES SECRETARY IS IMPORTANT,
BUT CAN THEY RALLY THE VOTES

186
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,870
NEEDED IN THE SENATE?

187
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,850
IT'S NOT
EXACTLY THE RIGHT -- FIRST OF

188
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,440
ALL THEY CAN'T DO IT
UNILATERALLY, OF COURSE NOT,

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

190
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,750
YOU HAVE
THE VOTES OR YOU DON'T. CAN THEY

191
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,170
CRAFT LEGISLATION?

192
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,950
NOT REALLY.

193
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,960
AND IF ANYONE WILL TWIST ARMS TO

194
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,550
GET VOTES, WHAT POWER DOES THE
GUY AT HHS HAVE?

195
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,550
IT'S EITHER THE

196
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,570
PRESIDENT OR MITCH MCCONNELL
THAT GETS IT DONE OR DOESN'T. SO

197
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,710
TO WEIRDLY BLAME YOUR HEALTH
SECRETARY, BASICALLY, IS TO

198
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,560
MISUNDERSTAND THE PROCESS.

199
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
IF I
HAVE A BAD DAY ON AIR I WON'T

200
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
TURN TO THE ACCOUNTANT AND GO
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO A BETTER

201
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
TALKSHOW?

202
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,340
IF YOU SCREWED UP THE ACCOUNTING
I WOULD SAY IT'S HIS FAULT.

203
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,200
>>IT'S ALMOST LIKE REQUIRING THE
ACCOUNTANT TO RAISE MONEY.

204
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,990
HE MANAGES THE MONEY BUT HE
DOESN'T RAISE MONEY.

205
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,270
HE MAKES SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY TO OPERATE AND DON'T

206
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,270
BREAK THE LAW.

207
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,390
>>THAT'S A PERFECT ANALOGY,
THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY BETTER.

208
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,450
THAT IS WHAT DUMB PEOPLE DO WHO
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

209
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,450
ACCOUNTANT DOES.

210
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
THE ACCOUNTANT
TRACKS THE MONEY, HE DOESN'T

211
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,450
RAISE MONEY.

212
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:20,470
THE SECRETARY OF
HHS DOESN'T DO A WHIP COUNT IN

213
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:30,090
CONGRESS AND PASS A BILL, HE
APPLIES THAT ONCE IT PASSES.

214
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,789
IT'S HIS JOB TO MAKE SURE IT IS
APPLIED RIGHT.

215
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,789
COULD THEY HAVE A

216
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,589
SMALL ROLE IN WHIPPING PEOPLE,
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE CAME FROM

217
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,620
THE HOUSE, MAYBE A LITTLE.

218
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,339
>>ONE OF THE REASONS TRUMP
PICKED SO MANY PEOPLE FROM

219
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,420
CONGRESS IF HE WAS HOPING THAT
WOULD SORT OF HAVE SOME SORT OF

220
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,399
SVENGALI-LIKE EFFECT ON THEIR
ABILITY TO PERSUADE THEIR

221
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,399
COLLEAGUES.

222
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,740
BUT TOM PRICE WAS IN
THE HOUSE AND HAS NO SWAY IN THE

223
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,910
SENATE.

224
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,500
IF HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED
IN CRAFTING THE HEALTHCARE

225
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,110
LEGISLATION, HE IS AN ORTHOPEDIC
PHYSICIAN, COULD HE HAVE HAD

226
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,439
SOME ROLE THERE?

227
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,939
BUT HE DOESN'T
BECAUSE ALL THEY WANTED TO DO

228
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:12,639
WAS REPEAL OBAMA CARE.

229
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,800
THE RIGHT
CLAIMS OBAMACARE WAS RAMMED

230
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,149
THROUGH BUT THERE WERE 18 MONTHS
OF HEARINGS, IT WASN'T RAMMED

231
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,149
THROUGH.

232
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,860
IT DIDN'T PASS WITH
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT BUT IT WASN'T

233
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,500
RAMMED THROUGH.

234
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,810
THESE WERE
RAMMED THROUGH WITHOUT HAVING

235
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:36,490
ANY LEGISLATION, THEY FIRED BILL
AFTER BILL, THEY ARE LITTLE

236
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,949
TRICKS DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU
THINK THEY ARE PASSING SOMETHING

237
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,740
WHEN ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS
REPEAL.

238
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
SO EVEN THE IDEA THAT

239
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,570
TOM PRICE COULD HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN CRAFTING

240
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,570
LEGISLATION, THERE WAS NO
LEGISLATION.

241
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,670
AND WHAT TOM PRICE

242
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,720
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE IN WAS
IMPLEMENTING WHATEVER LAW YOU

243
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,620
PASSED.

244
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,759
>>AND FINALLY A SECOND
MISUNDERSTANDING HERE IS OK, HE

245
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,319
SPENT $400,000 ON AIRPLANES AND
HE SAID DON'T WORRY, I WILL GIVE

246
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:06,610
YOU BACK A LITTLE LESS THAN
52,000

247
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,890
FOR THE PRICE OF MY SEAT ON A
PLANE.

248
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,790
>>A BUSINESS CLASS TICKET.

249
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,459
>>TO BE FAIR TO TOM PRICE I
DON'T KNOW THAT HE HAS

250
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,680
$400,000, AND ALL HE CARES ABOUT
IS MONEY.

251
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
>>HE WAS WORTH $14 MILLION.

252
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
AS
YOU MIGHT IMAGINE HE IS ONE OF

253
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,949
THE MORE POOR MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S
CABINET BUT HE'S WORTH 14

254
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:29,949
MILLION.

255
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,019
>>DRAIN THE SWAMP.

256
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:37,160
>>HOW HE IS NOT A CRIMINAL I
DON'T QUITE KNOW.

257
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,880
HE ADVOCATED LEGISLATION TO
BOOST COMPANIES THAT HE HAD

258
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,220
A PERSONAL INVESTMENT IN.

259
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,850
>>THAT'S PARTLY WHAT I WAS
GETTING AT, THEY TALK ABOUT

260
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,889
DRAIN THE SWAMP, WASTING
GOVERNMENT RESOURCES, THEY CLAIM

261
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,209
TRUMP WAS MAD ABOUT THAT AND
ELITES ARE GOING AROUND IN

262
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:55,379
PRIVATE PLANES, THAT'S NOT
DRAINING THE SWAMP -- NO, THERE

263
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,540
ARE MUCH BIGGER PROBLEMS WITH
DRAINING THE SWAMP.

264
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,540
TOM PRICE IN

265
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,970
ESSENCE DID INSIDER TRADING WITH
INFORMATION HE HAD AS A

266
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,600
CONGRESSMAN THAT THE REST OF US
DIDN'T HAVE, THEY HAD TO PASS A

267
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,230
WHOLE LOT TO MAKE SURE YOU
COULDN'T KEEP DOING WHAT TOM

268
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,110
PRICE WAS CONSISTENTLY DOING IN
THE HOUSE.

269
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,110
I'VE GOT SOME

270
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,190
INFORMATION YOU DON'T KNOW, I
WILL TRADE ON THAT.

271
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,190
THAT'S PART

272
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,740
OF HOW HE MADE THE MONEY, THAT'S
THE SWAMP.

273
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,200
TRUMP NEW THAT WHEN

274
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,730
HE SELECTED PRICE, SO THIS IS A
MOLEHILL COMPARED TO THE

275
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,430
MOUNTAIN OF CORRUPT DEALINGS TOM
PRICE HAD IN THE PAST WHICH

276
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,370
TRUMP LOVED.

277
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,620
THAT'S SAVVY, WAY
TO CHEAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

278
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,490
AND TALK ABOUT SAVING MONEY OR
NOT, 400,000 IS TERRIBLE AND HE

279
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,319
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, BUT
TRUMP TODAY ANNOUNCED A BILL

280
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:43,990
THAT WOULD COST US TRILLIONS OF
DOLLARS, THOSE ARE TAX CUTS THAT

281
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,920
WILL GO TO THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN
THE COUNTRY, TO CORPORATIONS WHO

282
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,660
ARE TRUMP'S DONORS,
THAT'S THE SWAMP.

283
00:11:54,660 --> 00:00:00,000
TRILLIONS, NOT THAT 400,000 ON
THE PLANE.
