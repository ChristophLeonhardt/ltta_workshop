my name is Connor Brinson and I am the founder and president of GC young Americans for freedom it's really great honor to have mr. Clavin out I don't know if any of you have heard but we actually have an overflow room because of the demand so I think that just shows a kind of market for conservative ideas on campus and I think that's a really a great thing to kind of start the night with so a little bit of background on kind of why I founded the club just real quick before we start I actually got to go out to the Ragan ranch with which the young Americans for freedom has been now owning for many several years and they keep that property just as a reminder of all of the great things that Ronald Reagan did for our country and it was that experience that kind of made me want to start this chapter on campus one thing just to thank people real quick this event would not be possible without the generosity of the young Americans foundation so let's give a quick round of applause for them secondly I'd like to thank our amazing young Americans for freedom board I mean they are the hardest working team at Grand Canyon I'm just gonna say that outright the amount of hours that we put in these past few weeks for this event it's really been incredible to see what these kids can do so one more round of applause for them and then one last round of applause for all of our event donors they're the ones who also just make this possible and kind of make it so that way we can bring out speakers like Clavin to campus and based on the demand that's really great so one more round of applause all right so now that that's out of the way let's get down to the nitty-gritty so obviously if any of you have watched

right well thank you very much for coming and thank you to the young America's Foundation the young Americans for freedom for arranging all this I appreciate it I was asked to speak about Christianity in the culture which is a an important topic to me because I became a Christian because of the culture not because of the Bible not because of going to church not because of preaching but by reading books and watching movies that ultimately led me to Christ and I'll talk a little bit about that but what I want to do is I want to give a what I hope will be a very brief speech because I'd like to hear your questions in two parts first I'd like to talk about where we are where Christianity stands in the culture right now and why and then I'd like to tell a little bit about my story so because it's a a good example of how the culture can change and why and how the culture should change to bring people back to our foundational religion but first I want to tell a joke it's an old joke and many of you may some of you may have heard it but it makes a really important point it actually is it has a lot to do with what I want to say guys going to a job interview and it's the big job right it's the job he's wanted all his life and it's another job like this could come up for 20 years and he's all set he's primed he's dressed he's drives to the office building and he can't find a parking space he drives around he drives around the block and he realizes he's going to be late for this interview he's gonna lose this job and he starts to sweat he starts to pray he says Lord if you will send me a parking space I will do whatever you want I will go to church every Sunday for the rest of my life if you will send me a parking space I'll give a every penny I earned the rest of my life to charity I'll raise my children in the faith out volunteer my time I'll be faithful and suddenly he's driving by the front of the building and a car pulls out the parking space opens up and he says oh never mind Lord there's one now that's exactly where we are in what in Western cultures relationship with Christianity Western culture is formed as we know it is formed by Christianity it starts out as a bunch of diverse tribes and nations called Christendom it is the people who believe in Christ and everything you think and everything the people who disagree with you think and everything we fight about all our values and all the things we look for and you think are good everything we think it is to be a human being was all formed by the Christian Church and the result is that you are living in the freest richest healthiest least depressed most fair civilization that has ever existed on the face of the planet of the planet yeah I mean people talk about all of those microaggressions and there's you know all kinds of terrible problems I can't use the bathroom the girls bathroom if I want to this is the fairest richest freest healthiest place that has ever existed for millennia people with literal shackles on their wrists women watching their babies die of things that we can cure now with a pill whole races of people who lived and died face down in the dirt with the boot of power on the back of their neck looked up to heaven and said please Lord send us a culture like this one and here it is in our attitude is oh never mind Lord there's one now the narrative that you hear from our elites and people these are people I love their books I read their books I know some of them books like Steven Pinker's new book enlightenment now and my pal John at Goldberg's book the suicide of the West they're selling a narrative that goes like this for centuries the church kept us in darkness and superstition and then hurrah the Enlightenment came and there was reason and science and we were free and we have to leave religion behind and it's only troglodytes and fools who want to drag us back into the dark ages this narrative is all this narrative started with the Renaissance the Petrarch a great Italian poet who is they say that he jumps started the Renaissance by rediscovering the letters of the Roman statesman Cicero and he invented the idea that all the years before this moment were the dark ages and people who lived in the Dark Ages didn't think they were in the Dark Ages like nobody walked around going lights these ages you know they're dark now I can't wait for the Enlightenment to come so I can see what I'm doing you know it's like that didn't happen in the Middle Ages we all say medieval he's gonna go medieval on you you know it just means Middle Ages it was a slur invented in the Renaissance and the idea was first we had these great Roman and Greek civilizations and now we have the wonderful Renaissance and everything in the middle was the Middle Ages it wasn't been nothing much going on it was the Middle Ages none of this is true and now historians kind of are finding out that it's not true all the things that happened in the Renaissance were prepared by the Christian Church after Rome fell and all these barbarian tribes came in to the what had been the Roman Empire it was the church who taught them how to think again what the value what to believe and far from being the enemies of reason they brought reason back to these savage tribes great philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and Thun SCOTUS these are guys who took the philosophy of ancient Rome Aristotle and melded it with the thought of st. Paul and the gospel of Jesus had taught these people how to think again and far from science being the enemy of religion this is another myth that there was there was a famous book called the war between science and religion Christianity invented science you know when you look at Western science and when I say Western science is a redundancy there only is Western science Western Westerners invented science everyone who could be credited with inventing science was a deeply believing Christian Galileo is a Dean of the church and Newton and Oh Roger Bacon was a Franciscan friar Francis Bacon no relation I think you know these are the guys who kind of invented the idea that we should observe nature and we shouldn't be let our minds be curtailed by superstition we should look at what's going on Francis Bacon just to give you a an idea of the way these guys think thought the way they all thought Francis Bacon said they either deny a god destroy man's nobility for certainly man is of kings of the beasts by his body and if he be not of kin to God by his spirit he is a base an ignoble creature this is what these guys believe in why it's why they invented science everything we have everything we are whether you're a Muslim or a Jew or an atheist whether you're a gay activist doesn't matter if you are part of the West if you are part of the great conversation of the West the big argument of the West you were shaped by Christianity the church is in some sense your mother and this for me solves part of the paradox of why Christianity is under attack I mean for guys like me I'm a political conservative and I look at my friends on the left and they allow Islam to get away with stuff that they would never tolerate from a Christian depending on how you count Wars Islam is involved in something like ten of the twelve wars going on right now but if you point out that this may be part of partly because of their philosophy you're a terrible terrible human being there have been approximately six fatal attacks by lunatics on abortion clinics that were related tax related to Christianity that of course shows you that Christians are violent monsters who can hold polite conversation I've yet to see a gay couple going through an Muslim bakery and insist that they cater their wedding doesn't happen you ever see a movie does anybody ever seen the movie V is for Vendetta the atheist ruin does many but the guys who made the matrix writing is based on a graphic novel dystopian futuristic novel where the Christians are the fascists right the Christians of the terrible freshness is a great actor named Stephen Fry plays the gentle gay professor who has to hide in his basement where he hides his Koran somebody says to him the Koran he says well you don't have to believe in it to appreciate how beautiful it is meanwhile the Christians come down they can't you know they carry him away because they are the tyrants there eat Muslim countries where homosexuality is a capital offense they kill you for it right but you never hear anybody on the left talk about this at all you never hear him say a word but if Mike Pence god forbid the vice-president should say you know as a Christian I'm not sure that homosexuality is necessarily the optimal thing it's like oh my god this meant you know Joy Behar on the view you know this man is mentally ill he talks to Jesus Jesus you know he's out of his mind you go online you can look up Mike Pence all you'll find her images of them with death rays coming out of his eyes you know well and so why is it what why the you know disparity it's because the church is our mother you know I had a I have a daughter you listen to things from your friends if a girl gets dressed in the morning and her roommate says to her you know the top is a little revealing put on a sweater to put on a sweater but if her mother says to her you know you're going out like that it's like mom you know please this is you're calling me terrible name we react to our parents different they say your parents can always press your buttons because they install the buttons the church installed our buttons and it drives us crazy and this also explains this incredible hostility among our elites in Hollywood in the news toward the Christian religion I mean I hardly have to rehearse the things that happen but I'll go through some of them because they're they're important we all know that any time a Christian shows up in a in a movie he's a bigot he's small minded if he's a priest he's raping people you know he's always it's always the villain I mean I could go through you know you carry I mean they just remade Carrie Stephen King is the evil Christian who locks her daughter locks her daughter in a closet because she's developing breasts because Christians hate breasts they we don't actually we don't actually reproduce we reproduced by as Moses you know mitosis sorry is it you know Footloose where you're not allowed to dance you know because you're a Christian my favorite is it I had this made reference maybe too old for something you know The Da Vinci Code you ever read the division you can live in G code the Catholics assassinate people because they don't want him to find out that Jesus was married and has a descendant and I thought so what you know what's his descendant King of the Jews you know good luck getting that job you know but I'm showing up I am The King of the Jews even the Bible movies are anti-christian you know this is this is one of the funny things are part of the narrative of intellectuals was that religion was supposed to disappear right because it's mom we left we left home they are the old folks I don't even know how to you know program an iPhone there they're full of superstition and darkness and stupidity we're nothing like them we're nothing like that when 9/11 happened one of truly in in the intellectual world one of the biggest shocks was that anybody cared enough about God that kill you for it I mean that was one of the things that shocks people that religion was still such a force in the world and they could understand it because it was a force for evil which is what they thought anyway just the other day David Brooks was one of the very very elite columnist in The New York Times said there's not Islamic terrorism because of Islam it's because these are young men without jobs I thought that's not what they say you know they say we are killing you because of Islam and it's like David books say no no my friend you know I'm with the New York Times I know why you're really killing when Mel Gibson made The Passion of the Christ he paid for it out you know 25 million dollars out of his own pocket which okay he had in his pocket but still you know that's what he put up for it because they had no clue that it was going to earn I'm not even sure now I think it's earned close to a billion dollars that film if it had been about anything else that had been about spider-man do you think they would have made sequels you know I mean if you've been about anything else the book of Acts would have been in the can the next day they would have filmed that thing you know like revelation you know Jesus he's back and this time he's ticked off you know but but they were stunned they were shocked they destroy I mean I used to I used to joke that you know what happened that Jesus in that movie was nothing compared to what happened to Mel in Hollywood because they just they basically destroyed him from making that film and yeah oh did he have dark parts you know who ever heard of a an artist with dark parts of course he had dark parts to his personality but they seized on them and destroyed them Roman Polanski raped a little girl that was fine but Mel Gibson believed in Jesus get out of town but slowly because there was so much money on the table they started to build faith-based divisions in their companies the studios and even then when they made Bible movies they were anti Bible they would make movies like Noah with Russell Crowe where God destroys the world because we're not environmental enough we're not green enough it was no sin it was just you're not treating you know God was just green it's like the green God was coming to destroy the earth they make the Moses story gods and kings with the Batman got Christian Bale and when I gave interviews and said Moses was kind of a terrorist so Christians didn't show up for the movie and now so help me what they say in Hollywood is people don't like biblical movies and I say to him yeah they don't like biblical movies the trash the Bible you know that's not with you but they there are so divided so hostile for the faith that formed them that they cannot get it through their heads that people might believe now our response is equally problematic when I say our I mean the Christian response is equally problematical for me there are a lot of Christians in in Hollywood we meet in secret but we do meet and we talk about things how to make movies and and they do have figured out how to get movies made and how to make them cheaply and how to make a big profit on them but the movies you know I know if people who make them and I don't want to say that they're awful but maybe they're not helpful they're all the same you know like a professor it says there's no god but then they convince him he's got there is a God and he gets hit by a bus but it's okay he's going to heaven you know it's great everything's fine and then they see a rock song and there are you know like two young young people have sex the girl gets pregnant cuz in Christian movies you can never have sex out of wedlock without getting pregnant you know like in real life people have sex out of wedlock and they're like hey you know I thought it was good but but Chris in Christian movies you're in trouble the minute the minute you look at each other across the room and then she you know she's gonna she's gonna get an abortion no he's gonna find scry stand he takes care of her and everything's great everything's always great so why do I hate these films you know I did not become a Christian until I was I was baptized at the age of 49 I made my living as a crime writer writing tough-guy stuff that's what I loved I loved stuff stories about hookers and gangsters and killers and cops that's what I wrote stories about and when at the age of 49 I realized that I was a Christian which took me completely by surprise I went up I drove up into the hills I live in California so I pray a lot in my car because it's the only place here alone and I drove up to the hills and I serious I said please God whatever happens do not let me become a Christian writer because I was so afraid that one day I would be writing these stories about gangsters and killers and then I'd be baptized in the next day I'd be writing stories about like Suzy lost her bunny but Jesus brought it back again you know and I just like please don't let that happen to me and the reason for this is because of my own story and where I came from let me just tell you a couple of like scenes from a 35 year conversion I was born and raised a Jew and I was trained in the Jewish faith but my parents didn't believe in God so I didn't make any sense to me why am I talking this far in religion why am I wearing the funny hat what am I doing here if there's no God so I was estranged from the Jewish religion by the time I was 13 I walked away but I loved these tough guy writers it's a great strain of American writers guys like Ernest Hemingway Raymond Chandler who wrote the famous Philip Marlowe mystery stories Dashiell Hammett who wrote The Maltese Falcon these were my heroes and I wanted to be a tough guy writer like them and so I decided well I better study these guys and see what they're talking about and I started to learn that one of the things that linked them all together well worth Eames from chivalry The Maltese Falcon was kind of a Holy Grail story Raymond Chandler was always comparing Philip Marlowe to a night and Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is also linked to the story of the Holy Grail so I started to read the stories of the Arthurian Knights and the Holy Grail and I realized these books were about Christian manhood they were how to be a man when you are a Christian that's what the Arthurian legends are about so I thought well I don't know anything about Christianity right but I didn't we didn't even have a New Testament in the house so I went out and bought a New Testament and I went in my room and I lay down on my bed and I started reading the Gospel according to Luke I think I picked that one because it had the Christmas story and that night Christmas was nice you know and my father walked in on me now I don't wanna give you too much information I was a 15 year old boy and it was the 60s okay I was way sexually active he could have walked into me with a girl he could have certainly could have walked in on me reading pornography he would have laughed that off but to find me reading the Gospel he was furious I mean he was furious he started he's really four-letter words just spilling out of his mouth it's kind of bubbling tar of anger wagging his finger in my faces nose pressed like this close to my nose he said to me if you ever even think of converting I will disown you which and I was like I just want to I just want to know about the culture I just want to know what's in these stories what makes these stories so great so skip ahead a few years I'm in college and you've probably uh all I mean I'm sure they don't teach it here but you've probably all heard of moral relativism in this idea that all cultures are exactly the same there's no such thing as good or evil it's just something that people make up this was just seeping in to university life when I was a kid it was just coming in and it's what they were teaching us and it was kind of a fresh new idea and everybody was grabbing hold of it when I was 19 I read a novel called crime and punishment but I feared or death Dostoyevsky anybody read it okay well yeah one of the towering achievements of Western literature Russian literature but still so not to give not to have too much of it away but I do have to give some of it away this is a story about a poor student named Raskolnikov in Moscow and cute st. Petersburg who comes up with this idea that there's no such thing as a moral law it's just something that people think of and therefore a great man should be able to rise above the moral law in a few years this was going to become popular philosophy with the works of Nietzsche but and EJ hadn't published yet so Gustafson he was kind of a prophet he saw it coming down the pike so Rick Skolnick off decides he is above the moral law and he decides he's in debt to a pawnbroker this female pawnbroker so he decides he's gonna kill her why not so he takes an axe and he kills her and while he's killing her her sister walks in and he chops are up too and he slowly comes to realize that he was wrong that his theory was wrong he has violated the moral law and with the help of a friend who is a prostitute she begins to lead him to Christ and I remember I read this book and I put it down and I covered my face with my hands I thought he's right not about the Christianity part I thought that part was pure mythology I didn't think that didn't touch me at all but what touched me was the idea that there was a moral law seems to me indisputable and once you find that's indisputable you are on your way there's no escaping God from that moment so even though it took me thirty years I was 19 you it took me 30 years to get there that book that novel turned the ship of my life toward God have you ever been into a Christian bookstore my crossways or lifeways or at all you know they all have the same name but go in there one day and say have you got the book about the ax murder and the hooker it wouldn't happen right they would not do it that is not what Christian literature Christian art which was at one point the greatest art mankind has ever produced the music of Bach the Sistine Chapel I would argue Shakespeare as well now it's all this squeaky-clean stuff you know what I think is the best Christian work of the last 20 years The Sopranos The Sopranos is a gangster story it's filled every other words the f-word is filled with nudity and violence and killing and the Spirit of God hovers over this thing almost visibly as these people violate every single moral law there is it's the world it looks like the world so I'll tell you one last story and then wrap it up and just tell you why my life and our culture are related I've lived two lives at least two maybe three now until the age of 28 I was a really dark twisted depressed miserable human being just a sick I was a sick person and since that time I have lived a life of increasing joy I mean it has been a beautiful thing I can barely remember what it was like to be that guy the worst moment of my life came when I must have been about 28 29 when things got so bad I decided I had to kill myself I had a wife same wife I have today who I love then as I love her now I had a little daughter my daughter was about this big I just thought they would be better off without me and I was sitting alone in a dark room drinking whiskey and smoking cigarettes and I was thinking to myself the problem is I don't know how to live I just don't know how to go on feeling the way I feel and so I was thinking about throwing myself off the roof I can't say I would have done it I don't know but I was thinking about it pretty hard in the background I had a radio on and the radio was playing a baseball game a Mets baseball game and there was a player on the Mets named Gary Carter he was the catcher and I loved Carter he was one of those guys who had slide into a brick wall to get the second base I mean he was just one of those absolute you know dirt dirty uniform players but he was a Christian and every time they interviewed him after a game if he hit a home run or something he'd be civil Jesus geez praise Jesus praise Jesus it used to make me he'd used to send that chill up the back of my neck it was like he had pulled an earthworm out of his nose I mean that's what that's the way I reacted to this Jesus Jesus Jesus Gary just stop you know it's just a home run while I'm sitting there thinking I don't know how to live I don't know how to live Carter drives in the winning run with a ground ball that he beat out the face and he had terrible knees because he was a catcher right he's crouching all the time knees were gone but he beat out the throw to first base and that stroke in the winning run and after the game the interviewer came up to him and said how did you do it how do you how do you run when your knees are gone have you run so fast when your knees ago.if at that moment Gary Carter had said oh Jesus Jesus praise Jesus I wouldn't have heard a word he said not a word but all he said was sometimes you have to play in pain and the minute I heard that I thought that's the answer to my question that's how you live sometimes you got a play in pain I can do that I'm a tough guy life is tough I'm tough I can play in pain that was the last time I ever thought of suicide in my life I would like to go back and slap that kid in the head for even thinking about it at all but my life turned around within weeks within weeks everything had changed my life went on a totally different path I thought I was in the hell I was at the end of the tunnel I just didn't see it and here's what I think today I think that God was speaking to me through Gary Carter and sometimes I can't get through the story without breaking down a little bit because it really does move me I think that God was speaking to me through Gary Carter but he knew that if he used his name I wouldn't hear it so I want you to consider this for just a minute the king of heaven and earth set-asides his name the name most high as they say - talk to me schmuck I was thinking of killing himself that kind of humility is how we have to take the culture back if you think about Lord of the Rings one of the great Christian novels of all time nobody has a religion in Lord of the Rings nobody prays nobody talk I don't have the word God is in Lord of the Rings maybe I don't know I don't remember it's such a big book I can't think about george RR martin game of thrones he's an atheist everybody has a religion in Game of Thrones because he's always tearing at religion one of the reasons his themes don't make any sense is because he doesn't have God but he has a resurrection you know so it doesn't actually make any sense but but he's attacking God so he always is showing people worshiping talking doesn't have to do that because he is talking about fact that God is interwoven into the truth of the world here is the moment we are at ok and it makes me very optimistic our atheist friends who are running the culture have ceased to make sense that's what happens when you pull the bottom block out of the jungle our it falls down right they are talking utter nonsense when they say to you there's no such thing as right and wrong therefore if you judge another culture you're wrong well if there's no such thing as right or wrong why shouldn't I judge another culture you say well you have to respect every culture well my culture is the culture that doesn't respect your culture you have to respect my culture not respecting your culture I'm not making any sense they sit around and they say men and women are completely the same the internal life of a man and the control life of a woman lately the same you know I think okay I've lived a long time that's not the way it looks to me but you know great believe what you want but then they say oh you know I'm I'm a woman in a man's body you say well if there's no difference how do you know how do you know yes if men and women are exactly the same what would it be like to be a woman in a man's body would just be like being a man in a man's body you know they're just the same they're not making any sense almost everything they say doesn't make any sense our response to sell them a squeaky clean Jesus Jesus Jesus message is not gonna get anywhere Jesus God is God of the real world is not God of Candyland he speaks in the lives of bad guys and he speaks through the lives of bad guys he speaks when people are doing the worst possible things and the arts are about the dramatic terrible things that humans do all we have to do to win this battle is speak the truth the simple truth not about Jesus about life about what life is like I read scientists now they say there's no free will does anybody live as if there's no free will they tell me there's no self I'll always love that one the guy sits and says there's no self and I go like you know who is saying that to me what do you what are you talking about it they say they say the self is an illusion I get to whom to whom everybody knows the truths of Christianity or true everybody knows it every single person knows that he is not a piece of meat everyone knows that he may say it it may sound good in philosophy class but he knows it's not true every single person knows that the logic of the world is not the moral logic of life everybody knows it people die for things that are higher that have higher value for life and you wouldn't do that if life was all there was all we have to do is speak the truth and we will win because we make sense and they don't and I just think this is a tremendous moment when the culture is open to everybody because the movie companies have lost control and the publishing companies of lost control is all online and we're all talking to each other all we have to do is speak the truth and the truth will set us free thank you very much for coming now don't ask hard questions up for some questions right now so if you guys have a question in mind go ahead and please line up right here along this walkway and then when I call you up if you could just come up here and give me your name what you're studying and then your question for Andrew and and by the way I'm happy to talk about politics too but I wanted to talk about what they asked me to talk about so why more form right here my parents told me it wasn't fine not to go to school here back here well first I drove five hours from Las Vegas to get here Oh Mike no not a lot of culture there go don't applaud for that you just encourage them that's it just to get away from my wife and kid of course also your daughter says hi I don't know why she has to relay that through Twitter to me my question is you talked a lot about about religious culture and I think that in in terms of that culture war we do have a chance but in terms of pop culture I hate to say it a different way but we're not cool we're just not cool on TV we're not cool in the movies you know it's like in in grade school when the cool kids were deciding what could and what couldn't be said that's that's still what's going on except now they're tenured professors and CNN news anchors so what can we do in terms of like I think we have good content but the rapping something is going is going wrong with the presentation and I know I'm asking this of a guy who who titled a book werewolf cop but you know but so what can we do in terms of that and also what does seem to be cool is this pseudo intellectualism so how can we combat that and how can we also kind of be cool in the pop culture right a great question first you got to stop trying nobody's cool if they try that's the first thing but the other thing is this when you look at the history of the arts and this is something I've studied and thought about my whole life different arts rise up at different times right now it's a golden age of television you know you can turn on television see some actual great works when I was a kid novels were a big thing now they're not you know movies in the 30s I mean you go back and look at 1939 almost every great movie was made in 1939 art forms rise at certain times because of what you just said because the elite kids the cool kids do not make any sense that's why I do satire I didn't start out as a satirist but I do satire because they're hilarious I mean you really don't have to write it you just report it you just report what they're saying anytime you make people laugh you're cool I mean anytime you can make and they're just buffoons they're knuckleheads and so you can just make people laugh by making fun of what's going on I mean look I think good you know the the good adventure stories are great obviously the superheroes are a big deal I'm not a big superhero fan but that's a big deal there's a lot of really interesting stuff being done in science fiction now because technology is increasing to a point where our humanity is threatened and so that creates these kind of Philip dick situations of what happens if they implant the false memory in you what happens when they can actually turn a man into a woman then what happens you know what happens if they transport you to another place but you're still in this place there's all kinds of stories to be told that can be answered through a spiritual perspective and you just have to find the what the way to speak it really is you just have to find the way to speak but it cannot be it cannot be that the cool kids are going to talk crap forever and get away with it that's not what's going to happen how's it going I'm Zane Courtney and I'm actually a film major here at GCU that's not funny enough and so as a as a content creator as a guy who you know maybe wants to go to Hollywood or New York or someone like that to be a Christian influence for these people you know what does a guy like me have to bring to the table so that we're not just these Jesus Jesus kind of people right right to be able to to relay and to actually expose the kingdom of God as it exists on earth right so what would you say to a content creator who really wants to be that light in a in a in a realistic way what well first of all I think that you cannot be one of the problems that insurgent movements have whether it's conservatism which is now kind of that cool is now a conservative kind of the rebels you know or Christian Christians trying to move in one of the problems that insurgent movements have is a kind of secret hope that the people that they're trying to kill will love them so we call it being John McCain's you know if when when you secretly are hoping that the New York Times will love you for pointing out that the New York Times is the worst paper on earth right but but you're secretly hoping they'll do a feature about you you know the movie business which I've worked in extensively at this point it is pretty much as bad as you think it is and it's incredibly hard to get into and everybody wants to do it so when you go in and say oh and I'm a Christian conservative you're done right you're toast however however you notice they don't censor movies they censor YouTube why because YouTube is the culture Twitter is the culture there are all kinds of ways now that people can make culture without going through the mainstream and so what I would say to you is forget the mainstream you know build a culture you know i weirdly I have been on the cutting edge of all these things I did a nap with a movie in it right and the app every three days the next chapter of the movie would show up in your phone there's a ghost story called haunting Melissa and your phone would go and every time it happened I go like ah you know it's terrifying yeah I mean that stuff takes money but there are people willing to give the money and some of it doesn't take money you know ultimately I hate to say this because it's such a cliche but if you build it they will come they the the movie business is dead the movie business is virtually a charity at this point TV is dying for content if they see something good on YouTube they will come after you you know hi my name is Ryan faux broken sign business marketing here at GCU and something that I find extraordinarily important is to keep our culture and this idea of Americanism and to extent as you were saying that Christendom is a motherhood of the West and so my question to you is how do we ensure that we can pass this along to future generations and they will continue to fight for these ideals that has built our society do you think that this will continue in the future or are we going to be me in my opinion more like Europe where they fall into leftist doctrine and where their God is the state the Europe is dead as far as I'm concerned I think I know I I do I think Europe is I think Europe has been dead since 1945 I basically think it's just we're watching the body being consumed I mean what you know Europe was the greatest culture mankind ever produced you know and I think that they are dead and and it's really interesting I read all these academic intellectual books and again and again I mean I could I could rattle off names of books you know nobody's ever heard of but I could rattle off names of them in which in every one of them they say they're talking about the death of your boy this one is called the strange death of Europe and he says obviously what's missing is Christianity but I just can't believe it I just can't believe it it's the intellectuals right they can't believe it they can't grasp the miracles they can't get the whole I what you know what is this whole thing with you know people rising from the dead that doesn't happen that's you know I always say that atheists and believers both have the same basic thought this stuff doesn't happen just have different reactions to that but but this is this is the problem we're facing the problem we're facing is with the elites okay it's not with the common people if you go out and look at you know upper-class people they go to church now you know there used to be the idea was that the poor dumb folk go to church that's not true it's the people who are successful who go to church and that's going to be really important upcoming but the intellectuals of the guys were missing and I believe that there's a there that as we're speaking as we're sitting here there is a revival going on among the elites and that they are starting to come around and I know this because I know some of them and they and the people who are your age or gathering together like the ancient Christians and they're starting to talk about what all this means and how we can go forward and how we can believe again and that's why I'm really optimistic about it but I do think that they are the ones who are most put off by that old-time religion and I like that old-time religion but I think it is the thing that puts off the intellectuals our age I don't want to go on forever but our age is very much like the age of the French Revolution we had a revolution in the 60s it failed but the waves of thought have continued to go on at the end of the 18th century there was a movement called the Oxford movement where people in Oxford started to rediscover Christianity I think that's happening now I think it's gonna happen again so I'm I'm very hopeful it was a was that your question whether it yeah America and I'm very I'm very hopeful that the foundation is going to come back and the we can build on that again thank you sir hi mr. Clavin first off thanks for coming it's a kind of starstruck to see you here and at my school my name is Ezekiel I am a biology and sciences major inspiring physical therapist soon to be first generation college graduate to deviate a little bit from the culture and arts and the topics as a biomedical science major we come across kind of certain bio ethical dilemmas and problems and major public policy and things like that I wanted to get your opinion do you think health care is a right or should it be presented as a privilege I think it's commodity I don't think it's it's either I mean I think that it is a something that we sell to people and it always there is no time because it's a bottomless come out of it commodity there is no time at which everybody is going to get the same health care rich people are going to get better health care than poor people that's just going to happen I do believe we have reached the point where there is a base level of health care that people should get but as we go forward and at you know your generation is gonna live for a long time you know as we go forward there are always going to be disparities and I think what we should always be thinking about is how to keep people free because once you say that I'm paying for your health care then it's up to me whether you smoke or not once I say I'm paying for your birth control it's up to me what you do with your sex life and so we want people to stay free and the best way for people to stay free is the free market when a TV new TV comes out it costs thousands of dollars within a year it costs $100 you know $600 whatever it's affordable because of capitalism because of the free market every time the government gets in the way of the free market prices go up I think what we should be designing is a way of selling healthcare as a commodity in the free market so who stays affordable for everybody and those who can't have it at all will get help from the state mr. Clavin thanks for coming out my name is also Andrew good name so my question it kind of revolves around media so I'm a marketing major here at GCU and I've worked an intern with a number of different agencies that specialize in television social media all that kind of digital marketing but also traditional print as well and based on my experience and what I've seen across the entire industry is there's a very biased liberal agenda within the media and some for someone who's conservative and ultimately to like within within an agency your goal is to please the client and to produce good content but for clients that I've worked for before who want these extreme liberal kind of ideologies some of which have been Super Bowl commercials or whether it like we're even like a pamphlet that they hand out at an event how how can I use my Christianity but also my conservatism to kind of change some clients like it's a weird question but how do I change clients Minds you know it's like because you know like I said you're you're there to fulfill their goals so yeah I mean I'm not sure you can I'm against the short answer I think that when you you know everybody has to do his job and your job is to produce their content what you can do is you can show that they can reach more people with a different message you can help them do their commercial job better by showing them with facts and figures that there is a big audience that they're not reaching I mean I've been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood now like what I go in and say to him is I can talk to people you don't know I can tell stories that people want to hear that you've never met you know so if you go to them and say hey here's a client base that you can reach with a different message that may work you know that may work but you can't change their minds because they up believe what they believe yeah hello oh lord Clavin a simple lord of the multiverse will do so after the firing of Kevin Williamson from the Atlantic it was kind of a big shock to conservatives who thought we could get into these leftist atmospheres easily and clearly it isn't so and you obviously like you said you've been kicked out of Hollywood studios and stuff like that so my question is sort of more so in terms of jobs like if someone was in Kevin Williamson position should conservatives volunteer to be the quote/unquote token conservative in these leftist circles or should we stay out of that basically the the only way that I would ever do it this is the only way I can answer the only way that I would ever do it is with a rock-solid guarantee that they would let me say what I have to say that they would keep me on there and let me say what I had to say and not fire me for at least a year because I know Kevin is not the only guy I know who's been in this situation they invite him in because he's anti Trump and they think oh we can live with that but Kevin is a conservative guy with very outspoken opinions and once the pressure comes once the heat comes they chicken out it was a terribly cowardly thing to do and a mean thing to do to hire a guy away from his job and then fire him for being who you always knew he was a Rasta thought yes yes these guys are being the New York Times must have taken the kool-aid and put it and somehow made it part of the atmosphere I do not know they don't have to drink the kool-aid at the New York Times they just breathe the kool-aid at the New York Times Bret Stevens was an intelligent anti-trump at an intelligent conservative columnist at The Wall Street Journal he's now talking about repealing the Second Amendment Ross Douthat was a devout Catholic who wrote brilliantly on religion he's now like babbling about all you know all kinds of how how he was against Kevin what he was talking about Kevin Williamson is extremist you know it is just look you hang out those are your friends those are your employers the pressure is on you don't want to insult people you don't want to go to work and have people throw rocks at you so you change you know if you want to keep your integrity if you want to say what you're gonna say you either go to a venue that will let you say it or you better be ready to go into the crucible mr. Clavin thank you for coming out once again a pleasure thanks all right so I'm my name is Caleb and I study psychology here so my question is about mental health it seems that just a about every problem including liberalism in this society comes from a mental health crisis what do you believe we can do as a society as Christians with popular culture or with the government to address this growing crisis it is a growing crisis I mean the streets of LA are now just littered with homeless people most of whom I'm sure are mentally ill our mental health facility is falling apart they closed the institution's which I understand we're not great but there's now nowhere to go there's no way you know a lot of insurance doesn't cover it is a tremendous tremendous problem and we need to address it I have a problem with the pathologizing of every possible thing that goes wrong you know in other words if you're shy you now have social discomfort disorder and you need to be drugged you know and I think that the two things that I would like to see happening I would like to see the drug companies curtailed in in selling drugs to people who have normal problems like in other words if you're in grief you're not depressed you don't need an antidepressant that is pure that is capitalism going wrong and as far as I'm concerned that's the one thing and the other thing is I believe we need places to put people who cannot function in the society it's not pleasant it's not nice but we got to get them off the street it's a nightmare yeah does that answer your question there's yeah my name is Connor rice I'm studying government here first I just I really want to thank you about that um I start with your dad that story with your dad finding you a butt with a Bible in your bedroom yeah I grew up in a household where I was inoculated against religion the way that you know most parents inoculate their kids against smallpox yeah they want to keep it away from me though is this thing where my mom always worked that way always saying you know you don't do the right thing because you want to get into heaven you do the right thing because you want to do the right thing and the accusation was that if I was doing something for God or for Christianity or because I believe in Christ it wasn't because I have love or compassion in my heart but because I just wanted reward right I wanted I want I how can I prove that I'm not selfish yeah that means she's got it exactly wrong you exercise to get healthy and you live well to be well you know you live well to have life in abundance you follow Christ have life in abundance and so all you are saying is that the line the moral line goes beyond life and so you are living into that line now what I was talking about before is so is she she also is living into that line she also believes things that don't make sense if life just ends right if life decisions you would never do anything for anybody there would be no reason to do anything for anybody why why would you do it it's that you are living a life that extends past life that you are that you have a broader broader moral sense than the immediate pleasure of the moment and so it is just just in the same way that you live a certain life so that you will be a healthy person not I don't try to be a healthy person so I'll live a long time I try to be a healthy person for right now this moment you know and you know I have a long speech I give about this which I don't have time to give now but all the joy in life all the joy in life is by following virtue all the joy in life is by following the right thing if if my life were miserable I would not do what I do on the promise of a future life I do it because it gives me joy right this second it makes my life beautiful right this second and that's a really good reason to do something you know all right we got time for just a couple more questions before you come up I'm gonna actually take a question from the other room we actually have a overflow room just a little store set up and we have a question coming over from the next door all right so this question is from the overflow room and it's from Tori and she asks the film major earlier asked how to bring Christianity back into the movie culture but why do you think Christianity abandoned its beauty and rich art and literature for squeaky-clean bookstores and cheesy movies yeah you know this philosopher Schopenhauer said that it became banal optimism he calls it the Christianity has sunk into banal optimism you know somehow Christianity has lost its sense of tragedy which is kind of a joke for a religion founded on a crucified God you know it lost the sense that things are hard they're sad the world is sad you know I mean you can't be joyful until you know the world is sad you will not be happy until you understand that life is tragic you know that is that is the great understanding that was why Christianity created such tremendous art because it understood that it understood that if God and all his goodness came down to heaven people would crucify him once you understand that you get it you get the world that you're living and you stop saying things like how can I be more successful in the world you get it you understand somehow I think that Christianity lost its sense of tragedy and possibly that was because of its success one of the things about America was it was a place where you could be a Christian without getting killed for it and I think maybe it made people lazy made people think that everything goes great you know everything goes great with Jesus and it's just not true and once you believe that you can trip make art anymore because art is about real life I think it may just be that Christianity has was so successful in creating a culture that tolerated it that it accepted it that it lost its sense of tragedy and reality I'm mr. Clavin thank you for being here my name is Carter and I have a lighter question I love film and specifically the crime genre so I was wondering what are your top three favorite crime films and why well I mean the Maltese Falcon may be the greatest crime film ever made and I think it's because it sort of establishes the genre establishes the rules the final scene which is right it's almost word-for-word from the book is one of the greatest scenes in in movies I'm trying I mean so many of the great crime films were old and I don't want to give you three really old ones but I do like we're trying to think of a modern one so many of the other the ones I loved were the old ones but I love the Chinatown is a great throwback to those old stories it gets better every time I watch it I didn't like it the first time I saw it but it gets better every time I watch it and I'm sure that I'm sure the minute you sit down I'm going to think of about seven others that I love and I love the Big Sleep which is also you know another Bogart film but that's another great great movie if you've never seen just a little one it's kind of offbeat the bank job is really good it's just a recent cool little movie all right we just got time for one more question right now hey thanks for coming out mr. Clavin my name is Trey I'm studying physical therapy here my question is what's the best part about working for Ben Shapiro and what's the worst part about working for Ben Shapiro I always say I'd like Ben more than Ben likes men you know I'm happily I am a contract I because I'm a novelist I've always kept away from you actually being employed by anybody so I'm just an independent contractor I've always really liked Ben I've always really gotten along with them I sometimes say that I don't know if you ever see The Godfather remembers the scene with a machine guns sunny out in the toll booth when Ben disagrees with you that it feels a little bit like that because he talks about machine but he's been absolutely great I really really I I mean I've always we have always gotten along we frequently disagree and when I told him that I was voting for Donald Trump it was sunny for three hours I mean he he went after me for like three hours but but he's he's a terrific guy to be around and he's really you know he's incredibly smart but luckily I'm older and Wilier than he is so I can know it really I was saying this before a to Connor you know working at the Daily wire has been one of the truly great work experiences of my life they are everybody there as a close friend I mean if I sound like I'm being bland that's why everybody there's a close friend they are my Christian community they're the people I sit around talk theology with they are you know people I can rely on and it's just been it has been a weirdly blissful experience sorry not to be able to dish more dirt on that all right thank you so much all right let's sink Andrew Clavin one more time for coming out all right that concludes the event thanks thank you everyone
