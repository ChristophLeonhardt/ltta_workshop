>> COURSES WHEN PETER STRZOK
MAY OR MAY NOT TESTIFY AS WELL.
MOLLY, THANK YOU.
>> LET'S CONTINUE THE
CONVERSATION.
WE REACTION TO THE IG REPORT.
WILL BRING IN OUR FAIR AND
BALANCED PANEL.
WE HAVE A STAFF WRITER AT THE
FEDERALIST AND THE DEMOCRATIC
STRATEGIST, ANTOINE.
I WILL START WITH YOU.
SURPRISED OR DID THIS NEAR WHAT
YOU ALREADY THOUGHT?
>> I THINK THERE ARE FOUR
THINGS THAT MOST REASONABLE
PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN FROM THE IG
REPORT.
NUMBER ONE, THE FBI WAS RIGHT
NOT TO CHARGE FAIRLY.
BECAUSE OF THE EMAIL SCENARIO.
NUMBER TWO, THERE WAS NO
POLITICAL BIAS FOR THEIR
DECISION TO DO SO.
NUMBER THREE, JAMES COMEY MAKES
A VERY CRITICAL MISTAKES AND
NUMBER FOUR, THOSE MISTAKES AND
OF HELPING DONALD TRUMP IN THE
END.NOW, THE REPUBLICANS WILL
PUT THEIR SPIN AND SAY THAT
THAT WE USE THE SEVEN WORDS
FROM THAT TEXT MESSAGE, NO, WE
WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN.
USE THAT AS A WAY TO POUR COLD
WATER ON THE ROBERT MUELLER
INVESTIGATION.
BUT THE DEVIL IS IN THE
DETAILS.AND THOSE DETAILS IN
A 500 PAGE REPORT ARE THOSE
FOUR THINGS I MENTIONED.>> I
WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION
BECAUSE ANTOINE HAS THE FOUR
POINTS.
AND I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION
ON THE FIRST TWO OF THEM BEFORE
WE GET TO THE NEXT FEW.
THE FBI WAS RIGHT AND NO
POLITICAL BIAS.
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?
I ASSUME YOU FEEL PRETTY
PASSIONATELY OTHERWISE.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE
ESSENTIALLY HR DEPARTMENT FOR
THE FBI.
AND IT IS IN THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL REPORTS OWN INTEREST IN
ORDER TO CORRECT THE FBI AND GO
ON A BETTER PATH.
THOSE SORT OF THINGS, NOT
CHASTISING TOO GREATLY.
I THINK THAT IS
I THINK THAT DE
I THINK THAT DEFINITELY WHAT WE
SAW
THW
THROUGHOUT THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL REPORT.
I THINK IT CONFIRMS A LOT OF
PEOPLES SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE
FBI THAT IT IS RUN BY A BUNCH
OF IDIOTS AND NAEGELE MADE HE
-- MEGALOMANIACS.
IT ENDED UP HELPING DONALD
TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST
IDIOTS AND TOTALLY BOTCHED THIS
THROUGHOUT THIS.
I ALSO THINK THAT IT REALLY
TAKES A SWIPE AT JAMES COMEY
AND HIS PERSONAL CREDIBILITY.
I THINK THE LARGER CONSPIRACY
THEORY WE ARE GETTING FROM THE
LEFT THAT DONALD TRUMP COLLUDED
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IN ORDER TO
STEAL THE ELECTION AWAY FROM
HILLARY CLINTON, THAT WAS
LARGELY DEPENDED ON THE
CREDIBILITY OF JAMES COMEY.
>> I DON'T GET PAID TO DISAGREE
WITH YOU THIS IS WHAT ANTOINE
IS FOR.
THAT AND THE SECOND PIECE OF
THE ARGUMENT AS WELL.
>> I APPRECIATE YOU BEING FAIR
AND BALANCED BUT I KNOW THE
REPUBLICANS WANT TO RUN THAT
THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER BUT
THE RUSH INVESTIGATION AND THE
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION ARE
TWO SEPARATE THINGS.
IT IS FUNNY THAT ME AND MY
FRIEND ON THE RIGHT TALK ABOUT
THE FBI AND THE AGENCY BEING
BASICALLY STUPID WHEN
REPUBLICAN PARTY SAID THEY ARE
A PARTY OF LAW AND ORDER.
SOUNDS VERY HYPOCRITICAL COMING
FROM THE EXTREME RIGHT.
>> ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT, YOU
TALKED ABOUT JAMES COMEY AND HE
DID HAVE AN OP-ED IN THE NEW
YORK TIMES.
AND I WANT TO BRING ANTOINE
BECAUSE HE SAID HE DID DISAGREE
WITH THE IG FINDINGS BUT IT DID
NOT SOUND LIKE HE TOOK BACK HIS
DECISION.
ANTOINE, I WANTED TO RESPOND TO
THAT AND THEN I WILL GET YOUR
TAKE, BRE PAYTON.
>> I'M NOT A FAN OF JAMES
COMEY.
IN MY OPINION I THINK HE CAUSED
HILLARY CLINTON ELECTION.
BUT IT IS FUNNY TO HAVE THE
REPUBLICANS BEAT UP ON HIM WHEN
BEFORE ALL THIS, HE WAS LIKE
THE ANGEL CHILD OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
HE WAS THEIR GUY.
NOW THIS HAPPENED AND ALL OF A
SUDDEN HE IS A BAD GUY.
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER TWO
WEEKS AGO WHEN THE DEMOCRATS
LOVED JAMES COMEY AND THEY ALL
SAID HE WAS THE LAST HONEST BOY
SCOUT IN WASHINGTON D.C.. I
HAVE TO HAVE BEEN ON THIS
CHANNEL -- I HAVE HEARD THAT
FROM A LOT OF LIBERALS AND A
LOT OF DEMOCRATS WHO I'VE HAD
TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS
LOT OF DEMOCRATS WHO I'VE HAD
TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS AND
SAY I HAVE BEEN SAYING FROM THE
START, WAS JAMES COMEY MADE THE
ANNOUNCEMENT IN OCTOBER 2016, I
SAID HE WAS AN IDIOT THEN.
EVEN THOUGH IT HURT HILLARY
CLINTON.I STILL THOUGHT IT
WAS A BAD MOVE.
I STILL THOUGHT HE WAS AN
IDIOT.
I THINK IT DEMONSTRATE THE FBI
NEEDS A LOT OF HELP AND TO
REVIEW HIRING PRACTICES.
>> I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD
BECAUSE IN THE INTEREST OF
TIME, EVEN THOUGH THE IG REPORT
AND THE ROBERT MUELLER
INVESTIGATION ARE TWO TOTALLY
DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE ARE
CONSTANTLY REMINDING --
>> TO BE CLEAR!
>> WE ARE THE PRESIDENT SAM
FRIDAY HE WAS EXONERATED AND
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS.
THAT BEING SAID, IS THERE
IMPACT FROM THE IG REPORT ON
THE INVESTIGATION?
MEANING, IS IT GETTING IMPACTED
BY THIS IG REPORT WHETHER IT BE
PERCEPTION OR IN ANY WAY?
I WILL START
PERCEPTION OR IN ANY WAY?
I WILL START WITH YOU, BRE.
>> IT IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE
FROM THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL
INVESTIGATION.
HOWEVER, IN THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL REPORT ITSELF, PETER
STRZOK, THE REASON WHY HE DID
NOT COME FORWARD, THE REASON
THEY DID NOT GET A WARRANT TO
SEARCH ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP
WAS BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS
THEY WERE PRIORITIZING ABOUT
HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS WAS
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND WHETHER OR
NOT THERE WERE TIES TO RUSSIAN
OFFICIALS.
WHILE THEY ARE
OFFICIALS.
WHILE THEY ARE SEPARATE
INVESTIGATIONS, THEY ARE BEING
HANDLED BY THE SAME PEOPLE.
A LOT OF THE SAME PEOPLE THAT
WORKED ON BOTH OF THE PROBES,
EXPRESSED A LOT OF POLITICAL
BIAS AND POLITICAL OPINIONS
ABOUT NOT LIKING DONALD TRUMP
AND LIKING HILLARY CLINTON.
IN TEXT MESSAGES AND OFTEN
CONFLATED AND IN THE SAME
CONVERSATION, THEY WOULD SAY
THEIR POLITICAL OPINIONS AND
SEEMINGLY IN THE SAME BREATH
SAY, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING
TO DO ABOUT BOTH OF THESE
INVESTIGATIONS.
YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THEY ARE
SEPARATE AND THERE IS OVERLAP.
I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE
APPEAR.
>> ANTOINE YOU GET THE LAST
WORD.
>> THERE IS A BIG CHANCE AT ALL
OF US HAVE A POLITICAL THEME.
AND THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS, THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
THIS, THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES
IT RELEVANT IS THAT THE RIGHT
WING AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD
TRY TO PUSH THESE TOGETHER TO
MAKE THE CASE TO PULLED COLD
