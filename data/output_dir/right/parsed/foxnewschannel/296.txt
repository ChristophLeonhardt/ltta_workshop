EVACUATION ORDERS ARE IN PLACE.
JILLIAN:  JANICE, HAVE YOU SEEN
ANY NEW INFORMATION?
>> THE NEW INFORMATION IS THE
STORM IS STRENGTHENING,
CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN AS WE
GET CLOSER TO LANDFALL SOMETIME
THIS AFTERNOON.
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THE
PANHANDLE OF FLORIDA HAS NEVER,
EVER EXPERIENCED A STORM LIKE
THIS IN THEIR HISTORY.
WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT
CATASTROPHIC LIFE-THREATENING
DAMAGE, STORM SURGE, AND
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS IN EXCESS
OF 140 MILES PER HOUR FLOOR A
DURATION OF SEVERAL HOURS.
SO THE LATEST UPDATE AS OF
5:00 A.M., IT IS STRENGTHENING.
IT COULD STRENGTHEN EVEN MORE AS
WE GET INTO THE NEXT COUPLE
HOURS AS WE APPROACH LANDFALL.
THE STORM IN THE TEXTBOOKS IS A
PERFECT LOOKING HURRICANE.
ALL FOUR QUADRANTS HAVE FILLED
OUT.
WE'VE GOT A WELL-DEFINED EYES. E
WE'VE GOT A WELL-DEFINED EYES. .
THEY'RE ALREADY SEEING WIND
GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 35 MILES PER
HOUR ALONG THE COAST, 33 IN
APALACHACOLA.
WE'RE EXPECTING A LANDFALL
BETWEEN 1:00 AND 3:00, YET TO BE
DETERMINED, BUT THE STRENGTH OF
THE STORM IS GOING TO BE
UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY OF IT.
STORM SURGE IS GOING TO BE
AN ISSUE.
TAMPA BAY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 3
TO 4 FEET, BUT AS WE GET UP
NORTHWARD TO HORSESHOE BAY, FISH
CREEK, SAINT MARKS, WE COULD
HAVE A STORM SURGE UP TO
14 FEET, THAT IS ABOVE YOUR
HOMES IN SOME CASES.
THAT IS GOING TO BE
EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS.
THE STORM SURGE, THE WATER PUSH
IS WHAT KILLS THE MOST PEOPLE IN
THESE HURRICANES.
FLOODING IS GOING TO BE A BIG
CONCERN, 4 TO 8 INCHES, ISOLATED
AMOUNTS OF 12 INCHES PLUS.
THIS IS GOING TO MOVE NORTH AND
EASTWARD AND COULD AFFECT AREAS
IMPACTED BY HURRICANE FLORENCE.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
