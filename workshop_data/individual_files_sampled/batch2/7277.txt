fighting and citing religious liberty in order to prevent a marijuana legalization ballot initiative on the November ballot so they don't even want the people of Utah to have the ability to vote on whether or not they should legalize recreational not recreational medicinal marijuana this isn't even recreational so this is a group of Mormons specifically of course Mormons are the bigger religious group in the state of Utah to make their case the group is citing the Supreme Court decision in masterpiece cake shop versus Colorado Civil Rights Commission which allowed a Colorado Baker to refuse to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple due to a religious objection this is the group's second lawsuit to keep the proposal off the ballot this November the person leading this is Walter plum the third and you will hear his case in the next video it's not just the LDS Church's any religion I don't think anyone is in favor of smoking whole plant marijuana in apartments who is I am a Christian and I'm against this I'm against marijuana I'm against whole plant marijuana I'm not against the extracts such as CBD oil that may help people just say two quick things one is I'm for the whole plant I'm a whole planter I mean nobody would want to smoke marijuana apart except everybody I mean that guy is against democracy right he's against democracy because you don't even want the non Mormon non-religious people of Utah to have a say in this you don't want anyone to vote on this you don't want it on the ballot period and this is again medicinal marijuana and by the way I don't care if it's medicinal marijuana here if it's recreational marijuana I'm care if it's heroin okay if the people of Utah wanna vote on it and they want it on the ballot they should be able to vote on it that's what a democracy is okay and by the way you're a Mormon you don't like the whole plant you don't like whatever act extract you like some extracts do you boo you don't need to be deciding for everyone else what they can and can't do it's none of your goddamn business yeah yeah I mean the claims that they make are just I leaves with so many questions 130 states have already approved medicinal marijuana so if that's the case then Mormons wouldn't live in any of those 30 states that again doesn't make sense and he says that Mormons or you know their cases that mind-altering drugs shouldn't be allowed to be used there better not be any oxy up in that state by the way more Missourians coffee right Kenny but who is a drink coffee in their apartment is coke illegal in Utah is Pepsi illegal in Utah so I don't understand the basis of argumentation around this and in just like you were saying Anna if they're so afraid and they're opposing even putting the bill on the ballot then it is likely gonna go through and that's what they're really afraid of I'm not shocked because one of the backers to oppose the ballot is the Utah Medical Association because there's there's probably money to be made there's no medicinal and marijuana here it's I I don't understand I mean where does it say no marijuana in the Bible actually Cypress Hill is famous for quoting a Bible verse saying that you should use all the plants yeah there god bible quotes or you did people use to back it in the King James Version in Genesis 1:12 the plant called hemp is proper for Christians to use for food medicine and enjoyment enjoyment who are you to argue with God right all right so let's two more things about this one this is not like the Baker case the Baker says and I don't agree with him either but he says I I don't want to serve a bake a cake for a gay couple now by the way a transgendered person I like has it they're messing with him has come in and said now I want a cake I want to cake that's blue on the outside and pink on the inside to celebrate my transition right is it go oh no this guy's the most famous Baker who won't bake anything and anyway so now that's going to court but this one in Utah is not like that he's not saying I won't smoke marijuana that would be perfectly fine that's Hays free country right he's not saying I won't sell you marijuana that would be like the Baker right he's saying no one should be allowed to even vote on this issue because I object right what and you objected what grounds well my particular religion doesn't like it so no one should be allowed to have it then go live in a theocracy so one quick note that I wanted to make was that he's arguing well there are Mormons who own apartment buildings and maybe they don't want their tenants to smoke marijuana in their apartments right well that's called tuff Nuggets right you don't get to decide what someone can and can't do inside that apartment right now they can't destroy the property obviously you can go after them for something like that but what are you gonna do are you gonna like if someone likes butt sex you're gonna like knock on their door and be like I don't like butt sex how are they that's again if I related don't more butts acts like it's unacceptable I mean so this guy they they believe in theocracy so much they're running into every nitty-gritty of your life and judge you judge you know I do marijuana you're not allowed to have the wrong kinds of sex etc and by the way if he gets his way then Muslims would actually get to have a pre-emptive ban all across the country because they could say look I'm against bacon so if you're gonna cook bacon I'm allowed to throw you out of my out of your apartment you're a Christian well thank you mister Mormon you just me the right to discriminate against all Christians because I'm against pork now I'm pretty sure you don't want to set that precedent right I mean this is the irony of it all which is that most of these groups especially conservative groups will argue that they want the government out of their lives but to replace them with religion doesn't seem like an adequate like transfer of freedom exactly exactly yeah look it's called a democracy so try it for a change it's a ballot initiative let the people of Utah decide not just you random dude too easy wasteful
