in June the University of Alberta shamefully gave an honorary degree to the anti oil extremist David Suzuki what disgrace but now the Alberta Teachers Association wants to top that they have invited a paid for an anti oil and anti pipeline lobbyist named sapore Berman to speak to their teachers conference next month as their honored guest speaker here's the story about it in the Calgary Herald that says the teachers conference will be held in the Aboriginal town of Enoch Alberta as in this is a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between Alberta's Aboriginal community and the oil patch which is outrageous and it's racist the oil sands are the largest employer of Aboriginal people in Canada for this foreign lobbyists to jet in from Vancouver to slander the industry to turn teachers into propagandists to try to brainwash young aboriginals against their own interests against their own province against their own economic feature that is outrageous that is racist and it shows that the Alberta Teachers Association uses classrooms to push their political views on children seriously let me show you just a handful of clips from support berman so you can see what an extremist she is little corrodes where we can reinvent the ground those are clips from berman going back years but you only have to go back days she is one of those leading the charge against the trans mountain pipeline expansion she is still trying to kill the keystone XL pipeline she gloated when the northern gateway pipeline and the energy East pipeline were stopped there's really no other way to put this she hates the oil and gas industry it is a hatred oh and she's also paid to hate it paid by her former a foreign lobbyist bosses she used to work for Greenpeace International now she works for another anti oil lobby group based in the United States but she doesn't criticize us oil strangely enough and she certainly doesn't criticize Oh conflict oil from places like Iran or Saudi Arabia she's never campaign against them just against Canada but the Alberta Teachers Association loves that about her they think her ideas are legitimate let me quote from the Calgary Herald story Berman does have a legitimate perspective that is shared by people both in Alberta and more broadly said ata spokesman Jonathan Tate Meyer in an interview Saturday I'm sorry killing Alberta jobs is not a legitimate point of view not one that should be pushed on teachers to then push on students what's so gross here is that every single teacher in Alberta is forced by law to join this extremist anti or patch Union and every single teacher in Alberta is forced by law to pay union dues to them to cover berman speaking fee and other costs are there any teachers in Alberta who oppose this extremist anti Alberta anti-oil speaker or maybe they're just afraid to speak up in case they're teachers union bosses punish them well that's where we come in I want to get a petition of 50,000 Albertans and other Canadians who love Alberta to demand of the Alberta Teachers Association stop Berman from coming to this event to poison the minds of young students especially Aboriginal students please sign the petition and we will personally deliver it to the Alberta Teachers Association in advance of their meeting go to stop Berman dot CA that stop BER ma NCA and while we're at it let's do something positive you know there are 2388 schools in Alberta I checked between the public schools and the Catholic schools and the private schools and there's actually 62 First Nation schools for Aboriginal kids I want to send those school libraries a copy of my own best-selling book called ethical oil the case for Canada's oil sense it was a huge bestseller and it really helped rebut a lot of the lies told by people like sapore Berman yesterday I wrote to my publisher asking if we could get a special order a discounted price for 2388 paperback copies and look and how deep a discount we could get for that the book retails for 1995 but I bet we could get it for half price or maybe even less obviously I'd waive my royalty of a dollar a book so hopefully we could buy a book for every single library in every single school in Alberta I think about twenty thousand dollars would cover that I bet sapore Berman speaking fee cost twenty thousand dollars and she just tells anti oil sands lies do you think that's the right approach a massive petition that stopped Berman dot CA telling the teachers you need to disinvite that hater but also a positive strategy sending a copy of ethical oil to every library in every school in the province if you agree with these ideas please go to stop Berman CA sign the petition and help us tell these kids especially Aboriginal kids if the oil sense is the best thing that's happened Alberta no matter what some foreign-funded hater says please go to stop Berman dot see a sign the petition and help chip in to send an ethical oil book to every school in Alberta please go to stop Berman dot CA we've got to stop this anti oil hater from poisoning our kids
