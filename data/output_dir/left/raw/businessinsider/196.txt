1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
- I am here with Richard
Sherman, cornerback

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,160
for the Seattle Seahawks,
long time crypto-enthusiast,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,170
and the spokesperson for COBINHOOD.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,003
- Yes.
- Thank you so much

5
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:08,836
for joining me.

6
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:09,669
- Thank you very much for having me.

7
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:11,431
- So can you explain to
me what COBINHOOD is?

8
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:13,740
- COBINHOOD is a trading platform.

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,380
Like many others out there,

10
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,670
but it has no trading fee,

11
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,300
which for most people that'll
save them a ton of money.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,880
For me, it's saved me a ton of money

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,550
and I'm thankful for it
because you get frustrated,

14
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,190
you feel like you're
tradin', you're having a heck

15
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,510
of a day, and then you look up

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,140
and every transaction you've got a fee,

17
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,180
every trade you got a fee,
every trade you got a fee,

18
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,210
and it's like,

19
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,870
you know what, it would be way
better if I could do all this

20
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,410
and save my money on these fees.

21
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,790
So, I'm thankful for Popo,
their founder, who came up

22
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,623
with COBINHOOD.

23
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,540
He's incredibly adept at
understanding blockchains

24
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,190
and crypto and that whole world, you know.

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,116
I mean, when I speak to him
I feel like a small fish

26
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:58,440
in a very, very, very big pond,

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,208
but I'm trying.

28
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,260
- And how does that business model work?

29
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,650
How do they make money
if they don't charge

30
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,640
any transaction fee?

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,660
- Well they do a great job
underwriting for companies

32
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,720
that are trying to create a coin, ICO,

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,960
or also marketing these
companies and making sure

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,370
that they're seen and that,
you know, their coin is getting

35
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,660
as much exposure as others.

36
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,980
So they make their money
that way, so they, that's

37
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,520
how they save on these fees.

38
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,050
- And this is not the first crypto project

39
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,070
that you've been a part of,
or interest that you've had.

40
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,080
How did you first get involved
and when did that happen?

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,040
- Well honestly, and I
hate tellin' this story

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,090
because it's frustrating.

43
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,460
So I have like a merchandise
website, you know,

44
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,990
shirts and sweaters and things like that

45
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,580
for people who wanna support.

46
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,920
And, early on, I mean maybe
like five, six years ago,

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,130
some of the fans were
reaching out like, oh man,

48
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,990
we wanna pay in bitcoin, we wanna pay

49
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,700
in this digital currency.

50
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,920
And, I was kinda skeptical obviously.

51
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,364
It's like, just normal cash will do.

52
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:58,199
(laughs)

53
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,390
I mean, you know.

54
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:05,750
But one of our managers
for the website was,

55
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,530
from Asia and he had heard
of cryptocurrency and bitcoin

56
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,610
so he was more informed than I was.

57
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,300
He was like, yeah just
go for it, just allow it.

58
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,480
I think you're gonna really like this.

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,540
I think it's a future.

60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,050
And so we allowed it,
for the most part though,

61
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,110
we just converted it back
to cash unfortunately.

62
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,250
Yeah, so, if I could go
back in time and not convert

63
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,040
that to cash, then sure I'd
have a lot of bitcoin probably.

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,140
Millions of dollars.

65
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,020
- But is that regret
what got you interested

66
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,975
and starting to research
bitcoin and get involved

67
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:41,808
in the cryptocurrency?

68
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:44,570
- I mean, and not really
regret, just kinda,

69
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,810
like I missed out.

70
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,810
You know, like I passed on the opportunity

71
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,960
where I could've done more research,

72
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,610
I could've really looked into it.

73
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,400
But I got into it.

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,490
I've made some money.

75
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,010
I've made $15,000 on it, but
it could've been a lot more.

76
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,830
- What other cryptocurrencies
have you looked at

77
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,544
other than bitcoin?

78
00:03:03,544 --> 00:03:05,580
- I'm into ethereum and other coins

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,130
that come with that blockchain.

80
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,100
Obviously I've got a few
bitcoin, like goin' out dabbling

81
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,560
as I've learned more.

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,780
And is it true you told your
grandmother not to buy bitcoin?

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,300
- Yeah because with that
situation, I'm tryin' to explain it

84
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,240
to her, you know, and I'm
like, yeah it's blockchain

85
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,640
and ethereum is the
ledger for the blockchain

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
and, you know, as I'm
explaining it she's just like,

87
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,420
you know, just blank-faced like,

88
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,780
okay so how do I make money?

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,700
I'm like well, if the
cost of the coin goes up,

90
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,500
and she's like, what
happens if it goes down?

91
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,020
Then you lose money.

92
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,720
She's like, no, I don't wanna
lose money, so make me money.

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm like grandma you're
not really listening.

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
You just don't mess with it.

95
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,360
Ima figure out,

96
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,360
let me figure out more on it.

97
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,840
Let me figure out how it
works more, but, you know,

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,240
sometimes, teaching a person who is,

99
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,520
stuck in their ways about
something new is very difficult so

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
I advised her against that.

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
- And would you, do you still convert all

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,600
of your merchandise sales that are made

103
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,560
in bitcoin directly to cash?

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
- No, no we don't do it anymore.

105
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,720
- You
hold the bitcoin now.

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
- We'll hold the bitcoin now.

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,480
- Would you be willing to
take your salary in bitcoin?

108
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,920
- I would be, as long as
it equaled out to about

109
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,280
the same amount, you
know, I'd take it in bitcoin.

110
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,680
It'd be hard for them to tax
it which is always appreciated.

111
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,480
Hey, give it to me in bitcoin guys.

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
I don't know how to tax it.

113
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,920
It's not cash, so.

114
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,760
- Where do you think the
bitcoin price should be?

115
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
- That I don't know.

116
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,840
I loved it when it was at $19,000.

117
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,280
It was awesome.

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,360
If it would like to go to
$100,000 that'd be fine with me,

119
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,160
I wouldn't mind that, at all.

120
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
- Great, thank you so much.

121
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,101
(laughs)

122
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,070
- What about you?

123
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,310
- Me, I have no idea, I have no idea.

124
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,160
- Because it seems to
fluctuate, I wish I knew

125
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,390
what was controlling the price.

126
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,650
When it, you know, they say,

127
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,060
the different factors that effect it,

128
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,622
but it just seems to be middling now

129
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:28,540
and going back and forth
above 10, right below 10,

130
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,070
above 10, right below 10.

131
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,810
- Yeah, it's hard to find any real thing

132
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,840
to peg the value to.

133
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,090
- Right.

134
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,284
- Great, well thank you so much,

135
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:36,220
for sure.
- Thank you for having me.

136
00:05:36,220 --> 00:00:00,000
I appreciate it.
