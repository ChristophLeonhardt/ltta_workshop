NASHVILLE.

6
00:00:09,832 --> 00:00:10,833
THE TENNESSEE U.S. SENATE RACE

7
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,434
FIGURES TO BE CRUCIAL AND BOTH

8
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,036
PARTIES AT FIRST ARE TRYING TO

9
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:15,904
CONTROL THE U.S. SENATE AFTER

10
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:17,940
THIS YEAR.

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,774
CORRESPONDENT STEVE HARRIGAN IS

12
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:22,044
IN NASHVILLE TONIGHT.

13
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,712
>> Reporter: AT THE MOST

14
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:25,881
EXPENSIVE RACE IN TENNESSEE

15
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:27,283
HISTORY COULD CONTROL THE U.S.

16
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:27,616
SENATE.

17
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,885
>> IT WILL BE HIGHLY

18
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:30,753
COMPETITIVE, LOTS OF MONEY FROM

19
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:32,688
THE OUTSIDE POURED INTO THIS

20
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:33,089
RACE.

21
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:35,624
IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE THE

22
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:39,228
PIVOT THAT TURNS ON WHETHER THE

23
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:39,895
DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE SENATE

24
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:40,796
DEMOCRATS ON.

25
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:43,599
>> Reporter: MARTHA BLACKBURN

26
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:47,403
CARRIES A PISTOL IN HER PURSE

27
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:49,906
AND PROCLAIMS SUPPORT FOR

28
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:50,473
PRESIDENT TRUMP OFTEN.

29
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:52,441
>> I STAND WHEN HE WALKS INTO

30
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:52,842
THE ONE.

31
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:57,046
AND YES, I STAND WHEN I HEAR OF

32
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:57,714
"THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER."

33
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:59,182
>> Reporter: THE DEMOCRAT,

34
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:01,250
FORMER GOVERNOR PHIL BROADUS AND

35
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,285
CALLS HIMSELF A PROBLEM SOLVER

36
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:04,220
AND IT REALLY MEANT MENTIONS THE

37
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,056
PRESIDENT AT ALL.

38
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:09,259
>> THE LESS HE HAS TO TAKE ON

39
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,426
NATIONAL POLITICS, THE BETTER

40
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:10,793
FOR HIM.

41
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:12,862
THE MORE HE CAN KEEP IT LOCAL

42
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:13,696
AND STATEWIDE ISSUES I THINK

43
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:16,032
THAT PORTENDS BETTER FOR HIM

44
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
COME NOVEMBER.

45
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,934
>> Reporter: IT IS A BALANCING

46
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:21,471
ACT FOR A DEMOCRAT AND IT IN THE

47
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:23,406
STATE TRUMP WON BY MORE THAN 20

48
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:23,740
POINTS.

49
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,443
>> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

50
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:27,677
ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES BUT HE’S

51
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:30,046
DOING OKAY.

52
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,214
>> Reporter: BLACKBURN KNOWS

53
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:32,149
SHE’S IN FOR A FIGHT.

54
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:34,417
>> I THINK IT’S CLOSE BECAUSE MY

55
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:35,652
OPPONENT DID SERVE AS GOVERNOR

56
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:38,422
FOR TWO TERMS AND HE HAS RUN

57
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:39,322
STATEWIDE THREE TIMES, THIS

58
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,158
WOULD BE HIS FOURTH, STATEWIDE

59
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:41,458
RACE.

60
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,194
AND PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH HIS

61
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:44,628
NAME.

62
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:45,429
>> Reporter: AND WHAT IS

63
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:48,265
LIKELY TO BE A TIGHT RACE, IS

64
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:51,201
EXPECTED TO DO WELL IN THE

65
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:51,535
CITIES.

66
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:52,503
THEY WILL BOTH BATTLE FOR THE

67
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:53,604
RURAL VOTE.

68
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:55,072
>> AND THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

69
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,673
BE IN THERE TO DO SOMETHING TO

70
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:59,443
HELP MAKE HIS AGENDA TO GET

71
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:03,847
AMERICA BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN.

72
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:04,615
>> Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP

73
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:06,216
WON SOME COUNTIES IN TENNESSEE

74
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,851
WITH ALMOST 90% OF THE VOTE.

75
00:02:07,851 --> 00:00:00,000
THE QUESTION NOW FOR THE SENATE
