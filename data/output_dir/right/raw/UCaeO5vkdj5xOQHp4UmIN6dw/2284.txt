last week we took a look at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,950
possible developments that might occur

<font color="#E5E5E5">if Hillary Clinton is elected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> president</font>

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,660

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,519
might suddenly find yourself on a world

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,889
bereft of every vestige of life except

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,360

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,980
brings the story of mankind to an end

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,050
it's kind of hard to explain today I'd

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,340
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what might be in</font>

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,720

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,170

experience intense internal pressure

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,240

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,439
slow clap ironically in the ensuing

absence of mainstream media coverage

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,369
Democrats will suddenly be forced to

argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the logic morality and</font>

55

efficacy of their policies causing the

highly placed officials suddenly realize

122
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,730
and sometimes I use them on the show and

123
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,710
I'm always a little careful about giving

124
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,540
credit because they might live in Saudi

125
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arabia or Canada or some place where you</font>

126

they'll be carted often and put in

prison but I asked Derek's permission

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,500
and he gave me permission to give him

never wavered in their view that a

robust system of treaty alliances such

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,950
as NATO are critical for defending the

international liberal order or that the

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,760
US should dissuade far away allies such

as South Korea and Saudi Arabia from

he's saying what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great thing WikiLeaks</font>

is and so on and finally culture

goodbye folks all of this seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

234
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,350
fair especially the free trade and this

235
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,080
and the culture and civility thing

236
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,550
immigration could be argued that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

237
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,810
situation has gotten so far out of

238
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,460
control that Reagan is now out of date

239
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,760
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think on trade and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> culture and</font>

240
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,880
civility Donald Trump certainly is far

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,740
away from the principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font>

242
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,360
still work and should be conservative

243
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,480
principles now because too far party

244
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,030
system let's look at the Democrats<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

245
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,530
because there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories today</font>

246
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,270
that you will not hear about elsewhere

247
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,100
that you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have missed that I think</font>

248
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,470
are really important first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

249

Obama himself was present he was there

with this guy and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is discussing</font>

264
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">a dirty trick that they played on the</font>

265
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,740
Trump people where they sent out people

Donald

268
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,500
Trump wasn't putting out his taxes so

269
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,080
the idea was Donald is ducking his taxes

270
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,610
so where did they get the idea from

271
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,560
Donald Duck here he explains it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

272

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,700
candidate and he sent letters that

324
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,790
looked like muskie had insulted Canada

325
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,920
he called them Canucks so they were

326
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,480

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,390
tricks it was something they all learned

345
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,800
in college and they did together and

346
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,390
they sent me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jail and there's a scene</font>

347
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,830
in the movie All the President's Men

348
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,030
where Woodward and Bernstein you're

349
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,100

356
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">O'Keefe if he doesn't wind up shooting</font>

357
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,820
himself four times in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back of the</font>

358
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,770
head you know I mean but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if not but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

361
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,190
so when we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how far the</font>

362
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,990
Republican Party has<font color="#E5E5E5"> strayed from its</font>

363
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,060
principles let's remember how far all of

364
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">us have strayed from the idea of what we</font>

365
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,620
expect from government let alone you

366
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">know going after grabbing women or</font>

367
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,420
attacking women these people are messing

368
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">with our political system and these</font>

369
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,950
dirty tricks they're probably that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

370
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,080
borderline a question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Hillary</font>

371
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,209
Clinton is interacting with

372
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,679
if the Hillary Clinton campaign is

373
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,230
interacting with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> super PACs it's</font>

374
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,179
questionable whether it's legal or not

375
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,069
but it's certainly something that when

376
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">segreti did it we were all shocked and</font>

377
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,639
this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible thing so let's not</font>

378
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget you know this is what I keep</font>

379
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,149
saying about Donald Trump we can all see

380
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">what he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we can't see what Hilary</font>

381
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:28,230
is because it's all disguised and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

382
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,360
they have normalized the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats have</font>

383
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,189
