with days to go before the g7 summit in Canada the economic alliance is fractured the allies are angry and openly talking about a possible trade war we we think this action is inappropriate we think it's absurd to consider Canada security risk of the United States and therefore we've taken a targeted and considered approach to retaliation France's foreign minister also says unless the u.s. reverses its new tariffs on steel and aluminum from Europe Canada and Mexico a trade war is just a few days away at a meeting ahead of this week's g7 summit in Canada US Treasury Secretary Stephen minuchin tried to assuage the Allies President Trump has been very clear and wanting to address trade issues I don't think in any way the u.s. is abandoning its leadership in the global economy quite the contrary and I think we have very broad objectives that that are across a rebalancing the the the trade relationship and the trade deficit but he could not offer the one thing u.s. allies want tariff relief Trump briefed by minuchin is not backing down taking to Twitter on Saturday he wrote when you're almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade you can't lose a trade war many economists disagree they say everyone loses in a trade war because a vicious cycle of tariffs makes goods more expensive all around now some US companies say they fear a trade conflict could end the global economic expansion the upcoming g7 meeting was expected to celebrate our estimates at this point and these are very rough but we would expect another ten to fifteen percent drop we're also suffering because of the steel tariffs which was the genesis of all this everything we do involves steel our fencing everything else is steel related so we're seeing increased prices from those things too so it is kind of a domino thing European leaders who have already chosen their targets for retaliation iconic American products like harley-davidson motorcycles Levi's jeans Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida oranges the next casualties in what could be an escalating conflict John hendren al-jazeera Washington
