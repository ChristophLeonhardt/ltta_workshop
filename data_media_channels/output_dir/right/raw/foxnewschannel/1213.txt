THIS FAR.

THE UNITED NATIONS, THE FIRST

TIME THE ISSUE OF NORTH KOREA

19
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:37,581
WAS ALLOWED TO GET TO THE

20
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:39,683
SECURITY COUNCIL WAS IN 2006.

21
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:42,586
NOW WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF A

22
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,053
HISTORIC SUMMIT.

23
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:45,122

24
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:47,157
WERE FOLLOWING NORTH KOREA

00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:47,858
AFFAIRS.

26
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,194
IN 2006, THINGS LOOKED PRETTY

27
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:50,494
GRIM.

28
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:54,231
HEAVY SANCTIONS WERE WANTED.

CHINA BLOCKED ANY ATTEMPT TO DO

30
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:56,100
SOMETHING.

31
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,167
THE UNITED STATES HELD THE PEN

ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT IT WAS

37

DOING.

38
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,644

WAS IT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS?

HIS WORDS?

43
00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:15,152
HE WAS SO BLUNT AT THE U.N. IN

44
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:16,320
SEPTEMBER WHEN HE DIRECTLY

45
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,688
ADDRESSED WHO HE CALLED ROCKET

MAN IN FRONT OF THE STUNNED

47
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:23,660
AUDIENCE THAT BASICALLY GASPED,

00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,062
INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATS THAT

49
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,765
NEVER HEARD THIS TYPE OF TALK

50
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:28,098
BEFORE.

51

THERE'S A WORD ZEITGIST, THE

53

SPIRIT OF THE TIME.

54
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:37,674
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE ABLE TO

55
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:39,109
DEVELOP THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO

56
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:40,811
SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT STARTED TO

57
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:41,745
ACTUALLY CONCERN THE CHINESE TO

58
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:43,247
A LEVEL THAT THEY THOUGHT YOU

59
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:45,149
KNOW WHAT, WE CAN'T PLAY THIS

60
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,683
GAME ANYMORE OF CAT AND MOUSE

61
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:48,886
WITH THE UNITED STATES USING OUR

00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:50,320
PROXY, NORTH KOREA ANYMORE, WE

63
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,321
HAVE TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT

64
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,623
WITH OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR

65
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:54,024
BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL.

66
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:55,893
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE AN

67
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:56,894
ECONOMIC PRESSURE THAT'S COME TO

68
00:01:56,894 --> 00:02:00,430
BEAR OF COURSE WITH THESE VERY

69
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,332
STRINGENT RESOLUTIONS,

70

ECONOMY OF NORTH KOREA, PULLING

72
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:05,169
THE CHINESE TOGETHER.

73
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,804
THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON.

74
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:11,141
YOU ALSO HAD THE LEVEL OF

75
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:11,875
DIPLOMACY HAPPENING BETWEEN THE

76
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,277
NORTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE

77
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:15,779
THAT HAD ALSO STARTED TO GET A

00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,414
LITTLE OUT OF SHAPE IN WHICH YOU

79
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:18,615
HAD DIFFERENCES OF OPINION.

80
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:20,417
SO ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS

81
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,218
COME INTO PLAY.

82
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:24,188
BUT MOSTLY IT IS THIS HEAVY DUTY

83
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:26,690
CAMPAIGN OF PRESSURE, MAXIMUM

84
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,624
