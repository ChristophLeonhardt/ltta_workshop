so just ask yourself you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander-in-chief Donald Trump can't even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign he loses his cool at the slightest provocation when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter when he's challenged in a debate when he sees a protester at a rally imagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with no player weapons
