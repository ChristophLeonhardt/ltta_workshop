THURSDAY.

2
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:02,577
JOHN ROBERTS HAS MORE FROM THE

3
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:03,044
WEST WING.

4
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:09,684
>> GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE OF

5
00:00:09,685 --> 00:00:10,585
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S OP-ED.

6
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,487
THE WHITE HOUSE ATTEMPT TO WIN

7
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:13,588
OVER ENOUGH SENATORS TO GET IT

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,589
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

9
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,224
I SPOKE WITH A SOURCE IN THE

10
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,158
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE VOTE

11
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:20,762
THAT JUST TOOK PLACE TO SAY

12
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:21,329
WHAT ABOUT MURCOWSKI.

13
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,765
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET HER

14
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:24,065
BACK?

15
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,067
I WAS TOLD NO, THEY PROBABLY

16
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,169
WON'T BE ABLE TO CONVINCE

17
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,038
MURCOWSKI TO VOTE FOR JUDGE

18
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,906
KAVANAUGH AFTER VOTING NO FOR

19
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:32,507
THE CLOTURE VOTE.

20
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,976
THEY DO THINK THEY WILL BE ABLE

21
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:37,045
TO HANG ONTO JOE MANCHIN AND

22
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:38,213
BELIEVE THAT HE WILL -- HE IS

23
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:40,315
IN A TIGHT RACE IN WEST

24
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:41,716
VIRGINIA THOUGH HE LEADS BY

25
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:42,417
NINE POINTS.

26
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,052
THEY BELIEVE THAT MANCHIN WILL

27
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:45,220
VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

28
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:47,088
THEY ALSO THINK THAT FLAKE AND

29
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,592
COLLINS ARE ON BOARD AS WELL.

30
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,694

FOR THE WEDDING OF HIS DAUGHTER

33
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:58,700
THAT MEANS THEY HAVE 50 VOTES.

34
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:01,469
THEY COULD GO 50-49.

35
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,670
IT GIVES THEM A WIN.

36
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,973
IF THEY NEED TO BRING SENATOR

37
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:06,474
DAINES BACK AND KEEP THE VOTE

38
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,476
OPEN THEY'LL DO THAT AS WELL.

39
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,078
PART OF THE CONCERN WITH

40
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,081
KAVANAUGH OVER THE LAST SEVEN

41
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:15,183
DAYS HAS BEEN HIS TEMPERAMENT

42
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,285
AND TONE DURING THAT HEARING

43
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:17,752
LAST WEEK.

44
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:18,686
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TRIED TO

45
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:20,355

STREET JOURNAL" OP-ED THAT YOU

47
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:23,625
MENTIONED OFF THE TOP WHICH YOU

48
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,194
SAID MY TESTIMONY REFLECTED MY

49
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:27,095
OVERWHELMING FRUSTRATION AT

50
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,029
BEING WRONGLY ACCUSED.

51
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,430
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL

52
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,399
AT TIMES AND I SAID A FEW

53
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,167
THINGS I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID.

54
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:34,335
I HOPE EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND

55
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:37,305
I WAS THERE AS A SON, HUSBAND

56
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:37,872
AND DAD.

57
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:39,040
GOING FORWARD YOU CAN COUNT ON

58
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,909
ME TO BE THE SAME KIND OF JUDGE

59
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,945

00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:47,715
HARD WORKING, EVEN KEELED,

62
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:48,983
INDEPENDENT AND DEDICATED TO

63
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,018
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE PUBLIC

64
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:50,318
GOOD.

65
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,755
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS

66
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:55,123
HELPED SENATOR COLLINS AND

67
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:56,090
SENATOR FLAKE BE MORE

68
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:57,225
