SO BUCKLE UP, TIME FOR OUR BREAKING NEWS D.C. SWAMP OPENING MONOLOGUE. ♪ ♪ IT IS SIMPLE, THERE'S A BATTLE BETWEEN THOSE CORE PRINCIPLES OF THIS COUNTRY AND THOSE WHO ONLY VALUE TO POLITICAL VICTORIES. NOW FROM DE LA ONE REPUBLICANS HAVE TREATED THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH WITH THE SERIOUSNESS IT DESERVES. DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE NOT. THEY'VE CREATED CHAOS AT JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S HEARINGS, INTERRUPTING AS YOU SAW DOZENS OF TIMES. THERE WERE CONSTANT OUTBURSTS FROM LEFT-WING PROTESTERS, DISRUPTING THE PROCEEDINGS AND MUCH MORE. NOW JUST DAYS AWAY FROM A FORMAL VOTE AFTER ALL THE HEARINGS WERE OVER AND SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN DROPS A BOMBSHELL. AN ALLEGATION FROM A WOMAN ACCUSING JUDGE KAVANAUGH OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, GOING BACK 36 YEARS WHEN THEY WERE BOTH IN HIGH SCHOOL. NOW FEINSTEIN KNEW ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS SINCE JULY AND SHE KEPT THEM SECRET. SHE KEPT THEM SECRET WHEN SHE QUESTIONED KAVANAUGH PUBLICLY AND FEINSTEIN USED AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TO DISRUPT HIS NOMINATION. THEY HAVE TAKEN THESE ACCUSATIONS SERIOUSLY, AS THEY SHOULD. THERE IS STILL A CHANCE THAT WE NOW HAVE NEWS THAT FORD MAY NOT APPEAR. APPARENTLY FORT HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT FEMALE ATTORNEY HIRED TO QUESTION BOTH FORD AND KAVANAUGH. REPUBLICANS ARE CLEARLY TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER AS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING TO ACCOMMODATE PROFESSOR FORD. EITHER WAY, A VOTE ON KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR THIS FRIDAY. JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN BEGGING FOR A CHANCE TO CLEAR HIS NAME UNDER OATH SINCE THE CHARGES FIRST BECAME PUBLIC. HE HAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THESE ALLEGATIONS OVER AND OVER AND VIRTUALLY NO EVIDENCE IS BACKING UP PROFESSOR FORD'S 36-YEAR-OLD CLAIM. THE FOUR WITNESSES PROFESSOR FORD LISTED TO CORROBORATE HER STORY, ALL OF THEM, DENIED WHAT SHE IS ALLEGING, ALL FOUR. NOW MANY ON THE LEFT ARE DEMEANING THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATE FORD'S ALLEGATIONS THAT NO CONFIRMATION VOTE SHOULD TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE FBI WEIGHS IN. REMEMBER, THEY KNEW THIS BACK IN JULY. TONIGHT THEY SHOULD TAKE ADVICE. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS, OF CRAZY UNCLE JOE BIDEN. SO WHAT HE SAID BACK IN 1991. THE NEXT PERSON THAT REFERS TO AN FBI REPORTER AS BEING WORTH ANYTHING OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE REACH A CONCLUSION. PERIOD. Tucker: THAT DEMEANS THE DEMOCRATS, DUE PROCESS AND PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE LITERALLY MEAN NOTHING TO THEM. ESPECIALLY DELAWARE SENATOR CHRIS COATES. HE ACTUALLY THINKS THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE, I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. TO JUST DISENGAGE, IT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHO IS SEEKING A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT AND WHO I THINK NOW BEARS THE BURDEN OF DISPROVING THESE ALLEGATIONS RATHER THAN DR. FORD AND MR. RAMIREZ. THAT'S SAD. SENATOR, REMIND ME OF THIS NEXT TIME YOU TALK TO HIM. DEMOCRATS WANT A CHEAP POLITICAL VICTORY AT ALL COSTS, EVEN IF THAT MEANS THROWING INALIENABLE RIGHTS RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW. SMEARING, SLANDER, DISBURSEMENT. THE SENATE SHOULD RELY ON TWO CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS, AND WE ARE OKAY WITH NOT KNOWING WE MIGHT PUT SOMEONE THAT IS LIKE THAT ON THE SENATE. ANYONE WHO COMES FORWARD AT THIS POINT AND IS PREPARED TO TESTIFY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THAT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF COURAGE. NOT ONLY DO WOMEN THAT DR. DR. FORD BRIEFLY COMES FORWARD AND SHOULD BE HEARD, THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED. I HAVE TO SAY TO THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY, JUST SHUT UP AND SET UP. I BELIEVE DR. FORD, I BELIEVE THE SURVIVOR HERE. THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE HER. SHE HAS COME FORWARD COURAGEOUSLY AND BRAVELY. I BELIEVE HER AND I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD BE BULLIED INTO THE SCENARIO WHERE IT'S HE SAID, SHE SAID IT, IT'S A SHAM HEARING. I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN IT. I BELIEVE PROFESSOR FORD, I THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE AND I THINK WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS FINISHED, AND WHEN SHE TESTIFIES, AND WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH TESTIFIES, I THINK A MAJORITY OF SENATORS WILL FIND Tucker: Sean: MEN Tucker: Sean: MES Tucker: Sean: MEU Tucker: Sean: MET Tucker: Sean: MEU HER CREDIBLE. Tucker: Sean: ME? I BELIEVE THAT MEANS NO DUE PROCESS OR PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ALSO FACING AN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION, A TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED CLAIM FROM A WOMAN NAMED DEBORAH RAMIREZ. SHE TOLD THE NEW YORK CURE IN THE 1980s, 34 YEARS AGO KAVANAUGH EXPOSED HIMSELF AT A DRUNKEN COLLEGE PARTY. AND GET THIS, RAMIREZ HERSELF ISN'T EVEN TOTALLY SURE THAT KAVANAUGH WAS A PERPETRATOR. SHE SAID SHE BECAME "QUICKLY INEBRIATED" AT THE PARTY. SHE TOLD THE NEW YORKER, SHE WAS A "FOGGY AND SLURRING HER WORDS." SHE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES SHE HAS SIGNIFICANT MEMORY GAPS FROM THAT EVENING. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" EVEN ASKING IF SHE REMEMBERED THE INCIDENT. AND, WITH CONFIDENCE, IF THE INCIDENT EVER OCCURRED WE WOULD HAVE SEEN OR HEARD ABOUT IT, AND WE HAVE NOT. THE BEHAVIOR SHE DESCRIBES WOULD BE COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER FOR BRETT. SHE ALSO THE NEW YORKER INTERVIEWED RAMIREZ'S BEST FRIEND AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AND SHE ALSO IS DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLAIMS. I WAS NEVER TOLD THIS STORY BY HER OR ANYONE ELSE. IT NEVER CAME UP, I DIDN'T SEE IT, AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES" COULDN'T CORROBORATE THE STORY IN ANY WAY. THEY REFUSED TO PUBLISHED THE CLAIMS AS PART OF HER REPORTING AND SAID SHE SPENT WEEKS FINDING ONE PERSON TO CORROBORATE IT. CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY WILL NOT BE CALLING MR. RAMIREZ TO TESTIFY. STILL DESPITE THE LACK OF EVIDENCE, THE LEFT OF COURSE RUSHING TO JUDGMENT AS THEY HAVE IN SO MANY PRIOR OCCASIONS, SMEARING JUDGE KAVANAUGH, NOT EVEN WANTING TO HEAR HIS SIDE OF IT. AND RUSHING TO JUDGMENT AND SAYING, I BELIEVE ONE PERSON. THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR ANYONE IN SOCIETY, WE SHOULD ALL BELIEVE IT WOULD BE POLITICAL. WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BUT MANY DON'T. WATCH THIS. THIS IS A MONUMENTAL DEFINING MOMENT THIS WEEK WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE HIM GOING TO PRISON AND IN THE SAME BREATH, KAVANAUGH POSSIBLY GOING TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. WE WANT AMERICA TO BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY THING HE DID UNTIL WELL INTO HIS COLLEGE YEARS WAS EFFECTIVELY KISS OR WRENCH KISS A WOMAN. IS THAT WHAT HE WANTS AMERICA TO BELIEVE? AND TO BE HONEST THAT'S VERY MUCH A WHITE MALE REPUBLICAN DEFENSE. IF THEY GO THROUGH A SENATE HEARING, AND IT BECOMES A SEAT, CIRCUS, THEY PUSH IT THROUGH AND IT PASSES, THERE WILL BE AS WE SAID LAST WEEK AN ASTERISK THAT IS THERE AS LONG AS HE'S THERE. SO IF NANCY PELOSI, CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS, AND MICHAEL AVENATTI ALL GOING ON TV, AND ACTUALLY THREATENING TO EXPOSE NOW A GANG RATE SCANDAL ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, E IS THE LEAD GUEST ON FAKE NEWS CNN. THEY LOVE MICHAEL AVENATTI. SO JUST TO RECAP, WE HAVE HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS RUSHING TO JUDGMENT. WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA RUSHING TO JUDGMENT. WE'VE HEARD FROM FUTURE DINNER MIKE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MICHAEL AVENATTI, AND, THE LESS ANGRY MOB IS JOINING THE STOP CAVANAUGH MOVEMENT. THE LAST NIGHT, AT THE FAR LEFT ACTIVISTS RAN INTO SENATOR TED CRUZ AND HIS WIFE WHO WAS GOING OUT TO A RESTAURANT IN THE SWAMP WHILE MINDLESSLY CHANTING WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS. WATCH THIS. WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS! Sean: IN THE LAST YEAR, WE PLAYED IT HERE WE'VE HEARD CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS, AND EVEN BARACK OBAMA GET INTO THEIR FACE. FOLLOW THEM INTO GROCERY STORES. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING AND WITNESSING HERE IS A KEY PART OF, WHAT IS THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK? WE SEEN THESE CONFRONTATIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SECRETARY KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, PAM BONDI, MOB MENTALITY, THESE TACTICS HAVE LEFT ARE NOW IN FULL GEAR 42 DAYS OUT OF AN ELECTION. AND SENATOR TED CRUZ 'OPPONENT WAS GIVEN A STATEMENT OVER HIS DUI WHERE HE LITERALLY LEFT THE SCENE OF A DUI ACCIDENT, TWO TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT, BUT DENIED THAT EVER HAPPENED. IF THE LEFT TRULY BELIEVE SURVIVORS, THEY MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DEPUTY CHAIR OF THEIR OWN PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, KEITH ELLISON. HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND HAS ACCUSED HIM OF REPEATED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE, DATING BACK TO JUST A SHORT TIME AGO. HE'S NOW RUNNING TO BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. HE'S THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT THE DNC AND AT A DEBATE LAST WEEK, HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THESE RECENT CLAIMS. TAKE A LOOK. ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL STEP FORWARD? IN THIS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT SOMEBODY MIGHT COOK UP BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOBODY THAT I'M AWARE OF WHO HAS ANY SORT OF WHO IS THREATENING OR SUGGESTING ARE EVER MADE A PRIOR ACCUSATION. Sean: SO MANY OF THESE DEMOCRATS I WON'T GIVE DUE PROCESS TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THEY HAVEN'T UTTERED A WORD ABOUT THEIR NUMBER TWO FOR THEIR PARTY. THEY MAY LEARN MORE. ELLISON HAS YET TO FACE AN ANGRY MOB CHANTING, WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS. THEY HAVE YET TO BE CONVICTED ON TV, AND HE IS ACCUSED OF HAVING FOR CAMPAIGN FUNDS. HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF RATE AND HERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY EARLIER TODAY ON A RADIO PROGRA PROGRAM. AND THE STIPULATION D AND THE STIPULATION P AND THE STIPULATION S AND THE STIPULATION T AND THE STIPULATION O AND THE STIPULATION N AND THE STIPULATION F AND THE STIPULATION O AND THE STIPULATION M AND THE STIPULATION A AND THE STIPULATION D AND THE STIPULATION N I SAID PLEASE READ THIS ACCOUNT AND THE STIPULATION T ONE OF THEM WOULD READ IT? THEY HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN THIS DOUBLE STANDARD ALL THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. EDITS AT THE REST OF THE MEDIA WON'T REPORT ON THIS. TODAY AND TOMORROW, , AND THURSA WE WILL BE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., TODAY AND TOMORROW, , AND THURSY FOR THE UPCOMING HEARING. AND IF PROFESSOR FORD DECIDES TO TELL HER STORY, WE WILL LISTEN. SO WHILE ALL OF THIS IS GOING O ON, THE PRESIDENT, WHO IS IN NEW YORK AT THE TIME AND LITERALLY PUSHING HIS AMERICA FIRST AGENDA MOVING FORWARD WITH HISTORIC SUCCESS, AND TODAY AT THE U.N., HE STOOD UP SOLIDLY FOR AMERICA FIRST. IN FRONT OF THE WORLD STAGE. I THINK ONE OF HIS BEST SPEECHES TO DATE, TAKE A LISTEN. IT'S ALMOST ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AMERICA IS SO TRUE. I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION BUT THAT'S OKAY. AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. THE STOCK MARKET IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN HISTORY AND JOBLESS CLAIMS ARE AT A 50 YEAR LOW. Sean: THAT'S A GREAT SUCCESS FOR THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN THAT CAME OUT TO VOTE IN 2016. ARE YOU GOING TO GO OUT AND VOTE AND KEEP THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS SO THE AGENDA AND SUCCESS CAN CONTINUE? AND, WE DO HAVE RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. HISPANIC AMERICANS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND 65 YEAR LOW FOR WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE IN AMERICA. FOR A MILLION FEWER PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS, 4 MILLION MORE AMERICANS WORKING, BREAKING RECORDS IN THE STOCK MARKET, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE HITTING AN 18 YEAR HIGH, AND IT NOW, A BLUE WAVE. GUESS WHAT, TONIGHT IT MAY NOT BE SO CERTAIN IS THAT MEDIA HAS BEEN PEDDLING TO EVERYBODY. REPUBLICAN FAVORABILITY OUT TODAY HAS NOW HIT A SEVEN YEAR HIGH. AMERICANS LITERALLY SPENT MORE ON TAXES IN THE YEARS 2013 THROUGH 2016 THAN THEY DID ON FOOD AND CLOTHING. BY THE WAY, THE DEMOCRATS WANT THEIR CRIMES BACK. IT'S NO SECRET OF THE PRESIDENT'S SUCCESS. HE DOESN'T GO ON APOLOGY TOUR IS, HE PUTS AMERICA FIRST AND IT WORKS. President Trump: AMERICA WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE INDEPENDENCE AND COOPERATION OVER GLOBAL GOVERNMENTS, CONTROL AND DOMINATION. I ENCOURAGE EVERY DENOMINATION IN THIS ROOM TO PURSUE ITS OWN CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS. THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE OR WORK OR WORSHIP. WE ONLY ASK THAT YOU HONOR OUR SOVEREIGNTY IN RETURN. WE DO NOT ALLOW OUR CITIZENS TO BE VICTIMIZED, OUR WORKERS TO BE CHEATED AND OUR WEALTH TO BE PLUNDERED OR TRANSFERRED. AMERICA WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR PROTECTING ITS CITIZENS AND WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER AMERICA'S SOVEREIGNTY TO AN UNELECTED, UNACCOUNTABLE, GLOBAL BUREAUCRACY. AMERICA IS GOVERNED BY AMERICAN AMERICANS. AND WE REJECT THE IDEOLOGY OF GLOBALISM AND EMBRACE THE DOCTRINE OF PATRIOTISM. AND 42 DAYS YOU GET TO DECIDE IF THIS CONTINUES. THE CLOIS TO MAKE A CHOICE IS NOT CLEAR FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S VERSUS THE PARTY FIRST. THEY FORCE THE PRINCIPALS, LAW AND ORDER. THAT IS VERSUS THE PARTY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, LESS BURDENS OF REGULATIONS, LOWER TAXES, ENERGY AND, 42 DAYS, THEIR LIFE IS
