I have spent from first thing this morning until literally just two minutes ago non-stop I've been on my phone all day I've had people who are serving for our armed forces ringing me and contacted me non-stop people telling me about the morale in the Armed Forces people before going to let me just read this one I sometimes wonder if the top brass who are like politicians who in comparing this one being told as well from the members of the Armed Forces who have never been on the battlefield who are highly educated who are more like politicians than soldiers if they are really that our touch with the feeling of their troops it's like our politicians they're that out of touch with how we think how we work and I think it's just from talking to everyone it's exactly the same in the Armed Forces they have come crushing down on the young recruit a young recruit who's been in this training process who's been getting screamed at as he worked as hard as he can as his and he's probably added as the other lads have just told me he'd have had dark times in that training process where he thinks is this what I want to do as he struggles with his training and he's prepared and was willing to give his life to the Armed Forces and some privileged man at the top has decided that because he shared a selfie he can take all that opportunity all that life that he was gonna lead away from him now whether they are ass down or touch if you can read any comments I'm reading all the comments read the comments from members of the military ex-members of Middlefield I'll read one here Tommy Robinson has more support in the British Army than trees and may be warned if you start to prosecute soldiers for their support of him you will see something happen you cannot control as a former British paratrooper I'm telling you straight we under why you here guys I'm saying in a democracy TR should be allowed to say what he wants to say based on his own experiences none of the soldiers trainee or otherwise are entering some dodgy parallel political force they serve the crown but attacking them because of a picture with a British citizen really now what they're saying is because none of them are back this up I'm actually going on the for a and I've got evidence of this that's a day leading leading members of the military have been briefing all of their soldiers all over the country to tell them that they're not allowed to follow me on Facebook and any of them that want to share my views there's no place for them in the army what are my views no one can tell me the problematic thing is that I say or do that causes this problem this is simply dancing to the tune of a saw imagine there was actually commented this earlier he linked the Muslim Council of Britain and the ones that the British Army had danced in to their tune they're the ones sacrificing this young lad because of their complaints actually in the briefing the the the representative in the army said that they have to keep the Muslim community happy I have to keep the Muslim community happy so this young kid his career is taken away from him to keep the Muslim community happy because of course we can't allow for them to be unhappy now one thing I've taken from today which is actually I think is quite dangerous and it's not good I'm a British citizen and I think that we have to have a strong British Armed Forces with great morale I have been on the phone non-stop here in horror stories of the feeling amongst members of the Armed Forces the feeling not just over this this but this could be the final straw for on that they feel what won't bother I'll actually just tell you exactly what this not just said oh I know that him and all the other lads are watching this so that's how you doing and we'll catch up at some time but I'll just her you might lose your job through so he said that if we went about if we went war again soon then he believes many people would not go to war many of the people who are serving have had enough and that maybe they could send the Silver Spoons leadership who are currently sacrificing this young man and the young men that would be on the frontline maybe they can send them over it's a handshake Mohammed or Abdul on the other side and meet them there actually quote me in his words but that's all I just think that it's a very dangerous situation and a very you want to have a strong armed forces with a strong morale and they're understaffed undermanned treated like shit and now when you mix all that out with the political correctness in the middle of it the British Army are young or have always been predominantly tough working-class English men that's what they've always been that's what they are now now the way they want to paint it no matter why they want to do it we are inclusive diversity and flying rainbow flags from all the military barracks there's always been gay people no one's against gay people being in the army but this massive potion driver LGBT and not just LBGT but transgender all of this within the Armed Forces which is a predominantly as I said a tough straight working-class force of men ready to fight to protect all of us and the morale if you even understand their their recruitment videos and I know he there was a big backlash thing because I received thousands of contacts and email some people who are fed up people actually wanted to leave I actually had some people saying that the Armed Forces wanted to strip their forces again by another ten thousand and the easiest way to do that was their recruitment videos because so many young men were to serve had enough of this now which this properly this incident that's just happened today would add to that but that's that's it I just wanted to I think the more people I'm speaking to in our forces are more and more people are speaking to find now and I just wonder if really this decision just a lot just like the decision to imprison me for giving facts that were already in the public domain that's hugely backfired on the establishment hugely bad fighter I think this decision is going to hugely backfire in the process already and I know that by the contact and the amount of serving soldiers they're constantly contact me one serving soldier today has been fired and kicked off of his barracks because he contacted me you can't fire and kick a mall and sack the mall because I mean literally hundreds and hundreds of contact me today so yeah I just really wonder if you're really grasped in the feeling in amongst your own recruits again good night and there'll be more updates tomorrow we're at a hundred and seven thousand signatures on a petition in less than 24 hours that's huge for petitions as far as petitioners go huge bigger than any most of the petitions that get headline news everywhere so and you've already seen in any way people haven't enough not just in the military across this whole country or sensor everyone on me and everyone I speak to and it all comes down to an agenda just to silence people free speech how can i soldier how can i member of our armed forces not be allowed to take a well I'll ask again which I say what is it I've done what is I've done I've been convicted of no haiquan no racism no extremism ever why is it have done them what this is about is attending to make me because I think they feared the groundswell of support that's grown and the movement there's been bill and I think they fear it in fact I know they fear and this is about making a mere pariah there is untouchable for many because of your jobs they want you to be worried and scared of losing your job so that you'll stay away or won't want to be associated me because most people will now say look what happened to the young recruit he lost his job for being photograph them you can't go near Tommy Robinson he can't show support on others in fact I've got it with evidence which will come out tomorrow that their leaders are telling them now you can't follow him on Facebook you can't fool him now a lot of people going through the the guidelines and within the military that say you're not allowed to be members or clique or political organizations or prescribed public organizations I am NOT a political organization I'm an individual on the journalist who reports news and brings the news to people I'm not an organization I don't see the problem I'm just a citizen a British citizen and in fact if you read if you read I think I went through this earlier if you read the I started going through and having a read on the on the website basically on on the Armed Forces website itself it says that they must show respect to all citizens when in their uniform they must show respect and treat citizens the way they wish they'd wish to be treated that's their duty they have to and now you're on a sack I'm for dinner because you shared itself anyway good night I'm negative I'll give you more updates but as I said we're a hundred and seven thousand signatures that's gonna continue to voice a please continue to share it takes one minute I know many people think I was one of those people were never got petitions as a former then what else don't sign it you see if they realize before the day of they've given a I believe for this lad to be discharged and it's in you ever look if I'm right it's in it's the it's early next week I believe so hopefully they'll see the groundswell of support for him hopefully they'll see in the next coming days a lot of support from within the armed forces for him and understand that they're making a mistake a huge mistake and also the narrative there's been pushed again by the media that's what they do have you seen the narrative of almost saying he has a long disciplinary history a long negev he's a he's a he's just he hasn't been in the military that long I spoke to people today from his regiment who work with him who have said it's bullshit it's noise but then they make it seem that he's got a real negative history so this is the final thing but the truth is they're sacrificing him to please the Muslim Council of Britain you
