I knew it was gonna happen I came all the way from Germany I'm American from Kentucky and I knew I had to be here that was with a thousand pastors that came in to meet Donald Trump in New York early in the year middle in the mid June timeframe and we found him to be a man of peace and a reasonable man and one of the things that I will tell you is that once the african-american community sees that he's not patronizing he's fair he's a man that will it make you can just look at his family I really believe that's the misnomer and I believe you're gonna see in these exit polls that more blacks voted for him then they've been voted for Romney and McCain in past I really believe you're gonna see that I am elated I'm just so ecstatic because I believe that for so long the political class and the media and everybody is trying to tell the American people what they really want and I think tonight the Americans people have spoken the polls have been so wrong how could the pose be so wrong how could they be so wrong and and I think it shows that it's a repudiation for the political correctness in America and I think it's just gonna buck and I think Donald Trump represents the voice of the people and I think that's what this is is a it's a populist movement and I think it's a it's a nationalist movement
