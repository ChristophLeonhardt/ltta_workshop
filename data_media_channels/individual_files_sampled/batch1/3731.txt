so this is the Kinesis advantage pro keyboard it's a super organ ama keyboard it has a lot of cool features I used to not care about ergonomics and then my college roommate got carpal tunnel syndrome and had to get these steel rods through his arm and out his palm which was really scary it's very unhealthy for you to have your wrists up you don't want to do that you want to have them to be down it's I mean even if you do it right now watching this video you can feel the stress right here that's why they put the keys in this these kind of wells on this keyboard you know they recommend you put the pads on your wrists are sort of angled down which is what you want it's just a lot healthier for your for your joints all of the modifier keys are right here under my thumb's basically for the most part like Control Alt all these things instead of a conventional keyboard where you're doing that with your pinkies because then your yourse playing out to the side and that is also a very uncomfortable sort of position I switched from the QWERTY keyboard layout to the Dvorak keyboard layout partially because it's you know it's supposed to reduce finger travel a lot and be better for your hands and your your general health and avoid RSI and stuff like that so if I'm sitting here next to another person with another keyboard anyone in this room could come in here type on this keyboard or another keyboard attached to it and QWERTY and work but I can also I can type with them at the same time in Dvorak and my keyboard is translating the things that I type into it in itself before it even goes to the computer so it's translating my QWERTY keys into our my Dvorak ease into QWERTY for the machine which allows me to work with another person who doesn't use this that's really the critical element of it all
