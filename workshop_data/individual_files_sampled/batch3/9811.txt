"AMERICA'S NEWSROOM," I'M SANDRA SMITH. Bill: HOW ARE YOU HANGING IN THERE? Sandra: DOING ALL RIGHT. HAPPY FRIDAY. Bill: I'M BILL HEMMER. THE MAGAZINE POTENTIALLY PUTTING THE F.B.I. ON ITS HEELS. AS MUCH AS THE BUREAU'S ROUGHLY 14,000 SPECIAL AGENTS MIGHT LIKE TO TUNE OUT THE NEWS, INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REPORTS HAVE FOUND LAPSES THROUGHOUT THE AGENCY. LONG-TIME OBSERVERS LOOKING PAST THE PARTISAN HAZE SEE A TROUBLING PICTURE. SOMETHING IS WRONG AT THE F.B.I. CATHERINE HERRIDGE PICKS IT UP FROM THERE. GOOD MORNING. WHAT DO YOU TAKE FROM THIS PIECE? GOOD MORNING. THE FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR SEEMED TO PLAY DOWN "TIME" MAGAZINE'S ASSESSMENT TELLING CBS NEWS THIS MORNING THE TOUGH DECISIONS HE HAD TO MAKE ON THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION AND COMEY SAID HE STOOD BY HIS DECISIONS BUT WERE INFORMED BUT F.B.I. SENIOR LEADERSHIP. I HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF PAIN OVER A LOT THAT'S GOING ON. OUR BEING STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ELECTION BUT I'M AT PEACE WITH THE DECISIONS WE MADE. I'M ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DECISIONS BUT IT WAS A LARGE GROUP OF TALENTED PEOPLE WHO MADE THOSE. CRITICS POINT TO THE FACT THAT A HALF DOZEN SENIOR F.B.I. EXECUTIVES WHO WORKED UNDER COMEY HAVE SINCE BEEN FIRED, REASSIGNED OR CHOSEN TO RETIRE INCLUDING HIS DEPUTY F.B.I. DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE FIRED FOR LYING TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS ABOUT HIS ROLE IN A MEDIA LEAK ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. F.B.I. AGENT PETER STRZOK AND LAWYER LISA PAGE WERE REMOVED FROM THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AFTER THEIR PERSONAL TEXTS REVEALED BIAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND JAMES BAKER LEFT THE POSITION ALONG WITH HIS FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF. IF YOU ADD THE HEAD OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO THE LIST YOU SEE OVER A HALF DOZEN SENIOR EXECUTIVES WHO HAVE LEFT THE BUREAU SINCE COMEY WAS FIRED. Bill: I'M HEARING THE PRESIDENT TALKING ON THE SOUTH LAWN. WHEN WE GET THAT TAPE ON CAMERA WE'LL PLAY IT BACK FOR OUR VIEWERS. FIRST THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ON THE BUREAU RIGHT NOW AND EXPECTED TO TESTIFY NEXT WEEK ON THE HILL. IS THAT STILL HAPPENING? IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND PEOPLE WHEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL TASKED TO LOOK AT THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION IT WAS VERY BIPARTISAN. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT REPORT WOULD PROBABLY BE READY EARLIER THIS YEAR BUT ALL OF THE DEADLINES OR TIMELINES HAVE SEEMED TO SHIFT. THE BEST DAY WE HAVE ON THE CALENDAR IS FOR NEXT WEEK WHEN HOROWITZ IS SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY BEFORE ONE OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEES. BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT COULD ALSO SHIFT IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE BECAUSE HE HAS CONTINUED TO RECEIVE NEW LEADS HE HAS PURSUED ON THE HANDLING OF THE F.B.I.'S INVESTIGATION INTO THE CLINTON EMAILS AND ALSO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE, BILL.
