the World Economic Forum is underway in Davos with some of the world's biggest players reading for talks at the luxury Swiss resort and this channels deputy editor-in-chief has been taking part in a panel on fake news during the debate the BBC's representative went out of her way to criticise RT and questioned our role as an alternative voice in the media there's no equivalence argument you know the BBC yes you say RT is just a national broadcaster just like the BBC is you know BBC is subjected to do two independent you know a regulator Ofcom Buzard which is nothing to do with the with the government and the BBC regularly makes reports and inves investigations which criticize the government or not II we absolutely do that on RT we are regulated actually by Ofcom as well all of our programming and just as Joe was describing the process less than two B then the BBC I never find like the BBC has so this is but this is this is this is the project they were moving the goalposts we're constantly moving the goalposts something and this is the problem that errors that RT has made and of course we've made errors in our reporting and we've addressed them we've corrected with issued clarifications to inform their audience but when it comes to RT or other alternative voices legitimate alternative voices in the news media those kinds of accusations become a way of just summarily misrepresent the nature of what we do our T's deputy editor-in-chief Anna Belknap believes that despite hostility from certain quarters there is a clear widespread support for alternative voices in the media you could see from the very beginning of the panel just how quickly the participants lost a sort of a common you know a common target of what it is we're supposed to be fighting that the same of journalists or media professionals who are very quick to for instance ridicule or you know pick apart statements by Donald Trump ridicul his deployment of the term fake news as a way of dismissing any kind of reporting that he doesn't like are doing in fact the same thing themselves they are doing it for instance to Artie and completely wrongly and baselessly accusing it of things that our network has never done does not do as a way of silencing an alternative voice in the news media space among the positive sign this was after the debate we didn't get to see that the encouraging thing is how many people from the audience people from a wide range of countries from every part of the world have approached me and told me how refreshing it was to see an alternative voice to carry alternative ways to see an alternative perspective on a stage like a Davos and I think it demonstrates the real me the real demand for voices like our teeth
