here's the thing it's it's a narcissistic foreign policy to Justin Trudeau was surrounded by flatterers and he loves reading about himself posing and selfies but I think to the foreign to other people who aren't in love with him I think he's just like some clotheshorse from a small place it would be like if Belgium elected a young ish I mean Trudeau's 46 he's not that young handsome in Street o's handsome enough but he's it's not a supermodel it's not as young as Emmanuel macron he's not as young is the boss of Austria so he sort of you know he's handsome for a politician let me put it that way if Belgium elected some you know moderately attractive Prime Minister that might be a big hit in Belgium but the rest of the world would say yeah okay sort of who cares and and nothing better illustrates that for me than this clip this is Trudeau walking into a meeting of the g20 so these are the 20 senior leaders prime ministers presidents and and their senior aides and Trudeau's got his fancy socks on and he's carrying like he's just and he's like that kid at a party and he recognizes some people but no one says hey man no one and he just parks near Trump and he fidgets with his digits with his briefcase and he he sees Donald Trump as Donald Trump what do you mean he tries to get his attention and Trump comes over for a second and really quickly tries to get away and Trump sort of passes Trudeau off to some other poor guy and I'm not saying that Trudeau has to be a star I mean I he wouldn't know he couldn't be but what a contrast between how the world's leaders see Trudeau they don't even think of them if they do they might think of him as some clothes horse or something he's not a he's but in Canada our media party just thinks he's the bee's knees well and I think a lot of his foreign policy is about getting attention from the foreign media and turning himself from that sort of ignored weird awkward at the g20 meeting that we just saw to somebody that the the global media will notice for his progressivism I mean for the first year of his his prime ministership he sort of tried to out Barack Obama Barack Obama he started making moves to normalize relations with Iran then he started piling money out of the country to fight climate change and you know three-quarters of a billion dollars to find abortions in the developing world it all seemed like what he was trying to do was be the most progressive politician on the planet and get noticed for it instead of taking care of Canada yeah that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the yeas relevant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
