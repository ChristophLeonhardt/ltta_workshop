hi guys so today I'm going to be showing
off some of my drawing skills I was
challenged to do so and I thought I
would do a funky fish depending on how
funky it is entirely up to you so first
of all you need to start off with doing
a why like so and then you join it up in
a circle like so give it a triangle for
a tail and we do this quickly for 60
seconds teeth in a zigzag big eyes nice
eyebrows because you have to fish do our
eyebrows and like that and give the top
give it in the water and bubbles pop at
the top and that is 60 second September
a funky fish good critical horrible
