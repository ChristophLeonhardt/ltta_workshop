the guy to negotiate with and in the in the administration was the vice president not the president the president's like every kid we knew in every class along the way who was thought he was the smartest guy in the room and needed to share that with you on a frequent basis I know the president's a smart guy but I always thought it was a waste of time for him to try to describe what I felt in my presence it was a grading an irritating characteristic which is why they did the guy to negotiate with and in the administration was the vice president not the president really effective leaders are good listeners and when I've been around the president he's not particularly interested in listening he's more interested in pointing out his point of view why don't you get a drink with Mitch McConnell they asked really why don't you get a drink with Mitch McConnell with Biden you didn't waste a lot of time talking about things we knew we would never agree on I didn't lecture him he didn't lecture me we got down to the areas where there was possible agreement and were able to get to an outcome a very different experience from being in a negotiating setting with the president
