so Kenneth Copeland is one of these guys who claims to be a prosperity preacher so what does that mean that means he Rob's you for his own benefit he says oh I'm talking to the Lord Jesus Christ and he said that I need a mansion and your dumb ass has to pay for it and then I talked to Lord these guys you're not gonna believe this he says I need a yacht and your dumb ass needs to pay for it and then now lately and and a lot of them do this and I'm gonna give you a couple examples here why preachers do what black preachers do it they're like oh this is good this is a good scam man these these guys will believe anything maybe this guy walked on water with virgin birth you know what guess what they need it turns out I need a jet and so this gentleman Kenneth Copeland asked for jet and he got it they gave him money for his own jet so he is beside himself so he did a video bragging about it rubbing it in people's face oh you give me a hundred bucks your kids candy for can't eat lunch for the whole week like a white jet you moron serious we took possession of the Gulf Stream 5 and we give God praise for it and Thanksgiving it is debt-free this opinion it's bigger play hey are you looking at this you seen Jesus father we thank you sir and I'm asking you now sir according to you for bless our partners beyond page yes in the name of Jesus for you said in 2002 I'm sending you new partners who are very strong financially and they love it and I will increase your longtime partners and they will obey and you will not come short and you will not fail and you will not like and you will not come behind and you will not be diminished praise time is coming too fast you know what Jesus is Lord man they can find an excuse for anything in the Bible they took that quote out of the Bible of where you should be in the high place on earth it doesn't mean you should be in a high place on a 36 million dollar jet and that's what this is it's a 36 million dollar jet you hear that cackle yeah hey he's laughing at you you don't even know when he was talking about partners I was like wait is this a business or something does he have business partners in which case okay if they made a lot of money they buy a private jet that's their business not my business right no no my partners they mean the Schmucks in the pews who gave me their hard-earned money thinking they're going to heaven when I just took their money and I turn it into a 36 million dollar jet for my own ass what are you doing with the chat what is a big aeroplane what do you need that big aeroplane for I see you and your wife what are you doing are you loading that plane up with dozens of people going to feed the hungry and the poor no we just likes to go around the country and comfort okay in case you need to clarity on that by the way he brags that it's debt-free yeah it's that free because other people paid for it hey you're the people who mistrusted you and believed that you had their best invention of mine where the suckers who paid were that's why it's debt-free so in case you're confused about it here's where he got the idea Jesse Duplantis who's another one of these scam artists preachers Hindman and Copeland sitting around or it appears to be a kitchen table but it's not it's a TV set meant to make it seem like oh they're just just they're so homely and I having a conversation about hey how we gonna pay for things like how oh you're getting a bologna sandwich how am I gonna pay for that nobody in their case they're talking about jets so listen brother cope and I was flying home from a meeting and I had come out of a glorious meeting I just found me in creflo dollar with preaching had a glorious meeting so I was for lack of a better way to say it I was spiritually high people were saved touched and blessed God in the plane that God so graciously gave us we flying home as I was going home the Lord real quickly suggested do you like your plane you know I thought that's an odd statement he gave I said well certainly Lord he said do you really like it and I thought well yes Lord he said then he said this so that's it I didn't know how to handle if a man went what he said you're gonna let your fate stagnate now when he said that that shocked me I'm like whoa wait I literally unbuckle my seat belt my plane I stood up my pilot's look I said you need something I said no no I'm talking to God right now he went back to fly I said lord I don't think I was letting my faith stagnate he said so this is all I could ever do I said you want that you you're trying to tell me something when God tells you you fade stagnate you better start listening yeah something I thought stagnating you can't stay here yeah you gotta do this or you're gonna do this he said this your own control cruise control you're moving but no longer by your power see that's what the DVD is well that's what that is the DVD they're trying to scare me with okay so get a load of this guy first well he says I talked a creflo dollar will give come back to creflo dollar because he's another preacher that rips people off for jets I'll come back to you in a sec okay so they're all in it together okay but then he get I was like I had to watch that video twice I'm like wait who was he talking to turns out he was on the Lord in the plane he was on the gun and did you understand what he said God says to them your plane sucks you got a private jet not good enough I don't want your faith your faith to stagnate you need to ask your dumbass followers for a bigger jet that's what that conversation was about really you remember one got interrupted you in the middle of somebody's hey by the way Bob you need a bigger jet you remember when you had that conversation with God how could you believe this how can you believe this God O God how do you believe this really you think that guy that scam artist is talking to God and God says don't feed the poor don't feed the needy don't take care of the sick you need a bigger jet who's that Oh God man look I love you guys I don't want to yell at you that if you gave them your hard-earned dollars and you think you're going to heaven but you're wrong you're wrong they're tricking you they're laughing at you on that jet now here's Copeland one more time telling them and talking about taking a passenger airline then that have to be in there with regular people watch you could have done that on an airliner no sir no way stand up and say what you say long no okay no yeah and the guy said no listen what the hell is he thinking do it do do that no no the world is in such a shape we can't get there without this ice we've got to have this we would have the mess that the airlines are in today I would have to stop I'm being very conservative at least 75 to 80 more like 90 percent of what we're doing because you can't get there from here it's impossible so we we and this was such a good illustration I just the villain impressed me that's why we're on that airplane we can talk - oh God we truly it's when I was flying for Oral Roberts the brother of due east my my boss on the airplane he said now Kenneth this is sanctuary it protects the anointing on brother Roberts and he said you keep your mouth shut don't talk to him unless he talks and because when he's on a meeting he doesn't talk to anybody but God now all used to fly Airlines right but it even back that in May it got to the place where it was agitating his spirits who were coming up to him he had become famous and they won't mean to pray for them and all that you you can't you can't manage that today right this dope filled world right get in and air get in a long tube with a bunch of demons right that's exactly then it's deadly and and it works on your heart it really does that's what they think of you man get it out all along - but demons - who are the demons we do regular people to them really yeah demons and then they're agitated your spirit by asking you to pray for them and I've tried to pray for you you idiot give me a check give me a check that's gonna be my sanctuary how can you believe this how could you believe we can't get down 75 90 percent on one we need to do it if we didn't have a private kid I'm gonna do gotta feel fly with you regular people which we despise and called demons they don't want me to pray for you your goddamn pastor that's what seems to pray for people and God their contempt for you is unreal and yet you give them money so they can laugh at you behind your back Jesus Christ literally impossible yeah nobody can get around this country on a regular jet nobody takes planes don't you have your private jet it's impossible to get around otherwise I mean I gonna do if I'm fly with all those demons so like I told you another guy looking to get private jets who's another prosperity preachers creflo dollar and and he already had a jet but he thought that was not good enough and I'll show you why in a sec so he asked his parishioners retort not 36 million dollars for a jet Koplin flying to love creflo wanted 65 million dollars for his jet so he got a lot of heat for that and and then for a little while because the media attention he said I'll kick you fine fine I don't need 265 million dollar check and then once people stopped paying attention you know what he did he went back and asked for the 65 million dollars yet again yeah unreal yeah you know what let me skip to graphic 47 for a second because I want to read to you the very last sentence in and when they asked for the jet again this is dollar now by the way he says last name is dollar he named himself creflo dollar anyway we the world changers family so value the lives the safety and the well-being of our pastors and leaders that we wish to provide to them the best air travel experience possible I love that quote because they're not even pretending they're not pretending is for you it's for the needy or anything they're like how could a pastor of a mega church fly around with a tube full of demons he's gotta have the best possible jet if he doesn't have a 65 million dollar jet how in the world is he supposed to talk to Jesus Christ it doesn't matter where they're from it's the bottom line is the only thing they care about man ripping you off is someone if he may care about but why does craft Lord again hold on not one more time he named himself that's not his given name he named him so creflo dollar what if he gets his jet you know what he's just gonna change his name to I rip you off and you're like oh okay great oh man that I rip you off Reacher is awesome where do I send the money okay now why does he need a new jet because this is what happened to his old jet oops I guess Jesus wasn't his co-pilot now wait when I thought the whole point of the jet was because Jesus was on your side why isn't Jesus looking out for that jet of yours huh it's almost as if he wanted you to crash the jet cuz you're such a scam artist ripping off all the people who came to church looking for salvation yeah and then you know what he did of course krafla turn around cuz that's this is all they do is lie lie lie lie so he turn around goes oh the jet crashed by the way nobody was hurt did she crashed because of the grace of God well why he's like what a crash but no one got hurt look Lord Jesus Lord Jesus just not crash it in the first place don't ever send these guys money man the world's biggest scam artist if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT
