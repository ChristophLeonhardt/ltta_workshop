for Easter and we will publish the real information on our website now we'll go into our traditional agenda to the main problems about foreign policy and we will start with their developments the situation in Syria and the situation over the last week has remained very tense against the background of some achievements in the negotiation progress process which helped us to save thousands of civilian lives the activities of the extremists have have been intensified as well as the activities of their sponsors willing to dissent to even radical actions in Syria in order to that would serve the interests that have nothing to do with the aspiration of the Syrian people unless it's a febrile there were new shelling of the center of Damascus and eight people were killed and 40 injured Syrian military had to storm of the city the tone of duma Leeuwen strikes on their staff headquarters and the basis of the illegal armed groups the governmental forces squeezed the terrorist fighters from the southern and the eastern district of the tongue and the world some statements published associated with the white helmets reading that have come under chemical attack from all the Syrian governmental governmental forces they said that thousands of our civilians were killed then the number was made small but even the materials that were present online there were a great deal of discrepancy discrepancies differences but that didn't disconcert community that were prepared such a provocation many pronouncement on the pre-emptive actions nobody in these community demanded the imminent investigation our for this situation and raised no doubts about the footages filmed at the time showing children and adults pouring water on themselves and these way allegedly demonstrating the use of the chemical weapons information was taken at face value even when they showed the halftone bomb that was on the need bad and in a room with a blown-out frames with intact windows people started to call for the punishment official regime of Damascus should be punished and it was a red-top reaction against Syria like to say that the threat against the young member is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter this were the present by the United States and France and against the backdrop of all the statements moister by the permanent represented of the ESC we'd like to raise a question of whether it is legitimate to use force against a sovereign state the arguments in Russia that's right for the critical revelation of these ossification that the doctors went on this last side but they didn't find any evidence testimonies of the victims nobody clarified why should the government of Syria use chemical weapons when the rest of out there militants were blocked and conditions for this vacation were discussed major media outlets and the representatives of the Western capitals of chemical weapons in their deposits in the liberated part of using chemical weapons used by militants against the governmental forces in the cities of surgeon al and 100 victims of Syrian servicemen were found that that in that case we stand for the immediate objective investigation of the aforementioned cases and for our position and now the UN Security Council the Israeli aviation strike on the 9th of April did not bring any stability to the situation this was an attack at t4 in 70 kilometers to the west at found mirror and it's worth noting that this attack coincided with the anticipated intensified operation on the part of the terrorists Washington continues to voice explosive warmongering statements that are thought with the dangerous escalation they're not only against Damascus they say that Russia is protecting al Assad's regime and that it is to bear responsibility for his crimes this is voiced and by the leadership of the United States in the first place please I mean first of all the President of the United States has announced war on fake news all the information which is not used for informing the population fought for misleading the people how can we important decision about using force in this case when we do not have the picture clear picture before our eyes and we call all the responsible members of the international community to seriously consider the consequences of such accusations such threats and the planned actions nobody authorized Western leaders to take upon themselves rules of the world policeman and also of investigators attorneys judges and executioner's our position is auto defined we are not seeking escalation and we hope that our partners will be reasonable enough to come back to the legal framework and to solve the issues in a course will to the end is shorter I would like to state once again that there are no second escalation bow we would not support those lies that are pronounced like also to draw attention to the Prime Minister of Great Britain Tony Blair who asked to express solidarity with the United States and to start a new military campaign in the Middle East he says that you do not need the approval of all the members of the Parliament to start such an operation and we know what happened in his own time and many times the political leaders economists and has of the humanitarian organizations so what the consequences of the opening of this Pandora Box July 2016 the British Independent Commission had it boy to code which was studying the consequences are for the Iraqi campaign it was a flagrant mistake and all these words are based on erroneous recognized that the invasion of Iraq was based on the incorrect special services data and which caused the shaping of the ISIS the consequences for these hard also for the region and also for the invading countries still reaping the fruit of it we have never taken part in that constant function and we have always cited effects to prevent such an invasion sorry to see situation we have taken another turn and now we are already in the footage of that situation also in Russia and the ISIS at the port which is being fought against now it is a fruit of our their awkward policy he looks towards Iraq and the neighboring countries there were thousands of people were killed in Iraq and many people had to we this country to find refuge terrorists used up all their techniques available to them to intimidate the population and it was in Iraq when they were trying to find chemical weapons they didn't find one but they disrupted all the infrastructure including the renowned the famous moments of world heritage I like to dwell upon this situation and you know how the situation had rolled starting from 2003 any politician in place of Blair would try to come out ministry and he actually make a new pronouncement about supporting use of force against the country and another country in this region his alloys such a reckless adventure this is his attempt for his political future disseminated data on occasion relating or to the possible use of chemical weapons in the city of Douma and the tone of demand this information was provided by the white helmets and the Syrian American Medical Society I'd like to remind you that yesterday you have not been questioning is it her war everything was done what follows this decision to the taken some hours passed some time fast and now we have the details of his fabrication and when we attempted to contact the heads of this organization the World Health Organization the Director General at home and his deputy Salam were not available for comments and they were not in Geneva at the time some sauces on the basis of which they made at the same time this well failed to mention that and they failed to name the medical centers where these 500 victims were taken and they didn't clarify counted the number of victim services established and determines the diagnosis and the cause of death they said that this a highly reliable sources but we know but the value of such sources and we regarded as an attempt to disseminate an uncrowded information which incites to new aggressive actions and we urge the World Health Organization to show partiality and not to be basing on the organization that have caused discredit upon themselves but on the opinion of the experts who can come to any conclusions on after a detailed work yesterday as you know but with the Russian journalist so was shelled and one of the correspondent of the anti-v TV channel and one Russia and so is that which analyst who were injured are they were going to Damascus returning from a Western Eastern good and it was commented by the Defense Ministry all the injured gained received a medical assistance and they feel good now and we wish them speedy recovery and return for us to be able to get information first-hand information from Syria now we are turning issue which is also complicated scoop health case and it's not a secret information campaign or other war unleashed by British authorities instruction so-called Cooper's case they used all types of forces and means of propaganda and this anti Russian campaign I think seen for a long time authorities ignore things of international law or the principles and I think even ethics and the best drop of their silence multitude of different comments of political nation from the very beginning tenuously also against washer we receive every time new a new versions of what is going on and we know the various discrepancies and fix misinformation that nobody is going to refute from this massive propaganda campaign uses all sides media and communications perfectly fitting the strategy of Great Britain against Russia the authorities of this country I'm watching a targeted campaign distorting the reality why do they do this is pretty much clear if they would wanted to go into the details of what happened and argue what happened and analyze the discrepancies in this case then assurance and some involvement of Russia wouldn't be so real clear and everyone would ask themselves a question that we all have to ask London London what happened in Salisbury the kernel of the Russian intelligence service who worked for British special services from 2010 she lived in Great Britain he served his part of his sentence for his crime committed in Russia and he was voluntarily extradited to Sweden he was pardoned by the President and was exchanged within the program of exchange of spies and his daughter Julia the citizen of Russia constant release in the Russian Federation as we got to know out of the blue in a small city in Great Britain where neighbors know each other and pay attention to everything what is going on there in the city which is not a center of tourism or pilgrimage poisoned as sold by Great Britain by one of the strongest nerve gases classified in the West 2004 from the moment when scruple was sentenced for treason nothing Russian no later after it was cancelled in the Great Britain Moscow according to the equations of London found no better time for this retribution but one week before the presidential elections and three months before the FIFA World Cup and the belt robbed of this discrepant says more questions and until the investigation started there were a lot of comments on this issue Moscow was isolated from the investigation at all they learned a lesson from it the Yonker case but probably when initially Russia was involved in the investigation in it complicated the case the analogy with this case it was announced by BBC 6 March BBC made the parallels was the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko but there is one important nuance this case is not a standalone case at that time at least we saw some images of Latini Anka at least his pictures as for a script house until now only months has passed nobody saw them there is no chance to contact them somehow Media Russian channels even though Russia sent notes and was always said no the last Russia is not standing aside London doesn't want to listen to be involved in the investigation at least a scale and coherence of the comments by the authorities and a lot of leakages superb leakages we have to somehow participate in this case there are no doubts that's everything that is going on there is a deadly plan and strangely realized from the point of view of logic and logistics of provocation against the Russian Federation new strategy of information war was fully tested on this case just pay attention to the lack of comments of the official authorities representing investigative bodies of this case it was explained by the fact that the investigation is classified because of the interest of national security of the state how come that almost every day in the mass media of the Great Britain the different type of information with the references sources close to the victim sports it seems that this is not so secret the case or maybe there are people working in the special services would not were not aware very well of the state secrecy I know that they know but they know perfectly well how to maintain secrecy we know that they classified information for for a long time and do it well we have all the grounds to come back to our first idea that those leakages that we noticed and that are happening now well-planned and in general despite the number of leakages and the mass media nobody commented on them and this is another director with the future of this case kind of mark of this case a lot of leakages and fakes from the authorities so in the end within this case why did we mention a new kind of development of this in this case it's simply that we could say that it it is kind of unprofessional behavior but it's not true we know perfectly well how the British work in the sphere of information we saw a lot of clear and emotional statements but resume in the parliament the statements made by Boris Johnson including in mass media also doing briefings press conferences of the investigative authorities we had to clear a lot of discrepancies and leakages during this case in the press and there were no explanations because there were no such because it was not serving their interest for for London if she's 90 pretty nigh here but I'm watching solution is at Union umbrella Union it was too complicated for them so the number of versions of what had happened according to the British media and the number is impressive much 5 Salisbury Journal informs that emergency service think that it was fentanyl the toxic agent and was from ZZ confirmed this Telegraph said the same then the comment was the latest nevertheless it was kept in cache of Google what kind of data was published there why they decided to delete it on March 6 and nothing is known Boris Johnson preliminary in says in the Parliament that country will stutely respond to any involvement of Russia into this incident so they took the decision they now instead on March 7 Scotland Yard now is that Sergey universe cripple were poisoned by nerve gas and the police doesn't mention what type of toxic agent was used and Daily Star published that probably it was done by a killer much 8 a metro publication say that food was poisoned then much 10 they said that the Western was poisoned restaurants easy and they supposed to clean their stuff the recommendation is published on the webpage of things government of Great Britain and they mentioned that they are talking about the poisoning of the most and by the most dangerous urgent and the authorities of the Seas days just say to clean their daily milk the same day informs that the flowers left on the cemetery could also be poisoned much 11 new version by Express magazine the delivery was poisoned received through the Career Service March 12 to resume said that it was combat nerve gas used for poisoning of the victims and then now it's clear that scruple and his daughter were poisoned by nerve gas developed in Russia Nova Chowk based on positive identification of this chemical agent imported down and considering that Russia produced this agent before and still has the possibility to produce it as well as considering previous financed by Russia killings and according to OSS evaluation that Russia has the motive for this the government decided that Russia Holly probably used it to against Sergey and Julia's cripple and the only and there is a clear explanation of what happened other it is a direct action of the Russian Federation against our country or the Russian Federation lost control over this dangerous enough toxic agent and it got into the third hands and March 13 Mail Online provides new version of the events the substance was put on the handle of the car March 14 to resume official accuses Russia indeed to kill street powers and representative of the great prison at the UN John Allen also said that Great Britain there's no option just to consider Russia responsible for this March 15 Guardian said that they have the evidence of overwhelming but the evidence of participation of Russia and posing of street pals but he didn't mention which exasperate evidence says the same day Telegraph publishes the article that saying that the urgent used poisoning of scruple was in his daughter's suitcase according to the magazine the toxin was in her suitcase some clothes was had some marks of the gent or Maddox Forrest Johnson on March 17 said to BBC that he will personally follow the investigation of the incident March 18 Daily Star said that trip outs were poisoned by the use of drone Guardian said that the gas was distributed through ventilation of the automobile no authorities commented on this March 22 in the comments the outcomes of the EU summit said that there were no other explanation but to accuse Russia in doing this 28th March British police inform that screwed pals found wearing touch was no be choked at their home because some the biggest concentration of the urgent was identified at the door handle at home 29 of match for novice accused Russia in distribution of misinformation through development of various versions of what happened in Salisbury so it seems like we have a lot of versions of what happened first of April tabloid sun publishes the material that the agent could be brought in the package of backwards or in some spices that universe crippled had no time to take with one she was packing to go to london and asked her friend to bring it to her was it a joke or another version do believe it is okay in the situation to make such jokes it is not funny according to another version of the joke was placed on some kind of booklet advertising materials that was meant for strip house this version was a published in British press New York Times referring to some authorities said that the door and placing the toxic etchings on the door handle is a good idea and only Russians could do that whether it was the personal the instruction was given personally by the President of the Russian Federation is explained by the fact that he can cover the information very well so in in Twitter they were finally published some explanations of the evidences additionally to the distributed previously six video slides so the first button down identified the agent used as nabhi chakra seven Russia started the delivery of nerve agents and had some a reserve of another choking so Russia had motives to kill crippled in the account of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of freedom do is information on this case the information is very interesting Russia's hold on what happened in mixed with other interesting pictures of what is going on in his life it's just interesting to follow the development the whole information campaign so this the old campaign is too complicated for all British politicians just take a look at Boris Johnson's fight with the head of the Labour Party who had another interpretation of the Boris Johnson accused the head of Labor Party that he supported Kremlin and and made its propaganda more convincing is it our propaganda then he went further and said that Corbin was a Kremlin's useful idiot that was Boris Johnson I do not even mention in the media no political force in the country wanted to call to census and start a normal investigation if such things are spoken so the politicians face how can we talk about any manners of communication with the media of your country the main argument which Oh more or less as used in all of this information campaign is that the official British position requires no proof you should just believe in it moreover so this is exactly what the British diplomats say when their colleagues ask them on when they are going to provide the proof they just say don't you believe us and it is worth talking about the situation on the origin of so-called knowledge shock as was mentioned before the first mansions of the use of this substance or made by there is a male on the 12th of March and ever since in spite of Russia's calls to deal with the situation and investigated at least in some way and to discuss the information on Russian origins of the substance nothing was done it was not put under any doubt on the 4th of April the head of the Portland down lab gave an interview to Sky News in which he said that the experts managed to identify the substance as belonging to the knowledge shock type as cold in the West but they could not identify its origins but they passed the data to the government which later used the information from a number of other sources and made its final conclusions what other sources could be used to get the information that requires specialized chemical and lab analysis does Britain have any other labs except pores and down that's something you neither the Foreign Office no the internal ministry have such capabilities for studying and analyzing at least we were told so to analyze this substance so if they portion down lab could not determine the origin of the substance then what are the sources were used by the British government to get such information and make their conclusions at the same time the head of portion down lab refused to confirm or denies that lab had samples of the substance saying that no such thing could originate from their lab take a look at this so were they producing or developing such substances or could they not leave the premises of the lab these are different things the sayings is so failed that it does not provide an answer whether they produced it or not and if they did on the tenant could not leave the premises on the land following the interview there was a reaction by foreign office and they declared that from the very beginning foreign office made it clear that the Porton Down experts identified the substance used in Salisbury as military great knowledge shock nerve agent but this is only a part of the picture based on intelligence data as declared by the resume in the house of comes from the 12th of March their conclusions are based on the fact that for the last 10 years Russia was studying the ways of delivering nerve agents possibly for political assassinations rush they say Russia also produced and accumulated a number of such substances and Foreign Office repeated that keeping in mind Russia's reputation there was no other explanation for Salisbury incident other than Moscow's responsibility for these daring action how do you like this legal basis we don't know who did that but since we do not know who did that and we have no proof that it was done by anyone at all we come to the conclusion that it was Russia what rules of international or national law say this they have a chapter on such accusations which are not based on their suspicions they are based simply on the fact that there are no other logical explanations why did the Foreign Office declare its official position after the interview of Portland on lab it is clear from the article of the former British ambassador to his Becca stone it was published before the conclusions of the organization it mentions the tensions between Foreign Office and the person down the bar 3 we do not know if this information is true we do not even know if anything published by the British media is true but since we're quoting them and since we're quoting the British media then why not quote mr. Marais the ambassador according to him the British Foreign Office was asking the lab to state that the substance used was Russian in origin but they managed to haggle to the saying that the substance was developed in Russia moving on on the 6th of April the British made another publishing in the media and quoting and representatives of the intelligence community and government sources they said that the substance was produced in the secret laboratory in yes Naboo yes such geographical precision they did not provide any facts as usual but on the 9th of April Financial Times published an interview on the Soviet chemist who in spite of his anti Russian position admitted that there could be no confirmation that the substance was Russian in origin and like the radioactive materials it leaves no traces and cannot be located by usual methods no comments from the British officials on this no declarations about it and another interesting fact in December 2005 and later in January 2006 in issue number 49 of the Journal of medical chemistry of the American Medical Society there was an article by the British scientist which included important down employees it provides a similar formula to the one published in Michigan's book phosphate substance so the specialists in Britain could synthesize this type of substance on their own back in 2005 but these are all speculations which arise from the materials of the British media there are apparent discrepancies in the media coverage which are used they're using their unnamed sources I will give you several examples but these are very important examples nonetheless for example the matter of antidote was there one was there no antidote and moving on to the next block was it used was it not used take a look the articles in the British media take a look what the agencies published either say it was there it was not oh there's no antidote at all there's not a single person in Britain who could declare and take the responsibility for explaining the situation but there is a situation aside from the case itself which as we're told should be classified because it's a matter of national security there are also publishing in the media which provides new versions every day can we at least comment on them as for the doctors this is another topic there were many Publishing's on the doctors who are refusing to provide aid and we don't doubt the capabilities of British medical field but listen what are these doctors who are the doctors who work with military-grade poisons agents either using the antidote or even without one is some kind of miracle and the leaks of course now following the close briefing for the intelligence community in Britain on the 6th of April according to the data that was leaked following the brief things we know that the hospital in Salisbury where the screep house was delivered also had doctors who were prepared to provide aid to the victims of chemical weapons this is another miracle and begin the manipulations on the antidote whether it was used or not and how it was applied and so on the next topic that was covered by the British media what we do not know the answer what were they poisoned with was it one substance was it a group of substances was this a substance of one type or were these different substances I would also like to take note of the declaration of the head of the local hospital of Salisbury as we are told we do not have the official data but we are that they never confirmed that the victims had symptoms of chemical poisoning on the 16th of March one of the doctors of the hospital in his letter two times said that out of those who asked for medical help on the 4th of March none of the patients had symptoms of poisoning by a nerve agent only three patients supposedly the scruples and the policeman had serious poisoning symptoms once again if this date is closed or classified why publish a letter in times if this is a matter of the hospital having its ethical reasons not to provide information how could a doctor write a letter on the situation inside the hospital publish it in the media no sources claiming what they were poisoned with and other statements say that the script pulse and the police were exposed to nerve agent in fact this means that this could be anything the same for the specialists is absolutely vague blind this means nothing they may as well have been close to the poisons agent not touching it or not exposed to it they could have been attacked by these substance on the 10th of April the chief doctor of the hospital once again says they were exposed they describe the standard symptoms of the poisoning and then the doctor was evading any use of the words chemical or nerve agent so ask ourselves what were the symptoms of the script pots how were they treated how are they diagnosed all of this information keeps circulating but there is no official confirming or denying information how can this story be interpreted how can we interpret the story that was continued recently when once again there was a declaration on the intention to destroy all clues including this cripples house how can we interpret the fact that aspects can be interpreted in any way nevertheless this cripples are in isolation we have not seen them we do not know what happened to them according to the sources in this security community this cripples house as well as the Zizi restaurant and the mill pub that they attended where their daughter will be demolished why not inspect every centimeter of the building the bench on which the script parts were found has already been destroyed we did not have time to inquire on the fate of the pets living in this cripples house for the pets this was not a matter any so-called animal rights or animal protection no this was a matter of this crippled case because this is about the possible use of the chemical poisonous agents we did not even have time to ask questions on these animals when the media provided official and non-official statements on this topic and they once again absolutely ruined the picture of what happened supposedly the animals were left in this yield house how could they not be noticed when the house was inspected by people in protective gear they located the chemical agent on the door handles but they did not notice the animals do you believe that and it's so strange that numerous pictures were published by strippers on social media with their pets and everyone knew that they had pets finally some of these has died of dehydration once again according to the information we have they did not die of poisoning by toxic substances they died of dehydration another pet was stressed Andy they had to put it down all the information provided is absurd absolutely absurd it causes only more questions but no one is going to answer them supposedly there was another pet but was not located at all neither before nor during the incident perhaps the bats were located perhaps they were found during the search and what came of them and where were they taken it's unlikely they were taken to the foreign office although they loved cats there most likely they were taken to bars and down and what happened to them there these are the questions that no one asks in britain which is most important everyone's laughing they find it funny they make pictures that he discuss it are the questions asked by any person with a logical thinking remain unanswered it's worth noting that from the media we find out that the veterinarian that was working with cripples pets said that he had information that the pets were taken reporting down right after the inspection of the house and as of today there are no pets and the house will cease to exist rather soon just like the bench and I'd like say once again that the delay in publishing information on the pads and the confirmation that they died of dehydration or were simply destroyed and eliminated and I'd like to remind you that this information was concealed by the British media it was available to BBC by they did not publish it this is another indirect confirmation for the fact that they're trying to hide the evidence they're doing everything in order to confuse the whole story from the beginning to the end as for the relatives as you know in 6th of April Britain refused the closest family calls relative from scribble Victoria they refused to give her the visa on the strange circumstances there were no declarations on the reasons on the way of the refusal on whether she could apply for the visa once again or whether the decision was final every agency in Britain had their own version some through leaks some through talks with their trusted journalists some redirecting the questions to other agencies what is strange here you do not want to give the visa you do not wish to do so this is not a matter of national security then talk about it they're not doing that once again a million of versions we understand that formal explanation on the reasons on on giving the visa is backed by their own political agenda I say once again that up to this day this cripples have no contacts with outer world with outside world in violation of the rules of international law we do not have access to the Russian citizen as reported by Times and other newspapers and this is another topic this cripples will be will have an opportunity to change their names and move one of the countries of the Western five party intelligence alliance and in the 11th of April we found out that us cripple was transferred through military installation hospital why are they doing all of it the answer is simple they want to constantly support this topic afloat while not answering any question on the essence of the case on the same day Scotland Yard in the name of us crippled published certain declaration saying that she did not want to communicate with the media and she asked her sister Victoria not to come to London and may we ask a question here why then was victorious cripple was refused to come to the country while not motivating this by the wishes of her sister she was also unwilling to cooperate with the Russian embassy of course we would like to get proof that this was really sad by Uli's crippled doubts about that after all the helmets going on the media of Britain and declarations of the British politicians it was noted an official comment of our embassy the tax is designed in that way for proving the official position of the British authorities in order to avoid any contacts of the Ilia with the outer world anyone over there relatives are the Friends of screwballs op you'll escape all they do not maintain such contact so this is surprising this striving to strive and so what family we are talking about and it's a sound very strange that no one is talking on my behalf he studies like it talked is detective story now it looks like three learn we understand very well that real experts are working in Scotland Yard and they have a demonstrated to Britain and to the all of the world the professional professional level and why is the letter published by actually in Scotland he are now the developments show that we are speaking about the isolation of Russian citizen we have all the grounds to believe detention of Russian citizen or even their forceful that is a patient in some staging of events there are many questions and there are no answers I'd like to mention the position of other countries who express their solidarity with Great Britain their comments and the opinions do not look not only biased but they look awkward and absurd on the 8th of April they will express it published the statements of Western politicians politicians illustrating the transfer of verifiable data reliable data on the rush on Russia's playing this media outlet didn't take the pains to actually verify that the Western countries have not received any data the deputy foreign minister Sikorski of phone he says that the stand up the information the profundity of the information provided by Great Britain didn't matter because we swore as a pattern of context of Russia in the past so is it right that Poland has its own established position and also citing the one of the polish representatives is that that they didn't have to think much about that but isn't it right to think in this case when you're laying mean in other countries so he said that they didn't have to think much so that is how they are taking their decisions the deputy prime minister of the Czech Republic says that to the trusting in their Western partners although they are hearing the phrases the statements law about highly likely to tell that it is not serious would be not enough because we are thinking about the crime and the investigation and this is not a game in this case and the fate of the light of those people are on stake the lives of those we have not seen yet the use of the word solidarity yes we have mentioned that fact to conclude I would like to say that we have all the grounds to bring about an accusation against London on the propaganda and manipulation of all the public opinion nice like also to say that like to repeat once again that we do not have any of information regarding their whereabouts the consequence the circumstances of the cases miss crippled case I'd like to get this information from the foreign ministry by sending the diplomatic notes and we urge Great Britain to give us information for us to verify that our Russian citizens are in safety and for the world to understand that they are not hostages that they are not actors in some kind of manipulation that they are alive and that they could speak for themselves for us to see something that could be used as a reliable source of information like also to point out that we have forwarded terms of diplomatic knowledge to the Foreign Office that are devoted to the request to get information and to joint cooperation and also to the condition of our desk reports and to gain corresponding access the diplomatic meant to carry out the work that are not carried out by journalists we would like to verify the information disseminated in the media sorry to say not even single requests to verify to confirm or deny anything an information has received any answer for instance I'll assign several examples last year last week the competent authorities received Russian requests on the attempted murder of us crippled this request remains unanswered I'd like to get clarification on the what is happening and all the details and like to clarify because we see a statement about the substance that was fragrance fragrance free or substance on the child substance on the handle and I would like to see material evidence denial of such information is a way to conceal and to destroy all the evidence relating to the case mr. command also sent a request to the head of our Hospital and celebrate Salisbury in order to clarify their condition and the circumstances relating to the st.paul stay in that hospital so we tried to get that information from the ministry and when we didn't have managed that in Russian Ambus ambassador had to return to hospital and our ambassador also send a personal message to us RuPaul we do not know if she got it in the statement that is attributed to yulia which was published by Scotland Yard it doesn't say anything whether she has received such a message from our ambassador and we ask for clarification regarding the interception of two messages which was sent from Syria to Russia which was were immediately linked to Russian involvement in the case by the British authorities and it seems that they are reluctant to give us any information as for the obesity data coming on 12 April the Technical Secretariat Secretariat disseminated among the state members the report on the samples taken in Solebury from the father and the daughter from his group also document confirms composition about the toxic a legend which the use of which allowed affected three people including the British policeman this was a toxic agenda which was highly pure and in contained any additions this also the fact we're statement needs further clarification and of course we should make any conclusions having a this chemical and spectral analysis results before our our eyes and of course we was open to the joint work with the British side and I would like to take face value any evidence until we get access to the results of the OPCW examination and to the whole volume of the data relating to the case this is not a question relating to trust or faith this is a question about studying concrete specific materials to believe those who are citing information on behalf of other people it is impossible now and we are drowned in the flow of misinformation which is supported dated by official London we do not have any grounds to believe that it is not the continuance of provocations undertaken by the British intelligence services special services now we go into other topics Russian US relations do not give us positive emotions are thinking about talking about the disruption of our activities and we are talking about the disruption of the our consultation mentioned to be hot on the 11th or 12th of April and they were requested about the State Department of the USA and it was the American initiative we were ready to receive the American delegation in Moscow we were prepared for a substantial dialogue that would be attended the participation about the Russian archives of the foreign ministry and DeRosa to insist well but last week when all the preparatory work was finalized Washington informed that when they were not going to come and this is not the first time than without any meaningful explenation the is the u.s. 40 disrupts the course of the talks of the consultation consultations and it is weird to hear that it is connected somehow associated whether the expulsion of Russian diplomats and that was response the amount of ativ response told the Russian policy and we are open for any cultural and humanitarian cooperation with the United States and we think that these cooperation would improve our relations and would facilitate understanding between citizens of our countries and we think at Washington we hope that it will assume it's a pragmatic and a constructive approach in building a Dalek in this area and we received a request from the media and we would like to comment on their bio laboratory in the post-soviet space we seen many about publication on that matter about the u.s. biological activity in the territory of the former Soviet republics and in accordance with article 10 of the convention of the prohibition of dodging toxin weapons it provides full day development international cooperation in this area but there are certain concerns of the American activities in this post former Soviet territories the USA creating anger from microbiological laboratories interests Caucasian and in Central Asia and a clear illustration is the opening alpha laboratory near Belize see a small town of alexeyevka this is a third level biological containment laboratory it is meant to conduct experiments with the pathogenic agents for causing tetras diseases we understand that is that the massive biological activities near the borders of Russia this is a fact of serious concern and it raises issues regarding other reasons for such activities like two strands was once again that an estate is right to develop the cooperation and activities in this area but all such activities should be in line with the international law and any state is undertaking those activities they should understand the results and the consequences all for their developments for including for their neighbors we have also received questions to comment the sentence for sure the 11th of April the residual mechanism or floor Tribunal for criminal tribunals revised of the acquittal sentence who was accused of crimes against humanity and he was then convicted to 10 years of imprisonment and we'd like to remind that Churchill had stayed for four years in the preliminary tension center and a we we're not speaking about taking into account of this sentence although there is no material published real sentence published but there are materials available that testify to their contradictions sorry to say that this mechanism is the tribunal Yugoslavia but in a very negative way and it continues the artists serbian sentences and it undermines the impartiality of international law we believe that this residual mechanism is a temporary structure and we hope it to be transparent transparent and efficient in the fields of justice and the terms of executing the sentences Makati i would also like to comment on another we were asked to comment on April 10 there was the case of Seabreeze of the Ukrainian company according to the information of the general consulate the crew of the detained sheep about 20 people are mostly ukrainian citizenship only two of them are from russia is from - observer is navigating under the lease flag in accordance with ukrainian the sheep was arrested it was accused in illegal sand mining and according to the Ukrainian side in the period from 2014-2018 another vassal Pechora was navigating there also belonging to the same company representing this company the ship is company artists and they are also trying to protect the company within the legal framework the detailed information on the ship owner and the lawyers representative refused to give he was given the contact information of the general consulate in Odessa to be given to the owners of the ship but nobody contacted the general consulate and there is no show information from the Crimean authorities about the arrest of the vessel that we are following the information and will be ready to assist as soon as we receive the request from the people representing the ship for the research week we are seeing the situation with the ship north under pretext our citizens of being held on the sheep keep inventing every time new reasons not to let the crew go to their families the cynicism of the Ukrainian authorities again the man clearly demonstrates the this biased nature of Ukrainian authorities and because they are claiming all the time their commitment to the rule of law but they just harassing ordinary people we urge the Ukrainians to stop holding our people and we hope that the international community will respond until our citizens held in the Ukrainian territory of Russia reserves the right to retaliate on April 17 in the Embassy of Russia will take place an event devoted to the medical center of Russian Japanese friendship it is the project about together with Japanese partners the ambassador of Russia to Japan will participate in the event as well as the Ministry of Economy industry and trade health and other agencies and ministries of Japan the participants are also heads of different centers and medical clinics and the area of medicine the new medical center is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and equipment it will be created on the basis of the American Center of the branch of Maine administration for service to the diplomatic corps and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Center will provide wide range of services to Russian and the representative of diplomatic missions representative of international organizations as well as Bureau accredited in Russia the aim this project is a positive indicator that confirms a high level of Russian Japanese relations I would like to draw your attention to another fact to publication from 5th April in the other masti about spending of budget about budget spending as if there was some document and supposedly MFA doesn't provide data on its budget spending everything was provided in accordance with the data of NGOs we have already commented on this in Vietnam astaire unfortunately the request was sent to us on April 9 understand too when the working day finished we just haven't noticed it and we asked to publish our comment it was some for some reasons published in the section of letters to editor but when we send our comments on the essence and I'm going to tell them the newspaper for some reasons also decided not to publish it but it was the comment on the essence of this thing and the reason another thing there was a reference to Michel de loggin he said he said nothing the publication apologized and so on and so forth so if we put aside all these discrepancies in media I would say that the reality is that MFA is a responsible executor of the policy of the Russian Federation foreign policy and timely provides to the Ministry of Economic Development to the Ministry of fine finance of Russia a quarterly in the early reports on the realization of its program but some information considered state secret and the indicated materials are not published in the portal of state programs of the Russian Federation in accordance with the regulations protecting security information and confidential information at the same time despite the specificity of the activity of the MFA that I mentioned and the information openness is provided through Internet resources and we think that the information is given openly at RADA high level and we our actions are guided by the folder of the president of 10 August 2018 about the approval of the list of MF activities published in the Internet next annotation April 11 was established floor were established flights between Egypt and Moscow on October 31 2015 the specialist in the security from Russia and Egypt made a huge work on strengthening security in the air and airports of Egypt not about to prevent recurrence of the cases that had taken place before we hoped these will help to reestablish our relations between Russia and Egypt and strengthen these relations on the memorial complex Levin devoted to the liberation of Slovakia from fascist the event took place with the participation of the ex-president of this country heads of some ministries and agencies representative of local authorities and Russian compatriots as well as deputy chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy ambassador of Russia to Slovakia union of the veterans it is now a challenging time when our relations are being tested and the traditions of friendship and cultivation does it for the resistance we're grateful for people of Slovakia for remember in the role of the Red Army liberated so IKEA from fascism and their respectful treatment for the graves of the Fallen Red Army soldiers now I'm ready to take your questions about what report agency yesterday and Azerbaijan took place in presidential elections according to preliminary data a live one today we had breathing with our Western partners observers from Paula mentor assembly from of the OSI and they registered violations but the data is different from the statements made by the omission of DSM yes I believe that we will receive some comments from the administration of the president I would like to say that the elections of the president in Azerbaijan a lot of observers were present not only observers from countries but also from international organizations they will make their comments but we understood very well and we announced that what was the mood of various political forces and it was clear that some countries accept negatively the presidential elections in Azerbaijan we saw some the same mood in some political parties and in the West and it is not only with respect to thereby chances but also with respect to other countries we believe that there were a lot of observers as I said and they registered everything they have to give their opinion that we should based upon yes please a statement made today by my pumpy that there is no place for soft power we just have to pull the same now is it a continuation of the yesterday's announcement made by Trump in Twitter after yesterday's and statement by Trump who will receive another one today and I think that today we have to consider the comments in Twitter made today you are citing miss upon pelo we believe that we have to do some work as soon as he is appointed to this position and as soon as he starts his work we will proceed to evaluation of bilateral relations the prospects of development in this relations the first approach or well this approach cannot make happy Russia there are some problems if there are some disagreements as it used to be we have to discuss them in meaningful way what do we like to do to solve a problem to improve our relations if we speak about similar statements I do not think that they are meant to improve bilateral relations at the same time we believe that we are open for meaningful dialogue we are not closing doors and we proceed from the fact that the potential and the necessity in normalizing bilateral relations is what people expect about in Russia and in the US and I would like the American politicians to remember this because their political position also matters there is political platform and some discrepancies of political nature but there were also people on both sides of the ocean in those countries they have to communicate to receive visas in due time to visit their relatives to participate in humanitarian and sport events to participate in exhibitions to participate in cultural life of the countries this is what people want people in Russia and ordinary people in the US they do not want war for escalation any political or some other clashes people want to normalize relations and it's evident I have a lot of friends in the United States and of course in Moscow I would the last 24 hours sent a lot of comments about the statements that we read in mass media from the US why somebody wants to worsen the situation I have no answer for that I believe that normalization both of bilateral relations and in general the situation on the international arena is due and with a lot of comments letters of people from all over the world and they all repeat the same it is so easy to start a conflict and it's so difficult to get out of it and I with it again the task our task is to normalize relations but not to worsen them yes please Russia today I would like to ask you more details about the statements made in Twitter yesterday you had kind of dialogue was the president of the US he made his statement in Twitter just be careful with what you say because they can add something else some other connections with Russia the social networks are different Facebook and Twitter I wanted to know could you comment is it something ordinary to communicate through social networks and is it appropriate I believe that the way President of the US talks to his people is a question to the American society not to the Russian Federation they chose the president and the president found the form of communication that he considers appropriate it is not our issue another thing we believe that and we understand that growth of social networks and it all permits the use of various types of communication popularization of social networks and they're using social diplomacy is rising and it's like 180 great turn towards the use of this social networks if some time ago we was said that social networks have the same rights as mass media and the blogger is a journalist and we were saying that then we have to raise the issue of responsibility we're not against its fact that the responsibility is what it matters the distribution of the information must be responsibility of mass media but they were against our position and now London Paris and Berlin moving towards proving some laws that could regulate or control the activity of social networks and they would like to introduce some legal frameworks for that it's a radical turn in approaches another thing social networks are becoming object of great attention in the United States and special services and authorities we know pretty well the meeting was Mark Zuckerberg and the pressure on the campaign we're running the social networks and nobody was hiding the information about that we are perfectly aware of all the act made by the campaign this step was meant to secure themselves from the further influence of intelligence services which in fact planted themselves in the social networks in the United States of America but we understand clearly that the social media our mass media in fact they have a great coverage which of course should go in line with the matters of security a matrosov and the terrorist activity meaning that we should prevent the spread of such information through social media at the same time we also understand perfectly that cannot mix up these two areas the first one is the matter of preventing the use of social media from turning into an instrument of terrorists and another area is the possibility of spreading information free communication of people this is a very massive block of questions yes please yes thank you national course Information Agency I question is there an official version or versions why these provocation with cripples was necessary for London and Washington and do you think that this incident which happened after the president's address to the Federal Assembly when the u.s. press began making reports from some senators yes that yes rush can be dealt with then thus crippled case who came and it well went to nothing I think this is directly linked with the situation in Syria we have already mentioned this this is one thing second thing is that this is the matter that ghost within the general anti-russian agenda and anti-russian narrative and this is also a matter of the internal consumption of information this is a matter of complicated talks of London on proceed as well as other problematic questions on the current agenda the situation could have been used to divert the attention this is a complex question this is a provocation which solve a large number of tasks I see once again that we think this is directly linked with the events in Syria this is an attempt to take away Russia's arguments in the discussion of the matters of the use of chemical weapons in the territory of Syria this is apparent in fact following the whole campaign it was unleashed against Russia due to the Salisbury incident there was a provocation with the use of chemical weapons in Syria they did not just accuse us they made very aggressive statements on the use of force and as we mentioned today these declarations will address to the Masters directly more or less they also concerned Russia this is a complex provocation it has several directions I think our task to talk about this topic this is up to you to find the truth most we in the search of truth have rather limited resources I say once again you can't even imagine the number of diplomatic notes and letters and addresses sand through our embassy in Britain I can't even imagine that all of this remains unanswered but still these are the questions that are on the agenda why not ask them the British the BBC for example I can see here good afternoon thank you for the prohibition of chemical weapons several hours before your briefing published the report the complete report and the light version of the report and reportedly the full version contains the formula of the poisonous agent used in Salisbury and the full version of the report was spread therefore Russia also received a copy of the report if you have time to read it and what data does it no no I didn't we could only take a look at the brief version the brief description of the report is summary that's preceded the full version and as of the beginning of the briefing I did not have the information on the availability of the full report if it becomes available this is what we than anyone else it will be studied by experts and they will provide their conclusions the number of questions previously and today we repeated the basic questions that we have to the organization to the report that was presented today once again I did not have the full version of the report yes please thank you very much for giving me the opportunity the national course newspaper the national course between North Korea and the United States with threats of mutual destruction and the story wait hands North and South Korea became much closer now we have the same situation in Syria between the United States and Russia and therefore I have a question what are the current sentiments between the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Ukrainian foreign ministry so Korea Syria and Ukraine what are the sentiments the Foreign Ministry of Russia and for an extra week rape previously were talking about Syria and Korea allow me to explain yes please tensions between North Korea and the United States so they are threatening with nuclear weapons for apparent reasons but this situation went away everyone forgot about it North Korea and South Korea became much closer after that and today we have the same situation we have threats from the United States we respond to them so I have a question what are the sentiments between the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Ukrainian foreign minister I still can't see the logic here question I can just answer the sentiments between the Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's and unfortunately the sentiments are not optimistic as you know this was also demonstrated by the presence of Ukrainian Embassy in Russia and Russian Embassy in Ukraine recently we saw expelled diplomats besides we can talk about the atmosphere it's not a good atmosphere yes please it's our great TV channel and still in your opinion why did Trump and the US administration make threats concerning chemical weapons in Syria and saying that they would attack a sovereign state there are numerous versions including versions the industrial and military complex of the United States should use their budget that Trump should report to the Hawks in the Congress he is under pressure I have my personal version that several days before this France Ankara hosted the three party meeting with the presidents of Russia Turkey and Iran perhaps the United States is trying to break the Astana format and make turkey face a choice either you with us or against us I cannot deny your version but it still remains a version I think that this is a global concept that was stated by the previous administration it can be formulated in one phrase acid must go times are changing presidents change the administration's change but this is a very suitable strategy simply exists and it goes fully in line with the so-called red line is constantly mentioned this red line means the you of chemical weapons by Damascus and we have already approached these dangerous life if you remember the same statements were made by President Obama who tied in strikes with use of chemical weapons by Damascus but back then there was an opportunity deprived the countries and the political forces that stated the red line of their argument because chemical weapons did exist on the territory of Syria and Russia suggested the United States and the whole world community this idea was supported by Washington we suggested the idea that was implemented in practice on the chemical demilitarization of the country of Syria so several years later chemical weapons are not in Damascus possession on the concept remains red line still remains and according to the Washington ideologist this should become the trigger which will start chemical weapons everything is the same still working on the strategy I think that those who stand behind development and implementation I'm making a bet the opinion of the public asset and chemical weapons are associated with with each other there's a showcase for the whole situation what is the motivation of the current declarations internal motivation the international community I think there is no direct answer much can be said here I do not think you should ask us this is a question to the political scientists and journalists and perhaps the official representatives of Washington and another precision do you think that Trump is under pressure in this case because if we take a look at history Trump has always avoided direct accusations against Russia and its leadership I don't think we can talk directly about a certain force pressure buzz the fact that there has been political pressures for one-and-a-half year I think is apparent there's nothing to prove here this is the pressure that's carried out by the losing side actively works as an opponent to the administration they do not simply criticize it they're trying to prove the elections were not legitimate and they're trying to tie the matters on presidential activity with the recent elections and they are constantly using the Russian factor in this battle of course there is political pressure but whether we can we talk about it in this context or in others it is out of the question I can simply confirm that in our understanding this is political pressure in words yes please I'd like to say cripple has resurrected this is inappropriate another question on the declaration of Donald Trump don't you think that he is not aware of the situation so the second part of the question truthful I've personally asked myself this question I asked myself whether in general the leaders of different countries and had a foreign policy head of diplomacy of different countries of NATO for example are aware of the real situation whether they have the real information this is not a question to us this is a question to them this information comes to the top officials whether they have the real information if you remember the decoration bacitracin me what information was used for the statement we were told that there was a certain report the Intelligence Agency and it was not exactly truthful because there was no confirmation by this is one of the examples of the British prime minister using information that a couple of weeks later was debunked by the British structures themselves the fourth in Dunlap in particular the same goes for Boris Johnson the foreign minister so this is a good question but I'm not the one who should answer that recently there was a nursery of the dust free of the polish plane in the Smolensk and my college in Warsaw are asking two questions when is the investigations coming to an end and when will the debris come back to Poland we know the answer so I have another question for many years we holding investigations on the airplane crashes in Russia and in other countries which for example involve your planes they is very clear and all the conclusions are made very fast but what is happening in the investigation committee for eight years they cannot find the reasons for people call they crash of the Polish presidential plane all the discussions are very fast it provided an answer yourself no I think you know the answer you are well aware of the political agenda covering the question I'm answering the first part of your question you asked me what is going on unfortunately all this could be opened all that could be provided as evidence for the Polish experts and investigators and the people working there everything was done by Russia and we were ready to full-fledged cooperation with Warsaw which was done I think that we cannot accuse Russia of hiding and concealing anything or not providing Poland with access it's impossible why is your investigation committee unable to close the case for eight years honesty to the Polish state time to give back the property to the owner well I understand that your second question on giving back the property to the owner is linked with the first one the fact that the investigation is still on ask why this case is not closed in Russia perhaps this is not very ethical but I have the same question for the Polish side why can't Poland close this case we also know this the answer polish proposition is that for example reclaim the debris the investigation but why can't you hold the normal investigation with full access to the debris on the territory of Russia there is no clear answer from Russia with the green the presidential plane crashed in Poland for example and the debris would remain I think truly wish to hold a real investigation not a politicized one and the experts and specialists can always find ways to communicate unfortunately later we saw that after an unprecedented openness and transparency of Russia and cooperation between Russian and polish experts we saw a whole number of political forces in Poland starting to politicize this problem this is what we see and I think that unfortunately this is the key and the answer to all of your questions asked this question I can ask the same question to you why all the data provided to Poland including these recordings that will decipher them provided to the whole world community there are still published on the Internet spite of the fact that we showed a maximum transparency why is this topic still present in Poland why do we always hear accusations towards Russia no one's accusing these are the questions why don't you do not give the debris back I do not mean your questions I mean the declarations of Polish politicians and Publishing's in Poland you can't deny that this is how it is linking the story with the accusations of Russia and don't you think that was Planes belongs to poland and it remains in small ends region this is not the reason for doubt how can we have any doubt if Poland has access to the place what does this have to do with the lack of trust from Warsaw you're talking about trust how can we talk about the lack of trust the case is on the personal control of the presidents of two countries there was not on the investigation cooperation was much wider than just the investigation keeping in mind the unprecedented nature of the catastrophe President did everything they could to make it as open as possible which presidents it was the Prime Minister and our president died didn't you have a president but he did not take part in the investigation I mean the state leadership I take my words back I do not talk about a head of state our president said and confirmed what was said and this was written said that any requests from Poland will be satisfied this is - any materials and if we need to work with the plane debris so if you need to work with our experts and other materials you're welcome to do so we are ready for it but as of today there is no single request from Poland which satisfy it all which would come as of today I do not know of any of them I am NOT a speaker on this topic we have relevant experts who comment on this topic by constantly reading the materials of the Polish media I am forced to get back to this topic and every time I verify and check the information following each way from the discussions in the Polish medium I always asked if there were any refusals to poland to access the materials and the information on the case as of today no exact one to return the plane so we returned into the same question that we started with so there is investigation underway and it hasn't been finalized in Russian to the question why this question should be posed to you also why do you have these investigation all I would like to say once again that in any moment when Poland requests any materials or access to the debris of the plane then it will get it get this materials and access sorry to say but these topic has become a major topic in the Polish political life and this is a great problem this is not a question about finding it through the truth it's not about working and studying the material evidence it is well honest to make this topic circulate so you want us to prevent from mistakes by maintaining the debris in your territory no I do not want it so you think that this topic will be closed if it happens I think it will be sooner and that the case would move in a more speedy way if we talk about this scale that this topic has been discussed in the polish media space we should say that this topic would be dear present for a long time and this is not question about the expert scrutiny about the it is about the willingness to have these topic flowed maybe I'm mistaken but I'm reading the articles in the polish media and I has here the statements from polish politicians apart from politicizing I did not actually see any willingness to double-check anything to request any documents or data they just wanted to circulate and to be present in the media space CNN Maria I'm against a backdrop of discussing the possible strikes on Syria to believe the development of the Geneva process is still possible against the background of what discussion of the possible airstrike strikes on Syria I believe that the Geneva process so you mean the Russian stance or in general Russian stones so we believe that use of force in this Syrian scenario isn't acceptable and moreover all researching of the Security Council's and Council and the decision taken they say they read that the crisis in Syria could be resolved and only in a peaceful way way and this is a position of the UN Security Council and proceeding from the first point that is our main position all of the Istana process and the Geneva process that amounted to consolidate the Syrian forces the governmental and opposition forces they are very important for marking all mementos apiece in a practical charge whether the statements creating the impediments for that process yes of course whether they inducing the extra months on the grounds to continue terrorist activities and extremist activities yes certainly to the inspire the military's military fighters yes I would say that when the Israeli forces deliver the airstrikes and then the u.s. spoke about that these extremists and terrorists groups intensified the activities we and the United States and other countries actually decided to solve this problem in a peaceful way at the horn of newspaper and to the voice of Israel and this is a question relating to Syria first time yes good afternoon it's the first time that I see you but I'm watching briefings online every time how long have you been in Moscow have you been living in Moscow for 13 years I have not always been a journalist so yesterday mr. Putin and mr. Netanyahu had a telephone conversation and I would like to ask what do you think about the relations between the relations between Russia and Israel after the developments in Syria over the last week as you know your first time here we don't come and actually the events that are attended by the president this is a question to the president office as for the developments we of course do not agree on some points and speak about the airstrikes but we are discussing this in a very friendly way and we would like to find our common ground in the future and we today we have stated our position very clearly I think so you can come and join us next time is that your channel I miss Sahara have two questions the first relating to Nader our diplomats noted an acceptability for the native groups near our borders and also noted the various cases of violations or for the Vienna document and other documents our position is being ignored how can it be explained and how can we change at these situation and the second question relating to the second sanctions package about the years how can we our response be symmetrical or asymmetrical as for the first question before taking making a decision we are do not discuss these decisions if they are made they would be made in a consolidated way and then voiced the situation in Europe has become more tense the military presence of NATO in its eastern flank and as for the presidents in Poland and other Baltic countries the four battalions have been under the intervals and the total number of other personnel and was about 5,000 people last year and it is it equals murder tank brigade this number almost the same in Latvia and Estonia and some other countries the there is any arbitrary patrolling of the this countries and these ships visiting of the territories about the Black Sea and other seas and the and visited the poles of our Finland children and some other states for the operation of the earth the Atlantic strength this widening of this operation equals to two brigades brigades and as for the Russian deterrence policy we do not actually rule out of the increase of the presence of the US in that region there is a development of out the year notary and civilian infrastructure and large-scale exercises of the Allies we speaking about about ten or twelve thousand servicemen and well thousands of hundreds of thousands of men take women units that are based on a rotation or e terms rotational basis that wasn't acceptable without the Act of 1997 and all these efforts Nader Allies are aimed to create a stronghold to influence Russia and at the same time Russia is not interested in any further collation of the association areas folders and we call for the Alliance to think about the fact that these actions are relating to the escalating tensions and to aggravating the situation in Europe and thus threatening their stability in all countries including in NATO countries do you have any other questions strange that they are still there yes please good afternoon thank you very much trend news agency Baku the recent agency to the task I met family if informed the agency that relations with Russia is a priority of Azerbaijan and occasion in relation about the victory of alia how do you see prospects of fashion as Virginia relations and what are the main priorities priority areas can he point out not enough to speak in general that I've applied to this general terms of responding to the questions on the elections because we will develop relations with Azerbaijan that would be aimed at meeting the interests of our peoples different areas on the initial a beneficial basis basis of mutual respect have a great prospect for such relations let me better to present detailed in-depth material for you during the next briefing that would be very useful to you with facts and discussing the real prospects and the real projects yes please Sputnik news agency today of security of Estonia is celebrating its anniversary anniversary and every year they find they've published an annual report on the Animus of Estonia and these people are getting some black sports and Russia today and Sputnik also got those black marks so Russia is called an enemy and is listed the year how can we respond to the situation and how we can rectify it as for the difficulties that Russian media face in pop in this country it is well known because generalists are denied accreditation two important events and Russian public officials are denied communication with other important public figures and because these are very deplorable facts that go in on line with the priorities proclaimed by telling with regarding in the production of the freedom of speech and we have great concerns about this and we think that it aims at restricting of the activities of Russian media and other media that publishes the dissenting articles or dissenting materials whether the governmental governmental establishment I see the UN and the Council of Europe this structures could influence the situation and we draw the attention to the facts when we have the information of our OSE colleagues and this time we will do the same it's now to the agency channel and he said about the isolation of a u.s. cabal and they have the same information published by the russian embassy in the UK and as for the Russian actions what they would be and you know that Russian citizen can be detained in some place you understand that we do not have information about there she is detained in a forceful way or wish whether she is in some hospital for in some structures late into their special services of Great Britain so we do not under a clearly understand that and we do not speak about a trust it was undermined on the part of London when we were denied any access to the materials so we believe that as Great Britain doesn't provide us any data relating to the whereabouts and the conditions of UNESCO path and neither do we have any material of media materials that would be credible that would have maybe have seen her or the data from her relatives so we do not have any evidence that she is detained the latter that was published in the Scotland Yard website on behalf of us people it is very weird and it's true this is this is a very strange letter because this raises radial of questions rather than given answers and basing on that letter we should ask ourselves whether she has access to the media actually suspicions to the style of the latter considering the situation in the world if this girl has an access to TV or Internet does she understand what is going on beyond the borders where she is contained if yes then this restrictive mode and this latter is surprising but I believe that there is an understanding that we could state contrary that she is in isolation physically and from any access to mass media to the sources of information and what we will do we will ask access from the British authorities to provide as factual information to participate in investigation that we hope had take place had taken place on the territory of Great Britain and we hope that the data was not destroyed more questions yes please international information Anderson news from front Bulgarian Bureau the same question if Great Britain is not going for to contact could the parents or relatives of scrip house to ask for an international investigation or referred to some international organizations on human rights it's a question to the relatives are some legal procedures that lawyers can use there are some steps that they could have used not because they were forced to do that but because they were they are relatives and they made those steps and got refusal this is a house story those legal mechanisms that shall work in such cases they are not working unfortunately and on my joseph's news dot room question about libya due to multiple information requests on health of a person and their and difficult situation in libya and possible vacuum of power could you give your evaluation of the situation in eastern libya the situation is very complicated unfortunately we cannot register the trend towards some improvement in this area but at the same time we are trying to maintain contact with all parties involved those who represent this used to be state that is trying to establish itself and this is everything I can say I can ask the experts again prepare a more detailed comment on this issue more questions than next round short questions to have some information as to how the border between Russia and Belarus will look like during the world because foreigners for the moment cannot cross it there are no control on the border do have some news on this I will ask to provide more details on this from the experts as you know we have already discussed this and to give you the information the last that updated I shall specify it yes please on Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism and for seven years there were attempts and there was an attempt to separate opposition from terrorists and why the escalation is taking place because there were attempts to peacefully settle the crisis in Sochi one of the scenarios the prospect of real settlement on the grounds and lack of prospects for further development of force of the scenario where the force is used to stop using provocations to apply pressure if there are no more questions then I say your goodbyes thank you
