So we're currently outside of
the Christie's Headquarters
in New York before the biggest
evening sale of the year.
Where literally hundred
of millions of dollars
worth of art is going to be
sold within a matter of hours.
Let's check out some of the highlights.
(groovy music)
So Alex, we are underneath
Christie's in a secure room
where some of the most
valuable lots of the upcoming
post-war and contemporary
art sales are being housed.
That's what we refer to as the vault.
The vault of paintings
gets stacked up and ready
for the big viewing experience.
So what are we looking at right now?
This is a painting by one
of the most well-known
artists in our field,
Jean-Michel Basquiat.
It's very aggressively painted.
His paintings are about
the feeling of a black man
living in the United States in the 1980's.
And how much does it cost?
We have estimated this painting
called Il Duce, 25 to 35 million dollars
and the pricing is based on
what we feel of the quality
of the painting, but it's also
based on what we know about
the private market for
Jean-Michel Basquiat.
This is an A+ painting from this artist
who is very hot right now,
it falls in line with what
we've seen in the last
three or four years really.
So behind us is a very different work
by Mark Rothko from 1957.
It's a hard shift from Basquiat to Rothko,
but it's also wonderful shift.
Rothko is one of the
father's of the purely
abstract painting, the
gestural abstraction.
Rothko, Pollock, are the
ones that really opened
the mind to the abstract form.
What is this estimated to sell for?
Interestingly enough, it's
also 25 to 35 million dollars,
so it's in the same price
bracket, very different feeling.
Yeah.
So another painting from 1957,
so the same year, Cy
Twombly Sunset painting.
The Twombly is about 20 million dollars,
the same year as Rothko,
so it's interesting
to see them actually in a
sequence because it's two great
abstract artists of the post-war period.
So, we looked at two 35
million dollar paintings,
one 20 million dollar painting.
These are like the greatest
hits of the art market today.
Do you have anything coming
up in the sales for the mere
millionaires to purchase?
Absolutely, we have
something for everyone.
Let me just go to the next rack here
and see a wonderful Kerry James Marshall,
priced at one to one and
a half million dollars.
A bargain.
A bargain.
This is a different price range.
Beautiful canvas, rare to
come to the auction market.
Just coming off some wonderful
museum shows in America,
in New York, in LA, we have
very high expectations.
It's a really beautiful painting.
This is a perfect storm
of very high-profile and
high-priced artworks coming
together at a specific point.
Do you think that we can extrapolate
from how these paintings
do, to get a better sense
of how the art market is or
where the art market is going,
or do you think that we
should really, kind of
consider this sale in a vacuum.
I think you can definitely
get a general read
off the art market after the
sale, once the results are in.
What day is the sale?
Big night is November 15th.
Okay, and that's when all of the works
that we've just seen...
And many more
... and many more, are gonna
go up on the auction block,
and we'll see how they do.
Exactly.
