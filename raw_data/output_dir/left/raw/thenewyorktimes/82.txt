00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:15,936
[groans] Oh.

3
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:20,684
[cow cries]

4
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:24,350
Something ain’t quite right
with the baby, is there?

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,835
[cow groans]

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,272
[cow moans]

7
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,212
Oh …

8
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:50,194
[vehicle drives off]

[cows moo from shed]

12
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:57,910
60 pounds?

13
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,880
80.

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,460
80?

15
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,682
God, some of the ones that
seem so tiny are huge.

16
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:05,572
Um-hmm.

17
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:14,440
He looks like a 70, 60 …

18
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,480
[cow groans softly]

19
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,489
No dying on us.

20
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,376
Oh, you’re one of those
wobbly ones, ain’t you?

21
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,140
Come on.

22
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,988
All right, well … see
you in an hour or two.

23
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:40,462
[children shouting

[rooster crowing]

25
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,028
Oh, I almost got
you in the face.

26
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:53,668
[dog barks]

27
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,896
Ready, Rosie?

28
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,756
[child screams]

29
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:00,430
O.K.

30
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:00,930
Whoa!

31
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,430
[laughter]

32
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,710
That was a good jump!

33
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,540
Carrie, Ken — Ken get on here.

34
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,745
Ken, Trudy.

35
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:07,245
Whee!

36
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,830
They used, like, when Grandpa
Foss was a baby, that’s

37
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,010
the only thing that they had.

38
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,160
Well, the back things
are, like, really —

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,970
I know …
— You could snap it.

40
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,565
We’ll have to fix this.

41
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:30,670
Oh, all we got to do
is put a board on.

42
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,490
Yeah, well, I don’t want
you guys getting stabbed

43
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,812
by these nails back here.

44
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,137
Where’s my bike?

45
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,917
You want to go put a
board on it right now?

46
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,000
I have no idea if we even
have a big enough board

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,212
to put on that.

48
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:45,780
[cow groans]

49
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,180
Hey, there, [inaudible].

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,970
Ah!

51
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,230
There you go.
Come on.

52
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:05,058
You got to work with me here.
[sniffles]

53
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:40,220
How’s that?

54
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,725
There we go.

55
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,118
Look at that.

56
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,420
All by yourself.

57
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,552
Oh! Easy now.

58
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:02,420
Bring that leg back up.

59
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,912
Bring it back up.

60
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,590
I’ll fall down!

61
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,545
Stand up!

62
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:43,995
[cow bellows]

63
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,669

[cow grunts]

65
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,631
Well we’re just going to give
him just a little bit, O.K.?

66
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:59,590
We’ll give
him just a little bit.

67
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:15,380
What do you think?
Should we name him?

68
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,635
Um, Frodo?

69
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:18,790
Frodo?

70
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,342
[laughs] She’ll be Frodo.

71
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:24,235
Well, I guess that’s
as good name as any.

72
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,171
Turn that heater on for you.

73
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:35,528
[heater starts]

74
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,476
There we go.

75
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:38,799
There we go.

76
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,346
O.K., buddy.

77
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:43,076
Come here.

78
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:45,024
Frodo, you got it.

79
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,250
O.K., are you ready?

80
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,630
Other way, bud.
Other way.

81
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:49,489
Oh, there.

82
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:50,280
Yup, yup. There you go.

83
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,190
See how he’s trying?

84
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,540
He’s trying.

85
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,015
His little tongue’s
a-licking.

86
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:55,930
Aah!

87
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,512
Frodo, that’s just gross!

88
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:02,411
[inaudible] at me.

89
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,782
Look at him.
He’s nursing.

90
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,344
Good job, buddy.

91
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:08,320
Good job.

92
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,932
O.K., Mom, I’ll stop now?

93
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:15,895
O.K., go ahead and pull.

94
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:16,515
His tongue …

95
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,700
Because he kind of stopped.

96
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,520
You got to listen.

97
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,470
Because sometimes
they’ll take a breath

98
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,924
and they’ll suck the
milk down in their lungs

99
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:23,840
at the same time.

100
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,214
So you’ve got to —

101
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,486
yeah, sometimes you’ve
got to pull that out.

102
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:29,201
… little nose
a little twitch.

103
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,915
Twitch, twitch, twitch …

104
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:34,408
Oh, look it. He says, ”Hi, that’s
such good stuff.

105
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,396
I can’t even pull my
tongue back in my mouth.

106
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:41,628
[laughs softly]

107
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:05,284

[metal gate slams]

110
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:40,900
Mom, Mom!

111
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,394
Don’t let her out!

112
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,980
She wants to lay down.

113
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,500
Do you want her to lay down?

114
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,006
What do you think?

115
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:03,204
I don’t know.

116
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:05,430
I’ve — first time I
ever pulled a calf.

117
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,256
Dad’s never left me alone.

118
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,570
Well, she wants to lay down.

119
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,655
Well, then let her lay down.

120
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:15,650
Just let her go.

121
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,006
Let her go.

122
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,380
Are the knees
trying to get out?

123
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,840
There a little bit.

124
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:34,390
[cow moos in distance]

125
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,877
[cow groans loudly]

126
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:47,707
Come on, push, baby.

127
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:50,326
There you go.

128
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:52,308
Push … push.

129
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:53,812
[cow grunts]

130
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:54,808
Oh!

131
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:55,804
[cow groans loudly]

132
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,318
There you go. Push.

133
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,640
Blech.

134
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,462
It doesn’t want to come out.

135
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,700
No.

136
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,846
It does not want to come out.

137
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:10,462
Where’s your nose
at, above.

138
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:11,535
Right there.

139
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,966
He’s not sideways, is he?

140
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:17,866
The shoulder is, I think.

141
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,040
I wouldn’t piddle
around too long.

142
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,610
I’m trying not to.

143
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,380
Push — pull down on the baby.

144
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,342
When you pull, pull down.

145
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,505
It’s not like I’ve pulled
a calf a 110 times, either.

146
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,606
But you’ve pulled from a goat.

147
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:42,643
[cow groans]

148
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,061
You’re doing good, mama.

149
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:51,584
There we go.

150
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,836
Let her get dilated …

151
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:02,401
[cow groans]

152
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:13,257
[grunts]

153
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:20,780
You just be careful.

154
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,760
If she starts going down,
you get out of the way.

155
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,681
[grunts] Push, baby.

156
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,570
Push.

[thundering hooves]

161
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,450
Hey!

162
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,710
Hey!

163
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,510
Hey!

164
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,950
Woo!

165
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,367
Woo!
