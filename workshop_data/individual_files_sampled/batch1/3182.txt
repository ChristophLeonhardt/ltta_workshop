see daddy's home dogs are loyal to their owners and to their families because they evolved as pack animals um they have close social relationships with the other dogs or animals in their pack and this is because they are cooperative hunters they actually raise their young cooperatively and when they've moved into our homes and into our lives our families have become their pack and sometimes when they lose a human partner you know we've seen these circumstances where they will sit at the grave of an owner for a period of time and so they develop those social relationships with us and so for these dogs this is their connection to how they need to survive
