HAS BRANDED "A SHAM."
YESTERDAY THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IMPOSE NEW
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE FOR MONTHS
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SCOPE AND
DURATION OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
INVESTIGATION ARE NOW ASKING FOR
A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR OF THEIR
OWN.
THIS COMES AS PRESIDENT TRUMP
CONTINUES TO INSIST THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT LOOK INTO REPORTS OF
AN INFORMANT INSIDE HIS 2016
CAMPAIGN.
CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT
CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS IN
WASHINGTON TONIGHT WITH WHERE
THINGS STAND.
>> THE PRESIDENT LEFT NO DOUBT
TODAY WHERE HE STANDS ON REPORTS
THE FBI USED AT LEAST ONE
INFORMANT TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE
ON HIS CAMPAIGN.
>> IF THEY HAD SPIES IN MY
CAMPAIGN, THAT WOULD BE A
DISGRACE FOR THIS COUNTRY.
THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
INSULTS THAT ANYONE HAS EVER
SEEN.
IT WOULD BE VERY ILLEGAL.
>> WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN
PRESIDENT BY HIS SIDE, THE
PRESIDENT DID NOT AVOID
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS DEMANDS FOR
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO ACT.
>> SOME PERSON GOT PAID A LOT OF
MONEY.
THAT'S NOT A NORMAL SITUATION.
>> THE SUSPECTED INFORMANT MET
WITH CARTER PAGE AND SAM CLOVIS
AND AT ONE POINT WAS RECOMMENDED
FOR ADMINISTRATION POSITION.
THE INDIVIDUAL WAS KNOWN TO
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN
PAUL MANAFORT BUT THEY WERE NOT
IN CONTACT DURING THE 2016
ELECTION.
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S INSISTENCE
ON A PARALLEL INVESTIGATION AND
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EXPANDING
AN EXISTING PROBE TO COVER THE
INFORMANT ALLEGATIONS, THE
RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ACCUSED
THE PRESIDENT OF OVERSTEPPING
HIS AUTHORITY.
>> THIS IS INFORMATION THAT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, FBI
EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT.
>> WHAT'S BEEN SAID IS DYNAMITE.
IT'S THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIME.
>> HOUSE REPUBLICANS ASKING A
RESOLUTION FOR A SECOND SPECIAL
COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE A BROAD
RANGE OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI
STANDING A THREE YEAR PERIOD TO
INCLUDE THE CLINTON EMAIL CASE,
ALLEGED GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE
ABUSE, AS WELL AS HOW AND WHY
THE RUSH INVESTIGATION BEGAN
INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
>> THIS PRESIDENT HAS TURNED
OVER 1.2 MILLION DOCUMENTS TO
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER.
AND YET OUR DOJ AND FBI, IN A
SEVEN MONTH PERIOD, HAS
DELIVERED LESS THAN 19,000
DOCUMENTS.
>> DEMOCRATS ACCUSED REPUBLICANS
OF IMPROPERLY INVESTIGATING THE
INVESTIGATORS.
>> NORMALLY WHEN YOU HAVE
CONGRESS TRYING TO INTERFERE
WITH AN INVESTIGATION, THE
PRESIDENT PROTECTS THE
INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.
HERE THE PRESIDENT AS PART OF
THAT INTERFERENCE.
>> YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT UP WITH
THE GUYS WHO WROTE THE
CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE
SUPPOSED TO DO.
GIVE US THE INFORMATION WE ARE
ENTITLED TO SEE.
>> WHITE HOUSE BROKERED MEETING,
LATEST INFORMATION INDICATING IT
WILL BE THURSDAY AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.
SOURCE CLOSE TO THE DISCUSSIONS
SAID IT'S NOT CLEAR THE RECORDS
REQUESTED BY CONGRESS INCLUDING
THOSE ABOUT AN ALLEGED FBI
