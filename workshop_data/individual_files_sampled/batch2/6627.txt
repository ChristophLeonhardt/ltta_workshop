OVER THE WEEKEND CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THAT HE WAS FINDING IT FRUSTRATING THAT IN HIS ATTEMPTS AT NEGOTIATING THE SHUTDOWN DONALD TRUMP WAS BASICALLY NOWHERE TO BE FOUND, THAT HE WASN'T ACTUALLY WORKING WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE HE IS A GREAT DEALER, DEALMAKER AND A STABLE GENIUS BUT THE WHITE HOUSE DIDN'T LIKE THAT SO THEY WANTED TO SHOW HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP IS WORKING TO GET THE RIGHT SORT OF DEAL AND SO THEY PUT OUT SOME PHOTOS AND THIS FIRST ONE IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE. THERE HE IS, WORKING HARD AND THIS WAS IN AN EMAIL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THE PRESIDENT, HARD AT WORK. HE IS ON A PHONE. HE TOOK UP HIS TIES I GUESS HE IS WORKING HARD. THEN THERE'S IS NEXT ONE. HE IS WALKING FROM ONE ROOM WHERE HE IS WORKING TO FOR A HAVE TO ASSUME HE WILL BE WORKING. SAME HAT. THIS IS CALLED A PHOTO OP. AND WE HAVE ONE MORE. THIS ACTUALLY COULD BE A MEETING. I THINK HE IS HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS. A COUPLE POINTS OF PEOPLE HAVE MADE SO THIS IS NOT NEW COMMENTARY FROM US BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURES. NUMBER ONE, IT'S A PREDESIGNED PHOTO SHOOT SO BY DEFINITION, NOT ONLY IS HE NOT WORKING AT THAT TIME HE'S TAKING WORK OUT OF HIS SCHEDULE TO DO A PHOTO OP. NOW HE WILL WALK RESOLUTELY FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. BUT REMEMBER, DON'T CALM YOUR HAIR. LET'S BUT HAD ON. HE DIDN'T EVEN ABOUT DOING THAT. HE HAS LIKE WAY, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SHOWER, WAS WATCHING FOX AND FRIENDS ALL MORNING. THERE'S A HAT ON AND THEY DO MY FAVORITE, PULL UP THE FIRST PICTURE ONE MORE TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO AN EDITOR AT THE DAILY BEAST. SHE SAID: I TOO CONDUCT MOST OF MY IMPORTANT WORK WITH A PHONE IN MY HAND AND NOTHING ON MY DESK WHILE STARING VACANTLY OFF INTO SPACE. EXCELLENT WORK ON THAT TWEET. WHAT IS HE DOING? WHO IS HE CALLING? IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE IS NOT THE MIDDLE OF WORK BECAUSE HE IS LOOKING AT THE CAMERA. HE CAN HELP HIMSELF. THESE PHOTOS CAME OUT AND IT JUST MAKE THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION LOOK RIDICULOUS BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL A LITTLE BIT BAD FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND WHOEVER SET IT UP, I AM SURE THAT THEY REALIZED HOW RIDICULOUS IT LOOKED AND I BET THEY WANTED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HE WAS REALLY WORKING FOR HIS LADY LAZY ASS, THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST HE WOULD DO FOR THEM. I WAS AT THE DESK, I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM. I ALSO FEEL LITTLE BIT BAD FOR HIM BECAUSE I WENT TO THE ARCTIC FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS LAST YEAR TO PRODUCE A DOCK YOU SERIES WHICH IS ABOUT COME OUT AND FOR THE MOST PART, I'M BEING FILMED AS WE ARE JUST GOING ABOUT OUR DATE, BUT FOR PROMOS AND STUFF WE HAD TO DO A FEW SHOTS WHERE THEY ARE LIKE, WALK ALONG THE FJORD, WALK TOWARD THE CAMERA SLOW AND I DID IT. I FELT RIDICULOUS. TO TRUMP THAT IS WORKING. HE IS LIKE WHAT YOU MEAN, I GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF WORKING. ISN'T THAT WORK? WHAT ELSE WOULD HE BE DOING THAT WOULD HE BE READING A BRIEFING MEMO? HE DOESN'T READ. IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO THIS AND HAVE ANY CREDIBILITY AT ALL, DON'T GET ME WRONG GUYS, POLITICIANS OF ALL STRIPES TO PHOTO OPS. SOME OF THEM GO WELL COME SOMEONE DON'T, YOUR MEMBER THE PHOTO OP THAT BUSH DID DURING KATRINA WHERE HE FLEW OVER AND WAS LOOKING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE PLANE. THAT WAS A TERRIBLE PHOTO OP BUT IT WAS A PHOTO OP. OBAMA DOES THEM WELL. THE PHOTO THEY TOOK WHEN THEY WERE KILLING BIN LADEN IN THE SITUATION ROOM, THAT IS A GOLDEN PHOTO UP. THEY PLANNED TO HAVE A PHOTOGRAPHER THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE AWARE THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THAT PICTURE OUT LATER, BUT THEY DIDN'T ALL POSE. THEY WERE GOOFBALLS LIKE TRUMP GOING OKAY, HERE I AM ON THE PHONE. PROBABLY THE FOG PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK 1 MILLION PICTURES AND TOOK THE ONE THAT MADE THEM LOOK LIST AND PUT IT OUT THERE. JUST KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND HOW POLITICS WORKS BUT TRUMP CAN'T EVEN DO THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO EXAMPLES OF WHAT HE WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE IS WORKING BECAUSE HE NEVER WORKS SO EVEN THE PHOTOGRAPHER DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT TOGETHER, THE STAFFERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT TOGETHER. THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT AND IT WAS REAL, HE WOULD HAVE INVITED CONGRESSMAN TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY BE WORKING ON AN NEGOTIATION AND A DEAL AND IN THE MIDST OF THAT THEY WOULD TAKE 1000 PICTURES AND THEN TAKE ONE THAT LOOKS COOL BUT HE DIDN'T INVITE ANY CONGRESSMEN BECAUSE HE IS NOT DOING ANY WORK.
