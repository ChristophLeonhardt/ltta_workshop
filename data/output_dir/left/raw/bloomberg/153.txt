GET A RATE HIKE FROM THE FED

44
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:14,200

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:22,408
I AM ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON THE

46
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,076
BRAZILIAN CURRENCY, THE

47
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:23,776
BEST-PERFORMING AGAINST THE

00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,307

62
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,977

00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:04,784
WE WILL SEE SUPPLY BUILDUP.

65
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,651
WE'VE SEEN OIL IN THIS REGION

66
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:09,922
FOR A WHILE.

67
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:10,757
ONE MORE COMMODITY TO KEEP YOUR

68
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,592
EYE ON IS GOLD, WHICH HAD A

69
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,895
GREAT START TO THE YEAR.

70
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,064
THIS CHART POINTING OUT THAT

71
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,699
GOLD IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TWO

72
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,569
MONTH TRADING RANGE.

73
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,438
IF IT CONTINUES TO TUMBLE, KEEP

74
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,474
AN EYE ON THAT.

00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:39,952
LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE

79
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:40,553
TERMINAL.

80
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,590
WE WILL SHOW YOU THE FUNCTIONS

81
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,358

82
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,560
ACCESS THESE CHARTS.

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,330
I'M LOOKING AT A FUNCTION THAT I

84
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,031
HOPE WILL GET BIGGER FOR

85
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,833
BLOOMBERG CLIENTS.

86
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,702
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO BE

87
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,838
COMPETITIVE, NOT ONLY WITH YOUR

88
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,775
COLLEAGUES AT YOUR OWN COMPANY,

89
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:03,509
BUT WITH COLLEAGUES AT OTHER

90
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:10,750
COMPANIES AND PLACE BETS ON

91
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,820
VARIOUS THINGS.

92
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,389
THERE'S A DROP-DOWN MENU AND YOU

93
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,057
CAN PICK FROM ANY NUMBER OF DATA

94
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:18,690
POINTS THAT COME OUT.

95
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,861
JOE, YOU WILL WANT TO FOCUS ON

96
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,897
INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS, BUT

97
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,965
NONFARM PAYROLLS IS A BIG ONE

98
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,903
COMING OUT ON FRIDAY.

99
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,873
WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR THIS

100
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,242
ALREADY, 180,000 IS THE SURVEY.

101
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,076
THE LAST TIME WE BLEW OUT AND

102
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:42,982
BEAT AT 225,000.

103
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:49,188
JOE: SPEAKING OF THE JOBS

104
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,924
REPORT, A LITTLE PREVIEW THAT

105
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,792
MIGHT BE RELEVANT WITH TODAY'S

106
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,497
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX.

107
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,331
CHECK OUT THIS CHART COMPARING

108
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,799
THE LABOR DIFFERENTIAL AND X

109
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,102
VERSUS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

110
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,939
-- DIFFERENTIAL INDEX VERSUS THE

111
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,310
UNEMPLOYMENT RIGHT.

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,346
THEY SAY DO YOU PERCEIVE JOBS AS

113
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,147
HARD OR EASY TO GET RIGHT NOW?

114
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,218
THE LOWER IT GOES THAT IS THE

115
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,019
MORE THEY THINK JOBS ARE EASIER

116
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,187
TO GET.

117
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,322
WE HAVE JUST THAT THE BEST LEVEL

118
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,859
SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.

119
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,793
PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF THE LABOR

120
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,195
MARKET CONTINUES TO GET BETTER.

121
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,564
YOU CAN SEE HOW NICELY DIRECTION

122
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,265
HE TRACKS WITH THE U.S.

123
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,166
EMPLOYMENT RATE, SO WE WILL SEE

124
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,336
IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE A DECLINE

125
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:41,307
IN THE U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS

126
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,041
THAT MEASURE OF LABOR MARKET

127
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:42,708
HEALTH FROM THE SURVEY.

128
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,277
MATT: VERY COAL INDEX.

129
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,180
>> MY CHART STICKS WITH THE

130
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,318
MACRO SEEN, BUT LOOKING AT

131
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,822
CYCLICALS VERSUS DEFENSIVE.

132
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,623
I WANTED TO LOOK AT IT GLOBALLY.

133
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,192
HERE I HAVE THE FTSE CYCLICAL

134
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,296
INDEX AND WHITE AND THE FTSE

135
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,533
DEFENSIVE INDEX.

136
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,835
CYCLICAL SHARES ARE

137
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:10,603
OUTPERFORMING DEFENSIVE FOR A

138
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,605
SECOND STRAIGHT MONTH.

139
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,941
GLOBAL ECONOMIC DATA HAS BEATEN

140
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,476
FORECASTS SINCE JULY, BUT STILL

141
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:18,844
THE WORLD SHOWING THE SLOWEST

142
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,747
GROWTH RATE IN SEVEN YEARS, BUT

143
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,481
STILL SEEING THIS ROTATION

144
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:22,882
GLOBALLY.

145
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,720
THESE INDEX HAVE MEMBERS FROM

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,155
JAPAN, KOREA, SWITZERLAND.

147
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:29,922
IT IS REALLY LOOKING GLOBAL

148
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,091
HERE.

149
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,825
SINCE THE END OF JUNE, THE

150
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:37,830
CYCLICAL INDEX HAS JUMPED 9.5%,

151
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,366
WHERE AS THE DEFENSIVE ONE HAS

152
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,801
DROPPED TO 0.7%, SO THAT REALLY

153
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,769
TELLS THE STORY.

154
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,174
MATT: THESE GUYS ARE BEATING

155
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:48,908
THIS ROTATION THING TO DEATH.

156
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:56,115
JOE: OLIVER RENICK IS ONSET.

157
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,950
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS

158
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,087
SHIFT.

159
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,157
THAT'S SO OLD NEWS.

160
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,427
WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING?

161
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,194
DO PEOPLE SEE THIS TREND IS

162
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:08,794
HAVING ROOM TO RUN?

163
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,631
OLIVER: PERHAPS.

164
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,100
IT DEPENDS ON WHY YOU THINK IT

165
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:20,772
IS HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH.

166
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:21,474
THIS ONE IS POTENTIALLY

167
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,241
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF

168
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,743
THE FEW AREAS OF THE MARKET THAT

169
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,880
HAS SURVIVED, WEAKER THE PAST

170
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,117
MONTH, BUT THROUGH THE FIRST SIX

171
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,487
MONTHS, IT WAS THE ONLY PART OF

172
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,321
THE STOCK MARKET GETTING HIGHER

173
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,956
LEVELS AND HIGHER VALUATIONS, SO

174
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:42,261
IF YOU THINK THIS IS A RESULT OF

175
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,062
SPECULATION INTEREST RATES WILL

176
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,829
MOVE HIGHER AND DIVIDEND PAYING

177
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,864
COMPANIES WILL NOT BE THE HOT

178
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,801
COMMODITY TO GO AFTER, THEN THAT

179
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,436
COULD BE ONE EXPLANATION, BUT IF

180
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,040
YOU LOOK AT THE BOND MARKETS, IT

181
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,274
IS VERY INTERESTING, 30 YEAR

182
00:07:55,274 --> 00:08:01,714
SWAPS, NOW BELOW TREASURIES, SO

183
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,581
YOU BASICALLY HAVE A MARKET THAT

184
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:05,317
INDICATES EXPECTATIONS OF LOWER

185
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:05,985
RATES IN THE LONGER TERM

186
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,519
DURATION BONDS.

187
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,087
IF THAT IS THE CASE, THAT MUST

188
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,858
NOT BE AN INTEREST RATE FEW ON

189
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,692
WHAT IS HAPPENING AND DIVIDEND

190
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,493
SOCKS.

191
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,395
EITHER THE MARKETS ARE WRONG, OR

192
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,465
THESE TYPES OF COMPANIES ARE

193
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,400
DOING LESS WELL BECAUSE OF SOME

194
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,437
OTHER REASON.

195
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,906
MAYBE IT IS A VALUATION STORY, A

196
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,606
SECTOR ROTATION, CORPORATE

197
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,475
EARNINGS.

198
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:41,153
MATT: YOU COULD SEE, IF YOU'RE

199
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:41,986
GOING TO UTILITIES BECAUSE YOU

200
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:42,722
LIKE THE DIVIDENDS THEY ARE

201
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,592
PAYING, BUT EARNINGS MISSED THE

202
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,628
STREETS EXPECTATIONS BY 30% LAST

203
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,896
QUARTER, MAYBE THEY WILL HAVE TO

204
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:55,300
CUT THOSE DIVIDENDS.

205
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,135
PAYOUTS FROM TELECOMS, STAPLES,

206
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,204
AND UTILITIES, ALL THESE

207
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,038
DEFENSIVE SECTORS, BUT IT THEY

208
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,539
DON'T EARN MONEY, THEY CAN'T

209
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,675
CONTINUE TO PAY YOU THIS UNLESS

210
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,210
THEY BORROW.

211
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,944
THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE

212
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:05,377
CONCERNS.

213
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:10,883
OLIVER: THIS COMES INTO A LARGER

214
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,618
PICTURE IN THE EQUITY MARKET,

215
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,454
WHICH IS HIGH PAYOUT RATIOS,

216
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,288
PROFITS WEAKENING, BUT DIVIDENDS

217
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,089
HAVE NOT BEEN CUT.

218
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,625
WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THAT IN

219
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,861
MORE DISTRESSED AREAS, BUT WHICH

220
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,196
SECTORS ARE THE ONES THAT WILL

221
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:24,964
HAVE TO CUT DIVIDENDS IF THEY

222
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,165
NEED TO.

223
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,533
THERE ARE DIFFERENT METRICS YOU

224
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,168
CAN LOOK AT SHOWING COMPANY

225
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,936
STRETCHED IN TERMS OF THEIR CASH

226
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:31,737
LEVELS AND MOVING DOWN THE PAST

227
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,773
COUPLE OF QUARTERS, DEBT LEVELS

228
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,174
GETTING HIGH, THE FIRST THING TO

229
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,842
GO IS NOT THE DIVIDEND, BUT

230
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,880
THESE OTHER SHAREHOLDER

231
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,215
ACTIVITIES, BUYBACKS, ETC., THAT

232
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:43,949
HAVE STRETCH THE COMPANY THIN.

233
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,985
IF WE DON'T SEE THAT QUICK

234
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,187
TURNAROUND AND EARNINGS, WHICH

235
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:48,988
KEEPS GETTING PUSHED UP QUARTER

236
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,557
AND QUARTER, GUESS WHAT?

237
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,828
NOW IT'S NEGATIVE EARNINGS.

238
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,695
THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT, TO FOCUS

239
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,063
ON WHETHER THEY CAN KEEP UP TO

240
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:58,531
BEGIN WITH.

241
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,433
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

242
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,369
MULTIPLES.

243
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,437
WE HAVE DO HAVE A CHART TO SHOW

244
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,206
THEM ELEVATED HISTORICALLY AND

245
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,943
ALMOST ACROSS ALL METRICS.

246
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,744
THEY REMAIN BELOW THE REST OF

247
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:12,378
THE DEVELOPED WORLD.

248
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,448
I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL ME

249
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,483
THAT EUROPE IS ATTRACTIVE VERSUS

250
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,653
THE U.S., JAPAN IS ATTRACTIVE,

251
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,320
BUT ARE USING SOMETHING

252
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,754
DIFFERENT?

253
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,557
OLIVER: THIS IS AN INTERESTING

254
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,793
THING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE S&P,

255
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,661
NO MATTER WHAT METRIC, YOU WILL

256
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:35,835
FIND THE MARKET IS EITHER HIGHLY

257
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,635
VALUED RELATIVE TO HISTORY OR IN

258
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:41,073
ONE OF THE TOP PERCENTILES.

259
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,408
THEY WILL SHOW AN OVERVALUED

260
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,443
STOCK MARKET, BUT YOU HAVE TO

261
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,911
REMEMBER THERE IS A LOGICAL

262
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,679
EXPLANATION FOR WHY VALUATIONS

263
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,348
ARE HIGH.

264
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,149
THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS SORT OF

265
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,184
THE BEST HOUSE ON THE BLOCK.

266
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:52,885
THERE IS A MATHEMATICAL

267
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,587
CONSIDERATION YOU HAVE TO TAKE

268
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,120
INTO ACCOUNT.

269
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,657
IF YOU LOOK AT TE, THEY HAVE NOT

270
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,292
BEEN GREAT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT

271
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,595
EUROPE, THEY HAVE GOTTEN

272
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,062
DEMOLISHED.

273
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,064
IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD,

274
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,298
THE DENOMINATOR KEEPS GETTING

275
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,032
LOWER AND LOWER AND THOSE

276
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:09,035
VALUATIONS ARE VERY HIGH.

277
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:14,106
THE FTSE IS TRADING 50 TIMES.

278
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,743
IF YOU LOOK AT MARKET RELATIVE

279
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:18,677
VIBRATION COME THE S&P TRADING

280
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,914
AT 20-22 TIMES, LOWER THAN ITS

281
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,817
PEERS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD.

282
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,821
SO IT IS INTERESTING TO TRY TO

283
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,622
FIGURE OUT WHETHER VALUATIONS IN

284
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,391
THE U.S. ARE HIGH BASED ON OUR

285
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,193
OWN HISTORY, BUT AROUND THE

286
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:34,994
WORLD, THEY COULD BE ATTRACTIVE.

287
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,130
JOE: THIS CHART I HAVE BEEN

288
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,633
STARING AT THE LAST THREE DAYS,

289
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:48,007
THE SP Y ETF -- SPY ETF.

290
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,543
IT IS REMARKABLE HOW BONDS AND

291
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:52,311
STOCKS ARE MOVING AND LOCKSTEP

292
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,480
RIGHT NOW.

293
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,183
IN THE BROADER SCHEME OF THINGS,

294
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,285
THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY

295
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,119
DIVERSITY WITHIN ASSET CLASSES.

296
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:04,823
OLIVER: RIGHT, IF YOU ARE A

297
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:06,492
PORTFOLIO MANAGER, THEN YOU

298
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,359
DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR MONEY IN

299
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:07,693
CASH.

300
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,696
IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING,

301
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,563
SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHERE

302
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,998
YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IT HERE AND

303
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,568
IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO A RISKIER

304
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:17,303
PLAY, THEN MAYBE A EMERGING

305
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,838
MARKETS.

306
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:19,672
YOU WANT TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE

307
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,974
YOU GET SOME KIND OF RETURN,

308
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,444
THEN GO TO THE U.S.

309
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,514
THAT PUSHES STOCKS UP, BOND

310
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,549
YIELDS DOWN, BUT WHETHER THE

311
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,317
CORRELATION CAN STAY IN TACT

312
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:31,884
WILL BE A BIG DEAL.

313
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,551

376
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,270
UP, BACK AROUND 13, A SUPPORT

377
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,440
LEVEL.

378
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,344
IT DID BELOW, AND NOW BACK UP.

379
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,314
AS YOU HEAD INTO SEASONALITY IN

380
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:34,052
SEPTEMBER, BREXIT, YOU HAVE A

381
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:39,558
CHANCE TO SEE VIX SPIKE UP, BOND

382
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,263
YIELDS CREEP UP GLOBALLY, AND

383
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,364
THESE BOND PROXY STOCKS,

384
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,999
UTILITIES, DIVIDEND STOCKS,

385
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:52,271
SMALL OUTFLOWS, UNDERPERFORMING,

386
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,872
AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

387
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:54,673
HAVE SUPPORTED THE EQUITY MARKET

388
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,140
ARE NOT THERE.

389
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,776
>> THAT IS LIKE THE THEME OF THE

390
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,477
WEEK FOR US HERE.

391
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,948
>> THE DEATH OF THE SAFETY

392
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,782
STOCKS.

393
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,484
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

394
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,654
IT COULDN'T IT BE THAT THE

395
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,589
ECONOMY IS IMPROVING AND THINKS

396
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,390
OF BETTER SO WE NO LONGER NEED

397
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,757
TO HIDE?

398
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:18,697
>> THERE IS SOME RELEVANT --

399
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,264
ELEMENT TO THAT.

400
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,399
YOU ARE SEEING A RUSH INTO BETA,

401
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,602
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOSE THIS

402
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,336
AS THE LAST BASTION IN THE

403
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,938
EQUITY MARKET.

404
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,672
THEY DID NOT WANT TO OWN

405
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,774
EQUITIES, BUT NOT THE DIVIDEND

406
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,809
STOCKS.

407
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,978
AS YIELDS GO HIGHER AND THEY GET

408
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:33,812
NERVOUS, I THINK THEY WILL WANT

409
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,782
TO GO OUT OF THAT.

410
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,984
I THINK THE NEXT EXODUS IS OUT

411
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,854
OF THE STOCK MARKET COMPLETELY.

412
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:47,092
IF THEY GIVE UP THAT, THEY ARE

413
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:47,893
SELLING THE EQUITY MARKETS, AND

414
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,593
THAT WILL CREATE PRESSURE.

415
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:51,964
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THIS HUNT FOR

416
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,533
YIELD, AND ONE THING YOU TALK

417
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,300
ABOUT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES

418
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,135
PRESENTED BY THE INCREASING

419
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,170
LIBOR.

420
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,074
A GREAT COLUMN ABOUT HOW THE FED

421
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,109
ACTUALLY HAS NOT PAID A LOT OF

422
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:04,876
ATTENTION TO THE PROSPECTS OF

423
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,045
THIS RISING, SO HOW ARE YOU

424
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:07,546
PLAYING THIS?

425
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:12,317
>> WE LIKE THE LEVERAGED LOAN

426
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,051
SPACE, THE HIGH-YIELD BOND

427
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,154
EQUIVALENT, SO FLOATING RATES.

428
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,557
YOU ARE STARTING TO CREEP ABOVE

429
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,627
75, AN INCREASE IN RATES,

430
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,862
STEPPING UP THE CAPITAL

431
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,197
STRUCTURE, SO I PREFERRED THAT

432
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:25,797
ELEMENT OF SAFETY.

433
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,801
WITHIN THAT, THERE ARE CLOSE IN

434
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:33,872
THE FUNDS, ETF'S, SO YOU HAVE

435
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:39,177
SOME UPSIDE IF YIELDS DO RISE,

436
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,046
AND A LOT OF PROTECTION BECAUSE

437
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,516
THE LIBOR MOVE IS ISOLATED.

438
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,151
WERE ALSO LOOKING AT FLOATING

439
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,619
RATE IN BONDS, CITIBANK CAME OUT

440
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,353
WITH A SEVEN-YEAR FLOATER.

441
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,057
THERE ARE CORPORATE FLOATERS,

442
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:56,295
ETF FLT, SO YOU'RE NOT GIVING UP

443
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,430
MUCH TO AVOID INTEREST RATE

444
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:04,035
RISK.

445
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:04,870
THAT TRADE-OFF MAKES SENSE TO

446
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,203
ME.

447
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:10,742
JOE: DOES THIS ADVANTAGE PEOPLE

448
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:11,743
LOOKING FOR DIVERSIFICATION AND

449
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,277
PORTFOLIOS.

450
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,814
I'M LOOKING AT THE DEGREE TO

451
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:16,815
WHICH EQUITIES AND TREASURIES

452
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,952
SEEM TO BE MOVING IN LOCKSTEP.

453
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,619
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO

454
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,853
DIVERSIFICATION.

455
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,754
FRIDAY WAS ONE OF THE WORST DAYS

456
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,290
IN A LONG TIME FOR THE

457
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,361
MULTI-STRATEGY INDICES THAT WAS

458
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,931
A STRONG VERY.

459
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,899
DOES THE STRATEGY YOU REPRESENT

460
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,566
OFFER ALTERNATIVES?

461
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,971
>> IT WILL BEHAVE MORE

462
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,672
UNCORRELATED. MOVING INTO LIBOR

463
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,841
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS

464
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,643
RISE, WHICH IS TECHNICAL AND

465
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,478
WONKY, BUT WILL BE MAINSTREAM

466
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,715
AND HIT PEOPLE IF THEY SEE THEIR

467
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,616
MORTGAGES GO UP, SO IT'S A GREAT

468
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,852
WAY TO GET YIELD AND DIVERSIFY

469
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,854
AWAY FROM FIXED INCOME.

470
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:00,025
MATT: WE ARE LOOKING FOR A GAIN

471
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,294
OF 180,000.

472
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,094
WE GOT A BLOWOUT NUMBER LAST

473
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,930
MONTH.

474
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,265
IF WE GET A BLOWOUT NUMBER THIS

475
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:07,966
MONTH, DOES THE FED GO IN

476
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,366
SEPTEMBER?

477
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:14,172
>> I THINK THERE IS A DECENT

478
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:14,940
CHANCE TO GO EVEN IF WE GET A

479
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,109
DECENT NUMBER.

480
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,377
THE AUGUST REPORT IS TYPICALLY

481
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:20,912
DISAPPOINTING, SO IF WE, IN

482
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,214
LINE, THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH.

483
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,550
WHERE I DIFFER IS THAT THE FED

484
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,419
SPENT SO MUCH TIME PUTTING JUNE

485
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,289
ON THE TABLE, THEN DIDN'T RAISE.

486
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,457
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS COMING INTO

487
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,291
JUNE, WE HAD BAD DATA AFTER BAD

488
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,426
DATA.

489
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:39,498
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

490
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,398
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE THE

491
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:45,270
EXACT OFFICE -- OPPOSITE.

492
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,073
THERE ARE SIGNS OF INFLATION,

493
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,975
JOBS THERE, SO I WOULD NOT BE

494
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,742
SURPRISED TO SEE A SEPTEMBER

495
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,443
HIKE IF WE GET A GOOD JOBS

496
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:51,843
REPORT.

497
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,246
JOE: THAT WAS PETER CHEER.

498
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:59,618
MATT: COMING UP, THERE'S RETURN

499
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,185
TO THE MARKET.

500
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:05,524
WE HAVE THE CHART YOU CAN'T

501
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:05,991
MISS, NEXT.

502
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,525
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

503
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:06,858
â™ª

504
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:35,474
MATT: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

505
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,309
WHY MATT MILLER.

506
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,346
THE YUAN BEARS HAVE RETURNED.

507
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,483
I FORGET MY CHART NUMBER.

508
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,551
3123, THANK YOU.

509
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:52,790
THAT IS WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR.

510
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,625
I HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT LOOKS

511
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:58,730
AT THE YUAN BEARS.

512
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,564
THIS ONE SHOWS YOU THE THREE

513
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,233
MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND THE

514
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,503
SPOT PRICE AND BLUE.

515
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,005
AS THE LINE GOES UP, THE YUAN

516
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,609
GETS WEAKER.

517
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,777
THREE MONTH VOLATILITY IN AUGUST

518
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,545
HAS CLIMBED AT A FASTER RATE

519
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,882
THAN ANY MONTH SINCE JANUARY.

520
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,717
BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU CAN SEE

521
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,420
TRADERS THINK THE YUAN COULD GET

522
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,723
WILDER.

523
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,958
YOU COULD LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

524
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,692
PUTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

525
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,961
CALLS RIGHT NOW.

526
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,829
THE FORWARD CONTRACTS TRADED AT

527
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,364
A DISCOUNT TO THE SPOT PRICE.

528
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,567
ALL THESE THINGS INDICATE THAT

529
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,402
EVERYONE EXPECTS THE YUAN TO

530
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:37,802
WEAKEN.

531
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:42,874
JOE: THERE IS A VOLATILITY

532
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,241
PICKUP.

533
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,811
THE S&P 500 OR MARKETS DON'T

534
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,381
RESPOND TO THE WEAKENING

535
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,181
CURRENCY, BUT DO RESPOND TO A

536
00:25:50,181 --> 00:26:00,124
SPIKE IN VOLATILITY.

537
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,027
SPEAKING OF THE CHINA STORY, I

538
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,929
WANT TO LOOK AT MY FAVORITE DATA

539
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:05,697
POINT, WHICH COMES OUT LATER

540
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,397
THIS WEEK, MACCALLUM GAMING

541
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,999
REVENUE.

542
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:14,105
-- MACAU GAMING REVENUE.

543
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,474
YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE, ONLY DOWN

544
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:21,446
BY 7.1%, COMPARED TO WHERE WE

545
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,181
WERE, WE ARE ONE POINT DOWN ON

546
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:31,122
GDP, 23% DOWN GDP LAST YEAR, SO

547
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,692
THIS IS QUITE A COMEBACK.

548
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,459
THE BLUE BAR CHART IS GAMING

549
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,727
REVENUE.

550
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,528
WE WILL GET THAT LATER THIS

551
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,596
WEEK.

552
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,566
THAT HAS ALSO BEEN IMPROVING.

553
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,434
ANIMAL SPIRITS AND THE HEALTH OF

554
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,904
THE EMERGING MARKETS, YOU CAN

555
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:46,738
SEE HOW THAT TRACKS THE GENERAL

556
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,473
SHAPE OF EMERGING MARKETS, SO

557
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,174
DEEP AND I ON THOSE GAMING

558
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,508
REVENUE NUMBERS.

559
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:54,712
-- AN EYE ON THOSE GAMING

560
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:55,246
REVENUE NUMBERS.

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,933
.5% OF GDP.

749
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,901
THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

750
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,938
GO IN INCREMENTAL STEPS.

751
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:47,805
THERE ARE TWO BILLS THAT NEED TO

752
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:52,743
BE SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS, AN

753
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,544
AMENDMENT TO CAP THE GROWTH OF

754
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,781
PRIMARY SPENDING.

755
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,849
THE HOPE IS THAT WILL CLEAR

756
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,583
CONGRESS WITH NOT TOO MANY

757
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:03,054
LOOPHOLES.

758
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,821
THE SECOND ONE IS A STRONG

759
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,756
SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM THAT

760
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:10,027
IMPROVES THE CHURCH A TREE FOR

761
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:10,828
THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM.

762
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:16,000
MORE THAN THAT, WE NEED THE

763
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,834
GOVERNMENT TO STOP ACCOMMODATING

764
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,668
DEMANDS FOR ADDITIONAL SPENDING

765
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,302
FOR INTEREST GROUPS.

766
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:23,040
JOE: IF YOU LOOK IN THE

767
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,841
TERMINAL, I'M LOOKING AT THE

768
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:28,045
BRAZIL MISERY INDEX, A CRUDE WAY

769
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:28,946
OF LOOKING AT THE PAIN IN THE

770
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,048
ECONOMY, ADDING THE INFLATION

771
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,716
RATE TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE,

772
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:37,621
EXTREMELY HIGH.

773
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,489
THE YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO

774
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,092
THESE EXPANSIONARY AUSTERITY

775
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,196
THEORIES THAT GOVERNMENTS IN A

776
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:45,996
DEEP ALL NEED TO CUT SPENDING.

777
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:50,634
WHEN YOU LOOK AT EUROPE, WHY ARE

778
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:51,435
YOU CONFIDENT THAT IS THE RIGHT

779
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,236
PRESCRIPTION?

780
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,506
IT'S A CRUDE WAY OF SHOWING HOW

781
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,207
PAINFUL THE SITUATION IS.

782
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:01,011
>> THIS IS A REFLECTION OF THE

783
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,379
IMBALANCES THAT HAVING HUMAN

784
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:06,517
RELATED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

785
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,318
YOU END UP WITH INFLATION AND

786
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:11,589
DOUBLE DIGITS IN 2015.

787
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,423
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT

788
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,259
EXPANDED WAY TOO MUCH.

789
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,195
THE FEAR THAT ON THIS PATH WE

790
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:23,167
WILL GO INTO FISCAL

791
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:27,371
UNSUSTAINABLE SITUATIONS.

792
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,573
IT'S KEY TO RECOVER CONFIDENCE.

793
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:34,545
WE HAVE SEEN DEPRESSED LEVELS OF

794
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,013
CONSUMER AND BUSINESS

795
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,147
CONFIDENCE, AND PART OF THAT WAS

796
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:38,716
RELATED TO THE MASSIVE FISCAL

797
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,450
EXPANSION IN RECENT YEARS.

798
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,087
>> YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREAT ASK

799
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,722
AHEAD FOR THESE PHYSICAL CHANGES

800
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,590

802
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:52,596

THE MARKET POINT -- AND BUOYANT

805
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,639
-- BUOYANT?

806
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:16,120
>> WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF

807
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,954
THESE MEASURES ARE POLITICALLY

808
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,623
SENSITIVE AND UNPOPULAR, BUT

809
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,457
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE NOT

810
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:20,991
NEEDED.

811
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,128
THEY ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED.

812
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:24,995
ONCE THE IMPEACHMENT CLEARS, THE

813
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,832
MARKET WILL BE FOCUSING ON THE

814
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,567

820
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,451

MUCH MORE TO THIS?

873

874
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:09,213
WE HAVE MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION

00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:22,826
PUBLIC CONSUMPTION AND

BY THE LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE

00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,431

OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT GROWTH

DOES IT NEED TO WEAKEN MORE TO

00:44:59,196 --> 00:44:59,930
HELP BRING THE ECONOMY INTO

899
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:00,297
BALANCE?

900
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,833
>> YES AND NO.

901
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:03,834
SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE RELATED

902
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:09,106

903
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:13,143

LUNCH.

905
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,846

INFLATION, NOW RUNNING ABOVE

907
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,082

THE CENTRAL BANK TO INCREASE THE

909

910
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,823
WE HAVE A BEARISH VIEW ON COPPER

GROW LESS THAN 2% THIS YEAR.

914
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:39,269
IT IS A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH

915
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:39,937
DEPRECIATION YOU NEED.

916
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:44,708

00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:57,988
HOW KEY IS THIS FOR CHILE'S

924
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:03,794
>> IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT.

925
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:04,628
IT IS NOT THE OVERRIDING CONCERN

926
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,631

934
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:32,889

00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:37,094
CONSOLIDATION.

938
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:42,866
WHAT IS CHILE'S FISCAL PICTURE

939
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:43,600
AND DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE

940
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,101
POLICY LEVERS?

941
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,903
>> IT IS NOT AS DRAMATIC AS

942
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:48,772
BRAZIL.

943
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:52,075
THE PUBLIC DEBT IS LOWER AND THE

944
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:52,876
CARRYING COST OF THAT DEBT IS

945
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,178
LOWER.

946
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,078
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THAT

947
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,847
DEBT AT MUCH LOWER REAL INTEREST

948
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:57,915
RATES.

949
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,517
THE CAPACITY TO USE THE BUDGET

950
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,518
IN AN EXPANSIONARY WAY IS

951
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,920
LIMITED.

952
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,924
YOU ALSO NEED TO EVOLVE ONCE YOU

953
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:11,094
ACCOMMODATE.

954
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,763
THE TREND OVER THE MEDIUM-TERM

955
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:16,166
SHOULD BE TOWARDS LOWER DEFICITS

956
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,000
AS WELL.

957
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,371
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

958
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:21,705
US.

959
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,941
MATT: APPLE IS ORDERED TO PAY

960
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,177
MORE THAN $14 BILLION PLUS

961
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,548
INTEREST IN A THREE-YEAR EU

962
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:32,382
CRACKDOWN AGAINST CORPORATE TAX

963
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,051
AVOIDANCE.

964
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,386
WE WILL BREAK DOWN THE DECISION

965
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:37,421
AND IRELAND'S REACTION.

966
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,522
DO THEY EVEN WANT THE MONEY?

967
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,156
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

968
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:39,456
â™ª

969
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:07,137
>> "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

970
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:07,938
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS

971
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:11,775
ORDERED APPLE TO PAY MORE THAN

972
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:12,576
$14 BILLION PLUS INTEREST IN A

973
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:16,913
TAX CASE.

974
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:19,015
IT IS THE LARGEST TAX PENALTY IN

975
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,083
A THREE-YEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST

976
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,885
CORPORATE TAX AVOIDANCE.

977
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,754
APPLE AND IRELAND ABOUT TO FIGHT

978
00:50:24,754 --> 00:50:30,259
THE DECISION.

979
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:31,127
WE ASKED IF THEY ARE STRETCHING

980
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,997
RULES RIGHT USING THEM TO

981
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:34,631
ENFORCE NEW TAX LAWS.

982
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:38,368
>> NOT AT ALL.

983
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,202
TAXATION IS A MATTER FOR MEMBER

984
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:43,306
STATES.

985
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,975
NO MEMBER STATES CAN GIVE OUT

986
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,245
SELECTIVE BENEFITS TO A COMPANY.

987
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,045
IT IS A LONG-STANDING PRACTICE

988
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:53,917
THAT GOES BACK TO THE 1950'S.

989
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,052
IN THAT RESPECT, THERE IS NO

990
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,455
NOVELTIES HERE.

991
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,322
THIS IS THE WORK WE ARE SUPPOSED

992
00:50:59,322 --> 00:50:59,689
TO DO.

993
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:03,593
>> THERE IS DISAPPOINTMENT FROM

994
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,327
BOTH PARTIES AND THE U.S.

995
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,062
TREASURY.

996
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,265
LET ME READ TO YOU WHAT THEY

997
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:08,665
SAID.

998
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,366
THE TREASURY IS DISAPPOINTED

999
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:12,436
THAT THE COMMISSION IS ACTING

1000
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,236
UNILATERALLY AND THE PARTING

1001
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,639
FROM THE IMPORTANT PROGRESS THAT

1002
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,073
THE U.S. COME THE EU, AND THE

1003
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:20,143
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE

1004
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:20,877
MADE TOGETHER TO COMBAT TAX

1005
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,412
AVOIDANCE.

1006
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,280
WHY DID YOU FEEL THE NEED TO ACT

1007
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,319
UNILATERALLY WHEN THE OCD HAS

1008
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,086
MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS OVER THE

1009
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:30,654
LAST THREE YEARS?

1010
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:35,759
>> THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

1011
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,660
POINT, THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE

1012
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,197
OVER THE LAST YEAR.

1013
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:41,931
IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, NEW

1014
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:42,732
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED

1015
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,301
AND PASSED AND IS NOW BEING

1016
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,604
IMPLEMENTED.

1017
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,706
THAT IS ALL GOOD AND FINE

1018
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,473
BECAUSE IT MAKES THE GLOBAL

1019
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:53,109
TAXATION MUCH FAIRER IN THE

1020
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:57,380
FUTURE AND TAXATION AS SUCH MORE

1021
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:57,881
TRANSPARENT.

1022
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:02,152
THE CASE HERE IS SPECIFIC.

1023
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:02,886
WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING

1024
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:03,620
PROHIBITION OF MEMBER STATES

1025
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,957
HANDING OUT BENEFITS OR

1026
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,624
ADVANTAGES TO SPECIFIC

1027
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,592
COMPANIES.

1028
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:12,729
THIS IS THE CASE HERE, MORE THAN

1029
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,430
IT IS A CASE OF TAXATION.

1030
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,598
THESE BENEFITS CAN COME IN THE

1031
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:18,268
FORM OF A CHEAP PIECE OF LAND, A

1032
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:22,606
GENEROUS LOAN, A GRANT, OR A TAX

1033
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:25,942
BENEFIT, AND THAT IS THE CASE

1034
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:26,776
HERE, MUCH MORE THAN IT IS A

1035
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,678
CASE OF INTERFERING IN THE VERY

1036
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,481
GOOD WORK DONE BY THE OECD OR

1037
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,851
G-20.

1038
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:40,991
MATT: IRELAND ALSO PLANS TO

1039
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:41,791
FIGHT THE RULING.

1040
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,627
EARLIER TODAY ON BLOOMBERG, THE

1041
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:46,996
IRISH FINANCE MINISTER REJECTED

1042
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:47,831
ARGUMENTS THAT APPLE IS GETTING

1043
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,465
SPECIAL TREATMENT.

1044
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:54,104
>> WE DON'T MANAGE HOW APPLE

1045
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:54,804
ORGANIZES THEIR AFFAIRS.

1046
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:55,505
WE TAX THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

1047
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,842
THAT MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES

1048
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,944
CARRY OUT IN IRELAND.

1049
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,880
IF THERE WERE ANY RANGED IN'S

1050
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,647
MADE BEYOND IRISH LAW AND THE

1051
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:07,284
COMPETENCE OF THE IRISH TAX

1052
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,118
AUTHORITIES AND AN ARGUMENT IS

1053
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:08,952
BEING MADE THAT APPLE DOES NOT

1054
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:14,391
PAY ENOUGH TAX, THEN IT IS A

1055
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:18,762
MATTER FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

1056
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:19,562
THE COMMISSIONER IN HER PRESS

1057
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:20,363
STATEMENT TODAY HAS ACKNOWLEDGE

1058
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,199
THAT.

1059
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,068
SHE SAID SOME OF THE TAXI IS

1060
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:25,835
ATTRIBUTING TO IRELAND MAY BE

1061
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,636
DUE TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

1062
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:30,206
AND ADVISES THEM TO LOOK FOR THE

1063
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,474
ATTACKS.

1064
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:32,242
SHE ALSO SAYS THAT IF APPLE

1065
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,978
WANTS TO MAKE AN ALTERNATIVE

1066
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,080
ARRANGEMENT WITH U.S.

1067
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,747
AUTHORITIES IN TERMS OF

TRANSFERRING PROFITS TO RESEARCH

1069
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,486
AND DEVELOP MEN COSTS, THEN THEY

1070
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,256
SHOULD DO THAT, SO BY HER OWN

1071
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,056
PRESS STATEMENT, SHE ADMITS THE

1072
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:49,325
LIABILITY MAY NOT BE IN IRELAND

1073
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:49,993
AT ALL, BUT ELSEWHERE.

1074
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:56,299
>> MORE THAN 700 U.S. COMPANIES

1075
00:53:56,299 --> 00:54:00,370
EMPLOY 40,000 PEOPLE IN IRELAND.

1076
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,506
WILL THIS DAMAGE INVESTMENT,

1077
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:03,873
JOBS?

1078
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,542
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO U.S.

1079
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,276
COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN

1080
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:06,776
IRELAND TODAY?

1081
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:11,114
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHEN THE

1082
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:11,881
EUROPEAN COMMISSION WITH THE

1083
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:12,515
ASSISTANCE OF THE IRISH

1084
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,483
AUTHORITIES WERE RESEARCHING THE

1085
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:18,388
APPLE CASE, THEY LOOKED AT

1086
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,189
ALMOST 100 COMPANIES, AND MOST

1087
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,724
OF THE SIGNIFICANT AMERICAN

1088
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:22,559
INVESTORS IN IRELAND WERE LOOKED

1089
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,562
AT, AND THE COMMISSION HAVE COME

1090
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,330
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ONLY

1091
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:33,536
POSSIBLE CASE IS THE CASE THEY

1092
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,504
ARE PROSECUTING AGAINST APPLE,

1093
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,573
SO THERE IS NO CONTAGION EFFECT.

1094
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,709
ALL I AM SAYING IS THAT WE DON'T

1095
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,311
THINK THIS DECISION IS VALID AND

1096
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,946
WE WILL APPEAL THIS DECISION AND

1097
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:43,780
WE ARE SAYING THAT WE WILL STAND

1098
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,816
BY THOSE COMPANIES THAT INVEST

1099
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:49,653
IN IRELAND AND WE WILL APPLY THE

1100
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,454
TAX REGIME APPLICABLE UNDER

1101
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:57,594
IRISH LAW AND WE HAVE ASSURANCES

1102
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,462
FROM MANY OF THEM THAT THEY WILL

1104
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:01,598

THAT IS HARDER.

1207
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,111
