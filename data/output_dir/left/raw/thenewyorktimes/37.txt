1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
This whole two-week effort

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,480
has been a calculated and
orchestrated political hit,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,440
fueled with apparent pent-up
anger about President Trump

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,090
and the 2016 election,

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,580
fear that has been
unfairly stoked

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,830
about my judicial record,

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,880
revenge on behalf
of the Clintons,

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,990
and millions of dollars
in money from outside,

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,830
left-wing opposition groups.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,590
This is a circus.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,030
The consequences will extend
long past my nomination.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,050
The consequences will
be with us for decades.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,730
This grotesque and coordinated
character assassination

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,450
will dissuade confident
and good people

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,690
of all political persuasions
from serving our country.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,750
And as we all know,
in the United States

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,360
political system
of the early 2000s,

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,030
what goes around
comes around.

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,950
I am an optimistic guy.

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,430
I always try to be on the
sunrise side of the mountain,

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,880
to be optimistic about
the day that is coming.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,810
But today I have to say
that I fear for the future.

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,720
Last time I was here,
I told this committee

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,400
that a federal judge
must be independent,

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,490
not swayed by public
or political pressure.

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,930
I said I was such a judge.

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,610
And I am.

28
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,790
I will not be intimidated into
withdrawing from this process.

29
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,130
You’ve tried hard.

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,200
You’ve given it your all.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,870
No one can question
your effort.

32
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,100
But your coordinated
and well-funded effort

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,440
to destroy my good name
and destroy my family

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,230
will not drive me out.

35
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,650
The vile threats of violence
against my family

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,270
will not drive me out.

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,480
You may defeat me
in the final vote,

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,670
but you’ll never
get me to quit.

39
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,070
Never.

40
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,970
I’m here today
to tell the truth.

41
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,580
I’ve never sexually
assaulted anyone,

42
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,140
not in high school,
not in college, not ever.

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,390
Sexual assault is horrific.

44
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,370
One of my closest
friends to this day

45
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,610
is a woman who was
sexually abused

46
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,640
and who in the 1990s,
when we were in our 30s,

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,290
confided in me about the abuse
and sought my advice.

48
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,240
I was one of the only
people she consulted.

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,060
Allegations of sexual assault
must always

50
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,000
be taken seriously — always.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,150
Those who make allegations
always deserve to be heard.

52
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,730
At the same time,
the person who

53
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,840
is the subject of
the allegations

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,870
also deserves to be heard.

55
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,570
Due process is a foundation
of the American rule of law.

56
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,940
Due process means
listening to both sides.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,360
I’m not questioning
that Dr. Ford may

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,690
have been sexually
assaulted by some person

59
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,620
in some place
at some time.

60
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,160
But I have never done this —
to her or to anyone.

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,350
That’s not who I am.

62
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,930
It is not who I was.

63
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,620
I am innocent of this charge.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,240
I intend no ill will to
Dr. Ford and her family.

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,630
The other night Ashley
and my daughter Liza

66
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,090
said their prayers

67
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,860
and little Liza,
all of 10 years old,

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,770
said to Ashley, “We should
pray for the woman.”

69
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,730
It’s a lot of wisdom
from a 10-year-old.

70
00:04:00,500 --> 00:00:00,000
We mean —
we mean no ill will.
