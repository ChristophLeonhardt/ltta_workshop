THAT TOO.
>>LELAND: ALISO FAR THEY DON'T
BUT WE WILL SEE IF YOU AND YOUR
COLLEAGUES CAN CONVINCE THEM.
CONGRESSMAN, I APPRECIATE YOU
BEING HERE.
>>ELIZABETH: PRESIDENT TRUMP
BOWING TO BRING DOWN
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES ON
FRIDAY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OPENLY
CRITICAL ABOUT HIGH DRUG PRICES
IN THE PAST BUT HIS SPEECH
FRIDAY FOCUSED LESS ON HIS
POPULIST MESSAGE AND MORE ON
WORKING TO FIX THE PROBLEM
WITHIN THE PHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRY ITSELF.
LET'S BRING IN OUR FAIR AND
BALANCED POLITICAL PANEL.
- - IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
GREAT AMERICA PACK
GREAT AMERICA PACK.
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING ME.
ERIC, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.
SUCCESS OR NOT A SUCCESS.
WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THE REACTION
FROM SOME OF THESE DRUG
COMPANIES, THEY ARE NOT REALLY
UP IN ARMS SO I'M WONDERING IF
THIS IS A SUCCESS HERE.
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE
PRESIDENT A GREAT AMOUNT OF
RESPECT FOR TACKLING AN ISSUE
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST
STRATEGY FOR REPUBLICANS.
HE REALLY JUST LET THE HEALTH
INDUSTRY DIE AND GO AWAY.
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS LOWER
THE DRUG PRICES FOR SENIORS.
HE WANTS TO MAKE OTHER
COUNTRIES PAY MORE.
ALSO, WE HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST
DRUG COST IN THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY.
I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS
HE CAMPAIGNED ON THAT HE WISHES
TO DELIVER BUT I THINK HE
REALIZES HE NEEDS TO WORK WITH
- - TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES
OCCUR.
HE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE HE'S
ATTACKING THIS PROBLEM INSIDE
OUT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT
HE'S DOING.
>>ELIZABETH: DAVID, I WANT TO
GET YOUR TAKE ON IT.
ONE THING ERIC SAID WAS TO LET
IT DIE.
WITH THAT BEHOOVE, WHO?
>> I THINK YESTERDAY'S
ANNOUNCEMENT IS PRETTY SIMPLE
IN TERMS OF WHO BENEFITS.
IT BENEFITS PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANIES AT THE EXTENSIVE
SENIORS.
PRESIDENTS SAID CLEARLY HE
WANTED MEDICARE TO BE ALLOWED
TO NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.
YESTERDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT, NOT
ONLY DID HE NOT ANNOUNCE THAT
BUT IT WAS A BETRAYAL OF THAT
PROMISE.
HE BROKE FAITH WITH AMERICANS
SENIORS.
>>ELIZABETH: ERICA WANT YOUR
REACTION AND THEN WE WILL MOVE
ON.
>> I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT
IS TRYING TO DO IS HE'S TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WORK ON
REAL REFORMS THAT HE CAMPAIGNED
ON.
WE TRIED TO DO IT THE
CONGRESSIONAL BODY.
HOPEFULLY THIS IS SOMETHING
BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
CAN GET BEHIND.
>>ELIZABETH: I WANT TO TAKE
MORE OF A MACRO VIEW TO TAKE A
LOOK AT SOME OF THE MOVES THE
PRESIDENT HAS MADE.
HE'S BEEN REMARKABLY CONSISTENT
ON ATTEMPTING AT LEAST ALL OF
HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES.
FROM OBAMACARE, ROLLING BACK
THE MANDATE.
BUILDING A WALL.
NOT GETTING EVERYTHING HE
WANTED.
REDUCING IMMIGRATION FROM
TERROR PRONE COUNTRIES.
YOU CAN'T FAULT HIM FOR
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE
PROMISES HE MADE POINT I AM
CURIOUS AS TO YOUR TAKE 18
MONTHS INTO THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE
CRITICAL OF THAT BUT HE'S BEEN
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THESE
PROMISES.
>> THANKS FOR LEADING WITH THE
BIG REVEAL THERE.
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE TALKS
A BIG GAME AND THEN EFFECTIVE
GAME.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HIS OWN BEST
MESSENGER.
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE MESSAGING.
TAKING A STEP BACK.
I THINK THE CORE PROMISE OF HIS
CAMPAIGN TO PEOPLE WHO VOTED
FOR HIM WAS THAT HE WAS GOING
TO LOOK OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY.
THE PERSON WHO FELT LEFT BEHIND
BY CHANGING ECONOMY.
I HAVE TO ASK FOR VOTERS THAT
VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW
DO YOU FEEL WHEN THE TAX CUT HE
PUSHED THROUGH,
DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFITS THE
RICHEST ONE PERCENT OF THE
COUNTRY AT YOUR EXPENSE?
YOU MENTIONED THE WALL POINT HE
SAYS REPEATEDLY, MEXICO IS
GOING TO PAY FOR THIS WALL.
HE HAD A CHANCE TO FUND THE
WALL
HE HAD A CHANCE TO FUND THE
WALL IN THE PACKAGE HE PUSHED
THROUGH.
YET, HE REFUSED TO FUND THE
WALL.
HE FAILED.
THERE IS NO FUNDING FOR THE
WALL AND MEXICO WILL NOT PAY.
I THINK WHILE HE TALKS A GOOD
GAME, THERE'S A CONSISTENT
PATTERN OF THOUGHT OF SAYING
ONE THING AND FAILING TO
DELIVER.
>>ELIZABETH: YOU HAVE TWO
PLACES YOU CAN RESPOND.
>> RESULTS MATTER.
THIS PRESIDENT HAS HAD ENORMOUS
AND GREAT RESULTS.
HE'S DECLINED THE REGULATIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN HAMPERING SMALL
BUSINESSES AROUND THE COUNTRY.
TARIFF TAX WASN'T VERY POPULAR.
BUT THE MARKET - - I THINK WHEN
HE LOOKS AT AMERICA FIRST
POLICIES BE JUST LIKE
HEALTHCARE FROM YESTERDAY, THE
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
HE'S NOT AFRAID TO TACKLE
PROBLEMS HE TALKED ABOUT DURING
THE CAMPAIGN.
HE DOESN'T CARE IF IT'S BEST
FOR REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS.
HE WAS THERE TO BRING ON REAL
REFORMS AND YOU'VE GOT TO
RESPECT HIM IN TERMS OF HIS
AGENDA AND WHAT HE'S DOING.
LASTLY, YOU TALK ABOUT BUILDING
A WALL.
THIS IS A PRESIDENT, WE HAVE
THINGS IN THE COURT RIGHT NOW
TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN
TERMS OF OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE
