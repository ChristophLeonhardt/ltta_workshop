63
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:50,458

64
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,859
THAT'S HOW HE DOES IT.

65
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,262
IT IS A BIG NEWS STORY.

66
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:57,031
THE 17th AMERICAN BY MY COUNT

THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS FREED

68
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,201
FROM FOREIGN CAPTIVITY.

69
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,736
FOUR AMERICANS IN NORTH KOREA,

70
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,237
AMERICAN AID WORK THEY'RE JIPT,

71
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,705
THROUGH UCLA BASKETBALL PLAYERS,

72
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:06,941
AND A TEXAS BUSINESSWOMAN IN

73
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:09,577

00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,846
OFFICIAL IN PR TO YOU GAL,

AMERICAN CITIZEN HELD IN

76
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:14,449
VENEZUELA.

77
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,316
HE'S DOING INTEREST FAIRLY

78
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:17,018
CONSISTENTLY.

79
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,821
HE'S DONE INTEREST NOT BY GIVING

80
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:22,790
BRIBES, NOT BY SENDING PLANE

81
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,092
LOADS OF CASH TO FOREIGN REGIMES

82
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,560
THAT, CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO

83
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,028
TAKE AMERICANS HOSTAGE.

84
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:29,530
HE EXERCISES THE COERCIVE

85
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:30,898
ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC POWER OF

86
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,400
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

87
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,969
HE PUT CRUSHING SANCTIONS ON

88
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,271
TURKEY, SENT THE LIRA TUMBLING.

89
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:39,841
TURKEY FOUND A WAY TO GET OUT OF

90
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:40,108
IT.

91
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,676
>> AND THEY HAD ALSO MADE IT,

92
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,077
THE ADMINISTRATION MADE IT

93
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:44,712
PRETTY CLEAR THAT, THIS WAS

94
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:45,413
NECESSARY FOR IMPROVING

95
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,848
RELATIONS.

96
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,351
THE TIMING IS INTERESTING.

97
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,153
GIVEN THAT TURKEY HAS ALSO BEEN

98
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:54,956
TURNING OVER A LOT OF

99
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,857
INTELLIGENCE ON THE POSSIBLE

100
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:59,393
APPARENT MURDER OF OUR

101
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:00,728
COLLEAGUE, JAMAL KHASHOGGI, FROM

102
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:01,963
THE "WASHINGTON POST."

103
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,397
TURKEY COULD BE PLAYING SORT OF

104
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:06,300
A DOUBLE GAME HERE, TO SORT OF

105
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,869
POSITION ITSELF IN ITS RIVALRY

106
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,437
WITH SAUDI ARABIA.

107
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,706
>> Bret: MATTHEW?

108
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,541
>> THERE ARE REAL ECONOMIC COSTS

109
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,510
TO THE CAPTIVITY OF RECEIVE

110
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,379
BRUNSON, NO -- REV. BRUNSON.

111
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,414
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S METHOD IS

112
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:21,816
LEVERAGE THE ECONOMIC WEIGHT OF

113
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:22,583
THE UNITED STATES AGAINST

114
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:23,784
REGIMES DOING NO GOOD.

115
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:26,420
THIS IS A VICTORY, NOT ONLY FOR

116
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:27,855
THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO

117
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,357
VICTORY FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

118
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:31,492
YOU CAN'T FORGET WHY HE WAS

119
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:32,593
IMPRISONED IN THE FIRST PLACE,

120
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:33,728
HIS MINISTRY.

121
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,363
A LOT OF CHRISTIAN IS A ROUND

00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:36,264
THE WORLD APPRECIATE THAT HE'S

123
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,166
NOW BEEN RELEASED.

124
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,801
>> Bret: YOU MENTION, KAREN, THE

125
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:42,503
MISSING JOURNALIST, KHASHOGGI.

126
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:43,671
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT THAT

127
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,806
TODAY ON THE TARMAC AS WELL.

128
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,041
>> President Trump: WE'RE GOING

129
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,877
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH

00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:51,779
RESPECT TO THE TERRIBLE

131
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,881
SITUATION IN TURKEY, HAVING TO

132
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:54,682
DO WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND THE

133
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:56,317
REPORTER.

134
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,119
A LOT OF RECORDS ARE OVERLOOKED.

135
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,254
IF LOOK AT IRAN, SO MANY OTHER

136
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:01,522

LOT OF COUNTRIES' RECORDS HAVE

139
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,494
BEEN OVERLOOKED.

140
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:07,962
I WILL BE CALLING AT SOME POINT

141
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:09,597
KING SALMAN.

142
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:11,132
>> Bret: WHERE DOES THIS GO?

143
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,967
THERE'S REPORTING, MULTIPLE NEWS

144
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:14,101
ORGANIZATIONS, SAYING THERE'S

U.S. INTELLIGENCE SHOWING THERE

146
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:16,737
ARE INTERCEPTS OR CALLS OR

147
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,207
RECORDINGS.

148
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,375
TURKISH SAY THEY HAVE HEARD AND

149
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,578
SEEN EVIDENCE OF THIS.

150
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,780
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT BEEN PRIVY

151
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,647
TO THAT AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

152
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:26,981
CORRECT?

153
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,583
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

154
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,051
AND THE OTHER THING, THOUGH,

155
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,319
THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM THE

156
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,322
U.S. INTELLIGENCE, THE

157
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,923
"WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED, THAT

158
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:38,759
THE CROWN PRINCE HAD, IN FACT,

159
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,898
OKAYED AN EARLIER PLAN TO LURE

160
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:44,732
JAMAL KHASHOGGI TO SAUDI ARABIA

161
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:45,399
AND ESSENTIALLY ABDUCT HIM

162
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,002
THERE.

163
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:49,870
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF SIGNS, A

164
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,340
LOT OF ARROWS, POINTING TO THE

165
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,041
VERY TOP, TOP LEVELS OF THE

166
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,844
SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

167
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:00,014
>> Bret: THIS IS HEINOUS, IF IT

168
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,882
HAPPENED, AND IF THEY FIND OUT

169
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:05,820
IT HAPPENED IT'S HORRIFIC.

170
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,623
FROM PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT REGIMES,

171
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:11,158
AND HOW THEY DEAL WITH THINGS

172
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,861
AROUND THE WORLD, IS THERE ANY

173
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:17,265
DAYLIGHT IN DEALING WITH THE

174
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,433
REGIME THAT IT TURNS OUT DID

175
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:19,734
THIS?

176
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:20,935
>> IT'S VERY HARD.

177
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:24,238
THIS IS, I MEAN, BOTH CRIMINAL

178
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,573
AND IT'S A BETRAYAL, PERSONAL

179
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,108
BETRAYAL.

180
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,610
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS EMBRACED THE

181
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:30,778
CROWN PRINCE.

182
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,680
IT WAS HIS FIRST COUNTRY THAT HE

183
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:33,347
VISITED AS PRESIDENT OF THE

184
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:33,781
UNITED STATES.

185
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,883
HE MADE DEALS WITH THEM.

186
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:37,184
HE'S SHIFTED OUR FOREIGN POLICY

187
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:38,853
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AWAY FROM

188
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,755
COURTING IRAN AND BRINGING THEM

189
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,223
AROUND AND TOWARDS SUPPORTING

190
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:43,924
OUR ALLIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA AND

191
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:44,258
ISRAEL.

192
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,594
HE PUT A LOT ON THE LINE.

193
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:48,696
MBS, IF HE'S BEHIND THIS,

194
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:49,430
BETRAYED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE

195
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:50,965
UNITED STATES.

196
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:51,999
>> Bret: MATTHEW.

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,234
>>> IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE

198
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:53,968
EVIDENCE THAT THE CROWN PRINCE

199
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:55,336
IS BEHIND IT.

200
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:56,037
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE EVIDENCE

201
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,872
YET.

202
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,341
EVEN THE PLOT THAT KAREN

203
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:01,442
DESCRIBED IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM

204
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:03,644
WHAT THE TURKS ARE ACCUSING THE

205
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:05,613
SAUDIS OF DOING, TORTURING,

206
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:06,814
MURDERING, AND THEN DISMEMBERING

207
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,049
HIM IN THE CONSULATE IN

208
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,916
ISTANBUL.

209
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,686
NOT IN SAUDI ARABIA.

210
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:15,723
I A LOT OF PEOPLE ON CAPITOL

211
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:16,657
HILL ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND

212
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,726
EVIDENCE.

213
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:21,128
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, THAT THE

214
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,763
SAUDI-U.S. ALLIANCE CARRIES

215
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:24,198
GREAT COSTS AND HAS CARRIED

216
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,500
GREAT COSTS FOR DECADES F THAT

217
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:27,935
ALLIANCE WERE TO BREAK, THERE

218
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:29,603
WOULD BE COSTS AS WELL.

219
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:31,539
SO, AS WE EVALUATE THE

220
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,808
PUNISHMENT, THAT SHOULD BE METED

221
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,676
OF THE IF THE CRIME IS PROVEN,

222
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:36,744
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

223
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,280
WHAT THE MIDDLE EAST DOESN'T

224
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:41,615
NEED IS ANOTHER FAILED STATE.

225
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:42,883
>> Bret: KAREN, LAST WORD?

226
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,785
>> I THINK THAT IT IS INCUMBENT

227
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,320
ON US TO, FROM THE UNITED

228
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,521
STATES, TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO GET

229
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:48,689
A CLEAR ANSWER.

230
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,725
THE SAUDIS ARE SAYING HE LEFT

231
00:06:50,726 --> 00:00:00,000
THE CONSULATE.
