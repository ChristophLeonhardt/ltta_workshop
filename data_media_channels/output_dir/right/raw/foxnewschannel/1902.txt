NOT LIKE TO GET DRAWN INTO THIS.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,529
LAST NIGHT, I REACHED A SENIOR

ROCKET ATTACK FROM SYRIA AGAINST

RIGHT TO ACT IN SELF-DEFENSE.

23
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:50,161
IRAN'S ISLAMIC REVOLUTION GUARD

STEPS."

29
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:01,172
THIS IS THE LARGEST ISRAELI

DOZENS OF SITES WERE IRANIAN

THEY FIRED 20 MISSILES.

52
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,720
SOME OF THEM GOT IN THE IRON

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,587

54
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:50,355
ISRAEL RESPONDED WITH A VERY

00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:51,823
STRONG RETALIATORY RESPONSE

56
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:54,092
AGAINST IRAN AND SYRIA.

57
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:55,860

00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:20,785
SYRIA DOES.

69
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,854
THEY WOULD NOT STAND BY AND

00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:23,621
ALLOW IRRADIATING INFRASTRUCTURE
