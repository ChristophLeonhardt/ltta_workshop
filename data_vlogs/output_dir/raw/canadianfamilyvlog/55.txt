<font color="#E5E5E5">been sort of slowly adding like recipes</font>

and things that I've discovered and yeah

00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:52,789
stages but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love you to go by and</font>

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,679
done is prepared a few questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

23
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,929
Gareth that are some things that I've

24
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,640
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about what I'm trying to</font>

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,140
figure out whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not this is the</font>

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,030
right choice for me and my family and I

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,530
think probably a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of questions that</font>

28
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,020
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other people have to the first</font>

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,630
one would be what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was your decision like</font>

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,130
what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main reason why you thought</font>

31
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,140
maybe I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> switch becoming a vegan</font>

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,329
or maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should switch to vegetarian</font>

33
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,039
or what were the steps that made you

34
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,479
just make this decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well it's</font>

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,759
been like a transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me I was</font>

36
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,429
vegetarian for way longer than then I

37
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:33,469
have been a vegan and the original

38
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason I went vegetarian was because I</font>

39
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,119
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot of yoga at the time and</font>

40
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,630
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become a yoga teacher and</font>

41
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,469
traditionally the yoga teachers have

42
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,009
always been a vegetarian because of a

43
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,170
certain branch of yoga called ahimsa

44
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,999
which is non-violence and so I guess

45
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,479
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also relates to the violence</font>

46
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,369
towards animals and they didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

47
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,749
consume that violence is like a

48
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,569
spiritual edge to it I just did it

49
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">because that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they get I didn't</font>

50
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">really analyze that at the time so I</font>

51
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:09,679
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a vegetarian and it was a</font>

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,959
vegetarian for quite a few years that I

53
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,370
moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> China for a while and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

54
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,019
difficult so I stopped being a

55
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,870
vegetarian was actually when I moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

56
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,819
Canada after I first started thinking

57
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,440
about becoming vegan and it was because

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,549
of certain documentaries that were

59
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,680
appearing on netflix and some of the

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,209
modern science<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

61
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,670
getting aware of and because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

62
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,250
health history well actually happened as

63
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got very sick and I've not really been</font>

64
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,819
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinpoint the reason why I got</font>

65
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,769
sick but I was convinced that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

66
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:45,590
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I ate and I was bedridden</font>

67
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,910
for a few days and my doctor<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it</font>

68
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,069
was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with my intestines</font>

69
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,480
anyway um it made me think of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mum who</font>

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,269
died<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cancer when I was 19 because she</font>

71
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,459
she was very weak and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she couldn't move</font>

72
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,709
around a lot and I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font>

73
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">avoid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at all costs so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of</font>

74
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,959
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do for myself</font>

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,079
in terms of a healthy<font color="#CCCCCC"> diet as as I said</font>

76
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,849
I'd watched night of forks and it really

77
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,790
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spoke true to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so that's</font>

78
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,790
when I first committed to like a whole

79
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,340
food plant-based diet<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually closed</font>

80
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,549
mold<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a strong veganism philosophy</font>

81
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,359
cool um I know you have kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have</font>

82
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,900
kids and changing just my diet is not

83
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">something as simple and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more I read</font>

84
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the more research I find that</font>

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,260
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things that I would</font>

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">want this diet to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be affected in my kids</font>

87
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,530
as well as my life in my wife's life but

88
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,970
so far with some of the recipes I've

89
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,349
been trying I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been having a hard time</font>

90
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,560
getting my kids to like the food so can

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to maybe a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about</font>

92
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,639
your challenges of maybe getting

93
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,569
incorporating this food into your kids

94
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,340
diets and maybe if you have some tips

95
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,540
for everybody uh yeah for sure I can and

96
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,639
it's a great question in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's one that I</font>

97
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,150
get asked a lot um because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

98
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,419
concern that when you become a vegan

99
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,820
you're somehow lacking in nutrition and

100
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,728
perhaps if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that then</font>

101
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:24,200
if you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are somehow</font>

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,610
putting your children at risk by

103
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,870
changing this diet then

104
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,910
it can be of a concern you know someone

105
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,530
could perhaps suggest that you're

106
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,690
abusing your children in some way and if

107
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,479
you if you felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that was true</font>

108
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,300
then maybe feel justified in some of

109
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,590
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ax</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their motions towards that so</font>

110
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,050
when someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> asks me that I get a little</font>

111
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,150
it's some some part inside me gets a

112
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,410
little bit defensive because I feel like

113
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">they might think that I'm somehow</font>

114
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,389
damaging my children in some way but

115
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,270
what I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to learn is especially</font>

116
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,130
since I've only been vegan a long time

117
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,320
is it's socially impossible to get your

118
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">children to to go vegan like feeling cuz</font>

119
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,740
I've bought my children up on a Western

120
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,990
diet and so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already familiar</font>

121
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,910
with the foods that they like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and foods</font>

122
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,130
that they don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and children don't</font>

123
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,960
really like vegetables as it is right

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,970
they don't yeah the certain foods that

125
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,410
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> riken if you suddenly giving</font>

126
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,940
them plates of vegetables and you're

127
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,770
gonna have like a fight from from the

128
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,580
start so why would recommend is what

129
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,130
I've done is my son really likes nuggets

130
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,050
so I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply replaced the Nuggets</font>

131
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have with with</font>

132
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,430
vegetarian nuggets and he can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

133
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,110
difference to him they're exactly the

134
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,630
same and sometimes I'll eat one of these

135
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,400
vegetarian nuggets and I'll be worried

136
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've actually accidentally eaten a</font>

137
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:43,340
chicken nugget because some of them are

138
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,860
so familiar now oh really really it's

139
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,289
gonna like which brand of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nagurski like</font>

140
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,060
what is more awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't remember</font>

141
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now but I'll message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to you</font>

142
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool we had to double check the</font>

143
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,849
back cuz kaylene almost spat it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out my</font>

144
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,849
wife my wife has become vegan so it's

145
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,490
the I can't express how helpful that has

146
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,050
been at me and killing her both vegan

147
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,539
were both going on this journey together

148
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,280
if I would recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to anyone</font>

149
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,810
because it's hard to do when you're not

150
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,710
be honest but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of my children I</font>

151
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,849
explained to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them what I'm doing and why</font>

152
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:19,910
I'm doing it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll experiment</font>

153
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,139
with certain meals and I'll keep

154
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,060

thing that comes into my house from time

158

to time is cheese<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the kids love</font>

159
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,490

168
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,990
like the vanilla milk in my tea I have I

169
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,050
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really miss cow's milk and I've</font>

170
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,000
never really had a craving for cows milk

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
after and once I looked at where it came

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,500
from and how it comes and things that go

173
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,020
through the process it just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

174
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,610
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know almond milk or soy milk</font>

175
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">yet needs to be needs to be the choice</font>

176
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,720
and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are 40 fortified and</font>

177
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,910
by that you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the path package</font>

178
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,100
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see how much you need for</font>

179
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,440
you know there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it maybe 12 in</font>

180
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,870
it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vitamins in there</font>

181
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,590
as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a lot of my daily</font>

182
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,960
intake of it in b12 just from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> soy</font>

183
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">milk i have also good levels of protein</font>

184
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,270
soy milk as well cheese is more

185
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,950
difficult and there are chococheese

186
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,870
alternative so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got like da cheese</font>

187
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,280
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a very particular flavor</font>

188
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,860
and it's not yeah it's nice not we take

189
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,050
this is exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like cheese it's got the</font>

190
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,640
same consistency and it melts<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

191
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,830
not got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same flavor ok new cheese</font>

192
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,900
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chow cheese is almost exactly the</font>

193
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,520
same as cheese but it only comes in

194
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,530
slices right now once they come out with

195
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,710
like a shredded trees then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

196
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,100
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd have a problem yeah at</font>

197
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day as a parent I want my</font>

198
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,610
children to eat if I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my</font>

199
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">children to eat the food that I'm making</font>

200
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,900
and it's very rare that they do eat the

201
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:20,620
food that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong now I make I have to</font>

202
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,390
compromise so what I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing is</font>

203
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,970
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been putting lots of different</font>

204
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,100
choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them sorry my phone keeps</font>

205
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,580
going off pull it together man I'll just

206
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,620
throw it a threat over<font color="#CCCCCC"> there um it's a</font>

207
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,929
tough one what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

208
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:42,580
conclusion is when you're a kid because

209
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,130
you're so active the impact isn't as bad

210
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,450
as when you're my age so<font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's</font>

211
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,470
some studies that show that

212
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,320
the the beginnings of heart disease can

213
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,970
show up in children<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Western diet</font>

214
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,420
from as early as 10 so obviously as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

215
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,810
get older the more riskier and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mum</font>

216
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,950
she died she died in her mid-40s so of

217
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,690
cancer and I believe from my research

218
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,140
that that's you can be prevented by my

219
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,120
whole food plant-based diet with

220
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,830
exercise<font color="#CCCCCC"> II so for me I'm not so</font>

221
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,330
concerned to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> children right now I've</font>

222
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,260
proven to myself from what I eat I can

223
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,570
be healthy and I give my children a

224
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,040
variety what I do is I get head like a

225
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,260
fruit tray and I get a vegetable tray

226
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,050
and usually they nibble on like lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

227
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,970
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then out of like</font>

228
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,850
fake chicken nuggets you know

229
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,810
occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll go to like their</font>

230
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,280
grandparents and they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out for like</font>

231
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,860
McDonald's and stuff like for me I don't

232
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,570
want them to have a childhood where

233
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,040
they're forced into being alienated

234
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,510
because they have this special diet

235
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,880
especially if they don't need it because

236
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,220
it makes it causes them in the media

237
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,440
threat I think it's a parent it's my job

238
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,910
to let them<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where it comes from and</font>

239
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,320
hopefully they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

240
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">their own decisions as well as the l a--</font>

241
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,970
has defined herself as vegetarian I

242
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,650
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that she's just</font>

243
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,510
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she's vegetarian she</font>

244
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,100
doesn't like me but she likes cheese and

245
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,810
she seems to understand what she's doing

246
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,460
that's that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

247
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,230
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shaming my</font>

248
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,270
children or guilt England yeah they're

249
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">not doing what I think they should do</font>

250
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,110
you know so basically you kind of tried

251
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporate more healthy options well</font>

252
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,920
that's the same time just making sure

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,690
they're eating things this normal

254
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,880
whether that be a vegan or whole food

255
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,300
diet or not yeah yeah um a variety of

256
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">different foods and I remember they</font>

257
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,740
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to eat as much as us I'd like</font>

258
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sneak in like beans and you know as I</font>

259
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,420
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of vegetables protein is</font>

260
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,030
important but it I don't think from from

261
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,410
what I've been reading it's quite as

262
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,960
important as we are culturally believed

263
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,830
to be um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said its cultural culturally</font>

264
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,420
believe the Bieber it's still something

265
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,280
I take no of um for my own well-being I

266
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,530
occasionally type in ye into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a day into</font>

267
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,660
an app called

268
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,660
chronometer and it will tell you exactly

269
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,890
what the nutrition is what I've

270
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,230
discovered is I can get everything I

271
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,360
need to every day if I really want to I

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,740
know and I don't think by any means

273
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,300
we're supposed to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum nutrition</font>

274
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,580
every day because I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

275
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,170
we kept we had that opportunity if we

276
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,839
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think our bodies</font>

277
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,440
have been sort of geared to believe that

278
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what we deserve every day I think</font>

279
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know if we can then maybe we should</font>

280
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,140
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a rounded off you know</font>

281
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,120
I work yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's rounded off to</font>

282
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,980
like a monthly basis in terms of body

283
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,260
growth right yeah anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when I</font>

284
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,880
first went vegan I was kind of really

285
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,860
anxious about not get not getting the

286
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,290
right amount of protein or whatever and

287
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,890
I thought well I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test this and</font>

288
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way I could test it was by</font>

289
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,250
putting everything into this chronometer

290
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,360
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I quickly learned that you know</font>

291
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,730
I could reach why I needed to yeah to

292
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,150
reach and all i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is eat eat</font>

293
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,339
the calories I would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

294
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,710
doing exercise as well because you read

295
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,480
the calories it puts you over a certain

296
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,370
to our shoulders to harmony is it makes

297
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,750
me look at what i need is calories as

298
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,480
well but it also made me look like where

299
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">i need to be active part of the problem</font>

300
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,350
with today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're eating the wrong</font>

301
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,330
foods and we're also<font color="#CCCCCC"> sat sun our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couches</font>

302
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,630
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> day yes we're not even fighting what</font>

303
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,820
it is we're consuming we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font>

304
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,980
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's a lose-lose</font>

305
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,830
situation at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good people who were</font>

306
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,780
active who were reading like your

307
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,030
standard Western diet are fighting it

308
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,710
like your body has a chance and studies

309
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,510
show that the people who do do regular

310
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,150
exercise you know that are healthier and

311
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,280
half a body that's a better condition

312
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,450
what I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do now is I've</font>

313
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,839
started doing more exercise and it just

314
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,750
because I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading and I've been</font>

315
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,730
noticing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my weight has has</font>

316
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,010
plateaued right some people assume that

317
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,360
when if you're if you're vegan while

318
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,790
your mail just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like evaporate but you</font>

319
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,320
can still eat certain foods which are

320
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,900
high in calories and low and nutrition a

321
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,550
vegan diet really by definition is is

322
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,460
just

323
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,440
avoids the suffering of animals it's not

324
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about diet it's about trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

325
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,360
avoid the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sufferer to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in the</font>

326
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,740
suffering suffering of animals all

327
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,420
together and that is in part with the

328
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,190
diet but there's also like your clothing

329
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,320
does you know the decisions that you

330
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,080
make in terms of buying certain products

331
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,840
that may or may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you know tests on</font>

332
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,400
animals and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

333
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,630
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and honestly I didn't think</font>

334
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,070
that much about it when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like yeah</font>

335
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,140
I'm going begin and I'm like oh I've got

336
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,240
belts and this and I suppose I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

337
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,520
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now right so if you</font>

338
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a plant-based whole food</font>

339
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,170
I and you can you can reap all the

340
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,520
benefits but once you become a

341
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,160
plant-based person you start thinking

342
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,070
about why these people are eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> hummus</font>

343
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,550
yeah what's what what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about</font>

344
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,830
and then you start to in at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in my</font>

345
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,480
experience have a bit more compassion

346
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,520
for the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Earthlings the other</font>

347
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,500
animals of the planet for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure is that</font>

348
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,240
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that answer your question just</font>

349
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,080
let's just care for your children and

350
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,840
assure all they eat I don't like scold

351
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,600
them if they if they don't eat right

352
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,310
like yeah guys like one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst</font>

353
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,410
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in this the same with anything</font>

354
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,240
with kids if you pressure them enough to

355
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,440
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're gonna go the</font>

356
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,660
opposite of it usually yeah but become

357
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,400
though like run off and become hunters

358
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,930
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe oh god no no that's good</font>

359
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,450
look why do things yeah you're really i

360
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,190
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share i want to be healthy</font>

361
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">i want to be useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know and I'm</font>

362
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">influence my children not only for sure</font>

363
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,010
one thing I heard you mentioning was

364
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,630
about the different milks and how you

365
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,190
can kind of you can make those if you

366
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,200
wanted well that leads me to my next

367
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,750
question which is do you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

368
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,970
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> spending a significant more</font>

369
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,670
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time with making your meals</font>

370
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,400
when it's vegan or vegetarian or is it

371
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,480
similar to what you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing before</font>

372
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,700
well that's a good question and again I

373
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,160
something I was worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it can</font>

374
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,830
it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> being smart and it's about</font>

375
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">planning in advance so i have a slow</font>

376
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,150
cooker<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a large slow cooker and</font>

377
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,120
I one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite meals is chilly so</font>

378
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,350
vegetable chili so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I double up I</font>

379
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">like right to the top and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

380
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,520
you know my<font color="#E5E5E5"> family then I freeze the</font>

381
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,040
rest and then I do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

382
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next night or maybe a night layer</font>

383
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
right it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a soup or it could be</font>

384
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,780
a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of chilly let's say I</font>

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,700
a raw meal just eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> mangoes I just</font>

465
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">called raw there's a raw vegan thorough</font>

466
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,520
raw vegans out there that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat raw</font>

467
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,200
me also feel so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning they</font>

468
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,910
could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smoothie and then in there</font>

469
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,190
in the evening in there the afternoon

470
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,020
know they'll have like maybe a salad or

471
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,500
a bunch of bananas and in the evening

472
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,920
they again have some kind of I've got a

473
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,030
book<font color="#E5E5E5"> here actually I've been</font>

474
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">experimenting with it a bit more I've</font>

475
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,220
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> been learning about it but a lot of</font>

476
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,460
people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this diet called raw till 4</font>

477
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,410
book at the library the other day well

478
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,450
that leads me on to another thing right

479
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,610
if you don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of money like me</font>

480
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,100
at my poor student I was like I need to

481
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">learn stuff about the vegan diet to</font>

482
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,290
learn recipes or for some reason my mind

483
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,930
was automatically like any books so I

484
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,210
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the library and they did have a</font>

485
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,820
large collection of books which I

486
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,410
borrowed and then I took pictures of the

487
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,570
meals which I still use their in or on

488
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,410
my phone now um but then a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

489
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,450
meals have come from groups that I've

490
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,280
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of friends on Facebook who</font>

491
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,590
are vegans and they share these amazing

492
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,360
meals one of my favorite is

493
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">king wah one pot quinoa chili one pot it</font>

494
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,309
takes 20 minutes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make and then it's a</font>

495
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,010
delicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> meal yeah so what are a couple</font>

496
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,480
of those facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups do you mind</font>

497
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention them or are they private oh no</font>

498
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,980
no no not private they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

499
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,730
groups well let me say this right you

500
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,640
may be part of a group on a vegan page

501
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,790
and I let me tell you this there's a lot

502
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,260
of vegans who who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry because they</font>

503
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,210
find the situation with what we do to

504
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,590
animals to be intolerable and they

505
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,630
thought about it for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so as a</font>

506
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,040
new vegan or someone who is a

507
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,850
plant-based person I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and just</font>

508
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,890
ignore these people who were angry and

509
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,809
focus on the ones who want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you</font>

510
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,600
like me I will I will never be angry at

511
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,179
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to investigate</font>

512
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,130
becoming a vegan our<font color="#CCCCCC"> villa overjoyed but</font>

513
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,110
some people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very loud that</font>

514
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">they user turn militant and you may be</font>

515
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,980
friends with one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

516
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,809
feel kind of alone there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

517
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,240
vegans and maybe your family<font color="#CCCCCC"> judge you</font>

518
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you've made these decisions</font>

519
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:57,650
you'll reach out to people on facebook

520
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,510
and you become friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them and</font>

521
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,520
some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are beautiful people who i</font>

522
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,110
love and knows the people who share

523
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,210
these meals and I saved them in the on

524
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,250
facebook you can click<font color="#CCCCCC"> save link I've</font>

525
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,919
got maybe fifty of them now and I've

526
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,280
cooked maybe eight of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found eight</font>

527
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've favorite out there like a</font>

528
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,100
vegan mac and cheese that I made that

529
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,870
Ella likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all old man who doesn't like</font>

530
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">it he likes regular mac and cheese so</font>

531
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,140
again that's a compromise so that's what

532
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,960
I do it's my it's my new vegan friends

533
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,910
that share stuff but if anyone watching

534
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,250
us now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll share those links that I've</font>

535
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,200
got with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can benefit from</font>

536
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,090
those because some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are really</font>

537
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,809
awesome but again every so often i would

538
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,190
put what you eat in a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

539
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,630
chronometer just to make sure that you

540
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,960
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting all of your nutrients and</font>

541
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,630
your vitamins and<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize you'll notice</font>

542
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,000
that when you do the god that when i

543
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,320
first went vegan there was a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

544
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,690
change like<font color="#CCCCCC"> my body was cleansing itself</font>

545
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,550
that are from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the meats that were in</font>

546
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">my body and so um basically your stools</font>

547
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,650
become more regular you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

548
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,410
constipation as much and that's that's a

549
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,870
great thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> too but it takes you by</font>

550
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,330
surprise when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you first change and so</font>

551
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">just be prepared for that over the first</font>

552
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,470
few days but in terms of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font>

553
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,560
question it really depends on you you

554
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,850
know if you want to have a plant-based

555
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,150
diet than sure you can you can spend a

556
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,400
lot of time yet when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you first change</font>

557
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,900
you will spend a bit of time learning

558
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,550
new foods there's no two ways about that

559
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,520
but what I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend you do is at</font>

560
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,380
your local supermarket find where the

561
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,730
veggie oil is there's usually a veggie

562
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,280
section and this usually a few different

563
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">process dudes that you would like so</font>

564
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,610
data they start doing pizzas wow these

565
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,950
are really good the did start doing more

566
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,560
of them as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said there's nuggets this</font>

567
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,520
burgers so these processed foods<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

568
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,390
using to sort of fill in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meals so I</font>

569
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,370
had time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn the new meals yeah</font>

570
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,290
like maybe say in a week i would i would

571
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,230
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and learn three new meals you know</font>

572
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,000
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would have like sandwiches</font>

573
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,270
and smaller meals it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

574
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,220
ahead but if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become a</font>

575
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,760
vegan plant-based person first of all

576
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,170
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make that decision and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

577
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,200
have to you have to plan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not not</font>

578
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,870
waver on that and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> one way in order to</font>

579
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,400
do that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just saying i'm only</font>

580
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,170
gonna do it for a year right after the

581
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">year i'm pretty sure that you'll be like</font>

582
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,860
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go back but saying that</font>

583
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,750
and even saying two different people

584
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,090
saying i'm just experimenting i'm just

585
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">experimenting for a year it gets rid of</font>

586
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,320
them being too in-your-face about it

587
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,060
because you're like thinks people can

588
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,620
understand if you're just experimenting

589
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,270
with something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you just say</font>

590
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,600
totally gone then sometimes yeah you'll

591
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,140
get like people like judging you and

592
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,550
pressuring you in some ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

593
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,280
saying it was the case just some

594
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,410
sometimes it happens and to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

595
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,630
just just okay i noticed i think you're

596
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,700
a negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> inverter something yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

597
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,410
think it's because it makes them think

598
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">about their diet and when you live in a</font>

599
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,450
society which is very pro so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our Western</font>

600
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,790
Western diet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's saturated it's</font>

601
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,100
everywhere you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and veganism is</font>

602
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,870
virtually nowhere

603
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,059
yeah it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a very radical it</font>

604
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,160
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a very radical thing but if</font>

605
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they feel that the slaughtering</font>

606
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,770
of animals for how they feel for no

607
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,830
reason whatsoever is extremely radical

608
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,100
you know and also the milk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where</font>

609
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,600
that comes from is is what they were

610
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,130
considered to be quite radical as well

611
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,320
and to actually just step away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

612
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to be part of that</font>

613
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,880
at least in that in their view is

614
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,880
there's a fairly sane choice so that

615
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,620
leads me to my next question in a way

616
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,710
that you're easy to say let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

617
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,870
all these different foods and less skin

618
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,210
healthier vegetables and maybe some

619
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,050
specialty made vegetable based processed

620
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,500
foods but would you say that your bills

621
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,570
or your for the grocery shopping has

622
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,190
increased<font color="#CCCCCC"> adolphe be based on these</font>

623
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,230
diets or has a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of plateaued and</font>

624
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,720
state even or just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more how</font>

625
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,200
is it affected your life<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've noticed it</font>

626
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,850
depends on what you buy and where you

627
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,770
shop so we have a shop appear called

628
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">old-fashioned foods which i believe is</font>

629
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,670
similar to a shop when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was i was</font>

630
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,740
reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> a post today someone posted</font>

631
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a shutdown in the states which</font>

632
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,160
is called like Whole Foods or something

633
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,010
yeah yeah yeah and and joke was you can

634
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,530
the food is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so ridiculous pense</font>

635
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,390
ridiculously<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive you can spend</font>

636
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,890
like 60 bucks and come out with like

637
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,780
three onions or something that's what

638
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,040
it's like here we have one is called

639
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,710
nature's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Emporium yes when you go there</font>

640
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well look at all these great</font>

641
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,010
things but then by time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

642
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,630
everything up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're spending like six</font>

643
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,400
seven hundred dollars for a regular like

644
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,470
two hundred dollar grocery bag of kale

645
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,230
chips is like 15 bucks yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly and</font>

646
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,210
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be delicious but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

647
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">make them myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I bet you getting your</font>

648
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,840
own cow and shoving them in the oven for

649
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,900
like five minutes or whatever my advice

650
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,440
would be just buy produce if you can and

651
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,910
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the occasional processed foods like</font>

652
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,610
okay like you you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like oh my</font>

653
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,530
god I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just eating grass</font>

654
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,380
well you can buy some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cookies which and</font>

655
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,110
a half won every so often which would

656
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,260
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ease the transition a little bit</font>

657
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,970
right so everyone likes a tree

658
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,400
occasionally and a vegan is no different

659
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,170
and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that may or may</font>

660
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,760
not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit pricier compared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

661
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know just your regular fruits and</font>

662
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,750
veg but to answer your question like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

663
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,000
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a pause I'm a student right</font>

664
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,610

665
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,030
supporting three children and we've not

666
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,220
noticed a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal of difference in</font>

667
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,480
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> prices if you think about it</font>

668
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,050
cheese it's very expensive meats very

669
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,270
expensive you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> even find that you</font>

670
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,310
save a bit of money if you if you plan

671
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,030
like I have if you get a like a crock

672
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,480

673
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,610

676
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,790
bit of time to chop<font color="#E5E5E5"> up all the veggies</font>

679
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,950
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooking for yourself you could have</font>

680
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,130

<font color="#E5E5E5">delicious treats and stuff like that</font>

689
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,400
it's all based on cookies and breads and

690
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,190
everything like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most of</font>

691
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,420
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> or things i like to snack</font>

692
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,040
on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm excited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through this</font>

693
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,770
book and post some<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos about some of</font>

694
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,750
these recipes too so that's another

695
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,180
option instead of having to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

696
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,460
yeah but the vegetables generally had

697
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,560
quite cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> without a bit of an issue in</font>

698
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,260
canada recently because of the economy

699
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,640
honey it was being like 15 bucks for

700
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,890
like a bushel of asparagus well guess

was growing asparagus in my garden

706
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,290
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spent so that's one</font>

707
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,450
thing I'm doing to compromise the price

708
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,490
is I'm finding out what are the most

709
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,190

two times I run and I had so much more

766
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,250
stamina like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could I could go for</font>

767
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,160
much longer and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about why</font>

768
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,920
that would be and when you stop eating

769
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,110
animal products you stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting that</font>

770
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,600
cholesterol in your veins which makes

771
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,270
your veins smaller right and I figured

772
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,620
if you stop eating it then your veins

773
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,610
will probably open up a bit more allow

774
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:14,110
blood to travel oxygen more freely so I

775
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,430
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well maybe I'm just getting</font>

776
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,410
more oxygen to my heart and to my brain

777
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,120
and that's what's giving me a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

778
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,370
extra stamina that's interesting yeah

779
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,990
and I found that with other exercises

780
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,900
too I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get that really chest</font>

781
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,350
tight like winded feeling that I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

782
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,690
when I would exercise and part of that

783
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,520
would would actually make me not want to

784
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,780
exercise because it was a painful

785
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,390
experience but since going vegan when I

786
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,700
do do exercise it's never like that

787
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,100
really it's never that uncomfortable I

788
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,040
like usually yeah but and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

789
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,410
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something to do with with how</font>

790
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,970
my blood work is now yeah but I like to

791
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,430
stay up<font color="#CCCCCC"> late and my kids get me up super</font>

792
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,650
early so what my problem is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

793
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:02,410
tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah and maybe my um maybe my</font>

794
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,150
veganism is just harming me to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

795
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,390
that bit better yeah it's difficult to

796
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,940
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the pits my energy I've</font>

797
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,630
noticed um well what this is someone was

798
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,730
saying the first sign that you have of

799
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">like heart disease</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that</font>

800
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:31,810
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in you get affected in</font>

801
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,320
certain areas and when you when you

802
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,000
change to a vegan diet you notice some

803
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,130
changes in that area or a bit more and I

804
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:45,060
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if I basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like if</font>

805
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are having problems connecting to</font>

806
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,420
your partner in some ways being vegan

807
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,240
opens opens you up a bit more as I was

808
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,800
saying because your veins are open a bit

809
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,770
more how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain this is it's kind of</font>

810
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,780
like an adult concept and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

811
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,400
to go into it into too much detail but

812
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,229
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are having problem</font>

813
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:08,899
sir dysfunction if you have heart

814
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,700
disease that that's the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

815
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,820
shows and if you go vegan often this

816
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,070
situation is reversed and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that a</font>

817
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit in relation to me as well</font>

818
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,299
that's those kind of things have

819
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,609
improved also and if you want to know

820
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:25,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">more about that the knives / forks over</font>

821
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:27,979
knives talks more in detail about<font color="#CCCCCC"> deadly</font>

822
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:30,859
right hmm so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering more</font>

823
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,210
about what Garrett's talking about there

824
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,409
you could feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to go check that out</font>

825
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:36,830
too it's a documentary on netflix i

826
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,489
would recommend three find topics

827
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:42,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">specials for for the death like for me</font>

828
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:46,669
there's like three like prongs of the

829
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:48,710
vegan fork and the first one is like

830
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,009
human health which is very well touched

831
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:54,440
upon by forks over knives that the

832
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,080
second one is Farmageddon which goes

833
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,450
into like the environmental impacts of

834
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,339
the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> Western diet in terms of</font>

835
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:07,820
like how the cows are kept and what or

836
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,020
what like heavily produced mass farming

837
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,029
is doing to the environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

838
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:16,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">third one is called Earthlings and it</font>

839
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,859
goes very much into how the animals are

840
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">trapped and you know the moral</font>

841
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:23,000
implications of carrying on doing

842
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to the animals without really</font>

843
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:27,109
considering their own well-being I would

844
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,909
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching all three of those</font>

845
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,859
and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can consider where</font>

846
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:33,319
you sit which is most important to you

847
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:36,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">because ice tired on sort forks over</font>

848
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:39,619
knives and then I kind of it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

849
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the other two are just import as</font>

850
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:43,779
important to me now as the original one

851
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:47,299
cool but i'll even go as far to say as

852
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:49,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">we live in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a selfish society so</font>

853
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,500
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> go come to figure nism</font>

854
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,668
because they're looking for the health

855
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:55,609
benefits for themselves first and you

856
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:57,529
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did that for myself I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

857
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,299
that's sure that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the reason I</font>

858
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:02,150
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start into is is purely selfish</font>

859
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,099
reasons i'm not thinking we want to

860
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">start this because i care about the</font>

861
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,329
animals which in turn what i found even

862
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:09,859
myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm starting to think more like</font>

863
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,710
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow like Gareth and I are friends on</font>

864
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,299
Facebook and things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as well</font>

865
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,369
and some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he shared</font>

866
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:18,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've washed and thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself wow</font>

867
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:18,530
this is

868
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,230
crazy never realized these things are

869
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,870
going to place to give me hamburger or

870
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,840
this type of me or fast food options so

871
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,820
once you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

872
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the bigger picture but for</font>

873
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,660
sure I started off for selfish reasons

874
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,390
yeah and the log vegans I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font>

875
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,740
say a lot of vegan still say I'm vegan

876
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,480
for the animals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I always have them</font>

877
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,940
don't allow yourself to be shamed for

878
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,250
people who say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll let you what</font>

879
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,110
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just as good as what</font>

880
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,220
they're doing and and don't like I've

881
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,950
wasted my time trying to justify who I

882
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,110
am and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do there's vegans who say</font>

883
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,360
if you've got children the new you're

884
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,570
not really a vegan right they call you

885
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,370
and if you've got children you should

886
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,840
just sort of step away from that

887
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,120
argument because that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

888
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,730
interested in veganism per se they're

889
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,320
interested in salt spreading their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

890
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,740
agenda now just I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cautious</font>

891
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,060
of that and just remain on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own path</font>

892
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,650
yeah that's gained account reversal I

893
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,030
was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trying to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a point though</font>

894
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,160
but I kind of lost it halfway<font color="#E5E5E5"> through my</font>

895
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,650
spirit that's the worst when it happens

896
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,160
so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> garrotted if you could give us a</font>

897
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,320
couple of tips to maybe help us on our

898
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,150
journeys what would you say would be

899
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most valued tips that you</font>

900
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,120
have well what's kept me on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my journey</font>

901
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:43,550
is found find some support like a friend

902
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,380
it could be a facebook friend who you

903
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,300
can talk to maybe a small community stay

904
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,050
with positive people keep away from

905
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,570
negative people because it's a it's an

906
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,240
emotional journey um and you will you

907
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">will experience negativity and the more</font>

908
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,720
positive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the easier is to</font>

909
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,880
deal with the negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

910
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be honest with you when you first</font>

911
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,820
go into it after a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

912
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,040
you'll feel like you'll be feeling a big

913
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,920
shock because of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are and</font>

914
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,690
that's when you need to lean on these

915
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,300
friends the most is when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

916
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">through this kind of schlock are you</font>

917
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,230
getting and cleansed out of the system

918
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,090
but you're also if you're almost

919
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,010
becoming enlightened to some of the

920
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,960
things which are going on which big

921
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,430
corporations would prefer you

922
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,550
think about don't worry if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you make a</font>

923
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,790
mistake there's so much animal product

924
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,740
in everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to take a while</font>

925
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,200
to learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read like the back of</font>

926
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other recipe you have to you have to</font>

927
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,569
know where it's hidden and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font>

928
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,490
time and occasionally you might eat some

929
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,319
cheese and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone might see you</font>

930
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:52,880
eat some cheese and be like you're

931
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,920
eating cheese forgive<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself and keep</font>

932
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,730
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your path right you know even if at</font>

933
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,290
first you do accidentally deliberately

934
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,420
so you mean to me because you craving it

935
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,809
so much it just try to keep on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that path</font>

936
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:10,520
you know there's no point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in holding in</font>

937
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,839
the Guild's that's not going to get you

938
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,260
in anywhere but if you have accidentally

939
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,819
there's no shame in that if you if you

940
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,770
begin to eat me again and you're aware

941
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,270
of that and that makes it more difficult

942
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,220
to stay on the path<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what's been</font>

943
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,069
integral to me is sticking with the

944
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,710
decision having my wife as<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a support</font>

945
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">having some friends online of support</font>

946
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,290
and planning a bit being like looking at

947
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,819
these recipes and being like I really

948
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,799
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna try that this week</font>

949
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:38,690
and try to do stuff which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

950
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,010
bit familiar to what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

951
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,640
eating to start with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll ease it</font>

952
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,980
a little bit you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll use your</font>

953
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,549
transition a bit more pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

954
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:51,559
that's that's I can't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anything</font>

955
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,530
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's great great tips maybe</font>

957
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,750

961
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:13,040
amazing and he does like he does a video

962
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,380
every year talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how nutrition</font>

963
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,780
can combat certain illnesses like any

964
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,859

American problems that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

966
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,220
now and he would like go through

967
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,799
everyone and say what nutrition can do

968
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:33,109
to reverse this or fight this and it was

969
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,150
very inspirational he's recently come

970
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,680
out with a book that i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy it's</font>

971
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,099
called how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live eatin or something</font>

972
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,579
like that great title yeah another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

973
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font>

974
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,870
joel Fuhrman eat to live he said that

975
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,700
one in the library as well as lucky to

976
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,710
live it's inspiring but he's also been

977
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,990
generous enough to give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cookbook of</font>

978
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,500
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he likes to eat so this</font>

979
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is another one of my favorites because</font>

980
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,950
all of the meals are really good but

981
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,870
they're also really nutritional and he

982
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,400
has like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information at the bottom</font>

983
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,240
by perturbing protein carbohydrates<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat</font>

984
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,010
so you know eases some of that anxiety

985
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,830
maybe download the app chronometer I

986
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,410
think it's like three bucks and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

987
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,090
you can watch what you eat and can

988
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,890
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> your health that way if you like</font>

989
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,710
me and you're like nearing methylation

990
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,220
you wanting to prevent some diseases

991
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,610
like me you might have I like my mom

992
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,190
died of cancer my dad's got diabetes and

993
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,340
my granddad died of stroke and my dad my

994
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,440
other granddad had lung cancer you might

995
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,730
start worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of these</font>

996
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,230
issues because you're like God doesn't

997
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,480
feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just be cursed that's</font>

998
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,790
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could go vegan some of those</font>

999
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,970
anxieties just kind of disappear because

1000
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,660
the statistics show the vegans right

1001
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,640
leaning on a Whole Foods plant-based

1002
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,960
diet live the longest so think you're

1003
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,390
being a little active in a sense yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1004
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't feel like I'm likely to die the</font>

1005
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,610
same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mum did not saying I</font>

1006
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,500
definitely one you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancer isn't</font>

1007
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,260
purely diet based there are different

1008
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,360
definitely different things that you can

1009
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,400
get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know um but it's a large</font>

1010
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,050
contributor and if you can you can use

1011
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,880
diet to prevent it and I feel that you

00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,400
should yeah um<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for support and</font>
