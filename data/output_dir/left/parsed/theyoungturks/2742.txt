LATE LAST WEEK, NEWS BROKE THAT
DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS
ALLEGEDLY PAID OFF A FORMER
ADULT FILM STAR $130,000
SO THAT SHE WOULD NOT GO PUBLIC
WITH AN AFFAIR THAT SHE'D
ENGAGED IN WITH DONALD TRUMP AND
BY GOING PUBLIC, WE MEAN
GOING PUBLIC IN THE WEEKS
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.
THEY APPARENTLY PAID THAT HUGE
AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SHE DID
NOT COME OUT WITH THE STORY.
THAT WAS THE FIRST THAT MOST
PEOPLE HEARD OF THIS ENTIRE
THING, BUT NOT EVERYBODY
ACTUALLY.
SOME PEOPLE HAD HEARD ABOUT IT
EARLIER.
SOME PEOPLE IN FACT HAD HEARD
ABOUT IT BEFORE THE ACTUAL
ELECTION.
WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IS FOX
NEWS.
THE SETTLEMENT THAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT HERE.
ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES THAT
KNOW, SHE HAD THE STORY AND
FOX KILLED IT.
THAT INFORMATION COULD HAVE COME
OUT.
IT WAS REVEALED BEFORE THE
ACTUAL ELECTION, BUT FOX
NEWS SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE OTHER STUFF THAT WE WANT
TO COVER IN THE RUN UP TO
THEIS ELECTION AND SO THEY
ACTUALLY KILLED IT.
UNDERSTAND, FULL DISCLOSURE,
STORMY DANIELS SAYS THAT
THIS ENTIRE THING IS NOT TRUE.
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT BEING
PAID OFF ARE NOT TRUE, THAT
THE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP IS NOT
TRUE AND NEVER ACTUALLY
HAPPENED, BUT SHE IS UNDERCUT BY
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SOURCES.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, HERSELF.
THAT WAS ORIGINALLY WHAT SHE
SAID BACK TO THE MAGAZINE IN
2011 WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY
MULTIPLE OTHER PEOPLE
INCLUDING HER FRIEND AND
EX-HUSBAND AND AT THE TIME
SHE TOOK AND PASSED A POLYGRAPH
ABOUT THAT INFORMATION.
ALSO ALANA EVANS SAID THAT AT
THE TIME THAT SHE WAS HAVING
THIS ENCOUNTER, SHE HAD
RECEIVED A PHONE CALL SAYING,
COME AND HANG OUT WITH US, LET'S
PARTY.
SHE SAYS NOW THAT IT DIDN'T
HAPPEN, AFTER THE ALLEGED
PAYMENT WHICH SHE ALSO SAYS
DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT BACK IN
2011, SHE SAID THAT IT DID.
HERE IS MY PARTIAL DEFENSE OF
DONALD TRUMP AND UP UNTIL
THE VERY LAST ARTICLE I READ,
AND I NEEDLESSLY READ A LOT
ABOUT THIS, I WAS GOING TO DO A
FULL DEFENSE OF HIM, BUT AT
THE END, THEY DID COME UP WITH
REAL REASONS WHY THIS STORY
IS A LITTLE BIT RELEVANT, BUT MY
DEFENSE OF TRUMP IS ONE, I
DO NOT CARE THAT HE HAD AN
AFFAIR.
SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE, THAT SHOWS
THAT HE HAD AN AFFAIR.
AND?
BESIDES WHICH, YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD
AFFAIRS, YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT?
HE SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A NICE
GUY.
WHAT'S Ã±
OF COURSE HE HAS HAD AFFAIRS.
THE SECOND THING HE
SAYS THAT IT PROVES,
THERE ARE ALL THESE ALLEGATIONS
FROM WOMEN ABOUT SEXUAL
ASSAULT, HARASSMENT, ETC.
THIS PROVES THAT HE IS WILLING
TO LIE ABOUT SEX.
OF COURSE.
HE SEEMS LIKE A STRAIGHTFORWARD
AND TRUSTWORTHY GUY.
FIRST OF ALL, I'VE GOT NEWS
FOR YOU.
A LOT OF GUYS ARE WILLING TO LIE
ABOUT SEX, INCLUDING BILL
CLINTON.
SECOND OF ALL, TRUMP LIES
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
HE LIES ABOUT THE WEATHER.
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING HE WON'T
LIE ABOUT.
IF THAT IS A
REVELATION
TO YOU, YOU ARE BEING WILDLY
DISINGENUOUS OR YOU ARE NOT
THAT BRIGHT.
AND THEN SHE GOES IN THE 2011
INTERVIEW WITH INTOUCH
INTERVIEW AND SHE DESCRIBES HOW
THE SEX WITH TRUMP WAS.
DON'T DO THAT, I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW SEX
WITH TRUMP OR OBAMA OR
CHUCK SCHUMER IS.
TO BE FAIR, SHE ONLY SLEPT
WITH TRUMP AS FAR AS WE KNOW.
CHUCK SCHUMER IS IN THE
CLEAR.
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE IT CONTEXT,
THAT'S FAIR, IN THAT IF WE
HEARD A STORY ABOUT HOW OBAMA
HAD SEX WITH A PORN STAR
AND THEN PAID $130,000 TO COVER
IT UP,
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN BY FAR THE
LARGEST SCANDEL IN OBAMA'S
8 YEARS AND THE REPUBLICANS
WOULD'VE LOST THEIR MINDS.
OH MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
DISGRACE THE OFFICE.
BUT WE ARE PROGRESSIVES, WE DO
NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR PRIVATE
SEX LIFE, THAT'S BETWEEN YOU AND
THAT PERSON, SO WHY IS IT
IN ANY WAY RELEVANT?
ONE IS THAT IN THE SAME
TOURNAMENT THAT STORMY DANIELS
MET, LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE BY THE
WAY THAT THAT IS A FUN NAME, MET
DONALD TRUMP AND SLEPT
WITH HIM IN 2006,
ANOTHER OUT ADULT FILM ACTOR
JESSICA DRAKE SAID THAT
TRUMP HAD INVITED THEM UP TO
HIS, HER UP TO HIS HOTEL ROOM
AND SHE WENT WITH A COUPLE OF
FRIENDS BECAUSE SHE WAS A LITTLE
AFRAID OF HIM AND SHE WAS RIGHT,
SHE SAID TRUMP JUST GRABBED ME
AND KISSED ME WITHOUT ASKING FOR
PERMISSION AND NOW THIS IN SOME
WAYS CORROBORATES THIS, SAME
HOTEL ROOM, SAME GOLF TOURNAMENT
OTHER ADULT FILM STARS THERE,
OKAY, THAT'S RELEVANT.
IT GETS INTO ILLEGAL
BEHAVIOR.
AND THEN THE ONLY OTHER WAY THAT
IT IS RELEVANT AS THEY SAY,
LOOK, IN THE DOSSIER THEY SAY
THE RUSSIANS HAD INFORMATION
ABOUT TRUMP'S SEX LIFE AND THAT
TRUMP WANTS TO COVER THAT UP,
WELL HERE'S A STORY WHERE HE
PAYS $130,000 TO COVER UP A
STORY ABOUT HIS SEX LIFE, THAT
MAKES YOU GO, AND HE WAS WILLING
TO GO TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS
TO COVERED UP IN ONE
INSTANCE, IS IT POSSIBLE HE
WOULD DO IN ANOTHER?
IT'S A DATA POINT.
IT'S NOT OVERWHELMING OR AN OPEN
AND SHUT CASE.
NOT LIKE MOLARS CAN LOOK AT
THAT AND SAY WE'RE DONE WITH
THIS, GUILTY.
BUT IS A DATA POINT THAT HE
IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT
COVERING UP THE SEXUAL AFFAIRS
AND THAT IF THE RUSSIANS HAD ONE
ON HIM THAT WAS FAR WORSE, WHAT
WOULDN'T HE DO TO COVERED UP?
IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
AND THAT IS THE ONLY REASON IT
IS ON THE SHOW ESPECIALLY IN THE
FIRST HOUR IS THAT WHAT HAD BEEN
A HYPOTHETICAL, THAT HE COULD
BE BLACKMAILED FOR HIS PERSONAL
SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND IT COULD
THEORETICALLY INFLUENCE HIM
LATER ON IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL.
IF YOU BELIEVE THE SOURCES, IT
IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT.
HE CAN AND HAS BEEN BLACKMAILED
FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY.
THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO PUT
IT.
FINALLY, IF YOU'RE WONDERING, IS
IT REALLY TRUE?
FIRST OF ALL, SHE GAVE AN
INTERVIEW IN 2011 SAYING
IT'S TRUE WITH CORROBORATING
WITNESSES AND A POLYGRAPH.
WHICH I DON'T THINK IS
ADMISSIBLE IN COURT.
THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S DEFINITELY TRUE, BUT
SECOND OF ALL, STORMY DANIELS
ACTUALLY HASN'T COME ON
PUBLICANS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.
MICHAEL COHEN, THE SAME LAWYER
ALLEGEDLY PAID HER OFF SAID SHE
HE HAS A LETTER FROM HER THAT
SHE SIGNED AND HE SAID, HE SENT
IT TO THE PRESS AND THAT'S THE
LETTER THAT SAYS IT IS
DEFINITELY NOT TRUE, I NEVER
SLEPT WITH TRUMP BUT IN PART OF
THE LETTER IT SAYS, TRUST ME, IF
I HAD SLEPT WITH TRUMP AND I AM
LIKE, SHE DIDN'T WRITE THAT SO
SHE MIGHT HAVE SIGNED AS
PART OF SOME SORT OF PAYOFF, BUT
SHE DID NOT WRITE THAT LETTER.
CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE
SOME OF THIS, WHILE WE BELIEVE
THERE IS A NON-SALACIOUS
REASON TO COVER THIS GETS INTO
SEXUAL ACTIVITY WHERE THE
QUOTES ABOUT WHAT HE WAS LIKE IN
BED, WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT THAT
BUT I WANT TO BE FAIR TO HIM AND
COVER THE GOOD STUFF TOO,
HE DID SAY SOMETHING VERY SWEET
TO HER, HE COMPLEMENT AT HER.
HE SAID TO HER, AND THIS IS WHAT
SHE SAID IN SUCH MAGAZINE.
TRUMP SAID I WAS QUOTE JUST LIKE
HIS DAUGHTER.
THAT'S NICE, HE LOVES HIS
DAUGHTER AND HE THINKS SHE IS
ONE OF THE PEOPLE HE LOVES MOST
IN THE WORLD ARE
I HADN'T SEEN THAT, I WISH
YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THE
I'M JUST TRYING TO 
BE FAIR.
