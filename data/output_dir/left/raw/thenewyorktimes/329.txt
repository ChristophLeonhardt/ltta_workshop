1
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:05,856
“Trump!

2
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:06,832
Trump!

3
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:07,320
Trump!

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,808
Trump!

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:08,962
Trump!”

6
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:10,438
“Not my president!

7
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:11,212
“Not my president!

8
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:11,712
Not my —”

9
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,176
[sirens]

10
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:15,128
“Hear these words.

11
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:18,930
You will never be ignored again.”

12
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,942
“On inauguration day, I
was looking for Richard,

13
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,150
because I hadn’t met him yet.”

14
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:27,180
“I’ve given conferences for
ages, and we’ll usually

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,400
expect some protesters.”

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,360
“I was going around
looking for them

17
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,237
and I was walking past that
limousine that was on fire.

18
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,320
I got a phone call from
somebody that’s like, hey,

19
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,745
did you just see
Richard got punched?”

20
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,828
“Pepe has become a symbol —”

21
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:43,750
“I was pissed off because
I was like, oh my god,

22
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,330
if I had already found him
or I was already there,

23
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,709
that wouldn’t have happened.

24
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,500
I need to meet up with
Richard to make sure

25
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,791
that that doesn’t happen again.

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,480
That’s when I —

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,440
I knew I had to get serious.

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,859
And I knew we had
to professionalize.”

29
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,040
“A year ago, if
you had asked me, what

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,780
would you have been doing?

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,110
You could have given
me a million guesses

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,276
and I wouldn’t
have told you this.

33
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:22,420
Essentially, I went from
being an anonymous Twitter troll

34
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,350
to being an activism
leader of the alt-right,

35
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,520
all in the span of about nine months.”

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,950
“You will
not replace us.

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,108
You will not replace us.

38
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,910
You will not replace us.”

39
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,170
“Identity politics for white
people is my immediate goal.

40
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,340
And getting alt-right people
to push from the online world

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,918
to the real world
and take up space.”

42
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:51,201
“I’m Eli Mosley here
representing Identity Evropa

43
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:53,310
and the American alt-right.

44
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,230
We are here today to show the
establishment of this country

45
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,450
that they will not
remove white symbols

46
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,174
in an act of white iconoclasm.

47
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:04,350
The anti-white policies
of the left and the right

48
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,940
in this country come
together to oppress

49
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,622
our people and our interests.”

50
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:09,330
“Shame!

51
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,830
Shame!

52
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,330
Shame!

53
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,330
Shame!

54
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,830
Shame!

55
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,110
Shame!”

56
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,046
“You will not stop us from
representing our interests.

57
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:20,014
You will not replace us.

58
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,982
You will not replace us.

59
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:23,950
You will not replace us.

60
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,430
You will not replace us.”

61
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,512
“It’s a far more
fulfilling life —”

62
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:29,012
“Shame!

63
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:29,512
Shame!”

64
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:30,900
“You’re anti-white!”

65
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,800
“— than going through the
motions of a life that could be

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,880
anybody’s.”

67
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,110
A little over a year
ago, Elliott Kline

68
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,210
was living a dual life.

69
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,380
In his day job, he was an
entry level H.R. administrator,

70
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,760
but online, he was a
far-right-wing Twitter troll

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,950
troll who called himself
“The Jew Hunter.”

72
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,500
Here he is in a
podcast when he thought

73
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,470
only an alt-right
audience was listening.

74
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,940
Just a warning, you’re about to
hear some extremely offensive language

75
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,940
“I work in H.R. firing
niggers and spics all day.

76
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,620
Before that, I was
in the Army and I

77
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,180
got to kill Muslims for fun.

78
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,600
I’m not sure which
one was better,

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,289
watching niggers
and spics cry that

80
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,830
can’t feed their
little mud children,

81
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,499
or watching Muslims’
brains sprayed on the wall.

82
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,040
Honestly, both
probably suck compared

83
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,240
to listening to a kike
scream while being ovened.”

84
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,270
His trolling name
was Eli Mosley,

85
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,930
after Oswald Mosley, a
British fascist leader

86
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,950
and admirer of Adolf Hitler.

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,230
“Hail Trump.

88
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,300
Hail our people.

89
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,260
Hail victory.”

90
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,980
As the Trump campaign gave
way to a polarizing victory

91
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,950
and white nationalists
started coming out in public,

92
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,590
"Back the [expletive] up!”

93
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,940
Eli Mosley stepped away from
his keyboard into real life.

94
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,920
“Let’s go, start
lighting your torches.

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,888
Start lighting your torches.”

96
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:03,276
“Jews will
not replace us.

97
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,730
Jews will not replace us.”

98
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,239
He became a lead organizer

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,239
of the Unite the Right rally 
in Charlottesville.

100
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,470
“I’m about to send at
least 200 people with guns

101
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,310
to go get them out —”

102
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,184
“This is where violent
clashes have broken out

103
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:17,370
between white nationalists
and counterprotesters.”

104
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,610
“New video, you see it
here, of that deadly car attack,

105
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,589
the driver, charged with murder.”

106
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,570
“I think there’s
blame on both sides

107
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,920
and I have no doubt about it.

108
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,420
And you don’t have any
doubt about it, either.”

109
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,140
While some fled the
movement after the violence

110
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,350
in Charlottesville,
Eli leaned in.

111
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,020
“We are done with DACA.

112
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,070
We elected Donald Trump to —”

113
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,560
Soon after, he was
named head of one

114
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,930
of the largest groups
in the alt-right,

115
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,760
called Identity Evropa.

116
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,580
He’s taken on the air
of a polished spokesman,

117
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,970
dressing up his
despicable language.

118
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,850
Eli is happy to engage
the media when he thinks

119
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,500
he controls the narrative.

120
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,430
A middle-class kid from
suburban Pennsylvania,

121
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,610
he had opportunities in life.

122
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,490
But he went to several
colleges and never graduated.

123
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,100
He served in the
National Guard, but quit

124
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,380
before his contract was up.

125
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,880
Now he’s on a path where
past failures don’t matter.

126
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,890
He’s leading others like him —

127
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,910
disaffected white men who found
each other in the dark corners

128
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,570
of the online world.

129
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,070
His mission, to repackage
a racist worldview

130
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,868
and sell it to the
American public.

131
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,530
“All right, fellas,
here’s the scoop.

132
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,470
We got different
types of sandwiches.

133
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,000
So what we’re going to do is
you’re just going to take one

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,368
and don’t open it,
and if you don’t like it,

135
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,680
trade with somebody
else on the bus, O.K.?

136
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,665
I see there’s turkey and
this says club, so who knows.”

137
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:56,432
“Oh, I wish I
was in the land of cotton.”

138
00:05:56,432 --> 00:06:00,700
“Oh, I wish I
was in the land of cotton.”

139
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,040
“Old times
there are not forgotten.”

140
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,970
“Old times
there are not forgotten.”

141
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,830
“Look away, look
away, look away, Dixieland.”

142
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,100
“I wish I
was in Dixie, hooray, hooray.

143
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,140
In Dixie’s land I’ll take my
stand to live and die in Dixie.

144
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,745
Away, away, away
down south in Dixie.

145
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:29,070
Away, away, away, away
down south in Dixie.”

146
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,700
“All right, that was pretty good.

147
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,699
Do you want to do the
whole thing one more time?”

148
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,830
The alt-right’s basic strategy,
which they call “triggering,"

149
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,090
is to provoke a
reaction from the public

150
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,290
by stirring outrage and fear.

151
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,140
They think that if
their opponents then

152
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,980
respond aggressively,
even violently,

153
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,840
the alt-right may appear
less offensive in comparison.

154
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,662
Today, they’ve chosen
the ultimate trigger.

155
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:56,120
They’re returning
to the site where

156
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,760
they shook the nation
with a brazen display

157
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,950
of white supremacy.

158
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,590
They’re going back
to Charlottesville.

159
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,020
“Do not allow yourself
to get separated.

160
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,540
Do not allow yourself
to get isolated.

161
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,770
And even if you
do, do not panic.

162
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,600
The last time we
came to this city,

163
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,440
somebody got isolated
and shit got bad

164
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,610
and he panicked
when shit got bad.

165
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,410
And he is probably never going to leave

166
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,490
the state of Virginia alive.”

167
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,450
Some of these people were at
the last Charlottesville event.

168
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,940
And some are new recruits
still in their teens.

169
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,950
Some, like Eli, are
military veterans.

170
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,190
And they planned to the minute
how they’re getting in

171
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,908
and how they’re getting out.

172
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,655
“16-inch barrel.”

173
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,910
“No, that’s a 20-inch barrel.”

174
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,310
“Is it?”

175
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,015
“Should we be having
the cameras in here?

176
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:08,930
Whatever, fuck it.

177
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,202
What?”

178
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:19,040
“I’ll just sit right
here in the middle.”

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,400
“Yes.”

180
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,951
“O.K.”

181
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:23,950
“Does everybody have one?”

182
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,991
“Yep.”

183
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:25,490
“All right.”

184
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,870
“So I was in the Army
for about six years.

185
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,714
I joined when I was
17 and I was infantry.

186
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,730
I did become jaded in the
fact that I didn’t understand,

187
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,830
like why are we in Iraq.

188
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,540
And I saw it firsthand
how silly it was.”

189
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,590
“Is this what war felt like, Eli?”

190
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,140
“I was the driver.”

191
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,310
“Oh, you were the driver?”

192
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,060
“Actually, being in the
back of a seven-ton

193
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,392
is preferable to this, almost.”

194
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,240
“A lot of the people that I rely
on for security and logistics,

195
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,899
anything like that,
are former military.”

196
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,399
“All right.”

197
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,300
“Right, guys, out.”

198
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,662
“Left side, left side,
left side of the sidewalk.”

199
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:14,370
“Get on the sidewalk
on the left side.”

200
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,360
“Well, people expect that
people with our views

201
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,550
are going to come
out 400 pounds.

202
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,526
They call them white
trash or things like that.

203
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,650
And we’re kind of showing
that that’s not the case.

204
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,320
We are a group of well-mannered,
good-looking young white people

205
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,690
who have something to say.”

206
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:48,180
“We are here to represent
white America’s interests.

207
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,510
When polled, white
Americans do not agree

208
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,450
with what we see here —

209
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,640
this statue being
covered up and torn down

210
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,690
in front of all of these people
who are terrified to say it,

211
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,800
because of the evil R-word
they might be called.

212
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,655
No more.

213
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,140
Absolutely not.

214
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,120
This ends now.

215
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,595
We will be back.

216
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:12,575
We will be back.

217
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,555
We will be back.

218
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,040
We will be back.

219
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,530
We will be back.

220
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,850
Step it out.

221
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,659
All right, go, go, go, go,
double time, double time.

222
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:23,645
Let’s go.

223
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,124
Everyone, right now.

224
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:25,958
Walk it out.

225
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,082
If you are [unclear] in
front of the next person,

226
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:28,665
you are wrong.

227
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:29,561
Let’s move.”

228
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:39,914
“Hurry it up, 15, let’s go.”

229
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:40,839
“Let’s go.”

230
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,910
“Hey everyone, Charlottesville
3.0 was a great success

231
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,930
and it was a lot of fun.

232
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,680
We came, we triggered, we left.

233
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,770
We demonstrated that we
came in peace in May,

234
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,700
we came in peace in July,
we were badly mistreated.

235
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,850
And we came in peace tonight.

236
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,440
It was a great
success, and we’re —”

237
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,340
This event isn’t
for the few people

238
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,470
who happen to be at the park.

239
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,440
It’s for the world to witness.

240
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,230
Before long, the return
to Charlottesville

241
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,880
is trending on Twitter.

242
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,910
And the next day, it’s
all over the news.

243
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:21,780
“Donation basket —

244
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,580
Donations, donations, thank
you, thank you,

245
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,390
thank you, gentlemen.

246
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,495
Greatly appreciated.

247
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:27,370
Thank you, thank you.”

248
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,070
There are no reliable
numbers about the size

249
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:36,090
of the alt-right, let alone
how many veterans are involved.

250
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,400
That lack of
information allows them

251
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,180
to say whatever they
want about who they are.

252
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,830
“I went from Kuwait to
Baghdad back and forth,

253
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,270
and then we did a little
bit on the east border

254
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,410
over by Iran with those
[expletive] Shia [expletive],

255
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,270
you know what I'm talking about, 
those Shia militia people?”

256
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,320
On alt-right podcasts,
Eli portrayed himself

257
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,000
as a callous combat veteran.

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,640
“We’d rather a Chechen shoot
at us than a [expletive] —

259
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,170
be next to a Haji.”

260
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,840
But in our interviews, he’s
vague about his time in Iraq.

261
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Sorry, did you say
you were in Iraq?

262
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,340
“Yes.”

263
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,410
How long were you there?

264
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,070
“Only three — nine months.”

265
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,570
Oh.

266
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,797
Different than three.

267
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,630
“Well, I went there —

268
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,400
I went to Kuwait for a
little bit for three months,

269
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
and it wasn’t really Iraq.”

270
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,680
It’s the base.

271
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,554
“And then it was nine.

272
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:17,870
Yeah, yeah, exactly.”

273
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,370
Right.

274
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,800
“And it was towards the end part,

275
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,480
so the demobilization period.

276
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,170
Because I only graduated
high school in 2010.”

277
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:25,670
Right.

278
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,230
Will you just say in
a full sentence

279
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,202
how long you were in the Army?

280
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,422
"Hold on a sec.”

281
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,750
His accounts of
deployment didn’t add up.

282
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,750
And soon we’d find out why.

283
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,265
We contacted the Army to
get his military records.

284
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,229
Next on Eli’s agenda —

285
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,520
“University of Florida is
bracing for potential violence today

286
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,488
at a speech by white
nationalist leader Richard Spencer.”

287
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,510
He’s opening for Richard Spencer
on a so-called college tour.

288
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,970
“Officials at the state-run
University of Florida

289
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,940
initially turned down
Spencer’s request to speak,

290
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,850
but when he threatened a
First Amendment lawsuit,

291
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,120
administrators relented.”

292
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,100
“[expletive]”

293
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,570
“[expletive]”

294
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,020
“[expletive]”

295
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,050
Claiming free speech rights,
Spencer and his group

296
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,510
target a public university.

297
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,295
The governor declares a
state of emergency

298
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:24,715
and media from across the country

299
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,905
comes to cover the controversy.

300
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,628
“Just so you know, there are
metal detectors around here,

301
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:30,919
so make sure you have nothing
on the prohibited list.

302
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,860
They’ll hand it to
you there next to you.”

303
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,620
“Our movement was once
an atomized, autonomous

304
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,420
and aimless individuals.

305
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,250
This November it will
be one year since I

306
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,890
made the leap into meeting
others in the alt-right.

307
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,510
I’ve gone on podcasts, I’ve argued
with people in debate groups,

308
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,020
but I’ve never given a
live political speech.

309
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,540
I’m not really nervous,
I’m just excited. [expletive]

310
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,190
And I’m also spilling
water all over Richard’s bed.”

311
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,640
No Nazis, no K.K.K.,
no fascist U.S.A.

312
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,207
No Nazis, no K.K.K.,
no fascist U.S.A.”

313
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,309
“Move back up little bit.

314
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,350
Back up so they can work.

315
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,170
Please back it up.

316
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,740
Please, everybody, back up.”

317
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,236
“I was denied entrance
to this event

318
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,110
because I have phone
numbers on my arm, which

319
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,070
they know is a tactic
that protesters

320
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,375
use in case they’re arrested.”

321
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,420
“Like, right now like I got
racially profiled trying

322
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,890
to go in, because
apparently we don't fit

323
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,645
the Caucasian stereotype 
of how we should look.”

324
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,688
“Any time, any place.

325
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:33,672
Punch a
Nazi in the face.”

326
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,648
“Which side of
history are you on?

327
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:39,624
Which side of
history are you on?”

328
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:48,672
“Allow me to speak.

329
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,782
And then we'll have 
a conversation afterwards.

330
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:52,629
What do you think about that?“

331
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:53,819
“Go home, Spencer.

332
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,488
Go home, Spencer.”

333
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:57,976
“Are you adults?

334
00:14:57,976 --> 00:15:00,952
Are you adults?

335
00:15:00,952 --> 00:15:03,432
Are you ready to
think for yourselves?

336
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:04,920
It doesn’t look like it.”

337
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:11,368
“O.K., Hi, Mr. Dick Spencer.

338
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,352
Thanks for coming.

339
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:17,400
I’d like to introduce myself
as Eman Elshahawy,

340
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,732
and my ethnicity is
Egyptian and Puerto Rican.

341
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:24,186
And I am a beautiful
brown woman here today.

342
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:28,154
And I guess my
question for you is,

343
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:31,626
how did it feel to get
punched in the face on camera?”

344
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,844
“It hurt.

345
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,010
Yeah, it hurts when someone
punches you in the face.

346
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,010
Is that a real question?”

347
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,986
“Yeah, how bad did it hurt,

348
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:51,466
like, did you [expletive] your jaw?”

349
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,150
“Hey, excuse me, Egyptian
Puerto Rican woman

350
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,520
that just asked the question.

351
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,020
I have an answer
for you, actually,

352
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,520
from the third-person
perspective.

353
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,920
I was in D.C. the day that
Richard got punched.

354
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,546
And that day changed
my life, and it

355
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,670
changed hundreds of people
who are white Americans’

356
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,050
lives that day, when
they fundamentally

357
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,290
realized that this country
did not belong to us

358
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,790
and that we were going to have
to fight for what we believed

359
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,430
in and fight for our people.

360
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,628
So you can thank
yourselves and all

361
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:23,318
of your celebrations of violence
for why we are here today,

362
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:25,286
because we are
fundamentally reacting

363
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:26,762
to what you have said and done.”

364
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:38,650
“I never really kind
of got anything

365
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:47,230
when I was Elliott Kline,
until I became Eli Mosley.

366
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,881
Eli Mosley was able to
find that sense of purpose

367
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,130
that I was always looking for.

368
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:59,290
Yeah, it was a little
obnoxious trying

369
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,030
to give a speech with 600
people screaming at you.”

370
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,510
“To struggle, friends.”

371
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,740
“To struggle.”

372
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,560
“However, the audio came in
just fine over the internet

373
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,770
and millions of people are
going to see what we said.”

374
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,880
“I gave a speech
yesterday and now Twitter

375
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,060
has removed my
account completely.

376
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,440
When you go to
tweet, you hit tweet,

377
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,150
‘Your account is
currently suspended.

378
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,366
For more information,
go to Twitter.com.’”

379
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:33,960
The social media platforms that
initially allowed the alt-right

380
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,450
to flourish are
starting to stifle it.

381
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,220
Twitter is cracking down,
sporadically, on hate speech,

382
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,330
banning some accounts affiliated
with white nationalism.

383
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,327
“I’ve been banned maybe 20
times at this point, now.

384
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:50,410
And they don’t understand.

385
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,910
No, you shut us down,
we come right back.

386
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,170
You shut us down,
we come right back.

387
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,320
We’re not going anywhere.

388
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,110
Every time I get an
account shut down,

389
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,090
I’m making a new
one the next day.”

390
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,600
Elliott Kline’s Army
documents arrive.

391
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,290
The story they tell is
far different from the one

392
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,390
he created.

393
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,930
Turns out, he never deployed —

394
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,640
not to Iraq, not anywhere.

395
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,770
Elliott Kline spent 
about six years

396
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,350
in the Pennsylvania
National Guard,

397
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,510
coming in to train
one weekend a month

398
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,410
and for some weeks
over the summers.

399
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,220
Two soldiers from his
unit also confirmed

400
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,660
that he never deployed.

401
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,090
The Army tells me that
you did not deploy.

402
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,690
“The Army tells you?”

403
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,500
Yeah.

404
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,685
So did you go to Iraq?

405
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,010
“I was in Kuwait.

406
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,810
I told you that before.”

407
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,252
You told me you went to Kuwait
and then you went to Iraq.

408
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:55,125
“Well, they’re — they’re — 
basically, it’s the —

409
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,730
it’s very similar,
the way it works.”

410
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,730
So what were the dates
that you were there?

411
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:09,120
“Um, let me think.

412
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,620
Hold on, I’m trying to find out.

413
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,600
Um, 2012, I believe,
but I’ve got to look.”

414
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,550
Because the last troops left
Iraq in the end of 2011.

415
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,860
The facts don’t seem
to matter to Eli.

416
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,320
But maybe that’s
the kind of person

417
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,880
who becomes a leader
in this movement.

418
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,550
The more that people like
him come out into the open,

419
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,560
the more they
reveal the alt-right

420
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,267
for what it really is.

421
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:48,950
“ — was
in Dixie, hooray, hooray.”

422
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,760
It’s a movement where 30
people with cheap tiki torches

423
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,260
can seem like an army in the
echo chamber of social media,

424
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,590
where white men claim
to be the real victims,

425
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,250
and where a weekend warrior
can pass himself off

426
00:20:04,250 --> 00:00:00,000
as a disillusioned
veteran of war.
