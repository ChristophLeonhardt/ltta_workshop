1
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:06,960
He’s the one who
famously said,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,979
"I'd take a bullet
for Donald Trump."

3
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:11,542
Well, now that he’s
looking at prison time

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,250
we’ll see if he’s
willing to take a dick.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,169
People think that prisoners
deserve whatever they get.

6
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:26,190
A police report described him
as 5-foot-9 and 140 pounds.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,495
Or as his cellmate
put it, just right.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,570
I was forced to
perform oral sex

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,090
on several inmates. 
I was told:

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,460
"You aren’t going to fight back, 
are you sweetness?"

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,160
You're going to be going back 
to the showers.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,760
And the only speed you’re going to reach is 88 dudes per hour.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,670
Someone’s going through that now.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,810
Someone's going through that right now.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,070
And to make a joke about it,

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,200
it’s a slap in the face.

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,350
Being raped or sexually assault in prison

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,169
is not part of the punishment.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,680
No one deserves that.

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,205
We’re still human beings.

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,620
There’s no guards that sit right here.

22
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:27,780
There’s nothing.

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,750
There was nothing.

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,578
It's like they had to to come from way over here,

25
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:31,578
which is the booking area,

26
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:34,000
to come and see anything
that was going on in here.

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,470
–Hey.

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,650
–Meg, what the hell are you doing in here?

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,850
–Shower time.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,020
–What are you doing with that loofah?

31
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:41,935
–Don't worry about it.

32
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,590
I was taking a shower
and in comes a guy.

33
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,770
Cartoon character: (screaming)
You told me not to worry about it.

34
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,130
He says, "Bitch, face
the fucking wall.

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,810
Or I'll break your fucking neck."

36
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,220
I felt like dirt. I felt like I
didn’t even exist.

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,290
I was just there.

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,800
My bunk was tapped by a
guy who then explained

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,400
to me that he owned
me.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,040
He had purchased me

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,070
from the guy who
anally raped me

42
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,740
for $20 worth of
commissary items.

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,990
And I was now his property.

44
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,110
He was my prison husband.
If he wanted to utilize

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,390
me to pay off gambling debts,

46
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,290
I could be bartered.

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,770
Talking to staff would

48
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,640
have been the end of my life.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,650
Staff actually
came on the tier,

50
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,570
and my husband was saying,
"Watch what I can make my ho do,"

51
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,250
and he made me dance for him
and the staff members.

52
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,690
They all laughed about it.

53
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,820
Staff shook his head
and walked out the door.

54
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,150
Like, “Oh, man, y’all crazy.”

55
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,695
Next up is Pearl,

56
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:59,320
A.k.a. Lil’ Bitch.

57
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,850
I wonder who Big Bitch is.

58
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,570
That would be me.

59
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,810
Lucky you.

60
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,090
I had to sit down to urinate.

61
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,940
I had to face the
wall to shower.

62
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,190
I was not allowed at
any point in time

63
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,110
to have any mention
of me being a man

64
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,720
or having a penis.

65
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,220
I had to wear a tucker
to pull back the genitals

66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,210
to give the appearance
of a vagina.

67
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,120
It’s extremely painful
to wear most of the time.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,350
I had to wear it all of the time.
May just be as simple as me

69
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,920
raising my voice and
getting smacked, to me

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,860
referring to myself as a
he and getting punched.

71
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,150
Any type of deviation
from his rules

72
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,460
were the threat of violence.

73
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,230
I lost me here.

74
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,150
I lost my humanity here.
I lost my identity here.

75
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,037
I lost myself here.

76
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:05,370
So the memories
are coming back,

77
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,640
so you’re mad and it’s like I’m
angry or something, at the building.

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,160
It’s a weird feeling.
And the people

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,220
who can make the change,

80
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,100
the people who can affect the
change make jokes about it.

81
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,850
If the story is heard,

82
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,580
and it’s addressed,
and we can stop

83
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,532
making the joke of
it, someone won’t have

84
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:30,990
to go through this
one day. Someone

85
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,400
can go to prison,
do their time.

86
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,860
They can rectify
their mistake, they

87
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,960
can get their second chance.

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,420
We have to start
thinking of it like that.

89
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,840
They are people,
they are just people

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:00:00,000
and no person deserves that.
