00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
when I grew up in the bar way I lived in

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,990
a place where weekends were reserved for

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,649
funerals

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,240
funerals of people who are dying from a

<font color="#E5E5E5">type it was the treatment</font>

6
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:24,480
on this 20th<font color="#E5E5E5"> anniversary of World AIDS</font>

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,669
Day I think it's appropriate to look

8
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:28,890
back for a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to when this day was</font>

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,399
first observed

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,970
this year's slogan stop aids keep the

00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,240
promise is a time limit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the Apostle</font>

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,190
Paul's letter to the Corinthians he

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,620
asked if the trumpet does not sound a

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,520
clear call who will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for battle</font>

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,320
we as leaders must continue to sound

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that call and encourage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others to see</font>

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves as leaders in this fight and</font>

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,300
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> must reaffirm our own commitment to</font>

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,090
confront and defeat this disease once

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,540
and firm

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,980
AIDS is the most important wedge we've

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,690
had to drive for it a much more

23
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,800
ambitious agenda which is basic health

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:59,290

he's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime oh yeah to see see see</font>

26
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,530
students really don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of</font>

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,660
do they can point to some of the

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,250
problems that others would like to see

30
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,020
hidden away or problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

31
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,850
neglected just threw in attention

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,780
what they meant was we ride that into

the battlefield<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the battle we're</font>

36

improve medical care for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people living</font>

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,530
in poverty activism has played a huge

39
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">role and speeding up this process</font>

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,420
without losing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of</font>

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,520
quality and I think moving forward we

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,780
have to find a way to harness that

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,130
energy into this broader goal which is

44
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">basic health care for people living and</font>
