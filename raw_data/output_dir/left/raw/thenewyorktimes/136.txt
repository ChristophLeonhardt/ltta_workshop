[music]

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:05,070
I know words.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,180
I have the best words.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,164
[music]

5
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:13,430
I’m a cleanliness freak.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,980
I love washing my
hands before I eat.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,260
And you go to a restaurant,
and you wash your hands,

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,320
and you sterilize everything,
and the water’s nice and hot.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,810
And then you wash them again.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,330
And then you go to the
table, and you sit down.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,540
And a guy walks out, and
he says, hey, Mr. Trump.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,409
How are you doing?

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,380
I’m a fan of yours.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,505
And he sticks out his hand.

15
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,790
And then four or five
other people come out.

16
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,470
And sometimes you’re
not in the mood

17
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,840
to shake hands with
everybody and to say hello

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,600
to everybody.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,325
And you really just
don’t want to do it.

20
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:46,650
[screaming]

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,810
But the only good thing is
you tend not to eat as much.

22
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:00,000
