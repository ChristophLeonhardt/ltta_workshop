ABC cancels the Roseanne show and conservatives are not happy ABC cancels Roseanne Barr show the Roseanne show incredibly incredibly highly watched something like twenty nine million viewers for the premiere because of an offensive tweet bar leveled at former Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett now I found the tweet vile I found the tweet reprehensible but did the punishment fit the crime now what bar tweeted on Twitter the Twitter the tweet has now been deleted is it she tweeted quote Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby equals VJ Valerie Jarrett look a lot of people now bar is claiming gonna tell you what she's claiming she's claiming on Twitter that she did not know that Valerie Jarrett was black he thought she was white Iranian and many people think that Valerie Jarrett is in fact black she's just light-skinned she's from Chicago her parents worked in Iran her dad was a an executive and working with the diplomatic corps for some years over in Iran there are plenty of ways to attack Valerie Jarrett there are plenty of ways to attack the Left race it always be left out of it Valerie Jarrett has ties to Louis Farrakhan she has ties to Linda Sarsour to the Muslim Brotherhood some very very bad actors and Roseanne and conservatives in general would be for better served dispensing with the stupidity the racist undertones and attacking on the merits the Democrats give us such solid ammunition and we waste it be throw it away but to this story though bar is now apologizing now I I don't know rosanne well but we know each other we interface on social media she's a conservative celebrity I've been on conference calls with her I've spoken with other groups of conservatives in the media industry on those calls she's been present so we're not friends we know each other we know of one another I don't find Roseanne to be a racist I don't find Roseann to be a bad person I was highly offended many years back when she gave that terribly disrespectful rendition of the national anthem and she's reinvented herself as a conservative in Hollywood and I'll admit maybe it's hypocritical I'm willing to forgive some past transgressions because we need to win the culture war and when we have mega stars like Roseanne with these cult followings or the decades and they're finally on the right they've left the left they're on the right we need to embrace them we really really need to embrace them we need it so it's highly disappointing for me that Roseanne did this but does the punishment fit the crime we're gonna get into that we're gonna get into that with people like Joy Reed and Keith Olbermann and Gemelli Hill from ESPN things they've said things they've done rappers and their lyrics how highly racist and misogynistic and sexual and calling for rape and murder and using the n-word any discriminately we're gonna get into the double standard but first let's talk about abc's response ABC immediately moved to cancel Roseanne now I don't believe it was over one tweet I think that ABC disney has put ideology over profits I believe that when Roseanne became too conservative constantly siding with President Trump on Twitter and Facebook the subject matter of her show clearly her character anyway pro-trump Pro conservatives Pro conservative economic message the powers that be at ABC the Liberals in Hollywood were aghast and they needed but rein that in and I truly believe even if it's subconsciously they needed a reason to get rid of Roseanne despite 29 million premiere viewers and consistently high ratings each episode now Roseanne did an immediate Maher culpa and she apologized and she said you didn't give it much thought I was reading one of her tweets just a little bit before the show today he said I really genuinely thought Valerie Jarrett was white I believe that uh Roseanne roat's I apologize I am NOT leaving Twitter but she came back on and I and many others said you not leave Twitter he made a mistake he said in a series of late-night tweet is blaming ambien the prescription sleeping pill ambien and she also criticized ABC for what she says his Network hypocrisy and I'm reading from a fox news article but these are Roseanne's for Batum tweets she said quote guys I did something unforgivable so do not defend me it was 2:00 in the morning and I was am being tweeting it was Memorial Day - I went too far and do not want to defend it it was egregious and indefensible I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but don't defend it please thank you no I agree with that I agree with Roseanne tweeting that I will also tell you this there was a time when I had trouble sleeping my doctor prescribed me ambien and it was one prescription and I asked my doctor never give me ambien again because ambien I hallucinate 'add like it was bizarre and unsettling on ambien so do I believe that if she took an ambien it was possible she did this I do and and did it inadvertently I do but do I also agree that it was indefensible and Roseanne's a grown woman very wealthy very intelligent I I agree with that as well but I don't think should have been fired now the rebooted episode it says the episode attracted more than 18 million viewers The Drudge Report actually reported worldwide 29 million let's go with the low estimate of 18 million those are still earth-shattering ratings I mean it is just earth-shattering she then tweeted I think Joe Rogan is right about ambien Joe Rogan the comedian the MMA guy and especially on Netflix I think Joe Rogan is right about ambien not giving a kiss excuses for what I did parentheses tweeted but I've done weird stuff while on ambien cracked eggs on the wall at 2:00 a.m. I will tell you a quick story I took an ambien in 2003 I remember this vividly we're talking 15 years ago had that much wine before bed and I woke up and I was at a friend's home up in the mountains under the nice home but they had some deer heads on the wall and I vividly remember those deer heads talking that's how much ambien messed me up I never wanted add meat again after that it was it is a very very strong sleeping girl and she doubled down hearing to blame ambien again she then said don't feel sorry for me guys this is Roseann tweeting I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people and wonderful writers all liberals and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet I'll be on Joe Rogan's podcast Friday now Viacom then went a step further and pulled all of the old Roseanne show's Roseanne also Roseanne also issued a statement and her statement was as follows I deeply regret my comments from late last night on Twitter above all I want to apologize to Valerie Jarrett as well as to ABC and the cast and crew of the Roseanne show I am sorry for making a thoughtless joke that does not reflect my values I love all people and I'm very sorry today my words caused hundreds of hard-working people to lose their jobs I also sincerely apologize to the audience that has embraced my work for decades I apologize from the bottom of my heart and hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me now what Valerie Jarrett could have done was immediately said ABC do not fire her I laughed it off two or all political figures we punch each other because the left has been vicious to the right ABC Gator spank Roseanne on the rest suspended the show for two weeks now obviously show was taped it's all been filmed but the optics of it Roseanne's gonna be off the air for a month or two weeks Roseanne could have issued a series of apologies during that month or two weeks she could have gone to diversity training and sensitivity training and held the workshop the whole thing would have blown over hundreds of people would have retained their jobs I don't believe ABC wanted Roseanne on the air any longer because she was a conservative now the bigger problem is the bigger problem is the double standard let's talk about ABC doc murphy on twitter at real jack tweeted good tweet Kimmel mock Melania Trump's accent Jimmy Kimmel true joy behar on the view called vice president Mike Pence mentally ill for having a strong Christian faith Bill Maher makes racist comments left right and center keith olbermann has used effing this and effing that and call the president all of his supporters effing nazis nick short our good friend nick short a really good political and national security reporter get an incredible graphic and it's i've retweeted it on my twitter page on card L by Twitter timeline at John Carr Dylan numerous times where he took headlines of all of the times Heath Olbermann has gone on unhinged rants and used pejoratives email a hill over at ESPN went on racist rants to call the president the United States a white supremacist joy weed over at MSNBC has a history of blogging homophobic anti-hispanic anti-latino anti-semitic content it's all been uncovered joy read still has a job Jimmy Kimmel still has a job Bill Maher still has a job Joy Behar still has a job Heath Olbermann is hired by ESPN a subsidiary of ABC disney the same week Roseanne is fired for one tweet demo Behar Oberman Jamela Hill ESPN joy Reid MSNBC all of them a history comment upon comment upon comment read upon tweet blog post upon blog post Facebook post upon Facebook post racist vile insulting they all have jobs they faced no problems roseanne one tweet one tweet her show is canceled hundreds of people are fired again not excusing the tweet not excusing it the tweet was vile but her apologies are sufficient now Valerie Jarrett said make Roseanne's Rice's make Roseanne's racism controversy a teaching moment and Jarrett coincidentally was slated to appear uh it was a pre-taped MSNBC Town Hall he said quote I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment I'm fine I'm worried about all the people out there I don't have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense ah Jared should have been a little more stand-up than that now Disney is suffering solo their film about Han Solo did very poorly at the box office and with this cancellation of Rosanna Disney shares ABC disney obviously the parent company of ABC networks that Erin Roseanne their shares dropped 2.4 percent on this news this is uh indicative of a much larger issue though and like I said earlier I believe I truly believe they're putting their political agenda over their profits I don't believe they care about profits they needed to silence Roseanne now the we've seen some archived blog PO over the years let me read you a couple of things Jory Reed has written on her a blog the Reid report quote you believe the Jews were oppressed why should the Palestinian Muslims have to pay the price you oppressed them this is her siding with former Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a guy that called for a second Holocaust you oppressed them so give a part of Europe to the Zionist regime so they can establish a government we would support it that's joy read we also accused wolf blitzer a CNN's Wolf Blitzer of being too Zionist of being too friendly the Jewish people she also attacked Mexicans she attacked homosexuals and enjoy read wrote on Monday April 4th 2005 it's good to be a celebrity because you can be really really disgusting and still have a shot at keeping your Bob and that was on read blog the read report blogged her blog he also defended Mike Tyson after he was accused of rape so she's she's um she's been vile vile now here's another blog post in which she attacks Jews and Latinos it's just that there is a tremendous taboo in the United States about saying anything even remotely negative about Israel or I'm about implying dual loyalty when it comes to a Jewish American it would simply isn't done because it would expose the speaker to charges of anti-semitism Latinos have not gotten to the place yet where they are essentially immune immunized from over at criticism but keep in mind that those who criticize the waving blah blah blah and she goes on and basically saying that Latinos are now becoming such a large part of the population that will soon be able to criticize them as well joy Reid has a history of things far worse than Roseanne Dorie Reid has consistently been given a pass he'd been given a pass she even lied and said it wasn't my blog and then people pulled the wagon web archives and they proved that it was her blog and then forensic analysis said no nobody went in and changed anything it was your blog you wrote it and then her lame excuse was oh maybe I did I don't remember writing it yeah but you know what a liberal he's an african-american liberal so she gets a pass he gets a pass roseann though is excoriated shamed off-air and hundreds p a hundreds of people worked on our show are fired there is a glaring a glaring double-standard now like I said earlier it was very stupid of Roseann the racist connotation was clearly there and there were so many things on which to attack Valerie Jarrett Valerie Jarrett is terrible woman shades the United States attack Valerie Jarrett on her long ties via the Chicago Democratic machine who be a vile racist Louis Farrakhan a terrorist attack Valerie Jarrett for holding a woman's breakfast to which every year she invites Linda Sarsour another radical Muslim who which she invites black activists whose support top killers there are so many things on which you can attack Valerie Jarrett legitimately I don't know looks I don't her race that's stupid it's stupid it's inappropriate it makes us look bad we on the right lose when we get into the gutter like that what we do is we prove all of the false allegations the left levels as we went to reprove them because they're false but we we validate them and we shouldn't we're not racist on the right the right is probably the most open-minded movement on the planet we want everybody to do well nothing would make me happier as a conservative then everyone of every race succeeding because if everyone of every race succeeded we'd have more money in our economy our GDP would be 34 trillion not 17 trillion no one in the world could touch us I would love to see every african-american in this nation making well over the median national income I would love to see graduation rates for black Americans at a hundred percent from high school in college who wouldn't I would like to see that for every race it only makes our nation stronger crime would be reduced poverty would be eradicated little kids wouldn't go to sleep hungry it wouldn't be dying of diseases because they get thrown have adequate health care they can't get to the doctor their parents would know better they'd be able to support them that's of every race of every race liberals don't want that liberals want to keep people of color on the public dole they want them to have as little as possible as little as possible to barely scrape by but really not they want to also have them dependent on government to give them that handout give them that handout eat them just enough make their kids hungry then and make them beg for that handout again and give it to them liberalism is a sinister philosophy a sinister philosophy couldn't have Rosanne out there preaching conservatism you couldn't have Roseanne portraying a working-class family not a wealthy family a working-class family that supports conservatism you can't have that and that's what I believe in the end the cancellation of her show was really about the public shaming of her was really about it wasn't about one stupid tweet who which there were a million different ways to punish her and have her do mea culpa that the audience would have been fine with forgotten about in three days no no this was all about a grand scale attempt a shame and silent conservatism this Roseanne story is a very important story about the double standards in our society no one is excusing Roseanne's tweet I thought it was Viola thought it was reprehensible I said so very publicly but liberals have gotten a pass for the same thing we need to bring you these stories every day so help us keep doing that by
