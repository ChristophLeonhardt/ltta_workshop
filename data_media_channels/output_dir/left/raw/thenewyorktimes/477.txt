1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,941
We're at a drug treatment
program in Vancouver, Canada.

2
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,909
Where John Pinkney is injecting
himself with

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,845
prescription grade heroin.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,180
this program is for users 
who haven't been able to

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,982
get clean using other methods.

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,452
It has taken away the
need to have to

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,521
go out and try to get 
high all the time,

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,190
try to get money to pay for it.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,059
That's exactly the program's
goal.

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,628
It helps minimize the
health and crime related issues

11
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,280
that can come with heroin
addiction.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,300
If there's any medical
emergencies or any difficulties

13
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,603
they're right there to help you.
They're very polite

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,338
and courteous that way.

15
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,839
In 2003 Vancouver opened the

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,043
first supervised injection site
in North America.

17
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,412
Since then many others have
popped up to deal with the

18
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,782
recent increase in fatal drug
overdoses.

19
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,550
Here people use street heroin

20
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,453
while volunteers stand by ready
to help.

21
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,026
Critics say this approach just

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,629
enables people like John to
keep using drugs,

23
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,698
while advocates say it keeps
everyone safer.

24
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:09,469
I just really hope that they start 
getting more clinics out there.

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,871
Because there is a need, 
look how many people are dying.

26
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,241
This year alone is, I think,
the most we’ve ever had die.

27
00:01:15,241 --> 00:00:00,000
And there’s no need for that,
especially in this day and age.
