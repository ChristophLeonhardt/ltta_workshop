And everything nice.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,700
These were the ingredients chosen to
create the perfect little girl.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,540
But Professor Utonium accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,380
Chemical X.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,160
Thus, The Powderpuff Girls were born!

Buttercup!

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,480

>> BUTTERCUP: What's up? I'm Buttercup.

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,939
>> BLOSSOM: I love my sisters.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,940
>> BUTTERCUP: We're not even sisters! Why am I here?

17
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,940
>> BUBBLES: I love flying with them...

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,780
>> BUTTERCUP: It's hard flying with these hoes.

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,740
>> BLOSSOM: But, I don't really like Buttercup that much.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,980
>> BUBBLES: I just don't like Blossom.

21
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,440
>> BUTTERCUP: I can not stand Bubbles! That [bleep] is dumb!

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,340
>> BLOSSOM: As you all know, I'm the leader.

23
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,200
>> BUBBLES: She thinks she's the leader because of her bow.

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,340
>> BLOSSOM: Okay.

25
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,320
>> BUBBLES: [Bleep].

26

>> BUTTERCUP: You all don't understand how dumb Bubbles is.

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,580
You notice hoe eats her hair?

33
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,880
You know what time Bubbles flew to the
wrong [bleep] fight.

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
We was in Paris.

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,360
This [bleep] is in Spain.

36
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,720
She likes to help old people cross the street.

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,840
She's dumb...

38
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,180
>> BUBBLES: You look great! And you know what? Life is so beautiful.

39
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,360

There!

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,800
So you have to look both sides...

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,360
>> BLOSSOM: I really, really, think that we should kick Buttercup out of our sisterhood.

43

>> BUTTERCUP: What she say?

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,660
>> BLOSSOM: She really needs to calm down. She's always talking about "killing [bleep]."

45
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,700
>> BUTTERCUP: Imma kill this [bleep]!

46
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,940
>> BLOSSOM: We have super powers. You don't need a glock!

47
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,030
>> BUTTERCUP: I don't need to use my powers! I got a glock!

48
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,760
>> BLOSSOM: She's a little aggressive.

49
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,720

Mother [bleep]! Didn't I save you?

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,099
Give me your wallet.

53
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,240
Say "Thank you Buttercup."

54
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,140
