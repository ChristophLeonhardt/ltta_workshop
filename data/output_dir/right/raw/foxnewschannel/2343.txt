1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,803
NOT JUST DEFENSE.

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:03,404
>> Martha: FASCINATING.

3
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:04,138
MARK PENN, THANK YOU VERY

4
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:04,438
MUCH.

5
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,239
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE

6
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:05,573
TONIGHT.

7
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:08,409
>> THANK YOU.

8
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,109
>> Martha: DULING EDITORIALS

9
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,045
THIS EVENING.

10
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,947
MY NEXT GUEST IS PRESIDENT

11
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:15,115
TRUMP OVER HANDLING THIS

12
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:15,583
PROBE.

13
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,084
KIM STROSSEL WRITES THIS

14
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,218
TRUMP CAN DEFINE THE TERMS

15
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,320
OF THIS DEBATE AND DEFEND

16
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,721
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND HE

17
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,222
CAN ENLIGHTEN THE COUNTRY.

18
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,625
BUT IS TIME FOR DOING SO

19
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,626
PRODUCTIVE SOLID GROWING

20
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,794
VERY SHORT.

21
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,295
"WALL STREET JOURNAL"

22
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:28,996
COLUMNIST KIM STRASSEL JOINS

23
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:29,597
US NOW.

24
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,431
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

25
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:36,203
>> HI, MARTHA.

26
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,671
YOU SAY THEY HAVE TO

27
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,239
APPROACH THIS FROM A

28
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:39,907
CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE.

29
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:40,240
EXPLAIN.

30
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,008
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING

31
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,443
ABOUT HOW THERE SEEMS TO BE

32
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,711
NO THERE THERE ON THE

33
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,345
COLLUSION QUESTION.

34
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,513
THE HOUSE REPORT IS NOW OUT.

35
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,715
BY ALL REPORTING MR. MUELLER

36
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,083
HAS NOT FOUND ANYTHING THERE

37
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:49,416
EITHER.

38
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,584
SO THE REPORTS NOW SAY HE IS

39
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,052
MOVING TO THE QUESTION OF

40
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,153
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

41
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,989
THAT REQUIRES AN ENTIRELY

42
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,256
NEW LEGAL APPROACH, ONE THAT

43
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,425
GOES RIGHT AT THAT

44
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,026
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.

45
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,761
BECAUSE YOU TALK TO ANY

46
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,595
CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER, THEY

47
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,297
WILL SAY THAT A PRESIDENT

48
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:06,233
CANNOT BE CONSTRUED TO HAVE

49
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,301
OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE WHILE HE

50
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,502
WAS IN THE PROCESS OF

51
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,603
ENGAGING IN CORE

52
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,304
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS.

53
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,173
AND THAT INCLUDES FIRING

54
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,508
SUBORDINATES AND DIRECTING

55
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,710
LAW ENFORCEMENT LIKE

56
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,144
MR. COMEY.

57
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,512
>> Martha: YOU KNOW, ONE OF

58
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,613
THE THINGS I FIND

59
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,048
INTERESTING WE HAVEN'T HEARD

60
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,049
DIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY FROM

61
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:22,783
ROBERT MUELLER ON THIS.

62
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,418
ONE OF HIS SPOKES PEOPLE

63
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,486
SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT

64
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,520
OF, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU READ

65
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,888
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING,

66
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,423
DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE

67
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,157
EVERYTHING THAT YOU READ,

68
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,191
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LEAKING

69
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,527
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN

70
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,628
THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL

71
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,295
INVESTIGATION.

72
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,631
AND, YOU KNOW, ALSO SAID

73
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,666
THEY WILL ISSUE AT THE END

74
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,801
OF A REPORT.

75
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,935
THAT IS WHAT THIS IS LEADING

76
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,403
UP TO.

77
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,370
THIS IS NOT LEADING UP TO

78
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,405
SOME SORT OF INDICTMENT.

79
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,839
IT'S LEADING UP TO MUELLER

80
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,508
RELEASING A REPORT.

81
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,876
PROBABLY ALONG THE LINES OF

82
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,244
WHAT WE HEARD JAMES COMEY DO

83
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,713
BACK IN JULY BEFORE THE

84
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,080
ELECTION.

85
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,548
TO SAY HERE'S WHAT I LOOKED

86
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:54,815
AT.

87
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,316
THIS KIND OF LOOKS LIKE IT

88
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,284
COULD BE ON DESTRUCTION OF

89
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:57,618
JUSTICE.

90
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,253
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE

91
00:01:59,253 --> 00:01:59,620
WHATEVER.

92
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,188
YOU KNOW, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT

93
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,089
HE IS GOING TO SAY.

94
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,323
WHAT'S THE PROCESS THERE?

95
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,825
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT

96
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,094
TO COME OUT OF THAT REPORT

97
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:11,799
ONCE IT HITS THE AIR?

98
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,434
>> WE HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE

99
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,468
THEY HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY

100
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,936
QUIET ON WHAT THAT REPORT

101
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,870
WILL LOOK LIKE.

102
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,872
BUT THIS IS WHY IT'S SO

103
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:24,678
IMPORTANT FOR THE TRUMP TEAM

104
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,346
TRUMP LAWYERS TO GO TO A

105
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,881
FEDERAL COURT GET

106
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,816
DECLARATORY JUDGMENT FROM

107
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,184
THAT COURT THAT HOLDS THAT

108
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,286
PRESIDENTS CANNOT BE HELD ON

109
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,187
OBSTRUCTION WHEN EXERCISING

110
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:33,821
CORE FUNCTIONS.

111
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,089
YOU PUT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

112
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,123
ON NOTICE THAT THAT IS NOT

113
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,391
AN AREA THAT HIS REPORT

114
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,226
SHOULD GO BECAUSE IT'S NOT A

115
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:39,893
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION AND

116
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:45,632
CAN YOU ALSO POTENTIALLY

117
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,600
SHUT DOWN THIS DISCUSSION

118
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,367
THAT IS EVERYWHERE IN THE

119
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,635
PRESS AND AMONG DEMOCRATS AS

120
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,470
WELL, TOO.

121
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,838
BECAUSE IT'S BEGINNING TO

122
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,473
IMPEDE ON OTHER PRESIDENTIAL

123
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,707
ABILITIES LIKE

124
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,641
IMPEACHMENT -- I'M SORRY,

125
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,043
LIKE PARDONS.

126
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,178
HE CAME OUT AND PARDONED

127
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,546
SCOOTER LIBBY AND YOU HAVE

128
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,314
ALL THESE DEMOCRATS SAYING

129
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,281
THAT IS OBSTRUCTION.

130
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,316
HE GIVES AN ORDER TO HIS

131
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:02,983
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

132
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,485
THEY SAY IT'S OBSTRUCTION.

133
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,220
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

134
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,254
JUST NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED

135
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,455
ONE WIRT OTHER.

136
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,022
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.

137
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,691
YOU KNOW, FOLKS WHO ARE VERY

138
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,259
KINDER THAT THERE WAS SOME

139
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,560
SERIOUS WRONGDOING HERE ARE

140
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,595
POINTING MOSTLY TO THE

141
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,296
MICHAEL COHEN PART OF THE

142
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:16,730
INVESTIGATION.

143
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,799
THAT THESE RECORDINGS THAT

144
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,501
ARE ON HIS SEVERAL CELL

145
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,769
PHONES THAT HE HAD ARE

146
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,070
LIKELY TO LEAD DOWN SOME

147
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,505
ROAD THEY BELIEVE THAT WILL

148
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,106
ENTRAP THE PRESIDENT IN SOME

149
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:26,507
WRONGDOING.

150
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,441
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT SEEMS

151
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,609
TO BE VERY MUCH IN THE

152
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,843
FOREFRONT IS THIS MEETING AT

153
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:30,444
TRUMP TOWER.

154
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,645
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

155
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,479
WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED ABOUT

156
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,781
THOSE SITUATIONS, HOW DOES

157
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,048
THAT PLAY INTO HOW YOU SEE

158
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,350
THE LARGER PICTURE HERE OR

159
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,819
DOES IT?

160
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,254
>> WELLING, THE MEETING AT

161
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,455
