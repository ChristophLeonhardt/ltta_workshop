IN THE WAKE OF
YESTERDAY'S ELECTION.
AND ONCE AGAIN IT IS
HAPPENING IN MAINE.
LAST NIGHT VOTERS IN MAINE
VOTED ON A BALLOT MEASURE TO
EXPAND MEDICAID TO LOW INCOME
PEOPLE LIVING WITH THAT STATE.
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DO
THESE SORT OF THINGS
BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY COMES
IN, BUT THEY PASSED IT.
AND THE GOVERNOR WILL NOT LET IT
HAPPEN IF HE HAS ANY SAY.
THAT IS A HUGE FINANCIAL
INCENTIVE TO INSTITUTE THE
SORT OF PROGRAM IN YOUR STATE.
IF YOU ARE IDEOLOGICALLY
OPPOSED, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH
APPARENTLY.
PAULA PAGE NOT ONLY VETOED, HE
WILL ALSO ATTEMPT TO STOP
THE BALLOT INITIATIVE.
>>SO RAIDING THE RAINY DAY FUND
ñ IF IT'S NOT TO GIVE
HEALTH CARE TO SICK DYING
PEOPLE WHAT IS IT FOR?
>> MAYBE FOR A
TRI-CENTENNIAL PARTY.
IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF IT WAS
JUST THIS, SO THEY'LL MAKE
SURE HE DOESN'T.
BUT THIS IS COMING OFF
OF JUST YESTERDAY ñ
MAINE LAST YEAR AND THE ELECTION
THEY HAD VOTED TO INSTITUTE
RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN
STATEWIDE ELECTIONS THERE.
HE IS ALSO DELAYING THAT UNTIL
2021 IF AT ALL.
RIGHT NOW THERE IS A PETITION
DRIVE GOING ON IF THEY CAN
RAISE SIGNATURES THAN THEY CAN
HAVE A STATEWIDE VOTE ON A
PEOPLE'S VETO OF THAT BILL.
>> I THINK THERE ARE
TWO KEY LESSONS.
YOUR GOVERNMENT IS NOT
WORKING FOR YOU.
YOUR GOVERNMENT IS JUST NOT
WORKING FOR YOU, A SECOND OF ALL
JIMMY SAID POLITICAL FOOTBALL
WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING.
IN THE CASE OF HEALTHCARE, THAT
IS THE CASE BIG TIME, IT IS
A POLITICAL FOOTBALL.
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.
MEANWHILE IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE
LOWER ON OUR GDP THAN WHAT
WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING.
THAT IS LIKE SAYING WE
ARE SPENDING 300
BUCKS FOR YOUR CAR A MONTH.
I AM NOT A MATHEMATICIAN.
>> IT DOES MAKE SENSE IF YOU
WERE THE GUY SELLING THE
MORE EXPENSIVE SHITTIER CAR.
>>IT
IS KIND OF STUNNING THAT THEY
ARE ABLE TO DO THIS PUBLICLY.
>> HE DIDN'T WAIT, IT WAS
IMMEDIATELY.
>>AND BY THE WAY I DON'T HAVE AN
ALTERNATIVE PLAN TO GIVE
HIM THAT.
IT'S LIKE THERE IS NO
SHAME ANYMORE.
STUFF LIKE THIS, WE JUST
DENY PEOPLE HEALTHCARE.
IT IS JUST THIS DISCONNECT.
>>THIS IS THE DUDE WHO WAS
MAKING THOSE RACIST
COMMENTS ABOUT OUT-OF-STATE
DRUG DEALERS.
HE APPARENTLY ñ NEXT YEAR IS HIS
LAST YEAR, HE IS TERM LIMITED.
TO SOME EXTENT THAT MAY BE
BREATHING WORSE BEHAVIOR
BECAUSE HE FIGURES I AM
LEAVING NEXT YEAR ANYWAY.
>> I HEARD THAT WHEN YOU CALL
HIS OFFICE AN INTERN PICKS
UP AND TELLS YOU GO
FUCK YOURSELF.
>>I CAN IMAGINE THAT.
