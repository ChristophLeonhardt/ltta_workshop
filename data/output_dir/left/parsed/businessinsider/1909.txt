there's a strong shoelace knot and a
weak shoelace nut and most of us have
been taught to tie our shoes using the
weak nut which comes untied more often
here's how to check pull the strands at
the base of the nut if the bow Orient's
itself down the long axis of the shoe
that's the weak form of the nut the
stronger form Orient's itself along the
short axis of the shoe this knot will
come untied less at the time here's how
to tie it you cross the laces and make a
loop you take the other lace and pull
away from you around the loop you go
through the hole and pull both laces
tight you know you did it the correct
way because when you pull the inside of
the shoe like this the knot stays along
the short axis of the shoe
