America ana Alma can leave each female family happy Mouse Bowtique who ability Najibullah Marie is caught between his two home countries Yemen a nation destroyed by war and in the midst of what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis and the United States where Donald Trump's travel ban has now made it seemingly impossible to bring his family I finished I'm Estes Park menu Winnie Morton and he will enjoy we should Najeeb and his family have been living in the East African nation of Djibouti across the sea from Yemen for almost four months there hasn't been an American Embassy in Yemen for over three years now because of the war that means visa applicants including American citizens like Najib have had their cases assigned to foreign countries like Djibouti as they try to get their families away from the council ma fille mal elmeshad the Kulemin back they have Murphy my official in Kenya - Bahamas top in heart l Brandon Hara how do you I had him and Michelle harem Najib's

join him in the US where he works to support them and where she met can get stable medical care they applied well before Donald Trump became president and introduced a travel ban mass outcry and protests marked the initial chaotic rollout of the ban which stopped the entry of nationals from a number of Muslim majority countries including Yemen released just a week after Trump took office the order morphed through three versions while I was being challenged in court so it wasn't until December that the full impact on families became clear when the supreme court allowed the third version of the band to go into effect a month and a half later Najib and his family had their interview at the u.s. embassy here in Djibouti describe what happened in the embassy here in the interview Maya yeah yes it's because she was born after Nagi became a citizen his youngest daughter Lamia could be issued a passport but his wife and two other daughters needed visas I am a faculty mentor my best fear now is not kind and a few thought is he one of the changes in the latest version of the travel ban is the inclusion of one pathway to the u.s. a waiver that can be granted on a case-by-case basis if applicants meet three criteria the Moapa Tunisia Egypt hello posts indeed many cool at least less Oaxaca la la wondered who decry sheer Aletta didn't owe me a lemon alhambra Nutella me here let me Najeeb thought that given Seamus condition and the fact that he's an American citizen they would qualify for a waiver with no appeals process their one hope now is the Supreme Court which is hearing a challenge to the travel ban with a decision to come in the summer until then their lives are in limbo and Mahanama Kalifa living here has cost him his savings and he's relying on family and friends to get by so now he's questioning if they can bear the weight in djibouti or if they'll have to go back to Yemen so now that you've been refused what's your my side Oona oh I know but fearfully I'm a comma house moving to say I do not know and hello hello saba originally manasa an allure janeyah my name can happen on the war in Yemen shows no signs of slowing as northern rebels continue to fight with a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and supported by the United States now in its fourth year the conflict has destroyed much of the country's infrastructure leading to widespread disease and famine and over 22 million people in need of humanitarian assistance it's this that so many Yemenis are trying to escape as they try to reunite with their families in the u.s. instead hundreds have been stranded between their two homes stuck in a foreign country we went to meet with a group of applicants who'd been in Djibouti for months many of whom had already received waiver rejections under the ban who here has a US citizenship so a lot of you so are you you have citizenship I was born and raised there and so you're applying for who my wife I got the refusal paper here so you're gonna do now most of spent tens of thousands of dollars waiting in Djibouti where there's a high cost of living spending fortunes and borrowing fortunes and in the end taxi that's the question facing everyone here as they grapple with how to keep their families United and figure out where their home is now how is this affecting your and your families and then they just tear that apart the moment this day was lifted all of these people received visa denials with a notice that they were also denied the waiver dial SMS is an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights which has been working with Yemeni American visa applicants who have received waiver rejections for their relatives she says there's been little transparency from the administration about how waivers are actually granted so that is one apply for a visa waiver there isn't like a formal application process there isn't a real template available there isn't a forum available you just go with a very thin language that's in the proclamation and you try to argue that you that criteria that you would be subjected to undue hardship if you're denied that it would be in the national interest to let you in and that you don't pose a threat to national security but it's a bit of a shadow boxing exercise because you don't really know what it is you need to show to meet that criteria did anyone here get a waiver many of the families we met didn't even know that there was a waiver in the band largely because they began their application process years ago were you aware of what the waiver process was they're people who had gone through their interview process and filed all the documents well before it was ever such a thing as a waiver so they didn't even make a case for undue hardship so on what basis were they being denied it's like you're getting a rejection for something you didn't even ask for that seems particularly you know Kafka asked that you know your application for waivers been denied and I'm you know you've never even applied for one these are US citizens and US lawful permanent residents who have a right to be reunited with our families one of the couples we met in Djibouti has been trying to start a life in the US for nearly three years yeah sure Thanks for seeing us home Mohammad first moved to New York in his early 20s when he went back to Yemen a few years later he and Aziza got married and they had their daughter omnia the war broke out when she was still a toddler and we don't worry don't worry we don't work a few foreign elements the Corolla hiya mr. Kerem us Phyllis well Phaedra Phaedra become favor uh listen aha vanessa has its sham a big couldn't and you gotta test in a Philippine has the tariff interfere bottom I happiness among a little myself a year ago Frobisher had that house off a playa rattling I had a little Muhammad became a citizen when he went back to the US where he was working and most of his family lives and started planning for Aziza Annamayya to join him sighs thug is not for the house for nature for the house as I planned that's it so we finally ain't gonna do on the phone when they got to Djibouti five-year-old DeMeo was given a visa but her mother was still waiting for a decision they call us for there from the embassy Monday the community come to the embassy tomorrow at feed life to that moment I was like we gonna get the visa because my mother my wife same case same number so they know they give my daughter visa so I don't think so begin giving my wife reject but aziza's interviewed took place before the ban went into effect and it was unclear to her that she had to make a case for a waiver hydrogen envelope on the work across the oaken sitting on the sega cart rambo palpable noise in color well she kind of resin it says a waiver won't be granted in your case sticking to the counter provisions of the proclamation did they give you any other reason that they explained why it was so I let my you know get the passport buddies we just watch the news they even give you information from that the family needs to make a decision about their future within days because Muhammad and their daughter have to go to the US while she still has a visa but then the question is where will Aziza go Philon tanto para las Hatton deadstock repetitive of the track mudfish Abelardo omaha weekend oh sorry Kiera Cameron Petra had an open house event at an event I cherish women in Holly an updated of adobo Shelly I'm mama mama Tovar sent over sent over to reminisce and show you a diamond in the hollows lava the separation facing Mohammedan Aziza is shared by too many families their lives on Klaus as they wait for the Supreme Court to decide some in Djibouti others having returned to Yemen and their relatives in the u.s. waiting hoping they can be together soon before the war Yemeni Americans were able to travel relatively easily between their two home countries that's the case for Abdul Fahim he works in the US for an ATM company to support his family we went to meet him at his apartment just outside New York City home to generations of Yemeni Americans that's a wave of immigrants they came from our area in Yemen Abdus family's roots in us go back almost a century I'm a fourth generation here fourth generation in the country my father's grandfather from his mother's side the citizen my father is a citizen all my uncle's are citizens Abdul had hoped his children would continue that line - that's so far she's 21 years old Mohammed is 17 well I was 9 this is my wife and your other son is how old 19 years old there's nothing this video he first applied for visas for his wife and four children in 2015 just after the war began it marked the beginning of their first long separation which lasted almost three years without me being here supporting them we wouldn't have a source of income to meet our life demands was the logic for me to come but emotionally was that was tougher than any time before the next time you would see them would be in Djibouti when they left Yemen and traveled there for the visa interview with Ontario together and was in January 29th in the interview the little one she was eligible for citizenship she get it easy but the rest of the family was rejected it's difficult to reconcile Optus family's history in America with the fact that his own children are now banned from coming here that wasn't that America that we thought about it that we dream to live in and to come to and like to settle here to pursue our lives the day we met Abdul the rest of his family had just left to Booty it was too expensive to stay there so they went to Jordan where they'll wait for the Supreme Court's decision it's gonna be a life-changing decision after that when you live here you feel lonely but you still have the hope that they gonna come and was just gonna be a normal process for to bring them since it gets that hard and with the ban you feel even lonelier than than before you kids are the other side of the globe and it's very very very hard to know the weight for families is costing them both emotionally and financially as they try to cope with the uncertainty of what their future is via tralala neighborhood but what cinnamon of Bishop I mean hungry after Nana a little Jimmy louder and the Assad el-hawa hey Donna dr.mohammed built Marilla the families we met during our reporting like Najib and his family seemed like they met the criteria for a waiver under the ban one of the things that we're really sort of scratching our heads about it's a sort of undue hardship requirement and how we can show that many of the people as you can imagine leaving countries like Yemen would suffer undue hardship if they're not able to rejoin their families in the US yet there hasn't been any kind of instruction or clarification by the administration as to what standard you would need to show to make that a new hardship requirement the families we met also seemed like they meet the criteria particularly because they're American citizens and in the Jeep's case his daughter she met needs critical medical care both of which are listed as qualifications to be considered for a waiver so who's deciding who gets a waiver the US government official position is that it's a consular officers discretionary decision but if you put yourself in a position of a consular officer and you're sort of told and the rhetoric around at the administration is over sort of an overall ban these people from these countries are essentially undesirable you're gonna have a much harder look to decide whether or not someone should be eligible for a waiver according to State Department data sent to Congress in the month after the ban went into effect 8400 applications from the targeted countries were processed but only two waivers were approved the State Department later told us that 460 waivers were granted in a period of four months but they refused to say out of how many applications by claiming that there is a robust waiver process through which you can seek a waiver it sort of takes away some of the harm it's a bit of more of a sugar coating of what is an outright ban and then that sugar coating disappears if you actually look at what's happening on the ground and we see that the waiver process is only there in name but not in practice the State Department declined our requests to interview officials at the US Embassy in Djibouti or in Washington but while we were in Djibouti we managed to catch then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on a tour of five African nations it was just a few days before Trump would fire him the Yemen war is right next door many Yemeni Americans are unable to bring their children or spouses to the US nearly all of them are being rejected because of the presidential proclamation what would you say to these American citizens that are being separated from their families the president has put policies in place that are designed to ensure that people coming are fully vetted it is somewhat chaotic we've all witnessed the kinds of attacks that have taken place both in Europe we've had attacks in the United States as well the president feels a deep responsibility to do everything he can to prevent those and so processes have been put in place that do slow the processing of people's applications to come to the United States we're going to follow those procedures closely and we hope that people will be patient with us while we work through that Marvel hotter led but Johnny Shima bindle Maha then I'm no Camille and I said to Phoenix back and more tonic water on MDS fellow alumni niche bowser nervous within ten days of living to Booty we'd heard that many of the families we'd met there have left of morphine tell you Susheela we met up with Muhammad and his daughter omnia in Brooklyn where they're now living with the rest of his family they decided that Aziza would go to Jordan where Muhammad's older brother lives while they wait to see what the Supreme Court decides very beefy huh well in telematic about to convey Hannah I literally him Cohen I mean Allah their hope is that um Nia can get her passport or green card soon so she can join her mother in Jordan while Muhammad works in New York but it still means her family will be separated she leave a
