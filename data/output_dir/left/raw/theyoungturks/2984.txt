1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:08,329
TODAY IS TAXABLE DAY AND THE
GOP HAS ALREADY PASSED THE HOUSE

2
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:09,780
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT ABOUT AN

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,959
HOUR AND HALF AGO THEY DECIDED
THEY WERE SEVERAL PROBLEMS

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:15,400
WITH THE BILL.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,199
ITS NAME WAS INACCURATE AS
BERNIE SANDERS POINTED OUT,

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,660
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CHANGE IT.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,560
THERE'S ALSO ISSUES WITH
COMPONENTS OF THE BILL THAT

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,850
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,670
PROCESS THEY ARE USING TO MOVE
THIS THROUGH WITH ONLY 51

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,939
VOTES RATHER THAN 60.

11
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,620
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SMALL
TECHNICAL CHANGES.

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,650
THE BILL WOULD BE REVOTE ON
TOMORROW, BUT IT IS EXPECTED

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,090
TO PASS.

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,710
TONIGHT WE HAVE THE SENATE

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,120
VOTING ON IT THAT IS WHAT
PEOPLE'S

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:53,510
HOPES TO STOP THE BILL REMAIN.

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,480
THE ENTIRE THING IS STILL

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,750
SHROUDED IN ALL THIS
CONTROVERSY, ESPECIALLY THE

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,540
CORKER AMENDMENT FACT THAT MANY
INDIVIDUALS LIKE CORKER AND OF

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,540
COURSE PRES.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,680
TRUMP ARE GOING TO
MAKE A TON OF MONEY BECAUSE THIS

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,810
NEW ADDITION OF THE BILL
SPECIFICALLY AIDS PEOPLE WHO

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,190
HAVE LARGE REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS
BUT VERY FEW EMPLOYEES WHICH IS

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,570
SUPPOSED TO BE THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF HOW TAX INCENTIVES

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,610
WORK, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BENEFIT
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:33,700
>> CAN I JUST SAY HOW PROUD I AM
OF DAVID SIROTA WHO IS A TYT

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,930
CONTRIBUTOR.

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,890
HE WROTE IT FOR THE IB TIMES AND
THEN TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,770
YOUNG TURKS.

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:50,410
HE BROKE THAT STORY.

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,210
AND NOW EVERYONE IS CALLING OUT
REPUBLICANS FOR WHAT IS A CLEAR

32
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,390
GIVEAWAY TO NOT ONLY CORKER BUT
TO TRUMP, CORKER.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,080
IN THE OLD DAYS WITH JUST TV
THEY WOULD'VE EASILY GOTTEN

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,170
AWAY WITH IT BUT WITH THE
INTERNET AND WITH ALL THESE

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,408
GREAT REPORTERS OUT THERE THEY
WERE CAUGHT RED-HANDED.

36
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:13,650
>>WE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR ONE THE
FACT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS IN

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,510
THIS BILL IT THAT REMAINS IS THE

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,150
CARRIED INTEREST TAX LOOPHOLE
WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING

39
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,319
ABOUT FOR SO LONG.

40
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,029
I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT ON
THE SHOW BEFORE.

41
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:30,739
THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT IF YOU
ARE MANAGING INVESTMENT MONEY

42
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,739
YOU GET A CERTAIN FEE BASED ON
THE SIZE OF THE FUND AND YOU

43
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,300
ALSO GET A PERCENTAGE OF THE
PROFITS THAT ARE EARNED ON THAT

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,400
FUND.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,709
THE WAY THE LAW IS RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE TAXED AT A HIGHER

46
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,700
PERCENTAGE ON THE FIRST PART
THAN THE SECOND PART AND THE

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,019
REASON HISTORICALLY THAT THE
CARRIED INTEREST IS TAXED AT A

48
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,180
LOWER RATE IS BECAUSE IT SHOULD
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE WILLING

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,499
TO INVEST MORE OF THEIR
OWN MONEY.

50
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:57,310
BUT THE PEOPLE MANAGING THE
FUNDS, IT IS NOT THEIR MONEY,

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,900
THERE IS NO RISK TO THE CAPITAL

52
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,419
WHATSOEVER SO IT MAKES NO SENSE.

53
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,559
THAT IS WHY IT IS ONE OF THE
ICONIC TAX LOOPHOLES THEY BEEN

54
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:14,169
TALKING ABOUT CLOSING
FOR A LONG TIME.

55
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,972
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE OTHER ELEMENTS
OF THIS BILL WE WANT TO TALK

56
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:19,650
ABOUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU VIDEO
WITH REPRESENTATIVE BRADY, A

57
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,629
REPUBLICAN, WHO WILL ATTEMPT TO
DO SOME MENTAL JUJITSU TO GET

58
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,110
YOU TO MOVE ON FROM THE FACT
THAT THIS UNNECESSARY TAX

59
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,319
LOOPHOLE REMAINS.

60
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,560
>> WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT FOR
THE NEXT HOUR IF YOU WOULD LIKE,

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,999
BUT FOR MOST AMERICANS THEY CAN
CARE LESS ABOUT THAT, THEY CARE

62
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:40,069
ABOUT THEIR PAYCHECKS AND
GETTING THE ECONOMY GOING AND

63
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,549
FRANKLY I HAVE A COLLEGE SON AS
WELL, ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY

64
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,540
HAVE A GOOD PAYING JOB WHEN THEY
ARE DONE WITH SCHOOL.

65
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,949
>>WE CAN HOLD PUT BOTH OF THESE
THOUGHTS IN HER HEAD THE SAME

66
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,260
TIME.

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,359
WHAT ABOUT CARRIED INTEREST HERE
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THIS GOES TO

68
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,989
VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE HERE IN NEW
YORK AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

69
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,370
WHY IS IT STILL IN THE BILL?

70
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,659
>> THREE-YEAR HOLDING PERIOD TO
MAKE SURE THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT

71
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,989
USING AND FLIPPING Ã± MAKING SURE
YOU HAVE CAPITAL AT RISK, THAT

72
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,599
YOU HOLD IT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF
TIME AND THEN HE WORKED TO GROW

73
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,760
IT, ALL THAT IS A REASON BEHIND

74
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,819
IT BUT AGAIN PERFECT EXAMPLE I
THINK OF WHY WASHINGTON AND

75
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,918
NEW YORK GET CAUGHT UP IN ALL
THESE ANCILLARY ISSUES AND

76
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,750
FORGET THE BIG PICTURE HERE.

77
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,800
>> SOME NOTHING IN WHAT SLEEPY
LEX LUTHER EXPLAINS IT.

78
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,629
IT IS STILL NOT YOUR MONEY.

79
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,030
>> LET ME GO INTO MORE DETAIL.

80
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,580
I KIND OF LIKE HIS ANSWER
BECAUSE HE'S BASICALLY SAYING

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,319
LOOK REGULAR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS SO HUSH UP.

82
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:54,020
HE SAYING BASICALLY WHAT DOES A
GIVEAWAY TO OUR DONORS AND WE

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,430
DON'T THINK THE AVERAGE AMERICAN

84
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,400
UNDERSTANDS IT SO WE ARE JUST
GOING TO SNEAK IT IN.

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,389
YOU CAN'T DEFEND IT ALL YOU CAN
SAY AS REGULAR AMERICANS DON'T

86
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,949
KNOW ABOUT IT SO PLEASE BE QUIET
AND THAT IS WHY THEY DON'T

87
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,210
CARE ABOUT IT.

88
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,479
I'M JUST GOING TO FILL IN WHAT
JOHN SAID A LITTLE BIT MORE.

89
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,150
IF I GIVE MY MONEY FOR A HEDGE
FUND TO INVEST AND THEY MAKE ME

90
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,259
20 BUCKS TO THEIR INVESTORS,

91
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,100
NICE JOB.

92
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,520
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO
INCENTIVIZE FOR ME TO INVEST

93
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,319
THEY WILL LET ME PAY A
LOWER TAX ON THE $20.

94
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,080
THE REALITY IS RICH PEOPLE DON'T
NEED AN INCENTIVE TO INVEST,

95
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,100
YOU MAKE MONEY BY INVESTING.

96
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,349
WARREN BUFFETT HAS SAID THIS SO
MANY TIMES, IT IS PREPOSTEROUS

97
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:43,159
TO CLAIM THAT IF YOU DON'T GIVE
TAX INCENTIVES WHICH PEOPLE

98
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,879
WILL JUST SIT ON THEIR
MONEY AND DO NOTHING.

99
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,670
THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS.

100
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,770
THIS IS AN EXTRA LAYER OF
OBSERVANT SURGERY.

101
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:59,599
THE HEDGE FUND WHO DID NOT RISK
ANY MONEY, THEY MADE 20% OF THE

102
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:03,120
PROFIT BECAUSE THAT IS
THEIR JOB TO INVEST.

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,680
AND HOW I AM GOING TO GET
COMPENSATED IS TAKING 20% OF

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,780
WHAT I MADE.

105
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,740
IT INCENTIVIZES THEM, BUT
THAT IS THEIR JOB.

106
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,660
IT IS IN ESSENCE A SALARY FOR
THEM, A WAGE FOR THEM.

107
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,280
THEY ARE NOT RISKING ANY OF
THEIR OWN MONEY AS AN

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,820
INVESTMENT.

109
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,639
IT DOES NOT SPUR ANY INVESTMENT,
ALL IT DOES IS HAVE A TAX BREAK

110
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,159
FOR HEDGE FUND GUYS AND SOME OF
THEM DO A GREAT JOB, SOME A BAD

111
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,379
JOB BUT THEY GET COMPENSATED
RICHLY FOR IT.

112
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,830
THEY DON'T NEED AN EXTRA TAX
BREAK AND ONE THAT HAS NOTHING

113
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,220
TO DO WITH THE STATED PURPOSE OF
CREATING MORE INVESTMENTS.

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:58,229
THAT IS WHY KEVIN BRADY
CANNOT DEFEND IT.

115
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,110
THE HEDGE FUND ONE, REMEMBER
TRUMP PROMISED VERY CLEARLY ON

116
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,780
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BUT HE
WOULD TAKE THIS AWAY.

117
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,159
HE WAS LYING AND NOW THEY ARE
NOT TAKING IT AWAY AND IT IS

118
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:12,139
STRICTLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THEIR DONORS.

119
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,389
>>I ONLY MENTION THIS BECAUSE IN
THE END OF THE LAST HOUR YOU

120
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,539
PLAYED A PREDICTION.

121
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:22,060
I WILL MAKE A PREDICTION.

122
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,840
AFTER A DEBATE WHEN HE SAID HE
WOULD GET RID OF THAT AND HE WAS

123
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,449
GETTING ALL THIS CREDIT AS BEING
DIFFERENT AS OTHER REPUBLICANS

124
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,759
ON TAXES I SAID IT WOULD NOT

125
00:07:30,759 --> 00:00:00,000
HAPPEN, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO
