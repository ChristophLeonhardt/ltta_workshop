COLORADO SPRINGS WERE SOME OF

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,000
THE RICHEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,450
COME TOGETHER TO EXPLAIN ABOUT
COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW HARD THEY

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,809
HAVE IT.

6
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:25,199
WE WILL 

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,560
BREAK THAT
DOWN.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,800
ADMISSION FOR THIS WAS A

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
PROMISE TO GIVE AT LEAST

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:40,110
$100,000 ñ SO FAR I DON'T KNOW
THAT THEIR NAMES HAVE BEEN MADE

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,700
PUBLIC.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,800
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:01:02,240
THE CONCERNS HERE.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,540
WE ARE ALMOST
ALWAYS HAVING ELECTIONS HERE.

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,110
HAVE A FEW DAYS WHERE WE ARE

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,110
NOT.

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,910
THEY WANT TO GET THEIR
POLICY OBJECTIVES DONE AT THAT

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,080
POINT.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
THEY HAVE SPECIFICALLY

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,780
CITED REPEALING OBAMA CARE AND
MAJOR TAX REFORM WHICH IS BARELY

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,960
CODE FOR GIVE US OUR TAX BREAK.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,510
SO MAINLY THERE IS ONE GOAL,

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:33,110
GIVE US OUR TAX BREAK.

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,060
LET ME JUST GIVE YOU EXTRA
CONTEXT HERE.

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,050
FIRST OF ALL, I

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,200
DEBATED AT OXFORD WITH THE
PERSON WHO WON THE CITIZENS

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,890
UNITED CASE.

28
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,750
HE MADE THE CASE
THAT THIS IS PROGRESSIVES THAT

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,680
DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE MONEY ñ
HE SAYS THEY ARE TRYING TO DENY

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,590
YOU A VOICE, THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN.

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,590
YOU HAD TO PAY AT

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,130
LEAST $100,000 TO GET IN THE

33
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,130
DOOR OF THIS MEETING.

34
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,420
YOU HAVE TO PLEDGE TO GET IT.

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,380
AND PRETTY SURE THEY TAKE
NOTES ON WHO DELIVERED ON THAT

36
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,929
PLEDGE.

37
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,080
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
TO EVEN BEGIN TO AFFECT THESE

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,290
POLICIES, YOU WOULD THINK THEY
AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TO NOT

39
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:27,870
ADMIT THEY ARE THERE.

40
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,359
THESE ARE
LEGALIZED BRIBES NOW, THEY MAKE

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:36,430
THE SYSTEM INHERENTLY CORRUPT.

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,430
IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,549
CORRUPTION OF BIG GOVERNMENT,

44
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,569
WHO DO YOU THINK CORRUPTED THEM?

45
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,569
THESE GUYS.

46
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:42,569
NOT ILLEGAL

47
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,370
IMMIGRANTS.

48
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,290
AMERICANS FOR
PROSPERITY IS A KOCH BROTHERS

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,290
GROUP.

50
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:58,220
IT IS FUNDED BY THEM WHO
HAVE ABOUT $80 BILLION BETWEEN

51
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,220
THEM.

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,499
SO ANY TAX BREAK
FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTS THEM.

53
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:04,499
THIS

54
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,499
GROUP OVERALL, IT AFFECTS

55
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,760
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR.

56
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,309
SO
THE KOCH BROTHERS IN TOTAL PLAN

57
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:19,849
TO SPEND THREE TO $4 MILLION TO
BEGIN THIS ELECTION.

58
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:20,849
AND YOU

59
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,559
THINK THEY ARE BRIBING PEOPLE OR
JUST SPEAKING TO PEOPLE TO THE

60
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,049
TUNE OF THREE TO $4 MILLION.

61
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,290
BUT
THERE ARE MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR

62
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,890
RAMIFICATIONS HERE.

63
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,430
AND WHY
HEALTH CARE REFORM AND TAX

64
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,430
REFORM?

65
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,079
BECAUSE HEALTH CARE
REFORM HAS SIX TO $800 BILLION

66
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,480
OF TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH, AND
TAX REFORM IS NOTHING BUT TAX

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:55,480
CUTS FOR THE RICH.

68
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
NOW THEY ARE
GETTING EVEN MORE BREAKS.

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,739
300 TO 400 MILLION, THAT IS A
SIGNIFICANT ñ JUST THEM TO COULD

70
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,379
FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF
ALL THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE RACES

71
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,709
IN THIS CYCLE.

72
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,719
ALSO IF YOU HAVE
300, $400 MILLION TO SPEND ON

73
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,489
ELECTIONS, YOU NEED TO BE
FIGHTING FOR MORE TAX BREAKS,

74
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,259
YOU CAN SPEND YOUR MONEY.

75
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,250
JUST GO ON A YACHT MAN.

76
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,379
YOU ARE THINKING TOO SMALL,
BUILD A PRIVATE SPACESHIP AND

77
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:29,130
TOUR VENUS.

78
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,320
STOP BRIBING OUR POLITICIANS
AND GO ENJOY LIFE IF YOU HAVE 80

79
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
BILLION.

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,400
IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE
MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE COMING.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,639
THINK THE BROTHERS ARE ALSO
THINKING WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG

83
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,970
THIS TRUMP GUY IS GOING TO LAST,
AND WHILE HE IS STILL POPULAR,

84
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,560
IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE TAX FRONT

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,699
HE WILL GIVE US ANYTHING WE
WANT.

86
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,770
TAKE IT NOW.

87
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:02,370
HERE ARE SOME OF THOSE QUOTES.

88
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,669
THAT QUOTE BY ITSELF SHOULD LEAD

89
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:36,930
TO COMPREHENSIVE REFORM.

90
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,280
THAT IS YOUR PROOF OF
CORRUPTION RIGHT THERE.

91
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,000
HE MADE YOUR WHOLE CASE.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,440
THEY USED TO TALK ABOUT THE
PIGS IN THE TROUGH, POLITICIANS

93
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
WHO

94
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,199
WERE SO CORRUPT.

95
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,650
HERE ONE OF THE
GUYS WHO CORRUPTED THEM SAYS

96
00:05:51,650 --> 00:06:03,960
YEAH, I HAVE 

97
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,789
A PIGGY BANK.

98
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:10,409
IN
THIS CASE IT IS TOTALLY

99
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,349
REPUBLICANS, AND THEY ARE GOING
OVER THE TOP ON THE TAX CUTS.

100
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:23,460
BUT CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN ñ AND
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND THE

101
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,770

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:34,949
HE IS SAYING IT.

105
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:38,661
THE GUY WHO CORRUPTED HIM IS
BRAGGING ABOUT IT. AND YES, ONE

BANKS AND RURAL VIRGINIA?
