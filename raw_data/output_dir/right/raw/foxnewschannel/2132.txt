PROSECUTION.

13
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:41,817
IT WAS THEN THAT FBI DIRECTOR

BOB MUELLER, WHO IN 2008

15
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:47,055

AND RUTHLESS PREDAWN RAID OF THE

17
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,058

IT'S GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,475

00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:15,050
BRIBERY AND EXTORTION I BELIEVE.

30
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,485
I THINK WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THAT

31
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:20,255
THEY THINK, HE MUST HAVE TAKEN A

32
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:21,723
BRIBERY, OR PROMISE TO DO

33
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,258
SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE GIVING HIM

34
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:24,560

THEY ARE USING THEIR OFFICES FOR

MULLER NEEDS TO FURTHER HIS

61
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,617
CAREER, HE IS THE FBI DIRECTOR.

62
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:23,085
HE'S ESTEEMED BY REPUBLICANS AND

63
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:25,153
DEMOCRATS.

64
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:28,857
HOWEVER, AND YOU COULD GET IN ON

65
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,125
THIS, HE DID AUTHORIZE A RAID

66
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:36,498
THAT WAS REMINISCENT OF MANNA PU

67
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:36,732
THAT WAS REMINISCENT OF MANNA PL

68
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,434
MANNA FORT AND COHEN.

69
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,503
IT WAS A PREDAWN RAID, THEY GO

70
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:42,471
IN AND TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF

71
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,072
THE APARTMENT.

72
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:46,675
AND IT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS.

73
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:47,909
>> IT COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND

74
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:48,477
A WHITE COLOR CASE.

75
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:50,345
THEY COULD HAVE CALLED THE

76
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,648
LAWYER AND HE WOULD HAVE COME

77
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:53,282
DOWN AND SURRENDERED.

78
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:56,485
TO DO THAT TO HIS TWO YOUNG

79
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:57,753
CHILDREN WAS DISGRACEFUL.

80
00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:59,688
>> WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

81
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:00,589

00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:09,464
PATRICK FITZGERALD?

85
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:12,067
IT GOES BACK INTO THE 80s, AND

86
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,103
HE WENT BACK TO SCOOTER LIBBY.

87
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:16,905
OUTRAGEOUS PROSECUTION, AND HE

88
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,273
WENT AFTER CONRAD BLACK.

89
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:20,075
THE COURT PART OF THAT

90
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,476
CONVICTION OVERTURNED BY THE

91
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:22,077
SUPREME COURT.

92
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,312
AND OF COURSE NOT ONCE BUT TWO

93
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:27,149
TIMES, THEY TRIED BLAGOJEVICH.

94
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,583
THE COURT SADLY DIDN'T TAKE THE

95
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,285
CASE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND

96
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:32,587
THEY COULD HAVE CLEARED UP THIS

97
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,423
RIDICULOUS FEDERAL BRIBERY

98
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:38,660
STATUTE WHICH IS EXTREMELY

99
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,861
CONFUSING, WIDE ENOUGH TO DRIVE

100
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:40,629
A TRUCK THROUGH.

101
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,765
AND YET HE IS PRAISED FOR

102
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,168
BEING -- IS THE MOST ESTEEMED

103
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,936
PERSON.

104
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,072
HE DID THE ENRON INVESTIGATION

105
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:51,073
AND THE ENRON CASE.

106
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:53,408
BUT THERE WERE PROBLEMS THERE,

107
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,242
TOO.

108
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,244
ARTHUR ANDERSON ENDS UP GETTING

109
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,446
EXONERATION

110
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,081
EXONERATED, MEANWHILE THEY LAID

111
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,350
OFF 85,000 PEOPLE IN THE INTERIM

112
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,017
OFF 85,000 PEOPLE IN THE INTERI

113
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:04,686
INTERIM.

114
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:05,420
IN SOME CASES, THEY ARE

115
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,257
PROTECTING THEM BUT THEY HAVE

116
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,726
UNCHECKED POWER OFTEN TIMES AND

117
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:11,893
IT CAN BE OUT OF CONTROL.

118
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:14,696
AND I'M SORRY, BUT AS I SPEAK OF

119
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,865
THE FORMER CRIMINAL DEFENSE

120
00:04:16,865 --> 00:00:00,000
ATTORNEY, I DON'T WANT TO BE ON
