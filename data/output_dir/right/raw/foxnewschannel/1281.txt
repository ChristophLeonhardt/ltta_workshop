1
00:00:00,607 --> 00:00:02,542
PARTY TO COMPLETELY DESTROY

2
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:02,876
ITSELF.

3
00:00:02,876 --> 00:00:03,910
NO ONE EVER SAYS THAT BUT IT

4
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,578
MAY BE THE BIGGEST CHANGE HE

5
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:07,714
HAS BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY.

6
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:09,015
IT'S FASCINATING.

7
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,183
RADIO SHOW TAMMY BRUCE JOINS

8
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:10,984
US TONIGHT.

9
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:12,419
SHE HAS BEEN WATCHING

10
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:12,786
CAREFULLY.

11
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:14,320
>> UNFORTUNATELY.

12
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,021
>> Tucker: IT'S INTERESTING.

13
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:15,688
IF YOU ARE MAKING THE CASE

14
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:16,923
THAT TRUMP IS KIND OF OUT

15
00:00:16,923 --> 00:00:18,324
THERE AND SAYS THINGS THAT

16
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:20,193
ARE ILL CONSIDERED AND IS HE

17
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:20,527
PROFANE.

18
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:21,995
THAT'S ALL KIND OF TRUE.

19
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:22,996
WOULDN'T YOUR RESPONSE BE

20
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:24,864
I'M THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

21
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:25,899
INSTEAD, THEY ARE OUT

22
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,169
TRUMPING TRUMP BY LIKE XXX

23
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,270
AND THEY HAVE GONE SO CRAZY

24
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,371
THEY MAY NOT WIN THE HOUSE

25
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:31,671
BACK.

26
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,505
WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT?

27
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:34,541
>> LOOK, THESE WOMEN ARE

28
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,942
MAKING TRUMP AT THIS POINT

29
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:37,343
LOOK LIKE SIR GAL HAD WHEN

30
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:38,812
IT COMES TO HIS BEHAVIOR.

31
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:40,146
HIS THIRD AND FOURTH TERMS

32
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:41,214
AT THIS POINT HAVE BEEN

33
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:42,615
PRETTY MUCH SECURED AFTER

34
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:44,651
THESE DISPLAYS.

35
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:45,251
>> Tucker: TOTALLY TRUE.

36
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,586
>> THIS IS -- IT'S IN THE

37
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:46,853
NEW.

38
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:48,588
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS BECAUSE

39
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,423
OF THEIR RAGE, THAT THE

40
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:51,224
CURTAIN HAS BEEN PULLED

41
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:51,524
BACK.

42
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,759
THEY JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT

43
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,626
HIDING THE NATURE OF WHO

44
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:54,494
THEY ARE.

45
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:56,362
YOU DIDN'T MENTION SALLY

46
00:00:56,362 --> 00:00:56,696
FIELDS.

47
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:57,797
SALLY FIELDS THE ACTRESS,

48
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:00,066
THE FLYING NUN, ALSO

49
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,568
DEFENDED THE USE OF THE

50
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:02,235
C-WORD AND AT THE SAME TIME

51
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:03,570
WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS WHAT

52
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,605
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS

53
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:07,507
NORMALIZE THE DEBASEMENT OF

54
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:08,441
WOMEN IN THE NAME OF BEING

55
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,976
ABLE TO ATTACK A WOMAN WITH

56
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:10,777
WHOM THEY DISAGREE BECAUSE

57
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,145
THEY THINK SHE IS

58
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:13,680
CONSERVATIVE BUT, OF COURSE,

59
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,015
THE IRONY IS IVANKA IS NOT A

60
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:16,449
CONSERVATIVE.

61
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,017
IT IS A MELTDOWN BUT IT IS A

62
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:19,652
REVEAL, ALSO, I THINK, WHY

63
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:21,221
SOMEONE LIKE WEINSTEIN COULD

64
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:23,123
SURVIVE SO LONG IN THAT

65
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:23,490
WORLD.

66
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,124
>> Tucker: THAT'S RIGHT.

67
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:25,091
>> WHEN YOU ARE WILLING TO

68
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,192
REDUCE AND HAVE NO

69
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:27,494
PRINCIPLES WHEN YOU REFUSE

70
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,095
TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S

71
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,730
RIGHT, BECAUSE SOMEONE IS A

72
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,498
POLITICAL OPPONENT.

73
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:32,799
THAT ANYTHING GOES.

74
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,933
SO, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

75
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,335
SEEING WHAT THIS MEANS.

76
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,137
THEY ARE SEEING THAT THIS IS

77
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:38,338
CERTAINLY NOT A FRAMEWORK

78
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,640
NOT ONLY OF THEIR VALUES,

79
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,941
BUT OF A KIND OF AN

80
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,308
UGLINESS.

81
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:43,476
NOW, AT THE SAME TIME, LOOK,

82
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:45,278
PEOPLE IN MEDIA MAKE

83
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:45,645
MISTAKES.

84
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,579
ON THE FLY.

85
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,381
THAT WE KNOW THIS.

86
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,949
YOU GENUINELY CAN REGRET

87
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,084
SOMETHING AND APOLOGIZE.

88
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,186
THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT

89
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:55,221
SAMANTHA BEE DYNAMIC

90
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:56,322
REPRESENTS WHICH IS

91
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:57,423
DIFFERENT FROM ROSEANNE BARR

92
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:59,325
WHO IS DOING A TWEET, IT WAS

93
00:01:59,325 --> 00:01:59,692
SCRIPTED.

94
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,694
IT WAS CLEARLY EDITED WITH

95
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:02,962
AN EDITING TEAM.

96
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:04,330
THEN IT WAS TAPED.

97
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,365
THEN IT AIRED.

98
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:06,833
THEN IT WAS PUT ON SOCIAL

99
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,068
MEDIA AND IT WAS PROMOTED

100
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:16,342
AND WHEN THOSE VILE

101
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:17,277
MISOGYNISTIC WORDS HER

102
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:19,512
PRODUCER WAS EXCITED.

103
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:20,180
>> Tucker: SHE WORKS FOR THE

104
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,781
SAME NETWORK THAT OWNS CNN.

105
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,683
I HAVE WORKED IN NEWSROOMS

106
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:24,751
MY WHOLE LIFE.

107
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,653
I USE VULGARITY, I ENJOY IT

108
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:27,987
I DON'T WANT TO BE A BLUE

109
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:29,422
NOSE ABOUT IT THAT ONE WORD

110
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:30,590
THAT SHE USED I DON'T KNOW

111
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,891
ANY MAN WHO USES THAT WORD

112
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,159
BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE WORD

113
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,460
THAT IS ACTUALLY DEGRADING.

114
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,628
IT'S THE THING THAT

115
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:36,896
FEMINISTS ALWAYS TELLING US.

116
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,264
THAT WORD REALLY IS.

117
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:39,666
WHY THAT WORD?

118
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,201
>> IT IS FASCINATING.

119
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:44,070
IT REDUCES US TO A VILE

120
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,038
TERMINOLOGY, TO A PART OF

121
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:46,139
OUR BODY.

122
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,474
AND TO THE ULTIMATE

123
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:49,776
DEBASEMENT OF WHO WE ARE AS

124
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:50,076
WOMEN.

125
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:51,644
THIS HAS TRANSCENDS POLITICS

126
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:53,279
AND PARTY AND EVERYTHING

127
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:53,580
ELSE.

128
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,718
THIS IS ABOUT LOATHING AND

129
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:00,053
HATE THEY HAVE NO IDEAS.

130
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:01,221
THEY SEE THE PRESIDENT IS

131
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:01,621
SUCCESSFUL.

132
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:02,488
WE SHOULD ALL BE HAPPY THAT

133
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:03,590
HE IS BECAUSE THE NATURE OF

134
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,124
WHAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO

135
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:05,592
ACCOMPLISH.

136
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:06,926
AND, YET, BECAUSE THEY DON'T

137
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,695
KNOW HOW TO COUNTER IT, IT

138
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,763
RETURNS INTO THIS, YOU KNOW,

139
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:11,965
ULTIMATELY, IT'S THE FRAUD

140
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:13,933
OF PEOPLE LIKE SNEIDERMAN OR

141
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,602
WEINSTEIN, THE NATURE OF

142
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,737
THIS KIND OF ATTACK, THE

143
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,105
MISOGYNY WAS MY FIRST BOOK

144
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:22,475
IN 2000 1, MISOGYNY AND

145
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:23,943
SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, RACISM

146
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:24,844
LIVES ON THE LEFT.

147
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,079
AGAIN, IT'S NOT ABOUT IF YOU

148
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,113
DON'T LIKE SOMETHING SOMEONE

149
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,715
HAS SAID, WE CAN ALL DEAL

150
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:29,816
WITH THAT.

151
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:30,316
>> Tucker: RIGHT.

152
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:31,417
>> WE HAVE ALL MADE

153
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:31,784
MISTAKES.

154
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,320
THIS IS A CONCERTED,

155
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,221
SCRIPTED ATTITUDE AND THEN

156
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:38,658
FOR OTHER WOMEN TO SUPPORT

157
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:40,627
IT AND TRY TO NORMALIZE IT

158
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:41,861
SALLY FIELDS WAS WELL LIKED

159
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,796
TO SOME DEGREE TO TRY TO

160
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:45,932
NORMALIZE THIS DEBASEMENT

161
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:47,133
MEANS THEY, AT LEAST, HAVE

162
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,768
GONE OFF THE RAILS.

163
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:50,203
>> I GET THAT PEOPLE HAVE,

164
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:51,504
YOU KNOW, DISAGREEMENTS WITH

165
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:51,804
TRUMP.

166
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,039
BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE SCARY.

167
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,007
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK THEY

168
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:55,408
SHOULD BE ANYWHERE NEAR

169
00:03:55,408 --> 00:03:55,708
POWER.

170
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,410
THEY ARE STARTING TO REALLY

171
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,977
SCARE ME.

172
00:03:57,977 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT I
