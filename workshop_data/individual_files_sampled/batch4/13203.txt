a bunch of illegal aliens descended on Chuck Schumer's home last night chanting if Chuck won't let us dream we won't let him sleep here it is so first thing no one's stopping you from dreaming this is the trouble with euphemisms right you know but also those people look like they're 30 I thought the dreamers were these cute little six-year-olds who didn't do anything wrong and they're really nice those are just adults those are adults who haven't figured out their own legal status and their own immigration situation Jacob why don't we just round these people up and deport them they're clearly in violation of the law they're boasting about being in violation of the law they're rubbing our faces in it look to keeping chuck schumer up at night is almost enough for me to offer them full amnesty then on a larger point it's so disrespectful of american law of the american government of a country that has been so good to these people given them free education handouts health care what why don't we just round up all of the rabble-rousing ones and send them back to whatever godforsaken country they fled from in the first place this is the question of the hour and I think that you know the fact that they protested Chuck Schumer who's been probably their biggest advocate in the Senate maybe with a couple of exceptions but he wasn't even home that night so obviously that group protesting at his house weren't the best and brightest of dreamers but I think that so I think that we should look at it in stages just to round everyone up they'll just come right back I think first off we got to get the border secured and then we can say okay is this person worth giving a citizenship is it as a citizenship test or is this person a criminal deviant that we should send back either way it's going to be a struggle as far as policy goes especially as as long as the media keep giving them headlines you know these children that's right the 30 or 40 year old children and on that best and brightest point the data that we have what the mainstream eating would have you believe is it's all six year olds with seven degrees from MIT we're really grateful and love their country and they're just the most all-around apple pie people in the world but the data we have is that 25 percent of them are illiterate half of them don't speak English in the demonstrations like these we see deep ingratitude and entitlement from a country that's been very good to them Benji if Schumer won't give Trump the wall and an end to chain migration will we just let daca expire and start shipping these people home who is gonna blink first well I think I'll answer that question a different way I think that conservatives need to embrace the dreamers who are here and doing good things now there are people who are here doing bad things but that can be said about any any population the fact of the matter is is that a lot of these dreamers had no control over whether or not they got here and they're just trying to live their lives in peace and I and I don't think that protesting group kind of showcases what the entire population is like so that being said there is a population like the people who are protesting Chuck Schumer which I think that you made a really interesting point talking about how Chuck Schumer is kind of the biggest advocate of these folks and you know when when black lives matter or the dreamers protests basically everyone an alienate everyone that's not gonna get anything beneficial done and it's fairly frustrating and it makes their case look a lot weaker and I think that that's unfortunate because there are a lot of good dreamers here who didn't have a choice to come here and should you know should be given the opportunity to succeed and be successful and it's not their fault that they're here so I think that conservatives need to differentiate and this is something that Republican congressman the congresswoman said the other day was that you have to differentiate between the dreamers who could be very good people who had no intention of coming here whatsoever and are just trying to live their lives and the illegal aliens who are crossing the border I think if there's an important distinction there and it's you shouldn't want them in not though I worry that it's a distinction without a difference because they use this term they use the most loaded term imaginable dreamer what on earth does that what does dreaming have to do with the essence of this issue which is illegal aliens resident illegal people what what does that have to do this they seem to be ossified in time as Victor Davis Hanson wrote eloquently a couple days ago so we're talking about a group of people from only this period to this period who were brought over below the age of eighteen now some of these people are almost 40 years old as I had mentioned earlier half of them don't speak English a quarter of them are illiterate Oh does the category of the dreamer as the Democrats called I will not use that terminology because it's such a deceptive insidious euphemism but of these this category of people the daka people the Democrats admitted this in a memorandum two weeks ago that they're relying on these people for their electoral strategy because they know that if they're granted amnesty they will trend overwhelmingly to vote for Democrats so should Republicans embrace a group of people who don't share a lot of as a category don't hold together very coherent lis and who you know don't appear to have any advantages over other immigrant groups or other immigrant groups from Latin America who have come here illegally and who are gonna legalize a million new Democrat voters I just don't see what the advantages for the Republican Party to say yes we need to grant amnesty to them even the vast majority of the country doesn't want to give them amnesty and 56 percent of Democrats don't even want to give them amnesty I think this is a total a total game being played by Democrats they're trying to fool us and I wouldn't do it at all I'm more than happy to keep people in the country who are who will benefit the country and who really are little children I really don't have any means to support themselves but some 40 year old who's out there screaming at Chuck Schumer because we haven't given him enough absolutely not send those people back especially and this is the most important thing if they're going to vote for Democrats if the so called if the Dok of people will agree to vote for Republicans for 25 consecutive elections give them blanket amnesty I'm all-in I think we've reached a grand compromise I may though I think the Republicans just just speaking as a conservative have really dropped the ball on outreach to latina families because they have this fake perception by the fake news media that oh the Republican Party is the party of old white men but that's not true anymore but Republicans have been very bad at sending out that messaging because really if you talk to Latin American families they have a lot of values like they are pro-life they are pro marriage they they are hardworking people who have good worth work ethics and they would and they can and will benefit society so I think that if the dreamers are daca or daca recipients as you call them if they were to change and switch sides and say hey we're not going to vote for Democrats we're gonna vote for Republicans and we're going to show you how we can be a benefit to American society I think that I think that they could see a turnaround as far as as far as that goes but I think that Republicans need to be better at messaging to that particular community sure they work hard and go to church so hopefully it won't be hard to get them to agree to vote for Republicans for 25 consecutive elections Benji did you have a final point on this yeah first of all I don't know if it's even a political issue and I don't really care if they vote Democrat or Republican to me it's a human issue to me it's not political at all all it takes is the affairs of men politics as Aristotle defines it it's how men interact with one another in cities to me I care more about these people's lives than I care about who they vote for but I think it's up to Republicans to reach these people through our ideologies that can click with their personalities and I think that that's incredibly key and I think it's an important point that was just made that Republicans need to do a better job of reaching out to these folks and not making the differentiation between dreamers and illegal aliens and also lumping all the people who you know all the dreamers into the category of the protesters outside Chuck Schumer's house I also just don't think that that's fair so I think that there's a few key distinctions to be made there sure they're all illegal aliens that that is that there's no distinction between a dreamer and an illegal Elian but you're right some of the illegal aliens are wonderful people who are patriotic and like America and work hard and go to church and we should keep those people especially if they vote Republican and some people are awful in their gangsters and they commit crime and they're a net drag on the population and they won't assimilate and they won't learn to read English and they won't learn to speak English and to lump those people in with the good patriotic people who came here through no choice of their own and who have who love their country and are dedicated to it that we shouldn't lump those two people together I absolutely agree
