1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,300
well if me I would try to cool it on
some of this heated rhetoric I really

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,599
like what secretary mattis did about I
don't know half a dozen missile tests

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,800
ago when he simply said we note that
North Koreans have launched a missile

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,060
and we have no further comment that
would drive the North Koreans crazy

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,939
because the you know this place -
they're craving for attention for face

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,279
and so Kim Yuna's has got to be eating
this up when the president United States

7
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,140
is engaging directly with him and in the
manner in which he's he's doing it and

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,719
of course they use this for again for
domestic consumption in North Korea and

9
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,079
at a point I'd make in terms of these
threats about our readiness to you know

10
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,930
in convey conduct military hostile
military action well I think one thing I

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,039
hope they're thinking about what about
the military dependents the families of

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,510
our military people and the civilians
that who are there and in State

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,770
Department Department of Defense not to
mention the thousands of Americans who

14
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,170
live in the Republic of Korea not to
mention the tens of thousands of dual

15
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,509
citizens so if we're going to if we're
serious about initiating hostile

16
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,920
military action North Korea I certainly
hope there's some thought given to the

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:00:00,000
fate of these people
