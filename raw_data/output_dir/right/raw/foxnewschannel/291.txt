1
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:03,855
#MeToo MOVEMENT.

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:05,657
AND HILLARY AND THE DEMOCRATIC

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:06,091
HATERS.

4
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,860
THAT'S THE FOCUS ON TONIGHT'S

5
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,295
AND GOLD.

6
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:11,029
TODAY'S JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,997
HEARD HIS FIRST ORAL ARGUMENTS

8
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:13,632
AT THE SUPREME COURT AND WAS

9
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,667
WELCOMED WARMLY BY HIS

10
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:16,068
COLLEAGUES.

11
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:21,006
IN TONIGHT'S MOMENTS OF

12
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,575
COLLEGIALITY WITH YESTERDAYS

13
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:26,478
CHAOS AND PROMISE FOR MORE.

14
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,679
REPUBLICANS ARE EXUDING MORE

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,380
CONFIDENCE WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE

16
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,215
BANKING ON MORE CHAOS.

17
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:32,251
DESPITE THE BRIGHTEST

18
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:35,087
CATASTROPHIC LOSS OF

19
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:36,855
THE SWING VOTE ON THE HIGH

20
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:37,522
COURT, THEY ARE HITTING THE

21
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:39,124
ENTER KEY ACCELERATOR.

22
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,661
THESE PEOPLE TRULY BELIEVE THEY

23
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:44,830
CAN PROTEST THEIR WAY BACK INTO

24
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:45,530
POWER.

25
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:46,298
SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT WARNED

26
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,600
OF TONIGHT.

27
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:54,239
>> THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME TOO

28
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,073
EXTREME.

29
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:57,042
AND THEY'VE BECOME FRANKLY TOO

30
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:57,609
DANGEROUS TO GOVERN.

31
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,646
THEY HAVE GONE WHACKO.

32
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:03,715
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL, THEY

33
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,250
WILL TRY TO REVERSE OUR AMAZING

34
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,421
PROGRESS AND PLUNGE OUR COUNTRY

35
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:11,256
INTO GRIDLOCK, FRANKLY INTO

36
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,859
POVERTY, ULTIMATELY INTO CHAOS.

37
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,626
>> Laura: THE CHAOS TRAIN HAS

38
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:17,295
NOW EVEN INFECTED WHAT WAS ONCE

39
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:21,166
THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT.

40
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,268
WHY HASN'T DIANNE FEINSTEIN, WHO

41
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,170
WAS CONSIDERED A SOBER MINDED

42
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:29,474
LIBERAL, WHY HASN'T SHE

43
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:30,475
CONDEMNED THE TACTICS AND

44
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:31,877
INTIMIDATION USED BY HER FEMALE

45
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:32,611
COLLEAGUES IN THE HALLS OF THE

46
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:34,246
U.S. SENATE?

47
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:36,014
DO YOU KNOW LIKE?

48
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:37,983
BECAUSE PRO-WOMAN DIANNE

49
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:40,185
FEINSTEIN WANTS TO KEEP THE

50
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:41,686
ATMOSPHERE RED-HOT, SCARILY SO

51
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:44,689
TO DRIVE DEMOCRATIC VOTER

52
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,290
TURNOUT.

53
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,925
BUT JUST WHEN YOU THINK THEY

54
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:47,459
COULDN'T GO LOWER?

55
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,029
THEY DO.

56
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,931
>> TRUMP HAS DELIVERED FOR THESE

57
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,666
PEOPLE ON THE THINGS THEY CARE

58
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,667
ABOUT MOST.

59
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:57,235
HE HAS DELIVERED RACISM FOR

60
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:57,902
THESE PEOPLE.

61
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,738
HE HAS DELIVERED MY SAW THE NEED

62
00:01:59,739 --> 00:01:59,772
FOR

63
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:00,639
THESE PEOPLE.

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,674
HE HAS DELIVERED THE

65
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,375
SUPREME COURT FOR THESE PEOPLE

66
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,877
WHICH IS SOMETHING THEY

67
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,045
CONSIDERED FOR A GENERATION.

68
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:08,813
THEY HAVE CONTROL OF ALL THREE

69
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:09,414
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.

70
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:12,283
WE WILL SEE THIS EITHER FOR 30

71
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:14,519
DAYS, OR TWO DAYS, OR A THOUSAND

72
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,854
YEAR REICH.

73
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:20,058
>> Laura: REICH?

74
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:20,358
NICE.

75
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:23,328
IF YOU AREN'T ON FOR THE MORAL

76
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,796
DICTATES OF LIBERALISM, THE LEFT

77
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,497
WILL DEMONIZE YOU AS A NAZI,

78
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:28,866
PLANT FALSE STORIES AGAINST YOU,

79
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,268
TRY TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE.

80
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,169
OF COURSE, THEY'LL TRY TO GET

81
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,072
YOU FIRED.

82
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:35,373
WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP OR

83
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,475
JUST A KAVANAUGH -- I LOVE

84
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:37,875
SAYING THAT.

85
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,178
IF THEY CAN'T BEAT YOU, THEY'LL

86
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,481
THREATEN TO IMPEACH YOU.

87
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,749
HERE'S THE ORIGINAL FOUNDING

88
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,318
MEMBER OF THE CLINTON WARM

89
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:49,053
WAR ROOM

90
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:51,656
JAMES CARVILLE.

91
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:54,258
>> THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.

92
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,260
THEY AREN'T GOING TO STOP DOING

93
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,495
STORIES ON KAVANAUGH.

94
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:58,863
THE DEMOCRATS WIN BACK THE

95
00:02:58,864 --> 00:02:59,564
HOUSE, THEY'LL PROBABLY HOLD

96
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:02,066
SOME KIND OF HEARINGS ON THE

97
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:02,800
FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

98
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,736
HE PERJURED HIMSELF DURING HIS

99
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:06,904
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS TO THE

100
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:09,674
COURT OF APPEALS.

101
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,075
>> Laura: DEAD OR ALIVE?

102
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:12,877
I LIKE HIM BETTER, BY THE WAY,

103
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:13,711
WHEN HE PUT THE GARBAGE PAIL

104
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:17,448
OVER HIS HEAD BACK IN 2002.

105
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:18,649
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE

106
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,918
LOSS IN 2002?

107
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,423
THAT WAS CARVILLE'S BEST

108
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:28,025
MOVEMENT          MOMENT.

109
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:28,759
HOW IS ANY OF THIS GOING TO MAKE

110
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,961
AMERICA'S LIVES BETTER?

111
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:32,263
WHAT IS THE NEW PLATFORM?

112
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:33,431
WE'LL SPEND THE NEXT FEW YEARS

113
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:36,033
AND WILL TORTURE ANYONE WHO'S

114
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:39,670
REMOTELY ASSOCIATED WITH TRUMP?

115
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,003
PLEASE.

116
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:40,871
THE THUGGISH WIN AT ALL APPROACH

117
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:46,977
WAS ON FULL DISPLAY DURING THE

118
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,278
KAVANAUGH BATTLE.

119
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:52,216
>> DON'T YOU WAVE YOUR HAND AT

120
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:52,483
ME!

121
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:57,988
I WAVE MY HAND AT YOU!

122
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,189
HOW DARE YOU TALK TO WOMEN THAT

123
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,525
WAY!

124
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:03,660
>> WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS!

125
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:11,234
WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS!

126
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,470
>> Laura: IT'S FITTING, ISN'T

127
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:16,473
IT, THE WOMEN ONE OF THE

128
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:17,274
ARCHITECTS OF THE POLITICS OF

129
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:18,440
DESTRUCTION, ALONG WITH

130
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:19,142
CARVILLE, HAS NO PROBLEM WITH

131
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,243
ANY OF THAT.

132
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,712
>> YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH A

133
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,315
POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO

134
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,683
DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR, WHAT

135
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,052
YOU CARE ABOUT.

136
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,754
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IF WE ARE

137
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:34,090
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN BACK THE

138
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,892
HOUSE AND/OR THE SENATE, THAT'S

139
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:38,027
WHEN CIVILITY CAN START AGAIN.

140
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,497
UNTIL THEN, THE ONLY THING THE

141
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,198
REPUBLICANS SEEM TO RECOGNIZE,

142
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,735
AND RESPECT, AND STRENGTH.

143
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:46,669
>> Laura: THIS IS SO JUVENILE.

144
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,640
IT'S LIKE YOUR KID, RIGHT --

145
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,041
"I'LL START BEHAVING, MOMMY,

146
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,477
ONCE I GET THE EXTRA PIECE OF

147
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:55,478
CANDY."

148
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:55,845
OKAY!

149
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,113
UNLESS THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN

150
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:59,849
POWER, THERE CAN BE NO CIVILITY.

151
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,385
YET THEY ARE THE AGENTS OF

152
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,887
MAYHEM THAT WE'VE ENDURED FOR

153
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:04,621
TWO YEARS NOW.

154
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:05,522
THIS IS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING

155
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:09,259
SINCE ELECTION NIGHT!

156
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,860
HILLARY WOULD RATHER SEE THE

157
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,061
COUNTRY SWALLOWED UP BY DISCORD

158
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,664
AND ANGER THEN TO ADMIT THE

159
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:15,865
TRUMP POLICIES ARE ACTUALLY

160
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,866
BEARING FRUIT.

161
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,936
MY FRIENDS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT

162
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,604
FOISTING A LIBERAL CONSTRUCT ON

163
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,239
AMERICA.

164
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,441
NO TONALITY, THE SET OF

165
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,477
PRECEPTS, BASICALLY, ABOUT OPEN

166
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,212
BORDERS, OPEN MARKETS, MAY BE

167
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:31,047
TOSSING IN GENDER VALIDITY FOR

168
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:31,481
GOOD MEASURE.

169
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:33,182
ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE ACCEPTED

170
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:36,052
OR ELSE.

171
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,854
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SOFTER,

172
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,455
KINDER HILLARY WE HEARD FROM

173
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:42,024
JUST TWO YEARS AGO.

174
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:44,026
>> WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT

175
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,628
FINDING WAYS TO DISAGREE ON

176
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,730
MATTERS OF POLICY WHILE AGREEING

177
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,465
ON QUESTIONS OF DECENCY AND

178
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:49,832
CIVILITY.

179
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,235
HOW WE TALK TO EACH OTHER, TREAT

180
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:55,571
EACH OTHER, RESPECT EACH OTHER.

181
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,040
>> Laura: ISN'T THAT NICE AT

182
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:58,875
THE AL SMITH DINNER?

183
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:00,476
THAT'S SO NICE.

184
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,644
UNLESS OUR CAMPAIGN GOES DOWN IN

185
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,446
FLAMES, IN OTHER WORDS, AND

186
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,214
UNLESS OUR OPPONENTS FULFILL HIS

187
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:07,083
PROMISES, IN WHICH CASE WE WILL

188
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:10,419
SCORCH THE EARTH, CIVILITY BE

189
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,321
DAMNED.

190
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,856
HILLARY COULD NOT LET THE MOMENT

191
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:15,057
TO PASS FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH TO

192
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,058
HAVE HIS CEREMONIAL SWEARING IN

193
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,627
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

194
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,262
>> WHAT WAS DONE LAST NIGHT IN

195
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,364
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS A POLITICAL

196
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,899
RALLY.

197
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,000
IT FURTHER UNDERMINED THE IMAGE

198
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:28,838
AND INTEGRITY OF THE COURT.

199
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,872
AND THAT TROUBLES ME GREATLY.

200
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:34,243
SADDENS ME BECAUSE OUR JUDICIAL

201
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:34,977
SYSTEM HAS BEEN VIEWED AS ONE OF

202
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,847
THE MAIN PILLARS OF OUR

203
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:39,682
CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.

204
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:43,018
>> Laura: AND IN WHAT WAY WAS

205
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,854
THIS A POLITICAL RALLY?

206
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,388
I WAS ACTUALLY THERE LAST NIGHT.

207
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,657
OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE EXCITED.

208
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,859
JUST LIKE WHEN DEMOCRAT

209
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,994
PRESIDENT GETS TWO JUSTICES OR

210
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,062
ONE JUSTICE?

211
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:53,662
THEY ARE EXCITED.

212
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,530
IT'S A VICTORY.

213
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,799
YOU CAN'T CELEBRATE VICTORIES,

214
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,902
ONLY FOUR DEMOCRATS?

215
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:00,836
ALL THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

216
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,805
WERE SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW,

217
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:04,206
INCLUDING THE ONE APPOINTED BY

218
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,942
YOUR HUSBAND, HILLARY.

219
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,445
IT WAS A NONPARTISAN MOMENT OF

220
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,013
UNITY AND MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF

221
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,550
HEALING THAT HILLARY REFUSES TO

222
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,051
ACKNOWLEDGE BECAUSE, OF COURSE,

223
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:17,920
SHE HAD NO ROLE IN IT.

224
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,222
THIS IS AT THE HEART OF THE

225
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,290
DEMOCRATS' RESISTANCE.

226
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,059
THEY ARE ACTUALLY RESENTFUL THAT

227
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,262
THE COUNTRY IS MOVING AHEAD,

228
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:28,664
GROWING, THRIVING, RECLAIMING

229
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,431
ITS POWER.

230
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:30,666
ALSO ON THE WORLD STAGE.

231
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,669
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PART IN ANY

232
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,270
OF IT.

233
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,638
BECAUSE TRUMP WAS RIGHT, THEY

234
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,273
WERE WRONG, AND THEY ARE TICKED

235
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:39,641
OFF ABOUT IT.

236
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:40,843
LIBERAL DOGMA AND THE GIVEAWAY

237
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:42,377
POLICIES OF THE PAST, THAT DID

238
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,612
NOT GET US HERE TO REACH

239
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:46,882
ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND

240
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,250
OTHERWISE.

241
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,785
LACKING A GOVERNING AGENDA OR IN

242
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:50,819
THE RESPONSE TO TRUMP'S ECONOMIC

243
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,621
AND GLOBAL SUCCESS?

244
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:54,289
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED TO

245
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,857
RUN ON A PLATFORM OF

246
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:56,858
DEMONIZATION.

247
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:59,227
THEY ARE NOW EVEN USING THE

248
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,296
KAVANAUGH VOTE TO PUNISH THEIR

249
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:01,563
OWN.

250
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,200
DEMOCRAT SENATOR JOE MANCHIN OF

251
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:05,834
WEST VIRGINIA, IN A CLOSE

252
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:10,639
REELECTION RACE, AND CANDIDATE

253
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,473
PHIL DRESDEN BEING LASHED BY THE

254
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:16,278
LEFT FOR THE RESPECTIVE VOTE ON

255
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,645
KAVANAUGH.

256
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:20,583
THE LIBERAL MoveOn.org CLOSE

257
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:22,918
ARE

258
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,921
WITHHOLDING MONIES FROM BOTH

259
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,255
CAMPAIGNS OF THE CANDIDATES.

260
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,858
IF THEY WON'T TOLERATE A LITTLE

261
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,426
BIT OF DIVERSITY AMONG OPINION

262
00:08:31,427 --> 00:00:00,000
AMONG THEIR OWN DEMOCRATIC
