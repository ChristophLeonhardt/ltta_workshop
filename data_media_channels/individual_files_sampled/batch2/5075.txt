the Trump made rush a crisis that has been engulfing the White House this week is actually taking a major turn right now president Trump is inviting Vladimir Putin to the White House for a new separate special meeting the overture comes as Donald Trump's own Intel chief concedes today the Trump didn't take the right approach in his big meeting with Putin this week saying he would have done it a different way to avoid giving Vladimir Putin power by holding this now very controversial meeting without u.s. national security staff in the room ask me how that ought to be conducted I would have suggested a different way but that's not my rule that's not my job so it is what it is it is what it is Coates also making ways by admitting he was kept in the dark when Putin's top officials went into that oval office meeting without national security staff and that was of course another very odd Russia relating meeting that Trump held the White House is pushing forward though with this other meeting amidst nearly universal condemnation of the Helsinki summit which even Trump acknowledged by walking back three different major Russia positions this week including the White House here finally tamping down a provocative attempt to undercut Obama's former US ambassador to Russia because there was this suggestion that he could face a grilling from the Kremlin here's that whole progression he feels very strongly about it and here's an interesting idea well I think that's an incredible offer the president is gonna meet with his team and we'll let you know we have an announcement on that Donald Trump is now disagreed with that proposal now they say it was made in sincerity to use Hera Huckabee Sanders quote it was made sincerity but something they disagree with and they will not be pursuing something they now disagree with Donald Trump did cheer that offer though when he was at Putin's side than leaving it to aides to declare this disagreement just like his spokesperson had to spend this odd exchange about Russia also this week as Russia still targeting the u.s. a chance to speak with the president after his comments and the president was said thank you very much and was saying no to answering questions ah just no to answering questions of course those walk backs pale next to the one that is powering so many jokes and memes this week including this parody Hat spoofing Trump's reference to a double negative to spin his embrace of Putin's defense at the summit the sentence should have been I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia sort of a double negative so clarifies things pretty good by itself so here's where we are Donald Trump forged his entire public brand on firing anyone fighting anyone and never apologizing or backing down his whole aura was reality star meets Tom Petty won't back down gonna stand my ground and I won't back down that was the narrative this week of course exposes the giant exception when it comes to Putin and Russia policy Trump won't fight he looks like he's afraid Putin will fire him he spent four consecutive days backing down and explaining himself and this quite blatant departure from Trump's normal brand has many serious people asking disturbing questions this week it has the New York Times front page with an article questioning what happens when treason may hit the Oval Office because if Russia is the one topic that terms Trump from a relentless Tom Petty fighter to a kind of a bumbling flinching quailing capitulate er a sort of a c-3po of foreign policy then people are gonna ask why just like tonight people are asking why this widely condemned week of Donald Trump's foreign policy towards Russia is being capped at this hour with this developing news of a dramatic red carpet invite for Vladimir Putin to the White House I am joined now by former ambassador to Morocco mark Ginsburg who called Monday's meeting a shame and surrender summit a former New Jersey US Senator Robert Torricelli crack strategist Aisha Moody Mills and Sam cedar hosts the majority report and an analyst for US ambassador I begin with you why is this happening well it's happening largely because of the duress that Trump has received from some supporters particularly Newt Gingrich and a couple of other others on Fox News that got under his skin it's not because of the substance you know he actually is convinced that what he did in in Helsinki was not the equivalent of a Neville Chamberlain surrender or an appeasement of Vladimir Putin but that they accomplished something what he however is saying to the American people Ari is that mr. Putin has something on him that there's a reason why this obsequious kowtow mean to poun permits the president United States to disregard the calamities that Putin is inflicted on the United States in the international community and so in my only humble belief in the efforts that Trump is done to engage Putin separately and away from any prior of any aid it's because mr. Trump is fearful that mr. Putin has something on him well and that's been one of the questions that's getting mainlined because Putin himself was asked about it both at the summit senator as well as in the Fox interview he did which we're going to be touching on later in the hour when you look at all this it seems like even if you forget collusion and that investigation which is not done and doesn't need to be prejudged something very concerning is happening right now between these two men while he's president in some ways it's more profound for national security than perhaps what may or may not have occurred in 2016 it actually the casual observer would appear that Donald Trump is worried that somehow now he's offended Putin by his recent walk backs and is now trying to make amends you think that's what this offers it's certainly to a casual observer would look that way but rather than answering your question I want to answer a question that Brian Williams asked of my favorite former colleague last night Bob Kerry you want to just walk over there and do may God I want to do a lot of things I'm gonna try that I'm gonna try that when I get assignments around here rather than taking this assignment to guest host I'm gonna go to the beach go ahead though he asked Bob last night noting that the real heroes of Watergate were Republicans mm-hmm where's the Howard Baker of this crisis and it occurred to me hearing about this new summit today Mitch McConnell Orrin Hatch Grassley people in the twilight of their careers you're either never gonna be forgiven for being silent these weeks or if you speak up now never forgotten Mitch McConnell needs to go to the president and say when Vladimir Putin comes back to this country for the sake of American security our credibility with our allies the credibility of your office the functioning of this government you are not to meet with him alone and if you do you cannot count on me when the report comes out from from Muller make it clear and put it on the line otherwise what a lie is ever going to share with intelligence that's with us about Russia again and how are we going to restore credibility to this administration yeah I totally agree with that and I just want to step back for a minute and you know we need to be asking some deeper questions about the president's behavior and why you mean the kind of questions that probably Williams on the questions that are worth raised on this you know worth answering but it really we should all just be alarmed personally offended but our country is in jeopardy right now this is not just a political issue and we often like get on TV and we political politicize right is at stake for our Nationals why does that state for our national security is what the Republicans on the hill should care about and the fact that we have this man who is behaving erratically he doesn't seem to have any kind of memory a lack of empathy there's something that is just very pathological about the way that he is operating that there's a reason why we have three branches of government if there is any moment in time that Congress should step up and say wait a minute some about judgment isn't right we actually need to exercise better judgment where they should but we saw today that the Republicans are cowards in Congress because they refused to even just pad to vote and say that we support our intelligence community and we agree and we know it to be true that the Russians have meddled so I don't know if we're gonna get to where you think that we should be yeah and I would say you know even even if you back up just to the lack of transparency throughout this entire process is problematic from a Democratic standpoint I mean not they know it's a small d democratic like the idea that these two men are meeting without any record whatsoever is just it and without any notion of what the agenda is is just fundamentally wrong before you even get to these these second and third-order questions which i you know are increasingly becoming first-order questions which is a question that conservatives often like to pose in the legal process which is if you're not guilty why are you hiding well yes and also you're the president of a vey you're democratically elected president when you go in and you meet with this world leader we have a right to be aware of what is being discussed at least in broad straw I would push you on that and say the national security apparatus has a right the entire public is not always going to be reading on the classified our Republic with the notion to your point the notion isms the notion that that the National Intelligence director sitting down with our own Andrea Mitchell tonight is saying in public perhaps as a signal to people that something's off yes I am being kept out of the loop on this and I know more than the president I'm supposed to be guarding our nation's secrets in a non-partisan way right why is he being kept out well I mean that's the question and I'll tell you the fact that he's going public with this I think it's pretty stunning I mean there is there's there's a lot of red flags being waved around in in a lot of different quarters right now that I think you know there's there's this sort of like soft attempt maybe it's getting harder but it's soft its soft it's wait when we look back at this historically people are going to say I have great respect for general Matheson and for Pompeo history is going to ask where were you if the United States of security is now being compromised acrylic bitterly the office of the President the United States is clearly at issue mm-hmm where were you and to all of you and I go back to Mitch McConnell about meeting with the president about insisting that there be someone else in that room and I go to the president's cabinet are these jobs so valuable he is being in the cabinet so important to you that you would allow the country to be compromised and allow your own reputation to be sullied perhaps not today but in the eyes of history is there not a Howard Baker in the entire United States government mhm let me let me take that let me take the Patriots higher United States government I mean that's the challenge right so the entire cabinet is completely neutered right now you already know the answer to this question Mitch McConnell wouldn't even let you know what's going to was going to punish politically anyone who has mentioned this prior to the run-up of the election Mitch McConnell has made his bed I don't think there is going to be this moment where Mitch McConnell all of a sudden becomes a different person right and that goes to whether people are not only standing by but potentially allegedly welcoming the kind of interference that actually subverts the democracy that is a type of as charged in a molar indictment an international election related conspiracy ambassador is someone who's served I'll take the question to you and I'll play for you some of the reaction to something that was the big story earlier today before again is we're reporting night before Donald Trump just made a new offer to Vladimir Putin to come to the White House before that there was the White House basically leaving up in the air that maybe they would let the Kremlin depose people like yourself who've been ambassadors before to Russia take a listen to some of the response to that insanity that the administration to even entertain this it shows to me how naive they are the president would work with flat Amir Putin to put in danger our ambassador strikes me is almost providing aid and comfort to the enemy it was incredible all right let her play stupid idea - you know by Putin it's continually walking back it's a big problem I can't imagine the cartwheels they're doing over in Russia ambassador Ginsburg you have held this type of post what was your view of that which the White House is walking away from and have you ever heard of the US government trying to make that kind of deal with Russia never never have I ever in all my years going back to the days that I worked for senator Kennedy on the hill never have I seen any obsequious nasai dia that Trump could call this an incredible offer and put in jeopardy first of all my good friend Michael McFaul former ambassador Russia who during his tour of duty in Russia was subjected to the worst type of harassment by Putin and by his thugs his family himself undermining the integrity anything that represented the protection of the Vienna Convention for diplomats Putin will stop at nothing and by the way may I add the fact that Putin offered to let Muller come over and question his agencies military agents always shows you that Putin knew and in effect recognizes that these were people who work for him so maybe in the end we got that little piece out of it but let me make it very clear Ari the fact that this White House required people like Mike McFaul and mr. Browder to have to worry whether or not their they would be served up on a silver platter to mr. Putin by the president United States is despicable I think it's well put and it's one of the many things that the White House may be trying to run from tonight with the other moves it's making which are also obviously newsworthy the invite to the White House for Putin and yet I was a remarkable piece of statecraft over these over these last few days that it was even as you say put out there Ambassador Ginsburg my thanks to you for your expertise senator Robert Torricelli who comes on this show but but likes a lot of different shows and that's you're right yeah but you're right that view hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
