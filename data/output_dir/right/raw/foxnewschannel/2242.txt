00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:18,493
BOMBSHELL REPORT FROM ISRAELI

3
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:20,962
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NET AND

4
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:23,365
YAHOO, IRAN WAS LYING BEFORE THE

5
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:25,300
SIGNING OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,969
DEAL.

7
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,305
>> A START WARNING THAT IRAN HID

8
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:32,807
A VAST ATOMIC ARCHIVE FROM THE

9
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:35,644
WORLD UNTIL TODAY.

10
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:40,482
DR. REBECCA GRANT, WE REALLY

11
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:40,915
APPRECIATE IT.

12
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,753
HOW DOES THIS NOT HELP AND HURT

13
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,355
US?

14
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:48,089
>> THE INFORMATION IS AUTHENTIC,

15
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,659
THE QUESTION IS ABOUT THE

16
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:51,993
TIMING.

17
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:54,896
ON THE ONE HAND THIS SHOWS TRUMP

18
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:58,600
WAS RIGHT TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,770
THIS DEAL.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,972
IN DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS WITH

21
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:06,007
EUROPE, RUSSIA AND CHINA HOW TO

22
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:06,741
MODIFY THE DEAL, SO THE QUESTION

23
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:09,678
GOING FORWARD IS CAN THE BIG FIX

24
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:10,378
THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO THIS

25
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:17,952
DEAL FIND A GOOD WAY TO MODIFY

26
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,219
IT.

27
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:18,953
>> THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS

28
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,587
AMOUNTS TO IRAN ACTUALLY

29
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:24,859
CHEATING ON THE DEAL AND THAT IS

30
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,527
WHAT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO

31
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:26,261
FIGURE OUT, WHETHER OR NOT LYING

32
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:26,995
IN THE YEARS AND MONTHS BEFORE

33
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:29,531
SIGNING THE DEAL MEANS THE DEAL,

34
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:36,705
HOW DO YOU SEE IT?

35
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:41,076
>> WE ARE PURSUING NUCLEAR

36
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:45,413
WEAPONS PROGRAM, AND THE

37
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:53,922
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY, THEY ARE

38
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:54,656
STILL TECHNICALLY IN COMPLIANCE.

39
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,557
AND TECHNICALLY IN COMPLIANCE

40
00:01:55,557 --> 00:02:00,662
BUT WE KNOW THIS IS NOT A GOOD

41
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,262
SITUATION GOING FORWARD.

42
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:05,934
PATTY: 1 SPECIAL REPORT LAST

43
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:06,668
NIGHT, THIS ISN'T A SMOKING GUN

44
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,202
BUT A SMOKING BOMB.

45
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:11,406
DO YOU AGREE?

46
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:14,676
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS?

47
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:22,417
>> THIS IS PARTLY A BLOW BY

48
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:23,118
ISRAEL AGAINST IRAN, THEY ARE

49
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:23,852
SKIRMISHING, THEY ATTACKED EACH

50
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,552
OTHER BIT'S BASIS, BUT DON'T

51
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:28,256
INCURSION, SHOWDOWN, THIS IS THE

52
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:28,957
FIGHT GOING ON BETWEEN ISRAEL

53
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:29,324
AND IRAN.

54
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:29,991
IT IS SIGNIFICANT THEY ARE

55
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,993
CHEATING BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH

56
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,062
IN ITSELF TO GET WHERE WE NEED

57
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,964
TO GO.

58
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:37,465
WE NEED AGREEMENT AMONG

59
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:43,171
SIGNATORIES AND IRAN TO ACCEPT

60
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:43,772
RESTRICTIONS ON MISSILE

61
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:44,172
DEVELOPMENT.

62
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:44,739
WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO.

63
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,343
I EXPECT A BUMPY RIDE AND OIL

64
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:55,083
PRICES WILL BOUNCE AROUND AS WE

65
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:55,683
SEE THIS GOING FORWARD.

66
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:56,418
ROB: ALLIES SAY ENDING THIS DEAL

67
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:57,118
IS NOT A GOOD IDEA, IRAN WAS

68
00:02:57,118 --> 00:02:57,852
GIVEN SO MUCH AT THE BEGINNING

69
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:02,056
OF THE DEAL, BUT TO QUOTE THE

70
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:06,494
AMBASSADOR, AND BILLIONS OF

71
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:08,930
DOLLARS, IN SANCTIONS BUT WE

72
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:18,173
RE-UP THIS THING.

73
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:18,907
AND MORE MONEY, YOU HAVE A DEAL

74
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,974
YOU SIGN, A LOT OF OUR ALLIES

75
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:25,346
THINK WE NEED TO STAY IN.

76
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:25,947
THEN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.

77
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:26,614
>> WE KNOW THE DEAL WAS BAD

78
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,315
BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN

79
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:28,016
MORE AT THE TIME BUT EVERYONE

80
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:31,586
WANTS A DEAL WITH IRAN.

81
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,287
WE JUST NEED IT TO BE A GOOD

82
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:32,587
DEAL.

83
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,555
IT ISN'T A GOOD DEAL NOW, NEEDS

84
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:34,022
TO BE STRONGER.

85
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:38,426
TRUMP HAS BEEN PATIENT, CLEAR TO

86
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,961
ME HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN OR

87
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:43,598
MODIFY IT TO KEEP IRAN FROM

88
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,265
DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

89
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:49,370
IT COMES DOWN TO WHETHER FRANCE,

90
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,104
GERMANY, THE UK AND US CAN AGREE

91
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,308
ON SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE THEM

92
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:54,008
STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, THE

93
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,910
DEAL ENDS AND THEY CAN ENRICH

94
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,444
URANIUM RIGHT AWAY.

95
00:03:56,444 --> 00:00:00,000
IRAN IS NOT HELPING, THEY SAY WE
