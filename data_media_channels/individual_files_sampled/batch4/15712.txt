it was a strange day in London on the second anniversary of the brexit vote it felt like the whole place was shouting over 50,000 of London's privileged class March to stop brexit demanding a second referendum they called it the people's vote forgetting the people had already voted I joined the March but given threats of violence against me by this side I was Joan O'Brien for the day staunch remainer in a dodgy wig and stickers and then we want to be able to to vote again that is democracy is democracy voting again yes of course it is what they voted for isn't what they're getting so the people that voted leave were tricked we just believe that it should be us or by a second referendum dressed in European flags chanting bollocks to brexit I've never seen so many white people over 40 in one place in London I was blinded by the White House trains given these people of the globalists through open borders refugees welcome and yet there's none in sight here none close to them no multi-culture for these people a wealthy white elite isolated from the reality of the politics they support and the migrants they welcome this was a collective scream of angst against any disruption to their privileged lives in the London bubble just around the corner Trafalgar Square was fenced off for an Eid celebration funded by the Mayor of London he knows how to please his voting base a rap artist on the stage bragged about his time on the wrong side of the law meanwhile the muslim police association had a special stand of their very own i repeat the muslim police association just how far are we through sharia law muslim families having fun in the sunshine but then i saw just that muslim families with other muslim families a sea of one culture celebrating itself another silo just like the Romaniacs screaming bollocks to brexit up the road the brexit ears also marched some shouting Tommy Tommy Tommy Tommy Robinson others but Britain or brexit with their flags the Union the cross of st. George the identitarian 's and more regular Londoners grafted ex-military an ordinary Brits despairing of a country we barely recognise desperate for a change in a break from being at the back of the queue we know why we don't leave and we want our country back oh I wonder what is the true face of London or the true voice of Britain is it the Muslims with their Muslim police association and their own Muslim celebration funded by the Muslim mayor is it the remainders white middle-aged and wealthy with their matching European flags postcode and boarding school pedigree is it the brexit ears desperate believed to happen yearning for a country to be proud of with strong borders and a clear sense of identity to defend there is no one answer if you surround yourself with those you agree with shouting in unison at the sky what exactly are you achieving perhaps it makes us feel better less alone look other people feel this way too it's not just me against the madness but step back away from all this self-soothing and the bigger picture is far less reassuring we are a divided nation Britain has never been more divided this is silo city then against you against us you
