look at this video it's a photographer with the Toronto Sun Stan Bahamas his name who was attacked by an antipholus right in downtown Toronto on Saturday here watch it again I mean it's obvious but I'll say it he wasn't a picking a fight he wasn't it wasn't punching anyone his hands were holding his camera he was covering a demonstration an tyfa which stands for anti-fascist but of course they're the fascists these days they attacked him unprovoked there were cameras everywhere everywhere there of course of being the age of the smartphone so the anti-fascist the anti-fascist fascist there will be plenty of photos of him and here's a photo that our friend Joe Warmington of the Sun Stan's colleague says was the guy who did the punching Joe was right there that's him and that you can see our friend Sue Ann levy right there - right there when the punch has happened and can you see that there's no fewer than seven Toronto police within like a few feet and arms reach the incident they're the ones wearing the bike helmet so you see that not one of them lifted a finger no one no one of them moved they all saw it you can see that looking at it it was right in front of them Stan it's just a photographer he's middle-aged it wasn't provoking anyone he wasn't arguing wasn't shouting wasn't cursing he wasn't doing anything but standing there doing his job taking pictures which is what you do at a demonstration there's doing nothing and the police did nothing and why is that you know there's a phenomenon an internet you know it inspired prank where people see a live TV broadcast on the street and they walk right up to the reporter and they shout into the microphone on live TV they say f uck her right in the PU ssy it's it's bizarre it's an urban phenomenon it's an internet meme it happens all the time across North America and by the way it happens both by men and women who do it and to both men and women reported its route it's shocking it's profane it's disruptive but it's not violent and it's not against the law but in Canada the media party is so upset when it happens to them that they go on the warpath they literally demand the police arrest the swearing hecklers and of course in one famous case in Toronto they got the guy fired from his government job he was later rehired now it's rude sure but what possible law does the swearing violate but the police get right on those and the media demands that especially the CBC because saying eff her right in the P is obviously sexist and sexism is pretty much the worst crime you can imagine even if it's just a heckle so that's the standard so why the total lack of anything forced and bahala the Sun Dog refer who was punched why the silence of the police and the silence of the rest of the media the ones who circled the wagons feels poor CBC reporters who had to hear a swear word for the first time in their life it's a swear word not directed at the journalist by the way this is swearing in general is that worse than being punched in the face I wouldn't think so but it's the Toronto Police an increasingly political organization run by an increasingly political chief and political Commissioner and political mayor and let's be honest the Toronto Sun is to the fancy people just one inch more respectable than the rabble yeah the rabble so if some left-wing activists in an tyfa really the paramilitary wing of Justin Trudeau's liberals if Trudeau's street gangs punch the Toronto Sun reporter in the face well that's okay because the Toronto Sun was asking for it right that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
