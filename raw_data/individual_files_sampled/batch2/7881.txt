actor Jon Voight went on fox news to discuss Donald Trump and the segment got very very weird so he supported Donald Trump early John Boy yeah you said there's two reasons one you liked the fact that he had clarity and he fought right fought back what was the second well there's a there's a no there were several things in there but the one of the things that that made him separated from all the rest was the fact that he had enough money to to run his campaign and he didn't have to seek huge amounts of funds for his re-election to keep somebody in his pocket so he could always have that cash to run on now this area is a very tough one for Canada for people who are in politics it's a it's it should be looked at it should be repaired because it's a it's going way beyond what it should the amount of money that these that even local politicians have to raise is out of line but you like that he was self-funding he was self funding and and that meant that he wouldn't have anybody that he had to you know that was that he had to appeal to in his decisions which would have to be very strong in tough decisions somebody had to be there because a lot of courage what he'd certainly seemed to have a lot of courage and he didn't have that other thing so he all of these people have to they have I can see in the decisions I know some of these people some of these politicians good guys who were beholding to you know some of the people that they've connected to to run their campaigns and they're bending in those in their you know in support of non-supported this or that decisions are being swayed by by this relationship he didn't have it what do you make of the virulence of the attacks against him is this the old left that you that you left in the media now and what certainly is the left doing it and the very lens is because he's effective that's that's what the variance comes from he's actually doing what he said he would do the amazing thing in itself isn't it but he's actually accomplishing returning to our basic principles of government that were given to us by those guys on the wall there was conservative a woman actress very good one and I said so what do you think about our man and she just did this that was a that's that's me crying what was her - white saying because it's so first of all the gesture was so beautiful she couldn't even speak she was just saying thank God and I say thank God and one of the reasons why I can say thank God is it because I I know he's there you know for us all God and that's one of the things that we've lost is this compass of God we have what did Carl Marx come up with he eliminated God from the picture so we can do it without this what an uncomfortable interview that was okay so the god thing is come on man I don't get it I don't get it yeah you don't get to say that like oh I know he's up there I know he's up there it's one thing to be religious okay fine nothing wrong with that it's another thing to add that level of certitude which is just made up you're just making it up because you don't know cuz you're a human being and then he goes on to make very overt theocratic argument so like the founders believe in God and they wanted us all to do it to it solo no actually many of the founders were deists and there's a reason why we have separation of church and state in our Constitution but they totally overlooked that and they pretend like the founders were you know like Pat Robertson today and Rush Limbaugh and shit so the god stuff is just incredibly creepy which leads to the next point of I hear all the time from guys like Ben Shapiro that facts don't care about your feelings and I also hear all the time that lefties are emotional and they let their emotion cloud their better judgment and they make decisions from their heart instead of their head and what I saw there from Jon Voight is everything that the far-right accused the left accuses the left of he's crying talking about trial hey what do you think of our man I would talk but I can't thank God thank God for what exactly fill in the blank for what exactly thank God cuz I know he's there I know he's there just picture it from a different religion and you'll see how goofy it is you will see it you will see it it's like if you're watching Iranian TV or Saudi TV and somebody's screaming Allahu Akbar and they know that a lies there it's everybody would look at and go no you don't but with Jon Voight it's the same thing just a different religion so he doesn't know and it's creepy to see him act so sure of himself now furthermore when he to the extent he actually brings up anything policy-wise he says well here's why the left hates him the left hates him because he's doing what he said he would do now that's as specific as he gets and he's not even bringing up policy but that's not true either Jon on the campaign trail Trump said repeatedly what are we doing in Afghanistan we need to get out of Afghanistan and rebuild our own country have we gotten out of Afghanistan no in fact he's kept us there longer and he's increased troop levels there have we done a big infrastructure bill no he proposed a half-baked one awhile ago but it was all privatizing all of our infrastructure which is a horrendous idea so he hasn't done the infrastructure bill he hasn't gotten our troops out of Afghanistan in fact he's kept him there he said the same thing about Iraq but he did the opposite again and the list goes on and on on all the issues he said remember when he said he got Republicans to put bringing back glass-steagall in the platform you remember that I remember that I covered it I gave him credit for it has he said anything about that since he got elected no of course not he said get rid of the carried interest loophole did he get rid of no course not the idea that he did what he said he was going to do is utter nonsense maybe there are very specific areas where he did but the overwhelming majority he did not he did not at all so he is a tool of the establishment and the fact that people are being so irrational that they can't realize that he is doing the bidding of the establishment Wall Street billionaires corporations you name it the fact that people don't realize that is mind-boggling guys he's effectively eliminated the EPA that's not hyperbole first he put scott pruett in charge there scott pruett had sued the epa over a dozen times that's the guy he put as the head of the EPA now Pruitt's gone who did he put in his place a coal lobbyist he's just a mm-hmm come on John what is it what are you saying and what are you doing and then the final point is this listen I actually at the beginning of what he was saying I sympathized a little bit because he was saying it oh my god the reason why one of the main reasons why I love Trump is because Trump was self-funding and you know that allows him to escape the corrupting influence of big money so I'm listening to and I okay yes that's a reasonable that's an understandable thing for somebody to say as to why they thought it would make sense to support Trump here's the problem with it though John it's not true that's not true he didn't actually self finance his campaign and furthermore uh he trumped during the primary attack Jeb Bush for raising money from this big money a guy who would you know basically bundle money from all different big-money sources and then he would fund Jeb Bush well as soon as Trump got through the primary he got to the general he had a ripped Jeb Bush for being a puppet to this donor soon as Trump got to the general he's like okay that guy is now gonna work for me so again goes right back on everything he said because that's how Trump is he has no principles he has no belief soldiers flip-flop on daily basis doesn't mean care and then on top of that the whole like I'm self-funding my campaign on top of not being true there was a and expose that we covered on this show and I was mad that other outlets didn't pick it up but it was out it as a marketing scheme so I actually know the details of what happened behind the scenes that the dynamic of it Donald Trump was begging to meet with Mitt Romney's main campaign guy and so he was begging this guy for a meeting because he has the reputation to being the best fundraiser and and all that so a Trump was begging this guy for a meeting the guy blew him off two or three times finally Trump asked like a fourth time the guy was like okay on me with you now this guy and his head is going Donald fucking Trump as a joke I'm not gonna work with Donald Trump I don't even he's gonna run for president so he meets with this guy Trump tells them I am thinking of running for president will you work for me so in other words this is Trump playing the game and going I'm gonna need to raise big money so I'm gonna need you working with me now this guy thinks Donald Trump is a joke despises him so what does he say in the meeting he he and this is all detail I think it was political who wrote it but I'm not sure don't quote me on that there was an old story we covered it on secular talk if you can find it you know good luck but you'll see though all the details of the story what happened was this guy who had work with Mitt Romney big money funder you know organizer all that in order to get out of the meeting with Donald Trump because he was so annoyed by Donald Trump and he didn't take him seriously and he thought he was a clown he didn't want to work for him in order to get out of that meeting he goes well you know Don I would want to work with you but I think that maybe what you should do is maybe say that you're self funding your campaign and this way you'll have more appeal because people will think you're not corrupt and Trump was like I love that idea so this guy was just trying to get out of a meeting with Trump and then Trump actually took the advice which turned out to be good advice even though Mitt Romney's guy didn't really know that who's just trying to get out of the meeting and then as they're working so he's full of shit he's full of shit is the point and that was all a marketing scheme and it worked and but now the thing that annoys me is a lot of the people who were on team Trump have now realized oh shit I've been had I was wrong but I can grow and learn from it but there are some guys like Jon Voight who are just silly and they're in a cult and they cry when somebody brings up Trump and that's just sad it really doesn't speak well of your intelligence if at this late date you can't piece it together that you've been had but then again he's Rich's fuck so he hasn't he's got plenty of money he's fine but you know if you're a working-class person and you went for Trump you've definitely been had
