11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,199
incompetent musician who was like the

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,300
precursor to joke blue man that scene

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,590
where he gets locked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the greenhouse</font>

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,829
absolute classic but especially for

22
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,620

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,170
Christmas movie scene where snow miser
