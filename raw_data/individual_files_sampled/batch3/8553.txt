Laura: IT'S NO SECRET THAT MOST JOURNALISTS LEAN LEFT, OR THAT THEY WOULD FIND A VULGAR AND FAR LEFT DINNER SPEAKER SO FUNNY. BY THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION EXTOLS ITS COMMITMENT TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND AN INDEPENDENT MEDIA. HOW INDEPENDENT IS THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS THAT IS SO OVERWHELMINGLY LEFTIST? HOW CAN IT BE INDEPENDENT? HOW COMMITTED TO FREE SPEECH AS A GROUP THAT ONLY INVITES COMEDIANS TO THEIR MARQUEE DINNER WHO ATTACKED THE RIGHT? LET'S EXAMINE THIS HYPOCRISY WITH JEFFREY LORD OF THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR, HOST OF "OUR RECORD STORIES," AND ARI FLEISCHER, GEORGE W. BUSH'S FIRST PRESS SECRETARY. GREAT IS THE ALL OF YOU TONIGHT. LET'S START WITH YOU, ARI. DID YOU GO TO THE DINNER? YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T GO. YOU'VE BEEN TO ENOUGH OF THOSE. I HAVEN'T BEEN TO ONE OF THOSE I'M HAPPY TO REPORT. Laura: WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED SEEING THE CLIPS ROLE IN? FRANKLY, LAURA, UNTIL I SAW IT ON YOUR SHOW, I HAD NO IDEA HOW VULGAR IT WAS REALLY WAS. I HATE SEEING A LOT OF THE EXCERPTS, THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT KELLYANNE, THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT SARAH HOW COULD COULD BUT I DID NOT KNOW HOW BAD IT WAS. A REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THE PRICES KILLING THEMSELVES. THEY JUST DON'T GET IT. THEY ARE AN INDUSTRY IN DECLINE AND THEY ARE IN DECLINE BECAUSE HALF OF AMERICA, THE CONSERVATIVE HALF, DOES NOT TRUST THEM. EVENTS LIKE THIS JUST MAKE IT WORSE AND THE PRESS STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW BAD LAST NIGHT WAS. WHEN YOU HEAR JUAN WILLIAMS DEFENDED, WHEN YOU HEAR ONE OF THE MOST REASONABLE LIBERALS DEFENDED, AS YOU POINTED OUT, LAURA, SCAN THE CROWD, THE LAUGHTER, THE PRESS DOESN'T GET IT. Laura: LEE, I WANT TO GO TO YOU. YOU ARE MY OLD EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND RADIO AND PARTNER IN CRIME 17 YEARS AGO, BACK TO LAW SCHOOL. LEE, IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO PLAY A LOT OF THESE SOUND BITES TONIGHT. YOU SAID, A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE THIS, THEY HAVE TO SEE JUST HOW VULGAR AND FLOW IT WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW FAR WE'VE SUNK WITH THE MEDIA AND THE SO-CALLED DEFENSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THE DOUBLE STANDARD HERE IS GLARING FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE IT, ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN, THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, "I AM WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR," ALL OF THAT. WHAT'S FUNNY, LAURA, FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE'VE HEARD THE PRESS EXCORIATED FOR LACK OF VETTING BY THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY DIDN'T DO A PROPER JOB WITH THE VETERANS AFFAIRS GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ULTIMATELY DISMISSED AND YET THEY COULD NOT BUT THIS COMEDIAN? DON'T THEY HAVE YOUTUBE? DON'T THEY HAVE GOOGLE? CAN'T THEY WATCH THIS WOMAN'S PERFORMANCE ON "THE DAILY SHOW"? WHAT IS FASCINATING, LAURA, WHAT JUAN WILLIAMS MUST COME AND 95% OF JOKES WERE IN BETTER REPUBLICANS. SHE DID NOT SPREAD IT AROUND. SHE TARGETED MOSTLY WOMEN. 67 MINUTES STRAIGHT, VILE, REPULSIVE JOKES, THEY WERE AIMED AT WOMEN. THESE WERE NOT JUST JOKES. IT WAS LIKE A PUBLIC SHAMING. IT WAS JUST DISGRACEFUL. TO LISTEN TO THE AUDIENCE LAUGH, AND WE WISH WE COULD SEE WHO WAS LAUGHING AND AT WHAT, BECAUSE THESE JOKES WERE DISGRACEFUL, AND THE LAUGHS CONTINUED AND THEY CONTINUED. ON THE KEY HERE, LAURA, THERE WAS A WINNER HERE. THEY WERE TWO WINNERS. ONE WAS A COMEDIAN BECAUSE MY GOODNESS, SHE'S GOING TO GET A REALLY BIG DEAL WITH HBO. SHE'LL BE FOLLOWING BILL MAHER IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS. SHE WAS PLAYING TO HER AUDIENCE, ILLIBERAL SET OF JOURNALISTS, AND TRUMP, BY THE WAY, WAS A WINNER TO COME OF THE SMARTEST MAN NOT IN THE ROOM. HE WAS PLAYING TO HIS AUDIENCE, AMERICA, AMERICA. Laura: JEFFREY LORD, YOU WROTE A PIECE FOR "THE SPECTATOR" ABOUT THIS. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND BEATING BACK THOSE WHO WOULD WANT TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE FROM SPEAKING OUT ON ANY ISSUE, YET THERE WAS SOMETHING DESPERATELY MISSING AT SATURDAY NIGHT'S DINNER. THAT'S RIGHT, FIRST I HAVE TO TELL YOU, BREAKING NEWS, THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS COMMISSION IS STARTING TO INVESTIGATE THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION FOR A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN 2020. YOU SEE THESE CLUBS THAT YOU PLAY, ALL THROUGH THE ELECTION SEASON, I GUARANTEE. Laura: LET'S GO THROUGH 2018, FIRST, JEFFREY. GOOD POINT. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, LAURA. THIS IS THE KIND OF THING AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I ASKED THE PRESIDENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION SEVERAL DAYS AHEAD OF THE DINNER WHETHER THEY WOULD SPECIFICALLY BEAT OFFENDING CONSERVATIVES BY NAME, I INCLUDED YOU, SEAN HANNITY, KEVIN WILLIAMS, AND I GOT NO RESPONSE. TOTAL, COMPLETE SILENCE. THIS IS THE SERIOUS THING HERE. BASICALLY, THIS BOILS DOWN TO FREE SPEECH FOR ME BUT NOT FOR THE PARADE WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, THEY ARE NOT FAIR FOR CONSERVATIVES. THAT IS A REAL SERIOUS PROBLEM. YOU SEE IT NOT JUST IN TELEVISION AND RADIO BUT YOU SEE IT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. GOOD LORD, WHEN BENJI PERIO NEEDS SERIOUS POLICE PROTECTION AND THERE IS A RIOT TO GIVE A SPEECH IN A COLLEGE CAMPUS, OR ANN COULTER HAS TO CANCEL SOMETHING, BECAUSE OF A THREAT OF VIOLENCE, WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE? THERE IS NOT A PEEP TO BE HEARD FROM THEM AND IT'S DISGRACEFUL. Laura: ARI, I WANT TO GO TO YOU. WHETHER IT IS THIS COMEDIAN RIDICULING AN ABORTION OR TALKING ABOUT KNOCKING THE BABY OUT, THE FIRST DAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP IS DESCRIBED IN THE MOST DISGUSTING MANNER, I THINK THOSE ARE GIFTS TO AMERICANS WHO MIGHT BE KIND OF OH, IT'S A MIDTERM ELECTION CYCLE, I WANT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS TEND TO ALWAYS TAKE IT TOO FAR. THEY GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT AND THEY END UP OFFENDING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ALL THAT POLITICAL BUT THEY FIND THIS GROSS. THEY FIND IT'S GROSS. THIS NEW MELANIA POLL, LOOKS LIKE 16,000 REGISTERED VOTERS
