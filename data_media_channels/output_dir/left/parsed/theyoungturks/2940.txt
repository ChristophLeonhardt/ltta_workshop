so Jimmy was convinced that Trump
couldn't win the election
you guys have talked me into increasing
the Trump's hundred thousand dollars -
you really gonna give me a thousand
dollars you domination or general
election he wins general election okay
okay I'm gonna be a man of my word and
I'm gonna make that bad go through a ten
minute explanation and then Jimmy at the
end panik's a little bit and says this
like that you're getting a little scared
so I'm gonna ask your help here on how
much I should make Jimmy pay $1,000 cuz
that was the bet $100 for a ten to one
bet and that's the one we shook on $500
because at the end we said 501 or C come
on that was all good fun let him go let
him go of all the polls we've ever done
this probably will have the most effect
and Jimmy will probably vote a thousand
times so out vote him to throw away
little fun segment I did yesterday about
the bed I had with Jimmy Dore there's 27
thousand votes on what else don't look
at is that more than normal
oh this like 10x the results are so
neck-and-neck that it makes it the
second layer of interesting okay I'll
confess what I voted for I voted for 500
bucks let him go is that 45.8% thousand
dollars is at forty seven point four
percent so the basic streams er the
height basically 47 to 46 this is
apparently the most important thing
that's ever I think so go vote people
wanna stop that all right guys the vote
is unbelievable there's now over 31,000
votes that's insane and it is so close
this could come down to one vote
it's yeah we might have to Reno why am i
nervous it has nothing to do with fun
fact Jimmy Dore is going to
old-school tonight so oh boy
we're gonna find out what is gonna
happen is he going to pay the bed did
you tell him you were gonna pull it
before you pulled it no this is election
night it's election night at TYT people
are going out and voting on our polls
internally like I've never seen people
be like hold up hold up I'm voting on it
too you are depot well we'll see you at
old school you never know what happens
it's TYT folks it's jimmy dore versus j
huger we had Calculon ski find a clip
from talk about a guy who needs a
girlfriend what the right now is

hundred and forty three votes Wow
so five hundred dollars came in at only
five percent okay and now it's two
thousand one hundred and thirteen votes

votes let him go Oh No
