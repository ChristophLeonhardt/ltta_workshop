6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,490
last week and that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an absolute</font>

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,750
pain and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't really do anything</font>

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,520
and I felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> horrible forget how just</font>

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,980
rubbish<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel cuz you can't read</font>

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">because your eyes can't concentrate on</font>

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,539
things and not being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read is</font>

12
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,060
bleak and dire and horrible for me so I

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,650
was watching a lot of television but not

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">really even enjoying it and missing out</font>

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,180
on the Sun really I went for a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,280
walks and sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the garden a bit but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,079
feel like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoying it but i'm back</font>

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,399
i'm doing a few shifts at the bookshop

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,070

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,920
fun and it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> sunny again my sister</font>

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,949
stuck in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Milan and I know that there's a</font>

26
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,629
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who really really need to</font>

27

get abroad add a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who are</font>

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,930
stuck aboard you really really need to

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,670
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back but generally I've actually</font>

30
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,069
been quite enjoying having absolutely no

31
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,600
planes in the sky so we're quite near

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,790
the flight path where I live and just

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,220
and everyone just going outside and

34
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,530

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,500
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone will go a little bit</font>

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,750
more local reduce the carbon footprint a

40
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,159
little bit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> events</font>

about books because i haven't really

50
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,490

leading a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of books on rereading</font>

54

got two exams coming up after this

56

<font color="#CCCCCC">manifesto and a Room of One's Own as</font>

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,930
well as too many articles and foucault

59
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,720
and stuff like that

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,250
that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really understand and</font>

61
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,110
needs a lot concentration so aside from

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">shantaram haven't really done that much</font>

great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the character of time if</font>

that they I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually read very</font>

71
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,290
often and a non stereotype in a

72
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,730
stereotypical way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it's</font>

73
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrible way to explain it so</font>

74
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,790
there we go i enjoyed this a lot so you

75
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,100

the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read which I also really</font>

82
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,490
loved it's the second in Maureen Johnson

83
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,760
series of books about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scarlett who lives</font>

84
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,750
in a hotel and her shenanigans in New

85
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,060
York as just everything frequently

86
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,800
things to go from the air for her but I

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,180
really enjoyed this it's always really

88
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,550
funny and more adults is just such a

89
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,680
great writer nothing I did look at today

90
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,350
on my lunch break was booked something

91
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,820
like I tell you I love you but I'd have

92
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kill you I think it's called by a bee</font>

93
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,450
Carter and it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

94
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,280
reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me took me back to being 12 and</font>

95
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,430
13 and 8 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being obsessed with</font>

96
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,410
books about kind of spies and spying so

97
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,239
I loved Harriet the Spy I loved the

98
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,100
mystery of cloud the mystery kids those

99
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,000
books kind of leading on from all their

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,320
adventure books like famous five but I

101
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,700
went through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real phase and I</font>

102
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,040
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through an agent angel</font>

103
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,040
face with them the books<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Mel baby</font>

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
who died when she was 12 and became a

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,730
spy in heaven<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was just a such</font>

106
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,500
good serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> em so it was really nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

107
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,269
kind of read something quite indulgent I

108
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,450
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that they are the greatest</font>

109
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,459
works of literature in the world but it

110
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:05,709
was nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that was a bit</font>

111
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,540
easy easy to remove not in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad way</font>

112
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,700
like easiest doesn't have to be a bad

113
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,650
thing there's nothing wrong with reading

114
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,930
book and finding it easy problem with

115
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,120
reading so many books set in the states

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,728
to have done throughout my entire life

117
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:20,820
balanced quite

118
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,160
easily with a diet of royal darlin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enid</font>

119
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Blyton sometimes when I'm falling asleep</font>

120
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,870
my internal dialogue that a little thing

121
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't shut up about stressing about</font>

122
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,010
things and writing things down come up

123
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,660
with new ideas and new characters and I

124
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,730
don't know what did I forget to do today

125
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what should i do tomorrow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

126
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,320
internal dialogue sometimes has an

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,060
American accent and I can't do an

128
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,070
American accent so it's a bad American

129
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,170
accent and it can drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> that warm little</font>

130
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,620
bit but<font color="#CCCCCC"> M here we go kind of a big thing</font>
