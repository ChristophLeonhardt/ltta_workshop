thanks for joining us hi Amelia petrenko with your latest news in the world of social media Facebook and Twitter have gotten rid of suspicious accounts spewing fakes and propaganda from Iran the troll factories not only after the minds of the Americans but users all over the world it's claimed to be run by Iran's government media not positive by n my couch Arase bottoms read Facebook already enables users to check if they've been exposed to Russian BOTS and trolls how many trolls does it take to incite a revolution scores of so-called Russian BOTS took over Twitter and Facebook some stories never seem to die well this Facebook / Twitter online police rate is an actual news story this week yeah you can take plenty of the earlier reports replace the word Russia with Iran and get pretty much identical stuff alright speaking of Facebook this time it banned 625 pages traced to Iran and an unknown number of pages linked to Russia it just wouldn't work if Russia didn't get mentioned and the reason for this verdict is we removed multiple pages groups and accounts for coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook and Instagram what kind of sin is this inauthentic behavior let's hear from sucks people they use similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing we ban this kind of behavior because we want people to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook the issue of trusting what pops out at you from the internet it's almost as old as I am Oscar where we should meet it seems like you're chatting with somebody just like yourself not always even if they show a picture of themselves it may not really be who they say they are it could be somebody dangerous I'm not trying to say criminals who take advantage of online platforms shouldn't the banned or prosecuted but dear Facebook the way the Internet and social networks have worked for years is that users can be who they want to be online who said they must stick to what someone thinks is authentic behavior what if I want to be an elf or Santa or a real news hound am I now gonna be blamed for inauthentic behavior and get a red card sooner or later a whole virtual universe people come to the Oasis for all the things they can do but they stay because of all the things they can beat well it looks like online platforms will force us to adjust to a new reality we're a step away from your genuine behavior may lead to a ban or some distinguished fact checkers will tell you who you should or shouldn't trust how's this for a policy update Facebook's just announced it will assess how good or how bad their users are at flagging fake news we developed a process to protect against people indiscriminately flagging news as fake and attempting to game the system the reason we do this is to make sure that our fight against misinformation is as effective as possible I think it's political pressure I think it really comes down to that they are putting themselves in the position of mediating human relationships which is first of all a very unhealthy thing to do and it's something that they really are grossly incompetent to do and users primarily will not know what is being done to them and they will be manipulated in all sorts of ways we don't know what kind of ways so next time when he choose to complain about a post online think twice what if the fact checkers disagree in fact whatever you do there better think twice alia petrenko well statistics are suggesting meanwhile the social media site might be losing some of its sparkle according to a ranking service the amount of time visitors spent on the platform is down 10 percent this month it also reveals that visitor interest is slipping Facebook are yet to respond to a request for comment on this you
