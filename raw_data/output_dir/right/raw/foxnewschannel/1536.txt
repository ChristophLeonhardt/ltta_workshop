00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:10,170
PELOSI AND THE GROUP, YOU HEARD

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,304
HERE THE OTHER DAY.

6
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,740
SHE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,276
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE TAX

8
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:20,180
CUT BILL AND RAZE -- RAISE YOUR

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,580
TAXES.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,115
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK THAT PLAYS

11
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:22,415
WELL.

12
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:23,950
YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT.

13
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,352
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES.

14
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:27,254
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T

15
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,322
BELIEVE IN BORDERS, DON'T

16
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:31,591
BELIEVE IN FIGHTING CRIME, DON'T

17
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:36,029
BELIEVE IN MAKING A STRONG

18
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:36,463
MILITARY.

19
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:39,132
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT THE

20
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:41,067
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM BELIEVE.

21
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,036
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.

22
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:45,505
SO WE HAVE TO DO A GREAT JOB.

23
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:49,176
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT AT THE

00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:50,677
SUSAN B. ANTHONY DINNER TONIGHT

WARNING US ABOUT WHAT IS TO COME

26
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,247
IF NANCY PELOSI AND THE

27
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:56,917
DEMOCRATS OVER TOOK OVER

00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:58,118
CONGRESS, DESPITE REPUBLICANS

29
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,053
LEADING IN A GENERIC BALLOT POLL

30
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,321
AGAINST THE DEMOCRATS.

31
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,823
CONGRESSMAN AL GREEN IS EXPOSING

32
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:04,825
THE LEFT'S PLAN IF THEY TAKE A

33
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:05,191
MAJORITY.

34
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,059
YOU'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

35
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:07,160
THEY'RE TRYING TO BE A LITTLE

36
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,128
MORE QUIET ABOUT IT.

37
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:09,429
BUT THIS IS THEIR PLAN.

38
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:11,898
BELIEVE IT.

39
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,034
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE WILL

40
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,836
BE MEMBERS WHO ARE GOING TO WAIT

41
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:19,472
FOR SOMEONE ELSE IF THAT SOMEONE

42
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:20,607
ELSE, DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT IS,

43
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:21,641
IS DECLINING TO DO IT.

44
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:23,043
WE CAN ALL DO IT.

45
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:25,412
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A GOOD

46
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:26,513
LIKELIHOOD THERE WILL BE

47
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:28,849
ARTICLES OF I IMPEACHMENT.

48
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:32,752
>> Sean: HERE WITH REACTION,

00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,387
SEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER SECRET

50
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:37,023
SERVICE OFFICER, DAN BONGINO.

51
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:39,492
DAN, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE,

52
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:41,828
NANCY WILL GIVE IN -- PELOSI

53
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:44,130
WILL GIVE IN TO HER LEFT-WING

54
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,431
BASE.

55
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:45,832
THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES AND

56
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:47,400
BASICALLY WOULD LIKE TO STOP

57
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,835
THIS PRESIDENT'S SUCCESSFUL

58
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:49,169
AGENDA.

59
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,937
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY WILL GO

60
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:52,839
FOR IMPEACHMENT REGARDLESS.

61
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,574
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE.

62
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,443
>> SEAN, YOU UNDERSTAND, THEY

63
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:58,011
HAVE NOTHING ELSE, RIGHT.

64
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:02,616
THIS IS A BROKEN, DESTRUCTIVE,

65
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:03,984
DISTURBING SHELL OF A PARTY THAT

66
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,053
IS DROWNING IN IDENTITY POLITICS

67
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,922
AND RAGE AT DONALD TRUMP; THAT

68
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,324
IS MANIFESTING ITSELF THROUGHOUT

69
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:13,226
OUTRAGEOUS CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT

70
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:14,427
FOR FAIRYTALE COLLUSION CHARGES

71
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:15,962
NO ONE CAN PROVIDE ANY EVIDENCE

72
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:16,897
OF.

73
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:19,866
SEAN, YOU CAN'T WIN A DEMOCRAT

74
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,568
PRIMARY IN THESE RADICAL

75
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,703
FAR-LEFT CONGRESS DISTRICTS IF

76
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,472
YOU DON'T GO, YOU KNOW, FULL

77
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,907
PSYCHOPATH AND START CALLING FOR

78
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:28,408
THE IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD TRUMP.

79
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:30,610
I MEAN, THEY DON'T STAND FOR IT

80
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,311
ANY MORE.

81
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:33,079
THE PARTY IS COMPLETELY BROKEN.

82
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,917
>> Sean: THAT'S THE POINT.

83
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:41,054
Dr. GORKA, JUST DON'T SAY IT.

84
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:41,354
SHH.

85
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:42,422
LET'S KEEP IT QUIET.

86
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:43,490
LET'S NOT BE HONEST WITH THE

87
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,324
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

88
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:45,892
THEY ARE HONEST ABOUT, YEAH,

89
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:47,961
WE'RE RUNNING ON THE PLATFORM,

90
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:51,798
LET'S RAISE EVERYBODY'S TAXES

91
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:52,232
DRAMATICALLY.

92
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,634
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS GOING TO

93
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:54,935
WORK.

94
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:56,836
>> WHAT ELSE DO THEY HAVE, SEAN,

95
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:57,470
LITERALLY.

96
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,005
WE WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES.

97
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,740
WHAT ELSE COULD THEY DO?

98
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,943
WE WANT TO, WHAT, BRING BACK

99
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:03,710
ISIS?

100
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,046
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

101
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:06,846
WALL ISN'T BUILT.

102
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:09,616
WE WANT THE ECONOMY TO TANK.

103
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:10,684
WE DON'T WANT FIVE MILLION

104
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:14,220
PEOPLE TO BE GIVEN CASH BONUSES

105
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,655
BECAUSE OF THE TAX REFORM.

106
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,958
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO RUN ON.

107
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,460
BUT, SEAN, 2018 IS EVEN MORE

108
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,695
IMPORTANT THAN 2016 BECAUSE IF

109
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,964
THEY GET THE MAJORITY, THEY WILL

110
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,799
BEGIN IMPEACHMENT AND ALL THE

111
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:26,733
INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT THE

112
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,935
PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN JUST 15

113
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,403
MONTHS WILL BE STOPPED.

114
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:32,038
THEY WILL BE OBSTRUCTED FOR THE

115
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:34,107
NEXT SEVEN YEARS.

116
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:37,377
SO 2016 WAS AN ACT OF GOD, YES,

117
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:37,777
ABSOLUTELY.

118
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,913
BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

119
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:43,049
THE FLOTILLA COMES UP BEHIND

120
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,551
THIS ICEBREAKER WHO IS DONALD

121
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:46,920
TRUMP AND MAKE SURE THE MAKE

122
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,421
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGENDA IS

123
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,656
IMPLEMENTED FOR THE NEXT SEVEN

124
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:49,990
YEARS.

125
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,758
>> Sean: THINK ABOUT THIS, IN

126
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:54,861
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY, A 17-POINT

127
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,030
DEMOCRATIC ADVANTAGE, GENERIC

128
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,497
BALLOT, DAN.

129
00:03:57,497 --> 00:04:00,400
NOW IT'S A SIX-POINT REPUBLICAN

130
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,934
ADVANTAGE.

131
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,435
I THINK IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S

132
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:04,337
SUCCESS THAT'S TURNED THIS ALL

133
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:04,671
AROUND.

134
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:06,373
>> SEAN, PEOPLE VOTE KITCHEN

135
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:08,274
TABLE ISSUES, THE FAPTNESS OF

136
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,810
THEIR WALLET, YOU KNOW, NOT THE

137
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,278
FATNESS OF FAKE RUSSIAN

138
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:13,146
COLLUSION CHARGES THEY'VE WASTED

139
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:14,180
ALL THIS TIME ON.

140
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,215
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LEARNED

141
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,384
NOTHING FROM THE IMPEACHMENT OF

142
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:18,151
BILL CLINTON AND HIS SUBSEQUENT

143
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,552
WIN IN THE SENATE THERE IN THAT

144
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,220
THAT TRIAL.

145
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,286
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT

146
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,990
THE RESULTS OF A FAIR AND SOUND

147
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,525
ELECTION OVERTURNED BY A BUNCH

148
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,227
OF POLITICIANS UP ON CAPITOL

149
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,361
HILL.

150
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,330
THIS IS A TACTICALLY RIDICULOUS

151
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,465
MOVE THAT IS GOING TO -- THE

152
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,034
BLOW BACKWILL BE SUBSTANTIAL IF

153
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:34,768
THEY DO THIS.

154
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:36,536
>> Sean: DOCTOR, WHAT IS YOUR

155
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:36,903
TAKE?

156
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,072
LOOK, I'VE BEEN SAYING, AND I'VE

157
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,774
REALLY -- I HAVE A LOT OF PLANS

158
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:41,841
FOR THIS AUDIENCE COMING UP IN

159
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,610
THE DAYS, WEEKS AND MONTHS

160
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:43,943
AHEAD.

161
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:47,580
DON'T WANT TO REVEAL MY PLANS.

162
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,149
A LOT OF COPYCATS AND UNCREATIVE

163
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,517
PEOPLE IN TELEVISION AND RADIO.

164
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,852
HERE'S MY POINT, THIS WILL BE A

165
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:55,188
DEFINING, HISTORIC MOMENT, THIS

166
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:56,556
MIDTERM ELECTION, THE MOST

167
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:57,991
IMPORTANT MIDTERM PERHAPS IN

168
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:59,392
AMERICAN HISTORY.

169
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,660
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE

170
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,562
ABOUT AN ELECTION TO DESTROY

171
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,229
THIS PRESIDENT.

172
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,032
THAT IS ALL THEY HAVE, THAT AND

173
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,801
RAISING TAXES AND GUTTING OUR

174
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:08,168
MILITARY.

175
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:08,735
THAT'S IT.

176
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,837
THAT'S WHAT THEY STAND FOR, BUT

177
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:12,572
THEY WON'T EVEN BE HONEST WITH

178
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,675
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THAT

179
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:16,009
AGENDA.

180
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,844
>> OBAMA ADMITTED, SEAN, HE

181
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:19,979
WANTS TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE

182
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:20,346
AMERICA.

183
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:21,581
YOU DON'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE

184
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:22,649
SOMETHING YOU LOVE.

185
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,583
THIS IS OUR WINDOW.

186
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,818
THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY.

187
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,686
THERE'S A VERY SMALL WINDOW NOW

188
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:29,689
TO BRING IT ALL BACK, TO BRING

189
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,925
BACK THE REPUBLIC, THE STAKES

190
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,426
COULD NOT BE HIGHER.

191
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:34,794
THEY WANT TO DIVIDE US.

192
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,729
THEY WANT TO UNDERMINE US.

193
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,765
IT IS ONLY THE MIDTERMS THAT'S

194
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:39,799
GOING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO

195
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,135
SAVE THE REPUBLIC.

196
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,636
IT'S SIMPLY THAT MASSIVE A STAKE

197
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:44,037
RIGHT NOW.

198
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,705
>> Sean: DAN, AND YOU AGREE?

199
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,440
>> YEAH, I AGREE.

200
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,741
THEY'VE LEARNED NOTHING, THE

201
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,510
DEMOCRATS, FROM THEIR LOSS IN

202
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,911
WISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA AND

203
00:05:51,911 --> 00:00:00,000
NEARLY IN MINNESOTA AS WELL.
