government have decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all drugs</font>

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,660
are bad and thus are trying to ban

everything that makes your<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain do</font>

stuff that it wouldn't otherwise do this

their lovely lovely friends these legal

highs are legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> because these evil</font>

16

scientists go in and change a small

17

parts of the chemical code so that

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,120
technically it's a different substance

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,160
to the more traditional ecstasy cocaine

potentially harmful drugs importantly

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,580
the bill will exclude Alcohol Tobacco

32

food medical products and caffeine so

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,689
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about not</font>

34
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,740
having my morning brew one could argue

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the government and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who</font>

support this bill have a right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

37
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,630
worried because these legal substances

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,299
do sometimes kill people deaths caused

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,540
by legal highs went from 12 in 2009 to

40
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,750
97 in 2012 now I really do think this is

41
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">a fantastic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 people</font>

it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just choose to ban any</font>

77

78

the fact they do brain things me thinks

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is probably pandering to the</font>

84

evening that's the wine will you there

89
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,470
was actually really interesting response

90
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,060
to the spread of the use of legal highs

91
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,579
in New Zealand recently where a couple

92
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of years back they went to the evil mad</font>

93
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,870
scientists who are changing the chemical

94
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,549
code of all of these drugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying</font>

all right you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think your substances fit</font>

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,750
for human consumption well then prove it

my was that Australian I'm not sure if

98
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,739
that was Australian New Zealand was

99
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,660
getting the creators of these synthetic

drugs to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their products were</font>

101

103
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,989
causing death or mental damage then it

104
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,030
too would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be banned but if not you'd</font>

priority

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,560
is despite all of this the UK government

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,590
seems set on setting the default setting

118
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,870

backwards and all the while tobacco
