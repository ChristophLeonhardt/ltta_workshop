the army if you're watching this give it a share because there has to be the public have to show their support on that on an issue like this so that these young lads don't get left hung out to dry now I was at motorway services I saw a load of young men who are in the army I had my fight I'd taken with them that photo was shared online I've just found out that those young men are being investigated they've all had their phones taken off them by the arm they've seized all of their phones none of them can now contact their their families their families don't know what's going on they just know that they've had their phone ceased phone seized by the army for what for having your photo taken with someone we have in your photo taken with someone now a Muslim organization the Muslim Council of Britain have made the big song and dance about this the army of give a statement in response to the Muslim Council of Britain the second-in-command of the Muslim Council of Britain signed a declaration saying that our armed forces are legitimate targets for suicide bombings that's who currently our army leaders are pandering to the Muslim Council of Britain yes we have a Muslim Council of Britain no joke okay now where the Muslim Council of Britain this vocal went four times as many British Muslims went to fight for Isis then joined our armed services these young men who have been neglected they are predominantly white working-class they've been forgotten and neglected undereducated and failed in our country and they've joined the military many of them because there's no other choice they've joined the military and you want them to sacrifice their lives you want them to go away to faraway fields fight and die to install freedom in other countries whilst you take their freedom away from them motorway services of the M bloody one they've had a photo taken I have never ever the same far-right figures I've never been charged with or arrested for any racial or religious extremism ever in my life they are all false tags put on me by media and government I've never so how can you try and discipline not just discipline but take their phones and investigate them investigate these young men for having a photo taken for expressing their own freedom they have a freedom to choose who they want is there a list of people now there are armed services have a list of who you can and can't have your photo taken with is that what's happening now in Britain what an absolute joke it's bad enough that we have military the military personnel recruitment videos shows show Muslim soldiers taking their boots off and getting down and praying in the middle of a battlefield why our soldiers say hold on a minute that's what someone's praying are you for real are you for real yeah and you've gone that politically correct there was a photograph shared the other day by the British military saying we're having a weekend personnel away day for all the Imams in Britain all the Imams the Imams who believe that homosexuals should be punished for adult with should be punished with death the Imams we believe women are second-class citizens all of these Imams and your if someone has a photo taken with Jeremy Corbyn would there be this investigation Jeremy Corbyn who has said Hamas Hamas or a proscribed terrorist organization if you're watching this share it and if you

public feeling if you think if you think you're gonna be able to just hang these poison I just can't believe that I was gonna do this when I got home but I can't it's ridiculous it's ridiculous those young men and I said to them I didn't want to go I won't want to get you in trouble by sharing the photo and I said for what for I tell you what for because it's 2018 and political correctness is so embedded in every area of our country even the army even the army but it takes one minute it will take you one minute you see if everyone shared this and shared it everywhere one minute sign that petition and I'll personally hand it in to the army and not just and follow this because you can see all these organizations you can see a more comment in now they're all silent about how many Muslims

they've done something criminally wrong a photograph a photograph of an individual and you're investigating them taking their phone seizing their phones but keep monitoring this if you and as I said follow the website I'll put the updates on that website the updates continue going on that website just um it's absolutely unbelievable it's a far man and if you like you know if you look at the most recent army recruitment videos look at all the army recruitment videos yeah it's all about it's okay to cry in the army yeah it's okay if you want to cry it's okay and then it's got someone else saying it's got another the recruitment video it's got another man saying when I yes it was okay for me to have my boyfriend in the army oh I didn't realize it why are you making a deal of all these issues there's always been gaming in the army there's always been gaming in the army why do I now assist it's just been shoved in everyone's faces all of these issues all of these issues which don't need to be they don't need to be and now with the whole the group fruit mint drive to fill of army man but anyway one other thing well some on a live stream when there's ten thousand people watching I want to say that when I come out of custody it's embarrassing enough when I come out of custody I wasn't in a great place I then took time now to prepare myself for probably going back to prison in two weeks that's where need slant petition so I can hand him before I go back but um and I want to say thank you to all the people who signed up on my website there give me the ability and the time to take a back seat have some time my family but also to plan for I want to do after after my court case I'm sort of lying in limbo land at the minute where I'm just waiting to go back to prison for absolutely for nonsense for free speech again for telling facts that are already in the public domain there when sending back to prison for it so I also found out if warm on that subject Levi's bellingfield remember the murderer who was a bouncer he was a bouncer he was a murderer he murdered a young girl when he was on his court trial the Daily Mirror one of the newspapers which has been hammering me for my contempt of court charge were the Daily Mirror breach breach the restriction and Prejudice control they Prejudice trial so much that the jury had to be disbanded and the case collapsed yeah and then had to start a whole new trial ten thousand pound fine they got they got ten thousand pound fine never in 70 years as any journalist ever been sent a prison or prosecuted in any way but yet they want I'm back and I'm back on trial in two weeks and this is all plays in to the reason why these young men are being targeted by their bosses within the army for having a photo political correctness and an attempt to shut everyone up and silence everyone in anyone who dares show any opposition to Islam in Britain that's it that's what's happened so that's yeah I'm having a run I'm having a mid run I was sick yeah yeah not bad me standing in Bexley High Street having my rant about how unbelievable is the current situation of our country and general I sense and this is so that people feel they're not alone because I know I'm not alone because everywhere I go I get an amazing reception the sames reception I got of those young Armed Forces like everywhere I go so I'm fully aware that the British public are feeling these feelings they're feeling oppressed Fe in silence they feel being shut down no one can speak no one can do anything without being attacked and slandered and imprisoned or sacked losing your job where the young go this week 17 years old kicked out of her colleagues house for saying that she admired Tommy Robinson so what so what she did what happened to freedoms in an education system that is absolutely it was all right for everyone else to support Jeremy Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn who attends terrorist funerals who says Hamas who are a proscribed terrorist organisation or his friends that's all fine because it fits the far-left agenda fix the far-left anti-semitic communist and Marxist agenda but as soon as you express or position 20 of these things or position two gangs of Muslim men raping young girls or position two terrorists walking our streets or positions or any any of this I've gone on the run in or I've gone off on one but yeah that's it so I want to say thank you to everyone who's been doing that and please sign that petition and make sure that even if you don't like mate everyone has to make sure that these boys ain't left out on their own on this that the British Army are fully aware of the public feeling about this that our soldiers are allowed if they want to take a photo with whoever the hell that however the hell they want to take a photo with none of them made political statements at all none of them share it and a stop ran it now go get I am a Mars way see you later and if anyone's watching this who's it if there's any other family members from those young lads or any other lads that I'll keep completely confidential or I won't say a word this users contacting me keep me up to date with what the you're doing on this because we just simply simply as a nation we cannot allow young men to be treated like this by our by our military you can't just cuz I got you yeah you put me in uniform you send them off to fight and then you want to take everyone their own freedoms away it can't be allowed you
