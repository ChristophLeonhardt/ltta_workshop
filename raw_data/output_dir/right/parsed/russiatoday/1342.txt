rusher should be in this meeting why are
we having a meeting without Russia being
in the meeting and I would recommend and
it's up to them but Russia should be in
the meeting it should be a part of it
you know whether you like it or not
and it may not be politically correct
but we have a world to run and in the g7
which used to be the g8 they through
Russia out they should let Russian come
back in because we should have Russia at
the negotiating table
