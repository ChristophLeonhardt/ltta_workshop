I'm sorry where's Sean he's here to that
this is part of my job as well did you
guys ever ask any of the other deputy
press secretary to making syndication
out yeah all right okay in a new
position now or you just I mean he is
taking on a little bit of extra duty at
this point so I think it's very little
changed it's probably upgraded at this
point given that we don't have a
communication striker here and I don't
have to say that at all you can get one
day April there are a lot of demands on
his schedule particularly given the fact
that there's not a communications
director and this is part of my job as
well and when I'm needed I'll step in
