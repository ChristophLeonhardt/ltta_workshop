LINDSEY GREW

00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:09,162
LINDSEY GRAW

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:12,532
>>> WE ARE BACK WITH SENATOR

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:12,966
LINDSEY GRAHAM.

5
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:20,240
YOU SAID IF I BECOME COMMITTEE

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:28,148
LEAD YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS.

7
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:30,217
>> MOST LIBERAL MEDIA OUTLETS

8
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:32,351
BELIEVE THIS IS A NOTABLE CAUSE.

9
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,054
THAT I WON'T GIVE MUCH THOUSAND

10
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,589
E-MAILS THOSE WHO TRY TO TAKE

11
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:36,857
KAVANAUGH DOWN.

12
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:39,693
THIS CAN BE PLAID OUT OVERTIME

13
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,428
AND DESTROY THE ABILITY TO GET

14
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:43,430
GOOD PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,633
I'LL FIND OUT WHAT STAFFER

16
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:49,069
RECOMMENDED CATS TO BE FORDS

17
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,403
LAWYER.

18
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:52,273
WHY THEY DIDN'T TELL HER ABOUT

19
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:54,875
THE ALLEGATION AND IF SHE NEEDED

20
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,243
A LAWYER.

21
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:58,646
SHE WAS URGED BY DEMOCRATIC

22
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,314
SENATORS TO GIVE AN INTERVIEW.

23
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:03,150
IF THEY BELIEVE SHE HAD

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,152
SOMETHING SERIOUS TO SAY THEY

25
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,488
SHOULD HAVE SENT IT TO THE

26
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:12,493
COMMITTEE AND NOT THE MEDIA.

27
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:14,361
I'LL FIND OUT WHO LEAKED THE

28
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,397
LETTER PROVIDED BY COREY

29
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:18,532
GARDINER AND PUNISH THEM.

30
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:21,735
WE CAN'T LET THOSE PEOPLE WHO

31
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:24,338
BETRAYED DR.  FORD'S TRUST GET

32
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:25,105
AWAY WITH IT.

33
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,541
>>Reporter: SHOULD WE TRUST

34
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,645
THE FBI HERE?

35
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:34,748
AFTER ALL WE --

36
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:35,316
>> YES.

37
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,518
>> AND PUT THEIR FINGER ON THE

38
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:38,085
SCALE.

39
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:41,989
WHAT'S YOUR TRUSTWORTHINESS OF

40
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,358
THE FBI AND WILL IT TAKE A WEEK?

41
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:46,227
>> IT SHOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS.

42
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,562
THE TRUST LEVEL IS HIGH.

43
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:50,431
MY BEEF HAS NEVER BEEN WITH THE

44
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:53,300
FBI BUT MCCABE AND A FEW BAD

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,734
APPLES.

46
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,369
I LOVE THE FBI.

47
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,037
PROFESSIONAL AGENTS THAT DO

48
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:57,972
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

49
00:01:57,972 --> 00:02:00,441
THEY WILL TALK TO THOSE DR.

50
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:01,208
FORD NAMED.

51
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,412
THEY WILL TAKE TO MS. RAMIREZ

52
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:07,882
WHO WE FUSED TO TALK TO THE

53
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:08,249
COMMITTEE.

54
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:09,449
THAT WILL BE IT.

55
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,453
I TRUST THEY WILL DO A FAIR

56
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:14,188
BACKGROUND CHECK AND EVERYBODY

57
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,224
WHO IS LISTENING, WE WON'T LET

58
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,626
THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS.

59
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,863
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL NO ONE

60
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:25,867
WILL COME FORWARD.

61
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,036
IT'S OFOUS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING

62
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:28,403
TO DO.

63
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:30,705
THEY ARE TRYING TO DELAY

64
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:31,639
KAVANAUGH.

65
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,842
>> REALLY QUICK BEFORE YOU GO,

66
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:38,846
SENATOR, WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT?

67
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,381
>> A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER

68
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:51,859
OR NOT ROSENSTEIN WAS PART OF A

69
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,127
KOUE TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

70
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:55,696
I WOULDN'T FIRE HIM UNLESS THERE

71
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,999
IS REAL CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT

72
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,068
HE DID SOMETHING IMPROPER.

73
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,736
>> IF THE HOUSE FLIPS WE WON'T

74
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:04,038
HEAR ABOUT THAT STORY ANY

75
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:04,572
LONGER.

76
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:05,907
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

IF I RECOMMENDED A CONSERVATIVE

81
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,020
ACTIVIST LAWYER.
