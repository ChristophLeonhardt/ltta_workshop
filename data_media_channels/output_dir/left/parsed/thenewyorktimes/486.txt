I'm Thomas Fuller, and I need cash.
I've reported here in Myanmar dozens
of times, and know that converting
to kyat the local currency,
can be a journey in itself.
This one you can't change?
>> No change.
>> You can't change this for me?
>> No.
>> The problem with this bill
appears to be this little tear.
In the top.
They weren't as bothered
with the writing, but
there's also a crease in the bill.
>> Basically,
the bills need to look brand new.
And in Myanmar, they take that
requirement very literally.
If you can't get your hands
on these kinds of bills,
you could be in trouble.
>> This one is new, perfect.
But because it was
folded they said no.
>> Yes.
>> Seven pounds  jacket.
>> When I left Australia I
bought perfect $100 bills.
But when I went to the bank they
refused to take it because it had
a tiny little fold on the corner.
>> After I gave them
my perfect money,
they gave me back a wadded up brown
piece of money I couldn't even read.
It looked like they got it off
the floor or out of the trash or
something.
It was.
I didn't even really wanna touch it.
>> A bit of a double standard.
But as Myanmar struggles
to join the global economy,
I think the fussiness may
hinder more than help.
Ask whose media company
generates a lot of cash.
>> We have 18 people just
to count the cash, go and
pick up cash, go and
pay cash to someone somewhere.
In our previous office building,
which was not open like this,
it was a closed room,
all this mold, fungus,
odor, that was just coming out,
just was making them sick.
So we had to put in super powerful
exhaust fans, move them into
a bigger room so that there
wouldn't be this congested smell,
dampening the whole room.
>> Right.
>> This is the smell of money.
>> Smell of money.
Yes.
>> So why do the Burmese care so
much about perfect bills.
I tried calling the central bank,
but
they said no one could
answer our questions.
I wonder if Uton Lewin,
the deputy chairman of Myanmar's
largest commercial bank has an idea.
>> When we ship this
currency abroad,
to deposit at these foreign banks,
particularly in Singapore.
They always examine,
and sometimes it's oh no you're
this poor, you need to discern.
We won't give you the 100% now.
So it's not an American bank,
because we under sanction.
So the government banks said oh,
we can only accept buffet bill,
buffet bill.
No more, because otherwise
we are going to lose.
>> Okay, but I still need a place
to exchange my dirty money.
At this point, it seems like
Bogyoke Market is my best bet.
It's a rabbit warren of
checkers games, tea stalls, and
money changers.
Someone might be willing
to take a chance.
>> No change.
>> You can't change this for me?
Because of the rip.
Oh.
Strike one.
This one you can't change?
Strike two.
Oh, well, nevermind.
Okay.
Finally, someone bites.
>> That's a different rate for
smaller notes.
So I give you new notes and
you give me.
It's like stained with blood or
something.
Thanks.
Back in Bogyoke Market, a freelance
money exchanger approaches me to
take the last of my cash.
What do you got?
What's your rate?
>> 1,050.
>> So it's about a 15%-
>> Yeah.
>> Cut that I have to take.
>> Yeah.
I give you.
>> Because, but why,
what's the problem?
>> This is not right.
>> It's the writing on this bill.
>> Yeah.
>> So I gave you that bill, so
these bills are kind of old?
>> But no problem!
>> No problem, right.
>>  no problem!
Okay, this one is ripped here.
That's okay?
>> 
no problem.
>> All right, thanks.
It's a bum deal but
at this point, I'll take it.
So there you have it.
If you're traveling to Myanmar make
sure to bring along a pristine stack
of US dollar bills.
Tell us what you think about it.
We'd love to see your comments.
There's also an underground
market for chat notes.
Freshly minted,
which you can obtain for a price.
Follow the link to that story.
There's also a New York Times
investigation into the heroin
heartland in Myanmar.
Opium country in
Southern Shan State.
There's a link for that, too.
