1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:01,528
MR. TRUMP IN ON ANYTHING UNTIL

2
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:02,729
HE WAS ELECTED, THEN THEY

3
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:04,264
DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD KNOW

4
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:04,931
ABOUT THE DOSSIER BECAUSE IT

5
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:16,943
WOULD BE DANGEROUS IF HE DIDN'T.

6
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:20,313
IS COMING UNDER FIRE BY SEVERAL

7
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:21,415
DEMOCRATS FOR CRITICIZING THE

8
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:22,015
MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

9
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:26,720
HE WROTE AN OP-ED THIS WEEK

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,354
ENTITLED "STOPPING ROBERT

11
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:29,523
MUELLER TO PROTECT US ALL."

12
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:33,960
HE SAID THIS WHOLE THING WAS

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,562
BORN OUT OF QUOTE HYSTERIA.

14
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:37,297
AND NOW, NBC'S JOE SCARBOROUGH

15
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:40,767
IS VERY FIRED UP AND ANGRY ABOUT

16
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,169
THAT AND QUESTIONING MR. PENN'S

17
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:42,536
INTEGRITY.

18
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:44,938
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS MARK PENN

19
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:45,739
SELLING?

20
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:46,873
DOES HE HAVE A FOX NEWS

21
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:47,541
CONTRACT?

22
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,677
IS HE WRITING FOR A CONSERVATIVE

23
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:52,345
WEBSITE?

24
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,314
I WANT TO KNOW, OFTEN IN

25
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:55,315
WASHINGTON, D.C., WHEN PEOPLE DO

26
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,317
STRANGE THINGS LIKE THIS,

27
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,119
CREATURES OF THE SWAMP, THEY ARE

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,287
DOING IT FOR A REASON.

29
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:02,589
>> Martha: HERE NOW TO DEFEND

30
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:03,723
HIMSELF IS MARK PENN.

31
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:05,358
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

32
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:06,993
ARE YOU GETTING PAID BY

33
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:07,360
FOX NEWS?

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,329
NOT THAT THAT'S A BAD THING,

35
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:11,098
LOTS OF UPSTANDING INDIVIDUALS

36
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:12,732
GET PAID BY FOX NEWS.

37
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:14,367
ARE YOU UNDER CONTRACT?

38
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,337
>> IT WAS A TAX ON ME WHEN I WAS

39
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:20,540
IN POLITICAL LIGHT, HAVING A FOX

40
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,108
CONTRACT.

41
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:24,177
NO, I'M NOT BEING PAID BY FOX IN

42
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:24,711
ANY WAY.

43
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:29,816
>> Martha: SO JOE SCARBOROUGH,

44
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:31,084
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU

45
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:35,622
WORKED WITH ON THE CLINTON

46
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:36,323
CAMPAIGN.

47
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:37,090
THEY THINK THEY'RE SOMETHING

48
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,728
WRONG WITH YOU.

49
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,598
SPEAK OUT THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOT

50
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:46,133
THERE IN 98.

51
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:46,833
WHERE THERE WHITE HOUSE WAS

52
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,368
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AT PEOPLE'S

53
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:50,904
LIVES WERE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN,

54
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:52,939
AND MY INTEREST HERE WAS A GOOD

55
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,542
GOVERNMENT AND BETTER POLITICS.

56
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:56,343
TAKING THE CRIMINALIZATION

57
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:58,745
UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE THE

58
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,046
FIRMEST OF EVIDENCE, WHICH

59
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:00,714
CERTAINLY THIS INVESTIGATION

60
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:02,482
DIDN'T HAVE.

61
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,151
I THINK IT'S ONLY REASONABLE TO

62
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:04,818
START TO QUESTION THIS

63
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,353
INVESTIGATION AFTER YOU LOOK AT

64
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:07,754
THE STRUCK PAGE TEXT.

65
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,556
I MEAN, THAT ALONE BLEW THIS

66
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:11,525
THING OPEN.

67
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:13,760
ONCE THIS REPORT COMES FROM THE

68
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,327
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL --

69
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,730
>> Martha: BUT THEY ALSO SAY,

70
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,531
BIG DEAL.

71
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,132
THEY CRITICIZED THE PRESIDENT.

72
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:20,133
THEY CANNOT LIKE THE PRESIDENT

73
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,735
AND STILL DO THEIR JOB.

74
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:25,505
>> THAT INSURANCE INSURANCE

75
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:26,473
POLICY REALLY SUGGESTED

76
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:27,741
SOMETHING ELSE WAS GOING ON.

77
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:28,808
NOW YOU HAVE THE INVESTIGATION

78
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:33,280
GOING ON BY THE IGS OF THE DOJ.

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,915
THAT COULD BLOW THE WHOLE THING

80
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:35,749
WIDE OPEN.

81
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:36,850
NOW IF THAT REPORT IS SOFT, I

82
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,718
COULD TAKE BACK SOME OF MY

83
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:39,085
OPINIONS.

84
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,988
BUT MY OPINIONS ARE BASED ON THE

85
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,290
EXPERIENCE I HAVE AND A FAIR

86
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,990
READING OF THE EVIDENCE THAT'S

87
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,894
COME OUT HERE WHICH RAISES THE

88
00:02:47,894 --> 00:02:48,929
QUESTIONS, WHEN DID IT GET

89
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,931
STARTED, HOW DID THEY CREATE THE

90
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,899
POWERS TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT

91
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:54,134
WITHIN A GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT

92
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,336
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE

93
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,070
ATTORNEY GENERAL, CONGRESS OR

94
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,738
THE PRESIDENT?

95
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:00,340
>> Martha: THE MUELLER REPORT

96
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,709
IS NOT OUT YET, THE IG REPORT IS

97
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,312
NOT OUT YET, AND CONCLUSIONS

98
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:06,913
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DRAWN.

99
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:08,915
THEY KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS,

100
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,884
THEY DECIDED WHAT THE OUTCOME IS

101
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:16,823
ON THIS, AND THE PROBLEM WITH

102
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,626
MARK PENN SPOUTING THIS STUFF IS

103
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:22,329
THAT SOME DEMOCRAT WILL LOOK AT

104
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,966
HIM AND SAY, HE'S A DEMOCRAT.

105
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,235
AND YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND.

106
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:28,969
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID IS SO SCARY

107
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:33,006
ABOUT THIS.

108
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:34,975
>> I'M SURE HE WISHES MORE

109
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,910
REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY, THIS IS

110
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,344
WRONG.

111
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,411
WE SHOULDN'T BE DISRUPTING THE

112
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,412
COUNTRY FOR THIS.

113
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,114
I WANT MORE DEMOCRATS TO GO OUT

114
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:45,919
AND SAY THAT NOW.

115
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,190
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM REALLY

116
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,929
SERIOUSLY EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY,

117
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:57,731
AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE

118
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,332
LIVED THROUGH 1998 AND SO MANY

119
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:02,135
PEOPLE GET SWEPT UP IN IT.

120
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,336
THESE YOUNG STAFFERS PAYING

121
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:04,537
THEIR LEGAL BILLS, IT MAKES THEM

122
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,973
NEVER WANT TO WORK IN POLITICS

123
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,309
AGAIN.

124
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:11,011
>> I AM GLAD TO SEE PEOPLE COME

125
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:13,446
UP TO ME AND SAY, THEY REALLY

126
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:15,081
ENJOY READING BOTH SIDES OF

127
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:15,415
THIS.

128
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,951
I SEE PEOPLE HAVING DEBATES

129
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:18,718
WITHIN FAMILIES.

130
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:19,619
VERY TOUCHING LETTERS FROM

131
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:22,122
PEOPLE WHO WENT TO JAIL BASED ON

132
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:23,990
PREVIOUS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL

133
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,759
INVESTIGATIONS WHO APPRECIATE AN

134
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,660
HONEST PERSPECTIVE ON THIS.

135
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,129
>> Martha: WHILE WE WILL TRY

136
00:04:29,129 --> 00:00:00,000
TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
