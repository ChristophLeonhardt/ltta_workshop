Pakistan has summoned the US ambassador over a tweet posted by Donald Trump on New Year's Day in his first Twitter salvo of 2018 the American president accused the Islamabad of quote nothing but lies and deceit Samir account has the story us-pakistan relations are at an all-time low lately with protests raging on all across the country Pakistanis have taken to the streets burning American flags and chanting anti-trump slogans now this is all after Trump targeted Pakistan in his first tweet of 2018 great way to start off the New Year accusing them of providing safe havens for terrorists they're pursuing in Afghanistan the United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies and deceit thinking of our leaders as fools they give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan with little help no more but this is nothing new Trump seems to be repeating his earlier statements from back in August when he slammed Pakistan for allegedly sheltering terrorists and threatened to reduce aid to the country if it does continue to harbor criminals and terrorists at that time the u.s. decided to hold 255 million dollars in military aid until Pakistan did more to combat terrorism and this is a policy that the White House just recently announced will continue foreign minister of pakistan Khwaja asif even chimed in dismissing trump's tweet as a political stunt saying that the u.s. is trying to shift blame for its own failures in afghanistan he is again and again venting his frustrations on Pakistan over America's failures in Afghanistan as they are trapped in a dead-end street and this isn't even it from Islamabad side the Pakistani government held an emergency security meeting on Tuesday and according to reports there will also be a meeting in Parliament to craft a joint strategy over the issue now both the u.s. and Pakistan have been embroiled in the war on terror since the very beginning and they formed a strategic alliance to fight the Taliban and al Qaeda a fact that Trump seems to be ignoring but sadly US policy in Afghanistan has appeared to fail time and I'm again and it doesn't look like the US has come up with a viable solution to the conflict so maybe Trump should rethink stirring up trouble with a US ally well many Pakistanis themselves didn't appreciate Donald Trump's comments it's actually quite demeaning and embarrassing to know as a Pakistani that what is actually happening pakistan vs pakistan is have spent millions we have sacrificed the lives of many soldiers of for the water in terror the war which actually wasn't the water which actually impacted the whole world and wasn't just the age they have given us is nothing compared to our huge human losses the time has come for us to be united they can't do anything against us these are just words Trump is frustrated because of Afghanistan and he directs his frustration at Pakistan as a citizen I would say the real problem is our rulers accepting US aid we don't need their aid we're retired lieutenant general of the Pakistani army Talaat Massoud thinks blaming Pakistan will not help the situation in Afghanistan he is just trying to sort of express his frustrations in fact he's trying to blame place blame on Pakistan to sort of shift the blame on exactly what the American policy has failed to do they think that by placing blame on Pakistan and they are going to solve the problem of Afghanistan they are sadly mistaken it is in the foremost interest of Pakistan to have stability in Afghanistan because if there is one country which is most adversely affected by the the poor conditions in Afghanistan or instability in Afghanistan is Pakistan so how on earth do they think that Pakistan would like to destabilize Afghanistan and not contribute towards efforts that would really stabilize and make up understand a peaceful country a NATO mission in Afghanistan has announced one u.s. service member has been killed in combat the mission statement adds that four more service members were wounded in the incident it took place on Monday and Ungaro province but no further details were given on what exactly occurred earlier a province spokesperson a nice that NATO led Afghan forces carried out air and ground operations killing over 60 ISIL terrorists he added that because the militants riding in local residence houses civilians were also hit with at least one killed on 13 more did here's what civilians there told us about what happened a woman was killed two men and two others were burned there all the victims are here in hospital some lost their legs I was also injured by shrapnel over 18 people were wounded and others were killed see the child here in the bed he lost his leg his mother was also killed in the incident helicopters and jets hit the people some of them lost legs four people were killed a vehicle which was used by villagers was destroyed these American forces always say we can target with precision every little thing on the ground what kind of technology is this that they can't tell the difference between militants and civilians we don't trust their technology because they say we don't kill civilians but this attack was carried out on civilians
