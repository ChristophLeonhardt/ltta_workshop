VARIOUS POINTS IN NORTH KOREA
THERE HAVE BEEN AMERICAN
PRISONERS THERE, WE KNOW
SOMETIMES THEY ARE RETURNED TO
US AND THAT IS SEEMINGLY GOOD
NEWS BACON AND HORRIBLY.
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD
NEWS, IT HAS TO DO WITH THREE
PRISONERS.
THEY ARE THE ONLY PRISONERS
BELIEVED TO BE HELD IN NORTH
KOREA.
THEY HAVE NO ACTUALLY BEEN
RELEASED.
IT 
SEEMS LIKE NONSENSE THAT WE
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AT ALL.
IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH THE
SUMMIT THAT WILL BE
HAPPENING AT SOME POINT IN THE
FUTURE.
I THINK THE SCARIEST THING
ABOUT THIS IS THAT AFTER HIS
TWEET NOBODY BELIEVED HIM AND
THAT IS SO SAD.
THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN MAKE A
STATEMENT LIKE THREE AMERICAN
PRISONERS ARE COMING HOME FROM
NORTH KOREA.
I THINK PART OF THE REASON IS
THAT LAST WEEK RUDY GIULIANI
SAID THEY WOULD BE COMING HOME
ON THURSDAY, THEN TWO THINGS
HAPPENED.
THEY DIDN'T, AND HE IS NOT A
WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE AND DOESN'T
HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE SO
NOBODY COULD EXPLAIN HOW HE
WOULD EVEN KNOW.
THE OTHER PART OF THE REASON
IS EVERYTHING IS A LIE.
THANKFULLY THEY DID IN THE END
BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AMAZING
FOR BOTH OF THEM AND THEIR
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
I JUST READ SOMETHING LAST
WEEK SAYING THIS IS A
RESULT OF A PRESIDENT 
THAT LIES
CONSISTENTLY.
THERE IS ALWAYS A ROUNDABOUT
WAY OF SAYING HE IS A
CONSISTENT LIAR.
IT IS THE AGE-OLD TALE.
ONCE THERE IS SOMETHING REAL OR
SERIOUS OR NECESSARY, NO
ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVE HIM
ANYMORE EVEN SUPPORTERS.
SO THIS IS A RESULT OF THAT SO
WHEN IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS
REAL OR POSITIVE LIKE THESE
THREE MEN, YOU HAVE NUMBER THE
SUPPORT OF EVEN YOUR OWN
SUPPORTERS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE ñ I REMEMBER
THE FEELING.
I CAN IMAGINE BEING A WEIRD
STATE OF WE WILL SEE.
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WHAT YOU
GET IS HIM SAYING IT IS ME.
EVERYBODY SAYS I SHOULD WIN A
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
I DON'T THINK SO BUT EVERYONE
ELSE THINKS.
THIS DOES APPEAR TO BE
BECAUSE OF HIM.
OBVIOUSLY US JOURNALISTS ARE
GOING TO BE BIASED IN TERMS OF
THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE US AS
OPPOSED TO OTHER COUNTRIES SO
I'M NOT SHOCKED TO FIND OUT.
I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ñ
WHICH PART OF DONALD TRUMP'S
BEHAVIOR OR DISCUSSIONS WITH KIM
JONG-IL AND WOULD LEAD TO THIS
TYPE OF POSITIVE RESULT?
IS IT
TWEETS?
I 
THINK AGREEING COULD MEET
AND UP IN DISASTER.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT
TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THAT.
IN ADDITION TO THE CLOSING DOWN
OF THE SITE THAT LIKELY WASN'T
OPERATING ANYWAY.
SOME OF IT DOESN'T APPARENTLY
COUNT FOR MUCH BUT THIS IS
SOMETHING AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE
IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY
ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT SUMMIT.
WHEN THIS ALL FALLS TO HOW I
WILL REPORT IT TO YOU.
THERE IS INTERNET, OR
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING ñ
INTERNATIONAL DISCUSSIONS
HAPPENING.
YOU SAY NICE THINGS TO HIM, YOU
BE NICE TO HIM, AND YOU WILL GET
WHAT YOU WANT.
I THINK EVERYBODY KNEW THAT
EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP.
COOLEST THINGS GET DONE,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH ME
COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.
HE POINTED OUT THAT THE DECISION
TO ENGAGE WITH THE UNITED STATES
FOR THIS UPCOMING SUMMIT IS NOT
A RESULT OF THE SANCTIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED FROM THE
OUTSIDE.
IT 
IS NOT WHAT BROUGHT THEM TO
THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.
IT IS ONLY IF WASHINGTON
WITHDRAWS THEIR HOSTILE POLICIES
TOO.
IT IS DEEPER THAN THAT AND I
HOPE THEY TAKE IT ONE MORE
LEVEL.
I GRANT IT, IT IS NOT
TOTALLY UP TO THAT AND I THINK
IF IT WERE
IT WOULD PROBABLY END
DIFFERENTLY BUT IT 
IS HAPPENING.
