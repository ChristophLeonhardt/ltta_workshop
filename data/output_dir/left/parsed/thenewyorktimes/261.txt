The companies that beam,
or stream, your favorite
shows onto your screens,
and how much they can get 
away with charging you,
attract a lot of scrutiny
when they start
racking up acquisitions and 
cornering the marketplace.
What keeps them in
check are antitrust laws.
“Unreasonable curbs
on competition
are, in theory, at least, criminal.”
Too much control or market
share can happen in two ways.
The first is horizontal integration.
If one studio gains
monopoly power
by buying up lots 
of other studios,
and the resulting company squeezes 
out the competition across an industry,
or jacks up prices
for consumers,
it could be violating
antitrust laws.
The second way is vertical 
integration of the supply chain.
In the late 1940s, the
government actually went in
and busted up the
Hollywood studio system
because a few behemoths 
owned almost all the studios,
and the theaters,
and they controlled the distribution 
rights to almost all the films.
"Hello, Mr. Aylesworth. How are you?"
That made it extremely difficult
for other companies
in the business of making,
or selling,
or showing movies.
If we look at today’s 
digital landscape,
that would be like if an 
internet provider
also owns the studios 
that make the shows
and the channels, premium 
networks or streaming platforms.
And in some cases,
maybe even the device 
you watch on.
Kind of like, say, 
Apple or Amazon.
The government usually leaves
these kinds of companies alone
if the growth happens
organically, through ingenuity.
But when a company grows
through mergers and acquisitions,
that can raise a red flag.
Historically there have
been fewer challenges
to vertical integration up and 
down the supply chain,
than across industries.
But when AT&amp;T decided it wanted
to merge with Time Warner,
the Department of Justice
decided to challenge the move.
"Your pricing is going to go up.
I don’t think it’s a good
deal for the country."
The companies say they 
need to make this deal
to compete with the Amazons
and Apples of the world.
The question is whether
one huge company
plus another huge company
would turn into one new enormous 
telecom and media company
controlling so much content,
and the way it’s
delivered to you
that it could charge
consumers more
and squeeze out other producers 
suppliers or distributors
who want to make you laugh, 
cry and binge-watch.
