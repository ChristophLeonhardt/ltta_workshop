WAIT A SECOND, THAT WASN’T WHAT WE THOUGHT THE NUMBER WAS.

118
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,787
WE THOUGHT THE NUMBER WAS. WHAT’S REALLY INTERESTING IS THE

119
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:17,289
WHAT’S REALLY INTERESTING IS THE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE OF

120
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:18,590
GUY IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT, WHICH IS

121
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,958

REMOVING THE PARENTS. HOW DO YOU PUT THEM -- GET THEM

STEPHEN MILLER. I DON’T THINK THE PRESIDENT KNEW

174
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:40,339
I DON’T THINK THE PRESIDENT KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT

175
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:41,240
EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT STEPHEN MILLER HAS BEEN GOING

TOLERANCE OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM PARENTS WITHOUT CONSIDERING

00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:11,270
FROM PARENTS WITHOUT CONSIDERING HOW THIS WAS GOING TO WORK, HOW

193
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:12,872
HOW THIS WAS GOING TO WORK, HOW THEY WERE GOING TO BE REUNITED,

HE IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

203
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,020

AND THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF BUREAUCRATIC SILOS, THIS IS A

205
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:32,392
BUREAUCRATIC SILOS, THIS IS A MATTER OF PRESIDENTIAL

206
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:32,825
MATTER OF PRESIDENTIAL INATTENTION.

207
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:33,793
INATTENTION. >> WE’VE HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE

208
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,328
>> WE’VE HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE AND WE HAVE TO PUT IT IN

209
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:35,695
AND WE HAVE TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT.

210
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:36,496
CONTEXT. >> WE’VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM

211
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:37,130
>> WE’VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM LIKE THIS BEFORE.

212
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,065
LIKE THIS BEFORE. >> WELL, WE’VE HAD IT, WE JUST

213
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:40,499
>> WELL, WE’VE HAD IT, WE JUST HAVEN’T TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH.

214
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,501
HAVEN’T TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

215
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,936
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, WE SEPARATED FAMILIES.

216
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,871
WE SEPARATED FAMILIES. WE SEPARATED FATHER FROM MOTHER

217
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:47,640
WE SEPARATED FATHER FROM MOTHER AND CHILDREN AND WE HELD MOTHER

218
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,342
AND CHILDREN AND WE HELD MOTHER AND CHILDREN INDEFINITELY.

219
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:50,243
AND CHILDREN INDEFINITELY. SOME PEOPLE COMPLAINED.

220
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:51,478
SOME PEOPLE COMPLAINED. BUT I DON’T THINK A LOT OF

221
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,213
BUT I DON’T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE PAID ATTENTION TO IT.

222
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,948
PEOPLE PAID ATTENTION TO IT. WE’VE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.

223
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,649
WE’VE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. WE HAVE A DISASTROUS IMMIGRATION

224
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,051
WE HAVE A DISASTROUS IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO FIX IT.

225
00:05:59,062 --> 00:06:00,754
SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO FIX IT. THAT’S WHY WE NEED LEGISLATION.

226
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:01,722
THAT’S WHY WE NEED LEGISLATION. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THE PERSON

227
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:03,957
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THE PERSON THAT’S WORKING ON THIS

228
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,493
THAT’S WORKING ON THIS DAY-TO-DAY IS STEPHEN MILLER.

229
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:07,761
DAY-TO-DAY IS STEPHEN MILLER. I PUT RESPONSIBILITY ON THE

230
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:08,962
I PUT RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PRESIDENT, ABSOLUTELY.

231
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:11,898
PRESIDENT, ABSOLUTELY. THE BUCK STOPS WITH HIM.

232
00:06:11,941 --> 00:06:13,066
THE BUCK STOPS WITH HIM. BUT I THINK THIS WAS CONCEIVED

233
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:13,700
BUT I THINK THIS WAS CONCEIVED BY MILLER.

234
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:14,968
BY MILLER. >> I ALSO THINK THERE IS

235
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,169
>> I ALSO THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THE

236
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,370
SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THE JUDGE IS BASICALLY SAYING GIVE

237
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,938
JUDGE IS BASICALLY SAYING GIVE US A LIST OF WHO YOU HAVE.

238
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:19,973
US A LIST OF WHO YOU HAVE. WE DON’T HAVE A LIST?

239
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:21,775
WE DON’T HAVE A LIST? >> IT SOUNDS LIKE HE’S TRYING

240
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,376
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE HE’S TRYING TO -- LOOK, I’LL GIVE YOU MORE

241
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,811
TO -- LOOK, I’LL GIVE YOU MORE TIME BUT I’VE GOT TO KNOW YOU’RE

00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:25,278
TIME BUT I’VE GOT TO KNOW YOU’RE DOING THIS.

243
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,112
DOING THIS. >> EXACTLY.

244
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:28,281
>> EXACTLY. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, WE

245
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,482
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, WE EXPECTED THE JUDGE TO DO THIS,

246
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:30,883
EXPECTED THE JUDGE TO DO THIS, TO GIVE THEM AN EXTENSION, BUT

247
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,586
TO GIVE THEM AN EXTENSION, BUT THEY HAD TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE

248
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:33,320
THEY HAD TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD.

249
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:35,055
ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD. >> I THOUGHT THIS IS A MORE

250
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:36,289
>> I THOUGHT THIS IS A MORE STRINGENT REACTION THAN I

251
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,590
STRINGENT REACTION THAN I THOUGHT.

252
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,792
THOUGHT. I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET MORE

253
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:39,693
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET MORE LEEWAY.

254
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:40,928
LEEWAY. MARIANA, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, SO

255
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,162
MARIANA, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOVERNMENT

256
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,497
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN’T PRODUCE A LIST THAT

257
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:44,197
CAN’T PRODUCE A LIST THAT SATISFIES THIS JUDGE?

258
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,632
SATISFIES THIS JUDGE? >> THE JUDGE SAID HE WOULD RULE

259
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:48,001
>> THE JUDGE SAID HE WOULD RULE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, CHUCK.

260
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,470
ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, CHUCK. SO IF YOU CAN’T REUNIFY THIS

261
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,972
SO IF YOU CAN’T REUNIFY THIS SPECIFIC 2-YEAR-OLD, HE NEEDS TO

00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:55,108
SPECIFIC 2-YEAR-OLD, HE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT YOU’RE ACTUALLY MOVING

263
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:57,644
KNOW THAT YOU’RE ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD WITH THE OTHER 100 KIDS,

00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:03,584
REGARDING THE DNA SAMPLES AND THE FINGERPRINTS THAT THEY ARE

267
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:05,118
THE FINGERPRINTS THAT THEY ARE ASKING OF THESE PARENTS, I’VE

SHE’S BEING TOLD THAT THESE DNA SAMPLES COULD TAKE WEEKS IF NOT

00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,139
THEY VIOLATE THIS COURT ORDER, I MEAN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO,

283
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,808
MEAN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, PUT HHS IN JAIL?

I’M BEING FACETIOUS HERE, YOU GET MY POINT.

00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:31,645
GET MY POINT. LIKE IT’S NOT GOING TO MAKE THEM

00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,747
LIKE IT’S NOT GOING TO MAKE THEM DO IT ANY FASTER.

288
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,182
DO IT ANY FASTER. >> I THINK WHAT ORGANIZATIONS ON

289
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,851
>> I THINK WHAT ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND ARE ALSO WORRIED

290
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:39,353
THE GROUND ARE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT, AND IT WAS THEIR BASIC

291
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,721
ABOUT, AND IT WAS THEIR BASIC COMPLAINT, IS THAT THE FACT THAT

292
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,623
COMPLAINT, IS THAT THE FACT THAT THEY’RE ASKING FOR DNA SAMPLES

293
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,859
THEY’RE ASKING FOR DNA SAMPLES AND ASKING FOR FINGERPRINTS NOW

294
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:46,861
AND ASKING FOR FINGERPRINTS NOW MEANS THAT THE INTAKE PROCESS AT

295
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,762
MEANS THAT THE INTAKE PROCESS AT THE OUTSET WASN’T DONE PROPERLY.

296
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:52,466
THE OUTSET WASN’T DONE PROPERLY. MEANING THAT THERE WAS NO REAL

297
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:54,535
MEANING THAT THERE WAS NO REAL PLAN TO ROOENEUNIFY THESE KIDS W

298
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,770
PLAN TO ROOENEUNIFY THESE KIDS W THEIR PARENTS WHEN THIS PROCESS

299
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,271
THEIR PARENTS WHEN THIS PROCESS BEGAN AND THAT’S WHY THIS WHITE

300
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:58,439
BEGAN AND THAT’S WHY THIS WHITE HOUSE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS

301
00:07:58,482 --> 00:07:59,373
HOUSE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS SCRAMBLING TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW

302
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,207
SCRAMBLING TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW UNDER THE DEADLINE.

303
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:01,542
UNDER THE DEADLINE. >> THAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT

304
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:02,476
>> THAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT.

305
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,578
POINT. APPARENTLY NOBODY THOUGHT THEY

306
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,480
APPARENTLY NOBODY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF THE KIDS

307
00:08:06,490 --> 00:00:00,000
SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF THE KIDS THEY’RE SEPARATING.
