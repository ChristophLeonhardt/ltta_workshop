thing there's a story broke and I read about it I read it on the show yesterday that the Russians were funneling millions of dollars into Hillary Clinton's you know but it was the Clinton Foundation and during this time Clinton was Secretary of State and she approved the sale of a 20% of our uranium supplies to Putin the thing is that what the hill is now reporting is the FBI knew and reported it to the Justice Department and so the Obama administration knew that means Eric Holder knew that means robert muller who was the FBI head knew as now that he's now the special prosecutor investigating trump and they didn't do anything about it this did they hid this it seems like it seemed it really is disturbing it seems like they covered it up what is the media covering they're covering whether Donald Trump said something untoward when he called made a condolence call to a gold star family I mean this is this story this story is trash it is a trash story and I'm gonna I'm gonna cover it a little just to show you why it's trash but also to show you why it's so bad that the media is like seething in its own hatred you know there was a poll recently that says something like 46% was it I think it was 46% of people now believe that the media is making up stories about Trump they're making up stories about Trump and the reason they believe that is because the media is making up stories about the whole Trump they believe it cuz it's true and the thing is that very the trick that they use is they take everything they said he says and they just give it the worst possible spin and it never occurs to anybody to say what just parse that for me what exactly were you saying did you say is they now say that Obama never called gold star families or did you mean that you know you don't always call gold store star families but they don't do that they purposely don't clear it up and now this Florida congresswoman Frederica Wilson this is a woman who has been calling for Trump's impeachment since the first day he was in office and predicting he's gonna be impeached saying he must be impeached she's that person okay she's just she just hates the guy and so she says Donald Trump called the parents of Sergeant David Johnson who was one of the four army guys who were killed in this niger ambush they're out there fighting Boko Haram just one of the worst Islamist groups ever I mean I every I like the fact that every one of these groups has a different name but they're all Islamist groups okay so he called and he said she says he said to her said something insensitive he or she is just reaming him this is on MSNBC but she has been everywhere CNN too he was almost like joking he said well I guess you knew he something to the fact that he knew what he was getting into when he signed up but I guess it hurts anyway you know just matter-of-factly that this is what happens anyone who is signing up for military duty is signing up to die and that's the way we interpreted it and it was horrible it was insensitive it was absolutely crazy and unnecessary now is there really with this with this Russia story with a story a wonderful story out of the EPA that they have stopped this con man practice they had of suing of having people sues called sue and settle they would sue a state for something it was doing and then they'd settle so that the EPA would get even more power in the settlement and then the EPA would say well we can't do anything because we've made this settlement so we have to follow these rules they've ended that practice it was an absolute con game that the EPA was running Donald Trump said to the parents you know he signed on for this he knew what he was signing on for but I guess it really hurts anyway first of all maybe that's not the most articulate thing to say okay I'll grant you that he's not the most articulate guy but what is he uh does anybody does anybody think that Donald Trump has no feeling for the military I mean this is the guy remember remember how Obama would have Marines hold an umbrella over him you know stand there holding umbrella over them as if they were the butler and remember how Donald Trump when the Marines hat blew off the president the United States Trump went and retrieved his hat and put it back on his head twice but I mean does anybody think that this is a guy who doesn't care about the military Obama gutted the military you know Trump is trying to build the military back up so he said he said you know I know he signed up for this but I guess it hurts anyway in other words we all every soldier knows when he takes this job that he is risking his life but when it happens it is still awful that's obviously what he was saying that is obviously what he was saying and how is this so really Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House spokeswoman she said everything that has to be said about this I think it is appalling what the congresswoman has done in the way that she's politicized this issue and the way that she is trying to make this about something that it isn't this was a president who loves our country very much who has the greatest level of respect for men and women in the uniform and wanted to call and offer condolences to the family and I think to try to create something from that that the congresswoman is doing is frankly appalling and disgusting so let's say let's just cut off the crazy left for a minute because I know we love to concentrate on the clava crazy left cuz they're so crazy and you have to concentrate on them because they will eat their way into the heart of American society if you don't stop them but still just cut those people off let's say that's 10-15 percent of the people the rest of the people if they took a breath if they calm down for a minute would anyone believe you know maybe if you're further left you are the more you hate Donald Trump you might say wow this guy's an oaf you know lay this guy who can't even speak he can't speak right now there but does anybody really believe that this is a big news story that this is something that needs to be politicized that the grief the grief that these people these parents of our heroes the guys were out there fighting to keep us free the grief they must feel I'm sure there's nothing a president can say that is gonna make anything you know make it any better does that really have to become a news story so okay so she's politicizing this thing that congresswoman is politicizing this thing and Trump says you know go ask go ask John Kelly the general who's now his chief of staff go ask John Kelly about his son because his son was killed in Afghanistan Robert and Donald Trump made a very beautiful speech on Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery and talked about how he grieved with John Kelly and all this stuff but Obama never called John Kelly apparently and and Trump talked about that on Fox radio I think I've called every family of somebody that's died and it's the hardest call to make and I said it very loud and clear yes say the hardest thing for me to do is do that now as far as other representatives I don't know I mean you could ask general Kelly did he get a call from Obama you could ask other people I don't know what Obama's policy was I write letters and I also call so okay I just I have to play this right so there they have this woman fredericka you know Wilson on she's on every station she's politicizing this phone call she's making a big deal of it she's calling the Niger killings Trump's Benghazi you know that no evidence of anything like this at all we don't know anything really about it needs to be investigated we need to find out more about it but the call at Trump's Benghazi is absurd and ridiculous I don't even know why that has to fill up airspace so now Trump says this about John Kelly and here's Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough does the thing saying you know the media shouldn't be covering this we have to cover important things like health care and all this so we have to cover this but while we're talking about it and then he says this do you think mica if we have to talk about what's happened over the past several days from this story I think we have it would make more sense to talk about what the president did to the chief of staff and his wife and their daughter-in-law and their grandchildren and their family when the the president dragged their son into the limelight for a cheap political shot in the talk radio show so so used his sons dead body to attack Barack Obama and by extension how their predecessors if there's going to be a discussion I think that's the discussion to be had exactly what is John Kelly's response to the President of the United States doing something that no one no president with any shred of humanity would ever consider doing he he brings up John Kelly defending himself and he has no shred of humanity but nobody's gonna even question only a woman from the BBC that kETK questioned congresswoman Wilson about what she's doing about whether she was pullet politicizing any you know it is all the doubles it's not it's being on double standard it's just hate it is just hate and all the news that's not being covered while they talk about this is the point all the scandals that are coming out from the Obama administration the real story about Comey and how he basically was drafting a letter in May before he'd even talked to Hillary Clinton he was drafting a letter in May exonerating Hillary Clinton these these are the news stories and these are the things that are not being covered why does it matter why do I keep picking on the press why why don't I like getting into the substantive issues it's because I think the press is at the heart of what is happening in this country this is a divided country but we're not a divided people we're not a divided people when you see the Hurricanes hit and down south you didn't see people knocking on door saying you a Democrat or a Republican because I I want to figure out whether to save you or not I want to figure out whether to bring my boat from the next state over and roll over you know you got to be at the same party you didn't see that you didn't see people saying are you Blacky white when people were risking their lives in the Vegas shooting you didn't see people asking what political party you were from you didn't see bait only the press is selling this and they're selling it because they're Democrats and they're selling it for political purposes they know they are setting a narrative they're setting a narrative and the narrative is that there is the Democrat side you know gay marriage government health care all these things and the other side is hatred let me just show you it's just to go back in time for a minute remember Barack Obama was evolving in his feelings about gay marriage and and this is an issue that I truly doesn't matter to me one way or the other I don't think I'm always from more freedom let people do whatever they want if if that can be done if that can be done let people do whatever they want and we'll deal with the problems as they come up but Barack Obama didn't feel that he could say this 2008 he this is what he was saying do we have that cut yes 2008 is number 17 I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman now for me as a Christian for me as a Christian is also a sacred Union you know God's in in the mix okay so it's a sacred union God is in the mix it's gay marriage is not a good thing now California then had Proposition 8 remember that said there should not be gay marriage they voted for it it won handily and was struck down by the court which said you have no right to pass your own laws we we are the court we will pass the laws for you Keith Olbermann then working for MSNBC comes on and he makes this speech about that vote to me this vote is horrible horrible because this isn't about yelling and this isn't about politics this is about the human heart and if that sounds corny so be it if you voted for this proposition or you support those who did or the sentiment they expressed I have some questions because truly I do not understand why does this matter to you what is it to you in a time of impermanence and fly-by-night relationships these people over here want the same chance at permanence and happiness that is your option they don't want to deny you yours they don't wanna take anything away from you they want what you want a chance to be a little less alone in the world so so if you agree with this or if you agree with the sentiments behind it you're a horrible person who just wants gay people to be alone in the world but not Barack Obama you know but Barack weathers 2008 same year that Obama was saying these things before he evolved right but not Barack Obama if if everyone who voted for this was hateful why wasn't Barack Obama hey they are selling you a bill of goods they're selling you these lies there they're setting up I always say when you argue with leftist you should never talk about people don't talk about Trump don't talk about Obama talk about principles talk about principles because when you go after them on principles they cannot argue with you when you go at you know since all people do bad things you get into these stupid arguments well he did this and he did that so you know they are feeding they are feeding the vision that is is really you know endangering our polity it's endangering the country it is causing us to treat each other badly and it's all of it generating from this hateful churning with eight press this spewing it's hate on to us and toxifying our conversation i want to get to this New York Times thing about Hitler but Lee Smith is on the line and I don't want to keep him waiting so Lee are you there I am thanks for having me oh it's good to see you Lee Smith is the senior editor at the Weekly Standard writes great stuff all over the place I saw you in the Federalist and I said I saw your piece about the steel dossier in the Federalist and the reason I wanted to have you on is because this this story every time I read about it I find it by the third paragraph I can't follow it it's so complex and in order to for people to understand it they have to remember with the steel dossier is and we have to give at least some explanation of the Magnitsky act so let's listen let's start with what the steel dossier was and where it came from okay the steel dossier was a file compiled by a Washington DC communications firm called fusion GPS and what it is this is the this is the premise for the Trump Russian narrative or the great Kremlin conspiracy as I like to call it that's been filling the filling the media print and broadcast for nearly a year now there was this insane con juries of unfortunately pornographic fantasy the different stuff that the president president Trump is supposed to have been doing clearly there's some disinformation in there clearly there is also things that may be true they may have her actually heard different Russian officials saying different things to other Russian officials but that's it's named the steel dossier because the man whose byline was on it is Christopher steel and this a former yeah I'm sorry go ahead this is the this is the document though that made Comey I mean Comey was kind of swayed by this wasn't III think that Comey took a lot of it to heart but it's unclear why whether or not he was part of I mean look what the steel dossier is it's political warfare right it's political warfare and call me it's unclear whether or not Comey was participating in a campaign of political warfare against newly elected president Trump when he and other intelligence officer officials went and briefed both outgoing President Obama an incoming president Trump on the existence of a nonsensical document that the press held off on publishing because none of it was verifiable okay the point of the point of briefing President Obama and President Trump on this nonsensical dossier and we can go into further details about why it's absurd though the whole premise of it the reason that they briefed Obama and Trump was to put it into the open right so at that point the press could report oh all of these Press organizations already had the document they would not publish it because they knew it was nonsense but they couldn't verify it but it was when the intelligence community briefed President Obama and President Trump on it they thought that they could go out it and release this dossier what it said CNN was the first one out reporting on the briefing and then it was BuzzFeed that same afternoon that that actually released the document oh okay so now now we've got the steel dog it's yeah I know I don't I I want to keep it a simpler because it's very hard to follow so we've got the steel document that sometimes called the the you know right it's the thing with the Russian prostitutes and all this stuff so we we've got that and has come out now on the other side we have the Magnitsky Act and I don't want to get into the deep weeds but the press keeps basically saying oh this is about a Russian adoption but it's not what it's about the magnet C Act macness key was a a lawyer who was basically murdered by Putin's Russia is that fair to say yes he was detained in jail mistreated and and and and likely murdered and there's certainly a lot of evidence that meg Minsky was murdered in jail by his by his captors and supination this is so to punish the Russians they passed this thing that has become known as the Magnitsky act right yes bill Browder William Browder had hired Magnitsky to look into corruption against ten the Russian officials the Russian officials pulled Meg Minsky and put him in jail so bill bradder has been the driving force behind anti Meg but behind the Magnitsky Act which sanctions different Russian officials close to the regime of lat amir putin it's okay and Putin hates this because it makes it hard for them to feed their money out into Western banks right is exactly okay it's a key Russian foreign policy goal to try to dismantle that sanctions regime against Russian officials okay and I know this is a big part of how Putin has bought his way to power this is letting people deal with the wet you know letting people basically buy up what the Soviet Union used to own and then send their money out to the west okay so what what is the connection between the sale dossier and the Magnitsky a steel dossier as I said was compiled by Washington DC communications firm known as fusion GPS so ostensibly they put this they put this out there to show that Donald Trump was going to collude was colluding with different Russian officials for you know and the quid pro quo was he would win the 2016 presidential election with Russia's help if he promised to dismantle sanctions on Russia so fusion GPS put that document out there except fusion GPS is also a part of the anti Magnitsky campaign they are working on behalf of Russian interests to dismantle a sanctions regime against Russian officials so this this propaganda Factory has been hired right by Russian officials to get to propagandize against the Magnitsky Act right so the thing that we have to look at then and this is something a couple of press outfits have mentioned that this is curious but most of them have not most of the people that were watching whether it's CNN whether it's NBC large parts of the large the print media they're not putting together the fact that this company this organization is doing is doing on one hand it's clearly paid by Russia and on the other hand the more closely we look at it it seems quite possible the steel dossier is also a function of a Russian information war war campaign so that's what this is so I think that it's time that people look very closely at what this organization is doing thank goodness up on the hill now senator Grassley is looking closely at this just yesterday I believe it was two of the two of fusion gps's principals decided to take the Fifth Amendment and not not answer questions regarding the Steel da say and probably anti Magnitsky campaign as well so so how does the press I mean we've been talking all week here about NBC and their incredibly corrupt behavior around the Harvey Weinstein scandal you know basically putting a lid on their entertainment arm as well as their news alright but NBC was involved in this as well weren't they yes William Browder when I spoke and I wrote the long article for The Federalist William Browder believes that Ken Delaney and from NBC News is working he alleges that they're working in tandem with fusion GPS Wow Browder Browder also says and this is I have this from a few other journalists as well is that fusion GPS is a very important organization in this city they in Washington and in New York they assemble lots of different stories and they put them out they hand them out to people these guys are deeply embedded in the press in press circles Browder said a Browder said that when he tried to get tried to get the attention of different editors here in Washington in New York and what fusion GPS the world they were playing in the Magnitsky campaign they all backed off the journalists the editors backed off saying sorry fusion GPS is much too embedded and our processes we're not going to go after them that you may have seen yeah you may have seen yesterday also one more things that it's not just they have their hands in lots of very dirty campaigns may have seen a story in Fox News yesterday about fusion gps's role and smearing Venezuelan journalist Thor Halvorssen Alec Boyd Fox did a story on this last night I reported this for tablet magazine about two months ago so fusion GPS it's important to understand the different things they do they don't just package package articles for journalists to pick up on they also manage smear campaigns yeah this is Matt Steele does is it's a smear campaign against Trump and they did this in vain as well as well they're doing it with Bill Browder do they I mean I know this is a big part of the news now these guys who just feed smears to the media and the media use the smears so they don't want to they don't want to alienate the sources of the smears they want to so so what wouldn't what is it about Donald Trump that and the Magnitsky acted the Putin basically said think the Trump would not touch the Magnitsky Act but maybe Hillary would do you think I'm not sure it's that clear I mean my sense is that my sense is that an information operation like this the target can't be too specific right so for me from the very beginning the idea that somehow they were targeting they were going after Hillary to ensure Trump's victory seemed nonsensical right they might have thought who knows what goes through their head oh yeah we would prefer trump but these things backfire so quickly and information operation has to be very broad I think the I think the target was which they hit which they it was to sow confusion in the American political system that's with it look how easily it backs it backfires right if they say well we're going to try to elect Trump and then they elect Trump then all this news comes out and the president who's actually in powers is like well I I can't give these guys a break or I look like I'm crooked I have to come down even harder on that the Russians have been doing information operations for a very long time we'll go back to the the elders of the protocols of Zion they know how to run information campaigns this was supposed to be a very broad campaign it was they've been hugely successful and it's it's an amazing smoothly thanks partly to the American press who blinks and large to the American who plays along no question about it Lee Smith senior editor of the week standard I know you've just been through there through an ordeal yourself I really appreciate your coming on it's great seeing you thanks a lot this is you know I'm reading Sheryl Atkinson's new book smear and she just talks about this is that you cannot this is this is now a major part of the news business is printing these smears that are fed to you by operatives and fusion gps is among the chief this was basically perfected by the Clinton campaign when they were going after the bimbos as they called them who Clinton was abusing this is kind of their their they kind of invented the modern smear and it's being carried on like this the one thing about Putin is you've got to remember he could not have known that Donald Trump was gonna be President the United States he must have been playing his game to wrong-foot Hillary because he must have thought she was good you know and he it sounds like she bought her it you know it really does anyway tracker I love tracker

me this thing I mean really it is just absolutely indispensable so I have to read you this New York Times column I let us go to the New York Times op-ed page or as I like to call it knucklehead row alright Charles blow the most aptly named columnist at the New York Times because everything he writes blows he wrote this column today trumpet isn't Hitler but you know the old expression that everything you say before but doesn't matter Trump isn't Hitler but the lying the lying he so he starts out he says it is a commonly accepted rule among those who are in the business of argument especially online that he or she who invokes Adolf Hitler either an oratory or essays automatically forfeits the argument the reference to Hitler is deemed far too extreme too explosive too far beyond rational correlation no matter how bad a present-day politician not one of them has charted or is charting a course to exterminate millions of innocent people as an act of ethnic cleansing and yet I cannot believe the New York Times ran this piece and yet as many have noted no person of sound reason or even cursory political awareness cannot be immediately struck by how similar Hitler's strategy of line is to Donald Trump's seeming strategy of line tell a lie bigger than people think a lie can be thereby forcing their brains to seek truth in it or vest some faith in it even after no proof can be found that writes badly to trump is no Hitler hold the press hold the by Trump is no Hitler but but the way he has manipulated the American people without rageous lies stacked one on top of the other has an eerie historical resonance demagogy has a fixed design just this week Trump told the colossal lie that President Obama and other presidents most of them didn't make calls to the families of fallen soldiers and once again we see them taking what he said which was not that they never made calls but they didn't always make calls Trump and Bush they sent out form letters it's a time of war cannot be on the phone all the time but when called out about this lie trump quickly retreated to one of his shield phrases that's what I was told the world has seen powerful leaders use lying as a form of mass manipulation before this is an amazing amazing piece of trash that really belongs in a left-wing college sophomore rag the world has been powerful seeing powerful leaders use line as a form of mass manipulation before it is seen it now and it will no doubt see it again history recycles but the result doesn't have to be and hopefully never will be again a Holocaust it can manifest as a multitude of other lesser Horrors in both protocol and policy including the corrosion and regression of country and culture that is the very real threat we are facing that from the New York Times now you know all week our friend James O'Keefe over progr project Veritas has been catching out New York Times editors of various levels who were basically - saying yeah we hate Trump and we run our stories to destroy Trump that's what we're doing as what the New York Times is doing we used to be a newspaper now we're a left-wing rag that runs stories trying to destroy Trump so Dean bag baguette back at the the guy I call blithering prevarication the third is yeah the third who runs the New York Times said it was a sin to do this it was a sin to do undercover journalism against the New York Times and you know the New York Times just did an undercover piece about the all right they just went undercover yeah but that wasn't as him but this is a sin but luckily luckily James O'Keefe got the what's his name levy Clifford levy the deputy manager in managing editor of the New York Times he confronted him and Levy explained everything just came out clean he was very honest and direct here's the video mr. levy James O'Keefe Project Veritas Dudek still working at the New York Times you said you're reviewing the situation we checked he's no longer on the directory at New York hunts website any comment about Desiree shooter released yesterday she's a senior editor and she said the same thing that he said you said that Nick was just a junior position who did the unethical activity so what you have to say that now a senior editor has been exposed no comment do you agree with Dean Beck a executive editor staying on a cinema he's avoiding us he is going into the coffee shop the deputy managing editor for the New York Times has ran into a coffee shop and is avoiding us at project or a duster doing the same thing that they do were asking him simple questions does their paper use their paper for editorial agenda I just love that I love that and you know why do you know why they're acting like that they're acting it is like Watergate it's like just like you know the public officials corrupt public officials running away from the press and you know why it's like it's a sin because they're the ones who decide they are that you know remember like in Breaking Bad I am the one who knocks the New York Times thinks they are the ones who decide who's corrupt they can't it can't be them being corrupt it's a sin to investigate them because they are the investigators they are the ones who decide and you know if you want to talk about lies and you want to talk about Hitler gurbles used to say the you know the Hitler's propaganda minister would say that the way to do this is you keep repeating lie over and over again until it's in people's heads and this is what the press keeps doing they keep saying you know the the one I keep referencing because it's so powerful is Donald Trump said there were really nice people on the in the white supremacist movement when you go back to the transcript he's obviously saying there were really good people who who supported the Confederate statues but they just keep repeating the lie over and over again so somebody and we just heard from Lee Smith how you know fusion GPS propagated these lies with the help with the help of James Comey with the help of NBC News with the help of all these reporters who don't want to take these Liars down so when we are talking about the big lie you know I don't know I don't wanna I don't want to make reference to Hitler but the New York Times and the rest of the press have a lot to answer for stuff I like all right so yesterday in the mailbag that really was a good mailbag I really enjoyed them yesterday in the mailbag somebody asked about scary episode scary things for Halloween you know and obviously I was naming some of the things I liked which I like ghost stories but I was thinking that you know there used to be all these anthology shows I've tried a number of times they're starting restarting up Spielberg's amazing stories I think but I've tried a number of times to get a new anthology show getting going but the the the studios don't like them because they're expensive because you have to hire a new cast new script new sets every single time and you can't do it the way you used to do it in a soundstage all the time so it's more expensive so they don't like these things and they're afraid they'll lose audience and all this stuff so anthology shows have kind of gone out of fashion we don't know if they've gone out of fashion with human beings but they've gone out of fashion with studio heads so they're not being made but when you go back to some of these things they were some really really spooky stories and some obscure ones that only I know they're really stories that only I know one of them now this one Roald Dahl everybody knows Roald Dahl because of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Matilda what are some of the others the amazing the dfj amazing mr. Fox and all stuff he was a wonderful children's writer but he was also a really really weird writer for adults and he won the Edgar several times so twice I think as many times as I've won it actually he must be a really good writer I've been nominated five times but I've won it twice but Roald Dahl run and one of the stories he ran when it for was called the landlady and it is in his anthology kiss kiss and his adult stories are really really creepy but what other things that people don't know because I think it was a British thing was he had a anthology show called Roald Dahl's tales of the unexpected and the landlady was one of their shows and I remember seeing it and it just sent a an absolute chill up my spine it's about a British guy down by I can't remember he's in Brighton or whatever and he can't get a hotel room so he goes to what like a B&B a Breton bed-and-breakfast and he meets the landlady and here's just the scene where he first comes in the chain at night safer welcome home dear I tell all my guests that to treat my house as home home from home dear to put your head there let me help you with your coat I expect you're from London aren't you that's right yes you'll find a bath so much more restful shall I lead the way oh please we have the house all to ourselves the fact is I'm just a teeny weeny bit Jews particular if you see what I mean but I'm always ready be prepared as I'm used to saying the Girl Guides everything's always ready here just a very creepy lady in the place of course I guess it's a creepier and creepier I don't wanna give anything away it's only a half hour I personally I would read the story because I love reading stories rather than watching them but this is and by the way it's on YouTube the whole show is on YouTube you can just watch it right there another one from Twilight Zone a lot of people don't know that the Twilight Zone came back in the 80s a color version of it came back in the 80s and it was not very good and it was kind of I don't know it just it's time had passed but the there was one of them written by the great Ray Bradbury and it was called the elevator and I thought I thought this must be a short story and I remember combing through I've lots of collections of Ray Bradbury remember combing through every collection but it wasn't was written specifically for this and it is two brothers it's very short it's like 15 minutes long this you can get on YouTube too it's worth watching two brothers arrive at a closed factory and their their father has gone missing and they know he's been in there there's rumors that he's been doing some secret experiments and all this and the older brother is doesn't really like the father that much but the younger brother is kind of idolizes him and it's the relationship between these two brothers as they go looking for the missing father here's just a quick scene what's the matter well he told me never to come in here if he doesn't want anybody prying he has gone man he's not mad why would he come here in the middle of the night twice a year maybe it's something that doesn't need to be tended to maybe something he's growing it's really spooky can spook your spooker and it really it actually kept me from sleeping for about 10 it's so it's it's really good also I won't play a cut from this come out of time but the hitch-hiker on the original Twilight Zone if you've never seen the episode called the hitchhiker you can't get that on YouTube you can but it's all kind of it's not it's put up there by an amateur yes so it's not it's not really good quality but you can always I think they I think Twilight Zone is still on Netflix yeah you can even get it as easy to get the hitchhiker with the best one of the best episodes ever good Halloween watching that is stuff I like the clave this weekend is not quite upon us because you can watch another Kingdom on iTunes please go on and watch it and please subscribe keep Michael moles employed it is a really good story and there's second episode drops tomorrow Friday which will stave off the clayvin this weekend but then it will come upon you with a vengeance but survivors will gather here on Monday I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show
