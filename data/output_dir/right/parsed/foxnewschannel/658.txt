COUNTRIES MUST PAY MORE.
LESS.
VERY UNFAIR.
PREVIEW OF HIS MESSAGE.
THE EUROPEAN UNION'S OPEN
BORDER POLICY HAS RESULTED
IN A MASSIVE INFLUX OF
MIGRANTS IN THE LAST FEW
YEARS, SURGES TO MORE THAN A
MILLION AT ITS PEAK.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
THIS WEEK WE ARE TAKING A
CLOSER LOOK AT THE EU'S
IMMIGRATION CRISIS AND WHAT
AMERICA CAN LEARN FROM IT.
HERE TO START US OFF IS
FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT
PRESS OFFICER MORGAN OR
TELLING GAS.
MORGAN, THANKS THANKS FOR
JOINING US THIS MORNING.
>> HEY, PETE.
SEE THESE TWEETS FROM THE
PRESIDENT ON NATO.
THAT'S ONE ISSUE.
THE OTHER THING IS WHAT HAS
INSIDE THE BORDERLESS
COUNTRIES OF EUROPE SEEN
THIS INFLUX OF MIGRANTS.
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE HOW
HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF
INSURGENCY OF MIGRANTS.
>> PETE, LIKE ANY OF THESE
ISSUES DEALING WITH A
MIGRANT ISSUE IS INCREDIBLY
COMPLEX.
IF YOU GO BACK TO 1985
THAT'S WHEN THE EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES HAD THE AGREEMENT
WHERE THEY AGREED TO
BASICALLY OPEN BORDERS.
WHERE YOU COULD HAVE TRAVEL
AND GOODS THROUGHOUT THE
EUROPEAN UNION WHERE DO THE
MIGRANTS COME FROM AND WHAT
ARE THE CONDITIONS CREATING
ALL OF THIS.
WITH THIS.
THE MIGRANTS COME FROM.
WHEN THAT HAPPENS ACCORDING
TO THE EU RULES YOU HAVE TO
SEEK ASYLUM IN THE FIRST
COUNTRIES YOU ENTER.
1.8 MILLION OVER THE LAST
FEW YEARS THAT HAVE CAME IN
SINCE WE HAVE SEEN THE
CRISIS IN SYRIA, LIBYA, AND
OTHER PLACES UNFOLD.
THEY ARE HAVING TO ABSORB
INCREDIBLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF
MIGRANTS.
PETE: ANOTHER COUNTRY
ABSORBING A LARGE AMOUNT OF
109,000 IN 2016.
OVER 172,000.
BIG PART OF THAT CIVIL WAR
INFLUX.
HAS EUROPE ADJUSTED TO THE
REALITY THAT THEIR
DEMOGRAPHICS ARE GOING TO
CHANGE IF THEY DON'T DEAL
WITH THEIR BORDERS?
>> I THINK THAT -- WE HAVE
SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS
THE NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN
QUITE DRAMATICALLY.
WE HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT
MORE RESOLUTION IN SYRIA,
ALTHOUGH THAT WAR GOES ON.
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN EUROPEAN
NATIONS MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH
NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO
TRY TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF
MIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY THE
NUMBER OF SMUGGLERS.
YOU SEE THE SAME THING YOU
SEE ON OUR BORDER, HUMAN
TRAFFICKERS TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF AN AWFUL SITUATION.
HERE'S WHERE I THINK THIS
MESSAGE TIES IN WITH WHAT
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING,
PETE, THAT IS SO IMPORTANT.
THE PRESIDENT IS URGING THE
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THESE
NATO COUNTRIES TO SPEND MORE
ON THEIR OWN DEFENSE.
IN 2012 I WAS SCREAMING
BECAUSE THEN PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA DID NOTHING
ABOUT SYRIA WHEN THEY
FAILED STATES LIKE SYRIA AND
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN LIBYA
AND AFRICA, IF WE CHOOSE NOT
TO LEAD IN THESE COUNTRIES
AND HELP RESOLVE THESE
CRISIS THEN YOU WILL SEE
BECAUSE THERE IS A CIVIL WAR
GOING ON IN THEIR COUNTRY.
WHAT ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO
DO?
PETE: INTERESTING TO SEE HOW
NATO COUNTRIES RESPOND TO
THE CALL FOR INCREASING
THEIR DEFENSE BUDGETS.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
PETE: IS HE EXACTLY RIGHT.
THAT'S HOW YOU STRENGTHEN
THE ALLIANCE.
