1
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:03,490
IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE HELD.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,524
>> Neil: BLAKE, THANK YOU, GREAT

3
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:07,093
JOB.

4
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:08,328
MANY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND

5
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:09,929
OUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:10,663
MEETING BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND

7
00:00:10,663 --> 00:00:12,098
NORTH KOREAN LEADERS.

8
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:13,967
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GETTING

9
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:14,868
ALONG FAMOUSLY.

10
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,469
WHAT TO READ INTO THAT AND WHAT

11
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,072
IT SETS THE STAGE FOR WHEN THE

12
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:20,273
NORTH KOREAN LEADER MEETS HIS

13
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:20,974
AMERICAN COUNTERPART, DONALD

14
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:21,975
TRUMP.

15
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,943
LET'S GET THE RODE FROM FORMER

16
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:27,514
CIA INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AND

17
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:31,918
FOREIGN POLICY.

18
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:33,086
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW

19
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:34,153
THE MEETING WENT AND WHAT WE CAN

20
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:35,388
GLEAN FROM THAT.

21
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:36,556
IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE GETTING

22
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:38,258
ALONG JUST FINE.

23
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:39,559
>> WELL, SPECTACULAR AND

24
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,327
HISTORIC.

25
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:43,830
I CAN'T THINK OF ENOUGH

26
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,564
ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAS

27
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:46,499
HAPPENED.

28
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:49,469
BUT IT WAS ABOVE ALL, IT WAS

29
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,137
SUBSTANTIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE.

30
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:55,141
THEY TALKED NOT ONLY ABOUT

31
00:00:55,141 --> 00:01:00,280
DEKNEW CLEEIZING --

32
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,447
DENUCLEARIZING THE PENINSULA,

33
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:04,450
BUT BROADER DISARMAMENT, ENDING

34
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,619
THE WAR BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.

35
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:07,153
AND ABOUT NATIONAL

36
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,022
RECONCILIATION.

37
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:10,690
SOMETHING I'VE HEARD NO ONE TALK

38
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,058
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

39
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:14,427
BRINGING THE FAMILIES TOGETHER.

40
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,963
TRYING TO HEAL THE NATION.

41
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:18,331
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS N ADDITION

42
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,433
TO THE FACT IT'S THE FIRST TIME

43
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:23,970
THAT A NORTH CROW AN LEADER SET

44
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,774
FOOT ON SOUTH CROW AN SOIL --

45
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:30,209
NORTH KOREAN LEADER SET FOOT ON

46
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,144
SOUTH KOREAN SOIL.

47
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:32,445
IT'S HALF OF WHAT THEY TALKED

48
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:34,414
ABOUT IN THE JOINT DECLARATION,

49
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:35,915
IF HALF OF IT OCCURS THE WORLD

50
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:37,450
HAS CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.

51
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,618
>> Neil: PETER THERE'S SO MUCH

52
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:39,719
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON

53
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,187
BEHIND THE SCENES.

54
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:42,889
THEIR GOALS WERE STATED IN

55
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,991
MUTUAL STATEMENTS THAT CAME OUT

56
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:45,725
SHORTLY THEREAFTER WHERE THEY

57
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:48,828
SAID AN END TO WAR AND COMPLETE

58
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:50,029
DENUCLEARIZATION.

59
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:51,531
THAT PUTS THE ONUS ON THE SOUTH

60
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:54,567
CROW A THAN AS WELL, WORKING ON

61
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,301
THE UNITED STATES TOWNS DO THE

62
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:56,069
SAME.

63
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:57,604
HOW WILL THAT BE RECEIVED?

64
00:01:57,604 --> 00:01:58,738
>> WELL, THE DEVIL IS IN THE

65
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,140
DETAILS, NEIL.

66
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,408
RIGHT NOW, I ASSUME THE WHITE

67
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:04,911
HOUSE HAS BEEN BRIEFED BY THE

68
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:05,645
BLUE HOUSE IN SEOUL ABOUT THESE

69
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:06,346
MEETINGS.

70
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:08,681
THEY KNOW MORE THAN WE DO.

71
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:09,983
WE'LL PROBABLY KNOW MORE IN THE

72
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:11,050
COMING DAYS.

73
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,952
FOR US IT'S LIGHT IN DETAILS.

74
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:15,221
TAKING ALL OF THE PROMISES ON

75
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:16,756
PAPER AND PUTTING THEM IN ACTION

76
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,091
ON THE GROUND THAT,'S A

77
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,825
CHALLENGE, HEAVY LIFTING TO BE

78
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:20,326
DONE THERE.

79
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:21,794
THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN

80
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:24,931
SEPARATED BY AN ARMIES ADVERTISE

81
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,065
FOR -- ARMIES ADVERTISE FOR 75

82
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,800
YEARS.

83
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,269
IT'S AN ASPIRATION, I SUPPORT.

84
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,338
THAT AND THE DENUCLEARIZATION

85
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:33,106
ISSUE, WHAT DOES NORTH KOREA

86
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:34,140
MEAN BY THAT.

87
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,142
THERE ARE A LOT OF US WORKING ON

88
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:38,711
NORTH KOREA FOR MANY YEARS, HAVE

89
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:40,713
BEEN THROUGH THE FAILED

90
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:41,914
AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST THAT ARE

91
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:43,549
CONCERNED ABOUT NORTH KOREA

92
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,451
ISN'T REALLY WILLING TO

93
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,919
COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZE.

94
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,687
THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION

95
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:49,689
THAN WE DO.

96
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:50,957
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO KNOW MORE

97
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:52,125
AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE

98
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,527
DONE.

99
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:57,196
ALTHOUGH, SO COLOR ME CAUTIOUSLY

100
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:58,831
OPTIMISTIC BUT DEEPLY SKEPTICAL

101
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:00,733
OF INTENTIONS.

102
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,035
>> Neil: WE HAVE SEEN PROGRESS

103
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,369
THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVE NOT

104
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:06,773
SEEN IN DECADES, TO YOUR POINT,

105
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,675
THE CONCERN SEEMS TO BE WHAT

106
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:09,909
WOULD MAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP GET

107
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:10,877
AWAY FROM THE TABLE, STAND UP

108
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,645
AND WALK AWAY.

109
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:13,713
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT NOT MAKING

110
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:15,181
MUCH PROGRESS.

111
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:18,317
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE?

112
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:20,920
>> FIRST OF ALL LET ME ALSO ADD

113
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,355
THAT THE UPS UNITED STATES IS

114
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,424
MENTIONED IN THE JOINT STATEMENT

115
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:28,161
AS BEING A CENTRAL PLAYER IN ANY

116
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:28,995
NEGOTIATIONS GOING FORWARD

117
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,596
BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH.

118
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:33,332
AND CHINA WAS MENTIONED ONLY

119
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,367
AFTER THAT AS A POTENTIAL FOURTH

120
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,768
PARTY.

121
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:37,637
AND I THINK THAT MEANS THAT

122
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:38,671
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL STICK TO

123
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,173
HIS WORD, BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN

124
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:43,042
VERY CREDIBLE.

125
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:45,244
FOR HIM, IT MEANS

126
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:46,512
DENUCLEARIZATION IN THE WAY WE

127
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:47,180
UNDERSTAND IT, NO NUCLEAR

128
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,715
WEAPONS.

129
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,416
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE U.S.

130
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,584
PRESIDENT AND THE STRONG

131
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:53,352
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, HE'S

132
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:55,755
RECENTLY ASSEMBLED, WITH

133
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:58,858
MR. POMPEO AND MR. BOLTEN IN

134
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:00,893
ADDITION TO SECRETARY MATTIS

135
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:04,063
WILL ALLOW ANY OTHER DEFINITION

136
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,532
OF DENUCLEARIZATION THAN WHAT IT

137
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:07,333
ACTUALLY MEANS TO THE BROADER

138
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,035
WORLD.

139
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:10,536
BUT ALSO, WE WILL HELP

140
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:12,371
FACILITATE THE PEACE PROCESS.

141
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,373
AND THIS IS IN A WAY FULFILLING

142
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:17,176
THE AMERICA FIRST DOCTRINE IN

143
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,878
THE SENSE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

144
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,379
HAS CALLED FOR SELF

145
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,214
DETERMINATION, REGIONAL

146
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:23,182
SOLUTIONS TO REGIONAL PROBLEMS.

147
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:26,619
HE'S HELPED AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL

148
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:27,653
FACILITATE A DISCUSSION BETWEEN

149
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:28,888
NORTH AND SOUTH KREE OH.

150
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:30,223
THAT'S WHAT -- KOREA.

151
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:32,725
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED ALL ALONG.

152
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:33,960
>> Neil: PETER, EVERY AGREEMENT

153
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,595
YOU COME TO, YOU HAVE TO VERIFY

154
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:38,030
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.

155
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,999
WE KNOW FROM PRIOR UNITED

156
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:42,435
NATIONS INSPECTION TEAMS IN

157
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:44,704
PLACES LIKE IRAQ, LIBYA,

158
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,906
ELSEWHERE, THAT CAN BE BROKEN.

159
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,908
>> YEAH, I'M SURE THAT THE WHITE

160
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:49,575
HOUSE TEAM WILL INSIST UPON

161
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:51,043
THAT.

162
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,378
THAT WE HAVE INTRUSIVE

163
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:52,979
INSPECTIONS, NO NOTICE

164
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:53,846
INSPECTIONS.

165
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:54,781
BUT THIS COULD BE A CHALLENGE

166
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,516
WITH NORTH KOREA.

167
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,450
THIS WEEK, WE HAVE MADE

168
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,918
PROGRESS, LIKE I SAID, THERE'S

169
00:04:58,918 --> 00:04:59,919
REASON TO BE AUSHSLY APARTMENT

170
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,321
MYSTIC BUT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

171
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,257
AND OUR HISTORY WITH NORTH KOREA

172
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:04,957
SHOWS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

173
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:06,793
CHALLENGES.

174
00:05:06,793 --> 00:00:00,000
LET'S TEST THEIR DIPLOMATIC
