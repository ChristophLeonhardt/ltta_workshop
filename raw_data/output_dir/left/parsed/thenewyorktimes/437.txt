The Iron Mountain underground
storage facility is located in
what was formerly a
limestone mine.
The nickname internally within
our company is "the underground."
The seasons never change
220 feet underground.
It's very easy for us to maintain
the proper temperature
and humidity based on the type
of media that we store here.
I am Bob Koszela and I'm with Iron Mountain
entertainment services
here 220 feet underground
at the Universal Music vault.
Universal Music is the largest
record label in the world and
this collection represents
the historic recordings of
virtually every known
artist in the world.
This collection is comprised of virtually
every known audio format
throughout history. Having them all
consolidated here in
such close proximity to our digital
studios, allows the clients to be able
to move these assets without
ever leaving the security of
"the underground" and have them digitized
and safely delivered across the web.
We have the Getty photographic collection
which consists of, at this site,
over 25 million
photographic images.
We have folders and content of
Marilyn Monroe.
We have thousands
of images of Marilyn
all of her husbands,
her death, her funeral
the police investigation. We have
folders and folders of her content.
It's impervious from the majority of the
manmade disasters as well as natural
disasters, since we are a couple
hundred feet underground.
We have our own fire brigade.
We have armed guards at the
gate 24 hours a day seven days
a week protecting the material, the media
that our customers are sending to us.
