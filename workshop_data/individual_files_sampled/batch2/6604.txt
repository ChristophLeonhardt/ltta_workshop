big money and special interests by contributing directly to your favorite candidate just open up the browser on your mobile phone and go to down ticket calm you guys remember Tim Geithner he was Treasury secretary for Barack Obama he did the bank bailouts and he told us we had to do it we had to do it but we have your best interests in mind but these bankers but golly gee I'm so mad at them but you know we gave him all the money anyway because of course we were forced to well what's Geithner up to these days well he's running a company let's tell you about that as Treasury secretary in the Obama administration Timothy Geithner condemned predatory lenders now he is president of Warburg Pincus in New York firm that controls a private equity fund that owns marina finance well let's find out more about marina finance because I know that Geithner will not stand for predatory lenders well Washington boasts terrific story about this and they have a couple of different examples of people who were personally affected one is Stephen hugging's that they start the story with he gets a check in the mail one day for $1,200 that's weird right and it says you have some period of time to cash this check and it's yours now you read the fine print asses and you'll be charged 33% he thinks well that's none good I don't want that that's too high an inch said he puts it away but there our effort is to try to tempt him well as it turns out that a week later his Chevy pickup breaks down now he needs the money so it goes and uses a check oh and that is when the trouble begins so let me pick it up from the Washington Post there within a year the company marina finance sued Huggins for 3221 27 cents that included the original $1200 plus an additional $800 a company representative later persuaded him to take plus hundreds of dollars in processing fees insurance and other items plus interest it didn't matter that he'd made a few payments already oh you want to make payments I don't care about your payments no no you give it to me now otherwise we're gonna crush you okay to give you a sense of how outrageous a 33 percent interest rate is Donald Trump and to be fair it was Trump aney is a buffoon but couldn't make money in casinos because he had taken out an interest rate that was way too high and even though the house always wins it still didn't cover the interest rate because the interest rate was 14% the ones being charged to middle-class Americans through this companies 33 percent it's impossible to keep up with that let alone all the stuff that they ought add on top of it that's all in the fine print that was not at all clear so then you have an overwhelming debt that you can't possibly pay back so an equipment operator in Nashville says that that's this hugging's guy it says it would have been cheaper for me to go out and borrow money from the mob well in a lot of ways that's true and that's why loan sharking was prohibited but what we've done is we've made it legal again and but we put them in suits so no it's okay they're in a suit it's the same guy charging you a similar rate but it's okay because we made it legal just like we've made bribery legal by keeping money in politics just like we made opium legal by calling it opioids and say yes for pain relief sure keep on taking it no you won't get addicted because these drug dealers are in suits so Jesse Morton is a general counsel for marine or finance so he's going to defend them but listen the way that he that he does he says quote the installment lending industry provides an important service to tens of millions of Americans who might otherwise not have safe responsible access to credit what does that mean what why would getting credit be unsafe I go to the bank and I get credit or I go somewhere else I get credit no he's saying well at least it's not the mob and we're not breaking your legs I mean we're maybe breaking your bank account we're breaking your house we're breaking your life hey I didn't break your kneecap I gave it to you in a safe way I appreciate that okay so now John Lafferty used to work at Marina and he was a manager there what does he think and he says quote it's basically a way of monetizing poor people Jim Baker is a private equity stake holder project person who works there and he said you've got billionaires extracting wealth from working people they found a way for billionaires and giant corporations to monetize even more effectively now it involves pulverizing your life and a sad day for you guiding her and his friends got to make an extra buck okay the companies let me break it down for you great report by the way by Peter whisky from Washington Post the company's other tactics include borrowing money from it for as little as four or five percent thanks to the bond market and lending it at rates as high as 36% well that's pretty convenient if you had access to billions of dollars and you could borrow at 4% and then lend it at 36 you'd make a lot of money too now you'd have to put aside your shame and your principles etcetera as you ruin these people's lives but I guess they think it's a clever business model okay well on the method is among us rivals marine er stands out for the frequent use of mass mail checks which allows customers to accept the high interest loan on an impulse just sign the check it has become a key marketing method every part of this sounds like the mob no it's okay Tony take the money you pay me back later take the money okay and hey doesn't everybody at some point have a problem and they can't get enough money and they're in a bind and that checks sitting there and there's a reason why we outlawed loan sharking and or and and but it's back as long as now it's legal Moreno generally targets people who have imperfect credit scores according to the bond rating agencies after a mail check is cashed by a recipient a marina rep follows up and solicits more information about the borrower this helps in collections and sometime proposes additional lending now they know they're going after people who are credit risk and who are imperfect in their credit ratings and so they know exactly the game they're playing then they call up the guy and go oh yeah what's your information cuz later they know he's not gonna be able to pay not all of them of course but unfortunately far too many of them and then they'll use that information against them while pretending to help them and then they try to push more loans on him so that he'll get even further debt this is sick and you can say well hey look what you borrowed for you give it a 36 or a great business model the mobs also a good business model doesn't mean we should do it he do make a lot of money who the cartels okay more aggressive collection practices that include calling delinquent customers once a day and embarrassing them by calling their friends and relatives god they must be so proud of the work that they do now I'm gonna go back to Tim Geithner back when he worked for Obama and pretended to care about regular folks and their abuses of the financial industry back then he said the financial crisis exposed our system of consumer protection as a dysfunctional mess leaving ordinary Americans way too vulnerable to fraud and other malfeasance now back then he was pretending to warn you he gets out of office now starts running this private equity company that owns Marina finance and he's like oh the regulatory system is a mess at least ordinary America is vulnerable great let's jump in that is his actions if he does not like their business model he didn't have to invest in them and he could at any point take away his investment but he's choosing not to so a former worker at Marina Finance said this most customers do not read what they get in the mail it's just little tiny type J they just see the $1,200 for you that's the main thing that they see now listen to what Tim Geithner said back in the day when he was working the Obama administration remember the guy who worked at Marina finances we know they're not going to read the fine print back then Geithner said many borrowers especially as subprime markets bit off more than they could chew because they didn't understand the absurdly complex and opaque terms of their financial arrangements or were actively channeled into the riskiest deals that is exactly what marine or finance does now and he said oh great we're making money I don't know maybe he wasn't warning us before maybe what he was saying is I can't wait to get back into the market to take advantage of you suckers yeah we're not gonna regulate anything and even if we knew the Republicans are gonna strip away what little thing regulations we did and you guys are all vulnerable and it's easy to target the most vulnerable and and deceive them by putting it into fine print apparently this was his blueprint for what how he would conduct himself after he was in office now I want to go to another anonymous former branch manager for this company he said were there are a few loans that actually help people yes were 80% of them predatory probably now low you can disagree about the numbers and that's just one guy in his opinion but obviously they are preying on people who they think will be more susceptible to this and when they go to collect it is crushing finally that same branch manager said quote I'm still embarrassed by some of the things I did there Tim Geithner on the other hand not embarrassed still president of the private equity company that invested into that company has not withdrawn it and that is where it stands today so I guess he must be really proud of the work that he's doing so yes Donald Trump is a nightmare and that is absolutely true and we warned you about that as well but don't think that if we got rid of Trump that everything would be fixed the system was already so broken through the bipartisan agreement to help corporations and the banks and to screw over the American voters that it made people so frustrated that they put Donald Trump in charge going back to that status quo is not a good day that gives us a system that was so broken it produced a monster like Trump and that is also unfortunately the handiwork of people like Tim Geithner we must change the system entirely we must get money out of politics so that our politicians represent us and not their donors because if they represent private interests this is what private interests do to maximize their gains from you two easy
