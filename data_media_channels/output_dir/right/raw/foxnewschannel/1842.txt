WHAT YOU FOUND AND WHY THIS IS

27
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,239
UNUSUAL IN THIS SETTING.

28
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,476
>> UP UNTIL LAST WEEK ALL WE

29
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:52,777
KNEW WAS HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

30
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:54,446
CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES HAD A NEW

31
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:56,014
LINE OF INQUIRY AND WAS

32
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,015
DEMANDING NEW DOCUMENTS FROM

33
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,349
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

34
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,884
IN THEIR DESIRE TO MAKE

35
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:01,619
CHAIRMAN NUNES LOOK BAD, AND

36
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,087
JUSTIFY WHY THEY WERE NOT

37
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:04,422
GIVING THOSE DOCUMENTS,

38
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:05,590
SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT

39
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,925
LEAKED A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT

40
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:07,725
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

41
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:09,828
IT TURNS OUT HE IS ASKING

42
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:11,729
ABOUT A TOP SECRET GOVERNMENT

43
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,398
SOURCE WHO HAS WORKED FOR THE

44
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:14,999
F.B.I. AND THE C.I.A.

45
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:17,502
WHO IS A U.S. CITIZEN.

46
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,604
WOULD SEEM TO HAVE SOME SORT

47
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:21,306
OF ENTANGLEMENT WITH THE

48
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,373
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES

49
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,175
OR MAYBE HIS BASE OVERSEAS.

50
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:26,044
BASED ON ALL OF THOSE BREAD

51
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,879
CRUMBS AND SOME REPORTING,

52
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,147
I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD SENSE

53
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,114
OF WHO IT IS.

54
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:32,984
IT DOES LOOK AS THOUGH INDEED

55
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:36,888
THERE WAS AN F.B.I. ATTEMPT, A

56
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,389
SUCCESSFUL ONE TO BASICALLY GO

57
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,291
OUT AND SPY WITH A HUMAN ASSET

58
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,893
ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

59
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,694
>> Jason: WHAT ABOUT THE

60
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:44,128
TIMING IN IS THE TIMING ABOUT

61
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:46,631
ALL OF THIS IS CRITICAL.

62
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:49,200
DO WE UNDERSTAND THE TIMING?

63
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,069
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR

64
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,636
THAT?

65
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:51,970
>> YEAH.

66
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,238
IT IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE

67
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,340
REMEMBER THE F.B.I. HAS BEEN

68
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,209
DOGGEDLY STICKING WITH THIS

69
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,578
STORY THAT WHAT INITIATED THE

70
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,279
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROBE WAS

71
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,047
A TIP THEY GOT IN JULY ABOUT

72
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:04,482
THIS SUPPOSED DRUNKEN

73
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,618
CONVERSATION OF A JUNIOR

74
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:10,354
CAMPAIGN AID NAMED GEORGE

75
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:10,788
PAPADOPOULOS.

76
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,624
IF FOR ANY REASON WE FIND OUT

77
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:13,725
THAT THIS PERSON, THIS ASSET

78
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,895
OF THEIRS WAS, IN FACT,

79
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:18,229
SURVEILLING OR SPYING ON THE

80
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,198
TRUMP CAMPAIGN PRIOR TO THAT

81
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:21,699
TIME, THEN THEY'VE GOT AN

82
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:22,333
ISSUE, RIGHT?

83
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:27,839
THAT IS NO LONGER THEIR ORIGIN

84
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,140
STORY AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN

85
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,275
SOMETHING ELSE THEY BASED THIS

86
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:30,642
ON.

87
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:32,744
WHETHER IT BE THE DOSSIER OR

88
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:33,845
SOME INFORMATION THEY USED AS

89
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,980
A REASON TO SURVEIL THE TRUMP

90
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,414
CAMPAIGN.

91
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:37,348
>> Jason: HOW ARE WE GOING

92
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,983
TO FIGURE OUT THE SOLUTION TO

93
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:39,284
THIS?

94
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,919
EVERY TIME THAT TREY GOWDY,

95
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,020
DEVIN NUNES AND OTHER GOES TO

96
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,855
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THEY

97
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:45,223
GET THE STIFF ARM, EVEN THOUGH

98
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,424
THERE ARE SUBPOENAS IN PLACE.

99
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:49,494
HOW DO THEY FIGURE THIS OUT?

100
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:50,828
>> WE HAVE A GREAT PIECE IN

101
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:53,798
THE "JOURNAL" TODAY BY A

102
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,899
FORMAL F.B.I. OFFICER JUST

103
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,434
TALKING AND HIS JOB WAS TO

104
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:57,602
FULFILL CONGRESSIONAL

105
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:58,303
REQUESTS.

106
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,440
TALKING ABOUT HOW OBNOXIOUS

107
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,008
AND OUTRAGEOUS IT THAT THE

108
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:05,910
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS NOT

109
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,246
COMPLYING WITH SIMPLE REQUESTS

110
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:08,947
AND SUBPOENAS FROM CONGRESS.

111
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,248
THE FACT THEY DIDN'T GIVE THE

112
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,149
INFORMATION OVER TO CHAIRMAN

113
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,550
NUNES ALL THE WAY LAST YEAR

114
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,685
WHEN HE SAID HE WAS

115
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,520
INVESTIGATING THE F.B.I.'S

116
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,022
CONDUCT IS PRETTY STRIKING.

117
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:21,259
THEY ARE GOING TO CONGRESS AS

118
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,493
A BODY AND THE GOOD NEWS IS

119
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,428
CHAIRMAN NUNES LOOKS TO HAVE

120
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,430
THE BACKING OF ALL THE

121
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,264
LEADERSHIP AND THE OTHER

122
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:27,298
MEMBERS IN THE REPUBLICAN

123
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:27,799
PARTY.

124
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,601
MAKE IT CLEAR IF THE

125
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,169
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOES NOT

126
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,339
TURN THIS OVER THEY WILL MOVE

127
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,039
TO CONTEMPT.

128
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,207
WITH ANY LUCK THE WHITE HOUSE

129
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:37,542
IS PUTTING OUT A MESSAGE THEY

130
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:38,943
NEED TO COOPERATE AND HAND

131
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:39,811
OVER DOCUMENTS.

132
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:40,445
>> Jason: I THOUGHT THE

133
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:41,779
WHITE HOUSE WAS BACKING UP THE

134
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,314
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AT THIS

135
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:46,985
POINT, WEREN'T THEY?

136
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:47,552
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

137
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:48,853
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MADE

138
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,355
A BIG DEAL IN THE LETTER TO

139
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,390
CHAIRMAN NUNES ABOUT HOW IT

140
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,592
HAD, THIS HAD ALL BEEN DONE IN

141
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:56,094
CONSULTATION WITH THE WHITE

142
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:56,394
HOUSE.

143
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:57,295
CURIOUSLY IT DID AGREE TO SIT

144
00:03:57,295 --> 00:04:01,299
DOWN WITH CHAIRMAN NUNES.

145
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,500
PROBABLY THEY HAVE THE ORDER

146
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,336
TO ACCOMMODATE HIM IN SOME

147
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:05,703
WAY.

148
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,305
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IT

149
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,307
WITHOUT HANDING OVER THE

150
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,509
ACTUAL DOCUMENTS BUT IF THAT

151
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:14,112
IS WHAT NUNES AND OTHERS ARE

152
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,647
AFTER, IT SEEMS IT'S WHAT THEY

153
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:16,848
HAVE TO HAND OVER TO FULFILL

154
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:17,348
THE REQUEST.

155
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,082
>> Jason: AS ONE WHO HAS

156
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,517
BEEN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

157
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:21,351
JUSTICE AND SAT IN THE MEANING

158
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:22,787
AND LISTEN TO THE BLOW-HARDS

159
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:23,955
TELL ME HOW CONGRESS HAS NO

160
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:30,528
RIGHT TO SEE THIS STUFF.

161
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,296
IT IS OFFENSIVE.

162
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:33,931
AT WHAT POINT DOES THE

163
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:34,966
CONSTITUTION COME INTO PLAY?

164
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:36,134
THEY GIVE LIP SERVICE TO

165
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,035
OVERSIGHT BUT THEY ARE

166
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,703
LEAKING -- IT'S PRETTY WELL

167
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,004
DOCUMENTED THAT THEY ARE

168
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:40,338
LEAKING.

169
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:42,907
WHAT IS IT THEY THINK THEY

170
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,208
CAN'T AND SHOULDN'T SO TO

171
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,276
CONGRESS, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY

172
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:47,679
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

173
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,813
>> LOOK, YOU KNOW THIS BETTER

174
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:49,347
THAN ANYONE.

175
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:51,616
WE HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE

176
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,950
WHEREBY CONGRESS GETS TO

177
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,052
OVERSEE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

178
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:56,087
THEY CAN'T JUST SAY GIVE US

179
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:56,521
EVERYTHING.

180
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,822
THEY HAVE TO HAVE SPECIFIC

181
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:59,390
CAUSE, REASON, THINGS THEY ARE

182
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,324
LOOKING FOR.

183
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:04,062
AS THIS PIECE WE RAN TODAY

184
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:06,764
MADE CLEAR WHEN THE CASES CAME

185
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,166
UP, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

186
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,268
HAS ALWAYS HELPED AND BEEN

187
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:10,768
GOOD ABOUT IT.

188
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,437
WE HAVE PROCESSES WHEREBY IN

189
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,805
PARTICULAR THE GANG OF EIGHT,

190
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:14,205
RIGHT?

191
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:14,739
>> Jason: YEAH.
