MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONFIRMATION BATTLE OVER BRETT KAVANAUGH. THE WHITE HOUSE GIVING THE FBI THE GO-AHEAD TO EXPAND ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BY INTERVIEWING ANYBODY HE DEEMS NECESSARY. THIS IS, THE BUREAUS PROBE COULD WRAP UP AS EARLY AS TOMORROW. PRESIDENT TRUMP STANDING BY HIS NOMINEE IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST FDA REVIEW. THIS IS THEIR SEVENTH INVESTIGATION. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE JUST STARTING. I WANT THEM TO DO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION. WHATEVER THAT MEANS ACCORDING TO THE SENATORS AND THE REPUBLICANS AND THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. I WANT THEM TO DO THAT. I WANTED TO BE COMPREHENSIVE. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A GOOD THING FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD LIKE IT TO GO QUICKLY. THE REASON I WOULD LIKE IT TO GO QUICKLY, VERY SIMPLE. IT'S SO SIMPLE BIRD BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR TO HIM AT THIS POINT. Jesse: AFTER DEMANDING THE FBI PROBE, DEMOCRATS ARE PREDICTABLY COMPLAINING IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. BASED ON SOME OF THE REPORTS WE'VE SEEN I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MICROMANAGE AN FBI INVESTIGATION. THERE IS TIME. THE THING IS, EVERY SENATE VOTE MATTERS AND THERE'S TIME TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT EVEN IF IT IS SEVEN DAYS. THAT'S BAD ENOUGH BUT THEN TO LIMIT THE FBI AS TO THE SCHOOL BAND WHO THEY'RE GOING TO QUESTION. Jesse: THE ARIZONA PROSECUTOR WE SAW AT THE HEARING LAST WEEK IS DEALING A BLOW TO DEMOCRATS. RACHEL MITCHELL DETAILS IN A MEMO WHY SHE WOULD NOT BRING CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST KAVANAUGH, SAYING IT'S EVEN WEAKER THAN "HE SAID-SHE SAID." DANA, YOU MISSED THIS, ON VACATION. Dana: I KEPT TABS ON IT A LITTLE BIT. THEY HAVE A THING CALLED WI-FI IN SPAIN. IT'S ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE, THE WEEK. I SAID TO GREG I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED THE WEEK. HE SAID THAT'S A OKAY. NEXT WEEK WILL BE WORSE. HERE WE ARE. SO EXTREMELY COMPELLING ANSWER INTERESTING POLLING CAME OUT TODAY FROM QUINNIPIAC SAYING 40% OF PEOPLE POLLED, VOTERS POLLED, SAID THEY DID NOT THINK HE SHOULD BE CONFIRMED. 42 PERCENT DID. BUT 56% THINK HE'S THIS IS PART OF A POLITICAL SMEAR CAMPAIGN. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER NUMBER. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME MORE POLLING ON THIS. THERE ARE BASICALLY FOUR CENTERS THIS COMES DOWN TO. MURKOWSKI, FLAKE, COLLINS, AND MANCHIN. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN WEST VIRGINIA. THERE IS INCREDIBLE PRESSURE ON SENATOR MANCHIN BECAUSE HIS CONSTITUENTS, A NUMBER THAT'S ASTRONOMICAL, WANT BRETT KAVANAUGH TO BE CONFIRMED. I THINK A RISK PER BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION THIS WEEK IS THAT NOW THAT THE HEARING IS DONE, NOW WE HAVE THIS FBI INVESTIGATION, AS YOU SAID, DEMOCRATS SAYING THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. SENATOR McCONNELL SAYING TODAY WE WILL VOTE THIS WEEK. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU BASICALLY HAVE DEAD AIR PER BRETT KAVANAUGH. PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKING SO PASSIONATELY ABOUT HIS NOMINEE TODAY FROM THE ROSE GARDEN HELPS FILL THE GAP A LITTLE BIT BUT THE NEWS CYCLE MOVE SO FAST. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A RALLY TONIGHT AND HE'S GOT ONE TOMORROW. HOW LONG CAN HE KEEP IT GOING? IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE NOMINEE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TO KEEP IT IN THE NEWS ON THEIR TERMS. Jesse: HE IS HIGH-ENERGY ENOUGH. I THINK YOU CAN FILL THE VOID. THIS MITCHELL REPORT, EMILY, THAT CAME OUT. SHE WAS NONPARTISAN SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR WHO REPUBLICANS BROUGHT IN. SHE RELEASED A LETTER THAT SAID SOME INTERESTING THINGS THAT SHE WOULD NEVER, EVER BRING CHARGES IN A CASE LIKE THIS AND IT'S INCREDIBLY WEAK FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. Emily: MULTIPLE THINGS ABOUT THE REPORT. FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE ALREADY HEARING BACKLASH THAT SHE SHOULD MENDED A REPORT WHICH I FIND PREPOSTEROUS. WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO? TEXT FROM THE PLANE? THIS WAS OUTSOURCED BY THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS FOR HER TO DO A JOB. OF COURSE SHE'S GOING TO ISSUE A REPORT. I'M ALSO HEARING A LOT OF BACKLASH FROM OTHER PROSECUTOR SAYING THIS WASN'T A PROPER INVESTIGATION AND THAT'S NOT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS SHE DID THE ABSOLUTE BEST WITH WHAT SHE WAS GIVEN AND THE INVESTIGATION IN THAT CLOSED WORLD. SHE USED A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE STANDARD WHICH IS THE LOWEST. TO BRING CHARGES AS A PROSECUTOR, THE STANDARD FOR THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE REASONABLE BELIEF THAT THE CHARGES ARE SUPPORTED BY PROBABLE CAUSE. AND THEN ALSO ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE SUPPORTED AND IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. SHE USED THE LOWEST POSSIBLE STANDARD, GETTING THE LOWEST BAR TO CROSS SO FAR TO INSUFFICIENT. I FOUND THE REPORT DETAILING AND THAT SHE SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE CREDENCE THAN SHE IS. Jesse: ARE THE DEMOCRATS OUT OF BULLETS? WE'VE HAD HEARING AFTER HEARING GRADY HAS PRODUCED MORE DOCUMENTS AND ANSWERED MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANY SUPREME COURT NOMINEE IN HISTORY AND NOW WE HAVE A SEVENTH FBI BACKGROUND CHECK. IS IT GOING TO BE ENOUGH? Juan: CHECK YOUR HISTORY. WE'VE HAD LONGER CONFIRMATION BATTLES IN OUR HISTORY. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE, I'M AMAZED AT WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT THIS PROSECUTOR FROM ARIZONA NOT BEING PARTISAN. SHE WAS BROUGHT IN BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL MALE REPUBLICANS AND SHE WAS BROUGHT IN BY THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, I DEFINITION Jesse: DOES THAT MAKE HER PARTISAN? Juan: YES, IT DIES. AS I RECALL, LINDSEY GRAHAM CUT HER OFF BECAUSE HE THOUGHT SHE WASN'T BEING EFFECTIVE AND NOW SHE DECIDED SHE'S GOING TO REDEEM HERSELF WITH THE REPUBLICAN BUDDIES BY ISSUING THIS REPORT WHICH HAS NO STANDING BECAUSE IT WASN'T BASED ON ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION BASED ON WHAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GATHER AT THE HEARING. Jesse: THE KEY POINT FROM DEMOCRATS, THE DEAL LIKE THIS WOMAN AND SHE DID A NICE JOB. GENTLE AND PROFESSIONAL. Juan: THE DEMOCRATS. BUT HERE'S THE THING, THE KEY POINT IS YOU LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS THAT DANA REFERRED TO. LOOK AT THE FOX POLLING, QUINNIPIAC, YOU LOOK AT HARRIS, HARVARD, IT'S ALL THE SAME. PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE KAVANAUGH. THEY DO BELIEVE HER. Dana: NO, THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION. UNLESS YOU SAW A DIFFERENT POLL. THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION ASKED. Juan: THE FOX POLL HAS 50 PERCENT DO NOT CONFIRM. 36% BELIEVE FORD , NOT KAVANAUGH. IT'S BECOME TRIBAL. YOU SEE AN UPTICK IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE BACKING KAVANAUGH. THEY DIDN'T ACT KAVANAUGH TO THE EXTENT THEY BACKED NEIL GORSUCH. THIS IS NOT A POPULAR NOMINEE. IN THE MIDST OF THE TRIBAL WARFARE, IT TAKES UP. IT TAKES UP AMONG DEMOCRATS AS WELL. THE KEY QUESTION FOR ME, IN TERMS OF WHEN WE GO FORWARD, WHAT'S THE STANDARD? NOW THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE WHO KNEW KAVANAUGH EITHER IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE AND THEY ARE SAYING HE WASN'T FORTHCOMING AND TRUTHFUL ABOUT HIS DRINKING. IF YOU HOLD TO THE STANDARD, AND I ARE GOING TO GET DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO SAY THIS IS A MATTER OF CHARACTER FOR SOMEONE WE ARE PUTTING ON THE COURT FOR A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AND WAS LYING ABOUT WINKING. Jesse: NO ONE LIED ABOUT DRINKING. YOU WANT TO USE THE DRINKING STANDARD, TED KENNEDY COMES TO MIND. Greg: I HATE THAT WE ARE USING POLLING TO GAUGE SOMEONE'S INNOCENCE. THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW. THIS IS NOW THE COLISEUM IN WHICH WE TURN TO THE CROWD, GAVE THE THUMBS-UP OR THUMBS DOWN. THEY DIDN'T JUST MOVE THE GOALPOST HERE. THEY TURNED OVER THE GAMEBOARD BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WERE IN TROUBLE. IF HE IS LYING ABOUT BOOZE, WHAT ELSE IS HE LYING ABOUT ARGUMENT COMETH CLEAR DR. FORD LIED ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS AS WELL. YOU CAN CALL THEM INCONSISTENCIES. THAT'S THE POLITE WAY OF SAYING LIES. WHETHER IT WAS ABOUT PLANE TRAVEL. SHE ONLY HAS A FEAR OF FLYING WHEN IT'S NOT ON VACATION. THE POLYGRAPH. SHE WASN'T SURE WHEN IT WAS. SHE SAID IT WAS A DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE BUT THERE WERE TWO QUESTIONS. THE CLAIM THAT SHE NEVER GOT AN OFFER FROM THE REPUBLICANS, LIKE GRASSLEY, TABLET MEETING OVER THERE. GIVING NOTES TO REPORTERS. CHANGING BYSTANDER TO NOT BYSTANDER. I WILL BE DIPLOMATIC AND SAY THERE'S A LOT OF INCONSISTENCIES TO HER OTHERWISE CREDIBLE TESTIMONY. THAT IS HOW YOU TALK APPARENTLY. IF HIS LIES ABOUT BOOZE, WHICH I DO BELIEVE HE FIBBED ABOUT HIS DRINKING BECAUSE HE'S TALKING ABOUT HIS DRINKING IN FRONT OF HIS WIFE AND KIDS. I AM SORRY. I DO THE SAME THING. WHEN MY WIFE ASKS ME HOW MUCH I DRANK OVER THE WEEKEND WHILE SHE'S AWAY I SAY NOT MUCH, HONEY. SHE SAYS YEAH, RIGHT. THOSE LIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO THE ACTUAL ACCUSATION BUT SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALCOHOL ABUSE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY ALCOHOLICS BECAUSE THEY COMPLETELY BLACKED OUT THE LAST FIVE DAYS. THEY DO NOT REMEMBER THAT THE THIRD ACCUSER HAS A HISTORY OF LYING AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, LYING ABOUT HER EMPLOYMENT, LYING ABOUT HER EDUCATION. THEY DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER THE AVENATTI BOMBSHELL FROM LAST WEEK WHICH IS NOW THE BOMBED SHELL THAT SHE LIED ABOUT HER BACKGROUND. THEY BLACKED OUT ABOUT THE RACHEL MITCHELL MEMO. WE ARE COVERING IT. THE ONLY REASON WE ARE COVERING IT, BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE'S BECAUSE THEY BLACKED OUT. THESE ARE HUGE THINGS THAT THE MEDIA CANNOT REMEMBER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER IT. IT'S DISGUSTING. Juan: YOU LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT TODAY, THE PRESIDENT IS NOW ENGAGING IN JUST THE KIND OF ANGRY BULLYING BEHAVIOR. CORY BOOKER. Greg: Juan: RICHARD BLUMENTHAL IS A LIAR COME ALL THESE DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE NOT ANGELS OVER THERE. Greg: ISN'T THAT GREAT? Juan: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. TOTALLY DENIGRATING THE WHOLE PROCESS. Greg: UNCORROBORATED ACCUSATIONS. DESTROYING A PERSON'S LIFE. AND UNCORROBORATED ACCUSATION. Juan: YOU ARE FOCUSING AS IF THIS IS JUST ABOUT KAVANAUGH. Greg: THIS IS ALL IT'S ABOUT. YOU ARE WILLING TO DESTROY SOMEBODY OVER A SEAT. YOU CAN HAVE THE SEAT. Juan: I HAVE BULLETS AND ME FROM TRYING TO DEFEND SOMEONE WHEN I THOUGHT THEY WERE BEING UNFAIRLY MALIGNED. I WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT KAVANAUGH, YOU JUST SAID YOU THINK HE IS FIBBING ABOUT THE DRINKING. YOU HAVE TO SPEAK TO A MAN OR WOMAN'S CHARACTER, PUTTING THEM IN CHARGE Greg: A GUY TRYING TO PLAY DOWN THE BEER. Juan: IN THE YEARBOOK, YOU HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEVILS TRIANGLE. Jesse: YOU ARE SELLING BOOKS WHILE WE WERE GOING OVER ALL OF THAT. THE DEVILS TRIANGLE IS A
