00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
hey everyone hope you're doing okay I

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,750
haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video like this in a</font>

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,629
while which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where I don't have an aim</font>

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,269
in mind I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and let the camera</font>

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,639
roll because I have had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,400
lately many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will know what it is</font>

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,920
if you follow me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter or follow me</font>

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,820
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook or just even see my videos</font>

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,800
recently I've been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged with the</font>

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,949
Occupy movements and I understand it's

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,260
been quite alien 18 for some people

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,960
because some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't like talking</font>

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,649
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> politics other people just</font>

14
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,660
wholeheartedly disagree with me which is

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,350
fine you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's not about you know or</font>

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,879
green together<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about you know</font>

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,149
having discussion and coming to

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,980
conclusions actually saying I was told

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,129
about two years ago was when you have an

20
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,710
argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> with someone the purpose of</font>

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,100
having an argument is to find common

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">ground to agree on something which I</font>

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,840
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just never thought of before I</font>

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,250
don't know if you've ever thought of it

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,769
that way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in society that is all</font>

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,600
about winning an argument and holding

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,090
your ground because giving into an

28
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,010
argument as they would put it shows

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,570
weakness when for me I've learned that

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,700
you know not being told that you're

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
wrong but being proven that you're wrong

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,490
allows you to take a new enlightenment

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,740
and direction and with the new

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">information that's been presented and so</font>

35
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,540
I'm putting my cards out on the table

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,060
today to explain where I'm coming from

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,439
with everything that's happening in the

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,030
world and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that you will</font>

39
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,460
stick with me through this video and

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,290
actually contribute your thoughts and

41
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,960
just every point i make you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,549
st. in the comments you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know leave</font>

43
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:42,869
multiple comments on different things

44
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as i said i'm not</font>

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure where this video is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go um</font>

46
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,270
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's quite</font>

47
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,619
a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've learned the past few</font>

48
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,240
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's dawned on me quite</font>

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,950
heavily like I guess I feel trapped in a

50
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,920
way and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why is I've come to</font>

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">the conclusion that the changes I'd like</font>

52
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,300
to see in the world like many other

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,380
people I've met

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm not going to happen the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> results</font>

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to happen in my lifetime and</font>

56
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm content with that now because as

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,970
I've mentioned before I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font>

58
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,200
man in Florida called jacque fresco

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,700
who's 95 in 1974 he was on a Larry King

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,380
interview talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

61
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,270
still relevant today and he's not the

62
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">slightest bit bitter and he he told me</font>

63
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,270
is because if you have expectations that

64
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,970
are too high and they're not met that's

65
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,710
why you're disappointed and hurt because

66
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,130
you expected too much which makes sense

67
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">but at the same time I think is good to</font>

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,190
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> expectations because that allows</font>

69
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,040
you to progress and actually set a goal

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,090
if we didn't have expectations at all we

71
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,830
would probably still be living in caves

72
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,600
but I think I could be wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

73
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">point um well I've learnt with the</font>

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,450
Occupy movement and it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

75
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,130
the Occupy movement but it's obviously

76
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,420
what's in the news at the moment is

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,070
there is a big disconnect there is a

78
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,820
disconnect between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality and what</font>

79
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,190
is actually happening and the mainstream

80
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,600
realization of that whether we're

81
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,100
talking about traditional mainstream

82
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,440
media or people and populations as a

83
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,320
whole you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there may be acts of</font>

84
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,420
police brutality which get put on

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only when it gets onto</font>

86
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,380
the front page that people then react to

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,140
it and you know with rain stream media

88
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,160
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has always been the case with</font>

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,630
anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend Charlie</font>

90
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">McDonnell when he he's the number one</font>

91
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,550
most subscribed in the UK when he hit a

92
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,680
million subscribers the newspapers

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,440
picked up on it two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

94
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,480
later and when one<font color="#E5E5E5"> news story was</font>

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,770
written so did the others they all

96
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,110
followed suit which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so delay you</font>

97
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">know Twitter and social media really</font>

98
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes things a lot more instant and</font>

99
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,620
although I have criticized traditional

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,730
mainstream media people need to

101
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,280
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my main point which I</font>

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,900
probably didn't hit on hard enough was

103
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,890
this that all I'm saying is don't rely

104
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,660
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one news source if that if you have</font>

105
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">your favorite news channel that you you</font>

106
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">respect don't just use it just use even</font>

107
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,010
news channels that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may not like you</font>

108
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,160
know just look at everything because the

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,940
more facets you have of a story that the

110
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,590
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearer the pictures</font>

111
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,820
and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying with that and</font>

112
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,250
what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned about people who talk</font>

113
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,940
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Occupy movement is I feel that</font>

114
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people that disagree with the</font>

115
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">movement don't disagree with the</font>

116
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,010
principles but they disagree with the

117
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,130
way they're doing it so one thing is no

118
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,290
one's elected them so why they speaking

119
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,070
on our behalf I'm part of the 99 percent

120
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,139
but I don't agree with them taking to

121
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,400
the streets and that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,870
associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that when actually you</font>

123
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,620
know the 99 percent is actually a

124
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,380
statistic on finances you know the one

125
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,510
percent being the most wealthy etc so

126
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,040
whether you like it or not you are

127
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,710
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part that 99% you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be son</font>

128
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's taken a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backseat or doesn't want</font>

129
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,770
to complain that's fine but

130
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">statistically you are apart the 99</font>

131
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,680
percent but the people that distancing

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,200
themselves from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you know this</font>

133
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,880
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about discussion so if I've called</font>

134
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,550
this wrong please say but it feels to me

135
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,680
that the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an issue of it</font>

136
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,180
have an issue with the way they're doing

137
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,900
it so they're setting up tap attends you

138
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,300
know they're hippies and all this app

139
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,789
hominin and people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

140
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,010
associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and also throughout</font>

141
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,810
my life whenever I've stepped out of

142
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,940
line out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the status quo to challenge</font>

143
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing like when I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at school</font>

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,570
challenging the system for being corrupt

145
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,050
whenever I've talked spoken out against

146
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,729
bullies who bully the kid in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

147
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,310
playground you get site site sidelined

148
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,380
even by people that weren't involved in

149
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,450
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> place people like old that's a</font>

150
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,950
bit all goods you know and I'm sure

151
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,539
you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> loads of experiences like</font>

152
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,690
that and that's what I'm seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

153
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,970
it's very easy to criticize them because

154
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,560
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different and so</font>

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,910
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask people do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you support the</font>

156
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,220
movement I'm asking do you support what

157
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,229
they're complaining against so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

158
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,500
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are doing tax evasion</font>

159
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,229
companies that health companies that pay

160
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,289
bonuses to their employees who managed

161
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:28,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold back organ donations you know</font>

162
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tucson who needs it and there's many</font>

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
case studies of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people who have</font>

164
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,599
died because there was an organ<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

165
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,450
but they weren't giving it because they

166
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,340
were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back for you know</font>

167
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,689
making profit they

168
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,639
things exist I don't understand how

169
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">people could disagree with this is a bad</font>

170
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,009
thing now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue there for maybe well</font>

171
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">I disagree with the Occupy movement</font>

172
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,489
because they don't have solutions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

173
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,629
the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> point in the movement is</font>

174
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,549
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming together and coming up</font>

175
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,079
with solutions because the government's

176
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,610
have obviously not done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough</font>

177
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,979
job but then it gets into an issue of oh

178
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:06,819
you're challenging you know democracy we

179
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,249
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have democracy or true democracy</font>

180
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,559
you know every government is a sliding

181
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:14,829
scale but then it meet me talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

182
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,469
this I'm sidelining myself even more and

183
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,409
I realize you know my viewership of my

184
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,059
videos lately has gone down a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

185
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:23,229
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because a lot of people get</font>

186
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,300
turned off by thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these</font>

187
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which I understand I made a point</font>

188
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,050
on my Twitter a couple of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago that</font>

189
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,969
I found it funny that mean quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

190
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other people were writing emails to</font>

191
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,059
government and other people supporting

192
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,009
the movement whilst other people would

193
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,319
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked up about X Factor and who</font>

194
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,429
was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there on Twitter</font>

195
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:47,169
everyone's getting involved in drama and

196
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,379
I'm not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well then we got to</font>

197
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,639
say what the question was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

198
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,649
posed to me first they were saying well

199
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't you think people deserve to escape</font>

200
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,050
reality and what shows like The X Factor

201
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,179
and I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that although it makes</font>

202
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,389
me feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad that people feel the need to</font>

203
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,129
escape reality which shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> you there is</font>

204
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's not right but secondly</font>

205
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,119
I'm not saying it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad thing in</font>

206
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,979
getting involved in entertainment and

207
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:13,749
that you know and listening to music

208
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:17,619
watching trash<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV if you want but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

209
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,629
see as a problem is when people are

210
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,269
getting caught up in drama arguing about

211
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,659
who's getting voted off next in that

212
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:27,579
it's like that energy is wasted when it

213
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,949
could be used on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with</font>

214
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,779
real problems and then we get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

215
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,458
point of well there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing I can do</font>

216
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,818
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest point ever is</font>

217
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:39,698
apathy apathy is growing more and more

218
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,029
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> George Carlin may he rest in peace</font>

219
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,078
I've been watching a lot of his stuff

220
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:48,009
lately and he summed it up very well he

221
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,829
says that we've been we are a generation

222
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:54,580
that has been bribed with gadgets

223
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,770
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can say that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

224
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,150
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it better than ever you know I'm</font>

225
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,920
able to do videos like this now I have

226
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,460
two massive screens here i have a new

227
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,690
iphone which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can talk to and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah and</font>

228
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it can give me answers and just like</font>

229
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,520
that but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

230
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,110
system is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and actually this</font>

231
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,960
disconnect this internal looking that

232
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,460
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> staying in our homes you know</font>

233
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,860
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going work your job you keep your</font>

234
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,270
head down you do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you go</font>

235
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,340
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you relax and you spend what</font>

236
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,010
you've made and you build<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in life and</font>

237
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,720
the thing that's been said to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

238
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again is you can work you know what</font>

239
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,860
your entire life and get your money

240
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,140
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know have a pension so</font>

241
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,410
that you've secured money for<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

242
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,440
and also for your family<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then when</font>

243
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you die that money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just goes back into</font>

244
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system and is that really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

245
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,440
what you want your legacy to be because

246
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,150
for me that legacy is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meaning</font>

247
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,760
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life is it's to create something that</font>

248
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,430
can live LA<font color="#CCCCCC"> live and last longer than</font>

249
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,220
you and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want your legacy to be</font>

250
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,210
that to be inheritance I just find that

251
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,160
quite depressing so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not</font>

252
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,950
much coherence with what I'm talking

253
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,480
about this video because I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

254
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,030
so many things going on my head but I

255
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,910
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why do people not like</font>

256
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,370
others getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the street and saying</font>

257
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,430
we want this stuff dealt with because if

258
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,930
you actually look at all the stuff that

259
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,060
it has happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> in society even in the</font>

260
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,760
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year it is disgusting and it's</font>

261
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get worse and the you know that</font>

262
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,810
the best metaphor is a frog in boiling

263
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,310
water for anyone he doesn't know what

264
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is if you put a frog in hot water</font>

265
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frog will jump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hell unless it's a</font>

266
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,890
really big bow and I can't jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell</font>

267
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll try to don't even though I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

268
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,760
that I was a completely pointless point

269
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,740
destroying the metaphor already but if

270
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,350
you put a frog in warm water and you

271
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,810
heat up slowly it won't try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it</font>

272
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,310
won't notice it and that is what's

273
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening in society we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> losing out</font>

274
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,339
to apathy and so I see people

275
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">criticizing the Occupy movements and by</font>

276
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,680
no means<font color="#E5E5E5"> am I saying it's a flawless</font>

277
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,240
movement there's criticisms I have a bit

278
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've said criticisms aren't a bad</font>

279
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,779
thing but when people are saying they

280
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,180
should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get jobs and they're just</font>

281
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">hippies and they're just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Communists and</font>

282
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,050
socialists all this name-calling again

283
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,389
George Carlin said that the way that

284
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,029
society is constructed is in three tiers

285
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,910
you have the rich people who keep all

286
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,329
the money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves and do whatever</font>

287
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:41,490
they want you then<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the middle class</font>

288
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,319
who work hard to make the money and they

289
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,230
argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with each other because again with</font>

290
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,720
the Occupy movement there are a lot of

291
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,180
arguments which is well I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it tough</font>

292
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,550
I work really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my money and I</font>

293
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,230
don't complain so why should they

294
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,370
complain and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a job do people</font>

295
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,410
not understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're fighting with</font>

296
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,699
each other when we're actually on the

297
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,709
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and that's the bit I find most</font>

298
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,279
frustrating is you know you can look at

299
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,230
statistics of how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs are</font>

300
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,639
available to how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> unemployed but</font>

301
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,850
then it's also about mobility you know

302
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,050
there may be a job at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side of</font>

303
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country and stuff like that it</font>

304
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:23,279
there's not this there's not true

305
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,050
efficiency with jobs and you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

306
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,370
technical unemployment and all that

307
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,420
things I may talk about another time but

308
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,399
we're fighting with each other and then

309
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,110
George<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carlin said and then you have the</font>

310
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,829
poor people whose job it is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scare</font>

311
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,569
the hell out of the middle class because

312
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle class would say oh I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

313
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:43,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to be poor and therefore I better</font>

314
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,870
clock in and do do my time and you know

315
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,249
I I I almost went on benefits and I went

316
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,839
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> six months on savings because there</font>

317
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,490
is an aspect of pride which is

318
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,679
completely cultural and I know some

319
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,509
people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been unemployed for a very</font>

320
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,410
long time and that you know they worried

321
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,990
about it so they you know that they

322
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,660
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do it and it's the</font>

323
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,459
majority of people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on benefits</font>

324
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,309
are on benefits because they have to be

325
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,160
and but the newspaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> will pick out you</font>

326
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,230
know that the odd example with extreme

327
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,040
cases of benefit abuse but if you look

328
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,000
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the abuse that's been done by</font>

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,350
people at the top of the chain and

330
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,110
financially they are the biggest

331
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,570
criminals of them all and they are

332
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,400
extracting so much wealth from the

333
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">economy global economy well we're all</font>

334
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,140
fighting with each other and have you

335
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">noticed that the media or notch the meat</font>

336
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,960
it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> their fault but the</font>

337
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,600
argument or that's the sides of the

338
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,010
argument between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Occupy movement</font>

339
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,280
that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> always gone away from the</font>

340
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,110
financially and the Occupy movement even

341
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">though it's that's what it's about in a</font>

342
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,020
in England it was simple so it was the

343
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,900
church versus the Occupy movement then

344
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,240
it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wall Street and</font>

345
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,220
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> America it's the people and the</font>

346
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">police the police are just people trying</font>

347
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,180
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a living for their families and</font>

348
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">they've been blackmailed into staying it</font>

349
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,110
are they going to work an extra day just

350
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,300
so they could have an extra paycheck for

351
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,710
their families they've been blackmailed

352
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,220
into it quite frankly and then you've

353
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,040
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Occupy movement</font>

354
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,210
and the government but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government</font>

355
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,610
are powerless and there are just

356
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,510
everyday I just see reports of

357
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">admissions that the government can't do</font>

358
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,220
what they want to do because the banks

359
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,089
are in control and so bringing this to a

360
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,670
close um because I could talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

361
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,560
forever I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I just want to know what</font>

362
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,330
people object to the Occupy movement

363
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,610
because if it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there not being</font>

364
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,200
any solutions then who asked you who

365
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,990
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the solutions</font>

366
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,320
because if the problem is the government

367
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,510
who have been mixing up with mainstream

368
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,390
media and business how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ever</font>

369
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,750
expect them to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort their own problem</font>

370
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,170
L surely action has to be taken and you

371
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,180
look at any civil rights movement in the

372
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">past and people say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that protest doesn't</font>

373
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,500
work it it does work in his proven to

374
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,450
workers it's not necessarily the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

375
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,339
game but it is definitely a good start i

376
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:19,780
mean we're talking about it now<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

377
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,010
all over the world are talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

378
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,780
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually last week it was</font>

379
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,870
announced that the America the<font color="#CCCCCC"> American</font>

380
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,910
bank Association I think that's what

381
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,000
they called proposed paying I think it

382
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">was like eight hundred thousand dollars</font>

383
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,320
for a smear campaign against the Occupy

384
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,110
protesters and any politicians that

385
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,330
stood by them if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a real issue</font>

386
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,490
then why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and the</font>

387
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,320
truth is because there's worry now and I

388
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,830
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wonder why we can't all</font>

389
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,000
stand together because especially two

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,380
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when I started looking into</font>

391
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,990
real solutions for society I got

392
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,540
demonized and heckled by so many people

393
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it really hurt my feelings because I</font>

394
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,280
was being so careful with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my research</font>

395
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,340
and I've realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually you look</font>

396
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,880
at the people that have done amazing

397
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,620
things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Humanity and I'm not</font>

398
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,210
comparing myself to this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm</font>

399
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">just talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who wants to</font>

400
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">help humanity they've gone through a lot</font>

401
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of trouble you've got people that have</font>

402
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,960
actually done the right thing and ended

403
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,130
up being<font color="#E5E5E5"> killed or prison put in prison</font>

404
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,170
the Wright brothers who create the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

405
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,090
plane they were told by all scientists

406
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,190
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time and people that it was</font>

407
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,990
impossible to fly and so they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

408
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,680
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it like any real change for</font>

409
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,950
the benefit of mankind has so much

410
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,630
trouble and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just worried that as I</font>

411
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,550
go down this route because I am because

412
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,700
once you see it you can't step away that

413
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,420
I'm isolating myself more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

414
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,760
lost a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my UK YouTube friends or</font>

415
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,040
at least I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hear from them as much</font>

416
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,910
anymore because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't</font>

417
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,819
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved with this I sent</font>

418
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,109
emails ages<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago about how you know</font>

419
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,200
internet censorship is is going to be

420
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,030
inevitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the current</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation</font>

421
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know they're making videos</font>

422
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,030
about it which is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i think it's</font>

423
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,010
it's a bit delayed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a few days or</font>

424
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,350
on the day of when congress were talking

425
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,110
about it you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not about just</font>

426
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,670
waiting for it to get bad and going

427
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,150
right now let's let's act we can't we

428
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,740
need to be smart with human beings<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

429
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,780
have foresight we can look into the

430
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,600
future and people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to risk</font>

431
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,030
what they risk their current lifestyle

432
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,740
because they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if they do have it</font>

433
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now why would they want</font>

434
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,380
with a movement which could make them

435
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,030
sidelines and this is why I'm saying you

436
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">just have a discussion and I guess</font>

437
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,760
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I wanted to talk about so</font>

438
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,470
what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

439
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,320
be honest but on my way home from<font color="#CCCCCC"> work I</font>

440
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,220
just had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it off my chest because</font>

441
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,210
many of you will know he's watching my

442
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,810
videos the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> however many years that</font>

443
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,460
coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Christmas I always get</font>

444
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,320
severely depressed because I have s ID

445
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,690
sad for seasonal affective disorder

446
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,550
which is where the shorter days the loss

447
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,490
of the excess of<font color="#E5E5E5"> darkness just makes me</font>

448
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,800
depressed and it's also because I always

449
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,180
have a lot of bad stuff happening around

450
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:35,270
Christmas and I feel really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong now</font>

451
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,220
compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to normal which is so strange</font>

452
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,090
to me because I felt more alone than

453
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,220
ever actually and I always questioned my

454
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,740
son<font color="#E5E5E5"> a because I'm I'm just I'm so sure</font>

455
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,270
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too mean I'm completely</font>

456
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,220
stubborn about if I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always asked</font>

457
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,900
people who disagree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me you know</font>

458
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,580
show me some proper evidence and and an

459
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,470
argument and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing oh I'm</font>

460
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,600
ever seeing when it's disagreeing the

461
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">Occupy movement in its opinion and what</font>
