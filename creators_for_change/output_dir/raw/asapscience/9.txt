1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Pleasuring yourself is common with over

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,835
50% of woman and 70% of men masturbating on

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,195
a monthly basis.

4
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:10,865
But what would you, just, completely stopped masturbating

5
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:11,860
forever?

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,260
after a week male testosterone levels go up by 40%

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,640
or at least that is what a 2003 study found

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,480
Which caught worldwide media attention

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,020
And in part lead to the no fap community

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,020
fapping being slang for masturbating

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,920
supporters of the no fap movement

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,820
also claim improved sexual performance and high sperm quality

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,560
along with feelings of improved motivation

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,300
self-esteem and happiness

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,680
but how valid are all these claims?

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,960
what most media did not mention is that

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,540
while the study did see increased testosterone

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,420
it went back down to normal levels

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,700
on day 8 with no explanation.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,200
other abstinence studies have found no difference

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,240
at all in testosterone levels between those who masturbated and those who abstained

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,240
suggesting that other variables like

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
changing diet and exercise

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,440
which also impact testosterone

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,840
may more likely be the cause for any changes found

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,580
in people who stopped masturbating

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,360
in terms of sexual performance

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,160
abstinence from masturbation

29
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,140
does not seem to improve premature ejaculation either

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,260
after three weeks of no masturbation

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,820
a study found that participants

32
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,580
had roughly the same ejaculation time as those

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
that did not masturbate

34
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,700
and as for sperm quality

35
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,140
it turns out that those who ejaculated more frequently

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,140
had sperm that were stronger swimmers

37
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,520
which improves chances of fertilization

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,040
in fact this is one theory behind why not masturbating

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
for extended periods of time

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
may lead to more nocturnal admissions

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,100
or wet dreams

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,260
as a mechanism to cycle out  old sperm

43
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,220
83% of men and 37% of women

44
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,580
have experienced a wet dream at least once

45
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,680
but the evidence for why is still in-
conclusive

46
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
as there haven't been many studies given

47
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,780
the awkward nature of studing

48
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,740
people orgasm in their sleep

49
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,020
apart from this for men when sperm isn't ejaculated

50
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,580
it can be broken down and the nutrients are recycled

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,660
back inside the body

52
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
Now masturbation addiction is a real thing

53
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
and curbing the habit can potentially

54
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,980
impact your motivation, self-esteem and happiness

55
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,800
masturbation can increase dopamine and serotonin

56
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,440
neurotransmitter release which stimulates the reward

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,880
pathway in the brain

58
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,780
the only issue is that constant masturbation

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,980
leads to constant release of serotonin and dopamine

60
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,720
which leads to our brain becoming desensitized

61
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,960
to these specific neurotransmitters

62
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,400
our brain would then require a higher level of

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,420
dopamine and serotonin

64
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,440
to obtain normal levels of happiness and motivation

65
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,700
so if you stop masturbation you then

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,560
allow the brain to become sensitive to

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
dopamine and serotonin again

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
but the science behind masturbation

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,420
shows that it can improve sleep

70
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,220
reduce stress & pain and improve your immune system

71
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,220
along with sleuth of other health benefits

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,300
which we covered in another video on masturbation here

73
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,980
in men it can even reduce prostate cancer risk

74
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,200
of course these studies investigated primarily the

75
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,680
experiences of men and currently there is a lack of

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,080
evidence to suggest that polishing the pearl

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,380
is anything but beneficial to women

78
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,260
so if you wantto stop masturbating for personal reasons

79
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,260
Go for it

80
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,260
some say it helped their lives

81
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,160
but for most, in moderation

82
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,920
masturbation is a healthy activity with some genuine

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,220
scientific benefits

84
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,060
if you want know even more masturbation's healthy effects

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,320
