so the Democrats had a winning hand in the budget showdown by a 20-point margin Americans said that they would blame Donald Trump and the Republicans well the issue that they were fighting over there was two of them one was chipped well that has about an 80% popularity and other one chip is children's health insurance it's been an incredibly successful program was bipartisan to begin with but now the Republicans said in September we're gonna end it we're gonna hold it hostage oh we're great if you don't know anything about politics you go oh you would like to attack me on an issue where I have 80% popularity have at it Hoss but Democrats okay as you're gonna see in the quotes here in a second and then the second hostage they took was daca so that's the DREAM Act protecting the dreamers that has one poll headed around seventy percent I saw another poll had a popularity of 84% oh you want to attack us on that issue where I have an 84 percent approval rating you have added horse but no what did the Democrats do no and so he caved in now they did a three-week compromise yesterday we broke down the upsides and the downsides of that deal but overall the message that they sent was we are weak and you can push us around and even if we have an issue where we have 7080 percent of the American people on our side we will not fight so what has happened since then well we've got a White House source telling the hill quote Trump wins again they're rubbing it in and another administration eight Democrats caved they're gloating they're high-stepping so here is Donald Trump now in the midst of this tweet he's taking the White House sources and he misunderstands and he thinks the CNN is saying this stuff so but he's bragging about it but so that's his usual idiocy but the thing to focus on is him saying basically haha Democrats God you were so stupid to cave in so he says even crazy Jim Acosta a fake News CNN agrees Trump world and White House sources dancing in the end zone Trump wins again Schumer and Dems cave gambled and lost and then Trump says thank you for your honesty Jim he he's quoting people inside your White House is not saying that that Jim Acosta thinks and CNN thinks you want but it doesn't matter the whole point is they're dancing in the end zone and then Trump does it publicly you didn't have to do it anonymously because he couldn't help himself he goes on Twitter and starts yeah yeah yeah we won Schumer you're an idiot for ever believing anything I said and forever giving Mitch McConnell anything he ever wanted haha and then one more he says in a tweet the Dems have just learned that a shutdown is not the answer so one more just in your face so now we go to the hill for an explanation from Democratic senators why did you guys do it well it turns out and you know where he's putting it on Schumer and yes he's the leader so he takes responsibility but no he has a bunch of cowards in his caucus absolute cowards so we get a load of these quotes one Democratic senator said we went in with a very weak set of cards with 25 people up for reelection why in the world is that a weak set of cards but you have 70 to 80 percent approval on your issue why is that a weak set of cards because you're a coward you never want to fight never ever ever ever ever oh well I'm up for re-election yeah that's not when you run that's when you fight no wonder you lose elections oh really I want to just give it I want to give it to Republicans what kind of a pathetic person does that the kind of pathetic person that keeps losing to Republicans when they have twenty thirty point leads okay if that was it it's all well hey Jenk maybe it's just the one guy oh no no I got a lot more where that came from another Democratic senator said almost every local news channel he spoke to over the weekend began its interview with the same question why didn't demonstrate exceda's you also have this thing called a mouse where you get to speak words out of it so you could make your own position clear how about you tell the local news guys I didn't shut the government down Donald Trump shut the government down who's in charge of the government hey maybe as a any local news reporter who gets this talking point from the right wing you don't know that the White House the House of Representatives in the Senate is all controlled by Republicans do you know that son do you know that oh you don't know oh you do know that so why would you use a right wing talking point against me the reality is these programs are enormous ly popular why you don't want children to get health insurance is that what you're saying you counter-attack you moron but no you've never heard of it you're like counter attack fight what does that mean why is the base so upset at us why do progressives get frustrated I can't why I can't tell okay here's another Democratic senator you can't win I mean look at the beginning of that fucking sentence you can't win I know if you're a loser coward Democrat Party official that's what you always think you can't win he says you can't win McConnell use craven politics by putting one group of children versus another referring to chip Children's Health versus the dreamers no you can win you have over 70% approval on both of those so what do you do here's how you win because apparently that's are so scoped and you can't see it but it's not a matter being stupid the donors did exactly what they were supposed to do they found the worst weakest so-called progressives in the country and they said oh would you like to take my money to be a loser to be a professional loser whose job is to get their back broken by Republicans well yes sir I would okay good here's a millions of dollars to go lose for a living so what do you do you protect both sets of children oh the Democrats that result is that protecting posters of children we're popular on both issues well how come nobody told us that we did tell you oh you're like oh but you're but you gave in as always now it turns out though one of the reasons that some of the Democrats wanted to fight actually had nothing to do with the children had another knew of the DREAM Act till we get a load of this the shutdown battle became portrayed in the media as Democrats taking a stand for dreamers facing deportation but Democratic senators say that was only a small part of it they felt they had to object to the month-long spending bill House Republicans unveiled her last week because it had input from Democrats Oh turns out the only recently one to fight was because oh well I do declare I have had no input at all that affects me the dreamers that doesn't affect me my kids aren't dreamers children's health insurance I'm rich I don't need that that doesn't affect me my power and privileges were trampled upon well then I do declare I might fight a little bit and then give up one moron along those lines Democrats felt the lack of consultation and the failure to address their non immigration priorities were so insulting that they had to take a stand so for a couple of days because they weren't consulted not because of you not because they care about you not because they care about any of those issues but because they felt personally insulted they did a BS Kabuki theater stand for a couple of days and then buckled and one last piece of I keep saying it over and over because they earned it cowardice there was another Democratic senator there was inexorable trajectory towards now my anxiety is officially high it's a week later and what are we doing here you understand that oh the government shutdown is going on a couple days way excited you so I their never gonna fight never okay great let's run primaries against them and we are I mean pick any group you like you picked the Justice Democrats picking another group pick any group you like just primary the hell out of these guys because as long as they're in charge resistance is a joke it's a punchline it's a gimmick they're never gonna resist all they're gonna do the minute this much of actual resist oh my god a local reporter asked me a question this shutdown went on for a couple of days they fold they fold they fold they hold that's all they ever do get them all out they're all bums they're not progressives they never cared about you all they care about is their own power and privileges throw them all out yet real progressives on corrupted progressives if they're taking big corporate money they're gonna care about the stock market their beloved beloved star market a thousand times more than they'll ever care about you what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could
