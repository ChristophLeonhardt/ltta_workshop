1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,570
Almost everything Iran
does on the world stage

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,670
seems to be a reflection
of global politics.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,210
And that extends all the way
to the country’s World Cup uniforms.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,010
International sanctions dictate
what the country’s national team

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,340
can wear or can’t.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,260
Let’s start with the jersey.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,170
Typically companies
like Adidas, Puma or Nike

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,870
fight to sign contracts
with World Cup teams

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,340
and pay them
millions of dollars

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,080
to wear their jerseys.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,390
But it’s a different
story for Iran.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,280
Sanctions have made
sportswear companies

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,710
wary of sponsoring
the team’s uniforms.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,560
Iran ended up signing
a contract with Givova,

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,450
an Italian sports brand.

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,790
But Iranian athletes
and media complained

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,010
that the quality wasn’t great.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,350
The team then decided
to use Adidas jerseys.

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,540
But they had to
buy them themselves,

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,680
instead of being offered a
traditional sponsorship.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,420
They even had to customize
their own jerseys.

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,710
Here in the team’s
World Cup photo shoot,

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,840
look at Ramin Rezaeian’s jersey:

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,620
It appears that his number
is placed upside down.

25
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,010
The jerseys had other issues too.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,910
This do-it-yourself
approach to jerseys

27
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,800
also means team Iran’s
World Cup uniform

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,970
isn’t available for fans to buy.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,030
Now let’s take a
look at the shoes.

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,530
Saman Ghoddos is a dual
Swedish and Iranian national.

31
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,540
He’s a striker for
Ostersunds FK,

32
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,400
a Swedish football club.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,290
And he has a sponsorship
with Nike for cleats.

34
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,300
But now that he’s playing
for team Iran in the World Cup,

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,890
Nike won’t supply him with shoes.

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,700
The company says, “U.S. sanctions
mean that, as a U.S. company,

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,880
Nike cannot supply shoes to players
in the Iranian national team

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,430
at this time.”

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,530
But Iran is pushing forward.

40
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,240
They’re one of the
best teams in Asia

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,610
and are heading to Russia
with some experts saying they

42
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,490
have an outside shot
at some big upsets,

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:00:00,000
no matter what kind of
jersey they’re wearing.
