A TV ANCHOR MORNING SHOW HOST IN ST. LOUIS HAS RESIGNED FOLLOWING EIGHT SUITE THAT DREW A GREAT DEAL OF CRITICISM. HIS NAME IS JAMIE ALLMAN AND APPARENTLY, HE HAD TWEETED IN RESPONSE TO DAVID HOGG AND HIS WORK IN PUSHING FOR GUN CONTROL. NOW THE TWEET IN QUESTION IS OF THE FOLLOWING: HE TWEETED THAT MARCH 26TH, IT WASN'T EVEN REPORTED THAT HE RESIGNED UNTIL NOW. THE NEWS SHOW HE WAS REPORTED TO, AN ABC AFFILIATE IN ST. LOUIS DECIDED TO CANCEL HIS NEWS PROGRAM. HE IS APPARENTLY THE HOST OF A RADIO SHOW BUT THE RADIO NETWORK IS NOT DISCLOSING WHETHER NOT HE WILL CONTINUE WORKING FOR THEM BUT THE FACT THAT HE WENT AFTER DAVID HOGG AND THAT WAY IS SO DESPICABLE ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE IS A MINOR, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE JUST EXPERIENCED SOMETHING SO DRAMATIC WITH HIS FRIENDS AND EDUCATORS GETTING GUNNED DOWN BEFORE HIS VERY EYES AND JUST BECAUSE HE WANTS TO CHANGE THE LAWS IN ORDER TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE, YOU HAVE A SINCLAIR EMPLOYED ANCHOR GOING AFTER HIM LIKE THIS, AND IT IS DISGUSTING SO I AM GLAD HE WAS FORCED TO RESIGN. AS SINCLAIR SPOKESPERSON SAID THIS SHOW WAS CANCELED AND HE IS OFF THE AIR IMMEDIATELY. THAT IS THE RIGHT MOVE BY SINCLAIR, BUT WHAT THEY SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM HIS LOOK, WE DO OUR PROPAGANDA A LITTLE BIT MORE SUBTLE, SO YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO AND TALK ABOUT RIMMING THINGS OF PEOPLE'S ASKED, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT METAPHORICALLY WHILE PRETENDING NOT TO, WHILE TENDING TO BE IN FAVOR OF NEWS. THEY PUT ALL OF THESE CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATORS ON OR NOT BY ACCIDENT, BUT ON PURPOSE. TO HAVE BORIS EPSTEIN AND SEBASTIAN GORKA AND ALL THESE CHARACTERS SO AS LONG AS YOU DON'T USE BAD LANGUAGE AND IMAGERY OR CROSS THE LINE, WE'LL SIMPLY LET YOU DO IT BUT YOU WERE JUST A DUMB OR DRUNK, I DO NOT KNOW WHY HE MENTIONED THE DRUNK THING, WHEN WE EVER ACCUSE HIM OF BEING DRUNK OTHERWISE WHEN YOU ASK US TO IN THIS CASE. NOW I THINK HE IS. IT REMINDS ME OF CHRISTIE O'DONNELL WHEN SHE DID THAT, THE SENATE CANDIDATE IN DELAWARE. SHE SAID I'M NOT A WITCH. WHY, ARE YOU A WITCH? THEY ARE GOING TO ACCUSE ME OF BEING DRUNK, BUT I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY INAPPROPRIATE. I DO NOT CARE WHETHER HE WAS DRUNK OR NOT, NOT ONLY IS A BAD GUY WHO SAYS TERRIBLE THINGS LIKE THAT ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHO SURVIVED A MASSACRE, BUT SOME OF HIS FRIENDS DIDN'T, HE IS ALSO SO STUPID THAT HE SAYS IT PUBLICLY AND GET FIRED FOR IT. AND BY THE WAY, WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR HIM TO BE FORCED TO RESIGN. IT WAS NOT UNTIL A NUMBER OF ADVERTISERS PULLED OUT OF HIS PROGRAM AND IT IS THEIR DECISION TO PULL OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THEY DO NOT AGREE WITH THE MESSAGING ON THOSE SHOWS AND TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU, TALKING ABOUT SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A MINOR WITH A HOT POKER PROBABLY WOULD NOT TURN A LOT OF ADVERTISERS ON. IT PROBABLY TURNS THEM OFF. THAT IS A GREAT POINT. IT IS NOT LIKE THERE WAS MORAL OUTRAGE BY THE STATION IMMEDIATELY. THERE WAS ONLY THE OUTRAGE AFTER IT COST THEM A LOT OF MONEY. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, RIGHT, THAT IS QUITE OFFENSIVE, ISN'T IT? I DO DECLARE, I AGREE WITH MY ADVERTISERS TO PAY ME, THAT IT IS OFFENSIVE AND YOU ARE NOW REMOVED. THAT IS HOW THINGS REALLY WENT DOWN. ONE OF ADVERTISERS THAT PULLED OUT WAS RUTH CHRIS STEAKHOUSE WHICH MADE ME THINK, MMM , RUTH CHRIS STEAKHOUSE. ME TOO.
