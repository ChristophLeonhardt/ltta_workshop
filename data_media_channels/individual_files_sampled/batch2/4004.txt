ahead of tomorrow's special election in Pennsylvania the president flew there to the district over the weekend to whip up support for Republican congressional candidate rick Ciccone the president also used his rambling 73 minute speech to attack the media to praise countries that execute drug dealers and to go after one of his most vocal critics and Congress Democrat Maxine Waters we have to defeat Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters a very low i q individual never see you ever seen any ever seen we will impeach him we will impeach the press but he hasn't done anything wrong it doesn't matter we will impeach him she's a low IQ individual you can't help joining me now is congresswoman Maxine Waters Democrat from California Congress from the president has said this twice about you in the past week I wanted to give you an opportunity respond well you know there is no response everybody knows who this bully is this president has attacked more women more individuals name-calling I mean look at this not only has he talked about Senator Warren called the Pocahontas he called Hillary crooked he's calling me low IQ he called Rubio little I mean this is what we expect of him I just wonder what took him so long and so since we know who he is and the fact that he is you know calling people names constantly and talking about the media in the way that he does and calling people sob et cetera et cetera I'm not surprised at all all I know is this if he thinks he can stop me from talking about impeach 45 he's got another thought coming I am not intimidated by him I'm going to keep saying that we need to impeach him and I am so depending on our special counsel Robert Miller to connect the dots so that he can prove the collusion and of course we've seen obstruction of justice just playing out before our very eyes so this is a dishonourable human being he is a con man he came to this job as a con man I really call him you know Don con man and so that's who he is that's what we expect and I'm not surprised at all it's interesting to listen to your reaction of this because it almost sounds like you and and other folks who work in in Washington don't even it doesn't even land anymore when he does this kind of thing because it has become so Road is that is that a fair we expect to wake up every morning to him calling somebody else another name or telling another lie he has no credibility and so no we're not surprised about him you know calling names and talking about my IQ he might say or do anything it's expected you just mentioned Robert Muller I know that you are below you believe that there probably was collusion there were crimes committed that's a contention you've made you think obstruction has played out before our eyes today the House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee announced very abruptly without consulting Democrats they're wrapping up their investigation it's done and it's over and they found no collusion do you take that at face value well first of all they had no real investigation and who would believe Nunez was working in a credible way to find out what took place as a matter of fact he was simply a messenger boy for the president running up in the middle of the night trying to prove that Obama for example had wired to half the President and so they can conclude whatever they want to they weren't doing anything to begin with it was not a credible investigation and so we're not paying any attention to that at all the president's former right-hand man and senior adviser Steve ban and went to France he's been touring around Europe and he gave a dress to the front now see now the National Front party there that is a very hard right anti-immigrant some say proto-fascist party and he said this to that group but I wanted to get your reaction I she was a really interesting thing this is what he said to them take a listen let them call you racist lesson let's see what's up with us let them call you son of hopes Buddha please enough let them call you nativist let's see fully Zeppelin Atavist wear it as a badge of honor Bhati do command badge donor because everyday we get stronger and they get weaker where the term racist is a badge of honor what do you think about that well you know he's always said that when he was at bread Bart he said look if race is the issue we win every time he's made it known that he wants to race to be the issue he wants us constantly talking about how racist they are and constantly he's organizing people saying that you know we're accusing them unfairly etc we're playing the race card this is his game and this is what he does and we have to stay on some of these issues and stop following some of this stuff that he's doing and that the president is doing they like diverting us and diverting the attention from the real issues I'm sitting here as the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee trying to hold on to the reforms that we have made with dodd-frank that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that mr. Mulvaney is now over there trying to dismantle since mr. Cordray has gone is extremely important we're working on issues trying to deal with the big banks and to implement the dodd-frank reforms that we've been involved in to make sure that we never have another crisis like we've had where the big banks basically took advantage of so many of our citizens with these exotic loans and with these loans that were resetting in a short period of time we had foreclosures all over this country that we had to learn how to do modifications for and keep people in their homes we need to be talking about these issues we need to be talking about the sanctions and why there's no implementation of the sanctions why is it that Tillison had 120 million dollars then spend a dime of it to find out about the what had happened with hacking into our DNC why is it minutia who is the Treasury secretary supposed to help implement these sanctions is excusing himself and talking about oh that's something the State Department was supposed to do this president in my estimation as a deal with Putin where he agreed to lift the sanctions when he agreed that there would be no more sanctions in exchange for that I I believe no matter what anybody else says that that is what was worked out between the two of them that Putin helped him become president in the way that he has done all of the trolling and all of that that he's done and so I'm not surprised about anything that he does and it's time to talk about the issues he can call me all the names that he wants it doesn't make any difference and I want to tell you he is exactly who we know him to be he is Don the con man that's who he is he's a con artist congresswoman Maxine Waters thank you for making the time thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
