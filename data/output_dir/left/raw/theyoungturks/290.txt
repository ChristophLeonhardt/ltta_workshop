out<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a single tweet which is odd for</font>

important subjects but I'm sure it will

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very good</font>

27
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,120
I guess the vote was a positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> vote but</font>

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,879
this seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a delay I thought her</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Brett's testimony likewise was</font>

33
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,680
really something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't seen</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">before it was incredible it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to rely on all of the people</font>

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,320
including<font color="#CCCCCC"> senator Grassley who is doing</font>

54

<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very good job that'll be a decision</font>

00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,610
suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll be making some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision</font>

57
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">soon whether to take a vote or to do</font>

58
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,480
whatever else they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I will be</font>

59
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally reliant on what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> senator Grassley</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and the group decides to do there's a</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> there now he did say that he hasn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what you'd expect Trump to say but aside</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">from that he says he doesn't know if</font>

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,239
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> even end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up having a vote he's</font>

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,010
just gonna defer to Grassley he has no

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,170
advice for him on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colin's of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Murkowski</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">no they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to do you know what</font>

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,819
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do he said very positive</font>

70
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,980
things about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Blasi Ford his</font>

71
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,560
defense of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cavanaugh was both hyperbolic</font>

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,750
convinced the nation that he didn't do

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,090
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

76
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,579
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very careful statement from</font>

77
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a man who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is almost never careful well I</font>

78
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I feel like they inject him with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

79
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,390
tranquilizer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it lasts for a little</font>

while and once it wears<font color="#E5E5E5"> off believe me</font>

81
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,420
we're all know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it'll probably</font>

be on later<font color="#E5E5E5"> tonight usually Friday</font>

83
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,200
nights he goes on crazy tirades or

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,140
Saturday morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> but obviously I'm</font>

85
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,640
joking about the tranquilizer kind of

86
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,870
but the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing I want to add is</font>

87
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,280
like the way he's commenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">testimony from both Cavanaugh and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dr.</font>

Blasi Ford

90
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,130
it's like he's thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

auditioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of his crappy</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">he cried I mean when do you see that</font>

97
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,560
like he did say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed very</font>

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. he's in the White House he</font>
