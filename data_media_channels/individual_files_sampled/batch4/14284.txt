stormy Daniels is back in the news a Trump loving teen gets payback and another Hollywood celeb acts like a dirty backside all of that coming up today on the rebel buzz I was completely shocked to get an AP Alert last night that stormy Daniels was arrested I simply couldn't believe it I thought this woman is a murderer she's an upstanding virtuous citizen who has sacrificed her private life and so much of her time to bring truth to power hashtag me to stormy hashtag me too Daniels was arrested for touching a patron at a strip club which is illegal apparently in the charging documents it states that she was topless and wearing a g-string when she did knowingly touch a patron in a specified anatomical area and that she did put both hands on office on officers buttocks both hands on officers breasts then put her breasts in officers face tan I mentioned that it was an undercover cop her attorney Michael avenatti tweeted this just received word that my client stormy Daniels was arrested in Columbus Ohio while performing the same act she has performed across the nation at nearly a hundred strip clubs this was a setup and politically motivated it reeks of desperation we will fight all bogus charges so avenatti says it was a setup but also says she's been allowed to do it in the past so it was wrong to arrest her so which is it avenatti she did it and was arrested because she was accustomed to skirting the law or because she was set up by the way we're not talking touching as in grazing someone's hand as they pass $1 bills to her because let's face it she's not getting tens or twenties it was for motor boating I can't believe I'm actually using that term here but it's better than a technical description of what happened if you seek further clarity on what exactly motor boating is here's the link so she was charged with three misdemeanor counts of illegal touching of a patron she posted six thousand dollars bail which she probably earned while she was in jail the charges have been dropped for stormy but not to other strippers who were also arrested at the same time so I wonder who and how those charges got dropped and another feel-good stormy I mean story to wrap up the week that teenager in Texas that we all heard about at the water burger restaurant who was verbally assaulted by a Trump hater and whose hat was stolen by that idiot he received a mighty fine form of recompense to recap what happened 16 year-old hunter Richard was enjoying his dinner at Whataburger when Kino Jimenez who is 30 snatched the hat off of this kid's head through a full drink in his face and marched off saying this is going to go right in my effing fireplace b-word Jimenez was arrested and was also fired from his job at San Antonio Bar Rumble fast forward to a tweet about the incident as reported by San Antonio's news for wear none other than Donald Trump jr. retweeted about the assault he also commented on the tweet saying this if someone can get me this young man's information I'll get him a new mega hat signed by POTUS and another into instance of Trump family promises made and promises kept the Hat was delivered and received by Hunter Richard who is no doubt proudly wearing that hat now or maybe he's got it enclosed in a glass display case either way it's nice to see a happy ending to this stormy story yeah man I keep doing that and sorry to close out on a sour note but some people out there just keep going a hundred miles an hour and a downward spiral drunk and somebody has cut their brake line George Lopez used to be a comedian or maybe he never was stooped to a new low even by Hollywood standards in a symbolic gesture that his film crew caught on tape Lopez held a water bottle to his crotch and pretended to urinate on President Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame now though he never actually whipped out his biological weapon the intent and insinuation was there since the video was posted Los Angeles Police Department has been bombarded by calls for his arrest no technically this wasn't public indecency or urinating in public which happens a lot in the city because it's run by a bunch of commies but I don't but there's a legal precedent for pretending to urinate classless uncalled-for and repugnant yep absolutely illegal I don't think so but as TMZ pointed out his intended purpose of this prank probably backfired since he basically just gave the president star a nice little washing the individual stars are burdened with the responsibility of upkeep of their own star so he actually just saved POTUS time and money cleaning it so backfired George Lopez thanks for watching everybody hope you have a fantastic weekend i'm amanda head the hollywood conservative and this has been that rebel buzz for their own if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
