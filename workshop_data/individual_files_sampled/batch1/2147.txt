I was hired to come in I uncovered for Paul Tudor what he was doing in his best I got the interview all the people around him I watched films there were patterns that Paul Tudor was doing when he was at his very best and he dropped them out one of those things I learned from him he risks for asymmetrical returns in other words most investors think you take huge risks if you're gonna have be a billionaire a huge risk to be really successful financially the truth of the matter is these great investors do not take those huge risks the vast majority do not asymmetrical risk reward means they try to do the least amount of risk possible with the most upside he would look for investments where he didn't want invest unless he believed if he invested $1 he could ultimately make 5 off that dollar 5 to 1 now he knows he's gonna be wrong lots of times and so he knows if I risk $1 and I lose I can risk another dollar I'm still gonna be up 3 you follow he could be wrong four times out of five and breakeven still so that's the secret Kyle Bass took thirty million dollars in 2008-9 during the worst economic time in history and turned into two billion dollars in two years how did he do that he never risked more than 6 cents to make $1 if he's wrong keep you wrong 15 times and still make money well he wasn't wrong fifteen times which is how he turned thirty million in a two billion so those are some of the most important principles if you really want to become wealthy in financial terms
