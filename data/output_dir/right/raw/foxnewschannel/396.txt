1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,454
BECAUSE THEY SAID THE SENATE

2
00:00:01,455 --> 00:00:04,090
DID NOT REQUEST THAT.

3
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,625
BRIAN: LET'S BRING IN DEAN

4
00:00:05,626 --> 00:00:07,093
CAIN NOW.

5
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:08,594
I'M SURE YOU KNOW ON ANOTHER

6
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:10,429
NOTE THERE ARE HOLLYWOOD

7
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,101
CELEBRITIES LENA DUNHAM IS

8
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,703
ONE:  THEY ARE GOING TO

9
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:18,404
PROTEST OUTSIDE.

10
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:19,105
>>

11
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:19,438
I DON'T

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,640
KNOW IF THAT WILL AFFECT THE

13
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:21,140
DECISION AT ALL.

14
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,441
>> I'M THINKING IT WILL NOT

15
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:23,175
EFFECT THE DECISION.

16
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:25,211
WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL ME?

17
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:26,145
BRIAN: I HAVE NO IDEA.

18
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:27,112
>> I DON'T GET IT.

19
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,047
SAME SORT OF THING THAT

20
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:32,885
HAPPENED IN THE ELECTIONS.

21
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:33,285
NOBODY.

22
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:36,589
BRIAN: THERE IS MELISSA

23
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,922
MILANO.

24
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:37,723
>> I COULDN'T WATCH THE

25
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:38,791
HEARINGS WITHOUT SEEING HER

26
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:39,959
THERE THE ENTIRE TIME.

27
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,826
I UNDERSTAND THEY WANT TO

28
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:41,160
PROTEST.

29
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,195
WHAT ARE THEY PROTESTING?

30
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:43,662
IT'S ANTI-TRUMP.

31
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:45,831
THAT'S REALLY ALL IT COMES

32
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:46,232
DOWN TO.

33
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:46,865
AINSLEY: WHY DO YOU THINK

34
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:47,166
THAT?

35
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:49,301
>> BECAUSE MOST OF HOLLYWOOD

36
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:49,735
IS ANTI-TRUMP.

37
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,937
EVEN ALL OF THIS GOING ON

38
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:53,672
ISN'T ANTI-KAVANAUGH, IT'S

39
00:00:53,673 --> 00:00:54,073
ANTI-TRUMP.

40
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:54,740
THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE

41
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:55,274
THEY DON'T WANT THE

42
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:56,408
PRESIDENT TO HAVE HIS

43
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:00,112
NOMINEE IN THERE IF HE IF HE

44
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:01,046
NOMINATED MERRICK GARLAND.

45
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:02,014
THEY WOULD BE GOING THROUGH

46
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:03,182
THE SAME THING.

47
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:03,716
IT'S KAVANAUGH.

48
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:05,251
I THINK IT'S A DELAY TACTIC.

49
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,819
THE WHOLE THINGS IS A DELAY

50
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,152
TACTIC.

51
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:07,720
IT'S AWFUL.

52
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:09,154
IT STOPS GOOD PEOPLE -- YOU

53
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:10,289
THINK ABOUT IT WHO WANTS TO

54
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,423
GO IN THERE AND GO THROUGH

55
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,157
THAT PROCESS AND HAVE

56
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:14,560
EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE

57
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:16,161
OVERTURNED AND HAVE A

58
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,630
SPURLESS ACCUSATION COME UP

59
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:19,365
THAT YOU CAN'T REFUTE.

60
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:20,799
BRIAN: IS HE YOUR AGE?

61
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,269
>> ARE YOU SAYING I'M OLD?

62
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,136
STEVE: YOU COULD BE ON THE

63
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:24,570
SUPREME COURT.

64
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,704
>> I CAN'T DEFEND MY HIGH

65
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:26,238
SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

66
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,739
I DON'T THINK SO.

67
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,307
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S IN

68
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:28,674
THAT.

69
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:29,575
AINSLEY: WHAT ABOUT YOUR

70
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:29,842
SON?

71
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:30,476
YOU HAVE A SON.

72
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:31,844
WHAT DO YOU TELL HIM THIS

73
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:33,545
OPEN DIALOGUE?

74
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:34,446
>> I TELL HIM ABOUT THE

75
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:35,514
THINGS YOU COULD DO AND

76
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:36,715
MISTAKES YOU COULD MAKE AS A

77
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:37,749
YOUNG MAN THAT COULD HAUNT

78
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,483
YOU FOREVER NOW.

79
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:39,484
IT'S DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE

80
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:40,619
OF ALL OF THE STUFF ON

81
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,486
SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL THOSE

82
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:41,820
THINGS.

83
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,188
CAN YOU GO BACK AND CHECK

84
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:43,889
HIS TWITTER.

85
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,223
YOU CAN'T CHECK JUDGE

86
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:45,924
KAVANAUGH'S TWITTER FROM

87
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:46,692
WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL

88
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:47,959
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T EXIST.

89
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,061
IT'S THAT SORT OF A THING.

90
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:50,662
ALL THAT STUFF OUT THERE

91
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:50,929
NOW.

92
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,863
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

93
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:53,265
I TELL HIM THAT ALL THE

94
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:53,632
TIME.

95
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:55,033
TERRIFYING TIME FOR ANYBODY

96
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:56,368
THAT YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU

97
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,736
HAVE DONE COULD BE AN

98
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:58,704
ACCUSATION THAT YOU CAN'T

99
00:01:58,705 --> 00:01:59,037
REFUTE.

100
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,338
AND IT STICKS IN THE COURT

101
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:01,573
OF PUBLIC OPINION.

102
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:02,340
STEVE: A WEEK AGO BEFORE

103
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,676
THEY GOT THE SUPPLEMENTAL

104
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:05,844
BALL GOING, EVERY DEMOCRAT

105
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:06,878
HAD ALREADY COME OUT AND

106
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,979
SAID I'M GOING TO VOTE

107
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,182
AGAINST HIM BASED ON POLICY

108
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:10,615
OR WHATEVER.

109
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:14,720
>> IT WASN'T BASED ON

110
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:15,120
POLICY.

111
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:15,787
STEVE: ULTIMATELY, THAT'S A

112
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:16,321
LOT LIKE HOLLYWOOD.

113
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:17,355
THEY ALREADY MADE UP THEIR

114
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:18,924
MIND REGARDING HIM BASED ON

115
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:19,291
POLITICS?

116
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:20,225
>> BASED ON JUST THE FACT

117
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,194
THAT HE IS TRUMP.

118
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:22,561
THAT'S IT.

119
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:23,595
THEY ARE ANTI-TRUMP.

120
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:24,896
THIS FBI REPORT THAT'S GOING

121
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:26,231
TO COME OUT AND THAT THEY

122
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:27,532
ARE GOING TO GO IN THERE AND

123
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,334
READ ONE BY ONE WILL CHANGE

124
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:30,068
NO ONE'S MIND.

125
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,670
I WILL QUOTE JOE BIDEN THE

126
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:32,904
FBI DOES NOT REACH

127
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:34,306
CONCLUSIONS AND THEY ARE NOT

128
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:35,540
GOING TO REACH CONCLUSIONS.

129
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,608
THEY ARE GOING TO ASK FOR

130
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:37,509
MORE INVESTIGATIONS.

131
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,110
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT,

132
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:40,745
HE FILED CLOTURE LAST NIGHT.

133
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:42,247
THEY HAVE A VOTE AND HE WILL

134
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:43,248
GET CONFIRMED OR NOT.

135
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:45,150
A LOT OF THIS WILL HOPEFULLY

136
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,184
BE FORGOTTEN.

137
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:47,886
IT'S REALLY A CIRCUS, THIS

138
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,588
WHOLE PROCESS HAS BECOME A

139
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,988
CIRCUS.

140
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,089
STEVE: WHO DOES THIS

141
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,456
ENERGIZE?

142
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:52,624
BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING TO A

143
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,626
POLSTER EARLIER WHO SAID THE

144
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:59,931
SO-CALLED BRETT BOUNCE IS

145
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:00,398
REAL.

146
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,767
IT'S ENERGIZING REPUBLICAN

147
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:03,101
VOTERS.

148
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:04,669
>> THE IDEA IT'S GOING TO BE

149
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,870
A WHETHER

150
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:05,904
BLWHETHER

151
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:06,204
BLUEETHER

152
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:06,237
BLUE WHER

153
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:06,271
BLUE WAVR

154
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:07,439
BLUE WAVE BUT POSSIBLY NOT.

155
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,074
THE DEMOCRATS' BEHAVIOR HAS

156
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:10,708
BEEN SO BAD DURING THIS

157
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:11,376
CONFIRMATION HEARING PERHAPS

158
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:14,112
IT WILL ENERGIZE

159
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:14,579
REPUBLICANS.

160
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,313
BRIAN: LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED

161
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:15,980
OVER THOSE HOURS OF

162
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,148
TESTIMONY AND SAY HE CAME

163
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,449
OUT PARTISAN BECAUSE

164
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,517
SOMETHING HILLARY CLINTON

165
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:19,984
WAS BEHIND.

166
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:22,320
AND HE CAME OUT VERY ANGRY

167
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:23,855
BECAUSE OF THE SARCASTIC

168
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:24,823
RETORTS TO THESE DEMOCRATS

169
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:26,357
WHO HAVE BEEN TARGETING HIM

170
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:27,392
BEHIND HIS BACK OR IN FRONT

171
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,494
OF THE CAMERA.

172
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:30,628
DID HE MAKE A MISTAKE WITH

173
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:31,229
THOSE TWO THINGS?

174
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,797
>> NO MATTER WHAT HE DID, HE

175
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,165
WAS GOING TO GET VILIFIED.

176
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:34,866
IT DIDN'T MATTER.

177
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:39,037
HE STAYED STOIC, IT WOULD BE

178
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:39,637
NO EMOTION.

179
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:40,905
HE WAS A ROBOT.

180
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:42,006
DOOMED IF YOU DO OR DON'T.

181
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,074
HE WAS IN TROUBLE EITHER

182
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:43,441
WAY.

183
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,310
THEY CHOSE FOR HIM TO HAVE A

184
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,612
BIG VOCIFEROUS DEFENSE.

185
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:49,147
OKAY IS HE TOO EMOTIONAL AND

186
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,181
DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT

187
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:50,581
TEMPERAMENT.

188
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:51,449
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BEEN ON

189
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,118
THE COURT FOR 12 YEARS

190
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,519
ALREADY.

191
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,119
AINSLEY: GULCH DIDN'T

192
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,787
EXPERIENCE THIS BECAUSE HE

193
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,422

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,071
LOOKS LIKE DRUGS OR

205
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:13,504
PARAPHERNALIA.

NOBODY COVERED IT IT'S

231
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:50,441
ABORTION.

232
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:51,108
IT'S A BAD WORD.

233
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,143
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GET IN

234
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:53,878
THERE AND TALK ABOUT IT.

235
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,812
AINSLEY: TOUGH SUBJECT TO

236
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:55,112
COVER.

237
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:56,914

00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:58,349
VARYING WHAT'S GOING ON NOW

239
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,350

ABORTIONS AFTER 24 WEEKS.

243
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:03,854
KILLING LIVE BABIES.

00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:06,023
WE DON'T SHOW ALL THAT IN

245
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:06,424
THE FILM.

246
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:08,659
THE FILM ISN'T GRUESOME OR

247
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,193
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

248
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:09,860
THERE IS HE THERE.

249
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,028

00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:13,898
INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.

252
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,033
THE GUY WAS A MONSTER OF

253
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:17,067
SORTS.

254
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,569
BUT HE DOESN'T COME OFF LIKE

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,005
HE WOULD BE THE NICEST GUY.

KILLING LIVE CHILDREN.

271
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,159
AWFUL.

MASS MURDERER IN HISTORY.
