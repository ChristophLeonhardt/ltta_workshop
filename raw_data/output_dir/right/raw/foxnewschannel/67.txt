1
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,806
>> Martha: VERY INTERESTING.

2
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:08,609
JOIN ME NOW, NEWT GINGRICH,

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,376
FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER AND

4
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:09,944
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

5
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:12,079
HE WROTE THIS PIECE, CALLING

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,916
THIS AN ATTACK ON AMERICA, NEWT.

7
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:19,820
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE JUST

8
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:20,121
HEARD?

9
00:00:20,122 --> 00:00:23,190
>> Newt: I THINK IT'S PRETTY

10
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,291
CLEAR.

11
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,527
IF YOU USE JORGE RAMOSE'S

12
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,995
NUMBERS, THERE ARE AT LEAST NINE

13
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,230
OR 10,000 PEOPLE IF YOU COUNT

14
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,364
THE ONES ON THE GUATEMALA BORDER

15
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:32,566
COMING NORTH.

16
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:33,801
THE EASY QUESTION IS THIS.

17
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:36,203
LET'S SAY WE OPEN THE BORDER.

18
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:38,839
WE WELCOME ALL OF THEM.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,007
THAT PICTURE GOES OUT ACROSS THE

20
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,409
WHOLE PLANET, HOW BIG DO YOU

21
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,211
THINK THE NEXT CONVOY IS?

22
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,412
AND THEN THE CARAVAN AFTER THAT

23
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,081
AND THE CARAVAN AFTER THAT, AND

24
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,783
YOU GET TO THE QUESTION, YOU ARE

25
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:49,984
EITHER GOING TO CONTROL THE

26
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:52,019
BORDER OR YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,053
CONTROL THE BORDER.

28
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:57,158
AS AN AMERICAN, WE ARE THE MOST

29
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,958
GENEROUS, LEGAL IMMIGRATION

30
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:58,759
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD.

31
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,761
WE HAVE OVER A MILLION PEOPLE

32
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:03,831
PER YEAR LEGALLY BECOMING

33
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,599
AMERICAN, GETTING THE RIGHT TO

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,567
BE IN AMERICA.

35
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:08,803
MOST OF THEM GO ON TO BECOME AN

36
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:10,604
AMERICAN CITIZEN SO IT'S JUST A

37
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:13,207
DISHONEST ALLY TO SUGGEST THAT

38
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,409
WE DON'T HAVE A SERIOUS

39
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,410
IMMIGRATION PROGRAM THAT IS

40
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:16,811
LEGAL.

41
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:20,080
NOW THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS, WE

42
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,148
HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WANT TO

43
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,717
BREAK THE LAW AND IF YOU EVER

44
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,386
HAD OPEN BORDERS AS YOU POINTED

45
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:26,453
OUT, THE GALLUP POLL, I THINK

46
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,156
THE NUMBER FOR ALL OF THE

47
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,226
CARIBBEAN WAS 179     179 MILLIN

48
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:32,259
CARIBBEAN WAS 179     179 MILLIP

49
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,293
CARIBBEAN WAS 179     179 MILLIO

50
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:32,326
CARIBBEAN WAS 179     179 MILLIL

51
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:32,560
CARIBBEAN WAS 179     179 MILLIE

52
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:35,129
THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME TO THE

53
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,463
U.S.

54
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:39,400
SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, WHAT

55
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:44,705
ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

56
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:48,542
IT'S A DISASTROUS IMMIGRATION

57
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,212
SYSTEM, AND IT'S A TOTAL

58
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:51,879
DISASTER.

59
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,217
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO STOP

60
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:04,191
THIS CARAVAN, AND, IN THE

61
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,125
PROCESS OF STOPPING IT, WE ARE

62
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,160
LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THE LAWS

63
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:12,166
THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED.

64
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,902
THEY HAVE TO BE CHALLENGED, NOT

65
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:15,569
COMPREHENSIVE REMOTE COMIC

66
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,270
REFORM BUT LET'S TAKE THE TEN

67
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:21,675
DUMBEST THINGS.

68
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:24,178
>> LET'S PLAY THIS CLIP FROM THE

69
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:28,382
VIEW TODAY.

70
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:30,217
>> IS THIS STRAIGHT UP

71
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:30,784
FEARMONGERING?

72
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:31,552
I MEAN WHEN DID HE START PUTTING

73
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:34,822
THE MIDDLE EAST IN THIS?

74
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:37,091
>> ARE THEY WALKING HERE?

75
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:38,058
>> I DON'T KNOW.

76
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,628
>> HE MAKES UP EVERYTHING.

77
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,429
HE WILL TELL YOU USAMA BIN LADEN

78
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,830
IS MARCHING.

79
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:47,368
>> THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE FACT

80
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,436
THAT THIS SUGGESTION THERE COULD

81
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:50,638
BE CRIMINALS AND UNKNOWN MIDDLE

82
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,672
EASTERNERS ARE MIXING IN.

83
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:55,009
YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

84
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,644
>> THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND

85
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,480
SECURITY SAID YESTERDAY, THERE

86
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:02,016
ARE PROBABLY PEOPLE FROM THE

87
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:05,185
CARTELS AMONG THE 7-10000 AND

88
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,220
THEY ARE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN

89
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:12,526
HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

90
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:18,699
HE WAS NOT HER FATHER, AND MOST

91
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,401
OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FOLKS THAT

92
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:23,304
LOVE TO GET TO THE PROMISED LAN

93
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:23,637
LAND.

94
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,707
THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CHANCE

95
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,811
TO LIVE LIKE WE LIVE.

96
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,813
THERE ARE LAWBREAKERS THAT ARE

97
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:36,517
DANGEROUS, O.R. MS-13 MEMBERS,

98
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:42,856
AND, AND HOW UNLIKELY IS IT THAT

99
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:43,924
THEY HAVE EVER DECIDED TO JOIN

100
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:44,224
THEM?

101
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:51,765
>> Martha: PRETTY GOOD THOUGHT

102
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:52,099
THOUGHT.

103
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,634
MORE THAN EVER THEY ARE ARRIVING

104
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:56,503
WITH THE CHILD IN TOW.

105
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,839
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

106
00:03:58,840 --> 00:00:00,000
SECURITY SHE SAID HAS A REALLY
