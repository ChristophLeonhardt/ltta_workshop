I'M ROBERT GRAY, NOW BACK TO.
"WATTERS' WORLD."
JESSE: THE RNC HITTING BACK AT
THE VIOLENT LEFT AFTER A WEEK OF
RAGING PROTESTS AGAINST JUSTICE
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
NEW ANTIFA ATTACKS IN PORTLAND.
>> WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK.
>> IF YOU SEE ANYBODY IN A
RESTAURANT, IN A DEPARTMENT
STORE, AT A GASOLINE STATION,
YOU GET UP AND YOU CREATE A
CROWD.
AND YOU PUSH BACK ON THEM, AND
YOU TELL THEM, THEY ARE NOT
WELCOME.
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THERE
AREN'T UPRISING ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.
MAYBE THERE WILL BE.
>> YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH A
POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO
DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR, WHAT
YOU CARE ABOUT.
>> GET UP AND PLEASE, GET UP IN
THE FACE OF SOME CONGRESS
PEOPLE.
JESSE: TUCKER CARLSON IS HERE.
HE'S THE HOST OF "TUCKER
CARLSON" AND AUTHOR OF "SHIP OF
FOOLS" WHICH IS SITTING FIRST ON
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER
LIST.
WITHOUT THE POWER OF THE STATE,
LIBERALS DON'T HAVE THE HOUSE,
THE SENATE OTHER WHITE HOUSE.
SO THERE IS NO WAY FOR THEM TO
DEPLOY LIBERALISM.
SO THEY ARE FORCED TO GO TO THE
STREETS AND BULLY AND INTIMIDATE
PEOPLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
TACTIC.
>> I THINK THAT IS TRUE.
I THINK THEY HAVE THE POWER OF
THE H.R. DEPARTMENT IN MOST OF
COMPANIES.
I THINK THEY HAVE THE POWER OF
THE TECH MONOPOLIES WHICH
CONTROL ALL HUMAN INFORMATION.
BUT THE PURPOSE OF THESE MOBS IS
TO AFFECT THE POLITICAL END.
IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY ARE MAD,
THOSE KIDS ARE PROBABLY MAD.
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO BE MAD SO
THEY CAN REACH AN OBJECTIVE
WHICH IS GETTING DEMOCRATS
ELECTED TO POSITIONS OF POWER.
JESSE: IT'S ALL ABOUT
PERSUASION.
THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO
ARTICULATE AN IDEA AND CONVINCE
VOTERS TO CHOOSE THAT IDEA.
THEY ARE TOLD TO SCREAM AND
HARASS THEIR POLITICAL ENEMIES
AND MAKE THEM COWER IN FEAR.
>> LIBERALS, DEMOCRATS, IF THEY
WANTED TO MAKE A CASE FOR MIDDLE
CLASS ECONOMICS THEY WOULD
PROBABLY JUST WIN.
JESSE: DON'T SAY THAT.
THERE COULD BE LIBERALS
WATCHING.
TRUMP WINS OUT OF NOWHERE, WHY
NOT STEAL HIS IDEAS AND MAKE
THEM YOUR OWN.
JESSE: THEY NEVER DID A REAL
ASSESSMENT OF WHY THEY LOST IN
2016.
THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE WORKING
CLASS MEN AND WOMEN IN THIS
COUNTRY AND DOUBLED DOWN ON
IDENTITY POLITICS.
THEY COULD BE TALKING ABOUT
HEALTHCARE AND COLLEGE TUITION.
NOW THEY ARE DWELLING ON
KAVANAUGH WHICH IS A LOSING
ISSUE FOR THEM.
>> THE IDEA THE CALF ENOUGH
DEBATE WAS ABOUT RACE.
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.
IT'S THE CUL-DE-SAC OF IDENTITY
POLITICS.
MAYBE YOU GET TO WIN A MID-TERM
ELECTION ON THAT, BUT YOU
DESTROY THE COUNTRY YOU ARE
GOVERNING IN THE END.
EVEN DEMOCRATS ARE LIKE I DON'T
KNOW, THIS IS NOT GOOD.
MOST OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF
THAT KIND OF STUFF.
>> THE DEMOCRATS VERY AFRAID OF
KANYE WEST AND HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH DONALD TRUMP.
HERE IS KANYE SPREADING SOME
LOVE TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE
OVAL.
>> I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.
I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: THAT'S FROM THE
HEART.
JESSE: THE MEDIA REACTION
APOPLECTIC.
>> WOW!
I AM DOING THIS FOR EVERYBODY
WHO IS WATCHING.
TURN YOUR VOLUME DOWN.
NOW YOU CAN PUT IT UP AGAIN.
THAT WAS BONKERS.
>> IF YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO GET A THOUGHTFUL PLAY BY PLAY
AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS YOU
AREN'T.
>> THAT WAS A SHINY OBJECT IN
THE OVAL OFFICE WEARING A RED
HAT.
HE WAS IN FRONT OF MOSTLY WHITE
PEOPLE EMBARRASSING HIMSELF AND
EMBARRASSING AMERICANS, BUT
MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
KANYE'S MOTHER IS ROLLING OVER
IN HER GRAVE.
>> A BLACK MOUTH IS MOVING BUT
WHITE RACIST IDEALS ARE FLOWING
FROM KANYE WEST'S MOUTH.
JESSE: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
>> I DO.
THE LAST GUY CALLING RACISM
LIVES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
A RICH, WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.
JESSE: THAT'S MICHAEL ERIC
DYSON.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
THIS IS WHAT THEY THINK THEY
HAVE TO SAY TO MAKE SURE NONE OF
US TAKE WHAT KANYE WEST SAID
SERIOUSLY.
HE SEEMS PRETTY ECCENTRIC TO ME,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT A COUPLE
OF THINGS.
IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SO
GREAT FOR BLACK PEOPLE, WHY IS
CHICAGO AND THE DETROIT AREA IN
SUCH DISARRAY.
IF THEY THINK HE'S CRAZY, WHY
ARE THEY ATTACKING HIM.
IF YOU ATTACKED A CRAZY HOMELESS
PERSON ON THE BUS YOU WOULD BE A
BAD PERSON.
THESE ARE AUTHORITARIAN TACTICS
AGAINST THE GUY.
JESSE: WHEN HE'S SAYING GEORGE
BUSH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK
PEOPLE, THEY ARE NODDING THEIR
HEADS.
BUT THEN HE SAYS MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN, THEY ARE SHAKING
THEIR HEADS AND CALLING HIM
CRAZY.
JESSE:Y WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
WHERE IS DR. FORD, WHERE IS
STORMY DANIELS?
WHERE IS STORMY DANIELS AND HER
CASE?
THESE THREE PEOPLE WERE GOING
TO -- THESE WERE ICONS.
AND THE MEDIA GAVE THEM THE BIG
HUG AND WAS PROTECTING THEM AND
SHOWCASING THEM, AND THEY HAVE
BEEN DROPPED.
>> THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE.
WHERE IS RICHARD JEWEL WHO WAS
BLAMED FOR THE ATLANTA BOMBING.
WHAT HAPPENED TO GARY CONDITT
WHO WAS ACCUSED OF MURDER.
>> WE USE PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA TO
MAKE OUR POINT.
ON THE LEFT IT'S TO SUPPORT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
ONCE YOU ARE NO LONGER USEFUL,
THEY DESSERT YOU.
STORMY DANIELS IS WORKING IN
CREEPY BARS.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MARK JUDGE WHO
WE WERE ACCUSING OF RAPE.
I KNOW HIM, I USED TO WORK FOR
HIM.
IT'S NOT ABOUT HELPING
INDIVIDUALS, IT'S ABOUT
OBTAINING POWER.
JESSE: AVENATTI IS TRYING TO
CHALLENGE DON, JR. TO A CAGE
MATCH.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS STORMY
DANIELS CELL PHONE NUMBER NOW
THAT SHE DANCES FOR DOLLARS.
>> BOOK RECEIVE OF "THE
REPUBLIC" BY PLATO.
IT HAPPENED, AND THAT'S A SIGN
OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE MAKING THE
DECISIONS DID A BAD JOB.
THEY ARE THE ON ONES WHO DON'T
KNOW THAT.
THEY ARE INSTEAD BLAMING VOTERS
FOR THIS.
WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED AND WHY.
WE CAN'T LEARN ANYTHING FROM IT
OTHERWISE.
