1
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:15,588
Here at the Torkham Border Crossing,
hundreds of thousands of

2
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:18,618
Afghan refugees have been
returning to their home country.

3
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:29,378
50-year-old Shah Jahan is one of them.
He’s lived near Peshawar, in Pakistan

4
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:33,124
for 35 years, where he worked
as a daily laborer and raised a family

5
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:38,346
of 10 children. With them, he’s now
returning to Kabul, the Afghan capital.

6
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,112
More than two million Afghans have
been living in Pakistan for decades.

7
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:51,048
The majority fled during the
Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s.

8
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:54,358
The Pakistani government is now
pushing them to return to Afghanistan.

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,530
Jahan registers his family for
assistance and gets emergency supplies

10
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,620
from the International Organization for
Migration. Like many recent Afghan returnees,

11
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,414
Jahan and his family never formally
registered in Pakistan, and so are

12
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:16,654
ineligible for the $200 per person UNHCR
cash grant afforded to those who were.

13
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:21,614
Instead, they’re given $30 per person
to cover transportation costs to Kabul.

14
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:29,310
Shah Jahan and his family then board
this rented truck with their belongings.

15
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,212
They carry the donated supplies — large
sacks of flour, tarpaulins, cooking oil,

16
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:36,336
blankets and pots and pans — to the truck.

17
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,266
He returns to an increasingly
unstable Afghanistan.

18
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:51,160
On this route, they pass through miles
of territory which Afghan security forces

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,200
and the Taliban fight over on
an almost daily basis.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,744
The Islamic State is also active in
the area, and one week after

21
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,728
Jahan’s journey, the U.S. dropped
the so-called “mother of all bombs”

22
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,928
on one of their hideouts about
10 miles south.

23
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:14,902
With the country's unemployment rate as
high as 40 percent, the family’s

24
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,276
prospects for financial
security are bleak.

25
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,586
The returnees stop at
one point for lunch.

26
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:25,190
From there, they press on to
the west for their final destination,

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,410
where Jahan plans to rent a house.
He hopes to one day return to

28
00:02:29,410 --> 00:00:00,000
his home village in the province of
Paktia, and build a house of his own.
