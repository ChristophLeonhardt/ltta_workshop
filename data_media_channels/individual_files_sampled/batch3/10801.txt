hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle well the four-page memo detailing extensive FISA Court abuse changed the course of what is known as Russia gate also does the Trump administration Syria policy make any sense and who's the real bully Trump or the media crosstalking real news i'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Alex Christopher oh he's a director and writer for the duran calm and we have Dimitri Babak she's a political analyst with Sputnik international or a gentleman as usual crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate let's let me go to you first this four page memo now if you watch Fox it means something and mean something big you watch CNN you might not even hear about it is this a partisan thing or is there something there there to be honest we don't really know yet do we I mean you have Fox which is building it up as explosive scandal is bring down the Obama administration's going to connect Obama to the DOJ to the FBI to the Clinton campaign that they were spying on Trump they were surveillance they were surveilling Trump then you have CNN MSNBC who are saying there's nothing there I mean the the only thing you can really do is release the memo and Glenn Greenwald is calling to release the memo a lot of news outlets and a lot of people from Julian Assange everybody saying we got to release the memo because we don't really know Laura Ingraham said on a show that there's one Democrat who has read this memo which is located in some secret room for classified information one Democrat while all the Republicans have actually gone through the memo and they're shocked and that's a quote they're shocked at what they read not what do you make of all this yeah it's hard to know what to make of it because of the partisan nature of both it and the Russia gate scandal that it concerns one thing we have to say that it we can all yell hash tag released the memo it's it's so popular right now but it's the republican-controlled Congress that can release the memo or Trump's White House that can order the memo Declassified and release it to everyone if they want it released will then release it already stop trying to make a public theater out of it let's see from what I understand they're gonna go through a process and it will take like nineteen days for it to be released okay well that's 19 days for this partisan lunchroom fight to continue okay I mean it we'll see but you know in Demon's one of the interesting things is it all while the new this new FISA bill the 702 bill that allows the NSA to continue this process of surveillance I mean the irony of ironies here because it was probably because of goal 702 that allowed something like this to happen they renewed it Trump signed it where was the debate none well it's there is no doubt that NSA will continue spying and this whole Russia gate story will continue regardless wiretapping of American citizens well what what what I am interested in is when will people understand that this is just absurd I mean I keep my diary they accused Russia of meddling in elections in Germany France survey Italy Malaysia and these were serious American EU politicians saying it was not just some yellow paper you know saying that all Russia could possibly try to meddle in their elections in survey well there are also smaller countries like much Cydonia they're afraid that traffic be right you can convince our viewers right now that the United States and its security agencies are not trying to affect Russia's upcoming presidential election absolutely it's out of the question you know there are such beautiful people there participating you know the story with the Navalny you know is to tell us who he is Navalny is a racist participant in the so-called russia marches so he's he's considered by many in the West's a neoliberal but he's called liberally der of the anti-putin and Putin opposition and anti-corruption Crusaders he is presented to us twice been convicted for fraud because putting up a French cosmic why it's been connected for fraud in shady business deals and he has a problem with French perfume company not with Russian only with Russian companies however it's it's an interesting case when the United States decided to throw there what with the national with a racist you know this is a new technology they did it in Ukraine they did it in the Middle East but in Russia they're probably doing it for the first time which will make this election cycle maybe interesting maybe we go back to the Trump issue which is interesting because for the last week what do we hear about Trump that he's unstable mentally that he's sick is he gonna last you know all four years or eight years get on a scale and show us your way so that you had the whole media even it slightly even fit to be president physically mentally but they give him unlimited powers to spy and surveil they gave them an unprecedented military budget voted both by Democrats and Republicans so you can see going back to what you said the absurdity of it all well let's talk about another blank check here let's talk about Syria mark you follow it probably better than anyone I know the more I read about what the u.s. is trying to do and say the more I do not understand other than intentional destabilization of the country forever well that's what they've been doing for the last six years illegally arming training and salary militants allied and embedded with al Qaeda to overthrown the Syrian government the Trump administration finally after months in ended that Obama policy but they doubled down on supporting the Kurds which are affiliated with the YPG which the US has listed as a terrorist group largely because of its insurgent actions in Turkey against the Turkish regime of but what we're having now demons we have the u.s. throwing the Turks and the Kurds under the bus the same bus well I mean the contradictions the more you look at it the more the contradictions are jarring okay well the problem is that trying to remove a minor adversity who was actually not an adversary Syria before 2011 the United States and the you have lost a huge ally Turkey you know a country at least four times more important than Syria and Iraq the u.s. absolutely already lost you know their policy was self-destructive it not only destroyed Siri it also destroyed their own Middle East even where it will continue oh it's one of the things as if we looked at what secretary Tillerson had to say about Syria which I thought it was like a visit to the twilight zone and can make a whole program on it but the in the there will be a embargo a blockade a sanction against rebuilding Syria the US will actively push that thus the refugees that left that went to Europe will not be able to come back because there'll be nothing to come back to so this perpetuates this problem exactly and will will actually see because there won't be any reconstruction more refugees flooding into here I mean again look so who are the winners in all of this I don't see anyone just because the United States is trying to spite Assad Iran in Russia alternative parties in Europe the ones that the United States and the you hate so much I mean they will be asking these obvious questions and then the mainstream media that you will say Russians Russians are spreading all these news and it is so obvious I mean could you not have seen that Turkey would never ever in a million years allow any sort of Kurdish state quasi-state border security forces whatever they call it under their country a presence underneath Turkey of 30 million Kurds in Turkey there was no way Turkey would ever allow it in a million years they didn't see this Trump campaigned on ending the process of nation-building ending the the process that euphemism of democracy promotion and ending regime changes which he said as counterproductive and destructive to US policy across the Middle East he also said what are we doing in Syria if Hillary Clinton has her way we will be starting World War 3 with Russia in Syria over al Qaeda and this is the Trump administration has completely capitulated to the neocons and they're running Trump's foreign policy Tillerson now said any permanent indefinite US military occupation of Syria their goals are now when regime change once again back to the Obama era confronting Iran because Iran is not allowed to have influence in Syria no matter what Damascus said I think Tillerson should give us a list of the countries in the world that are allowed to decide who their allies are and which ones aren't because it's always complained in Eastern Europe that that countries are allowed to ally with and join NATO if they want but serious not allowed the ally when they run I think we need to explain to our viewers who might not watch the news in the last two days what happened in Syria what happened was a Turkish invasion it is a factory defect the Russian forces have removed themselves from the area that Turkey is actually occupied but it was a response to what to the United States claimed that they're going to create a huge so-called border security consulting the Turks without even consulting the Turks our NATO ally Sputnik International took an interview from the former UK ambassador to Syria Peter Ford who said the fall in which I think is is pretty exact the United States has been trying to prevent Syria from stabilizing itself as a unitary sovereign state now they see a way of partially implementing it by encouraging the formation of a Kurdish statement so there is supposed to it was the Turkish influentially I think we have to explain to our viewers this is a an attempt at partitioning Syria permanently right Turkish attempt and an American attempt right right the same and at the behest I would say of the the Saudis and the Israelis here because I there is again we our viewers have to understand it's very clear the United States has no geopolitical national interest in Syria and they American forces are there are there illegally under international law there was no United Nations Security Council authorization Turkey is violating the sovereignty also understand that they you is making things worse because they're Polish that we will provide economic aid only to the areas which are not under control of the Syrian government that policy perpetuates presence of refugees in the countries like Germany France so next time when Merkel will be telling to you oh there was simply no way I couldn't accept these refugees I hope the German voters will tell her about the EU policy of not financing the parts of the country that around the control of the Syrian government turkey is invading and attacking the Kurdish Canton of African which Afrin which has actually been Russia and protected it wasn't so came over the us-mexican stay we have to go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on real news stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter LaValle to remind you were discussing some real news okay mark you wanted to finish up on Syria guys basically we've got what this Turkish attack on Afrin is we've got a Mexican standoff a three-way Mexican standoff between Russia and the Syrian government on one side between Turkey and its proxies which are al-qaeda and the 31 flavors of jihad it's supported the whole war including the formerly US backed Free Syrian Army on the other and the US and its its Kurdish proxies on the other and they're in a three-way faceoff Russia would like Turkey in the United States to fight to drive a wedge between Turkey and NATO the United States would like the Turks to fight Russia over Afrin Campton because that would help destroy this very fragile essentially falling apart agreement for the stabilization of Syria with the Astana agreement and it further destabilized Syria and this is where we're at it's an extremely tense situation the writing was on the wall a long time we've long argued it was gonna happen and the hours and days ahead what aragon actually does how much damage he does in syria and whether he will then turned on the american-backed kurds is is up in the air you know the interesting thing is is that one has to wonder where turkish soldiers go do they stay or do they you know or do you know do they have you know it's like the russians when in had a mission said mission accomplished very limited aims I did what they wanted to do and basically withdrew well the Turks stay okay again the Turks will most likely stay as like Cyprus my impression is that Russia I kind of acquires to the fact that there will be Turkish influence in the north of Syria Russia kind of agrees that there is a Turkish minority there so they have their interest we cannot save Syria alone right let's be realistic about it and I'm not sure Russia really wants to drive a wedge between Turkey and and NATO I think we would like to be in peace with everybody I mean maybe they want to but they don't really have to worry about it because it's already happening anyway task is is who sanctions the u.s. to be in Syria for so long I mean going back to what Mark said this goes against everything that Trump had for this is the first serious it actually an interesting precedent for regime change this is the first time that the United States has sent in troops illegally to a country and then decided it would be a change so it's a nuanced and regime change so they do want sent and what happens to the US force is there once Turkey does go in and set up a permanent camp in the north where does the u.s. go what are the troops go what are they doing there what's their purpose what's their goal what results are they looking to get out they tell you what it is why is the plan is always about Iran they lost they know that military presence there isn't going to inhibit Iran in any way shape or form and they're simply acting out of spite and hatred at this point they want to play that they'll they can't do anything boy against it defend does that play the spoiler so that's what they're gonna do okay well that's word on Syria just you know from a Russian point of view we have a conflict with the United States with the EU so Turkey may be our last you know transit country probably for the oil and gas to be sold to Europe so I think Russia will try to maintain good relations with Turkey despite every Russian soldier that has died in Syria has died because the Turks armed jihadists they couldn't do it without Turkey's border okay everyone's gonna pay a high price for this I just wanted to touch real quickly gentlemen there was a new national defense strategy I think it's the first one since 2011 and its focuses the greatest security threats for the United States is China and Russia I mean an interesting chain change because before it was trans transnational threats like terrorism even in the environment and now we're going back to a very kind of simplistic Manichean world where it's the Russians the Chinese it's like the 19th century again right I think it's much worse than the Cold War and the funny thing is that Trump accused Russia of not being active enough on isolating North Korea economically while the United States Congress put Russia in the same group with North Korea and Iran we have to point out here is that Russia was sanctioned and then they asked the u.s. ask the Russians to sanction North Korea I mean that's really rich gentlemen and the recent talks you know there isn't a discussion in the US Congress on its famous thread Russia and North Korea that's Russian propaganda that sounded to me like ragtag and bobtail that we are going to discuss is women's thread North Korea and Russia okay you go in the direction I want to go to let's talk about what's going on in social media I suppose all of us got that little note from Twitter I did Alex did you get one you didn't get one I didn't get Wow did you get one they probably gave up on me I didn't get this you know what I would suggest to our viewers anyone that got that I think almost 700,000 B 700,000 people Gollywood i suggest to our viewers is all of them just go to the internet look up the US constitution and copy the first amendment paste it and send it right back to Twitter thank you very much I know at my first-amendment my freedom of speech rights are I don't need a company like Twitter to tell me what free speech is what I should read and what I shouldn't read well going to Twitter and Facebook are now almost working in unison and I think we know the forces behind Twitter and Facebook that are pushing them to do this and so Twitter is is basically saying look we know that there's we know from all the evidence that there are Russian trolls and Russian influence to initially absolutely yeah so there so their message was awarding to people it was it was very creepy very big brother it was creepy you know it's like we know that you're following certain Russian trails you're watching you but be careful you may have like something that a Russian or potentially Russian linked person face maybe on the other hat Facebook on the other hand is going to do this they're going to rank and they're going to rate reputable quote reputable news sources and they're going to make sure their readers get to these reputable news sources while the other unreadable news sources the ones they don't want you to read just kind of how will fade away just disappear they tell us how this is this process is going to be done I mean is there any transparency here or is it just trust me algorithms conducted an internal investigation into the Russian influence on the UK referendum and found out that Russia spent oh Jesus 0.97 cents on the adverts targeting the UK referendum so Russia meddled for just one euro and that was table meddling Barrack Obama went to London spoke in favor of their stabled and it was not many he was just there well I think it's all Western media and I look at Europe and I look in the United States Canada all of them supported Hillary Clinton but that wasn't meddling that wasn't meddling came out it said she supported Hillary Clinton Berg said it multiple times Twitter okay fair enough they've sent out a letter to everyone you may have liked something that a Russian posted on the internet that's fair enough Jack what I want to know jack is will I get an email that will tell me that I may have potentially liked something that an American propaganda agent of influence posted maybe an Israeli the EU a Saudi I'd really like you know sorry maybe George Soros Pierre Omidyar the other techni guards right Jeff Bezos the did Jeff Bezos influence that he did he get anything on my Twitter feed that may have influenced me I this you guys what are you just a branch of the u.s. government we're concerned about this and it's because we are in media here what is the impact Alex is it just impacting people like us that are very rigid in constitutionalist when it comes to freedom of speech or because my concern of men said this a number times on this program is that they're damaging their own business model am I right or am I wrong or it doesn't really matter I think there's a debate there how much damage is gonna do to their business model because if you take Twitter but not even so much Twitter I would say Facebook and Google we haven't mentioned Google is doing a lot of the same practices that Facebook is doing there they're actually much more advanced than Facebook in us to be honest and they own Instagram the own whatsapp your Facebook and Google owns a variety of properties and they control 80% of the advertising Facebook and Google alone on the internet Lee globally now what they what they do to a website an alternative website a website that's just getting started or is or is not as big as say the New York Times or The Washington Post Facebook and Google have the means to either make your site grow very large very large or they have the means to completely shut you down and no one's going to be able to find you if you can't find the website via Google or Facebook you're riding in the dark you're lost you're lost so this is a very serious issue and of course you can say they're private companies and they have the right to do whatever they want and they have become Utila exactly I was I was going right I agree but they've got gotten to the point where they become utilities and if they continue this they need to undergo some sort of regulation because but Alex you know he had Standard Oil and there was a whole populace progressive movement to break up this very damaging monopoly I don't Marc do maybe I'm missing it where is the talk about breaking up these monopolies AT&T that that was a concerted effort this Google and Facebook are some of the most powerful and is that if ever existed for company on the planet they want to break them up when they're right now operating as US government I mean the idea that you would break them up why they're there they're fully cooperating hand in hand with the US deep state there's no reason for them to and I think this brings us Alex brought up the very good point of what the end goal here the goal here isn't even not letting you hear what Artie or Chinese media has to say that the goal is suppress internal internal dissent it is to strangle the alt media both left-right all plans right before I left either way the progressives write anything outside the mainstream anything you know but what like the New York Times in the Washington Post which is by the way also owned by Jeff Bezos the Washington Post what they want you to know right I mean the very slogan question more offends them because it really means question them a question there there is thirty Seconds well thirty seconds I can call the American officials when they accused Artie what did they accuse us off they said they're so in doubt saying bad things about these amazing country of ours well wasn't so in doubt a European thing since the times of socrata it's called the Enlightenment that's what doubt that's what the whole of it was about gentlemen I'm gonna jump in here I want to thank my guests here in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching us here this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules now for the extended version of our program where we have political potpourri demo what is on your mind well the law on their so called reintegration of East Ukrainian territories just recently passed by the Ukrainian Parliament the rather it basically buries the the misc agreements from is because what what is the Minsk based on it's based on the idea that there is an internal conflict in Ukraine so there should be an exchange like Kiev lifts the blockade declares an amnesty gives them a special status in return they remain in Ukraine and allow the Ukrainian border guards be between them and Russia what does the new law say it says that Russia invaded Ukraine the trash is an aggressor that the president has the right to declare martial law on any part of the country that he desires to be under martial law so out of the settlement phase okay so I mean to make it a simplified offers mark Graham the potential for conflict grew exponentially and number two this is a forever frozen conflict because if there is no maybe not even a frozen I'm not even a frozen but if the Minsk framework is gone then we have different degrees of a conflict that won't be resolved this is we've just poured fuel on that fire not only has meant to the US the u.s. not only has the Minsk agreement been written ripped up we must presume with you know the green light from the United States but the US has is already shipping now deadly weapons you know offensive weapons including advanced anti-tank and and super sniper rifles to Ukraine that as has been reported have already ended up in the hands of Azoff Azoff is a open neo-fascist banderite battalion that serves that helped install this regime in Ukraine and serves their purposes kills Ukrainians in East Ukraine and previously the US Congress representative Conyers they were specifically blacklisted right from receiving any type of USA because it was acknowledged that their fascist that's now swept under the carpet and we can we can arm moderate jihadists in Syria but moderate fascists but Alex one of the interesting things is that the United States was not part of this Minsk process Russia is not a signatory to it what are the Europeans doing what did they you know it was their process the government that's a good point I mean have a lot of I mean it just seems a rudderless to me when I mean it is in their neighborhood yeah the Europeans are rudderless absolutely and going back to what Mark said I think a lot of what's happening in Ukraine now is the fact that they were emboldened by the Trump administration's of course in lifting of the of the weapons and and that's where that's what's happened with Ukraine now is you you pretty much egged them on to restart the conflict and that is exactly what's happening Europe has so many problems so many issues whether they're economic issues where they're migrant issues I don't even think they they even remotely know how to do with Ukraine or even have the appetite to deal with Ukraine are certainly not interesting you mentioned earlier in the princess and it's another element of spite from from the US oh yeah absolutely in fact I would even draw a comparison that they're trying to create a frozen conflict in East Syria like they see Russia as responsible for obstructing their regime change in Ukraine with the conflict in the Donbass I see a definite quid pro quo they're nasty wanted that the difference is of course is that these people who needs to create many of them are ethnic Russians or Russian orientated speaking Russian and there's an open border there meanwhile the u.s. is arming some Marxist terrorists who allow terrorists on quote-unquote at least against another NATO member and they have no way of arming or supplying them except by air and and our alienating their own relations with both Iraq and Turkey destroying their own influence in the region out of process is taking chaos theory - you know the steroids here cattivo well remember we had all these talks about Yanukovych been corrupt his billions stashed away in Europe going to be discovered and brought back to the the coffers of Ukraine well they never found any of Yanukovych it's billions you know was acquitted yes they're probably in the same case with Saddam's weapons but what did they find they arrested several billions of dollars of Igor kolomoisky the main sponsor of the attack against Dunbar's in 2014 the de facto master of neo Petrovsky who who actually spearheaded the they have a ukrainian oligarch yes yes so somehow the great democrats who made my done and fought the russian aggression they are thieves and their assets are arrested in wanton so that's the truth about these people right and it's only the beginning because believe me cover moisture is not alone there are other people in power in Ukraine now who have not very clean money abroad of course there's other there's a few parent and going back to your Europe points Europe is an opposite to do anything Europe has is no leadership Merkel you know just recently has finally cobbled together some sort of coalition for a government so Europe is absolutely right as there's no leadership whatsoever so who's the only one that Ukraine's gonna turn to it's the u.s. there is no one else left no one knows left it's amusing because during at the beginning of the Trump administration the the Western mainstream media was heralding Angela Merkel and Germany as the new leader of the free world right where's your leader of the free world now Germany can't even form a government the EU is employs say that if she ran again she would lose falling apart right and Trump it certainly isn't the leader of the free world either who is leading the free world right now Mad Dog Madison McMasters this is the term leader of the free world because that is a Cold War term I think it is it's a supremacist I think the leader of the free world is a good ironic term for mr. macaron for example who just recently friends about about the so called Russia propaganda and in general you know fake news that's what she says it's you the journalists who are the first victim of the of this propaganda it imitates your tone of speech it may even adopt some of your formats but in reality it's not like you in the end it flourishes on the confusion which we have ourselves gradually accepted and of course so unfortunately it reminded me of a manual to assess troops in Russia about subhumans here's what that manual said a subhuman may use the same head the same feet and the same brains as brain as you but he is not actually human he is further removed from humanity than any beast out of both the dehumanization of opponent you know presenting over your opponent and someone who is not human who only works like you speak spike you but who is not actually a human being but not a real journalist that's in matter okay well you know Alex I wanna continue because there's one story I know that you really enjoyed much Trump's favorite fake news it was a little you know came a little late to imperfect 2017 but nonetheless I thought it was pretty spot-on actually yeah I mean you know Trump delayed it a good couple of weeks and when he finally got it out he actually broke the internet yes the GOP website because you know he said that that tweeted everyone rush did to see who are the top ten you know fake news winners or losers I guess you could say according to trump and of course the staff and you know I think Trump called it correctly I mean he blasted Krugman he wasn't you know the top spot because Krugman was calling about all this doom and gloom on the economy and everything would fall apart and as we know that Nasdaq now is yeah I mean it's it's a thousand twenty six thousand everything's gone down we'll keep getting published in exact times oh there's no downside of being wrong when you write for the mainstream media absolutely and of course we go back to our previous discussion where you know we see on the one hand you know Trump being demonized by the media then Trump demonizing the media and of course you know they say he's incompetent he says they're fake news but on the other hand you have the face of surveillance you have you know the intervention at Syria you have you know all these all these you know how is that there you know between all these things going on you know the you know the shutting down of the government I mean all these issues here and they were arguing what is Donald Trump's true height yeah no because no they index it I mean if you know that with your Heights and waiting they can tell you to what level you're obese and all that I mean I saw that that presser like the doctor it was like I did Kubrick you know Stanley Kubrick did he make that because that's what it looked like to me I mean it just like unbelievable this is what they're talking about when we have five so we have Syria we have all these things going on and that's what they want to talk about now the rest of the world is watching in shock and shower yeah at the annual now annual shutdown of the bankrupt 19 trillion dollar in that US government that is so consumed that partisan bickering they can't even they can't even agree on a budget even even though it will certainly be one one and a half trillion dollars over budget and this is the the model of politics that the rest of the world is supposed to look to and adopt whether by clapping for me the irony is that I mean they've used this all daca issue and so they're willing to shut down the government for the protection of people that are not even citizens of the country Alex can you explain that to me it's I think it's impossible to explain it is absolute but you know if you look at the deal even even even a partisan deal was brought to trump it was Graham and and I forgot who the other congressman was but it was a partisan deal that was brought to trump which basically said look we're gonna we're going to give you everything you want but please you know saved and even then when Trump was was debating okay this is something that we can work with and he had this big you know press where he had all the all the senators there everyone was working together even in the end they couldn't cope with the deal which to me says they don't really want a deal I don't think they well I don't think the Democrats want a I just think they're using daca to hang it over Trump and to shut down the government because there were a lot of forces at work trying to find a solution to this and nothing was found I just think it's a pity that if we're gonna shut the US government down it's a it's a pity we can't shut down all the the foreign military hundred plus military bases scattered around the world why can't we shut some of that down go to the story you know when Krugman next day after Trump's election wrote in The New York Times we thought they knew the society that we lived in we didn't know it he didn't know that he was actually quoting Yuri Andropov you know when he came to power his first his first request was to the sociologist to find out what people really thought about him you know because he said we think we knew the society that word everything we don't know it well Krugman quoted and drove off without even understanding it yeah well then people like Krugman they they live in their own little bubble not as a problem with Washington today gentlemen we've run out of time I hope our viewers have enjoyed this part of our extended version of the program and we'll see you next week remember across stock rolls you
