I must show a couple days ago we discussed the effort to that's been going on for quite some time now to erase our national history and to indict the heroic figures who built our civilization and I pointed out that while the Pioneers explorers conquerors settlers pilgrims founders were not perfect by any stretch of the imagination they still accomplish great things and many of them were great people and so we should look to them admire them honor them and yes build statues to them and everything and I also pointed out that while we hold you know these western figures to this modern standard we hold them to a modern standard especially on on racial issues that we spit on their graves graves if they don't live up to it while we do that you don't find that in any other country in any other code that's not going on any other country or culture it's only in the West they're not doing the same thing with their own heritage and their own historic heroes and we don't expect them to so I went to on the show I went into extensive detail just as an example talking about how many Native American tribes and civilizations were unspeakably brutal murderous in some cases cannibalistic they raped enslaved destroyed you know human sacrifices so on and so forth yet nobody would ever tell a Native American not to be proud of their heritage and nobody would tell them not to honor their historical heroes their historical figures that only happens in the West so I want to expand on that conversation now a little bit and talk about the real problem that arises when we start to do this when we go back and we censor the past and we condemn our ancestors and the people who built this civilization when we start doing that a really big problem happens when we make essentially a cartoon of the past when we make caricatures of our historical figures and we make them into these kind of villainous cartoons there's a big problem when I talk about what that problem is and as an example of this phenomenon and of the problem itself let's talk about this situation with Laura Ingalls Wilder who of course was a famous author in the mid 19th century early 20th century she wrote the Little House on the Prairie books but now the American Library Association is dropping her name from a prestigious children's award that that they be giving out for I don't know 50 or 60 years they've had her name on it and they're taking her name off and there's this process now of kind of banishing her from from the children's literature space because of her culturally insensitive writings so I want to read quickly a quote from Jim Neel the president of the American Library Association he's explaining this decision he says Wilders books are a product of her life experiences and perspective as a settler in America's 1800s her works reflect dated cultural attitudes toward indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance celebration and understanding of diverse communities well geez I mean that's surprising isn't it that somebody who was writing in 1905 would have a dated perspective on something I mean that's totally shocking isn't it and then if you're wondering well what what are these horrible things that Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote there's a New York Times article that describes some of Wilders offenses I'll read a little bit of it it says in the 1935 book Little House on the Prairie for example multiple characters espoused versions of the view that quote the only good Indian was a dead Indian in one scene a character described as Native Americans as wild animals on desert undeserving of the land they lived on little town on the Prairie published in 1941 included a a description of a minstrel show with five quote five black faced men in raggedy taga tea uniforms alongside a jolting illustration of the scene Debbie Reese a scholar whose writing and research focuses on portrayals of American Indians and children's literature says there's this very subtle but very clear fear generated throughout the books and she says it's not appropriate for young students maybe for high schoolers but not for young students so in other words the characters in her books had attitudes that the people in that time and in that setting would have had and that's a problem you see because we're not allowed to acknowledge that anymore we have to hide our children from it in shame we have to we have to shield them from it you think about all the things we don't bother shielding children from anymore mean all the it's like you've got people parents and particularly school administrators and teachers who think there's nothing wrong with introducing children to the most depraved sexual ideas and sex acts imaginable at very young ages but oh no you know an unflattering portrayal of Native Americans and a children's book well that I mean that is just no we can't do that so of course all these books have to be gotten rid of and any person well any white person we should say who may have possessed such attitudes back in the day must be posthumously exiled from polite society that's what we're doing and it's complete madness I mean it is total madness to be doing this and I'll explain why first of all on the issue of historical racism and I know this might be a little bit upsetting for people to hear because I'm going yes I'm going to make the case that for a for a white settler in the 1800s or a or a pilgrim in the 1600s or a you know an explorer conquistador in the 1500s for them to have racist attitudes was not those racist attitudes were not as bad as the racist attitudes that you might find today in other words it is worse for you and I to be racist than it was for them their their their moral guilt for their racism was I think severely mitigated by many different circumstances because you know if you're watching this or listening to this right now and you're not racist well then I mean good for you congratulations if I had a cookie I would give it to you I mean you know go get yourself a cookie for not being racist Congrats you're a wonderful person on the thumbs-up on not being racist wonderful good for you just you should be so proud but that's not an achievement that is not a moral achievement on your part being rate for most of us being racist was never even really like an option we just we grew up in a world where for a lot of us anyway we grew up in an environment where it just never even came up and never even I mean it never even occurred the most I never even occurred to me to be racist they just I just and and if it ever did occur to anyone you also grew up in a society where racism is extremely socially unacceptable and it will be socially punished maybe even legally punished in some circumstances so it was never really never really occurred to anyone to be racist that's that's not the world that we live in so it means you you deserve absolutely no credit whatsoever for not being racist that is just kind of a bare minimum thing in our society so it doesn't afford you the high moral position that you think it does okay doesn't give you the the position where you could stand up on your pedestal and look down on historical people and say well tisk tisk tisk look those horrible people with their racist attitude I'm so much better than them no it doesn't give you that doesn't give you that position um because the fact is this almost everybody in the world up until about 1960 was racist by our definition of the term almost everyone I mean they were all racist the idea of universal racial equality is very new it is uniquely modern it is uniquely Western even now today currently there are many places in the world where that does not exist there are many places where world war racism is still mainstream and most of those places are non-western places racism was and still is incredibly common in some non-western non-white cultures but let's look at this historically prior to the mid 20th century racism was largely a given for most people across the world across the races I mean if you think for a minute that this was unique to white people then you really are just a an incredible fool and I don't mean that as an insult some people are fools and you'd be a fool a complete total fool who's never read a book in your life if you actually think that no it's not just a white person thing even the people that we credit with being reformers and progressives when it comes to racial issues even they would be if you were to take those people and pluck them from their from their home in you know the the the 19th century or the 18th century whatever you were to take them and then put them into 20 18 they would be slobbering backwards insane bigots by our standards today Abraham Lincoln is credited with freeing the slaves well you know what he also he was also in a vowed racist he's on the record saying he doesn't believe that blacks and whites are equal he doesn't want to see social and political social or political equality in fact what he wanted to do is he wanted to ship all the slaves back to Africa now if you were to take that position and Abraham Lincoln is admired by almost everyone as being this you know someone who believed in equality and so forth but if you were to take Abraham Lincoln and put him in 2018 and have him run a campaign on the on the in his King one of his campaign platforms is well white black people are aren't equal let's ship all the black people back to Africa well that no I don't think it would be as I don't think we'd be celebrating him anymore would we by the way Grant General Grant was probably less racist than even Abraham Lincoln but he was also a an anti-semite famously grant issued an order expelling all the Jews from from the areas that he controlled in western Tennessee and again he's looked at as a figure of you know a basically progressive figure when it comes to race and as someone who helped to liberate the slaves but this is how ingrained this kind of bigotry was that doesn't make it okay but it does put it into context we have to see it in the context of the time and so know if everybody in the world is racist and that's just how you looked at the world does that make racism okay no it doesn't does it severely mitigate your personal moral guilt for being racist absolutely it does I mean is it really so shocking think about it today you know we look at the we have a very we have a very global perspective of the world today we look at the world as a world we see and we you know there is no race but the human race and so forth I mean we're all one species we're all one race and it's all one world and that's how we see things and that's it's correct it's the correct way to see thing we also have an understanding of biology and science we have an understanding that historical people didn't have and we also have a perspective that they didn't have they didn't have a global perspective they didn't think of the world as the globe they thought of the world as the area where they live they thought of the world as their civilization their culture so you know in ancient Roman who would have said that Rome controls the entire world well it never controlled anywhere close to the entire world but that's how they would have seen it look that's the world this is your civilization it's the world so for them and again that's not a white it's not how white people saw it's how everybody saw it so for them to come upon a new race or a new world to stumble upon a new civilization well for that process that clashing of civilizations that would be akin to modern people traveling to another planet and encountering an alien species that it's comparable with that so when white pioneers met Indians you can't compare that to you go into the supermarket and being in line with someone of a different race okay that's not what it was like for them it was like for both both sides Indians White's it was it was more comparable to encountering a whole new species a whole new just it's like it's like these people came from a different planet that's what both of them were thinking and you know what if that were to happen and one of these days we do stumble upon some other race on another planet which won't ever happen but if it if it did and we saw that you know they're like us in some ways but they're also very different in others and then we saw that perhaps they engaged in practices that are to us horrifying and incomprehensible and brutal and savage which you know some of the pioneers and settlers and conquerors they would have seen that's how they would have seen human sacrifices and scalping and cannibalism but if we were to encounter that with this we know with this hypothetical alien race who yeah they look a lot like us but not but they're also profoundly different in how they look they're very different and how they act how they speak their customs and everything if that would have happened for us there would be a very real debate among us about whether or not these creatures are equal to us that would not be a given under any circumstance when the astronauts came back from from Planet X and they met they met the aliens they told us about him it would not be a given among all of us that oh yeah well they're just like us there would be a real debate about the moral standing of this alien species and if we were to come to the conclusion that they're you know they're not like us they're we may come to the conclusion that oh they're like animals where we may come to the conclusion that oh they're actually like gods because they're technologically advanced we probably be we would be wrong in those conclusions but they're not crazy irrational conclusions they're kind of understandable conclusions because of our lack of information because we've encountered this mind-boggling new race of creatures and we know nothing about them so we're coming to us we we form assumptions those assumptions might be wrong but considering our lack of information they're also kind of understandable so for people in history white black brown all races for them when they met that's what it was like it was like encountering an alien from outer space it was not immediately obvious to these people to them that the other people were equal and you can sit there and you could say well that's unacceptable they should have known better but that's the key known they didn't know they were ignorant they didn't have all the information you have all the information and you live in a society where racism is totally unacceptable they don't have the information and they live in a society where it's just a given and you know what even though we have all the information and we have all the science we still get this wrong don't we we still even now we still make the same mistake because half of the people who are shocked at Laura Ingalls Wilder for having unflattering views of Native Americans half of those people would look at unborn human beings and say well they're not really people and they have no excuse they have all the information they have the scientific enlightenment and they're still making the same mistake that they condemn Laura Ingalls Wilder for or they condemn the pilgrims for it well guess what the pilgrims had an excuse you don't second thing the other really big problem with this attitude of erasing our past and turning historical figures into cartoon villains and refused it and you know and and and refusing to look at their sins in proper perspective the other problem is that we lose the opportunity to learn from the past and to learn from these people and I don't mean well learned from the past oh you're doomed to repeat it I don't mean that that's not what I'm talking about you know I don't really like that I've never liked that phrase honestly because it carries with it an implicit bias against the past it assumes that number one the only lessons we can learn from the past are negative lessons and number two that the worst thing that could ever happen is that we end up being like our ancestors were I don't agree with that I think there are positive lessons to learn from past and I think that in a lot of ways we would be served very well if we were if we were more like our ancestors not when it comes to racism but when it comes to many other things you know it's kind of like saying well learn from your parents or you're doomed to be just like them which yeah if your parents are bad if you have bad awful parents then that's good advice because if your parents are awful then the only lessons they ever taught you our negative lessons and really the worst thing that could ever happen to you is that you end up being like them but the past doesn't need to be a bad parent the past can also be a good parent and you know if a man has a good father then the advice you get him is learn from your dad or you won't turn out to be the same kind of man so there were a lot of good men and good women in the past a lot of heroes and we would do well to look at their positives so that we can emulate them and hopefully turn out to be like them or at least mostly like them - things like racism that's not to say that we should idolize the past we shouldn't do that either but I don't think there's there's not much of a temptation these days to idolize the past there's much more of a temptation to idolize the present and the future and to assume that whatever is now must be better and whatever happens tomorrow must be better still now that's that's an idol that that is making an idol of the of the present and future and I would submit that that's even worse in some ways than ancestor worship but I'm not talking about ancestor worship I'm talking about looking at our ancestors in context in perspective and accepting that there were great men and women in the past even if they had flaws even if they were racist there were still great men and women and we could learn quite a bit from them we could learn positives lessons lessons from them if we would look at them and stop turning them into cartoons and saying oh they were just all racist so they were terrible that's all they were I mean we're taking these complex people who did incredible things and we're boiling everything down to oh they were racist not understanding that by that logic we have just dismissed everybody in history not just them but everybody if that is if on that basis we can dismiss an entire person from the past then we're dismissing basically everybody I'm the Little House on the Prairie is a perfect example because you could look at those books or a childhood especially and you could learn quite a bit about family values hard work responsibility self-sacrifice yet we throw all those lessons away we dump them down the drain because a child may also learn that people of that time had unflattering views about other races and I find that very foolish because we're getting rid of all the positive lessons because of one bad thing and they're I mean take a figure like someone I personally admire Stonewall Jackson he was a man of incredible integrity in an intensely religious man dedicated to his wife to God to his men he was a brilliant military commander I think the best in the Civil War one of the best in American history one of the best in Western history and we could look to him and we could learn quite a bit we could learn positive lessons from him this country would be a better place if there were more men like Stonewall Jackson in but there won't be because we take Stonewall Jackson we tear down his statues we look with contempt upon him we make him into this ridiculous stereotype of a racist southerner and all the positives that he could teach us we just throw away we just tossed them in the garbage because of the racial issue everything else but also we take that that's what he becomes everything else throw it in the incinerator and we do this with almost every white historical figure we drain the value the educational value out of every historical figure every era every event by making them into easy villains we lose the whole point the history book when we erase everything in the history book and we replace it with sketches and crayon which is essentially what we've done and most people now and most children are being raised to have this cartoonish drawn in kranj perspective or view of guys like Stonewall Jackson or Laura Ingalls Wilder or which wasn't a guy but you know I'm saying to have this carte de sketched in cran view of these historical figures and so we are we are cheating ourselves out of the opportunity to learn and we're cheating them out of the legacy that they have earned through the kind of people that they were and the achievement the things that they accomplished and I think it's a terrible mistake well I'm on vacation for the next week so have a good week everybody and I'll talk to you in a little while Godspeed you
