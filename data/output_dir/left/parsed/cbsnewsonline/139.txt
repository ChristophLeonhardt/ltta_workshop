HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM WHERE SARAH 
WILL BE SARAH SANDERS IS 
SPEAKING. 
>> Reporter: SECRETARY POMPEO 
WILL BE LEAVING FOR NORTH KOREA 
ON JULY 5  TO MEET WITH THE 
NORTH KOREAN LEADER AND HIS 
TEAM FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
WILL RELEASE MORE DETAILS ABOUT 
HIS UPCOMING TRIP. 
ONE ITEM THAT SOME OF YOU MAY 
HAVE MISSED LAST WEDNESDAY IN 
THE MIDST OF A BUSY NEWSDAY WAS 
THE CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR 
THE VA SECRETARY NOMINEE WHO 
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE 
SENATE LAST FALL BY UNANIMOUS 
CONSENT FOR HIS CURRENT 
POSITION AS UNDERSECRETARY FOR 
PERSONNEL AND READINESS AT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. 
DURING THE HEARING, MR. WILKIE 
NOT ONLY DEVASTATED THAT HE HAS 
THE LEADERSHIP AND EXPERIENCE 
TO LEAD THE VA BUT HE ALSO 
SPOKE IN DEPTH ABOUT HOW HE 
SHARES THE PRESIDENT'S VISION 
TO PUT VETERANS FIRST. 
SENATORS ISAKSON AND HUNTER, 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND RANKING 
MEMBER EXPRESSLY HAS  -- THE 
WHITE HOUSE EXPECTS THE SENATE 
TO REMOVE QUICKLY TO CONFIRM 
THAT AS THE NEXT SECRETARY UPON 
ITS RETURN AND UPON THAT, I 
WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. 
DID YOU CALL ON ME BEFORE MY 
HUSBAND? 
>> I DID. 
FOR THE RECORD LET THE RECORD 
SHOW. 
>> INSTEAD OF FOX AND FRIENDS. 
>>> I WILL SAY THAT I WILL TAKE 
A QUESTION. 
>> I DID NOT REALIZE. 
>>> THIS IS A BIG MOMENT. 
>> UNDERSTOOD. 
>> IF THE PRESIDENT WILL TWEET 
ABOUT IT. 
ALL RIGHT. 
I DIGRESS. 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THE 
PRESIDENT SAID, I AM PRO-LIFE 
AND I WILL BE APPOINTING HER 
PRO-LIFE JUDGES. 
AS THE PRESIDENT STILL 
COMMITTED TO APPOINTING PRO-
LIFE JUDGES? 
>> AS THE PRESIDENT SAID LAST 
WEEK IT, HE'S NOT GOING TO TALK 
TO JUDGES ABOUT SPECIFIC CASES. 
HE IS LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALS 
THAT HAVE THE RIGHT INTELLECT, 
THE RIGHT TEMPERAMENT, AND THAT 
WILL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION. 
THE NEXT SUSAN COLLINS SAYS 
THAT SHE WANTS A NOMINEE THAT 
WILL RESPECT PRECEDENT AND THAT 
ROE VERSUS WADE IS SETTLED LAW. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT AGREED THAT 
ROE VERSUS WADE IS SETTLED LAW? 
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 
GOING TO GET INTO ASKING THE 
CANDIDATES ABOUT SPECIFIC 
CASES, BUT HE IS LOOKING FOR 
SOMETHING THAT MAKES -- NEEDS 
THOSE QUALIFICATIONS. 
>> Reporter: IS IT IMPORTANT TO 
HIM? 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>>> IS THERE ANY CONCERN THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS, BASED ON 
OVER THE WEEKEND, REPORTS OUT 
OF NORTH KOREA, THAT IT IS 
EITHER  CONTINUED ALONG WITH 
THAT NUCLEAR PROGRAM, MAKING 
EFFORTS TO ENHANCE IT AND IN 
ANY WAY SEEKING TO DECEIVE THIS 
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT ITS 
DENUCLEARIZATION INTENTIONS? 
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONFIRM 
OR DENY ANY INTELLIGENCE 
REPORTS. 
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE 
ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE 
PROGRESS. 
AMBASSADOR KIM HAD A MEETING 
JUST YESTERDAY WITH MEMBERS OF 
THE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION AND 
SECRETARY POMPEO AS I JUST 
MENTIONED. 
HE WILL BE GOING TO NORTH KOREA 
LATER THIS WEEK AND WE WILL 
CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. 
>> Reporter: CONTINUING TO MAKE 
PROGRESS. 
HOW CAN THE PUBLIC EVALUATE 
THEIR PROGRESS? 
>> WELL, A NUMBER OF THINGS. 
IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS, YOU 
HAVE NOT SEEN THIS A LAUNCHES. 
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN  NUCLEAR 
DETONATIONS, AND, AGAIN, THESE 
CONVERSATIONS ARE CONTINUING TO 
EVOLVE. 
I WILL NOT GET INTO THE DETAILS 
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
PROGRESS CONTINUES TO BE MADE. 
DAVE. 
>> Reporter: WHO ARE THE FOUR 
JUDICIAL CANDIDATES?  
>> WELL, IT WAS NOT ME SO I CAN 
CLEAR THAT UP. 
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE REALLY 
CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. 
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT IS BEING 
VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS 
PROCESS. 
HE IS LOOKING FOR CERTAIN 
CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH WE HAVE 
OUTLINED, AND BEYOND THAT, I 
CAN TELL YOU THAT HE MET WITH 
FOUR PEOPLE TODAY. 
THE MEETINGS LASTED ROUGHLY 45 
MINUTES. 
HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE -- YES. 
HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE 
MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF 
THE WEEK WITH A FEW OTHER 
CANDIDATES. 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU COMMENT ON 
THE CBS REPORT TODAY THAT THE 
JUDGES CAVANAUGH  AND BARRETT 
ARE THE TOP OF HIS LIST? 
>>, THEY SHOULD THIS I'M NOT 
GOING TO GET INTO ANY MORE OF 
THE PROCESS. 
MATTHEW. 
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT 
WROTE THAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS 
SHOULD  PASS THE IMMIGRATION 
BILL IN -- AND THEN ON SUNDAY, 
HE WROTE ON TWITTER, I NEVER 
PUSHED REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE 
TO BOTH FOR THE IMMIGRATION 
BILL. 
EITHER ONE OR TWO? 
WHY WOULD HE LIE ABOUT THAT? 
>> HE DID NOT. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ALL 
ALONG AND WE HAVE LAID OUT THE 
PRIORITIES AND PRINCIPLES THAT 
WE SUPPORT AND THAT WE WANTED 
TO SEE REFLECTED IN LEGISLATION 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE 
PRESIDENT WAS NOT AGGRESSIVELY 
LOBBYING MEMBERS BECAUSE HE 
KNEW THAT DEMOCRATS IN THE 
SENATE STILL WERE UNWILLING TO 
ACTUALLY COME TO THE TABLE AND 
FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN 
PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES. 
WE HEARD THIS I COULD HAVE 
GOTTEN IT THROUGH THE HOUSE BUT 
THAT DOES NOT WORK IF WE CANNOT 
GET INTO THE SENATE AND 
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IT 
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THEY DO 
NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO FIX 
PROBLEMS. 
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
LL THE WAY, I GUESS, FOR SOME 
REASON THEY THINK THIS IS A 
GOOD ISSUE FOR THEM. 
ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT. 
FRANKLY, I THINK THAT IS 
OUTRAGEOUS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE 
NOT COME TO THE TABLE AND TRY 
TO HELP FIX THIS PROBLEM. 
MARGARET. 
>> Reporter: THERE WAS A REPORT 
THAT IS EVEN KIND OF ON THE 
TABLE THAT -- 
>> KIND OF MAB. 
THAT SOUNDS SOLID. 
>> Reporter:  CHAIRMAN KIM 
INVITED TO NEW YORK AROUND AT 
THE YOU AND AND I WANTED TO GET 
IT ON THE RECORD IF YOU CAN PUT 
THAT IN CONTEXT FOR US, NUMBER 
ONE, IS THAT IN PLAY? 
NUMBER TWO, THE NUMBER OF 
CONDITIONS HAVE TO BE MET BUT 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU 
WOULD CONSIDER DOING? 
>> WE DO NOT HAVE ANY 
ANNOUNCEMENTS OR PLANS TO RULE 
OUT. 
>> Reporter:  WITHOUT GETTING 
INTO ALL OF THE FORM WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE TWO OF 
THE FIVE THAT HE IS LOOKING OUT 
FOR THE SUPREME COURT ARE WOMEN.
WERE ANY OF THE FOUR PEOPLE HE 
MET WITH TODAY WOMEN? 
NO I'M NOT GETTING INTO THOSE 
DETAILS. 
JOHN. 
>> Reporter: FOLLOWING UP ON 
THAT QUESTION, IS THIS AN 
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR THE 
PRESIDENT, GETTING A 
CONSERVATIVE WOMAN IN THE U.S. 
SUPREME COURT? 
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDET  WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY THAT MEETS 
THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT I HAVE 
LAID OUT, AND THAT IS WHAT HE 
IS FOCUSED ON. 
>> Reporter: IF I MAY ON TRADE, 
CANADA RESPONDED TO THE STEEL 
AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS IMPOSED ALREADY  
ON IMPORTED STEEL AND ALUMINUM. 
WHAT IS THE RESPONSE THROUGHOUT 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE 
PRESIDENT TO THAT ACTION? 
>> WE HAVE BEEN VERY NICE TO 
CANADA FOR MANY YEARS, AND THEY 
HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT, 
PARTICULARLY ADVANTAGE OF OUR 
FARMERS AND GOT THE G7, THE 
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY PROPOSED 
THAT THEY GET RID OF ALL 
TARIFFS AND DROP ALL BARRIERS 
AND HAVE REALLY GREAT TRADE AND 
THEY REFUSED THAT AND 
ESCALATING TARIFFS AGAINST THE 
UNITED STATES DOES NOTHING TO 
HELP CANADA. 
IT ONLY HURTS AMERICAN WORKERS. 
THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING TO FIX 
THE BROKEN SYSTEM, AND HE IS 
GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR 
THAT. 
JORDAN. 
>> Reporter: THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR APPEARED TO 
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN TO THE U.S. 
RECOGNIZING THE RUSSIAN 
ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA IN THE 
UPCOMING MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN.  
WILL YOU RULE OUT THE U.S. 
ACKNOWLEDGING THE ANNEXATION OR 
IS THAT ON THE TABLE? 
>> WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE RUSSIA'S 
ATTEMPT TO ANNEX CRIMEA. 
WE AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT 
FRONT AND THE CRIMEA SANCTIONS 
AGAINST RUSSIA WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE UNTIL RUSSIA RETURNS THE 
PENINSULA TO THE UKRAINE. 
STEVE. 
>> Reporter: A POSSIBILITY IN 
THE FUTURE?  
>> I SAID IT WOULD RECOGNIZING 
THE ANNEXATION BE ON THE TABLE 
IF RUSSIA AGREES TO CERTAIN 
CONCESSIONS? 
NO I'M NOT GETTING INTO 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
>> FOLLOWING UP ON NORTH KOREA, 
THE PRESIDENT HAD DECLARED ON 
TWITTER THAT THERE WAS NO 
LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT FROM 
NORTH KOREA AND EVEN PUTTING 
ASIDE HIS REPORTS ABOUT THE 
INTELLIGENCE MATERIAL, THERE IS 
ALSO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE 
IMAGERY, SHOWING ACTIVITY GOING 
ON AT THESE NORTH KOREAN SITES 
RELATED TO URANIUM PROCESSING 
AS WELL AS THE MISSILE 
FACILITIES. 
SO DOES THIS ADMINISTRATION 
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO LONGER 
A NUCLEAR THREAT? 
ALSO JOHN BOLTON YESTERDAY ON 
FACE THE NATION SO THAT THE 
OVERWHELMING BULK OF THE PROGRAM
COULD BE DISMANTLED WITHIN A 
YEAR WHILE EXPERTS ARE SAYING 
IT COULD TAKE 10 TO 15 YEARS SO 
COULD WE GET CLARITY? 
>> AGAIN, WE ARE CONTINUING TO 
MAKE PROGRESS. 
WE HAD GOOD MEETINGS YESTERDAY. 
AS I SAID, SECRETARY OF STATE 
WILL BE THERE LATER THIS WEEK 
AT TWO CONTINUE THOSE 
DISCUSSIONS. 
I AM NOT GOING TO CONFIRM OR 
DENY THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTING 
OUT THERE AND AS FAR AS THE ONE-
YEAR TIME, AMBASSADOR BOLTON 
SAID THAT IF NORTH KOREA MAKES 
THE DECISION TO DENUCLEARIZE 
THEIR BALLISTICS PROGRAMS COULD 
BE DISMANTLED IN A YEAR. 
THERE IS GREAT MOMENTUM RIGHT 
NOW FOR POSITIVE CHANGE, AND WE 
ARE MOVING TOGETHER FOR FURTHER 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
>> Reporter:  ON FRIDAY, THE -- 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT ONE OF 
THE TOPICS UP FOR DISCUSSION 
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN WOULD BE 
THE ELECTIONS THAT WE DO NOT 
WANT ELECTION MEDDLING. 
DOES THAT MEAN THAT HE INTENDS 
TO RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS? 
DOES HE HAVE ANY PROPOSALS OR 
ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT HE WOULD 
LIKE TO HEAR FROM VLADIMIR 
PUTIN ABOUT THAT? 
>> I WILL NOT GET AHEAD OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S CONVERSATIONS, BUT 
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED AND 
UPDATED AS THINGS DEVELOP. 
>> Reporter:  I WANTED TO ASK 
IF THE PRESIDENT IS OPEN TO THE 
NEW PRESIDENT-ELECT OF MEXICO? 
DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT 
HE WILL HAVE IMPACT ON AFTER 
NEGOTIATIONS OR CHANGE IN 
TERMS? 
>> THEY HAD A VERY POSITIVE AND 
CONSTRUCTIVE FIRST CALL THAT 
LASTED ABOUT HALF HOUR. 
THEY TALKED PRETTY EXTENSIVELY 
ABOUT TRADE. 
THE WILLINGNESS FOR BOTH 
PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER TO 
MAKE A DEAL AND WE ARE GOING TO 
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON MAKING 
SURE THAT WE GET A GOOD DEAL 
FOR THE UNITED STATES. 
>> Reporter: IS THE PRESIDENT  
THIS MEANT MICHAEL COHN IS 
GOING TO FLIP AND IS HE 
CONSIDERING? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS ON THIS TOPIC AND WE 
WILL REFER TO  THIS MIGHT REFER 
YOU TO THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
>> Reporter: AND PICKING  THEY 
-- PICKING UP ON TRADE,  THE EU 
RESPONDED WITH RETALIATORY 
TARIFFS AND CANDIDATE DID SO AS 
WELL AND MEXICO HAS DONE SO AS 
WELL AND TRY TO PUT THEIR 
TARIFFS ON AS WELL, SOME OF 
THEM EXPECTED TO COME $34 
BILLION WORTH IN THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. 
IS THE UNITED STATES WINNING 
THIS BATTLE? 
IF SO, HOW? 
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT IS 
FOCUSED NOT ON THE SHORT-TERM 
BUT ON THE LONG TERM, AND HE 
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 
DOING THINGS THAT HELP PROTECT 
AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN 
INDUSTRY. 
HE IS GOING TO KEEP PUSHING TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD 
TRADE DEALS. 
WE HAVE BEEN IN TRADE DEFICITS 
WITH NEARLY EVERY COUNTRY AND, 
ACROSS THE GLOBE, FOR YEARS AND 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO ENSURE 
THAT IT DOES NOT CONTINUE. 
>> Reporter:  FOR THE FOLKS 
THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS, AND 
THEY ARE HEARING, WE ARE IN IT 
FOR THE LONG TERM, IS THE LONG-
TERM WEEKS? 
MONTHS? 
YEARS? 
HOW LONG IS A LONG TERM? 
>> WE ARE NOT SETTING A 
TIMETABLE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON. 
WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON A 
NUMBER OF FRONTS ON THE 
PRESIDENT, AGAIN, IS COMMITTED 
TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE GOOD 
DEALS. 
HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET RID OF 
ALL TARIFFS AND ALL BARRIERS 
BUT IF THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT 
WANT TO DO THAT, HE WOULD BE 
HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND MAKE THAT 
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. 
TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD 
QUICKER. 
>> Reporter:  $34 BILLION ON 
FRIDAY? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE ANY CHANGES 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> Reporter:  TWO 
CLARIFICATIONS QUICKLY ON TWO 
DIFFERENT TOPICS. 
WITH THE PRESIDENT LIKE TO SEE 
ROE VERSUS WADE OVERTURNED? 
>> ONCE AGAIN, I'M NOT GETTING 
INTO ANY SPECIFICS. 
THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT. 
>> Reporter: I AM SAYING DOES 
HE HIMSELF AS A MATTER OF HOW 
HE FEELS, HIS OWN POLICY, WANT 
TO SEE IT OVERTURNED? 
>> AS THIS IS ONGOING I AM NOT 
GOING TO WEIGH IN ON ANYTHING 
SPECIFIC AT THIS POINT. 
>> Reporter: IT IS A POLICY 
QUESTION. 
I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT THE 
CONVERSATION. 
SO THAT I UNDERSTAND. 
I'M TELLING YOU THAT WHILE WE 
ARE IN THE MIDDLE I DO NOT HAVE 
AN  DATED COMMENT. 
>> Reporter: DOES THAT 
PRESIDENT STILL  TRUST KIM JONG-
UN? 
DOES HE BELIEVE HE IS 
NEGOTIATING? 
>> WE SEE MOMENTUM IN THE 
PROCESS AND WE HAVE HAD GOOD 
CONVERSATIONS AS RECENTLY AS 
YESTERDAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE 
THOSE CONVERSATIONS LATER THIS 
WEEK AND PUSH FORWARD. úWHEN TH 
THAT THAT WTO TRADE THEY --  IF 
THAT DOES NOT CHANGE, HE WILL 
DO SOMETHING. 
IS SEEN CONSIDERING ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN LEAVING THE WTO AND 
DOES HE HAVE A TIMETABLE? 
>> AS THE SECRETARY MANAGEMENT 
AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE SAID 
THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. 
THAT THE U.S. IS LEAVING THE 
WTO BUT HE HAS MADE CLEAR THAT 
HE HAS CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE 
A NUMBER OF ASPECTS THAT HE 
DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE FAIR AND 
TO CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
HAVE USED THE WTO TO THEIR OWN 
ADVANTAGE AND WE ARE FOCUSED ON 
FIXING THE SYSTEM. 
THAT WOULD INCLUDE THAT. 
>> Reporter:  TODAY, IF THE 
TREATMENT DOES NOT CHANGE THAT 
HE WILL DO SOMETHING BUT WHAT 
WAS HE REFERRING TO? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT ON WHAT HE DID. 
RIGHT NOW HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THE SYSTEM GET FIXED AND THAT 
IS WHAT HE IS FOCUSED ON. 
>> Reporter: DOES HE FEEL THAT  
JOHN McCAIN SHOULD RESIGN SO 
THAT HE CAN PICK A CENTER THAT 
WILL VOTE ON THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE? 
>> Reporter: THIS IS A PIVOTAL 
CHOICE FOR THE PRESIDENT, GOING 
TO AFFECT HIS LEGACY FOR 
DECADES TO COME.  
WHY IS THE WHITE HOUSE MOVING 
THE SO QUICKLY? 
WHEN HE ANNOUNCES ON MONDAY, 
THAT WILL BE JUST A LITTLE OVER 
TWO WEEKS, I THINK, SINCE 
KENNEDY ANNOUNCED HE IS 
RETIRING. 
>> THE PRESIDENT PUT OUT HIS 
LISTED NEARLY 2 YEARS AGO OF 
WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS WOULD LOOK 
LIKE AND HE HAS CONTINUED THEY 
-- HE MADE UPDATES TO THE LIST 
LAST YEAR, AND THESE ARE ALL 
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN 
LOOKED AT AND CONSIDERED, NOT 
JUST FOR THE LAST WEEK BUT FOR 
THE LAST TWO YEARS. 
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL IN, 
AND HE IS GOING TO MAKE THE 
RIGHT DECISION WHEN THE MOMENT 
COMES ON MONDAY.  
>> Reporter: JUST A FOLLOW-UP 
ON THE QUESTION THAT JEFF 
ASKED. 
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE PRESIDENT 
WANT TO SEE FROM THE WTO? 
WHAT ACTIONS DOES HE EXPECT 
THEM TO TAKE? 
>> THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE JUST AN OVERALL MORE FAIR 
TRADING SYSTEM.  
WE WILL BE CONTINUING 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIVIDUAL 
COUNTRIES AS WELL AS 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND WE WILL KEEP 
YOU POSTED ON ANY DETAILS. 
>> Reporter:  TWO QUESTIONS. 
ABOUT MICHAEL COHN, CAN YOU 
TELL US IF THE PRESIDENT WATCH 
THE INTERVIEW THIS MORNING AND 
POTENTIALLY  HOW HE FEELS ABOUT 
THE IDEA THAT THE FORMER 
ATTORNEY SAID THAT HE WOULD 
JUDGMENT HE WOULD PUT HIS WIFE 
AND THE SMART 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WEIGH IN ON 
THIS ISSUE AND I REFER YOU TO 
THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 
>> Reporter: THE OTHER 
QUESTION, YOU MADE IT VERY 
CLEAR THAT SANCTIONS FOR RUSSIA 
AS IT PERTAINS TO CRIMEA ARE 
NOT ON THE TABLE IN THE MEETING 
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
ELECTION MEDDLING 
ARE SANCTIONS FOR THE ELECTION 
MEDDLING ON THE TABLE  NEXT 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING. 
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED. 
>> Reporter:  TWO QUESTIONS, 
PLEASE. 
ONE FOREIGN AND ONE SEMESTER. 
>> Reporter: YOU ARE STARTING 
THE NEXT ENTRANCE.  
>> Reporter: A WEEK AGO, YOU 
TOLD US THAT THE PRESIDENT 
INTENDED TO CALL PRESIDENT 
HEARD ONE OF TURKEY  FOLLOWING 
HIS REELECTION OR HIS ELECTION 
AS PRESIDENT AND WE NEVER GOT A 
READOUT ON THAT CALL OR WHETHER 
OR NOT HE CONGRATULATED HIM. 
WOULD YOU ELUCIDATE ON THE CALL 
AND THA HE MADE IT TO THE 
PRESIDENT.  
>> YOU ALWAYS HAVE ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS IN THERE, JOHN. 
I KNOW THAT THEY SPOKE LAST 
WEEK. 
I WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE 
DETAILS. 
>> Reporter: A READOUT? 
>> I WILL GET BACK TO YOU. 
>> Reporter: THE OTHER QUESTION 
I HAD,  REGARDING THE 
PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON ROE 
VERSUS WADE, IN THE THIRD 
DEBATE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON, 
THE OPENING QUESTION WAS ABOUT 
THIS VERY SUBJECT AND HE DID 
SAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL 
OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE AND 
THE ISSUE OF ABORTION WOULD BE 
RETURNED TO THE STATES. 
IS THAT STILL HIS POSITION NOW? 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS PRO-LIFE, 
BUT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS OF 
SELECTING A SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE, AS THE PRESIDENT SAID 
LAST WEEK, HE IS NOT GOING TO 
DISCUSS SPECIFIC CASES WITH 
THOSE NOMINEES. 
>> Reporter: A QUESTION ON 
CHINA. 
YOU SAID THAT A LOT OF 
NEGOTIATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 
RIGHT NOW. 
IS THERE ANY REASON TO ASSUME 
OR TO SEE THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
PROGRESS WITH THE CHINESE  
BEFORE THE DEADLINE TO 
IMPLEMENT TARIFFS THIS WEEK? 
>> WE ARE CONTINUING THE 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER AT THIS 
POINT. 
>> Reporter:  NOW THAT GOODLAD 
ONE AND TWO ARE DEAD IN THE 
HOUSE, IS THE PRESIDENT OPEN TO 
ANY STAND-ALONE BILL WHICH 
WOULD STOP FAMILY SEPARATION AT 
THE BORDER? 
PERMANENTLY AND REFORM THE U.S. 
ASYLUM PROCESS? 
WHICH IS LED BY THE G.O.P. 
SENATORS AND SOME MEMBERS OF 
THE HOUSE? 
>> WE HAVE TO SEE THE SPECIFIC 
LEGISLATION BEFORE WE GO IN 
DIRECTLY BUT IT WOULD BE OPEN 
TO LEGISLATION THAT FIXES THE 
BROKEN SYSTEM IF DEMOCRATS 
WOULD SHOW UP TO DO THEIR JOBS 
AND PARTICIPATE IN SOLUTIONS. 
WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS 
THOSE AND, AGAIN, SUPPORTIVE 
THINGS THAT HELP TO FIX THE 
BROKEN SYSTEM. 
>> Reporter:  WHAT IS CURRENT 
U.S. POLICY AT THE BORDER? 
IS IT ZERO-TOLERANCE OR CATCH 
AND RELEASE? 
>> THE EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS 
BOUGHT TIME FOR CONGRESS BUT 
THAT THEY -- THE CLOCK IS 
TICKING AND CONGRESS NEEDS TO 
ACT TO FIX THIS PROCESS BECAUSE 
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME ON 
WHAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO, 
PARTICULARLY WITH THE DISTRICT 
COURT  THAT CHIMED IN LAST 
WEEK. 
>> Reporter:  GOING BACK TO 
TRADE FOR A SECOND, THE U.S. 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHICH 
GENERALLY WORKS VERY WELL WITH 
REPUBLICAN -- THEY WANT THEM TO 
OPPOSE THE TARIFF AGENDA AND 
SAYS THAT THE MINISTRATION IS 
THREATENING TO UNDERMINE THE 
ECONOMIC PROGRESS THEY HAVE 
WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE. 
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT MAKE OF 
THAT CRITICISM? 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON 
HELPING PROTECT AMERICAN 
WORKERS AND INDUSTRIES AND 
CREATE A FAIR PLAYING FIELD. 
THAT IS WHAT HE IS HOPING TO 
ACHIEVE AND WE ARE CONFIDENT. 
>> Reporter: FORMER PRIME 
MINISTER OF CANADA --  WHEN HE 
WAS HERE FOR? 
>> Reporter: IF I COULD ASK EGG 
-- MAKE A QUICK COMMENT. 
YOU ARE MOST WELCOME AT ANY 
INDIAN RESTAURANT IN THIS AREA. 
>>> THANK YOU. 
>> Reporter: MY QUESTION IS TWO 
PARTS. 
ONE,  WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS 
GOING TO MAKE HISTORY BY 
VISITING INDIA BECAUSE AT 1.2 
BILLION INDIANS ARE WAITING FOR 
HIM. 
>> I WILL KEEP YOU POSTED BUT I 
DO NOT THINK WE HAVE A TRIP 
PLANNED BUT WE WILL TAKE ONE 
LAST QUESTION. 
>> Reporter:  LEGAL IMMIGRATION 
CONCERN -- PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE 
LEGALLY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE 
LIVING HERE LEGALLY. 
THEY ARE WAITING TO GET GREEN 
CARDS. 
THIS CONTINUES. 500,000 GREEN 
CARDS. 
IT WILL TAKE ABOUT B,70 FOR THE 
TO GRADUATE FROM ANY PARTICLE 
THEY -- CLEARING THESE BACKLOGS 
FOR THE LEGAL IMMIGRANTS  THAT 
ARE GOING ACROSS THE U.S. AND 
DEMONSTRATING AND ASKING IF 
THIS WILL HELP? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED 
MANY TIMES ABOUT FIXING THE 
OVERALL SYSTEM, BOTH ILLEGAL 
AND LEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
WE WANTED TO CERTAINLY ADDRESS 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
SECURING OUR BORDERS AND 
PROTECTING AMERICAN COMMUNITIES.
HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, 
THERE IS A PROCESS THAT PEOPLE 
SHOULD FOLLOW AND WE WANT TO 
LOOK FOR WAYS TO FIX THAT 
PROCESS AS WELL AND EXPEDITE 
THAT I WILL COME FOR THE LAST 
QUESTION. 
>> Reporter: CONTINUING ON 
IMMIGRATION, VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE WAS IN CENTRAL AMERICA,  
TELLING LEADERS THAT THEY NEED 
TO DO MORE TO CONTROL 
IMMIGRATION. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THREATENED 
TO CUT FORWARD A TWO CENTRAL 
AMERICAN NATIONS IF THEY DO NOT 
DO MORE TO ADDRESS THE OUTFLOW 
OF IMMIGRANTS. 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT SPECIFIC 
STEPS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TAKEN 
TO CARRY OUT THIS THREAT? 
HAVE THERE BEEN MEETINGS WITH 
USAID? 
STATE DEPARTMENT? 
TO OUTLINE WHAT COULD BE CUT? 
>> FRANKLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THAT NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM STEP UP 
AND DO MORE TO STOP ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION INTO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THEIR HELP AND THEIR 
PARTICIPATION IN MAKING THAT 
HAPPEN. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAVE A 
GREAT DAY. 
>> Reporter: WHAT IS THE 
ADMINISTRATION DOING TO ENSURE 
THAT 2000 PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT 
BACK TO THEIR PARENTS, SARAH?  
>>> THERE YOU HAVE IT. 
YOU HEARD SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS GOING THROUGH ISSUES AS 
IS USUALLY THE CASE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING. 
SHE TOUCHED ON QUITE A FEW 
QUESTIONS ABOUT NORTH KOREA,  
WHETHER THEY ARE TRYING TO PULL 
THE WOOL OVER THE U.S. EYES ON 
THESE --  DENUCLEARIZATION, ETC.
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT CANDIDATES, AND THE 
PRESIDENT HAS MET WITH FOUR 
CANDIDATES FOR EXTENDED 
MEETINGS AND HE WILL MEET WITH 
SOME OTHERS, COMING UP. 
THE SUMMIT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, 
THE CONVERSATION WITH THE 
MEXICO NEW PRESIDENT-ELECT 
AVENUE -- AND THE WORLD TRADE 
ORGANIZATION.
