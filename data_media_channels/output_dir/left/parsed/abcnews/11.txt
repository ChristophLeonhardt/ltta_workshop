>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 
APPEAR IN THE ROSE GARDEN.

JUNCKER.

REPRESENTATIVE DAN KNEWHOUSE.
REPRESENTATIVE CHRISTIE -- HAVE

THAT WAS A GREAT WIN.
THANK YOU, CHRISTIE.
REPRESENTATIVE DAVID REICHERT.
DAVID, THANK YOU.
SO WE HAD A BIG DAY.
VERY BIG.
WE MET RIGHT HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO LAUNCH A NEW PHASE IN 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, A PHASE OF CLOSE 
FRIENDSHIP, OF STRONG TRADE 
RELATIONS IN WHICH BOTH OF US 
WILL WIN.
I'M WORKING BETTER TOGETHER FOR 
GLOBAL SECURITY AND PROSPERITY, 
AND OF FIGHTING JOINTLY AGAINST 
TERRORISM.
THE UNITED STATES AND THE 
EUROPEAN UNION TOGETHER ACCOUNT 
FOR MORE THAN 830 MILLION 
CITIZENS AND MORE THAN 50% OF 
THE GLOBAL GDP.
IN OTHER WORDS, TOGETHER WE'RE 
MORE THAN 50% OF TRADE.
IF WE TEAM UP, WE CAN MAKE OUR 
PLANET A BETTER, MORE SECURE, 
AND MORE PROSPEROUS PLACE.
ALREADY TODAY THE UNITED STATES 
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE A 
$1 TRILLION BILATERAL TRADE 
RELATIONSHIP.
THE LARGEST ECONOMIC 
RELATIONSHIP ANYWHERE IN THE 
WORLD.
WE WANT TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN 
THIS TRADE RELATIONSHIP TO THE 
BENEFIT OF ALL-AMERICAN AND 
EUROPEAN CITIZENS.
THIS IS WHY WE AGREED TODAY, 
FIRST OF ALL, TO WORK TOGETHER 
TOWARDS ZERO TARIFFS, ZERO 
NON-TARIFF BARRIERS, AND ZERO 
SUBSIDIES ON NON-AUTO INDUSTRIAL
GOODS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
WE WILL ALSO WORK TO REDUCE 
BARRIERS AND INCREASE TRADE IN 
SERVICES, CHEMICALS, 
PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL 
PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS SOYBEANS.
SOYBEANS IS A BIG DEAL.
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION IS GOING 
TO START ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO 
BUY A LOT OF SOYBEANS.
THEY ARE A TREMENDOUS MARKET.
BUY A LOT OF SOYBEANS FROM OUR 
FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST PR
PRIMARILY.
SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT, 
JEAN-CLAUDE.
THIS WILL OPEN MARKETS FOR 
FARMERS AND WORKERS, INCREASE 
INVESTMENT, AND LEAD TO GREATER 
PROSPERITY IN BOTH THE UNITED 
STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION.
IT WILL ALSO MAKE TRADE FAIRER 
AND MORE RECIPROCAL.
MY FAVORITE WORD, RECIPROCAL.
SECONDLY, WE AGREED TO A 
STRENGTHENED AND STRENGTHENING 
OF OUR STRATEGIC COOPERATION 
WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY.
THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO 
IMPORT MORE LIQUEFIED NATURAL 
GAS, LNG, FROM THE UNITED 
STATES, AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE
A VERY, VERY BIG BUYER.
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH 
EASIER FOR THEM, BUT THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE A MASSIVE BUYER OF 
LNG.
SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO 
DIVERSIFY THEIR ENERGY SUPPLY, 
WHICH THEY WANT VERY MUCH TO DO,
AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF IT.
THIRDLY, WE AGREED TODAY TO 
LAUNCH A CLOSE DIALOGUE ON 
STANDARDS IN ORDER TO EASE 
TRADE, REDUCE BUREAUCRATIC 
OBSTACLES, AND SLASH COSTS 
DRAMATICALLY.
FOURTHLY, WE AGREED TO JOINT 
FORCES TO PROTECT AMERICAN AND 
EUROPEAN COMPANIES FROM BETTER 
AND REALLY BETTER THAN EVER -- 
WE'VE NEVER DONE LIKE WE'RE 
DOING, I CAN SAY FROM THE 
STANDPOINT OF THE UNITED STATES.
WE HAVE NEVER DONE THIS WELL, 
BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO A LOT 
BETTER AFTER WE DO THIS DEAL AND
OTHER DEALS THAT WE ARE 
CURRENTLY WORKING ON.
LIKEWISE, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS 
GOING TO DO BETTER, STRONGER, 
BIGGER.
WE WILL, THEREFORE, WORK CLOSELY
TOGETHER WITH LIKE-MINDED 
PARTNERS TO REFORM THE WTO AND 
TO ADDRESS UNFAIR TRADING 
PRACTICES, INCLUDING 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT, 
FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, 
INDUSTRIAL SUBSIDIES, 
DISTORTIONS CREATED BY 
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, AND 
OVERCAPACITY.
WE DECIDED TO SET UP IMMEDIATELY
AN EXECUTIVE WORKING GROUP, OF 
VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ON BOTH 
SIDES.
THEY WILL BE OUR CLOSEST 
ADVISORS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO 
CARRY OUT THIS JOINT AGENDA.
IN ADDITION, IT WILL IDENTIFY 
SHORT-TERM MEASURES TO 
FACILITATE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGES 
AND ASSESS EXISTING TARIFF 
MEASURES AND WHAT WE CAN DO 
ABOUT THAT TO THE BETTERMENT OF 
BOTH.
WHILE WE ARE WORKING ON THIS, WE
WILL NOT GO AGAINST THE SPIRIT 
OF THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS EITHER 
PARTY TERMINATES THE 
NEGOTIATION.
SO WE'RE STARTING THE 
NEGOTIATION RIGHT NOW, BUT WE 
KNOW VERY MUCH WHERE IT'S GOING.
WE ALSO WILL VRESOLVE THE STEEL 
AND ALUMINUM TARIFF ISSUES, AND 
WE WILL RESOLVE RETALIATORY 
TARIFFS.
WE HAVE SOME TARIFFS THAT ARE 
RETALIATORY, AND THAT WILL GET 
RESOLVED AS PART OF WHAT WE'RE 
DOING.
AND WITH THAT, JEAN-CLAUDE, 
PLEASE. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN, WHEN I WAS INVITED BY
THE PRESIDENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE
I HAD ONE INTENTION.
I HAD THE INTENSE TO MAKE A DEAL
TODAY, AND WE MADE A DEAL TODAY.
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF 
AREAS IN WHICH TO WORK TOGETHER.
WORK TOWARDS ZERO TARIFFS ON 
INDUSTRIAL GOODS.
THAT WAS MY MAIN INTENTION.
TO PROPOSE TO COME DOWN TO ZERO 
TARIFFS ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS.
WE'VE DECIDED TO STRENGTHEN OUR 
COOPERATION ON ENERGY.
YOU WILL BUILD MORE TERMINALS TO
IMPORT LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS 
FROM THE U.S.
THIS IS ALSO A MESSAGE FOR 
OTHERS.
WE AGREE TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE
ON STANDARDS.
AS FAR AS AGRICULTURE IS 
CONCERNED, THE EUROPEAN UNION 
CAN IMPORT MORE SOYBEANS FROM 
THE U.S., AND IT WILL BE DONE.
AND WE ALSO AGREE TO WORK 
TOGETHER ON THE REFORM OF THE 
WTO.
THIS, OF COURSE, IS ON THE 
UNDERSTANDING THAT AS LONG AS WE
ARE NEGOTIATING, UNLESS ONE 
PARTY WOULD STOP THE 
NEGOTIATIONS, WE HOLD OFF 
FURTHER TARIFFS AND REASSESS 
EXISTING TARIFFS ON STEEL AND 
ALUMINUM.
THIS WAS A GOOD CONSTRUCTIVE 
MEETING.
THANK YOU, DONALD. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
JEAN-CLAUDE.
>> AND I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE 
BY SAYING THIS WAS A VERY BIG 
DAY FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE.
VERY BIG DAY, INDEED.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION, JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER,
ANNOUNCING THEY REACHED SOME 
AGREEMENT TOG FORWARD ON TRADE.
TERRY, LISTENING TO BOTH LEADERS
RIGHT THERE, WHAT IS SOUNDS LIKE
IS ACTUALLY A DE-ESCALATION 
AGREEMENT.
NOT A LOT OF CONCRETE MEASURES 
ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT, 
ALTHOUGH THE EUROPEANS SAID THEY
WILL BE BUYING MORE SOYBEANS.
BUT THEY ARE BASICALLY GOING TO 
HOLD OFF ON NEW TARIFFS AND 
ESCALATION IN THE TRADE WAR AS 
THEY TALK ABOUT FIGURING OUT 
SOME WAY TO GET TO ZERO TARIFFS 
AND A NEW TRADING RELATIONSHIP. 
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS, AS YOU SAY, IT'S AN 
ASPIRATIONAL DEAL.
THEY AGREED TO BEGIN 
NEGOTIATIONS AND WORK TOGETHER 
TOWARDS A REGIME OF NO TARIFFS 
ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.
THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERED THIS, 
REMEMBER.
WHAT MADE PRESIDENT TRUMP ANGRY 
WAS THAT THIS STEEL AND ALUMINUM
PROTECTIONIST MEASURES IN EUROPE
HE BELIEVED WERE HURTING THE 
INDUSTRIAL CORE OF THE UNITED 
STATES WHICH SUPPORTED HIM AND 
WHICH HE WANTED TO DELIVER 
SOMETHING TO, AND THAT AT LEAST 
IS WHAT HAS BEGUN HERE.
I TELL YOU, THERE IS NO QUESTION
THAT WALL STREET IS RELIEVED 
BECAUSE THE PROSPECT OF YET 
ANOTHER TRADE WAR, REMEMBER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ONE ONGOING 
RIGHT NOW WITH CHINA, ONE WITH 
CANADA AND MEXICO SEEMS TO BE IN
THE OFFING, AND THERE WAS ONE 
CERTAINLY COOKING BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.
THE RELIEF OF THAT PRESSURE SENT
THE STOCK MARKET SKYROCKETING 
TODAY.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T 
SEEN WERE PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE IS WILLING TO BACK DOWN A 
LITTLE BIT ON HIS PUNITIVE 
PROTECTIONIST AGENDA AND AGREE 
TO TALK. 
>> IT WENT UP 150 POINTS AFTER 
WORD OF A POTENTIAL AGREEMENT 
LEAKED.
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A COUPLE WEEKS
MAKES, TARA.
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN EUROPE A 
COUPLE WEEKS AGO CALLING EUROPE 
A FOE. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND JAUND CLAUD JUNCKER CAME TO 
TOWN READY TO MAKE A DEAL.
U.S. OFFICIALS SEEMED RELUCTANT 
THAT HIS PLAN WHICH WAS TO OFFER
A SMALL TRADE DEAL ON INDUSTRIAL
PR
PRODUCTS OR GET RID OF TARIFFS 
ON CARS WOULD ACTUALLY BE 
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WOULD TAKE TO AND BE INTERESTED 
IN.
HE HAS BEEN ANIMATED SAYING HE 
DOESN'T WANT TARIFFS OR 
SUBSIDIES.
HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE SOME SORT OF
DEAL TO DE-ESCALATE AND -- WHAT 
THEY REALLY WANTED WAS FOR HIM 
TO COME HOME SAYING THERE WILL 
BE NO TARIFFS OBJECT CARS.
THE GERMAN CAR MAKERS WERE 
REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT AND 
THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T FOLLOW 
THROUGH AND PLACE A 25% TARIFF 
ON THAT.
BUT, YEAH, IT'S A REAL CHANGE 
FROM LAST WEEK, AND WE'LL SEE 
WHERE THIS ACTUALLY LEADS TO.
AS WE KNOW, THE U.S. AND THE 
EUROPEAN UNION BEFORE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TOOK OFFICE WAS WORKING ON
A REALLY BROAD TRANS-ATLANTIC 
TRADE AGREEMENT, AND THAT FELL 
APART.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
PRESIDENT TRUMP PULLED OUT OF
