GOING TO HAVE ONE OR TWO JURORS WHO MAYBE WILL HANG UP THE JURY

68
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,998
WHO MAYBE WILL HANG UP THE JURY BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS AN

00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:48,733
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS AN UNFAIR PROSECUTION.

70
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,435
UNFAIR PROSECUTION. I THINK, BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE

71
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,404

THAT’S FAST. BOB, LET ME GET YOU TO WEIGH IN.

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,718
>> I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A QUICK CASE, KRISTEN, BUT I DON’T

85
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,254
QUICK CASE, KRISTEN, BUT I DON’T THINK WHAT THE DEFENSE DID HERE

86
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:10,654
THINK WHAT THE DEFENSE DID HERE WAS UNUSUAL.

87
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,256
WAS UNUSUAL. HERE IS THE REASON WHY, THE

88
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,290
HERE IS THE REASON WHY, THE GOVERNMENT CHOSE TO PUT RICK

89
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,859
GOVERNMENT CHOSE TO PUT RICK GATES ON, AND THAT WAS A RISKY

90
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:15,159
GATES ON, AND THAT WAS A RISKY MOVE.

91
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,862
MOVE. AS A PROSECUTOR MYSELF, WORKING

92
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,263
AS A PROSECUTOR MYSELF, WORKING WITH COOPERATING WITNESSES, WHEN

93
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,433
WITH COOPERATING WITNESSES, WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON, I USE THE

94
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,335
YOU PUT THEM ON, I USE THE ANALOGY, WHEN YOU SLEEP WITH A

95
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:27,438
ANALOGY, WHEN YOU SLEEP WITH A DOG, YOU CATCH FLEEAS, OR THEY’L

96
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,974
DOG, YOU CATCH FLEEAS, OR THEY’L ARGUE BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK

97
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:30,341
ARGUE BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER.

98
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:31,442
TOGETHER. THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A DEFENSE

99
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:33,077
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A DEFENSE TO PUT ON A DEFENDANT WHO WOULD

100
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,079
TO PUT ON A DEFENDANT WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN HAMMERED ON

101
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:35,780
HAVE BEEN HAMMERED ON CROSS-EXAMINATION BECAUSE OF THE

102
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,048
CROSS-EXAMINATION BECAUSE OF THE E-MAIL AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

103
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,183
E-MAIL AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND TAX RETURNS, WHEN THEY HAD

104
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,284
AND TAX RETURNS, WHEN THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AT THEIR OWN

105
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:41,886
AN OPPORTUNITY AT THEIR OWN WITNESS, IF YOU WILL, BY

106
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,553
WITNESS, IF YOU WILL, BY CROSS-EXAMINING GATES.

107
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,088
CROSS-EXAMINING GATES. THEY’RE GOING TO MAKE THE WHOLE

108
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:44,855
THEY’RE GOING TO MAKE THE WHOLE CASE ABOUT GATES.

109
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:45,990
CASE ABOUT GATES. THEY’RE GOING TO SAY, AND HERE’S

110
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,092
THEY’RE GOING TO SAY, AND HERE’S HOW I DO IT IN SUMMATION, LADIES

00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:52,230
AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, THEY CALLED DPAETS SEDED GATES FOR A

113
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:53,865
CALLED DPAETS SEDED GATES FOR A THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE WASN’T

114
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,199
THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE WASN’T ENOUGH.

115
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,500
ENOUGH. YOU’RE GOING TO PUT MY CLIENT --

116
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,002
YOU’RE GOING TO PUT MY CLIENT -- THEY WON’T SAY IN JAIL -- BUT

117
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:01,038
THEY WON’T SAY IN JAIL -- BUT YOU’RE GOING TO CONVICT MY

118
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,608
YOU’RE GOING TO CONVICT MY CLIENT BASED ON A PERSON HAVING

119
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,010
CLIENT BASED ON A PERSON HAVING AFFAIRS, A PERSON WHO STOLE

120
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:05,310
AFFAIRS, A PERSON WHO STOLE MONEY?

121
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,145
MONEY? THEY DIDN’T PUT HIM ON FOR NO

122
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:07,512
THEY DIDN’T PUT HIM ON FOR NO REASON.

123
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:08,713
REASON. THAT WAS THE PERSON THEY NEEDED.

124
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:09,581
THAT WAS THE PERSON THEY NEEDED. YOU SHOULD NOT BELIEVE HIM

125
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,782
YOU SHOULD NOT BELIEVE HIM BECAUSE HE IS NOT WORTHY OF

126
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:11,116
BECAUSE HE IS NOT WORTHY OF BELIEF.

127
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,518
BELIEF. I THOUGHT IT WAS A RISKY MOVE

128
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,119
I THOUGHT IT WAS A RISKY MOVE FOR THEM TO PUT HIM ON.

129
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,820
FOR THEM TO PUT HIM ON. >> YOU SEE, IN RESPONSE TO THAT,

130
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,021
>> YOU SEE, IN RESPONSE TO THAT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS A REBUTTAL.

131
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,490
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A REBUTTAL. THEY HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROOF.

132
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,924
THEY HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROOF. IN THE REBUTTAL, THAT I WILL

DEFENSE COUNSEL, TO DO IT AT THE CLOSE OF THE EVIDENCE.

166
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,681
CLOSE OF THE EVIDENCE. IT IS A ROUTINE PROCEDURE.

167
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,082
IT IS A ROUTINE PROCEDURE. GENERALLY, JUDGES DENY IT.

168
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,082
GENERALLY, JUDGES DENY IT. THEIR ONLY ARGUMENT AT THIS

169
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,651
THEIR ONLY ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT, REALLY, IS TO ATTACK

170
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,186
POINT, REALLY, IS TO ATTACK GATES, ATTACK HIS CREDIBILITY,

171
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,055
GATES, ATTACK HIS CREDIBILITY, TO SAY HE IS A LIAR, AND TO SAY

172
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:24,490
TO SAY HE IS A LIAR, AND TO SAY THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT MET THEIR

173
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:24,824
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT MET THEIR BURDEN.

174
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,592
BURDEN. >> WE ALSO HEARD FROM PAUL

175
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:28,794
>> WE ALSO HEARD FROM PAUL MANAFORT YESTERDAY, ALBEIT VERY

176
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:29,094
MANAFORT YESTERDAY, ALBEIT VERY BRIEFLY.

177
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:33,165
BRIEFLY. LET’S PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

178
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:33,699
LET’S PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CLIP.

179
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,301
CLIP. WE DON’T HAVE ANY MORE SOUND,

180
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:40,606
WE DON’T HAVE ANY MORE SOUND, BUT HE DID SAY, I HAVE DECIDED,

181
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:41,540
BUT HE DID SAY, I HAVE DECIDED, YOURSELF

182
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:42,575
YOURSELF YOUR HONOR, DO YOU WISH TO

183
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:43,576
YOUR HONOR, DO YOU WISH TO TESTIFY, NO, SIR.

184
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:44,610
TESTIFY, NO, SIR. EVERYONE THOUGHT HE ULTIMATELY

185
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,578
EVERYONE THOUGHT HE ULTIMATELY WASN’T GOING TO TESTIFY.

186
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:49,615
WASN’T GOING TO TESTIFY. HOW DO YOU MAKE WHAT WE SAW FROM

187
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,083
HOW DO YOU MAKE WHAT WE SAW FROM PAUL MANAFORT DURING THIS CASE?

188
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,418
PAUL MANAFORT DURING THIS CASE? DIDN’T HEAR A WHOLE LOT FROM

189
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:52,685
DIDN’T HEAR A WHOLE LOT FROM HIM.

190
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:53,219
HIM. NO SURPRISE THERE.

191
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:54,620
NO SURPRISE THERE. >> SOMETHING, KRISTEN, I FOUND

192
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,288
>> SOMETHING, KRISTEN, I FOUND WAS INTERESTING, IS AT ONE POINT

193
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:58,891
WAS INTERESTING, IS AT ONE POINT IN TIME, HIS ATTORNEY

194
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,592
IN TIME, HIS ATTORNEY MISCHARACTERIZED AN EVIDENCE

195
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:01,694
MISCHARACTERIZED AN EVIDENCE NUMBER OF A PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN

196
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:02,728
NUMBER OF A PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PAGES

197
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:03,529
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS.

198
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,598
OF DOCUMENTS. IN FRONT OF THE JURY, HE

199
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:06,932
IN FRONT OF THE JURY, HE CORRECTED HIS OWN LAWYER TO GIVE

200
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,134
CORRECTED HIS OWN LAWYER TO GIVE HIM THE RIGHT EXHIBIT NUMBER.

201
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:09,769
HIM THE RIGHT EXHIBIT NUMBER. NOW, IF YOU’RE A GOOD TRIAL

202
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:10,803
NOW, IF YOU’RE A GOOD TRIAL LAWYER, YOU’VE BEEN AROUND THE

203
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,538
LAWYER, YOU’VE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK LIKE I HAVE, YOU KNOW THE

204
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:14,306
BLOCK LIKE I HAVE, YOU KNOW THE JURY IS WATCHING EVERY SINGLE

205
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:15,608
JURY IS WATCHING EVERY SINGLE THING THAT IS GOING ON.

206
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,043
THING THAT IS GOING ON. I THINK THAT THAT WOULD SPELL TO

207
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,911
I THINK THAT THAT WOULD SPELL TO THEM, IN A VERY SUBTLE WAY, THAT

208
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:20,746
THEM, IN A VERY SUBTLE WAY, THAT THIS IS NOT A GUY WHO JUST LETS

209
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,114
THIS IS NOT A GUY WHO JUST LETS GATES DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

210
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,716
GATES DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. HE IS A DETAIL GUY.

211
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,518
HE IS A DETAIL GUY. HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING.

212
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:26,953
HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING. THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF

213
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,354
THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF TIMES WHERE HE IS SITTING SMUGLY

214
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:29,055
TIMES WHERE HE IS SITTING SMUGLY AT THE COUNSEL TABLE.

215
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:30,790
AT THE COUNSEL TABLE. I DON’T THINK HE MADE A GREAT

216
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,657
I DON’T THINK HE MADE A GREAT APPEARANCE THAT WAY.

217
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,325
APPEARANCE THAT WAY. EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A RIGHT NOT

218
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,460
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A RIGHT NOT TO TESTIFY, NEVERTHELESS, THAT

219
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,562
TO TESTIFY, NEVERTHELESS, THAT JURY IS LOOKING AT HIM.

220
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,064
JURY IS LOOKING AT HIM. OBVIOUSLY, HE CHOSE NOT TO

221
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:39,332
OBVIOUSLY, HE CHOSE NOT TO TESTIFY BECAUSE THEY HAD GATES,

222
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,667
TESTIFY BECAUSE THEY HAD GATES, AND THAT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF

223
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,935
AND THAT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF THE CASE.

224
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:43,136
THE CASE. MOREOVER, IF HE GOT ON THE

225
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,572
MOREOVER, IF HE GOT ON THE STAND, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER,

226
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:46,272
STAND, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, HE’S GOT ANOTHER INDICTMENT HE’S

227
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:47,240
HE’S GOT ANOTHER INDICTMENT HE’S FACING, AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN

228
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:48,341
FACING, AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECTING HIMSELF TO

229
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,642
SUBJECTING HIMSELF TO CROSS-EXAMINATION AND COULD HAVE

230
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:50,843
CROSS-EXAMINATION AND COULD HAVE GOTTEN HIMSELF INTO DEEPER,

231
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:52,278
GOTTEN HIMSELF INTO DEEPER, HOTTER WATER.

232
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,479
HOTTER WATER. HE’S REALLY BETWEEN A ROCK AND A

233
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:54,080
HE’S REALLY BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.

234
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:56,583
HARD PLACE. I AGREE WITH THE GUEST, THAT IT

235
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:58,585
I AGREE WITH THE GUEST, THAT IT WOULD BE, IN MY REASON, A QUICK

236
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,921
WOULD BE, IN MY REASON, A QUICK RETURN OF A GUILTY VERDICT ON

237
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:01,554
RETURN OF A GUILTY VERDICT ON MOST COUNTS.

238
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:02,588
MOST COUNTS. >> I’LL TELL YOU WHO IS WATCHING

239
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,690
>> I’LL TELL YOU WHO IS WATCHING THIS CLOSELY, THE PRESIDENT AND

240
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,391
THIS CLOSELY, THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE.

241
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:04,958
THE WHITE HOUSE. GUESS WHAT?

242
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,559
GUESS WHAT? HE’S UP AND TWEETING TODAY.

243
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,461
HE’S UP AND TWEETING TODAY. LET ME READ THAT FOR YOU BOTH.

244
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:09,896
LET ME READ THAT FOR YOU BOTH. THE RIGGED RUSSIAN WITCH MUSTN’T

245
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:11,998
THE RIGGED RUSSIAN WITCH MUSTN’T GOES ON AND ON AS THE

246
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,333
GOES ON AND ON AS THE ORIGINATORS AND FOUNDERS OF THE

247
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,667
ORIGINATORS AND FOUNDERS OF THE SCAM CONTINUE TO BE FIRED AND

248
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:15,902
SCAM CONTINUE TO BE FIRED AND DEMOTED FOR THEIR CORRUPT AND

249
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:16,803
DEMOTED FOR THEIR CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

250
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:18,471
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. ALL CREDIBILITY IS GONE FROM

251
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:19,572
ALL CREDIBILITY IS GONE FROM THIS TERRIBLE HOAX.

252
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,009
THIS TERRIBLE HOAX. MUCH MORE WILL BE LOST AS IT

253
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:23,376
MUCH MORE WILL BE LOST AS IT PROCEEDS.

254
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,810
PROCEEDS. NO COLLUSION.

255
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:27,514
NO COLLUSION. HE REFERENCES PETER STRZOK WHO

256
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:28,915
HE REFERENCES PETER STRZOK WHO WAS FIRED YESTERDAY FROM THE

257
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,683
WAS FIRED YESTERDAY FROM THE FBI, CALLING IT A DECISIVE STEP

258
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:31,918
FBI, CALLING IT A DECISIVE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

259
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,319
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. JEFF, LET ME GIVE THE FINAL

260
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,989
JEFF, LET ME GIVE THE FINAL COMMENT TO YOU.

261
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,224
COMMENT TO YOU. OBVIOUSLY, THE JURY NOT PAYING

262
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,225
OBVIOUSLY, THE JURY NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE TWEETS, OR AT

263
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:39,826
ATTENTION TO THE TWEETS, OR AT LEAST NOT SUPPOSED TO.

264
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:40,360
LEAST NOT SUPPOSED TO. >> LET’S HOPE SO.

265
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:41,628
>> LET’S HOPE SO. >> WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT THE

266
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:42,829
>> WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT THE PRESIDENT IS TWEETING, CALLING

267
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,831
PRESIDENT IS TWEETING, CALLING THIS ALL A RIGGED WITCH HUNT,

268
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,966
THIS ALL A RIGGED WITCH HUNT, WHILE THIS SERIOUS CASE IS

269
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,434
WHILE THIS SERIOUS CASE IS MOVING FORWARD?

270
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:48,001
MOVING FORWARD? >> INTERESTING POINT.

271
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:49,736
>> INTERESTING POINT. IF, IN FACT, THE JURY IS PAYING

272
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:50,737
IF, IN FACT, THE JURY IS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT

273
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,073
ATTENTION TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TWEETING, THEN YOU HAVE A

274
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:55,242
IS TWEETING, THEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS

275
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,077
SITUATION WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS ULTIMATELY INFLUENCING WHAT THE

276
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,346
ULTIMATELY INFLUENCING WHAT THE JURY VERDICT WOULD BE.

277
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,747
JURY VERDICT WOULD BE. IF I’M MUELLER, I WOULD LOOK AT

278
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:03,183
IF I’M MUELLER, I WOULD LOOK AT THAT AND SAY, IS THIS ANOTHER

279
00:07:03,227 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT AND SAY, IS THIS ANOTHER ACT TOWARD OBSTRUCTION?
