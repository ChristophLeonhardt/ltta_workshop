1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Cedar Bayou now almost 52 inches of rain
and Chris I think cedar Bayou would be

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,230
52 but the rain gauge failed while it
was still raining so 50 1.88 that will

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,549
probably be the record because the rain
now has stopped thank goodness it has

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,710
already stopped finally stop the rain is
still though raining in orange Orange

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,980
Texas Beaumont Port Arthur seeing an
awful lot of rain Orange you picked up

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,789
almost 12 inches of rain overnight and
that's just in the past six hours the

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,210
rain is going to continue you had to you
talked about this Gris two areas one to

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,899
the east and one right over where the
eye is or the center of the tropical

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,770
storm that is where the rain will be
again the heaviest for today now let's

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,719
get to this story about the attics and
the Barker reservoir when they take you

11
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,520
to Google Earth's Houston proper right
through here and we talked about this

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,800
Buffalo Bayou it goes right from Houston
right into these two reservoirs the

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,800
reservoirs were built because in back in
1940 those 250,000 people living in

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,290
Houston and they said let's hold the
water back cuz this is farmland

15
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,689
well it's no longer farmland people live
there there is attics right here and

16
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,010
what we have we have a hundred and
fourteen feet above sea level right

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,880
there damn up here it's 108 here it's
one 1/4 so the waters not pouring over

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,350
here the waters pouring around the dam
this way because right now the level is

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,780
109 if the top of that levees 108 and
the waters 109 you kind of understand

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,920
what's going on there now let me take
you to the reservoir itself there are

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,079
people that have built homes here they
allow them to build homes inside the

22
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,700
reservoir and these homes are flooded
2500 homes are flooded some of them up

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:00:00,000
to 5 feet deep they build homes instead
of a lake
