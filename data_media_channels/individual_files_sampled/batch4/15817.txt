how does that old saying go again everyone loves a parade and so it is we have award ceremonies and parades for just about everything and everyone Under the Sun but when President Donald Trump suggests staging a US military parade to honor the nation's bravest men and woman Wow just look at how the progressives and the mainstream media lose their collective minds so last summer president Trump attended the Bastille Day Parade in Paris and he was both moved and inspired by all the pomp and circumstance hey who wouldn't be moved it's quite the spectacle did you notice how the French like to line their boulevards with trees folks that's so the Germans can march in the shade anyway president Trump thought that perhaps it would be a jolly idea to have a parade on US soil that pays tribute to the men and women in uniform and by uniform I don't mean a Philadelphia Eagles Jersey those guys had their parade last week but apparently showing gratitude to those who put their lives on the line is a big turn-off well it is for the usual suspects indeed out trotted the comparisons to Hitler Stalin and Kim jong-un yeah because there's absolutely no difference when it comes to the US and Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and modern-day North Korea if the term modern-day North Korea isn't a oxymoron that is the last one is pretty funny too considering how the left just fond over his sister kim yo-jong who also happens to serve as director of north korea's who hate for it propaganda and agitation Department yet surely there's a difference between a military parade staged by a dictatorship and a military parade staged by a Western democracy no apparently check out Douglas Brinkley a presidential historian at Rice University in a Washington Post article he stated what are they going to do stand there while Donald Trump waves at them it smacks of something you see in a totalitarian country unless there's a genuine earnest reason to be doing it is France a totalitarian country CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr offered up some bizarre reasons why a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue might be a bad idea to like those tanks might cause some damage to the asphalt which doesn't seem to be the case in Paris by the way I guess Parisian War roads are better than those in Washington for some reason but infrastructure worries aside star then plays the what-if a display of American patriotism makes America's enemies hate America even more card it may be very reversal the veterans have long wanted some kind of welcome home parade this may be seen as something unduly militaristic overseas may be seen as an expression of celebrating years of America's wars abroad yeah so a military parade in DC will make the Taliban really really really hate America whereas they merely just really really hate America right now naturally over at the morning Schmo on MSNBC the panel also weighed in in a predictable fashion and this is very autocratic and who would ever guess this president would be want a military print can you imagine if it happens though just I mean just as you play it out do the images are gonna be kind of per√≥nist but for a Pernice that but there will be counter protests right this will actually be a thing this is I mean it will not be it will not go will not go off without incidents right there will be out we we just saw the Giants just don't do millet it's military not part of our drayan American tradition no John you're wrong there have been numerous US military parades in American history the last major one taking place in 1991 after the Gulf War involving almost 9,000 troops not to be outdone on this side of the border writing in The Globe and Mail Lawrence Martin called trumped a narcissus for wanting to stage a parade on the political front Democrat Jackie Speier tweeted that the parade loving president is turning into a little Napoleon - time in the trenches donning fatigues are fighting for our country she then accompanied her profound tweet with a caricature of Trump as Napoleon but despite what these nattering nabobs of negativity have to say Trump's plans for a military parade is a political win for the president for starters Trump enjoys strong support from the military and veterans and this will only further bolstered that support meanwhile as most of the mainstream media continues to dump on the idea of staging a parade to celebrate the US military while at the same time fawning over Kim jong-un's sister at the Winter Olympics distrust and disgust of the mainstream media only continue to Royal that's another victory for Trump - so maybe Trump's critics need to be less knee jerk in automatically condemning the president for anything he suggests in fact maybe they need to take a breather and perhaps read The Art of War it seems Trump who has mastered the art of the deal has already done so for the rebel media I'm David the men's Wayne Menzies hee folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
