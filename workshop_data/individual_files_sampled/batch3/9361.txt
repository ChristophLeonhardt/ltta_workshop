JENKINS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST A PREVIEW OF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE TOMORROW NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE LOOK FORWARD SEEING YOU TOMORROW NIGHT ON THE BIG STAGE. NOW WE HAVE WEST VIRGINIA ATTORNEY PATRICK MORRISEY. I JUST WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY AT HOME THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DELAY IN A SINGLE, SO THERE'S GOING TO BE HESITATION BETWEEN MY QUESTIONS AND YOUR ANSWER. THE FIRST OF ALL, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO EVAN JENKINS WHO YOU JUST HEARD? HE SAID YOU WOULDN'T COME AROUND THE, YOU NEVER SUPPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING THE 2016 ELECTION AND DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM ELECTION AND DIDN'T VOTE FOR HI HIM. WELL, LIKE MOST WEST VIRGINIANS KNOW THAT EVAN JENKINS IS JUST REALLY STRETCHING THE TRUTH AT A LEVEL HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE. FIRST, I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE THAT SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP. EVAN JENKINS CANNOT SAY THAT. THAT POSITION IS ACTUALLY RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO ARE REALLY TRUSTED TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT. SO NOT ONLY DID I VOTE FOR HIM IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, I VOTED FOR HIM AT THE CONVENTION. I DID ADS COMPARING MYSELF TO HIM IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN. WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE HERE IS A VERY DESPERATE CANDIDATE EVAN JENKINS, HIS LIBERAL BACKGROUND IS BEING EXPOSED. EVAN LINCOLN JENKINS WAS FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, STUMPED FOR JOHN KERRY, RALLIED FOR HILLARY CLINTON, SUPPORTED NANCY PELOSI. THIS IS A VERY LIBERAL BACKGROUND. I THINK AS MORE WEST VIRGINIANS ARE LEARNING ABOUT MY CONSERVATIVE RECORD, STANDING UP FOR THE UNBORN, MOST PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT I AM THE ONLY ENDORSED CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE BY WEST VIRGINIANS FOR LIFE AND THE SECOND OF THEM IN ALL THE CONSERVATIVES ARE COALESCING BEHIND MY CANDIDACY. AS THAT HAPPENS, I THINK EVAN JENKINS IS JUST GETTING VERY DESPERATE MAKING UP A LOT OF LIES. I THINK FOX DID A VERY GOOD JOB EARLIER TODAY CALLING EVAN JENKINS OUT ON PHOTO SHOPPING AND ADD WHEN EVAN JENKINS WAS THE ONE WHO RALLIED FOR HERE WE CLINTON. I THINK PEOPLE ARE SEEING THROUGH HIS NONSENSE. I THINK NEXT TUESDAY WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A GOOD WIN IF THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA GRANT IT TO US. Martha: YOU GUYS ARE GOING AT EACH OTHER PRETTY HARD. AND PEOPLE WILL SEE IT TOMORROW NIGHT, A VERY INTENSE BATTLE GOING ON IN WEST VIRGINIA. NEITHER ONE OF YOU TWO SEEM TO BE TALKING ABOUT DON BLANKENSHIP. WHY IS THAT? LOOK, I THINK RIGHT NOW I'M PUTTING FORTH MY POSITIVE CONSERVATIVE VISION FOR THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA. I THINK YOU ARE SEEING BOTH OUT OF DON BLANKENSHIP AND EVAN JENKINS ARE A LOT OF THE ATTACK ADS. WE HAD A LOT OF POSITIVE ADS UP. WE HAVE SOME CONTRAST AS WELL. BUT I AM EMPHASIZING MY RECORD BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE RACE THAT HAS THE PROVEN CONSERVATIVE RECORD AND THE CONSERVATIVE ENDORSEMENTS. I THINK LATE LAST WEEK WITH SENATOR TED CRUZ COMING ON BOARD, SENATOR RAND PAUL. OBVIOUSLY ALL THE MAJOR CONSERVATIVE LEADERS IN THE STATE ARE RALLYING BEHIND MY CANDIDACY. THAT IS WHY WE PROJECT A VERY POSITIVE VISION THAT DON BLANKENSHIP CAN. Martha: WE WILL SEE. BEAGLE HE HAS A VERY DEEP LIBERAL PAST. Martha: I PROMISE YOU YOU WILL HAVE MORE TIME TOMORROW NIGHT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU ALL ON STAGE, ALL OF THESE GENTLEMEN WHO HOPE TO BEAT JOE MANCHIN IN TURN WEST VIRGINIA INTO A REPUBLICAN SENATE STATE, SO WE'LL SEE HOW THIS TURNS OUT. DON'T MISS IT. TOMORROW NIGHT, WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR DEBATE.
