regardless of whether President Trump said the asshole word or not we're all deluding ourselves if we think there's no such thing as an asshole on planet Earth as a matter of fact there's even a cottage industry that dines out on reviewing assholes so why are so many losing their minds things to Trump allegedly uttering this word well the usual suspects recently went into yet another rabid PC frenzy after Trump allegedly called some country's assholes because they are well assholes I guess this reaction from the progressives shouldn't come as a huge surprise hey in Canada we can no longer refer to barbarism as barbarism that might be culturally insensitive and if you have the audacity to protest homegrown Isis fighters returning to Canada well then you're obviously a white supremacist or an islamaphobe or both hey just gasps those Trudeau peein liberals so I guess it stands the reason that one cannot refer to an asshole as an asshole even if the place is an asshole because that would be I don't know judgmental or maybe brutally honest and no sir can't have that not these days and yet perusing the men's ID in library the other day I came across a couple of books that satirize the whole thing for example crap vacations 50 tales of hell on earth and then there's 101 places not to see before you die both are really good for a laugh but here's the really funny thing when it comes to crappy places not all of them are in the developing world oh sure incretion there are numerous third world places reviews such as kuta Indonesia and the youngest road in Bolivia and Sen Salvador El Salvador but there are s holes to be found closer to home tombs such as Daytona Beach Florida as the author notes quote the tourists who come to visit seem to love the place somehow they managed to not see the hordes of homeless people sleeping rough anywhere they can find and crapping wherever they feel the urge the spring breakers who descend every year spewed noise alcohol and vomit all over the town end quote hey there's even some Canadian content namely Venice and Quebec the author describes this destination as follows quote our chalet turned out to be one in a line of shed like structures that resembled the abandoned outhouses that littered the horizon after the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl the beach was an oil slick boat launch ramp across an exceedingly busy roadway the pool was essentially a dirty paddling pool that stood four feet off the ground as we headed to the office to register we watched as some slob stood atop a miniscule poolside diving platform chewed the last few kernels from Miss heavily buttered cob of corn toss it into the grass and then toppled into the water end quote oh nice indeed in 101 places not to see before you die author Katherine price points to Times Square in New York on New Year's Eve now that should be on everyone's to avoid lists you see it looks like party central on TV folks but what you can't see is how cold it is how there are no food vendors how you can't leave your spot because you won't get back and worst of all the dearth of bathrooms quote that's right nearly a million people crowd into Times Square every New Year's Eve some of whom arrived some 12 hours before the ball drops and yet the city provides no additional facilities in the words of one former New York cop if you want to survive New Year's in Times Square you'd better have the bladder of a camel end quote the point is there are asshole places all over the globe and calling a place that does not make one a bigot or a racist nor does it mean that the people who populate those places are less than in any way and let's be honest here we've all used this sort of pejorative language in the past to describe truly awful places and why shouldn't we an asshole is an asshole for reasons that range from stress and sickness to danger and exploitation so how about cutting the president some slack for speaking with such brutal honesty assuming that is he actually used such language in the first place for the rebel media I'm David the man Zoid Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
