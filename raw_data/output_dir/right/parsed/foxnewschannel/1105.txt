CONFERENCE.
"NEW YORK TIMES" AUTHOR RAYMOND
HERE TO EXPLAIN.
THIS HAS BEEN WILD.
>> THE EAGLES WON THE SUPER BOWL
OBVIOUSLY.
THE WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO HONOR
THEM.
THE WHITE HOUSE FELT THE RUG WAS
PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM.
80 PLAYERS SAID WE WILL ATTEND
AND AT THE LAST-MINUTE SAID 2
PLAYERS WILL ATTEND AND THE
MASCOT AND THE COACH.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID NO WE ARE
NOT DOING THAT.
COACH PETERSON IS TRYING TO
EXPLAIN.

DOWN AND BEING RECOGNIZED AD
WORLD CHAMPIONS.

INCREDIBLE.
>> I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT MUCH
DOUBLE SPEAK SINCE JOY REID
TRIED TO EXPLAIN THOSE BLOG
ENTRIES.
IF THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO

ENDED.

NASTY PEOPLE SAID SHE WAS
ABUSED.
HE SAID IMAGINE IF THE PRESIDENT
PUNCHED HER.
THE PRESIDENT SALUTED THE FIRST
LADY TODAY.
>> SHE WENT THROUGH A ROUGH
PATCH, BUT HE IS DOING GREAT.
WE ARE PROUD OF HER.
THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY LOVE
YOU.
THANK YOU, HONEY.

PUTS THE GUN AWAY AND SHRUGS AND
GOES BACK TO HIS BEER.
