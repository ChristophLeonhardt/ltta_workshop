so we've got a couple of Democrats who we were concerned or were a little corporate not as progressive as we wanted them to be now we wanted him to beat the monsters they were running against in the general elections in the case of Northland in Virginia he was running against Edie cholesky Yui surround the Republican Party and then did a really ugly campaign Gillespie did so thrilled that he lost enormous relief that Roy Moore lost down in Alabama but as I said on on the night of doug jones victory it wasn't so much like yay doug jones is gonna change the world as much as it is was just relief that we didn't elect someone as heinous as Roy Moore so some people actually got on me they're like oh you should be super excited about doug jones all right i you know you get excited about whoever you like okay you don't tell me we were getting excited about so what was my point of concern my point of concern was the stories I'm about to tell you that they weren't really progressive and and that would create issues so on Northam he was very clear let's go to HuffPost for this story Northam said that he would focus on governing in a bipartisan way and would not try to engineer a democratic this is after he wins of course don't get me wrong bipartisan way would not try to engineer a democratic advantage in Virginia House of Delegates where Republicans currently hold on one seat majority now so this that's the least offensive part about about what I'm about to tell you but it's still really really grating and annoying so Virginia is kind of a purple state and that's why we weren't exactly sure who's gonna win Democrats have wanted a lot lately but and they made up a lot of ground that's why the problems only have one seat left at one seat advantage left in their House of Delegates but so if he says I'm gonna run things that are bipartisan way that's fairly normal talk after you win an election I'm gonna represent everybody so I have no problem with that but when he says that he is not going to try to take engineer Democratic advantage in the state I say why not you're the Democratic governor of Virginia I'm pretty sure that if Gillespie had won he would try to engineer overwhelming Republican advantage in the state forever that's what and by the way I wouldn't blame him for that he's a Republican you're supposed to be a Democrat you're supposed to fight for us but of course right after the election the surrender begins okay but it's about to get much worse Northam moderate democrat as they explain who twice voted for george w bush in presidential elections also told the post he's concerned about the fiscal impact of Medicaid in his state wait a minute okay wait a minute on two things I wanna if you didn't know ya Northam voted for Bush against Al Gore and against John Kerry Northam this so-called democratic savior thought George Bush nailed it in his first term and voted for him for a second term so you shouldn't be surprised by any of this duplicity and lack of firmness but you know the establishment things so he's just our guy but more importantly the heart of this story did you just say that he's worried about the fiscal impact of Medicaid wait a minute I thought you spent the whole campaign fighting for Medicaid that is the part of the reason that you won huge part of the reason in fact I don't just remember I still have the commercials so this is the stuff he was saying during the campaign watch they deserve every day we don't expand Medicaid we use my you know to surrender states that we're competing with if there's a bitch suppose who wants to give away I had made out of the day I will tell you all right excellent they need their head examined if they're not going to expand Medicaid wonderful okay in fact people for Bernie just tweeted out something wait a minute it says here's Ralph Northam calling anyone who thinks Virginia shouldn't expand Medicaid needs their head examined as you saw in the video for yourself today he walked back this promise say it was me of course of course he did he's a corporate conservative Democrat he was never gonna expand Medicaid I was just stuff he told you because he knows being progressive wins elections after the elections then you turn around to your donors and go what would you like well what do you need folks I already tricked them I'm done with them more from the Washington Post now Northam said he has no plans to try to force Republicans to accept a broad expansion of Medicaid oh god forbid you would force other party to do anything instead he has begun talks with lawmakers in both parties about overhauling the state's Medicaid system to expand access to health care while better defining eligibility to control costs they're not gonna expand Medicaid the Republicans in Virginia aren't gonna agree to that when he says he's not gonna go after the Republicans instead he's going to agree with them that means that he's focusing on the second half of that sentence while better defining eligibility meaning making sure that less people are eligible in order to quote control costs he's gonna cut it not expand it and then they tell us like way guys what do you get all upset over man just bow your heads and vote for corporate Democrats and send all your money and get all excited about them and make it are they ever gonna deliver on policies no of course not just bow your heads already so look once he got the Gillespie yes he's way better than Gillespie yes Gillespie's terrible okay but that's why primaries matter and so I very yellow ran a good campaign against him I wish he'd won and he didn't that's okay it is what it is but for God's sake get out there and vote in the primaries if you want progresses to represent you then vote for progressives and nowadays with the Democratic establishment as it is your only chances in the primaries so they give all the advantages and all the money to their corporate guys this one is so bad that even one of Hillary's top aides on her campaign was disgusted by it Wow you got work extra hard to get Hillary people mad at you so here's Brian Fallon tweeting this is a cell phone in three steps by the way not a cell phone a cell phone okay one campaign on expanding Medicaid to win sweeping victory three voluntarily retreat from campaign promise well Brian you're absolutely right about that bless your heart for tweeting that and that about describes the entire Democratic establishment for the last twenty years almost every time so it is greatly disheartening okay now that's Northam for you and so of course he's not going to do what he promised you the study's gonna serve as donors now let's go to doug jones the the hero of alabama now i'm super glad you won cuz Rome or was the worst of the worst I wish there was someone in Alabama they could have done a progressive challenge to him in the primaries I believe that a progressive would have won easier okay I know that the Democratic establishment will never agree to that oh no they need to be super conservative but it doesn't matter I loved it because at least Rory Jones took on a predator and defeated that predator so that guy who was harassing young girls and women wouldn't be in office so I know that he cares a lot about that issue but what's weird is what he said right after he won let's watch do you agree with senator Booker that President Trump should resign because of these allegations you know Jake where I am on that right now is that those allegations were made before the election and so people had an opportunity to judge before that election I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues let's get on with the real issues that are facing people of this country right now and and I don't think that the president authorized on at this point we'll see how things go there's other things out there but I think at this point we need to move on and and try to work with some real issues that are facing the country and not worry about getting at odds with the president any more than we have to oh no no you wouldn't want to get at odds with the president when you're in the opposite party no no no god forbid now why don't you just bow your head to them great great we have bold progressive senator from Alabama and now that I want my campaign based on my opponent being a sexual predator I'm done caring about the issue so the president's that say also the sexual predator don't care not my issue well that's awfully convenient now let's just be careful here does he have the same standard for everybody well earlier this month as how posts reports Jones called on senator Al Franken to resign over mounting groping allegations against them but wait you said that if the voters decide to elect some when we're done with it Franken was elected and then you but he's got to go so you think the Democrats should resign okay fair enough but the Republican should not resign because you want to talk about real issues so when you were thrown out Franken under a bus maybe justifiably so well and that helped your political career and you are happy to do that you thought it was a real issue when you were running astroid more you thought it was such a real issue almost all your ads were about it but now that you're safely ensconced in the Senate or going to be now all of a sudden not a real issue funny how that works we think it's a real issue that's why we've got this petition going TYT Network comm slash resign that says now that senator Al Franken has resigned for inappropriate behavior towards women president Donald Trump must also resign for worse behavior toward women apparently Doug Jones did not sign that petition because he's done carrying about the issue if you have progressives who are uncorrupted by corporate pac money they will serve you if you have corporate Democrats no matter what they promise you before an election they will always serve the donor class I'm not the bad guy for pointing that out they're the bad guys for actually doing it I'm only the messenger you
