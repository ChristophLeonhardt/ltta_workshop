>> Melissa: ON MEMORIAL DAY

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,188
2007 AND ARMY TROOPS DEPLOYED IN

3
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,023
IRAQ WENT ON AN EMERGENCY RESCUE

4
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,526
MISSION WHEN THEY WERE SUDDENLY

5
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:21,893
AMBUSHED.

6
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:26,464
SIX SOLDIERS DIED IN THE ATTACK.

7
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:27,198
TIM LIVED THROUGH THAT MISSION

8
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:29,400
AND ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY, THE

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,903
HOMETOWN HERO WAS ASKED TO BE A

10
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:32,937
GRAND MARSHAL IN HIS SMALL TOWN

11
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,139
OF HIGHLANDS NEW JERSEY.

12
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:35,840
TIM AGREED BUT UNDER THE

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,208
CONDITION THAT THE REST OF HIS

14
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,976
BROTHERS BE THERE TOO.

15
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:41,412
WITH THE HELP OF GO FUND ME THE

16
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:45,983
TOWN GOT THE TROOPS BACK

17
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,919
TOGETHER AND IF ONLY YOU WERE

18
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:50,822
THERE TO CAPTURE THEIR REUNION

19
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:51,723
11 YEARS LATER.

20
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:55,093
>> IT'S UNDESCRIBABLE.

21
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:55,860
LOSING FRIENDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,863
YOU AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DO

23
00:00:58,863 --> 00:00:59,797
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

24
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:02,967
WE LOST SIX THAT DAY.

25
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,536
>> IT WAS A DARK MISSION.

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,606
DOWN AIRCRAFT RECOVERY MISSION

27
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,441
AND THEY GAVE US THE LOCATION TO

28
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:14,112
GO, AND WE WENT AND WE GOT

29
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:16,381
AMBUSHED ON THE WAY THERE AND

30
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:21,786
LOST A FEW GUYS AND I DIDN'T

31
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:22,487
EVEN KNOW IT WAS MEMORIAL DAY

32
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:26,391
UNTIL WE GOT BACK.

33
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:27,125
>> MEMORIAL DAY, IT WAS A TOUGH

34
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,393
DAY FOR ALL OF US.

35
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:30,795
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT

36
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,897
JUST KIND OF PUNCHES YOU IN THE

37
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:36,134
STOMACH AND TAKES THE BREATH

38
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:36,701
AWAY.

39
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,435
BUT LUCKILY I'VE GOT SOME GOOD

40
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:42,073
TROOPERS OVER THERE TO HELP US

41
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:43,174
ALL THROUGH IT.

42
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:45,676
TIMMY STANDING BY US, GETTING US

43
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:46,110
ALTOGETHER.

44
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,913
IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT

45
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:49,514
EASIER.

46
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:50,381
>> THE COMMANDER OF THE

47
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,349
AMERICAN LEGION CALLED ME UP ONE

48
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,484
DAY AND ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO

49
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:58,689
DO IT AND I WASN'T SURE IF I DID

50
00:01:58,689 --> 00:01:59,090
DO IT AND I WASN'T SURE IF I DI

51
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,558
DID.

52
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:01,325
I DON'T EVER WANT TO DO STUFF ON

53
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:04,295
THAT DAY, IT'S VERY PERSONAL AND

54
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:06,497
WHEN HE SAID GRAND MARSHAL, I

55
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:09,866
SAID LET ME GET BACK TO YOU AND

56
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,568
I CALLED UP SOME OF THE GUYS

57
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:14,605
THAT I WAS WITH ON THAT

58
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:16,274
MEMORIAL DAY.

59
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:19,177
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY KNEW

60
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,345
THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A BIGGER

61
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:21,979
PARADE THAN ANYTHING THAT

62
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,682
THEY'VE SEEN.

63
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:25,683
>> WE ARE BROTHERS.

64
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,318
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

65
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:27,885
COMBAT VETS.

66
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:28,553
WE ALWAYS STICK TOGETHER.

67
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:30,888
WE ALWAYS HAVE EACH OTHER'S

68
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:31,189
BACK.

69
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:35,526
SO IT WAS AN HONOR.

70
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:37,495
>> MEMORIAL DAY, IT'S A TOUGH

71
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:37,762
DAY.

72
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:39,797
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO GO OUT

73
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:40,665
THERE AND ENJOY THEMSELVES AND

74
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:41,933
BARBECUE IT UP AND MAYBE HAVE A

75
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:46,037
FEW AND THAT'S FINE, BUT I LIKE

76
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:49,073
TO REMEMBER, NOT JUST FOR THE

77
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:51,275
PEOPLE THAT WE LOST, BUT THE

78
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:51,909
PEOPLE BEFORE US.

79
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:52,844
WE ARE PRETTY FORTUNATE TO BE IN

80
00:02:52,844 --> 00:02:54,312
A PLACE THAT WE ARE AT AND IT'S

81
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:55,513
BECAUSE OF THEM THAT WE ARE ABLE

82
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:57,715
TO DO A LOT OF STUFF THAT WE ARE

83
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:58,916
ABLE TO DO TODAY.

84
00:02:58,916 --> 00:02:59,884
>> IT'S NOT VETERANS DAY, IT'S A

85
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:02,353
DAY WHERE WE REMEMBER THOSE WHO

86
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:04,088
DIED IN THE SERVICE OF OUR

87
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:04,689
COUNTRY.

88
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,390
>> I HAVEN'T LOOKED FORWARD TO A

89
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,960
MEMORIAL DAY IN 11 YEARS BECAUSE

90
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,496
THERE'S BILLBOARDS, THOSE RADIO

91
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:12,697
COMMERCIALS.

92
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:16,701
MEMORIAL DAY SALE, MEMORIAL DAY

93
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:17,401
GIVEAWAY AND IT'S JUST A LOT

94
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:20,071
MORE SOMBER FOR ME.

95
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,339
IT'S A DAY OF HONOR, IT'S NOT A

96
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:24,108
DAY OF SUMMER.

97
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,877
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE FORGET THAT.

98
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:26,878
>> THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE

99
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:27,812
I'VE GOT MY BROTHERS HERE.

100
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:29,280
I HAVEN'T SEEN SOME OF THESE

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,516
GUYS IN ABOUT TEN, SOME PEOPLE

102
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:31,983
ABOUT 12 YEARS.

103
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:34,619
SO BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM, IT

104
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:37,488
REALLY MAKES ME HAPPY.

105
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:41,492
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN.

106
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,260
>> MY FRIEND JONATHAN, HIS WIFE

107
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,828
AND HIS SON ARE COMING AND HE

108
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,931
NEVER GOT TO KNOW HIS SON.

109
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:51,435
HE WAS TOO YOUNG WHEN WE

110
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:51,802
DEPLOYED.

111
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:54,505
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO LET

112
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,241
HIS SON KNOW WHO HE WAS.

113
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,610
AND HE'S GOING TO LEAD THE

114
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,314
PARADE, INCLUDING THE TRIBUTE.

115
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:04,582
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR US, IT'S VERY

116
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:05,516
PERSONAL FOR US AND THAT'S WHY

117
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:09,620
WE WANT THIS PARADE TO BE

118
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,188
PERSONAL AND WE WANT TO REMIND

119
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:14,358
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF WHAT

120
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:19,029
MEMORIAL DAY IS SUPPOSED TO BE.
