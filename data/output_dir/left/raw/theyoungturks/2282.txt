1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,320
FACEBOOK WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
THAT IT RAN A CERTAIN SURVEY

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,010
ASKING IF MEN SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO REQUEST SEXUAL PICTURES

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,820
FROM UNDER AGED GIRLS.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,719
JONATHAN HAYNES IS THE STORY THE
STARTS WITH.

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,100
HE IS A DIGITAL EDITOR AT THE
GUARDIAN AND WAS ON

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:27,259
FACEBOOK AND GOT THIS POP UP.

7
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:43,540
AND HERE WAS THE QUESTION HE WAS
FACED WITH.

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:01:08,040
>>THE LAST ONE IS MY FAVORITE.

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,030
GROWN MEN LOOKING AT SEXUAL
PICTURES OF 14-YEAR-OLD

10
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,410
GIRLS, I HAVE NO PREFERENCE ON
THAT TOPIC.

11
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:23,450
>> HE ASKED THIS DIGITAL EDITOR
IS MAKING IT SECRET THE

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,210
BEST FACEBOOK CAN OFFER HERE?

13
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,060
NOT CALLING THE POLICE.

14
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,530
CITY LAWS FIGURE HERE AS
BEING QUITE IMPORTANT ON

15
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,970
DETERMINING ROLES?

16
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,610
>>FACEBOOK DOES NOT DENY THIS
WAS A SURVEY.

17
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,890
THEY SAY YES IT WAS, IT WAS A
MISTAKE AND WE WILL PULL IT

18
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,890
DOWN.

19
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,189
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WERE DOING
IT.

20
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,770
I WILL TELL YOU FACEBOOK IS A
PARTNER OF OURS, SO I AM

21
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,540
JUST KEEPING IT REAL.

22
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:58,180
YOU HOPE IT WAS SOME SORT OF
THING LIKE IF YOU ANSWERED

23
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,829
YES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT,
BUT IT WAS THEN REPORTED TO

24
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,700
THE AUTHORITIES.

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,080
BY THE WAY I'M NOT SURE THEY
SHOULD DO THAT EITHER.

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,240
BUT MY POINT BEING IS THERE
MIGHT'VE BEEN ANOTHER

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,250
REASON, BUT IF THERE IS THEY
SHOULD SHARE BECAUSE IT

28
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,250
LOOKS REALLY BAD.

29
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,600
>>HERE IS WHAT I THINK IS
HAPPENING.

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,930
YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE ñ IT GOES
INTO ITALICS AFTER THE : IN

31
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,790
THE QUESTION.

32
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,050
I AM ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT
THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY

33
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:44,010
QUESTIONS THEY ARE ASKED ON
SURVEYS.

34
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,490
THEY ARE JUST COLLECTING DATA ON
HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE THIS ISSUE.

35
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,690
AND THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING
THAT WE CAN REALLY CONCLUDE

36
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,400
FROM THAT DATA, BUT THEY ARE
JUST GATHERING IT.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,800
IF I AM CHOOSING WHICH DATA
COLLECTION PRACTICE FACEBOOK

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,230
DOES, I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE
ONE FOR ME.

39
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:16,250
I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE
CREEPY STUFF IN GOOGLE.

40
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:24,500
THAT IS THE MORE DATA ENTRY
HERE, THE JOKE RESPONSE I HAD TO

41
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,120
IT YOU KNOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE
SO MUCH IS UNCERTAIN AS TO

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,160
HOW PEOPLE FEEL.

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,790
MAYBE FACEBOOK WAS LIKE AS CHILD
PORN STILL WEIRD TO PEOPLE?

44
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,610
HOPEFULLY YOU WILL SAY IT IS
BAD.

45
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,140
>>AND FACEBOOK MIGHT ALSO ñ
THEY ARE DEALING WITH HUMANITY

46
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,480
HERE AS WE ALL ARE ON THE
INTERNET.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:54,700
WHAT I MEAN IS THE INTERNET
ALLOWS FOR MORE UNVARNISHED SIDE

48
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,560
OF HUMANITY.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,450
THE INTERNET ALSO ALLOWS FOR
WONDERFUL THINGS TO HAPPEN.

50
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:10,020
FACEBOOK, DEALING WITH ALL THIS
INCOMING MADNESS OF THE ID

51
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:18,269
OF HUMANITY, MAYBE IT IS TRYING
TO SORT IT OUT.

52
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:25,050
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK IS
ACCEPTABLE AND NOT.

53
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,060
WHAT ARE THE COLORS?

54
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,440
>>CHILD GROOMING ON FACEBOOK.

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,690
THEY REGULARLY WORK WITH THE
POLICE TO MAKE SURE ANYONE

56
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,380
ACTING IN SUCH A WAY IS BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE.

57
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,840
>>AND IT IS ILLEGAL, RIGHT?

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,840
HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT, IT WAS
DEFINITELY A MISTAKE.

59
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,060
IF SOMEONE WERE TO HIRE SOMEONE
ELSE ON FACEBOOK TO ASSASSINATE

60
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,690
YOUR WIFE, WOULD THAT BE
ACCEPTABLE AND HOW MUCH?

61
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:12,340
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, THAT IS
CRAZY.

62
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,100
>>AND THEY ARE VERY LEGALISTIC.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:22,070
YOU CAN SEE THE LEGAL FRAMINGS
OF ALL THESE OPTIONS.

64
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,550
AND IF YOU LOOK AT SEX
TRAFFICKING LAWS THAT PROTECT

65
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,160
FORUMS FROM PROSECUTION AND
BACKPAGE AND FACEBOOK FALLS

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,710
UNDER THIS, ALSO CRAIGSLIST
WHERE IT IS THIS WEIRD ARCHAIC

67
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,790
VERSION OF PROTECTING FORUMS.

68
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,950
THEY ARE LEGLESS AND, WE ARE
LIKE THE PHONE COMPANY.

69
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,920
YOU DON'T GET MAD AT THE PHONE
COMPANY WHEN SOMEONE MAKES

70
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,370
A CALL TO WHAT HITMAN?

71
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,940
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET MAD AT
FACEBOOK WHEN SOMEONE ASKED

72
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,960
FOR A CHILD PORN PICTURE RIGHT?

73
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,310
YOU'RE GOING TO GO AFTER THE
PERSON WHO ASKED FOR THE

74
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,310
PICTURE.

75
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,870
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT BUILT
INTO THIS THAT I CAN SEE

76
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,110
FROM THE DIFFERENT WAYS IT IS
PUT.

77
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,140
THAT AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE
FAKE NEWS EPIDEMIC WHEN FACEBOOK

78
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:12,620
IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
DO PEOPLE WANT TO SEE?

79
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,770
AND HOW MUCH OF THEIR AGAINST
WHAT WE ARE ALREADY DOING.

80
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,900
AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES YOU
SEE THINGS THAT END UP LIKE

81
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,520
THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING
TO FIND A TECHNOLOGICAL

82
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,830
SOLUTION TO SOMETHING THAT
REQUIRES A LOT OF EMOTIONAL

83
00:06:26,830 --> 00:00:00,000
INTELLIGENCE TO FIGURE OUT.
