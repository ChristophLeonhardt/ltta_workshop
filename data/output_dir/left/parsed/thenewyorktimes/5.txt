Florida.
Singing: “Sunshine
and sea breeze,
soft sand and palm trees.”
Retirement mecca,
party central, Little Haiti,
Little Havana —
a state with elections
so close, they’re legendary.
And in 2018, Florida is
living up to its reputation,
with a tight
governor’s race catering
to political extremes.
A lefty mayor
from Tallahassee —
“Are y’all ready to flip
Florida blue —”
versus a Trump-loving
former congressman.
“Make America great again.”
The result could
be a litmus test
for where the state, and
maybe even the country,
are headed in 2020.
So, who are the candidates?
This is the Democrat,
Mayor Andrew Gillum.
He pulled off a surprise
victory in the primary,
beating out six
other candidates.
“My wife refers to
me as Seabiscuit.”
Gillum’s got that
made-for-media
inspiring back story.
He’s one of
seven kids, the first
to graduate from
high school and college,
and he was the youngest
person ever elected
to the Tallahassee
City Commission.
Gillum could be Florida’s
first black governor.
He’s become a bit
of a national star,
even securing cartoon
cameos in music videos.
But he’s also wrapped up
in some controversies:
“An ongoing corruption probe,
since you’ve been mayor.”
“We want to make sure
that any individual that
participated in that is
held fully accountable.”
The Republican, Ron DeSantis: 
He made a name for himself
by appearing on Fox News —
a lot.
“Put up or shut up.”
DeSantis, a self-described
conservative warrior,
has impressed many
Republicans, including Trump.
“A tough, brilliant cookie.”
He’s got
Ivy League credentials
and served in the military.
“JAG officer.”
DeSantis went to
Congress in 2012,
but recently resigned so he
could focus on his campaign.
He’s also had some
stumbles, like when
he said this about Gillum the
morning after the primaries:
“You know he is an
articulate spokesman
for those far-left views.
The last thing we need to
do is to monkey this up.”
Yeah.
It drew accusations of
a racist dog whistle.
So, what about the issues?
DeSantis has endorsed
almost every Trump policy,
from repealing the
Affordable Care Act
to moving the U.S. Embassy
to Jerusalem.
He also hates tax increases
and so-called sanctuary cities.
Gillum:
He might be the most liberal
candidate for governor
in Florida’s history.
He wants to overhaul I.C.E.,
raise the minimum wage
and fight the N.R.A.
Polls show that
both messages are
getting pretty good
reception in Florida.
So yeah, of course, the
race is neck and neck.
“This is Florida.
The rules are different here.”
