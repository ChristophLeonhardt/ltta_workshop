wondering about whether it's okay and

24
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,579
that is selfies from the moment we go to

constantly on our own lives that's what

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,939
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> taught to do the magic of</font>

literacy and the ability to read and

because I a superior person you'll know

that Winston the main character works in

47
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,369
the Ministry of Truth where he is

48
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,680
categorically going through records and

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,979
changing what somebody's record was of

their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> life newspapers records</font>

51
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:55,680
everything is really scary records are

an integral part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our society they're</font>

what they're what build it there what

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,649
maintain it and it's not just so other

55
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:02,759
people in the future can look back on

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,710
our society<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually keeping records is</font>

57
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,560
part of us existing it's part of keeping

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">a say that's part of solidifying us in a</font>

59
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,760
moment and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the writing</font>

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,520
kind of literacy

61
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,370
that's important it's also as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

62
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,950
progress using technologies like I am

63
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,480
also illiterate because I can touch

64
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,250
tight I'm also literate in our society

65
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,860
because I can use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sat Nav kind of not</font>

66
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,780
only can i read the names of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tube</font>

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,390
all fit together and I know how to

change and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the symbols and</font>

72
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,720
another way of recording yourself isn't

73
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,010
just writing down how you're feeling

74
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,150
writing down what you're doing but it's

75
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,580
also recording how you look historically

76
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,130
this was the power that only the richest

77
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,230
people in society had they had to pay

78
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,510
people to paint portraits of them to get

79
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,310
that down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as we progress</font>

inventive cameras expensive rich people

82
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,610
get portraits taken of the poor people

83

anymore a simple camera phone is

88
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,790
probably one of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> affordable</font>

89
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,340
luxuries of our time and it means that

90
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">we as people can record whatever we do</font>

91
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,900
it's changed the way the proletariat can

interact with each other and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also with</font>

93

police brutality happens in protests

95
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,490
we're recording when things are going

wrong recording disasters we're

97
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,700
recording when people get harassed at

otherwise be completely invisible to

somebody who wasn't actually present at

101

<font color="#CCCCCC">that moment selfies are a key part of</font>

102
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,900
where we came from when you look at the

103
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,120
gathering momentum behind what has

104
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,280
produced our ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a selfie</font>

105
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually really important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

perfect but also spend a lot of time

112
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,720
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look perfect is ridiculous</font>

113
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520
everything is transient if you like the

way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look today that's going to go</font>

115

away pretty soon you might want to

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,850
record that if you feel today like

117
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,620
you've managed to externalise something

118
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,600
internal about you with your makeup or

119
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,280
your hair or your clothes or your face

120
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh you might want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to record that because</font>

it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard like adjectives are</font>

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,560
some time

127
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,840
shit they were shit as colors there is

illiterate when it comes to our own

130

expressed yourself with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like</font>
