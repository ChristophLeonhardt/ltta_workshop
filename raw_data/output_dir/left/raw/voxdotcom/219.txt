1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,800
This is a picture of a song.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
Its fingerprint.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,670
Its visual identity.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,829
It was generated by a tool that visualizes
matching data.

5
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:14,480
And it reveals something really cool about
how a song can be structured around lyrical

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
repetition.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,660
By the way, this is Vince Staples “Yeah
Right”, and it’s been stuck in my head

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,250
for months.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,681
Boy yeah right yeah right yeah right.

10
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:28,710
Boy yeah right yeah right yeah right.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,810
This is Colin Morris.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,789
He’s a computer programmer that who loves
pop music.

13
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,410
I did a master's degree in computational linguistics.

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,120
Colin created this tool called Song Sim.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,780
Each row
and each

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,160
column is a

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,160
word

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,399
in a song from beginning to end.

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,399
But the interesting

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,399
thing

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,399
is when

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,399
you see these

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,399
structures

24
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,399
off

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,399
the diagonal.

26
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,070
Those moments off the diagonal represent some
form of repetition.

27
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,870
I think my favorite example and one of the
earliest ones that I played with was Bad Romance

28
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,530
by Lady Gaga.

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,199
one of the coolest things about this song
is just how many different hooks she manages

30
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,450
to squeeze into it.

31
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:13,650
Ra ra ah ah ah roma roma ma gaga oh la la
want your bad romance.

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,530
Depending on how you count, there are at least
five different lyrical themes that repeat

33
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,550
to the point where you start running out of
words to describe them.

34
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,860
Usually verses aren’t that repetitive.

35
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,840
Here, they are.

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,590
The only part of the song that is falls into
a traditional song structure is the bridge.

37
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,950
And it really stands out.

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,340
Still, though, it’s highly repetitive.

39
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,640
Walk walk fashion baby work move that bitch
crazy.

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,440
Bad Romance came out in 2009 and since then
some of biggest pop songs every year have

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,210
only gotten more repetitive.

42
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,590
We’ll get back to this chart but first,
I want to get something out of the way.

43
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:58,770
I really really really really really really
like you and I want you do you want me to?

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,770
Yes that’s true.

45
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,780
But not exactly what I want to say.

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,920
You see, there’s always been a pretty strong
sentiment that if a song is structured around

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,260
excessive repetition it’s uncreative, it's
unchallenging or it lacks complexity.

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,849
That anti repetition sentiment goes back a
laughably long time.

49
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:22,939
All the way back to November 6, 1882 when
composer Ferdinand Praeger gave a case against

50
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:28,640
repetition called “On the fallacy of the
repetition of parts in the classical form.”

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,739
Here’s what he said:

52
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,400
All will readily admit that a first impression,
however striking, is weakened when followed

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,010
by an immediate repetition.

54
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,459
Would ever a poet think of repeating half
of his poem; a

55
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,950
dramatist a whole act; a novelist a whole
chapter ? Such a

56
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,609
proposition would be at once rejected as childish.

57
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:53,130
Why should it be otherwise with music?

58
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,709
Praeger believed repetition was beneath music
when in fact, repetition is decidedly musical.

59
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,720
There's this phenomenon called the speech
to song illusion.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,969
Have you run across that?

61
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,319
That’s Elizabeth Margulis.

62
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,670
She directs the Music Cognition Lab at the
University of Arkansas and has written a book

63
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,499
on musical repetition.

64
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:16,540
There’s this really interesting process
where you can take a little bit of speech,

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,599
you can take a little bit of speech, you can
take a little bit of speech.

66
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:29,400
Repeat it a number of times and for many people
what initially just sounded like somebody

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,290
talking to you now sounds like somebody singing.

68
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,480
Psychologist Diana Deutsch discovered this
illusion in 1995 ironically when she was editing

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,590
the audio of her CD 'Musical Illusions and
Paradoxes'.

70
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,799
Margulis’ music cognition lab has conducted
a number of studies on repetition but there’s

71
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,180
one that is really is pretty fascinating.

72
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,959
She selected music from renowned 20th century
composer, Elliot Carter whose work was is

73
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:04,400
atonal and explicitly non-repetitive.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,950
She presented a few versions to a class of
33 students who were unfamiliar with the work.

75
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,029
One version was the original, no alterations.

76
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:17,660
The other two versions were digitally altered
just to be repetitive without regard for the

77
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:24,680
aesthetic quality of the music.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:36,450
And it turned out that the excerpts that had
been kind of adulterated to insert this literal

79
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,120
kind of repetition were viewed not only as
more enjoyable and more interesting but also

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,860
was more likely to have been composed by human
artists rather than randomly generated by

81
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
computer.

82
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,750
So repetition in music not only feels intentional
to our brains we actually enjoy it.

83
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,390
Let’s take a look at that chart you saw
earlier.

84
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,430
It illustrates that our love of repetition
was increasingly reflected in pop music.

85
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,750
I was surprised by how clear the trend was.

86
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,700
Oh yeah, Colin made that too.

87
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,870
It turned out that you could basically take
any 10 year period over the last 50 years

88
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,100
and there would always be an increase in repetition
over those 10 years.

89
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,030
Yes, pop songs have gotten more repetitive,
But repetition can be used to flip predictable

90
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,160
song structures to make them completely unpredictable.

91
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,460
And that’s really cool.

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,350
I don't know if you saw the visualization
for "Formation" by Beyonce?

93
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,510
Oh yes.

94
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,570
Okay ladies now let's get in formation

95
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,630
It's almost like two songs glued together.

96
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,520
With the first half of the song you have this
very clear chorus.

97
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:58,110
My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole make a

98
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,110
Texas bama

99
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,500
Once you get to the second half - that hook
disappears and Beyonce replaces it with this

100
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,420
catchy hyper repetitive chant.

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,850
Cause I slay (okay)
I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay),

102
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,930
I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay),
I slay (okay)

103
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,050
You can't deny the power of this song.

104
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,370
Repetition doesn't just make it memorable,
it reinforces its central message.

105
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,370
But when I listen to "Yeah Right" by Vince
Staples I'm reminded of the speech to song

106
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,370
illusion.

107
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,900
When Vince repeats Yeah Right over twenty
times,I start to shift my focus from the meaning

108
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,360
of the lyric to the rhythm and musicality
of it.

109
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,650
Boy yeah right yeah right yeah right.

110
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,060
Boy yeah right.

111
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,510
Repetition grabs a hold of our brains in a
way that we often can’t quite control.

112
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,930
And that might feel like the music is playing
us rather than us playing the music.

113
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,260
But if repetition makes songs like Formation,
Lose yourself to Dance, Beat It and I wanna

114
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,270
dance with Somebody both great and memorable.

115
00:06:59,270 --> 00:00:00,000
It can rule the charts forever.
