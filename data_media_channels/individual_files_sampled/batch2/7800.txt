hurricane Irma did hit Florida but luckily it got downgraded to her traveled with storm when it did so of course that doesn't mean that hurricane Irma did not exist it did exist go ask the people in Florida back we're going to show you a video from Florida in a second that's amazing so go ask people in the Caribbean as well so I'm just saying this because there's lunatic right-wingers in our country who don't believe that anything happened unless it personally happened in them now rush limbaugh wouldn't know because he ran for his life so he wasn't there so hurricane Irma death toll in the Caribbean was 39 in the last count and now unfortunately the United States it is 8 now that is of course tragic it could have been far worse if the evacuations had not taken place and if the storm had not gotten downgraded as it approached us not as it made landfall because I think that a lot of people are making the same mistake we always make of this country was empty until we came to it the hurricane you know lost some speed as a made landfall no made landfall in the Caribbean and in a hit the Caribbean incredibly hard by the time it made landfall after landfall after landfall in the Caribbean and got to the to the western part of Florida it had lost speed thank God so but let me tell you the some of the damage that was done it left more than five point eight million people in Florida without power according to the state the I Division of Emergency Management a roughly 83% of Monroe County which includes the Florida Keys and Everglades National Park is in the dark but it was mitigated because nearly seven million people from multiple states the storm's path were told to evacuate their homes according to the Associated Press so let me show you some of the pictures of the damage that was done that's Miami you're gonna see the amazing video in a second of downtown Miami and we'll show you more pictures here as we go along but if we had not evacuated the seven million people I feel the death toll would have been much much higher thank God we took the right precautions and nonetheless eight people died anyway and it was it started as a category five before it hit the islands of the Caribbean if had hit us as a category 5 it would have been far far more devastating luckily like I've been telling you it did get downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it hit us and it is it did not hit the eastern side of Florida as hard as we thought it would II went to the western side but it did hit the keys and the keys sustained a lot more damage now even though it grazed Miami it still did plenty of damage just imagine if it had hit it square at a category 5 this is what a tropical storm basically did when it grazed Miami take a look at this video you can see that the water is basically right on so you're getting a heavy heavy rain over there okay that's videos from yesterday we'll have a link down below to it some good work by a person in one of the high-rises there so look at this of course water all around Miami anyway but you saw there that it has in that case just yesterday it took over the sidewalks and you begun to get a sense of Venice instead of Miami there and and like I said we got real lucky that it didn't hit us when it was a much much stronger storm that's what it looks like when it was a smaller storm and and did a side blow imagine a major blow to Miami and how much it would be underwater that so jos√©'s come and right behind it but but it is also not going to hit Florida so Jose was parked behind that's hurricane Jose but it is also losing power and it has drifted out to the middle of the Atlantic they say now there's a 25% chance that it will hit northern United States 25% chance that hits all the way up in Canada and a 50% chance that it just drifts off into the Atlantic Ocean so what could have been devastating is just really bad right now and and I think we got a little bit lucky there so good news generally speaking obviously tragic for the people who lost loved ones in the in the hurricane and still the great amount of damage that was done to property but after seeing hurricane Harvey after having four hurricanes on the map at the same time believe it or not it could have been worse TYT membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm /join
