1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,038
ESTIMATES OF THE TRENDS ARE 

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:05,705
VERY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, 

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,606
AS ARE THE DEVIATIONS FROM THE 

4
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:06,839
TREND. 

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,246
I WILL SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES. 

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,213
THAT IS THE FIRST SLIDE. 

7
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:15,148
THE FIRST ONE WE ARE LOOKING AT 

8
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:15,915
IS SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM AND 

9
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:21,020
IT IS BASICALLY FOR PARALLEL 

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,788
CONSTRUCTION AND YOU WILL SEE 

11
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,889
EACH SLIDE WILL LOOK A LOT LIKE 

12
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:23,089
THIS. 

13
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,424
THE BLUE PART TO THE LEFT IS 

14
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:28,227
WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE 2012 

15
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:29,229
ELECTION THROUGH THE 2016 

16
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,464
ELECTION. 

17
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:35,435
THE DOTTED BLUE LINE IS THE 

18
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,271
TREND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

19
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:38,871
INHERITED FROM THE PREVIOUS 

20
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:39,906
PRESIDENT AND THE RED LINE IS 

21
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,073
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO THE 

22
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:43,076
DATA. 

23
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,578
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART, YOU 

24
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,813
CAN SEE THE FIRST THING IS 

25
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,381
SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM AND THE 

26
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,151
MIDDLE CHART IS THAT NOW IT'S A 

27
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,185
GOOD TIME TO EXPAND ON THE LAST 

28
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,386
ONE IS THE PERCENT EXPECTING 

29
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,822
HIGHER SALES IN SIX MONTHS. 

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,223
IF YOU LOOK AT ANY OF THOSE, 

31
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:00,560
YOU WOULD SAY THAT DOESN'T 

32
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,194
REALLY LOOK LIKE CONTINUATION 

33
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:01,794
OF A RECENT TREND. 

34
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:02,228
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. 

35
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:08,435
THE NEXT CHART IS SOMETHING THAT

36
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,937
IN MY FIRST OPPRESSOR WAY BACK 

37
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,772
LAST FALL, WE TALKED A LOT 

38
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,005
ABOUT. 

39
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,006
IT'S BUSINESS INVESTMENT, MORE 

40
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,209
THAN $300 BILLION OVER THE 

41
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,477
TREND. 

42
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,046
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLUE LINE ON 

43
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,115
THE LEFT, THE FIRST CHART IS 

44
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:22,782
NONRESIDENTIAL FIXED INVESTMENT 

45
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:23,917
AND THE DOTTED LINE IS THE 

46
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,584
TREND IN THE GROWTH RATE 

47
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,254
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP INHERITED

48
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,622
IN THE MIDDLE CHART IS 

49
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,424
STRUCTURES OR BUILDINGS IN THAT,

50
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,594
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE DOTTED LINE 

51
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,563
IS HEADED STRAIGHTDOWN IN THE 

52
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,263
FINAL CHART IS EQUIPMENT 

53
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:37,897
INVESTMENT AND THAT WENT 

54
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,564
STRAIGHT DOWN BEFORE PRESIDENT 

55
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:43,336
DONALD TRUMP WAS SELECTED. 

56
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,938
ANYONE WOULD ASSERT THAT THE 

57
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,139
CAPITAL SPENDING BOOM THAT WE 

58
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,508
ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW WAS A 

59
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,609
CONTINUATION OF THE TREND THAT 

60
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,544
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

61
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,945
INHERITED, THEN, THEY WOULDN'T 

62
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:53,946
GET A HIGH GRADE IN GRADUATE 

63
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:54,680
SCHOOL FOR THAT ASSERTION. 

64
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:11,965
THE NEXT CHART, PLEASE. 

65
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,665
DURABLE GOODS ORDERS AND 

66
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,499
CAPITAL GOODS ORDERS, A KEY 

67
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,867
PART OF THE ECONOMY AND ONE OF 

68
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,902
THE FACTORS WE LOOK AT MOST 

69
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:16,569
LOOK CLOSELY BECAUSE IT 

70
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,170
CHARACTERIZES, BASICALLY, THE 

71
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,937
GOOD PAYING JOBS, THE JOBS THAT 

72
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:18,604
AFFECT NORMAL AMERICANS, BLUE-

73
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:19,472
COLLAR AMERICANS IN THE FIRST 

74
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,072
CHART IS CORE CAPITAL GOODS 

75
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:21,941
ORDERS AND THE SECOND IS CORE 

76
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,474
CAPITAL GOODS SHIPMENTS. 

77
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,376
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, THE BLUE 

78
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,043
SHOWS A CLEAR DOWNWARD 

79
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,044
TRAJECTORY AND BILLIONS OF 

80
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,646
DOLLARS AND THE TRAJECTORY 

81
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:28,314
REVERSED ITSELF COMPLETELY WHEN 

82
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,248
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS 

83
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,586
ELECTED. 

84
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,556
IF YOU ASSERT THE CURRENT GOOD 

85
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,058
NEWS IS THE EXTENSION OF THE 

86
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,927
RECENT TREND, THEN YOU WOULD 

87
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,061
SIMPLY BE FACTUALLY INCORRECT. 

88
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,863
THE NEXT CHART SLIDE, PLEASE. 

89
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:44,964
HERE, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE IS 

90
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:45,631
AND PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX, 

91
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:50,937
A SURVEY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 

92
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:51,871
PURCHASING MANAGERS FOR 

93
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:59,011
MANUFACTURING FIRMS AND IS THE 

94
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,580
TITLE SUGGESTS, MANAGES 

95
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,147
PURCHASES. 

96
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,315
IT'S A GREAT INDICATOR OF THE 

97
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,750
ECONOMY BECAUSE YOU CAN SURVEY 

98
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,119
THEM AND SAY, HAVE YOU BEEN 

99
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,554
BUYING LOTS OF STUFF THIS MONTH 

100
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,289
OR HAVE YOU NOT? 

101
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,890
THE INDEX SHOWS WHAT THE 

102
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,326
RESPONSES LOOK LIKE AND YOU CAN 

103
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,862
SEE THE TREND ON THE PURCHASING 

104
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,629
MANAGERS INDEX WAS PRETTY MUCH 

105
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,397
FLAT WHEN PRESIDENT DONALD 

106
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,231
TRUMP TOOK OFFIE AND THE RED 

107
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,331
LINE SHOWS WHAT HAPPENED SINCE. 

108
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,633
THERE IS A CLEAR INFLECTION AT 

109
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:28,007
THE ELECTION AND A CLEAR BREAK 

110
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:28,274
IN TREND. 

111
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,008
LET'S TURN TO THE NEXT ONE. 

112
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,545
NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN 

113
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:37,416
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT BEFORE I 

114
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,018
CAME, WAS THE FACT THAT 

115
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,353
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN AMERICA WAS 

116
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,587
FALLING OFF AND ONE OF THE WAYS 

117
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:42,255
WE CAN MEASURE 

118
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:42,955
ENTREPRENEURSHIP, IF YOU START 

119
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,257
A NEW BUSINESS, YOU HAVE TO 

120
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:49,729
APPLY FOR AN I.D. 

121
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,564
NUMBER, A TAX I.D. 

122
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,498
NUMBER FOR YOUR BUSINESS. 

123
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,534
IN THIS CHART WE PLOTTED THE 

124
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,968
EIN APPLICATIONS FOR NEW 

125
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:58,738
BUSINESSES AND IF YOU LOOK AT 

126
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,907
THE BLUE LINE, THEY WERE HEADING

127
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,607
UP AT THE RECOVERY. 

128
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,375
BUT, THERE IS CLEAR UPWARD 

129
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,109
TRAJECTORY, WAY ABOVE THE TREND 

130
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:10,083
AT THE END AND SARAH, LIKE JOHN 

131
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,318
ROBERTS, IS A CALCULUS GEEK SHE 

132
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,353
LOOKED AT THAT ONE AND SAID IT 

133
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,688
LOOKS LIKE A VERY STRONG SECOND 

134
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,990
DERIVATIVE TO ME AND I SAID, I 

135
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,791
DIDN'T KNOW YOU DID CALCULUS 

136
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,726
AND SHE SAID I LIKE CALCULUS 

137
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,262
BETTER THAN TALKING TO THESE 

138
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:22,462
GUYS. 

139
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,064
[ LAUGHTER ] THIS CHART IS 

140
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,366
WORKERS REENTERING THE LABOR 

141
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,201
FORCE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

142
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,968
TREND, ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE 

143
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,238
SAID WILL REPORT ALL THE GROWTH 

144
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,740
FORECAST IS WE WOULD HAVE 3% 

145
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,141
GROWTH AND WE SAID PRESIDENT 

146
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,808
DONALD TRUMP'S POLICIES WOULD 

147
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:36,809
BRING FACTORIES BACK TO THE 

148
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,280
U.S. AND GIVE CAPITAL SPENDING 

149
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,349
BOOM FROM THE CHART AND IT WOULD

150
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,585
BRING PEOPLE BACK TO THE LABOR 

151
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,588
FORCE AT PRECISELY THE RIGHT 

152
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:48,788
TIME. 

153
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,291
ONCE AGAIN, YOU CAN SEE A CLEAR 

154
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:51,758
BREAK IN THE TREND. 

155
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:56,429
IF YOU SEE A BREAK IN THE TREND 

156
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,697
IN THE CAPITAL SPENDING, THE 

157
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,899
NEW PLANT FORMATION THAT GIVES 

158
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,000
BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS THEIR JOBS, 

159
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,703
THEN, WE MAY SEE A BREAK IN THE 

160
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,838
TREND IN BLUE COLOR'S WORKERS 

161
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,472
EMPLOYMENT, AS WELL. 

162
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,272
THIS IS EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE 

163
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,574
AND GOODS PRODUCING INDUSTRIES. 

164
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,610
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLUE LINE ON 

165
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,881
THE LEFT, THERE IS A CLEAR 

166
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,916
DOWNWARD TREND IN THE GROWTH 

167
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,116
RATE OF THAT FOR PRESIDENT 

168
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:19,118
OBAMA AND A CLEAR INFLECTION 

169
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:19,952
TIME TO ALMOST PRECISELY, ONCE 

170
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,552
AGAIN, THE ELECTION AND THE 

171
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:27,460
NOTION THAT SOMEONE OF THE 

172
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,561
TREND, IT IS ALMOST LAUGHABLE 

173
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,596
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART AND 

174
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,298
THEN LOOK AT THE REST OF THEM. 

175
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,267
SOMEBODY MIGHT SAY IF YOU ARE 

176
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,535
SHOWING A BUNCH OF CHARTS, 

177
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,303
DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU ESTIMATE 

178
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,472
THE TREND AND I'M SURE IF YOU 

179
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,707
WENT BACK AND BEGAN YOUR 

180
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:42,775
ESTIMATE OF THE CIVIL WAR AND 

181
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,376
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT TREND WE 

182
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,245
WOULD GET, MAYBE WE WOULD GET A 

183
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:46,912
DIFFERENT ANSWER FROM WHAT WE'D 

184
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:47,112
SEE. 

185
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,682
ANOTHER WAY TO TEST WHETHER THE 

186
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,750
DATA I SHOWED YOU IS A FAIR 

187
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,951
REPRESENTATION OF WHAT A TREND 

188
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:57,557
LOOKS LIKE FROM WHEN PRESIDENT 

189
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,059
DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED, IS TO 

190
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:00,959
COMPARE IT TO NON-PARTISAN 

191
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,994
BODIES, SUCH AS MY FINAL CHART. 

192
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,095
I HEARD A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN I 

193
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:06,899
SAID FINAL CHART. 

194
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,134
SO, IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINAL 

195
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,435
CHART, YOU'LL SEE THAT THE 

196
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,972
BLACK LINE IS IN JUNE 2017, 

197
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:18,678
WHAT THE CBO CONGRESSIONAL 

198
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,745
BUDGET OFFICE HAS A JOB OF 

199
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,047
LOOKING AT RECENT TRENDS AND 

200
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,416
PROJECTING IT. 

201
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,282
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO CAPITAL 

202
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:25,484
SPENDING, AND 2017, THE BLUE 

203
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,987
LINE IS WHAT THEY SAID IN APRIL 

204
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:32,458
2018 AND THE RED LINE IS WHAT 

205
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,827
ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 

206
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,896
I WOULD ASSERT THAT IF YOU LOOK 

207
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,431
AT THE COLLECTIVE BODY OF 

208
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,265
EVIDENCE, THE NOTION THAT WHAT 

209
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,266
WE SEE RIGHT NOW IS A 

210
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:40,900
CONTINUATION OF RECENT TRENDS 

211
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,468
IS NOT SUPER DEFENSIBLE AND I 

212
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,973
THINK THAT WE ARE IN A 

213
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,241
POLITICAL TIME AND PASSIONS ARE 

214
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:54,113
HIGH BUT AS KEY ECONOMISTS, ONE 

215
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,381
OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS 

216
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,883
THINK ABOUT WHAT HISTORIANS 

217
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,317
WILL THINK WHEN THEY LOOK AT 

218
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,318
THIS TIME AND I PROMISE YOU 

219
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,052
ECONOMIC HISTORIANS WILL 100% 

220
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,521
EXCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS 

221
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,320
AN INFLECTION AT THE ELECTION 

222
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,927
OF DONALD TRUMP AND A WHOLE 

223
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,762
BUNCH OF DATA ITEMS STARTED 

224
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,030
HEADING NORTH AND THEY WILL, OF 

225
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,567
COURSE, ARGUE FOR A LONG TIME 

226
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,767
ABOUT WHY THAT HAPPENED. 

227
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,371
BUT MY FINAL THOUGHT IS THIS, 

228
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,273
WHEN THEY DO THAT, AND WHEN YOU 

229
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,575
WATCH PEOPLE DO THAT IN THE 

230
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,409
MEDIA GOING FORWARD WITH OP-EDS 

231
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,878
AND SO ON, YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT 

232
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,645
FOR EX POST THEORIZING. 

233
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:27,613
AS AN ECONOMIST, ONE OF THE 

234
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,183
THINGS I CARE ABOUT IS IF 

235
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,319
SOMETHING HAPPENS BEFORE, YOU 

236
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,753
WATCH THE DATA TO SEE IF IT 

237
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:34,987
AGREES. 

238
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,055
THAT'S HOW YOU TEST A THEORY. 

239
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,723
YOU MIGHT RECALL I CAN BACK 

240
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,691
YOUR LAST FALL AND TOLD YOU 

241
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,094
THAT IF WE HAD THE TAX CUTS, 

242
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,463
THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

243
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,997
ADVISE THAT WE HAVE, THAT HE 

244
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,166
PURSUED, IF WE PASS THEM THERE 

245
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,236
WOULD HE BE A BOOM IN CAPITAL 

246
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,237
SPENDING THIS YEAR. 

247
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,140
IN FACT, WE PROVIDED ESTIMATES 

248
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,840
LAST FALL THAT SAID CAPITAL 

249
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,075
SPENDING THIS YEAR WE GO UP 

250
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,209
ABOUT 11% BECAUSE OF THE TAX 

251
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,746
CUTS. SO FAR, AND THE FIRST 

252
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,081
HALF OF THE YEAR, CAPITAL 

253
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,051
SPENDING IS UP 10%. 

254
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,652
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACH FAR FOR 

255
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,787
A THEORY OF WHAT HAPPENED. 

256
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,621
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

257
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,755
DEREGULATED THE ECONOMY AND WE 

258
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,790
TALKED ABOUT THE GROWTH AND THE 

259
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,190
TAX CUTS HAVE HAD THE PREDICTED 

260
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,930
EFFECT TO BRING BUSINESSES AND 

261
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,665
FACTORIES BACK TO THE U.S. AND 

262
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,766
JOBS WERE CREATED FOR ORDINARY 

263
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,067
AMERICANS. 

264
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,502
IT'S CLEAR THERE HAS BEEN A 

265
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,537
TREND BREAK AND WITH THAT, I 

266
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,739
LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING A FEW 

267
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,307
QUESTIONS BEFORE A HANDED OFF 

268
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,542
TO SARAH TO TALK ABOUT OTHER 

269
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:29,775
THINGS. 

270
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,077
I WILL LET MR. ROBERTS GO 

271
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:31,544
FIRST. 

272
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,511
I KNOW I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GO 

273
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,145
FOR THE WHOLE TIME. 

274
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,580
>> BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU 

275
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,419
GAVE US, WHERE IS THE REVENUE 

276
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,722
DERIVED FROM THESE INCREASING 

277
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,890
TRENDS MEETING THE DEFICIT LINE 

278
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,690
CAUSED BY TAXES? 

279
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,492
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. 

280
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,662
ONE OF THE THINGS WE COULD TALK 

281
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,397
ABOUT -- SARAH, LET'S HAVE 

282
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,098
ANOTHER BRIEFING AFTER THE 

283
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:52,531
CALCULUS BRIEFING. 

284
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,165
LET'S DO A BRIEFING ON THE 

285
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:53,432
DEFICIT. 

286
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:59,138
ONE OF THE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT 

287
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,106
THIS, THERE HAS BEEN A BIG 

288
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,340
CHANGE IN TAX LAW AND A BIG 

289
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,846
CHANGE IN SPENDING POLICY. 

290
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,148
ON THE TAX LAW SIDE, YOU 

291
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,317
REMEMBER THE DYNAMICS SCORE FOR 

292
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,153
THE CORPORATE TAX WAS THAT IT 

293
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,555
WOULD HAVE A VERY, VERY LOW 

294
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,190
COST AND I THINK THE COST 

295
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,991
ESTIMATE, NOT DYNAMICALLY 

296
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:23,996
SCORED AND PROBABLY NOT, ABOUT 

297
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,997
$400 BILLION IN THE FINAL BILL 

298
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,965
OVER 10 YEARS AND CLEARLY THE 

299
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:26,599
GROWTH AND INVESTMENT BOOM 

300
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,704
PROJECTED BY CBO WAS A 

301
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,839
SIGNIFICANT UNDER ESTIMATE FOR 

302
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,339
WHAT HAPPENED ALREADY. 

303
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,142
THE NOTION THAT THE CORPORATE 

304
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,310
TAX SIDE HAS PAID FOR ITSELF IS 

305
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,411
CLEARLY IN THE DATA. 

306
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,982
ON THE INDIVIDUAL SIDE, ABOUT A 

307
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,283
$1 TRILLION COST AND $700 

308
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,551
BILLION WITH A REFUNDABLE CHILD 

309
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,287
CREDIT THAT GOT EXPANDED AT THE 

310
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,156
LAST MINUTE TO GET THE VOTES 

311
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:50,789
THEY NEEDED TO PASS IT. 

312
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,258
A REFUNDABLE CHILD CREDIT IS A 

313
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,994
VERY SOUND POLICY FOR PEOPLE 

314
00:09:55,994 --> 00:09:57,063
WHO CARE ABOUT EQUALITY OF 

315
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:57,663
OPPORTUNITY OR FAMILIES WITH 

316
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,432
CHILDREN AND PRESIDENT DONALD 

317
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,635
TRUMP SUPPORTED HEART -- 

318
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,004
SUPPORTED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND 

319
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,305
THE CHILD CREDIT IS NOT 

320
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,207
SOMETHING THAT WOULD EXPECT TO 

321
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:08,607
PAY FOR ITSELF. 

322
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,943
THE TAX CUTS HAVE INCREASED THE 

323
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,712
DEFICIT A LITTLE BIT, BUT NOT 

324
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,913
THE TAX CUTS THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

325
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,114
ATTACKING, BUT RATHER THAT THEY 

326
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,382
SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED. 

327
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,550
I WILL GO TO ROAD TRIP TO. 

328
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,553
I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW YOUR 

329
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,189
NAME. 

330
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,423
>> THERE'S ANOTHER THING, THE 

331
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,224
SPIKE IN CONSUMER PRICING, THE 

332
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:29,528
COST OF GOODS, THE INFLATION. 

333
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:29,961
THE HIGHER RATE. 

334
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:31,062
AMERICANS ARE PAYING MORE FOR 

335
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:37,803
GOODS THAN THEY DID IN RECENT 

336
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,036
YEARS. 

337
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,072
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO WHAT EXTENT 

338
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,239
AMERICANS SHOULD BE CONCERNED 

339
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,508
ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOODS 

340
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,110
INCREASING AT A HIGH RATE? 

341
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,311
>> WELL, AMERICANS SHOULD BE 

342
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,211
CONCERNED THAT PRICES ARE GOING 

343
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,413
UP AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

344
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,484
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OVER THE 

345
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,418
MOST RECENT YEAR, IT'S A LITTLE 

346
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,287
BIT SHORT OF 3% AND I KNOW THAT 

347
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,522
IS SOMETHING THAT WILL AFFECT 

348
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,591
AMERICANS WHEN THEY GO TO THE 

349
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,859
GROCERY STORE OR THE GAS 

350
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,060
STATION AND THEY CAN AND SHOULD 

351
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,195
BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. 

352
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,564
THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST THE 

353
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,000
INCREASE IN INFLATION IS AN 

354
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,802
INCREASE IN WAGES AND THE CEA 

355
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,404
PUT OUT A NICE REPORT THAT IT 

356
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,504
CORRECTLY MEASURED REAL AFTER-

357
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:13,272
TAX WAGES GROWING ABOUT 1.4% 

358
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,673
THIS YEAR AND THE WAGE GROWTH 

359
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,110
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HELPED 

360
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,911
CREATE WITH HIS POLICIES IS 

361
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,511
OVERPOWERING THE INFLATION 

362
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,880
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW. 

363
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,581
I WILL GO TO ROW THREE AND THEN 

364
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:27,119
BACK. 

365
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,389
>> WHAT CREDIT, IF ANY, DOES 

366
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,557
PRESIDENT OBAMA DESERVE FOR THE 

367
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,160
CURRENT STATE OF THE ECONOMY? 

368
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,427
>> ATTRIBUTING BLAME OR CREDIT 

369
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,096
TO INDIVIDUALS REQUIRES THAT I 

370
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,564
IDENTIFY POLICIES AND TALK 

371
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,533
ABOUT WHAT EFFECT THIS POLICY 

372
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,834
OR THAT POLICY HAS AND I PREFER 

373
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,868
TO GIVE BLAME OR CREDIT TO 

374
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,736
POLICIES RATHER THAN 

375
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,540
INDIVIDUALS. 

376
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,440
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SOMETIMES ON 

377
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,007
THE PARTISAN TRAIL, GETS 

378
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:50,075
CRITICIZED WITH NUMBERS THAT 

379
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:54,346
ARE CLEARLY INCORRECT BECAUSE 

380
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,449
PEOPLE BLAME HIM FOR THE GREAT 

381
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,483
RECESSION THAT ALREADY STARTED 

382
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:57,950
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR. 

383
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,087
UP I LOOK AT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 

384
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:02,855
POLICIES, THERE ARE A BUNCH 

385
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,655
THAT WERE NEGATIVE FOR GROWTH. 

386
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:04,457
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LIFTED 

387
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:08,159
MARGINAL TAX RATES SO MUCH SO 

388
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,563
THAT THE CBO EVEN SAID IT WOULD 

389
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,997
HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON 

390
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:12,530
GROWTH AND HE INCREASED 

391
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,466
MARGINAL TAX RATES ON SMALL 

392
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,133
BUSINESSES AND THAT'S WHY SMALL 

393
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:18,503
BUSINESS CREATION WASN'T SO 

394
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:19,305
HIGH. 

395
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,608
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THESE ONE BY 

396
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,843
ONE AND SAY THEY MAY HELP OR 

397
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,176
HURT GROWTH. 

398
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:24,844
HE ADVOCATED POLICIES THAT 

399
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:29,281
CLEARLY DID NOT AND I WONDER 

400
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,649
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE HEADS 

401
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,484
OF THE ECONOMISTS THAT TOLD 

402
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,250
THEM THEY WOULD, THEY DIDN'T 

403
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,055
HAVE MUCH EFFECT BUT TO SAY HE 

404
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:36,756
DESTROYED THE ECONOMY OR 

405
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,990
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THAT IS 

406
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,328
NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. 

407
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,231
>> HIGH OF TWO QUESTIONS. 

408
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,465
CAN I TAKE THEM SEPARATELY? 

409
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:46,899
>> JUST OF THIS 

410
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,466
>> GO SEPARATELY. 

411
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:52,204
I WILL FORGET THE FIRST ONE. 

412
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,539
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 

413
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,108
ECONOMIC NUMBERS IN THE FIRST 

414
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,343
WEEK IN NEARLY THREE WEEKS AND 

415
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,178
IT SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE TIMED 

416
00:12:59,178 --> 00:12:59,979
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECHES 

417
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,714
IN WHICH HE TALKED ABOUT THE 

418
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,582
ECONOMY AND THESE ISSUES. 

419
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,883
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY? 

420
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:06,919
>> THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT, 

421
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,186
ACTUALLY. 

422
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,087
'S CAN TELL YOU I'VE BEEN 

423
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:11,190
PUSHING HER TO LET ME SHOW THESE

424
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,192
SLIDES FOR QUITE A WHILE AND 

425
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,627
WE'VE UPDATED THEM FOR RECENT 

426
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:14,827
DATA. 

427
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,562
IN FACT, I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT 

428
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,128
THE THREE-WEEK LEG. 

429
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:19,765
I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO 

430
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,233
WITH THE FACT THAT SENSIBLE 

431
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,237
PEOPLE EVEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

432
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,238
TAKE A BREAK IN AUGUST AND 

433
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,239
THERE ARE SOME VACATION 

434
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:27,506
TAKINGS. 

435
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,674
WE WERE PREPARED TO DO THIS 

436
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:33,145
BRIEFING AND IT'S NOT IN ANY 

437
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,013
WAY A TIMING RELATED TO 

438
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:34,580
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FRIDAY 

439
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:34,847
REMARKS. 

440
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,384
AND I PROMISE TO NUMBER TWO. 

441
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,551
THE NEXT PERSON WILL ASK THREE, 

442
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:39,884
YOU REALIZE. 

443
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:43,655
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. 

444
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,292
>> THE PRESIDENT -- I'M CURIOUS 

445
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,460
ABOUT YOUR VIEWS -- HE HAS TOLD 

446
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,162
PRIVATE COMPANIES, APPLE AND 

447
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,364
AMAZON AND THE NFL HOW TO RUN 

448
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,364
THEIR BUSINESS. 

449
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,700
DO BELIEVE THAT'S APPROPRIATE 

450
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,402
AND STIMULATES ECONOMIC GROWTH 

451
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,503
FOR PRESIDENT TO BE DICTATING 

452
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,604
HOW PRIVATE COMPANIES RUN THEIR 

453
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:58,938
STUFF? 

454
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,339
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS STRONG 

455
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,106
OPNIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND 

456
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,575
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE 

457
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,444
POLICY'S SUCCESS WE'VE HAD IF 

458
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,512
HE HADN'T BEEN SUCH A STRONG 

459
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,346
ADVOCATE FOR THE THINGS WE'VE 

460
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:07,980
SEEN. 

461
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,614
HIS STRONG OPINIONS SOMETIMES 

462
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,882
STRETCH INTO AREAS THAT ARE 

463
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:16,388
OUTSIDE PLACES THAT THERE IS A 

464
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,456
PURVIEW AND I DON'T COUNSEL HIM 

465
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:17,722
ON THAT. 

466
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,091
AT A PREVIOUS PRESS RIGHT ONE 

467
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,529
SAID I DON'T RUN THE COUNCIL OF 

468
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,363
TWITTER ADVISORS AND THAT COULD 

469
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,597
BE TRUE FOR ALL OF MY STAY 

470
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:25,797
HERE. 

471
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:26,999
I WILL GO BACK TO THE BLUE 

472
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,669
SHIRT AND THE BACK. 

473
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,303
I SKIPPED A ROW. 

474
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:35,541
>> A QUICK QUESTION ON THE 

475
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,442
ECONOMIC STAFF. THE PRESIDENT 

476
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,309
SAID THE GDP RATE IS HIGHER 

477
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,711
THAN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR 

478
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:43,415
THE FIRST TIME IN OVER 100 

479
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:43,749
YEARS. 

480
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,316
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE, IS IT? 

481
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:46,618
>> I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IS TRUE. 

482
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:47,686
THE HISTORY OF THOUGHT [ 

483
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:51,890
LAUGHTER ] LET ME SAY THE 

484
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,758
HISTORY OF THOUGHT OF HOW 

485
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,462
ERRORS HAPPEN IS NOT SOMETHING 

486
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,295
THAT I CAN ENGAGE IN BECAUSE 

487
00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:03,435
FROM THE INITIAL FACT TO WHAT 

488
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,569
THE PRESIDENT SAID, THAT I 

489
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,605
DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE CHAIN OF 

490
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,141
COMMAND, BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS IT 

491
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,211
IS THE HIGHEST IN 10 YEARS AND 

492
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,011
AT SOME POINT, SOMEBODY 

493
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:13,846
PROBABLY CONVEYED IT TO HIM, 

494
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:14,813
ADDING A ZERO AND THEY 

495
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,346
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. 

496
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:16,448
AT LEAST THE NUMBERS AT THE 

497
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:22,755
WHITE HOUSE -- WHEN THE PRESS 

498
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,023
FINDS MISTAKES, WE DON'T LIKE 

499
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,824
MAKING THEM BUT WE ARE GRATEFUL 

500
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,393
TO HAVE THEM POINTED OUT 

501
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,126
BECAUSE WE WANT TO CORRECT 

502
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:28,327
THEM. 

503
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,161
YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED I GAVE 

504
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,295
SARAH BAD NUMBER AND IT WAS MY 

505
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:34,833
FAULT AND WE APOLOGIZED. 

506
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,068
YOU'D HAVE TO TALK TO THE 

507
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:36,601
PRESIDENT ABOUT WHERE THE 

508
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:37,436
NUMBER CAME FROM BUT THE 

509
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:43,142
CORRECT NUMBER IS 10 YEARS. 

510
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:43,976
>> FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID 

511
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:44,743
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WOULD 

512
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:50,516
NEED A MAGIC WAND TO GET TO 4% 

513
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,316
GDP AND THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED 

514
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,184
THAT WAS A DIRECT QUOTE. 

515
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,251
DID PRESIDENT OBAMA EVER SAY 

516
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:56,922
THAT? 

517
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,824
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

518
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,792
I'M NOT THE CHAIRMAN OF COUNCIL 

519
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:01,259
OF TWITTER ADVISORS. 

520
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,294
>> THE WHITE HOUSE PUT OUT A 

521
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,729
NUMBER THAT USES A DIFFERENT 

522
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,565
WAY OF CALCULATING GROWTH. 

523
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,399
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS 

524
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:07,966
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE YOU GET 

525
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,402
APPLES AND ORANGES COMPARISONS. 

526
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,037
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO DO THAT 

527
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,373
WITH NEW CALCULATIONS THAT WERE 

528
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,043
NOT CASH BENEFITS LIKE VACATION 

529
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,144
TIMES AND OTHER TYPES OF 

530
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:29,154
BENEFITS. 

531
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,155
WHY IS THAT MIDSTREAM AND YOU 

532
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:30,856
DON'T BASE YOUR ANALYSIS ON 

533
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,523
THAT FROM THE PAST? 

534
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,323
>> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. 

535
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:33,391
WE HAVE A REPORT THAT CAME OUT 

536
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,560
LAST WEEK AND THERE WERE A LOT 

537
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,460
OF STORIES THAT I THOUGHT WERE 

538
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,663
WELL DONE AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT 

539
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:37,963
THE PEACE. 

540
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,364
THE QUESTION FOR AMERICANS AND 

541
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,267
WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW, HOW ARE 

542
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:42,934
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 

543
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,002
POLICIES AFFECTING THEIR LIVES? 

544
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:46,672
IT TURNS OUT THE STATISTIC THAT 

545
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,706
GOT THE MOST ATTENTION IN THE 

546
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,507
MEDIA IS NOT VERY REASONABLE 

547
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,775
FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION AND 

548
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:54,546
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO BETTER 

549
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:54,879
MEASURE THAT. 

550
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,315
IT WAS NOT A CRITICISM OF THE 

551
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:56,982
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. 

552
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,150
WE LOVE THAT AND WE ARE DATA 

553
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,185
GEEKS AND WE WANT TO COME UP TO 

554
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,554
A BETTER MEASURE TO ACCOUNT FOR 

555
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,555
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE GET 

556
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,190
BENEFITS AND IT WOULD ACCOUNT 

557
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,625
FOR THE FACT THAT PEOPLE JUST 

558
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,560
HEAD TAX CUTS AND A BETTER 

559
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
MEASURE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE 

560
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,329
FACT THAT THE COMPOSITION OF 

561
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,829
THE LABOR FORCE IS CHANGING 

562
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,432
BECAUSE SO MANY ARE COMING IN 

563
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,400
AND THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN 

564
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,536
OUT FOR WHILE TEND TO BE LOWER 

565
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,368
SKILLED AND BRING DOWN AVERAGES 

566
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,537
IF YOU DON'T CONTROL FOR THAT. 

567
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:24,510
WE SHOW THAT JUST AS IS 

568
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,579
CONSISTENT WITH THE 4.2 GDT -- 

569
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,150
4.2% GDP GROWTH, THERE IS A 

570
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,084
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GROWTH 

571
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:32,651
COMPARED TO THE PROJECTIONS 

572
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,352
WHEN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

573
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:33,685
TOOK OFFICE. 

574
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,686
I DON'T SEE SARAH TELLING ME TO 

575
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:34,886
STOP. 

576
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:39,925
SHOULD I KEEP GOING? 

577
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:40,959
I'VE BEEN RIGHT HANDED AND I 

578
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,259
APOLOGIZE. 

579
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,861
>> HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR YOU 

580
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,798
TO HAVE A NEW NORTH AMERICAN 

581
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,636
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT INCLUDING 

582
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:51,870
CHINA? 

583
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,205
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION 

584
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,107
AND THE FIRST THING BEFORE I 

585
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,010
TURN TO THE TRADE PART OF THE 

586
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,411
QUESTION IS THAT SOME PEOPLE 

587
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,946
HAVE SAID THE ECONOMY IS 

588
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,915
STRONG, BUT THAT IS A SUGAR 

589
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,682
HIGH. 

590
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,950
IT'S NOT A SUGAR HIGH BECAUSE 

591
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,385
THE CAPITAL SPENDING BUT WE 

592
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,020
PROMISE THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE 

593
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,354
PASSED THE TAX CUTS IS UNDER 

594
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:09,755
WAY. 

595
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,190
THE COOL THING ABOUT CAPITAL 

596
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,890
SPENDING IS THAT PEOPLE BUILD 

597
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,824
FACTORIES AND THAT IS WHAT 

598
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,626
CAPITAL SPENDING IS AND THEY DO 

599
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,894
IT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 

600
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:17,563
YEAR. 

601
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,132
IT'S UP 10% AND THE SECOND 

602
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:20,966
HALF, THE FACTORIES PRODUCE 

603
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,400
OUTPU AND YOU GET MORE OUTPUT. 

604
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,203
THE IDEA THAT THE TREND MIGHT 

605
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,705
NOT CONTINUE AND IT IS A SUGAR 

606
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,974
HIGH IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE 

607
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,309
FORM THE GROWTH IS TAKING. 

608
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,377
FOR NAFTA, THE TEAM HAS BEEN IN 

609
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,612
NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA AND 

610
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,681
MAY CONTINUE TO BE HOPEFUL THEY 

611
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,983
WILL SIGN ON TO THE 21ST 

612
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,052
CENTURY DEAL WITH MEXICO, A 

613
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:40,585
BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICAN 

614
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:41,620
WORKERS AND THEY SHOULD SIGN ON 

615
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:41,887
TO THAT. 

616
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,188
I WILL GO BACK TO YOU. 

617
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:50,561
>> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE 

618
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,131
INCREMENT INEQUALITY. 

619
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,432
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE INCOME 

620
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,967
INEQUALITY STREAM AND ARE YOU 

621
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,600
CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER PEOPLE 

622
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,701
WHO ARE POOR, NOT PEOPLE IN THE 

623
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:01,106
COUNTY, BUT PEOPLE BEYOND THE 

624
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:01,840
POVERTY LINE, ARE THEY BEING 

625
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,711
HELPED BY THE ECONOMY? 

626
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:08,847
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE 

627
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,549
NEW ENTRANTS THAT GET A JOB, 

628
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,950
THEY GO FROM HAVING ZERO WAGE 

629
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,118
TO HAVING A WAGE BUT THEY WON'T 

630
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,219
NECESSARILY SHOW UP IN THE WAGE 

631
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,353
STATISTICS AND THEY ARE BETTER 

632
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:30,269
OFF. 

633
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,036
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THEY ARE 

634
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,037
BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF THE 

635
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:32,738
GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY AND 

636
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,605
POLICIES THAT HAVE GIVEN 

637
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,373
RESOURCES TO FAMILIES THAT ARE 

638
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:34,673
KNEE-DEEP. 

639
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,741
AT THE CDA, WE PUT OUT A 

640
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,408
DIFFERENT REPORT ON WHAT IS 

641
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,309
GOING ON WITH PROPERTY 

642
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:37,742
CORRECTLY MEASURED. 

643
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:39,011
THERE IS IMPORTANT DATA COMING 

644
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,546
OUT THIS WEEK THAT WILL HELP 

645
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:42,848
LOOK HOW INCOME INEQUALITY HAS 

646
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,049
CHANGED THIS YEAR AND OVER THE 

647
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:44,416
PREVIOUS YEAR. 

648
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,252
MY EXPECTATION IS THAT THE DATA 

649
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,755
WILL START TO TURN AND THIS 

650
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,989
YEAR WE WILL SEE A DECLINE IN 

651
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:51,856
INCOME INEQUALITY BECAUSE BLUE-

652
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,759
COLLAR WAGES ARE STARTING TO 

653
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,192
GROW. 

654
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,193
IT IS A FINAL POINT AND 

655
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:55,894
IMPORTANT THAT YOU BRING THIS 

656
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,863
UP AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT 

657
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,398
BECAUSE I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT 

658
00:19:59,398 --> 00:19:59,565
IT. 

659
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,967
THE FACT IS, WE ARE AT A 

660
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,136
HISTORIC MOMENT BECAUSE WE ARE 

661
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,336
DEEP INTO A RECOVERY. 

662
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:06,805
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS REALLY 

663
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,441
LOW AND WE'VE CREATED A CAPITAL 

664
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:09,908
SPENDING BOOM. 

665
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,877
NORMALLY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A 

666
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,511
CAPITAL SPENDING BOOM, PEOPLE 

667
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,314
START TO BID UP THE WAGES, BUT 

668
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,948
THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THERE 

669
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,950
IS A SHORTAGE OF LABOR. 

670
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,552
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW, THEY ARE 

671
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,353
BIDDING UP WAGES BECAUSE PEOPLE 

672
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,455
HAVE BETTER MACHINES TO WORK 

673
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,723
WITH AND THEIR PRODUCTIVITY IS 

674
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,558
GOING UP AND THAT MEANS THE 

675
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,460
RECOVERY CAN LAST LONGER AND 

676
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,828
THAT IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD FOR 

677
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,730
WORKERS AT THE LOW-END. 

678
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,765
AT THIS MOMENT IN ECONOMIC 

679
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,200
HISTORY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

680
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,002
PAST ECONOMIC BOOMS, INCOME 

681
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:37,402
EQUALITY DECLINE. 

682
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,540
IF WE WERE TO BLOW IT AND HAVE A

683
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,507
RECESSION BECAUSE OF BAD 

684
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,242
POLICY, WE WOULD LOSE AN 

685
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,242
ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY ON INCOME 

686
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,878
INEQUALITY. 

687
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:47,645
IT'S THE LAST QUESTION. 

688
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:29,221
>>> THE ACTIVITY'S FORWARD-

689
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:29,487
LOOKING. 

690
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,523
AND IF YOU WANT TO MODEL THIS, 

691
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,291
YOU HAVE EXPECTATIONS NOT JUST 

692
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,561
ABOUT THIS MONTH, BUT THE NEXT 

693
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,998
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 

694
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:40,966
10 COMING YEARS. 

695
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,833
THE MOMENT PRESIDENT DONALD 

696
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,702
TRUMP WAS ELECTED, IN EQUITY 

697
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,904
MARKETS AND SURVEYS, PEOPLE 

698
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,339
RATCHETED UP EXPECTATIONS FOR 

699
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,641
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE 

700
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:49,907
ECONOMY. 

701
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:50,508
PERHAPS EVERYBODY BUT CLINTON 

702
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,109
SUPPORTERS WERE DOING THAT 

703
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,046
AFTER THE ELECTION AND THE FACT 

704
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,747
IS, THE EXPECTATIONS TURNED OUT 

705
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,215
TO BE RATIONAL BECAUSE THE 

706
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:57,816
TURNAROUND THEY EXPECTED IS 

707
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,284
SOMETHING WE SEE IN THE DATA. 

708
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,053
LET ME HANDED BACK TO SARAH AND 

709
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,921
I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING THAT 

710
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,456
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO FOLLOW UP 

711
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,358
AND TALK ABOUT THE DATA, AND 

712
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,961
YOU CAN TELL I LIKE TO DO THAT, 

713
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:10,962
FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO 

714
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,332
CONNECT WITH ME OVER AT THE 

715
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:14,833
CEO. 

716
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,568
>>> THANK YOU, KEVIN. 

717
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,303
A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS AND 

718
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,305
UPDATES AND THEN I WILL TAKE 

719
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:20,672
HER QUESTIONS. 

720
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,240
LAST WEEK, THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

721
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,875
COMMITTEE UNDER CHAIRMAN 

722
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,477
GRASSLEY CONDUCTED A THOROUGH 

723
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,511

AMPLE TIME TO THOROUGHLY REVIEW 

726
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,949
THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT 

727
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,284
KAVANAUGH. 

728
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,952
UNFORTUNATELY, MANY COMMITTEE 

729
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,287
DEMOCRATS AND PROTESTERS 

730
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,255
ATTEMPTED TO TURN THE HEARING 

731
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,257
INTO A CIRCUS. 

732
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,926
NONETHELESS, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

733
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:41,493
DEMONSTRATED EXACTLY WHERE 

734
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,595
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP NOMINATED

735
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:43,795
HIM. 

736
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,264

00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,044
HE WAS LARGER THAN LIFE, 

790
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,046

MOST HONORABLE AND DEDICATED

ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND HE 

798
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,559
WAS AMONG THE VERY BEST. 

799

HE WAS ASSIGNED TO CHIEF OF

OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN AND AGENT 

803
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,066
JOHNSON WILL BE GREATLY MIST

AND HE WILL BE -- WE EXTEND OUR 

805
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,607
PRAYERS TO THE FAMILY. 

806
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,510
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID ON FRIDAY 

807
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,545
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD 

808
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,479
IDEA FOR JEFF SESSIONS TO LOOK 

809
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,146
INTO THE ANONYMOUS OP-ED. 

810
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:43,415
IS THERE ANYTHING WRITTEN THAT 

811
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,486
WOULD WARRANT AN INVESTIGATION 

812
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,119
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE? 

813
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,987
>> CERTAINLY IF THERE IS AN 

814
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,688
INDIVIDUAL, WHETHER OR NOT 

815
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:55,160
SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY 

816
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,428
ARE, IF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS IN 

817
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,028
MEETINGS THAT WERE NATIONAL 

818
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,330
SECURITY WAS DISCUSSED OR OTHER 

819
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,236
IMPORTANT TOPICS AND THEY ARE 

820
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,403
ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE THE 

821
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,003
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THAT WOULD 

822
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:06,671
CERTAINLY BE PROBLEMATIC AND 

823
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,139
SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT OF 

824
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:11,543
JUSTICE SHOULD LOOK INTO. 

825
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,377
>> THE MISUSE OF CLASSIFIED 

826
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,378
INFORMATION, WHAT REALM WOULD 

827
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,547
THAT FALLEN? 

828
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:17,749
>> IT IS FOR THEM TO MAKE THAT 

829
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,116
DETERMINATION. 

830
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:23,288
>> A QUICK FOLLOW-UP. 

831
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,488
IS THE WHITE HOUSE ACTIVELY 

832
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,725
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO THIS 

833
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,526
PERSON IS OR DO YOU NOT REALLY 

834
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,894
CARE AND ARE MOVING ONTO OTHER 

835
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:30,127
THINGS? 

836
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:31,263
>> WE ARE FOCUSING ON THINGS 

837
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,099
THAT ACTUALLY MATTER AND A STAFF

838
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,868
THAT IS HERE TO DO THEIR JOB 

839
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,103
AND NOT UNDERMINE THE GREAT 

840
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:38,970
WORK THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS 

841
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,503
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. 

842
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:40,438
WE WILL CONTINUE FOCUSING ON 

843
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,641
THAT AND FRANKLY, IT'S SAD AND 

844
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,642
PATHETIC THAT A GUTLESS 

845
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,611
ANONYMOUS SOURCE COULD RECEIVE 

846
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,812
SO MUCH ATTENTION FROM THE 

847
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:53,351
MEDIA. 

848
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,285
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

849
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:55,787
WILL BE MUCH BETTER SERVED IF 

850
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,454
WE ACTUALLY SPENT TIME TALKING 

851
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:59,190
ABOUT SOME OF THE REALLY 

852
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,293
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT ARE 

853
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,827
FACING OUR COUNTRY AND THINGS 

854
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,363
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS DOING TO 

855
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:05,730
HELP FIX THEM. 

856
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:05,963
JUSTIN? 

857
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:08,066
>> HAS THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED A 

858
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,035
LETTER FROM THE STATE 

859
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,536
DEPARTMENT AND CAN YOU SHARE 

860
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,471
DETAILS ABOUT THE CONTENT AND 

861
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,272
TONE OR ANY COMMITMENTS OR 

862
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:14,539
REQUESTS? 

863
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,340
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS RECEIVED A 

864
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,208
LETTER FROM KIM JONG-UN. IT WAS 

865
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,109
A VERY WARM AND POSITIVE LETTER 

866
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:24,049
AND WE WILL RELEASE THE FULL 

867
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:24,716
LETTER UNLESS THE NORTH KOREAN 

868
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,616
LEADER AGREES THAT WE SHOULD. 

869
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:26,217
THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE 

870
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:32,057
LETTER WAS TO REQUEST AND LOOK 

871
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,192
TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER MEETING 

872
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,226
WITH THE PRESIDENT, WHICH WE 

873
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,428
ARE OPEN TO AND ARE ALREADY IN 

874
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,529
THE PROCESS OF COORDINATING 

875
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,265
BED. 

876
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,966
THE RECENT PARADE IN NORTH 

877
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:45,637
KOREA, FOR ONCE, WAS NOT ABOUT 

878
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,871
THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL AND THE 

879
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,073
PRESIDENT HAS ACHIEVED 

880
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,474
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH HIS 

881
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,076
POLICY, SO FAR AND THIS IS 

882
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,243
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS IN 

883
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,345
THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THERE ARE 

884
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:55,613
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE 

885
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:55,946
TAKEN PLACE. 

886
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:56,915
REMAINS HAVE COME BACK AND 

887
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,552
HOSTAGES HAVE RETURNED AND 

888
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,954
THERE'S NO TESTING OF MISSILES 

889
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,921
AND NUCLEAR MATERIAL AND OF 

890
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,290
COURSE, THE HISTORIC SUMMIT 

891
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,757
BETWEEN THE LEADERS. 

892
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,458
THIS LETTER IS FURTHER 

893
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,225
INDICATION OF THE PROGRESS WE 

894
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:11,496
<font color="#FF0000">OPE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE. </font>

895
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,299
>> THE MEETING WOULD BE IN 

896
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:14,599
WASHINGTON? 

897
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,468
>> WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE 

898
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,268
HAVE FURTHER DETAILS. 

899
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,703
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE 

900
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,840
WANT TO TAKE PLACE AND WE ARE 

901
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,242
ALREADY WORKING TO MAKE THAT 

902
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:24,475
HAPPEN. 

903
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,577
>> TO FOLLOW-UP, YOU MENTION 

904
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:27,612
REMAINS BEING RETURNED AND 

905
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:28,446
HOSTAGES AND THE LACK OF 

906
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,748
TESTING, ALL HAPPENING WHEN THE 

907
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:35,553
PRESIDENT CITED A LACK OF 

908
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,855
PROGRESS AND CANCELED SECRETARY 

909
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:37,222
POMPEO'S TRIP. 

910
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:37,856
OTHER THAN THESE REALLY NICE 

911
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,656
WORDS FROM KIM JONG-UN AND THE 

912
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,924
PARADE, WHAT SIGNS OF PROGRESS 

913
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,027
WARRANT THIS NEW OPTIMISM FROM 

914
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:47,499
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

915
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,702
>> AGAIN, CERTAINLY THE MOST 

916
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,536
RECENT PARADE THIS WEEKEND, ONE 

917
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,971
OF THE FIRST TIMES, I BELIEVE, 

918
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:59,978
WE HAVE HAD A PARADE THAT WASN'T

919
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,613
HIGHLIGHTING THE NUCLEAR 

920
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,148
ARSENAL AND WE CONSIDER THAT A 

921
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:03,848
SIGN OF GOOD FAITH. 

922
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,682
AGAIN, THE LETTER FROM KIM JONG-

923
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,849
UN TO THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY 

924
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:11,089
SHOWS A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING

925
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,792
CONVERSATIONS AND CONTINUING TO 

926
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,294
WORK ON THE PROGRESS THEY HAVE 

927
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,096
HAD SINCE THEIR MEETING JUST A 

928
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,465
FEW MONTHS AGO AND ALSO, A 

929
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,767
CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO FOCUS ON

930
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,767
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE 

931
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:24,101
PENINSULA. 

932
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:26,003
>> A QUESTION ON BOB WOODWARD. 

933
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,939
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES

934
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,708
TO CALL HIM A LIAR AND SAYS HIS 

935
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,443
BOOK IS COMPLETELY FICTION. 

936
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:33,811
HE ALSO MENTIONED LIBEL LAWS 

937
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,146
QUITE A BIT. 

938
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:35,679
IS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 

939
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,313
CONSIDERING FILING A LAWSUIT 

940
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:36,714
AGAINST WOODWARD? 

941
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,848
>> WE WILL CERTAINLY KEEP YOU 

942
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:41,586
POSTED. 

943
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,253
WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY CLEAR FROM 

944
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,321
THE BEGINNING AND MANY OF THE 

945
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,556
SOURCES HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OUT 

946
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,690
TO REFUTE A COUPLE OF THEM. 

947
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,294
CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY 

948
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,295
AGGRESSIVELY PUSHED BACK AND 

949
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,564
GENERAL MATTERS AGGRESSIVELY 

950
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,932
PUSHED BACK ON THE CLAIMS AND 

951
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:59,838
JOHN DOWD IS ALSO PUSHING BACK 

952
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,072
AGAINST THE THINGS ATTRIBUTED 

953
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,607
TO HIM AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 

954
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:04,743
HAVE COME OUT TO SAY THAT 

955
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,543
WOODWARD NEVER EVEN REACHED OUT 

956
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,110
TO CORROBORATE STATEMENTS 

957
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,945
ATTRIBUTED TO THEM. 

958
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:13,852
IT SEEMS INCREDIBLY RECKLESS 

959
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,787
FOR A BOOK TO MAKE SUCH 

960
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,789
OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS AND TO NOT 

961
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,191
EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO GET A $10 

962
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,626
FACT CHECKER TO CALL AROUND AND 

963
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,694
VERIFY THE QUOTES WERE 

964
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:22,994
HAPPENING. 

965
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,830
NO EFFORT WAS MADE AND IT SEEMS 

966
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,765
LIKE A CARELESS AND RECKLESS 

967
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:28,399
WAY TO WRITE A BOOK. 

968
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:28,599
JOHN? 

969
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,601
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS 

970
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,568
LOOKING WHETHER HE SHOULD TAKE 

971
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:42,914
ACTION FOR THE WRITER OF THE 

972
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:43,314
ANONYMOUS OP-ED. 

973
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,048
DOES HE NOT THINK THAT IS 

974
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:44,749
PROTECTED BY THE FIRST 

975
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,049
AMENDMENT? 

976
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:45,650
DOES HE REALLY THINK THE 

977
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,217
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD 

978
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:46,851
CONTEMPLATE ACTION AGAINST A 

979
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:47,518
NEWSPAPER FOR PUBLISHING AN 

980
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:47,785
ARTICLE? 

981
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:50,121
>> IT'S LESS ABOUT THAT PART OF 

982
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,091
IT AND WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY 

983
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,325
WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO 

984
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,026
UNDERMINE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

985
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,027
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND A DULY 

986
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:56,928
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

987
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,161
STATES. 

988
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,297
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF 

989
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,164
THAT PROCESS, THEY SHOULDN'T BE 

990
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:00,364
HERE. 

991
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:01,866
>> HE TWEETED EARLIER AND IT'S 

992
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:07,472
BEEN A WILD SINCE WE'VE TALKED 

993
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,376
TO YOU, SO THIS GOES BACK A 

994
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:11,709
LITTLE WHILE. 

995
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,477
HE TWEETED LAST WEEK SUGGESTING 

996
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,413
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 

997
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,581
SHOULD NOT BE INVESTIGATING, 

998
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,716
SHOULD NOT BE PROSECUTING THE 

999
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,418
TWO REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN 

1000
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,154
BECAUSE IT MIGHT HURT REPUBLICAN

1001
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,789
CHANCES IN NOVEMBER. 

1002
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,424
IS THE PRESIDENT REALLY TRYING 

1003
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,292
TO SUGGEST OR OUTRIGHT SAYING 

1004
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,159
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 

1005
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,094
SHOULDN'T BE INVESTIGATING OR 

1006
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,830
PROSECUTING ALLIES OF THE 

1007
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,231
PRESIDENT IF IT MIGHT HURT THE 

1008
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,231
POLITICAL CHANCES OF THE PARTY? 

1009
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:35,432
>> CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT 

1010
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:37,268
THINKS NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. 

1011
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,569
WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A 

1012
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:44,409
FAIR PLAYING FIELD AND THAT 

1013
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,377
THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN A NUMBER 

1014
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:46,910
OF CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT 

1015
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,046
INDIVIDUALS IN THE FBI AND THE 

1016
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:48,813
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT HAVE 

1017
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,181
BEEN IGNORED AND WE LIKE TO SEE 

1018
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:54,252
THOSE LOOKED AT, AS WELL. 

1019
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,154
>> THEY DON'T WANT TO GO 

1020
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,288
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY ARE 

1021
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,056
ALLIES? 

1022
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,358
>> I CAN'T WEIGH-IN ON AN 

1023
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,125
ACTIVE INVESTIGATION BUT I CAN 

1024
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,927
TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T 

1025
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,529
THINK ANYBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW 

1026
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,564
AND WE ARE SIMPLY STATING THERE 

1027
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,932
SHOULD BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN OF 

1028
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,167
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE 

1029
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,034
HAPPENED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1030
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:10,969
JUSTICE AND THE FBI AND WE'D 

1031
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,339
LIKE TO SEE THOSE LOOKED AT, AS 

1032
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:14,539
WELL. 

1033
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,442
>> HOW SOON WOULD YOU LIKE TO 

1034
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,509
HAVE THIS SECOND MEETING? 

1035
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,978
>> I DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ON 

1036
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:20,844
THE EXACT TIMING. 

1037
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:22,246
AS THESE MEETINGS TAKE PLACE 

1038
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:23,882
NOW AND AS WE HAVE MORE 

1039
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,817
DETAILS, I WILL CERTAINLY LET 

1040
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,084
YOU KNOW. 

1041
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,253
>> CAN YOU UPDATE US ON WHERE 

1042
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:29,920
THE TRADE TALKS STAND? 

1043
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,389
>> WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING 

1044
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,157
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 

1045
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,259
CANADIANS AND ARE HOPEFUL WE 

1046
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,893
WILL COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH 

1047
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:36,627
THEM. 

1048
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:36,827
JEFF? 

1049
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,596
>> SARAH, DOES THE PRESENT 

1050
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,565
BELIEVE THE DENIALS HAVE BEEN 

1051
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,234
COMING IN FOR THE TOP ADVISORS 

1052
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,134
OR IT DOES HE BELIEVE IT IS 

1053
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,037
SOMEONE FROM WITHIN? 

1054
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,272
DOES HE BELIEVE THAT LIE 

1055
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:49,440
DETECTOR TEST SHOULD BE ISSUED 

1056
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,875
AS THE VICE PRESIDENT 

1057
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,475
VOLUNTEERED TO DO ON SUNDAY? 

1058
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,176
>> NO LIE DETECTORS ARE BEING 

1059
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,379
USED OR TALKED ABOUT. 

1060
00:31:54,379 --> 00:32:02,220
OR, LOOKED AT AS A POSSIBILITY. 

1061
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,221
FRANKLY, THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

1062
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,155
STAFF ARE FOCUSED ON DOING OUR 

1063
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,890
JOBS AND TRYING TO SHOW UP 

1064
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,526
EVERY DAY AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO 

1065
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,961
HELP BETTER THE AMERICAN 

1066
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:10,828
PEOPLE, NOT DEAL WITH COWARDS 

1067
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:11,763
THAT REFUSED TO PUT THEIR NAMES 

1068
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,766
IN AN ANONYMOUS LETTER. 

1069
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:16,501
>> HE TWEETED SOMETHING ON 

1070
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,101
FRIDAY AFTER GEORGE 

1071
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,136
PAPADOPOULOS WAS SENTENCED TO 

1072
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:24,042
1428 DAYS -- TO 14 DAYS IN 

1073
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:24,275
PRISON. 

1074
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,810
WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT WITH 

1075
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,143
$28 MILLION? 

1076
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:26,877
>> I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND 

1077
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:27,511
CHECK ON THAT. 

1078
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:31,416
I DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT. 

1079
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,484
>> IS AT THE PRICE TAG OF THE 

1080
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,485
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION? 

1081
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,387
IF SO, IT'S HIGHLY INFLATED. 

1082
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,656
>> I'D HAVE TO CHECK ON THAT. 

1083
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,523
>> WILL HE TESTIFY? 

1084
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:41,292
>> THAT IS A MATTER FOR OUTSIDE 

1085
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:41,559
COUNSEL. 

1086
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,696
>> WHAT DOES HE PLAN TO SAY AND 

1087
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,696
WHAT DOES HE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH 

1088
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:46,397
WITH THIS 911 ADDRESS? 

1089
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,865
>> CERTAINLY THE FOCUS WILL BE 

1090
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:52,970
ON REMEMBERING THAT HORRIFIC DAY

1091
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,038
AND REMEMBERING THE LIVES THAT 

1092
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,239
WERE LOST IN CERTAINLY HONORING 

1093
00:32:55,239 --> 00:33:00,344
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT 

1094
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:01,479
ONLY LAWS THAT DAY BUT ALSO PUT 

1095
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,446
THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO HELP 

1096
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:05,550
IN THAT PROCESS. 

1097
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,818
HE WILL BE THERE AND THE VICE 

1098
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,385
PRESIDENT WILL BE IN 

1099
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,385
WASHINGTON, D.C. AT THE 

1100
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:11,689
PENTAGON. 

1101
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,690
>> SARAH, THANK YOU. 

1102
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,059
I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE READ BOB 

1103
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,662
WOODWARD'S BOOK. I 

1104
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,997
KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE. 

1105
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,264
AND WE EXPECT, OTHER THAN 

1106
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,099
REPEATING DENIALS FROM MATTIS 

1107
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,067
AND KELLY AND JOHN DOWD, CAN WE 

1108
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,435
EXPECT THE WHITE HOUSE TO GIVE 

1109
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,137
US A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS 

1110
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,138
THAT ARE WRONG AND NOT QUALIFY 

1111
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,540
WOODWARD TO BE A LIAR? 

1112
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,943
>> THAT WOULD BE A COMPLETE AND 

1113
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,010
UTTER WASTE OF OUR TIME. 

1114
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,377
SO, NO. 

1115
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:35,880
>> HOLD ON A SECOND. 

1116
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,648
IT SAYS 55% OF AMERICANS 

1117
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,218
BELIEVE THE OP-ED WRITER OF THE 

1118
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,552
TIMES IS RIGHT AND THE 

1119
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,920
PRESIDENT IS GETTING A 60% 

1120
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,789
NEGATIVE RATING ON THE HONEST 

1121
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:45,122
AND TRUTHFUL. 

1122
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,592
60% OF AMERICANS THINK HE IS A 

1123
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,493
DISHONEST PERSON. 

1124
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,527
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT THINK HE 

1125
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,028
COULD WIN A CREDIBILITY BATTLE 

1126
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,029
WITH BOB WOODWARD? 

1127
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,431
HE IS A MEMBER OF THE PRESS 

1128
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,765
CORPS AND HELPED TAKE RICHARD 

1129
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:56,333
NIXON DOWN AND IS A LEGEND. 

1130
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:59,337
HOW COULD HE WOULD NOT 

1131
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,003
CREDIBILITY BATTLE? 

1132
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:00,838
>> ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD 

1133
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:01,405
CERTAINLY RATHER TAKE THE 

1134
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:03,274
ACTUAL ON RECORD ACCOUNT FROM 

1135
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,009
PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE AND HAVE 

1136
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,078
BEEN WORKING IN THIS BUILDING 

1137
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,512
AND HAVE INTERACTED WITH THE 

1138
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,447
PRESIDENT DAY IN AND DAY OUT 

1139
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:11,882
LIKE GENERAL MEDICINE GENERAL 

1140
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:12,550
KELLY AND LIKE MYSELF, NOT 

1141
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,717
DISGRUNTLED FORMER EMPLOYEES 

1142
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:16,020
THAT REFUSED TO PUT THEIR NAME 

1143
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,456
ON THINGS WHEN THEY COME OUT TO 

1144
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:20,524
ATTACK THE PRESIDENT. 

1145
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:22,827
I THINK THOSE ARE FAR MORE 

1146
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,262
CREDIBLE SOURCES AND CERTAINLY 

1147
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,530
FAR MORE RELIABLE VOICES WITHIN 

1148
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,630
THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THEY 

1149
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,498
CAN ACCURATELY TELL WHAT HAS 

1150
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,701
TAKEN PLACE IN THE BUILDING. 

1151
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,703
>> IS THE PRESIDENT A CREDIBLE 

1152
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:33,004
VOICE? 

1153
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:33,737
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

1154
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:34,338
JOHN? 

1155
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,540
>> YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1156
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,641
SAID A LOT ABOUT THE 

1157
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,742
PUBLICATION OF THIS OP-ED AND 

1158
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,511
YOU'VE CALLED IT IN THE 

1159
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,646
PRESIDENT HAS CALLED IT A 

1160
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,648
BETRAYAL AND YOU'VE CALLED IT 

1161
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,315
AN ACT OF DISLOYALTY. 

1162
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,583
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MENTIONED

1163
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:50,054
QUITE A FEW TIMES, EVEN IN THIS 

1164
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,156
BRIEFING, AND HAS CALLED ON THE 

1165
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:52,723
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO 

1166
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,424
INVESTIGATE THE PUBLICATION OF 

1167
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:53,724
THIS OP-ED. 

1168
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,759
THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF THE 

1169
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,793
CRIMINAL CODE THAT GOES ALONG 

1170
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,830
WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THIS OP-

1171
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,431
ED. 

1172
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,599
I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT 

1173
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,399
IT IS THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES 

1174
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,734
MAY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED IN THE 

1175
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:08,940
BOOK AS RELATES TO THE 

1176
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,240
PUBLICATION OF THIS OP-ED 

1177
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,474
PIECE? 

1178
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:11,075
>> ONCE AGAIN, WE CONSIDER 

1179
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:11,776
SOMEBODY ACTIVELY TRYING TO 

1180
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,409
UNDERMINE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

1181
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:15,746
OF OUR GOVERNMENT INAPPROPRIATE 

1182
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,514
AND SOME THINGS TO CAUSE 

1183
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,582
CONCERN AND THEY SHOULD TAKE A 

1184
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:21,652
LOOK AT IT. 

1185
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,887
>> WHAT WAS THE VIOLATION? 

1186
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:23,988
>> IT GIVES A GREAT LEVEL OF 

1187
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:28,559
CONCERN AND THEY SHOULD LOOK 

1188
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,627
INTO IT. 

1189
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,295
>> I'M CONCERNED. 

1190
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,364
IT'S NOT A VIOLATION OF LAW. 

1191
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,432
>> I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY. 

1192
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,267
IT'S FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1193
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,301
JUSTICE TO MAKE THAT 

1194
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,269
DETERMINATION WE ARE ASKING 

1195
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,038
THEM TO LOOK INTO IT AND MAKE 

1196
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,072
THAT DETERMINATION AND THEY 

1197
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:43,574
CERTAINLY ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF 

1198
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:43,874
DOING THAT. 

1199
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:44,508
SOMEBODY ACTIVELY TRYING TO 

1200
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:45,075
UNDERMINE THE DULY ELECTED 

1201
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:48,246
PRESIDENT OF THE ENTIRE 

1202
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,680
EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT 

1203
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,849
SEEMS PROBLEMATIC TO ME AND 

1204
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,651
SOMETHING THEY SHOULD TAKE A 

1205
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:53,918
LOOK AT. 

1206
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:54,685
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

1207
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,853
JUST TO SPECIFY THIS A BIT, IS 

1208
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,820
THE WHITE HOUSE TREATING THE 

1209
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,589
ANONYMOUS OP-ED WRITER AS A 

1210
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:07,964
FULL-FLEDGED BREACH OF SECURITY 

1211
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:08,266
MATTER? 

1212
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,767
IS THE FBI INVESTIGATING BOTH 

1213
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:10,867
STAFF AND THE MEANS OF 

1214
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:11,234
COMMUNICATIONS? 

1215
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:12,503
CELL PHONES AND COMPUTERS AND 

1216
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,337
THE LIKE? 

1217
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,605
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT LEVEL. 

1218
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:15,439
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD 

1219
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:20,211
BE PART OF. 

1220
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,579
CERTAINLY, AS I JUST TOLD YOUR 

1221
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:23,614
COLLIE, WE THINK THERE IS A 

1222
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,849
CONCERN HERE AND IT SHOULD BE 

1223
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,182
LOOKED INTO. 

1224
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,049
>> ONE OF THE QUESTION. 

1225
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,084
OBVIOUSLY, THE WHOLE WORLD 

1226
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:34,926
WATCHED WHEN THE FRONT RUNNING 

1227
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:35,426
BRAZILIAN PRESIDENTIAL 

1228
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,361
CANDIDATE WAS STABBED LAST 

1229
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:37,561
<u>EEK. </u>

1230
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:38,161
HAS THE PRESIDENT CALLED OR 

1231
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,164
SENT A STATEMENT TO HIS FAMILY? 

1232
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,566
>> I'M NOT AWARE THAT THE 

1233
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,700
PRESIDENT HAS BUT I DO BELIEVE 

1234
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,968
MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION 

1235
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,936
HAVE REACHED OUT AND I WILL 

1236
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,538
WORK TO GET YOU THE SPECIFICS 

1237
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,272
OF WHO THAT WAS. 

1238
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:48,506
DAVID? 

1239
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,440
>> WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT MAKE 

1240
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,608
OF THIS TALK OF THE 25TH 

1241
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:55,079
AMENDMENT AND SOME OF WHAT HE 

1242
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,447
HEARS ON MEDIA OUTLETS 

1243
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,748
REGARDING THE WORD CRAZY TALK? 

1244
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,483
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF 

1245
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,951
TALK ABOUT THAT ON MANY OF THE 

1246
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:01,518
MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS. 

1247
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,453
>> I THINK WE WOULD SAY THAT 

1248
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,954
IT'S ABOUT AS RIDICULOUS AS 

1249
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:10,461
MOST OF BOB WOODWARD'S BOOK. 

1250
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,697
THE FACT THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY 

1251
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,432
BEING HONESTLY DISCUSSED IS 

1252
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,467
RIDICULOUS AND FRANKLY, 

1253
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,468
INSULTING TO THE NEARLY 62 

1254
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,870
MILLION PEOPLE THAT CAME OUT 

1255
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,504
AND OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED 

1256
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,239
THIS PRESIDENT HAD VOTED FOR 

1257
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,442
HIM AND SUPPORTED HIS AGENDA 

1258
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,309
AND ARE WATCHING AND CHEERING 

1259
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,077
ON AS HE SUCCESSFULLY 

1260
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,044
IMPLEMENTS THAT AGENDA EVERY 

1261
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,447
SINGLE DAY. 

1262
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,650
>> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE AS 

1263
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,151
TO WHAT DOCUMENTS THE PRESIDENT 

1264
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,252
IS CONSIDERING FOR 

1265
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,554
DECLASSIFICATION IN THE NEXT 

1266
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:36,854
TWO WEEKS? 

1267
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,622
WHEN, EXACTLY, CAN WE EXPECT 

1268
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:38,822
THEM? 

1269
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:39,824
>> WHEN WE HAVE SPECIFICS ON 

1270
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,691
THAT, WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 

1271
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,194
>> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF 

1272
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:43,961
WHAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE? 

1273
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,797
>> I CAN'T SAY RIGHT NOW. 

1274
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,698
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 

1275
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:51,368
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE 

1276
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:52,503
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS. 

1277
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,070
THE PALESTINIAN MISSION IS 

1278
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,472
CLOSED IN WASHINGTON AND THE 

1279
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,875
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. ACCUSES 

1280
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,343
THIS COUNTRY OF MURDERING THE 

1281
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,144
PEACE PROCESS AND UNDERMINING 

1282
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,579
ITS ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS. 

1283
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:03,714
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID IT IS 

1284
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,682
NOT RETREATING FROM THE EFFORTS 

1285
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,449
TO ACHIEVE A LASTING AND 

1286
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:11,822
COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AND THAT IS 

1287
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,155
THE PROCESS? 

1288
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:13,023
>> WE'VE BEEN VERY UPFRONT 

1289
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,125
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND THE 

1290
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,226
FACT THAT WE WANT TO SEE PEACE 

1291
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,795
AND WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE 

1292
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,198
CONVERSATIONS AND WE WANT TO 

1293
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,234
HELP BROKER THAT DEAL AND WE 

1294
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,067
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE PUSHING 

1295
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:24,334
FORWARD. 

1296
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,002
BEYOND THAT, I DON'T HAVE 

1297
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:25,702
ANYTHING SPECIFIC ON IT TODAY. 

1298
00:38:25,702 --> 00:38:28,539
>> THE U.S. CAN NO LONGER BE 

1299
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:37,047
INVOLVED AND IS THAT NOT THE 

1300
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:37,247
CASE? 

1301
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,949
>> CERTAINLY, WE HAVE A GREAT 

1302
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,084
DEAL OF SUPPORT WITH OUR FRIEND 

1303
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,319
AND ALLY IN ISRAEL BUT WE ARE 

1304
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:43,087
AS COMMITTED TODAY AS WE'VE 

1305
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:47,290
EVER BEEN TO THE PEACE PROCESS. 

1306
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,125
>> ON FRIDAY, THE PRESIDENT 

1307
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,360
TALKED ABOUT A TRADE DEAL WITH 

1308
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:56,534
INDIA. 

1309
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,535
>> I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF 

1310
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,068
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS 

1311
00:38:58,068 --> 00:38:59,203
RECENTLY CAME BACK FROM INDIA 

1312
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:04,275
AND EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS 

1313
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,376
TO NEGOTIATE NEW AND BETTER 

1314
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,343
TRADE DEALS AND THOSE 

1315
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:07,044
CONVERSATIONS ARE AT THE 

1316
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:07,444
BEGINNING STAGES. 

1317
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:08,446
WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED FURTHER 

1318
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:12,449
IN THE PROCESS. 

1319
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:15,152
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON 

1320
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,188
STEVEN'S QUESTION ON THE PEACE 

1321
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:17,454
PROCESS. 

1322
00:39:17,454 --> 00:39:18,255
YOU SAY THE DOOR IS OPENED AND 

1323
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,123
YOU ARE WORKING ON IT. 

1324
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,392
IS IT REALISTIC FOR THE 

1325
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,926
PRESIDENT TO BELIEVE YOU CAN 

1326
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:25,362
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE 

1327
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,197
MIDDLE EAST IN HIS FIRST TERM 

1328
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,264
IN OFFICE, AS HIS PROMISE TO 

1329
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:27,430
DO? 

1330
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,466
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN 

1331
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:37,574
STEPS THAT PALESTINIANS HAVE 

1332
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:38,208
SAID DO NOT HELP. 

1333
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,210
>> AGAIN, CERTAINLY WE ARE VERY 

1334
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,010
MUCH COMMITTED TO THE PROCESS 

1335
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,111
AND ARE HOPEFUL WE CAN GET 

1336
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:41,345
THERE. 

1337
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:41,878
>> JOHN BOLTON SAID THE 

1338
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:43,614
ADMINISTRATION WOULD SANCTION 

1339
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,816
AND IN THE REPORT THAT SEEMS TO 

1340
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,818
BE AN AVERSION TO PUSH THE 

1341
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,654
POLICIES, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THE 

1342
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,556
ADMINISTRATION IS SHIFTING TO A 

1343
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,059
MORE HARD-LINE STANCE TO THE 

1344
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:55,259
ICC? 

1345
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,726
WHY IS THE USO CONCERN? 

1346
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:59,864
>> CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT IS 

1347
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,165
COMMITTED TO DEFENDING THE 

1348
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,233
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE 

1349
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,600
SECURITY INTERESTS INCLUDING 

1350
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,703
USING ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO 

1351
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,539
PROTECT OUR CITIZENS, THOSE OF 

1352
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,407
OUR ALLIES FROM UNJUST 

1353
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,808
PROSECUTION BY THE ICC. 

1354
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:13,310
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY 

1355
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,245
WOULD CONSIDER AN INVESTIGATION 

1356
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,413
INTO U.S. SOLDIERS IN 

1357
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,715
AFGHANISTAN IS A THREAT TO 

1358
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,315
AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY AND IF 

1359
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,150
THEY PROCEED WITH THAT, THE 

1360
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,017
U.S. WOULD CONSIDER THOSE 

1361
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,185
OPTIONS THAT AMBASSADOR BOLTON 

1362
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,588
LAID OUT TODAY. 

1363
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,691
>> IF THE ICC IS, IN FACT DEAD 

1364
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,126
TO YOU, AS JOHN BOLTON SAID 

1365
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,095
TODAY, WHAT IS THE CONCERN THAT 

1366
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,462
THE U.S. HAS? 

1367
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,697
>> THEY TOLD US THEY WERE ON 

1368
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:34,899
THE VERGE OF MAKING THAT 

1369
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,467
DECISION AND WE ARE LETTING 

1370
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,868
THEM KNOW OUR POSITION AHEAD OF 

1371
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:38,335
MAKING THAT DECISION. 

1372
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,938
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 

1373
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,171
DAVID? 

1374
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:41,839
>> THE EDITOR OF THE GLOBAL 

1375
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,645
TIMES, IN BEIJING, THE PREMIER 

1376
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,512
FOREIGN POLICY OUTLET, WROTE ON 

1377
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,080
TWITTER THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1378
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,517
BLAMES CHINA ON NORTH KOREA, 

1379
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,585
QUITE A BIT. 

1380
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,120
NOW THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE 

1381
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,188
IMPROVEMENT IN THE NORTH KOREAN 

1382
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,022
STANCE, DOES CHINA DESERVE SOME 

1383
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:58,255
CREDIT? 

1384
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:58,756
HE SUGGESTED THEY DO. 

1385
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,456
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? 

1386
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:05,596
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT 

1387
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,231
DESERVES THE CREDIT IN THIS 

1388
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:07,498
PROCESS. 

1389
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,334
HE HAS BEEN THE LEAD VOICE AND 

1390
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,203
THE ONE THAT PUT THE INITIAL 

1391
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:14,938
PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. 

1392
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:16,106
CERTAINLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1393
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,475
VERY PUBLICLY EXPRESSED HIS 

1394
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,442
GRATITUDE TOWARD PRESIDENT Xi 

1395
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,411
FOR THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAYED 

1396
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,146
AND HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE 

1397
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,613
THEM CONTINUE TO STEP UP AND DO 

1398
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:24,114
MORE. 

1399
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:24,848
FRANKLY, WOULD STILL LIKE TO 

1400
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:26,282
SEE THEM STEP UP AND DO MORE. 

1401
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:28,819
THE CREDIT IN THE PROCESS AT 

1402
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,089
THIS POINT AND WHERE WE ARE, I 

1403
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,256
WOULD SAY, BELONGS TO PRESIDENT 

1404
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,059
TRUMP AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO 

1405
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,927
HOPEFULLY WORK WITH PRESIDENT 

1406
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,596
Xi AND HIS TERM AND 

1407
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,930
ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE 

1408
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,197
PROGRESS. 

1409
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,932
>> GIVEN A SECOND MEETING, IT 

1410
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,302
SOUND LIKE WITH KIM JONG-UN, 

1411
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,237
DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT 

1412
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,237
HE HAS TO NEGOTIATE ALMOST 

1413
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,105
PERSONALLY WITH KIM JONG-UN, 

1414
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,473
GIVEN THAT THINGS MAY GO POORLY 

1415
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,240
AND THAT HAVE TO RESCHEDULE 

1416
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,974
ANOTHER MEETING? 

1417
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:58,048
>> I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S GONE 

1418
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,683
POORLY CONSIDERING STEPS HAVE 

1419
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,684
BEEN TAKEN BY THE NORTH KOREANS 

1420
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,286
TO SHOW SIGNS OF GOOD FAITH. 

1421
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,253
>> PROGRESS? 

1422
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:04,555
>> OTHER STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 

1423
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,190
AND IT WOULDN'T SAY IT'S GONE 

1424
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,890
POORLY. 

1425
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,627
AT THE END OF THE DAY, 

1426
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,261
ULTIMATELY, IT IS BEST WHEN YOU 

1427
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:13,030
CAN HAVE THE TWO LEADERS SIT 

1428
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,497
DOWN. 

1429
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:14,097
PARTICULARLY, FROM THE NORTH 

1430
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:14,431
KOREAN SIDE. 

1431
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,332
WE KNOW MOST OF THE DECISIONS 

1432
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,766
WILL HAVE TO BE RUN THROUGH KIM 

1433
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:20,404
JONG-UN AND CERTAINLY HE WILL 

1434
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,805
WANT TO TALK TO HIS COUNTERPART 

1435
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,341
IN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WE THINK 

1436
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,309
IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE ARE GLAD 

1437
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,009
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. 

1438
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:26,510
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 

1439
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,148
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 

1440
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,349
>> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THE 

1441
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,418
WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING FOR 

1442
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,719
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR. 

1443
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,455
THE FIRST ONE IN NEARLY THREE 

1444
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,091
WEEKS AND IT STARTED WITH AN 

1445
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:41,491
ECONOMIC MESSAGE. 

1446
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:42,860
KEVIN HASSETT, THE ECONOMIC 

1447
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,128
ADVISERS, SHOWED A SERIES OF 

1448
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,462
CHARTS THAT ATTEMPTED TO MAKE 

1449
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,032
THE CASE THAT IT ISN'T A 

1450
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,600
CONTINUATION OF THE GROWTH 

1451
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,634
STARTED IN THE OBAMA YEARS BUT 

1452
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,436
A TRUMP SPECIFIC TREND THAT THE 

1453
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:52,903
ECONOMY IS SHOWING. 

1454
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,639
HE DID FESS UP TO THE PRESIDENT 

1455
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,008
MAKING A MISTAKE IN A TWEET 

1456
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,242
EARLIER THIS MORNING. 

1457
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:00,911
IT'S NOT 100 YEARS SINCE GDP IS 

1458
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,713
BETTER THAN THE UNEMPLOYMENT 

1459
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,948
RATE, JUST 10, HE CONCEDED. 

1460
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:05,849
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE 

1461
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,483
PRESIDENT GOT THE WRONG NUMBER 

1462
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,684
AND THEN SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS 

1463
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:22,365
MADE SOME NEWS. 

1464
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:23,032
SHE INDICATED THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1465
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:24,101
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM NORTH 

1466
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,835
KOREAN LEADER, KIM JONG OWN. 

1467
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:25,636
A WARM, POSITIVE LETTER IN HER 

1468
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,169
DESCRIPTION, THOUGH SHE 

1469
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:26,836
WOULDN'T GO INTO DETAILS. 

1470
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:27,771
SHE SAID IT MAINLY FOCUSED ON 

1471
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,772
THE NORTH KOREAN INTEREST IN 

1472
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,339
HAVING ANOTHER FACE-TO-FACE 

1473
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:29,973
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT DONALD 

1474
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:30,640
TRUMP AND THERE WERE QUESTIONS, 

1475
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,307
OF COURSE, ABOUT THE ANONYMOUS 

1476
00:43:31,307 --> 00:43:32,776
OP-ED PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK 

1477
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,778
TIMES AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

1478
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,547
ITS EFFORT TO FIND OUT WHO 

1479
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,247
WROTE THE OP-ED. 

1480
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,550
SHE SUGGESTED THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1481
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,418
JUSTICE SHOULD LOOK INTO WEATHER

1482
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,354
THE AUTHOR, IF THEY ARE 

1483
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,054
RECEIVING CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS, 

1484
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,057
IS IMPROPERLY DOING SO, GIVEN 

1485
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,225
THE AUTHOR'S CONCERNS ABOUT 

1486
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:51,295
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WHITE 

1487
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:51,528
HOUSE. 

1488
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,997
SHE SAID THEY ARE MORE 

1489
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,632
INTERESTED IN THINGS THAT ARE 

1490
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:56,065
ACTUALLY IMPORTANT. 

1491
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:57,267
WEIJIA JIANG WAS IN THE FRONT 

1492
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,903
ROW AND ASKED A COUPLE OF 

1493
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,806
QUESTIONS OF HUCKABEE SANDERS. 

1494
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,609
WHEN THERE IS A CONTROVERSY, 

1495
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:06,477
THIS WHITE HOUSE DISTRACTS WITH 

1496
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:06,944
ANOTHER CONTROVERSY. 

1497
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:07,611
THEY ALMOST ARE SEEM TO BE 

1498
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,779
DISTRACTING WITH WE ARE GOING 

1499
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:15,552
TO SAY WE WILL DEMONSTRATE OUR 

1500
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:16,253
COMPETENCE. 

1501
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,188
WHAT IS YOUR READ ON THE 

1502
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,290
MESSAGE THEY ARE TRYING TO 

1503
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:20,623
DRIVE TODAY? 

1504
00:44:20,623 --> 00:44:21,458
>> Reporter: I BELIEVE YOUR 

1505
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,226
QUESTION WAS ABOUT WEATHER THE 

1506
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,727
ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO 

1507
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:29,233
DISTRACT FROM THE DISTRACTIONS 

1508
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,200
BY ROLLING OUT THIS ECONOMIC 

1509
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,467
BRIEFING. 

1510
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:32,769
HE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 

1511
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:33,737
THAT. 

1512
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,673
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF 

1513
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,774
ECONOMIC ADVISERS ASKED IF IT 

1514
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,775
WAS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO WHAT 

1515
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,511
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID OVER THE 

1516
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,178
WEEKEND. 

1517
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:41,912
REMEMBER, THE ECONOMIC GROWTH 

1518
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:42,312
STARTED UNDER MY 

1519
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:47,017
ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID. 

1520
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,787
HE SAID THE ECONOMIC NUMBERS 

1521
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,121
WERE IN THE WORKS FOR WEEKS AND 

1522
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,322
CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT A DIRECT 

1523
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:52,855
RESPONSE TO ANYTHING BAD 

1524
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:55,993
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID. 

1525
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,295
BUT, IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT WAS 

1526
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,265
MEANT TO BE A DISTRACTION FROM 

1527
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,701
THE MAIN STORY LINES, YOU KNOW, 

1528
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:05,368
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T. 

1529
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:07,104
AS SOON AS SARAH HUCKABEE 

1530
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,106
SANDERS TOOK THE PODIUM, SHE 

1531
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,208
WAS SLAMMED WITH QUESTIONS THAT 

1532
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,575
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASK. 

1533
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,810
CERTAINLY, SINCE BOB WOODWARD'S 

1534
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,813
EXCERPTS FROM HIS BOOK CAME OUT 

1535
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,348
AND SINCE A NEW YORK TIMES OP-

1536
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:18,682
ED. 

1537
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,051
IN FACT, WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE 

1538
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,619
TO SPEAK TO SARAH HUCKABEE 

1539
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,555
SANDERS FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS 

1540
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,421
AND THOSE QUESTIONS CERTAINLY 

1541
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:27,524
DOMINATED THE HEADLINES AND SHE 

1542
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:28,458
WAS PREPARED FOR THEM. 

1543
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,660
SHE CONTINUED TO REGURGITATE 

1544
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,595
THE SAME MESSAGE, THE SAME 

1545
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:32,162
OFFICIAL WORD FROM THE 

1546
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,199
ADMINISTRATION THAT WE'VE HEARD 

1547
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:35,799
IN OTHER WAYS. 

1548
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,533
WHETHER FROM PRESIDENT DONALD 

1549
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,901
TRUMP OR FROM OTHER SENIOR 

1550
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,869
OFFICIALS WHO HAVE COME OUT AND 

1551
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,036
REALLY TRIED TO CHANGE THE 

1552
00:45:40,036 --> 00:45:46,810
NARRATIVE FROM BOTH THE 

1553
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,778
WOODWARD BOOK AND THE NEW YORK 

1554
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,145
TIMES OP-ED. 

1555
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,079
>> SPEAKING OF THE OP-ED, THE 

1556
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,213
WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE 

1557
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:55,719
INTERESTED IN DISCREDITING 

1558
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,921
AND/OR OUTING THE PERSON WHO 

1559
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,089
WROTE IT AND ALSO INTERESTED IN 

1560
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,456
MOVING FORWARD. 

1561
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,023
HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS ASKED 

1562
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:00,824
SPECIFICALLY WHETHER THEY WOULD 

1563
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:04,661
SUGGEST A WHITE HOUSE STAFFER 

1564
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:05,862
TO A LIE DETECTOR. 

1565
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:08,198
WHAT POSITION DOES THE WHITE 

1566
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,132
HOUSE SEEM TO BE TAKING ON 

1567
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:09,766
MOVING FORWARD ON THAT? 

1568
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,400
>> Reporter: SANDERS BRUSHED 

1569
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,904
OFF THE IDEA THAT LIE DETECTORS 

1570
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,540
COULD BE PART OF SCREENING 

1571
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,942
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS FOR 

1572
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,278
THEIR PART IN LEAKING 

1573
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,113
INFORMATION, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 

1574
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,448
BROUGHT UP BY VICE PRESIDENT 

1575
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,582
MIKE PENCE, WHO SAID HE WOULD 

1576
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,451
AGREE TO A LIE DETECTOR TEST. 

1577
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,619
SHE ALMOST LAUGHED IT OFF AND 

1578
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,454
SAID THAT IS NOT IN THE WORKS 

1579
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,222
AND THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT 

1580
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,224
THAT AND IT WOULD BE A PROTOCOL 

1581
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:35,425
HERE. 

1582
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:36,860
YOU ARE RIGHT. 

1583
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,630
SHE DID NOT DENY THAT THE 

1584
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,297
PRESIDENT, HIMSELF, IS FIXATED 

1585
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,733
WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING OUT 

1586
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,766
WHO THIS PERSON IS AND THAT'S 

1587
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:45,168
WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE VERY 

1588
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:49,039
BEGINNING. 

1589
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,275
IT'S THE OBSESSION THAT HAS BEEN

1590
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,611
TO FIND OUT WHO THE PERSON IS 

1591
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,546
AND TO PENALIZE THEM, SOMEHOW, 

1592
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:58,248
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE 

1593
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,783
CONTENT OF WHAT THE AUTHOR 

1594
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,017
WROTE. 

1595
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,053
THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE 

1596
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,455
BECAUSE SANDERS SAID, HE OR SHE 

1597
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:06,990
IS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO 

1598
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,423
NATIONAL SECURITY. 

1599
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:08,024
I HEARD YOU MENTION THAT SHE 

1600
00:47:08,024 --> 00:47:08,691
ALSO SAID THAT PERHAPS THE 

1601
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:12,695
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOULD 

1602
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:17,901
LOOK INTO THIS BUT SHE WAS NOT 

1603
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:18,701
ABLE TO ANSWER THE CRITICAL 

1604
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:18,968
QUESTION. 

1605
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:19,669
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS A 

1606
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:20,470
VERY SPECIFIC FUNCTION, TO 

1607
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,371
INVESTIGATE FEDERAL CRIMES AND 

1608
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,406
SHE WAS ASKED MULTIPLE TIMES, 

1609
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,439
WHAT IS THE CRIME THAT THE 

1610
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:25,609
WRITER COMMITTED BY EXPRESSING 

1611
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:34,885
THEIR VIEWS AND BY EXERCISING 

1612
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:35,952
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS? 

1613
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:37,587
SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY WHAT 

1614
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:39,088
LAW THE AUTHOR VIOLATED, IF 

1615
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:39,289
ANY. 

1616
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,192
SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A 

1617
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,560
LAWYER BUT I THINK THE 

1618
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,262
DEPARTMENT OUGHT TO LOOK INTO 

1619
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:45,796
THIS. 

1620
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,764
THEY STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO 

1621
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,900
THE HEART OF THAT QUESTION AND 

1622
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,801
THIS COULD BE A MIST 

1623
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,969
OPPORTUNITY BY THE DEPARTMENT 

1624
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:52,269
OF JUSTICE. 

1625
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,704
INSTEAD OF COMING OUT TO SAY, 

1626
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,072
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE DO IS 

1627
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,908
INVESTIGATE CRIMES AND WE DO 

1628
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,710
NOT SEE EXACTLY WHAT CRIME 

1629
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,379
WOULD BE INVESTIGATED HERE, THEY

1630
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,281
ISSUED A STATEMENT LAST WEEK 

1631
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,582
SAYING WE DO NOT DENY OR 

1632
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,851
CONFIRM THE EXISTENC OF ANY 

1633
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:08,251
INVESTIGATIONS. 

1634
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,486
>> SANDERS WAS ABLE TO POINT TO 

1635
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,621
WHAT SHE DESCRIBED AS GOOD NEWS 

1636
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:11,421
AND NORTH KOREAN NEGOTIATIONS. 

1637
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,189
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? 

1638
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:18,462
>> Reporter: SOME NEWS OUT OF 

1639
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:18,662
THAT. 

1640
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,130
SHE TOLD US THAT KIM JONG-UN 

1641
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:20,964
SENT A LETTER TO PRESIDENT 

1642
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:21,798
DONALD TRUMP AND IT WAS 

1643
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,233
RECEIVED AND IN THAT LETTER, 

1644
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:27,738
EXPRESSED POSITIVE MESSAGE 

1645
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,473
ABOUT A SECOND MEETING. 

1646
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,175
SHE SAID THEY ARE WORKING ON 

1647
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,611
NEGOTIATIONS TO BROKER A SECOND 

1648
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,245
MEETING. 

1649
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,480
OF COURSE, NO DETAILS ABOUT 

1650
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,583
WHERE IT MIGHT BE A. I ASKED HER

1651
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,718
WHY THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE 

1652
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,086
COMPLETELY SHIFTED HIS TONE AND 

1653
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,522
REVERTED BACK TO OPTIMISM SINCE 

1654
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:46,590
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO. 

1655
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,558
YOU REMEMBER HE CANCELED A TRIP 

1656
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,093
THAT SECRETARY POMPEO WAS 

1657
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,262
SUPPOSED TO MAKE TO NORTH KOREA 

1658
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,464
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS 

1659
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,566
FOURTH TRIP TO TALK ABOUT WHERE 

1660
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,467
PLANTS STAND FOR 

1661
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:57,867
DENUCLEARIZATION. 

1662
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:58,802
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, 

1663
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,404
HIMSELF, CITED A LACK OF 

1664
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,372
PROGRESS AND CANCELED THE TRIP. 

1665
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,107
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS 

1666
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,143
HAPPENED BETWEEN THEN AND NOW, 

1667
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,078
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. 

1668
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,747
KIM JONG-UN HAS SAID A LOT OF 

1669
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:11,548
REALLY NICE THINGS ABOUT 

1670
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,150
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HELD 

1671
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,519
A PARADE THAT DID NOT SHOWCASE 

1672
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,086
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 

1673
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,954
MISSILES, AS PREVIOUS PARADES 

1674
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:20,323
DID AND HE SENT A LETTER TO 

1675
00:49:20,323 --> 00:49:21,491
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THAT 

1676
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,993
INCLUDED THESE VERY NICE WORDS 

1677
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,027
AND POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT. 

1678
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:27,030
WHAT IS LACKING IS ANY SORT OF 

1679
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,733
CONCRETE PLAN OR ANY KIND OF 

1680
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,535
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT KIM JONG-UN 

1681
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,437
PLANS TO DO TO TAKE THAT STEP 

1682
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:34,838
TOWARD DENUCLEARIZATION. 

1683
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:35,739
APPARENTLY, THOSE NICE WORDS 

1684
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,943
AND THE PARADE WAS ENOUGH TO 

1685
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,378
CHANGE HIS MIND AND CHANGE HIS 

1686
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:41,978
TONE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ON 

1687
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,714
TWITTER THAT HE IS VERY 

1688
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,616
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE THINGS 

1689
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:47,951
KIM HAS SAID AND DONE IN TERMS 

1690
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,952
OF THAT PARADE. 

1691
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:51,822
AGAIN, NO DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HE 

1692
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,291
PLANS TO DO TO GET RID OF HIS 

1693
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:54,691
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

1694
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,994
>> WE'VE SEEN THAT TONE GO BACK 

1695
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,094
AND FORTH SEVERAL TIMES. 

1696
00:49:58,094 --> 00:50:00,197
WEIJIA JIANG AT THE WHITE 

1697
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,932
