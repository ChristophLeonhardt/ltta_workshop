LET'S GET INTO MELANIA.
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
OH, WOW.
OKAY.
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL.
I
SWEAR.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THAT
WAS SO TERRIBLE.
LET'S GET ON
THIS.
THAT'S WHAT -
OH, GOD.
THERE'S SO MANY OTHER
JOKES TO MAKE ABOUT THIS STORY
THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF
THEM.
MELANIA TRUMP HATES
BULLIES NO MATTER HOW IRONIC
THAT MAY SOUND.
SHE SPOKE TO
THE UN ON WEDNESDAY OUTLINING
HER PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO
MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
FOLKS HEARD THIS PART OF HER
SPEECH, AND TOOK ISSUE
ABOUT HOW TONE THAT
THEY CAME OFF.
TAKE A LISTEN.
IT REMAINS OUR GENERATIONS OF
MORAL IMPERATIVE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT OUR
CHILDREN LEARN.
WE MUST TURN
OUR FOCUS RIGHT NOW TO THE
MESSAGE AND CONTENT THEY ARE
EXPOSED TO ON A DAILY BASIS
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, THE
BULLYING, EXPERIENCE ONLINE AND
IN PERSON, AND THE GROWING
GLOBAL EPIDEMIC OF DRUG
ADDICTION AND DRUG OVERDOSE.
SO YOU HEARD THAT.
SHE
THINKS BULLYING IS BAD AND WE
NEED TO WATCH WHAT KIND OF
EXAMPLE WE SET OVER SOCIAL
MEDIA.
THIS OF COURSE ON THE
HEELS OF LITERALLY YEARS OF HER
HUSBAND ABSOLUTELY BULLYING
PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
THE
LATEST OF WHICH WAS THIS TWEET,
THIS RETWEETED GIF OF HIM
HITTING A GOLF BALL AND HILLARY
CLINTON GETTING HIT BY IT.
IT LOOPS TWICE.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS SO
FUNNY.
AND, BY THE WAY, THE
TWEET ALSO HAD HASHTAG CROOKED
HILLARY.
SO LOOK, THAT WAS
THREE DAYS AGO, BUT YOU COULD
PICK 1000 EXAMPLES WHEN IT COMES
TO DONALD TRUMP, AND WELL BEFORE
HE BECAME PRESIDENT.
ROSIE
O'DONNELL IS A PIG, AND ON AND
ON.
IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN.
HE
ATTACKS EVERYBODY.
TO BE THERE TO HIM, HE IS
A DICK TO EVERYONE.
GOING AFTER A BEAUTY PAGEANT
CONTESTANT BECAUSE HE THINKS
THAT SHE HAS GAINED TOO MUCH
WEIGHT, YOU KNOW, MAKING FUN OF
A REPORTER WHO HAS A DISABILITY.
I MEAN, IT JUST GOES ON AND ON
AND ON.
I MEAN, THAT IS HIS MO.
THAT IS WHAT TRUMP DOES.
RIGHT.
HE CALLED HILLARY CLINTON
CROOKED HILLARY THROUGHOUT
THE CAMPAIGN.
HE CALLED TED CRUZ, LYIN' TED.
HE CALLED MARCO RUBIO, LITTLE
MARCO.
I CALLED HIM BOY.
OH, YOU CALLED HIM BOY.
WELL, THAT'S THE THING IS HIS
TACTIC IS ALWAYS UNEMOTIONAL
ATTACK ON SELF-ESTEEM.
THAT'S
WHAT IT IS.
HE WANTS TO HURT
YOUR SELF-ESTEEM, AND YES THESE
ARE BIG POLITICIANS WHO SHOULD
HAVE A HEALTHY SELF-ESTEEM.
BUT
IT'S THE EXAMPLE THAT MELANIA IS
TALKING ABOUT, IS SETTING AN
EXAMPLE, AND THAT EXAMPLE IS TO
GO AFTER PEOPLE WHERE THEY MAY
FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS AND THAT'S
WHAT BULLIES DO, AND YES, THERE
HE GOES AFTER POLITICIANS AND
YOU CAN COME BACK AT ME WITH
OKAY, THERE'S A BUNCH OF
POLITICIANS SO IT ISN'T
PUNCHING DOWN, BUT EVERY OTHER
EXAMPLE IS EXACTLY HIM PUNCHING
DOWN AND NOW THAT HE IS THE
PRESIDENT, MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THAT HE'S PUNCHING ARE DOWN.
ALMOST EVERYBODY,
RIGHT, BY DEFINITION.
HE'S THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
EXACTLY.
AND I GET THAT IT
COMES OFF AS INCREDIBLY IRONIC,
BUT LOOK, SHE HAS FIRST-HAND
EXPERIENCE OF WHAT IS LIKE TO BE
MARRIED TO A BULLY, SO MAYBE
THAT'S THE REASON WHY SHE CHOSE
THIS AS THE TOPIC THAT SHE
CHAMPIONS THROUGHOUT.
THAT'S A GREAT POINT.
AS YOU
KNOW WHAT?
SHE MIGHT HAVE MEANT
THIS AS A MESSAGE TO TRUMP AND
SHE THOUGHT, WELL, BECAUSE THIS
IS AN IMPORTANT SPEECH, FOX NEWS
MIGHT COVER IT SO TRUMPET
MIGHT FINALLY LISTEN TO ME.
MAYBE.
IT'S ONLY IRONIC IF SHE LOVES
HER HUSBAND.
RIGHT.
THAT'S TRUE.
IT DOESN'T REALLY APPEAR THAT
SHE DOES.
IF SHE THINKS HE'S A BULLY,
IT'S NOT IRONIC AT ALL.
ALSO AS I WATCH THAT, PART OF
ME REALLY FEELS FOR HER BECAUSE
SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BE THERE.
SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE THAT
SPEECH OR BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE.
I HAPPEN TO KNOW SOMEONE WHO
USED TO BE HER HAIRSTYLIST AND
HE HAD TOLD ME THAT SHE IS ONE
OF THESE PEOPLE THAT JUST WANTS
TO BE AS PRIVATE AS POSSIBLE SO
NOW SHE IS FORCED TO BE IN THE
PUBLIC EYE WHEN ALL SHE WANTED
WAS A SUGAR DADDY.
YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN?
IT KIND OF SUCKS.
NOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE
SPEECHES THAT YOU PROBABLY
DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT.
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK SHE IS DOING THIS
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT HERSELF
FOR HER SON, THE YOUNGER TRUMP
KID TO BE BULLIED AND THAT'S
SUPER
UNDERSTANDABLE AND SHE GETS, BUT
THE KID ASIDE, EVERYBODY AGREES,
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE KID.
FOR
HER, I DON'T KNOW, YOU WANTED TO
MARRY DONALD TRUMP AND YOU
THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA.
SAD DAY FOR YOU.
THERE I DON'T
HAVE MUCH SYMPATHY.
I AM NOT
SAYING GO BULLY HER.
I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO
BULLY HER, BUT IF YOU ARE GOING
TO GET CRITICIZED FOR BEING ON
TEAM TRUMP, THAT IS NOT
REALLY BULLYING.
THAT IS JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF
YOUR DECISIONS.
