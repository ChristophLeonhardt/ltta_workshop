ITS ABOUT TIME.

101
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,429
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS JUST

102
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:32,739
FALLEN TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN

103
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,806
MORE THAN 50 YEARS.

104
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,174
MANUFACTURING CONFIDENCE JUST

105
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,643

THINK WHAT THAT MATTERS.

108
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:45,684
THINK WHAT THAT IS.

109
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:46,252
CONFIDENCE.

110
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:46,552

00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,089
CONFIDENCE.

113
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,191
THINK OF IT.

114
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:59,565
IF YOU REMEMBER THE PREVIOUS

115
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,199

116
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,807

118
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:12,678
RIGHT?

119
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:17,917
BUT REMEMBER THEY SAID AN --

120
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,452
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE GONE,

121
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,319
THEY ARE DEAD.

122
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,955
WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK.

123
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:27,994
I GUESS WE HAVE THE MAGIC WAND.

124
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,429
THEY ARE COMING BACK.

125
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,731
AND THEY ARE COMING BACK FROM

126
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,198

127
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,966
THEY ARE COMING BACK FROM

THEY ARE COMING BACK FROM

130
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,936
EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT

131
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,604
TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS.

132
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,940
THEY ALL WANT TO BE IN THE USA.

133
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,077
THAT IS WHERE WE WANT TO INTO.

134
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:46,245
THAT IS WHERE THE JOBS ARE.

135
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:50,683
WE ARE NOW HOTTEST COUNTRY

136
00:05:50,683 --> 00:06:08,201
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

137
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:21,547
WAY I WISH THE CAMERAS WOULD GET

138
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,083
THIS CROWD.

139
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:29,155
THIS CROWD IS INCREDIBLE.

140
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,823
LOOK AT THE CAMERAS BACK.

141
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:36,796

00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:38,430
EVERY NIGHT?

145
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,634
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE TO DO

00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,238
THIS EVERY NIGHT AND ONE LITTLE

00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,438
MISTAKE -- ONE LITTLE MISTAKE

148
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:52,211
AND THEY TRY TO DESTROY YOUR

149
00:06:52,211 --> 00:07:00,653
ENTIRE CAREER.

150
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,220

00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,123
OF IT.

154
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:08,060
LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THE MEDIA

SAY DID HE SAY -- DID HE SAY

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,051
THIS OR THAT OR THIS?

162
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:32,351
THAT'S OKAY.

163
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,785
YOU KNOW WHAT?

164
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,187
WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO LIVE WITH

165
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,055
THEM.

166
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,491
WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO LIVE WITH

167
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,559
THEM.

168
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,863
WE DON'T LIKE IT BUT WE HAVE

169
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:44,130
LEARNED.

170
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,933

ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE

174
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,212
MOST PROUD OF -- STEEL WAS DEAD.

175
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:00,780
STEEL WAS DEAD.

176
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,381
I CAME INTO THE OFFICE, STEEL

177
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,348
WAS A DEAD BUSINESS.

178
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,284
NOW THEY ARE OPENING UP PLANTS,

179
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:05,885

00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,403
YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS.

188
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,272
AFTER THE INDUSTRY DIES, WOULD

189
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,673
HAVE DIED WITHIN TWO YEARS,

190
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,909
AFTER IT DIES THEY WOULD COME IN

191
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:30,810

192
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,477

00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,889
WE COULD HAVE TWO, THREE, MAYBE

283
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,558
EVEN FOUR MORE CHOICES AND WE

284
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,796

285
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,932

00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,299
GO OUT AND VOTE.

287
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,634
NOVEMBER 6TH.

288
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,804
FROM THE MOMENT BRETT KAVANAUGH

289
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,572
WAS ANNOUNCED, AN ANGRY DEMOCRAT

290
00:12:53,572 --> 00:13:02,381
MOB WAS ON A MISSION TO RESIST

291
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,116
OBSTRUCT, DELAY, DEMOLISH AND

292
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:04,416

293
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,320
AND BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW -- YOU

294
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,553
SAW IT.

295
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,724
BEFORE THEY KNEW HIS NAME, THEY

296
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,792
WERE SAYING HORRIBLE THINGS.

297
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,460
THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO WAS

298
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,727
GOING TO BE THE PICK.

299
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:16,161
HE WASN'T PICKED.

300
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:19,532
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO

301
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:26,272
BE THE PICK AND THEY WERE SAYING

302
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,539
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THINGS.

303
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:28,273
THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE.

304
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:32,845
WE CAN'T -- LET THIS HAPPEN TO

305
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,145
OUR COUNTRY.

306
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,547
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN THE RULE

307
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,114
OF LAW.

308
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:39,885
NOT THE RULE OF THE MOB.

309
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,385
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

310
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:44,857
ITS A MOB.

311
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:51,297
THE PEOPLE OF OHIO CAN SAVE

00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,333

316
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,375
YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE?

317
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,111
WE HAVE TO ELECT A REPUBLICAN

318
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,180
HOUSE AND A REPUBLICAN SENATE.

319
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,182

00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,210
I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU THIS, BUT I

334
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,549
USED TO TRAVEL A LOT TO

335
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:43,949
KENTUCKY.

336
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,218
DOES ANYBODY TRAVEL TO KENTUCKY?

337
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:48,587
NO, I DID.

338
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,054
I LIKE KENTUCKY.

339
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,587
I TRAVELED TO KENTUCKY.

340
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:53,325
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE

341
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:58,497
QUEEN CITY.

342
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,733
I LOVE THE QUEEN CITY.

343
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,836
IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.

344
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,937
IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE.

345
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,339
I DID IT WITH MY FATHER.

346
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,074
ONE OF MY EARLIEST THINGS I HAVE

347
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:09,274
DONE.

348
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,442
I GUESS IT SORT OF LIKE IS

349
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,210
LIKE -- IF YOU GET YOUR FIRST UP

350
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,512
AS A HIT YOU ARE A HITTER.

351
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:20,953
YOU HIT -- YOU SINK THE 10 FOOT

352
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,087
PUTT ON THE FIRST HOLE.

353
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,158
THEN THEY SAID -- REMEMBER FOR

354
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,760
MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION, YOU

355
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,267
CANNOT WIN WITHOUT GETTING THE

356
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:35,734
GREAT STATE OF OHIO.

357
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,101
RIGHT?

358
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,305

00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:46,845

362
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:47,312
WE GOT IT.

363
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:47,846
WE GOT IT.

364
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,315
REMEMBER THEY USED TO SAY THAT

365
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:54,053
EVERY TIME I USED TO HEAR IT, I

366
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,256
HAVE FANTASTIC PEOPLE IN OHIO

367
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,391
THAT DID A JOB FOR ME.

368
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,192
BOB, WHERE IS BOB?

369
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,362
I HAD JUST A GREAT GROUP OF

370
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:03,595
PEOPLE.

371
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,597
THEY DID INCREDIBLE WORK BUT

372
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,400
THEY CONSTANTLY WOULD SAY ON

373
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,102
THESE PHONY NETWORKS, YOU CANNOT

374
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,671
WIN UNLESS YOU WIN THE GREAT

375
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,271
STATE OF OHIO.

376
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:16,108
THEN THEY STARTED DOING POLLS

377
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:16,774
AND I WAS WAY UP.

378
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:24,083
I THINK WE WON IT BY NINE OR TEN

379
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,316
POINTS.

380
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,518
WE WON IT BY A LOT.

381
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,187
IN FACT YOU KNOW ITS CLOSE THEY

382
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:32,157

LET ME TELL YOU HE DID SUCH A

522
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,751
BAD JOB AT THE AGENCY THAT HE

523
00:21:59,751 --> 00:21:59,917
RAN.

524
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:00,284

526
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:04,890
THINK HE ENJOYED IT.

527
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,193
NO, REALLY, I REALLY BELIEVE HE

528
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:08,493
ENJOYED IT.

529
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,929

531
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,097
THEY WEREN'T LOANING MONEY TO

532
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:18,569
THE PEOPLE THEY WERE SUPPOSED

533
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:18,736
TO.

534
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,172
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

535
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,908
HE SPENT $250 MILLION FEDERAL

536
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,777
DOLLARS TRYING TO RENOVATE A

537
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,346
HEADQUARTERS, HIS AGENCY, THAT

538
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,481
THEY DIDN'T EVEN OWN MORE THAN

539
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,517
TWICE WHAT THE ENTIRE BUILDING

540
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:32,918
WAS WORTH.

541
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,851
THEY DIDN'T OWN IT.

542
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:38,422
THEN IT BECAME A BIG SCANDAL.

543
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:39,825
BECAUSE HE WAS A DEMOCRAT THE

544
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:44,096

MILLION ON SOME ELEVATORS, IT

548
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,472

549
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:53,772

550
00:22:53,772 --> 00:23:00,112

I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET HIM OUT.

573
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,455
HE TRIED SO HARD.

574
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,490
HE HAD ONE OF THESE DEALS YOU

575
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,862
COULDN'T GET HIM OUT BUT WE

576
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:51,363

SINCE THEY HAVE GOT HIM OUT.

579
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:56,901
HE WAS BAD.

580
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:00,171
YOU DON'T NEED HIM IN OHIO.

581
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:02,374

582
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,777

OHIO SENATOR BROWN.

642

HE'S FOUGHT YOU EVERY TURN

643
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,611
VOTING AGAINST THE TAX BILL.

00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:59,217

YOU ASK FOR HELP, AND THAT IS

648
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:08,259
WHY I JUMPED IN THIS RACE SEVEN

EVERYONE HERE IS HERE TO HELP.

653
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,271
BROWN VOTES 96% OF THE TIME WITH

654
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:27,078
SCHUMER AND 94% OF THE TIME WITH

655
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:27,478
ELIZABETH WARREN.

656
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:35,220
YET HE VOTED 100% OF THE TIME

657
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,426
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S JUDGE

658
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,229
APPOINTEES.

659
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:44,863
HE SUPPORTED HILLARY CLINTON FOR

660
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:53,972
PRESIDENT.

661
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:58,743
AND -- AND EVEN THOUGH --

662
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:02,447
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE RIPPING

663
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:06,084
UP THOSE TRADE AGREEMENTS, THAT

664
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,118
AREN'T WORKING FOR OHIO, SENATOR

665
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,021
BROWN HAD THE GAL JUST A MONTH

666
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,590
AGO TO SAY THE ONLY THING

667
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,792
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR

668
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,927
TRADE POLICY IS RUN HIS MONTH

669
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,429
AND LINE HIS POCKETS.

670
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,499
THAT'S THE TYPE OF GUY WHO IS

671
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,602
NOT HELPING THIS PRESIDENT.

672
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,271
SHERRY BROWN IS THE FOURTH

673
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,139
MOST LIBERAL SENATOR IN THE

674
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:28,372
COUNTRY.

675
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:29,974
THAT IS NOT OHIO.

676
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,878
THAT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE

677
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,412
AVERAGE AMERICAN.

678
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,214
HE VOTES LIKE A HOLLYWOOD

679
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,085
LIBERAL AND HE'S RECEIVED THE

680
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,452
MOST LOBBYIST MONEY IN THE

681
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:42,187
SENATE.

682
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:47,992
MORE THAN ANY OTHER SENATOR HE

683
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:48,592
HAS RECEIVED THE MOST LOBBYIST

684
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:51,529
DOLLARS.

685
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:58,102
LOOK, ITS TIME WE SEND

686
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:58,736

00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:04,241
AND ITS TIME WE SEND ME TO

688
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:07,112

SOMEONE THAT'S WILLING TO

00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,391
HELP THIS PRESIDENT.

691
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,762
IN 25 DAYS -- IN -- IN 25 DAYS,

692
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:32,203
IN JUST 25 DAYS, WE NEED TO

RETIRE BROWN.

694
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,605
WE NEED A RED WAVE.

695
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,673
WE NEED A RED WAVE NOT ONLY A

696
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,844
RED WAVE AND I SAID THIS EARLIER

697
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:45,383
MR. PRESIDENT, OHIO IS GOING TO

698
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:45,950
DELIVER A RED TSUNAMI.

699
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,819
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE

00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,420

OHIO.

00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:56,461
THANK YOU.

704
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:01,866
>> THANK YOU.

705
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:02,500
THANKS, JIM.

706
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,202
IT IS TRUE.

707
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,004
BROWN IS NEVER VOTING FOR US.

708
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,272
HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR ANYTHING THAT

709
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:08,506
WE WANT.

710
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,509
YET I HEAR HE GOES AROUND -- HE

711
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,042
DOES THE BEST COMMERCIALS.

712
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,479
IN FACT I SORT OF THINK IS HE A

713
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:14,846
REPUBLICAN?

714
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,447
HE IS DOING THOSE COMMERCIALS

715
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,283
THAT HE LIKES DONALD TRUMP.

716
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,250
HE WILL NEVER VOTE FOR US.

717
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,255
HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR JUSTICE

718
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:24,822
KAVANAUGH.

719
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,090
HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR TAX CUTS.

720
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,424
HE DOESN'T VOTE FOR US.

721
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:30,561
IT MIGHT BE NICE FOR HIM TO SAY

722
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:31,395
HE AGREES WITH MY ECONOMIC

723
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:34,032
POLICY BUT HE'S NEVER GOING TO

724
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:39,803
VOTE FOR IT.

725
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,005
YOU ARE JUST KIDDING YOURSELF.

726
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:48,112
HE VOTED YES ON AMNESTY FOR

727
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,314
ILLEGAL ALIENS.

728
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:52,216
WE STARTED BUILDING THE WALL AND

729
00:30:52,216 --> 00:31:00,191
WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS BUT HE

730
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:12,003
VOTED AGAINST IT.

731
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,372
SO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

732
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,742
TAKES AMERICAN LIVES, AMERICAN

733
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,310
JOBS AND AMERICAN TAX PAYER

734
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:19,577
DOLLARS.

735
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:26,050
A BORDER WALL WHICH IS MOVING

736
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,219
FASTER THAN ANYBODY WOULD

737
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,222
BELIEVE, IS TRULY A LIFE SAVING

738
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:36,394
BARRIER AGAINST DEADLY FLOODS OF

739
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,562
DRUGS, CRIMES, #134UGALLERS,

740
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,396
TRAFFICKERS, CARTELS, OUR BRAVE

741
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,166
BORDER AGENTS WANT A WALL.

742
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:42,967
THEY NEED A WALL.

743
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:43,468
ITS HAPPENING.

744
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,035
ITS MOVING.

745
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:49,140
WE HAVE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS.

746
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,644
WE WILL FINISH THE WALL.

747
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:56,147
IF YOU WANT MORE JOBS, AND

748
00:31:56,147 --> 00:32:02,053
LESS CRIME, IF YOU WANT TO STOP

749
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,089
SCHUMER FROM RUNNING THE

750
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,226

WE DO.

753
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:11,962
JIM IS A GOOD PERSON.

754
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:13,865
HE IS A GREAT GUY.

755
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:14,999
WE NEED HIS VOTE.

756
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,168
THEY SAY WE HAVE A MAJORITY BUT

757
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,102
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, THEY

758
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,905
CAN'T COME IN, WE DON'T HAVE A

759
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,305

ALSO AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION

817
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:07,605
IS MEDICARE.

818
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,207
DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR A

819
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,176
SOCIALIST TAKE OVER OF AMERICAN

820
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,744
HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD UTTERLY

821
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,847
DESTROY MEDICARE AND ROB OUR

822
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:20,384
SENIORS OF THE BENEFITS THEY

823
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,287
PAID INTO THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.

824
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,154
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT

825
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:25,723
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS

826
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:32,830
WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND THEY HAVE

827
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,964
PAID FOR IT.

828
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:36,200
AND THE DEMOCRATS WANT RADICAL

829
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,302
SOCIALISM AND THEY WANT OPEN

830
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,105
BORDERS WHERE EVERYBODY POURS

831
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:41,505
INTO OUR COUNTRY.

832
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:42,039
ITS WHAT THEY WANT.

833
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,776
I DON'T GET IT BUT THAT'S WHAT

834
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,679
THEY WANT.

835
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,613
DOES ANYBODY WANT THAT?

836
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:49,947
OPEN BORDERS.

837
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:55,453
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE DEMOCRAT

838
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,121
PARTY IS TO ABOLISH ICE.

839
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,222
THINK OF THAT.

840
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,758
I TELL YOU WHAT, THE INCREDIBLE

841
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,095
MEN AND WOMEN OF ICE ARE NOT

842
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:04,495
TREATED PROPERLY.

843
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,765
THEY ARE NOT TREATED PROPERLY.

844
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,801
THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

845
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,404
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TURN

846
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,673
AMERICA INTO A GIANT SANCTUARY

847
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,875
CITY FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS, MS 13

848
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,877
KILLERS AND ANYBODY ELSE THAT

849
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,879
WANTS TO COME IN.

850
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,115
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT.

851
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,950
WE ARE NOT GOING HAVE IT.

852
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,119
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY

853
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,725
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR

854
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,192
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS.

855
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:35,759
NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS.

856
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:39,764
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SAFETY

857
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,198
AND IS ABOUT PROSPERITY.

858
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,667
SINCE THE ELECTION, WHICH IS

859
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,235
INCREDIBLE, IF I WOULD HAVE SAID

THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT.

864
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,074
IF I WOULD HAVE SAID THIS, THE

865
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,610
FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE SAID HOW

866
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,213
DARE HE SAID THAT.

867
00:36:55,213 --> 00:37:00,084
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE

868
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,821
CREATED OVER 4.2 MILLION NEW

869
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,390
JOBS AND LIFTED OVER 4 MILLION

870
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:12,195
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS.

871
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:12,697
BIG DEAL.

872
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,965
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

873
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:22,206
WE HAVE ADDED NEARLY 600,000

874

875
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:24,875
MANUFACTURING JOBS.

876
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:25,376
RIGHT?

877
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,976
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT

878
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:32,183
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN

879
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:38,923
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

880
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,459
AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS

881
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,859
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER.

882
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:43,861
ITS LOWEST RATE EVER.

883
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,430
MY -- IT'S A BIG NUMBER, RIGHT?

884
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,932
HOW DO THEY BEAT THAT NUMBER?

885
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,467
HOW DOES ANYBODY BEAT THAT

886
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:49,700
NUMBER?

887
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,103
WE WILL HAVE THESE PEOPLE COME

888
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:58,576
IN FOR OVER 100 YEARS, THEY HAVE

889
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:58,742
HAVE

890
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:00,978
CLAIMED AND THEY HAVE LIED TO

891
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:01,378
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

892
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:02,346
REMEMBER MY STATEMENT, WHAT DO

893
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:02,980

NOW.

896
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:07,651
WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

897
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:11,288
WE ARE DOING GREAT AS A COUNTRY.

898
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:14,325
I'M SO PROUD -- I AM SO PROUD OF

899
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,861

SAFETY, OPPORTUNITY AND JUSTICE

903
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,803
FOR EVERYBODY.

904
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,304
FOR EVERYBODY.

00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:31,642
WE ARE ASKING AS AN EXAMPLE ALL

906
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,444

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,349
GET AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS.

910
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,184
GET AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS.

911
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,453
THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING.

912
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:44,621
THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING.

913
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:50,027
THINK OF IT, WE HAVE THE BEST

914
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,896
NUMBERS IN HISTORY ON EMPLOYMENT

915
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,764

00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:54,531
INCOME AND MANY OTHER THINGS.

917
00:38:54,531 --> 00:39:05,709
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET THE

918
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:06,176
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.

919
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:11,816
AND ITS TRUE, KANYE WEST, WHAT

920
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,217

921
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:13,851
YESTERDAY.

922
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,218
PRETTY AMAZING.

923
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,121
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WAS WITH

924
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:17,287

00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:23,127
A GUY YOU KNOW WELL, BIG JIM

926
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:23,494
BROWN.

927
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:23,727
BIG JIM.

928
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:26,263
WHAT DO YOU THINK BIG JIM WOULD

929
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:30,367
BE MAKING TODAY IN THE NFL?

930
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,569
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE, RIGHT?

931
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,502
UNSTOPPABLE JIM BROWN.

932
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:36,173
HE WAS A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER

933
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,043
AND AN EVEN GREATER MAN.

934
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:39,343
HE'S GREAT.

935
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,112
HISPANIC AMERICANS AND

936
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:43,080
ASIAN-AMERICANS LIKE WISE HAVE

937
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,484
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE

938
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:48,351
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

939
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:51,389
AND WOMEN UNEMPLOYMENT JUST FELL

940
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,024

941
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,759

I LET THE WOMEN DOWN.

947
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,172
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE DEMOCRAT

948
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:13,377
IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF WINNING,

949
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:13,577
RIGHT?

950
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,010

00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,290
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER, FOLKS.

955
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,526
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER WITH THE

956
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:36,200
INCREDIBLE BRAND NEW U.S.,

957
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,201

962
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,342
WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST

963
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:50,614
ACTION TO CRACK DOWN ON CHINA'S

964
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,918

00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:26,430
I ACTUALLY SAID THIS IS GOING TO

1050
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,865

NOT JUST LUCK, NOT A LOTTERY,

1140
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:00,010

1142
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:01,345
WHO IS HE?

1143
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,080
PICK HIM OUT OF A HAT.

1144
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,648

THINK OF IT, LOTTERY, PICK THEM

1151
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,798
I WONDER -- WHAT PEOPLE TO YOU

00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:22,665
THINK THESE COUNTRIES ARE

1153
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:22,899
PUTTING?

1154
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,335
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE PUTTING IN

1155
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:25,668
THEIR FINEST?

1156
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:26,135
I DON'T THINK SO.

1157
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:27,437
I DON'T THINK SO.

1158
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,171
SO WE ARE GOING TO END IT.

1159
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:33,210
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MERRITT

1160
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:33,543

1161
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,680
BRING THEM IN THROUGH MERRITT.

1162
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,617
WE ARE LIFTING MILLIONS OF

1163
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,220

1164
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,691
DEPENDANTS TO INDEPENDENTS AND

1165
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,158
POVERTY TO PROSPERITY.

1166
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:48,658

1167
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:51,795

1178
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,441

1180
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,512
FAKE NEWS, I WISH THEY WOULD

1181
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,549
TURN THE CAMERAS AND SHOW BEHIND

1182
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,650
THEM, SHOW OUTSIDE THESE WALLS.

1183
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,987
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OUT THERE.

1184
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,190

00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,658
LOOK.

1186
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,525
THEY NEVER TURNED THE CAMERAS.

1187
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,062
I GO HOME, I SAY TO MY WIFE, HOW

1188
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,063
DID THE CROWD LOOK?

1189
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,865
THEY ONLY SHOW YOUR FACE, THEY

1190
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,101
NEVER MOVE THE CAMERA.

1191
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:12,308
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE CAN TELL BY

1192
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:20,717
THE SOUND BECAUSE -- TRUE.

1193
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,619
SHE CAN TELL BY THE SOUND

1194
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,022
BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- IF YOU HAVE

1195
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:30,160

1198
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:40,871
BUT YOU CAN TELL BY THE SOUND

1199
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,472
BECAUSE 300 PEOPLE CANNOT MAKE

1200
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,741
THE SOUND OF THOUSANDS AND

1201
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:50,013
THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS

1202
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:56,420
LIKE WE HAVE.

1203
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,256
YOU CAN'T DO IT.

1204
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,657
SO EVEN THOUGH THEY REFUSED --

1205
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,425
NORMALLY I WOULD LIKE IT BUT I

1206
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:02,625
DON'T.

1207
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,594
THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE THE

1208
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:04,827
CAMERA.

1209
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:08,198
THE ONLY ONES THAT BECOME FAMOUS

1210
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,568
ARE ABOUT SIX PEOPLE RIGHT

1211
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:11,834
BEHIND ME.

1212
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:12,702
THEY DON'T HAVE THE BEST SEAT IN

1213
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:16,873
THE HOUSE BUT THEY WILL BECOME

1214
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,275
THE FAMOUS ONES.

1215
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,344
HONESTLY, YOU KNOW -- I KNOW

00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,045

SO WE HAD THE GREATEST MOVEMENT

1319
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,015
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

1320
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,348
WE REALLY DID.

1321
00:55:52,348 --> 00:56:00,123
THEY CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT

1322
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,025
NOBODY EVEN CHANGES.

1323
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:02,492
-- CHALLENGES.

1324
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:05,362
THE FAKE NEWS WILL HIT ME THE

1325
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,063
NEXT DAY TRUMP EXAGGERATED.

1326
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,031
ACTUALLY WE HAVE UNDER

1327
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,833
EXAGGERATED BECAUSE WE PRODUCED

1328
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:17,340
MORE THAN I EVER PROMISED DURING

1329
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:17,673
THE CAMPAIGN.

1330
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:17,873
MORE.

1331
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:20,243
BUT WE HAD THE GREATEST -- BUT

1332
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,644
LOOK AT THIS.

1333
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,812
LOOK AT THIS GROUP.

1334
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,047
WE HAD THE GREATEST AND WE

1335
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:30,887
NEVER -- BY THE WAY I HATE TO

1336
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:31,788
DISDISAPPOINT YOU BECAUSE WE

1337
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,057
WENT TO MISSISSIPPI, WE WENT TO

1338
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:34,890
NEVADA, EVERY PLACE, AND WE HAVE

1339
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,960
CROWDS WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

1340
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,495
PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF EVERY ARENA.

1341
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:44,501
THEY HAVE TO START BUILDING

1342
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,070
LARGER ARENAS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1343
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:47,270
RIGHT?

1344
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,204
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.

1345
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:51,374
I SAW THIS IN THE ELECTION.

1346
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,342
WE WOULD GO -- WE WENT TO

1347
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:54,043
MICHIGAN FINAL STUFF.

1348
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:59,082
I GO -- GOT THERE AT 11:00 IN

1349
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,550
THE MORNING.

1350
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,751
THERE WERE 32,000 PEOPLE.

1351
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:06,222
I SEE SOME PEOPLE THERE -- THEY

1352
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:06,522
WERE THERE.

1353
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:07,457
32,000 PEOPLE.

1354
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,425
I STARTED SPEAKING AT 1:00 IN

1355
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,292
THE MORNING.

1356
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,328
I GOT HOME AT 4:00 IN THE

1357
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:16,533
MORNING AND I SAID -- WE HAD

1358
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:16,766
32,000.

1359
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:22,038
CROOKED HILLARY HAD LIKE -- 500.

1360
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,173
I SAID -- WHY AREN'T WE GOING TO

1361
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:29,546
TWIN GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN AND

1362
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:34,250
GUESS -- WIN THE GREAT STATE OF

1363
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:34,750
MICHIGAN AND GUESS WHAT?

1364
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,385
WE DID.

1365
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:35,618
WE DID.

1366
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,221
AND IT HADN'T BEEN WON IN

1367
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,355
DECADES BY A REPUBLICAN.

1368
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,824
NOW THEY LIKE ME EVEN MORE.

1369
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:42,157
YOU KNOW WHY?

1370
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:46,262
CAUSE CAR COMPANIES ARE MOVING

1371
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,096
PLANTS BACK IN.

1372
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:52,035
AND JUST SO YOU DON'T FEEL TOO

1373
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,703
LONELY THEY ARE MOVING THE PLANT

1374
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,138
AS BACK INTO OHIO ALSO.

1375
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,072
A LOT OF THEM.

1376
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,942
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED

1377
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,277
BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER

1378
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,213
WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY.

1379
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:08,618
WE ARE RETURNING THE POWER BACK

1380
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:12,588
TO THE INCREDIBLE AMERICAN

1381
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:12,822
PEOPLE.

1382
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,792
OHIO IS THE STATE THAT GAVE

1383
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:23,700
US -- A GREAT PRESIDENT WHO

1384
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,567
HASN'T BEEN PROPERLY RECOGNIZED.

1385
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:24,767
OKAY.

1386
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:25,167
WILLIAM MCKINLEY.

1387
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:26,002
HE HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY

1388
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:26,302
RECOGNIZED.

1389
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,071
WHAT HE DID IN TERMS OF TRADE,

1390
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,773
IN TERMS OF WAR BUT THIS TERMS

1391
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:34,677
OF TRADE AND I HATE TO SAY IT IN

1392
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:39,916
TERMS OF BEING SMART IN TARIFFS.

1393
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:40,783
WILLIAM MCKINLEY HAS NOT BEEN

1394
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,886
PROPERLY RECOGNIZED BUT MAYBE

1395
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,888
SOME DAY HE WILL.

1396
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:49,392
IT ALSO GAVE YOU -- A GENERAL

1397
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:49,825
WHO WAS INCREDIBLE.

1398
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:54,464
HE DRANK A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.

1399
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,465
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT

1400
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:55,665
RIGHT.

1401
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:56,432
SO ROBERT E. LEE WAS A GREAT

1402
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:57,500
GENERAL.

1403
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,210
HE COULDN'T

1404
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:08,878
BEAT ROBERT E. LEE.

1405
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,246
HE WAS GOING CRAZY.

1406
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:14,116
ROBERT E. LEE WAS WINNING BATTLE

1407
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:14,717
AFTER BATTLE AFTER BATTLE.

1408
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,185
ABRAHAM LINCOLN CAME HOME AND

1409
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,321
SAID I CAN'T BEAT ROBERT E. LEE.

1410
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,622
HE HAD ALL OF THESE GENERALS.

1411
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,824
THEY LOOKED GREAT, THEY WERE THE

1412
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,560
TOP OF THEIR CLASS AT WEST

1413
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:24,760
POINT.

1414
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,496
THEY WERE THE GREATEST PEOPLE.

1415
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:27,730
THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM, THEY

1416
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,967
DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE TO WIN.

1417
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,136
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.

1418
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:36,372
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW AND ONE DAY

1419
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,876
IT WAS LOOKING REALLY BAD AND

1420
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,178
LINCOLN JUST SAID -- YOU --

1421
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,813
HARDLY KNEW HIS NAME.

1422
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:47,483
AND THEY SAID DON'T TAKE HIM.

1423
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,217
HE'S GOT A DRINKING PROBLEM.

1424
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,486
AND LINCOLN SAID I DON'T CARE

1425
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:56,192
WHAT PROBLEM HE HAS, YOU GUYS

1426
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,826
AREN'T WINNING.

1427
00:59:57,826 --> 01:00:00,463
AND HIS NAME WAS GRANT.

1428
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:04,000
GENERAL GRANT.

1429
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,736
AND HE WENT IN AND HE

1430
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:12,075
KNOCKED THE OUT OF EVERY

1431
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:12,241
WIN.

1432
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:15,311
AND YOU KNOW THIS STORY, THEY

1433
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:21,150
SAID TO LINCOLN, YOU CAN'T USE

1434
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:21,450
HIM ANYMORE.

1435
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,018
HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.

1436
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,020
AND LINCOLN SAID, I DON'T CARE

1437
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,254
IF HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC, FRANKLY

1438
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:29,659
GIVE ME SIX OR SEVEN MORE JUST

1439
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:29,926
LIKE HIM.

1440
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,394
HE STARTED TO WIN.

1441
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:32,195
GRANT REALLY DID.

1442
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,295
HE HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

1443
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:34,363
A SERIOUS DRINKING PROBLEM BUT

1444
01:00:34,363 --> 01:00:36,698
MANY WAS HE A GOOD GENERAL.

1445
01:00:36,698 --> 01:00:40,470
AND HE'S FINALLY BEING

1446
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,937
RECOGNIZED AS A GREAT GENERAL.

1447
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:43,406
BUT -- LINCOLN HAD -- ALMOST

1448
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:46,309
DEVELOP ADD PHOBIA CAUSE --

1449
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,077
DEVELOPED A PHOBIA CAUSE HE WAS

1450
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,946
HAVING A HARD TIME WITH A GREAT

1451
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,848
FIGHTER AND A GREAT GENERAL WITH

1452
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:55,184
ROBERT E. LEE BUT GRANT FIGURED

1453
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:59,355
IT OUT AND GRANT IS A GREAT

1454
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,723
GENERAL AND GRANT CAME FROM

1455
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,358
RIGHT HERE.

1456
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:08,197
OHIO IS THE STATE THAT GAVE US

1457
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,633
THE WRIGHT BROTHERS.

1458
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:14,303
IT GAVE US NEAL ARMSTRONG.

1459
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,639
HE'S THE MAN THAT PLANTED THE

1460
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:18,975
FLAG.

1461
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:24,547
THINK OF THAT, ON THE FACE OF

1462
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:25,815
THE MOON.

1463
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,216
A RELATIVE -- THAT'S NICE.

1464
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,851
THEY WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT NOT

1465
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,787
PLANTING A FLAG, RIGHT?

1466
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,455
YOU KNOW -- HE PLANTED THAT FLAG

1467
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:37,427
THAT AMERICAN FLAG RIGHT ON THE

1468
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,494
FACE OF THE MOON.

1469
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:44,567
IT WAS NO KNEELING, THERE WAS NO

1470
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:45,935
NOTHING.

1471
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:50,473
THERE WAS NO GAMES.

1472
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,075
THERE WAS NO GAMES.

1473
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:52,275
BOOM.

1474
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,711
BOOM, RIGHT?

1475
01:01:55,711 --> 01:01:56,044
RIGHT, FELLAS.

1476
01:01:56,044 --> 01:02:02,485
MY MILITARY GUYS UP HERE.

1477
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,854
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

1478
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:07,890
MY MILITARY FOLKS ALL OVER THIS

1479
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,627
ARENA AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE

1480
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,896
FACT THAT THE VA THOUSAND HAS

1481
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:14,229
CHOICES RIGHT?

1482
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:17,366
I SAID IT -- BUT YOU KNOW, I

1483
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,235
SKIP OVER IT FOR 44 YEARS I'VE

1484
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,471
BEEN TRYING TO GET CHOICE AND WE

1485
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:22,771
GOT IT DONE.

1486
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:24,106
THAT MEANS -- INSTEAD OF WAITING

1487
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:29,479
FOR TEN DAYS OR FIVE DAYS OR 202

1488
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:33,082
DAYS OR 33 DAYS, OR TWO MONTHS,

1489
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,818
OUR GREAT VETERANS, SOME OF THEM

1490
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:36,419
WOULD BE FINE.

1491
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,155
JUST NOT FEELING SO GOOD BY THE

1492
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:40,723
TIME THEY SAW THE DOCTOR.

1493
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,325
IT TOOK SO LONG.

1494
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:45,094
THEY WOULD HAVE A TERMINAL

1495
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:45,327
ILLNESS.

1496
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:46,195
THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS.

1497
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:50,032
AND I GOT DONE WHAT THEY HAVE

1498
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:56,205
BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR 44 YEARS I

1499
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:56,472
THINK.

1500
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:57,940
44 YEARS.

1501
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,043
NOW WHEN THEY HAVE TO WAIT --

1502
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,479
THEY GO OUT, THEY GET THE

1503
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,781
SERVICES OF A GOOD PRIVATE

1504
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,084
DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL AND THEY

1505
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:11,654
ARE ALL BETTER AND THAT'S NICE.

1506
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:14,190
44 YEARS.

1507
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,025
TOOK 44 YEARS TO GET THAT DONE.

1508
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,961
I'M JUST SAYING THAT CAUSE I SEE

1509
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,496
THESE GREAT MILITARY GUYS.

1510
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:25,334
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH APPRECIATED

1511
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:25,768
FELLAS, RIGHT?

1512
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:26,502
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

1513
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,137
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

1514
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,139
ITS MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY

1515
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:30,339
HAPPY.

1516
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,106
PROBABLY COST US LESS MONEY.

1517
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:35,978
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT IN THIS

1518
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:36,178
CASE.

1519
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:39,581
I CARE ABOUT TAKING CARE OF OUR

1520
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:40,082
VETERANS.

1521
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,018
ITS ABOUT TIME.

1522
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,420
GENERATIONS OF OHIO WORKERS FARM

1523
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,355
THE FIELDS, POURED THE

1524
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,456
INCREDIBLE STEEL, FOUGHT THE

1525
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:50,493
BATTLES THAT MADE AMERICA INTO

1526
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,761
THE MOST POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS

1527
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:54,730
NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE

1528
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:54,930
WORLD.

1529
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,833
WE LOST OUR WAY BUT NOW WE HAVE

1530
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,067
GAINED OUR WAY BACK AGAIN.

1531
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:04,173
BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER

1532
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:08,911
THAN EVER BEFORE.

1533
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:14,417
THAT ---ED THEY DID NOT SHED

1534
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:18,354
THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS SO

1535
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:22,725
WE COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE

1536
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:24,961
OTHERS TRIED TO ERASE THEIR

1537
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,163
LEGACY AND DESTROY OUR PROUD

1538
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:27,563
AMERICAN HERITAGE.

1539
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:28,030
WE DIDN'T DO THAT.

1540
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:32,201
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM AND

1541
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:32,935
OUR CHILDREN WE ARE GOING WORK,

1542
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:35,204
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT AND WE ARE

1543
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:35,805
GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN.

1544
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:44,279
THAT IS ALL WE ARE GOING TO DO

1545
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:44,981
IS WIN.

1546
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:48,718
WE WILL NOT BEND.

1547
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:49,151
WE WILL NOT BREAK.

1548
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,821
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN.

1549
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:54,523
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP.

1550
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:58,527

1554
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:15,845
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICANS AND OUR

01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:19,448
HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE AND

1556
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:19,648

WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY,

1558
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,290
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER

1559
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,426
GOD.

1560
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:37,133
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE

1561
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,200
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.

1562
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,639
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG

01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:01,023
THANK YOU.

1570
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:19,742
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1571
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,314
WE JUST

1572
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,215
HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP AT RALLY

1573
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:01,884
IN LEBANON, OHIO.

1574
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:03,853
HE IS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE

1575
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,453
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THERE.

1576
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,122
HE ALSO HAD LOTS OF NEGATIVE

1577
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,558
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE

1578
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:09,825
DEMOCRATS.

1579
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:10,325
CALLING THEM BAD PEOPLE.

1580
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:11,393
HE SAID I'VE BEEN GOING AROUND

1581
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:14,230
SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

1582
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:21,637
THE PARTY OF CRIME AND NO ONE

1583
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:21,971
CHALLENGES ME.

1584
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,973
NOT EVEN THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA.

1585
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:31,680
I'M GOING TO GO TO MAJOR

1586
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,214
GARRETT.

1587
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,481
MAJOR, THANKS FOR BEING WITH ME.

1588
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:34,884
IT SEEMS THE PRESIDENT IS

1589
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,487
DOUBLING DOWN ON -- AS AN ANGRY

1590
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,221
MOB, RADICAL MOB.

1591
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:43,492
IS THIS A STRATEGY THAT SEEMS TO

1592
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:43,792
BE WORKING?

1593
01:07:43,792 --> 01:07:48,164
>> WELL, LETS TALK ABOUT WHERE

1594
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:48,831
WE ARE.

1595
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:56,072
WE ARE IN LEBANON, OHIO.

1596
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,974
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?

1597
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:02,511
WARREN COUNTY IS ONE OF THE MOST

1598
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,446
RELIABLY REPUBLICAN COUNTIES IN

1599
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:06,182
THE STATE OF OHIO.

1600
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:10,319
I HAD TO LOOK IT UP.

1601
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,188
IN EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,

1602
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,023
SINCE 1872, BUT ONE WARREN

1603
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,660
COUNTY HAS VOTED FOR THE

1604
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,461
REPUBLICAN.

1605
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,629
ONE EXCEPTION, 1964 WHEN LYNDON

1606
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:21,763
JOHNSON WON LANDSLIDE VICTORY

1607
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:24,232
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

1608
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:25,934
WHY AM I POINTING THAT OUT?

1609
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:28,871
BECAUSE THE GEOGRAPHY TELLS US

1610
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,407
NOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS

1611
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:37,078
MESSAGE HE REFERRED IS HAVING TO

1612
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:38,913
BE TAKE ON THE REPUBLICAN

1613
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:43,018
STRONGHOLDS TO BUILD REPUBLICAN

1614
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:43,283
TURN OUT.

1615
01:08:43,283 --> 01:08:43,752
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

1616
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:45,654
WHEN I TRAVELLED WITH CANDIDATE

1617
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:49,291
TRUMP IN 2016 IN OHIO, WHICH HE

1618
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,727
WON HANDEDLY, WE DID NOT SPEND

1619
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,796
ANYTIME IN PLACES LIKE WARREN

1620
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:55,497
COUNTY.

1621
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:56,096
REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD WHERE.

1622
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:58,500
WHERE WERE WE?

1623
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,269
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE.

1624
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,438
DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS NEAR

1625
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,207
CLEVELAND, AKRON, AND THE LIKE.

1626
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:06,942
WHY IS ALL THIS IMPORTANT?

1627
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,310
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS BY

1628
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:13,549
BEING HERE IN WARREN COUNTY THAT

1629
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,417
REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM IS STILL

1630
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:15,649
LAGGING.

1631
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:17,786
HE'S DEVOTING TIME AND ENERGY IN

1632
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:20,488
A PLACE THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE

1633
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:23,959
FIRED UP AS A LONG STANDING

1634
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:24,727
REPUBLICAN COUNTY IN OHIO.

1635
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,929
BUT BECAUSE HE'S HERE THAT TELLS

1636
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,865
US EVERYBODY ITS NOT FIRED UP

1637
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:30,098
ENOUGH.

1638
01:09:30,098 --> 01:09:32,434
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO DEMOCRATIC

1639
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:37,339
STRONGHOLDS AS HE DID IN 2016 TO

1640
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,441
TAKE DEMOCRATIC VOTES AWAY FROM

1641
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:40,175
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.

1642
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:43,612
SITUATION HERE IN OHIO NOT

1643
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,381
REALLY FAVORABLE TO THE

1644
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,448

DEFINITE AF -- DEFINITELY HE

1671
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:39,201

OUT DRAWING NEGATIVE ATTENTION

1673
01:10:39,968 --> 01:10:40,402
TO THE MEDIA.

1674
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,906
WHAT IS THE RESPONSE YOU HAVE

1675
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,275

IMMEDIATE SAYING THE MEDIA

01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:59,321
DOESN'T GIVE A FAIR SHAKE, THAT

1680
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:03,959
IS -- THE ROUTINE OF THE SORT OF

1681
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,427
CONSTANT REPETITIVE MESSAGING AT

1682
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:05,760
TRUMP RALLIES.

1683
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,697
