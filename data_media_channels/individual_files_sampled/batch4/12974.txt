I hate to say it but summer is drawing to a close and that means we only have a few days left to panic over nothing and blame Donald Trump you see summer is that lovely time of year when government business comes to a halt and the news slows down so journalists finally have some time in which they can really dig deep into meaningless incidents in order to scare us and make us hate one another and then blame Trump remember remember the hole Trump is a Russian spy thing yeah neither do i but if you look back at some of your favorite family snapshots you may catch a picture of two or two of your liberal aunt Cecile watching CNN and muttering oh my god the Russians hacked our elections and even though I don't even know what that means and even though I if I took the time to do a little research I discover that nothing even remotely like that ever happened I'm in a total panic about it I'm sure that Donald Trump is in league with Vladimir Putin whoever he is and now our country's in thrall to Russia like Keith Olbermann says whoever he is hi yes panicking over Russia those with some days of summer fun weren't they there were demands that Trump should be impeached for some reason and serious-looking commentators claiming that even though nobody was hacked and none of the votes were affected we should all be very concerned because something something something and during all that panic over absolutely nothing the Justice Department got conned into appointing a special counsel who is sure to get to the bottom of who didn't hack anything and who exactly is responsible for the fact that the vote was accurate good times my friend good times it's too bad autumns on the way and they'll be real news taking place and we'll just be too busy to blame Trump for something that never happened which he wasn't involved in any way but who will ever forget our fond summer memories of Charlottesville when somehow the media gulled us into panicking over the fact that about 17 of the 323 million people in our country are white supremacists dirtbags who lure you in with tiki torches and then won't even serve you a poopoo platter I can't even remember how they got us to think that Nazis and fascists left is punching each other and killing people was somehow Donald Trump's fault but sure was a swell old time wasn't it I hate to think that come September we'll have to leave this sort of nonsensical fun behind and get back down to the business of reading and thinking about things that actually affect our lives as a nation but you know even though these lazy hazy crazy panicking crazies stupid empty meaningless crazy lazy days of summer will be over you can be sure that they'll still be stupid stuff to send us into a frenzy of hating one another and blaming Trump all you'll have to do is turn on CNN or read the New York Times and it will be just like summer never ended trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show well that was a Clavin this weekend for the ages it was apocalyptic like you know you know that things are bad when Trump's pardon of Joe Arpaio was like the second news story I mean this thing in Texas we are thinking about you guys in in Houston that the flooding it really is it's terrible terrible stuff and we're thinking about you and praying about praying for you and Michael Knowles will be here to join us that will join us to talk about Berkeley and that anti-violent they ante for now we're supposed to call them and Tifa it's a little bit classier when you're being a fascist beating people up with a stick Mort you know it's nicer to be called the anti Fah what does it ant is an Tifa instead of ante Fah because they're not anti far they're far so that I guess ante was better so Noel's will come on and

to the wagon and go to the post again all right you know there's no there's never too much we can say about a hurricane I mean the only thing is of course there's a lot of toxic masculinity out there of guys rescuing people and it's it's always the only thing to remember is you do see these pictures and I don't want to sentimentalize it but it is true these are people of all colors who are in trouble and they're people of all colors who are going out there to help them that's the real story that's actually happening day after day after day in America that is what America is Fox News said it takes what do you say takes a catastrophe to bring us back together no it doesn't it just takes turning off the news you know it's just turning off CNN and suddenly you realize we don't hate each other that is not what's going on you know which is a good reason I want to start with this video that was taken of James Madison Secretary of Defense he was touring some overseas bases talking to the military you know getting out there and greeting the guys and they I don't know exactly where this was he was in Jordan he was in Turkey was in a bunch of places but I've been to you know places like this I was in Afghanistan and places like this and the guys are out there and they are people same thing all different colors all different places different politics you know people always think that the military is conservative maybe it's more conservative than the population I don't know but the people I met you know Democrats Republicans they're all out there serving the country and and he gave them a talk about this about the difference between the collaboration and togetherness that you find in the military where you're working for a mission and our country which unemployment is non-existent racism let's face it institutional racism is gone racism in fact is nothing like what it used to be ever it's nothing close you know we're rich we're basically at peace even though we're fighting these small kind of imperial type Wars and Empire type Wars and the in the distance you know the country is actually okay and it's only it's only the people who were fighting with each other and he talks about this a little bit this is James Madison to the Troops I know you can all be going to ecology young people or you could be back on the block just grateful the only way the only way this great big experiment you call it you and I call America is going to survive so we got tough hombres like you and you remember some of your two young local walden but on 9/11 we racked up against an enemy that's not if he heard us he can scare us we don't freaking scare that's the bottom line yeah a lot here will fight alongside our friends and allies and we're going to keep right on fighting until they're sick of us leave us alone they're buying time you're a great example for our country right now it's you know I know it it's got problems that we won't we don't have in the military and you did you just hold the line might find them soldiers sailors airmen that hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it being friendly to one another you know that Americans owe to one another we're so doggone lucky to be Americans we got two powers power of inspiration you'll get the power of inspiration back you got the power of intimidation and that's you if someone wants to screw with our families and our country or our allies okay so thanks so much for beating out here right he's completely took me by surprise that's good keep the old guy like me guest and the owner is my thing back off is up very moving talking about the fact that they are holding the line while we get things together they're keeping the enemy at bay while we learn not to be enemies among ourselves and we're divided at every level I mean obviously the left and right are divided we're gonna bring on Noel's Michael Knowles from the Michael nul show to talk about that what's happening in Berkeley and the just the ferocious attempt of the far left us to shut down the right Knowles by the way we'll come on after we leave Facebook and YouTube so you will have to come over to the daily wire calm and listen to it if you want to watch the whole thing you subscribe it's a lousy ten bucks a month I mean come on said ten bucks a month you can watch the whole show and if you subscribe for the year it's a hundred bucks for the whole year and you get the leftist tears tumblr my friend come on it keeps your left the steers hot it keeps them cold it keeps them stocked because it refills automatically every time Donald Trump makes a speech so you'll want to do that but you know we're divided every level so this is the right and the left but then you know this Trump and basically the Republican Party are not so the Republican Party's divided between the Trump supporters and the people who are not so sure of Trump and even some who don't like it and you know there's all there's divisions in the administration where the abandoned people have been are being forced out and we don't really know like are these are the people who are remaining are they Democrats like Ivanka you know is that gonna be what the Trump administration morphs into so we saw all of this with the you know the pardon of Joe Arpaio went on and like I said this would be this would be the big story I mean this would be the screaming yelling story and RPO obviously the sheriff who was in Arizona who was very very tough on illegal immigrants and was stopping people if they looked like there were illegal immigrants and he was accused of racial profiling he was accused of brutality in his prisons he had a he had so many people he actually had a tenth prison at one point he dressed people up in pink wasn't that one of the things he did and and well here let's just listen he was on Hannity moments after his accusation the thing that was he was a big big Trump ally he supported Trump all the way still supports and supported Trump when he was doing that nonsense about the birtherism you know where was where was Obama born which I saw differently than everybody else everybody left to call that racist which I never I never thought it was racist I I thought that was two trolls fighting it was the Obama troll Obama was a great great troll he drove the right crazy I mean you have to give credit where credit is due Obama drove us crazy and he knew he was doing it and he knew how to do it and he knew how to set us off and Trump just called his bluff he went after him and said basically you've been trolling us by not showing us this thing I don't believe you I don't believe you're actually you're actually born in America never he said racist racist races which was the knee-jerk reaction to the left to any criticism of Barack Obama but I just thought it was troll versus troll remember Mad Magazine use of spy versus spy this was troll versus troll and Arpaio supported Trump in that craziness and here he is celebrating his his pardon it's great I love that president he supports law enforcement very humble if you recall two years ago I supported him and I said publicly recently pardon or no pardon I will be with it to the end and I'm going to have a news conference early next week and get to the bottom of this and show the abuse of the judicial system and politics I'm not going down without trying to defend myself to all those people that don't like what I've done so the hurricane forced a lot of this to second place but of course everybody who has any kind of political ambitions for the presidency next time out immediately rushed forward to either condemn or praise it Joe Biden who still is living under the delusion that some day somebody might be foolish enough to vote for him for president who's related to him wrote this big article how we're fighting over the soul of the country and this just shows what a racist Trump is Kasich Ohio the Ohio Governor John Kasich he is always out there thinking he's got he is another guy I mean I just stayed in those primaries forever because he just can't get over the daydream that somebody's gonna elect this guy president and he went out and attacked Trump for this pardon I actually have the power of pardoning in my state we do clemencies overtime but we make sure that people did proper restitution I wouldn't have done it this way it's not it is absolutely should be out of bounds for somebody to use that as some sort of a political wedge it appears as though that's what it what it was it's not the way I operate here with the power to be able to give people a second chance but the president has that power I don't agree with what he did it's not the way I operate I can't be anymore you know anymore loud and what I have to say than to tell you what I do because my actions reflect the way I feel so I'm gonna tell you what I think about this in a minute but I want to let all the different sides speak John McCain Jeff Flake the senators from Arizona they went after Trump to McCain said the president has the authority to make this pardon but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as mr. Ohio has shown no remorse for his actions just just to be clear he was ordered by a federal court to stop basically targeting Hispanic people I think that that would be the best way to say it he told them he was doing it but he didn't he continued his policies and they held him in contempt of court so Steve King a big big strong border advocate he went out and he attacked flake in McCain he struck back Congressman Steve King struck back against me flake in McCain well I would think I probably spent more time with you or a pyro than either one of them but you know there they have been essentially for open borders they don't want to see it our immigration laws of course they don't want to build a wall they don't want to secure the border they want amnesty they've been for amnesty for all of their political life and so you often see people take a position this consistent was what they hope gets accomplished with regard to their policies that they favor rather than an objective look and I just I just watched this political persecution take under the Obama administration and when they pulled the 287g program from Maricopa County at that time it was conclusive to me that it was that it was an effort to prohibit him from enforcing the law and they wanted to punish your pile because they wanted to Oakland border so what king says there's basically true that people you know ascribe qualities to these guys according to their belief system so if you believe in strong borders then you were going to think that Arpaio's of that a good guy if you believe in open borders like flake and McCain you're gonna believe he's a bad guy here's what I think I think I believe in in strong borders very much I still think he's a bad guy I think he beat people up I think people were mistreated in his prisons I think once a guy is in prison he is under control and you have no right to make his life hell even if you hate in my dressing people up humiliating them you know it's like that's I don't want to say it's unamerican I think it's inhuman I think it's wrong you know and I don't think that we have to celebrate that even as we fight for strong borders the problem is however the policy of the federal government toward our borders under Obama and even under george w bush was insane it was insane you cannot have open borders or if you're gonna have open borders make it a law we have no borders our borders are open anyone can come in you cannot say that it's illegal to come across our borders but if you do it welcome you know that that's that's nuts and the thing about this is this has never been a big issue for me I was never the guy who stood up and cheered when he said I'm gonna build when Trump said I'm gonna build a wall it's not the point he said it's a rule of law question once the rule of law collapses once the federal government says oh we we're not obeying the law we're not going to enforce the law then a guy like our payout naturally becomes a hero you know you think back remember Joe the Plumber Obama candidate Obama is out there and Joe the Plumber says what's with this you know spread the wealth socialism stuff basically and Obama embarrassed himself by revealing that in fact he was a socialist he was a proto socialist and the press went after the guy who asked the question it was insane it was horror it was just an abuse of the power of the press it's why the press has no credibility is why we hate them it's why watching Trump beat them up in Phoenix the other day was such a pleasure it's because they stink that badly that doesn't make Joe the Plumber a wise man that doesn't make him worth hiring to do commentary he was just a guy you know he had the right to say what he said I'm not saying he's a bad guy or a good guy I'm just saying to make him into some kind of icon because the press mistreated him is is what we're always doing we're always reacting we're always saying oh if they hate him he must be great oh if he agrees with us he must be great it's entirely possible for people to agree with us you know and for us to say like it's nuts not to enforce the border that's what a country is a country is its border and for the guy who enforces them to still be a bad guy I okay ooh I'm gonna break I'm gonna talk about the Sebastian gorko who was the other big story cuz he left the administration these things are just getting blown away by the hurricane but we'll talk about him in a minute but first I have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube and let me say before you go to those of you who do subscribe to The
