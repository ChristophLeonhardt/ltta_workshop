we know that Jena Haspel considered withdrawing what did you say to her Friday to convince her to stay in you know Jena is the best can't we possibly could find she's somebody who served 33 years in the CIA she's been station chief at four different locations some of those dangerous places across the globe there's nobody better we could find she's committed to this fight and she's looking forward to hearing what she knows about her own career as you just described so what did you say to her Friday that made her not want to withdraw her nomination you know she she was committed to being the nominee she her concern is I think has been expressed on your show earlier it's your lead and said that I think she doesn't know if the CIA wants to go through some of the same stories from ten years ago but I think there's no doubt administration's perspective that she is the best person we could possibly have in this role not just administration but for the agents serving inside the CIA but there was another concern that she apparently talked about which was that the White House wasn't totally backing her yeah I saw that in your story I think that was erroneous reporting I don't think there's been any concern about the White House support for her and she certainly hasn't expressed that in any way well I have to say NBC stands by our story we do believe that there is a concern on hospitals part that the White House even if you don't think it she feels it it wouldn't be the first time you're wrong don't worry about well then why did you summons her to the White House on Friday morning I think that as I said in my meetings with Gina she was 100% committed to to being the best nominee we could find what was the White House so concerned about that they called her in for this meeting I think that Gina's concern is to make sure that she represents the agency as best as possible so what was the White House is concerned White House is fully behind or you've heard the president say that you saw the president tweeted this morning and I think that that was reaffirmed throughout the weekend let me take it at a different tack then because our reporting and Carolyn's reporting over the post was that there was some concern coming from the hillside that was expressed to you that perhaps the vetting hadn't finished thorough as they would have wanted that is something that the White House has dealt with in the past as you know when it comes to other people who you put forward for positions it didn't make it through Ronnie Jackson's name has been invoked in this by hospital and by others so what was the problem was I feel people that were coming to you and saying we have an issue they were not they're not Hill people to raise concerns with me I think anytime you see what happened to Ronnie when you see somebody's character but smerch the way that it was with him then everybody is going to be naturally a little bit more concerned and say this is a really poisonous environment and is it something that the agency wants to have dragged through the mud again but again we think she's the best nominee we're glad she's moved forward you and Sarah Sanders went to Langley to talk to her on Friday John Kelly did not why not John Kelly was traveling with the president Friday so he was out of town he spoke did he say him answer that question but he spoke to her we were always very supportive of her speaking of Sarah Stanner she was tweeting about this she said in part of her tweet any Democrat who claims to support women's empowerment and our national security but opposes her nomination is a total hypocrite do you really think Dianne Feinstein is gonna take kindly to that it's ahead of her meeting today with Gina Haspel we hope we can earn Dianne Feinstein's support I mean I think we look at that play the women card in this why is Sanders doing that well I think there's plenty of people on the other side to play the women card I don't think that what makes Gina the best qualified is the fact that she's a female I do think it's worth noting historically that we've never had a female to run the CIA and I do think that we not had somebody been a career officer run the CIA in 52 years so those that combination of factors I think is more to add to her resume when you look at what critics argue some of the the cot with the concern about Haspel is that she was part of very controversial actions we've talked about the enhanced interrogation techniques back when she was in the site in Thailand they there are critics who say if President Trump were to order her to do something she's uncomfortable with she might do it she might move forward on how is she prepared to answer that question how do you respond to those critics I think that Gina Haspel has faced a lot of very challenging characters throughout her her tenure in the CIA I think she knows how to speak up but she feels like there's an order that she's been given that she views is unethical but I also don't think that that's gonna be a scenario that happens how I think she said that she's followed the law every time before that's what the that's what in various investigations found out including you had on your show last night Jeremy Bosch who was the lead Democrat counsel on the investigation who said that she was completely exonerated and so that's also why she has the support of many Democrats who were leading the CIA from Leon Panetta to John Brennan to Morell to Hayden a lot of critics of our administration clapper who are all supporting her as the best qualified candidate for the role he's been doing a lot of preparation for this is she prepared to answer questions in an open setting about some of the actions that she was involved in she'll do great on Wednesday no doubt about that how much is riding on this hearing I think a lots riding on high because she's somebody because the nature of her career is not a public figure so this would be the first introduction American people but when they see her and they see what she's devoted and given to our country and then in the and the work that she's done to make sure Americans are safe I think that people will be very encouraged to know that she's the best pick for today hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the
