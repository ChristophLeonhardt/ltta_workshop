over a hundred Russian spies pretending to be diplomats have been expelled from the United States and 24 other Western countries in response to belad amir putin's poisoning of a former spy and his daughter in Salsbury britain in an angry response to the expulsion putin said quote i didn't poison those people and anyone who says i did is going to get a dose of plutonium in their tea after all I am a murderous thug and so if anyone calls me a murderous thug I will murder them that's how the whole murderous thug thing works unquote Putin went on to say that as an independent sovereign nation Russia had the right to kill anyone it wanted media reaction to the expulsion was mixed the New York Times a former newspaper said Trump did the right thing by expelling the Russians but he should have also put his thumbs in his ears and waggled his fingers at Putin because presidential rhetoric matters CNN said Trump's tough line on Russia just proved Trump can't be trusted since everyone knows Trump is a Russian pawn and he's supposed to be nice to the Russians but now has betrayed them Don Lemon was not available for comment because he had crawled under his desk to retrieve a penny dropped and couldn't find his way out meanwhile stormy Daniels continues to have large breasts so let's get back to talking about her trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin

interview meanwhile we should talk about the freedom project Academy because if you have kids and if you have started to check out schools you know that schools are not what they used to be they weren't even what they used to be when they used to be that and even before that some of them weren't what they should have been but Amazo America schools you know you used to learn Stiga civics you shouldn't be taught why America believed what it believed why it was a great country why we had judeo-christian values classics all those things but they don't do it anymore so the freedom project Academy delivers a fully accredited judeo-christian classical online school for kindergarten through high school is an incredible interactive education where students attend live classes every day with teachers and fellow classmates from across the country freedom project Academy the FPA doesn't accept a penny of government funding which allows them to stay committed to teaching students how to think not what to think families can enroll Stu full-time or just start with a single class it's entirely up to you here's what you do go to freedom for school dot-com and request your free information packet from freedom project Academy enrollment ends in July but classes fill up fast go to freedom for school dot-com get a free information packet freedom for school calm and don't forget please to tell them that I sent you so they come they come back and then you can come back because I'll still be here there's one thing I really want to point out about these Russian explosions it's very cold war stuff that totally deserve completely the right thing to do they should do more of this stuff especially strangling the money that the oligarchs Putin's kind of pawns who he's made rich by giving them giving the riches of the country to these oligarchs he's made them wealthy but they don't wanna spend it in Russia because it's a crummy country so they come to Europe they come to America to spend their money we should also cut off that possibility limit their travel all those things but this is still a good thing to have done and it feels like real Cold War stuff but here's the thing it's not the Cold War why because Russia has no ideology Russia doesn't believe in anything Putin just wants his power back he just wants to be a big player on the world stage again and both George W Bush and Obama we're pushovers and so he's expanded his power even though all he's got is gasoline you know it's all he's got to support himself there's no he hasn't got big industries he hasn't got a creative country he's just got the gas somebody sit the other day it's a gas station with nuclear weapons and and this is what you know Putin is just trying to establish he's just trying to show that he can push anybody around because that's where his prestige comes from but the real question the thing that really got me is the fact in the old day see we could fight the russian ideology of communism or as Bernie Sanders would call it socialism we could fight it with an ideology of freedom we say we don't have an ism we just have freedom and liberty to talk things out and solve them among ourselves each person a free individual each person free from the state my question is Russia doesn't have its ideology anymore does America have its ideology when Donald Trump says America first is he talking about anything more than what Vladimir Putin is talking about let me read you two things that caught my eye yesterday because I really think this these are amazing little stories but they actually say something big you remember Barack Obama Barack arama that'll be so hard to remember now that his political legacy is drifted away like radioactive dust after a nuclear war but he was whatever his name was he was speaking at an engagement in Japan and he was asked about these idiot kids who are out on the street trying to take away our constitutional right to bear arms and he said you know if I could if I could organize effectively then you know quote I would create a hundred or a thousand or a million young Barack Obama's or Michelle Obama's or the next group of people who could take that baton in that relay race that his human progress a lot of our problems are caused by old men no offense men who are old well I do take offense and screw you you obnoxious blot of corruption no offense obnoxious blots who are corrupt but but here's the thing so the problem is the problem is everybody is not Barack Obama that's the problem and not only that there's actually news being distributed that Barack Obama doesn't agree with it's amazing listen to listen to him talk about this there's a viciousness to politics and a polarization the very sharp lines that are drawn that make it more difficult to government and some of them the reason for that is I think because of information it used to be that in the United States there were three television stations basically everybody watched the same thing everybody got their news from the same sources and so everybody had more or less a similar view of the world but today because of first cable television and then now the internet people have 500 channels to choose from and they are able to find the news that fits their views instead of fitting their views to the news see see if only we had a million little Barack Obama's Barack Obama could deliver the news to Barack Obama and then Barack Obama could share his opinion with Barack Obama and that would be the perfect world that's one thing one little story I wanted to point out and the other is from the BBC this headline here's the headline Oxford men guilty of sexual exploitation on a massive scale let's show the picture of the Oxford men here they are the Oxford men collied Hussein al edita Yousef c'mere Iqbal Ali Hussein rah rah mean Ahmed mone Monell Islam and Kamran Khan what are they teaching those Oxford men at the University one wonders what that's that's what the BBC feels connects these men is that they are all from Oxford you know they'd be I'm sure I'm surprised they show them in there you know they're bored mortarboard hats with their black gowns as they paraded into graduating from Oxford University so I want to put these two stories together Barack Obama represents a point of view now it's come to be known as globalism but I don't really like that term because the world is getting to be a global place we understand that that's not the question the question is are there going to be sovereign nations and what rules are is the globe going to follow it really is expert ism it's the idea that Barack Obama knows he used to say I wish I could just gather together with my experts and solve all the problems but I have to be responsible to these people these people who kept sending out news that disagrees with my news what we need is millions and millions of little Barack Obama's talking to other Barack Obama's doing Barack Obama things it's expert ISM its elite expert ISM that is the worldview that he represents and this worldview basically says to you your God doesn't exist men are not men and women are not women all these rights you heard about that's just a fiction that's just a convenient fiction you don't need a job well we'll give you money everything is fine your and you're really you don't have any free will anyway you just take these drugs and now you'll feel happier those are what the experts are telling you and so they can't understand why those aren't Oxford men and so they let millions of them sweep into Europe and they under what's the problem we have a you know we understand that this is a global world we all have to get along together so if I send in you know ten thousand Muslim men from Syria into a city of three thousand people what's the just Oxford men they're just from Oxford they're Oxford men it's all fine that is the world that the people answered with Donald Trump and other people who are far far to the right of Donald Trump in Europe that was the people's answer was Donald Trump and so what does that mean right they sent this they've sent this man here this Donald Trump and all we've heard since then is absolute rage right we heard Russia like I said yesterday we heard Russia and then Russia didn't work in fact it turned out that it was Obama who was corrupt well that's no good well here's stormy Daniels look look she has enormous breasts and she slept them she spanked I mean the reason the reason I love talking about stormy Daniels is because she spanked Donald Trump with a magazine with his face on it which seems to me a perfect symbol of Western culture it's more but it's anything anything to keep from hearing the voice of the people now we're gonna get back to this in a minute but first I have to talk about if you want to spread the word of the voice of the people you need stamps right because sometimes he got us then

Daniels thing and like I said most of the stormy Daniels thing I like because it's hilarious you know it's just it's just really funny but there's really there was a big big audience for the CNN thing and they're bragging about it like yes we got so far down in the dirt that people showed up to watch Anderson Cooper stand on his head in a pile of crap you know that's why people showed up like I tweeted out yesterday if stormy Daniels had done it naked twice as many people would have shown up and it still would have been trash okay but but you know on the right - they're saying oh this is it the Wall Street Journal had a an editorial today saying you know this is could be the beginning of the end you know this is just shows that he brings this misery on himself a lot of nevertrump errs are talking about this and and they're saying it's hypocritical of the right not to criticize Trump for sexual things when we've been yelling about that Clinton who was accused of rape Ted Kennedy who left his mistress to die in a sinking car Anthony Weiner who showed his pictures to underage girls somehow that's the same as this billionaire playboy being a billionaire playboy I don't think it is but still okay that they're very upset about our hypocrisy so while we're talking about hypocrisy I have to just show you I have to show you this and this is from our pals at News Buster's we love this site and they just two great montages first let's take CNN this was before this is before the 60 Minutes interview stormy Daniels sent out a tweet against Trump and this is the reaction of a sea panel talking about this pornstar who says she had an affair with the president before he was president so I think the president has met his match in stormy Daniels they're pretty similar they know how to use the media they're not afraid to do it she's got a she's got a new lawyer who's all about the publicity getting on television they're promoting this interview that she's doing on 60 minutes I think that this is one of the few stories in the Trump era that has actually stuck for several weeks now and in part because I think stormy Daniels and her lawyer have been very savvy in the way that they've kept this alive by offering these little bread crumbs it's a it's a political nightmare right now for the president potentially isn't it it absolutely is and we should just stop for a second if they what we're talking about we're talking about hush money paid to a pornographic actress we're talking about intimidation to try to prevent a pornographic actress from actually going out and talking about her relationship with the president we're talking about other women right now who are saying that actions were taken to prevent them from telling this story about their relationship with the president if this was any other president they would be gone they would be thrown out of the White House okay okay so here's a woman he says anybody any other president would be gone for a relationship he had with a porn star one-night stand he had a consensual relationship which she says was a consensual relationship before he became president now here is a montage of the news reaction when Bill Clinton who was president was exposed for having not only having an affair in the Oval Office but was accused of Paula Jones by Paula Jones of sexual harassment was accused by Kathleen Willey I think it's pronounced of chasing her around the Oval Office and grabbing at her it was accused of what by juanita Broderick of a brutal and bloody rape here is your news media at work covering those stories back in the day some sleazy woman with big hair I think she's a dubious witness I really do we've got an awful lot to talk about this week including the sexual harassment suit against the president course of that one's tough to figure out who's really being arrests am trying to hurt the president does she say that with a straight face why does anyone care what this woman has to say but is bottom line Sam is she not trying to capitalize on this ineffective - to profit from impugning the president I I have to profess complete confusion over this entire case why this is even a case if any man I don't care who he is invites me to a room and pulls his pants down and asked me to do something he's gonna have a decided lamp from that day on and I go on with my life I don't need to sue anyone it doesn't traumatize me I don't understand why this is even a case to begin with story doesn't deserve to be dignified by being broadcast and displayed what when I find it fascinating about this case is that we've sunk so low now that in a charge of this magnitude can be leveled against the present United States with next to no evidence no I think that's outrageous I was reading either in time or Newsweek that even the woman herself Juanita Broderick said she hoped that this thing went away this week even she was sickening about her story but well let's hope she gets away with that are we gonna look back on this time 100 years from now the way we look back on Salem we're reaching the point where we're gonna wind up with government by goody-goodies government with peeved by people who have done nothing in their life except walk the straight and narrow who have no creative thoughts we're gonna look back on this a hundred years from now and say we drove some of our best people out of politics Jill Klein is thinking now that was Dan Rather talking to Don Imus yeah I hope she gets her wish he goes away and I hope it all goes away when they're talking about the hypocrisy of the people maybe the people some of the people are hypocrites I never went after Bill Clinton for his sexual affair so I feel like I'm on solid ground but you know what I don't care whether the people who support Trump are hypocrites and I'll tell you why they're trying to tell you something they sent an admittedly flawed man like all of us are flawed men and women they sent a flawed man to the White House because they couldn't get your damned attention you million little Barack Obama's all talking to each other they couldn't get your attention you would not listen to them and now you know they say they especially pick on the evangelicals because the event Jellicle have traditionally been very anti you know sexual malfeasance and they have taken this out on political figures but and now they're not taking it out and yet and yet there is maybe there's some hypocrisy CNN interview a group of women I think in yeah evangelical women and asked them about this stormy Daniels interview a lot of them said well I don't believe her I believe her well I mean I believe they had sex like I said the guy wasn't a billionaire playboy if he didn't have sex with her he's gonna have to explain why to the board of the billionaire Playboy's club but I believe but but they also said some other things that I just it struck me is totally sensible and totally realistic and also a way of just trying to get you to hear what they wanted to say let's play a little bit of this the people we the people are ready to define the narrative and it's not about tawdry sexual peccadilloes in order for somebody to come forward you can be pushed by somebody else right and so I think the thing is is you're looking for a way to impeach my president that I worked very hard for I'm asking you about a stormy Daniels interview on 60 minutes period that's it and about that so-called hush money these women don't see Trump's fingerprints on it only his lawyer Michael Cohen's maybe he thought he was just doing a favor to try to quash some negativity even even though it didn't even happen just to get rid of the story that's not even true which would also follow suit that that non-disclosure was unsigned because Trump may not have known about it all worst case scenario if he slept with her whatever that's between him the Lord and his family that is not about the job he's doing and running our country in which he's doing an amazing job you know there is a narrative going along around among the elites on both the left and the right it goes like this the Enlightenment which is this vague phrase that they use they I don't even think they fully understand how the Enlightenment worked or how what a complex tapestry it was of ideas and thoughts and interactions and actions but they say the Enlightenment has led us it has been the rule of experts of scientists of brilliant minds we've given you longer life we've given you iPhones we've given you a better health more food more wealth everybody's richer every look how well we've done but you you ungrateful people you ungrateful human beings you have turned away and you want to go back and the word they keep using is tribalism you want to go back to your tribe you want to get away from this beautiful global world we made and go back to this whole nationalistic America first thing what is wrong with you what is wrong with you as I said at the beginning these people do not get it I mean depression is on the rise suicide is on the rise and what they keep telling us is everything you thought everything you cared about everything that gave your life meaning does not matter your God you know the Enlightenment took us away from God which by the way isn't true but never mind you know the Enlightenment took us away from God now we don't want to go back there you know we don't want to go back to nation-states what's wrong with you you know so all right so you're out of work but somebody in Kuala Lumpur now has a job so you know suck it up don't you know so take some opiates and you'll feel much better you don't exist anyway you're just a machine so if you put these chemicals in you'll feel so much better and you know when the people speak it is inarticulate because there's millions of us there's millions of us we we don't speak with one voice we can't speak clearly that is why we have spokesmen that's why people come out and speak for us we elect people to speak for us Trump is a like I said he's a flawed guy but he's telling he's the way the people are telling these elites these millions of millions of Barack Obama's he's telling them we want when we say out we want our country back we say we want the American way back we want all the logic that went into our freedoms all the logic that went into our humanity all the logic that went into our religion back because it was true it was right the you know the experts didn't make America America made way for the experts of the experts are living off the good of America and that's what the people want back you can attack Trump all you want and some of your attacks are gonna hit home because like I said he's a flawed guy but maybe maybe it would be a better idea to actually listen to what the people are trying to say actually start scratching your pointy little barack obama heads and start thinking about what they were trying to tell why are they rejecting this beautiful perfect world you made maybe because it's empty maybe because it's meaningless maybe because you're wrong maybe because your worldview is wrong all right we have got the wonderful wonderful she's really one of my favorite people even though I can't pronounce her name but we're nobody can I call her juju that's her nickname and I'm just crazy about her she's written a book called target Africa ideological neo colonialism in the 21st century we're gonna be talking about it but first I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over the daily wired.com subscribe and then ask questions in the mailbag I'll solve all your problems for a lousy 10 bucks what more do you want come on over all right obiano Jew kosha she is the author of target Africa ideological neo colonialism in the 21st century you should get the book it is really really powerful if you look on the back it has a blurb from me I almost never give anybody blurbs but but who Jew is an internationally acclaimed pro-life speaker and strategist as well as the founder and president of culture of life Africa which is dedicated to the promotion and defense of the African values of the sanctity of life beauty of marriage blessings of motherhood and the dignity of family life she is currently in the UK working at a hospital as a specialist biomedical scientist in hematology very accomplished and eloquent woman OB on who jus a kosher food you thank you so much for coming on I know you're traveling all over the country speaking about your new book target Africa you know I read this I guess in an advanced reading copy and the thing that really struck me about it is you are an act of for for life for the sacredness of life and also for a kind of conservative view of sexuality in human sexual relations but what really struck me about it is the way you put it in terms of neocolonialism you put this in terms of basically an imperialistic effort by the West to impose Western standards on Africa can you explain that a little bit why you see it that way yes sure so obviously anyone who would read the book target Africa would say oh this woman is so conservative maybe I would come across as a really as an equivalent of a really conservative Western person but really this point of view andrew is nothing other than the ordinary or standard level of conservatism we have as far as social issues are concerned in Africa you know sexual morality and and things like that so so I spoke about this from the point of view there's an African woman I was born and raised in Africa I was educated in Africa before I came to live in in the UK so and these are things that I not only that I heard growing up but I I learned from home from school from the general society and then just growing up and I'm trying to live out my life in Europe I have also come to the point where I've compared how my own background was or the community or the society or the country where I came from versus the the countries in the West but also just in writing the book I knew that it's not enough to say yeah this is what my mom taught me or this is what my grandmother believed or you know this is what the women I know believe I also have to go forward to find research and under you know this because you've read this I went ahead to find research to show really that the majority of the African populations have these views on these particular issues like like abortion for example so if if the Western countries that are dealing with African countries as far as 80s concerned as far as humanitarian held you know is concerned if they are coming to us and they're telling us not only are we coming to give you help but we want you to change your own views to leave your own values behind and adopt our values in order for us to be friends together in order in order for us to keep giving you money or keep giving you this aid that really and Andrew is ideological colonization as anybody would like to look at it and see they're basically pain pain aid and the price is you have to conform to this way of looking at things and they're selling abortion very hard one of the ways they do this is by what you call population alarmism describe what is that exactly so population animism you know is something similar to what summer smile Thursday do you know all elders I think it was like a century ago or even more recently professor Paul Ehrlich who is still very much alive and very much around who wrote population bump I think that's the name of his book so it's whereby people come in and and look at look at a country or a town or city and say oh gosh we are so overpopulated here by name by this time next year we are going to run out of water we will no longer be on the water you know we've heard these things and in terms of population they're doing it to the African countries they they come in and they said they tell us in the next 5 or 10 or 20 years Nigeria will be a 1 billion people population so they come in they sound the alarm but it's not enough for them to sound the alarm they don't have to push our own African leaders into this fear mode so they're trying to push contraception in every way possible they are trying to force people and honestly I'm not saying let people not just contraception you know you already know my views on that but I'm saying that when the government steps in and they are trying to get women who are so poor that they have they have no leverage against government the government can get women in the case of African countries they're getting women on contraceptives even almost without consent even without full full information so it's it's incredible and it's all medium back to the Western countries who come out they tell us that we are going to be overpopulated that Africa is going to be the highest population continent in the next you know by 2020 50 and so they have to do everything possible to help us to reduce our population it's a good thing about this to me is that they there have all this terror about population and Malthus says you say turned out to be wrong about everything they terrorized you about the population but at the same time they're kind of teaching young people to be more sexual is that fair to say precisely so they're telling us you're so overpopulated but what what is you know what how does a human being get conceived these true sexual activity and then they go into African schools they go into primary schools Andrew and they're they giving our children condoms and it's not just giving them condoms they're coming in with condom campaigns that are so sexualized it's unbelievable they you know there was a program in Kenya that was called condom for kids right it does have an actual name that the government gave it but the Kenyans themselves call this program condom for kids now if you read the the fine prints of this project and the blueprints of the project you find out that it was paid for by Western donors right it wasn't it was rerun by the Kenyan government but it was actually paid for by someone else sitting in DC or sitting in London or you know sitting in in Paris they're paying for this project but then they're bringing condoms for children and they're saying that in Africa they are so keen on getting condoms to the children that even the size of the children then becomes a problem they say would they need it for like eight year old boy so obviously and they're trying to make accommodation for that it's it's very bizarre and I think there's quite a bit of perversion in there this is it's um it's it's something that that shouldn't shouldn't be allowed to slide people should wake up to it it's happening every day it's happening through agencies that we trust is happening through United Nations of all people so they're running these projects and they are running the Africans down and an oppression are seen in many many ways it's one of the stories you tell in in target Africa is you tell the story of the Ugandan ABC program and this story is always caught my eye because it was actually pretty effective wasn't it it was so Uganda had the one of the most drastic drops in in HIV infection if anyone didn't know about it but there was a point in time when I think up to thirty percent of the Ugandan adults we didn't I think within the age range of maybe 19 to 49 something like that were infected with hiv/aids and people were suggesting to the government let's do a massive condom campaign let's let's let's bring in condoms into every school every village and the the president at the time said no we're not going to do that first of all we will try what our tradition teaches us which is that if this is a disease that is coming through sexual contact or irresponsible sexual activities let us tell people and teach people about fidelity so if you have one one wife one hundred just to stick to one person don't you know polygamy is not good for you because we all so have polygamy problems in that of Africa then abstinence for young people they just strengthen them and give them a support system for children to know that they can actually abstain from from irresponsible sexual activities so they promoted this responsibility approach I would say throughout the country and within a space of ten years there was this drastic drop that has been that has remained like almost a mystery to swallow them who have taken hasn't had any success like that in South Africa they're drowning on the condoms they they have so much condoms boys brilliant villages and yet no one has had as much success as the Ugandan as far as HIV prevention is kind of destroyed it is it true that they destroyed that probe I mean was it was ABC because it was abstinence be faithful sort condoms now that now that program was taken apart wasn't it by Western forces it has been taken apart it I would say like during the Obama administration so starting from I think it was the end of 2008 beginning of 2000 and then of course when the presidency started so much you know money started going towards towards the Ugandan people through the USAID it's going in for condoms they are doing everything possible to undo what the President of Uganda at the time what he and his wife and his administration had set up in the country and at the time they had so many posters and billboards around the country that promoted abstinence that made it so so desirable for people to wait for marriage you know these kinds of things they had it also as of now right I went to Uganda I think it was in 2015 so President Obama was still president as I was coming from the airport heading towards Kampala I was coming from Entebbe there were these massive billboards of condoms you know and I thought who is paying for these billboards so I asked the driver to stop me to take a closer look at the billboards and of course it was being paid for by the United States government these are billboards in Kampala so the Americans may not even know realize that their tax dollars are being used to put billed words you know just around the continent of Africa billboards like these bill puts promoting condoms in places where people have actually not it really is a telling story because the if the purpose was to cut down on HIV infection ABC did that but they didn't but ABC and not sell the Western approach to sexuality or at least the left-wing sexuality and that was really what they're selling you know you talk about feminism which is really interesting to me because you talk very movingly about how you learned what a woman was by watching the women around you and you're obviously a very accomplished lady or a scientist working in in Britain and you have this you founded this organization for life what what is it about the kind of feminism that's coming into Africa that you don't like feminism is something that we have known in Africa I know people will not believe this but the the what do you call the women's movement the women's movement has flourished in Africa so what has the woman's movement been it's that many African women most African women rejoice in in what they call the sisterhood so ever since I was a child my mother was always the part of the women's association of teachers the women Association of you know whatever all women most women I know in fact belong to one woman women's group or the other so when you get into these women's groups even if it's a group that is of accomplished African women it doesn't matter they love men they love the men in their lives that's the difference between the African so important so even if it's like the Women's Association of Surgeons right or or of Nigerian surgeons so this is a group of women who was so accomplished in their professions but the one thing that big continue to acknowledge within those groups is that our husbands are important our sons are important the men in our lives are important even if it's the women association of female judges we believe that men are also very important in society and we believe so much in in male female complementarity and the role that men have to play within families we don't want fatherless homes we do even if the mother is a lawyer or a doctor or a judge we don't want fatherless children we don't want fatherless homes so the feminism that I learned growing up in Africa is I think it's that feminism which is firmly you know which is affirming of the woman's identity as as first of all as a human being who has dignity but also as a daughter as a mother and as a wife it's it's it's so important to the African woman motherhood is so important to the African woman the national identity the filial identity these are so important to us and then I'm in the second and third wave feminism coming coming at us from the West people like Gloria Steinem that particular ideology is being offered to African women as if with medicine feminism before so of course I'm writing about it in the book and showing that that's right and to get us to speak in their language became their own terms and it's an anti male movement it is very toxic it's very poisonous I've seen it happen in certain places in Africa where they find a handful of of women disgruntled women and then they if there's so much money they fund them these Western people fund these African women and try to use them as their entry point into the continent and it's very very offensive recently I think it was Justin Trudeau the Prime Minister of Canada Canada decided that he's going to put in some millions of dollars into what he's calling the feminists of feminism policy feminism friendly policy foreign policy so they're going to now be funding feminist groups in Africa and Families when they say feminists because they mean the feminist groups that reflect the Western feminist groups so in other words they are trying to plant within our own communities a kind of feminism which is very strange to us which is very which is also really really objectionable to us in many many ways I'm gonna run out of time but I want to ask you two questions I mean one just we just have to briefly talk about abortion this is something that you are a very big crusader against abortion is this something that this is something that's also being pushed with it the a that with the a that comes in from the West also comes in this this movement to abort right yes so abortion we've it's the most of the African countries don't have legal abortion so there's 50 for African countries out of 50 for four of them have legal abortion the other 50 countries don't have legal abortion or have all sorts of restrictions against abortion so we've also known that the people the the real leaders in different African countries who are pushing for legalization of abortion and not the African people but actually these are groups coming from the West who are trying to push for legalization of abortion so organizations like International Planned Parenthood Federation or the British organization Marie Stopes International so these organizations come in set up their clinics they say they're Family Planning clinics but we did a year or two the set of this around activism be judicial activism or any kind of activism and they're trying to get some supporters in at these African countries that will help them or push for legalization of abortion the problem is Andrew that for many years as well these same organizations irrespective of the fact that they are working against African laws and they're working against African people by virtue of fact that are pushing abortion they are being funded by Western governments again I'm sorry to belabor this point but the Obama and kept giving money conceal had continued ultra to give money to international Planned Parenthood Federation to Mary Stopes international these terrible organizations performing a that perform abortions even in some cases they had been caught illegal abortions in some parts of that trigger these I mean this is this was no secret at all came out in the papers several times in different countries so but the Obama administration continued to fund these organizations giving them money and then they're they're doing the their terrible work in Africa so I have fought against it thank God President Trump at the beginning of last year reinstated the Mexico City policy so we are grateful for that he reinstated it that meant that the United States government took away money from these organizations who continue to perform or promote abortions as international work so I'm very grateful for that and I'm hoping that the Americans will stand stronger and continue to support the Mexico City policy which is really about respecting other people's pro-life oh do I have to stop there unfortunately I could talk to you for another hour but it's a wonderful book very powerful book target Africa a really powerful point of view you're doing great work thank you very much for coming on thank you and I'll see you all right Oh be on ujju be osha target africa a really really powerful book and a very very impressive lady i think all right we've been talking i wanted to talk about a holy week this week this is the week leading up to the crucifixion and then resurrection of Jesus on Easter it starts with Palm Sunday when he went into Jerusalem and leads up as I say to the crucifixion and the resurrection and I just want to talk about some of the stuff I've been thinking about not so much keyed into maybe the days but just the ideas and one of the things I want to talk about is is the law the Jewish law this is a big subject around here at the forward publishing we have people on opposite ends of the spectrum people who believe that the law at the Jewish law no longer matters it's been completely fulfilled in Jesus and now nobody has to follow any of it and then people who believe that all of it is still in play and you basically are being grafted onto the Jewish religion through Jesus and you still have to play that out now I think the reason I think it's an important subject I know it sounds kind of like a technical theological subject but I think it's also really about rules in general and this is an important subject now Jordan Peterson has this big bestseller 12 rules for life and people are desperate to know what are the rules everything's broken down all the values are gone so what are the rules and the rules are part of an even bigger subject which is objective moral truth and how it works versus subjective life we have people on the Left who say the only thing that matters is my lived experience I lived experience and then we have people on the right who know they're so spirited to the rules they tell you you know you can't watch a game of Thrones or you won't go to heaven if you're watching Game of Thrones and then if you don't watch Game of Thrones you go to heaven and st. Peter says I'll let you in a minute but I got to finish watching Game of Thrones so people know the rules now I I admit and I think it's important to say this that I have an eccentric way of reading the Bible and make some of you angry and all I would say to you is this I occasionally take on your way of looking at reading the Bible to see what I can learn from that you can take on mine for a little bit you could still go back to reading if somebody said I'm one of my listeners wrote to me and he said you don't read the Bible literally literally but you read it literally and I hope that that is in fact the case and my way of looking at the Bible is one the Bible is in fact the book that God wants us to have about himself it I think it has proved that over the years by the incredible wisdom and way of life that has grown out of its perspective but - it's a book written by men right God an angel of the Lord could come down right now and stand by me and dictate into my ear still what came out of my mouth would be wrong I would still not get it perfectly right because when somebody speaks to you two things happens somebody speaks and somebody hears and you hear things not just it's not just that you hear things the way you want to you hear things in your own individual way they got they are filtered through your personal experience this is how poetry happens okay great poetry if John Keats describes a tree it's a unique tree but the tree is still objectively there we both see the tree but we both see a tree through our own eyes and that is the beauty of the world and the beauty of individual individualism and individuality is that the essence of the tree is objectively real but as it is filtered through our perspective it also becomes something more something beautiful something unique and it's important the inner life is important because that's what all the important stuff happens that's where you love your spouse that's where you know God that's where anything that strikes you as beautiful becomes beautiful it's not objectively beautiful it becomes beautiful and it's interaction with you but the essence of the thing remains objectively what it is so when God chose the Jews and spoke to them he spoke to them but they heard it as the Jews and the rules and laws that came out of that conversation are Jewish rules and Jewish laws even though they maintain the essence of the god word if God had chosen the Japanese first of all the Jews would be a lot happier but if he chosen the Japanese there would have been a Japanese set of rules so the essence of the law remains the same but the law itself remains particular to the Jews and when Jesus came he then basically gave this word of God which he embodied to the rest of the world and he explained the essence of the law and the essence of the law he said thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all my mind this is the first and Great Commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets and he demonstrated this for instance when he the woman taken in adultery was brought to him to be stoned and he said let him who is without sin through the for the first stone in other words the essence of the law remains the same the woman had done wrong but the way we live out the law can be different if it is seen through those two great commandments of love after Jesus was gone his key disciple Peter the guy he said he was going to build the church on had a vision and the vision went like this remember the Jews had very very complex and still have very complex ideas about what you could eat and what was right to eat and what was very wrong to eat most sinful to eat and Peter had a vision and the vision was he became hungry and wanted something to eat and he fell into a trance and he saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet was let down to earth by its four corners and it contained all kinds of four-footed animals as well as reptiles and birds and then a voice told told Peter get up Peter kill and eat and Peter said surely not Lord I have never eaten anything impure or unclean but this kept happening it kept happening into him again and again and he understood the vision when he was invited to go and talk to some Gentiles he said to them through this vision I realize now how true it is that God does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right and while Peter was still speaking those words the Holy Spirit descended the Gentiles which shocked the hell out of him he was it he said he said surely no one can stand in the way of the Gentiles being baptized with water they have received the Holy Spirit just as we we have you're looking for rules but the rules all hang on these two Commandments love God and love your neighbor because he was made in the image of God and if you haven't hung your life on those two rules and you haven't experienced the essence of the law all the Bible quotes in the world won't help you all the rules won't help you if you're not hanging it on those two rules I always say to people if if you come out somehow come out of the Bible hating somebody you should come out being somebody maybe you've taken a wrong turn at the whole love God love your neighbor thing okay that is my experience of the rules and I'll talk tomorrow I'll talk a little bit about God versus other Jesus versus other religions specifically Buddhism I think anyway we would be there then it's the mailbag get your questions in now I will answer them all answers guaranteed 100% correct will change your life for some of you for the better for the rest too bad I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin
