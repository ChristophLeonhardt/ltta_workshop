diversity and comics went on Jim Jeffries show on Comedy Central to talk about comics gate and it was a complete hack job I don't watch TV so I'm not too familiar with Jim Jefferies but apparently he is a far leftist and has a show on Comedy Central he went around San Diego comic-con and asked people questions about comics gates and he finds people that I believe are making valid point so at first I was excited about this but I believe he may have cut people out who were really articulate and explained the points properly and he just picked people that he thought looked ridiculous or redneck or white males I am used to be why do you say used to be I stopped reading it over the diversity issue overall they've been changing comic character characters a little too much there's a comic book tradition in a way how each character should look then he brings up that there is a movement led by a super villain which is of course Richard Meyer from diversity and comics when revealing his face he said yeah that checks out and I wonder exactly what does he mean by that yeah that checks out does he mean that he's a white male so of course he's against diversity in comics who is this evil mastermind whining complaining from the shadows everyone on the Internet is making fun of Richards haircut in this calling it super cuts but I think he looks just fine to me Meyers points out that comics are dying because of all the political correctness and identity politics they are putting in these comics and the industry is tanking because of it he points out the fact that miss Marvel is now a Pakistani Muslim and that the new Ironman is now a woman Jim Jefferies tries to set him up as being racist because of his viewpoints on this it would it would upset her racists I think it would after calling Richard Meyer a child he brings in a team of sjw's who are dressed up like it's Halloween who denied the fact that diversity in comics is killing the industry they say that it is completely false when there is plenty of proof to show that the comics industry is tanking and they are doing more and more inclusiveness which is pissing off the consumers he starts questioning the group and Richard Meyer about different characters and possible interpretations of them and you can tell that they edit it it's a hack job to make Richard Meyer look racist and I think Richard actually comes across kind of funny and in on the joke like I said how do you feel about black Sigmund okay a slightly less black Sigmund yeah no that's actually better Black Panthers villain kill manga but now he's played by a woman and the way that she attacks the black panther is by calling the cops while he's trying to barbecue Jefferies goes on to claim that Myers is attacking women and people of color who work in the comics industry Jefferies James Myers about his comments on some of the women in the industry you killed a woman and I'm stuck yeah it was a bad idea even if you don't believe that you're a racist or homophobic or sexist isn't a fear of yours that you were attracting some people who are I don't really think about stuff like that that much right seems like you might want to stop thinking about it Ritchie then the group of sjw's and Jeffries go on to call Meyers names as well and everyone has a laugh about it I mean look at the hypocrisy clearly they don't practice what they preach or is it just okay because he's a white male what do you think of Richard mine uh he's a garbage person you can say cut on this show wait the cop Bridget the characters you don't like aren't written for you you know what I think I like this better how he started they claimed that Richard is upset because when he reads comics he can't really see himself in any of the characters and claims that that's how minority groups have felt their entire life however I know many comic book characters that have been lesbian a Native American many different races genders and sexual orientations it has always reflected the proportions of society and now they want to reflect a disproportionate amount of minorities and comics people are criticizing him for going on the show wondering why he would do such a thing considering they would most likely make him look bad but I also think that it brought a larger scale of people to notice what's going on with comics gates and possibly these people agree with the movement and it draws more attention to it so you know what they say about PR and how press any press is good press so there's no such thing as bad publicity what do you guys think do you think Richard came off hilarious or did they make him look bad if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
