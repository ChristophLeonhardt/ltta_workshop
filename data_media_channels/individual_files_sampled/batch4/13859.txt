he didn't do any of these things that all of these women are either liars or misconstruing his actions it seems to me it's hard to misconstrue somebody grabbing your in the middle of a photo line but you know to each his own so Franken stepped down after the Democrats turned on him they turn on him in the last 48 hours really not because of the new reports about Franken but because they wish to throw Republicans under the Moral under the morale bus that was the goal here the pretext they used for throwing Franken out was this was this report from the Atlantic that said that Franken had sexually harassed a woman at a Media Matters party there's a woman named Tina deploy who wrote for the Atlantic she says it happened in a media matters party during the first Obama inauguration it was a great time to be a Democrat not only had we just elected the first african-american president of the United States but frankenz race had triggered a recount leaving leftist skiddy we would soon have a supermajority in the Senate as you recall Al Franken stole that Tennessee from Norm Coleman they just kept recounting the votes until enough felons were counted that Al Franken was the senator from Minnesota this woman writes this is my first inauguration I've never been in the proverbial room where it happens my experience with government at that point was being a ward of the court in foster care nothing that I had an interest in politics in politics and in grandstanding my foster dad set up an internship for me at the district office of Representative George Miller the summer before my senior year of high school as an intern I answered calls thumb through the congressional record etc she does I've been married for two years at the time I don't let my husband touch me like Al Franken did in public right here's what she says I saw Al Franken I only bug celebrities for pictures when it'll make my foster mom happy she loves Franken so I asked to get a picture with him he posted the shot he immediately put his hand on my waist grabbing a handful of flesh I froze then he squeezed at least twice what a class act that Al Franken so Franken gave a statement which he said all of this has been misconstrued he's totally innocent but he's leaving anyway and then he blabbered on for a while about activism and the wonders of activism and again he just kept calling them liers over and over and over hoping that he would have another shot at this that's what Al Franken is hoping al franken is hoping that he leaves in quote-unquote disgrace that he does his penance and then he comes back in a couple of years having cleansed himself of the stigma this in order to ensure that he immediately wheeled and hit Trump and and Roy Moore Roy Moore of course the Senate Alabama Republican candidate who's been credibly accused of child molestation now what's hilarious about all of this is watching the Democrats swing to push Franken out so just a couple of days ago we played the audio yesterday of kirsten gillibrand saying that she didn't know whether Franken should step down he should really make his own decision and then yesterday she actually said Franken should step down so if she changed her opinion kirsten gillibrand who's been treated as a possible 2020 candidate there is no better weather vane than kirsten gillibrand I mean there are no better weather vanes on planet earth than Kirsten Gillibrand the woman has her finger in the air at all times seen which way the wind is blowing she realized that she wanted the way she realized the limb is blowing against Franken so she stepped out in front of that and said Franken should resign is what she said yesterday well obviously there were new allegations today and enough is enough I mean this is a conversation we've been having for a very long time and it's a conversation that this country needs to have and I think when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual assault and sexual harassment and unwanted groping you are having the wrong conversation you need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK none of it is acceptable and we as elected leaders should absolutely be held to a higher standard not a lower standard that's a wild switch from Kirsten Gillibrand who five seconds ago was saying that basically Al Franken might stay but Roy Moore should go and president Trump's a sexual abuser but not Al Franken this is all this is all a wild shift I will say that the logic that's used here that we have to lump all of this activity together is a little bit disturbing to me I don't think that Harvey Weinstein should be lumped together with Al Franken and I don't think that Al Franken should be lumped together with like Clarence Thomas who apparently made a crude sexual remark to Anita - Anita Hill one time or was alleged to have done so the this does not seem to me that all of these things should be grouped together or posed equivalent threats to careers some of these activities are truly horrifying and your career should be ended you should end up in jail and some of these activities are bad you're a creep but I'm not sure that it rises to the level of the of the same outrage as a Harvey Weinstein for example in any case but this is really about for Democrats and we all know it what this is really about is seizing the moral high ground what Democrats truly want to do here is not push out Franken because they care about Franken not push out John Conyers because they care about John Conyers they want to push all these people out so that they can turn and swivel and hit Donald Trump and Roy more so senator mazie Hirono the Democrat of Hawaii she came out yesterday and she said you know now that Franken is going you know be really great as if Trump and more stepped aside and they say what Al Franken did was wrong but it's not even in the same ballpark why take this step and why not also be calling for president Trump and and Roy Moore to step aside well I would love it if both of them stepped aside because I've said publicly that the president Trump has admitted to being a sexual predator and as for Roy Moore the credible allegations of him being a child molester basically they should cause both of them to look at themselves and step down I would love it but at the same time you know I'm looking for where the Republican voices where is their outrage in fact on the opposite end they're coming forward to support one more how's that for totally inappropriate position so two things can be true once one Democrats can be right to shove these people out the door and Republicans should do the same with their own bad candidates and two this can be totally politically driven because it is totally politically driven I mean there's no question about it the fact is that the Democrats suffer zero repercussions for getting rid of Franken the Democratic governor of Minnesota Mark Dayton is about to appoint his lieutenant governor I can't her name escapes me for the moment but he's about to appoint her a Democrat she filled Franken seats the Democrats don't lose a seat in the Senate forcing out John Conyers means nothing because some relative of John Conyers will fill that seat it's very easy to take the moral high ground when it doesn't mean actually sacrificing anything anytime Democrats have to think about sacrificing something they rally around the flag of the sexual abuser the same way that Republicans are currently rallying around the flags of alleged sexual abusers so there's no question that there's a bunch of hypocrisy going on here and a bunch of political posturing Bernie Sanders another example he came out yesterday or this morning rather and he said that Donald Trump and Roy Moore should both step down because Al Franken is going earlier this week Bernie Sanders is literally running away from the cameras when he was asked about Al Franken so what's happened here is that the Democrats waited until the Republican National Committee and Trump Rhee endorsed more and they said here's our chance to draw a contrast now is that smart politics of course it's smart politics now they get to claim that they have the moral high ground and Republicans meanwhile are shoving the moral high ground away from them as fast as humanly possible I mean they're taking that moral high ground and they are running from it as fast as humanly possible so much so they are actually seeing Republicans now come out and start to defend Al Franken till last night on Laura Ingraham John Fox News Newt Gingrich was talking with Ingram and both Gingrich and Ingram were actually defending Al Franken because they understand what's happening next right here here's the logic well we're not gonna let Trump and more go until you get rid of Al Franken Democrats say fine we'll get rid of Al Franken then the repose it will hold on hold up a second maybe you don't want to get rid of Al Franken may that's a bad idea to get rid of Al Franken it's all political partisanship at its finest here's Gingrich with Ingram suddenly defending al Frank and a guy who routinely grabs women by the butt in the middle of photo lines apparently al franken was a comedian comedians often do weird things he was in the entertainment business he was doing the kind of things people in the entertainment business do now I have not maybe I'm wrong but I don't see anything that they've said he's done since he was a senator I don't think they said tried to lose track I think there are a couple allegations of inappropriate conduct I think it's minor so yeah but the point is we are wearing one of those weird American moments when running around lynching people seals if you go back anyway you go back and watch the YouTube of Clarence Thomas a was wonderful and sworn in Kalista oh great great moment and you know fellow Georgia and everything you go back and you look at what he said about an electronic lynching and then you look at what we're saying we had a lot of good reasons to retire but on the other hand no hearings no you're accused and you're a man you're a so here we are now right so here we got we've got Laura Ingraham and Newt Gingrich defending Al Franken you think they're doing that because they really like Al Franken or they think Al Franken ought to get a fair shake I mean they're both calling for the prosecution of Hillary Clinton based on less evidence than Al Franken here Hillary Clinton by the way should have gone to jail okay the idea that they are out defending Al Franken today the only reason they're defending Al Franken is because they want to defend Roy Moore obviously that's what's going on here in the demo rats are only throwing out Franken under the bus because they want to get ROI morons ahnold's rum so understand this is all a political game don't suddenly think that politicians grew moral spines they didn't okay I would be happy if they had and maybe we can force them into doing so but I don't really see the purpose of pretending that there's no politics at work here at all because that's just that's just silly well in a second I want to play you what Al Franken actually had to say but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Birch gold so with the increasing uncertainty of the upcoming of the of the upcoming events with with disaster in the air

can view online as well okay so we do finally have tape of Al Franken the fact that Democrats thought this guy was a viable 2020 contender tells you everything you need to know about the state of the Democratic Party but here is al franken on the floor of the Senate resigning but not before claiming that he's innocent and that he'd be murdered nevertheless today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who is bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girl's campaigns for the Senate with with the full support of his party yeah and so that's the that's the line the Democrats are going to use so when you say this isn't political of course it's political now Franken were smart if he had any sense of the moment what he would do instead is hew to a full mayor call Paul right he'd get up there and instead of denying that the accuser instead of saying the accusers are a bunch of terrible people who are lying about him and that he's a wounded innocent he and he then went on to say I'll be fine you know I was comedian before this I'll be fine everything will be fine what he should have done if he were smart is he would have said all of these women I believe them women deserve to be believed I've made a lot of mistakes I apologized fulsomely for the mistakes that I've made and in this new America I hope to change for the better and President Trump is evidence that the Republicans are not changing for the better if I have to step down as I should then I call on President Trump to step down as well right he should have actually turned it into a rallying cry but he's not smart enough to do that he doesn't have the wherewithal to do that if he'd done that the media would have actually orgasmed like people actually would have would have experienced physical pleasure and at that point he could have run for president in 2020 but he doesn't have the brains to do that as I say the Republicans meanwhile are rushing to defend Roy Moore and this is something that I think is is both stupid and backwards so they're a bunch of people saying well you know the Democrats are only doing this for political reasons so why should we came and there is this mentality on the right now that when the Democrats will want something you don't give it to them just because they just because they want it right but that's not the case with Roy Moore okay there's this there's this new mentality that I think has has taken hold among a lot of Republicans among some conservatives that just because the Democrats don't want something they or just because the Democrats want something you can't give it to them that the Democrats because their political everything that they say is false that's not right and it also leads you down a pretty dark road and I think that you know Steve Bannon is sort of the avatar of this I think Steve Bannon really helps make this sort of mentality come to fruition right aux a little bit about him yesterday with regard to what he was saying about Roy Moore and turning on Mitt Romney and it is indicative of how a lot of Republicans are thinking right now which is that Roy Moore must be innocent because the Democrats say he's guilty that Roy Moore must be defended the Democrats wants him out I don't see why you would surrender the moral high-ground this way on a race that Republicans you know if they had thrown more out earlier or more resigned they would have won this race walking away even if Roy Jones Doug Jones the Democrat were to win this seat Republicans would be able to regain the seat in four years when it comes up again it's a heavily red state but instead the Republicans seem to be pushing the high ground away with both hands saying listen the Democrats got to play in the muck for a while now we're gonna play in the muck they don't understand there's a different standard that applies to Republicans there is as there should be because Republican not not that there should be a different standard for Republicans but the higher standard should apply to both Republicans and Democrats and I don't see the Republicans recognizing that baseline reality it is a baseline reality by the way that that that is the case you see that but with the doubt with the Republicans attacking Mitt Romney right Stephan Bannon yesterday attacking Mitt Romney and I just thought to myself there is a strain of the Republican Party that now says the worst the person the more we ought to support them and I think that's true among Democrats when it's politically beneficial for that to be the case I think they'll get there too and they'll use the polarization in politics has an excuse to get there and Republicans aren't wrong that a lot rides on politics that a lot is at stake but they are wrong when they think that the way that they are going to win is by is by embracing the worst elements of their of their own of their own egos and their own id's I just think that's that's a huge mistake now with all that said I understand why the frustrate frustration among the Republicans why there's so much frustration that the Democrats been getting away with this stuff for 20 years and not just on the sexual-assault front but on the corruption front this is a story that sort of went unmentioned but it's amazing the New York Times has a report on the operation of the consumer protection financial Bureau under the command of interim director Mick Mulvaney and in the article is a real piece of news that a group of bureaucrats have decided to hijack the CFPB as much as possible and operate in secret to define Mulvaney this according to hot air comm here's what they actually said agency employees said they were scrutinizing every comment and memo from their new leader for hints about their future some employees including a few of the bureau's top officials have welcomed their new leader others pointing to mr. Mulvaney's earlier hostility toward the agency and his mission are quietly resisting one small group calls itself Dumbledore's Army according to two of the people who are familiar their discussions the name is a reference to a secret resistance force in the Harry Potter books and atmosphere of intense anxiety has taken hold several employee said so um first of all read another book not every reference has to be about Harry Potter but second of all there's an actual band of bureaucrats inside the CFPB trying to buck Trump and call himself Dumbledore's Army then you wonder why Republicans are so frustrated they say that they say we need someone who's willing to break the rules to stop a bunch of people who are willing to break the rules the frustration with partisan politics has driven both sides mad and if the standard can only be restored through hypocrisy then better that the standards should be restored through the hypocrisy of going after Al Franken in order to get to Roy more than that the standard never be restored at all okay so in other news there's a lot of fallout over what's happening in Jerusalem right now so the President of the United States yesterday made the announcement that Jerusalem was in fact to be recognized as the capital of Israel by the American government and that he'll be working to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which makes perfect sense Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people always was the capital of Israel always will be the capital of Israel here is president Trump announcing that yesterday after more than two decades of waivers we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians it would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result therefore I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise they failed to deliver today I am delivering I've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians full marks for this I mean this is it this is a brave move by the President of the United States and of course the media because they foster terrorism and they don't mind terrorism and they were fine with the Gaza war and they're rooting for Hamas many of them now they're turning on Trump and say well it's because of this that there will be violence in the Middle East you're right the terrorist group Hamas which is a terrorist group there was a really angry only over Jerusalem then they declared a three days of Rage I love this the media oh my god days of Rage from the Palestinians days of Rage man they wouldn't be enraged except for Trump this is the fourth time the Palestinians fourth have declared a day of rage in the last eight months okay since April they've declared four days of Rage this is the last day like ever is it ad anding enlighten today of Rage in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in Judea and Samaria and Gaza right the Palestinians are constantly pushing days of Rage why because the leadership is corrupt because the leadership are a bunch of terrorists because the population voted for that leadership and because the leadership knows that if they attack Israel they don't actually have to provide anything to their own citizens and so the media coverage which is treating this is like it's panic time it's the end of the world it's all because of sure it's all because of Trump it's just a nonsense okay Hamas 1988 is their covenant this is their founding document quote Israel Judaism and Jews challenge Islam and the Moslem people may the cowards never sleep PLO charters the Palestinian Authority right is Mahmoud Abbas is group quote the establishment of Israel is illegal and null and void that was in 1964 before Israel even controlled the Old City of Jerusalem before they even controlled East Jerusalem and they were calling for the destruction of Israel but know something something is definitely changed Abbas by the way made a speech yesterday where he quote noted long Christian and Muslim history in Jerusalem makes no mention of Jewish history their quote it's an attempt to change our history and it will not succeed it's a Palestinian city in Arab City a Christian city and a Muslim city okay so it's not the Jews not recognizing that Islam and that the Muslims have connections to to Jerusalem worth the I mean it's the Jews we Jews and Israelis in particular who have acknowledged that holy sites should remain open but the fact that yet but but the fact that the Muslim population over there doesn't want Jewish sites to remain open that as I talked about yesterday when the Muslims controlled Jerusalem they refused to allow access to holy sites to Jews and actually started riot if Jews brought so much as a folding chair for the ill and the infirm to pray at the western wall you know and now the media is blaming Trump for acknowledging a reality it's just insipid and because of that because of that you're gonna get more terrorism because the the terrorists know it's funny the same people who will say let's not name mass shooters we can't name mass shooters if we name mass shooters it's glorifying the mass shootings there's some merit to that the idea that they are going to go out there and go out in the middle of the Gaza Strip or Judea and Samaria and put a camera on a bunch of people burning stuff and treat this as though it's Trump's fault all that's doing is fostering terrorism they're gonna get people killed the media's and the media's attempts to create a massive conflagration out of this it's just going to encourage terrorists to be terrorists this is what the media do its roots really despicable and this has some far ranging ramifications outside of Israel by the way we'll talk about those plus BB Netanyahu's response in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at filter by comm so right now in California we are experiencing wildfire season when I say we're

Netanyahu thanks president Trump for what Trump did yesterday as well he should here was Netanyahu yesterday the president's decision is an important step towards peace for there is no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel president Trump thank you for today's historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital the Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful okay and that's exactly right I was talking to some people who are in Jerusalem yesterday they were ecstatic as well they should be and again this is just a recognition of reality it's not that something fundamentally has changed if you aren't gonna recognize the reality of how the world works you're never gonna be able to achieve peace the media don't want to accept this no the media are trying to treat this as though this was some sort of crazy move by Trump cuz Trump's a crazy man and Trump's gonna set the world afire let's be really clear about one thing one of the things that's really ironic here Cid Arabia doesn't give a crap about Jerusalem the Jordanians don't give a crap about Jerusalem the Egyptians don't give a crap about your Islam they're not gonna back any Palestinian uprising against the Israelis you know why because of Barack Obama not because of Trump because of Barack Obama because Barack Obama made Iran a regional power and now Saudi Arabia Jordan and Egypt they're all siding with Israel and attempt to create a coalition to check Iranian growth in the region so the Palestinians are on their own so if you're lamenting the poor Palestinians being on their own against the big bad Israelis talk to President Obama not President Trump because the fact is that coalition only exists on the back of President Obama's decision to make Iran a regional power pretty incredible stuff but again the media are stirring this stuff they're stirring the pot they did it during the Gaza war I went on CNN I said that if Hamas could have created a news network it would look a lot like CNN but you go back and look at the tape and the reason I said that is because CNN always covers these these conflagrations not as a bunch of terrorists who've decided to murder Jews and it as an excuse for media attention and an attempt to pressure Israel but they treat it as a spontaneous outburst thing of rage it's not spontaneous folks nothing happened yesterday that means it's an organized effort okay apparently there's basic lockdown in the city of Jerusalem right now Jews told to stay home stay indoors not take public transportation because of the fears of terrorism again the Israelis been pressured into many concessions including the full withdrawal of Jews from the Gaza Strip making it completely you'd and ride they pulled out six thousand Jews from their homes in the Gaza Strip there was not one riot there was not one killing from the Jews Jerusalem has just declared the capital of Israel by the United States it has been forever the capital of Israel and the Palestinians are using that as an excuse to ride but again it's just an excuse they rioted earlier this year when three Palestinians stabbed someone to death and tried to shoot some people up on the Temple Mount and the Israelis installed metal detectors there were riots in Jerusalem over metal detectors so as I say basically damning and why Palestinians are gonna riot and the media is gonna treat it as though they have a legit excuse to do so because they really despise the Israelis and they despise the Israeli government led by Bibi Netanyahu Chris Matthews is one element of this so here's Chris Matthews all right happens at least a show another thing about Ezra done nothing about Christians but you know the reason Trump did this is because Jesus that's why I could because of Jesus go and a couple more points in our bama don't think this is a related to Alabama next week it is related because it's the Christian evangelicals down there with their crazy ideas about Israel which is I don't know mythical they don't understand the situation over there and how tricky it is ethnically and tribally they don't care because it's a religious belief Trump's plane to that this week you watch them okay so it's all about the crazy evangelicals their crazy beliefs you mean the crazy judeo-christian beliefs that undergird all of Western civilization would that be those beliefs or is he talking about this myth that all evangelical Christians wants all the Jews to go back to Israel so that Armageddon will come and Jesus will return because that's a very small minority of evangelical Christians I spent a lot more time with un Jellicle Christians than Chris Matthews has and he is just ignorant he's just ignorant I talk with evangelical Christians all the time the reason they support Israel is because they believe that they are the branch of which Israel is the route that Israel is the route the people of Israel were the route God's promised to Israel is the route of the and they are the branch from the same tree and they believe that the Jews are God's chosen people and they don't just believe that because they want Armageddon to come that's a tiny minority of evangelical Christians like when I say Tonya I mean minut infinitesimal if you want to see the level of support for Israel from people like Pastor John Hagee for example and Kufa the Christians United for Israel they're not doing that because they think that Jesus gonna come back and they're gonna get raptured up to heaven and that's why they're doing this Chris Mathis has to slander all of the people who support Israel among the Christians in in the United States because the left really despises real this is one area where it's it's become increasingly partisan and it's really sad the fact is that 90 nothing 19 even but like dianne feinstein come out and say it's just terrible the Trump did this 90 nothing including Dianne Feinstein's vote they voted in June to say that Jerusalem was the undivided capital of Israel after they voted in June okay I was like a few months ago and now they're coming out and saying it's the end of the world that Trump announced all this and then of course you have media flax like Fareed Zakaria on CNN saying that Trump isn't really siding with Israel you see when Trump declares that the Israeli capital Jerusalem is the Israeli capital Jerusalem and the eternal capital of the Jewish people is the eternal capital of the Jewish people he's not really siding with Israel he's just siding with Netanyahu and the Israeli government Israel doesn't need you know the United States has an ally anymore in the sense that they're the most powerful force on the ground by far Israel is sort of a regional superpower and compared to the Palestinians the disproportion is now just gigantic what they need is for the United States to have credibility with the Palestinians so that there can be a meaningful negotiation if the United States is seen as blatantly one-sided it doesn't help and by the way this is an issue on which the United States would be citing not with Israel but with the current Israeli government a this is absolute sheer unmitigated nonsense the labor party okay the left of Israeli politics supports president Trump's decision on this the left likes president Trump's decision on this in Israel when Fareed Zakaria says that we need that America needs to be seen as an honest broker in order to broker a peace that's not true okay the the United States should be throwing its weight on the side of the of the people who actually are in favor of Liberty why should there be another terrorist state in the region if there's gonna be peace the Palestinian Authority has to go Hamas has to go Islamic Jihad has to go and what you need instead is something like a regular liberal government yeah you can't just say that the United States should be an honest broker between al Qaeda and the government of Pakistan and you can't say that in in a far worse way you certainly can't say that the State should be an honest broker between Israel and its terrorist enemies it's just insipid okay so meanwhile in in other news I want to talk a little bit about some trends in American thinking particularly among young people because this is pretty crazy stuff so there is a there's a an article today about capitalism and how young Americans feel about capitalism from The Wall Street Journal and it is pretty stunning how few Americans young Americans particularly know what capitalism is so there's an article it says that in a 2016 survey for Harvard University's Institute of Politics 42% of younger Americans said they support capitalism only 19 percent identified themselves as capitalists is according to john de la Volpe who's been pulling Millennials for 17 years right 42 percent of young Americans said they support capitalism which means 58 percent do not and 19 percent identified themselves as capitalists the reason that I think this is the case is because the Democrats and Bernie Sanders in particular have done a wonderful job of redefining capitalism away from its meaning and Republicans have never discussed capitalism in moral terms it's something I like talking about a lot the reason that capitalism is a good is not just because it's more efficient and creates better products is because it says that the stuff that you create you get to keep the stuff that you create you get to keep and no one can be the master of your time or labor no one gets to enslave you just because they have needs right you're you this is the John Locke view of capitalism right John Locke's view of property ownership is that you combine your labor with the land and that's why you have a right to land the same thing holds true of capital you combine your labor with capital you compile you combine your input with capital your investment knowledge with capital and now that is your money and the idea that anyone can take that money away from you just because they want the money for their own purposes is morally obtuse but people on the right don't talk about capitalism this way instead what we'll say is well you know capitalism it's just sort of the best available system and there's also this tendency I think to to say as many have said in the past that did you know sort of two cheers for capitalism the capitalism is the best possible system but it doesn't tell you that you have to be moral that's true but when you're talking about economic socialism doesn't tell you that you have to be moral either there's nothing moral about socialism we're talking about economic systems and why economic systems ought to be upheld from oral standpoint you have to start from the basic notion that human beings have Liberty that individuals are guaranteed Liberty and they're all made in God's image and we are all equal in our rights before God that does not mean that we all get to steal stuff from one another and socialism is immoral capitalism is moral but young people are never told that instead what they see is greedy plutocrats who are combining with the government and capitalism itself is slandered in the media so every time there is a in actual greedy plutocrat it makes a deal with the government any time in Wall Street gets rich off an insider crony zeal of Congress instead of people responding by saying that's not capitalism even the right we'll call it crony capitalism crony capitalism is not a real term crony capitalism is the reverse of capitalism it's actually called corporatism there is no reason to describe anything as crony capitalism because capitalism is about the free investment in exchange of goods but the right never describes capitalism that way and so young people don't know any better and so they ends up in this sort of weird spot where they think capitalism is bad but it's not just ignorance on that there's a Pew poll that came out yesterday that really is quite astonishing in in its ramifications so this is this is what the poll shows it's assessments on whether life is better or worse than it was 50 years ago and it shows what people think in various countries so the very bottom of the list of course is Venezuela where people are eating dogs but the very top of the list is Vietnam where they say 88 percent say it's better than it was 50 years ago that makes sense in 1967 we're in the middle of the Vietnam War so things were pretty bad at that point and the Vietcong took over and that was pretty bad too Vietnam has opened up a fair bit since then India is number two on the list of places that are better off than they were 50 years ago these are obviously countries that understand that that economic development matters right South Korea Japan Germany Turkey Turkey's an interesting one because 50 the I'm not sure honest to be honest with you where turkey was 50 years ago but in recent years they've obviously slid and then you have the Netherlands Sweden Poland Spain a lot of countries that are from the former Soviet bloc so where is the United States here where is the United States when it comes to our people better off or worse off than they were 50 years ago this is an amazing statistic only 37% of Americans say that Americans are better off today than they were 50 years ago 41% of Americans say that they are worse off than they were 50 years ago 50 years ago in 1967 in the middle of riots in the United States in the middle of the Vietnam War with economic development that you know having a car was was a having a nice car was still a luxury you know where you didn't have the Internet you didn't have the houses were smaller air conditioning was still not Universal central air central heating right there weren't such a thing as computers the living standard in the United States is so much higher than it was in 1967 and yet Americans believe that this is not the case that they are they were better off then and this is one of the problems I think in American politics right now there's this sort of nostalgia for a better time there was no better time I've said this before you are living in the best time in history okay this is the better time when people say do when you wish you had lived right now you know why because I can connect with any piece of information on the planet at any time of night or day hey I can go to the grocery store and I can get any delicacy I want from anywhere on planet Earth I can live in a bigger house if I can pay for it and I can pay for it right this is one of the beautiful things about living in the United States things have gotten incredibly better but people refuse to recognize this and so instead you ends up with this weird perception that things have gotten worse and if you think things have gotten worse you end up in desperate straits cuz you think things are constantly getting bad then every election you're one step from the end of the country every election is the end of the road you can't have a forward-looking view where you say yeah Obama was garbage who's a bad president if you're on the right but guess what the country didn't collapse and that means that we can actually build a movement and move the country towards something even more glorious instead every election becomes the be-all end-all you see the same thing from Democrats where one election from Armageddon if you always think in one election from Armageddon you're actually bringing Armageddon closer talking about how Armageddon is right around the corner makes people act as though Armageddon is right around the corner and if you act as the Armageddon is right around the corner it probably is by the way life expectancy in the United States in 1967 at points of birth was 71 years today life expectancy in the United States is 79 years on that basis alone life is significantly better in the United States than it was 50 years ago I mean especially for minorities he kidding me like black people in 1967 versus black people in 2017 are you out of your mind to think that things were better in 1967 literal race riots in Detroit in 1967 hey you really if you were gay in 1967 you better off now or better in 1967 if you're Jewish hey this is all it's all it's all nonsense but but unfortunately we have a tendency to be pessimists about reality and this leads us some down some dark roads and toward a nostalgia on one side that says that we can rectify everything with big government and nostalgia on the other side that says that we have to freeze everything in place lest lest we fall into the best okay so I want to get some things I like and some things I hate but

then the big idea because it's a Thursday can't believe it's a Thursday already and also this week has been endless so okay time for some things that I like so the other night my wife and I went to see a movie which was just a pleasure once in a while I actually get to see my wife and it's nice when that happens and the movie was Murder on the Orient Express so I'm a big alpha a gothic Christie fan I own all of her novels I knew the ending my wife didn't so this is one of those things where it's really fun to watch if the person you're watching with does not know the ending to Murder on the Orient Express because if you don't know the ending it's one of the great endings in kind of murder mystery literature the the middle of the movie where Poirot is sort of investigating the crimes is not my favorite the beginning I think is clever and then you get to the end and the end is I think actually quite effective it's based on Murder on the Orient Express I believe the book was written 1934 it was originally based on the Charles Lindbergh baby kidnapping so if you don't know about that case Charles Lindbergh and his wife had a baby the baby was kidnapped and killed by I believe a German guy named Bruno Hauptmann was the guy who was put on trial for it this book was based on that and it's not a giveaway to say that the character who's killed right it's called Murder on the Orient Express someone has killed the person who was killed it turns out was involved in a similar kidnapping and the whole movie is sort of about that it's effective I think Branagh uses some nice touches I don't want to give spoilers because the movies still out in theatres but there are some differences from the books Poirot himself his whole character is much more sympathetic in the movie than he would be in the books and the books Poirot is basically a machine he used he uses little gray cells to logically deduce things but in the movie he has a lot more sympathy and they sort of give him not a love interest but they say that his he's had a wife who died that's not true in the books in the books he he'd never had a love interest but the cast I think a lot of the cast is quite good Branagh is fun to watch Michelle Pfeiffer is actually terrific in it Johnny Depp is really good I don't like Johnny Depp as an actor and Johnny Depp actually is really good in this so check it out I'm around the orange Express here's a little bit of preview would you mind if I join you good a world-famous detective Hercule Poirot the bender of the innocent is that what they told you in the papers and you are you no sense a passenger has died he was murdered the murderer is on the train with us now and every one of you is a suspect so let us catch a killer so there there are a few things in the movie that would have made it better one is that the murder takes place on a train on a moving train what would have been nice in a bunch of sleeper cars that are bright back to back it would have been nice to have like a map of the sleeper car this appointment by sunny Bunch on the weekly standard of podcasts and I think it's right that one shot from above that shows where everybody was in the cars would be very helpful but you don't actually get that but the movie itself is is worth what particularly the end of it is is pretty effective I think okay so time for some other things that I like so this I thought was just hilarious so yesterday or a couple days ago on the show I said that it was a lifelong dream to appear on the view and I was very excited about this Paula Faris who is an occasional co-host on the view and she's on Good Morning America she tweeted out hey Ben I heard on your podcast that wanted her lifelong dreams to swip here on the view I'm running it by the incomparable Joy Behar stay tuned then she tweeted out a picture of herself with Joy Behar all I can say is I accept yes make this happen it would be the greatest hour of television in the history of daytime it would be so good I believe there's a petition online to petition ABC to have me on it would be a lot of fun I've made fun of the view at times but I will but I will I will be cordial and and in kind so check it out if they have me on the view it'll be fantastic I could not be more excited about this I was dancing around the office yesterday and May it's hard to make me happy so Thank You Paula Faris and I hope that this actually happens okay time for a couple of things that I hate so thing number one that I hate this is insane so there are a couple of things that are happening as far as college campuses that are trying to keep me out now there's one college campus that is I'm trying to remember which college campus it is at Concordia College I'm with and they are now trying to withdraw funding so they funded my event there and now they're trying to withdraw funding so that's very exciting that's piece of college news number one piece of college renews number two is that a sociology professor at the University of California Merced told students that he wouldn't debate me but he would enjoy ripping my arms out of the socket like a wookie apparently so here's here's a little bit of the audio that was gotten holded by Campus reform I wouldn't because that hole is putting this nonsense - I'd be on equal footing with me using my real degree to legitimize garbage policies nonsense word means gladiator you should pass this around while I won't debate this fool why don't y'all set up some kind of MMA thing between you and then the winner can see equals forty thousand dollars they give them to whatever charity they want charity charity I don't think I wouldn't enjoy rooting this boy's shoulder out of its socket oh my god I don't know so he's a really real intellectual here ripping this fools shoulder out of his socket he sounds like somebody who I'd have a real tough time debating mainly because I'm not sure that he speaks in in full sentences what a genius he is I mean and I love when he says he wants me to use my my real degree to debate him dude you're a sociology professor okay real degree I went to Harvard Law School like shut up it's just as absurd and this notion that I'm gonna go and have a physical fight with you we have this thing here it's called civilization it's where we have debates rights where we talk about things but your response to an actual civilized debate is you want to rip somebody's arm out of their sock and what fascist nonsense this is the second professor I know of who suggested that we have a fight I know everybody always wants to have fights with me like I know you think I'm not physically pre possessing and you think that you can beat me up and all this kind of nonsense you know what I have more money than you I can pay people to beat you up if I wanted to I don't need to beat you up physically plus I can defeat you intellectually anytime I choose so of course they revert back to their schoolyard bully nonsense that they've always been reverting to just just what stupidity okay so other things that I hate how stupid are the American people about Star Wars I just have to ask this because there's a poll that came out yesterday and I have to show you the results of this poll okay classic this is a poll from morning consult among 2,200 US adults on the popularity of various figures from Star Wars no not shockingly none of the new Star Wars figures basically make the list I'm shocked that June or so ends up so low right sure so it ends up at 29% she's one from rogue one okay how it has jyn erso it 29% in Jar Jar Binks is at 37% Jar Jar fricken banks right fin barely najat nudges out Jar Jar Binks bb-8 barely nudges out Jar Jar Binks okay that's amazing it's incredible Emperor Palpatine by the way only finishing at 31% Emperor Palpatine is only at 31 like how is that possible darth vader is only at 49% this is percentage that is a favorable impression of each character but I'll tell you what the worst injustice here is okay the worst injustice obviously is that the people who are at the top of the list okay lay is number one fine you know men have a good impression of Leia and so do women that's cool but Luke Skywalker is number two at 72% and Han Solo's at 68 percent who are you people what is wrong with you han Solo has less of a positive percentage than Luke Skywalker I mean even if you include the new movie Luke Skywalker has been on an island doing nothing staring at rocks for like 20 years Luke Skywalker over over han Solo just insane Luke Skywalker over obi-wan Kenobi Luke Skywalker should be down by like Jabba the Hutt Luke Skywalker Lando comes in at 43% how does Lando finish beneath beneath c-3po or Anakin Skywalker they they actually separated out Anakin and Darth Vader how does he Anakin finish above Darth Vader how how is that a thing you'll go to hell have you even seen these movies so wrong with you people okay time for the big ideas on Thursdays we talk about a big idea that requires elucidation and so today we will talk about freedom of association freedom of association is not an actual stated constitutional right it's pretty obvious that the Constitution means that you get to hang out with whoever you want to hang out with because freedom of speech and freedom of assembly both mean freedom of association right I get to say what I want and the government can't control that and I also get two so I get to assemble for petition and assemble in groups however I want and the Supreme Court has found in cases like the n-double-a-cp versus Alabama in 1958 that the n-double-a-cp did not have to reveal to the Alabama Attorney General the names and addresses of n-double-a-cp members in the state because I would violate freedom of association in 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts could revoke the membership of a performer Eagle Scout when it found out that he was a gay rights activist because they said they have freedom of association freedom of association is vital because it seems to me that this should be applied to the business space as well I get to associate with whom I want I don't have to associate with anybody else and I understand that there are lots of things that people do that are bad and of what you don't approve and then historically speaking there have been lots of people in the United States who have engaged in discriminatory practices against various members of the population that does not mean the government gets to for at least the federal government does not get to come in and force you to tailor to audiences that you don't want or to perform businesses with people you don't want now this is an extreme version of the argument is being made in the masterpiece cake shop case in that case they're not even basing it on freedom of association they're saying I have freedom of speech you can't force me to express a message right I'm an artist you can't force me to express a message which is a very strong argument I would go further I would say you you actually should be able to turn away people from your business even if you just don't like their face right you should be able to do that does that make you a jerk absolutely does it make you a bad person yes should you be able to do it yes because that is true for every Association right if I have a synagogue I shouldn't be forced to admit a Christian to my synagogue and if I have a if I have a church I shouldn't be forced to admit a Jew right the idea of freedom of association requires that we all act in in society together and then we cultivate good people but the idea that government has to force it down our throats I think is a big mistake this became a big debate during the 1964 Civil Rights Acts and there were a lot of people making exactly the argument I'm making Barry Goldwater made this argument Barry Goldwater was a civil rights activist by the way and people proclaim that he was racist because he said that people have the right to choose with whom they do business even if you don't like the choices that they make and he was portrayed as some sort of evil racist for all of this there is no principled argument for freedom of association if the government gets to decide with whom you associate end of story so that's the history of freedom of association in a nutshell it should still apply unfortunately it's a right that's been increasingly written out over time we should rewrite it back into the Constitution because if you don't like me you shouldn't be forced to associate with me and vice versa okay we will be back here tomorrow with all the latest and greatest i'm ben shapiro is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced
