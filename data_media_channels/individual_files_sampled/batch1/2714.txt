humankind has been listening for signs from et for decades but what if we're going about it all wrong here are four ways that aliens might contact us and we wouldn't know number one high energy signals right now scientists can only track potential alien signals sent over radio waves or visible lights but there's an entire electromagnetic spectrum of radiation that aliens could encode a message with to contact us number two manipulate light a single burst of bright light could get earthlings attention but it would cost a lot of energy instead aliens might transmit the same dim signal repeatedly over time but it's likely that we would miss this because scientists have no way of monitoring the entire sky for long periods of time number three robotic probes there's a chance that extraterrestrials would send something physical instead like a probe it would take a probe longer to traverse the vast distances in space than a beam of light but it could carry more information unless the probe were on a collision course with earth however we would probably miss it because we lack a network of telescopes that can spot small nearby objects number four megastructures instead of sending signals directly to earth aliens could try to signal anyone who might be watching the best way to do this is construct a giant structure like a Dyson Sphere it looks unlike any natural phenomenon in the cosmos astronomers think they've found a potential mega structure around the star kic 8 4 6 - 8 5 - but right now our instruments of observation are limited making confirmation extremely difficult our aliens out there trying to say hello the answer might rely on a simple change to our search methods or we might have to wait until our technology improves either way we may not be far from making contact
