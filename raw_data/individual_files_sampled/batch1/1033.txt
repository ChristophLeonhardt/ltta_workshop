seventy years have passed since the netbook the catastrophe in Arabic took place in Palestine in 1948 in which more than 750,000 Palestinians were forcefully displaced from their homes and pushed into refugee camps in East Jerusalem the West Bank the Gaza Strip and neighboring countries but the nut but didn't end in 1948 the catastrophe continues to affect more than 12 million Palestinians who remain stateless today historical Palestine was mostly made up of Palestinian Muslims Christians and a small number of Jews who generally lived together peacefully the persecution of Jews across Europe led them to believe that they were not safe there and Zionists saw Palestine as a prime location for a Jewish homeland and it was clear that there were Palestinians on the land Zionist leaders and common people alike would get used to the idea that the only way of making Palestine a Jewish state is by causing the Palestinians to leave the Jewish Zionist movement began organizing emigration and buying land in Palestine this was the first step in turning Palestine into a Jewish homeland then World War 1 began Britain promised scientists support for a Jewish National Home in Palestine this came as a formal political letter known today as the Balfour Declaration it also included that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine when World War one ended and the Ottoman Empire was defeated Britain occupied Palestine Britain provided the muscle under which they could simply emigrate I mean he couldn't have emigrated were it not for the British presence because the the the crucial battle in the early stages was simply getting Jews into Palestine and acquiring land they couldn't have done that without British government's sponsorship Jewish migration into Palestine continued for decades and the Palestinian people organized large demonstrations against this influence Palestinians saw British support of Zionism as biased and unfair so the people of Palestine revolted in 1936 to fight against British and Zionist occupation during the three-year uprising thousands of Palestinians were killed and hundreds of British citizens and Jewish Zionists died as well Britain dismantled the Palestinian revolution leaving them with no political or military leadership however the British also began limiting Jewish migration this upset the Jews who had fought with the British during the uprising and led them to create their own forces Zionist militias carried out bombing attacks against both the British and the Palestinians as things got out of hand the British announced in 1947 that they'd be ending their mandate on Palestine the file on Palestine was then transferred to the UN which suggested dividing Palestine into an Arab and Jewish state as the British were preparing to leave the new Jewish population began taking over and it helped that they were heavily armed the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians began months before the British officially left Palestine Zionists were taking over major cities and hundreds of villages forcing thousands of Palestinians into neighboring countries it happened many times that the Israeli very holy soldiers took ten of the youngsters in the middle of the village shot them just in order to kill them in other words all the others will see and run away and if it's not enough they took others also the British ended their mandate on May 14th 1948 leaving their tanks and armored weapons to the newly created State of Israel from the time the British occupied Palestine in 1917 - when they left in 1948 the number of Jews is estimated to have multiplied ten times - half a million as Zionist Jews declared the State of Israel on May 14th 1948 the surrounding Arab nations declared war with the objective of liberating Palestine although Palestine had the support of other Arab nations and they outnumbered the Jewish population the Israelis also had foreign military political and financial support they were highly prepare highly dedicated well-armed fighting force which was superior to all the Arab armies attack israel grew beyond the UN Partition mines during the arab-israeli war by destroying Arab villages and further reducing the Palestinian population by April 1949 more than 500 villages and ten cities were captured by the Israelis over 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes and over 13,000 Palestinians had been killed even then the net buck did not end today Israel occupies the whole of historical Palestine this rallies continued to build illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian territory Palestinians in the West Bank live under military law which subjects them to checkpoints curfews and arbitrary arrests Palestinians in Gaza live under a blockade imposed by Israel Gaza is set to become unlivable by 2020 Palestinians today continue to demand their right to return to their homes for them the nutfah will not end until this right is granted
