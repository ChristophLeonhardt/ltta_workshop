well she had the audacity to show a short TV clip 5 minutes long of Peterson in her class not to advocate for Peterson but to simply show him as one point of view in a debate which he is pretty much what the course is about what university is about I understand it was from this TV Ontario show called the agenda with Steve Paikin which is about as mild as TV gets in Canada I mean Steve Paikin pretty straight shooter now let's say you don't like that so you debate it you practice your critical thinking you practice being an intellectual grown-up you practice critiquing and rebutting things you speak out Lindsay Shepard isn't exactly the most terrifying person in the world she says she's left-wing and progressive and I'm sure that's true there is no adult who could honestly say that they were afraid to ask a leftist question of this mild-mannered teaching assistant at a leftist campus I just don't believe it but then Lindsay was summoned to a kangaroo court at a sort of a star chamber where she was grilled by academics for having the audacity who has shown a clip of Professor Peterson in class they literally compared showing a clip of that video to showing a Hitler movie they literally called showing the video violence they said that violence and despite a request they never actually showed Lindsay the complaint against her what it said or who allegedly said him that star chamber stuff that's kangaroo court stuff that's Maoist stuff now you may have heard about this we've got a lot of press a few days ago at least in some quarters but over the weekend an audio recording of that star chamber was leaked to global news about ten minutes long and it is amazing it is shocking it is infuriating a pack of academics mainly feminist men you know the kind and a Marxist woman ganging up on Lindsay berating her comparing her to a Nazi literally driving her to tears she was crying that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to to watch the daily show every day including always to interview today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
