1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,934
“Would you like Mark Judge
to be interviewed?”

2
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:04,930
“That would be
my preference.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,880
I’m not sure it’s really
up to me, but ...”

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,640
Mark Judge.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,590
It’s a name that keeps coming
up in the Kavanaugh hearings.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,660
“Man, the old gym.”

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,190
So just who is Judge?

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,540
“And here’s something
very interesting.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,830
This is the JUG room, 
Justice Under God detention,

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,190
spent a lot of time in there.

11
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,920
It’s locked right now but ...”

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,010
In this self-shot
video posted online,

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,420
he’s walking around the
campus of Georgetown Prep,

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,370
the school he attended
years earlier

15
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,280
with Supreme Court nominee
Brett Kavanaugh.

16
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,550
“And I know they’ve asked
me not to film here.

17
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,360
They’ve told me
not to film here.

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,310
They’ve explained
the legal ramifications

19
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,160
of filming here.

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
But, this is part of my
past and these videos

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,880
are part of my history,

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,960
so — bring on the lawyers.”

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,550
Christine Blasey
Ford says Judge

24
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,130
was in the room when,
she alleges,

25
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,552
Kavanaugh sexually assaulted
her in the early 1980s.

26
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:56,510
“She says that you tried
to take off her clothes

27
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,550
and she believes that
you would have raped her

28
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,010
if Mark Judge hadn’t
climbed on top

29
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,760
and everyone tumbled
to the floor.

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,660
And then she had an
opportunity to get away.”

31
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,360
Judge and Kavanaugh were
close friends in high school

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,520
and both have denied
the episode occurred.

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,940
Additional women have since
come forward with accusations.

34
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,050
“We're starting to learn
more about Mark Judge.”

35
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,190
Judge is now a key figure
in the Kavanaugh hearings.

36
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,120
In other self-shot videos,

37
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,450
Judge discusses things like
spirituality and pop culture.

38
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,130
“It’s about mysticism.”

39
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,150
He also produced
numerous short films.

40
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,220
Many reviewed by The Times
seemed like mood pieces.

41
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,470
They don’t have dialogue,
and almost all feature

42
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,820
young-looking women,

43
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,230
some almost naked,
posing or staring at the camera.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,320
“I’ve been a journalist for —
since college, and ...”

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,160
Judge is a freelance writer,
author and filmmaker.

46
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,440
He has contributed to
conservative news sites

47
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,990
like The Daily Caller
and The Weekly Standard,

48
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,390
but also publications

49
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,900
like The Washington Post 
and The New York Times.

50
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,630
“I mean, I’m no
Andrew Breitbart,

51
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,600
but he is an inspiration.”

52
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,100
He has written
about topics ranging

53
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,860
from culture and conservatism

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,110
to masturbation
and male sexuality.

55
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,870
He has also written a
number of books, including

56
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,850
“Wasted: Tales of a Gen-X Drunk,”

57
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,000
where he recounts
drinking in high school

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,970
and includes a character
named Bart O’Kavanaugh,

59
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,550
a suspected reference
to Brett Kavanaugh.

60
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,710
After the
accusations surfaced,

61
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,450
Mark Judge’s
social media accounts

62
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,480
appeared to be taken offline,

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:00:00,000
and he has remained
out of the public eye.
