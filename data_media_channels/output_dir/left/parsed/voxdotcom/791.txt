Where Silk Comes from
Well, worm spit
Bombyx Mori 
aka. Silkworm
The silk production process 
is also known as Sericutlture.
It dates back to around 4,800 years ago in China.
Here is the process in action at the silk farm
Artisans Angkor, near Siem Reap, Cambodia
Larvae hatch out of these eggs after 14 days
Those eggs were laid by adult moths 
This one is dead
After millennia of domestication, 
the adult moths cannot fly
The larvae feast on MulberryLeaves
They eat continuously
For about 42 days
Then it's cocoon time
They spin their silk cocoon for 3-8 days
One strand. Secreted by sailvry glands.
About 1,000 feet long.
The chrysalis inside is then killed by steam
 or by laying in the sun or boiling
The cocoons are loosened in hot wtr and unwound
Several strands are spun together into a thread
Raw silk (outside of cocoon)
Fine silk (inside of cocoon)
Workers painstakingly remove lumps and debris
The silk is dyed any color of the rainbow
A  warping whel divides the fine silk thread
Fine silk
Raw silk
It takes about  2500 silkworms to make 1 pound of silk
