PETE: A TRULY INSPIRING STORY
LAST YEAR AS ONE SOLDIER, WAS
FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY IN
AFGHANISTAN, HE HAPPENED TO HEAR
THAT SONG, "MY OLD MAN"
ORIGINALLY PERFORMED BY THE ZAC
BROWN BAND IT MADE HIM THINK
ABOUT HIS FAMILY, HIS TWO KIDS
AND HIS WIFE BACK HOME IN THE
STATES, AND HIS DAD WHO HE
HADN'T SEEN IN A WHILE IT
INSPIRED HIM TO CONNECT WITH HIS
FATHER.
HE WOULD ALSO REACH OUT TO THE
VOCALIST, WHO YOU SEE IN THAT
RECREATION WHO HAPPENED TO BE
HIS MENTOR AND MATH INSTRUCTOR
AT WEST POINT.
HERE NOW, MAJOR PAUL LUSHENKO
AND COLONEL DOUG HOW DO
I SAY THAT?
MCINVALE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
YOUR TIME THIS MORNING BOTH OF
YOU.
>>  ABSOLUTELY.
PETE: THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR
SERVICE.
YOU WERE MOST RECENTLY IN
AFGHANISTAN SERVING OUR COUNTRY.
HOW DID YOU SEE THIS VIDEO AND
WHY DID IT AFFECT YOU SO MUCH?
>>  WELL, PETE YOU KNOW I'VE
KNOWN COLONEL MAC FOR 15 YEARS I
WAS INITIALLY A STUDENT IN HIS
MATH COURSE IN 2003 AND FIND
MYSELF DEPLOYED 15 YEARS LATER
IN AFGHANISTAN AND CHECK SOCIAL
MEDIA WHICH IS ATYPICAL CALL AND
SAW THIS FIRST STRUCK BY THE
TALENT THAT COLONEL MAC HAD
WHICH IS ABOUT SACRIFICE, MENTOR
SHIP AND LOVE.
PETE: UH-HUH AND YOU DECIDED HEY
, IT MAKES ME WANT TO RE
CONNECT WITH MY DAD.
>>  YEAH, I FIRST SENT A NOTE TO
COLONEL MAC TO THANK HIM FOR THE
SONG AND SECOND SENT A NOTE TO
MY FATHER AS WELL AND REALLY
KIND OF BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN
TWO MEN IN MY LIFE THAT HAD
MEANT SO MUCH IN TERMS OF VALUES
, BASIC EDUCATION.
ABSOLUTELY COLONEL TO BE APART
OF A SONG LIKE THAT?
>>  TREMENDOUS IT WOULD NOT BE
POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF
THE ARTIST ZACH BROWN AND HIS
TEAM AND THE WEST POINT BAND SAW
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THE
MESSAGE ABOUT LOVE AND
LEADERSHIP WHICH IS A LOT ABOUT
WHAT FATHERHOOD IS A MESSAGE IN
OUR NATION THAT WE NEED MORE
THAN EVER ABOUT LOVE AND
LEADERSHIP.
PETE: BUT SUCH A PERSONAL
CONNECTION DID YOU EXPECT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO RESONATE
WITH ONE OF YOUR FORMER STUDENTS
, A MAJOR DEPLOYED IN
AFGHANISTAN?
>>  IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE
STUDENTS AND FOR HIM TO CONNECT
WITH ME WAS FROM DOWN RANGE AND
TO RECONNECT AGAIN HAS BEEN
FABULOUS.
PETE: ABSOLUTELY.
>>  AND WHAT WAS REALLY
INTERESTING ABOUT IT PETE WAS
NOT ONLY WAS THERE AN E-MAIL BUT
I'D GONE BACK UP TO WEST POINT
FOLLOWING THE ROTATION FOR AN
EVENT AND MADE A POINT OF
STOPPING BY HIS OFFICE AND
EXPLAINED HOW MUCH IT MEANT TO
ME AND ALSO TO A LOT OF OTHER
SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, AND
MARINES WHO ARE DEPLOYED AND
FATHERS IN HARMS WAY.
PETE: TALK TO US ABOUT THAT
BEING A FATHER ON FATHER'S DAY
DOWN RANGE OVERSEAS, WHAT'S THAT
LIKE?
>>  WELL, OUR EXPERIENCES ARE NO
DIFFERENT FROM A VAST MAJORITY
AND YOU KNOW THIS HAVING SERVED
YOURSELF.
AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO DEPLOY AND
MISS HOLIDAYS, BIRTHDAYS AND
ANNIVERSARIES BUT I THINK FOR ME
THIS SONG RESONATED AT A TOUGH
TIME IN THE DEPLOYMENT BECAUSE
IT SPOKE TO SACRIFICE AND THAT
WE WERE SERVING TOWARDS A
BRIGHTER FUTURE, MORE SECURE
FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN.
PETE: ABSOLUTELY COLONEL THE
MESSAGE OF THE SONG, THE MESSAGE
OF FATHERHOOD, IT'S PASSING INTO
THE NEXT GENERATION.
>>  IT IS THAT PASSING ALONG.
THERE'S MENTORS IN MY LIFE I
THINK BACK TO MY SPONSOR AS A
CADET OR JOHN CAMPBELL IN MY
CAREER AND I LOOK AT THEM AND AS
A MENTOR TO BE CONSIDERED ONE
FOR PAUL IS JUST HUMBLING AND I
THINK ABOUT MY ULTIMATE MENTOR
MY FATHER WHOSE ACTUALLY OUT OF
THE COUNTRY HELPING MY SISTER
WHOSE A MISSIONARY IN HONDURAS
TODAY SO IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE
ON FATHER'S DAY TO CELEBRATE HIM
PETE: NO DOUBT OUR FATHERS
ABSOLUTELY SHAPE WHO WE ARE.
MAJOR SOMETIMES I'VE GOT TO
SHAKE HANDS AT THE END OF THE
