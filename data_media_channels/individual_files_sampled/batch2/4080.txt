so with justice Brett Kavanaugh about to hear his first case on the Supreme Court let's take a look back at his record what we know about it where he might stand on some key issues they'll come before the court on abortion he has had only one major ruling in his time on the federal bench it was in 2017 the DC appeals court ruling in favor of an undocumented 17 year old seeking an abortion while being held by immigration authorities Cavanaugh dissented accusing his fellow judges of creating quote a new right for unlawful immigrant miners and US government's attention to obtain immediate abortion on demand as for his opinion on roe v wade Cavanaugh told the Judiciary Committee the landmark decision was quote settled as president of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times when it comes to LGBT rights Cavanaugh has no judicial record during his confirmation hearing he wouldn't say whether he believes Oberkfell vs. Hodges which legalized same-sex marriage was rightfully decided you'd only refer to tradition the tradition of nominees not giving opinions on hypotheticals saying quote they've all declined when asked to answer that question however and remarks at jordan nation George Mason University excuse me in 2016 he spoke positively about Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent in that case arguing quote for Justice Scalia it was not the courts job to improve on or update the Constitution to create new rights on gun rights Cavanaugh believes in the right to bear arms in 2011 the majority of his colleagues on the appellate court upheld DC's ban on possessing semi-automatic rifles but he wrote a 52 page dissent arguing the ban was unconstitutional because the weapons quote have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home hunting and other lawful uses he defended his opinion during his confirmation hearing saying quote my job was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court whether I agree with it or disagree with it and finally one issue that's considered most important to President Trump the question of executive power Cavanaugh writing an article in 2009 arguing that quote we should not burden a sitting president with civil suits Criminal Investigations or criminal prosecutions that we added that it would take an act of Congress to provide that kind of immunity during his confirmation hearings Cavanaugh R his writings were quote ideas for Congress to consider they were not my constitutional views the whole confirmation process has been an emotionally fraught whirlwind let's take a look now back at how it played out in the days leading up to this weekend's final vote there is a sense among some Republican leaders that a delay of Cavanaugh's vote is essentially a death sentence how did you get home I don't remember how you get there I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know three of the four key senators voting to end debate and proceed to a final vote I could not conclude that he is the right person for the court I will vote to confirm judge Kennedy the nomination of Brett M Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is confirmed senator do you think that there's still a place in the Democratic Party for you after this it's just an extraordinary person a great great talent and I think it's gonna make us all very proud and joining me now Jennifer Rubin opinion writer for The Washington Post and Josh barro business columnist for New York magazine thanks to both you for being with us Jennifer let me start with you first just thinking back here you know the over the last week or two when you had that that testimony in front of the Judiciary Committee from Christine Blasi Ford I think in that window between her testimony and when the world heard from Brett Kavanaugh I think if there was conventional wisdom that formed in that moment it was that his nomination might actually be finished what do you that it now what was key to him actually being able to get confirmed what happened what was he able to tap into what were republicans able to were able to tap into here I think Republicans have rerun their methodology from 2016 to rely on white male anger and resentment and that's what they did and they made it virtually impossible for any Republican to call himself or herself a Republican without joining in that but I actually think now that he's on the court we have a different problem much more serious and that is the question of the courts legitimacy I think his rant his partisan rant accusing unnamed Democrats of being out to get him and his threat which was what goes around comes around now poses a big problem for the court and for him specifically and we heard just last week Elena Kagan speak that she is concerned on the court she is concerned that now the United States Supreme Court which was the jewel of our legal system is viewed as simply skins and shirts read in blue that it lacks legal legitimacy and that's a problem for Congress for the courts for all of us yeah Josh I'm curious what you think of that because obviously that there was some concern about this even among potential Cavanagh of votes in the Senate supporters in the Senate it's why he put that Wall Street Journal op-ed out the night before his vote I'm thinking back to the after the 2000 election when the court decided the bush-gore election there were all the questions raised back then is it now just gonna be seen as a partisan institution the threat Jennifer is describing there how real do you think that is right now I think it's real but I think the responsibility to resolve it rests mostly with Chief Justice John Roberts rather than with Roberts is going to be the new ideological middle of the court obviously that means the court has shifted to the right compared to when that was Anthony Kennedy but Roberts has a record he's a conservative but he's also very concerned about the public sense of legitimacy for the court and he's a little bit more modest in terms of his view of how the court should operate than some of the other conservative judges he's more inclined toward recognizing precedent there's actually a decision it's not the most hot-button case there was a decision about sales tax this year wave-wave fair versus South Dakota where Roberts wrote this dissent saying the decision they were looking at when t five years ago it was a wrong decision he says but it's been standing for so long Congress could have changed it instead of the court coming in and changing this policy we should stand back and say let Congress change this if they if they don't like the previous president I think that may set a roadmap for some hot-button issues that will come before Roberts where he'll face a choice about should he join with his other conservative colleagues and overturn a long-standing precedent or should he look for a more modest road and say that we're going to defer to the legislative branch on some of these things so I think that he will will view that as a key task for him I think Cavanaugh has made his job harder because Cavanaugh has primed Democrats to even more think that conservative decisions by this court are purely political so I think that's a difficult road for Roberts to walk but I think it's going to be on him too to preserve that sense that the court is at least one or two steps removed from politics Cavanaugh is basically going to be just another conservative vote on the court as my expectation he's going to be a key vote for those conservative decisions but it's ultimately going to be up to Roberts whether they have that five vote majority in Jennifer just in terms of the the cultural division in this country I mean this was just based on the poll and this was the most polarizing Supreme Court nomination fight since Robert Bork you know 30 plus years ago Bork didn't get confirmed Cavanaugh ends up confirmed but we've talked a lot about certainly the opposition the opposition to the nomination the women's movement we've seen against Donald Trump in the last year or two have those two things sort of synched up and you've got that question of you know a female-driven movement that's already been there against Trump is that going to be accelerated by this as curious though to to hear some Republicans saying some sort of traditionally they were hearing they were saying from some traditionally Republican female voters like in suburban areas of this country who looked at this and said they looked at it from the Cavanaugh effective and said if it were my son if it were my husband who were accused of something and they didn't and they said they didn't do it and they found some sympathy there it just seems like there's there's just vast cultural divide here and how people viewed this I think that's hooey if you look at any polling data first of all that's very negative towards Cavanaugh a very negative among women very even more negative monk suburban women so I think that's wishful thinking on behalf of the Republicans but I want to go back to what Josh was saying it's not just the Supreme Court justice and I've written that column that he sort of outlined right there many a time it is up to each one of the justices it's up to I think Kavanagh to frankly recuse himself on some key cases I think it's up to all the Justice to lower the tone the tone of their opinions has become combative even personally nasty I think it behooves the justices to avoid going to clearly ideological groups and kind of cheering their side on I think they should stop commenting on politics in this regard Ruth Bader Ginsberg bears a responsibility it has to be a joint effort because I think the court is at a point in time where people will not take it seriously and we will have States and individuals testing it as Justice Kagan said last week we don't have an army we can't make people live up to our opinions and we will have some legal chaos if this goes on so it's not just Roberts it's all nine of them now and you know what if they don't do that the next time Democrats get in power we're gonna have a court packing scheme well that's and that's where we're headed for if we if they don't pull back on this rabid partisanship that's the other question Josh is does this linger in our politics and in a sense of you've had Democrats out there some talking about the idea of investigating Cavanaugh if they get some congressional power the possibility of impeaching him the possibility as Jennifer says of saying hey there's broader reforms changes to the system here do you see Democrats taking this fight and looking for specific changes to the way the judiciary is organized specifically going after Cavan at all do you see it playing out that way I mean I think there's going to be a push to impeach judge Kavanaugh but you would need a two-thirds votes in the Senate to remove him so if it was if there was a push it wouldn't lead removed from the court it would only be a political exercise the the more substantive question I think is whether Democrats when they next control the Senate and the presidency at the same time will seek to add seats to the court in order to solidify a liberal majority on the court and I think certainly the way this nomination played out makes that more likely but I think the key thing that will determine that will be the decisions that come down from this court you know I take Jennifer's point that you know it would be good for judges to project less of a political image I have also not been a fan of the way that Ginsburg and some of the other judges have been more directly involved in politics over the last few years but I think the main thing that drives that perception of public legitimacy or a legitimacy is key rulings that the court makes and so for example when they face test cases around Roe versus Wade people talk about this idea like will the court uphold or overturn Roe versus Wade a full overturning of Roe versus Wade I think would would fully outraged the the entire left and make it extremely likely that they would try court packing when they could I think a more likely outcome though is something in the middle something that weakens Roe versus Wade without overturning it and I think that's going to be key on Roberts's mind sort of how far can they go while maintaining enough political legitimacy so that they don't face court
