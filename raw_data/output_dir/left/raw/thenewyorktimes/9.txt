1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,410
Outright denials. Rogue killers.
Botched interrogations.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,520
Ever since Saudi dissident
and U.S. resident

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,070
Jamal Khashoggi’s
bizarre disappearance,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,370
the kingdom has given
all kinds of explanations

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,610
about what happened

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,730
and who is responsible.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,440
Khashoggi was last
seen on Oct. 2,

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,140
when he entered the
Saudi Consulate in Istanbul,

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,450
and apparently,
never came out.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,740
Here’s how the storyline
has changed.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,195
First, Saudi Arabia said
Khashoggi left the consulate

12
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,745
and expressed concern
about his well-being.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,510
Government-aligned Turkish media
said he was brutally murdered

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,290
by 15 Saudi hitmen.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,350
They even released
their names and images.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,780
Saudi Arabia then
started pushing back.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,440
In two statements,
it denounced

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,019
“baseless allegations”
and called them “lies.”

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,370
As the accusations
and evidence mounted,

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,440
the Saudis started getting
more forceful in their denials.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,420
And their messages
took on a threatening tone.

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,220
Like in this tweet from
the Foreign Ministry saying,

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,970
“Demise is the outcome
of these weak endeavors.”

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,900
The tweet was mysteriously
deleted the next day.

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,560
“As of this moment,
they deny it.”

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,280
When Trump said
there would be —

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,890
“And there will be
severe punishment.”

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,680
Saudi Arabia lashed out,
saying it rejected threats.

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,370
More reports
continued to come out.

30
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,190
Some of them were grisly.

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,190
“On the recordings,

32
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,730
you can hear Khashoggi
was detained when he entered,

33
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,410
killed and dismembered.

34
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,060
One official saying,
you can hear

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,480
how he was interrogated, 
tortured and murdered.”

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,550
That’s when the Saudis
seemed to be testing out

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,550
an eyebrow-raising theory and
using President Trump

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,860
to help sell it.

39
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,740
“It sounded to me like
maybe these could have been

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,150
rogue killers — who knows?”

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,040
Then, yet another twist.

42
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,210
Sources close to Saudi Arabia
started teasing the idea

43
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,380
that yes, Khashoggi was dead —

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,460
but it was because of an
interrogation gone wrong.

45
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,220
But they also continued
to maintain

46
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,210
the king and crown prince
had no knowledge of it.

47
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,330
The Saudis say
they’re investigating.

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,700
And when Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo arrived

49
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,180
in Saudi Arabia,

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,390
there were smiles
and pleasantries.

51
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,760
It looked like
business as usual.

52
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,340
But after the
head-spinning stories

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,870
about a suspected gory murder
by a key U.S. ally,

54
00:02:34,870 --> 00:00:00,000
it was anything but.
