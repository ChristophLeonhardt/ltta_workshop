overturn her death penalty conviction 19 year old neuter Hussein has been sentenced to death for killing her husband after he allegedly raped her now international groups including the UN are asking the Sudanese government to spare her life notice story has generated outcry online and is being shared with the hashtag justice for new romp and save Noura so today we want to talk about neuters case and the challenges Sudanese women and girls face while seeking justice for sexual violence you can join our live conversation via youtube or on twitter at aj stream and we reached out to the Sudanese government to join our program but they said they could not comment on an ongoing court case so with us on set is Mohammed sayfudine a lawyer who has been keeping in contact with notas legal team he's also a member of the group justice for nuda in Nairobi Natori Naya moma thangai a program officer with the group equality now she is a human rights lawyer and an advocate of the High Court of Kenya knobhead kibriyaa is director of the Sudan Base Seema Centre for training and protection of women and child rights and in Kampala halal Carib a Sudanese activist for women's rights she is a regional director of the strategic initiative for women in the Horn of Africa welcome to the stream everyone I want to start here on set Mohammed you pitch this show to us on Instagram actually when did you first hear of nudists story and what was it that made you decide to get involved in her campaign well thank you for having us I've heard of no story when it came through some of our members here in DC was brought to our attention from someone in Sudan and then we found that the act is unconscionable because we have sisters and nieces and nephews and we wanted to make sure that this is the last straw we wanted to shed light on the issue so it doesn't happen to someone else so that's why we pitched a show and we just wanted to shed light on it and make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else so as we mentioned this story of course has made waves internationally and which is why we're talking about it here in Washington DC and the hashtag has gone all over the world but for those who aren't as aware of the details of Nora's case give us a brief explanation on what happened and how we got to where we are today indeed so Nora's was 16 years old when she was betrothed to a man that she was not interested in and she refused when a way to stay with her and then when she turned 19 she was told to come back under the marriage was off only to find out that the marriage has been arranged and she was forced into the marriage against her will when she refused to consummate the marriage with her alleged husband she was forced with the help of allegedly some of his family members when he tried to have intercourse with her again the following day she defended herself and the men passed away and therefore she was turned in to the authorities a trial was held and she was convicted of murder for defending herself so it's a tough situation that she found herself in and it's a breaking but really it breaks a lot of people hearts to hear something like that a woman doesn't have the opportunity or the ability to protect herself or integrity of her body now had one of the things I found most striking about this case is that she was forced into marriage at 16 and decided she didn't want that so she went into hiding she ran away from home this is a tweet we got from someone else who found that striking is well what that says most girls and smaller villages do not realize that they have the opportunity to choose the age of marriage nor the person so people are making note of the fact that she wasn't even in a big city she wasn't in Khartoum the capital she was in a village and decided this wasn't the life she wanted for herself what was it that you found most striking about her story the most is that I can't think that she defend herself Nora is one of 30 7% of girls and women in Sudan who got married before the age of 18 and it is important to mention here that the ends of marriage in Sudan is only 10 according to article 4 of the Sudan family law 1990 so it is it is a legal marriage to get married as it is but what is absent here is the acceptance is a question about the legality of the age of the marriage while the Sudanese law does say tender there's a conflict within the law itself because Sudan is a member of the African Commission on Human and people's right which article 6 says that the age of marriage is 18 but it also requires full consent so by Sudan becoming a member of that particular Commission that law automatically becomes part of Sudan unless sometimes there's some Commission yes actually Sudan had the reservation on the Arctic in that ban marriage of children of the African Charter and this is very important that Sudan is contradicting it c-stands not with the International original human rights document but even with the Constitution correct and that now we have this contradiction so then has the reservation on this article of the African character and of course that the age of marriage is contradicting with the tribe the Sudanese right no in itself when we said it is a legal age we build on the on the law but it is not it is not there are exact respect and in harmony with the human rights Sudan obligations other humans are also the human rights oudin obligations like the CRC is a child and it is important that even with this bad law the absence of consent is the an important issue that important point that this marriage is not is not legal according to that so that is those the other things she is not refusing only the man Nora and I heard this from her personally her is that is not only again it's a man she she was refusing the issue of marriage you chill she insist to continue her education and that is why she is kept a go away and it is important also here to mention she is kept only for two days not for three years I met I met Nora so there is some confusion in the common stories that now people are telling it's a good point here well you know these international and conventions are very important the reservation is really a point that a lot of these countries make and therefore the convention themselves become meaningless that's why there needs to be a movement from within the country inside and I think that's what the group just as for Nora is trying to do taking the narrative back to Sudanese community itself and the changes coming from the bottom up first of all now thank you so much for clarifying on the amount of time that she was away from home because I think there is a lot of misinformation out there and you have talked to her yourself you are a valuable asset to this conversation I wanted to just pause this there before we get too deep into the legal aspects of this case to remind us about some of the things that happened that led to this so this is a tweet we got from William William unfortunately is not alone there are several people who are saying what William is saying he says this is sad but what actions did she take to denounce this act before taking away a human life a lot of people are saying she committed a crime here natori I want to bring you in here with this because I know your organization is advising the legal team a noonas legal team what are they doing about this sentiment because people in Sudan are saying this as well Nitori exactly what what people are not looking at these are the prevailing circumstances that led to this situation Nora had clearly see that she doesn't want to get married she was forcing to eat and event to make matters was her rights were further violated she was pinned down by the male members of her husband's family and they raped her and she resisted these several times and she kept on saying that she doesn't want to be in this marriage and even my biggest question is can we even call this a marriage because I don't think it's a marriage in the first place she was forced into it she did not consent into it and over and over again she was very clear on what her stand was so this is an analogy in my opinion that this marriage never took place and that's why we cannot even talk about marital rape this was outside tree rape and also there's also the element of gang grip when militant members of her husband's family come in pin her down that that's a very heinous crime and as equality now one of the things that we are calling on is a dropping of all criminal charges against Nora because Nora is not a criminal she is a victim mm-hmm someone who would agree with you were fat here and I hear you holla and I'll go to you with this what if I hear what it agree she says I would love to see this as a movement for child marriage women's oppression and women's rights we are all Nora what did you want to add to that hala what I would like to add it the whole situation that happens to Nora Hart victimization and the fact that you know you know she she got into this situation is due to the discriminatory nature of Sudan legal system which is has this tendency whether it's a it's a family it's a personal status law or if it's Sudan criminal criminal act both of them are they have this tendency to criminalize and to fundamentally discriminate against women and what what now it has said in terms of the family law and the whole issue of the age of of child marriage and and as of out of the age of 10 you know and then the whole issue of the fact that the Sudanese family is still enforcing the concepts on and the practice of guardianship that means the girls can be represented by her but by the male guardians of her family all these factors together enabled this situation to happen and Buettner in this in this in this critical situation and I definitely agree with Natalia I think it's absolutely hundred-percent a self defense case it was very clear the amendment in the Sudan criminal act that took place in January 2015 speaks clearly to that you know that if you are Bhutan a position or and status you know where you are exposed to rape regardless of you are married to the person or not you and you have to defend yourself you are not to be criminalized for for that act but fundamentally if there is no actual change you know that that is going to happen with incident criminal act and Sudan personal status law you know this type of situation and and and you know victimization not only flora but also of of the disease you know of of the man who tried to force her to to marry him so I I hear what you're saying I hear at all our guests are saying and yet yeah I just want to bring this up because this is an opposing view and I can't wait to hear what you guys think about it but this is purest on Twitter he says a husband cannot rape a wife that is an actual fact we got several tweets like that I just pulled that one because I'm trying to spare us all so this is one person's perspective this is a response we got on Twitter Mohammed I'll share this with you this is Allah this is what he told the stream let's make something clear marital rape is rape I don't understand why it is considered as a much lesser crime than rape by a stranger for example just because it is committed by the husband Nora saying from Sudan was forced to have sex with her husband many times with the assistance of his family meaning she was raped it does not matter if she was raped by her husband by a stranger by a friend it is called rape it doesn't matter so why does a case like this even exist what's the legal framework that allows marital rape to exist well the legal frame there's a discussion whether it was a religious one or as a culture well let me tell you straight ahead that it's not a religious one there are many foot was out there that exclusively say consent is absolutely required for marriage so it's not a religious one what's happening is who then because the Soudan history there is this mixture of religion culture but I think it's also a political philosophy that's implemented in the law now with the changes that happen in 2015 it was changed the definition was changed it was broadened out from exclusively you know when it it now changed where it says that intercourse without consent is rape regardless of the relationship so actually when I spoke with North lawyers just last night this issue was brought up and I think they did make that argument during the trial but it didn't work I think they need to be and I think the problem lies in the definition of marriage within Sudan personal status law one the the amendment of 2015 I'm talking about that those who are actually saying that marital rape does not exist you know that the husband has the right you know to have sex with his wife at any point of time whether she consented to that or not you know I think that actually you know it's it's generated based on the definition of marriage you know in Sudan personal status she speaks yeah which is P clearly says you know that it knows the definition of marriage in to the fact that you know marriage is allowing a man to enjoy you know having sex with with his wife that's it so the constantia was I think that is but yes I really beg to differ in cases of human rights where do we draw inspiration from we draw it from international standards from International Human Rights instrument Sudan is a state party to various international instruments including their African chatter on the rights and the welfare of a child it has made reservations but on such cases that's where we should anchor such issues and I think that's generally the norm we want student to accept the international norms and that's what we're pushing for but we have to deal with the reality of the case where we are and the issues in Sudan themself and the people in the ground now just let me give you an example here assume that the government intervenes here what we have we might revert to this tribalism blood for blood thing so I think it's it's important to be mindful of other people involving the case and how Sudan operates internally so when we have these international organizations that don't fully understand the culture how it may impact the culture internally I think that's a bit irresponsible while we agree that it's not right it shouldn't happen we have to be mindful of that also there's still a chance that we can sell iation within the families how to finish up your point and now here from unit or I go ahead hala you know Human Rights has to take into consideration the context you know where the Human Rights frameworks have been applied and Sudan is a predominantly Muslim country and there is majority Muslim countries around the world who actually managed to reform their legal framework based on moderate and okay actually I'm gonna drive here hello I hear your point there and and I love the enthusiasm and the passion here you mentioned religious framework I want to play a video comment from a religious leader here in you and the u.s. but he is of Sudanese descent Sudanese background his from Sudan this is Imam Muhammad Majid and here's what he told this dream marriage in Islam is a very important contract that you will sign and the world have ensued into this marriage contract voluntary when I hear about some of you forced to get married and then we violated when I'm being forced to consummate the marriage I really get upset only but I think that the community around them should accept that it absolute shock because in Islam there's no compulsion in any way and therefore that every young lady that here in this should understand from some perspective a woman I have a full right to reject any proposal her parents were given her so you heard that you heard that perspective there I promised her Tori I would get tonight I promised Ana Tori I would go to her and that's already go ahead yes exactly I just want to correct something we are we are not we are not in this disregard of the laws of the Republic of Sudan we are not when we are looking at the legal reforms when we are looking at the legal reforms we cannot keep on referring to what to the laws that hurry to impressive we have to draw inspiration from from elsewhere even in the appeal that is going on of course the laws that will be used at the laws in the Republic of Sudan that's what abiding but that does not does not make us not to look at other international know I like your head but I want us to all remember why we're all here just one moment I wants to remember why we're here and and this is a person who's sitting in she's not even 20 yet and is sitting in a Sudanese prison because she was allegedly raped twice by the person that she didn't want to marry so I want us to remember her we're talking about the laws and that's really important when we talk about whether or not there can be legal reform but I want to take it back to her just for a second because there's this changed org petition I'll go to you with this now head justice for Nora it has nearly a million signatures and it was started by someone of Sudanese descent but someone who is in France so clearly there is worldwide appeal it's also reached some pretty high profile figures this is my Yomi Campbell the supermodel she says I know Yomi Campbell urged the Sudanese government to pardon rape victim Noura Hussain and show the world that women who are brutally raped are the real victims now had you spoken to her does she know about the International Campaign to free her and and what does she think of it how is her mental state right now yeah but before coming to this point I would like to mention that what happened to Nora is worse than the loss because solo Sudanese law is the openly said that the concept is is the corner of the meteorite married so the problem is not only with zelo's is the knowledge about derides about shallows and the other thing is the law enforcement people is the fearsome blue didn't get the right legal yeah it is important that what happened to Nora is actually even with Sudanese law is illegal what happened to Nora is injustice even with this bad Sudanese laws and it is very important that regarding Sandy Nora Nora here is a young brave woman and she is very strong and he is sad and I think I met her many times but it's important I met her before the sentence and of course after the court decision she knew that the sentence will be death penalty and we were a lot of people played role in preparing her for this sentence and it is not last the end that we will continue supporting her when she came to the court she was strong and even she was smiling and the strength it was in her face after the sentence when I met her in town in the prison she was shackled it was very shocking for me finding her walking in these heavy chains the boy the sound of the kids is actually reflecting strong and bad message about her suffering but he still was she knew thank you guys it was good to hear this you can see this hashtag has has a place for it I wanted to realize comment we just got on YouTube mystery Knight says if they execute her they are saying that women have no rights and have nowhere to turn when their rights are violated Mohammed what are her legal options right now okay about a minute left right so legal option that can be a reconciliation between the family are Nora and then they appeal once the appeal happens there are several options the court can overturn the sentence they can send him back to the trial court or they can accept the original conviction and then her lawyers would appeal to the Supreme Court and I spoke with them yesterday they're willing to do that just an important point that I wanted to bring up with respect to the Barton pardoning power I spoke with the lawyer yesterday and he said that the president in this particular circumstances cannot pardon Nora so her only options are either the family reconciliation or the court itself so that's why it's very important to be sensitive to the culture not just the law so that newer can have justice and have the chance to get out of the situation that she's in but again and the lawyers tell me that the pardon power does not fall with the president within this particular circumstances which is a very important point to bring to the international spark something there and this is a conversation that Orson at the end of it I'm so sorry ladies and I'm and I'm sorry to have to end us there it's all the time that we have with this part of the conversation it can continue online hashtag need a stream and hashtag justice renew des in with this tweet from Mary who says thank you for bringing awareness I was drawn deeply to nudists plight I had to act and we held a support rally for her my 12 year old is very concerned and is worried about Nora please do all you can to help people connect and make a difference and that's coming to us from Salt Lake City Utah thanks for being with us you
