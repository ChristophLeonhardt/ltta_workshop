1
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:03,323
COULD BE A BIG FLOP FOR

2
00:00:03,323 --> 00:00:04,124
REPUBLICANS.

3
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:06,493
WE BEGIN WITH HILLARY.

4
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:07,828
>> HI, NEIL.

5
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:10,063
NATIONAL DEMOCRATS TELL ME THIS

6
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:11,865
CALIFORNIA PRIMARY IS MAKE OR

7
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:12,432
BREAK.

8
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:14,968
VOTING IS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW IN

9
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,703
HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA.

10
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:18,272
ONE OF THE DISTRICTS DEMOCRATS

11
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:19,473
POURED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO.

12
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:22,609
THEY HAVE BEEN COUNTING ON A

13
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:25,245
BLUE WAVE HITTING CALIFORNIA TO

14
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,447
ADD TO THEIR TALLY OF SEATS.

15
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:29,149
NATIONAL DEMOCRATS TELL ME

16
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:32,185
THEY'RE WORRIED THEY COULD BE

17
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,721
LEFT OFF THE BALLOT ENTIRELY.

18
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:38,425
THE DCCC HAS HAD TO DUMB

19
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:40,127
MILLIONS IN RACES AND ASK

20
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,461
CANDIDATES TO GET OUT.

21
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,630
STILL, THEY'RE WORRIED IT WON'T

22
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,365
BE ENOUGH.

23
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:47,768
THEY'RE TARGETED TEN SEATS IN

24
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:48,435
THE RACE.

25
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:51,905
TWO ARE RETIRING.

26
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:53,307
DARRELL ISSA AND ED ROYCE.

27
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:55,042
AND THEY'RE TARGETING TWO SEATS

28
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,944
THAT REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO

29
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,946
HOLD ON TO.

30
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:03,583
CONGRESSMAN WARBACKER AND MIMI

31
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:03,917
WALTERS.

32
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:06,253
THESE FOUR DISTRICTS VOTED FOR

33
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,088
HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016.

34
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:08,989
DEMOCRATS SAW AN ADVANTAGE TO

35
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:10,524
USE IN 2018.

36
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:12,292
>> I'M UP AGAINST TWO

37
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:13,860
MILLIONAIRES AND WE KNOW THERE'S

38
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,429
BILLIONAIRES THAT ARE FINANCING

39
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:17,230
MOST OF WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC

40
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,664
PARTY DOES.

41
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:20,100
SO THE PUBLIC WILL WAKE UP TO

42
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,400
THAT.

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,169
IT'S NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF

44
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:25,305
HARD WORKING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT

45
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:28,909
SOME POLITICAL CLIQUE THAT IS

46
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,811
TRYING TO BASICALLY CONTROL THE

47
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,147
STATE AND CONTROL THEIR LIVES.

48
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:35,549
I'M CONFIDENT AND THE REPUBLICAN

49
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,451
PARTY IS ABOUT READY TO SURGE

50
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:40,153
BACK IN CALIFORNIA AS COMPARED

51
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:43,090
TO THIS BLUE WAVE THAT WE'RE

52
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,192
BEING TOLD IS COMING.

53
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:51,231
>> HERE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH,

54
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:56,169
SCOTT BAH IS CLOSE FRIENDS WITH

55
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,671
ROYBACKER BUT HE'SES WILL

56
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:58,638
FIGHTING FOR HIS SEAT.

57
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,874
HE SAID IF THE TWO FACE OFF IN

58
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:01,975
NOVEMBER THAT WOULD LEAVE

59
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:05,045
DEMOCRATS OFF THE BALLOT

60
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:05,479
ENTIRELY.

61
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,382
>> YOUR CHALLENGING A FELLOW

62
00:02:08,382 --> 00:02:08,782
REPUBLICAN.

63
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:11,050
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW DO

64
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,654
YOU THINK THAT ACTUALLY HELPS

65
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,523
REPUBLICANS ON PRIMARY DAY?

66
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,191
>> IF THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TWO

67
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:19,626
IN THE PLAYOFFS, TWO IN THE

68
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:21,395
GENERAL ELECTION, IT MEANS THIS

69
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,430
SEAT IS REMOVED FROM THE

70
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,232
DEMOCRAT CALCULATION ALTOGETHER.

71
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,366
THEY CAN'T WIN THE SEAT BECAUSE

72
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,734
THEY DON'T HAVE A CANDIDATE IN

73
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:30,704
THE GENERAL ELECTIONS.

74
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:33,974
>> A DEMOCRATIC LOCK-OUT COULD

75
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:35,842
BE A HUGE NIGHTMARE FOR NANCY

76
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:37,811
PELOSI WHO SAID THE PATHWAY FOR

77
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,513
VICTORY RUNS THROUGH CALIFORNIA.

78
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:41,448
I TALKED TO DEMOCRATIC

79
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:42,249
CANDIDATES THAT THEY HAVE HAND

80
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:45,052
PICKED AND THEY'RE NOT READY TO

81
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:47,254
VOCALIZE THEIR SUPPORT FOR A

82
00:02:47,254 --> 00:00:00,000
POTENTIAL SPEAKER PELOSI RUN IN
