“There is a viable opposition
to the rule of the ayatollahs.
And that opposition is
centered in this room today.”
That’s John Bolton.
He’s speaking at
the annual gathering
of an Iranian dissident group
known as the Mujahedeen Khalq,
or the M.E.K.
Bolton has long been
vehemently opposed
to the Iran nuclear deal
and to having dialogue
with the Iranian government.
“The behavior and the
objectives of the regime
are not going to change.
And therefore, the only solution
is to change the regime itself.
And that’s why, before 2019,
we here will
celebrate in Tehran.
Thank you very much.”
Bolton believes the M.E.K.
is a viable alternative
to Iran’s government.
So what is the M.E.K.?
It’s a dissident group
and its primary mission
is to overthrow
the regime in Iran.
A 2011 State Department
estimate said
the group had between
5,000 to 13,000 members.
Most M.E.K. members
are Iranian exiles
living in Europe and the U.S.
Many experts believe
it has little support
inside Iran itself.
They often stage demonstrations
against Iran’s human rights record
and its cleric-run state.
It’s often described as a cult.
The U.S. State Department says
it calls for forcing spouses
to divorce and weekly
ideological cleansing sessions.
It was led by Massoud Rajavi,
but he’s been missing since 2003,
and so his wife, Maryam Rajavi,
has become the de facto leader.
Until 2012, the United States 
considered it a terrorist organization.
M.E.K.’s tactics have
shifted over the years.
But it has been known to use
violence to achieve its goals.
M.E.K. started in Iran
in the 1960s.
In the 1970s, it carried out
anti-regime activities
against the shah,
right up until the
Islamic Revolution in 1979.
And then, it targeted
Ayatollah Khomeini’s
government, too.
But it didn’t stop there.
During this time it
was also suspected
to be behind the
assassination of six Americans
and the bombings of
American companies in Iran.
The group eventually
moved to Iraq
and tried to destabilize the
Iranian regime from there.
But after Saddam Hussein was toppled,
the country grew too
dangerous for them,
even with U.S. troops present.
“M.E.K. was still a pretty
undesirable group.
But we did not want to watch
it be slaughtered in Iraq.”
Today, Bolton isn’t
the only public figure
to find common
cause with the M.E.K.
Rudy Giuliani,
former D.N.C. chair Ed Rendell
and Trump Transportation
Secretary Elaine Chao
have spoken at or attended
M.E.K.’s national conference.
The group also has an
aggressive lobbying arm
and seems to have
deep pockets.
“The amusing thing
is that the M.E.K.
will try to buy
pretty much anyone:
You know, I was approached
to do events
in support of the M.E.K.
I know a number of other
former government officials
who found them
truly detestable
also were approached.
You know,
it’s really something
to have someone
on the phone offering you
$15,000 or $20,000 to appear
at a panel discussion,
because that doesn’t happen
for former diplomats every day.”
Since he became
national security adviser,
Bolton hasn’t said who he’d like
to see take over in Iran.
But if past statements
are any guide,
M.E.K’s most powerful advocate
is now within earshot
of the president.
“I have said for over 10 years
since coming to these events
that the declared policy of
the United States of America
should be the overthrow of
the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.”
