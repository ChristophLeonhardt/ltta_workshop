as per the usual arrangement on Sunday Republicans reached a deal with Democrats to pass a 1.1 trillion dollar spending bill that will avoid a government shutdown through September here's what's in the bill funding for Planned Parenthood Obamacare Iran deal the National Endowment for the Arts and sanctuary cities here's what's not in the bill funding for Trump's planned border wall incredibly the new omnibus even includes a measure to increase the influx of temporary workers under h-2b visas through September but at least Republicans raised military spending right that's the take from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan who has a bad habit of pulling such gills off with Democratic help in 2013 Ryan cut a deal with Senator patty Murray Democrat of Washington to raise sequestration caps cut cost-of-living adjustment for veterans increased taxes and do so in exchange for empty promises of future cuts on this bill Ryan brags quote we have boosted resources for our defense needs without corresponding increases in non-defense spending of course Republicans run both houses of Congress this time and President Trump is in the White House but no matter the dreaded government shutdown has been avoided for the time being even the defense increases by the way are about half of what Trump wanted Republicans caved again they were elected to overturn Obamacare they haven't and they won't even the supposed plan vote this week on Obamacare repeal does not repeal Obamacare it were elected to build Trump's border wall they haven't there are no immediate plans to do so they were elected to fund Planned Parenthood they haven't as bloomberg points out quote overall the compromise resembles more of an Obama administration era budget than a trump one the National Institutes of Health for example which he a two billion dollar boost reflecting the popularity of medical research among lawmakers the deal includes nine hundred ninety million dollars for famine aid along with a 1.1 billion dollar boost for disaster recovery funds more than 70 anti environmental policy riders in the bill were defeated no wonder Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said quote this agreement is a good agreement for the American people and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table you know also like the deal Nancy Pelosi Trump is now preparing to push forward the new health care plan which doesn't repeal Obama care his aides say he's going to push for a massive infrastructure spending plan sometime in the next two or three weeks Barack Obama would be proud of the Republicans I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so if all that sounds depressing just wait for the rest of the show but actually we will be getting to the White House Correspondents Dinner which was it just demonstrates that Trump's luck definitely extends to his opponents because his opponents are the dumbest people alive the journalists at the White House Correspondents Dinner made complete fools of themselves before we get to that I want to say thank you to our advertisers over at ring comm so most of the burglaries that happen in the United States happen in broad daylight with a burglar ringing your doorbell to see if you're home and then once they know your way then they break into the house well the ring video doorbell means that when they ring your doorbell and instead of going to your house it also goes to your phone that means you can pick up you can say I'm at home what do you want you can see who it is at your door ring video doorbell has been proven to stop burglaries before they happen by allowing you to see and speak with anyone approaching your door using your smartphone now they have their advanced motion detection technology to protect your entire property that's called the ring of security kit which includes that ring video doorbell I talked about we have one installed at our home we have the ring stick up cam it's a wireless weatherproof HD camera to keep an eye on the other parts of your property it is imperative if you're worried about home security to get ring okay ring calm / spend $150 off that ring of security kit ring calm / Ben my wife is constantly afraid of a home break-in I'm afraid of home breaking because I'm public figure and so that's why we have ring comm also gives us the ability to see who's at the front gate before we allow anybody to come on to the property as opposed to just an audio doorbell ring calm so I spend $150 off that ring of security kit and again it's ring calm / been joined millions of people who already use ring calm to protect their home terrific product okay so the White House Correspondents Dinner happens over the weekend and this was from triumphant moment because well the White House Correspondents Dinner is going on this is happening apparently on what was a Saturday night and it was happening this is at the same time this is happening President Trump was giving a massive rally in Pennsylvania which is really smart it's really smart and it's really funny he is a rally at the same time mocking the members of the press and we'll start with the members of the press who made asses of themselves for eight years they disappeared Obama just was a good guy why do we need to watch this guy there's no reason we need to watch this Obama fellow and then Trump comes back into power and Republicans are back in power and suddenly they've awoken like the money they have awoken from their sleep and they've come to revenge themselves on all things Trump so it started with Will Ferrell's showing up at the White House Correspondents Dinner again whereas Will Ferrell the last eight years doing political comedy know where he played Bush and then he disappeared because all of the political comedians just decided it was no longer important to actually do political comedy for eight years because Obama was just such a magnificent fellow well now Will Ferrell is back imitating Bush and this time Democrats are doing the revisionist history where they say yeah we wish we had Bush back because Trump is so terrible if you recall they said the same thing about Reagan with Bush so every time there's a Republican president they say the last Republican president was so awesome we missed that guy so here's Will Ferrell doing that routine George W Bush how do you like me now yeah the prodigal son has returned you guys are always sneak up on me with gotcha questions like why are we going to war got you why did you not respond to Hurricane Katrina got you what is your middle name gotcha this is the whole routine they did with Bush how stupid he was had terrible he was again Obama was president for eight years did anybody in the media ask him why did you go to war in Syria gotcha no nobody asked him that question because instead of going to war in Syria are doing anything about Syria he handed over to the Russians nobody asked Barak Obama about what he was doing at any time during his presidency even though he was a horrible president but Will Ferrell is back and it's like the Republicans never left power isn't that wonderful that wasn't the most offensive part White House Correspondents Dinner host Hassan min Hajj they brought out his Muslim comedian that nobody's ever heard of because obviously we need a Muslim comedian not because he's talented because he isn't but because if he's Muslim then it shows that Republicans hate Muslims if they criticize him so here is here is Hasan Minhaj blasting Trump it's not bad that he's Muslim by the way it's bad that he's a crappy comedian here he is you know a lot of people told me his song if you go after the administration it would be petty unfair and childish in other words presidential here we go I get why Donald Trump didn't want to be roasted tonight by the looks of them he's been roasting non-stop for the past 70 years historically the president usually performs at the Correspondents Dinner but I think I speak for all of us when I say he's done far too much bombing this month now a lot of people in the media say that Donald Trump goes golfing too much that's always like he goes golfing too much which raises a very important question why do you care do you want to do do you want to know what he's not doing when he's golfing being president let the man putt putt keep him distracted teach him how to play Batman tell him he has a great body for bobsledding playing tic-tac-toe the longer you keep him distracted the longer we're not at war with North Korea every time Donald Trump goes golfing the headlights should read Trump golfing apocalypse delayed take the W this is great I love this even if you guys groan I've already hired Kelly and Conway she's gonna go on TV on Monday and tell everybody I killed so it really doesn't matter but I love I love that everybody's drinking having a good time this is beautiful you know Donald Trump doesn't drink right does not touch alcohol which is oddly respectable let's think about that that means every statement every interview every tweet completely sober how is that possible okay so he does I can't imagine why Trump didn't show up for this and I can't imagine why people thought this guy was terrible oh maybe it's because he's awful I mean just by any objective measure he's awful at this at least he can say that Will Ferrell is a talented guy I don't know where they dug this guy up but this guy would have bombed and like the local comedy club and they put him up in front of the entire nation and he's supposed to be roasting Trump and then of course everybody in love said he destroyed Trump note Trump still president just ridiculous and then Samantha B got the most obnoxious person on cable television she's in a running gun fight with Trevor Noah and amy schumer and lena dunham to be the least funny person in America and Amy Schumer gets up and she salutes the press because if there's anybody who needs saluting it's the press that wrongly covered this election that wrongly covered President Obama that wrongly covered President Bush and that is now feeding itself for being the greatest people on planet earth Hera Samantha be the least funny woman in America I give her the title narrowly over Amy Schumer here she goes much as I might love poking fun at the media and as much as you all kind of deserve it sometimes I know your job has never been harder POTUS has convinced 88% of his fans that you're an enemy of the people you basically get paid to stand in a cage while a geriatric orangutan and his pit mob scream at you it's like a reverse zoo but you carry on you dig up misdeeds and fraud by the powerful you expose injustice against the weak and you continue to fact-check the president as if he might someday get embarrassed tonight is for you tonight the president screams at a pen that K teacher is not in tears okay so they're toasting themselves because nothing says in touch with the people cares about to me to the people like people wearing thousand-dollar suits and toasting each other for doing basic journalism which they ignored for the past eight years and then the White House Correspondents Association president got up there and lambasted Trump to again remember these are the journalists right these are the people who are supposed to be honestly covering this administration do they think they're going to convince anybody anyone in America that they are not just hateful spiteful angry people against President of the United States and they do stuff like this or Jeff Mason of Reuters who's ahead of WHCA we cannot ignore the rhetoric that has been employed by the president about who we are and what we do freedom of the press is a building block of our democracy undermining that by seeking to D legitimate journalists is dangerous to a healthy Republic so where was this guy when Barack Obama was sticking the DOJ on The Associated Press where was he when when the when brocco bomb was directly attacking Fox News and taqueria where was he when Barack Obama was using the DOJ to target Fox News is James Rosen and by the way actually prosecute journalists I mean prosecute a buncha journalists for supposedly where was he he was gone right so for eight years it was as though Barack Obama wasn't president it just disappeared from memory there's a line in Field of Dreams in which a very lucky character gets up and talks about how there was Eisenhower Republicans there was Eisenhower and then there was there was there what was it he said something like there was three terms of Nixon and then there was just skipped right onto Reagan's hip the Carter years or skipped the Nixon years or whatever it was okay that's actually what Democrats do they think that there were two terms of Bush and then eight years just disappeared down the toilet and then there was Trump they just went straight from Bush to Trump Obama didn't exist in the middle and then the capper of all of the Samantha be again the least funny person woman in America she gets up there on CNN and she's asked as though she's a serious person on State of the Union Jake Tapper who I generally like his report a per ask Samantha B what she thinks of the current state of the country and she says she dropped this aw inspiringly stupid line Hillary Clinton's semantics me no you did did you I don't know flattering I didn't know that there was a Samantha bee problem but let me read part of it to you the Democratic Party's problem in the age of Trump isn't really Jimmy Fallon who you had criticized and others who criticized for being too soft them from it's probably Samantha bee not be alone of course but the entire phenomenon the she embodies the rapid colonization of new cultural territory by an ascendant social liberalism first what's your response and second of all how does it feel to be you know the face of the problem oh my god my name was in an article um it's me it's not racism it's just me no you know what I'll pay for all I'll wait for all that evidence to roll in and then all then I'll make up my mind after that just because there was no backup it was just you know it's one person's opinion but it wonderful lap one wonderful is a meson action but let me ask you let me ask you a question does he have a larger butt and you've addressed this on your show so remove yourself from it does he have a point about smug liberals I'm not talking about you by debate but does but is there a smug liberal but I know that is something that I can't really I mean I can't take responsibility for the way the election turnout I just absolutely don't know wrong I can't is there as much you told announcing I guess I'm s you know I don't I don't think there is like I do the show for me and for people like me and I don't really care how the rest of the world sees it quite there's no mug liberal problem I do the show for people like me and people like me but there's no smug liberal problem I don't care what the rest of the world thinks there's no smug liberal problem you just described the smug liberal problem you do a show for you and people like you and you don't care what anybody else things because you think that you are the repository of all knowledge wisdom and decency in the United States but there's no smug liberal problem no what we have here is a smug liberal comedienne self-aware in its problem that's what we have here and this is the problem with the left and this is why Trump is so ever-loving lucky he's the luckiest man in America because the left is so smug the left is so terrible and they can't even see it themselves so Trump goes out there any campaigns and he's talking to people he thinks are sort of the Forgotten people the people that Samantha B just said she doesn't care about they don't watch her show you know those people Trump talks to those people then he says look at that smug liberal in every goes yeah you know why because he's right because they are smug leftists that is a smug leftist she is awful she's sitting there in her expensive clothing on an expensive set with Jake Tapper and before that not an expensive set at the White House Correspondents Dinner with the people who are the repositories of knowledge remember when reporters in the old movies they used to be people who are like the battered Derby hats and they were the men of the streets he changed smoked and then went out there and they reported on things that were happening on the ground now they go to the White House Correspondents Dinner and there were tails in a tie and Samantha bee wears her very fancy suit and they go out there and they jabber about how what wonderful people they are they become celebrities in their own right and this is what Trump hit I want to get through Trump's response because it was top notch Trump in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our

the White House Correspondents Dinner with this rally very smart he ignores all of the journalists feeding each other and patting each other on the back and he was just going to go there and they were going to make fun of him and there were going to be pictures of him looking sour so smart of him to skip it I think it's a dumb event and so instead he went to this rally and here is him knocking the media a large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media our consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now and that is why people like Trump in a nutshell that is why people like Trump and people also like Trump because Trump is on Face the Nation over the weekend and here is Donald Trump catering to his crowd by basically ripping on John Dickerson who is the host of Face the Nation you know it's very funny when the fake media goes at you know which we called the mainstream media which sometimes I must say is you for when the make me personally or your show I love your show I call if T Face the Nation but you know your show is sometimes not exactly correct and everybody on the right loves us of course as well they should because the media are a bunch of leftist trolls who hate President Trump and hate the right now the reason the left is scared of Trump is because something Reince Priebus said over the weekend here's Reince Priebus talking about how the White House considered the changing and changing libel law changing the First Amendment of the Constitution this is why the left looks at people like us you know people who say look the media is full of it and they say why aren't you scared of Trump - I mean Trump is the one talking about changing the First Amendment Ange the libel laws that would require as I understand it a constitutional amendment is he really going to pursue that is that something he wants to pursue I think it's something that we've looked at and how that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere it's a different story but when you have articles out there that have no basis or fact and we're sitting here on 24/7 cable companies writing stories about constant contacts with Russia and all these other matters I think the president should be overall soother attaching stories I think I think that I think that newspapers and news agencies need to be more responsible with how they report the news I believe that part is true of course newspapers and news agency should be more responsible but this idea that you're going to revise the First Amendment that does scare people and it should scare people because if Barack Obama we're saying it everybody on the right would be going nuts again this is my shoe on the other foot test if Reince Priebus right now we're rahm emanuel and who are saying the same things we should be happy or would you be sad today and the answer is you would be sad today because this is not something the president should be saying but this is something I want a little bit more about
