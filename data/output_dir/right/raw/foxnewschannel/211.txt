23
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:49,668
THIS GREAT NEWS CAN MEAN ONE

24
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:51,637

THAT'S A REAL HEADLINE.

37
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:18,564
APPARENTLY MULLER WOULD DRY GLUE

38
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:21,400
AND EAT IT.

39
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,401
MULLER WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER

00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,812
THEIR BEHAVIOR IS SO IRRATIONAL

62
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:07,279
IT'S PERMITTED.

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,014
ASK THE PANTSUIT.

64
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,215
>> YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH A

65
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,251
POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO

00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:13,352
DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR AND

67
00:02:13,353 --> 00:02:15,454

68
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:20,759
GREG: THAT IS FUNNY.

69
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,927
I DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER HER

70
00:02:21,928 --> 00:02:22,928

00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:31,203
TO LECTURE US ON CIVILITY?

74
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,705
HER PARTY JUST RUINED A MAN AND

GOING ON A TOUR TOGETHER.

81
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:45,784
SHE WANTS TO MAKE MONEY AND HE

82
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:47,419
WANTS TO MAKE IT TO THE R IN HIS

83
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,920

[LAUGHTER]

85
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,424

[LAUGHTER]

90
00:02:57,364 --> 00:03:02,601

MATH.

95
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:15,681
NOW, IT'S ABOUT WHICH SIDE IS

96
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:16,115
MORE UNCIVIL.

97
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:17,149

103
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:22,488
FIRST, THE LEFT.

104
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,722

TO DEFEND THIS MOB THAT THEY'RE

379
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:22,027
COMPELLED TO JUMP IN AND THEY

380
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:24,596
ARE ON THE PARTISAN SIDE.

381
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:28,400
GREG: THEY ARE NOT MODERATING.

382
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:29,167
>> IT IS CRAZY.

383
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:33,405
[APPLAUSE]

384
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:34,406
GREG: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

385
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:35,674
TEACHER BUT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

386
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:36,007
THE MOP?

387
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:39,611
KAT: CAN DISCUSS WHATEVER YOU

388
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:39,911
WANT.

389
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:40,579
I AM VERY VERSATILE.

390
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,746
GREG: SURPRISINGLY.

391
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:50,388
KAT: I CAN DO BOTH QUICKLY.

392
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:51,857
I CAN SAY FIRST OF ALL, NO JUDGE

393
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:52,591
ON EATING GLUE.

394
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,092
WHEN I WAS A CHILD I USED TO

395
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:54,926
LOVE TO EAT THE DELICIOUS ROCK

396
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:56,094
RESULTS THAT THEY USE TO MELT

397
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:56,995
THE SNOW.

398
00:12:56,996 --> 00:13:00,232
GREG: YES, YES.

399
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,766
KAT: AND I WAS QUITE POPULAR IN

00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:05,103
THE THIRD GRADE.

401
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,171

402
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:07,105

403
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:12,143
ERIC HOLDER SAYING WHEN THEY GO

404
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:12,611
LOW, KICK THEM.

405
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:14,145
NOT ONLY IS THAT NOT NICE BUT

406
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:15,981
ALSO NOT VERY EFFECTIVE AS IF

407
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:17,282
I'M ON THE GROUND AND SOMEONE IS

408
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:21,152
KICKING ME I'M NOT GOING TO BE

409
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:24,422
THINKING I WOULD LOVE TO

410
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:25,090
THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDER THIS

411
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:26,091
PERSON'S VIEWS ON HEALTHCARE AND

412
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:26,491
IMMIGRATION.

413
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:27,292
I'M THINKING WHY IS THIS [BLEEP]

414
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:28,460
KICKING ME AND SO IF THEY REALLY

415
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:30,629
WANT TO HAVE THESE MEANINGFUL

416
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,830
DIALOGUE ABOUT ISSUES AND MAKE A

417
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:33,198
CHANGE THEN YOU HAVE TO BE CIVI

418
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:33,498
CIVIL.

419
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:41,373
GREG: HAVE TO MOVE ON BUT I

420
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:42,107
