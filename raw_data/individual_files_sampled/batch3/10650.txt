the UK defense research laboratory however maintains that the substance used is Nava choc a military-grade nerve agents the British government swiftly moved to defend its position by claiming this accusations against Russia remain valid despite this latest revelation from Porton Down is that it's working from a larger intelligence picture and there Russia has a record of state-sponsored assassinations and views it's former intelligence officers as targets Britain also says there's no other explanation it deems plausible but with scientists unable to verify the source it's possible London may have jumped the gun as mode gas D of explodes Scotland Yard said at first they need time this was a professional assassination attempt whoever did it made sure to leave as few traces as possible an investigation of this complexity in size will understandably take some time and we ask for the public's continuing support and patience the media didn't need much time pundits four went the whole boring you know investigation part but that's the media no surprise they need their ratings politicians they only needed a week is highly likely that Russia was responsible we do holes Russia culpable culpable culpable for the attempted murder Russia is Cape is culpable our quarry is with Putin's Kremlin and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision what's remarkable is the detectives are silent technical experts silent no details at all Russia's asking for some any information in fact a sample of the nerve agent perhaps so far nothing instead Downing Street gets down to the punishment with its allies skipping the whole innocent until proven otherwise likely is as good as guilty we are without doubt that Russia is responsible there is no plausible alternative explanation nearly 200 diplomats expelled by Britain its allies and Russia diplomatic relations hit rock bottom and then we get the chemical expertise from Britain's own laboratory we have not verified the precise source you have not been able to establish a potent down that this was made in Russia as I said it's our job to provide you know their scientific evidence that identifies what the particular nerve agent is you'd think that would at least slightly embarrass those shouting loudest about Russia's guilt now we'll it comes down to what particular job certain scientists have now portent down say their job is to work out what the substance was and they've established that it is Nava choc and that is by definition of the translation of the name which means newcomer part of a program in the Soviet Union in the late 70s and 80s the nuva chokes dozens and dozens of different nerve agents have been synthesized not just by Russia the head of Porton Down refused to clarify whether his own laboratory had its own stockpile well there's no way that anything like that would ever have come from us or you know leave the four walls of our facilities we deal with a number of very toxic substances as part of the work that we do we've got the highest levels of security and controls the Nova choc formulas have been available in public books for nearly a decade and pretty much any specialist with solid knowledge of organic chemistry can create it if it's really another truck we're dealing with it's not a real problem to synthesize that kind of nerve agent all the necessary components are easily available on the open market the synthesis does not require sophisticated procedures any specialist in organic chemistry would be able to make it the fact that the experts can't determine the Russians did it doesn't mean that UK authorities will change their mantra it is our assessment that Russia was responsible for his brazen and reckless act and there is no other plausible explanation remarkable how quickly things escalated and all hinging on that faith based highly likely assessment well Russia has always strenuously denied involvement in the poisoning despite frequent accusations against the country and even the president's Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov says Boris Johnson will have to apologize for his inflammatory statements against Russia the UK's Foreign Minister have been blaming Vladimir Putin we'll have to look in the eyes of the EU colleagues and he will have to apologise to Russia somehow tis a classic Russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haste of lies and obfuscation for him I believe this is a resigning matter because he didn't just join in the chorus of blamed Russia he lied on national television on the state broadcaster of the BBC he said I have spoken to this guy at Porton down but she's a very guy who made the statement today on behalf of Porton Down and he said that guy told him that it was Russia that did it that it could only have been Russia that did it this was worse than a mistake it was a lie
