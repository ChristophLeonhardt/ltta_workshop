AND THE ECONOMIC AGENDA.
AND THE PRESIDENT'S HEADING INTO
THE DIPLOMATIC ROOM RIGHT NOW.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LAST NIGHT, I RETURNED FROM A 
HISTORIC 12-DAY TRIP TO ASIA.
THIS JOURNEY TOOK US TO FIVE 
NATIONS, TO MEET WITH DOZENS OF 
FOREIGN LEADERS, PARTICIPATE IN 
THREE FORMAL STATE VISITS AND 
ATTEND THREE KEY REGIONAL 
SUMMITS.
IT WAS THE LONGEST VISIT TO THE 
REGION BY AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT 
IN MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A 
CENTURY.
EVERYWHERE WE WENT, OUR FOREIGN 
HOSTS GREETED THE AMERICAN 
DELEGATION, MYSELF INCLUDED, 
WITH INCREDIBLE WARMTH, 
HOSPITALITY, AND MOST 
IMPORTANTLY, RESPECT.
AND THIS GREAT RESPECT SHOWED 
VERY WELL OUR COUNTRY IS FURTHER
EVIDENCE THAT AMERICA'S RENEWED 
CONFIDENCE IN STANDING IN THE 
WORLD HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER 
THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW.
WHEN WE ARE CONFIDENT IN 
OURSELVES, OUR STRENGTH, OUR 
FLAG, OUR HISTORY, OUR VALUES, 
OTHER NATIONS ARE CONFIDENT IN 
US.
AND WHEN WE TREAT OUR CITIZENS 
WITH THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE, 
OTHER COUNTRIES TREAT AMERICA 
WITH THE RESPECT THAT OUR 
COUNTRY SO RICHLY DESERVES.
DURING OUR TRAVELS, THIS IS 
EXACTLY WHAT THE WORLD SAW.
A STRONG, PROUD, AND CONFIDENT 
AMERICA.
TODAY, I WANT TO UPDATE THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF THIS TRIP 
AND THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TO 
ADVANCE AMERICAN SECURITY AND 
PROSPERITY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, OUR 
COUNTRY WAS FACED WITH A SERIES 
OF GROWING DANGERS.
THESE THREATS INCLUDED ROGUE 
REGIMES PURSUING DEADLY WEAPONS,
FOREIGN POWERS CHALLENGING 
AMERICA'S INFLUENCE, THE SPREAD 
OF THE MURDEROUS TERROR GROUP 
ISIS, AND YEARS OF UNFAIR TRADE 
PRACTICES THAT HAD DANGEROUSLY 
DEPLETED OUR MANUFACTURING BASE 
AND WIPED OUT MILLIONS AND 
MILLIONS OF MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS.
THE CHALLENGES WERE INHERITED, 
AND THESE PRODUCTS REALLY SHOWED
WHAT PREVIOUS MISTAKES WERE MADE
OVER MANY YEARS AND EVEN DECADES
BY OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS.
SOME OF THESE MISTAKES WERE BORN
OF DIFFERENCE AND NEGLECT.
OTHERS FROM NAIVE THINKING AND 
MISGUIDED JUDGMENT.
IN SOME CASES, THE NEGATIVE 
INFLUENCE OF PARTISAN POLITICS 
AND SPECIAL INTERESTS WAS TO 
BLAME.
BUT THE ONE COMMON THREAD BEHIND
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS WAS A 
FAILURE TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE 
THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND AMERICAN WORKERS.
UPON MY INAUGURATION, I PLEDGED 
THAT WE WOULD REBUILD AMERICA, 
RESTORE ITS ECONOMIC STRENGTH, 
AND DEFEND ITS NATIONAL 
SECURITY.
WITH THIS GOAL IN MIND, I VOWED 
THAT WE WOULD REAFFIRM OLD 
ALLIANCES AND FORM NEW 
FRIENDSHIPS IN PURSUIT OF SHARED
GOALS.
ABOVE ALL, I SWORE THAT IN EVERY
DECISION WITH EVERY ACTION, I 
WOULD PUT THE BEST INTERESTS OF 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST.
OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS, 
TRAVELING ACROSS THE GLOBE AND 
MEETING WITH WORLD LEADERS, THAT
IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE DONE.
EARLIER THIS YEAR, IN SAUDI 
ARABIA, I SPOKE TO THE LEADERS 
OF MORE THAN 50 ERIC AND MUSLIM 
NATIONS ABOUT OUR STRATEGY TO 
DEFEAT TERRORISTS BY STRIPPING 
THEM OF FINANCING, TERRITORY, 
AND IDEALOGICAL SUPPORT.
AND I URGED THE LEADERS TO DRIVE
OUT THE TERRORISTS AND 
EXTREMISTS FROM THEIR SOCIETIES.
SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE DEALT 
ISIS ONE CRUSHING DEFEAT AFTER 
ANOTHER.
IN ISRAEL I REAFFIRMED THE 
UNBREAKABLE BOND BETWEEN AMERICA
AND THE JEWISH STATE, AND I MET 
WITH LEADERS OF THE PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY AND INITIATED AN 
EFFORT TO FACILITATE LASTING 
PEACE BETWEEN THE ISRAELIS AND 
THE PALESTINIANS.
IN BRUSSELS, I URGED OUR NATO 
ALLIES TO DO MORE TO STRENGTHEN 
OUR CRUCIAL ALLIANCE AND SET THE
STAGE FOR SIGNIFICANT INCREASES 
IN MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS.
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
ARE POURING IN BECAUSE OF THAT 
INITIATIVE.
NATO, BELIEVE ME, IS VERY HAPPY 
WITH DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT I 
DID.
IN WARSAW, I DECLARED TO THE 
WORLD AMERICA'S RESOLVE TO 
PRESERVE AND PROTECT WESTERN 
CIVILIZATION AND THE VALUES WE 
HOLD SO DEAR.
IN ROME, SICILY, HAMBURG, AND 
PARIS, I STRENGTHENED OUR 
FRIENDSHIPS WITH KEY ALLIES TO 
PROMOTE OUR SHARED INTERESTS OF 
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY.
IN SEPTEMBER AT THE UNITED 
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW 
YORK, I URGED THAT THE NATIONS 
OF THE WORLD JOIN IN CONFRONTING
ROGUE REGIMES THAT THREATEN 
HUMANITY AND LAID OUT A MODEL 
FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
GROUNDED IN RESPECT FOR 
SOVEREIGNTY AND THE 
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH 
IT.
ON EACH TRIP, I HAVE WORKED TO 
ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS AND 
LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD.
AND TO EACH OF THESE PLACES I 
HAVE CARRIED OUR VISION FOR A 
BETTER, A VISION FOR SOMETHING 
STRONGER, AND SOVEREIGN, SO 
IMPORTANT.
SOVEREIGN.
AND INDEPENDENT NATIONS ROOTED 
IN THEIR HISTORIES, CONFIDENT IN
THEIR DESTINIES, AND COOPERATING
TOGETHER TO ADVANCE THEIR 
SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND THE 
NOBLE CAUSE OF PEACE.
IT WAS THIS SAME VISION THAT I 
CARRIED TO ASIA TWO WEEKS AGO.
AND IT WAS THIS SAME COMMITMENT 
TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 
THAT WAS ALWAYS AT THE FOREFRONT
OF MY MIND AND MY THINKING.
OUR TRIP WAS DEFINED BY THREE 
CORE GOALS.
FIRST, TO UNITE THE WORLD 
AGAINST THE NUCLEAR MENACE POSED
BY THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME, A 
THREAT THAT HAS INCREASED 
STEADILY THROUGH MANY 
ADMINISTRATIONS AND NOW REQUIRES
URGENT ACTION.
SECOND, TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S 
ALLIANCES AND ECONOMIC 
PARTNERSHIPS IN A FREE AND OPEN 
INDO-PACIFIC MADE UP OF THRIVING
INDEPENDENT NATIONS RESPECTFUL 
OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEIR OWN
CITIZENS AND SAFE FROM FOREIGN 
DOMINATION AND ECONOMIC 
SERVITUDE.
AND THIRD, TO FINALLY, AFTER 
MANY YEARS, INSIST ON FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL TRADE.
FAIR AND RECIPROCAL TRADE.
SO IMPORTANT.
THESE TWO WORDS, FAIRNESS AND 
RECIPROCITY, ARE AN OPEN 
INVITATION TO EVERY COUNTRY THAT
SEEKS TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE 
UNITED STATES.
AND THEY ARE A FIRM WARNING TO 
EVERY COUNTRY THAT CHEATS, 
BREAKS THE RULES, AND ENGAGES IN
ECONOMIC AGGRESSION LIKE THEY 
HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE RECENT PAST.
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ALMOST AN 
$800 BILLION A YEAR TRADE 
DEFICIT WITH OTHER NATIONS.
UNACCEPTABLE.
WE ARE GOING TO START WHITTLING 
THAT DOWN AND AS FAST AS 
POSSIBLE.
WITH THESE GOALS, IT WAS MY 
PROFOUND HONOR TO TRAVEL ON THIS
JOURNEY AS YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
I EXPLAINED TO ALL OF THE WORLD 
LEADERS AND ACROSS ASIA HOW WELL
THE UNITED STATES IS DOING.
ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN OVER 3%
THE LAST TWO QUARTERS.
AND IT'S GOING HIGHER.
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS LOWEST 
LEVEL IN 17 YEARS.
THE STOCK MARKET HAS GAINED 
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN VALUE 
SINCE MY ELECTION AND HAS 
REACHED RECORD HIGHS.
WE ARE MASSIVELY INCREASING OUR 
MILITARY BUDGET TO HISTORIC 
LEVELS.
THE HOUSE HAS JUST PASSED A 
NEARLY $700 BILLION DEFENSE 
PACKAGE, AND IT COULD NOT COME 
AT A BETTER TIME FOR OUR NATION.
ONCE AGAIN, OUR COUNTRY IS 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE.
CONFIDENT IN OUR VALUES, AND 
PROUD OF OUR HISTORY, AND A ROLE
IN THE WORLD.
I WANT TO THANK EVERY CITIZEN OF
THIS COUNTRY FOR THE PART YOU 
HAVE PLAYED IN MAKING THIS GREAT
AMERICAN COMEBACK POSSIBLE.
IN ASIA, OUR MESSAGE WAS CLEAR 
AND WELL RECEIVED.
AMERICA IS HERE TO COMPETE, TO 
DO BUSINESS, AND TO DEFEND OUR 
VALUES AND OUR SECURITY.
WE BEGAN OUR TRIP IN HAWAII TO 
PAY OUR RESPECTS TO BRAVE 
AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS AT 
PEARL HARBOR AND THE UNITED 
STATES PACIFIC COMMAND.
THE GUARDIAN OF OUR SECURITY AND
FREEDOM ACROSS THE INDO-PACIFIC 
REGION.
AS OUR COUNTRY PREPARED TO 
OBSERVE VETERANS DAY, WE 
REMEMBERED THE INCREDIBLE 
SACRIFICES AND COURAGE OF ALL OF
THE VETERANS WHOSE SERVICE HAS 
PRESERVED OUR LIBERTY AND A WAY 
OF LIFE THAT IS VERY SPECIAL.
WE ALSO THANKED MILITARY 
FAMILIES FOR THEIR SUPPORT, FOR 
OUR BRAVE SERVICEMEN AND HAWAII 
JAPAN, A CRUCIAL U.S. ALLY AND 
PARTNER IN THE REGION.
UPON LANDING IN JAPAN, MY FIRST 
ACT WAS TO THANK THE AMERICAN 
SERVICE MEMBERS AND JAPANESE 
SELF-DEFENSE FORCES WHO 
PERSONIFY THE STRENGTH OF OUR 
ENDURING ALLIANCE.
PRIME MINISTER ABE AND I AGREED 
ON OUR ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION TO
REMAIN UNITED, TO ACHIEVE THE 
GOAL OF DENUCLEARIZED NORTH 
KOREA.
SHORTLY FOLLOWING OUR VISIT, 
JAPAN ANNOUNCED ADDITIONAL 
SANCTIONS ON 35 NORTH KOREAN 
ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS.
JAPAN ALSO COMMITTED TO 
SHOULDERING MORE OF THE BURDEN 
OF OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY 
REIMBURSING COSTS BORN BY 
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS AS WELL AS BY
MAKING DEEP INVESTMENTS IN 
JAPAN'S OWN MILITARY.
THIS WILL INCLUDE PURCHASES OF 
U.S. ADVANCED CAPABILITIES FROM 
JET FIGHTERS TO MISSILE DEFENSE,
SYSTEMS WORTH MANY, MANY 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
AND JOBS FOR THE AMERICAN 
WORKER.
PRIME MINISTER AND I ALSO 
DISCUSSED WAYS WE CAN DEEPEN OUR
TRADE RELATIONSHIP BASED ON THE 
CORE PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS AND 
RECIPROCITY.
I AM PLEASED THAT SINCE JANUARY 
OF THIS YEAR, JAPANESE COMPANIES
HAVE ANNOUNCED INVESTMENTS IN 
THE UNITED STATES WORTH MORE 
THAN $8 BILLION.
17,000 JOBS.
THANK YOU.
THEY DON'T HAVE WATER.
THAT'S OKAY.
WHAT?
IT'S OKAY.
OH.
JAPANESE MANUFACTURERS, TOYOTA 
AND MAZDA, ANNOUNCED THEY WILL 
BE OPENING A NEW PLANT IN THE 
UNITED STATES THAT WILL CREATE 
4,000 JOBS.
WE ALSO SIGNED AGREEMENTS 
BETWEEN OUR NATIONS TO ENHANCE 
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, 
INCREASED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE 
ENERGY, AND ADVANCE OUR FOREIGN 
POLICY GOALS THROUGH ECONOMIC 
INVESTMENT.
FROM JAPAN, WE TRAVELED TO 
ANOTHER KEY AMERICAN ALLY IN 
ASIA, THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.
MY OFFICIAL STATE VISIT TO SOUTH
KOREA WAS THE FIRST BY AN 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN 25 YEARS.
SPEAKING BEFORE THE NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA, I SPOKE THE TRUTH ABOUT 
THE EVIL CRIMES OF THE NORTH 
KOREAN REGIME AND I MADE CLEAR 
THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW THIS 
TWISTED DICTATORSHIP TO HOLD THE
WORLD HOSTAGE TO NUCLEAR 
BLACKMAIL.
I CALLED ON EVERY NATION 
INCLUDING CHINA AND RUSSIA TO 
UNITE IN ISOLATING THE NORTH 
KOREAN REGIME, CUTTING OFF ALL 
TIES OF TRADE AND COMMERCE UNTIL
IT STOPS ITS DANGEROUS 
PROVOCATION ON, AND THIS IS THE 
WHOLE KEY TO WHAT WE'RE DOING, 
ON DENUCLEARIZATION.
WE HAVE TO DENUCLEARIZE NORTH 
KOREA.
WE HAVE ENDED THE FAILED 
STRATEGY OF STRATEGIC PATIENCE, 
AND AS A RESULT, WE HAVE ALREADY
SEEN IMPORTANT PROGRESS.
INCLUDING TOUGH NEW SANCTIONS 
FROM THE U.N. COUNCIL.
WE HAVE A SECURITY COUNCIL THAT 
HAS BEEN WITH US AND JUST ABOUT 
WITH US FROM THE BEGINNING.
SOUTH KOREA AGREED TO HARMONIZE 
SANCTIONS AND JOIN THE UNITED 
STATES IN SANCTIONING ADDITIONAL
ROGUE ACTORS WHOSE FUND AND 
FUNDS HAVE HELPED NORTH KOREA 
AND NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR AND 
BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS.
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO US.
THE UNITED STATES WELCOMED THE 
DECISION OF PRESIDENT MOON TO 
REMOVE THE PAY LOAD RESTRICTIONS
ON MISSILES TO COMBAT THE NORTH 
KOREAN THREAT, AND TOGETHER, WE 
REAFFIRMED OUR COMMITMENT TO A 
CAMPAIGN OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE.
LIKE JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA IS 
INCREASING ITS DEFENSE 
CONTRIBUTIONS.
DURING OUR MEETINGS, PRESIDENT 
MOON ACKNOWLEDGED HIS DESIRE FOR
EQUITABLE COST SHARING FOR THE 
UNITED STATES MILITARY FORCES 
STATIONED IN SOUTH KOREA.
AND I VISITED SOLDIERS AT CAMP 
HUMPHRIES, A BRAND-NEW JOINT 
AMERICAN/SOUTH KOREAN BASE PAID 
FOR ALMOST ENTIRELY BY THE SOUTH
KOREAN GOVERNMENT.
AT THAT BASE, I DISCUSSED WITH 
THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH 
KOREAN MILITARY LEADERS BOTH 
MILITARY OPTIONS AND READINESS 
TO RESPOND TO NORTH KOREAN 
PROVOCATION OR OFFENSIVE 
ACTIONS.
DURING OUR VISIT, PRESIDENT MOON
AND I ALSO DISCUSSED AMERICA'S 
COMMITMENT TO REDUCING OUR TRADE
DEFICIT WITH SOUTH KOREA.
AT MY DISCRETION AND DIRECTION, 
WE ARE CURRENTLY RENEGOTIATING 
THE DISASTROUS U.S./KOREA TRADE 
AGREEMENT SIGNED UNDER THE 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.
IT HAS BEEN A DISASTER FOR THE 
UNITED STATES.
LAST WEEK, 42 SOUTH KOREAN 
COMPANIES ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENT
TO INVEST IN PROJECTS WORTH MORE
THAN $17 BILLION IN THE UNITED 
STATES.
AND 24 COMPANIES ANNOUNCED PLANS
TO PURCHASE $58 BILLION IN 
AMERICAN GOODS AND SERVICES.
FROM SOUTH KOREA, MELANIA AND I 
TRAVELED TO CHINA WHERE AS IN 
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA, WE WERE 
GREATLY HONORED BY THE SPLENDOR 
OF OUR RECEPTION.
OUR TRIP INCLUDED THE FIRST 
OFFICIAL DINNER HELD FOR A 
FOREIGN LEADER IN THE FORBIDDEN 
CITY SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE 
MODERN CHINA, WHERE WE ENJOYED A
VERY PRODUCTIVE EVENING HOSTED 
BY PRESIDENT XI AND HIS 
WONDERFUL WIFE.
DURING OUR VISIT, PRESIDENT XI 
PLEDGED TO FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENT 
UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS ON NORTH KOREA AND 
TO USE HIS GREAT ECONOMIC 
INFLUENCE OVER THE REGIME TO 
ACHIEVE OUR COMMON GOAL OF A 
DENUCLEARIZED KOREAN PENINSULA.
PRESIDENT XI RECOGNIZES THAT A 
NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA IS A GRAVE 
THREAT TO CHINA, AND WE AGREE 
THAT WE WOULD NOT ACCEPT A 
SO-CALLED FREEZE FOR FREEZE 
AGREEMENT LIKE THOSE THAT HAVE 
CONSISTENTLY FAILED IN THE PAST.
WE MADE THAT TIME IS RUNNING 
OUT, AND WE MADE IT CLEAR.
AND ALL OPTIONS REMAIN ON THE 
TABLE.
I ALSO HAD A VERY CANDID 
CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT XI 
ABOUT THE NEED TO REDUCE OUR 
STAGGERING TRADE DEFICIT WITH 
CHINA AND FOR OUR TRADING 
RELATIONSHIP TO BE CONDUCTED ON 
A TRULY FAIR AND EQUITABLE 
BASIS.
WE CAN NO LONGER TOLERATE UNFAIR
TRADING PRACTICES THAT STEAL 
AMERICAN JOBS, WEALTH, AND 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
THE DAYS OF THE UNITED STATES 
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ARE 
OVER.
IN CHINA, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED $250
BILLION WORTH IN TRADE 
INVESTMENT DEALS THAT WILL 
CREATE JOBS IN THE UNITED 
STATES.
FROM CHINA, I FLEW TO THE CITY 
OF DA NANG IN VIETNAM TO ATTEND 
THE LEADERS MEETING FOR APEC 
ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION.
THERE I SPOKE TO A MAJOR 
GATHERING OF BUSINESS LEADERS 
WHERE I REMINDED THE WORLD OF 
AMERICA'S HISTORIC ROLE IN THE 
PACIFIC AS A FORCE FOR FREEDOM 
AND FOR PEACE.
STANDING AT THIS PROUD HISTORY, 
I OFFERED OUR VISION FOR ROBUST 
TRADING RELATIONSHIPS IN WHICH 
INDO-PACIFIC NATIONS CAN ALL 
PROSPER AND GROW TOGETHER.
I ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED 
STATES IS READY TO MAKE 
BILATERAL TRADE DEALS WITH ANY 
NATION IN THE REGION THAT WANTS 
TO BE OUR PARTNER IN FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL TRADE.
WE WILL NEVER AGAIN TURN A BLIND
EYE TO TRADING ABUSES, TO 
CHEATING, ECONOMIC AGGRESSION, 
OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM COUNTRIES 
THAT PROFESS A BELIEF IN OPEN 
TRADE BUT DO NOT FOLLOW THE 
RULES OR LIVE BY ITS PRINCIPLES 
THEMSELVES.
NO INTERNATIONAL TRADING 
ORGANIZATION CAN FUNCTION IF 
MEMBERS ARE ALLOWED TO EXPLOIT 
THE OPENNESS OF OTHERS FOR 
UNFAIR ECONOMIC GAIN.
TRADE ABUSES HARM THE UNITED 
STATES AND ITS WORKERS BUT NO 
MORE.
NO MORE.
WE WILL TAKE EVERY TRADE ACTION 
NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE FAIR 
AND RECIPROCAL TREATMENT THAT 
THE UNITED STATES HAS OFFERED TO
THE REST OF THE WORLD FOR 
DECADES.
MY MESSAGE HAS RESONATED THAT 21
APEC LEADERS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
EVER RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE 
OF FAIR AND RECIPROCAL TRADE, 
RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO ADDRESS 
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES, AND 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE WTO IS IN 
STRONG NEED OF REFORM.
THESE LEADERS ALSO NOTED THAT 
COUNTRIES MUST DO A BETTER JOB 
FOLLOWING THE RULES TO WHICH 
THEY AGREE.
I ALSO MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THE 
UNITED STATES WILL PROMOTE A 
FREE AND OPEN INDO-PACIFIC IN 
WHICH NATIONS ENJOY THE 
INDEPENDENCE AND RESPECT THEY 
DESERVE.
IN VIETNAM, DURING A STATE VISIT
IN HANOI, I ALSO MET WITH 
PRESIDENT KWAN AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER TO DISCUSS THE GROWING 
FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN OUR 
COUNTRIES.
OUR VIETNAMESE PARTNERS ARE 
TAKING NEW ACTIONS TO ENFORCE 
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA.
IN ADDITION, WE COMMITTED TO 
EXPAND TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES.
AND WE PLEDGED TO ADDRESS THE 
IMBALANCES.
I AM PARTICULARLY PLEASED THAT 
THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM 
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED $12 BILLION 
IN COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS WHICH 
WILL INCLUDE $10 BILLION IN U.S.
CONTENT.
FINALLY, I VISITED THE 
PHILIPPINES WHERE I MET WITH 
NUMEROUS WORLD LEADERS AT THE 
U.S. ASEAN AND EAST ASIAN 
SUMMITS.
AT ASEAN THE ASSOCIATION OF 
SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS, WE MADE
IT CLEAR THAT NO ONE OWNS THE 
OCEAN.
FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION AND 
OVERFLIGHT ARE CRITICAL TO THE 
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF ALL 
NATIONS.
I ALSO MET WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTERS OF INDIA, AUSTRALIA, 
AND JAPAN TO DISCUSS OUR SHARED 
COMMITMENT TO A FREE AND OPEN 
INDO-PACIFIC.
DURING OUR VISIT, PRESIDENT 
DUTERTE OF THE PHILIPPINES 
THANKED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 
OUR ARMED FORCES FOR SUPPORTING 
THE RECENT LIBERATION OF MUROWY 
FROM ISIS.
WE PLEDGE TO STRENGTHEN AND 
DEEPEN OUR LONG-STANDING 
ALLIANCE.
AT THE EAST ASIA SUMMIT, THE 
UNITED STATES NEGOTIATED AND 
SIGNED FOUR IMPORTANT LEADERS 
STATEMENTS ON THE USE OF 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS, MONEY 
LAUNDERING, POVERTY ALLEVIATION,
AND COUNTERING TERRORIST 
PROPAGANDA AND FINANCING.
AND CRUCIALLY, AT BOTH SUMMITS 
AND THROUGHOUT THE TRIP, WE 
ASKED ALL NATIONS TO SUPPORT OUR
CAMPAIGN OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE FOR
NORTH KOREAN DENUCLEARIZATION.
AND THEY ARE RESPONDING BY 
CUTTING TRADE WITH NORTH KOREA, 
RESTRICTING FINANCIAL TIES TO 
THE REGIME, AND EXPELLING NORTH 
KOREAN DIPLOMATS AND WORKERS.
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, WE HAVE
MADE HISTORIC STRIDES IN 
REASSERTING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP,
RESTORING AMERICAN SECURITY, AND
REAWAKENING AMERICAN CONFIDENCE.
EVERYWHERE WE WENT, I REAFFIRMED
OUR VISION FOR COOPERATION 
BETWEEN PROUD, INDEPENDENT, AND 
SOVEREIGN COUNTRIES.
AND I MADE CLEAR THAT THE UNITED
STATES WILL BE A RELIABLE 
FRIEND, A STRONG PARTNER, AND A 
POWERFUL ADVOCATE FOR ITS OWN 
CITIZENS.
THE MOMENTUM FROM OUR TRIP WILL 
LAUNCH US ON OUR CONTINUED 
EFFORT TO ACCOMPLISH THE THREE 
CORE OBJECTIVES I OUTLINED.
TO UNITE THE WORLD AGAINST NORTH
KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT, TO 
PROMOTE A FREE AND OPEN 
INDO-PACIFIC REGION.
AND TO ADVANCE FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
WITH OUR TRADING PARTNERS AND 
ALLIES IN THE REGION.
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A NEW 
FRAMEWORK FOR TRADE THAT WILL 
INSURE RECIPROCITY THROUGH 
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, REFORM OF 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND
NEW FAIR TRADE DEALS THAT 
BENEFIT THE UNITED STATES AND 
OUR PARTNERS.
AND WE HAVE LAID OUT A PATHWAY 
TOWARD PEACE AND SECURITY IN OUR
WORLD WHERE SOVEREIGN NATIONS 
CAN THRIVE, FLOURISH, AND 
PROSPER SIDE BY SIDE.
THIS IS OUR BEAUTIFUL VISION FOR
THE FUTURE.
THIS IS A FUTURE WHERE THIS 
VISION, THIS DREAM, IS ONLY 
POSSIBLE IF AMERICA IS STRONG, 
PROUD, AND FREE.
AS LONG AS WE ARE TRUE TO 
OURSELVES, FAITHFUL TO OUR 
FOUNDING AND LOYAL TO OUR 
CITIZENS, THEN THERE IS NO TASK 
TOO GREAT, NO DREAM TOO LARGE, 
NO GOAL BEYOND OUR REACH.
MY FELLOW CITIZENS, AMERICA IS 
BACK.
AND THE FUTURE HAS NEVER LOOKED 
BRIGHTER.
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.
AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
>> SHOULD ROY MORE RESIGN, 
MR. PRESIDENT?
DO YOU BELIEVE -- 
>> YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT LEAVING
THE DIPLOMATIC ROOM, REFUSING TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ROY 
MOORE, THAT EMBATTLED REPUBLICAN
SENATE CANDIDATE IN ALABAMA 
FACED WITH ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT, DATING TEENAGERS 
WHEN HE WAS IN HIS 30s.
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR HIM ON 
CAPITOL HILL HAS COLLAPSED.
RIGHT NOW, THE PRESIDENT NOT 
WANTING TO WEIGH IN ON THAT.
WHAT PRESIDENT DID DO IS GIVE A 
REPORT ON HIS 13-DAY VISIT TO 
ASIA, SAYING THE WORLD SAW A 
STRONG, PROUD, AND CONFIDENT 
AMERICA ON THAT TRIP.
HE LAID OUT THE THREE GOALS THAT
HE HAD IN A COUNTRY BY COUNTRY 
REPORT, UNITING THE WORLD 
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, 
STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC 
ALLIANCES, AND GETTING FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL TRADE.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 
GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANCHOR MARTHA 
RADDATZ.
REMARKABLE IN A COUPLE WAYS.
NUMBER ONE, A REAL BROADSIDE 
AGAINST HIS PREDECESSORS SAYING 
ALL OF HIS PREDECESSORS HAD MADE
MISTAKES, NAIVE THINKING, 
MISGUIDED JUDGMENT, NEGLECT.
A FAILURE TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE
AMERICAN INTERESTS.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO LAID OUT 
THOSE GOALS, NOT A LOT OF 
CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL 
STEPS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS.
>> YEAH, A LOT OF TOUGH WORDS 
THERE, GEORGE.
AND THE TRIP HAD A LOT OF 
DAZZLE.
HE SAID HE WAS WORKING ON 
RELATIONSHIPS.
WE CAN ALL RECALL THAT HE HAD 
KIND WORDS ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN.
HE HAD KIND WORDS ABOUT CHINA, 
BUT THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING 
SUBSTANTIAL DONE.
SO WE HEARD A LOT OF TOUGH 
WORDS.
WE HEARD ABOUT THIS CONFIDENCE, 
BUT IT MADE ME THINK OF THE 
LATEST ABC/"WASHINGTON POST" 
POLL, 60% OF THOSE POLLS DO NOT 
TRUST DONALD TRUMP TO ACT 
RESPONSIBLY WITH NORTH KOREA.
53% SAY AMERICAN LEADERSHIP HAS 
GOTTEN WEAKER UNDER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
AND WE STILL HAVE THAT LOOMING 
PROBLEM OF NORTH KOREA.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED THAT 
PROBLEM.
IF WE DON'T ALREADY, WE WILL 
HAVE A NORTH KOREA CAPABLE OF 
PUTTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON ON AN 
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
MISSILE, BUT THAT REMAINS A HUGE
PROBLEM AND A HUGE THREAT THAT 
IS YET TO BE VOSOLVED.
>> ALTHOUGH THE RHETORIC ON 
NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN 
TONED DOWN.
>> AND NORTH KOREA HASN'T 
LAUNCHED A MISSILE OR HAD TESTS 
IN WELL OVER A MONTH.
THAT'S SOMETHING EVERYONE IS 
LOOKING AT.
THEY'RE NOT SURE WHY THEY THAT 
HAPPENED, BUT THE PRESIDENT ON 
THIS TRIP DID TONE DOWN HIS 
RHETORIC EXCEPT FOR THE ONE 
TWEET WHERE HE CALLED JIM 
JONG-UN SHORT AND FAT.
>> I WANT TO GO TO MARY BRUCE ON
CAPITOL HILL.
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT.
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE PRESIDENT 
TALK ABOUT ROY MOORE THERE, EVEN
THOUGH HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO 
ADDRESS THIS WHEN HE GOT BACK IN
THE UNITED STATES.
PERHAPS WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM ON 
ANOTHER FRONT.
AS I SAID, AS THE PRESIDENT IS 
REFUSING TO SPEAK OUT RIGHT NOW,
REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL HAVE
COMPLETELY ABANDONED ROY MOORE.
>> YEAH, GEORGE, AND IT'S PRETTY
REMARKABLE TO THINK RIGHT NOW, 
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT STANDS EXACTLY.
IN HIS ABSENCE, WE HAVE SEEN A 
WAVE OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS 
COMING OUT, NOW SAYING THEY 
BELIEVE THAT ROY MOORE SHOULD 
DROP OUT OF THE RACE, THAT THE 
ALLEGATIONS IN AND OF THEMSELVES
ARE DISQUALIFYING.
BUT DOES THE PRESIDENT AGREE 
WITH THEM?
THAT STILL REMAINS TO BE THE BIG
QUESTION.
AND IT'S WORTH A REMINDER THAT 
THE PRESIDENT TAKING A POSITION 
ON THIS, IF HE DOES AGREE WITH 
REPUBLICAN LEADERS, IS NOT 
WITHOUT RISK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW 
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ROY MOORE 
IS GOING ANYWHERE.
HE HAS BEEN DEFIANT.
WOULD HE AGREE?
WOULD HE COMPLY WITH THE 
PRESIDENT WERE HE TO CALL FOR 
HIM TO DROP OUT?
JUST A SHORT WILE AGO, GEORGE, 
ROY MOORE TWEETED AND I QUOTE, 
WE WILL NOT QUIT.
>> YEAH, ROY MOORE SAY HE'S 
STAYING IN NO MATTER WHAT.
THE ELECTION IS SET FOR DECEMBER
12th.
SOME NEW POLLS COMING OUT 
SHOWING FOR THE FIRST TIME 
PERHAPS THE DEMOCRAT DOUG JONES 
IS LEADING.
THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE TONIGHT 
ON WORLD NEWS WITH DAVID MUIR.
YOU CAN ALSO GET THE NEWS 
ANYTIME BY DOWNLOADING THE ABC 
NEWS APP.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW ON GMA.
