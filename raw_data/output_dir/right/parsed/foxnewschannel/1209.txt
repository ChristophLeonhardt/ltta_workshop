RICK?
RICK: JEFF PAUL IN HAWAII, JEFF,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>> THERE IS AN UNDERREPORTED
CRISIS IN AMERICA.
THE NATION'S LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS
FALLEN TWO YEARS IN A ROW, A
DECLINE NOT SEEN IN 100 YEARS.
RESEARCHERS POINT TO DEATHS OF
DESPAIR, LIVES LOST FROM DRUG
OVERDOSES, ALCOHOLISM AND
SUICIDE SPARKED IN PART BY
FALTERING ECONOMIC SECURITY AND
THE DOWN SLIDE OF TRADITIONAL
SUPPORT SYSTEMS.
IT IS A GRIM PICTURE AND
STATISTICS ALONE CAN'T TELL THE
STORY.
WE INVESTIGATED THE REALITY,
OUTSIDE THE D.C. BELTWAY ON THE
ISLAND OF MANHATTAN, SPEAKING
WITH PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE
CLUTCHES OF DESPAIR, A WORD THAT
MEANS THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF
HOPE.
OVER THESE NEXT FOUR WEEKS IN
JUNE, ON FOX REPORT SUNDAY, I
WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO FELLOW
AMERICANS WHO KNOW DESPAIR AND
REFUSE TO GIVE UP.
>> THEY WRITE YOU THE
PRESCRIPTION.
YOU PAY THE $100 CASH.
AND YOU LEAVE.
>> ALLEN IS 57 YEARS OLD.
HE SPENT MORE THAN 25 YEARS AS A
HOUSTON POLICE OFFICER, NEARLY
10 OF THOSE ADDICTED TO OPIATES.
HE SAID A TRIP TO THE DENTIST'S
OFFICE SET THE STAGE FOR HIS
ADDICTION.
>> I HAD SOME PRETTY EXTENSIVE
DENTAL WORK DONE TO MY TEETH AND
THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBED ME VICODIN
FOR THE PAIN.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A CURE FOR
A HANGOVER MY WHOLE LIFE AN TOOK
TWO OF THOSE LITTLE VICODIN AND
WITHIN 10 MINUTES MY HANGOVER
WAS OVER AND I WAS LIKE OH MY
GOD I DISCOVERED SOMETHING
>> HE LIED TO HIS DENTIST TO GET
REFILLS.
>> I ACTUALLY HAD TWO ROOT
CANALS FOR NO REASON.
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY
TEETH BUT I WOULD FAKE
TOOTHACHES TO KEEP HIM GOING.
SOME OF THE GUYS AT WORK NOTICED
I WAS SLURRING MY WORDS AND I
TOLD THEM I WAS TAKING PAIN
MEDICATION FOR MY DENTAL WORK.
>> HIS ADDICTION TOOK A MORE
DESTRUCTIVE TURN.
>> AND I RUN INTO A COUSIN OF
MINE WHO INTRODUCED ME TO A
POWERFUL -- MORE POWERFUL PAIN
PILL CALLED LORCET.
I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT HE TOLD
ME WHEN I LEFT HIS HOUSE THAT
NIGHT, HE SAID HEY ALAN, WELCOME
TO THE DARK SIDE.
>> BEFORE LONG HE WENT BACK TO
HIS COUSIN.
>> I'M ASKING MY COUSIN WHERE DO
YOU GET THESE THINGS?
>> AND HE SAID WELL YOU'VE GOT
TO GO TO THESE PILL MILL
DOCTORS.
>> PILL MILLS ARE PLACES WHERE
LICENSED PHYSICIANS SELL
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER THE
TABLE FOR PROFIT.
>> IT'S WHAT HE CALL THEM HERE
IN HOUSTON, PILL MILLS, AS A
MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE SO
PREVALENT THAT AFTER A
COMBINATION OF THREE DRUGS, IT
WAS DUBBED THE HOUSTON COCKTAIL.
>> MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT A
RECOVERY CENTER IN HOUSTON TEXAS
ALAN WAS ONE OF HIS PATIENTS.
HE SAYS WHILE PRESCRIPTION PILL
ABUSE PERSISTS HEROIN USE IS ON
THE RISE DUE TO ITS RELATIVE
AFFORDABILITY.
>> IT GOT EASIER TO ACQUIRE HERE
IN TEXAS AND THEN THE PROBLEM
BECAME THEN THE HEROIN STARTED
GETTING TAINTED WITH A DRUG
CALLED FENTANYL.
NOT ONLY HAVE WE SEEN AN UP TICK
IN HER RIN USE AND A MARKET --
HEROIN USE AND A MARKET UP TICK
IN DEATHS DUE TO THE TAINTED
HEROIN.
>> SOME HAVE BEEN HARDER HIT
THAN OTHERS
>> IT SEEMS WITHOUT QUESTION WE
ARE SEEING FAR MORE WHITE MALES
THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE
SECTOR OF THE POPULATION THAT
ARE USING.
>> 115 PEOPLE A DAY ARE DYING OF
OPIOID OVERDOSES.
THAT'S MORE PEOPLE THAN ARE
KILLED IN CAR WRECKS.
>> COUNTERING THE PILL MILL
CRISIS IS HARRIS COUNTY TEXAS
ATTORNEY VINCE RYAN WHO HAS
FILED SUIT AGAINST DRUG
COMPANIES, PHARMACISTS, AND
DOCTORS.
>> THEY PRESCRIBE HUNDREDS IF
NOT THOUSANDS OF OPIOID
PRESCRIPTIONS, MOST OF THE TIME
WITHOUT EVEN SEEING THE PROPOSED
PATIENTS.
>> ATTORNEY RYAN HOPES TO HELP
PEOPLE RECOVER AND REGAIN THEIR
LIVES, MUCH LIKE ALAN WHO NOW
SOBER FOR 5 1/2 YEARS SOUGHT AND
FOUND REDEMPTION.
>> THE BROTHERHOOD OF POLICE
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THERE WAS
DRUGS INVOLVED AND I'VE BEEN TO
JAIL AND ALL THAT.
>> ALAN SAYS HIS ADDICTION
ISOLATED HIM FROM HIS LEAGUES
UNTIL A FELLOW POLICE OFFICER
PASSED AWAY.
>> SO TWO YEARS SOBER, I GOT
INVITED TO A FUNERAL OF A FRIEND
OF MINE THAT I WORKED WITH FOR A
LONG TIME, AND AFTER THE FUNERAL
WAS OVER, I WAS OUTSIDE, AND I
HEARD THE HONOR GUARD YELL OUT
AN ORDER, ALL OFFICERS
ATTENTION.
I GOT TO STAND WITH THOSE GUYS,
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER, THANK GOD
THAT I GOT PULLED OUT OF THE
DEPTHS OF THIS DEAL, AND IF I
CAN DO IT, ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
ANYBODY.
I PROMISE YOU.
THE END.
RICK: THE OPIOID CRISIS HAS HIT
EVERY ONE OF OUR 50 STATES.
BUT FEW HAVE FELT THE BURDEN
MORE THAN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
NEXT WEEK WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE
