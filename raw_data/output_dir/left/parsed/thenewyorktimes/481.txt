It was a cold but very
sunny day,
and we were having a rally a
the Audubon Ballroom.
Two weeks prior to that, he had
been banned from France when
he tried to go to speak in Paris.
The next weekend,
his home was firebombed.
But I always remember him
saying,
"The way I feel today, I
shouldn't even be here."
We said to him, “Then why
don't you go home? Everybody
can understand all the pressure
you've been under."
And he said, "No. I really have to
speak today."
I heard Brother Malcolm say,
“asalam alaykum,” and next thing
I heard were the shots.
I ran all the way down the
Audubon and jumped up on the
stage.
His shirt was open, and I saw
all these holes in his body,
and he was gasping. And I
remember thinking to myself,
"He's going to die,
he's going to die. "
These brothers came up and
had to roll a stretcher
because not one doctor would
come over to the Audubon.
They were right across the
street and they had to
bogart a stretcher. And
they rolled it back over to the
hospital, and
it was announced that
he had died.
I stayed up all night.
I was just sitting there. I was
half crying.
I was angry.
The next day, I sat down
and I wrote.
I wrote about God.
Brother Malcolm had the ability
to inspire people.
To make them transcend their
own narrow interests and think
of a larger entity.
I think the human rights
movement was derailed
by the assassinations of
Brother Malcolm and Dr. King.
