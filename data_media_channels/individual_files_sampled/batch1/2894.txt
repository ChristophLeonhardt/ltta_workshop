if Trump wins I mean I expect that you're going to see a lot of venality among Republican leaders that they'll a lot of folks that have been saying we don't know if we like what Trump stands for are going to end up saying that they're willing to be part of a trump administration whether that will work effectively or not given how volatile compass is an open question but they'll have no choice so the Republican Party will coalesce around a group that ultimately is really not aligned with American demographic let's keep in mind United States becoming much more multicultural much more socially progressive much more secular Trump is the opposite of that so it's hard to imagine Trump lasting for more than one term but it's also hard to imagine the Republican Party being able to address that demographic change given the fact that Trump would be their standard bearer
