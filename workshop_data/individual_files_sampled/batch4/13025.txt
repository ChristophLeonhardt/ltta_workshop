I think we can all agree that feminists are among the worst people on earth I think the list goes communists Nazis orcs people who work for CNN rapists and killers and then feminists I think is I

feminism because for most human beings our gender is part of the joy of life you know women being women and men you know the French they say vive la diff√©rence you know and the feminists are like stamp out the different spaces they stamp out one of the key it's one of the key joys of life the fact that women are women and men are men most of us I would guess I don't know some incredibly high percentage eighty eighty-five percent of most of us this is where we find our joy this is what we like we like girls to be girls we like men to be men a very very small number of dissatisfied angry women scream and yell at us and it's toxic it makes it turns us against one another it makes us wonder if ordinary things that people do in every society like for instance every single society has different kinds of work for men and women every single one there's not a single society on earth where all except maybe this one where men and women do exactly the same thing that's a universal that's a human universal and they make us question that and feel about it and feel that oh if you know if there aren't enough women fighter pilots something is wrong it must be bigotry instead of natural proclivities natural talents natural things that we want to do and the problem is feminists are so awful that we react against them and people I've seen this especially in young guys who kind of grew up under feminism this anger against women as if women were feminists and as you know they conflate women and feminists and it's just not you know right we do is listen I think we do this with gays too by the way you know I mean gay people you know are living their lives doing their thing it's obviously not my thing it's probably not your thing but they're doing their thing and and then they they want to teach you know in our kindergartens or whatever they want to teach their kids that they're not really boys and girls that they can change their gender that homosexuality is a norm and all that stuff so we we act against gays if that were all gay people you know where gay people are just trying to live their lives so let's let's begin let us begin our journey into how awful feminism is so anyway what I want to talk about is reaction reactionary ISM and how we get lured into saying stupid stuff by the stupid stuff they say and by the normalization of the stupid stuff they say in the mainstream media so the best place to begin if you're talking about the mainstream media is the op-ed page of the New York Times a former newspaper or as we like to call it knucklehead roe knucklehead row it today from Lindy West okay and we know we're gonna think of Lindy West because she is the author of shrill notes from a loud woman so you know they're gonna love this right so Woody Allen also a guy who was alleged to have done some really bad sexual stuff and obviously ran off with his I don't know what you'd call her where she wasn't his stepdaughter exactly but she was the dogged opted daughter of the woman he was living with and he's been rationalizing it ever since and Harvey Weinstein one of the reasons Woody Allen still has a career because people were ready to kill him for this one of the reason he's Harvey Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein and Woody Allen defended Roman Polanski the rapist of a 13 year old child you know I mean it's like they're all in this thing together and Woody Allen has the temerity when he was reacting to Harvey Weinstein he says it's important his first reaction was you know yeah Harvey Weinstein is a sick sad guy I feel sad for him like I don't feel so sad for him but this is Woody Allen but he said it was important to avoid a witch-hunt atmosphere where quote every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself so that's from Woody Allen so Lindy West the author of shrill writes a column on knucklehead Road says yes this is a witch-hunt I'm a witch and I'm hunting you okay that's the column it says when Woody Allen another man warned of a witch-hunt atmosphere a Salem atmosphere what they mean is an atmosphere in which they're expected to comport themselves with the care consideration and fear of consequences that the rest of us call basic professionalism and respect for shared humanity on some level to some men and you can call me a hysteric but I am done mincing words on this there is no injustice quite so unnaturally viscerally grotesque as a white man being fired now what this has to do with white people because by the way a lot of a preponderance of these charges like on college campuses and all this stuff are not against white kids anyway Donald Trump and how he comes into it all right she's bringing Donald Trump our predator in chief seems to view the election of Barack Obama as a white man being fired like you know this is this is like feminists proving that women can't be rational you know as feminists can't be rational he and his supporters are willing to burn the world in revenge this whole catastrophic cultural moment was born of that same entitlement of trumps pause and Weinstein's unbelted bathrobe of the ancient cycles of abuse that go stroked the Trump campaigns real slogan if I can't have you no one will setting aside the gendered power differential inherent in real historical witch-hunts pretty sure it wasn't all the rape victims in Salem getting together to burn the mayor this by the way dum-dum the Salem witch hunts were started by girls girls got hysterical there was a slave named Tituba who stirred them up with stories of voodoo and witch hunts and all this and they got hysterical started to charge people the people who were charged were men and women both when you look at the list of people who were executed and convicted of witchcraft more women than men but plenty of men as well there weren't that many I mean there were two men one is too many but they were weren't that many but anyway that's a stupid feminist mean but hysteria of young girls is what set off the Salem witch Anse anyway the pathetic gall of men feeling hunted after millenniums of treating women like prey now let's stop right there okay because that's sexism that's actual sexism that's like saying they meet the gall of white men protesting against black abuses as if you be by the color of your skin are condemned for bigotry that she's saying after millenniums instead of millennia of went men treating women like prey it is pathetic gall for men to feel hunted but what if the man is innocent each man is an individual so anyway she finally says I will let you guys have this one sure if you insist it's a witch hunt I'm a witch and I'm hunting you but there is a witch hunt I mean feminists have stirred up a witch hunt and they stirred it up from the very beginning they told they told young girls that they should have the same rights as they call it to have anonymous meaningless feeling less sex as and then women started to do that on college campuses and start to think you know what I don't feel so good about myself and then they started to accuse men of raping them who maybe hadn't raped them or at least deserved a fair trial here in California Jerry Brown right one of the poster children of old-fashioned leftism just vetoed a bill you remember that the Trump administration revoked Obama's Dear Colleague letter that was sent out to universities telling them that they basically had to take the word of anybody who accused a man a young man of sexual malfeasance right so the boy no longer had the right to go to the cops if he was accused of rape he went before a kangaroo court what they call now a title nine kangaroo court and he was thrown out of school without any way of defending himself and he's gotten these kids had to sue if they had the money to sue so Trump rightly revoked that order and the California Legislature run by obviously all liberals we don't have any Republicans in California passed a law saying no we're going to reinstate these title nine show trials and Jerry Brown of all people vetoed this bill he said thoughtful legal minds have increasingly questioned whether federal and state actions to prevent and redress sexual harassment and assault well intentioned as they are have also unintentionally resulted in some colleges failure to uphold due process for accused students the due process includes the presumption of being innocent without a trial so anyway all I'm saying is the feminists say all this nasty stuff right Harvey Weinstein spends decades preying on actresses preying on women and now the feminists come out and they've got this hashtag me - have you guys seen this on Twitter this is like every girl who's ever thought that she was abused is now making the stories making a story about me - because god forbid there should be a new story and it's not about you as well so everything is me - it's and it's annoying it is really annoying and so I've started to hear people a lot of people on left and right just people on Twitter but but also commenting saying well you know why didn't these women come forward before they were kind of making a devil's bargain with Harvey Weinstein having their careers and not reporting this and I said from the very beginning I'm not gonna call these women heroic for coming out 20 years after the fact and three Oscars and 15 movies after the fact and saying oh yeah you know I was abused because a lot of other girls were abused in that time that might have been stopped if they had all come out but but I am also you cannot cannot blame the women for not coming out I mean let me let me just start with a hypothetical here for just a minute let's say a girl you care about not you know I didn't make it your daughter say god forbid but let's say she is molested or attacked and she shattered and basically she's looking if she wants to bring an accusation against the guy who did this she is looking in 18 months maybe two years of trial she's looking at expenditures she's looking at going out in public she's looking at testifying you know giving depositions maybe going into a public court case and accusing this guy and here you've got this girl that you love you know she's related to you you're married to her whatever and you know and she says to you I can't do it I've been raped I'm already shattered is gonna take me years to put my life back together I cannot do it are you the are you the guy who's gonna say you know yeah you got to do it because you got to stop the rapist from striking again well you know heroes heroes do that stuff heroes heroines they do that stuff but not you cannot expect people to be heroes that's what makes heroes heroes they are exceptional people that these women should risk their careers you know let's let's go back for a minute remember Lauren Sivan the former Fox host she told this story and I bring this story up first of all because she tells it without sentiment she doesn't break into tears she it's a grotesque story but let her tell it again let's play that 7 clip again he cornered me in this vestibule and leaned in and and tried to kiss me which I immediately rebuffed and said whoa whoa whoa I had no idea that that's what this was I'm sorry you know I have a very serious boyfriend and I'm not interested and I thought it would end there but that's when he the entrance or exit for me and said well then just stand there and be quiet and that's when I realized oh did you know what was about to happen no idea no I did completely shocked and yet what is gonna happen like stand up and stand there I mean quiet I had no idea what was gonna happen and it it happened very quickly and he immediately exposed himself and I you know began pleasuring himself and I just stood there okay okay now what happens if she goes to the cops right you think the cops I mean this is not against the police but it's a he-said she-said operation she hasn't been raped there's nothing there's no DNA on her there's no evidence you know she's going up against one of them a powerful guy with an array of lawyer she's in show business he can destroy her what happens to her if she goes you can't say to her you know go give up your career and you cannot then say oh you know you made a devil's bargain that's ridiculous is absurd the bad guy is the bad guy here and let you know you want to know talk about what happens to women who make accusations let's let's take a look you know Hillary Clinton has been doing this kabuki of outrage about her friend Harvey Weinstein here's who woman who's friends with rvy Singh her best friend is married to a serial abuser she's married to a serial abuser and she's gonna be outraged so no American reporter that I saw questioned her made any comparison to Bill Clinton unfortunately she then went to England and the BBC one of the most leftist organizations there is actually had the guts to ask her the question here's her response this kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere whether it's in entertainment politics you know after all we have someone admitting to being a sexual assault ER in the Oval Office there has to be a recognition that we must stand against this kind of you know action that is so Mis sexist and misogynistic and this depends upon women coming forward the courage to come forward right and yet in your book the three women brought onto stage by Trump at your husband and you kind of dismissed them it was not the right thing to do sure about that well yes because that had all been litigated I mean that was the subject of a huge you know investigation as you might recall in the late 90s and there were conclusions drawn and that was clearly in the past all right we're gonna get that no no no no those women don't count those women don't matter we're gonna get back to what she Hilary personally did to those women in just a second but first let me bring up Trump for just a second because a lot of people on the Left are saying oh you know you're you know you on the right are saying oh Harvey Weinstein shows the corruption of the Democrat Party he does but you've got this guy in in the White House who has done all these bad things and a lot of people on the right here again reactionary a lot of people on the right are saying well you know they have that Access Hollywood tape but he didn't do anything on there he just said stuff look he's been charged by a lot of women too and obviously nothing's been proved he is also an alleged guy but look into your heart for a minute I mean come on and you look at Donald Trump I am sure that Donald Trump has done some truly offensive and disgusting things I don't think he's a rapist I don't believe he's a rapist he doesn't it strike me as that kind of got but I'm sure he's been very handsy with a lot of women and I'm sure he is not clean in this you know I don't think he should be you know impeached for anything he did before he came into the White House but I'm not going to make excuses for him either you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do it I'm not gonna react these guys are out of line they are abusive they're treating women abominably and they treat people this is the other thing about Harvey Ising he treated people Obama but let's talk about the women who came out against Hillary Clinton because this is what I'm talking about Linda bloodworth-thomason right she is the TV writer she did designing women a very successful TV writer big big friend of Bill and Hillary okay she she writes in The Hollywood Reporter as more and more women have come forward a listers who are normally intrepid social injustice sniffers have scrambled to condemn weinstein and announced they had no idea all this was going on some said this despite knowing him for decades starring in his films and being friends with accusers who starred in his films okay whatever I myself she says was a member of a let's bring Harvey Weinstein down lunch club and I don't even work in features however I will be the first to admit that clearly delineated moral choices can still be painfully complex where friendship has involved one of the best friends I will ever have in a man I love dearly former President Bill Clinton has certainly taxed my feminist conscience but always without diminishing my affection I even helped write his apology to the nation for his own sexual misconduct was sitting next to him when he delivered it and believed to this day it was based on something that was none of our business namely his affair with Monica Lewinsky because obviously it would there was they were both willing even though the power differential was absurd she says yes someday some may call it hypocritical but I confess to having had no problem warning at least three top-level Democratic operatives against allowing Harvey Weinstein to host political fundraisers a warning that evidently fell on deaf ears so Hilary knew if Linda if Linda Thomason was was talking about this to Democrats and she's best friends with Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton knew about Harvey Weinstein too so all that stuff is just absolute nonsense and while we're talking this is the other thing these women come for and they oh it's all consensual it's all consensual she chased me she chased me here are the three women that the BBC guy was talking about Paula Jones Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broderick Juanita Broderick says she was raped Kathleen Willey well I'll come back let me come back to Kathleen Willey because that's a story in and of itself but here are the three of them detailing the things that we're done to them in an interview with Breitbart this is cut number you got it yep rape physical sexual assault sexual harassment I want to say this to the mainstream media Andrea Mitchell Jake Tapper all of these people these are not infidelity a rape is not an infidelity these are crying any other people would be in jail yes state would be in jail for a very long time this is not any this is no longer about infidelities indiscretions girlfriends sex interns none of those this is about a serial rapist a predator and his wife who has enabled his behaviors all of these years she's taking personal betrayals and turn them into political opportunities and it's just that yeah we three years expose himself to me that's a crime they're not supposed to expose yourself to these are not in Belem so all right so that's that's Kathleen Willey and I'll talk some more about her what happened to her in just a second I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire calm and you can hear the rest and we've got the mailbag coming up so you got to be there because otherwise you're gonna still have the same problems you have right now if you come on over to subscribe for a lousy ten bucks a month you can be in the mailbag and I will solve all your problems it will be a brand new day so Kathleen Willey was when Clinton was in the Oval Office she visited him in the Oval Office she was in trouble her husband was in financial trouble she didn't know it but even as this was happening I believe as I recall the story he had he was found dead of a gunshot wound that is has been deemed suicide she has sometimes expressed suspicions that the Clintons had him killed she went to Bill Clinton for help he chased her around the room molested her all this stuff later when she came out and she was a ardent Democrat in an ardent friend of Bill later when she came out and exposed him she said she said that her cat disappeared she went out and a man was on the street and said to her basically how's your cat a stranger and she said what do you mean and he started asking her about her children by name and then said you know you're just not getting them the message okay that's what happens to people what you know this is real stuff this is real stuff and it happens listen well you know what I'll just show you Alun member Allen combs the late Alan Cohen who was you know was Hannity and Colmes when Hannity started out on Fox TV combs was the liberal guy since the way combs treated wiling when she's Willie when she started told this story you mentioned the subpoena subpoena after all this he'll be put up on the screen with Robert Ray said and have been having investigated the situation the Independent Counsel he said Willie's testimony of the grand jury about the alleged incident differed materially from your deposition testimony given in Jones versus Clinton you said at your deposition that Clinton did not final you the final report of the Independent Counsel in Madison guarantee savings and loan regarding Monica Lewinsky and others that there was a difference in the things you said in those two difference appearances why would Robert Gregg say had an agenda yes he wanted to run for Senate from New Jersey when this was over he thought that you know he needed food it wasn't no liberal he wasn't a Democrat he also got arrested for stalking a woman - not many years ago so I'm just saying you know you go on TV and you're making charges against powerful people powerful people are gonna cross-examine you and listen women lie the reason they lie they're people people lie so sometimes the accusations that's why we have to have the presumption of innocence I'm not saying that that everybody who comes out and says something should be believed I'm simply saying that when you start to blame these women because you get so angry at the feminists from mouthing off when you start to blame the women for not coming forward earlier you're losing the plot you're losing the moral plot when you start to defend Donald Trump because you like what he's doing politically I like what he's doing politically I'm really happy he's so much better than I feared he was gonna be I'm really happy with what he's doing politically I am NOT gonna defend him I'm not gonna become one of the Clinton Clinton Knights who defended Bill Clinton for what he was doing because they wanted to protect abortion rights and so on I'm not gonna become a guy who defends Donald Trump for stuff he did to women that that's not happening you know that shouldn't it you got to remember if you gotta remember who you are you gotta remember who we are right you know and and by the way I just want to also say the reason another reason this is not a feminist issue this is a human issue there's an issue about power this is an issue about powers an issue about people abusing power if there's one thing conservatives should be against if there was anything at the top of the list the Conservatives should be against it's people abusing power what are we doing here if not trying to break up the centers of power so people don't abuse them why are we so meaning that we're against welfare why are we so mean that we're against government health care's because we know that when people have power they abuse it and that's why you cannot be taken down this garden path of reactionary behavior where you start to defend or attack the people who have been abused by the more powerful and the thing I wanted to say is that there is a huge huge gay pedophilia problem in Hollywood too we know this because actor after actor after actor has come out Elijah Wood is that the guy's name Elijah Wood said that that was there and of course Corey Feldman has come out and made a big fuss about it and this was making people very nervous that we're writing a variety about how Hollywood guys were getting very nervous but these guys are powerful and they are mean I mean they are rich they've got lawyers they've got people who are not lawyers who are much nastier than lawyers these are mean guys and so listen to what happened to Corey Feldman she goes on with Barbara Walters another like one of the icons of the left listen what happens to him when he goes on and tells the story in the view I'm saying that there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey that are still working they're still out there and there's some of the richest most powerful people in this business saying what I'm saying right now are you saying that they're pedophiles yes yeah and that's what you're saying in your book when you talk to about yeah when you talked to Perry here right now there are a lot of parents out here who want to put their kids in this in this business their kids are cute they're great actors to do that what would you say to a parent who just has the best of intentions who's coming here with their child you're saying that there's a lot of predators in this industry it's a many feathered bird okay be careful what you wish for that's what I'll tell you you know don't go into it with naivety don't go into it thinking that it's all roses and I'm just trying to say that it's a very important serious time he's apologized you system you're damaging an entire industry he's telling her about kids being raped you know it she's not saying oh my god the house is on fire we got to do something about it you know let me just end this all I'm trying to say is I know the feminists are annoying I know they take stories like this and they turn them around and they make every man guilty and they poison the atmosphere and they poison the atmosphere between men and women and they make you know men walk in fear and it's just disgusting it has nothing to do with men and women it is only about power and power does manifest itself between men and women in different ways but this is all about the abuse of power and we as conservatives have got to stand with the people who are being abused not with the powerful not with the people who are abusing the powerful I just want to end on one note this woman who did come out before the Harvey Weinstein thing her name is Kaia Jones she was one of the Pussycat Dolls you know obviously he's not my kind of music not what it what what I know about but she is a follower of Christ she came out and she said that she just could not stand the way you know it's really touching because girls little girls they love these bands these power bands are the Spice Girls and all this stuff and they represent glamor and power to little girls but she said that they were first of all she said that basically they were being used as prostitutes they were being told if they wanted a career they had to sleep with anybody they were told to sleep with she said they were being used to sell abortion the ideas of abortion used to sell all these left-wing ideas and she talks about why she eventually left and walked away from it very touching little story let's let's hear her going on and it wasn't in front of the camera I was okay with being a sexy powerful young girl like a spice girl if you will which was my you know my growing up there were my idols and I had this like crazy wacky moment you know where I was performing at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Vegas and her divas live and Patti LaBelle's wailing and we're going on after Patti LaBelle and there was these two little girls in the front row and I was coming through the audience only me and one other girl the rest of them are coming up on Reiser and their two little girls and one was like four years old and she went huh she's pissed II can tell she was so excited to to see us and that was a reaction to me and I just knew in that moment I couldn't do it you know cuz this isn't this isn't what I would want any little girl to be what we was being pushed on us and what I was going through at that moment in time and what we had just endured backstage and so it was a lot of the back ends that I wasn't okay with okay so there's there's somebody who remembered who she is and we have to remember who we are I mean I really I know the feminists are annoying but we cannot blame the women in this I'm not saying they're heroes for coming out 20 years later I'm just saying they're victims there they are the victims of of of alleged abuser Harvey Weinstein and we got to gotta remember who the bad guys and good guys are the mailbag oh they're little slow Lyndsey uptake there but alright from Benjamin Andrew over the past year so I've noticed my sister who is 19 has become very depressed and gained about a hundred pounds although the weight gain is the result of the depression not the cause I think I believe that dropping some weight would be a great help to her confidence and in turn hopefully her mental health that being said I simply can't get her to do it even when she has time her responses I don't feel like it or some variation thereof any advice am I going about this wrong and I'm overstepping my boundaries as a brother thanks Ben well first of all Ben I'm really happy you care about her I'm glad you are you know paying attention to the fact that she's depressed yes you were going about this wrong people who are overweight don't need you to tell them they were overweight they know they were overweight they feel bad about it already nagging them doesn't help bothering them about it doesn't help they already know the problem it sounds to me like she is depressed and that is a different problem and that is a problem you can help her with in a number of ways first of all go to her and talk to her about a depression stay off the weight thing it's none of your business and it's not it just isn't helping go and talk to her about why she's depressed sometimes sometimes people who are depressed just need somebody to talk to them because something has happened or they're worried about something or there's got something on their minds and just being with them and listening to them and hearing them out can really help if in your judgement you think that it's worse than that that something really bad is happening in gaining a hundred pounds is a bad symptom you know then she may need therapy she may need to go and talk to somebody professionally who can help her but attack the depression not the weight and be with her and talk to her and don't judge her don'tyou don't have to ask you don't have to solve her problems you don't have to solve her problems you just have to hear what her problems are and listen to her and spend some time with her I'm glad you care about her it's really it's it's great that you care about her but bugging her about her weight isn't gonna help from Jena supreme leader Clavin I read your book the great good thing and loved it I'm that's nice to hear and I hope everyone who's listening will read the great good thing and love it it is my memoir of how I became a Christian it's called the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ I was wondering if you could give more insight into the practice of prayer I have gotten into a lifelong bad habit of only praying to God when I need something how do I change this thank you yeah you know prayer is the bulwark of everything I think it is one of the most important things you can do in your day and I've said this before I did a funny video about this once find God in 60 days and what I said is look find some time every day even if it's only 5 to 10 minutes in which you can be alone and talk to God out loud and the reason I say out loud is because you finish your sentences when you talk out loud and when you only think things to yourself the sentences trail off and get kind of you get distracted you go into daydream mode but if you're speaking out loud then you know you can hear you can follow your own thoughts and my personal policy you know is let it be a journey of exploration don't pray in ways that you think you're supposed to pray pray talk to God God he already knows he already knows there's nothing so bad you can't tell him because he already knows right you got no secrets if you're in a place no place where you got no secrets you got no power you got nothing you got nothing you are going to God you know you can say just about anything you want even if you're angry at God even if you're feeling something you don't feel you should be feeling all those things are already exposed you're already exposed to go and talk to them didn't talk to them about the things you care about with the things you want the things you desire the things that bother you the things you're afraid of talk to him about your real life this is not a ritual this is not religion I think one of the things that I think Jesus came to do was destroy religion you know people are always you know people religious people religious authorities are always railing against you know drinking and sax and sin and all this stuff read the Gospels Jesus doesn't do that so much you know who he rails against religious authorities and he really he goes after he rips the religious authority continually and he said and he says to them you slam the door in the face of you slam the door to heaven in the face of people don't let this happen to you as the old saying goes so gently go and talk to them talk to them every day you know you know like even if it's 5-10 minutes if you do it alone out loud you will find your life will change and for the better you know that so you're talking to me maybe it'll be for the better talking to God it'll be for the better it is it is I think essential I would rather if I had to give up going to church or praying I would give up going to church luckily I don't have to do either but that would be the first thing to go alright from Becky sorry yes I used to attend the occasional tea party event several years ago but was never clear on why the tea party died out a left-leaning friend suggested that the movement had been hijacked by the Republican Party but I wasn't sure if that was correct what in your opinion happened to the tea party thanks Becky well here's what happened in my opinion first of all Barack Obama did a really good job of suppressing the tea party through the IRS he really hounded them he didn't let them get tax-exempt status so they couldn't raise money he really made it difficult for them to talk out plus I know for a fact that the mainstream Republicans the Republic all the GOP the GOP establishment was actively hostile toward them I spoke with some of the leaders of Congress in a a private setting I one of them I will tell you was Boehner I talked to them and they basically said we're gonna use these people and ride their wave without giving them what they want basically that's what they did and the Tea Party started out started to try and recruit candidates we talked about this a little bit yesterday they got people who couldn't make it on the national stage that was very disappointing I think now what has happened is they have been subsumed into the Donald Trump movement I think Donald Trump has picked up all those Tea Party votes I think the reason people turn to Donald Trump is because guys like Boehner weren't listening to them weren't hearing what they were Mitch McConnell was constantly hitting the Tea Party he would say well I'm hitting the Tea Party because they're not really a lot of people are going under the aegis of the Tea Party without being Tea Party but I basically think they are now the Trump movement I think the people who were the Tea Party are the Trump movement they were I loved the Tea Party but I do think that they were a little bit inchoate they were a little bit in chaos and they didn't really know how to make the organization plus the press in the United States who's the most powerful agency in the country to suppress them the IRS from here's that greatness guy named storm I wrote I read a novel called the uncanny with a guy named storm I always like hey Big Daddy drew who I don't think I have that business card in the name of October and the ghoulish holiday of Halloween what are some classic movies you recommend watching great question I have said this a million times but I'll say it again I'm not a horror movie fan I am a ghost story fan I love ghost stories I love creepy stories I don't really love bloody stories the one big exception is the original Night of the Living Dead which is one of the most terrifying movies I ever saw and it is gory beyond anything my the films that I love are subtle and every time I say this people immediately go to the others with Nicole Kidman but I don't like the others because it's not scary it's subtle but it's not scary try a movie called the innocence you know modern audial from modern audience very subtle but it's based on a great great Henry James short story short novella called the turn of the screw about it's been made about 15 times I mean it's been made into movies like a dozen times but the innocence is written by Truman Capote and it's got Deborah Carr and it is just great it is about a it's about a governess a British governor sent to a house to take care of two kids and what happens when she gets there that is a good movie another one you may not have seen is called Lake Mungo that is a I think it's I think it's New Zealand maybe Australia but it's New Zealand's Lake Mungo it is a found-footage picture like paranormal activity very spooky little ghost story paranormal activity also a great movie the ring great ghost story movie those are famous ones so I'm not mentioning those also there is a movie called horror hotel and it's about I would say the first 20 to 25 minutes are some of the scariest things I've ever heard it's that's not the name of it can you look it up for a minute Austin because it's got a British name to that what City of the Dead I think that's it yeah but anyway for 20 to 25 minutes it's absolutely great and then it falls apart it kind of unravels but it's not terrible but it just kind of unravels one more I will do one more question yeah Christopher Lee isn't it yeah no it no it's a terrific is it the first 20 I saw when I was 10 years old it kept me up for weeks I mean I could not go to sleep for weeks and but it's it's really scary when it starts and then that falls apart but those are good Halloween some good Halloween movies I love reading ghost stories if you haven't read The Little Stranger the novel Little Stranger that's a very good one too and of course there's Shirley Jackson the haunting of Hill House which became the movie the haunting also a good movie not the new one the old one the one made in the 1960s is black and white the haunting also very very good ghost story movie from Ryan dear Overlord Clavin first of his name king of the normies and best among men my wife and I have been married for nine days congratulations I know she would like to one day have children I however would not I can't I'll tell you why I'm laughing I'm an I cannot seem to come to terms with financial and emotional burden this would put on our relationship I cherish what we have and fear change should I accept the Lord's word and just to have children or foster our relationship and offer our Lord along happy marriage in his well well don't let's not drag God into this between your wife you're writing me the reason I'm laughing is you're writing me ten days too late didn't you talk did you guys talk about this before you got married I mean don't you talk to the girl you're gonna marry about whether you want to have children or not I mean obviously obviously you should not have children if you don't want them you don't want to bring unwanted children into the world I would I would argue if I were like your buddy I would argue with you that fearing you know what's there's an old expression my father used to like every child comes with it who comes into the world bearing its own loaf of bread and it is true when your children arrive you take care of them you learn you you make the money that you need you know I I love kids I loved having kids I found that having kids added a third dimension to life I had thought I was living in three dimensions after I children I thought no I all that time I was living in two dimensions and I only saw reality I only knew what it meant to be a human being I only know what it meant to be a man but if you don't want to do it do not do it but he got to talk to your wife about this because she may not want to spend her whole life childless she may really want those kids and you may have to make a decision there I mean maybe you know it's all your only knockin days in maybe he's got a bed but he really should have talked her about this ten days ago before you got married so I think she should know I mean she should know and you shouldn't let yourself be talked into having children you don't want I would definitely reconsider but I think you've got to let her know that that's where you are a lot of good questions I got to stop that's just all there is to it I have got to stop all right good mailbag we'll do it again next week you know it's time for tickety-boo news before we leave all right I was gonna do I was gonna do a long story about the Russian scandal there's a new story and the hill today about the fact that before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery kickbacks extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin's atomic energy business inside the United States according to government documents and interviews great story in the hill you should look it up we want to see that but I have to I just want to point out tickety-boo news is about ways to read the news yesterday Tucker Carlson had Glenn Greenwald on and Glenn Greenwald is a fiercely left-wing writer for The Guardian and they were talking about a Russian and the latest Russian story which has turned out to be nothing which was that the Russians hacked some of our voting machines and this was got big headlines and then again turned out to be untrue virtually every story about the Russians insofar as it involved Donald Trump turned out to be untrue and Tucker Carlson said you know the press is being manipulated and Greenwald the tucker carlson obviously on the right and greenwald on the left he said said they're not being manipulated they like being manipulated and here's why and gave one of the best descriptions about how modern journalism works listen to this over and over they publish really inflammatory stories that turn out to be totally false and what happens in those cases nothing they get enormous benefits when they publish recklessly they get applause on social media from their peers they get zillions of retweets huge amounts of traffic they end up on TV they get applauded across the spectrum because people are so giddy and eager to hear more about this Russia and Trump story and when their stories get completely debunked it just kind of everybody agrees to ignore it and it moot everyone moves on and they pay no price at the same time they're feeding and pleasing their sources by publishing these stories of their sources want them to publish and so there's huge amounts of career benefits and reputational benefits and very little cost when they publish stories that end up being debunked because the narrative they're serving is a popular one at least within their peer circles well that's good for Glenn Greenwald I mean he is an actual left-wing journalist you know he's left-wing but he is an actual journalist and he doesn't like seeing his profession being degraded which is is being and part of it is because of this niche culture we're living in where we all sort of stay in the same news I often joke that you know some of these things some of these apps that curate the news for you I start out reading conservative news and finally they start feeding back articles I wrote so I'm literally talking to myself you know so so I think in in that system the New York Times can publish good left-wing journalism and bad left-wing journalism and they never suffer for it the one thing they can't do is attack left-wing Democrat politicians because then they lose their readership and since this is a business nobody wants to do it every time I open my mouth and say oh you know Donald Trump probably did chase some women around the room you know the people who love Trump and don't want to hear of any bad things about him are gonna leave that is supposed to encourage me to keep my mouth shut which obviously I don't but still but still you know that that is a very big very big motivating force in journalism today is having the people who love you love you and what Greenwald is saying is right now on the left that is just the engine a powerful engine behind the spate of fake news this hate that is coming after Trump the only thing I can say is I think they're making a mistake because I don't think most people in America want to live in a cesspool of hate even against Donald Trump even if they don't like Donald Trump all right we'll be back again I think lease Smith is coming on tomorrow excellent excellent writer this is a 400 episodes really see if Lindsey were here there'd be balloons there'd be like confetti confetti all I get
