>> THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW FLYING
TO ORLANDO, FLORIDA, TO GIVE A
SPEECH AT A POLICE CONVENTION.
HE HAS A SPECIAL GUEST ON
AIR FORCE ONE, DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN.
OH, THIS IS GOING TO GET
INTERESTING BREED THIS COMES
AFTER LAST MONTH'S
"NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT THAT
ROSENSTEIN HAD DISCUSSED
SECRETLY RECORDING THE PRESIDENT
AND POSSIBLY REMOVING HIM FROM
OFFICE UNDER THE 25TH AMENDMENT.
ROSENSTEIN DENIES THAT REPORT.
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT THIS
MORNING.
>> President Trump: ON THE
PLANE -- I ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP, OTHER THAN THERE
HAS BEEN NO COLLUSION, FOLKS.
NO COLLUSION.
NO, I DON'T.
I DIDN'T KNOW ROD BEFORE.
BUT I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW HIM,
AND I GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH
HIM.
B5 ROSENSTEIN EXPECTED MEET WITH
WHITE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ON
THURSDAY.
HERE'S HOUSE COMMITTEE DEVIN
NUNES WITH HIS QUESTIONS.
>> I THINK IT ALL COMES DOWN TO
WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS WILLING TO
WEAR A WIRE OR NOT.
IF HE WAS WILLING TO WEAR A WIRE
AND SECRETLY RECORD THE
PRESIDENT, MARIA, SOMEPLACE OF
THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER BEEN
BEFORE, I DON'T KNOW IF ANY TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY
WHERE YOU HAD PEOPLE AT THE
TOP LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT
CONSPIRING TO SECRETLY RECORD A
PRESIDENT SO THAT YOU CAN TRAP
THE PRESIDENT INTO DOING -- INTO
BEING ABLE TO GO AFTER THE 25TH
AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE
PRESIDENT.
>> Kennedy: 'S MEETING ALSO
COMES AFTER FORMER TOUGH FBI
OFFICIAL DAVIS BAKER TOLD
INVESTIGATORS LAST WEEK THAT A
DNC-LINK TO A LAWYER WAS TO THE
AGENCY PRIOR TO ITS LAUNCH OF AN
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 2016
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
CONGRESSMAN KNEW THIS HAS THIS
TO SAY ABOUT THAT -- >> AND I
HAVE ONE OF THE TOP LAWYERS FOR
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAM
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAA
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAG
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAN
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAW
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAO
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAW
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAS
FEEDING INFORMATION DIRECTLY
THE
TOP LAWYER AT THE FBI.
BEFORE EVEN FISA WARRANT.
SO NOW YOU HAVE ABSOLUTE PROOF
THAT THAT WASN'T TOLD TO THE
FISA COURTS.
YOU WANT YOUR EVIDENCE OF FISA
ABUSE?
THERE IT IS, RIGHT THERE.
>> Kennedy: NANCY PELOSI SAYS
THAT SHE WANTS THE 302S.
DEVIN NUNES ONCE ALL THIS
INFORMATION REGARDING FUSION GPS
AND ANY SORT OF INTERFACE THEY
HAD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE OR FBI OFFICIALS.
ARE WE GOING TO GET TO SEE ANY
OF THIS?
>> Steve: I DON'T KNOW, BUT
I'M SORT OF REMINDED -- WITH ALL
OF THE KAVANAUGH CONTROVERSY IN
THE PAST FEW WEEKS, THAT WHOLE
RUSSIA CONVERSATION STILL HASN'T
GONE AWAY.
ALL THESE NAMES MAKING HISTORY
NOW.
PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE, HOW
LONG IS THAT SINCE WE TALKED
ABOUT THEM?
>> I ENJOYED THE BREAK.
>> Steve: ME TOO, FRANK LEE.
DEVIN NUNES -- ON YOUR QUESTION,
YES, WE SHOULD GET THE
INFORMATION.
IT'S QUITE CLEAR TO ME.
I THINK EVERYONE WATCHING THIS,
THERE ARE CERTAINLY GROUNDS FOR
SUSPICION.
THE PERMANENT BUREAUCRACY, THE
OBAMA HOLDOVER, BOTH BEFORE THE
ELECTION AND AFTER, UP TO NO
GOOD.
HOW ABOUT, HOW SERIOUS WE ARE.
WE NEED THE INFORMATION.
THE SOMETHING TO INVESTIGATE.
TO HIS POINT ON ROSENSTEIN, I
DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S
TALKING ABOUT.
IT'S NOT WHETHER HE ACTUALLY
WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF
WEARING A WIRE OR NOT.
THE FACT THAT HE WAS EVEN
THINKING ABOUT IT, TALKING ABOUT
IT, DISCUSSING IT, SHOWS THAT
HE'S TOTALLY DISLOYAL AND HAS NO
PLACE BEING IN THE
ADMINISTRATION.
HOWEVER, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S QUITE
INTERESTING WHAT HE'S DOING.
IT FEELS AS IF, PRIOR TO THIS
REVELATION AND THIS REPORT IN
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," ROSENSTEIN
WAS IN QUITE A STRONG POSITION
WITH RESPECT TO THE PRESIDENT
BECAUSE HE WAS BASICALLY THERE
UNFIREABLE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
AN OUTRAGE IF YOU DO THAT.
NOW HIS POSITION IS MUCH, MUCH
WEAKER BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN
REVEALED.
>> AND LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
>> Steve: AND THE PRESIDENT IS
PROBABLY SAYING "ACTUALLY, I'VE
GOT A SKY WHERE I WANT HIM NOW.
HE IS MUCH MORE VULNERABLE THAN
HE WAS BEFORE."
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY, IT SEEMS
LIKELY, HE'S NOT GOING TO --
>> STEVE BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT.
IN THAT CONTEXT, WHEN YOU'RE IN
A PRIVATE TEXT TO CHANGE WITH
YOUR PARAMORE OR YOUR FRIEND, I
THINK YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
YOU CAN SAY "HEY, THIS WAS A
PERSONAL JOKE BETWEEN TWO
PEOPLE.
I DON'T HAVE TO DESCRIBE ANY OF
THIS."
BUT WHEN YOU ARE IN A WORK
CONTEST AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THINGS LIKE REMOVING THE
PRESIDENT VIA THE 25TH
AMENDMENT, OR SECRETLY EITHER
WEARING A WIRE OR HAVING SOMEONE
ELSE WEARING A WIRE, THAT IS NOT
NECESSARILY FUNNY.
YOU ARE IN A WORK SETTING.
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT IS
OFF-LOADING SOME OF THAT HEAVY
LIFTING TO CONGRESS.
THEY CAN HAVE THOSE TOUGH
QUESTIONS.
>> Harris: THAT'S A
POSSIBILITY.
I DO THINK THAT IT'S
INTERESTING, AS STEVE POINTS
OUT, THAT NOW THE LEVERAGE IS
GONE FOR ROSENSTEIN.
HE IS IN A POSITION OF
CAPITULATION, REALLY.
AND NOW HE'S ON AIR FORCE ONE.
YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD
SAY FRONT OF YOUR BOSS AND WE
WOULDN'T SAY.
YOU'VE HEARD ALL SORTS OF
THINGS.
YOU BROUGHT UP THAT IT'S NOT
FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A
JOKE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
JOKE ABOUT THAT.
THAT IS THE SAME SORT OF
NARRATIVE THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN
STRZOK AND PAGE.
GET RID OF THE PRESIDENT BEFORE
HE'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
IS IT A QUESTION OF BIAS?
I AM CERTAIN THAT WOULD COME UP,
AT LEAST WITH CONGRESS.
DOES IT COME UP ON AIR FORCE ON
AIR FORCE ONE?
>> WHAT HAPPENS CHRIS MARKEY IS
OBVIOUSLY IN A PLACE WERE ROD
ROSENSTEIN CAN'T JUST SLAM THE
DOOR AND WALK OUT OF AN
UNCOMFORTABLE MEETING.
>> EXACTLY.
>> HE'S GOING TO NEED A
PARACHUTE.
>> I THINK IT'LL ACTUALLY BE FAR
MORE CORDIAL AND FRIENDLY --
>> WHAT YOU THINK THE POINT OF
IT AS?
>> Harris: WHAT LEVERAGE GOES
BACK AND FORTH?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS
ALSO ENJOYED A FEW WEEKS BREAK
FROM THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.
HE ALREADY SAID, "I THINK YOU
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
HIS A GOOD MAN."
HE NEEDS TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE
MIDTERMS.
I THINK HIS TEAM HAS MADE IT
CLEAR TO HIM, YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY
UPHEAVALS ON THE MUELLER SIDE OF
THINGS.
GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS,
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE G.O.P. HAS
GOTTEN A BOOST OUT OF THE
KAVANAUGH HEARING.
IF HE GOES AND HE FIRE SOMEONE
LIKE SESSIONS OR ROD ROSENSTEIN,
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PUBLIC OPINION
POLLS ON THIS, YOU WILL INFLAME
A PART OF THE COUNTRY, THE
INDEPENDENCE THAT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN ON YOUR SIDE --
>> Harris: BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO INVITE HIM ON AIR FORCE ONE.
THAT'S --
>> Jessica: I THINK IT'S TO
SAY "I'M IN CHARGE.
HE WORKS FOR ME, HE COMES INTO
MY FANCY CAR THE SCRIBE.
AND WE DO THINGS ON MY TERMS."
BUT I THINK IT WILL BE VERY LIKE
"YOU LIKE DIET COKE?
I LIKE TO COOK."
>> Lisa: OR CHOCOLATE CAKE, OR
MAYBE ICE CREAM.
THOSE ARE ALL DELICIOUS THINGS
AND I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT TRUM
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I THINK HE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
AFTER THE MIDTERMS AND FIRE HIM.
I DON'T TRUST THE GUY.
HE LAYS OF THE CASE FOR FIRING
JAMES COMEY, AND THEN HE
APPOINTS A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO
LOOK INTO THE FIRING OF JAMES
COMEY.
THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME, IT'S
SUPER SKETCHY.
ANOTHER THING THAT IS SUPER
SKETCHY IS INFORMATION ABOUT
JAMES BAKER, WHO WAS HIS TOP FBI
ATTORNEY AT THE HEART OF THE
SURVEILLANCE.
NOW WE KNOW HE MET WITH THE
DEMOCRAT PARTY ATTORNEY.
A MEETING THAT HE DESCRIBED AS
ATYPICAL.
WEEKS BEFORE THEY LAUNCHED THE
SURVEILLANCE INTO CARTER PAGE
AND THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE
TRIM CAMPAIGN.
REMEMBER, ALSO, WE KNOW THAT THE
DOSSIER WAS USED TO OBTAIN A
FISA WARRANT, WHICH IS AN
OPPOSITION PIECE OF RESEARCH
STILL UNVERIFIED AND EVEN
CHRISTOPHER STEELE HAS ADMITTED
IN A LONDON COURT THAT PARTS OF
IT ARE FALSE AND FICTITIOUS.
>> MIND YOU, WE ARE STILL AT A
POINT WHERE CARTER PAGE IS NOT
BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING AND
NOT A SINGLE PERSON ON THE TRUMP
SIDE HAS BEEN TIED TO ANY SORT
OF COLLUSION.
WE ARE HERE AND LOOKING AT ALL
THE SKETCHY THINGS COMING
TOGETHER.
>> Steve: VERY QUICKLY, I
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU BUT YOU
HAVE TO BE FIRED.
YOU CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION
WHERE SOMEBODY SO SENIOR AND SO
CLEARLY DISLOYAL, PLOTTING
AGAINST THE HEAD OF THE --
>> I THINK WITH THE PRESIDENT
DOES, HERE, IF HE KEEPS HIM
UNTIL AFTER THE MIDTERMS.
HE'S ONLY GOT A MONTH.
>> HE KEEPS THEM CLOSE.
>> THAN HE ALLOWS CONGRESS TO
ASK THOSE QUESTIONS, LAY THE
CASE OUT, GET SOME ANSWERS FROM
HIM, SHOW BLATANT HYPOCRISY, AND
THEN HE WILL HAVE GROUNDS TO
FIRE HIM.
>> Harris: LESSON LEARNED FROM
JAMES COMEY?
>> Kennedy: WE HAVE LEARNED SO
MANY LESSONS FROM HIM.
HE WROTE THIS GREAT BOOK --
>> Harris: HILLARY CLINTON
WOULD HAVE FIRED COMEY RIGHT OUT
THE GATE.
