00:00:01,121 --> 00:00:03,289
JUAN WILLIAMS, BRIAN KILMEADE.

2
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:09,629
A CROUTON IS HER LOOFAH.

3
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:10,363
DANA PERINO.

4
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:12,432
>> CHAIRMAN KIM AND I SIGNED A

5
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:13,133
JOINT STATEMENT IN WHICH HE

6
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,901
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING

7
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:16,669
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE

8
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:18,571
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

9
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:20,440
PENINSULA.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,076
>> Greg: THEY INTERRUPTED

11
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,244
"THE BACHELORETTE" FOR THAT?

12
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:26,012
THIS IS BIG NEWS BUT IT'S ONLY A

13
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:26,479
START.

14
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:28,681
A FIRST DATE, IF YOU WILL.

15
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,682
VERIFICATION IS KEY, FOR IN THE

16
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,951
PAST MONTH GRAY HAS BEEN ABOUT

17
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,287
AS TRUSTWORTHY AS SUSHI FROM THE

18
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:36,856
DRUGSTORE ON A THURSDAY IN THE

19
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:37,457
SUMMERTIME.

20
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:39,325
MAYBE THAT PAST IS DEAD.

21
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:41,327
CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE TRAILER

22
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:42,395
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESENTED TO

23
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:44,063
KIM.

24
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:49,302
>> DESTINY PICTURES PRESENTS A

25
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:49,903
STORY OF OPPORTUNITY.

26
00:00:49,903 --> 00:00:52,272
A NEW STORY, A NEW BEGINNING.

27
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:55,241
ONE OF PEACE.

28
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:59,245
TWO MEN, TWO LEADERS.

29
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:00,446
ONE DESTINY.

30
00:01:00,446 --> 00:01:02,182
A STORY ABOUT A SPECIAL MOMENT

31
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:05,251
IN TIME WHEN A MAN IS PRESENTED

32
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,419
WITH ONE CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER

33
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:09,656
BE REPEATED.

34
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:10,190
WHAT WILL HE CHOOSE?

35
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,059
VISION AND LEADERSHIP?

36
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:13,960
OR NOT?

37
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,865
A NEW WORLD CAN BEGIN TODAY.

38
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:21,367
ONE OF FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT, AND

39
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,269
GOODWILL.

40
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:26,272
BE PART OF THAT WORLD WHERE THE

41
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,440
DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE READY

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,741
TO BE OPENED.

43
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:29,175
>> Greg: OKAY.

44
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:32,579
THAT'S AMAZING.

45
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,247
IT'S GOT TO BE A FIRST.

46
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:34,981
SHOWING A WORLD LEADER WITH THE

47
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,051
WORLD COULD BE LIKE IF YOU

48
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:38,651
CHANGE YOUR WAYS.

49
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:41,054
AS A MOVIE TRAILER, WHO DOES

50
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:42,789
THIS?

51
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,323
DONALD TRUMP.

52
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:44,457
WHY?

53
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:45,859
WHY DID HE SHOW HIM THIS?

54
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,460
>> I SHOWED IT BECAUSE THAT'S

55
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:47,861
THE FUTURE.

56
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:49,762
THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE

57
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,264
FUTURE.

58
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,832
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS JUST

59
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:54,767
NOT A VERY GOOD ALTERNATIVE.

60
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,436
>> Greg: NOT AT ALL!

61
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:58,671
IT'S ABOUT TWO OPTIONS.

62
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,772
THE GOLDEN OFF-RAMP OVER THE

63
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:01,774
CLIFF TO NOWHERE.

64
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:02,609
IT'S NOT POLITICS.

65
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:03,877
IT'S PERSUASION.

66
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,311
IT REFRAMES THE FUTURES OF THE

67
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:06,312
PAST IS THE PAST.

68
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,848
THIS IS IN THINKING OUTSIDE THE

69
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:09,115
BOX.

70
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:12,986
IT'S GETTING RID OF THE BOX.

71
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:13,853
JUMP TO THE SALES PRESENTATION

72
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:14,254
ON FREEDOM.

73
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:16,189
NO ONE HAS DONE THAT BEFORE.

74
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,992
WILL KIM DO WHAT'S RIGHT?

75
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:21,194
>> I THINK HE'S GOING TO DO

76
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:21,628
THESE THINGS.

77
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:22,128
I MAY BE WRONG.

78
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:23,062
I MAY STAND BEFORE YOU IN SIX

79
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,664
MONTHS AND SAY HEY, I WAS WRONG.

80
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:27,333
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WILL EVER

81
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,436
ADMIT THAT BUT I WILL FIND SOME

82
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:31,671
KIND OF AN EXCUSE.

83
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:32,572
>> Greg: THAT IS TRANSPARENCY.

84
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,707
THEY SHOULD FEEL LIKE GOOD NEWS,

85
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:36,242
BUT IF YOU STILL BELIEVE THE

86
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,710
SUMMIT WAS ITSELF A CONFESSION

87
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,512
BUT THAT IT WON'T.

88
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:41,881
WITH THAT THINKING, WHY HAVE

89
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,248
DIPLOMACY?

90
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:46,052
WHAT SHOULD REASSURE YOU?

91
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:48,054
POMPEO, BOLTON, TRUMP.

92
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:50,423
THIS ISN'T JOHN KERRY, HILLARY,

93
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:52,025
OR BEN RHODES, ENTITLED LEMMINGS

94
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:52,692
OUT FOR LEGACY.

95
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,894
THEY WERE ALL CARRIED.

96
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:55,995
THE NEW GUYS MOSTLY STICK WHICH

97
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:59,232
MAKES THE CARE POSSIBLE.

98
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:00,700
THE ESTABLISHMENT WILL LAST.

99
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,435
THE SAME PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT

100
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,836
TRUMP WAS LEADING US TO WAR ARE

101
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:05,838
MAD THAT HE IS AVERTING IT.

102
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:06,773
AS FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD READ THE

103
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:10,043
NEWS WITH HOPE.

104
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:11,644
LET'S CHECK BACK IN A YEAR.

105
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:13,579
WORST CASE WE ARE BACK AT SQUARE

106
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,681
ONE.

107
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,382
THAT'S NO CONFESSION, JUST A

108
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:16,849
PATH TRIED.

109
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:19,252
WHAT DID ONE GREAT PHILOSOPHER

110
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:20,053
SAY?

111
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,654
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE

112
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:22,422
WHAT HAPPENS.

113
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,189
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

114
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:24,223
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

115
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:25,858
WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT

116
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:26,192
HAPPENS.

117
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:27,627
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

118
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,829
>> Greg: WE WILL SEE WHAT

119
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,897
HAPPENS.

120
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:32,632
OKAY, KILMEADE, I'M GOING TO YOU

121
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:33,399
FIRST BECAUSE FRANKLY I FEEL BAD

122
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:37,070
FOR YOU.

123
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,671
HAS ANYBODY EVER DONE THIS

124
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:39,005
BEFORE?

125
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:42,075
PRESENT A VIDEO.

126
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:43,743
IT'S LIKE A TIME-SHARE

127
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:44,544
CONDOMINIUM VIDEO THAT A

128
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:46,879
SALESMAN WILL SHOW YOU TO GET

129
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,448
YOU TO GO ON THE TOUR.

130
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,115
THIS COULD BE THE START OF

131
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,250
SOMETHING NEW.

132
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,452
YOU GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND

133
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:56,155
GO, THIS IS WHAT YOU COULD HAVE.

134
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:57,056
>> Brian: IT'S GREAT.

135
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,991
I COULD NOT BACK YOUR DECISION

136
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:02,061
TO COME TO ME FIRST.

137
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:05,264
I WATCHED IT AND I GOT UP AT

138
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:11,270
1:30 TWO DO THE SHOW AT 5:00.

139
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,972
HE ALSO SAID THIS ON THE CONDO

140
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:14,007
EPISODE.

141
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,075
HE SAID WATCHING THE VESSELS,

142
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:16,843
THE ROCKETS TAKE OFF WHEN THEY

143
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:17,777
HIT JAPAN.

144
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:18,978
I AM THINKING TO MYSELF IT'S A

145
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:19,478
BEAUTIFUL BEACH.

146
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,584
WE COULD PUT CONDOS.

147
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,852
I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS

148
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:27,887
TO SAY IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK

149
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:30,289
BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS KEEP YOUR

150
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,257
POWDER DRY IF YOU ARE QUICK TO

151
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:34,360
CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

152
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,797
THIS IS JUST STEP NUMBER ONE OF

153
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,399
A BRAND-NEW SERIES OF STAIRS.

154
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,500
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THIS

155
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,534
IS HEADING, BUT I KNOW FOR SURE

156
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,870
IT'S NOT DONE YET.

157
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,338
THE PRESSURE IS REALLY ON THEM

158
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,440
BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST CHANCE

159
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,775
THEY WILL EVER HAVE GIVE THEIR

160
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:53,246
PEOPLE A FUTURE AND GIVE THEIR

161
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:55,314
MONARCHY, WHATEVER YOU CALL IT,

162
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:57,250
SOME TYPE OF SECURITY.

163
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,584
IF THEY WANT AN EXAMPLE.

164
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:01,454
IT IS VIETNAM AND CHINA.

165
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:02,288
ECONOMIES WHERE WE NEVER WANT TO

166
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,258
LIVE BUT THEY ARE FOUND WAYS TO

167
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:07,093
PUT MARKET PRINCIPLES IN THERE.

168
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,494
VIETNAM PROBABLY GETS ALONG

169
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:10,063
BETTER WITH US THAN CHINA AND

170
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:10,863
RUSSIA THESE DAYS.

171
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:13,266
I AM ENCOURAGED BY THE CHANCE.

172
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,068
PLENTY OF REASONS TO POKE HOLES

173
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:15,368
IN IT.

174
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,503
THIS TERM, WHICH I THINK IS NOT

175
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:22,708
GREAT, COMPETES TO WORK --

176
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,111
COMMITS TO WORK TOWARDS

177
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:27,313
DENUCLEARIZATION.

178
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:28,881
IT'S A FIRST STEP.

179
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:31,084
NEXT WEEK BOLTON AND POMPEO PICK

180
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:32,485
UP WHERE THIS SUMMIT LEFT OFF.

181
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,353
GAME ON.

182
00:05:34,353 --> 00:05:36,489
>> Greg: WHAT DO YOU THINK,

183
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:37,423
DANA?

184
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:40,660
I AM SKEPTICAL BUT I ALSO HAVE A

185
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,594
FEELING OF HOPE.

186
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:42,695
>> Dana: I THINK THAT'S TRUE.

187
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:46,432
I KIND OF FEEL THE SAME AS I DID

188
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,266
YESTERDAY.

189
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,469
I HAD SOME UNEASINESS LOOKING AT

190
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,070
THE FLAGS SIDE-BY-SIDE.

191
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,271
NO HE'S AN EQUAL PARTNER.

192
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,273
KIM REALLY DID GET A LOT OF OUT

193
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:54,674
OF THIS.

194
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:55,908
ALL THE PROPAGANDA HE CAN USE

195
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:56,876
BACK HOME.

196
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,511
NOW RUSSIA HAS TO COME TO HIM TO

197
00:05:58,511 --> 00:05:59,479
HAVE A MEETING.

198
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,114
THE CHINESE ARE GOING TO COME TO

199
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,315
HIM TO HAVE A MEETING.

200
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:04,517
HE NO LONGER HAS TO GO THERE.

201
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:06,419
THE VIDEO DOES REMIND ME OF THE

202
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,154
IDEA I HAD A LONG TIME AGO THAT

203
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:13,459
I ASKED GENERAL PETRAEUS ABOUT.

204
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,861
CREATE A VIDEO SHOWING THE

205
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:17,530
SUICIDE BOMBERS, WHAT COULD

206
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,400
HAPPEN AND HOW RISKY IT COULD BE

207
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,068
HAPPEN AND HOW RISKY IT COULD B

208
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:23,069
BE.

209
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,138
>> Greg: PRESENT THE

210
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:30,243
ALTERNATIVE.

211
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:34,180
>> Dana: I HAD A WOMAN ON

212
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,781
TODAY, A FORMER CIA DEPUTY

213
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:36,816
DIRECTOR FOR KOREAN ISSUES.

214
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:40,486
SHE SAID OVERALL NET PLUS.

215
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:43,089
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE I

216
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:43,689
WAS YESTERDAY.

217
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,258
HOPEFUL BUT SKEPTICAL.

218
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:46,993
I THINK THAT PERSONNEL IS POLICY

219
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:48,694
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

220
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:51,264
THE FACT THAT BOLTON AND POMPEO

221
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:53,566
ARE GOING ON THERE IS GOOD.

222
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:56,169
I WONDER, THE PEOPLE CRITICAL OF

223
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,872
IT, MANY ON THE LEFT, PEOPLE ARE

224
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:00,907
CRITICAL OF IT BECAUSE THEY'RE

225
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,308
LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING IT'S

226
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:03,075
NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

227
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:05,811
THEY WERE THE SAME ONES WHO

228
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:06,579
PRAISED PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR

229
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:06,879
IRAN.

230
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:14,687
I THINK THE SKIP      SKEPTICISM

231
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:14,720
I THINK THE SKIP      SKEPTICISI

232
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,722
I THINK THE SKIP      SKEPTICISS

233
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:17,657
WARRANTED.

234
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:18,691
>> Greg: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

235
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:20,259
GOING TO BE ON HANNITY TONIGHT.

236
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,962
THEY ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

237
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:23,863
EARLY RHETORIC DONALD TRUMP

238
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:24,230
EMPLOYED.

239
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,866
LET'S ROLL THAT TAPE.

240
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:30,636
>> I THINK WITHOUT THE RHETORIC,

241
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,470
WE DID SANCTIONS AND ALL THE

242
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,873
THINGS YOU WOULD DO BUT I THINK

243
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:35,341
WITHOUT THE RHETORIC, OTHER

244
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,542
ADMINISTRATIONS, I DON'T WANT TO

245
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:38,911
GET SPECIFIC ON THAT BUT THEY

246
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:41,714
HAD UP POLICY OF SALADS.

247
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:42,515
IF THEY SAID SOMETHING VERY BAD

248
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,684
VERY THREATENING AND HORRIBLE,

249
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:46,385
JUST DON'T ANSWER.

250
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:49,488
THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER.

251
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:51,791
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

252
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,459
THE RHETORIC, I HATED TO DO IT.

253
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,393
SOMETIMES I FELT FOOLISH DOING

254
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,963
IT BUT WE HAD NO CHOICE.

255
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,899
>> Greg: WHAT DO YOU THINK,

256
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:00,199
JUAN?

257
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,467
>> Juan: HE IS CELEBRATING

258
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,102
HIMSELF, RATIONALIZING WHAT HE

259
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:03,803
DID BEFORE.

260
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:05,271
>> Greg: HE JUST SAID HE MIGHT

261
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,239
HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.

262
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,407
>> Juan: NO, HE DIDN'T.

263
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:10,076
>> Greg: HE SAID HE MIGHT'VE

264
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:10,810
FELT BAD DOING IT.

265
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,211
>> Juan: HE SAID IT WORKED.

266
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:13,312
TO ME, THIS WHOLE THING COME I

267
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:15,181
LISTENED TO YOU AND I THINK LOOK

268
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:18,484
AT THE DEFENDERS OF TRUMP TODAY.

269
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,886
THIS IS LIKE A WET FIRECRACKER.

270
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:23,856
THIS IS LIKE THE END OF

271
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,491
"THE SOPRANOS" WHERE YOU GO,

272
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,459
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TV?

273
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,462
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

274
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:32,265
>> Greg: THAT WAS A GREAT

275
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:32,664
SERIES.

276
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,833
>> Brian: DON'T STOP BELIEVING

277
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,635
ON THE JUKEBOX.

278
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,270
>> Juan: THE MAN WHO SET THE

279
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,105
BAR FOR THIS WAS NONE OTHER THAN

280
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:42,275
OUR TV STAR, DONALD TRUMP.

281
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,174
DONALD TRUMP SAID NO LENGTHY

282
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,777
NEGOTIATIONS LIKE MY

283
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:45,211
PREDECESSORS.

284
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:47,780
HE SAID NO CONCESSIONS THAT WILL

285
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,849
STALL AND SIMPLY GIVE THIS

286
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,884
HORRIBLE REGIME MORE TIME TO

287
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:53,653
PERPETRATE THEIR TERROR.

288
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:54,353
HE SAID QUITE CLEARLY WE ARE

289
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:57,456
GOING TO TALK ABOUT HUMAN

290
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,592
RIGHTS, OTTO WARMBIER.

291
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:00,293
TODAY HE SAYS OTTO WARMBIER

292
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:01,093
DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN.

293
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,996
BUT YOU DIDN'T BRING IT UP.

294
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:04,597
>> Greg: YES, HE DID.

295
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:08,067
IT WAS AMAZING.

296
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,669
REPATRIATION AS WELL.

297
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:10,202
BE ACCURATE.

298
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:12,605
>> Juan: I WILL BE ACCURATE.

299
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,806
HERE'S WHAT KIM SAID, WE AGREED

300
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:15,875
TO LET THE PAST BE THE PAST.

301
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,709
WE ARE MOVING ON.

302
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:20,079
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

303
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:20,746
LET ME FINISH.

304
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:23,616
HERE YOU HAVE A SITUATION, YOU

305
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:26,552
SAY, ARE THESE LEMMINGS?

306
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:28,587
JOHN KERRY AND OTHERS ARE

307
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:29,989
LEMMINGS.

308
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,691
IS OTTO WARMBIER ONE OF THE

309
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:32,091
LEMMINGS?

310
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:34,860
DID HE JUST GO AWAY, GO OFF THE

311
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,861
EDGE?

312
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:36,595
>> Greg: THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

313
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,898
I DID NOT SAY THAT.

314
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:41,734
THAT WAS SO WRONG, JUAN.

315
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:46,939
I DID NOT CALL WARMBEIR A

316
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:51,577
LEMMING, YOU MORON.

317
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:53,079
>> Juan: I GUESS YOU NEVER

318
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:55,581
READ ABOUT BILL CLINTON AND THE

319
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:56,982
FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE

320
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:57,717
NORTH KOREANS TOOK CONCESSIONS,

321
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:58,484
DON'T DELIVER.

322
00:09:58,484 --> 00:09:59,852
HOW ABOUT THE SIX PARTY TALKS.

323
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:02,655
>> Greg: I STOPPED LISTENING

324
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:07,093
TO YOU WHEN YOU SAID I CALLED --

325
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:10,796
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

326
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:12,498
YOU ACCUSED ME OF SAYING

327
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:13,899
SOMETHING I DIDN'T SAY.

328
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,600
>> Juan: SAYING THAT THESE

329
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,269
GUYS ARE LEMMINGS.

330
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,271
>> Brian: THEY DID BRING UP

331
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:19,872
HUMAN RIGHTS.

332
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:20,272
KIMBERLY.

333
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:21,540
>> Kimberly: THANK YOU.

334
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,676
WHAT ARE WE, NORTH KOREA RIGHT

335
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:23,943
NOW?

336
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,311
I HAVE AN OPINION TOO.

337
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:26,912
I THINK IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO

338
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:27,513
WATCH LAST NIGHT.

339
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:32,017
SO MANY OF US WERE RIVETED, IT'S

340
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:32,585
AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN

341
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:33,252
INTERNATIONAL DISCOURSE AND

342
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:33,619
DIPLOMACY.

343
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,821
I REALLY HOPE AND PRAY THAT THIS

344
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:37,556
IS THE FIRST STEP OF MANY

345
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,258
MEETINGS BETWEEN THE

346
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:41,927
UNITED STATES AND NORTH,

347
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:44,296
SOUTH KOREA, CHINA, TO BE ABLE

348
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:45,331
TO WORK TOGETHER.

349
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,999
NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS INVOLVED, TO

350
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:48,968
BE ABLE TO TRUST BUT VERIFY

351
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:50,703
WHICH IS REAGAN'S POLICY, AND

352
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,071
REALLY WORK TOWARDS PEACE.

353
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:54,073
NO ONE BENEFITS FOR MORE.

354
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:56,275
IN THAT SENSE, I THINK THIS WAS

355
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:57,676
SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPORTANT, A

356
00:10:57,676 --> 00:10:59,812
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

357
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:00,479
CAN YOU SAY HE TRUSTS THE

358
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,648
ACTIONS OF THAT MAN THAT HAS RUN

359
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:14,160
A BRUTAL REGIME OF TORTURE AND

360
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,894
BEHAVES HORRIFICALLY TO HIS OWN

361
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:15,227
PEOPLE?

362
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:15,961
PERHAPS WE HAVE A SMALL PARK TO

363
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:16,695
PLAY IN STOPPING THAT, SHEDDING

364
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:17,296
SOME LIGHT ON IT AND NOT

365
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:17,897
CONTINUING TO HAVE THEM

366
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:18,264
ISOLATED.

367
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:18,931
TO CREATE AND COMMIT THEIR

368
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,099
HORRORS WITHOUT THE REST OF THE

369
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,267
WORLD KNOWING ABOUT IT.

370
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:24,603
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE

371
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:25,604
IN VAIN.

372
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:26,405
THAT REALLY DID CAST A VERY

373
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:28,641
BRIGHT LIGHT ON WHAT WAS GOING

374
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,576
ON IN NORTH KOREA.

375
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:33,579
I THINK SO PIVOTAL IN TERMS OF

376
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,916
BEING ABLE TO GET POWs, M.I.A.

377
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,451
REMAINS HOME, TO BE ABLE TO

378
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:40,085
NEGOTIATE FOR THE OTHER HOSTAGES

379
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:40,686
THAT WERE HELD THERE.

380
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,655
THAT DOES MATTER TO THOSE

381
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:43,789
FAMILIES AND THOSE THAT HAVE

382
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:44,490
BEEN GRIEVING AND LOOKING TO

383
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,592
BURY THEIR LOVED ONES.

384
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,094
I SAY LET'S GIVE THIS A CHANCE.

385
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:50,596
KUDOS TO OUR PRESIDENT FOR BEING

386
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:52,665
ABLE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN WHICH

387
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:53,365
SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK --

388
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:55,134
>> Juan: WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF

389
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:55,868
THIS?

390
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:58,504
WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO STOP OUR

391
00:11:58,504 --> 00:11:59,305
EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA.

392
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:03,943
WHAT DO WE GET IN RETURN?

393
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:04,577
WE GET PROMISES, PLEDGES.

394
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:07,079
OH, MY GOSH.

395
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,881
>> Greg: YOU ARE SUCH A BABY,

396
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:12,518
JUAN, ABOUT THIS.

397
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,119
>> Juan: WE GOT COMPLETE

398
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:14,620
DENUCLEARIZATION?

399
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,321
>> Kimberly: WE GOT A PROMISE

400
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:17,456
TO WORK TOWARDS IT.

401
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,592
IT'S BETTER THAN NOT DOING IT.

402
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:21,727
>> Juan: YOUR PEOPLE WHO SAY

403
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,729
THE IRAN DEAL STINKS, RIGHT?

404
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,499
THE IRAN DEAL, THE IRANIANS

405
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,399
DIDN'T HAVE NUKES.

406
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,134
WE HAD A DEAL TO STOP THEM FROM

407
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:30,069
GETTING THEM.

408
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,203
>> Greg: NOW THEY ARE QUICKLY

409
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:32,238
GETTING THEM.

410
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:33,072
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

411
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:33,939
>> Juan: THE NORTH KOREANS

412
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:36,675
HAVE NUKES.

413
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:37,510
GIVEN WE ARE SAYING THIS IS

414
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,679
ABOUT NONPROLIFERATION.

415
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,248
>> Greg: USING YOUR OLD,

416
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:45,684
TRADITIONAL, BAD DIPLOMACY.

417
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:49,121
>> Juan: LET ME SAY WE ARE

418
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,089
REWARDING --

419
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,891
[ALL SPEAKING]

420
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,359
GETTING NOTHING FOR IT.

421
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,026
>> Brian: I CANNOT BELIEVE

422
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:57,296
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE DONALD TRUMP

423
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:58,264
REWARDED BAD BEHAVIOR.

424
00:12:58,264 --> 00:12:59,698
>> Juan: HE DID.

425
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:00,232
>> Brian: WHAT DID

426
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:03,869
BILL CLINTON DO?

427
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:05,170
HE MET WITH HIM AND IS STARTING

428
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,507
A SERIES OF TALKS.

429
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:10,109
>> Juan: WHY DO YOU THINK

430
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,477
OTHER PRESIDENTS DIDN'T DO IT?

431
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,445
>> Brian: THERE'S A REASON.

432
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:14,246
THEY DIDN'T HAVE NUCLEAR

433
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:16,315
WEAPONS, THEY WEREN'T A THREAT.
