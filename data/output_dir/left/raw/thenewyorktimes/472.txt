It was normal life.

00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,230
I have everything there.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,940
I had my own house.

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,560
I had a car.

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,580
I had money.

7
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,140
I had everything in Aleppo,
but I didn't feel my freedom.

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,870
But after the war,
I lost everything,

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,785
but I had my freedom.

I'm Dr. Farida I'm from Aleppo.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,290
I was working in M2 hospital.

19
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,810
I was the OB-GYN there.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,670
It was my dream to be a doctor.

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,440
In Aleppo and in Idlib also,
it's very necessary to be

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,870
an OB-GYN, because there
is not many OB-GYN in Syria

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,620
and in Aleppo.

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,863

00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:19,980
Hi.

29
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,610
This is our dinner from
the besieged Aleppo.

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,040
We have some macaroni with
garlic and some yogurt.

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,670
Nothing else.

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:35,697


33
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:38,990
Hospitals are
always is a target,

34
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,095
because they have airplanes
always targeting all hospitals

35
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:44,300
in Aleppo.

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,330
When we evacuated from Aleppo,
there was just one hospital was

37
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,620
working.

38
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,770
And before the war it was
10, about 10 hospitals.

39
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,310
But he started to
target them one by one.

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,020
You are stuck, and you
can't go out of this area.

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,070
And they always bombing us.

42
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,950
They always killing us with
every weapon that you can

43
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,350
imagine in the world.

44
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,690
So our last weeks in Aleppo
was like a horror movie,

45
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,123
and it was in reality,
not just a movie.

I can dress what I want.

49
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,030
I can go where I want.

50
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,750
But in the regime areas,
in the regime held areas,

51
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,430
you can't do what you want.

52
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,890
You can't talk what you
want at the hospital.

53
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,900
When the regime know
that you are work--

54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,500
that you were working at that
hospital, they will arrest you.

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,260
Because it's-- they'll consider
you as a terrorist if you are

56
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,700
working there.

57
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,330
Good morning, [INAUDIBLE],
Ranking member Cardin,

58
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,970
distinguished member
of the committee.

59
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,300
Thank you for the opportunity
to appear before you today.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,990
It's our duty as a human being
to advocate all of the involved

61
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,070
parties on the ground to
allow him humanitarian access,

62
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,070
and to finally hold these
who violate international

63
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,680
humanitarian law accountable.

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,178
Later this month, my family
and I will return to Syria

65
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:33,082
to continue our work at the
hospital in Northern Syria.

66
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,513
The reason is simple.

67
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,490
It's our duty--

68
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:36,990


69
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,690
I want the world to know
what's happened in Syria,

70
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,040
and what's still happening.

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,170
Now it's happening in
[INAUDIBLE] in, Homs,

72
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,100
in Al-Huta, and other
places, and in other places.

73
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,280
It not just happened in Aleppo.

74
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,060
Now it's happening once again.

75
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,280
And for chemical
attacks, we talked many,

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,310
many times about
chemical attacks.

77
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,550
And you know they have to
charge Assad regime with this,

78
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,200
but no one is talking.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,160
And now he's targeting us with
chemical attack once again.

80
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,880
I have to be there to do my
work and to teach these doctors.

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,430
It's very important,
so we need to go back.

82
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,360
And it's my country also.

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,070
I miss my country.
