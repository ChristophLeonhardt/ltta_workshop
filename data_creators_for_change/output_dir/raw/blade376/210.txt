00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,850
at the blood place you weren't allowed

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,230
to see record anything didn't say why

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they did this at privacy is that</font>

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,859
what they said I didn't hear him say

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think I was swearing out a wall</font>

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,940
while they products playing that bit so

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,830
yeah it was unfortunate but I've got

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,979
proof he did it say that's proof

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,900
although you can get these pre chief

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,060

do it I didn't I chicken they'll know I

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,119

America recently yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do it in 10</font>

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,259

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,180
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to donating blood there are a</font>

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,270
lot of concerns people tend to have 41

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,650
there are a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who find</font>

35
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,720
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of seeing blood you don't</font>

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,360
actually need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it you can look</font>

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,579
away like I did yeah the needle it it

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,100
hurts when it first goes in like quickly

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,930
but you can actually get local

40
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,990
anesthetic they do offer that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

41
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,200
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing they said I had a good</font>

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,450
vein but I don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means I</font>

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,659
should I i I'd said that but without and

44
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,149
they said oh it means you have a very

45
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,460
exposed rain and I said thank you well

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,960
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they do is they give you</font>

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,729
a checklist of loads of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

48
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,068
need to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't done like</font>

49
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,100
and

50
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,210
sex with people who have diseases so

51
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they actually give you a pint</font>

52
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,320
of water or juice to drink first to get

53
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,960
fluids in you they take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> blood test on</font>

54
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,940
your finger and they just give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

55
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,230
little prick they ask you questions

56
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,750
confirm everything and then they do an

57
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,380
iodine test I think or they do a test

58
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,740
test to do with iron iron yeah and if

59
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,420
it's all good you're then ready to go

60
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,480
you lie on a bed a nurse comes along

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,370
this is blood testing by the way not

62
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,040
some fantasy I have all those so far

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,500
it's quite similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they get</font>

64
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,510
some bondage and they strap your arm and

65
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,010
they tend to it they actually find out

66
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,890
which arm they prefer both<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when were</font>

67
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,570
all right but they gave me my right arm

68
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,880
and then they say right you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

69
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,660
feel a prick and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes about 10</font>

70
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes the process they do it is just</font>

71
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really well done they keep you</font>

72
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,510
comfortable on in afterwards they give

73
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,090
you all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can have</font>

74
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,790
biscuits and drinks I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do</font>

75
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,350
that I was standing up talking to

76
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,390
