1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,080
A group of gang members armed
with machetes and knives.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,640
A teenager hunted down

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,990
and dragged from a
New York City bodega.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,140
Then swarmed
by attackers outside.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,120
The vicious murder
in June of

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,870
Lesandro Guzman-Feliz

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,780
just blocks from
his Bronx home

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,540
drew outrage from across
the city and beyond.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,060
The incident revealed the
barbaric tactics of a gang

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,720
called the Trinitarios and
it laid bare a glaring paradox:

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,470
Amid historically low
crime rates in New York,

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,200
police are still struggling
to contain brutal violence

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,240
in some neighborhoods.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,840
The footage went viral

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,890
and with rumor and
speculation about why

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,260
the 15-year-old boy known
as Junior was singled out.

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,750
We obtained footage from
multiple security cameras

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,950
and cell phones.

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,410
We talked to police sources,

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,580
family members and
other witnesses.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,580
Our investigation
retraces Jrunior’s last steps

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,042
and uncovers new details that may
answer why he was targeted.

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,680
It’s Wednesday, June 20th.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,110
Junior is on summer
break from school.

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,650
He’s at home with
his mother.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,510
At 10:05 p.m., security footage
shows Junior leaving home

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,050
to meet his friend Jason
Velez at this corner.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,840
They hang out on a stoop close
by, chatting and listening

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,610
to hip-hop, according to Jason.

30
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,550
At around 11:30, Junior leaves,

31
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,890
and two minutes later
security cameras

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,280
catch him on this corner
passing near his home.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,430
He was walking toward
Adams Place, a small street

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,900
about five minutes away

35
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,600
that’s known for
gang activity.

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,980
Friends and family told us
that Junior wasn’t in a gang

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,620
and the police have no
such indication either.

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,982
But some of his friends were,
and he had been

39
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:07,070
hanging out with them
at Adams Place recently.

40
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,980
On his way there,

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,750
Junior was in touch
with this friend,

42
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,380
who lives on Adams place and who,
according to our reporting,

43
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,570
is not in a gang either.

44
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,970
The friend says he told
Junior not to come over

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,440
because it was late.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,350
At 11:35, a security camera films
four cars driving slowly

47
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,110
past the stoop where Junior’s
friend and some others

48
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,600
were sitting.

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,300
The friend says they felt
things were getting dicey

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,290
and went inside.

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,470
The cars briefly stop
at this intersection,

52
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,380
and then turn left in the
direction of Junior’s path.

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,700
According to police, the drivers
spot Junior and taunt him.

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,290
Junior begins to run
and the cars give chase.

55
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,190
The cars then split up
and appear to surround him.

56
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,220
It’s 11:37.

57
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,750
Junior rushes into this bodega
just one block from his home.

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,190
In a panic, he tries to hide
behind the counter.

59
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,300
But it’s too late.

60
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,270
One man, identified
by prosecutors

61
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,470
as Jose Tavarez, enters the
bodega and spots Junior.

62
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,100
He’s been charged
with these crimes.

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,790
He leaves and immediately
three other men enter.

64
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,890
Police have identified them
as: Danel Fernandez,

65
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,270
Kevin Alvarez,

66
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,300
and Michael Sosa Reyes, who has not
been charged

67
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,070
in relation to Junior’s killing.

68
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,880
Parked outside the bodega are
the cars that chased Junior.

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,180
At least eight other
men are on the lookout.

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,620
Some armed with
knives.

71
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,990
A warning: These next scenes
are hard to watch,

72
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,640
and we’ve obscured
some graphic parts.

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,290
Junior and the bodega
owner appear

74
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,030
to have an exchange
with Kevin Alvarez

75
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,170
before Junior was grabbed
and beaten on the ground.

76
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,080
Then he’s dragged
from the bodega

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,110
and brutally stabbed by
a swarm of attackers.

78
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,230
According to prosecutors,
Jose Munoz first hacks

79
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,405
Junior with a machete.

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,610
Then, Elvin Garcia,
who police say

81
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,075
is seen here wearing a mask.

82
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,410
Manuel Rivera is accused
of repeatedly stabbing Junior.

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,080
Antonio Santiago is seen here

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,270
from this other angle.

85
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,220
Prosecutors say that
Jonaiki Martinez

86
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,950
gave the fatal stab,
slashing Junior’s neck.

87
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,460
Five other people have
been arrested and accused

88
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,680
of involvement in the crime.

89
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,820
All of the men charged
have pleaded not guilty.

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,290
It’s 11:39.

91
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,320
Junior stumbles back into
the bodega,

92
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,330
leaving a trail of blood on the floor.

93
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,710
But the owner appears
to direct him away.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,610
Junior gestures for
someone to call 911.

95
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,970
Then he starts running to St.
Barnabas Hospital, just one

96
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,980
block away.

97
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,780
He makes it to the
entrance of the hospital

98
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,566
before collapsing.

99
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,980
Passersby try to help.

100
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,050
Witnesses say these
two police officers

101
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,210
stood by watching the scene.

102
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,454
They are under investigation
for failing to help.

103
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,210
Just 20 minutes
later, Junior is

104
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,480
pronounced dead as a result of
a stab wound to the neck.

105
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,960
How Junior was killed

106
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,430
follows a pattern
of attacks by

107
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,740
Trinitarios, a
Dominican gang that

108
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,650
was born in New York
prisons.

109
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,800
In recent months,

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,290
turf wars have spiked among
rival Trinitario factions.

111
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,950
At least 10 other people
have been maimed this summer

112
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,140
in tit-for-tat
attacks in the Bronx.

113
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,260
Just two days before Junior
was killed, a 14-year-old

114
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,490
was seriously injured
in this attack.

115
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,790
And on the night
before Junior’s murder,

116
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,610
he had witnessed another
stabbing at Adams Place.

117
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,920
Junior’s friend,
a Trinitario, had

118
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,800
been attacked by a rival
faction and allegedly

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,170
turned to Junior for help.

120
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,690
Is that why Junior
was targeted?

121
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,010
We don’t know.

122
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,860
But a leading police theory
is the attackers mistakenly

123
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,950
believed Junior was
in a rival gang.

124
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,280
What we do know is that for
Junior — like many teenagers

125
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,410
growing up in gang-afflicted areas —

126
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,290
there’s a fine line between
hanging out on the streets

127
00:06:56,290 --> 00:00:00,000
and getting caught up
in deadly violence.
