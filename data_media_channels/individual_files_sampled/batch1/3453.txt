I think an epidemic either naturally caused or intentionally caused is the most likely thing to cause say 10 million excess deaths and that it's pretty surprising how little preparedness there is for it now it's tricky because this is a global problem so you know how two countries work together which countries should put up what resources and you know every aspect of it the the resources to go engage in the affected countries the allocation decisions as we've seen various blue scares come along we haven't had a super good response so the peridot Matic examples are smallpox for an intentionally cause thing that there was a simulation called dark winter that didn't come out very well ie smallpox scored one and humanity scored zero blue epidemics where you know we always talk about the potential recurrence of a 19:17 like Spanish flu problem and then Ebola which although it was much smaller there was some luck involved in that because it wasn't spread through respiratory contact the reproductive rate was a lot lower and you know as basically people who were sick or dead who are doing most of the transmission and so through a lot of heroic efforts and a little bit of luck it stayed under control and was largely contained to the three countries but wouldn't that necessarily would have been the case in fact you know global health community was a bit surprised because that particular pathogen have been seen in rural settings and so it never gotten to large numbers the fact that it could get into an urban setting and then that the reproduction rate would be pretty substantial that came as a negative surprise so bill you're excited about the technology innovation that's going on this to the RNAi area do you talk us through where we're at how optimistic you are that we can really accelerate the process of getting a vaccine developed once once one of these potential pandemics is being identified well there's no license product using these technologies so they're still in terms of immunogenicity duration some questions be answered you know there's early animal data that shows real promise and there's a lot of entities government entities are foundation others who've been working with the pharma companies and new entrants like Mederma and cure back and saying okay what types of diseases would this work for so the platform comes along it will be a valuable tool for the ongoing infectious diseases where we still have a gigantic burden it'll be valuable for epidemics and potentially as a tool to to limit the effective of bioterrorism so it's very exciting and yet you know do we get products out in two years five years or does it prove to be more difficult than we expect they're still a range of uncertainty it looks strong enough though that we feel very good about sepi as it is picking some particular pathogens to go after and I think they published the list of the top three that they may fit out to the the private sector favoring responses that are using the new platform since helping prove out the platform would be one of the primary benefits but we'd also if we get right on those three we'd have a stockpile of vaccines that you know that's kind of a day zero well it they don't get there immediately but it it would fall under the you know six-week type scenario and these aren't pathogens that replicate at the same rate that flu does so it would make a huge difference if we guess right but even if we don't the practice of going through that what was the approval you know what other courts look like how generic is the manufacturing if we're trying to get the right immunity just me I think it'll be a very key step in the learning curve and so accepting to step forward people should think this alone you know it's been answered all these unmet needs around epidemics in fact you know there's a lot of other players like the US UK China who are concerned about these things and whether they join septa formally or just are working in parallel you know we're expecting R&D funding from a lot of other people to be complimentary so that ideally five to ten years from now not only vaccines but the other tools as well our speed of response our understanding of who should do what when would be dramatically better than any of our recent challenges even you know SARS or you know some of the real to Mystic that we're going to do that well I think sepia is a step in the right direction you know I think it's too bad in a way that we have had to have these epidemics to get us to move but the timing in terms of the science the recognition that epidemics don't respect borders and so whether you're looking at this through humanitarian lens or a purely domestic lens these are investments that that should be made I think this is a very positive stuff so a good time for two very brief and clear questions from the audience anyone like to to say anything such a thing which always here we are though in the middle of it there'll be a microphone coming to you quick you just say who you are for those who don't know Jeff Drazen from the New England Journal of Medicine so one of the big problems with epidemics is recognizing what it's happening because you don't get a letter in the mail thing it's now happening so and that may be the critical period of time for intervention by the time we recognize we have a problem it may be too late so to what extent do we need to invest in resources to help identify the emergence of something new and I'm not quite sure exactly what those resources would be but it seems to me that the timing of recognition so you can then make the vaccine and deploy is a unknown variable you're absolutely right the and I should have mentioned surveillance as another area where the needs are are quite dramatic there are some steps that have been taken in that direction our foundation is funding the thing called Champs which is a series of surveillance sites in developing countries but that doesn't really cover what needs to be done for surveillance there also you have to be careful because the political incentive to declare that you have an epidemic is often works against us that you want to either hope that it's not or you know avoid the disruption to trade and commerce that it causes and so in Ebola that was another thing that didn't work as well as we would have liked it to certainly diagnostic technology is coming along and that will be an aid in doing this and for example just take polio which is a case I know better than other diseases it's amazing how our understanding of that virus spread is today is 90% through sewage surveillance not through cases because cases there's so much time between somebody actually getting the virus getting paralyzed getting discovered that the virus that one in particular because it has so many asymptomatic cases it could have traveled halfway around the globe by the time you look at those cases but the environmental surveillance ie sewage sampling gives us not only the detection but the genetics so we can understand exactly as of today where in Pakistan and Afghanistan it's moving around and therefore where we need to intervene so you know there will have to be surveillance investments to make sure that's not the the missing piece it's a very good point I'm gonna Brown this color because it might coming to here so the panel has talked about Ebola as a opportunity to learn lessons but we've had another unexpected appearance of a virus on the scene that's caused a lot of worldwide pain in particularly in this case birth defects Zika so I'm curious what lessons you see we've learned from that one that could apply to this larger view of where we need to go next well I think Ebola in some ways presented in a more classic way with unique symptoms you know Zika is still recent enough that the understanding of okay should we have seen it sooner even understanding what the steady-state case looks like in terms of the new genesee wide showed up and in South America and didn't show up in Africa I know people are hard at work trying to answer these questions so the lessons from that one I'm not trying to minimize that one at all but I think they're less clear than them from a bola lessons for vaccine development well there's some good you may be more up-to-date than I am I I think actually the view is that some of these candidate vaccines actually looks fairly promising what they do sometimes we have a hard time picking which of the constructs to go to what stage of trial and designing a trial you know there's still people can disagree about whether the Ebola but the Ebola trial design should amend I don't know in the Zika case if there is a consensus about what a phase three would need to look like DNA vaccine looks pretty good but set absolutely so I'm you know feel at the end of the episode into question it's an evolutionary certainty that we will have these types of epidemics exactly which one and when we don't know what I'm interested in in a sense we're preaching to the converted in this room what do we need to do to get real political leadership when I say real but I know you've talked about it you know there's a lot of discussions at the g7 and and and and you know g20 but it's not at the level that it has been for other threats and yet this threat is potentially a you know trans global you know of you know could kill 50 million people 100 million people so what is it going to take is it fear which of course has its own problem is it you know how do we get that consortium of adequate finance over a sustained period of time to do all we need to do to improve the surveillance and make sure these things are funded going forward I think we all want to see that happen it's hard because budgets are very tight global cooperation is very tricky the uncertainties involved are so incredible you know I don't think anybody kind of find that much of a number to it the fact that you know we don't yet have universal flu vaccine you know sort of shows the level of underinvestment and and you know I think it'd be a good sign if if we achieve the universal flu vaccine that would show a step in the right direction because the burden even the ongoing chronic burden of that is emerging is a very significant health cost particularly for pregnant women you know so giving the TED talk writing articles you know we need to stand on our head would what is it it's tough and nobody wants to be the bearer of bad news you know and just going around saying at every speech you give oh this awful thing is going to happen because we also need to talk about the incredible success in global health of you know gobby and Global Fund and primary health care investments so we need a very positive good message to go with this but you know I'll bet if we took a book here we allocate substantial resources for epidemics and then you know how do we get out to a broader set of people and I'm going to the Munich Security Conference partly so that people you know I think bioterrorism is the scary thing but potentially if people understand that the investments against bioterrorism against natural epidemics and to improve our situation on the diseases out there that you can get sort of a triple benefit and not just vaccines Diagnostics antibodies they have to virals I I think there's a role for all those things even you know antibody factory a B type things because of the low latency involved I think has particular promise so it's epi and that's one thing we're I think trying to do a good job in this announcement saying that sepia is a great step but if people think okay put a checkmark next to you know epidemic preparedness that's that's overstating what what what the focus is and you're optimistic about the new administration understanding how huge this problem can be I think we should all engage in all the new members that administration because I think there's a lot that's up in the air more than is typical
