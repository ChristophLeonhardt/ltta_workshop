00:00:00,374 --> 00:00:02,476
GOODED TO SEE YOU.

00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:03,577
DR. MARC SIEGEL.

3
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:04,311
>> Arthel: THANK YOU.

4
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:07,615
ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY, WE WANT

5
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:09,483
TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR SERVICE

6
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:11,052
MEMBERS WHO RUMBLE AROUND THE

7
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,154
BATTLEFIELD IN HEAVILY ARMORED

8
00:00:13,154 --> 00:00:14,689
VEHICLES WHILE THE TRANSPORTS

9
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,658
MAY SAVE THEM FROM AN I.E.D.

10
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:19,560
DETONATION, GETTING OUT OF THE

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,562
MANGLED VEHICLE SAFELY IS A

12
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:23,397
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE.

13
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:25,900
WE LOOK AT HOW THEY PREPARE.

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,168
>> TRYING TO SIMULATE A

15
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:28,936
TRAINING SCENARIO IN CASE YOUR

16
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:31,505
VEHICLE ROLLS, HIT AN I.E.D.,

17
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,174
OR SOME DAMAGE OF THAT SORT.

18
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:34,975
>> IF YOU WERE TO ROLL INTO A

19
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,410
CANAL, GIVE ME REAL WORLD

20
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,378
STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR

21
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:39,146
GUYS THERE AND HOW IT HELPS

22
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:39,647
THERE.

23
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:40,915
>> REAL WORLD, A VEHICLE ROLLS

24
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,851
ON A SERPENTINE AND IT GOES

25
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,620
DOWN, ARMOR ON IT WITH WEIGHT

26
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,254
THROWN AROUND.

27
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:48,689
LANDING ON A WEIRD ANGLE.

28
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,157
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DOORS ARE

29
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:50,791
CRUSHED OR OPEN.

30
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,293
THE MARINES ARE DISORIENTED.

31
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,961
THEY HAVE TO GET OUT OF THERE

32
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:54,895
QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY TALKING

33
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:57,131
ABOUT A BODY OF WATER.

34
00:00:57,131 --> 00:01:00,267
WE DEVELOP THIS SYSTEM TO

35
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,670
TRAIN TO ALLOW US TO ROLL OVER

36
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,572
A VARIETY OF ANGLES.

37
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:07,508
THE OPERATOR OUTSIDE WILL

38
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,075
UNLOCK A DOOR.

39
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:09,643
YOU HAVE TO FIND A DOOR TO GET

40
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:10,010
OUT.

41
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,512
IT WILL INCREASE YOUR COMFORT

42
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:12,713
AND THE FAMILIARITY GETTING

43
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:13,914
OUT OF A VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY

44
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,416
IF YOU'RE DISORIENTED IN THE

45
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:16,250
ROLLOVER SITUATION.

46
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,585
>> THERE IS A BALANCE HERE.

47
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:19,019
THROUGHOUT THE WARS IN IRAQ

48
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:21,222
AND AFGHANISTAN, YOU LEARNED

49
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:22,490
THAT HUMVEES WERE MORE

50
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,358
VULNERABLE TO I.E.D. AND

51
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:24,725
AMBUSHES.

52
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:28,729
YOU ADD ARMOR AND YOU HAVE A

53
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,030
RISK OF THE ROLLOVERS THAT GO

54
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,931
UP.

55
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,801
>> YOU CAN'T NEGATE CASUALTIES

56
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,301
OR INCIDENT.

57
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:35,469
YOU HAVE TO MITIGATE.

58
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:36,904
I'D RATHER HAVE A ROLLOVER

59
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:38,472
VEHICLE WITH LOWER RISK OF

60
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:39,473
INJURY AND PERSONNEL WHERE

61
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:42,676
THEY ARE STILL ALIVE IN

62
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,578
ARMORED SITUATION THAN LIGHTLY

63
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:46,080
OR UNARMORRED VEHICLE WHERE I

64
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,948
DON'T KNOW IF MY PEOPLE ARE

65
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,050
WALKING OUT OF IT.

66
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,287
>> HOW DOES IT APPLY TO A MORE

67
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,588
CONVENTIONAL WAR?

68
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:56,657
>> THE BIG THING IS HYBRID

69
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:57,024
WARFARE.

70
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:58,359
IT USES CROSS OF THE

71
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,761
CONVENTIONAL TACTICS TAN

72
00:02:00,761 --> 00:00:00,000
UNCONVENTIONAL TACTICS.
