â™ª WE USED TO BE BAD LOVE. STEVE: TAYLOR SWIFT BREAKING HER SILENCE OVER POLITICS SIGNALING SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE DEMOCRATS. YESTERDAY ON INSTAGRAM SHE WROTE I HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PUBLICLY VOICE MY POLITICAL OPINIONS I FEEL VERY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT NOW AS MUCH AS I HAVE IN THE PAST AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE VOTING FOR WOMEN IN OFFICE. I CANNOT SUPPORT MARSHA BLACKBURN, SHE IS A REPUBLICAN, HER VOTING RECORD IN CONGRESS APPALS AND TERRIFIES ME. HERE IS CHARLIE KIRK. GOOD MORNING. STEVE: WHY DO YOU THINK TAYLOR SWIFT OUT OF NOWHERE DECIDED TO GET POLITICAL. THIS IS WHAT I USED TO LOVE ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT SHE STAYED AWAY FROM POLITICS. ALL ABOUT MUSIC AND FEMALE EMPOWERMENT. SHE SAYS THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT MARSHA BLACKBURN'S RECORD IN CONGRESS I CAN'T SUPPORT HER. MAYBE SHE SHOULD ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT HER RECORD IN CONGRESS. BEING A CO-SPONSORS OF BILLS THAT STOPPED HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SPONSORS BILLS THAT STOP THE FLOW OF DRUGS AND OPIOIDS NUT STATE OF TENNESSEE AGAINST DOMESTIC ABUSE SO ON AND SO FORTH. RATHER EVIDENT AND CLEAR THAT I DON'T WANT TO ACCUSE HER OF THIS. I DON'T THINK SHE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WROTE THAT POST ON INSTAGRAM. SHE PROBABLY GOT SOME VERY BAD INFORMATION. PART OF THIS NARRATIVE WHERE CELEBRITIES THAT WANT TO DO GOOD IN THE WORLD, I WILL GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF GOOD INTENTIONS ARE BEING TOLD THAT PEOPLE LIKE MARSHA BLACKBURN ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE AND NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER THAN THE TRUTH. THE FINAL THING IS SHE SAID VOTE FOR BREDESEN. IF YOU LOOK AT PRED SON'S RECORD WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR. HUGE ALLEGATIONS OF COVERING UP SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IN HIS ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR. REPORTED BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. STEVE: VERY LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS BURN BURN A AHEAD OF BEFORE THE TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT BY 5 POINTS.

TENNESSEE HAS BECOME A DEEP RED STATE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SO POPULAR IN TENNESSEE, HE JUST DID ANOTHER RALLY THERE WHICH I THINK IS ONLY GOING TO GROW THE MARGIN EVEN FURTHER. THE FINAL THING IS. THIS WOMEN UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ARE DOING BETTER THAN EVER. LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT FOR WOMEN IN 60 YEARS. WAGES ARE GOING UP. BUSINESS START-UPS FOR YOUNG WOMEN RECORD HIGH. TAYLOR SWIFT I LOVE YOUR MUSIC PERSONALLY. COUNCIL YEA WEST I'M A BIGGER FAN OF HIS. I WISH YOU HAD NOT DONE. THIS STAY AWAY FROM POLITICS. STEVE: VERY END OF INSTAGRAM POST SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE THE DEADLINE FOR REGISTERING TO VOTE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S AN EFFORT TO GET OUT THE VOTE. THE BIG QUELL IS OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO VOTE ON AT THE MIDTERMS. WILL ANYBODY BE IMPACTED BY WHAT TAYLOR SWIFT SAYS? THAT WILL BE INTERESTING. SHE HAS AMAZING AMOUNT OF CULTURAL CLOUT. STEVE: 100 PERCENT. I WISH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME FORM OF NEUTRALITY WHERE SHE WENT ABOUT THIS. REGISTER TO VOTE. AND MAKE INFORMED DECISION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPER WAY TO GO AGAINST IT. MARSHA BLACKBURN IS AGAINST LBGT THAT'S RIDICULOUS. ANYONE WHO KNOWS CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN HAS WORKED WITH HER AS I HAVE. KNOW THAT'S SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH. SHE WILL WONDERFUL UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE. PROTECTING THE COUNTRY AND
