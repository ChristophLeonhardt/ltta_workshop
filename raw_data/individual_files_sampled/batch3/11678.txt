us school is under fire after it separated a young transgender student from classmates during an emergency lockdown drill for a gun attack teachers at the Middle School in the state of Virginia couldn't decide whether the pupil should take cover in the boys or girls locker room so was kept away LGBT rights groups say the staff should be charged with emotional abuse during an event that prepares children to survive and attack by actual assailants she was treated as if she was so much of a danger to pierce that she was left exposed and vulnerable while school authorities are now pledging to review all protocols and procedures to make sure all children are treated with dignity and respect in future well how to handle transgender issues is something schools in several countries are grappling with Daniel Hawkins discussed with outspoken radio host John gaunt and veteran LGBT campaigner Peter Tatchell what do you make of the way the teachers handle this incident and separated these students during a drill now if this has not been a drill if it had been a real-life incident of a terrorist attack upon that school I fear that as the teachers debated with the trans people where to place them the backwards and forwards the discussion probably ended up that they would have all been exposed and could have all been potentially killed everybody is shredding on eggshells around this subject so you're probably correct that the school was worried they would get accused of transphobia or whatever they want to call it this week the main thing is in this kind of situation get the kids to a safe place you know this is just the trans people again trying to dominate social policy trying to change the world and to their way of thinking does there have to be segregating to boys and girls that's not necessary just get the kids whatever their gender whatever their sexuality get them to a safe place protect the kids that comes first most important thing is that we understand and accept the right of trans people to live their lives with dignity respect and without living in fear the whole idea of equality is that we all have equality what is happening in the moment with the militant trans around the globe is they're trying to dominate the agenda on every single subject they're trying to make us all whether we like it or not except trans women as if they're real women trans Lobby needs to calm me down a bit the militant wants anger and perhaps even extremism is the cry of downtrodden oppressed suffering people that they lash out because they've suffered so much so I think anyway I agree that the debate really didn't interrupt you I think the debate should be conducted in civil terms gender is about much more than physical bodily appendages it's about genes chromosomes DNA it's also the new evidence about brain structures but some people Peter do not believe that and do not agree with that and some people say this gender nonsense has to stop why not give the person the dignity they deserve treat them with the way that we would want to be respected yeah we we all like I believe that the or radical militant extremist men in dresses need to be stopped and they need to calm down you
