THAT A BAD IDEA?

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,808
>> WE HAVEN'T GIVEN VERY MUCH

75
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:14,343
MONEY TO CENTRAL AMERICA.

76
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:17,012
KEEP IN MIND, WE GIVE ABOUT 1%

77
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,814
OF OUR BUDGET OVERALL IN FOREIGN

78
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:19,381
AID AROUND THE WORLD.

79
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:22,484
A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THAT GOES

80
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:24,553
TO CENTRAL AMERICA.

81
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:27,256
>> Tucker: HOLD ON.

82
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:29,425
WHY DO WE GIVE ANY?

83
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:30,659
ONE-THIRD OF ALL SALVADORANS

84
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,360
LIVE IN OUR COUNTRY A LOT OF

85
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,494
THEM ILLEGALLY AND I'M SURE

86
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:36,432
THEY'RE ALL GREAT PEOPLE, I'M

87

00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:39,501
ISN'T WORKING.

90
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:40,569
THEY ARE OFF-LOADING THEIR POUR

91
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,438
INTO OUR COUNTRY AT A TIME WHEN

92
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,340
WORKING-CLASS JOBS ARE GOING

93
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,741
AWAY DUE TO AUTOMATION, THEIR

94
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:47,076
BENEFIT AND, WE ARE LOSING AND

95
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:49,311
PAYING THEM.

96
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:51,647
>> I JUST EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU.

97
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,248

98
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:54,416
TO HELP IMPROVE THOSE COUNTRIES

99
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,051

100
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,419
THE LONG TERM GOAL.

101
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,788
I THINK YOU AND I BOTH AGREE IT

102
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:00,356
WITH THAT AS DO MANY

103
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:02,491
POLICYMAKERS IN WASHINGTON.

104
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:04,860
WE HAVEN'T DONE A GOOD ENOUGH

106
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:05,794
NEITHER DEMOCRATS NOR

107
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:06,729
REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE A GOOD

108
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,831
ENOUGH JOB OF HELPING THESE

109
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:10,232
COUNTRIES IMPROVE THEIR

110
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:10,866
ECONOMIES, HELPING THESE

111
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:11,600
COUNTRIES IMPROVE THE RULE OF

112
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:14,536
LAW SO PEOPLE DON'T LEAVE.

113
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:18,407
>> Tucker: IS NOT TRUE.

114
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,010
MEXICO HAS JUMPED MORE THAN TEN

115
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:21,844
SPOTS ON THE ECONOMIC

116
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,678
DEVELOPMENT LIST

117
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,145
INTERNATIONALLY.

118
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,813
I THINK IS NOW NUMBER 11.

119
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:26,815
WE'VE MADE MEXICO RICH WITH

120
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:27,850
TRADE.

121
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,852
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF

122
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:30,653
DOLLARS, MILLIONS OF JOBS.

123
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:33,522
AND YET WE STILL HAVE 22 MILLION

124
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,423
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY

125
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,258
ILLEGALLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE

126
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:36,825
MEXICAN.

127
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:38,260
I'M NOT ATTACKING MEXICO OR

128
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,029
MEXICAN PEOPLE, I'M SAYING WE'VE

129
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,030
MADE IN MEXICO RICHER THAN IT

130
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,798
WAS AND WE STILL HAVE AN INFLOW

131
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,833
FROM MEXICO.

132
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:45,868
WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING OUT

133
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:46,201
OF THIS.

134
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,404
>> THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE.

135
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:50,205
YES WE ARE BECAUSE FAR LESS

136
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:50,839
IMMIGRANTS ARE COMING FROM

137
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,641
MEXICO RIGHT NOW.

138
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,043
YOU REFER TO IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE

139
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:54,877
ALREADY HERE FROM MEXICO MANY OF

140
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,280
WHOM CAME A LONG TIME AGO.

141
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:01,550
BEFORE THE BENEFITS OF NAFTA

142
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:02,017
WENT IN PLACE.

143
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:04,620
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA WE DON'T

144
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,055
GET MANY IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO.

145
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:07,556
EVEN YOUR EXAMPLE WERE TALKING

146
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:08,757
ABOUT TODAY IS MIGRANTS FROM

147
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:14,930
HONDURAS, NOT FROM MEXICO.

148
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:18,000
THERE ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF

149
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
NAFTA IN CANDIDLY SUPPORTING

150
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:19,468
THEIR FAMILIES.

151
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,237
IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE.

152
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:23,072
>> Tucker: SINCE YOU YEARS AND

153
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:27,209
THE DATA, LET ME REFER YOU TO

154
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,811
THE ESSENTIAL DATUM IN THIS

155
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:29,244
CONVERSATION.

156
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,113
WE HAVE MORE THAN 10 MILLION

157
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:33,215
MEXICAN CITIZENS LIVING IN OUR

158
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:34,416
BORDERS ILLEGALLY, ONCE AGAIN

159
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,218
I'M NOT ATTACKING THEM, BUT IF

160
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,553
THE MODEL YOU'RE PROPOSING WORKS

161
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,021
AND WE BOTH KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T

162
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:40,589
IT'S ALL A JOKE, IT'S A HUGE LIE

163
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,858
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO MAKE THE

164
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,027
DEMOCRATIC PARTY MORE POWERFUL,

165
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:45,994
LET'S PLAY ALONG -- IF YOUR

166
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,663
MODEL WORKS THEN WHY ARE THEY

167
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:48,330
STILL HEAR?

168
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,698
WHY HAVEN'T THEY GONE BACK TO

169
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,502
THE NEWLY ENRICHED MEXICO WHICH

170
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,203
WE ENRICHED WITH OUR MONEY AND

171
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:56,038
OUR JOBS.

172
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,339
>> MANY CAME FROM A LONG TIME

173
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,141
AGO.

174
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:01,310
THE DATA I'M REFERRING TO IS A

175
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,544
LEGAL IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO

176
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:03,712
HAS GONE DOWN, YOU AGREE WITH ME

177
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,814
ON THAT RIGHT?

178
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,617
>> Tucker: I'M MISSING IT.

179
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,753
THE DATA AS YOU SAID SHOW THAT

180
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:11,687
MEXICO IS WAY RICHER THAN IT WAS

181
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:13,422
20 YEARS AGO.

182
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,824
WE DID THAT, WE SUFFERED AS A

183
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,259
RESULT OF THAT BUT WE ALSO GOT

184
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,594
ALL OF THEIR POOR PEOPLE WHO

185
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:20,395
THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SUPPORTING

186
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:21,130
WITH THEIR NONEXISTENT SOCIAL

187
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,432
SAFETY NET SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE

188
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:24,099
BILLIONAIRES WHICH THEY HAVE

189
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,001
ASSIDUOUSLY DONE.

190
