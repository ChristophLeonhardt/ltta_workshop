how much do you think it would cost to redesign a hydro bill I think the answer is going to shock you folks when I first heard about Ontario's hydro one getting raked over the coals for spending fifteen million dollars on building upgrades I thought oh come on everyone cut him a bit of slack a utility replacing its entire IT system that's not cheap and then I read the fine print which is to say the 15 million dollar price tag well that's not about replacing an IT system nope a bulk of that is going towards simply redesigning that piece of paper that arrives in the mail each month telling you how much you owe even though an increasing number of consumers are opting for online billing these days yet even in the framework of irresponsible public sector utilities that liquidate money at a rate that would make a drunken sailor blush how is it even possible to spend so much on so little indeed NDP energy critic Peter Tobin's nailed it when he asked how this expenditure could possibly be justified when quote families are struggling to keep up with the 300% increase they have seen - hydro rates under the Liberal government end quote now this story dates back to 2016 when hydro one surveyed its customers and discovered that almost half of them had trouble understanding their bills Fierro Phu Julius the company's executive VP of customer care and corporate affairs says the redesign bill is all about giving customers a simpler bill ok simplicity is good no argument here but how do you justify the cost so far some 9 million dollars has gone into the revamp 9 million media reports pooja li s says cosmetic changes to bills account for about 25% of the costs with the rest of the money going toward updating information systems and improving digital building platforms the additional six million hydro one is looking to spend would go towards build and industrial account customers and again I still don't get it how can such a billing redo possibly cost 15 million off the lot and would this ever happen in the private sector case in point it seems that every five years or so the Vancouver Canucks redesigned their garish uniforms almost a half-century later they still can't get it right but that's not the point the point is this you think that even a professional sports team spends anything close to fifteen million dollars on a uniform reboot I mean that's Omar Khadr money but that's how they roll in the public sector at least in Ontario remember the old government of Ontario Trillium logo check it out everything you'd want a logo to be clean simple uncluttered but in 2006 the McGinty Liberals apparently had so many taxpayer dollars burning holes in their pockets that they hired an agency to come up with this cost the taxpayers oh just two hundred nineteen thousand dollars which in Hydra one terms admittedly is chump change but if you're going to change something shouldn't the change be for the better the new Trillium logo is a monstrosity I've stared at this logo many times over I've come to the conclusion that this is an illustration of three deeds lounging in a hot tub or well use your imagination then there's the liquor corruption bureaucracy of Ontario since the LCBO runs a provincial liquor monopoly they could have stores resembling nuclear fallout shelters without any signage whatsoever but the liquor Kratz decided for no good reason whatsoever that they wanted a snazzy new logo for their temples of overpriced hooch so they spent $500,000 now here's what the old logo used to look like here's the new one wow what a difference now the LCBO logo has a curlicue B that's a half-million dollars well spent in my books but again the government of Ontario and the LCBO are mere pikers compared to hydro one a utility that somehow found a very improbable way to spend a lot o 649 jackpot just to redesign its bills wow I think I need to sit down actually I wonder if hi Joe one can lend me an electric chair put me out of my misery once and for all for the rebel dawn media I'm David the men's Wade Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
