so how much your leadership do you think is just natural to you because you're talking about it what I'm hearing is obviously a guy who has tremendous initiative from a very young age I mean to even be from a place where nobody goes in the military and just join the military takes a lot of chutzpah as as my folks would say so what do you think that it really is that leadership is is borders it bread yeah I get asked this question all the time and so it's both it's absolutely both and you as a human being are gonna get a certain characteristics that are gonna make you a good leader and you're gonna lack some characteristics that would make you a good leader if you had them you don't get tens across the board you know it's like the little video games you see kids play where you get a 9 in strength and a and a 7 in intellect and a and an 8 in dexterity and you get those 2 as a leader and you don't get all tense so some leadership characteristics that make you a good leader for instance obviously it's good to be articulate if you can express your message clearly to people that's gonna that's gonna help you from a leadership perspective if you have some natural charisma that's gonna help you from a leadership perspective if you can look at complex problems and you can simplify them that's gonna be helpful as a leader because that's what you're doing so if you're persuasive there's all kinds of things that will help you as a leader and you're not going to be good at all and so as a leader if you look at the ones that you're weak at you can improve them that's that's what's beneficial so you can't take someone that's just a horrible leader and make them into an amazing leader but you can take someone that's a decent leader you can make them into a very good or even an exceptional leader because how you know you can definitely get more articulate you can definitely get more comfortable speaking to people you can definitely get more more precise at taking very complex problems and simplifying them so that your team can understand what it is that needs to get done so these are all things that you can improve upon and I always have to close this out by saying that there are some people that cannot become better leaders and the people that cannot become better leaders are the people that can put their ego in check but they lack humility and those people they think they're doing everything great so they're not going to improve as leaders you can't coach them you can't convince them they think they're perfect and they're gonna stay where they are from a leadership perspective
