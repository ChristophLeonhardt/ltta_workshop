1
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:07,203
JESSE: WELCOME TO.

2
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:10,406
"WATTERS' WORLD."

3
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:11,607
I'M JESSE WATTERS.

4
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:15,945
THERE WAS A BIG BLOWUP ON THE

5
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:16,946
VIEW.

6
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:28,124
MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY, THE

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:28,858
LIBRARY.

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,195
>> I HOPE DEMOCRATS DO RUN A

9
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:34,597
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST BECAUSE YOU

10
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:37,466
WILL LOSE SPECTACULARLY AND I'LL

11
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:40,403
LOOK FORWARD TO ELECTION NIGHT

12
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,471
WHERE I GET TO TELL EVERYBODY I

13
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:43,806
TOLD YOU SO.

14
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:45,908
I THINK YOU SHOULD START PAYING

15
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:53,816
YOU SHOULD.

16
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,451
IT'S DANGEROUS.

17
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:59,889
JESSE: PASSIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,127
BECAUSE A SOCIALIST RISING STAR

19
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:10,466
KNOCKED OFF PELOSI'S PROTEGE.

20
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,968
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ

21
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:13,769
STUMBLED THROUGH WEEKS OF

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,637
GAFFES.

23
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:16,505
>> THIS SOCIALIST LABEL IS

24
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:18,808
SOMETHING THE MEDIA CALLS MORE

25
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:19,108
ABOUT.

26
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,344
I DON'T KNOCK ON A PERSON'S DOOR

27
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:24,547
AND SAY HEY, LET ME TELL YOU

28
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:25,982
ABOUT SOCIALISM.

29
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:29,352
IT'S NOT THANK YOU I CAMPAIGN.

30
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:31,354
IT'S FOX NEWS AND THE MEDIA

31
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:32,888
WANTS TO CONTINUE USING THIS

32
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:33,456
WORD.

33
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:36,225
BY ME SAYING NO, I'M NOT, IT

34
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:37,893
BECOMES A DISTRACTION.

35
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:42,698
JESSE: VENEZUELA, A RICH COUNTRY

36
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:44,300
WITH BLOUNTFUL NATURAL RESOURCES

37
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:47,336
IS NOW A HELL HOLE.

38
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,205
LOOK AT WHAT THE EXPERIMENT WITH

39
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,640
SOCIALISM HAS WROUGHT.

40
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:54,610
NEARLY 90% NOW LIVE IN POVERTY.

41
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:57,113
THE AVERAGE PERSON LAST 24

42
00:01:57,114 --> 00:02:00,216
POUNDS LAST YEAR.

43
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:02,618
SIX PEOPLE ARE -- SICK PEOPLE

44
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,787
ARE TAKING DOG MEDICINE.

45
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:07,123
DELAYS MASSIVE TOILET PAPER

46
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:09,625
SHORTAGE AND IT'S THE MURDER

47
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:13,996
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.

48
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:18,668
DO THEY WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA?

49
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:22,405
THEY SAY WE MEAN SCANDINAVIAN

50
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:23,639
COUNTRIES, THAT'S WHERE

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,207
SOCIALISM WORKS.

52
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:30,246
THE SCANNED NAICHIAN SOCIALIVE

53
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:31,580
SUCCESS STORY IS A FANTASY.

54
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:34,316
YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTRY IS DOING

55
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:35,885
BETTER THAN SWEDEN?

56
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:36,552
SWITZERLAND.

57
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:38,621
SWEDEN WAS GOING OFF A CLIFF

58
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:43,492
UNTIL A DECADE AGO WHEN

59
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,461
CONSERVATIVES TOOK OVER AND

60
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:51,801
IMPLEMENTED CAPITALIST REFORMS.

61
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,803
THE SCANDINAVIA DEFEAT THE

62
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:56,806
NAZIS, PUT A MAN ON THE MOON,

63
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:11,153
TO HUMANKIND FROM SCANDINAVIA?

64
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:11,454
IKEA.

65
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,626
YOU RAISE TAXES ON EVERYBODY IN

66
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:19,595
AMERICA AND IT WON'T MAKE A DENT

67
00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:20,996
IN PAYING THAT BILL.

68
00:03:20,997 --> 00:03:24,700
IF SOCIALISTS DON'T TRUST TRUMP

69
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,469
WHY GIVE THE TRUMP

70
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,770
ADMINISTRATION IN CHARGE YOUR

71
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,205
LIFE.

72
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:32,308
YOU WANT TRUMP TALS YOUR

73
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:34,376
LANDLORD AND RUNNING TOUR

74
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:34,877
COLLEGES?

75
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,146
I THOUGHT DIDN'T LIKE TRUMP

76
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:37,680
UNIVERSITY.

77
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:40,182
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A

78
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,851
HARD ENOUGH TIME TAKING CARE OF

79
00:03:41,852 --> 00:00:00,000
OUR VETS AND SECURING OR BORDERS
