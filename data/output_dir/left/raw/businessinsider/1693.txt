1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,580
there's a very exciting project of foot

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,910
which is to look and understand the

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,289
properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the black hole that is</font>

4
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,449
nearest to us the supermassive black

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,760
hole that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is nearest to us and that is</font>

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,350
the black hole at the center of the

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,529
Milky Way we believe from the motions of

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,750
stars right around it we believe that

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mass of the Milky Way black hole is</font>

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,180
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million times the mass of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Sun</font>

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,390
and so there's this new project does

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,239
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is quite bold which is it</font>

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">uses attempts to use the entire Earth</font>

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,340
the surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the earth is a very large</font>

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,579
radio-telescope dish and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,920
allows you to is to resolve very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
tiny distances around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black hole and</font>

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,030
we are likely to see the shadow of light

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,039
trajectories that sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> are skimming</font>

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,989
around the black hole and there's a very

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular shape and we can actually</font>

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,400
calculate that using Einstein's theory

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,990
of general relativity and this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,390
a limit of the theory when gravity is

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,070
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really strong around black holes</font>

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,979
so this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new test a brand-new</font>

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">test of that regime of the theory which</font>

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,840
hasn't really been done yet right now

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,369
Einstein's theory of general relativity

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,070
has been tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> on cosmic scales from</font>

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,930
this deflection of light and that's sort

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the week limit of the theory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

33
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,400
strong limit is really around black

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,439
holes and so this would be sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,049
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitive test of either</font>

36
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,299
einstein's theory which seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,490
working really well in all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,920
regimes that we've managed to test it

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,549
works or there's some small discrepancy

40
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,829
something new and exciting that points

41
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,710
the way forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new theory we know</font>

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,540
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this theory is inherently</font>

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:00:00,000
incomplete it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the final word</font>
