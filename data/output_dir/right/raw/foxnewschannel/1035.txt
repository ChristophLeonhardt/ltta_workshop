1
00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:02,899
THEIR FUTURE HAS IN STORE.

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,868
ERIC: THANKS SO MUCH.

3
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:08,471
A LOT OF ANTICIPATION.

4
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:11,741
ARTHEL: JOINING ME ON ALL OF HIS

5
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:14,444
IS JOHN PARK.

6
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:16,146
DR. PARK, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

7
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:17,814
I WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN.

8
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:20,550
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS NORTH

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,851
KOREA'S STRATEGY.

10
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:23,953
AND IS KIM JONG-UN TO BE TRUSTED

11
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:26,589
THAT HE'LL OPERATE IN GOOD

12
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:26,890
FAITH?

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,260
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,928
TRANSPORTATION OF THE TOTALITY

15
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:34,731
OF THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP

16
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,065
RE ZWREEM SINGAPORE.

17
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:39,135
THIS ISN'T JUST PURELY FOR THE

18
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:40,703
OPTICS ASPECT OF IT.

19
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:42,572
THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE

20
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:44,274
POTENTIAL LAUNCH OF A PROCESS

21
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:46,276
THAT COULD LEAD TO A LOT OF

22
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,111
DETAILS THAT COULD LEAD TO THE

23
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:51,114
END OF A KOREAN WAR.

24
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:54,050
WHAT WOULD A DENUCLEARIZATION

25
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,051
PROCESS LOOK LIKE.

26
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:57,053
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THIS

27
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:57,520
PROCESS.

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,522
THERE IS DEEP DISTRUST ON BOTH

29
00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:00,490
SIDES.

30
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,592
BUT THESE TWO LEADERS ARE

31
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:04,227
CLEARLY UNCONVENTIONAL BY THE

32
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:06,062
STANDARD OF THEIR RESPECTIVE

33
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:06,529
COUNTRIES.

34
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:09,132
SO THERE IS A STREAMLINED

35
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:11,134
APPROACH FOR THESE TWO LEADERS

36
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:13,670
TO ENGAGE TO LAUNCH THIS PROCESS

37
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,204
GOING FORWARD.

38
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,306
ARTHEL: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING

39
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:20,877
THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN A

40
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:22,011
PHOTO-OP.

41
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,079
WHAT SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY

42
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,881
TO KIM JONG-UN IN THIS MEETING.

43
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,416
>> A LOT OF THE THINGS HAVE

44
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,283
ALREADY BEEN SAID.

45
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:29,619
WE HAVE SEEN A UNIQUE ARRAY OF

46
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:29,986
PERSONNEL.

47
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:31,888
WE ARE NOW POTENTIALLY SEEING

48
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:34,190
THE BEGINNING OF A ROBUST

49
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,891
PROCESS GOING FORWARD.

50
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:37,293
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF UPS AND

51
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:38,428
DOWNS IN THAT PROCESS.

52
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:41,297
BUT AS THE UNDER CASE OF THE

53
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,565
FORD MOVEMENT.

54
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:45,101
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO IS A

55
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,536
CRITICAL PLAYER.

56
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:52,709
WE HAVE HAD CUNNING  *'S MAIN

57
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,144
ADVISOR KIM YONG CHOL IN THE

58
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:56,746
WHITE HOUSE.

59
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:58,848
ARTHEL: THERE IS A LOT OF GROUND

60
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:02,252
WORK COVERED.

61
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:08,925
SHOULD THE U.S. STAND STEADFAST,

62
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:09,925
DENUCLEARIZATION OR BUST?

63
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:11,594
>> THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT

64
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:12,362
MOVING PIECES.

65
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,564
THERE IS A COMPONENT THAT IN

66
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:16,332
MANY RESPECTS THE LARGER GAME

67
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:18,902
PLAN IS THIS IDEA HOW DO WE LINK

68
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,570
THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS.

69
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,873
THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE HAD THEIR

70
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:26,976
BIG SUMMIT.

71
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:29,479
THEY LAID OUT A DECLARATION.

72
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,851
THE BIG PART ABOUT MOVING FORD,

73
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:37,820
DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY, THE EARLY

74
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,723
LISTING WILL BE DONE BY SOUTH

75
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:41,758
KOREA AND CHINA.

76
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:44,193
BUT IN ORDER TO GET THERE, THERE

77
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:47,697
HAS TO BE PROGRESS ON THE

78
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,165
DENUCLEARIZATION PIECE.

79
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:51,501
ARTHEL: IS THAT A YES.

80
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:55,238
IS IT DENUCLEARIZATION OR BUST

81
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:56,306
OR NOT?

82
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,741
>> IT WILL BE A KEY COMPONENT.

83
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,443
BUT THE MANAGING OF THE

84
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,878
EXPECTATIONS IS WHO DOES WHAT

85
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:02,812
WHEN AND HOW.

86
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:05,148
IT'S THE CORE ELEMENT BUT IT'S

87
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:06,950
HOW IT'S DONE THAT IS THE BASIS

88
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,755
OF HOW WE SEE THE FORWARD

89
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:13,122
MOVEMENT.

90
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,091
THEY WILL WERE PRESIDENT TRUMP

91
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:20,597
RELYING ON HIS GUT IN

92
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:21,598
RELYING ON HIS GUT DN

93
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:23,967
RELYING ON HIS GUT D GUT

94
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:24,500
INSTINCTS.

95
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,036
' HE SAID HE CAN READ KIM

96
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,504
JONG-UN WITHIN A MINUTE OF

97
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:29,272
MEETING HIM.

98
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:32,075
>> IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE

99
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:32,842
FOOTAGE.

100
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:35,645
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN A

101
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:36,980
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

102
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,719
BEFORE JUST A FEW MONTHS, HE WAS

103
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,955
AN ENIGMA.

104
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,024
WE HAD SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO

105
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:50,727
MEET WITH KIM JONG-UN.

106
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,062
PREVIOUS AMERICAN SIT EVEN WHO

107
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,665
MET WITH KIM JONG-UN WAS DENNIS

108
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:56,499
RODMAN.

109
00:03:56,499 --> 00:04:00,003
BUT HE'S VERY MEASURES IN HIS

110
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:00,370
MEETINGS.

111
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,106
WITH THE WORDS AND DIALOGUE ON

112
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,108
THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE WILL BE

113
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:05,475
MEASURED.

114
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,577
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SIDE THE

115
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:10,146
ENGAGE, CAN I MAKE THE DEALS

116
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:12,315
GOING FORWARD.

117
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:15,184
AND IT'S NO EASY FEAT.

118
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,653
IT'S THIS IDEA IN STARTING THIS

119
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:18,321
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

120
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:21,457
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES COMING UP

121
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:24,260
ALONG THE WAY.

122
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,499
ARTHEL: HOW KEY ARE THEY?

123
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:33,136
YOU HAVE TWO LARGER THAN LIFE

124
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:33,903
PLAYERS.

125
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,571
YOU LAID OUT THE ROAD LEADING UP

126
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,573
TO THIS IN TERMS OF THE GROUND

127
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:38,374
WORK TAKING PLACE.

128
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:40,476
WHAT ABOUT THESE TWO LEADERS

129
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:41,044
THEMSELVES.

130
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,112
DOES THE BUCK STOP WITH THEM?

131
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,581
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE TWO

132
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,250
STRUCTURES WE ARE SEEING A

133
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,718
STREAMLINING OF PROCESSES THAT

134
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:51,521
MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S THE

135
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:51,821
CASE.

136
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,089
IT'S UNPRECEDENTED HOW WE HAVE

137
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,425
SOONER THE TOP-DOWN APPROACH.

138
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,660
THE TWO LEADERS AGREED TOP MOVE

139
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,929
FORWARD AND DELEGATED KEY

140
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:02,899
INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

141
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:04,333
MIDDLE LEVEL WORKING GROUPS,

142
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,537
THEN YOU ESCALATE HIGHER UP AS

143
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:08,237
YOU SEE MORE PROGRESS.

144
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:11,007
THEY ARE YOU NEXT SENSE THIS IS

145
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,942
HAVE MUCH ABOUT DEAL MAKING.

146
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:15,044
THE IDEA OF THE TRADITIONAL

147
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,512
MODEL IN THE WAY NEGOTIATIONS

148
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,314
HAVE COMMON THE PAST, THEY

149
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:19,315
FACTOR IN.

150
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:20,883
IT'S VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THESE

151
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:22,985
INDIVIDUALS AND HOW THEY SEE THE

152
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:23,953
PATH AHEAD.

153
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:27,056
ARTHEL: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

154
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,659
ROLES PLAYED BY DIFFERENT

155
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:30,626
NATIONS.

156
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:33,162
I LIKE TO DESCRIBE AS PRESIDENT

157
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:39,869
MOON SCRAPED OFF THE PLAQUE OFF

158
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,304
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO

159
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:41,637
NATIONS.

160
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,674
>> IF YOU RECALL THE HE VERNLTS

161
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:47,343
JUST BEFORE THE DECLARATION, WE

162
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:49,779
SAW DIPLOMATIC BREAKTHROUGHS.

163
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,547
THE USE OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS

164
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:53,883
IN SOUTH KOREA WAS THE BEGINNING

165
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:57,353
OF THIS PROCESS.

166
00:05:57,353 --> 00:06:01,657
BUT PRESIDENT MOON ON THE SOUTH

167
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,993
KOREAN SIDE TOOK THE EARLY RISK.

168
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:06,562
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SOUTH KOREAN

169
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:08,097
ROLE, THEY WILL SEEK TO CLOSE

170
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:08,598
GAPS.

171
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:11,400
WHEN THERE WAS AN EARLY GAP

172
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,635
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

173
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,504
CHAIRMAN KIM, PRESIDENT MOON DID

174
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,873
A LOT TO TRY TO CLOSE THOSE

175
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:17,173
GAPS.

176
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:20,810
AND HE HAS THAT UNIQUE ROLE TOP

177
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,044
PLAY GOING FORWARD.

178
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,380
ARTHEL: WHAT ABOUT CHINA AND

179
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,615
RUSSIA AND JAPAN.

180
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,850
>> EVEN SOME OF THE HIGH-PROFILE

181
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,286
EVENTS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE BECOME

182
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:31,087
BACKGROUND NOISE.

183
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:36,125
KIM JONG-UN HAS MET WITH XI

184
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,327
JINPING TWICE NOW.

185
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:39,562
IT'S REMARKABLE THE HELP THEY

186
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:41,964
HAVE BEEN GETTING FROM THE

187
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:44,934
CHINESE SIDE.

188
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:48,437
KIM JONG-UN ARRIVED IN SINGAPORE

189
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:50,339
ON A CHINESE AIRCRAFT.

190
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,775
THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT

191
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,343
THE SUPPORT COMING FROM THE

192
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:55,111
CHINESE SIDE.

193
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:56,646
RUSSIA IS STILL IN THE

194
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:57,547
BACKGROUND.

195
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,415
THIS IDEA OF TRYING TO ESTABLISH

196
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,117
A DIRECT CONNECTION.

197
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:06,189
CHAIRMAN KIM HASN'T MET WITH

198
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,623
VLADIMIR PUTIN YET.

199
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:09,125
PRIME MINISTER ABE IS TRYING TO

200
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,393
GET THAT KIND OF CONNECTION.

201
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:12,628
IF WE SEE THE BROADER MOVEMENT

202
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:15,031
IN THESE MECHANISMS THERE COULD

203
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:16,833
BE A STATE.

204
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,203
BUT GETTING THE DENUCLEARIZATION

205
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:21,537
PROCESS UNDER WAY WOULD CREATE

206
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:24,173
THE SPACE FOR OTHER MECHANISMS

207
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:24,574
UNDER WAY.

208
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:27,210
WE ARE PUTTING A LOT OF FOCUS ON

209
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,444
THIS MEETING IN SINGAPORE.

210
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:30,680
ARTHEL: AS REPRESENTED IN THIS

211
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,616
PHOTO POSTED BY GERMAN

212
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:36,185
CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL'S CAMP.

213
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,920
THERE WAS CLEARLY SOME

214
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,455
CONTENTIOUS MOMENTS.

215
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:43,893
NOW YOU HAVE THIS TWITTER FEUD

216
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,295
WITH CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER

217
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,496
JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND PRESIDENT

218
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,264
TRUMP.

219
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:50,466
DOES THIS AFFECT LEVERAGE ON THE

220
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,668
LEVEL GOING INTO THE SUMMIT WITH

221
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:53,169
KIM JONG-UN?

222
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,037
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE U.S.

223
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:59,508
TEAM TO MAKE THAT

224
00:07:59,508 --> 00:07:59,976
DIFFERENTIATION.

225
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:02,612
THERE IS ALSO SOME ISSUES IN

226
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,982
BETWEEN THE BILATERAL RIPS

227
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,984
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE

228
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:11,754
RESPECTED EUROPEAN LEADERS.

229
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:13,522
BUT THIS ALL NEW.

230
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:18,060
IN ONE SENSE THE COMPARISON IS

231
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,731
MULTI LADD LATERAL.

232
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:24,233
AND THIS IDEA HE'S IN CONTROL.

233
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,369
IN THAT DYNAMIC IT'S IMPORTANT

234
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,271
TO SHIFT THE FOCUS AND

235
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:30,673
APPRECIATE THIS IS A DIFFERENT

236
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:31,007
SETTING.

237
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,707
THEY WILL THERE ARE EVERYONE IS

238
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,044
HOPEFUL FOR A POSITIVE OUTCOME.

239
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:39,881
WHERE ARE THE CONSEQUENTIAL

240
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:41,150
PITFALLS?

241
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:50,927
>> IN NORTH KOREA'S FIELD, IT'S

242
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:53,129
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF

243
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:53,763
COUNTRIES DOING DIFFERENT

244
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:54,230
THINGS.

245
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,865
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT TO LOOK

246
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:56,332
FOR.

247
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:59,735
I THINK THIS IDEA OF A JOINT

248
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,338
LAYING OUT THE KEY GOALS OF THE

249
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:03,873
RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES HERE, THE

250
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:05,975
UNITED STATES LOOK AT REDUCING

251
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,643
THIS THREAT FROM THE NORTH

252
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:11,013
KOREANS AND MOVING FORD WITH

253
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:11,914
DENUCLEARIZATION.

254
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:14,283
THE POTENTIAL ELIMINATION OF A

255
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:15,518
POLICY AND SECURITY GUARANTEE

256
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:18,154
WOULD LEAD TO THE BASIS OF THE

257
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:19,088
OFFICIAL LAUNCH.

258
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,923
THESE ARE THE AREAS A LOT OF

259
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:22,191
WORK HAS BEEN DONE.

260
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:23,960
RATHER THAN GOING TO THE TABLE

261
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,628
AND NEGOTIATING FROM SCRATCH,

262
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,596
THIS IDEA OF REVIEWING WHAT HAS

263
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,398
BEEN PEAF CHEEFD UP UNTIL NOW

264
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:31,100
AND MAKING THIS DECISION OF THE

265
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,036
OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF THE

266
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:34,937
DENUCLEARIZATION PROCESS.

267
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:37,073
ARTHEL: I WANT TO ASK YOU, WHAT

268
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:39,375
DO YOU THINK WOULD BE CONSIDERED

269
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,810
REAL 60s EXPECTATIONS COMING

270
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,311
OUT OF THIS MEETING?

271
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:44,914
>> WE HAVE SEEN THE MANAGING

272
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:45,681
EXPECTATIONS.

273
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:48,684
BUT THE REALISTIC STEPS FORD, I

274
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:50,820
CAN APPROACH IT FROM A SLIGHTLY

275
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,487
DIFFERENT ANGLE.

276
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:54,991
A LOT HAS BEEN DONE BELOW THE

277
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:56,192
SURFACE.

278
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,893
WE'LL SEE MORE OF IT AFTER THE

279
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:58,327
SUMMIT.

280
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:00,096
BUT THE FACT IT'S BEEN IN THE

281
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:01,864
WORKS FOR A WHILE.

282
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:03,733
THAT'S A PIECE OF IT I THINK WE

283
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,868
ARE GOING TO SEAT ANNOUNCEMENT

284
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:08,270
OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MORE OR

285
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,673
LESS AGREED TO.

286
00:10:10,673 --> 00:00:00,000
ARTHEL: WE ARE GOING TO CALL
