00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,269
welcome to TV I live today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're here</font>

2
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,820
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the big news at AOL this</font>

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,559
morning Tim Armstrong and now said to be

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,450
letting<font color="#E5E5E5"> go about third of the staff or</font>

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,340
2,500 employees and a move that's

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,170
supposed to save the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company about three</font>

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,490
hundred million dollars now while the

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,990
move was expected it still seemed to

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,359
have caught AOL employees off guard a

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,830
lot of them are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,109
shocked but perhaps they shouldn't be

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,969
Nick well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're shocked</font>

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,350
because it's always surprising when your

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">company goes through layoffs but I think</font>

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,260
also there was a report about a week ago

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,420
that they'd cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifteen hundred or a</font>

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,190
thousand people but we pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,480
always figured all along they needed to

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut about 2,000 people if not more and</font>

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,559
why why<font color="#CCCCCC"> did they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,660
many people well a couple reasons I mean

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big one is that al is going to be a</font>

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,960
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of company going forward</font>

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,510
it's it's it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a content</font>

25
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,670
production company sort of in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vein</font>

26
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,039
of Gawker Media except a lot bigger so

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,969
Gawker has nine sites and their HR their

28
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,510
sales their editorial it's all about 140

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,580
people so if you extrapolate that over

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,409
you know the hundred sites that AOL has

31
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,210
that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,700 people I mean that's</font>

32
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,560
just a rough estimate but it gives you

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">an idea of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more people AOL has</font>

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,150
right now then it needs to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind</font>

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">of business and then to that end we've</font>

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,140
heard talk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was going to be a</font>

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,939
limitation of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their photo</font>

38
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,220
department because that's just not

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,659
something that's necessary and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

40
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,060
vlogging kind of media business that's a

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,860
that's it that's it that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good sort</font>

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of way to look at it it's like you see</font>

43
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,170
they're getting rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all these</font>

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,840
editorial photo journalists and photo

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,909
editors and they're gonna ask their

46
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,460
content writers to just hey find a photo

47
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,590
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on site you know a lot cheaper</font>

48
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way that's what we do it that's</font>

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,659
what a lot of smaller upstart companies

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,570
do so you've also heard about what the

51
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,310
severance packages are shaping up like

52
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,960
for the employees yeah let me go to my

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,930
notes yeah so okay so for the senior

54
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">vice-president level it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

55
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,950
the what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is they're</font>

56
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,170
getting the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this whole</font>

57
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">layoffs is it's a voluntary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layoff</font>

58
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,469
program so they're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> incentivize</font>

59
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,169
people to quit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own ahead of the</font>

60
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">company's spin-off so they have to let</font>

61
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,390
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about December</font>

62
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,610
so if you let you all know that you're

63
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to quit before december fourth and</font>

64
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,790
you're a senior vice president you get

65
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,650
nine months severance<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare and</font>

66
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,810
outplacement services if you don't let

67
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,700
them know and you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up getting canned</font>

68
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,740
in q1 then you only get four months

69
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,750
severance so for vice-presidents it's

70
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,000
six months versus four months for the

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,530
director level it's four months versus

72
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,270
two months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the sub director</font>

73
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,920
level it's three months versus one month

74
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,860
and you were saying or have you heard do

75
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,790
you think that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

76
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,190
taking these buyouts what is your

77
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,020
feeling on this yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I've heard</font>

78
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,760
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard it both ways you know so i</font>

79
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">think i've heard some from actually from</font>

80
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content side people are like saying</font>

81
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know this isn't that attractive I</font>

82
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,950
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it people in</font>

83
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,360
media it's not exactly a great job

84
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,100
market out there anyway so a lot of them

85
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,170
are like oh I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to stay here but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

86
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,330
have heard other people saying this is a

87
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,010
pretty good offer AOL seems kind of like

88
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,540
a mess this makes you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

89
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,430
mess because it's another layoff I'm out

90
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,920
of here you know so Andy and you know

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,760
another sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of strategy for this this</font>

92
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,459
buyout strategy is that it um it kind of

93
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,860
gets people to who are what willing to

94
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,840
bet against AOL out of the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

95
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,450
makes a lot of sense you know so if you

96
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,560
stay with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company you're going to</font>

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,230
get stock in AOL after the spin-off you

98
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,730
know and if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get laid off you</font>

99
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,200
know you're you're working for a company

100
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,670
and you have stock in it and that

101
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,290
presumably you think it's going to go up

102
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,820
and that's why you're there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

103
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,170
know if you're a senior vice president

104
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,970
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been there for years you think</font>

105
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,040
the strategy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work this</font>

106
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,540
is your way of saying you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

107
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,970
rather just have an extra you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

108
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,430
months to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a new job or just collect</font>

109
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,620
two paychecks then take a 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> l stock</font>

110
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,299
though it's getting rid of some dead

111
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,500
wood people who don't believe in the

112
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,329
strategy which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart you know and I</font>

113
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,980
also you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> applaud Tim for cutting</font>

114
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,200
so deep so fast I mean a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

115
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,390
the worst thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to do this drip</font>

116
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,980
drip drip strategy we're not cutting

117
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,260
deep enough fast enough and this way you

118
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,610
get it done you get it over<font color="#CCCCCC"> with him and</font>

119
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,290
it's collaborative the employees get to

120
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,970
participate so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's pretty</font>

121
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,180
pretty well handled

122
00:04:08,180 --> 00:00:00,000
you
