1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
you spoke on behalf of the president

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,909
quoting him on the jobs report on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday</font>

3
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,589
you said they may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been floating in</font>

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,569
the past but it's very real now I guess

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,160
the questionnaire very real name they

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,630
are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> real now the question is given</font>

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,460
a key again right when should Americans

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,809
trust the president should they trust

9
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,940
the president is it phonier real when he

10
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,170
says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> president obama</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

11
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,029
wiretapping well again let's let's get

12
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,470
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think there's two things that are</font>

13
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">important about what he said I think</font>

14
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,279
recognizing that it's the Obon he

15
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,210
doesn't really think that President

16
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,160
Obama went up and tapped his phone

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,109
personally I think but but I think

18
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,640
there's a there's no question that the

19
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,679
Obama administration that there were

20
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,420
actions about surveillance and other

21
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,980
activities that are card in the 2016

22
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,149
election that is a widely reported

23
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:40,590
activity that occurred back then the

24
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,719
president used the word wiretap in

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,480
quotes to mean broadly surveillance and

26
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,760
other activities during that can you say

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,410
affordably that whatever the president

28
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">said something we can trust it to be</font>

29
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">really if he's not joking of course I</font>
