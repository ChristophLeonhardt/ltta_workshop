>> TAX BREAKS IS MISNOMER.

37
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:52,328
REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT AKA

00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:53,396
WELFARE PAYMENT, BASICALLY.

39
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:54,931
THIS IS A STATE THAT JUST

40
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,632
ENACTED A GAS TAX THAT IS

41
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:57,767
DRIVING THE WORKING PEOPLE

42
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:01,738

43
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:02,839
I'M GOING TO REPEAL THAT

00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:03,606
THIS IS JUST A GOVERNMENT

45
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,608
THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL AND

46
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,309
DOESN'T RESPOND TO THE

47
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:07,410
PEOPLE.

48
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,544
NOW, GAVIN NEWSOM IS THE GUY

49
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:09,812
I'M RUNNING AGAINST.

50
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:11,647
HE WANTS TO DOUBLE THE

51
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,282
INCOME TAX ON WORKING

52
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:13,716
CALIFORNIANS.

53
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,184
HE WANTS TO INCREASE

54
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,253
PROPERTY TAXES AND HE WANTS

55
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:21,190
TO KEEP THIS GAS TAX THEN

56
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,825
THEY ARE PROPOSING TO GIVE

57
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:24,394
WELFARE PAYMENTS TO ILLEGAL

58
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:24,727
ALIENS.

59
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:25,728
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU THEY

60
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:27,997

00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:29,632
GIVING FREE MEDICAID TO

62
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:29,999
ILLEGALS.

63
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,034
THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO

64
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,535

NOT WANT THAT.

68
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:39,642
THEY ARE SICK OF HIGH TAX

69
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,043
CALIFORNIA.

70
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,077
I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

71
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:42,011
MAKE A CHANGE IN NOVEMBER

72
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,347
AND THEY ARE GOING TO ELECT

73
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:44,680

00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,048
ABBY: WOW.

75
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:45,848

CAMPAIGN FOR JOHN COX AS

92
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,667
MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

93
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,835
HE FEELS THAT'S ONLY GOING

94
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:06,636
TO HELP HIM.

95
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:07,203

00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,011
AND, OF COURSE, HE WANTS

100
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:18,281
THIS ALL TO BE ABOUT

101
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,482
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS I POINTED

102
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:20,883
OUT MANY TIMES, PRESIDENT

103
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:21,717
TRUMP DIDN'T CREATE ROADS

104
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:22,618
THAT ARE SOME OF THE WORST

105
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:23,586
IN THE NATION AND MORE

106
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,154
EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER

107
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:25,455
STATE.

108
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:26,389
HE DIDN'T -- PRESIDENT TRUMP

109
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:27,824
DIDN'T CREATE A SCHOOL

110
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:31,294
SYSTEM THAT RANKS 45TH IN

111
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:32,195
THE NATION?

112
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,229
STATE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH

113
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,397
WATER BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN

114
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:35,431
TEARING DOWN RESERVOIRS

115
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,632
INSTEAD OF BUILDING THEM.

116
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:39,068
THIS STATE HAS THE WORST TAX

117
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:40,369
ENVIRONMENT, THE WORST

118
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,370
BUSINESS CLIMATE.

119
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,071
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD NOTHING

120
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:43,673
TO DO WITH THAT.

121
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:44,440
PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T

122
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,608
CREATE THE SANCTUARY STATE

123
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,343
IN THIS STATE.

124
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,579
GAVIN NEWSOM DID THAT.

125
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,246
ABBY: DO YOU THINK IT WOULD

126
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,414
HELP OR HURT TO YOU HAVE THE

127
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:52,014

00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:52,949
YOU.

130
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:53,783

131
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:54,650
PRESIDENT TO BE OUT HERE.

132
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,854
BECAUSE HE IS A BUSINESSMAN.

133
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:59,222
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.

134
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,524
I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THE

135
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:02,492
MISMANAGEMENT OF THIS STATE.

136
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,626
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER

137
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,228
THE MANAGEMENT HERE, AND

138
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,162
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

139
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:06,996
LIVABLE STATE.

140
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,664
A STATE THAT IS NOT THE

141
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:09,565
LAUGHING STOCK OF THE

142
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,234
COUNTRY BUT IS ACTUALLY THE

143
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,836
SHINING CITY ON A HILL THAT

144
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:14,570
PRESIDENT REAGAN, WHO WAS

145
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,906
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA

146
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,274
BEFORE THAT, HE TALKED ABOUT

147
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:18,941
THAT.

148
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,675
GRIFF: THAT'S AN INTERESTING

149
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:20,776
POINT, JOHN.

150
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:21,477
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

151
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:22,845
RATINGS NOW ARE SIMILAR TO

152
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,514
WHAT RONALD REAGAN'S WAS AT

153
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:25,681
HIS SAME TIME IN HIS

154
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:26,082
PRESIDENCY.

155
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,183
>> ABSOLUTELY.

156
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:28,417
GRIFF: LET ME ASK YOU THIS

157
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,418
THOUGH, AS GOES CALIFORNIA

158
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,720

159
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,954

160
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:33,022
HANDBOOK ON BEING THE

161
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:35,558
HEADQUARTERS OF THE

162
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:35,958
RESISTANCE.

163
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,093
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WHY WILL

164
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,661
SEE A NOVEMBER SOMETHING

165
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:39,262
HAPPENING THAT DOESN'T

166
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,463
AMOUNT TO THAT BLUE WAVE AND

167
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:42,265
THAT THE REST OF THE

168
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:45,635
COUNTRY, DEMOCRATS THAT IS,

169
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:47,403
WILL MAKE THAT MISTAKE.

170
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,605
>> I'M GOING TO NATIONALIZE

171
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:50,039
THIS RACE.

172
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,007
THIS STATE AND THIS RACE

173
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,308
HERE IS GOING TO BE THE

174
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:53,376
RESISTANCE TO THE

175
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:53,776
RESISTANCE.

176
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,544
THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT

NEWSOM.

181
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,782
WE'RE SICK OF THE SWAMP.

182
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,918
I'M GOING TO CLEAN OUT THE

00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:03,853
GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT

185
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:05,288
THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET

186
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,490
THIS STATE MANAGED PROPERLY
