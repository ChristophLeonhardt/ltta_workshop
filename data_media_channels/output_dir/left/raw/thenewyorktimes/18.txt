1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:12,860
Deep in the mud,
they find one — a body.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,760
It appears to be a young girl,
but her head is missing.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,602
No one will know her name.

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,540
She’s brought here:
a mass grave

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,940
on the outskirts of town.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,495
This is Palu, Indonesia.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,190
It’s been almost two weeks
since an earthquake

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,800
and tsunami ravaged this city.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,070
Thousands of buildings
collapsed, 20-foot waves

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,490
crashed into the shore.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,010
In places, the soil
flowed like liquid,

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,650
sweeping away
entire neighborhoods.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,830
More than 2,000 have died.

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,967
Now, officials say about
5,000 are still missing.

15
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,135
We came here to
meet the survivors.

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,630
Everyone was searching
for someone.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,680
Soon, the government will
end the formal search

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,750
for human remains.

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,680
It’s clear that there’s
no one left to save.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,280
But people here wait and watch,
hoping at least for a chance

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,680
to bury their dead.

22
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,980
Riana Asnuwair is looking
for her mother.

23
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,350
Ismail is a taekwondo coach.

24
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,350
Eight of his students
are still missing.

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,150
He’s here every day.

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,470
At the end of another hard day,
a family buries its dead.

27
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,580
Zulkifli watched as the
earth swallowed his wife

28
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,830
and 7-year-old son.

29
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,598
Nine days later, rescuers
found their bodies.

30
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,896
They were still
holding each other.

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,790
In such a broken place,

32
00:03:29,790 --> 00:00:00,000
this is what’s left to hope for:
a chance to say goodbye.
