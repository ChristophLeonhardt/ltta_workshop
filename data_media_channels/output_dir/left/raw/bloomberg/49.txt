1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,981
(slow electronic music)

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:05,309
The university of Alberta has

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:06,892
a lot going for it.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
It's pretty.

5
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:13,661
Its bear collection is on point.

6
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:17,589
(slow electronic music)

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:22,172
And it's home to many an
eccentric and clever inventor.

8
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:24,861
Are you human?

9
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:29,501
Of course not, but that
shouldn't keep us from chatting.

10
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:32,229
Like this fella, Kory Mathewson,

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,661
an AI researcher who
comes with a sidekick.

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,994
(slow electronic music)

13
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,548
Tell me about this guy a
little bit, or is this it?

14
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:47,381
Sure.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,341
(both laugh)

16
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,829
So this is Blueberry.

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,821
On Blueberry, I've
deployed the improv system.

18
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,749
So there's an artificial
improv system running

19
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:57,666
on Blueberry right now.

20
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,181
Yes, that's right.

21
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,264
Kory does improv comedy with a robot.

22
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:06,064
I've been doing improv longer than

23
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:07,129
I've been doing computing science.

24
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,560
I've been doing it for 12 years

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,109
and I thought, you know, there's no more

26
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,280
natural convergence than taking some

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,680
of these state of the art systems

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,901
and putting them up on stage.

29
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,409
One day, we'll make it to the moon

30
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,576
if this planet is not to be our last.

31
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,709
I keep thinking there's,
like, a ventriloquist

32
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,445
or this is like a new age.

33
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,138
That's a really good way to put it, yeah.

34
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:40,378
With a strange twist on it.

35
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,080
The piece that's different is that

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,308
I don't know what it will say.

37
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,949
Anything that comes from the system,

38
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:48,938
it's generating live in the moment.

39
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:50,427
Blueberry I created you.

40
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:52,680
I downloaded a voice into your brain

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,519
so that you could perform
in front of these people.

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,469
So they do not know
what I am going to say?

43
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,447
I don't know what you're
going to say either!

44
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:03,858
To give Blueberry the power

45
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,776
of surreal Canadian improv,

46
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:08,038
Kory first had to create an AI

47
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,288
that could bring the funny.

48
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,815
Step one: he feeds Blueberry the dialogue

49
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:20,065
from a bunch of movies,
102,000 movies to be exact.

50
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:26,055
All the movies, every movie for 100 years.

51
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:28,293
And that's just so it can learn language,

52
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,594
see how somebody responds
to somebody else.

53
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:33,946
That's exactly right, it builds
kind of a language model.

54
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,674
Step two: he trains Blueberry

55
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:38,554
just like you'd train a dog.

56
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,546
Rewarding it when it makes sense,

57
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:45,055
and punishing it when
it spits out gibberish.

58
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:49,226
Time to put this wannabe
Kid in the Hall to the test.

59
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,059
Here we go.

60
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:51,559
Start improvising.

61
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,393
Okay campers, we're going to get ready

62
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,546
for a real baseball game!

63
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,946
Grab your gloves and
grab your baseball bats,

64
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:02,144
and let's get out there!

65
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:04,227
Especially you, Franklin!

66
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:11,645
Okay, okay. Well, why aren't
you ready for the match?

67
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:19,073
Okay, come on Franklin, you
know how I feel about you,

68
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:23,573
but you've gotta keep your
head in the game right now.

69
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:27,956
He's threatening you!

70
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:28,789
I know!

71
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:37,778
Oh Jesus, put down the bat,
Franklin! What are you doing?

72
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,946
I've got nothing to hide. Look!

73
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,346
This is all I am!

74
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:44,766
Okay, we'll end it there.

75
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,599
That's great!

76
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,797
That's how it works.

77
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:49,037
Obviously, some of the responses
are a little bit weird,

78
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:50,048
but then it's really funny,

79
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:51,856
because then as you're going along,

80
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,146
it did hit a couple of things perfectly,

81
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:58,098
and then it's like, it's extra hilarious,

82
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:00,015
because now it's going.

83
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:03,186
Blueberry may not be ready

84
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:06,528
for its Second City audition just yet.

85
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,778
But Kory has a higher
purpose: making AI relatable.

86
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,366
Oh it's gonna move, it's gonna move.

87
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,616
(laughter)

88
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,583
There is a fear in society of AI.

89
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,726
So, we are kind of humanizing this AI.

90
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:26,258
We're taking it down a peg,

91
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,256
we're saying don't be afraid of this tech,

92
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:32,288
look at how cute it is, look
at how kind of naive it is.

93
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:33,926
(laughter)

94
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:35,904
You've done it again, Blueberry!

95
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:37,106
Isn't there a flip side to that though?

96
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:40,887
Then you make it cute and then
people start to accept it?

97
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,568
You know, then we wake up and...?

98
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:44,401
(laughter)

99
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:47,578
I mean, I don't think that
will happen in my time.

100
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,138
Hm.

101
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:51,477
I'm sorry you had to hear that, Blueberry.

102
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:54,786
When you're ready to turn
Kory into a human puppet,

103
00:04:54,786 --> 00:00:00,000
give me a ring, and
we'll bring the cameras.
