WE ARE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU TOMORROW WITH US. EXCEPT ME, I WILL BE IN D.C. Bret: THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT, AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A MAJOR SETBACK IN WHAT HAS BEEN WIDELY PERCEIVED AS PROGRESS TOWARDS PEACE AND OF THE ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. NORTH KOREA IS THREATENING TO CANCEL NEXT MONTH'S SUMMIT BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND A PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER MILITARY DRILLS GOING ON RIGHT NOW, INVOLVING THE U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA. THIS NEWS WAS REPORTED BY THE SOUTH KOREAN NEWS AGENCY EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. IT COULD VERY WELL BE A WAKE-UP CALL TO SOME WHO THOUGHT THAT THINGS HAD COMPLETELY CHANGED BETWEEN PYANGYOUNG AND WASHINGTON. SIGNS OF TURBULENCE IN A REASONABLY SMOOTH RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PYANGYOUNG AND THE U.S. COUNSELING A MEETING BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS NORTH AND SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIAL OFFICIALS. NORTH KOREAN STATE MEDIA GOING ON TO SAY THE UNITED STATES WILL ALSO HAVE TO UNDERTAKE CAREFUL DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THE FATE OF THE U.S. SUMMIT IN LIGHT OF THIS PROVOCATIVE MILITARY RUCKUS JOINTLY CONDUCTED WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES. THE DRILLS ARE NOT PROVOCATIVE. KIM JONG UN HAS SAID HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED STATES THAT WE CONDUCT THESE JOINT EXERCISES, AND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO GO ON. AS FOR THE SUMMIT PLAN FOR SINGAPORE IN JUNE, WASHINGTON IS GOING FORWARD WITH PLANNING. SOME, HOWEVER WERE CAUTIOUS ABOUT KIM JONG UN'S RECENT WORDS. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TRUST HIM, ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK IT'S GOOD WE HAVE A DIRECT DIALOGUE. AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE SIGNS THAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY THAT THE SUMMIT COULD BE SUCCESSFUL. Reporter: NORTH KOREA IS GOING AHEAD WITH DISMANTLING ITS NUCLEAR TEST SITE AND IS SHUT SET TO BE SHUT DOWN NEXT WEEK. THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE PRIORITIZATION IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ON DENUCLEARIZATION, BECAUSE THAT'S THE GOAL THAT WE SET. Reporter: STILL SOME WAY THAT EVEN IF THEY DO SIT SHOW UP AT THE SUMMIT, THEY ONLY OFFER PHASED DISARMAMENT TO THE UNITED STATES. WHEN KIM JONG UN SEES PRESIDENT TRUMP IN SINGAPORE, HE SHOULD GIVE SOMETHING BIG TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. Bret: A STATEMENT THE WHITE HOUSE REALLY IS JUST A SHORT TIME AGO SAID, WE ARE AWARE OF THE SOUTH KOREAN MEDIA REPORT. THE UNITED STATES WILL LOOK AT WHAT NORTH KOREA HAS SAID
