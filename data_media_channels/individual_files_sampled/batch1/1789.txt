Wednesday in Regensburg is market day and for Hoonah Abdullah Hamada him it's a chance to find a bargain he's lived here since leaving Iraq in 2015 as tempting as the items on sale are the one thing he can't buy is the right to stay in Germany permanently for three years who now has lobbied the government without success he told me his story they've given me temporary leave to remain here but with that I can't really do anything I have to stay in the refugee home I can't find work because of my status in Germany firms don't want to take on someone in my situation so it's hard for me here that's despite a wealth of documents Hoonah has which show his good level of German clean criminal record and fitness for work but in fact his case is not unique there are more than a hundred and sixty six thousand people who've been denied Asylum but are temporarily allowed to remain that that number conceals an even greater one more than three hundred and fifty three thousand people who are considered to be here illegally with no right to remain and facing deportation some say the issue is not with the federal authorities but with individual German states along CID Agnieska section for deposits the solution is already provided for by the law Parliament has developed several different variations to the law to allow people to get out of temporary status and to legalize their residency here the problem is the individual states are applying these variations in a very restrictive way the new federal interior minister has long argued the current asylum process is unsatisfactory and for faster deportations of those whose applications are rejected you can indeed you can go by the rule of thumb and that's quite logical but the longer a person has been in our country the more time they've had to put down roots and speaking objectively more obstacles can occur either hinderance it varied enough back in Regensburg those are obstacles hunar knows very well nonetheless he says he remains hopeful and the Bavaria feels like his home but for now at least the government does not agree Dominic Kane al-jazeera Regensburg
