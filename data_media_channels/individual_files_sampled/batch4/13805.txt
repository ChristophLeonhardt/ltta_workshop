so FBI director James Comey has now revealed that the 650,000 treasure trove of emails the FBI discovered on Anthony Weiner's laptop doesn't contain any information that would make him rethink his decision not to recommend indictment for Hillary Clinton according to the Washington Post quote the agents work at first seemed endless they had to use special software to sift through 650,000 emails but they accomplished this formidable task and then Comey announced that quote all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State had not changed our conclusions most of the emails but not all reportedly duplicated other emails turned over by Clinton earlier or discovered by the FBI that statement notably did not say that the Clinton Foundation haven't let off the hook it hasn't been new wiki leaks over the email demonstrate further corruption from Hillary sending classified emails to her maid to prince to chelsea allegedly using foundation dollars to sponsor her wedding so Hillary's still corrupt and yes she's still a criminal and according to the Democrats Hillary's back to being innocent and calm he's back to being a saint like wonder dude but the real question is this what in the world was James Comey thinking well in July Comey refused to recommend Clinton for indictment he did so by changing the law itself requiring a level of intent and that simply did not exist in the regulations those regulations demand merely proving a gross negligence it's hard to get more grossly negligent with classified material than setting up a private server in a bathroom and then funneling classified information through it and making it vulnerable to hack in the process or by the way sending that material to your hire janitorial help for printing it's no surprise commis let her off the hook again once you change the standard of the law you'd actually need to find an email from Hillary to Vladimir Putin sending him the names of American spies in order to incite her but here's what actually happened here Comey brushed a letter off then you rush to get himself off then he rushed to let her off again when the polls went south no wonder nobody trusts the FBI now it's a political tool no matter what happens tomorrow Hillary will never be trusted by the American people and nobody will trust James Comey or Loretta Lynch to do justice that means the American people won't give Hillary any sort of bully pulpit or any credibility when she makes her case to the American people maybe perhaps that's the only good news to come from his Horror Show of an election I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so much to get to today here on the Ben Shapiro show it is the day before Election Day so I will give you my election prediction 2016 I'll give you the state-by-state breakdown I'll tell you how I think the popular vote is gonna come down but first we have to say hello to one of our sponsors Bowland branch so I do not sleep well at night because I'm too busy killing terrorists but when I'm not busy killing terrorists I have to sleep and the only way that I can sleep well at night is by is by sleeping in the set of sheets that are actually comfortable after a bowline branch it makes these fantastic sheets there are hundred percent cotton organic cotton they're really really soft they breathe they're really nice luxury sheets can cost up to like a thousand dollars these cost a couple hundred bucks and they are totally totally worth it in fact one of the problems with ball and branch sheets is that once you have a set of ball and branch eats you want to throw out all your other sheets like the well our cleaning lady put it put a new set of sheets on the bed the other day and I immediately strip the sheets off the bed we went back to the Bowlin branch because the sheets are so great I'm actually gonna have to buy a couple more sets of Bolin branch sheets just because they are so comfortable they really are that comfortable they're great apparently three u.s. presidents sleep on ball and branch sheets which means that Hillary Clinton has never slept on Poland branch eats coz bill sleeps on ball and branch sheets in any case if you want these kind of if you want the sheets ball and branch calm promo code Ben is the place to get them Boland branch calm promo code Ben is 50 bucks off your first set of sheets it's like 150 bucks instead of 200 it smelled Bo LL and branch calm and use the promo code Ben get that $50 off and let them know that we set you and and it is that I'm telling you like I'm not fibbing about the quality of these sheets there really are top-notch put those on the helix mattress and they are just spectacular okay so what's going on in the world nate silver who's sort of the elections guru he says the donald trump is relatively close to a path to winning here's what he had to say about Donald Trump's chances on Sunday so we show about a three point lead nationally for Clinton and she's about a two-to-one favorite the electoral college math is actually less solid for Clinton than it was for Obama four years ago were four years ago we had about a a head in states totaling three hundred and twenty some electoral votes Clinton has about 270 s so she's one state away from potentially losing the electoral college you'd rather be in her shoes than down on promise but it's not a terribly safe position give her about a sixty five point seven about yes okay so he says sixty five point seven percent chance of winning and and he says that that Trump does have a path that basically he's one state away from winning this is reflective of the polls over the weekend so basically in order for Trump to win he has to win North Carolina's testament Florida he has to win Ohio he has to win Nevada and then he has to a New Hampshire and if he wins one of the votes in Maine then he takes the election that is his most plausible path to victory in this election cycle which means this sucker could be over early it is possible that this is is over you know very early in the evening if he loses New Hampshire in North Carolina you can kiss this election goodnight it's dunzo it's over turn out the lights four years of Hillary Clinton's Horror Show okay so that's where nate silver puts this election the the democrats either don't seem particularly certain of this election or they're just trying to gin their base to get out by saying it's closer than it is john podesta says that he thinks that hillary can hold michigan she certainly should hold michigan she's up like five or six points in michigan and now we're going to Michigan to New Hampshire to Pennsylvania where they do it the old-fashioned way everybody votes on Election Day we feel like we got a lead in Michigan we want to hold on to it and we think we can do that okay so he says that they're gonna hold on to Michigan and and I think that in all likelihood they will Mike Pence is saying Republicans are coming home this is shown by the statistics Republicans are coming back to trump in the late days of the election because for most people politics ends up being a team sport you're just gonna vote for the person with with the name of the party by their by their name pence makes the case for Trump in the closing hours here we're a hundred percent focused on bringing home a great victory for the American people and Republicans are coming together Chris I was yesterday with Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin a couple days before I was with Governor Doug Ducey in Arizona last night here in Virginia with Ed Gillespie Republicans are coming home and recognizing that we need to elect Donald Trump as a next president reelect a strong Republican majority and Republicans are coming home with independents and Democrats at their side to make sure that that hill Clinton is never elected president of the United States okay so there are a couple of things that are that people aren't questioning about the polls one is they don't know what the turnouts actually going to be like is there the secret base of front voters who are gonna show up out of the woodwork and just vote for Trump I think that's unlikely I do I mean I've yet to meet a closeted Trump supporter they don't really exist as far as I can tell Trump supporters tend to be very loud and very proud about who they're voting for I'm not saying a lot of people even in California who are and this is anecdotal to be sure but now we're talking in the realm of anecdotal because there are no real statistical studies but I really doubt I do doubt there a lot of Trump supporters who are we're not going to are simply lying to pollsters or they're not registering in the polls the other possibility is a lot of the independents are gonna swing the Trump and the polls are not really supporting that idea either so now I'm gonna give you my breakdown of how I think this election is actually gonna go so here's my prediction and you can take it to the bank or not as the case may be here here's where I think this comes down to so in order for Trump to win as I say he has to Anora line of Florida Ohio Iowa and Nevada and then yes win one more state New Hampshire Colorado Virginia Wisconsin Michigan or Pennsylvania all the talk about Minnesota it is gonna happen he's gonna get blown out in Minnesota so let's go through those really quickly North Carolina so far three million ballots have been cast in North Carolina which is a little bit more than we're casting early voting in 2012 is like 2.8 million in 2012 the Hispanic turnout is up a little bit which is good news for Hillary the black turnout is apparently down rather dramatically which is really bad news for Hillary Clinton because she needs the black turnout in order to drive her over the top Nate Cohn of the New York Times estimated as of October 31st he said about 2.9 million people had voted in North Carolina out of the 4.6 million who would eventually vote that's a huge number of people who vote early in North Carolina he says based on the voting history and demographic characteristics of those people we think Hillary leads in North Carolina by about six percentage points that seems real high to me 538 gives Hillary a 50 point six percent shot to beat Trump in North Carolina now I will say Trump doesn't have a ground game so it's possible the polls are off in the in the other direction as well that the Democrats are really gonna get out the vote they're gonna send people to bust people to the polls they're gonna make sure all their elderly voters get out to vote and the turnout game is what decides North Carolina I think that Hillary will end up winning nor Carolina but I do think that'll be very close and I think that Richard Burr who's the senator from North Carolina manned up maintaining his seat he's the Republican in Florida it's also basically a dead heat according to 538 it's essentially a dead heat in Florida between Clinton and Trump there's been some conflicting information about the early voting originally there was a case being made that the early voting was really good for Trump in the last four days the early voting has shifted a little bit more toward Hillary Clinton apparently very very heavy Hispanic turnout in the early voting in Florida apparently some 6.1 million ballots have already been cast in the state of Florida Democrats lead Republicans by just half a percentage points there's a poll out today that shows the people who plan on voting Election Day are going to vote heavily Trump the question is how many of those people there are and how heavily Trump that is so this one is definitely up in the air but if Hispanics vote disproportionately in in Florida and they're not all Cuban Hispanics then it's possible that Trump loses Florida as well I think that he's gonna lose both North Carolina and Florida it's a pessimistic vision for Trump but again he hasn't spent any time building a ground game so I think that's likely Ohio I think Trump will win CNN says that Hillary trails Obama's numbers substantially in the early voting 538 gives him a 65% chance of winning the state that's solid enough for me I will say that Trump wins Ohio I think he's gonna win Iowa as well he's a big in Iowa the latest poll from the Des Moines Register gives him a seven-point lead there in Nevada Clinton is gonna win so before Trump was up pretty big or at least yet he'd drawn into the lead in the last few weeks last 3-4 weeks Hillary has a major advantage in the early voting according to John Ralston who does elections analysis for one of the local news stations in Vegas he says about 770 thousand votes have been cast which is about two-thirds of the entire vote in the state of Nevada and II suppose an election day turnout of 450,000 voters Trump needs to win on Tuesday by 10 points to win this is almost impossible so assume that he loses Nevada and now remember these are all states he needs to win if he loses one of these states he's done he has to win all of these states he cannot afford to lose any of these states unless he's gonna win one of the outliers like Michigan or Pennsylvania we'll get to those in just a second in New Hampshire New Hampshire is apparently really close right now in the latest polling average but you sorta have to look over the last year for the last year New Hampshire by as much as double digits there's about a one-week spate right after the Comey announcement of the renewed FBI investigation or suddenly Trump was ahead by anywhere from one to three points now there are a couple new polls that show Hillary back up I think the Clinton is probably gonna win New Hampshire Colorado Clinton is gonna match Obama's numbers in the early voting that means that she's probably gonna win Colorado Virginia which used to be a Republican state has not voted Republican now probably for the last 12 years the last time they voted Republican was 2004 a lot of the people who live in Washington DC have moved into suburban Virginia and they've been infusing Northern Virginia with his blue feel so Virginia's likely to go for Hillary Clinton Wisconsin polling looks bad for Trump Michigan polling looks bad for Trump he's spending an awful lot of time there you saw Podesta a minute ago saying that he thinks that that Hillary's gonna pull it out I think that she's gonna win by a relatively large margin there Pennsylvania Clinton is expected to win there 538 gives Trump a 23% likelihood of a pickup so I know I'm not gonna give you the rah-rah speech today I'm not gonna lie to you about what's happening here I'm not gonna lie to you the Trump is on the verge of victory I don't think he is I think there's some other people you know who have been suggesting otherwise I know there's a piece by Henry Olsen over at national review where he says the polls aren't taking into account the factors I mentioned before you know the turnout game from Trump the idea of the missing Trump voter who is secretly hiding and just hiding from pollsters in a basement somewhere I don't think that's real my final tally is I think the Trump ends up with 217 electoral votes I think Hillary is over 322 electoral votes which means he went slightly more electoral votes than Romney Ted and and more obviously than McCain said but still gets blown out in pretty handy fashion that's in the electoral college I think in the popular vote he will lose by more than Romney did I think he's gonna win Iowa I think he'll probably win Ohio maybe not but I think that he's more he will certainly win Iowa I don't know if you didn't win Ohio but in any case in the popular vote I think that people are under estimating the level of hatred that Democrats and leftists have for Trump and it's not just because they think he's conservative okay they would have hated Cruz also or Rubio it's because of who Trump is they don't like the stuff that Trump says I think some of that is justified they think Trump is an unpalatable nutjob I think that about a quarter of that is I think unpalatable is right nutjob think is a little bit less charitable but in any case I think that you're going to see heavy turnout in places like New York and California just as a way for for leftists to to virtue signal to their friends that they voted against Trump so I think that the popular vote margin will be larger than Romney even though right now popular vote margin the polls show anywhere from two point nine to three point three points in the spread I think that the final result is going to be something like Hillary Clinton 49 or 50 to Donald Trump 44 I think it'll be a five or six point victory which is a pretty sweeping victory for Hillary Clinton now all of this should make you pretty sad given the fact that we didn't have to nominate this guy you know there's a poll out today that shows what would have happened if we'd nominated for example MIT Romney who I didn't support for the nomination if you had nominated Mitt Romney he would have clobbered for he would have clobbered Clinton 50 to 40 if Obama had run against Trump by the way this is why you can't trust the people who say well look Trump's a better candidate than Romney he's gonna win more electoral votes he's not running against Barack Obama he's running against Hillary Clinton legitimately the worst major Party nominee in the history of American politics except for The Moron we ran so it's just it's devastating if Obama had run against Trump he would've beaten him according to these polls 53 to 41 53 241 which is just devastating so that's how the polls stack up that's how all of this stacks up now I want to go through and we will go through in just a moment sort of the final arguments on both sides because if there's been one thing that's true of this election is that every negative thing that each side says about the other is true everything they say about themselves is a lie and we'll go through that and we'll talk about what impact that has on our politics in just a moment but first we have to say hello to our friends over at Birch gold so if you haven't been if you haven't been looking at the economy lately it looks like it's it's relatively volatile a recession is sort of expected any minute there's a good case to be made that there's a recession in the United States every eight to ten years which means that we're due if there is to be a recession that will probably hit the stock market in the real estate market what it won't hit is gold every time there's a recession the price of gold tends to go up so if you're interested in investing in precious metals as a

be the burn it all down election and in a sense they got exactly what they were looking for everything was burned down some for the good some for the ill for the ill I would say the conservatism has been burned out hollowed out from the inside by a lot of the Trump movement although I think that after this election you will see an attempt to to restore conservatism not of the bush variety but of a new conservative libertarian variety that will have to be a new conservatism but based on constitutional conservative principles and not establishment Arian compromised principles I think that will happen but in the meantime conservatism has been harmed pretty severely by the Trump candidacy that's a bad thing but on the good side the media have just fallen apart so it has now been revealed and this really is amazing that apparently apparently this is according to media ID NC research director Lauren Dylan since a pair of emails to CNN staffers with the hope that they would use to her emails these questions that she wrote for them to ask Donald Trump the first email had the subject line Trump questions for CNN and it says Wolf Blitzer is interviewing Trump on Tuesday ahead of his foreign policy address on Wednesday please send me thoughts by 10:30 a.m. tomorrow this is this is from Lauren Dillon the DNC research director she wrote that to her folks the idea being that she was then I'm gonna funnel those questions over to CNN and they would ask the questions there's another letter that suggested the same thing about Ted Cruz that letter said it was from Dylan to her friend said CNN is looking for questions please send some topical interesting ones maybe a couple on Fiorina someone please take point and send them all together by 3:00 p.m. so in other words the DNC was directly coordinating with people over at CNN to ask questions to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz that is amazing thing the media have destroyed all their credibility that may be the only good thing about this election cycle the Democrats credibility has also destroyed by the way and we'll get to that in just a second as we as we see the Democrats final pitch but to see that you have to go to daily wire
