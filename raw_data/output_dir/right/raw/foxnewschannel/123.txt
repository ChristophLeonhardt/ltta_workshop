A CARAVAN OF IMPOVERISHED

00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:06,122
WILL EVER LEAVE.

41
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:08,158

OUR MEDIA DON'T OFTEN COVER

WELL.

48
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,534
THAT IS WHY THEY KEEP COMING.

49
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,535
THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES

50
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,737
SUGGEST THAT A CARAVAN'S WORTH

51
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:21,971

OUR BORDER EVERY FEW DAYS.

53
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:25,909
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

54
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,576
BECAUSE AN ENTIRE POLITICAL

55
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,545
PARTY IS INVITING IT AND

56
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,712
ENCOURAGING IT.

57
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:30,346
THEY BELIEVE UNCHECKED

58
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:31,314
IMMIGRATION WILL STRENGTHEN

59
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:32,315
THEIR HOLD ON POWER.

60
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:33,316
THEY ARE PERFECTLY AWARE THAT

61
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:34,050
YOU DON'T LIKE THIS, BUT THEY

62
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,685
DON'T CARE.

63
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:38,555
JUST YESTERDAY, NANCY PELOSI

64
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,757
SAID IT WOULD BE "IMMORAL" TO

65
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:41,991
BUILD A WALL THAT WOULD STOP OR

66
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:42,926
PEOPLE FROM PUTTING INTO THIS

67
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:43,726
COUNTRY.

68
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:44,160
WATCH.

69
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:45,461
>> WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING OTHER

70
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:48,331
THAN BUILDING A WALL.

71
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:52,936
WHICH YOU CATEGORIZE VERY WELL.

72
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:53,770
IMMORAL, EXPENSIVE, INEFFECTIVE,

73
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:55,338
AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

74
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,974
PEOPLE DO BETWEEN COUNTRIES.

75
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:59,909
>> Tucker: DID YOU CATCH THAT?

76
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,711
SECURING THE BORDER IS JUST "NOT

77
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:04,547
SOMETHING PEOPLE DO."

78
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:05,815
NOT SOMETHING DECENT PEOPLE DO,

79
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:06,749
ANYWAY.

80
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,984
BIGOTS DO IT, SO DO MORAL

81
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:11,120
REPROBATES AND ANYONE WHO

82
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,322
DERIVES PLEASURE FROM CRUELTY.

83
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:15,325
AS MSNBC EXPLAINS JUST TODAY,

84
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:16,059
BORDERS ARE A LOT LIKE SLAVERY

85
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,061
AND THE TRAIL OF TEARS.

86
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:18,928
WATCH.

87
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:24,367
>> THIS IS A MORAL OUTRAGE, THE

88
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:25,301
WORST EXCESSES IN THE HISTORY OF

89
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:28,137
THE COUNTRY, THE SEPARATION OF

90
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,672
FAMILIES AT THE AUCTION BLOCKS

91
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:30,340
TO THE SEPARATION OF NATIVE

92
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,375
AMERICAN FAMILIES.

93
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:34,911
IT IS A MORAL OUTRAGE.

94
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:36,079
>> I LOVE YOU, I REALLY DO.

95
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,949
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE --

96
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,417
>> Tucker: THEY ARE MORALLY

97
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:41,951
OUTRAGED.

98
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,319
WELL, THEY ARE ALWAYS MORALLY

99
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
OUTRAGE PAIRED THE POINT OF

100
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:46,489
THEIR MORAL OUTRAGE IS VERY

101
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,991
CLEAR, AMERICA HAS NO RIGHT TO

102
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:49,993
DECIDE WHO LIVES WITHIN ITS

103
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:50,927
BORDERS.

104
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:51,728
AMERICANS LACK THE MORAL

105
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,329
STANDING TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

106
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,430
WE ARE TOO SINFUL.

107
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:55,298
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COME HERE

108
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,333
BECAUSE WE DESERVE IT.

109
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,335
WE MEDDLED IN THEIR WARS IN THE

110
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,436
1980s, WE HAVE THE GALL TO GET

111
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:02,905
ADDICTED TO THE DRUGS THEY SEND

112
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:04,173
US, WE ONCE HAD SEGREGATION IN

113
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:04,707
THE AMERICAN SOUTH.

114
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,110
WHATEVER, THE POINT IS THIS IS A

115
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:08,544
FALLEN COUNTRY.

116
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:09,279
22 MILLION ILLEGALS WITHIN OUR

117
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,513
BORDERS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF

118
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,915
OUR PENANCE.

119
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:13,616
LATIN AMERICA IS LISTENING TO

120
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:14,817
ALL OF THIS, AND THEY ARE

121
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:15,718
GETTING THE MESSAGE, THAT IS WHY

122
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,353
THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY.

123
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:20,256
LAST FISCAL YEAR, 94,000

124
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:22,125
FAMILIES FROM HONDURAS,

125
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:22,859
GUATEMALA, AND EL SALVADOR WERE

126
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,527
DETAINED AT THE U.S. BORDER.

127
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:25,261
NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAD A

128
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:27,363
RIGHT TO COMMIT.

129
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,464
BUT THEY WERE NOT DEPORTED.

130
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:31,234
ALMOST 100% OF THEM ARE STILL

131
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:33,736
HERE, AND MOST WILL NEVER LEAVE.

132
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:35,038
WE ARE POWERLESS IN THE FACE OF

133
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,338
THIS.

134
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,307
CONGRESS COULD FIX IT, BUT

135
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,609
CONGRESS REFUSES TO FIX IT.

136
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,944
THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN BY DESIGN.

137
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,913
VOTERS KNOW THIS, OF COURSE, ONE

138
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:44,914
OF THE MAIN REASONS THEY VOTED

139
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:46,749
FOR DONALD TRUMP TWO YEARS AGO.

140
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,718
IF THEY DON'T HATE IMMIGRANTS,

141
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,752
OBVIOUSLY, BUT THEY DO BELIEVE

142
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:50,420
THAT AMERICA HAS A RIGHT TO

143
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:52,355
DECIDE WHICH IMMIGRANTS TO

144
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:52,722
ADMIT.

145
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:53,389
ALL THE COUNTRIES HAVE THAT

146
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,725
RIGHT, DON'T THEY?

147
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:56,759
THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING

148
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,093
DEBATE.

149
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,729
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEIR

150
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,530
LACKEYS IN THE MEDIA DO NOT WANT

151
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,331
TO HAVE THAT DEBATE BECAUSE THEY

152
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:03,099
KNOW THEY WOULD LOSE, SO THEY

153
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,800
TRY TO BELIEVE THE POPULATION

154
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:07,103
INTO SILENCE.

155
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:07,904
>> THE G.O.P. ARGUMENT ON

156
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:10,106
IMMIGRATION ISN'T ONE THAT IS

157
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:10,673
OPTIMISM-BASED, IT IS

158
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:11,074
FEAR-BASED.

159
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:11,674
THIS IS A SCARE TACTIC.

160
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:14,510
THIS IS A PRESIDENT, THIS

161
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:17,213
IMMIGRATION IS A SCARE TACTIC HE

162
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:19,716
IS USING TO WRAP UP HIS

163
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,115
SUPPORTERS.

164
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:21,417
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHITE

165
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:21,951
ANXIETY.

166
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:23,619
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OLD, WHITE

167
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,520
MEN ANGST.

168
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,321
SO WHEN THEY BRING UP THE

169
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,489
CARAVAN, THAT IS ALL WE NEED TO

170
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,523
DO IS BRING UP THE PICTURES OF

171
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:28,257
CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM

172
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:30,760
THEIR FAMILIES.

173
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,029
>> Tucker: IN OTHER WORDS,

174
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,896
SHUT UP RACIST.

175
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:34,897
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THAT

176
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,332
BEFORE, TOO, EVERY DAY FOR THE

177
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,333
LAST FEW YEARS.

178
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,501
YOU HEAR IT A LOT BECAUSE IT IS

179
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:39,502
AN EFFECTIVE POLITICAL TACTIC,

180
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,337
BUT IT ONLY WORKS IF YOU FALL

181
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:42,839
FOR IT.

182
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
YOU SHOULD NOT FALL FOR IT.

183
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,709
MOST AMERICANS ARE NOT RACIST,

184
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,210
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

185
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,312
THEY ARE DECENT PEOPLE.

186
00:04:49,313 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY, THEY
