time's up for the preening hacks who pretend to be journalists on television and in the press times up for the mainstream news media which is decayed to become nothing more than the communications wing of the Democrat Party the real winner of the fake news Awards is you guessed it it's us baby we will analyze the surprising subtlety of this blunt stunt and why it worked so well then flex talks Austin Fletcher and Phillip Wegman join the panel of deplorable z to discuss how and why Democrats sold dreamers down the Rio Grande the looming government shutdown and why PC fanatics think white supremacy is okay last but not least the mailbag I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show I'm wearing a black tuxedo today because time is up I'm so brave I am so courageous RNA but time really is up for the left-wing hacks and the mainstream media and I don't mean it's up in that they'll go away or they'll stop being left-wing hacks or even that they'll stop influencing a lot of people but the time when places like the TV networks the New York Times Washington Post etc when they could pretend to be objective journalists hard-hitting reporters just interested in the facts that actually is over and you have Donald Trump to thank for that after weeks of waiting last night President Trump finally presented the highly anticipated fake news Awards for months now political analysts have wondered what the awards will look like will it be televised will there be a red carpet will people wear black tuxedos and little lapel pins and things like that Trump first announced the awards in November but no one was sure who was kidding or not or if this is a real event he then announced on January 2nd that the awards would be presented on January 8th then on January 7th he announced that the awards would be January 17th and then last night he tweeted the link to a blog post on the GOP website listing eleven news stories that he's already criticized for being fake oh and also the website crashed so the it didn't even load for several minutes the conclusion of months of persistent trolling which really was part of years of trolling the news media going all the way back to the campaign was itself just a troll I loved it so so much that's it that's all it is it's just a blog post it is a barely functional blog post not a speech it not even a tweeted list just a blog post at the GOP website and you know what happened the mainstream media took the bait of course they did now we should be clear this is a non-event this is seriously this is not it didn't even load there was no fake news Awards there was a blog post the mainstream media could have simply ignored this but they couldn't could they no they couldn't because they're empty-headed kittens and this is their catnip who covered it everybody covered it chrissy teigen whom i'd never heard of until last night hosted a fake fake news awards from her snapchat last night newsweek ran the headline quote forget trump fake news Awards former Obama Ethics chief announces president's biggest lie of 2017 the article reads a former Obama administration ethics or is planning to beat Donald Trump at his own game Wednesday trolling him with the golden Pinocchio award for his biggest lie of the year on the night the president is expected to announce his most dishonest and corrupt media awards cool bro really cool you really got him you got him Wow if President Trump had any idea that former Obama ethics are norm Eisen would tweet something then he never would have criticized the mainstream media really good job you Wow you got him The Washington Post fumed quote Trump's fake news awards were a huge flop but guys here's the thing here's the little secret the fact that you're writing about the fake news Awards the fact that we're talking about the fingers worth the fact that there are 1 million 900,000 Google results for the term fake news Awards that means that the fake News Awards did exactly what they were supposed to do how do how do people I actually don't understand how people do not get this how they still don't understand as for the awards themselves CNN won the night taking home four out of the 11 accolades you're shocked I know for those who still haven't seen the blog post or weren't able to load it last night here they are quickly these are the 11 hits former Enron adviser Paul Krugman predicted in the New York Times that markets would never recover from a Trump victory the Dow Jones you'll observe just hit yet another record high ABC News published an entirely fabricated story on Trump Russia collusion sending the stock market tumbling CNN got another story about Trump and Russia entirely wrong Time magazine published a totally fabricated story about President Trump removing the bust of Martin Luther King from The Oval Office wopo lied about Trump's crowd sizes at a rally in Florida CNN lied about Trump overfeeding Japanese pet fish CNN lied about a meeting between Anthony spero Moochie and Russians Newsweek lied about the Polish first lady not shaking president Trump's hand CNN falsely reported that James Comey disputed Trump's claim that he is not under investigation the New York Times published a false story on Trump and global warming than number 11 of course the Russia collusion nothing burger to quote Van Jones there is one last aspect of this that I'd like to point out because nobody has really been covering it the mainstream media aren't the only objects of mockery from this stunt the fake news Awards it mocks the fake news media but it also mocks award shows precisely as we enter award season formerly glamorous celebrities wearing gazillion dollar gowns receiving gold trophies just as the fake news Awards highlight the irrelevance of the mainstream news media their total fall from respectability it does the same for Hollywood which is virtually and literally I'll point out burned to the ground in recent months the fake news Awards worked because both Hollywood and the news media have become ridiculous and Hollywood and the news media have become ridiculous for the same reason they're really the same thing the Hollywood is a bunch of people going on television and pretending to be somebody they're not and the the news media are now a bunch of people going on television pretending to be something they're not it's a bunch of Democrat communications advisers Democrat propagandists pretending to be journalists on television that's all they are they're nothing more than that they've traded both of those Hollywood and mainstream press have traded their original missions which is to entertain on the one hand and to dogged ly pursue the truth on the other for shallow left-wing hackery award shows there are no longer glamorous they're tedious exercises in virtue signaling for millionaires complaining that they deserve even more millions of dollars to pretend for a living the mainstream media no longer respected precisely because formerly journalistic institutions have become nothing more than petty propaganda centers if the press and celebrity reactions to last night are any indication yesterday's fake news awards will be the first of many because they still refuse to see white everyone is laughing at them alright let's bring on our panel so we've got a great panel with us today we have flex talks Austin Fletcher from flex talks you've seen his YouTube channel and Phillip Wegman from the Washington Examiner Phil if you look okay but I got to tell you Fleck is wearing that Jersey tank top you look phenomenal sir we got to get right into the news we don't have any more time to talk about fake news we got to talk about real news Democrats have sold the dreamers down the Rio Grande after a apparently productive meeting on immigration open to the press we all saw it dick Durbin alleged that Donald Trump called Haiti a not very nice place to live so Durban in doing that poisoned any possibility of Dhaka compromise why did he do it I don't know Phillip did dick Durban just realized that it's better for Democrats electoral chances to keep calling Trump a racist and if that means that younger children totally right I agree with that analysis entirely flicka's Austin this seems to me final irrefutable proof as I've said for many years that Democrats do not give a damn about illegal aliens at all they just want to win elections they only pretend to care about illegal aliens when it suits their electoral needs should the GOP finally talk bluntly about that cut it out with all of the rhetoric about compassion and humanity and these poor people and dreamers and all the other things that we now know Democrats do not care about at all should we speak bluntly yeah I absolutely agree I think it's about time that we did because realistically the dead rats have always been appealing to the left you know sense of morality and bigger picture I think the left especially the uninformed left that I come in contact with it all these protests they think they can solve global poverty with immigrations they think oh the dreamers oh like they came here young they're not familiar with the country they came from they just want a better opportunity and that's the narrative that's the narrative that's the narrative and then when it actually comes time to make something happen they self-sabotage and would rather shut down the government just to you know have a better chance in 2018 so I mean I don't I never I thought we did negotiate with terrorists and now the Democrats there seem to be you know getting time with us and our negotiations and it's not good and they do it was so offensive about it is there are so many awful costs of illegal immigration something like 40% of young women who cross the border and girls who cross the border illegally or raped these people are forced to live in the shadows they can't access a lot of services obviously there's the flip side of that which is the illegal immigrant crime and gang membership such as ms-13 and there are all these really awful vicious aspects to it for both the illegal aliens and for the American citizens and yet they couch it in this language of oh well we're the ones who care about these people we're the only moral ones and then you find out when push comes to shove they don't give a damn about these people they're perfectly willing to let them be deported or let the let there be some stopgap measure for them because for them what it's all about is getting votes and and specifically if they can rely on 80 percent of votes if amnesty goes through and these people tend to trend Democrat then they'll do it for that but if the illegal aliens we're going to vote for Republicans they would be the first people loading up the the deportation trains so it's really frustrating and I hope that in this era of Donald Trump speaking bluntly and taking away a lot of that nonsense PC political talk we can speak honestly about this and say look Democrats you're dirty rotten cynics who are using these poor people as political cuddles and his little pawns and we're not going to take it anymore and as long as they signed the pledge the the Michael Knowles show dreamer daca compromised pledge which is that they all get amnesty immediately as well as they agree to vote for Republicans for 25 consecutive elections then that's fine then we can form a deal and these people get to stay I hope I hope the Senate takes up my my suggestion moving on to the government shutdown itself the White House today has signaled that it will sign a one-month stopgap measure to fund the government until a longer military funding deal and budget deal is reached flex this seems to me like the win-win reality of Trump either he's competent and get gets good things done or he's incompetent and the government governs less either way that's cool with me should Republicans fear a shutdown in this case hope there isn't a shutdown just because of that you know we need to keep paying the military and if the left is going to have this you know quid pro quo type thing where you know amnesty for all we're shutting it down that's not how this should go and just to touch on the last point you made about the adopted people the dreamers coming over and you know they were left wanting their votes the people I come in contact with the protests who are Lee know a lot of people are Latinos for Trump a lot of these people came here illegally because they respect the country and love the country so much and I mean they that's why they tend to vote Republican oh so adding to your last point like the people who are coming here illegally it makes perfect sense that you know the Democrats want to help them as much as they can cuz that's potential Democratic voters who aren't really you know American first ever well that's their basis criminals but you're you're so right of course we should have known that these people would trend to vote Democrat they're criminals and that's a key aspect of the left-wing coalition good point Phillip is the white house breaking ranks with Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans who have ooh they themselves have signaled that they oppose the stopgap measure or is there some strategy that I'm missing here when it comes to conversations between McConnell Ryan and Trump that's definitely in flux and it's keeping Democrats on their chose one thing I don't think the Democrats should be so quick to make that hold on conclusion that somehow they're gonna benefit because of a shutdown yes Trump keeps changing his mind and I would die at immigration but he has made some pretty significant overtures when it comes to flexibility so I think that you know if you're talking about that Latino vote or that dreamer they're going to see that in this CR deal Trump just as asking for a continuation of government funding and asking and we're not able to get young people who are looking for during war legislation to come through see through this time yeah I I think you're right especially if we keep hammering them in this way if we keep using blunt language and now that their chief communications wing has cracked as we saw last night in the fake news Awards I think there's a real chance in the old days the fear was even if we're right on the facts we're gonna be so blown out by the press that it doesn't really matter and we just have to play by their rules I don't think that's true anymore it's largely not true anymore so let's cross our fingers during 2016 a bunch of Trump supporters started using the okay symbol and 4chan decided to troll people into thinking that the okay sign was a white supremacist symbol so the son of New Jersey's Democrat governor Phil Murphy played this game he did a little circle sign during his father's swearing-in and so the okay sign has many innocuous connotations obviously there's nothing inherently racist about saying hey okay everything's good and there's also this childhood game whereby you make someone look at the little okay sign and then if they look at it you punch them like they did on Malcolm in the middle you might remember this jerk you looked Wow yeah so I used to do that as a kid it's free fun and so anyway 4chan decided to make this a symbol of their support for Trump or something and Media Matters immediately pounced on this so now the New Jersey press are calling this kid racist flex is okay white supremacists I'm not asking by the way if white supremacy is okay that is a subtle distinction is the okay sign or we can't use that anymore it's news to me but yeah I mean leave it to the left to ruin everything with Pepe the Frog the Pepe the Frog was a good meme a popular meme on 4chan and reddit and then someone made I think a Nazi version of it and now everyone who's ever used a Pepe the Frog name is a Nazi and it's just leave it to the left to ruin everything they've already ruined Hollywood they've been ruined every you know city that they run I just saw a L'Oreal commercial I came out today for a shampoo and the woman in the commercial was wearing a hijab you're kidding me that can't be true it's true that is unbelie and that's the problem we are now beyond parody where even the okay symbol has become this Nazi thing or this white supremacist thing Philip you know admitted and avowed racists like Richard Spencer they now use the symbol but it seems to me like it's ironic it seems to me fortune is trolling PC culture where any even the most innocuous of symbols could be deemed offensive and the PC culture totally took the bait so can we can we use it or not is someone are they gonna take a picture of this screenshot of me doing the symbol and now I became a Nazi is that what's going to happen I think surely comes along and starts using this as a racism but they actually the old right in there being jerks about this kind of underscore the same point for the mainstream media which is that they don't get to tell me what totally innocuous widespread symbols mean the mainstream media doesn't get to redefine the okay sign or what's the next the thumbs up or something and likewise Richard Spencer doesn't get to do that there are like 50 of these people in the entire world who are actually white to nationalists who wanted to pour it all the black people and they don't get to define widespread symbols for me they they can I've got two words for those people the mainstream media and the alright and those words are not happy birthday okay that's all the time we have panel thank you for being here now it is time we have to get to the mailbag that is philip Wegman from the Washington Examiner and flex talks go check them out on YouTube before we get to the mailbag I'm sorry Marshall he's cutting me off is I'm hearing they're it's like they're playing me off like it all the other awards shows times up for me so if you're on Facebook and YouTube you have to go over to Daley we're calm right now if you're on Daley wire calm thank you you helped keep the lights on you keep Coffey in my cup we really appreciate it what do you get if you join the daily wire well you get me you get the and reclaim and sure you get the Ben Shapiro show it's ten bucks a month or 100 dollars a year you get no ads on the website you get to ask questions the mailbag you have to ask questions on the conversation by the way the next version of the conversation is gonna be me so get ready for that and ask your questions but who cares no one really cares about any of that stuff what we really care about is this and and the this the leftist here's tumblr we now have a really wonderful vintage you have got to get this there the cory booker leftist tears and I didn't know you never can quite tell when a vintage batch is going to come up but it's 2018 and it's all thanks to Cory Booker so make sure that you have the the right vessel because it would be such a shame if you collected all of Cory Booker's salty delicious and ridiculous tears and then they went bad and then went bad you couldn't drink them ten years or 15 years that would be so it would be a real shame in a real waste make sure you store them properly in the leftist here's tumblr you can keep it in a nice dry area and it will maintain the perfect salty ratio so you could gobble up all of Cory Booker's absurd performance the other day okay go to daily we're calm we'll be right back with the mailbag the first question comes from clay Kasasa there's a good Sicilian cake called Cassata but that's clay Kasasa a voice of another Kingdom Knolls i've loved movies since I was a kid and have started to write screenplays on final draft as a sort of creative hobby I have no delusions about getting into Hollywood on spec scripts but I would like to make them good enough to submit to contests and see how they do I've enjoyed the throwback to old radio of another Kingdom and I'm wondering if that would be a legitimate way to get my stories to the masses I'm wary of the artistic trope of starting and stopping and never finishing projects would you recommend finishing in the screenplay format we're immediately shifting to scripting for podcasts thanks clay I think that you should immediately start going into podcasts or whatever medium you can control to get your stories out there I say this for a few reasons you brought up the question of contests you have to ask yourself what are you doing this artistic endeavor for if you're doing it just to amuse yourself and see if you have any talent and you know maybe some judge will tell you that you did a good job then submit it to contests that's that's what that is good for and maybe they'll write you a note and say this was good and actually if you want to work on your craft and get decent feedback I suppose that's one way to do it if you are ready to release this material to an audience and you have a clear artistic vision and you just want people to see it don't waste your time those things go nowhere the odds of them working out or very low if you watch this show you probably are slightly on the right or at least you're right curious and that's gonna kill you in Hollywood it's really going to hurt you so I wouldn't do that I would it's just about getting the work out there if there are a few screenwriters and novelists who are more successful than andrew Clavin and we've been called in for meetings on another kingdom - with TV producers and people all around 10:00 very big names then they google andrew Clavin the night before and the meetings are icy cold and and another Kingdom has I think seventeen or eighteen hundred five-star reviews it's got a gazillion downloads and don't waste your time on it get the message out there you know that trick of Hollywood you go into any coffee shop and there were five million people writing screenplays on their laptops and not it not a one of them is going to get them made or very very very few of them for so could do what you can to control your own distribution and you get an audience and and that will that will tell you if it's good or not and it will tell you if you have a future in it hopefully if you want to work on your craft work with an editor maybe submit it to contests but if you want people to see it do it yourself from Gareth mr. Knowles when is your book coming out an audiobook version it's good it's like John Cage I heard it was quite the read a second how do you respond to the opinion that morality is an evolutionarily derived trait which our ancestors used to cooperate with one another so that the race survived how do we know the morality that really what you're asking is how do we know the morality is real and it's not just some evolutionary tick that you know who cares what it is we've just developed it for some reason what this means what you're suggesting by this evolutionary development evolutionary morality is that there is no good or bad there is no right or wrong Hamlet talks about this because if there isn't a morality if there isn't an objective morality which human beings are sensing or intuiting or reasoning their way towards something if there isn't a standard outside of our own little brains then nothing really is right or wrong and murdering and raping and pillaging that isn't really wrong it's just not evolutionarily advantageous to certain groups so therefore I guess we shouldn't do it but it doesn't really matter it's just not advantageous blah blah blah Hamlet talks about this when he's talking to res of Grants and Guildenstern he he says there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so that's this is this exact thesis and what you should know about that is that Hamlet is pretending to be insane when he says that that isn't Hamlet's actual outlook it isn't Shakespeare's outlook it's Hamlet pretending to be mad too Rosencrantz and Guildenstern so the other aspect of this of evolutionary morality is it's totally unfalsifiable so you know we'll say okay why have I evolved too if I see a bus coming and there's a young woman in the way why do i why would I risk my life and maybe give up my life to push her out of the way I guess there's an evolutionary advantage to that two groups because then she can pass on her genes hopefully she can pass along with me you know that might be the other psychological advantage by natural selection but why when I see an old woman about to be hit by a bus do I also have the impulse to give up my life to push her out of the way why do I have the the reasonable understanding that it it would be valiant and gallant and courageous for me to push her out of the way even if it gives up my own life why is that a moral good there's no evolutionary expectation explanation for that she can't have more children presumably and the way that these people who advance this hypothesis explain that away as they say oh that's just a secondary trait that's just yeah there was a reason for that in your psychology in the way that evolution has made you but that is just a quirk from some other reason for the for the young woman or something it just doesn't make a lot of sense and nobody behaves as the morality very few people behave as their morality is not real as if there is no nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so a lot of people say that that's true but they don't behave that way because we all know that that isn't true it doesn't make sense it ends up undercutting its own arguments and so whereas there there may be many evolutionary explanations to a lot of things if there isn't that outside of ourselves if there isn't logic and reason and ideas and morality moral standards outside of ourselves then we're all just babbling nonsense and nothing that we're saying makes any sense and you can't rely on your own faculties of Reason to get along in the world but until until we start doing that and we fully decay into just apes grunting of one another then then I don't think anyone is really taking that seriously from Noah hi Sir Michael Knowles you are my favorite guy in the news media love your show thank you very much it's very nice I grew up in the Foursquare Church raised by my grandparents who are missionaries to Malaysia and I hold no and they hold no sympathies for the Catholic Church or I hold no sin I don't know either you or your grandparents gonna hold sympathies I believe your argument that God having come to earth through a particular woman in a particular place and at a particular time should have a particular church is flawed Jesus chose 12 disciples to build his Church twelve men from every walk of life and every Creed men who on the day of Pentecost were surrounded by people of every nation in every tongue in other words Jesus our Lord and Savior chose nobody in particular to build his church here on earth Michael please tell me why I should be a Catholic or forever hold your peace a few points just to begin one the purpose of this show is not to convert everybody to Catholicism so that might be a secondary trade that might be a secondary effect of it but and just there is one inaccuracy who said that they came from every Creed they didn't come from every Creed but part of that all of the earth coming to Christ is seen in that the story of the Magi that they are supposed to have come from Persia from other religions other places often they're represented as being one of each race but even your statement itself Christ chose nobody that is clearly not true Christ chose those people so he so he didn't choose nobody because they weren't nobody all of what you said is true if Christianity were a fable or a philosophy that could stop there but Christianity isn't a fable or a philosophy it's a fact it's not it doesn't begin in poetry it doesn't begin in mythology it begins in a thing that actually happened the birth of this guy the life of this person that really happened it wasn't just cooked up in a writers room somewhere in Hollywood it really happened Christianity is the greatest story ever told but it isn't fiction and you are in the story so yes Peter Paul Matthew Judas they all represent many things they are symbols but they're symbols created by God who lived on earth in space and time and so are you you're in the story you are in the story but you're also a real person the crucifixion and the resurrection and the feeding of the 5,000 and the woman at the well and the walking on water they all have tremendous symbolic and explanatory power they also really happened same goes for you your relationship to God is the relationship of Hamlet to shake it of Hamlet - Shakespeare rather in Christ the playwright enters into his own story you cannot abstract yourself from the story of reality you can't get above it all you cannot lift yourself above it all you are in it Christ's Church is universal that's what the word Catholic means means universal it's also a real thing in time and space with real people someday we will slip the surly bonds of Earth and throw off this flesh but we aren't there yet Christ speaks forever about the importance of time my time has not yet come the fullness of time he speaks of the bread being literally his body and he knows that this is a hard saying and he says this is a hard saying and the apostles can't stomach it Christ knows this and as tempting as it is to skip ahead to deny the dramatic tension of our lives in time and space of the limits of human nature we shouldn't do that there is a purpose there's a time for every purpose under heaven there's a time in a space for every purpose under heaven this is a real quirk of the modern era of modernity there's a reason that it coincided with the Protestant revolution and all that has come after that it's a quirk of modernity to want to abstract ourselves to pretend that we are not in fleshed that we are not in space and time that the acts of value are not in fleshed I think a lot of times people would rather it be the ideas of the Apostles rather than the Acts of the Apostles they would rather they would rather pretend that Christianity is just a fable it's a fable by which we can live our lives but it isn't a fable it really happened that's what makes it so real that's what makes the intersection of heaven and earth of metaphysics and physics in Christ so powerfully compelling it's why it's the greatest story ever told is because it's true it's nonfiction and you should live as though it's nonfiction as though these things happened and there is consequence to what you do in time and space in relations to people next question from Mark Levin mm-hmm dear swarthy estat The Daily wire mr. Michael J Knowles I am a recent economics graduate and have realized that I would love to turn my obsession with politics into a career what's the best way to get started as I'm in the New York metro area where it seems like the only available work is with progressive read socialist outlets all the best Mark Levin yes that is really my name can i leverage that okay my first advice to you you're an economics major is make a lot of money don't go right into politics make a lot of money go and do something make a lot of money it to get you into politics do that I'm from New York and yes it's very hard there are some Republican candidates there though I still regularly advise candidates in the New York metro area on running for office and under campaigns so there is that it's a little bit of a boutique industry because a lot of times Republicans don't win but I've been on plenty of winning campaigns in New York the reason you should make a lot of money right now is so that you don't need politics all the great politicians in history haven't really needed it they haven't needed to get reelected and therefore they don't have to compromise themselves and therefore they actually achieve really good things it's also it will just make you more of a person if you spend your whole life working as a staffer in politics or as a I don't know as an elected official or something it really does wear away I think at you and it's good to just have bring a life experience to politics so you know I would yesterday I had to miss the show because I was doing a film shoot very rarely I still am an actor in Hollywood and I still get cast I called up my semiannual acting and it's it really brings a lot to my life to have something outside of politics obviously it's been most of my life with my head in politics I spend most of my life not writing political books but it's good to have things outside of that too and I think it will just it'll make you a better a politician or a better political analyst or whatever you want to do in politics if you bring something outside of it that said you wouldn't win any race you want if your name is Mark Levin and you move to the right district that is how things work especially down ballot if you run for Congress or lower or certainly state representative or state Senate you will win if it's a Republican district and your name is Mark Levin because people don't care about those races and inevitably Mark Levin has 100% name recognition among Republicans and you have his name and it'll just help you out so make a lot of money but do it fast while Mark is still famous and important mmm run for Congress or something you'll almost certainly win unless you run in New York so you got to move to okay next question from safe dear Michael king of trolls and champion of deplorable z I often hear conservatives discuss the fact that our country was founded on judeo-christian values but I was wondering what texts or writings support this claim I want to be able to better defend this claim when I make it to my liberal colleagues thanks for all the work you do for all of us deplorable Zout here Seth okay so what do we mean by judeo-christian values the those are those are the values that come through Christianity into the secular and modern world ideas we get natural law and natural rights and all of that from why are they called judeo-christian well because Christ was a Jew Christ is the Messiah from the Jewish people to all the nations of the world and all of the people who founded this country were Christian do you I have a dear old Samuel fuller dr. fuller my great-grandfather from the Mayflower he certainly believed that the country was founded up in Plymouth centuries before the Declaration of Independence was signed by very serious Christian religious zealots to be a shining city on a hill then if you read if you want founding documents to read read the Declaration of Independence in the Constitution of the United States it clearly the Declaration clearly states we were endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights including life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that that alone is Christian how do we know it's Christian because all of those people were Christian it is true that some were more deistic and a little less more abstract in their christianity but we know the country was founded as early as 1620 by Christians it was Christians who populated the place so that that culture is the politics is inseparable from that culture on the one hand it is stated very clearly this is a constitution built for moral people and it can demand religious people and it couldn't survive beyond a moral and a religious people we also know all of them beginning in the 17th century I had these ideas and had this culture in that culture stood in the United States and it created this country so if you want to trace it back I would trace the founding further back than 1776 but look at the evolution this wasn't founded by a Muslim people for instance this wasn't founded by Buddhist people wasn't founded by Hindu people and the people who did that grew in a culture and had their vision of the world formed by that by Christianity which is the animating force of the West the the meeting between Athens and Jerusalem which it gave us all of all of the Western civilization from Marcus I Michael I think this is possibly the most outrageous aspect of this is these story it's that they didn't finish their wine which probably cost them sixty seven dollars for the bottle considering how expensive the restaurant is and how much the wine must cost would you ever leave a restaurant with wine still in your glass and still in your bottle I would never leave anywhere with wine still in my glass and still in my bottle that is a universal rule that is true at all places in all times really what a decadent culture that this guy's got money to burn any leaves booze sitting around a good Sicilian boy would never do that it's actually considered a bad luck to leave wine on the table among a lot of different Italian regions and that I think they're probably just explaining their own behavior from Andy was it accidental that today you used the word indiscernible when you clearly meant indistinguishable sorry I know all this all the world loves a smart-arse but it made me wince I guess I had said this about the sexes that they were indiscernible I actually did mean indiscernible because I was alluding to a specific philosophical principle an ontological principle called the indiscernible 'ti of identicals that there cannot be separate objects or identities that have all of their properties in common this is also called live missus law after the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz so that this issue with with the genders is that people want to say that men there are men and there are women where there's feminism and yet men and women are exactly the same there indiscernible there are there I you couldn't tell the difference because they're identical but if men and women are exactly the same then there's no such thing as women because there there are into different categories if men and women are exactly the same then there are only men and this is a minor example of all of feminism which very often just hurts women because as Andrew Klavan says it makes them take on male values but the Descartes actually uses this same point of the indiscernible 'ti of identicals to prove that he is different from his own body so it's kind of fun too I don't know that I totally buy it but it's very fun to look at that but that's what I was alluding to it's why I used that word when I discuss this issue is because if you think about it even two steps down the road into liveness is law then most many of the claims made by feminists appear totally ridiculous from Samuel dear Michael as Catholics we're supposed to find spiritual strength and comfort in the sacraments and in prayer what happens when such resources seem to do nothing for us I've reached a period of my life where I do not think that I have a close relationship with God that is necessary to live an ethical and happy life what should I do when Mass Eucharist reconciliation and prayer seem to have no positive effects on me blessings in Christ this is gonna sound blunt and mean but it's just a little tough love please don't take it I don't mean it in any mean way stop thinking about yourself stop it a man wrapped up in himself as a very small package indeed the sacraments aren't there so that you can feel really nice about yourself or so that you can feel comforted I quote it frequently but it deserves quoting again see as Lewis said if you look for truth you might find comfort if you look for comfort you won't find neither truth nor comfort only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin and in the end despair the sacraments are there for the unity of heaven and earth and physics and metaphysics and for you to touch God that's what Christ comes into being to reconcile man to God and to redeem him there's a gratitude there which if you just think about it a little bit that you couldn't deny that gratitude now of course not every time you go to Mass are you going to be enraptured and having a numinous experience that won't happen it didn't happen to the Virgin Mary the angel Gabriel came down to Mary appeared to Mary said God Himself will be conceived within you then he went away and she went on with her life and she it's not like every moment was this total rapturous moment so you you partake in the sacraments because they bring you closer to God but you'll have periods of doubt and a a very subtle thing that begins to happen is once that emotional loveliness goes away or it's not there every time then you might question God himself you shouldn't do that that's your faith being founded in a place where it shouldn't be are being placed where it shouldn't be but you see this a number of more charismatic Protestant movements it's all about the feelings and you know the emotion of it and the acoustic guitars of waving your hands in the air but that isn't there forever there's nowhere in the bible does it show that that occurs all of the time you know God speaks to Jacob at certain times and certainly he speaks to Abraham at certain times when they're not just hanging out all the time so I look outside of yourself I don't mean this is a criticism specifically of you I do it all the time - but look outside of yourself look toward God and I think it'll get you out of your own ahead and stop wondering why you aren't so happy all the time this is why if just a little bit of a side note whenever people at the holidays like New Year's Eve of Valentine's Day they very often have a bad time because you build these things up in your head and yet it has to be perfect and I have to be enjoying myself all the time I have to be really happy all the time and why aren't I happy why can't this be and you get miserable the holidays are miserable for a lot of people that doesn't stop worrying about why you aren't happy stop worrying about why you aren't having pleasure and everything why you aren't feeling the thing you think you're supposed to be feeling there's nothing you're supposed to be feeling you're just doing the thing you're doing it you're in communion with God that's good enough that's good enough even if you weren't of feeling that chill and emotional a jolt of it at every single time good luck god bless from Michael is there ever an instance where government regulation can fuel competition in the market I think specifically at the airline industry which some claim is an oligopoly that promotes a mirage of choice and the illusion of competition competent more competition is better that's a virtually always true and the example of you site actually proves it it I travel on airplanes a fair bit and it's well cliche to complain about air travel because in many ways it is degrading they give you I think six square inches of space for you to sit in on the plane I'm not a terribly gigantic guy but I'm like you know obviously I'm three different people's laps in the new way that airlines are laid out but that said deregulation of the airlines was a massive massive success particularly for the consumer the airline deregulation Act of 1978 freed up the airlines and really broke up a lot of the legacy airlines but the prices dropped tremendously prices dropped $1400 or I'm sorry a price has dropped 40% since the government set the prices and controlled the airlines and their economists estimate that today the cheapest flight possible from LA to New York would be $1400 if not for deregulation I can get a round-trip from LA to New York sometimes for a couple hundred bucks now what does that mean it means that the things aren't as spacious anymore the waiting rooms aren't as spacious they don't serve you prime rib when you're on the plane that's because more people are using them it's much more efficient there are some airlines that make you pay for water good I'm glad I want to pay for water I don't want to be subsidizing that guy over there his water I want to have as much consumer choice as I possibly can now you have to pay an upgrade fee if you want to get like economy- plus 7 you know I don't know you get an exit row you have to pay more for good I want it because that means that when I'm a cheapskate and I just want my quick flight back from New York or wherever I want to get the cheapest thing I can and I'll go into my cocoon and sleep I was caught in the UK and a wedding and I threw a mistake of the travel agent and of me I might return ticket wasn't valid and I got stuck in the UK I had to come back here to do the show and the flight was 15 hours away I had to buy a new flight direct you London Heathrow to Los Angeles with 15 hours before the flight most of the flights were thousands of dollars but a cheapo airline had one for 600 bucks that I was able to buy because of all of the competition in the airlines and it was a miserable flying experience and I got to save a lot of money that is really good whenever you see people complaining because of these things it's easy to get lulled into how nice and luxurious a lot of accommodations are these days don't forget how bad it could be don't forget what will happen when they go if the government comes in and starts heavily reregulate his airlines you're going to go back to before 19 and yes they might have served the prime rib but you paid a lot more money and it's something and the reason those those lounges and those airlines weren't full is because nobody could afford to fly so more competition bring it on and if you want a nicer seat pay a little bit more money okay that's our show we will be we'll have a show tomorrow Friday show
