00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,443
EVIDENCE OF AN ANTI-TRUMP DEEP

00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,311
STATE?

15
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:30,513
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM UTAH

00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:33,049
COMMITTEE.

18
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:37,454
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

19
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,389
ONE OF YOUR COUNTERPARTS ACROSS

20
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:43,293
THE AISLE, ADAM SCHIFF SAYS "NO

21
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,829
DEEP STATE, NO SECRET SOCIETY,

22
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,198
NO ANTI-TRUMP CABAL AT THE FBI.

23
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,268
NO INDICATION THAT COMEY'S

24
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:53,670
ERRORS OF JUDGMENT DID ANYTHING

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,438
BUT HELP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

26
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,675
NO VINDICATION FOR THE PRESENT.

27
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,143
>> ALL, MY GOSH.

28
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,480
HAS HE BEEN LIVING ON MARS?

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,316
NOTHING'S GOING ON HERE.

30
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,617
I THINK MR. McCARTHY EARLIER

31
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:10,653
SAID IT WELL.

32
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,723
YOU CAN'T HAVE THESE EXAMPLES OF

33
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,258
THE ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THIS

34
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:16,893
PRESIDENT AND THE VISCERAL

35
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:17,694
HATRED TOWARD THIS PRESIDENT

36
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:20,096
DEMONSTRATED WITH SOME OF THESE

37
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:21,197
FBI, SENIOR FBI OFFICIALS AND

38
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,166
THEN JUST PRESUME THAT NONE OF

39
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,234
THAT WAS MANIFESTED IN THEIR

40
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:27,103
WORK ARE IN THE WAY THAT THEY

41
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:27,770
VIEWED THEIR DIFFERENT CASES

42
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,872
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOME OF THESE

43
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:30,073
INDIVIDUALS ARE WORKING ON

44
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,708
HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAIL THING AT

45
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,009
THE SAME TIME THEY ARE WORKING

46
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,378
ON THE DONALD TRUMP RUSSIA

47
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:36,679
INVESTIGATION.

48
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,881
IT'S A STRETCH TO IMAGINE THOSE

49
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,549
PERSONAL FEELINGS WOULDN'T

50
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,984
INFLUENCE THEIR WORK AT SOME

51
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:41,517
POINT.

52
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:42,118
>> Shannon: ALL RIGHT.

53
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,720
PETER STRZOK'S ATTORNEY, HE

54
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,489
FIGURES PROMINENTLY IN THIS

55
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,724
REPORT, HE SAID "THE IG CONCLUDE

56
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,158
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE

00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:51,694
POLITICAL VIEWS OF SPECIAL

58
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,796
AGENTS STRZOK AND OTHERS

59
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:55,465
IMPACTED THE HANDLING OF THE

60
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,733
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION."

61
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:57,667
THAT IS REPEATED THERE WITH

62
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,570
GENERAL SIZE THROUGHOUT THE 568

63
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,673
PAGES HERE BUT YOU ARE SAYING

64
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:04,240
COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU

65
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,707
OTHERWISE?

66
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,576
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW HE COULD

67
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:08,377
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT LESSIE CAN

68
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:09,878
CRAWL INSIDE YOUR MIND AND

69
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:10,479
ACTUALLY EXAMINE THEIR

70
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,681
MENTAL PROCESS.

71
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,082
I WANT TO COMPLEMENT THE

72
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:13,783
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR WHAT I

73
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:15,318
THINK IS GENERALLY A VERY

74
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:16,085
THOROUGH WORK.

75
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,120
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN

76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,887
LOOKING FORWARD TO.

77
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,921
HE'S BROUGHT FORTH INFORMATION

78
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,857
THAT THOSE OF US ON THE INTEL

79
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:21,624
COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN BEATING OUR

80
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,959
HEADS AGAINST THE WALL TRYING TO

81
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,963
GET FROM THE FBI.

82
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:27,597
WE ARE GLAD HE'S DONE IT.

83
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,866
SOME OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

84
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,667
I'M JUST GOING TO AGREE TO

85
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,468
DISAGREE ON THIS.

86
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,402
HE CAN PRESUME WHETHER IT

87
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:35,204
IMPACTED THE OUTCOME OF THEIR

88
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:38,875
WORK WHEN IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY

89
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,242
UNLIKELY.

90
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,144
THIS IS FROM SOMEONE WHO

91
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:42,812
DEFENDED DIRECTOR COMEY FOR

92
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,914
MANY, MANY YEARS.

93
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,982
IT SHOWS THE OBVIOUS LACK OF

94
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:46,382
LEADERSHIP.

95
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,517
HOW IS IT THAT THE VERY SENIOR

96
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:49,518
PEOPLE AROUND THE FBI, AND WE

97
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:50,386
NOW KNOW THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY

98
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:53,289
POLITICAL HACKS.

99
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:53,923
LIBERAL POLITICAL HACKS.

100
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,026
IT ISN'T JUST A COINCIDENCE.

101
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:59,795
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CALLING

102
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:00,730
HIS INSUBORDINATION AND POINTING

103
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,666
OUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS

104
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,767
INVESTIGATING HILLARY CLINTON,

105
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,901
DOING THE SAME THING.

106
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:08,871
THE NUMBER OF LEAKS IN THE MEDIA

107
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:09,872
CONTACTS THAT SENIOR FBI

108
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:11,073
OFFICIALS HAD NO BUSINESS

109
00:03:11,073 --> 00:03:12,675
TALKING TO THE MEDIA.

110
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:13,976
ACCEPTING GIFTS FROM THE MEDIA

111
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:14,877
REPRESENTATIVES.

112
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,712
THE CULTURE IN THE FA UNDER THAT

113
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,014
LEADERSHIP ABSOLUTELY HAD TO

114
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:18,347
CHANGE.

115
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:21,083
>> Shannon: DIRECTOR WRAY SAYS

116
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,284
IT HAS IN IT WELL AND HE WILL

117
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:22,885
PUSH FORWARD.

118
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,086
QUICKLY, THE ONE QUESTION YOU

119
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:25,921
WANT ANSWER BECAUSE THE

120
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:26,622
INSPECTOR GENERAL VIEW BEFORE

121

THE SENATE AND HOUSE NEXT WEEK.

122
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,059
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY ONE

123
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,795
BOAT QUICKLY, IT WOULD BE, DID

125
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,166
DID YOU FEEL PRESSURE TO

126
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:37,867
CHANGE A REPORT?

127
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:41,003
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE EVIDENCE

128
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:41,504
QUESTION.

129
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,639
I WOULD LOVE FOR HIM TO CONTINUE

130
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,106
THIS WORK.

131
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:46,475
HE CAN'T BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR

132
00:03:46,475 --> 00:00:00,000
HIM TO CONTINUE HIS WORK.
