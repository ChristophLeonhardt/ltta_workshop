we don't need a wall El Paso this town that I was born and raised in where Amy and I are raising Ulysses and Molly and Henry happens to be one of if not the safest cities in the United States of America and what makes us so safe is that we are a city of immigrants and we treat one another with respect and dignity I think that's fundamental to security do you do you want to see the dreamers protected absolutely Schumer was willing to trade President Trump the wall for the DREAM Act would you take that deal no I wouldn't from Texas town halls the late-night talk shows the Democratic candidate for Senate in Texas Beto O'Rourke is spreading his message of unity and acceptance for works opponent senator Ted Cruz is worried as polls show and narrowing margin between the two candidates appoint Stephen Colbert made last night before he interviewed the Democratic candidate earlier the summer in order to save the Cruz campaign Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick showed up in Washington to deliver an urgent plea to White House officials send President Donald Trump you know it's bad we need backup from a man with a 36 percent approval rating here's how scared Ted Cruz is of better O'Rourke he bought ads on my show tonight to counter his interview Patrick's vtec political reporter for The Texas Tribune thank you for being with us we've been talking about Beto we'vewe've the moments that have gone viral have certainly captured our imaginations but we thought it was time for some ground truth what is happening on the ground in what is thought to be deep red Texas yeah we're obviously seeing a lot of enthusiasm surrounding his campaign and it's been sustained and growing enthusiasm which has been somewhat impressive considering that he has been campaigning now for well over a year traveling across the state pretty much non-stop since March or April of 2017 and I think that what you know what's resonating is kind of this sense of authenticity that see with him whether it's these town halls these kind of come come one come all town halls that he's having across the state whether it's live streaming kind of every moment from the campaign trail and you know and that certainly provides something of a contrast with Cruz who certainly you know is it can be a relentless campaigner but can also have this image of being kind of politically calculating or just kind of overly scripted and so you do see just kind of the stylistic contrast their stylistic and intent Cruz I say this was a decent amount of authority is not well-liked among a lot of Republicans does they don't have a chance of winning over some independents and some sort of centrist Republicans in the state who sometimes swing statewide elections you know I think so I think this is a slice of that part of the electorate is in play I think it remains to be seen how big it is but you know whether it was you know before Ted Cruz ran for president after Ted Cruz ran for president after the kind of 2016 Trump endorsement controversy there's always been some some Republicans in Texas who have just not been a huge fan of him either personally or because of his kind of brand of politics and you know he is kind of this conservative firebrand and he's you know clearly made some enemies in Washington and certainly enemies with his within his own party one of the ways that I thought after the election that I should have known that Donald Trump was going to win was at Costco there were lots of Trump pence bumper stickers when I drove around the rural parts of Connecticut there were more yard signs and it is not scientific but after the fact you sometimes look back at those anecdotal proof points and say yeah I saw this coming what does Texas Texas look like right now are there more are there are there better signs and places where there usually aren't democratic yard signs are there people talking about this race where they usually aren't talking politics for a midterm what's going on in the state yeah yard signs are actually a huge story in the state right now there's been you know Cruz supporters themselves have expressed alarm about seeing Beto yard signs and they're kind of traditionally Republican neighborhoods are kind of traditionally moderate or independent minded neighborhoods the Cruz campaign has you know talked about our yard signs don't vote and how that hasn't been a huge investment on their part so far but it's just psychologically it's stuff like that I think that has worried some Cruz supporters and given hope and optimism obviously you know to work supporters however anecdotal it may be Mike Murphy what do you make of this race well I remember Wendy Davis in the red tennis shoes we've had this narrative before about the magic Democrat intent she ever within three or four points versus have been an early poll where's five or something but here are the three things that need to happen for the perfect storm for him in a Republican state one got to raise a lot of money he's doing that on the Internet - you're gonna have to make sure the race is not ideological but a personality contest he's a very likable guy Ted has been rather cruelly I think described by British newspapers of sitcom vampire so if it's a personality contest that's better for bado and finally you need a blue storm surge not 5% you need 10% because it's still Texas it is getting more purple but he'll have to put a lot of stuff together so do I think it's possible yes would I bet heavy money I take cruise one of the dangers seems to me when you make too many parallels to national figures a lot of people talking about how he has that it factor that president who then state senator Obama had people comparing his communication skills to other national figures that seems double-edged well I mean look he's definitely a rock star right now in the Democratic Party we talked about him were excited about him we can't believe what he's able to do in a deep red as you stated Texas State but he's also the right combination of grassroots activism he has he's on message he's unapologetically running as a progressive in Texas enrichment he said he's gonna impede he's part of a Schumer there on the deal that he would have done on dreamers and also if some polls have showed that building a wall is very unpopular in Texas if the trade war is unpopular the GOP tax cut is unpopular so there are things there that really is helping him in many ways that is hurting Ted Cruz yeah he's sort of late-stage bobby kennedy very appealing very progressive very human but the thing as Mike said is and I haven't looked at these demographic numbers in a while I'm in Texas is getting more purple it is getting more diverse but until it crosses that threshold and sort of like 40 it's not really the time and place for a Democratic to Democrat to win what I would say though is in this age of social media where we know everybody everything about everybody Abraham Lincoln ran for president after losing a race for Congress Beto is now a national figure and would actually run for national office just based on what we know about him and from seeing that viral video of him defending the NFL players and the right to protest two things here first of all of Texas is a red state it is not the most Pro Trump of the red states Trump underperformed in Texas so I think something going on there and second thing going on there is his crassness and it's the basement of the office is not really appreciated in a state like Texas here was not mine but I would say that our work is going around to almost every county he is out there asking for votes he is doing what Barack Obama did in a place like Iowa he went to places where Democrats are never seen and he's planting the flag and he's saying this is who I am and he's not doing a thing where he's like being a fake Democrat or a half to norv is like I'm a Democrat I'm a progressive it's harmful bumpy October they're gonna drop the ideological hammer on him really really big but when they try to straight to the presidential primary he'll be very formidable hey there
