1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,939
Some people love the Oxford comma.

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,730
Just ask Vox's copy editors, Rob Lowe and
James Van Der Beek.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,730
Wait.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,730
Add a comma.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,049
Just ask Vox's copy editors, Rob Lowe, and
James Van Der Beek.

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,520
The Oxford comma, serial comma, whatever you
want to call it comma is that comma plunked

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,370
down before the "and" on a list.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,680
People who like it say it adds clarity and
makes reading things easier.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,860
But organizations like the AP don't use it
in their style book.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,350
They're what's technically known as...wrong.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,720
It's a heated debate.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,170
There's a whole Twitter account that just
asked celebrities about their Oxford comma

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,289
preferences — that's how we know Rob Lowe
is "pro" and Van Der Beek thinks only "animals"

14
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,850
would ditch the Oxford comma.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,730
But where did the world's most controversial
punctuation come from?

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,769
Oxford is not the whole answer.

17
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,280
Communication researcher Jasso Lamberg wanted
to know: who invented it?

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,190
It required a kind of detective hunt.

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,359
"I tried Googling it and I just couldn't find
the actual history of it."

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,640
Usually, he checks things on the Oxford English
Dictionary, but the Oxford English Dictionary

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,220
didn't have a good answer about the Oxford
comma.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,789
"So according to the OED, the first recorded
use of this term is supposed to be Peter H.

23
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:21,040
Sutcliffe's book from 1978."

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,130
The phrase "Oxford comma" was kind of new,
but could its usage really be that recent?

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,649
In his book, Sutcliffe explains the comma
came from rulebooks written a hundred years

26
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:32,649
ago.

27
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:37,880
A guy named F.H. Collins wrote those rulebooks,
codifying the punctuation that Lupita Nyong'o

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,920
said she couldn't live without.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,810
But that's not all — Collins said he got
the idea from a letter from Herbert Spencer,

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,369
who thought the comma was key in "marking
out the elements of a thought."

31
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,210
And at the time, Herbert Spencer was a legend.

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,079
Charles Darwin did not come up with the term
"survival of the fittest" — Herbert Spencer

33
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,469
did.

34
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:03,079
Spencer was a classic Victorian generalist.

35
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,909
He was a jack of all trades who did philosophy
and science.

36
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:13,540
In the 1860s, Darwin, Spencer, Thomas Huxley,
and others all pushed evolution into the mainstream

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,620
of culture.

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,760
Here's Darwin and Spencer, just chattin'.

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,370
Spencer's survival of the fittest expanded
to social Darwinism, the competition between

40
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,990
people, not just species.

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,750
He was massively influential, selling hundreds
of thousands of copies of his books and inspiring

42
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,549
authors, like H.G. Wells's divergent races
in "The Time Machine."

43
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,750
But over time, his worldview lost to the competition.

44
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,489
Darwin became the name people associated with
evolution.

45
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:49,130
Spencer turned into an often maligned figure
in philosophy and a footnote to the culture

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,390
at large.

47
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,010
Social Darwinism became of a piece with eugenics
in the popular culture.

48
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,430
But Spencer really did believe in efficiency
and clarity.

49
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,370
Our culture and science have changed from
a mutton-chopped Victorian's theories, but

50
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,870
our sentences still need to be clear.

51
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,120
And that's why the Oxford comma is still the
right choice for my coworkers, Neil de Grasse

52
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,439
Tyson and Adam Savage.

53
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,390
Uh, comma please.

54
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,430
OK, so what is the best argument against an
Oxford comma.

55
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,760
After all, there are people who don't like
it, from the AP to Talib Kweli — who is

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,060
the son of of an English professor.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,290
And they might say that the Oxford comma can't
hide bad writing.

58
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,209
So, for example, if you looked at our sentence
in the beginning of the video and made "copy

59
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,040
editors" singular, even an Oxford comma would
make it look like Rob Lowe had a job at Vox

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,000
which, sadly, he does not.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,900
I, however, have to side with Spencer, because
in that letter to Collins he said that commas

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
equal pauses.

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,790
And when you have a list, you want a pause
for each item, and only an Oxford comma can

64
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,790
do that.

65
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,120
So that hopefully will settle it and there
will never be another argument about this

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,530
ever again.

67
00:04:03,530 --> 00:00:00,000
There...yeah...
