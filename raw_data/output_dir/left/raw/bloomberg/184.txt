1
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:34,860
"Today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions
are nearly 80 percent bigger

2
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,940
than before we bailed them out because they were too big to fail."

3
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,700
Well, sort of. We didn't bail out all the
big banks, but the biggest U.S. banks are

4
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,980
just as big if not bigger than they were before
the crisis in 2008.

5
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:02,290
JP Morgan Chase is 75% bigger than it was in 2006. Bank of America is 50%. Wells Fargo is four times

6
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:10,930
bigger. Only Morgan Stanley and Citigroup
are slightly smaller than they were.

7
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,759
During the height of the crisis, the relatively
healthy banks ended up buying the failing

8
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,420
banks as a way of rescue and these rescues
were backed in some cases by the government.

9
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:31,250
JP Morgan bought Washington Mutual and Bear
Stearns. Bank of America got Countrywide and

10
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:39,890
Merrill Lynch. Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia,
a rival that was actually bigger in size.

11
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,030
We've had hundreds of laws and regulations
in the U.S. and around the world to make sure

12
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,850
that the US taxpayer is not on the hook next
time around.

13
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,770
Capital at the biggest five banks on average
is 6%, which is twice as much as it was before

14
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,230
the crisis but it's still miniscule compared
to historic levels.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,849
Eight years after the fall of Lehman Brothers
"Too Big To Fail" is clearly still alive.

16
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:21,030
There are plenty of opinions about why and
how to deal with it but one thing is for sure

17
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,280
â€¦
Risk in the financial system is still unknown

18
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,730
and can suddenly pop up.
Nobody can be sure that the dominoes won't

19
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,790
start falling again like they did in 2008.
And with banks even bigger now, American taxpayers

20
00:02:37,790 --> 00:00:00,000
may be asked once again to pick up the pieces.
