1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,131
MILITARY SECRETS.

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:05,267
THE REGIME ARRESTED HIM IN 2015,

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,669
SENTENCED HIM TO A DECADE OF

4
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:08,037
HARD LABOR.

5
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:11,173
LET'S TURN TO BILL RICHARDSON,

6
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:12,441
NEGOTIATED THE RELEASE OF AN

7
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:13,776
AMERICAN PRISONER IN NORTH KOREA

8
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:14,777
IN 1996.

9
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:16,344
NOT EASY, IS IT, SIR?

10
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:17,913
>> NO, IT'S NOT EASY.

11
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:19,849
THIS IS TYPICAL OF THE NORTH

12
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:20,182
KOREANS.

13
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:21,884
THEY DRUM UP A LOT OF INTEREST.

14
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:25,521
I SUSPECT THEY WILL RELEASE THE

15
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:29,825
THREE BUT THEN THEY USE THEM AS

16
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:30,926
BARGAINING CHIPS.

17
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:33,028
IN THE PAST, YOU SEND A BIG

18
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:34,663
FORMER PRESIDENT, CARTER OR

19
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:36,732
CLINTON, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE

20
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:37,099
PRISONERS.

21
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:38,467
IN THIS CASE, WHAT THEY GET IN

22
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,269
RETURN IS A SUMMIT WITH THE

23
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:41,070
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

24
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,372
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS

25
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:43,706
WANTED.

26
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:44,807
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT SAYS

27
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:46,909
THE ONE REASON FOR THAT SUMMIT

28
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,480
IS TO DO AWAY WITH THEIR NUCLEAR

29
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,085
PROGRAM, TO END THEIR

30
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:56,552
NUCLEARIZATION.

31
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:59,388
ARE THERE SIGNS THAT NORTH KOREA

32
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:01,190
WILL BE WILLING TO DO THAT?

33
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,825
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN

34
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:03,626
INTERESTING SUMMIT.

35
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:04,827
WE HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION

36
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:07,329
FROM THE NORTH KOREANS ON WHAT

37
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:07,997
DENUCLEARIZATION IS.

38
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:10,366
FOR THE PRESIDENT, FOR US,

39
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:11,967
IT'S -- THEY'RE GOING TO

40
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,135
DISMANTLE THEIR WEAPONS.

41
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:14,837
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS, IT'S A

42
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:15,437
FREEZE.

43
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:16,572
WE'RE GOING TO STOP DEVELOPMENT

44
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,407
OF MISSILES, NUCLEAR.

45
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:20,509
SO THAT HAS TO BE NARROWED DOWN

46
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:21,944
IN THE SUMMIT.

47
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:25,281
I THINK THE RELEASE OF THIS

48
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:28,050
PRISONER, YOU SET A GOOD TONE

49
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,919
RELEASING THEM ON HUMANITARIAN

50
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:30,252
REASONS.

51
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:32,087
THE NORTH KOREANS, THAT I WERE

52
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:33,122
TRUMPED UP CHARGES.

53
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:34,056
YOU MENTIONED THEM.

54
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:35,491
THEY WERE AMERICANS TEACHING

55
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,393
THERE, DOING BUSINESS, HOSTILE

56
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:37,693
ACTS.

57
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,128
YOU KNOW, THE NORTH KOREANS

58
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:40,396
ALWAYS DO THAT.

59
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:41,530
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

60
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,766
PRESIDENT HAS TO DO IS SAY TO

61
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,367
NORTH KOREA, STOP DETAINING

62
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:45,734
AMERICANS.

63
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,870
STOP DETAINING PEOPLE THAT COME

64
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,605
IN AND LEAVE THEM ALONE AND STOP

65
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:52,341
USING THEM AS BARGAINING CHIPS.

66
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,543
THAT'S ANOTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT

67
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:57,213
THAT MIGHT MAKE THE SUMMIT A

68
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:57,580
SUCCESS.

69
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,747
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT HAS

70
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:00,649
TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY HOLDING

71
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,017
THIS SUMMIT AROUND THE PEACE

72
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:04,186
HOUSE AROUND THE DENUCLEARIZED

73
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:05,721
ZONE THERE BETWEEN NORTH AND

74
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:06,121
SOUTH KOREA.

75
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,289
HE SAID IT WOULD BE GREAT TO

76
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:09,191
HAVE A CELEBRATION OF THINGS

77
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:09,491
THERE.

78
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:11,327
IN REALITY, WOULDN'T THERE BE A

79
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:14,597
LOT OF NEGOTIATING AFTER THE

80
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:14,930
SUMMIT?

81
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,631
>> YES.

82
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,733
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS, SHEP,

83
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,768
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS, YOU

84
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:21,170
NEGOTIATE NOT ACROSS THE TABLE.

85
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,805
THAT'S NOT WHEN THEY MAKE

86
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:23,239
CONCESSIONS.

87
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,009
THEY DO IT IN INFORMAL

88
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:27,576
GATHERINGS.

89
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,812
EITHER DINING OR WALKING

90
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:31,647
TOGETHER AND MAKING DEALS.

91
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,549
I THINK WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT

92
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,417
IS THAT THE TWO PRESIDENTS

93
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,286
DEVELOP SOME KIND OF A PERSONAL

94
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:37,720
RELATIONSHIP.

95
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,321
I WORRY THAT AT THE PEACE HOUSE,

96
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:42,091
I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES, THE

97
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,026
FACILITY IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO

98
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:47,029
MEETING OUTSIDE OF JUST THE

99
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:47,529
FORMAL TABLE.

100
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:50,466
SO YOU KNOW, I SAW THAT

101
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,368
SINGAPORE IS A POSSIBILITY.

102
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:53,469
KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T LIKE TO

103
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:54,837
TRAVEL BY AIRPLANE.

104
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:57,940
HE LIKES TO TRAVEL BY RAIL.

105
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,541
SO MAYBE A RUSSIAN ISLAND.

106
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,709
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING

107
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,877
TO DECIDE.

108
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:04,013
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE SECTION

109
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,515
OF THE SUMMIT FOR INFORMAL

110
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:06,882
SETTINGS.

111
00:03:06,882 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE DEALS
