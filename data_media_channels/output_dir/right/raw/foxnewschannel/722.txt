1
00:00:00,732 --> 00:00:02,799
IT'S UN-AMERICAN TO DO WHAT HAS

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,134
BEEN DONE.

3
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:05,169
>> ALL OF THOSE UGLY BIGOTED

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,570
RULINGS USUALLY FIND THE DUSTPAN

5
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,539
AND I THINK THIS WILL TOO.

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,174
>> Martha: HERE NOW PATRICK

7
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:11,742
MORRISSEY, WHO SUPPORTS THE BAN

8
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:12,910
AND IS ALSO RUNNING AGAINST

9
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:13,577
DEMOCRAT JOE MANCHIN IN THE

10
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,946
SENATE RACE THERE AND MY GERMAN,

11
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:21,418
MUSLIM AMERICANS IMPACTED BY THE

12
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:22,352
TRAVEL BAN.

13
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:26,790
JUST TO GO BACK TO THE PRESIDENT

14
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,257
SIMPLE QUESTION.

15
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:28,859
WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO'S COMING OR

16
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,727
ANY ARGUMENT FROM THESE FIVE

17
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:31,461
COUNTRIES AT THIS MOMENT THEIR

18
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:32,162
VETTING SYSTEM ISN'T EFFECTIVE

19
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,932
ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE

20
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:35,832
NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO WISH US

21
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,935
HARM TO COME.

22
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,836
>> AS YOU MENTIONED, THIS IS THE

23
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,308
THAT HIS PURPOSE FOR INSTITUTING

24
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,578
THIS POLICY WAS TO BAN MUSLIMS

25
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,278
FROM COMING INTO THE

26
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:48,712
UNITED STATES.

27
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,714
>> Martha: THERE'S A HUGE

28
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:51,915
MUSLIM POPULATION, MANY

29
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,517
COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED

30
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:54,551
IN THIS BAN.

31
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:55,319
>> ABSOLUTELY.

32
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,119
>> Martha: IF HE REALLY WANTED

33
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,554
TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO BAN

34
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:57,955
ALL OF THEM.

35
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,359
WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT'S

36
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,860
INEFFECTIVE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT

37
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:07,531
HE WANTS AND ALSO INEFFECTIVE

38
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:08,632
SECURITY AND DOZENS OF NATIONAL

39
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,968
SECURITY PROFESSIONALS SIGNED ON

40
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,970
ACKNOWLEDGING NOT JUST THAT THIS

41
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:14,571
WOULD NOT IMPROVE SECURITY BUT

42
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:16,306
IT WOULD ACTUALLY HARM SECURITY.

43
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:17,241
>> Martha: THE PRESIDENTS WILL

44
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:18,976
TAKE CARE, AND THE SUPREME COURT

45
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:19,776
RULED THAT WHATEVER THE

46
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,178
PRESIDENT SET ALONG THE WAY IS

47
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:21,812
NOT AN ISSUE TO THEM.

48
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,547
THEY LOOK AT THE LETTER OF THE

49
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:26,650
WAY THIS IS LAID OUT AND THEY

50
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:28,118
SEE IT AS FIVE COUNTRIES THAT

51
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,253
ARE ON A TEMPORARY BAN UNTIL

52
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:31,388
THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEIR

53
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,356
VETTING SYSTEM WORKS.

54
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:33,790
>> I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT

55
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,891
THE PRESIDENT ACTED WITHIN HIS

56
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:38,362
AUTHORITY ALL ALONG BECAUSE HE

57
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:40,764
HAS THE ABILITY UNDER BOTH THE

58
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:41,798
CONSTITUTION AND STATUTES TO

59
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,200
ENGAGE IN A PROCESS TO VET

60
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:44,134
ALIENS THAT COME INTO THE

61
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:46,336
COUNTRY AND AS YOU PROPERLY

62
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,871
POINTED OUT ON THIS RECENT

63
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:51,341
TRAVEL BAN, ONLY FIVE AND THERE

64
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:52,843
ARE PROBABLY ANOTHER 45 OR 50

65
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:53,510
MUSLIM COUNTRIES THAT WERE

66
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:56,113
ACTUALLY NOT PART OF THAT

67
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:56,880
PROCESS BECAUSE THEIR PROCEDURES

68
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,515
WERE DETERMINED TO BE STRONG.

69
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:02,352
THE PRESIDENT I THINK HAS ACTED

70
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:04,521
CONSISTENTLY ALL ALONG.

71
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:05,188
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

72
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:05,856
SECURITY HAS GONE THROUGH AN

73
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,324
EXTENSIVE VETTING PROCESS AND

74
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,660
THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO POKE HOLES

75
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:10,927
IN IT.

76
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:12,362
THIS IS THE RIGHT DECISION.

77
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:13,363
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS STOOD UP FOR

78
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:21,371
THIS COUNTRY SAFE, DO YOU FEEL

79
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:23,340
CONFIDENT THAT YEMEN, FOR

80
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,842
EXAMPLE, HAS AN AIRTIGHT SYSTEM

81
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:26,943
OF VETTING PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE

82
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,644
THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME

83
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:30,380
HERE FROM YEMEN OR SUDAN THAT

84
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:35,752
>> I WOULD NEVER ARGUE THAT

85
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:38,355
THERE IS ANY COUNTRY THAT HAS A

86
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,556
PERFECT SYSTEM OR ANYWHERE NEAR

87
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:41,358
A PERFECT SYSTEM BUT IF WE LOOK

88
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,326
AT WHO HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A

89
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:45,662
ENGLAND.

90
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:47,764
RICHARD REID, THE SHOE BOMBER.

91
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,132
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM OTHER

92
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,901
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO

93
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:53,737
DO WITH THIS BAN.

94
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:54,938
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

95
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:55,972
SECURITY, LET'S FOCUS ON THOSE

96
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,775
VERY FEW PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY

97
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,377
POSING A PROBLEM AND NOT IMPOSE

98
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:01,745
A HARDSHIP ON THE MANY

99
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,680
THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

100
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:05,482
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TOTALLY

101
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:06,950
INNOCENT THAT AREN'T TRYING TO

102
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:08,352
HARM AMERICA AND ARE ACTUALLY

103
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:09,353
TRYING TO HELP AMERICA.

104
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:10,554
>> Martha: YOUR MAIN ARGUMENT

105
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:11,555
IS THAT IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE.

106
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:15,125
THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE US SAFER?

107
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:15,826
>> THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT

108
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:17,894
IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THAT IT

109
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:22,432
HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR

110
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,200
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHTS

111
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,702
OF AMERICANS TO HAVE THEIR

112
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:26,403
FAMILY MEMBERS -- GO

113
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:31,475
>> I THINK YOU GO BACK TO WHAT

114
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:34,544
WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

115
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:34,878
EARLIER.

116
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,714
A SMALL SUBSET OF MUSLIM

117
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:38,782
COUNTRIES AND ONE THING YOU ARE

118
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:39,816
SEEING IS THAT IF COUNTRIES GET

119
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:42,919
BETTER VETTING SYSTEMS AND

120
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,620
INFORMATION SHARING THEY GET

121
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:45,555
REMOVED FROM THE LIST.

122
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:46,823
>> Martha: IRAQ IS THE

123
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:47,391
EXAMPLE.

124
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:48,258
IT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL ORDER,

125
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,761
IT'S NOT IN THIS ORDER.

126
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:51,528
>> THAT'S JUST THOUGHTFULNESS ON

127
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:52,763
THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE TO

128
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:54,197
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IMPLEMENTING

129
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:56,266
A LAW FOCUSED ON NATIONAL

130
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:56,967
SECURITY INTERESTS.

131
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:59,369
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE WHAT

132
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,737
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TODAY, THIS

133
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:01,938
ADMINISTRATION HAS BENT OVER

134
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,240
BACKWARDS TO DO THIS THE RIGHT

135
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,741
WAY.

136
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:05,942
THIS IS THE THIRD ITERATION.

137
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:07,144
THERE'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE

138
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,345
SUPREME COURT UPHELD WHAT THEY

139
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:08,712
DID TODAY.

140
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:09,579
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

141
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,313
DRAMATIC IF THEY HAD ACTUALLY

142
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:13,550
GONE THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE IF

143
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:15,552
YOU THINK ABOUT THE PLAINTIFF'S

144
00:04:15,553 --> 00:04:16,620
ARGUMENTS, THEY WOULD LITERALLY

145
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,793
EPIDEMIC OR A POTENTIAL NATIONAL

146
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:23,560
SECURITY RISK WHICH YOU KNOW IS

147
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,929
EMANATING FROM A COUNTRY.

148
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,531
THEIR APPROACH WOULD LIMIT THE

149
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:28,732
PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY TO PROTECT

150
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:29,433
OUR NATION AND THAT'S NOT

151
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,767
PROPER.

152
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:31,735
>> Martha: THE JUSTICES HAVE

153
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:35,739
VOTED IN FAVOR OF THIS WENT BY

154
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,341
THE WORDS THAT WERE IN THIS

155
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,242
DOCUMENT AND APPLIED THEM AS

156
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:39,609
THEY SAW.

157
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,378
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.

158
00:04:41,379 --> 00:00:00,000
PLEASE COME BACK.
