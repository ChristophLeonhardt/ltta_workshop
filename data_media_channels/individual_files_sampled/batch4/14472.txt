I mean let me just ask you about the title militant normals that's that sounds sort of like jumbo shrimp or something it sounds like a contradiction in terms I mean if someone's normal are they militant so tell me a bit more about your thinking there I want to wrap my mind around it well you know normals are normal people usually aren't militant normal people are the people who just want to live their lives they're the people who built this contrary who feed this contrary fuel this country defend this country they're the heart and soul of the country and they don't want to do what you and I want to do all the time which is be involved in politics right I mean I I enjoy it it's something I like but you know most of the people I see in my normal non-political life they won't be with it you know they're going out to do soccer with their kids or involved in their church they've got their hobbies you know they're going hiking whatever politics just isn't isn't everything to them and they just want with their lives trusting a the elite the certain class of people to go and run the institutions effectively and for their benefit to provide them security and prosperity except our elitist kind of broken its end of the deal hmm well I mean it's funny you saying that because the idea of severely nor I I like the phrase severely normal and severely normal people Roger I may not use your term militant normal normal people saying you know what enough of this we saw with yes we're seeing in parts of Europe we saw it last night in a Canadian province called New Brunswick where a third of the third of the voters voted for new parties that didn't even exist before it you know I think that it's not just an uprising against political elites it's an uprising against the media elites to who do the shilling for the political leads we agree with that well yes the media elites are part of the elite are kind of their voice but you know this I hate to sound like a Marxist but a lot of this Ezra is about class and we have an elite that has distinguished itself from the normal Americans they're supposed to be you know working on behalf of and and you you can you can see it look at look at Hollywood 70 years ago you had movies like It's a Wonderful Life which celebrated normal people normal values showed them as the repository of the values and the qualities that made our culture great that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
