6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,210
youngstarr the moment philosophy I've

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,400
really really really got into a panic

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,230

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,939
myself and then I managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember</font>

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,949
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and use the morn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my bed</font>

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">and my third hour of what and I thinking</font>

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,260
went really well i had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rigid well the</font>

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,180
first paper was quite hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the end</font>

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,559
the third paper i think which was the

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,320
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's worried that Sartre went a lot</font>

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,430
better than I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought because the</font>

20
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,750
question was something like was

21
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,149
something about freedom it was them

22
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,700

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,770
are man is free which is fun it's great

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,660
it's great to rip them to shreds it's

25
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,190
great fun and I like to promote freedom

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,140
I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting so yeah</font>

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,820
that was really cool so now for you

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,410
