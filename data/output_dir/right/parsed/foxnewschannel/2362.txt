DEAL AND WE WILL KEEP YOU
UPDATED.
ROB: IT PREFACES DONALD TRUMP'S
MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN.
DOMESTIC POLITICS, ALL EYES ON
WEST VIRGINIA AS WE LOOK TOWARD
A CRUCIAL MIDTERM ELECTION.
WHICH ARE THE OTHER RACES WE
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR, THIS
ELECTION SEASON HAS SEEN MORE
HEATED THAN EVER.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
LET'S START IN WEST VIRGINIA.
SEEMINGLY TWO PEOPLE WE ARE
FOCUSED ON.
>> IT IS THAT WE 2-PERSON RACE
BETWEEN PAT MORRISSEY AND ONE
OF THOSE THINGS, THE REASON
THERE IS SO MUCH EXCITEMENT ON
THE PENTAGON SIDE, THEY THINK
THEY CAN BEAT JOE MENTION --
MANCHIN.
DONALD TRUMP WON 42% OF THE
VOTE.
HE TRIED TO TIE HIMSELF BACK TO
TRUMP.
A BIG PROBLEM, ON THE TWO
BIGGEST VOTES IN THE SENATE,
OBAMACARE AND THE TAX CUTS HE
VOTED WITH CHUCK SCHUMER AND
NANCY PELOSI.
THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM FOR WEST
VIRGINIA VOTERS.
AND EVAN JENKINS.
WHAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING IN THE
GROUND.
I HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH PEOPLE
ON THE GROUND, PAT MORRISSEY, A
LOT OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND, THE
CONSERVATIVE REFORMER, A GREAT
CAMPAIGNER WHO FINISHED AT THE
END OF THE DAY.
FOLKS ON THE GROUND.
>> OHIO THE CLASSIC SWING
STATE.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE?
>> A LOT OF FUN, SHERROD BROWN
HAS RUN SLICK CAMPAIGNS OVER
THE YEARS, RAISE A LOT OF
MONEY, BUT IS TOO LIBERAL FOR
OHIO SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING,
YOU HAVE MIKE GIBBONS, JIM
WRENACY AND MIKE GIBBONS
RUNNING AS A BUSINESSMAN,
ANOTHER RACE IN THE RUSTBELT
WHERE DONALD TRUMP WON BY EIGHT
POINTS.
JILLIAN: I PRINTED UP AN
ARTICLE FROM THE CHICAGO
TRIBUNE AND SUBJECT LINE IS
DON'T EVEN KNOW, NATION'S
NASTIEST GOP PRIMARY IN ALABAMA
COMMISSIONED INSIGHT INTO WHY.
>> THEY THINK THEY CAN BEAT JOE
DONNELLY.
A LOT HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATIC INTENSITY IN SPECIAL
ELECTIONS BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU
ARE SEEING A LOT OF INTENSITY
AND REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES.
AND PRIMARIES HAVE A BAD
REPUTATION AT TIMES.
AND THEY CHOOSE THE BEST
CANDIDATE.
>> ARIZONA, NEVADA, FLORIDA.
>> THE BIG CHEER IN FLORIDA 10
DAYS AGO FROM REPUBLICANS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAS WHEN
RICK SCOTT GOT INTO THE SENATE
RACE.
REPUBLICANS THINK THEY CAN BEAT
BILL NELSON BUT THE TRUTH IS
YOU LOOK AT RICK SCOTT HE HAS A
TREMENDOUS RECORD OF THE
GOVERNOR, HAS COME OUT GUNS
BLAZING TALKING ABOUT TERM
LIMITS, A LOT OF SUPPORT BEHIND
HIM, NEVADA, DEAN HELLER, THE
ONLY REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR
REELECTION IN A STATE HILLARY
CLINTON WON.
ONLY 3 POINTS.
ROB: JEFF FLAKE AS WELL.
>> NO QUESTION.
DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB.
AND WHAT WILL HELP WITH THE
PRIMARY, YOU GET A GOOD
