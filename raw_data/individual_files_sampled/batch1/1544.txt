here at The Listening Post when we've examined the media story in Brazil we focused on the conglomerates like Globo TV hacker TV SBT and the power that they wield this time as the country prepares to vote in the first round of presidential elections on Sunday October 7th we're looking at social media that's because Brazil is Facebook's third largest market more than half of the population there is on whatsapp that's where Brazil's far-right presidential candidate Jaya bolson ro has taken his political campaign bolson ro has been described by some as Donald Trump meets Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte and like them he's turned the mainstream media into his useful enemies bolson ro has a 10-point lead in the polls in a country whose traditional parties have been stained by scandal a populist outsider has moved into the political vacuum our starting point this week is one of the primary battlegrounds in this election the social media space in Brazil je boson are on one of the primary information tools affecting this election is mobile phone social media allows him to work without filters in Brazil they don't trust politicians but also they don't trust the mainstream media they don't think that what appears in the media is truth so the fiber poster is relying so much on social media it's part of his appeal also nada no outdoors he's not a front-runner by chance he's a candidate who's very strong on whatsapp on social media people get a lot of feeds lots of videos from votes on a door and it's no accident that he's leading the polls a year Bowl senado spent years in the National Assembly as a fringe politician before becoming the leader of a relatively small party which he's taken to the right he's ex-military makes no secret of his admiration for the hunter that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 85 and he's running on a law-and-order ticket he goes into the first round of this election as the front-runner consistently polling at over 30 percent despite being the victim of a stabbing last month from which he says he's still recovering his critics call him homophobic misogynistic that's what happens when you equate homosexuality with pedophilia or you go on camera and call a female political opponent unworthy of being raped then there was the time he called for the sterilization of the poor in a country where more than 50 million live in poverty both tomorrow's supporters either don't find any of those things disqualified or they don't believe them when they're reported on mainstream news outlets because millions of them are getting their news straight from the candidate on whatsapp or from his supporters like Douglas Garcia the founder of the errata South Paulo a movement pushing balso narrows agenda on social media coca quiz Kelly public anything he publishes on social media gets amplified he was not the one to build the Internet as a medium to propagate his political campaign but it was the conservatives who found in the internet a medium to exchange information without putting their personal security in danger to disseminate the ideas that were sewn out of managed to integrate into his campaign as it will not be censored on social media unlike what happens on the mainstream media where he has no voice what is happening in Brazil is that social media is facilitating and carriers that are portraying himself as outside the establishment and no matter how we can question that they can easily reach their supporters and they can counteract what is happening even though there is some information available there the members of these groups prefer to believe what their own candidates or what the people supporting their candidates are saying everything that goes against what they believe is it's a mention as fake news Brazilians are just on social media they are to an unusual degree involved the Facebook numbers there are through the roof and when polled recently on whether they have used social media as a source of news over the previous week two out of three said yes that's more than twice as high as Germany almost 50% higher than the US about 120 million Brazilians more than one in two are on whatsapp news spreads quickly on whatsapp groups and since it's coming from friends family or the candidates themselves it's up close feels personal and it's 24/7 the very government TV is still important to Brazilians but the flow of information about the election is much greater on what sound TV is still watched in places where the internet is not so popular among the poorest segments of the population but the internet social networks and especially whatsapp have made all the difference and unfortunately a lot of it is misinformation a lot of lies end up circulating people believe them because they're often from people close to them say family members who circulate these messages these videos that's how it ends up becoming credible but it's a lie and both tornadoes political strategy is to spread fake news to spread lies pinning the fake news charge on bolson Otto personally is difficult but there's no doubt that some of his supporters have been producing plenty of that kind of material in July Facebook shut down almost 300 pages and accounts run by a conservative political group known as M BL for as Facebook put it hiding behind fake accounts misleading Brazilians about the origin of the content and spreading this information fact checkers have been working overtime in this election but they are struggling to keep up and have an impact many of them are scouring pro-bowl senado social media platforms for fake news and some of those platforms offer media watch services of their own focusing on the output of mainstream news outlets also among the edges the chipping away at their credibility and in doing so defending the interests of their chosen candidate Niro and his team attacked the traditional media a lot and they use social media to say he's a victim of attacks from the left who call him a fascist racist homophobe they use it to say his critics exaggerate they use it to deny statements he's made and they also use it to spread fake news these lies have a devastating effect a lot of people believe this misinformation up until four or five years ago there was more or less a belief that social media was a tool that was benefiting mostly left-wing groups against oppression I think now we have seen not only in the case of Brazil but also in brexit in the United States how right-wing groups particularly those in the fringe have successfully employed social media to spread their ideas to form community and also to question what they call is the establishment when Brazilians talk about the media establishment they're talking about global it's the biggest media company in Latin America hugely influential and the bane of the Brazilian left because it's conservative and has traditionally played the role of political kingmaker right-wing candidates have always courted global gyre bolson Otto didn't bother knowing he was too far right for the network's taste and betting he didn't need its endorsement he hasn't taken part in any televised debates since last month stabbing bosun ro says he can't doctor's orders not everyone believes that the final debate of round one took place this past Thursday three days before voting day again bolson ro was a no-show because of their bad shape he preferred not to appear on the debate aired on Globo the most important one because he knows that he could make mistakes and expose himself to attack from his opponents especially given his controversial proposals who here in the city prepared the water park so for you know just say she said him in theory the staffing helped because he had a good reason not to participate in the debates look I'm on medical treatment but he tended to avoid them even before the attack so while his opponents were debating each other on Globo he did an interview on a rival Network which then revealed it was back before calling it a night though he spent a little time on Facebook live talking to his supporters on the device that has driven his campaign changed Brazilian politics and the way it is covered is far
