I saw seth rogen the other day was on TV basically saying that he had dis paul ryan in front of his children is that so here's the thing if you don't want to take your picture with Paul Ryan because you differ politically it's petty but I get it I could see it maybe I wouldn't be rushing out to get Maxine Waters and I have a selfie but when his team kids are there yeah and you're gonna a refused the photo and then dress down their daddy in front of them now these are teenagers they're not like two and three year olds but it's still their father they didn't choose his political choices that is just gross to me and I've got kids and you know my kids are younger than that but if they were of a certain age and I was you know insulted directly in front of them I would feel terrible they would feel terrible and this cool hey I just met Seth Rogen took a picture with a moment turn into this oh he's a jerk and he was mean to my dad yeah yeah I mean there's this I you've gotta feel like this has to hurt business somehow I mean or am I wrong am I just that too hopeful is this hurting business I mean I guess De Niro was kind of past his prime but he could still be playing the Commissioner as they say in Hollywood you know at some point you stop playing the hero you start playing the commissioner of police but like but but he it does this hurt him at all I think it's hurting the brand the general okay I think what you have now in Hollywood is there are certain brands that are impenetrable the Marvel movies for example certain horror movies certain rebooted properties they you know they think that they're kind of Teflon at this point but if a De Niro puts out a movie where he's the main attraction I guarantee it's gonna make less money today that it would have maybe two or three or four years ago so I do think it will have an effect it can be subtle it can be more pronounced Peter Fonda has a new movie out they did very poorly over the weekend it was it based on what he said possibly it was a little film with not a lot of attention so it's hard to directly but this this is you know these stars don't realize that there's another star who's younger and better-looking right behind them and they could dazzle us just like they can and then if they're insulting us we will respond and I think the more and more conservatives are saying hey we can just not do this and get angry we cannot go see their movies
