1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,480
What if the President of the United States
decides to launch a nuclear strike?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,990
President Trump started 2018 with a tweet chiding
North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un that “he

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,660
too has a nuclear button”....

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,360
And it’s “bigger and more powerful”
than Kim's

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,720
But launching a missile involves much more
than pushing a button.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,330
And really, there is no button.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,260
Here’s what would actually need to happen.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,060
The president must first discuss the plan
with a group of military and civilian advisers.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,830
That group includes the Pentagon’s deputy
director of operations, and the head of U.S.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,770
Strategic Command- anyone else in the group
is at the President’s discretion.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,770
The call either takes place in the White House
Situation Room or the president can be patched

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,520
in on a secure line.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,470
Some of the advisers may try to change the
president’s mind or resign in protest, but

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,630
ultimately, the Pentagon must do whatever
the commander-in-chief orders.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,620
That meeting with advisors can be as short
as 30 seconds.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,730
Next the president gives the order to launch.

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,600
But before the Pentagon can prepare the launch
order, it must first verify that the

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,460
person ordering the strike is indeed the president.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,200
An officer in the Pentagon’s war room reads
what’s known as a “challenge code”.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,780
For example, “Delta-Echo.”

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,009
The president retrieves the “biscuit,”
a laminated card the president or a military

22
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,100
aide carries at all times, and finds the matching
response to the challenge code:

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,920
For example, “Charlie-Zulu”.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,659
Once the codes match, the launch order goes
out.

25
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,790
The war room prepares a message containing
the war plan, time of launch, authentication

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,659
codes and the codes needed to unlock the missiles
before firing them.

27
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,310
That message is only about 150 characters
long

28
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,109
It’s encoded, encrypted and broadcast to
launch crews.at this point only about 2-to-3

29
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,060
minutes may have passed since the initial
conference call.

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,789
Within seconds, a submarine and five ICBM
crews in various underground bunkers receive

31
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,789
the launch orders.

32
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,259
They open safes and compare their Sealed Authentication
System codes (SAS) to those sent by the war

33
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,259
room.

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,580
This will confirm that the order is authentic.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,139
If the codes match, the crews enter the war
plan number into their launch computers.

36
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:59,270
They type additional code to unlock the missiles,
and at the designated time of launch, the

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,569
five crews simultaneously turn a launch key
retrieved from their safe…

38
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:07,450
It only takes two crews to launch, so three
can refuse to do any of the prior steps and

39
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,300
the missile or missiles will still fire.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,120
For missiles are launched from a submarine,
there is no second key - the crew has full

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,670
power to launch.

42
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,180
From here, there is no turning back.

43
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,790
It’s been about AS LITTLE AS 5 minutes from
the time the president decided to launch a

44
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,349
nuclear missle to the time the missle or missile(s)
blast out of their silos.

45
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:28,670
It will take submarine missiles an additional
15 minutes until they shoot out of their tubes.

46
00:02:28,670 --> 00:00:00,000
Once it fires, a missile and its warhead cannot
be called back.
