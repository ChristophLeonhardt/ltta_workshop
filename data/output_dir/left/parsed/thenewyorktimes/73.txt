Rapid response hotline.
Yes, do you help
all immigrants,
or just Spanish,
Arabic, and Chinese?
Uh, is this an ICE raid?
Pardon?
Are you calling 
about an ICE raid?
Potential.
I’m just concerned.
I’m from a European country.
I’m here illegally
and I wondered
if you help Europeans
or just Spanish, Arabic,
and Chinese.
We help anyone who is
involved with an ICE raid.
But is there an ICE raid
happening right now?
I imagine.
This is an
emergency line, sir.
Can you please call
if there’s an ICE —
Well, I, like, I’m
having an emergency.
I am having an emergency.
There’s a bunch of illegal
people in our country
that shouldn’t be here
and assholes like —
Rapid response hotline.
You guys are going to have
some big surprises when
you go for certain raids.
You are going to get
some nice surprises,
you traitor .
Hi, San Francisco
Rapid Response Hotline.
Hi.
I own a restaurant and had a
few customers in here eating,
and they left, and they were
saying because of immigration
or ICE was on
24th and Mission.
This was about — I want
to say 20 minutes ago.
24th and Mission?
Well, the lady
got a phone call.
And she got a phone call, and
her whole facial expression
changed, and I was like,
is everything O.K.?
She was like, I have
to go, I have to go.
And there were
six other tables,
and I guess she told
them, so everyone left.
And how many customers
left the establishment?
That left, were 10.
Damn.
O.K. Your whole
restaurant left?
Hi, San Francisco
Rapid Response Hotline.
Hi there.
I’m at Mission — or
sorry, 2nd and Jessie
and there is a
Homeland Security
federal protective
police car sitting here.
I don’t see anybody.
I don’t see any ICE guys, but
this is a Homeland Security
car.
Oh wait, here they are, police D.H.S.
Oh.
It looks like they’re
on their lunch break.
(SINGING) Don’t
give up hope.
Don’t give up hope.
You’re not alone.
You’re not alone.
Don’t you give up.
Hi, I wanted to confirm
that there was ICE activity
in the Mission today.
So we’ve been receiving a
large volume of calls today,
reports about 24th and
Mission, 14th and Mission,
Marshall Elementary, and
the Foods Co in the Bayview
and the Foods Co
here in the Mission.
We’ve sent dispatchers to
all sites, no ICE activity.
They’ve all been
false alarms.
(SINGING) Look up ahead.
Look past despair.
Look past despair.
You gotta put one foot in
front of the other, and —
Hi, San Francisco
Rapid Response Hotline.
Yeah, I have a couple of
friends who are undocumented,
and they’re trying not to
draw attention to themselves,
but they’re wondering
if ICE does show up
in their neighborhood, and we
got the numbers from the news
to call, but
they’re unclear as
to exactly what your
organization will do.
Will they stop the
raids from happening?
Well, the fact is, that
when enforcement is happening
we can’t actually stop
it from happening.
But I thought you guys
stopped it from happening.
That’s what we
were looking for.
No I don’t think that
there’s any entity that
would be able to do
that, to actually stop
the enforcement —
Yeah, and you know
what’s really unfortunate,
I was talking to my friend,
is that because California
had made these sanctuaries,
they’ve called attention
to themselves, and
that is unfortunate.
This may have not
even been happening
if they never announced
that and bolstered it.
At least that’s what my
friends are thinking.
It’s like they
just caused it —
they just, they just made ICE
focus in on these places,
which is unfortunate.
It seems like it’s backfiring.
It’s crazy.
Yeah.
I hate it.
I thought the sanctuary
city stopped ICE.
No, no, no.
That’s not exactly
what sanctuary does.
Hello, Rapid
Response Hotline.
I’m calling because
my uncle was detained
by ICE on 24th and Mission.
He has already been taken?
Yeah, he has been taken.
Migration, I think, it was
there, on 24th and Mission.
24th and Mission.
O.K. just a second.
Do you know how old he is?
He was born on
November 2, 1952 — 1958.
Do you know what his status
was when he was taken?
Oh, his status?
— Hang up or press one.
Hello.
Hello?
You have a call from an
inmate in the Yuba County
Jail.
This call is from a
corrections facility
and is subject to
monitoring and recording.
Hello?
(SINGING) Lord prepare
me to be a sanctuary
Pure and holy,
tried and true-
With thanksgiving —
Good morning, Rapid
Response, how can I help you?
Didn’t you know it was
against the federal law
to harbor illegal immigrants?
Is this an emergency?
No.
Just keeping your lines busy.
(SINGING) Pure and
holy, tried and true.
With thanksgiving
I’ll be a living
sanctuary for you.
