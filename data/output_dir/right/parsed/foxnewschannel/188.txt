DOLLARS.

YES, SIR.
>> Reporter: CAN I ASK YOU
ANOTHER TOPIC.
THERE IS A REPORT THAT THE
SAUDIS MIGHT SAY THAT KHASHOGGI
WAS KILLED DURING THE
UNAUTHORIZED INTERROGATION.
>> President Trump: I JUST SAW
THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO SEE WHAT
THEY SAY.
WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSE WITH
SAUDI ARABIA AND TURKEY.
THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPEN.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
ALSO.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON T
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
M I HEARD THAT REPORT.
NOBODY KNOWS IF IT IS AN
OFFICIAL REPORT.
SO FAR, IT IS JUST A RUMOR.
YES, MA'AM.
>> Reporter: WHAT INSTRUCTIONS
DID YOU GIVE SECRETARY POMPEO
WHEN HE WAS SENT OVER?
>> President Trump: I AM SENDING
HIM JUST TO FIND OUT REALLY
FIRST-HAND WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT
THEY KNOW, WHAT'S GOING ON.
HE MAY GO TO TURKEY.
HE MAY NOT.
HE MAY MEET WITH ALL OF THEM
TOGETHER.
WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENED.
HE HAS GOT INSTRUCTIONS TO FIND
OUT WHAT HAPPENED.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE
SITUATION WITH SAUDI ARABIA THAT
YOU HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT I'M
SURE VERY MUCH.
IT IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT.

>> Reporter: WHAT ABOUT THE

>> President Trump: I WILL ONLY
DO IT IF I CAN TEST HER
PERSONALLY.
THAT WILL NOT BE SOMETHING THAT
I ENJOY DOING.
>> YOU SAID YOU ARE CONSIDERING
REVIVING THE CHILD SEPARATION
POLICY?
>> President Trump: I DIDN'T
CONSIDER ANYTHING.
I AM CONSIDERING CHANGING THE
IMMIGRATION LAWS.
WE HAVE THE WORST, AS THE
GOVERNOR CAN TELL YOU, AS
EVERYBODY CAN TELL YOU, FROM
YOUR TIME AS GOVERNOR.
WE HAVE THE WORST IMMIGRATION
LAWS AND THE DUMBEST IMMIGRATION
LAWS IN THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD.
THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
THAT HAS SUCH STUPID LAWS AS WE
DO.
SOMEBODY COMES INTO OUR COUNTRY.
THEY PUT ONE FOOT ON OUR LAND
AND WE HAVE TO BRING THEM
THROUGH A LONG COURT PROCESS OR
WE HAVE CATCH AND RELEASE, WHICH
IS EVEN WORSE.
WE CATCH THEM.
WE CATCH THEM, WE FIND OUT THEY
ARE A CRIMINAL.
WE WRITE THEM UP.
THEN, WE RELEASE THEM AND TELL
THEM TO COME BACK IN THREE, FOUR
YEARS FOR A COURT CASE.
THEY NEVER SHOW UP.
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST HERE BECAUSE
OF THE DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO HAVE THESE LAWS THAT
WAY.
IT IS SO CRAZY.
WE ARE GETTING THEM CHANGED ONE
BY ONE.
WE ARE VERY TOUGH ON THE BORDER.
WE HAVE TO BE.
WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL
IMMIGRATION LAWS.
THEY ARE A DISASTER, A LAUGHING
STOCK ALL OVER THE WORLD.
THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE A
LAUGHING STOCK WHEN I'M RUNNING
