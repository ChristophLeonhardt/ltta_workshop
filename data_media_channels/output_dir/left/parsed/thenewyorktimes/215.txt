This is what’s left of
the city of Marawi
in the southern Philippines.
A homegrown extremist
group loyal to ISIS
seized the city
about a year ago.
The result was the
longest urban combat
in the country
since World War II.
At least 350,000
people were displaced,
including the Magindiri family.
When they heard the first shots,
this family of six packed up
the car with the few belongings
they could grab and escaped
to a neighboring city.
Today is their first day
back home.
Across Marawi most
houses look like this,
or much worse.
It all started when a group
of about 900 pro-ISIS fighters
stormed this 
majority-Muslim city last May.
For five months,
the Philippine army,
with help from the
United States, pushed back.
They attacked with airstrikes
and close-fought urban combat.
In October, Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte declared
Marawi liberated.
And just last month,
the city was reopened
for residents to come in —
but only to see their homes,
recover what they can
and then leave again.
No one was allowed to stay
because large parts
of the city were still unsafe.
Bomb-removal squads
made up mostly of volunteers
were using flashlights
on their phones.
Only a few areas
had been checked
for unexploded ordnance.
And here people came home
to unidentified skeletal remains.
According to the
Philippine government,
at least 900 militants
and around 168 soldiers
were killed here.
Most of the city’s residents
had fled and survived.
Across the city,
we met families who were
stunned by the destruction.
Haydee Dimalawang had not
seen her home in 10 months.
"This is our vault."
"What was inside the vault?"
"That's money, now nothing. 
It's water."
Reconstruction
will take years.
But Chinese contractors
are already rushing in
with bids to rebuild.
And President Duterte
has shown interest
in what China has to offer.
This cozying up,
experts say, points to
China’s growing influence
in a country that has
been a traditional
U.S. ally in the region.
While governments
around the world
hail the defeat
of ISIS,
for the people here 
who have lost their homes
the fight is not finished.
When they’ll be able to return,
no one really knows.
