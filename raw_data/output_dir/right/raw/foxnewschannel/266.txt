1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:01,174
ANYTHING.

2
00:00:01,175 --> 00:00:01,808
THEY HAVE PROVEN THAT.

3
00:00:01,809 --> 00:00:05,211
HEALTH CARE WOULD BE A DISASTER.

4
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:07,314
STEVE: I KNOW YOU TRAVELED ON

5
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:08,581
AIR FORCE ONE AND ROD ROSENSTEIN

6
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:09,449
WAS ONBOARD.

7
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,185
YOU HAD APPARENTLY A 45-MINUTE

8
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:12,852
CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

9
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,554
YOU WERE GOING DOWN TO ORLANDO

10
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:16,289
FOR THE POLICE CHIEFS

11
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,690
CONFERENCE.

12
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:18,124
APPARENTLY A NUMBER OF

13
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,559
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WANTED TO

14
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,428
HAVE HIM ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY.

15
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,963
THEY WANTED HIM TO BE UNDER OATH

16
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:26,933
AND HE WAS RELUCTANT TO DO THAT

17
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:27,334
REPORTEDLY.

18
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:28,802
WOE HAVE PREFERRED AN INFORMAL

19
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,303
MEETING WITH PERHAPS JUST ONE OR

20
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:33,640
TWO MEMBERS, NOT A WHOLE

21
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:34,007
HEARING.

22
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,810
BUT APPARENTLY YOU KNOW, WE JUST

23
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,011
HAD GREGG JARRETT ON AND HE SAID

24
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:39,713
THAT HE PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO

25
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:40,880
SHOW UP BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT

26
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:41,881
TO BE UNDER OATH.

27
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:43,583
YOU KNOW THE RUMOR IS THE DAY

28
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,452
AFTER THE MIDTERMS YOU'RE GOING

29
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:48,021
TO FIRE HIM AND FIRE THE

30
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:48,521
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

31
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:50,857
>> WELL I ACTUALLY GET ALONG

32
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:52,992
WELL WITH ROD.

33
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:54,427
WE HAVE A WITCH-HUNT GOING ON

34
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:55,695
WHICH IS DISGRACEFUL.

35
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:57,130
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I WILL TAKE

36
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,399
THESE REPUBLICAN GUYS WITH MARK

37
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,935
MEADOWS AND JIM JORDAN AND GATES

38
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,837
AND GIBBS, ALL OF THEM, I HATE

39
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,238
TO MENTION A FEW NAME BECAUSE

40
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,940
THERE ARE SOME OF THEM, I WANT

41
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,508
TO GIVE EVERYONE OF THEM CREDIT.

42
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,343
THESE ARE TOUGH, SMART GUYS.

43
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:12,312
THEY KNOW THERE WAS NO

44
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:12,679
COLLUSION.

45
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,013
IT TURNED OUT WITH RUSSIA.

46
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:15,682
THERE WAS COLLUSION BUT IT WAS

47
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:17,884
WITH HILLARY CLINTON, THE DNC.

48
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,787
I MEAN WHY DIDN'T, AS AN EXAMPLE

49
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:23,256
THE FBI TAKE THE DNC SERVER?

50
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:25,625
THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT.

51
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,560
THEY KNOW WHERE IT IS.

52
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:28,995
THERE IS SO MANY QUESTIONS.

53
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:30,897
ONE THING I'LL SAY THESE

54
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:32,432
REPUBLICAN FOLKS, I THINK

55
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,100
THEY'RE BECOMING FOLK HEROES,

56
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,969
THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT, PEOPLE.

57
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,103
AND THEY WANT TO GET TO THE

58
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:38,004
BOTTOM OF IT.

59
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,473
AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE --

60
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:42,041
STEVE: BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, THE

61
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,743
PEOPLE IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION,

62
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:45,311
ROD ROSENSTEIN, WILL NOT SHOW UP

63
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:49,349
ON CAPITOL HILL TO SPEAK TO

64
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,716
CONGRESS.

65
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:51,151
>> ACTUALLY I WAS SURPRISED AT

66
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,552
THAT I WOULD THINK HE WOULD.

67
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:53,553
HE MENTIONED CERTAIN THINGS TO

68
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:56,956
ME, THAT YOU KNOW ARE VERY

69
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,291
POSITIVE ABOUT THAT EVENT.

70
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,859
I WOULD IMAGINE YOU WOULD WANT

71
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,428
TO PUT THAT DOWN.

72
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:02,395
FRANKLY WHETHER YOU WERE UNDER

73
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,497
OATH OR NOT SHOULDN'T MATTER.

74
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:05,932
BUT HE MENTIONED THINGS TO ME I

75
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,400
WOULD THINK WOULD BE FINE FOR

76
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:08,501
HIM TO TESTIFY.

77
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:12,071
SO YOU KNOW WHEN CONGRESS CALLS.

78
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:14,407
SO I WOULD I'M A LITTLE

79
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,175
SURPRISED ROD WOULDN'T DO IT.

80
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,476
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH

81
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:19,412
ROD BECAUSE WE LOOKWORK ON OTHER

82
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:20,213
THINGS.

83
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:21,481
BRIAN: I HEAR YOU'RE BONDED BY

84
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:24,150
ONE THING, DISTRUST OF ANDY

85
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,852
MCCABE, IS THAT TRUE.

86
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:28,855
>> AND McCABE IS A BAD BUY.

87
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:31,224
COMEY IS A VERY BAD GUY.

88
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,559
THIS COUNTRY GOT LUCKY WHEN I

89
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,093
VOTED FOR HIM.

90
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:36,963
ROD WROTE A MEMO, YOU READ THAT

91
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:38,465
MEMO HOW HORRIBLE COMEY IS.

92
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:39,766
HE IS HORRIBLE GUY AND HE LIED

93
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,468
AND HE LEAKED.

94
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,368
HE LIED BEFORE CONGRESS.

95
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:44,204
HE WAS LEAKING ALL OVER THE

96
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,072
PLACE, NOT ONLY THROUGH HIS

97
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:47,474
PROFESSOR, HIS PROFESSOR FRIEND,

98
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:48,875
TOOK HIS STUFF AND LEAKED

99
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,577
WHATEVER HE WANTED TO DO.

100
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:52,612
COMEY IS A BAD GUY, McCABE,

101
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:54,180
VERY BAD BUT HE WORKED FOR

102
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:54,581
COMEY.

103
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:56,883
REMEMBER ONE THING ABOUT

104
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,151
McCABE, HIS WIFE WAS RUNNING

105
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:02,021
FOR OFFICE AND HE GOT $750,000

106
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,223
FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S

107
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:03,723
ESSENTIALLY PAC.

108
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,059
IT WAS RUN BY TERRY McAULIFFE

109
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,661
WHO IS ABSOLUTELY HILLARY

110
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:09,762
CLINTON'S, ABSOLUTELY HILLARY

111
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,364
CLINTON'S BEST FRIEND AND

112
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:11,798
BILL CLINTON.

113
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,234
THEY GAVE HIM $750,000 FOR HIS

114
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:14,534
WIFE.

115
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,436
NOBODY EVEN KNOWS IF SHE SPENT

116
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:17,337
THE MONEY.

117
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:18,838
SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE SPENT THE

118
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,138
MONEY.

119
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,607
THIS WAS AT THE TIME SHE WAS

120
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:23,810
BEING INVESTIGATED BY McCABE.

121
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:25,378
SO McCABE IS INVESTIGATING

122
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,714
HILLARY CLINTON AND HER PAC,

123
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:29,015
ESSENTIALLY RUN BY HER BEST

124
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:32,118
FRIEND IS PAYING McCABE

125
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:32,485
$750,000.

126
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,554
TO ME THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

127
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,122
NOBODY EVER MENTIONS IT.

128
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:39,092
IT IS REALLY -- LOOK, WE HAVE A

129
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,526
HORNET'S NEST.

130
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:40,894
I THINK I HAVE DONE A GREAT

131
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:42,095
SERVICE FOR THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE

132
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,096
I EXPOSED SO MUCH.

133
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,764
WHEN YOU LOOK AT EMAILS BETWEEN

134
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:47,066
THE TWO LOVERS, STRZOK AND LISA

135
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,035
PAGE, YOU SAY THE INSURANCE

136
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:50,336
POLICY, THEY'RE SO WANTING TO

137
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:51,905
WIN AGAINST TRUMP, BUT THEN IN A

138
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,740
MOMENT OF SILENCE THEY SAID,

139
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,742
WELL, IF THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

140
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,277
WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY.

141
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,145
WELL THE INSURANCE POLICY IS

142
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:02,248
WHAT HAS GONE ON FOR THE LAST

143
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:03,416
FAIRLY LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

144
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,852
THERE WAS TREMENDOUS CORRUPTION,

145
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,687
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THESE

146
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,889
PEOPLE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM

147
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,256
OF IT.

148
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:11,824
AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE LIKE

149
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,927
DEVIN NUNEZ, HE SHOULD GET, IF

150
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:15,962
THIS ALL TURNS OUT LIKE EVERYONE

151
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,897
THINKS IT WILL, DEVIN NUNEZ

152
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:20,066
SHOULD GET THE MEDAL OF HONOR.

153
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,035
HE IS REALLY, WHAT HE HAS GONE

154
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:23,503
THROUGH AND HIS BRAVERY.

155
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:26,773
HE SHOULD GET A VERY IMPORTANT

156
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:27,073
MEDAL.

157
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:28,875
MAYBE WE'LL CALL IT MEDAL OF

158
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,276
FREEDOM BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY GIVE

159
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:31,978
THEM, HIGH AWARD FOR CIVILIANS.

160
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,714
HE HAS DONE AN AMAZING, GUYS

161
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:37,584
LIKE MEADOWS AND JIM JORDAN, ALL

162
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:39,686
OF THESE PEOPLE, WHAT THEY, WHAT

163
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,254
THEY GO THROUGH AND THEY'RE

164
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:41,788
RIGHT.

165
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:42,789
AND THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY

166
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,657
THEY'RE BEING STYMIED AT SO MANY

167
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:45,358
DIFFERENT LEVELS.

168
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,859
BUT NOW IT IS COMING OUT AND

169
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,227
IT'S A REALLY SAD.

170
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,796
I DID A GREAT SERVICE FOR THIS

171
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:54,300
COUNTRY WHEN I FIRED COMEY.

172
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,035
WEIGH AS BAD GUY WITH BAD

173
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:56,436
INTENTIONS.

174
00:04:56,437 --> 00:04:58,438
YOU LOOK AT THE WAY HE

175
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,073
HANDLED -- ONE THING JUST TO

176
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:01,007
FINISH UP ON THAT.

177
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,276
YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS HATED

178
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,278
COMEY MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING.

179
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,279
HE ACTUALLY DID HILLARY CLINTON

180
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,580
A BIG FAVOR BECAUSE SHE SHOULD

181
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:09,115
BE IN JAIL, THEY SHOULD HAVE

182
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:11,284
TAKEN HER RIGHT OFF THE CAMPAIGN

183
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:13,252
BUT, SO HE DID HER A BIG FAVOR.

184
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:16,089
BUT DEMOCRATS HATED COMEY, HATED

185
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,356
HIM.

186
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,926
I SAID ONE THING IS, I SAID I

187
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,494
WOULD GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

188

NUCLEAR TESTING, NO NOTHING.

260
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:14,841
WE'VE COVERED A LOT.

THERE WASN'T A UNITED STATES

333
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:02,582

00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:02,775
WE HAVE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND

375
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,076
INCREDIBLE TALENT WORKING ON IT.

376
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,278
WE DON'T LIKE IT.

377
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,779
I DON'T LIKE IT.

378
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,113
NO GOOD.

379
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:08,147
AINSLEY: MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME

380
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:10,483
ASK YOU ABOUT THE MIDTERMS,

381
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,484
HISTORICALLY ARE YOU WORRIED

382
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,185
ABOUT PEOPLE STAYING HOME FOR

383
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:15,254
THE MIDTERMS AND WHICH STATES DO

384
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,155
YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN?

385
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,257
>> SO MANY PEOPLE SAYING I WISH

386
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:23,863
YOU WERE RUNNING I WOULD BE

387
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:24,196
VOTING.

388
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:27,133
I SAID DO ME A FAVOR, GO OUT AND

389
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:29,068
VOTE, I SAY AT MY RALLIES, GO

390
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,103
OUT AND VOTE.

391
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:32,271
HISTORICALLY WHOEVER WINS THE

392
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:33,839
PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW BETTER THAN

393
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,775
ANYBODY, THEY DON'T DO WELL IN

394
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:36,142
MIDTERMS.

395
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:37,343
I THINK IS DIFFERENT, THE

396
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,045
ECONOMY IS BEST IT HAS EVER BEEN

397
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:39,345
EVER.

398
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:40,513
THIS IS THE STRONGEST ECONOMY WE

399
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,480
EVER HAD.

400
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,349
WE TALKED ABOUT JOBS BEFORE, IT

401
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,250
IS THE BEST.

402
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,052
I REALLY THINK PEOPLE WILL GO

403
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:46,319
IT.

404
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,720
I REALLY THINK JUSTICE

405
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:51,857
KAVANAUGH, THE WAY HE WAS

406
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,426
TREATED SO BADLY, THIS IS FINE

407
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,161
MAN WHAT THEY DID TO HIM THE

408
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:55,995
DEMOCRATS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

409
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:57,697
WILL FORGET THAT SO QUICKLY.

410
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,898
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY SHORT

411
00:10:58,899 --> 00:10:59,966
PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THE

412
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,366
MIDTERMS.

413
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:01,534
I THINK WE'LL DO VERY WELL.

414
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,803
I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE SENATE

415
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,271
RACES THAT WE WEREN'T EVEN GOING

416
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:08,641
TO CONTEST, THAT WERE WE'RE

417
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:09,375
ACTUALLY LEADING IN.

418
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:10,343
I COULD MENTION NAMES.

419
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,511
I WON'T, MAYBE I MENTION ONE OR

420
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:13,679
TWO.

421
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:13,980
HEIDI.

422
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:16,248
HEIDI WAS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW,

423
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,351
WIN WE HAVE A, WE HAVE A MAN,

424
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:21,153
NORTH DAKOTA, WE HAVE A MAN WHO

425
00:11:21,154 --> 00:11:23,556
IS FANTASTIC AND WE ASKED HIM TO

426
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,725
RUN, THE MOST POPULAR, HE IS

427
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,160
JUST A GREAT, GREAT PERSON.

428
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:29,395
BRIAN: KEVIN CRAMER.

429
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,697
>> KEVIN IS JUST A GREAT PERSON.

430
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,533
HE IS RUNNING UP LIKE 13 POINTS.

431
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:36,102
STEVE: RIGHT.

432
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:38,804
>> PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO GET OUT

433
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:39,305
AND VOTE.

434
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,374
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.

435
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,942
ON MANY SENATE RACES, RACES WE

436
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,377
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE, WE'LL DO

437
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:50,316
AT LEAST VERY WELL, IN MANY CASE

438
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,417
IS I THINK WE'LL WIN.

439
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:54,153
WITH THE HOUSE MANY CASES PEOPLE

440
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:55,087
WILL CALL RUN.

441
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,989
I REALLY THINK REPUBLICANS ARE

442
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,491
ENERGIZED, MUCH MORE SO NOW THAN

443
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,292
TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO.

444
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:01,827
STEVE: MR. PRESIDENT, A NEW

445
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:02,828
"QUNNIPIAC POLL" CAME OUT THIS

446
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,096
MORNING WHAT HAD BEEN A TIGHT

447
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:07,233
RACE DOWN IN TEXAS BETWEEN CRUZ

448
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,667
AND O'ROURKE, CRUZ OPENED IT UP,

449
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:12,638
HE IS NOW AT 54%.

450
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,906
MR. O'ROURKE IS AT 45.

451
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,207
HE IS AHEAD BY NINE.

452
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,176
YOU'RE RIGHT, I THINK YOUR BASE

453
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:19,545
RIGHT NOW, IF LAST NIGHT'S RALLY

454
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:21,514
WERE ANY INDICATION, THEY'RE

455
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:22,748
ENERGIZED BUT THE BIG QUESTION,

456
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:25,184
SIR, HOW DO YOU KEEP THAT ENERGY

457
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:25,451
UP?

458
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,286
HOW DO YOU KEEP THE REPUBLICANS

459
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,555
AND THE RIGHT-LEANING

460
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,023
INDEPENDENTS, THE ENERGY UP SO

461
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:32,558
THEY WILL VOTE FOR YOUR SIDE?

462
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,293
>> WELL I REALLY THINK THEY HAVE

463
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,929
IT NATURALLY, I REALLY DO AND

464
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,198
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT EVEN

465
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:39,965
BEFORE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, IF YOU

466
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,534
LOOK AT OVER THE LAST MONTH OR

467
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:42,234
TWO MONTH.

468
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,636
I DIDN'T BELIEVE THE POLLS

469
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,637
BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAVE

470
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,204
TREMENDOUS ENERGY.

471
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:47,206
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS HAVE

472
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:47,873
TREMENDOUS ENERGY.

473
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:50,076
THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR

474
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:53,579
401(k)S REALLY GOOD.

475
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:01,687
THEY'RE UP40 OR 50% IN

476
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:02,021
401(k)S.

477
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:05,558
THEY NEVER HAD IT.

478
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,526
STEVE: YESTERDAY WAS A BAD DAY

479
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:08,160
FOR INVESTORS.

480
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,328
>> THAT'S FINE.

481
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,963
FEDERAL RESERVE IS GETTING A

482
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,498
LITTLE TOO CUTE, THAT'S ALL.

483
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,666
THAT IS RED INCLUDES WHAT

484
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,500
THEY'RE DOING.

485
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:15,868
DEMOCRATS LOOK WHAT THEY WOULD

486
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:16,635
DO TO IT.

487
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:17,937
THEY WOULD KNOCK IT DOWN,

488
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,505
INSTEAD OF UP 50% YOU WOULD BE

489
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,039
DOWN 50%.

490
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,607
WHEN I TOOK OVER THIS ECONOMY,

491
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:23,476
THIS ECONOMY WAS READY TO CRASH.

492
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,878
WE WERE AT 1% GDP.

493
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,080
NOW WE'RE AT 4.2%.

494
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:29,148
IT WAS READY TO CRASH.

495
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,550
IT WAS THE WORST, IF YOU LOOK

496
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,586
FROM DEPRESSION, FROM THE GREAT

497
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,454
DEPRESSION, IT WAS THE WORST

498
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,556
RECOVERY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

499
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,124
COUNTRY.

500
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,391
AND OBAMA THREW TREMENDOUS MONEY

501
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:40,259
AT IT.

502
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,827
DON'T FORGET OBAMA WAS PLAYING

503
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:42,928
WITH ZERO MONEY.

504
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:46,098
SO HE WAS PLAYING WITH FUNNY

505
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:46,398
MONEY.

506
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,001
HE WAS, IT WAS VERY EASY.

507
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,402
I'M PAYING INTEREST AT A HIGH

508
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:51,337
RATE BECAUSE OF OUR FED.

509
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:52,771
AND I WOULD LIKE OUR FED NOT TO

510
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:54,607
BE SOING A AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE I

511
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,242
THINK THEY'RE MAKING A BIG

512
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:57,877
MISTAKE BUT I'M, I'M PLAYING

513
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,512
WITH, YOU KNOW, WITH MONEY THAT

514
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:00,880
WE PAY INTEREST.

515
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,716
NOW THAT IS GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH

516
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,417
MONEY IN THE BANK AND NOW THEY

517
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:06,719
CAN GET INTEREST ON THEIR MONEY

518
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,988
FOR FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME

519
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:10,389
BUT IT IS GOOD IN CERTAIN WAYS

520
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,790
BUT THEY'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

521
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,092
THEY'RE BEING TOO AGGRESSIVE.

522
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,393
BRIAN: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

523
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,228
CHINA, IF WE CAN, WE WERE STRUCK

524
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:18,497
WHEN ONE OF OUR BATTLESHIPS CAME

525
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:19,999
WITHIN 45 YARDS OF A CHINESE

526
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,300
SHIP AND WE HAD TO BACK OUT.

527
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:22,935
THEY ARE EXTREMELY DISTURBED

528
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,103
ABOUT YOURING A AGGRESSIVE

529
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,337
STANCE WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE

530
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:27,039
AND THEY'RE STEALING OF

531
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,441
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM OUR

532
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:30,009
PEOPLE.

533
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,544
WE'RE COMING TO LOGGERHEADS WITH

534
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:33,279
THAT FELLOW SUPERPOWER.

535
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,147
WHERE IS THAT HEADING AND IS

536
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:37,149
THIS ALL HANDS ON DECK WITH THE

537
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,717
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ALONG WITH

538
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:40,986
THE TREASURY ON THE SAME PAGE TO

539
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:42,521
STOP THEM AS THEY LOOK TO EXPAND

540
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,389
AROUND THE GLOBE?

541
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,492
>> WELL SURE, BUT YOU STOP THEM

542
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:46,959
ECONOMICALLY.

543
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,994
LOOK, CHINA WAS TAKING OUT

544
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,796
$500 BILLION A YEAR,

545
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:52,031
500 BILLION, BRIAN, A YEAR.

546
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:53,632
I SAID IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

547
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:54,500
ANY LONGER.

548
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,901
I DIDN'T GO INITIALLY BECAUSE

549
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,536
THEY HAVE HELPED US AND I

550
00:14:57,537 --> 00:14:58,871
BELIEVE THEY'RE CONTINUING TO

551
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:01,140
HELP US WITH NORTH KOREA BECAUSE

552
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:02,308
93% OF THE STUFF GOES THROUGH

553
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:04,243
CHINA TO GET INTO NORTH KOREA.

554
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:06,879
THROUGH THEIR BORDER.

555
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,716
CHINA HAS BEEN QUITE GOOD.

556
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,551
THEY COULD BE BETTER BUT THEY'RE

557
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:13,953
QUITE GOOD WHAT WE'RE DOING IN

558
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,521
NORTH KOREA IS AMAZING BY THE

559
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:16,922
WAY ACCORDING TO EVERYBODY.

560
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:18,390
SO WITH CHINA I SAID YOU CAN'T

561
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:20,359
DO THIS YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO

562
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,493
TAKE THIS MONEY OUT.

563
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:23,696
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE

564
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:25,631
OF BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, PRESIDENT

565
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:25,931
BUSH.

566
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:27,299
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF

567
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,068
BY MANY OTHER PRESIDENTS.

568
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:30,236
THEY LET CHINA GET OUT OF

569
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,738
CONTROL AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO

570
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,440
PAY $500 BILLION A YEAR TO CHINA

571
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:35,641
AND REBUILD CHINA.

572
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,409
WE HAVE HELPED REBUILD CHINA

573
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,178
MORE THAN ANY OTHER FACTOR.

574
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,447
WE HAVE HELPED REBUILD IT.

575
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,015
I SAID IT'S OVER.

576
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:44,250
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY.

577
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:45,985
THEY CAN'T BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

578
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,885
THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH THE

579
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:48,354
EUROPEAN UNION, I TOLD THEM THE

580
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,389
SAME THING THE THEY DON'T TAKE

581
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,525
OUR PRODUCT AND YET THEIR

582
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:56,595
MERCEDES-BENZS AND BMWs IN TO

583
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:57,229
SEE US.

584
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,464
THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH CHINA.

585
00:15:58,465 --> 00:15:59,865
THAT'S THE BIG ONE.

586
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:00,899
THAT'S THE REAL BIG ONE.

587
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,535
THEY'RE TAKING OUT $500 BILLION

588
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,704
AND NOW I PUT $250 BILLION WORTH

589
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:09,608
OF TAXES OR TARIFFS ON CHINA AND

590
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:12,711
IT HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT WHEN YOU

591
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,680
LOOK AT THEIR.

592
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:15,214
STEVE: WHAT'S NEXT?

593
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:16,982
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR ECONOMY,

594
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:18,250
A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME.

595
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:20,519
THEIR ECONOMY HAS GONE DOWN VERY

596
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,953
SUBSTANTIALLY.

597
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,054
I HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO IF I

598
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,055
WANT TO DO IT.

599
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:24,490
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT THEY

600
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:25,224
HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE.

601
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,192
I WILL TELL YOU THIS, AND I'VE

602
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:29,628
SAID IT, ACTUALLY I SAID IT LAST

603
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,764
NIGHT TO SHANNON, I WILL TELL

604
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,065
YOU THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE.

605
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,733
THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE BADLY BUT

606
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,869
I TOLD THEM YOU'RE NOT READY

607
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,136
YET.

608
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,003
YOU'RE NOT READY YET.

609
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:40,739
THEY LIVED TOO WELL FOR TOO LONG

610
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,275
AND FRANKLY I GUESS THEY THINK

611
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:45,277
THAT THE AMERICANS ARE STUPID

612
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:45,711
PEOPLE.

613
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,680
AMERICANS ARE NOT STUPID PEOPLE.

614
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,515
WE WERE LED BADLY WHEN IT CAME

615
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:50,249
TO TRADE.

616
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,384
THAT INCLUDES WITH MEXICO, WHICH

617
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:55,220
WE'VE SOLVED, IT INCLUDES WITH

618
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,388
CANADA, IT INCLUDES WITH

619
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,755
EVERYBODY.

620
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,490
ONE BY ONE WE'RE KNOCKING THEM

621
00:16:58,491 --> 00:16:58,791
OFF.

622
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,192
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

623
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,760
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE

624
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,629
HAVE SUCH POTENTIAL IN OUR

625
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,464
COUNTRY BECAUSE WE WERE, WE WERE

626
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,898
DOING THIS WITH THESE HORRIBLE

627
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,267
TRADE DEALS.

628
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:10,135
FRANKLY WITH HORRIBLE MILITARY

629
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:13,572
DEALS WHERE WE PROTECT WEALTHY

630
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,140
COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN AND

631
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,376
SAUDI ARABIA AND SOUTH KOREA.

632
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:18,477
THEY DON'T PAY US.

633
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:19,311
IT IS RIDICULOUS.

634
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:20,812
WE'RE PROTECTING THE WORLD AND

635
00:17:20,814 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON'T PAY US.
