Tucker: AND JUDGING BY ELECTION RESULTS ACROSS COUNTRY, THIS COULD BE A VERY TOUGH FALL FOR IT REPUBLICANS. THIS YEAR IT COULD BE WORSE THAN USUAL FOR A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT REASONS, BUT ONE OF THOSE REASONS MAY BE AT THE REPUBLICANS ARE RUNNING ON ENTIRELY THE WRONG ISSUES. YOUR AVERAGE REPUBLICAN OFFICEHOLDERS SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT MOST AMERICANS LOVE MASS IMMIGRATION. THEY SAY THAT ALL THE TIME. IT TURNS OUT, IT'S NOT TRUE. BIG REPUBLICAN DONORS LOVE NEST IMMIGRATION, AND SO TO CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS, IT INCREASES THE SIZE OF THEIR PARTY. CONSIDER THE NEW CVS U GOD OF POLE. FAR MORE IMMIGRATION THINKS IT'S MAKING IMMIGRATION WORSE AND NOT BETTER. 45% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN SAY IMMIGRATION IS HURTING THEM AND ONLY 17% SAY HE IS HELPING. HOW ABOUT HISPANICS, WHERE ARE THEY ON THIS? REPUBLICAN CONSULTANTS TELL YOU AND THEY TELL THEIR CANDIDATES NEVER TO SAY A NEGATIVE WORD ABOUT IMMIGRATION FOR FEAR OF ALIENATING HISPANIC VOTERS. TURNS OUT THAT'S IDIOTIC AND PATRONIZING AND ACTUALLY 44% OF HISPANIC VOTERS SAY IMMIGRATION IS HURTING THEIR COMMUNITIES. JUST 28% SAY HE IS IMPROVING THINGS. THE NUMBERS COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. IMMIGRATION IS A POWERFUL ISSUE FOR AMERICANS OF ALL KINDS, AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT REPUBLICANS CAN WIN ON IF ONLY THEY WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO VOTERS. BUT, THEY ARE NOT. AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF TOTAL CONTROL OF CONGRESS, NO WALL IS BEING BUILT, CITIES ARE BEING WELL FUNDED, CHAIN MIGRATION IS ALIVE AND WELL. NOTHING IS HAPPENING. NOW THAT THE MEDIA IS TELLING YOU IT'S IMMORAL TO SEPARATE IMMIGRANT PARENTS WITH THEIR CHILDREN, LOTS OF REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT. BUT WAIT AMERICANS WHO GET ARRESTED ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN. AMERICAN CITIZEN SHOULD BE TREATED MORE HARSHLY THAN ILLEGAL ALIENS? HOW IS THAT? HERE'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THE SUBJECT. WATCH THIS. WE BELIEVE EVERY PERSON WHO ENTERS THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY LIKE THAT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED AND YOU CAN'T GIVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO PEOPLE WHO ARE BRINGING CHILDREN WITH THEM. IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN, THEY SHOULD NOT BRING THEM WITH THEM. Tucker: WHEN YOU HEAR JEFF SESSIONS CRITICIZE A LOT FOR A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT ON THIS ISSUE, HE IS THE ONLY PERSON IN WASHINGTON WERE STILL ARGUING THAT BORDERS AND LAWS MATTER. TO BE THE REST OF THIS PARTY WILL WAKE UP AND REALIZE THEY DO. LOU DOBBS JOINS US TONIGHT. YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ISSUE MORE DEEPLY THAN ALMOST ANYBODY I KNOW. DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU THAT NO ONE HAS PAUSE TO ASK, WAIT A SECOND, IF IT'S WRONG FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE KIDS WHEN THEY COMMIT A CRIME, WHY IS IT NOT WRONG FOR AMERICAN CITIZENS TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR KIDS? THERE ARE PREDICTIVE GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, THEY ARE A PREFERRED GROUP. IT IS SO BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, U.S. MULTINATIONALS, THEY WANT CHEAPER LABOR, THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS AND THEY WANT TO QUOTE UNQUOTE HARMONIZE THOSE BORDERS. YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT THE NORTH AMERICAN UNION ANYMORE, BUT UNDER GEORGE BUSH AND THROUGH MOST OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE NORTH AMERICAN UNION, THAT IS, BRINGING CANADA AND MEXICO TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES, WAS THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL. THEY JUST HAD TO BACK OFF BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS THAT YOU JUST SHOWED IN THAT POLL. THE REALITY IS, AMERICANS UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING. WHATEVER THE RACE, WHATEVER THE, WHATEVER THE SOCIOECONOMIC DICING YOU WANT TO DO WITH THE NUMBERS, AMERICANS KNOW WHEN THEY ARE BEING LIED TO AND THEY CAN FEEL THE REALITY. THE REALITY IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS BECAUSE WE IN THE LAST MONTH JUST RETURNED TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDERS. Tucker: IT SO INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS, DEMOCRATS WILL TELL YOU, THE MEDIA TELLS YOU AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THEY ARE RACIST, THEY ARE BIGOTS. LESS THAN 20% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN SAY IMMIGRATION HAS MADE THEIR COMMUNITIES BETTER. THEY ARE NOT FORWARDED. HISPANIC AMERICANS, SAME THING. SO, IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT BIGOTRY, ACTUALLY. BECAUSE THIS CUTS ACROSS RACES. ABSOLUTELY. AND OF COURSE THE ENTIRE LEFT WING AND ESTABLISHMENT ARGUMENT COLLAPSES IF PEOPLE LOOK AT THE REALITY. THE REALITY IS, AND ALL OF THOSE ETHNOCENTRIC INTEREST GROUPS AND ACTIVIST GROUPS ARE BASICALLY SPEWING PROPAGANDA. THEY HAVE IT'S ALL BEEN PICKED UP BY THE NATIONAL LEFT-WING MEDIA SUPPORTED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT AND CORPORATE AMERICA. OBVIOUSLY, TO THE DETRIMENT OF WORKING MEN AND WOMEN, PARTICULARLY AT THE LOWEST PAYING LEVELS IN THE LOWEST SKILL LEVELS, LOWEST EDUCATION LEVELS IN THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF PEOPLE CROSSING THAT BORDER AS THE PRESIDENT IS MADE CLEAR THROUGHOUT AND IT'S NOT COMING ACROSS ON THE BASIS OF MARRIAGE. THEY ARE COMING ACROSS ON THE BASIS OF MEXICAN GOVERNMENT POLICY WHICH INSIST THAT THEY BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES TO BE THE LEAST ADVANTAGED AMONG SOCIETY. I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WHEN WE WORKED AT ANOTHER NETWORK AND PEOPLE LAUGHED AT YOU AND IT TURNED OUT, YOU ARE COMPLETELY RIGHT. THAT MUST FRUSTRATE YOU. WHILE THEY STILL LAUGH A LITTLE BIT I HOPE BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT THE REALITY THAT IS AMERICAN POLITICS. WE JUST ELECTED A PRESIDENT IN 2016 THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THESE ISSUES AND THE IDIOT ESTABLISHMENTS ARE TELLING THE REPUBLIC AND PARTY THEY SHOULD RUN ON TAX CUTS INSTEAD OF ON TRAY TO COME ON JOBS, ON MARKETS THAT ARE IMPROVING, AND, THE
