Sacramento California has been making headlines for police brutality for quite some time and more recently a young man by the name of Stephon Clark was wrongfully shot and killed by police in the area now they had mistook him for a burglary suspect a car burglary suspect they ran ran after him into his own backyard and then proceeded to fire bullets in his direction an independent autopsy conducted the family's request showed that Clark was shot six times in the back in the back so he was running away from the cops but he was innocent he was unarmed he was not guilty of any type of crime or charged with any kind of crime yet a cell phone isn't that what they say he had a cell phone and cops believe that that cell phone was a gun but again an innocent human being who did not deserve to get shot and people were wondering well is the District Attorney going to bring charges against the cops who were involved in this case well according to this incredible reporting by Shawn King if you see some of the financial influences that drive the district attorney in Sacramento California you'll understand why she wouldn't bring charges against these cops now before we get to the details of this story I want to show you the video of you know what happened with Stephon Clark this is difficult to watch so I want to give you warning but with that said take a look so the district attorney is anne-marie Schubert and if you thought the case involving Stefan Clark is despicable wait till you hear of some of the other instances of police brutality where anne-marie Schubert did not bring any charges now she has consistently according to reporting by Shawn King in the intercept consistently declined to file charges of any kind in instances of police shooting and killing black men in Sacramento okay now let's take a look at the numbers who is funding her campaigns according to an analysis by the intercept about one-third of the contribution she received across her two campaigns to be Sacramento County's district attorney one of which is currently ongoing came from law enforcement sources or those close to law enforcement for the three campaigns she raised money for Schubert has taken in well over 1 million in disclosed contributions of that money about four hundred twenty thousand dollars came from law enforcement groups or people associated with law enforcement including two hundred thousand a two hundred thousand dollar loan from a former official with the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department a law enforcement associations political action committee also independently spent more than fifty thousand dollars on her first campaign for District Attorney that brings the total amount of law enforcement cash spent on Schubert's election efforts to around four hundred seventy thousand dollars so all of that would make one believe that there is a corrupting influence here but what about the amount of money that was donated to her right after the shooting of Stefon Clarke days after Clarke was killed she actually came under fire for receiving two campaign donations from local law enforcement sources the California statewide statewide law enforcement Association gave $10,000 to her reelection campaign the Sacramento County alliance of law enforcement made a three thousand dollar tribution of their own again these contributions were made days following the shooting of Stephan Clark this is the problem with money in politics this is the problem with a system so awash in money that it's unable to see clearly a situation that should represent the people's right to things being adjudicated two things being investigated two things being resolved in an inequitable way what you end up with is so much money in the system that it would cloud it although this doesn't even appear cloudy it really does look as though it's pay-to-play I mean as as Anna says look leaning toward law enforcement is probably something that government does generally but this appears to be bought and and and sold by by law enforcement it's just heartbreaking because remember these are the law enforcement officials who are supposed to protect us and the district attorney is supposed to hold cops accountable for using excessive force I mean if if they're in cahoots with police organizations and if there is this corrupting factor within the District Attorney's Office there is absolutely no hope of real justice being served so yeah that's the people's district attorney I think they Anna's making a very important point the district attorney's office is your advocate you know against some big institutions like the cops the cops make mistakes doesn't mean that they went out to go shoot a guy dead but still when that happens there has to be an independent investigation and the independence would appear lost as I say and there's a wash that this wash of money and you know these types of shootings based on the data and the evidence that we have disproportionately impact minorities disproportionately impact black men but the reality is none of us are safe from this type of excessive force and and brutality if we allow for this type of corruption to take place in our system of justice we essentially end up having an in justice system now again the Stephan Clark story is gut-wrenching but it's just one story in a history of injustice in Sacramento County let me give you another example so two years before Clarke was killed police shot and killed a mentally ill homeless man named Joseph man police tried to run him over with their car on a dash cam reporting an officer could be heard saying quote I'm going to hit him his partner responded okay go for it now the cops in this instance argued that man was charging at them mind you they're in a police vehicle so even if a mentally ill homeless man was charging at them they're still in a car how much of a threat could he possibly serve but an investigation determined that he actually did not charge at them his feet were Impe is like stuck in position yeah they claim that he were had was leaping at them but yeah and so that's why his feet were very germane to the investigation where they were exactly now the Sacramento News Review outlined several cases in which Schubert has been unwilling to take on police noting that her office has quote prosecuted more activists for civil disobedience than she has officers involved in misconduct and just in case it wasn't already abundantly clear no charges were brought against the police officers who attempted to run over man just Joseph man it's just it's incredible and you you look at all these you know specific stories and all of these cases of brutality and the district attorney did nothing and why would she a huge chunk of her funding comes from police organizations yeah again you just feel as though she's been sold you know and sold to law enforcement in this case and and and it makes an important point about like all of us out there anything could happen in the fever on an adrenaline associated with a lot of law enforcement situations not all law enforcement people are created equal and so you end up with the highly trained law enforcement officers who we asked to do a lot who deescalate situations who work on the on the notion that they should have restraint and work to deescalate and you have others who get caught up in that adrenaline and and in that fever and bad things happen in any case in the case of error in the case of legitimate misdeeds or aggression of the sort that Hanna just talked about with the with the the cops taking out the mentally mentally ill homeless man you need an independent investigation and that's what you're counting on from the people's attorney and in this case the people's attorney's office appears to have been sold again and I've made this point before but I really want to emphasize it and drive at home a lot of people can't understand why someone who's innocent like Stefan Clark would run away from cops as they approach him well if all of these shootings keep happening and innocent people keep getting shot and killed and there's no justice following that wouldn't you be scared too would you be trusting of the cops wouldn't you want to run away I mean it's a life-or-death situation in a lot of cases unfortunately he lost his life and again he didn't do anything wrong he wasn't the burglary suspect yeah that's a look you hear out the conversations that black families are having with their kids about how to talk to a police officer what to do if you're stopped how to comport yourself and I think if you're not a person of color it's hard to relate to that I mean you think God I mean you understand it but really thinking that it could be a life death situation every time you have an interaction with law enforcement that's something that those of us who are not people of color really don't have a window on so what Anna's talking about is I think it's a it's a real scare that families in this country are facing in in communities that you'd think wouldn't be problems I mean I don't understand why Sacramento has this issue it's it's pretty devastating and I also want to emphasize that it seems like in various situations the person who's dealing with the cops can't win because you think of falando Casteel and how he did comply and and cooperate with the cop in that situation he was deferential even exactly and he still got shot and his girlfriends in the car with him also complying listening to the cop remaining calm even after her boyfriend was shot and killed right in front of her and they still put her in handcuffs after that so you have to put yourself in other people's shoes and understand the gravity of this situation you have to understand the gravity of the corruption and how it leads to injustice and if you want another specific example of this District Attorney refusing to do her job because she's bought by police interests in this case apparently there was a California state auditor who demanded that she file misdemeanor charges against the sheriff who apparently this district attorney is in cahoots with now the sheriff is Scott Jones Scott Jones is a pretty shady individual and according to the report let's go to graphic thirteen on December 19th of 2017 California state auditor Elaine Howell sent a letter to Schubert urging her to prosecute Jones that's the sheriff Jones according to the auditor who serves in a watchdog capacity had committed a misdemeanor offense by deliberately releasing information that he was specifically told he could not release despite multiple verbal and written warnings well guess what Jones did not have to deal with any charges a pack called Friends of Sheriff Scott Jones had donated to her campaigns and every story has a footnote like that every story and by the way in that case she could have written she should have recused herself because she obviously has a very cozy relationship with the sheriff you know financially speaking I don't mean anything else and instead of recusing herself Schubert announced that she would be ignoring the auditor's request to file charges against Jones well she should be there should be recusal on any number of cases I mean it appears just for the reasons that you're saying and it that all this money is pouring into a reelection campaign she should be recusing herself left and right I mean she should just stay in her office and you know we'll call her when we need her instead she's the last word on whether these cases go to prosecution I want people in Sacramento to keep in mind that she has an elected position and I know that it's it's hard to keep track of everything that's going on all the different candidates but oftentimes incumbents don't deal with challenges and we need the voters to rise up and elect her out of the position she is corrupt she has no interest in justice and she has no no reason to be in that position if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy
