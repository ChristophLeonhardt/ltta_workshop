1
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:04,583
>> Bret: FULL COVERAGE OF THAT

2
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:05,084
HEARING TOMORROW.

3
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:05,418
THANKS.

4
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:07,686
A SHORT TIME AGO I TALKED WITH

5
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:09,722
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S ATTORNEY, BETH

6
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:11,891
WILKINSON.

7
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,292
>> Bret: THERE ARE NO CALLS,

8
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:15,828
NOT ONLY THE SENATE MINORITY

9
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:16,529
LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, BUT ALL

10
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:17,196
TEN DEMOCRATS ON THE SENATE

11
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:19,031
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ARE CALLING

12
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:21,034
FOR KAVANAUGH TO WITHDRAW HIS

13
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:21,434
NOMINATION.

14
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:23,770
IS HE CONSIDERING THAT AT ALL?

15
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,737
>> NO, HE'S NOT.

16
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:25,605
AND IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT

17
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,808
IT'S COME TO THIS TODAY.

18
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:33,346
I'M SHOCKED BY THE ALLEGATIONS,

19
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:34,047
EXTRAORDINARY THAT THEY WERE

20
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:34,948
JUST DROPPED ON THE PUBLIC TODAY

21
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:35,515
AND ON THE COMMITTEE.

22
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:40,386
IF YOU READ THOSE ALLEGATIONS,

23
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:41,354
THEY MEAN THAT TENS AND TENS OF

24
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,790
MEN AND WOMEN WERE INVOLVED WITH

25
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,625
GANG RAPE AND BINGE DRINKING AND

26
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,627
NO ONE REPORTED IT AND NO ONE

27
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:48,261
REPORTED THAT SINCE JUDGE

28
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:50,563
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN IN THIS

29
00:00:50,563 --> 00:00:50,897
PROCESS.

30
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:52,465
IF THIS ALLEGATION HAS MERIT, I

31
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:53,500
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HER

32
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,601
ATTORNEY DIDN'T BRING IT FORWARD

33
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,335
BEFORE AND WHY HE HASN'T GONE TO

34
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:57,203
THE POLICE.

35
00:00:57,203 --> 00:00:57,937
>> Bret: THE DEMOCRATS ARE

36
00:00:57,937 --> 00:00:58,605
SAYING WHY NOT JUST PUT THE

37
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:02,509
BRAKES ON EVERYTHING UNTIL THE

38
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,711
FBI TO REOPEN THIS BACKGROUND

39
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,245
INVESTIGATION?

40
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:05,912
>> THAT'S UP TO THE SENATE

41
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:07,647
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

42
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:08,715
>> Bret: THEY SAY IT'S UP TO

43
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:09,749
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

44
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:10,517
>> IT'S REALLY NOT.

45
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:12,552
IF THE SENATE IS IN CHARGE OF

46
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:13,353
THIS PROCESS.

47
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:14,120
THEY RUN THE INVESTIGATION, THEY

48
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,356
RUN THE HEARING.

49
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,224
HE HAS SAID WHAT HE KNOWS, WHICH

50
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,160
IS HE ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T DO THIS.

51
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,361
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THIS WOMAN

52
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:23,530
AND HE HAS SUBMITTED HIMSELF TO

53
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,497
QUESTIONS UNDER THE PENALTY OF

54
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:26,699
PERJURY OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

55
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:27,834
HE SAID REPEATEDLY HE'S NEVER

56
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,303
ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF CONDUCT.

57
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:32,439
AND I WONDER WHY THESE PEOPLE

58
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,640
DIDN'T COME FORWARD WHEN JUDGE

59
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,307
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN IN THE

60
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:35,976
LIMELIGHT FOR MONTHS.

61
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,243
MONTHS AND IF THEY THOUGHT THESE

62
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:39,245
ALLEGATIONS HAD ANY MERIT THEY

63
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:40,380
SHOULD HAVE COME FORWARD BEFORE

64
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,181
AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLENTY

65
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,082
OF TIME TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT

66
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,917
TO DO.

67
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,185
BUT YOU HAVE TO QUESTION THE

68
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,553
MOTIVES WHEN THEY COME FORWARD

69
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:47,854
WITH THE MOST SALACIOUS, MOST

70
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:49,389
OUTRAGEOUS ALLEGATIONS THE DAY

71
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,725
BEFORE THE HEARING.

72
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:52,525
>> Bret: SENATOR FLAKE SAID

73
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,560
TODAY ON A SPEECH ON THE SENATE

74
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,362
FLOOR THAT NO MATTER WHAT

75
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,364
HAPPENS, EVEN IF THEY GET TO A

76
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:59,566
"YES" AND NO VOTE, THAT THIS IS

77
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,233
GOING TO HAVE SOME DOUBTS

78
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,868
SURROUNDING IT.

79
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,837
>> I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING

80
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,939
BECAUSE THIS PROCESS, WHAT IT'S

81
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:06,539
BECOME SO DEMEANING AND

82
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:08,375
DEGRADING FOR OUR COUNTRY.

83
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,643
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD

84
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:11,711
EVER WANT TO PUT THEIR NAME IN

85
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:12,979
THE HAT FOR PUBLIC OFFICE

86
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:13,713
ANYMORE IF WE ARE GOING TO DO

87
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,781
THIS FOR PEOPLE.

88
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,384
I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A

89
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:18,151
PAIL OVER EVERYONE FOR HOW THEY

90
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:21,121
PARTICIPATED IN THIS AND IF YOU

91
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:22,322
WOULDN'T HAUL OUT AND MAKE

92
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,190
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SOMEONE THE

93
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,890
DAY BEFORE THEY WERE GOING IN

94
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,425
FRONT OF THE HEARING, YOU JUST

95
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:27,494
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

96
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,930
NORMAL PEOPLE -- EVEN WHEN THERE

97
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,764
ARE OPPOSED TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH,

98
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:32,533
WHICH THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO

99
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:33,701
BE, WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

100
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:36,036
IT JUST MAKES EVERYBODY LOOK

101
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,705
LIKE THEY ARE POLITICIZING THE

102
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:40,040
SUPREME COURT AND THE APPROVAL

103
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,407
PROCESS.

104
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:41,309
>> Bret: I TALKED TO A LOT OF

105
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:42,643
PEOPLE AND THEY SAY IT JUST

106
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:43,344
FEELS BAD NO MATTER WHAT SIDE

107
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,713
YOU'RE ON.

108
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:46,481
LISTENING TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND

109
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,215
HIS WIFE ON THE INTERVIEW WITH

110
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:49,417
MARTHA THE OTHER NIGHT, IS HE

111
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,953
MORE INDIGNANT, ANGRY?

112
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,154
>> I KNOW HE'S VERY UPSET ABOUT

113
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:54,155
IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE DIDN'T DO

114
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,357
IT, BUT HE'S A JUDGE.

115
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:57,725
HE'S NOT A TELEVISION PERSON,

116
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,093
HE'S NOT A TRIAL LAWYER LIKE I

117
00:02:59,093 --> 00:02:59,927
AM SO HE'S NOT USED TO TALKING

118
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,464
ABOUT THESE THINGS AND BEING ON

119
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:04,665
TELEVISION AND IT'S I THINK

120
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:05,600
EMBARRASSING IN FRONT OF HIS

121
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,569
FAMILY AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS TO

122
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,338
TALK ABOUT THAT HE DRANK AT

123
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,106
TIMES IN EXCESS WHEN HE WAS IN

124
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:13,741
COLLEGE, DATING GIRLS AND WHAT

125
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:14,208
HAPPENED.

126
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,643
IT'S NOT A COMFORTABLE POSITION.

127
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,945
IF THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T

128
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,313
HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.

129
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:20,047
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT COMES WITH

130
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:21,849
THE JOB INTERVIEW AND HE'S NOT

131
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,319
SAYING FEEL SORRY FOR HIM, BUT

132
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,987
HE'S OUTRAGED BY THIS MOST

133
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:28,957
RECENT ALLEGATION BECAUSE IT

134
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,925
SUGGESTS THAT FOR YEARS, YEARS,

135
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:31,760
THERE WAS GANG RAPE GOING ON AND

136
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,896
NO ONE SAID ANYTHING, A

137
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,131
MULTITUDE OF WOMEN AND A LARGE

138
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:37,932
NUMBER OF MEN WERE INVOLVED.

139
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,367
IT DOESN'T SAY HE WAS INVOLVED,

140
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,869
IT SAYS HE WAS PRESENT, WHICH HE

141
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:41,236
WAS NOT.

142
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:43,938
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THIS WOMAN,

143
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:45,774
BUT THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT

144
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:46,708
LEVEL OF ALLEGATION.

145
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,109
>> Bret: WE'RE IN THIS

146
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:49,344
ENVIRONMENT, OBVIOUSLY, PEOPLE

147
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,046
ARE BEING TOLD THAT THEY NEED TO

148
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,748
COME FORWARD.

149
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:54,516
2 OUT OF 3 DON'T REALLY TALK

150
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,484
ABOUT IT, BUT HERE YOU HAVE THE

151
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:59,254
END OF THE LINE AND THERE ARE A

152
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:02,924
NUMBER OF WOMEN COMING FORWARD.

153
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:03,658
>> I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN

154
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:05,760
DIDN'T WANT TO COME FORWARD.

155
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,762
AS I UNDERSTAND FOR DR. BLASEY

156
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:09,431
FORWARD, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME

157
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:09,764
FORWARD.

158
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:11,566
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

159
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:12,767
I FEEL SORRY FOR ANYONE WHO IS

160
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,937
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROCESS,

161
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:16,971
MARC SHORT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS

162
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:19,173
FRIENDS WITH, SOME OF THE OTHER

163
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,408
PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSEDLY AT

164
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,108
THIS PARTY THAT EVERYONE SAYS

165
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,445
DID NOT HAPPEN AND THEY DON'T

166
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:26,114
RECALL IT AND IT'S OF COURSE NOT

167
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:26,848
CONSISTENT WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH

168
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:31,920
OR WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT HIM, BUT

169
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,856
EVERYBODY IS DEMEANED BY THIS

170
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,458
PROCESS AND SOMEBODY LEAKED THAT

171
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,192
INFORMATION, I DON'T UNDERSTAND

172
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:41,663
WHY THIS INFORMATION BROUGHT

173
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:42,397
FORWARD BY MICHAEL AVENATTI WAS

174
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,432
HELD BACK UNTIL TODAY.

175
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:46,668
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY IT MAKES

176
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,802
EVERYONE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE,

177
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:49,337
BECAUSE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS A VERY

178
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:50,105
SERIOUS CLAIM AND IT'S DIFFICULT

179
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:53,174
FOR WOMEN TO TALK ABOUT IT.

180
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:53,942
AND IT SHOULDN'T BE POLITICIZED

181
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:55,910
ON EITHER SIDE.

182
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,911
IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE WOMEN AND

183
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:59,714
IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE MEN WHO

184
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,316
CAN BE ACCUSED OR WRONGLY

185
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:01,649
ACCUSED.

186
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,317
>> Bret: SO WHEN THEY KEEP

187
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:02,884
SAYING IT NEEDS TO BE

188
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:07,122
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI, WHAT IS

189
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:07,422
THIS?

190
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:08,857
>> WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL THE

191
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:09,924
POLICE?

192
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:10,925
THE DAY MR. MENOTTI STARTED

193
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:11,693
REPRESENTING HER, NO ONE STOPPED

194
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:15,363
HIM FROM GOING TO THE POLICE OR

195
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:15,830
THE FBI.

196
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,531
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

197
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:17,265
JUST IN TIME THE PHONE NUMBERS

198
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:19,167
OF THE FBI.

199
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,335
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

200
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:22,370
>> Bret: ALSO TODAY, THE

201
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,671
LAWYER FOR DR. BLASEY FORD AHEAD

202
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:24,973
OF THIS TESTIMONY PUT OUT --

203
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:26,941
SHE'S NOT GOING TO PUT UP THE

204
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:27,675
MEDICAL RECORDS ON THE NOTES BUT

205
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:30,178
SHE DID PUT OUT THE POLYGRAPH

206
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,313
THAT SHE APPARENTLY TOOK ON

207
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:34,649
AUGUST 7TH THE COMES TO THE

208
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:35,316
CONCLUSION ACCORDING TO THIS

209
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:36,918
PAPERWORK THAT IT'S NOT

210
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:39,154
INDICATIVE OF DECEPTION, HER

211
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:40,155
ANSWERS TO THIS POLYGRAPH, DOES

212
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:43,124
THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

213
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:44,759
>> THAT WAS UP TO DR. BLASEY.

214
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,760
SHE HAS HER REASONS FOR NOT

215
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,928
WANTING TO COME FORWARD BEFORE

216
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:49,130
AND THAT'S UP TO HER.

217
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,168
BUT THE NOTES THAT I READ ABOUT

218
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:53,868
IN "THE WASHINGTON POST" WHERE

219
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:56,504
THAT THERE WERE NOTES THAT HER

220
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:57,338
THERAPIST MADE IN COUPLES

221
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:58,473
THERAPY AND THAT THEY DON'T SEEM

222
00:05:58,473 --> 00:05:59,974
TO MATCH UP WITH WHAT PEOPLE ARE

223
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:02,310
SAYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED NOW.

224
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,078
THOSE WOULD BE RELEVANT BECAUSE

225
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:04,646
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE

226
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,314
SUPPOSEDLY EVER TALKED ABOUT

227
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:07,715
THIS AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY

228
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:08,917
WOULD TURN OVER THE NOTES BUT OF

229
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,018
COURSE THEY ARE SAYING THEIR

230
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,252
MEDICAL RECORDS, THEY DON'T WANT

231
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:11,653
TO DO THAT.

232
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,955
THAT'S UP TO THEM.

233
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:14,622
>> Bret: SHE OBVIOUSLY SAID

234
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:16,958
SHE WANTED TO BE ANONYMOUS BUT

235
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,926
IN AUGUST, TAKES THE POLYGRAPH,

236
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:19,928
HIRES AN ATTORNEY, WHAT IS THE

237
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:22,630
THINKING ABOUT THE REASONING?

238
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,965
>> I THINK WHAT'S OUT HERE IS

239
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:24,733
JUDGE KAVANAUGH KNOWS HE DIDN'T

240
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:25,400
DO THIS AND WHEN THESE

241
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,534
ALLEGATIONS COME OUT OF THE LAST

242
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:30,138
MINUTE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO

243
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:30,872
DISPROVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THAT

244
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:32,374
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

245
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:33,675
>> Bret: IS HE WORRIED THAT

246
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:34,376
SHE'S GOING TO COME OFF AS

247
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:37,412
CREDIBLE IN HIS HEARING AND THAT

248
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:39,581
THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE ONE OR TWO

249
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:40,148
VOTES?

250
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:40,849
>> HONESTLY HE'S NOT THINKING

251
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,118
ABOUT HER OTHER THAN I THINK HE

252
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:43,919
UNDERSTANDS THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT

253
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,354
TO BE PUBLIC ABOUT THIS EITHER.

254
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:47,489
HE WANTS TO COME FORWARD IN

255
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,725
FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND

256
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:52,094
EXPLAIN THAT HE DIDN'T DO THIS

257
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:52,861
UNTIL ANSWERS ANY QUESTIONS THAT

258
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,963
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

259
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:55,964
HAS UNTIL TELL THE TRUTH AND

260
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,300
THAT'S THE BEST HE CAN DO.

261
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,035
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE PROCESS, HOW

262
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,104
IT'S TURNED OUT, BUT HE

263
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:02,771
UNDERSTANDS THAT THAT'S HIS

264
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:04,439
OBLIGATION AND HE'S GOING TO DO

265
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,942
IT AND HE'S ANSWERED THOSE

266
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:07,743
QUESTIONS BEFORE AND HE'LL

267
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:08,410
ANSWER THEM AGAIN.

268
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,345
>> Bret: AND DOES HE WORRY AT

269
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:11,012
ALL ABOUT GETTING ON THE

270
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:11,747
SUPREME COURT AND THEN SOMEHOW

271
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:15,417
THIS DOESN'T STOP AND THAT THEY

272
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,152
GO AFTER HIM CONTINUALLY FOR

273
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:18,019
IMPEACHMENT OR SOMETHING ELSE?

274
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:20,922
>> I THINK WE ALL WORRY THAT IF

275
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:21,923
WE LOSE THE DIGNITY OF THE

276
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:25,327
PROCESS IT CAN AFFECT THE

277
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,895
SUPREME COURT AND EVERYBODY

278
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:30,432
INVOLVED, BUT I THINK AT THIS

279
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,199
POINT HE HAS HAD INVESTIGATION

280
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,868
AFTER INVESTIGATION.

281
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,269
HE'S HAD A LONG PERIOD MARK WITH

282
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,305
THE PUBLIC WAS ALLOWED TO LOOK

283
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,707
AT HIM, ASK QUESTIONS TO THE

284
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:39,541
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

285
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,143
IF SENATORS HAVE ASKED HIM

286
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:41,910
QUESTIONS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.

287
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,912
ALL THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND ALL

288
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:46,748
THAT WAS THERE FOR A REASON.

289
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:48,417
PEOPLE ARE THERE TO DECIDE WHAT

290
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:49,217
THEY THINK AND WHETHER THE

291
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:51,720
SENATORS WILL VOTE FOR HIM OR

292
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,421
NOT AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO

293
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:52,754
THAT.

294
00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:54,623
BUT IT CAN'T BE THAT WHEN PEOPLE

295
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,758
MAKE LAST-MINUTE ALLEGATIONS AND

296
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:59,194
THROW CHARACTER ASSASSINATION AT

297
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:01,497
HIM THAT THERE FOR THE ANSWER TO

298
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:05,534
STEP BACK AND DO NOT GO FORWARD.

299
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:06,201
THESE PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE

300
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:06,902
THEIR HEARING IN THE SENATORS

301
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:09,171
DESERVE TO VOTE AS THEY THINK

302
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:09,671
THEY SHOULD.

303
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,206
>> Bret: AND HE'S IN IT FOR

304
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:12,374
THE LONG HAUL.

305
00:08:12,374 --> 00:00:00,000
>> YES.
