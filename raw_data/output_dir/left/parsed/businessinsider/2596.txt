Unification is way down the road,
so that's the ultimate goal
that everyone says they want,
but no one thinks they're
very close to that.
(delicate music)
South Korea is so much
wealthier, more powerful,
it's just a totally
different type of country
than North Korea now that
it's hard to imagine them
unifying in any sort of easy way.
Society's have grown so far
apart, so I think that the
South Koreans would see
North Korea as a burden,
they'd have to invest an
enormous amount of money
to rebuild North Korea, reeducate,
or at least deal with
the costs of unification.
We have a country essentially
living in a dark period
where they have very
little internet access.
It's not like any other
country in the world;
North Korea is one of the
most isolated, closed off,
totalitarian societies in the world.
South Korea, on the flip
side, is one of the most open,
free, technologically savvy
societies in the world.
So, to combine those
seems almost unbelievable,
especially the younger generations
in both countries have really no memory
of any connection between the two sides.
There's not a huge
amount of popular support
in South Korea for unification.
People talk about it as
it's something that's great,
but they I think recognize how
different the countries are
and how unbelievably costly and difficult
an actual unification would be.
The main obstacles, I think,
are North Korea's difficult
relations with all the other
countries besides South Korea,
and that includes the
United States and China.
The real sticking point
is that technically
the United States and
North Korea are still
in an armed conflict, meaning
that the end of the Korean War
it was just a ceasefire, they never really
formally resolved all
the issues from that war.
And so that's why US troops
are still in South Korea,
and that's why they're all pretty much
on armed alert, they
could fight at any time.
Resolving those sort of
international complications
is really the bigger
obstacle, much less getting
to the question of what the
Koreas want from each other.
Unification is way down the road,
so that's the ultimate goal
that everyone says they want,
but no one thinks they're
very close to that.
I think what they would
want is de-escalation.
Maybe everyone agrees to
take down their nukes.
The US is ready- removed
all nuclear weapons
from South Korea and
the idea North Koreans
would shut down their nuclear program.
And then, some sort of
peace agreement with the
United States, and then
everyone starts pulling back
their troops from the demilitarized zone,
so that not everyone's ready
to shoot at a moment's notice.
Only at that point can they really talk
about some sort of unification.
I think regular exchanges where they start
opening up travel between
North Korea and South Korea.
They've done some cooperative projects
where they have these sort of peace zones
where they- South Koreans build stuff
and North Koreans and South Koreans can
sort of work together in some small zones.
I think that's what we
can imagine happening
after the nuclear crisis is solved.
Unification is just something-
it seems unlikely that could
happen anytime in the near
future unless North Korea just
collapses for some reason.
We don't have a lot of
precedence for this,
the best example for us in recent history
is the unification of West Germany
and East Germany in the early 90's.
In that situation
essentially East Germany was,
basically, swallowed up by West Germany
and I think that would be pretty simple.
Reason why that doesn't
seem likely to happen though
is because China has a strong
interest in maintaining
a separate country in North Korea
that's not just swallowed
up by South Korea.
And that's one of the biggest differences
between East Germany and West Germany
and North Korea and South Korea.
The Russians, or the Soviet
Union, no longer cared
whether East Germany became
part of West Germany,
but the Chinese still care
and they can make a big
difference in preserving North
Korea as a separate country.
