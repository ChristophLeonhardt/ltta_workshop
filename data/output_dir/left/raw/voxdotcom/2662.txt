1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Hey!

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,960
We have something special for you today.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,100
We've been hard at work on a new series with Netflix called "Explained."

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,100
If you like our YouTube, you're gonna love this.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,360
The reason we're making this show is because of you.

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,600
You, our subscribers.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,380
So they let us share the entire first episode right here.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,420
There's two more episodes on Netflix at netflix.com/explained.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,180
You can go right now, they are there for you to watch.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,960
Every Wednesday there is going to be a new story.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,940
Add it to your list and enjoy.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,100
[SINGING] 'Cause I'm in love...

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,610
From virtually the moment we’re born, there’s
a story that’s preached across cultures

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,960
and continents.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,340
It’s a familiar fairy tale...

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,240
She was even more beautiful than he had thought.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,860
That finding one, true, love is the key to
a fulfilled and happy life.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,040
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,480
And the thing is, I love you.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,240
I love you.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,500
I love you.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,920
Ditto.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,099
As an adult, we’re forced to reconcile
the messaging on monogamy with one simple

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,760
fact...

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,500
Humans are terrible at it.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,160
It’s kept Jerry Springer on the air for
25 years.

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,820
Ohhhhh!

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
I've been...
...sleeping with Eddie.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,380
He cheated on me with her?

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,580
I have your name tattoed on me!

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,820
How many girls you take from me, Aaron?

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,300
In 2016, 2.2 million U.S. couples got married.

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,200
But over 800,000 called it quits.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,580
Our quest for – and failure at – monogamy
has caused so much pain and heartbreak.

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,500
If it’s so hard for humans to be monogamous,
why do most of us, all around the world, make

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,240
it one of the most central goals of our lives?

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,860
I start asking myself, "Is he right for me?"

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,710
If you ask couples why they chose monogamy,
you’ll hear one answer again and again.

39
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,380
They fell in love.

40
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,880
We met in a candy store.

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,400
1946.

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,740
We went to college together.

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,340
We were both in a relationship then...

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,459
We didn't cheat.

45
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,210
You look so guilty every time we talk about
this.

46
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm bad at talking about this.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,160
It's arranged marriage,
whatever they selected for me, it was good.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,780
And I am very happy with that.

49
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,610
We had a study date one night, and that study
break turned into anatomy, I guess.

50
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,840
I've never felt this way about anybody before.

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,540
I feel God has blessed us.

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,310
We found true love.

53
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,310
Of course we did.

54
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,040
We're still here, 70 years, what do you expect.

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,840
25 years I would've gotten out on good behavior.

56
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,520
I would like to think that soul mates are

57
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,530
real, but...

58
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,700
She's my soul mate.

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,060
Well, you're mine too.

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,020
But monogamy and love aren’t the same thing.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,440
We are so psychotically welded to this idea

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,340
that monogamy means love, and love means monogamy,

63
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,500
and in the absence of monogamy, there is not
love.

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,960
Love is a feeling.

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
Monogamy is a rule.

66
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,400
You’ll only have sex with this one person,
and most people live in a culture where they’re

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,440
expected – at some point – to make that
rule a legal contract called marriage.

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,710
In many countries, breaking that rule is a
crime.

69
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:50,000
In the U.S., adultery is illegal in at least
20 states, and although they’re rarely enforced,

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,190
punishments can range from a $10 fine to three
years in prison.

71
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,209
If you are in a monogamous relationship for
50 years and you fell down once, you cheated

72
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,430
once – the whole relationship was a lie
and a failure.

73
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,890
Most human beings have ambivalent impulses
that it's nice to have someone you can rely

74
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,080
on, but there's also the temptation of novelty.

75
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,380
Why would humans all around the world invent
a rule that’s so difficult to follow, and

76
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,100
treat breaking it as such an enormous betrayal?

77
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,999
Should a male have on his clothing so much
as a strand of hair from a female not his

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,420
wife, a serious crisis may result.

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,640
For more than a century, there’s been a
culturally accepted explanation.

80
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,920
Sound check.

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,500
One, one, one, one, one, one, one.

82
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:43,259
The standard narrative is the story that everybody
knows: that men want to be free sexually and

83
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,509
spread their seed around the world, and women
want to be very exclusive and particular and

84
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:54,289
choose a provider, because they're vulnerable
and the children need someone to take care

85
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,430
of them, and all that.

86
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,480
Women trade sexual fidelity to men in exchange
for goods and services essentially.

87
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,879
In this narrative, there’s another reason
why men wouldn’t want women to sleep around.

88
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,400
If a baby comes out of a woman's body, there
is no question but that she is genetically

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,160
related to that baby.

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,040
The male has to take the woman's word for
it.

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,960
Biologists have known for a very long time
that men are far more inclined to seek multiple

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,229
sexual partners.

93
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,680
And the reason for that is is really quite
clear.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,500
Now in the first place, remember that the
male sperm cells are being produced all the

95
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,180
time.

96
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,820
While only one egg cell is produced each month.

97
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,180
There's a very good – and I don't mean ethically
good – but very understandable evolutionary

98
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,180
payoff for males as being randy bastards.

99
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,280
But there’s one big issue with that explanation
– of promiscuous, possessive men and demure

100
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
women.

101
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,920
At lots of points in time, and places in the
world, people didn’t follow it.

102
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,839
Anatomically modern human beings have existed
for at least 300,000 years.

103
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,340
And for more than 90% of that time, we lived
as hunter-gatherers.

104
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,780
Anthropologists refer to them as fiercely
egalitarian.

105
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,729
There's no reason to think that our ancestors
shared everything except sexual partners.

106
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,969
Of course we can't go back and interview our
foraging ancestors, but we have the accounts

107
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:33,710
of explorers and Europeans who first developed
and saw these societies before they'd been

108
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,569
much touched by outsiders, and their surprise
and shock at the difference in sexual mores.

109
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,520
There's a wonderful story that a Jesuit who
lived with the Naskapi Indians for some time

110
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,789
and he would ask, "If you let your wives have
this much freedom, how do you know that the

111
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,009
child she bears will belong to you?"

112
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,580
And he recorded the answer of the Indian:

113
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,189
"Thou has no sense."

114
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:00,259
The guy said, "You Frenchmen love only the
children of your body, but we love all the

115
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,560
children of the tribe."

116
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,820
If a child is crying, the adult nearest to
that child picks it up.

117
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,280
Nobody says, "Hey, hey your kid's crying."

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,580
No, it's – there's a commonality to parenthood
among hunter-gatherers.

119
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,379
One of those groups are the Bari of Venezuela,
where every man who sleeps with a woman while

120
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:24,539
she’s pregnant is considered a father of
the child, and helps provide for it.

121
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:30,039
Now in our society, that would probably not
work very well, I'm not recommending it.

122
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,469
But in that society, a child who had several
fathers named, because she'd slept with several

123
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:41,800
fathers, actually had a much better chance
of surviving to adulthood because those men

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
contributed.

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,929
Did you ever think of going with somebody
else after you married me?

126
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,159
What are you, crazy?

127
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,360
We don't like to say that we're open, we like
to say we're slightly ajar.

128
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Exactly.

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,229
That's not good, in my way.

130
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,980
In our language also they say
Pati parmeshwar.

131
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,899
That means husband is like God.

132
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,119
This is our culture.

133
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,620
We actually kind of met through the non-monogamy
community.

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,959
I define this relationship as, this is my
cohabitating partner and we call each other

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
otters.

136
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,979
We are our primary partners and our other
partners are secondary partners.

137
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:20,289
I find it really fascinating.

138
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,490
I think about a lot like if I could ever do
that, and I don't know if I could.

139
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,770
I had a threesome with, like, two friends
of mine that I initiated.

140
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,020
I decided that it would be cool to experiment
with multiple people with, like, somebody

141
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,360
that I really loved and cared about.

142
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,100
The queer community has been berated with
the idea that our relationships are lesser,

143
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,929
and that they're not actually up to par and
that standard of – you know, the heteronormative

144
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,759
standard, and all that's bull.

145
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,400
"We shouldn’t be surprised that some cultures
practice non-monogamy.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,960
Because in the animal world, true sexual monogamy
is virtually unheard of."

147
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,520
The most romantic creature might be the diplozoon
paradoxum.

148
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,440
A parasitic tapeworm that literally fuses
together with its partner for life.

149
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,460
But humans aren’t tapeworms.

150
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,800
We’re apes.

151
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,540
And our closest relatives in the animal world
are chimps and bonobos.

152
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,300
We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos
than the Indian elephant is to the African

153
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,800
elephant.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,140
The close comparison exists in bone and muscle
structure, and in the capability of responding

155
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,720
to stimuli and solving problems.

156
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,060
Clearly chimps and bonobos are anything but
monogamous.

157
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,800
Bonobos have sex at the drop of a hat.

158
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,700
[SINGING] I know – I know – that I just
met you...

159
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,590
They have sex to say hello, they have sex
to say goodbye, they have sex when they're

160
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,150
stressed out.

161
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,740
For both the male and female bonobos, that
free love philosophy makes evolutionary sense.

162
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,240
The males get to spread their seed, and the
females get to take in the seed of multiple

163
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,440
males – which then compete against each
other to fertilize her egg.

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,880
It’s survival of the fittest – for sperm.

165
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,630
There are aspects of bonobo anatomy that seem
adapted to promiscuity.

166
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,630
And intriguingly, you can also find a lot
of them in humans.

167
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,080
Suggesting we may have evolved to be non-monogamous, too.

168
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,940
There’s body dimorphism...

169
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,170
In species that are more promiscuous, the
males tend to be 15 to 25 percent larger than

170
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,080
the females.

171
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,660
And in theory, if there are males battling
to impregnate women, testicles would be bigger

172
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,860
and stronger.

173
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,900
You'll see that human testicles are intermediate
between very large testicles in bonobos and

174
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,110
chimpanzees, and very small testicles in gorillas
for example.

175
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,340
There’s the human penis – tied for the
biggest among all primates – which has a

176
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
unique shape.

177
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,010
We have this much thicker penis with the flared
head.

178
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:55,940
This shape creates a vacuum in the female's
reproductive tract that tends to pull any

179
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,160
sperm that's already there, it pulls it down
away from the ovum.

180
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,060
Thereby giving an advantage to the sperm of
the man who's having sex at the moment.

181
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,200
There’s also female copulatory vocalization
– a phenomenon so well- known and accepted,

182
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,430
it’s a standard feature of movie sex scenes.

183
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,430
Oh!

184
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,430
Oh!

185
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,380
Ahh!

186
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Oh.

187
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,920
What we see is that female copulatory vocalization
is common among primates that engage in sperm

188
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,930
competition.

189
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,529
Then there’s the fact that humans and bonobos
have sex to bond, and not just to have children

190
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:35,120
– which might explain the way we face each
other during intercourse.

191
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,110
You see humans and bonobos are the only two
that face each other while they're having

192
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,110
sex.

193
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,160
And why we have a lot more of it than most
mammals.

194
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,300
So clearly when people say so-and-so had sex
like an animal, they're getting it backwards.

195
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,740
And there’s now a lot of evidence that monogamy
is a more recent invention than most of us

196
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,800
would expect.

197
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
Around 12,000 years ago – when most humans
stopped being hunter- gatherers, and figured

198
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,360
out how to farm.

199
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,100
You get a very overpowering concern with property
rights.

200
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,450
As the Greeks put it, you don't want a foreign
seed introduced into your soil.

201
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:22,270
For thousands of years, marriage was the main
way that you increased your family labor force,

202
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,210
you made peace treaties, business alliances.

203
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:31,480
The more I've studied the more I became convinced
that marriage was invented not to do with

204
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,240
the individual relationship with the man and
the woman, but to get in-laws.

205
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,180
You know, and it's amusing because today we
see in-laws as a big threat to the solidarity

206
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,840
of the man and the woman.

207
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,540
But that's what marriage was about.

208
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,910
You look back at Anthony and Cleopatra, that
was not a love story at all.

209
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,840
That was two people from the most powerful
empires in the world trying to figure out

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,350
how they could get together and rule both
of those empires.

211
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,630
The idea of marrying someone for love?

212
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,000
Coontz says western societies only started
doing that a few hundred years ago.

213
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,900
As we made a transition to the idea that marriage
should be on the basis of love, it scared

214
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,880
people.

215
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,680
Defenders of traditional marriage said, "Oh
my gosh, how will we get a woman to marry

216
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,300
at all if she says, 'Ew I don't love him.'

217
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,110
How will we stop people from getting divorced?"

218
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,630
So a new idea took hold: men and women needed
to find love and marry, because they were

219
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,340
two parts of a whole.

220
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,140
Men were aggressive and protective.

221
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,220
Women were nurturing and demure.

222
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,900
They were opposites who completed each other.

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,060
The field of evolutionary biology also developed
around this time; pioneered by male scientists,

224
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,480
who used their theories on sexual selection
to explain Victorian gender roles.

225
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,520
As Charles Darwin wrote in “The Descent
of Man”:

226
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:02,120
“Woman seems to differ from man in mental
disposition, chiefly in her greater tenderness

227
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,040
and less selfishness...Man delights in competition,
and this leads to ambition..."

228
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,960
"Thus man has ultimately become superior to
woman.”

229
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,040
And it’s possible his ideas became so popular
and survived so long, because it made sense

230
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,500
to us in the societies we were living in.

231
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,910
But if monogamy is all a made-up construct,
a way to enforce gender roles and social order,

232
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,740
how do we explain that visceral, deep-rooted
feeling we get when our loved ones stray?

233
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,520
Tell me something: are you the jealous type?

234
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,160
I feel like we don't really deal too much
with jealousy.

235
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,630
I don't know why that is.

236
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,150
I think it's just 'cause we're sluts, to be
honest.

237
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,110
I don't get, like, jealous like that, you
know.

238
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,230
It's important I think to understand why you're
feeling jealous, because jealousy is not just

239
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,840
a – it's not a feeling, it's usually rooted
in some other sort of thing.

240
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,120
It's not a descending guillotine.

241
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,000
It's like, jealousy is an event.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,020
What's the best way to deal with that event?

243
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,460
Who were you really with?

244
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,560
That, that little blonde secretary from the
office?

245
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,720
I don't think you'll ever find any society
where there was no sexual jealousy.

246
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,970
But we also have these other kinds of impulses
of generosity and of a sense that maybe there

247
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,740
are other parts of the person that are more
important than the sexual person.

248
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,120
And these coexist and they battle, and I think
they will always battle.

249
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,520
I coined the term monogamish to describe my
own relationship with my husband.

250
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,089
We're together 24 years, not monogamous for
20 of those 24 years.

251
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,210
And I've had people look at me and say, "I
could never do what you guys do because I

252
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,340
value commitment too highly.

253
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,300
All three of my marriages were monogamous."

254
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,560
And what that says is this person was committed
to monogamy, not to any of the people that

255
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,360
they married, they were committed to monogamy.

256
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,160
Non-monogamy is getting more mainstream attention.

257
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,940
Define polyamorous.

258
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,060
Without monogamy.

259
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,880
Polyamory...

260
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,720
Polyamory...

261
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,420
Polyamorous...

262
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,140
It's called...

263
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,640
Poly–

264
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,860
–amory
Polyamorous people.

265
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,540
Throuple.

266
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Not monogamous, ok.

267
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
You couldn't be.

268
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,040
A 2016 study found one in five Americans had
been in a non- monogamous relationship at

269
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
some point.

270
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,460
And in another survey, a third of Americans
said their ideal relationship would be non-monogamous.

271
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,680
Monogamy as we know it has been through many
incarnations.

272
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:31,190
It’s been forced, it’s been useful, it’s
been beautiful, it’s been subverted.

273
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,029
As human society evolves, so will human sexuality.

274
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:40,580
As we enter what I think of as uncharted territory,
for the first time in human history we are

275
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:46,080
trying to develop relationships that are not
based on coercion: coercion of women by their

276
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,279
economic and legal dependence, coercion of
women by their bodies, coercion of men by

277
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,300
the social and economic structures.

278
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,960
We're trying I think to find maybe a new balance.

279
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,400
Monogamy isn't natural.

280
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,500
It means we have to recognize that because
it's not natural, it's something that we're

281
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,920
going to have to work for if we want it.

282
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,640
One of the things that I think makes human
beings particularly interesting and maybe

283
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,940
even unique in the animal world, is that we're
capable of doing things that are unnatural.

284
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,459
Monogamy is like vegetarianism.

285
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,398
You can choose to be a vegetarian.

286
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:26,868
And that can be healthy, it can be ethical,
it can be a wonderful decision, but because

287
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:32,159
you've chosen to be vegetarian, doesn't mean
that bacon stops smelling good.

288
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:37,270
If we’re lucky, it’s no longer about what
kinds of relationships we should have in the

289
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,300
modern world; it’s about designing the kinds
of relationships we want to have.

290
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,240
Humans may not have evolved to be sexually
monogamous – but we have evolved to be adaptable.
