um but really it's this they might come in six to seven minutes but a lot can happen in six to seven minutes and so why don't we I'm going to refrain from making any jokes about that because I think they'd be in poor taste but you make a very valid implied one that is true that is it's both a joke and a reality yeah you know everything that matters in that scenario is gonna happen before the cops get there nine times out of ten and you were there was a great New York Times piece and you wrote in it this is a personal thing for you you grew up in a single-mother household you you had been assaulted you this is this isn't just some political philosophy conversation this is something that you can really speak about as a as an individual absolutely and also the fact that at that point when I was making those decisions of man I do want to fight for this issue because you know it is not even a political issue because I dealt with it but I was coming from the left at that point I was brand new I I think I'm gonna think at that time I made a decision that I realized you know what I do have conservative values and that's why I realize I can strongly you know go to the point that it is not a political issue it really is me American I should it is a human rights issue it really is but particularly with women and the differences that science has proven over and over again but really when it's not even just about that I mean you're you I mean yeah or coming against someone who is a male or woman who has a firearm that person is gonna win you know regardless of how big you are you're male or not no I am very much so it is true physically intimidate a lot of attackers but now even despite all those great qualities you know it's it's still bad for you at that point to have something that's gonna be equalizer so I think that's important do you think there's a racial component of this too you know specifically toward arming young black women who are say disproportionately more likely to be assaulted or do you think there is a racial inequality on this issue I think I mean this that's I've been showing that black women and black women are the fastest-growing demographic who are becoming gun owners and so I think they are seeing that whether it's a political issue and that's a lot of people they they hate the fact that you know black women are now becoming gun owners and so they twist it into well it's because the less what happened to last year oh it's Trump you know racism and it's just spinning is this good you know just blown up and that's why our gun now yeah to protect against Trump Trump and the racism that's you know just prevalent now it doesn't kind of it no and I always said they talked to me about that they'll interview me about that and be like no it's been happening the last few years before we even knew about Trump so I'm not gonna do with that for me I think it's also has to do with the rise of women in general you know a lot more about you talk about governance and a lot more of us are you know will fire a buyer self at home a lot of us are still pursuing an education longer maybe you know that transition from leaving a household where your father figure is there and then having it where your spouse is there there's a bigger gap there so a lot more women feel that they have to take safety into their own hands and I actually was also think that's just an extension of you know if you want to bring with them in this aspect of it the feminist movement is an extension of that independence and so black women especially are in these areas that tend to be you know sisters statistically more dangerous and they're by themselves and so I hear all the time with other women with their daughters and they're like I want to buy his gun kind of went protect my daughter I want to know how to use it I want to protect myself so I think that's really what it's about that's the single woman
