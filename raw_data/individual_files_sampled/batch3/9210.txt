I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA, HE GIVES US TREMENDOUS CREDIT. I REMEMBER IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AGO. NOBEL THEY ARE SAYING AS PRESIDENT TRUMP TOUTED PROGRESS IN NORTH KOREA AT A RALLY IN MICHIGAN THIS WEEKEND. HIS SUPPORTERS STARTED CHANTING NOBEL IN THE PEACE PRIZE. NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GET THAT A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE FORMALLY NOMINATED HIM FOR THE 2019 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. INDIANA CONGRESSMAN LUKE MESSER IS LEADING THE EFFORT. HE CALLS FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN POLICY COMMITTEE. AND CANDIDATE FOR SENATE IN INDIANA HE JOINS US FROM INDIANAPOLIS. LUKE, GOOD MORNING TO YOU. HEY, STEVE, GREAT TO BE ON. STEVE: WHY DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD GET THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. YOU KNOW, EVENTS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA COMING TOGETHER WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIMAGINABLE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. FRANKLY THE RESPONSE FROM MANY IN THE MEDIA HAS BEEN MUTED AND I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SHOWING THAT PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH IS WORKING AND THE ONLY REASON THAT THE EVIL DICTATOR FROM NORTH KOREA IS COMING TO THE TABLE IS BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT HAS STARED HIM DOWN. AND AS PEACE COMES TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA, DO I BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP DESERVES THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. STEVE: CHAIRMAN, IT DOES LOOK AS IF THERE ARE TANGIBLE RULES THAT HE IS GETTING THINGS DONE, BECAUSE NOT ONLY WILL THE LOCATION OF THE SUMMIT AND THE TIME BE RELEASED SHORTLY BUT THE NEWS THIS MORNING, OUR LEAD STORY IS THE FACT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE NORTH KOREANS ARE ABOUT TO RELEASE THOSE THREE AMERICANS, JUST TO SHOW THAT THEY WANT TO WHEEL AND DEAL WITH THIS PRESIDENT. ABSOLUTELY. AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, LISTEN, WE ARE A LONG WAY AWAY. THIS NORTH KOREAN LEADER IS A RUTHLESS GUY WHO HAS LIED TO PEOPLE BEFORE THERE ARE TANGIBLE STEPS ALREADY HAPPENING. HAVE YOU BOTH LEADERS TALKING ABOUT A UNITED KOREA, TALKING ABOUT ENDING THOSE NUCLEAR PROGRAMS. THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER HAS ALREADY ENDED HIS TESTING PROGRAM. THERE ARE MAJOR STEPS HAPPENING AND, AGAIN, THE ONLY REASON IT'S HAPPENING IS BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT'S STRONG LEADERSHIP. FRANKLY, THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT HAS EVEN SAID AS MUCH. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T HELP AS YOU WATCH ALL THIS JUST WONDER HOW DO YOU THINK FOLKS ON THE LEFT WOULD BE RESPONDING RIGHT NOW IF THIS WAS HAPPENING UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP. I MEAN, THEY WOULD BE MELTING WITH JOY. STEVE: SURE. INSTEAD, THEY ARE, OF COURSE, KIND OF SAYING LET'S WAIT AND SEE. WE DO WANT TO WAIT AND SEE AND THERE IS A LOT MORE TO GET DONE BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ALREADY IS EXTRAORDINARY. STEVE: KEEP IN MIND, PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE BEFORE HE ACTUALLY DID ANYTHING. AT LEAST WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HE GETTING SOME NUMBERS UP ON THE BOARD. YEAH. PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE LITTLE MORE THAN RUNNING A GLAMOROUS CAMPAIGN. THE CRITICS ON THE LEFT FOR THIS PRESIDENT'S POLICIES ON NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN WIDTH THEY'RES. I'M RUNNING IN INDIANA AGAINST A GUY NAMED JOE DONNELLY WHO SPENT MUCH OF THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF CRITICIZING PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR HIS TWITTER DIPLOMACY AND STRONG POSTURE HE HAS TAKEN AGAINST NORTH KOREA. SEEING EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS. NOT JUST NORTH KOREA. ISIS ON THE RUN, THE ECONOMY IS GOING GREAT. LISTEN THRNKS IS A LOT GOING ON UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP. STEVE: RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE OUT OF INDIANA.
