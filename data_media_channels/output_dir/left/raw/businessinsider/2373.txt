00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,519
lots of questions from readers this

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,900
morning thank you for responding so

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,609
quickly we didn't get the notice up as

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,439
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we usually do first question</font>

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,350
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> overvalued at a hundred and</font>

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,060
forty dollars a share obviously this is

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,320
a stock that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been watching for a</font>

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,699
long time i should<font color="#E5E5E5"> say up front that i</font>

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,310
own it i bought it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1999 and have been</font>

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,040
carrying it around often<font color="#CCCCCC"> a painful</font>

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,230
carrying around but the answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,149
actually probably think it is at this

13
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,590
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that analysts are</font>

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,540
generally much too optimistic about the

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,790
kindle<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information we're getting is</font>

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,469
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that publishers are not</font>

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,570
willing to suddenly slash prices on

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,430
books newspapers are not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,870
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in building for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kindle</font>

20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,430
and so forth so it's off<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a great</font>

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,829
buzzy start but everyone is just

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,600
delirious about how much money

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,850
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon is going to make on</font>

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kindle we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very skeptical about</font>

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,649
that long term I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon's in a</font>

26
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,629
great position but<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the kindle</font>

27
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,069
and the fact that half<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business is</font>

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">still dependent on the physical sale of</font>

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,760
books and<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are rapidly</font>

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,950
getting digitized<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are many</font>

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,680
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> there what is the future of AOL</font>

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,720
or what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the future is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,070
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a chance at this point</font>

34
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually i think there is a good core</font>

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,030
idea in AOL i think tim armstrong is

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,040
doing a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> job of managing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,380
expectations around this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,689
unfortunately cutting a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

39
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,790
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right move here to get the cost</font>

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure in line i suspect that he will</font>

41
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,079
sell off a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of businesses like</font>

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,009
mapquest maybe icq maybe advertising.com

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,740
and ultimately narrow it down to this

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,520
really core engine of isp portal

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,130
spraying traffic at a content creation

46
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,810
engine<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think he'll probably by</font>

47
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,820
associated content or build that sort of

48
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,770
platform and that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really a</font>

49
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,820
business there and then ultimately

50
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,969
within a year or two AOL has to be

51
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,700
merged with either msn yahoo or possibly

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,930
even google which is very unlikely

53
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,689
because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't see room for four</font>

54
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,549
players so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think from this level</font>

55
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,140
they have they have chopped down the

56
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">expectations so much that i'm actually</font>

57
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:09,610
opt

58
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,070
mystic about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen there why</font>

59
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,600
are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> using live stream even though we</font>

60
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a ton of complaints about it lots of</font>

61
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,840
reasoning here first live stream has

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,370
been a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner they really helped</font>

63
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">us work through this the main reason</font>

64
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we started with live stream is that</font>

65
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,000
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do live to tape and right</font>

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,130
up on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet very very well that's</font>

67
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,390
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of other companies</font>

68
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet video solutions</font>

69
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,010
don't we are certainly looking at a lot

70
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,590
of others our main<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern that in that</font>

71
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you and we have obviously heard the</font>

72
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,160
complaints from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning about the</font>

73
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,560
consistency of live<font color="#CCCCCC"> streams so we will</font>

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ultimately</font>

75
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,220
will either fix it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have a</font>

76
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">different solution but they have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

77
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">great partner thus far lots of</font>
