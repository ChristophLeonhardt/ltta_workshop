>> Sandra: TODAY MARKS 74
YEARS SINCE ALLIED FORCES
STORMED THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY
IN A DARING MISSION THAT
ULTIMATELY LED TO THE TOTAL
DEFEAT OF NAZI GERMANY.
THE THINGS THEY WITNESSED WERE
UNSPEAKABLE.
TODAY, AND A MOVING CEREMONY IN
WASHINGTON, SOME OF THE MEN WHO
TOOK PART IN OPERATION OVERLORD
LAID A WREATH.
BUT AHEAD OF THAT EVENT, THE
GOOD FOLKS OF THE NATIONAL
WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL INTRODUCED
US TO TWO OF THOSE REMARKABLE
MEN.
MARTHA TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON
YESTERDAY TO HEAR THEIR STORIES.
>> MY FULL NAME IS HARLAN
LINCOLN HORNER.
I WAS 18 WHEN I WENT INTO
SERVICE IN APRIL OF 1943.
I WAS 19 WHEN I WENT OVERSEAS.
>> I WAS 18.
MY FULL NAME IS McDONALD H
BEACH.
>> YOU WERE SENT OVER ON A SHIP
FOR A LONG TIME?
>> NINE DAYS ON THE OLD FRANCE.
I WAS SEASICK FOR NINE STRAIGHT
DAYS, NEVER THOUGHT I'D REACH
THE WAR.
BUT IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OFF
THE SHIP.
>> WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR
COMMANDERS TELLING YOU ABOUT THE
MISSION?
ABOUT THE INVASION, ABOUT D-DAY?
>> ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL,
THE GREATEST FORCE EVER HURLED
AGAINST A HOSTILE SHORE.
>> I DON'T THINK THEY KNEW TOO
MUCH WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE
BETWEEN 10:00 A.M. AND NOON, AND
WE DIDN'T GET THERE UNTIL 7:00
IN THE EVENING AND BECAUSE OF
THE
THE HEAVY SEAS.
SO WE STAYED ON THE BEACH ALL
NIGHT AND WATCH THE FIRING OF
THE BRITISH BATTLESHIPS AND ALL
THE OTHER SHIPS FIRING ONTO THE
GERMAN FORTIFICATIONS ON SHORE.
>> Martha: WHAT STANDS OUT TO
YOU WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO BEING
THERE?
>> SEEING THE WOUNDED AND SOME
OF THE DEBT ON THE BEACH AS WELL
AS A TOUGH SITUATION.
>> Martha: TELL ME ABOUT YOUR
ARRIVAL IN FRANCE AFTER D-DAY.
>> WE HAD TO WALK.
I KEPT THINKING THAT DUFFEL BAG
WAS SO HEAVY.
I KEPT THINKING, I CAN'T DO
THIS.
BUT I THOUGHT, IF ALL THESE
OTHER GUYS CAN DO IT, I CAN DO
IT.
I STOPPED AND A PIECE OF
SHRAPNEL WENT ACROSS.
IT WAS NOTHING BUT A FLESH
WOUND, BUT I WAS LEFT IN THE
FIELDS OVERNIGHT AND I GOT
PNEUMONIA.
>> Martha: YOU ARE LEFT IN THE
FIELD OVERNIGHT?
>> A WHOLE BUNCH OF US WERE.
>> THERE WERE INTERESTING AND
FUNNY TIMES AND REALLY
HORRENDOUS TIMES.
WE WERE A CHILD, THAT WAS THE
SCARIEST PART.
>> ONE OF THE MOST POIGNANT
THINGS TO ME WAS, IN LONDON,
BEFORE WE WENT ACROSS TO
NORMANDY.
SUCH A NICE GIRL THAT I DANCE
WITH.
AND SHE SAID, MY NAME IS
DOROTHY.
COME ANY TIME, I'M MOST NIGHTS.
AND ONE OF THE STRIKES COME UP
THAT LITTLE DANCE BAR WAS
COMPLETELY WIPED OUT.
>> Martha: DID YOU LOSE
FRIENDS IN THE WAR?
>> WE LOST OUR BATTERY
COMMANDER, AND WE LOST A GUNNERY
SERGEANT, AND OUR FIRST
SERGEANT.
AND MY VERY CLOSE FRIEND, WHO
WAS A RADIO OPERATOR WITH ME.
BOB BOWDEN FROM NEW MEXICO WAS
CAPTURED, AND HE WAS INJURED AND
IN A GERMAN HOSPITAL FOR A
WHILE.
AND THEN WHEN THEY LEFT THE
TOWN, THEY RELEASED HIM AND LET
HIM GO.
HE CAME BACK WITHOUT HIS HELMET,
I WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM.
>> Martha: DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT MOMENT WHEN HE SHOWED UP?
>> YES I DO.
WHEN HE WALKED INTO THE BATTERY
AREA, I RAN OVER TO GREET HIM,
IT WAS GREAT.
>> Martha: AND YOU WERE IN
PRETTY MUCH EVERY MAJOR
OPERATION ALL THE WAY FROM
NORMANDY TO V-E DAY.
>> ALL FIVE CAMPAIGNS.
NORMANDY, FRANCE, BATTLE OF THE
BULGE, RHINELAND AND IN CENTRAL
EUROPE.
>> Martha: TELL ME ABOUT WHEN
YOU GOT WORD THE WAR WAS OVER.
>> THIS IS A SOLEMN BUT GLORIOUS
HOUR.
I WISH THAT
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT HAD LIVED
TO SEE THIS DAY.
>> WE HEARD IT ON THE TINKERS
RADIO, AND IT WAS A WILD
CELEBRATION.
WE COULDN'T FIND ANY PILLS OR
BEER.
WHEAT SAID IT, WHERE'S THE BEER?
WELL SOMEONE HAD FOUND A
WAREHOUSE OF WONDERFUL GERMAN
BRANDY.
THEY FELT OF A TWO AND A HALF
TON TRUCK WITH IT AND OUR
BATTERY COMMANDER SAID, THAT'S
FINE, BUT YOU HAVE TO SHARE WITH
THE REST OF THE BATTALION.
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT YOU,
DON, WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES OF
THAT?
>> I REMEMBER THAT DAY.
THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS
ALWAYS UNDER FOOT, RUNNING HERE
AND IF THEY THERE.
HE CAME RACING IN AND SPOKE IN
GERMAN.
AND MY LIEUTENANT SAID IT, DON'T
TELL ANYBODY, BUT I'VE GOT
SOMETHING UP AND SAVING.
AND HE GOT OUT A BOTTLE OF
CHAMPAGNE THAT WAS ROOM
TEMPERATURE.
AND WE ALL DRINK IT.
>> Martha: THERE IS A PRAYER,
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR
WITH IT.
BUT FDR READ UP ON THE RADIO.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT?
>> NO.
>> Martha: IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
PRAYER, A RADIO ADDRESS TO ALL
1944.
AND IT PART OF IT HE SAYS, THEY
WILL NEED THEIR BLESSINGS.
THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND HARD.
FOR THE ENEMY IS STRONG.
THEY WILL BE SORE TRYING COME BY
NIGHT AND BY DAY, WITHOUT REST,
UNTIL THE VICTORY IS WON.
THE DARKNESS WILL BE RENT BY
NOISE AND FLAME.
MEN'S SOULS WILL BE SHAKEN WITH
THE VIOLENCES OF WAR.
>> YOU KNOW, ALL OF US THAT WERE
GOING TO BE IN ON D-DAY,
EISENHOWER WROTE A LETTER.
AND PART OF IT IS INSCRIBED
RIGHT HERE ON THE WALL.
>> Martha: DE REMEMBER WHAT IT
SAYS?
>> WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A
GREATS CRUSADE AND, LORD
HELPING, WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL
AND WE SHALL NOT SURRENDER.
