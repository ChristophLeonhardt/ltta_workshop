back during the 2016 election Bernie Sanders and his philosophy and his plans were described depending on who you talk to as crazy or extreme or pie-in-the-sky or too expensive to to actually have happen and we now find out despite that there embraced by the vast majority of pretty much every group in America and the reason that I think that this is significant is already and we're still years out from the next presidential election more and more politicians appear to be templating at least some of their platform all in the ideas that were given a test run during Bernie Sanders candidacy let alone the fact that it's entirely possible that he himself will run again and so this is significant for the Democratic Party in general and potentially for the fate of the white house as well and so let's take a look at what people think about some of his plans including the core philosophy and that is that we need a political revolution to redistribute the wealth that has been taken from working Americans and take it back from the wealthy that have been doing the stealing for a number of decades if we could bring up this chart you're gonna see broken down by groups the darker bar is the people who agree that we need that overall it poles 54% approved to 30% disagree that's fairly overwhelming consensus but you'll see that in certain groups the support is even stronger independence very much support that concept those who didn't vote in 2012 overwhelmingly think that we need that sort of political revolution so imagine the power of having a person giving across that message bringing those people back into voting even Tea Party supporters overwhelmingly agree with Bernie Sanders on that all those seniors not necessarily what to check with Dianne Feinstein I'm not sure but anyway overwhelming support there it's you know independence it's evangelicals whites overall agree with it so very very positive when it comes to that political revolution concept what you guys think about that well I'm gonna I'm gonna actually take a position that won't be popular on this I don't buy this okay I think people say this but when they step into the voting booth it was like when Donald Trump was running there were pio I would never vote for him oh he's crazy bla bla bla and they went right in there and voted for him now when you talk about this this wealth redistribution by the government when you take that out there and and send out that message that message will get destroyed as being you know socialists on America and blah blah blah you name it any of the names that that Bernie Sanders was called right and these people America spoke when they voted for Trump and these people are not gonna vote for this these people still believe in that in that trickle-down theory you know they're they're suffering now from the tax cuts right you see funny thing going on in my opinion is all these teacher strikes and and these people like education being decimated in Arizona and Kentucky and I think it's Arkansas Oklahoma or whatever these are all red slates these are all states that voted oh we don't want to pay taxes well guess what your school suck yeah your teachers are underpaid you know what anyway cuz you don't want to pay you didn't want to pay that but are they the teachers are the one protesting are the people gonna vote you know you are the people willing to pay taxes to have good schools you know now on a poll they'll always say yes of course we would but when it when it actually comes down to doing it will they do it so this is a poll that that when you ask people like yet do you agree that there should be wealth redistribution and you know the 1% has all the money in the middle class should have more they're like yeah and then you say well we're gonna have to raise taxes on the 1% or on corporations it's very least getting the taxes back to where they were a couple months ago we'll see but so far America has been allergic to anything that says raise taxes on anybody even when it makes sense yeah yeah no III really see where Alonso is coming from on this I do think that these polls are there they're false positives in a way you sort of experience them there are a lot of them right now they're about they're regarding Trump's approval rating or what do you want in the country but it is true that when now I was gonna say what when the votes come up they they vote for lower taxes tax cuts or things masquerading as tax cuts right because this this last tax cut or tax redistribution is really just a redistribution to the top and then of course the tax cuts will have a sunset in the men they're not really across the board we know what a fraud that is so I'm kind of with I see your point John which is sort of we should be encouraged by this and maybe this is the beginning the stirrings of the electorate on mass beginning to change it's just that I really I'm kind of with Alonso on this I really don't see it in the voting booths and I certainly don't see it in the guys they're sending to Washington yeah look I do disagree I disagree for a couple of different reasons I think first of all so you mentioned the the support for the total trickle-down idea I think that there could theoretically if there could be some people who still believe in some level that's true but the recent tax bill has like twenty six percent approval rating like people overwhelmingly hate it that means that seven or eight points worth of Trump's core supporters don't support the tax bill which I think is positive and probably every other reasonable person in the country I think that in reference to them voting for Trump I think that well look realistically in terms of the actual policies when Hillary Clinton obviously is closer to these goals than Donald Trump Donald Trump tried to pitch himself as a person who was gonna go against Wall Street he was gonna take through the you know the pass through income and let some in he's lying about all that but he said it and I think that some people support him because he seemed more likely than Hillary Clinton to go against those wealthy to interest that's a fair point it was a populist message that's actually a very good point in that his fraud because our electorate is the way they are at least on the trumpian side of things they bought it or they hoped for it to be fair to them to give them the benefit of the doubt but uh you're right it was a populist message still the people that are sent to Washington who did pull off that tax steal I mean that it was an absolute robbery they are not reflecting the constituency that there's talked about in that poll and again I John I hope you're right I wish you were right but but when you have something like this when you have this issue wealth redistribution a pitted political revolution they can destroy this like oh they're gonna take your guns you know I mean like they come they say that but but see that works though you know what I mean like that that wipes out a percentage of people vote against their own interests it was proven in this past election they vote against their own it so they vote against their economic interests over some you know second amendment thing that was never said like no Democrat ever said oh we're coming to your house to take your guns but they got them to actually believe it so let let's turn briefly to so I agree with you I think that that message just wealth redistribution I think Republicans are primed to try to attack that and probably a lot of people are primed to listen to that but I think that when it's delivered it won't be delivered like that it'll be delivered in relation to particular things that this redistribution will be for that you'll get so let's let's turn to that and see if maybe that's a little bit more convincing this next chart is gonna show support for what that redistribution actually looked like so raising taxes on the wealthy is just about the most popular thing in the country even though you wouldn't again see from who they send in Washington our recent accident big corporations but then what would you spend an audible single-payer and free college for both very popular things that you can use that for and I think well I agree nobody wants their taxes to be higher and even if Bernie Sanders came out and said we are literally only raising taxes on the top 3 percent of all income earners they will try to convince you that your taxes will go up too I don't doubt that but if you then think well but I'm also gonna have free health care and maybe my kids can go to college for free I think that that is one way to reassure regular people that it will actually help them out in the end I don't know for sure this is just I do think that's been what your what you want to take from that is some of the message that should be screamed loudly in this next election cycle and I think that's what you're sort of implying it's just that I don't know I don't know how when it actually comes to the legislators that they send there's a disconnect these guys it was that they should have gotten ski masks and guns cuz bitten as you say that the country didn't support this tax cut but they just went through with it rockers are a bunch of rich guys taking care of other rich guys and hopefully they will play well beyond November the disconnect you're talking about and again this sounds great and this little sweeping disconnect you're talking about is lobbyists money exactly you know so you could tell somebody that yeah your kids gonna get your taxes are gonna go up a little but you're gonna get health care and your kids are gonna go to college for free and people like that's great that's worth it and then in between the lobbyists for college tuition goes to the congressman or legislator and says free college his ten million dollars saying college shouldn't be free and suddenly college isn't free you know so that that's the disconnect again I think it has a fan that and I hope I hope people support this but it's almost it's one of those things like how do you argue in this this came up when Bernie was running right there were people who were against free college you're like how do i how do you argue with somebody who's like what do you mean you're against freak like what's the downside you know Hillary's argument is plan it was that because technically the wealthy would also have access to it that that's a waste of my I went to UConn I don't think that like the Koch brothers grandkids are like well if I can go you got for free I'm gonna get was a ridiculous I can only go to UConn you're free if you're a great woman's basketball player we did have a lot of too easy ways for the Young
