of course from all that international intrigue now to the presidential pornstar stormy there are new developments on stormy Daniels 60 minutes appearance two sources tell the Washington Post that CBS will air her interview with Anderson Cooper on March 25th meanwhile the lawyer representing the former porn star Michael avenatti says six other women have come forward with stories that are quote strikingly similar to his clients he says at least two of them have non-disclosure agreements but admits he has not yet vetted their stories to a great degree the attorney also says he has not yet determined whether he intends to represent the other women the White House has denied all allegations of Affairs involving the president and Michael avenatti will be our guest on Morning Joe next hour so so Donnie it's interesting we talked about we've been talking about this story for months in it for whatever reason it couldn't get traction it was overshadowed by Russia and everything else going on but in the last couple of weeks because of the reports of the payment that Michael Cohen Trump's attorney has admitted to making he says it was his personal money not directed by the president he was just casually paying off a porn star for some reason and this interview with the 60 Minutes which I can tell you 60 minutes was never particularly threatened by the White House they were just doing journalism and reporting this story out what does this all add up to for the president at the end of the day I think Canley not that much actually I think what's baked into his brand obviously is we know he's a he's a philanderer we know he's a kind of a sleazebag we certainly did not have heard of getting elected and unless there are some striking visuals right which I doubt you know Donald Trump does not send emails he I would be very surprised if we're gonna see pictures of Donald Trump running around her sombrero and cowboy boots I mean I don't know I even went there was a broker half the things you say are confessional yes that's for another show well you're either projecting or you're you're being confession yeah III think this is can't get your confession thank you for tuning in so thank you sir barok ever was but I do think I just want to step a little back to the model thing for a second because we're still always bearing a lead wait wait wait well here you're actually Nick it gave you a chance to talk about the porn stuff for me Daniels and you want to go back I'm gonna do the independent council because oh they're out of character I don't know why she was wearing the Little Red Riding Hood outfit on when there was there was a tease what there was a tease on the Cole show the other day where they showed stormy okay okay okay see it and I'm trying to talk policy here okay we forget his 1992 Donald Trump went backwards okay right you are in the real estate business a Donald Trump loves debt I love debt that's research really he's not be able to borrow money for 25 years okay he's building he's doing business where is the money coming from it is always follow the money we could talk about bots we can talk about collusion we can talk about adoption it'll Donald Trump and dirty Russian money and dirty foreign money over 25 years of business that will bring this presidency down this is where Muller is scratching now and to me once he got to the trouble organization everything is gonna fall and it has nothing to do with sombreros and cowboy boots I just want to say that one more time all right Susan I'm gonna try and raise the bar here and talk about the Republican Party if Donny and all these investigations bear out including the stormy one I mean these Republicans who are following blindly along do they not see that these are serious there's like four or five serious possibilities of this president being on the wrong side of history and what does this mean for the party well I actually think that the party has their head in the sand because they think that this is a Donald Trump issue that it's part of his narrow end and I agree with you and nothing shows that more than what happened with the Intel investigation and those two political memos to come out I mean to me that's when speaker Ryan really said I'm done leading this this body taking a stance and unfortunately there's no Republican in office that is seeking re-election who is willing to stand up to Donald Trump again so of course we're talking about this is an issue of character but as I've been saying on the show even if it's cold and calculated and calloused I mean Donnie can tell you the best brand that hasn't been used in American politics today is the conservative that says you know what I stood up against the excesses of Barack Obama I stood up against the excesses of Bill Clinton and I'm gonna stand up against the excesses of Donald Trump and oh my god that person I don't care what polls say and I'm sure you'd agree with me here that person if they do it forcefully owns 50% of the Republican electorate in time that is basically the loyal opposition it is the loyal opposition and for some reason they're afraid to speak up they don't feel that they can have the traction that they need and is it 50 percent or is it 45 because it's and I agree that they have to keep going and frankly it's it's getting to be late we're going into the midterm elections until someone starts speaking up and really we see a candidate running for president primary Donald Trump yeah we're not going to see any real disco Joe as a column in The Washington Post this morning I won't read from it now but there's a quote this is I believe George HW yeah Jon Meacham trying to meet some writing about George aid stuff to take a look and I quoted I quoted Tommy James book and thank God he wasn't talking about Tyler and this is what he said the interview I was going back to the interview this past week of the Republican mayor who sounds really really good piece I'm gonna for Connor Lam because we need to send a good man they can watch anything make America good again which I actually think is the most great con pal campaign slogan of own trademark America and Republicans trade market America is great because America is good that's and when America stops being good America will no longer be great this is what Jon Meacham said that's what I said that interview brought to mind Pulitzer prize-winning historian Jon Meacham sprays of George HW Bush's leadership style that was meet some rights there is greatness and political lives dedicated more to steadiness than to boldness more to reform than to revolution what are the management of complexity than do the making of mass movements Bush's life code as he once put in a letter to his mother was tell the truth don't blame people be strong do your best try hard forgive stay the course Joe I wish that you look at the front page of the Boston Globe today and you see the chaos of those people and and David Ignatius you look at these pictures of all the people that have quit already there's more this looks like Watergate 1974 this this could be the front page of the Washington Post of the cast of characters that have moved yeah moving in and out of the White House it is absolute chaos there it's it's chaos I found a quote from from Trump recently that it shows that he delights in this he's quoted as saying I like conflict I like watching it I like seeing it and I think it's the way to go mm-hmm in other words this daily circus of people getting fired humiliated this one's about to be fired reality it's what the president wants now try hard stay the course so it's interesting when you said about be good let's make America good again the important thing to put into the good what Trump has twisted for people people have mistaken his bravado or whatever wars for strength let's associate good and strength right and that's what's got somebody's got to put cuz good can seem great is idly great is pounding your chest good is actually stronger than great yes it's solid and it's not exaggerated and Joe you just laid out I wish I can have a candidate I wish interesting a lot of the things that you talk about and your style I know you're not running for office but if I had a candidate that had good plus strength right done that's the killer gun also we talked about good I think it's also public service it's putting the country first not putting yourself first and that's what people are seeing in Washington that are so frustrated right now they just see the President on down putting their priorities before the country this is about public service and goodness by the way I retweet it a tweet last night from the op-ed editor of the New York Post and you know what he was writing about conservative guy what a conservatives conservative and he just said you know what I was fortunate to become a father in the middle of Barack Obama's administration because of the example he set for me as a father and a family man and a human being a guy who didn't agree probably with 10% of what Barack Obama said and yet look at that example and you have conservatives saying that now it is that the country is hungry for that person still ahead on morning joe the NCAA NCAA college basketball tournament tipped off yesterday but officials
