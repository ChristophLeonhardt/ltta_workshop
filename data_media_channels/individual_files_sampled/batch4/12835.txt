one of the reasons that you can see that Hollywood has shifted its view of itself is the change in in the demographic of the people who actually watch Oscar films so it used to be that Oscar films between 1983 and 2000 2003 really virtually every Oscar film was a major winner in terms of the box-office virtually every Oscar film did really well at the box-office at least the the films that won Best Picture right and so I'm gonna look up the list right now and I will tell you there has not been an actual good movie that is won Best Picture at the Oscars like a a great movie that's won best pictures at the Oscars in my opinion since 2010 and there hasn't been a box office winner at the Oscars for nearly 15 years for nearly 15 years it's really an amazing amazing thing I mean let's let's look back at the at the Best Picture winners so 2016 the best winter picture was the Best Picture winner was moonlight which made like 5 bucks at the box office before that it was spotlight fine movie completely forgettable you know again I enjoyed spotlight I think moonlight is a fine film it was obviously the social justice winner because it was about gay black people in the inner city whatever that's fine but that's not exactly designed to be a box office busting winner ok spotlight one the one the year before that the year before that it was Birdman which I thought it was just an ex Korbel film I just thought it's an awful awful movie 12 years of slave which i think is a very good movie but I'm not obviously one that's gonna bust down the box off his doors but it's it's about slavery it is not a highly entertaining film I think it's a well-made film I don't think it's as well made as for example shown there's less but 12 years of slaves a good movie but is it like an all-time classic movie probably not Argo which is completely forgettable now do you even remember Argo I remember one it won like I saw it it's fine it's fun but it's not like it's an Argo is not an important movie the artist right and none of these movies made more than five dollars at the box office The King's Speech was the last really great movie that I think was was a big winner but the Oscars The Hurt Locker was the year before that Slumdog Millionaire which did decently at the box office but won over like The Dark Knight are you kidding me okay are you kidding me it hasn't even that was 2008 okay it's been 10 years does anyone even watch Slumdog Millionaire now it's a fine film I mean I enjoyed it but it's not the Dark Knight hey No Country for Old Men is 2007 that was the last big box office winner that actually did really really well at the Oscars there's no country for immense that's 2007 and before that was the departed which may take crash the worst movie of all time hey Million Dollar Baby again okay but sorry movies about euthanasia don't exactly blow it up at the box office though and then you get it by 2003 I think it was really in the bush here that this happened 2003 by the middle of the Bush era you can see the shift for Hollywood the shift goes from we are here to make movies that entertain you too we are here to make movies that are specifically designed to say something say something important because before 2003 all of the movies that were winning we're big box-office winners the reason this is important is the people in Hollywood the people who vote at the Academy Awards see their role differently they see their role in life seriously as we are here in order to in order not to make big movies that make lots of money and earn us all enormous paychecks that's something nice that we do but we're really hard to do is push the message and you can see that from the Oscar winners because before that it was lord of the Rings Return of the King it was gladiator it was Shakespeare in Love which did really well was Titanic it was Braveheart it was Forrest Gump it was Schindler's List in Unforgiven it was Silence of the Lambs it was Dances with Wolves right every other year it was in top five to top ten box office movie that was winning and we haven't had one of those in like 15 years okay there's a reason for that and it's because Hollywood does have messages it wants to promote so we're gonna talk about some of the messages that they wanted to promote at the Oscars last night
