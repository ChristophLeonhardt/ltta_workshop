>> Shepard: CONTINUING COVERAGE
ON FOX'S TOP STORY.
DEADLY PROTESTS IN GAZA AS
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOLLOWING
THROUGH ON HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE
TO MOVE THE U.S. EMBASSY TO
JERUSALEM.
LET'S GO TO JOHN ALTERMAN FROM A
BIPARTISAN RESEARCH
ORGANIZATION.
HE SERVED AT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT UNDER PRESIDENT
GEORGE W. BUSH AS A MEMBER OF
THE POLICY PLANNING STAFF.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> GOOD TO BE BACK.
THANK YOU, SHEP.
>> Shepard: YOUR THOUGHTS ON
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT.
>> YOU KNOW, I GUESS THE BIGGEST
QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION REALLY TRYING TO
DO?
A BIG POLITICAL GIFT FOR PRIME
MINISTER FOR NETANYAHU.
>> Shepard: WHICH IT IS.
>> SETS BACK THE
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ENGAGE
ON PEACE MAKING.
EUROPEANS HAVE BECOME MORE
ALIENATED.
YOU CAN ARGUE IT DOESN'T MATTER,
MAYBE IT DOES.
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THIS FITS
INTO A BROADER SCHEME OF THINGS
EXCEPT TO SAY THIS IS A VERY
UNCONVENTIONAL ADMINISTRATION.
>> Shepard: HISTORICALLY THIS
HAS BEEN SEEN AS THE KIND OF
THING YOU DO IN EXCHANGE FOR
SOMETHING ELSE.
IS THAT RIGHT?
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
PRIZE, THE ONE WHERE PEOPLE
COULD SLICE AND DICE IT ANY
NUMBER OF WAYS.
YOU WANT IT TO BE A CLOSER, NOT
YOUR OPENING BID.
IF IT'S YOUR OPENING BID, IT
ENDS UP NOT BEING VERY VALUABLE
UNLESS YOU REALLY CHANGE THE
ENVIRONMENT.
EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN IN THE LAST
SEVERAL MONTHS SUGGESTS IT
HASN'T CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENT.
YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS BREAK DOWN
IN POLITICS.
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE
GALVANIZED A MOVEMENT TO CHANGE
THINGS.
IT SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN THE PRIME
MINISTER A BOOST AND FRANKLY
GIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP A LITTLE
BIT OF A POLITICAL BOOST IN THE
UNITED STATES.
>> Shepard: BY WAY OF EXAMPLE,
600,000 OR SO ISRAELIS NOW LIVE
IN SETTLEMENTS IN THE OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES IN PALESTINIAN
LANDS.
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
IF FOR INSTANCE THE IT'S RAIL
IF FOR INSTANCE THE IT'S RAI
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRS RAI
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRAERAI
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRAELII
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRAELIS
ABANDON THE SETTLEMENTS, THIS
WAS LIKE THE KIND OF THING YOU'D
GIVE IN RETURN, RIGHT?
>> EVERYBODY BELIEVES THERE WILL
BE LAND SWAPS.
SOME WILL LEAVE THE WEST BANK
WHEN YOU GET TO A DEAL.
SEEMS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE THAT
WE GO TO HEAR FROM GETTING A
DEAL WITHOUT REAL CHANGE IN THE
SITUATION ON THE GROUND, WHICH
UNFORTUNATELY MAY BE SOME SORT
OF VIOLENCE PERPETRATED ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.
I'M NOT SURE HOW WE GET THERE
FROM HERE BECAUSE OF A SENSE
THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS GIVEN
UP THE IDEA OF BEING BETWEEN THE
PARTIES AND INSTEAD HAS ADOPTED
A THEORY THAT THE PROBLEM THAT
ISRAEL IS TOO WEAK AND BE SIEGED
AND THE PALESTINIANS ARE TOO
STRONG.
MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT'S NOT THE
