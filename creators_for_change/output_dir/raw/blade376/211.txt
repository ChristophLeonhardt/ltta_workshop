<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to think of where to start</font>

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,020
because the main thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this clip</font>

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,449
that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to take away and know is</font>

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,539
that I know what you've been up to and I

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,539
know who you are and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

6
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,670
you've done is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a negative</font>

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,000
impact on my life i guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have faith</font>

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">in people that you know people do have</font>

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,559
good intentions or when they do go

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,180
astray that they have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,760
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> things for the better and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a reality check and an</font>

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,399
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to respond you know</font>

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,910
privately I'm not saying here you are

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,930
but you watch my videos you know people

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,190
that I know and you like to write on

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,680
forums you like to chat behind my back

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,370
about how you know people mock me behind

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,949
my back and how I don't deserve<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,100
where I'd be and how I'm a waste of

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,170
space and how next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see me</font>

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,960
gonna beat the hell out of me and I just

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,920
find that remarkably I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,409
how do i categorize that what would be

25
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,810
your motivation to do that because to be

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,450
honest and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't take any ego for</font>

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">me to say this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that</font>

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,220
it's insecurity on your part you've

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,689
obviously got issues you've obviously

30
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,470
either got nothing better to do you've

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,990
got a chip on your shoulder or well

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,909
similar to the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've just said or</font>

33
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,570
you're just jealous and they're really

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,390
need isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> any need for any of it I mean</font>

35
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,630
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of what you've criticized me for</font>

36
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,560
is for my successes and I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,290
interesting because to be completely

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,860
honest I'm completely grateful for what

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,990
I've achieved I've put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,810
hard-working but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day</font>

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">all I want people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take away from this</font>

42
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how everyone has the opportunity to</font>

43
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,840
do what I do because I'm just using the

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,080
internet and even you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font>

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do</font>

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,629
but instead you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want some mock you</font>

47
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,170
want to criticize in forums and that

48
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,810
hidden away as if you know that's giving

49
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,959
you empowerment<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if you know that</font>

50
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,349
gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Authority and a lot of people</font>

51
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be asking why I'm wasting my breath</font>

52
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,340
on you and I guess it just goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,099
where I was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning I just want</font>

54
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to know that I know who you are I</font>

55
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,540
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've been up to so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,799
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you the opportunity if you want</font>

57
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:46,410
to be a decent individual if you want to

58
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,890
UM act your<font color="#E5E5E5"> age because you are older</font>

59
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,290
than me and I know age physically

60
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't mean anything it's all about</font>

61
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,010
maturity but even in that sense what you

62
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,030
do is extremely immature not saying that

63
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,859
I'm the most mature of people all times

64
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,530
but when I am immature it isn't that the

65
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,049
expense of others and it's not about

66
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting other people down and therefore</font>

67
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,470
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ever do me because I know who you</font>

68
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">are um I'd be more than happy to chat</font>

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,150
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but if you want to bring out</font>

70
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,150
violence like you keep preaching with

71
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,650
the people that keep egging you on on

72
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,359
these forums about how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should kick</font>

73
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,049
my ass than that then so be it but I

74
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,480
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a much bigger testament to</font>

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,669
what sort of person you are then what

76
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,500
sort of person I am because you

77
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,660
obviously have nothing better to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

78
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,549
your life and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving you the</font>

79
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,109
opportunity to sort of reflect on that

80
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,299
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stick with your band</font>

81
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,519
keep promoting it easy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> snakes it's a</font>

82
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,859
great medium to do it on and actually

83
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,489
maybe not judge me on videos which are

84
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,950
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas and concepts but</font>

85
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,200
maybe realize that I could be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

86
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">right guy and if you know your reasons</font>

87
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,859
for preaching hate go under anything

88
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">other than being jealous having</font>

89
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,930
insecurities or having a chip on your

90
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,079
shoulder then I'd be interested to hear

91
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,139
thoughts and to think right now i<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

92
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,849
probably contact you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really wanted</font>

93
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:17,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to but i chose to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

94
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,918
because i know you like to watch my

95
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,019
videos waiting for the next opportunity

96
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to criticize me so criticize this go for</font>

97
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,860
it
