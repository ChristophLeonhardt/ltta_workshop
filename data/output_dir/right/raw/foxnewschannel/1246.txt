1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:06,807
LIVE IT FOR HER.

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,876
>> I'M JOINED BY MEADOW

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,512
POLLACK'S DAD, ANDREW POLLACK.

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,647
I'M SO EMOTIONAL WATCHING YOUR

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:14,382
DAUGHTER'S FRIENDS, I CAN ONLY

6
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:15,549
IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOU,

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,617
ANDREW.

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,887
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW ANGRY

9
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,289
AND UPSET I AM TODAY.

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,392
I'M HAVING A ROUGH DAY WITH THIS

11
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,594
GRADUATION THAT'S GOING TO GO ON

12
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:26,961
TOMORROW.

13
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,229
I WASN'T PREPARED TO HEAR ALL

14
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:33,067
THAT STUFF ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.

15
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,969
I'M ANGRY WITH ALL THIS

16
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,837
INCOMPETENCE THAT MY DAUGHTER'S

17
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,972
NOT GETTING HER DIPLOMA

18
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:38,339
TOMORROW.

19
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,473
IT'S MY SON THAT HAS TO GET IT

20
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,643
ON THAT STAGE.

21
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:43,511
SO IT'S TOUGH.

22
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,578
>> I CAN IMAGINE.

23
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,147
YOU KNOW, WE ALL JUST GIVE YOU

24
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,115
SO MUCH CREDIT FOR HOW STRONG

25
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:48,649
YOU'VE BEEN.

26
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,051
OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE A

27
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,452
VERY HARD DAY.

28
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,954
YOU LISTENED TO HER FRIENDS, WHO

29
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:54,555
I'M SURE --

30
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,157
>> THEY'RE GREAT KIDS.

31
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,691
>> REALLY GREAT KIDS.

32
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,527
EVERYBODY IS PROUD OF THEM.

33
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:00,694
YOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD BE ON THAT

34
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:00,995
STAGE.

35
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:01,328
>> YEAH.

36
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,930
>> THE STORY THAT I MENTIONED ON

37
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,864
THE WAY IN HERE, ABOUT THE

38
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,967
PARAMEDICS, YOU KNOW, I TALKED

39
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,035
TO GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT

40
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,570
YESTERDAY, OR THE DAY BEFORE,

41
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,371
ABOUT WHAT'S BEING DONE IN

42
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,173
FLORIDA TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER

43
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:12,640
HAPPENS AGAIN.

44
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,808
THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT YOU

45
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,509
WORKED VERY HARD TO PASS, BUT,

46
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,079
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO ASK

47
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,113
YOURSELF, WHAT HAPPENED AT THE

48
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:19,880
BROWARD SHERIFF'S OFFICE WHEN

49
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,681
THEY'RE NOT LETTING THE

50
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,949
PARAMEDICS IN, AND NOW WE KNOW

51
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,251
THAT THAT GUY WAS OUT OF THE

52
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,286
BUILDING SOME TIME BEFORE THAT,

53
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,487
RIGHT?

54
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:27,688
>> YEAH.

55
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,457
WELL, THEY COULDN'T LET THEM IN

56
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:30,991
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT -- YOU

57
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,060
KNOW, THE ONE DEPUTY THAT WORKED

58
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,062
AT THE SCHOOL DIDN'T GO IN.

59
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,364
SO HE HID BEHIND THE WALL, AND

60
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,732
THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE STILL

61
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,401
WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER IN THERE

62
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,368
BECAUSE HE WAS STILL HIDING

63
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,170
BEHIND THE WALL, THE DEPUTY THAT

64
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,606
WAS AT THE BUILDING AT THE TIME.

65
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,942
SO, YOU KNOW, THE PARAMEDICS,

66
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,543
THEY HAD THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR

67
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,178
THEM THAT DAY BECAUSE THE

68
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,713
SHERIFF AT THE SCHOOL DIDN'T DO

69
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,314
HIS JOB.

70
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,483
AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T

71
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,084
DO THEIR JOBS EITHER, MARTHA.

72
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,453
THEY HAVE MONITORS AT THAT

73
00:01:59,453 --> 00:01:59,787
SCHOOL.

74
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,589
AN ARTICLE CAME OUT TODAY ABOUT

75
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:02,990
A MONITOR THAT WORKS AT THAT

76
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,826
SCHOOL THAT DIDN'T DO HIS JOB

77
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:06,260
EITHER.

78
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,098
HE SAW A GENTLEMAN, WALK OUT OF

79
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,766
A CAR, ON TO THE SCHOOL GROUNDS,

80
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,369
WITH A RIFLE BAG, AND DIDN'T

81
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,204
CALL A CODE RED OR CALL THE

82
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:17,538
POLICE.

83
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,708
HE DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE AFTER

84
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,809
HE HEARD GUNSHOTS.

85
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,544
JUST ANOTHER LEVEL OF

86
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,613
INCOMPETENCE AT THAT SCHOOL.

87
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,881
THAT GENTLEMAN STILL WORKS AT

88
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,449
THE SCHOOL, AND HAS HIS JOB.

89
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,517
>> YOU'RE KIDDING?

90
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,185
>> IT WAS UPSETTING SEEING THAT

91
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:31,685
ARTICLE.

92
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:31,986
YEAH.

93
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,187
HE'S STILL AT THE SCHOOL.

94
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,822
NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR NOT

95
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:35,756
CALLING THE POLICE.

96
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,625
JUST GETTING ON A RADIO.

97
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,225
AFTER HEARING GUNSHOTS.

98
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,560
IF YOU READ THE ARTICLE THAT

99
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,229
CAME OUT TODAY, IT IS UNREAL,

100
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,063
AND IT'S UPSETTING.

101
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:43,964
>> WOW.

102
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:44,298
UNREAL.

103
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,699
>> EVERY DAY THERE'S ANOTHER

104
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,467
ARTICLE COMING OUT.

105
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,568
THERE'S A VIDEO GAME.

106
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,370
THEN THERE'S A VIDEO ON THE

107
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:49,803
PHONE.

108
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,605
SO, YOU KNOW, ALL THE FAMILIES,

109
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,307
EVERY DAY THEY'RE RELIVING

110
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:53,774
SOMETHING NEW.

111
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,875
THIS WEEKEND IT HAPPENS TO BE

112
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,809
GRADUATION.

113
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,077
>> SO SORRY.

114
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,646
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A MOMENT AT

115
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,048
THE WHITE HOUSE, I KNOW YOU WENT

116
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,950
TO THAT FIRST GATHERING RIGHT

117
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,119
AFTER THE SHOOTING, AND YOU WERE

118
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,087
SO STRONG, STANDING THERE WITH

119
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,689
YOUR SONS, TALKING TO PRESIDENT

120
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,056
TRUMP.

121
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,391
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AT THE

122
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,158
WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING THIS

123
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,664
WEEK.

124
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:20,467
>> MENTAL HEALTH IS MORE ABOUT

125
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,303
THE FACT THAT WE COULD GET SHOT

126
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,337
AT SCHOOL.

127
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,505
SPECIFICALLY CAN YOU TELL ME

128
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,506
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE

129
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,741
AND WILL DO TO PREVENT THESE

130
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:28,309
SENSELESS TRAGEDIES?

131
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,344
>> I THINK THAT AS A KID, AND

132
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,979
CERTAINLY AS A PARENT, THERE IS

133
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,248
NOTHING THAT COULD BE MORE

134
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,583
TERRIFYING FOR A KID TO GO TO

135
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,784
SCHOOL AND NOT FEEL SAFE.

136
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,052
I'M SORRY THAT YOU FEEL THAT

137
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,553
WAY.

138
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,822
THIS ADMINISTRATION TAKES IT

139
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,690
SERIOUSLY.

140
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,391
AND THE SCHOOL SAFETY COMMISSION

141
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,061
THAT THE PRESIDENT CONVENED IS

142
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:47,828
MEETING THIS WEEK.

143
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,263
>> YOU CAN HEAR HER GET

144
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,664
EMOTIONAL WHEN SHE RESPONDED TO

145
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,266
THAT LITTLE CHILD.

146
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,501
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK

147
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,336
ABOUT HOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS

148
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,537
DOING ON WHAT YOU WERE PROMISED

149
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,238
SO FAR?

150
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,640
>> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THIS,

151
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,075
THE PRESIDENT DID LISTEN, AND HE

152
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,276
PUT A COMMISSION TOGETHER.

153
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,144
BUT TALK IS CHEAP RIGHT NOW IN

154
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,312
THIS COUNTRY.

155
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,381
I'M TIRED OF HEARING TALK.

156
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,149
I'M TIRED OF ROUNDTABLES.

157
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,818
WE NEED METAL DETECTORS AND

158
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,319
ARMED GUARDS AT THE SCHOOL.

159
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,354
IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET

160
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,389
SCIENTIST TO FIGURE OUT THAT ANY

161
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,656
KID COULD WALK INTO A SCHOOL ANY

162
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,259
DAY OF THE WEEK WITH A WEAPON, A

163
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:23,097
KNIFE, A HATCHET, A GUN HOW ARE

164
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,332
OUR KIDS SAFE WITHOUT METAL

165
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,101
DETECTORS AND SINGLE ENTRY

166
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,036
SO THAT'S WHAT WE NEED, MARTHA.

167
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:35,976
I LAID IT OUT ON MY PLAN,

168
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:36,543
AMERICANSFORCLASS.ORG.

169
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,145
>> WE URGE EVERYBODY TO GO

170
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:38,445
THERE.

171
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,847
WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE

172
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,249
HELPFUL IN ANY WAY WE CAN.

173
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,550
ANDREW, THANK YOU.

174
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,985
WE'LL BE THINKING YOU ABOUT THIS

175
00:04:44,985 --> 00:00:00,000
WEEKEND.
