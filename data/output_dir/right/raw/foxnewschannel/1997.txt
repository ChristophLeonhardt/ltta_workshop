1
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:13,220
>> Shepard: BY THE WAY, ALL OF

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,257
YOU HAVE BEEN RESPONDING ON THE

3
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:20,694
PULLOUT OF THE IRAN DEAL, THE

4
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:22,663
RECKLESS DECISION TODAY MAKES A

5
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,264
WORLD LESS SAFE BY WITHDRAWING

6
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,833
FROM THE JCP OH, OUR PRESIDENT

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,801
IS UNDERMINING AMERICAN

8
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:29,670
CREDIBILITY AND ISOLATING US

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,372
FROM OUR PARTNERS AND ALLIES AND

10
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:34,474
ABANDONING COMMITMENTS UNDER

11
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:35,075
THIS AGREEMENT.

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:36,677
WE DID REACH OUT TO MR. PEREZ TO

13
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:38,078
SEE IF HE COULD JOIN US ON THE

14
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,080
SHOW BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,480
HEARD BACK.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,216
WE DID HEAR BACK FROM THE RNC

17
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:45,519
CHAIRWOMAN JOINS US RIGHT NOW.

18
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,487
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.

19
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:48,155
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

20
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:50,691
>> Shepard: WHAT DO YOU THINK

21
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:52,726
ABOUT THAT REACTION, ALMOST

22
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:54,461
UNIVERSAL CONDEMNATION FROM THAT

23
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,463
SIDE, ODDLY ENOUGH INCLUDING

24
00:00:56,463 --> 00:00:57,197
CHUCK SCHUMER WHO WAS ORIGINALLY

25
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:58,365
AGAINST THE DEAL, ONE OF THE

26
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:01,468
FOUR DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED AGAINST

27
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:04,571
BARACK OBAMA'S DEAL ON THIS.

28
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:05,839
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

29
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:07,874
>> CHUCK SCHUMER IS PLAYING HIS

30
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,076
PARTISAN ROLE.

31
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:11,278
THE REALITY IS THAT THE OBAMA

32
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:12,479
ADMINISTRATION ENTERED INTO A

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,480
RECKLESS DEAL WITH IRAN, ONE

34
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,251
THAT MADE THE WORLD LEFT BASED.

35
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:23,457
THEY DIDN'T PUT THE PROPER

36
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:24,858
INSPECTIONS IN PLACE, AND THESE

37
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:26,293
ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO PUT IN

38
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:29,262
PLACE TO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY.

39
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:30,464
IRAN HAS CONTINUED TO FUND

40
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:32,132
TERRORISM AND NOT BEEN GOOD

41
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:32,466
ACTORS.

42
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:33,700
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED

43
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,735
ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TODAY AND

44
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:36,203
SAID WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND

45
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:38,672
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN

46
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:41,174
A DEAL THAT IF WE GO BACK TO THE

47
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,510
DEAL WITH IRAN MAKES THE WORLD

48
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,877
SAFER.

49
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:45,278
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BARACK OBAMA

50
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:46,680
SHOULD HAVE DONE, AND

51
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,050
PRESIDENT TRUMP ONCE AGAIN IS

52
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,251
TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE

53
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:52,319
WORLD AND CORRECTING THE

54
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,354
MISTAKES OF THE OBAMA

55
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:55,055
ADMINISTRATION.

56
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:57,624
>> Shepard: IF THE 90-180 DAY

57
00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:00,060
WAITING PERIOD DOES NOT PRODUCE

58
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,662
ANY RESULTS, OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF

59
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,096
BUSINESS DEALS MADE WITH IRAN

60
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:04,464
WOULD BE BROKEN AND WE COULDN'T

61
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:06,199
HONOR THEM, AND THAT INCLUDES

62
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,068
BOEING WHICH HAS A NUMBER OF

63
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:08,769
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR CONTRACTS

64
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:11,271
WITH THE IRANIANS.

65
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:13,674
WHAT ARE WE TELLING BOEING, WHAT

66
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,876
ARE WE TELLING THESE AMERICAN

67
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,244
COMPANIES?

68
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:19,246
THAT WILL BE UP TO THE

69
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:19,946
ADMINISTRATION TO COMMUNICATE

70
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:23,817
WITH PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THOSE

71
00:02:23,817 --> 00:02:25,052
DEALS.

72
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:26,053
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS

73
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:27,254
THE LEADER IN THE WORLD AGAIN

74
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:29,523
AND HE'S DONE IT WITH SYRIA

75
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,825
COMPANIES DOING IT NOW WITH IRAN

76
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:32,359
COMPANIES DOING IT NOW WITH IRA

77
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,560
IRAN, AND HE HAS SAID WE ARE NOT

78
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,461
GOING TO STAND FOR BAD ACTORS

79
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:35,395
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE

80
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:38,665
DEALS THAT ARE NOT MAKING OUR

81
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:39,866
WORLD SAVIOR.

82
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:40,967
HE HAS MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN ALL

83
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:44,237
OF THOSE FRONTS AND HE DELIVERED

84
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,472
ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND I

85
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,140
THINK WE WILL COME OUT WITH A

86
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,677
SAFER WORLD BECAUSE OF TODAY.

87
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,379
>> Shepard: WE HAVE ALL THESE

88
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,246
PRIMARIES GOING ON TONIGHT IN

89
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:56,083
FOUR DIFFERENT STATES.

90
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,285
EIGHT MORE NEXT WEEK, DOZENS

91
00:02:58,285 --> 00:02:59,486
MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

92
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:01,421
DO YOU THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE

93
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,558
THAT WILL AFFECT VOTERS OR IS IT

94
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,660
JUST REALLY THE ECONOMY?

95
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,261
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE PAYING

96
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,664
ATTENTION TO WHAT THE

97
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:11,865
PRESIDENT HAS DONE WITH

98
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,467
COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH KOREA.

99
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:15,035
AND WITH SYRIA TAKING THAT

100
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:15,802
DEFINITIVE ACTION WHEN THEY USE

101
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:17,337
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

102
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:18,572
BUT I DO THINK THE ECONOMY IS

103
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:22,442
THE OVERRIDING ISSUE.

104
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,578
PEOPLE IN STATES LIKE OHIO,

105
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,079
WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA

106
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,314
WHO ARE VOTING TODAY, THEY KNOW

107
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:28,515
THAT JOBS ARE COMING BACK TO

108
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:29,950
THEIR STATES, THEY KNOW THAT

109
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,853
WAGES ARE UP AND PEOPLE ARE

110
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:33,720
GETTING BETTER PAYCHECKS AND

111
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,055
THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE THE

112
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:35,956
COUNTRY IS GOING.

113
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,691
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL SEE NOT

114
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,992
JUST THROUGH THE PRIMARY SEASON

115
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:39,760
BUT THROUGH NOVEMBER WHEN THEY

116
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,897
GO TO THE BALLOT BOX AND SAY,

117
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:48,668
WHO IS THE PARTY THAT DELIVERED?

118
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,837
AND THEY WILL HAVE TO ANSWER TO

119
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:53,273
THEIR VOTERS FOR THAT.

120
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:56,676
>> Shepard: THE FORMER COAL

121
00:03:56,676 --> 00:03:57,377
INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE WHO WAS IN

122
00:03:57,377 --> 00:04:04,151
PRISON FOR, DOES HE PROVIDE

123
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,720
SAFETY STANDARDS THAT LED TO

124
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,890
THAT COAL INDUSTRY ACCIDENT

125
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,423
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

126
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:12,659
IF HE WINS, WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE

127
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,093
HIM, WHAT THE

128
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:14,161
PRESIDENT RECOGNIZE HIM AS A

129
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:18,197
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR SENATOR

130
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:21,968
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR SENATOR ?

131
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:22,702
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF

132
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:25,005
ANY ELECTION TAKING PLACE

133
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:25,705
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE OUT VOTING,

134
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:29,442
BUT WE WILL SUPPORT NOMINEES

135
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:31,678
THAT FURTHER PRESIDENT'S AGENDA.

136
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:34,481
WE KNOW JOE MANSION WON'T DO

137
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,116
THAT, AND HE WOULD VOTE FOR

138
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,885
CHUCK SCHUMER TO BE THE LEADER.

139
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:40,453
SO LET'S MAKE SURE THE VOTERS

140
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:42,722
HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT

141
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:45,091
DECISION WITHOUT WEIGHING IN

142
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:48,395
BEFORE THE VOTE IS DONE.

143
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,729
>> Shepard: UNDERSTOOD, BUT IF

144
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,299
HE IS THE GUY, YOU WOULD STILL

145
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:55,268
PREFER HIM TO JOE MITCH?

146
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:57,170
>> I'M GOING TO SUPPORT PEOPLE

147
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,039
WHO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S

148
00:04:59,039 --> 00:04:59,372
AGENDA.

149
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,273
JOE MANSION TALKS A GOOD GAME

150
00:05:00,273 --> 00:05:02,475
BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THOSE

151
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,911
VOTES, HE VOTED NO FOR HIGHER

152
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:07,080
WAGES, MORE JOBS, A BETTER

153
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,414
ECONOMY.

154
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:11,451
HE HAS VOTED NO AGAINST HIS

155
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,686
STATE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

156
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:14,888
I THINK HE IS A NICE GUY, I HAVE

157
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:15,889
HIM OVER FOR A BARBECUE BUT

158
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,290
DON'T SEND HIM BACK TO THE

159
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,891
SENATE.

160
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,860
I LOVE THESE MAY PRIMARIES

161
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,798
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO FIND WHO

162
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:27,100
ARE ENEMIES ARE GOING TO BE AND

163
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,301
COALESCE AROUND THEM.

164
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,203
COME TOGETHER, WE NEED ALL HANDS

165
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:32,672
ON DECK BECAUSE WE NEED TO BEAT

166
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:33,373
THAT DEMOCRAT INCUMBENTS AND

167
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:36,109
GIVE THE PRESIDENT MORE HELP IN

168
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:36,509
THE SENATE.

169
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,244
>> Shepard: YOU PROBABLY HEAR

170
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:38,879
THE BACK AND FORTH AS

171
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,980
JOHN McCAIN HAS BEEN PLANNING

172
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,883
HIS OWN FUNERAL, APPARENTLY,

173
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:43,617
SUFFERING FROM BRAIN CANCER.

174
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,887
YOU KNOW THE STORY.

175
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:48,088
BUT HE HAS APPARENTLY MADE KNOWN

176
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,923
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE

177
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:51,057
PRESIDENT AT HIS FUNERAL.

178
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:53,093
THE VICE PRESIDENT, YES.

179
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,895
BUT NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

180
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:56,763
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

181
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:59,866
>> I HAVE A HARD TIME WEIGHING

182
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,302
ON ON SOMETHING I'M NOT PRIVY TO

183
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:02,669
FIRSTHAND.

184
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,071
I THINK RIGHT NOW, THE WHOLE

185
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,273
COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE

186
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:07,507
JOHN McCAIN AND HIS FAMILY AND

187
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,042
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.

188
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:11,278
HE'S AN AMERICAN HERO, HE

189
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:12,746
SUFFERING THROUGH OBVIOUSLY A

190
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,147
VERY SERIOUS BRAIN TUMOR AND

191
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:14,681
CANCER.

192
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:15,582
WE WANT HIM TO HEAL.

193
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,217
I DON'T WANT TO BE THINKING

194
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,386
ABOUT HIS FUNERAL, I WANT TO BE

195
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,288
THINKING ABOUT HIS RECOVERY.

196
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,789
>> Shepard: THE SAME APPLIED

197
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:24,691
TO HIS REGRETS APPARENTLY IN HIS

198
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:27,260
BOOK ABOUT PICKING SARAH PALIN,

199
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,961
ALTHOUGH HE HAS GREAT RESPECT

200
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:30,196
AND ADMIRATION FOR HER STILL,

201
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:31,598
THAT MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE PICKED

202
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,100
JOE LIEBERMAN AS HIS RUNNING

203
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,401
MATE?

204
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,903
>> I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HIS

205
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:37,771
BOOK, OBVIOUSLY HE HAD AN

206
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:39,572
HISTORIC CAREER IN THE SENATE,

207
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:42,075
AND BEFORE THAT SERVING OUR

208
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:42,642
COUNTRY.

209
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,177
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING

210
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:45,979
HIS INSIGHTS ON WHAT HE WISHES

211
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,080
HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY.

212
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,083
I WISH HE HAD A VOTED AGAINST

213
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,284
OBAMACARE, OF COURSE, BUT IT

214
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:52,686
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW

215
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:56,690
HIS BOOK COMES OUT.

216
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,457
OVERWHELMINGLY, THIS COUNTRY IS

217
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,125
THINKING ABOUT HIM AND HOPING HE

218
00:06:59,125 --> 00:06:59,492
RECOVERS.

219
00:06:59,492 --> 00:00:00,000
HE IS IN OUR AND PRAYERS.
