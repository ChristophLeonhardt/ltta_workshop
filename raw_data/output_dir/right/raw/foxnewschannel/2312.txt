1
00:00:00,916 --> 00:00:02,284
THROUGHOUT THIS HOUR WITH ALL OF

2
00:00:02,284 --> 00:00:03,385
MY GUESTS.

3
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:06,989
BUT FIRST MY OPENING STATEMENT.

4
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:11,693
HE'S A LIAR, HE'S A LEAKER, AND

5
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:13,495
HE'S A LEFTIST LIBERAL.

6
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:16,131
IF ANYONE WAS NOT CONVINCED THE

7
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:19,735
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JIM COMEY'S

8
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:22,271
INVOLVEMENT IN THE ATTEMPTED

9
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,440
COUP FROM WITHIN OUR OWN

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,442
GOVERNMENT OF THE DULY ELECTED

11
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:30,145
WINNER OF THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL

12
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:31,680
ELECTION, I HAVE JUST ONE

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,915
QUESTION FOR YOU.

14
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:36,885
ARE YOU STUPID?

15
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:40,055
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY HIS

16
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:41,857
BOOK OR ARGUE WITH OUR LIBERAL

17
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:43,859
FRIEND ASSUMING YOU STILL HAVE

18
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:44,860
ANY LEFT.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,463
JUST LISTEN UP.

20
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,498
COMEY'S BOOK TOUR WAS SUPPOSED

21
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:52,134
TO CONVINCE US HE IS AN

22
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:57,206
HONORABLE, LIKEABLE, DESCENT MAN

23
00:00:57,206 --> 00:01:03,378
DOING HIS DARNEDEST TO PROTECT

24
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:07,749
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE

25
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:08,550
NATION.

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,420
COMEY WOULD HIT THE TRAIL, THE

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,056
BOOKSTORES AND THE TV STUDIOS

28
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:16,525
MAKING CLEAR WHEN HE WAS THE TOP

29
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:19,361
OF THE PERCH AT THE FBI, HE DID

30
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,797
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

31
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:23,899
UNFORTUNATELY FOR JIM, IT DIDN'T

32
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:25,667
QUITE WORK OUT AS PLANNED.

33
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,403
IN FACT THE MAN IS IN REAL LEGAL

34
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:30,439
JEOPARDY WITH HIS LEAKS BEING

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,974
INVESTIGATED BY THE JUSTICE

36
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:32,541
DEPARTMENT.

37
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,510
NOT THAT I HAVE ANY FAITH IN

38
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,178
SESSIONS AND COMPANY THAT THEY

39
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:38,614
WILL EVER DO ANYTHING OF

40
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,482
CONSEQUENCE REGARDING THIS

41
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:41,350
FIASCO.

42
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,818
BUT LAST WEEK YOU REMEMBER I

43
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:45,988
TOLD YOU THERE WAS NOTHING,

44
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:50,993
ZILCH, ZERO, NADA IN COMEY'S

45
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:53,295
TWO-PAGE MEMO OF HIS MEETING

46
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:55,297
WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT IN ANY

47
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:57,199
WAY, SHAPE OR FORM THAT

48
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,400
INCRIMINATED PRESIDENT TRUMP.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,635
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

50
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:02,070
THE PRESIDENT DENIED EVERYTHING

51
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,071
INVOLVING RUSSIA.

52
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,574
WANTED THE INVESTIGATION

53
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:08,342
VIGOROUSLY PURSUED AND HE WANTED

54
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:11,413
LEAKERS PROSECUTED.

55
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,848
SO WHAT DOES HE DO?

56
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:16,952
HE WALKS OUT AND LEAKS TO HIS

57
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:18,086
LAW SCHOOL PAL.

58
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,788
BUT HE'S NOT A LEAKER.

59
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:21,423
CHECK THIS ONE OUT.

60
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:24,426
BRET: BUT YOU DID LEAK MEMOS.

61
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,094
DID YOU -- IS IT OKAY FOR

62
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:28,964
SOMEBODY AT THE FBI TO LEAK AN

63
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:30,332
INTERNAL DOCUMENT FUN IT'S NOT

64
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:30,999
CLASSIFIED.

65
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:31,767
ISN'T THAT LEAK.

66
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:36,305
>> I DIDN'T LEAK MEMOS.

67
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:38,740
THE SUBSTANCE OF ONE

68
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,909
UNCLASSIFIED MEMO.

69
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,277
JUDGE JEANINE: JIM, YOU ARE NOT

70
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:43,579
A LEAKER.

71
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,147
YOU SAY YOU ASKED THE PRESIDENT

72
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:47,683
IF YOU COULD MEET WITH HIM

73
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:49,685
PRIVATELY TO DISCUSS A DOSSIER

74
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:50,986
BECAUSE IT'S PRIVATE AND YOU

75
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,021
DON'T WANT OTHERS TO HEAR AND

76
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,791
YOU DON'T KNOW CNN TO KNOW.

77
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,559
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU

78
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,828
DO CNN AND THE WORLD HAS IT, AND

79
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:01,897
YOU WANT US TO BELIEVE YOU

80
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:03,899
DIDN'T LEAK THE DOSSIER WHEN YOU

81
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:05,901
SAY IN THE MEMO THAT CLAPPER

82
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:07,135
TOLD TO YOU TELL THE PRESIDENT

83
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,271
ABOUT THE DOSSIER AND TELL HIM

84
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:13,508
IT WON'T BE LEAKED?

85
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:17,112
BRET: DID YOU OR OUR

86
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:18,380
SUBORDINATES LEAK THAT?

87
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,381
>> NO.

88
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:21,049
>> DOWNBRENNAN?

89
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,085
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO LEAKED IT.

90
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:27,122
BRET: DID YOU TRY TO FIND OUT?

91
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,524
>> WHO LEAKED AN UNCLASSIFIED

92
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:31,793
PUBLIC MEMO?

93
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:32,861
NO.

94
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:36,164
JUDGE JEANINE: YOU GIVE A MEMO

95
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:39,034
TO YOUR PAL DAN AND IT'S NOT A

96
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:39,568
LEAK?

97
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:42,871
AND YOU SAY, JIM, IT WASN'T

98
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:45,173
CLASSIFIED, BUT IT WAS MARKED

99
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:50,012
SECRET, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED.

100
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,447
THEN YOU SAY AS THE HEAD OF THE

101
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:55,083
FBI, I CAN DECLASSIFY.

102
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:59,554
YOU TOOK A DOCUMENT THAT WAS

103
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,656
WRITTEN CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH A

104
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,090
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

105
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,959
THE UNITED STATES ADVISING HIM

106
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,227
OF AN INVESTIGATION.

107
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,995
THAT'S A CRIME.

108
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,131
IT'S A CRIME TO CONVEY ANY

109
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:10,132
RECORD OF THE UNITED STATES OR

110
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,667
ANY DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY TO

111
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,735
ANOTHER PERSON.

112
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:16,772
AND YOUR FBI EMPLOYMENT

113
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:21,576
AGREEMENT BARS THE DISCLOSURE OF

114
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,612
FILES ELECTRONIC OR PAPER.

115
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:25,080
REMEMBER WHEN BARACK OBAMA HIRED

116
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,049
YOU YOU SIGNED YOU WILL NOT

117
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,617
REVEAL BY ANY MEANS ANY

118
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:31,586
INFORMATION ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE

119
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:35,123
OF MY OFFICIAL EMPLOYMENT TO ANY

120
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,024
UNAUTHORIZED RECIPIENT.

121
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:38,894
SO NOW MR. SLICK, YOU TELL US

122
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:41,630
YOUR FRIEND DAN RICHMOND IS A

123
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,398
SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE.

124
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:45,500
PRAY TELL, WHO MADE HIM THAT.

125
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,570
WHO DID HIS BACKGROUND CHECK?

126
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,906
LIKE McCABE AND LYNCH YOU JUST

127
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:53,542
THROW HIM UNDER THE BUS.

128
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,211
FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRE AN

129
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:58,180
EMPLOYEE, EVEN HE, SHOULD NOT

130
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,482
ALLOW THE USE OF PRIVATE

131
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:03,418
INFORMATION TO FURTHER HIS OWN

132
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:03,785
INTERESTS.

133
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,654
AND HE HAD TO BE TRAINED AND

134
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:06,555
AGREE TO THIS.

135
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,657
HE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THIS

136
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:10,759
RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING

137
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,359
UNAUTHORIZED DOCUMENTS.

138
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:15,363
YOU KNOW, JIM, YOU SAY IT'S NOT

139
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:17,032
A LEAK AND WE SHOULD BELIEVE IT

140
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,667
BECAUSE YOU SAID IT.

141
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,069
AND YOU ARE SO BRAZEN YOU THINK

142
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,538
YOU CAN CHANGE THE RULES A WE GO

143
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:25,841
ALONG AND WE'LL FOLLOW LIKE

144
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,274
FOOLS.

145
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,144
>> JIM COMEY HAS A DEFINITION OF

146
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:31,880
THE WORD LEAK THAT NO ONE ELSE

147
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,748
HAS.

148
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,649
WHAT HE SAYS IS A LEAK THE REST

149
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,752
OF US CALL A FELONY.

150
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:40,021
LEAK IS DISCLOSING A

151
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:40,756
CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION WHICH

152
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:43,125
IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.

153
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,626
JUDGE JEANINE: JIM, YOU LEAKED

154
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:48,029
THE MEMO BECAUSE YOU WERE AN

155
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,232
ANTI-TRUMPER WHO WANTED TO BEGIN

156
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:51,933
AN INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION

157
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,235
AND YOU WANTED TO EMBARRASS THE

158
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,903
PRESIDENT BY MAKING IT PUBLIC.

159
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,905
AND YOU DIDN'T GET THE REQUIRED

160
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:59,007
PERMISSION FROM THE FBI OR DOJ

161
00:05:59,007 --> 00:05:59,808
TO DO IT.

162
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:02,010
AND JIM YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

163
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,946
SINCE IT WAS PART OF AN

164
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:06,848
INVESTIGATION IT BECOMES A 302

165
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,518
WHICH MEMOS CANNOT BE RELEASED.

166
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:11,086
MY FAVORITE PART IS WHEN YOU

167
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,754
SAID YOU WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE

168
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,689
OF THE NIGHT AND YOU REALIZED

169
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,159
THIS MEMO WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO

170
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,994
GET A SPECIAL COUNSEL ASSIGNED.

171
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:20,896
YOU SAID IT REALLY WAS A

172
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,230
PERSONAL DIARY.

173
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,502
AS IF ANYONE AT THE FBI

174
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:30,438
ROUTINELY SENDS HIS OR HER DIARY

175
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:32,908
AS YOU DID TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF

176
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,910
AND THE FBI'S LEGAL COUNSEL.

177
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,879
YOU SAY THE GUY YOU ADMIRE MOST

178
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:40,282
OF IN GOVERNMENT IS GOOD OLD

179
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:41,183
JAMES CLAPPER.

180
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,618
THE GUY WHO DOESN'T LEAK OR

181
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:45,720
SURVEIL US WITTINGLY.

182
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,389
HE'S ANOTHER LIAR AND A LEAKER

183
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,925
WHO LIKE YOU HATES DONALD TRUMP.

184
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:53,028
THIS BOZO LIKE YOU FLATLY DENIED

185
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:54,462
LEAK THE DOSSIER.

186
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:56,131
HE EVEN RELEASED A STATEMENT TO

187
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:59,034
THE PUBLIC THAT HE ASSURED THE

188
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,902
INCOMING PRESIDENT THAT NEITHER

189
