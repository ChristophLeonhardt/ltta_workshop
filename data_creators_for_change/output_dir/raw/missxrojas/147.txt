00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
Alice was getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tired of sitting</font>

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,410
by the bank and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having nothing to do</font>

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,750
once or twice<font color="#E5E5E5"> share pictures with her</font>

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,519
sister was reading but it had no

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,070
pictures or conversations in it and what

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,660
is the use of a book thought Alice

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,240
without pictures or conversations

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,470
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,660
first published in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1865 and this year</font>

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,670
celebrates its one hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiftieth</font>

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,400
anniversary the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a girl who</font>

follows the rabbit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and falls down a</font>

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,670
rabbit hole has always been one of my

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,800
absolute favorites I think initially

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,390
what dreaming two eyes was her

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,460
stubbornness and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of curious</font>

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,260
note on combination which may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,270
familiar to some of you who know me well

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,520
when I was really young I kind of saw

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,110
her as a sister to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually even think of it like that that</font>

22
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,829
she has a place in my home even now

23
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,390
she's wearing my lush Oxford Street

24
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">opening-day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soaps if she's on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mug he's</font>

25
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,289
also in this set that my<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents found</font>

26
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,969
for me when I was a teenager I'd seen

27
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,070
this set which was a bowl<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ida monk in a</font>

28
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,899
plate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went back for it but it had</font>

gone and six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months to a year later my</font>

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,949
parents found it they tracked it down

31
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,420
through witches or wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was that</font>

32
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,160
I found it and they gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to me as a</font>

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,480
Christmas present it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

34
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,830
kindest things that they ever did for me

35
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,020
and it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the best surprises I've</font>

36
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,580
ever had a thing earlier this year a

37
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of weeks prior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to moving my life</font>

38
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,180
abroad and falling down a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

39
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,070
of rabbit hole as invited to attend an

40
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aston wonderland event at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dorchester</font>

41
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,939
this was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> celebrate the Vivienne</font>

42
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,680
Westwood edition of Alice in Wonderland

43
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
and a book chronicling the story of

44
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,689
Alice<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually titled the story of Alice</font>

45
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,430
walking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly felt a little</font>

46
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,020
out of place even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though there were so</font>

47
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,030
many of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> people back bookpeople</font>

48
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,729
internet people people who like drinking

champagne in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the afternoon</font>

00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,790

<font color="#E5E5E5">leave me with a bit of a neck ache</font>

52
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,549
because I can't help<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking up at</font>

53
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:42,869
things like the chandeliers and

54
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,100
sometimes they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these amazing</font>

55
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,259
paintings on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ceiling or the molding</font>

56
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,939
or the detail just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of time</font>

57
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,229
that someone has spent creating

58
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,460
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people probably</font>

59
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,810
won't even look at that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

60
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,890
intriguing to me especially when

61
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,570
ceilings are somehow designed in some

62
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,430
way to draw the outside in whether

63
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's through glass ceilings and light</font>

64
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,450
coming through or some sort of depiction

65
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,909
of the sky or an enchanted ceiling you

66
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,060
know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes we were treated to</font>

67
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,399
community and oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> my goodness watch the</font>

68
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,169
trees there were tiny cakes in the

69
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,660
shapes of hats and cross and the whole

70
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,310
ritual of opting to you makes you feel

71
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,200
like you're five years old again playing

72
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,670
with your friend Lucy in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the garden</font>

73
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,040
wearing a big fancy dress from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fancy</font>

74
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,290
dress box and copying what everyone else

75
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,819
is doing I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I would</font>

76
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,510
turn 20 and 21 and 22 and 23 I would

77
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,950
stop feeling like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just copying</font>

78
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,810
everyone else that feeling never goes

79
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,819
away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fun to play with</font>

80
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,739
it an opportunities like afternoon tea

81
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,810
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brit I have of course been fasting</font>

82
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,670
tea a few times I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

83
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joey at Kensington Palace and then also</font>

84
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,600
at kew gardens but always for a very

85
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,630
special occasion and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this felt like</font>

86
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,850
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> society in some way a</font>

87
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,280
celebration of a story that has elastic

88
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,140
that has endured and maybe without

89
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanting to sound cheesy a celebration of</font>

90
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,310
all stories the last one of the many

91
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,720
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love about Alice's Adventures</font>

92
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,790
in Wonderland is that she has allowed to

93
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,069
be anyone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone's Alice there's</font>

94
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:03,110
no real sense of ownership no one likes

95
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,420
Alice more than someone else that's not

96
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">how she works there's space for all of</font>

97
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,560
these Alice's however you imagine her

98
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,299
and I wonder whether that's just time

99
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,400
passing a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fifty years</font>

100
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,010
passing just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as there a space for all of</font>

101
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,019
these Hamlet's and all of these Lizzie

102
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,820
Bennett's or whether it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

103
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,400
books and songs and plays draw that kind

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,980
of communal celebration anyway it was a

105
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,540
lovely afternoon a golden afternoon

106
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,859

becoming everyone
