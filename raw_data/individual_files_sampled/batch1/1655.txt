for years president Donald Trump has railed against the u.s. immigration system calling it flawed and in need of reform specifically Trump has argued against chain migration the practice of giving preference to the families of legal immigrants who also hope to come to the United States under the current broken system a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives under our plan we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children this vital reform is necessary not just for our economy but for our security and for the future of America but that effort by the President to end the long-standing US policy known as family reunification appears not to apply to Trump's own family on Thursday Victor and Amalia Knaus parents of First Lady Melania Trump were officially sworn in as US citizens the application the process the interview was no different than anybody else's a pair is from Slovenia where Melania was born and raised until she moved to New York the irony and hypocrisy was not lost on Twitter users who on Thursday expressed outrage over the news pointing to the fact that the president on Twitter just a week ago called for the end of chain migration the program that appears to have granted his in-laws citizenship we must have border security get rid of chained lottery catch and release sanctuary cities go to merit-based immigration he wrote we're glad that the this administration and their family is benefiting from this but it does seem strange the timing of it and the fact that they are willing to benefit while not getting others the rest of us the opportunity to benefit from our family immigration system a spokesperson for the first lady refused to comment to Al Jazeera saying her parents are not part of the administration and deserve privacy the subject of family reunification is a sensitive issue in the United States especially given the Trump administration's recent zero-tolerance enforcement of illegal immigration that has even included separating children from their parents Kimberly Hellcat al Jazeera Washington
