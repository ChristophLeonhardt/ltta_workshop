ARTHEL: THAT IS TOM PAKAR REPORTING. THANKS, TOM. I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA AND I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO MY PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA. I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN. THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING. I CAN NOW WAIT. I CAN NOW CALL HIM. I CAN NOW SAY WELL, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. I TOLD HIM, I GAVE HIM A VERY DIRECT NUMBER. HE CAN NOW CALL ME IF HE HAS ANY DIFFICULTY. I CAN CALL HIM. WE HAVE COMMUNICATION. IT'S A VERY GOOD THING. PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF THEY THOUGHT TRUMP WAS GOING TO GET IN AND START THROWING BOMBS ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE. ERIC: THAT'S PRESIDENT ON THE WHITE HOUSE DRIVEWAY TALKING TO PETER DOOCY AND THE OTHER WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS AFTER HE TALKED TO STEVE DOOCY. HE WAS TALKING BOUTS HIS PLANNED PHONE CALL THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW WITH KIM JONG UN. THIS OF COURSE FOLLOWS THE HISTORIC SUMMIT WITH THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR. SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO SAYS A LOT OF WORK HAS TO BE DONE WITH THE REGIME INCLUDING BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY ITS NUCLEAR FACILITIES. WE HAVE A REASONABLE UNDERSTANDING. IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS PART OF THE EFFORTS THAT WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. WE WILL WORK WITH THE NORTH KOREANS TO COME TO HAVE A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO EXECUTE TOGETHER THE COMMITMENTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM MADE. ERIC: WE HAVE A REASONABLE UNDERSTANDING, NOT A FULL ONE. SECURITY ADVISOR. THIS IS WHERE THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD. ARE WE GOING TO GET CONCRETE MOVES, SPECIFIC STEPS BY THE NORTH KOREANS TO OPEN THE NUCLEAR SITES TO INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS AND START THE PROCESS AS IS PLEDGED OF DENUCLEARIZATION? THAT'S THE $64,000 QUESTION, ERIC. WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR 25 YEARS WITH THE NORTH. WE'VE HAD LOTS OF STATEMENTS IN THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HA THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HE THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HD THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HI THE PAST THAT WE'RE MEDDED IN HN THAT DIRECTION, A VERIFIED, COMPLETE, IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION AND YET WE NEVER GET THERE. THE PROMISE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID THIS WEEK IS THAT HE ESTABLISHED THIS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN. THAT'S SOMETHING DRAMATICALLY NEW. BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T YET ACTUALLY ADVANCED THE BALL ON THIS GOAL THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES OF DENUCLEARIZATION. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT SECRETARY POMPEO HAS GOT TO GET AFTER AND I THINK HE NEEDS TO GET AFTER IT VERY QUICKLY. WE'VE GOT TO SEE SOME RESULTS ON WHAT WE NEED FROM NORTH KOREA SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. ERIC: WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE? WELL, I THINK THE FIRST THING WE'VE GOT TO I WOULD LIKE TO SIMPLY SEE A DECLARATION FROM CHAIRMAN KIM TO HIS PEOPLE IN KOREAN THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WITH THE UNITED STATES, HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES, IN EXCHANGE FOR VIABLE SECURITY AND ECONOMIC GUARANTEES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, NORTH KOREA WILL HAVE NO NUCLEAR PROGRAM WHATSOEVER OR BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM. AFTER THAT, I THINK THEY'VE GOT TO COME CLEAN WITH A FULL DECLARATION OF WHAT THEY'VE GOT BECAUSE AS SECRETARY BOMB POI YOW SAYS WE DON'T POMPEO SAYS, WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'VE GOT 10 NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR 60 NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT'S THE DRAMATIC VARIANCE WE HAVE IN UNDERSTANDING THE FULL SCOPE AND BREADTH OF THIS NUCLEAR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE NORTH HAS BUILT UP. SO WE FIRST HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'VE GOT, THEN WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN THERE WITH OUR INSPECTORS TO VAIR KNEE INSPECTORS TO VERR KNEE INSPECTORS TO VERIFKNEE INSPECTORS TO VERIFYNEE INSPECTORS TO VERIFY IE INSPECTORS TO VERIFY IT ALLER YOU'RE ALU'RE ALL.RE L.RE ERE ERIC: SHOULD THEY PROVIDE A LIST IN THEY'VE GOT NUCLEAR WAR HEADS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES, LABS, BALLISTIC MISSILE MANUFACTURING SITES AND LAUNCH SITES. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY HAND THAT OVER OR THAT IT WILL BE MORE OF THE SAME OF THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR, THEY'LL JUST SPIN AND WAIT AND DELAY, THIS OLD GAME, WATCH THE RED, WATCH THE BLACK, WATCH THE RED, WATCH THE BLACK. IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, THAT'S EXACTLY THE PATH THAT WE'RE HEADED ON. THAT IS THE DANGER OF THE PROCESS WE'RE EMBARKED ON NOW, THAT THE NORTH AS IN THE PAST WILL SIMPLY PLAY FOR TIME, THEY'LL REDUCE THEIR INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION, AND GRADUALLY THEY WILL BEGIN WITH THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE TO ERODE THE INTERNATIONAL SANCTION THAT'S THE CHINESE, THE SOUTH KOREANS, THE RUSSIANS WILL ALL BEGIN TO DROP OFF IN TERMS OF THEIR ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS AND THEN THE NORTH OVER TIME WILL BE FREE AND CLEAR TO CONTINUE TO BUILD UP THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM, ALL THE WHILE GETTING ECONOMIC CONCESSIONS. THE HOPE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IS THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO DELIVER A COMPLETE AND FINAL DECLARATION OF THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR OTHER PARTNERS INTERNATIONALLY CAN FULLY VERIFY WITH INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND. THAT'S THE GOAL THAT WE'VE GOT TO ACHIEVE AND WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS PROCESS AS IT HAS IN THE PAST TO SIMPLY DRAG ON FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS WITHOUT SATISFACTION OF KEY AMERICAN CONCERNS THAT IS STRATEGIC DECISION HAS BEEN MADE BY KIM JONG UN AND COMMUNICATED TO HIS PEOPLE THAT THE JIG IS UP AND NORTH KOREA IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE GUARANTEES FROM THE WEST ERIC: DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GET THAT TOMORROW OR CAN OR NOW IS NOT THE TIME. I THINK IT'S THE JOB OF SECRETARY POMPEO AND THE DIPLOMATS. THE PRESIDENT HAS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TIME IS SHORT AND THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT SECRETARY POMPEO HAS TO GET SATISFACTION ON WHEN HE SITS ACROSS THE TABLE FROM KIM JONG UN. ERIC: IN THE NEXT HOUR, WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS. PROFESSOR WALTER HATCH OF COLBY COLLEGE, THE INSTITUTE OF HUMAN
