62
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:26,424
TROOPS IN GENERAL.

WATCHED ONLINE IT IS UNFORTUNATE

72
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:50,915
PEOPLE CAN'T SEPARATE POLITICS

73
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,284
FROM PATRIOTISM.

74
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,219
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE FOR THE

75
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:02,227

76
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:02,527
ANGRY?

77
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,261
>> MY MESSAGE WOULD PROBABLY BE

78
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:06,197
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

79
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:06,931
ABOUT ANGER, DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE

80
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:07,699
TO BE SO DIVISIVE, DOESN'T HAVE

81
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,166
TO BE LIKE THIS.

82
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:18,576
WE ARE SUCH AN AMAZING COUNTRY

83
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:19,310
AND THE UNIT THAT THE FOURTH OF

84
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,713

85
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:22,413
COUNTRY AND TIME TO UNITE AND

86
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:22,780
CELEBRATE.

87
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,448
I REALLY HATE THE PETTINESS.

88
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:24,182
I WOULD RATHER HONOR THE TROOPS

89
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,184
AND BE PATRIOTIC ABOUT IT.

90
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:37,295
>>

91
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:37,896
AND BE PATRIOTIC ABOUT IT.
>> A LOT OF FINGERS MIGHT

92
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:38,463
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.

93
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:39,164
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PRESIDENT

94
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:39,898
MIGHT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND

95
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:40,565
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

96
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:41,299
BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARED OF THE

97
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:43,468
YOU STRONG ENOUGH TO SAY I DON'T

98
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:43,768
CARE?

99
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,637
>> I HAVE ALWAYS

100
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:46,204
APOLITICAL.

101
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:49,774
I AM CREATIVE AND STILL LEARNING

102
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:50,275
AND STILL GROWING.

103
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:54,212
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH AND I'M OKAY

104
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,848
WITH THAT RIGHT NOW, STILL

105
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,582
READING AND TRAVELING, TRYING TO

106
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:02,787
UNDERSTAND WHERE I AM

107
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:03,188
POLITICALLY.

108
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,523
BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN

109
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:06,257
AND YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL FEAR OF

110
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:10,195
LOSING YOUR JOB IN ANY WAY SO TO

111
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:13,164
ME IT IS A SAD THING WHEN

112
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:18,203
POLITICS BECOMES PART OF YOUR

113
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:18,903
EVERYDAY IDENTITY IN LIFE BUT

114
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:22,207
WHERE I AM NOW IS FOCUSED ON

115
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,910
MUSIC AND JUST LOVING LIFE.

116
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:26,644
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

117
00:04:26,645 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH US, GOD BLESS YOUR FAMILY
