the assault on your second Amendment rights is relentless its well-funded immaculately coordinated and politically loaded and there are dark forces I think at work behind the facade of these crying kids I watched them you know as they marched for our lives much for our lives holding their banners getting selfies and to be fair some of the fatter ones could do with a bit of exercise though yes walk on children walk I'm not all bad but I did wonder listening to them if they were ever going to shut up talk about banging on they said enough is enough yes that's enough shush now children thank you how many times but as a mother of three children age 13 12 and 9 I don't let my children make big decisions when they're upset we wait - we've all calm down and we feel a bit better good parents do not let little people make big decisions especially when they're upset or crying and good politicians do not look to children to make policy particularly not on guns but coordinated by the globalist CNN and the celebrity fools the March should serve as a powerful reminder to all of us of the connected forces at work seeking to erode the freedoms your founding fathers made constitutionally yours I'm a supporter of these rights of yours and I'm proud to say I'm a card-carrying member of the NRA and that my sauce thank you that one's for the NRA and Donna and my son is very pleased actually with his hat and his duffle bag that I've brought home and I have put my NRA car sticker in my car other mothers on the school run have stickers on their cars that say baby on board I like to think that mine has bullets okay so many you know mothers don't really speak to me so much at the school gate does that come as a surprise no not the larger ones um I feel like it's time journalists stop gazing at their navel or the breasts of women who say they've slept with the president and time they got out there and reported on a story to see more of my work and more real reporting join me at Hopkins welcome you
