1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,529
so recently I've had a really tough time

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,950
with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in life and I had</font>

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,920
to sort of be in a mode of ignoring way

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,870
inner feelings because I had two weeks

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,610
of exams and you know I did want to

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,100
screw<font color="#E5E5E5"> them up but when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I took my last</font>

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,830
exam and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished the last essay I was</font>

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,630
going to do for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down my pen</font>

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,050
it then all sank in and my emotions over

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,099
to me and I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really hard to cope</font>

11
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,150
now something song spoke to me today

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,309
about was how I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce art</font>

13
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,530
from when I felt down and in the lowest

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,450
of low and it made me<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,100
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Simon here today which is</font>

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,829
so so sure but it's just hopefully some

17
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,079
words of inspiration of why I get my

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,840
inspiration from and that's from emotion

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,879
I've been doing livejournal as many of

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,260
you know and for those of you that

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,030
haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> my stuff if you click in</font>

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,410
the description<font color="#E5E5E5"> box it should be there</font>

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,449
and i highly recommend everyone should

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,010
do that everyone should write it because

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,510
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something from that that you</font>

26
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,370
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite get from making videos and</font>

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,960
for some people who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,060
confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> to making videos I guess</font>

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,799
writing a journal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first stage of</font>

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,799
expressing yourself to the world and if

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,330
you don't do that you can always make it

32
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,630
private but i plan to every value posts

33
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,080
at least one thing so be sure to check

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,820
out and comment and we can discuss

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,939
things together you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when things are</font>

36
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,280
very bad or when things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going really</font>

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,520
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel something within really</font>

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
strong that makes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,710
express yourself when you're angry<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,780
may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just break something but I</font>

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,420
don't I take a deep breath I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,310
rationalize my thoughts and I produce

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">are many of you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that video</font>

44
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,050
the only thing left to do is cry and at

45
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,010
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video you'll see</font>

46
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,340
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made yesterday in regards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,490
some thoughts I've had lately you're an

48
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,500
emo is something so common on the

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,690
internet and in today's society I think

50
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,420
it was something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that didn't exist there</font>

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,420
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who do express themselves in</font>

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,210
intense ways just for attention but

53
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">unfortunately this stereotype</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has blown</font>

54
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,110
out of portion and now it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

55
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,110
whenever someone expresses themselves

56
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,670
truthfully and realistically that they

57
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,230
get knocked down for it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

58
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,790
people shouldn't be afraid to express

59
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,780
themselves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think sometimes people</font>

60
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,790
get off / even when people do make a

61
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,350
joke<font color="#CCCCCC"> and comment like you've just been</font>

62
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,110
email don't really mean it but whether

63
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,570
you're writing you're making music right

64
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,030
and lyrics anything sending full of

65
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,410
expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman you feel a hell of a</font>

66
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot better and I think that no matter</font>

67
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you are in life if you're having</font>

68
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,350
difficulty times if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you having great</font>

69
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to funnel in</font>

70
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,300
creative ways because it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,950
skill I have which this person earlier

72
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,410
said was the case it's something that we

73
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,350
all have and some of the best lyrics

74
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,330
I've written for my band stuff is when I

75
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,810
was in a time of disarray in questioning

76
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,180
because your mind just races for your

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,050
ideas and he can to rationalizing ideas

78
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,080
and you put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on paper and when you</font>

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,730
read it back you realize you really felt

80
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,340
what that person felt and hopefully at

81
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the in this video you'll feel what I've</font>

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,970
been feeling lately so the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

83
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,680
video is just express yourself and don't

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,590
be afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and if he will put you</font>

85
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,360
down about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they're not people</font>

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should really rely on for</font>

87
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,950
feedback and there will always be people

88
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,660
out there who are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to</font>

89
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,980
you there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are always people willing to</font>

90
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,350
share their ideas with you and I've

91
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,760
learned in life in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and a</font>

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,300
half

93
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,440
