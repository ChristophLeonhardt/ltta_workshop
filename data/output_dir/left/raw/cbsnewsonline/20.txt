1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,633
UP AND PAY ATTENTION.

2
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:04,170
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WILL BE

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,407
THE WORST STORM THAT CENTRAL

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,375
GEORGIA HAS SEEN IN MANY

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:09,943
DECADES.

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:14,681
IT WILL PASS THROUGH AND IMPACT

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,315
NUMEROUS COUNTIES.

8
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,984
HIGH WINDS KILL IMPACT THE

9
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:18,384
VEGETATION THERE.

10
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:20,854
IT WILL BRING DOWN TREES AND

11
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,154
POWER LINES.

12
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,956
THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED, NOT

13
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,124
ONLY FLORIDA BUT GEORGIA NEEDS

14
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,626
TO BE PREPARED TO SEE THE POWER

15
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:31,064
OFF FOR MULTIPLE WEEKS AS THIS

16
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:31,664
SYSTEM PUSHES THROUGH.

17
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,769
ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE ASPECT IS

18
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,436
THE RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE

19
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,372
STORM IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND

20
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,807
NORTH CAROLINA.

21
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:41,508
HOPEFULLY THE RAINFALL WILL BE

22
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,442
REDUCED FOR NORTH CAROLINA AND

23
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,412
SOUTH CAROLINA BUT AS YOU KNOW,

24
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,882
FLORENCE PASSED THROUGH AND SOME

25
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,918
RIVER BASINS HAVE YET TO RECEDE

26
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,319
TO NORMAL RIVER LEVELS.

27
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:53,919
ANY AMOUNT OF RAINFALL THROUGH

28
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,389
NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH

29
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,457
CAROLINA IS NOT WELCOMED.

30
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,659
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WILL BE A

31
00:00:59,659 --> 00:00:59,959
REALITY.

32
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,561
IT WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS AS IT

33
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,929
PUSHES THROUGH AS WELL.

34
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,298
RIGHT NOW FEMA HAS NEARLY 3,000

35
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:05,931
PEOPLE IN THE FIELD.

36
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:08,368
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE

37
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:08,901
FEDERAL PARTNERS THERE.

38
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:12,072
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN

39
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,840
TO PREPOSITION NOT ONLY INCIDENT

40
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,976
MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND DISASTER

41
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,178
MEDICAL TEAMS BUT ALSO ROTARY

42
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,547
AIRCRAFT READY TO GO TO SUPPORT

43
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,147
SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS.

44
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,817
WE HAVE TEAMS STAGED TO BE ABLE

45
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,718
TO MOVE INTO FLORIDA AND INTO

46
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,855
THE AREAS IMPACTED AND ALSO

47
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:29,822
GEORGIA AS WELL.

48
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:32,258
IN REGARDS TO COMMODITIES, THE

49
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,893
STATE OF FLORIDA HAS STRONG

50
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,096
CAPABILITY THAT WE ARE WORKING

51
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,965
HAND IN HAND WITH RIGHT NOW.

52
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,568
THEY HAVE STAGING AND

53
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,601
DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES IN

54
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:42,969
ORLANDO.

55
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,371
WE HAVE TEAMS AT MAXWELL AIR

56
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:52,512
FORCE FACE AS WELL AS ATLANTA

57
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,346
READY TO MOVE IN.

58
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,583
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH

59
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,150
GOVERNOR SCOTT.

60
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,586
HE IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO

61
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,121
POSITION THE STATE TO HELP HIS

62
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,388
CITIZENS.

63
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,791
LAST NIGHT, THEY MADE A VERY

64
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,960
GOOD MOVE BY USING THE WIRELESS

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,860
EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM TO LET

66
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,863
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE STORM IS

67
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,231
GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER

68
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,331
AND YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

69
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,500
THIS IS THE FINAL CALL FOR

70
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,236
ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO GET OUT.

71
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:18,538
TRY TO DO SO.

72
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:22,475
THOSE WHO STICK AROUND TO

73
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,511
EXPERIENCE STORM SURGE DON'T

74
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,414
TYPICALLY LIVE TO TELL ABOUT IT.

75
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:32,018
I WANT TO REITERATE IT IS A

76
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,653
RESPONSE EFFORT OF THE WHOLE

77
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:33,920
COMMUNITY.

78
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,022
IT WILL TAKE NEIGHBORS HELPING

79
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,557
NEIGHBORS AND CITIZENS DONATING

80
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,925
THEIR TIME AND MONEY TO HELP

81
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,427
CITIZENS RECOVER ALL THE WAY UP

82
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,528
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

83
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:48,101
WE ASK YOU ALWAYS TO DOWNLOAD

84
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:54,107
THE FEMA APP, GO TO

THOSE IN NEED.

89
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:06,219
WITH THAT, I WILL PASS IT OVER

90
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,121
TO THOSE FROM NATIONAL

91
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,123
ATMOSPHERIC ASSOCIATION.

92
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,524
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

93
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,760
MICHAEL STRENGTHENED TO CATEGORY

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,830
4 WITH 145 MILE PER HOUR WINDS.

95
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,265
IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO JUST

96
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,333
FOCUS ON THE CORE OF THE STORM.

97
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,437
THIS HAS A 200 MILE WIND SPREAD

98
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,237
FROM THE STORM CENTER.

99
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:26,939
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS WILL

100
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,543
BE POURING OUT INTO ALABAMA AND

101
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,710
PORTIONS OF FLORIDA.

102
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,681
THIS WILL BE A DEVASTATING

103
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:34,881
STORM.

104
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,650
WE ARE LOOKING AT FLOODING AT 9

105
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,185
TO 14 FEET.

106
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,219
THAT WILL IMPACT THE AREAS.

107
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,487
FORTUNATELY HIGH TIDE WILL BE

108
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,423
LATE TONIGHT BUT WATER AT THAT

109
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:49,962
LEVEL WILL PUSH A LOT OF

110
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,199
INENDATION INTO THE --

111
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,269
INUNDATION INTO THE COASTAL

112
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:56,469
AREAS.

113
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,405
IT IS LIKELY TO BE WIDESPREAD

114
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,008
POWER OUTAGES IN GEORGIA AND THE

115
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,143
THREAT FOR TORNADOES ALONG THE

116
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:04,943
TRACK OF MICHAEL.

117
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,212
GETTING INTO THURSDAY AND

118
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,448
FRIDAY, THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT

119
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,216
WILL PUSH INTO THE CAROLINAS.

120
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,552
WE ARE LOOKING AT NINE RIVERS

121
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,187
SPECIFICALLY IMPACTED FROM

122
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,923
FLORENCE THAT ARE LIKELY TO SEE

123
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,255
MORE FLOODING.

124
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,190
FORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT EXPECTED

125
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,760
TO STALL AND IT WILL MOVE

126
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,392
QUICKLY OFF SHORE.

127
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:22,862
SO THE FLOODING THAT OCCURS

128
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,565
SHOULD BE SHORT LIVED AND

129
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,035
MICHAEL WILL PULL OUT TO SEA BY

130
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:29,368
THIS WEEKEND.

131
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:30,102

RETURNING TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR

381
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,793
IS NOT A STEP DOWN BUT A STEP

382
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:29,028
UP.

383
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,463
SHE SAYS SHE WILL NOT RUN FOR

384
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,531

392
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,080
THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED SOMEONE

393
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,117

394
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,651
WOULD BE INCREDIBLE .

395
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,487
BUT HIS DAUGHTER QUICKLY TWEETED

396
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,356
THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HER.
