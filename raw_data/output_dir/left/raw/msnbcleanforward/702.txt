00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,771
YESTERDAY WE HAD A TEXAS POLL THAT HAD BETO DOWN NINE POINTS.

46
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,106
THAT HAD BETO DOWN NINE POINTS. I’M STILL SKEPTICAL THAT TEXAS

47
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,276
I’M STILL SKEPTICAL THAT TEXAS IS READY TO TURN BLUE QUITE YET.

48
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,544
IS READY TO TURN BLUE QUITE YET. BUT, OBVIOUSLY, HE’S IN THE

49
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:50,878
BUT, OBVIOUSLY, HE’S IN THE GAME.

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,582
GAME. YOU LOOK AT TEXAS, ARIZONA,

51
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,584
YOU LOOK AT TEXAS, ARIZONA, INDIANA, FLORIDA, MISSOURI -- I

52
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:57,852
INDIANA, FLORIDA, MISSOURI -- I COULD NAME FOUR OR FIVE OTHER

53
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:58,953
COULD NAME FOUR OR FIVE OTHER STATES -- THE SENATE COULD BREAK

54
00:01:58,954 --> 00:01:59,453
STATES -- THE SENATE COULD BREAK EITHER WAY.

55
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,388
EITHER WAY. IT ACTUALLY COULD BE A BIG NIGHT

56
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,990
IT ACTUALLY COULD BE A BIG NIGHT FOR REPUBLICANS OR IT COULD BE

57
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,091
FOR REPUBLICANS OR IT COULD BE AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER FOR MITCH

58
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:08,596
AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER FOR MITCH McCONNELL AND A HUGE NIGHT FOR

59
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:08,996
McCONNELL AND A HUGE NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS.

60
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:10,231
DEMOCRATS. >> WELL, AND THERE ARE STILL SO

61
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,701
>> WELL, AND THERE ARE STILL SO MANY POTENTIAL LOOMING DISASTERS

62
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:15,436
MANY POTENTIAL LOOMING DISASTERS FOR REPUBLICANS, YOU KNOW.

63
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:16,604
FOR REPUBLICANS, YOU KNOW. HOW DOES THIS SENATE

64
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,473
HOW DOES THIS SENATE CONFIRMATION BATTLE END UP?

65
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,974
CONFIRMATION BATTLE END UP? ARE THERE ANY NEW REVELATIONS

66
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,410
ARE THERE ANY NEW REVELATIONS FROM THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION?

67
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,979
FROM THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION? THOSE REALLY TIGHT RACES THAT

68
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,280
THOSE REALLY TIGHT RACES THAT ARE STILL POLLING WITHIN THE

69
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,416
ARE STILL POLLING WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR ARE PRETTY MUCH

70
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,217
MARGIN OF ERROR ARE PRETTY MUCH UP IN THE AIR.

71
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,219
UP IN THE AIR. AND WITH TEXAS, I HAD BEEN

72
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,687
AND WITH TEXAS, I HAD BEEN SURPRISED BY HOW CLOSE THE RACE

73
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:34,222
SURPRISED BY HOW CLOSE THE RACE SEEMS TO BE GETTING.

74
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:36,691
SEEMS TO BE GETTING. I STILL THINK, LIKE YOU, THAT

75
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,426
I STILL THINK, LIKE YOU, THAT IT’S IMPOSSIBLE WHERE THERE ARE

76
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,727
IT’S IMPOSSIBLE WHERE THERE ARE JUST MORE REPUBLICAN VOTERS.

77
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:41,829
JUST MORE REPUBLICAN VOTERS. I THINK IN THE PRIMARY,

78
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,066
I THINK IN THE PRIMARY, REPUBLICANS OUTNUMBERED DEMS BY

79
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,235
REPUBLICANS OUTNUMBERED DEMS BY 1.5 MILLION TO 1 MILLION VOTERS.

80
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:48,336
1.5 MILLION TO 1 MILLION VOTERS. SO, I JUST THINK THAT THE

81
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:50,071
SO, I JUST THINK THAT THE NUMBERS GAME IS GOING TO BE VERY

82
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,841
NUMBERS GAME IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR DEMOCRATS TO

83
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:53,975
DIFFICULT FOR DEMOCRATS TO OVERCOME IN THAT SENATE RACE.

84
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,944
OVERCOME IN THAT SENATE RACE. BUT YOU LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, THE

85
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:57,913
BUT YOU LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, THE RACE THAT’S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,

86
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:59,948
RACE THAT’S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, AND BETO REALLY IS GIVING TED

87
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,549
AND BETO REALLY IS GIVING TED CRUZ A RUN FOR HIS MONEY.

88
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:03,351
CRUZ A RUN FOR HIS MONEY. AND ONE OF THE SMARTEST GOP

89
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:04,752
AND ONE OF THE SMARTEST GOP OPERATIVES IN TEXAS TOLD ME

90
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:07,823
OPERATIVES IN TEXAS TOLD ME ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO THAT CRUZ

91
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,557
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO THAT CRUZ WILL LIKELY STILL WIN BUT THAT

92
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:12,860
WILL LIKELY STILL WIN BUT THAT IT WOULD BE A TOUGH RACE, THAT

93
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:13,662
IT WOULD BE A TOUGH RACE, THAT BETO O’ROURKE WAS COMPARABLE TO

94
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:16,131
BETO O’ROURKE WAS COMPARABLE TO AN RFK IN TERMS OF HIS POLITICAL

95
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:17,065
AN RFK IN TERMS OF HIS POLITICAL TALENT, AND WE’RE REALLY SEEING

96
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,200
TALENT, AND WE’RE REALLY SEEING THAT PLAY OUT IN THIS RACE.

97
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:21,970
THAT PLAY OUT IN THIS RACE. >> SO, KASIE HUNT, YOU TALKED TO

98
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,371
>> SO, KASIE HUNT, YOU TALKED TO SENATORS, CONGRESSMEN, WOMEN,

99
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:23,838
SENATORS, CONGRESSMEN, WOMEN, EVERY DAY.

100
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,674
EVERY DAY. YOU TALK TO THEIR STAFFERS AND

101
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:26,575
YOU TALK TO THEIR STAFFERS AND INSIDERS ON CAPITOL HILL.

102
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:28,777
INSIDERS ON CAPITOL HILL. WHAT’S THE GENUINE LEVEL OF

103
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:29,444
WHAT’S THE GENUINE LEVEL OF CONCERN ABOUT THE SENATE?

104
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:30,679
CONCERN ABOUT THE SENATE? WE KNOW REPUBLICANS ARE WORRIED

105
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,780
WE KNOW REPUBLICANS ARE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THE HOUSE.

106
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,981
ABOUT LOSING THE HOUSE. WHAT ABOUT THE SENATE?

107
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:34,683
WHAT ABOUT THE SENATE? DO THEY REALLY THINK THAT COULD

108
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:35,017
DO THEY REALLY THINK THAT COULD FLIP?

109
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,185
FLIP? >> I THINK THAT THERE IS

110
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,587
>> I THINK THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY A SENSE THAT WHAT HAD

111
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,623
DEFINITELY A SENSE THAT WHAT HAD BEEN A RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE

112
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:43,291
BEEN A RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE PLACE TO BE, BECAUSE THE MATH.

113
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,293
PLACE TO BE, BECAUSE THE MATH. THE MATH IS REALLY SO DRAWN IN

114
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:45,827
THE MATH IS REALLY SO DRAWN IN REPUBLICANS’ FAVOR.

115
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:46,995
REPUBLICANS’ FAVOR. I MEAN, THIS IS -- IF YOU THINK

116
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,430
I MEAN, THIS IS -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, THERE’S THREE

117
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:49,398
ABOUT THIS, THERE’S THREE CLASSES OF ELECTIONS.

118
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,033
CLASSES OF ELECTIONS. THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE BEST

119
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,567
THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE BEST AND HAS THEIR BEST SET OF

120
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,701
AND HAS THEIR BEST SET OF CHANCES, BUT THEY’VE GOTTEN A

121
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:54,603
CHANCES, BUT THEY’VE GOTTEN A LOT MORE NERVOUS IN THE LAST

122
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:55,437
LOT MORE NERVOUS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

123
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:56,771
COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND QUITE FRANKLY, DEMOCRATS

124
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,007
AND QUITE FRANKLY, DEMOCRATS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT MORE EXCITED.

125
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,775
HAVE GOTTEN A LOT MORE EXCITED. I BUMPED INTO A PAIR OF

126
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,010
I BUMPED INTO A PAIR OF DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO ARE

127
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,311
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO ARE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, CHATTING,

128
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:05,113
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, CHATTING, YOU KNOW, BETWEEN THEMSELVES

129
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,449
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN THEMSELVES ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE ONE

130
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,884
ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE ONE MORNING AFTER A SERIES OF POLLS

131
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:09,818
MORNING AFTER A SERIES OF POLLS CAME OUT.

132
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,420
CAME OUT. I DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IF

133
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,422
I DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU’RE KIND OF TRACKING -- IF

134
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:14,590
YOU’RE KIND OF TRACKING -- IF YOU HAVE A MOOD POLL THAT

135
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,024
YOU HAVE A MOOD POLL THAT DOESN’T NECESSARILY CALL VOTERS

136
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,659
DOESN’T NECESSARILY CALL VOTERS BUT THAT GETS A READ ON KIND OF

137
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:18,994
BUT THAT GETS A READ ON KIND OF WHERE EACH SIDE IS, THEY

138
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,229
WHERE EACH SIDE IS, THEY DEFINITELY FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

139
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:21,963
DEFINITELY FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE THING

140
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:24,032
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE THING ABOUT TEXAS, REGARDLESS OF

141
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:26,135
ABOUT TEXAS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BETO O’ROURKE ULTIMATELY

142
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:29,238
WHETHER BETO O’ROURKE ULTIMATELY DOES BEAT TED CRUZ, IS THAT,

143
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,439
DOES BEAT TED CRUZ, IS THAT, DON’T UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH A

144
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:31,307
DON’T UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH A SUCK OF RESOURCES THAT IS.

145
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,342
SUCK OF RESOURCES THAT IS. I MEAN, IT’S A HUGE, INCREDIBLY

146
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:33,842
I MEAN, IT’S A HUGE, INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE STATE.

147
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,177
EXPENSIVE STATE. YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS HAD BEEN

148
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,845
YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS HAD BEEN WORRIED ALL THE WAY ALONG ABOUT

149
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,580
WORRIED ALL THE WAY ALONG ABOUT FLORIDA, BECAUSE FRANKLY, YOU

150
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,416
FLORIDA, BECAUSE FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, BILL NELSON, THE CANDIDATE

151
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,051
KNOW, BILL NELSON, THE CANDIDATE AND HIS CAMPAIGN HAS JUST NOT

152
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:43,452
AND HIS CAMPAIGN HAS JUST NOT STACKED UP TO WHAT THEY WERE

153
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,520
STACKED UP TO WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR FROM HIM, SO THEY’VE

154
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,855
LOOKING FOR FROM HIM, SO THEY’VE HAD TO PROP HIM UP WITH MILLIONS

155
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,290
HAD TO PROP HIM UP WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

156
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:48,724
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAVE A

157
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,259
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAVE A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THAT IN TEXAS.

158
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,861
COUNTERWEIGHT TO THAT IN TEXAS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE NATIONAL

159
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:52,929
AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE’S THINKING ABOUT HOW

160
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:54,563
COMMITTEE’S THINKING ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH THIS OVERALL, THAT’S

161
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:55,831
TO APPROACH THIS OVERALL, THAT’S ACTUALLY A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

162
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:56,165
ACTUALLY A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FACTOR.

163
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,700
FACTOR. >> AND HOW FASCINATING, TWO OF

164
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,369
>> AND HOW FASCINATING, TWO OF THE LARGEST, MOST IMPORTANT

165
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:01,470
THE LARGEST, MOST IMPORTANT STATES, CERTAINLY FOR

166
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,605
STATES, CERTAINLY FOR REPUBLICANS, TEXAS AND FLORIDA

167
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,874
REPUBLICANS, TEXAS AND FLORIDA NOW BOTH OF THEM TOSS-UPS.

168
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,643
NOW BOTH OF THEM TOSS-UPS. AND AGAIN, THE GOVERNORS’ RACE

169
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:09,245
AND AGAIN, THE GOVERNORS’ RACE LOOKING RIGHT NOW LIKE IT’S

170
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:10,880
LOOKING RIGHT NOW LIKE IT’S BREAKING DECIDEDLY DEMOCRATIC.

171
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:11,914
BREAKING DECIDEDLY DEMOCRATIC. THAT COULD HAVE HUGE

172
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:12,982
THAT COULD HAVE HUGE IMPLICATIONS OVER THE NEXT

173
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:14,550
IMPLICATIONS OVER THE NEXT DECADE, BECAUSE REDISTRICTING

174
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:19,689
DECADE, BECAUSE REDISTRICTING WILL BE DONE BY WHATEVER JUDGE,

175
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,757
WILL BE DONE BY WHATEVER JUDGE, WHATEVER GOVERNOR IS ELECTED IN

176
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,692
WHATEVER GOVERNOR IS ELECTED IN 2018.

177
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:26,930
2018. SO, JON, WAVE ELECTIONS.

178
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,698
SO, JON, WAVE ELECTIONS. WHEN YOU HAVE EIGHT, TEN RACES

179
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,166
WHEN YOU HAVE EIGHT, TEN RACES LIKE THIS THAT ARE WITHIN THE

180
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,268
LIKE THIS THAT ARE WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR, A WAVE

181
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:33,669
MARGIN OF ERROR, A WAVE ELECTION, IT’S CALLED THAT

182
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,572
ELECTION, IT’S CALLED THAT BECAUSE IT DOES USUALLY SWEEP

183
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:37,807
BECAUSE IT DOES USUALLY SWEEP DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS OVER

184
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,109
DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS OVER THE FINISH LINE AND ONE OR TWO

185
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,412
THE FINISH LINE AND ONE OR TWO DON’T WIN, USUALLY YOU GET A

186
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,048
DON’T WIN, USUALLY YOU GET A WHOLE GANG OF THEM GETTING IN

187
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:45,381
WHOLE GANG OF THEM GETTING IN THERE.

188
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:50,286
THERE. BUT YOU LOOK AT WAVE YEARS,

189
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:54,123
BUT YOU LOOK AT WAVE YEARS, 1964, 1974, 1980, 1994.

190
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:56,592
1964, 1974, 1980, 1994. BUT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS,

191
00:05:56,627 --> 00:06:00,396
BUT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, TEN, TWELVE YEARS, THEY’VE COME

192
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:03,833
TEN, TWELVE YEARS, THEY’VE COME IN 2006, 2008 WITH BARACK OBAMA,

193
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:08,204
IN 2006, 2008 WITH BARACK OBAMA, 2010 WITH THE TEA PARTIERS.

194
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:10,340
2010 WITH THE TEA PARTIERS. THEY SEEM TO BE COMING WITH MORE

195
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,142
THEY SEEM TO BE COMING WITH MORE REGULARITY, AND ALL THE SIGNS,

196
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:15,579
REGULARITY, AND ALL THE SIGNS, AT LEAST TO ME, POINT TO A BIG

197
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:16,846
AT LEAST TO ME, POINT TO A BIG DEMOCRATIC WAVE THIS YEAR.

198
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,214
DEMOCRATIC WAVE THIS YEAR. IF THAT’S THE CASE, THERE ARE A

199
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:20,150
IF THAT’S THE CASE, THERE ARE A LOT OF THESE RACES WHERE

200
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,118
LOT OF THESE RACES WHERE REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE NERVOUS,

201
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:22,352
REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE NERVOUS, UNLESS THE DYNAMICS REALLY

202
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,086
UNLESS THE DYNAMICS REALLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX

203
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,623
CHANGE IN THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

204
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:28,525
WEEKS. >> THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF

205
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:33,230
>> THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF POLITICS HAS BECOME SO FLUID.

206
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,365
POLITICS HAS BECOME SO FLUID. THE TWO YEARS I THINK ABOUT ARE

207
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:36,366
THE TWO YEARS I THINK ABOUT ARE 1966, RIGHT?

208
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,801
1966, RIGHT? SO, YOU HAVE 1964 WITH JOHNSON,

209
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,970
SO, YOU HAVE 1964 WITH JOHNSON, WITH THAT MASSIVE LANDSLIDE,

210
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:43,273
WITH THAT MASSIVE LANDSLIDE, INCREDIBLE NUMBERS.

211
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:45,275
INCREDIBLE NUMBERS. 1966, BIG REPUBLICAN YEAR,

212
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,176
1966, BIG REPUBLICAN YEAR, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF A

213
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,811
INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF A FELLOW OUT IN CALIFORNIA NAMED

214
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:48,178
FELLOW OUT IN CALIFORNIA NAMED REAGAN.

215
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:52,883
REAGAN. AND IT WAS THE ’66 RACE THAT

216
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,685
AND IT WAS THE ’66 RACE THAT BEGAN TO CONVINCE RICHARD NIXON

217
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,286
BEGAN TO CONVINCE RICHARD NIXON THAT HE COULD COME BACK IN ’68.

218
00:06:56,321 --> 00:07:00,023
THAT HE COULD COME BACK IN ’68. AND THEN, OF COURSE, ’94, WHICH

219
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:01,091
AND THEN, OF COURSE, ’94, WHICH ENDED -- WE FORGET THIS BECAUSE

220
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,460
ENDED -- WE FORGET THIS BECAUSE IT’S BEEN BOUNCING BACK AND

221
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:06,997
IT’S BEEN BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH -- 40 YEARS, 40 YEARS OF

222
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:09,299
FORTH -- 40 YEARS, 40 YEARS OF DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE HOUSE

223
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,234
DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM ’54 TO

224
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:11,502
OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM ’54 TO ’94.

225
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:14,071
’94. AND THAT WAS A REACTION,

226
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:17,674
AND THAT WAS A REACTION, OBVIOUSLY, TO THE EARLY CLINTON

227
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:17,974
OBVIOUSLY, TO THE EARLY CLINTON YEARS.

228
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:19,710
YEARS. THERE’S SOMETHING IN THE

229
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,112
THERE’S SOMETHING IN THE AMERICAN SPIRIT, AND IT’S

230
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:22,980
AMERICAN SPIRIT, AND IT’S MATHEMATICAL.

231
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:25,215
MATHEMATICAL. IT’S NOT A GOOEY POINT.

232
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:27,384
IT’S NOT A GOOEY POINT. THAT SHIFTS FROM GUARDRAIL TO

233
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:27,718
THAT SHIFTS FROM GUARDRAIL TO GUARDRAIL.

234
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:28,819
GUARDRAIL. WE’VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

235
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,754
WE’VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, IT’S

236
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:32,990
IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, IT’S HARD TO IMAGINE A SET OF MORE

237
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,425
HARD TO IMAGINE A SET OF MORE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN GEORGE

238
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,827
DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN GEORGE H.W. BUSH TO BILL CLINTON, BILL

239
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,462
H.W. BUSH TO BILL CLINTON, BILL CLINTON TO GEORGE W. BUSH.

240
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:40,530
CLINTON TO GEORGE W. BUSH. I ENTER THOUGHT WE’D SEE A

241
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,032
I ENTER THOUGHT WE’D SEE A STARKER CONTRAST THAN GEORGE W.

242
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,968
STARKER CONTRAST THAN GEORGE W. BUSH TO BARACK OBAMA UNTIL

243
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:45,903
BUSH TO BARACK OBAMA UNTIL BARACK OBAMA TO DONALD TRUMP,

244
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:48,806
BARACK OBAMA TO DONALD TRUMP, WHICH MEANS WE MAY GET ARISTOTLE

245
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:49,240
WHICH MEANS WE MAY GET ARISTOTLE NEXT TIME.

246
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:49,907
NEXT TIME. THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THIS

247
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,742
THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THIS WORKS.

248
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,010
WORKS. >> YOU’RE GOING TO BRING HIM

249
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,344
>> YOU’RE GOING TO BRING HIM BACK FROM THE DEAD, JON?

250
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:55,746
BACK FROM THE DEAD, JON? >> YOU KNOW, HE’S PAGAN, BUT

251
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:59,750
>> YOU KNOW, HE’S PAGAN, BUT WE’LL WORK ON IT.

252
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:02,987
WE’LL WORK ON IT. BUT I THINK THIS IS -- I THINK

253
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:03,554
BUT I THINK THIS IS -- I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING.

254
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:06,557
THERE’S SOMETHING. AND SO, WE’RE SO POLARIZED, AND

255
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,159
AND SO, WE’RE SO POLARIZED, AND YET, THERE’S A KIND OF FLUIDITY

256
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,428
YET, THERE’S A KIND OF FLUIDITY IN THE MIDDLE, I THINK.

257
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,564
IN THE MIDDLE, I THINK. AND SO, IT WOULDN’T SURPRISE ME

258
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,167
AND SO, IT WOULDN’T SURPRISE ME AT ALL TO SEE THE DEMOCRATS WIN

259
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:16,968
AT ALL TO SEE THE DEMOCRATS WIN THE SENATE.

260
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:19,437
THE SENATE. I THINK PHIL BRETTSON IS DOING

261
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:22,640
I THINK PHIL BRETTSON IS DOING INCREDIBLY WELL IN TENNESSEE,

262
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,975
INCREDIBLY WELL IN TENNESSEE, AND A HUGE HOUSE NUMBER AS A

263
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,476
AND A HUGE HOUSE NUMBER AS A REACTION TO WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

264
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:27,378
REACTION TO WHAT JUST HAPPENED. THEN WE’LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TWO

265
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,179
THEN WE’LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TWO YEARS AFTER THAT.

266
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,514
YEARS AFTER THAT. >>> ALL RIGHT, STILL AHEAD, IN

267
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:30,681
>>> ALL RIGHT, STILL AHEAD, IN 2016, E-MAILS WERE HACKED,

268
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,583
2016, E-MAILS WERE HACKED, SOCIAL MEDIA WAS INUNDATED WITH

269
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,050
SOCIAL MEDIA WAS INUNDATED WITH FAKE NEWS, AND RUSSIANS TRIED TO

270

FAKE NEWS, AND RUSSIANS TRIED TO REACH OUT TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN

271
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:36,354
REACH OUT TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATES.

SUBVERT AN ELECTION AND WHAT IT ALL MEANS.
