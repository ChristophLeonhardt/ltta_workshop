>> I'M EXEMPT        AGAINST ITT

39
00:00:57,915 --> 00:00:59,217
WHEN I WROTE IT IN THE EARLY

40
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:02,954
'90s WE DID NOT INCLUDE

41
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:03,588
VIOLENT FELONIES AND THEY

42
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:06,123
AMENDED IT TO INCLUDE COVERING

43
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:06,624
VIOLENT FELONIES.

44
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:09,160
AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE IS A

45
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,861
THREE-PRONGED TEST THAT OF

46
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,562
VIOLENT FELON WOULD HAVE TO GO

47
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:12,230
THROUGH IN ORDER FOR THEM TO

48
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,832
CALL ICE.

49
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:16,901
SO I SAID TO THE SUPERVISOR WHO

50
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,403
DID IT, I'M NOT GOING TO AGREE

51
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:21,205
TO THAT BECAUSE THEY DID COME TO

52
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:22,139
ME AS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR AND

53
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,309
ASK ME DO I AGREE WITH ADDING

54
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:27,011
VIOLENT FELONS AND I SAID OF

55
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,813
COURSE I DON'T AGREE WITH ADDING

56
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:29,881
VIOLENT FELONS.

57
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,381
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

58
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:34,352
THE CONCEPT IS TO PROTECT

59
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:35,620
FAMILIES, NEVER TO PROTECT

60
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,087
VIOLENT FELONS.

61
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:36,854
IT SO WHEN I DID THIS ORDINANCE

62
00:01:36,854 --> 00:01:40,658
A MONTH AGO, THERE WAS QUITE A

63
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:41,125
BIT OF HYSTERIA.

64
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,426
ALL OF THE SUPERVISORS AND THE

65
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:45,229
MAYOR OF THE CITY AND THE CITY

66
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,433
ATTORNEY AND THE D.A. GOT ON THE

00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,335
ICONIC STEPS OF SAN FRANCISCO

68
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:52,970
CITY HALL AND CALLED ME ALL

69
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,472
SORTS OF NAMES AND SAID THIS WAS

70
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:56,607
OUTRAGEOUS THAT I WOULD BE

71
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:57,775
ATTACKING THE SANCTUARY LAW.

72
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:59,010
I'M NOT ATTACKING THE SANCTUARY

73
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,011
LAW.

74
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:01,212
I'M ATTACKING VIOLENT FELONS.

75
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,847
THEY SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED

76
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:04,782
UNDER THE SANCTUARY LAW OR ANY

77
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:05,483
OTHER LAW IN SAN FRANCISCO

78
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,985
BECAUSE AS YOU SAID, WE

79
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,586
BECOME -- LET'S GO TO

80
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:10,354
SAN FRANCISCO, WE WILL BE SAFE.

81
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:12,790
THE OTHER NIGHT ON THE NEWS, IT

82
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,758
WAS VERY INTERESTING, TUCKER.

83
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,792
THE OTHER NIGHT ON THE NEWS ONE

84
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,460
OF THE PEOPLE MENTIONED THAT

85
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,764
THERE HADN'T BEEN ANYBODY IN THE

86
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,900
COUNTY JAILS IN OVER A YEAR AND

87
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,602
A HALF AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE

88
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,202
STANDARD IS TOO HIGH.

89
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,571
>> Tucker: THAT'S NUTS.

90
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:28,806
JUST TELL US FOR THOSE OF US

91
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:30,775
THAT DON'T LIVE IN

92
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,343
SAN FRANCISCO, WHAT'S THE

93
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:34,345
THINKING BEHIND WANTING MORE

94
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:36,380
VIOLENT FELONS WHO ARE ILLEGAL

95
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,148
ALIENS IN YOUR CITY?

96
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:38,683
HOW DOES THAT IMPROVE THE LIFE

97
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:41,419
OF THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO?

98
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,586
>> TUCKER, I HAVE ASKED EVERY

99
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:43,921
SINGLE ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO CAME

100
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:45,156
OUT AGAINST ME IN THE MIDDLE OF

101
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,857
THIS ADMINISTRATION, BY THE WAY,

102
00:02:46,857 --> 00:02:47,792
WHICH WAS PRETTY DRAMATIC.

103
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,759
I'VE ASKED THEM WHY DO YOU WANT

104
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,196
TO PROTECT VIOLENT FELONS, AND

105
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:53,164
THE ANSWER TO THAT, IF THE

106
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,899
ANSWER AT ALL, MOST OF THEM

107
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,033
DON'T ANSWER, BUT THE ANSWER

108
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,035
THAT SOME OF THEM GAVE ME WAS

109
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:59,236
THAT I'M CHIPPING AWAY AT THE

110
00:02:59,236 --> 00:02:59,670
SANCTUARY LAW.

111
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,406
I SAID I'M NOT CHIPPING AWAY AT

112
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:03,407
THE SANCTUARY LAW.

113
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:04,508
I WROTE THE LAW ORIGINALLY.

114
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:06,877
IT WAS TO PROTECT FAMILIES.

115
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,879
I WE KNOW IF I WAS CHIPPING AWAY

116
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,280
AT THE LAW.

117
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,983
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU

118
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,051
SOMETHING, I'M RUNNING FOR MAYOR

119
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,386
AND I MEET HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

120
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:15,987
EVERY DAY.

121
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,989
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THE

122
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,856
CITIZENS OF SAN FRANCISCO SAY TO

123
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:20,424
ME IS THANK GOD YOU ARE DOING

124
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:22,994
SOMETHING ABOUT DANGEROUS

125
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,327
FELONS.

126
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:24,462
IT'S THE FIRST THING THEY SAY.

127
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:26,797
>> Tucker: I DON'T THINK I'M

128
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:29,166
IN DANGER OF SWAYING A SINGLE

129
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:29,900
VOTE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

130
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,969
IN SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I SAY

131
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,939
GOD BLESS YOU FOR DOING THIS AND

132
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,609
B, I REALLY HOPE YOU PREVAIL.

133
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,912
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN

134
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:42,246
AMERICA.

135
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:42,813
>> I'M VERY EXCITED.

136
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:43,581
WITH THAT TITLE AND SUMMARY FROM

137
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:46,183
THE CITY ATTORNEY.

138
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,284
INTERESTING THING ABOUT GETTING

139
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,019
TITLE IN SUMMARY FROM THE CITY

140
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,721
ATTORNEY IS THAT HE WAS STANDING

141
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,357
ON THE STEPS CONDEMNING ME.

142
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,792
A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT OF

143
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:55,159
INTEREST.

144
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,961
>> Tucker: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

145
00:03:56,961 --> 00:00:00,000
IF YOU GET THIS, I HOPE YOU'LL
