the US national security adviser and his Russian counterpart have held more than five hours of talks in Geneva but john bolton didn't give much away to reporters at a short news briefing afterwards I think we made a lot of progress we identified certain areas where lines of communication could be restored there were some where the areas of disagreement remained we didn't see much utility and in resuming discussion there are going to be some things where we're going to consider inside the United States government consider more fully what our position is and then decide to proceed from there well this meeting of national security advisors was while the groundwork was laid for it when the presidents met in Helsinki last month today they covered the whole range of pretty much what had been touched upon in Helsinki they talked about nuclear non-proliferation they talked about cyberattacks they talked about the situation in Syria in Afghanistan and in Ukraine as well this meeting of course comes when relations between Moscow and Washington are a particularly low air with sanctions from the United States against Russia looming over the poisoning of Sergius crippled in the United Kingdom earlier this year Russia denies any rare role in the attempt on mr. Scalli files life when it came to the Iranian sanctions in the Iran nuclear deal John Bolton unequivocal he was saying that the will be sanctions put in place against Iran and those doing business with Iran and that the sanctions are coming in November he's aired it's the Russian side didn't ask for any exemptions during the meeting today and that the US side aren't expecting to give many exemptions at all they also talked about Iranian troops in Syria mr. Bolton saying that he wanted to see both as he put it regular and irregular Iranian troops removed from Syria pulled back from Syria the Russian side going into this had already said that they were in support of this but that this wasn't something that was going to be happening immediately as with any of the these meetings when it comes to senior figures within the the Trump White House and within the Trump the Trump administration there were questions about Russian meddling and this squirt this time well it was no different whether you ever concerned that your own president is a security risk of course not I mean that's a silly question and I just spoke to him literally a few minutes ago and we we have performed here in exactly the way I think the two leaders would have expected us to and you know honestly have a little faith in the American people who elected him president thank you very much we waited hours and hours for mr. Bolton to come then and speak to us it was very short not so sweet at the end there following that question from my colleague from the BBC it's worth noting that after that one of mr. Bolton's staff came along pulled her to one site and told her that well her question was ridiculous and that they wouldn't be working with their organization in the future that shocked quite a few of the geneva diplomatic press corps here but this meeting between the two national security advisors it it didn't result in any major breakthroughs we weren't really expecting that but where they agreed they still agree and where there's disagreement well they're certainly still discord between Washington and Moscow as it stands at the moment we get live reaction now from former US congressman dr. Ron Paul welcome to the program now john bolton there was pretty tight-lipped after the meeting but what were you able to read into about how the meeting went with what he did put forward well i i thought it was terrible all he did was threaten people and assume that we control the world and we control everything one thing that caught my my attention was getting rid of get getting Iran to take out their troops now that's a reasonable request as long as the request is any foreign nation that has troops in Syria that have been uninvited should all leave together that's what the problem is this picking and choosing that we decide and say yes he can have true in here not the other ones but no I think the threats and intimidation and the sanctions it's just a penalty on the people they never hurt the government they just give incentives to the government so I think I think this whole notion that sanctions are a weapon and now we as a country Americans oh yeah you know threatening even more severe sanctions and I think that's the wrong way to go I think sanctions are an early rehearsal for war continuing with what you mentioned about Iran he said that the two had discussed a variety of ways for Iran forces to leave Syria what might that mean well I have I no idea but they're always negotiating deals and negotiations but III think my position strictly is that the only way I can see it logically from a libertarian position is that people who aren't invited into a country shouldn't be there so anybody that's there that has not been invited so if somebody asks me opinion or if I were in government I would just say the people ought to leave and if it were my own government which it is right now my advice have been for a long time don't go in and leave and leave as soon as you can because it doesn't help anything and and it just leads to more trouble and it prolongs the war I mean look how long we've been in Afghanistan because of a similar situation so I have no idea what he's talking about working a deal with with the Russians on how to handle and the Iranians but this whole thing that we have said that we're our goal our stated position now I stayed by Bolton beside me and and just by the way Bolton doesn't speak for all the American people he speaks for the neo and neoconservatives but the policy now is the goal is to seek that Iran cannot export one gallon of fuel now that's absurd it's it's it's just wrong and it's just they're going to lead to more trouble and in other countries you know will be sanctioned as well and if Russia participates in helping Iran you know then we've been bold and make these wild stay it's that quite frankly we shouldn't and I'm not sure we could carry out all the threats anyway now the specter of Russian meddling came up again and apparently kept the two from signing a joint statement how long do you think that that's going to stay a sticking point between the two countries I think for a long time I don't think they're going to magically come to their senses and and that we change our policy where we're very very much engaged as intervention in interventionist and then we have the issue of NATO moving eastward and and not falling through our promises of keeping NATO away from the borders of Russia and these things just add up so I don't expect any any magic which is very very difficult for some of us to totally understand because we don't think our president really at heart is endorses all these positions you know of antagonism with Russia and yet the people he has hired do and I think that was sort of came up in that discussion at the president and and Bolton get along very well and I guess they do he he hired him but there's been a lot of us who had always been hopeful because Trump has said things favorably and has worked with Russia in the past and we'd like to just see more of us here in this country to emphasize that which means that yes it wouldn't be a bad idea for Iran to leave Syria but I think a good deal would be the American could leave Syria as well and then mind our own business so do you feel like the the topic of Russian meddling often overshadows more important topics that should be addressed in these type of meetings oh yeah I think this whole thing about Russia meddling I think every country gets involved to some degree about what's happening in other countries to what degree I don't know but I would consider how much we have done especially since World War two how many elections we've been involved in how many could coos that we have participated in including Ukraine I would say in comparison you know this current Russia gate you know event going on right now that is that is just miniscule as far as I'm concerned I think people with the discipline it way out of proportion and it's a distraction from some of the more important issues but it certainly is there I think it's been I think it's been really stimulated by our political system here that's surprised and shocked everybody that a guy like Trump won and beat the insider and beat the pic jozin person that was Clinton and they can't get over this they're hysterical about it and they even even now they take a position which they generally agreed with Liberal Democrats used to be more on the side of libertarians about non-interventional but now they're obsessed with this they're obsessed with the fact that Trump won they're gonna do anything to try to get rid of him and I think in a way Trump may be in a box because he you know might have a different position as I suggest at the same time it's really hard for him to placate both sides and I think that's impossible and that's why I've always taken the position that you take the position of what a nation that believes in Liberty I should do and practice that and and get along and talk with and trade with as many people as you can I think that is what leads to peace and prosperity which is the goal of my foundation peace and prosperity is done by talking to people and diplomacy and trading with people not threatening people and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on weapons that we don't even need and if you compare what we spend and compared to what the rest of the world is spending we're wasting a lot of money and some day we're gonna have to pay for it and then I'm going to have my we're gonna have to back off for financial reasons just as the Soviet system had to back away because it just couldn't afford it Bolton reacted to one question of a reporter asking whether or not he thought that the president was a security risk by dismissing it and saying you know have a little faith in the American people who elected him president why do you think the media continues to zero in on those types of questions and those alone more or less well yeah I now know who was bullying I believe that said this trusted in American people what he's talking about is trusting what he says but what the what the neoconservatives say isn't what the the American people voted for they voted for Trump who was an independent populist and a non interventionist to a large degree and that's why he even got libertarian votes so that's where the disconnect is that's where it's real hard to figure out what's happening what's going on but the the this statement by Bolton that the American people know it's actually what they want and he's speaking for the American people will tell you well I know a lot of American people that aren't very happy with the neoconservatives and I think they're on the defensive and it's a mixture neoconservatives infiltrate both parties and therefore sometimes you know what the Democrats do and the Republicans do behind the scene and that is to maintain the Empire that's the goal of the political system that we have and this other stuff is just distraction it's distraction on who has the power who has the purse strings who makes the decision and that is very very important and these fights are real but when it comes down to it you know they they they don't have any major just a disagreement on deficit financing central banking and the welfare state and all these issues and matter of fact there's a very little discussion real discussion on whether or not we should practice intervention is Imola Burt Ariens we don't believe in intervention ISM of our C's what we want to do is we want to be engaged overseas but we want to be engaged in friendly pursuit of Commerce former US congressman dr. Ron Paul thank you for your time and your comments you
