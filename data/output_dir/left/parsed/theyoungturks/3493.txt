>> I DON'T THINK THE LONDON
EVENING STANDARD LISTENED TO
SOLANGE KNOWLES' ALBUM, A SEAT
AT THE TABLE, SPECIFICALLY THE
SONG DON'T TOUCH MY HAIR, BEFORE
THEY FEATURED HER ON THE COVER.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PHOTO
OF THE COVER, IT LOOKS LIKE A
NORMAL COVER, WHAT COULD BE
MISSING?
SOLANGE LET THEM KNOW
WHAT WAS MISSING FROM THE COVER
SHOOT, LOOKS LIKE SHE DREW THE
CROWN THERE, AND WE HAVE THE
OTHER PHOTO FROM HER INSTAGRAM?
WE DO NOT COME ABOUT WHAT YOU
WILL SEE IS THERE IS A FULL
BRAID THAT WAS MAKING A CROWN OF
THE LAKES THAT SHE HAD DRAWN ON
THAT WAS CUT OUT FROM THE
EDITION OF THE LONDON EVENING
STANDARD, YOU CAN SEE THE FULL
IMAGE THAT WAS CUT OUT.
THIS IS
PARTICULARLY IN POOR TASTE GIVEN
WHAT THE STORY TALKS ABOUT --
>> 
HERE IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE
STORY --
>> 
THIS IS WHAT IS PARTICULARLY
INTERESTING, ONE OF THE WRITERS
OF THE STORY CAME OUT ON TWITTER
AND DISAVOWED THE STORY.
SHE SAID --
>> SOMETHING WENT AMISS HERE, WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE,
SIMONE, IT SEEMS THEY DID THIS
STORY AND JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHO
THEY WERE TALKING TO AND DIDN'T
REALLY DO RESEARCH INTO WHAT IS
IMPORTANT TO SOLANGE.
>>THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO HER
ALBUM.
IF YOU LISTEN TO HER
ALBUM YOU WOULD KNOW YOU DON'T
TOUCH HER HAIR, AND FURTHERMORE
YOU DON'T TOUCH A BLACK WOMAN'S
HAIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE STILL
HAVE TO ARGUE THIS, OR WHY THERE
IS CONFUSION OVER THIS.
I WILL
PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, THIS IS A
MAGAZINE FROM THE U.K., MAYBE
CULTURALLY THEY DON'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND THE COMPLICATED
HISTORY INVOLVING BLACK WOMEN
AND HAIR.
>>I WOULD GO WITH YOU ON THAT IF
THEY DIDN'T FULLY HAVE ACCESS TO
LISTEN TO HER DAMN ALBUM, WHERE
SHE TALKS ABOUT THIS.
>>VALID.
>>IT'S SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT
IS JUST A CASE OF JOURNALISM
GONE WRONG, AND I DO WANT TO
SALUTE ANGELICA BASTIEN BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT ON BEHIND
THE SCENES BUT I BELIEVE HER
COMPLETELY THAT SHE'S UPSET AND
IT WAS A FIASCO AND SOMETHING
WENT AMISS AND I'M SURE THIS
WASN'T THE FINAL EDITION SHE
WANTED TO PRINT.
>>IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IN A LOT OF
PUBLICATIONS FOR THE HEADLINE
WRITER AND THE PICTURE EDITOR TO
BE DISCONNECTED FROM THE STORY.
SO THAT I GET, BUT TO BE THIS
COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED, AS
THOUGH YOU JUST DIDN'T REALLY
GET IT AT ALL?
IT'S HARD TO GIVE
THEM A PASS, I THINK THIS IS A
BAD ONE.
>>AND SOLANGE BROUGHT IN HER OWN
HAIR TEAM, SHE HAD A VISION FOR
THIS PIECE, THE CIRCLE
REPRESENTS THE CONSTELLATION OF
ORION, WHICH IS SOMETHING
APPARENTLY THAT MEANS A LOT TO
HER, SO SHE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT
INTO IT, WHICH SHE DOES WITH
EVERYTHING, SO WHY WOULD YOU
ALLOW HER -- YOU SEE HER
HAIRSTYLE AS YOU ARE SHOOTING
IT, WHY WOULD YOU ALLOW HER TO
DO IT AND THEN CUT IT OUT AND
NOT THINK SHE IS GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING?
>>ALSO, WHY WOULDN'T YOU BELIEVE
THAT THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL
CHOICE?
THAT HERE IS TOO HIGH --
NOW, IT'S INTENTIONAL.
>>ALSO YOU ARE TAKING TREMENDOUS
LIBERTIES WITH SOMEONE'S LOOK.
I DON'T GET IT, I CAN'T GIVE
THEM A PASS.
>>YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN
SOLANGE, EVENING STANDARD.
>>I LOVE HER RESPONSE ON
INSTAGRAM, SHE DIDN'T EVEN SPELL
IT OUT, SHE'S LIKE #DTMH.
