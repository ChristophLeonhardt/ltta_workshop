mariya boo china made headlines last month after being arrested in the US for being a Russian agent she now faces further allegations such as luring American money to Russia RT America had a chance to speak to her lawyer the full version will be up soon on Rt America's YouTube channel well I think if you read the indictment in the case whose allege to be an agent of Russia who failed to register with the Attorney General and so essentially that means is they haven't charged with espionage and if you read the allegations against her none of the allegations or anything spy like about it essentially the government is conceding that even under their own theory if she had filed a piece of paper with the attorney general's office at the beginning of a trip to America everything she did was legal and so my point is this is more of a registration type crime than an espionage crime and yet the media and the government some extent are treating it like an espionage crime well I mean I think that that allegation was particularly damaging to Maria because it makes it more like a spy novel and frankly easier for the public to digest and so editors and and producers like those kind of allegations because it seems like oh this is more like the red sparrow that was an allegation that was set forth in a proffer by the government meaning they did not produce evidence to back up that allegation at the time we're still waiting to see that and we're not sure it exists or it exists in any meaningful form and in the interim it's very hard to see your client gotten dragged through the mud like this which is why I've been trying to push back on that you
