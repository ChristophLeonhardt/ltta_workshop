00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:10,127
>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

2
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:13,097
THIS IS CHANGING THE NATION BY

3
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,298
UNDERCUTTING THE MAIN FUNDING

4
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:17,434
AND SUPPORT OF DEMOCRAT PUBLIC

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,571
SECTOR UNION.

6
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:22,706
AT THE HEART OF THE CASE IS THE

7
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:25,542
PRACTICE OF THOSE UNIONS

8
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,678
CHARGING FEES THAT DON'T WANT

9
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:32,116
THE UNION BUT GETTING BENEFITS

10
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,951
FROM THE UNION.

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,954
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

12
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,288
JOINING ME IS TIM.

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,691
HE'S ONE OF THE BIG EXPERTS.

14
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:42,860
LET ME EXPLAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,161
OF THIS.

16
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:45,462
PARTICULARLY HOW MUCH MONEY IS

17
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,398
AT STAKE FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR

18
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:48,699
UNION.

19
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:51,335
SOME OF THE NUMBERS I HAVE SEEN

20
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:52,536
ARE HUGE.

21
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:55,806
>> YEAH, SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

22
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,007
ROUGHLY 5 MILLION GOVERNMENT

23
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,842
EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

24
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:02,813
THAT WILL BE EEQUITY

25
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:02,846
THAT WILL BE EFFUITY

26
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:02,880
THAT WILL BE EFFECTY

27
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,614
THAT WILL BE EFFECTED BY THE

28
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:04,982
DECISION.

29
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,918
IN NEW YORK ALONE 1.2 MILLION

30
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:09,753
EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE STATE OF

31
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:10,954
NEW YORK.

32
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,090
ROUGHLY 200,000 OF THEM HAVE

33
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,626
ALREADY EXERCISED THEIR RIGHT NO

34
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:22,766
OPT OUT.

35
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:26,904
ON THE DAY IT COMES DOWN YOU ARE

36
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:30,007
LOOKING AT UNIONS ON DAY ONE.

37
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,475
>> WHAT IS THE PLAY AROUND THE

38
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:33,677
REST OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF

39
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,513
THE DIFFERENT POLITICS ON THE

40
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,249
ISSUE, HOW DOES IT WORKOUT?

41
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:42,085
>> THE STATE'S POLICIES ARE, YOU

42
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,621
KNOW, DEFINITELY BY STATE.

43
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,957
EVERY STAY HAS THEIR OWN

44
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:47,558
INDIVIDUAL.

45
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:49,560
AGAIN, WE ARE LOOKING AT NUMBERS

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,196
THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT.

47
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,932
5 MILLION ACROSS JUST OVER 20

48
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,034
STATES AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

49
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:01,405

ALLOW AS 80,000.

52
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,078
>> HOW LONG HAS THIS BE GOING

53
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,413
THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

54
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:12,516
WHEN CAN YOU EXPECT THE RULING?

55
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,685
>> THIS CASE WITH WAS HEARD IN

56
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,386
FEBRUARY.

57
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:20,224
IT'S A CONTINUE

58
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,593
IT'S A CONTINUATION IN A CASE

59
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:23,694
HEARD IN 2013.

60
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:25,796
THE RULING WILL BE HEARD IN A

61
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:27,130
FEW DAYS NOW.

62
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,032
THEY COULD HAND DOWN A DECISION

63
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,767
TOMORROW OR AS LATE AS THE END

64
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:34,671
OF THEIR SESSION IN 27th OR

65
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,806
28th.

66
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:45,115
>> WHEN YOU SAY THIS IS A BIG

67
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:45,449
IMPACT.

68
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,351
THE ORGANIZE IS AT THE PORT.

69
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,254
IN MANY WAYS, IT'S SUCH A COOL

70
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,756
PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

71
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,624
AESOP RATION.

72
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,559
THAT'S WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE

73
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:55,859
HERE.

74
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,462
HOW THEY ARE REACTING TO THIS

75
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:01,698
FATAL BLOW, YOU KNOW NOT FATAL

76
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,801
BUT CRIPPLING BLOW.

77
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,270
TOUCH AND TALK ABOUT THE

78
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,572
GOVERNMENT UNIONS AS A MOVEMENT

79
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,107
IN THEMSELVES.

80
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,541
CERTAINLY HERE IN NEW YORK AND

81
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,543
STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE

82
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:16,079
UNIONS ARE A POLITICAL THING

83
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,016
THAT ARE RECKONED TO BE DEALT

84
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:19,316
WITH.

85
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,051
THEY ORGANIZE, THEY ARE INVOLVED

86
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:23,086
IN LOBBYING AND STATEHOUSES IN

87
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,988
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

88
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:28,158
THEY ARE INVOLVED IN POLITICAL

89
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:28,625
CAMPAIGNS.

90
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,061
>> YOU KNOW, EVERY DOLLARS THAT

91
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,896
COMES AWAY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT

92
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,832
ON THEIR ABILITY TO ORGANIZE AND

93
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,669
IMPACT POLICY AND ELECTION.

94
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,070
STEVE: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

95
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,105
THAT'S A GREAT SUMMERY OF ALL OF

96
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:43,106
THAT.

97
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,741
WE'LL WATCH FOR THE RESULTS.

98
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:48,145
WE THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

99
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,113
>> THANK YOU.

100
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,416
STEVE: JASON, LET'S GO TO YOUR

101
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:52,716
LIST.

102
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,751
THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS

103
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:55,886
SO INTERESTING.

104
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,021
I WANT TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT

105
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:05,896
OF THE POPULOUS MOVEMENT.

106
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:07,497
THEY ARE TOO WEAK IN AMERICA.

107
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,733
YOU HAVE A LOT OF ABUSE IN

108
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,169
WORKERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

109
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,305
THE ROLE OF SUB LICK SECTORS IS

110
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:21,577
INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF

111
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:22,746
BLOCKING THINGS.

112
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,915
>> THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SUPREME

113
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:25,816
COURT RULING.

114
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:28,251
THEY ARE TAKING MILLIONS OF

115
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:33,190
DOLLARS AND GALVINIZE THOUSANDS

116
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,625
OF PEOPLE AND LOBBY TO ELECT

117
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:35,992
DEMOCRATS.

118
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,961
THESE ARE FEDERAL WORKERS THAT

119
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,063
MANY OF THEM WORK 100% OF THEIR

120
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,734
TIME ON UNION ACTIVITY.

121
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,302
STEVE: IS THAT TRUE?

122
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:48,138
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

123
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:50,407
>> THEY WILL TAKE FEDERAL

124
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:54,144
TAXPAYER DOLLARS, THEY GET

125
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,645
BENEFITS, AND HEALTHCARE AND

126
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:58,281
WORK ON UNION ACTIVITY.

127
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:02,452
>> THAT DOESN'T COUNT AS

128
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:03,720
CAMPAIGNING.

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,622
>> WE ARE FUNDING IT.

130
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,692
>> IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

131
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,227
THINGS OF ALL-TIMES.

132
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:14,164
THIS IS CORRUPTION AT THE

133
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,165
HIGHEST LEVEL.

134
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:18,068
THEY ARE WORKING ON BEHALF OF

135
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,736
THE WHOLE MOVEMENT TO GET OUT

136
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,537
THE VOTE.

137
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,973
THEY ARE THERE ON ELECTION DAY.

138
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:26,176
LITERALLY WHILE ON THE FEDERAL

139
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,110
DIME AND GETTING PAID AND

140
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,446
PUTTING FORWARD THEIR OWN

141
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:29,846
CANDIDATES.

142
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:33,116
THEY USE THE POWER TO ALSO

143
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:34,518
BOYCOTT OTHERS AND CREATE MESS

144
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:38,755
IN THE AREA AND TOTAL

145
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,792
PANDEMONIUM SO NO ONE CAN GET

146
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,293
BUSINESS DONE AND THEY SHUT YOU

147
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,394
DOWN.

148
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,563
>> WHAT THE SUPREME COURT IS

149
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,365
LOOKING AT IS THERE IS THE UNION

150
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,200
AND YOU DECIDE I DON'T WANT TO

151
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,735
BE IN THE UNION.

152
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:55,272
YOU TAKE 78% OF THE DUES OUT OF

153
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:55,972
YOUR CHUCK.

154
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:58,408
THEY TAKE IT AND POUR IT IN THE

155
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,044
UNION EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO

156
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,546
DO IT.

157
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:04,581
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY PUBLIC

158
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,384
TECH

159
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:07,417
SECH

160
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,419
SECTOR UNIONS.

161
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,523
THE POINT OF THE UNION.

162
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:16,760
>> THEY CALL THEMSELVES LABOR.

163
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,829
>> WHY DO YOU NORMALLY HAVE A

164
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,864
UNION IF YOU ARE A FIELD WORKER

165
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:22,165
OR PIPEFITTERS?

166
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:29,339
IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

167
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,776
CAPITALIST OBJECTION.

168
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,278
THE GOVERNMENT UNION IS THE GUY

169
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:41,485
WHO NEEDS YOUR VOTE AND

170
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:41,852
ORGANIZES.

171
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:44,421
THEY ARE BUYING THEIR OWN

172
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:44,921
BOSSES.

173
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,357
IT'S UTTERLY CORRUPTION FROM THE

174
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:48,625
GET GO.

175
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,228
>> THAT'S BRILLIANT.

176
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:57,334
>> I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE GIVE

177
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:02,973
INTELLECTUAL BACKUPS.

178
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:03,507
>> RIGHT.

179
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,542
>> THEY ARE GETTING SMALLER AND

180
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:05,876
WEAKER.

181
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,577
THEY ARE GETTING ROUGH.

182
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,880
THEY TAKE ALL OF THEIR MONEY AND

183
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,516
NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HELP THEM.

184
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,353
THEY ARE USING THEM AND MAKING

185
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:16,853
THEM.

186
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:23,126
IT'S LIKE FORCED LABOR FOR THE

187
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:25,028
POLITICAL AGENDAS

188
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,163
STEVE: THEY BLOCK REALLY

189
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:33,503
IMPULSIVE THINGS.

190
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:36,439
>> IT SEEMS LIKE AN EDUCATION.

191
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,309
