few videos in February although I can't

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,040
promise every day videos and I do need

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get on with my dissertation oh really</font>

49
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's taught me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot particularly about</font>

50
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,130
self motivation something that I used to

51
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the sort of faded away</font>

52
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,009
for a little while the thing is when you

53
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,270
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a video every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single day</font>

54
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,710
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow time to do that</font>

55
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,270
meaning you have to structure everything

56
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,009
else about your day meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bulk</font>

57
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,600
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> project I was getting up at six</font>

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,890
in the morning and you know how they say

59
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,780
it takes 21 days for something to become

60
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,280
habit I completely believe that cuz I

61
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,479
don't think without this project it

62
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,950
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural for me to come up at</font>

63
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,180
six in the morning from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new year</font>

64
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,680
revolution I've also like to spend more

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">time outside to thank and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make eye</font>

contact with and say I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> you too</font>

67
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,530
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often to give myself creative tasks</font>

68
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,180
such as things like sprinting even

69
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,950
though it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanowrimo to paint and</font>

70
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,629
try harder origami to make even more

71
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,099
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the Brewster's at</font>

72
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,900
coffee shops to read more wisely when I

73
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,610
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a magazine then to occasionally</font>

74
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,200
maybe part with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> books in the</font>

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,090
platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> railway station if it has</font>
