a hate preacher calling for the genocide of Jews on the streets of Toronto or an evangelical church group just trying to feed the hungry can you guess which one got summer jobs funding from the Liberal government Who am I kidding you guys absolutely already know the answer to this over the weekend alkyds day demonstrations were held in cities all across the world now alkyds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem and the rallies are held on the last Friday or Saturday after Ramadan the day was decreed by the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 basically to show support for the Palestinians and oh yeah call for the destruction of the State of Israel and of all of the cities in Canada where these rallies are held Toronto is consistently consistently the worst year after year you can see Hezbollah flags flown on the streets of Toronto and calls for genocide against Jews are made right out in the open in fact for two years in a row now the outcodes protests have been taking place in a City of Toronto public park right behind the Ontario legislature without any sort of permits or permission and both city hall and the former Liberal government in Toronto have seemed to turn a blind eye to it all I mean just look at this video of this hate preacher here this took place in Toronto over the weekend right out in the open just watch this is our prayer to the Almighty Creator whether you call him God or Allah you call him Joe but whatever name you want to call him we pray to the Creator to the Almighty a day will come when we will see justice throughout the world the eradication of the unjust powers such as the American Empire such as the Israelis and scientists and said same way that we saw the British Empire wither away the Sun never set on it the Sun sets on it we will see a day coming in sha Allah God willing in our lifetime where this Empire the Zionist Empire the American Empire will be down in the dustbins of history insha Allah don't worry a lot my gender I mean that was absolutely outrageous it's so bad that brand-new Ontario Premier Doug Ford has said that he's going to crack down on it tweeting that blatantly racist or anti-semitic ideology should never be permitted on the grounds of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario or anywhere else in this province now look I don't believe in the concept of hate speech hate is a human emotion and you just can't outlaw those but calls to violence are different in that they can be both incitement to violence and violent threats and both of those things are against the law and I think that if a group of let's say neo-nazis we're saying these same things about Jews which they have and they do I'm sure you would agree with me that Toronto Mayor John Tory and liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne would have been ferocious in their denouncement of such a hateful rally so I guess why the double standard here and now but I've got another problem with all of this that man in the video that I showed you earlier calling for the eradication of Israelis calling for genocide really well his name is Sheikh Shafiq Hooda of the Islamic humanitarian service of Kitchener Ontario his organization if you can believe it is a registered charity within Canada and this year he got a summer jobs grant from the Liberal government of Canada I had seen an MP tweet about this on Twitter and I couldn't believe it so I actually went to the database that the government keeps of their summer jobs grants and you know what sure enough there it was the Islamic humanitarian service of Kitchener Ontario that means this organization which seems pretty fundamentalist Islamists if you ask me must have signed the attestation to support the Liberal Party of Canada's values and opinions on LGBTQ and abortion rights really I guess that begs the question do we really think this guy this shake Shafiq Hooda is really okay with gay and transgender people really really or was he just okay to lie on his access station get access to that sweet sweet government grant cash I don't know about you but I suspect he lied right through his pearly teeth this guy got a grant to hire people to work in his so-called charity when evangelical groups like the mustard seed couldn't get a grant to make sandwiches to feed the inner-city hungry homeless and poor because the mustard seed refuses to sign away their right to be pro-life in the rest of their ministry it is absolutely revolting one could reasonably surmise that according to this social justice Liberal government it's okay to publicly espouse to want to murder Jewish people that's something that can be overlooked in the name of tolerance to get you some charity funding because all of a sudden the Liberals become free speech advocates or something as long as you're not pro-life but don't you dare let someone's filthy baby loving pro-life hands touch a roast beef sandwich meant to ease the growls of a homeless hungry belly because according to the Liberals that my friends is hateful for the rabble dot media I'm Shiela gun Reid I have a brand new book out it's called the case against David Suzuki an unauthorized biography and it is available for free for
