the only way I'll disagree with you I do think that it will help him and it'll specially help him after he's received some criticism earlier this week but he wasn't sufficiently extreme enough when it came to immigration this helps to fix some of that for him but it's also possible as has been the case a couple of times last year that his public comments are in this case private comments that have been revealed could be used by judges to potentially influence whether they allow or don't allow some of his executive orders of legislation it means previous comments about Muslims were used several times to strike down the Muslim ban so maybe this could hurt him in terms of that so there could be like a silver lining to this horrible a public out racism yeah there's a silver lining to the shithole that we're in as a society right now what what bothers you Liv what bothers me is this kind of reminds me of a little while ago when the tax bill came out and the corporate media you know you saw about 16 or 17 headlines about Flynn that day and one about the tax bill similarly you know you saw about I don't even know how many headlines about shithole and a bunch of cable news reporters were probably really geeking out they could say shit all on the air knowing they knew anything about it well simultaneously at all the time that if we want throw maybe we take it for granted so as you pointed out people might not be all that shocked to find out that Donald Trump is a racist although again the media all too often doesn't label him that but it wasn't just him one of the things that's I think good about this particular situation is after it came out that he said it a lot of people both in the right-wing media but also politicians had an opportunity to either denounce him or not and a lot of the pundits have lined up and said no we too agree with this and whether they're on TV or their writers or their you know whatever a lot of them are saying that that they also believe this some however are just being cowardly about it so while dick Durbin was at the meeting and he remembers what was said senators Tom cotton and David Perdue said they quote do not recall the president making those remarks which I believe is one of two things either they're lying and they know what he said and it's a stupid cowardly lie because they know it's gonna be confirmed anyway or they so agree with these sorts of thoughts and find them to be so innocuous and run-of-the-mill then they didn't even notice when it happened it was just like oh yeah and that bad happened I agree president why do we need Asians but I know some people watching the show might think that we are too quick to label people as racists and even though you've already given a number of great examples of past statements just in case here's a couple of other things some of which came out today this is a story of that I believe the New York Times or NBC News came out with this a career intelligence analyst who is an expert in hostage policy stood before President Donald Trump in the Oval Office last fall it was her first time meeting the president and when she was done briefing him he had a question for where are you from the president asked New York she replied Trump was unsatisfied and asked again she offered that she too was from Manhattan like he is he wanted to know where quote your people are from according to officials who spoke at her condition of anonymity after the analysts revealed that her parents are Korean turned to an adviser in the room and asked why the pretty Korean lady isn't negotiating with North Korea on his administration's behalf basically creating the situation that many people have unfortunately had to deal with with old-school racists like this where well yeah I know you're from Milwaukee but where are you from also by the way according to New York Times Trump said during a meeting in June that Haitians quote all have AIDS which we have looked into and you will be pleased to find out it's not actually the case they don't all have AIDS and during that same interview Trump said that Nigerian immigrants wouldn't ever quote go back to their Hut in Africa but please tell us how we are too quick to label people as racists and were just snowflakes anyway now that you know what asked me where I was in the White House yeah Trump would say a jimmy dore were you from and I would say Chicago and he'd go no where are you from I never got I don't know he's wanting me to say Ireland yes I would never say Ireland that was my money he would never expect you to okay you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
