1
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,110
My first thought when
watching the coverage was

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,530
that those 13 people
are going to die.

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,180
I think one of
the biggest jobs

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,650
those rescue divers had 
was keeping the children calm.

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,940
Whoever is in that
litter has likely spent

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,990
a very, very long time
in freezing cold water.

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,810
Those emergency blankets,
or space blankets,

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,710
do a decent job at
retaining body heat.

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,560
They basically bundled
these children

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,070
using a flexible
plastic stretcher.

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,460
In the way that these divers
navigate appears to be

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,650
using a static line
that was most likely

13
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,070
bolted into the rock face
and anchored permanently,

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,170
or semi-permanently,
in that way

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,900
so that the divers were able
to simply follow that line.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,531
The person 
on the left has

17
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,900
basic open-circuit 
scuba equipment.

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,520
You can see that 
silver air cylinder.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,110
And the person 
on the right

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,620
actually has what’s 
called a “rebreather.”

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,650
It actually allows you
to dive for much longer

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,370
than a standard 
scuba system.

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,040
So the reason 
to have two tanks:

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,580
One is redundancy.

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,280
If say there’s an equipment
failure with the first tank

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,780
you could switch your
regulator over and

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,280
breathe off 
the second tank.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,510
The other reason
would be to extend

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,220
the duration of the dive so
that you could switch over

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,740
to a second tank if
you’re running low on air

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,590
on the first tank.

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,650
It seemed like a really
impossible situation.

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,241
So I was absolutely amazed
that they got everybody out

34
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,850
and that the only —
that they only suffered

35
00:01:55,850 --> 00:00:00,000
one fatality and that that
was one of the rescue divers.
