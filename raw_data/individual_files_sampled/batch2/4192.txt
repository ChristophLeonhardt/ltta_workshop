in January The New Yorker had a scoop about presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner this is before Kushner was downgraded in terms of his security clearance before the White House stopped allowing him to have access to highly classified information but Evan Osnos and Adam entus at the New Yorker in January they were able to report out for the first time a bunch of stuff about Jared Kushner that was unnerving in terms of national security that's where we first learned that despite mr. Kushner's inability to get a permanent security clearance he nevertheless was receiving the president's Daily Brief from the intelligence community every day that's where we learned that it wasn't just the president who was throwing intelligence protocols out the window holding conversations with foreign leaders on his own with note note-taker no staff president no briefing it was also Jared Kushner doing the same thing that New Yorker report that said that in particular mr. Kirschner was known to repeatedly take unstaffed meetings with the Chinese ambassador to the United States including at least one occasion in which they met alone which you're not supposed to do that article is where we learned that Jared Kushner did this sort of thing with the Chinese ambassador and kept doing it even though he was warned personally by the top counterintelligence official at the FBI that he Jared Kushner personally was the target of a Chinese influence operation by Chinese intelligence a head of the Chinese president going to Mara Lago in April last year US surveillance intercepted Chinese officials saying that in meetings preparing for the mar-a-lago summit Jared Kushner had discussed his own business interests with the Chinese ambassador along with US policy quote some intelligence officials became concerned that the Chinese government was seeking to use business inducements to influence mr. Kushner last fall in November 2017 Jared went along on the president's trip to China after they all came home from that trip in December 2017 quote US intelligence agencies briefed a wider circle of Trump administration officials telling them that a member of the president's family was being targeted by a Chinese influence operation so just ate a blockbuster story from The New Yorker in January works at the white house can't fire someone from the job of son-in-law right but he reportedly no longer has access to classified information and now apart from turning up at places like last night's state dinner mr. Kirschner has been keeping a much lower profile well mail new scoop fresh off winning a freaking Pulitzer Prize last week for his reporting on Harvey Weinstein Ronan Farrow who also writes for The New Yorker has a new book out which has a whole bunch of scoops in it the one that rings like a bell for me in terms of national security worries in this White House is a scoop about Jared Kushner and and it arrives right in the middle of a story about Rex Tillerson screwing something up here's the story it starts on page 290 of Ronan's book quote during teller son's first trip to China as Secretary of State he and President Xi Jinping sat in matching taupe leather armchairs in front of a mural of Chinese pastoral beauty cranes soaring over pristine valleys and forests they were matching red ties and dark jackets and in a move that left close followers of us-chinese relations a gape they used matching language President Xi urged the United States to expand cooperative areas and achieve win-win results Tillerson agreed the US side is ready to develop relations with China based on the principle of no conflict no confrontation mutual respect and win-win cooperation a lay observer might have blinked and missed it but Asia experts at the State Department and Beyond saw something unusual immediately Tillerson had all but copy and pasted earlier statements by xi who just a few months before had expressed hope that President Trump would uphold the principles of non conflict non-confrontation mutual respect and win-win cooperation that's exactly what Tillerson said that was the most recent of many examples of she and other communist officials using that coded sequence of terms to describe a new balance of powers with China as an equal to the US and the u.s. deferring to Chinese prerogatives on contentious issues from Taiwan to territorial disputes in the South China Sea state-run Chinese media instantly picked up a the dog whistle Tillerson has implicitly endorsed the new model of major power relations crowed the Communists affiliated Global Times saying Rex's language had given us allies in the Asia Pacific region an impression that China and the US are equal as Barack Obama refused to do so why did Rex Tillerson do that right whether or not you care about us in China one basic thing to understand about the fundamental relationship between us and the most populous country on earth this other rising superpower is that China wants us to but out of everything that interests them they want to be seen as big and powerful and rich and influential enough that we should never deign to say anything to them about their actions we should let them operate at will that's what they want from the United States and no we're not going to war with China but in foreign relations and diplomacy and foreign policy they've got this specific coded language they have been seeking from the United States to show okay we agree we capitulate to that idea you do whatever you want we'll stay out of it so it's a really big deal that Rex Tillerson went over to China and used that coded language he recited their script word for word exactly what they want I mean that we know from public reporting but then Ronin reporting this book he gets an interview with Tillerson for the book he also gets an interview with Tillerson sort of right-hand guy at the State Department and bronan asks him point-blank quote did Tillerson intend to mirror the language I asked Brian hook quote he's not intending to mirror their language but is he aware that's what he did answer he signs off on every statement he delivers so it kind of seems like Rex Tillerson might not have known Rex Tillerson stop staff seemed surprised to learn that what Rex Tillerson said in China was a script from the Chinese government with the u.s. agreeing to treat them away we have never agreed to before but that they have been demanding I mean Rex Tillerson went over there and gave in to that demand without seeming to know that he was doing it so where did that come from where did that script come from how did that language get into Rex Tillerson 'he's prepared remarks for his china trip back to the book page 291 well several officials told me the State Department's regional experts attuned to the significance of such language have not been consulted on Tillerson statement in China instead it had been drafted by the White House according to several sources there it was drafted by the office of Jared Kushner Oh seems like a big deal particularly what we also know about repeated FBI counterintelligence warnings to the White House about mr. Kushner as a target of Chinese foreign influence operations we also learn in the book that Rex Tillerson blames Jared Kushner for pushing him out as Secretary of State apparently because Rex thinks Jared ultimately wants the Secretary of State job himself which will be hard one with no security clearance but oh wait there's more hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
