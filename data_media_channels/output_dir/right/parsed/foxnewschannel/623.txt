ISLAMIC STATE.
BRIAN IS LIVE.
WHERE DID THE ISIS CLAIM COME
FROM EXACTLY?
>> GOOD MORNING, JULIE.
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT
TORONTO POLICE ARE STILL
INVESTIGATING THE MOTIVE BEHIND
SUNDAY NIGHT'S MASS SHOOTING
THAT LEFT TWO PEOPLE DEAD AND
13 OTHERS WOUNDED.
HOWEVER, THIS MORNING ON
OFFICIAL ISIS MEDIA THE
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SHOOTING
CARRIED OUT BY 29-YEAR-OLD
FAISAL HUSSEIN.
THE CLAIM SAYS THE ATTACKER IN
THE CITY OF TORONTO IN
SOUTHEASTERN CANADA SUNDAY
NIGHT WAS A SOLDIER OF THE
ISLAMIC STATE AND HE CARRIED
OUT THE ATTACK IN RESPONSE TO
THE CALL TO TARGET CITIZENS OF
COALITION NATIONS.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE
THAT ISIS HAS FALSELY CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS IN
THE PAST AND NO EVIDENCE HAS
BEEN PROVIDED TO BACK UP THIS
PARTICULAR CLAIM.
YESTERDAY, THOUGH, CANADA'S
AT THIS STAGE BASED ON THE
STATE OF THE INVESTIGATION
WHICH IS LED BY THE TORONTO
POLICE SERVICE, THERE IS NO
CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT
INDIVIDUAL AND NATIONAL
SECURITY.
AND STRUGGLED WITH PSYCHOSIS
AND DEPRESSION HIS ENTIRE LIFE.
MEDICATIONS AND THERAPY DID NOT
WORK AND THEY EXPRESSED THEIR
DEEP CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS
AS WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE TWO KILLED IN THE ATTACK.
THE 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL HAS BEEN
IDENTIFIED.
THE 18-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ALSO.
SHE WAS KILLED AS SHE WAS OUT
CELEBRATING A FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY.
SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO COLLEGE
TO STUDY NURSING.
PROPOSAL TO BAN HANDGUNS AFTER
THIS SHOOTING.
TELL US ABOUT IT.
>> THE PUBLIC SAFETY MINISTER
SAYS THAT PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN
TRUDEAU'S GOVERNMENT IS
PREPARED TO CONSIDER AN
OUTRIGHT BAN ON HANDGUNS.
HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS
PREPARED TO CONSIDER THE
ARGUMENTS FOR SUCH A BAN AND
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.
IT IS ALREADY MUCH HARDER TO
ACQUIRE GUNS LEGALLY IN CANADA
THAN THE UNITED STATES.
