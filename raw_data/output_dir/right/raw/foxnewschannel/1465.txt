1
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:10,579
KIM JONG-UN IS THE BIG WINNER.

2
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:14,650
>> NANCY PELOSI TALKING ABOUT

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,285
THIS LETTER THAT THE PRESIDENT

4
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:18,354
TWEETED OUT HIMSELF.

5
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:20,222
AMONG THE OUTREACH THOUGH IS A

6
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:21,624
FUTURE LINE IN HERE, IF YOU

7
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:24,260
CHANGE YOUR MIND, HAVING TO DO

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,329
WITH THIS MOST IMPORTANT SUMMIT

9
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,197
PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL

10
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:29,165
ME OR WRITE.

11
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:36,572
THE WORLD AND NORTH KOREA

12
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:40,576
PARTICULARLY HAS MISSED A

13
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:42,345
OPPORTUNITY IS TRULY SAD MOMENT

14
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:44,613
IN HISTORY.

15
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:49,952
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL.

16
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:51,587
TOM, YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS

17
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:52,922
ALL CAME DOWN TODAY.

18
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:55,424
>> I THINK THE BASIC POINT HERE

19
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:57,059
IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,162
LEAVING CLEARLY AN OPENING TO

21
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:02,031
TOWARDS CONTINUING THE SUMMIT ON

22
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:05,501
JUNE 12th AS PREVIOUSLY BEEN

23
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:05,868
ARRANGED.

24
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:08,070
IN MY OPINION THAT WILL HAPPEN.

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,472
I THINK YOU SEE COMING FROM

26
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:11,941
BEHIND THE SCENES HERE IS A

27
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:12,875
PRESSURE CALCULATION ON THE PART

28
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,744
OF THE CHINESE TO SEE HOW FAR

29
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:16,679
THEY CAN PUSH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

30
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:19,382
I THINK THE CANCELLATION WAS

31
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:21,917
DIRECTED AT BEIJING AS WELL.

32
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:25,087
THE SECOND PART KIM JONG-UN

33
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:28,057
RECOGNIZES THE SYMBOLISM OF THE

34
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:30,393
ATTENDING OF THE SENATE IS AS

35
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:32,728
COMPLICATED AS CONCESSIONS HE IS

36
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:33,796
EXPECTED TO MAKE.

37
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:35,898
THINK THE SUMMIT WILL GO AHEAD

38
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:36,832
ON JUNE 12th.

39
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:38,834
>> TO THAT POINT A FOX NEWS

40
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:39,869
ALERT HERE.

41
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,172
IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS NORTH

42
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:45,975
KOREA SAYS TRUMP'S DECISION TO

43
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:48,411
SCRAP THE SUMMIT IS NOT IN LINE

44
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:51,247
WITH THE WORLD'S WISHES.

45
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,015
NORTH KOREA SAYS THEY'RE WILLING

46
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,451
TO RESOLVE ISSUES WITH THE U.S.,

47
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,420
KA * ACCORDING TO STATE RUN

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,188
MEDIA. THIS DEVELOPS BY THE DAY,

49
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:00,356
BY THE HOUR.

50
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:00,689
PHOLGY.

51
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,691
>>

52
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,794
MOLLY.>> I THINK IT'S DISAPPOINI

53
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:05,361
MOLLY.>> I THINK IT'S DISAPPOING

54
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:07,830
BUT NOT COMPLETELY SURPRISING.

55
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,699
YOU SEE NORTH KOREA AND THE U.S.

56
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,635
PRETTY FAR APART.

57
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,070
NORTH KOREA PROPOSED WHAT WE

58
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,072
HAVE SEEN IN PAST DECADES.

59
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:19,608
A PLEDGE TO EVENTUALLY

60
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:20,076
DENUCLEARIZE.

61
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,211
THE U.S. SAYS THAT WON'T WORK

62
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:22,545
ANYMORE.

63
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,346
WE WANT IT UP FRONT,

64
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:25,881
ACCOUNTABILITY AND A TIMELINE.

65
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,451
WE HEARD COMMUNICATIONS HAD

66
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,251
BROKEN DOWN.

67
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,587
I AGREE WITH TOM IT'S NOT THE

68
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:33,622
END OF THE LINE BUT A

69
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:34,623
NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

70
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:36,025
WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THE

71
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,993
REPORT HERE IS PEOPLE WERE

72
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,428
CAREFUL WHETHER NORTH KOREA

73
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:40,930
WOULD SAY WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE

74
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,465
THIS HAPPEN AND WORK TOWARDS IT

75
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,200
OR IF THEY WOULD RESPOND WITH

76
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,370
THE MISSILE TESTS AND OTHER

77
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,338
BELLIGERENT ATTITUDES.

78
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,674
IT'S A LONG BALL GAME STILL.

79
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:54,977
>> AMY WE'RE GETTING FROM THE

80
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:57,012
NORTH KOREANS THAT NORTH KOREA

81
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:59,014
IS WILLING TO TALK TO THE UNITED

82
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:01,383
STATES ANYTIME IN A RESPONSE OF

83
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:03,519
THE DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,154
SUMMIT SAYING THEY WANT TO

85
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:06,255
RESOLVE THE ISSUES.

86
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:09,391
YOU HEARD SENATOR MCCONNEL SAY

87
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:12,128
THE NEXT STEP IS NORTH KOREA'S

88
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:12,761
AND THIS IS IT.

89
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,598
>> I'M FASCINATED TO WATCH THE

90
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,433
WAY IN WHICH AMERICANS ARE

91
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,234
REACTING TO THIS.

92
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:19,835
TAKE AWAY THE BACK AND FORTH

93
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:22,171
HERE IN WASHINGTON.

94
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:23,973
IN POLLING WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE

95
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:25,407
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS IS ACROSS

96
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:28,144
THE BOARD THIS IS REPUBLICANS,

97
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:30,679
DEMOCRATS, AND INDEPENDENTS WERE

98
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,481
GIVEN THE IDEA OF A SIT DOWN

99
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:35,251
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND KIM

100
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,452
JONG-UN HIGH MARKS.

101
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:39,221
THEY LIKED THE IDEA.

102
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:43,159
IN THE LAST CNN POLL PEOPLE SAW

103
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,896
THIS AS TRUMP'S MOST POSITIVE

104
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:49,698
MOVE AND HE RECEIVED HIS HIGHEST

105
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:49,999
MARKS.

106
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,834
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OVER ALL IS

107
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,402
SAYING I LIKE WHERE THIS IS

108
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:54,803
GOING, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

109
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:57,006
LIKE THIS, LET'S TROY IT.

110
00:03:57,006 --> 00:04:00,876
IF THIS GOES WILDLY OFF TRACK OR

111
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:03,112
THE SUMMIT DOESN'T HAPPEN OR

112
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,114
MORE SABER RATTLING FROM NORTH

113
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,449
KOREA OR SOUTH KOREA DOES

114
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:09,585
SOMETHING THERE IS A CONTINUING

115
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:12,488
SORT OF CHAOS, DOES THAT THEN

116
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:14,356
ULTIMATELY IMPACT THE WAY THAT

117
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:15,624
VOTERS NOT ONLY SEE THE

118
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:17,493
PRESIDENT BUT ULTIMATELY THE WAY

119
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,896
HE HANDLES ANY OTHER FOREIGN

120
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:22,431
POLICY OR FOREIGN POLICY CRISIS?

121
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:24,099
>> RIGHT.

122
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:26,302
TOM, QUICKLY WRAP THIS UP.

123
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:28,837
>> YES, I THINK THE NORTH

124
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:31,006
KOREAN'S KNOW THEY HAVE A

125
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,541
INTEREST SKPEUGT DOWN AT THE

126
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,242
SUMMIT.

127
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:34,076
BEIJING WANTS THIS.

128
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:36,745
THEY WANT TO SEE IT TRUMP IS

129
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,380
MALLABLE.

130
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,149
THE LETTER SUGGESTS HE IS NOT.

131
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,483
THE MESSAGE WE SEE FROM THE

132
00:04:41,483 --> 00:00:00,000
NORTH, THAT'S AS NICE AS IT GETS
