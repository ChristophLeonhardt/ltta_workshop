better O'Rourke is challenging Ted Cruz in the Senate race in Texas and giving him quite a race and he was recently speaking with a group of constituents or potential constituents who asked him a question about the NFL protests and his response thanks to now this has gone mega viral here was what better overwork said he'll disrespectful it is like you have the NFL players kneeling during the national anthems I wanted to know if you found that disrespectful to our country to our veterans and anybody related to that II just I find it incredibly frustrating um my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful here's my longer parting the waters and the King years and and when you read that book and find out what dr. King and this nonviolent peaceful movement to secure better because they didn't get full civil rights for their fellow Americans that challenges that they face those who died in Philadelphia Mississippi for the crime of trying to be a man trying to be a woman in this country the the young girls who died in the church bombing those who were beaten within an inch of their life crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma Alabama with John Lewis those who were punched in the face spat upon dragged out by their collar at the Woolworth lunch counter for sitting with white people at the same lunch counter in the same country where their fathers may have bled the same blood on the battlefields of Omaha Beach or Okinawa or anywhere that anyone ever served this country the freedoms that we have were purchased not just by those in uniform and they definitely were but also by those who took their lives into their hands riding those Greyhound buses the Freedom Riders in the deep south 1960 peaceful nonviolent protests including taking a knee at a football game to point out that black men unarmed black teenagers unarmed and black children unarmed are being killed at a frightening level right now including by members of law enforcement without accountability and without justice and this problem as grave as it is is not going to fix itself and they're frustrated frankly with people like me and those in positions of public trust and power who have been unable to resolve this or bring justice for what has been done and to stop it from continuing to happen in this country and so non-violently peacefully while the eyes of this country are watching these games they take a knee to bring our attention and our focus to this problem to ensure that we fix it that is why they are doing it and I can think of nothing more American than to peacefully stand up or taking these anytime that's a man so he was asked a question by someone who clearly does not agree with him and what do politicians do 99 out of 100 times you know they they cater to them they you know they equivocate and they said well a little bit of this and a little bit of that and they try to avoid controversy try to avoid disagreement and Beto said no this is what I believe and he laid out an excellent case for exactly why they take a knee and it doesn't have anything new with the veterans and in fact they colin kaepernick consulted with veterans even before taking it a knee and they told him and the folks that he could consulted with said taking me was the most respectful way of doing it yeah and so better or or pointing that out is a guy who is a rare brave politician he's going to beat Ted Cruz a first of all polling now indicates one post got him down only by four they thought that Ted Cruz couldn't lose in Texas I think one poll had him by it down by only one so here comes better or Roarke on the one hand you've got Ted Cruz who's going around kissing Donald Trump's ass all over the country begging him to come to Texas after Donald Trump insulted his wife called his dad a murderer he's now unmanned himself in front of the whole country Ted Cruz says I thought in Texas you had to be strong to win Ted Cruz is the weakest guy I've ever seen compared to this strength he's gonna get clobbered so and beyond that LeBron James and so many other celebrities shared this video saying that is exactly right if you want to know what we think that's what we think by the way that's what a representative is supposed to do represent you have you heard about the new TYT audio network we have some great new shows for you find us wherever you get your podcast by searching for tyt network or head over to TYT dot-com / audio
