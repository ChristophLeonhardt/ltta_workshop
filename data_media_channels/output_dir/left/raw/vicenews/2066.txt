1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,200
The Protestors are probably on the same side as the people within the facility

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,160
everybody wants to no longer have to use the animals

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
Vice News gained rare access to a non for profit science laboratory

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,320
which tests some of the world's most deadly infections and diseases on live monkeys

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,720
The facility is called the Biomedical Primate Research Center

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,840
or BPRC

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
and they're allowing us to film inside to see with our own eyes

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,200
if monkey testing and animal welfare can go hand in hand

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,800
Testing on non human primates has left to breakthroughs

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,360
such as a polio vaccine and treatments against HIV and AIDS

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
and the BPRC is the largest facility of its kind in Europe

12
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,400
it's considered to be one the most forward thinking and progressive research centers

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
for housing and caring for its monkeys

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
but they are still the focus of animal rights activists

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,600
who have continued to protest outside the center

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
for the last 20 years

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,280
They are protesting against what is happening in the facility

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,920
No one gets in without noticing that these people are here

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
We wanted to understand why it is still necessary

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,160
to develop life-saving drugs through experiments on live monkeys

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,120
and how the animals are being treated

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
So, where are we?

23
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,000
This is our breeding facility

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Over here are 1200 Rhesus macaques

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,160
We have around 150 long-tail macaques

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,160
and we have 200-250 common macaques

27
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,080
The protesters called this place the monkey hell of Rijswijk

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
How do you relate to that?

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,600
Officially, I do not agree with how they call

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Because as of 1996

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,160
we started to create these breeding groups

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,400
that look much more like how you would find these groups in the wild

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,760
young males, about 4-5 years of age

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,320
they leave their natal group

35
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,600
before they immigrate into a new group

36
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
where there are no relatives to prevent in-breeding

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
So in this case you take out the young males

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,000
and they are either sent to the lab or to another breeding facility?

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, yeah

40
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,760
Out of the 1600 animals in the BPRC

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,600
on average, only 10% move into experiments per year

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,320
meaning the structure and balance of the groups are left in tact

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,120
Do you also see the monkeys that go to the lab and that are being tested on?

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,360
Yes, I see those animals too and that's very hard sometimes

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
But because I know what we are using them for

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:00:00,000
and I really feel that what we do is the right thing, I can handle that
