>> THAT WAS CHIEF WALTER BRAUN 
WITH THE SANTA FE, TEXAS SCHOOL 
POLICE BRIEFING US ON THE

SANTA FE, TEXAS.
THIS MORNING, IT HAPPENED 
SHORTLY BEFORE 8:00 LOCAL TIME 
AS HE REPORTED.
FEWER THAN TEN PEOPLE KILLED, 
AND EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HAVE BEEN 
FOUND INSIDE THE SCHOOL AND IN 
THE SURROUNDING AREA.
THE SCHOOL AT THIS POINT HAS 
BEEN CLEARED, HE SAID.
LET'S BRING IN ABC NEWS 
CONSULTANT, BRAD GARRETT, WHO IS
IN OUR WASHINGTON, D.C. BUREAU.
WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES FOUND ON THE 
CAMPUS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA, 
WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO YOU?
AT THE VERY LEAST, IT SAYS THERE
IS A DEGREE OF PREMEDITATION 
HERE.
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT 
IT, DAN.
THINK ABOUT COLUMBINE.
WEARING TRENCH COATS, THEY 
PLANTED BOMBS IN POSITIONS SO AS
THE KIDS FLED, THE EXPLOSIVES 
WOULD GO OFF.
THE GOAL FOR THEM WAS TO KILL 
VIRTUALLY EVERYONE IN THE 
SCHOOL.
FORTUNATELY, THAT DIDN'T WORK 
AND IT APPEARS TODAY ALSO, IT 
DID NOT WORK.
>> STAND BY, BRAD.
I WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW MORE 
QUESTIONS, BUT I DO WANT TO PLAY
FOR OUR VIEWERS, WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
DONALD J. TRUMP, HAD TO SAY A 
SHORT WHILE AGO.
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. 
>> UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE TO 
BEGIN BY EXPRESSING OUR SADNESS 
AND HEARTBREAK OVER THE DEADLY 
SHOOTING AT SANTA FE HIGH SCHOOL
IN TEXAS THAT JUST TOOK PLACE 
MOMENTS AGO.
WE'RE CLOSELY MONITORING THE 
SITUATION AND FEDERAL 
AUTHORITIES ARE COORDINATING 
WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON TOO LONG 
IN OUR COUNTRY.
TOO MANY YEARS, TOO MANY DECADES
NOW.
WE GRIEVE FOR THE TERRIBLE LOSS 
OF LIFE AND SEND OUR SUPPORT AND
LOVE TO EVERYONE AFFECTED BY 
THIS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC ATTACK 
TO THE STUDENTS, FAMILIES, 
TEACHERS AND PERSONNEL AT SANTA 
FE HIGH.
WE'RE WITH YOU IN THIS TRAGIC 
HOUR, AND WE WILL BE WITH YOU 
FOREVER.
MY ADMINISTRATION IS DETERMINED 
TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO
PROTECT OUR STUDENTS, SECURE OUR
SCHOOLS AND TO KEEP WEAPONS OUT 
OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO POSE A
THREAT TO THEMSELVES AND TO 
OTHERS.
EVERYONE MUST WORK TOGETHER AT 
EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT TO 
KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE.
MAY GOD HEAL THE INJURED AND MAY
GOD COMFORT THE WOUNDED AND MAY 
GOD BE WITH THE VICTIMS, AND 
WITH THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.
VERY SAD DAY.
VERY, VERY SAD.
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, DONALD J. TRUMP, 
SPEAKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE JUST
A SHORT TIME AGO ABOUT THE 
SCHOOL SHOOTING IN SANTA FE, 
TEXAS.
FEWER THAN TEN PEOPLE KILLED.
LET'S BRING IN OUR 
CORRESPONDENT, CECILIA VEGA AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSING ANGER 
AND SADNESS OVER THE LATEST 
SHOOTING SAYING THIS HAS GONE ON
TOO LONG.
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE ABOUT WHAT 
HIS POLICY PROPOSALS ARE TO 
ADDRESS THIS ONGOING PROBLEM, 
WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED A CHRONIC 
PROBLEM AND A VIRUS?
>> Reporter: DAN, HERE WE ARE 
ONCE AGAIN BY OUR COUNT, AT 
LEAST THE FIFTH TIME THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD TO 
ADDRESS THE NATION IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF A MASS SHOOTING 
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE.
WE KNOW THAT IN THE WAKE OF 
TRAGEDIES LIKE PARKLAND, HE HAS 
GONE TO THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL 
SAFETY TO ADDRESS MASS 
SHOOTINGS, TALKING PARTICULARLY 
ABOUT ARMING TEACHERS.
THAT HAS BEEN HIS BIG PUSH IN 
RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS, AND 
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, IN FACT, HE 
WAS ADDRESSING THE NATIONAL 
RIFLE ASSOCIATION AT ITS ANNUAL 
CONVENTION WHERE HE SPOKE IN 
STRONG TERMS ABOUT 
STRENGTHENING -- 
STRENGTHENING -- ARMING, EXCUSE 
ME, IF YOU WILL, TEACHERS.
HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS HE 
WOULD SAY ON HIGH SCHOOLS AND 
SCHOOL CAMPUSES.
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAYING 
THIS IS A SAD DAY.
WE'RE TOLD BY ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS THAT THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT IN
PARTICULAR, HAS BEEN IN TOUCH 
WITH THE TEXAS GOVERNOR, GREG 
ABBOTT TO OFFER HIS CONDOLENCES.
THEY ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THAT
SCENE WE ARE WATCHING UNFOLD 
BEFORE US.
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE IN CLOSE
CONTACT WITH AUTHORITIES IN 
TEXAS.
WE KNOW THAT THE ATF IS ON THE 
SCENE.
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE SAYS WE ARE
SENDING ALL RESOURCES AS NEEDED 
TO TEXAS.
AGAIN, THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO 
SAYS HE IS DETERMINED TO DO 
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO 
PROTECT STUDENTS AND ONCE AGAIN,
HE IS HERE HAVING TO ADDRESS THE
NATION IN THE WAKE OF A SCHOOL 
SHOOTING.
>> ONCE AGAIN, HERE WE ARE 
LOOKING AT THESE DISTRESSINGLY 
FAMILIAR IMAGES.
CECILIA VEGA, THANK YOU.
LET ME GET BACK TO BRAD GARRETT,
OUR CONSULTANT IN OUR WASHINGTON
BUREAU.
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE ABOUT WHETHER
ARMING TEACHERS WOULD HELP IN A 
SITUATION LIKE THIS?
>> I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA, IN 
FACT, THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES IF
YOU COLLECTIVELY LOOK AT 
STUDIES, DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD
BE ARMED.
HERE'S THE REASON, DAN.
TRAINED POLICE OFFICERS WHO KNOW
HOW TO TACTICALLY MOVE WITH A 
WEAPON WHILE OTHER WEAPONS ARE 
BEING FIRED AT THEM OR NEAR 
THEM, WE MAKE MISTAKES EVEN WITH
ALL THAT TRAINING.
YOU'RE NOW GOING TO ASK A 
TEACHER WHICH IS NOT THEIR 
PRIMARY JOB, TO PROTECT THE 
SCHOOL, TO NOW TAKE OUT A 
WEAPON.
PERHAPS FACING SOMEBODY WITH A 
LONG GUN, AND TH AR-15.
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA AND THEY 
COULD INADVERTENTLY SHOOT 
SOMEBODY ELSE OR THEMSELVES.
THIS HAS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH, 
AND MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAID, 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT.
>> THIS IS A COMPLEX AND 
EMOTIONAL ISSUE, AND I SUSPECT 
AFTER THIS LATEST SHOOTING, WE 
WILL SEE THE ISSUE ENGAGE, THE 
DEBATE ENGAGED YET AGAIN.
BRAD GARRETT AND CECILIA VEGA, 
THANK YOU BOTH.
JUST TO QUICKLY RECAP HERE 
AGAIN.
THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER SCHOOL 
SHOOTING IN SANTA FE, TEXAS.
FEWER THAN TEN PEOPLE KILLED, 
AND IT COULD BE AROUND EIGHT.
EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN FOUND 
ACCORDING TO POLICE ON THE 
CAMPUS AND IN THE SURROUNDING 
AREA.
THE SCHOOL AT THIS POINT HAS 
BEEN CLEAR.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO COVER THIS 
STORY RIGHT HERE ON ABC NEWS 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON 
ABCNEWS.COM AND ON ABC RADIO.
WE'LL BE BACK ON THE AIR WITH 
ANOTHER SPECIAL REPORT IN A FEW 
HOURS LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHEN 
THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS AND OTHER 
OFFICIALS BRING US THE LATEST 
UPDATES.
FOR NOW, I'M DAN HARRIS IN NEW 
YORK.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
 HAS BEE 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
