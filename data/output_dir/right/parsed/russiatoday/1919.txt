militarily I don't like to say where I'm
going and what I'm doing
Russia vows to shoot down any and all
missiles fired at Syria
get ready Russia because they'll be
coming nice and new and smart
president Trump tells the Kremlin to get
ready for Syrian missiles a military
strike against Syria is on a hot boil at
the White House now he's put himself in
the trap where he's got to deliver on
something he has to deliver on his tough
talk
this is sending the sort of message that
clearly is alerting all those forces in
Syria a war declaration over Twitter the
perfect example of impeccable diplomacy
guys submitted there guy
our relationship with Russia is worse
now than it has ever been and that
includes the cold war there is no reason
for this stop the arms race then stop
the arms race you Muppet can someone put
him in a diaper and spank him until he
calms down much of the bad blood with
Russia is caused by the fake and corrupt
Russia investigation headed up by the
all Democrat loyalists or people that
work
you just threatened to start a war with
Russia like 20 minutes ago and now
you're blaming the bad blood with Russia
on the Democrats
