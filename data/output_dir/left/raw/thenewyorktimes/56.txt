1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,859
“My name’s Corin Hardy.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,150
I’m the director of "The Nun."

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,200
So I’m going to tell you a
little bit about this scene,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,210
which takes place about
a third of the way

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,890
into the movie.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,110
Father Burke, played
by Demián Bichir,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,079
has just been woken up in the
dead of night while staying

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,700
in a convent.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,880
And he’s woken by the sound
of a child’s footsteps,

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
which he follows into
the cemetery outside

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,970
to discover
something which has

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,685
haunted his past in the
form of a boy called Daniel.

13
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:35,240
Now the evil
forces are messing

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,425
with the minds of our
characters, playing tricks.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,960
So they want to
dispatch Burke.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,760
And he ends up in this coffin.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,200
This was a single shot on
a crane, which we performed

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,380
the first half of of the
fall up to the gravestone,

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,900
and then with a
vision effects join,

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,370
performed the
second part of it.

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,110
So it appears that
he’s buried alive.

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,100
Now he’s able to ring a bell
to alert Sister Irene, played

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,729
by Taissa Farmiga.

24
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,630
This concept’s based
on a real concept.

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,420
During the plague, if
someone was buried alive,

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,060
they would be able
to have a bell

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,120
to ring to alert people
that they were still alive

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,720
underground.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,310
Pretty creepy.

30
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,680
So she’s come out to try
and find where he is.

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,380
And now the second part of the
supernatural forces messing

32
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,430
with our characters comes when
she hears a number of bells

33
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,870
and can’t determine
which grave he’s in.

34
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,380
But she has holy
super power, and is

35
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,800
able to use her visions
and tune into the bells

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,520
to find which coffin
Burke is buried in.

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,290
I wanted to use this scene
to maximize and amplify

38
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,590
the tension around the
concept of being buried alive

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,290
in a coffin.

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,720
So first of all, this idea
of claustrophobia, and not

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,550
being able to be found.

42
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,760
But I thought it
could be even more

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,950
terrifying if
there was something

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,970
in the coffin with you.

45
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,340
So Burke is trying
to find out what

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,890
is down there whilst Irene is
trying to get to him in time.

47
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,740
I wanted to time this
scare to find out

48
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,790
what’s in the coffin
with him just right."

49
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,990
[sighing]

50
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,790
[grunting]

51
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,890
"(SCREAMING) Irene!"

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,790
[bell ringing]

53
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,590
[grunting]

54
00:02:33,590 --> 00:00:00,000
[screaming]
