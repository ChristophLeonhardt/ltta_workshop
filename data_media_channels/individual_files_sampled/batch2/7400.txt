something really interesting I don't know if a lot of you follow Paul Ryan on Twitter but you should for the last several days he has been tweeting incessantly about the need for tax reform after all according to what Paul Ryan's telling us every day on social media tax reform is the only way to save the US economy tax reform is the only way to create jobs tax reform is the only path forward for a sustainable US economy for the United States of America according to Paul Ryan now it's important to understand that when Paul Ryan says tax reform what he means is tax breaks for the top 1% because as we all know from the Republican tax plan from the Donald Trump budget from the health care bill the bottom 99% get absolutely nothing from any of the tax reform that has been proposed by any Republican sitting in Washington DC so Paul Ryan is out there telling us in coded language to try to trick voters that tax reform giving money to the wealthy is going to save the economy and create jobs oh thank god right that's what we need unfortunately for idiot Ryan we've been trying that since the 1980s and not one single time that has ever been attempted has it ever worked Paul Ryan is not stupid let me point that out a lot of people think he is Paul Ryan is not a stupid person on the contrary Paul Ryan thinks you're stupid Paul Ryan the House Speaker thinks you don't understand history thinks you don't understand that trickle-down economics has been an absolute failure every single time it has been attempted there's not a single instance of trickle-down economics ever working in practice not one meanwhile you know what has worked you know what is helping an economy creating jobs and helping the underclass and inadvertently helping businesses to take a look at see adil new report came out today that Seattle's minimum wage hike the largest in the country it's going to hit fifteen dollars by the year 2021 has not lost the city any jobs now that was the big fear that's what Republicans told us right if we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour unemployment is going to skyrocket businesses are going to shut down there's going to be joblessness there's going to be economic apocalypse if we enact these $15 minimum wage well Seattle said to hell with you we're going to do it anyway and things are better than ever according to the new reports people who working minimum-wage jobs but also getting health care coverage from their employer are now making $12 an hour those working minimum-wage jobs that do not get health insurance through their employer are making $15 an hour and people aren't losing jobs in fact according to the report some places some restaurants are struggling to find enough people to come in and work that's how busy they are now and you know why because people have more money the people who actually spend 100% of their paycheck because they have to they have more money to spend and so they do spend it they're buying food they're buying appliances they're renting apartments they're buying cars finally because they can finally afford it because we're giving money to the 99% instead of the top 1% so don't listen to this BS Paul Ryan is spewing every day trickle-down economics does not work tax reform as he calls it does not work the only thing that works and we have proof of it is giving more money to low-income workers and that is the best way to stimulate an economy
