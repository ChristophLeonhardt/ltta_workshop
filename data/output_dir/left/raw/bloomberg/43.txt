1
00:00:01,396 --> 00:00:04,280
(bells chiming)

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,500
Just imagine living

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,763
in this 15 million dollar home.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,540
You're paid a steady salary,

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,770
supported by a whole team of staff

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,980
whose sole purpose is to get
you to play at your best.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,200
Alright fellas, let's go.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,120
And if you don't perform,

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,420
you're cut from the team.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,850
Here we go, round three, round three.

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,530
Keep it going, no breaks.

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,180
If you think this sounds like the life

13
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,193
of a pro athlete, you'd be right, kind of.

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,300
Stop your bitchin'.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,120
It's the life of the sports player

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,203
of the future, lived
by the lucky few today.

17
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,740
(fun electronic music)

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,040
As technology replaces old jobs,

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,400
it's also creating new ones.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,650
I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,923
the jobs of the future.

22
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:55,923
(fun, upbeat music)

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,553
My name is Michael Schmale,
I'm a professional gamer.

24
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:04,053
(guns firing)

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,080
For someone who's uneducated
in the e-sports scene

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,190
and doesn't understand how it works,

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,380
the way I would describe
it is, it's kind of similar

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,220
to a professional athlete.

29
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,659
It's a lot of preparation,
hard work, and team effort.

30
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:23,492
I think one guy's above me.

31
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,163
Nah, trust me, he's not.

32
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,320
Ghost Gaming pays players like Mike

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,403
to compete in video game battles.

34
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,737
And yes, that is a real job now.

35
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:36,560
(guns firing)

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,000
More people watch video
games than Netflix,

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,270
Hulu, ESPN, and HBO put together.

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,603
And e-sports is already a
billion dollar industry.

39
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:50,130
(upbeat, energetic music)

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,140
That's how Ghost can
afford to shower players

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,520
with all kinds of perks,
like this team house.

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,690
It's a ten bed, 16 bath
mansion overlooking Hollywood.

43
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,050
And it houses 10 players at a time,

44
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,630
all in their late teens and early 20s.

45
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,330
So when most people just take a quick look

46
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,150
at the house we're living in,
it's a bunch of teenagers,

47
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,190
and it's a lot of us, so you would think

48
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,950
it's rowdy, we're just reckless,

49
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,129
but we're professional e-sports players.

50
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,720
(loud alarm ringing)

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,070
Here's the day of a professional gamer.

52
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:28,520
(fun, playful music)

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,160
I wake up nine, 9:30, breakfast.

54
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,940
Chest up, chest up, let's go.

55
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,360
11 a.m., we have workouts.

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,030
That lasts for an hour
to an hour and a half.

57
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,863
There you go Mike,

58
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,400
push it straight into the ground.

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,103
Eight, nine and ten.

60
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,140
After we do that,

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,780
we hit the film session, and we watch film

62
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,930
on other teams to see what they do.

63
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,680
Just taking his time, make
sure you guys take your time,

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,100
you don't need to be fancy with it,

65
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,190
just need to make sure to hit the shots

66
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,023
you need to hit.

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Oh man, after lunch, we
play from 1:30 to 7:30.

68
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,146
(upbeat, energetic music)

69
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,542
(guns firing)

70
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,230
One's gonna be, ladder,
ladder, ladder, problem.

71
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,063
Bomb is really one shot.

72
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,113
Oh my god, push that, one got pushed up.

73
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,020
And that's just a long grind

74
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,223
of playing against other talented teams.

75
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,050
(gasping)

76
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,410
Good job.

77
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,600
We play from lunch to dinner.

78
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,140
We have a wild lobster with chive butter.

79
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,124
I put it on Twitter.

80
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,090
(playful, fun music)

81
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,923
How you doin', Mike?

82
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,233
It's amazing.

83
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,820
(slow, entrancing guitars)

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,080
Mike's been playing video
games since he was five,

85
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,880
but when his parents got divorced,

86
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,340
that's when he really
buckled down on gaming.

87
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,460
I would just get in my
desk, turn my game on.

88
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,860
It's like I would disappear

89
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,460
and go into another world
and forget about all that.

90
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,050
When he was 13, Mike
qualified in the pro-league

91
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,723
of the popular video game, Call of Duty.

92
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,520
He became the youngest
professional player in the game.

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,450
When I first walked into the event,

94
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,850
I was just amazed and
just fell in love with it.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,702
That's when I knew this
is what I wanted to do.

96
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:18,990
(slow, entrancing guitars)

97
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,019
That conversation with his parents,

98
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,970
telling them he was pursuing a career

99
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,170
as a professional video gamer, well,

100
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,330
imagine your kid telling you that.

101
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,163
There was a lot of
arguments and late nights.

102
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,030
But Mike promised to put school first,

103
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,370
and his parents eventually came around.

104
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,900
Well, as a single parent, it wasn't easy.

105
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,613
In my mind, I really couldn't
foresee it as a career,

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,220
but we were at the mall
and some young boy came up

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,140
to Mike and he said, "Excuse
me, are you SpaceLy?"

108
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,900
And Mike said, "Yeah," he goes,
"Can I have your autograph?"

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,150
And I started to cry, and
I'm like, "This is crazy."

110
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,610
I'm like, "He recognized you, Mike?"

111
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,160
And that was instrumental for me, as well,

112
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,220
realizing how this has taken off.

113
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,670
I started earning money
at these tournaments

114
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,480
after my third local event.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,060
That was like one of
the best feelings ever,

116
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,927
being able to go home and
like, "Look, Mom, look, Dad.

117
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,610
"Today I got paid for playing."

118
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,870
I wasn't just wasting my time,

119
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,610
and I wasn't just making
up stories and fairytales

120
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,510
just so I could play video games more.

121
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,110
Mike didn't wanna discuss his contract,

122
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,630
but when he joined Ghost,
it was reported that he

123
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,470
and his teammates shared a
50,000 dollar signing bonus

124
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,410
and were each offered a
4,000 dollar months' salary.

125
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,020
On top of all that, Mike
also earns money on the side.

126
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,160
Fans pay to watch him play on
the popular streaming site,

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,136
Twitch, and he also sells
his own line of apparel.

128
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:54,220
(fun, victorious music)

129
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,050
That all makes for a pretty
good living by the standards

130
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,070
of any 20 year old, but it's even better

131
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,870
when you consider that
almost all of his expenses,

132
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,460
from his rent to his food to his training

133
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,970
to his gaming related
travel, is all paid for,

134
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,470
which leaves a lot of room for shopping.

135
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,420
Can I take them off?

136
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,520
Sure.

137
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,597
Alright, we got the Yeezys, moon rocks.

138
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:19,840
I've been a fan of shoes
forever, so there's

139
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,590
a lot of times where I spend

140
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,340
an insane amount of money on shoes.

141
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:28,080
(chill pop music)

142
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,750
But like professional
sports, gaming is not

143
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,900
a life long career, and
there's a ton of turnover too.

144
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,640
Three months after I met
Mike, Ghost dropped him

145
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,630
from the team, and he's now
back home in New Jersey.

146
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,870
This sounds very tragic
and could nearly end

147
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,580
a player's career, but this is

148
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,820
a very common thing in the scene.

149
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,960
And players get released and
switched around all the time.

150
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,070
My advice to young gamers that
wanna play professionally,

151
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,520
you gotta stay patient,
you gotta stay dedicated

152
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
and understand that it's
gonna take sacrifice

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,910
because there's always
another person out there

154
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,950
trying to take that spot.

155
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,720
But I don't have any plans
to give up the gaming career.

156
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm gonna bounce back from this

157
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,611
and make my mom and dad proud.

158
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,444
(chill pop music)

159
00:07:16,279 --> 00:00:00,000
(mysterious synths)
