00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,090
Hey YouTube World! It's me, Evelyn. An interesting
thing happened to me a couple weeks ago. I

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,720
was minding my own business, checking my email...

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,100
[Dream Sequence]

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,100
I got an email from Best Lace Wigs. They wanted
to see if I was interested in doing a wig

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,850
review.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,250
[silence]

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:31,000
Me. Who has never done a wig or weave review
in any of my 300 some odd videos on YouTube

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,140
- me - THAT me?!!?

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,870
So of course I said yes.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:41,870
So this is the unit. The name of the wig is
nothing special. It's Indian Remy Bodywave

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,170
SW081.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,170
The color is 1B. It's 20 inches long, under
the boob length. And the cap size is Medium/Large.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,520
I'll put all that information in the video
description box below.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,780
The problem is,

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,780
I don't actually know how to wear a lace front
wig. So...

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's watch.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,700
He doesn't like it. What does he know. I'm
fresher than youUUuuuu. Fresher than you -- OOP!

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,459
Okay, so this is the hair not combed out.
This is what it looks like on fresh out the

19
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:44,459
box, stop look and watch - ready yet, get
set, I'm all that!

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,599
This hairline is interesting. I don't know
how to cut the lace properly. I'm going to

21
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:59,599
watch YouTube videos and see how to do this
because... first of all, I'm more of a side

22
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,869
part girl anyway, so...

23
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:06,919
My mom asked me why they would send me a wig.

24
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,729
[pause]

25
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,149
Mom: Yeah, why?

26
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,790
Um, wig update. Doesn't make sense, but um..

27
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,790
I have completely brushed it out. I look completely
different. So now it's like - kinda wavy.

28
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:30,819
And that's what I saw on the picture when
I requested the wig. It look like a wet and wavy look. 

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,450
So I'm going to make a proper review
of this wig, ha!!

30
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:44,700
Which leads us to present day. I've worn this
wig in public - in all seriousness - once.

31
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,480
Girl, I'm cuter than you! I'm cuter than you!

32
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,150
Doyin: No! No. No!

33
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,920
Oh my god, unfriendly black hotties, oh my
god!

34
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,209
Granted, I wore a beanie over it because [points
to scalp]

35
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,140
As a lace front novice, here is my review.

36
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,000
So I have four categories that I'm going to
review this wig under...through...what?

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,500
Number 1: PRICE.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,900
As of right now, today, the day I'm filming
this wig, this unit is $106. [screams internally]

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,340
Y'all really be out here doing this? I've
watched tons of wig and weave reviews and

40
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,519
I don't know if $106 is customary. I also
don't know what Remy means, and this is Remy.

41
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,499
It's human hair - I don't know where it's
from - and it is Remy. $106. 20 inches. Do

42
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:41,260
with that information what you will.

43
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,400
Category number 2: The Hairline.

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Look at me. Can you see me?! Can you see me?
I'm new to this, you feel what I'm saying,

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,680
and I did cut the lace off, BUT, the only
way this can match my hairline is if I also

46
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,950
cut into the wig.

47
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,900
I'm one of those people who has a dippy hairline.
My hairline is actually underneath and to

48
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,900
the back. And I don't really know if you are
supposed to actually cut the wig, like, hair

49
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,439
would come out.

50
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,750
So I didn't, and uh, here we are today. Lookin'
like this. If I wore this with a snapback,

51
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,389
or like a "beantie" or something, it might
be fine.

52
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:30,889
It's also not very secure -- oop! It does
have combs. I don't know why this didn't click

53
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:31,479
before:

54
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:37,300
Oh yeah, people's edges get snatched because
they adhere the wig to their head in some

55
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,930
fashion. But not I, sayeth the Lord!

56
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,650
I'm sure some of you watching this, or some
of your favorite beauty gurus can make this

57
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,389
hairline work, but we're not talking about
your favorite beauty gurus, we're talking

58
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,750
about me. You wanted this, Best Lace Wigs.
You asked for me.

59
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,009
So this is whatchu gon' get.

60
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:58,900
Alright, so I talked about price, talked about
hairline, and now number three I'm talking

61
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,449
about Hair Texture.

62
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:06,879
W  hen I went on the Best Lace Wigs website
to select this wig, um, I was using pictures

63
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,900
as my guide. They had pictures on the mannequin,
and they also had pictures that looked like

64
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,800
they was taken from Instagram...?

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,610
But in retrospect, I should have chosen a
texture - I should have chosen Yaki.

66
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,610
Even with the freshest of Korean relaxers.
Of Dominican blowouts, this would never be

67
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,610
me. And it also makes it difficult because
I'm not about to be out here hot combing or

68
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,349
flat ironing my edges.

69
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:36,259
So that it can blend.

70
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:46,200
As for the curl pattern, I would say this
is a strong 2B. I call it my wet n' wavy look.

71
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,330
This hair texture is easy to detangle. Comparing
it though to my hair so, I feel like anything

72
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,680
would be easy to detangle.

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
It doesn't shed that much, see, I didn't,
there's nothing actually that I'm doing. It

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,819
does get clumpy and stringy as you can see.

75
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,169
It also does get frizzy up at the top. I've
never had to deal with like, flyaways, you

76
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,060
know what I'm saying, because my entire head
is a flyaway.

77
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,690
It's really annoying! Like I get you, Becky!
Like, I get it! These are really annoying,

78
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,400
these little wispity wisps!

79
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,080
We talked about price, hairline, hair texture,
and the fourth and final category that I'm

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,080
going to use to review this lace front wig
from Best Lace Wigs, um, is Hair Density.

81
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:38,629
I can actually see the netting or the cap.
Once it gets to the back and you know, the

82
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,150
hair starts to hang down, it feels thick,
but um, up here at the top...

83
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:51,150
You literally just have to glance at my head
and you can see the brown netting of the wig.

84
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:57,800
So overall, I had fun playing with this wig.
Ummmmm

85
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I was actually amazed at just how much I was
feeling myself even with a jacked hairline,

86
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,310
even with a raggedy hairline.

87
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,780
I wasn't friends with Doyin anymore, you know
what I'm saying, no one could tell me anything,

88
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,449
you know what I'm saying, I'm magically Habesha
now.

89
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:21,700
So I can only imagine how out of this world
disrespectful I would be if I had a professionally

90
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,860
done situation on my head.

91
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,050
I am interested in wearing afro-ish type weaves and
wigs. If I could be a 3C, you know what I'm

92
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,800
saying, I would have no problems, you know
what I'm saying, I not gon' stop you you know

93
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,689
what I mean...

94
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:41,169
While I'm interested in the aesthetics um
that these sorts of options can provide, I'm

95
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,439
also not interested in making it happen for
myself.

96
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,700
So I might have to find like an Ursula Stephens
you know what I'm saying, or YouTube! 

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,240
If a Jouelzy, you know what I mean, peakmill, thomasadrianna..

98
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,590
If ChicNatural, if TheChicNatural could holla
and minister unto my scalp, I would have no

99
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,009
qualms! I would do it in a heartbeat!

100
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,610
Shout out to Best Lace Wigs for making this
video possible for your viewing pleasure.

101
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,889
Thank you Best Lace Wigs for stepping out
on faith because I don't know what you thought

102
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,169
this was gonna be, but here it is.

103
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:16,199
And thank you out there for watching.

104
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,150
In the comments below, tell me who your favorite
YouTuber beauty gurus who do wig and weave

105
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,490
reviews, tell me who your favorites are.

106
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,409
And hopefully I can turn the comments section
into a magical black girl lovefest showcase

107
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:33,669
resource um for anybody who clicked on this
video, and thought they was gon' get something

108
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,059
and got something else.

109
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,579
And I will see you on the internet somewhere.

110
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,830
Bye!

111
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,710
So the way I cleanse my hair, is I wet it.
And then I put shampoo in my hand, and then

112
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,810
I put it on my hair.

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Blooper: You know I hate when people look
- are off to the side of the camera, so I'm going to do that.

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[My little brother behind the camera busts
out laughing]
