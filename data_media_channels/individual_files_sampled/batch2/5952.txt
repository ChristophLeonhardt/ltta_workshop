well we have new devastating polls on President Trump released today that show the president getting what one poll says is his lowest grade for honesty since he was elected with 60% of the country saying he is not honest and he and an even larger group 65% of the country saying he is not level-headed and that is the essential picture of the president that emerges in Bob Woodward's new book that he is not honest and he is not level-headed and that is the same picture that emerged in the anonymous op-ed piece published in the New York Times last week by a senior official in the Trump administration saying that quote many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while affording mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office a Quinnipiac poll done this weekend asked for a verdict from the public on that New York Times op-ed piece with this question as you may know there have been anonymously published allegations that senior advisors to President Trump work behind his back to stop him from making what these advisors believe are bad decisions do you believe these allegations are true or not 55% believed that the president's staff worked behind his back to stop him from making bad decisions only 28% do not believe that and 17% are not sure so only 28% of Americans believe Donald Trump is in control of his presidency 28% and that poll was being taken this weekend in reaction to the recent revelations about the Trump administration when that poll is being taken Mike Pence brought the vice presidency to a new love do you think you know who anonymous is I don't I don't know but I do know that they should resign and leave this administration should all top officials take a lie-detector test and would you agree to take one I would agree to take it in a heartbeat and there Mike Pence took his place in history as the first vice president to volunteer to take a lie-detector test and he did it because he lives in fear of Donald Trump a man who mike pence knows and who we all know would never take a lie-detector test about anything and as Donald Trump has destroyed any pretense of the dignity of the presidency Mike Pence has done the same for whatever remains left of the perceived dignity of the vice presidency after Republican vice president Spiro Agnew plea-bargained his conviction for tax evasion while vie while the vice president while he was vice president in order to avoid charges of bribery and he resigned the vice presidency in a deal that allowed him to escape prison time and it is at times like these when vice president pence knows that he can hope to escape history's verdict as our worst vice president thanks entirely to Spiro Agnew Mike Pence would take a lie-detector test in a heartbeat why because the president won't believe him if he doesn't take a polygraph test so what does he think the president can fire him Mike Pence is one of two people in the Trump administration who was elected to his job and he's the only person in the Trump administration who has repeatedly used the fourteenth century word lodestone meaning a star that leads the way or guides our way the anonymous op-ed piece said Senator John McCain should be our lodestar quote we may no longer have Senator McCain but we will always have his example a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue mr. Trump may fear such honorable men but we should revere them one of the more unusual words in the essay is lodestar which it turns out people have looked is a word that you have used many times sure must again be our lodestar with vigilance and resolve as our lodestar it really was the lodestar do you think someone purposely put that in the essay to try to set you up yeah I wouldn't know I wouldn't know he knows he knows that if he is not the author of the anonymous op-ed piece then yes the author was definitely trying to set him up by using the Mike Pence word loadstar and that would mean that the resistance to Trump inside the Trump White House is as disgusted with Mike Pence as with Donald Trump if you disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing as president as so many of Bob Woodward's Trump administration sources do and as the anonymous author of the New York Times op-ed piece obviously does then you are part of an overwhelming American majority a Quinnipiac poll shows Donald Trump's job approval at 38% with 54% disapproving and a new CNN poll tonight shows only a 36 percent approval and a 58 percent disapproval but the most important number in the polls is the one that shows a majority agreement with the anonymous author of the up ed piece and with the Trump administration sources in Bob Woodward's book that Donald Trump is not fit to serve as president 55% of America say the president is not fit to serve as president thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
