Tikrit, Iraq
April 1, 2015
Iraq’s Defense Minister announces that security
forces have retaken Tikrit from ISIS.
The city had been under ISIS control since
June 2014.
Remaining ISIS militants are said to be scattered
around the city.
This is the first major loss for ISIS since
their defeat in Kobani, Syria.
But ISIS still controls Iraq’s second largest
city of Mosul and the Anbar provinces.
