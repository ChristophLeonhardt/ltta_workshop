I will point out that the total absence of humor now it's not just the former comedians not just Netflix the chief Metro political correspondent for the New York Times Shane Gould mocker he watched this interview by Allie Stuckey friend of the show Allie Stuckey this mock satirical interview where she pretends to interview Ocasio Cortez and it's kind of funny he responds in the perfect leftist way here is that interview Alexandria thanks for being here thank you thank you for having me do you have any experience that qualifies you for this job I was growing up during the Clinton era and then basically when I was in middle school 9/11 happened do you have any knowledge whatsoever about how our political system works mmm yes it's really good it goes on it's worth watching the whole thing but look she's obviously on a different set she's got a different background she's worried different clothing than the interviewer in the interview without Cassio Cortez and that interview clip between the Hoover Institution or I'm sorry Margaret Hoover and occasion Cortez went viral everybody saw it right and so Allie who does satire is doing a little satire video and it was very funny this is how the New York Times chief political correspondent responded he said Shane Shane gold maker gold mocker this faked interview of Ocasio by CR TV has nearly a million views on Facebook in less than 24 hours interview didn't happen it takes clips from Margaret Hoover's show and edits info questions not labeled satire other than the winky emoji that labels it satire get this man up you litt sir this guy this is the kind of breaking journalists incredible work that we can expect from the New York Times are you kidding me oh my god first of all it's obvious satire second of all by a well-known satirist then it has a little winky emoji on it alerting you that is obviously satire and for a clip that everybody has seen and the left they said wait a second this isn't real because they don't they don't understand they don't understand their opposition they don't understand the world so they think that if at first of all if a conservative does something it can never be sad tired because conservatives don't do comedy they don't know they can't be funny they don't joke around they know they're like mean all right racist David dukes they can't do that right that's what they that's what they think and so he's alerting people he said this is fake and then all the lefties if you look in the little Twitter thread they say I tried to report it yeah I tried to report it do what doctor do you say fellas fellas there's it's something called humor it's called comedy life isn't so bad it's it's okay sometimes it's okay you can laugh a little it's all right you're not gonna you it won't prevent you from being an ally to laugh a little it's okay you can no you can that's okay you could still be a good person and laugh every so often a really really bizarre I mean this guy's in New York Times writer who knows I mean who knows where this goes for the left I can't imagine they'll go this way forever it's so unfunny
