00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,570
days because i'm filming a skit that

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,600
will require me to wear a mustache

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,350
so stay tuned for that I didn't tell you

30
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,130
about the skit yet it's a skid I can't

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,010
say much because it's a big secret but

32
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,340
it actually has to do with thumb with me

33
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,850
wearing a mustache why don't you just

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,960

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,420
a song or just little snippet of the

42
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,920
song somewhere and you want to know what

43
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,100
song it is what would you do I would

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,560
search up everywhere that I heard can't

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,450
keep my hands to myself and then that's

46
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:25,990
it

47
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,150
what would you do I probably search up

48
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,280
hands to myself or can't keep my hands

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,200
to myself just clocking my day there was

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,660
a search engine called dogpile and it

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,730
used to aggregate all of the search

52
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,670
engines and you just type in can keep is

53
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,070
to myself and dogpile would be searching

54
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,680
for all the different search engines and

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,450
give you all the results that was before

56
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,360

my office we are watching harry potter

163
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,340
we made this promise a while ago because

164
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,000
we we never watched any Harry Potter's

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,890
we didn't read any of the books and

166
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,160
compare it i decided to fly every single

167
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,950
harry potter movie that was made we did

168
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,680
a heads-up challenge a while back and

169
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,290
one of the characters were the various

170
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,960
snape we had no idea through the woods

171
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,510
and we got a lot of unless they read

172
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,130
negative comments about the fact that

173
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,050
we've never seen any of the harry potter

174
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,550
flakes that no I'm going to have no idea

175
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,350
what

176
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,900
so we felt we felt kind of bad and we

177
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,610
want to give it a shot and we love it

178
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,870
and we're number three right now

179
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,130
prisoner of azkaban we're gonna watch

180
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,410
that we keep watching them all really

181
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,800
like it's better if we do do it and we

182
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,360
have a great spot for the movie so we

183
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,070
have no excuses monkeys

184
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,060
so we're going to continue to watch

185
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,240
harry potter and that's it can you take

186
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,590
