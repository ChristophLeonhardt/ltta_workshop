on my face book store mm-hmm though on

6
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,010
my head I've got one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font>

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,529
scoffs from the new stock which is a

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,180
sort of dusty yellow dark purple zebra

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,690
print<font color="#E5E5E5"> stripy hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jett come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it um</font>

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,520
it's pretty decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> size gives you just</font>

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">about enough coverage and if it doesn't</font>

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,570
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you enough coverage then you know</font>

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,730

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,290
then I paired it with this purple blazer

15
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,710
which was actually a charity shop find

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,480
from Butte that my grandmother and my

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,060
sister found<font color="#CCCCCC"> imbued i was only six</font>

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,160
pounds and I think it's austin and i

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,540
think it's all their vintage as really

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,190
nice I don't even think has been warned

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,879
even if it has six pound so i'll just

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,600
show you the blazer it's very long well

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,810
not very long it's quite badi you can

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,810
wear it open cleansed think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna</font>

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,860
wear open sleeves rolled up I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,420
like a big winter scarf round my neck

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,370
later as well then oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then</font>

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,160
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> my usual jewelry from Donald us</font>

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,400

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,690

32
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,500

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,590
forever 21<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jersey tube skirt so my</font>

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,420
makeup quite bare because I'm getting

35
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,310
really lazy and I just can't be bothered

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,140
wearing mascara eyeliner because it

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,479
takes ages to wipe off<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you want to</font>

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,950
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bed but this would probably only</font>

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,670
I've got a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark purple lipstick</font>

44
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,130
from Mac which I've mixed with like a

45
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,190
nude lipstick from miss sporty or

46
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,990
something rubbish like that so that's

47
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,250

48
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,740
