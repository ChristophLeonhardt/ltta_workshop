Steve Bannon has accused Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell of being swamp monsters my dear friend of the first female physician ever elected to Congress dr. nanhee worth will join the will join our show to discuss the swamp congressional gridlock in the wealth of nations then Emily Butler and Jacob berry will join the panel of deplorable 'z to talk about the biggest mistake in modern political history Pope Francis's implied admonition that pro-lifers must support daca and Miss America's opinion on Russian collusion I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show and before we do any of that we have a sponsor marshal we got a sponsor some we finally did it this is great we're gonna possibly be able to keep the lights on on more than just selling leftist tears Tumblr's so this and I'm real this was Providence this was the perfect first sponsor for our show we talk all the time on the show about how nobody knows anything about history that's why all the hysterical people on the Left are talking of their Trump to Hitler or the Third Reich or fall of Rome it's because no one ever knows anything about history other than the fall of Rome and the Third Reich well luckily there is a great new podcast I I really like this podcast I've listened to it so far you've got to go check out the first episode it's called tides of history it's a new podcast from wonder II and the podcast is from PhD historian Patrick Wyman who happens also to be an MMA analyst and he answers all of the these two periods that constructed our modern world antiquity so the Classical era the fall of Rome and the beginning of modernity 1350 to 1650 the period where we see the West building on all that we have from classical antiquity and creating the modern world creating nation-states where does capitalism come from why did all of these governments organize in roughly the same way around roughly the same period what why do we have States to begin with how did modern trade routes get started how did globalization start what periods of globalization have already happened we're seeing a new period happening now but when they happened before and why and what happens when you privatize militaries sounds spooky you'll have to listen to find out all of these questions can be traced back to the period of time during the Renaissance and just before the Enlightenment so what Patrick does it's so good he takes what could be really dry history I remember I was a history major and you always hear that history is just one fact after another he takes what could be really dry boring history and he weaves it into really engaging narratives I listened to it when I'm driving and it's a great way it's really hard to take the time to read books you know I only get an hour to to read a day but I Drive a lot I'm in Los Angeles if you commute you can listen to it and it's just like injecting your brain with history knowledge and so not only can you impress people at cocktail parties but you'll also be able to understand your own civilization your own moment in politics it will make you realize that perhaps not everything is falling apart or if it is all falling apart why is it and where are the historical backgrounds for that so what you should do is you got a google it right now tides of history go and google it it's on Apple podcasts and Google Play it's on stitcher all those all the podcast sites so look it up right now tides of history it's with Patrick Wyman I think you're really gonna like it and tweet me and let me know what you think about it because I've really enjoyed listening to it so far and go over there so we can keep these lights on come on guys okay we had some explosive political news over the weekend and that was Steve bannon's interview with Charlie Rose on 60 minutes the main question I had after watching this interview you can watch the whole thing it's about an hour long is how Charlie Rose got his job he just comes off so poorly and uninformed and like a left-wing hack but this is CBS news so perhaps it was ever thus to comment on the swamp I bring on now I have the great privilege of bringing on my friend a very long time the first female physician ever elected to Congress she represented New York's 19th congressional district until we got gerrymandered out and a few extra cities were added in my friend dr. nan Hayworth nan thank you sir and I I was able to win that election for the sake of the people we think so much about thanks to you know you were an incredibly potent force for us and everybody who knows you is not surprised to hear that so thank you thank you nan and someday on the show maybe I'll start telling some stories about all the lawsuit lawsuit threats and the ex rock star isn't that came out of that campaign because it was the most fun thing in the history of politics you are too humbled in we must get into the politics of what Bannon is talking about here he is accusing DC of being an institutional place he's saying the office of the speaker is an institution office of the lead excuse me the office of the leader is an institution there are forces like lobbyists and think tanks and donors and this and that and this then the other thing that are controlling Washington DC now you were elected on a tea party wave you represented a very important district you were on the Financial Services Committee you were I believe a deputy whip you helped it was one of the pressing whips yeah one of the freshmen whips is he right are these guys the swamp monsters and if not where is the swamp how do we drain him well Michael in some ways the swamp is in a sense the swamp is ourselves I'll accept you from that company but no you make a great point it's if we are not the one of the many lessons I learned when I was in Congress was that we look to our elected to change things but they will not be able to change anything unless they have the support of their constituents and most of these especially I'm the long-term public servants quite honestly ourselves those who should be public service long-term electeds are there because they have managed to satisfy their constituents so if we want really to change we have to look to ourselves as Americans and say we have to understand what we ask all these people to do when we send them to Washington we have to understand the framers brilliant design for the federal government the limitations of the federal government and how far we have exceeded them unless we do that we are not gonna get change for the better and we're not gonna get change that makes the people who are seeking change happy with what happens you're making an obvious point that nobody in this populist climate will make which is that we are the swamp monster David Mayhew became a famed political scientist for making the incredible observation that members of Congress are primarily motivated by reelection and they will do what their constituents tell them to do with what their constituents ask them to do and then their constituents will complain when they do it depending on what happens that's right look if their constituents to understand per se when they say we need to cut budgets and they then understand that when you know when we say that that means we're going to have to cut some things that you like then we could have a rational conversation about these things but most of the time that's not what's happening everybody wants somebody else's ox to be gored right exactly right that's that's a big part of the problem I have and that's not to say by the way that I have enormous sympathy for the predicament if you will in which Senator McConnell in particular finds himself I am actually quite angry that he doesn't move to do the one thing that the president has urged so strongly that I think has to be done if we are actually to pass a legislative package a legislative agenda that achieves something approaching the populist goals that the president espoused and that is to put more Americans back to work to make it possible for employers and businesses and small businesses to work better to reduce the cost of labor in this country and that means and the president's made some progress with that as much they can make from the executive branch in reducing regulations and he has done some things for which he deserves praise but that's not gonna happen unless they break the filibuster we're not gonna get that package of reforms I totally agree we have to break it I don't dislike the idea of a filibuster but the way that it's been abused by Democrats for so long and the way that the government has been abused by Democrats it seems to me a a natural step and it's surprising that McConnell won't do it well they like their prerogative and they worry about being in the minority again and that's what looms over their heads no senator wants to give up a filibuster but the problem is the Constitution allows the Senate to create its own rules true but the filibuster is not constitutionally required mandate I don't remember that provision of the Constitution right precisely now it's also said and people will say in praise of the filibuster or in justification well you know the Senate is supposed to be a great deliberative body to which I respond absolutely and guess what over the most of the twentieth century and into the 21st we have asked the federal government to do vastly more than its original portfolio so that we were never meant by the framers to be waiting on the Senate to reach consensus about matters that have to do with how citizens conduct their lives namely pensions and benefits in particular housing and education since the 17th amendment since the popular election of senators it appears that the deliberation of that body is the deliberative nature of it has been dramatically weakened well it's it's we have and we've expanded that you know my biggest concern is it was many in the last election was the composition of the Supreme Court and Justice Scalia's death was a blow I mean it was like a punch to the gut so that also of course emphasizes to all of us what can happen when our side is in the minority and we like to have that filibuster power if you will - you know forestall events that we would find trouble like like the elevation of a Supreme Court justice whose opinion perfectly on the Commerce Clause was different from Justice Scalia this would have been the case had McConnell not used the filibuster right new to block the nomination but he had to break the filibuster to elevate justice core search and at this point this is this is like football in two ways number one Chuck Schumer's like Lucy he you know he's the sanctimonious twaddle about how of course now we have to compromise the intones and oh you know there's no intention right he's gonna keep moving that football and Mitch McConnell's Charlie Brown but the other way it's like football is that we have to say at this point you know what we've got to play this quarter because we may not have a game after this and if they don't break the filibuster on cloture on legislation they're never gonna reach a package that will have enough fiscally conservative reforms that we really do need and I'm a partisan and that way a damn it we need Republicans to pass this thing I don't want to exclude Democrats but I don't want them to obstruct we're never gonna get there unless they break the filibuster legislation and to mix metaphors as much as we possibly can you bring up a point that I really admire you for I really admire the way you've conducted yourself from the last from this last presidential election onward which is that you have to play the hand you're dealt you have to play the cards in front of you politics is not about imagining how lovely it would be if something else had happened or if we lived in a different universe where Donald Trump were polite and nice and behaved himself at cocktail parties or that some that Jim Gilmore were the nominee of the Republican Party you have dealt in Rio or Mitch Daniels for I mean you and I you turned me on to Mitch annuals we spent a long time trying to get that guy to run but you know I've spent long enough imagining what it would be like to have that guy run for office and you supported Donald Trump you perhaps the most intelligent and educated member of your class in Congress and possibly in DC period you know I really admire this because you come from circles that would be considered educated elite intelligent socially refined and you put your political goals and the political good of the country before your own image in your own sense of associating with a man who many consider uncouth well and in know Michael we've talked about it but President Trump represented to me by far the better alternative for all of us and he is someone who has acknowledged the advice and counsel of people like Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore and Arendt laughter and David Malpass all of whom have the best ideas on how to move us forward in terms of fiscal policy I know they're not the only voices the president has heard but but we know this quite firmly Hillary Clinton would have given them no credence and you know it if it's a matter of aesthetics the president is blunt he's forthright and he sometimes says things that others might with justification find objectable for one objectionable for one or another reason but we don't elect a president based on aesthetics we base it and look at how he has performed with FEMA with all the people who he and his administration put into place to manage these two back-to-back enormous natural disasters and he's got nothing but praise for it when he's gone overseas and he's talked with our allies they have welcomed him this is a man who understands far more than he's given credit for and you know Michael I am I have run out of patience with and you and I both know the elites of which we speak you're exactly right the Ivy League elites in particular and I'm on the Princeton University politics department Advisory Council I think I was gonna present my diploma I don't know how I stand with them anymore but it's nice that you've that you they haven't totally kicked you out of the raft of work that we did and then it was kind of done for a while but you know what I joined I appreciate it and I think you know there's some terrific people working there including our chairman but at our meeting in October before in 16 before the election we had a discussion after formal business was concluded about for whom we would vote for president and I'm not the only Republican on this committee but I was certainly the only one who said well I'm going to vote for Donald Trump you were the only one you were the only even among Republicans Michael far and away I mean I was sales well Michael as you know those whom we brush if you will you know who do we give the designation establishment Republicans have at least as much disdain or had at least as much disdain for the prospective Trump voter as did Democrats absolutely right that's absolutely right and as certainly at least as much disdain for Donald Trump as they do for Hillary Clinton oh absolutely well so many of them voted for Hillary Clinton and I and I thought you know number one I saw no moral divide between these two candidates you know I didn't think that that really was a valid set of considerations at all for a lot of different reasons you don't think that Hillary is some example of moral purity and virtue and nobility and when she went with Secretary Clinton was first lady and was designated by her president then from her husband and President Lincoln to manage health care I as a woman and as a professional and as someone who's had many blessings in this country and understands that it's generations of women before me who helped make that happen but I was insulted because I thought this is a exactly the wrong message to say that because you're married to the president you know now you are endowed with the power to reshape the nation's healthcare who elected you know one that's that's absolutely right yeah and so switching gears just a little bit it is the the anniversary of 9/11 you and I are both New Yorkers I you know I was a kid when it happened what how should we think about our nation our nation's response to that terrorist attack our nation's response to catastrophes in general sixteen years later well Michael it does as you know these unimaginably horrible events do lift the soul in showing us the best of what our nation represents in the response to not only in the immediate time the incredible courage of the New York Police and Fire Department's you know New York's bravest New York's finest I mean nothing can compare to what they did not only during the attacks but in the aftermath but the Wall Street Journal made a superb point a couple of weeks ago and they had their editorial board had an editorial I think it was called disasters in the wealth of nations and they were referring in the immediate instance to hurricane Harvey we will get through this and the reason we'll get through this and the reason we will rebuild is in no small part not only due to the American spirit which we celebrate but also due to the fact that we are blessed to be within the world's and history's greatest economic engine of prosperity ever known and that is not a random occurrence it is not reasons know exactly it is by design the design of our Constitution the most humane and document ever created and unless we can fully appreciate when calmer moments come and we can think beyond the events at hand and beyond the immediate need for recovery as we do now for for Emma but as we did after September 11th unless we think beyond that to understand that we have to empower those who are most productive empower our workers not have a federal government that imposes unreasonable burdens to have elected officials who can be modest enough to recognize that it is not they who are the heroes it is not they who are supposed to distribute largesse to a needy public but it is in fact their constituents who must be empowered to have the dignity of working and producing for themselves in their society rewards of their work which exactly they don't right now we have a federal government that is confiscatory and predatory and whatever they claim to deliver in terms of benefits people like Charles Schumer who want to set themselves up as our as our heroes because they demand that the federal government do everything for us as much as you know that is actually weakening us and taking away resources and making us inefficient and inefficient if ineffective and dependent so we create wealth by putting Americans to work and letting them do the rest that's a wonderful moral case relating the int the spirit of America the engines of growth that have made America and our resilience are almost our antifragility to borrow a phrase from Nicholas Taleb in the face of catastrophe in the face of natural disaster and terrorist attacks there is something about the American spirit and the American system the American Way of life that is under attack and it's under attack by the left-wing in America and some of it Michael as you know is actually it is facilitated by prosperity and I think that's one reason that President Reagan said so cogently you know that we cannot take our great democracy for granted we must fight for it with every generation freedom isn't about one generation away from extinction exactly exactly I mean we see it happening on college campuses you know your alma mater and mine and they are not isolated alas you know have actually instituted measures that actively suppress speech that's right they don't preach what they practice they don't preach the mechanisms but in their lifestyles or in their professional lives that have allowed them to become what they are absolutely right man on that note we've taken up way too much of your time it was so good to have you here that what a what an excellent message to leave on on this anniversary and and but there's so much more I want to talk to you about I want to talk to you about Trump making deals with Schumer and Pelosi I want to talk to you about all those things but we don't have time so we'll just have to bring it back all right thank you nan ladies and gentlemen and Haworth the first female physician ever elected to Congress with that we have got to bring on our panel of deplorable z nan could never be on the panel of deplorable because there's nothing to plural a batter other than that she voted for Donald Trump so right now we're very lucky to have Jacob Airy and Emily Butler so let's talk a little bit more about let's go right back to the politics we've had all of the uplifting stuff from congresswoman at nan Hayworth so let's go back into Steve Bannon perhaps not as uplifting I want to know Emily does Bannon have any clout or you know is he speaking for the Trump administration or is he just some jilted ex-employee I don't think that Bannon ever actually speaks for anyone other than Bannon Bannon is out for himself and Bannon is a strategist at heart he's speaking to an audience and maybe audience isn't exactly a parent when you're watching him on you know CBS or 60 minutes there is always a hierarchy that's at play and with van and especially at this point in his career he has a new objective to think about you know he reached his objective to get into the White House that objective has been fulfilled and subsequently tossed aside so he has a new objective that he needs to fulfill II as a new prerogative and a new order that he needs to establish so I would say there's a man trying to regain relevancy is the first step towards rebuilding his agenda much less of an employee going broke on that note however I do think that as Trump's administration winds down or if there's a new opportunity for Bannen to squeeze in there he's probably not gonna hold back on some negative comments when the administration maybe not on Trump personally hmm but there will definitely be an opportunity that he will seize but what's his idol here I mean why is he going on 60 minutes why is he going into the heart of stupidity and lazy leftism with Charlie Rose I mean I'm not Steve Bannon but if I was Steve band I'd be thinking about what the plan is to get back to the top of your empire he's been totally wiped out he's been sort of Dishonored a little bit yeah sidelined by being kicked out of the administration so you have to think about what what I need to do to rebuild and the first step to that is getting as wide an audience as possible while it's relevant while people still want to hear from you both the left and the right you see the same thing with Hillary Clinton all at the time just giving interview upon an interview on how she feels about her loss you know Trump Bannon is capitalizing on exactly the same thing he wants to speak out while he's still relevant and while he's going back to Breitbart and then if there's an opportunity to catch any leftist mainstream media in a hypocrisy in a crosshairs he can seize on that he can fight back on that with everything in his jaws and come out looking even better as he returns to restore himself as the captain the leader of the head of Breitbart Charlie Rose is a hack but he does have a network television platform CBS as usual first channel people see when you turn on your TV yeah I guess that's it just grab the platform Jacob in that interview Bannon says that the original sin of the administration was making a deal with the establishment Republicans that they're playing nice with them is he right and isn't there a fair question how would they govern without establishment republicanism well I think it depends on what he means by establishment Republicans because some people are lumping in conservatives who I should say real conservatives in with the establishment Republican so I don't know if that is who Bannon is referring to but I think Trump is a deal maker right that's what he always bragged about I'll make the deals I'll make the best deals and so for him to say oh it's the original sin to deal with the establishment Republicans the GOP is the party in power who else is he gonna make a deal with I know he's he's chiming in about making a deal with Schumer and Nancy Pelosi but if he wants to move his fiscal policy forward and everything that has to do with immigration he has to deal with the establishment Republicans because the Democrats aren't going to help him so I don't really think it's fair to call it the original sin of the administration fair enough there's the religious ruling from Pastor Jacob Airy we now a pastor former pastor J Perry we nun like Paul Bois who's the future Pope we now have got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube now I know you all want to keep listening you want to talk to the panel of deplorable you want to hear about Pope Francis and illegal immigrants and Miss America and a final thought about 9/11 but the only way that you can do that is go to daily wire.com right now it's $10 a month $100 a year you get me you get the intercalate and show you get the Ben Shapiro show forget all that bad what is that worth a nickel a dime but you get the leftist here's tumbler this I would pay at least the cost of a hundred Steve Crowder mugs to get this leftist here's tumbler it is the finest vessel for your leftist tiers known to man you can have them hot or cold they'll always be salty and delicious and it will never rust from the salt of those leftist ears so go over there right now daily wired.com and be right back Pope Francis suggested today that pro-lifers must support Obama's executive amnesty saying the President of the United States presents himself as pro-life and if he is a good pro-lifer he understands that family is the cradle of life and its unity must be protected he added I think this law comes not from Parliament but from the executive if that is so I am hopeful that it will be rethought Emily you're a Catholic what is a good conservative Catholic to do with left-wing popes probably the same thing that any good patriot needed to do under President Obama which is just kind of hold your tongue take the doctrine as it comes and wait for a new pope good bad Pope's before this isn't a new thing sometimes the Lord sends his bad popes to let us know that the Pope is only infallible when he's not fallible and I'm not even saying he's a bad Pope but he does weigh in a lot on matters of domestic American politics which seem not to have very much to do with Scripture so the number one priority of the Catholic Church is the salvation of souls in that doctrine it does say that the Pope is quote-unquote infallible that goes back to Catholic doctrine well he's infallible when he spits exactly right he's infallible when he speaks ex cathedra right on matters of doctrine this does not have anything to do with personal opinions on climate change it doesn't have personal opinions on immigration those things that he says are sort of unique to this Pope himself we're not necessarily as Catholics obligated to heed or obey anything that he says from his personal lectern when it comes down to doctrine he's still very Pope like you've seen him I mean you see him come back to you know sort of irritating the leftist with reiterating his stances the Catholic stances on abortion transgenderism these are things that are still Catholic doctrine he said of gay marriage too he said when it was up for a vote in Argentina that this is not a mere political issue but it is quote a machination of the father of lies that seeks to deceive and confuse the children of God does not sound like a Democrat in that statement no and I think I recall a long time ago where he tried to personally sort of make gay marriage or gay relationships not a sin and kind of got slapped back down by the church from that and then came out and sort of backtracked that statement that he made it's always difficult because we have this lens of the mainstream media so the Pope says something and he might be making some political point it might be a small point and then the Huffington Post blows it up like you know the Pope doesn't believe in Jesus anymore and you say well I don't I didn't see that anywhere in his statement Jacob whatever happened to render unto Caesar that which is Caesars st. Paul writes quote let everyone be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which God has established the authorities that exist have been established by God consequently whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against God of what God has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves and that would seem to be the case for the immigration laws of the United States is the Pope contradicting Catholic teaching by denouncing the enforcement of a perfectly legitimate law I don't necessarily think so I know you fear hell you don't want to be struck down on the spot sure enough I don't think that I think what Paul is saying that you you can have a personal opinion and I honestly think the Pope's on what the Pope's words don't affect our policy so I think it's okay for the Pope to have a personal opinion I just want to know where his opinions are on the encroaching socialism and secularization of Europe as opposed to this one law in the United States and often people misquote the render to Caesar what is Caesar's what is the question that is asked of Christ is is it a sin to pay taxes to Caesar and so he says render to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is to God he's not he was saying it no it is not a sin to pay your tab because there were there were certain shall we say pious groups back then who were teaching that and Jesus was saying that's not thing is a sin to pay your taxes I never do it I try to avoid it as much as possible Catholic Church the Catholic Church is not the only venerable institution that is speaking less than infallibly about American politics this is even infected the Miss America pageant 2018 we don't have the clip I thought we had the clip of it but one of the questions that was asked of Miss America was what do you think about the Trump collusion narrative did Donald Trump collude with Russia to win the election and how so and when will he get caught Jacob why does the Left have to make every good thing boring they've ruined colleges they have made sex boring that now they're going after hot chicks in bikinis why can't we have nice things it's exactly what you said they cannot leave it alone oh my gosh I you know I just want to see I don't care what she thinks about the Russia collusion conspiracy theory because that's all it is a conspiracy theory you know I know Maxine Waters she likes to talk about the Kremlin kraut clan and she likes to go all over the place and sing the Internet's trying to kill her this is where these the left is getting their information leave Miss America alone you know Emily you bring up a great point because this is a conspiracy theory at this point Emily does the left really believe that anyone cares what Miss America thinks about these crazy Democrat conspiracy theories or is this just about coercing every aspect of the culture to recite and toe the line on leftist orthodoxy well as like a member United States and as like a member of the human race I think it's important that like all of humanity have their voices heard so I think that of course it's important to hear what we say especially as a can beauty pageant contestant I'm really pretty you know that was more intelligent and coherent than the question that was asked at Miss America so kudos to you on that I think if I can answer seriously with mom I think that probably the people who care the most about what the American Miss America pageant contestants have to say is the contestants themselves clearly you know when you're talking about all these questions that have been posed to them the political nature of the questions and you can hear how they want the question to be answered so when you're a quiet you're a pageant contestant you're standing up on the stage all you care about is like winning this crown right so you're going to reiterate back anything that they're going to ask you exactly how you think you want how do you think they want the question answered so when you look back at it it's there's not really like anything that they're saying that's real or that like they actually care about or they're believing in it's about continuing on this narrative about something they probably haven't even researched absolutely right and I'm ripped by the way I'm really upset the only reason that I wanted to talk about Miss America today was to be able to watch them on the screen during this and we don't have the clip so it's absolutely pointless as far as I'm concerned okay panel of deplorable 'z Emily Butler and Jacob Airy thank you for being here we'll have you back now it is the it's the 16th anniversary you know of September 11th and so we haven't talked about it very much and I'll I think I would like to talk about that in my final thought so I'll put on my smart glasses it's the 16th anniversary of the September 11th terror attacks my 6th grade math teacher broke the news to us in suburban New York my mother saw the Towers fall with her own eyes and from Harlem she made it onto one of the last trains out of the city some of my classmates parents didn't make it out of the city not that day and not ever after the second plane struck father George Rutley ran from midtown to the Twin Towers to offer wartime absolution to the firemen rushing into the buildings the first confirmed death on that day was a Catholic priest named Michael judge next to the towers in st. Peter's Church the first Catholic parish in New York Father rattler met fireman who carried father judges body and recalled quote they put his body in front of the altar it was very moving there is a picture of the crucifixion over the altar I remember blood coming down the altar steps I shall always remember that scene the image of oak's st. Paul's letter to the Ephesians we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places sixteen years ago President George Bush put it in his own words and I'll leave you with that the pictures of airplanes flying into buildings fires burning huge huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief terrible sadness and a quiet unyielding anger you
