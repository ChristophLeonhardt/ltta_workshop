1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Prince was an icon.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,540
He was a performer.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,160
"Let's
go crazy"

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,140
"Go crazy!"

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
He was an actor.

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,340
"That ain't Lake Minnetonka."

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,080
He was one of the most talented musicians of his generation.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,240
But above all he was a
songwriter.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,440
"Purple rain, purple rain."

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,440
And he was such a prolific songwriter, that he wrote songs for other artists. And more than a few

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,640
artists covered his lesser-known songs to
make a name for themselves. The most famous

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,130
example starts with this image of a beautiful
woman with a buzzed head.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,399
"It's been seven hours and 15 days..."

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,360
Sinead O’Connor’s incredible one-hit-wonder
torch song Nothing Compares 2 U gives me chills

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,969
every time I listen to it.

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,789
But if numbers and the letter U in the song
title didn’t remind you of Prince –

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:03,559
"Nothing compares – nothing compares to
you."

18
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,499
Making a pop song this slow is another good
clue.

19
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,399
Listen to the intro of Purple Rain.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,420
Once you hear that, it’s less of a shock
to hear it out of Prince’s mouth, in 1985

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,520
on “The Family” album.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
"It's been seven hours and 15 days..."

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,899
…which was just Prince by another name.

24
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,700
"... since you took your love away."

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,389
And if you put that version over Purple Rain..

26
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:45,249
"I go out every night and sleep all day..."

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,900
well, they’ve got a lot in common.

28
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,580
"...since you took your love away."

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,160
Another surprise is Manic Monday by the Bangles
(1985).

30
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:02,629
"Six O'clock already I was just in the middle
of a dream."

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
You can’t deny these hooks – they really
sound like Prince.

32
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:12,229
"I was dreaming when I wrote this, forgive
me if it goes astray."

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,840
"Just another manic monday."

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
He wrote it under a pseudonym, “Christopher.”

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,780
He launched Morris Day and the Time to the
national stage in Purple Rain.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,560
Jungle Love – which he co-wrote as “Jamie Starr”
with Morris Day and produced as “The Starr

37
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,189
Company” – that was probably their biggest
hit. But he also wrote many other songs for

38
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,599
The Time.

39
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,680
He gave “Sugar Walls” to Sheena Easton
in 1984.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,689
He gave “The Glamorous Life” to Shiela
E., a collaborator on Purple Rain, and it

41
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,640
hit #7 on billboard.

42
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,150
And he co-wrote a song with Stevie Nicks.

43
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,359
"...Stand back, stand back."

44
00:02:47,359 --> 00:03:00,650
This melody came to Stevie while she was listening
“Little Red Corvette” on her wedding day

45
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:00,829
in 1983.

46
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,209
And when she was recording it, she called
up Prince from the studio to tell him she

47
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,590
was going to give him 50% of the royalties.
According to Nicks, he showed up 20 minutes

48
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,010
later and played on the song.

49
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,120
He co-wrote with Madonna in 1988.

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,230
"Say what you mean, mean what you say. Don't
go and throw our love away."

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,170
And Chaka Kahn grabbed an old Prince song
from 1979 –

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,780
"Baby, baby when Iook at you, I get a warm
feeling inside..."

53
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,810
– and turned it into a platinum selling
album.

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,659
"I feel for you. I think I love you."

55
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,260
Prince grabbed a Grammy for his then 5-year-old
song.

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,700
Alicia Keys tried this too in 2001.

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,689
That song was a B-side to this song you might
have heard before.

58
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,810
"So, tonight we're gonna party like its 1999."

59
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,290
TLC dipped into the Prince well too–

60
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,599
"If I was your girlfriend"

61
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,439
But it's not like "If I Was Your Girlfriend"
was completely unknown before that. It was

62
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,609
the second single on "Sign 'O' The Times."
That wasn't the last time it'd turn up either.

63
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:08,260
Beyoncé and Jay-Z quote it in their song
Bonnie and Clyde –

64
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,390
"If I was your girlfriend..."

65
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,760
– which is actually mostly a cover of Tupac's
"Me and my girlfriend."

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,130
"Look for me, lost in world..."

67
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,170
But in that song, Tupac's girlfriend is a
gun.

68
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,700
"One shot making N****s heartbeats stop."

69
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,210
Obviously this could go on and on. No video
about the gigantic influence of Prince would

70
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,470
ever be complete.

71
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,170
But let’s end with MC Hammer.

72
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
"Can't touch this."

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,240
After he sampled another titan of 80s music,
Rick James,

74
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,440
"She's a super freak. Super freak. She's super
freaky."

75
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,280
He needed another hit. So he went with
a no brainer.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,200
"That's why we pray. All my live I've wanted
to make it to the top. That's why we pray."

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:00:00,000
He sampled When Doves Cry.
