all you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days and it shows that they're rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before that's the president at a rally last night in Minnesota and Jean your latest piece in The Washington Post gets to this it's titled Democrats get mad about Cavanaugh then get even jeanne writes in part pay attention Democrats watch what Republicans are doing you'll see what raw power looks like and understand why winning in November is so vital for the nation's future president Trump aware that the country is passionately divided on many critical issues could have nominated a moderate jurist instead Trump nominated Brett and Cavanaugh a darling of far-right pressure groups that want to topple the remaining pillars of progressive jurisprudence including roe v wade Republicans have always taken judicial nominations more seriously than Democrats and Cavanaugh's defiance seems to have inspired even some GOP stalwarts who see Trump as a clownish interloper but if Democrats are not equally motivated by this outrageous power play then they don't deserve to win Democrats cannot afford to be discouraged they need to keep talking about the issues that have found residence among voters they need to get minorities and young voters to the polls as the Cavanaugh issue inevitably fades for Republicans Democrats need to keep their eyes on the prize so gene we've seen a spike short-term spike in GOP enthusiasm we've seen a closing of the gap in some of these close Senate races I guess the question is what happens in the interim we got a vote Saturday night or early Sunday morning whenever Steve Daines gets back from the wedding right and after that what happens to that enthusiasm if Cavanaugh is confirmed there's a Republican enthusiasm fade this democrat go up I guess that's the question with about a month till Election Day you know it's that's a great question Willie that's kind of the question right now and it depends on what happens I mean yeah I have always believed that this huge enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans was going to close somehow I didn't know that this would be the way it would close I didn't know that it would close as rapidly as it seems to have but there was just no way that that that gap was gonna gonna stay that way all them all the way through November now but what happens depends on the vote really if Cavanaugh gets confirmed I think that does fade somewhat as as an issue for Republicans because you'll be on the court and and I think I think Democrats will continue to be motivated which they probably will anyhow if he gets defeated then I I can see Republicans continuing to be riled up I don't know that we're gonna see a diminution of democratic enthusiasm because Democrats have been enthusiastic for a while looking toward this midterm but you know it kind of depends on what happens thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
