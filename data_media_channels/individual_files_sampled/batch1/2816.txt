it's such a cheesy thing but you have to kind of follow your instinct a little bit I think it's that's like the greatest tool for sure people try to give me advice all the time actually and I usually ignore it because I don't I think everybody has to find their own path I'm sure there was you know there was tons of people in the beginning that said why are you doing a collection with payless like that why do you think that that's interesting and I'm like well I think it's interesting because I was 20 years old being offered multi-million dollar deal to design shoes and bags and I wasn't a shoe designer who's going to say no to that that's exciting and then it turned into almost ten years later selling almost you know billions of shoes like that's kind of crazy so imagine if I took that advice and said and didn't go with it so I do think there is a big part about it if you like it's such a cheesy thing but you have to kind of follow your instinct a little bit I think it's that's like the greatest tool for sure at least it's worked for me in my world
