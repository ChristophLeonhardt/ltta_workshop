1
00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:02,319
THAT FIRST PROMPTED THE FALSE

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:03,287
WARNING TO THE GOVERNMENT TO BAT

3
00:00:03,287 --> 00:00:05,089
ON DOWN THE HATCHES AND THAT WAS

4
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,056
THEN, A VERY DIFFERENT

5
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:07,357
ENVIRONMENT AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE

6
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:08,559
LOOKING FORWARD TO THOSE TALKS

7
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,560
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE

8
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,595
NORTH KOREAN LEADER AS WELL AS

9
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,396
SOME PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS ON

10
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,465
THE RELEASE OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES

11
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:15,699
HELD THERE, THREE OF THEM THERE

12
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:18,068
MIGHT BE MORE, DOWN THE ROAD,

13
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,304
THE PRESIDENT HAS YET TO SET A

14
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:21,605
DATE AND A LOCATION FOR THAT.

15
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,373
HE SAYS HE KNOWS IT WILL SHARE

16
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:24,408
IT SOON WITH EVERYBODY.

17
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,976
THE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO

18
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:27,811
THE UNITED NATIONS SO MUCH MORE

19
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,346
BILL RICHARDSON AMBASSADOR GOOD

20
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:29,913
TO HAVE YOU.

21
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:30,948
>>  THANK YOU, NEIL.

22
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,083
NEIL: WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN

23
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,084
NEGOTIATING WITH THE NORTH

24
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,919
KOREANS YOU SERVED THAT ROLE

25
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,187
BACK DURING THE CLINTON

26
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:37,988
ADMINISTRATION.

27
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,990
I THINK YOU SAID YOU HAVE TO BE

28
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,024
CAREFUL VERIFYING EVERYTHING YOU

29
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,793
HEAR OUT OF THEM.

30
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,495
YOU DEALT WITH KIM JONG-UN'S

31
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,996
FATHER, BUT THIS GOES BACK TO

32
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,297
HIS GRANDFATHER AS WELL, THAT

33
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,667
THEY SAY ONE THING, DO ANOTHER,

34
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,402
SO IF YOU WERE TO ADVISE THE

35
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:53,470
PRESIDENT'S PEOPLE TALKING TO

36
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,306
KIM JONG-UN NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU

37
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:56,807
TELL THEM?

38
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,475
>>  I WOULD SAY TO WATCH OUT,

39
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,044
THAT HE'S PROBABLY GOT SOMETHING

40
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:02,746
UP HIS SLEEVE LIKE RIGHT BEFORE

41
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,248
A BIG NEGOTIATION LIKE WHAT'S

42
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:05,682
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH A SUMMIT.

43
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:08,318
THE NORTH KOREANS DO A CHARM

44
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:08,685
OFFENSIVE.

45
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,187
THEY PUT OUT GOOD PRESS

46
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:11,088
STATEMENTS THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

47
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:12,656
GOING TO DO, WE'RE GOING TO

48
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,992
CLOSE DOWN A NUCLEAR FACILITY,

49
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,260
THEY PROBABLY LEAKED THAT

50
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,628
THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE THE

51
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:19,563
THREE AMERICANS BEFORE THE

52
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:19,897
SUMMIT.

53
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,431
YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH THEM AND

54
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:22,833
YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CONSCIENCE

55
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,468
OF THE DETAILS.

56
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:26,703
MY WORRY, NEIL, IS THE PRESIDENT

57
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:29,373
GOES INTO THE SUMMIT AND UNLESS

58
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:32,709
WE HAVE HAVE HAVE A STRATEGY OF

59
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,078
WHERE WE WANT TO END UP THESE

60
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,680
GUYS ARE VERY SKILLFUL AND

61
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,080
RELENTLESS.

62
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,249
THEY DON'T THINK LIKE US THEY'RE

63
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,150
NOT INTO QUID PRO QUO, THEY

64
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,452
THINK THEY'RE TOTALLY RIGHT, THE

65
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:43,820
DIVINE RIGHT OF THE FATHER AND

66
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,489
GRANDFATHER AS YOU MENTIONED AND

67
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:45,989
NOW KIM JONG-UN.

68
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:46,690
NEIL: ALL RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS

69
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,091
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS FAVORING

70
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,826
TALKS INTO THE DEMILITARIZED

71
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,428
ZONE, THAT IT'S EASIER, IT'S

72
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:53,063
PROBABLY BETTER OPTICS, HE

73
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:54,264
DIDN'T SAY THAT BUT THAT SEEMS

74
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:55,098
TO BE THE VIEW.

75
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:56,800
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

76
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,268
>>  NO, DO YOU KNOW WHY, NEIL?

77
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,503
I'VE BEEN TO THAT AREA.

78
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:00,971
THE WAY YOU MAKE DEALS WITH THE

79
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:03,640
NORTH KOREANS IS INFORMALLY.

80
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,442
LIKE I HEARD THAT MAYBE THERE'S

81
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:07,311
GOING TO BE A DINNER OR THEY'RE

82
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:08,711
GOING TO WALK TOGETHER AND TALK,

83
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,846
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

84
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:13,417
YOU KNOW, THAT AREA IS TOO

85
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:13,817
COMPRESSED.

86
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,053
YOU MAKE DEALS WITH THE NORTH

87
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,287
KOREANS AND INFORMAL SETTINGS

88
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,189
AND IN TABLE TO TABLE THEY'RE

89
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,891
GOING TO VENT, WILL VENT BACK

90
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,658
AND FORTH.

91
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:22,960
NEIL: YOU LIKE PROOF WE WERE

92
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,928
SHOWING THE TIME THAT YOU HELPED

93
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:27,130
RESCUE AN AMERICAN PRISONER

94
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,665
THERE, BUT YOU WERE BIG ON

95
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,067
SAYING THAT I NEED TO SEE IT

96
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,969
BEFORE I COULD TALK ABOUT IT,

97
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,570
THE SAME WOULD APPLY NOW I GUESS

98
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,305
TO THE RELEASE OF THESE HOSTAGES

99
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,174
, AND ANY AGREEMENT THE

100
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:38,508
PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY SAID HE'LL

101
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,210
WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE IF IT

102
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,445
DOESN'T LOOK PROMISING AND BY

103
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:42,946
THAT HE MEANS WHETHER THE NORTH

104
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,349
KOREANS ARE GOING TO AGREE TO

105
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,985
SOMETHING FIRM AND COMMIT TO

106
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:49,620
CHECKING WHAT THEY'RE PROMISING

107
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,920
RIGHT?

108
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,622
>>  WELL YOU KNOW I'M NOT A BIG

109
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:53,657
FAN OF THE PRESIDENT'S TWEETS

110
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:55,325
AND ANNOUNCING, YOU KNOW, LIKE

111
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:56,927
ANNOUNCING THEY'RE GOING TO BE

112
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,362
RELEASED SO THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

113
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:58,729
RELEASED.

114
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,330
THE NORTH KOREANS DECIDE WHEN

115
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,332
THE PRISONERS ARE RELEASED AND I

116
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,667
WORRY ABOUT SAYING WELL I'LL

117
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,902
WALK OUT . THE NORTH KOREANS ARE

118
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:06,970
VERY SENSITIVE.

119
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,438
DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T DESERVE

120
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,476
THAT SCRUTINY, BUT I JUST WISH

121
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,543
TRADITIONAL DIPLOMACY WOULD

122
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:15,712
GOVERN THE PRESIDENT'S STYLE,

123
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:16,013
BUT --

124
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,447
NEIL: BUT LOOK HOW FAR ITS TAKEN

125
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,349
US THIS UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH,

126
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,219
ITS GOT US THIS FAR THE TWO

127
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,587
LEADERS COULD BE TALKING, RIGHT?

128
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:25,289
>>  WELL THINGS ARE GOING WELL

129
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,658
THE SOUTH KOREAN SUMMIT, THE

130
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,625
OLYMPICS NOW THIS SUMMIT.

131
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,327
LOOK I'VE SAID THE PRESIDENT

132
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,828
DESERVES CREDIT FOR MEETING KIM

133
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:34,831
JONG-UN, AGREEING SENDING POMPEO

134
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,566
, YOU KNOW, I'M HOPEFUL.

135
00:03:36,566 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S THE BEST I'VE SEEN IN A
