SECRETARY ALEX ACOSTA. 
AND ADMINISTRATOR LINDA MCMAHON,
A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG 
TIME. 
LINDA. 
WHERE IS LINDA? 
WHERE IS LINDA? 
THANK YOU. 
AND ALSO PAUL JUST GOT -- JUST 
LEFT. 
I SAID GO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO 
PASS LEGISLATION. 
WE'RE PASSING SO MUCH. 
LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH 
OUR SUPREME COURT. 
LOOK AT THE VICTORIES WE HAVE 
HAD. 
LOOK AT THE VICTORIES WE'VE 
HAD. 
AND TERRY, I DIDN'T SPEAK TO 
HIM ABOUT IT, BUT HE WILL BE IN 
PARTICULARLY HAPPY ABOUT ONE OF 
THOSE VICTORIES. 
DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE? 
I THINK YOU DO. 
I WANT TO THANK PAUL RYAN. 
I WANT TO THANK OUR GREAT 
CONGRESSMAN GLENN. 
WHERE IS GLENN? 
GLENN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
GOOD JOB. 
GLENN. 
WHERE IS GLENN? 
GLENN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
GREAT JOB, GLENN. 
AND WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER 
OFFICIALS. 
BUT I HAVE TO THANK A MAN WHO I 
GAVE IT TO. 
IT'S LIKE HANDING OFF THE 
FOOTBALL AND HE RAN FOR 200 
YARDS THAT GAME. 
MOST PEOPLE COULD NOT HAVE DONE 
IT. 
TERRY AND I HAD HAVE HAD A 
GREAT RELATIONSHIP. 
AND TERRY WAS THINKING ABOUT 
DOING THIS. 
AND DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL  GUY. 
HE WAS IN MY OFFICE. 
A FRIEND OF MINE SET IT UP. 
HE SAID I WANT TO INVEST $50 
BILLION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
I SAID YOU DON'T MEAN 50 
BILLION. 
YOU MEAN 50 MILLION. 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH A 
FIVE-MINUTE MEETING, 50 
MILLION. 
AND SO I THOUGHT HE WAS SAYING 
50 MILLION. 
I WANT TODAY MAKE IT QUICK. 
BUT I HEARD ABOUT HIM. 
HE ALONG WITH TERRY THEY'RE 
BEST FRIENDS. 
HE CAME OUT AND I SAID SO GOOD 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO INVEST 
IN? 
HE SAID -- I SAID YOU CAN'T DO 
THAT FOR 50 MILLION. 
AND HE SAID NO I WANT TO INVEST 
50 BILLION. 
AND HE MISREPRESENTED TO ME. 
HE DID. 
BECAUSE HE SPENT MUCH MORE THAN 
$50 BILLION IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
AND THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. 
AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO A 
LOT MORE. 
I WANT TO THANK MASSA. 
I WANT TO THANK HIM. 
COME UP HERE. 
HE DOESN'T PLAY GAMES. 
HE DOESN'T LIKE SMALL NUMBERS. 
ARE YOU PROUD OF TERRY. 
>> YES, I AM. 
>> SAY SOMETHING ABOUT TERRY. 
COME ON. 
>> TERRY IS MY BEST FRIEND. 
AND WE ARE THE BROTHERS. 
>> WHAT ABOUT ME? 
NO? 
>> OF COURSE. 
>> SO I PROMISED THE FIRST TIME 
THAT I MET PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST 
BEFORE YOU BECAME OFFICIAL 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> I THINK I WAS THE FIRST CEO 
CAME TO CELEBRATE. 
>> THAT'S TRUE. 
THAT'S TRUE. 
AND. 
>> AND I SAID $50 BILLION 
INVESTMENT AND 50,000 JOBS TO 
THE UNITED STATES. 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T HAVE DECIDED 
SUCH A THING BEFORE THIS NEW 
PRESIDENT. 
BECAUSE I SAID, NOW I SEE THE 
PASSION, I SEE THE OPPORTUNITY. 
I'M MORE ENERGIZED. 
SO I MADE A PROMISE. 
AND NOW I'M VERY HAPPY. 
WE'RE MAKING GREAT SUCCESS. 
AND I SAID I HAVE ONE MORE 
THING TO PROMISE, WHICH IS 
FOXCONN. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> DID I NOT HAVE OFFICIAL 
OFFICIAL PERMISSION FROM TERRY 
BUT I PROMISED. 
>> YOU BROUGHT HIM ALONG. 
RIGHT. 
YOU BROUGHT HIM ALONG. 
>> I'M SO HAPPY TODAY THAT MY 
PROMISE CAME TO TRUTH. 
SO THIS IS A GREAT HISTORICAL 
MOMENT BECAUSE I THINK THE 
UNITED STATES DID NOT HAVE THE 
ECOSYSTEM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY 
LAST 20 YEARS. 
AND NOW THIS IS THE BEGINNING 
OF NEW ECOSYSTEM OF HIGH TECH 
MANUFACTURING BACK INTO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
>> THANK YOU. 
ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESS MEN 
OF THE WORLD ALSO. 
THOSE TWO. 
THAT IS SOME COMBINATION 
STANDING BACK STAGE. 
I SAID WHOA. 
BUT THEY LIKE EACH OTHER. 
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER. 
AND HIS 50 BILLION TURNED OUT 
TO BE 72 BILLION SO FAR. 
HE IS NOT FINISHED YET. 
AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE 
FOXCONN. 
SO BIG STUFF. 
I WANT TO THANK ANOTHER VERY 
SPECIAL MAN. 
I HOPE HE CAN HEAR ME BECAUSE I 
WANT HIM TO COME ON STAGE 
BECAUSE I HANDED THE BALL OVER. 
TERRY IS A FRIEND OF MINE. 
AND I RECOMMENDED WISCONSIN IN 
THIS CASE. 
AND I'LL BE RECOMMENDING OHIO 
AND I'LL BE RECOMMENDING 
PENNSYLVANIA AND I'LL BE 
RECOMMENDING IOWA AND I'LL BE 
RECOMMENDING -- BUT THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT JUST SEEMED 
RIGHT. 
AND THE REASON IS THAT YOU HAVE 
A CAR PLANT IN A VERY NICE 
LOCATION. 
AND I FLEW OVER THAT PLANT WITH 
ANOTHER GREAT WISCONSINITE. 
I THINK HE IS AROUND HERE OR 
SOMETHING. 
HE'S A GREAT GUY. 
I SAID THAT WOULD BE A GOOD 
SITE. 
TE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SIZE 
IS ABOUT -- OF THAT SITE. 
THIS IS BIG STUFF. 
I HANDED IT OVER TO TERRY. 
I SAID THIS PLACE IS SUCH A 
GREAT PLACE. 
YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED THE 
OTHER DAY THEY TOLD ME, WHEN WE 
WON THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, IT 
HADN'T BEEN WON BY A REPUBLICAN 
SINCE DWIGHT D EISENHOWER IN 
1952. 
DID YOU KNOW THAT? 
AND I WON WISCONSIN. 
AND I LIKE WISCONSIN A LOT. 
BUT WE WON WISCONSIN. 
AND RONALD REAGAN, REMEMBER, 
WISCONSIN WAS THE STATE THAT 
RONALD REAGAN DID NOT WIN. 
AND THAT WAS IN 1952. 
AND I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE 
PEOPLE HERE. 
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE. 
I SAID TO TERRY, THIS WOULD BE 
AN INCREDIBLE PLACE. 
THEN I HEARD THE MAGNITUDE. 
THIS IS MAGNITUDE THAT NONE OF 
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. 
SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
SEE IT. 
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, THE 
ABSOLUTE BEGINNING. 
SOY HAD THIS INCREDIBLE COMPANY 
GOING TO INVEST SOMEPLACE IN 
THE WORLD. 
NOT HERE NECESSARILY. 
I WILL TELL YOU THEY WOULDN'T 
HAVE DONE IT HERE EXCEPT I 
BECAME PRESIDENT, SO THAT IS 
GOOD. 
BUT THEY WANT TODAY DO IT 
SOMEPLACE NOW IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF 
THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. 
TERRY CAME UP, FELL IN LOVE 
WITH THE PEOPLE, FELL IN LOVE 
WITH THE LOCATION, FELL IN LOVE 
WITH THE CONCEPT HERE. 
HE'S GOING TO MAKE ROBOTICS 
HERE. 
THEY'RE DOING MANY OTHER 
THINGS, INCLUDING FULL 
TELEVISION SETS. 
THEY'RE DOING MANY THINGS HERE. 
AND THEY WILL DO A LOT OF 
EXPANSION. 
BUT I HAD TO HAND OFF THE BALL. 
IN PRIVATE LIFE, YOU KNOW, YOU 
HAND OFF THE BALL AND SOMETIMES 
THEY DO A GOOD JOB AND 
SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE, WHAT 
HAPPENED? 
DIDN'T WORK OUT. 
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK OUT? 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 
THEY WERE DOING. 
AND SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS. 
THERE ARE VERY FEW GOVERNORS I 
COULD HAVE SAID GOOD LUCK 
YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD ONE OF 
THE LARGEST OPERATIONS IN THE 
WORLD, OVER 20 MILLION FEET. 
GOOD LUCK. 
I GAVE IT TO SCOTT WALKER. 
HE LITERALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO 
MAKE A PHONE CALL TO ME FOR THE 
LAST YEAR AND A HALF. 
HE IS AN UNBELIEVABLY TALENTED 
GUY. 
I'M TELLING YOU, SCOTT WALKER. 
SCOTT, COME HERE. 
IS SCOTT AROUND, PLEASE? 
SCOTT WALKER. 
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. 
COME HERE. 
>> WHATEVER HE SAID, HE SHOULD 
SAY. 
>> WELL, THANKS, MR. PRESIDENT. 
AS YOU MENTIONED, YOU GOT THE 
BALL ROLLING. 
FOXCONN WOULD NOT BE IN AMERICA 
IF NOT FOR YOU. 
BACK IN APRIL 2017 WHEN YOU 
TOLD TERRY ABOUT NOT ONLY BEING 
IN AMERICA BUT TOLD THEM THERE 
WAS A GOOD SITE. 
HONEST TRUTH. 
WE SAID WE HAVE TO GET A BIGGER 
SITE THAN THAT BECAUSE THIS IS 
BIGGER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT. 
YOUR TEAM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, 
JARED, YOUR CABINET WAS HANDS 
ON DECK. 
GREAT TEAM EFFORT HERE. 
WE COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO 
HAVE FOXCONN'S 8K TECHNOLOGY 
LCD PANELS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
EVER OUTSIDE OF ASIA MADE HERE 
IN THE UNITED STATES, HERE IN 
THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. 
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> WE LOVE YOU. 
TAKE CARE. 
>> SO I GAVE SCOTT THE BALL AND 
HE CARRIED THE BALL. 
AND IF THAT WERE A FOOTBALL 
STANDARDS, HE RAN FOR ABOUT 
2,000 YARDS IN ONE GAME. 
SPECIAL GUY. 
SPECIAL TALENT. 
FORGET ABOUT SPECIAL GUY. 
HE IS A SPECIAL TALENT. 
SO I HOPE HE DOESN'T RUN 
AGAINST ME. 
THAT COMMENT -- THAT COMMENT 
WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT ME. 
HE IS A SPECIAL TALENT AND A 
SPECIAL PERSON. 
AS FOXCONN HAS DISCOVERED, 
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO 
BUILD HIGHER IN GROW THAN RIGHT 
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS 
MORE THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN OPEN 
FOR BUSINESS. 
BETWEEN OUR LOW TAXES, OUR 
CUTTING OF REGULATIONS. 
WE'RE NOT FINISHED WITH THE 
REGULATIONS. 
AND WE WILL HAVE REGULATION. 
BUT IT IS SENSIBLE REGULATION. 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THINGS 
APPROVED QUICKLY. 
OR DISAPPROVED. 
SOMETIMES IT IS GOING TO BE 
DISAPPROVED. 
WE HAVE CLEAN AIR. 
WE HAVE CRYSTAL CLEAN WATER. 
WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF THE 
THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO BUT 
WE'RE GOING TO SPEED UP THE 
PROCESS. 
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO 
BUILD A PLANT LIKE THIS, IT 
WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM 25 YEARS 
TO GET APPROVALS. 
25 YEARS. 
THEY GOT THEM ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY. 
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD 
A LOT TO SAY. 
WE HAD TO GET GOING. 
AND THEY DID. 
AND HERE WE ARE. 
AND THEY'RE STARTING OTHER 
SECTIONS RIGHT NOW. 
SO WE'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 
MADE IN THE USA. 
IT IS ALL HAPPENING AND IT IS 
HAPPENING VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 
WE'VE CREATED 3.4 MILLION JOBS 
SINCE THE ELECTION. 
INCLUDING OVER 300,000 
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
AND AS YOU SAW THE RECENT POLL 
JUST CAME OUT. 
THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF 
HAPPINESS BY MANUFACTURERS IN 
THE HISTORY OF THE POLL, WHICH 
IS A REALLY OLD POLL. 
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ARE THE 
LOWEST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN 
44 YEARS. 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-
AMERICANS IS AT THE LOWEST 
LEVEL IN HISTORY. 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR HISPANIC 
AMERICANS, THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 
HISTORY. 
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN, AND 
I'VE BEEN SAYING IT HAS JUST 
CHANGED TODAY, IS AT THE LOWEST 
LEVEL -- AND I'VE BEEN TELLING 
YOU 21 YEARS. 
IT IS NOW AT THE LOWEST LEVEL 
IN 65 YEARS AND IT IS GOING TO 
BE IN HISTORY VERY SOON. 
HISTORY SOUNDS EVEN BETTER. 
FOR THE WORKERS, AFTER 20 
YEARS, WAGES ARE RISING. 
REMEMBER I USED TO SAY THEY DID 
BETTER 20 YEARS AGO THAN THEY 
DID TWO YEARS AGO. 
NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO DO 
BETTER. 
AND THEY'RE HAVING THEIR CHOICE 
OF JOBS WHERE THEY CAN ENJOY 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 
A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT 95% 
OF MANUFACTURERS THEY WANT TO 
GET GOING. 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET GOING. 
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE 
THINGS HAPPENING IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
BUT TO ME THIS IS ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE THE SPECIAL ONE. 
BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT ARE HIGHLY 
SOPHISTICATED, BUSINESS PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE COME OUT -- LOOK, I 
HAD A FRIEND COME OUT TWO WEEKS 
AGO BECAUSE HE HEARD ABOUT IT. 
HE IS A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED 
BUSINESS PERSON THAT YOU ALL 
KNOW. 
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. 
HE CALLED ME UP. 
AND HE WOULD LOVE TO TELL ME, 
IT IS NOTHING. 
HE'S THAT KIND OF A GUY. 
NOT REALLY A NICE GUY. 
BUT HE IS A GREAT BUSINESSMAN. 
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT HE IS 
SEEING. 
WE ARE DEMANDING FROM FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES, FRIEND AND FAUX -- 
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE LOST OUR 
COMPANIES. 
WE HAVE LOST OUR JOBS. 
THEY BUILD A PRODUCT, THEY SEND 
IT IN. 
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO 
BEAUTIFUL. 
BECAUSE THIS IS AS GREAT AS 
THERE IS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
AND WE DO IT WITHIN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
AND I JUST WANT TO LET YOU 
KNOW, WE PUT TARIFFS ON STEEL 
AND ALUMINUM. 
THOSE BUSINESSES ARE THROUGH 
THE ROOF. 
U.S. STEEL CALLED ME UP. 
THEY'RE EXPANDING OR OPENING 
SIX PLANTS. 
THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN 35 
YEARS. 
GEORGETOWN STEEL IN SOUTH 
CAROLINA CLOSED FOUR YEARS AGO. 
CLOSED AND SHUTTERED. 
THEY'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 
600 PEOPLE THAT. 
IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY. 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 
SO I WANT TO LEVEL OUT AND I'M 
DOING IT, LEVEL OUT THE PLAYING 
FIELD. 
AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU 
HEAR, SOME -- I MEAN, FRANKLY 
THE SMART PEOPLE LOVE IT. 
SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND 
IT. 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE TREATED 
FAIRLY WHEN OUR GREAT FARMERS 
IN IOWA, WISCONSIN, UPPER NEW 
YORK STATE, WHEN WE WANT TO 
SELL OUR DAIRY PRODUCTS INTO 
CAN BE DA, THEY CHARGE US 275%. 
275%. 
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 
IS WE DON'T WANT YOUR PRODUCT. 
BECAUSE WHO IS GOING TO PAY 
THAT? 
SO WE'RE GOING TO LEVEL OUT THE 
PLAYING FIELDS, FOLKS. 
THEY SEND US A LOT OF STUFF. 
NO TAX. 
WE'RE GOING TO WORK IT OUT. 
IT IS GOING TO BE FRIENDLY. 
WE LOVE CANADA. 
I LOVE CANADA. 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ITOUT. 
MEXICO, LAST YEAR MADE A 
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS PLUS 
THEY HAVE A 17% ALMOST VAT TAX 
THATY ABOUT. 
SO WE WERE BEHIND THE 8 BALL 
BECAUSE THAT TAX WAS THERE AT 
THE BEGINNING. 
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WE 
WERE BEHIND THE 8 BALL. 
MEXICO WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL. 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH 
A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
CHINA, I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT  
I THINK IT IS GREAT. 
AND THE PRESIDENT IS GREAT. 
HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE. 
BUT WE LOST $500 BILLION OVER 
THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. 
$500BILLION A YEAR. 
WE'VE HELPED REBUILD CHINA. 
SOME DAY THEY WILL SAY THANK 
YOU. 
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT 
ANYMORE. 
WE WANT TO HAVE A FAIR AND 
BALANCED SITUATION. 
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN 
IMMEDIATELY. 
BUT IT HAS TO BE FAIR. 
BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS NEVER 
DONE BETTER THAN IT IS DOING 
RIGHT NOW. 
EUROPEAN UNION LAST YEAR TRADE 
IMBALANCE, WE HAD A DEFICIT OF 
$151 BILLION. 
THEY SEND US MERCEDES. 
THEY SEND US BY THE MILLIONS 
THE BMWs. 
CARS BY THE MILLIONS. 
WE SEND THEM A BUSHEL OF CORN 
AND THEY REJECT IT. 
THEY DON'T WANT OUR CORN 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR 
FARMERS. 
OKAY I UNDERSTAND. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT OUR 
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT, WE DON'T 
WANT YOUR CARS. 
IT IS NOT A COMPLICATED 
FORMULA. 
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND 
SAY LET'S TALK. 
FRANKLY DON'T TELL THEM I SAID 
IT BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE. 
DON'T EVER TELL THEM I SAID 
THAT. 
IT WILL SCREW UP MY 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND IT WILL WORK OUT. 
MANY, MANY OTHER CASES. 
WE ACTUALLY MADE A DEAL WITH 
SOUTH KOREA. 
WE TOOK THE DEAL. 
I EXPIRED IT. 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DEAL. 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE US 
250,000 JOBS DONE BY HILLARY 
CLINTON. 
SHE WAS RIGHT, IT DID GIVE 
250,000 JOBS. 
SO SHE WAS RIGHT. 
IT GAVE IT TO SOUTH KOREA. 
NOT TO US. 
THIS WAS NOT A GOOD DEAL. 
BUT WE HAVE RENEGOTIATED THE 
DEAL. 
AND SUBJECT TO SIGNING -- I 
ALWAYS SAY SUBJECT TO SIGNING 
BECAUSE LOTS OF THINGS HAPPEN. 
AND IF IT DID HAPPEN, THAT'S 
FINE. 
BUT WE MADE A NEW DEAL WITH 
SOUTH KOREA. 
WONDERFUL DEAL FOR BOTH. 
AND OUR FARMERS NOW ARE 
PROTECTED. 
AND OUR TARIFF WHICH HAS BEEN 
PAID FOR YEARS WHICH WAS 
EXPIRING HAS NOW BEEN EXTENDED 
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR 
TRUCKS. 
AT THE CENTER OF AMERICA'S 
ECONOMIC RESURGENCE ARE THE 
MASSIVE TAX CUT THAT'S I SIGNED 
INTO LAW SIX MONTHS AGO. 
WE SLASHED TAX RATES FOR 
INDIVIDUALS AND WE DID NUMBERS 
FOR BUSINESS. 
WE DID TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF WORK. 
AND IT IS THE LARGEST TAX CUT 
EVER APPROVED, EVER GOTTEN IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM. 
INCLUDED IN THERE IS THE 
LARGEST DRILLING SITE 
POTENTIALLY IN THE WORLD AND 
ALASKA. 
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE WHICH IS GOING TO BE 
GREAT FOR THE PEOPLE HERE AND 
THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE. 
IN OTHER WORDS, WE GOT RID OF 
OBAMACARE'S INDIVIDUAL MANDATE 
WHERE YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF 
PAYING A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOT 
HAVING TO BUY HEALTH CARE. 
THINK OF THAT. 
THINK OF THAT ONE. 
YOU PAY A LOT OF MONEY NOT TO 
HAVE HEALTH CARE. 
SO IT'S GONE. 
MOST UNPOPULAR PROVISION IN 
OBAMACARE BY FAR. 
AND OBAMACARE IS LARGELY GONE 
NOW. 
AND WE'RE OPENING UP 
UNBELIEVABLE HEALTH KARA CROSS 
STATE LINES. 
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. 
REALLY GREAT HEALTH CARE. 
EVERYONE IS COMPETING FOR IT. 
ALL OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES 
ARE DYING TO GET IT. 
THEY ALL WANT TO COMPETE. 
THE COSTS WILL BE LOW. 
IT IS COSTING OUR COUNTRY 
NOTHING. 
NOTHING. 
IT IS BETTER THAN ANY FORM OF 
INSURANCE. 
WE HAVE ASSOCIATION AND THEN 
SECRETARY AZAR IS COMING OUT IN 
THREE WEEKS WITH A MASSIVE 
PLAN. 
WE DID REPEAL AND REPLACE 
OBAMACARE. 
ONE SENATOR DECIDED TO PUT THE 
THUMB DOWN LATE IN THE MORNING. 
AND THAT WAS NOT A GOOD THING 
WHEN HE PUT THAT THUMB DOWN. 
BUT WE HAVE MADE UP FOR IT. 
AND IN MANY WAYS MORE THAN MADE 
UP FOR IT. 
BUT THAT WAS A SAD DAY TO ME. 
BUT WE REPELLED AND REPLACED. 
NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT 
ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO BE 
BETTER. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO. 
TODAY WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS 
OF THE PRO-AMERICANA AGENDA. 
AMERICA FIRST. 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
ALL THOSE HATS. 
GREATEST PHRASE EVER USED IN 
POLITICS, I SUSPECT. 
RIGHT? 
THE GREATEST. 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
WHAT ARE WE USING IN TWO AND A 
HALF YEARS. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE TWO AND A HALF 
YEARS. 
SO SOON. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THE PHRASE IS, 
RIGHT? 
HUH? 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
OF COURSE EXCLAMATION POINT. 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T SAY MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE 
DOING, IT IS VERY SIMPLE. 
IT IS CALLED KEEP AMERICA 
GREAT. 
WE WILL GET YOU NICE HATS. 
MAYBE WE WILL MAKE THEM GREEN 
THIS TIME INSTEAD OF RED. 
GREEN. 
REPRESENTING CASH. 
THIS PLANT WILL MANUFACTURE 
STATE OF THE ART LCDs, ADDING 
AN AVERAGE OF $3.4 BILLION TO 
THE STATE'S ECONOMY EVERY 
SINGLE YEAR. 
AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW 
THIS BUT I UNDERSTAND LIFE AND 
I UNDERSTAND POLITICS, I GUESS 
-- OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE IN A 
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 
I MUST HAVE POTENTIAL, RIGHT. 
BECAUSE HERE WE ARE ALL 
TOGETHER. 
BUT I ASSUME THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
PROBABLY SAYING NO DEAL IS ANY 
GOOD. 
ANY DEAL YOU DO -- YOU KNOW, 
THE DEMOCRATS AS HEADED BY 
NANCY PELOSI AND MAXINE WATERS. 
THAT IS OUR NEW LEADER. 
ANY DEAL YOU MAKE, THEY HAVE NO 
IDEA WHAT THE DEAL IS. 
WE HAD A COUPLE OF THEM 
RECENTLY, A TRADE DEAL AND ONE 
OF THE DEMOCRATS GOT UP, THE 
DEAL DOESN'T WORK. 
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THE DEAL. 
NOBODY EVER TOLD HIM. 
WE DIDN'T KNOW THE DEAL BECAUSE 
WE HADN'T EVEN NEGOTIATED IT 
YET. 
BUT HE WAS SAYING THAT'S -- 
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. 
THEY WILL ALWAYS CRITICIZE. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT DEALS 
EVER. 
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO. 
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT 
ANYBODY IS CRITICAL OF IT. 
I DON'T IMAGINE THEY COULD BE. 
I KNOW THAT TERRY IS INVESTING 
$10 BILLION IN THE STATE. 
$10BILLION. 
INCREDIBLE. 
SO EVEN AT THIS EARLY STAGE, 
THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THIS 
NEW PLANT ARE BEING FELT IN 60 
OF WISCONSIN'S 72 COUNTIES. 
ALREADY. 
DON'T WORRY. 
IN ANOTHER THREE WEEKS, IT WILL 
BE 72. 
FOXCONN HAS ALREADY CONTRACTED 
27 LOCAL WISCONSIN COMPANIES TO 
BEGIN CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAIN 
FACILITY. 
AS BIG AS THIS IS, THIS IS JUST 
A TOY COMPARED TO THE MAIN 
FACILITY. 
AND I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT 
FOXCONN INTENDS TO BUILD 100% 
OF THE FACTORY WITH BEAUTIFUL 
AMERICAN CONCRETE AND BEAUTIFUL 
AMERICAN STEEL MADE RIGHT HERE. 
SO IMPORTANT. 
OUR STEEL INDUSTRY, OUR 
ALUMINUM INDUSTRY, OUR SOLAR 
PANEL INDUSTRY, IT IS ALL 
COMING BACK. 
COMING BACK FAST. 
ONE OF THE MANY PEOPLE HERE 
WITH US TODAY WHO WILL BENEFIT 
FROM THIS PLANT IS CECILIA 
GRIFFIN. 
SHE IS A MEMBER OF THREE AND A 
MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
UNION OF OPERATING ENGINEERS 
LOCAL 139. 
CECILIA. 
COULD YOU COME UP. 
TELL US WHAT THIS FOXCONN JOB, 
THIS INCREDIBLE -- THIS REALLY 
INCREDIBLE PLANT HAS DONE FOR 
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. 
CECILIA. 
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. 
THANK YOU. 
HELLO, EVERYONE. 
>> HELLO. 
>> GIVE AN HONOR TO GOD. 
I STARTED IN 2005 AS AN 
OPERATING ENGINEER. 
AND HANDCUFF MAN GAVE ME -- 
HOFFMAN CONSTRUCTION GAVE ME MY 
FIRST HAUL JOB IN A TRUCK. 
I WENT ON FROM THERE TO WORK 
FOR GEAR BAIN BUILDING THE 
NORTHWEST MUTUAL TOWERS IN 
MILWAUKEE. 
NOW THE TWO FAMILIES ARE 
TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT 
ME TO FOXCONN TO WORK IN THE 
HAUL TRUCK AGAIN. 
AND ME AND MY FAMILY ARE 
GRATEFUL AND VERY PLEASED TO BE 
AT HOME AGAIN. 
THANK YOU, EVERYONE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, CECILIA. 
AND WE WANT TO TELL, BY THE 
WAY, HARLEY DAVIDSON, PLEASE 
BUILD THOSE BEAUTIFUL 
MOTORCYCLES IN THE USA, PLEASE. 
OKAY. 
DON'T GET CUTE WITH US. 
DON'T GET CUTE. 
THEY DON'T REALIZE THE TAXES 
ARE COMING WAY DOWN. 
THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT YET. 
SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM. 
BUILD THEM IN THE USA. 
YOUR CUSTOMERS WON'T BE HAPPY 
IF YOU DON'T. 
I'LL TELL YOU THAT. 
NOW LET'S HEAR FROM DAWN 
WALLACE AFTER SHE AND HER 
HUSBAND DAVE WORKED HARD TO 
RAISE THREE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. 
DAWN RECENTLY DECIDED TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW JOB 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT FOXCONN 
CREATED RIGHT HERE IN 
WISCONSIN. 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE -- CAN 
YOU COME UP, PLEASE? 
WHERE ARE YOU? 
GOOD. 
HI, DAWN. 
HI. 
>> SO DID YOU RECEIVE ANY OF MY 
TWEETS, PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
>> I DID. 
>> YOU DID. 
>> I DID. 
>> STAY AT HOME MOM TURNED INTO 
FOXCONN BUILDER. 
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK 
HOFFMAN FORGIVING ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO START SOMETHING 
NEW. 
WHAT A PERFECT WAY TO MEET 
FOXCONN. 
I WAS SUPER EXCITED WHEN I 
HEARD IT WAS COMING IN OUR 
AREA. 
>> GOOD JOB. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
>> GOOD JOB. 
GOOD JOB. 
THANK YOU, DAWN. 
>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME 
CHRIS COSKI, ONE OF THE PROJECT 
MANAGERS OF THE SITE WHO HAS 
DONE A GREAT JOB. 
CHRIS, PLEASE. 
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY. 
SO ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF MY 
JOB IS GETTING TO PUT THESE 
TEAMS TOGETHER. 
IT IS ONE THING TO BUILD THEM. 
IT IS ANALYTICAL. 
WE LOOK AT PICTURES AND WE MAKE 
THEM INTO THE REAL THING IN THE 
REAL WORLD. 
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT, I NEED 
CURRENTLY 110 PEOPLE TO HELP ME 
EVERY DAY. 
AND THEY SHOW UP EARLY AND THEY 
GO HOME LATE AND WE SPEND TIME 
TOGETHER PROBABLY MORE TIME 
TOGETHER THAN WE SPEND WITH OUR 
FAMILIES. 
BUT THEY'RE THERE EVERY SINGLE 
DAY AND THEY DO EVERYTHING THAT 
WE ASK. 
AND WE GET THE JOB DONE ON 
TIME. 
AND THAT'S -- THAT'S THE PART 
THAT MAKES IT SPECIAL. 
SO WE GET TOGETHER OUT THERE 
EVERY DAY. 
AND WE MAKE SURE TO CARE FOR 
EACH OTHER, TAKE CARE OF EACH 
OTHER. 
WE ACTUALLY TREAT IT LIKE IT IS 
A FAMILY. 
IT IS A DANGEROUS JOB IN SOME 
WAYS. 
WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER. 
AND I JUST THINK THAT IT'S 
PROBABLY THE BEST THING. 
I HAVE REALLY BEEN DOING THIS 
SINCE I WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD. 
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M 
STANDING HERE TALKING TO YOU 
ALL TODAY ABOUT IT. 
FOXCONN IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE 
BEST THINGS THAT HAS EVER 
HAPPENED TO HOFFMAN 
CONSTRUCTION AND CERTAINLY FOR 
CHRIS COSKI. 
AND I APPRECIATE THE 
OPPORTUNITY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU, CHRIS. 
BY THE WAY, AS SOON AS I'M 
FINISHED HERE, I'M GOING TO HOP 
ON THAT PLANE AND I'M GOING 
BACK TO WASHINGTON AND WE'RE 
GOING TO PICK OURSELVES ONE 
GREAT UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE. 
TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A GREAT 
MAN JUSTICE KENNEDY REALLY A 
GREAT PERSON, GREAT MAN. 
I'M SO HONORED THAT HE DECIDED 
TO DO THIS DURING OUR TERM. 
AND I THINK THAT SHOWED 
CONFIDENCE IN US. 
BUT HE IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PERSON, SPECIAL MAN. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 
AND JUST REMEMBER THAT NAME. 
HE HAS DONE SOME VERY IMPORTANT 
DECISIONS, VERY IMPORTANT 
THINGS. 
HIGHLY RESPECTED. 
AND WE LOVE HIM. 
SO WE WILL -- BUT WE WILL BE 
PICKING SOMEBODY AND WE WILL BE 
HOPEFULLY MAKING YOU VERY 
PROUD. úSO IMPORTANT. 
YOU KNOW WHEN I RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT, I STARTED HEARING 
OUTSIDE OF OBVIOUSLY DEFENSE 
AND ALL OF THAT THE MOST 
IMPORTANT DECISION A PRESIDENT 
CAN MAKE IS THE PICKING OF 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES. 
IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO DO 
THAT. 
WE HAD A FANTASTIC CHOICE WITH 
JUSTICE GORSUCH. 
VERY PROUD OF IT. 
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND DO 
JUST AS GOOD. 
SO WE'RE GOING TO START WORKING 
ON THAT PROCESS. 
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED. 
AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO 
MAKE YOU VERY PROUD. 
SO JUST IN FINISHING, I WANT TO 
SAY THAT TODAY'S GROUND 
BREAKING IS ONLY ONE PART OF 
THE EXCITING STORY PLAYING OUT 
ACROSS OUR NATION, ALL OVER OUR 
NATION. 
CHRYSLER IS SHIFTING PRODUCTION 
FROM MEXICO TO MICHIGAN. 
TOYOTA AND MAZDA WILL BUILD A 
NEW FACILITY IN ALABAMA. 
BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. 
AND WE HAVE MANY OTHER 
COMPANIES COMING. 
NOT ONLY THE CAR COMPANIES. 
BUT THIS IS WHERE THE ACTION 
IS. 
I GO AROUND AND I SEE THE 
LEADERS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 
AND THEY ALWAYS SAY 
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GREAT 
ECONOMIC SUCCESS THAT YOU'RE 
HAVING IN THE UNITED STATES. 
AND WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT IS 
ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE OF CHINA. 
AND MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OTHER. 
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK WE'VE 
MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS IN THE 
LAST YEAR AND A HALF. 
IT HAS PUT US IN THIS POSITION. 
AND WE'RE GOING UP. 
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING 
LIKE IT. 
WATCH THOSE GPD NUMBERS. 
WE STARTED OFF AT A VERY LOW 
NUMBER. 
AND RIGHT NOW WE HIT A 3.2. 
NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE 
N FOUR YEARS. 
BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO A 
LOT HIGHER THAN THAT. 
SO YOU WATCH THOSE NUMBERS. 
EACH POINT IS THREE TRILLION 
DOLLARS AND 10 MILLION JOBS. 
JUST REMEMBER THAT. 
EACH POINT. 
AND WE ALREADY HIT A 3.2. 
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE 
SEEING 4s. 
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE 
SEEING 5s. 
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO 
HIGHER THAN THAT. 
BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE SECOND 
TERM. 
OKAY. 
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE BREAK. 
RIGHT? 
RIGHT, STEVE? 
OUR SECRETARY. 
OUR GREAT SECRETARY OF THE 
TREASURY. 
RIGHT, STEVE? 
THAT'S MY PREDICTION. 
I THINK THAT'S YOUR PROJECTION 
TOO. 
STEVE MNUCHIN. 
THAT IS HIS PROJECTION. 
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT, STEVE. 
IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS 
YEAR, AMERICAN COMPANIES $300 
BILLION THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER 
COME BACK TO THIS COUNTRY. 
IT IS OVERSEAS PROFITS, 
BRINGING THE MONEY BACK HOME TO 
OUR COUNTRY WHERE IT BELONGS. 
I THINK WE WILL HAVE THREE, 
MAYBE FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS 
BEFORE THAT WAS OVER. 
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING THE 
MONEY BACK FOR A LOT OF 
REASONS. 
NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK. 
IN FACT APPLE AS YOU KNOW TERRY 
MAKES A LOT OF THE PRODUCT, 
LAPTOPS, IPHONES. 
MAKES A LOT OF THEM FOR APPLE. 
AND APPLE IS SPENDING $350 
BILLION -- BILLION. 
THERE'S ANOTHER CASE. 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH 
350 MILLION. 
BUT THEY'RE SPENDING 350 
BILLION ON PLANTS ON BUILDING 
AN INCREDIBLE CAMPUS. 
AND TERRY IS HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 
WE'RE ALSO RECLAIMING OUR 
COUNTRY'S PROUD MANUFACTURING 
LEGACY. 
THAT'S WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT 
THAT WE OPEN UP OUR STEEL MILLS 
AGAIN. 
WE NEED THAT FOR PURPOSES OF 
DEFENSE. 
WE NEED THAT FOR PURPOSES OF 
LEGACY. 
WE'RE RESTORING AMERICA'S 
INDUSTRIAL MIGHT. 
THANKS TO THE HARDWORKING 
PATRIOTS LIKE YOU, WE'RE MAKING 
AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER 
BEFORE. 
IT IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. 
VERY SHORTLY IT IS ALL 
HAPPENING. 
YOU SEE IT HAPPENING. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. 
THEY'RE ALL COMING BACK TO THE 
PLACE THEY WANT TO BE. 
TO FOXCONN AND TO TERRY AND TO 
ALL OF THE AMAZING WISCONSIN 
WORKERS WITH US AND ALL OVER 
THE STATE, I WANT TO WISH YOU 
GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATULATIONS 
ON TRULY ONE OF THE EIGHTH 
WONDER -- I THINK WE CAN SAY 
THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD. 
THIS IS THE EIGHTH WONDER OF 
THE WORLD. 
THIS IS SOMETHING SO SPECIAL. 
I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ALL. 
YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE AND 
A VERY SPECIAL STATE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU TO SCOTT WALKER. 
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 
GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. 
GOOD LUCK. 
ENJOY THIS GREAT FACILITY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESS PEOPLE 
AT MOUNT PLEASANT, WISCONSIN. 
WHAT HE CALLED THE EIGHTH 
WONDER OF THE WORLD. 
THAT IS THE FOXCONN FACTORY 
THAT IS OPENING THERE. 
FOXCONN OF COURSE IS A 
MANUFACTURER OF TECHNOLOGY 
GADGETS, IPHONES, BLACKBERRIES, 
SONY, ANYONE TEN DA. 
A TAIWANESE COMPANY. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID HIS ROLE WAS 
CRITICAL IN BRINGING FOXCONN TO 
ME. 
HE SAID IF IT WASN'T FOR ME, 
THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE. 
HE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND IN 
THIS ADDRESS, RANGING FROM 
TRADE TO JUSTICE KENNEDY'S 
RETIREMENT. 
HE -- HE DIDN'T SPARE ANY WORDS 
TALKING ABOUT HARLEY DAVIDSON. 
HE TOLD HARLEY NOT TO BE CUTE. 
HE SAID DON'T GET CUTE WITH US. 
DON'T GET CUTE. 
WE'RE
