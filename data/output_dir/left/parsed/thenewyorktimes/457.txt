I want safety for my kids.
I mean that's why my son's here
today it's because we're
educating him that you know
you never pick up a firearm
and you never point it at
anybody unless you know what
you're going to do with it.
The Second Amendment crowd
you know we as Americans,
we as free Americans
have definitely expressed
our feelings via
the ballot box.
You came through for me,
and I am going to
come through for you.
