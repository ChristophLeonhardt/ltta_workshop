they're going after Norm Macdonald you know I've referred to norm on this show before he's my favorite living comedian I know he's the favorite comedian of a lot of people out there too and you know you can go down a YouTube wormhole of all the norm clips and the reason we're talking about norm now is he's getting a show on Netflix in I think two or three days I think it's airing either this week or next week and so the left is already trying to get him now it norm it's not like he's some Brooks Brothers wearing conservative it's not like you know he's this right-wing apologist or something he's just not politically correct and he's a comedian who cares about actually making people laugh unlike men net unlike Kathy Griffin I'm like people who they go for claps and not laughs norm actually goes for laughs and so they're so angry at him because he isn't politically correct because he isn't making jokes about Trump because jokes about Trump are super duper lame he did this interview yesterday or two days ago with The Hollywood Reporter where he was asked what do you think about Roseanne Barr and louis c.k both of whom are friends of his going back decades I believe and he said well you know they were really broken up about the whole thing and they're really sorry and I'm I'm glad to see them back on their feet something to that effect and they are pillory him for this he made a comment he said that the me2 movement got a little bit crazy and so he's glad that there's some balance you know that because of their look there were false accusations some of the people who were accusers are now being accused of sexual harassment themselves some of the people who were accusers have details have come out where they were in consensual relationships not non-consensual relationships so he's just pointing out that it maybe got a little out of hand and it's glad that it's not as crazy as it was before he is being raked over the coals they're already trying to cancel his show there were actually people tweeting who said I hate his show it's boring and terrible the show hasn't premiered yet and all I look I like norm so I want to defend his show and I look forward to watching the show but what this is really about is all of the hysteria that is gripping all of America we're all so trigger-happy for those of you who are not familiar with norm just to give you a little context here is a joke he did on David Letterman's last show I think you'll understand why he's such a favorite on this program here is one country that worries me though not Iraq not Iran not North Korea the only country that really worries me is the country of Germany I don't know if you guys are history buffs or not but in the early part of the previous century Germany decided to go to war and who did they go to war with the world had never been tried before and so you figure that would take about five seconds for the world to win but it was actually close then about that about thirty years pass and Germany decides again to go to Oran again it chooses as its enemy the world and this time they have that guy strike actually that guy I'm not even gonna dignify him by saying his name but I think you know like that but you think at that point the world will go listen Germany here's the deal you know ya be a country no more on account of you keep attacking the world so you get the sense we've we've talked about similar things before on this show with due respect to our German viewers and listeners so anyway the left is very upset because he's not being mean to trump or he's not telling this joke or that joke he's actually telling jokes just that are funny you know and that you're not allowed to do that anymore were than Anette comedy world now
