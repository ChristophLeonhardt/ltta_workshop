Vanity Fair contributing editor friendly wits has been observing Donald Trump's moves in New York City for decades she knows more about Donald Trump than most of the political reporters who've only been covering him for a couple of years now and she said something very important about Donald Trump this week that we should always keep in mind in every Trump story every story about the current president the United States in an interview with a British newspaper Fran Lebowitz said everyone says he is crazy which maybe he is but the scarier thing about him is that he is stupid you do not know anyone as stupid as Donald Trump you just don't and Donald Trump proves that every time he says this I'm like a really smart person I have like a very very high aptitude and intelligence I know words I had the best words I went through the Wharton School of Finance great schools great brain trust me I'm like a smart person no smart person has ever said any one of those things so when Donald Trump gets caught doing something very very stupid he always has to publicly pretend that it's the right thing to do even when he privately realizes that it wasn't the right thing to do and so today the Los Angeles Times reports the president Trump was privately furious today all day just furious that his White House leaked the fact that he was specifically told warned do not congratulate before he made a phone call to Vladimir Putin yesterday and congratulated Vladimir Putin for winning the rigged election for President of Russia Putin himself of course rigged the election by jailing his strongest opponent and other things something Donald Trump no doubt would like to have the power to do the Trump White House leaked leaked that in the briefing materials given to Donald Trump before the phone call it said in capital letters do not congratulate now there's more than one possible reason while Donald Trump then congratulated Vladimir Putin but one of the possible reasons that's always present in everything that all Trump does is what Fran Lebowitz said about him the scarier thing about him is that he is stupid and that is very scary deeply scary because that would mean that even a well-intentioned version of Donald Trump could make colossal and deadly mistakes as president of the United States The Associated Press is reporting Trump has told confidants that he believes the leak was meant to embarrass and undermine him said White House officials so Donald Trump thinks the leak was meant to embarrass him but how could it embarrass him if congratulating Vladimir Putin was the right thing to do the smart thing to do it could not embarrass Donald Trump unless unless after the fact Donald Trump realized how wrong it was to congratulate Vladimir Putin for winning an election rigged by Vladimir Putin it could got embarrassed Donald Trump unless after the fact Donald Trump realized that congratulating Putin made Donald Trump look stupid and incompetent and possibly a partner of Vladimir Putin or a servant of Vladimir Putin a collude er with Vladimir Putin so while Donald Trump spent the day infuriated and embarrassed by the leak that he that he was warned do not congratulate he had to publicly pretend to be proud of the thing that we know privately embarrasses him and so he tweeted I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past Obama called him also the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him they are wrong the LA Times is reporting quote one person who speaks regularly with White House officials said the most recent leak seemed particularly geared toward infantilizing Trump who has ignored numerous suggestions that he rebuked Putin and I'm pretty sure there's going to be a scalp over this so who's going to be fired for this leak how is the leakiest White House in history going to catch the person or persons who are responsible for this particular leak we now know that all of the white house leakers have signed a completely ridiculous and unenforceable confidentiality agreement that they violate every time they leak something it was the Trump family's idea to force White House staff to sign non-disclosure agreements Ivanka Trump was a big cheerleader for that idea it was a profoundly stupid idea carried into the Trump White House from the Trump family business in all the reporting on Donald Trump's furious embarrassment today every account stresses as the LA Times put it White House chief of staff John F Kennedy infuriated on a warpath according to the person in close contact with national security officials John Kelly is of course on the suspect list for this leak if not suspect number one he does leak to the press John Kelly does speak off the record to the press John Kelly is unprofessional and incompetent when he speaks to the press John Kelly has lied to the press and been caught in those lives John Kelly has told reporters completely inappropriate things like exactly where in the bathroom Rex Tillerson was sitting when John Kelly told him on the phone that he was fired the president is probably not entirely right when he tells people that the leak was meant to embarrass him the leak was also meant to remove the embarrassment from the White House staff the embarrassment that the President of the United States congratulated Vladimir Putin for winning the election that Vladimir Putin rigged most people working in the Trump White House have no idea how wrong it is for Donald Trump to congratulate Vladimir Putin for winning the election that Vladimir Putin raped does the White House believe that the election in Russia was free and fair in terms of the election there were focused on our elections we don't get to dictate how other countries operate what we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country and that's not something that we can dictate to them how they operate we can only focus on the freeness and the fairness of our elections there is no publicly available evidence that she is even 1% smarter than that answer but some other people in the White House are and they were no doubt embarrassed and infuriated that Donald Trump did congratulate Vladimir Putin after he was told not to and so and so they probably wanted to put the stain of that embarrassment where it belongs which is entirely on Donald Trump and they wanted to send the signal to the rest of us and to the world that not everyone on the Trump White House thinks Vladimir Putin should be congratulated for winning a fraudulent election and that's a good thing to know we are better off tonight knowing that not everyone in the White House is in Putin's pocket and there was only one way to communicate that through this leak now in my experience in government I found that people who leak are often the ones who pretend to be the most infuriated about the leak so John Kelly trying to get the word out to every reporter in every newspaper that he's infuriated about the leak makes him no less a suspect and another likely suspect is of course Donald Trump himself who we know is constantly complaining to people outside the White House on the phone about his White House staff and it is entirely possible that Donald Trump himself told several people but they actually wrote do not congratulate on his notes and that one of those people for many of those people might be among the leakers of this information the weakness of that theory of course is that Donald Trump actually read any of the words that were written for him in his briefing materials before getting on the phone with Vladimir Putin because Donald Trump famously does not read the president reportedly made the call to Vladimir Putin not from the Oval Office where these calls are usually made surrounded by experts and advisers he made the call from the White House residence and it is not yet clear who if anyone was actually present during the phone call for those details we might have to wait for the next Michael wolf book or the next book like Michael Wolf's book that will be lavishly supplied with leaks from all of those people who signed all those trump non-disclosure agreements in the White House hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
