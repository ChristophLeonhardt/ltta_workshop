1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
joining me now CNN national security
analyst James clapper the former

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,379
Director of National Intelligence so
good to have you on sir good evening to

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,280
you director clapper there have been so
many developments in this Russian

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,849
investigation and I want to ask you
first about new information it was first

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,420
reported in the New York Times tonight
that special counsel Muller is asking

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,260
the White House for documents directly
related to the president's actions and

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,949
behavior while in office how do you read
what Muller is asking for well first on

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,250
I don't have any inside baseball in a
this so I'm just drawing inferences like

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,070
everyone else is and some extent this
reminds me that metaphor about lots of

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,670
blind people touching the elephant and
trying to describe the elephant I would

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:52,050
say though that it appears to me that
the the scope of the investigation is

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,270
broadening and deepening as the requests
for information as they have been

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,030
reflected in the media reporting seems
to be getting more and more pointed and

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,810
more and more specific so I don't you
know I don't know where this is all

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,130
going to lead I don't know if you know
this is implicating the president or not

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,979
but well that's going to ask you does
this mean the president could be the

17
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,979
central focus of Muller's probe well
it's again the inference you could draw

18
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:32,790
is that he is but you know I don't know
that I would say and I've said this some

19
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,640
time ago when former director Muller was
first appointed to the position of

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,659
Special Counsel that if there is in his
estimation there was no there there he'd

21
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,810
say so it appears at least from what's
going on there is there there and I

22
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,579
don't exactly know where this is going
to lead but I'll also repeat something

23
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,729
I've said on more than one occasion is
that it is so critical that that this

24
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,038
whole process whether in the Congress or
certainly the investigation of Special

25
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:18,489
Counsel come to a conclusion
is then transparently explained to the

26
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,900
American people
CNN also has some exclusive reporting

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,840
involving Paul Manafort president
Trump's former campaign chairman

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,170
specifically that investigators got a
FISA warrant to wiretap manna port

29
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,260
before and Manta Ford before and after
the election what's your reaction to

30
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:40,720
that well I can't comment on specific
fire order I said some things about this

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:49,360
on Meet the Press on the 5th of March
and I stand on on that statement I can't

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,989
I can't confirm or deny
I just sir let me play it and then get

33
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,079
your just to remind people of what you
said and this is what you said to Chuck

34
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,680
Todd this was back in March and as you
said on Meet the Press and then we'll

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,480
finish up let me start with the
president's tweets yesterday this idea

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,620
that maybe President Obama ordered in
illegal wiretap of his office's if

37
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,069
something like that happened would this
be something you would be aware of I

38
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,200
would certainly hope so I can't say
obviously I'm not I can't speak

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,459
officially anymore but I will say that
for the part of the national security

40
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:31,359
apparatus that I oversaw as DNI there
was no such wiretap activity mounted

41
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,930
against the president the
president-elect at the time or as a

42
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:42,280
candidate or against his campaign I
can't speak for other title 3 authorized

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,930
entities in the government or a state or
local and I was just gonna say if the

44
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,470
FBI for instance had it fights a court
order of some sort first surveillance

45
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,819
would that be information you would know
or not now yes you would be told that I

46
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,900
would know that if there was a FISA
Court order on something like this

47
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,540
something like this or absolutely and at
this point you can't confirm or deny

48
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,060
whether that exists or I can deny it
there is no FISA Court order not not to

49
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,010
my knowledge of anything at Trump Tower
no okay so the the president's allies

50
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,120
say that the fact that man afford was
wiretap proves that the president was

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,450
right to accuse a former president of
wiretapping him and you were wrong

52
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:25,870
what's your response well I again I I
stand on that statement that you just

53
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:33,300
replayed and I cannot comment on the
media reporting which is all we have

54
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:42,340
about a FISA warrant allegedly lodged
against mr. manna for I I can't comment

55
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,600
on that I will simply reiterate what I
said in March and I stand on that yeah

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,210
and that there is as far as Trump Tower
being wiretapped according to the

57
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,840
president you're you say what I stand on
what I said on the 5th of March on Meet

58
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
the Press as you just replayed it okay
so did you know and I had to keep just

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,280
wanting just for clarity because there's
been a lot of reporting on this right

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,270
and people on on on you know especially
those supporters of the president saying

61
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,139
oh here's proof here's proof so did you
know about a FISA warrant against Paul

62
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,570
Manafort at the time I did not you did
not okay you know I and again I have to

63
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:30,400
say that what we have is media reporting
only and actually commenting on you know

64
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,560
faces are classified and so you know
even if I knew something about it I

65
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,810
couldn't and I don't and I again I will
just conclude by saying I stand on what

66
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,700
I said on the 5th of March is it
possible the president was picked up in

67
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:52,360
a conversation with Paul Manafort it's
it's certainly conceivable yeah is that

68
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,229
likely I can't say I I wouldn't want to
go there but it I will say it's it's

69
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,460
it's possible okay the Washington Post
is also reporting tonight that that

70
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,370
while Paul Manafort was working for
Donald Trump

71
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,880
he offered to privately brief a Russian
oligarch Oleg Deripaska on the campaign

72
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,630
how would the Russians interpret that
mr. clapper well obviously a you know

73
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:30,010
perhaps a they would regard it perhaps
as a winning accomplice again as part of

74
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:37,120
their overall campaign to interfere with
the election so if they had a a way

75
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,389
witting and willing
participant who would engage with them

76
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:48,620
talk to them who in their mind had some
inside access or influence in the

77
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,090
campaign which at one point mr. man
afford certainly did I think they would

78
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,909
view that as a a favorable line of
exploitation I have to ask you about the

79
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:03,199
meeting the President had with the in
the Oval Office with Russian Foreign

80
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,069
Minister Sergey Lavrov and the former
ambassador circuitously act where a

81
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,909
president Trump bragged about firing
Comey to the Russians saying it relieved

82
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:14,990
great pressure on him people on both
sides of the aisle grasped at these

83
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,370
pictures or gasp I should say that these
pictures do you think that that moment

84
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:26,419
will come back to haunt President Trump
well it could it's not to say that that

85
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:33,379
such meetings are not are inappropriate
I I personally was somewhat taken aback

86
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,189
by that from from if no other point of
view there's just the security

87
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:42,560
standpoint in light of the fact that
only Russian media media were permitted

88
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,000
in the Oval and only Russian
photographers were allowed to take

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:58,180
pictures so I just they were closely
screened and just the the notion of this

90
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:06,159
solicit solicitousness with the Russians
has been for me at least bothersome

91
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:09,819
particularly in light of the

92
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:17,270
demonstrated interference in in our in
our election and it's appearing more and

93
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,990
more to me that the intelligence
community assessment that we published

94
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,250
in the 6th of January may have only been
perhaps the tip of the iceberg

95
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,199
can I ask I just want to go back to and
get your response to something because

96
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,849
in September 2nd this president's own
Justice Department said that there was

97
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,610
no evidence to support the president's
claim that President Barack Obama

98
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,289
offered wiretapping of trump tower
during the 2016 presidential campaign

99
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,550
again as his Justice Department said in
a new court filing wouldn't the Justice

100
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,510
Department his Justice Department know
about if there was a fire suffice a

101
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,670
warrant if there was any sort of
wiretapping

102
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,700
on Trump Tower yes absolutely and I
believe director Comey said much the

103
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,110
same thing in his testimony on March
16th before the House Select Committee

104
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,410
for intelligence so the president's own
Justice Department came to the

105
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,840
conclusion after investigating that
there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower

106
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,740
but that's that's what that's that's
what I draw from that yes

107
00:09:15,740 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank You mr. Clapp I appreciate it
thanks Don
