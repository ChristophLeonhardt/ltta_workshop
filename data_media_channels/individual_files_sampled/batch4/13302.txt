did you think that yesterday's news cycle was going to be the pinnacle of insanity did you think that we had really reached the apex of crazy and hilarious with Elizabeth Warren revealing a test that supposedly showed that she was Native American only to show that she is significantly less Native American than a Jeep Grand Cherokee were you a person who thought you know maybe we finally reached the summit of ridiculousness with Elizabeth Warren claiming that she was a member of the Cherokee Nation when in fact Elizabeth Warren is whiter than this piece of paper did you think well you ain't seen nothing yet it's 2018 gang boom so President Trump leads off this morning and he had a bunch of tweets about Elizabeth Warren we'll get to those in just a second but we begin we begin with the President of the United States who has decided that he doesn't like stormy Daniels anymore our producer Sonia is down with illness but we'll make a Taylor Swift reference for her here it turns out they are never ever ever getting back together so here is what happened there's a lawsuit that stormy Daniels had filed against the President of the United States he was always a frivolous stupid lawsuit anybody with a law degree knew this and there's a suit in which she sued him for defamation after he tweeted that she was engaged in a total con job and she he tweeted a sketch years later about a non-existent man a total con job playing the fake news media for fools this is when she claimed that she was stalked by a guy who was sent by Trump and she sued him for defamation okay that's not information she's a public figure defamation is knowing and knowingly and maliciously attacking someone false information it's knowing and malicious is the standard for public figures it wasn't knowing and it wasn't malicious it was just basically free speech in him giving an opinion but she sued him for defamation and then it was thrown out the case was thrown out and here's what the judge wrote the court agrees with mr. Trump's argument because the tweet in question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United States the First Amendment protects this type of rhetorical statement not only that the judge ruled that stormy Daniels now had to pay Trump's legal fees ouch so the President of the United States had a had a response on Twitter remember this is an office once occupied I Abraham Lincoln George Washington Ronald Reagan here's the President of the United States official statement on his Twitter account quote federally judge throws out stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees great now I can go after hers face and her third-rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she would confirm the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total con well that's one way to step on a news cycle so we could have done an entire week of Elizabeth Warren now we will do an entire week of the presidents of the United States calling a woman he once had sex with horseface yeah so that's a thing now a couple of different things to note here first of all if you had to sum up this entire is entire news cycle in one meme it would be President Trump as The Lone Ranger silver would be horse face stormy Daniels and Tonto would be Elizabeth Warren so our artistic geniuses in the back room are cooking up that one right now but with that said is it good that the President of the United States calls any woman horse face no probably not a good thing is it smart that he calls a woman he once had sex with horse face well it does call into judgment it does call into question his judgment regarding women it's kind of a weird thing to do like you have sex with a woman you're not married to and then you call her horse face is that more of a rip on her or rip on your taste because it's kind of weird also just politically speaking is that gonna make for a good news cycle that now we're gonna get media outraged about Trump calling woman horse face like a week and a half after the Brett Kavanaugh saga in which the left wanted to launch a war on women and failed is that gonna be good no but no one ever accused the president of not stepping on his own mushroom so it's really it's it's it's not great I'll be honest with you I think that there are flaws in this in this line of thinking then when the president got up this morning he thought you know what I'm gonna tweet about Shirley Daniels and her horse days I host the other away Dylan Dylan Dylan tendon um yeah not great not great
