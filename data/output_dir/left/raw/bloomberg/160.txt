BATTERIES.

23
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,108
THEY CAN NOW COVER UP TO 315

24
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:42,842
MILES ON A SINGLE CHARGE.

25
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:47,046
ALSO APPEALING TO SPORTS CAR

26
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,181
ENTHUSIASTS SAYING THE IMPROVED

27
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,382
MODEL WOULD BE UP TO ACCELERATE

TO 60 MILES AN HOUR ZERO IN 2.5

29
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,053
SECONDS.

30
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:53,720

31
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,420
SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE NEW

32
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,690
FEATURES IS DAVID WELCH FROM OUR

33
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,925
AUTO TEAM IN DETROIT.

34
00:00:58,925 --> 00:00:59,626
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS

35
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,096
ANNOUNCEMENT?

36
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:03,863
DAVID: WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT

37
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,666
TODAY IS MARGINAL AND KIND OF

38
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,835
INCREMENTAL, BUT THERE IS SOME

39
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,737
SIGNIFICANT MARKETING NEWS.

40
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,806
HE CAN SAY HE'S GOT THE FIRST

41
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,141
CAR THAT CAN GO OVER 300 MILES

42
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:15,975
ON A SINGLE CHARGE AND BRAGGED

43
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,912
THAT THE MODEL S IS GOING TO BE

44
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:20,747
THE FASTEST CAR IN THE WORLD YOU

45
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,048
CAN BUY AT RETAIL.

46
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:22,882
IT IS GOING TO BEAT FERRARI AND

47
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:27,053
PORSCHE AND IT IS AN ELECTRIC

48
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:27,420
CAR.

49
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,187
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW, THIS IS

50
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:28,955
GOOD NEWS THAT HE CAN BOAST

51
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,793
ABOUT AND PROVE TO THE WORLD

52
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,061
THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN GO TOE TO

53
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,131
TELL.

54
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:38,731
-- GO TOE TO TOE.

55
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,935
EMILY: LET'S TALK ABOUT

56
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,936
AUTOPILOT -- LOTS OF QUESTIONS

57
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,905
GIVEN THE INVESTIGATION GOING

58
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,041
INTO THE FATAL CRASH.

59
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,076
GOOGLE AND ALPHABET THING THEY

60
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,046
ARE FOCUSED ON FULLY SELF

61
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,148
DRIVING CARS AND NOT

62
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:55,982
SEMI-AUTONOMOUS CARS LIKE TESLA

63
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,684
IS WORKING ON.

64
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,852
WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT

65
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:02,122
AUTOPILOT?

66
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,125
DAVID: HIS BIGGEST NEWS IS HE'S

67
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:06,893
GETTING BETTER BATTERY POWER.

68
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:12,131
THEY CONTINUE TO WORK ON

69
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:12,799
AUTOPILOT AND THEY ARE

70
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,434
CONTINUING TO RATE TEST IT SO

71
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,301
THAT IT IS READY FOR PEOPLE TO

72
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,672
USE DOWN THE LINE WITHOUT HAVING

73
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,708
THEIR HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

74
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,542
PEOPLE HAVE TO KEEP THEIR HANDS

75
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,210
ON THE WHEEL WITH AUTOPILOT AND

76
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,748
IT'S NOT FULLY AUTONOMOUS.

77
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,549
NO ONE HAS WON ON THE ROAD THAT

78
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,183
IS FULLY AUTONOMOUS YET.

79
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,585
EMILY: INTERESTING NEWS COMING

80
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,456
FROM DELPHI AND MOBILIZE WHO SAY

81
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,392
THEY ARE TEAMING UP TO CREATE AN

82
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,861
ENTIRE SELF DRIVING SYSTEM.

83
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,628
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AND HOW

84
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:44,697
WOULD IT WORK?

85
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,266
DAVID: THIS COULD BE

86
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:55,908
SIGNIFICANT.

87
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:58,311
THE ISRAELI COMPANY MAKES

88
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,112
SENSORS AND CAMERAS AND MAPPING

89
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,415
CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR SELF

90
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,149
DRIVING CARS ARE GETTING

91
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,016
TOGETHER AND IT'S GOING TO BE A

92
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,885
LOWER TAX SYSTEM.

93
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,454
IT'S GOING TO BE A CAMERA ACED

94
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,489
SYSTEM WHICH IS A LITTLE --

95
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,327
CAMERA BASED SYSTEM AND THEY MAY

96
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,128
BE ABLE TO GET CARS TO MARKET

97
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:15,795
FASTER THAN A LOT OF BIG

98
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,031
COMPANIES ARE TALKING ABOUT.

99
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,667
THE OTHER SIGNIFICANCE IS

100
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,468
SMALLER COMPANIES LIKE SUBARU

101
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,670
AND MAZDA, THOSE THAT DO NOT

102
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,972
HAVE THE BIG BOX TO PUT INTO BIG

103
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,508
SELF DRIVING PROGRAMS LIKE

104
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,245
GENERAL MOTORS OR GOOGLE, THEY

105
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,012
COULD ACTUALLY GET A CRACK AT

106
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,280
THIS TECHNOLOGY.

107
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,181
IT IS ALMOST AN OPEN SOURCE

108
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,049
VERSION.

109
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,186
EMILY: WOULD THIS BE A ONE-STOP

110
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,121
SHOP FOR SELF DRIVING CARS?

111
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,992
DAVID: IT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY

112
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:46,826
WILL DO BUSINESS WITH ANYONE WHO

113
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,227
WANTS TO USE THEIR WHITMAN AND

114
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,128
GET IT ON THE ROAD QUICKLY.

115
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,964
EMILY: DAVID WELCH JOINING US

116
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,833
FROM DETROIT.

117
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,771
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT OF A.

118
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,572
SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO

119
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,942
FOLLOW -- FOR THAT UPDATE.

120
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:04,677
LAST WEEK, WE FOUND OUT

121
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,246
PITTSBURGH IS UBER'S CITY OF

122
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,149
CHOICE WHERE THEY WILL RIDE

123
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:21,827
SPECIALLY FITTED VOLVO SUVS THAT

124
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:22,628
WILL BE SUPERVISED BY HUMANS IN

125
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,362
THE DRIVERS SEAT FOR THE TIME

126
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:23,696
BEING.

127
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,564
I SAT DOWN WITH THE CITY'S MAYOR

128
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,331
AND ASKED WHEN HE FIRST STARTED

129
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:25,898
SPEAKING WITH UBER.

130
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:26,299
 SUVS THAT

131
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,066
WILL BE SUPERVISED BY HUMANS IN

132
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,568
THE DRIVERSGUEST: THE INITIAL CS

133
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,402
HAPPENED ALMOST 18 MONTHS AGO.

134
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,136
TRAVIS AND HIS TEAM HAD THEN

135
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:34,106
LOOKING FOR A CITY TO CREATE AN

136
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,208
INNOVATION CENTER FOR AUTONOMOUS

137
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,910
VEHICLES.

138
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,644
THEY STARTED TALKING WITH

139
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:41,214
CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY AND

140
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,483
OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST SIX

141
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,685
MONTHS, WE'VE BEEN ADVANCING THE

142
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,386
DRIVERLESS CARS IN LIMITED AREAS

143
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:49,455
OF THE CITY AND OVER THE COURSE

144
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,191
OF THE PAST FEW WEEKS, WE TOOK

145
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,661
IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL TO

146
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,129
ACTUALLY CALL IT UP ON YOUR APP

147
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,798
AND USE IT ON AUTONOMOUS

148
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,666
VEHICLES.

149
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,636
EMILY: WHY DO YOU WANT

150
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,939
PITTSBURGH TO BE THE GUINEA PIG?

151
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:07,874
IT'S EXCITING BUT IT IS ALSO

152
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,341
UNPROVEN.

153
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,745
GUEST: IT IS AND IT ISN'T.

154
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,816
FOR OVER A DECADE, PITTSBURGH

155
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,617
HAS BEEN USING DRIVERLESS CARS

156
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,952
AND UBER HAS IN ALL OVER THE

157
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,453
CITY WITH IT.

158
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,621
I GOT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO

159
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,858
USE THE VEHICLE ITSELF, ENDING A

160
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,327
NIGHT BY HAVING TRAVIS AND HIS

161
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,160
TEAM PICKED ME UP AND TAKE ME

162
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,528
HOME.

163
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,798
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN A CAR

164
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,233
AND AT THE SAME TIME, SAFETY IS

165
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,068
COMING FIRST.

166
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,271
IT WILL ALREADY HAVE A DRIVER IN

167
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,105
THE DRIVER SEAT.

168
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,141
THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN

169
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,978
THEREFORE SOMETIMES AND THIS HAS

170
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,846
BEEN THE TIME TO TAKE IT TO THE

171
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,246
STREETS.

172
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:51,217
EMILY: HAVE YOU TOLD THEM?

173
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:55,555
GUEST: THIS IS AN ISSUE WE HAVE

174
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,389
BEEN WORKING WITH NOT JUST WITH

175
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,291
UBER BUT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

176
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,695
TRANSPORTATION.

177
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,496
SECRETARY FOX AND HIS TEAM, ONE

178
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,263
OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE WORKED ON

179
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,566
IS CYBER SECURITY.

180
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,366
UBER IS USING A LOT OF CYBER

181
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:11,371
SECURITY EXPERTISE.

182
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,105
THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

183
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,274
PUTTING REQUIREMENTS THAT LOOK

184
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,343
AT SAFETY FIRST.

185
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,112
WHETHER IT IS INOCULATIONS,

186
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,114
WHETHER IT WAS AVIATION OR NOW

187
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:25,485
WITH MOBILITY AND AUTONOMOUS

188
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,354
VEHICLES, THERE'S ALWAYS A TEST

189
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,724
TIME AND IT HAS POSITIVES AND

HOW DID YOU DO IT?

312
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,994
SAM: WE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON

313
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:15,527
PROFITABILITY.

314
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:16,161
WE WANTED TO OWN OUR OWN

315
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,664
DESTINY.

316
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,465
WE WERE IN A CLIMATE THAT WAS

317
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,232
CHANGING FAST AND DRAMATICALLY

318
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,067
FROM FUNDRAISING AND WE WERE

319
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,703
ABLE TO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY AND

320
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,071
THEN WE SAW THAT PULLBACK.

321
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,074
WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO OWN OUR

322
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,177
OWN DESTINY AND MAKE THAT THE

323
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,314
SOLE FOCUS OF THE COMPANY.

324
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,716
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE FOCUS AND

325
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,186
FROM THAT CAME A TON OF TACTICS

326
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,321
WHICH WE COULD SPEND HOURS

327
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:48,760
TALKING ABOUT.

328
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,595
WE REDUCED ALLIANCE ON COUPONS

329
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,631
AND DISCOUNTING.

330
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,465
HOTELS GIVE US ROOM THAT WOULD

331
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,803

00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,506
ABSOLUTELY.

335
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,009
WE WOULD SUPPLEMENT THAT FOR

336
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,379
TRYING HOTEL TONIGHT AND THE

337
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,581
PRODUCT STOOD ON ITS OWN.

338
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,150
WE DID NOT HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT

339
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,586
DISCOUNT AND WE WERE JUST

340
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,220
CANNIBALIZING THE EXISTING

341
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,523

342
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,725
GROWTH CONTINUED AND IN MANY

343
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,292
CASES ACCELERATED.

344
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,561
EMILY: DID YOU END UP

345
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,663
FUNDRAISING?

346
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,599
SAM: WE DID NOT NEED TO.

347
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:31,703
WE HIT IT IN APRIL AND WE WERE

348
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,672
ABLE TO ANNOUNCE PUBLICLY THAT

349
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,675
WE ACHIEVED THAT GOAL.

350
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:41,413
EMILY: YOU SAY YOU ARE PLANNING

351
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,181
TO GO PUBLIC BY THE END OF THE

352
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:42,581
NEXT YEAR.

353
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,515
WALK ME THROUGH THE NEXT 12

354
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:49,187
MONTHS OR SO.

355
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:49,988
SAM: I TALKED TO OUR ADVISORS

356
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,691
AND WOULD -- SAID WHAT IS THE

357
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,761
NEXT GOAL?

359
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,033
ALWAYS ONE TO GO PUBLIC AND HAVE

360
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:01,867
A COMPANY I STARTED AND TAKE IT

361
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,002
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

362
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:10,508
THAT'S WHEN I WAS 22 YEARS OLD.

363
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:11,443
I'M PERSONALLY VERY MOTIVATED BY

364
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,947
THAT AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A

365
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:15,681
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE FOR THE

366
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,281
TEAM TO GO THROUGH.

367
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,351
THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP FOR

368
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,185
CONTROLLING OUR DESTINY AND WE

369
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,920
THINK WE CAN GET THERE BEFORE

370
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,554

371
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,791

375
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,233
ABOUT THIS?

00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,437
PUBLIC ONE DAY, THE INFORMATION

378
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,372
IS GOING TO BE SHARED THAN OR AS

379
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,474
WE GET CLOSE TO GOING PUBLIC IS

380
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,208
EVEN MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE

381
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,477
SHARING RIGHT NOW.

382
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,313
I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT

383
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:51,517
EVEN THOUGH WE WENT THROUGH SOME

384
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,317
DIFFICULT TIMES, WE ARE THRIVING

385
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:54,486
RIGHT NOW.

386
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,989
WE DID NOT DO THAT AT THE

387
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,123
EXPENSE OF GROWTH.

388
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,324
WE HAVE A GREAT PIPELINE COMING

389
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:04,630
OUT OF THE FALL, SO I LOVE TO

390
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,299
TALK ABOUT IT AND IT'S FUN TO

391
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,469
TALK ABOUT AND BRAG ABOUT THE

395
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,978
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO A SALE?

INNOVATION.

00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:41,266

408
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,405
EMILY: EXPEDIA AND PRICELINE

409
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,039
DOMINATE THE MARKET.

410
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,607

411
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,876

00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,779
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN

413
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,384
MAKE IT AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

WE ARE ACTUALLY A WEEK IN

MARKET OPPORTUNITY RIGHT THERE.

420
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,162
AND WE ARE MOBILE ONLY.

421
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,830
THAT CUTS THE MARKET DOWN

422
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,199
CONSIDERABLY.

423
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,069
THE OTHER GUYS SELL CRUISES AND

424
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,107

SEE THEM COME BACK OVER AND OVER

431
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,393
AGAIN EVEN THOUGH GROSS BOOKINGS

432
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,327
WE HAVE ARE SMALLER, OUR

433
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,162
MARKETING COSTS ARE FAR SMALLER

434
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:44,630
THAN THEIRS.

435
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,232

436
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,268
OTHER STARTUPS THAT MAY BE IN

437
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,536
THE POSITION YOU WERE SIX MONTHS

438
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,272
AGO?

439
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,607
SAM: WHEN I LOOK BACK ON IT, I

440
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,308
THOUGHT IT WAS A MUTUALLY

441
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:00,679
EXCLUSIVE DECISION.

442
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,480
WE AS A TEAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN

LEVERAGE TO PULL BACK IF NEEDED?

448
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,496
IT WAS NOT A BINARY DECISION.

449
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,330
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WE LOOK

450
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,465
AT TOGETHER.

451
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,400
IF A COMPANY IS LOOKING THAT

452
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,268
WAY, THEY WILL BE POSITIONED FOR

453
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:23,702

504
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,326
NOT BIGGEST CAUSE OF DELAYS.

505
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,929

VERY RELIANT ON THEIR COMPUTERS

515
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:35,253
CAN BE DEVASTATING.

516
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,054
EMILY: WHY IS THE TECHNOLOGY

517
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:41,826

518
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:46,798

520
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,033
IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTER CRASH, IT

THE AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM, IN SPITE

524
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:56,875

00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,610
SOPHISTICATED, INTERLOCKING

526
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,015

527
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:04,883
IT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE IF YOU

528
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:10,021
CONSIDER WHAT IT DOES AND ITS

529
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:10,822
SAFETY RECORD, WHICH IS REALLY

530
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:11,222
AMAZING.

YEARS.

534
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,528
SO THAT IS IN THE BACKDROP OF

535
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,331
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

536
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,332
THE RELIABILITY IS QUITE

537
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:20,799
AMAZING.

538
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,803
EMILY: DELTA IRONICALLY HAS THE

539
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:25,937
BEST ON-TIME RECORD OF ANY

540
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,141
CARRIER.

541
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,476
SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED THAT

542
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,210
SAFETY WAS IN QUESTION WITH

543
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,677
THESE ISSUES?

544
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,913
ALAN: I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

545
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,916
QUESTION THAT SAFETY WAS

546
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,851
COMPROMISED WITH THE COMPUTER

547
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,521
OUTAGE.

548
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,288
THE REASON THEY ARE PUTTING

549
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,122
THEIR PLANES ON THE GROUND IS TO

550
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,258
BE CAUTIOUS.

551
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,192
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A CONCERN

552
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,760
AND IT IS WORN OUT WHY THE

553
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,962
ACCIDENT STATISTICS WE SEE

554
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:55,200

555
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,068
COMPARED TO 20 OR 30 YEARS AGO.

556
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,571
RELIABILITY IS ANOTHER QUESTION

557
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,307

AT HERE.

559
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:09,314
EMILY: WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?

560
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,148
WHAT ARE AIRLINES DOING AND WHAT

561
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:10,849
ARE THEY GETTING BETTER AT?

562
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,083
ALAN: THE DATA WE LOOKED AT

563
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,086

564
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,322
AIRLINES HAVE EXCEEDED THOSE

565
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,123
CAUSED BY WEATHER AND THAT SORT

566
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,124
OF THING.

567
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,693
IT DOESN'T SHOW WHAT HAS CAUSED

568
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,262
THE ACCIDENT, WHICH IS A LITTLE

569
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,132
TRICKY TO TALK ABOUT.

570
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,234
YOU HAVE A GROUP OF COMPANIES

571
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:29,901
THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH

572
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:30,669
BANKRUPTCIES AND HAVE CUT COSTS

573
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,239
AND STAFF, HAVE LOWERED THE

574
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,073
SALARIES OF A LOT OF THEIR STAFF

575
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:40,145
AND I THINK WHAT THAT HAS DONE

576
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,181
IS CUT INTO THE RELIABILITY OF

577
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:43,815
SOME OF THEIR SYSTEMS.

578
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,185
THE WAY TO IMPROVE THAT IS TO

579
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,822
ADD EXTRA AIRCRAFT SO IF ONE

580
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,357
AIRCRAFT ARRIVES LATE, YOU CAN

581
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,024
THROW IN A SUBSTITUTE.

582
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,728
THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE

583
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,262
SUBSTITUTE.

584
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,463
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THEY CAN

585
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,297
DO TO TRY TO SPEED THINGS UP.

00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,897
EMILY: GIVE ME SOME COLOR ON

753
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:53,264
THAT.

754
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,834
GUEST: ADVERTISING ON REDDIT IS

755
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,270
DIFFERENT THAN ELSEWHERE YOU

756
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,071
IT'S THE LIFE BECAUSE YOUR

757
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:00,872
INTERACTIONS ARE DIFFERENT.

758
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,607
AND ADVERTISER ELSEWHERE ONLINE

759
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:06,210
OR OFF-LINE, THEY ARE YELLING AT

760
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,246
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

761
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,013
YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY YOUR

762
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,648
MESSAGE IN THE FLASHES THEM

763
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:11,315
LOUDEST WAY POSSIBLE.

764
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,885
ON REDDIT, YOU CAN MAKE A

765
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,686
GENUINE CONNECTION.

766
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,888
IT'S MORE AKIN TO SPEAKING TO A

767
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:21,225
CUSTOMER IN THEIR HOME.

768
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,360
WHEN AN ADVERTISER EMBRACES THAT

769
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,127
IN SPEAKS TO THEIR CUSTOMER

770
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,594
AUTHENTICALLY, YOU CAN GET A

771
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:25,161
REAL CONNECTION.

772
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:28,099
EMILY: HERE'S ANOTHER -- ARE YOU

773
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,536
WORRIED ABOUT COMPETITION?

774
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:33,337
REDDIT HAS GONE UNCHANGED AND

775
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,005
UNOPPOSED FOR A DECADE.

776
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,007
ARE YOU CONCERNED SOMEONE COULD

777
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,876
SWEEP AWAY NONCORE USERS THE

778
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:43,648
SAME WAY REDDIT DID TO DIGG IN

779
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,047
2010?

780
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:48,018
GUEST: WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON

781
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,288
PROVIDING A GREAT USER

782
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,791
EXPERIENCE -- WE WOULD NOT GO ON

783
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:54,625
SOME KIND OF FOOL THEIR UNLIKE

784
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,426
OTHER STARTUPS HAVE MADE IN THE

785
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:55,760
PAST.

786
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,229
EMILY: BUT THERE'S SO MUCH

787
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,165
COMPETITION -- EVERYTHING FROM

788
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,033
TWITTER TO FACEBOOK TO SNAPCHAT

789
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:02,366
-- 

790
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,569
GUEST: ONE OF THE BEST PIECES OF

791
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:06,370
ADVICE I WAS GIVEN EARLY IN OUR

792
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,974
NEAR -- IN OUR CAREER IS THAT IF

793
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:10,808
YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME LOOKING

794
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:11,609
IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR, YOU WILL

795
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,710
DRIVE INTO A WALL.

796
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,511
WE JUST LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF

797
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,813
REDDIT AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN

798
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:16,681
OUR GUIDING LIGHT AND HAS SERVED

799
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,081
AS WELL.

800
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,417
EMILY: LIKE MANY WEBSITES,

801
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:24,789
REDDIT'S I MARRY BUSINESS MODEL

802
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,489
IS BEING CHALLENGED BY AD

803
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:26,023
BLOCKING SOFTWARE.

804
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:26,791
WHAT IS GOING TO YOUR MIND AS

805
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,427
YOU BATTLE THIS SHIFT AND HOW TO

806
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,529
KEEP THE BUSINESS FORWARD FACING

807
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,499
AND AGILE?

808
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:40,271
GUEST: NEVER LOSE TRACK OF WILD

809
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,072
USERS ARE COMING TO YOUR SITE.

810
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,573
IF YOU START SACRIFICING THAT,

811
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,641
YOU WILL START HAVING A BAD

812
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,676
TIME.

813
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,845
ONE OF THE HUGE ASSETS WE HAVE

814
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:48,646
IS THIS IS THE ZEITGEIST FOR A

815
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,647
QUARTER OF A BILLION PEOPLE.

816
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:54,318
AND IT IS A BRAND POT STREAM

817
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,152
COME TRUE BECAUSE WORD-OF-MOUTH

818
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:55,920
IS THE MOST POWERFUL FORM OF

819
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,690
ADVERTISING.

820
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:05,763
EMILY: HOW DO YOU BALANCE BEING

821
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,564
TRUE TO THE USER AND NOT LETTING

822
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,399
THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL AND

823
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,234
TURNING THIS INTO A REAL

824
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:10,701
BUSINESS?

825
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,502
THAT HAS BEEN THE MAIN CHALLENGE

826
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,803
OVER THE LAST YEARS.

827
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:17,241
GUEST: YES AND NO.

828
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,142
THERE'S A WAY TO ADVERTISE ON

829
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,610
REDDIT THAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE RUM

830
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,012
THE USER EXPERIENCE.

831
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:22,713
LIKE WHEN YOU MAKE A REAL

832
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,248
CONNECTION.

833
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,082
CUSTOMERS EXIST BECAUSE THEY

834
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:29,120
NEED SOMETHING FROM THE BRAND.

835
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,357
THAT AND BE A POWERFUL THING.

836
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,225
WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN

837
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,760
DO THAT A WAY THAT DOESN'T

838
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,463
DISTRACT FROM THE PROJECT --

839
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:43,634
FROM THE PRODUCT.

840
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,202
SO THAT THEY ARE NOT AT THE

841
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,003
EXPENSE OF THE EXPERIENCE BUT

842
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,105
NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE GUEST:.

843
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,774
REDDIT IS IN A FORTUNATE

844
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,042
POSITION BECAUSE A BRAND LIKE

845
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:54,212
COCA-COLA CAN RUN AN AD ON

846
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,614
REDDIT AND DURING THE SUPER

847
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,817
BOWL, AND ADD ABOUT AN AD AND

848
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:05,589
ENGAGEMENT ON THAT WAS HIGHER

849
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:06,290
ENGAGEMENT THAN CONTENT ON

850
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,657
REDDIT.

851
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,693
THEY CAN MAKE A GREAT INVESTMENT

852
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,560
THAT THEY ARE ALSO MAKING A REAL

853
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,194
INFLUENCE.

854
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:17,768
EMILY: CONDE NAST. YOU GUYS IN

855
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,604
2006 AND SPUN YOU OFF IN 2011.

856
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,438
DO YOU WISH OVER THE LAST DECADE

857
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,473
THEY HAD HELP YOU BUILD UP THE

858
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:22,907
BUSINESS?

859
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:28,712
GUEST: IN A LOT OF RESPECTS,

860
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:29,180
THEY WERE.

861
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,880
WHEN WE SOLD THE COMPANY IN

862
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,716
2006, WE WERE BOTH 22.

863
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,516
WE DIDN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT

864
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,250
RUNNING THE BUSINESS.

865
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,754
AT THE TIME, I REGRETTED IT.

866
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,621
THIS THING KEEPS GROWING AND WE

867
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,522
DID NEED TO SELL.

868
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:42,092
BUT WHEN I REFLECT ON IT NOW,

869
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,127
THAT IT WAS A GOOD HOME FOR US

870
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,496
TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE BUSINESS

871
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,263
AND LEARN HOW TO MANAGE AND

872
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:52,202
GROW.

873
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:52,970
NOW THAT WE ARE INDEPENDENT

874
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,671
AGAIN, WE CAN BRING THOSE

875
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,138
LESSONS BACK.

876
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,473
I'M NOT CERTAIN REDDIT WOULD

877
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,675
HAVE SURVIVED WITHOUT IT.

878
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,444
IT'S NOT A SURE THING.

879
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,114
I THINK EVERYTHING PLAYED OUT

880
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:04,582
THE WELL.

881
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:08,352

882

REDDIT COFOUNDERS.

897

I KNOW YOU HAVE WORKED HARD TO

898
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,459
CHANGE THIS BUT DO YOU THINK

899
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,127
TROLLS ARE HUGE PROBLEM?

900
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:07,665
GUEST: IN THE LAST QUARTER,

901
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,532
WE'VE REDUCED SPAM BY 90% AND

902
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:09,033
ABUSE BY 30%.

903
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,269
EMILY: HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

904
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,606
IT'S DIFFICULT TO CRACK DOWN

905
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:19,577
WITHOUT PISSING PEOPLE OFF.

906
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:23,814

00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,718
ILLUMINATING IT.

00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,320
ABUSE, LETTING USERS BLOCK OTHER

910
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,088
USERS HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT.

911
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,557
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT WE

912
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:34,324

PERSPECTIVE, QUARTER OF A

00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,565
BILLION PEOPLE WILL HIT REDDIT

916
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:42,332
THIS MONTH, A POPULATION LARGER

917
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:43,901
THAN BRAZIL.

918
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,769
OF ALL THE CONTENT THEY ARE

919
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,037

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,641
REMARKABLE ENVIRONMENT.

923
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:55,212
EMILY: SOME OF THE CRITICISM

924
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:55,946
GOES BEYOND THIS -- THEY SAY

925
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,016
IT'S A WAY TO ORGANIZE TROLLS

926
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:03,020
AND SPREAD ACROSS THE INTERNET.

927
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,854
THIS IS WHAT ELLEN PAO TRIED TO

CRACK DOWN ON.

929
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,891

930
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:10,928
SHE DID ULTIMATELY LEAVE.

00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:27,878
SOME OF IT MORE DRAMATIC THAN

940
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,113
OTHERS.

941
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,914
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE SET THE

942
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:32,382
COMMUNITY WITH WHAT IS

943
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:33,317
ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT IS NOT, IT'S

944
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,719
BECOME EASIER.

945
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,587
IT'S ABOUT SETTING BOUNDARIES

946
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,488
AND ENFORCING IT CONSISTENTLY.

947
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,355
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME.

948
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:42,326
EMILY: IN THE WEEK LEADING UP TO

949
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,260
THIS, WE WERE TAKING QUESTIONS

950
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,730
ON REDDIT AND A LOT OF USERNAMES

951
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,431
WERE TOO OFFENSIVE TO USE.

952
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:51,635
SOME OF THEM INVOLVED MY NAME.

953
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:52,503
HOW ARE YOU MAKING REDDIT SAFER

954
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,405
FOR WOMEN IN PARTICULAR?

955
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,509
GUEST: IT IS A BIG THING ON OUR

956
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,511
MINDS NEAR CONSTANTLY.

957
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:04,148
OUR VISION IS TO MAKE REDDIT AS

958
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,950
USER-FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE.

959
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,953
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK WE'RE

960
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,753
DOING, CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH

961
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,420
THEIR HOME ON REDDIT.

962
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,556
IT'S NOT AN EASY PROBLEM, BUT I

963
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,258
THINK WE HAVE MADE STRIDES

964
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,993
TOWARD IT.

965
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:16,827
THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF WORK TO

966
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:17,261
BE DONE.

967
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,531
EMILY: AND IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN,

968
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,766
BUT MINORITIES AND ANYONE IS NOT

969
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,534
A STRAIGHT WHITE GUY.

970
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:27,771
GUEST: ACCORDING TO RECENT DATA,

971
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:32,576
49% OF REDDIT OR ARE WOMEN.

972
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,978
ONE OF THREE WOMEN WILL HIT

973
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:35,546
REDDIT THIS MONTH.

974
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,682
IT'S A LARGE AND DIVERSE

975
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,483
POPULATION AND WE ARE DOING A

976
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,785
BETTER JOB EVERY DAY.

977
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,188
WE DID NOT HAVE A TRUST AND

978
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,022
SAFETY TEAM ONE YEAR AGO AND WE

979
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,658
DO NOW.

980
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:49,593
IT'S MAKING SURE PEOPLE GET THE

981
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:50,327
SAFE EXPERIENCE THEY WANT.

982
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:51,729
GUEST: ONE OF THE LARGEST

983
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,864
WOMEN'S COMMUNITIES ONLINE IS ON

984
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:54,298
REDDIT.

985
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:58,736
EMILY: REDDIT HAS TAKEN SOME

986
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,872
STRONG STANDS ON THE MATTER OF

987
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:02,706
CONSUMER PRIVACY AND HAS BEEN A

988
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:03,273
LEADER IN THE FIELD.

989
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,107
WHAT BUSINESS CASE CAN YOU SHARE

990
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:05,642
THAT MAY CHANGE THE MINDS OF

991
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:08,779
THIS IS WHO HAVE NOT CAUGHT ON

992
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,546
TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSUMER

993
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,416
PRIVACY QUESTION MARK GUEST:

994
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,384
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ANY BUSINESS

995
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:15,219
TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH

996
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:15,719
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

997
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,155
FOR US, IT'S ABOUT MAINTAINING

998
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,990
TRUST WITH OUR USERS.

999
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:25,529
WE ALSO THINK IT'S VERY MUCH

1000
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:26,330
ABOUT MENA SITE -- MINIMIZING

1001
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,833
THE SURFACE AREA.

1002
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,601
WE DON'T REQUIRE E-MAIL

1003
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,068
ADDRESSES.

1004
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,270
IT UP FOR THE USERS TO SHARE

1005
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,139
WHAT THEY WANT.

1006
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,840
IF WE WERE TO GET ATTACKED BY

1007
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,077
THAT SORT OF THING, DON'T ASK A

1008
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:40,811
LOT, DON'T TAKE A LOT.

1009
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:44,348
DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THEM.

1010
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,849
THAT MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE

1011
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,286
FOR ANY COMPANY.

1012
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:56,193
EMILY: HERE'S ANOTHER ONE FROM A

1013
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,027
USERNAME THAT WE CANNOT SAY BUT

1014
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:57,761
THEY DO LISTEN TO BLOOMBERG

1015
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:58,095
RADIO.

1016
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,396
HOW DOES REDDIT CHECK THE

1017
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,466
BALANCE BETWEEN FREEDOM OF

1018
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,501
SPEECH AND PRIVACY?

1019
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:10,707
GUEST: I WOULD SAY THAT PRIVACY

1020
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,475
AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH ARE NOT

1021
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:11,909
CONFLICTED.

1022
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:12,743
PRIVACY IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

1023
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:13,544
ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT.

1024
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,916
WE BELIEVE ANYONE ON REDDIT

1025
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:19,650
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS

1026
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,183
THEMSELVES FULLY.

1027
00:45:20,183 --> 00:45:22,653
ON REDDIT, YOU CAN BE YOUR TRUE

1028
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:23,420
SELF AND THAT'S A POWERFUL

1029
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,790
THING.

1030
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,092
PEOPLE COME SEEKING RELATIONSHIP

1031
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:29,793
ADVICE OR HELP WOMEN HAVE

1032
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:30,560
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR COMING OUT

1033
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,629
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1034
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,463
THESE ARE POWERFUL THINGS PEOPLE

1035
00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:36,200
EXPERIENCE.

1036
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,867
WHEN IT COMES TO LAW

1037
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:37,701
ENFORCEMENT, WE HOLD A VERY HIGH

1038
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,037
BAR.

1039
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:40,904
WE MAKE SURE REQUESTS ARE VALID

1040
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,772
AND AUTHENTIC AND PUSH BACK WHEN

1041
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,974
THEY ARE NOT.

1042
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,808
IN FACT, WE DID THAT ABOUT ONE

1043
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,743
WEEK AGO WHEN WE WERE SUED BY

1044
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:50,080
ATLANTIC RECORDS FOR USER DATA.

1045
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,014
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE HAND OVER.

1046
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,850
EMILY: REDDIT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS

1047
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,688
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE INTERNET

1048
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,455
AND THE IDEA IS TO TURN THIS

1049
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,156
INTO A FULL-FLEDGED MEDIA

1050
00:45:59,156 --> 00:45:59,923
EMPIRE.

1051
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:04,895
YOU DELVE INTO ORIGINAL CONTENT.

1052
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,965
HOW ARE THOSE EXPERIMENTS GOING?

1053
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:12,302
GUEST: WELL SO FAR.

1054
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:13,003
WE HAVE DOUBLED DOWN ON

1055
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,672
PUBLISHER TOOLS AND WE REALIZE

1056
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,075
SO MANY PUBLISHERS, NEWSROOMS

1057
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,977
STARTING THE DAY READING THEIR

1058
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,546
BEATS ON REDDIT.

1059
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,581
IF YOU COVER SCIENCE, YOU ARE

1060
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,315
READING IT AND THEY TRIED TO

1061
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,817
TURN THAT IN TWO CONTENT A WOULD

1062
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,120
PUBLISH ON THEIR OWN SITE.

1063
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,422
BY EATING DOG FOOD OURSELVES, WE

1064
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,190
REALIZE THESE ARE THE TOOLS WE

1065
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,225
NEED TO BE BUILDING.

1066
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:39,196
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT BUILDS

1067
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:39,997
A RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE TO --

1068
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,166
PEOPLE WHO DO THE BEST JOB.

1069
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:46,169
EMILY: IN TWO YEARS, WHERE DO

1070
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:48,939
YOU SEE REDDIT? GUEST: WE SHOULD

1071
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:52,342
BE SIGNIFICANTLY BIGGER AND

1072
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:52,976
REVENUE SHOULD BE UP

1073
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:53,677
SIGNIFICANTLY AND I THINK WE

1074
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:54,478
WILL MAKE PROGRESS AGAINST THE

1075
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,080
BIGGEST PRODUCT -- BIGGEST

1076
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,484
PROBLEM WE HAVE -- HOW DO WE

1077
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,284
CONNECT FIRST-TIME USER WITH

1078
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:03,286
THEIR HOME ON REDDIT?

1079
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,521
I BELIEVE EVERY PERSON HAS A

1080
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,023
HOME SOMEWHERE ON REDDIT BECAUSE

1081
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:12,095
WE HAVE 45,000 ACTIVE

1082
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:12,796
COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW.

1083
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:13,663
THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY.

1084
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,633
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE ARE

1085
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:17,334
CHASING AFTER RIGHT NOW.

1086
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:23,006
GUEST: THE MAGIC BEHIND REDDIT

1087
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,775
LAYS IN THAT PSEUDONYMITY.

1088
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,442
YOU CAN REALLY BE YOUR.

1089
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:26,577
.

1090
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,546
YOU CAN TALK WORLD POLITICS,

1091
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:35,285
LEARN ABOUT COMMUNITIES AND THE

1092
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,553
KINDS OF CONNECTIONS PEOPLE MAKE

1093
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,121
ON REDDIT WILL BE AS STRONG OR

1094
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:38,989
STRONGER, I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE

1095
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,724
CONNECTIONS THEY MAKE ON OTHER

1096
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:44,728
SOCIAL NETWORKS.

DAYS UNDERWAY.

1107
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,575
REDDIT GOT ITS START AT THE

1108
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:15,445
INCUBATOR 11 YEARS AGO.

1109
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,581

TALK TO US ABOUT WHY, LATER'S

HOW INVOLVED HAVE THEY BEEN OVER

1114
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,427
THE COURSE OF THIS 11 YEARS?

1115
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:35,298
GUEST: YOU MENTIONED THAT PG DID

1116
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,434
REJECT US.

1117
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:43,907
JESSICA LIVINGSTON FOUGHT TO

EMILY: HERE'S A QUESTION FROM A

1122
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,684
REDDIT USER -- HOW DID THEY HELP

1123
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,853
YOU AND DO YOU STILL KEEP IN

1124
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:57,721
TOUCH?

1125
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,624
GUEST: IT HAS HELPED IN

1126
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,592
DIFFERENT WAYS BUT HE MET A LOT

1127
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:07,797
OF OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS THERE AND

1128
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:08,598
OUR CLOSEST BUSINESS CONFIDENCE

1129
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:09,532
WERE PEOPLE THAT WE MET, THE

1130
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:11,801
FOUNDERS OF WHICH WERE IN THAT

1131
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:13,937
BATCH WITH US.

1132
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:19,776
WE GREW UP TOGETHER AND WE

1133
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:20,543
LEARNED HOW TO HIRE, FIRE AND

1134
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:21,044
RAISE MONEY.

1135
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,980
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE

1136
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:30,153
EXPERIENCE TO HAVE.

1137
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,190
GUEST: ESPECIALLY IN 2005.

1138
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,959
THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF

1139
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:36,793
RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT GROUP

1140
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,095
IT PROVIDED TO SHARE NOTES WAS

1141
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,765
INVALUABLE AND EVEN MORE

1142
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,899
VALUABLE TODAY BECAUSE THE

1143
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:46,236
NETWORK IS SO MUCH BIGGER.

1144
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,071
YOU MAY NOT GET A RESPONSE

1145
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,508
INSTANTLY.

1146
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,477
IT JUST GETS STRONGER WITH EVERY

1147
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:53,910
BATCH.

1148
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:58,615
EMILY: PAUL GRAHAM HAS GIVEN A

1149
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,382
LOT OF ADVICE OVER THE YEARS.

1150
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,284
WHAT APPLIES AND WHAT DOESN'T

1151
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,286
MARK -- WHAT DOESN'T?

1152
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:08,291
GUEST: I'M NOT GOING TO GET IN

1153
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:12,896
WHAT -- INTO WHAT DOESN'T.

1154
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:13,730
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES

1155
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,566
OF ADVICE WE RECEIVED IS TO

1156
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:17,300
LAUNCH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

1157
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,034
BECAUSE UNTIL YOU LAUNCH, YOU

1158
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,470
ARE NOT LEARNING.

1159
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,540
IT'S A DAY YOU LEARN WHETHER

1160
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,008
YOUR IDEAS GOING TO WORK OR NOT

1161
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,176
SO HOW YOU HAVE TO CHANGE TO

1162
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:33,249
MAKE IT WORK -- I REMEMBER

1163
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:34,551
BEFORE WE STARTED CODING ON

1164
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,853
REDDIT AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE YOU

1165
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:37,620
SEE TODAY, BUT WE LEARNED SO

1166
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,656
MUCH JUST BY ITERATING.

1167
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,827
EMILY: HOW MANY COMPANIES WERE

1168
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,327
IN THE BATCH?

1169
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,629
EIGHT QUESTION MARK NOW THEY ARE

1170
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:48,898
FUNDING HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES

1171
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:49,766
AND THEY ARE SOMETIMES

1172
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,502
CRITICIZED AS A START UP COMPANY

1173
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,537
THAT VALUATIONS ARE OVERINFLATED

1174
00:52:54,537 --> 00:52:55,939
JUST BECAUSE THEIR NAME IS

1175
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:56,773
ATTACHED TO IT.

1176
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,910
GUEST: I WAS A PARTNER FOR A

1177
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,812
TIME THERE.

1178
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,781
THE BENEFIT OF THOSE THREE

1179
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:10,987
MONTHS IS A HUGE MULTIPLIER.

1180
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,455
WHEN YOU CAN CALL UP AND GET

1181
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,724
FEEDBACK AND GET SMACKED AROUND

1182
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,694
AND FOCUSED ON WHAT MATTERS, IT

1183
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,030
MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND

1184
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,598
THOSE VALUATIONS ARE A RESULT OF

1185
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:24,100
THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MUCH

1186
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,901
BETTER OFF.

1187
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,004
EMILY: HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION

1188
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,774
FROM REDDIT.

1189
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:31,608
WHEN WAS THE MOMENT YOU ALMOST

00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,076
GAVE UP AND WHAT OLD YOU

1191
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:33,543
THROUGH?

1192
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,446
GUEST: I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS

1193
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:37,981
THE MOMENT, BUT THERE ARE MANY

1194
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:38,982
MOMENTS.

1195
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,683
WHEN YOU ARE A FOUNDER,

1196
00:53:40,683 --> 00:53:43,887
ESPECIALLY FIRST-TIME FOUNDER,

1197
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,921
CHANNELING WHAT YOUR MOTIVATION

1198
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,556
IS.

1199
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,459
SOMETIMES IT DOING THE BEST

1200
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,660
THING FOR OUR USERS.

1201
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,695
SOMETIMES IT WAS NOT LETTING

1202
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:53,530
ALEXIS DOWN.

1203
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:58,001
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK STUPID.

1204
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:01,271
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW

1205
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,138
WHY YOU ARE WORKING.

1206
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:06,643
IT'S NOT ALWAYS UP TO YOUR

1207
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,177
MOTIVATION.

1208
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:07,977
IT'S NOT ALWAYS AM GOING TO

1209
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:11,314
CHANGE THE WORLD.

1210
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,782
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE AN UP,

1211
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:16,353
THERE'S A DOWN.

1212
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,821
YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO GET

1213
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,355

00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:19,789
