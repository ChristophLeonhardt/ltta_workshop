it's Friday on the beat and you know what that means it's time to fall back 97 the host of the top-rated morning show in the tri-state area he bro in the morning he bro Darden a pioneer in the hip-hop industry and host on beats 1 Peter Rosenberg also the host of open late and Laura styles host of the podcast improper etiquette they have interviewed everyone from fitty to cardi to the h-bomb that's hurt oh no to Bernie also the h-bomb Hillary Clinton in there somewhere you can also catch the 25th anniversary yeah hot 97 Summer Jam that's this week in congratulations you guys have a lot going on yeah it's your first takeover I'm glad you're here and let's get to it who needs to fall back I know everybody saw this video you have to have seen this video the FBI agent who decided to go to the club and start breakdancing he does a backflip forgets he has a gun in his pocket here is this is really so first of all Howard his moves you know he looks up they had blurred his face now but it would his face it used to be blurred Laura that face he makes after he knows he is crazy so you think he needs to fall back rather than doing shootings at a are you that wasn't part of the dance move right why wasn't the safety on the gun like why just pick it up he just press his gun to like squeeze and then yeah somebody got shot in the live heard of gun talk but this is gun safety talk as the great beet nuts once said take it or squeeze what would the al-bukhari know anyways I think the great beating that said you better watch your step well done you could do that and the awesome beat nerds or watch out now they also said that well then you're gonna have to go higher pitch if you're gonna do it mine I'm gonna start out with Fox News and is that like I don't want to start beef because I know we're on MSNBC so I don't any problems right there's my truth though they were so excited about the Donald Trump diss invitation to the Philadelphia Eagles that some producer was like I need to get footage of of eagles kneeling so they find some stock photos of eagles kneeling great here's the problem no Eagles kneel during the national anthem last year we were kneeling in prayer I don't know if you've ever seen a football game that's not where players line up during the national anthem it's actually pregame or after a touchdown and shout out to the great Chris Long and Zach Ertz who jumped on social media and they basically were like hey Fox News we need you to apologize to these good Christian men who were just doing their pregame prayers and you tried to accuse them of doing something they didn't even do Fox News fall there it is I heard you have a secret fallback it's not really a secret we're on your show and I think you need to fall back and not give you a guest homework you don't like you don't like homework it's it's a new show I could take a fall back on my fall back right there tell me do we have they're saying their salads video oh there's video huh roll tape roll it Ari you need to fall back you know why I'm coming on your show it's fallback Friday and you gave me homework the night before I was supposed to be there you fall back sir plus I have summer jam on Sunday I'll have time for your shenanigans whoa this is impressive audio-video skills that you like so that's a pre tape that turns into the you know what consider me fallen the are you member so this is a first on the beach yeah interestingly my fallback is an important topic that's been on the minds of a lot of people in hip-hop particularly people in the berg space of hip-hop and to give context to it i want you to go ahead and watch some video of your history with Drake Drake is yelling yes yes Drake yelled he was very passionate we have a weird relationship I told him I like you moving away I don't even get professional courtesy from you so when you go to do something if maybe there's a world in which I would have not thought of negative as negatively of the video had I not felt him been weird ten times previously but I'm a human being I tried the DMM and tell him privately if you don't give me an open line to tell you those things and I then go on the radio and say here's my opinion that's how it made me feel and then you call me and go how could you say that I would have told you that's how I felt Drake is known but my son is an emotional rapper we see that your relationship with him is emotional but he's an emotional regulator you're emotional radio host but we have a special special graphic here my fallback nominee is your emotional relationship with dress first of all and wear that photo with desire done and terrible fall back on you again for showing footage where I'm wearing the same shirt that I'm wearing can I get a free shirt rag-and-bone but listen we look at that shirt it's so sick we do have an up-and-down emotional relationship but listen Drake is Jewish I am Jewish Jews are emotional we feelings get hurt easily through sensitive even and we met very sensitive yeah we've had it happen many times now but I will tell you you know we're actually in a pretty good space right now I don't see why you're bringing up old stuff oh my god yes that's that's fair all right aggression well and it goes to something that's true in your field and it's true in journalism which is you're probably better at the job if you care about it but sometimes if you care too much you can lose your the sort of the judgment that also people rely on you for right yeah absolutely but the thing that we often or I try to say on the show all the time is on that on all the shows that I do I am NOT a journalist I am a I'm a broadcaster who tries to be entertaining and tell my opinions on music but you're not a promoter of various artists I'm not something else I'm in the middle but sometimes I am skewed and I tried to even in that conversation I said I know I'm being biased because he's hurt my feelings before but that is the least cool or tough thing I've ever said and there's a long list of not cooler tough things that I've said but I mean we're human beings right I mean it's your jobs different you have to get our caring believe this got into cool and tough when you got the same shirt on the judge wrap this up why didn't you tell me why didn't your producer who do I need to blame who set me up no one sets you up you're on the news and a lot of people come on these interviews shows Ebro and they don't get the topics in advance they got a rolls I know it's a good point but they can they get there I can say this that we've ever done ebrill Rosenberg Laura Styles and again from every Monday through Friday in New York 6:00 a.m. on 97 some exam this weekend throw throw this thing out terrible hey I'm already Melbourne from
