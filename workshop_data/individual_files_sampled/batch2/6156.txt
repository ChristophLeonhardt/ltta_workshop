the just Democrats are on to a very important progressive cause that I want to tell you about it is in regards to the budget showdown what we're saying is no dream no deal so if the DREAM Act is not included in this deal no Democrats to sign on to it if they do it'll be unbelievable Cavin and just when you thought the Democrats were fighting back if they came in on this it'll be the worst now luckily they're not some of them are fighting back I want to show you that right now now some people who are running for Congress some people who are already in Congress let's let's start that video I'm really I'm really new I'm Antoinette Sedillo Lopez I'm Alexandria ocassi of course Bezeq I'm a Justice Democrat a number justice Democratic wait what what is this rogue rahova legendary progressive in Congress justice Democrat we're coming so now I'm going to tell you more about no dream no deal and that's very important but if you don't know Roe Grijalva you need to and and I don't use the word legend loosely so let me give you a sense of who Grijalva is he's the of course the US Representative from Arizona's third District he's co-chair of the Progressive Caucus one of the most progressive members of Congress first vice-chair of the Hispanic Caucus vice-chair of the LGBT equality caucus co-sponsor of Medicare for all co-sponsor to make public college tuition free co-sponsor to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour co-sponsor of HR 771 to allow equal access to women's health and abortion coverage and health insurance and he has introduced HR 3 2 to 7 that only eliminates private prisons how much do I love this guy co-sponsor of HR 1 1 4 4 to add Wall Street speculation tax as progressive as it gets so it is a great honor to have the second income and Raul Grijalva join the Justice Democrats along with along with ROH Khanna there are now 37 just Democrats including 35 running for office as we speak some like Doug Applegate set to topple darrell Issa which is going to be a great great victory and many others that are leading in their races and we did not plan it this way just turn out this way 19 women 18 men 18 non-white candidates 19 white candidates that's real diversity and that's when you look for best of the best that's what you get so now back to what Grijalva cares deeply about and rightly so and what we all care about which is making sure that the the people that are now being threatened with basically eviction from this country the only country they've ever known imminently because of Donald Trump or the Republicans that we fight for them and that we win this is all about policy and about winning on policy so first of all go sign the petition Justice Democrats calm no dream no deal I don't know why every single Democrat wouldn't be on board for this how could you possibly give in to the Republican budget with nothing to return for it even after Donald Trump promised the DREAM Act and a compromise with Schumer and Pelosi he's now backed away from that but this should be absolutely non-negotiable so in order to tell you more about that and how many Democrats are on board let's go back to the video about this issue is this really important and watch it in its entirety I'm Pro I'm regular video I'm antoinette sedillo lopez i'm alexandria Ocasio cortez it I'm a justice Democrat a number justice Democrat and I'm a justice Democrat running for Congress and I am a justice Democrat running for Congress in New York's 14th congressional district earlier this year Donald Trump signed an executive order to repeal deportation protections for dreamers promising at the time that Congress would pass a replacement dreamers are undocumented in the Brits were brought into the United States as children they were brought here not of the own volition they've grown up in this country worked in this country and know no other home of then America and now because of Trump's actions all 800,000 of them are at risk of being deported unless we get the DREAM Act passed in Congress and for once we have an actual chance to fight back and win this very important battle you see Republicans haven't been able to get enough with their own party together to keep the government funded so on December 8th they want to need Democrats to keep the government operational this is a chance for Democrats to demand something for bailing out the Republicans a rare chance to win a victory we are telling Democrats and Condors demand that the DREAM Act gets passed this should be an absolute no-brainer seventy-three percent of Americans believe the dreamers should have a path to citizenship 25 House Democrats have already pledged to oppose any urine spending legislation without prior passage or inclusion of a clean DREAM Act even one Republican member of Congress has pledged to shut down the government unless the DREAM Act is passed we only need 65 more Democrats to join us so that 800,000 lives can avoid ruin all of us have a chance to get something really good done strong calling and will hurt you do what I would do I had his job I'm calling a really key one I'm calling on House Democrats to do what I do if I had your job so I'm calling on my colleagues pledged publicly to oppose any year in spending legislation without prior passage or inclusion of a clean DREAM Act you have a chance to get something real done and this is our time to do something right don't mess it up all right listen I here's a couple other things that you could do first of all as you saw there 25 House Democrats are already on board but they should all be on board and the just Democrats have done this before we pass with the Medicare we helped with Medicare for all we had a petition that had over a hundred thousand people and it moved about 70 Democratic congressmen actually more than 70 Democratic congressmen to say that they would co-sponsor that they and previously they had not said that let's make that happen in this case we need about sixty five more House Democrats I again I don't know why every Democrat wouldn't be on board for this well what's your excuse what are you just gonna let them pass the budget no of course this is the bare bare minimum that we should ask for so we're also partnering with our dream coalition led by Erica and the ole issue is the press secretary for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 campaign and when you sign the petition it's gonna give you an option to participate in the citizens that are now beginning to happen so if you're if you want to do that you want to take direct action that is
