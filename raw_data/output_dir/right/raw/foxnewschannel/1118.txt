1
00:00:00,853 --> 00:00:03,055
WITH WEAPONS BUT THEY ARE WON BY

2
00:00:03,055 --> 00:00:03,756
MEN.

3
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:06,158
SEE YOU ON AMERICANS NEWSROOM

4
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:09,128
TOMORROW MORNING BRIGHT AND

5
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:09,862
EARLY, 9:00 A.M.

6
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:13,365
HERE'S TUCKER.

7
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,601
>> GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO

8
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,669
TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.

9
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:19,138
IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION

10
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:20,940
TO THE NEWS LATELY, YOU'LL ARE

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,907
PROBABLY CONFUSED ABOUT A BUNCH

12
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:23,108
OF THINGS.

13
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:25,311
BUT YOU KNOW ONE FACT FOR SURE,

14
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:26,545
JAMES COMEY IS A BETTER PERSON

15
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:27,980
THAN YOU ARE.

16
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,750
HE IS A VIRTUOUS MAN, HONEST,

17
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,351
DECENT, CHIVALROUS.

18
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,552
INTEGRITY MIGHT BE HIS MIDDLE

19
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:34,753
NAME ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NEVER

20
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:38,157
ADMIT IT BECAUSE HE'S ALSO

21
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:39,358
INCREDIBLY HUMBLE.

22
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:41,760
HE DOESN'T MAKE THE KIND OF

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,262
GRUBBY MORAL COMPROMISES FOR

24
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:44,597
YOUR SAD MEDIOCRE LIFE.

25
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:46,432
HIS IDEALS ARE HIGH AND HE LIVES

26
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:48,567
THEM.

27
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,603
HE HAS SAID THAT REPEATEDLY AND

28
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:51,237
CABLE NEWS INTERVIEWS SO

29
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:53,639
OBVIOUSLY IT'S TRUE.

30
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:56,008
HOW GOOD OF A PERSON?

31
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:58,577
HE LEFT THE FBI AND HE'S NOT

32
00:00:58,577 --> 00:01:00,779
GIVING LECTURES ON

33
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:02,848
LAW ENFORCEMENT MATTERS, HOW TO

34
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:03,983
UNRAVEL INTERNATIONAL MONITORING

35
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,384
LAUNDERING FRAMES OR STOP DRUG

36
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:07,286
TRAFFICKING, THAT WOULD BE TOO

37
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:09,221
OBVIOUS AND TOO TEMPORAL.

38
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,589
INSTEAD, HE'S TEACHING US ABOUT

39
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:12,191
LEADERSHIP, HOW TO BE BETTER

40
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:13,959
PEOPLE.

41
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:14,927
HIS IS A MORAL MISSION.

42
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,762
>> I COULD BE USEFUL BY OFFERING

43
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:21,033
PEOPLE A VISION OF WHAT ETHICAL

44
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,968
LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE.

45
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:23,602
>> Tucker: IT'S HILARIOUS

46
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:23,969
ACTUALLY.

47
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,738
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SURPRISING.

48
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:27,540
KEEP IN MIND HYPOCRISY IS A

49
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,141
SIGNATURE FACT OF THIS MOMENT.

50
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:30,943
WHATEVER PUBLIC FIGURES ARE

51
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:32,778
SCOLDING YOU FOR DOING, THEY ARE

52
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,913
ALMOST CERTAINLY DOING

53
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:36,015
THEMSELVES, AND AVIDLY, IF IN

54
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:36,348
SECRET.

55
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,217
THE ONES WHO LECTURE YOU ABOUT

56
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:42,021
FEMINISM TURN OUT TO BE

57
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:42,388
PREDATORS.

58
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:46,125
EVERY GUN ACTIVIST SEEMS TO HAVE

59
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:51,564
A FARM TO GUNNING IT ARMED

60
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:51,931
BODYGUARD.

61
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:52,798
THE DOJ LONG AWAITED

62
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:58,437
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ACCUSES

63
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:01,173
COMEY OF PURSUING HIS OWN

64
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:01,540
AGENDA.

65
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,943
THAT'S NOT A SMALL CHARGE IN A

66
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:04,743
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY BUT

67
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:07,112
AGAIN, NOT SURPRISING IN THIS

68
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:09,014
CASE.

69
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:09,782
MR. POLSON, THANK YOU FOR COMING

70
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:10,348
ON.

71
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:17,756
>> THANK YOU, I ENJOYED YOUR

72
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:18,757
MONOLOGUE.

73
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:19,959
>> Tucker: IT WAS HEARTFELT.

74
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,161
I STILL AM A LITTLE SHOCKED BY

75
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:22,728
WHAT WE KNOW.

76
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,364
OR WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW, THERE

77
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,366
ARE LEAKS ABOUT THIS IG REPORT,

78
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,436
AND WE WILL SEE, IT'S COMING

79
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:31,770
OUT, 500 PAGES OR SO, SOON.

80
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,007
BUT WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW, COMEY

81
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:35,774
IS BEING ACCUSED OF

82
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:36,775
INSUBORDINATION WHICH IS NOT A

83
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:39,578
SMALL THING IN THE FBI, IS THAT

84
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:39,912
CORRECT?

85
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:42,581
>> IT'S GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL,

86
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:42,982
ABSOLUTELY.

87
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:45,150
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW ORDERS AND

88
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,418
THEY HAVE TO BE LAWFUL ORDERS.

89
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:47,753
YOU ARE OBLIGED TO FOLLOW AND IF

90
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,990
YOU DON'T, THEY GET RID OF YOU

91
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,857
AND RIGHTLY SO.

92
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:54,226
>> Tucker: SO ASSESS WHAT WE

93
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:56,762
THINK THE IG REPORT SAYS ABOUT

94
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:59,164
HOW HE HANDLED THE

95
00:02:59,164 --> 00:02:59,798
HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL

96
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:02,468
INVESTIGATIONS, IN LIGHT OF YOUR

97
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:03,202
OWN EXPERIENCE WORKING ON YOUR

98
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:04,703
OWN INVESTIGATIONS.

99
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:06,839
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE JOB HE

100
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,139
DID?

101
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,174
>> I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO DO A

102
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:11,143
TERM PAPER ON THAT, TUCKER.

103
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:12,177
YOU COULD DO A MASTER'S THESIS

104
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:13,679
ON ALL THE THINGS THAT WENT

105
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,180
WRONG IN THAT CASE.

106
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,249
FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY HE DID

107
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,385
HIS PRESS CONFERENCE, WHERE HE

108
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,786
EXONERATED HILLARY CLINTON, AND

109
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,955
THEN REOPEN THE CASE ON THE

110
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,356
ANTHONY WEINER MATTER, WE ALL

111
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:26,525
KNEW THAT WAS WRONG.

112
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,160
WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING YOU DON'T

113
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,561
DO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE

114
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,330
IG TELL YOU THAT, IF YOU EVER

115
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,531
COME IN ON A MAJOR INVESTIGATION

116
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,767
IN THE FIELD OF VISION, YOU KNOW

117
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:35,634
THAT YOU DO NOTHING THAT WILL

118
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:40,806
AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF AND

119
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:41,373
ELECTION.

120
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:42,441
AND HE IGNORED THAT.

121
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,642
I WAS FLABBERGASTED WHEN I SAW

122
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:44,376
HIM DO IT.

123
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:46,345
WE COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT HOW

124
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:48,714
HE DIDN'T LET THE FBI TO HIT

125
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:50,449
THEIR JOB, AND HE ACQUIESCED TO

126
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:52,384
NOT HAVING A GRAND JURY.

127
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:55,120
I WAS ONLY THERE 31 YEARS AND I

128
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,257
NEVER SAW THAT, BUT MAYBE I'M

129
00:03:58,257 --> 00:03:58,657
MISSED THAT.

130
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:01,994
THEN HE CALLED IT A MATTER,

131
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:03,829
ACQUIESCED TO THE LORETTA LYNCH

132
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,230
ISSUE.

133
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,999
BEING A LEADER DOESN'T MEAN YOU

134
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,802
LEAD AND CALM WATERS, YOU FIGHT

135
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:11,704
THE HEADWINDS AND HE JUST NEVER

136
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:12,204
DID THAT.

137
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,807
HE NEVER PUT ON HIS FBI HAT,

138
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,442
ALWAYS WEAR HIS DEPARTMENT OF

139
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,211
JUSTICE HAT AND MADE DECISIONS

140
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,012
HE HAD NO BUSINESS MAKING.

141
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,049
I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH HIS

142
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:24,817
REPRESENTATION OF WHAT HAPPENED.

143
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:25,818
>> Tucker: YOU SAID YOU WERE

144
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:28,287
THERE FOR 31 YEARS AND SAW A LOT

145
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,054
OF INVESTIGATIONS TAKE PLACE.

146
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,456
AND YOU NEVER SEEN A SITUATION

147
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:32,024
LIKE THIS WERE A GRAND JURY

148
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,859
WASN'T CALLED.

149
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,127
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

150
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:38,397
>> ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHAT I

151
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:38,697
SAID.

152
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,165
FROM THE MOST IN YOUR

153
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:40,899
INVESTIGATION TO THE MOST MAJOR

154
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:41,800
INVESTIGATION, YOU CANNOT DO

155
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,569
YOUR JOB AS AN AGENT OR

156
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,738
COMMANDER, OR PROSECUTOR,

157
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:47,172
WITHOUT A GRAND JURY.

158
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:49,575
THE FACT THAT THIS IS A MAJOR

159
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:50,743
INVESTIGATION OF NATIONAL

160
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:52,544
IMPORTANCE AND HE ASKED

161
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:53,746
ACQUIESCED TO NOT BEING ALLOWED

162
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,547
TO HAVE A GRAND JURY, HE COULD

163
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:56,348
HAVE GONE TO CONGRESS.

164
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:59,318
HE SHOULD HAVE DONE A LOT OF

165
00:04:59,318 --> 00:04:59,651
THINGS.

166
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:00,819
YOU HAVE TO BUCK THAT HAD WATER

167
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,421
SOMETIMES AND HE DIDN'T DO THAT.

168
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:04,623
AND I THINK IT FRANKLY SHOWED A

169
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:05,124
LACK OF COURAGE.

170
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:08,393
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T

171
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:08,894
WANT A GRAND JURY?

172
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,662
>> THEY DIDN'T WANT TO FIND OUT

173
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:11,597
WHAT HAPPENED.

174
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,398
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

175
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:14,600
IF YOU BRING PEOPLE IN FOR THE

176
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,602
GRAND JURY, YOU CAN GET GRAND

177
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:19,404
JURY SUBPOENAS, YOU CAN COMPEL

178
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,974
TESTIMONY, YOU CAN COMPEL

179
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,041
IMMUNITY, YOU CAN SUBPOENA

180
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,009
DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION.

181
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,245
WITHOUT THAT TOOL YOU ARE JUST

182
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:29,648
BEGGING FOR COOPERATION.

183
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:31,583
THE FBI NEVER LOOKED AT THE

184
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,317
DEMOCRATIC PARTY -- I'M SORRY,

185
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:33,752
THE SERVER THAT THE DEMOCRATS

186
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,554
HAD THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY HACKED.

187
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:38,157
THEY NEVER GOT THAT, THEY SAID

188
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:38,957
NO.

189
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:40,159
