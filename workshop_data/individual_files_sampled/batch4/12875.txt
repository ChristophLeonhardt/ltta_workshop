i attack CNN because i don't love this great clip you got to say do we have time before we go we have maybe a little bit of time before we go you've got to see this clip a pal of mine who has to remain anonymous because his career will get ruined he was watching this live on CNN and they were translating CNN was talking to the relatives of you know illegal aliens who came over and the kids were detained or whatever and they were asking what how are the kids doing what's going on with the kids and here is what CNN played and I don't know how many of you speaks Spanish out there my Spanish isn't great I mostly have Italian a little touch of French but I think what I heard is the woman said dicen que esta muy bien which roughly translates to yeah it says he's doing very well but what did see on it can we play that clip again what did CNN say she said come again it's like in this you know in those movies like with the bad dubbings it'll be a Japanese movie you know and they'll say like you see the mouth moving like maybe I don't know and then they'll dump it over and I'll just say like yes you know you said wait does it sounds like you said more than that did he this is the opposite ear disa kissed Emily bien he says that he's doing terribly and Trump's a criminal and hashtag resist and brick-oven I was a Catholic and so he shouldn't be on the court what all right are you sure about that unbelievable stuff and somehow nobody caught this I think it's cuz nobody watches CNN so yeah it's like one conservative every everyday like one conservative in the country has to sell flagellate and watch CNN to pull all the stupid clips so I guess today that's me now maybe other people play it too it's a really egregious but that is how dishonest these people are I mean that is how that when you turn on CNN which only exists because of airports because they made a deal with the devil and with airports sometime in the 1990s so CNN is played there all the time if they're not reporting news they are a fiction company making a narrative there is somebody who was writing the script to this and there was like the background it's a DC case time we BN it's like okay well what there's no way to translate that cockamamie language how are we how are we ever gonna find that it's like okay well I think it sounds a little bit like Donald Trump is a monster and I hate him and you should and Hillary should have been elected hashtag me too so I just wanted to call that dear attention any time you're tempted to think that we should watch or listen to CNN don't do
