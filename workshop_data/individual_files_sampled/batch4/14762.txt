there's been another jihad attack in New York yesterday morning a bomb went off will a man who went on to the New York bus terminal in Manhattan his name was okay add Ola a classic American name there with your Bangladeshi been in the country seven years Bangladeshi now it's not an Arab it's not Pakistanis time it's a Bangladeshi what's the common thing that links these men every single time and that will be his love for Allah and his following the teachings of the false prophet Muhammad the New York Police Department tweeted today that he has been charged with charge yes because he didn't blow himself up successfully he actually just burned himself burned himself and injured three other people he's been charged with criminal possession of a weapon or a bomb supporting an act of terrorism supporting an actor it blew himself up for God's sake it support an actor is I mean he was the terrorism he wasn't the act making a terroristic threat a threat wasn't threatened threatened to do anything he actually pressed the trigger I'm trying to blow everyone up even when you read those three charges criminal possession of a weapon supporting an act of terrorism making a terroristic threat that doesn't sound like they're charging him with blowing himself up does it we'll have to see how this pans out with the police and the prosecutors but it doesn't read like that when you read those charges maybe American law is different but he's now been treated in hospital because his crap bomb was strapped to his body and it severely burned him he injured three other people but if you think about it the bomb would have gone off properly would have had probably multiple people dead his reason what was the reason he could have done this for cuz we saw the fake news reporting that his reason was because of Jerusalem that's why I started reading are we done it because of Trump he Trump's fall he he would never have done it if it weren't for Trump well that turns out he's absolute nonsense because he come out and he's give the reason to the police why he done it what do you think his massive justification was for blowing their people up that there were Christmas posters on the no joke Christmas posters and this would come into the sense that he was angry because of the Christmas posters on the American bus station and ironically he made his pipe his pipe bomber and nails and Christmas lighting wires what could the solution be to this the liberal ridiculous left would be telling us or in the future this is the line they actually go down it may sound ridiculous but what ban Christmas posters I tell the girls to wear trousers turn nuts come out late at night then they won't get raped by the Muslim men because they won't annoy the Muslim men you've seen this in Germany you've seen headteachers when the children when the parents are saying our daughters are being harassed they say walk the other way don't walk past them don't provoke them with your legs well America provoked this innocent Bangladeshi immigrant who just wanted to go to America and make the country better and they provoked him with Christmas posters how disrespectful of America because obviously he doesn't celebrate Christmas so you should be doing that it's not fair none of this has been fair on acai erred Allah none of this has been fair a worrying thing was this man was not on any watch list in America now we have 23,000 on a watch list in the UK 23,000 who should be gone anyway already we have 20,000 each time there's a terror attack in the UK we find out that the person was known to the authorities usually approached by the authorities usually worked for authorities at some point always on benefits always paid for by us always known you ready for a rant 1% of America is Muslim 1% 5% of my country's Muslim 10% of France is Muslim since September 11th in New York you've seen six successful jihad attacks for a population of 1% it's a numbers game if you don't have the same population percentage as my country you'd have seen 30 successful terror attacks in New York alone 30 if you have the same percentages as France you know the great country and the successful beacon of multiculturalism that is France if you'd have had that you'd have had 60 successful terrorist attacks so when you have someone in the lead in your country who's attempting to address these issues you have to let him you it was elected by the American people on his promise of protecting American citizens finally after hurdle after hurdle after hurdle he's been able to ban the seven most dangerous countries for people coming in he's that enough no it's not his donald trump trying to do more yes he is is he being prevented from doing more yes he is by some members of not on his own republican parties but you're in america you should be looking and learning from our mess okay britain certainly is not a multicultural love list at all far from it we've had four successful terrorist attacks in last nine months i think twelve over the last year have been prevented in stopped do you really want to go down that path do you want to continue adding to that problem as we know it's a numbers game the more muslims the more terrorism that's a reality of where we're at as siddiq said terrorism just a part of everyday life in every major sea there has a muslim population you
