president Trump sat down with North Korean dictator Kim jong-un for a productive meeting that offers some hope for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and the world order but don't tell that to hysterical theoreticians on the left and right who threat and worry that even though everything in reality is fine and actually a little bit good in theory everything is terrible we will analyze the costs and benefits of the Kim summit as well as the MSM spin-doctors who are setting Donald Trump up to fail then former White House press secretary Sean Spicer stops by to shed some light on those media spin doctors as well as the White House's strategy for dealing with them finally on this day in history no coincidence another renegade American president challenges a communist dictator to give peace a chance I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show who knew I'm I think I'm a hippie now I'm a hippie I I want to give peace a chance and all of the Democrats don't they want these to start exploding thing like that that was also true during Reagan's time and we will explain that before we get to that we got to talk about a little money honey we got to make a little money honey and we're gonna do that by talking about honey a wonderful product that will save you money and it's totally free go to join honey calm slash cough FAC o VF e fe honey is this absolutely phenomenal browser extension which I have used for years and years and saved a ton of money using it is totally free you just takes two clicks you add it to your browser it saves you a ton of money it's ingenious when you go shopping online honey will just find you the best deals on everything you're on Amazon it just automatically finds you the cheapest prices for whatever you want to buy on Amazon it applies these discounts you know in the old days you'd have to like go searching and say where's a coupon for whatever or store you know and then you'd cycle through your trial the coupons and they none of them would work and then it would take you an hour and come on your time is worth more than that this is so good it magically adds all sorts of useful info right onto the Amazon page of whatever you're looking at and you just shop like you normally do it automatically searches the two million sellers on Amazon finds you the lowest price it even shows you the items price changes so that you can decide if you want to buy or if you want to wait for it to come down a little bit when honey's got your back you will never overpay for anything on Amazon ever again I actually can't tell you the last time I used honey to buy something because I couldn't tell you the last time I didn't use honey to buy something online I have used this consistently for years every basically every purchase I make on the Internet is with honey it's so so good you'd be foolish not to add it to your browser no reason not to do it it is free takes two clicks to install will make sure you always get the lowest price on Amazon add honey for free at join honey calm slash cough fa CoV f EF e join honey dot-com slash cough FAC o v f EF e okay lot to talk about I don't know that I have ever seen a diplomatic event receive stupider press coverage and analysis in my entire lifetime other than maybe do you remember the koi pond incident Donald Trump was in Japan with Shinzo Abe a and he fed a fish and then the media tried to make this into some huge gaffe even though Shinzo Abe a did the same thing and so maybe other than that but this is receiving really stupid coverage on the left and the right and I don't know for reaction to pundits coverage before I give my analysis in in reaction to this historic Trump Kim summit we turn now to North Korean dictator Kim jong-un and mr. Ahn you have been watching CNN all morning what is your take on the analysis that's a great question that's actually my exact reaction is well the big takeaway here the the 30,000 foot view of this Kim summit at Trump Kim summit in Singapore is stop trying to make the first inning into the ninth inning stop it stop trying to make this into the final thing like overnight we're gonna radically change the world we're in the first inning of this whole thing Secretary of State Pompeyo is hashing things out we've been negotiating with North Korea for a very long time now really for decades but under this administration for months and months and months what you take away from this summit is broadly we are on track for a deal that's a good thing that's the broad scope a lot of things could have gone wrong here imagine all of the things that could have gone wrong that the media would have harped on and said this is the end of the world this is humiliating for America and because none of those things went wrong now they just have to make stuff up here is what could have gone wrong a Kim could have not shown up that easily could have happened right that would have been absolutely humiliating right he could have he could have stormed out he could have shown up and then he could have stormed out like when Trump called him fat which actually happened we'll get to the clip of it later it is hilarious Trump called him fat in public he could have stormed out right there that would have been awful or Kim could have gotten there and said we're not gonna do nuclear eyes I got two words for you Donald Trump and then happy birthday and that would have been truly humiliating for the United States the American president flies to this summit and then Kim could have said we're not going to denuclearize and Kim would have had a lot of leverage their right because he would have been playing on this sort of Obama paradigm of Obama was so desperate to get any deal with America's adversaries that he was willing to give them everything in exchange and to be humiliated Iran captures our sailors Iran demands we free up money in European banks Iran demands a hundred billion dollars of money flown over in an airplane he had a lot of leverage here but it went very well now what could have gone better here because it didn't go per I'm not saying this is some huge win this is a world-changing win no this is a minor win this is a step in the right direction this is basically good but it's not worth screaming and pulling your hair right over and it's also not worth jumping around in the streets to be thrilled about it's just a good sign that's okay we can smile that's nice what could have gone better well a guess we could have worked out a treaty overnight for the immediate denuclearization and an end to a 70 year conflict overnight with no concessions from the United States I guess that would have been better what what are the odds that that would have happened zero that does not exist in reality no negotiation would have let that happen the the purpose of this meeting and you wouldn't know this if you watch the mainstream media but the purpose of this meeting was to get some goodwill for continued do negotiations to have the two heads of state here meet one another have Donald Trump feel the guy out Mike Pompeo spelt this guy out and and that's what we got we got this it all worked out basically pretty well now don't pop the champagne we haven't we don't have a deal yet we've just got a good step in the right direction anybody that was expecting more than that anybody who was expecting you know some overnight a magical thing that would have gotten rid of all of North Korea's nuke that they've relied on for decades they were trying to set up a narrative that Donald Trump would fail that's what they were trying to do right because that obviously wasn't going to happen and so when that didn't pan out they could have said haha see we were right there is there is so much bad analysis out there about this meeting we'll try to get to all of the objections and show why they're so ridiculous but let's begin with the main objection so the main objection here is that Western democratic statesman would never meet with totalitarian dictators how awful how terrible that would be that's never happened before this is totally unprecedented awful no president has ever done this well except for a ton of other world leaders from Western democracies like Churchill and Stalin Churchill met with Stalin okay well okay but other than that M Nixon and Mao Nixon went over and piled around with Chairman Mao and other much more murderous dictator than Kim jong-un and they paled around and like played ping-pong and swam around but other and I'm sorry also Kennedy and Khrushchev so Kennedy met with Khrushchev a maniacal dictator of the Soviet Union who almost blew up the entire world during the Cuban Missile Crisis but other well and okay also Donald Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein then a special envoy to the Middle East for Ronald Reagan Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein another murderous dictator who used WMD on his own people but other than no really except for Reagan and Gorbachev Reagan meeting with Gorbachev before the liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika Reagan meeting with the Soviet dictator a guy who you know enslaved a gazillion people behind the Iron Curtain and piled around and smiled and shook his hand and slapped him on the back okay so it actually happens all the time okay so I I'm sorry because I thought because I watched CNN I thought this had never happened this was totally unprecedented this destroyed American credibility on the world stage actually it happens all the time so this is actually much more of a no-brainer than any of those right does anybody really believe that Kim jong-un is on the same level of wickedness as Stalin or Hitler or mal of course not of course no that's not to say Kim jong-un is a good guy he's a miserable awful vicious evil thug but as a matter of scale even as a matter of ideology there is not a chance that Kim is on the same scale as Hitler right so what is it the heart of hitlerism or of Stalinism or you know that its expansion right so a Hitler's plan was to conquer all of these countries conquer all of this territory expand expand expand the same thing with the Soviet Union expand expand expand take over the whole world we're gonna have this giant Empire the Soviet empire what does Kim jong-un's plan is to maintain his own little neighborhood over there and in her third Korea to keep his own little tin pot dictatorship Kim is a gangster he's much more like Castro than he is like Hitler he's like Castro is a little dictator of a Banana Republic and by the way Barack Obama dealt with Castro remember Barack Obama deals with Raul Castro everybody says this is wonderful and in that negotiation Obama gave Castro everything in exchange for nothing gave him everything said American tourists can come here even though I can't get the sanctions repealed from Congress I'm gonna make it much much easier for Americans to spend money there I'm going to practically stop enforcing sanctions against Cuba the Cuban embargo act that when Donald Trump deals with Kim jong-un he gives him basically nothing nothing yet Donald Trump gives Kim basically nothing yet and that yet is where the negotiations come in so lefties and Trump critics on the right are spinning this summit as this huge loss for America this huge win for North Korea this we shouldn't pay that really much attention because we knew they would do this right the Sean Spicer was talking about this yesterday and we'll have him on later we're going to talk with Sean Spicer he's coming up but he was talking about this yesterday said there's no bar that Donald Trump could reach that would get mainstream media approval for this summit they'll find something wrong in the handshake or what he says or a joke that he made or right and that's exactly what is playing out but it gets so much crazier than this you've got to hear some of the hysteria that is coming out of the mainstream media and we will explain why it gets to the central premise of the left and why basically everybody is reacting stupidly to the summit before we do that we got to talk about man crates baby we got a Father's Day is coming up and you know this this is the problem with Father's Day every year is your dad won't tell you what he wants right so you're gonna say hey dad what do you what do you want for Father's Day he'll say don't get don't get me anything right that's always like don't get me anything cuz then especially if it's a you know if you're a younger child because he's the father's thinking like let's just my money right you know here's a don't but if you're when you're an adult even they'll say now don't get me anything and then you don't get him anything and then he's angry and sad right because he's your father don't worry about that anymore he doesn't want to tie he doesn't want right what he wants is a very cool gift experience called man crates so give him a gift he's guaranteed to loved it's handpicked and packaged gifts for every type of debt there's the knife making kit for the hands-on dad or the whiskey appreciation crate for fathers who like the finer things and by the way if someday my children are looking back on this and you know they're watching a rerun of of my show I want the whiskey appreciation crate that's the one I want that's the good I actually got one it's so good I used the the decanter all the time it's got a really cool whiskey glasses great ice cubes spherical ice cube makers really really good most gives ship in a wooden sealed crate with a crowbar so he can pry open his man crate in front of everyone when was the last time you gave your dad a gift that he needed a crowbar to open with man crates you're giving dad more than a gift you're giving him experience like any other I really think this about gifts most people have stuff we have a ton of stuff in America and 2018 you don't really need any stuff but a gift is about the giving and the experience of giving in the relationship and what that represents and man crates is a wonderful experience get your a special Father's Day discount today with a hundred percent satisfaction guarantee at man crates calm / knowles K&O wles this is a limited time offer only for Father's Day which is coming up folks so go today man crates calm / Knowles Keo wles man crates calm / Knowles alright so back to the media hysteria over this summit so Brent you douse key writing in the hill he says this is the headline Trump let Kim get away with murder all right how's it gonna go on from there this really writes quote Trump is now a danger to the democratic alliance by the way I thought he was a danger after net neutrality and tax reform no way isn't that the big day that was gonna kill us all okay but now I guess now it's super serious now he's a danger to the democrat alliance Bude ascii goes on quote he is the only president in American history who treats America's friends like enemies and its enemies like friends until except the last President Obama who treated our allies in Israel like enemies and our enemies in Iran like friends exactly and and oh and a lot of statesmen deal with adversaries with both diplomacy and with strong-arm tactics this you know it basically every claim he makes is not true statesman regularly meet with dictators this guy is upset that Donald Trump was mean to Justin Trudeau of Canada and it's funny we talked about Trudeau yesterday and how he's like a little whiny little boy people forget that Ronald Reagan was also mean to the last Trudeau of Canada because obviously little boy Justin Trudeau is he got his position through nepotism his father Pierre Trudeau was a former leader of Canada and Reagan didn't like him either because I don't like these whiny left you know they're just not enjoyable people to deal with so okay I guess they forgot about that here is some mainstream media analysis and build-up to show you exactly what I mean the optics are very significant and as you know a lot of analysts have suggested this is already a public relations win for North Korea because the North Korean leader is being well-received on the international stage right now is it already a win for kim jungeun and that that's a big win for him regardless of what comes out of this summit him on the world stage in a way that no leader from North Korea has ever been I think this is a huge win in terms of respect legitimacy so this is really funny isn't it this is they say hey regardless of what happens this is going to be a loss for Donald Trump well how do you know that you know there's a transparent in trying to set up Trump to fail they say no matter what happens he's gonna lose right okay okay can we all agree on that like I know he could lose if you know Kim storms out or insults the United States on the world stage but he could win right it could be a sort of win and this is also funny because you'll remember the Olympics which it happened five minutes ago do you remember during those Olympics in Korea how the left loved putting the Kim family on the world stage because their argument now is if you put Kim in the spotlight and you put him next to American leaders then that's gonna be bad that's gonna be really bad except for five minutes ago when it was great when that dragon lady became the breakout star of the Winter Olympics around he said oh she stole the show she's the breakout store Oh but that was when it was the Olympics that was one it was a left-wing thing doing it now that Donald Trump's doing it it's bad do you follow that logic and by the way what's gonna happen now is the left is gonna say well sure okay that was hypocritical but now conservatives are hypocritical to enjoy this summit not true not true at all the Olympics was the left cheering on brutal dictators despite Donald Trump this summit is conservatives dealing in diplomatic flattery in the hopes of peace after all of the other strategies that we have tried for several decades have failed that's what this is a that is a huge difference all of the other strategies have failed and this one offers at least sort of hope for a victory so you remember also about six seven months ago when Donald Trump was threatening war the mainstream media said it was horrible remember he was saying my button is bigger than your button I've got fire and fury and nuclear weapons that I could write and they said that's awful that's gonna lead to World War 3 now Donald Trump is doing the opposite he's pursuing diplomacy the media you know what they're saying you're gonna be shocked to hear this they're saying it's horrible you're saying it's awful it's kind of it's weird it's like he's kind of damned if he doesn't damn it if he doesn't the real answer of course is that we have to do both we need to have credibility and the credible threat of violence and we have to pursue diplomacy the media are reporting that this is a big win for Kim this is the huge win what did he win ask yourself that because they're all gonna report that that's gonna be the headline this was a huge win for Kim okay what did he win did the United States lift the economic sanctions no we have some of the stiffest sanctions in place that we've ever had against North Korea that's the main leverage that's actually what's at issue this negotiation is between nuclear weapons and economic sanctions that's what it is you get to you can either have a gigantic nuclear arsenal or you can participate in global trade that that's it and right and that's basically we're trying to get the North Koreans to give up the weapons in exchange for participating in the international community we we still have all the sanctions in place all of that leverage is in place that's why it's not like the Iran deal now what what else did he win he got publicity on the world stage Kim gets plenty of publicity on the world stage all by his himself that's totally fine he already got a legitimacy by the way on the world stage from April's Panmunjeom declaration in South Korea that was when they went a couple months ago to South Korea and declared they're gonna pursue denuclearization and an end to the Korean War so he's already got that legitimacy on the world stage that's that's been building for a long time so what else did he get he got a handshake and some flattering words from Donald Trump by the way I don't know if you've watched a clips of Donald Trump over the past four decades but he can be a little hot or cold you know if you're nice to him and he's getting what he wants he can be effusive he can be over-the-top flattering and then the minute you turn on him he's just knifes you in the back and he kind of goes back and forth because that's what he does because he's a New Yorker and he's a real-estate guy you know that's how he talks I don't think people put a whole lot of stock and some flattering words from Donald Trump yeah and also American leaders have always shaken hands with murderous dictators in fact this goes all the way back to the founding of the country Thomas Jefferson and John Adams made nice with the Barbary pirates who were enslaving our sailors basically at the foundation of our country they made nice they said nice words to them they made concessions to them right this has been going on since the very beginning so what did Donald Trump say Donald Trump said Kim is talented this is obviously true it's sort of damning with faint praise because Kim's talent is it enslaving his own people and murdering his all of his opponents but it's obviously true you know the guy took power at age 26 and managed to keep hold over this bizarro world communist dictatorship long after communism was relegated to the ash heap of history but also what else did Donald Trump say about Kim seven months ago he called him short and fat he sent out that tweet he said oh I would never call Kim jong-un and fat actually by the way Donald Trump called Kim jong-un fat in the room at this summit listen to this and then watch the look on Kim Jong Un's face of you who weren't watching you got a look at Kim jong-un's face in this because he says you know yeah we're gonna we got to look really thin really nice you know the camera pans over and and Kim jong-un looks there like Larry David you just kind of sees it we're gonna look really thin and it goes over your like bum that is really a perfect perfect way to start to because it's not just an offhanded thing that's a little dig that's a very Trumpy very New York little dig to say who's boss here right oh we're gonna look hey we got a you've got to work pretty hard to make us look thin okay huh hey you you get it don't you Kimmy you get it little one I don't know what is it one ear so whatever Kim Jong Un's nickname is maybe probably doesn't have a nickname now okay the big concession that is being reported here is that Donald Trump said that he would cancel a joint military exercise with South Korea as a concession toward denuclearization and everyone's freaking out they say Oh South Korea didn't know about this by the way South Korea issued the president of South Korea issued a statement talking about how wonderful this summit was how great Donald Trump did so you know those headlines take them with less than a grain of salt but also the point that everybody is missing here is that the war game that's being talked about isn't scheduled to happen for a full year the the joint military exercise that's been canceled isn't scheduled to happen for a year by the way you'll you'll recall another big event in Korea was recently cancelled and then it wasn't cancelled the summit that he said that at right this isn't dumb Trump said the summits canceled too bad it's over and then a couple days later Kim comes back to the table he says okay it's back on this is obviously just a negotiating tactic he's obviously saying look we're gonna we're gonna try to not have to have this military exercise but then he later said in that same discussion right he says look in six months we'll see if Kim does what he says he's gonna do if not I'm gonna have to say something else I'm gonna have to change my mind he told a joke he's like he says I'm gonna I'm gonna come up with an excuse to explain it or something but what he's signaling there is okay in a year I sure would like it if we don't need that joint military exercise because by the way we only need these provocative exercises if North Korea is provoking us and saying they're gonna blow up the world of nuclear weapons that's why we have to show them that we've still got giant planes that can blow them to smithereens also by the way this handshake did not come cost-free to North Korea they're saying oh well it put him on the world stage with the president and that you know that's a big propaganda win I don't know maybe I mean he's already been elevated to these levels of running a country he does run his own country right but this handshake does it come cost-free information is very tightly controlled into and out of North Korea now we have images of Kim jong-un palying around with Donald Trump talking about friendship between him and Donald Trump a new era we're gonna let the past be the past that undoes a lot of North Korean propaganda there's been propaganda throughout North Korea for the past 70 years about how America's the evil this evil country and we're gonna come we're still at war they're the enemy they're unhuman human and now you see this picture and they're piling around right and Donald Trump is the big guy in the room just physically is this a giant guy compared to short fat little rocket man he's smiling he's calling Kim fat in the room it's hard to undo those images too it's hard to undo those images and those cut against a lot of North Korean propaganda so even that which is the only possible win that the North Korea could say they got here even that is a double-edged sword and but this is the big lefty argument right the big lefty argument is optics they say oh the optics just didn't look good I don't know why they didn't look good only the optics of Donald Trump standing there with it didn't look good and this is my central argument about the left they the left cares about the appearance of the thing rather than the thing itself so you know they say who cares if it works in practice does it work in theory right that's that's their argument bad optics bad optics for whom who was as bad optics for this is another central premise of bad optics right it's this prejudice of the left the left thinks oh we would never be duped because we're smart people but those rube idiot masses they can be duped by optics that's the that's the premise and that's the prejudice this oh it's bad optics what do you mean what are you saying bad optics what you're saying is it's not actually bad but it looks bad to stupid people right everybody else is so much stupider than we we blessed few in the media you know and that's why the bad optics matter that's totally wrong in in real life the actual people who get fooled by optics are precisely the people who worry about those optics so much of the time in the mainstream media this is why Donald Trump communicates so well right people understand what Donald Trump means in the mainstream media worried about the optics all the theoreticians they worry about the optics you know Donald Trump announced his presidency or his presidential campaign he said Mexico sending criminals over the border now the mainstream media the never Trump movement they all worried they said all the optics people said what was wrong with what Trump said he said well it's not that it was wrong exactly it's that the optics were bad when people knew what he meant Americans knew what he meant they are sending criminals across the border not everybody's a criminal no but they are they're a lot of grip crime comes across the border from Mexico first of all by definition illegal immigration is a crime also a ton of drugs also a ton of gang members also ms-13 speaking of ms-13 that animals remark he said ms-13 they're animals and they said oh the optics oh the OP it sounds like he's calling immigrants animals no it does him he didn't say that but it's maybe idiots would think that right with your but you mainstream media you were the idiots you were the people are not the idiots you are the idiots and finally the the final before because we'll have to move on we gotta get you on Spicer on the final stupid media narrative here is that this was reckless impulsive it was driven by ego and narcissus some is reckless what was he doing Donald Trump has been explaining this for decades he's been talking about doing this for decades here's Donald Trump explaining precisely what happened in 1999 North Korea is totally out of control and would you rather have a very very serious chat with them now and if necessary you might have to do something fairly drastic or would you rather have to go after them in five years when they have more nuclear warheads and missiles than we do you go and you start negotiating and if you don't stop them from that you will have to take rather drastic actions because if you don't take them now you're gonna be an awfully big trouble in five years from now when they have more missiles than we do we're a bunch of SAP's what if they're North Koreans don't play ball develop a nuclear capability go forward with their missile development does the United States act unilateral excuse me if if spoken to correctly correctly they will play ball look on another front what happened recently where Clinton has asked our trade our so-called trade partners to come so we can renegotiate some fairness into trade right they don't show up they say we're not coming why would Germany show up why would France show up why would Japan show up they've been ripping this off for years so why would they come here it's ridiculous it's it's interesting that these old clips do shed a lot of light on Donald Trump's thinking because he's thinking about this essentially he pivots at the end he's just talking about trade right it goes from talking about Karina talking about trade because he views these things as trade negotiations as business negotiations and this is Donald Trump's strengths first of all what else are we gonna do right these other strategies haven't worked so why not give this a shot what's the loss the loss is nothing that Kim doesn't basically already have and nothing that can't be revoked but this is Donald Trump's strength Donald Trump negotiates with the worst people on earth right the idea to not meet with Kim is was one of fear oh I fear what if this mate lead to this optic and that doesn't just do it just do it just do it now and then if that doesn't work we'll do something else okay just don't be afraid stop being so fearful and just try something but this is Trump's strength he negotiates with the worst people on earth these real estate guys in new or mobsters literally mobsters if you want to do New York real estate you have to talk to the mob and certainly did in the 70s and 80s before Rudy Giuliani Donald Trump's lawyer cracked the mob in New York a reality television I mean TV those people are trust me I see them all the time in Hollywood they're like the worst people on earth and politics right so he deals with these people and he's negotiating in a way that you would talk to thugs in the way that you would talk to gangsters and that's what literal gangsters are in New York real estate and it's what Kim jong-un is he's a gangster and Trump is talking to him like a gangster and we'll see what comes from it it's it's a it's a certainly a step in the right direction to call it an amazing win is obviously premature and to say that this is possibly the end of the world is also clearly wrong this was a step in the right direction if it goes in the wrong direction we'll pull it back nothing lost those sanctions are still in place we still have the position of strength we got a break Sean Spicer on to talk about all this ridiculous media spin I spoke with Sean last night we're going to have him after the break but I'm sorry if you're on Facebook and YouTube sorry guys I don't know what to tell you you got to go to daily wire calm right now

yesterday Sean Spicer really cool guy former spokesman for the president White House press secretary he's got a new book coming out called the briefing and I usually read the book before the interview the book it really is not out yet I don't have an advanced copy of it it's coming out next month but talking to sure I've talked to Sean about what's in the book it sounds really interesting I can't wait to read it by the way that Father's Day special is gonna be at 4 p.m. Pacific today and 7 p.m. eastern be sure to tune in for that and here we here's our talk with Sean Spicer Sean thank you for being here thanks for having me so you had the hardest job on planet Earth a White House press secretary spokesman for the president United States how would you rate your tenure at the White House you can be a letter grade numerical siskel and ebert thumbs up how do you think that you did looking back on it now I you know I I think that considering the nature of Trump's presidency that he was a disrupter that this is a guy he didn't come at this with a group of political loyalists that a lot of people have had in the past I think we did really well when you look at what we accomplished in the first six months and the groundwork that that laid to things like tax reform you know I think it really was a disruptive time but it also was a productive time absolutely I certainly agree with that can you take us behind the scenes a little bit I've always wondered about that job more than the chief of staff more than even the president what it is like in that pressure cooker for the press secretary what does a typical day look like it's a great question because I think there's a question of what does the job normally look like and what does it look like under a trump administration because one of the things that I did is really speak to a lot of my predecessors and try to understand the battle rhythm of the day what happens the the process that they all enjoyed that was vastly different under Trump because you know for the most part throughout my career and throughout the career of most press people you're advising the principal as far as what to say when to say it and you know even what platform to use with Trump he's pretty much the lead on a lot of those things that's a very different dynamic and when it came to the briefing obviously the intensity in scrutiny during the Trump administration was vastly different than it has been under any previous administration and so the job in itself is very very different than then than it was in the past and part of the you know you mentioned the book earlier I I walked through a day-in-the-life what I used to be like to get ready every day and the only way to really you know the short end of it it was like getting ready for a final exam every day well you know I I really look forward to reading it I you always try to read the book before the interview but I don't have a copy yet so I'm eagerly looking forward because it sounds really good and I agree obviously the Trump administration is just a different beast than these previous administrations I thought you handled yourself wonderfully I was a big cheerleader of Sean Spicer and Sean Spicer universe one I knew there was one out there yes funny yeah can I tell you a funny story that you you just brought that up I'm on I've been at an event for my son in the last hour so and I walked in and one of the other parents said gosh that tweet you put out about Trudeau was hysterical and I said are you being serious because you know that's not me right and they were like what do you mean that's like you're following a parody account that is a lot of people will see those tweets all the time and I think the reason the parody works so well is it because the account of Sean's spicier or the you know the the spicier version it actually does channel a lot of that spirit you brought to it I mean you I actually always I always felt you were I feel you were far kinder to those blood sucking leeches in the media then they deserved it all I thought you know you handled him very well do you have any regrets about them I found they would always try to gin up these fake gaffes about you like you know you were lost in the bushes or something or you made a completely accurate statement about the number of people who viewed the inauguration and they would pretend like you were saying these crazy things do you have regrets about that you wish you a I don't know been harder on them or something well there's a lot of interactions that that I've had you know whether it's personal or professional when I look back and say you know could I have been better at that and I think just because there you know it's it's a lot of the advice that I look back on with stuff that you know most of our moms teach us right two wrongs don't make a right just because they said it doesn't mean you do - and and and so there were times when I think I probably let them get a let them get the better of me once in a while or I we escalated too quickly but you're right I mean there were times when I looked at and I thought to myself wait a second the job of the press secretary is to speak on behalf of the president of the administration the American people and it was too often that I had to talk about myself and that's that's not a good place to be as a press person right and well this gets to a real question because there seems to be this media crack-up in the last few years in the old days the network's dominated Republicans had to play with these guys even though they were quite hostile now we have all these other outlets we have Twitter we have live streaming you've been in Republican communications for a long time but you know people know you primarily as the press secretary you were communications director for the RNC House Budget Committee chief strategist of the RNC you've known them for a long time this question has two parts should Republicans still talk to outlets that are hostile to them the New York Times or should we tell these lefty mouthpieces to go pound sand and second are there any good journalists that you would still recommend these guys are doing hard work they're not just partisan hacks - great questions on the first one yes we should talk to them because you don't seed ground you don't grow the audience you don't allow people to hear conservative ideas if you ignore them I believe just like you know that if you look at what what the church does in terms of missionaries the idea is to go out there and to spread the good news and I think if you are a social and fiscal conservative then part of what you want to do is go out there and explain to people because what happens more than anything is a lot of these Main Street outlets either you know cover conservatives in a very nasty way or don't cover issues of importance and so by being out there it allows people who might be what so hey I never thought of that issue in that way or I never knew that I shared the views of you know a particular person might be espousing them on a policy or what-have-you and so I think it's a great way to grow the movement and secondly yeah there are a lot of great reporters in that briefing room and you know the interesting thing is and I actually have a part in the book where I talk about this where there are some really good reporters at a lot of reputable outlets it's not it's not always just the broad brush the Washington Post New York Times or whatever there are good reporters at a lot of these institutions and what I want to do is make sure that we call balls and strikes better that we call out the bad reporters and then we praise the good ones because when we just say fake news or the New York Times is horrible then we we sort of dismiss the ones that are actually doing a decent job and I think what what has really killed things is two things one is social media where reporters almost acted as if people don't have Twitter accounts themselves because they express these opinions and things that really expose their liberal bias and second is the need for a lot of these reporters to get on television will make them say and do outrageous things to sort of get themselves booked that makes perfect sense that that you know that the sensationalism of it obviously not every reporter is just Jim Acosta who I believe is played by Will Ferrell these days on television that you know there are there are people at these outlets who aren't just the editors they're all are doing work and I agree I think it might be something about our Catholicism that we just are perfectly willing to talk to anybody go into the belly of the beast but I have taken too much of your time you got to run you are you're with your family right now that's another thank you you know the funny thing is after reading your book I really felt inspired you know people ask me all the time why do I want to write a book and I just felt your book really laid out a lot of the policies but I think we're so key to the Democrats current state of being that I just needed to kind of put my thoughts to paper but I I think it was it was a lot more writing than and you probably did well perhaps although I did a lot of research and I will say Shawn I always knew you were I always knew were a gentleman but now I know that you're a scholar as well so I look forward to reading yours there were a couple at some point we have more time I want to debate a couple of the issues that you raised in there right around the 200 page mark I thought you got into some pretty meaty stuff it does it's an esoteric reading too so what will really have to go into the different layers that we have there but I suppose that'll be for a future episode John thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it and they'll talk to you next time you bet thank you god I love that guy so the book by the way is the briefing I look forward to reading it I've got a pre-order and it's gonna be great I'm sure because Sean Spicer was there at the moment you know at this moment of this colossal new administration coming in and he dealt with the press really really well my you know it's funny because a lot of people criticize him for being too harsh on the press I think he was far too nice to them I thought he did a really good job look forward to reading the book before I let you go we only have a couple minutes here at the end I do want to point out something on this day in history related to this kin summit because people aren't drawing the connection and it's because as with so many things that come around with Donald Trump they're looking just at the surface level and they're not seeing all the little jokes and all of the little coincidences that happen underneath it so let's get to this day in history on this day in history in 1987 Ronald Reagan went to Berlin and gave a very famous speech to a Soviet dictator Mickey Gorbachev to tear down this wall the Kim summit took place on the same day now it seems like it was yesterday because you know it was in Singapore and we're here in the United States but if this was June 12th so the Kim summit took place on June 12th tear down this wall took place on June 12th this could be a coincidence but it's a pretty big coincidence and you've got to remember the people around Donald Trump the people setting up this summit with a North Korean dictator Kim jong-un these are pretty sophisticated people who have been around politics for a very long time now I think Donald Trump is pretty smart as well but a lot of people they say oh he's a dummy he's a dummy they don't they fail to realize by the way that all the really successful presidents have played dummies Ronald Reagan did it Bill Clinton actually did it George Bush did it they forget that part but even if you think that Donald Trump is a dummy all the people around him are pretty sophisticated Mike Pompeo john bolton these are guys who were around during the reagan years and i it's really hard for me to believe that that is a coincidence and it's by the way both of those speeches but the summit and the tear down this wall speech were about the exact same thing it was an appeal to renew arms reduction talks here is ronald reagan at the berlin wall there is one sign that the soviets can make that would be unmistakable that would advance Drennen become dramatically the cause of freedom and peace general secretary Gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr. Gorbachev open this gate mr. Gorbachev mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall what a speech and a line written by the way I think by Peter Robinson who also has the great show uncommon knowledge a tear down this wall Ronald Reagan applies two techniques here he's harsh they're right tear down this wall tear down this wall he's also nice even if you seek peace and he was nice to Gorbachev he would flatter him he would shake his hand he would Pat his back here's just a little clip I pulled up on the Internet of Ronald Reagan flattering dear old Gorby and the significance of that today we are commemorating an event that is highly symbolic Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev shook hands on the step you see behind you it had all started right here with a handshake that changed history they shook hands this is you know when we look back at history we sometimes remember it in a very distorted way we just remember Reagan bearing down tear down this Walter but there was also the the friendliness to mickey gorbachev we just remember him saying we're gonna build up Star Wars SDI we're gonna run you out of the arms race right we forget that Ronald Reagan was begging for the abolition of nuclear weapons with the leader of the Soviet Union stormed out of a meeting because they couldn't abolish nuclear weapons there are two sides of this and there have to be two sides to these negotiations the harsh the credible threat of violence the tough-guy and the the diplomatic niceties and the diplomatic flattery and the handshaking in the back patting so far that's what we're getting out of this that's a good day that's a win might all go wrong tomorrow and then in six months Trump is gonna come up and say it was all wrong it's gonna be all over again but for today this is a this is a good move in the right direction and we should be happy about it not thrilled not poppin champagne just happy it's a good step in the right direction take yes for an answer people come on okay we've got some really crazy shows coming up this week I don't want to ruin it for you but we decided my first week after the honeymoon is just gonna be this insane week it's gonna be pretty wild so be sure to tune in tomorrow and through the rest of the week in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show get your mailbag questions and for Thursday I'll see you tomorrow the Michael Nolt show is produced by seniya Villarreal executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer Mathis Glover and our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Jim nickel audio is mixed by mic core Amina hair and makeup is by Jeshua alvera the Michael Knowles show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing 2018 you
