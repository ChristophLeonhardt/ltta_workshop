NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
THE BILL COSBY VERDICT.
NOW REPORTING, DAVID MUIR.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, I'M DAVID 
MUIR COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
THERE IS BREAKING NEWS IN BILL 
COSBY'S SEXUAL ASSAULT RETRIAL.
THERE HAS BEEN A VERDICT.
HE HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON ALL 
COUNTS.
EVERS ACCUSED OF DRUGGING AND 
ASSAULTING A WOMAN AT HIS 
PHILADELPHIA HOME, AGAIN, 
GUILTY, ALL COUNTS, MOMENTS AGO 
THAT PAM OF SEVEN MEN AND FIVE 
WOMEN AFTER DELIBERATING FOR 14 
HOURS CAME BACK WITH THE 
VERDICT.
THEY COME BACK WITH THREE 
QUESTIONS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS 
BUT NO QUESTIONS TODAY.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR LEGAL 
ANALYST SUNNY HOSTIN WATCHING 
WITH ME.
GUILTY ON ALL THREE COUNTS.
A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT.
HE FACES PRISON TIME.
SIGNIFICANT PRISON TIME. 
>> HE DOES.
I THINK THE ISSUE HERE WAS 
ALWAYS ONE OF CONSENT.
WHETHER OR NOT ANDREA CONSTAND 
CONSENTED TO SEXUAL 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BILL COSBY 
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT 
IS -- WHAT WAS THE GAME CHANGER 
HERE WAS THE OTHER WOMEN ALLOWED
TO TESTIFY AND SO THE 
PROSECUTION HERE THEN WAS ABLE 
TO PROVE THIS WAS A PATTERN FOR 
BILL COSBY.
HE DRUGGED WOMEN.
HE THEN ASSAULTED WOMEN WITHOUT 
THEIR CONSENT BECAUSE CLEARLY 
YOU CAN'T CONSENT IF YOU ARE 
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR 
ALCOHOL.
AND SO THAT I THINK WAS THE 
DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE AS 
OPPOSED TO THE FORMER TRIAL 
WHERE WE KNOW THAT THE JURY 
DEADLOCKED ON WHETHER OR NOT TO 
CONVICT BILL COSBY. 
>> FOR THOSE OF OUR VIEWERS 
JOINING US NOW, BILL COSBY'S 
RETRIAL.
HE'S JUST BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON 
ALL COUNTS.
WE DO KNOW THIS CONVICTION COULD
PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR UP TO TEN 
YEARS ON EACH COUNT, OUR TEAM 
INSIDE THE COURTROOM REPORTING 
THAT THERE WAS NO REACTION FROM 
BILL COSBY.
HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD AS THIS
VERDICT WAS DELIVERED.
THOUGH THERE WERE AUDIBLE GASPS 
IN THE COURTROOM AND ANDREA 
CONSTAND NODDING HER HEAD WHEN 
SHE HEARD THE VERDICT.
AS WE KNOW THIS IS THE SECOND 
TIME SHE HAS FACED BILL COSBY IN
COURT AND, SUNNY, AS YOU POINTED
OUT THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE THEY 
WERE ABLE TO HEAR FROM OTHER 
WOMEN THAT MIGHT HAVE BOLSTERED 
THIS CASE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY, AND I
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BILL
COSBY'S ATTORNEYS CERTAINLY 
FOUGHT AGAINST.
HIS PRIOR ATTORNEYS, MORE 
SUCCESSFUL.
AND I WILL SAY WHEN YOU'RE A 
PROSECUTOR AS I WAS AND YOU WANT
TO PROVE THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS
THE BEHAVIOR OF SOMEONE, IT 
CERTAINLY IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL 
IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE VOICE.
WE'RE IN THE TIME OF THE ME TOO 
MOVEMENT AND I'M SURE CERTAINLY 
THERE IS A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE 
QUESTION OF CONSENT SO IF YOU'RE
A PROSECUTOR YOU NOT ONLY HAVE 
ANDREA'S VOICE, YNOW YOU HAVE 
ONE, TWO -- I BELIEVE THERE WERE
FIVE WOMEN THAT TESTIFIED THIS 
WAS HIS PATTERN AND PRACTICE.
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IN MY VIEW 
FOR A JURY TO LOOK AWAY UNDER 
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
THAT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING 
EVIDENCE OF A PATTERN OF 
PRACTICE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
>> YOU BRING UP THE MOMENT THE 
COUNTRY IS IN, THE ME TOO 
MOVEMENT BRINGING MUCH NEEDED 
ATTENTION TO WOMEN IN THE 
WORKPLACE AND WOMEN WHO HAVE 
ACCUSED PEOPLE OF HIGH PROFILE 
BEFORE, THAT WOULD INCLUDE BILL 
COSBY, IT WAS INTERESTING, HIS 
OWN DEFENSE TEAM POINTED TO THE 
ME TOO MOVEMENT HOPING TO MAKE 
THE CASE THIS WOULD BE A MOB 
MENTALITY IN THE EFFORT TO RETRY
HIM.
WE DO KNOW FROM THE COURTROOM 
THREE ACCUSERS BURST INTO TEARS 
AFTER THEY HEARD THE VERDICT.
WE'RE NOW GETTING REPORTS THAT 
BILL COSBY WHO SAT THERE 
LISTENED TO THE VERDICT LOOKING 
STRAIGHT AHEAD HAS NOW PUT HIS 
HEAD DOWN, HIS EYES CLOSED 
TAKING DEEP BREATHS.
WE MENTIONED THAT ANDREA 
CONSTAND NODDED HER HEAD IN 
APPROVAL WHEN SHE HEARD THE 
VERDICT THAT SHE CERTAINLY WAS 
HOPING FOR.
AGAIN, AS YOU'RE WATCHING RIGHT 
NOW, BILL COSBY FOUND GUILTY ON 
ALL THREE COUNTS IN THIS 
RETRIAL.
HE FACES UP TO TEN YEARS FOR 
EACH OF THOSE COUNTS AND QUICKLY
BEFORE WE SAY GOOD-BYE ON THIS, 
SUNNY, HE FACES TEN YEARS IN 
PRISON FOR EACH COUNT, WHAT ARE 
WE LIKELY TO SEE. 
>> YOU KNOW, HE IS AN 
80-YEAR-OLD MAN AND ANY SENTENCE
AT THIS POINT OF TEN YEARS IS A 
DEATH SENTENCE IN MY VIEW.
THE JUDGE WILL LOOK AT THE CASE,
THE JUDGE WILL LOOK AT HIS 
STATURE IN THE COMMUNITY.
THE JUDGE WILL LISTEN TO VICTIM 
IMPACT STATEMENTS.
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE 
JUDGE -- THE JUDGE HAS WIDE 
DISCRETION HERE SO WE'RE LOOKING
AT ANY AMOUNT OF TIME, IT COULD 
BE NO TIME IN PRISON OR IT COULD
BE UP TO 30 YEARS IF THE JUDGE 
DECIDES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
NEEDS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO WOMEN
IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH.
THAT YOU CAN'T DO THIS AND GET 
AWAY WIT.
HE COULD VERY WELL SPEND THE 
REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON. 
>> HOW LIKELY IS IT HE WOULDN'T 
FACE ANY PRISON TIME?
>> I HAVE TO SAY I THINK THAT'S 
VERY UNLIKELY, AGAIN, GIVEN THE 
SEVERITY OF THE CONVICTIONS 
HERE, OF THE VERDICT.
AND OF HIS ACTIONS AND THE 
MOMENT THAT WE'RE IN IN TERMS OF
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MEN AND 
AGGRESSION TOWARDS WOMEN.
I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF HE 
DID NOT SERVE ANY TIME IN PRESS 
SFLN WE DID SEE BILL COSBY'S 
WIFE LATE IN THE RETRIAL AP
APPEARING AT THE COURTHOUSE.
>> SHE CERTAINLY HAS STOOD BY 
HER HUSBAND.
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 
HIM.
I DOUBT -- I DOUBT AT THIS POINT
THAT BILL COSBY WILL WALK AWAY 
EVEN TODAY A FREE MAN.
MY GUESS IS THAT THE PROSECUTION
WILL ASK FOR HIS BAIL TO BE 
REVOKED.
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND I 
THINK HE'LL SPEND TONIGHT IN 
PRISON. 
>> ALL RIGHT, SUNNY, STICK WITH 
US HERE.
WE DO WANT TO GET TO ABC'S 
LINSEY DAVIS COVERING IT FROM 
THE START AND JOINS US FROM 
OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE.
I KNOW YOU WERE INSIDE THE 
COURTROOM.
INITIAL DESCRIPTIONS OF HIM 
LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD THEN 
PUTTING HIS HEAD DOWN TAKING 
DEEP BREATHS AS IT WAS DESCRIBED
TO US.
>> Reporter: DAVID, I AT A 
CERTAIN POINT COULDN'T EVEN FIND
WHERE HE WAS IN THE COURTROOM 
AND I HAD BEEN LOOKING RIGHT AT 
HIS FACE.
WHEN THE FIRST GUILTY CAME 
THROUGH HE JUST KIND OF DROPPED 
HIS HEAD AND THEN HE MUST HAVE 
DROPPED HIMSELF SO LOW THAT YOU 
COULDN'T EVEN SEE IT ABOVE THE 
DESK THAT WHERE HE WAS SITTING.
HE JUST DISAPPEARED.
SO I COULDN'T GIVE YOU ANY KIND 
OF REACTION OTHER THAN WHAT 
MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS SOMEONE 
WHO IS SITTING AND KIND OF 
PARTLY COLLAPSES FORWARD.
IN THE ROOM, THERE WAS 
AUDIBLE -- THERE WERE AUDIBLE 
GASPS.
THERE WERE FOUR SURVIVORS OR 
THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE 
SURVIVOR SISTERS, FOUR COSBY 
ACCUSERS, THREE OF WHOM HAVE 
BEEN HERE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR 
THE TRIAL THAT LASTED FOR 12 
DAYS PLUS THESE TWO DAYS OF 
DELIBERATIONS AND THEN LAST 
YEAR, IN JUNE, THEY WERE HERE AS
WELL.
DAY IN AND DAY OUT FOR THAT 
TRIAL.
THEY HAD TO BE ESCORTED OUT OF 
THE COURTROOM BECAUSE THEY 
SOBBED SO LOUDLY AND THEY ASKED 
TO BE ABLE TO STAY.
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO 
STOP CRYING BUT THEY HAD TO 
LEAVE.
THEY WERE OVERCOME.
THREE OF THEM THAT WERE ESCORTED
OUT, ONE WAS ABLE TO STAY BUT 
JUST OVERCOME WITH SO MUCH 
EMOTION THAT MANY OF THEM, MANY 
OF THESE ACCUSERS GOING BACK TO 
THE 1980s SAYING AND IN SOME 
CASES BEYOND THAT BUT SAYING 
THEY HAD BEEN DRUGGED AND 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY BILL 
COSBY.
>> LINSEY, AS YOU KNOW, WE HAD 
EVERY EXPECTATION THAT 
PROSECUTORS WOULD ASK ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY THAT BAIL BE 
REVOKED.
ANY WORD ON THAT?
>> WE'VE HEARD THAT THEY WILL 
ASK BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR AND IT'S 
UP TO THE JUDGE TO DECIDE, OF 
COURSE, HE'S GOING TO TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION HERE'S A MAN THAT 
IN TWO MONTHS HE'S GOING TO BE 
81 YEARS OLD.
HE'S LEGALLY BLIND AND SO HOW 
MUCH OF A THREAT TO SOCIETY IS 
HE?
CERTAINLY THESE ARE ARGUMENTS 
THAT WILL BE MADE BY TOM 
MESEREAU HIS LEAD DEFENSE 
ATTORNEY SO IT WILL BE UP TO THE
JUDGE.
WE'RE TOLD THAT SENTENCING WOULD
TAKE PLACE IN 60 TO 90 DAYS FROM
NOW. 
>> AS YOU MENTIONED HIS DEFENSE 
TEAM, THEY HAD MADE THE ARGUMENT
I MENTIONED WITH SUNNY A MOMENT 
AGO THIS ME TOO MOVEMENT THAT 
BILL COSBY IN THE RETRIAL HAD 
BEEN SWEPT UP IN THAT QUESTIONS 
YEAR'S JURY WAS ASKING AS FAR AS
WHAT'S THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF 
CONSENT.
WE JUST HAD NO IDEA.
BUT, WHAT I WILL SAY, THE 
LARGE -- TWO LARGE FACTORS HERE,
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAST TRIAL 
AND THIS TRIAL, OF COURSE, AS 
YOU MENTIONED WE'RE NOW IN THE 
ME TOO MOVEMENT ERA BUT ALSO 
THAT YOU HEARD FROM THOSE FIVE 
ADDITIONAL ACCUSERS THIS GO 
ROUND.
WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVED 
ANDREA CONSTAND YOU HAD THOSE 
FIVE OTHER WOMEN SAYING, YES, IT
HAPPENED TO ME TOO.
WITH VERY SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS 
IN MANY CASES USED THE SAME 
WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY FELT 
AFTER THEY SAY THEY HAD BEEN 
DRUGGED AND HOW THEY SAY THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED.
SO WHILE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
BACK IN 2005 HAD SAID INITIALLY 
HE HADN'T CHARGED BILL COSBY 
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT ANDREA 
CONSTAND HAD RUINED HER OWN 
CREDIBILITY AND WOULD NOT BE 
BELIEVED BY A JURY, HERE YOU 
HAVE -- HE'S PROVEN WRONG TODAY 
AND GUILTY ON ALL THREE COUNTS.
>> LINSEY, WITH JUST A FEW 
MOMENTS LAST WAS CAMILLE COSBY 
IN THE COURTROOM, HIS WIFE?
>> CAMILLE COSBY WAS NOT IN THE 
COURTROOM.
SHE ONLY APPEARED ON THE DAY OF 
THE DEFENSE'S CLOSING ARGUMENT. 
>> LINSEY DAVIS COVERING THIS 
CASE AND THE PREVIOUS TRIAL, OUR
THANKS TO YOU AND SUNNY HOSTIN 
HERE WATCHING THIS WITH ME.
AGAIN, BILL COSBY FOUND GUILTY 
ON ALL COUNTS IN THE RETRIAL 
MOMENTS AGO.
HE DOES FACE THE REAL 
POSSIBILITY OF LIVING OUT THE 
REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON AND 
WE STILL AWAIT WORD ON WHETHER 
OR NOT PROSECUTORS WILL ASK TO 
REVOKE BAIL THOUGH THAT IS 
EXPECTED AND VERY SOON.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE COMING UP 
LATER ON ON ABC'S "WORLD NEWS 
TONIGHT."
UNTIL THEN I'M DAVID MUIR IN NEW
YORK.
GOOD DAY.
