CEO of gilt groupe the leading player in

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,550
a new e-commerce market casually

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,230
referred to as private<font color="#E5E5E5"> sales Susan</font>

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,880

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,439

extraordinary second thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font>

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,420
coming there what is gilt groupe so

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,820
guilt is as you said private sales think

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,579
of it as almost sample sales online so

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,149
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day at noon we open a new set of</font>

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,370
sales literally we change out the store

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,149
overnight so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we may launch 15 new</font>

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,340
sales today between our women's business

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,329
our men's business our home business and

16
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,289
they are deeply discounted it's it's a

17
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,750
way for brands to deal with their their

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,239
excess goods in a way that's very brand

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,640
appropriate very discreet and it works

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,369
and it's more than women's fashion

21
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,170
actually was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning so describes a</font>

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,320
man's business<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so I we saw we had</font>

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,610
a pretty strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> men's membership group</font>

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,350
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty percent of our overall</font>

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,250
membership and we decided about two

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,020
months ago we would spin it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out into its</font>

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,070
own store and do more you know not just

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,630
apparel but gear gadgets stuff that guys

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,810
covered right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really on fire</font>

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,890
and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are bananas about this I mean</font>

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,180
I've heard some stories about the

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">average customers whatever but you had</font>

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,939
some customers who spent almost a

34
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,890
million dollars on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site and so are</font>

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,380
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally addicted to it said</font>

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,680
where do we have a top<font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent that</font>

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,380
is just incredibly active they spend an

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,689
enormous amount money I mean I've never

39
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,890
seen these kind of numbers before so

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,780
there's there's an interesting

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,380
membership you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of it is</font>

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,479
women men between 20 and 30 who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

43
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,270
their first or second real jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

44
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,020
they're very brands

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,690
Abby and this is their<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

46
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,490
brands they otherwise would not be able

47
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,170
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> access they want the stuff they just</font>

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,060
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay full price or they can't</font>

49
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,950
right there they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not at that</font>

50
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,990
place and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the perception</font>

51
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of a closeout</font>

52
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,440
business and we've seen over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> history</font>

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Internet companies and so forth you</font>

54
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a lot of clothes out businesses that</font>

55
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,640
grow tremendously rapidly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning because they're buying small</font>

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,140
lots everybody wants them are you going

58
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,820
to suddenly hit a wall when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to</font>

59
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,770
500 million or a billion where you can't

60
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,600
find enough stuff well first of all

61
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,170
there's a lot of stuff but we're also

62
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,770
doing an increasing amount of what we

63
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,280
sell is goods that's actually cut

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,140
especially for guilt so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

65
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,710
access a lot of these brands are now

66
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,440
looking at us not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a way to move</font>

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,300
excess goods but as a marketing vehicle

68
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,550
we've got a great membership base and

69
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,980
it's a way for them to get their product

70
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,370
and their look in front of an enormous

71
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of new customers who may buy full</font>

72
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,140
price too and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

73
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,640
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of outlet malls</font>

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,140
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in summer but they actually are</font>

75
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,720
having stuff made yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes absolute</font>

76
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,120
stud misconception so how big do you

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,080
think it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get I think that we won't</font>

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,940
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for a long time you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font>

79
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see any limits on it right</font>

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,600
now will grow four fold this year it's

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,470
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big big business and</font>

82
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,680
it's it's not just because it's discount

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,470
it's because it's fun you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people</font>

84
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">really engage in it there is a come a</font>

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,910
competitive aspect to this that is

86
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,610
unlike normal shopping so is the early

87
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,240
ebay experience for ya exactly exactly

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
except there's also instant

89
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,820
gratification because you get to buy it

90
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,650
now that's right you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price</font>

91
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,959
is anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else any concern on the part</font>

92
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,900
of the manufacturers or Amazon or

93
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,400
something like that that this is going

94
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,780
to become that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's just going to</font>

95
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,580
shop private sales why would you go walk

96
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,730
into sacks anymore you know no because I

97
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that that this has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

98
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,228
forever on some level there there there

99
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:22,690
are TJ maxx's out there everywhere you

100
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:22,930
know

101
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're there have always been outlet</font>

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,580
stores and I think the way we do it is

103
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,300
very brand supportive so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

104
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting people used to buying off price</font>

105
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,610
it's really engaging you with a brand

106
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,669
and a brand story so we believe we are

107
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,770
actually supporting their full price

108
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,870
businesses we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact because</font>

109
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,750
when we do a sale people go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

110
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,930
website of that brand so there's a

111
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,979
there's a good kick back impact as well

112
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,680
and future plans for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company you're</font>

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to go public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next year yeah</font>

114
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,470
obviously the revenue base to do it well

115
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">in all things in good time but right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

116
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,669
we're just really focused on growth and

117
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,240
we've got a lot of runway here and we

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that we stay</font>

119
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">focused on what we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

120
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on on the public markets for</font>

121
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,750
a while and is does the growth look like

122
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,460
the early e-commerce growth where

123
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,360
companies were growing incredibly

124
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,729
rapidly but just hemorrhaging hundreds

125
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:25,990
of millions of dollars this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font>

126
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive business are you there are</font>

127
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,120
it's a complex business you know we take

128
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,010
inventory on about seventy percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

129
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,400
what we sell so there's a there's a

130
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,590
warehousing component there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

131
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,099
complex operational component to it as i

132
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,659
said we change out the store every night

133
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,370
so we're bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a hundred thousand</font>

134
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,840
units and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> shipping out a hundred</font>

135
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,780
thousand units and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

136
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,030
complex tech aspect to it too because

137
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,159
people come at the same time and they

138
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,020
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to cart at the same time and</font>

139
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">they want to check out at the same time</font>

140
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,320
so it's an easy category to enter it's a

141
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,470
very hard category to scale and that

142
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,419
said suddenly it seems that this year

143
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,159
everybody in their brothers<font color="#CCCCCC"> discovery</font>

144
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a great business five</font>

145
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,400
competitors you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the time</font>

146
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,349
i get emails pretty much every week

147
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:15,849
about a new one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a different sector</font>

148
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,400
and what have you yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody scaring</font>

149
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,020
you on that or they big I mean you're

150
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leader ya know I we keep our eyes on</font>

151
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,979
them but as I said I worry far less

152
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,849
about companies where this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not their</font>

153
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,070
primary business because it is a very

154
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,200
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> business model and anyone who</font>

155
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,680
is in

156
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,550
full price e-commerce or has a store

157
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,990
this is radically different we do change

158
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,729
out the store every night so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

159
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,060
it very complex for someone who who is

160
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to having a set number of skews in</font>

161
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,160
inventory they reorder when it's time to

162
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,990
that's not this business so when we hear

163
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,520
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> department stores getting into it</font>

164
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,330
or we hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know small little</font>

165
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,070
shops getting into it we're not really

166
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,639
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and international</font>

167
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,500
Japan yeah they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in France there</font>

168
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,330
already was a huge one more day which

169
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,860
was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inspirations yeah company</font>

170
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">so would you go elsewhere Europe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jairam</font>

171
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,220
very possibly I were not immediately

172
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but we're certainly</font>

173
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,349
keeping our our eyes open and looking at

174
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:28,750
at other potential markets no question

175
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,120
amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> just bought Zappos for a billion</font>

176
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars they do you fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into that will</font>

177
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,639
they come in knock<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your door no we</font>

178
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,380
don't know there's is obviously interest

179
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,409
every major e-commerce company i think

180
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,229
is keeping their eyes on the space

181
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,840
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is engaging enormous numbers</font>

182
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,639
of people and and when you see

183
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,000
engagement levels like that you want to

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,870
understand it but right now as I said

185
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're really focused on just making our</font>
