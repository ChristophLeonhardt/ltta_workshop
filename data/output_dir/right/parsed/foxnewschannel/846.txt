HOWIE: THERE IS NO QUESTION KIM
JONG-UN IS A BRUTAL RULER.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DETRACTORS IN
THE MEDIA WERE QUICK TO
CRITICIZE THE PRAISE HE HAD FOR
THE DICTATOR.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE'S GOT A VERY
GOOD PERSONALITY.
HE'S FUN CRANE VERY VERY SMART.
HE'S A GREAT NEGOTIATOR.
HE HAS A GREAT PERSONALITY, A
VERY SMART GUY.
HE LOVES HIS PEOPLE.
HOWIE: SEVERAL JOURNALISTS
PRESSING HIM INCLUDING BRET
BAIER.
BRET: YOU CALL PEOPLE SOMETIMES
KILLERS.
HE IS A KILLER.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HE HAS DONE
SOME REALLY BAD THINGS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: BUT SO HAVE
OTHER PEOPLE DONE SOME VERY BAD
THINGS.
HOWIE: SOME PEOPLE ON THE LEFT
ARE UPSET THAT HE MET WITH THIS
GUY.
MOLLIE: IT'S HARD TO HEAR THE
PRESIDENT PRAISE SOMEBODY LIKE
THIS.
BUT IT'S WORTH KEEPING IT IN
CONTEXT.
WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WAS
BASHING KIM A YEAR AGO WHEN HE
WAS IN SEOUL WHEN HE GAVE THE
SPEECH THAT TOOK HIM DOWN A
NOTCH.
FLATTERY IS A TOOL WHEN DEALING
WITH SOMETHING LIKE NUCLEAR
DISARMAMENT.
EVEN IF THAT REQUIRE SOS
FLATTERY OF A DICTATOR RATHER
THAN MAKE THIS THE TIME TO TALK
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.
HOWIE: PRESIDENT OBAMA WASN'T
CRITICIZED FOR HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH CUBA.
MARIE: THE RELATIONSHIP CANS IN
THE PRESS WERE CRITICAL OF THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DURING THE
IRAN NEGOTIATION.
SOME OF THOSE SAME COMMENTATORS
ARE NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT
DONALD TRUMP.
HOWIE: IT SOUNDS LIKE TO IS
HYPOCRISY ON BOTH SIDES.
MARIE: HIS LANGUAGE WAS SO
EXTREME, LITTLE ROCKETMAN, FIRE
AND FURY.
FLATTERY CAN BE PART OF
DIPLOMACY.
BUT IT'S SO STRIKING, ESPECIALLY
ALLIES.
HOWIE: AREN'T THERE LOTS OF
LEGITIMATE CRITICISM BEING MADE.
ALL TO BE NEGOTIATED, THE
PRESIDENT DIDN'T GET MUCH OF A
TURN.
>> I THINK THE QUESTION
JOURNALISTS ARE ASKING IS WORTH
DIPLOMACY.
HOWIE: HAVING A MEETING NO OTHER
PRESIDENT HAS TALKED TO IS
DIPLOMATIC.
SARA: IT SAYS THEY ARE GOING TO
DENUCLEARIZE.
THAT WAS NOT POINT OF THIS.
IT WAS TO GET NORTH KOREA TOP
DENUCLEARIZE.
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS
THE FIRST STEP.
SOME OF THIS CRITICISM COMES
FROM THE RIGHT.
BLOGGER ERIC ERICKSON WROTE THAT
TRUMP AN TAGNIZED THE G-7 THEN
MADE KISSY FACE WITH KIM
JONG-UN.
IF OBAMA HAD DONE THAT THE
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE DEMANDING
HIS IMPEACHMENT.
MOLLIE: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE INTERVENTIONIST TYPE AND
THOSE TIRED OF THAT APPROACH TO
FOREIGN POLICY.
YOU SAW PEOPLE CRITICIZE OBAMA
MEETING WITH CASTRO.
THERE IS ANOTHER STREAM THAT
DOESN'T GET A LOT OF COVERAGE
WHICH IS A MORE REALIST APPROACH
TO FOREIGN POLICY.
ONE THING ABOUT THE MEDIA'S
CRITICISM OF THE PRAISE OF KIM.
IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO
BELIEVE THEY WERE GENUINE IF
THEY HADN'T SPENT THE OLYMPIC
PRAISING THE SISTER OF KIM.
HOWIE: SOME OF THE PRESIDENT WAS
JUST PERSONAL.
TRUMP WAS INCOHERENT, TRUMP WAS
NAIVE.
TRUMP WAS HOODWINKED.
IT JUST REMINDS ME HOW VISCERAL
SOME OF THE COMMENTS ARE.
MARIE: WE HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT
COMMENTATORS.
YOU CAN CRITICIZE THE STATEMENT
FOR BEING VAGUE, SHORT ON
SPECIFICS.
WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET
INTO PERSONAL ATTACKS.
DONALD TRUMP MAKES SO MUCH OF
HIS ATTACKS AND COMMENTARY VERY
PERSONAL.
WE ARE LIVING IN THIS AGE WHERE
HIS LANGUAGE FEELS SO PERSONAL.
WE IN THE MEDIA HAVE TO MAKE
SURE WE ARE FOCUSING ON
SUBSTANCE.
>> DOES THE MEDIA FALL INTO THE
TRAP OF USING EXTREME TERMS.
>> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE.
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE SAW A
LOT IN THE WAY THE PRESIDENT WAS
HANDLING DIPLOMACY.
HOWIE: THE PRESIDENT HAD A LIGHT
MOMENT IN WHICH HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT KIM JONG-UN.
>> HE'S THE STRONG MAN.
HE SPEAKS AND HIS PEOPLE SIT UP
AT ATTENTION.
I WANT MY PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME.
HOWIE: THAT WAS A JOKE, YET IT
BECAME THE LEAD IN THE
"WASHINGTON POST."
HE WAS NOT SERIOUS.
LET'S -- THERE HE SAYS A LOT OF
