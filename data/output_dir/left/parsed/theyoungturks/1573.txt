A SINGLE UNEMPLOYED FATHER
FROM THE BRONX ONE $5
MILLION TO THE LOTTERY FROM JUST
A SCRATCH OFF TICKET BUT HE
DOESN'T REALLY WANT ANYONE TO
KNOW ABOUT IT.
HOWEVER, THAT IS
IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE NEW
YORK'S LOTTERY.
HERE IS
WHAT 
IS GOING ON.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE?
SHOULD
HE REMAIN ANONYMOUS?
YES. 100%.
I THINK IT SHOULD BE OPTIONAL.
WHAT IS THIS ARCHAIC OBLIGATION
TO REVEAL YOURSELF?
BECAUSE OF THE GIANT CHECK,
MAX.
THAT IS THE REASON, BECAUSE A
PR.
THEY WANT YOU TO GET OUT
THERE AND SELL THE DREAM,
BECAUSE OF COURSE, THE
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
DON'T WHEN.
EVERYONE ELSE DOES
NOT WIN.
YOUR ODDS ARE NOT VERY
GOOD, BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE GUY
WITH THE GIANT CHECK ON TV IT
SEEMS LIKE, THAT GUY LOOKS
LIKE A REGULAR GUY JUST
LIKE ME, I COULD WIN.
AND THEN OF COURSE THAT IS HOW
THEY MAKE MONEYÃ– THEY MAKE
A TON OF MONEY, THAT IS WHAT
THEY DO THE LOTTERIES.
THIS STORY IMMEDIATELY
REMINDED ME OF THE PEOPLE WHO
THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO POST
THEIR LUXURY ITEMS ON SOCIAL
MEDIA.
THE PEOPLE WHO POST
PICTURES OF THEIR CASH OR THEIR
FANCY WATCHES, WHATEVER IT IS
AND THEN A WEEK OR TWO LATER YOU
READ A STORY ABOUT HOW THEY GOT
ROBBED BECAUSE THEY WERE
FLAUNTING THEIR CASH.
THE
REASON I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IS
ANYONE WHO THINKS AHEAD WOULDN'T
WANT EVERYONE KNOWING WHAT THEY
HAVE.
I WOULD WANT TO KEEP IT TO
MYSELF, I AM NOT GOING TO FLAUNT
MY LUXURY ITEMS ARE TALK ABOUT
HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE, THAT IS
CRAZY.
YOU COULD BECOME A TARGET
AND BY THE WAY, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF ISSUES HE HAS HAD
WITH PEOPLE IN THE PAST.
HE
JUST DOES NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH
THAT KIND OF CONFLICT AND I
THINK THAT SHOULD BE HIS RIGHT.
HE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED IN
DOING THIS RIDICULOUS PRESS
CONFERENCE.
I TOTALLY AGREE.
IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE IN OTHER
STATES HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT
AS WELL WITH A LOT OF MONEY,
MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS
SO I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT
THING TO DISTINGUISH.
I WAS GOING TO NAME MYSELF TO
CHANGE BUT THEN I REALIZED
PEOPLE WITH THE KNOW I HAVE TWO
CHAINS AND THAT WOULD BE A
PROBLEM.
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU
REALLY QUICK.
LET'S SAY YOU ARE
THE WINNER, $5 MILLION, ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS
CASH.
OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO COME OUT OF THE
WOODWORK AND GIVE YOU SUB-
STORIES, CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME
OUT, I DON'T KNOW, MY CAT BROKE
ITS LEG, WHATEVER IT IS BUT
LET'S SAY IT'S A SERIOUS
PROBLEM, SOMEONE HAS
MEDICAL BILLS TO BE PAID.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU ARE KIND OF LIKE CHEAP.
I WAS WONDERING WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT.
I AM JUST CURIOUS.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED THE
YOUNG TURKS I WAS VERY BAD AS
SAYING NO.
I HAVE GOTTEN MUCH
BETTER.
YOU WERE BAD AT SAYING NO AT
SOME POINT?
YEAH.
I FELT BAD EVERY TIME,
OH YOU WANT TO DO THAT, SURE,
LET'S DO IT.
I THINK THAT IS A
BAD IDEA, BUT LET'S DO IT.
IN
MY PERSONAL LIFE TOO.
IN ALL
HONESTY, I HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN
TO PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE THEY WON
THE LOTTERY BUT BECAUSE THEY ONE
WOUND UP IN A JOB OR THEY GOT A
LOT OF MONEY AND PEOPLE
DEFINITELY COME OUT OF THE
WOODWORK.
IF YOU HAVE NEVER
SEEN YOUR SECOND COUSINS, WIN
THE LOTTERY, THEY ARE COMING
YOUR WAY.
ANNA HIT ON THE MOST
DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE PEOPLE,
AND THEY GO I GOT THIS GREAT
IDEA FOR A BUSINESS AND IT IS
GOING TO BE A FLOATING COUCH IN
CASE IT FLOODS, AND THAT IS
RELATIVELY EASY.
NO. AND
THEN YOU WILL GET, MY KID NEEDS
TO GO TO SCHOOL.
YEAH, EVERYBODY'S KID NEEDS TO
GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY ARE ALL
$200,000.
THAT IS A MEDIUM KNOW.
THEN SOMEBODY COMES AND SAYS, MY
AUNT HAS CANCER.
HOW DO YOU SAY NO TO THAT?
THERE IS NO GOOD ANSWER TO
THAT SO THIS GUY IS LIKE I DO
NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR
AUNT.
MEANWHILE THE NEWS ARTICLE
HAS A PHOTO OF HIM.
THEY BLURRED IT, SO I CAN SEE
WHEN HE LOOKS LIKE EXCEPT HE
LOOKS LIKE THE JOKER.
TAKE HIS FACE AND'S MOTION
WITH THE JOKER FROM BATMAN.
PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM DEFINITELY
ARE GOING TO DO THAT IS.
