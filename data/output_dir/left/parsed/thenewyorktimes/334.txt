“Good afternoon.
On my orders, the United States
military has begun strikes
against Al Qaeda
terrorist training camps
and military installations
of the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan.”
That was the start
of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.
“We need the freedom to operate
on the ground and in the air.”
It’s now America’s longest
war — almost 6,000 days long, in fact.
Yet few battles or notable
events from Afghanistan
have taken root in
America’s collective memory.
And that means fewer
signposts to mark
the long passage of time.
But if we look at how
long it took to reach
seminal moments in other wars,
it might bring America’s 16-plus-year presence in Afghanistan
into clear view.
We’ll start with the
Battle of Gettysburg.
This bar represents the
number of days the U.S. has
been fighting in Afghanistan.
The fighting at Gettysburg began
811 days into the Civil War.
Many consider this the
most important battle
of the conflict.
And it took place after
half the war was fought.
Now apply it to
Afghanistan time.
It would bring us to
just Dec. 27, 2003.
There were about 13,000
American troops in Afghanistan back then.
That number would
eventually peak at 100,000.
“In England, General Dwight D. Eisenhower
and his deputy commanders
chart the liberation
of a lost continent.”
Then there’s the Allied
D-Day invasion at Normandy.
One of the most iconic
moments of World War II.
The culmination of
extensive planning in years
of fighting in Northern
Africa, Italy and elsewhere.
That invasion began 913 days
after America entered the war.
In Afghanistan time,
that brings us to
just April 4, 2004.
Hamid Karzai hadn’t even
been elected as president
of Afghanistan yet.
And when World War
II neared its end
with the atomic bombing
of Hiroshima, that
came after 1,339 days of
battle. In Afghanistan time,
that would reach to June 2005.
Not even a quarter of
the way through.
Vietnam was America’s
second-longest war.
And the final pivotal
moment was the fall
of Saigon in April 1975.
That occurred 3,706 days
after U.S. Marines landed
in Da Nang in 1965.
And in a final comparison
to Afghanistan time,
that would bring us
to Nov. 30, 2011.
Osama bin Laden was killed
about six months earlier.
And President Obama had
already announced plans
to completely
withdraw U.S. troops.
He would later
reverse that decision.
The Obama and Trump
administrations
would unveil new strategies –
continuing the fight, which
goes on to this day.
