1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:01,646
FACTS INSTEAD OF RHETORIC,

2
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:01,947
SEAN.

3
00:00:01,947 --> 00:00:03,648
>> Sean: ED HENRY AT THE

4
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:04,349
WHITE HOUSE, MAYBE HE SHOULD

5
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:05,784
READ THE CONSTITUTION, SOMETHING

6
00:00:05,784 --> 00:00:07,519
ABOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES.

7
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,320
THAT IS PART OF IT.

8
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,690
JOINING US WITH MORE REACTION,

9
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,061
RON DeSANTIS, TV CONTRIBUTOR,

10
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:17,862
FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT DAN

11
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:18,763
BONGINO, I AGREE WITH

12
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:21,633
GREGG JARRETT, DAVID SHOWING, GO

13
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,468
TO VENT ABOUT, CONGRESSMAN, I

14
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:25,003
AGREE WITH ALAN DERSHOWITZ.

15
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:28,640
THIS IS A PERJURY TRAP, IT IS

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,407
JUVENILE, THE FACT THAT YOU ASK

17
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:32,009
THE PRESIDENT WHAT WAS IN YOUR

18
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,678
MIND IS IN ABSURDITY, AND IT

19
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:37,949
SHOWS JUST HOW FAR THIS HAS GONE

20
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:40,418
FROM SO-CALLED COLLUSION WITH

21
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:40,752
RUSSIA.

22
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:42,053
>> YOU ARE RIGHT, SEAN, VERY FEW

23
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:45,290
OF THE BULLETS INVOLVED A

24
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,824
CAMPAIGN.

25
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,825
IT WAS MOSTLY DURING THE

26
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:48,460
TRANSITION AND THEN DURING THE

27
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,027
PRESIDENCY.

28
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,695
SO YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

29
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:53,164
ROBERT MUELLER, HE IS A DOJ

30
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:54,499
EMPLOYEE, EFFECTIVELY.

31
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,501
HE HAS AN INFERIOR OFFICER IN

32
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:57,636
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

33
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:00,238
WHAT GIVES HIM THE RIGHT TO

34
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:01,573
CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OVER BASIC

35
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:02,273
PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS?

36
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:04,843
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY

37
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:05,844
TYPE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

38
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:08,580
WHAT WAS IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU

39
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,148
TALKED ABOUT JEFF SESSIONS WERE

40
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:11,282
ASSIGNING OR THIS OR THAT?

41
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,018
HE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO

42
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,486
SUBPOENA THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT,

43
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:16,121
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT SUBMIT

44
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:16,655
TO THOSE QUESTIONS.

45
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:18,456
AND I AGREE WITH ALAN DERSHOWITZ

46
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:20,492
AND YOU, SEAN, I THINK THAT

47
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:22,460
REALLY THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO

48
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,663
INVESTIGATE A CRIME, THEY ARE

49
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:26,431
TRYING TO MANUFACTURE A

50
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:26,931
PROCESSED CRIME.

51
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:28,233
>> Sean: DAN BONGINO, NO GOOD

52
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,567
LAWYER IN THE RIGHT MIND KNOWING

53
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,103
WHAT WE KNOW, KNOWING THE

54
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:33,238
ABUSIVELY BIASED TEAM LIKE

55
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,840
WISEMAN AND COMPANY THAT WAS

56
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,609
APPOINTED BY MUELLER, WOULD

57
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:38,877
ANY PRESENT DENT LET HIM GO

58
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:41,046
BEFORE THE MAN AT ALL?

59
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:45,283
AND THE THREATS OF THE PRESIDENT

60
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:46,384
EARLY IN THE PROCESS BEFORE THEY

61
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:49,421
COOPERATED AND NEVER EXECUTIVE

62
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:50,488
PRIVILEGE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

63
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:52,424
>> DO YOU SEE THE DANGER IN

64
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:53,024
THIS?

65
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:54,926
THEY ARE NOT INVESTIGATING A

66
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:55,827
CRIME HERE.

67
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:56,628
THEY ARE INVESTIGATING

68
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:57,062
DONALD TRUMP.

69
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,998
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

70
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:01,099
I WAS A FORMER FEDERAL AGENT,

71
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,233
YOU INVESTIGATE A CRIME AND YOU

72
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,201
FIND PEOPLE.

73
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,669
YOU DO NOT FIND PEOPLE AND THEN

74
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,204
GO FIND THE CRIME.

75
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,440
I READ THE QUESTIONS, AND SEAN,

76
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,407
THESE QUESTIONS ARE VERY

77
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:10,407
STRATEGIC.

78
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:12,243
NOTICE HOW THEY ARE LEFT

79
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:12,844
OPEN-ENDED.

80
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,479
NOW RON IS A LAWYER, HE CAN TELL

81
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:14,946
YOU THAT'S TOO.

82
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:16,815
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU

83
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:19,084
INTERVIEW PEOPLE AS A FEDERAL

84
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:20,018
AGENT.

85
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:20,585
OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS.

86
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,620
>> Sean: NO YES OR NO

87
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,221
QUESTIONS.

88
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,057
>> EXACTLY, BINGO.

89
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:28,259
>> Sean: IF THERE IS ONE THING

90
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,895
THAT DEVIATES AND YOU ARE ON A

91
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,964
WITCH HUNT, THERE IS NO

92
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:35,233
PROSECUTORIAL DISCUSSION, THE

93
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,402
ONLY WAY HE GETS THAT IS

94
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:38,236
HILLARY CLINTON, THE RIGGED

95
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:39,003
INVESTIGATION.

96
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:40,271
THE HILLARY STANDARD IS NOT

97
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:42,440
GOING TO APPLY FOR DONALD TRUMP

98
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,708
WITH ROBERT MUELLER AND HIS

99
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:47,011
MERRY BAN OF DEMOCRATIC DONORS

100
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,446
AND PEOPLE THAT WITHHOLD

101
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:49,180
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE LIKE ANDREW

102
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,647
WEISSMANN.

103
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,549
NO, HE IS NOT GOING -- HE WILL

104
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:57,021
BE UNDER OATH UNDER LIKE

105
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:58,623
HILLARY, NOT A FRIEND

106
00:02:58,623 --> 00:02:59,324
INTERVIEWING HIM LIKE HILLARY

107
00:02:59,324 --> 00:02:59,624
HAD.

108
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,726
IT IS SO FLAGRANT HERE, DO WE

109
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:03,228
HAVE EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE

110
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,028
LAW?

111
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,063
DO WE HAVE TO EQUAL APPLICATION

112
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,699
UNDER THE LAW OR NOT IN THIS

113
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,032
COUNTRY?

114
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,267
>> JUST THE FACT THAT THESE

115
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,402
QUESTIONS ARE BEING GENERATED,

116
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,871
WAS THERE A COPIOUS NUMBER OF

117
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,706
QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED OF

118
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:17,008
HILLARY AND HER FBI INTERVIEW?

119
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,009
THAT WAS A PERFUNCTORY THING.

120
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:18,943
THEY HAVE ALREADY DECIDED NOT TO

121
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:22,213
BRING CHARGES.

122
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:23,815
COMEY WROTE THE MEMO TWO MONTHS

123
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:24,983
BEFORE THEY EVEN INTERVIEWED

124
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:25,850
HER.

125
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,386
SO THE LACK OF ZEALOUSNESS AND

126
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:30,421
THEN THE OVERZEALOUSNESS HERE IS

127
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:31,189
VERY, VERY STRIKING.

128
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:32,624
AND LOOK, IT SHOULD BE

129
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,058
CONCERNING TO ALL OF US.

130
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,326
THAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH

131
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:36,094
THE INVESTIGATION IS THAT THEY

132
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,529
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO NAIL

133
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:39,030
ANYTHING THEY CAN TO THE WALL

134
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,632
AND OF COURSE YOU AND I AND

135
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:42,333
AGAIN, WE ALL WATCH THE HILLARY

136
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,502
CASE WHERE THEY DID NOT GO

137
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:45,103
AFTER BLEACH BIT.

138
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:47,839
THEY DID NOT TO GO AFTER PUMA OR

139
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,174
ANY OF IT.

140
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,242
>> Sean: AND HOW DOES ROD

141
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,178
ROSENSTEIN, ONE PERSON THAT

142
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:57,615
SIGNS OFF ON A DOSSIER MANDATED

143
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:58,550
APPLICATION TO A IS A COURTS

144
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,152
WHEN THEY ARE IN LINE WITH THE

145
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,888
FISA JUDGES, HOW DOES HE NOT

146
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,390
RECUSE HIMSELF?

147
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,090
WHERE IS JEFF SESSIONS SAYING

148
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,058
THAT YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE BEEN IN

149
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:09,060
THIS?

150
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,861
A GET OUT!

151
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,197
>> SEAN, ROD ROSENSTEIN IS THE

152
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,198
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY IN IN

153
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,633
MARYLAND ON THE URANIUM ONE

154
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:16,401
PRECURSOR CASE.

155
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:18,036
THIS GUY IS SO CONFLICTED, HOW

156
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:22,440
HE HAS NOT RECUSE HIMSELF OR

157
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,041
REDESIGNED IS AMAZING.

158
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,743
>> Sean: WHEN HE SAID, OH,

159
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,179
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IF THERE IS

160
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:29,781
FALSE INFORMATION ON A FISA

161
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:31,783
APPLICATION PERIOD HE SIGNED ONE

162
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:33,418
THAT WAS NOT TO VERIFIED OR

163
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:34,152
COOPERATED AND HILLARY PAID FOR

164
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:36,221
IT AND THEY NEVER TOLD THE

165
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:36,521
JUDGE.

166
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,224
>> HE NEEDS TO GET OFF THIS CASE

167
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:39,691
LIKE YESTERDAY.

168
00:04:39,691 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: FULL DISCLOSURE, I DO
