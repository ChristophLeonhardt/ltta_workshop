the cyclicals the Zoom Zoom ah you see
practical vision Sipapu the taeho
history al Qaeda na nanana nanana nanan
not to compare Kodama largest volcano
but the parvenu to it dishonesty
we just got cyfle tower it's just been
closed the second time since the attacks
has been closed for security reasons
France just announced that 115,000
security forces will be dispatched
across the country I can already see
some soldiers on the ground I mean this
is one of the most crowded symbolic
areas in France to see it so deserted
it's very sad secretary Parveen messy
excuse me what's going on security
problem so it's been closed
yeah they bought it go so we don't know
what's happening but we hear there's a
security risk and we're being evacuated
out of the area we actually came for the
u2 concert which was canceled and then
yeah so today we came to see dr. power
and so we're not giving up
so eventually it'll open and we'll get
to go in it's certainly been a trip of a
lifetime
I'm sure how do you guys feel being
tourists after the attack we had 9/11
how we felt we actually went yesterday
to flowers and went on the different
sites in life flowers and just spent
some time just really morning
you can't hide away
so you can fold
live in Liberty regardless so that's
that's what we're doing today so we're
gonna push you even further back away
from the Eiffel Tower right now what's
happening here there was there was a
boxer that will order what happened we
are from India we are from you know we
have seen what has happened
many years back and you think this is a
part of our new reality that like this
is there might be bomb alerts there
might be like false alarms we discussed
continued this is this is I mean we
should now understand this is a new
global reality at least from where I
come from in the world we have been
facing all these issues
things are quieting down now we just got
off the phone the Paris police they have
nothing to confirm yet but it seems like
it might have been a scare since the
attack never been many of these the
whole city is very tense
so we're walking in the area where the
attacks happened there's a huge memorial
site here with lots of flowers and
candles and more very silent we're going
to be headed to a sports bar on the
corner because France is playing tonight
another soccer match and we're gonna see
how the mood is and if people feel
confident to return to this area again
do you have like any like hesitation or
second thoughts before coming like a
little fear no I'm not scared because
each step in a long time you can't
the second time and if you're scared you
do nothing in your life so do you know
anyone was answer yes are they okay
some yes some not I think everybody
everybody in Paris or in France know
someone who knows someone who was close
to here there was a lot of people who
died is it strange to be out and about
in this neighborhood only just a few
days ago a terrorist attack happened
again it's so weird looks everything
looks different everything looks strange
it likes it has a really strange
atmosphere and you know that something
happened
everybody's kind yeah yes I think
everybody it's more like Union
we know from this morning's raised that
several have been arrested a woman blew
herself up with a suicide vest and at
the moment that area has been completely
sealed off and evacuated
so what would you here this morning but
very could cut Hawkins or not only could
feel welcome to Napa Valley person
