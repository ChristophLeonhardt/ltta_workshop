1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,710
These four American Green
Berets were killed last fall

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,980
when their patrol was
ambushed in Niger.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,360
The Defense Department
launched an investigation

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,810
into what happened.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,950
But helmet camera footage
from one of the soldiers

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,590
allowed us to reconstruct
some of the attack.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,400
It’s the morning
of Oct. 4, 2017.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,820
A convoy of around eight
American and Nigerien army

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,434
vehicles leaves the
village of Tongo Tongo

10
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:34,020
after a mission in the area.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,990
They’re quickly
ambushed by militants

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,180
loyal to Islamic State.

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,360
Footage of that fight shows
that two American vehicles

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,490
are separated from the convoy.

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,700
The others had fled or were hit.

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,310
We see seven soldiers
taking cover.

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,230
The attackers are
somewhere in this area.

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,510
An American soldier we believe
to be Staff Sergeant Jeremiah

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,340
Johnson wearing a helmet
camera enters the white vehicle

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,880
and drives it a short distance.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,720
He steps out and begins
firing towards the tree line.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,990
Then, he runs for cover
behind the white vehicle,

23
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,440
and the video cuts
to a new scene.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,070
Next, we only see the black
car and three soldiers —

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,310
Staff Sergeants Johnson,
Wright, and Black.

26
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,680
The white car has
disappeared, and we don’t

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,890
know how much time has elapsed.

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,740
Wright drives the car toward
the mark of a red smoke grenade.

29
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,370
The smoke could be to mask their
movements from the militants,

30
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,820
or to mark their position
for supporting units.

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,830
Johnson, taking
cover at the rear,

32
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,090
fires toward the tree line.

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,970
After they’ve reached the smoke,
there’s a cut in the video.

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,030
In the next scene, the
red smoke has cleared.

35
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,330
The car begins to move again,
when Johnson and Black fall.

36
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,880
Black is unresponsive.

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,100
Johnson regains his footing.

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,410
He moves forward and
starts searching.

39
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,070
It could be for support
or for the enemy.

40
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,610
Wright then drags Black
to cover, behind the car.

41
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,480
He aims back towards
the treeline.

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
The scene ends.

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,840
The militants are closing in.

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,970
We don’t know how much
time has passed here,

45
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,940
but Wright changes
his direction of fire.

46
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,480
He and Johnson begin running
without covering each other.

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,420
This suggests they’re
about to be overrun.

48
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,060
The situation is too desperate.

49
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,650
There are more
edits to the video,

50
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,470
but we’re able to map
their final steps.

51
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,740
Johnson is seriously wounded
and falls, but then moves

52
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,900
about another 40 feet.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,270
Militant fire seems to
be coming from this area.

54
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,290
Wright stops running and shoots.

55
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,070
A short time later, two armed
militants appear on screen.

56
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,650
Johnson appears
to be unconscious.

57
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,280
Still, he is shot by the
militants at close range.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,670
Staff Sergeant Wright
dies just feet away.

59
00:03:01,670 --> 00:00:00,000
For them, the ambush is over.
