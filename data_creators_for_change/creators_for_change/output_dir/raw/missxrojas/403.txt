1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,180
four hours last night very very very

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,429
nervous but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go do today's</font>

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,000
challenge which is to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sunset and</font>

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,650
sunrise and the sunset I checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,590
sunset today is during my exam so the

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,420
sunrise is going to have to do but I

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,730
will take you somewhere very special to

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,000
do that

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,849
so i'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside the cathedral and</font>

11
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:30,250
google tells me the 813 is the official

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,010
time of the sunrise and that's kind of

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,390
what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just really</font>

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,010
nice I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forget when your</font>

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,540
university or surrounded by students all

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,400
the time I think there's a tendency<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,199
forget that there are other people in

18
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,570
the world to those kids in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> city or</font>

19
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,570
like game school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their dads and</font>

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,300
moms going to like work and self just a

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,920
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> life there's like a lot of</font>

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,589
deliveries and yeah but I am very very

23
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,230
nervous very nervous about later today

24
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,979
and I'm so happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fart lost ours is</font>

25
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,110
finally out<font color="#E5E5E5"> important of stars is a book</font>

26
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,500
by my friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Green when I was 14 I</font>

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">fellows but one of the falasca and i</font>

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,189
found it a very important time and it's

29
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,570
just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful book i still think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

30
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,760
a really beautiful book but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fault in</font>

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,140
our stars has in every way surpassed it

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,340
and being interrupted but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,250
cathedrals a bit older than me

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,270
I read The Fault in Our Stars a few

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,770
months ago now I actually read it and

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,110
this summer actually I read it the night

37
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,060
my dad died but its release date today

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,479
and it's strange having had that kind of

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,610
distance between reading book and the

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,170
experience think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff and</font>

41
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,380
then now I'm seeing other people have

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very first experience it's very odd</font>

43
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,550
really it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite odd because</font>

44
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,220
it's been I guess in my my circle of

45
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,690
thought like there's particularly may

46
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,460
think about a lot accomplished than

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,550
actually particular passages in my head

48
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,680
that just kind of tattoos they know why

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,000
only right at the once and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like don't</font>

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,959
have a copy yet my copy search can

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,550
arrive in February apparently I didn't

52
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,720
know I hope it's a bit quicker than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's yeah just certain bits</font>

54
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,660
with this that struck me so much that

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,959
it's great to see people begin to have

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,300
their experience with a book don't know

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,180
what do you want to say no just weekly

58
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,440
emotional about it I thinks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,450
this I'm quite nervous<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this exam</font>

60
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,390
but yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really rare that i give</font>

61
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,160
myself just time to sit and think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,470
not really one for kind of being still

63
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,440
or anything i think the concept just

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,730
confuses me like why be still when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,500
can be busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for someone</font>

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,230
who who likes and appreciates a lot of

67
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,400
them I guess meditative mindsets<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">even silly things like Pilates I I still</font>

69
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,650
occasionally find myself like great

70
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,320
being stills is fine but let's move

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,299
let's be noisy and loud<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

72
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,750
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in break those silences but</font>

73
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,519
today was really nice and like I

74
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,040
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking of the burnt red</font>

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sun of Gallifrey or something it was</font>

76
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,120
something out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a film it was something</font>

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,590
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a home beside but it wasn't</font>

78
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,810
something I expected to see and yet

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,269
happens every day I guess in a slightly

80
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,299
different way but every day all the same

81
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,070
home<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exam a little while ago and I</font>

82
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,350

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do a university exam ever</font>

86
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,630
crazy and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high for a</font>

87
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,810
long time and

88
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">I crashed and now just crashed suddenly</font>

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,190
all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge deprivation annoyances at</font>

90
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,510
myself because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just realized i got</font>

like five different quotations wrong and

92
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,530
all of that like that has all just hit

93
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,060
me it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to start the day</font>
