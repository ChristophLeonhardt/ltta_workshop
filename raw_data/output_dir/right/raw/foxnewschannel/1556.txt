1
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:11,706
MEETING.
IT ALL GOES TOGETHER WITH TRADE

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,707
AND CHINA.

3
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:16,311
>> Neil: BEN, IS HERE WITH US.

4
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:17,579
WHAT HAPPENED?

5
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,647
>> I'M HERE.

6
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:20,949
>> Neil: LET ME GET YOUR READ

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,249
THEM.

8
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:22,584
WHERE ARE WE GOING HERE?

9
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:26,121
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

10
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:27,422
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP STRUCK THE

11
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:27,956
RIGHT TONE.

12
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:28,990
HE'S NOT JUST SPEAKING TO THE

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,159
AMERICAN PEOPLE OR THE

14
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:31,926
JOURNALISTS, HE WAS SPEAKING TO

15
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:36,297
KIM JONG-UN AND HE WAS SPEAKING

16
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:37,265
TO THE CHINESE.

17
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:40,435
THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTAND THE

18
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,270
CARDS, WHETHER THE SUMMIT GOES

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,138
THROUGH OR NOT.

20
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:44,405
KIM JONG-UN IS TRYING TO SEIZE

21
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:45,673
THE P.R. NARRATIVE.

22
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:47,542
THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING PLACE NOW.

23
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,477
>> Neil: YOU THINK SOMETHING

24
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:50,745
HAPPENED WITH THE CHINESE

25
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,080
PRESIDENT TO CHANGE THE STRATEGY

26
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,380
HERE?

27
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,682
>> THE CHINESE ARE ALWAYS

28
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:55,783
PLAYING GAMES.

29
00:00:55,783 --> 00:01:00,021
LAST FRIDAY THEY LANDED A LONG

30
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:04,726
RANGE STRATEGIC BOMBER IN SOUTH

31
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:07,362
CHINA SEA.

32
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:09,664
>> Neil: AND LAUNCHED A ROCKED

33
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:10,965
ROCKET TO THE MOON.

34
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:14,469
>> AND THEY'RE OUTSPENDING US IN

35
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:17,005
QUANTUM COMPUTING.

36
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,041
THIS IS DANGEROUS STUFF.

37
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,643
I LIKE THE SECRETARY STATE.

38
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:23,511
ONE THING THAT HAS NOT BEEN

39
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:25,246
WIDELY REPORTED, AS SOON AS HE

40
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,916
GOT IN THERE, HE PUT A MECHANISM

41
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,051
IN PLACE TO OPEN UP THE BACK

42
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:31,152
CHANNEL DIALOGUE WITH NORTH

43
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:32,487
KOREA, THIS IS A SOLID SECRETARY

44
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:33,755
OF STATE AND IS PACED TO BE ONE

45
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,591
OF THE GREATEST SECRETARY OF

46
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:37,425
STATES OF ALL TIME.

47
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:38,626
>> Neil: WHATEVER YOU MAKE OF

48
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,628
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, IF THE

49
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:42,163
MEETING DOESN'T HAPPEN ON THE 12

50
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:42,497
MEETING DOESN'T HAPPEN ON THE  2

51
00:01:42,497 --> 00:01:46,601
12th FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEN

52
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:46,901
WHAT?

53
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,770
>> THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT

54
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,437
SAID TO CONDITIONAL.

55
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:50,939
I'M GOING TO GUARANTEE YOUR

56
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:51,272
SAFETY.

57
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:54,042
YOU CAN BE A RICH COUNTRY.

58
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,310
WE HAVE NOT LOST AN

59
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,345
INFORMATIONAL WAR CAMPAIGN WITH

60
00:01:57,345 --> 00:01:58,947
THE LIKES THAT KIM JONG-UN CAN

61
00:01:58,947 --> 00:01:59,581
NEVER SEEN.

62
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,617
WE CAN TURN OUR ARMY

63
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:05,987
PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS LOOSE.

64
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:06,721
THIS ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS,

65
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:10,991
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, KIM

66
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:14,028
JONG-UN HAD TO HIRE KGB AGENTS

67
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,196
TO TRAIN BODY GUARDS.

68
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:16,998
HE'S SPEAKING TO THE HOME TEAM.

69
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,333
HE'S HAD PROBLEMS ON THE HOME

70
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:18,967
FRONT.

71
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:20,568
>> SO THE PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU

72
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:22,670
JUST DESCRIBE IT AS LOW BALLING

73
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,973
EXPECTATIONS?

74
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:26,674
MAYBE THINGS GOT AHEAD OF ITSELF

75
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:28,309
AND WE WERE GOING

76
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,977
OVEROPTIMISTIC?

77
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:30,745
>> I THINK HE'S KEEPING THEM

78
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:31,112
GUESSING.

79
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,313
IT'S GOING FORWARD.

80
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:33,848
REAL PROBLEM HAS BEEN MADE.

81
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,049
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

82
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,684
IT'S AMERICAN STRENGTH THAT HAS

83
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:38,920
GOTTEN HIM TO THE TABLE AT THIS

84
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,220
POINT.

85
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,823
WHAT WE DO OR DON'T DO IS GOING

86
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:42,590
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS

87
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,792
PRESIDENT CAN CLOSE WHAT I CALL

88
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,161
THE BIGGEST DEAL OF ALL TIME.

89
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,297
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SINGAPORE.

90
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:50,832
WHEN WE SAY THAT KIM JONG-UN,

91
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:53,735
YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE TO BE A RICH

92
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:57,338
COUNTRY, WE SAY YOU CAN BE

93
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:57,705
SINGAPORE.

94
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:00,408
IT'S A SHINING CAPABLE OF WHAT

95
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:01,776
CAPITOLISM CAN DO.

96
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:02,710
AMERICAN VESTMENT IS FLOWING

97
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,111
THERE NOW.

98
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,412
DUKE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HAS A

99
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:05,280
BRANCH CAMPUS.

100
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,348
LET'S PLAY THAT UP AND SEIZE

101
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:09,217
THAT P.R. INITIATIVE.

102
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:11,552
>> Neil: OBVIOUSLY THIS LEADER

103
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:14,088
DOESN'T WANT TO END UP LIKE

104
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,290
MOAMMAR QADDAFI.

105
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,557
WE'VE MADE ASSURANCES THAT

106
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:18,693
YOU'LL BE FINE, YOUR COUNTRY

107
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:20,528
WILL BE FINE.

108
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:21,863
HOW MUCH IS BEING DRIVEN BY KIM

109
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,698
JONG-UN AND WORRIED ABOUT

110
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:24,632
WHETHER WE MEAN THAT?

111
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:25,466
>> IT'S REAL.

112
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,569
THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO HIRE TEN

113
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,571
EX-KGB AGENTS TO TRAIN BODY

114
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:30,905
GUARDS.

115
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,206
>> Neil: ON ANY LEVEL, IF HE

116
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:35,209
PLAYS HIS CARDS RIGHT, HE WILL

117
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,745
STAY IN POWER, HE'S A KNOWN

118
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,247
MURDER AND BUTCHER BUT THE ONLY

119
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,082
LEADER THEY GOT AND HE WILL

120
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:41,849
CONTINUE TO LEAD.

121
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,253
>> IF HE REALLY DENUCLEARIZES.

122
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:47,021
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

123
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,356
>> Neil: DENUCLEARIZE MEANS WHAT

124
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:48,756
TO YOU?

125
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,191
>> GETTING RID OF THAT

126
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:52,894
CAPABILITY TO WHERE THEY COULD

127
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:56,130
HAVE A NUCLEAR DEVICE WITH THE

128
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,765
SUFFICIENT RANGE WITH BALLISTIC

129
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:58,966
CAPABILITY TO HIT THE UNITED

130
00:03:58,966 --> 00:03:59,300
STATES.

131
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,469
ALSO LET'S SAY THAT THEY DO --

132
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,072
>> Neil: DO THEY HAVE A

133
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:06,174
DIFFERENT DEFINITION?

134
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,409
>> BIG TIME.

135
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,714
EXPERTS THINK THERE'S 10,000

136
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:13,448
NUCLEAR EXPERTS AND TECHNICIANS

137
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:13,915
IN NORTH KOREA.

138
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:14,649
EVEN IF YOU DO DENUCLEARIZE,

139
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:15,783
THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY.

140
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:17,250
ONLY AN OLD RONALD REAGAN MAN.

141
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,120
TRUST BUT VERIFY.

142
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,156
IT'S GOING TO BE A PHASED

143
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:22,523
APPROACH.

144
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:25,693
>> Neil: LET ME ASK YOU, YOU

145
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:26,861
MENTIONED RONALD REAGAN.

146
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,096
HE WAS WILLING TO WALK AWAY FROM

147
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:29,897
THE TALKS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

148
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:30,198
TALKS.

149
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:34,102
HE CAME BACK AND GOT WHAT HE

150
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:34,602
WANTED.

151
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:35,670
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

152
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,105
SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP DO

153
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:37,505
SOMETHING.

154
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:38,005
>> CERTAINLY CAN.

155
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,974
HE CONVEYED THAT MESSAGE TODAY.

156
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:41,809
IF IT DOES HAPPEN, IT DOES.

157
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,512
THIS PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS ONE

158
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:44,946
THING.

159
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:46,214
HIS MOST IMPORTANT

160
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:47,315
RESPONSIBILITY IS PRESIDENT OF

161
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:49,317
THE UNITED STATES IS AS

162
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,452
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.

163
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:52,153
KEEPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

164
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:52,453
SAFE.

165
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:53,721
THAT'S HIS FIRST AROUND FOREMOST

166
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:54,288
RESPONSIBLE TIP.

167
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:55,423
HE GETS IT.

168
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,958
>> Neil: WHEN YOU'RE AT A AN

169
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:01,129
ARMY NAVY GAME, WHO DO YOU ROOT

170
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:01,396
FOR?

171
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:03,798
>> I'M AN ARMY GUY.

172
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:06,033
MANY YEARS AGO, I WAS TRAINING

173
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:06,701
FOR DRILL SERGEANT.

174
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,636
>> Neil: I CAN BELIEVE THAT MY

175
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:08,970
MISTAKE.

176
00:05:08,970 --> 00:00:00,000
THANKS FOR SEEING YOU.
