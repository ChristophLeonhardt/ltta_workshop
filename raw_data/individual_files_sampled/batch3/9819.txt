WOULD HAVE REMAINED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. Tucker: BESIDES CHRISTINE FORD AND KAVANAUGH HIMSELF, THE CHIEF FIGURE IN THE HEARING TODAY WAS THE ARIZONA PROSECUTOR RACHEL MITCHELL. DID SHE ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS OR MISS ANYTHING IMPORTANT? POSSIBLY RHETORICAL QUESTION. WE HAVE THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR NATIONAL CHILDHOOD INTRADICTION AND SHE JOINS US TONIGHT. I WATCHED THE HEARINGS AND I KEPT THINKING HOW ALONE BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS. I AM NOT ATTACKING THE PROSECUTOR WHO ASKED IN THE FIRST HALF BUT KAVANAUGH SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY ONE MAKING A CASE FOR KAVANAUGH. YOU KNOW, TUCKER, UNFORTUNATELY I AGREE WITH YOU. ALTHOUGH THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS THAT KAVANAUGH WAS THE ONLY PERSON EVERYONE TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE ALLEGATIONS, WHICH I THINK IS THE ROLE OF MISS MITCHELL. SHE DID A COUPLE THINGS WELL, ESTABLISHING POSSIBLE POLITICAL BIAS IN THE SENSE OF THE DELAY OF THE HEARING. THIS RIDICULOUS ALLEGATION THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO FLY. SHE CERTAINLY BLEW THAT OUT OF THE WATER. AND THE ELUCIDATION OF THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT DR. FORD DELAYED IN HER OWN WORD COMING FORWARD WITH THE INFORMATION. SHE SAID THAT SHE KNEW ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH'S POSITION ON THE SHORT LIST AND THAT SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PREVENT HIS NOMINATION. YET, SOMEHOW THIS Ph.D. WAS UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CALL EITHER OF HER TWO SENATORS. BOTH OF WHOM SIT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. MISS MITCHELL DID A GOOD JOB WITH THAT BUT WHEN IT CAME TO ASKING ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS I WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE TOLD DR. FORD SHE WOULD NOT BE ASKING HER ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS AT ALL. AND SHE DIDN'T. Tucker: RIGHT. LIKE BUYING A NEW CAR AND NOT MENTIONING A PRICE. ON THE PLANE THING, SHE ESTABLISHED THAT CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD HAS FLOWN AN AWFUL LOT. SHE COULD HAVE TEASED OUT IS WHY SHE LIED ABOUT IT IN THIS CASE. WE CAN'T COME TO WASHINGTON TO TESTIFY BECAUSE SHE CAN'T GET ON AN AIRPLANE. THIS HAD A POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. DELAYING THE CONFIRMATION OF KAVANAUGH. THAT IS LIE. WHY IS NOBODY SAYING THAT? I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID A BRILLIANT JOB EXPLAINING WHAT THE DELAY MEANT TO HIM, HIS FAMILY AND HIS REPUTATION AND THEIR FUTURE. PROSECUTORS LIKE TO SAY DON'T ASK A QUESTION YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO. SO DON'T ASK A WHY QUESTION? ALL TRAINED PROSECUTORS KNOW THAT IS GARBAGE. YOU HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO. IN EVERY TRIAL YOU OFTEN DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. SHE SHOULD HAVE CHALLENGED DR. FORD AND SHE DID NOT. Tucker: I NOTICED.
