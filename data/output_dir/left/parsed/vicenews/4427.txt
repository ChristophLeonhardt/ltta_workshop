— In Malaysia today,
the two women accused of killing the estranged
half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
appeared in court, wearing bulletproof vests.
The two were seen on security cameras
at the Kuala Lumpur airport last February,
attacking Kim Jong-nam with a cloth to the face.
Authorities say it was covered with VX nerve agent—
a compound that the UN considers
a weapon of mass destruction.
The two women say they thought
the attack was a prank—
but if convicted of the murder,
they could face the death penalty.
Nothing about the bizarre case
seems to make much sense.
And in rural Indonesia,
the family of one of the two
accused attackers is still struggling
to come to grips with
what’s happened to their daughter.
— Siti’s parents say she moved to
Malaysia to work as a shopkeeper,
to earn money to send back home.
— Siti claims she was manipulated
into taking part in the murder.
She says she was offered $100
to participate in a TV prank video.
