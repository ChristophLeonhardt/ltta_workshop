fireballs at same old greyscale trying
to keep me inside feeling so small stuck
in the details keep me far leaning like
I got a fire in this heart of mine can't
put it up so don't even try for
something more
oh I can't have this feeling let it take
over now
it's my time don't need no reason to get
up and get out I gotta fire this heart
of mine for something more
letting do
No
I meant for something beautiful
I gotta you miss heart of mine
can't put it hurts don't even try Oh
you
