British MP has tweeted god save us in response to reports at the UK army will fly in food medicines and fuel should the country come crashing out of the EU without a trade deal while the military has since said it's not received any such instructions the news has created a sense of panic among some well let's get the latest now from London and then see choke and he's covering the story for us Nastia so what of course it's up raw been well Andrew with the brexit deadline looming uncertainty about what exactly is going to be achieved calm March next year seems to be peaking especially in light of these latest reports circulating in the British press suggesting that the British Army is on standby to be able to deliver crucial goods and supplies in case of a new deal brexit goods such as food and fuel medicine etc and of course it's safe to assume that measures like this would usually be taken in case of emergencies and of course reactions from MPs here in London have been very Swift with some being shocked and others refusing to be manipulated into what they call scare tactics god help us this is not coming from remain errs this is not project fear Pro brexit ministers are drawing up blueprints for the army to deliver food fuel and medicine if we leave the EU with no deal we have a duty to prevent this self-immolation the plan of scaring the crap out of people with No Deal horror stories in order to make an FTA which will tank the economy look like a good deal he's beginning to work how you look at this potential doomsday preparations or reasonable preparations analysts here some analysts here have been quick to point out that this certainly looks far from the promises being made to the British public about taking back control so to try to calm some of this down far from being worried about preparations that were making I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the government is saying we're in a negotiation we're working for a good deal I believe we can get a good deal but actually it's right that we say because we don't know what the what the outcome is going to be we think it's going to be a good one we're working for a good one but let's prepare for every eventualities but at the same time we know that Downing Street have said that they are no longer going to be drip-feeding information of details of contingency plans in case of an Odile brexit and all of this said we have to keep in mind that just a latest spy data poll has revealed that as many as 78 percent of those surveyed believe that the British government is not doing a good job on breakfast where there's only 10 percent think it's being a job well done you
