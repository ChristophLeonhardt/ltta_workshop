WOMEN AT A WOMEN'S ONLY
SCREENING OF WONDER WOMEN IN
BELGIUM WERE GIVEN GIFT BASKETS
OF CLEANING SUPPLIES, DIET PILL
PAMPHLETS AND CHOCOLATE IN A
MOVE THAT EITHER COMPLETELY
MISSED THE POINT OF A FEMALE
LEAD SUPERHERO MOVIE,
OR IS WAS JUST PLAINLY SEXIST.
ATTENDEES AT A WOMAN ONLY JUNE 6
SCREENING AT THE FILL AND A
BELGIUM THEATER REPORTEDLY
RECEIVED BAGS.
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE INCREDIBLE
GIFT BASKETS AT THAT
SOME OF THAT STUFF IS FINE.
THE NOT SHOWS.
WHO DOESN'T WANT NOT JUST?
VALID POINT THAT THE SQUEEGEE
IS USEFUL.
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN INNER
CAR.
A WOMAN'S MAGAZINE, DIET
PILL -
QUINOA.
ITíS HEALTHY.
THE THEATER IS MAINTAINING
THAT THE ITEMS WERE JUST
PRODUCTS FROM THE THEATER
SPONSORS AND THAT THEY
CERTAINLY WERENíT INTENDED TO CAUSE
OFFENSE.
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE
INTENDED TO DO SO, THEY
SHOULD'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
1ST OF ALL, I DON'T EVEN CARE
THAT THE MOVIE WAS WONDER WOMAN.
AMAZING.
AGREED.
I DONíT EVEN CARE THAT THE MOVIE
WAS WONDER WOMAN.
I THINK IF YOU ARE GIVING GIFT
BASKETS TO WOMEN AND YOU
ARE INCLUDING CLEANING SUPPLIES
AND DIET PILL PAMPHLETS AND
CHOCOLATE, YOU CAN REALLY GO F
YOURSELF.
I THINK THE LARGER PROBLEM
HERE IS WHY IS ONE OF ONE
OF YOUR SPONSORS AT DIET PILL
MANUFACTURER?
THINK THEN IS SPONSORING IT.
THINK THEN IS THE PROTEIN
BAR, RIGHT?
THEY MAKE PROTEIN BARS.
IS NOT SPECIFICALLY
I'M FINE WITH PROTEIN BARS
BUT DIET PILLS?
DIET PILL PAMPHLETS, NOT
OKAY.
AND THEN HAVING THESE PEOPLE ñ
PICTURES OF WOMEN ON THE
FRONT LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY THE
MAGAZINE AND ALL OF THAT
TOTALLY GOES AGAINST WHAT WONDER
WOMAN STANDS FOR.
JOHN AND I WERE TALKING ON
THINK TANK ABOUT HOW DIRECTOR
PATTY JENKINS PURPOSEFULLY
SHOWED THE WOMEN'S WRINKLES
AND SHOWED HOW GOOD DOES THE IG
GOING SO WE COULD MOVE AWAY
FROM THE MILL CASE AND MILL
EXPECTATIONS OF WOMEN AND THEN
THEY GIVE THIS GIFT BASKET THAT
COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT THAT
I'VE GOTTEN A FEW GIFT BAGS
AND MOVIE PREMIERES AND
JUST MOVIES THEY DIDN'T
INCLUDE CLEANING SUPPLIES AND
CHOCOLATE THAT USUALLY IT IS
PROMOTIONAL THING, SUGAR A
STICKER IN COUPON FOR POPCORN.
THIS IS A RIDICULOUS BAG AND TO
SAY WE DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT
WAY, IT IS NOT EASY TO BUY.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE A
GIFT BAG AT A MOVIE
SCREENING, GIVE A GIFT BAG OF
POPCORN.
EVERYBODY WANTS THAT.
YEAH, I DON'T EVEN CARE THAT
IT WAS WONDER WOMAN THAT
I CARE THAT IT WAS WONDER
WOMAN BECAUSE THE POINT OF
THIS MOVIE LIKE YOU MENTIONED IS
NOT THE FOCUS ON
TRADITIONAL GENDER NORMS.
WONDER WOMAN IS SPECIAL BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
THOSE THINGS.
SHE IS ABLE TO BE WONDERFUL AND
POSITIVE AND STRONG AND
EMPOWERED AND IT JUST KIND OF
FLIES IN THE FACE OF THAT TALK
MY POINT IS 100% AGREE WITH
YOU, BUT MY POINT IS EVEN IF IT
WERE BATMAN OR SAUSAGE PARTY OR
WHATEVER MOVIE IT WAS
EZRA MOVIE JOHN.
I KNOW THE
IF THEY HAD GIFT BASKETS THAT
WERE MEANT WOMEN, CLEANING
SUPPLIES, CHOCOLATE AND DIET
PILL PAMPHLETS I WOULD
STILL BE PISTON THINK IT WAS
STEREOTYPICAL AND SEXIST OUT
AND THE CHOCOLATES ARE FINE
DIETS VIDEO GOING INTO A MOVIE.
THEIR PMS STEREOTYPES AT THE
THAT'S A COMPONENT BUT I LIKE
CHOCOLATE I WOULD'VE TAKEN
A TAG OF CHOCOLATE I DON'T WANT
DIET PILLS THAT
IS A DIFFERENT CONTEXT.
YEAH, YEAH THAT BUT IF A
MOVIE THEATER HAS A SPONSOR
THAT IS A CHOCOLATE
MANUFACTURER, THAT
NATURALLY MAKES MORE SENSE THAN
WITH GOD DIET PILL THAT
IF IT WAS JUST CHOCOLATE
AND POPCORN AND NOT JUST,
DELEGATE THE NODULES, I WOULD BE
LIKE TOTALLY COOL.
I WISH I HAD THAT IN MY WONDER
WOMAN MOVIE SCREENING.
I'LL TAKE A SQUEEGEE TO DUCK
KNOW WHEN YOU ADD IN
EVERYTHING ELSE AND THINGS
ARE PUT INTO CONTEXT AND YOU CAN
LOOK INTO THE IMPLICATIONS
THEIR LITTLE BIT MORE.
