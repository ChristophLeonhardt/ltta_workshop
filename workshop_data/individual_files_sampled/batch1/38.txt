it's been a difficult few years for Argentinian football but when the team left the country to head to Russia the fans were willing to leave it all behind I hope Missy gives the best of himself for the national team and I hope that he can pick up the cup which is his dream in the dream of all Argentines since making it to the final in 2014 there's been financial difficulties accusations of political corruption and mismanagement that saw star player Yarnell Messi quit the team at one point it appeared as though they may struggle to make it to Russia the Argentine team is the only one having qualified to this World Cup that had three trainers in the qualifiers we had hello Mario Bauza Jorge sampaoli nothing can be well organized when you have three different trainers and the last month's the situation hasn't gotten any better if we didn't have Messi it would be a real mess for the national team but we have the captain with a genius and so anything can happen even though we don't have a team we don't have a concrete plan ahead of the matches we know how are we are going to play so there are many many questions surrounding the team the latest scandal was when the national team suspended a warmer match with Israel prior to the cup many accused Israel of moving the match from Haifa to Jerusalem to reaffirm its claim over the city as Israel's capital the Argentine Football Association said it was due to security concerns things have not been easy for Argentina in recent years despite having what many consider the best player in the world in Leonel Messi but regardless of the difficulties problems and candles we have seen it takes seven matches to win the World Cup and people here are hoping that this time luck will be an Argentine siren Jorge lucha was one of the winners in 1986 he says that times have changed since then the problem for the coach and for the team these days is that there's almost no time to be together to practice and that's bad for the tamer the players are in different countries it was different in my time it's been over 30 years since argentina won the cup and even though they're not among the favorites who is the one thing people are not ready to lose yet there is a wall al-jazeera Buenos Aires
