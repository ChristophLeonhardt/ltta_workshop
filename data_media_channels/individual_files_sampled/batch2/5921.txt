they want to start with you first of all because the president that called your name in Pennsylvania he said he liked you but then well yeah let's hear it again I mean it was it was entertaining the first time I have a feeling with Donald Trump it'll be entertaining the second time so I'm reading Peggy Noonan and she's a nice woman I like her she doesn't like me much but and she's writing like I'm some kind of a Neanderthal and I'm saying you know I'm really smart I love what he talks about how smart he is and what schools he went to so Peggy first of all will will respond to that and then I want to ask you something about the Pennsylvania candidate Donald Trump is no Neanderthal but but but where are we right now with this man who is rushing into meetings and saying I want to meet with a North Korean leader and undoubtedly putting pressure on Republicans to come to a speedy and incorrect conclusion all at the same time there's a personal aspect of this stormy Daniels issue an upcoming sixty minutes interview and a lot of questions raised about the legal status of these payoffs well my first thought when I saw the clip again was that President Trump did go into what was kind of a very comic and funny riff after the section we showed in which he spoofed the idea of being presidential he said anyone can be presidential then he stiffened up and he acted like a robot and the crowd loved that it was a very comical moment I actually think he misunderstands something he says it would be so easy to be presidential I actually think he struggles with it it's not something he does because it's not something that is natural to him or that he knows how to do and it hurts him that he can't be quote presidential what is that a more measured person a person who rattles the electorate less a person who is perhaps less dramatic less helter-skelter may be more reliable when he tells you how he feels about guns he sticks with that point of view do you know it means someone who who you think is is a more reliable person I think that would put many people at greater ease with him and I think it's not something that that he has shown in the past what are we 1415 months in that he can do well and it is something that several of our baby-boomer presidents have had a hard time doing and in fact Peggy it's often much harder to turn the other cheek it's often much harder to ignore insults from people all around you it's much harder to show the sort of restraint that you're talking about yes session being able to keep yourself in and not be rattled by all the external stuff and not always having to be responsive to it and if you're mad at the press as he frequently is don't make it clear you're dying for the presses approval you know someone Tom Shales in the Washington Post once said many years ago when Ronald Reagan's presidency was new Tom Shales said Reagan treats the press like they are wild ducks attempting to attack his ankles he just he shoes the boy he flips them away that's a more effective way for a for a national candidate for a national figure to act but but mr. Trump always makes it clear that they get to him you know people close to Ronald Reagan who worked with Ronald Reagan people like you people like Pat Buchanan said Pat Buchanan said that said Ronald Reagan never ever was was concerned about a headline in the newspapers now if some of the conservative magazines like human events criticized him he would you know he would be concerned about that but yeah he didn't stay up and I am worrying about what the press was saying about him and one of my favorite stories had do with his biographer who went up to visit him one day and thought he was going to have a terrible interview because the top of the LA Times this was the year after he retired had one negative story after another negative story about Reagan and he said oh my god he's going to be in no position to see me he goes into Reagan's home goes to the back porch and there's Ronald Reagan looking at the LA Times and his face is red and at that point he said oh my god he's read the paper I might as well just go home he's going to give me nothing Reagan folds the paper throws it at him has said have you seen this story in the LA Times he's like yes yes mr. president I have and that Reagan goes I can't believe the O'Malleys are going to sell the Dodgers to Murdoch and he said at that moment he got the genius of Ronald Reagan Peggy and that is he just didn't let things get to him like other politicians did yeah that's why he was able to stay the course for so long on what he believed well you know Ronald Reagan was was modern conservatism he was conservatism when it had just come together and it's in its modern incarnation and it was not fully perhaps understood but Ronald Reagan did not expect to be understood himself he didn't hope for that he had a philosophy he had stands he went forward feeling that he was right and what he represented was right but he didn't make that mistake people can make which is to ask to be understood do you not I mean people will understand you and time but don't ask for that don't don't don't insist they give you things be who you are go forward stand where you stand in the end it'll probably turn out okay thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
