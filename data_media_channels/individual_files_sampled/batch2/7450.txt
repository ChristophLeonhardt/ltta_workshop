now in this laptop I possess fabulous information we're up to 87% reporting and it's been called yes okay to review for everyone as we do this coverage live on election nights as we always do Adrian Gilliam deeply progressive backed by almost all the progressive groups our revolution and on down John gets the whole list in a second Gwen Graham backed by the establishment almost everyone in the Democratic establishment backing Gwen Graham Andrew Gilliam young african-american already in state politics already had a great list of accomplishments I interviewed him on rebel headquarters he's checked out an interview out on youtube.com slash rebel HQ and he is dynamic and he ran a super strong race and when I see great candidates like that I think like do I know anything about politics cuz if I do I feel like he's got a good chance of winning even though of course the establishment candidate has way more money endorsements the Machine has all that now of course sometimes it doesn't happen tonight Pam Keith she's a wonderful just Democrat super dynamic as well as I was she had a great chance just to base on the kind of campaign she was running it didn't happen for her and and and look there's the Brent welders and the Greg Edwards that that that lose even though they run a great great campaign but Andrew Gilliam at all the progressives in the country were excited by him and and it turns out we were right we were right to be excited so one of the biggest wins I would say of the whole primary season I would you know there's you I'm gonna do what I below and everyone else doing but I'm gonna say the disclaimer part first okay I love a disclaimer look you got 33 percent of the vote 34 percent of the vote with you know Philip Levine got twenty the others got fourteen point four percent so there so those who want to mitigate his impact will use those numbers and they won't be wrong we don't know what would happen if Philip Levine hadn't run but it's a primary and frequently there are many people involved in the primary I often find that to be a super uninteresting point because you get the races you have not the ones you wish so yeah he won the race he had you got a win and right so is Rahm soul who say right so sometimes there is a spoiler candidate that takes just enough votes and then that conversation becomes a little bit more interesting but in a 3-way race okay yeah you got and we don't have any way of knowing that if it just been a two-way race maybe he would have beat her by six seven points we have no idea but either way enormous Lea relic right but all I mean is in the if you're looking for what I'm now gonna say like a sign of changes in the Democratic Party it's hard to say it's a sign because he only has 33 or 34 percent of the vote that said like Glen Graham the thing that I am embarrassed that I didn't know that she's Bob Graham's daughter I mean so this is the establishment candidate the daughter of a popular former governor and Senator and presidential candidate and a very establishment Democrat and and and in some of the good ways for Bob Graham like he was you know she met him he's a reasonable smart guy and look they just beat his daughter right like I mean and and Hillary Clinton lost twice like you know that sort of idea that this sort of the the prince the princes and princesses of the establishment of named powered leaders in the Democratic Party has taken it on the chin yeah so yes and it's that of course that all by itself is is comforting to say hopefully that will also have an induction hunter junior in the fifth I really sail born yeah yeah yeah so I really dislike the idea of royalty in this country so so if anything ever bias against family members running like really two people in the same family both happen to be like the perfect person for those particular races in a country of 330 million people or there are perhaps the name recognition is helping them and hence the we had a revolution in this country so is not to have royalty and to establish a deep state those two and I think that and and this was this again there's there's value in eliminating part one yeah and and and look it matters to the American dream Andrew Gilliam grew up with not a lot of money in in in Miami and he worked so hard got himself a new into a good school and and worked his way up and that's the American Dream and the fact that it's alive is not a small thing and and even though a lot of people on the left are worried that it's not alive and I'm an optimistic person and you see somebody like Andrew who absolutely positively it did ironically what the Republicans you know talk about pulling himself up by the bootstraps as they will run against the viciously pretty soon right it's just great to see and it's not just against the world here's Sarah to me the most important lesson out of this race to Alexandria cos you're Cortes race car Eastman race and the list goes on all the 24 just Democrats have won so far Gilliam wasn't he was backed by old other groups that's real unity I love it I don't care that he is or is not any particular label he's a fantastic progressive that's what I care about but to me the even the bigger lesson is the machine is not as invincible as they would have you believe yeah that's right yeah that's right they're not and they told you hey don't even bother running don't don't bother you're not it's the guy's not taking corporate back money you're never gonna win right look the Machine scared people into not running you know scared established some people into not running against Hillary Clinton I mean Joe by I don't need to read one story I mean I know Joe Biden had personal it's just we're not running and those were very real issues but but Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren and every other democratic decided not to run they didn't run cuz they were like I'm gonna get disrupt I mean I'm gonna get crushed with money I'm gonna get crushed with ads my spirit is gonna get crushed and we should not ignore that part right and people were my friends are gonna turn on me and I and I'm going to lose right and Bernie Sanders has had a whole life where he was like I don't care that my friends certainly not in watch but I mean but also that means the recomment gonna turn on me and and incest we're being obstinate that's right it was incredibly helpful and one of the things that I think has held back some of the types of candidates that we have running and winning in primaries across the country now is that you don't necessarily have like-minded ideologically similar national figures to come in and help you out like people still early in these cycles were like oh I wonder who Obama's gonna endorse the hope of progressive but you know that he's probably not gonna do that but you did have Bernie Sanders and so he went around rallying for people like Brent welder and a number of other candidates you have Alexandra custo Cortez as well and after some of these other primaries and after November you're gonna have a lot more you might have been jealous you might have Andrew Gilliam these people who are gonna be commanding media attention are gonna be able to help out in future cycles similar sorts of candidates we can take that element of the Machine away and use it against them and if you're watching tonight and if you just heard what I said you are the if Andrew Gilliam does what he now must do I mean great when right when everybody now you got to go beat kooky Rhonda Santos in this well with his kids then you're the incredibly young pull up your bootstraps governor of Florida and get ready to know Andrew gillum's name for the rest of his life right yeah it'll be a governor he'll be a senator he may skip becoming a senator and go right from being governor to running for president of the United States and but you got to beat you got to beat Rhonda Sanders first and then most importantly though what you got to do if he is able to win in November when he gets in gets to Tallahassee then whether it's January or December whenever they bring in the new governor I have to govern and you have to govern effectively and without corruption which is a problem it's in Florida and you know in his case uncorrupted doesn't take core PAC money and has already shown that he can govern there's no harder job in America the being mayor of a city and I think people criticize this very often obviously we come from a particular perspective we're progressives in particular races we might be biased like here we're talking about we like Andrew Gilliam we don't like right into Santis you know but I think in this particular race we be more fair we should help out Ron de santis his goal is to let everyone know that he loves Donald Trump is super tight with Donald Trump I think we should spend the next couple months helping him to spread that message what by the way it's a Broward there's now 500 now nearly all reported 12 precincts out in Broward and he he beat Gwen Graham he beat Levine by 18,000 votes he beat Quinn Graham by 34,000 votes in Broward County shy he is ahead by 38,000 look if you've been watching this live throughout the night been made a great point about how important Broward County was gonna be that's why I think we do a pretty decent job on these election nights give me the context that you need and it turns out that that was probably decisive in this race last couple of things here look now with the Gilliam victory not only do you have all the positive things that I mentioned before but you also have momentum how many primary nights in a row is there gonna be headlines all over the country yep another progressive wins and another progressive wins and this is a big one this for the governor's race in Florida he took on a huge establishment candidate he had no chance when he began or at least conventional wisdom said he had no chance and now people might start to like in famously in like in Chris's pride that word might not mean what you think it means so you keep telling us it's impossible but somehow we keep on winning so and I think that that momentum is gonna start to seep in even to the thick-headed mainstream media in Washington where like you know in the be like that's so funny I revolution it's not winning enough wait a minute they won again and then just Democrats won in the Nicasio Cortez won and and and and Ben Jealous won and now here comes Ben here comes a Gilliam and yes can I read some polls from Florida just before we just where we celebrate his a victory so on there was a poll July 23rd to 25th so a month ago mason-dixon poll that had Graham at 27 Levine at 18 green who we haven't even mentioned who clearly came in fourth at 12th and Gilliam at 10 now long ago was that one month and surhoff survey hold on survey u-s-a august 10th through the 13th two weeks ago pulled attended 15 days ago gram 22 Lavine 22 green 16 Gilliam 11 in fourth place Florida Atlantic pole 8 16 - 8 20 the pole ended eight days ago gram 29 Lavine 17 green 11 Gilliam 11 so he's tied for third but still at 11 points 18 points behind her finally a gravis marketing poll from a 21 to 825 a poll that entered three days ago Graham 26 Lavine 18 green 19 Gilliam 16 still in 4th place ten points behind all polls indicating and she had a 7 point 2 percent average of those polls and clearly everybody at the end of this race coming suggesting also perhaps that the visit there in the last three or four days from Bernie Sanders made a rather significant difference yeah I want a political write that article so but listen guys I want to say one other thing that's really really important about that what one of our thesis for progresses was we can get unlikely voters to show up so a lot of these polls poll likely voters so yes he was behind yes he ran an amazing campaign yes Bernie Sanders all other progressive groups made a big difference but also the the polling isn't accurate because they're pulling the wrong people I'm not one of those guys are pulling they don't trust them no you can they're just they're just using the wrong data set if you've got a real progressive in the race a populist in the race who's gonna bring in people that wouldn't normally otherwise vote and this is an excellent case but now the eat even more importantly that's why we think progressives have a better chance of winning general elections because they're gonna get those same people who don't normally vote to show up to vote so now because Andrew Gilliam won we get to test that theory in a massively important race like the Florida governor's race and and so if Adrian Gilliam beats the Santas it will shock Washington for the second time and it will make it much much harder for those guys who are so skeptical and and dismissive of progressives to say that that we can't win when we just won so tonight was a giant night and and apparently resistance is not futile so don't believe the hype here comes progressives all over the country
