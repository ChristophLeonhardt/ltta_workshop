and our breaking news report tonight about Rudy what Rudy Guiliani had to say about the Muller investigation Sean Hannity on Fox News tonight asked Rudy Giuliani the big question what would happen if the president is subpoenaed to testify if the president refuses to agree to an interview with the special prosecutor Robert Muller has told the president's lawyers that he might or could then subpoena the president because of that Sean Hannity asked that question tonight what if the president is subpoenaed and Rudy Giuliani gave this answer if they issue a subpoena that will be that will be unprecedented in the sense that it's pretty clear that a president can't be subpoenaed to a criminal proceeding about him now why is that and unfortunately or maybe unfortunately we have the real life circumstance going on that the founding fathers thought about which is a president cannot be distracted by a criminal investigation you can always prosecute them after they can get him when he leaves the White House you could always prosecute him after we I could not it if mo said to me tomorrow bring him in two hours it's like you want no questions that you don't want and we're pretty much ready to clear him I could not go to the president United States and say take two days off to get ready for that and screw the whole thing with North Korea I how could any American do that he's our president he is going to negotiate I believe a non-nuclear situation on the Korean evening thanks a lot nobody thought about it here right now you're gonna interfere with that Jill wine banks Rudy Giuliani clearly does not remember that President Nixon was conducting the Vietnam War every day of your investigation about President Nixon but to go go to Rudy Giuliani's line saying a president can't be subpoenaed to a criminal proceeding about him apparently Rudy doesn't remember the law either the Supreme Court said in very clear terms that the president had to comply with a subpoena now that was a subpoena for his documents not for testimony so in that regard it is undecided about testimony but there is no reason that a court would distinguish between the two and if Donald Trump has time to play as much golf as he plays and to have as much executive time as he has he has time to prepare for this this reminds me of Richard Nixon saying I am NOT a crook well we know how that ended and he's gonna have to find the time to defend himself he's going to have to find the time and the other thing that Rudy said is that you can always get him after he's out yes clearly you can indict the president after he's out of office but there is a statute of limitations that could run during that time and there is a right to a speedy trial and unless he waives those that won't work and Jonathan Chait we clearly see the strategy developing here Rudy Giuliani earlier in the day had said I thought something reasonable about this which was he would like to delay any interview with the special prosecutor until after the summit in involving North and South Korea which could be within the next month or so that sounded to me like a reasonable delay for a reasonable reason and the courts grant delays for lesser reasons all the time fine we-we've but tonight that's not what Rudy Giuliani was saying he was he was emotionalizing his response to how the president would respond to a subpoena by adding North Korea in there after saying after laying down the legal doctrine that can't be found anywhere outside of Rudy Giuliani's head at the moment that the founding fathers made sure that the president would not be distracted by a criminal investigation founding fathers never did that and we have in our recent history seen two president's distracted at very strongly not to mention the Reagan's special prosecutor this has become almost a standard of presidencies now right and let's be honest Donald Trump is the most distractible president we've ever had in the history of the United States it's been widely and repeatedly shown that he can't sit through intelligence briefings can't absorb written materials of longer than a few bullet points at once has no patience for any of the stuff and watches hours and hours of television which he reveals to the country daily through his Twitter feed by live tweeting Fox and Friends so he's more poorly positioned than anyone ever to hold this office to say he's too busy to sit down for legal proceeding he's obviously not and Joyce Vance Barack Obama uniquely among recent presidents is the only one who managed to run his entire presidency without a special prosecutor investigating anything in the Obama administration but the special prosecutor is investing presidential administrations and the presidents themselves have been a distraction to put it mildly that most recent presidents have had to put up with they have and Giuliani seems to have manufactured this legal doctrine that you can't bother a president out of thin air but what's clear Lawrence is that Muller came to this fight fully loaded for bear he probably saw the subpoena fight coming from the moment he was appointed brought over from the Solicitor General's Office at the Justice Department one of the most highly esteemed Supreme Court practitioners at the Justice Department someone who will capably litigate the subpoena issue someone who will be fully up to speed on the nuances of the issue and it seems clear that Muller who after all has provided to the president's lawyers the possibility that a subpoena would be forthcoming and made it clear that that's part of his possible arsenal of tools that he'll use he has obviously already made the decision that he can win that fight let's listen what Rudy Giuliani said when Sean Hannity asked him about the special counsels investigators possibly interviewing Ivanka Trump or Jared Kushner let's listen to this if they do do Ivanka which I doubt they will it's the whole country of turn-on they're going after his daughter thought about his son-in-law they talked about him I guess I read as a fine man you know that but men are you know disposable but a fine woman like Ivanka come on Jade Robinson the president's so-called lead lawyer is saying that his son-in-law president's son-in-law is disposable well you know the president at the end of all this will have a great issue for appeal the inadequate representation in themes each other this is the best he has I mean again so you have to just take this with the knowledge that Rudy Jeolla Giuliani in some parts of this interview it's just not making sense it's just totally off the wall that said I have said before and will say again now that any competent lawyer I think would not ever let President Trump sit down for that interview if they could possibly help it including throwing them so badly between him and and lower and as evidence look at that train wreck on Fox and Friends last week that we talked about then so if he does have an interview I think he just has to take the fifth he can't have it open at an interview he'll confess to three felonies before the first bathroom break three felonies that mullah didn't even know about Jill we need your reaction to what Giuliani just said about the country would turn on them if they dared question Ivanka Trump but Jared he's disposable that wasn't the part I responded to so much if I don't know if I was on camera but flames were coming out of me because what does he mean Ivanka has a White House position she's an adviser to the president and what is this business about she's a woman she can't be questioned she's an adviser the president and that is the most sexist thing I've heard in recent times I'm outraged but I don't think any of us were surprised to hear that sort of thing from original Yanni Jonathan shake Eugene Robinson Jill wine banks Jase pants thank you very much for joining us in our breaking news coverage of this tonight hey
