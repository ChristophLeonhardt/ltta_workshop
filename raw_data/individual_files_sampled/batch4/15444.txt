a humble request for those on the progressive left if you're going to compare someone to a Nazi or Adolf Hitler can you kindly pass along some tangible evidence to make your case so disgrace comedian Kathy Griffin appeared on an Australian talk show recently if anything Griffin proved that some people will never learn from their mistakes that's because she's gone from posing with a decapitated head meant to look like Donald Trump and antic that got her fired from CNN to now calling the president a Nazi check it out first of all the accidental president is what I call him because I was under two months federal investigation for taking a picture of a mask from my own country so I'm here doing a world tour but we have to make fun of him because he's so ridiculous and dangerous and I actually have known this fool for like more I'm gonna call him a moron and also nothing skittish about calling him a Nazi but he's a Nazi there's a Nazi in the Oval Office I just have some news for you so heads up Wow new haircut same old Cathy at least the saving grace is that virtually nobody was laughing at the Trump is a Nazi statement in fact the mood in the studio was understandably downright awkward people were clearly creeped out by Griffin's ludicrous rant now this isn't the first time the president has been compared to a Nazi Hollywood relic Lily Tomlin had this to say about Trump backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards earlier this year quote he's trying to change the laws you know my mind is going too fast I want to think about the fact that you know I don't want to make this comparison I'm not making it in any way but the Nazis they change the laws if they didn't agree with them they just changed them and they could do whatever they wanted end quote nice try Lily in not wanting to compare the President to a Nancy you kind of did so by throwing in the word Nazi and earlier that evening in front of the ssag crowd Lilly had this to say about the Trump presidency the boos day talk has been moved up to two and a half minutes before midnight I and this award it came just in the nick of time yeah the booms de clock and by the way does booms they come before or after doomsday regrettably the Trump as Nancy comparisons are so prevalent that last year gossip Capcom actually cataloged several instances leading off as louis c.k who's usually quite funny but he was very very unfunny in one interview when he noted that trump quote is hitler and by that i mean that we are being germany in the 30s do you think they saw the shit coming hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb-over who would say anything at all end quote then there's Eva Longoria who remark quote Hitler moved the nation with words just words end quote she later denied she was comparing Trump to Hitler releasing a statement that read I'm not saying Donald Trump himself is dangerous but that words can be dangerous yeah thanks for the clarification Eva but the all-time worst example has to be the appearance by Sarah Silverman on Conan O'Brien show in which she actually dressed up as Hitler to do her Trump rant don't get me wrong Conan I agree with a lot he says a lot like 90% of what he says I'm like this guy gotcha okay but it's just it's crap yeah yeah Trump is very very crass yeah where's Sarah she should have brought along one of those laugh track machines given the lack of guffaws being generated by the live studio audience the point is comparing any individual to Hitler is a fool's errand unless of course that particular individual is truly exhibiting Hitler like behavior you know like trying to engineer a genocide perhaps indeed the very fact that the so-called comedians can make Hitler jokes about Trump actually proves that Donald Trump is no Adolf Hitler because if Griffin and Tomlin and Silverman and all the rest tried to exercise their right to free speech in Germany of the 1930s by jokingly making unfavorable comparisons to the Fuhrer well they wouldn't even make it to the punch line for the rebel dot media I'm David the man Zoid Menzies hey we have an all-new fall lineup here at the rebel please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
