a fake ID so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he can vote I just</font>

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,460
wrote a persuasive essay about why the

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,780
voting age should be lowered to 16

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,390
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> still I've never felt more proud</font>

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,430
than when I put my first ballot in that

28
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,190
governor and governor again and governor

<font color="#E5E5E5">again but even with those more exciting</font>

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,960
races<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried never to skip out on</font>

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,030
elections for things like state

32
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">representative or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City Council because</font>

33
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,820
voting you guys is really important I

34
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,009
hear my peers say things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

35
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,240
don't vote because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody represents them or they don't</font>

37
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,930
feel like their vote matters but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

38
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,520
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know a cool thing some 120</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font>

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,390
million people vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> for president but</font>

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a lot less for your congressperson</font>

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,520
or your state or city government<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,130
your vote makes up a larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> share of the</font>

43
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,470
collective voice and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> little guys</font>

44
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,390
on the ticket that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably never</font>

45
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,460
even heard of it's quite likely that the

46
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,840
decisions they make have a more

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,399
immediate impact on your everyday life

48
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,890
than even what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> president does I</font>

49
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,439
mean still vote for president please

50
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,299
anything that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you to vote but</font>

51
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can all together</font>

52
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,650
make our world

53
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,110
a little better or a little worse but

54
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,080
trust me it's not a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

55
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody makes no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difference at all and</font>

56
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,410
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I get so excited</font>

57
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that little I voted sticker</font>

58
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,639
because politics tend to make people

59
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,830
feel cynical but you walk around an

60
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,260
election day among a sea of people with

61
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,170
that little sticker on of people that to

62
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,540
some degree somehow actually believed

63
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,020
that together we matter and I know that

64
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,810
we do so if you're in the US and you're

65
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,450
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm I want to vote but I don't</font>

66
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,640
really know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how that works you're in</font>

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">luck i happen to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written a handy</font>

68
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,959
series that will tell you everything

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,459
that you need to do to vote in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

70
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,620
particular state or territory go watch

71
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,600
it learn the things get registered

72
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,390
sooner than later and vote in the

73
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,640
comments tell me a story of either the

74
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,740
first time you voted or another time

75
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,870
that your voice mattered if you liked
