O'Keefe made some real news yesterday because he had talked to a insider over at Twitter a former Twitter staffer and this Twitter staffer explained in full living detail is that Twitter apparently shadow bans people where Twitter will downgrade particular tweets prevent people from seeing them I've heard this about my own tweets in the past that Twitter that I'll tweet something out and people who follow me don't actually see the tweet it's really disturbing here's a little bit from the James O'Keefe tape this is undercover tape with with one of the members of the Twitter staff so count that will you and then your discretion because they keep posting but no one sees their context so they just think that no one's engaging with their content there's a low and here's what they're saying so there's a guy named Abhinav Padre was a former Twitter software engineer and he says shadow Manning takes place he says one strategy is to shadow ban so you have ultimate control the idea of a shadow ban is that you ban someone but they don't know they've been banned because they keep posting and no one sees their content so they just think no one is engaging when they're content when in reality no one is seeing it Twitter software engineer Stephen Pierce said quote every single conversation is gonna be rated by a machine and machine is going to say whether or not it's a positive thing or a negative thing and whether it's positive or negative doesn't and then it's inaudible it's more like if somebody's being aggressive or not right somebody's just cursing at somebody they may have a point but it will just vanish it's not gonna ban the mindset it's gonna ban a way of talking oh Linda Hasan is a policy matter for Twitter's trust and safety team which is the most Orwellian name and they say they are working on down ranking bad people it's something we're working on we're trying to get the bleep he people not to show up it's a product thing that we're working on right now and then there was another guy who you heard at the very beginning a guy named Owen awry who's a Twitter content review agent and they say that in the past they would manually ban or censor pro-trump or conservative content they said yeah and they said if this is pro Trump I don't want it because it's offend because it offends me and I say and I say I banned this whole thing and that it goes over here and they're like oh you know what I don't like it to Moe's right let's go let's carry on what's next they said that more left-leaning content would go through their selection process with less political scrutiny okay this is not a tremendous shock if you've ever been on Twitter there's been a lot of talk about this for years this has been rumored for years obviously the people who have been banned on Twitter and they're people who I am not particularly fond of and some of the alt-right Twitter trolls the people who have been banned I'm not a fan of their stuff but the idea that they get banned and a bunch of people on the Left don't get banned for similar content from the left is just insane to me it's not a shock that Twitter is downgrading content we found out earlier this week by the way that Google is basically downgrading content from conservatives how do we know because right now if you go over to Google comm and you search the name of the website that I run daily wire which is 8 which is a fully credible site ok most of what we do is aggregate news from other sources most of what we are doing is taking the news and then adding a bit of commentary to it so we're it's very rare that we actually report original news at Daily wire nonetheless if you actually go over to Daily wire on Google and you search daily wire there's something that pops up and what pops up is something that says on the right side of the page writes about and then it'll show some of our old pieces and then there's a thing they click on and it says reviewed claims ok reviewed claims are a bunch of claims that come from Snopes and climate feedback and factcheck.org in fact all of the leftist fact-checking organizations and Snopes is a left-wing fact-checking organization they have a nasty habit of taking a factual statement or right-wing or makes and then drawing some sort of conclusion from that statement and then arguing with the conclusion that they are drawing from that statement PolitiFact they do the same thing a lot of these backchecking organizations aren't actually fact-checking the fact that's being espoused instead what they are doing is fact-checking some conclusion that they draw from the facts so for example I remember PolitiFact's did a very long review of a video that I did about how many people in Muslim countries have extremist beliefs my entire video was based on poll results from Pew Research at Global right it was at the entire the entire video that I did you can view it has several million hits at this point is me just saying a certain percentage of the population of Pakistan believes suicide bombings are OK for example so what did PolitiFact do they couldn't argue with any of the poll numbers out citing instead they argued with my definition of extremist so when I said that extremists to believe that Sharia law should rule they would say well that depends on your definition of Sharia law are they just saying the cheerio law should rule in their own country or globally okay that you arguing with my definition that doesn't mean what I'm saying is false right you're arguing with my conclusion which is fine and that's a matter of opinion that's not a matter of fact PolitiFact ranked my entire video false though the most hilarious part of that politifact fact check is that they did their own calculation they found something like twenty percent of the entire Muslim population on planet Earth was extreme by their own calculation meaning that some 200 million people are extreme and then in their own fact-check they say but we don't want to draw that conclusion or anything well we were not comfortable with the conclusions that were drawn the reason all this is a problem is because there's an attempt now to reassert gatekeeping from the top there's an attempt that's happening right now in real time to reassert the gatekeeping of news and a lot of this is driven by the fake news mania that the left has pushed in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton losing the election so Hillary lost we can't just say she lost because she's a crappy candidate instead we are going to say the reason that she lost is because of fake news it's because people are putting out stuff that was false now there are stories that are actually false but they're stories about how pizza gate was real for example where there's no factual basis to it whatsoever okay that's actual thick news then there's stuff you disagree with and unfortunately because the left disagrees with so much of what the right has to say what you see very often is the left actually engaging in a process where they will shut down the the dissemination of conservative oriented news because they're saying it's a factual or counterfactual that's not true that's not true so you've seen there's been talk about this on some of the major on some of the major websites it's certainly true on Google that how you search on Google is very different than the search results that you received from another web engine like Bing the obviously twitter has been downgrading conservatives for a while so what James O'Keefe uncovered here is something that's very troubling it's one of the reasons why for example YouTube has gotten itself in serious trouble they demonetised a video that I did with Dave Rubin the other day which is the least controversial political video of all time they D monetized a conversation I do with Blair white on transgenderism which is a very friendly conversation with a transgender person about the pronouns that ought to be used in addressing transgender people that was demonetised right YouTube has demonetised a lot of university videos so much so the Prager University is suing YouTube now is that a lawsuit that can sustain I'm not sure it can because these are all private companies but it is certainly true that we do have a troubling situation that people should know about when all of the major ways that you gain your news are being curated by a bunch of lefties on the top who are biasing the newsfeed in favor of their own in their own favorite political beliefs knowing that other media outlets will praise them for doing so so good on okie for doing this and this is something you should keep an eye on just because news is being downgraded by an outlet does not mean that that news is fake news I mean as I say daily wire is is now has these reviewed claims over at Google guess what doesn't slate Huffington Post salon right none of these have this right none of them CNN none of them have the the the reviewed claims aspect instead they're just using left-wing fact checkers to fact-check it's not just Daily wire by the way it's Daily Caller it's the Federalists it's only right-wing sites basically which is just insane okay in a second I want to discuss another way that the left is shutting down debate but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at tracker so you lost your keys you lost your wallet you're searching for them again it takes you an hour you're late to your meeting this has happened to me so many times I cannot count my wife used to lose her phone on a regular basis like I know when I say regular I mean like twice a day like every place we'd go she turned me and say where's my phone what have to worry about that anymore thanks to tracker tracker changes everything when they released a first tracking device they changed the entire market now they have the tracker pixel it is the whole latest Bluetooth tracking device on the market you put tracker pixel on whatever you tend to lose your keys your wallet your purse it is small enough to fit anywhere and when you misplace an item that has a tracker pixel attached to it you can use your smart phone and a 90 decibel alert will help you find it in seconds so this beeping noise even has a powerful LED light so you can find anything in the dark and if you lose your phone here's the coolest thing you lose your phone you can't find it okay but you turned your ringer off so now you're trying to dial it and locate it by the ring but the ringers off so what do you do well if you have the tracker pixel you hit the track or pixel on your keychain and it actually overrides the sound settings on your phone and that means that you can now find your phone even if it's even if the sound is off which is a super cool thing you can even locate your item if it's miles away because every tracker user is part of the largest crowd locate network in the world sort of like Waze except finding your stuff tractor has a 30-day money-back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose check it out 20% off your order when you go to the track our comm / Ben that's the e th e track our comm / Ben you get 20% off again that's the tracker comm / Ben again it's one of those things you don't think about until it makes your life inordinately easier and that's what the tracker comm / Ben is where he's that / Ben's that they know that we sent you okay so in other ways that the left has been shutting down to bait there is this tape going around of steven pinker steven pinker is not a right-wing finger a figure as Steven Pinker is a professor at Harvard I took the class when I was at Harvard Law School with Pinker and Alan Dershowitz which is kind of a fun class and Pinker is of course the author of a book called the blank slate one of the things that makes Pinker controversial among a lot of people on the left is that Pinker doesn't believe in the ultimate malleability of human beings he believes that the reason he titled his book the blank slate is because he was saying that that perception of humans that we are a blank slate and that we don't have any natural inclination we don't have any natural presets he says that's nonsense and that means that we're constantly battling with our own nature in order to change well Steven Pinker was doing a panel for spikes magazine the unsafe space tour panel at Harvard Pinker has come under fire recently because he'll say things that are true like women may have different different interests in than men do in the career space which may account for some of the discrepancies between men and women in terms of science staffing right he'll say things like statistically speaking blacks commit crimes more often than whites and then he'll explain why that is that that has nothing to do with race per se it has more to do with culture it has more to do with history it maybe has to do with they made a stir with poverty but he's willing to say facts that people on the left are not willing to say so Pinker in discussing this starts talking about how political correctness has really led to the rise of the alt-right then what political correctness has done is it is said to a lot of people that you're not even allowed to say facts like men and women are different or that race has commit crimes at different rates because if you say that then people are afraid of the conclusions are gonna draw so we're talking earlier about how the fact-checking organizations do this they don't like the poll results that I cite so instead they argue with the conclusion that I say and then label the polls that I say it Falls right this is what Pinker says he says if he can't even acknowledge the on-the-ground facts what you're actually doing is helping people in the alt-right because here's the logic they're a bunch of people in the alt-right and/or who are not even in the alright yet and they will say listen I'm looking at the statistics and what I see is that black people commit more crimes than white people on an average per capita basis and then people are muffled oh that's not true you can't say that you're a racist and then people on the right will say you know people who not even on the right people who will see that fact will say well if it's taboo for me to even cite that fact maybe it's taboo maybe it's also taboo but not false to be racist about that fact it suggests that the race is inherently what's driving the crime right if the politically correct people would say that's a true fact now here's the explanation that has nothing to do with racism which by the way is not a left thing and something that I do on a regular basis when I'm arguing against the alt right but the left won't do that the left will and acknowledge the common basis of fact instead they will just say you're not allowed to mention the fact because the fact itself is racist so this is what Pinker says and Pinker just got shellacked for this I mean he's just getting destroyed by the left here is what Pinker had to say in his own words the other way in which I I do agree with my fellow panelists that that political correctness has done an enormous amount of harm in in the sliver of the population that might be I wouldn't want to say persuadable but certainly whose affiliation might be up for grabs comes from the often highly literate highly intelligent people who gravitate to the alt-right internet savvy media savvy who often are radicalized in that way who swallowed the red pill as the saying goes the illusion from from from the matrix when they are exposed to the first time to true statements that have never been voiced in college campuses or in the New York Times or in respectable media that are almost like a bacillus to which they have no immunity and they are immediately infected with both a feeling of outrage that these truths are unassailable and no defense against taking them to what we might consider to be rather repellant conclusion so here is a fact that's going to sound regionally controversial but is not and that is that capitalist societies are better than communist ones here's another one men and women are are not identical in their life priorities in their sexuality in their in their tastes and interests a third fact that is just not controversial although it sounds controversial well that is the different ethnic groups commit violent crimes at different rates now if you've never heard these facts before and you stumble across them or someone mentions them it is possible to to come to some extreme conclusions such as that that women are inferior that african-americans are naturally violent that we all ought to be anarcho-capitalists and and do away with all regulation and social safety nets that the most terrorism in this country is the fault of Muslims the first time you hear them you're apt to say number one the truth has been withheld from me by universities by mainstream media number and moreover you will be vindicated when people who voice these truths are suppressed shouted down assaulted all the more reason to believe that the that the left that the mainstream media that universities can't handle the truth so the politically correct left is doing itself an enormous just so we can stop it there so we can hear him say right is that the point here is that people are taking these facts and then they're drawing the wrong conclusions but when the left argues that the facts don't exist it's driving people to embrace the wrong conclusions so he's anti outright he's trying to explain why the politically correct left is creating the alt right it's the same stuff that I've been saying on this program for years it's the same thing that I've said about the identity politics of the left that when you push an identity politics that suggests that race and ethnicity are primary you can't be surprised when people who are not of your race and ethnicity start to treat their own race and ethnicity as primary it's a mistake by those people they shouldn't be doing it but you have to knowledge the forces at work in the universe that are pushing people toward these nasty horrible groups and there's no one who's more anti outright than I am I think I can safely say that considering that was their number one target in 2016 and that I've been ragingly anti outright ever since they became prominent force in the American in the American political scene Pinkert just gets destroyed for this so they're a bunch of people on the Left who think now that Pinker isn't who's acting that they think steven pinker the leftist Harvard professor who is on the left okay I took a class with him I've read his books Steven Pinker is not a right winger he's an atheist he he believes in government programs big government programs he's ripped as an alt writer so PZ Myers of free thought blogs wrote The Pinker sympathies lie with the alt right that's an absolute slander he says I am shocked that a Harvard professor would promote such ignorance and falsehoods but of course none of the facts that Pinker States there are mildly rebuttable they're not rebuttable and Myers makes no attempts to rebut them Joshua Loftus a professor at New York University he said the Pinker's ideas were worse than the edited clip they're just amazing Jamelle Bouie of slate who I've had fights with over over this sort of stuff before he suggested that Pinker had claimed that blacks cause crime and Jews control the world which of course is not what Pinker is saying right what Pinker is saying is that there are black people in America have a higher crime rate but then he explicitly denounces the idea that the race is connected with the crime rate he says there are other factors that are relevant in assessing whether race is connected with crime and to comes the conclusion that rates causes crime is stupid right but people are ignoring that because they're using exactly the same sort of PC censorship the Pinker is talking about the drives people be all right hey professor Jesse Daniels of Hunter College says if one were saying writing a book about the mainstreaming of white nationalism one would certainly consider featuring this as supporting evidence for one's main point it's just this is insane okay that's not real that's not a Pinker is saying at all but that's the astonishing thing about the left is they are so utterly incapable of even looking internally at what they've done to promote this nastiness that instead they continue to engage in exactly the same tactics that make the nastiness more likely and more and more prominent it's really an incredible thing when you're ripping down Steven Pinker it's so funny when I was going to Harvard Law Alan Dershowitz it was on the left and Steven Pinker was on the left and now by the time ya there I graduated in 2007 now 11 years later Steven Pinker is on the Steven Pinker is on the right apparently he's now an alt writer and Alan Dershowitz is a Trumpkin okay I don't think that Alan Dershowitz is Steven Pinker changed all that much I think the left changed all that much I think the left aside the same left that decided that Larry Summers who was ousted from the presidency of the University when I was there for stating that women may have different aptitudes and interests in science and math and men right that same University now says that Steven Pinker is is to be ousted the Steven Pinker has to be targeted you wonder how people like sam harris and steven pinker and i all end up on the same side of the aisle on this stuff and we disagree about virtually everything else maybe the reason is because the left is so extreme and radical that they're driving away an entire contingent to people who just want to talk about facts even if they draw different conclusions from those facts I cannot have a discussion with people will not operate in the same world the facts that I operate I can't have a discussion with Steven Pinker and that I think is what drives the left up a wall and so instead they use censorship as a way of preventing honest and open discussion about issues that matter okay before I go any further I will I do have to show you the pictures of the Obama library I think it does say something about Obama as a human really I'm not exaggerating but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Skillshare so it's a brand new year it is time for you to make a resume deeper it is time for you to

this is Obama was approved this this library really it looks like for those who can't see it and are just listening it looks like gonk from Star Wars Episode four remember the robot with the feet that kind of walks around yeah there's gunk right so it kind of looks like that alright so it looks like gunk from it looks like a Chinese food takeout box that was open and then left in the Sun and it's it's it's this weirdly Orwellian looking building it's supposed to symbolize four hands coming together which I don't understand at all I don't understand how this is hands it looks like just a weird building that looks like a tower off the off the side of the Death Star and it really does and and then it has a Sports Center so people can play sports at the Obama Presidential Library and it's supposed to overlook a walkway outside so that you can look down on all the little people it really is an amazing thing now here's what it says about Obama look look how hideous this is I mean this is just hideous crap if you look at the Bush Presidential Library it's kind of a classy looking building if you look at any of the old presidential libraries they're all nice-looking the Nixon Presidential Library is beautiful the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is beautiful this is just a hideous eyesore that apparently is being built by modernists and those modernists do not know how to build anything remotely interesting looking it looks like it looks like a Soviet bloc or a modernist art piece just ugly is all sin my goodness gracious and then my understanding is that this weird segment on the on the corner is supposed to be words now I can't actually read any of those words because I think they only use the top half of the letters but it's supposed to emphasize how important were how important words were to Obama which makes perfect sense because the guy sucked at governing so words were the only thing that he was good at here's the part that I find really interesting so in 2011 he said he wanted be an architect did Obama so he said when I was there was a time I dreamed of being an architect so as you might guess I've been pretty hands on on the plans for the sunroom and Michelle has too so Obama who thinks he's an architect helps come up with the plans for this hideous hideous monstrosity that's not a shock because you remember in 2008 he said I think I'm a better speech writer than my speech writers I know more about policies on any particular issue and my policy directors and I'll tell you right now I'm gonna think I'm a better political director and my political director it was that sort of arrogance and self-centeredness that led him to being a bad president he was not better at any of these things than the people he delegated to and he is not a better architect than my one and a half year old child who can at least build a box out of magna tiles okay this is hideous crap and it's it's fitting for a hideous presidency so there you have it just ugly ugly ugly I don't know it is about Democrats and ugly presidential libraries here's a picture of the Clinton Presidential Library let's go grab that one this has been mocked for years because it looks like a double-wide trailer it's a very weird looking Presidential Library in fact I know a local radio host in Arkansas who went and stuck a bunch of pink flamingos in front of it as a prank because it looks like a double-wide trailer it's the I don't know why maybe maybe only Republicans are capable of building beautiful presidential libraries because this one is just they're all ugly ugly like okay so to get to some actual news today the the President of the United States decided to confuse everyone with a couple of tweets this is the breaking news so the house is now reconsidering the renewal of the FISA Act the FISA Act is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the the FISA Act sets up a system whereby intelligence agencies have to go to secret FISA courts in order to obtain warrants for domestic wiretapping particularly and the idea is that you're not supposed to give a warrant for domestic targets you're supposed to be targeting foreign surveillance right foreign targets and if people get caught up and that they get caught up in that this is one of the big arguments over whether Trump was wiretap or manna fort was wire tapped when the FBI was attempting to wiretap foreign sources right when they were looking for a wiretap on Carter page where they actually for a wiretap on Carter page if so did that violate the Fourth Amendment or was that they were having a wiretap on foreign sources and those foreign sources were talking Trump and talking to Manta for and therefore they were sort of swept up in this foreign intelligence surveillance so the the Trump administration had come out and endorsed the the RiRi offering of section 702 702 again sets up significant limitations on the Lawrence that may be granted wiretap most significantly quote may not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States and shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution meaning that you could sue and say that you were wiretapped wrongly and it would violate the Fourth Amendment so yesterday the White House press secretary gave this statement they said the administration strongly opposes the USA Rights Amendment so the FISA Amendment reauthorization act which the house will consider tomorrow this amendment would reestablish the walls between intelligence and law enforcement thinner country knocked down following the attacks of 9/11 in order to increase information sharing and improve our national security so there is an attempt to amend section 702 so that intelligence agencies couldn't share information as easily supposedly in order to protect Fourth Amendment rights but there was one problem Trump watched Fox and Friends this morning so his administration comes out and says don't endorse us a rights Trump watches Fox and Friends Judge Napolitano comes on and gives a monologue at 6:47 a.m. urging from not to back FISA reauthorization and minutes later minutes later Trump tweets quote house votes on controversial FISA act today this is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony dossier to so badly surveil and abused the Trump campaign by the previous administration and others question mark so then he got calls from his administration like people inside saying mr. president we endorsed this yesterday literally yesterday so 90 minutes later Trump comes out any tweets with that being said I personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today's vote is about forward surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land we need it get smart so then ninety minutes he has completely reversed his position and by the way fibbed about this he's directed the fix to the unmasking process you can't direct a fix to the unmasking process it's part of the law right I mean the law itself would have to be changed now does any of this matter in the end no because I don't think anybody takes Trump's verbiage on on policy completely seriously but for probably ninety minutes every Republican in the world was panicking and for ninety minutes all the Republicans were going what the world is he talking about and that's why I think that a lot of the emphasis a lot of the fear about what Trump is doing on policy is a little bit overblown you can't take Trump seriously on policy or literally on policy all you can do is watch what the administration does because Trump frankly doesn't know what he's talking about on policy a lot of the time we saw that in his immigration meeting the other day when he reversed himself on daca a clean deferred action for childhood arrivals bill he reversed himself on that in the course of 40 seconds when informed by Kevin McCarthy that he didn't know what he was talking about so a lot of his base is very upset with him over this a lot of Trump's base is very angry at him for supposedly signaling that he's going to show tremendous flexibility on illegal immigration I think that his base is getting out in front of itself I think that a lot of the people like Coulter Laura Ingraham Tucker Carlson I think a lot of these people are taking from literally and seriously and they should not be doing either the reality is Trump was having a meeting he thought of it as a meeting he doesn't care that much about the policy and he's not gonna be the one who is setting policy as he made pretty clear he said basically congressional Republicans you're the ones who are in charge of this I'm gonna show you

podcast in the nation all right so yesterday the base lost it against TRO over over Trump's words on illegal immigration so we'll start with Laura Ingraham Laura on Fox who's been an immigration hardliner through and through she says that she is very unhappy with how Trump was talking and all I would suggest to to Laura I sound like a trump can hear but I'm not hot right I'm gonna suggest to Laura that she is she's not trusting Trump enough and what I mean by that is not that you should trust Trump on policy you should trust the people around Trump on policy get some paint shaping the policy see this is a great problem if you are a worshipper of Trump personally is you think this is all part of Trump's plan you think that Trump is sitting around playing that 40 Magne Magne Magne chess that's not what's going on Trump is saying stuff right what-you-see-is-what-you-get Trump is just saying things and those things that he are saying he'll flip on them inside of an hour already tweeted out a bunch of stuff that completely contradicted what he had said to Dianne Feinstein about illegal immigration right he had sent out his press secretary to say that they would consider amnesty for illegal immigrants and then five minutes later they sent out pens to saying that they are committed to the promises that they made so here is it let's do Mike Pence actually first and then we'll show the reaction so Mike Pence the vice president he's asked about Trump on illegal immigration and here is the vice president this president this administration are absolutely committed to keep the promises we made to the American people I mean as the president said last weekend at Camp David there's no daca fix without a wall we're gonna build a wall we're gonna end chain migration we're gonna end the visa lottery program and we're gonna deal with daca but we're gonna do it in a way that will meet the expectation of the American people okay so there it is you know pence basically is defining policy I think a lot more than Trump is on a lot of this stuff which is a good thing right that is a that is a nice wonderful good thing for conservatives but Laura Ingraham and Carlson are very angry listen I'll give them credit good for them for actually being critical of the president when they think the president is doing something wrong I think that they are under estimating or they're both under estimating Trump and overestimating from there are under estimating Trump in the sense that they are saying that Trump is gonna break promises because he's not a promise keeper I agree with that to a certain extent they are overestimating Trump if they think he's actually in control of policy because he really is not here is Laura Ingraham going after Trump on exactly these grounds I'm gonna wait to see what the final doctor proposal looks like but if it does not include a wall a real wall not a see-through wall expect a political revolt from the base which means losing the house and maybe even losing the Senate and by the way chain migration absolutely necessary okay so what she's saying there is is right on policy we should build the wall the wall by the way is like fourth priority in terms of if you're going to reform immigration the other priorities are Eve Arif I making sure that employers aren't allowed to hire illegal immigrants you have to have also the the end of chain migration so if you come in legally and then you bring your entire family and that has to be ended in the visa well the visa lottery program has to be ended as well the wall is like forth on that list but in any case she's not wrong on policy all I'm suggesting is that all these people who are members of the base listen I'm happy that they finally arrived at the point that I was at a while ago calling balls and strikes with Trump I'm glad that they're finally saying that Trump does something that they don't like that they'll break with Trump but if they think that Trump is actually that yesterday was anything more that his meeting with Democrats was anything more than posturing I think that that's wrong Tucker Carlson was on the same page he was saying the same thing on Fox News last night listen it's good to pressure Trump I've been doing it too welcome to party pal Congress is full of people from both parties who believe at the point of our immigration policy is to provide cheap labor to their donors and to atone for America's imaginary sins against the world they couldn't care less about immigrations effect on you or your family yet these are the same people the president now says he trusts to write the immigration bill the one he'll sign no matter what it says so what was the point of running for president okay so he's not wrong on this but again I would suggest that that Trump is not actually the policies not gonna look like this the policies gonna look like what Congress shapes and whatever Congress is able to get through the Republican Senate they're not gonna get any Democratic help on this the question is what they get through the Republican Senate I would hope that they get the ending of chain migration the the ending of the diversity Visa Lottery some funding for the wall so Trump can claim victory on the wall but the idea that that Trump was serious about any of this I think is utterly untrue the part that I would be disquieted about here is not what Trump does on immigration actually the part that I would be disquieted about is what Trump does when there's a Democratic Congress which as I've been saying now for four weeks is why Congress matters and it's why Republican scandals matter so speaking of Republican scandals a really bad Republican scandal broke yesterday okay it's it's it's not good so late on Wednesday evening news broke that in all likelihood we'll end the career of the Missouri governor Eric Greitens he was sort of an up-and-coming Republican star at X Navy SEAL so apparently he'd been having an extramarital affair but that's not the worst part of the story the worst part of the story is that the ex-husband of greetin's ex mistress came forward with a tape in which the woman talked about her relationship with greetin's and apparently here's what happened this according to the woman basically she says that he invited her over to his house that he told her that he was going to show her how to do a proper pull-up which is a very interesting come-on line that she acceded to his request that he proceeded to tape her hands to rings blindfold her get her naked and then take a picture of her and then take that picture and say basically if anything ever comes out about this this picture is gonna hit the press so he's basically attempting to use revenge porn as a way to blackmail this woman allegedly now he denies that he says the governor has now seen the TV report that ran tonight this is his team the station declined to provide the tape or transcript in advance of running their story which contain multiple false allegations the claim that this nearly three year old story has generated or should generate law-enforcement interest is completely false there was no black clam blackmail and that claim is false it doesn't matter the allegations are serious enough that this is now going to dog him I think the chances that he remains in office are relatively low again if this woman comes out and says that this is true particularly then it sounds it sounds like this I wouldn't be surprised there are other shoes to drop here if it turns out that that this attack that they did used before because that said this doesn't sound like something you do is one-off now you're gonna have an affair and you just think of this on the spot okay I'm to get you naked tape you up and then I'm gonna and they're gonna take a picture of you yeah that sounds rather unlikely one of the things that I find so disturbing about stories like this is it does go to whether character matters in politics because there will be a group of people undoubtedly who will say okay so he did all this stuff can he govern right this isn't this is where we but this is where we've now landed I do wonder if we've if we've hit rock bottom with this if there's still people who are outraged enough by this activity if it's true to oust Greitens or if there gonna be a bunch of people who say the same thing they said about Roy Moore which is okay well even if it's true that he was allegedly molesting fourteen-year-old girls even if that turns out to be true maybe he'll be a good senator right has character gone so far out that there's no way to bring it back in and does that matter does that movin discuss if it's been an ongoing topic for a couple of years now among Republicans does character matter at all not doesn't matter a little doesn't matter at all because we've been continuously defining deviancy down yes JFK was a perv but that was secret from the American public and if the American public had found out that JFK was a perv in 1963 he's not reelect ydynt eensy for yes LBJ was a piece of crap but none of that information was public knowledge so there have been bad men who have been president before going all the way back to the beginning but though that was hidden from the American public because the public did not tolerate that and that does have an effect on the culture that we all inhabit together maybe it's true that people of low character can be good politicians maybe it's true the Ted Kennedy can leave a woman to drown after presumably having an affair with her and leaving her in the back of a car in the middle of the river maybe it's true that he can go on to be a very powerful and influential senator but what is also true is that a society that suggests that character does not matter when it comes to people who are making policy is a society that is going to treat character as completely irrelevant and that's I think where we are going is Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan coined this phrase defining deviancy down in 1993 he wrote this about crime he said over the past generation the amount of deviant behavior in American society has increased beyond the levels the community can afford to recognize and accordingly we have been redefining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized and also quietly raising the normal levels in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard and this is certainly not true only of crime it is also true with regard to personal behavior of politicians and that bleeds down to what we accept in our personal lives not just with regard to career but what you're willing to accept in a friend right what you're willing to accept in a community what you're willing to accept in a church these do have widespread effects right there was a lot of talk after Bill Clinton that there are a lot younger people who are engaging in in oral sexual activity because Bill Clinton had basically made that a byword I think that there's been statistics to show that various types of sexual activity that were hitherto considered taboo as they are defined down as those are no longer considered deviant they're tried more often and then the human psyche is just to look for the new taboo as we continue to search for the new taboo we're gonna continue to lower the character of the American people it doesn't mean every taboo is worthwhile or that certain taboos shouldn't be broken obviously there's certain taboos that should be broken for example the most obvious example be interracial marriage which was a taboo for centuries and that was broken and no harm no foul not only no harm no foul I think positive good but the idea that that every taboo should be shattered and that when we shatter taboos we're definitely moving society forward instead of backwards I think it's a mistake and it leads to a lower character for the American people for sure okay so in a second I want to get to some things that I like and some things that I hate so let's do a couple of let's do a couple of things that I like so we begin with black mirror season four so black mirror season four I've watched a couple of episodes the first episode of black mayor season four is really tremendous if you haven't seen it yet it's called the USS Callister that features Jesse Plemons who's become one of my favorite character actors I really like him and he plays this this tech guru who basically creates a Star Trek reality for himself inhabited by other people that he knows and it's it doesn't go the direction you think it's gonna go it's really it's funny it's it's it's interesting it's our rated black mirror it's always hard but here's a little bit of the preview for season four of black mirror it's hard to enjoy bright future but we can and we must anyone hello a stupid mental full system nothing is gonna happen okay so the whole point of black mirror is that technology is twisting us in ways that we don't even think about and that's why it's interesting to watch it does raise some issues about exactly how we treat technology that are worth thinking about and that's what makes it fun it sort of like Twilight Zone but technology-based Twilight Zone really good series if you haven't seen the beginning episodes I say that season 1 is the best season 2 is also quite good I thought season 3 was a bit of a fall off what I've seen so far in season 4 I think is is actually better than season 3 so check it out Black Mirror season 4 ok other things that I like so this I just found hysterical apparently they're a bunch of people on the Left who no longer want to engage with with pink hats so these are these are now a thing of the past these professor these people on the Left are no longer interested in pushing it why because according to the detroit free pass quote the pink hat excludes and is offensive to transgender women and gender 9 but non-binary people who don't have typical female genitalia and to women of color because their genitals are more likely to be brown than pink yes peak wolken is as Jamie Couric says just these people are geniuses they are just wonderful heartbreaking geniuses because genitals are of different colors we cannot have pink hats now we have to have hats that resemble the actual genitalia themselves I can't imagine why you guys are alienating voters I cannot imagine it please keep going down this path because it's working out fantastically for you God's people are so stupid ok other things that I like so there's a story out and people are going crazy over Mark Wahlberg was paid 1,500 times more than Michelle McWilliams for the reshoots on his on the movie what's name of this movie all the money in the world they had to reshoot it because Kevin Spacey was in it and then they Christopher Plummer and so they do reshoot so Kevin Spacey oh so Mark Wahlberg got 1.5 million bucks for the reshoot Williams receives an $80 per diem that amounted to less than a thousand dollars and so people were like oh my god William Morris Endeavor how dare they not get great pay for Michelle Williams she volunteered it's a free country if Mark Wahlberg was smart enough to understand that he had the the studio over a barrel and he could do whatever he wanted and you get paid a lot of money that's fine also if you're talking about box office draws there is no the mark Whalberg is a much bigger box office try the Michele Williams and just there's no doubt about it I mean just look at the statistics it's not true I love the idea that this is blatant sexism as though Wahlberg's getting paid more not because he's a better negotiator but because he's a man not because the bigger start but because he's a man if that's the truth I'd like to say I'd like to talk about pay discrepancies on oceans eight where everybody is a woman I guarantee you the Julia Roberts was paid significantly more than other women on the film in fact Olivia Munn who does a a cameo in the film says that she had to pay out of her own pocket to be in the film that they made her pay for her own costume I promise you Julia Roberts was paid several million dollars to be in ocean's 8 obvious sexism obvious sexism because Olivia Munn is a woman and Julia Roberts is a man or something this stuff is so stupid you know before you start claiming such as some racism privilege why don't you look to the complicating factors in the same way that before you claim that race is responsible for crime you might want to look to the complicating factors so stupid okay time for a couple of things that I hate alright so a couple of things I hate first of all I saw one of the worst movies that I've ever seen I was on is in a car from Las Vegas I had flown there the flight back was delayed so he drove there's a movie called good time that just came out with Robert Pattinson getting all sorts of great reviews it is a full avoid this you know run the other way it is so bad he's he's a very good actor Robert Pattinson it is shockingly he could take Robert Pattinson he's a very good actor and Kristen Stewart who's also a good actress and make Twilight which is a horrific horrific film right it's just an amazing truth but this is a good evidence that good acting doesn't mean good good movie good time is just ah it's sure garbage I won't even play any of the preview I had our guys pull the preview I won't play it because I wouldn't subject you to that okay other things that I hate this I have to show you apparently this has become a new trend it's called pose dancing it's a new dance style I suppose and it's being pushed out there I guess it's it's called figuring is the new thing where you're supposed to form certain figures here is what it looks like if you can't see this it's people who look like they're about to hurl and convulsing and posing what now it look like they're about to be taken up by aliens like that like that the beam is about to come down or like they're being controlled by an out-of-body experience that's there on the end of it they've got no strings to hold them down so this is a thing okay if there's so let me just say if there are a lot of worries about white people can't dance before this I think it is fair to say that white people cannot dance is gonna become a thing after this because what the actual f what in the world are we even looking at right now you know remember that time when I said that art is different from skill remember that time when I said that that actual skill actual craft matters when you look like you're having some sort of seizure just know just just just know okay I can't go anywhere from there we're gonna have to end the show there because it is blowing my mind it's just it's too much guys please don't do that anymore just stop just stop the love God stop okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest in
