look you don't have to like Trump III like him but I'm pretty sure Stephen Harper didn't like Barack Obama and vice versa but they still work together more or less for the benefit of their respective companies countries they didn't squabble they didn't engage in insults it's true that Donald Trump has started to ratchet things up in his Trumpy way I mean he called Canada spoiled will get along with Mexico will get along with Canada but I will tell you they have been very difficult to deal with they're very spoiled because nobody's done this that's tough talk but I've never actually seen Donald Trump take aim at Justin Trudeau himself who Trump repeatedly praises and calls a friend my friend Justin I like Justin Trudeau he says that but the Liberals are a hundred percent personal in their attacks on Trump Trudeau the most I've been very very clear in my approach as a feminist as someone who has stood clearly and strongly all my life around issues of sexual harassment standing against violence against women that I don't need to make any further comment at this time yeah I think it's better if Trump ignores Canada I'm sort of glad he hasn't been here in 500 days if Trump separates Canada from Mexico before he pummels Mexico I think that's a good thing I think it's been our good luck that Trump has not visited us and I think it's good news that he's only going to the g7 in and out and he's really focused on North Korea and Iran and China instead of us don't you think but one day and I fear that day is imminent Donald Trump will pay attention to all the insults hurled at him all the time and he will punch back hard and it won't just hit Trudeau which would make me chuckle it will hit all of us and you know what I actually think Justin Trudeau wants that to happen because while it will devastate our economy it'll make Trudeau the world's anti-trump martyr and no one will love him hard then the government journalists at the CBC state broadcaster I think a trade war a personal war of words with the US president will hurt Canada badly but if it gives Justin Trudeau an easier enemy to campaign against in the next federal election than the Conservative Party and if it'll make Trudeau the toast of the town of the United Nations well it almost sounds like it was Gerald buses plan all along doesn't it watch an excerpt from my daily TV show the Azrael events show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
