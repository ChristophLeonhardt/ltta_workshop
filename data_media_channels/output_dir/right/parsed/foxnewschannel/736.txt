EACH OTHER.
>> Laura: THANK YOU, DOG.
CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS
DENIES THAT SHE SAID ANYTHING
THAT EQUATES TO WHAT SHE CLAIMS
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAYS ABOUT
STIRRING UP VIOLENCE AGAINST THE
OPPOSITION.
JOINING US NOW, MIKE HUCKABEE.
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> THANKS SHANNON, GREAT TO BE
HERE.
AND FOR MAXINE WATERS TO SAY
THAT SHE DIDN'T SAY WHAT WE SAW
HER STAY ON CAMERA TELLS US A
>> Laura: IT YOU WROTE AN
INTERESTING PIECE DEFENDING OUR
DAUGHTER AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT
VANDALIZE THEIR MENU.
HE SAY YOU SHOULDN'T SEEK TO THE
SAME LEVEL.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT DOESN'T GAIN ANYTHING.
I THINK MY DAUGHTER HANDLED THIS
NOT ONLY SKILLFULLY BUT I THINK
RESPECTFULLY AND SHE DID IT IN A
BUT LET'S KEEP IN MIND WHY SHE
SHE DIDN'T THROW FOOD ON ANYONE,
SHE WASN'T DRUNK.
SHE GOT THROWN OUT BECAUSE SHE
WORKED FOR THE PRESIDENT OF
UNITED STATES.
WHEN YOU DENY A MILAN PERSON'S
LIBERTY BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
AND THAT IS WHAT OUGHT TO BE OF
CONCERN TO PEOPLE.
>> Laura: SHE HAD SOME
INTERESTING
RIGHT TIME OR PLACE TO BE GOING
AFTER PEOPLE.
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE
DINNER, TALKING ABOUT HER AND
OTHERS.
AND DAVID AXELROD OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, HE CAME TO HER
DEFENSE AND SAID HE THOUGHT THAT
IT WAS WRONG.
THEN TODAY HE FOLLOWED UP WITH
THIS SWEET, NOT GOOD OR EVEN
EFFECTIVE.
BUT UNLESS AND UNTIL POTUS STOPS
REGULARLY INSULTING OPPONENTS
AND INCITING SUPPORTERS, SANDERS
FOR STABILITY LIKE SHE DID TODAY
FOR STABILITY LIKE SHE DID TODA
TODAY.
YOUR RESPONSE?
>> I LIKE DAVID AXELROD.
HE'S A GOOD GUY AND HE AND I
HAVE ENJOYED A NICE FRIENDSHIP,
BUT I THINK HE'S WRONG ABOUT
THIS.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED.
THIS A PUBLIC BUSINESS AND IT'S
NOT THAT SARAH WAS ASKING FOR
SOMETHING OFF THE MENU OR
SOMETHING UNIQUE.
SHE JUST WANTED TO HAVE A QUIET
DINNER WITH HER FAMILY AND SHE
WAS ASKED TO LEAVE.
FRANKLY IF I WERE RUNNING A
BUSINESS I WOULD WANT TO HAVE
THE PEOPLE I DIDN'T LIKE AND
AGREE WITH.
BECAUSE I WOULD USE THAT MONEY
FOR THINGS THEY DIDN'T LIKE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE BUSINESSES I
HAVE, I WANT EVERY LEVEL TO
SPEND AS MUCH MONEY WITH ME AS
THEY CAN.
I WILL GIVE IT TO CHURCH AND
PRO-LIFE CANDIDATES.
I'M SURE THAT WILL DRIVE THEM
NUTS BUT I WOULD NEVER TURN MY
BUSINESS AWAY BECAUSE THEY
DISAGREE WITH ME.
I THINK WE ARE GETTING
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE IN THIS
COUNTRY WHEN IN THE NAME OF OPEN
EXPRESSION WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP
SOME PEOPLE FROM EVEN BEING ABLE
TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION.
MORE IMPORTANTLY, JUST BEING
ABLE TO GO AND HAVE DINNER, FOR
HEAVEN SAKES.

A CONVERSATION IN THE MIDST OF
THIS.
I'M GOING TO PUT UP THIS TWEET.
WITH A PICTURE OF PEOPLE WHO
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GANG
MEMBERS, YOU TALK ABOUT THE
TAKE BACK OF THE HOUSE.
FOLKS ARE SAYING IT WAS RACIST
AND INSENSITIVE AND YOU ARE
ADDING TO THIS COMBUSTED
CONVERSATION.
>> HOW RIDICULOUS.
FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS SATIRE.
I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND I
REGULARLY POST ON MY TWITTER
HUMOR AND YOU CANNOT HANDLE
SATIRE, PLEASE DON'T FOLLOW ME.
BUT I WANT TO MAKE THIS ABOUT
RACE.
WHAT RACE WAS I TALKING ABOUT?
CRIMINAL GANG?
PEOPLE WHO MURDERED, AND
MUTILATE LITTLE CHILDREN
CHILDREN, THAT'S NOT A RACE OF
PEOPLE.
THAT IS A GANG OF CRIMINALS.
THERE'S NOTHING TO DEFEND AND
I'M AMAZED THAT THERE WERE
PEOPLE OUT THERE DEFENDING MS-13
AND SOMEHOW SAYING THAT WE WERE
NICE ENOUGH TO THEM.
I DON'T WANT TO BE NICE, I WANT
THEM TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS.
I APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT FOR
WANTING TO TREAT THEM OUT THEY
ARE, AS CRIMINALS, AND PEOPLE
WHO ARE PREDATORS FOR LITTLE
