draft has been submitted on behalf of
Arab nations the terrorist group Hamas
bears primary responsibility
the resolution mentioned Israel five
times yet we couldn't win
with yourself we mentioned come out even
one
don't you know those against
final example today's vote is extremely
disappointing but unfortunately not
surprised this session is another missed
opportunity for this council we are
offering a separate resolution the text
as proposed does not reflect a balanced
and impartial approach to the
israeli-palestinian conflict
it is Hamas that has incited violent
acts we regret that the American text
does not adequately references rails
responsibilities and obligations with
regard to Gaza the majority of those
killed by Israeli Defense Forces in
recent weeks were members of the Hamas
terrorist group who is responsible for
gossiping located by air and sea Israel
it is mosque that has attacked the very
humanitarian access point into Gaza
those in favor please raise their hand
you
