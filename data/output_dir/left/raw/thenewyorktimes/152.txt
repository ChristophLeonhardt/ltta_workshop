1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
“All of us who are seeing
these images

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,800
of children being pulled away

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,830
from moms and dads in tears,

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,010
we’re horrified.”

5
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,580
Ted Cruz has proposed
emergency legislation

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,380
to end the Trump administration policy

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,910
of separating families
that cross the border illegally,

8
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,000
a policy facing increasingly
bipartisan criticism.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,610
“This has to stop.”

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,610
This is not the
first time

11
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,439
Cruz and Donald Trump
have found themselves

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,439
at odds with each other.

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,380
“Donald, you’re
a sniveling coward.”

14
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,450
“This guy's a liar.”

15
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,860
There was not much that
Cruz and Trump

16
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,000
left unsaid in the
lead-up to the 2016 election.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,479
“Donald is a bully.”

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,200
“Lyin’ Ted.”

19
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,020
“Lyin’ Ted.”

20
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,420
“Lyin’ Ted Cruz.”

21
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,590
“This man is a
pathological liar.”

22
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,440
“Nobody likes him.”

23
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,520
“Utterly amoral.”

24
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,640
“A little bit of a maniac.”

25
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,440
“Donald, relax.”

26
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,090
“Go ahead, I'm relaxed.

27
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,400
You’re the basket case.”

28
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,330
It all came to a
spectacular showdown

29
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,260
at the Republican
National Convention

30
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,280
when Cruz refused
to endorse Trump.

31
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,610
“Vote your conscience.”

32
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,260
Even as the crowd
turned up the heat.

33
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,920
“Endorse Trump!
Endorse Trump!”

34
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,600
But then,

35
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,190
shortly before
the election,

36
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,730
he did a full 180,

37
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,730
voicing his support
for Trump after all.

38
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,780
Since then, the
epic feud

39
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,660
has been lost
in the annals of history,

40
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,110
as Cruz aligned himself

41
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,000
with the president.

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,510
“This is an
all-star cabinet.

43
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,500
You look at Judge Gorsuch.

44
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,100
And then you look at
the executive action.

45
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,500
Or on the economic side.

46
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,780
I think we’ve seen a lot of strong
substance

47
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,810
in this opening month.”

48
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,300
Fast forward to now.

49
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,840
Cruz’s main rival is
no longer Donald Trump,

50
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,690
but Representative Beto O’Rourke,
a Democrat now gunning

51
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,710
for Cruz’s Senate seat.

52
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,700
O’Rourke is breaking Texas
Democratic fund-raising records

53
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,530
and seeking to ride
a wave anti-Trump furor

54
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,080
all the way to Washington.

55
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,040
“No wall is needed.

56
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,590
The U.S.-Mexico border has
never been safer

57
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,640
than it is today.”

58
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,963
If O’Rourke won in the
November midterms,

59
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:43,530
he would be the first
Democratic senator

60
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,600
from Texas to be elected
in over two decades.

61
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,240
“Texans don’t want to see
a return to the high-tax,

62
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,630
high-regulation, high-spending 
days of Barack Obama."

63
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,660
And while Cruz still
has a significant lead

64
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,920
in the latest polls, the race
has been closer than expected

65
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,780
and Republicans
have taken notice.

66
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,310
So after Cruz extended a
hand into the future

67
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,540
in a radio interview
with Breitbart in April —

68
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,040
— Trump also let go
of any bad blood on his side.

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,800
“Full endorsement for this man.

70
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,670
Ted Cruz. Where’s Ted?”

71
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,195
[crowd cheers]

72
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:22,280
And this is how,

73
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,090
with their eyes
set on the prize,

74
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,370
even two old rivals seem to
have seen the ancient wisdom

75
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,950
in party loyalties and
pragmatic alliances.

76
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,140
What remains to be seen,

77
00:02:32,140 --> 00:00:00,000
is whether their alliance
can survive this latest controversy.
