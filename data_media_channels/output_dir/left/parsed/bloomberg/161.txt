JOE: THE QUESTION IS "WHAT'D YOU
MISS?"
SCARLET: THE FED FACES TO
SEPARATE PATHS.
WE HAVE THE CHART THAT EXPLAINS
THEIR APPROACH.
JOE: HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THE
HOUSING RUN CONTINUE?
MATT: IS CLIMATE CHANGE
MAGNIFYING THE DANGERS FOR
HOUSING.
36 U.S. CITIES COULD BE
COMPLETELY LOST.
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH MARKET
MINUTES.
AND X IS SETTING RECORD HIGHS,
CLOSING NEARLY.
JANET YELLEN MAY OR MAY NOT GIVE
AN INDICATION OF WHAT THE FED
SEES AS THE NEXT RATE MOVE.
JOE: VERY QUIET MARKET AHEAD OF
THAT MEETING.
UTILITIES AND STAPLES LAGGING ON
THE WAY UP TODAY.
MATT: TAKE A LOOK AT THE WINNERS
AND LOSERS FOR THE DAY.
BEST BUY, MASSIVE WINNER.
I BELIEVE IT IS UP $6.43.
SCARLET: UP 20%.
TOLL BROTHERS ALSO GAINING AFTER
BEATING ON EARNINGS.
MONSANTO GAINING ON REPORTS THAT
THE M&A ACTION COULD COME
THROUGH.
I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU MYLAN,
WHICH SHOWS YOU THREE DROPS.
CONGRESS IS GETTING SERIOUS
LOOKING INTO THIS PRICING ISSUE.
THEY HAVE DRASTICALLY BOOSTED
THE PRICE.
NOW IT IS 600 FOR A PAIR.
SCARLET: YOU NEED A PAIR
EVERYWHERE.
MATT: $1200 IS THE LEAST YOU CAN
SPEND IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE
NEW ALLERGIES.
JOE: I HAVE BEEN DEADLY ALLERGIC
TO PEANUTS MY WHOLE LIFE.
LOOKING AT GOVERNMENT BOND
MARKETS, HIGHER YIELDS ACROSS
THE CURVE IN THE U.S.
VERY MINOR HIGH YOUR YIELDS,
VERY QUIET ACTION AND U.S.
TREASURY MARKETS AHEAD OF JANET
YELLEN'S SPEECH ON FRIDAY.
ONE PLACE OR WANT YOU TO KEEP
YOUR EYE ON IS PORTUGAL.
LOOK AT THAT.
3%.
THAT IS PRETTY JUICY.
THERE ARE ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT
A POTENTIAL DOWNGRADE, SO KEEP
AN EYE ON THOSE YIELDS.
SCARLET: A BIG MOVER TODAY WAS
THE SOUTH AFRICA RAND.
THERE IS A LOCAL NEWS REPORT
THAT A POLICE UNIT ORDERED THE
FINANCE MINISTER TO REPORT TO
ITS OFFICES.
THIS REPORT RAISE CONCERNS OF A
RIFT BETWEEN THE FINANCE
MINISTER AND PRESIDENT JACOB
ZUMA.
MATT: WE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT
THIS FOR A WHILE.
SCARLET: GORDON HAVE COMMITTED
THE TREASURY TO SPENDING CAPS
OFF AND DEBT REDUCTION.
JOE: CHECK OUT OIL.
WE KEEP GETTING THESE HEADLINES.
MAYBE THE PRODUCERS WILL STEP IN
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT
OVERPRODUCTION.
PERHAPS SOMETHING WITH IRAN THIS
TIME.
WE ENDED UP JUST OVER 1%.
SCARLET: LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE
INTO THE BLOOMBERG.
I'M LOOKING AT TREASURIES.
WHO WANTS TO GET AHEAD OF JANET
YELLEN SPEECH?
VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE
SPEECH.
THIS IS THE TIGHTEST MONTHLY
TRADING RANGE FOR THE 10 YEAR
SINCE 2006.
IN AUGUST, IT'S AT 16 BASIS
POINTS.
IN JULY, 31 BASIS POINTS.
IN JUNE, 41 BASIS POINTS.
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO JUNE FOR
A SMALLER TRADING RANGE IN 2006.
MATT: 32 CONSECUTIVE DAYS
WITHOUT A BIG SWING.
JOE: IT'S QUIET.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE U.K.
IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE
THAT VOTE.
WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THE
ECONOMY FALL.
SOME DATA IS NOT THAT BAD.
THE BLUE LINE ON THIS CHART IS
THE ECONOMIC SURPRISE INDEX FOR
THE U.K.
THAT COULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE
DATA HOLDING STEADY, BUT DATA
WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
WHY DO MANUFACTURER EXPORT
ORDERS PICK UP?
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WEEK POUND
-- WEAK POUND.
MATT: IT WASN'T AN APOCALYPSE.
AT LEAST NOT YET.
JOE: THERE WILL BE ONE DAY.
MATT: I'M HAVING A LOOK AT
STOCKS.
WHAT IT SHOWS YOU IS THAT U.S.
STOCKS, THE WHITE LINE -- SORRY,
THE BLUE LINE TRACK VERY CLOSELY
GLOBAL TECH STOCKS, THE WHITE
LINE.
THE POINT IS THAT THE PINK LINE,
WHICH IS ALL GLOBAL STOCKS,
DOESN'T TRACK EITHER ONE.
U.S. STOCKS ARE TRACKING TECH
STOCKS BETTER THAN GLOBAL STOCKS
ARE TRACKING TECH STOCKS.
JOE: HERE WITH US TO DISCUSS THE
STOCK MARKET AND TODAY'S ACTION
IS OLIVER RENICK.
OLIVER: I THINK THE CHART IS
PRETTY INTERESTING.
AS THE FIRST TIME I AM SEEING
IT.
THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT
TECH COMPANIES RIGHT NOW.
MATT: THIS CHART COMES FROM
CHARLES SCHWAB POSTED IN THE
BLOG EARLIER.
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.
OLIVER: LOOKING AT TECH STOCKS,
A LOT OF INTERESTING STUFF.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT VALUATIONS, THE
WAITING IN TECH STOCKS,
COMPRISING 21% OF THE BENCHMARK.
THAT NUMBER DOES NOT VACILLATE A
HUGE AMOUNT.
SINCE THE RUN UP, THEY ARE 21%
OF THE INDEX, SO THERE ARE
STARTING TO BE SOME QUESTIONS.
THEY ARE CALLING INTO QUESTION
SOME OF THE EARNINGS AND
VALUATIONS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EARNINGS
BACKDROP, IT IS VERY STRONG.
JOE: ONE OF THE THEMES OF THE
MARKET IS HOW LITTLE VOLATILITY
THERE IS.
ONE CHART WE HAVE HERE, S&P 500
AND IMPLIED CORRELATIONS AT
THEIR LOWEST LEVEL SINCE BREXIT.
>> THIS IS A BLOOMBERG FUNCTION
EVERYONE SHOULD USE.
YOU CAN TRACK THIS.
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO
MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS, THIS IS AS
IMPORTANT AS ANY INDICATOR THAT
THERE IS.
IT HAS NOT GONE BACK UP.
THE PROBLEM IS WHETHER INVESTORS
CAN GO IN AND PICK THE RIGHT
STOCKS.
SCARLET: IT'S A CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES,
NOT ASSET CLASSES?
OLIVER: CORRECT.
JOE: I CHARTED AGAINST THE VIX,
WHEN YOU SEE THE SURGES IN
VOLATILITY, EVERYTHING MOVES
TOGETHER.
ONE VOLATILITY DECLINES, STOCKS
BEHAVE IN THEIR OWN WAYS.
>> STOCKS MIGHT BE MOVING IN
THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS, ARE THE
SECTORS MOVING IN THEIR OWN
SEPARATE WAYS, ARE THE FACTORS
MOVING SEPARATELY?
AT THAT CAN BE A HARDER THING TO
NAVIGATE, ESPECIALLY WITH A
TURNOVER.
SCARLET: YOU SEEN MORE THAN 400
MILLION DOLLARS OF INFLOWS INTO
THE MOMENTUM ETF'S.
IT IS PRETTY SMALL, BUT
EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN
SIGNIFICANT.
>> ONE OF THE BIG STORIES IN THE
EQUITY MARKET IS THE EMERGENCE
OF THIS SMART DATA TYPES TRAGEDY
, PASSIVE AND ACTIVE AT THE SAME
TIME, CAPITALIZING NOT ON A
SECTOR OR STYLE OR FACTOR,
MOMENTUM IS ONE OF THOSE
FACTORS.
WE KNOW WHICH SECTORS HAVE BEEN
DOING WELL, DEFENSIVE,
UTILITIES, CONSUMER STAPLES.
WHAT THOSE FLOWS ARE TELLING YOU
IS THAT THE MOMENTUM STOCKS ARE
THOSE DEFENSIVE TYPE COMPANIES
WITH THE DIVIDENDS.
PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY SEEING GAINS
IN THE SECTORS, BUT PILING MORE
MONEY INTO IT.
SCARLET: SPEAKING OF THE
DIFFERENT SECTORS.
THIS IS THE RELATIVE ROTATION
GRAPH.
 SPEAKING OF THE
DIFFERENT SECTORS.
WITHIN THE LEADING SECTORS,
TECHNOLOGY AT THE TOP, FOLLOWED
BY HEALTH CARE.
MAYBE CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY
MOVING UP, BUT A LOT OF
DEFENSIVE PLAYS.
>> I LIKE THIS FUNCTION.
IT IS THE JACKSON POLLOCK OF
MARKET MOVES.
EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN STORY.
TECH IS A SHIFT TOWARD CYCLICAL
COMPANIES.
SOME OF THESE ECONOMIC ORIENTED
COMPANIES WILL DO BETTER.
AT THE SAME TIME, SPECIFIC
STORIES GOING ON WITH CONSUMER
DISCRETIONARY.
THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW GROUPS
WHERE EARNINGS HAS BEEN DOING
WELL.
AS WE PIVOT BACK TOWARDS
POSITIVE EARNINGS, THAT CAN
PROVIDE LIFT TO THE MARKET.
YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE SECTORS
DO WELL.
>> JOE POINTED THIS OUT TO ME
EARLIER.
YOU MENTIONED PASSIVE INVESTING.
SOMEONE AT BERNSTEIN PUT OUT A
NOTE THAT PASSIVE INVESTMENT IS
WORSE FOR SOCIETY THAN MARXISM.
>> THERE IS A LOT OF VOCAL
DEBATE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
ISSUE, HOW LONG CAN SMART DATA
BE SMART DATA?
-- SMART BETA BE SMART BETA?
>> IF YOU ARE AN ACTIVE MANAGER
WHO HAS TO JUSTIFY YOUR FEES,
THEN PASSIVE INVESTING MIGHT NOT
BE THE BEST THING FOR YOU.
JOE: OLIVER RENICK, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
SCARLET: WE WILL BE BACK WITH
MUCH MORE.

A NUMBER OF DEALS TAKING PLACE
IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY SPACE,
4600 THIS YEAR.
EARLIER TODAY, ALIX STEEL SET
DOWN WITH THE COPRESIDENT AND
TALKED ABOUT THE DEBT MARKET >>
AND TECH VIOLATIONS.
WHAT DRIVES VALUATION ARE THE
CREDIT MARKETS.
WHEN CREDIT MARKETS ARE ROBUST
AND DEBT IS CHEAP, PRICES GO
UP.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT THERE
HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
IN THE BYWAY SHOULD MULTIPLES.
THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR HAS SEEN A
SIGNIFICANT MOVE AND MANY DEALS
ARE PRICED AT LEVELS OF
MULTIPLES OF CASH FLOW THAT ARE
OUT OF WHACK WITH THEIR GROWTH
RATES.
WHEN WE LOOK AT A BUSINESS, WHAT
ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES THAT
MAKE THAT BUSINESS A SUSTAINABLE
GROWER IN ITS INDUSTRY BECAUSE
IT IS THE GROWTH RATE THAT
REALLY PROVIDES THAT STRONG
UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTAL VALUE FOR
A MULTIPLE THAT YOU PAY FOR THAT
COMPANY.
IN CERTAIN SECTORS, THE
MULTIPLES ARE EXCEEDING WHAT THE
MATH WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT THE
INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE COMPANY.
>> IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS,
TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONLY SECTOR
WHERE ANALYSTS HAVE NOT BEEN
CUTTING PROFIT FORECAST.
HOW DOES SOMEONE LIKE YOU MAKE
AND EXIT.
>> OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST
10-15 YEARS, WE HAVE BECOME MUCH
MORE HANDS ON AND BRING A MUCH
MORE INTENSIVE OPERATING
APPROACH TO OUR COMPANIES.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE VALUES
ARE AT THE HIGHER END OF THE
HISTORICAL RANGE IS TO DRIVE
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE
OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR
COMPANIES, AND THAT LEADS TO TWO
THINGS, HIGHER EARNINGS EVEN AT
CONSTANT MULTIPLES OF ALLOWING
YOU TO DRIVE STRONG RATES OF
RETURN IN THAT 20% RANGE THAT WE
IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY INDUSTRY
ARE LOOKING FOR AS A COMPOUND
ANNUAL RETURN ON MONEY WE
INVEST.
AND SECONDLY, HE EVEN HIGHER
MULTIPLES.
THE WORLD IS CYCLICAL.
IF WE EVER THINK THAT SOMEHOW
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND WE
WILL NEVER SEE ANOTHER DOWN
CYCLE AND MULTIPLES, THEN THAT
THE FLIES -- I'VE BEEN DOING
THIS FOR ALMOST 36 YEARS -- IT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.
>> IT HAS BEEN HARD TO OFFLOAD
SOME OF THE.
>> THE DEBT MARKETS ARE ROBUST.
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC
SITUATION.
THE RISK PREMIUM FOR THE SINGLE
B'S SHOT UP, AND NOW THAT
HAS COME DOWN AND THE SPREADS
HAVE NARROWED SIGNIFICANTLY.
THE BASE RATE UPON WHICH THAT
SPREAD IS ADDED IS AT ALL TIME
LOWS.
THE COST OF DEBT IS
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IT WAS
IN 2007, WHICH IS THE LAST TIME
WE SAW SOME OF THE SAME KIND OF
VALUE MULTIPLES AND DEBT
MULTIPLES ON THESE COMPANIES.
>> THAT WAS SCOTT SPERLING WITH
ALIX STEEL.
SCARLET: HILLARY CLINTON LAYS
OUT A PROPOSAL FOR SMALL
BUSINESS OWNERS.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
>> "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
THE NATURAL RATE OF IT, AND WE
WILL TALK ABOUT IT NOW.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT SHOULD
BE 2%.
THE DEFAULT NEUTRAL REAL RATE IS
2%.
THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER AND
ASSUMED GROWING UP AS KIDS.
WE HEAR IT MAY BE DIFFERENT AND
COMING DOWN.
>> DO HAVE A LOT OF
PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT
WHETHER THE FED NEEDS TO RETHINK
ABOUT HOW IT APPROACHES MONETARY
POLICY AND SAYING THE NEUTRAL
RATE IS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED,
BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE
FACT THAT THE FED IS TRYING TO
DETERMINE WHEN TO RAISE INTEREST
RATES NEXT.
WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT AN
INTEREST RATE INCREASE, BUT IT
POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE FED
NEEDS TO LOOK AT LONG-TERM AND
SHORT-TERM ISSUES AND BALANCE
THAT OUT.
JOE: UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, IF YOU
LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
VERSUS WHAT THE FED HAS SAID IS
THE FULL EMPLOYMENT RATE, YOU
CAN SEE IT RIGHT THERE.
>> THIS IS THE NEUTRAL RATE.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE
LONG-RUN NEUTRAL RATE, THE
MEDIAN RATE IS AROUND 4.8.
THE U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE --
SORRY, I'M WRONG.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
JOE: THERE ARE HUGE GAPS BETWEEN
WHAT THE MARKET THINGS MIGHT BE
THE NEUTRAL RATE OF INTEREST ON
THE UNEMPLOYMENT FRONT, IT LOOKS
LIKE WERE CLOSE.
SCARLET: THE OTHER MANDATE IS
INFLATION.
CORE PC IS 1.6% IN JULY.
STANLEY FISCHER'S SAID IT IS

IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, TRENDING

JOE: I LOVE THAT, HAILING

SCARLET: STANLEY FISCHER FOR
COMING UP WITH NEW TERMINOLOGY.
>> FLIRTING WITH NATURAL MADE ME
THINK OF THE NEUTRAL RANGE.
SCARLET: WE WILL DISCUSS HILLARY
CLINTON'S NEW ECONOMIC PROPOSAL
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
>> LET'S GET THE FIRST WORD
NEWS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN LOUISIANA,
WHERE HE GOT A VIEW OF THE
DAMAGE CAUSED BY FLOODING THAT
KILLED 13 PEOPLE AND FORCED
THOUSANDS FROM THEIR HOMES.
>> THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT
PROPERTY DAMAGE.
THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE'S ROOTS.
WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN, IT CAN
SEEM TOO MUCH TO BEAR, BUT YOU
ARE NOT ALONE ON THIS.
EVEN AFTER THE TV CAMERAS LEAVE,
THE COUNTRY WILL CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT YOU AND HELP YOU UNTIL
WE GET FOLKS BACK IN THEIR HOMES
AND LIVES ARE REBUILT.
>> THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS
APPROVED MORE THAN $120 MILLION
IN ASSISTANCE FOR RESIDENTS
AFFECTED ARE THE FLOODING.
AN AMERICAN SOLDIER HAS BEEN
KILLED WHEN THEIR PATROL WAS
STRUCK BY A ROADSIDE BOMB IN
AFGHANISTAN.
SIX AFGHANS SHOULDERS --
SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED.
THIS COMES A DAY AFTER 100
SOLDIERS WERE SENT TO THE AREA.
TIM KAINE IS ACCUSING DONALD
TRUMP OF USING HIS CAMPAIGN TO
MAKE MONEY FOR HIMSELF.
IN DENVER, TIM KAINE POINTED TO

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT
HAS RECEIVED A NEXT EDITION
REQUEST FROM TURKEY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BLAMED THE
COUP ATTEMPT IN JULY ON A MAN
WHO LIVES IN PENNSYLVANIA.
THE MAN HAS DENIED ANY
CONNECTION TO THE COUP PLOT.

JOE: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED
LOUISIANA TODAY, CONFIDENT THE
STATE WILL REBUILD.
ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT
FROM ZILLOW, RISING SEA LEVELS
COULD AFFECT 6% OF THE HOUSING
STOCK.
NATIONWIDE, ALMOST ONE POINT 9
MILLION HOMES -- ONE POINT 9
MILLION HOMES ARE AT RISK OF
BEING UNDERWATER.
JOINING ME NOW IS THE CHIEF
ECONOMIST FROM ZILLOW.
ABSOLUTELY EYE-POPPING NUMBERS.
IS ANYONE PREPARED FOR THE
ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHICAL DAMAGE
THAT RISING SEA LEVELS COULD
HAVE ON THE HOUSING MARKET?
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK WE ARE AT THAT
POINT YET, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT
THE HORIZON IS NOT 100 YEARS
INTO THE FUTURE.
SCARLET: YOU WERE PROJECTING OUT
90 YEARS, BUT WHAT HAVE YOU
FOUND ABOUT THE PACE OF THE
RISING SEA LEVEL OVER THE LAST
5-10 YEARS?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT
SCIENTISTS HAVE RELEASED IN
TERMS OF HOW FAST SEA LEVELS ARE
SLATED TO RISE, IT SEEMS LIKE A
FAIRLY GOOD ESTIMATE.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT 10 YEARS OR
20 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE, SEA
LEVELS WILL PERHAPS ONLY RISE BY
A FOOT, MAYBE TWO FEET IN SOME
AREAS THAT ARE LOWER.
IT IS SUCH A SHORT TIME HORIZON
THERE THAT THE REAL IMPACT WILL
COME IN THE FUTURE.
GIVEN THAT IT IS SUCH A LONG
HORIZON, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
ARE YET PREPARED FOR HOW MUCH
DAMAGE WATER WILL CAUSE TO
COMMUNITIES RIGHT BY THE OCEAN
AND HOW MUCH MONEY WILL BE LOST
IN ALL OF THIS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN
THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE
CONSERVATIVE.
WERE LOOKING AT THE CURRENT
HOUSING STOCK IN THE CURRENT
DOLLAR VALUE.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT CONSTRUCTION
INTO THE FUTURE, WE WILL TILT
MORE HOMES AND MORE EXPENSIVE
HOMES, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE
COAST, AND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE
AFFECTED BY THIS.
>> 100 YEARS IS A LONG TIME
HORIZON.
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT MOTHER
NATURE WILL GIVE US A FEW HINTS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE FLOODING IN LOUISIANA RIGHT
NOW IS A REMINDER THAT GLOBAL
WARMING IS HAPPENING.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS ONE OF
THE SIDE EFFECTS AS TEMPERATURES
ARE RISING.
IN THE FUTURE, WE CAN EXPECT
MORE OF THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.
THERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW
MUCH HAVOC RISING WATER LEVEL
CAN CAUSE IN A COMMUNITY, HOW
MANY HOMES AFFECTED, AND HOW
MANY LIVES AFFECTED.
>> WE SHOW THE TOP FIVE CITIES
WITH PROPERTIES MOST AT RISK.
LOUISIANA FLOODS EASILY.
FOR EXAMPLE, NEW YORK, BOSTON,
MIAMI, FORT LAUDERDALE,
HUNTINGTON BEACH ARE ALL ON
HERE.
THESE ARE POPULOUS AREAS WITH
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES.
YOU DON'T TYPICALLY SEE FLOODS
AFFECTING APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN
NEW YORK CITY.
>> LOUISIANA IS A TOP STATE THAT
WILL BE AFFECTED, BUT OTHER
STATES WILL BE EVEN MORE SO
AFFECTED.
NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA, HAWAII.
IN FLORIDA, ONE OUT OF EIGHT
CITIES WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH
FLOODING, AND 300 CITIES ACROSS
THE U.S. WILL LOSE MORE THAN
HALF OF THEIR HOUSING STOCK TO
RISING SEA LEVELS IN THE FUTURE.
THESE ARE VERY POPULOUS AREAS
THAT WILL BE AFFECTED, THEREFORE
WE WILL ALSO SEE A TRILLION
DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE HERE.
SCARLET: WHAT KIND OF
RAMIFICATIONS WILL THIS HAVE?
FLOOD INSURANCE AS BECOME
SOMETHING MUCH MORE CRITICAL
THAN IT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY.
>> RIGHT.
WE ARE STARTING TO PAY MORE
ATTENTION TO THIS.
IT IS A VERY CONTESTED TOPIC.
ARE WE OVER INSURING, UNDER
INSURING, IS THE COST CAPTURING
THE WHOLE COST OF THE SYSTEM
ITSELF, WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD BE
PAYING MORE AND FLOOD AREAS.
THIS IT MAKES SENSE TO REBUILD
WHERE WE HAVE JUST SEEN
DEVASTATING FLOODS?
ALL THESE THINGS NEED TO BE
ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE.
SCARLET: COMING UP NEXT, THE
STATE OF U.S. HOUSING.
TOLL BROTHERS SAYS IT IS
RECOVERING, BUT NOT WHAT IT WAS
A DECADE AGO.
>> WE ARE NOT IN A BOOM.
WE ARE IN A STRONG, SOLID,
IMPROVING MARKET.
MORTGAGE MONEY IS NOT EASY.
BUILDERS ARE NOT BUILDING TOO
MUCH SPEC INVENTORY.
WE DON'T HAVE BUYERS COMING IN
WHO ARE INVESTORS.
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A STEADY,
SOLID MARKET, BUT DOES NOT
COMPARE TO THE MARKET OF THE MID
TO THOUSANDS.
â™ª
SCARLET: IT IS TIME FOR THE
BLOOMBERG BUSINESS FLASH.
VOLKSWAGEN HAS AGREED TO PAY A
KEY SUPPLIER TO IN DAYS SIX DAYS
STANDOFF THAT HALTED PRODUCTION.
THE AMOUNT IS WELL BELOW $66
MILLION.
THE SUPPLIERS SOUGHT THE MONEY
TO COVER FACTORY ALTERATIONS IN
PREPARATION FOR A IN ORDER THAT
GW CANCELED.
AT&T HAS REACHED A DEAL FOR
ENHANCING SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS
VISITING CUBA.
SPRINT ANNOUNCED A ROAMING
AGREEMENT LAST FALL.
MORE PROBLEMS FOR LOUISIANA,
SUFFERING FROM RECORD FLOODING
AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE OIL
MARKET.
THE STATE MAY SELL $500 MILLION
IN REVENUE ANTICIPATION NOTES,
THE STATE NO LONGER HAS THE
RESERVES TO PAY BILLS.
THAT IS THE BLOOMBERG BUSINESS
FLASH.
JOE: SALES OF NEW U.S. HOMES
JUMPED IN JULY TO THE HIGHEST
LEVEL IN NINE YEARS.
>> PURCHASES IN THE SOUTH WHERE
THE STRONGEST.
JOINING HAS NOW TO DISCUSS THE
STATE OF HOUSING IS BILL MACGRAW
RIDE -- BILL MCBRIDE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
GROWTH OF THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN
HOUSING.
WE WERE TALKING TO TOLL BROTHERS
EARLIER, WHO HAS DONE QUITE
WELL.
HE SAID IT IS NOT A ROOM, BUT A
STRONG RECOVERY MODE.
>> WHO I WOULD SAY WE ARE IN A
SOLID RECOVERY.
THERE IS FURTHER GROWTH AHEAD.
JOE: ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS PEOPLE
MAKE IS THAT ONE REASON TO BE
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS
THAT HOUSING CYCLE HAS A LONG
WAY TO RUN TO MAKE UP FOR LOST
TIME.
IS THAT STILL YOUR VIEW THAT WE
ARE STILL SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER
HOUSED?
>> I THINK WE WILL GET TO
800,000 THIS CYCLE, MAYBE MORE,
ANOTHER 20% TO 30% FROM HERE.
SCARLET: HOW QUICKLY DO WE GET
TO THAT 800,000.
>> I DON'T THINK THEY WILL RAISE
RATES TO QUICKLY, SO IT DOES NOT
MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.
THE GROWTH HAS BEEN SLOW, BUT
STEADY.
TO GET TO THAT 800,000, IT'S NOT
SO MUCH TOLL BROTHERS THAT WE
NEED, BUT THE LOWER INTO HOMES.
THERE WERE SO MANY FORECLOSURES,
THERE WAS NO REASON TO BUILD.
>> DOUG FROM TOLL BROTHERS WAS
TELLING US THE UBER LUXURY
HOUSING MARKET IS FEELING SOME
PAIN.
THE BUILDERS ARE FINALLY
STARTING TO GET THE LAND AND
LABOR NECESSARY TO BUILD LOWER
TIER HOUSING.
>> OR HAS PUSHED TOWARDS THAT.
THEY ARE GETTING MOST OF THEIR
GROWTH AT THE LOWER END OF WHAT
WE CALL NEW HOMES.
>> THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST
HIGHLY VALUED HOMEBUILDERS.
SCARLET: WHAT IS AT RISK OF
CHANGING NEXT, DEMAND OR SUPPLY?
>> DEMAND IS THERE, SO IT HAS TO
BE SUPPLY.
FOR US TO GET TO 800,000, WE
WILL HAVE TO SEE SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE SUPPLY.
JOE: ONE OF THE BIG DISCUSSIONS
IN HOUSING IS THAT THERE IS SO
MUCH INTEREST IN TOP-TIER
CITIES.
THEY ARE SEEING INCREDIBLE
BOOMS, BAY, LOS ANGELES, NEW
YORK.
ARE THERE ARE SIGNS THAT IT IS
SPREADING, GROWTH OUTSIDE THOSE
MARKETS?
>> THE COASTAL AREAS HAVE
STARTED TO RECOVER THE WORST
WHEN WE HAVE DOWNTURNS, THEN IT
SPREADS INLAND.
JOE: WHAT MARKET STRIKE YOU AS
INTERESTING?
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I DO LOOK
AT IT OUR PREVIOUS DISTRESSED
MARKETS, INLAND EMPIRE IN
CALIFORNIA, PHOENIX, NEVADA --
THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO
BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE A LOT OF
FORECLOSURES THERE.
>> WE HAVE A REGIONAL RAKE DOWN
THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL.
THERE HAS BEEN REAL GROWTH IN
THE SOUTH AND WEST.
THE MIDWEST IS NOT DOING AS WELL
AS THOSE TWO REGIONS.
THE NORTHEAST IS BELOW THE ZERO
LEVEL.
>> SOME OF THAT IS PEERED
DEMOGRAPHICS.
>> THIS IS NORMALIZED.
>> I WOULD NOT IT SPECTRUM MUCH
PICK UP IN THE NORTHEAST.
THE SOUTH HAS THE MAJORITY OF
THE LAND, AND SOME IN THE WEST.
ATLANTA HAS MORE LOTS THAN HALF
THE COUNTRY TOGETHER JUST
SITTING THERE.
THERE IS A LOT OF GROWTH
POTENTIAL DOWN THERE.
>> THE FURTHER WEST YOU GET, THE
LESS AFFORDABLE.
>> I'D LIKE HAWAII, SAN
FRANCISCO, SAN DIEGO, PORTLAND.
THESE ARE EXPENSIVE PLACES TO
LIVE.
>> THEY ARE.
SOME OF THE INLAND AREAS ARE NOT
THAT RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE.
COMPARED TO THE SOUTH, THEY ARE.
SCARLET: WE ARE NOT IN A BOOM.
WE ARE JUST IN A STRONG
RECOVERY.
WHAT DO PEOPLE GET WRONG THE
MOST WHEN THEY LOOK AT THIS
HOUSING CYCLE?
>> I THINK THE FIRST THING THEY
GOT WRONG WAS THAT THOUGHT IT
WOULD RECOVER QUICKLY.
I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE HAD
EXPECTED WITH A SLOW STEADY
RECOVERY.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE PEOPLE
ARE GETTING WRONG.
>> THEY MAY HAVE EXPECTED MORE
FOREIGN BUYERS?
>> THERE ARE AREAS OF THE
COUNTRY WITH TREMENDOUS FOREIGN
BUYERS.
CHINESE BUYERS ARE IMPORTANT TO
CALIFORNIA.
JOE: WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BROAD
RANGE OF ECONOMIC INDICATORS, IS
THERE ANYTHING FLASHING YELLOW
IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL ECONOMY?
>> MANUFACTURING, OF COURSE.
>> ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK COULD
TIP US INTO A RECESSION IN THE
NEXT YEAR OR TWO?
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
THERE ARE GOOD EXPLANATIONS OF
WHY CERTAIN SEGMENTS HAVE
STRUGGLED, STRONGER DOLLAR,
LOWER OIL PRICES.
THIS ANYBODY EXPECT OIL TO DROP
ANOTHER $50?
>> WITH THESE CENTRAL BANKS, YOU
NEVER KNOW.
JOE: BILL MCBRIDE, THANK YOU FOR
COMING.
SCARLET: HILLARY CLINTON VOWS TO
MAKE STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS
AS EASY AS SETTING UP A LEMONADE
STAND IN THE FRONT YARD.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
>> THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
PROPOSAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
A NEW STANDARD TEXT ADDICTION
WOULD LOOK TONIGHT -- WOULD
ELIMINATE FORMS.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THE QUESTIONS ARE HOW IS SHE
GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS, MAKING
SMALL TAX CLAIMS EASIER THAN
SETTING UP A LEMONADE STAND, AND
HOW WAS SHE PAY FOR THAT?
>> SHE IS TALKING ABOUT A
STANDARD EDUCTION AKIN TO WHAT
HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR
INDIVIDUALS.
HILLARY CLINTON TRYING TO SET
HERSELF UP AS SOMEONE WHO IS
UNDERSTANDING OF SMALL BUSINESS.
SHE IS TRYING TO CONTRAST
HERSELF WITH DONALD TRUMP AND
RAISE ISSUES SUCH AS HAS HE
STIFFED CONTRACTORS OR
SUBCONTRACTORS.
THERE WOULD NEED TO BE
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO UNDERSTAND
WHO THIS WOULD AFFECT AND WHERE
THE MONEY WILL COME FROM.
THAT IS ALL STILL TO BE
DETERMINED.
SCARLET: THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN
WOULD LOVE TO FOCUS ON THAT
RATHER THAN DEAL WITH THE
CLINTON FOUNDATION.
THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT
HOW THE DONORS MET WITH HER AT
THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
>> HALF OF THE PEOPLE WERE
DONORS TO THE CLINTON
FOUNDATION.
HOW MUCH OF AN ETHICS ISSUE IS
IS GOING TO BE FOR HILLARY
CLINTON?
>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS LONG
PLANNED TO CONTINUE TO HAMMER
AWAY AT THIS ISSUE.
THIS GIVES THEM MORE AMMUNITION
TO DO IT.
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU COULD HEAR
SOME OF THE ADVOCATES SAY THAT
IT PROVES THE OPPOSITE, THAT IT
PROVES HOW WIDELY AND GLOBALLY
THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WAS
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO
GIVE TWO.
IT FEEDS INTO THIS ONGOING
PROBLEM, IS THERE ENOUGH
TRANSPARENCY?
DID PEOPLE REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE
WAS DOING AS SECRETARY OF STATE
AND HOW IT WAS CONNECTED?
IT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO DO IS
PROVE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE
CONTINUING DISCLOSURES.
THERE ARE ANOTHER 15,000 E-MAILS
THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY TURNED
OVER.
JOE: IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A
GOOD MOMENT FOR DONALD TRUMP, IF
ONLY BECAUSE HE IS NOT THE
FOCUS.
WE ARE BACK TO TALKING ABOUT THE
PROBLEMS THAT HILLARY CLINTON
HAS TO DEAL WITH.
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS TO LIKE
THIS.
>> SURE, BUT CERTAINLY THEY DO.
THIS IS A FOCUS ON HER AND
QUESTIONS THAT WOULD CONTINUE
INTO OFFICE IF SHE WERE TO BE
ELECTED, THE FUTURE OF THE
CLINTON FOUNDATION AND WHAT
ABOUT THE DONORS WHO GAVE TO THE
CLINTON FOUNDATION.
>> THE POINT IS THEY ARE BUYING
ACCESS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT,
RIGHT?
85 DONORS GAVE $150 MILLION TO
THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND GOT A
PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH THE
SECRETARY OF STATE.
>> ONE IS THE IDEA OF ACCESS,
AND THE OTHER IS THE IDEA OF
FAVORS.
THE E-MAILS CLEARLY REFLECT THE
