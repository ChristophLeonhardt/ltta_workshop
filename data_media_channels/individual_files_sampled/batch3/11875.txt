welcome to the Stan Collymore show this is the last show of 2017 so we thought we'd bring you some of my favorite highlights enjoy and where better to start them with my favorite Academy Georgie Hadji is a romanian world cup legend who built an academy funded by his own money and took a team from the third division of the romanian league to champions in an eight-year spell here's a quick reminder of his incredible work it's an absolute miracle oh good scale he gave them the chance to dream big yes Oh Georgie tell us about the Academy I've heard a lot about it it's a world-class facility why did you decide to want to start an Academy you could have gone and carried on coaching or become an ambassador or a million things why did you want to have an academy first of all it was my mind road to give to the kids big opportunity to became became his his dream our target is to promote the players to give the players to build the players it's not to compete with them to beat them who you are why we operate in it because we have a good good talent okay all the time I said to the kids in our team first things we have sure is talent and then if you have also personality we can we in this moment we we have 35 players 100 players for national teams we have 35 so 1/3 of the whole project is one in three players comes from your Academy yeah that must make you very very good each age we have three six five players that make you very proud each day I think to build the I hope Romania will the other next generation better than us this is the bigger target for me whilst filming the Stan Collymore show we have caused trouble around the world engaging in different cultures and music my musical highlight has to be Icelandic rapper MC gouty Reykjavik O'Rourke we discovered him when we visited Iceland on a memorable trip to see the Vikings get to their first ever World Cup even performed at the after party with the players and stuff take a look in England we don't typically see flares pyrotechnics and violence at games anymore brings some countries it's part of their football culture the most dangerous moment we encountered us to be our recent trip to Serbia at the eternal derby between parties an and Red Star Belgrade it started off with because the Red Star Wars always for his club and Partizan was military yeah there is always a big reality I'm talking about communism yeah and all kinds of stuff was there and they started then our fans I mean we are definitely war people because we've been in so many wars in our history so you can imagine supporters because when we are without war we have to fight somebody so we choose to fight against each other so the game is just kicked off here at parties and against rich doorbell braids listen to that for an atmosphere and the North Korea is the Red Star Belgrade fans in here are the parties and ultras and it's a dank dark night where the atmosphere is gonna warm up nicely samo mill mill at halftime in the big Darby but the incredible thing is I was pitch side walking around they really don't like each other these two sets of Lance it's incredible I'm told you have heard before the games but it's normal its usual here it was kind of like that you could feel that I mean it must be quite incredible to play out in that in some country in some countries this is heartless around the stadium with Warsaw in some countries that would stop the game would stop and people would say this is crazy but in a smile speaking to a listener it's normal parties at red star some of you will know I'm always on Twitter with my ladies for all predictions and opinions so I get into a lot of haiti debates mental health - is a very personal subject that i care greatly about so early september in english boxer decided to tweet the depression wasn't real so of course many people including myself were on to him straight away but some want to say that depression isn't really is absurd it's estimated that one in six people every single week experienced a mental health issue so this has to be the worst Witter moment of the year for sure in football we're losing some of the traditional aspects of the game that suddenly we simply no longer see there's a disconnect between clubs and fans but whilst on the trip to Iceland I witness the most incredible thing the national team manager high morale Grimson gave the fans the team news two hours before the media truly incredible take a look sweaty you're ready for the game 2-1 we good with that we started to notice here no fun that's what she means 12th man of course yeah so you are the 12th man yeah news media since the very beginning a small population and you cannot stand in the crowd in the stadium unless you can yeah you can read someone someone that know something on fit but we basically just meet up here we sing we have a great time drink a little beer then in about an hour the national coach actually comes five coachable international football team comes before a game what is in the zone is contact to chat with the fans and give them the team absolutely gives us the team shows us the motivational video that he shows to the players and basically two hours before every match he's here getting us ready for the match it's quite an incredible thing to them and it kind of shows the team spirit it's not just the players it's not just the fans it's a whole collaborative effort absolutely it's the whole nation combined into one you know so we're going in the managers just gone in phones off my phone is switched off so five minutes in the information we're going to get the team and nobody tweets Facebook's instagrams a word trust between manager and fan it's quite incredible it takes a lot for me to blush and get nervous I can assure you but when I came into contact with my old manager Martin O'Neill on the eve of Ireland's World Cup playoff against Denmark he's famous quick wait I had a room full of dull journalists in stitches gaffer good to see it first and foremost and although now very well thank you and you are to Russia today where hey arty Russian television Russian yes you taught me a lot actually a very good player Brussels until you broke your leg really good thank you mozzie done hat-trick against some saloon here yeah remember it well Fiona Haskell it's a Celtic mind never mind maybe the next lifetime I am now in the next lifetime I think I'll see that make slave time before you long before you let's take a short break but stay with us on The Stand Collymore show to see more of my favorite moments of the year welcome back to the Stan Collymore show as we continue to look back at my favorite highlights of 2017 it's a common sight to see for all communities come together in the face of tragedy the game for Grenfell was a truly heartwarming day for all involved Joe so Moreno even mr. Manchester United friendly to meet the victims and play his part here's a look at the best bits of the day where stone's throw away from from Grenfell talk is cheap we've done it today we brought them words are easy I like action and I think they feel it today I'm just gonna walk over there later and say hello to all of them they must know the people are prepared to come together raise money in order to help them rebuild their lives fell deeply the tragedy and if I can give a little bit to the people that left us I think I should we conduct a lot of interviews here on the Stan Collymore show but one in particular stood out Michael Owen has a reputation for being fairly dull but his honesty and self-confidence was a refreshing surprise here's a reminder Argentina did you feel that this was something special or did you just treat it like another game at the time I just thought it's another game if you'd asked me to name five players and the Argentine same I wouldn't have been able to do it I just had this what I thought was normal this view going into games and it wasn't intentional I just thought that I never looked at you know is that he left-footed is he slower than the other one I was faster than anything I was gonna score no matter what I didn't even think or they'll be scared to me I just assumed that it's just another game and I always score goals so I will score and just unleash me you know just play me and I'm and you know and I was just a ball of excitement really I had no fear at all I had no idea apart from the we were playing Argentina no idea about their players and he strengths weaknesses and I just went into the game probably as underprepared as anybody in the in the team in terms of knowing who I'm playing against but just there's one thing that the I had as an advantage on anyone I was just fearless and I was just you know totally comfortable and confident in my ability he score a world-class goal on the world class stage but how did Michael Owen view that moment when you pick the ball look when I first touched the ball back and we played the ball to me I was around the halfway line and the I had no idea how deep I all it was or any the picture I just had a defender right next to me about as close as you are and I thought if I can just take it in my in my stride then I'm away from him and then I'll know you know football changes and pickets you know pictures I died every split second so I managed to take a good touch with the outside of my right foot and almost wriggle for free of him and and I looked up I can remember thinking there's only one player to be and look how deep he is and I obviously had a run up on him who's never gonna be able to stop me it's almost like just putting a mannequin in front of you when you're when someone's so deep and they're giving you the chance to get a run on you it was just impossible I couldn't go past him so I just set off obviously running I took it to the side and then I saw scalzi and my my outside on my outside but obviously just got there first and magically passed away am I gonna give it to him at that point I scored and I thought as I've run away I was thinking that was a good goal no this is how I felt was a good goal and I didn't think anything other than it was a good goal and were to one-up now and everyone's jumping on me and I remember lift and I had no idea where anyone was in the stadium I remember being on the halfway line after everyone jumping on me I left him I had everyone jog back into position and punch the air and looked at the crowd and the first person I saw first people I saw with my mum and dad on the halfway line our 30 odd thousand people and I just thought oh my word that's the most surreal moment ever so I'll punch the air and as I jogged back I thought yeah that was actually a brilliant goal my team of the year is a simple choice a nation gripped by Civil War Syria almost qualified for next year's World Cup we traveled halfway around the world to follow an incredibly heartwarming story and I well vitamin yo masala dhaba so DB risotto for sabe who we are just move away that is the kingdom neck in Harlem Magnezone for Simon alley I should not have sorry but have good Sher Shah Suri doesn't hide days before Island met Denmark for that last gasp place at the World Cup I chatted to the Dutchman at the helm of Ireland's Technical Program Roux doctor to discuss his philosophy rude what is the blueprint in the future of Irish football well the blueprint is player development I spoke before the National League so it's important that all the League of iron clubs have academies so they can build their own players and ultimately the growth of the underage structures will provide football a much stronger position and also we have to compete with other sports of course so I think the future is bright in their sense how important is it the Republic of Ireland play against Denmark a World Cup is obviously a huge shell to the population how important at the top level is that they the national men's team the national women's team set the standard for everybody else below massive because what happens on the top has a reflection on the race football of course so when I was a kid you know I remember when the Dutch team and they are in trouble now so you can see what happened immediately so that's for the women's team as well so performance at the top are highly important for me for the young kids to inspire to play football to develop themselves that's why year 4 so we have a responsibility to develop better place for the future that's that's what we're working on and that's a long-term project but you have to be consistent there needs to be continuity and at the end results will come no doubt when we were in Serbia recently my former teammates of our Milosevic and I managed to catch up with our old boss Brian little for the first time in 20 years via the magic of video something of course we didn't have in 1997 are you asleep I've come over to come out with the Belgrade gaffer to do to film around the party's on against red star and they better know better to guide me around the city than this man and he wanted he wanted to say hello to you so glad to see I said to him I said because he hasn't been I was bearing him fried you said he needs to come come over looking forward of course we've had the biggest football stars on the planet on the Stan Collymore show on RT including one of my heroes Gary Lineker but surely the biggest guest has to be the one and only king of football Pele here in first andis World Cup memories was truly inspiring was the Brazil team of 1970 the best football team ever to me was the best team from there that wave for World Cup no Brazil no doubt was one of the best team but to have a nice history you know because whether we was prepared for the World Cup then we have to select the South danga was the coach in a moment then so diamond select you know the the the older the force from Santos from Flamengo Rivelino from Corinthians but the four players Jer so was number ten all the newspaper the party starts a this team does not gonna work because they get Palermo birthing in Santos Rivelino and thinker injures Jason everything if I may ego no they see non-believer to style Norbertine inclusive the everybody started to know this team doesn't go to work this thing because southern is crazy was the best team from the old history of a Brazil World Cup was the best to go fantastically and of course you got the number 10 yeah I was and then no that was my best moment in the world oh my god 70 was the big big responsibility did you feel that responsibility yeah going into the 1970 World Cup the greatest player in the world this pal I feel does he feel nervous I don't know what I feel I can tell you I'd say God you gave all those know Victor's in my life you gave it to me I cannot say goodbye
