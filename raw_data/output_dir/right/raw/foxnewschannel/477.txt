42
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,109

00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:00,446
THERE IS OTHER THINGS THE

46
00:01:00,446 --> 00:01:02,915

INVESTIGATE WHETHER, INDEED,

48
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,553
THERE IS THIS INTENT TO

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE FBI

54
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:14,760
SHOULD INVESTIGATE WHO

55
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,529
LEAKED DR. FORD'S LETTER?

00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:19,064

ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HER

60

THAT THIS IS PART OF A

67
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:34,346
COORDINATED EFFORT, TWO.

68
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:36,248
NOW, IF THEY ARE TRYING TO

69
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:38,217
CAST DOUBTS UPON HIS

70
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,151
JUDGMENT, I ACTUALLY THINK

71
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:40,819
HE SHOWED INSIGHT.

72
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,189
LET'S ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE.

73
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:43,889
ASK DIANNE FEINSTEIN UNDER

74
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:45,090
OATH DID SHE LEAK IT AND

75
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,859
THEN ASK HER A, BY THE WAY,

76
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,695
WE SHOULD ALSO SEEK TO GET

77
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:50,696
THE -- DR. FORD'S THERAPIST

78
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:51,030
RECORDS.

79
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,032
IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT WITH

80
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:53,432
COMPASSION.

81
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:54,233
NOT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.

82
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,434
THERE SHOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO

83
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:56,235
KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING

84
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:57,970
AT WHEN THEY SEE THERAPY

85
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,270
NOTES.

86
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,805
BUT THAT'S ALL SHE HAS

87
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:01,474
OFFERED FOR CORROBORATION.

88
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:02,675
THAT SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKED

89
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:05,044
AT TO SEE IF IT TRULY DOES

90
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:05,444
CORROBORATE.

91
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:06,312
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT HAS

92
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:07,580
BEEN OFFERED BY HER SIDE.

93
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,048
AND THEN LOOK AT THIS

94
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:11,684
PATTERN OF DELAY,

95
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,020
COORDINATION, AND

96
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,022
OBFUSCATION.

97
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:16,822
GRIFF: SENATOR, HOW WILL

98
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:17,790
YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER

99
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,924
SIDE WHO HAVE PLAYED

100
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,726
POLITICS ALL ALONG AS MANY

101
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:21,661
HAVE SUGGESTED, HOW WILL

102
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,729
THAT AFFECT IN ULTIMATE VOTE

103
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:24,597
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH?

104
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:25,098
>> YEAH.

105
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:27,967
I THINK THAT -- I THINK MOST

106
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:28,902
PEOPLE ON THE REPUBLICAN

107
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:30,970
SIDE SEE IT FOR WHAT IT'S

108
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,271
WORTH.

109
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:32,672
IT IS A PATTERN OF LEAKS,

110
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,108
SET TO DELAY AND TO

111
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:35,909
CHARACTER ASSASSINATE.

112
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:36,876
THINGS BEING RELEASED THAT

113
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:37,911
SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED

114
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:38,645
BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUPPORT

115
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:39,446
FOR THEM.

116
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,414
BUT, BECAUSE IT'S RELEASED.

117
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:44,050
IT FEEDS INTO THE DELAY.

118
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,020
>> I JUST WANT TO PRESSURE

119
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,254
YOU A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

120
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:50,156
WHAT YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR

121
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:51,324
LINDSEY GRAHAM DID WAS TO

122
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,159
TRULY REACH ACROSS PARTISAN

123
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,494
ISLES, IF YOU WILL, TO SAY

124
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:56,362
LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING.

125
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,231
WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS, IF

126
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,132
THIS INVESTIGATION DOES

127
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,066
PROVE THAT THE POLITICS ARE

128
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:00,867
BEING PLAYED ON THE

129
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:02,335
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, SHOULD WE

130
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:04,204
THEN SEE SOMETHING OUT OF

131
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:04,504
THEM?

132
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:05,705
>> YEAH, HOPEFULLY.

133
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:06,039
I HOPE.

134
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,941
I HOPE TRUTH IS MORE

135
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:10,076
IMPORTANT THAN CHARACTER

136
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:10,510
ASSASSINATION.

137
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:10,944
AN IDEOLOGY.

138
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,212
IT WON'T BE FOR SOME.

139
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:14,447
FOR SOME OTHERS, I HOPE THAT

140
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:14,981
IT WILL BE.

141
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,683
AND WE SHOULD NOT SET A

142
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,551
STANDARD THAT YOU CAN DO

143
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,552
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION,

144
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:21,488
KIND OF A COORDINATED

145
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:22,722
PATTERN OF IT TO BRING

146
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:23,690
SOMEBODY DOWN THAT IS A

147
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,557
DANGEROUS PLACE FOR OUR

148
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:25,625
SOCIETY TO MOVE INTO.

149
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,529
KIND OF LIKE THE BOOK 1984.

150
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:30,530
GRIFF: SENATOR BILL CASSIDY,

151
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,531
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

152
00:03:31,531 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME.
