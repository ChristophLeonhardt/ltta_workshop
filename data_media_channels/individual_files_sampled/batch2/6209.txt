from their parents at the border as family seek refuge here in the United States Ivanka Trump thought it would be a good idea to tweet out a picture of herself holding her son and she did get a little bit of backlash for this photo now that's her two-year-old son Theodore it's a very sweet photo but when you put it in the context of what's happening to migrant families here in the United States and how children are being detained by the federal government you can understand why so many people were outraged at that photo it showed a complete disconnect to the pain and suffering that a lot of individuals are facing right now so just to give you some more background on that recently Jeff Sessions the Attorney General and the Trump administration said the following if you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law now again let me just emphasize that there is no law indicating that children need to be separated from their parents as they seek refuge here in the US but nonetheless this is a trump era policy that is being followed by Border Patrol children are being taken away from their families and they are being detained here in the US now in response to Ivanka Trump's photo and tweet there was criticism including this one tweet from Patton Oswalt that said the following isn't it just the best to snuggle your little one knowing exactly where they are safe in your arms it's the best the best right Ivanka Wright and joy Reid also had some criticism for her saying you'd almost never know her father's administration to which she's an advisor was brutally separating migrant children from their asylum seeking parents okay so Ivanka Trump did respond to the trolls by well respond sorry they're not trolls responded to the critics by calling them trolls she's focus on what is before you and what you can control and ignore the trolls have a great week so look I was actually a little bit torn on the Ivanko story until she did that response because look she put out a picture of her and her kid and probably didn't see this coming at all right and she's like wait that's my kid and was just trying to put out a pleasant picture and then all of a sudden I got a 2x4 over my head about immigration policy so why did the herd tweet put me back in the other camp focus on what is before you and on what you can control but wait you're part of the Trump administration and you keep bragging about how you're a moderating influence and so where's the moderation where's the influence so you could say hey Dad look at this isn't this great this is your grandkid and I'm having a lovely moment maybe we shouldn't separate these kind of kids from their parents when they cross the border here I'll be a moderating influence so you actually can control that you're choosing not to so that's why her response made me think okay well Matt now you got to come you can't position yourself as someone who is part of the Trump administration who is trying to empower women when you are complicit in the Trump administration ripping children away from mothers as they come to the US seeking refuge there is a ton of crime in some of these Central American countries they're not coming here and leaving everything they've known to cause problems they're trying to run away from the violence in their own countries which by the way is perpetuated by US policy anyway it's just it's look I agree with you and that she probably didn't see it coming I would be very hesitant to share photos of my children in my family if I were part of any administration because there are a lot of scary people out there I'm just keeping it real but at the same time she's she needs to be aware of what's really happening under her father's leadership and if she is aware she can't go around talking about how she's like this empowering figure for women yeah that's the hypocrisy that bothers me because it's a lovely with her kid bless their hearts but that doesn't but then if you say it I don't care about it other moms with their kids and that's actually the law that my dad passed and I am enabling to rip them apart so they can't have lovely pictures like this well that's the issue and and then she quoted Marcus Aurelius which really bothered me cuz it's one of my favorite thinkers he said if thou were cursed at what is before the following the right reason seriously vigorously calmly without anything allowing anything to distract Z if thou holdest accept nothing fearing nothing but said as my would by President activity according to nature that wilt live happy now first of all look Ivanko we get it you live happy hey you've got a lot of money by hook or by crook look at the delete latest Chinese deal you made okay and but that's not the issue we're like she makes it like sound like I will not allow you to impinge upon my happiness people's happiness I actually think it's worse than that because she again is positioning herself as someone who's doing incredibly important work and she believes in that work and she will fight back against the naysayers and make you know all of these lofty goals come to fruition that's the way that it read to me and it's insulting because what have you done to help benefit the American people you've done quite a bit to benefit yourself and your businesses especially with those deals that you just made in China the trademarking deals that you just made in China but other than that what have you done you have not been a mitigating factor within the Trump administration you have done nothing but sit there and remain complicit as Trump you know passes policy after policy executive action after executive action that does nothing but hurt the very people that you claim you're trying to help and finally she forgot Marcos aliases other favorite quote if thou ignores legitimate points made about thine hypocrisy thine will not have to worry about those pretty little mind I sure Marcus earliest said that exactly anyway in the postgame I'll tell you guys how Marcus Aurelius affected my life and my kids ooh interesting TYT calm /join
