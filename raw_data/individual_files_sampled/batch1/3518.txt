what we have here is the chicken chili verde burrito when you go to lunch when you go to buy lunch on a day at work you're gonna spend upwards of ten dollars okay at Trader Joe's you can walk in get a pack of these burritos two of these burritos for three dollars put some hot sauce on it have a glass of milk and that's a full meal for three dollars I mean the savings are insane and I'm telling you I I love the taste I always feel good after I eat it I feel energized when it's chicken chili verde burrito day I'm in a pretty good mood okay so here is spanakopita do you see how much food this is for less than four dollars any excuse that I can eat cheese and bread and pretend it's healthy there's spinach in here spinach is so good for you it's all things that you've heard of on here oh there's some leek in here olive oil parsley yeah there's no like unidentifiable weird processed things in terms of like frozen meals I'm saving a whole lot of time and I'm getting a meal that's probably as good as what I could cook because I am a horrible cook real mushrooms so it's not some cheap marketing trick where it's just mushroom flavor and it's pretty filling because it's pasta you know high in carbohydrates and I don't need I don't need a whole lot of pasta to get fill and this is like actual pasta it's like actual like like a big pasta not like some fake frozen food pasta I like Indian food for the most part and this is an easy thing that I have to put in the oven it's a really good deal to get like three dollars but I generally go through flip inner cuz it's a safe bet I guess like frozen meat you don't know how well it's going to turn out most days I like them because they're quick dinner they taste good and they're really something that you can really add almost any sauce to and it makes it a different meal so if you had soy sauce its Asian yet pesto it's Italian and it's really good and also it's like one of those dishes where if you make the full box you'll have leftovers and you can oh take that like on a salad and you repurposed for a second day so I like them because they're really easy to make I pan fry them they taste I would say pretty close to restaurant quality and sometimes I have them for a snack but then you can also put them like on a bed of like shredded cabbage which I also get at Trader Joe's and make more of a meal out of it if I make it for me and my husband as like a dinner like a you know on a Friday night or something then I can just make two meals so two meals at 370 whatever it is plus you know a bag of shredded cabbage and carrots that's like five dollars for two people to eat a full dinner which is ideal
