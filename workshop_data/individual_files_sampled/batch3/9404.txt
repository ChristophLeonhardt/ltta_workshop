WORST OF THE WORST. SIT DOWN, BUCKLE UP, IT'S TIME FOR TONIGHT'S BREAKING NEWS SINGAPORE OPENING MONOLOGUE. IT'S 9:00 A.M. AND SINGAPORE AT 9:00 P.M. IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL. IN LESS THAN 20 BARS, THE DOJ'S WATCHDOG IS SCHEDULED TO RELEASE THIS ALL-IMPORTANT IG REPORT. 18 MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN WAITING. AS WE SPEAK, WE HAVE A TEAM OF EXPERTS LINED UP THAT WILL BE ANALYZING THE 500-PLUS PAGES IN THE REPORT LINE BY LINE, AND WE WILL BREAK IT ALL DOWN I PROMISE, AS SOON AS WE GET IT. TONIGHT, PRESSURE FROM ROD ROSENSTEIN AND OTHER OBSTRUCTIONIST BUREAUCRATS IN THE DOJ. THIS IMPENDING REPORT SHOULD SHED A CRITICAL LIGHT ON WHAT WERE THE CRIMES OF HILLARY CLINTON AND HOW THE FBI, DOJ, HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION COMPLETELY AND INTENTIONALLY FIXED, BOTCHED THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. OF COURSE, THE CONTENTS OF THE REPORT COULD BE TOTALLY RUINED BY ROD ROSENSTEIN AND HIS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. REMEMBER, THIS REPORT COULD BE VERY EMBARRASSING FOR ALL OF THEM. TONIGHT WE ARE ASKING THE QUESTIONS. WILL THEY REPORT INCLUDE MASSIVE REDACTIONS? WAS THE REPORT ALTERED BY THE UPPER ECHELON OF THE DOJ? WERE MICHAEL HOROWITZ'S FINDINGS TWISTED, PARSED, OR ALTERED IN ANY WAY? WE WILL HAVE A FULL REPORT TOMORROW. THE FACTS AREN'T IN DISPUTE. LOOK AT THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN. HILLARY CLINTON, WE KNOW, FACT, IRREFUTABLE VIOLATED 18 USC 793, ESPIONAGE ACT. SHE MISHANDLED, DESTROYED CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMMING INFORMATION. IT'S A FACT. SHE DELETED 33,000 SUBPOENAED EMAILS. 18 USC 2071. SHE ACID WASHED FOR HARD DRIVE WITH BLEACH BIT. THAT'S A FACT. SHE DESTROYED LITERALLY, HAD AIDS DESTROY, OR MOBILE DEVICES WITH A HAMMER. THAT'S A FACT. A YEAR IN PRISON FOR SIX PICTURES OF A SUBMARINE. WE KNOW THAT COMEY AND PETER STRZOK, THEY STARTED WRITING THE EXONERATION OF HILLARY IN EARLY MAY OF 2016 BUT THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW HER AND 17 OTHER WITNESSES UNTIL EARLY JULY AND THREE DAYS LATER, THEY EXONERATED HER. WE KNOW THEY PULLED OUT THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND PULLED OUT BEFORE AND INTEL AGENCIES LIKELY HACKED INTO THE SERVER. THAT'S A FACT. DEVELOPING STORY WE'VE GOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT. DEPUTY AG, THERE YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN, ROD ROSENSTEIN. ACCORDING TO REPORTING FROM CATHERINE HERRIDGE, THE DEPUTY AG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACTUALLY THREATENED TO SUBPOENA THE EMAILS AND OTHER RECORDS OF SEVERAL REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR STAFFS. AND AFTER LOSING HIS TEMPER WHICH ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE SOURCES I KNOW, HE FREQUENTLY DOES, HE LAUNCHED INTO WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS A PERSONAL ATTACK AGAINST A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER. THIS ALL CAME AFTER THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE RAMPED UP ITS OVERSIGHT EFFORTS SURROUNDING MULTIPLE DOJ LED TO INVESTIGATIONS IN JANUARY. IN OTHER WORDS, LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR. ROD ROSENSTEIN WAS TRYING TO BULLY, INTIMIDATE, THREATEN HOUSE REPUBLICAN, HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND THEIR MEMBERS FROM FOLLOWING AND DOING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF OVERSIGHT. WE HAVE IN THE SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY CHECKS AND BALANCES, SEPARATION OF POWERS. IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. BY THE WAY, YOU SHOULD AND I WILL CALL IT PROPER HASSLE THAT ANYBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD EVER USE THEIR POWER OR THREATEN TO USE THEIR POWER IS AMERICA'S DEFECT OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TO LITERALLY INTIMIDATE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. FORMER CHIEF ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY AFTER McCARTNEY SUMMED IT UP, "ROD ROSENSTEIN'S SUBPOENA THREAT, HE'S CONFLICTED AND HE'S ACTING LIKE IT." HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR ALAN WATCH THIS. THIS IS A CLASSIC DISPUTE BETWEEN SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER OBVIOUSLY TO OVERSEE AN INVESTIGATION, INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, WHAT ROD ROSENSTEIN IS, SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BULLY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. HE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT. HE SHOULD TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS. HE SHOULD BE COOPERATIVE AND CONGRESS SHOULD BE OPERATIVE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. Sean: PROFESSOR DERSHOWITZ IS 1000% RATE. JONATHAN TURLEY. HE'S ALSO SLAMMING ROD ROSENSTEIN. TAKE A LOOK. I THINK THE THREAT, FOR A CIVIL SUBPOENA, WAS RECKLESS. HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. HE IS SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE COMMITTEES. THESE COMMITTEES HAVE A HISTORY OF RATHER POOR OVERSIGHT. FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE ARGUED FOR YEARS THAT THESE COMMITTEES NEED TO EXERCISE REAL OVERSIGHT, DEMAND DOCUMENTS ARE NOT BACK DOWN, THIS IS A REFRESHING TREND. THE ALLEGATIONS THAT ONE PARTY USED THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THE OPPOSING PARTY, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS FOR OVERSIGHT IN OUR SYSTEM. IT GOES TO THE VERY HEART OF OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND OUR GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM. THERE IS EVERY REASON FOR THE MEMBERS TO WANT TO SEE THESE DOCUMENTS. Sean: SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THEY ARE ALSO FIRING BACK. CONGRESSMAN GOWDY AND MEADOWS REVEALED THE RESOLUTION CALLING OUT ROD ROSENSTEIN FOR HIS THREATS TO SUBPOENA. OF COURSE IT ALL COMES IN THE SHADOW OF THE RAMPANT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE THAT WE KNOW HAS BEEN GOING ON WITH THE DOJ NOT WILLING TO HAND OVER DOCUMENTS. INCLUDING SPECIFIC OHIO'S FROM THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES OVER DOCUMENTS SURROUNDING THE FBI'S USE OF INFORMANTS IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. NUNES SET A DEADLINE FOR YESTERDAY. THE DOJ IGNORED IT. ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? WHY ARE YOU OBSTRUCTING, INTIMIDATING, THREATENING, HARASSING CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFF? IT IS TIME FOR ROD ROSENSTEIN TO STEP ASIDE OR BE FIRED BECAUSE IF THIS IS AN ATTEMPT AT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, WHY WON'T YOU LET CONGRESS DO THEIR JOB? ACCORDING TO NEW POLITICAL POLL NUMBERS, MUELLER'S PUBLIC IMAGE, ROD ROSENSTEIN APPOINTED MUELLER, AT AN ALL-TIME LOW. PEOPLE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND. EAP REPORTING MUELLER STEAM IS "WORRIED THAT RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL USE A CRIMINAL CASE IN WASHINGTON TO GATHER ABOUT ITS INVESTIGATION AND U.S. INTELLIGENCE GATHERING METHODS." WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT. THEY NEVER SHOULD'VE FILED THOSE TONIGHT, I HOPE YOU CAN STOMACH THIS. YOU ARE MAINSTREAM, CORRUPT MEDIA, THE DESTROY TRUMP MEDIA HAS REACHED A NEW LOW. DESPITE SO MUCH SUCCESS AT HOME ON THE ECONOMY AND ABROAD, NOT INCLUDING THIS WEEK HERE IN SINGAPORE, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY PORTRAYED NEGATIVELY IN THE PRESS. EARLIER TODAY, THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING BACK. HE TWEETED: "SO FUNNY TO WATCH THE FAKE NEWS, ESPECIALLY NBC AND CNN. THEY ARE FIGHTING HARD TO DOWNPLAY THE DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA. 500 DAYS AGO THEY WOULD HAVE "BEGGED" FOR THIS DEAL. LOOKED LIKE WAR WOULD BREAK OUT. OUR COUNTRY'S BIGGEST ENEMY IS THE FAKE NEWS SO EASILY PROMULGATED BY FOOLS!" NOW THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT, AND HERE'S ALL THE PROOF YOU WILL EVER NEED. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP. THEY CALL THEMSELVES NEWSPEOPLE. IT'S PATHETIC. A BUNCH OF LAZY, OVERPAID SO-CALLED COLLEAGUES, AND THEY HAVE A RADICAL LEFT-WING AGENDA. IT'S OBVIOUS. TAKE A LOOK. USUALLY WHEN TRUMP SIGNS AN AGREEMENT WITH A FOREIGNER, IT'S A PRENUP. ALMOST CAVEMAN LIKE. IT REALLY IS. COUNTRY. WRITING THINGS ON STONE, NOT EVEN ABLE TO DO THAT. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID KIM JONG UN IS ABSOLUTELY INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE. YEAH. UNLESS OF COURSE KIM JONG UN WINS THE SUPER BOWL OR THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP. WHY THE PRAISES? WE ALL TALK ABOUT A CASE LIKE THAT, THE LANGUAGE. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THE WAY HE TALKS. THIS GUY IS A KILLER. A LOT OF THE REASON WE WERE ON THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR, TO BE SURE, THE NEW NUCLEAR TESTS AND THE RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC FROM DONALD TRUMP RATCHETING UP TENSIONS. THIS IS THE ARSONIST GETTING CREDIT FOR PUTTING OUT THE FIRE. TO BELIEVE KIM JONG UN IS GOING TO GIVE AWAY HIS NUCLEAR ARSENAL WHICH REALLY GIVES THE POWER, I THINK WE WENT TOO FAR. JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S HISTORIC. THAT'S ONE THING. I THINK WHEN YOU CALL SOMETHING HISTORIC, IT MEANS IT HAS A GOOD CHANCE OF HAVING LASTING IMPLICATIONS. I THINK IT'S VERY UNCLEAR, AT LEAST TO MY LAYMAN'S EYE, THAT THIS DOES THAT. ANY PREVIOUS PRESIDENT COULD HAVE EASILY HAD A SUMMIT WITH ANY PREVIOUS LEADER WITH NORTH KOREA BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN VERY EAGER TO BE LEGITIMATED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP IS THE FIRST ONE TO AGREE TO DO THAT. Sean: MEANWHILE, OVER AT MSNBC, THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS CHOICE AND CABLE NEWS, YOU HAVE LIBERAL MORNING HOST, JOE SCARBOROUGH, TRASHING REPUBLICANS WHO SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF. SHOCKING. TAKE A LOOK. IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAVE DEVOLVED INTO A TRUMPIST CULT. IT IS A CULT OF PERSONALITY. THAT'S A GOOD DESCRIPTION. Sean: THE ONLY CULT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH THAT RIDICULOUS MORNING SHOW OF YOURS. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL HIS AGENDA BECOMES OR HOW MUCH THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN, BECOMES. THE MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY IS BLINDED BY PATHOLOGICAL HATRED OF THIS PRESIDENT, SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S NOW OUTWEIGHING THEIR DESIRE EVEN FOR A ROBUST ECONOMY AND PEACE IN THE WORLD. THIS IS SICK. THE RESIDENT IS ACTIVELY,
