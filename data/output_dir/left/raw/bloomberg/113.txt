1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:05,110
When your name is Donald Trump Jr. it is pretty
hard to escape your father’s shadow.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,790
I’d introduce myself as just Don.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,820
Avoid the last name at all costs.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,380
I didn't want to have to deal with everyone making those assumptions

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,680
It wasn't until his father's presidential
campaign that he emerged as a full-throated

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,180
Trump.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,600
You can't give a Trump a mic and not expect us to take our turn

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Donald Trump Jr. is very similar to his Dad.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,200
That's Kevin Cirilli, chief Washington correspondent for Bloomberg television

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Both are ambitious, driven, and not afraid to pick a fight, even if it will lead to controversy, and scandal

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,000
She deserves everything that's coming to her

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,719
And now the spotlight has turned on Donald
Trump Jr – as his meeting with a Russian

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,839
who promised damaging information about his
father's political rival, Hillary Clinton,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,080
raises serious questions.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,340
If a foreign government offers to aid your campaign the answer is no.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,580
I think anyone even a rookie would realize that was inappropriate

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,399
This is how Donald Trump Jr. went from prodigal
son to company man to political lightning

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,360
rod.

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,920
Donald Trump Jr. was born on New Year’s
Eve 1977 to then real estate mogul Donald

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,180
Trump and his wife Ivana, a former model and
skiing prodigy from Czechoslovakia.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,140
Donny, as he was then called, grew up in Trump
Tower’s 53 room penthouse –surrounded

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,020
by nannies and bodyguards.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,710
Donald Trump Sr. has said that he was going
to be a much more engaged father with his

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,700
children when they were adults.

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,520
Don Jr. spent summers with his grandfather
Milos in Czechoslovakia learning hunting and

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
fishing.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,729
There he developed a love for the outdoors
that would follow him throughout his life.

28
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,850
At the age of 12, his parents had a very messy
public divorce.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,509
Blaming his father, Don Jr. did not speak
to him for over a year.

30
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,319
To insulate him from unwanted attention, Ivana
sent Don Jr. off to boarding school.

31
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,030
While refusing to attend his father’s wedding
to Marla Maples, Don Jr. still labored on

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,829
his father’s construction sites for minimum
wage and attended his alma mater- The University

33
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,799
of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School – earning
a degree in finance and real estate.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,729
After college he took some time for
himself.

35
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,060
He went to Colorado.

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,680
He worked at a ski resort.

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,010
And he was someone who didn’t immediately
go into the family business.

38
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,730
In 2001, Donald Trump Jr. changed his tune.

39
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,510
He reported for work at the Trump Organization
in the same building he grew up.

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,500
Don Jr. eventually rose to Executive Vice
President – joining his father in the real

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,380
boardroom – and the fictional one - appearing
alongside him on The Apprentice.

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,360
Who would you rather see continue on with you?

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,740
oof, Don Jr.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,240
That's a very good question.

45
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:39,000
I am officially running for President of the United States

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,010
Along with his siblings Ivanka and Eric, Donald
Trump Jr was a key part of the campaign from

47
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,010
day one.

48
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,299
If Hillary Clinton were elected, she’d be
the first President who couldn’t pass a

49
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,439
basic background check.

50
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:01,320
Unlike Jared Kushner, Ivanka and even Trump himself,
Don Jr’s ideologies align a lot more with

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
the conservative base.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
That’s Shannon Pettypiece,

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,180
I’m a White House reporter with Bloomberg
News.

54
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,590
He is incredibly popular with the
Trump base.

55
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,380
He speaks their language.

56
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,840
He’s a big sportsman, gun advocate…

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,020
Which has landed him in hot water at times.

58
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,900
The Trump sons became targets themselves earlier this year after photographs of their big game kill surfaced online

59
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Just like his father…

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,280
He’s not a politician.

61
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,920
He’s not politically correct and he’s
gotten criticism for it.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,549
And he is pugnacious on social media.

63
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,860
He’s said things that are considered insensitive…Comparing
Syrian refugees to poisonous Skittles…

64
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,670
He does not appear to think the rules apply
to him.

65
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:55,420
You can look at his father as defying the
typical rules, and that's sort of the culture

66
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,069
around the campaign, then you could see how
he was fitting right into it.

67
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,130
After the election, Don Jr., along with brother
Eric, were put in charge of running the Trump

68
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,130
Organization.

69
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,879
We used to joke we are going to get him elected
so we can get some peace and quiet because

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,879
he is a tough boss.

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,120
He has not stayed out of
politics and just been focused on real estate.

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
He’s a very effective fundraiser.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,100
And the assumption is that he was, and maybe
will still, continue being very involved in

74
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
the RNC.

75
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,510
As the accusations mount, Donald Trump has
come out in support of his son.

76
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,420
In his own way.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,600
My son is a wonderful young man. Great young man and fine person. And I think it's a meeting that most people in politics would've taken.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,070
If Donald Trump Jr. can somehow weather the
growing legal storm with his reputation intact…

79
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,390
If anyone from the family was going
to have a political future, it seems like

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,540
Don Jr. would be a real natural for having
his own political career.

81
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,820
Which would likely prove to be a wild ride.

82
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,020
Donald Trump Jr…he’s authentic.

83
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,200
The public may not agree with it, but you
know if you ask Donald Trump Jr. a question

84
00:04:57,200 --> 00:00:00,000
you're going to get what he thinks.
