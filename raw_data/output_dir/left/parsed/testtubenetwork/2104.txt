Luneburg, Germany
Ex-Nazi, Oskar Gr√∂ning, is convicted for
his involvement in the murder of 300,000 people.
The 94-year-old former Auschwitz bookkeeper
was sentenced to four years in prison.
In 2011, a German court set a legal precedent
that ex-Nazis could be prosecuted for war
crimes.
Now, former SS men can be held accountable
for mass murders without specific evidence.
German war crime prosecutors are investigating
30 other cases as a final push for justice.
But the advancing age of ex-Nazis has raised
debate over the necessity of prosecution.
