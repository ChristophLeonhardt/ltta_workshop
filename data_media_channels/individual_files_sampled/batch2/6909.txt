the Supreme Court in Ohio has decided to uphold a state order that essentially led to the shutdown of the one and only abortion clinic left in the state now in a 5-2 ruling the High Court upheld a state order shuttering capital care of Toledo the Northwest Ohio city's last abortion clinic in a decision the facility is expected to appeal so this case could make it to the Supreme Court I don't know how well it would do in the Supreme Court considering our latest Supreme Court justice but in this particular case in the state of Ohio justices say that the clinic violated a requirement because it no longer had a valid patient transfer agreement this is something that we've seen in a lot of red states where Republican lawmakers will pass laws that essentially force these abortion clinics to have hospital admitting privileges and if you're in a red state oftentimes the hospitals themselves happen to be a little conservative so they won't grant those contracts to the abortion clinics now this is all done on purpose to shut down the clinic's let's keep it real the restrictions mandated that clinics long required transfer agreements be with local hospitals and also barred public hospitals from providing them so not only did the clinic have to have the hospital admitting privileges they had to have the hospital admitting privileges under very strict and specific circumstances to give you more information after the republican-controlled state legislature opted to outlaw transfer agreements with public hospitals Capitol care went out of state negotiating its required agreement with the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor after they had done that though legislators responded by passing a new law this one setting a mileage limit on emergency care that Ann Arbor at 52 miles away was too far to meet sue that last part is really important because that goes to show you that them saying no I just wanted to be safe and and healthy is a total lie what does that have to do with a weird mileage limit on how far the hospital is no you pass that because you wanted to make sure that every single clinic in Ohio was shut down this is a way of circumventing the law the law is you're allowed to have an abortion in this country well Republicans don't like that law as usual they're against the rule of law so they pass other pieces of legislation circumventing what is considered the law of the land and and doing something that the Supreme Court has cool ruled very clearly is unconstitutional for the guys claiming to care about the Constitution the rule of law there they go again making sure that they circumvented look the only thing I'll give them credit for is they fight the Democrats almost never fight for their constituents and the Republicans will do everything and anything to make sure that they win on an issue even if it is crystal clear that what they're doing is in circumvention of the law and the Constitution well based on the Supreme Court ruling back in the 1970s regarding abortion there shouldn't be any undue burden when it comes to obtaining an abortion and if you don't have an abortion clinic in the state of Ohio because of the fact that they've made these ridiculous arbitrary laws that make no sense well then it leads to an undue burden so we'll see how this plays out there's no question they're doing it on purpose this is one way to prevent it stop voting for Republicans if you're pro-choice if you're pro-life yeah okay I get it why you're animated by them but if you're a pro-choice like two-thirds of the country well this is what Republicans are gonna do and they're gonna try to take your rights away they do it every time and this is Kasich he's supposed to be the moderate Republican does that look moderate to you what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm slash join
