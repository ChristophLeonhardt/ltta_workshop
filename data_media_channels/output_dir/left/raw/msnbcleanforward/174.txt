00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:12,388
DID NOT ENGAGE IN SOME THINGS THAT WE WOULD FIND AWFUL DURING

167
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:16,425
THAT WE WOULD FIND AWFUL DURING THE PAST 15, 20 YEARS.

168
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:18,360
THE PAST 15, 20 YEARS. BUT I KNOW THAT URCHDNDER THE

169
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:20,995
BUT I KNOW THAT URCHDNDER THE PREVIOUS HEADS OF THE SERVICES,

170
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:23,165
PREVIOUS HEADS OF THE SERVICES, SUCH AS THE FORMER CROWN PRINCE,

171
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,768
SUCH AS THE FORMER CROWN PRINCE, WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH HIM, I

172
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:26,736
WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH HIM, I WOULD NEVER EXPECT SOMETHING

173
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,137
WOULD NEVER EXPECT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO TAKE PLACE UNDER

174
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:28,570
LIKE THIS TO TAKE PLACE UNDER HIS WATCH.

175
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:29,971
HIS WATCH. >> DO YOU THINK THIS IS A

176
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,073
>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS A SCREW-UP OR THIS IS INTENTIONAL?

177
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:32,141
SCREW-UP OR THIS IS INTENTIONAL? >> I THINK IT’S BOTH.

178
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,842
>> I THINK IT’S BOTH. I THINK IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL

179
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,945
I THINK IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL OPERATION THAT WAS DIRECTED BY

180
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:37,847
OPERATION THAT WAS DIRECTED BY MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN BECAUSE HE

181
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,882
MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN BECAUSE HE HAS SUCH AN OVERARCHING CONTROL

182
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:40,916
HAS SUCH AN OVERARCHING CONTROL OVER ALL INTELLIGENCE AND

183
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,651
OVER ALL INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY MATTERS IN SAUDI ARABIA

184
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,186
SECURITY MATTERS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ALL OF THE SERVICES THERE.

185
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:46,155
AND ALL OF THE SERVICES THERE. AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AS

186
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:47,957
AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AS AUDACIOUS AS IT WAS TO CARRY OUT

187
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,159
AUDACIOUS AS IT WAS TO CARRY OUT THIS ACTION AGAINST A U.S.

188
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,594
THIS ACTION AGAINST A U.S. RESIDENT, JOURNALIST FOR THE

189
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:53,963
RESIDENT, JOURNALIST FOR THE "WASHINGTON POST," IN A SAUDI

190
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,498
"WASHINGTON POST," IN A SAUDI DIPLOMATIC MISSION ABROAD WOULD

191
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:56,699
DIPLOMATIC MISSION ABROAD WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE HIGHEST LEVEL

192
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,501
HAVE REQUIRED THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF APPROVAL IN THE SAUDI

193
00:04:58,502 --> 00:04:58,901
OF APPROVAL IN THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

194
00:04:58,902 --> 00:04:59,902
GOVERNMENT. TODAY, BASICALLY THAT IS

195
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:00,836
TODAY, BASICALLY THAT IS MOHAMMED BIN SAL MAN.

196
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:03,306
MOHAMMED BIN SAL MAN. THE WAY IT WAS CARRIED OUT,

197
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,608
THE WAY IT WAS CARRIED OUT, THOUGH, IN SUCH A HORRIFIC

198
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,176
THOUGH, IN SUCH A HORRIFIC MANNER AND AWFUL, IT WAS VERY

199
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,810
MANNER AND AWFUL, IT WAS VERY HAM HANDED.

200
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:09,478
HAM HANDED. IT WAS, HOW DID THEY EVER EXPECT

201
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,479
IT WAS, HOW DID THEY EVER EXPECT TO GET AWAY WITH THIS?

202
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,081
TO GET AWAY WITH THIS? I SCRATCH MY HEAD.

203
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:12,515
I SCRATCH MY HEAD. I DON’T KNOW.

204
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:15,418
I DON’T KNOW. >> YEAH, IT REMINDS ME OF THE

205
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:16,719
>> YEAH, IT REMINDS ME OF THE SKRIPAL CHEMICAL WEAPONS

206
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,421
SKRIPAL CHEMICAL WEAPONS DEPLOYMENT BY THE RUSSIANS IN

207
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:21,391
DEPLOYMENT BY THE RUSSIANS IN WHICH IT SEEMED TO ME THE POINT

208
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:22,925
WHICH IT SEEMED TO ME THE POINT OF THAT WAS TO SEND A MESSAGE.

209
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,160
OF THAT WAS TO SEND A MESSAGE. DOING IT IN A WAY WHERE IT’S

210
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:25,194
DOING IT IN A WAY WHERE IT’S OBVIOUSLY THEM AND THEY’RE

211
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:26,195
OBVIOUSLY THEM AND THEY’RE SELLING TO EVERYONE ELSE.

212
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,096
SELLING TO EVERYONE ELSE. WE CAN FIND YOU TOO.

213
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:28,497
WE CAN FIND YOU TOO. I WONDER IF THAT’S THE POINT

214
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:28,798
I WONDER IF THAT’S THE POINT HERE.

215
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,932
HERE. >> WELL, I THINK THAT CERTAINLY

216
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,233
>> WELL, I THINK THAT CERTAINLY WAS THE RUSSIAN INTENTION WHEN

217
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:33,736
WAS THE RUSSIAN INTENTION WHEN THEY TRIED TO POISON THE FORMER

218
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:37,440
THEY TRIED TO POISON THE FORMER RUSSIAN DEFECTOR SKRIPAL IN THE

219
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,142
RUSSIAN DEFECTOR SKRIPAL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THERE WAS

220
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:40,109
UNITED KINGDOM AND THERE WAS PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY THE

221
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:40,610
PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY THE RUSSIANS HAD.

222
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,312
RUSSIANS HAD. >> IT’S A WINK, WINK, NOD, NOD,

223
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:43,546
>> IT’S A WINK, WINK, NOD, NOD, WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS DID IT.

224
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:46,182
WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS DID IT. >> BUT YOU DIDN’T HAVE ALL OF

225
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:49,252
>> BUT YOU DIDN’T HAVE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE --

226
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:49,719
THE EVIDENCE -- >> GOOD POINT.

227
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:50,653
>> GOOD POINT. >> -- THAT HAS PILED UP.

228
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:54,423
>> -- THAT HAS PILED UP. IF KHASHOGGI DISAPPEARED IN A

229
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,959
IF KHASHOGGI DISAPPEARED IN A HOTEL OR PRIVATE RESIDENCE, THEN

230
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:56,726
HOTEL OR PRIVATE RESIDENCE, THEN THERE WOULD BE QUESTIONS ABOUT

231
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,827
THERE WOULD BE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, WHO ARE THESE

232
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:58,161
WHAT HAPPENED, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE.

233
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,462
PEOPLE. BUT IN THE CONSULATE, WITH THESE

234
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:01,397
BUT IN THE CONSULATE, WITH THESE TWO AIRPLANES THAT CAME FROM

235
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:02,665
TWO AIRPLANES THAT CAME FROM SAUDI ARABIA, ROYAL AIRPLANES

236
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,233
SAUDI ARABIA, ROYAL AIRPLANES THAT LANDED AND INDIVIDUALS WHO

237
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:06,770
THAT LANDED AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ENTERED TURKEY ON DIPLOMATIC

238
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:07,670
ENTERED TURKEY ON DIPLOMATIC PASSPORTS, AND THAT WERE, IN

239
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:10,373
PASSPORTS, AND THAT WERE, IN FACT, ASSOCIATED WITH MOHAMMAD

240
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:11,507
FACT, ASSOCIATED WITH MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, DOESN’T SEEM LIKE

241
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,076
BIN SALMAN, DOESN’T SEEM LIKE THEY TRIED TO COVER THEIR

242
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:13,376
THEY TRIED TO COVER THEIR TRACKS.

243
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,944
TRACKS. THAT’S WHAT’S SO CONFOUNDING

244
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,080
THAT’S WHAT’S SO CONFOUNDING ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING, THAT

245
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,748
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING, THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET AWAY

246
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:22,385
THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH THIS, AND HE’S VERY BRAZEN,

247
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:22,752
WITH THIS, AND HE’S VERY BRAZEN, OBVIOUSLY.

248
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,287
OBVIOUSLY. I THINK INCREASINGLY RECKLESS.

249
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,588
I THINK INCREASINGLY RECKLESS. HE HAS THIS CONTROL.

250
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,892
HE HAS THIS CONTROL. BUT IT SHOWS JUST HOW ANGRY HE

251
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:30,594
BUT IT SHOWS JUST HOW ANGRY HE WAS AT KHASHOGGI.

252
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,330
WAS AT KHASHOGGI. AND HE PROBABLY WAS TRYING -- HE

253
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:34,197
AND HE PROBABLY WAS TRYING -- HE WAS TRYING TO SILENCE HIM.

254
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,632
WAS TRYING TO SILENCE HIM. MAYBE HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO

255
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,001
MAYBE HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEND A SIGNAL TO

256
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:38,301
BE ABLE TO SEND A SIGNAL TO OTHERS.

257
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,036
OTHERS. THE WAY THIS HAS NOW EVOLVED

258
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,671
THE WAY THIS HAS NOW EVOLVED IT’S A MAJOR CRISIS FOR

259
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,173
IT’S A MAJOR CRISIS FOR U.S./SAUDI RELATIONS AND FOR THE

260
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:43,673
U.S./SAUDI RELATIONS AND FOR THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

261
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,308
SAUDI GOVERNMENT. >> IT ALSO SEEMS NOW WE’RE IN

262
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:51,781
>> IT ALSO SEEMS NOW WE’RE IN THIS SURREAL AND MORALLY

263
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,516
THIS SURREAL AND MORALLY HORRIFIC SITUATION IN WHICH THE

264
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:53,216
HORRIFIC SITUATION IN WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SAUDIS SEEM

265
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:53,950
WHITE HOUSE AND THE SAUDIS SEEM TO BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

266
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:54,785
TO BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT STORY THEY CAN COME UP WITH THAT

267
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,420
STORY THEY CAN COME UP WITH THAT THEY CAN BOTH HAVE

268
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:58,088
THEY CAN BOTH HAVE PLAUSIBILITY -- FOR MOHAMMAD BIN

269
00:06:58,122 --> 00:06:58,422
PLAUSIBILITY -- FOR MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN.

270
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:01,124
SALMAN. >> YES, AND THEIR CHALLENGE IS

271
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:01,858
>> YES, AND THEIR CHALLENGE IS THAT THEY DON’T KNOW THE FULL

272
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:03,427
THAT THEY DON’T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT THE U.S.

273
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:04,461
EXTENT OF WHAT THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND THE

274
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:05,028
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND THE TURKS KNOW.

275
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,596
TURKS KNOW. SO I’M SURE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

276
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,931
SO I’M SURE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO TRY TO CONCOCT A

277
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,833
WORKING TO TRY TO CONCOCT A STORY THAT’S GOING TO STAND UP

278
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,735
STORY THAT’S GOING TO STAND UP TO THE SCRUTINY THAT WILL BE

279
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:14,838
TO THE SCRUTINY THAT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY PUT ON IT.

280
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,540
IMMEDIATELY PUT ON IT. AND SO HOW CAN THEY CLAIM THEN

281
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,142
AND SO HOW CAN THEY CLAIM THEN THAT MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN HAD NO

282
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:19,076
THAT MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER?

283
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,944
RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER? AND IS HE LOOKING FOR THE

284
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,013
AND IS HE LOOKING FOR THE SCAPEGOATS INSIDE OF SAUDI

285
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:23,347
SCAPEGOATS INSIDE OF SAUDI ARABIA?

286
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:25,449
ARABIA? HAS HE ALREADY TAKEN ACTION

287
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,650
HAS HE ALREADY TAKEN ACTION AGAINST THEM TO SILENCE THEM?

288
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:30,087
AGAINST THEM TO SILENCE THEM? IF HE DOES THAT THOUGH, IF U.S.

289
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:32,155
IF HE DOES THAT THOUGH, IF U.S. INTELLIGENCE HAS DAMNING

290
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:32,923
INTELLIGENCE HAS DAMNING AUTHORIZATION ABOUT HIS ROLE,

291
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:34,224
AUTHORIZATION ABOUT HIS ROLE, HIS STORY IS GOING TO FALL

292
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:34,524
HIS STORY IS GOING TO FALL APART.

293
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:35,726
APART. THAT’S WHY IT’S SO IMPORTANT FOR

294
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:40,464
THAT’S WHY IT’S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, AND

295
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:40,965
THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, AND CI,

296
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,566
CI, CIA, TO FULLY BRIEF THE

297
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:43,534
CIA, TO FULLY BRIEF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES ON THE

298
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,169
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES ON THE HILL SO THAT THEY HAVE FULL

299
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,170
HILL SO THAT THEY HAVE FULL INSIGHT INTO WHAT HAPPENED THERE

300
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:48,739
INSIGHT INTO WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND THEY CAN THEN HOLD THE

301
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,940
AND THEY CAN THEN HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION’S FEET TO THE

302
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:50,274
ADMINISTRATION’S FEET TO THE FIRE.

303
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:51,308
FIRE. I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE

304
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,476
I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE CONGRESS IS GOING TO BE SO

305
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:53,610
CONGRESS IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF MR. TRUMP

306
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,380
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF MR. TRUMP AND OTHERS TRY, IN FACT, TO

307
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:58,449
AND OTHERS TRY, IN FACT, TO GLOSS OVER THIS SOMEHOW, I DON’T

308
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,685
GLOSS OVER THIS SOMEHOW, I DON’T BELIEVE THAT THE CONGRESS, EVEN

309
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,055
BELIEVE THAT THE CONGRESS, EVEN PEOPLE LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO

310
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:04,755
PEOPLE LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE

311
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:05,489
HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION, HAS COME OUT

312
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,691
ADMINISTRATION, HAS COME OUT WITH FIRE AND FURY AGAINST THIS.

313
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:08,426
WITH FIRE AND FURY AGAINST THIS. >> I SHOULD SAY THAT SENATOR BOB

314
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,561
>> I SHOULD SAY THAT SENATOR BOB CORKER WHO CHAIRS THE FOREIGN

315
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:12,196
CORKER WHO CHAIRS THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE SAID HE’S

316
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:13,497
RELATIONS COMMITTEE SAID HE’S BEEN DENIED BRIEFINGS, THAT THE

317
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:14,598
BEEN DENIED BRIEFINGS, THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO CLOSE

318
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,499
WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO CLOSE DOWN INFORMATION AND HE’S ANGRY

319
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:16,133
DOWN INFORMATION AND HE’S ANGRY ABOUT THAT.

320
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:18,369
ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT WE’RE GOING TO SEE

321
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,104
I THINK THAT WE’RE GOING TO SEE MORE FIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL ABOUT

322
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:20,371
MORE FIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL ABOUT IT.

323
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:25,109
IT. >> THE SENATE -- UNDER RICHARD
