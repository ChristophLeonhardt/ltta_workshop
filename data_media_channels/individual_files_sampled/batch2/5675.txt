joined now by center Kamala Harris thank you for making time I know you've been voting today so we've been awaiting what you wanted to say first of all tell me what you think should happen next as far as the trouble administration is concerned with the family separation policy well they need to end this this policy it is unconscionable it is immoral it is wrong and it is unnecessary and and I think that there is no question that it has become very evident to many many people who have been watching the images that this is not reflective of who we are as a country and it's got to stop re it's just got to stop . it's gotta stop what do you think secretary nielsen should do at this point I think she should resign I think she should resign I think she is not equipped based on her conduct based on the the procedures and the policies that she is promulgating I don't think she is equipped to do the job the way that that it needs to be done which is that there should be values that are at play that are consistent with who we say we are as Americans the government should be in the business of keeping families together not tearing families apart and not tearing children from their parents in cases that we've heard of a child being breastfed and and taken from from their mother they're the horrible case of this this father you know bright before Father's Day who ended up committing suicide after his toddler was taken from him this is unnecessary it is something the administration visited upon themselves and they need to end it and she has not had the courage or the ability to stand up and say you know what I have the discretion and I'm gonna exercise discretion in the right way that is reflective of the values of who we are as Americans she needs to go when she says as she repeated today from the White House podium there's no family separation policy and there's no abuse of the rights of children is she lying I have asked these questions I've been asking these questions of the secretaries both she and John Kelly and the Acting Secretary Duke since March of last year and actually Duke who is acting at one moment she said that they openly had been discussing this policy of separating these families and separating these children from the parents and there have been countless people from the administration who have admitted that the purpose apparently of separating these these families is to create deterrence against other immigrants coming to our shores so clearly there is a policy that is at play and she might be mixing words but there is a very clear intent and they are carrying out the intent which is to separate these families and put these children in cages I want to play for you this audio that's leaked just recently late today courtesy of ProPublica NBC has not independently verified it but but you've probably heard about it we played at the top of our broadcast it is difficult to listen to but I wanted to get your response take a listen and Senator since I know that you're on an earpiece and you join us from voting I'll just read some of it on the translation it's children screaming for their parents saying the asking for their father their father for the mother saying mommy then a Border Patrol agent identified by ProPublica says well this is a quote Orchestra here we're only missing a conductor and another child then pleading oh when could my aunt come and pick me up I have the number memorized not even yet understanding what's being done to them your response to this being what the policy looks like I mean it's heartbreaking Ari it's heartbreaking and it's it's unnecessary you know it's it's really unconscionable the the American Medical Association the Academy of physicians and pediatricians have all looked specifically at what's happening with these children being separated from their parents and have documented and have projected potentially lifelong trauma being caused to these children they're innocent they're innocent and they're being traumatized anyone who has parented a child or a Bennett child my god the idea that we would be removing these babies from their parents and it's not necessary Ari that's the thing that is so outrageous and maybe even compelling about this it's not necessary the law does not require it and certainly ethics and morals don't require it why are they doing it you know why they're doing it because it is exactly what they told us they would do you know Maya Angelou said that years ago people tell you who they are listen the first time they told us months ago that this would be a policy that they would pursue to create a disincentive a deterrent for these folks and these families to come to our border many of whom are seeking asylum many of them are fleeing the murder capitals of the world murder capitals of the world and this is what we're doing this is not reflective of who we are as a country and it has got to stop it really has to stop and and the guys are playing politics with this issue re they've got it at some point everybody has to say you know what I'm gonna draw a line somewhere and this is where I'm gonna draw the line well and it seems it's yes I do when it seems some people are doing that I don't tonight your calling as you just did on our air and no on certain terms for the resignation of the DHS secretary hey I'm already Melbourne
