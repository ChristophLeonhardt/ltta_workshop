Pew Research spent a considerable amount of time and interviewed about 2,500 people in order to tell us something that we already suspected Democrats and Republicans don't seem to agree on much and they especially don't agree on the issue of higher education and whether or not it has a positive impact on society now there were a number of issues that were looked at during this survey but there were some interesting outcomes that I want to share with you guys first off the survey found that a majority of Republicans and republican-leaning independents about 58% now say that colleges and universities have a negative effect on the country and that's actually up from 45 percent last year so the most notable thing about this is that there has been a huge difference in their opinion regarding higher education in a relatively short period of time so in September of 2015 for instance 54% of Republicans said colleges and universities had a positive impact 37% rated their impact negatively so let's quickly look at Democrats and compare them so most Democrats and Democratic leaner 72% say colleges and universities have a positive effect so you see that there's a pretty stark difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to the issue of higher education yeah so if you do a factor propaganda you could almost get well first of all I honestly - do anything right almost anything right and we've seen that in horrific situations throughout history it's not one particular class of people but if you are authoritative by nature you're more likely to believe people in authority positions of authority well that makes you more of a conservative that is part of what is a conservative liberals have less deference to Authority and in fact conservatives frown upon that they are liberals they won't listen to you know their priests and their leaders and cetera right well then that allows you to be more susceptible to propaganda if your leaders decide to go in one direction and in this case they have and so Republicans opinions on college on colleges and universities have dropped by 18 points in just two years that is a gigantic drop and speaking of propaganda if you look at this whole survey by the way it's not just it's not just colleges and universities it's what we tell you about all the time Republicans have a poor opinion of the national news media they didn't test it in this case but science they have a poor opinion of science overall and but they have very high opinion of churches and and religious figures so do most Democrats that's right there's a difference between Democrats and Republicans but the difference regarding religion isn't that stark believe it or not we'll get to that in just a second but regarding education I think that there is also something else at play and you briefly touched on it so the issue of propaganda right what I've noticed over the last couple years is that people in the media and politicians who are educated who have obtained a college education many of which have gone to Ivy League schools are fighting tooth and nail to like tear public education apart and to belittle or minimize the importance of obtaining a college education right and I think the whole reason why they do that is because they want to keep you stupid and unfortunately there is a political party that's falling for it they want to convince you that education is bad for you that it's actually destructive to society but what is the number one indicator of whether or not you're gonna have great economic opportunities in the future or decent economic opportunities in the future it's if you have an education right how do you protect yourself from scams and people who want to take advantage of you if you're not ignorant if you are educated if you know what what's really going on how the world works how things work around you like they want to keep you stupid and while they do this while they you know push their ridiculous anti education propaganda out there and while people buy into it what are they doing they're easily take money out of public schools for you know funding these vouchers funding these private schools that don't have to abide by you know educational standards at all in a lot of cases and and we're allowing them to basically destruct the one thing that really leads to a level playing field in America you know it's interesting to the point you made earlier for people that make for Republicans that make less than $30,000 46 percent that say their colleges and universities have a positive effect so relative to the others is a it's actually a high number for Republicans who make over $30,000 that number drops all the way down to 32 percent saying positive effect so if you don't have money as a Republican you think well going to college might be a good thing the way to improve myself right for the wrongs who do have money they go no no college is a bad thing right and and look there are so many caveats and so many nuances to what we're talking about because look there is a huge downside to getting a higher education right now right you go into debt and that's something that needs to be reformed is something that needs to change that doesn't mean that higher education is a bad thing it means that the way that we're funding it the way that we're charging students that's a bad thing that absolutely does need to be reformed but when Republicans are criticizing higher education they're not criticizing it because they feel bad for the amount of money that students have to take out for loans they're criticizing it because they think oh they go there and Coulter has a chapter in her book which I'm unfortunately having to read because I'm about to debate her right and she talks about how the only purpose for higher education is to churn out social justice warriors that's it that's all they do thank you wonder core no she went to Cornell come on you think don't don't let her treat you like you're stupid okay she got her higher education she knows the way the world works she and other Republicans conservatives they know how the world works if you don't have any education if you don't have higher education your chances of earning a decent income in this country very slim okay yeah well so Ann Coulter and all other conservatives can't fill your head with junk if you already learned something about the wrong so whatever you do don't trust colleges don't trust the media don't trust science don't trust anything that brings you facts if you went to a real University you might not then go to Trump University and that would cost on the Trump's of money yeah if you like this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent
