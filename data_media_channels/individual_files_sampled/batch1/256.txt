nestling in a natural bowl of the neck our Valley Stuttgart is renowned as a cradle of the automobile several famous manufacturers have important bases here but therein lies the problem because with the car comes pollution which often lingers in the air because of the local topography to combat it the city has pollution meters set up in many locations gauging the amount of nitrogen dioxide and minut particles of fine dust in the air a sophisticated alarm system warns people when the levels are too high but local authorities say more needs to be done the federal level needs to spend more money for the for the local level at the moment we have what they call as fort program so as a QuickStart program which is 1 billion euros which is not that that few money but regarding looking to the cities in Germany which are 90 cities who have the problem 1 billion euro is not that much money and given it so far in January the fine dust alarm has been triggered seven times other local solutions are being explored such as the fine dust eater it uses three applications to filter out particulates and fine dust and although it's currently a prototype the project manager is optimistic we exactly in Stuttgart might be able to on the one hand equip cars that means everything that has to do with internal transport or public transportation with active fine dust filtration systems or with a brake dust particle filter the problem for a city like Stuttgart is that although many of the measures it is taking or it has plans to take do reduce some of the emissions right now they're only really scratching at the surface of the problem and this is a problem right across Germany one environmental organization in Berlin says the problem is so entrenched in Germany that it's taking nineteen cities to court of course we hope to also get the federal level moved when they see that cities get more and more under pressure by fulfilling their local targets so to speak to yet to protect the health of their citizens in recent months Germany's motor manufacturers have been committed to cutting emissions of nitrogen dioxide by 1/3 but the current coalition government and the likely next one have admitted they must postpone reaching pollution prevention targets the issue of air pollution is a developing danger in the eyes of the European Commission but at the local level for people in Stuttgart it's an ever-present one Dominic Kane al-jazeera in the neck our Valley
