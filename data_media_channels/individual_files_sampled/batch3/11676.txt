a young girl from Maryland who was reprimanded for kneeling in class during the national anthem has won the support of Hillary Clinton the former presidential candidate tweeted that it takes courage to express disagreement with injustice eleven-year-old Marianna Taylor hopes more people will join her cause Mariana says that she was inspired by an American football quarterback who knelt during the national anthem before a game in 2016 to protest against racial inequality and police brutality his silent protest soon spread among other athletes and this provoked a fiery political debate region all the way to the White House love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a the field right now he's fired that was not against our anthem or our flag that was actually kneeling as a reverent position responding to the girls move the American Civil Rights Union has urged all Maryland schools to guarantee students freedom of speech without punishment meanwhile the girls school has issued a statement saying it's not aware of any students being disciplined for such behavior but Mariana says her teacher shouted at her and she reportedly left the classroom in tears my colleague Andrew farmer discussed the issue with John Luton a former Missouri Republican and a Richard Goodstein former adviser to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign footballs about football schools about school and if you have a protest protest in a constructive way this girl can write letters to the editor she can arrange a little March but protesting in your classroom to irritate your classmate mates and virtue signal and that's what she's being taught mom's teaching her mom is so proud that her daughter is virtue signaling that she cares more than anybody else and I actually find that to make no sense when you get arrested disproportionately when you get shot disproportionately when you get put in jail proportionally that's not just annoying that's totally ruining your life so the fact that you're taking to the streets is not merely disruptive you're trying to make a point unless you have a goal and something that you actually have a path to accomplish then you're just disrupting you're just being an antagonist to your fellow athletes or the fans or in this case to her classmates what does she want what's gonna make her stand peace on earth and yeah will we ever get to the point where there's no discrimination no there are bigoted people let's stipulate that there are people who are bigger than they will be bigoted forever Donald Trump has given them voice but the fact of the matter is it's not to say it's wrong for them to basically stand up for what they believe and that's what this little girl was doing that's all why on earth are politicians getting involved in this why can't we just allow students to protest and perhaps NFL people to protest if they want to why is it such a big deal politically the Democratic Party in the United States gets their power on dividing people and separating us versus them there's class warfare gender warfare they want to show that everybody's got a reason for injustice and they need to vote Democrat or in order to fix it and that's all this is it's just it's pure politics rich and Hillary Hillary Clinton got millions more votes than Donald Trump did and her campaign theme was being together not dividing people she wasn't mocking handicapped people she wasn't telling punch him in the jaw and I'll pay your legal bills that's not what her theme was her theme was about bringing people together and she's got millions more votes than John I'm sorry's the voters actually disagreed with you you
