it's a sport that derives from the basic contest of man versus beast one man trying to conquer one animal for eight seconds at a time the thing about bull riders is because at the end of the day these guys are a little crazy for us to be able to kick off our tab in here that's an honor it's our very first event of the year it's where we kick it off and there's not a better place in the world to kick it off I'm Jess Lockwood I'm 19 years old I'm from southeastern Montana and I've been doing this professionally this is my second year but I've been doing this ever since I could walk I was raised in a family that rodeoed and did this for a living so I just grew up in it this was his dream soon as he could you know talk suck on his dad's back and as soon as he was done he'd always say how many was I so I come from a little town where I live and I'm from and to be here where everyone's in a hustle and bustle and it's just a office around here Olson 1410 pounds this is probably one of the smaller bulls on our - these four guys along with 31 of the other best bull riders in the world are gonna hit this place on fire to kick off our 2017 season I started riding bulls when I was 13 and by the time I was probably around 16 I knew it was something that I could do that for a living and make a living at it so you know I got my pro card when I was 18 and going from there I started watching the PDR whenever I was 3-4 years old on TNN and just fell in love with it and you know I would do everything they'd done on TV you know the old the greats you know that was around at that time you know I mimicked it right there in the in the living room my dad he'd gets down on the floor in the house and I'd get on his back and wrap a belt around his chest and ride and you know he wore him out he said are you doing rosin when it gets hot get sticky so just grab it on there okay so what does that do for you keep your hand from popping out of your rope in theory in theory your eye doesn't always work I've broke six ribs punctured and collapsed lung torn MCL terminus is broken riding hand torn ligaments and concussions you know this is the dangerous part he knows every day use for everybody that knows bull riding knows it's not if it happens it's just when and you just hope it's something that they can overcome I'll just land in LaGuardia about two hours ago I barely made the boat ride with all the you know interviews and when I saw and stuff I try to put it bother me I just I just stay focused and forget about it just another bull another bull ride what goes through your mind hang on don't let go give it oh yeah it's just a sec it's keep it simple bull riding really is pretty basic it starts with staying on for eight seconds once a cowboy attains that the score comes half from the cowboy and half from the bull itself so you'll sometimes see a rewrite or a rewrite flag is given and that's because the bull actually didn't perform as well as he should've so they never want to have a cowboy penalized because the bull wasn't good and then the other thing is is if a bull does its job as well the more it spins the faster it spins the more it gets in the air and the more vertical it actually can get with its body that all adds to the bull score winner in this event gets a minimum of a hundred and fifteen thousand that's not counting the round wins you can get ya the money in the PBR is insane and it's pretty special to be able to ride on this tour yeah it's been busy but heck I've had enough time to sit and relax the hotel room taking that before just calm down wind down you got a job to do when you show up and that's tragic bulls so you just kind of take whatever comes with it look at that look at that million-dollar smile that just made its way to the top of the leaderboard how bout a seven and three-quarter points Lockwood split number one so far in New York City for that eight seconds he is going to be rewarded for the second night in a row tie the bull goes away from his hand it makes it very difficult yes I'm sorry your last on the agenda tonight yeah how does that how's that make you feel after wait no I kind of like being last really I get to watch everyone and when I watch all my buddies go and everyone else just watching everyone ride gets my blood flow it definitely got squirrely in the last second and a half along was a little different than most 19 year old kids that you're dealing with you talk about bull ride but he's got to improve on this he's not finishing these bulls the way he's supposed to it he's a tough and a gritty little guy so he grits it out but he's taken abuse that he doesn't need to it wasn't the prettiest ride Jess Lockwood went in the lockdown mode but Matt can't guess what this is all under review they're showing it on the big screen here at the world's greatest arena the cheering is started because this New York crowd thinks he's made it to eight seconds that's all he needs to do is get to the whistle and he is gonna get the score that was your winner you the best weekend ever you're supposed to not be here and just to send please don't change anything let's get a ticket so at 11:30 12:00 o'clock last night we bought tickets to stay four more days oh my god oh my god you
