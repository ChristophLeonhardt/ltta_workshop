>>> STUNNING NEWS OUT OF EUROPE
THIS MORNING WHERE GERMANY'S
LEADER, ANGELA MERKEL, COULD
LOSE POWER ANY DAY NOW BECAUSE
OF HIS OPEN BORDER POLICY.
HERE TO REACT, FOX NEWS NATIONAL
SECURITY STRATEGIST,
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> HAPPY FATHER'S DAY, PETE.
>> PETE: HAPPY FATHER'S DAY.
YOU COULD CALL HER CHANCELLOR OR
THE QUEEN OF OPEN BORDERS.
ARE THERE GOING TO BE
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE POLICIES
SHE'S TAKING?
>> ABSOLUTELY, HER COALITION
PARTNER IS TRYING TO REFLECT THE
REALITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OF
DISASTROUS IMMIGRATION POLICIES.
A RECENT POLL AMONGST GERMAN
VOTERS SAW THAT MORE THAN 60% OF
THOSE POLLED SAID THEY DON'T
WANT UNDOCUMENTED ASYLUM SEEKERS
EVEN LET INTO THE COUNTRY.
THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE
BORDERS FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
AND THERE WON'T BE CONSEQUENCES
FOR YOU POLITICALLY OR EVEN WHEN
IT COMES TO THE SAFETY OF THE
NATION, WELL, FINALLY REALITY IS
GIVING PAUSE FOR THOUGHT TO THE
POLITICSES IN GERMANY.
>> PETE: -- POLITICIANS IN
GERMANY.
>> PETE: THE VOICES OF THE
VOTERS MATTER.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE
CONSEQUENCES OF THE VISIONS OF
THE OPEN BORDERS ELITE ARE
SAYING WAIT, YOU CHANGED THE
CONTOURS OF OUR COUNTRY.
WE MAY NOT BE IN FOR THIS.
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORDERS OR
IF YOU DON'T CONTROL -- GERMANY
HAS BASICALLY SAID WE'LL ACCEPT
ANYBODY, THEN THE CONCEPT OF THE
NATION CEASES TO EXIST.
NOT ONLY THAT, YOU SEE THE
ATTACKS HAPPENING AGAIN AND
AGAIN AND AGAIN.
GERMANY HAS SUFFERED.
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER KNIFE
ATTACK JUST WITHIN MINUTES OF
THIS BROADCAST IN FRANCE.
SO THIS IS WHY EVENTS LIKE
BREXIT OCCUR.
THEY'RE THE REALITY CHECK FOR
THESE ELITES THAT SIMPLY DON'T
LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD AND WHO
THINK THAT YOU CAN DO THIS
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.
MERKEL, ON HER NEW YEAR'S EVE
STATEMENT TWO YEARS AGO SAID THE
BIGGEST THREAT TO GERMANY IS
JIHADI TERRORISM.
IN THE NEXT SENTENCE SHE SAID
BUT WE WILL NOT STOP ALLOWING
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM SEEKERS INTO
THE COUNTRY.
THOSE TWO THINGS, THEY CAN'T
EXIST AT THE SAME TIME.
>> PETE: NOT IN REALITY.
THEY'VE WELCOMED ALMOST
1.6 MILLION REFUGEES.
ANOTHER SUBJECT WE'VE GOT TO GET
YOUR TAKE ON IS OF COURSE THE
LEFT, LOOK AT SOME OF THESE
HEADLINES AND THE WAY THEY'RE
CHARACTERIZING THIS PRESIDENT,
ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING HIS MEETING
WITH KIM JONG UN.
THE WASHINGTON POST SAYS
DICTATOR ENVY, DRUM
DICTATOR ENVY TDRUM
DICTATOR ENVY TRUUM
DICTATOR ENVY TRUMP'S PRAISE OF
KIM JONG UN WIDENS HIS TASTE FOR
AUTHOR TEAR YUM LEADERS.
L.A. TIMES, TRUMP VOICES
ADMIRATION OF ENVY OF KIM.
IT GOES ON AND ON, DONALD DREAMS
OF DICTATORS.
BECAUSE HE CUTS A DEAL THAT
MAKES AMERICA SAFER, HE'S AN
AUTOCRAT.
>> DID THEY SAY THE SAME THING
WHEN KENNEDY MET WITH KRUSCHEF
IN THE 1960s?
THESE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM
TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.
THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT WHICH I WAS
HONORED TO BE THERE WITH SEAN
HANNITY AND HIS TEAM, IF THAT
SUCCEEDS, THAT WILL BE THE
LARGEST DIPLOMATIC, THE GREATEST
SIGH BLOW MATTIC SUCCESS FOR ANY
-- DIPLOMATIC SUCCESS FOR ANY
AMERICAN PRESIDENT SINCE THE END
OF THE COLD WAR AND THEY WANT TO
CONSIDER
CRNSIDER
CRITIDER
CRITICER
CRITICIZE HIM FOR IT?
THEY LIVE IN AN ALTERNATE
UNIVERSE.
>> PETE: THEY CERTAINLY DO.
THE GENERAL SALUTES HIM AND HE
