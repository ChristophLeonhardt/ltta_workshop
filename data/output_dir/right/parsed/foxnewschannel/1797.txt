KEITH ELLISON.
>> WE HAVE THE WORST IMMIGRATION
LAWS IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.
LAST WEEK, AS EXAMPLE, THE
DEPUTY CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, CONGRESSMAN
KEITH ELLISON, DO YOU KNOW HIM?
MARSTON PRE-WEARING A T-SHIRT
THAT READ, I DO NOT BELIEVE IN
BORDERS.
>> JESSE: THIS IS WHAT HE'S
REFERRING TO.
IT TRANSLATE TO QUOTE, I DON'T
BELIEVE IN BORDERS.
AND CONVICTED FELON TURNED --
CHELSEA.
SHE VOWED TO LIMIT BORDERS
ALTOGETHER.
>> TOMMY, I LIKE DEMOCRATS THAT
ARE ON US.
THESE KEITH ELLISON PEOPLE THAT
DON'T BELIEVE IN BORDERS, THEY
WEAR IT ON THEIR T-SHIRTS,
BERNIE SANDERS PEOPLE WHO SAY
I'M GONNA SPEND A TRILLION
DOLLARS ON UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE.
KIND OF REFRESHING.
>> AT LEAST ARE BEING HONEST.
CARDS ON THE TABLE.
WE HAVE KEITH ELLISON WHO
BELIEVES IN OPENING BORDERS AND
CHELSEA MANNING WHO IS INSANE.
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT
TICKET FOR 2020.
ELLISON AND MANNING FOR
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT IN
2020.
THAT'S AN ELECTION I WOULD LOVE
TO WATCH.
>> LET'S MOVE ON TO JOHN KELLY
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.
HE'S GETTING SOME HEAT FOR
TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT CENTRAL
AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS THAT COME
ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.
THIS IS PEOPLE WHO MOVE IN
ILLEGALLY TO THE UNITED STATES
ARE NOT CRIMINALS.
BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT PEOPLE WHO
WOULD EASILY ASSIMILATE INTO THE
UNITED STATES.
THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY ROLE
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRIES THEY
COME FROM WITH THE FOUR THROUGH
SIXTH GRADE EDUCATION, THEY
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, THAT'S A
BIG THING.
THEY DON'T INTEGRATE REAL WELL,
THE DON'T HAVE SKILLS.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE
DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE PEOPLE
CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER,
THIS IS WHO THEY ARE.
AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS
A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM NOT JUST
RANDOM PEOPLE COMING IN.
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING IN THE
BEST PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE INTO
THIS COUNTRY?
THE FACT THAT WE CARE MORE ABOUT
FEELINGS AND KINSHIP OVER
IMPROVING UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA IS THE PROBLEM.
>> IT IS AN EMOTIONAL APPEAL
BECAUSE THEY FEEL SORRY FOR
THEM.
YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL SORRY FOR?
I FEEL SORRY FOR AMERICAN
WORKERS BORN HERE TRYING TO
RAISE A FAMILY AND THE INFLUX OF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN SOME
CASES BRINGING CRIME AND
LOWERING PROPERTY VALUES AND
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE I FEEL
SORRY FOR.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE
DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LINE,
YOU WAIT IN THE LINE LIKE OTHER
PEOPLE.
WHEN YOU'RE AT A RESTAURANT CUT
IN LINE YOU DON'T TAKE IT VERY
LIGHTLY.
>> THESE PEOPLE NEED TO
UNDERSTAND IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO
BE AN AMERICAN AND A PRIVILEGE
TO WORK TOWARD.
NOT A RIGHT.
YOU DON'T COME INTO THE COUNTRY
WITH LOW SKILLS, LOW EDUCATION
AND NOT UNDERSTANDING THE
LANGUAGE
AND NOT UNDERSTANDING THE
LANGUAGE.
AND COME INTO THE COUNTRY
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL NICE.
WE ARE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW
AND WE BELIEVE IN BRINGING THE
BEST PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY.
WE DON'T BELIEVE IN IMPORTING
PROPERTY.
I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE
ENOUGH ISSUES, WE DON'T NEED
MORE.
>> JESSE: YOUR GROUND CITY FOR
THIS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
REBELLING
