UNIVERSITY IN LYNCH BURKE,

3
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:12,357
VIRGINIA IS A NON-PROFIT

4
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:13,125
CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY WHERE

5
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:15,394
STUDENTS AND FACULTY PRACTICE

6
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:16,728
WHAT THEY PREACH.

7
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:19,264
I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT AND GOT

8
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:23,735
A FIRST-HAND TOUR FROM ITS

9
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:25,938
PRESIDENT, JERRY FALWELL, JR.

10
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:27,773
HOW IS IT THIS UNIVERSITY IN

11
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,242
PARTICULAR IS ABLE TO GET SO

12
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,945
MANY STUDENTS WHO WERE SO

00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:36,248
CHRISTIAN ORIENTED, CONSTITUTION

14
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:37,349
ORIENTED, WHO BELIEVE IN THIS

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,252
COUNTRY AND ARE SO ENERGIZED BY

16
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:41,053
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:46,692
>> I CALL LIBERTY THE FOX NEWS

18
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:49,161
NETWORK.

19
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:51,863
THE CHRONICLE SAID THE SUCCESS

20
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:53,231
OF LIBERTY UNIVERSITY IS ROOTED

21
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:55,767
IN THE FACT THAT LIBERTY DOESN'T

22
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:59,271
TRY TO BE LIKE EVERY OTHER

23
00:00:59,272 --> 00:00:59,671
UNIVERSITY.

24
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:03,709
WE TRY TO EMPHASIZE FREEDOM OF

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,109
EXPRESSION.

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,244
WE TRY TO KEEP EDUCATION

27
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,447
AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE.

28
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:11,516
THE TOWER IS THE SCHOOL OF

29
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:13,051
DIFFICULT VINITY.

30
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:15,320
IT'S 270 FEET HIGH.

31
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:18,023
THERE IS A CLASSROOM ON EVERY

32
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:19,024
FLOOR.

33
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,293
UNDER THE LAW THERE ARE THREE

34
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:23,228
BASKETBALL COURTS WHERE THE

35
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,896
BASKETBALL TEAM PRACTICES.

36
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:27,833
THOSE ARE THE NEWER DORMS UP ON

37
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:28,834
THE HILL.

38
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,836
A LOT OF NEW CONSTRUCTION GOING

39
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:31,903
ON STILL.

40
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,572
JUDGE JEANINE: LET'S TALK ABOUT

41
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:34,640
THE STUDENTS HERE.

42
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:38,644
THEY ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM THEIR

43
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:41,046
COHORTS IN UNIVERSITIES.

44
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:43,115
>> VISITORS TO CAMPUS ARE ALWAYS

45
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:46,051
TELLING ME HOW THEY GO OUT OF

46
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:47,753
THEIR WAY TO ASK THEM IF THEY

47
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,688
NEED DIRECTIONS.

48
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,326
A LOT OF UNIVERSITIES, YOU GO ON

49
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,962
CAMPUS AND THE STUDENT WON'T

50
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:58,664
MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH YOU.

51
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:01,033
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT'S THE ROLE

52
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:02,868
OF THE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN,

53
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,236
HAVING SEEN EVERYTHING WE SAW

54
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:08,373
WITH THE KAVANAUGH HEARING.

55
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:10,776
WHAT ROLE DO THEY PLAY AND CAN

56
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:13,512
THEY TURN ELECTIONS IN THIS

57
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:13,845
COUNTRY?

58
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:17,249
>> WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TO

59
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,417
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WHAT THE HELL

60
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:20,819
DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

61
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,058
WE TOOK THAT AS TALKING TO

62
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:36,535
EVANGELICALS AS WELL.

63
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,036
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS.

64
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:40,338
JUDGE JEANINE: DO YOU THINK THE

65
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:44,309
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS WILL BRING

66
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,812
OUT HE

67
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:46,845
OUT EE

68
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:47,279
OUT EVANGELICALS?

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,947
>> I THINK THEY ARE ANGRY AND I

70
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:52,818
THINK IT WILL BACKIFIER ON THE

71
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,288
DEMOCRATS -- IT WILL BACKFIRE ON

72
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,289
THE DEMOCRATS.

73
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,058
THIS IS THE ON GRANDBABY WE

74
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:00,592
HAVE.

75
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:02,027
JUDGE JEANINE: SHE'LL BE A

76
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:02,994
STUDENT HERE?

77
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:05,263
>> IT WILL BE UP TO HER.

78
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:07,032
JUDGE JEANINE: WITH THE MID

79
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,800
TERMS COMING UP, DO YOU THINK

80
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,769
THOSE ON THE LEFT ARE NOT JUST

81
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,704
OUT OF CONTROL, BUT THEY ARE

82
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:13,972
JUST IN TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT

83
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,407
THAN THE STUDENTS HERE?

84
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:18,877
>> I THINK THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER

85
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,545
BEEN MORE POLARIZED.

86
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:24,082
WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL IN THE

87
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,352
80s I WOULD TRAVEL WITH MY FAR

88
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:31,857
IT AND STUDENTS WOULD BOO AND

89
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:34,126
HISS BECAUSE HE WAS A

90
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,660
CONSERVATIVE.

91
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,462
LIBERALS WOULD SAY I MAY NOT

92
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:40,966
AGREE WITH YOU, BUT I AGREE WITH

93
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,100
YOUR RIGHT TO SAY IT.

94
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,635
BUT NOW THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO

95
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:44,803
SAY IT.

96
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:49,541
THEY HAVE BECOME FASCISTS IN MY

97
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,208
OPINION.

98
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,345
I THINK IT' YEARS AND YEARS OF

99
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,647
SCHOOLS CONTROLLED BY THE

100
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,749
TEACHERS' UNIONS.

101
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,051
ALL THE PROFESSORS BELIEVE THE

102
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:03,522
SAME WAY.

103
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:07,459
98% SUPPORTED OBAMA AT THE IVY

104
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,660
LEAGUE SCHOOLS.

105
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:10,962
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT CAN LIBERTY

106
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:12,164
DO TO CHANGE THAT.

107
00:04:12,165 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THAT'S WHY WE EXIST IN IS AN
