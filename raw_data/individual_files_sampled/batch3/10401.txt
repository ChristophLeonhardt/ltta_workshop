US President Donald Trump says he spoken directly with the leader of North Korea Kim jong-un he made the surprising announcement during a visit by the japanese prime minister shinzo RB who in the administration has talked with North Korea directly sir well later during a press briefing Trump appeared to backtrack on that statement saying discussions with North Korea were on almost the highest level he went on to say that his upcoming meeting with Kim jong-un is likely to take place in June and that five possible locations are being considered well meanwhile The Washington Post has published a story claiming former CIA chief Mike Pompeo recently paid a secret visit to North Korea to lay the groundwork for direct talks between Trump and Kim hmm for more on this intriguing story we can now bring in human rights attorney Eric Surratt Ian Eric thank you very much indeed for joining us well as we just heard Donald Trump said he spoke personally with Kim jong-un and later appeared to backtrack I mean what do you think actually happened well it's hard to say he goes forward he goes back we know that truth is not something that really binds the White House these days which always gives us pause however what we do know is there have been talks at a highest level whether if you believe the Washington Post story and the CIA director visiting North Korea but we do know that they're laying the groundwork groundwork for talks what we don't know is how sincere they are in bending and discuss a mutual compromises in the context of international agreements and that has yet to be seen well it's also let's look at some of these statements then but as you say from the Washington Post Mike Pompeo Trump's nominee for Secretary of State reportedly went to North Korea during the Easter weekend I mean if that story is true that's a positive sign isn't it it's a very positive sign I mean we had Donald Trump saying people don't realize that the Korean War has not ended I mean that quote ended up it's all from the president the United States is huge because many of us have been saying that forever and we've only had a temporary on the sister greement and the wave of pieces or is by getting a peace treaty established between the parties and so you know at this point in time there is a lot of optimism the optimism that they will talk the optimism that Trump may see this as a legacy issue for him while undergoing non-credible group next route knee and tough times here in the states and so with that in mind we don't know quite what can come about with this but we know that if we can somehow even between North and South Korea give Donald Trump naming rights call it the Trump peace plan I don't care what it takes I don't think the South Koreans care what is called but what we want to do is establish peace after so long and also I mean let's look at some of the details with the meeting he had with Chin's there are be I mean these also heavily focused the talks on North Korea I mean how closely will the u.s. be working with Japan on any possible deal going forward do you think well you have similar situations the Prime Minister Abbey and president Trump are both having a difficult time on their domestic fronts and in this situation we've had often Japan being an impediment as well to peace with Korea so it's very difficult to tell what's going on other than what has been going on solidly is that president moon in South Korea who is himself a progressive lawyer who's spoken of a sunshine policy and is following through on it is moving forward in that regard and whether Trump is as he says given his blessings to North and South Korea whatever that means we have a strong move by the South to say we don't need this state of war to hamper our me too require us to spend so much on militarization but that perhaps there can be an opening right now to peace but when you have John Bolton entering on the other side now that is of great concern because John Bolton as a national security adviser was asked earlier many years ago what is his policy on North Korea and he held up the book the end of North Korea so a lot of uncertainties but I think there are shreds of hope here that maybe we're turning the corner and can't go back and maybe we have the time that Donald Trump can at least stumble into a real lasting Trump peace plan in Korea and finally then Eric on that note if the the much-anticipated Trump Kim summit does go ahead what can we expect from it do you think I think we can expect there to be discussion on both sides about the militarization of of the peninsula I mean the US had signed an agreement at the time of pharmacist to remove all troops there's going to be discussions about why are there 30,000 troops in more than a hundred bases and posts in South Korea everything needs to be on the table but North Korea has also said several times in the last year Kim jong-un has said that he would consider denuclearization if the hostile policy of the United States has ended so a true peace treaty and beginning exchanges on many levels could come out of this agreement and maybe it could be just possible that the Trump administration is looking past right now to the future and recognizing that they would prefer to have a more friendly country on the border with China friendly to the United States then a country that's a strong ally with China so a lot of geopolitical things are operating in the background as well and on that positive note then we'll leave it Eric cirrhotic a human rights attorney many thanks for your thoughts you
