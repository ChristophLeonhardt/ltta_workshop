00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,080
TODD: BACK WITH A FOX NEWS

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,283

3
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:16,983
HIGH-STAKES SUMMIT WITH NORTH

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,619
KOREA WHICH WE KNOW IS HAPPENING

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,856
JUNE 12TH IN SINGAPORE.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,590
THE PRES. SAYING THIS WON'T BE

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,091
ANOTHER IRAN DEAL.

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,592
WHAT DOES EACH SITE HAVE TO GIVE

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:32,165
TO GET WHAT THEY WANT?

10
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,868
JIM, YESTERDAY WAS A DAY OF

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,605
CELEBRATION, TODAY BACK TO

12
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:38,972
BUSINESS.

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,439
WHO WANTS WHAT?

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,107
>> Reporter: LET ME GET THE

15
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:40,607
CRYSTAL BALL OUT.

16
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,942
YOU NEVER MAKE A POLICY ON NORTH

17
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:42,676
KOREA THINKING YOU KNOW WHAT THE

18
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:47,581
NORTH KOREANS ARE DOING, THEY

19
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,617
TOLD PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

20
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,151
KIM IS GOING TO DO.

21
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:51,818
HE DOESN'T CONSULT FOREIGN

22
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,552
POLICY APPARATUS AND HE WILL GO

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:56,490
IN THE ROOM AND DO WHAT HE

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:56,790
WANTS.

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,962
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS TRUE

26
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:02,863
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION WALKS IN

27
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:03,597
THE DOOR EXPECT EVERYTHING LIKE

28
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:09,669
A HANDSHAKE AND SMILED TO LET'S

29
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,871
DO REGULAR AND DO A BIG DEAL,

30
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:11,605
THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR ALL

31
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:11,938
OF THAT.

32
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,074
TODD: USING YOUR FOREIGN-POLICY

33
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:14,808
EXPERIENCE CAN YOU ESTIMATE WHAT

34
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:15,175
HE WANTS?

35
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:20,180
WHAT NORTH KOREA WILL DEMAND?

36
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,849
>> THE NORTH KOREAN COMMENTS

37
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,517
LIKE HIM COULD WALK IN BUT

38
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:30,690
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE, BUT IF

39
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,424
YOU LISTEN TO THE RHETORIC IT IS

40
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,058
ALL STUFF WE HEARD BEFORE.

41
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:32,792
WE WENT THE US FORCES TO LEAVE

42
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,527
THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND WE WILL

43
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,127
GIVE UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

44
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:34,761
EVEN IF THAT HAPPENS, THE

45
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,631
PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE A

46
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,865
CONVENTIONAL FORCE PROBLEM, THE

47
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,569
NORTH KOREANS HAVE A BIGGER

48
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,303
MILITARY THAN THE SOUTH KOREANS.

49
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,037
IT WOULD BE AN IMBALANCE THAT

50
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,973
SOUTH KOREA WOULD NEVER ACCEPT.

51
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:53,480
THAT IS AN ISSUE.

52
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,214
A PEACE TREATY WITH THE US IS A

53
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:54,848
NOTHING BURGER.

54
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,549
AT THE END OF THE DAY DOES IT

55
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,318
CHANGE THE CORRELATION OF

56
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,652
FORCES?

57
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,286
I AM NOT SURE IF THAT IS

58
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,521
SOMETHING AT THE BEGINNING OR

59
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:08,961
END OF THE PROCESS.

60
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,663
THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZING

61
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,864
NORTH KOREA COME A NOTHING

62
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,598
BURGER BECAUSE HERE IS THE DEAL.

63
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,666
IF YOU DON'T WANT ANOTHER IRAN

64
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:17,971
DEAL, MAXIMUM PRESSURE WITH

65
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:18,805
FORCES AND SANCTIONING UNTIL

66
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,073
NORTH KOREA IS NO LONGER A

67
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:25,345
THREAT.

68
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,079
A LOT OF THOSE THINGS YOU CAN'T

69
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:33,220
DO UNTIL THEY HAVE GIVEN UP

70
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,687
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

71
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,854
TODD: THE PRES. WILL BE A

72
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,589
HARDLINER ON SO MANY ISSUES BUT

73
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,323
IS THERE ANY WIGGLE ROOM ON OUR

74
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:42,262
SIDE AND IF SO WHERE IS IT?

75
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:42,996
>> THERE IS ALWAYS WIGGLE ROOM,

76
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,663
DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION, THE

77
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,397
PEACE TREATY, YOU CAN DO THOSE

78
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,200
THINGS AND NOT GIVE UP GROUND

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,205
AND WHERE NORTH KOREA AND IRAN

80
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:52,906
ARE BOOKENDS, SAY I'M WALKING

81
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:53,607
AWAY FROM THE TABLE WITH IRAN

82
00:02:53,607 --> 00:03:00,380
BECAUSE THE DEAL IS NOT TOUGH

83
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,849
ENOUGH AND GIVE A SWEETHEART

84
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,383
DEAL TO NORTH KOREA.

85
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:03,984
TALK ABOUT CREDIBILITY

86
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:04,718
VAPORIZING IN A SECOND.

87
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,452
ON THE FLIPSIDE THE IRANIANS ARE

88
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,853
WATCHING, IF YOU ARE TOUGH ON

89
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,288
NORTH KOREA AND NORTH KOREA

90
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:08,922
COMES TO THE TABLE WITH A

91
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:16,930
CREDIBLE DEAL THAT PUTS PRESSURE

92
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,430
ON THE URANIAN'S.

93
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,102
TODD: I LOOKED AT PREDICTIONS,

94
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:22,869
THIS IS A MUCH MORE HIGHER STEAK

95
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,236
SITUATION.

96
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:23,937
ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE

97
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,273
DAY, JUNE 12TH AND BEYOND, WHAT

98
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:26,973
DO YOU THINK A POSSIBLE DEAL

99
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:31,011
BETWEEN THE US AND NORTH KOREA

100
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:31,411
LOOKS LIKE?

101
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,513
>> I'M A POLICY ANALYST.

102
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,114
ANYBODY WHO GIVES YOU A

103
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,851
PREDICTION ON THIS IS AN IDIOT.

104
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:43,823
THIS IS A BIG THING FOR MARKETS.

105
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,224
PEOPLE EXPECT A REYKJAVI

106
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:44,524
PEOPLE EXPECT A REYKJAVÍK

107
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,860
MOMENT, THE PRESIDENT COULD GO

108
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,328
AND THEY COULD EXTEND TALKING

109
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,029
INTO THE SECOND DAY AND COULD

110
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,864
TALK ABOUT BIG THINGS AND THEY

111
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:58,038
COULD WALK OUT OF THE DEAL AND

112
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:58,738
GET NOTHING, BUT THAT IS OKAY

113
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,472
BECAUSE WITH MAXIMUM PRESSURE,

114
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,140
WE DEALT WITH THE SECURITY

115
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,874
THREAT AND IF KIM IS WILLING TO

116
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:05,045
COME TO THE TABLE NOW HE WILL

117
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:05,412
COME BACK.

118
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,212
IF THEY WAKE AWAY WITH SOMETHING

119
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:06,946
CREDIBLE AND IF THEY WALK AWAY

120
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:07,681
WITH NOTHING IT PROVES WHAT WE

121
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:13,453
SAID, WE ARE NOT ON A PATH TO

122
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,187
WAR, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER DAY,

123
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:14,788
DON'T SELL YOUR STOCKS.

124
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,789
TODD: CAN'T BLAME ME FOR TRYING

125
00:04:15,789 --> 00:00:00,000
TO GET
