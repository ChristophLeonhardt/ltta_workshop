JUSTIFICATION FOR HIS RECUSE

59
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,200

INVESTIGATION.

69
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:26,589
IT WAS A COUNTER INTELLIGENCE

70
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:26,923
INQUIRY.

71
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:29,959

84
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:54,317
DOES ANYONE EXPECT A SITTING

85
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:55,518
U.S. PRESIDENT NOT TO QUESTION

86
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,287

CONFIRMED IN A CASE WHEN HE'S

91
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,896
TAKEN THE JOB THE NEXT DAY?

92
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,498
BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT CAN

93
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:11,201
ORDER AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AS

94
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,235
GREGG JARRETT TOLD US LAST NIGHT

NOT INVESTIGATE SOMETHING.

99
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,577

00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:22,579
UNUSUAL OR ILLEGAL AND THIS

SESSIONS.

108
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,989
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ANYBODY THE

109
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,358
LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WAS GOING TO

110
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:36,593
RECUSE HIMSELF BEFORE HE WAS

111
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:37,560

112
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,597
OR BEFORE HE WAS APPOINTED?

113
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:45,235
HOW IN GOOD FAITH CAN AN

114
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,637
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT WITHOUT

115
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:49,973

00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:00,316
WHAT IT IS.

122
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:02,652
A FLAWED WITCH HUNT, WHY HE

123
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,020
SHOULD, AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

124
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,790
MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO, UNRECUSE

125
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,791

126
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,360
THIS TIME HE WOULD BE FOLLOWING

127
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,828
THE CORRECT LAW WITHOUT A DOUBT

128
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:13,763

WELL, I HAVE PERSONALLY ALWAYS

00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,803
WHAT HE'S DONE HERE HAS NOW LEFT

133
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,137
THIS ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTRY

134
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,573
MORE EXPOSED TO THE DEEP STATE

135
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,809
THAT HAS BEEN WORKING AGAINST

136
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:28,178
THE PRESIDENT YOU ELECTED SINCE

137
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:30,013
THE VERY BEGINNING.

138
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,414
JUST LAST WEEK WE LEARNED THAT

139
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:34,150
ONE INFORMANT, LIKELY MORE,

140
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,319
WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH THE

141
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,921
OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

142
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:40,690
ACTIVELY INFILTRATING THE TRUMP

143
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,725
CAMPAIGN, SPYING ON A MULTITUDE

144
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,861
OF PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITHIN CAN

145
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,930
TRUMP'S ELECTION EFFORTS.

146
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,431
HERE'S WHAT TWO OF THE MEN THAT

147
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,134
WERE SPIED ON HAD TO SAY ON THIS

148
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:52,235
PROGRAM RIGHT HERE LAST NIGHT.

149
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:56,139
TAKE A LOOK.

150
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:59,242
ABOUT WAS THAT THE USE ME AS A

151
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:01,744
WAY TO GET AN INTRODUCTION TO

152
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:02,078
GEORGE.

153
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,713
HE WANTED TO GO TO GEORGE

154
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:04,147
PAPADOPOULOS.

155
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:06,015
HE USED CARTER PAGE TO GET TO ME

156
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,584
AND ME TO GET TO GEORGE.

157
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,853
THAT WAS THE WHOLE CHAIN HOFF

158
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:14,257
EVENTS THERE.

159
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:17,060
>> I BELIEVE I GOT TWO OR MORE

160
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,228
APPROACHES BY INDIVIDUALS TRYING

161
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:19,495
TO OFFERED INFORMATION TO THE

00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:20,797

US UP IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR

164
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:23,166
FORM.

165
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,069
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT SAM AND

166
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:29,138
CARTER WERE BOTH APPROACHED BY A

167
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:29,405
SPY.

168
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,208
>> Sean: LYING TO FISA JUDGES

169
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,477

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,548
VERIFYING, NOT TELLING FISA

172
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,516
COURT JUDGES, SPYING ON TRUMP

173
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,151
CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATES.

174
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,286
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED.

175
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:44,053
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

176
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:48,825
NOW WE HAVE SPIES THAT WE'RE

177
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:49,993
DISCOVERING THAT WERE IN THE

178
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:51,127
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

179
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:52,962
AS THE MEDIA SAYS IT'S NOT

180
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:55,164
SPYING, IT'S AN INFORMANT.

181
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:56,799
YOU JUST HEARD BY THE THREE MEN

182
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,669
THAT WERE APPROACHED BY THE

183
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,404
INFORMANT TO TELL THEM AND SEEK

184
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,572
OUT INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THIS

185
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,641
WITCH HUNT AS WE BEGAN AS WE NOW

186
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:09,145
KNOW IN THE SPRING OF 2016.

187
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:11,414
I LISTENED TO CHAIRMAN GOWDY WHO

188
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,284
I FRANKLY AGREE ON A LOT OF

189
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:14,617
ISSUES.

190
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:17,353
LET'S MAKE THIS VERY SIMPLE.

191
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:19,389
HERE'S THE BASIC -- THE

192
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:20,723
DEFINITION OF THE TERM SPY FOR

193
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,625
ALL OF YOU PEOPLE IN CONGRESS,

194
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,394
EVEN THOSE OF YOU THAT CLAIM TO

195
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,329
BE LAWYERS, A SECRET OR

196
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,698
UNDERCOVER AGENT, THAT'S A SPY.

197
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:31,034
SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE TRUMP

198
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,302
CAMPAIGN WAS SPIED ON.

199
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:34,604
A SECRET AGENT WORKING WITH

200
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,606
OBAMA'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,

201
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,241
MONITORING CONVERSATION AND

202
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:39,375
ACTIVITIES OF MANY TRUMP

203
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,044
CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATES.

204
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:43,313
YOU JUST HEARD DIRECTLY FROM THE

205
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:44,414
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SPIED ON

206
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:48,051
AND ACTIVELY TARGETED BY THE

207
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:48,318
SPY.

208
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:50,820
CHAIRMAN GOWDY PRAISING THE

209
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,722
FBI'S OVERALL HANDLING OF THE

210
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,791
RUSSIA PROBE.

211
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,227
NO, LOOK AT McCABE, COMEY,

212
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:00,296
STRZOK, LORETTA LYNCH, ALL THE

213
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,398
OTHERS THAT ABUSED THEIR POWER.

214
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,500
SO WE HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT.

215
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,536
THE FBI LITERALLY UNDER FIRED

216
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:08,304
FBI DIRECTOR WHICH THE PRESIDENT

217
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:11,341
HAD EVERY RIGHT TO DO, ROD

218
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:13,343
ROSENSTEIN DIRECTED, USED

221
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:19,215

00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,760
TRUMP CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATE IN A

228
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,496
LEAD UP TO A CAMPAIGN WHILE THE

229
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:34,797
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS

230
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:35,765
UNMASKING THE NAMES OF AMERICAN

INCREASE FROM ANY PRIOR YEAR AND

234
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:45,608
WHILE THE FBI WAS USING SPIES TO

235
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:48,711
MONITOR AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE

236
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,612
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUMP

237
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:49,979
CAMPAIGN.

238
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,549
CHAIRMAN GOWDY, KEEPING UP?

239
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,752
LET'S NOT FORGET AFTER JAMES

240
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,754
COMEY WAS FIRED, COMEY ILLEGALLY

241
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:58,821
LEAKED DOCUMENTS.

242
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:04,260
HE WANTED TO PROMPT THE APPOINT

243
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,465
THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR CUTER.

244
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:11,200
BECAUSE THE MOST MERRY BAND OF

245
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,104
ANTI-TRUMP DONORS, THOSE PEOPLE

246
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:18,608
THAT ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN

247
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:22,011
THEIR POWER TO TAKE THIS

248
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:22,578
PRESIDENT DOWN.

249
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:25,782
HOW WOULD YOU TRUST UNTIL THAT

250
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:28,951
HIRES ANDREW THE PITBULL

251
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:29,585
WISEMAN?

252
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:33,423
HE OVERTURNED SECURITY 9-0, PUT

00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:38,160
AND OVERTURNED BY THE FIFTH

256
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,528

00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,663
YOU WANT HIM INVESTIGATING YOU?

258
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,465
GIVE ME A CALL.

259
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:43,799
THERE'S SO MANY BRAVE PUBLIC

260
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,934
SERVANTS THAT ARE DOING

261
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:46,102
IMPORTANT WORK IN THE FBI.

262
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:48,104
IN THE CIA.

263
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,272
IN OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

264
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:52,375
SOME VERY HIGH-RANKING.

265
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,011
BUT WE HAVE NOW DISCOVERED ABUSE

266
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:58,981
OF POWER, BAD APPLES THAT HAVE A

267
00:08:58,981 --> 00:08:59,982
POLITICAL AGENDA THAT ARE HELL

268
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,250
BENT ON DESTROYING THIS

269
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,086
PRESIDENT, DELEGITIMIZING HIM

270
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:06,222
AND RUINING THE VOTE OF THE

271
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,723
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

272
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:09,959
BY THE WAY, IN THEIR EYES, THIS

273
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,227
WAS THE MAN THAT WAS NEVER

274
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:12,361
SUPPOSED TO BE PRESIDENT AND

275
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:15,164
THEY WERE COUNTING ON IT.

276
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:19,268
THERE WERE FEARS THAT MUELLER'S

277
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,470
PROBE WILL DETERMINE THE

278
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,337
MID-TERM ELECTION.

279
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:22,805
RUDY GULIANI WHO IS WITH US

280
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,907
TONIGHT WILL JOIN US LIVE IN A

281
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:28,544
LITTLE BIT, WEIGHED IN ON THIS

282
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:29,245
EARLIER TODAY.

283
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:30,179
TAKE A LOOK.

284
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,547
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL

285
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:32,915
MEDDLE --

286
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:36,085
>> IF HE DOESN'T FILE HIS REPORT

287
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,521
BY SEPTEMBER 1, MID SEPTEMBER --

288
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,689
>> WILL HE FIRE HIM?

289
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,592
>> I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO

290
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:43,126
FIRE HIM.

291
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:48,164
>> MAYBE A MISTAKE.

292
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:50,133
MAYBE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE

293
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,634
CONCLUDED THAT IMPEACHMENT IS

294
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,236
THEY'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING

295
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:56,139
THEY CAN TO SAY THEY'RE GOING TO

296
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:56,939
IMPEACH HIM.

297
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:58,007
>> Sean: SO TONIGHT IT'S NOT

298
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:58,741
JUST PRESIDENT TRUMP.

299
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,344
IT'S NOT REPUBLICANS WORRIED

300
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,212
ABOUT THIS POLITICAL IMPACT OF

301
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:05,214
MUELLER'S PARTISAN FISHING

302
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:05,615
EXPEDITION.

303
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:07,850
HE COULDN'T FIND ONE TRUMP

304
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,652
DONOR, NOT ONE.

305
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,087
IN FACT, TOP SENATE DEMOCRAT HAS

306
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,655
POLITICAL FEARS KICKING IN.

307
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,657
MARK WARNER SAYS HE FEARS

308
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:15,925
AMERICANS WILL START TO GROW

309
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,193
TIRED OF THE INVESTIGATION IF

310
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:19,095
IT'S NOT WRAPPED UP THIS YEAR.

311
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:19,762
OH, YEAH.

312
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:21,130
THEY'RE TIRED OF IT ALREADY.

313
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,398
TAKE A LOOK.

314
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:23,966
>> THE NOTION FOR THOSE THAT MAY

315
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,768
BE PARTISANS IN THE CROWD THAT

316
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:27,203
SAY, IF THE DEMOCRATS TAKE

317
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:28,604
CONTROL, THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

318
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:31,474
REALLY RAMP THESE UP.

319
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,142
I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WILL

320
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:36,913
BE TIRED OF IT IF THIS DOES NOT

321
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,848
WIND DOWN IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR.

322
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,184
>> Sean: WHAT DID THE JUDGE SAY?

323
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:44,153
WHY DID HE GO BACK TO PAUL

324
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:44,654
MANAFORT'S CASE?

325
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:49,892
PUT THE SCREWS TO HIM SO THEY

326
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:51,427
CAN GET INFORMATION THEY CAN USE

327
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:52,995
TO PROSECUTE OR IMPEACH A

328
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,630
SITTING PRESIDENT, A DULY

329
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,198
ELECTED PRESIDENT.

330
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,099
THAT JUDGE WAS DEAD-ON ACCURATE.

331
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,668
ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL FROM CBS

332
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,836

NOW ALREADY SKEPTICAL OF

MUELLER'S EFFORTS BELIEVING THE

336
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,210
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION

337
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,313
IS WHAT IT IS, POLITICALLY

338
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:10,680
MOTIVATED.

339
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,316
WHILE THIS OFF-THE-RAILS RUSSIA

340
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:14,584

WAY PASSED, WAY BEYOND ANY

342
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:18,788
MANDATE THEY EVER HAD, THE

343
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:19,822
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

344
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,091
HE ACTUALLY HAS REAL WORK TO GET

345
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:22,692
DONE.

346
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,560
INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH

347
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,994
NORTH KOREA.

348
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:26,562
ALREADY THE PRESIDENT HAS

349
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,832
SECURED THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL

350
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,634
HOSTAGES HELD CAPTIVE IN NORTH

351
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:32,201
KOREA.

352
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,337
KIM JONG-UN IS NO LONGER FIRING

00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,742
THE NUCLEAR TESTS HAVE HALTED.

357
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:43,012
