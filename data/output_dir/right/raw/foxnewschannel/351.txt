BACKLASH FOR IT.

34
00:00:56,761 --> 00:01:01,532
MY WHOLE POINT OF THAT TWEET, IS

35
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:01,999
DON’T VICTIMIZE.

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,600

00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,577
PROTESTS BY WOMEN AND THE

00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,756
I DON’T KNOW, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

48
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:26,557
IT’S GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

49
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:27,525
>> Shannon: YOU HAVE BEEN

50
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:28,293
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PRESIDENT

51
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:29,961
BEFORE HE WAS RUNNING FOR

52
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,396
PRESIDENT, SUPPORTIVE OF JUDGE

53
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:32,163
KAVANAUGH, TALKED ABOUT PRAYING

54
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:34,332
FOR HIS FAMILY.

55
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,533
YOU ARE IN A UNIQUE SITUATION,

56
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,035
YOU ARE A SOUTH CAROLINA ASSAULT

57
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:38,937
YOU ARE OPEN ABOUT THE FACT THAT

58
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,140
YOU ARE A SOUTH CAROLINA ASSAULTSURVIVE OR, MORE THAN ONCE -- A

59
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:42,141
SURVIVE OR, MORE THAN ONCE -- A

60
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:44,109
SEX ASSAULT SURVIVOR.

61
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,343
HOW DO YOU LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF

62
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:47,112
THIS AS IT’S BEEN PLAYING OUT?

63
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:50,749
>> IT’S REALLY HIT HOME FOR ME.

64
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,852
BEING ON BOTH SIDES,

65
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:55,253
EXPERIENCING BOTH THINGS, BEING

66
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:58,423
A CHILD AND AS A TEENAGER.

67
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:02,627
A SURVIVE OR OF SEXUAL ABUSE AS

68
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:05,764
IT’S BROUGHT UP A LOT OF

69
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:08,033
EMOTIONS, ALL OF THIS STUFF.

70
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:11,737
AND HIM BEING ACCUSED AND THE

71
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:13,205
STORY FULL OF HOLES.

72
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:16,041
IT DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE.

73
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,310
I’M JUST, I’VE BEEN PULLING FOR

74
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:22,147

I’M JUST, I’VE BEEN PULLING FOR

75
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:22,148
HIM BECAUSE THIS WHOLE STORY WAS

76
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,917
JUST, IT’S JUST FABRICATED.

77
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:26,251
NOTHING, NOTHING ABOUT IT MAKES

78
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,454
ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.

79
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:29,588
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK BECAUSE

80
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:31,857
ARE YOU A SURVIVOR YOURSELF,

81
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:33,559
THAT DR. FORD WAS CREDIBLE?

82
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,227
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK SHE

83
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,229
SUFFERED A TRAUMA, WHAT THEY

84
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,364
DON’T AGREE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

85
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:40,199
IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT

86
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,834
CLEARLY SHE SEEMS A BIT FRAGILE

87
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:44,103
AND HAS SUFFERED SOMETHING.

88
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:47,373
>> IT’S, LOOK, I WILL SAY IT’S

89
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:48,641
VERY POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING HAS

90
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:50,042
HAPPENED TO HER IN HER LIFE.

91
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:52,244
VERY POSSIBLE.

92
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,779
BUT IT’S NOT BRETT KAVANAUGH.

93
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,549
THAT’S NOT THE STORY.

94
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,650
BUT I DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

95
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,519
TO HER.

96
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,020
I MEAN, ARE WE EVER GOING TO

97
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:02,655
KNOW.

98
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:03,489
NONE OF HER STORY COMES

99
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,458
TOGETHER, WHATSOEVER.

100
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,195
AND, YOU KNOW, BEING SURVIVOR

101
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:13,132
MYSELF, MY SITUATION WAS 1984,

102
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,234
AND I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

103
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,036
I MEAN EVERYTHING.

104
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:17,737
THERE’S NOTHING THAT I DON’T

105
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,739
REMEMBER.

106
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,773
>> Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS

107
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:22,976
AS WE WRAP UP, DOES IT BOTHER

108
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:25,211
YOU THE BACKLASH THAT YOU GET IN

109
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,681
L.A., OR ON TWITTER, OR DO YOU

110
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,849
RELISH THE CHANCE TO ENGAGE

111
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,650
PEOPLE WHO DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY

112
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:32,786
YOU FEEL THE WAY YOU DO?

113
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:37,958
>> I GOT TO BE ME, YOU KNOW.

114
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,092
I’VE BEEN CONSERVATIVE MY ENTIRE

115
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,628
LIFE.

116
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,897
I’VE KEPT QUIET IN HOLLYWOOD

117
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:45,332
OVER THE YEARS, KEEP TO MYSELF

118
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,833
ABOUT IT.

119
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:50,070
BUT I’M A MOM, I’M STILL AN

120
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:51,238
ACTRESS, AND RAISING A CHILD,

121
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,973
AND I’VE GOT TO BE MYSELF.

122
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:54,107
I’VE GOT TO STAND UP FOR WHAT I

123
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,710
BELIEVE IN.

124
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,478
THAT’S WHAT I’M DOING.

125
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,549
IF I GET BACKLASH, SO BE IT.

126
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,518
BUT I GOT TO BE ME.

127
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:05,252
>> Shannon: GOOD ADVICE FOR ALL

128
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:06,353
