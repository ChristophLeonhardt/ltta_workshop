stormy Daniels lawyer is here with me live right now joining me on the day that news broke the ties Donald Trump even closer to this scandal NBC obtaining new evidence showing the Trump lawyer Michael Cohen seem to be representing Trump's company while working to buy stormy Daniels silence tonight's story pokes another hole and Michael Cohen's shifting defenses for Susilo tating this 130 thousand dollar payment to stormy Daniels money that's now sparked an election law complaint a secret arbitration fight in California and these unusual grilling is of trumps White House spokesperson but the biggest question haunting Cohen is actually the most obvious if Donald Trump was not his client in this matter who was I'm joined now by Michael avenatti who is the lawyer for stormy Daniels thank you for being here thank you for having me good luck you have been in the eye of this storm this week and today we see new developments in this story if Michael Cohen was doing all this of his own volition and not for Donald Trump then who is his client it's a very good question and it's a question that has not been answered by either mr. Cohen or by the administration and quite honestly the entire story makes no sense you don't have to be an attorney to conclude this does not add up so you know this is the weirdest thing because in a lot of cases there's the debate of are you right is Michael right it's stormy right is Donald Trump right like we know the players and here as I've seen you out on TV today and I've been reporting the story as well the latest developments seems to be the idea that maybe Michael Cohen is just a rogue agent I want to walk through this for the audience as you say you don't need to be a lawyer we'll put up on the screen what we know there you have stormy Daniels as the client and we have you sir her lawyer then we have Michael Cohen who as recently as last week is taking stormy Daniels to arbitration trying to make her be quiet as we understand it and then the big question tonight if Michael Cohen's not working for Donald Trump who is his client and I suppose Mike my question to you is is it that simple and does this help you win or lose because it does seem that Michael Cohen's defense has become he's doing a lot of things on his own well I think it is that simple and the fact of the matter is I think it gets even simpler than that because Michael Cohen is a licensed attorney under the New York State Bar rules and attorneys in every state have very specific rules that they have to live by that they have to operate by in order to keep their license and in almost every state and certainly within New York there is a requirement meaning it's not optional that an attorney inform his or her client at all times of all material facts relating to a negotiation a case etc so in this instance if in fact mr. Trump was mr. cohen's a client then there's no question that mr. Trump knew all about this because mr. Cohen would have an ethical obligation not optional to inform mr. Trump if mr. Trump was not mr. cohen's client then who was mr. Cohen working for the answer cannot be himself because he wasn't a party individually to any of this so the options are either mr. Trump or the Trump Organization or some other unknown party that we haven't heard about but it is a very simple question who was his client yeah and this is the part that does confuse me I've reported on parts of your case that are more questionable the idea that you might get the entire NDA thrown out because of a missing signature is a big open debate in court I don't think you've won that I think you have to see what the courts say about that but the idea that their defense has become that Michael Cohen just spends a lot of money to help Donald Trump without Donald Trump's knowledge is as you say not only shady it literally would appear to violate these ethics rules I noticed in your filing you have a reference to that are you seeking to make as well as separate ethics complaint against mr. Cohen we haven't made that determination yet but this is very straightforward he needed to have communicated with a client if you had to have a client he had no business doing any of this but quite honestly and I've used every superlative that I can possibly think of okay it's ludicrous the suggestion is ludicrous I'm gonna use that one tonight the this suggestion that somehow mr. Cohen was operating on his own volition not reporting to anyone spending all at this time I mean that this was not a negotiation that took 30 minutes you don't draft the document of this nature and spend an hour we're talking about hours and hours and hours of work back and forth communications arranged in the payment it's a lot of work to undertake and the fact that mr. Cohen wants the American people to believe that he was just out there doing all of this on his own and not reporting to anybody about it it's not believable right and that's the factual side that that as I've reported has never made any sense now you used the word ludicrous about your adversary mr. Cohen as you may know tonight he's using that same word about you let me read this to you sir he says mr. ah vanadis clearly allowed his 15 minutes of fame to affect his ludicrous conclusions the earth-shattering uncovering email between me and the bank corroborates all my statements I transferred money from one account into an LLC wired the funds to miss Clippers attorney Beverly Hills how mr. avenatti or the media large I guess that's us believes this to be breaking news is a mystery to me your response well you know I've been very fortunate in my career I've been involved in a lot of big cases that have gotten a lot of attention so I think I actually got my first 15 minutes about 20 years ago so that that's number one number two I stand by the statements that I've made the fact of the matter is is that this could be cleared up very very simply by mr. Cohen providing all of the financial documents that he believes substantiates this claim of his that the money was all his money that mr. Trump never had anything to do with it and quite honestly if mr. Trump wasn't his client then why did mr. Cohen draft an agreement that had numerous places where mr. Trump word was to sign and have and has a number of references to mr. Trump within the document write it may it makes no sense right if I'm out operating my own find my own and my client doesn't know anything about it I don't draft the document that has all of these references to my client last question mr. Cohen's initial denial about the funds said he was not reimbursed by the Trump campaign or the Trump Organization what does that tell you and why was he unable for whatever reason to say he was not reimbursed by mr. Trump or mr. Trump's representatives mr. Cohen is engaged in what we call in the profession lawyers speak what he did not say was that mr. Trump did not reimburse him no he didn't what he did not say was another surrogate for mr. Trump did not reimburse him what he did not say was that he paid it what he said was he facilitated it it's a very interesting word facilitate yeah he is engaged in lawyers speak as opposed to straight speak I don't care if you're on the left the right or in the middle as it relates to this issue right now you deserve straight speak straight speak bye mr. Cohen straight speak from the administration it's that simple well it has been pretty fascinating to watch this process hit the White House briefing room hit mr. Cohen with the FEC and you and your client clearly doing something that is creating a reaction on a story that broke in the open wide open two months ago I know you've been busy Michael avenatti thanks for being here thanks for having me now we have more on this story and the news that storming Daniels lawyer was just making here with my next panel first I want to share a little context on how this nearly two month old report has silenced a usually loud President and also raised questions not only about Daniels but whether these revelations suggest there could be more gag orders out there more problems for Donald Trump Stephen Colbert was just asking our own chris hayes about why this story matters is the stormy Daniels lawsuit important or just like news candy I think it actually is important we are watching a cover-up come unraveled in real-time and it's a microcosm of what I suspect is something that they have done a lot of so this is one instance of one NDA that was signed that locked one inconvenient set of facts away from public prying eyes we have now found out about it despite initial denials I suspect there are I suspect there are others that's my colleagues view Democratic strategist Ayesha moody Mills joins me now along with conservative opinion writer for The Washington Post Jennifer Rubin and Malcom Nance MSNBC's terror analyst and an expert on how some espionage services try to use blackmail Jennifer Rubin I start with you what you just heard from the lawyer your reaction I think there are two possibilities one is that he simply was settling one case that he got reimbursed by mr. Trump and in doing so mr. Cohen and mr. Trump both violated various disclosure laws and the FEC the other possibility which I find more and more likely is that perhaps Michael Cohen was given a slush fund of lots of money and it was his job simply to get rid of these problem people for mr. Trump you know you don't come up with one of these complicated NDA's and have a whole process of sending money around just on the fly this seems like a routine that these guys had down pretty Pat and I do wonder whether this was just doing business as normal he was given a certain pool of money it was his job to clean up Donald Trump's problems and if that's the case I would like to know how many of these problems the Russians know about I'd like to know how many other opportunities for blackmail are out there and I would really like to know the sum total of the people he's been paying off and why he's been paying them off I think you put it very well and that really overlaps with Chris Hayes analysis which is is this a pattern and practice and does that mean there's more vulnerability for the White House Ayesha I want to sketch something out here on this Friday night as we talk about the president's problems with this adult-film actress with this vulnerability with these obligations from mr. Cohen and think back to the larger context of the number of women who accused Donald Trump of misconduct and you talk about court he threatened to sue them take a look a woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign total fabrication the events never happened never all of these Liars will be sued after the election is over what does it tell you that he never sued any of them in open court and we learned that last week Michael Cohen was doing the opposite trying to keep stormy Daniels out of open court in secret arbitration well we know that the president is a liar and that's what keeps coming up time and time and time again he's a philanderer he had these relationships he's been paying people off what's interesting to me though as you replayed that clip Ari is that he just admitted that he was clear that these women were coming forth with their stories in order to have some impact on his campaign so it would be clear to me then that he authorized or knew about these women or at least most or me getting paid off in order to save his campaign so to me that is a confession right there that should be investigated and and that's an important facet of this I want to play for you Malcom Nance again the record here Donald Trump talks a big game and what we see in these NDA's these gag orders is a type of settlement and yet here he was talking about how that's what he won't do now don't settle cases you know what happens when you start settling lawsuits everybody sues you I don't get sued too often cuz I don't settle cases I wouldn't cases in court Malcolm put that in a national security context for us when he does settle and he appears in this instance if you believe the lawyer we just heard from and not Michael Cohen that it wasn't you know going rogue that he settled in order to try to keep information private well let's put that in common parlance he settles to cover up past malfeasance this is a national security nightmare I mean it just sounds salacious because it involves a porn star but what we have now is a President of the United States who pays people off either what he thinks is legally or illegally whether it's a slush fund or not here's one group of people that probably know all about this the Kremlin they know everything about it because this is a man who to Russia and 2013 and did you know held the Miss Universe pageant with an unsecured telephone and whether he had other women on the side or whether he was talking to his lawyers about past cases they know all about this and so whether this information was used as blackmail we don't know and anybody in the US government who had a security clearance who had even a fraction of this occur they would have lost their clearance and been kicked out of government Jennifer do you see this as primarily a story about lying and his relations with women which as I mentioned were an issue in the campaign or do you see it as Malcolm does it that broadly I see it really I'm in both senses there is the micro story of him paying off individual women being behaving in ways that are would have gotten him perhaps short of the presidency had they been known but the larger question really is what is this guy been up to his whole life and is there just a pile of information out there that the Kremlin or other people frankly have in their possession that they can use to manipulate him suddenly you know that Christopher Steele dossier seems a whole lot more credible for those people who are skeptical because you know what Donald Trump has been hiding stuff his whole life and he's been settling cases his whole life so I think we need a full accounting perhaps Congress can do that when the after the next midterms of what's out there what are the claims that have brought who the people he has been paying off and why he's been paying off so many people over the course of his life right Malcolm good yeah she's absolutely right the whole question of national security comes into this with this continuous pattern of paying people off this is not settlements all right these are under-the-table payments if he will do that against his wife while she has having a child and do it using his lawyers and this is just a question of not just personal behavior this is a question of will he do this with national you know national priorities or national policies will he have to pay people off are there people who think that Trump is already in debt and is paying them off this is just really horrible you should take a listen to the counter-argument from the president's former aide Anthony scarab Moochie I'm gonna read to you his claim here we have scare mode she basically says let's take a listen this is an issue of blackmail when you have somebody who has something negative about the President of the United States they can use that as leverage against them are you concerned about that okay so so let's address that so and I get Jonathan's point about that but but at the end of the day in this genre as it relates to this president I don't think the guys blackmail about of course he's blackmail but I mean so I want to go back to a couple of things one yes the president has a lot of dirt that we all need to know about Congress needs to uncover this I'm glad that there are people now investigative journalists who have been digging and digging and digging he's got a lot of dirt the piece I want to come back to though is that we're we're creating a box around whether he's dangerous to America I've always believed he's dangerous to America because he can be blackmailed and lots of other reasons but we also should talk about his character and be reminded that this is a guy that some Americans put into the White House that does not reflect the character of who we are as a people and so when it comes to the midterms this year it matters who is running around singing his praises and we all need to hold them accountable as well for the lack of dignity the lack of respect for our society of certainly for people that he and his friends are exuding and so I want to remind us that this is an ethical issue as much as it is a legal one hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over
