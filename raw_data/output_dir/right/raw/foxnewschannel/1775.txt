1
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:04,995
A VERY LONG DAY OF VIOLENCE.

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,129
>> IT HAS, INDEED.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,430
THEY HAD HOPED THEY WOULDN'T

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,632
COME OUT IN THE NUMBERS THEY

5
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:09,165
DID BUT THEY DID.

6
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:10,867
IN FACT, THIS WAS THE MOST

7
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:12,135
VIOLENT DAY WE HAVE SEEN HERE

8
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:14,137
ON THE BORDER SINCE THE WAR OF

9
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:14,504
2014.

10
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,540
WE ARE JUST 90 MINUTES SOUTH

11
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,475
OF YOU BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE A

12
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:18,975
DIFFERENT WORLD.

13
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,177
ALL DAY WE HEARD GUNFIRE, LONG

14
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:22,345
VOLLEYS OF GUNFIRE.

15
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,114
WE SAW AIRSTRIKES TAKING PLACE

16
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:25,549
IN GAZA.

17
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:27,217
WE SAW THICK BLACK SMOKE WHERE

18
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:28,552
THEY WERE BURNING THE TIRES

19
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:29,986
AND WE SAW TEAR GAS DROPPED ON

20
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,421
THE PROTESTERS TRYING TO

21
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:32,055
DISBURSE THEM.

22
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:33,023
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

23
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:35,158
IT HAS QUIETED DOWN NOW BUT

24
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:36,159
EARLIER THERE WERE TENS OF

25
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,794
THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS UP AND

26
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:39,162
DOWN THE BOARDER IN A VARIETY

27
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:41,531
OF PLACES -- DOWN THE BORDER

28
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:42,632
IN A VARIETY OF PLACES.

29
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,167
THEY TELL US IN A NUMBER OF

30
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:45,168
DIFFERENT PLACES THEY TRIED TO

31
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:46,369
BREACH THE FENCE TO GET INTO

32
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:48,171
ISRAEL AND THEY HAD TO BE

33
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:48,772
PUSHED BACK.

34
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:50,140
THEY SAY ONCE YOU HAVE CROSSED

35
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,208
THE FENCE IT'S JUST A

36
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,910
FIVE-MINUTE RUN TO THE NEAREST

37
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,277
VILLAGES.

38
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:55,845
THAT IS WHERE THEY WERE HAVING

39
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:56,513
TO PROTECT.

40
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:58,014
WE SAW AIRSTRIKES CARRIED OUT

41
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:00,951
HERE AND THEY ARE CARRIED OUT

42
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:02,319
ON HAMAS CAMPS.

43
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,521
I.D.F. WARNED HAMAS IF IT

44
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:05,488
ESCALATED THEY WOULD RESPOND

45
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:07,123
IN THIS WAY AND THAT IS WHAT

46
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:07,657
THEY DID.

47
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,159
THEY USED DRONES TO DROP TEAR

48
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:09,693
GAS.

49
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:13,096
52 DEAD SO FAR.

50
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:14,631
2,300 AT LEAST INJURED AND WE

51
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:15,832
EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO CONTINUE

52
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:16,199
RISING.

53
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:19,736
TOMORROW IS THE DAY THEY THEY

54
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,037
MOURN THE CREATION OF THE

55
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:21,771
STATE OF ISRAEL.

56
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:22,906
TOMORROW IS THE BIG DAY.

57
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,841
AND IT MAY BE BIGGER.

58
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,176
BUT TODAY THEY CAME OUT IN

59
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:27,243
PROTEST AGAINST THE OPENING OF

60
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:29,913
THE EMBASSY.

61
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:32,482
A BIGGER DAY THAN WE

62
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:33,583
ANTICIPATED.

63
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,085
I.D.F. SAID NO ISRAELIS WERE

64
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:41,458
WOUNDED OR KILLED AND SO IT

65
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,993
HAS BEEN A SUCCESS.

66
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:43,994
WE EXPECT TOMORROW MORE TO

67
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:44,661
TAKE PLACE.

68
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:46,930
THE HAMAS LEADER HAD SAID THE

69
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,998
PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE FENCE

70
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,699
WOULD BE UNARMED AND PEACEFUL

71
00:01:49,699 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT SAID THEY WOULD BE LIKE A
