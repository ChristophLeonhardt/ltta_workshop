Alice Schroeder a top-ranked Wall Street analyst formerly and the author of the book about Warren Buffett called the snowball startled a lot of people a couple of weeks ago by writing a bloomberg news column in which it seemed to me you were saying that most people who do well and make a living on Wall Street have to cheat to do that is that exactly what you were saying yeah what I said is it's hard to make a legal living on Wall Street not that you can't in fact I said there are a lot of honest hard-working people who don't cheat but rather than it's an impediment if you don't because the system stacked in favor of those who do well let's start with the honest side so you worked on Wall Street for a long time yeah an endlessly successful yes did you cheat no but I was under constant pressure to give the first call to important clients to give some indication about what my conviction was on a rating frankly that's cheating and you know I did do that of course if you did that we all did that you know any time you tell an institutional investor how strong your conviction is on a rating that's cheating in a fashion it mean to me it's it's the ludicrousness of this idea that it's a level playing field right and the fact that you spend an hour with a CEO and you ask them a question any wheezes doesn't get into an SEC filing but boy does it tell you a boatload of information so I to me it's the ludicrousness of the idea that it's perfectly level and there but I mean those that's cheating that's a very low level if that's what cheating is I mean so so what you're saying you know the whole Raj galley and insider trading thing you feel like that's rampant no no and part of what i wrote was a criticism of the fallacy of the level playing field because small investors are totally treated differently and unfairly compared to big investors but it's pay for play and the laws tend to behave as though that economic reality shouldn't exist and they get more and more that way all the time and you know we really can't have a system where we try to criminalize economically rational behavior but it's getting harder and harder to follow the rules so that's what I wrote it's you know and it is true that small investors are out on a level playing field absolutely not to me that's the most important point is that it's just crazy and yet every day it seems like we try to maintain this fiction that that's the case exactly we both worked there for a long time and I think that's probably the most harmful lesson that small investors are hit with every day oh we're just gonna do this and then it'll be 11 playing fields crazy I was besieged by emails from financial advisors who are in just torment over this issue after I wrote this meaning what you know they feel that they cannot serve their clients they're under pressure from their firms to sell products that are inappropriate or just for fees they know that they're not getting the right you know the same level of service from their firms and they feel conflicted so given that the pressure is the fact that there's no level playing field and so forth what should small investors do you know I there's not a great answer other than for one thing don't think that you can pick stocks that beat the market make sure you minimize fees and understand how the other guys getting paid to look for index funds you know those are those are things I can do and and you know for example if you've got a rap account and you're sitting in cash and you're earning a half a percent on the cash don't be paying a one-percent rap free to your advisor simple things that's right and on the index funds the opponents of index funds will always say oven it's just boring it's the pursuit of mediocrity oh you've been again a Wall Street for a long long time and yet you're saying this is the smart way to go yeah I mean I'm not a big fan of just sort of mindless indexing and dollar cost averaging because when the market is overvalued I think you need to sell and I think mindless dollar cost averaging is can be very bad but at the same time you know small investors are not going to beat the market they're not most professionals don't even the ones who are cheating that's right that's right and that's why the incidence of cheat so high there's not enough alpha thanks
