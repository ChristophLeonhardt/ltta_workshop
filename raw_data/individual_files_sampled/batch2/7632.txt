one of the ways I thought about it when they were doing the nuclear deal I said even if you're opposed to the nuclear deal a lot of irani ins that are opposed to the nuclear deal are again on the right they want war with Iran they want somehow for the the Trump administration or America to go in and overthrow that government and my thought is okay even if you want America to somehow if you want that government to go away we tried 40 years of being their their enemy and then us being the Great Satan 40 years yelling back and forth what happened nothing happened they again the hardliners were benefiting by pointing all of their downfalls on America who you know the reason our economy isn't good because of America the reason there's no opportunity for young people because of America the reason why we the Iranian leadership are embezzling money that's coming in it's because of America they put all the blame on America and I said after 40 years or so let's try diplomacy let's see if anything comes from that and for the first time I feel that if you were able to follow that diplomacy there was a there was a moment where you could allow the Iranian regime or the I should say the government to come into the world conversation and say we've lifted these sanctions now let's see what you do with it now if they fail they have no one to blame and some of these protests that were happening at the end of last year earlier this year where was that it was people going wait a minute you guys made this deal and there's supposed to be a better economy and it's not better what's going on so that would have been changed from within and I'll tell you some people have become emboldened like you were just saying similar not not not as bad as it is in Gaza but in Iran there's been so lack so lack of freedoms that recently a lot of women in Iran have been taking off their hijab and they've been videotaping themselves to protest for more freedoms in Iran they want to be allowed to go into stadiums and watch sporting events there's a lot of people within Iran trying to push for more and more freedoms but we just screwed those people over by giving this regime another chance to go look the Americans got out of the deal it's all their fault and if you protest us that means you're on the American side yeah and we've weakened the voices of moderates in Iran who who really pushed for this nuclear deal right and and we've emboldened the hardliners so yeah I completely see how it's just a disastrous move and it's again not the bug the feature this is this is what Israel in the United States wants and our unfortunately our current right-wing governments as some of the panelists kept saying one man's catastrophe is another man's miracle and so it might look as estrous to us but well they're the right wing is very happy with it any of your netanyahu and you're dealing with corruption charges well this is a nice turn of events for you cuz everybody's distracted hey we're being attacked even though you're not the since the Palestinians are not attacking you well they fire into the Palestinians near the border anyway and make it appear like it's an attack and so hey you got to support your leader don't worry about its corruption Trump would love a distraction as well etcetera but to go back to the point that Maas brought up and a diplomacy versus the alternative so let's just talk about that I'll turn her for a second he came because I learned from from Bernice and all here some some of the conventional wisdom in Washington that I'm amazed by but me I'm so glad we that we did not basically on Terrace in Washington because that I mean that culture is toxic right so apparently an idea that is popular in Washington is no it's okay if we make the people in Iran miserable enough they will overthrow their own government but it's for the bad let's work it out what does that ever work we said the same thing would happen in Iraq and we level the sanctions and people were incredibly miserable they didn't do it by the way not really to the Middle East North Korea North Korean people are couldn't be more miserable there's a most you know they're in the worst shape well maybe now Yemen its competitive in the whole world and they still can't overthrow their government you know why it makes them weaker and weaker and makes it hard to to be able to to actually gather up enough power to overthrow your government as society that's healthier that has a lot of businesses diffuses power and that power is able to overthrow the person at the top but if you actually deprive any resources of the people they they're not strong enough to overthrow their gun and also in Gaza the idea was Ono will make their life so miserable that they'll overthrow Hamas how's that working out well let's go to a completely different region of the world let's look at Cuba same thing with Cuba I mean we had sanctions against Cuba for how long and they didn't work you know it still has a communist government there and it didn't change a thing and sorry one more thing this idea that well it's ok well then if we start the bombing then the Iranian people will be on our side who can say that sentence out loud and actually believe it if we start killing their family members then they'll love us and want to overthrow their own leaders in the molla war when they're being attacked by us I mean how toxic is Washington that that sentence could be spoken out loud and then that person is not laughed out of the room and but instead now again here we go with the neocons ascendant the majority in Washington yeah you're you're you're actually a lot of Iran is again I'm Iranian you know a lot of Iranians are proud of their heritage they don't support their government they're proud of their heritage and I have heard exactly we just said if a war were to break out with Iran these Iran ian's they're gonna want to defend their families they don't support the government but they don't want to defend their families two easy ways fall Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when
