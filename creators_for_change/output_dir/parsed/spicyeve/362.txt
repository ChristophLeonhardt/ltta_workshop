oh man um this lit in my ear oh hi
YouTube I just woke up I have no bad
song um but i have class in 30 minutes i
skipped my first class um i have class
in 30 minutes but guess what it's okay
cuz i'm reading Dante 86 what oh no
that's his name right it's early you
guys it's really really early so yeah
I'm being a while I'm watching him sing
cuz he's in my hood as of like friday
but um since you know i have no vehicle
it's really difficult to go places that
aren't directly north south east or west
any deviation from that is really
dangerous in terms of writing public
transportation so um thankfully he is
going to be performing directly downtown
just over one street in downtown so
there's a watch them and boom you're
coming with me all right i'm gonna go
shower in like five minutes and get to
class so i will see later
