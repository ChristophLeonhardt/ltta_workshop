I REMEMBER READING HIM EVERY
FRIDAY.
NO MATTER WHAT.
IT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT I
WENT TO AND I DID NOT BOTHER
WITH THE FRONT PAGE EVEN WHEN I
WAS PRESS EDITOR I DIDN'T CARE
WHAT WAS ON THE FIRST PAGE.
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT CHARLES HAD
WRITTEN.
I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN I READ
IT.
IT WAS ABOUT 5:45 IN THE MORNING
AND I WOULD BE READING IT BEFORE
HE TOOK ME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE WOULD GO BACK AND FORTH AND
SAY, DID YOU SEE HOW CHARLES
SMOKED HIM TODAY?
WHOEVER IT WAS THAT CHARLES WAS
GOING AFTER.
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOMENTS AT THE
KITCHEN ISLAND I READ THIS
COLUMN, IT WAS THE 2006 I
BELIEVE, IT WAS ABOUT HIS
BROTHER.
IT STILL STICKS WITH ME.
YEARS LATER, I HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY, NOT JUST TO WORK
WITH HIM WHEN I WAS AT THE
WHITE HOUSE, BUT CERTAINLY
AFTERWARDS AT FOX NEWS IN
ADDITION, I WORK AS A CONSULTANT
TO THE PUBLISHER THAT HE
EVENTUALLY DID HIS BOOK WITH.
I SAID, YOU SHOULD DO A
COLLECTION.
THE PUBLISHER SAID, IT WILL
NEVER SELL.
USUALLY THE CLIP AND PASTE JOBS
DON'T DO THAT WELL.
I SAID, NO, BUT TRUST ME, HE IS
DIFFERENT.
EVERYONE TRUSTED THEIR CHILDREN
OVER WHEN HE IS ABOUT TO TALK.
I HAVE TO SAY SELFISHLY, I
WANTED THE BOOK FOR MY OWN
COLLECTION.
I WANTED TO HAVE IT.
IT BECAME A HUGE BEST SELLER.
WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL
RECENTLY, I HAD FORGOTTEN, HE
ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK AS WELL.
HE READ THE AUTO BOOK.
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER OVER THE
YEARS THAT WE DID, AND LEARNED
FROM HIM, BUY THAT BOOK AND
LISTEN TO IT.
I LEARNED MORE FROM
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER IN MY LIFE.
AND I TRIED TO CONDUCT MYSELF IN
A WAY THAT, AS YOU TO DESCRIBE,
I HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE AS WELL.
INTEGRITY, HONOR, AND ALSO WITH
JOY.
HE LOVED HIS LIFE.
HE WOULD ZOOM INTO THE
WHITE HOUSE WITH HIS BAND LIKE
DALE EARNHARDT JR.
WHEN YOU HAD HIM FOR LUNCH, HE
LOVES HOT DOGS AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
HE LOVED TO HAVE THE HOTDOCS.
IT WAS A REAL
HONOR TO KNOW HIM.
>> Martha: IT IS SO
INTERESTING TO HEAR YOUR IDEA
THAT GAVE BIRTH TO HIS BOOK.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
I'M READING THE PIECE THAT WAS
WRITTEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
WHEN CHARLES FIRST GAVE
EVERYBODY THE NEWS FROM THE
EDITORIAL BOARD AT
"THE WASHINGTON POST."
IN THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES,
FRIDAY HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHARLES
THE DAY.
THE STRIP ACROSS THE TOP OF THE
PAGE, WE KNEW TO SAVE SPACE ON
FRIDAYS PAGE FOUR
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.
CHARLES ALWAYS FILLED THE SPACE
WITH JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER OF
WORDS.
AT THE MOST ACUTE WORDS TOO.
THEY KNEW TO CHECK ANY CHANGE
WITH CHARLES BECAUSE HE CARED
ABOUT EVERY WORD.
THERE WAS NEVER MUCH TO CHANGE.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
HE WROTE "THE BOAT DOCTRINE AS
WELL IF I COULD MENTION ONE
OTHER DIMENSION OF HIS LIFE,
CHRIS MENTIONED SUPPORT AND
ENCOURAGEMENT.
I WOULD SAY THAT AS A MENTOR, HE
WAS QUITE INCREDIBLE.
HE DID NOT WAIT TO COME TO YOU
FOR ADVICE.
IN APRIL OF '09, HE INVITED ME
TO HIS OFFICE.
I WENT THERE AND I THOUGHT THAT
I HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
HE SAID HE WAS A RELAPSER
PSYCHIATRIST BUT BOY, COULD HE
WRITE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU
WANTED TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE.
AND I REMEMBER SHE WAS ON DUTY
ON THE ANCHOR DESK ON THE
SATURDAY.
AND THERE WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK
IT THERE WAS HARDLY ANYBODY
AROUND.
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER CAME TO THE
STUDIO AND WAS IN THE STUDIO FOR
SIX HOURS AS SHE ANCHORED THAT
DAY, HELPING HER THROUGH IT.
HE WAS ALWAYS SO GENEROUS, AND I
HOPE THAT WE CAN REMEMBER THAT
ABOUT CHARLES AS WELL.
HE TRIED TO LIVE OUR LIVES AS HE
DID.
>> HE REALLY LOVED HIS LIFE.
AND HE EMBRACED IT, AND WAS IN
THE MOMENT AND ALL OF THOSE
THINGS THAT EVERYBODY TRIES TO
