00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:59,013
NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

26
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:02,249
THE TYPE OF FLOW FROM THIS

00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:07,788
VOLCANO CAN TRAVEL AROUND 430

28
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,457
MILES AN HOUR.

38
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,172
THICK LAYER OF ASH THEY LOOKED

39
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,340
LIKE STATUES.

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,109

00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:44,659
RESPONDERS WERE QUITE BY

50
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,893

THEY GUNNED THE CAR BUT SUDDENLY

54
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:56,270
DAY TURNED INTO NIGHT.

55
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,541
YOU CAN SENSE THE PANIC, GO, GO.

56
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,876
WASH OUT FOR THE PEOPLE.

57
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:04,045
A SENSE OF PANIC ON THE PEOPLE

58
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:06,414
EVEN RESPONDING TO HELP.

59
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:09,817
WE'RE GETTING A DEATH TOLL THAT

60
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,419
IS REVISED EACH HOUR.

61
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,854
STILL DOZENS OF PEOPLE NOT

62
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:19,560
ACCOUNTED FOR, SHARD.

63
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,096
>> Shepard: WHAT ARE WE HEARING

64
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,098
ABOUT THE RESCUE EFFORTS?

65
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:26,934
>> IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE THE LAVA

66
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:28,202
IS RECOVERING THE ROADS.

67
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:30,404
EVEN FOR THOSE THAT ARE BEING

68
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:31,639
RESCUED, THERE'S STILL A REAL

69
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,940
SENSE OF TRAUMA.

70
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,309
ONE WOMAN SAID I TURNED BACK AND

71
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,011
SAW CARS WITH PEOPLE INSIDE

72
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:38,813
BEING COVERED BY LAVA.

73
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:40,314
SHE SAID I SAW A LITTLE GIRL

74
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:42,249
SCREAM OUT FOR HER MOTHER AND

75
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,384
HER GRANDMOTHER.

76
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:45,286
REALLY SIMPLE HORRIFIC IMAGES.

77
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:46,921
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WERE FACED

78
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,556
WITH A SPLIT SECOND DECISION.

79
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:50,691
YOU HEAR THE ACCOUNTS OVER AND

80
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:52,560
OVER AGAIN SAYING I TRIED TO RUN

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,394
FOR HIGH GROUND.

82
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:54,995
I TRIED TO RUN FOR A HILL.

83
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:56,797
OFTEN THEY HAD TO LEAVE

84
00:02:56,797 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYTHING.
