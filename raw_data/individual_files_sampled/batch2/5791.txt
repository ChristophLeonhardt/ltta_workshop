I felt like proximity to my father into the White House and with my husband taking such an influential role in the administration I didn't want to also be running a business so I put it into trust I have independent trustees I would argue that if I had not come to Washington DC and if I was in New York growing my business I would be doing far better than by placing the restrictions I have placed on my team well despite that right there Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner two senior advisors in this White House seemed to be doing fine the New York Times reporting the couple earned at least 82 million dollars in outside income last year their financial disclosure forms were released late last night by the White House part of a whole batch that were released while our attention admittedly was on Singapore and the summit meeting these forms break down where all the money came from Ivanka made nearly four million dollars from her stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC for example two million from a Trump Organization severance more than five million from her clothing brand Jared Kushner made at least five million dollars alone from a New Jersey property bought by Kushner company last year and as they say there's a lot more where that came from here to talk about it tonight rachel abrams a Pulitzer Prize winning business reporter with the New York Times there are so many ways to go about this as you sat down I was saying we get to work with a former White House aide every day Nicole Wallace who worked for 43 I'm pretty sure she didn't make no 82 million dollars in her first year at the White House but also she didn't have the you could call it either a side hustle or a pre-existing condition of great wealth and a business empire that these two add coming in yeah I think what's clear is that they're clearly making money off of these businesses outside of their roles in the White House but the question people really want to know is are they making are they making money in an inappropriate way or they taking advantage of their positions in the White House are they using the White House is a QVC for Ivanka Trump shoes or handbags and what these numbers don't tell us is really whether they have been bumped up significantly by their platform in the White House we know that they're their real estate assets increased in value by about 50 million dollars but their income increased by a few million dollars it's sort of difficult to gauge how exactly significant that is when it comes to the questions that FX experts are really worried about which is how are they benefiting from these roles Ivanka Trump for instance earned nearly four million dollars from her stake in the old post office as you mentioned but that's kind of on on pace with what she earned according to her financial disclosures last year we don't see a significant uptick in that and obviously the old post office in the Washington area is the thing that ethics experts are most concerned about because they're worried that people are gonna stay there to curry favor with her father and maybe they are but these numbers don't necessarily give us a full holistic picture of how that's happening if it is well who is left to see if it's quantifiable or qualifiable there's journalists like yourself there's the Richard painter ethics group called khru with norm Eisen they're one of the public interest groups looking at that do you think that'll be that role will be fulfilled as people try to dig down and see if they're profiting off their time in the White House well I certainly don't think there's anything about these disclosures that's gonna discourage the Richard painters of the world for looking to looking into this I think that the fact that these folks are still making a lot of money outside of their roles is going to keep the interest alive and figuring out how exactly they might be benefitting from the White House I just don't think that these disclosures necessarily give us any definitive answers about the things that ethics experts really care about which is how exactly they're benefitting whether they're using their platforms to promote their own business interests which they've at least by Ivanka Trump for example taking leaders take some steps back from her businesses declining to be in leadership roles she's at least trying to show that she's not steering the ship if you will for any businesses that might benefit her or her husband financially we have a few seconds left so I'll take on a hugely complicated topic there are trusts and there are trusts and the trust she's talking about is the kind of simple correct I don't know but simplest but certainly they're not totally blind in the sense that previous presidents and she's not a president obviously have chosen to have blind trust you know she and her father still have trust where they could conceivably have some ownership and ability to have control over them in ways that maybe ethics experts would prefer that they not hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're
