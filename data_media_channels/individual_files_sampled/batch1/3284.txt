the four don'ts for a male bumble profile a no mirror selfies just don't do it they don't go over well no one likes them be no group shots you can have one but you need to make sure that you do have some individual photos as well because otherwise she's going to have a crush on your friend maybe and we don't want that to happen posing with maybe your ex-girlfriend that could look like a sister but we don't really know who she is that's tricky as well I would leave all solo shots with you and a woman out of the out of the equation unless you indicate in your bio that it is a cousin or mom or a sister or friend otherwise it it can cause room for confusion and last but not least leave the Tigers alone we don't know where you find them but I think it's enough of the endangered species profile photos
