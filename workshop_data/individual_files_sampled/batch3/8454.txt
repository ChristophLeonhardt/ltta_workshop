BUT DOES IRAN RESPOND TO THAT STRIKE AGAINST THEIR FACILITIES IN SYRIA. SHEP? Shepard: THANKS, BENJAMIN FROM JERUSALEM. LET'S GO TO MICHAEL O'HANLON AS WE OFTEN DO FROM BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, A NONPROFIT PUBLIC POLICY ORGANIZATION. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEP. Shepard: BIG PICTURE. THE ISRAELIS SAY THE IRANIANS TURNED THIS UP SENDING MISSILES OVER THE BORDER. DID THEY AND WHERE ARE WE? ASSAD HAS LARGELY WON THE CIVIL WAR. IRAN WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE MILITARY FORCES IN TO BE POSITIONED TO SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON AND ALSO TO MENACE ISRAEL ITSELF. THIS IS A BAD OUTCOME, ONE OF THE MANY BAD OUTCOMES OF THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR. OBVIOUSLY ISRAEL DOESN'T HAVE THE OPTION OF MARCHING GROUND FORCES INTO WESTERN SYRIA. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF AN ARMY TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY. WHEN THEY TRIED TO OCCUPY LEBANON, THEY RAN OUT OF POWER. WHEN THEY SAW WEAPONS GOING TO HEZBOLLAH. THIS HAS BEEN BREWING FOR SEVEN YEARS AND IT'S LARGELY INEVITABLE AND ONGOING. Shepard: WILL THE IRANIANS STRIKE BACK? THAT COULD CAUSE A REAL ESCALATION. I THINK THEY WILL STRIKE BACK. IT'S SORT OF THEIR NATURE, NOT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE, OF COURSE. BUT THE HARD-LINERS THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT. SO I THINK THEY WILL. THEY MAY NOT DO IT INSIDE OF SYRIA OR IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF ISRAEL. IT MAY BE IN SOME OTHER PART OF THE BROADER MIDDLE EAST, NOT DIRECTLY AGAINST ISRAEL BUT OTHER WESTERN INTERESTS. COULD BE IN SOME OTHER PART OF THE WORLD OR RIGHT THERE IN THE LEBANON WESTERN SYRIA THEATER. THEY'LL DO SOMETHING. THE QUESTION IS, DO THEY VIEW THEIR POSITION AS BEING RELATIVELY STRENGTHENED ANYWAY BECAUSE ASSAD HAS LARGELY WON THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR AND THEY CAN TAKE A HIT BUT STILL BE IN A BETTER PLACE THAN THEY HAD BEEN OR DO THEY FEEL THE NEED TO PURSUE AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR THE TOOTH. KNOWING THE MIDDLE EAST, MY MONEY IS ON THE LATTER. Shepard: THIS HAS BEEN A PROXY WAR ONGOING A LONG TIME. JOHN BOLTON HAS SAID FOR MANY YEARS THAT THIS IS THERE WILL BE WAR IN IRAN. ONE OF MANY OF THE SOUND BITES THAT WE CAN PULL FROM HIM. LISTEN TO THIS ONE. THE BEHAVIOR AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE REGIME ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE. THEREFORE, THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO CHANGE THE REGIME ITSELF. THAT IS WHY BEFORE 2019 WE HERE WILL CELEBRATE IN TEHRAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Shepard: WE WILL CELEBRATE IN TEHRAN BEFORE 2019 THAT WOULD MARK 40 YEARS SINCE THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION. IS IT THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES FOR REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN? IT SOUNDED LIKE IT THERE. IT DID SOUND LIKE IT, SHEPARD. I DON'T KNOW THINK WHAT JOHN BOLTON SAID WAS REALISTIC. I SYMPATHIZE WHERE HE'S COMING FROM. IT'S EASY TO SAY BEFORE YOU'RE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND EASIER TO SAY AND DO NO MATTER WHERE AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING. IF YOU WANT TO REDEFINE REGIME CHANGE, INCENTIVIZING FUTURE LEADERS IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY, AND YOU CAN CALL THAT REGIME CHANGE. WHAT KIM JONG-UN IS DOING IS REGIME CHARGE. HE'S TRYING TO TURN INTO A CHARMING GUY. I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER HE'S CHANGED AND I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT THE IRAN SCENARIO. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY IN A COUNTRY OF 100 MILLION PEOPLE TO GO IN AND CREATE REGIME CHANGE. WE CAN SQUEEZE THEM. THAT WILL HAVE SOME IMPACT. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WILL BE ENOUGH. THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE THEIR REGIME IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO I'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT MR. BOLTON'S IMPLICATION, EVEN
