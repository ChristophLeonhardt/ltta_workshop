Now...where were we? DONALD TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN COME FACE-TO-FACE FOR HISTORIC SUMMIT ON JUNE 12TH IN SINGAPORE. TODD: THE PRES. MAKING IT HIS MISSION TO DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN PENINSULA. YEARS LIEUT. GEN. RICHARD NEWTON, FORMER ASSISTANT VICE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THIS MORNING. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN. AND COTUIT THIS DECADE SEEMS THERE'S A GREAT DIVIDE AND A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN WHAT EACH OF THESE MEN ONCE. SEEMS LIKE LOTS TO BRIDGE THAT GAP. IT IS. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING INTO THIS SUMMIT TAKING PLACE IN SINGAPORE FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH AND THAT IS HOW HE NEEDS TO APPROACH THESE NEGOTIATIONS WAS A POSITION OF STRENGTH NOT ONLY MILITARILY BUT ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY AS WELL. SECONDLY HE GOT TO KEEP IN MIND AND NOT KEEP IN MIND BUT KEEP IN THE FOREFRONT THE NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE IS DENUCLEARIZATION OF NUCLEAR THE NORTH KOREAN PENINSULA. WHATEVER NEGOTIATIONS COME THROUGH AND WHATEVER END GAME RESULTS FROM THIS SUMMIT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE AND IRRESISTIBLE, NOT IRRESISTIBLE BUT IRREVERSIBLE WITH REGARD TO THE DENUCLEARIZATION. THAT IS A VERY TALL ORDER. IT WILL BE TOUGH GOING. JILLIAN: YOU HAVE TWO SIDES WILLING TO GIVE UP A LITTLE BIT TO GET SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT IF NORTH KOREA DOESN'T WANT TO COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZE, WHAT DO YOU SEE DONALD TRUMP DOING? HE HAS TO STAY AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, BRINGING OTHER DIPLOMATIC PARTNERS, WITH JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA AS WELL. IT IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST TO DENUCLEARIZE PARTICULARLY IF KIM WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH HIS OWN EFFORTS TO HELP THE ECONOMIC SITUATION NOT ONLY FOR HIM BUT NORTH KOREA AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS TIME IS ON EVERYONE'S SIDE I BELIEVE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A LENGTHY PROCESS NOT JUST THE JUNE 12TH SUMMIT BUT WHAT COMES AFTERWARDS, WHAT COMES IN THE ENSUING NEGOTIATIONS AND WHAT WILL CERTAINLY BE MULTIPARTY TALKS WITH THE US AND AS I MENTIONED WITH JAPAN AND CHINA AS WELL. WE GOING WITH OUR EYES WIDE OPEN, NORTH KOREA, SOUTH KOREA HAVE BEEN AT WAR. ALL WE HAVE IS AN ARMISTICE SINCE THE WAR BROKE OUT ON JUNE 25, 1950. THERE HAVE BEEN GENERATIONS WHERE THIS IS BEEN AN UNSTABLE SITUATIONS. THEY ARE A LOT TALLER. SEEMS LIKE A TALL ORDER. THAT MOVED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD, WE HAVE THIS SITUATION WITH IRAN AND ISRAEL FIRING MISSILES AT EACH OTHER AND THIS HAS ESCALATED. THE UNITED STATES PULLED OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL AMID SO MUCH CRITICISM, THE REASON IRAN IS LINED UP IN SYRIA IS WE PUMPED SO MUCH MONEY INTO THEIR ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THAT DEAL. WE HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO ARM UP AND SET UP OTHER FACTIONS THAT ARE ANTI-ISRAEL. IS THIS NOT WHY WE PULLED OUT OF THE DEAL? IRAN IS THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. AND WHAT WE HAD THURSDAY MORNING, ENCOURAGE AND ATTACK FROM THE GOLAN HEIGHTS AREA INTO ISRAEL ATTACKING ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES IN A ROBUST FASHION, MORE SO THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN A 7 YEAR. GO OF THE SYRIAN WAR. IRAN BEING MUCH MORE ENTRENCHED AND INVOLVED WITH THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR BACKING UP ASIDE. ISRAEL SEES THAT AS A THREAT AND THEY RESPONDED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THIS CASE. I WOULD HOPE BOTH SIDES DAMP DOWN. AND THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS IF NOT
