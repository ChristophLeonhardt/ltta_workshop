did the well at Christmas farmweek but
cannot discuss that at this point in
time definitely not there's too much
money in sight behind me is the first
sight to have ever been fracked in the
UK it costs two minor earthquakes there
are no industry specific regulations at
all
you know 48 percent of people in England
still don't know what fracking is if
that drill touches the ground it would
have to touch our bodies first we are
their biggest threat and we are he's
driving away okay I guess we'll have to
wait for the police
