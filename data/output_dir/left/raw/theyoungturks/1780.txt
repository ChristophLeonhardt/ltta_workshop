1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,310
WHILE THE LEADERSHIP OF NORTH
AND SOUTH KOREA ARE POTENTIALLY

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,980
MOVING TOWARDS PEACE, OR AT
LEAST GETTING A LITTLE CLOSER,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,030
THE FAMILY OF OTTO WARMBIER IS
ALSO MOVING CLOSER TO SOMETHING

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:24,019
CAN THAT'S THEIR LAWSUIT AGAINST
NORTH KOREA --

5
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:37,190
IF YOU DON'T RECALL THIS
STORY --

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,090
I WOULD DESCRIBE THAT AS TOO
MUCH.

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,350
THAT SEEMS A LITTLE OUT OF

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,350
CONTROL.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:50,570
AND IT WENT IN AN EVEN
DARKER DIRECTION --

10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:57,329
HE WAS EFFECTIVELY ON THE
BRINK OF DEATH WHEN THEY

11
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,010
FINALLY RETURNED HIM, AND HE
DIED SHORTLY THEREAFTER,

12
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,010
NOW THEY ARE SUING.

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,430
IT WAS HORRIFIC.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,030
BLIND, DEAF,
I THINK I SAW SOMETHING THAT HIS

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,150
PARENTS WERE SEEING HIS TEETH
LOOK LIKE THEY HAD BEEN PULLED

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,400
OUT AND REARRANGED.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,540
CLEARLY TORTURED.

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,120
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHO SPENT
SOME TIME IN NORTH KOREA AS

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,830
CAPTIVES, AND IT'S NOT PRETTY.

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,850
WE KNOW THIS GOING INTO IT,
WHICH IS WHAT IS SO UPSETTING.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,630
BUT I WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS
STORY WHEN IT ALL STARTED

22
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,570
HAPPENING, SO I STARTED DOING
RESEARCH INTO THE TOUR GROUP HE

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,990
WENT WITH, AND JUST WHY ANYONE
WOULD, AND ALL OF THE DRINKING

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,851
INVOLVED, AND THIS AND THAT,
NONE OF IT MAKES IT OKAY, IT'S

25
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,640
JUST IT WASN'T SURPRISING
UNFORTUNATELY THAT THIS IS

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,030
HOW IT ENDED.

27
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,140
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THOSE
THINGS ARE GOING ON, AT LEAST AT

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,420
THIS POINT, MAYBE WE ARE MOVING
TOWARD A PLACE WHERE WE CAN

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,210
DO THAT SORT OF THING.

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,540
I KNOW A GUY WHO IS A
PHOTOGRAPHER WHO HAS BEEN IN A

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,100
GROUP WHERE THEY ARE LIKE, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO GO PHOTOGRAPH NORTH

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,620
KOREA?

33
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,350
AND FREQUENTLY WHEN THEY
RECOUNT THEIR STORIES THEY ARE

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,990
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO TOE THE LINE
BETWEEN REPORTING ACCURATELY ON

35
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,610
WHAT HAPPENED, BUT ALSO TRYING
TO GET INVITED BACK AGAIN.

36
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,610
SO

37
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,130
THAT'S THE DIFFICULT LINE TO
WALK.

38
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,130
THERE'S A GREAT BOOK, I

39
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,200
WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS, IT'S
CALLED THE ORPHANMASTER'S SON,

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,390
IT'S WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO WENT
ON ONE OF THOSE DELEGATIONS, AND

41
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,050
ITS FICTION LIES IS IT IN LINE
WITH HOW WEIRD AND FICTITIOUS

42
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,440
THE EXPERIENCE IN NORTH KOREA
ACTUALLY FEELS, IT CRAFTS A

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,220
COMPELLING NARRATIVE TO
COMMUNICATE IF NOT THE EXACT

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,000
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THERE,
BUT THE TRUTHS, AND THEY DRAW ON

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,210
REAL THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED
IN NORTH KOREA.

46
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,210
LIKE KIM JONG-IL

47
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:55,680
SAYING I LIKE THAT JAPANESE
OPERA STAR, KIDNAP HER AND BRING

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
HER BACK.

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,280
AND THAT HAPPENS,
THERE ARE KIDNAPPINGS ALL THE

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
TIME.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,550
PEOPLE SNEAKING INTO SOUTH
KOREA, KIDNAPPINGS, SMUGGLING

52
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,310
THINGS BACK, A LOT OF THE
ECONOMY IS BASED ON COUNTERFEIT

53
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,230
AND GRAFT, IT'S WEIRD.

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,960
I HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK NOW.

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
IT'S AMAZING.

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,890
BUT THIS STORY
IS ONE OF, WHAT ARE WE SAYING TO

57
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,150
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH
IT, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

58
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,160
WITH ME THIS MORNING, WHAT
MESSAGE DOES IT SEND THAT WE ARE

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,870
ESSENTIALLY LOOKING FOR PEACE,
WHAT DO WE SAY TO THESE PEOPLE

60
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,070
WHO ARE AMERICANS WHO HAVE GONE
THROUGH THESE TERRIBLE

61
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,800
EXPERIENCES, AND TO PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE WORST

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
DURING THIS?

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,530
WHAT ABOUT THE THREE WHO ARE
STILL THERE?

64
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,190
ARE WE APPEASING THEM?

65
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,990
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

66
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,950
AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOTED YOU
DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR

67
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,380
FRIENDS, YOU ONLY MAKE PEACE
WITH YOUR ENEMIES, THAT THE ONLY

68
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,360
PERSON YOU CAN, AND IN EVERY
CONFLICT THERE WILL BE TERRIBLE

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
STUFF.

70
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,220
AND IN SOME CASES, THEY
HAVE SET UP TRUTH AND

71
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,760
RECONCILIATION COMMITTEES AND
THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT GONE

72
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,670
FORWARD ON PROSECUTING CLEAR WAR
CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT.

73
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,670
IT COULD BE THAT THAT IS
NECESSARY TO GET NORTH KOREA TO

74
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,360
JOIN THE REST OF US RIGHT NOW,
BUT I WILL SAY THIS: I WANT

75
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,780
PEACE THERE, BUT PEACE IS NOT
THE ABSENCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

76
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,700
PEACE ISN'T EVEN THE ABSENCE OF
ARTILLERY AIMED AT SEOUL.

77
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
PEACE

78
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,180
IS THE PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA NOT
BEING BRUTALIZED AND ENSLAVED

79
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,280
AND TORTURED AND MURDERED.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,020
AND I
DON'T KNOW IF THAT CAN HAPPEN

81
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,230
NOW OR IF IT HAS TO HAPPEN OVER
THE COURSE OF DECADES, BUT I

82
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,311
KNOW THAT IF WHAT COMES OUT OF
THIS IS THEY ACTUALLY DO

83
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:41,660
DENUCLEARIZE AND PULL SOME OF
THEIR FORCES AWAY FROM THE

84
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,250
BORDER THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT
IF THAT ALLOWS KIM JONG-UN AND

85
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,860
HIS SONS OR WHATEVER TO RULE FOR
ANOTHER 100 YEARS AND THE PEOPLE

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,500
OF NORTH KOREA ARE IN THE SAME
STATE AS THEY ARE NOW, HOW IS

87
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,490
THAT PEACE IN ANY MEETING OF THE
WORD?

88
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,420
THAT IS WHAT IS ANGERING
PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE HIM SMILING

89
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,520
AND BEING CHEERED ON, THEY ARE
HOLDING HANDS AND CROSSING THE

90
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,640
BORDER, AND HIS SISTER IS BEING
CELEBRATED AT THE OLYMPICS, AND

91
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,199
SHE IS OUR NEW SHADE QUEEN,
THAT IS WHAT IS FORGOTTEN I

92
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
THINK IN THIS CONVERSATION.

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,669
IT'S THOSE WEIRD MOMENTS LIKE
AT THE OLYMPICS WHEN THEY

94
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,500
REALIZED IN THE NORTH KOREAN
CHEERING DELEGATION THAT THE

95
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,670
CAMERA WAS ON THEM, THEY WENT
FROM LIKE THIS TO DOING THEIR

96
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,670
CHOREOGRAPHED --

97
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,720
THAT'S PROBABLY ALL
CHEERLEADERS THOUGH.

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,730
BUT LOOK,

99
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,100
I'M TRYING TO BE REALISTIC,
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T JUST SKETCH

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,863
OUT YOUR FANTASY FOR WHAT IS
WANT TO HAPPEN AND EXPECT TO

101
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:36,900
HAPPEN, HE'S NOT GO TO STEP
DOWN, HE'S NOT GOING TO DIE

102
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,600
TOMORROW, AND I DO THINK HE
DESPERATELY WANTS TO BE A WAR

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,949
LEADER THAT GETS TO -- HE IS
BASICALLY TRUMP, HE WANTS TO GO

104
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:53,170
TO PARTIES AND HAVE PEOPLE TALK
NICE ABOUT HIM.

105
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,170
OBVIOUSLY THERE

106
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,660
WILL HAVE TO BE ACCESS TO NORTH
KOREA IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE

107
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,610
ANYTHING THEY SAY ABOUT
DENUCLEARIZATION, NOW THEY

108
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,650
WOULD NEVER ALLOW THAT SO
THAT WOULD BE A BIG STEP.

109
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,040
BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
THESE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

110
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,320
AREN'T HAPPENING ANYMORE.

111
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,210
HE MIGHT WELL HAVE TO BE THE
LEADER BUT HE CAN'T RULE IN

112
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,210
THE WAY HE HAS.

113
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,840
BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT HAS
TO BE A PRIORITY, AND IT'S

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,669
BEING LEFT OUT IT SEEMS SO FAR.

115
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,020
WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY
STAGES.

116
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,750
THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE
OPTICS THAT COME OUT OF PEACE,

117
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,510
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF STRATEGIC
THINGS THAT THESE MAJOR PLAYERS

118
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,120
DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP.

119
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,340
CHINA
WANTS A GEOGRAPHICAL BUFFER

120
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,260
BETWEEN THEM AND THE AMERICAN
BASIS IN SOUTH KOREA, CHINA

121
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,470
WANTS US TO GET RID OF OUR, WHAT
DO WE HAVE, THREE MILITARY BASES

122
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,720
AT LEAST IN SOUTH KOREA?

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,870
WHICH
GIVES US A STRATEGIC FOOTHOLD IN

124
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,570
THE EAST CHINA SEA.

125
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,699
OF COURSE
CHINA ONCE US OUT, OF COURSE WE

126
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,540
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

127
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,419
WE WILL SEE
HOW THESE NEGOTIATIONS GO, BUT

128
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,610
IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT'S PRETTY
EASY TO DECLARE A SYMBOLIC

129
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,550
VICTORY, GRANTED NO ONE HAS DONE
IT BEFORE BY GOING AND PLANTING

130
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,500
TREES, WE ARE STILL, AS YOU SAY,
VERY FAR AWAY FROM SEEING PEACE

131
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
HERE.

132
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,640
FROM WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS.

133
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,800
I THINK THE MOST PRACTICAL
SHORT RANGE GOAL IS FOR CHINA TO

134
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,910
SAY, OKAY, HERE IS WHAT YOU DO.

135
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,139
YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF SEMBLANCE

136
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,610
OF CAPITALISM, BUT STILL HERE IS
HOW TO MAINTAIN DICTATORIAL

137
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,880
CONTROL OVER YOUR PEOPLE BY
DOING WHAT WE DO IN CHINA BUT

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,160
STILL BEING ABLE TO BE REPUTABLE
THE WORLD OVER.

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
LIKE, THAT'S IT,

140
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,500
AND WE WILL GET CHINA HEAVY,
CHINA HAS BECOME CHINA LITE, WE

141
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,020
WILL GET CHINA HEAVY, THAT'S THE
PRACTICAL NEXT STEP AND THAT'S

142
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,960
ALL WE CAN LEAVE HOPE FOR AND WE
WILL SEE HOW IT GOES.

143
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
IT'S

144
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,930
POSSIBLE TRUMP WILL GO BACK TO
THE OTHER HAYLEY MILLS IN THIS

145
00:07:43,930 --> 00:00:00,000
PARENT TRAP AND JUST BE LIKE,
YOU KNOW, HE'S A ROCKET MAN.
