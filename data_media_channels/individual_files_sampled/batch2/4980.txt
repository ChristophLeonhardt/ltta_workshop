that was a low point for me as well I I feel very strongly about that and and I am very vehement Lee against family separation and the separation of parents and children yeah but you can do better than that I'm sorry willing to a low point Ivanka Trump people seeking asylum in America trying to escape poverty abuse fear violence coming here and how facing never seeing their kids again that was a vodka Trump yesterday acknowledging the impact of her father's policy on herself well the policy that toward children from their parents at the US border Ivanka has never talked about the topic other than congratulating her father over Twitter after he stopped the policy that he created yet hundreds possibly thousands of children's lives still hang in the balance but that was a low point for her so these kids are sitting in detention facilities they're at summer camps some would say facing potentially never seeing their families again but also a woman also a low point for the administration as if to suggest that it's not like that's something that happens to my administration as opposed to something that the administration inflicted on these children a low point for the administration zip like you know whether some point for her and I just want to say that because the banca Trump has her own political aspirations you're gonna have to do this a little better they're gonna have to try and act like you care you're gonna have to try and act like people are not merchandise products you're gonna have to try and act like this matters to the fabric of what this country was created upon who we are this is not just a low point for you this is not something you can throw away by calling it a low point for you like maybe your company and all the people you had to fire because it's no longer politically convenient for you this is not something you throw away because it's an out of production of anka Trump dress now these are people these are children who right now we don't know where they are we don't know exactly how many they are we don't even know how they are but we know that they're being abused because they've been ripped away from their families and some of them will never see their families again and I just want to point out that this administration this administration was warned about this policy you heard the HHS secretary earlier this week talking about the effort to warn this administration to warn you it was an HHS official warning you that this was the wrong thing to do that there would be bad outcomes here and yet the president put this policy into place the Attorney General announced it the DHS secretary said we hope that people get the message this policy will help them get the message this policy ripped children away from their families and some of them will never see their families again and you counselor to the president finally speak on it and you call it a low point for you I don't think it's a low point for you I think it's a national disgrace and I think there's a lot of people who still want answers as to how these children are going to be reunified with their families and if you care get yourself to the border and stay there until something really substantive is done otherwise your words don't matter we actually don't care what this was like for you we care about the children and we care about their families and we care about people coming here seeking asylum coming to America the way many of our family members did believe you talked about your mother I believe he talked about people who come here from around the world the melting pot that is America you talked about it so positively and yet what a low point for this administration and for you personally it's still going on it's not over it's still going on Willie the other maddening part about this is that Ivanka Trump continues to talk like she's a bystander to all this she's the senior advisor to the president and not only that she is supposed to be the one with the presidents here all the children we've always heard she's the one you get warning she could not stop it and she's just bummed out for herself and again and again she comes in Susan after the fact and talks about how distressing it was as though she has no say in the matter and that's exactly right is she out there is the president's daughter she has a West Wing role and she does nothing she voices no agenda she I mean she did have one thing she was kind of involved with but this should be her agenda and to talk about things in the way of what I was upset and it was my low point stop it and do something she is not on TV as the president's daughter that's not the question she was at that's not how she was asked those questions and frankly as she sold her company to be more involved in Washington and what's going on yet I think it was either either do something or go back to New York all right we've got to get to the press angle on this and we want to get more on that Sarah Huckabee Sanders more with David Ignatius on that topic coming up thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest
