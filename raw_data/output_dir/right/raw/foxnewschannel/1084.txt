57
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:38,919
BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT.

58
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,253

63
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:54,434

WAS 2 PEOPLE OR 1.

74
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:24,931
I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR IF YOU

75
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,967
AND ANYONE EXAMINING THIS WOULD

76
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:29,736
SAY, IF YOU SUBMIT 80 NAMES TO

77
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:32,072
THE SECRET SERVICE AND THEN 3

78
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:34,374
DAYS LATER, SAY, OH, SORRY, WE

79
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:36,609
CAN'T MAKE IT.

80
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:39,312

81
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:39,679
COMING.

82
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,281
WE WILL RESCHEDULE IT WHEN YOU

83
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:43,350
ARE IN SINGAPORE.

84
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,184
THAT'S JUST LAME.

85
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:49,456
THEY DID THAT ON PURPOSE.

86
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:56,830
>> WHAT LEBRON JAMES AND STEP

87
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,100

NUMBERS OR THE SMALL BUSINESSES

95
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,277
CREATED?

96
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:16,882

WHO DON'T GO TO FANCY COLLEGES

112
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:53,887
CAN GET A REALLY HIGH PAYING JOB

113
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,989
LIKE THEY USED TO WHEN HE WITH

117
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:03,663
THE TARIFF THING --

118
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:05,665
HOW YOU TURN THAT INTO AN

119
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,367
ANTI-BLACK THING?

120
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:12,605
>> IT'S NOT JUST BLACK.

121
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:17,077
IF , IN FACT THEY HAD A JOB, IN

122
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,913

00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:24,751
THE RIGHT TRANSPORTATION AND

125
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:28,054
STUDENTS HAVE CREDIT CARDS DEBT.

126
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:31,958

SENT OVERSEAS AND BLED OFF TO

128
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:35,829
MEXIO.

129
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,397
THAT WAS GOOD FOR BLACK AMERICA?

130
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:39,365
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS GOOD FOR

131
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:41,935
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE AT ALL.

132
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:45,638
WE LOST BILLIONS OF JOBS.

133
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:49,175
THIS PRESIDENT IS BRINGING JOBS

134
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:53,113
BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AND

135
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:55,648
WORKING WITH JARED KUSHNER.

136
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:58,051
THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING

137
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,352
GOOD FOR BLACK AMERICA STHAT

138
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:01,221
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?

139
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,357

140
00:06:04,357 --> 00:06:08,928

141
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:11,664
IF YOU ARE MAKE LESS THAN $15 AN

AND THEY WANT TO CUT HEALTH

144
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,206
CARE.

145
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:22,775
>> Laura: HOW DID BARACK OBAMA

146
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:23,843
CHANGE THAT?

147
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,211
>> WELL, HE DIDN'T CHANGE IT

148
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:26,446
SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH.

149
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,815
THE FACT IS UNEMPLOYMENT 10%

150
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:31,184
DOWN TO 5%.

151
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,953
>> Laura: NOW IT'S AT A RECORD

152
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:34,254
LOW.

153
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:37,257
THE ATLANTIC HEADLINE ON THIS.

154
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,959
HOW BARACK OBAMA FAILED

155
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,527
AMERICANS.

156
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:43,296
THE COUNTRY'S FIRST BLACK

157
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:45,665
PRESIDENT NEVER PURSUED POLICIES

158
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:51,204
TO CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP.

159
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:55,308

UP.

162
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:02,515
I THINK THERE IS A LOT YOU CAN

163
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:04,117
DO WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND WORK

164
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:05,952
WITH HIM ON PRISON REFORM AND

165
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,654
OTHER ISSUES.

166
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,756
I THINK THESE NFL PLAYERS COULD

167
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:10,690
WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT.

168
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,894
>> WELL, LAURA, WHEN YOU LOCK

>>>> Laura: THAT'S NOT JUST HIM.

171
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,335
THAT'S BEEN DONE FOR DECADES.

172
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:26,039
>> THEN YOU FREE THEM UP.

173
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,709
OPIOIDS ARE A HEALTH CRISIS.

174
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:34,280

WHAT HAPPENED?

179
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,926
>> HE CHANGED.

180
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:54,267
HE IS A GUY WHO LOOKED AT

181
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,635
MARCHES IN VIRGINIA.

182
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:56,269
HE CHANGED.

183
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,270
I DIDN'T CHANGE.

184
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,705
