babs girl this is not good barbra streisand recently revealed that she had two clones made of samantha her deceased Colt on duty Lola pup whatever it is she calls them her refurbished dogs anyone want to clue her in on what refurbished means if they were refurbished that would be her original dog Samantha zombified frisking around her mansion like a walking dead dog but that would be ultra inconvenient because then she would have chunks of fur falling everywhere and goodness knows dog hair on your Chanel blazer is enough of a problem already anyway Peeta is rightfully upset about this this might be the one time in history that I'm actually siding with Peeta I love animals I love dogs but some animals that just taste really good and I love fur I'll never ever quit it I think it was Pamela Anderson who first made those PETA ads famous the ads that say I'd rather go naked than wear fur yeah well if I had Pamela Anderson's body I'd probably rather go naked as well anyway PETA released a very poignant and reasonable response surprisingly their spokesperson Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement animals personalities quirks and very essence simply cannot be replicated and when you consider that millions of wonderful adoptable dogs are languishing in animal shelters every year or dying in terrifying ways when abandoned you realize that cloning adds to the homeless animal population crisis so I totally get that now obviously this whole cloning issue involves a much larger conversation pertaining to cultural and moral ramifications and even biblical ramifications if you believe in that of cloning there is a very thin line between cloning organs and replicating or growing cells to save lives and cloning actual animals or human beings it kind of gives me that strange feeling about playing God and that makes me really uneasy it's also highly evocative of Stephen King's Pet Sematary and I am so not cool with that so but let us know your thoughts I'm really interested what do you think about cloning your four-legged furry friends or winged friends or whatever would you be happy to have mittens 2.0 or is it too futuristic for you let us know thanks for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us over here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.fafsa.ed.gov
