1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,509
WOMEN AT A WOMEN'S ONLY
SCREENING OF WONDER WOMEN IN

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:09,910
BELGIUM WERE GIVEN GIFT BASKETS
OF CLEANING SUPPLIES, DIET PILL

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,860
PAMPHLETS AND CHOCOLATE IN A
MOVE THAT EITHER COMPLETELY

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,609
MISSED THE POINT OF A FEMALE
LEAD SUPERHERO MOVIE,

5
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,310
OR IS WAS JUST PLAINLY SEXIST.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,920
ATTENDEES AT A WOMAN ONLY JUNE 6
SCREENING AT THE FILL AND A

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,919
BELGIUM THEATER REPORTEDLY
RECEIVED BAGS.

8
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:36,090
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE INCREDIBLE
GIFT BASKETS AT THAT

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,490
SOME OF THAT STUFF IS FINE.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,640
THE NOT SHOWS.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,840
WHO DOESN'T WANT NOT JUST?

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,271
VALID POINT THAT THE SQUEEGEE
IS USEFUL.

13
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:50,240
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN INNER
CAR.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,380
A WOMAN'S MAGAZINE, DIET
PILL -

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,380
QUINOA.

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,380
ITíS HEALTHY.

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,780
THE THEATER IS MAINTAINING
THAT THE ITEMS WERE JUST

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,830
PRODUCTS FROM THE THEATER
SPONSORS AND THAT THEY

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,630
CERTAINLY WERENíT INTENDED TO CAUSE
OFFENSE.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,489
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE
INTENDED TO DO SO, THEY

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,150
SHOULD'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:14,230
1ST OF ALL, I DON'T EVEN CARE
THAT THE MOVIE WAS WONDER WOMAN.

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,230
AMAZING.

24
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,230
AGREED.

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,230
I DONíT EVEN CARE THAT THE MOVIE
WAS WONDER WOMAN.

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,590
I THINK IF YOU ARE GIVING GIFT
BASKETS TO WOMEN AND YOU

27
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,760
ARE INCLUDING CLEANING SUPPLIES
AND DIET PILL PAMPHLETS AND

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,100
CHOCOLATE, YOU CAN REALLY GO F
YOURSELF.

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,900
I THINK THE LARGER PROBLEM
HERE IS WHY IS ONE OF ONE

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:36,020
OF YOUR SPONSORS AT DIET PILL
MANUFACTURER?

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,940
THINK THEN IS SPONSORING IT.

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,700
THINK THEN IS THE PROTEIN
BAR, RIGHT?

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,729
THEY MAKE PROTEIN BARS.

34
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,080
IS NOT SPECIFICALLY

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,200
I'M FINE WITH PROTEIN BARS
BUT DIET PILLS?

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,080
DIET PILL PAMPHLETS, NOT
OKAY.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,360
AND THEN HAVING THESE PEOPLE ñ
PICTURES OF WOMEN ON THE

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,130
FRONT LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY THE
MAGAZINE AND ALL OF THAT

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,100
TOTALLY GOES AGAINST WHAT WONDER
WOMAN STANDS FOR.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,510
JOHN AND I WERE TALKING ON
THINK TANK ABOUT HOW DIRECTOR

41
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,590
PATTY JENKINS PURPOSEFULLY
SHOWED THE WOMEN'S WRINKLES

42
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,800
AND SHOWED HOW GOOD DOES THE IG
GOING SO WE COULD MOVE AWAY

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,860
FROM THE MILL CASE AND MILL
EXPECTATIONS OF WOMEN AND THEN

44
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,630
THEY GIVE THIS GIFT BASKET THAT
COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT THAT

45
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,860
I'VE GOTTEN A FEW GIFT BAGS
AND MOVIE PREMIERES AND

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,920
JUST MOVIES THEY DIDN'T
INCLUDE CLEANING SUPPLIES AND

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,950
CHOCOLATE THAT USUALLY IT IS
PROMOTIONAL THING, SUGAR A

48
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,510
STICKER IN COUPON FOR POPCORN.

49
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,040
THIS IS A RIDICULOUS BAG AND TO
SAY WE DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT

50
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,690
WAY, IT IS NOT EASY TO BUY.

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,400
IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE A
GIFT BAG AT A MOVIE

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
SCREENING, GIVE A GIFT BAG OF
POPCORN.

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,750
EVERYBODY WANTS THAT.

54
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,650
YEAH, I DON'T EVEN CARE THAT
IT WAS WONDER WOMAN THAT

55
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,280
I CARE THAT IT WAS WONDER
WOMAN BECAUSE THE POINT OF

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,260
THIS MOVIE LIKE YOU MENTIONED IS
NOT THE FOCUS ON

57
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,220
TRADITIONAL GENDER NORMS.

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,150
WONDER WOMAN IS SPECIAL BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT

59
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,150
THOSE THINGS.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,690
SHE IS ABLE TO BE WONDERFUL AND
POSITIVE AND STRONG AND

61
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,950
EMPOWERED AND IT JUST KIND OF
FLIES IN THE FACE OF THAT TALK

62
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,940
MY POINT IS 100% AGREE WITH
YOU, BUT MY POINT IS EVEN IF IT

63
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,030
WERE BATMAN OR SAUSAGE PARTY OR
WHATEVER MOVIE IT WAS

64
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,030
EZRA MOVIE JOHN.

65
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,030
I KNOW THE

66
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,940
IF THEY HAD GIFT BASKETS THAT
WERE MEANT WOMEN, CLEANING

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,459
SUPPLIES, CHOCOLATE AND DIET
PILL PAMPHLETS I WOULD

68
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,739
STILL BE PISTON THINK IT WAS
STEREOTYPICAL AND SEXIST OUT

69
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,890
AND THE CHOCOLATES ARE FINE
DIETS VIDEO GOING INTO A MOVIE.

70
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,300
THEIR PMS STEREOTYPES AT THE

71
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,350
THAT'S A COMPONENT BUT I LIKE
CHOCOLATE I WOULD'VE TAKEN

72
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,840
A TAG OF CHOCOLATE I DON'T WANT
DIET PILLS THAT

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,120
IS A DIFFERENT CONTEXT.

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,879
YEAH, YEAH THAT BUT IF A
MOVIE THEATER HAS A SPONSOR

75
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,131
THAT IS A CHOCOLATE
MANUFACTURER, THAT

76
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:07,120
NATURALLY MAKES MORE SENSE THAN
WITH GOD DIET PILL THAT

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,930
IF IT WAS JUST CHOCOLATE
AND POPCORN AND NOT JUST,

78
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,670
DELEGATE THE NODULES, I WOULD BE
LIKE TOTALLY COOL.

79
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,329
I WISH I HAD THAT IN MY WONDER
WOMAN MOVIE SCREENING.

80
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,310
I'LL TAKE A SQUEEGEE TO DUCK

81
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,120
KNOW WHEN YOU ADD IN
EVERYTHING ELSE AND THINGS

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,880
ARE PUT INTO CONTEXT AND YOU CAN
LOOK INTO THE IMPLICATIONS

83
00:04:23,880 --> 00:00:00,000
THEIR LITTLE BIT MORE.
