1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:00,487
COMEY.

2
00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:02,823
SIX MONTHS AFTER CLAPPER TALKED

3
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:04,725
ABOUT THE DOSSIER WITH TAPPER,

4
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:07,127
THE ANALYST WAS HIRED BY CNN.

5
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:08,462
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY

6
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:08,762
MUCH.

7
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:09,629
WITH MARKHAM AND YOUR

8
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:10,864
CONGRESSMAN PETER KING WHO SITS

9
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:11,498
ON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

10
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:14,634
COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN GOING

11
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:15,235
ON.

12
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:15,969
CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU

13
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:17,838
HERE WITH US.

14
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:19,473
I WANT TO PLAY JONATHAN TURLEY

15
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:20,107
WHO'S ON THE SHOW A LOT.

16
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:22,676
THIS IS HIM THIS MORNING TALKING

17
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:23,577
ABOUT THE TIMING ON WHAT JAMES

18
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:27,047
CLAPPER HAS SAID.

19
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,682
>> CLAPPER HAS ALREADY ADMITTED

20
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:31,251
THAT HE DID SPEAK WITH CNN.

21
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:32,284
NOW HE IS INSISTING THAT HE

22
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:35,255
DIDN'T SPEAK TO ANY MEDIA UNTIL

23
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:35,989
JANUARY 20TH, BUT HE INDICATED

24
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:39,826
THAT HE SPOKE TO CNN IN EARLY

25
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:40,160
JANUARY.

26
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,362
CNN REPORTED THAT HIGH LEVEL

27
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:42,996
PEOPLE HAD CONFIRMED THIS

28
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:46,233
INFORMATION WITH HIM.

29
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,434
IF ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS

30
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,236
KLAPPER, THEN HE HAS A SERIOUS

31
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:49,569
PROBLEM.

32
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:52,606
HE COULD BE ACCUSED AGAIN OF

33
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:53,039
PERJURY.

34
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,707
>> Martha: WHAT DID HE TELL

35
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:55,108
YOUR COMMITTEE?

36
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:57,844
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           I

37
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:57,878
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           T

38
00:00:57,878 --> 00:00:57,911
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           L

39
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:57,944
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           I

40
00:00:57,944 --> 00:00:57,978
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           E

41
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:58,011
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           C

42
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:59,045
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           E

43
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:00,614
COMMITTEE, ABOUT THE TIMING OF

44
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:00,914
THIS?

45
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:02,215
>> FIRST, HE DENIED EVER

46
00:01:02,215 --> 00:01:03,817
SPEAKING TO CNN ABOUT IT.

47
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,619
BEING INVOLVED IN LEAKING AT

48
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:05,886
ALL.

49
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,587
AND THEN WHEN HE WAS CONFRONTED,

50
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,322
HE SAID HE MAY HAVE SPOKEN TO

51
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:11,625
TAPPER AND IT WAS INCONCLUSIVE.

52
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:12,826
CERTAINLY MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT

53
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:15,595
HE SPOKE TO JAKE TAPPER,

54
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:17,430
SOMEBODY AT CNN, IN EARLY

55
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,764
JANUARY.

56
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:19,099
THAT COMMENT TO ME, IS TOTALLY

57
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:24,304
-- SOMEBODY LIKE THAT SPOKEN TO

58
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:25,806
THE MEDIA, THIS IS ONLY KNOWN BY

59
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:26,373
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.

60
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:29,609
THE WHOLE CONDUCT OF JOHN

61
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,145
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER DURING THAT

62
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,047
PERIOD, THERE WERE LEAKS COMING

63
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,015
FROM EVERYWHERE IN THE INTEL

64
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:36,783
COMMUNITY.

65
00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:38,852
THIS DOSSIER AS JAMES COMEY TOLD

66
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:39,386
THE PRESIDENT, THE

67
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:41,655
PRESIDENT-ELECT AT THE TIME, SEE

68
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:44,257
AND THEN HAD THE DOSSIER, THERE

69
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:45,325
WASN'T ANY EXCUSE TO RELEASE IT,

70
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:46,760
HE WANTED TO GIVE IT TO THE

71
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,228
PRESIDENT-ELECT SO HE WOULD BE

72
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:49,095
AWARE WHAT'S IN IT.

73
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:51,565
A DAY OR TWO AGO OR THREE DAYS,

74
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:54,634
CERTAINLY CNN IS GOING WITH IT.

75
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,036
TURNS OUT NOW THAT CLAPPER DID

76
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:57,437
TALK TO JAKE TAPPER DURING THAT

77
00:01:57,437 --> 00:01:58,638
PERIOD SO I THINK THERE IS A

78
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,540
REAL PERJURY ISSUE.

79
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,444
A WHOLE ISSUE OF LEAKS IN THE

80
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:05,045
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

81
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:05,946
>> Martha: WILL YOU ASK HIM TO

82
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:07,113
COME BACK TO CLARIFY THESE

83
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:08,815
THINGS?

84
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:10,183
>> WE MAY NOW.

85
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:13,987
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THIS IS

86
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:15,121
GOING TO BE SENT I BELIEVE TO

87
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:15,989
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

88
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:16,656
THEY SHOULD LOOK AT IT.

89
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:19,025
IT'S REALLY UP FOR THEM.

90
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:19,793
THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE TO CLARIFY

91
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:21,761
IT IF YOU WANTED TO.

92
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:24,030
WHEN HE WAS SHOWING IT, THE

93
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,031
DIRECT RELATION CAME BACK AND HE

94
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:27,234
SEEMED TO BE CONFUSED.

95
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,902
BUT RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS WE ARE

96
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:31,805
CONCERNED, OUR REPORT IS DONE.

97
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:32,806
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE

98
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:33,240
IT.

99
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,774
I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD LOOK AT IT

100
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:36,710
CAREFULLY AND PROBABLY TAKE

101
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,043
ACTION.

102
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:38,879
>> Martha: THERE IS A COUPLE

103
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,180
OF DISCREPANCIES TOO IN THE

104
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,414
STORY.

105
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,382
HERE'S WHAT THE CNN REPORT SAID

106
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:43,884
IN JANUARY 12TH WHEN THEY BROKE

107
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,418
THE STORY AND WE KNOW JAMES

108
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:46,019
COMEY SAID WHEN HE WAS

109
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,855
INTERVIEWED FOR THE BOOK THAT HE

110
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:50,991
KNEW THAT CNN WAS LOOKING FOR A

111
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:52,492
NEWS HOOK IN ORDER TO START

112
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:53,593
WRITING ABOUT THE DOSSIER

113
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:56,396
BECAUSE THERE WAS SORT OF

114
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:57,030
GENERALLY KNOWN THERE WAS

115
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,031
SOMETHING OUT THERE.

116
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,399
BUT ONCE THEY SAT DOWN WITH THE

117
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,300
PRESIDENT AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT

118
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,768
IT, THAT GAVE THEM THE LEAK THAT

119
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:04,104
THEY NEEDED.

120
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:07,407
THEY SAID THE ALLEGATIONS WERE

121
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:08,775
PRESENTED IN A TWO PAGE SYNOPSIS

122
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,176
APPENDED ON A REPORT ON RUSSIAN

123
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:11,811
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016

124
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:12,412
ELECTION.

125
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:14,014
THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN THE CNN

126
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:14,347
REPORT.

127
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:16,616
NOW WATCH HOW IT IS WITH

128
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:17,017
BRET BAIER.

129
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:18,485
>> CNN REPORTED AT THE TIME YOU

130
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,820
HANDED A TWO PAGE EXECUTIVE

131
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,055
SUMMARY FROM THE DOSSIER OVER TO

132
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:22,322
HIM.

133
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:23,690
>> I DID NOT.

134
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,357
>> DID NOT.

135
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:25,191
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU MAKE

136
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:26,559
OF THAT?

137
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,395
>> IT SEEMS TO ME THESE GUYS

138
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:29,462
NEED TO GET THEIR STORIES

139
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:29,829
STRAIGHT.

140
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,033
THAT AGAIN, TO ME THAT WHOLE

141
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,235
INTERVIEW WITH BRET BAIER BY THE

142
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,202
WAY IT IS AMAZING BECAUSE COMEY

143
00:03:36,202 --> 00:03:38,638
WAS SAYING THINGS I KNOW IS NOT

144
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:38,939
TRUE.

145
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:39,940
CONTRADICTING THINGS HE SAID

146
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,273
BEFORE.

147
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:42,409
ALSO HIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE.

148
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:43,209
THE CONFUSION.

149
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,611
WHETHER IT IS HIM.

150
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:45,979
WHETHER IT IS MUSIC.

151
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,781
WHETHER IT IS SOMEBODY AT CNN.

152
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,783
THE FACT IS THIS AS A WHOLE DARK

153
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:50,951
PERIOD IN AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE

154
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:53,320
UNIT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN

155
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,989
DECEMBER 6TH AND JANUARY 20TH,

156
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:56,623
IT'S REALLY SHAMEFUL.

157
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:57,691
HALF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY,

158
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:00,827
AND I PUT BRENNAN AND CLAPPER IN

159
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:02,529
THE CENTER OF THAT.

160
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:03,263
COMEY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS

161
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:04,464
WHOLE ROLE IS IN ALL OF THIS.

162
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:09,502
BUT I VIEW VERY SPECTACLE OF

163
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:10,070
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER.

164
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,940
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK THE IG

165
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,241
WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?

166
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:16,709
>> ALL I KNOW, THE IG, DOES A

167
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,012
GREAT JOB.

168
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:20,647
CERTAINLY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB

169
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:21,180
WITH ANDREW MCCADE.

170
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,817
HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO IT.

171
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:24,918
I THINK THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,

172
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:25,618
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

173
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:27,887
LOOK AT IT TO ME WHEN IT COMES

174
00:04:27,887 --> 00:00:00,000
TO THAT CLEAR CONTRADICTION IN
