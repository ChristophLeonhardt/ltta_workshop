so I had to get my Indian visa today because I have a flight that goes out of Sunday I ran out of pages in my passport I use all my visa pages up basically I came here at about 1:00 p.m. I now have pages it's been literally less than two hours our counter is the busiest counter in the nation the passport agencies are basically for people traveling within 14 days or need to submit their passport for a visa for within 28 days so we really seen people with short turnarounds I just got my you SMS graduation so I was here to get my passport today so I can stop flying I'm a flight attendant I wasn't thinking it was possible but then I found out online that it's possible not really excited I've lost it there are other services that I saw with private companies I guess the charge like crazy amounts of money we've been like $600 for a passport that renewals 110 dollars plus the 16 all that's good I fee would be hundred and seventy dollars I didn't know what to expect I had an appointment for 8 o'clock and there was a line around the corner when I got here at 7:30 so that I wasn't expecting we measure the productivity of our employees including timing how quickly they can accomplish a task when we time the people at the New York office we can't use them in our average because they work so much faster and more efficiently than anywhere else in our 26 counter agencies that we would skew the statistics nobody else could keep up I'm about to go get lunch satisfying that I can go to India it's been as amazing as possible it's change your opinion about the renaming actually it's funny that you mentioned that because I was thinking that today it has revolutionized my understanding of government agencies
