all of this sets the stage for some very bad stuff if Donald Trump loses now Donald Trump Donald Trump may not lose maybe Donald Trump wins maybe Donald Trump pulls a last rabbit out of that out of that giant hat and suddenly he does a great debate he comes back and he wouldn't but let's assume for a second that Donald Trump loses over the last couple days we talked yesterday about sean hannity going after megyn kelly and megyn kelly segment Sean Hannity was flacking for Trump which clearly is true and and today megyn kelly and sean hannity sort of made up they tweeted out a picture of themselves together saying we're Irish it's complicated hashtag friends good good okay look good for whatever it's worth that that's I'm glad that that's happening I think that it is better that we all get along because after this election cycle we're all gonna have to get along Chuck Todd asked some questions he says you know if Trump has another bad debate the GOP could publicly split there could be a bunch of people who sort of walk away from from Donald Trump if he has another bad debate what do they feel like will change the dynamic of the race especially if you're Donald Trump well I think if you're Donald Trump just any normalised debate is going to at least stop you know stop Clinton's momentum a little bit but I think it's he listened to the subtle signals that congressional Republicans were sending yesterday few blind quotes here there you heard if Donald Trump doesn't have a good night on Sunday and it's an it's more so if it's similar to the first debate then you may start seeing the down ballot exodus in some form is it is it just candidates proactively running away whatever it is but you set you you now have the sense that Trump said and we've been here before with him but one of these do-or-die moments with the Republican Party with the McConnell where if it's if it's if it's a debate performance like the first night it may be unrecoverable and you may see the party publicly split okay well I don't know the party's gonna publicly split I think they'll hold it together through the election but it does raise the question what happens if Trump loses after all of this is over now one of the this bit this election has basically come down to four people on the on the right you know that is come down to and I discussed this at length yesterday on the podcast but this has come down to I think in the end of basic question do you think this is the last election or do you not think this the last election do you think that there's a possibility the Republicans come back and win in four years with someone who's better than Donald Trump or do you sacrifice that possibility in favor of Trump is the best we can do and we better get it now because otherwise we're totally screwed Hillary's president and she ruins everything and there's no way Republicans ever get elected again and colds are sort of articulates this perspective last night she says this election is the end of Western civilization if it goes the wrong way I'm not really interested in day-to-day politics but this is as you say bigger than dated I've mostly written you know the truth about Jill McCarthy the truth about Darwinism that sort of saying not not particularly involved in elections but this this will determine the survival of Western civilization and it is it is because of because of cultures and demographics will those are people bringing particular cultures with them it's it's taken centuries to create the freest most prosperous fairest societies in the world and there have been lots of studies about this as you probably know out of especially Samuel Huntington some professors at Harvard UCLA you never hear about about this so that the left can go on persuading Americans and I suppose Canadians and British and so on that American culture is the worst culture in the world and sooner we replace ourselves the better off we are we are we are somehow oppressing you know the throngs of the third world that are now being brought in to replace us okay so I have sympathy for the argument that multicultural is not sympathy I agree with the argument that multiculturalism is a blight on Western civilization because if you have cultures that are posed Western civilization that's not a good thing that's a bad thing however the idea that Hillary Clinton's election is going to end at all that's really the you know that's that's really the break point and I understand both sides I understand people who say that it's going to end it all but I've heard that every four years my entire life in four years we'll hear it again and all of the I think a lot of the people who say the Western civilization is over you might as well pack up shop and go home America is done it's not America anymore we have a lot of people I respect believe this none of them will be quitting their commentariat jobs on November 9th if Donald Trump loses right they'll all stick around so even they don't believe this deep down in their heart they believe that there's still a fighting chance and they have a chance to make a difference if they didn't believe that I assume they would quit and go off to the mountain somewhere and prepare for the bunker mentality I don't think that's what's going to happen I think everyone really knows that November 9th yes things could be worse things could always be worse Hillary Clinton could be an awful awful president but that does not absolve us of our duty to fight back and it does not mean that we don't have a chance of winning if we do fight back and that is what I'm hoping for November 9th if things go downhill if things go downhill there's only one thing that's gonna guarantee the dominance of left 4 years from now because let's face it if Hillary Clinton's elected she's gonna be unpopular nobody likes her now she stinks she's awful at everything she touches she's unpopular she's unlikable she's annoying she's corrupt she's greedy she's selfish she's nasty all these things are true the idea that she's gonna be some sort of world-beating president with a Republican Congress I just don't buy it I don't see it what I see is a woman who's gonna be very deeply unpopular from the first day she steps into office will remain unpopular or likely just thanks to the vicissitudes of the economy to undergo some sort of brutal recession in the near future because the cycle is usually you know every 10 years there's a recession you know there was one in 2000 there was one in 2008 there was one in 1991 every eight to ten years there's a recession we're due so that means that if it hits during Hillary Clinton's cycle well she's well she's you know president then that hurts her too so you know I think that there's there's a lot to be optimistic about even if Hillary Clinton is elected president but that's gonna require us to do one thing and what that's gonna require us to do is unify and stop blaming each other so I can already see everybody is getting set to blame each other after this election cycle and listen I've been a part of it and I apologize for having been a part of it I think that everybody's been a part of the kind of blame each other for the Trump phenomenon blaming people for voting stupidly in the primaries look I think people voted wrong in the primaries I'm not gonna lie about that but I understand why people voted for Trump in the primaries they were angry Trump was the avatar of that anger Trump was the only person on stage who seemed to be reflecting that anger back at them he was the only one who seemed to be fighting the kind of political incorrectness that they people see in the culture he seemed like the only one who was willing to say things that he ticked off the right people like I get that I get the rationales I don't agree with them I think they're wrong I understand the rationales if we're gonna move to there forward after this election cycle the people who didn't vote for Trump and the people who voted for Trump and the people who are reluctant ly voted for Trump we're all gonna have to stand together to oppose Hillary Clinton and hopefully come up with somebody who's better next time that first requires us to acknowledge that this is Donald Trump's fault we need someone better next time we can't have another Donald Trump this is on Trump if Trump loses to Hillary Clinton a deeply flawed candidate the most deeply flawed candidate of my lifetime if Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton that's not on me that's not on Sean Hannity that's not on the people who it's not even on Laura Ingraham who I think you know really pushed him in an unfair way it's not on any of those people in the end it's only on one person and that is Donald Trump because it's the candidates it's the candidates job to garner support his job is to earn my vote if he didn't earn my vote he didn't do his job my job is not to vote for him my job is to be conservative and vote for the candidate who I feel not only best reflects the principles but the person who is best capable of forwarding those principles so when we talk about Republican unity everybody's gonna have to look inside their own house everybody's gonna have to look back at themselves and say what did we do to bring ourselves to this sort of impasse I think a lot of the Trump voters gonna have to look and say did we make the most intelligent decision to channel our anger our understandable anger at the status quo a feeling that Congress doesn't do anything the Republicans sellout did we do the best thing by pushing somebody who is a career Democrat who doesn't know anything about policy and just says absurd things because he's famous was that the wisest decision conservatives are gonna have to stop acting as though every single battle is the end of the Republic because it's that mentality that leads to the idea you gotta back the guy the the only one who can win the one who's gonna punch the hardest you gotta back the guy who's going to forestall the apocalypse even if he is the second worst thing to the apocalypse not everything is the apocalypse things are bad things are really bad I'm not biessing you that doesn't mean that that every single moment is the moment when America is over it isn't okay America is getting worse we're on the wrong path and yes we're headed toward a cliff and that cliff is coming but we're not quite over the cliff yet if we were over the cliff there would be no reason for me to do the podcast or for you to listen okay that's what conservatives have to do we need to recognize that yes our principles are right but we don't have to suggest that every single hill is the hill where there are public ties we have to be willing to die on every hill but we can't we can't give up ground to the left but we have to stop with the crisis mentality that suggests that every single battle is the end of the Republic and so if we lose we're all going to die and and let's just get the guy who can win even if he doesn't represent us meanwhile in the establishment which i think is largely responsible for the rise of Trump by not listening to its own base by scorning its own base by presenting everything was hunky-dory by caving to Democrats by making deals they're gonna have to start listening to the outrage of the American public and they're gonna have to start recognizing that go along to get along because things are basically okay isn't accurate for the vast majority of Americans we don't think things are okay and conservatives don't think that and Trump voters don't think that nobody thinks that so that's all stuff that we have to do all of us we all have to look into our own houses and figure and clean up our own houses but we also have to have sympathy for people who are trying to clean up their house and we all have to acknowledge that we're trying to move in the right direction we're gonna need some unity after this election is over no matter which way it goes but that's particularly true if Trump loses we're gonna have to have a unified movement so we can come back in four years and we also have to recognize something if we just put it on the candidate we're gonna be better off John McCain lost in 2008 because he wasn't a good candidate in 2010 Republicans United and they elected a Republican Congress now the Republican Congress didn't do enough to do what we wanted them to do but that was it victory in 2014 when a sweeping victory after recognizing Mitt Romney was not the right guy Mitt Romney did not do a good job as a candidate we can either sit around smacking each other and you know continue to waste our efforts in the House and the Senate in 2018 if Trump loses or we can recognize that we're still in the fight of our lives here and the Donald Trump was not the right guy to lead us forward and the truth is hard to find the right guy to lead us forward it's hard to find a leader because human beings are inherently flawed all of them including Ronald Reagan everybody is flawed we tend to overlook their flaws if they win but you know that that it's harder to find the presidential candidate than it is to win Congress but or to unify around Republican basic ideology ticket that's what we ought to be doing we ought to be a unifying around the ideology recognize our own flaws try to fix those for the future get rid of the crisis mentality for conservatives or at least minimize it a little bit recognize that there is a crisis if you're somebody in the establishment and if you're a trump supporter if you're somebody who voted Trump to burn it all down recognize that burn it all down is a responsible response to the system the proper response to the system is to destroy the parts of it that are bad and maintain the parts of it that are good the guy who just pledges to go in there and break everything up with a hammer is probably the least likely guy to actually do it and by the way if he does destroy everything with a hammer then you're left with nothing
