so yesterday on the mailbag somebody asked me why I liked old movies better than newer movies and I said it was the language that they was there was more you know exposition more dialogue people talked more they cared about what they talked and I just want to tell an actual true story something that actually happened to me that kind of illustrates how this has changed and I want to begin by saying just pointing out that I am a person who doesn't get very angry very much I was an angry young man I kind of got out of that rose out of that and now I really get angry at anybody because I sort of have an understanding what my life is about my life is about making things it's about building things that are that I think are beautiful and convey wisdom and Worth and entertainment and as long as I'm doing that I'm happy and the only time I ever really get angry at somebody if it's not outside of you know kind of personal things or somebody attacks my my friends or something but outside of that the only time I really get angry is when somebody gets in my way of doing what I do which is very rare because I don't let people get in my way of doing what I do but when this happens we have a joke in my house my family that you know whenever I get angry at anybody they die a violent death this is not because I go out and kill them this is because the e God sends an angel of the Lord to strike them down in my behalf so ten years ago and I'm a shock to realize it's been ten years I wrote a movie called one missed call and I always joke about one missed call it was a remake of a Japanese horror film about a haunted cellphone you got a call on your cell phone from a ghost and then it you died a week later you died it's like the ring I I called it the ringtone I wanted to make I made a joke in the script about it being the ringtone that they forced me to cut out and this is one of the things about the script that that the movie the movie gets it has a zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes it is and it won that year's award for the worst movie ever made I maintain it deserves about a 16% but the reason it came out so badly is because everybody made a different movie the director was a French artiste and he wanted to make a French artiste movie filled with grotesque violence that said something about society and the producers wanted to make a good you know kind of scare the teenagers movie that delivered on their investment which by the way it did it was that the movie was a hit that actually was number 5 that weekend and made a lot of made its investment back many many times over so they they actually succeeded I who don't really like I took this job because I thought it was a good deal for me both economically and for fun which is one of the big reasons I work is for fun and I wanted to write a kind of take off a satire a la scream on these movies that I call one by one movies movies where somebody the whole plot is that each people person dies one after another and so I wrote what I thought that was this fairly witty script I'm not gonna argue that it was Shakespeare was what it was it was what it was supposed to be but it was witty it was young people saying witty things kind of making fun of the fact that they were in this move this old-fashioned Japanese horror movie just as the Japanese horror fad was ending so it did include lines like oh you know it's the the ringtone we're in the ringtone and you know first first you hear the ringtone they need all these jokes about the car you know self-referential jokes so I knew that the picture was in trouble one day one of the there were this cast of lovely young people 20 years old and most of them 20-somethings and they wanted to make this kind of serious artiste movie like the director so they they didn't actually see that a lot of the lines in the movies were ironic a lot of little lines in the script were ironic one of these actors was a guy named Johnny Lewis and there's no point in my hiding his name because you you could look it up and you'd see who it was Johnny Lewis is big claim to fame was he was in that FX show Sons of Anarchy and one day Johnny came to me and I was on the set for about a week and he said to me you know this isn't how young people talk and I said Johnny I know it's not how young people talk and remember now I'm like fifty or something like this so it's like I'm not you know I I'm not an authority on how young people thought I said Johnny I know it's not how young people talk it's better it's people saying witty things that are written for them by a writer and so the people go to the movies and they get somebody saying things that they wouldn't know how to say because they're whittier than they are and they enjoy the wit and they and he said yeah but this is not what we would say it's not what young people would say I said Johnny I know it's better than what you would say because young people are kind of in articulate and they don't speak like this and they don't have this level of wit so this will deliver something in terms of entertainment now obviously I'm talking from an old-fashioned perspective I'm talking about the fact that the movies are supposed to be an entertainment made by people who know how to entertain you including writers who know how to write witty dialogue so of course he did what any twenty-year-old actor would do is he went to the producers and producers in Hollywood are largely 50-year old men who are absolutely terrified that they're about to become irrelevant because they won't don't know enough about the youth culture and so the producers came to me with stars in their eyes saying Johnny says that there's a new way a way of doing this it's much more like the way that 20-year old people would talk and I said yes it's true there is a way of doing this is much more like the way 20-year old people will talk but it's not as witty and is interesting and as fun is what I'm doing so of course the writers have no power on set I knew I was gonna lose the argument the minute it started but I thought I'd make my argument and of course they went off and they let Johnny and the other act and the actress who was also in C rewrite the scene and so it became filled with like stuttering and you know dirty words and all this stuff and I have to admit I got angry at Johnny Lewis and I didn't say anything because there was no point I didn't think I could win the fight that I said to my wife you know this guy really ticked me off because now the script is gonna be bad now that the movie is gonna be bad because they're just gonna do this in every scene and there's nothing I can do about I'm not even gonna be on set after this week so that's just the way it goes and they just thought the scene was so much better because it sounds so much more like real kids talking instead of like witty dialogue that was actually communicating with the with the audience four years later Johnny Lewis walked into his 81 year old land lady's room murdered her killed her cat stepped off the roof of the building and fell to his death so the moral of the story is one that the democratization of language has an effect it has some maybe some positive effects but it also has it also tends to cheapen the idea of language as communicating truth it communicates reality but it no longer communicates truth and the second moral of the stories don't piss me off trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Klavan shelf I shouldn't laugh at for Johnny is a different way to go but that's that's the way it goes Michael Duran is gonna come on and talk to us about the Iran deal he wrote a really interesting piece in The Wall Street Journal yesterday I believe it was talking about the Iran deal and whether we should get rid of it or fix it but I want to talk to him about the or n deal all through I'm gonna talk to him about his piece but I also want to explain what the Iran deal is because we keep talking about it and do we know exactly what it is I also just have to have a shout out to a Montecito I lived in Montecito for 15 years I used to joke that my house was immune to natural disasters because it was right next to Oprah Winfrey's house that was really I was two houses down from Oprah Winfrey's estate now I don't want to make myself some grander than I am her estate is so large that many many houses were you know to two steps away but mine was right down the street from hers yesterday there were these horrible mudslides I think 15 people are missing right where I lived I mean it was exactly where I lived you know and so many of my friends who have been had to move or been evacuated here is Oprah they had a picture of Oprah just outside her house has cut number five this this was I mean this is yards away from where I lived house it's unbelievable that is my neighbor was my neighborhood and so I used to joke that Oprah was protecting me but it turns out I was protecting Oprah when I moved away the veil of protection was lifted we moved down here because I was commuting so much and one of the things that was really interesting when we came down here is that we I love my house in LA it's just a lovely house but I remember there was one room I won't go into this I don't get too personal but it was one room who's really bothering me and I thought there's something about this room that is just aesthetically not quite right and my wife went out and she got blinds for the windows and suddenly I thought oh that was it that was it

she made this speech at the gold Globes and we'll play again this thing and they made a big big fuss about it because they say oh she's running for president but here was the end of the speech that people kind of reacted to because we all know that the press is under siege these days but we also know that it is the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice to victims and secrets and lies I want to say that I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times which brings me to this what I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have so a lot of conservatives picked on this because she said speaking your truth and there is no such thing in a way as your truth I mean there is your truth and how you're experiencing life I suppose but there's truth and there's not truth and she starts out in cow towing to the press he starts out by saying the press is looking for absolute truth now let's talk about this for a minute because I it's been the thing that I've been trying to get to all week about the fact that I think the press is doing exactly the opposite I think the press is creating a fantasy it's not just fake news it's fantasy news and in fact the whole idea of fake news has played into this fantasy has helped is it was a ploy a strategy for creating this fantasy and protecting this fantasy and part of this grows up you know there's a lot of strains of thought that go into this way of looking at language and a way of looking at truth but a lot of it starts with the the fall of the Soviet Union after and and the destruction of Europe after World War Two a lot of these post modernists who came along guys like Paul de man and Jacques Derrida and even if you go before them to Heidegger the philosopher Heidegger would argue that there was no such thing is truth outside of the context in which the truth was spoken now this is a novelistic common place for people like me who write novels every character speaks he may speak the truth but he also is speaking out of his own life and that's what all of Shakespeare is about Shakespeare each character says something different approaches the truth in a different way and that's how you know his character and you get an overall picture of the truth from all the different characters speaking in different ways now what's really interesting about Heidegger as Heidegger was a Nazi supporter and people who were followers of the philosopher Heidegger try to explain this away it's also interesting that Paul Daman one of the founders of the post modernist movement a guy who sort of attacked language and with Derry da after him sort of said that language cannot convey anything but itself essentially that in other words language doesn't convey an outer truth you can't get beyond the text the text is always self referential you know and I don't want to I don't get into the deep weeds about it but the point is that we're never really talking about the outside world the outside world doesn't have a reality that can be conveyed through language and one of the things that's interesting about Paul Daman is after he died it came out that he was a collaborator with the Nazis and he wrote anti-semitic articles that help the Nazis along and a lot of the post modernists including dairy dog began making excuses for him I was always very hard to tell what Dahl was saying because he wrote in this completely obscure style but still they were making an obscure excuses for me I remember saying to a friend of mine who was a Yale PhD and he had studied under Daman and he was he would defend him on and I said you know the fact that Daman wrote these anti-semitic nazi pieces and then tried to make the argument that language doesn't matter speaks to me of a moral universe it means that he knows that he violated the moral he violated the moral code of God face basically and he's now trying to prove that it doesn't exist which is what people do when they sin if you sin you can do one of two things you can say I made a mistake I repent let me go forward and do better that's one thing you can do and then you can do it 97% of people do which is explain to yourself for the rest of your life why what you did wasn't so bad and the world is really different than everybody says it is and if only understood the world you would see that your sin doesn't exist I mean that is what most people do that's how the devil gets you he doesn't get you when you sin because everybody sins he gets you when you explain away your sin by saying that the world is different than in fact it is and a lot of this played into I think the conscience of the post modernists and the relativists especially after the Soviet Union fell apart after communism failed because they had rested a lot of their hopes in this leftism that was going to save the world and has now been shown to be a failure leftism is a failure socialism is a failure communism communism is a failure it doesn't work it doesn't do what it's going to say what it says it's going to do it never has it never will it's not that it hasn't been done right it that the philosophy itself is wrong embedded in this philosophy and this leftist philosophy is the elevation of the working man over the elites and in some ways this is a good thing and it's tied up with the treatment of black people it's elevating black people in the arts and in the way we look at the world and it's saying this is an experience to that the world is not just about what Prince Hamlet says it's also about with the little guy that nobody writes about says it you know some of the American Great American tragedies of this post-war era including the Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller he's an ordinary man he's a Salesman but Arthur Miller saying this is a tragedy tragedies aren't just about Kings and the wife in Death of a Salesman says attention must be paid to such a man and so it is a the democratization of tragedy the democratization of language the idea that language should that the language of ordinary people is important as well as the language of sophisticates the problem with this now everything comes with a price right so the good thing about this is it reminds us that everybody's life is not an elevated sophisticated elite life in these lives are just as important as any other that's a very good Christian principle but everything comes at a price and the price is that language becomes devalued so that in other words if you're an educated person you're going to speak better more clearly more in a more sophisticated more complex way than if you're not an educated people a lot of the comedy and Shakespeare come from the fact that ill educated people don't string their sentences together very well and so you are devaluing language and you're devaluing languages capability of transmitting the truth I always talk about the comedian oh my gosh what was his name the seven things you can't say on radio let me look it up who's a famous comedian things George Carlin thanks guys it was George Carlin and everybody loves this routine because he would come out and just repeat these curse words over and over and over again and string them together the seven curse words just the most foul curse words you can imagine and he was making fun of the fact that we consider these things obscene why are they obscene they're just sounds they're just noises they're just words it's a very funny routine but it's utterly wrong because language does transmit what we mean when I say a tree we both know what a tree looks like we both have the same image of a tree in our minds it's not it's an agreed-upon tool that we use to transmit reality so when I use a foul word I actually am communicating something that we both understand and saying it doesn't mean that doesn't stop it from meaning that so when kids today and you listen to them they talk in these four-letter words and they use them offhandedly they are devalue in language and they say well what's the difference it's not dirty it's nothing but that's not true we both know what it means we are both using your we're all using it understanding it to mean something that is grotesque that lowers that that elevates for instance going to the bathroom or meaningless sex / making love and you know doing the more sophisticated things that human beings do this is why because language gets too valued in language as a vehicle for truth gets to value you can then take the next step that the postmodernist took the step of deconstruction and say there is no reality there's only the reality that we agree to this the fact that I say tree and we agree that that means tree is just a contract and so that if we can all agree on a different truth then the world itself will change right that in other words truth is now given no voice whatsoever James d'amour I talked about this is the guy who's who put out a manifesto a Google employee put out a man affair saying that women you know may make different choices that keep them from rising to the top of Technology and he was fired and he is sued Google and some of the stuff that he has said that he says Google is doing is utterly nutso for instance in a section of his lawsuit claiming that Google tries to stifle conservative parenting style the suit reads google furnishes a large number of internal mailing lists catering to employees with alternative lifestyles including furries people who dress up to stuffed animals polygamy transgenderism and plurality for the purpose of discussing sexual topics the only lifestyle that seems to not be openly discussed on Google's internal forms is traditional heterosexual monogamy so they are trying to change the culture by changing what people can say and if you go on and you look at Google now has a fact-checker you know it has a fact-checking thing so if you look something up it tells you the factory it only fact checks us it fact checks the Daily wire in fact checks other conservative sites it does not fact check left-wing sites so the idea that Google is now selling and is selling it very hard is that left-wing leftism is truth leftism is truth and right-wing arees is just a lie it's just an entire lie you know there I'm reading this book about the immigration crisis in Europe and how its destroying Europe and at one point I'm gonna Merkel the Chancellor of Germany who started this who brought all these people these Syrians into the into Europe he said she said to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg this is in the book what could be done to stop European citizens from writing criticisms of our migration policy on Facebook are you working on this she asked him and Zuckerberg said yes he was in fact our friend that project of overt project Veritas our friends over at Project Veritas have put out a new video where they've captured people on Twitter saying that they are shadow banning conservative voices so the people like me don't know that we've been banned we just are still putting stuff out but nobody's reacting to it because they are banning it without letting us know here's just an excerpt of Project Veritas as catching these people on secret video did you shadow bad it is you bent someone but they don't know they've been bad because they keep posting but no one sees their content so they just think that no one's engaging with their content when reality you know what seeing it I don't know keywords are described and then you look kinetic bars all the messages all like the pictures in the book or like stuff that matches like like essentially gonna have servants and or who could be negative it's a bit of mindset it's gonna be like a way of talking do you have access to damn to Twitter oh that classic if like you know people figure out that you're shadowed banning them it's like unethical at Subway now one of the reasons we like Donald Trump and we enjoy him is the Trump is playing the same game they're playing Trump is basically saying oh okay if there's no reality and Trump believes this I think there's if there's no reality then I'm gonna confront your reality with my reality and we enjoy about him is he doesn't care if they call him racist he doesn't call if they call him sexist he just puts forward his alternative point of view which in many cases like a Venn diagram intersects with what conservatives to believe to be the truth now there are people who have there they're clutching their pearls saying oh my god now we're we're just one of them but that this is just politics this is why I don't get too excited about this however however Steven Pinker in a speech that sounded almost exactly like the speech I gave in Silicon Valley at Christmastime Steven Pinker at Harvard he's a Harvard psychologist I've read his books they're really entertaining he put forward this idea that essentially and I've put forward this idea - it's funny a Harvard he's a Harvard professor and I'm just a barefoot teller of tales and yet we're saying the same thing but he put forward this idea that when you keep people from the truth you open up the path toward hatred toward fascism we were talking about this with Sebastian Gorka yesterday that when you won't let people say hey maybe mass immigration is a bad thing then the only people who will say it are Nazis and the Nazis begin to talk sense and that's a very dangerous situation so here is Steven Pinker on a panel as a really wonderful moment where he simply talks about things that are obviously true that no one is allowed to say and then he talks about what it what happens if you're not allowed to say I'm now I will I'll add that part at the end but just listen to the basic common sense that comes out of his mouth so here is a fact that's going to sound regionally controversial but is not and that is that capitalist societies are better than communist ones so if you if you doubt it then just ask yourself the question would I rather live in South Korea or North Korea what I rather live in West Germany in the 1970s or East Germany or in the 1960s so this is not I submit that this is actually not a controversial statement but in the university campuses it is considered it will be considered a flaming Lee radical number two here's another one men and women are are not identical in their life priorities in their sexuality in their in their tastes and interests again this is not controversial to anyone who is even glanced at the data the kind of vocational interest tests of a kind that your high school guidance counselor gave you been given to millions of people and men and women give different answers as to what they want to do for a living and how much time they want to allocate to family versus career and so on but you kind of can't say it I mean someone very famous person on this campus did say it and that we all know what happened to him he's no longer well he is on this campus but no longer in the same office here's a third fact that is just not controversial although it sounds controversial well that is the different ethnic groups commit violent crimes at different rates you can go to the Bureau of Justice Statistics look it up on their website the homicide rate among African Americans is about seven or eight times higher than it is among European Americans and terrorism go to the global terrorist database and you find that worldwide the overwhelming majority of suicide terrorist acts are committed by Islamist extremist groups so as Pinker's point is that if you've been lied to about all these very simple facts men and women are different Islamic Islamists create most terrorist acts blacks commit more murders if if you are not allowed to say these things when you discover them you are in danger of becoming part of the alt-right this is what he's saying he's against the alt-right as I am against the alt-right and he's saying when you find out that women or men are different you might suddenly think that women are inferior if you find out that blacks and whites are different you might suddenly think that racism has a point and that is not that is not truth that is not the truth you know if somebody yelled at me the other day a couple of people yelled at me the other day when I said that when women take over a an industry it's because the industry has become obsolete that men basically move in they create the industry and when they said what a sexist thing to say and I was joking about as it being sexist it's not sexist because it's only feminism that accepts that building and industry is more important than building a human being that building and industry is more important than raising people and nurturing people and teaching people right from wrong that those two things that that somehow building an industry is a bigger deal it's only feminism that accepts that and of course masculine sexism that accepts those things I do not accept those principles and this is what I want to get to what I want to get to is this it is each one of us are warriors in this fight for the truth and each one of us must speak the truth fearlessly even when people call us racist even when it threatens our livelihood even when it threatens a you know and I've been through all of this so I'm not just saying this off the top of my head but even when it threatens our standing in the community we must speak the truth but we mustn't let people we mustn't mistake the truth hatred for the truth we mustn't mistake hatred for the truth it remains true that all of us men and women are made in the image of God and that in loving God we have to also love one another this is basic stuff this is basic Christian religious stuff we must do this and if you are finding the truth if you are speaking the truth you have to speak it through this through this filter of love and if you don't you've ceased to speak the truth at all really you've used the truth in the service of lies so this is the danger the fate we face the mortal hazard that we face but each one of us really has a role to play in doing this hey by the way we're doing the conversation again that's on Tuesday the tell me the 16th maybe the 16th re this Tuesday the 16th this is this

Duran Michael Duran is a senior fellow at the Hudson Indus Institute he specializes in Middle East security issues his latest book Ike's gamble America's rise to dominance in the Middle East is out now it's about President Eisenhower's handling of the 1956 Suez Crisis which is a really really fascinating subject yesterday Michael Duran wrote a piece in The Wall Street Journal that has become really controversial saying that we shouldn't leave the Iran deal it can be fixed and we're going to talk about that Mike it's good to see it hi they could be here let's begin I want to I want to cover this you know one of the things that always bothers me about the news is that people keep talking about these things the Iran deal or something and they don't explain what it is and people sort of kind of feel they know what it is but they don't really so let's begin with it at the very beginning what exactly is this deal that Obama made with the Iranian regime I'll tell you but I have to caveat that by telling you that I'm I'm telling you my truth that's the most important thing Oprah says you can do one of the strange things about the Iran deal is that President Obama didn't tell the truth about it he presented it to the country as an arms control agreement with the with the Iranians and it was certainly that but it was actually much bigger than that it was a reorientation of American policy in the Middle East toward Iran we under the Obama administration the United States aligned with Iran across the across the board and he used the nuclear deal as the device for executing that but he never admitted that his his former officials the echo-chamber or still having an oversized role in our national debate about the Middle East they don't admit that that happened they they pretend that we were continuing to contain Iran and so on so there's my view and then there's what what the Obama Obama i'ts are saying and they're really quite they're really quite contradictory there's there's no consensus about this yet but but the but the content of the deal itself was essentially that Iran could continue to amass nuclear materials as long as they didn't use them is that fair to say yes but they had they had to keep their stockpiles they could continue to suspend centrifuges and to enrich uranium but they had to keep their stockpiles at at a particular level so that they wouldn't have the ability to break out and build a nuclear bomb within about a one-year period different experts differ on about that about the timeframe but so they were given this enrichment they were blessed with an enrichment capability they by the international community as long as they restricted their activities for about a decade and then after a decade the the agreement sunsets and they can go do whatever they want that's the that that's one of the major criticisms of the conservatives of the deal is that the fact that it has sunsets and and what was all this about the money that we were sending them they pallets of money dropped in the dead of night from helicopters I mean what what was that well there we incentivize them to sign the deal by releasing assets that that that had been frozen by international law and and in addition we incentivize them and with regard to the money by settling some disputes between the the the the two of us of some bilateral us Iranian disputes settling them in my view very much in the Iranians favor there were all kinds of hidden concessions to the Iranian side as far as I understand the thing we we we basically recognize Syria as an Iranian sphere of influence and did nothing to to counter the Iranians or for that matter the Russians when they moved to prop up Assad we stopped prosecuting cases to narcotics cases against Hezbollah operatives in in this country in order not to and not to anger his father which is basically his bola is basically a wing of the Revolutionary Guards of of Iran so there were an enormous number of hidden costs to this thing as well so this is something I've never gotten a reasonable answer to what was Obama thinking I mean Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world they hate us they you know talk about death to America all the time their leaders despise us what what brilliant vision did he have I mean I'm assuming you know whenever I asked people of this people about this I start to hear from the crazies who say well Obama's a secret Muslim he was working to build the Caliphate but but surely there must be something that was on his mind I know I'm the perfect guy to explain this to you because I understand Obama's thinking about all of us he's not he's not a Kenyan communist and in this regard and he's not a closeted Muslim he's just an Ivy League professor in terms of his understanding of the world I spent enough time in the Ivy League to be able to to parrot how they you know their their lines about the world he had basically three motivations one was he wanted to go down in history as the guy who ended wars in the Middle East who ended george w bush's Wars number two so that meant we had to pull back from Iraq and the minute you say the minute you say I'm gonna pull American troops out of Iraq we have this problem and that there's I ran right next door which has an outsized influence in Iraq so if you're gonna pull your troops out Iran is gonna start having a major it's gonna start putting Iraq under its thumb what does the United States gonna do is it gonna play its usual role of containing Iran or is it gonna give Iran a pass so in order for Obama to achieve his goal of pulling the troops out of Iraq he had to give her an a pass right there in in Iraq but then he also had to give them pass or at least come to to an agreement on the nuclear question but basically what he did on the nuclear question is he just put it aside for 10 years which was long enough for him to get out to pull back from the Middle East to get the peace that he wanted in Iraq and so on so that's that's factor one factor number two is that Obama seems to have decided that I think a lot of foreign policy experts would agree with him on this that now the real game in the world is in East Asia it's the challenge of China and and we're kind of just throwing you know wasting blood and treasure in the Middle East for no good for no good purpose and then the third thing is what I think you and I would would both laugh at which is that I really do believe that Obama felt that he was he had some kind of special insight into world affairs some kind of factor X you know that he was gonna unlike the Republicans who have this really nasty worldview and which is which which in Obama's mind your worldview drew mine it is it is self-defeating we we create the beast that we say we want to slay and if if we just reach out our hand to these guys like the Iranians that they'll stop fighting with us because we can find a kind of natural equilibrium because we are the problem that's what every Ivy League professor believes that Barack Obama believes that it he believed that he was the Anointed One to come fix it all okay so I'm we're talking to Michael Duran of the Hudson Institute the author of Ike's gamble America's rise to dominance in the Middle East was about the Suez Crisis one of the genuinely fascinating historical subjects so you wrote this piece I said I think you're getting a lot of flack for this I think oh my my friends are very angry okay to explain every now and again the president United States has to rear a defy Obama's Iran deal right he has to say yes the Iranians are in fact holding up their end of the bargain and I think it's today he has to do it again right is that am i right basically it's actually tomorrow and perhaps the next day a little bit confused because what it what we're looking at here is the confluence right now of two legislatively mandated timelines the the Anora timeline and the in these are is inside baseball but every every 90 days in every 180 days by by according to two different led pieces of legislation he has to certify whether Iran is in compliance and whether we should waive or not waive the sanctions on them the gist it's this the sanctions that we put on Iran before the before the nuclear deal are still in place legally the American sanctions and so when he waives them when he waives the sanctions that means we're not applying them but he can decide to reapply them in a moment's notice that's the okay it's the question and you were your contention is that he should not ditch the deal which a lot of people feel he should but he should fix the deal how can the steel be fixed well bear in mind that that I think the deal is an abomination okay right i if if Trump decides tomorrow to tank it it's it's I'm not going to lose any sleep on that at all it's for me it's just a question of tactics I the the question for me is how do we contain Iran and what's the smartest way to go about it and if if if he decides tomorrow to reimpose the sanctions that means what will happen is in effect he's pulling the United States out of the deal so it's we're going into a major confrontation with Iran and and at the same time a major confrontation with our European allies because when we reapply the sanctions it means that we say to European European companies they can't do business with Iran so we go into a major conflict with our European allies and with the Russians and the Chinese as well and in the end into a conflict with the with the Iranians now who in in the US government right now what is in favor of this of this conflict well perhaps Donald Trump if he decides to do that but then none of his advisers not mattis not to us and maybe Mike Pompeo I don't know where I don't we're Pompeo is but Tillerson and madison out there the europeans are not there there you just saw they they I mean very wisely I think you know they went and they met with with the sereth the the the Iranian Foreign Minister tooth under nose at Trump I wish they hadn't done that I was very unwise but they did it and then and then the American press and the Democrats right every so he's gonna he's gonna go into a major conflict with nobody on his side and I just think that's a mistake it's not like it's not like we apply these sanctions and and we and we topple Iran tomorrow we're gonna be in a we're gonna be in an extremely significant conflict which could turn very ugly and you know I was in the White House during the Iraq war just remember just think about the way I look at this is that this legislation that they're trying that they're trying to work on with with corker and Cardin and cotton and so forth the legislation to fix the deal just says basically as a matter of American law these sunsets of the in the nuclear deal are unacceptable the ballistic the intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Iranians are unacceptable that the the levels of uranium enrichment must stay where they are now fixed and if the Iranians move beyond them then we're gonna reimpose sanctions across the board it's sort of a unilateral statement by the United States that if if the Iranians if the Iranians ever move beyond the terms of the deal as we currently understand it then we're gonna reimpose sanctions so you're basically getting rid of the sunset clause getting rid of it according to American law and I look I look at this as as a kind of laying a very a very rational very reasonable basis when you look at this regime a reasonable basis for American policy they can get a lot of support on the left and it can get a lot of support in Europe as as well and that is the better position to take when going into a conflict with it with Iran than to just go and throw the whole thing to the wind and then be blamed I mean you cannot you know you can already imagine how they're gonna everyone is gonna team up to blame Trump on this so I'm thinking about the next the day after and the day after that when things get nasty and we have to call on people to help us perfectly reasonable michael duran

stuff that you can learn that will that you might really be interested in alright you know we've got to go gosh but we ought to do stuff I like before we go well no quick stuff I like since since we're talking about we're talking about the use of language you know many years ago is back in the 90s I got a call from my agent saying they're going to remake all about Eve with Jane Fonda and they were interested in getting my take on the script and I said no and my agent got very upset my said why not I said one they're not going to do it because it's a perfect movie and you can't remake it and the other is I'm not gonna rewrite a perfect script it's a perfect Joseph L mankiewicz is one of the greatest scripts ever written and it is a brilliant brilliant story and so we talked about we were talking about why I liked old movies and it's the use of language and here's a story about an aging Broadway star played by Betty Davis and a young woman and Baxter who infiltrates her world basically in order to replace her and it is about this kind of conniving young woman who moves into an older woman's space and they're all highly literate people and here's a very famous scene with one of the most famous lines in all of movies I started joking when they when they called me up about this I started making jokes about how how do you rewrite this is the great one of the greatest lines ever written how do you rewrite this line for the modern world but if you'll notice it's just the these playwright is teasing the actress played by Betty Davis and then Betty Davis meets the critic played by George Sanders and he comes in with his latest chick on his arm his ladies babe and it's Marilyn Monroe and one of her very first film roles so just listen to the language listen to the repartee as they talk the kids unless you'd like to take a drink up to it I can get a freshman okay you're a Gibson Girl the general atmosphere is very Macbeth ish what has arisen out to happen what is he talking about Macbeth we know you we've seen you like this before is it over or is it just beginning fasten your seatbelts it's going to be a bumpy night you ever see a female private Shantay to you - I distinctly remember a distant crossing you off my guest list what are you doing here do you would an unforgettable Peter Pan you must pray together you remember miss Casswell I do not how do you do we've never met maybe that's what Miss Casswell is an actress a graduate of the Copacabana school of Dramatic Art good evening mr. DeWitt I know I do you two knew each other this must be at long last formal introduction until now we've only met in passing that's how you make me one row is the dumb blonde so she was making a pass at her and that's how you met me and passed in passing the line of course fasten your seat belts is going to be a bumpy night is one of the most famous lines in all of film a brilliant brilliant piece of writing but note just note for a minute the assumed cultural references that it was assumed that you would get the references to Macbeth the references to the Copacabana he's from the Copacabana school acting in other words she's a club girl she's a dancer at this crappy Copacabana Club you know so and and he's making fun of this because Betty Davis was playing this great stage actress you were wonderful in Peter Pan you know I mean that's just saying you're old basically but the assumption that you could understand this that you were not it was not above you that you could aspire to this as opposed to the other way around that you would aspire down to be like Eminem and just talked the language of the streets to talk the language of rap you know and this has began with the Beatles and you hear sometimes you hear Ben Shapiro go off and the Beatles never buddy gets very upset and because the Beatles were very talented and that's what they get upset about but the Beatles changed the order so in other words in the old days Frank Sinatra would come on and he would sing a classic Cole Porter song like I get no kick from champagne and it was he was elevating you into this cultural world of champagne I get no cake from champagne some they may go for cocaine you know this was a a very elegant world that he says when I'm out on a quiet street fighting vainly the old ennui and you you're supposed to live up into that cultural world with the Beatles they brought you down the language was now she loves you yeah yeah yeah it's been a hard day's night and I've been working like a dog but when I get home to you you know I work all day to get money to buy you things it was very very basic working class but they English called the kitchen sink School of the Arts now listen that's democratization that is democracy playing out it's logic that the world is for everybody that we have to respect everybody but but it means that language loses its importance and its ability to transmit truth because what is happening in All About Eve is people are lis using language to communicate in a way that is subtle that's intricate that assumes a sort of cultural reference point that we all have now how many people know what's in Macbeth could you make a movie where you reference Macbeth than anybody knew what you were talking about I don't think you actually could make a popular movie that did that and when we have lost those cultural reference points we lose the ability to say things in a very rapid way when we mentioned Macbeth a whole world of meaning opens up that is now cut you're now cut off from that and if you go to school and you study English literature you may not read Macbeth so that that whole world of meaning that has been with us for thousands of years is being taken away from you as being you're being deprived of it so the democratization of language and of thought actually comes at a tremendous tremendous price that I'm not not actually convinced is worth paying and I think that that'll that will it will change it will turn back around but I think right now you're being actually cut off from your heritage of meaning all right it's the end the clayvin last weekend is here that means that you've got to go on and listen to another Kingdom tomorrow there's the penultimate episode the second-to-last episode comes out tomorrow episode 12 there

five-star ratings so I think that you really will enjoy it we will end this my son said here's my son was on a plane and he listened to you know how they have all that lousy music on a plane and they let he listened to the my son Spencer he was listening to the new talent from the UK and he stumbled on a genuine discovery a woman named Rose Betts who has a piece out now called the stars look down and it's a perfect example of some of what we're talking about because the the as she puts it out she herself made this kind of video it's nostalgic for this life this higher life of high culture but what's interesting about this is the stars look down as a phrase a title of a famous novel that was excoriating Society for its treatment of coal miners so it's it actually has a kind of irony built in whether Rose Betts knew this or not I don't know she is in the Adele school you'll hear her she sounds a lot like Adele but she really is talented and the song itself is very beautiful I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show listen to another kingdom please on iTunes and I will see you here on Monday if you survive the Clavin last weekend I've done some my floors are clicking heels
