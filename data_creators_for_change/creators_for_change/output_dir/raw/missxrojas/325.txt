00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,520
it was a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good day i woke up at</font>

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,230
five fifteen a.m. and headed on the

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,240
train down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Brighton there in Brighton</font>

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,460
I was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the 14 speakers at the TEDx</font>

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,900
Brighton event the event was

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,519
specifically about their generation gap

9
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,500
and if you want proof but I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it</font>

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see this is me this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is me</font>

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,000
sitting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sofa from friends I think</font>

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,199
my talk went well and I certainly

13
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">enjoyed listening to the other speakers</font>

14
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">who spoke with such a wide range of</font>

15
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">topics from sharing economies to the</font>

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,070
7-up series of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Granada to the amazing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">arrested became an amnesty international</font>

20
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,780
prisoner of conscience and emerged with

21
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,430
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely different perspective on</font>

22
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,140
everything and actually works with

23
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,030
democratic organizations within the

24
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,100
Middle East the motto for Ted is ideas

25
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,390
worth sharing and if you go on the

26
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,460
website you'll find incredible videos of

27
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,140
people talking conveniently seeing as

28
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Friday's Rosie answers a lot of you did</font>

29
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,199
have questions about the nature of the

30
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">event and when you could see stuff</font>

31
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,110
online from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the event so I thought I</font>

32
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,699
would answer this now I'm just using

33
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:57,989
them generally are not going to mention

34
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,340
any user names because a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

35
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,930
were repeated a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people ask when</font>

36
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,039
they could see it when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

37
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,270
online I think they're going online

38
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,979
within the next few weeks in the

39
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,390
meantime I do encourage you to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

40
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,710
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Ted website and watch them their</font>

41
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos because there have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

42
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,979
incredible once I think you can find

43
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,450
some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on YouTube as well there's</font>

44
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,340
that congressional a lot was what was I

45
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,049
talking about and I was actually talking

46
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,460
about you guys and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

47
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing that we do with the internet</font>

48
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and with YouTube broadly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking I was</font>

49
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,500
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how the internet and</font>

50
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,540
online video in particular can create

51
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,700
really critical and responsive and

52
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,070
intelligent and creative readers and how

53
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,360
it's a really great environment for

54
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,369
conversation rather than the basics of

55
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,170
very restrictive reading comprehension

56
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,380
and age banded experience of books but

57
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,030
also have a support system of an online

58
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">community then becomes such a big</font>

59
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,540
presence in your life that they're there

60
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,040
for you when other big things have been

61
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for example the death of your</font>

62
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,070
father another big question was how I

63
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,360
came to speak at the event and that

64
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened when Natalie Lloyd who produced</font>

65
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,420
the event into such a terrific job

66
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,430
producing event it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is unbelievable how</font>

67
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,049
calm she seen the whole day she emailed

68
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">me in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> summertime asking me whether</font>

69
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,899
I'd like to be involved because she'd

70
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,729
seen my youtube videos and of course the

71
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,469
chance to speak at such a you know big

72
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,680
event with such incredible associations

73
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
oh I'm just crazy to meet having<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

74
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,179
graduated<font color="#CCCCCC"> from university and feeling</font>

75
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,889
very lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what I was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

76
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,360
to be asked to speak at such an event

77
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">fell I found</font>

78
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,140
honored<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be asked how many times have</font>

79
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,760
I said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be asked in the past 30</font>

80
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,890
seconds honestly so anyway so it's

81
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

82
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,620
since then i wrote a big chunk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

83
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,480
when i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> out chicago celebrating my</font>

86
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">very specific memory of one morning just</font>

87
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,350
kind of slightly panicking and tried to

88
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,270
write it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating cold pasta from</font>

89
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,310
the night before and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room with</font>

well as in part about book shops and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

93
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,730
structuring reading experience but I was

94
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sitting around there looking around</font>

95
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
with me like he's all the people the

96
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,830
physical people I've met from this time

97
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">little square and I know it's something</font>

98
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can think about a lot but it</font>

99
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,660
still never stops being amazing to me

100
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,120
and absolutely never stops and then

101
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,190
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lex attended the event she bought</font>

102
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,750
a ticket she was in the audience and

103
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,520
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">when my best friend supporting me but</font>

105
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
also someone who really understands that

106
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,890
on my community thing the last question

107
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,720
was whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I was nervous about</font>

108
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,730
talking at TEDx my experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

109
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,050
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much like any other public</font>

110
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,610
speaking event that I've done I've done

111
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,960
quite a lot of public speaking it did

112
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,150
some in secondary school I've spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

113
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,100
big groups of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and for Fulbright</font>

114
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,630
who are considering doing short-term

115
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,760
study abroad I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot presentations</font>

116
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,020
sometimes two three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

117
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,450
sometimes to 40 or 50 people it's a

118
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,710
place I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite comfortable and</font>

119
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,030
strangely confident<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him and I</font>

120
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,560
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a really good a nice</font>

121
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,330
amount of adrenaline format to the run

122
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,430
up to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the speaking itself I don't</font>

123
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,530
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel nervous what happens</font>

124
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,600
afterwards however that is the thing

125
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I do not so much enjoy about it I</font>

126
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">just get flooded especially when it's</font>

127
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,110
something that's quite personal your

128
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">ideas sharing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying this is an</font>

129
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,620
important idea you're putting it forward

130
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,990
and that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for people to</font>

131
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,820
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's at that point that</font>

132
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,620
I get nervous oolitic am I talking

133
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,290
complete crap am I saying nothing of

134
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,960
worth and how did I talk did I mumble

135
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">over everything did I talk too quickly</font>

136
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,500
did I talk too slowly was it obvious

137
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,690
that in this part I forgot exactly what

138
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,330
I was going to say it sometimes happens

139
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,590
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes afterwards it sometimes</font>

140
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,300
happens a few hours afterwards for me it

141
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,459
happened four or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five hours afterwards</font>

142
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:14,930
when I was all my train back here and

143
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,358
makes you really doubt your ability to

144
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,548
do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> or think carefully and</font>

145
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">critically will just offer anything to</font>

146
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,820
the world to have any sort of thought

147
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,800
purpose

148
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,090
suppose i'm going to edit this to go

149
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,050
straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sleep because i have work</font>
