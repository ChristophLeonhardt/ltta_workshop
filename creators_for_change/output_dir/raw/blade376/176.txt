00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,840
that I grind my teeth so I got a mouth

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,269
conversation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and it was only</font>

15
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,279
into a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes in that he realized I</font>

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,140
wasn't having a conversation and I was

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,120

22
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,550
