Four million!
We can't believe it.
Really cool, four million. Started from the
bottom now we here.
Woooooo
Is thank you one word or
two?
It's one word.
So we have a treat for you,
our loyal subscribers.
So we're making a
video about all the questions you had
about the team.
Anything that you wanted
so let's get right to it.
so a lot of you want to know where a lot
of the producers have been.
Since the beginning of this year we've been at
work on the biggest project we've ever
undertaken.
We've been working on a
new show for Netflix!
It's called
"Explained" and it's gonna start on May 23rd.
That's all you get for now.
May 23rd, see you there.
Peter from the US wants to know will you
answer this question?
Will you answer
this question?
Will you answer this -- YES!
So Brian from
Argentina wants to know: how you choose
your stories?
Based on personal
experience, so if there's something that
really annoys me or frustrates me.
Stories that can only be explained on a
map.
What can we show, what can we point a
camera at, what can we animate, what makes
a good video is what makes something visual.
Tell the story to a friend, if
then it still feels interesting then I
know it's interesting.
Do your friends
like dread you coming to dinner, they're like
here comes Christophe...
Christopher from the United
States wants to know: what's the oddest
thing you've you've ever done for a
video?
I feel like you do an odd thing in every video.
I interviewed a professional
regurgitator.
Climbed into a bear cave.
Throwing glitter at you,
throwing a football at you,
throwing balloons at you.
You throw a lot of stuff at me. I know.
I don't know the oddest
thing, but I think the most extraordinary
thing was visiting a migrant camp for
Borders.
Look up the sizes of all of the ape and human
testicles that exist.
Alec from the
United States asks: what led you to working
at Vox as opposed to any other site?
To me Vox is pretty even-keeled and
balanced and considers both sides of the
argument.
Johnny Harris hired me.
I think Vox is doing the coolest video
on the internet right now.
When Vox was
first announced, they had this concept:
the thing that's new isn't necessarily
the thing that's important.
I was really drawn to that.
Robert from Poland
wants to know if you know what Vox means?
It literally means voice.
Vox is Latin for
George Soros.
It actually means "free
La Croix in the break room."
I think that
it means that Vox media was kind of
built around the idea of highlighting
lots and lots of people's voices.
Alec Bowman from the United States asked if
we're owned by a bigger company.
Yeah, Vox.com is a part of Vox media. It's a
bunch of sister sites like The Verge, SB
Nation, Eater, Racked, Curbed.
Polygon.
Oh yeah, Polygon. Polygon's dope.
There are a lot of video makers at Vox Media
Vox.com is just one channel so go
check them out.
Colin wants to know if
you'll go on a date with him?
No.
Not again.
Not after what happened last time.
Madeline wants to know what your favorite emoji
is Dean.
The shrimp one.
How do you use that?
With the tophat emoji a lot.
I'm almost more curious which ones you
wouldn't use it with because I can't think of one.
Jamin from India wants to know where all
of us are from.
So let's pull up a map.
We're starting
in New York.
New Jersey, Philadelphia,
Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois,
Minnesota, Seattle, Oregon.
Isn't that the same thing?
Seattle and Oregon?
California, Arizona,
Texas, Alabama, Florida, Virginia, Maryland,
Madrid, Vancouver, and Korea and Delhi, India.
A lot of you have asked what are
some of the challenges of making Borders.
Just the fact that you come up with this
story and this idea and then when you
show up, the lines are always so much
more blurrier than the neat structure
that you had in mind before you went.
I think this is a good thing from a
reporting perspective, to have much more
rigor and kind of local information, so
while they're challenging they make
Borders much better.
Why don't you all tell us like what you use
for animation?
After effects. After Effects. My imagination.
That's what you use for animation?
Yes.
Are people above 30 allowed to work
at Vox?
Yeah definitely, I mean you've got
a whole range of people. You've got people who
are 23 like me and then you've got
people who are a lot of older, too, so.
Pretty much anybody.
Jacob from the United States wants to know: should I get a job in media?
Students: the advice I
would give is like a lot of the skills
that you need to work in media
are actually skills that you can build up
without working in media.
You should get
a job in media if you are passionate
about the news and you're passionate
about sharing information with people.
Do you have any music recommendations?
That's a good one.
No. I don't listen to music.
A bunch of people asked how we make
money.
It's pretty simple, on YouTube we
make money by selling ads.
There are
actually ads besides pre-roll that we
should tell you about.
So first one is
editorial sponsorships, like in Earworm
you saw a "Presented by Toyota Camry" bug at
the top corner of the video.
That means
that they paid to be in the video and
they have no editorial say.
We didn't owe anything to Toyota Camry
except the final version of the video.
We all got a Camry.
Yeah I drive a Camry now.
Thank you Toyota.
Really good sound quality in the
speakers.
Who would be both of your dream
sponsors?
Panera, probably.
We've been angling for a Panera
sponsorship for my videos for a while.
I don't want them to sponsor me because  it's
a conflict of interest.
Because I just
got there too often.
The other way we
make money is through branded content
and we actually have a whole separate
team who works on branded content.
Our team, all the people you see in this
video don't make those videos, but there
are other people in our company who do.
They're called the explainer studio and
they've taken a lot of the cool things
that we've invented through our
experimentations Vox video and apply it
to brands.
If there is a piece of branded
content on our channel, it will always
say "advertiser content" in the title.
That is worth paying for our videos right now.
So thank you for supporting us and I
hope we do get to make you more videos.
Three, two one.
Thank you all so much for watching Vox.
It's so awesome that
there's four million of you.
Five million, see you at five million.
Alright, bye.
Thanks for watching Vox.
Thanks for watching us at Vox.
Thanks for watching this video
that's eight minutes long.
