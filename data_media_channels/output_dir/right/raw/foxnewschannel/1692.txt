1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,747
â™ª

2
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:15,149
>> MAKE NO MISTAKE.

3
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,884
HAMAS IS PLEASED WITH THE

4
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,120
RESULTS FROM YESTERDAY.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,623
I ASK MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN

6
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:23,491
THE SECURITY COUNCIL WHO

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,559
AMONG US WOULD ACCEPT THIS

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,595
TYPE OF ACTIVITY ON YOUR

9
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:27,929
BORDER?

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:29,464
NO ONE WOULD.

11
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,266
NO COUNTRY IN THIS CHAMBER

12
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,101
WOULD ACT WITH MORE

13
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,636
RESTRAINT THAN ISRAEL HAS.

14
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,871
IN FACT, THE RECORDS OF

15
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,707
SEVERAL COUNTRIES HERE TODAY

16
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,377
SUGGEST THEY WOULD BE MUCH

17
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:43,878
LESS RESTRAINED.

18
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,480
THOSE WHO SUGGEST THAT THE

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,814
GAZA VIOLENCE HAS ANYTHING

20
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,483
TO DO WITH THE LOCATION OF

21
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:51,653
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY ARE

22
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:53,054
SORELY MISTAKEN.

23
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,222
RATHER THE VIOLENCE COMES

24
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,791
FROM THOSE WHO REJECT THE

25
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,692
EXISTENCE OF THE STATE OF

26
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:59,927
ISRAEL IN ANY LOCATION.

27
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:00,561
STEVE: THERE HAVE YOU GOT

28
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,696
THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR

29
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,498
TO THE UNITED NATIONS NIKKI

30
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:04,732
HALEY YESTERDAY AT AN

31
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,402
EMERGENCY SESSION OF THE

32
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,403
SECURITY COUNCIL CALLED FOR

33
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:11,939
BY THE COUNTRY OF KUWAIT

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,807
AFTER 60 PALESTINIANS WERE

35
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,842
KILLED A DAY BEFORE IN THIS

36
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,911
STAND OFF BETWEEN GAZA AND

37
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:17,245
ISRAEL.

38
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:17,945
ALAN DERSHOWITZ WAS ACTUALLY

39
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,047
IN GAZA LAST WEEK.

40
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,015
HE ALSO MET WITH BENJAMIN

41
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,116
NETANYAHU THE LAST COUPLE OF

42
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:22,483
DAYS.

43
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,152
AND HE JOINS US LIVE FROM

44
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:26,254
TEL AVIV.

45
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:26,888
PROFESSOR, THANK YOU VERY

46
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:27,622
MUCH FOR JOINING US.

47
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,190
YOU KNOW, ISRAEL HAS BEEN

48
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,292
PAINTED BY THE MEDIA AS HAVE

49
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,896
BEEN THE AGGRESSOR IN THIS.

50
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,231
>> WELL, THAT'S THE HAMAS

51
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:37,699
TACTIC.

52
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,068
IT'S CALLED THE DEAD BABY

53
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:40,501
STRATEGY.

54
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,804
YOU USE CHILDREN AND WOMEN.

55
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:43,905
YOU DELIBERATELY PUT THEM ON

56
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:44,906
THE FRONT LINES.

57
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,174
YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

58
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,842
ISRAEL TO DEFEND ITSELF

59
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:52,347
WITHOUT OCCASIONALLY KILLING

60
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,215
A WOMAN OR CHILD OR ELDERLY

61
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:54,749
PERSON.

62
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:56,951
EVERY TIME ISRAEL ACCIDENTLY

63
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,087
KILLS SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

64
00:01:59,087 --> 00:01:59,754
ISRAELIS GRIEVE.

65
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:00,988
ISRAEL LOSES.

66
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,123
HAMAS CHEERS AND CELEBRATES

67
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:02,957
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

68
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:03,658
THEY WANT.

69
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,126
THEY WANT THE MEDIA TO SHOW

70
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:05,860
THE BODY COUNT.

71
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,829
THEY WANT THE MEDIA TO SHOW

72
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,964
THE DEAD BABY EVEN THOUGH

73
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,299
ISRAEL TRIED EVERYTHING IN

74
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,369
ITS POWER TO AVOID CIVILIAN

75
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:15,336
CASUALTIES.

76
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,204
AMBASSADOR HALEY WAS

77
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,638
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WHEN SHE

78
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:22,009
SAID THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE

79
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,478
DEATHS IS ATTRIBUTEDDABLE TO

80
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,079
HAMAS AND EVERY COUNTRY IN

81
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,414
THE WESTERN WORLD WOULD HAVE

82
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,249
DONE EXACTLY THE SAME.

83
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,751
I WAS DOWN THERE IN GAZA.

84
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,986
I MET WITH PEOPLE AND I MET

85
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,221
WITH THE SOLDIERS.

86
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:35,123
THEY ARE TERRIFIED ABOUT

87
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,291
40,000 PEOPLE WITH ARMS AND

88
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,593
WITH MOLOTOV COCKTAILS

89
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,528
BREAKING DOWN THE FENCE.

90
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,830
MURDERING ISRAELI CHILDREN.

91
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,599
TAKING HOSTAGES AND TAKING

92
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,567
PEOPLE WHO THEY CAN THEN

93
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,502
EXCHANGE FOR PRISONERS.

94
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,537
ISRAEL DID EXACTLY WHAT

95
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:50,905
AMERICA IS DOING AND THE

96
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,573
WORLD OUGHT TO CONDEMN A,

97
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:55,376
HAMAS AND ALSO THE MEDIA

98
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,078
THAT INCENTIVIZES AND

99
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,112
ENCOURAGES HAMAS TO DO THIS

100
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,847
BY REPORTING IN SUCH A

101
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,183
BIASED MANNER.

102
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:02,850
ABBY: UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE

103
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,918
THAT ALL TOO OFTEN TODAY

104
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,620
WITH THE MEDIA'S REPORTING

105
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,654
SHOWS A MUCH DIFFERENT

106
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,755
REALITY FROM WHAT'S GOING ON

107
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:08,389
ON THE GROUND.

108
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,791
YOU MET ABOUT B. NETANYAHU

109
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,491
AS STEVE SAID.

110
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:11,893
WHAT DID YOU TWO TALK ABOUT

111
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:12,260
YESTERDAY.

112
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,262
WHAT DID HE SAY?

113
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,230
>> WELL, HE IS DESPERATELY

114
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,633
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO

115
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,102
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

116
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,670
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT

117
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,972
EVERY TIME ISRAEL

118
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:25,840
INADVERTENTLY KILLS AN

119
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,142
INNOCENT PERSON, IT LOSES.

120
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,577
IT LOSES THE MORAL HIGH

121
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:29,911
GROUND.

122
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,345
IT LOSES AMONG ITS OWN

123
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:31,879
PEOPLE.

124
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,281
AND, YET, THE MEDIA

125
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,116
ENCOURAGES THIS AND HE IS

126
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:37,251
TRYING TO DEVELOP NONLETHAL

127
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,186
WAYS OF DOING THIS.

128
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:39,854
AND THERE ARE MANY IN THE

129
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:40,888
WORKS BUT THEY WILL TAKE

130
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,589
SOME TIME.

131
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,124
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT, YOU

132
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:44,692
KNOW, THE IRAN DEAL, WE

133
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,593
TALKED ABOUT THE MOVING OF

134
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,295
THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.

135
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,029
I WAS THERE.

136
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,931
IT WAS A GREAT EVENT.

137
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,798
THE EMBASSY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

138
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,835
MOVED TO JERUSALEM 70 YEARS

139
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:54,368
AGO.

140
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,470
EVERY COUNTRY BUT ISRAEL HAD

141
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,939
THE RIGHT TO NAME ITS OWN

142
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,372
CAPITAL.

143
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,341
BUT FOR YEARS AMERICA WOULD

144
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,742
NOT ALLOW ISRAEL TO NAME ITS

145
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,710
OWN CAPITAL.

146
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,511
FINALLY THEY HAVE DONE THAT

147
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,914
AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

148
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:07,682
BRIAN: ALAN, THERE IS A LOT

149
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:09,150
OF PEOPLE HERE, PRETTY

150
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,219
STUNNED THAT THEY'RE

151
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:11,819
CRITICIZING IVANKA FOR

152
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,020
SMILING DURING THE OPENING

153
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,322
OF THE EMBASSY WHILE THERE

154
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,590
ARE RIOTS ON THE GAZA

155
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:15,923
BORDER.

156
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,892
I FIND THAT UNTHINKABLE AND

157
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,427
TOTALLY DISTASTEFUL THAT

158
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,695
THEY WOULD SAY YOU CAN'T

159
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:21,495
SMILE AT THIS HISTORIC EVENT

160
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:26,100
WHEN YOU ARE REPRESENTING

161
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,368
AMERICA?

162
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:28,736
I SMILED, JOE LIEBERMAN WHO

163
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,304
WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME

164
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:30,638
SMILED.

165
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:31,806
PEOPLE BOTH FROM ALL SIDES

166
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,274
OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM

167
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:33,608
SMILED.

168
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,709
IT WAS A GREAT EVENT.

169
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,978
IT WAS AN HISTORIC EVENT.

170
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,381
FINALLY AMERICA RECOGNIZES

171
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,883
THAT JERUSALEM HAS BEEN AND

172
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:44,452
ALWAYS WILL BE ISRAEL'S

173
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:44,785
CAPITAL.

174
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,853
IT WAS A WONDERFUL EVENT.

175
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:46,888
OBVIOUSLY MANY OF US WERE

176
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:48,389
THINKING ABOUT THE TRAGEDIES

177
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,857
OCCURRING IN GAZA AND IN

178
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:50,157
SYRIA.

179
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,393
I WAS ALSO UP AT THE SYRIA

180
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:52,727
BURDEN.

181
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:53,961
I WAS AT THE BARB WIRE.

182
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,396
I COULD HEAR THE BOMBS GOING

183
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,131
OFF JUST MILES AWAY.

184
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,733
I WAS JUST 100 YARDS AWAY

185
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,635
FROM THE IRON DOME WHICH

186
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,370
STOPPED ROCKETS FROM IRAN

187
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,839
COMING AND KILLING ISRAELI

188
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,474
CIVILIANS ON THE GOLAN.

189
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,175
ISRAEL FACES ENEMIES ALL

190
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:08,476
OVER.

191
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,577
IT WAS ABOUT TIME THERE WAS

192
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,079
A CELEBRATION IN JERUSALEM

193
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,115
IN WEST JERUSALEM WHICH IS

194
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:15,449
THE JEWISH NEIGHBORHOOD OF

195
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,217
JERUSALEM FINALLY MOVING THE

196
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:16,717
EMBASSY THERE.

197
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,185
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION BY

198
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:18,686
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

199
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,655
IT WAS THE RIGHT EVENT.

200
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,491
THE EVENT WAS WONDERFUL.

201
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,027
I'M GLAD IVANKA SMILED.

202
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,929
I'M GLAD JARED KUSHNER GAVE

203
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:28,729
A WONDERFUL SPEECH TALKING

204
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:29,564
ABOUT HOW THIS DOESN'T

205
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:30,831
REDUCE THE PROSPECTS FOR

206
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,132
PEACE.

207
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,967
IT ONLY MAKES THE PROSPECTS

208
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:33,935
OF PEACE GREATER BECAUSE

209
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,636
THERE IS NOW AN INCENTIVE ON

210
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:36,971
BOTH SIDES TO COME TO THE

211
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:37,471
BARGAINING TABLE.

212
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,006
THE PALESTINIANS CAN HAVE

213
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,441
THEIR OWN CAPITAL IN EAST

214
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:40,808
JERUSALEM.

215
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:41,709
THEY CAN'T GET A STATE

216
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,977
UNLESS THEY COME TO THE

217
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:43,477
BARGAINING TABLE.

218
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,846
AND I HOPE THEY WILL FINALLY

219
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:46,547
NOT MISS ANOTHER

220
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,815
OPPORTUNITIES TO MISS AN

221
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,383
OPPORTUNITY AS THEY DID IN

222
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,787
1938 AND 1948 AND 2000, 2001

223
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:53,354
AND 2008.

224
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,822
THEY NEVER COME TO THE

225
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,423
BARGAINING TABLE.

226
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,024
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET A

227
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,593
STATE THROUGH VIOLENCE.

228
00:05:58,593 --> 00:05:59,627
THROUGH SECURITY COUNCIL

229
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:00,027
RESOLUTIONS.

230
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:00,995
THROUGH B.B.S.

231
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,430
THEY WILL GET A STATE BY

232
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,197
COMING IN AND NEGOTIATING

233
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,032
AND I HOPE THEY DUAL THAT.

234
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,233
BRIAN: NOT WITH HAMAS.

235
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,234
STEVE: NOBODY KNOWS THE

236
00:06:07,234 --> 00:00:00,000
TOPIC BETTER THAN ALAN
