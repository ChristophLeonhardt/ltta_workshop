I think stop-and-frisk in New York City it was so incredible the way it worked now we had a very good mayor but New York City was incredible the way that works so I think that would be one step you could do Donald Trump talks about stopper first like he knows the facts he has had no experience with policing no experience with Public Safety he should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop and frisk all over this country you would see a lot more tension between police and community
