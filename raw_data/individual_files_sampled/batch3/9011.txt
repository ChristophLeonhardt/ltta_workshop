Neil: YOU KNOW, MIGHT NOT BE ONE AND DONE IN SINGAPORE, THAT THE SO-CALLED ONE-DAY MEETING MIGHT EXTEND THERE DOWN THE ROAD AND THAT THE TALK THAT THEY'RE PROMISING COULD YIELD SORT OF A DURATION OF THE LIKES OF RONALD REAGAN AND MIKAEL GORBACHEV. THAT WAS THEN, WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW? THE READ FROM KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL. WHAT HE MAKES OF THIS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PROSPECT, SENATOR, THAT THIS COULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD STRETCH OUT A LITTLE BIT? YOU KNOW, I'M STILL VERY HOPEFUL. I'M BACK GLAD WE'RE BACK ON AGAIN WITH THE KOREAN SUMMIT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASY SOLUTION BUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION AND BEGINNINGS OF DIPLOMACY IS A GOOD THING. Neil: SO IT'S TRADE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE CHINESE AND NOW WITH THE ALLIES, THE CANADIANS ARE UPSET, FRENCH, GERMANS. EVERYBODY SEEMS UNSET. DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE TIME TO BE RUFFLING THEIR FEATHERS WHILE WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING FAR BIGGER FOR THE TIME BEING? NO. I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO USE NATIONAL SECURITY WAIVERS TO INVOKE ON OUR FRIENDS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE MISINTERPRET, THEY TALK ABOUT THE TRADE DEFICIT AS MONEY THAT WE'VE LOST. EVERYBODY HAS A DEFICIT WITH PEOPLE THAT THEY BUY STUFF FROM. I HAVE A DEFICIT WITH MY GROCERY STORE. TEXAS MAY HAVE A DEFICIT WITH OKLAHOMA. BUT IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL MEASUREMENT. DOESN'T MEASURE PROSPERITY. YOU WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE COUNTRY HAS MORE TRADE OR LESS AND IF YOUR ECONOMY IS GROWING AND IN MORE PEOPLE HAVE JOBS. Neil: SO YOUR COLLEAGUE, SENATOR CORKER IS AMONG THOSE AND OTHERS, MAYBE YOU ARE, TOO, THAT THINKS THAT THIS SHOULD GET A SENATE YEA OR NAY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING. I'M ALWAYS A BELIEVER IN CONGRESS RECOUPING ITS POWER, TAKING ITS POWER BACK. WE HAVE ABDICATED SO MUCH POWER AND GIVEN IT UP TO THE PRESIDENCY, WHETHER IT'S WAR-MAKING OR HEALTHCARE ECONOMY, REGULATIONS IN ANY INDUSTRY. WE HAVE GIVEN UP TOO MUCH POWER TO THE PRESIDENT. I'M ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF TRYING TO GET THAT POWER BACK. Neil: DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT IS STARTING A BAD PRECEDENT HERE? HE HAS BROUGHT SOME PEOPLE IRANIAN ACCESS TENSION THAT THE CHINESE AND MANY FRIENDS HAVE RIGGED THE SYSTEM TO THEIR BENEFIT? IS THIS THE PROPER RESPONSE? IS HE GOING TOO FAR? YOU LOOK AT THE OLD TRADE DEALS FROM DECADES AGO AND THEY HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY WAIVER IN THEM. THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE OKAY. TOMORROW WE DECLARED WAR, 1941 WITH JAPAN. SHOULD WE NOW REASSESS OUR TRADE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. IT WASN'T ABOUT USING IT AS AN EXCUSE TO PUT TARIFFS ON ANYBODY. IT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE THREAT OF WAR OR THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES OF WAR, TO NOT TRADE WITH AN ENEMY. SO IT'S A MISAPPROPRIATION AND A MISUSE OF LANGUAGE FROM A LONG TIME AGO AND I DON'T THINK IT'S HELPFUL. I HAVE FARMERS IN MY STATE. EVERY FARMER IS AGAINST A TRADE WAR. I HAVE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. 20,000 PEOPLE WORK FOR TOYOTA. WE EXPORT BOURBON IN OUR IN KENTUCKY AS WELL. AGAINST A TRADE WAR. SO KENTUCKY BENEFITS FROM TRADE. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE LESS TRADE. WE WANT MORE TRADE. Neil: AHEAD OF THE NORTH KOREAN MEETING, SENATOR, THERE'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD GRANT OR OFFER TO THE NORTH KOREANS TO GET THEM TO DENUCLEARIZE. ONE OF THE IDEAS, IN ADDRESSING THE NUMBER OF TROOPS OF 50,000 IN KOREA. YOU'VE BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN OPPONENT OF OUR COMMITMENT AROUND THE WORLD. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO, THERE WAS AN OP-ED THAT I WROTE THAT PERHAPS THE FORCES OF THE DMZ COULD BECOME MORE INTERNATIONAL AND CHINA COULD BE PART OF THAT. THERE'S A DISTRUST ON NORTH KOREAN'S PART AFTER LIBYA, THE IRAN AGREEMENT A LOT OF DISTRUST. IF YOU CAN GET AN INTERNATIONAL FORCE THERE IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM GIVING UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM, IT WOULD BE WORTH WHILE. I WOULDN'T JUST GIVE IT AWAY. WE WOULD BE WILLING TO WITHDRAW TROOPS IF THERE'S A DENUCLEARIZATION AND AN ENTER NATIONAL FORCE THAT WOULD REPLACE OUR FORCES. Neil: WHAT DID YOU MEAN OF USE OF FORCE WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS OR ONGOING MILITARY ACTIONS WITHOUT ANY CHECKING? YOU'RE TALKING ACTED OUR HEARING TODAY? Neil: YES. WE HAD A HEARING TODAY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN AT WAR WITH AFGHANISTAN. WHILE I WAS IN FAVOR OF THE ORIGINAL USE OF FORCE, I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF AN UNLIMITED THREE SITUATION TO BE AT WAR FOREVER. WE'RE AT WAR OF EIGHT DIFFERENT GROUP AND 20 COUNTRIES. WE HAD SOLDIERS DIE IN MALI THE OTHER DAY. MANY PEOPLE CAN'T FIND MALI ON THE MAP AND HAVE NO IDEA WHY WE'RE THERE. WE SHOULD BE DEBATING. IT'S CONGRESS'S ROLE. IT'S CONGRESS' ROLE OF DEBATING THAT. Neil: SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IF SOMETHING WERE TO ACT UP, THE SYRIANS USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS, WHAT WOULD BE SENATOR RAND PAUL'S POSITION WOULD BE? THE WAR POWER'S ACT AND PEOPLE OVER TIME HAVE COME TO BELIEVE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN REPEL IMMINENT INVASION. IF WE BELIEVE SOMEONE IS IN THE PROCESS OF LAUNCHES A WEAPON AGAINST US, YES, THE PRESIDENT CAN ACT IMMINENTLY. WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED ON PEARL HARBOR, IT TOOK 24 HOURS AND CONGRESS ACTED UNANIMOUSLY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW UP CHEMICAL MUNITIONS, YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR CONGRESS. YOU'LL FIND A DEBATE ABOUT IT AND WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE DECIDED THAT THAT WAS THE BEST APPROPRIATE ACTION. Neil: AS WEIGHTY AS IMPORTANT THOSE REMARKS ARE AND THAT LINE OF THINKING IS, I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE IT WAS YOUR TWEET ON BILL CLINTON AND COMMENTS ABOUT MONICA LEWINSKY THAT GOT FAR MORE PLAY. THAT'S THE WAY. HE EPITOMIZES THE AGGRESSOR, NOT THE VICTIM. YOU CAN'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATE OR CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AN INTERN. DID YOU EXPECT IT WOULD GET AS MUCH BUZZ AND PLAY? I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT I DON'T THINK HE'S TRULY CONTRITE. VICTIM. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYBODY WOULD HAVE THE AUDACITY, BILL CLINTON, TO ASK HIM ABOUT THIS. TWO DECADES THE MAIN STREET MEDIA COVERED UP FOR HIM. HE SAID IT WAS CONSENSUAL AFFAIR BETWEEN ADULTS. TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT THIS. MOST WOMEN FROM THE ME TOO MOVEMENT SAYS A 20-YEAR-OLD IS NOT REALLY CAPABLE OF GIVING CONSENT IN THE WORKPLACE TO HAVE SEX UNDER THE DESK. IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT, THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE IN 1998 IF YOU WERE THE CEO OF ANY MAJOR COMPANY. NOBODY WOULD THOUGHT THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR AND HE STILL DOESN'T GET IT. HE SAYS OH, I WAS I WAS IN DEBT AND BEFORE I MADE MY NEXT $100 MILLION, I WAS IN A FEW MONTHS IN DEBT. SO YOU KNOW Neil: I WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE PRESIDENT CLINTON ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS NOTION WHETHER A PRESIDENT CAN PARDON HIMSELF. HE SAID NO. DO YOU THINK THAT THIS PRESIDENT, TALKING ABOUT THAT VERY SUBJECT, CAN? HE THINKS HE CAN. THE CONSTITUTION SEEMS TO PUT NO LIMITS ON THE PRESIDENT. THERE'S SOME PRINCIPLES OF LAW WHERE PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT IT DEFIES SORT OF THE IDEAS OF JUSTICE FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO PARDON THEMSELVES. BUT THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T EXPLICIT IN PROHIBITING THIS. SO YES, HE CAN PROBABLY DO IT. BUT YOU NOTICE THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS, HE SAYS HE'S GUILTY OF NOTHING AND HE'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT. BUT I THINK THAT Neil: WHY MENTION IT, SENATOR? I THINK BECAUSE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THIS WHOLE INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA HAS BECOME SO POLITICIZED, YOU WONDER. SO THEY HAVE INFORMANTS IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. DID THEY PUT INFORMANT IN PRESIDENT CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. SHE WAS TRYING TO DIG UP STUFF ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO SOUNDS LIKE, YOU KNOW, DO WHY WANT THE FBI AND THE CIA, DO WE WANT THEM INVOLVED IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS? SHOULD THERE BE SORT OF A HANDS OFF ON THIS? I THINK IT'S UNSEEMLY THAT THE FBI WAS PUTTING INFORMANTS IN THERE, TRYING TO EXTRACT AND ENTRAP MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. IT'S INCREDIBLY INAPPROPRIATE. Neil: THE PRESIDENT CALLED IT SPYGATE. HE WORKED FOR THE FBI FOR SEVERAL DECADES. HE'S PAYING PEOPLE MONEY TO GET THEM TO LONDON. THERE'S SOME THAT SAY THERE'S A WHOLE RUNNING INTO THE AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR OR DEPUTY AMBASSADOR OVER DRINKS WITH ONE OF THE TRUMP OFFICIALS WAS NOT SORT OF A RANDOM EVENT, THAT MAYBE THAT HAD BEEN PLANNED. SO YES, THAT'S ENTRAPMENT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH. THERE'S STILL EVIDENCE AND JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT THE BRITISH WERE GIVING INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO JOHN BRENNAN. I ASKED GINA HASPEL ABOUT THIS. SHE SAYS THAT SHE CATEGORICALLY DENIES THAT SHE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE BRITISH GIVING INFORMATION TO JOHN BRENNAN. SO THE NEXT SHOULD BE TO JOHN BRENNAN. ARE YOU GIVING INFORMATION TO THEM? THAT'S ILLEGAL. NOW HE'S THIS BIG TALKING HEAD SPEWING HATRED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. SOUNDS LIKE HE'S COME OUT OF THE CLOSET AS A PARTISAN. MAYBE HE NEEDS TO BE ASKED UNDER OATH, DID YOU RECEIVE INFORMATION, SECRET INFORMATION, ILLEGAL GOTTEN BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, DID YOU RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION ON PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HIS CAMPAIGN? ASK BRENNAN THAT UNDER OATH AND SEE WHAT HE SAYS. Neil: BACK TO BILL CLINTON. HE SAID IF THIS WERE DEMOCRATS, THE IMPEACHMENTS WOULD BE STARTING. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? WE GO TOO CRAZY ON BOTH SIDES. I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT THE SPECIAL PROSECUTORS HAVE TOO MUCH POWER. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE ENTIRE FORCE OF A TEAM OF 20 OR 30 LAWYERS THAT CAN INVESTIGATE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE FOR THE LAST 20 OR 30 YEARS BRING YOU IN TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND IF THEY CAN GET YOU TO MAKE A MISSTATEMENT ON SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T REMEMBER CORRECTLY THAT YOU CAN GO TO JAIL FOR THAT? IT'S A CRAZY SITUATION. WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE THESE SPECIAL PROSECUTORS.
