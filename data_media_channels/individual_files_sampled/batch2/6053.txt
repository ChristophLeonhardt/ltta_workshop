today is World Refugee day and to sort of commemorate it I want to take a two-pronged approach to it so the personal and the big picture on the current state of refugees internationally we're gonna get to the the the big picture but I want to start personal because YouTube had this great program where they sent a number of youtubers to refugee camps around the world to sort of provide a more detailed human personal look at the experiences of those people both in the US but mostly overseas and that TYT was lucky enough to to be a part of that so to watch eSports is Francis Maxwell was chosen to go to a refugee camp in Uganda film the number of videos that are available on both the Young Turks YouTube channel allso trt sports use YouTube channel which you should definitely watch I've seen them they're awesome we're gonna show you a couple of short teasers of these videos starting with this so I'm here in Uganda to look into the biti biti refugee settlement home to around 200,000 plus South Sudanese refugees so an astounding amount and probably you haven't heard much of it because let's be honest a lot of people are talking about it so believe what we're going is to the border one of which I think there is several entry points into Uganda but we're going to go and see where these South Sudanese refugees are coming from I don't know what I'm expecting it's people literally coming across the border after just flee in a circumstance you probably can't even imagine we'd have a little bit more for you so there he's there in Uganda but as I said I mean they were there were youtubers of a variety of different backgrounds not exclusively focused on politics going to refugee camps literally around the world and so it's a great program by there were some who did their videos in English - father son yeah I defy money I needed the subtitle version now great great work my friend um but I got balls a great abyss great work I'm gonna take credit for one of the few good things I've done here at this company although it didn't really matter in the end uh but Francis was working working here about a year uh and he got offered another job because he's his talent recognized and he talked to me about it and I went to Jack as I do this is the kind of person you gotta keep yet scramble you gotta keep this guy's got matters and I was like yeah I totally agree I'm already on it and now after seeing this he's gonna get a better ah yeah and I said and now yeah and I'm gonna do it again yeah no this was great this was as good if not and I said this to John Wall was happening and you may heard me speaking over but it was it is the best filmed thing I've ever seen from uh The Young Turks like sort of in the field reporting and I probably will get flack for that but I you know I there was a fun amazing really but yeah I didn't see the also stuff to be honest with you and I'm taking nothing from the Standing Rock stuff also that was fantastic a lot of what came out of Standing Rock but this was just sensitive and reporting and telling a story that no literally nobody else is telling I mean a the immigration that immigration can go well someplace that that they don't have the resources for all the immigrants uh and but they have the sentiment to help all the immigrants as opposed to the rest of the world where they have the resources but they yeah that's well that was starving yet to death Uganda yep right and they're the ones who reached out right to the South's enemies and what you know I actually would say it's the best of there's great stuff it's very good but it's very very good yeah one of the moments from us there was a the video onto it eSports is focused on uh basically that that the group of the refugees are playing soccer football you can attack me for both of us uh to sort of like it's a it's a distraction it's something to do it's a bonding exercise and uh the the Ugandan field was made available so two refugee teams could play against each other and an audience of Ugandan 's came to watch them play which and the point was made in the video but I'm not sure that in a lot of Western countries that's exact same outcome would have had no Francis I can you imagine New York City if a but tons thousands of New Yorkers went out to see Syrians play yeah I wouldn't I would like to assume that there would be some but by the way I was like though I will say Arsenal play Chelsea either in the in New York so that's fair so those names sound made-up ok let's go to this second clip from video I mean you talk to a lot of people I think they expected you have something at times to give them an accomplishment you can you can't give them anything to help it it's not a comfortable environment it makes me feel that when I report on these stories I'm kind of doing them an injustice even when I report on stories in Syria and I'm reporting it from what I've read and what I've seen but not from what I've experienced me now when you experience this since it's a completely different way of thinking what what is actually the process is not just a group of people these are actual people human beings that happen to be resettled in a yeah so before we move on to the stats though I have to say one thing so watching the footage and especially I don't know why I'm actually I don't like sports I'm more into the football one even because he talks to a couple of refugees about their experience everything it's very sad like if you're a human you have a beating heart you you're affected by that or at least most people are because the YouTube spotlight video that went up today and is sort of a montage of all of the different videos in France is actually a big part of it it went up and I'm sure the numbers have changed but as of the last time I checked it it had 40,000 likes and well over a hundred thousand dislikes and the comments were sort of where what's it on on YouTube on it's the YouTube official video about this web site where the comments are just pure Nazi rhetoric it's just attacking like just the YouTube spotlight is focused on a 13 year old girl who wants to be a rapper an old man who makes toys for refugee children and people have just exploded with a torrent of hatred and contempt and suspicion and xenophobia how important your overwhelming fear John you and I have talked about this before why honestly why do you need a comment section like why when they put something like this up here the does it matter because theoretically could start a discussion some discussions are more productive enough but discussions were started all the time but when when you saw dogs biting kids in in Birmingham uh in the Civil Rights Movement there was no comment section but people were were discussing people discussed things when they see them I think that YouTube has a lot of hope I think that it also the existence of Twitter and Facebook has rendered comment sections less meaningful I get the idea why they rounded up many other websites it seems to me and I don't know this but I read some story about uh a one news site that just stopped doing comments and a lot have food in that story was that many people are taking that approach there's no value it there are some videos like this of its World Refugee day take the comments out I mean you're showing they might well is yet it does happen uh yeah and look again it's it's somewhere on reddit or 4chan they posted a link to it and said go this is what you're spending your day on and I know it doesn't matter it's not a representative sample of anything it's just interesting that there is something about these like being filled with hatred and fear of everything outside of what you've experienced in your life seems to be very heavily correlate with having a lot of time to spend making comments online and and being filled with hope and love and all of that it's not as strongly correlate it seems like every is a lot of busy people who are filled with hate and contempt and disdain uh - and uh and uh uh Francis helpless feeling helpless there that was moving especially after the kids rejected his offering of pocket squares they just didn't they didn't know what to do ya know what I didn't understand and they remain into this right not dapper as we mark World Refugee day uh I was I went and I accumulated some facts about refugees I don't think a lot of people necessarily know I mean we've covered here at TYT a number of different components of the refugee crisis and when I was in Oslo interviewing a human rights activist several of them are directly done work for a particular components of the the refugee crisis but even I wasn't familiar with some of these stats like that more than half the refugees around the globe are under the age of 18 even though children make up just 31% of the world's population and so and that was true of the the video that we showed you from Uganda Uganda with Francis that I believe 86% of the refugees in that massive camp were women and children but of course the image you see from those who want to demonize refugees is not quite like that additionally a turkey remains the largest host of refugees globally with nearly 3 million living inside its borders Pakistan is second among the top ten host nations only one is a quote-unquote high-income country that's Germany at number eight with getting up there towards a million refugees and asylum seekers and I found this I found this to be so interesting that the the comparison of number of displaced people for every 1000 inhabitants I think this really drives home the image there that Sudan is at 219 to 3 per 1000 in the UK Canada and Australia and one of those two sets has more resources than the other I will let you do the research on which is which but isn't so sorry for put that graphic back up if the if they could because I might I want to make sure I so that Sudan is home to 219 displaced people for every 1000 inhabitants all right yes and we are Sudan South Sudan because these these that Francis over South Sudanese who are South Sudanese fleeing into you got not to yes and also and just to to make sure that people understand it so there's there's refugees and when you think about refugees I mean I hope you think about things like for instance the people crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa and the Middle East those populations people fleeing Syria and all that but there's also a lot of internal refugees and in 2016 there were forty point three million internally displaced persons around the world versus twenty five point three million refugees and so these are people whose lives have also been uprooted living in extremely hard situations but not necessarily getting the same sort of international recognition because they have stayed within what is quote-unquote their own their home country and some place I believe Colombia is home to millions just inside if that was the most surprising to me that which was number five is that Colombia leads the world in an highest number of IDPs internally displaced persons in the world we've covered a little bit of good news in the past a year or two there I don't know if it's proceeded in the way that uh that we hoped it would but I mean that's just that's an idea that zealots around civil war will do you just watch the video from the young turks did you know there's a live to our show every day if you're a member of the Young Turks you can get that on demand anytime you want without ads plus the postgame just for members plus aggressive progresses plus old school plus so many other Network shows go right now TYT Network comm slash join
