A GOP LAWMAKER THINKS IT'S A BAD
IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO GET
TREATED IF THEY GO TO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM.
IN FACT, SHE
THINKS THAT WE COULD SAVE
DOCTORS IN THIS WHOLE HEALTHCARE
SYSTEM A LOT OF MONEY IF WE
DIDN'T HAVE TO TREAT EVERYONE
THE SHUTTLE TO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM.
THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE
DIANE BLACK.
SHE IS IN
TENNESSEE AND SHE WAS SPEAKING
TO CHUCK TODD ABOUT THIS ISSUE
AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM
HER AND WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
TAKE A LOOK THAT.
YOU ARE BEING FORCED INTO
FIGURING OUT HOW TO
SUBSIDIZE THAT FREE HEALTHCARE
THAT NOBODY PAYS FOR AT THE
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR.
LET ME TELL YOU, CHUCK THAT I
AM AN EMERGENCY ROOM NURSE.
THEIR PEOPLE CAME INTO MY
EMERGENCY ROOM THAT I, THE NURSE
WAS THE FIRST ONE TO SEE THEM
THAT I COULD'VE SENT THEM TO A
WALK-IN CLINIC OR THEIR DOCTOR
THE NEXT DAY BUT BECAUSE OF A
LAW THAT CONGRESS PUT INTO PLACE
TO SAY NO, I HAVE TO TREAT
EVERYONE THAT WALKS INTO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM, YOU TOOK AWAY
OUR ABILITY TO SAY NO.
AN
EMERGENCY ROOM IS NOT THE
PROPER PLACE.
AND THEN HE PUT A BURDEN ON TOP
OF THAT TO SAY YOU MUST DO THAT.
AND YOU WOULD GET RID OF THE
LAW THAT MANDATES EMERGENCY
ROOMS TO SEE EVERY PATIENT THAT
SHOWS UP.
I WOULD GET RID OF A LAW THAT
SAYS YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED AS
A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL TO
MAKE THAT DECISION ABOUT
WHETHER SOMEONE CAN BE
APPROPRIATELY TREATED THE
NEXT DAY OR AT A WALK-IN CLINIC
OR AT THEIR DOCTOR.
SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF
ALL YOU HEARD WAS THAT YOU MIGHT
WALK AWAY THINKING, THAT SEEMS
REASONABLE.
THAT IS A PERSON
WHO PRACTICED THIS AS A NURSE
AND KNOWS WHAT IT IS AND SHE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE HER
JUDGMENT AND IF SOMEBODY
CAME IN WITH THE FLU YOU COULD
SAY HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
COME TO THE CLINIC TOMORROW
INSTEAD OF TAKING UP SPACE IN
THE EMERGENCY ROOM.
BUT THAT'S
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF
IT AND AS A CONGRESSWOMAN NOW
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, SHE SHOULD
KNOW IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND
THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD FLOW
FROM IT.
THE PERSON WHO
ACTUALLY SIGNED THE LAW INTO THE
EFFECT WAS A WELL-KNOWN LIBERAL
NAMED RONALD REAGAN.
IT WAS THE
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND
ACTIVE LABOR ACT.
I'M GOING TO
PSYCHOACTIVE LABOR IN THE SECOND
BUT THE REASON THEY DID IT IS
BECAUSE BACK IN THE DAY
HOSPITALS WOULD DO WITH A CALLED
PATIENT DUMPING.
SOMEONE
WALKING TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEY
WOULD GO HE DOESN'T HAVE
INSURANCE AND IT IS GOING TO
COST A LOT AND THEY WOULD JUST
REFUSE TO TREAT HIM AND THEY
WOULD EITHER JUST DRIVE THEM OUT
TO THE STREET AND SAY GOODBYE
AND GOOD LUCK OR THEY WOULD MAKE
IT THIS DIFFERENT HOSPITAL TAKE
THEM AND THEY KEPT DOING THIS
PATIENT DUMPING TO THE POINT
THAT CONGRESS HAD TO PASS THE
LAW AND REAGAN SIGNED INTO
EFFECT.
SO BEFORE YOU GO
RUNNING AROUND TALKING ABOUT,
THEY TOOK MY FREEDOM AWAY TO
DENY YOU HEALTHCARE.
LOOK INTO
IT A LITTLE BIT AND FIND OUT,
NORMALLY I THINK OF THE LAWS
OUTRAGEOUS, THERE MUST'VE BEEN A
GOOD REASON FOR THAT MAYBE AT
SOME POINT, LET ME FIND OUT WHY
DOTS AND SHE DIDN'T OF COURSE DO
THAT AND ACTIVE LABOR PART IS
BECAUSE WOMEN WOULD, IN PREGNANT
IN THE MIDDLE OF LABOR AND
HOSPITALS WOULD DUMP THEM ANYWAY
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE
AND SO THAT IS WHY EVEN THE
PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT WAS LIKE THAT
IS A FETUS.
THAT IS THE ONE
THING WE CARE ABOUT.
AND YOU ARE SENDING THEM AWAY IN
THE MIDDLE OF LABOR?
THAT CAN COST OR MEND HIS
PROBLEM SO THAT IS WHERE
THEY PASS THE LAWN
THE FIRST PLACE.
THAT IS WHY THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY.
YOU ARE GIVING HER THE
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IN SAYING
THAT MAYBE SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE
HISTORY OF WHY THIS LAW WASN'T
ACTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT I
THINK EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY
SOMEONE WHO'S A CURRENT LAWMAKER
KNOWS THAT EMERGENCY ROOM'S END
UP SERVING AS A LAST RESORT FOR
THE POOR WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO PROVIDE OR PAY FOR
HEALTHCARE, WHO HAVEN'T HAD
ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND
SO THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS GET
SO BAD THAT THEY END UP IN
EMERGENCY ROOMS.
YEAH, THEY
SHOULD BE SEEN BY DOCTORS IF
THEY SHOW UP TO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM AND LOOK, MAYBE I AM TOO
REAL AND MAYBE I SEE THE DARK
SIDE OF HUMANITY A LITTLE TOO
MUCH BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO
BE THE ARBITER OF WHETHER OR NOT
SOMEONE DESERVES CARE THAT
MOMENT.
SO SHE BRINGS UP
SOMEONE WHO HAS A SORE THROAT
FOR A WEEK OR SOMEONE WHOM I
HAVE THE FLU BUT I AM NOT BUYING
FOR A SECOND THAT THOSE ARE THE
ONLY INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE
TURNED AWAY.
WE ALL KNOW THAT
MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE TURNED AWAY
FOR MORE SERIOUS CONDITIONS AND
SOMETIMES YOU GO TO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU AND MAYBE
THE SYMPTOMS DON'T SEEM THAT
SERIOUS TO THE PERSON YOU ARE
DESCRIBING IT TO THAT IT MIGHT
END UP BEING SOMETHING
INCREDIBLY SERIOUS.
WHAT IF YOU JUST GOT HIT IN THE
HEAD AND YOU ARE WORRIED
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SUFFER A
CONCUSSION?
THESE ARE THINGS YOU SHOULD BE
TREATED FOR AND SO WHEN YOU KNOW
THE HISTORY AND WHEN YOU KNOW
THAT DEMOGRAPHIC THAT TYPICALLY
ENDS UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM,
YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THAT LAW
WASN'T ACTED IN THE FIRST PLACE
BUT BY THE WAY, ANOTHER THING I
WANTED TO STAY IS THAT IF YOU
ARE A HOSPITAL THAT IS NOT
RECEIVING ANY MEDICARE FUNDS,
YOU CAN TURN PEOPLE AWAY.
IT IS
TO SIT IF YOU ARE RECEIVING
TAXPAYER MONEY, YOU CAN'T DO IT.
YOU CAN'T TURN IT AWAY.
SO IF
YOU ARE GENUINELY AGAINST THIS
TYPE OF LAW AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO ABIDE BY IT THEN STOP
RECEIVING MEDICARE MONEY AND
THEN HE CAN GO AHEAD AND
PATIENT.
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.
HERE IN LA AND OUR HEALTHCARE
PLAN WE HAVE URGENT CARE AS
OPPOSED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.
IS FOR LIGHTER STUFF THAT
HAPPENS TO YOU AND I LOVE IT
BECAUSE EVERYBODY OF COURSE
KNOWS THE LINES IN THE EMERGENCY
ROOM.
IT'S A REAL HASSLE.
WE
KNOW THAT THAT IS A REAL ISSUE
SO URGENT CARE HAS COME UP NOW
AND THAT'S MUCH BETTER IN THE
SYSTEM.
SO WE'RE NOT SAYING
THAT THE LINES IN THE EMERGENCY
ROOM ARE NOT AN ISSUE BUT
REMEMBER, IT'S NOT LIKE THE
TREATMENT REQUIRES YOU TO TAKE
SEVEN HOURS WITH THE PERSON.
THEY JUST HAVE A SORE THROAT AND
THEY SAT THERE WHATEVER THEY HAD
TO SIT THROUGH AND THEY GOT TO
YOU SAY OKAY IS A BILL FOR YOUR
THROAT AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE MANDATED
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.
IN FACT,
IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE YOU
ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
TO DISMISS THAT.
BECAUSE HOW DO
YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE A SORE
THROAT OR THEY DON'T.
WHICH LEADS TO THE STORY OF MINE
WHICH IS PRETTY TRAGIC.
REALLY
GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.
FATHER OF
HIS WAS IN TURKEY AND EXISTENCE
OF WHAT COULD GO WRONG.
HIS
FATHER WAS INVOLVED IN AN
ACCIDENT AND THE DOCTORS LOOKED
AT HIM AND THOUGHT HE WAS FINE.
IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE
NEGLIGENT.
HE WASN'T FINE.
HE HAD INTERNAL BLEEDING AND HE
DIED.
SO THAT IS WHY, WHEN YOU
GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM YES,
SOMEONE SHOULD TAKE A COUPLE
MINUTES OUT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE
OKAY AND NOT DUMP YOU ON THE
STREETS AND GO I AM USING MY
GOOD JUDGMENT TO MAKE SURE I
DON'T TREAT YOU.
THAT IS NOT
THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE SHOULD
BE.
