1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,524
>> Tucker: WE JUST HAD A

2
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:14,597
CONVERSATION WITH PAMELA

3
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:18,201
ANDERSON ABOUT JULIAN ASSANGE

4
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:21,004
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN.

5
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:25,475
THEN UBER AND LYFT IS POPULAR

6
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:26,342
WITH THE PUBLIC.

7
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:33,282
SHE IS CAMPAIGNING AGAINST RIDE

8
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:37,153
SHARING APPS.

9
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:38,721
LURING DRIVERS AND EXPLOITING

10
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:39,288
THEM.

11
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:41,057
TELL US WHAT YOU MEAN?

12
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:42,458
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS THE

13
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,361
DIFFICULTIES THEY ARE OCCURRING.

14
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,697
PEOPLE ARE BEING SEXUALLY

15
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:48,064
ASSAULTED.

16
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:49,966
THE DRIVERS ARE EXPLOITED.

17
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,802
THEY ARE HIRED AS 3rd-PARTY

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,369
PROVIDERS.

19
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,204
UBER IS NOT TAKING

20
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:57,106
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF THEIR

21
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:58,808
WRONG DOINGS.

22
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,344
ALSO THEY ARE NOT GETTING HEALTH

23
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,812
CARE OR ANY OF THE THINGS THEY

24
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,214
SHOULD BE RECEIVING AS

25
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:05,581
EMPLOYEES.

26
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,016
>> Tucker: I AM CONFUSED.

27
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:11,087
THE PEOPLE WHO RUN UBER ARE

28
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:12,255
SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS AND GOOD

29
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:12,822
PEOPLE.

30
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,857
THEY SAY THEY ARE VERY GOOD

31
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,125
PEOPLE AND RICH.

32
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,127
WHY WOULDN'T THEY PAY FOR THEIR

33
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:19,662
HEALTH CARE FOR THE DRIVERS?

34
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,663
>> EXACTLY.

35
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,766
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE FACT FOR.

36
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:29,605
ALSO YOU WILL GET BETTER EQUAL

37
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:29,939
DRIVERS.

38
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,307
MORE QUALIFIED DRIVERS.

39
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:34,077
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE REAL BENEFITS

40
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:35,211
AND MINIMUM WAGE.

41
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:35,945
>> Tucker: I DON'T UNDERSTAND

42
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,213
WHY NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT

43
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:37,513
THIS.

44
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:39,482
IF A FACTORY WERE PAYING PEOPLE

45
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:42,218
WHAT UBER PAYS PER HOUR AND NOT

46
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,821
PAYING FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE --

47
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,155
WELL, WAL-MART DID IT.

48
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:47,623
PEOPLE SAID THIS WAS

49
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:49,692
EXPLOITATION BUT UBER GETS A

50
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:49,992
PASS.

51
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:50,259
WHY?

52
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,661
>> IT'S TECHNOLOGY AND

53
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,061
EVOLUTION.

54
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:54,630
WE HAVE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS.

55
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,800
I SAY IF YOU ARE A SEXUAL

56
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,037
OFFENDER, YOU SHOULD GET A JOB

57
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,073
AT UBER.

58
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:07,677
>> Tucker: YOU ARE NOT FOR UBER?

59
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,244
>> NO.

60
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:16,285
I AM NOT FOR THESE RIDE HAIL

61
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:16,586
APPS.

62
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,888
YOU ARE SENDING STRANGERS TO

63
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,623
PICK UP CHILDREN OR A LATE NIGHT

64
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:25,228
OUT AND DRINKING TOO MUCH.

65
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,265
IT'S AN AP, PEOPLE THINK IT'S

66
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:29,565
SAFE.

67
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:30,933
IT IS NOT SAFE.

68
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,770
IT HAS BUGS TO WORK OUT AND THEY

69
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,238
NEED PROPER PAYMENT TO THE

70
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:35,772
DRIVERS.

71
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,974
ANYBODY CAN BE AN UBER DRIVER.

72
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:40,176
THEY HAVE TO FINE-TUNE THAT.

73
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:43,146
>> Tucker: ARE YOU SAYING THE

74
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,181
BILLIONAIRES WHO RUN UBER ARE SO

75
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,349
GREEDY, THEY WON'T TAKE

76
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,051
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR

77
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:49,418
EMPLOYEES?

78
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,787
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE FINDING

79
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:51,954
ALL OF THESE LOOP HOLES.

80
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:55,324
THEY HAVE TO TIGHTEN IT UP.

81
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:58,828
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED

82
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:00,496
LIKE THIS.

83
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,398
THE EMPLOYEES AND THE DRIVER.

84
00:03:02,398 --> 00:00:00,000
THE DRIVERS ARE THE CORE OF THE
