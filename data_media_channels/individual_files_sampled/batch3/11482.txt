the death toll from a suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital has risen to 48 and is likely to rise further that's according to local health officials 67 others were injured in the attack on an education center in a Shiite neighbourhood of Kabul no one has yet claimed responsibility this comes after reports of at least 45 security personnel being killed after the Taliban attacked a military camp north of Kabul local journalist Sultan Fozzy reports it has been a very deadly day for Afghanistan it's a very bloody day for Afghanistan not only in northern Afghanistan but also in eastern Afghanistan some 12 at least 12 aana soldiers have been killed and three are missing but in Babylon province specifically in in the location were still it's there are conflicting reports that you know all 45 people or Afghan security forces have been killed but speaking earlier - a spokesperson for the northern corpse he didn't confirm the death of the A&A soldiers he said that 28 soldiers were there and they're missing then they have lost connection and they tried to send reinforcements but they have been also ambushed many people have been actually you know have have been you know questioning the management of the security forces that what happened they doing so basically falling you know post-2014 they have been only involved in coalition forces on only involved in training assist and advise mission basically they are not on the ground but there have been you know conducting airstrikes that have been causing sometimes civilian casualties this is the latest in a string of Taliban attacks heavy clashes between the militant group in the country security forces erupted last week I saw my friend dying he was among 13 people including children and women who were killed during an air strike last night there is no attention from the government no facilities for the residents dead bodies are still on the road sites joining me live now to discuss this further is Jamar Joaquin professor of history and international relations at the Lebanese University in Beirut good to have you with us mr. Joaquin now according to different sources the Taliban now controls from between 14 to about 50% of Afghan territory given that it control only one percent as a result of the u.s. invasion in 2001 what has gone wrong here well I believe that it was mainly the efforts of the United States to antagonize countries that are neighbouring to Afghanistan like China Russia and Iran in addition to its role to destabilize the regime or to destabilize Pakistan that have enabled the Taliban to maneuver to win a wide space of maneuverability especially that back in 2001 2002 the United States was only capable of pacifying the country through the logistical and intelligence provided to it by these neighboring countries to Afghanistan in an attempt to fight terrorism so now that the United States is antagonizing all these countries in addition to its withdrawing economic support to the Afghani government due to austerity measures in the United States I believe that this have given the opportunity to the Taliban to strike back and to take control of wide areas of Afghanistan we're seeing some critics to parallels between Afghanistan and the now infamous US campaign in Vietnam is that something you would agree with do you see it too well this is a comparison to be drawn but I would also compare the the crisis that is facing the United States in Afghanistan now to that to the crisis that faced the Soviet Union before the United States back in the 1980s and even before that the crises that have faced the British attempts to pacify the country and control it back in the late 19th century and early 20th century so I believe that Afghanistan have been the graveyard of big empires and it might be also the graveyard of the American Empire because I don't believe or I don't see any prospect of success for the Americans in that country Mr McKay me is it the case that the longer the war drags on the better it becomes for the Taliban definitely because the United States is being involved in too many crises it's be its resources are being drained and at the same time it's antagonizing Russia China Iran even Pakistan India and other countries and in its attempt to maintain its hegemony over global affairs but this is exhausting the the United States and I believe that it's leading it to over extension the way that was stated by by the historian Paul Kennedy in his famous book the rise and fall of great empires so I believe that the United States is being overstretched and it might lead to a big crisis within this country and of course its role worldwide what eventual outcome do you think we can expect from this long drawn-out conflict well I believe that this will lead to further chaos in Afghanistan at the same time we don't see a willingness of the United States to cooperate with Iran Russia or China which might which makes the situation even worse and at the time when instability is rampant in Pakistan itself due to the political crisis this will further deteriorate into a complete chaos in the country in Afghanistan professor of history and international relations at the Lebanese University in Beirut Jamal Joaquin thank you for your time you
