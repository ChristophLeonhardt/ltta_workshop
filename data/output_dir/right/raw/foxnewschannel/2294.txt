00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,177
MARK: HELLO, AMERICA, I'M MARK

00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:14,878
LEVIN, AND THIS IS "LIFE,

LIBERTY & LEVIN," AND IT'S AN

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,314
HONOR TO HAVE DR. DAVID

6
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:17,881
BERLINSKI WITH US.

7
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:19,450
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,251
>> I'M JUST FINE, THANK YOU FOR

9
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:21,652
HAVING ME.

10
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:22,753
MARK: THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL

11
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:25,656
THE WAY FROM PARIS TO OUR

12
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:26,190
LITTLE PLACE.

13
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,857
>> WAS ENDLESS.

14
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:28,492
MARK: OKAY, IMAGINE 100 YEARS

15
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:28,759
AGO.

16
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:30,227
THAT WAS ENDLESS.

17
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:31,462
>> IT WAS WORSE.

18
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:32,329
MY TRIP WAS WORSE.

19
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:33,530
MARK: DAVID BERLINSKI.

20
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,467
I WANT TO TALK TODAY WITH YOU

21
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,335
IN YOUR UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO

22
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:41,338
DO THIS, ABOUT EVOLUTION,

23
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:43,207
SCIENCE AND PROGRESSIVISM

24
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,441
BECAUSE THERE'S A LINK.

25
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,609
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS AND

26
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,611
SPOKEN ABOUT THIS MANY, MANY

27
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,011
TIMES.

28
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:50,581
YOU RECEIVED YOUR Ph.D. IN

29
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,483
PHILOSOPHY FROM PRINCETON

30
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:52,883
UNIVERSITY.

31
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:56,520
LATER A POST DOCTORAL FELLOW IN

32
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,588
MATHEMATICS AND MOLECULAR

33
00:00:57,588 --> 00:00:59,323
BIOLOGY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

34
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:06,697
GLAD I DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE

35
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:07,030
COURSES.

36
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,566
YOU TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY,

37
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,668
MATHEMATICS, ENGLISH AT

38
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:12,970
STANFORD, RUTGERS, UNIVERSITY

39
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,639
OF NEW YORK AND IN PARIS AND

40
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,107
THE EDITOR OF INFERENCE

41
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:17,841
INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF

42
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:18,208
SCIENCE.

43
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,378
LET'S GET STARTED. YOU WROTE A

44
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:23,213
BOOK ABOUT A DECADE AGO THEY

45
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,849
READ ABOUT A DECADE AGO.

46
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,985
AND IN DOING THIS PROGRAM, I

47
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:28,719
STARTED TO THINK ABOUT IT, AND

48
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,988
I SAID, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

49
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:32,489
THAT WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION

50
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,726
ABOUT SCIENCE, EVOLUTION,

51
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:37,394
PROGRESSIVISM, AND I WANT TO

52
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:38,929
START WHERE YOU STARTED.

53
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:41,498
LET ME READ YOU ONE PARAGRAPH.

54
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:44,568
"I'M A SECULAR JEW, YOU WRITE.

55
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:47,037
MY RELIGIOUS EDUCATION DID NOT

56
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:47,337
TAKE.

57
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,173
I CAN BARELY REMEMBER A WORD OF

58
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:51,008
HEBREW, I CANNOT PRAY.

59
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:52,309
I'VE SPENT MORE YEARS THAN I

60
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,512
CARE TO REMEMBER IN STUDYING

61
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:56,246
MATHEMATICS AND WRITING ABOUT

62
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:57,848
THE SCIENCES.

63
00:01:57,848 --> 00:01:59,316
YET, AS YOU WROTE IN THE

64
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:01,084
PREFACE OF THIS BOOK, THE BOOK

65
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:03,287
THAT FOLLOWS IS IN SOME SENSE A

66
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:04,354
DEFENSE OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT

67
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:06,089
AND SENTIMENT.

68
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,391
BIBLICAL VERSES ARE THE LEAST

69
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,460
OF IT, A DEFENSE IS NEEDED

70
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,929
BECAUSE NONE HAS BEEN

71
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:12,329
FORTHCOMING.

72
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:14,798
THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN CEDED

73
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:17,134
TO MEN WHO REGARD RELIGIOUS

74
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:18,936
BELIEF WITH FRIVOLOUS CONTEMPT.

75
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:21,271
THE BOOKS HAVE POURED FROM

76
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,473
EVERY PRESS AND DIFFERING

77
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:24,508
WIDELY IN STYLE, THEY ARE

78
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:25,976
IDENTICAL IN MESSAGE BECAUSE

79
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:27,277
SCIENTIFIC THEORIES ARE TRUE

80
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,680
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, MUST BE

81
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,280
FALSE.

82
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,816
FROM YOUR BOOK "THE DEVIL'S

83
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,051
DELUSION," ATHEISM AND

84
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,252
SCIENTIFIC PRETENSIONS.

85
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,287
AND THAT IS THE THESIS, THAT IS

86
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:41,024
THE FOUNDATIONAL POINT OF YOUR

87
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,358
BOOK.

88
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:44,761
YOU CAN EXPAND ON THAT?

89
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,798
>> WELL, SOMETHING, SOMETHING

90
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,734
PARTICULAR AND PECULIAR SEEMS

91
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:55,038
TO HAVE COME OVER ANGLOAMERICAN

92
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:56,073
INTELLECTUAL LIFE IN.

93
00:02:56,073 --> 00:03:00,777
THE 1950s AND THE 60s, THE

94
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:03,914
POSITION THAT WAS ACADEMICALLY

95
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:06,216
TOLERATED WAS A CHEERFUL

96
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:08,285
AGNOSTISSISM WITH RESPECT TO

97
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,954
GOD'S EXISTENCE, MAYBE, MAYBE

98
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:14,458
NOD, BUT THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE

99
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,960
THAT VEXES US AS PROFOUNDLY AS

100
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,828
MEMBERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC

101
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:21,532
COMMUNITY AT ALL CHANGES.

102
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,268
NOW VERY VOCIFEROUS AND

103
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:28,388
DOGMATIC ATH

104
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:29,373
DOGMATIC AT

105
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:32,776
DOGMATIC ATHEISM IS OBLIGATORY,

106
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,177
ESTABLISHED PHYSICALISTS MAY BE

107
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:37,614
PLANNING JIHAD, I HAVE NO IDEA.

108
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:42,653
BUT BY AND LARGE, ATHEISM HAS

109
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:46,757
REPLACED FOREBEARING

110
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:49,760
AGONISTISSISM IN THE

111
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,928
ANGLO-AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC LIFE.

112
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:52,229
AND AS A RESULT, THE RELIGIOUS

113
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,098
TRADITION IS A VERY, VERY LONG

114
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,733
5,000-YEAR-OLD TRADITION HAS

115
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,971
BEEN MADE INTO AN OBJECT OF

116
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,140
FAINT DERISION AMONG

117
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,107
SOPHISTICATED MEN AND WOMEN

118
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:05,375
MUCH TO THE CONSTERNATION OF

119
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,311
PEOPLE WHO DEEPLY, DEEPLY

120
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,111
ADMIRE THAT TRADITION, AND

121
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:11,949
THAT, I THINK, IS A CHANGE IN

122
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:16,687
THE DIOPACIN OF LIFE THAT WE

123
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,255
NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO.

124
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,156
IT IS RELATIVELY NEW, STARTED

125
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:24,394
AROUND 1980, '85 BUT BECOME AN

126
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:25,295
ACCELERATING FORCE IN INTLECK

127
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:25,996
WAL LIFE.

128
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:29,299
IF YOU ARE MINDED TO BE A

129
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:34,071
SERIOUS CHRISTIAN OR EXTREMELY

130
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:37,140
DEVOUT AND ORTHODOX JEW OR EVEN

131
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,977
A SERIOUS MUSLIM, BETTER NOT GO

132
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:41,144
INTO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

133
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,713
AND TELL YOUR FRATERNITY

134
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:44,281
BROTHERS THAT THAT IS WHAT YOU

135
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:45,148
ARE.

136
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,650
BEST TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH CLOSED.

137
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,853
THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE, IT'S

138
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:52,656
AMONG THE VARIOUS TOPICS ABOUT

139
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,958
WHICH IT IS NOT A PARTICULARLY

140
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,995
GOOD IDEA TO MAKE BROADCAST

141
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,229
YOUR VIEWS.

142
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,831
MARK: AND THEN YOU ADD

143
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:11,308
FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR POINT --

144
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:35,732
AND YOU SAY BASICALLY SCIENCE

145
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:36,900
IS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT LIFE

146
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,737
AND LOVE AND DEATH AND MEANING.

147
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,205
>> HARDLY A CONTROVERSIAL

148
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,006
POINT, IS IT?

149
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:45,542
I MEAN, IF I AM ASKING CERTAIN

150
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,943
KINDS OF QUESTIONS.

151
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:48,545
LOOK, LOOK AROUND YOU.

152
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:50,347
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

153
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:53,583
OPEN YOUR EYES, YOU'RE STRUCK

154
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,751
BY THE EXISTENCE OF THE

155
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,953
UNIVERSE.

156
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:58,522
WHY IS THAT THERE?

157
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,857
LOOK AT THE ANSWERS FORTHCOMING

158
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:01,958
FROM THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY.

159
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,427
THEY CAN BE DESCRIBED IN ONE OF

160
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:04,394
TWO WAYS.

161
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:05,996
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

162
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:06,797
WE'RE HERE.

163
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:07,931
THEREFORE THERE IS SOMETHING

164
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:08,231
THERE.

165
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:09,566
OR IT'S KIND OF AN ACCIDENT.

166
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,902
THESE ARE NOT THE KIND OF

167
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,236
ANSWERS INTELLIGENT MEN AND

168
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:17,474
WOMEN ARE SEARCHING FOR.

169
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:21,378
THEY CORRESPOND TO NO DEEP

170
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:24,081
INTELLECTUAL NEED, THEY'RE

171
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:24,715
FRIVOLOUS.

172
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,016
PHYSICS HAS NOTHING TO TELL US,

173
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:27,451
FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT THE ORIGINS

174
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:28,985
AND APPEARANCE OF THE UNIVERSE.

175
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:30,554
IT HAS A LOT OF INTERESTING

176
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:33,590
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT COSMOLOGY

177
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,559
BUT NOT THE SAME QUESTION.

178
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,327
THE MOST RADICAL QUESTION YOU

179
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:40,764
CAN ASK IS: WHY IS THERE

180
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:42,432
SOMETHING, ANYTHING RATHER THAN

181
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,333
WHAT, NOTHING?

182
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,935
WHY IS THAT?

183
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,369
IT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE TO

184
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,106
PROPOSE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN

185
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:50,807
NOTHING WHATSOEVER.

186
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,210
I DON'T MEAN SOME PREEXISTING

187
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,510
STUFF.

188
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,144
I MEAN NOTHING.

189
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:55,378
WELL, THAT'S NOT THE WORLD WE

190
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:56,012
LIVE IN.

191
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,047
HOW COME?

192
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:58,315
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

193
00:06:58,315 --> 00:06:59,082
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

194
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:02,119
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PHYSICISTS

195
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,522
OR THE BIOLOGIST OR THE

196
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,157
CHEMIST, THEIR ANSWER IS, WE

197
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:09,092
KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

198
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,027
WE OPEN OUR EYES, TOO.

199
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:11,595
THERE'S SOMETHING.

200
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,063
AND WE CAN EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN

201
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:15,198
OF ALL THAT BY APPEALING TO

202
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:17,167
SOME PREEXISTING SOMETHING.

203
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,468
ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT?

204
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,873
IF NOT, WELL, YOU'RE NOT

205
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:26,276
SCIENTIFIC LITERATE.

206
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:28,879
LAWRENCE KRAUS MAKES THAT

207
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,481
ARGUMENT, THE PREEXISTING

208
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:34,417
QUANTUM FIELD FROM WHICH IT

209
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:34,718
AROSE.

210
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:35,952
MARK: THEY HAVE NO REAL SOLID

211
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:37,154
IDEA DO, THEY?

212
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:37,988
>> NONE, WHATSOEVER.

213
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:40,490
MARK: AND YET, THEY CONTINUE TO

214
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,125
PUSH THEIR THEORIES OUT AS IF

215
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:42,826
IT'S SCIENCE.

216
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:44,094
>> WELL, LET'S BE FAIR,

217
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:45,362
WOULDN'T YOU DO THE SAME THING

218
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,631
IF YOU WERE A LEADING -- I SURE

219
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:47,931
WOULD.

220
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,667
IF I HAD A THEORY THAT DEEP

221
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,669
DOWN I KNEW NO GOOD, BUT THERE

222
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,007
ARE SORTS OF EMOLUMENTS,

223
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,142
RICHNESS, AWARD, PRESTIGIOUS, I

224
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:00,343
WOULD PUSH IT, DO I.

225
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:03,580
MARK: WE GET THE ARGUMENTS

226
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,981
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE THE

227
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,917
SAME SCIENTISTS CAN'T TELL.

228
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,852
>> YOU TALKING ABOUT THE TOP

229
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:09,252
PHYSICISTS.

230
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,288
CLIMATE CHANGE, YOU HAVE TO GO

231
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:12,856
DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE

232
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:13,190
BOTTOM.

233
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,624
MARK: FOR A LOT OF US, IT'S

234
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,126
JUST A MUSH OUT THERE.

235
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,327
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE SAYING

236
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:19,629
THE TOP PHYSICISTS AND WHAT I'M

237
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,832
SAYING IS, WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK

238
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:24,201
AT CLIMATE CHANGE, WE HAVE A

239
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,802
COMMUNITY THAT CAN'T TELL US

240
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:27,437
THE TEMPERATURE IN A WEEK

241
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:29,172
WITHIN 10 DEGREES, BUT THEY CAN

242
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:32,976
TELL US THE TEMPERATURE IN 100

243
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:36,279
YEARS WITHIN ONE DEGREE.

244
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,746
WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU SAYING

245
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,616
THE TOP PHYSICISTS.

246
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:41,284
ISN'T IT PERVASIVE?

247
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:42,852
ISN'T THIS A PERVASIVE PROBLEM

248
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:43,720
THROUGHOUT SCIENCE?

249
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,322
>> TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

250
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,591
LOOK, SCIENCE IS AN ENORMOUS

251
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:48,325
ENTERPRISE.

252
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:51,127
HOW MANY GUYS, HOW MANY WOMEN,

253
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,129
MEN AND WOMEN AFFIRM THEMSELVES

254
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,798
AS SCIENTISTS WORLDWIDE TODAY?

255
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,833
DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE THE

256
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,234
NUMBER?

257
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,068
IT'S SEVEN MILLION.

258
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:59,903
SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE

259
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,871
ENGAGED IN THE SCIENTIFIC

260
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:01,438
ENTERPRISE.

261
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:03,940
AND, OF COURSE, YOU ARE GOING

262
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,143
TO FIND VERY REPETITIVE

263
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,511
SOCIOLOGICAL PATTERNS WHEN

264
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:10,013
THERE IS SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT

265
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:11,214
AS ENVIRONMENT OR CLIMATE,

266
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:13,283
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND GROUPS

267
00:09:13,283 --> 00:09:14,818
FORMING FACTIONS SPLITTING FROM

268
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:19,222
THE GROUP, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

269
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:21,524
OF PROPAGANDA.

270
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:23,660
ELABORATE NUMBER OF RESOURCES,

271
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,095
A LOT OF MONEY TO BE HAD, NOT

272
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,763
COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR,

273
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,832
IT'S COMING FROM THE FEDERAL

274
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:29,232
GOVERNMENT.

275
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:30,667
WHEN I TALK ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL

276
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:31,835
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF

277
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:34,638
THE UNIVERSE, WE'RE APPEALING

278
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:36,206
TO THE VERY TOP OF THE

279
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:37,173
INTELLECTUAL LADDER.

280
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:39,009
WHEN I TALK ABOUT CLIMATE

281
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:39,843
CHANGE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

282
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:43,213
SOME COMPETENT PEOPLE, NOT

283
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:44,714
MANY, SOME COMPETENT PEOPLE

284
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,450
WITH MODERATELY CONFLICTING

285
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,752
VIEWS, BOTH ABOUT THE ORIGINS

286
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:50,287
OF CLIMATE CHANGE, YES, THE

287
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:52,589
WORLD IS GETTING WARMER.

288
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,691
THE NATURE OF CLIMATE CHANGE,

289
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:56,459
THE RELIABILITY OF THE

290
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,128
CLIMACTIC MODELS, THE THEORIES

291
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,497
THAT GO INTO THEM AND

292
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:03,199
PROGNOSTICATIONS FOR THE

293
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:04,267
FUTURE.

294
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,970
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR EXACTLY

295
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,406
WHICH GROUP HAS THE MOST

296
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:10,907
OVERWHELMING AND PERSUASIVE

297
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:11,274
EVIDENCE.

298
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:12,375
MARK: WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT

299
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,710
THE TOP.

300
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,314
IF YOU THINK THIS FELLOW, AT

301
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,082
LEAST ARGUABLY, DARWIN, A LOT

302
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:22,319
OF THEORIES, ARGUMENTS,

303
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,520
SCIENCE, SO TO SPEAK WHAT IS

304
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,888
DARWINISM.

305
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:25,789
WHAT IS THAT?

306
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:28,625
>> DARWIN COMES MID 19th

307
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,395
CENTURY FIGURE, 1859, HE

308
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:34,531
PUBLISHED WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE

309
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,066
MASTERPIECE, THE ORIGIN OF

310
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,534
SPECIES AND THE QUESTION THAT

311
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:38,435
DARWIN ASKED HIMSELF IS A

312
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:39,903
QUESTION THAT ALL THE 19th

313
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:41,371
CENTURY BIOLOGISTS WERE ASKING,

314
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,373
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF LIFE?

315
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:44,741
WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF

316
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:46,476
INDIVIDUAL SPECIES?

317
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:49,045
HOW DID LIFE EMERGE FROM

318
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:49,612
INORGANIC MATTER?

319
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:52,349
AND WHAT ARE THE DYNAMIC LAWS

320
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:54,384
THAT CHANGE ONE SPECIES INTO

321
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,152
ANOTHER, IF THERE IS SUCH A

322
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:59,055
THING AS A CHANGE OF SPECIES.

323
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,691
DON'T FORGET ALCHEMY PROMOTED A

324
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:04,394
VERY SIMILAR THESIS WHEN IT

325
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,896
SAID BASE METALS COULD BE

326
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:07,764
TRANSMUTED INTO GOLD.

327
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:09,232
AN ARGUMENT FOR TRANSMUTATION

328
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:11,234
OF ELEMENTS.

329
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:14,571
DARWIN PROVIDED AN ALCHEMICAL

330
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:15,472
EXPLANATION FOR BIOLOGY.

331
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:17,273
SPECIES COULD BE TRANSFORMED

332
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:18,408
INTO OTHER SPECIES.

333
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,410
HOW COULD THIS COME ABOUT?

334
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,412
WE DON'T SEE IT EVERY DAY.

335
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:23,446
IT COMES ABOUT BECAUSE THERE

336
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:25,181
ARE SMALL VARIATIONS WITHIN

337
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,983
EACH SPECIES AND THESE

338
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:28,685
VARIATIONS ARE SEIZED UPON BY

339
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:29,819
THE MECHANISM OF NATURAL

340
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,421
SELECTION WHICH SIMPLY MEANS

341
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:35,158
SOME SURVIVE, SOME DON'T

342
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:35,492
SURVIVE.

343
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,227
OVER VAST PERIODS OF TIME,

344
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,496
THESE SMALL VARIATIONS

345
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,664
ACCUMULATE, THEY CONVERGE ON A

346
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:43,199
DIFFERENT STRUCTURE AND VARIOUS

347
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,369
DIFFERENT STRUCTURES IN TURN

348
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:52,342
CONVERGE ON A NEW BODY, PLANT,

349
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:52,492
ORG

350
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:52,876
OR

351
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:54,978
ORGANISM OF SPECIES, THAT'S

352
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:56,379
DARWINISM AND IT'S A POSITION

353
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,281
WHICH IS BEING INCREASINGLY

354
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:03,920
HELD AS A SECULAR DOCTRINE.

355
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,422
COMPARABLE, COMPARABLE TO THE

356
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:06,222
BOOK OF GENESIS.

357
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:07,390
MARK: IS HE RIGHT?

358
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,059
>> I HAVE A LOT OF DOUBTS, I

359
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,161
HAVE A LOT OF DOUBTS AND SO DO

360
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:12,662
OTHER PEOPLE.

361
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:13,897
THERE ARE MANY, MANY PLACES

362
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:17,267
WHEN ONE LOOKS AT DARWINISM,

363
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:18,802
SOME SAYS LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE

364
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,470
SCIENTIFIC THEORY, IT'S A

365
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,306
COLLECTION OF ANECDOTES.

366
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,008
WHY DID THE GIRAFFE DEVELOP

367
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,276
SUCH A LONG NECK?

368
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:27,777
WELL, HE WANTED TO REACH THE

369
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:29,112
TREES ON THE TOP.

370
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,980
WELL HOW COME OTHER ANIMALS

371
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,582
DIDN'T DEVELOP THE LONG NECK?

372
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:35,118
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REACH THE

373
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:37,053
TREES ON THE TOP.

374
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,888
HOW COME CERTAIN TYPE OF

375
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,423
EUROPEAN EELS HAVE TO SWIM

376
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:45,328
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN ORDER TO

377
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:46,029
MATE?

378
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,665
OTHERS ARE HAPPY FORNICATING

379
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:49,299
CLOSE TO HOME.

380
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,734
IT WORKED FOR ONE SEAL, NOT THE

381
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:52,068
OTHER.

382
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:53,369
WHY AREN'T WOMEN BORN WITH

383
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,004
TAILS LIKE CATS?

384
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,339
WELL, WOMEN DON'T SEEM TO NEED

385
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,808
THE TAILS, THOUGH IT COULD MAKE

386
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:01,211
THEM MORE ALLURING THAN THEY

387
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:01,478
ARE.

388
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:04,314
WHY DON'T CATS RULE THE WORLD,

389
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:05,115
CONSIDERING THEY HAVE EVERY

390
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,083
REASON AND EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO

391
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,852
DO SO?

392
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,453
WELL, THEY'RE CONTENT BEING OUR

393
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:11,654
DOMESTIC MASTERS.

394
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:14,791
THE ANECDOTES PILE ON

395
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,627
INTERMINABLY AND NO FUNDAMENTAL

396
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:18,895
LEADING PRINCIPLE.

397
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:23,066
MARK: DO YOU FIND THAT MOST

398
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,301
ATHEISTS, MORE PROMINENT

399
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,836
ATHEISTS EMBRACE DARWINISM.

400
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:27,670
>> EVERY LAST ONE.

401
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,105
MARK: WHY DO THEY DO THAT?

402
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,508
>> BECAUSE IT'S A SECULAR MYTH.

403
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:33,977
EVEN ATHEISTS NEED COMPELLING

404
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,879
MYTH HOW WE GOT HERE, WHAT WE

405
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,514
DO HERE, WHAT OUR PURPOSE IS.

406
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:41,518
HOW WE GOT HERE IS AN ACCIDENT.

407
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:44,187
WHAT WE GOT HERE?

408
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,088
WE HAVE NO IDEA.

409
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:47,323
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE,

410
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:51,728
FORNICATION AND REPLICATION,

411
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:52,428
THAT'S ABOUT IT, IT'S A VERY,

412
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:52,929
VERY VIABLE MYTH.

413
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,297
PEOPLE ACT ACCORDING TO IT.

414
00:13:54,297 --> 00:00:00,000
MARK: AND IT ALSO DOESN'T
