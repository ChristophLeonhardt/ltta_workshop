Costume designer Ruth E.
Carter has made her career
showcasing black history
and culture onscreen.
But with her latest
movie, “Black Panther,” she’s
looking to an African future.
In the film, the fictional
country of Wakanda
is derided as a third-world
backwater by outsiders,
but it’s actually a secretly
advanced, high-tech society.
Although it looks futuristic,
elements of African history
can be seen everywhere.
Carter got inspiration from the Turkana
and Maasai cultures
when designing the outfits
for the Dora Milaje,
a group of female warriors led
by Danai Gurira as Okoye.
Carter used this African mask as the
basis for a battle costume worn
by Winston Duke as M’Baku,
and her designs for
Lupita Nyong’o’s
character, Nakia,
are partially influenced
by the Surma populations of Ethiopia.
“The thing about Ruth 
is that she’s very understated.
She doesn’t lead with
all her experience.
She just leads with
a curiosity for the thing
she’s doing
right there and then.”
“Ruth would bring me in
and she would have,
like, a vision board
of, like, different inspirations.
And she would really fit—
She would really fit clothes
to myself,
And she would bring different
colors
and different flavors
to it.
And Shuri’s, like,
love and light,
and it was really, like, bright,
maybe all white, or maybe orange,
or anything that can really
bring out her personality.”
“She has everything you
want in a collaborator.
She’s experienced, but,
you know, she’s still
youthful and energetic,
still curious and open
to trying new things.
“Black Panther” broke
multiple box office records
the world over
during its opening weekend,
easily becoming the top-grossing
film of all time
by a black director
and featuring a
largely black cast.
And with that, Ruth Carter’s
costumes now also have
a place in the history books.
