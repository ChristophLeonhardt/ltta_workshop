really<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently what people usually do</font>

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,649
is that they arrive in their pools and

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,030

sizes one thing we have to say that I do

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,130
find marginally embarrassing is that

39
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,650
they list the shoe sizes and they ending
