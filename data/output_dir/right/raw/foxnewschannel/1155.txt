1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,148
YOU HAVE A LOT OF VERY

2
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:03,417
INTERESTING BACKGROUND ABOUT THE

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:05,419
FBI AND CIA, SO WE WILL SEE HOW

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,588
IT GOES.

5
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:10,424
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

6
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:12,593
HERE NOW WITH MORE,

7
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:13,727
TUCKER CARLSON, A HOST OF

8
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,229
TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.

9
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:17,898
HE GREW UP IN CALIFORNIA.

10
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:21,769
IT'S A LEADING INDICATOR.

11
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:22,202
BROWN.

12
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:25,172
>> IT'S A RACE OBSESSED PARTY,

13
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:26,406
IRONICALLY, AND IT DOES NOT

14
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:27,808
SURPRISE ME.

15
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:29,209
THE WHOLE BET IN CALIFORNIA IS

16
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:30,010
THAT CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS WHEN

17
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,011
IT FOR THEM.

18
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,213
AND THEY ARE RIGHT, TO SOME

19
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:33,547
EXTENT.

20
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:35,449
IMMIGRATION HAS TURNED IT FROM

21
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:36,617
ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLY

22
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:38,285
REPUBLICAN STATES TO THE MOST

23
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:38,919
RELIABLY DEMOCRATIC STATE.

24
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,621
AT THE QUESTION NOW IS ABOUT THE

25
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,489
ECONOMY, CAN YOU HAVE A STATE

26
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,558
THAT IS BASICALLY LATIN AMERICAN

27
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,226
IN ITS ECONOMIC STRUCTURE?

28
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:52,232
HUGE POOL OF POOR PEOPLE, NO

29
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:53,367
MIDDLE CLASS.

30
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:54,468
THEY ARE PUSHING POLICIES THAT

31
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:56,703
RESULT IN THAT AND HALF OF ALL

32
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:59,206
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ASKED THIS

33
00:00:59,206 --> 00:00:59,940
WEEK, THEY SAID THEY PREFERRED

34
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,809
TO LEAVE THE STATE AND A LOT OF

35
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:02,776
THEM ALREADY HAVE.

36
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:04,644
WHAT HAPPENS THEN WHEN THERE IS

37
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,780
NO SORT OF NORMAL

38
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,283
MIDDLE-CLASS -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE

39
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,784
MAKING $95,000 LEFT WITH KIDS.

40
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:11,552
THAT'S WHERE CALIFORNIA IS

41
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,120
GOING.

42
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,354
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

43
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,223
>> Martha: IT STRIKING TO ME,

44
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:17,991
JERRY BROWN HAS BEEN AROUND AS

45
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:19,526
LONG AS YOU AND I CAN REMEMBER.

46
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:22,563
I PULLED UP A PICTURE WITH HIM

47
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:23,497
AND LINDA RONSTADT.

48
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:26,366
I THOUGHT THAT GUY WAS SO COOL.

49
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:28,402
I THOUGHT, A TALKER WILL

50
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:29,670
APPRECIATE SEEING JERRY BROWN

51
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,406
AND BLENDS        LINDA RONSTAD.

52
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,208
BUT ALL THE YOUNGER PEOPLE, THEY

53
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,076
LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND SAY,

54
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,611
WHO IS THE OLD GUY?

55
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:39,012
WHILE HE'S THE GOVERNOR OF

56
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:39,613
CALIFORNIA.

57
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,748
BUT HE HAS MADE AN INDELIBLE

58
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:43,116
MARK ON THE STATE OVER ALL THESE

59
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:44,151
YEARS AND NOW IT'S THE FIRST

60
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,752
TIME IN 20 YEARS THAT THERE IS

61
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:47,821
AN OPEN GOVERNOR'S RACE IN

62
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:48,222
CALIFORNIA.

63
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:51,225
>> AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM.

64
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,660
THE FUNNY THING IS, AND THIS IS

65
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,562
NOT UNLIKE HOW MUCH THE STATE

66
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:58,799
HAS CHANGED.

67
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,835
HE PROBABLY PLANTED OPIUM

68
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,036
POPPIES ALONG INTERSTATE FIVE.

69
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:07,474
>> Martha: HE LIKES THAT

70
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:07,841
THROWBACK.

71
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,543
>> COMPARED TO WHAT IS ALWAYS A

72
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:10,176
QUESTION.

73
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:12,813
SO IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE WHERE

74
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,214
JERRY BROWN IS CONSIDERED

75
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,016
SENSIBLE, IT TELLS YOU, IT LOOKS

76
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:18,218
LIKE GAVIN NEWSOM, THE FORMER

77
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,553
MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO, IS GOING

78
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:20,787
TO GET IT.

79
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:26,393
ALSO PRETTY INTERESTING, THE

80
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,028
SAME SPECIES OF PROTECH LIBERAL

81
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:29,796
WILL BE RUNNING THE STATE.

82
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,798
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY, AND I

83
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,600
TALKED TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA A

84
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,036
LOT, WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

85
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:39,373
DEATH OF THE STATES MIDDLE-CLASS

86
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:40,374
DEATH OF THE STATES MIDDLE-CLAS

87
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:40,807
MIDDLE-CLASS.

88
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:41,875
BUT THIS ECONOMIC MODEL DOESN'T

89
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,409
WORK.

90
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,778
EVEN IN THE END, IT COLLAPSES.

91
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:45,412
YOU NEED A MIDDLE-CLASS TO

92
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:49,983
SUSTAIN THE ECONOMY, AND THEY

93
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:50,617
ARE LOSING THEIRS.

94
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:51,385
>> Martha: A COUPLE THINGS I

95
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:53,053
WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT, YOU ARE

96
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,988
DOING A SERIES WHICH I THOUGHT

97
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:55,989
WAS VERY INTERESTING.

98
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,591
IT'S BASICALLY A DEVICE TO

99
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,892
DEPROGRAM AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

100
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:00,394
IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH IS

101
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:01,228
POTENTIALLY MAKING US LESS SAFE

102
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:04,231
EVERY TIME WE GET ON AN

103
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:04,598
AIRPLANE.

104
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:05,399
>> IT'S TERRIFYING.

105
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,867
I'M INTERESTED IN THE STANDARDS

106
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,236
IN THEIR DECLINE FOR A NUMBER OF

107
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:12,072
DIFFERENT REASONS, WHERE THE

108
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:12,673
IDEOLOGY OF DIVERSITY.

109
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,608
BUT UNDER THE OBAMA

110
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:15,876
ADMINISTRATION, THE FAA CHANGE

111
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,411
THE STANDARDS FOR BECOMING AN

112
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,379
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER AND

113
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,013
INSTITUTED A SCREENING

114
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,348
BIOGRAPHICAL TAPPED ON MY

115
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,817
CONTEST THAT AWARDED POINTS ON

116
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,585
HOW LITTLE YOU KNEW.

117
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:26,620
SO IF YOU ARE UNEMPLOYED FOR THE

118
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,454
LAST THREE YEARS, YOU GOT MORE

119
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:30,424
POINTS THAN IF YOU HAD A JOB.

120
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:31,224
IF YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT

121
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:32,893
SCIENCE YOU GOT MORE POINTS THAN

122
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,828
IF YOU ARE A LICENSED PILOT.

123
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:38,231
THIS IS FOR AN AIR TRAFFIC

124
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:39,032
CONTROL JOB.

125
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:40,634
THEY SOUGHT THE LEAST QUALIFIED

126
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,070
AND WE PROVE THAT.

127
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,339
WE HAVE THE DOCUMENTS.

128
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:55,482
NO REPORTER ALEX VIPER GOT THEM.

129
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:56,183
I CALLED OVER MYSELF AND SAID,

130
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:56,750
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

131
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,384
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT SAFER?

132
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:58,118
THEY COULDN'T ANSWER IT BECAUSE

133
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:58,785
THEY DON'T CARE, THAT'S THE

134
00:03:58,785 --> 00:03:59,186
POINT.

135
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:01,188
>> Martha: IT'S REALLY HARD TO

136
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:02,856
IMAGINE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE

137
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:05,392
MAPS THAT SHOW HOW MANY PLANES

138
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:07,227
ARE FLYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

139
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:11,932
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A MORE

140
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:15,769
IMPORTANT JOB THAN SAFETY IN

141
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,070
THIS COUNTRY.

142
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,272
>> Tucker: TO AWARD POINTS FOR

143
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:24,211
SOMEONE WHO IS -- THE

144
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:25,479
MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS, IT'S

145
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,214
AN OPPRESSIVE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE

146
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:28,281
CAN TRUST OUR AIR TRAFFIC

147
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:28,782
CONTROL.

148
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:31,985
WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND WE

149
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:32,352
SHOULDN'T.

150
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,820
>> Martha: THE ONLY THING THAT

151
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,088
SHOULD BE IMPORTANT IS, WHO'S

152
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:35,789
THE BEST.

153
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,792
WHO'S THE BEST AT THAT JOB.

154
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,194
>> Tucker: WHILE YOU MIGHT BE

155
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:43,764
LIKE, WHO CARES, IT'S ON

156
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:44,131
PROFESSOR.

157
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:45,799
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL.

158
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,200
>> Martha: IS ON TONIGHT?

159
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,201
WHEN I'M DONE WITH MY SHOW AND I

160
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,971
CAN KICK BACK, I THINK, TUCKER

161
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,974
IS ON!

162
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:56,410
>> Tucker: IT'S A MUCH MORE

163
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,611
INTERESTING PERSON THEN YOU

164
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,946
MIGHT THINK, AND KNOWS A LOT OF

165
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,882
DIFFERENT PEOPLE YOU WOULDN'T

166
00:05:01,882 --> 00:00:00,000
EXPECT HER TO NO.
