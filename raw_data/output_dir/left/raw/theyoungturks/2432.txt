1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,020
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
COMPONENTS OF ANY FUNCTIONING

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:09,860
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR SYSTEM IS
TO SUPPORT AND APPLAUD POLITICAL

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,420
ACTIVISM, POLITICAL RHETORIC.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,750
IT
IS IMPORTANT TO DO THAT.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,750
BUT

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,160
LAURA INGRAHAM DOESN'T SEEM TO
SUPPORT IT.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,690
IN FACT RECENTLY SHE

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,610
DID SOME COMMENTARY IN REGARD TO
LEBRON JAMES'S STATEMENT ABOUT

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,110
DONALD TRUMP.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,330
ESPN DID A SPECIAL
SEGMENT WHERE CERTAIN NBA

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,820
PLAYERS WERE INTERVIEWED ABOUT
POLITICAL ISSUES, AND HERE IS

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,410
WHAT LEBRON JAMES HAD TO SAY AND
HOW MUCH LAURA INGRAHAM HATED

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,410
IT.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,410
TAKE A LOOK.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,079
>>THIS IS A DUMB JOCK ALERT.

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,510
NBA
SUPERSTAR LEBRON JAMES IS

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,620
TALKING ABOUT POLITICS AND ITS
R-RATED, HERE IS HIS BARELY

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,840
INTELLIGIBLE TAKE ON PRESIDENT
TRUMP IN A NEW ESPN PODCAST.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,420
>>THE NUMBER ONE JOB IN
AMERICA, THE POINT OF PERSON, IS

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,759
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE PEOPLE AND REALLY DON'T GIVE

21
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,159
A [BLEEP] ABOUT THE PEOPLE.

22
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,249
>>THERE IS MORE GRIPPING
INSIGHT, ESPN ASKED JAMES AND

23
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:20,909
KEVIN DURANT ABOUT TRUMP'S
RACIST COMMENTS.

24
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,409
WEISS OUR

25
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,119
COUNTRY IS NOT RAN BY A GREAT
COACH.

26
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,119
>>

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,919
IT'S NOT EVEN A SURPRISE WHEN HE
SAYS SOMETHING, IT'S LAUGHABLE.

28
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:36,549
>>IT'S LAUGHABLE BUT ALSO SCARY,
I SHOULDN'T BE NUMB TO YOUR

29
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:39,899
RACIST COMMENTS AND BEHAVIOR.

30
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:46,169
>>THEY ADDRESS TRUMP'S RHETORIC
AND HOW IT HAS LED TO SOME

31
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,460
RACISTS BASICALLY FEELING
COMFORTABLE AND EMBOLDENED

32
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,299
ENOUGH TO COME OUT AND SHARE
THEIR PERSPECTIVES IN CERTAIN

33
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,079
COMMUNITIES, AND I THOUGHT IT
WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT

34
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,669
PERSPECTIVE, ESPECIALLY AS
SOMEONE, LEBRON JAMES, SOMEONE

35
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,419
WHO EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF RACISM HIMSELF

36
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:05,619
PERSONALLY VERY RECENTLY.

37
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,619
SOMEONE SPRAY-PAINTED THAT "N"

38
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,590
WORD ON HIS HOME IN LOS ANGELES,
WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,209
LIBERAL PART OF THE COUNTRY.

40
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,989
HE
MADE AN INTERESTING STATEMENT AT

41
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,489
THE TIME ABOUT HOW EVEN AS A
SUCCESSFUL BLACK MAN WHO IS

42
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,920
WEALTHY AND LIVING IN AN
AFFLUENT PART OF THE COUNTRY,

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,069
YOU STILL GET CONFRONTED BY THAT
TYPE OF RACIAL TENSION, BY THAT

44
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,500
TYPE OF RACISM.

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,879
THAT IS A
PERSPECTIVE THAT SHOULD BE

46
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,879
HEARD.

47
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,650
AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A
PLATFORM LIKE LEBRON JAMES DOES,

48
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,250
I FEEL LIKE HE HAS ALMOST SOME
SORT OF A RESPONSIBILITY TO

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,239
PROVIDE A VOICE FOR THE
VOICELESS, AND I APPLAUD

50
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,659
HIM FOR DOING WHAT HE DID.

51
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,689
>>THIS IS A TYPICAL CONSERVATIVE
THING OF, DUMB JOCK,

52
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,849
ENTERTAINER, JUST DO YOUR JOB.

53
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,409
SHUT UP, ALREADY.

54
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,409
TO BE FAIR TO

55
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,609
THE REPUBLICANS, IF YOU ARE AN
ENTERTAINER DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR

56
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:01,609
FROM YOU.

57
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:03,189
LIKE IF YOU ARE AN
ACTOR LIKE RONALD REAGAN THEY

58
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,650
HAVE NO INTEREST.

59
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,290
OR TED NUGENT,
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DUMB

60
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,569
ENTERTAINERS, THE GUY WHO
CRAPPED HIS PANTS TO GET OUT OF

61
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,030
VIETNAM.

62
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,219
OR FOR EXAMPLE A
REALITY SHOW HOST.

63
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,219
AND IF YOU

64
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,310
ARE A VERY STABLE GENIUS/ONE OF
THE DUMBEST GUYS ALIVE WHO SAYS

65
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,200
THINGS LIKE I HAVE THE BEST
WORDS, ONE OF THE TWO GREAT

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,989
ATTRIBUTES I'VE HAD THROUGHOUT
MY LIFE IS THAT I'M MENTALLY

67
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,420
STABLE -- WHO SAYS THAT?

68
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,209
BUT I
DON'T MEMBER LAURA INGRAHAM

69
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,310
TELLING THAT DUMB ENTERTAINER TO
SHUT UP.

70
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,769
SHE SUPPORTED HIM

71
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,010
NONSTOP.

72
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,099
ALL OF A SUDDEN THOUGH
WHEN YOU DON'T AGREE, DUMB JOCK.

73
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,430
WHATEVER.

74
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,830
AND GET A LOAD OF THE
HYPOCRISY.

75
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,849
YOU SAW THE CHYRON

76
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:53,420
THEY HAD, THE GRAPHIC, R-RATED
COMMENTS BY LEBRON, HE'S GETTING

77
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,540
PROFANE -- DO YOU KNOW THAT
BOBBY KNIGHT, ALSO IN

78
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,849
BASKETBALL, BUT A WHITE COACH,
WHEN HE SUPPORTED TRUMP AND USED

79
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,469
CURSE WORDS AND WAS PROFANE IN
SUPPORTING TRUMP, THE SAME LAURA

80
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:10,920
INGRAHAM SAID THAT WAS GREAT, HE
REJECTED POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,499
>>THAT'S RIGHT.

82
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:18,418
AND SHE IS VERY
SUPPORTIVE OF A PRESIDENT WHO

83
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,018
HAD SAID THAT HE GRABS WOMEN BY
THE PUSSY.

84
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,460
I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S

85
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,630
A LITTLE R-RATED FOR MY TASTE.

86
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,470
>>THAT WAS JUST LOCKER ROOM
TALK.

87
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,560
BUT LEBRON JAMES AND KEVIN

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,770
DURANT CAN'T DO LOCKER ROOM TALK
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN AN

89
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,889
ACTUAL LOCKER ROOM.

90
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,950
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE SHE HAS TWO
DIFFERENT STANDARDS.

91
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,470
>>LET'S HEAR MORE ABOUT HER
PERSPECTIVE ON THE COMMENTS

92
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,039
COMING FROM THE PLAYERS.

93
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,740
>>MUST THEY RUN THEIR MOUTHS
LIKE THAT?

94
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,910
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT

95
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,610
OF KIDS AND SOME ADULTS TAKE
THESE IGNORANT COMMENTS

96
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,610
SERIOUSLY.

97
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,090
LOOK, THERE MIGHT BE
A CAUTIONARY LESSON IN LEBRON

98
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,210
FOR KIDS.

99
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,449
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO LEAVE HIGH

100
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,630
SCHOOL A YEAR EARLY TO JOIN THE
NBA. AND IT'S ALWAYS UNWISE TO

101
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,099
SEEK POLITICAL ADVICE FROM
SOMEONE WHO GETS PAID $100

102
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:13,520
MILLION A YEAR TO BOUNCE A BALL.

103
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,410
OH, AND LEBRON AND KEVIN, YOU'RE

104
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,810
GREAT PLAYERS BUT NO ONE VOTED
FOR YOU.

105
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,460
MILLIONS ELECTED TRUMP

106
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,680
TO BE THE COACH.

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,490
SO KEEP THE
POLITICAL COMMENTARY TO

108
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,780
YOURSELF.

109
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,620
OR AS SOMEONE ONCE
SAID, SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE.

110
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,020
>>YOU KNOW, 3 MILLION MORE
ACTUALLY VOTED FOR TRUMP'S

111
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,560
OPPONENT, BUT THAT'S NOT
CONVENIENT INFORMATION FOR YOUR

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
COMMENTARY SEGMENT.

113
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,590
BY THE WAY,
DWYANE WADE, WHO IS GOOD FRIENDS

114
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,930
WITH HER LEBRON JAMES, WANTED TO
SHARE HIS THOUGHTS ON THIS, AND

115
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,550
HE SAID THEY USED TO TRY TO HIDE
IT, MEANING RACISM, NOW THE

116
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,639
PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN EVERYONE THE
COURAGE TO LIVE THEIR TRUTHS.

117
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,030
>>MY TAKE ON THIS -- I KNOW
LAURA INGRAHAM, AND HERE'S THE

118
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,710
THING, ONE THING I WILL GIVE THE
FOX NEWS CHANNEL, BECAUSE I WORK

119
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,980
THERE, NO ONE IS EDITORIALIZED,
WE CAN SAY WHAT WE WANT TO SAY,

120
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,660
WE ARE NEVER BROUGHT INTO THE
EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE BECAUSE WE

121
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,400
SAID WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE.

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,970
THAT'S
THE BENEFIT OF WORKING THERE.

123
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,910
LAURA IS ENTITLED TO HER
OPINIONS, I DISAGREE WITH THEM

124
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,770
VEHEMENTLY, BUT ALSO LEBRON
JAMES AND KEVIN DURANT AND

125
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,729
DWYANE WADE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO
THEIRS.

126
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,129
AND TO SAY THAT THEIR

127
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,319
LANGUAGES R-RATED, AND I SAID
THIS, OUR KIDS ARE WATCHING, AND

128
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:36,919
WHEN OUR PRESIDENT CAN GET UP IN
FRONT OF A RALLY AND CALL COLIN

129
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,069
KAEPERNICK AN S.O.B.

130
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,280
OR HE CAN
SAY GET OUT, YOU ARE FAKE NEWS,

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,979
ROUGH HIM UP, PUNCH HIM IN THE
FACE, THIS IS NOT OKAY.

132
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:48,979
KEVIN

133
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,409
DURANT AND LEBRON JAMES AREN'T
THE PRESIDENT, SHE'S RIGHT ON

134
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,720
THAT POINT, BUT TO SOME EXTENT
THE PRESIDENT HAS NO MORALS AT

135
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,550
ALL, HE'S NOT A ROLE MODEL.

136
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,789
I
DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS BUT IF I DID

137
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,810
I WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO MODEL
THEMSELVES AFTER THE PRESIDENT.

138
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,650
THERE ARE REPUBLICANS I LIKE, I
WOULDN'T MIND MY KIDS LOOKING UP

139
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:16,960
TO GEORGE W. BUSH OR RONALD
REAGAN, I DON'T LIKE THEIR

140
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,750
POLICIES BUT THEY CONDUCTED
THEMSELVES AS HONORABLE MEN.

141
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:28,069
THIS GUY BROUGHT THE WHITE HOUSE
DOWN TO THE MORAL STANDARDS OF A

142
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,169
GUTTER.

143
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:34,789
IT'S GUTTER, REALITY
SHOW, VH1-LEVEL REALITY SHOW AT

144
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,260
THE WHITE HOUSE.

145
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,580
>>EVERYTHING SHE IS ACCUSING
LEBRON JAMES OF BEING IS WHAT

146
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,919
SHE LOVES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

147
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,060
SHE CRITICIZES LEBRON JAMES FOR

148
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,510
HIS PROFANITY AND HIS GRAMMAR --
DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP IS A

149
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,469
GREAT PUBLIC SPEAKER?

150
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,849
DO YOU
THINK HIS GRAMMAR IS TOP-NOTCH?

151
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,719
DOES HE SOUND LIKE AN EDUCATED
PERSON?

152
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,719
I KNOW HE WENT TO --

153
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:02,470
>>SOME OF THE BEST SCHOOLS.

154
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,000
>>NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN AS
EDUCATED AS TRUMP, THAT'S WHAT

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
HE WOULD SAY.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,069
BUT HE WOULDN'T
SAY IT CORRECTLY.

157
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,069
HE DOESN'T

158
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,699
KNOW HOW TO SPEAK, HE CAN'T PUT
TWO WORDS TOGETHER, AND SHE HAS

159
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,689
THE AUDACITY TO GO AFTER OTHERS
ABOUT THEIR GRAMMAR?

160
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:22,490
>>I DON'T WANT MY KIDS MODELED
AFTER ANY OF THOSE GUYS TO BE

161
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,259
HONEST.

162
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,870
GEORGE W. BUSH STARTED A
WAR, MILLIONS DIED, HE'S A

163
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,870
TERRIBLE GUY.

164
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,889
YES HE DOESN'T
CURSE AND HE DOESN'T DO THE

165
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,949
VULGAR THINGS TRUMP DOES.

166
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,980
REAGAN
DID TERRIBLE THINGS, THEIR

167
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,780
ACTIONS ARE VULGAR, BUT I
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

168
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,200
AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT CURSING,
LYNDON JOHNSON CURSED ALL THE

169
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,980
TIME, I DON'T CARE.

170
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,340
SO WHY ARE
ATHLETES THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT

171
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,660
ALLOWED TO GIVE THEIR OPINIONS?

172
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,370
WHEN JOE THE PLUMBER CAME OUT IN

173
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,790
2008 AND HATED OBAMA THEY WERE
LIKE YES, A PLUMBER!

174
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,820
SO WHY ARE

175
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,920
ATHLETES THE ONLY AMERICANS NOT
ALLOWED TO GIVE OPINIONS?

176
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
IF YOU

177
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,211
DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF IT,
AND IF YOU ARE BEING KIND TO

178
00:08:56,211 --> 00:09:00,270
LAURA INGRAHAM SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THE HISTORY, BUT I THINK SHE

179
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,750
DOES -- WHEN YOU TELL
AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO STOP

180
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,290
RUNNING THEIR MOUTHS, SHUT UP
AND DO THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

181
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,560
THAT WE TOLD YOU TO DO, THAT HAS
A DEEP HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY.

182
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,840
SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW
IT, LOOK INTO IT.

183
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,060
THERE ARE A LOT OF BOOKS ABOUT
IT.

184
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,930
>>IT'S BLACK HISTORY MONTH.

185
00:09:19,930 --> 00:00:00,000
>>IT IS NOT THING THE
CONNOTATIONS ARE CLEAR
