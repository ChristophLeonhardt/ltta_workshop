1
00:00:00,573 --> 00:00:01,207
AREA.

2
00:00:01,207 --> 00:00:02,375
HE HAS PROVED TOTALLY UNWILLING

3
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:04,644
TO EVEN GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT.

4
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:08,815
THANK HEAVENS.

5
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:10,316
ON TWITTER YOU MAY READ FORMER

6
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:13,420
CIA HAD JOHN BRENNAN SPOUTING

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,121
OFF ABOUT THE POLITICAL NEWS OF

8
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:16,990
THE DAY, ATTACKING THE

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,391
PRESIDENT'S DISHONESTY HE SAYS.

10
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,293
IT TURNS OUT BRENNAN HIMSELF IS

11
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:20,627
A LIAR.

12
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:22,562
HE'S BEEN CAUGHT LYING, ODD FOR

13
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:23,997
A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL.

14
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:26,366
LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE BRENNAN

15
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,601
TOLD CONGRESS THE INFAMOUS

16
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:29,402
STEELE DOSSIER HAD NO INFLUENCE

17
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:31,204
AT ALL ON THE CLAIM THAT RUSSIA

18
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,807
INTERFERED IN THE 2016 ELECTION.

19
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,575
HERE'S A SELECTION.

20
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:36,342
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO COMMISSIONED

21
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:38,778
THE STEELE DOSSIER?

22
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:39,646
>> I DON'T.

23
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:43,583
>> DID THE CIA RELY ON IT?

24
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,184
>> NO.

25
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:44,651
>> MIGHT NOT?

26
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:47,053
>> BECAUSE IT WASN'T PART OF THE

27
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,322
CORPUS OF INTELLIGENCE

28
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:51,691
INFORMATION THAT WE HAD.

29
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:52,992
IT WAS NOT IN ANY WAY USED AS A

30
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,896
BASIS FOR THE INTEL COMMUNITY

31
00:00:56,896 --> 00:01:00,166
ASSESSMENT THAT WAS DONE.

32
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,401
>> Tucker: BUSTED!

33
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:01,701
LIAR!

34
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,236
BY THE WAY, BRENNAN, YOU SHOULD

35
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:07,574
KNOW THIS, IS IN NBC AND MSNBC

36
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:10,410
CONTRIBUTOR, NEEDLESS TO SAY.

37
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,378
TO TOP FORMER INTEL OFFICIALS

38
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:14,180
DISPUTE HIS CLAIM.

39
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,115
IF YOU JUST HEARD THAT THE

40
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:17,984
DOSSIER FORMED NO PART OF THE

41
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:19,352
CORPUS OF INTELLIGENCE USED BY

42
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:20,753
OUR GOVERNMENT TO SPY ON THE

43
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:22,522
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

44
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:23,323
HE RETIRED NATIONAL SECURITY

45
00:01:23,323 --> 00:01:25,091
AGENCY MICHAEL ROGERS AND FORMER

46
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,593
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

47
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:28,194
INTELLIGENCE JIM CLAPPER BOTH

48
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:29,596
ADMIT NOW THAT THE STEELE

49
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:32,198
DOSSIER AND ITS CLINTON

50
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:33,066
CAMPAIGN-FUNDED ALLEGATIONS DID

51
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,401
IN FACT INFLUENCED THE COMMUNITY

52
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:35,802
ASSESSMENT.

53
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:37,804
WE KNEW THAT, BUT IT'S NICE TO

54
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:38,438
HEAR IT CONFIRMED.

55
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:40,173
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY IS SENIOR

56
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:41,508
EDITOR OF THE FEDERALIST AND SHE

57
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:42,041
JOINS US TONIGHT.

58
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,776
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING

59
00:01:43,776 --> 00:01:44,577
THIS CAREFULLY.

60
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:45,612
A LOT OF THESE STORIES SEEM TO

61
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:48,014
LEAD BACK TO THIS GUY, JOHN

62
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:48,781
BRENNAN.

63
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:50,383
YOU WOULD THINK IS THE FORMER

64
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,584
HEAD OF THE CIA HE IS SOMEONE

65
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:53,586
YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TRUST, BUT

66
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:56,189
HE SEEMS NOT ONLY A LIAR, BUT AN

67
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:56,589
INAPT ONE.

68
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:57,790
AM I MISREADING THIS?

69
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,792
>> WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

70
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:00,827
MULTIPLE HEADS OF INTELLIGENCE

71
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:02,262
AGENCIES AND THAT DOES INCLUDE

72
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:03,496
BRENNAN, WHO HAS A HISTORY OF

73
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,999
LYING, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SPYING

74
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,168
ON AMERICAN CITIZENS.

75
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,604
HIM SERIOUSLY BUT WE'VE ALSO HAD

76
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:12,505
PROBLEMS WITH FALSEHOODS BEING

77
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:16,276
SET ALSO BY JAMES CLAPPER, WHO

78
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:16,943
GAVE INCONSISTENT TESTIMONY

79
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:18,278
ABOUT HIS LEAKING TO THE MEDIA

80
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,780
AND WE'VE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH

81
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,614
JAMES COMEY HIMSELF, WHETHER HE

82
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:23,616
UNDERSTANDS WHAT A LEAK IS AND

83
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,084
HOW HE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN IT.

84
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:27,086
BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT'S

85
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:28,988
INTERESTING IS THEY HAVE BEEN SO

86
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:30,256
MUCH A PART OF THIS STORY AND WE

87
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:32,091
HAVE SEEN THEIR NAMES A GREAT

88
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,793
DEAL, BUT BRENNAN HAS BEEN ABLE

89
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:35,595
TO KIND OF STAY OUT OF THE

90
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:36,296
LIMELIGHT UNTIL RECENTLY WHERE

91
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:37,463
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO PIECE

92
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,799
TOGETHER JUST HOW INTEGRAL HE

93
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:42,402
WAS TO THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN

94
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:42,802
NARRATIVE.

95
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:45,805
SO FOR INSTANCE --

96
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:48,207
>> Tucker: PLEASE GO AHEAD.

97
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:49,175
>> HE ACTUALLY LAUNCHED THE

98
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:49,609
INVESTIGATION.

99
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:51,411
HE HAS BRAGGED ABOUT HOW HE WAS

100
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,245
INVOLVED IN LAUNCHING AN

101
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:52,812
INVESTIGATION.

102
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,447
HE ALSO WAS REALLY KEY IN

103
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:55,615
BRIEFING HARRY REID, WHICH

104
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:56,583
HARRY REID HAS SAID HE

105
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,350
UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS BEING

106
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,586
BRIEFED BY BRENNAN SPECIFICALLY

107
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:00,620
SO HE WOULD LICK THAT

108
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,255
INFORMATION AND GET IT OUT TO

109
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,190
THE MEDIA AND ALSO PRESSURE

110
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,391
JAMES COMEY AND THESE OTHER

111
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,125
THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING BUT

112
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,594
ARE COMING OUT NOW ABOUT HOW HE

113
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:09,195
CLAIMS THAT THE DOSSIER WASN'T

114
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,063
USED, WHICH MADE NO SENSE

115
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:11,998
ALREADY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE

116
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:13,933
DOSSIER WAS USED TO SECURE A

117
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,835
WIRETAP AGAINST SOMEONE IN THE

118
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:16,669
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AND IT

119
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,971
STANDS TO REASON THAT IT WOULD

120
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:18,605
HAVE BEEN INCLUDED.

121
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:20,807
BUT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE

122
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,709
WHO DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

123
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:23,710
INTEGRITY, PARTICULARLY MIKE

124
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,645
ROGERS SAYING THAT OF COURSE IT

125
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:28,014
WAS USED IN THE INTELLIGENCE

126
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:28,715
COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT.

127
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:30,283
>> Tucker: IT'S BECOMING CLEAR

128
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:31,851
THAT A LOT OF THE SECRECY

129
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,252
SURROUNDING THESE ACTIVITIES IS

130
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,220
DESIGNED NOT TO PROTECT THE

131
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,622
UNITED STATES FROM FOREIGN

132
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:36,990
THREATS, BUT TO PROTECT THE

133
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,757
MISDEEDS OF THE PEOPLE GATHERING

134
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:40,793
THE INTELLIGENCE.

135
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,196
>> IT DOES SEEM THAT THAT HAS

136
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:44,998
BECOME A BIG PART OF THE

137
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:45,365
OPERATION.

138
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,432
WHETHER PEOPLE GOT IN OVER THEIR

139
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:47,967
HEADS, WHETHER THEY WERE LED

140
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:49,602
ASTRAY BY BRENNAN AND THEY DID

141
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:50,370
THINGS THAT MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T

142
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,471
HAVE DONE, IT DOES SEEM THAT A

143
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,206
LOT OF WHAT WE SEEN IN THE LAST

144
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,407
FEW MONTHS IS ABOUT ATTEMPTING

145
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:55,975
TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM FINDING OUT

146
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,044
THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT WAS

147
00:03:58,044 --> 00:03:58,411
HAPPENING.

148
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,213
TODAY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" DID

149
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:01,914
REPORT BASED ON JUST A

150
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:02,615
WIDESPREAD LEAKING FROM PEOPLE

151
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:03,916
WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE

152
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,184
INVESTIGATION THAT, YES, PEOPLE

153
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:05,918
ARE NOW ADMITTING THEY WERE

154
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:08,054
SPYING ON TRIM CAMPAIGN IN A

155
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:09,389
FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FASHION.

156
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,491
IT WASN'T JUST CARTER PAGE, IT

157
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:13,326
WAS FOUR TOP OFFICIALS.

158
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,794
THEY WEREN'T JUST USING FISA

159
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:16,596
WIRETAPS, THEY WERE ALSO USING

160
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,096
NATIONAL SECURITY LETTERS AND

161
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:18,630
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.

162
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,767
AT LEAST ONE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE

163
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:22,268
SOURCE.

164
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:23,469
THIS IS GOING TO BUST WIDE OPEN

165
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,038
AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL DEMAND A

166
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:26,606
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT JUST WHAT

167
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:28,207
THE FBI AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE

168
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,208
AGENCIES WERE THINKING WHEN THEY

169
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,343
BEGAN SPYING ON THE POLITICAL

170
00:04:30,343 --> 00:00:00,000
CAMPAIGN OF A MAJOR PARTY.
