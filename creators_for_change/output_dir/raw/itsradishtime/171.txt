oh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to so many people are going</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,750
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> college this week and if you are</font>

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,810
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them I envy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you for reasons that</font>

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,880
I've explained in this video right here

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,889
side note though i bought these

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,160
sunglasses today at gap and as i<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,450
checking out and making small talk with

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the scales woman i brought up somehow</font>

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,949
that I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work for old navy which</font>

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,630
is owned by the same companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> gap and</font>

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,279
she was like oh have you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of</font>

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,109
working for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company again because</font>

13
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,939
I'm always looking for good people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

14
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,210
was like extra know so i guess side

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,340
benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of college is that</font>

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,469
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work in retail anymore but today</font>

17
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,030
I actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the best</font>

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,820
job that I ever had<font color="#CCCCCC"> in college which was</font>

19
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,500
working in the Writing Center being a

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,870
writing intensive English major I got to

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a class which actually trained me</font>

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to do this job so every time I work</font>

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,300
to shift I would meet with writers for

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,370
either half hour or<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hour increments</font>

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just talk about their writing it</font>

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,410
wasn't a correction or critique it was a

27
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,710
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I would have the writer</font>

28
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,530
read their paper out loud to me and I

29
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,449
would sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take notes not actually</font>

30
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:04,830
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it the cool thing about</font>

31
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,049
reading your papers out loud is that you

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,360
catch so many of your grammar mistakes

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,610
and awkward word choices yourself as you

34
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,200
read it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the reading was all</font>

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,540
over we would talk together about some

36
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,030
of the big picture concepts so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,040
your papers structure and transitions

38
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,110
and are you explaining your evidence

39
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,390
well do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> even have it in and are you</font>

40
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,490
writing in writer based or reader based

41
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,619
prose writer based prose<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my</font>

42
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,840
favorite concepts ever basically when

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,610
you're writing you've been in class and

44
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,829
you've been researching for so long<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

45
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,090
you've got all these ideas formed in

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,259
your head and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're writing your</font>

47
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,759
paper you're laying out all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> points</font>

48
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,890
so you got point<font color="#CCCCCC"> A</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here point I</font>

49
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,020
over there and quite see over here and

50
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,399
just because you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> studying this</font>

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,680
thing for so long point b and point<font color="#E5E5E5"> d</font>

52
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,780
are super obvious to you so why would

53
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to</font>

54
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wayne them in your paper but I as an</font>

55
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,870
objective reader don't know all that

56
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff so I need you to spell it out for</font>

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,040
me and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that's reader base</font>

58
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,930
pros that's like when people talk about

59
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,140
that mysterious concept of flow and

60
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,080
writing like just my paper flow well a

61
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,389
big chunk of that is using reader based

62
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,130
writing is your writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> center tip of</font>

63
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,720
the day but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the best part of my</font>

64
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,910
job is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I got to learn so much stuff</font>

65
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,860
because I was working with all kinds of

66
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,540
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah a lot of the people are</font>

67
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,520
consulted with four freshmen in their

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,710
first-year composition classes but I

69
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,240
also met with a lot of international

70
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,100
students who are writing this really

71
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,680
dense academic material in a second

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,100
language like I for whatever reason saw

73
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,550
a ton of nursing dissertations oh and

74
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,990
personal statements for grad school

75
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,750
which were my absolute favorite and then

76
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,160
a bunch of my fellow English majors

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,170
often my co-workers at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the writing sign</font>

78
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,600
here in college right now is a total

79
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,790
myth that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> only go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Writing</font>

80
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,860
Center if you're a bad writer first of

81
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,770
all no such thing and second of all

82
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,820
everybody benefits from this I would

83
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,410
take my own stuff there because it's

84
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,910
always helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

85
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,100
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas like in college instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

86
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,230
writing essays or even worse taking

87
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,450
essay tests I always wish that I could

88
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,220
just sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the professor and</font>

89
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,470
talk about what I learned so instead I

90
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">just went and talked it out with a tutor</font>

91
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,830
until my ideas got clarified enough that

92
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,780
they were like that yes what you just

93
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,540
said now just write<font color="#CCCCCC"> that down I so you</font>

94
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,280
complete and when I didn't have somebody

95
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">in for an appointment I just got to hang</font>
