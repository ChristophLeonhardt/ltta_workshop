Neil: WHO KNEW THE STORM OVER STORMY AS IN STORMY DANIELS AND THE PAYMENT TO HER, TURNS OUT THE PRESIDENT DID REMEMBER THIS MATTER AFTER LONG INSISTING HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS MATTER. I HAD HEARD THIS BEFORE A LOT AND ADDRESSED IT LAST NIGHT. LET ME BE CLEAR, MR. PRESIDENT, HOW CAN YOU DRAIN THE SWAMP IN YOU'RE THE ONE THAT KEEPS MUDDYING THE WATER. YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT $130,000 PAYMENT TO A PORN STAR UNTIL YOU DID. SAID YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HOW YOUR FORMER LAWYER MICHAEL COHEN HANDLED THIS UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGE HANDLED THIS UNTIL ACKNOWLEDIN HANDLED THIS UNTIL ACKNOWLEDING TODAY YOU WERE BEHIND THE RETAINER PAYMENT THAT TOOK CARE OF THIS. I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE A LIAR. I'M HAVING A DEVIL OF A TIME FIGURING OUT WHICH NEWS IS FAKE. YOUR OWN WORDS GIVE ME LOTS OF PAUSE. I GUESS YOU'RE TOO BUSY DRAINING THE SWAMP TO EVER STOP AND SMELL THE STINK YOU'RE CREATING. THAT'S YOUR STINK. MR. PRESIDENT, THAT'S YOUR SWAMP. PRETTY CLEAR, BUT A LOT OF YOU CLEARLY TICKED OFF. FRANK ON FACEBOOK WRITES "NEIL, YOU PROVED TODAY THAT YOU'RE A LEFTIST LIBERAL AND A MORON. I WILL NO LONGER LISTEN TO YOUR SHOW. CIAO." BOBBY WRITES "YOU JUST LOST MILLIONS OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS TODAY WITH YOUR RANT ON YOUR PRESIDENT. ENJOY YOUR LOW RATINGS." GLENDA ON FACEBOOK "WE ALL KNOW TRUMP ISN'T PERFECT, BUT MANWAY TO PILE ON. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO BACK AND EXAMINE EVERY WORD OUT OF YOUR MOUTH." WHICH IT IS? JOEY RIGHTS, "CAVUTO, SHUT THE HELL UP. YOU'RE AN IDIOT" AM NOT. "REALLY CAVUTO, YOU SUCK." LINDA LIND LINDA WRITES "I WAS ASTOUNDED, CAVUTO HAS BECOME A TRUE JERK. TODAY IS THE LAST TIME I WILL USE MY ELECTRICITY TO WATCH YOUR FAT FACE." LIKE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE. LINDA WRITES "TOTALLY AGREE. MANY CANNOT SEE PAST THEIR BLIND DEVOTION." TIM ON FACEBOOK WRITES "YOUR COMMENTARY TODAY NAILED IT AND I'M A REPUBLICAN." SCOTT WRITES "BOYCOTT FOX NEWS UNTIL NEIL CAVUTO IS TERMINATED." JULIE, "SHUT UP, NEIL." NO, YOU SHUT UP. GREG, "CAVUTO IS LIKE THE RHINO ESTABLISHMENT. ALWAYS HAS BEEN." HOW DARE YOU CALL ME FAT, KAREN. ANYWAY, DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE CAMERA ADDS 20 POUNDS? ASK ANY RHINO. IF A RHINO COULD TALK. BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT LIKE THE ANIMAL. IT'S RINO. FAT CHANCE YOU KNEW THAT ONE. SEE HOW I BLENDED THAT. VANESSA "I FELT SO BAD FOR YOU WHEN YOU RETURNED FROM OPEN HEART SURGERY." I FEEL EVEN WORSE YOU SURVIVED. DID YOU WRITE THAT? KEN "IF YOU THINK YOU CAN FALL BACK ON YOUR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES, THINK AGAIN YOU CHUBBY CHUMP." PEACE. KEN, I'M PUTTING YOU DOWN AS A MAYBE ON ME, BUT I THINK I COULD WIN YOU OVER. THIS ONE FROM IOWA "ALL THIS HATE BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER GOTTEN AN INTERVIEW WITH DONALD TRUMP. WOW, WHAT A VINDICTIVE, HATEFUL," CANNOT SAY THAT WORD. I'VE HAD PLENTY OF INTERVIEWS WITH DONALD TRUMP OVER THE YEARS, PROBABLY DOZENS. I'VE JUST NOT ASKED FOR OR SHOWN INTEREST IN A CHAT WITH HIM AS PRESIDENT NOW. THAT DOES NOT MEAN I STILL DON'T COVER HIM. I'M JUST NOT INTERESTED IN JOINING THE CONGA LINE OF FOLKS EAGER TO INTERVIEW HIM. THEY ALL DO A GREAT JOB. THERE IS LITTLE I COULD ADD. IT'S NOT REALLY PERSONAL, IT'S JUST BUSINESS. CLYDE IN ATLANTA, "WOULD IT HAVE KILLED YOU JUST ONCE TO MENTION THE AMAZING MARKET RUN-UP UNDER HIS WATCH." I DID. I THINK A LOT MORE THAN JUST ONCE. THIS MARKET'S THE BOMB. WE ARE IN A STOCK BOMB CYCLONE. SOME HAVE A FEELING THERE'S GOT TO BE A SLOWDOWN HERE. WE DON'T SEE IT. A LOT OF THE RUN WE'VE SEEN IS MORE POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT. ANOTHER MILESTONE ON THE DOW TODAY. 25,000 NOW FOR THE MARKETS. IT'S BEEN A HISTORIC RUN. A LOT OF THESE GUYS MIGHT NOT BE BIG PERSONAL FANS OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY SURE AS HECK ARE BIG FANS OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS COOKING UP. BIG TAX CUTS. MY POINT WITH SHOWING OFF OF THAT IS TO STRESS COVERING THIS PRESIDENT, ANY PRESIDENT, ANY ISSUE. JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT ALWAYS PRAISING DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T MEAN I'M NEVER TRUMP ERROR WHATEVER THAT MEANS. KIM THINGS OTHERWISE. "YOU'RE THE FAKE NEWS NEVER TRUMPER THAT THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO WARN US ALL ABOUT, AND YOU'RE FAT, TOO." OKAY. I MOVE ON. FAKE NEWS WORKS BOTH WAYS, KIMMY. EVERY FACULTY PRESENTED LAST NIGHT WAS REAL. EVERY COMMENT I USED FROM THE PRESIDENT WAS HIS, NOT MY WORDS. HIS WORDS. WORD FOR WORD. NOT MY TWEET. HIS TWEET. NOTHING WAS FAKE. EVERYTHING I SHARED WAS REAL. NO MATTER, BILLY BOB E-MAILS "YOU'RE A SMOKE POMPOUS WIND BAG, I HOPE YOU CROAK ON THAT PORK CHOP TONIGHT." WAIT A MINUTE. HOW DID YOU KNOW I'M HAVING PORK CHOPS TONIGHT! "THIS ONE I'M DRAWN TO YOU FOR SOME REASON. LAST NIGHT MIGHT HAVE PROVED BY. GOOD JOB BEEF CAKES." BY THE WAY, IS THAT YOU? SHEILA "THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED FAIR AND BALANCED." ANGELA TWEETS, "I'LL START WATCHING YOU, NEIL. KEEP REPORTING THE TRUTH." BOB WRITES, "I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT YOU ARE SPOT-ON. HAVING A GREAT AGENDA AND RESULTS ARE NEGATED BY A CHILDISH BEHAVIOR." I'M NOT HERE TO PROVIDE LESSONS JUST FACTS. WORDS MATTER, YES TWEETS MATTER. I WON'T LECTURE YOU ABOUT LEET I WON'T LECTURE YOU ABOUT LEE I WON'T LECTURE YOU ABOUT EAE I WON'T LECTURE YOU ABOUT EATI I WON'T LECTURE YOU ABOUT EATING A SALAD. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE CAREFUL CALLING ANYONE ELSE BEING FAKE. I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT REAL. I HOPE YOU HAVE A REAL GOOD WEEKEND AND THINK TWICE ABOUT
