The Washington Post recently highlighted a study that says Church charts chains hearts and minds better than words do easier to read than say so Steve Rattner go ahead change our hearts and minds and tell us about the border cross well I'm not sure I can change our hearts and minds better than some of those pictures did which were so incredibly wrenching but I'll try to do better than words anyway so look let's try to dissect some of what Trump is saying because as usual it's filled with a number of falsehoods starting with his claim that the number of people crossing the border has exploded and so what you can see what he's talking about is he's comparing what's happening this year in terms of border apprehensions to what happened last year in 2017 but what he's ignoring is the fact that in three other previous years the rate of apprehensions was roughly the same as it is now so if you take out last year as an aberration there's really no particular change in the number of people trying to cross the border in fact this is also kind of a seasonal high and generally this declines as the Year wears on so that's sort of why number one that we can put to rest the second question is where does it stand relative to history and if you go back in history you can see that the number of border crossings in the last several years has been at the lowest level it's been since 1971 if you go back to the year 2000 was up over 1.6 million and so it is possible if you look at the little extrapolation we did here that the number of border crossings could be slightly higher this year than it was last year but we're bumping along at the bottom for a variety of reasons the financial crisis caused a lot of people from Mexico to decide the US wasn't actually such a great place to come after all things in Mexico notwithstanding some of what we saw there but in the broader Mexican economy have gotten better there are more jobs more things for people to do and so in fact the number of people are trying to cross the border has generally been trending down is any of that Steve tied to policy in other words President Obama who President Trump accused of having been weak on immigration weak at the border it is the economy yes but is there something that President Obama did to bring about that sort of precipitous drop during his two terms actually actually yes in fact I didn't show it in this graph but if you looked at the number of Border Patrol agents that have been assigned to the border it's been going up sharply over the last 15 years it's down a little bit lately because I think some budget cuts but it had been rising very sharply so yes we've done a lot more to enforce the the border and in fact Obama did consider policies like what Trump is doing but rejected the idea of separating families but he did step up the enforcement of the border of people trying to cross illegally but then lastly let's deal with this question of whether the people who come here is Trump famously setter rapists murderers and carrying drugs and a few good people and look at what the record is of immigrants who actually come to the country so what you can see here is that elite is that illegal immigrants actually are incarcerated at half the rate of native-born Americans and legal immigrants are actually incarcerated at an even lower rate than that and so this whole notion that we're bringing in gang members were bringing in people who are going to rape murder and pillage our country is simply not borne out by the facts all right Steve thank you so much coming up the US government says it seeks to promote quote humane international migration policies but when asked if the Trump separation policy was humane the acting director of ice couldn't bring himself to use the word will have us dance around the issue ahead plus current and former law enforcement officials send letters demanding the Trump administration and the policy will talk to the Attorney General of New Mexico and a former US Attorney lending their voices to the cause we'll be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up to date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
