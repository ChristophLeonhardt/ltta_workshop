football is fast upon us and the world's most profitable sport has its fans geared up and ready for kickoff this fall but the controversy surrounding the national anthem protests just won't seemed to die most recently being resurrected by the Titans own jerel Casey so here are a few useful tips and information on this plague of an issue when it's brought up this fall I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood the Kaepernick's original anthem protest started off the beginning of the fall 2016 meaning this protest started under Obama's America which is a whole other issue but this issue continued people protested long into 2017 the fallout of these protests being a full ten percent drop in viewership being mainly attributed to the anthem protests in response the NFL enacted a new policy now this might not seem like a big deal because the NFL was still profitable last year however as viewership fades so does every other Avenue use for revenue including retail and these effects can ripple down for years to come now the new NFL policy states all teams and league personnel on the field must stand and show respect for the flag during the anthem it also says personnel who choose not to stand for the national anthem may stay in the locker room or at a similar location off the field until after the anthem has been performed issue put to bed right wrong because the Tennessee Titans drove KC after he just got his forty million dollar guaranteed contract from the Titans said quote I'm gonna take a fine this year why not I'm gonna protest during the flag that's what I'm gonna say now unquote now here's how I suggest to talk about this issue for someone who may disagree with you and the tactics they used to Berets you won its freedom of speech response yes it is please tell me was he arrested and what jail are they holding him at of course not he still has the freedom to say whatever he wants employers had rules in place and he broke them freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of consequence and it certainly doesn't give you the freedom to tell someone else how to run their business or franchise and it definitely doesn't give you the freedom to tell the fans what they should stomach - this has nothing to do with the national anthem quit saying these millionaires hate the military or the country that gave them this this is a straw man when they say you believe this and you don't first off if it has nothing to do with the anthem a somber and visceral moment for millions of Americans why protests during said anthem there are people protesting all over the United States and all kinds of from locations all the time do you really think everyone who disagrees with it doesn't like what you're talking about or the fact that you're doing it the way you're doing it let me give you an example that's like me going to Washington DC to the Martin Luther King Monument taking rocks and throwing it at the Statue while screaming about the minimum wage and you say dude quit being disrespectful and I say whoa you're an idiot this has nothing to do with Martin Luther King this has everything to do with minimum wage get over it three it's not affecting the NFL then FL still makes money it still finds me when people will act so progressive and virtuous in their talk when it comes down to real-world implications they sing a different tune quick it's almost like when the Democrats were voting to abolish ice and almost none of them voted to do it but they will still virtue signal to their base about it for example Jerry Jones the owner of the Cowboys who literally runs everything inside now knows all the financial dealings tried to find a two-state solution to this issue he did this by locking our manam in the middle of the field in front of everybody with his entire team and then kneeled after the national anthem in hopes that the rest this season would be focused on football spoiler it wasn't and by the end of the season he said the Cowboys were quote suffering the negative effects from these protests and threatened to bench any player who took a knee unquote oh and it's not just him only one of the 32 team owners voted to not implement these new rules meaning almost everyone agreed that this is a problem needs to be addressed and only one owner said they'd be willing to pay the fines that's how much a 10% drop in viewership will cost in the future and these guys know way more about the financial dealings than I do and that's the truth no matter how much the media tries to butter it up four players are being coerced and forced to do things they don't believe in first off for 40 million dollars or even the league minimum of $450,000 anyone the United States would hold up a jar of Vegemite and say hey this is the greatest sandwich spread on earth you need to buy it even if we didn't believe it because you are paid to do so no one has a gun to the back of your head saying you have to do this you get to choose if the salary is worth the job that you take and all that it implies but then this is an effect then playing football no it probably doesn't it affects the game and the entire experience it's a product we don't just watch kickoffs we don't just watch commercials we tune in to hear the announcers talk we listen to the press conferences and we tune in to hear amazing artists sing our national anthem and have the players we love stand in attendance and you are paid to be a part of said experience of said product it's not just about in cleats and tackling somebody in the interview trail case you said quote I'm gonna take my phone it is what it is I ain't gonna let them stop me from doing what I want to do and if they want to have these battles between players and organizations this is the way it's gonna be unquote first off you're making this a fight your organization just paid you 40 million in guaranteed money because they like you second I assume Casey knows that the owners of the organization's can choose to absorb these costs if they choose to but I hope Casey puts his money where his mouth is here so when these fines start doling out he can take the responsibility of standing on a field and virtue signaling or protesting our most sacred song and it's been said it's not about the anthem it's about the people they want to help which if he is so passion about helping the communities that he's talking about helping I think it'd be a waste and a shame to completely blow these hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines that you could be pouring into a community and organizations and nonprofits that will help these communities instead of taking the more sexy route of parading yourself on the field as a voluntary martyr by accumulating these fines but hey what do I know he's free to do so and here's the thing I think when these issues are spelled out people can really come to an understanding and agreement on this it's not racist or bigoted or misinformed to not like people taking that very weighted moment to protest and people who protest don't necessarily hate the country they don't have to get out though if you do hate America and hate this country you can literally go to another country and enjoy some soccer or cricket but you won't honestly the only thing that gives me hope about this situation is that it shows freedom and democracy working in real time players chose to do something fans didn't like it so owners adjust it and the market will take care of itself just like you can't force people to like soccer you can't force people to not be offended when someone protests during the national anthem and you certainly can't force fans to continue to support and pay for a product that they disagree with I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood in awesome
