YEARS OF PAINSTAKING RESEARCH,
LOOKING AT SOCIAL MEDIA
INTERCEPTS AND TELEVISION
INTERCEPTS AND THEY SAID TODAY
THAT THEY CAN CONFIRM THIS IS A

STEP IN THIS PROCESS?

THEY MADE THIS ANNOUNCE MEANT
TODAY IS A FEW YEARS AGO, THEY
SAID THEY HAD HUNDREDS OF
SUSPECTS.
THEY HAVE NARROWS THAT DOWN TO A
FEW DOZEN AND THEY WANT TO
PROCEED WITH A CRIMINAL CASE.
THEY SAY IF THEY CAN'T GET THE
SUSPECTS TO THEM IN HOLLAND,
THEY WILL CONTINUE AND TRY THEM
IN ABSENTIA.
THEY SAY THEY HAVE ASKED FOR
HELP FROM WITNESSES WHO CAN
TESTIFY ABOUT THE INVOLVEMENT
WITH THE RUSSIAN MILITARY,
PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEEN THIS
ROCKET BEING FIRED.
PEOPLE THAT WERE PART OF THE
BRIGADE.
RUSSIA HAS FLOATED A NUMBER OF
THEORIES OF THEIR OWN SUGGESTING
THAT THE UKRAINE WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR SHOOTING DOWN THE PLANE.
RUSSIA HAS USED THEIR VETO POWER
