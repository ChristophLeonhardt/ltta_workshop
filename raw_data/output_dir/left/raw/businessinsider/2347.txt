00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,730
Jeff thanks for being with us what are

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,500
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bigger more popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sub</font>

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">sectors of the green initiative right</font>

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,609
now well i would say for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us you know</font>

5
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of runs the gamut you know you have</font>

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,720
your energy stocks you have organic and

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,970
natural food stocks environmental

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,070
remediation companies but primarily we

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,240
focus on renewable energy and

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,180
alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy technologies</font>

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,559
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's where the money</font>

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,860
be like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so what</font>

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,100
were the green advances in 2009 well and

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,440
the reasons behind them well it's

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,370
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say by</font>

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,690
and large policy that a lot to do with

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">it not just in the US but in China as</font>

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,890
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know China had a great year for</font>

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,260
solar and wind and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stems</font>

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,030
from not just the fact that they can

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,530
produce this stuff a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheaper not</font>

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,870
quicker than than anyone else but the

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,550
Chinese government<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a very aggressive</font>

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,570
energy policy in place and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,939
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on new alternative</font>

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,979
energy integration so it's China at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,869
forefront in terms of developing green

29
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,939
technology are they one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the countries</font>

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,380
that are ahead of the game they're ahead

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,210
of the game as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as utilizing it we</font>

32
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,890
developed most of this technology a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,150
of the technology that we see today has

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">been developed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US and in Japan</font>

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe as well but again I mean</font>

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,659
China has basically taken what we've

37
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed and has been able to again</font>

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,320
produce it much quicker and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,640
cheaper than<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can and that's</font>

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,710
definitely given competitive advantage

41
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,659
because really in a world of renewable

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,119
energy you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Costas is key at this</font>

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,070
point in the game so are they more a

44
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,850
huge opportunity or they a threat a huge

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,500
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> agent absolutely huge</font>

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,530
opportunity you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> even see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now you</font>

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,409
know with china's energy policies going

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,799
forth they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become not only</font>

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,329
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the large manufacturers but</font>

50
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,380
they're gonna be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the large new</font>

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,140
markets and you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of works</font>

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,540
both ways because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese government</font>

53
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,340
is supporting these new solar companies

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,780
and these wind turbine manufacturers in

55
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,370
these battery companies because they

56
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the solar pan</font>

57
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,710
in the cells and the wind turbines<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

58
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,880
batteries but they're also taking them

59
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,320
outside they're also exporting this

60
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,480
stuff to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point even that here in the</font>

61
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,860
US you know we have you know the funding

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,000
that's in place that government is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to is going to fund a lot of these new</font>

64
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,180
manufacturing facilities so now you have

65
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,710
China<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually coming here and studying</font>

66
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,270
facilities the United States which is

67
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,490
really unheard of usually everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

68
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,910
made in<font color="#CCCCCC"> china</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

69
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,490
now the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> market is just so hot here</font>

70
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,710
and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese know that if they</font>

71
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,210
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a piece of that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

72
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,010
that stimulus money they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

73
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,740
have to set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> shop here and employ</font>

74
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,180
domestic<font color="#E5E5E5"> us workers and that's what</font>

75
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,070
we're seeing now right and what about

76
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe what did you seen over there</font>

77
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,340
you're you know Germany especially

78
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,460
really you can thank Germany for really

79
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,670
pushing solar forward and last decade or

80
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">so with their feed-in tariffs and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

81
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">were very very supportive that really</font>

82
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">helped the the global solar industry</font>

83
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,020
move forward at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

84
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,850
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of manufacturing in in</font>

85
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,160
Germany it's still very strong but we're

86
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,780
starting to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the Germans now</font>

87
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,750
importing some Chinese solar cells and

88
00:03:19,750 --> 00:00:00,000
solar panels great thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you my pleasure</font>
