1
00:00:00,504 --> 00:00:03,006
SAID THE MOVE SUPPORTS AND

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:03,707
ENCOURAGES MORE PARTICIPATION

3
00:00:03,707 --> 00:00:06,309
WHICH ULTIMATELY WAS ALWAYS THE

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,810
GOAL.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,010
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,578
MUCH.

7
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:10,781
YOU'RE WITH MORE

8
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:14,217
AINSLEY EARHARDT AND MIKE.

9
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:18,155
AND CAT TIM, FOX NEWS

10
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:19,189
CONTRIBUTOR.

11
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,257
I SAID CHEERLEADING REJECTS ALL,

12
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:25,228
IS THAT TRUE?

13
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:25,662
>> ABSOLUTELY.

14
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:26,429
YEARS AFTER YEAR AND FOR SOME

15
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,497
REASON IT DIDN'T WORK.

16
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:29,332
I DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A PSYCHO

17
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:29,900
MOTHER FREAKING OUT.

18
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,268
>> Martha: DON'T YOU FEEL BAD

19
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:32,936
FOR THIS KID WHOSE MOTHER RAISED

20
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:37,040
HOLY HELL AND EVERYBODY'S GOT TO

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,808
BE ON THE TEAM.

22
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:38,842
>> CONGRATULATIONS TO THIS MOM

23
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:39,709
BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER HAS NO

24
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,812
FRIENDS WHATSOEVER.

25
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:43,213
YOU TALK ABOUT MEAN GIRLS.

26
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,615
SHE WILL SEE ME AND GIRLS IN

27
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:46,349
ACTION BECAUSE THIS MOTHER

28
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:47,617
TAKING THINGS TO A WHOLE

29
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:48,351
DIFFERENT LEVEL AND ABSOLUTELY

30
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:51,221
BEING CRAZY ABOUT IT.

31
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:52,622
THE ENTITLEMENT SOCIETY SIDE OF

32
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:53,723
IT, WE ALL EXPECT THINGS TO BE

33
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:54,324
HANDED TO US.

34
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:56,459
>> Martha: THIS IS NOT HELPFUL

35
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:57,794
MOM.

36
00:00:57,794 --> 00:00:58,662
>> I WAS A CHEERLEADER IN

37
00:00:58,662 --> 00:00:59,095
SEVENTH GRADE.

38
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:00,997
EIGHTH GRADE I TRIED OUT AND I

39
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:04,233
WAS CUT FROM THE TEAM.

40
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,403
BROKEN HEARTED, CRIED, SO UPSET.

41
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:07,504
MY DAD COMES UPSTAIRS, HE SITS

42
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:08,738
ON MY BED AND HE SAYS SOMEONE

43
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:10,941
ELSE NEEDED THAT SPOT.

44
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:11,608
YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH, GOD

45
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:13,643
CREATED YOU TO BE STRONG ENOUGH.

46
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:15,345
WE WERE GIVING UP YOUR SPOT TO

47
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:16,179
ANOTHER GIRL WHO MIGHT NOT BE

48
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:17,814
STRONG ENOUGH CAN TAKE IT.

49
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:19,115
THAT WAS SUCH A VALUABLE LESSON.

50
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:19,983
>> Martha: AND YOU SAID NO,

51
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:22,018
DAD, I WANT THE SPOT AND YOUR

52
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:23,854
MOM WENT AND GOT IT FOR YOU.

53
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:25,388
>> I THOUGHT WOW AND MY DAD

54
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:26,590
TOTALLY TURNED IT AROUND AND

55
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,227
SPUN IT WHERE I GOT INTO THAT.

56
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:30,961
THAT'S GOOD.

57
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,830
>> AND YOU ARE SOMEHOW OKAY NOW.

58
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,798
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO RECOVER.

59
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:35,866
>> Martha: ALL BECAUSE YOU GOT

60
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,200
CUT FROM THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD.

61
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,368
>> I WAS CUT FROM THE

62
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:40,237
CHEERLEADING SQUAD AND I WAS SO

63
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:41,838
BAD THAT I REALLY HAD SOME NERVE

64
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:42,839
TO EVEN WASTE ANYONE'S TIME BY

65
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,442
TRYING OUT WHATSOEVER.

66
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:46,943
BUT I JUST, INSTEAD, JOINED THE

67
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:50,413
MOCK TRIAL TEAM AND HAD SOME FUN

68
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:51,581
THERE AND WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO

69
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,450
PURSUE SOMETHING AS GOOD AT

70
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,051
RATHER THAN ALLOWING MYSELF TO

71
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:55,585
EMBARRASS MYSELF BY

72
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:56,419
SOMERSAULTING UP ON THE FOOTBALL

73
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:57,621
FIELD BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T EVEN

74
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:58,421
DO A CARTWHEEL.

75
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:00,223
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR

76
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:00,624
ANYONE.

77
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:01,892
>> WHERE THOSE KIDS ARE SO BAD

78
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,060
ON "AMERICAN IDOL."

79
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,595
>> Martha: I WAS A CHEERLEADER

80
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:07,831
FOR LIKE A LONG TIME.

81
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:08,598
MIDDLE SCHOOL, ALL THROUGH

82
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:08,999
HIGH SCHOOL.

83
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,435
WHEN I HAD MY DAUGHTER I HID MY

84
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:13,203
CHEERLEADING PICTURES BECAUSE I

85
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,271
KNEW THAT IF SHE SOUGHT SHE

86
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:15,839
WOULD BE LIKE, I WANT TO BE A

87
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,207
CHEERLEADER AND I DIDN'T WANT

88
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,441
HER TO BE A CHEERLEADER.

89
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,644
I WANTED HER TO BE ON MOCK

90
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:21,511
TRIAL, WHICH SHE DID END UP

91
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,946
DOING AND SHE BECAME AN ATHLETE

92
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:24,047
AND A SOCCER PLAYER AND ALL THIS

93
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,850
COOL STUFF BECAUSE, HONESTLY, I

94
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,985
THINK THEY SHOULD DO AWAY WITH

95
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:29,419
CHEERLEADING.

96
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,021
I WAS THE HEAD OF THE FORCE.

97
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,022
YOU STAND ON THE SIDELINES AND

98
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:34,224
YOU CHEER FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

99
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:35,091
IT'S LIKE GET OUT THERE AND DO

100
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:37,594
IT YOURSELF.

101
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,095
WHO NEEDS TO LEARN TO DANCE?

102
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:43,233
I WANTED TO LEARN --

103
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,167
>> I'M STILL TRYING TO LEARN.

104
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,769
>> Martha: I WAS TOLD THAT FOR

105
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,270
THE CHEERLEADERS BECAUSE WHEN I

106
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,205
WAS A CHEERLEADER I ACTUALLY

107
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,440
THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE WATCHING OUR

108
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,041
ROUTINES.

109
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,510
THEY ARE NOT WATCHING YOUR

110
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,044
ROUTINE.

111
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:55,245
THEY ARE WATCHING FOOTBALL.

112
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:56,646
THEY ARE WATCHING BASKETBALL AND

113
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:57,547
IT'S LIKE THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD

114
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:58,048
ONE.

115
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:58,982
WE DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.

116
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:01,618
PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK.

117
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:03,820
>> THESE ARE FROM A STORY FROM

118
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,255
FAILURE, OBVIOUSLY WE WILL ALL

119
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:06,623
FAIL IN LIFE BUT MICHAEL JORDAN

120
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:07,257
GOT CUT FROM HIS FRESHMAN

121
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:09,592
HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM.

122
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:10,293
MICHAEL JORDAN, THE GREATEST

123
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:12,262
PLAYER OF ALL TIME.

124
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:12,762
HE GOT THROUGH IT.

125
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:13,496
AND IT JUST MAKES YOU STRONGER

126
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:16,399
AND BETTER.

127
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,634
>> INCLUSIVENESS IS GREAT, BUT

128
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:18,501
IT DOESN'T CHANGE REALITY.

129
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:19,502
JUST BECAUSE THEY ALLOW EVERYONE

130
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:20,303
TO MAKE THAT YOUR LIMITING, THAT

131
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,405
SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

132
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,139
ABOUT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE

133
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,442
STILL A BAD CHEERLEADER.

134
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:26,710
YOU ARE JUST LETTING EVERYBODY

135
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,043
ENOUGH.

136
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:28,044
>> DO YOU THINK WHEN THEY WILL

137
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:29,646
LOOK BACK AT THESE VIDEOS AND

138
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:31,214
SAY I WAS CRYING AND TWEETING.

139
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:32,415
>> Martha: OF COURSE THEY ARE,

140
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,650
WHICH IS WHY THEY SHOULD BE

141
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,384
PLAYING SOCCER OR BASKETBALL,

142
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:35,952
BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL FEEL GOOD

143
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,654
ABOUT -- THEY WILL FEEL SO MUCH

144
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:38,455
BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES.

145
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,622
AINSLEY IS GOING TO COVER THE

146
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:41,257
ROYAL WEDDING AND YOU ARE

147
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:41,758
LEAVING TONIGHT.

148
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:44,894
>> I'M LEAVING TOMORROW NIGHT.

149
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:47,831
>> Martha: I DID THE LAST ONE.

150
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,668
POOR MEGHAN MARKLE.

151
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:52,669
HER FATHER APPARENTLY PAID THE

152
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,838
PAPARAZZI TO TAKE PICTURES OF

153
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:56,072
HIM GETTING MEASURED FOR HIS

154
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,807
TUXEDO AND LOOKING AT A COMPUTER

155
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:58,375
SCREEN AT STARBUCKS.

156
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,177
THERE HE IS.

157
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:04,147
HE WAS LOOKING AT PICTURES OF

158
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:05,015
HER AND HARRY ONLINE AND

159
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:06,016
EVERYTHING AND IT TURNED OUT

160
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,450
THAT IT WAS A PAPARAZZI DEAL

161
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,251
THAT HE MIGHT'VE EVEN MADE SOME

162
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,252
MONEY OFF OF AND NOW HE'S NOT

163
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,087
GOING TO THE WEDDING.

164
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:11,821
>> YOU DON'T NEED THAT KIND OF

165
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:14,224
DRAMA ON YOUR WEDDING DAY.

166
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:15,225
PROBABLY GOT ENOUGH DRAMA HAVING

167
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,226
SUCH A FAMOUS WEDDING BUT TO

168
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,360
HAVE YOUR DAD TO SOMETHING LIKE

169
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,428
THAT, I WOULD BE SO MAD AT MY

170
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:19,696
DAD.

171
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,464
>> IT'S A LACK OF TRUST ALREADY.

172
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,532
FROM THE BEGINNING, FROM THE

173
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:24,334
ONSET WITH THE MOST FAMOUS

174
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:25,902
COUPLE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

175
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:28,438
I'M JUST VERY DEPRESSED THAT I

176
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:29,072
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE WITH

177
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:31,207
MEGHAN MARKLE ANYMORE.

178
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:32,609
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT HARRY?

179
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:33,109
ALL THOSE GIRLS.

180
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:35,612
WHEN WE DID WILLIAMS WEDDING,

181
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,614
THEY GAVE UP HIS LITTLE PENS

182
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:38,348
THAT SAID DON'T WORRY, YOU CAN

183
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:41,151
STILL MARRY HARRY BECAUSE

184
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:42,018
WILLIAM WAS GONE.

185
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:43,019
YOU'VE GOT A STORY NOW.

186
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,054
THIS WILL BE VERY INTERESTING.

187
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:44,921
>> I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

188
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,023
I'M HAPPY FOR HER BECAUSE SHE

189
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:49,059
HAS THE ULTIMATE CINDERELLA

190
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:49,826
STORY.

191
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:50,527
IT'S AMAZING WHAT SHE'S BEEN

192
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:53,930
THROUGH AND HOW FAR SHE'S COME

193
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,664
AND EVERYONE, EVERY BOOK I'VE

194
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,666
READ IN EVERY ARTICLE I'VE READ,

195
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,967
SHE WAS A HARD WORKER AND SHE

196
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:58,668
REALLY DESERVED THIS AND SHE

197
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:00,837
SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PERSON.

198
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:02,472
BUT HER DAD TO DO THIS, HER

199
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,606
BROTHER WOULD SEND MESSAGES TO

200
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:05,809
HARRY, DON'T DO IT.

201
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,811
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE

202
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:09,245
CINDERELLA STORY BECAUSE SHE HAS

203
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:09,646
THE FAMILY.

204
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:10,580
THE DAD IS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY

205
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,850
OR HIS FRIEND IS THE

206
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,484
PHOTOGRAPHER MAKING MONEY.

207
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:16,686
THEY COULDN'T FIND THE TAILOR.

208
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,788
THEY WENT UP TO SOME KID AND

209
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,457
SAID WILL YOU ACT LIKE YOU ARE

210
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:20,990
THE TAYLOR?

211
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,992
>> THEY GAVE HIM A MEASURING

212
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:25,695
TAPE.

213
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:26,863
>> Martha: HER MOTHER SHOULD

214
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:27,831
WALK HER DOWN THE AISLE.

215
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:28,832
THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE

216
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:29,933
FOR HER AND HER MOTHER IS

217
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,134
LOVELY, SHE'S GOING TO BE THERE

218
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,535
AND SHE SHOULD WALK HER DOWN THE

219
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:32,836
AISLE.

220
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:34,037
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

221
00:05:34,037 --> 00:00:00,000
GREAT TO HAVE YOU GUYS HERE.
