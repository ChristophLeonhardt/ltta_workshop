1
00:00:01,348 --> 00:00:02,115
MAYBE TWO FBI INVESTIGATIONS

2
00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:06,353
BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW.

3
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,454
THE ACLU HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG

4
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:08,622
TIME AND IT'S BUILT ITS

5
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:11,458
REPUTATION DEFENDING FREE SPEECH

6
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,659
AND ESPECIALLY DUE PROCESS

7
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,661
ESPECIALLY FOR THE POLITICALLY

8
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:15,529
UNPOPULAR.

9
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:16,663
IT SAVED THE LIVES AT THE

10
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:18,932
BEGINNING OF ITS EXISTENCE,

11
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:21,435
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE

12
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:21,735
ACLU.

13
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,504
THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE BEING

14
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:27,141
WASHED AWAY IN THE TIDE OF

15
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:28,375
DERANGEMENT IN THE ACLU HAS

16
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,810
DECIDED TO JOIN THAT TIDE.

17
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,512
THEY ARE RUNNING AN AD DECLARING

18
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:32,746
HIM GUILTY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR

19
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:35,249
A TRIAL OR ANY EVIDENCE, WATCH.

20
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:38,519
>> WE SEEN THIS BEFORE, DENIALS

21
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:40,187
FROM POWERFUL MEN.

22
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:41,622
>> I DID NOT HAVE RELATIONS WITH

23
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:43,857
THAT WOMAN.

24
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:46,927
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

25
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:47,227
THIS.

26
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:49,063
>> I CATEGORICALLY AND

27
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:50,965
UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED THE

28
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:51,999
ALLEGATION AGAINST ME.

29
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:54,234
>> AMERICA IS WATCHING AND AS WE

30
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,737
CHOOSE A LIFETIME SEAT ON OUR

31
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:58,138
HIGHEST COURT, INTEGRITY MATTERS

32
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:02,743
AND WE CANNOT HAVE ANY DOUBT.

33
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:03,410
SENATOR GARDNER, OPPOSE THE

34
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,547
CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

35
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,982
>> Tucker: CHRIS HAHN IS A

36
00:01:07,982 --> 00:01:09,517
RADIO SHOW HOST, PROBABLY A

37
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:10,918
DONOR TO THE ACLU WHEN HE JOINS

38
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:13,220
US TONIGHT, IT'S GREAT TO SEE

39
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,522
YOU.

40
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:16,924
YOU ARE PUSHING LATE MIDDLE AGE,

41
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:18,159
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH

42
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,327
TO KNOW WHAT THE ACLU HAS BEEN

43
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,829
DOING.

44
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,964
>> LATE?

45
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,533
>> Tucker: WHATEVER.

46
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,134
YOU'RE PROBABLY OVER 30.

47
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,136
YOU'VE WATCHED THE ACLU OVER

48
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,004
TIME AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE

49
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,540
FOUNDED TO DEFEND FREE SPEECH

50
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:39,246
AND DUE PROCESS, A MAN IS GUILTY

51
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:43,351
ON THE BASIS OF NO EVIDENCE, HE

52
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,752
SHARES SOME RESEMBLANCE TO TWO

53
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:46,754
OTHER GUYS WHO ARE PROBABLY

54
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:47,522
GUILTY.

55
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:49,557
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF DUE

56
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:52,260
PROCESS, WHY IS THE ACLU DOING

57
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,928
THIS?

58
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:55,696
>> THEY'RE NOT DECLARING HIM

59
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:59,233
GUILTY, WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO

60
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,334
AND GUILT OR INNOCENCE IS REALLY

61
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:01,135
NOT THE ISSUE.

62
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:02,637
HE'S NOT ON TRIAL FOR HIS LIFE

63
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:04,739
HE'S APPLYING FOR A JOB.

64
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,707
WE'VE GOT TO ASK THE QUESTION,

65
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,109
HAS HE BEEN TRUTHFUL IN THAT

66
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:10,077
INQUIRY IN THE ANSWER IS NO.

67
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:14,549
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE ABOUT THE

68
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:15,249
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION ALL

69
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:20,821
THAT AWAY           I

70
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,889
DO BELIEVE DR. FORD.

71
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,925
>> Tucker: BEFORE WE GET TO

72
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:24,659
WHAT YOU THINK HE SPECIFICALLY

73
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,061
LIED ABOUT I WANT TO REWIND

74
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:27,728
SECOND.

75
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:29,564
YOU'RE SAYING THAT WITHOUT

76
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:30,765
FINDING SOMEONE GUILTY OF

77
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:32,033
ANYTHING IT'S OKAY TO DESTROY

78
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,334
HIS REPUTATION TO THE POINT

79
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:34,569
WHERE HE CAN'T GET A PAYING WORK

80
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,738
AND CAN'T GET THE JOB THAT HE

81
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:37,338
WAS NOMINATED FOR BY THE

82
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:40,141
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

83
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,076
HE JUST HAS TO WITHDRAW AS A

84
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:43,478
LECTURER AT HARVARD BECAUSE HIS

85
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:45,546
REPUTATION HAS BEEN SO SULLIED.

86
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:48,316
HE HASN'T BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF

87
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:49,584
ANYTHING, BUT THAT'S OKAY WITH

88
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:50,551
YOU BECAUSE WE AREN'T IN A TRIAL

89
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:51,519
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

90
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,523
IS THAT THE NEW STANDARD?

91
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,926
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU HAVE

92
00:02:57,926 --> 00:02:59,360
TO ASK THE QUESTION IS THIS MAN

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,729
FIT FOR A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT

94
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,865
THAT WILL NEVER, EVER FACE THE

95
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:05,867
VOTERS, NEVER FACE CONGRESS

96
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:10,338
AGAIN.

97
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:11,339
IF YOU FEEL HE HASN'T BEEN

98
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:12,640
TRUTHFUL TO THAT COMMITTEE, I

99
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,408
WILL TELL YOU, I DON'T THINK HE

100
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:15,310
WAS TRUTHFUL.

101
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,379
>> Tucker: HE'S LIED, BUT

102
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,216
THAT'S UNPROVABLE.

103
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:28,023
IF YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART -- IF

104
00:03:28,023 --> 00:03:30,058
I FEEL IN MY HEART THAT YOU'RE A

105
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,326
CHILD MOLESTER, CAN I SAY THAT

106
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:34,629
ON TV AND SEE HOW IT AFFECTS HER

107
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,133
FAMILY?

108
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,901
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO GET A

109
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:41,436
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT ON THE

110
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,939
BENCH OF NO ONE IS ACCUSING ME

111
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:45,207
OF ANYTHING WHO DID NOT COME

112
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:48,510
FORWARD CREDIBLY.

113
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,945
>> Tucker: HE'S BEEN ACCUSED

114
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:52,347
OF A LOT OF THINGS, CREDIBLY IS

115
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:54,549
A SUBJECTIVE TERM.

116
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,118
IS IT OKAY IF YOU FEEL IN YOUR

117
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:59,154
HEARTS THAT SOMEONE IS GUILTY TO

118
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:00,355
SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROY HIM AND

119
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:01,523
HIS FAMILY AND YOU'RE SAYING

120
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:06,695
YES, IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

121
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:09,831
>> DID YOU FIND DR. FORD

122
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:10,332
CREDIBLE?

123
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:13,001
>> Tucker: I'M NOT SURE, SHE

124
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,135
WASN'T ASKED REAL QUESTIONS.

125
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,505
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN DID YOU RECALL

126
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:18,339
THIS.

127
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,940
DID YOU TELL YOUR THERAPIST

128
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,541
ABOUT OF?

129
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,911
THAT'S A BASIC QUESTION NOBODY

130
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,211
ASKED.

131
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:27,082
>> YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW

132
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:29,384
THAT TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE --

133
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,820
>> Tucker: I DON'T KNOW WHAT I

134
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,821
KNOW, THAT'S WHY I ASKED REAL

135
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:36,191
QUESTIONS ON MY SHOW.

136
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,960
>> I FOUND HER CREDIBLE AND I

137
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,997
THINK YOU FOUND HER CREDIBLE TO

138
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:45,701
TOO.

139
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,336
HE LIED ABOUT WHAT THE CLUB WAS,

140
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:51,139
HE LIED TO CONGRESS >> Tucker:

141
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:51,940
YOU'RE SAYING HE LIED ABOUT THE

142
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,345
RALPH CLUB?

143
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:58,147
YOU LIE ABOUT THE RALPH CLUB AND

144
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:00,349
YOU'RE DONE, I FEEL THAT IN MY

145
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:00,649
HEART.

146
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:05,621
THIS IS SO CRAZY.

147
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,524
>> WHY LIE ABOUT IT?

148
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,326
MY THING IS WHY LIE ABOUT THAT?

149
00:05:10,326 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WAS SOMETHING HE COULD HAVE
