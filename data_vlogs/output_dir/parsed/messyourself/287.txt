this is where they fell and died and I
bet the bloody monster whatever the shit
ate them but then again we saw from the
intro a man a killer so is there another
killer yeah that's a good point actually
at the beginning of the game we saw a
man who shot out fire and tried to grab
Hanna and Beth wait Hanna's arm right so
maybe there's a fireman Oh - OH - 14 who
wrote that

guys won't leave I don't know okay it
not say that didn't feel right all right
I'll be back see if there's the
character to die it should be by the
hands of the monster not bloody myself
we gotta go killing her each other all
right we got damn a Josh killing our
friends I thought that that
he was gonna help us with a flamethrower
dude now we don't have a chance
Oh God it just means we've got to be
tough you've got to do this on her own I
don't know if I can damn
Oh we're finding out all shit I am
reading this shit the wendigo grows out
of cannibalism when a human is desperate
and craves food trapped on the mountain
in the face winter storms when he has
eaten nothing for many days the wendigo
spirit will begin to possess him even
the strongest man is weak to it he will
kill without remorse the Cree believed
it was bad luck to hum an animal on the
mountain and would hunt elsewhere uh-oh
that means when we killed that squirrel
earlier that was bad uh-oh in 1893 the
miners arrived they found tin and later
traces of radium they mined deep into
the sacred mountain the Kree say that
the mountain cried out and the Spirit
was released so so mining this sacred
mountain made these spirits come alive
is that it this is that because the
Wonder gozar mutated from humans when
they hunt us they know how to perfectly
mimic their prey whoa that's creepy
the Wendigo sees movement it is a hunter
like a hawk but it cannot see stillness
if you are totally still then the
Wendigo will not be able to see you who
the skin and flesh of the Wendigo are
hard like armored they seem to feel no
pain they cannot be cut or stabbed damn
I have killed six Wendigos neither
bullets will not harm them use a
flamethrower damn try not to kill them
killing a Wendigo should be the last
resort death releases the Wendigo spirit
into the air what hang on a second you
don't think that monster is Hannah as a
Wendigo
no way I hope not there we go the bite
is harmless I have been bitten but I did
not change see I told you
imagine we killed her and then read that
book we'd have been like
shit we shouldn't have really killed us
should we know what was the same
reassure em you'll be okay okay yeah
riche aura it says that the bytes it if
it bites you it's not infectious it
doesn't do anything there we go and let
me sorry I'm sorry what did you say
umm so shall be your grades as what
since you'll be okay fine
why is her scary she oh damn that's a
fair she was scared
I'm the one who's scared sorry I'm sorry
Emily I didn't know what was going now
Hatter none of us know
there's no excuse there's no excuse of
it please just really understand I don't
understand oh sorry oh sorry
shit yeah you've got to get to Mike whoa
why now why why why I'd have to get to
Mike oh shit what's gonna happen next
time
I am I'm excited to see that baby
Oh Josh so Josh was the guy I love
listen to me
Josh healthier choices people have died
I don't know which is worse
actively triggering events that lead to
someone's death or passively allowing a
tragedy to occur because you couldn't
lift a goddamn finger to help someone
else remember last year huh are you left
your poor sisters to die cuz I was
drugged did nothing to help paralyzed by
your own self-centered fear while the
real threat was closing in oh it's all
about you Josh it's always all about you
damn
oh-ho-ho shit get rekt hey no tissue
terribly wrong your friends like your
sisters have deserted you you're all
alone Oh is he alive still and you feel
how cold your long illness hasn't become
oh don't be mean Joshua why did you hurt
them they hurt me but they didn't hurt
you Joshua
not intentionally they made a stupid
mistake and a terrible tragedy befell
your sister I did not intend for that to
happen
still though did and they were sorry at
least until you subjected them to your
night of a horrific torture maybe
psychology yes being so smart I'm so
sorry
they were just again just just a game it
says that I came to you streaming you to
one of your own deepest fears
Joshua doclet dumbass
hi
