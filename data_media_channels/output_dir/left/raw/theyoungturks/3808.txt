1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:08,320
TRUMP WENT TO FRANCE AND HE
CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,490
OF THE UNITED STATES ENTERING
WORLD WAR I.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,090
AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR THESE KINDS
OF COMMEMORATIONS THERE WAS A

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,740
BIG MILITARY SPECTACLE AND
PARADE.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,650
DONALD TRUMP WAS SO TAKEN WITH
IT THAT HE DECIDED TO THE

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,090
PRESIDENT OF FRANCE THAT HE
WANTS TO DO ONE OF THOSE

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,090
HIMSELF.

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,260
THIS IS TYPICAL TRUMP, HE
THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT, IT IS

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,210
CONSISTENT, WITH WHAT HE HAS
SAID IN THE PAST.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:55,399
THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID
ABOUT THIS.

11
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:03,210
OF COURSE THE FIRST THING I
THOUGHT OF WAS JULY 4 WEEKEND

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,470
HE'S GOING TO BE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE?

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,000
HE WILL BE IN THE HAMPTONS OR
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,760
WHAT THIS SPEAKS TO,
THIS WHOLE IDEA ñ

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,670
WHERE DO PEOPLE HEAR AND SEE
THESE THINGS.

16
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:31,869
BLACK-AND-WHITE FILMS FROM THE
HISTORY CHANNEL OF PEOPLE

17
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,890
MARCHING UP CHAMPS TO
THE ARC TO

18
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:45,630
TRIUMPH.

19
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:57,649
HE FOR HIS INAUGURATION ASKED
SOMETHING WORTH COMMEMORATING.

20
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,220
WHEN TRUMP SEES THE
SORT OF THING ñ

21
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,900
HE WANTED TO DO THIS FOR HIS
INAUGURATION.

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,189
HE LOVES THIS STUFF BUT IT SHOWS
THESE ARE THE STRAINS OF AN

23
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:11,189
AUTHORITARIAN.

24
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,620
THIS IS NOT JUST AMERICA PROUD.

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,900
THIS IS SCARY STUFF, THE KIND OF
STUFF THAT AUTHORITARIAN WANTS.

26
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,980
ALSO IF ANYONE IN OUR AUDIENCE
DOESN'T BUY INTO THE

27
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,129
AUTHORITARIAN WHICH IS A GREAT
POINT, KEEP IN MIND THAT TRUMP

28
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:32,859
ARGUED THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO
BAN TRANSGENDER MILITARY

29
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:35,069
MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO
COSTLY.

30
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,010
STUDIES OF INDICATED THAT IS NOT
THE CASE.

31
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,989
TAKING THEM OUT OF THE MILITARY
AND REPLACING THEM WOULD BE

32
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:47,819
INSANELY COSTLY, BUT YOU HAVE
THE RESOURCES ON A MILITARY

33
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,139
PARADE WHICH IS COMPLETELY
UNNECESSARY.

34
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,249
BUT YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP
PAY FOR THE MEDICAL BILLS

35
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,040
OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE WILLING
TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,709
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
THEIR GENDER IDENTITY.

37
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,499
IS SO ENRAGING.

38
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:08,290
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF HIS
SUPPORTERS WOULD WANT SOMETHING

39
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,110
LIKE THIS BUT THOSE PARADES ARE
NOT FREE.

40
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,689
THAT IS OUR TAXPAYER MONEY GOING
TOWARD SOMETHING THAT MAKES

41
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,370
DONALD TRUMP FEEL GOOD ABOUT
HIMSELF.

42
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:23,879
BUT THIS IS GOLD BUILDINGS
GUY.

43
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,420
YOU THINK OF IT AS AN
UNNECESSARY EXPENSE, HE THINKS

44
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,859
OF IT AS SOMETHING HE HAS TO DO
FOR BRANDING FOR TEAM TRUMP.

45
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:37,260
AND IT IS WORTH IT FOR HIM.

46
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:44,419
BUT IT IS ABOUT ñ THIS IS MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?

47
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,419
RIGHT?

48
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,419
THIS

49
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:50,049
IS THE COMING HOME FROM THE WAR,
THE KIND OF THING THAT DONALD

50
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,620
TRUMP WOULD LATCH ONTO.

51
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,379
YOU READ THE PIECE OF HIS
STATEMENT ON IT ñ

52
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,579
I WANT US TO ALSO PLAY THE FULL
VERSION BECAUSE IT FEEDS

53
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,400
INTO WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS ARE.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,209
AND ALSO BRINGING UP ñ WHEN HE
PLAN TO BRING THOSE MILITARY

55
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,319
VEHICLES AND MEMBERS INTO HIS
INAUGURATION HE ASKED FOR

56
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,239
PICTURES FROM THE PENTAGON.

57
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,149
HE SAID CAN YOU GUYS SEND ME
PICTURES OF THINGS I CAN USE.

58
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:29,169
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE
VIDEO.

59
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:35,620
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF
FRANCE AND TRUMP.

60
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,750
I WAS YOUR GUESTS ñ IT WAS
ONE OF THE GREATEST PRAISE I HAD

61
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,680
EVER SEEN.

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,330
IT WAS TWO HOURS AND IT WAS
MILITARY MIGHT.

63
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,340
I THINK IT WAS A TREMENDOUS
THING FOR THE SPIRIT OF FRANCE.

64
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,400
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT GREAT
WARRIORS THEY ARE IN FRANCE.

65
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,810
TO SEE THAT IT WAS A TREMENDOUS
THING.

66
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,370
TO A LARGE EXTENT BECAUSE OF
WHAT I WITNESSED, WE MAY DO

67
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,740
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON JULY 4 IN
WASHINGTON DOWN PENNSYLVANIA

68
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,740
AVENUE.

69
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:16,069
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE TO
TURN A TOPIC, BUT WE HAVE A

70
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,823
LOT OF PLANES GOING OVER, A LOT
OF MILITARY MIGHT.

71
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,810
IT WAS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL THING
TO SEE.

72
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,150
WHEN I CAME BACK IN ONE OF MY
EARLY CALLS WERE ñ WE ARE

73
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,319
ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT FOURTH
OF JULY, PENNSYLVANIA

74
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,270
AVENUE HAVING A GREAT PARADE TO
SHOW OUR MILITARY STRENGTH.

75
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:42,659
ONE OF MY FIRST CALLS WHEN I
GOT BACK WAS TO PLAN A PARADE.

76
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:52,800
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH YOUR INAUGURATION NUMBER

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,370
ONE, OUR MILITARY
STRENGTH TO WHO?

78
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,719
IT IS ALL ABOUT SHOWING POWER.

79
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:07,610
OH, FRANCE DID IT, I WAS SO
IMPRESSED BECAUSE I AM A

80
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,610
10-YEAR-OLD.

81
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,860
AFTER WANTING TO DO IT, I HAVE
TO DO IT BETTER THAN YOU.

82
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,360
THE
ARROGANCE TO DO IT ON JULY 4

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,630
IN THE MIDDLE OF IMPEACHMENT
HEARINGS.

84
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,120
I LOVE PARADES THOUGH.

85
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,660
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A
BASKETBALL/FOOTBALL GAME

86
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
WITH A FLYOVER?

87
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,720
YEAH, IT IS COOL.

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:37,949
THE THREAT THAT WAS AWESOME
ABOUT ñ IT WAS LIKE AND I HAVE

89
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:38,949
TANKS?

90
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,020
A LOT OF TANKS ACTUALLY
DISPERSE THE PRESSURE A LOT MORE

91
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,099
THAN CARS DO SO IT IS LESS OF A
FOOTPRINT ON THE ACTUAL STREET.

92
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,639
CAN WE JUST GET HIM A G.I.

93
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:57,630
JOE KIT AND HAVE HIM DISTRACTED?

94
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,939
BUT YOU KNOW THEY WERE LIKE
LISTEN, WE KNOW WHAT YOU

95
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:04,439
WANT, WE WILL GIVE HIM A COUPLE
PLANES AND DO A FLYOVER AND

96
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,439
HE WILL BE HAPPY.

97
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,439
THAT

98
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:12,249
IS TRUE AND THAT IS HOW YOU FEEL
THEY APPEASE HIM CONSTANTLY.

99
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,360
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

100
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,370
U.S. PRESIDENTS ARE ALLOWED AND
REQUIRED TO PLAN THEIR OWN

101
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,669
FUNERALS.

102
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,169
PART OF WHAT THEY DO IS THEY
SIT DOWN EARLY IN THEIR

103
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:30,199
PRESIDENCY TO PLAN THEIR STATE
FUNERALS.

104
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,349
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HIS PLAN
IS?

105
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,150
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WILL
GO INTO THAT FUNERAL.

106
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,699
THE FLYOVERS AND THE MILITARY
AND THE MIGHT.

107
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:46,319
AND IF YOU ARE AT THE FUNERAL
YOU HAVE TO CRIME.

108
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,039
ALL THESE THINGS SOUND EXACTLY
LIKE THAT.

109
00:07:50,039 --> 00:08:05,870
IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH DICTATORIAL
REGIMES.

110
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,039
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

111
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,610
I THOUGHT OF THAT WHEN I HEARD
THE STORY.

112
00:08:14,610 --> 00:00:00,000
IT HAS TO STOP.
