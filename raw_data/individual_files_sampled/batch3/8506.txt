â™ª. GREG: WILL BE FINALLY SEE THE END OF THE PC. A NEW REPORT ON 80% OF THE PUBLISHING THE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS IS A PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY. AND IT'S A BELIEF FELT BY EVERYONE YOUNG, OLD, BLACK, WHITE, ASIAN, HISPANIC, NATIVE AMERICAN, ALL OF THEM THINK PC THOUGHT SUCKS. I CALL THAT UNITY. TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS FALL INTO THE EXHAUST MAJORITY WHO ARE TIRED OF THE POLARIZATION AND TIPTOEING AROUND THE EASILY OFFENDED. GET THIS. ONLY 8% OF AMERICANS ARE PROGRESSIVE ACTIVISTS. THE LEFT OF THE LEFT AND THE ONES WHO PUSH THE PC MEETING ON A PRESENT ARE TELLING US WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT SAY. THAT SEEMS LIKE TYRANNY. ANYWAY. PC CULTURE LIMITED SPEECH IN ANY WAY BUT I FOUND BOOKS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PUBLISHED THIS YEAR BUT BECAUSE OF THE PC CULTURE THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE PUBLISHED. HERE ARE A FEW OF THEM. I'M ANGRY ABOUT THIS. IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST BOOKS I FOUND RIGHT HERE. CALLED BODY SALLY, 1000 AIMS TO CALL GIRLS WITH FRECKLES. THIS IS TERRIBLE. THIS IS THE STUFF WE WILL LOSE. YOUR DAD LOOKS LIKE YOUR DAD'S BEST FRIEND. NO, SORRY, YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR DAD'S BEST FRIEND. 500 CLEVER SAYINGS FOR BIRTHDAY CLOUDS. TERRIBLE. THIS IS THE STUFF WE ARE MISSING. KIDS WHO DO CARTWHEELS ARE STUPID AND HAVE NO FRIENDS. ONE HUNDRED ASKED ABOUT CHILDHOOD NO ONE TOLD YOU BECAUSE YOU SMELL. IT BRINGS IT ALL HOME. THIS IS INTERESTING. YOUR BABY IS ACTUALLY REALLY UGLY. STOP BRINGING HIM TO LUNCH, DEBRA. THIS IS SPECIFIC. I'M TRYING TO GET MY UNLIMITED MIMOSAS ON 42995 AND I THINK A PRODUCER WROTE THAT FOR SOMEONE AT HOME. THIS BOOK IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY RYAN GOSLING. YEAH, TRUE. I FIND YOU GROSSLY UNATTRACTIVE. A LIST OF 10000 AMERICANS I FIND GROSSLY UNATTRACTIVE. SHALL WE STOP THERE? LET'S SEE. IF YOU LIVE AT HOME UNTIL YOU ARE 25 YOU'RE NOT A STRUGGLING MILLENNIAL, YOU ARE JUST A LOSE LOSER. I DID NOT SEE THAT ONE COMING. ALL RIGHT, KAT, I THINK THIS STUDY IS MUCH BIGGER THAN PEOPLE THINK BECAUSE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OVER 80% OF EACH ETHNICITY TO TEST PC CULTURE AND THIS COULD BE THE THING THAT YOU DIVIDE THE COUNTRY AND KILLS IDENTITY POLITICS. KAT: I HOPE SO AND I DO FIND THIS ENCOURAGING BUT I DON'T FIND IT TOTALLY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT JUST HOW POWERFUL THAT SMALL PC OBSESSED MOB IS. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SAY THAT SOMETHING ACCESSED OR SOMETHING IS RACIST AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THAT EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING TOTALLY RIDICULOUS LIKE HOOP EARRINGS BEING CULTURAL OPERATION OR ONE OF THE RIDICULOUS EXAMPLES EVER IN ABOUT A NATIONAL REVIEW IS PEOPLE HERE THAT IN THE MIGHT TO SAY OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO STAY AWAY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED A RACIST OR SEXIST TO HAVE POWER IN THOSE ACCUSATIONS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN THE MINORITY. WE NEED TO REMEMBER IF THE MINORITY AND FIGHT FOR THE ABILITY TO SPEAK LIKE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND ACT LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT. GREG: SO ATTACK THE MINORITIES IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. KAT, TERRIBLE. TO HER POINT, SHE IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEM WHICH IS THERE'S A TINY MOB THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LARGE MOB BECAUSE THEY'RE SO LOUD AND THEY COME AFTER PEOPLE LIKE YOU. WITH A GUEST ON YOUR SHOW, AND SHE SAID THE WORDS THAT ARE NOT FORGOTTEN. SHARE THE RISK. IF EVERY SINGLE PERSON SHARES THE RISK, THE LITTLE MOB GOES AWAY. IT'S WHEN WE ALL HIDE BECAUSE WE GO MAYBE THEY WILL NOT COME FOR ME SO THE CROCODILE WILL EAT YOU LAST THREE AND EVERYONE SAYS THEY'RE GOING AFTER KAT AND IF THEY GO AFTER KAT THEY WILL NOT GO AFTER ME. THEY GO FOR ONE AND GO FOR MORE. IF YOU STAND THERE AND THEY WILL STOP. THIS IS WHAT OUR FRIEND CALLS THE CHIHUAHUA ATTACK. THEY ARE A LITTLE YOU BEEN DOG THAT'S MAKING A LOT OF SOUND THAT YOU COULD TAKE THAT THING TO THE CORNER REALLY EASILY . GREG: IT'S ANOTHER SIZE ON THIS PANEL. RIDICULOUS. I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BECAUSE I SAID TO OUR. GREG: THAT WAS MY NICKNAME IN HIGH SCHOOL MAINLY BECAUSE I WAS HAIRLESS. TYRUS. TYRUS: THE PEOPLE THAT CONTROL IT IS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LARGE VOICE. EXAMPLE, WHEN WE HAD SITUATIONS LIKE AN OPINION, THIS WAS A SUMMIT ON A TV SHOW AND A CUSTOMER WANTS TO HEAR AND SOMEONE COMES ON TV IT SAYS I WAS OFFENDED AND I DON'T THINK OUR SPONSOR SHOULD AND THE CEOS WILL BAIL. GREG: HR NINE YEAH, THEY DON'T BECAUSE IT COULD BE A PROBLEM INSTEAD OF LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND ONE LEADING HEART CRYBABY ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT BUT THEY GIVE THAT POWER AND THEY DON'T TAKE IT. WE GIVE IT TO THEM. GREG: IT'S ALL TRUE AND POSTURING. JEDEDIAH, THE CORPORATE'S THAT WILL THROW YOU ASIDE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO THE PROBLEM OR BAD PR. PEOPLE STARTED YEARS AGO EMBRACING THE PC CULTURE BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE POLITE AND NICE TO KNOW EVERYONE IS UNITED BECAUSE THEY'RE TERRIFIED TO SPEAK. TERRIFIED TO SAY ANYTHING OUT OF FEAR THEY'LL BE LABELED SOMETHING AND IT'S UNITED PEOPLE IF YOU TWEET SOMETHING 25 YEARS LATER IT COULD COME BACK IN YOUR OUT OF A CAREER. GREG: YES, IT'S LIKE HERPES. NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW. DID YOU SEE THIS WEEK THAT THE ABC EXECUTIVES AND OTHER SAYING THEY MAY HAVE JUMPED THE GUN BY GETTING RID OF ROSANNE BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT CONNORS WILL DO POORLY. YOU GOT RID OF ROSANNE FROM THE ROSANNE SHOW AND. GREG: IT WILL BE REBOOT NUMBER THREE. ALL I KNOW IS WE MISSED OUT ON GREAT BOOKS. BECAUSE OF THIS PC CULTURE.
