1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,750
“My name is Andrew Bujalski.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,350
I’m the writer-director of
the movie "Support the Girls."

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,900
So, "Support the Girls"
is a movie that centers

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,960
on the character of Lisa,
played by the great Regina

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,079
Hall here, who is the general
manager of a highway-side,

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,370
as she calls it,
‘boobs, brews

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,840
and big screen" restaurant,
along the lines of Hooters.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,672
There are many,
many of them now

9
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,380
that have kind of
descended from Hooters.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,970
And throughout her
day in this movie,

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,380
she’s constantly having
to extinguish fires.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,690
Everything that could
go wrong is going wrong,

13
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,700
some of it of her own making.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,724
And you know part
of that’s managing

15
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:36,890
conflicts between the girls.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,162
And in this scene, a
conflict with a customer

17
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:42,370
bubbles up, which is something
that I think is always

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,453
kind of under the surface.

19
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:45,280
There’s always that
fear that a customer’s

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,321
going to get out of line.

21
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,697
And occasionally it happens.

22
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:51,280
And so here, one of
her girls has just

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,580
told her that a
customer basically

24
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,480
told her she was fat.

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,760
And Lisa’s not quite sure
what "basically" means.

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,990
But it doesn’t really matter.

27
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,670
She’s got to go to
bat for her girl.

28
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,040
So here she goes.

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,849
As she walks, of course,
she’s observing everything.

30
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,432
She sees another
potential situation

31
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:08,140
there — inappropriate
contact that she’ll

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,520
have to come back to.

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,980
But now she’s got to focus
on confronting this guy,

34
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,155
this biker gentleman — "

35
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,680
“Excuse me, sir." "Yeah."

36
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,560
"My name is Lisa,
I'm the general manager and

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,430
my girl just said you

38
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,290
got a little disrespectful with her."

39
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,880
And the actor here is a
guy named Pete Partida.

40
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,300
He’s a Texas actor.

41
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,370
And we saw a lot of
folks for this part, but

42
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,820
I was very excited about him
because he got at something

43
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,780
that I thought was important
for this character.

44
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,153
A lot of people
wanted, I think,

45
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:33,550
to play him as a kind
of raging villain.

46
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,230
And that wasn’t right for him.

47
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,470
I needed a guy who
felt genuinely wronged

48
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,370
in the situation, who’d
get across that sense

49
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,200
of aggrievement.

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,230
"I am done asking you nicely."
"You marching today?"

51
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,070
"Get your ass up, and
go eat somewhere else."

52
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,850
"I heard you the first time.
So now what are you gonna do?"

53
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,550
And Regina stood her
ground, as she had to.

54
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,300
And it all ends
pretty painfully.

55
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,550
But it’s Lisa’s job to
make everything right

56
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,810
in this place.

57
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,550
And so as he walks
out the door,

58
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,410
she’s being the
den mother again

59
00:02:02,410 --> 00:00:00,000
and trying to bring order back
to a chaotic restaurant."
