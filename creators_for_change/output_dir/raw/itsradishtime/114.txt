hi guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could not figure out how to</font>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,310
unlock a lock I just transferred to a

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,550
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle school and unlike my old tiny</font>

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,110
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> Catholic school where the lockers</font>

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">just opened this schools lockers had</font>

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,910
locks on them combination locks and I

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,340
had no idea how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them for two days</font>

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,710
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my locker door like slightly</font>

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,420
ajar just because I knew that if I

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,119
closed it I was screwed until somehow my

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,010
dad found out and then he drove me to

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,960
school after school hours and made me

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,410
just practice in tears opening and

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,719
closing the locker opening and closing

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,399
the locker 13 16 32 until I could get it

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,530
every time now when I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first</font>

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,989
office job everything was a combination

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock like figuring out how to do a mail</font>

19
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,390
merge was unsolvable so how the hell was

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,550
doing our entire organizations in a

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,710
report going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be solvable at one of my</font>

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,149
first staff meetings I was supposed to

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,579
present this timeline for all of our

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects and after i was done going</font>

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,330
through it my boss looks at me and goes

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so do you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walk us through</font>

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,600

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">i managed like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> half mumble I thought I</font>

29

<font color="#CCCCCC">just did but you do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over and</font>

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,159

strangers going to this giant event full

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,860
of people that I didn't know and the
