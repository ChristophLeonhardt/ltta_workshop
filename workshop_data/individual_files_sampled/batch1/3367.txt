pitbull is not a breed of dog it describes more about an opinion about what somebody has of what a dog looks like and that could be short coded it could be stocky build it could be lean and muscular it could be wide bodied it could be a wide head it varies from place to place our society has the idea that pit bull dogs are associated with dogfighting or that they have this mythology about being physically different or aggressive and so we assume that when dogs come to us with that label pitbull they're bringing that baggage behavior baggage with them and that that's really just not the case a dog's jaw cannot lock there is no morphological difference between a dog labeled pitbull and any other kind of dog their jaw structure is the same and there is no locking mechanism aggression is a dog trait and it doesn't happen often aggression isn't black or white either aggression can it happen on a large scale and what triggers a dog's reaction and the appearance of being aggressive is different from dog to dog we always assume the dog is uncomfortable when he growls but the dog does lots of things before he growls his ears might be pinned back his tail might be talked a wagging tail you have to look at the entire dog's body because up straight and wagging fast isn't really a good sign down low and wagging is a much nicer sign so you have to sort of look at the whole dog with your nose touch yes especially since we take dogs directly out of cruelty cases like fight busts or or neglect cases where the dogs come to us directly from that situation and what we do is we take that information that we know about the dog's past and we put it in our tool box but we don't lead with that information we look at each dog individually and get to know that dog and we find that a lot of dogs just need an opportunity to lead and show us who they are rather than us assuming that we know who they are based on their label
