when you bought the best players in the world gathered in one place for the biggest football tournament in the world they need something to play wish and here at the FIFA Museum on Navi our backs reef they've got swell a replica of the original football that was used back in ordered way in 1930 and all of the other balls probably one of the most iconic balls one of the most important ones the Mexico 1970 ball now that was the first one to employ and the that five-sided shape that you see on the side of the football the thing that would be probably most familiar to you and it comes to it also it's interesting what's related to this current tournament that board was called the Telstar the current ball also called the tell stuff and have a look at one of my favorite ones tell you ninety ball right there that was the ball I played with in the back garden it was before those things but this as it went on the ball that was used in the World Cup this became the something you had to have it became something you wanted to play with in part of the tournament sometimes famous sometimes infamous we're gonna come up to South Africa in 2010 Giuliani know this ball became quite infamous because a lot of goalkeepers complained about how it moved through the air when it was hit with power now I spoke to one of the greatest goalkeepers ever be well just how much of a factor the ball plays and whether sometimes it's used as a scapegoat how much of a factor does the ball actually have as a goalkeeper when you stood there and how much is it sometimes used as a you know a bit of any excuse well for the last put it never never use it as an excuse because you can see any replay you can see if the ball does move it moves a little bit but not as much as the ball from South Africa for instance if you remember how that ball when they were trying to pass the ball over 30 yards how it was sort of moving like that the poor design changed about 15-20 years ago because the FIFA wanted to have more goals they started to change the ball Nike does it obviously for the Premier League and many other leagues so the ball has over the years got a little bit later and it flies in a different way but it's not just about the footballs and the football players there's also a lot to do with the reminiscing about for the fans for people like myself and people like the man I'm joined with right now what's your name so where you from I'm the guy and I'm from Guatemala what do you think of this World Cup because this be the World Cup where somebody comes from nowhere and establishes themselves as one of the world players I hope so you know I like surprises in the past the first round you know hopefully it's a it's a different country when it the work up gonna give me who is the greatest of all time right now is it messy is it Ronaldo let's take care of yourself you
