1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,302
A LOT OF ROAD CLOSURES ARE IN 

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:02,602
THE WAY. 

3
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:06,840
DON'T RUSH TO THE SCENE. 

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,274
DON'T TRY TO GO IN THAT AREA. 

5
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,476
IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT SOMEONE 

6
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:14,381
AT A SCHOOL OR BUSINESS, DO IT 

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,983
VIA TELEPHONE OR SOCIAL MEDIA. 

8
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:17,917
DO NOT COMPLICATE THE ALREADY 

9
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,085
CHAOTIC AND ACTIVE AREA. 

10
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,754
>> THE HARTFORD COUNTY SHERIFF 

11
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,988
IS SAYING THAT THE SITUATION IS 

12
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:22,589
STILL VERY FLUID. 

13
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,889
WE DON'T HAVE ANY FOR 

14
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:27,560
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUSPECT 

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,564
OR THE SUSPECT MAY BE. 

16
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,233
YOU CAN SEE THIS SHOT FROM 

17
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:33,900
CHOPPER 13. 

18
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,235
WE ARE BEING TOLD THEY ARE ONLY 

19
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,536
ALLOWED TO GET SO CLOSE BECAUSE 

20
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:42,408
OF THAT AREA. 

21
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:43,510
THEY NEED TO KEEP THE SKIES 

22
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,444
CLEAR AS THEY CONTINUE TO 

23
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:44,777
INVESTIGATE. 

24
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,679
THAT SO THE POLICE CHOPPERS CAN 

25
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,381
GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. 

26
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,716
>> THERE ARE STILL TRYING TO 

27
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,950
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS 

28
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,388
POSSIBLE AND TRYING TO MAKE 

29
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,623
SURE THE VICTIMS IN THE CASE 

30
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,924
ARE IN THE HOSPITAL, CAN MAKE 

31
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:58,758
IT TO THE HOSPITAL. 

32
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,160
AGAIN, THIS IS A LIVE LOOK FROM 

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,493
CHOPPER 13. 

34
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,296
>> AS RICK MENTIONED EARLIER, 

35
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,763
AND MIKE, THIS IS NOT TOO FAR 

36
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:07,133
FROM THE LAST SCENE THAT WE 

37
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,637
COVERED. AS RICK MENTIONED, IT 

38
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,038
WAS A YEAR AGO WHEN THERE WERE 

39
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,840
THREE WORKERS WERE KILLED AT A 

40
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,474
FACILITY. 

41
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:20,380
RICK, JUST REFRESH IT FOR US. 

42
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,614
THERE WAS ANOTHER SHOOTING IN 

43
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,215
DELAWARE. 

44
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,251
THAT'S A CONCERN, OF COURSE, 

45
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,752
WHERE THE SUSPECT MAY BE TODAY. 

46
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:30,623
>> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.

47
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,758
I JUST SPOKE WITH AUTHORITIES 

48
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:36,629
LITERALLY ONE MINUTE TO GO. 

49
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,897
THE SUSPECT HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN 

50
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,330
INTO CUSTODY YET. 

51
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,134
IT IS STILL AN ACTIVE SEARCH. 

52
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,435
IS NOT AN ACTIVE SHOOTING 

53
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,369
SITUATION BUT THE SUSPECT HAS 

54
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,771
NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. 

55
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,872
THAT IS CERTAINLY A CONCERN. 

56
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,606
WHERE IS HE AT? 

57
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,242
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE INVOLVED? 

58
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,810
AS FAR AS THE MEDIA STAGING 

59
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,680
AREA GOES, IT IS VERY QUIET 

60
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,980
OVER HERE. 

61
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,150
ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO THERE WAS 

62
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,586
AN AMBULANCE THAT RACED BY. 

63
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,653
ACTUALLY TWEETED THAT OUT. 

64
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,957
ALSO UP HERE FROM THE BALTIMORE 

65
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,093
AREA ALONG 95, WE SAW SEVERAL 

66
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:11,798
UNMARKED POLICE CARS SPEEDING 

67
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,732
APPEAR TO HARFORD COUNTY. 

68
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,033
AND THEN THIS ROAD THAT IS 

69
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:14,968
CURRENTLY  BLOCKED AND CHOPPER 

70
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,369
13 WAS OVER THE AREA OR STILL 

71
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,606
IS OVER THAT AREA, WHICH IS 

72
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,506
WHERE THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE, 

73
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:24,477
WE SAW SEVERAL UNMARKED POLICE 

74
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,012
CARS TRYING TO GET INTO THAT 

75
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:26,412
AREA AS WELL. 

76
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,313
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO DO WHAT 

77
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,114
THEY CAN TO HELP. 

78
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,349
YOU BRING UP THE TWO PREVIOUS 

79
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:29,649
SHOOTINGS. 

80
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,050
OF COURSE THE ONE A COUPLE OF 

81
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,285
YEARS AGO AT PANERA BREAD WITH 

82
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:32,552
DEPUTIES. 

83
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,854
AND THEN THE ONE ALMOST A YEAR 

84
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,724
AGO THAT TOOK PLACE AT ADVANCED 

85
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,092
GRANITE SOLUTIONS. 

86
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,162
WHEN YOU GET HERE AND FOR ME TO 

87
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,496
BE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW, IT 

88
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,130
IS HARD NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE 

89
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,033
SHOOTINGS AND HARD TO BELIEVE 

90
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,434
THAT HERE WE ARE AGAIN, 

91
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,669
LITERALLY LESS THAN A YEAR 

92
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,941
LATER AND A POSSIBLE ANOTHER 

93
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,542
WORKPLACE SHOOTING. 

94
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,476
WE KNOW MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE 

95
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,545
SHOT AND WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET 

96
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,479
AN UPDATE AROUND 11:45 WITH 

97
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,880
MORE INFORMATION ON THIS 

98
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,348
TRAGEDY. 

99
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,549
AGAIN, THAT SUSPECT HAS NOT 

100
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,586
BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY YET. 

101
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,086
>> STANDBY. 

102
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,754
WE JUST WANT TO UPDATE PARENTS. 

103
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:11,991
CHART -- CHURCH CREEK 

104
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,394
ELEMENTARIES ON A MODIFIED 

105
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,962
LOCKDOWN. 

106
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,630
THIS IS A BUSINESS PARK. 

107
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,667
THERE ISN'T A SCHOOL IN THE 

108
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,167
IMMEDIATE FACILITY. 

109
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,768
BUT THEY ARE DOING THAT CHURCH 

110
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:26,306
CREEK OUT OF CAUTION. 

111
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,140
THAT IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST 

112
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,309
ONE IN PROXIMITY TO THE 

113
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:29,976
SHOOTING. 

114
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,844
RICK, THAT SUSPECT HAS NOT BEEN 

115
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:36,783
CAUGHT. SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE

116
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,484
HE OR SHE MAY BE AT THIS POINT. 

117
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,386
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THE 

118
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,389
POSSIBLE MEDIA BRIEFING? 

119
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,390
ARE THEY STILL GATHERING 

120
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,291
INFORMATION ON THE SUSPECT AND 

121
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,392
VICTIMS AS WELL? 

122
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,860
>> Reporter: I'M SORRY. 

123
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,062
I COULDN'T HEAR IF YOU'RE 

124
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,329
TALKING. 

125
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,329
WE ARE TRYING TO FIX THE 

126
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,097
BATTERY. 

127
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,900
THAT MEDIA BRIEFING IS SET FOR 

128
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,301
11:45. 

129
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,203
THEY SAID THE SUSPECT HAS NOT 

130
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,405
BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. 

131
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:06,746
THIS IS NOT STILL AN ACTIVE 

132
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,747
SHOOTER SITUATION BUT THE 

133
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,548
SEARCH FOR THE ALLEGED SHOOTER 

134
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:08,981
CONTINUES. 

135
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,650
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, YOU 

136
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:17,290
HAVE TO WONDER IF THIS IS ONE 

137
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,423
INDIVIDUAL, WAS THERE MULTIPLE 

138
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:18,824
PEOPLE INVOLVED? 

139
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:19,324
WE DON'T KNOW THAT. 

140
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,660
WE ARE EXPECTED TO GET AN 

141
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,861
UPDATE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. 

142
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,995
AS FAR AS THIS AREA, 

143
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:23,829
SPECIFICALLY THE MEDIA AREA 

144
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,866
STAGING AREA IS PRETTY QUIET. 

145
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,334
WE SAW ONE AMBULANCE RACE BIKE 

146
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,102
RECENTLY. 

147
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,204
WE KEEP REITERATING THE MASSIVE 

148
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,775
AMOUNT OF UNMARKED POLICE CARS 

149
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,809
THAT WERE RACING UP 95 TRYING 

150
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,810
TO GET TO THE SCENE. 

151
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,445
THERE ARE COUPLE OF HOMES BY 

152
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,081
HERE. 

153
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,116
OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 

154
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,317
STARTING TO CIRCLE IT OUT AND 

155
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,718
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS 

156
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,052
GOING ON. 

157
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,253
OF COURSE, THEY ARE WORRIED. 

158
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,090
IF KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL, -- A LOT 

159
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,060
OF CONCERN AND A LOT OF DETAILS 

160
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,696
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED. 

161
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,965
>> RICK, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

162
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,235
WE'LL KEEP COMING BACK TO YOU. 

163
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,470
KIMBERLY IS ON THE WAY ALSO. 

164
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,439
GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN JUST SENT 

165
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,040
OUT ANOTHER TWEET. 

166
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,510
IT IS INTERESTING, WE ARE 

167
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,344
GETTING SO MUCH INFORMATION AT 

168
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:11,844
ONE TIME. 

169
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,881
>> VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. 

170
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,181
>> YES. 

171
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:20,686
>> HE JUST TWEETED OUT THAT THE 

172
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:21,687
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS ON THE 

173
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:22,922
SCENE AND STANDING BY TO OFFER 

174
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,389
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. 

175
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,124
THE ATF IS ON THE SCENE AND THE 

176
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:25,658
FBI AS WELL. 

177
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,896
THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION, 

178
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,296
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN 

179
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,266
ABERDEEN. 

180
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,934
THEY SAY IT IS QUITE ODD THAT 

181
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,936
THEY BOTH HAPPENED SO CLOSE TO 

182
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:40,773
THE PROVING GROUNDS. 

183
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:45,545
THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION IS 

184
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,679
THEY ARE STILL LOOKING FOR THE 

185
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,079
SUSPECT. 

186
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,314
>> AND WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS 

187

POINT. 

188
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,249
>> WE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT 

189
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,350
AREA SCHOOLS BUT BECAUSE THIS 

190
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,319
IS A BUSINESS PARK, THE SCHOOLS 

191
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,723
ARE NOT VERY CLOSE TO THE 

192
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:56,989

193
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,257
IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN, 

194
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,894
CHURCH CREEK ELEMENTARY IS ON A 

195
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,528

196
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,762
THERE IS NO THREAT TO THE 

197
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,833
SCHOOL AT THIS POINT. 

198
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,034
THAT IS JUST OUT OF PERCUSSION. 

199
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,702
AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, 

200
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,906

WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SUSPECT 

204
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,413

00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,892
THERE ARE ONLY THREE WAYS IN

00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,826

212
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:34,827
EVERYTHING IS JAMMED TONIGHT 

213
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,028

THEY ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO AVOID 

219
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,073

00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,477
THIS IS NORTH OF ABERDEEN. 

221
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,578

00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,242
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN

00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,844
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF 

418
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,678
INJURIES TO THOSE VICTIMS. 

419
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,613

00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,255
TO SEE POLICE ARRIVE WITH 

424
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,991
FLASHING LIGHTS HERE AT THE 

425
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,592
SCENE. 

426
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,927
THIS IS STILL A FLUID AND OPEN 

427
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,627
INVESTIGATION RIGHT HERE. 

428
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,829
THEY HAVE LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES 

429
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,831
FROM AROUND THE AREA AND 

430
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,466
FEDERAL HELP IN THE FORM OF THE 

431
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:59,505

00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,940
WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE DETAILS 

433
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,740
ABOUT HOW THIS UNFOLDED, IF 

434
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,142
THEY KNOW ANY MOTIVE, THERE ARE 

435
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,813
A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO 

436
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,747
BE ANSWERED IN THIS. 

437
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,848
THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

438
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,849
THIS AREA IS SAFE. 

439
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,784
SO THEY GO METICULOUSLY THROUGH 

440
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,321
ANY BUILDINGS IF NEED BE TO 

441
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,555
MAKE SURE IT IS ALL CLEAR.

BUILDING. 

458
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,419
I'M LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW. 

459
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,489
IT SAID THIS FACILITY IS 

460
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,091

461
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,760
IT IS UNCLEAR WHERE THE 

462
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,193
SHOOTING HAPPENED. 

463
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:58,364
YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW ENORMOUS 

464
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,901
THIS FACILITY IS.

00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,102
AND WITH 1000 OR MORE EMPLOYEES 

466
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,704
HAVING TO BE TAKEN OUT, THIS IS 

467
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,140

BUNCHES -- SCHOOL BUSES. 

471
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,319
AS WE MENTIONED, WE BELIEVE 

472
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,553
THOSE WERE EVACUATING EMPLOYEES 

473
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,354
FROM THE BUILDING. 

474
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,525
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SHOOTING 

475
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,026

00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,775
TYPICALLY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE

00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,044
THIS HAPPENS, IF IT HAPPENS IN

00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,846

485
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,014

AS WE LOOK ACROSS THE SCENE, 

494
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,663

THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE

-- MEDIA STAGING AREA. 

556
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,462
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR POLICE 

557
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:18,697
TO MONITOR WHERE THE SUSPECT 

558
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,498

559
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,267

MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN 

578
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,304

579
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,075
THAT NEW INFORMATION COMING IN 

580
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:03,408

585
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,519
JUMPING BACK TO THE OTHER

00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,989
TRAGEDY A YEAR AGO TOOK PLACE 

587
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,193

THEY TOOK PLACE SO CLOSE. 

589
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,931
OBVIOUSLY, THAT WHEN TAKING

591
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,699

ONLY ABOUT 20 OR 30 EMPLOYEES 

593
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,569
WITH THAT. 

594
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:36,575
THIS IS A LOT MORE SCARY WHEN

596
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,510

00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,746
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE NOW BEEN 

599
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:40,979

600
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:41,947

>> THESE ARE CLEARLY EXPLOSIVE 

617
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,245
TIMES. 

618
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,980
WHAT RICK IS SAYING IS CORRECT, 

619
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,748
WE ARE SAYING THAT THIS 

620
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:21,887

THEY ARE SETTING AN OFFICIAL AS 

622
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:23,387
A SOURCE. 

623
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:24,723
IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO LIVES 

624
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,224
OR EXCUSE ME, WORKS IN THE 

625
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:30,696

WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDENTITIES. 

628
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:38,270
AP IS CITING AN OFFICIAL AS A 

629
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,871

00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,673
FATALITIES IN THAT'S MASS 

631
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,507
SHOOTING. 

632
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,244
CLEARLY IT IS EXTREMELY 

633
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,144
DISTRESSING FOR ANYONE WHO 

634
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:51,183
WORKS THERE, LIVES THERE, OR 

635
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,150
KNOW SOMEONE WHO WORKS THERE. 

636
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,251
>> WE ARE ALSO SEEING REPORTS 

637
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,586
THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THIS 

638
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,687
PERSON WAS CONNECTED BUT IT MAY 

639
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,922
HAVE BEEN A MAN OR WOMAN. 

640
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,523
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE 

641
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,626
SUSPECT WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR 

642
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,260
FROM POLICE. 

643
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,863
AGAIN, SOME OF THE VICTIMS HAVE 

644
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,464
BEEN TAKEN TO MARYLAND 

645
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,099
HOSPITALS AND SOME HAVE BEEN 

646
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,334
TAKEN UP TO DELAWARE BECAUSE OF 

647
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:21,580
THE CLOSE PROXIMITY TO DELAWARE.

648
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,914
THIS IS JUST SOUTH OF ABERDEEN. 

649
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,149
YOU'RE LOOKING LIVE AT THE 

650
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,950

WE ARE TOLD THERE ABOUT 1000 

654
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,457

THE BUILDING IS ABOUT 959,000 

656
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:39,097
SQUARE FEET. 

657
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,799

ONCE AGAIN, THE REPORTS THAT 

662
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,340

663
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,943
BEING CITED BY AN AP REPORTER 

664
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,778
WHO SAYS THEY GOT THAT 

665
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,146

TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. 

668
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,420
SO ALTHOUGH WE TRUST THE 

669
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,521
VALIDITY OF AN AP REPORTER WE 

670
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,256

00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,182
ARE THINKING THAT HARFORD 

740
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,285
COUNTY  SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS 

741
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,086

00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:57,362
GROUND, I'M WATCHING THE 

746
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,230
MEDEVAC CHOPPER JUST A FEW FEET 

747
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,101
IN FRONT OF ME AS IT GOES DOWN 

748
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:07,772
HERE JUST OFF OF SPESUTIA ROAD. 

749
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,407
THAT CHOPPER IS LANDING NOW 

750
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:13,878
HERE AT THE SCENE. WE DON'T 

751
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:16,848
KNOW HOW THIS SITUATION UNFOLDED

752
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,616
AND IF THERE ARE MORE VICTIMS 

753
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:21,987
INSIDE. 

754
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,757
WE DON'T KNOW IF MEDEVAC WOULD 

755
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,992
NEED TO TRANSPORT TO A TRAUMA 

756
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,293
CENTER BUT WE ARE WATCHING THAT 

757
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,228
CHOPPER LAND AT THIS ENTERPRISE 

758
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:35,033
BUSINESS PARK  RIGHT NOW. AND 

759
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,501
MOMENTS AGO, WE SOUGHT THEM 

760
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,870
EVACUATE THREE BUSLOADS OF 

761
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,639
PEOPLE BEFORE THE CHOPPER THAT 

762
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,540
CIRCLED AROUND IS NO LANDING 

763
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,309
HERE AT THE ENTERPRISE BUSINESS 

764
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:44,743
PARK.  

765
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,612
ACCORDING TO THE AP, MULTIPLE 

766
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,381
PEOPLE ARE DEAD AFTER A 

767
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,982
SHOOTING THAT UNFOLDED JUST 

768
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:55,086
AFTER 9:00 THIS MORNING. 

769
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,156
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT THERE 

770
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,592
HAS BEEN AN UPDATE FROM AP. 

771
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,627
WHEN WE SAY MULTIPLE THEY ARE 

772
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,896
NOW SAYING THREE PEOPLE ARE 

773
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,964
DEAD. 

774
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,566
THERE MAY BE MANY MORE INJURED. 

775
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,568
BUT ACCORDING TO THE AP, THERE 

776
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,236
HAVE BEEN DEATHS AND THREE ARE 

777
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,405
DEAD. 

778
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,106
THEY ARE NOT SAYING THE 

779
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,576
IDENTITIES OF THE PEOPLE OR IF 

780
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,312
A SUSPECT IS AMONG THEM. 

781
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,447
THIS EVENT HAPPENED OVER TWO 

782
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:22,847
HOURS AGO. 

783
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,948
THE FACT THAT A MEDEVAC HAS 

784
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:26,518
JUST LANDED MEANS EITHER THEY 

785
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,254
HAVE FOUND ANOTHER VICTIM IN 

786
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,922
THE SEARCH OR THERE HAS BEEN 

787
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,791
DRAMATIC ELEMENT WITHIN THE LAST

788
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,659
HOUR OR SO. 

789
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,830
BECAUSE IT JUST LANDED JUST 

790
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,230
NOW. 

791
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,501
>> WE ALSO KNOW THE SUSPECT IS 

792
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,202
NOT IN CUSTODY. 

793
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,170
WE ARE GETTING REPORTS ABOUT 

794
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,804
THAT SUSPECT BUT WE ARE WAITING 

795
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:48,373
FROM -- FOR PROBATION FROM 

796
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,709
POLICE. 

797
00:26:50,709 --> 00:27:01,753
-- CONFIRMATION FROM POLICE. 

798
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,590
SEVERAL AREAS NEARBY WERE 

799
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,226
VICTIMS COULD HAVE BEEN 

800
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:08,559
TRANSPORTED. 

801
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,296
AS DENISE MENTIONED, THREE HAVE 

802
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,530
BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD ACCORDING 

803
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,831
TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

804
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:18,036
HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE MORE 

805
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,204
VICTIMS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE 

806
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:19,804
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. 

807
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,939
AT THIS POINT, WE AREN'T 

808
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:21,639
GETTING MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT 

809
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,441
THE SUSPECT WE DON'T KNOW IF 

810
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:27,245
THAT SUSPECT WORKS AT THAT 

811
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:27,511
FACILITY. 

812
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:28,346
WE DO KNOW ABOUT 1000 PEOPLE 

813
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,281
ARE EMPLOYED AT THAT FACILITY. 

814
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,482
IT IS INCREDIBLY LARGE. 

815
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:34,452
DENISE, CHURCH CREEK ELEMENTARY 

816
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,689
IS ON A LOCKDOWN. 

817
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,190
THAT IS OUT OF CAUTION. 

818
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,696
THAT IS THE CLOSEST SCHOOL BUT 

819
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,063
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR

882
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,720
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SCARY 

883
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,020
SITUATION. 

884
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,688

MINUTES. 

893
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,406
I WAS TOLD THAT A SUSPECT HAS 

894
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,440
NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 

895
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,640

THERE ARE SOME REPORTS 

897
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,809
CIRCULATING THAT ARE SUGGESTING 

898
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:16,948
DIFFERENTLY. 

899
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,849
AUTHORITIES SAY RIGHT NOW THEY 

900
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,217
CANNOT SAY IF THAT SUSPECT WAS 

901
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:19,684

902
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,685

VERIFY. 

907
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,892
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF 

908
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:28,927
PANIC AND EMOTION IN THE 

909
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,061
COMMUNITY WHICH IS ENTIRELY 

910
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:31,896

00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:06,731
AS WELL AS STATE POLICE. 

924
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:07,866
THE GOVERNOR SENT STATE POLICE 

925
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,099
THERE. 

926
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,636
THIS IS A VERY MASSIVE LOCATION.

927
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,539
YOU HAVE AN ARMY OF LAW 

928
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,407
ENFORCEMENT THERE RIGHT NOW. 

929
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:21,145
I IMAGINE -- TAKE A LOOK, IT 

930
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:21,946
LOOKS LIKE NATIONAL GUARD IS 

931
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:22,179
THERE. 

932
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,181
YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS SEARCH 

933
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,782
GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR ANY 

934
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,316
VICTIMS AND OR A SUSPECT. 

935
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:29,854
>> WE ARE ALSO WAITING TO HEAR 

936
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,222
FROM ABERDEEN POLICE REGARDING 

937
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,025
THIS SHOOTING. 

938
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,159
THEY ARE WORKING ON A STAGING 

939
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,728
AREA FOR FAMILIES TO BE 

940
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,596
REUNITED. 

941
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,664
THAT INFORMATION IS 

942
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:39,997

NICOLE WHO WERE STANDING BY. 

947
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,938
SO MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION IS

00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,974
BEING FILTERED IN THROUGH 

949
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:50,541
SOCIAL MEDIA. 

950
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,009
THAT'S HOW THE POLICE AND THE 

951
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:57,181
ATF AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARE 

952
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,116

TWITTER. 

961
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,899
I'M HURT AND ANGRY THAT THIS 

962
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,000
KEEPS HAPPENING AND I'M AFRAID 

963
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,435
OF HOW CLOSE THEY ARE GETTING. 

964
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:23,708

965
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,709
WAKE-UP CALL MAKING ME EVEN

00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,309
MORE ANGRY. 

967
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:26,744
WE ALSO HAVE A TWEET FROM THE

PRAYERS ARE WITH THOSE IMPACTED 

972
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,516

WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS YET BUT I

ON THE EAST COAST. 

1003
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,521
THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST. 

1004
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,955
THEY HOUSE ALL SORTS OF

MEDICINES IN ALL DIFFERENT PARTS

1006
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,633
-- AS MIKE WAS EXPLAINING, THEY 

1007
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,567
HAVE TO COMB THROUGH EVERY 

1008
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:56,868

1009
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,902
LET'S GO BACK TO MIKE.

1028
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,641
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE THAT 

1029
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,975
IS NOT A POLICE VEHICLE THAT WE 

1030
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,344
KNOW THAT I'VE SEEN LEAVING THE 

1031
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:40,911

00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,226
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE 

1038
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,762
TRYING TO HELP OUT VICTIMS. 

1039
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,766
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CHAPTER 

1040
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,801

00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,635
WILL INTERNET ARE TO MONITOR 

1106
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,669
THE SITUATION HERE ON SPESUTIA 

1107
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,070
ROAD.  

1108
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,672
>> WE WERE LOOKING LIFE AT THE 

1109
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,476
STAGING AREA IN FRONT OF ONE OF 

1110
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,978
THE AREAS. 

1111
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,480
IT LOOKS AS IF LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1112
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,849
IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE VEHICLE. 

1113
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,018
THEY HAVE NO IDEA IF THERE ARE 

1114
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,086
EXPLOSIVES LEFT BEHIND. 

1115
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,087
WE DON'T KNOW, THE SUSPECT 

1116
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,856
COULD BE INSIDE. 

1117
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,057
IF THE SUSPECT IS INSIDE, WHICH 

1118
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:40,891
AREA OF WHICH BUILDING? 

1119
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,226
THAT'S WHY THERE IS THIS 

1120
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,461
ENORMOUS POLICE PRESENCE. 

1121
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:46,096
THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE 

1122
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:47,965
FACILITY. 

1123
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,201
THE FACILITY TAKES PEOPLE AT 

1124
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,336
EVERY ENTRANCE AND SCOURING 

1125
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,372
EVERY INCH. 

1126
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,607
AS OF 11:25, IT WAS STILL BE -- 

1127
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,742
BEING CALLED AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

1128
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:01,379
SCENE. 

1129
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,913
IF THERE IS A SUSPECT WHO HAS 

1130
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,582
BEEN ARRESTED, WE HAVE NOT BEEN 

1131
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,785
INFORMED. 

1132
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,586
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE RUMORS, 

1133
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,020
WE HAVE NO WAY OF SAYING IF 

1134
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,856
SOMEBODY IS IN CUSTODY. 

1135
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,091
AS WE LOOK AT IT, THAT'S 

1136
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,225
EXACTLY HOW IT APPEARS. 

1137
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:17,862
THE MIKE, WE ARE GOING TO STAY 

1138
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,229

1139
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:22,233
>> MIKE, WE ARE GOING TO STAY 

1140
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:22,867

1141
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,335
TELL US EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING 

1142
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:24,668
ON. 

1143
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,505
RESET THE SCENE IF YOU WILL. 

1144
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,341
>> Reporter: AT 9:06 THE FIRST 

1145
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,977
CALLS CAME IN FOR A SHOOTING 

1146

COUNTY ABOUT  10 MINUTES FROM 

1150
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,520
THAT SHOOTING LAST YEAR. 

1151
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,555
THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH DEALING 

1152
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,790
WITH THINGS LIKE THIS 

1153
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,724
UNFORTUNATELY. 

1154
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:47,692
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FIRST 

1155
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,126
REPORTED THERE WERE MULTIPLE 

1156
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,729
FATALITIES AND THEN PROVIDED 

1157
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:53,531

1158
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:59,003
PEOPLE DEAD CITING AN ANONYMOUS 

1159
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,804
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE. 

1160
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:00,705
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR 

1161
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,605
OFFICIAL WORD FROM THE HARFORD 

1162
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,740
COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE.  

1163
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,441
THEY ARE KEEPING PEOPLE BACK 

1164
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,909
FROM THE ACTUAL BUSINESS PARK. 

1165
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,277
HOWEVER, YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY 

1166
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,379
HAVE A LARGE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1167
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,547
PRESENCE HERE INCLUDING FEDERAL 

1168
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:13,184
AGENTS FROM THE ATF AND THE FBI 

1169
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,086
WHO ARE HERE INVESTIGATING. 

1170
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,189
JUST ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO, WE 

1171
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,590
SAW THE MEDEVAC TOUCHDOWN HERE. 

1172
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,525
THAT WAS AFTER THEY EVACUATED 

1173
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,094
SOME PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE ON 

1174
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:26,029
THREE SCHOOL BUSES AND THEN 

1175
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:31,235
MOMENTS AGO YOU SAW IT LIVE 

1176
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,803
HERE ON WJZ WHEN LAW 

1177
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,604
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAME HERE 

1178
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,705
INCLUDING A MILITARIZED 

1179
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:34,972
VEHICLE. 

1180
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:42,246
AND WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS, 

1181
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,647
THEY HAVE TO GO INCH BY INCH IN 

1182
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,082
THAT BUILDING AND MAKE SURE IT 

1183
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,417
IS CLEAR AND THAT THE THREAT IS 

1184
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:46,617
GONE. 

1185
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,018
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER 

1186
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:48,752
PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN INJURED. 

1187
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:50,554
THAT AP REPORT SAYS THREE DEBT 

1188
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,556
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF 

1189
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,861
-- DEAD BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE 

1190
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,164
EXTENT OF INJURIES. 

1191
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,600
HOWEVER, WE DID SEE THEM TAKE 

1192
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,369
AWAY A GRAY HONDA CIVIC THAT 

1193
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,938
HAD CRIME TAPE AROUND IT. 

1194
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:12,910
THAT WAS RIGHT BE FINE ME -- 

1195
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,780
RIGHT BEHIND ME. THEY TOOK THAT 

1196
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,616
AWAY ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. 

1197
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,051
WE ALSO HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE LAW 

1198
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,254
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES STILL 

1199
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,688
ARRIVING AT THE SCENE. 

1200
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,158
THAT MEDEVAC HAS NOT YET -- AS 

1201
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:31,595
FAR AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

1202
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,297
HEAR, WE DID NOT SEE THAT 

1203
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,100
MEDEVAC CHOPPER TAKE BACK OFF. 

1204
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,335
WE KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 

1205
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,637
ARE BEING TREATED AT TRAUMA 

1206
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,537
CENTERS IN THE AREA INCLUDING 

1207
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:43,173
AT JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW. 

1208
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:47,244
THEY ARE GOING TO HOLD A PRESS 

1209
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,680
CONFERENCE AROUND 12:30. 

1210
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,615
WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS 

1211
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:51,915
ABOUT THAT. 

1212
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:53,384
THERE ARE NUMBER OF TRAUMA 

1213
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,552
CENTERS IN THE AREA FROM 

1214
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,222
BALTIMORE TO DELAWARE. 

1215
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,523
WE ARE STILL WAITING ON A 

1216
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,293
NUMBER OF INJURED AND PERHAPS 

1217
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,494
SOME BASIC DETAILS ABOUT THE 

1218
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,363
SEVERITY OF THOSE INJURIES AND 

1219
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,399
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE -- SOME 

1220
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,634
PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO GET TO 

1221
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,769
WHERE THEY LIVE. 

1222
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,003
THEY ARE CONCERNED. 

1223
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:16,173
WE TALKED TO ONE WOMAN WHO SAID 

1224
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,509
HOW CHAOTIC IT WAS, IT SEEMED 

1225
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:37,328
LIKE ALL BROKE LOOSE -- LIKE ALL

1226
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:42,666
-- BROKE LOOSE. 

1227
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:48,572
ONE OF THE OFFICERS HAS A LARGE 

1228
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,274
WEAPON AND IS WALKING OUT OF 

1229
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,443
THE SCENE HERE, JUST ACROSS THE 

1230
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,946
STREET FROM THIS BUSINESS PARK. 

1231
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,715
WE ARE SEEING WHAT LOOKS LIKE A 

1232
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:02,219
LITTLE BIT MORE ACTIVITY AND 

1233
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,820
THE NUMBER OF AGENTS ARE ON THE 

1234
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,421
SCENE. 

1235
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,456
I WOULD SAY AT LEAST THREE 

1236
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,092
DOZEN ARE HERE. 

1237
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,462
AND THIS IS SPESUTIA ROAD , 

1238
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,163
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE 

1239
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:13,697
BUSINESS PARK. 

1240
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,732
THE HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S 

1241
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,268
OFFICE  IS HAVING A PRESS 

1242
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:18,969
CONFERENCE IN MINUTES. 

1243
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,106
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU. IT 

1244
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,107
DOES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE 

1245
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,775
BEGINNING TO CONVENE FOR SOME 

1246
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,477
SORT OF OFFICIAL NEWS CONFERENCE

1247
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:30,246
. SADLY, WE HAVE A NEW 

1248
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:30,748
VOCABULARY. 

1249
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,449
ONE OF THEM IS FLUID. 

1250
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:37,755
THE SITUATION IS FLUID. 

1251
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:38,555
THE SITUATION HERE IS FLUID. 

1252
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:39,890
PEOPLE LIVE IN THE VICINITY OF 

1253
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,791
THIS INDUSTRIAL PARK ARE BEING 

1254
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:44,028
URGED TO NOT COME IN THE AREA. 

1255
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,062
STAY OUT OF THE AREA. 

1256
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,064
I KNOW YOUR FIRST INSTINCT IF 

1257
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,466
YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO WORKS 

1258
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,001
THERE IS TO GO THERE BUT THE 

1259
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,104
BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE RIGHT 

1260
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,606
NOW TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND 

1261
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,042
TO CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO NEWS 

1262
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,211
SOURCES AND WAIT FOR WORD. WE 

1263
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,747
HOPE TO GET YOU THAT KIND OF 

1264
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,883
INFORMATION IN A FEW MOMENTS 

1265
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,352
WHEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A 

1266
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:08,752
NEWS CONFERENCE. 

1267
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,489
>> HARFORD COUNTY  SHERIFF ALSO 

1268
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,024
REMINDING YOU TO LISTEN TO THEM 

1269
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:18,896
FOR OFFICIAL INFORMATION. 

1270
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,298
WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHERE 

1271
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,902
THE LOCATION WILL BE. WE SAW 

1272
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:26,904
SEVERAL SCHOOL BUSES TAKING 

1273
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,774
EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE BUILDING. 

1274
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,875
THERE ARE AT LEAST 1000 

1275
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,010
EMPLOYEES THAT WORK AT THAT 

1276
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,277
FACILITY. 

1277
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,046
IT IS INCREDIBLY LARGE. 

1278
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,117
CHOPPER 13 IS OVERHEAD. 

1279
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,418
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET 

1280
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,419
CLOSE BECAUSE THOSE MEDEVAC 

1281
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,254
HELICOPTERS WERE STILL LANDING 

1282
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,288
AT THAT LOCATION. 

1283
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,726
MIKE ALSO MENTIONED THAT SOME 

1284
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,960
OF THE VICTIMS ARE BEING TAKEN 

1285
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,729
TO DELAWARE HOSPITALS, MARYLAND 

1286
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:55,866
HOSPITALS, AND THE BAYVIEW 

1287
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:59,103
LOCATION AS WELL AS -- 

1288
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,604
>> TRAUM CENTERS. 

1289
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,506
>> THE CLOSEST WOULD BE SHOCK 

1290
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,075
TRAUMA, OF COURSE. 

1291
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,711
CHRISTIANA ALSO HAS A GOOD 

1292
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,081
TRAUMA CENTER AS WELL. 

1293
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,516
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION 

1294
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,217
THAT IS STILL FLOATING AROUND 

1295
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:13,517
THERE. 

1296
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,050
ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE 

1297
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:14,317
SUSPECT. 

1298
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:19,390
WE DON'T WANT TO REPORT 

1299
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:19,890
INCORRECT INFORMATION. 

1300
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,325
IT IS UNCLEAR IF THAT SUSPECT 

1301
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,493
IS INFECTING CUSTODY. 

1302
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,528
THE SHOOTING SITUATION -- IN 

1303
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:29,198
FACT IN CUSTODY. THE SHOOTING 

1304
00:44:29,198 --> 00:44:33,303
SITUATION -- 

1305
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,139
>> I WOULD TRUST YOUR LOCAL 

1306
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:35,372
MEDIA. 

1307
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:39,977
A LOT OF NATIONAL REPEATED -- 

1308
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:44,481
MEDIA IS REPORTING INFORMATION 

1309
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,916
THAT IS NOT CORRECT. 

1310
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,485
THE BEST INFORMATION IS FROM 

1311
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,553
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

1312
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:50,854
THAT WILL BE THE REAL 

1313
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,822
INFORMATION. 

1314
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,524
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DO HAVE TO 

1315
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,958
SAY IT SEEMS TO BE CLEAR AT 

1316
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,259
THIS POINT THAT THERE ARE 

1317
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:57,494
FATALITIES. 

1318
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,129
THE NUMBER WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS 

1319
00:44:59,129 --> 00:44:59,396
THREE. 

1320
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,496
THERE WERE ALSO MULTIPLE 

1321
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:03,133
INJURIES. 

1322
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:06,403
>> DENISE, WE'VE BEEN TALKING 

1323
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,972
ABOUT THIS. 

1324
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:09,673
THIS SEEMS ODDLY FAMILIAR. 

1325
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:11,108
11 MONTHS AGO WE ALSO HAD THIS 

1326
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:15,679
VERY SIMILAR SHOT OVER EDGEWOOD.

1327
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,016
THAT WASN'T EVEN A YEAR AGO. 

1328
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,018
THAT WAS WHEN THREE EMPLOYEES 

1329
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,287
WERE SHOT AND THEN WENT UP 95 

1330
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,457
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER SHOOTING 

1331
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,357
IN DELAWARE AS WELL. 

1332
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:31,762
THERE WAS ALSO THE PENURY -- AN 

1333
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:32,730
ERA SHOOTING. 

1334
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,097
THIS ONE IS AT THE RITE AID 

1335
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:34,698
DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  

1336
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:35,833
SINCE MARCH, A SHOOTING AT 

1337
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,234
GREAT MILLS HIGH SCHOOL AND 

1338
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:41,371
ALSO THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. IT IS 

1339
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,175
DESERVING -- DISTURBING TO 

1340
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,277
COVER THESE. 

1341
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,478
THE MEDEVAC HELICOPTER IS NOW 

1342
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:50,814
LEAVING. 

1343
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,482
WHERE IT IS HEADING, IS UNCLEAR 

1344
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:53,550
TO US. 

1345
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,185
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THAT 

1346
00:45:55,185 --> 00:46:04,127
INFORMATION. 

1347
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:04,728
THE PRESS CONFERENCE WAS 

1348
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:05,729
SUPPOSED TO START TWO MINUTES 

1349
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,197
AGO BUT WE KNOW HOW THAT GOES. 

1350
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,198
>> WE ARE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS 

1351
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,333
BUT I'M MAKING THE ASSUMPTION 

1352
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,667
IF THE MEDEVAC JUST LANDED IN 

1353
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,269
IS TAKING OFF NOW TWO AND HALF 

1354
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,337
HOURS AFTER THE EVENT INITIALLY 

1355
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,271
TOOK PLACE EITHER THEY ARE 

1356
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,105
DISCOVERING MORE PEOPLE WHO 

1357
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,106
WERE INJURED OR SOMETHING HAS 

1358
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,474
DEVELOPED, SOMETHING DRAMATIC 

1359
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:17,841
HAS DEVELOPED. 

1360
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,777
>> DENISE, WE ARE GETTING THIS 

1361
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:24,247
TOO FROM THE RITE AID. SUSAN 

1362
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:27,417
HENDERSON IS WITH WRITING. 

1363
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,319
SHE SAYS THIS HAPPENED AT THE 

1364
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:35,592
SUPPORT -- RITE AID. 

1365
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,361
SHE SAYS THIS IS HAPPENED AT 

1366
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:43,066
THE SUPPORT CENTER. 

1367
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,367
EXPORT -- A SUPPORT FACILITY 

1368
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:47,771
ADJACENT TO A LARGER BUILDING. 

1369
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:48,906
THAT IS QUITE BIG. 

1370
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,640
>> INITIALLY, THE WORD WENT OUT 

1371
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,878
THAT IT WAS A WORKPLACE 

1372
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:55,145
SHOOTING. 

1373
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,480
THAT CAN MEAN ANYTHING. 

1374
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,754
A CODE BECASE -- IT COULD BE A 

1375
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,055
ROBBERY, IT COULD BE A DISPUTE. 

1376
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,089
WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 

1377
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,090
THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS 

1378
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,492
WHO ARE THESE VICTIMS SO THAT 

1379
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:14,231
FAMILIES CAN REST EASY. 

1380
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:14,965
WHO IS JUST FINE? 

1381
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,266
WHO HAS BEEN EVACUATED AND IS 

1382
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:16,667
JUST FINE? 

1383
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,667
THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT 

1384
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:19,903
QUESTIONS WE HOPE TO GET 

1385
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,072
ANSWERS TO IN THE NEXT 10 TO 15 

1386
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,240
MINUTES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1387
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,042
WHO SAID THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 

1388
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:31,748
A NEWS CONFERENCE AT 11:45. 

1389
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,084
>> ONE OF THE THINGS TOO, WE 

1390
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,554
HEARD FROM NICOLE IF YOU 

1391
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,588
MINUTES AGO SING PEOPLE WERE 

1392
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:39,589
CHECKING IN ON FACEBOOK SAYING 

1393
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:44,261
THEY ARE OKAY. 

1394
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,497
WE ARE BEING TOLD IT IS STILL 

1395
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,165
ON LOCKDOWN. 

1396
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,701
PARTS ARE STILL BEING HELD ON 

1397
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,902
LOCKDOWN AS EMPLOYEES ARE BEING 

1398
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:52,436
TAKEN OUT. 

1399
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,839
HE WORKS THERE FOR -- A DECADE 

1400
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,275
AND KNOWS SOME OF THE PEOPLE. 

1401
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,510
PEOPLE ARE STILL CHECKING IN TO 

1402
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,479
LET LOVED ONES KNOW THEY ARE 

1403
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,347
OKAY. 

1404
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,915
WE STILL DON'T HAVE WORD ON 

1405
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,783
THAT FAMILY REUNIFICATION 

1406
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,118
CENTER. 

1407
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,887
WE ARE TOLD WITHIN THE NEXT 

1408
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:10,954
FIVE MINUTES THAT MEDIA 

1409
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,657
BRIEFING WILL BE UNDERWAY. 

1410
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:18,762
RICK RITTER IS STANDING BY. 

1411
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:19,629
THIS HAS BECOME TOO FAMILIAR 

1412
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:20,998
FOR THEM COVERING THESE 

1413
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,299
WORKPLACE SHOOTINGS. 

1414
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,335
DENISE, A GOOD POINT, SOMETIMES 

1415
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,471
THESE ARE DOMESTIC SITUATIONS. 

1416
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,506
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT OCCURS AT 

1417
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,974
A WORKPLACE. 

1418
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,845
IN OTHER SITUATIONS IT IS A 

1419
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,480
DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE AS WE ARE 

1420
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:36,713
AWARE. 

1421
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:39,249
>> ANYTHING, ANYTHING, THIS CAN 

1422
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,118
BE ANYTHING. 

1423
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,252
IT'S A DRUG DISTRIBUTION 

1424
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:42,552
CENTER. 

1425
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,121
COULD HAVE BEEN A ROBBERY. 

1426
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,989
WE LITERALLY KNOW NOTHING THAT 

1427
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:51,495
WE COULD GIVE YOU. 

1428
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:54,765
NO INFORMATION THAT IS 

1429
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,699
VERIFIABLE EXCEPT FOR SETTLING 

1430
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,600
THREE PEOPLE OF LOST THEIR 

1431
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,936
LIVES THIS MORNING. 

1432
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,337
THAT IS NOT INCLUDING A SUSPECT 

1433
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,638
IS WHAT WE ARE TOLD. 

1434
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,373
THOSE ARE THREE VICTIMS. 

1435
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,243
>> LET'S GO BACK TO MIKE NOW 

1436
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,146
WITH MORE. 

1437
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,547
MIKE, THAT HELICOPTER HAS TAKEN 

1438
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,016
OFF AGAIN. 

1439
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,351
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS BEHIND 

1440
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:14,584
YOU? 

1441
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,819
>> Reporter: IT DID. 

1442
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,087
IT DID. 

1443
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,721
LITERALLY LIKE A MINUTES AGO IT 

1444
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:20,957
WENT UP OVER THOSE TREES AND 

1445
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:21,958
FLEW OVER THAT WAY. 

1446
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,028
IT FIRST LANDED HERE ROUGHLY 10 

1447
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:29,433
TO 15 MINUTES AGO. 

1448
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:33,870
THERE WERE SEVERAL EMPTY 

1449
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,572
HARFORD COUNTY  SCHOOL BUSES 

1450
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:40,043
THAT WERE BROUGHT IN AND ABOUT 

1451
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,445
A HALF HOUR LATER, WE SAW THOSE 

1452
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,579
BUSES FILLED WITH PEOPLE 

1453
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,947
LEAVING THE BUSINESS PARK WITH 

1454
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:47,084
A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1455
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,151
MEMBERS. 

1456
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,454
THEN WE SAW THE MEDEVAC CHOPPER 

1457
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,157
LAND HERE AT A LARGE BUILDING 

1458
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,194
RIGHT HERE AT THE BUSINESS PARK,

1459
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,062
THOMAS ACROSS THE STREET FROM 

1460
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,063
WHERE I AM. 

1461
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,632
AND THEN IT WAS PROBABLY 10 -- 

1462
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,301
THERE WAS A MILITARIZED VEHICLE 

1463
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,837
AND A LARGE LINE OF LAW 

1464
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,438
ENFORCEMENT THAT CAME IN TO THE 

1465
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,842
BUSINESS PARK, TO THE SCENE, 

1466
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,209
AND THEN WE SAW THAT MEDEVAC 

1467
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,377
CHOPPER TAKE OFF. 

1468
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:16,279
NOW WE ARE SEEING A NUMBER OF 

1469
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,081
LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES LEAVING

1470
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:21,485
AFTER THAT CHOPPER TOOK OFF. 

1471
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:25,122
AND AS WE MENTIONED FROM THE 

1472
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,056
ASSOCIATED PRESS, WE HEARD FROM 

1473
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,192
A RITE AID SPOKESPERSON THAT 

1474
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,628
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED AT A 

1475
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:35,165
SUPPORT FACILITY ADJACENT TO A 

1476
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,067
LARGER BUILDING HERE. 

1477
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,970
A SUPPORT FACILITY ADJACENT TO 

1478
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,538
A LARGER BUILDING HERE AT THE 

1479
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:41,771
SCENE. 

1480
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:43,406
SO, WE ARE THINKING THAT 

1481
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:45,709
PERHAPS THERE WERE STILL SOME 

1482
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,078
INJURED IN THERE AND SO THEY 

1483
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,514
WANTED TO CLEAR OUT AS MANY 

1484
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:51,848
CIVILIANS AS THEY COULD AND 

1485
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,683
BROUGHT IN THAT MEDEVAC CHOPPER 

1486
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,419
AND BROUGHT IN MORE LAW 

1487
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:57,787
ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AND THAT 

1488
00:50:57,787 --> 00:51:01,892
THAT CHOPPER LEFT THE SCENE. 

1489
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,126
AS WE WERE TELLING YOU EARLIER, 

1490
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,895
HERE IN HARFORD COUNTY  THEY 

1491
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,796
HAVE TRAINED PARAMEDICS TO COME 

1492
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:08,398
IN AND DEAL WITH THESE MASS 

1493
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:13,770
SHOOTINGS SO THAT IT CAN BE A 

1494
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,738
DANGEROUS, ACTIVE, FLUID 

1495
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,105
SITUATION. 

1496
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,575
THEY HAVE TRAINED THEM TO BE 

1497
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,976
ABLE TO WORK AROUND THAT AND BE 

1498
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,211
ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN LIVES 

1499
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,948
WHILE TRYING TO SAVE PEOPLE. 

1500
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:25,882
SO THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T BLEED 

1501
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:30,487
TO DEATH OR DOESN'T GET -- 

1502
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:31,655
ISN'T STUCK WHILE THEY'RE 

1503
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,291
WAITING FOR PLEASE TO CLEAR THE 

1504
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,058
BUILDING. 

1505
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,394
SOMETIMES -- POLICE TO CLEAR 

1506
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,261
THE BUILDING. 

1507
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,497
SOMETIMES THEY WILL BRING IN 

1508
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,633
RESPONDERS TO VICTIMS IN SAFE 

1509
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:48,405
LOCATIONS. 

1510
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,040
AND THAT HAS SAVED LIVES. 

1511
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,176
WE SAW THEY DID THAT IN THE 

1512
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,444
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED LAST 

1513
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:58,982
YEAR WITH THE MAN WHO WENT ON 

1514
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,818
THE RUN AND DROVE TO DELAWARE 

1515
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,553
AND SHOT SOMEONE THERE. 

1516
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,622
HE IS STILL GOING ON TRIAL. 

1517
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,292
HIS TRIAL IN DELAWARE IS OVER. 

1518
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:16,266
THEY ALREADY HAD THAT TRAINING. 

1519
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,001
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE WELL 

1520
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,069
VERSED IN THAT. 

1521
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,638
AGAIN, THAT CHOPPER JUST LEFT 

1522
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,339
HERE. 

1523
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,574
WE KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE 

1524
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,543
INJURED AS WELL WHO WERE TAKEN 

1525
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:31,381
TO CHRISTIANA AND JOHNS HOPKINS 

1526
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,482
BAYVIEW AND WE'RE EXPECTING TO 

1527
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,916
HEAR MORE FROM BAYVIEW LATER ON 

1528
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:35,518
TODAY. 

1529
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,587
>> A QUICK QUESTION. 

1530
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,323
ARE YOU HEARING ANYTHING? 

1531
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,525
WE ARE GETTING WORD THAT THEY 

1532
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,693
ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO TO -- 

1533
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,596
GRACE. BUT I'M TRYING TO GET 

1534
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:51,401
CONFIRMATION ON THAT. 

1535
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,570
>> Reporter: THAT MAY BE TRUE. 

1536
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:57,174
HOWEVER, THE HARFORD COUNTY 

1537
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,074
SHERIFF'S OFFICE JUST SAID THEY 

1538
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,509
WERE A FEW MINUTES DELAYED  BUT 

1539
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,378
THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE 

1540
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:01,845
BRIEFING UNDERWAY. 

1541
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,580
I'M THINKING THEY WILL PROVIDE 

1542
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:09,986
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. 

1543
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,655
ALL WE KNOW FROM THE SCENE 

1544
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,557
RIGHT HERE IS THAT THEY 

1545
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,424
EVACUATED PEOPLE OUT. THEY 

1546
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,326
BROUGHT THE MEDEVAC IN AND THEY 

1547
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,693
HAVE A LARGE POLICE PRESENCE 

1548
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:18,828
HERE. 

1549
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,497
THERE ARE A LOT OF ATF AGENTS 

1550
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:25,435
WHO ARE ARMED WITH VESTS. 

1551
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,070
WE SAW ACTIVITY JUST A FEW 

1552
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,207
MOMENTS AGO. 

1553
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,475
AND WE STILL SEE A NUMBER OF 

1554
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,443
POLICE OFFICERS STANDING BY 

1555
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:36,980
HERE ON SPESUTIA ROAD . AND 

1556
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,514
FROM WHAT THE RITE AID IS 

1557
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:40,116
SAYING, THE SHOOTING HAPPENED 

1558
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,719
AT A SUPPORT FACILITY THAT IS 

1559
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,021
NEXT TO A LARGER BUILDING. 

1560
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,656
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH HERE 

1561
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,693
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY COVER 

1562
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,729
EVERY SQUARE FOOT OF THIS SO 

1563
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,931
THAT IF THERE IS ANY RISK OR 

1564
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:59,602
DANGER HERE, THAT THIS IS SAFE 

1565
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:01,471
FOR PEOPLE. 

1566
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,075
SO THIS IS STILL A DEVELOPING 

1567
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,478
SITUATION HERE. POLICE HAVE NOT 

1568
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,213
STOOD DOWN YET. 

1569
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,514
YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE PICTURES 

1570
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,982
JUST HOW MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1571
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:18,121
OFFICERS ARE HERE. THE NUMBER 

1572
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,022
HAS JUST KEPT GROWING SINCE 

1573
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:22,192
THIS WAS FIRST REPORTED A FEW 

1574
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,761
MINUTES AFTER 9:00 THIS MORNING.

1575
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:29,332
>> IT'S IRONIC IN A TERRIBLE 

1576
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:30,333
WAY THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN 

1577
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,169
AGAIN IN HARFORD COUNTY.  

1578
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,271
GENERALLY HARFORD COUNTY IS A 

1579
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,173
SAFE COUNTY.  

1580
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:42,912
THEY LOST 2:A BEAST -- LOST TWO 

1581
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,514
DEPUTIES. 

1582
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,183
THAT WAS THE FIRST DEPUTIES 

1583
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,386
THEY HAD LOST IN DECADES. 

1584
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,419
THESE SHOOTINGS CONTINUE TO 

1585
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:52,455
HAPPEN. 

1586
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,624
>> IT WAS JUST 11 MONTHS AGO 

1587
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,592
THAT HE SHOT -- 

1588
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,727
>> IT WAS OCTOBER. 

1589
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:58,728
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU 

1590
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,997
SAY THAT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IS 

1591
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,232
FOLLOWING THIS AS WELL. 

1592
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,666
THEY JUST LOST THEIR OWN 

1593
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,601
EMPLOYEES IN A WORKPLACE 

1594
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:09,406
SHOOTING. THIS IS HAPPENED 

1595
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:14,978
THREE TIMES HERE IN MARYLAND. 

1596
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,313
THIS IS THE THIRD ONE SINCE 

1597
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:16,613
MARCH. 

1598
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:17,747
WE HAD GREAT MILLS HIGH SCHOOL, 

1599
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:18,748

1603
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,594
IT IS DCC VU UP HERE. 

1604
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,596
A SUSPECT, CASUALTIES, PEOPLE 

1605
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:38,168
BEING TAKEN TO HOSPITALS, IT'S 

1606
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,002
SO DISTURBING TO CONTINUE 

1607
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,769
FOLLOWING THIS. 

1608
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,937
>> YES. 

1609
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:44,240
IT'S DISTURBING. 

1610
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,674
KIMBERLY HAS ARRIVED AT THE 

1611
00:55:45,674 --> 00:55:46,676

HOURS AGO. 

1614
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:50,946
HE SAW THE RESPONSE AT THE 

1615
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:51,848
SCENE. 

1616
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,183
WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED NOW AND 

1617
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,019
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN? 

1618
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,687
>> Reporter: WE ARE PUSHED BACK 

1619
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,655
FROM THE SCENE. 

1620
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,790
WE ARE ON OLD PHILADELPHIA ROAN.

1621
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,125
WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PRESS 

1622
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,893
CONFERENCE TO BEGIN. 

1623
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,596

1624
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,630
WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PRESS 

1625
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,264
CONFERENCE TO BEGIN. 

1626
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,300
WE ARE WAITING ON A PRESS

NOW. 

1629
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,139
THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE FIRST 

1630
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,575
OF MANY PRESS CONFERENCES TODAY.

1631
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,943
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GENERALLY 

1632
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,811
GOOD ABOUT GIVING US ANY 

1633
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,079
INFORMATION THEY CAN WHEN THEY 

1634
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,581
CAN. 

1635
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,049
WE EXPECT THAT THESE 

1636
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,718
CONFERENCES COULD BE STAGGERED 

1637
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,054
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS THE

00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:31,788
SITUATION UNFOLDS. 

1639
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:32,989
YOU KEEP REFERRING TO THIS AS A 

1640
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:33,389
FLUID SITUATION. 

1641
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:36,726
IT IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

1642
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,796
SITUATION. 

1643
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,364

01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:56,906
FATALITIES. 

1826
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:57,907
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT 

1827
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,175
NOW, AND AGAIN THIS IS 

1828
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,243
PRELIMINARY, THE LOAN SUSPECT 

1829
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,944
IS IN CUSTODY AND IS IN 

1830
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,213
CRITICAL CONDITION AT A LOCAL 

1831
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:04,480
HOSPITAL. 

1832
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,282
IT APPEARS TO BE A SINGLE 

1833
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,618
WEAPON THAT WAS USED, A HANDGUN

1834
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,386
. THERE WERE NO SHOTS FIRED BY 

1835
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,356
ANY OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1836
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:13,823
OFFICERS RESPONDING. 

1837
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,292
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS AN 

1838
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,426
ADDITIONAL THREAT ANYWHERE TO 

1839
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,496
THE HARFORD COUNTY COMMUNITY.  

1840
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,398
WE HAVE SET UP A FAMILY 

1841
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,935
REUNIFICATION CENTER. 

1842
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,605
AGAIN, THIS IS VERY EARLY. 

1843
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,041
THE OFFICE WILL BE HAPPY TO GIVE

1844
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,075

01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,988
WE ALSO HAVE TO THANK FELLOW

FIRST RESPONDERS. 

1850
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,257
WE HAVE RESPONDERS FROM THE 

1851
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,526
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 

1852
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,963
THE FBI, ATF, STATE POLICE, 

1853
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,865

01:03:55,865 --> 01:04:01,070
DEPARTMENTS, YOU NAME IT, AS WE 

1855
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,637
HAVE SEEN IN THE COMMUNITY 

1856
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:04,140
BEFORE, WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 

1857
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,808
THIS HAPPENS, YOU CAN'T HAVE 

1858
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:08,244
ENOUGH POLICE AND YOU CAN'T 

1859
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,512
HAVE THEM FAST ENOUGH. 

1860
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,946
WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT EVERYBODY 

1861
01:04:10,946 --> 01:04:15,718
WORKS SO WELL TOGETHER. 

1862
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,253
WE WERE ON SCENE AND ABLE TO 

1863
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:18,554
GET AS MUCH AID AS QUICKLY AS 

1864
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:18,821
POSSIBLE. 

1865
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:19,989
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE AT THIS 

1866
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:20,389
POINT. 

1867
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,158
KRISTI WILL PUT IT OUT LATER 

1868
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,059
WHEN WE HAVE ADDITIONAL 

1869
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:24,359

1870
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:25,761
I KNOW YOU ARE ANXIOUS. 

1871
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,664
WE WILL BE AS TIMELY AS WE CAN. 

1872
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,634
SERVE. 

1873
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:37,006
-- SIR. 

1874
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:42,945

1875
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,247
OFF THE PHONE WITH THE GOVERNOR 

1876
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:45,615
A FEW MOMENTS AGO. 

1877
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,117
I UPDATED THE GOVERNOR ON THE 

1878
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,986
INCIDENT SO FAR AS WE KNOW IT. 

1879
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,588
HE OFFERED ALL OF HIS RESOURCES 

1880
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:53,088
AVAILABLE UNDER STATE 

1881
01:04:53,088 --> 01:04:53,856
GOVERNMENT. 

1882
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,559
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. 

1883
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,793
ALL THE ALLIED AGENCIES THAT 

1884
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:02,064
RESPONDED -- I FOLLOWED THIS 

1885
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,933
FROM THE MOMENT THE CALL CAME 

1886
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,136
ON THE DISPATCH AND LISTENED TO 

1887
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,938
THE RADIO TRANSMISSIONS. 

1888
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,373
UNFORTUNATELY, TODAY WE HAVE

01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,074
ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLING AND

01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,477

AND THE RESPONSE FROM ALL THE 

1895
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,924

1900
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,467
WHICH IS BECOMING A TOO OFTEN 

1901
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:42,138
OCCURRENCE NOT ONLY IN HARFORD 

1902
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,373
COUNTY BUT IN THE COUNTRY.  

1903
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,941
WE REALLY REACH OUT TO THOSE 

1904
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:48,143
FAMILIES THAT ARE SUFFERING 

1905
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:49,478

01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,121
WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1911
01:05:59,121 --> 01:05:59,956
DISPLACED. 

1912
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,757
I CERTAINLY THINK ALL OF THE 

1913
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:05,594
COURAGEOUS -- THANK ALL OF THE

>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE 

1917
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,267
SUSPECT SHOT IS -- HIS OR 

1918
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,334
HERSELF? 

1919
01:06:12,334 --> 01:06:14,303
>> WE ARE NOT GIVING ADDITIONAL 

1920
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,572
INFORMATION. 

1921
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,573
THIS IS VERY FLUID. 

1922
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,075
WE WILL PROVIDE YOU THE 

1923
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,043
INFORMATION AS SOON AS WE HAVE 

1924
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:21,243
IT. 

1925
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:21,844
FOLLOW THE FEEDS. 

1926
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,479
I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN THE 

1927
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:29,485
NEXT BRIEFING WILL BE TODAY. 

1928
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,619
THANK YOU. 

1929
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:33,422
>> THANK YOU. 

1930
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:42,298
>> SO WE HAVE THE LATEST 

1931
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,199
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHOOTING. 

1932
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:43,933
IT STARTED ABOUT 9:00 THIS 

1933
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:44,199
MORNING. 

1934
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,468
WE KNOW NOW THAT THE OFFICERS 

1935
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,902
SAY IT HAPPENED AT THE RITE AID 

1936
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:47,870
DISTRIBUTION CENTER  IN THIS 

1937
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:51,907
INDUSTRIAL PARK AREA. OFFICERS 

1938
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:53,342
WERE CALLED AND GOT TO THE 

1939
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:53,942
SCENE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. 

1940
01:06:53,942 --> 01:06:55,111
IMMEDIATELY THEY STARTED 

1941
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,612
WORKING ON PEOPLE THAT THEY 

1942
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,013
SOUGHT THAT WERE WOUNDED. 

1943
01:06:58,013 --> 01:07:01,450
THE REPORTING IS THAT THIS 

1944
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,618
PRESS CONFERENCE HAS NOT 

1945
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,854
CONFIRMED IT BUT THREE PEOPLE 

1946
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:05,821
WERE KILLED. 

1947
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:10,292
MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED 

1948
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,627
AND THE SUSPECT IS IN CRITICAL 

1949
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,428
CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL. 

1950
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,462
WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT NO 

1951
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,698
OFFICERS FIRED THEIR GUNS. SO 

1952
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,566
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE SUSPECT IS 

1953
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:21,170
IN MEDICAL CONDITION BECAUSE HE 

1954
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:26,442
OR SHE SHOT THEM SELF OR IF 

1955
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,977
SOMEONE ELSE HAD A GUN ON THE 

1956
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:28,277
SCENE. 

1957
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,512
ALL THEY ARE WILLING TO SAY IS 

1958
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:30,913
THAT NO OFFICERS SHOT BUT THE 

1959
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:31,513
SUSPECT IS IN CRITICAL 

1960
01:07:31,513 --> 01:07:32,847
CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL. 

1961
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:36,418
>> PAUL IS WITH THE SNOW AND 

1962
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:37,219
JOINS US ON THE PHONE. 

1963
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,821
PAUL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I 

1964
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:39,655
THINK IS INTERESTING TO 

1965
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,056
UNDERSTAND IS WHERE THIS 

1966
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:43,058
HAPPENED IS AT A RITE AID 

1967
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:46,028
DISTRIBUTION CENTER . IN A 

1968
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,796
STATEMENT, THE RIGHT AID PEOPLE 

1969
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:50,399
SAY THIS IS A LARGE FACILITY -- 

1970
01:07:50,399 --> 01:08:00,509
RIGHT AID -- PEOPLE SAY THIS IS 

1971
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,377
A LARGE FACILITY. 

1972
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:02,611
MY GUESS IS THAT THERE WOULD BE 

1973
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:07,383
A LOT OF SECURITY. 

1974
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,318
WHAT WOULD THE QUESTIONS YOU 

1975
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,152
WOULD HAVE? 

1976
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:13,788
>> I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 

1977
01:08:13,788 --> 01:08:15,824
OF SPECULATION TO MALE OR 

1978
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:16,225
FEMALE. 

1979
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,060
I AM HEARING FEMALE. 

1980
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,429
WAS THE PERSON AN EMPLOYEE? 

1981
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:27,636
IF NOT, DID THE SHOOTER HAVE 

1982
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:28,604
ANY KIND OF RELATION TO PEOPLE 

1983
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:29,638
THAT WERE EMPLOYED AT THE 

1984
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:30,104
DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 

1985
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:31,540
WHEN WE START TO BREAK DOWN THE 

1986
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:32,640
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT WE KNOW OF 

1987
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,809
RIGHT NOW AND THE PEDIGREE THAT 

1988
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:34,810
HAS BEEN PROVIDED, THIS LOOKS 

1989
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,679
LIKE A WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 

1990
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,046
RELATED INCIDENT OR DOMESTIC 

1991
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:39,448
VIOLENCE. 

1992
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,183
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO A LOT 

1993
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:44,185
TO DO WITH THE RESPECT TO THE 

1994
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:44,653
RELATIONSHIP. 

1995
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,591
>> IF THIS IS A FEMALE SHOOTER, 

1996
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,325
HOW RARE IS THAT? 

1997
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:52,560
>> ANNE-MARIE,  UNFORTUNATELY, 

1998
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,596
IT IS NOT AS WERE AS MOST 

1999
01:08:54,596 --> 01:08:56,465
PEOPLE THINK. 

2000
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:58,100
OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS, WE HAVE 

2001
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,334
SEEN A SIGNIFICANT MOVE OF THE 

2002
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:01,770
NEEDLE AS IT RELATES TO FEMALES 

2003
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:07,510
INVOLVED IN VIOLENT CASES. 

2004
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,478
IT IS NOT AS RARE AS YOU THINK. 

2005
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,279
CLEARLY THE MAJORITY BEING MEN, 

2006
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,416
THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT IT IS NOT 

2007
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,484
UNCOMMON TO SEE WOMEN. 

2008
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,720
>> PAUL, BASED ON YOUR YEARS IN 

2009
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,822
LAW ENFORCEMENT, -- AND I WAS 

2010
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:25,361
REFERENCING THE DISTRIBUTION 

2011
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:26,495
CENTER BECAUSE MY GUESS WOULD 

2012
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,729
BE THAT THERE WOULD BE A GOOD 

2013
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:29,465
LEVEL OF SECURITY AT A PLACE 

2014
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:29,865
LIKE THIS. 

2015
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,200
YOU POINTED OUT TO COULD BE 

2016
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,837
WORKPLACE OR A DOMESTIC 

2017
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:36,404
ALTERCATION, SOMEBODY WOULD 

2018
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:38,240
HAVE TO BE TRUSTED TO BRING IN 

2019
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,879
A WEAPON TO FACILITY LIKE THIS? 

2020
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:44,979
UNLESS THERE PEOPLE THAT WALK 

2021
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:45,781
AROUND WITH WEAPONS, MY GUESS 

2022
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:47,015
IS THAT THEY CAME IN AND 

2023
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:48,017
CONCEALED THAT WEAPON AND KNEW 

2024
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,451
WHAT KIND OF LEVEL OF SECURITY 

2025
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,653
WAS IN PLACE TO GET A WEAPON 

2026
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,488
INTO A PLACE LIKE THIS. 

2027
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:54,623
>> CHANCES ARE THAT YOU ARE 

2028
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:55,157
CORRECT. 

2029
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,558
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE SEEN 

2030
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:57,960
AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS A 

2031
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,865
NUMBER OF TIMES, IT IS NOT 

2032
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,334
UNCOMMON FOR INDUSTRIAL PARKS 

2033
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,935
SUCH AS THIS AND AREAS OUTSIDE 

2034
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:10,572
OF MAJOR CITIES -- AND THIS IS 

2035
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:12,207
OUTSIDE OF BALTIMORE, TO HAVE 

2036
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:17,479
FAR LESS SECURITY THAN WHAT THE 

2037
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:18,514
STANDARD WOULD CALL FOR. 

2038
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,316
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT IT 

2039
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,250
WOULDN'T BE UNCOMMON IF WE WERE 

2040
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,551
TO GO OUT THERE TO SEE THAT 

2041
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,986
THEY HAD NO OUTER PERIMETER 

2042
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,454
SECURITY AND THAT THEY HAD VERY 

2043
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:28,057
LIMITED SECURITY INTO THE 

2044
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:28,791
BUILDING. 

2045
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:39,335
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THERE BUT 

2046
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:40,669
I CAN TELL YOU IT WOULDN'T BE 

2047
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,071
UNCOMMON IF WE FOUND OUT THAT 

2048
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:42,571
WERE THE CASE. 

2049
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,772
>> THIS COULD FALL INTO THE 

2050
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,007
CATEGORY OF ONE OF THOSE SOFT 

2051
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:45,307
TARGETS. 

2052
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:46,342
IT IS A DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 

2053
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:47,543
THEY ARE TRUCKS COMING IN AND 

2054
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:47,743
OUT. 

2055
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,877
THERE IS A LOT OF MOVEMENT. 

2056
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:49,678
1000 PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND. 

2057
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:50,779
IF YOU EVER WORKED IN SOMETHING 

2058
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,148
LKE THIS -- BACK IN COLLEGE I 

2059
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:54,449
WORKED IN A FACILITY SIMILAR TO 

2060
01:10:54,449 --> 01:10:57,086
THIS, COMING IN AND OUT IS NOT 

2061
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:57,386
THAT HARD. 

2062
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,520
THEIR DOORS BUT YOU CAN SEE 

2063
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,557
WHERE THE TRUCKS ARE PARKED. 

2064
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,492
THEIR WAYS TO GET IN AND OUT. 

2065
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,961
I COULD SEE IF THIS PERSON 

2066
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,897
WORKED THERE, HOW THEY COULD 

2067
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,332
WALK IN WITHOUT BEING CHECKED. 

2068
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,201
>> YOU ARE RIGHT, ANNE-MARIE 

2069
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:17,005
GREEN . SOMEONE WITH NO COMINGS 

2070
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:19,241
AND GOINGS AT THAT LOCATION -- 

2071
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:21,276
IN DISTRIBUTION CENTERS THEY 

2072
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:23,846
ARE SO LARGE THAT OFTENTIMES 

2073
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,782
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK 

2074
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:31,220
ABOUT IT, LEAVING THE BACK DOOR 

2075
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,654
OPEN SO PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND 

2076
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:35,090
OUT TO SMOKE. 

2077
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,492
PEOPLE WILL KNOW IF THEY CAN 

2078
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,726
WALK IN AND OUT OF THOSE 

2079
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:38,727
LOCATIONS AT THOSE POINTS OF 

2080
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:40,562
ACCESS WITHOUT BEING DETECTED 

2081
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:41,729
IF THERE WAS SECURITY. 

2082
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:44,233
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS 

2083
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:46,635
THAT HAVE TO BE EXAMINED. 

2084
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,272
>> THIS WAS REFERENCED DURING A 

2085
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:51,940
PRESS CONFERENCE. 

2086
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,142
WHAT KIND OF STEPS ARE 

2087
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:53,776
OFFICIALS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY 

2088
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:55,544
DOING AS WE SEE INCREASING 

2089
01:11:55,544 --> 01:12:02,384
NUMBERS? WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD 

2090
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:03,318
MASS SHOOTINGS GOING BACK TO 

2091
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:04,653
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS BUT WE 

2092
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,554
HAVE SEEN INCREASING NUMBERS 

2093
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:06,555
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY OVER THE 

2094
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:10,326
LAST 10 OR 15 YEARS. 

2095
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,427
YOU HEARD IT REFERENCED IN THE 

2096
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:12,227
PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE THEY 

2097
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,462
SAID THIS IS SOMETHING THEY 

2098
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:13,762
TRAIN FOR. 

2099
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,029
IS A STANDARD OPERATING 

2100
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:16,631
PROCEDURE NOW ACROSS ALL POLICE 

2101
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:18,801
DEPARTMENTS IN THIS COUNTRY 

2102
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,569
THAT THEY TRAIN AND PREPARE FOR 

2103
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:21,603
SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 

2104
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:22,604
>> IT REALLY IS. 

2105
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:24,640
IT REALLY IS. 

2106
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,043
AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE 

2107
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:34,783
USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE PUBLIC 

2108
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:35,283
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. 

2109
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:36,218
WHAT I MEAN, HYPOTHETICALLY IN 

2110
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:39,855
THIS INDUSTRIAL PARK, THEY HAVE 

2111
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,089
A SCHEMATIC OF THE BUILDING OR 

2112
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:41,389
BUILDINGS. 

2113
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:42,724
THEY SHARE THAT WITH LAW 

2114
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:43,658
ENFORCEMENT AND S.W.A.T. 

2115
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:48,063
TEAMS SO WHEN THEY ARE 

2116
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,698
RESPONDING THEY CAN MORE 

2117
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:55,404
EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFY WHERE THE 

2118
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:56,839
SHOOTER IS AND WHERE TO GO AND 

2119
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:57,840
HOW TO EVACUATE PEOPLE SAFELY. 

2120
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,774
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS 

2121
01:12:58,774 --> 01:12:59,208
TRAINED FOR. 

2122
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,810
THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY WITH 

2123
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:02,811
RESPECT TO SHARING SCHEMATICS 

2124
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,445
AS WELL AS THE INCORPORATION OF 

2125
01:13:04,445 --> 01:13:08,250
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS 

2126
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,787
BEING SHARED ENABLES THEM TO 

2127
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:12,888
HAVE EYES ON THE PROPERTY 

2128
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,289
BEFORE THEY GET THERE. 

2129
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,625
THESE ARE THINGS THAT MULTI-

2130
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:17,326
JURISDICTIONS AND MULTI-

2131
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,696
AGENCIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON

2132
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,564
. YEARS AGO, IT WOULD JUST BE 

2133
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:22,864
ONE AGENCY. 

2134
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:24,166
NOW THEY ARE ALL WORKING 

2135
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,299
TOGETHER AROUND THE COUNTRY. 

2136
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:28,203
>> WE ARE SHOWING LIVE VIDEO OF 

2137
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:29,238
THE SCENE RIGHT NOW. 

2138
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,473
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS PROBABLY 

2139
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:32,574
THE FRONT DOOR OF THE FACILITY. 

2140
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,175
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LITTLE 

2141
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:38,180
YELLOW MARKERS ON THE FLOOR. 

2142
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,783
>> ISN'T THAT USUALLY FOR 

2143
01:13:41,783 --> 01:13:43,185
AMMUNITION? 

2144
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:48,223
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WOULD 

2145
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:49,224
THIS PERSON GET IN, MAYBE THEY 

2146
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,592
WALKED IN THROUGH THE FRONT 

2147
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,761
DOOR. úWHAT WE ARE ALSO SEEING, 

2148
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:58,100
IS STILL -- DESPITE THE SCENE 

2149
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,134
BEING SORT OF UNDER CONTROL, A 

2150
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,135
LOT OF OFFICERS ARE WALKING 

2151
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:01,437
THROUGH THE AREA. 

2152
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,472
WHAT WOULD BE OCCURRING NOW 

2153
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,441
THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DO HAVE 

2154
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,075
THE ONLY PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR 

2155
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,243
THIS, THE SHOOTER IN THE 

2156
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:10,479
HOSPITAL, GRAVELY INJURED. 

2157
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,713
WHAT ARE OFFICERS DOING NOW? 

2158
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:15,651
>> THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY 

2159
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:16,552
TYPE OF COLLATERAL EVIDENCE. 

2160
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,220
REMEMBER, PART OF THIS,  ANNE-

2161
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,556
MARIE,  WHILE YOU ARE SEEING 

2162
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,658
THEM ON SCENE THERE ARE 

2163
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:23,258
OFFICERS OFF-SITE THAT ARE 

2164
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:24,593
LOOKING AT THE VIDEO FEEDS THAT 

2165
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,095
THEY ARE GOING TO GET FROM THAT 

2166
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:27,963
INDUSTRIAL PARK. 

2167
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,197
THEY ARE FOLLOWING STEPS THAT 

2168
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:34,169
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE TAKEN AND 

2169
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,237
THEN THEY ARE GOING TO STEP 

2170
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,271
BACK AND CREATE A PERIMETER 

2171
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,272
FROM THAT. 

2172
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,107
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE SEEING. 

2173
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,742
THEY ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF 

2174
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:46,414
THERE IS CLINICAL -- COLLATERAL 

2175
01:14:46,414 --> 01:14:47,616
EVIDENCE TO SEE IF THERE IS 

2176
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:49,518
MORE INFORMATION THAN THEY ARE 

2177
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:49,784
AWARE OF. 

2178
01:14:49,784 --> 01:14:50,886
>> PAUL, I THINK MOST AMERICANS 

2179
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:55,357
CAN UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF 

2180
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:56,525
WORKPLACE SHOOTINGS IN THIS 

2181
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,494
COUNTRY AND WHY FROM TIME TO 

2182
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,928
TIME PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO 

2183
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,197
CARRY OUT VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR

2184
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,933
COWORKERS OR AGAINST THE COMPANY

2185
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:08,704
OR AN INSTITUTION BUT EXPLAINED 

2186
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:15,110
THE EVIDENCE THAT EXISTS OUT 

2187
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,978
THERE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, 

2188
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,479
FROM THE FBI, AS TO WHY WHEN 

2189
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,313
THERE IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 

2190
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:19,114
SITUATION THAT SOMEONE WOULD 

2191
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:24,686
CHOOSE TO ATTACK A SPOUSE OR 

2192
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,721
SOMEBODY THAT THEY HAVE HAD A 

2193
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:26,522
RELATIONSHIP WITH AT THEIR 

2194
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:27,756
PLACE OF BUSINESS AND NOT JUST 

2195
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:28,357
AT THE HOME? 

2196
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,326
>> THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST -- 

2197
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,395
QUESTION OF ALL. 

2198
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,497
IT IS THE FASTEST-GROWING 

2199
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:38,266
ASPECT IN THE UNITED STATES. 

2200
01:15:38,266 --> 01:15:40,235
AND IT HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 

2201
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,069
SEVEN STRAIGHT YEARS. 

2202
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:42,471
THE REASON WHY IT IS SO 

2203
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,406
DANGEROUS AT THE WORKPLACE AND 

2204
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,441
WHY THE WORKPLACE IS CHOSEN, 

2205
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:47,676
THE WORKPLACE REPRESENTS THAT 

2206
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,646
ONE PORTION OF THAT DOMESTIC 

2207
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:54,816
VIOLENCE BATTERERS LIFE THAT HE 

2208
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:57,119
CAN'T CONTROL OR MAYBE SHE 

2209
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:58,086
CAN'T CONTROL. 

2210
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:00,254
REMEMBER IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 

2211
01:16:00,254 --> 01:16:03,492
SITUATIONS SO MUCH IS ABOUT 

2212
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:04,226
CONTROLLING AND MANIPULATING 

2213
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,595
AND MANEUVERING A LIFE AWAY 

2214
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:07,195
FROM OTHERS. 

2215
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,631
THE WORKPLACE IS A SAFE HAVEN 

2216
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,966
TO THAT PERSON THAT IS BEING 

2217
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:11,667
BATTERED. 

2218
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,970
THAT'S WHY THE BATTERER, A 

2219
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,004
PERSON THAT IS SEEKING TO 

2220
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,005
CONTROL THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS TO 

2221
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:17,839
DO THIS AT WORK. 

2222
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,576
IT IS REALLY PUTTING A FLAG IN 

2223
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,711
THE GROUND TO SAYING -- AND 

2224
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:25,981
SAYING NOBODY IS GOING TO 

2225
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,583
CONTROL THAT PERSON BUT ME. 

2226
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,118
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO 

2227
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:30,418
GO TO WORK. 

2228
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:34,990
THEY ARE GOING TO PER -- PROOF 

2229
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:35,957
THAT THIS PERSON CONTROLS THIS 

2230
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:38,326
PERSON BUT ME. 

2231
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:39,794
>> WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE 

2232
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:43,465
SITUATION. 

2233
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,200
WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF THESE 

2234
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,303
SHOOTINGS AND OFTEN PEOPLE WHEN 

2235
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,072
THEY CAN WALK IN SO EASILY HAVE 

2236
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,774
A PERSONAL CONNECTION. 

2237
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,276
BUT WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR 

2238
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:54,609
THE DETAILS. 

2239
01:16:54,609 --> 01:17:01,083
>> PAUL, WE THANK YOU AS ALWAYS.

2240
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,217
>> VLAD AND ANNE-MARIE, ALWAYS 

2241
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:02,517
A PLEASURE. 

2242
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,486
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO

LET'S TAKE YOU THERE.

TWITTER IS LIKE A RUMOR LINE. 

2249
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,073

AND PRAYERS. 

2257
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:44,259
RICK WAS LIVE AT A SCENE LESS 

2258
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,595
THAN A YEAR AGO. 

2259
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,062
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS YOU 

2260
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:49,064

THEIR COWORKERS GONE DOWN, IT 

2263
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:55,937
HAS TO STOP. 

2264
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:58,006
>> THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT 

2265
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:58,172
IT. 

2266
01:17:58,172 --> 01:18:00,408
IT'S HORRIFIC AND A TRAGEDY AND 

2267
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:01,643
NEEDS TO STOP. 

2268
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:05,580
THIS IS THE THIRD MASS SHOOTING 

2269
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,416
IN THE DISTRICT IN THE LAST 3 

2270
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:07,649
YEARS.

THE FIRST REPORT CAME OUT AT

01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:02,490
THE LEVEL VOLUNTEER FIRE HOUSE .

2367
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:03,625
THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE 

2368
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:04,225
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION LATER 

2369
01:21:04,225 --> 01:21:05,493
TODAY. 

2370
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:08,096
THEY THINK BACK PARTNERS WITH 

2371
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,331
THE FBI, DEA, MARYLAND STATE 

2372
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:12,534
POLICE, ABERDEEN POLICE, BEL 

2373
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,902
AIR POLICE. 

2374
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:15,603
THIS IS A HUGE PRESENCE OF LAW 

2375
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:20,275
ENFORCEMENT. THE ATF TRYING TO 

2376
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,309
USE RESOURCES TO TRACK THAT 

2377
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:21,610
GUN. 

2378
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:27,582
IT WAS A SINGLE GRAND CON -- 

2379
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:27,849
HANDGUN. 

2380
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:29,617
A LOAN SUSPECT IN THE SHOOTING. 

2381
01:21:29,617 --> 01:21:33,488
WE HAVE SEEN MEDEVAC HERE. 

2382
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:34,289
WE BELIEVE THEY WERE AIRLIFTING 

2383
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:35,724
PEOPLE FROM THE SCENE. 

2384
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,292
WE SAW PEOPLE EVACUATED FROM 

2385
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,393
THE SCENE. 

2386
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:41,396
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT 

2387
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,930
THE SUSPECT AT THIS POINT. 

2388
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,900
POLICE ARE KEEPING THAT CLOSE 

2389
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:54,709
TO THE VET -- VAST RIGHT NOW. 

2390
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,812
-- VEST RIGHT NOW. 

2391
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:00,715
POLICE SAY THEY DID NOT FIRE A 

2392
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:01,716
SHOT IN THIS. 

2393
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,318
WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR MORE 

2394
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:03,651
INFORMATION. 

2395
01:22:03,651 --> 01:22:05,086
IF YOU REMEMBER THAT SHOOTING 

2396
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,423
THAT HAPPENED 11 MONTHS AGO, WE 

2397
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,058
HAD A SUSPECT ON THE LOOSE. 

2398
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,092
THEY WERE PUTTING OUT THAT 

2399
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,329
PERSON'S PICTURE. 

2400
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,463
WE GOT A LOT MORE INFORMATION 

2401
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:22,137
RIGHT OFF THE BAT IN THAT CASE. 

2402
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,238
IN THIS CASE, IT IS DIFFERENT. 

2403
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:24,572
THEY HAVE THE PERSON IN CUSTODY 

2404
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,874
SO THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY TOO 

2405
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:27,142
MUCH AND PIECE THIS TOGETHER. 

2406
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,476
WE DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVE. 

2407
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:32,881
>> MIKE, ALL DAY THEY REFUSED 

2408
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,015
TO TAKE QUESTIONS, AS YOU JUST 

2409
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,250
SAID THEY DID MAKE A SPECIFIC 

2410
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:39,687
COMMENT WAS THAT NO STRUTS -- 

2411
01:22:39,687 --> 01:22:40,922
SHOTS WERE FIRED BY AN OFFICER 

2412
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,957
WHICH WOULD LEAD THEM TO THINK 

2413
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:44,059
THE SUSPECT WAS SHOT 

2414
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:44,359
THEMSELVES. 

2415
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:45,593
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER THAT BUT 

2416
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:46,827
THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION. 

2417
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:48,629
WOULD YOU AGREE? 

2418
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:50,298
>> Reporter: I WOULD AGREE. 

2419
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,234
I WOULD AGREE. 

2420
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,436
OFFICIALLY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING 

2421
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,438
IS THAT THIS SUSPECT IS IN 

2422
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:57,572
CRITICAL CONDITION AND THEY DID 

2423
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:58,807
NOT FIRE ANY SHOTS. 

2424
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,441
OR AN OFFICER DID NOT FIRE 

2425
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:02,243
SHOTS. 

2426
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:03,711
WE WILL EVENTUALLY HEAR THIS 

2427
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:05,713
PERSON'S NAME. 

2428
01:23:05,713 --> 01:23:07,382
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS PERSON 

2429
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:10,085
HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED AT THIS 

2430
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:10,385
POINT. 

2431
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,019
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE 

2432
01:23:12,019 --> 01:23:13,421
INJURIES. 

2433
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,856
I'M SURE THAT IS PART OF ALL OF 

2434
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:15,089
THIS. 

2435
01:23:15,089 --> 01:23:18,293
A KEY COMPONENT ON IF THIS 

2436
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,194
PERSON WILL COOPERATE AND 

2437
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:20,128
EXACTLY WHY THAT PERSON OPENED 

2438
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:23,998
FIRE AND THEIR NECKS INTO THIS 

2439
01:23:23,998 --> 01:23:24,599
BUSINESS HERE. 

2440
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,201
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOMENT 

2441
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:29,270
WAS -- MOTIVE WAS. 

2442
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:30,505
AS THEY HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY, 

2443
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,040
THIS IS STILL VERY PRELIMINARY 

2444
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,176
OUT HERE. 

2445
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,379
>> MIKE, WE ARE LOOKING AT LIVE 

2446
01:23:38,379 --> 01:23:39,214
PICTURE FROM CHOPPER 13 AS 

2447
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,415
PEOPLE ARE BEING EVACUATED FROM 

2448
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:40,849
THAT BUILDING. 

2449
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,217
THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED BY 

2450
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:47,555
SCHOOL BUSES. 

2451
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,456
MORE THAN 1000 EMPLOYEES WORK 

2452
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:48,990
AT THAT FACILITY. 

2453
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:49,991
ALSO, WE ARE EXPECTING AN 

2454
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,526
UPDATE FROM JOHNS HOPKINS 

2455
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,628
BAYVIEW CAMPUS. 

2456
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:55,229
SOME OF THE VICTIMS ARE 

2457
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:55,663
TRANSPORTED THERE. 

2458
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:59,167
MIKE, TO ASK ABOUT THE TIMELINE 

2459
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,402
AS THIS UNFOLDED, WE ARE 

2460
01:24:01,402 --> 01:24:02,370
TALKING ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER 

2461
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,606
9:00 THIS MORNING. 

2462
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:05,807
THEN WE SAW THAT HELICOPTER 

2463
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:07,876
LAND AND TAKE OFF BEHIND YOU. 

2464
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,078
THAT WAS LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO. 

2465
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,946
WE KEEP SAYING THAT IS A FLUID 

2466
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:13,748
SCENE. IT'S UNCLEAR BUT THEY 

2467
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:18,019
ARE STILL RESPONDING. 

2468
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,087
>> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW THE 

2469
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,055
EXTENT OF THE INJURIES OF THE 

2470
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:22,490
PEOPLE WHO WERE WOUNDED. 

2471
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:25,727
WE ARE LIVE ON THE AIR AND A 

2472
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,095
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SHERIFF'S 

2473
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:29,397
OFFICE, CHRISTIE HOPKINS, WE 

2474
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,232
HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU BEFORE IN 

2475
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:32,967
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 

2476
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:34,502
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR MAIN MESSAGE 

2477
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,838
TO THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW? 

2478
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:39,307
>> I THINK WE ARE SEEING MORE 

2479
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:40,975
AND MORE OF THESE SITUATIONS 

2480
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,178
THAT THEY ARE NOT PREVENTABLE. 

2481
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:46,614
KNOW COMMUNITY IS IMMUNE AND SO 

2482
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:48,082
PREPARATION IS KEY. 

2483
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:48,783
TRAINING IS KEY. 

2484
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,451
WE SPENT MANY HOURS AND DAYS 

2485
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:51,920
TRAINING PEOPLE ON EXACTLY WHAT 

2486
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,887
TO DO IF THERE IS A WORKPLACE 

2487
01:24:53,887 --> 01:24:59,260
VIOLENCE INCIDENT OR AN ACTIVE 

2488
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,261
SHOOTER AT THE MALL, YOUR 

2489
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:08,436
WORKPLACE, WHEREVER IT MAY BE. 

2490
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,904
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT 

2491
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:10,538
THESE SITUATIONS AND 

2492
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:11,439
INVESTIGATE WHY THEY HAPPEN BUT 

2493
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:12,840
WE ALSO NEED TO BE TRAINING 

2494
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,875
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO 

2495
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,076
WHEN THIS IS AT YOUR DOORSTEP. 

2496
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:16,211
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW TODAY. 

2497
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:17,011
WE SAW PEOPLE TAKING 

2498
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,146
PRECAUTIONS THAT WE HAVE TALKED 

2499
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,347
ABOUT IN THE NEWS FOR SO LONG. 

2500
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,582
WE ALSO SAW THE RESCUE TASK 

2501
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:21,583
FORCE PUT IN PLACE. 

2502
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,118
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SAW IT 

2503
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,586
ADVANCED GRANITE WHEN THEY HAD 

2504
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:25,853
THAT SHOOTING WHERE WE ARE NOW 

2505
01:25:25,853 --> 01:25:27,989
TRYING TO HAVE EMS PROVIDERS 

2506
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:30,024
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT GO IN 

2507
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,827
TOGETHER TO HOPEFULLY SAVE LIVES

2508
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:33,928
INSIDE. 

2509
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:37,165
>> PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY WANT 

2510
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,066
MORE INFORMATION AND HOW THIS 

2511
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:38,333
UNFOLDED. 

2512
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,801
I KNOW THE OFFICE IS SAYING 

2513
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,336
HOLD ON A BIT. 

2514
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:43,304
>> THIS IS A FLUID 

2515
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:43,671
INVESTIGATION. 

2516
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,306
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION 

2517
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:47,809
THAT IS PROVEN NOT TO BE TRUE. 

2518
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:52,046
I VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO 

2519
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:52,981
ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION WE 

2520
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:53,881
ARE GIVING THE COMMUNITY IS 

2521
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:56,317
TRUE AND FACTUAL AND CONFIRMED 

2522
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:57,085
INFORMATION. 

2523
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,620
WE WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE 

2524
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:02,624
RESOURCES. 

2525
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:03,224
PLEASE FOLLOW US. 

2526
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,459
THAT IS YOUR CONFIRMED SOURCE 

2527
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:04,826
OF INFORMATION. 

2528
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,895
WE WANT TO PROVIDE YOU ANSWERS 

2529
01:26:07,895 --> 01:26:09,397
AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO 

2530
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:09,864
HAVE THEM. 

2531
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,199
AS SOON AS WE KNOW THEM, WE'LL 

2532
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,167
LET THE COMMUNITY KNOW 

2533
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:18,506
>> PEOPLE SHOULD FEEL LIKE THEY 

2534
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,842
ARE IN ANY DANGER RIGHT NOW. 

2535
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,644
>> WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE 

2536
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:26,681
THERE IS ANY FURTHER THREAT. 

2537
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:29,851
>> ANY OTHER MESSAGES FOR THE 

2538
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:30,151
COMMUNITY? 

2539
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:31,653
WE DID A STORY WITH YOU ABOUT 

2540
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:32,287
THOSE FIRST RESPONDERS BEING 

2541
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:32,654
TRAINED. 

2542
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:33,688
I'M SURE THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE 

2543
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,323
WITH THE OTHER SHOOTING 11 

2544
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:35,656
MONTHS AGO. 

2545
01:26:35,656 --> 01:26:37,725
AND AGAIN TODAY, I'M SURE THAT 

2546
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,094
KIND OF TRAINING WAS ESSENTIAL 

2547
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,162
IN THIS? 

2548
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:41,729
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

2549
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:45,600
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF TRAINING 

2550
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,135
S THAT SAVE LIVES. 

2551
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,569
>> THANK YOU. 

2552
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:51,472
I KNOW WE WILL BE UPDATED BY 

2553
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:51,672
YOU. 

2554
01:26:51,672 --> 01:26:54,008
THAT IS THE LATEST HERE. 

2555
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:55,009
WE ARE AWAITING A PRESS 

2556
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,544
CONFERENCE FROM JOHN HOPKINS 

2557
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:57,878
BAYVIEW ABOUT MORE OF THE 

2558
01:26:57,878 --> 01:27:03,584
VICTIMS. THE SHERIFF OFFICE 

2559
01:27:03,584 --> 01:27:04,752
WILL NOT OFFICIALLY GIVE A 

2560
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,921
NUMBER. 

2561
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:07,454
THEY ARE SAYING MULTIPLE 

2562
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:08,957
WOUNDED AND MULTIPLE FATALITIES.

2563
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,192
I HAD PEOPLE ASK ON TWITTER, WE 

2564
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:13,928
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? 

2565
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:15,363
WHY CAN'T THEY GIVE OUT MORE 

2566
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:16,130
INFORMATION? 

2567
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,865
BE PATIENT. 

2568
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,734
THIS IS PRELIMINARY. 

2569
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,371
THIS IS JUST UNFOLDING. 

2570
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:24,472
THERE IS A LOT THEY ARE TRYING 

2571
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:25,907
TO LEARN AND THEY WANT TO MAKE 

2572
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,108
SURE WHAT IS OUT THERE IS 

2573
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:27,609
ACCURATE. 

2574
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:28,576
YOU HEARD IT FROM THE SHERIFF'S 

2575
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:28,943
OFFICE. 

2576
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:30,311
YOU SAW THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 

2577
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:33,448
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

2578
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:33,948
FOLLOW THIS SITUATION. 

2579
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:37,185
IT IS STILL A LARGE POLICE 

2580
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,385
PRESENCE YOU'RE AT THE SCENE. 

2581
01:27:38,385 --> 01:27:39,954
>> PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING 

2582
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:42,056
EVACUATED. 

2583
01:27:42,056 --> 01:27:42,957
IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THEY 

2584
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:43,991
ARE NOT GIVING OUT INFORMATION. 

2585
01:27:43,991 --> 01:27:45,760
THE FIRST PRIORITY IS TO TREAT 

2586
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,596
THE INJURED. WE DON'T KNOW HOW 

2587
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:49,964
INJURED THEY MAY BE. 

2588
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:53,968
THEY MAY BE CRITICAL. THEY WANT 

2589
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:55,002
TO SAVE THEIR LIVES AND THEN 

2590
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:56,170
IDENTIFY THEM AND THEN NOTIFY 

2591
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,805
FAMILIES AND THEN THE PUBLIC. 

2592
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,041
LET'S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION 

2593
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,675
THAT MIKE WAS HAVING WITH THE 

2594
01:28:01,675 --> 01:28:03,478
SPOKESWOMAN A MOMENT AGO. 

2595
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,179
LET'S GO TO RICK RITTER TALKING 

2596
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,349
ABOUT ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS. 

2597
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:11,786
I KNOW HEARD THE EXECUTIVE 

2598
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,020
TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY JUST HAD 

2599
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,055
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILL. 

2600
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:15,923
ONE WOULD HOPE THAT EVERYBODY 

2601
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:18,092
IN THE FACILITY KNEW WHAT TO DO 

2602
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,894
WHEN THEY HEARD THERE WERE 

2603
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:21,095
SHOTS FIRED. 

2604
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,163
RICK. 

2605
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:26,267
>> Reporter: DENISE, BARRY IS 

2606
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,002
THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THEY HAVE 

2607
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:28,870
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS 

2608
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,471
WITH THREE MASS SHOOTINGS IN 3 

2609
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:31,005
YEARS. 

2610
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:33,941
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. 

2611
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:34,842
THAT'S WHY DEPUTIES WERE ABLE 

2612
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,712
TO RESPOND WITHIN MINUTES WHEN 

2613
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:39,180
THIS FIRST UNFOLDED AROUND 9:00 

2614
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,448
THIS MORNING. 

2615
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,849
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

2616
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:42,683
THAT ARE UNANSWERED RIGHT NOW. 

2617
01:28:42,683 --> 01:28:44,518
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BEGGING FOR 

2618
01:28:44,518 --> 01:28:46,254
MORE INFORMATION AND TRYING TO 

2619
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:51,526
FIGURE OUT WHAT TOOK PLACE. 

2620
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:52,627
NOW THAT WE KNOW THE SUSPECT IS 

2621
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:53,561
IN CUSTODY IN CRITICAL 

2622
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:54,462
CONDITION, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE 

2623
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,063
THAT AGENTS ARE DIGGING INTO 

2624
01:28:56,063 --> 01:28:59,367
THAT SUSPECT'S INFORMATION 

2625
01:28:59,367 --> 01:28:59,767

2626
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,102

RECORDS, COMPUTERS, TRYING TO 

2629
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:06,841
FIND OUT MORE. 

2630
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:07,875
WE KNOW IT TOOK PLACE AROUND 

2631
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:08,576
9:00 THIS MORNING. 

2632
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:10,011
MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 

2633
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:10,711
MULTIPLE WERE WOUNDED. 

2634
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:12,814
CHOPPER 13 HAS STILL BEEN OVER 

2635
01:29:12,814 --> 01:29:13,114
THE SCENE. 

2636
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,783
PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED OUT OF 

2637
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,151
THAT RITE AID DISTRIBUTION 

2638
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:17,819
CENTER.  

2639
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,720
THERE ARE MORE THAN 1000 PEOPLE 

2640
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,055
EMPLOYED. 

2641
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,089
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT 

2642
01:29:22,089 --> 01:29:22,890
MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

2643
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:23,123
KILLED. 

2644
01:29:23,123 --> 01:29:24,391
THIS IS ANOTHER TRAGIC 

2645
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:26,461
SITUATION. 

2646
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:27,562
IT SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY I 

2647
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:28,829
STOOD IN THIS AREA REPORTING ON 

2648
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:30,498
ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING TAKING 

2649
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:32,633
PLACE AT ADVANCED GRANITE 

2650
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:34,702
SOLUTIONS. 

2651
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:36,137
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE A LOT OF 

2652
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:37,538
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. 

2653
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:38,439
THAT'S WHY DEPUTIES WERE ABLE 

2654
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:39,574
TO RESPOND SO QUICKLY AND 

2655
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:43,511
HOPEFULLY STOP IT BEFORE IT WAS 

2656
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:44,011
A LOT WORSE. 

2657
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:45,713
STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAIN 

2658
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:46,381
UNANSWERED. 

2659
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,049
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE 

2660
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:50,318

2661
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,452

THINGS HAVE QUIETED DOWN QUITE 

2665
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:57,859
A BIT. 

2666
01:29:57,859 --> 01:29:59,193
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SHERIFF HAS 

2667
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:00,495
LEFT THE SCENE. 

2668
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:01,496
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET ANOTHER

01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,926
COMMUNITY THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE 

2709
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:45,466
REASON TO WORRY ABOUT A THREAT.

01:32:32,613 --> 01:32:35,282
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHURCH 

2727
01:32:35,282 --> 01:32:35,515
CREEK. 

2728
01:32:35,515 --> 01:32:36,484
THAT WAS COMPLETELY AS A 

2729
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:36,784
PRECAUTION. 

2730
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:40,054
LET'S GO BACK TO MIKE WHO WAS 

2731
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:45,026
ONE OF THE FIRST ON THE SCENE. 

2732
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:46,027
>> Reporter: WE ARE STILL 

2733
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:47,261
TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION AS 

2734
01:32:47,261 --> 01:32:48,962
TO THE MOTIVE AS TO WHY THIS 

2735
01:32:48,962 --> 01:32:50,431
UNFOLDED. 

2736
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:52,133
THE SHERIFF DID NOT TAKE ANY 

2737
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:52,433
QUESTIONS. 

2738
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,168
HE WANTED TO TELL THE COMMUNITY 

2739
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:56,037
THAT THE AREA WAS SAFE AND 

2740
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:58,339
THERE IS NO FURTHER THREAT. 

2741
01:32:58,339 --> 01:32:59,240
HE PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION 

2742
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,042
ABOUT THAT -- 

2743
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:02,877
>> WE HAVE BEEN DIPPING INTO 

2744
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:06,447
LOCAL COVERAGE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

2745
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:07,748
DOCTORS ARE SPEAKING OUTSIDE OF 

2746
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:08,783
THE HOSPITAL WERE A NUMBER OF 

2747
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:10,051
THE VICTIMS ARE. 

2748
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,085
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

2749
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:12,552
>> I'M THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR 

2750
01:33:12,552 --> 01:33:15,890
HERE. 

2751
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,191
ABOUT ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS 

2752
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:19,727
THAT WE RECEIVED FOR PEOPLE 

2753
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:23,431
FROM THE INCIDENT THIS MORNING. 

2754
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,400
THEY ALL CAME AS A LEVEL TRUE 

2755
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,105
THOMAS CENTER -- LEVEL TWO 

2756
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,140
TRAUMA CENTER. 

2757
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,475
WHERE WAITING FOR FAMILIES TO 

2758
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,043
BE NOTIFIED BEFORE WE CAN GIVE 

2759
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:39,046
YOU SPECIFICS. 

2760
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:40,481
REALLY ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS 

2761
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:42,350
THAT WE RECEIVED FOUR PATIENTS 

2762
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,518
WITH WOUNDS EARLIER TODAY. 

2763
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:49,790
>> [ INDISCERNIBLE QUESTION ]. 

2764
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,958
>> TO US THEY ARE ALL PATIENTS.

01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,694
EVERYTHING WE KNOW HIS SECOND 

2766
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:54,996
AND THIRD HAND. 

2767
01:33:54,996 --> 01:33:56,130
I REALLY CAN'T COMMENT IF ONE 

2768
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:03,571
IS A SHOOTER. 

2769
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:06,073
>> [ INDISCERNIBLE QUESTION ]. 

2770
01:34:06,073 --> 01:34:07,942
>> WE HAVE TO WAIT TO MAKE SURE 

2771
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:09,710
FAMILIES ARE NOTIFIED BEFORE WE 

2772
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:13,380
CAN GIVE YOU DETAILS. 

2773
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,582
>> DID ALL FOUR HAVE GUNSHOT 

2774
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:14,982
WOUNDS? 

2775
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:15,750
>> YES. 

2776
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:23,924
GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 

2777
01:34:23,924 --> 01:34:27,928

2779
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:33,934
THEY ALL SUFFERED GUNSHOT 

2780
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:34,167
WOUNDS. 

2781
01:34:34,167 --> 01:34:35,769
UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK 

2782
01:34:35,769 --> 01:34:41,609
TO FAMILIES FIRST, I THINK THAT 

2783
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:42,743
IS BEST FOR THE FAMILIES TO 

2784
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:43,644
LEARN THEIR CONDITIONS FROM US 

2785
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:44,645
DIRECTLY RATHER THAN THROUGH 

2786
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:45,412
YOU, UNFORTUNATELY. 

2787
01:34:45,412 --> 01:34:47,181
YES. 

2788
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:49,750
>> HAVE ANY OF THE VICTIMS BEEN 

2789
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,451
TAKEN INTO SURGERY? 

2790
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:51,919
>> SOME HAVE REQUIRED SURGICAL 

2791
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:52,119
CARE. 

2792
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,155
>> WERE THEY TAKEN BY MEDEVAC 

2793
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:54,455
OR GROUND? 

2794
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:58,058
>> BY GROUND. 

2795
01:34:58,058 --> 01:35:00,194
MARYLAND HAS AN EXCELLENT EMS 

2796
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:00,427
SYSTEM. 

2797
01:35:00,427 --> 01:35:03,698
IT IS VERY WELL ORGANIZED. 

2798
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,834
THEY ARE ALL BENEFICIARIES OF 

2799
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:07,334
THAT SYSTEM. 

2800
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:08,768
THEY WERE BROUGHT HERE RAPIDLY. 

2801
01:35:08,768 --> 01:35:11,671
>> CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF 

2802
01:35:11,671 --> 01:35:13,107
THEIR RARITY WHEN THEY WERE 

2803
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:15,075
FIRST BROUGHT IN? 

2804
01:35:15,075 --> 01:35:17,545
>> IT HAS A TRIAGE SCALE. 

2805
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,747
THEY WERE ALL CONSIDERED 

2806
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:21,215
PRIORITY ONE. 

2807
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,116
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY SUFFERED 

2808
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:22,650
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

IS HERE. 

2813
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:31,258
THEY WENT TODAY ARRIVE? 

2814
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:34,061
>> PROBABLY AROUND 10:00 A.M. 

2815
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:36,297
>> ARE THEY ALL ADULTS? 

2816
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:38,265

CONTACT NUMBERS FOR THEM TO 

2820
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:48,209
CALL. 

2821
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:50,010
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CALLED THE 

2822
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:53,314
HOSPITAL DIRECTLY THAT THEY ARE 

2823
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:54,515
GOING TO SHARE MORE INFORMATION 

2824
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:54,948
ABOUT SPECIFICS. 

2825
01:35:54,948 --> 01:35:55,749
I BELIEVE AUTHORITIES WILL 

2826
01:35:55,749 --> 01:35:58,786
NOTIFY ALL THE PATIENTS AND LET 

2827
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:00,454
THEM KNOW THEY ARE HERE. 

2828
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,689
ONCE WE HAVE HAD CONFIRMATION 

2829
01:36:02,689 --> 01:36:03,891
THAT HAS HAPPENED, THEN WE CAN 

2830
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,693
GIVE MORE INFORMATION. 

2831
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:07,261

01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:11,832

2834
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:25,913
THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED 

2835

MIMS.  

2836
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,182
THEY ARE ALL TRAINED ON THE 

2837
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:31,318
MIMS  PROTOCOLS. 

2838
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:32,686
THERE ARE CERTAIN INJURIES THAT 

2839
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:36,857
THEY WOULD DO BEST IF THEY CAME 

2840
01:36:36,857 --> 01:36:37,992
TO A DESIGNATED TRAUMA CENTER. 

2841
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:39,426
SO IF THE PROVIDERS FEEL THEY 

2842
01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:40,227
MEET THOSE CRITERIA THEY WILL 

2843
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:42,896

MARYLAND. 

2846
01:36:44,297 --> 01:36:47,234
FOR THIS PART, BAY VIEW IS THE 

2847
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:48,302
CLOSEST TRAUMA CENTER TO SERVE 

2848
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:48,802
THEM. 

2849
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:52,973

2855
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:07,087
THIS IS ONE EVENT WHERE THAT 

2856
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:09,823

SPECIFIC PATIENTS. 

2912
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:10,544
>> AUTHORITIES ARE THE ONES 

2913
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:12,680
THAT ARE REACHING OUT FOR THOSE 

2914
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:12,946
CONTACTS. 

2915
01:39:12,946 --> 01:39:13,747
OKAY? 

2916
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:22,256
THANK YOU. 

2917
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:25,059
>> SO WE ARE NOT GETTING A LOT 

2918
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,427
OF INFORMATION FROM DOCTORS 

2919
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:30,097
HERE AT JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW. 

2920
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:31,498
HE SAID THEY ARE TREATING THEM 

2921
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:32,299
FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS.  

2922
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:33,333
THIS STEMS FROM A SHOOTING THAT 

2923
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:36,170
HAPPENED MUCH EARLIER IN THE DAY

2924
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:37,571
,  SHORTLY AFTER 9:00 AT THIS 

2925
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:40,407
RITE AID DISTRIBUTION CENTER . 

2926
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:41,842
WHAT WE ARE LEARNING IS THAT 

2927
01:39:41,842 --> 01:39:44,678
THE SHOOTER ENTERED THE FACILITY

2928
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:45,379
AND BEGAN SHOOTING. 

2929
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:49,216
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED -- NOT 

2930
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:50,250
FROM POLICE BUT THE ASSOCIATED 

2931
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:52,119
PRESS AND IS YET TO BE 

2932
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:55,656
CONFIRMED BY OFFICERS THAT AT 

2933
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,557
LEAST THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 

2934
01:39:56,557 --> 01:39:57,758
SEVERAL MORE WERE ALSO SHOT AND 

2935
01:39:57,758 --> 01:39:58,024
WOUNDED. 

2936
01:39:58,024 --> 01:39:59,093
IT APPEARS AS IF THE SHOOTER 

2937
01:39:59,093 --> 01:40:02,996
WAS ALSO WOUNDED. WE DON'T KNOW 

2938
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:04,398
IF IT WAS A GUNSHOT WOUND OR 

2939
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:04,698
NOT. 

2940
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:06,233
THAT SHOOTER IS IN CRITICAL 

2941
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,769
CONDITION IN THE HOSPITAL. 

2942
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:10,671
>> ONE OF THE REASONS THERE 

2943
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:11,905
WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THROWN 

2944
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:13,140
AT THE DOCTOR BUT HE WASN'T 

2945
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:13,907
GIVING INFORMATION IS BECAUSE 

2946
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:17,478
SOME OF THE ONLY MEMBERS 

2947
01:40:17,478 --> 01:40:17,978
HAVEN'T BEEN NOTIFIED. 

2948
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:19,179
ONCE WE GET MORE INFORMATION 

2949
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:20,114
FROM THE HOSPITAL AND THE 

2950
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:21,481
POLICE, WE'LL SHARE THAT WITH 

2951
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:22,850

LET'S LISTEN IN. 

2955
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:34,228
>> I THINK THE AUTHORITIES ARE 

2956
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:35,262
THE ONES THAT ARE REACHING OUT 

2957
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:37,297
FOR THOSE CONTACTS. 

2958
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:39,333
OKAY? 

2959
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,300
ALL RIGHT. 

2960
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:46,206
THANK YOU. 

2961
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:47,641
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO A 

2962
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:48,942
DOCTOR AT JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW  

2963
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:50,677
TALK ABOUT THE FOUR PATIENTS 

2964
01:40:50,677 --> 01:40:53,313
WHO WERE TAKEN TO THEIR TRAUMA 

2965
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:53,947
CENTER. 

2966
01:40:53,947 --> 01:40:54,748
WHAT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE 

2967
01:40:54,748 --> 01:40:56,884
ARE FOUR PATIENTS THAT ARE BEING

2968
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:59,386
TREATED AT THE TRAUMA CENTER. 

2969
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:05,526
TO HIM, TO THE HOSPITAL, THEY 

2970
01:41:05,526 --> 01:41:06,026
ARE PATIENTS. 

2971
01:41:06,026 --> 01:41:07,528
HE COULD NOT CONFIRM OR DENY IF 

2972
01:41:07,528 --> 01:41:08,562
THE SHOOTER WAS TAKEN TO JOHN 

2973
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:09,163
HOPKINS BAYVIEW. 

2974
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:10,831
>> I WAS HOPING SOMEBODY WOULD 

2975
01:41:10,831 --> 01:41:12,299
ASK , DEVON SAID THERE WERE 

2976
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:17,104
SEVERAL GUARDS OUT THERE WITH 

2977
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:18,705
THE PROOF VEST. 

2978
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:20,407
>> DEVON TWEETED THIS. 

2979
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:24,811
>> SO MY QUESTION IS, WHY? 

2980
01:41:24,811 --> 01:41:26,446
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? 

2981
01:41:26,446 --> 01:41:28,982
ARE THEY STILL WALKING AROUND. 

2982
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:29,883
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS 

2983
01:41:29,883 --> 01:41:32,619
NOT A THREAT TO THE HOSPITAL. 

2984
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:33,519
THERE IS NOT AN IMMEDIATE 

2985
01:41:33,519 --> 01:41:35,189
úTHRE.

2986
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:36,390
BUT IT IS AS CLEAR -- UNCLEAR 

2987
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:41,161
AS TO WHY THAT IS THE CASE. 

2988
01:41:41,161 --> 01:41:44,331
LET'S GO BACK OUT TO RICK RITTER

2989
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:46,133
LIVE WITH MORE. 

2990
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:47,768
RICK. 

2991
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,470
>> AGAIN, THAT WAS A DOCTOR FOR

THEY WERE ALL PRIORITY ONE. 

2996
01:42:01,114 --> 01:42:01,681
SOME HAVE ALREADY UNDERGONE 

2997
01:42:01,681 --> 01:42:04,518
SURGERY. 

2998
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:05,652
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO NOTIFY 

2999
01:42:05,652 --> 01:42:05,952
FAMILIES. 

3000
01:42:05,952 --> 01:42:07,254
THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW 

3001
01:42:07,254 --> 01:42:08,288
MANY PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 

3002
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:09,389

HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. 

3033
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:59,072
>> I FOLLOWED THIS FROM THE 

3034
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:01,742
MOMENT THE CALL CAME IN ON 

3035
01:43:01,742 --> 01:43:02,008
DISPATCH. 

3036
01:43:02,008 --> 01:43:05,245
I LISTENED TO THE RADIO

TRANSMISSIONS. 

3038
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:07,180
UNFORTUNATELY IN TODAY'S WORLD

01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:20,093
THE TOP OF THEIR PROFESSION. 

3044
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:21,194
AND THE RESPONSE FROM ALL THE

US TODAY TO GET THROUGH THIS. 

3051
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:37,344
THIS IS BECOMING A TOO OFTEN 

3052
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:39,413
OCCURRENCE NOT ONLY IN HARFORD

NORMAL. 

3057
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:50,557
SO MANY AGENCIES ARE DOING 

3058
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:51,558
TRAINING AND MAKING SURE THEY 

3059
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:52,893

3060
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,728
IN ALL OF THIS.

UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS SO MUCH 

3062
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:57,597
EXPERIENCE. 

3063
01:43:57,597 --> 01:43:59,533
THREE MASS SHOOTINGS IN 3 YEARS.

3064
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:02,636
THE LAST ONE TAKING PLACE 

3065
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:05,172
LITERALLY 11 MONTHS AGO ABOUT

01:44:05,172 --> 01:44:06,440
SEVEN MILES FROM HERE AT

01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,307
ANOTHER SHOOTING. 

3068
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:08,342
THAT SUSPECT WAS TAKEN INTO 

3069
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:11,044
CUSTODY MUCH LATER ON. 

3070
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:12,579

CUSTODY IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 

3072
01:44:14,214 --> 01:44:17,451
THIS IS A HEARTBREAKING 

3073
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:17,884
SCENARIO. 

3074
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:19,853
LOVED ONES ARE TRYING TO FIND 

3075
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:21,521

PEOPLE ARE REACHING OUT AND 

3077
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:26,727
DROPPING THEIR NAMES ASKING IF 

3078
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:30,931
THEY KNOW THEM. 

3079
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:31,464
THAT'S THE HEARTBREAKING 

3080
01:44:31,464 --> 01:44:32,332
SITUATIONS THAT WE ARE STARTING 

3081
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:34,167

3082
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:35,402
AGAIN, MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE

3087
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:44,177
NOW THAT THEY HAVE THAT 

3088
01:44:44,177 --> 01:44:45,445
SUSPECT, THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW 

3089
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:48,949
THE SUSPECT'S IDENTITY. 

3090
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:51,184
THEY ARE GOING TO BE DIGGING 

3091
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:51,985
INTO THEIR BACKGROUND AND 

3092
01:44:51,985 --> 01:44:56,156
TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION. 

3093
01:44:56,156 --> 01:44:57,090
COMPUTERS, CELL PHONE RECORDS, 

3094
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:58,091
SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE HE OR SHE 

3095
01:44:58,091 --> 01:44:59,326
KNOWS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 

3096
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:00,459
WHY THIS UNFOLDED. 

3097
01:45:00,459 --> 01:45:02,562
>> RICK, INTERRUPTING YOU FOR A 

3098
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:04,965
SECOND, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY 

3099
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:09,903
RIGHT. 

3100
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:11,071
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO 

3101
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:11,438
ARE DISTRESSED. 

3102
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:12,939
IN CASE YOU HAVE NOT HEARD, WE 

3103
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:13,840
WILL REPEAT THIS THROUGHOUT THE 

3104
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,141
DAY. 

3105
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,142
THERE IS A PHONE NUMBER THAT 

3106
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:16,376
THE HARFORD COUNTY  SHERIFF'S 

3107
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:17,177
OFFICE HAS SET UP. 

3108
01:45:17,177 --> 01:45:18,612
WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS. 

3109
01:45:18,612 --> 01:45:19,513
THE DOCTOR AT JOHN HOPKINS 

3110
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:22,883
BAYVIEW  CAN'T GIVE 

3111
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:23,216
INFORMATION. 

3112
01:45:23,216 --> 01:45:26,420
THE NUMBER IS 410-838-5800.  

3113
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,854
FEEL FREE TO HAND THAT OUT ON 

3114
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:30,823
SOCIAL MEDIA TO ANYONE WHO YOU 

3115
01:45:30,823 --> 01:45:33,860
THINK NEEDS TO KNOW IT. 

3116
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:34,460
THAT IS 410-838-5800. 

3117
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,562
THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT THE 

3118
01:45:35,562 --> 01:45:42,202
SHERIFF'S  OFFICE IS SET UP. IF 

3119
01:45:42,202 --> 01:45:44,504
YOU KNOW SOMEONE OR YOUR RELATED

3120
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:46,239
TO SOMEONE, HOPE YOU CAN GET 

3121
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:46,640
ANSWERS. 

3122
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,210
I ALSO GOT A TWEET FROM AN 

3123
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,945
OFFICIAL WHO SAID IT IS 

3124
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:53,747
PROTOCOL TO WEAR A VEST WHEN 

3125
01:45:53,747 --> 01:45:54,781
RESPONDING TO ANY CALL 

3126
01:45:54,781 --> 01:45:57,718
INVOLVING THE POSSIBILITY OF 

3127
01:45:57,718 --> 01:45:58,085
PERSONAL HARM. 

3128
01:45:58,085 --> 01:46:00,053
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

3129
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:01,621
MY QUESTION IS REGARDING THE 

3130
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:02,689
HOSPITAL SPECIFICALLY. 

3131
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:06,359
HE DID SAY IT IS BUSINESS AS 

3132
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:12,065
USUAL AS FAR AS THEY KNOW. 

3133
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:13,200
ANYTIME YOU HAVE A SITUATION 

3134
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,501
LIKE THIS, MY QUESTION WOULD BE 

3135
01:46:14,501 --> 01:46:15,602
IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE SUSPECT IN 

3136
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,304
THE CASE WAS TAKEN TO JOHN 

3137
01:46:17,304 --> 01:46:19,139
HOPKINS BAYVIEW  AND IF THERE 

3138
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:21,741
IS ANY THREAT TO ANYONE IN THAT 

3139
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:25,378
TRAUMA DEPARTMENT. THAT'S WHY I 

3140
01:46:25,378 --> 01:46:27,481
WAS TRYING TO SEE THAT THERE 

3141
01:46:27,481 --> 01:46:28,281
WAS SOME SORT OF CONNECTION. 

3142
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:32,052
I THINK THAT WILL COME TO LIGHT 

3143
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:33,119
AS THIS INVESTIGATION 

3144
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:34,788
PROGRESSES. 

3145
01:46:34,788 --> 01:46:38,291
ME THE DOCTOR SAID TO THE 

3146
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:39,960
FACILITY, -- 

3147
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:44,664
>> TO THE DOCTOR, THEY ARE 

3148
01:46:44,664 --> 01:46:53,273
PATIENTS. 

3149
01:46:53,273 --> 01:46:55,208
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET THERE, 

3150
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:59,546
MIKE ASKED 9:20? 9:30? 

3151
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:02,616
>> IT WAS IN THE 9:00 HOUR. 

3152
01:47:02,616 --> 01:47:04,651
ONE NEW DEVELOP,  THE JOHN 

3153
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:05,952
HOPKINS BAYVIEW SHERIFF'S 

3154
01:47:05,952 --> 01:47:07,487
OFFICE  IS ASKING ANYONE WHO 

3155
01:47:07,487 --> 01:47:08,088
WAS STILL INSIDE THESE 

3156
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:10,724
BUILDINGS HERE TO DIAL 911 SO 

3157
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:14,627
THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. 

3158
01:47:14,627 --> 01:47:15,996
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE 

3159
01:47:15,996 --> 01:47:16,296
BUILDINGS. 

3160
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:17,164
I WILL REDO THE TWEET. 

3161
01:47:17,164 --> 01:47:19,599
AT THIS TIME THE HARFORD COUNTY 

3162
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:20,934
SHERIFF'S OFFICE WOULD ASK 

3163
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:22,335
ANYONE THAT MAY STILL BE IN THE 

3164
01:47:22,335 --> 01:47:25,672
BUILDING TO DIAL 911 SO DEPUTIES

3165
01:47:25,672 --> 01:47:28,308
CAN LOCATE YOU. 

3166
01:47:28,308 --> 01:47:30,176
STILL, A LOT OF POLICE ARE ON 

3167
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,444
THE SCENE. 

3168
01:47:31,444 --> 01:47:32,878
THEY ARE EARLY IN THE 

3169
01:47:32,878 --> 01:47:33,880
INVESTIGATION. 

3170
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,115
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT 

3171
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:37,284
BUILDING TO GIVE THE ALL CLEAR 

3172
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:39,585
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THERE IS NO 

3173
01:47:39,585 --> 01:47:41,688
THREAT ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF 

3174
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:44,057
HERE. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

3175
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:45,458
EVERY INCH OF THAT BUILDING. 

3176
01:47:45,458 --> 01:47:46,693
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN 

3177
01:47:46,693 --> 01:47:50,196
THEM DO IN THIS VERY COUNTY, 

3178
01:47:50,196 --> 01:47:53,433
AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS. WE TALKED 

3179
01:47:53,433 --> 01:47:54,935
ABOUT BULLETPROOF VESTS AT THE 

3180
01:47:54,935 --> 01:47:55,201
HOSPITAL. 

3181
01:47:55,201 --> 01:47:58,471
YOU HEARD THE ONE QUESTION WAS 

3182
01:47:58,471 --> 01:48:00,874
-- WAS THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER 

3183
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:05,378
TAKEN TO JOHN HOPKINS BAYVIEW ? 

3184
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:06,746
THE DOCTOR WOULD NOT ANSWER 

3185
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,648
THAT QUESTION. 

3186
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:09,649
HE WOULD NOT PROVIDE THAT 

3187
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:09,982
INFORMATION. 

3188
01:48:09,982 --> 01:48:12,685
WE DO KNOW THAT THE SUSPECT WAS 

3189
01:48:12,685 --> 01:48:17,357
CRITICALLY INJURED. LEASE 

3190
01:48:17,357 --> 01:48:19,493
DIDN'T FIRE THE BULLET THEY 

3191
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:19,793
SAY. 

3192
01:48:19,793 --> 01:48:21,361
BUT THE SUSPECT WAS CRITICALLY 

3193
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:22,028
INJURED. 

3194
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:24,063
HE OR SHE WAS TAKEN TO A 

3195
01:48:24,063 --> 01:48:26,132
HOSPITAL. 

3196
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:27,133
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT 

3197
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:28,068
SUSPECT IS AT THIS POINT. 

3198
01:48:28,068 --> 01:48:29,736
WE DON'T KNOW IF POLICE HAVE 

3199
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:32,405
BEEN ABLE TO AT THIS POINT 

3200
01:48:32,405 --> 01:48:32,938
INTERVIEWED THE SUSPECT. 

3201
01:48:32,938 --> 01:48:35,675
BUT WE DID SPEAK TO SOME 

3202
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:38,645
CIVILIAN PEOPLE OUT HERE AT THE 

3203
01:48:38,645 --> 01:48:41,514
SCENE ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN.

3204
01:48:41,514 --> 01:48:43,183
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THAT 

3205
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:43,750
RIGHT NOW. 

3206
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,485
>> IT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

3207
01:48:45,485 --> 01:48:47,420
ALL THE ROADS ARE CUT OFF. 

3208
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:50,724
THEY ARE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO 

3209
01:48:50,724 --> 01:48:52,192
LET CARS DOWN HERE. 

3210
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:53,793
THEY ARE JUST USING ANY LARGER 

3211
01:48:53,793 --> 01:48:56,630
VEHICLES -- THEY ARE TELLING 

3212
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,032
SOME PEOPLE TO DIVERT THROUGH 

3213
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:01,668
THE GRAVEYARD, SOMEWHAT. 

3214
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:02,502
THERE ARE SO MANY CARS. 

3215
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:04,303
I THINK I COUNTED AT LEAST 13 

3216
01:49:04,303 --> 01:49:05,905
AMBULANCES. 

3217
01:49:05,905 --> 01:49:08,108
THAT WAS JUST WHEN I WAS 

3218
01:49:08,108 --> 01:49:08,742
COUNTING. 

3219
01:49:08,742 --> 01:49:12,946
AND A LOT OF VEHICLES, THEY ARE 

3220
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:17,017
STILL LOOKING, INVESTIGATING. 

3221
01:49:17,017 --> 01:49:19,385
>> Reporter: THAT WAS EARLIER 

3222
01:49:19,385 --> 01:49:20,520
TODAY. 

3223
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,522
WE HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE ARE 

3224
01:49:22,522 --> 01:49:23,790
STILL SOME ROADS BLOCKED OFF 

3225
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:25,759
HERE IN FRONT OF THIS 

3226
01:49:25,759 --> 01:49:27,894
DISTRIBUTION CENTER. 

3227
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:29,895
YOU CAN SEE THERE IS STILL A 

3228
01:49:29,895 --> 01:49:32,365
LARGE POLICE PRESENCE OUT HERE 

3229
01:49:32,365 --> 01:49:33,299

3234
01:49:39,873 --> 01:49:41,641
NOW WE ARE SEEING ANOTHER EMPTY 

3235
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:43,677
HARFORD COUNTY  SCHOOL BUS 

3236
01:49:43,677 --> 01:49:46,212
GOING BACK TO THE SCENE. 

3237
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:47,747
EARLIER WE SAW THREE SCHOOL 

3238
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:48,581
BUSES THAT WERE BROUGHT IN 

3239
01:49:48,581 --> 01:49:48,882

IT APPEARS THAT THEY ARE STILL 

3251
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:13,940
TRYING TO CLEAR THIS BUILDING 

3252
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:16,476
AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO 

3253
01:50:16,476 --> 01:50:18,545
ONE INSIDE. 

3254
01:50:18,545 --> 01:50:19,846
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE 

3255
01:50:19,846 --> 01:50:22,482
SURE THAT ANY CIVILIANS ARE OUT

3256
01:50:22,482 --> 01:50:24,517
. THAT IS ANOTHER ASPECT OF 

3257
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:26,620
MAKING SURE THE SCENE IS 

3258
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,353
TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL HERE. 

3259
01:50:27,353 --> 01:50:30,690
AS YOU HEARD FROM THAT WITNESS 

3260
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:32,592
ON THE SCENE, IT IS JUST A 

3261
01:50:32,592 --> 01:50:34,794
CHAOTIC SITUATION. 

3262
01:50:34,794 --> 01:50:36,929
AND SOMETHING THAT IS SUCH A 

3263
01:50:36,929 --> 01:50:38,565
QUIET AREA AND YOU DON'T EXPECT 

3264
01:50:38,565 --> 01:50:38,731
IT. 

3265
01:50:38,731 --> 01:50:40,233
AND SADLY WE HAVE SEEN OTHER 

3266
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:42,001
