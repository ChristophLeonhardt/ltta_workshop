A COUPLE OF FAKE SIGNS WERE
POPPING UP IN MINNEAPOLIS.
THEY
WERE ESSENTIALLY WARNING THE
RESIDENTS OF THE AREA OF HOW
POLICE ARE EASILY STARTLED.
THIS
IS A RESPONSE TO THE SHOOTING
DEATH OF JUSTINE DAMOND, AND A
STRONG WOMAN LIVING IN THE AREA.
SHE CALLED THE COPS TO REPORT AN
ASSAULT, THE COP SHOW UP AND SHE
APPROACHES THE VEHICLE, ONE OF
THE COPS WAS STARTLED AND SHOT
HER.
SHE DIED AS A RESULT.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UP IN ARMS AND
EXTREMELY ANGRY.
SOMEONE TOOK
MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND
MADE A POLITICAL STATEMENT BY
PUTTING UP THESE SIGNS WHICH
HAVE SINCE BEEN TAKEN DOWN.
IT
IS A FORM OF POLITICAL SPEECH I
CAN GET BEHIND.
>> REMEMBER ALSO FROM THE SAME
AREA PHILANDO CASTILE WAS SHOT.
IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE AN OFFICER
WAS STARTLED.
WERE PEOPLE AS
ANGRY ABOUT THAT?
ONLY A CERTAIN
PERCENTAGE.
I WISH PEOPLE WERE
JUST AS UPSET AND WANT TO JUST
AS MUCH CHANGE WHEN IT HAPPENED
TO PHILANDO CASTILE.
MOST PEOPLE
IN THE AREA ARE BEGINNING TO
REALIZE IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO
TRAIN POLICE THAT IF YOU HAVE 1%
CHANCE OF HAVING ANY KIND OF
HARM DONE TO YOU, JUST SHOOT AND
KILL 
THE PERSON.
THE MAIN THING
IS THE TRAINING.
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS ONE
THING, I THINK IT IS A
COMBINATION OF FACTORS.
ONE OF
THOSE FACTORS IS OF COURSE THE
TRAINING.
ANOTHER FACTOR IS THE
RESPONSE THE COMMUNITY HAS HAD
IN REGARD TO SOME OF THESE
SHOOTINGS.
THE MESSAGING HAS
BEEN IF A COP FEARS FOR HIS LIFE
FOR EVEN A SINGLE SECOND, THEY
HAVE THE RIGHT TO SHOOT, EVEN IF
THAT PERSON WAS NOT A THREAT OR
UNARMED.
TIME AGAIN COPS HAVE
BEEN GIVEN A PASS WHEN THIS
EXACT SAME THING HAPPENS.
IT
SENDS THE MESSAGING THAT YOU CAN
BE CARELESS.
ALL YOU DO IS STATE
YOU FEAR FOR YOUR LIFE AND THE
GRAND JURY WILL NOT AND THAT
YOU.
THE COMMUNITY WILL STAND
BEHIND YOU BECAUSE BEING A COP
IS A HARD THING.
BUT NOW ALL OF
A SUDDEN BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
IMPACTING ONE DEMOGRAPHIC,
PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS AND
CONCERNED AND WANT ANSWERS.
WE
SHOULD'VE DONE THAT FROM THE
BEGINNING WHEN THIS PATTERN
WAS APPARENT.
>> LOOK, I MIGHT MAKE A
PREDICTION AHEAD OF TIME.
THIS
COP WILL FACE CONSEQUENCES
BECAUSE HE SHOT A WHITE WOMAN.
IF IT WAS A BLACK COP SHOOTING A
WHITE WOMAN, EVERYONE IS UPSET,
AND HE IS IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE.
NO MATTER WHAT THE RACE OF
THE COP IS, IF HE SHOOTS A BLACK
GUY, OF COURSE YOU ARE IN
DANGER.
IN THIS CASE THE
PROSECUTOR, THE COMMUNITY, AND
THE JURY WILL THINK HOW
CAN HE BE IN DANGER?
IT IS AN INNOCENT WHITE WOMAN.
>>THE MAYOR HAS COME OUT AND HAS
BEEN CRITICAL OF WHAT OCCURRED.
TO THE POINT THE SHERIFF STEPPED
DOWN.
OR THE POLICE CHIEF
ACTUALLY.
WHAT HAVE WE EVER
COVERED THE STORY OF AN UNARMED
PERSON GETTING SHOT AND KILLED
AND THEN A POLICE CHIEF SAYING I
MUST STOP I WILL STEP DOWN.
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ANY
OF THE RACIAL STUFF.
THERE ARE
TWO
THINGS WE NEED TO FIX, FIX THE
TRAINING, AND FIX WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER THE SHOOTING.
IF YOU TEACH
THEM TO SHOOT IMMEDIATELY AND
SAY THERE WILL NOT BE
CONSEQUENCES, OF COURSE IT WILL
BE THIS RESULT.
DID YOU KNOW IT
IS ACTUALLY A HEALTH PROBLEM AND
NOT A CRIME PROBLEM?
GREAT.
IF
IT IS GOING TOWARDS A FIX THANK
YOU FOR ALL JOINING THE MOVEMENT
LET'S GET CRIMINAL JUSTICE
REFORM AND MAKE SURE THAT IF
THERE IS A COP SHOOTING NOT THAT
THEY ARE PROSECUTED, BUT THAT AN
INDEPENDENT FEDERAL
INVESTIGATION HAPPENS.
AND
REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED
TO PROTECT US, THAT IS THEIR JOB
SO THEY SHOULD BE MORE
CAREFUL THAN THEY ARE BECAUSE
NOW THEY ARE SHOOTING EVERYBODY.
