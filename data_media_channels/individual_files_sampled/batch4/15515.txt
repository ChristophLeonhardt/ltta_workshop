political campaigns are targeting you on Facebook help us find out how CBC News is partnering with ProPublica to track Canadian political ads on the social media platform ProPublica hey I'll tell you a bit more about them in a moment but here's what they want you to do by installing a browser extension called Facebook political ad collector developed by Pro Publica CBC readers can help journalists get a better picture of the scope of political ads that Facebook users across Canada are seeing oh really that information will be fed into a database of political ads that can be analyzed by CBC and other news organizations and help us dig up and research news stories the information in the database is crowd-sourced so the more people who use the extension the more entries will appear in the database and the more news story CBC will be able to tell so sir what stories Facebook already discloses all of its political ads that that's a change they recently made you can see who's paying for an ad that targets you you can even see why you received it for example Facebook will tell you what attributes you have that made you a target even in the CBC's pitch to get you to download their spyware they'll show you that the political database will also include the targeting information then Facebook users see when they click on why am I seeing this under the three dots in the top right corner of sponsored posts so it's right there that you already know everything so let's recap here Facebook already identifies who is paying for an ad that targets you already explains why you're being targeted an example the CBC uses is an ad by Kathleen Wynne targeting people 22 years old up who care about minimum wage so that's out there already Facebook has more disclosures than that soups I'm not defending Facebook in any way I think they're awful and they break the law I think and they're censors I know but my only point here is what is this CBC app do that isn't already done well nothing really other than hand over your information to a third party group a New York left-wing lobby called ProPublica isn't that odd the CBC itself gets 1.5 billion dollars a year from taxpayers but they couldn't make their own app they allowed a New York lobby group to do it and to get your data and to keep it they keep your data even after you deactivate the app they'll keep your data forever that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
