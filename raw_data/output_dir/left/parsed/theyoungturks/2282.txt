FACEBOOK WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
THAT IT RAN A CERTAIN SURVEY
ASKING IF MEN SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO REQUEST SEXUAL PICTURES
FROM UNDER AGED GIRLS.
JONATHAN HAYNES IS THE STORY THE
STARTS WITH.
HE IS A DIGITAL EDITOR AT THE
GUARDIAN AND WAS ON
FACEBOOK AND GOT THIS POP UP.
AND HERE WAS THE QUESTION HE WAS
FACED WITH.
>>THE LAST ONE IS MY FAVORITE.
GROWN MEN LOOKING AT SEXUAL
PICTURES OF 14-YEAR-OLD
GIRLS, I HAVE NO PREFERENCE ON
THAT TOPIC.
>> HE ASKED THIS DIGITAL EDITOR
IS MAKING IT SECRET THE
BEST FACEBOOK CAN OFFER HERE?
NOT CALLING THE POLICE.
CITY LAWS FIGURE HERE AS
BEING QUITE IMPORTANT ON
DETERMINING ROLES?
>>FACEBOOK DOES NOT DENY THIS
WAS A SURVEY.
THEY SAY YES IT WAS, IT WAS A
MISTAKE AND WE WILL PULL IT
DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WERE DOING
IT.
I WILL TELL YOU FACEBOOK IS A
PARTNER OF OURS, SO I AM
JUST KEEPING IT REAL.
YOU HOPE IT WAS SOME SORT OF
THING LIKE IF YOU ANSWERED
YES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT,
BUT IT WAS THEN REPORTED TO
THE AUTHORITIES.
BY THE WAY I'M NOT SURE THEY
SHOULD DO THAT EITHER.
BUT MY POINT BEING IS THERE
MIGHT'VE BEEN ANOTHER
REASON, BUT IF THERE IS THEY
SHOULD SHARE BECAUSE IT
LOOKS REALLY BAD.
>>HERE IS WHAT I THINK IS
HAPPENING.
YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE ñ IT GOES
INTO ITALICS AFTER THE : IN
THE QUESTION.
I AM ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT
THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY
QUESTIONS THEY ARE ASKED ON
SURVEYS.
THEY ARE JUST COLLECTING DATA ON
HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE THIS ISSUE.
AND THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING
THAT WE CAN REALLY CONCLUDE
FROM THAT DATA, BUT THEY ARE
JUST GATHERING IT.
IF I AM CHOOSING WHICH DATA
COLLECTION PRACTICE FACEBOOK
DOES, I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE
ONE FOR ME.
I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE
CREEPY STUFF IN GOOGLE.
THAT IS THE MORE DATA ENTRY
HERE, THE JOKE RESPONSE I HAD TO
IT YOU KNOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE
SO MUCH IS UNCERTAIN AS TO
HOW PEOPLE FEEL.
MAYBE FACEBOOK WAS LIKE AS CHILD
PORN STILL WEIRD TO PEOPLE?
HOPEFULLY YOU WILL SAY IT IS
BAD.
>>AND FACEBOOK MIGHT ALSO ñ
THEY ARE DEALING WITH HUMANITY
HERE AS WE ALL ARE ON THE
INTERNET.
WHAT I MEAN IS THE INTERNET
ALLOWS FOR MORE UNVARNISHED SIDE
OF HUMANITY.
THE INTERNET ALSO ALLOWS FOR
WONDERFUL THINGS TO HAPPEN.
FACEBOOK, DEALING WITH ALL THIS
INCOMING MADNESS OF THE ID
OF HUMANITY, MAYBE IT IS TRYING
TO SORT IT OUT.
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK IS
ACCEPTABLE AND NOT.
WHAT ARE THE COLORS?
>>CHILD GROOMING ON FACEBOOK.
THEY REGULARLY WORK WITH THE
POLICE TO MAKE SURE ANYONE
ACTING IN SUCH A WAY IS BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE.
>>AND IT IS ILLEGAL, RIGHT?
HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT, IT WAS
DEFINITELY A MISTAKE.
IF SOMEONE WERE TO HIRE SOMEONE
ELSE ON FACEBOOK TO ASSASSINATE
YOUR WIFE, WOULD THAT BE
ACCEPTABLE AND HOW MUCH?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, THAT IS
CRAZY.
>>AND THEY ARE VERY LEGALISTIC.
YOU CAN SEE THE LEGAL FRAMINGS
OF ALL THESE OPTIONS.
AND IF YOU LOOK AT SEX
TRAFFICKING LAWS THAT PROTECT
FORUMS FROM PROSECUTION AND
BACKPAGE AND FACEBOOK FALLS
UNDER THIS, ALSO CRAIGSLIST
WHERE IT IS THIS WEIRD ARCHAIC
VERSION OF PROTECTING FORUMS.
THEY ARE LEGLESS AND, WE ARE
LIKE THE PHONE COMPANY.
YOU DON'T GET MAD AT THE PHONE
COMPANY WHEN SOMEONE MAKES
A CALL TO WHAT HITMAN?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET MAD AT
FACEBOOK WHEN SOMEONE ASKED
FOR A CHILD PORN PICTURE RIGHT?
YOU'RE GOING TO GO AFTER THE
PERSON WHO ASKED FOR THE
PICTURE.
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT BUILT
INTO THIS THAT I CAN SEE
FROM THE DIFFERENT WAYS IT IS
PUT.
THAT AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE
FAKE NEWS EPIDEMIC WHEN FACEBOOK
IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
DO PEOPLE WANT TO SEE?
AND HOW MUCH OF THEIR AGAINST
WHAT WE ARE ALREADY DOING.
AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES YOU
SEE THINGS THAT END UP LIKE
THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING
TO FIND A TECHNOLOGICAL
SOLUTION TO SOMETHING THAT
REQUIRES A LOT OF EMOTIONAL
INTELLIGENCE TO FIGURE OUT.
