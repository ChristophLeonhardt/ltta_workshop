in Congress Axios this reporting Ryan has told confidence that he will announce soon that he will not be running for re-election in November that report is citing sources with knowledge of the conversations Axios adds that after Ryan passed tax reform his longtime goal in Congress he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating in part because of President Trump joining us now on the phone national political reporter for Axios Jonathan Swan who just broke this story Jonathan what else can you tell us how did this go down I can tell you that Paul Ryan is going is planning to tell colleagues today that he's not going to run for re-election in November this decision has been long rumored but it's been kept extremely closely Paul Ryan told a few a very small group of confidants last night and he plans to tell the staff this morning and his colleagues today so we just broke that on access a few minutes ago hey Jonathan it's Willie what's behind this decision as you said this has sort of been out there for a while it was reported back in December and then the speaker had to come out and refute that story right what drives his decision here well talking to friends of his and people who've worked with him for a long time look Paul Ryan's driving goal ever since he joined Congress was to reform the tax code was to pass tax cuts tax reform and he very much saw that as a crowning achievement when they passed it he didn't want that job as Speaker it's actually not a very pleasant job he's got to contend with an unruly GOP conference he's got the freedom caucus who are constantly trying to knife him and you know they're staring down the barrel frankly of potentially losing the house in November so I don't know that Paul Ryan Minority Leader is a particularly appealing title so I think a lot of those factors came into play he's still very young so he may end up coming back to politics at some point but this has been long in the work how much of this how much of this Jonathan is about President Trump obviously there's a prospect of losing the house this fall but also you cover the hill you know well we've watched speaker Ryan come out time and again maybe out of the gym or just to show up from work and be asked about a tweet from President Trump and be expected to take a stand on it every day there's something else is he exhausted by the president I don't know that that's played a huge role in the decision I think he certainly it's no mystery that those two have never really bonded they're incredibly different in terms of personality in terms of their policy priorities and at different times they've been at war but look I think that a lot of other factors have played into it and again it's an unmanageable conference running that Republican conference is almost an impossible job you don't really have a unified party you've got a bunch of conservative very conservative House members who have really been actively plotting to get rid of Paul Ryan so his daily job is made incredibly difficult I wonder do you know if he is planning to make this a public announcement with your statement or is the filter out of his office I don't know their plan for the rollout I suspect that we spoiled they roll out somehow but look it's it's very small group of people who knew about this so you know people on his staff who didn't know about it this morning oh my gosh okay Axios is Jonathan Swan thank you very much keep us posted call I'm trying to figure out where you are as you're talking to us on the phone I think he's like getting out of this apartment and putting his tie on speaking of putting his tie on Joe what's your gut Paul Ryan announcing at this point that he's he hasn't announced it but he's going to say today that he is not running again he's done well you know as we said before mica I guess earlier this week when we were talking about the possibility of Paul Ryan making this announcement in the coming days or weeks this is a job that he had to be pushed into he had been he'd gotten the the job of his life at least his public life when he when he became chairman of the Ways and Means Committee he's always been focused from you know the time I first met him when he was in his early 20s and then when I went out and campaigned for him in Janesville in 1998 which really wasn't seen as a swing district then Paul Ryan was focused on taxes he is used a Kemp protege he wanted to pass a sweeping piece of tax legislation that looked a lot like the bill that was passed earlier this year and for a guy who struggled with coming back into the fray and being Speaker of the House complaining privately at the time that it would mean that he would spend too much time away from his children too much time away from his wife too much time away from his home in Jane Janesville Wisconsin this is not really much of a surprise I am sure if Paul Ryan had known that taking the speakership would require him to have to deal with a president like Donald J Trump he would have never taken that position in the first place so I said I suspect you know there's there's a lot of relief for Paul for his wife and for his family so we'll see what he has to say later today when he officially announces this thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to
