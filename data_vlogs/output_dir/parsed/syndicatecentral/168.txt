Jordan Sunday yeah yeah this is the
first I was in your first podcast first
poor GP yeah first 4gt podcast and then
he's in the first the first I should
call it day in the life of someone day

really call it a no life or Ford GT coz
look at it absolutely beautiful
don't you let me in but it is the day in
the life of Jordan today and we're gonna
go now where we are now I like this idea
because then that way of Labor idea yeah
no no no totally yeah I hit him off
about it but I really like the idea of
doing a Dana life of someone like
whether it's like another youtuber
because I'm not so lightweight to calab
but then the same time it's like yeah
it's like a way for me till I reach out
to different people in different
industries where these musicians like I
don't like jaws a musician and stuff
like the DJ he's epic I'd love to go and
spend a day like hangar I goes with him
really not being really I mean really
cool to like go up on stage yeah I like
before the show yeah yeah so it's like
the life of Tom but in the day in the
life of someone else I really like that

life of John it is pretty good so far
pretty damn good to probably usually end
up doing a little bit more work and
you'll see here yesterday I said Rodeo
Drive is where everyone goes with a
local cars if you want to show off the
cars and the money and all that I don't
have a car but he does so he doesn't
want to do it but I'm gonna make it
happen
I have purposefully avoided going on
Rodeo Drive because it's just like it is
you don't move you're just going ten
miles an hour and you can take all there
is no reason to be on Rodeo Drive unless
you're trying to find a parking spot to
go to one of the top ten Chaka Khan so
because I want to show up for Jordans
Cobb will go in turn or dare drive yeah
there are actually people who will yes
we are no look look your car in the
reflection even though that there's like
a mirror that's fucking it up that's
what I want to get a shot of like a
perfect picture of your Karen or might
be shopping that police is now young and
Russ Oh
definitely not after us welcome to rodeo
drat
oh my god oh dude look at this is why
people come in with their cars I hate
doing this oh my God look at Rolly
dude nah man there will never be a time
in my life where I get to come back down
Rodeo Drive

right now it's just own it just own it
decide start winking to people lick your
lips let your lips are people what's the
word like article Oh Lexi look this guy
likes it you're advertising it before I
know but this is meant for a tray not to
just roll everybody drives around the
Hollywood Hills all right so I'm coming
me like that so like 300 of these cars
in the world these people deserve to
take photos long everyone's got their
cameras out bro yeah oh there's a gold

that's stock paint job very nicely
how was it how was it for you it was
great it was exactly I expected okay
Oh actors cameras next album coming back
in an f-type SVR I'm gonna drive you
down at my oh my god do me like that
John if I gotta do me like that it's
just a thing of like this he's in a
vehicle where there's only 350 of them
in the world not showing off but it's
not showing off like what I'm trying to
say no it's people just deserve to see
this car sure
cuz he's so goddamn beautiful again so
John just educated me something about
this Karen for the most witches is a
diplomat played him constantly which if
this guy crashed into us basically
nothing these place apparently mean that
I'm not too sure why but Jordan just
educated our faces I even realized that
was the part of it that was gonna pop up
I was just explaining that he needs to
plug it in because it's got a really
small battery life they recommend it if
you're not gonna drive it for two days
okay plug it in I know this is something
that I think I saw overlooked every time
I look at this car but those lights

so so beautiful and I'm very happy for
you

you'll be able to get a full 135 a deuce
in Ramstein okay okay hey this is just
like paper

think you'll be fine
good
go down a little further you're not
quite horizontal there you go
that's better
roll we're doing a little bit of this
like worm cutting or movement try to
keep your back keep your abs tight and
that'll allow you to keep your abs tight
there you go okay stas update it is
exhausting
I'd have only doing 20 20 Oh
okay is this like doing push-ups - yeah
I like how you're talking at the same
time yeah oh yeah so this is this is
1:15 I can tell you right now for a fact
my legs I thought I thought like coz of
cycling I know I ride an electric bike
but it's a lot of weight I'm training I
thought my legs would be like the last
thing I feel very different cardio makes
you lose muscle dude like I can feel I
can feel it there
so just take it easy Center the bar walk
it off slowly and make sure you're
getting your depth
keep your abs tight you spread your feet
a little more there you go yep
good depth good depth
keep your keep your abs tight you're
doing a little bit of like sandwich
movement at the bottom okay you do one
more
oh yeah okay oh that's some depth right
there that's what element on one long
time ago if you don't want to feel you
need no no I can definitely tell you now
when I went down not time then I didn't
actually know if I would ever go like
she'll try again and that's why you
gotta be polite here yeah like that I
could feel like it felt my leg was going
inwards a bit and I've always had like a
kind of a weak left knee okay it's
always been good so I don't forget all
right
Buffy this I feels good but even when
you said you went oh that was a lot of
death I was like trying to get my foot
that okay if you ever get into an issue
you can bail let me know and I can
don't drop it but you can just go down
all the way and bail there yeah or just
let me know I don't think it that way I
know it's sucks book the last thing I
want to be doing if you guys move when I
was in Paris awaits me limping around
and if you'd be a lot of a bitch
I'll take it I'll take me Carnival
Facebook I was like limping for like
three weeks straight until I got caught
a zone injection in my knee so I'm not
about trying to fuck that up
I couldn't go it's a demon he's not even
breaking a sweat in his spandex I'm
hoping this'll work
Jordan thought mine but the most I'll be
able to do is walk 35 maybe say for one
I don't think I'm gonna get one off
you're
yeah I look forward to bench cuz I feel
like I can push myself like and really
like not be able to move it foot lose my
leg I'd rather be able to walk for the
next month just say alright what your
refuge by how much weight to 45 to 25
here he goes you big boy
maybe look at these shoulders just like
a thunder

balancing because yeah naturally you're
kind of gonna get but you're fine

focus on keeping it stable
I don't read look of other loves keep
you're going down a little quickly be
more methodical there you go
because you want to keep it stable not
wild

feel like I'm wrong I feel like a weapon
off my ass shoes I know that sounds
great but like I get it like cuz I'm
feel like a robot
ah it takes I've gotta use you have a
feeling we're getting used to fine
Google I'd like to break 100 book okay
all right 95 yeah I set you're right
you're a little too far come forward a
little bit okay you start feeling like
it's heavy I just I would normally spot
you back there but since I'm dying up
straight really fine
nice
good boy
did you like that little white waffle I
about for every pushup
it's natural because there are little
stabilizer muscles you're not used to
yeah I didn't touch them I have been
counting

doing it smoother do not feel bad that
was good and your personal best again

did ten I'll be one
easy mode Jordan right now that was a
struggle bus for me but he's about to
hit 135 oh this is an adult starting but
just yarded said mate you need some
squats in a bit Jesus Christ
go online oh boy
see a little bit of color in your face I
like that it because this is an adult
exercise and all was a small man child
watch that you want to keep it straight
up over here you don't want it over your
eyes okay oh yeah that's like perfectly
over your nipples Jesus Christ John and
go online got it bro well done
this is 135 I'm gonna try it again I
only my to do to rest a bit earlier and
I'm pretty exhausted well let's see look

I've never done wait
I John is a really good teacher 2:45 Oh

with two reps on 135 does it this is
what I like 12-month the pure just
eating good
exercising well does for you get it like
thanks
good job dude will help doing my dude
just for the record I did offer to spot
him even though I probably want to save
his life I did officer don't it yeah
yeah don't think I'm being rude here
like filming it I do you offer
so yeah so okay so what you saying is
because I'm like well bit all over the
place on this and cuz it's like yeah if
I go and do it over there
I might bail I should be able to oh damn
oh my god you can't just do what he does
ten thank you babe
yeah I don't think I can do that so
Jordans doing wait what
180 yeah oh my god okay so he's doing
180 ten of these and after he's done ten
of these 15 push-ups and then into these
raised push-ups 15 of them the one thing
he does the push-ups like this tight I'm
used to like bowing my arms out and
breathe see if I can hit that oh shit
you'll be fine just don't let the weight
pull you forward keep it nice yeah
you did ten you're good
let's straight into the push-ups it's
the way you'll do that technique you
want me to do I don't think I ought to
do it your yeah your elbows flare out
yeah you don't have to stop that like I
don't even know if right yeah
brain make your hands more straight
forward and elbows to your sides
I've never do push-ups on you ready
that's the correct form there you go I
could do 20 fresh tips I think like that
is so let you sort that I can't my mind
even like I can't do it I know this is
like an odd clarification but when I
usually work out before I go to bed at
night I do like 40 push-ups just my own
white bodyweight like 40 push-ups but I
do the push-ups like you know out with
the arms like out to the side not the
arm by your side like that so when
Jordan was teaching me how to do that
that's why physically I just couldn't do
it I can do push-ups but I don't
remember it's a British push-up or it's
just completely the wrong pusher but ya
know just kind of fight I can do
push-ups very capable they were and
pull-ups but the weight Jordan does them
there's it's just not possible I could
not do one but I'm just hanging out 200
like it's nothing
go on Jesus chest fart like yeah keep
your abs tight
you don't need to go all the way back in
hit say go Johnny you don't need to hit
why did you say that that was five
yeah that's RIT that light now just
extend your legs a little bit does it
bring you further away you start close
to you oh yeah oh okay that was that was
10 10 minute 10 ish
about 1/4 I don't get it
Jota thinks he can do six of these 220
220 going Jordan I'm sticking out
traps wall get him Jordan goal not keep
her going ten five more let's go go on
four more yes oh well played
yeah others yeah yeah well then I
literally just joke like oh look at my
finger is such a hot day at the gym and
then I saw Jordans this is what mine
look like this is what Jordans look like
it's really bad I'm gonna take me for a
massage yeah exfoliate good
all right so it's just a test me yeah
see how it feels
trying to keep your book there you go
how's that feel fine then we go out

first time with 70 and I skip to 85 but

got to control it all the way
you can definitely tell which I may use
more why keep going
he's keeping straight no little bet oh
really yeah
cool good I definitely like his
exercises I feel like that's what I want
to do like I just feels like what I'm
used to
yeah I know that that's the whole part
using all the muscles that you haven't
used by doing them push-ups dude might
look like they're doing that they're
doing their push-ups I just couldn't do
it
you find time in practice time for
Jordan to do 6,000 Jonah's gonna do 220
now and do ten and then ten and I'm
gonna try and do one yeah the one you
have muscles on your muscles you are a
muscle Jordan you are literally a muscle
seeing if we can move it is you have to
pick one that's the whole idea
did what one year's practice one days I
know but that's the whole yeah that's a
lotta dude a day in the life of Jordan I
commented easy in comparison
I got this wait now keep going down what
go down what it let's see you that's why

yeah we're definitely on the final
stretch here brother your last mentally
I am there but I never on my body I
would any chance of into a gym or just a
workout never above I bought it just
been like well welcome to being with a
personal trainer
I change it up keep it up keep your form
Hey okay you're done yeah I was like you
like fun like no because you know yeah I
need to I need to move off the shoulders
because I'm not about to be free we
wonder have I be playing for not like
this I feel like I'm popping out of my
chest right now like I said I feel like
I feel like I look like Jordan right
look in the eye
I feel like I'm just like so fucking
cute right now you got a good baseline
to start with you could be ripped
I like Tommy ramen noodles to go welcome
to the high piss room in the entire gym
this is spinning classes which if you've
never seen these this is like super
stupidly high endurance
loud music pedal but my dad it like this
no my dad gay Tony but this is all ABS
because I'm like John and I can't laugh
in it in my arms anymore I'm Ben so this
is what we're gonna be doing just on
your knees to elbows straight back your
arms are just being used to hold it but
they're not doing any move
I think you're at 15 all right it's so
nice to not using my arms I'm telling
you bro like you'd probably go up here
ya know what that felt actually super
easy nothing on the shoulders which is
good I feel like I got concrete slots up
my shoulders all right this one looks
like it's gonna you think it's gonna be
arms but it's more half you're gonna
need to go down let's start off with ya
so I thought just like the men want to
keep your keep everything nice and tight
no no bend your arm ah
all right now you have got it
there you go
feel that in my spine you
oh shit
you want to keep your abs tight
installed yeah yeah holy shucks
sup muscle your your spine erect er so
it's called okay yeah
alright now the other side remember that
foot position now
don't let it Dirk you at the end keep it
nice and smooth all time there you go
I doubt you're saying
yeah yeah thank you you're a good
teacher though you didn't you didn't
give up on me so thank you honest to God
if I would've kept doing that today
I honestly think I would have damaged my
knees so bad because I've bent down on
my knee earlier on and it's an actual
pain and if there's one thing I don't
want its to hurt money again like I
thought I was gonna stop an operation on
that knee but I had to talk cortisone
injection in it so I'm not about doing
damage I'd say in the life of Jordan
ever done you did good
honestly I don't say this just because
we're on video and it's your vlog but of
all the people hanging here for like a
first go I know you've been doing before
you want any serious capacity the
highest weighs on everything and good
form good smell thank you very much yeah
honest to god this guy's look at the
fucking size of it it'd be so good to
like look like this to be like this for
like tell them straight like how much
time there did you put into this I try
to count like every day yeah boy sorry
the problem is the more you exercise the
more you crave food yeah so it's just
like a daily struggle trying to not eat
too much cuz yeah this is the heaviest
I've ever weighed is right now yeah when
I feel like before I was like a bit
unhealthy for a couple years not really
exercising
I hope YouTube a lot of stuff yeah yeah
it just really antsy to get into that
well either if you're watching this and
you want to get up and do some exercise
present exactly that life's too short
made most of it you don't wanna be on
your deathbed going wish I got the fit
wish I was healthy wish I was this it's
only up to you to do it and that's why I
ride my bike twice a week might be not
actually bike but it actually is a
workout who's doing something than
nothing so get at it get going and in
about 12 of time you look like this guy
gonna admit for the idea of a day in the
life with a like with someone Jordan was
a very good first first person well I'll
have to do though is like a day next
time where it's like the full day like
and then you know after this yet till
the end
yeah like I know it sounds weird but
because then it's like you get to
experience the full person's like true
true today we'll do on the class a sushi
for dinner dude yeah I probably need to
start working out a little bit more than
for when I'm next to her to come out
with him but honestly thank you very
much hospitality thank you for taking me
in your car like it's actually I mean
this like an honor because I'd not
everyone can go getting that sobbing so
I really really appreciate that yeah go
fuck yourself a breaking me yeah by the
way guys I won't like I said when he's a
podcast goes live I will share it with
you guys
Jonathan's telling me down in the
description is like covering cars like
absolutely crazy especially the Ford GT
so we know him everyone here on this
channel knows him so go show some love
go subscribe I can't say anything else
over that thank you very much I'm poking
at I'm just gonna sit here and cry like
this literally like this for the rest of
my day yeah it was it wasn't too long
before I told Jordan to come running
back for me because yeah I made the
mistake of leaving my wallet my passport
and my sunglasses in his car that was
short-lived how is it gonna get out the
country if you have a passport is the
trade okay alright yep
take two bye yep preciate it another
lovely day in Los Angeles I've got no
plans now because Jordans got plans well
for food we were just doing the drive
and then once wouldn't drive it was the
gym so with him plan actually to eat
together tonight so he's already got
some plans so I might be going to meet
you know with AJ we'll see how that goes
but you know what like that I did just
come up the idea of it just being like
oh I just want to spend the day with
Jordan and Karen in the gym that's what
I like to do but I really think we could
be onto a really cool really cool idea
like like some of your guys favorite
youtubers are like eyes magicians sports
people or something just like hang out
with them for a day what an awesome
series a day in the life I film on the
life of Tom so like join me on my
experience
Tom thank you very much interesting
letter to come home to nothing crazy but
apparently these bedbugs in the building
my apartment so thank God I never come
and go so there's no bed bugs that made
it into mine because I'm gonna buy
something and I know what pet bookbags
look like they can be pretty brutal man
but yeah apparently the buildings got
bedbugs so I'm going home to England
tomorrow therefore I don't get I know I
caught the Sun yesterday that's why my
head's all red in my all my arms and
stuff like that
not to burn but oh my god is my arm here
bird from where I've been saying Jordans
car and the Sun was on my arm so I now
have the weirdest sunburned arm in the
world if someone could help me move off
this sofa that'd be great my legs are
great thank God at bus
thank God I busted my knee cuz if I
wasn't able to walk not even because I
broke my knee but if I wasn't be able to
walk because my knees saw I'd be so sad
poor it's just my shoulder so just gonna
roll out of bed to go meet AJ so see in
a minute AJ I'll be there in a minute
the words that were about to come up my
mouth for then where I'm feeling fresher
ready to go no look brand new t-shirt
nice and clean nice black ski skinny
jeans keep you guys happy you keep Santa
wet boot cuts dead standard trainers but
I have a nose I have a bleeding nose not
a nose bleed for once I don't know how I
got that I've caught myself somehow God
because you know I was just working so
AJ's just racist and the reason why I
say it's racist because this dumb or
shunned honest which look books Victoria
because I'm pretty sure it's supposed to
be like a bird even though it sounds
Irish it's supposed to be a British
publicist so not a Ford GT sugar mouth
food drink Oh have been here before
I knew it I've been in that bar there
before and then I think we crossed over
to this one I knew I recognized this
area what a dope little spawn because
it's sunset I can't see the Sun from
here but oh the sky you open and the
seniors not again not too bad what
fucking time to call this what don't you
call this come come come come
all I'm saying is it's freezing cold
outside you seen that nipple
iceberg this feels so British right now
and I'm so happy still really sore we
got close out the table outside and
we're gonna eat some good food you gave
me oh yeah mmm
plot twist mean AJ took so long to get
here get drinks and then get ready for
food but the kitchens closed so no it
does it does those nuts too smart
thinking well either what up returning
to you laddies
twenty-one dollars for a frisky oh yeah
Oh after a big day the gym man I got my
plate of meter I'm ready for this this
is I feel like this is so American it
was like Texas America is this a British
bar an Irish I don't know I mean it'll
it mean literally neither okay I
actually feel like I'm having some like
proper home-cooked food rather than some
fancy la restaurant you know I need a
knife and fork one second so we have
brisket creamed corn or something like
that
mashed potatoes gravy and then like a
beet juice
Oh mate you found the salad bar okay
maybe I need some solid on this okay
that looks pretty good what did you go
for a dilly dilly do you get that
reference we doing yeah yeah but like
know this story like Luke is supposed to
be joining us today for drinks some
reason he didn't attend he's not join us
for food and he's texting me now going
like oh how long are you gonna be doing
like I want to watch the next episode of
Westworld so then I say to AJ is it a
home waiting to watch as West wolf do
you watch it this is no longer one of
their really good friends is an actress

actress like make this is nuts so

anyway oh my god the OLX ever as well
shout out to my boy he's not absolutely
home and I love him so much but dude
honest to god it's probably good job I
didn't come to Amsterdam I would have
found my doughnut for at least 12 hours

normal human being I have nothing else
to say ever then that was really good
food look at this plate so good did you

something
don't leaving tomorrow so I don't know
you can't what drive right cause peace
I'm gonna bed so ladies and gentlemen I
hope you enjoyed the vlog I hope you're
looking forward to the idea of a day in
the life of Tom featuring someone oh you
know like a day in the life of someone
featuring Tom you know like I think it's
such a good idea to like be able to
collaborate with like youtubers like
like adventure people like you know like
sports people youtubers big or small
like I think it's a really really cool
idea it's a brunch out to someone who
wants to like show me a day in their
life regardless of is wake up and just
cook all day are weaker but do nothing
holiday or wake up and do adventurous
shit to be fair what can I want to do
like adventurous shit but that way it's
like if there is small in channels out
there who literally do live a very
adventurous lifestyle whether it's like
hike you know mountain bike you know you
know fucking skydiving or like whatever
it is they have a tank driving for like
just you know the most random stuff ever
but like you know that
not like they're not featured out there
too much so like they want that
opportunity to be like this is what I do
like hello to me I think it's a cool way
to club or collaborate and I'm really
excited about I did and I think it could
be really cool but I'll think about it a
bit more think about maybe producing the
episodes a bit but like today's like
literally was just being me and Giada
and hanging out but it's really opened
my eyes to like this could be such a big
project and then it really like opens
the opportunity like you know to do cool
shit all around the world with the most
interesting people and then that way I
just get to share the most amazing stuff
with you guys on the journey that is the
life of Tom and I feel like today's been
the one vlog that I've really like been
focused to like film on film in like you
know be feel like I'm vlogging rather
than just like oh I found a second to
film my day like that's how it's felt
throughout the day so far so I'm really
really glad that I've had like a good
solid vlog today and I think that's the
case of just being surrounded by like
you know other youtubers cuz like it's I
love being around looking at all these
friends and all that I'm not the office
and stuff but none of them are youtubers
and like yeah Luke is in videos and he's
great on camera and everything like that
he's just great you just himself which
is perfect like literally couldn't ask
for anything more as a youtuber but like
you know like when other people a bit
like man what was going on like whereas
YouTube is like oh this is just common
common thing like so hanging out with
Giada and today was just perfect and I
think I definitely need to meet you know
what the home is a bit more from like
the YouTube scene and less like not less
less work since like not see my people
as much more like during the daytime
like find that space of going down to
the office going down to three be doing
the gaming shit but then also hanging
out with other people that like you know
we're just we know how each other works
oh so weird it's a weird one but like
you know I said like with the vlog I
definitely do try and keep you guys
involved in like how everything is the
conversation of it all and just keep it
open so thanks for watching I hope
you've enjoyed my la vlogs I am leaving
tomorrow you will get a full la vlog
tomorrow by the way I'm gonna go down to
the office again tomorrow my my entire
computer rooms probably been dismantled
already cuz I'm leaving on Monday guys
thanks for watching I've got a sunset on
the way and I'm so happy because I I
literally came out here for some time
Jordan's car and the Jim Jordan Jim
killed me so
middle finger to you the cow was amazing
so us harder to appreciate that and yeah
the Sun like as soon as this burn
disappears is gonna be a beautiful
suntan so what Los Angeles was six a
success successful trip such a
successful trip in LA and I'm like
really excited about that like yeah I
like I like my trips been shot and sweet
when they get dragged out a bit too much
like say if I'm back home in the UK for
like a month it just seems like too much
I'm out here for a month it just seems
like too much so I've got a kid I think
I've got to keep it like two weeks two
weeks even if I'm in the UK after two
weeks I've just got to go somewhere even
if it's for like a weekend chopping away
like down to London and hit up Joe and
everyone is here if they want to do
something I've got to make sure like
every two weeks I'm going somewhere
different so let's try and stick to that
yeah like I really really feel like I
need to do that for like my own mental
sanity so yeah thanks for watching this
