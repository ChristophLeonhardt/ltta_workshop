"WASHINGTON EXAMINER."

25
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:50,506
BYRON, YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE

26
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:52,508
SUMMIT AND THAT AGREEMENT THAT

27
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:53,442
WE JUST SHOWED THAT

28
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:54,910
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN

29
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,878
SIGNED?

30
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:56,846
>> I THINK THE MOST REASONABLE

31
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:58,848
ASSESSMENT YOU CAN MAKE IT IT IS

32
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:00,483
THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING

33
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,884
TO WORK OUT OR NOT.

34
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:02,685
IN THE JOINT AGREEMENT THAT THE

35
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:07,590
TWO LEADERS RELEASED, KIM

36
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,392
PLEDGED COMMITTED TO

37
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:12,461
DENUCLEARIZATION BUT PREVIOUS

38
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:13,362
LEADERS HAVE PLEDGED THE SAME

39
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,297
THING I'M NOT DONE IT, SO YOU

40
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:15,698
CAN'T SAY.

41
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:19,101
THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ISSUES.

42
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:20,670
TALK ABOUT THE U.S. MILITARY

43
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,437
EXERCISES, WHETHER THAT'S REALLY

44
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:24,073
A BIG CONCESSION OR NOT SINCE

45
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:26,308
TOM COTTON EARLIER ON THIS

46
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:26,976
PROGRAM SAID THE NEXT BIG

47
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:29,278
MILITARY EXERCISE IS NEXT

48
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:30,112
SPRING.

49
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,080
SO IF KIM IS OPERATING IN BAD

50
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,449
FAITH, WE WILL CERTAINLY KNOW

51
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:34,650
THAT BY THEN.

52
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,386
MY SENSE WAS IT'S A NET PLUS

53
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:38,054
BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP

54
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:39,955
BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS AND WHAT

55
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:42,458
HAS BEEN SAID, BUT YOU JUST

56
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,527
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

57
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:44,960
HAPPEN.

58
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,863
>> Chris: I WANT TO PICK UP,

59
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:50,299
MARA, ON BYRON'S FIRST POINT

60
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,069
BECAUSE KIM IN THE JOINT

61
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,270
STATEMENT COMMITTED TO COMPLETE

62
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,970
DENUCLEARIZATION.

63
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,905
THAT'S THE QUOTE.

64
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:57,740
BUT HE DID THE SAME IN HIS FIRST

65
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,409
MEETING WITH SOUTH KOREAN

66
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,078
PRESIDENT MOON BACK IN APRIL.

67
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:03,479
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING MORE HERE?

68
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,282
DO YOU SEE ANY MORE DETAILS, ANY

69
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:08,084
MORE MEAT ON THE BONES?

70
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:10,286
>> NOT YET, BUT THAT'S WHY

71
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,120
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO IS NOW

72
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,921
GOING TO PICK UP THE BALL AND

73
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:14,690
SEE IF THEY CAN DO THAT, FLUSH

74
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,725
IT OUT.

75
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:16,459
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS ONE THING

76
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,060
TO THE U.S. AND IT MEANS

77
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,661
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO

78
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,061
NORTH KOREA.

79
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:21,330
I THINK THEY SEE IT MORE AS A

80
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,131
FREEZE.

81
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,100
BUT THE ONE THING YOU CAN SAY IS

82
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,102
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER WHERE WE

83
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,703
ARE NOW THAN WHEN THEY WERE

84
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:28,971
THREATENING TO BLOW EACH OTHER

85
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:30,272
UP AND AS LONG AS THEY ARE

86
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,907
TALKING, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

87
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:33,943
WAR, AND EVEN IF THIS ENDS UP

88
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:36,512
WITH ONLY A FREEZE AND NOT

89
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:37,480
COMPLETE, OTHER

90
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,147
DENUCLEARIZATION, THAT STILL

91
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:40,282
BETTER THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW.

92
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:41,283
I THINK THE ONLY DANGER FOR THE

93
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:42,985
PRESIDENT IS THAT IT'S GOING TO

94
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:44,687
BE HARD TO KEEP UP THE SANCTIONS

95
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:45,321
REGIME BECAUSE THAT REALLY

96
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,657
DEPENDS ON CHINA AND AS LONG AS

97
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:49,525
KIM JONG UN IS TALKING TO THE

98
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,361
U.S., IT SEEMS LIKE CHINA IS

99
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,663
ALREADY BEGINNING TO BACK AWAY

100
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:55,297
FROM ENFORCING SANCTIONS.

101
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:58,467
>> Chris: LET'S PICK UP ON

102
00:02:58,467 --> 00:02:59,502
THAT POINT, MOLLY, BECAUSE THE

103
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:00,803
PRESIDENT SAYS HE'S GOING TO

104
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:02,505
KEEP THE SANCTIONS UP, HE'S NOT

105
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:04,406
GOING TO CALL IT MAXIMUM

106
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:05,207
PRESSURE ANYMORE, BUT HE

107
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:06,008
THINKS -- HE SAYS THAT'S WHAT

108
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,277
IT'S GOING TO BE, BUT HE ALSO

109
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:11,480
COMPLAINED THAT CHINA IS EASING

110
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,515
UP ON PATROLLING AND ENFORCING

111
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:14,250
ITS BORDER.

112
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,820
SOUTH KOREA IS EAGER TO BEGIN

113
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,721
TRADE WITH NORTH KOREA AND I

114
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:21,924
GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS

115
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:23,159
WITH CHAIRMAN KEMP NOW AT THE

116
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,327
END OF THIS SUMMIT A MUCH MORE

117
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:28,664
RESPECTFUL, NORMALIZED FIGURE IN

118
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:29,632
THE WORLD DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS,

119
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,501
IS IT GOING TO BE HARDER TO KEEP

120
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,103
UP THE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS?

121
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:34,970
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

122
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,505
THAT THE SUCCESS WE'VE HAD THUS

123
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,407
FAR HAS BEEN DUE IN LARGE PART

124
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:41,210
TO THIS VERY STRICT SANCTIONS

125
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,279
REGIME, AND SO TO ABANDON THAT

126
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,713
OR TO EASE UP ON THAT WITHOUT

127
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:48,384
SOMETHING SOLID IN RETURN MIGHT

128
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:49,285
NOT PRODUCE RESULTS THAT WE

129
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:50,286
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

130
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:53,255
AND WHAT I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP

131
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,057
AND MIKE POMPEO HAVE BEEN

132
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:56,659
TALKING ABOUT IS THE IMPORTANCE

133
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,359
OF NORTH KOREA CHOOSING A NEW

134
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,095
WAY OF BEING VERY SEEING THAT

135
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:01,130
IT'S IN THEIR INTEREST TO HAVE A

136
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,498
DIFFERENT COURSE OF ACTION THAN

137
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:04,133
THE ONE THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN.

138
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,100
SANCTIONS ARE KEY TO HELPING

139
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,869
THEM SEE THAT IT IS IN THEIR

140
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:09,271
BEST INTEREST TO HAVE A NEW

141
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,073
APPROACH, A LESS BELLICOSE

142
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,474
APPROACH, ONE WHERE THERE IS

143
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:13,976
MORE FREEDOM IN TERMS OF FREE

144
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:15,077
ENTERPRISE AND INDIVIDUAL

145
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:16,312
LIBERTY FOR THEIR PEOPLE, AND SO

146
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:17,713
I WOULD HOPE THAT EVERYONE WOULD

147
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:18,414
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE IN

148
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:20,482
KEEPING THIS TOGETHER.

149
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:22,685
WE MIGHT NEED TO RAMP UP OUR

150
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:23,886
PRESSURE ON CHINA AND OTHER

151
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:24,587
COUNTRIES TO ENSURE THAT THAT

152
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,056
DOES TAKE PLACE.

153
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:28,858
>> Chris: MOLLIE, YOUR GENERAL

154
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:30,092
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SUMMIT?

155
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,695
THERE ARE SOME CRITICS WHO ARE

156
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:34,730
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT GAVE

157
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,665
TOO MUCH CONSIDERING WHAT HE

158
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:36,932
GOT.

159
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,868
DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR?

160
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:39,702
>> IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

161
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:41,537
WITH THAT SO MANY PUNDITS BE SO

162
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:42,371
WRONG FOR SO LONG.

163
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,706
A YEAR AGO WE WERE TOLD THAT WE

164
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,708
WERE ON THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR

165
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,909
BECAUSE OF THE APPROACH THAT

166
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,710
PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE TAKEN, THAT

167
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,078
WE WOULD NEVER GET TO A SUMMIT,

168
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:50,713
THAT HE WOULD NEVER WALK AWAY TO

169
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:52,581
A SUMMIT, THAT WE COULDN'T HIT A

170
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:53,916
JUNE 12TH MEETING.

171
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,517
TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE FOREIGN

172
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,086
POLICY EXPERTS HAVE BEEN WRONG

173
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,288
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH

174
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,257
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VERY DIFFERENT

175
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:01,957
APPROACH FROM THE BIPARTISAN

176
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:03,325
CONSENSUS THAT WE HAVE SEEN

177
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:04,059
LEADING UP TO THIS.

178
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:05,261
IN FACT, WE HAVE NOT LIKE

179
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,729
PREVIOUS MEETINGS THAT WE HAD,

180
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:07,696
WE ACTUALLY HAD TO GIVE CASH

181
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:09,531
MONEY TO GET THEM TO THE TABLE.

182
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:10,900
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT THIS

183
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,300
TIME.

184
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,701
WE HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE.

185
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,903
THEY ALSO ARE A NUCLEAR POWER,

186
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:15,671
WHICH IT PUTS THEM IN A

187
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,006
DIFFERENT POSITION THAN THEY

188
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,307
HAVE BEEN IN PREVIOUS SCENARIOS.

189
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:21,110
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD FIRST STEP

190
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,844
IS BYRON AND MARA POINTED OUT,

191
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,246
THE WORD COMMIT IS IN

192
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:25,915
DISAGREEMENT I THINK EIGHT

193
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:26,315
TIMES.

194
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:28,484
THE DEVIL WILL BE IN THE

195
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,285
DETAILS.

196
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,086
THIS IS A FIRST STEP, A

197
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:31,553
PROMISING STEP.

198
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:36,025
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO SEE

199
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,927
THAT THIS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHES

200
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:38,794
THE PEACE WE ALL HOPE FOR.

201
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:40,529
>> Chris: I WANT TO GO BACK TO

202
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,398
THE ISSUE OF DENUCLEARIZATION,

203
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:43,732
BECAUSE THE WAY IT IS STATED IN

204
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:50,472
THE JOINT AGREEMENT IS THE

205
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:50,506
COMPLETE NUCLEAR IS            N

206
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:50,539
COMPLETE NUCLEAR IS            C

207
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:50,572
COMPLETE NUCLEAR IS            E

208
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:50,606
COMPLETE NUCLEAR IS            R

209
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:50,639
COMPLETE NUCLEAR IS            Z

COMPLETE NUCLEAR IS            T

214

COMPLETE NUCLEAR IS            R

215
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,942
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

216
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:53,876
FOR THE U.S. THAT MEANS THE

217
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:54,777
NORTH KOREANS GET RID OF THEIR

218
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:55,344
NUKES.

219
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:56,912
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS IT MEANS

220
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:58,113
THAT ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE

221
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,982
GONE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE NUKES

222
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:02,685
IN SOUTH KOREA, BUT WE DO HAVE

223
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:03,519
BOMBERS WITH NUKES.

224
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,454
WE DO HAVE SHIPS WITH NUKES.

225
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:07,456
WE DO HAVE SUBMARINES WITH NUKES

226
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:08,057
WE DO HAVE SUBMARINES WITH NUKE

227
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:08,357
NUKES.

228
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:09,925
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS CALLS

229
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:10,392
FOR THE COMPLETE

230
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:12,728
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

231
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,129
PENINSULA AND THE PRESIDENT

232
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:16,231
AGREED TO END THE JOINT MILITARY

233
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:17,800
EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA, AND

234
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,169
A CONCERN ON YOUR PART THAT

235
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,272
THERE IS A DANGER TO U.S. WILL

236
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:25,007
FOLD ITS NUCLEAR UMBRELLA, WHICH

237
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,608
IS A NUCLEAR GUARANTEE TO

238
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:28,310
PROTECT SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN?

239
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,911
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S

240
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:30,713
CONTEMPLATED AND I THINK THE

241
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,447
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY

242
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:35,250
DID ADDRESS THAT, THAT THAT IS

243
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,554
NOT IN THE DEFINITION OF

244
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:39,054
DENUCLEARIZATION.

245
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:41,957
ONE ADDITIONAL THING, TALKING

246
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,292
ABOUT THE SANCTIONS AND WHETHER

247
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,693
THEY HAD -- WHAT EFFECT THEY HAD

248
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:47,296
ON THIS, YES, I THINK TOUGH

249
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,530
SANCTIONS ON TOP OF PREVIOUS

250
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,065
SANCTIONS DID HAVE A BIG EFFECT

251
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:53,102
BUT ALSO THE THREAT OF WAR HAD A

252
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:53,502
BIG EFFECT.

253
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:54,403
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ANALYSTS

254
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:56,605
WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE YEAR

255
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:59,641
SAYING THAT WAR IS NOT AN OPTION

256
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,809
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA OR WAR

257
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,511
IS UNTHINKABLE IN THE KOREAN

258
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:02,878
PENINSULA.

259
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,113
THE CURRENT MILITARY TEAM WAS

260
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:06,015
THINKING ABOUT IT.

261
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,884
THEY WERE WORKING THROUGH

262
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,286
SCENARIOS AND I THINK THAT

263
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:11,987
NORTH KOREA'S KNOWLEDGE THAT

264
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:14,690
THIS SEEMINGLY UNPREDICTABLE MAN

265
00:07:14,690 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO HAD BECOME THE PRESIDENT WAS
