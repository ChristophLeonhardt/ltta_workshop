THE ROOM RIGHT THERE. 

11
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,023
THOUGH THIS WILL BE THE FIRST 

12
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,758
DAY OF MARK ZUCKERBERG'S

00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:26,726
OFFICIAL TESTIMONY ON CAPITOL

HILL, HE HAS SPOKEN TO SEVERAL

00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:30,263
LAWMAKERS PRIVATELY. 

16
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,531
HE SPENT YESTERDAY ON SOMETHING 

17
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:35,635
OF AN APOLOGY TOUR FOR ALLOWING 

18
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,836
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA TO HARVEST 

19
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,472
THE DATA OF UP TO 87 MILLION 

20
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:43,510
FACEBOOK USERS AND HE REASSURED 

21
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,312
THOSE IN A POSITION TO PROPOSE 

22
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,114
REGULATING THE TECH SECTOR THAT 

23
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,616
THE COMPANY WILL DO BETTER IF 

24
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,217
ALLOWED TO POLICE ITSELF. 

25
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:57,957
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR PANEL. 

26
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,627
DAN PATTERSON, JENNIFER

GREIDEL, AND, ROGER CHANG. 

28
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,101
DAN, LET'S START WITH YOU. 

29
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,136
CLEARLY,  MR. ZUCKERBERG NEEDS 

30
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,471
TO CONVINCE CONGRESS THAT HE IS 

31
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,909
THE MAN TO MAKE THESE CHANGES 

32
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,909
AT FACEBOOK. 

33
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,745
BUT, LET'S DISCUSS WHETHER HE 

34
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,647
REALLY IS THE PERSON TO LEAD 

35
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,847
FACEBOOK INTO THE FUTURE. 

36
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,816
DAN, LET'S START WITH YOU. 

37
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:26,119
>> WELL, IS CERTAINLY THE MOST 

38
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,288
POWERFUL PERSON IN FACEBOOK. 

39
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:30,823
THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER AND. 

40
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:33,126
THIS MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY 

41
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:37,630
FOR HIM TO REALLY STEP UP HIS 

42
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,132
LEADERSHIP AND SHOW NOT JUST 

43
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,466
CONTRITIONS BUT NEXT STEPS. 

44
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,735
HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO 

45
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,637
ABOUT IT AN INSTEAD OF DOING 

46
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:47,207
THIS OH GOLLY SHUCKS THING, TO 

47
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,307
SAY IT IS SERIOUS. 

48
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:50,610
AND THE WAY WE OPERATE IT IS 

49
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:50,877
SERIOUS. 

50
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,045
WE WILL TAKE SERIOUS STEPS TO 

51
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,548
PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING 

52
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:55,781
AGAIN. 

53
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,951
>> JENNIFER, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

54
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,321
IS IT BETTER TO SPLIT UP 

55
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,356
FACEBOOK AND HAVE MULTIPLE 

56
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:03,756
LEADERS? 

57
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,226
>> TO HAVE HIM BE CEO AND HOLD 

58
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,728
THE MAJORITY OF SHARES IS IS A 

59
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,027
HUGE RISK. 

60
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:14,133
HE HAD SAID THE DATA OF 2 

61
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,735
BILLION USERS HAD BEEN 

62
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,068
COMPROMISED. 

63
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,637
WHEN YOU HIT THAT LEVEL OF 

64
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,305
CRISIS AND ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE 

65
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,243
TO START THINKING ABOUT RADICAL 

66
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:23,543
SOLUTIONS. 

67
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,545
AND MAYBE, WE NEED HIS 

68
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,413
AUTHORITY TO BE SPLIT UP AT 

69
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:27,780
THAT POINT. 

70
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,914
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? 

71
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:30,750
>> I THINK THAT IS A LOVELY 

72
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,251
THOUGHT. 

73
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,852
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF 

74
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,053
REALISTICALLY THAT WILL HAPPEN 

75
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,955
GIVEN THE CONTROL HE HAS OVER 

76
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:36,222
FACEBOOK. 

77
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,823
AND HE IS THE FACE OF FACEBOOK. 

78
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:41,361
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A 

79
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,630
ZUCKERBERG FACEBOOK WITHOUT 

80
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,163
ZUCKERBERG IN CHARGE. 

81
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,698
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS A 

82
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,298
PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO. 

83
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:48,167
>> HE CARES ABOUT HOW PEOPLE 

84
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:48,534
SEE HIM. 

85
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,669
HE CARES ABOUT HIS IMAGE. 

86
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,104
HE WENT ON THE NATIONAL TOUR TO 

87
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,739
TALK TO REGULAR FOLKS AROUND 

88
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,074
THE COUNTRY ALMOST AS IF IT WAS 

89
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,442
A PREPRESIDENTIAL, YOU KNOW, AS 

90
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,344
IF HE WERE WEIGHING THOUGHTS OF 

91
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,247
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SOME DAY. 

92
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:07,520
CLEARLY, HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS 

93
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,089
THIS IDEALISTIC ENTREPRENEUR. 

94
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,958
HE SAID FACEBOOK IS IDEALISTIC. 

95
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,760
IT IS THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY. 

96
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,065
DOES THAT MESSAGE RESONATE 

97
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:19,332
ANYMORE? 

98
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,368
>> Reporter: WHAT IT DOES DO IS 

99
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,336
SYMBOLIZE FACEBOOK'S RESPONSE 

100
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:31,610
TO THESE TYPES OF CRISIS. 

101
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,179
WHILE THEY MAKE CHANGES, THEY 

102
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,648
PUT OUT CRISIS COMS AND PUT A 

103
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,151
BIG PRETTY FACE AS THEIR NUMBER 

104
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:38,484
ONE PRIORITY. 

105
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,255
SO, HE CAN GO ON A TOUR IF HE 

106
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,257
WANTS AND THEY CAN CERTAINLY 

107
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,759
PUT BIG PRETTY BUTTONS UP TO 

108
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,162
SAY WE WILL MANAGE YOUR 

109
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,464
SECURITY, BUT IT FEELS LIKE 

110
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:51,664
SPIN. 

111
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:56,169
>> SO ARE PEOPLE TIRED OF THE 

112
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,203
KUM BAH BHA MESSAGE? 

113
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:00,740
>> THE WAY HE HAS POSITIONED 

114
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,642
HIMSELF IS AS A PHILANTHROPIST 

115
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,377
AND SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BRING 

116
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,279
THE WORLD TOGETHER AND BUILD 

117
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,579
COMMUNITY. 

118
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,480
IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO 

119
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,682
LOOK AT HIM AND SAY YOU HAVE 

120
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,783
EXPOSED 2 BILLION PEOPLE AND 

121
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,151
THEIR PRIVACY AND DATA AND WE 

122
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,819
NEED TO REGULATE YOU. 

123
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,255
>> AND YOU MAKE MONEY OFF OF 

124
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:16,488
IT. 

125
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,957
>> A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY, SHE 

126
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,392
ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE ON 

127
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,060
THE PLANET SO IT IS HARD TO BE 

128
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,663
UPSET AT HIM WHILE HE IS 

129
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,864
FEEDING YOU THESE NICE LINES 

130
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,300
BUT AGAIN, WE NEED TO HOLD HIM 

131
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,633
ACCOUNTABLE. 

132
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,901
WE NEED OUR REGULATORS TO TAKE 

133
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,737
A HARD LOOK AT THIS COMPANY AN 

134
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,105
HOW THEY ARE IMPACTING US. 

135
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:33,472
>> RIGHT. 

136
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:37,276
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT 

137
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,879
A FAKE BLACK LIVES MATTER PAGE 

138
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,147
WAS EXPOSED VERY RECENTLY. 

139
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:43,282
APPARENTLY, ORGANIZERS OF THE 

140
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,285
REAL BLACK LIVES MATTER PAGE 

141
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,487
HAD ALERTED FACEBOOK TO THIS 

142
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,488
PAGE A WHILE AGO. 

143
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,524
WHAT WAS THE STORY THERE ROGER? 

144
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,192
>> IT TURNS OUT IT WAS SOMEONE 

145
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,294
WHO WORKED FOR THE UNION LABOR 

146
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:55,795
IN AUSTRALIA. 

147
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:02,702
A WHITE MAN WHO SET THIS UP, 

148
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,070
SOLICITED DONATIONS AND KEPT 

149
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,270
THEM. 

150
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,938
DID IT JUST TO MAKE A BUCK. 

151
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,774
THIS ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM 

152
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,574
THE PLATFORM HAS. 

153
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,110
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT FAKE NEWS 

154
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,279
OR THE WRONG KINDS OF ADS. 

155
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,983
THERE'S A BROADER PROBLEM WITH 

156
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,250
FACEBOOK. 

157
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,952
FACEBOOK DOESN'T QUITE HAVE A 

158
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,488
HANDLE ON IT YET. 

159
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,190
>> IT GREW TOO FAST AND TOO 

160
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,423
QUICK. 

161
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,793
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE UNDERLYING 

162
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,660
INFRASTRUCTURE OR ENOUGH PEOPLE 

163
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,395
THERE TO GOVERN IT IN A SAFE 

164
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:29,595
WAY. 

165
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,829
>> JENNIFER, YOU MENTIONED 

166
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:31,998
TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT SOMEDAY 

167
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:37,336
FOR THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. 

168
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,071
AS AN ENTITY. 

169
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,338
HOW SO? 

170
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,708
>> THIS IS A MONUMENTAL DAY TO 

171
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,709
HAVE MARK ZUCKERBERG SITTING 

172
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,211
BEFORE THE JOINT COMMITTEE AND 

173
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,512
SHOWING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE 

174
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:46,812
FIRST TIME. 

175
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,848
I HOPE OUR REGULATORS ASK HARD 

176
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,916
QUESTIONS TODAY AND GET SOME 

177
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,550
FACTS ON THE TABLE. 

178
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,821
THEN BUILD A STRUCTURE TO 

179
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,855
REGULATE THESE COMPANIES. 

180
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,957
I HOPE THEY SHOW THEY HAVE THE 

181
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,659
APPETITE TO DIG IN AND SHOW 

182
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,059
SOME REGULATION. 

183
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,362
>> AND WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? 

184
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,964
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 

185
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,232
RELATIONSHIP TO ADVERTISING 

186
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:06,666
COMPANIES. 

187
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,834
IS THAT A FUNDAMENTAL 

188
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,168
RELATIONSHIP THAT NEED TO 

189
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:09,401
SHIFT? 

190
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:13,539
>> WELL, WE CAN LOOK TO 

191
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,040
PRECEDENT. 

192
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,507
HISTORICAL PRECEDENT. 

193
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,274
WE SAW MICROSOFT BEHAVE IN A 

194
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,976
SIMILAR WAY IN THE LATE 80s  

195
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:22,882
AND THE LATE 90s . BILL GATES 

196
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,018
WAS A ZUCKERBERG TYPE FIGURE. 

197
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,954
WHEN MICROSOFT WAS BROKEN UP, 

198
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,989
WE SAW IT PUT UNDER DIFFERENT 

199
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:30,422
LEADERSHIP TENTS. 

200
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,991
THAT IS SOMETHING WE MIGHT SEE 

201
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,759
HAPPEN WITH FACEBOOK. 

202
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,199
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR 

203
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,667
ADVERTISERS WE SEE THEM SAYING 

204
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,868
THE ADVERTISERS WILL COME BACK. 

205
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:44,437
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 

206
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,072
CULTURE CLASH WE ARE ABOUT TO 

207
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,840
SEE BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY AND 

208
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,775
CAPITOL HILL? 

209
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,011
>> WE SAW THIS IN NOVEMBER WITH 

210
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,713
GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AND TWITTER. 

211
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:59,719
WE WILL SEE IT AGAIN WITH 

212
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,286
ZUCKERBERG. 

213
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,989
CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT HIGH ON 

214
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,391
SILICON VALLEY'S PRIORITY LIST. 

215
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,228
DC IS USED TO MORE STABLE 

216
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:09,761
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES. 

217
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,396
I THINK WE WILL SEE A LOT OF 

218
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:12,431
BUTTING HEADS. 

219
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:12,798
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

220
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:16,035
AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE 

221
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:20,106
TOPIC OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE 

222
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,942
TROLLS AND THESE RUSSIAN TROLL 

223
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,442
FARMS. 

224
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:26,245
WHAT IS ZUCKERBERG EXPECTED TO 

225
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,179
SAY ABOUT THOSE? 

226
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,047
THAT HE NEEDS HELP? 

227
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,915
>> THEY ARE TRYING TO RESPOND. 

228
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,350
AND, I THINK WHEN IT COMES DOWN 

229
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,353
TO ANY OF THESE FAKE NEWS 

230
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,156
PAGES, ANY OF THESE FAKE BLACK 

231
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,558
LIVES MATTER PAGES, THE REAL 

232
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:43,496
WORD WE NEED TO BE TALKING 

233
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,999
ABOUT IS EXPLOITATION. 

234
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,568
FACEBOOK UNLIKE OTHER SOCIAL 

235
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,536
MEDIA PLATFORMS IS RIPE FOR 

236
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:50,870
EXPLOITATION. 

237
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,404
THEY CAN'T SOLVE A TROLL 

238
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,639
PROBLEM OR THESE OTHER 

239
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,373
PROPAGANDA PROBLEMS WITHOUT 

240
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,475
TAKING A LOOK AT THE 

241
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,277
FUNDAMENTAL MECHANICS OF HOW 

242
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,045
THEIR SOCIAL NETWORK OPERATES. 

243
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:06,485
THAT MIGHT BE AN EXISTENTIAL 

244
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:06,718
THREAT. 

245
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,621
>> HE DID NOT WRITE THIS 

246
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:08,988
HIMSELF. 

247
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,090
BECAUSE HE IS BUSY ON HIS PAGE, 

248
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,525
BUT IT SAID IN AN HOUR I WILL 

249
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,892
TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THE SENATE 

250
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,896
ABOUT HOW FACEBOOK NEEDS TO 

251
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,631
TAKE A BROADER VIEW AS OUR 

252
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,701
RESPONSIBILITY TO USE THE TOOLS 

253
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:21,968
FOR GOOD. 

254
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,636
I WILL MAKE FACEBOOK A PLACE 

255
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,503
WHERE PEOPLE CAN STAY CLOSER 

256
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,671
WITH THE PEOPLE THEY CARE ABOUT 

257
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,938
AND MAKE SURE IT IS A POSITIVE 

258
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,106
FORCE IN THE WORLD. 

259
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,208
HE MAY HAVE WRITTEN IT. 

260
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,578
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HIS PR TEAM. 

261
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,647
WHO KNOWS. 

262
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,616
BUT THAT'S THE MESSAGE HE KEEPS 

263
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:38,017
REPEATING. 

264
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,318
HE IS A FORCE FOR POSITIVE 

265
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,251
CHANGE IN THE WORLD. 

266
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,921
>> THERE'S A LOT OF FEEL GOOD 

267
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,955
COMMENTS IN THERE. 

268
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,025
BUT, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF 

269
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:46,792
CONCRETE POINTS OR EVIDENCE 

270
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,827
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING 

271
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,694
ANYTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEMS. 

272
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:51,530
>> AND WHY IT TOOK SO LONG. 

273
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,232
I THINK THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF 

274
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,066
PEOPLE ARE ANGRY ABOUT. 

275
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,768
IT IS ONE THING TO SAY OOPS, 

276
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,036
THIS HAPPENED BUT IT IS ANOTHER 

277
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,904
THING TO SAY OOPS, THIS 

278
00:08:58,904 --> 00:08:59,805
HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO. 

279
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,507
AND WE STILL DIDN'T GET A 

280
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,309
HANDLE ON IT. 

281
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,645
>> AND, THAT THERE IS NOT AN 

282
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:07,747
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ALL OF THE 

283
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,014
BAD THINGS WE HAVE HERE AND 

284
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,850
THAT OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED IN 

285
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,183
THEIR LIVES. 

286
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,051
I THINK THAT THE REAL THING 

287
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,254
THAT IS MISSING HERE IS 

288
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:15,521
EMPATHY. 

289
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,756
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO FEEL THAT 

290
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:21,360
ACTUAL HARM HAS BEEN DONE TO 

291
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,561
HUMANS AND SAYING HEY LOOK AT 

292
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,863
THE GOOD THINGS HERE IN THIS 

293
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,264
HAND, FORGET ABOUT THE BAD 

294
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:25,764
THINGS HAPPENING HERE. 

295
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:28,968
>> AND ONE WONDER WHAT HE 

296
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,269
ACTUALLY FEELS BECAUSE IN 2011 

297
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,438
I BELIEVE IT WAS, HE WAS QUOTED 

298
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,140
AS SAYING PRIVACY IS DEAD. 

299
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,676
SO, ONE HAS TO WONDER DOES HE 

300
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,977
ACTUALLY FEEL THAT WAY? 

301
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,679
YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES HE THINK 

302
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,016
ABOUT OUR LIVES ONLINE? 

303
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,785
>> I THINK HE HAS BEEN WORKING 

304
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,352
TO ENSURE HIS OWN PRIVACY. 

305
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:48,888
WE HEAR ABOUT HOW HE BUYS THE 

306
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,689
HOMES NEXT TO HIS HOME. 

307
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:51,924
BLOCKS OUT OTHER PEOPLE. 

308
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,259
BUT, HE IS IN CONTROL. 

309
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,360
AND, HE STILL HAS HIS PRIVACY. 

310
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,498
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE 

311
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,801
TWO BILLION PLUS USERS AROUND 

312
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,135
THE WORLD. 

313
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,637
ESPECIALLY HERE IN AMERICA. 

314
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,772
THE FACTS ARE FACEBOOK HAS DONE 

315
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,374
A LOT OF HARM. 

316
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,210
AND A COUPLE OF SCENARIOS I'M 

317
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,712
SURE THEY HAVE DONE SOME GOOD, 

318
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,013
BUT THERE HAS BEEN REAL HARM 

319
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,215
FROM THE WAY HE HAS RUN HIS 

320
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:16,482
COMPANY. 

321
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,549
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW THAT UP 

322
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:22,187
WITH COMMENTS HE IS  EXPECTED 

323
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:25,858
TO SAME HE SAYS FACEBOOK HAS 

324
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,759
HELPED POSITIVE MOVEMENTS LIKE 

325
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,159
ME TOO. 

326
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,762
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? 

327
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,564
>> I MENTIONED ME TOO AND LIVES 

328
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,501
FOR OUR LIVES ARE TWITTER USE 

329
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:35,734
CASES. 

330
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,670
IN PART, THEY WERE COORDINATED 

331
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,503
ON HIS PLATFORM. 

332
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:39,672
HE IS TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR 

333
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,175
SOME OF THE STUFF HAPPENING ON 

334
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,877
TWITTER WHICH DOES DRIVE A LOT 

335
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,479
OF SOCIAL CHANGES BUT HE IS 

336
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,080
REALLY SCRAPING TO FIND 

337
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,647
POSITIVE USE CASES. 

338
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,015
>> RIGHT, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT 

339
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:54,987
PACT OF -- PART OF HIS MESSAGE 

340
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,287
RESONATES. 

341
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,589
IF YOU ARE SUFFERING, IF YOU 

342
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,924
ARE A VICTIM IN THE ME TOO 

343
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,626
MOVEMENT, IT HELPS TO HAVE 

344
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,561
OTHERS SAY ME TOO. 

345
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,029
IT FORMS A SOLIDARITY. 

346
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,798
>> BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO MENTION 

347
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:15,540
SOME OF THE CRISIS IN MYANMAR. 

348
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,909
THE ETHNI CLEANSING THERE IS 

349
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,111
TAKING PLACE, WE KNOW ABOUT IT 

350
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,846
BECAUSE OF FACEBOOK AND THEIR 

351
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,579
FREE BASIS PROGRAM. 

352
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,915
THAT IS A CRISIS OVER THERE AND 

353
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,382
HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO 

354
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:24,816
ADDRESS IT. 

355
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,852
>> YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT 

356
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,521
JENNIFER, DAN, WHAT DO YOU 

357
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,222
THINK ABOUT THIS, THE WAY 

358
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,425
FACEBOOK HAS TO CHANGE 

359
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,426
PRIVACYSETTINGS DEFENDING ON 

360
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:35,293
THE COUNTRY. 

361
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,163
EUROPE IS ASKING FOR STRICTER 

362
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,631
PRIVACY SETTINGS AND THE U.S. 

363
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,066
WILL PROBABLY START TO ASK THAT 

364
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,167
AS WELL. 

365
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,604
HOW CAN FACEBOOK NAVIGATE THAT? 

366
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,539
>> FACEBOOK'S ARGUMENT IS THAT 

367
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,375
WE HAVE 2 BILLION USERS, THAT'S 

368
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,942
A LOT OF SCALE. 

369
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,777
TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS AT 

370
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,178
SCALE TO WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE 

371
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:55,380
RESPONDED THERE IS NO RIGHT TO 

372
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:55,614
SCALE. 

373
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,683
YOU DO NOT HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL 

374
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,084
RIGHT TO OPERATE AT LARGE SCALE 

375
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:03,121
AND IF YOU CANNOT OPERATE AT 

376
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,390
LARGE SCALE SAFELY, THEN 

377
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,691
PERHAPS YOU NEED TO BE REINED 

378
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:05,991
IN. 

379
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,260
WE WOULD SAY THE SAME THING TO 

380
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,962
AN AIRLINE COMPANY OR CAR 

381
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,295
MANUFACTURER. 

382
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,097
IF YOU CANNOT MAKE THE CAR OR 

383
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,899
AIRLINE SAFE, YOU HAVE TO FIX 

384
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,065
IT. 

385
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,901
>> WHY DO THEY HAVE A 

386
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,002
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE US 

387
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,771
OPT OUT OF SHARING OUR 

388
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,272
INFORMATION RATHER THAN OPTING 

389
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:20,438
IN? 

390
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:23,509
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? 

391
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,044
>> THAT IS INTERESTING. 

392
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,848
VERIZON SAND AT&T, THEY ARE SAL 

393
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,148
GAITING OVER THIS AD MARKET. 

394
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:32,318
BUT THEY ARE BOUND BY THE FCC 

395
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:38,524
WHERE THERE IS AN OPT IN 

396
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,057
MANDATORY REQUIREMENT. 

397
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:40,926
WITH THE TECH COMPANIES, THEY 

398
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,860
SHOULD LOOK INTO WHETHER OPT IN 

399
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,329
SHOULD BE THE STANDARD FOR TECH 

400
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,596
COMPANIES WHEN IT COMES TO 

401
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:45,064
PERSONAL DATA. 

402
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,866
>> THIS IS BIG IN EUROPE AS 

403
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,066
WELL. 

404
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:52,103
ESPECIALLY IN THE MARKETING 

405
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:52,337
SPACE. 

406
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:55,740
THE USER INTERFACE ON FACEBOOK 

407
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,042
WAS DESIGNED TO GET YOU TO 

408
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,678
CLICK ON THINGS AND DIVULGE 

409
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,079
MORE PERSON INFORMATION. 

410
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:01,980
IT WAS BY DESIGN. 

411
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,550
THIS WAS NOT A MISTAKE. 

412
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,718
>> JEN BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT. 

413
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,320
THERE WAS A SHIFT IN FACEBOOK A 

414
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,322
FEW YEARS AGO WHEN YOU COMPOSE 

415
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:14,894
AN E-MAIL OR EVEN A NOTE, YOU 

416
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,260
HIT SEND. 

417
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,196
EXPLICITLY YOU HAVE TO HIT 

418
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:17,696
SEND. 

419
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,363
FACEBOOK CHANGED THE COMMENTING 

420
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:21,166
SYSTEM AND THE NOTIFICATION 

421
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,501
SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME SO 

422
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,002
IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU TYPE YOUR 

423
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:24,369
SHORT COMMENT. 

424
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:26,071
THIS IS AFTER THEY TRIED TO BUY 

425
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:26,338
TWITTER. 

426
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,740
YOU HIT ENTER AND IT WOULD 

427
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,576
LEAVE A SHORTER FASTER COMMENT. 

428
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:36,649
YOU TIE THAT IN WITH A READ 

429
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,349
NOTIFICATION. 

430
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,717
YOU GET THE DOPAMINE PANG AND 

431
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,519
THEN THERMORE NOTIFICATIONS 

432
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:40,919
IN THE NETWORK. 

433
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,622
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT THIS 

434
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:48,627
SHARING OF INFORMATION IS SO 

435
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,928
DEEPLY ENGAINED IN THE ALGA 

436
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:57,436
RHYTHM OF HOW FACEBOOK WORKS IT 

437
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,371
WOULD MEAN DISMANTLING IT AND 

438
00:13:59,371 --> 00:13:59,771
RETOOLING IT? 

439
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,707
>> THE COMPANY IS DESIGNING THE 

440
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,942
INTERFACE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. 

441
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,545
WE HAVE SEEN HOW YOU DISCONNECT 

442
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,948
YOUR APIs . THEY MADE THAT 

443
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,181
EASIER. 

444
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,149
THEY ARE MOVING PRIVACY 

445
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,650
SETTINGS TO THE NEWS FEED. 

446
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,751
THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY 

447
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,086
BEEN IN PLACE. 

448
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,955
>> LET'S SAY THEY DO IMPLEMENT 

449
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,457
SOME SORT OF OPT IN TO SHARE 

450
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,358
INFORMATION RATHER THAN OPT 

451
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,159
OUT. 

452
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,793
WHO IS GOING TO OPT IN? 

453
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:22,060
NO ONE. 

454
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,963
>> THAT WOULD BE A SEVERE 

455
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:28,567
DETRIMENT TO ITS CORE BUSINESS 

456
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:28,800
MODEL. 

457
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,669
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE REALLY 

458
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,437
RELUCTANT TO DO THIS. 

459
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,838
>> THERE ARE PLENTY OF 

460
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:33,872
PROTESTERS THERE ON CAPITOL 

461
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,073
HILL HOLDING UP SIGNS. 

462
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:36,875
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 

463
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:41,380
IF THERE IS ANY REACTION FROM 

464
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,983
THOSE LISTENS TO THE TESTIMONY 

465
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:44,883
OF MARK ZUCKERBERG. 

466
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,951
HE MUST BE NERVOUS. 

467
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:47,452
HE LOOKED NERVOUS. 

468
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,588
WE SAW HIM COMING IN TO SPEAK 

469
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,789
WITH SENATORS YESTERDAY. 

470
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,357
HE HAD HIS GAME FACE ON, BUT 

471
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:52,957
LOOKED NERVOUS. 

472
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,827
>> HE IS NOT KNOWN FOR BEING 

473
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,595
THE MOST POLISHED SPEAKER IN 

474
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,796
CONTROLLED SETTINGS SO IT WILL 

475
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,099
BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE 

476
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,970
HOLDS UP TO HOURS OF TESTIMONY. 

477
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,705
SENATORS LOOKING TO GRAND STAND 

478
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:07,873
AND ASK SHARP QUESTIONS. 

479
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,641
>> HE HAD TO COME IN PERSON. 

480
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,276
WE KNEW THIS HAS BEEN LOOMING. 

481
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,211
WAS THERE ANY QUESTION WHETHER 

482
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,378
HE WOULD SHOW UP? 

483
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,779
>> NO, HE HAS TO SHOW UP. 

484
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,916
AND HE HAS TO SHOW UP NOT JUST 

485
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,119
TO FULFILL HIS RESPONSIBILITY 

486
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,420
AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER IN 

487
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:32,931
THE COMPANY, BUT ALSO, TO 

488
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,300
SATISFY LAWMAKERS. 

489
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,635
LAWMAKERS ARE CRAFTY AND GOOD 

490
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,104
AT ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. 

491
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:39,538
THEY ARE EXPERTS. 

492
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,007
>> DOES THAT APPLY TO THE TECH 

493
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,340
WORLD TOO? 

494
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,675
THE CULTURE CLASH BETWEEN 

495
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,044
SILICON VALLEY AND CAPITOL 

496
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:45,244
HILL. 

497
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,545
WILL THEY ASK THE RIGHT 

498
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:46,845
QUESTIONS? 

499
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,448
>> I MEAN, I IMAGINE THEY HAVE 

500
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,849
GOT AIDES COMING UP WITH THE 

501
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:55,087
EXACT QUESTIONS TO GET UNDER 

502
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:55,420
MARK'S SKIN. 

503
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,955
WE SAW IT A LITTLE BIT IN 

504
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:57,222
NOVEMBER. 

505
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,525
THOSE WERE GENERAL COUNSELS, 

506
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:00,792
LAWYERS. 

507
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,461
SOME OF THEM WERE GETTING FED 

508
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,964
UP BY THE SHEER REPETITION OF 

509
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,331
THE QUESTIONS. 

510
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,265
I'M SURE ZUCKERBERG HAS GONE 

511
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,966
THROUGH A FAIR AMOUNT OF MEDIA 

512
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:08,567
TRAINING FOR THIS. 

513
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,602
BUT IT IS HARD TO TRAIN ANYONE 

514
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,437
FOR TWO TO THREE HOURS OF A 

515
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,538
CONSTANT BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS. 

516
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,674
>> THERE IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF A 

517
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,009
CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST 

518
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:17,476
FACEBOOK. 

519
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,677
IS THE COMPANY PREPARED FOR 

520
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:18,877
THIS? 

521
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,212
>> DAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

522
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,483
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY 

523
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,018
COMPANY AT THIS SCALE IS 

524
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,419
PREPARED FOR ANY TYPE OF CIVIL 

525
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,587
ACTION, BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE 

526
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,222
A LOT OF LAWYERS SO I'M SURE 

527
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,023
...  

528
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,357
AND A LOT OF MONEY. 

529
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,692
SO I'M SURE THEY WILL BE 

530
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,127
PREPARED TO RESPOND IN SOME 

531
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:35,327
WAY. 

532
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,129
>> THIS COULD BE A MASSIVE 

533
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,131
CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THAT WOULD 

534
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,698
DWARF ANYTHING PREVIOUS, NO? 

535
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,035
>> 87 MILLION IS A FAIRLY LARGE 

536
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:43,268
NUMBER. 

537
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:43,535
SO YEAH. 

538
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,606
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING IN 

539
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,242
CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ED O' 

540
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,443
KEEFE FROM WASHINGTON. 

541
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,044
WHAT ARE LAWMAKERS LOOKING TO 

542
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,646
HEAR FROM MARK ZUCKERBERG 

543
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:54,879
TODAY? 

544
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,315
>> I THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR 

545
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,150
HIM SAY WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN 

546
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,650
LEAKED OUT. 

547
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,553
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A VERY 

548
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:01,920
CLEAR APOLOGY. 

549
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,654
AND ACCEPTANCE OF 

550
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,655
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAS 

551
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,357
TRANSPIRED BUT THEY WILL ALSO 

552
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,558
WANT SOME ANSWERS ON WHAT 

553
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,358
SPECIFICALLY THE COMPANY KNEW 

554
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:13,065
OR WHAT IT DIDN'T KNOW. 

555
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,067
AND WHEN IT LEARNED ABOUT WHAT 

556
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:15,867
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WAS UP TO 

557
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,137
AND IF THERE IS MORE OF THIS TO 

558
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,339
COME OR IF HE IS WILLING TO 

559
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,540
REVEAL ANYTHING ELSE ALONG 

560
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:21,873
THOSE LINES. 

561
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:22,874
THE OTHER THING INTERESTING TO 

562
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,476
SEE IS WHETHER HE GETS DRAWN 

563
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:28,914
OUT OR CALLED OUT AT ALL. 

564
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,684
ON WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 

565
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,988
CONGRESS OR FEDERAL REGULATORS 

566
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:37,589
DO. 

567
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,391
WHAT HE SAID IN HIS OTHER 

568
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,192
MEETINGS, EXECUTIVES SAID THEY 

569
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,196
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE 

570
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,497
REGULATION FROM THE FEDERAL 

571
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:45,797
GOVERNMENT. 

572
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,599
THAT WILL BE AN INTERESTING 

573
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,900
SIDE SHOW IN ALL OF THIS. 

574
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,571
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS CERTAINLY  

575
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,573
EAGER TO DO THAT. 

576
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,308
YOU HAVE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO 

577
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,111
ARE IN FAVOR OF TAKING SOME 

578
00:17:59,111 --> 00:17:59,544
REGULATORY STEPS. 

579
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:03,916
BUT, OTHERS WHO WOULD PREFER TO 

580
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,817
SEE FACEBOOK AND OTHER SIMILAR 

581
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,419
COMPANIES SELF-REGULATE OR COME 

582
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,922
UP WITH WAYS TO MAKE CLEAR TO 

583
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,323
CUSTOMERS THEIR DATA IS 

584
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:11,623
PROTECTED. 

585
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,225
SO, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WILL 

586
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,126
HAVE A POLICY DEBATE OVER THE 

587
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,127
COURSE OF THIS. 

588
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,094
BUT WHAT THIS WILL PROBABLY 

589
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:17,529
HELP FOLKS WHO TRACK THE POLICY 

590
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,431
SIDE OF THIS AND THE POLITICS 

591
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,033
IS GET A BETTER SENSE OF AMONG 

592
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,204
THE 40 OR SO SENATORS, WHAT IS 

593
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,304
THE APPETITE FOR POTENTIAL 

594
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,806
REFORM AND WHAT IS THE 

595
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,707
TIMETABLE FOR THAT? 

596
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,244
REMEMBER, WE ARE IN AN ELECTION 

597
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:32,444
YEAR. 

598
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,046
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO 

599
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:38,050
DO ANYTHING DRAMATIC OR 

600
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,751
CONTROVERSIAL, MOST OF 

601
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,752
WASHINGTON IS WORRIED ABOUT 

602
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,953
WHAT HAPPENS IN NOVEMBER THAN 

603
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,655
ANYTHING ELSE. 

604
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,257
>> SURE, 61%, YOU KNOW, IN OUR 

605
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,459
OWN POLLS SAY THAT USERS 

606
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,760
ACTUALLY WANT INCREASED 

607
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,965
GOVERNMENT REGULATION TO SOCIAL 

608
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,865
MEDIA. 

609
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:54,332
AND TECH COMPANIES. 

610
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,068
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT 

611
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:56,868
POTENTIAL REGULATION COULD LOOK 

612
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:57,168
LIKE HERE. 

613
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,436
>> YOU ARE ASKING ME? 

614
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:58,703
>> YEAH. 

615
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,505
>> IT COULD BE A FEW THINGS. 

616
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:01,740
SOME OF THIS COULD BE DONE 

617
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,608
OBVIOUSLY THROUGH THE FEDERAL 

618
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:04,075
TRADE COMMISSION. 

619
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:09,414
OTHERWISE F IT COULD BE DONE 

620
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:09,881
THROUGH LEGISLATION. 

621
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,517
THAT IS WHAT IS NOT ENTIRELY 

622
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:12,918
CLEAR. 

623
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,419
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, SILICON 

624
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:21,193
VALLEY, THE  THE TECH WORLD 

625
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:21,626
KNOWS THIS. 

626
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:27,633
THAT WASHINGTON IS FAIRLY FAR 

627
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,034
BEHIND TECH TRENDS AND STAYING 

628
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,903
AT PACE OR AHEAD OF THESE 

629
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:32,203
CHANGES. 

630
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:34,406
SO, EVEN IF THEY WERE TO PASS 

631
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,843
SOMETHING, YOU HAVE TO WONDER 

632
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:43,048
HOW MUCH WILL IT REALLY STICK 

633
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,050
AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO 

634
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,283
EVOLVE. 

635
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:49,955
SO I THINK THE LEVEL OF 

636
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,958
SPECIFICITY WE GET WILL BE 

637
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,559
MINIMAL AND IT REMAIN TO BE 

638
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:54,759
SEEN. 

639
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,961
FRANKLY WHAT WOULD DRIVE THE 

640
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:04,736
DEBATE IS IF THERE IS SOME 

641
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,203
OTHER REVELATION. 

642
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:10,776
IS THERE SOME OTHER CAMBRIDGE 

643
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,476
ANALYTICA OUT THERE. 

644
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,645
HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER SIMILAR 

645
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:13,945
PROBLEMS? 

646
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:14,646
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL 

647
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,947
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. 

648
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,549
THERE HAS BEEN LEGISLATION 

649
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,450
PROPOSED BUT NO ACTUAL REAL 

650
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,517
MOVEMENT ON IT AND I SUSPECT 

651
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:20,818
YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE 

652
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:21,919
SENATORS TODAY TALK ABOUT IT. 

653
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,790
OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND 

654
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,494
TANYA, THIS IS A RARE SIGHT TO 

655
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,996
HAVE 43, 44 SENATORS TOGETHER 

656
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:36,168
IN A ROOM QUESTIONING ONE 

657
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:36,401
PERSON. 

658
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,969
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SEE 

659
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,137
IN THE SENATE, BUT YOU HAVE A 

660
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,539
JOINT HEARING HERE OF THE 

661
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,575
SENATE COMMERCE AND THE SENATE 

662
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,576
JUDICIARY COMMITTEES MEANING 

663
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,110
TOGETHER. 

664
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,644
THERE IS SOME OVERLAP. 

665
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,780
FOUR OR FIVE MEMBERS, FOUR OR 

666
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,781
FIVE SENATORS MEMBERS OF BOTH 

667
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,718
COMMITTEES BUT THEY WILL SORT 

668
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,887
OF GO THROUGH HERE. 

669
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,989
BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM HAVE 

670
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:58,322
JURISDICTION. 

671
00:20:58,322 --> 00:21:02,260
AND THIS HEARING ROOM THEY ARE 

672
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,499
HOLDING IT, 216 IS TAILOR MADE 

673
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:07,999
FOR THIS. 

674
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,035
THE SKY BOXES ARE BUILT FOR OUR 

675
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,770
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES WHO CAN 

676
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,971
WATCH AND COVER THESE HEARINGS 

677
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:17,775
AS IF IT IS A TV SPECTACLE 

678
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,811
WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THIS IS 

679
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,044
ABOUT. 

680
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,813
THEY WILL USE THIS AS A CHANCE 

681
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,648
TO YELL AND SCREAM AT 

682
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:24,682
ZUCKERBERG TO SOME EXPENT. 

683
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:28,653
SCORE SOME POINTS AND HOPE WE 

684
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:31,022
WILL REPLAY THE PASSAGES LATER 

685
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:31,188
ON. 

686
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,323
THEY ARE EITHER UP FOR 

687
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:34,893
REELECTION THIS YEAR OR 

688
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,029
THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. 

689
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:42,434
ANY TIME  NAGS NAGS TELEVISION 

690
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:47,406
IS TUNED IN, THEY WILL PUT ON A 

691
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,106
SHOW. 

692
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,440
>> STRENGTHENING POLITICAL AD 

693
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
POLICIES AND ESTABLISHING A 

694
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,043
RESEARCH COMMISSION, IS ALL OF 

695
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:53,545
THIS ENOUGH TO PLEASE THE 

696
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:59,851
LAWMAKERS DO YOU THINK, ED? 

697
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,084
>> NO. 

698
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:00,785
NOT NECESSARILY. 

699
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,354
CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE THOSE 

700
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,456
PLEASED BECAUSE THEY ARE A FAN 

701
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,157
OF SELF-REGULATING BUT OTHERS 

702
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,058
WILL SAY YOU HAVE TO DO MORE, 

703
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:12,164
YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE YOU 

704
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:12,830
HAVE MADE CHANGES. 

705
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,166
AND THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT 

706
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,067
THE POLITICAL AD IDENTIFICATION 

707
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:16,367
LOOKS LIKE. 

708
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:17,636
IS IT SIMILAR TO A CANDIDATE 

709
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,839
SAYING HE OR SHE APPROVED THIS 

710
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,107
MESSAGE OR IT REVEALED WHICH 

711
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:24,008
SUPERPAC PAID FOR IT? 

712
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:25,476
IS IT SAID THROUGH AUDIO? 

713
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:26,645
WHAT WILL THAT LOOK LIKE? 

714
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,480
I THINK THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW 

715
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,781
MORE ABOUT THAT AS WELL. 

716
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,248
>> THANKS ED. 

717
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,150
WE WILL TALK TO YOU A LITTLE 

718
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,784
LATER. 

719
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:41,860
WE WILL GO BACK TO OUR 

720
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,293
ILLUSTRIOUS PANEL. 

721
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:44,262
HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT GETTING 

722
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,464
RID OF THESE APPS. 

723
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,066
THESE APPS ARE NOT GOING TO 

724
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:48,967
DISAPPEAR, THE APPS THAT 

725
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:49,901
COLLECT OUR INFORMATION. 

726
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,470
HE IS TALKING ABOUT REGULATING 

727
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,604
THEM AND MAKING SURE THERE IS 

728
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,738
MORE CONTROL OVER THEM. 

729
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:56,675
BUT WHY ALLOW THE APPS AT ALL? 

730
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:56,908
ROGER? 

731
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,577
>> WELL, I THINK ONE OF THE 

732
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:04,182
KEYS TO FACEBOOK'S GROWTH WAS 

733
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:04,783
THESE APPS. 

734
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,784
FUN LITTLE QUIZZES OR GAMES YOU 

735
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,951
WERE ABLE TO SHARE AND HELP 

736
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:09,054
CREATE THAT IDEA THAT FEELING 

737
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,424
OF A COMMUNITY IN FACEBOOK. 

738
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,492
GOING BACK TO THE CORE OF 

739
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,759
BUSINESS AND THE FACT THE APPS 

740
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,163
ARE TAKING YOUR DATA, THAT IS 

741
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,964
STILL CRITICAL TO HOW FACEBOOK 

742
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:20,765
MAKES ITS MONEY. 

743
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:24,669
IT SAYS IT WANTS TO REGULATE 

744
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:24,902
ITSELF. 

745
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:25,770
>> BUT IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN. 

746
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,976
>> I THINK WE NEED BOTH. 

747
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,677
WE NEED BETTER SELF-REGULATION, 

748
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,880
BUT WE NEED REGULATION AT THE 

749
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,313
GOVERNMENT LEVEL. 

750
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,081
DECADES AGO WHEN THE 

751
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,082
ADVERTISING INDUSTRY WAS FACING 

752
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,684
A LOT OF REGULATION, THEY 

753
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:40,519
FORMED A SELF-REGULATORY 

754
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,552
COUNCIL AND PUTTING FORTH THE 

755
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:44,789
IDEA THAT BIG SOCIAL TWITTER, 

756
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:45,557
ú 

757
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,992
ALL OF THEM, SHOULD GET 

758
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:52,097
TOGETHER AND FORM SOME INDUSTRY 

759
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:52,397
STANDARDS. 

760
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,299
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED ON THEIR 

761
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:54,499
END. 

762
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,867
>> IF CONGRESS SAID GREAT, WE 

763
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,402
LIKE FACEBOOK, IT IS NICE, WE 

764
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,570
HAVE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, BUT 

765
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,040
GET RID OF THE APPS THAT 

766
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,007
COLLECT PEOPLE'S INFORMATION. 

767
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,442
WOULD THAT DESTROY FACEBOOK? 

768
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,278
>> WELL, IF LAWMAKERS WERE TO 

769
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,180
DO THAT, THAT WOULD HAVE A 

770
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,881
SIGNIFICANTLY ...  

771
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,450
IT WOULD HARM FACEBOOK. 

772
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,085
BUT IT MIGHT NOT HARM FACEBOOK 

773
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,790
LIKE IT WOULD HAVE IN 2011 OR 

774
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,791
2012 AS ROGER MENTIONED. 

775
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:28,500
ALLOWING   ACCESS TO APPS. 

776
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,801
ZINGA BECAME A MULTIBILLION 

777
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,170
DOLLARS COMPANY ON ITS OWN. 

778
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,271
NOW, THE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT 

779
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,674
THE CORE PART OF FACEBOOK'S 

780
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:36,107
BUSINESS MODEL. 

781
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,475
THEY SELL ADS TO THE USERS 

782
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,676
INSIDE OF THE NEWS FEED. 

783
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:42,480
AND THE OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE 

784
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,782
INSTAGRAM AND WHAT'S APP. 

785
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,483
SO IT MIGHT NOT HARM THEM NOW, 

786
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,952
BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN 

787
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:48,386
EMOTIONAL BLOW. 

788
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,989
>> COULD IT TURN TO A 

789
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,456
SUBSCRIPTION MODEL? 

790
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,291
I STILL HAVE A YAHOO E-MAIL 

791
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:53,591
ACCOUNT. 

792
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:55,994
BUT YOU CAN PAY TO OPT OUT OF 

793
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,461
THE ADS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO 

794
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:57,796
SEE THEM. 

795
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,599
>> THE IDEA OF THE SUBSCRIPTION 

796
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,234
MODEL HAS BEEN BATTED ABOUT. 

797
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:08,473
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE WANTS TO 

798
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,474
PAY FOR FACEBOOK. 

799
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,910
THE PROBLEM IS, THE PEOPLE TALK 

800
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,111
ABOUT WANTING PRIVACY, BUT 

801
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,012
OFTENTIMES THEY ARE NOT WILLING 

802
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,515
TO PAY FOR IT OR TO REMOVE THE 

803
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,483
CONVENIENCE AFFORDED TO THEM. 

804
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,218
>> AND BEING A FREE SERVICE 

805
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,353
MEANS YOU CAN GET REALLY LARGE. 

806
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:23,321
THAT IS REALL ...  

807
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,424
THEY WANT IT TO GROW AT ALL 

808
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:26,657
COSTS. 

809
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,693
>> FROM IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF 

810
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,630
MONEY FOR GOOGLE IN THE 

811
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,432
ENTERPRISE, YOU CAN PAY GOOGLE 

812
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,034
$10 A MONTH AND HAVE AN 

813
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,501
ENTERPRISE ACCOUNT. 

814
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,702
THEY DON'T TRACK YOU IN THE 

815
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:42,674
SAME WAYS AND YOU DON'T GET 

816
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:42,907
ADS. 

817
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:47,778
>> THE  ENTERPRISE IS BUSINESS. 

818
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:48,879
FACEBOOK FOR WORK HAS NOT 

819
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:49,547
REALLY FLOWN. 

820
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,148
>> GOOD POINT. 

821
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,716
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE 

822
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,518
WILL BE ANGRY AT BEING ASKED TO 

823
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,985
PAY FOR THEIR PRIVACY. 

824
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:55,820
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT DOESN'T 

825
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,120
SIT RIGHT. 

826
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,522
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE 

827
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,323
GIVING AWAY A LOT OF 

828
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,624
INFORMATION YOU ARE NOT AWARE 

829
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,758
YOU ARE GIVING AWAY. 

830
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:02,327
SO, DO YOU THINK THE END 

831
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,829
RESULTS OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT 

832
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,031
NO MATTER WHAT, FACEBOOK IS 

833
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,433
GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT A BIG 

834
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,000
CUT IN REVENUE? 

835
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,835
I KNOW I ASKED THIS BEFORE. 

836
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,604
BUT, TO ME, IT SEEMS SO ...  

837
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,705
IT SEEMS SO LINKED THAT GETTING 

838
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:17,709
RID OF SOME OF THESE APPS 

839
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,710
COLLECTING OUR PRIVACY, 

840
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,011
COLLECTING OUR DATA MEANS 

841
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,480
FACEBOOK IS GOING THE SEE A CUT 

842
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,380
IN REVENUE? 

843
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,449
>> ZUCKERBERG HAS SAID HE IS 

844
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:29,521
WILLING TO TAKE THAT HIT. 

845
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,454
THOSE ARE GREAT WORDS. 

846
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:33,525
BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL 

847
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,726
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT IS 

848
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,192
UNCLEAR TO ME. 

849
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,328
>> IN THE LONG RUN, A MORE 

850
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:39,230
SOUND BUSINESS WILL BE 

851
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,798
ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE COMPANY. 

852
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:42,233
IF THEY INVEST NOW, SURE, SHORT 

853
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,535
TERM, THEY HAVE TO LOSE A 

854
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,104
LITTLE BIT OF REVENUE. 

855
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,106
BUT IN THE LONG RUN, THEY WILL 

856
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,041
HAVE BETTER SHAREHOLDER 

857
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,374
INVESTMENTS. 

858
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:51,342
THEY WILL BE BRINGING IN 

859
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,344
PRODUCT AND SELLING OTHER 

860
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:53,712
THINGS. 

861
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,447
WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THEIR 

862
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,948
BUSINESS MODEL AND THEIR ETHICS 

863
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,849
AROUND US RIGHT NOW. 

864
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,418
>> LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF 

865
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,020
FACEBOOK, WE ALSO HAVE TO ASK 

866
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,322
HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD USE 

867
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:04,488
IT? 

868
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,324
I SAY THAT BECAUSE MY KIDS 

869
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,224
DON'T USE FACEBOOK. 

870
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:08,359
GRANTED THEY ARE LITTLE. 

871
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,462
BUT THEY ALL WANT INSTAGRAM 

872
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:10,729
ACCOUNTS. 

873
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,330
THEY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT 

874
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,231
FACEBOOK. 

875
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,066
>> IT'S IS SAME THING. 

876
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:15,966
INSTAGRAM IS THE SAME PRODUCT. 

877
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:17,902
>> IT IS PART OF IT. 

878
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,504
>> BUT YET, THE SHEEN IS OFF OF 

879
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,206
FACEBOOK FOR THE YOUNGER KIDS. 

880
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,873
>> IT HAS BEEN FOR A WHILE. 

881
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,642
SNAP CHAT WAS THE HOT THING FOR 

882
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:24,976
A WHILE. 

883
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,544
AND I THINK IT TOOK AWAY SOME 

884
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,312
OF THE ATTENTION FROM FACEBOOK. 

885
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:30,749
BUT FACEBOOK HAS DONE A GOOD 

886
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,853
JOB OF HEDGING ITS BETS. 

887
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,055
IT OWNS A MAJORITY OF THE WAY 

888
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:37,956
WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER 

889
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,257
AROUND THE WORLD NOW. 

890
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,859
>> VERY TRUE. 

891
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,159
VERY TRUE. 

892
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,164
SO JEN, DO YOU THINK FACEBOOK 

893
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:46,664
HAS THE LEGS? 

894
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,865
>> THEY HAVE HIT THE SCALE. 

895
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,134
THEY WILL BE AROUND FOR A WHILE 

896
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,337
SO WE NEED TO PUT SOME SOUND 

897
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,537
REGULATION IN PLACE. 

898
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:55,940
AND TO SET SOME INDUSTRY 

899
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,273
STANDARDS. 

900
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:57,041
FACEBOOK IS REALLY THE ELEPHANT 

901
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,143
IN THE ROOM. 

902
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,410
WE NEED THEM TO BE LEADERS IN 

903
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,177
THIS SPACE. 

904
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:01,646
>> NOW, IF CONGRESS SAYS ALL 

905
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:06,051
RIGHT, WE NEED SOME REGULATION, 

906
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,352
MR. ZUCKERBERG WILL YOU LEAD 

907
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,253
THE TEAM IN CREATING 

908
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:09,553
REGULATION? 

909
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,323
THAT IS WHAT HE IS HOPING FOR 

910
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:12,757
RIGHT? 

911
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:13,958
HE HAS INTIMATED HE BELIEVES 

912
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,260
THERE NEED TO BE REGULATION AND 

913
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,761
HE IS OPEN TO IT BUT HE WANTS 

914
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:21,999
TO BE THE ONE IN CONTROL. 

915
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,668
>> HE SURELY HAS LOBBYISTS 

916
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,501
WRITING THE ACTUAL LEGISLATION 

917
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,738
AND TAKE IT TO THE HILL AND 

918
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,338
HAND IT OVER. 

919
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,240
THERE WILL BE AGREEMENTS BEFORE 

920
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,107
THIS GETS PUT FORTH. 

921
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:31,976
>> IS THAT LIKELY TO HAPPEN 

922
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:36,548
THAT CONGRESS WILL ACCEPT HIS 

923
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,181
VERSION OF REGULATIONS? 

924
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:38,349
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS LIKELY 

925
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,884
CONGRESS WILL ACCEPT THE THINGS 

926
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,087
FACEBOOK WANTS TO DO SIMPLY 

927
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:44,756
BECAUSE CONGRESS DOESN'T HAVE 

928
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,857
THE TECH UNDERSTANDING TO 

929
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,259
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NUTS AND 

930
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,928
BOLTS OF WHAT FACEBOOK SELF-

931
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,362
REGULATION WOULD LOOK LIKE. 

932
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,864
BUT, ONE THING THAT IS REALLY 

933
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,766
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS 

934
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,968
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO 

935
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,503
UNDERSTAND THE TECH NUTS AND 

936
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:05,677
BOLTS IN  ORDER TO HAVE YOUR 

937
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,379
PRIVACY PROTECTED AND WHETHER 

938
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,582
YOU ARE TECH SAVVY OR NOT, 

939
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,584
THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN 

940
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:12,884
RIGHTS. 

941
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,087
GOING BACK TO WHAT  MR. COOKE 

942
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,521
AND THE UNITED NATIONS SAID. 

943
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:21,592
IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN 

944
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:22,060
RIGHT. 

945
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,494
>>  MR. ZUCKERBERG HAS ENTERED 

946
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:23,861
THE ROOM. 

947
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:25,229
HE LOOKS A LITTLE NERVOUS. 

948
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:25,696
I WOULD TOO. 

949
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:29,533
HE IS ABOUT TO FACE A PUBLIC 

950
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:33,137
GRILLING WHICH WILL BE 

951
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:39,177
UNCOMFORTABLE AT TIMES I'M 

952
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:39,377
SURE. 

953
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,113
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK IN TERMS 

954
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:42,580
OF HIS TONE? 

955
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,617
HE HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A 

956
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,785
REPUTATION OF BEING ARROGANT IN 

957
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:48,686
THE PAST. 

958
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:48,953
CORRECT? 

959
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,022
O HOW IMPORTANT IS HIS TONE 

960
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:51,956
HERE ROGER? 

961
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,192
>> IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. 

962
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:59,564
HE WILL NEED TO SHOW 

963
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,567
CONTRITION. 

964
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,268
SHOW SOME HUMILITY. 

965
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:07,171
AND, HE HASN'T BEEN THAT GREAT 

966
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:07,638
AT COMMUNICATING. 

967
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:09,807
HE HAS OFTEN BEEN TONE DEAF AT 

968
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,508
COMMUNICATING HIS POINTS. 

969
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:16,714
SO HE HAS TO GET PAST THAT. 

970
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,483
>> WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN GET A 

971
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,020
GOOD SHOT OF HIM ONCE THE STILL 

972
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,387
PHOTOGRAPHERS. 

973
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,621
>> A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN 

974
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,488
FACEBOOK LIVE ISN'T IT? 

975
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:28,726
>> IT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 

976
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:28,959
INDEED. 

977
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,661
YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT. 

978
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,597
FACEBOOK HAS SO MANY 

979
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,131
INITIATIVES. 

980
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,699
FACEBOOK LIVE. 

981
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,302
IT IS FINDING A WAY TO HAVE NEW 

982
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:37,702
REVENUE STREAMS. 

983
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,838
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF NEW 

984
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:49,213
DIRECTIONS THAT IT IS FEELING 

985
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:49,413
OUT. 

986
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,615
>> THEY WANT EVERYTHING TO GO 

987
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,449
TO LIVE VIDEO. 

988
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,318
THEN ALL THE MURDERS GETTING 

989
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,218
CAPTURED ON FILM. 

990
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,520
ALL OF THESE TERRIBLE 

991
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,822
CONSEQUENCES THEY NEVER THOUGHT 

992
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:58,656
ABOUT. 

993
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,592
THEY HAVE HAD TO BACK OFF. 

994
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,193
THAT HAS BEEN THEIR HISTORY. 

995
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:05,295
THE CYCLE OF PUTTING OUT NEW 

996
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:06,898
FEATURES AND THEN DEALING WITH 

997
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:07,531
THE CONSEQUENCES. 

998
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:13,805
>> FACEBOOK LIVE IS A PERFECT 

999
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,539
EXAMPLE OF THE HARM THAT CAN 

1000
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,909
OCCUR, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, 

1001
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,543
FACEBOOK GOING COUNTER TO WHAT 

1002
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,913
THE NARRATIVE MAY BE. 

1003
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:22,980
THEY HIT 3.5 MILLION STREAMS ON 

1004
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,414
FACEBOOK LIVE. 

1005
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,416
>> I HATE TO CUT YOU OFF. 

1006
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,117
BUT MARK ZUCKERBERG IS 

1007
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,418
BEGINNING TO SPEAK SO LET'S 

1008
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,185
LISTEN IN. 

1009
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:33,524
>> SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY AND THE 

1010
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,127
USE AND ABUSE OF DATA. 

1011
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,028
THOUGH NOT UNPRECEDENTED, THIS 

1012
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:44,101
IS A UNIQUE HEARING. 

1013
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,203
THE ISSUES WE WILL CONSIDER 

1014
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,871
RANGE FROM DATA PRIVACY AND 

1015
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,673
SECURITY TO CONSUMER PROTECTION 

1016
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,541
AND THE FEDERAL TRADE 

1017
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,909
COMMISSION ENFORCEMENT TOUCHING 

1018
00:31:51,909 --> 00:32:01,152
ON JURISDICTIONS OF THESE TWO 

1019
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:01,519
COMMITTEES. 

1020
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,022
WE HAVE 44 MEMBERS BETWEEN OUR 

1021
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:04,389
TWO COMMITTEES. 

1022
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,224
THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LARGE 

1023
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,658
GROUP IN FACEBOOK STANDARDS BUT 

1024
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:08,759
IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR A HEARING 

1025
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,861
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 

1026
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:13,731
WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO KEEP 

1027
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,733
THINGS MOVING EFFICIENTLY GIVEN 

1028
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,166
OUR CIRCUMSTANCES. 

1029
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,635
WE WILL BEGIN WITH OPENING 

1030
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,004
STATEMENTS FROM THE CHAIRMAN 

1031
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,906
AND RANKING MEMBERS OF EACH 

1032
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:26,444

WE WILL THEN MOVE ONTO

00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:34,552
QUESTIONING. 

1038
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:35,453
EACH MEMBER WILL HAVE FIVE 

1039
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,422
MEMBERS TO QUESTION WITNESSES 

1040
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,058
I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE 

1041
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:44,962
MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES THAT 

1042
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:47,432
TIME LIMITS WILL BE AND MUSTILY 

1043
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,366
STRICTLY ENFORCED GIVEN THE 

1044
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:53,304
NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE HERE 

1045
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:53,537
TODAY. 

1046
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:54,906
IF YOU ARE OVER YOUR TIME, THE 

1047
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,007
CHAIRMAN AND I WILL MAKE SURE 

1048
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:56,840
TO LET YOU KNOW. 

1049
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,145
THERE WILL NOT BE A SECOND 

1050
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:01,946
ROUND AS WELL. 

1051
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,448
THERE WILL BE THE USUAL FOLLOW 

1052
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,251
UP WRITTEN QUESTIONS FOR THE 

1053
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:07,652
RECORD. 

1054
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,820
QUESTIONING WILL ALTERNATE 

1055
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,356
BETWEEN MAJORITY AND MINORITY 

1056
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:12,789
BETWEEN COMMITTEES. 

1057
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:15,860
WE WILL PROCEED IN ORDER BASED 

1058
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,962
ON RESPECTIVE COMMITTEE 

1059
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:18,262
SENIORITY. 

1060
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,564
WE WILL ANTICIPATE A COUPLE OF 

1061
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,033
SHORT BREAKS LATER IN THE 

1062
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:22,333

1063
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:29,340
AND, SO, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO

OPENING STATEMENT. 

1067
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,479
>> THANK YOU.

00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,848
TODAY'S HEAR SERGEANT 

1069
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,215
EXTRAORDINARY. 

1070
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,649
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO HOLD A 

1071
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:42,553
JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING. 

1072
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,955
IT IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY TO 

1073
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,957
HAVE A SINGLE CEO TESTIFY 

1074
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,958

1075
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,192
UNITED STATES SENATE. 

1076
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,561
BUT THEN FACEBOOK IS PRETTY 

1077
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:50,928
EXTRAORDINARY. 

1078
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,263
MORE THAN TWO BILLION PEOPLE 

1079
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,898
USE FACEBOOK EVERY MONTH. 

1080
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:57,068
1.4BILLION PEOPLE USE IT EVERY 

1081
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:57,268
DAY. 

1082
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,638
MORE THAN THE POPULATION OF ANY 

1083
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,338
COUNTRY ON EARTH EXCEPT CHINA, 

1084
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,975
AND MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE

00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:04,942
POPULATION OF THE UNITED 

1086
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:05,243
STATES. 

1087
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,979
IT IS ALSO MORE THAN 1500 TIMES 

1088
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,681
THE POPULATION OF MY HOME STATE 

1089
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,815

1090
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,985
PLUS, ROUGHLY 45% OF AMERICAN

00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:15,786
ADULTS REPORT GETTING AT LEAST 

1092
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:18,489
SOME OF THEIR NEWS FROM 

1093
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:18,755
FACEBOOK. 

1094
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:19,889
IN MANY RESPECTS, FACEBOOK'S 

1095
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,759
INCREDIBLE REACH IS WHY WE ARE 

1096
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,192
HERE TODAY. 

1097
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:23,561
WE ARE HEAR BECAUSE OF WHAT 

1098
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,163
YOU,  MR. ZUCKERBERG HAS 

1099
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,297
DESCRIBED AS A BREACH OF TRUST. 

1100
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:30,268
A QUIZ APP USED BY 

1101
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,902
APPROXIMATELY 300,000 PEOPLE 

1102
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,138
LED TO INFORMATION ABOUT 87 

1103
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,340
MILLION FACEBOOK USERS BEING 

1104
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,476
OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY 

1105
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,143
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 

1106
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,179
THERE ARE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS 

1107
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,746
ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF CAMBRIDGE 

1108
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,382
ANALYTICA AND WE EXPECT TO HOLD 

1109
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:47,385
A FUTURE HEARING ON THEM AND 

1110
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:47,752
SIMILAR FIRMS. 

1111
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,155
BUT, AS YOU HAVE SAID, THIS IS 

1112
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,759
NOT LIKELY TO BE AN ISOLATED 

1113
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,092
INCIDENT. 

1114
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,094
A FACT DEMONSTRATED BY 

1115
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:57,995
FACEBOOK'S SUSPENSION OF 

1116
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,932
ANOTHER FIRM LATER IN WEEKEND. 

1117
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:02,800
YOU PROMISED WHEN FACEBOOK 

1118
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,869
FOUND OTHER APPS WITH ACCESS TO 

1119
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,673
HUGE AMOUNTS OF USER DATA, YOU 

1120
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,274
WILL BAN THEM AND TELL THOSE 

1121
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,643
AFFECTED AND THAT IS 

1122
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,644
APPROPRIATE BUT IT IS NOT 

1123
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,180
LIKELY TO BE ENOUGH FOR THE 

1124
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,613
FACEBOOK USERS. 

1125
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:17,782
ONE REASON SO MANY PEOPLE ARE 

1126
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,483
WORRIED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IS 

1127
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:23,087
BECAUSE OF WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT 

1128
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,322
HOW IT WORKS. 

1129
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:26,891
THE IDEA FOR EVERY PERSON WHO 

1130
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,126
DECIDED TO TRY AN APP. 

1131
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:29,894
INFORMATION ABOUT 300 OTHER 

1132
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,295
PEOPLE WAS SCRAPED FROM YOUR 

1133
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,066
SERVICES TO PUT IT MILDLY. 

1134
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,501
DISTURBING. 

1135
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,770
AND, THE FACT THOSE 87 MILLION 

1136
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,272
PEOPLE MAY HAVE TECHNICALLY 

1137
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,407
CONSENTED TO MAKING THEIR DATA 

1138
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,710
AVAILABLE DOESN'T MAKE PEOPLE 

1139
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,244
FEEL ANY BETTER. 

1140
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,845
THE REVELATION THAT MALICIOUS 

1141
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:51,282
ACTORS WERE ABLE TO USE 

1142
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,685
FACEBOOK'S DEFAULT SETTINGS TO 

1143
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,686
MATCH E-MAIL ADDRESSES AND 

1144
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,822
PHONE NUMBERS ON THE DARK WEB 

1145
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,890
TO PUBLIC FACEBOOK PROFILES 

1146
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,292
POTENTIALLY AFFECTING ALL 

1147
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,927
FACEBOOK USERS ONLY ADDS FUEL 

1148
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:03,494
TO THE FIRE. 

1149
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,196
WHAT BINDS THE TWO INCIDENTS IS 

1150
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,697
THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE CAUSED 

1151
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,201
BY THE KIND OF NEGLIGENCE THAT 

1152
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,702
CAUSING TYPICAL DATA BREACHES 

1153
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,002
TO HAPPEN. 

1154
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:13,270
INSTEAD, THEY BOTH APPEAR TO BE 

1155
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,872
THE RESULT OF PEOPLE EXPLOITING 

1156
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:18,009
THE VERY TOOLS YOU HAVE CREATED 

1157
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,743
TO MANIPULATE USER INFORMATION. 

1158
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,112
I KNOW FACEBOOK HAS TAKEN 

1159
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,213
SEVERAL STEPS AND INTENDS TO 

1160
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:27,318
TAKE MORE TO ADDRESS THESE 

1161
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:27,718
ISSUES. 

1162
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:28,819
NEVERTHELESS, SOME HAVE WARNED 

1163
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,022
THE ACTIONS FACEBOOK IS TAKING 

1164
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:37,495
TO ENSURE THIRD PARTIES DON'T 

1165
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,197
OBTAIN DATA, WHILE NECESSARY, 

1166
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:43,000
WILL ALSO ALLOW FACEBOOK TO 

1167
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,035
MARKET SUCH DATA EXCLUSIVELY. 

1168
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,370
MOST OF US UNDERSTAND WHETHER 

1169
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,373
YOU ARE USING FACEBOOK OR 

1170
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,409
GOOGLE OR SOME OTHER ONLINE 

1171
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,545
SERVICE, WE ARE TRADING CERTAIN 

1172
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,313
INFORMATION ABOUT OURSELVES FOR 

1173
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,615
FREE OR LOW COST SERVICES BUT 

1174
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,418
FOR THIS MODEL TO PERSIST, BOTH 

1175
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,420
SIDES OF THE BARGAINED TO KNOW 

1176
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,487
THE STAKES INVOLVED. 

1177
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,824
RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT CONVINCED 

1178
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,825
THAT FACEBOOK'S USERS HAVE THE 

1179
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,427
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE 

1180
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:09,993
MEANINGFUL CHOICES. 

1181
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,128
IN THE PAST, MANY OF MY 

1182
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,697
COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 

1183
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,398
AISLE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO 

1184
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,734
DEFER TO TECH COMPANY'S EFFORTS 

1185
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,103
TO REGULATE THEMSELVES. 

1186
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,637
BUT, THIS MAY BE CHANGING. 

1187
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:24,442
JUST LAST MONTH, ABOUT 

1188
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:24,975
OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN 

1189
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,011
FASHION, CONGRESS VOTED TO MAKE 

1190
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,113
IT EASIER FOR PROSECUTORS AND 

1191
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,315
VICTIMS TO GO AFTER WEBSITES 

1192
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,916
THAT KNOWINGLY FACILITATE SEX 

1193
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:33,250
TRAFFICKING. 

1194
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,621
THIS HUMAN  SHOULD BE A WAKEUP 

1195
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,389
CALL TO THE TECH COMPANY. 

1196
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:40,825
WE WANT TO HEAR MORE WITHOUT 

1197
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:47,131
DELAY ON WHAT FAST  -- FASTBOOK

FACEBOOK AND OTHER COMPANIES 

1199
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,102
INTEND TO DO. 

1200
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,604
HOW WILL YOU INFORM USERS ABOUT 

1201
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,607
THE CHANGES YOU ARE MAKING AND 

1202
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:03,147
HOW TO DO YOU INTEND TO STOP 

1203
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:03,547
HARMFUL CONDUCT? 

1204
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,149
IN MANY WAYS YOU AND THE 

1205
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,218
COMPANY YOU HAVE CREATED, THE 

1206
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:13,524
STORY YOU CREATED REPRESENT THE 

1207
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:13,891
AMERICAN DREAM. 

1208
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:14,725
MANY ARE INCREDIBLY INSPIRED BY 

1209
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,060
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. 

1210
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,328
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE AN 

1211
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,029
OBLIGATION AND IT IS UP TO YOU 

1212
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,831
TO MAKE SURE THAT DREAM DOESN'T 

1213
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,333
BECOME A PRIVACY NIGHTMARE FOR 

1214
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:29,807
THE SCORES OF PEOPLE WHO USE 

1215
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,107
FACEBOOK. 

1216
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,842
THIS HEARING IS AN OPPORTUNITY 

1217
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,745
TO SPEAK TO THOSE WHO HAVE USED 

1218
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,347
FACEBOOK AND THOSE WHO ARE 

1219
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,315
DEEPICALLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT. 

1220
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,351
WE ARE LISTENING, AMERICA IS 

1221
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:40,985
LISTENING, AND QUITE POSSIBLY, 

1222
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,853
THE WORLD IS LISTENING TOO. 

1223
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:43,854

OPPORTUNITY THIS AFTERNOON TO 

1233
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,143
LEAD THE INDUSTRY AND 

1234
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,645
DEMONSTRATE A MEANINGFUL 

1235
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,181
COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING 

1236
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:10,448
PRIVACY. 

1237
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,348
WE HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL 

1238
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,250
THAT IS ALARMING THE PAST FEW 

1239
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:13,483
MONTHS. 

1240
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:16,386
WE HAVE SEEN HOW FOREIGN ACTORS 

1241
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:18,355
ARE ABUSING SOCIAL MEDIA 

1242
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:21,158
PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK TO 

1243
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:25,663
INTERFERE IN ELECTIONS AND TAKE 

1244
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,630
MILLIONS OF AMERICAN' PERSONAL 

1245
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,865
INFORMATION WITHOUT THEIR 

1246
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,067
KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO

00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,369
MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND 

1248
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,771
TARGET INDIVIDUAL VOTERS. 

1249
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,740

1250
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,043
16th, SPECIAL COUNCIL MUELLER

THROUGH THIS 37 PAGE 

1258
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,897
INDICTMENT, WE LEARNED THE IRA 

1259
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,667
RAN A COORDINATED CAMPAIGN 

1260
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,170
THROUGH 470 FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS 

1261
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,270

1262
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,040
THE CAMPAIGN INCLUDED ADS AND

AMERICANS. 

1269
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:25,589
A MONTH LATER, ON MARCH 17, 

1270
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:29,760
NEWS BROKE THAT CAMBRIDGE

KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION. 

1276
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,337
AND, LAST WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT 

1277
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:46,109
NUMBER WAS EVEN HIGHER. 

1278
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,111
87MILLION FACEBOOK USERS WHO 

1279
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,979
HAD THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION 

1280

TAKEN WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. 

1281
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,886
SPECIFICALLY, USING A

THE REPORTING HAS ALSO 

1314
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,323

THIS BREACH IN 2015. 

1323
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,513
BUT APPEARS NOT TO HAVE TAKEN 

1324
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:31,515
SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ADDRESS IT 

1325
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,017
UNTIL THIS YEAR, SO, THIS 

1326
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,918

REGULATE AND OR REFORM THE 

1335
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,207
PLATFORMS THEY CONTROL. 

1336
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,642
I BELIEVE THIS IS 

1337
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,443
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. 

1338
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:03,147
YOU LEAD A BIG COMPANY WITH

1349
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,868

LIKE THEIR EXPANDING USER BASE, 

1357
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,753
THE DATA COLLECTED ON FACEBOOK 

1358
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,689

1359
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,158
THEY HAVE MOVED ON FROM

1363
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,366

1368
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:09,947
FACEBOOK MAKES MONEY OFF THAT 

1369
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,548

1372
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,657
UNAWARE OF THIS FACT. 

1373
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:22,359
FACEBOOK GENERATES 40 BILLION 

1374
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,561

AND INSTAGRAM. 

1378
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:33,036
SIGNIFICANT DATA COLLECTION IS 

1379
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:36,673

SERVICES OFFERED BY THESE 

1385
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,350
COMPANIES GRANT ENDLESS

OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLECT 

1387
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,353
INCREASING AMOUNTS OF

1389
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,657
AS WE GET MORE FREE OR 

1390
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:57,060
EXTREMELY LOW COST SERVICES, 

1391
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,762
THE TRADE-OFF FOR THE AMERICAN 

1392
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,366
CONSUMER IS TO PROVIDE MORE 

1393
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:02,733
PERSONAL DATA. 

1394
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:03,967
THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER 

1395
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,737
GROWTH AND INNOVATION BASED ON 

1396
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,740
COLLECTION OF DATA IS 

1397
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,040
LIMITLESS. 

1398
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,675
HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL FOR 

1399
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:22,018
ABUSE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT. 

1400
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:23,387
WHILE THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

1401
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,821
SITUATION IS COMING TO LIGHT, 

1402
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:29,092
THERE WAS A BREACH OF CONSUMER 

1403
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:32,095
TRUST AND IMPROPER TRANSFER OF 

1404
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:32,295
DATA. 

1405
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:32,895
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL 

1406
00:45:32,895 --> 00:45:34,998
HOLD A SEPARATE DATA EXPLORING 

1407
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,501
CAMBRIDGE AND OTHER DATA 

1408
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,501
PRIVACY ISSUES. 

1409
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:40,537
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THOUGH, THESE 

1410
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:43,540
EVENTS HAVE IGNITED A LARGER 

1411
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,308
DISCUSSION ON CONSUMERS, 

1412
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:46,710
EXPECTATIONS, AND, THE FUTURE 

1413
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:51,647
OF DATA PRIVACY IN OUR SOCIETY. 

1414
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:53,417
IT IS EXPOSED THAT CONSUMERS 

1415
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,818
MAY NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND OR 

1416
00:45:55,818 --> 00:45:56,586
APPRECIATE THE EXPENT TO WHICH 

1417
00:45:56,586 --> 00:46:00,290
THEIR DATA IS COLLECTED, 

1418
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,193
PROTECTED, TRANSFERRED, USED, 

1419
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:03,560
AND MISUSED. 

1420
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,795
DATA HAS BEEN USED IN 

1421
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,497
ADVERTISING AND POLITICAL 

1422
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:08,364
CAMPAIGNS FOR DECADES. 

1423
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:11,602
THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF DATA 

1424
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,072
OBTAINED, HOWEVER, HAS SEEN A 

1425
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,041
VERY DRAMATIC CHANGE. 

1426
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,509
CAMPAIGNS INCLUDING PRESIDENT'S 

1427
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,212
BUSH, OBAMA, AND TRUMP ALL USE 

1428
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,581
THESE INCREASING AMOUNTS OF

00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:31,622

1430
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,891
TARGETING AND PERSONALIZATION 

1431
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:38,395
OVER NUMEROUS PLATFORMS AND 

1432
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:38,662
FACEBOOK. 

1433
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,097
IN FACT, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 

1434
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,298
CAMPAIGN DEVELOPED AN APP 

1435
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:46,570
UTILIZING THE SAME FACEBOOK 

1436
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,071
FEATURE AS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

1437
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,573
TO CAPTURE THE INFORMATION OF

00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,274
NOT JUST THE APPS USERS BUT 

1439
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:55,478
MILLIONS OF THEIR FRIENDS. 

1440
00:46:55,478 --> 00:47:01,118
THE DIGITAL DIRECTOR FOR THAT 

1441
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,419
CAMPAIGN FOR 2012 DESCRIBED THE 

1442
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,520
APP AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD 

1443
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,923
WIND UP BEING THE MOST GROUND 

1444
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,625
BREAKING PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY 

1445
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:13,996
DEVELOPED FOR THIS CAMPAIGN. 

1446
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:15,198
SO, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE 

1447
00:47:15,198 --> 00:47:16,733
SOCIAL MEDIA TACTICS CAN BE 

1448
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,235
DEBATED SO THEIR USE OVER THE 

1449
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:21,772
PAST YEARS ACROSS THE POLITICAL 

1450
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,840
SPECTRUM AND THEIR INCREASED 

1451
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,477
SIGNIFICANCE CANNOT BE IGNORED. 

1452
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,314
OUR POLICY TOWARD DATA PRIVACY 

1453
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,417
AND SECURITY MUST KEEP PACE 

1454
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,985
WITH THESE CHANGES. 

1455
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,820
DATA PRIVACY SHOULD BE TETHERED 

1456
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,524
TO CONSUMER NEEDS AND 

1457
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,124
EXPECTATIONS. 

1458
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,492
NOW, AT A MINIMUM, CONSUMERS 

1459
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,561
MUST HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY 

1460
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,430
NECESSARY TO MAKE AN INFORMED

USED. 

1464
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,605
CONSUMERS OUGHT TO HAVE CLEAR 

1465

CLICK THROUGH CONSENT PAGES. 

1468
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:02,446
THE TECH INDUSTRY HAS AN

00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,614
OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO

THE PUBLIC'S TRUST. 

1474
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,261
THE STATUS QUO NO LONGER WORKS. 

1475
00:48:18,261 --> 00:48:18,795
MOREOVER, CONGRESS MUST 

1476
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,731
DETERMINE IF AND HOW WE NEED TO 

1477
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,735
STRENGTHEN PRIVACY STANDARDS TO

MR. ZUCKERBERG, GOOD AFTERNOON. 

1485
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:38,848
LET ME JUST CUT TO THE CHASE. 

1486
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:43,553
IF YOU AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA 

1487
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:44,821
COMPANIES DO NOT GET YOUR ACT 

1488
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,055
IN ORDER, NONE OF US ARE GOING 

1489
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:48,992
TO HAVE ANY PRIVACY ANYMORE 

1490
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,294
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FACING. 

1491
00:48:51,294 --> 00:48:57,234
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PERSONALLY 

1492
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,335
IDENTIFYABLE INFORMATION THAT 

1493
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:03,140
IF NOT KEPT BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA 

1494
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,942
COMPANIES FROM THEFT, A VALUE 

1495
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:10,647
THAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA BEING 

1496
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,049
OUR PERSONAL PRIVACY, WE WON'T 

1497
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,551
HAVE IT ANYMORE. 

1498
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,653
IT'S THE ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY. 

1499
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,555
AND, OF COURSE, ALL OF US ARE A 

1500
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,323
PART OF IT. 

1501
00:49:20,323 --> 00:49:21,858
FROM THE MOMENT THAT WE WAKE UP 

1502
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,260
IN THE MORNING UNTIL WE GO TO 

1503
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,465
BED, WE ARE ON THOSE HAND HELD 

1504
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:28,765
TABLETS. 

1505
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:33,437
AND, ONLINE COMPANIES LIKE 

1506
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,907
FACEBOOK ARE TRACKING OUR 

1507
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:41,545
ACTIVITIES AND COLLECTING 

1508
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,646
INFORMATION. 

1509
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,215
FACEBOOK HAS A RESPONSIBILITY 

1510
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,051
TO PROTECT THIS PERSONAL 

1511
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:48,952
INFORMATION. 

1512
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,753
WE HAD A GOODIES CUSHION 

1513
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:51,054
YESTERDAY. 

1514
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,958
WE WENT OVER ALL OF THIS. 

1515
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,694
YOU TOLD ME THE COMPANY HAD 

1516
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,228
FAILED TO DO SO. 

1517
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:02,165
IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME 

1518
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,968
FACEBOOK HAS MISHANDLED ITS 

1519
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:05,501
USERS INFORMATION. 

1520
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,638
THE FTC FOUND THAT FACEBOOK'S 

1521
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,975
PRIVACY POLICIES HAD DECEIVED 

1522
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,443
USERS IN THE PAST. 

1523
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:18,281
AND IN THE PRESENT CASE, WE 

1524
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,382
RECOGNIZE THAT CAMBRIDGE 

1525
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:20,984
ANALYTICA AND AN APP DEVELOPER 

1526
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:24,254
LIED TO CONSUMERS AND LIED TO 

1527
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:31,227
YOU, LIED TO FACEBOOK. 

1528
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:34,965
BUT, DID FACEBOOK WATCH OVER 

1529
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:35,498
THE OPERATIONS? 

1530
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:38,268
AND WHY DIDN'T FACEBOOK NOTIFY 

1531
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:44,040
87 MILLION USERS THAT THEIR 

1532
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,875
PERSONALLY IDENTIFYABLE 

1533
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,576
INFORMATION HAD BEEN TAKEN AND 

1534
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,578
WAS ALSO BEING USED? 

1535
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:54,684
WHY WERE THEY NOT INFORMED FOR 

1536
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,588
UNAUTHORIZED POLITICAL 

1537
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:58,855
PURPOSES? 

1538
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,891
SO, ONLY NOW, AND I APPRECIATE 

1539
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,393
OUR CONVERSATION, ONLY NOW, 

1540
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,195
FACEBOOK HAS PLEDGED TO INFORM 

1541
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:09,599
THOSE CONSUMERS WHOSE ACCOUNTS 

1542
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,099
WERE COMPROMISED. 

1543
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,468
I THINK YOU ARE GENUINE. 

1544
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:14,571
I GOT THAT SENSE IN CONVERSING 

1545
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:14,838
WITH YOU. 

1546
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,073
YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 

1547
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:22,546
YOU WANT TO ENACT REFORMS. 

1548
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,181
WE WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS GOING 

1549
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:24,914
TO BE ENOUGH. 

1550
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:29,151
AND I HOPE THAT WILL BE IN THE 

1551
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,787
ANSWERS TODAY. 

1552
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,290
NOW, SINCE WE STILL DON'T KNOW 

1553
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,691
WHAT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA HAS 

1554
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:39,896
DONE WITH THIS DATA, YOU HEARD

ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN A 

1559
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,274
SEPARATE HEARING. 

1560
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,510
I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN THUN

00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:57,246
SCHEDULING A HEARING. 

1563
00:51:57,246 --> 00:51:59,282
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT DEAL 

1564
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:03,319
OF INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT. 

1565
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:08,225
I HOPE WE CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM 

1566
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:08,492
OF THIS. 

1567
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,393
IF FACEBOOK AND OTHER ONLINE

THIS. 

1570
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:32,716
HOW CAN WE TRUST FOLKS OF YOUR

00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:36,920

1609
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,062
BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE STEPS

WE ARE TAKING TO ADDRESS THEM, 

1611
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:57,534
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT 

1612
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,668
HERE. 

1613
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,738
FACEBOOK IS AN IDEALISTIC AND 

1614
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,438
OPTIMISTIC COMPANY. 

1615
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:11,748
FOR MOST OF  OUR  EXISTENCE, WE 

1616
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,149
FOCUSED ON THE GOOD IT COULD 

1617
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:13,315
DO. 

1618
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:14,651
PEOPLE HAVE A TOOL TO STAY 

1619
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,252
CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE THEY 

1620
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:16,653
LOVE. 

1621
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:17,654
FOR MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD 

1622
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,221
AND BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND 

1623
00:54:19,221 --> 00:54:19,522
BUSINESSES. 

1624
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,257
JUST RECENTLY, WE HAVE SEEN THE 

1625
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,459
ME TOO MOVEMENT AND THE MARCH 

1626
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,860
FOR OUR LIVES ORGANIZED AT 

1627
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,128
LEAST IN PART ON FACEBOOK. 

1628
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:26,963
AFTER HURRICANE HARVEY, PEOPLE 

1629
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,766
CAME TOGETHER TO RAISE MORE 

1630
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,301
THAN $20 MILLION FOR RELIEF. 

1631
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:34,337
AND, MORE THAN 70 MILLION SMALL 

1632
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,940
BUSINESSES USE FACEBOOK TO 

1633
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,675
CREATE JOBS AND GROW. 

1634
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:39,976
BUT, IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT WE 

1635
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,011
DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO PREVENT 

1636
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,747
THESE TOOLS FROM BEING USED FOR 

1637
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,647
HARM AS WELL. 

1638
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,883
THAT GOES FOR FAKE NEWS, FOR 

1639
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:51,955
FOREIGN  INTERFERENCE AND HATE 

1640
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:52,255
SPEECH. 

1641
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:55,058
WE DIDN'T TAKE A BROAD ENOUGH 

1642
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,592
VIEW OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND 

1643
00:54:56,592 --> 00:54:59,628
THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. 

1644
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:02,265
AND IT WAS MY MISTAKE AND I'M 

1645
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:02,498
SORRY. 

1646
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:04,333
I STARTED FACEBOOK, I RUN IT. 

1647
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:09,339
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 

1648
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:09,672
HAPPENS HERE. 

1649
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:12,976
SO NOW, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

1650
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,977
ALL OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 

1651
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,079
PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE WE ARE 

1652
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,981
TAKING A BROAD ENOUGH VIEW OF 

1653
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:18,548
OUR RESPONSIBILITY. 

1654
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,583
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST 

1655
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,184
CONNECT PEOPLE. 

1656
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,986
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE 

1657
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:23,553
CONNECTIONS ARE POSITIVE. 

1658
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:24,988
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GIVE 

1659
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:25,721
PEOPLE A VOICE. 

1660
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:26,890
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE 

1661
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,491
NOT USING IT TO HARM OTHER 

1662
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,993
PEOPLE OR TO SPREAD 

1663
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:30,360
MISINFORMATION. 

1664
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,295
AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST 

1665
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,497
GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THEIR 

1666
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:34,830
INFORMATION. 

1667
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,299
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE 

1668
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,700
DEVELOPERS THEY SHARE IT WITH 

1669
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,401
PROTECT THEIR INFORMATION TOO. 

1670
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:41,037
ACROSS THE BOARD, WE HAVE A 

1671
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,772
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT JUST 

1672
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,274
BUILD TOOLS, BUT, TO MAKE SURE 

1673
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,010
THEY ARE USED FOR GOOD. 

1674
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,378
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK 

1675
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:49,879
THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES WE NEED 

1676
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,281
TO MAKE ACROSS THE COMPANY, BUT 

1677
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,484
I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING THIS 

1678
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:54,717
RIGHT. 

1679
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:57,487
THIS INCLUDES THE BASIC 

1680
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,688
RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING 

1681
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,489
PEOPLE'S INFORMATION WHICH WE 

1682
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,791
FAILED TO DO WITH CAMBRIDGE 

1683
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,091
ANALYTICA. 

1684
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:04,394
SO, HERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 

1685
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,396
WE ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THIS 

1686
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,799
AND TO PREVENT IT FROM 

1687
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:10,199
HAPPENING AGAIN. 

1688
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,370
FIRST, WE ARE GETTING TO THE 

1689
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,472
BOTTOM OF WHAT CAMBRIDE 

1690
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,440
ANALYTICA DID AND TELLING 

1691
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:17,974
EVERYONE AFFECTED. 

1692
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,276
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THEY 

1693
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,578
IMPROPERLY ACCESSED INFORMATION 

1694
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:22,712
ABOUT MILLIONS OF FACEBOOK 

1695
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:27,517
MEMBERS BY BUYING IT FROM AN 

1696
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:27,984
APP DEVELOPER. 

1697
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,018
THAT INFORMATION, THIS WAS 

1698
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,286
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE 

1699
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:31,387
GENERALLY SHARE PUBLICLY ON 

1700
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,189
THEIR FACEBOOK PAGES LIKE 

1701
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,190
NAMES, AND THEIR PROFILE 

1702
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,393
PICTURE AND THE PAGES THEY 

1703
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:37,626
FOLLOW. 

1704
00:56:37,626 --> 00:56:38,961
WHEN WE FIRST CONTACTED 

1705
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:39,896
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, THEY TOLD 

1706
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,098
US THAT THEY HAD DELETED THE 

1707
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:42,398
DATA. 

1708
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,901
ABOUT A MONTH AGO, WE HEARD NEW 

1709
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,402
REPORTS THAT SUGGESTED THAT 

1710
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:46,735
WASN'T TRUE. 

1711
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:48,304
AND NOW, WE ARE WORKING WITH 

1712
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,572
GOVERNMENTS IN THE U.S., THE 

1713
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,673
U.K., AND AROUND THE WORLD TO 

1714
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,408
DO A FULL AUDIT OF WHAT THEY 

1715
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,676
HAVE DONE AND TO MAKE SURE THEY 

1716
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:57,814
GET RID OF ANY DATA THEY MAY 

1717
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:58,114
STILL HAVE. 

1718
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,316
SECOND, TO MAKE SURE NO OTHER 

1719
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:01,718
APP DEVELOPERS OUT THERE ARE 

1720
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,019
MISUSING DATA, WE WILL NOW 

1721
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,120
INVESTIGATE EVERY SINGLE APP 

1722
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,221
THAT HAD ACCESS TO A LARGE 

1723
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,991
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE 

1724
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:08,324
PAST. 

1725
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,326
AND IF WE FIND THAT SOMEONE 

1726
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,995
IMPROPERLY USED DATA, WE WILL 

1727
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,998
BAN THEM FROM FACEBOOK AND TELL 

1728
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:15,664
EVERYONE AFFECTED. 

1729
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:16,699
THIRD, TO PREVENT THIS FROM 

1730
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,001
EVER HAPPENING AGAIN GOING 

1731
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,335
FORWARD, WE ARE MAKING SURE 

1732
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,571
THAT DEVELOPERS CAN ACCESS AS 

1733
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:22,572
MUCH INFORMATION NOW. 

1734
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,373
CAN'T ACCESS AS MUCH 

1735
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:23,873
INFORMATION NOW. 

1736
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,207
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE ALREADY 

1737
00:57:25,207 --> 00:57:26,976
MADE BIG CHANGES TO OUR 

1738
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,012
PLATFORM IN 2014 THAT WOULD 

1739
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,214
HAVE PREVENTED THIS SPECIFIC 

1740
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:32,782
SITUATION WITH CAMBRIDGE 

1741
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,917
ANALYTICA FROM OCCURRING AGAIN 

1742
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:34,150
TODAY. 

1743
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,384
BUT, THERE IS MORE TO DO. 

1744
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:39,522
AND, YOU CAN FIND MORE DETAILS 

1745
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,424
IN MY WRITTEN STATEMENT. 

1746
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:45,028
MY TOP PRIORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

1747
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,061
OUR SOCIAL MISSION. 

1748
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:47,330
OF CONNECTIN PEOPLE, BUILDING 

1749
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,798
COMMUNITY, AND BRINGING THE 

1750
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,666
WORLD CLOSER TOGETHER. 

1751
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:51,901
ADVERTISERS AND DEVELOPERS WILL 

1752
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,036
NEVER TAKE PRIORITY OVER THAT 

1753
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:57,073
AS LONG AS I AM RUNNING 

1754
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:57,340
FACEBOOK. 

1755
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,708
I STARTED FACEBOOK WHEN I WAS 

1756
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,174
IN COLLEGE. 

1757
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:02,211
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE 

1758
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:02,411
THEN. 

1759
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:03,345
WE NOW SERVE MORE THAN 2 

1760
00:58:03,345 --> 00:58:05,315
BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE 

1761
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:05,548
WORLD. 

1762
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,882
AND EVERY DAY, PEOPLE USE OUR 

1763
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:08,117
SERVICES TO STAY CONNECTED WITH 

1764
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,920
THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER TO THEM 

1765
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,421
THE MOST. 

1766
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,223
I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN WHAT WE ARE 

1767
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:14,456
DOING. 

1768
00:58:14,456 --> 00:58:16,426
AND I KNOW THAT WHEN WE ADDRESS 

1769
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,326
THESE CHALLENGES, WE WILL LOOK 

1770
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:18,928
BACK AND VIEW HELPING PEOPLE 

1771
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,129

A VOICE AS A POSITIVE FORCE IN 

1773
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:23,866
THE WORLD. 

1774
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:25,134
I REALIZE THE ISSUES WE ARE 

1775
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,371
TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE NOT 

1776
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,506
JUST ISSUES FOR FACEBOOK IN OUR 

1777
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:31,507
COMMUNITY, BUT ISSUES FOR ALL 

1778
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:32,909

BILLIONS OF USERS. 

1795
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:07,043
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THAT 

1796
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,647
DATA IS SHARED WITH THIRD PARTY 

1797
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:14,250
DEVELOPERS WHO UTILIZE YOUR

PLATFORM. 

1799
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,954
AS OF EARLY THIS YEAR, YOU DID 

1800
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:18,788
NOT ACTIVELY MONITOR WHETHER 

1801
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,957

00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,650
BREACH OF FACEBOOK'S TERMS? 

1812
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,141
INVESTIGATION INTO EVERY 

1813
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,109
HAPPENED THAT HAD A LARGE 

1814
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,210
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. 

1815
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,279
TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM 

1816
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,446
ACCESSING THIS INFORMATION IN

01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:18,715
2014. 

1818
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,016
WE BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO BE 

1819
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,150
INVESTIGATING MANY APPS, TENS 

1820
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:30,526
OF THOUSANDS OF APPS. 

1821
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:31,661
AND IF WE FIND ANY SUSPICIOUS 

1822
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:32,595
ACTIVITY, WE ARE GOING TO 

1823
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:33,730
CONDUCT A FULL AUDIT OF THOSE

APPS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE 

1825
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:35,965
USING THEIR DATA AND IF THEY 

1826
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,699
ARE DOING ANYTHING IMPROPER. 

1827
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:37,834
IF WE FIND THEY ARE DOING 

1828
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:38,768
ANYTHING IMPROPER, WE WILL BAN 

1829
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,269
THEM FROM FACEBOOK AND TELL 

1830
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:49,078
EVERYONE AFFECTED. 

1831
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,213
AS FOR PAST ACTIVITY, I DON'T 

1832
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,514
HAVE ALL OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE 

1833
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:52,648
APPS THAT WE HAVE BANNED, BUT 

1834
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:53,950
IF YOU WOULD LIKE, I CAN HAVE 

1835
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:54,917
MY TEAM FOLLOW-UP AFTER THIS. 

1836
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,018
> HAVE YOU EVER INQUIRED AN 

1837
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:56,952
AUDIT TO ASSURE THE PROPER 

1838
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:57,620
DELETION OF DATA? 

1839
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,654
AND IF SO, HOW MANY TIMES? 

1840
01:00:58,654 --> 01:00:59,756
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YES WE HAVE. 

1841
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:00,889
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT FIGURE 

1842
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:02,525
ON HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE. 

1843
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,660
OVERALL, THE WAY WE HAVE 

1844
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,394
ENFORCED OUR PLATFORM POLICIES 

1845
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:08,231
IN THE PAST IS, WE HAVE LOOKED 

1846
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:09,932
AT PATTERNS OF HOW APPS HAVE 

1847
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:24,147
USED OUR APIs AND  ACCESS 

1848
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:25,080
INFORMATION, AS WELL AS LOOKING 

1849
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,015
INTO APPS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

1850
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:26,949
REPORTED THAT MIGHT BE DOING 

1851
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:27,349
SKETCHY THINGS. 

1852
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:28,451
GOING FORWARD, WE ARE GOING TO 

1853
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,418
TAKE A PROACTIVE POSITION ON 

1854
01:01:29,418 --> 01:01:30,519
THIS AND DO MUCH MORE REGULAR 

1855
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:31,854
SPOT CHECKS ON APPS, AS WELL AS 

1856
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,754
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF AUDITS 

1857
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:33,322
THAT WE DO. 

1858
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:34,657
AND AGAIN, I CAN MAKE SURE THAT 

1859
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:35,958
OUR TEAM FOLLOWS UP WITH YOU ON 

1860
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:36,726
ANYTHING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC 

1861
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,093
PAST STATS THAT MIGHT BE 

1862
01:01:38,093 --> 01:01:40,463
INTERESTING. 

1863
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:41,764
>> I WAS GOING TO ASSUME THAT 

1864
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:42,899
SITTING HERE TODAY, YOU HAVE NO 

1865
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:43,099
IDEA. 

1866
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:48,504
AND IF I'M WRONG ON THAT, YOU 

1867
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,806
ARE ABLE -- YOU ARE TELLING ME, 

1868
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,107
I THINK, THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO 

1869
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,074
SUPPLY THOSE FIGURES TO US. 

1870
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:57,914
AT LEAST AT THIS POINT. 

1871
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,215
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WILL HAVE MY 

1872
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,349
TEAM FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU ON WHAT 

1873
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:00,883
INFORMATION WE HAVE. 

1874
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,218
>> OKAY, BUT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE 

1875
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,352
NO CERTAINTY ON WHETHER OR NOT, 

1876
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,722
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS GOING ON, 

1877
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:06,955
RIGHT? 

1878
01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:07,155
OKAY. 

1879
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:07,723
FACEBOOK COLLECTS MASSIVE 

1880
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:08,591
AMOUNTS OF DATA FROM CONSUMERS, 

1881
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,725
INCLUDING CONTENT, NETWORKS, 

1882
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:13,830
CONTACT LISTS, DEVICE 

1883
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,397
INFORMATION, LOCATION, AND 

1884
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:20,937
INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES, 

1885
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,238
YET, YOUR DATA POLICY IS ONLY A 

1886
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,171
FEW PAGES LONG AND PROVIDES 

1887
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:24,106
CONSUMERS WITH ONLY A FEW 

1888
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:25,640
EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS COLLECTED 

1889
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,710
AND HOW IT MIGHT BE USED. 

1890
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,011
THE EXAMPLES GIVEN EMPHASIZE 

1891
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,048
BENIGN USES, SUCH AS CONNECTING 

1892
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:32,415
WITH FRIENDS. 

1893
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,116
BUT, YOUR POLICY DOES NOT GIVE 

1894
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:39,722
ANY INDICATION FOR MORE 

1895
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:40,489
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OF SUCH 

1896
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:40,689
DATA. 

1897
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:41,124
MY QUESTION. 

1898
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:41,857
WHY DOESN'T FACEBOOK DISCLOSE 

1899
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:49,665
TO ITS USERS ALL THE WAY -- 

1900
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:50,967
WAYS THE DATA MIGHT BE USED BY 

1901
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:51,701
FACEBOOK, AND OTHER THIRD 

1902
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:51,968
PARTIES? 

1903
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,235
AND, WHAT IS FACEBOOK'S 

1904
01:02:53,235 --> 01:03:01,477
RESPONSIILITY TO INFORM USERS 

1905
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:02,077
ABOUT THAT INFORMATION? 

1906
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:03,145
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I BELIEVE IT'S 

1907
01:03:03,145 --> 01:03:03,913
IMPORTANT TO TELL PEOPLE 

1908
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:04,647
EXACTLY HOW THE INFORMATION 

1909
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:05,781
THAT THEY SHARE ON FACEBOOK IS 

1910
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:06,515
GOING TO BE USED. 

1911
01:03:06,515 --> 01:03:07,450
THAT'S WHY EVERY SINGLE TIME 

1912
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,584
YOU GO TO SHARE SOMETHING ON 

1913
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:09,518
FACEBOOK, WHETHER IT'S A PHOTO, 

1914
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:19,829
OR A MESSAGE, A MESSAGE IN 

1915
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:20,596
WHATSAPP, EVERY SIMPLE TIME, 

1916
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:21,697
THERE IS A CONTROL ABOUT WHO 

1917
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:22,832
YOU WILL BE SHARING IT WITH, 

1918
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:23,599
WHETHER IT'S YOUR FRIENDS, 

1919
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:24,533
PUBLIC, OR SPECIFIC GROUP.  

1920
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:25,668
YOU CAN CHANGE ALL THAT AND 

1921
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,402
CONTROL THAT IN LINE. 

1922
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,003
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE BROADER 

1923
01:03:28,003 --> 01:03:30,106
POLICY, THIS GETS INTO AN ISSUE 

1924
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,440
THAT I THINK WE AND OTHERS IN 

1925
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,709
THE TECH INDUSTRY HAVE FOUND 

1926
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:34,042
CHALLENGING. 

1927
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:34,844
WHICH IS THAT LONG PRIVACY 

1928
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,280
POLICIES ARE VERY CONFUSING. 

1929
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,581
AND IF YOU MAKE IT LONG AND 

1930
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:43,286
SPELL OUT ALL THE DETAIL, YOU 

1931
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,220
ARE PROBABLY GOING TO REDUCE 

1932
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,789
THE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO READ 

1933
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,922
 

1934
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:50,393
THEM. 

1935
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,327
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE 

1936
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,461
STRUGGLED WITH OVER TIME IS TO 

1937
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:53,396
MAKE SOMETHING THAT IS AS 

1938
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:54,330
SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE 

1939
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,166
CAN UNDERSTAND IT, AS WELL AS 

1940
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,100
GIVING THEM CONTROLS IN LINE, 

1941
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,201
IN THE PRODUCTS, IN THE CONTEXT 

1942
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:00,703
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO 

1943
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:01,804
UNDERSTAND IT. 

1944
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:02,738
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE 

1945
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:03,506
UNDERSTAND MOST PEOPLE DON'T 

1946
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,807
WANT TO GO THROUGH AND READ A 

1947
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:08,010
FULL LEGAL DOCUMENT. 

1948
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:08,577
>> SENATOR NELSON. 

1949
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:09,545
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1950
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,213
YESTERDAY WHEN WE TALKED,  I 

1951
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:12,515
GAVE THE RELATIVELY HARMLESS 

1952
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,551
EXAMPLE THAT I'M COMMUNICATING 

1953
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:20,389
WITH MY FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK, 

1954
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,524
AND INDICATE THAT I LOVE A 

1955
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:26,195
CERTAIN KIND OF CHOCOLATE. 

1956
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,997
AND, ALL OF THE SUDDEN, I START 

1957
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,664
RECEIVING ADVERTISEMENTS FOR 

1958
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:33,336
CHOCOLATE. 

1959
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,905
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE 

1960
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:42,245
THOSE COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENTS?

1961
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,612
SO, YOUR CHIEF OPERATING 

1962
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:53,222
OFFICER, MS. SANDBERG, 

1963
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,156
SUGGESTED ON THE NBC TODAY 

1964
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,091
SHOW, THAT FACEBOOK USERS WHO 

1965
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:56,025
DO NOT WANT THEIR PERSONAL 

1966
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:56,759
INFORMATION  USED FOR 

1967
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,828
ADVERTISING,  MIGHT HAVE TO PAY 

1968
01:04:58,828 --> 01:04:59,395
FOR THAT PROTECTION. 

1969
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,831
PAY FOR IT. 

1970
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:04,266
ARE YOU ACTUALLY CONSIDERING 

1971
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:11,007
HAVING FACEBOOK USERS PAY FOR 

1972
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:18,981
YOU NOT TO USE THAT INFORMATION?

1973
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,015
>> SENATOR, PEOPLE HAVE CONTROL 

1974
01:05:20,015 --> 01:05:20,950
OVER HOW THEIR INFORMATION IS 

1975
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,651
USED IN ADS IN THE PRODUCT 

1976
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:24,887
TODAY.  

1977
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,222
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN 

1978
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:26,956
EXPERIENCE, WHERE YOUR ADS 

1979
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,491
AREN'T TARGETED USING ALL THE 

1980
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,959
INFORMATION  WE HAVE AVAILABLE, 

1981
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:33,195
YOU CAN TURN OFF THIRD-PARTY 

1982
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,096
INFORMATION. 

1983
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,231
WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT, EVEN 

1984
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,732
THOUGH SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE 

1985
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:38,200
ADS,  PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE 

1986
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,104
ADS THAT AREN'T RELEVANT.  

1987
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,072
WHILE THERE IS SOME DISCOMFORT 

1988
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,840
FOR SURE WITH USING INFORMATION 

1989
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,478
IN MAKING ADS,  MORE RELEVANT, 

1990
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,212
THE OVERWHELMING FEEDBACK THAT 

1991
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,347
WE GET FROM OUR COMMUNITY IS 

1992
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:52,281
THAT PEOPLE WOULD RATHER HAVE 

1993
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,783
US SHOW RELEVANT CONTENT THERE, 

1994
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,651
THEN NOT. 

1995
01:05:55,651 --> 01:06:01,657
SO, WE OFFER THIS CONTROL THAT 

1996
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:02,257
YOU ARE REFERENCING. 

1997
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:02,958
SOME PEOPLE USE IT. 

1998
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,660
IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 

1999
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:09,698
ON FACEBOOK. 

2000
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:11,033
AND, I THINK THAT IS A GOOD 

2001
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:11,967
<font color="#FF00FF">EVEL OF CONTROL TO OFFER. </font>

2002
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:13,102
I THINK WHAT SHERYL WAS SAYING 

2003
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,570
IS THAT IN ORDER TO NOT RUN  

2004
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,871
ADS AT ALL, WE WOULD STILL NEED 

2005
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:24,513
SOME SORT OF BUSINESS MODEL.  

2006
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:25,648
>> AND THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS 

2007
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:25,881
MODEL. 

2008
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,616
SO I TAKE IT THAT -- AND I USE 

2009
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:28,284
THE HARMLESS EXAMPLE OF 

2010
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:28,584
CHOCOLATE. 

2011
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:29,585
BUT IF IT GOT INTO MORE 

2012
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,219
PERSONAL THINGS, COMMUNICATING 

2013
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,454
WITH FRIENDS, AND I WANT TO CUT 

2014
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:32,788
IT OFF, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO 

2015
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:37,827
PAY YOU IN ORDER NOT TO SEND 

2016
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,127
ME, USING MY PERSONAL 

2017
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:40,629
INFORMATION, SOMETHING THAT I 

2018
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,898
DON'T WANT. 

2019
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,466
THAT, IN ESSENCE, IS WHAT I 

2020
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:54,143
UNDERSTAND MS. SANDBERG TO SAY. 

2021
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:54,709
IS THAT CORRECT? 

2022
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:55,277
>> YES, SENATOR. 

2023
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,412
ALTHOUGH, TO BE CLEAR, WE DON'T 

2024
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:57,346
OFFER AN OPTION TODAY FOR 

2025
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,716
PEOPLE TO PAY  FOR NOT SHOWING 

2026
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:00,916
ADS. 

2027
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:01,850
WE THINK AN AD SUPPORTED 

2028
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:02,785
SERVICE IS THE BEST CONNECTION 

2029
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,352
TO THE WORLD. 

2030
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,020
BECAUSE WE WANT TO OFFER  A 

2031
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:05,955
FREE SERVICE THAT EVERYONE CAN 

2032
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:06,188
AFFORD. 

2033
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,289
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN 

2034
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,725
REACH BILLIONS OF PEOPLE. 

2035
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:10,659
>> THEREFORE, YOU CONSIDER MY 

2036
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,393
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA, 

2037
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:16,265
THE COMPANY'S DATA, NOT MY 

2038
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:16,465
DATA. 

2039
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,032
IS THAT IT? 

2040
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:21,670
>> NO, SENATOR. 

2041
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,805
ACTUALLY, THE FIRST LINE OF OUR 

2042
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:23,939
TERMS OF SERVICE SAY THAT YOU 

2043
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:24,873
CONTROL AND ON THE INFORMATION 

2044
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:26,474
AND CONTENT THAT YOU PUT ON 

2045
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:27,910
FACEBOOK. 

2046
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,480
>> WELL, THE RECENT SCANDAL IS 

2047
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,483
OBVIOUSLY FRUSTRATING, NOT ONLY 

2048
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:38,387
BECAUSE IT AFFECTED 87 MILLION, 

2049
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,722
BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE PART 

2050
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:52,468
OF A PATTERN OF LAX DATA 

2051
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,402
PRACTICES BY THE COMPANY GOING 

2052
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:53,769
BACK YEARS. 

2053
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,070
SO, BACK IN 2011, THERE WAS A 

2054
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:55,971
SETTLEMENT WITH THE FTC, AND 

2055
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:56,939
NOW WE DISCOVER YET ANOTHER 

2056
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,040
INCIDENCE, WHERE THE  DATA WAS 

2057
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:02,011
FAILED TO BE PROTECTED. 

2058
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:02,778
WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THE 

2059
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:03,512
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA THAT HAD 

2060
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,847
FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED ALL OF 

2061
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,148
THIS INFORMATION, WHY DIDN'T 

2062
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:13,289
YOU INFORM THOSE 87 MILLION? 

2063
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,157
>> WHEN WE LEARNED IN 2015 THAT 

2064
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:18,526
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA HAD BOUGHT 

2065
01:08:18,526 --> 01:08:20,095
DATA FROM AN APPLE DEVELOPER ON 

2066
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:27,536
FACEBOOK THAT PEOPLE HAD SHARED 

2067
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:28,603
IT WITH, WE DID TAKE ACTION. 

2068
01:08:28,603 --> 01:08:29,939
WE TOOK DOWN THE APP, AND WE 

2069
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:30,872
DEMANDED THAT BOTH THE APP 

2070
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:31,439
DEVELOPER AND CAMBRIDGE 

2071
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,408
ANALYTICA DELETE AND STOP USING 

2072
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:40,849
ANY DATA THAT THEY HAD. 

2073
01:08:40,849 --> 01:08:41,951
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY DID 

2074
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:42,151
THIS. 

2075
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:43,285
IN RETROSPECT, IT WAS CLEARLY A 

2076
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,386
MISTAKE TO BELIEVE THEM AND WE 

2077
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,321
SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED UP AND 

2078
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:46,287
DONE A FULL AUDIT THEN. 

2079
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:47,890
AND THAT IS NOT A MISTAKE THAT 

2080
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:48,223
WE WILL MAKE. 

2081
01:08:48,223 --> 01:08:49,457
>> YES, YOU DID THAT, AND YOU 

2082
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:50,024
APOLOGIZED FOR IT. 

2083
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:54,330
BUT, YOU DIDN'T NOTIFY THEM. 

2084
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,631
AND, DO YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE 

2085
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,466
AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY 

2086
01:08:58,466 --> 01:09:03,305
87 MILLION FACEBOOK USERS? 

2087
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,439
>> SENATOR, WHEN WE HEARD BACK 

2088
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,341
FROM CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, THAT 

2089
01:09:06,341 --> 01:09:07,475
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY WEREN'T 

2090
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,345
USING THE DATA AND THEY DELETED 

2091
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:19,654
IT, WE CONSIDERED THAT A CLOSED 

2092
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:19,854
CASE. 

2093
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:20,788
IN RETROSPECT, THAT WAS CLEARLY 

2094
01:09:20,788 --> 01:09:21,156
<u> MISTAKE. </u>

2095
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:22,091
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THEIR 

2096
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,392
WORD FOR IT AND WE HAVE UPDATED 

2097
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:24,526
POLICIES TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T 

2098
01:09:24,526 --> 01:09:25,260
MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. 

2099
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:33,135
>> DID ANYBODY NOTIFY THE FTC? 

2100
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:33,702
>> NO, SENATOR. 

2101
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:34,603
FOR THE SAME REASON, WE 

2102
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,638
CONSIDERED IT A CLOSED CASE. 

2103
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:36,104
>> SENATOR THUNE. 

2104
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:37,238
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, WOULD YOU DO 

2105
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:37,973
THAT  DIFFERENTLY TODAY? 

2106
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:46,849
úIN RE 

2107
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,950
QUESTION, HAVING TO DO IT OVER? 

2108
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:48,317
>> YES. 

2109
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,652
>> THIS MAY BE YOUR FIRST TIME 

2110
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:50,586
TO APPEAR BEFORE CONGRESS BUT 

2111
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:51,520
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME 

2112
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,287
FACEBOOK HAS FACED TOUGH 

2113
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:53,022
QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS PRIVACY 

2114
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:53,288
POLICIES. 

2115
01:09:53,288 --> 01:09:54,156
"WIRED MAGAZINE" NOTED THAT YOU 

2116
01:09:54,156 --> 01:10:00,229
HAVE A HISTORY OF REGARDING ILL-

2117
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:00,796
ADVISED POLICIES, REGARDING 

2118
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:01,630
USER PRIVACY, NOT UNLIKE THE 

2119
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,532
ONE YOU MADE JUST NOW IN YOUR 

2120
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:08,370
OPENING STATEMENT. 

2121
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,505
AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF 

2122
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,639
PROMISES TO DO BETTER, HOW IS 

2123
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,206
TODAY'S APOLOGY DIFFERENT? 

2124
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:12,341
AND, WHY SHOULD WE TRUST 

2125
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,275
FACEBOOK TO MAKE THE NECESSARY 

2126
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:16,645
CHANGES TO ENSURE USER PRIVACY, 

2127
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,579
AND GIVE PEOPLE A CLEARER 

2128
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:18,847
PICTURE OF YOUR PRIVACY 

2129
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:26,221
POLICIES? 

2130
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:27,155
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2131
01:10:27,155 --> 01:10:28,457
SO, WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF 

2132
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:29,224
MISTAKES IN RUNNING THE 

2133
01:10:29,224 --> 01:10:29,491
COMPANY. 

2134
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:30,359
I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH 

2135
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,594
IMPOSSIBLE I BELIEVE, TO START 

2136
01:10:32,594 --> 01:10:33,896
A COMPANY IN YOUR DORM ROOM AND 

2137
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,397
GROW IT TO BE THE SCALE WE ARE 

2138
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,532
AT NOW WITHOUT MAKING SOME 

2139
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:36,799
MISTAKES. 

2140
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,633
BECAUSE OUR SERVICE IS ABOUT 

2141
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:38,867
HELPING PEOPLE CONNECT AND 

2142
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:43,438
INFORMATION, THOSE MISTAKES 

2143
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:44,540
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT, AND WE TRY 

2144
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,707
NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE 

2145
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:46,108
MULTIPLE TIMES. 

2146
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:50,579
BUT IN GENERAL, A LOT OF THE 

2147
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,513
MISTAKES ARE AROUND HOW PEOPLE 

2148
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:52,448
CONNECT TO EACH OTHER, JUST 

2149
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,048
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE 

2150
01:10:54,048 --> 01:10:57,319
SERVICE. 

2151
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,454
OVERALL, I WOULD SAY WE ARE 

2152
01:10:58,454 --> 01:10:59,221
GOING THROUGH A BROADER 

2153
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:00,155
PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT IN HOW WE 

2154
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,490
APPROACH OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS 

2155
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:07,830
A COMPANY. 

2156
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,331
FOR THE FIRST 10 OR 12 YEARS AS 

2157
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:10,265
A COMPANY, I REVIEWED OUR 

2158
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:10,865
RESPONSIBILITY AS PRIMARILY 

2159
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:11,266
BUILDING TOOLS. 

2160
01:11:11,266 --> 01:11:12,334
THAT IF WE COULD PUT THOSE 

2161
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:13,268
TOOLS IN PEOPLE'S HANDS, THAT 

2162
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:14,870
WOULD EMPOWER PEOPLE TO DO GOOD 

2163
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:23,011
THINGS. 

2164
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:24,146
WHAT I THINK WE LEARNED NOW 

2165
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,280
ACROSS A NUMBER OF ISSUES, NOT 

2166
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,415
JUST DATA PRIVACY BUT ALSO FAKE 

2167
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:27,349
NEWS AND FOREIGN -ELECTIONS, WE 

2168
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:28,449
NEED TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE 

2169
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:29,218
ROLE IN OUR BROADER 

2170
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:29,585
RESPONSIBILITY. 

2171
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:30,519
IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO BUILD 

2172
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:30,752
TOOLS. 

2173
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:33,322
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT  THEY 

2174
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,089
ARE USED FOR GOOD. 

2175
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:35,390
WE NEED TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE 

2176
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,358
VIEW IN POLICING THE ECOSYSTEM, 

2177
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,459
AND, IN WATCHING AND KIND OF 

2178
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,394
LOOKING OUT AND MAKING SURE 

2179
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:42,631
THAT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR 

2180
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:49,605
COMMUNITY IS USING THESE TOOLS 

2181
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:50,939
IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE 

2182
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:51,506
GOOD AND HEALTHY. 

2183
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,008
SO, AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS 

2184
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,143
IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WHERE 

2185
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,277
PEOPLE WILL MEASURE US BY OUR 

2186
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:55,844
RESULTS ON THIS. 

2187
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,945
IT'S NOT THAT I EXPECT ANYTHING 

2188
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,113
I SAY HERE TODAY TO NECESSARILY 

2189
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:58,647
CHANGE PEOPLE'S VIEWS. 

2190
01:11:58,647 --> 01:11:59,581
BUT I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING 

2191
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:00,716
THIS RIGHT AND I BELIEVE OVER 

2192
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:01,850
THE COMING YEARS, ONCE WE FULLY 

2193
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:02,784
WORK ALL OF THESE SOLUTIONS 

2194
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:03,719
THROUGH, PEOPLE WILL SEE REAL 

2195
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:04,052
DIFFERENCES. 

2196
01:12:04,052 --> 01:12:05,220
>> AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU ALL 

2197
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:05,954
HAVE GOTTEN THAT MESSAGE. 

2198
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,589
AS WE DISCUSSED IN MY OFFICE 

2199
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:11,960
YESTERDAY, THE LINE BETWEEN 

2200
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,594
LEGITIMATE POLITICAL DISCOURSE 

2201
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:13,462
AND HATE SPEECH CAN SOMETIMES 

2202
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,665
BE HARD TO IDENTIFY. 

2203
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,599
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN RELYING ON 

2204
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:18,199
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND 

2205
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:19,468
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE 

2206
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:23,005
INITIAL DISCOVERY. 

2207
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,106
CAN YOU DISCUSS WHAT STEPS THAT 

2208
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:24,873
FACEBOOK CURRENTLY TAKES WHEN 

2209
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:29,578
MAKING THESE EVALUATIONS? 

2210
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,512
THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE, 

2211
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,647
AND ANY EXAMPLES OF WHERE YOU 

2212
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:32,781
MAY DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT 

2213
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:38,587
IS AND WHAT IS NOT HATE SPEECH? 

2214
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:39,320
>> YES, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2215
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,456
I'LL SPEAK TO HATE SPEECH, AND 

2216
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,390
THEN I WILL TALK ABOUT 

2217
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,724
ENFORCING OUR CONTENT POLICIES 

2218
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:44,026
MORE BROADLY. 

2219
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,160
ACTUALLY, IF YOU ARE OKAY WITH 

2220
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,962
IT, I WILL GO IN THE OTHER 

2221
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:50,032
ORDER. 

2222
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,133
SO, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 

2223
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,267
COMPANY, IN 2004, I STARTED IN 

2224
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:57,506
MY DORM ROOM, IT WAS ME AND MY 

2225
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:57,773
ROOMMATE. 

2226
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:58,807
WE DID NOT HAVE AI TECHNOLOGY 

2227
01:12:58,807 --> 01:12:59,975
THAT COULD LOOK AT THE CONTENT 

2228
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:00,909
THAT PEOPLE WERE SHARING.  

2229
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:04,480
SO, WE BASICALLY HAD TO ENFORCE 

2230
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,013
OUR CONTENT POLICIES 

2231
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:05,314
REACTIVELY. 

2232
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,615
PEOPLE COULD SHARE WHAT THEY 

2233
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:11,753
WANTED, AND THEN IF SOMEBODY IN 

2234
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:12,888
THE COMMUNITY FOUND IT TO BE 

2235
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:13,655
OFFENSIVE OR AGAINST OUR 

2236
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:14,590
POLICIES, THEY WOULD FLAG IT 

2237
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:20,596
FOR US AND LOOK AT IT 

2238
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:21,063
PROACTIVELY. 

2239
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:21,596
NOW INCREASINGLY, WE ARE 

2240
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:22,464
DEVELOPING AI TOOLS THAT CAN 

2241
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,398
IDENTIFY CERTAIN CLASSES OF BAD 

2242
01:13:23,398 --> 01:13:24,966
ACTIVITY  AND FLAG IT ON 

2243
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:30,305
FACEBOOK. 

2244
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:31,807
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR, WE ARE 

2245
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:32,774
GOING TO HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE 

2246
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:33,709
WORKING ON SECURITY AND CONTENT 

2247
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,143
REVIEW WORKING ACROSS ALL THESE 

2248
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:38,213
THINGS. 

2249
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:39,348
SO WHEN CONTENT GETS FLAGGED TO 

2250
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:40,449
US, WE HAVE THESE PEOPLE LOOK 

2251
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:40,849
AT IT. 

2252
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:41,783
AND IF IT VIOLATES OUR 

2253
01:13:41,783 --> 01:13:42,918
POLICIES, WE CAN TAKE IT DOWN. 

2254
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:43,652
SOME PROBLEMS LEND THEMSELVES 

2255
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:44,586
MORE EASILY TO AI SOLUTIONS 

2256
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:49,091
THAN OTHERS.  

2257
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,392
SO, HATE SPEECH IS ONE OF THE 

2258
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:50,659
HARDEST. 

2259
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:51,159
BECAUSE DETERMINING IF 

2260
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:52,094
SOMETHING IS HATE SPEECH IS 

2261
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,395
VERY LINGUISTICALLY NUANCED. 

2262
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:53,628
RIGHT? 

2263
01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:57,232
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND, WHAT IS 

2264
01:13:57,232 --> 01:14:01,170
A SLUR, AND WHETHER SOMETHING 

2265
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,004
IS HATEFUL, NOT JUST IN 

2266
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:02,938
ENGLISH, BUT THE MAJORITY OF 

2267
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:15,717
PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK USE IT IN 

2268
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:16,485
LANGUAGES THAT ARE DIFFERENT 

2269
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,019
ACROSS THE WORLD. 

2270
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:17,953
YOU CAN CONTRAST THAT, FOR 

2271
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:18,887
EXAMPLE, IN AN AREA LIKE 

2272
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:19,487
FINDING TERRORIST PROPAGANDA, 

2273
01:14:19,487 --> 01:14:20,422
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN VERY 

2274
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:21,156
SUCCESSFUL AT DEPLOYING AI 

2275
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:21,723
TOOLS ON ALREADY. 

2276
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,225
TODAY AS WE SAID HERE,  95% OF 

2277
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,426
THE ISIS AND AL QAEDA CONTENT 

2278
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:25,494
THAT WE TAKE DOWN ON FACEBOOK, 

2279
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:28,664
OUR AI SYSTEMS FLAG IT  BEFORE 

2280
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:29,398
ANY HUMAN SEES IT. 

2281
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,799
THAT IS A SUCCESS IN ROLLING 

2282
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:31,466
OUT AI TOOLS THAT CAN 

2283
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:32,401
PROACTIVELY POLICE AND ENFORCE  

2284
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:37,039
SAFETY ACROSS THE COMMUNITY. 

2285
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:37,806
HATE SPEECH, I'M OPTIMISTIC, 

2286
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,208
THAT OVER A 5 TO 10 YEAR 

2287
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:47,382
PERIOD, WE WILL HAVE AI TOOLS  

2288
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:48,717
THAT CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE 

2289
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,450
LINGUISTIC NUANCES OF DIFFERENT 

2290
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:50,586
TYPES OF CONTENT, TO BE MORE 

2291
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:51,520
ACCURATE IN FLAGGING THINGS FOR 

2292
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:51,887
OUR SYSTEMS. 

2293
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:53,021
BUT TODAY, WE ARE JUST NOT 

2294
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:53,589
THERE ON THAT. 

2295
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:57,793
A LOT OF THIS IS STILL REACTIVE.

2296
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:58,927
PEOPLE WILL FLAG AT US. 

2297
01:14:58,927 --> 01:14:59,962
WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT IT. 

2298
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,263
WE HAVE POLICIES TO TRY TO MAKE 

2299
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:02,197
IT NOT AS OBJECTIVE AS 

2300
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:02,464
POSSIBLE. 

2301
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,365
UNTIL WE GET IT MODERATED, 

2302
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:04,432
THERE IS A HIGHER ERROR RATE 

2303
01:15:04,432 --> 01:15:06,335
úT 

2304
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:06,902
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 

2305
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:07,635
>> THANKS, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2306
01:15:07,635 --> 01:15:12,107
MR. ZUCKERBERG,  WHAT IS 

2307
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:12,908
FACEBOOK DOING TO PREVENT 

2308
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:13,642
FOREIGN ACTORS FROM INTERFERING 

2309
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:19,081
IN U.S. ELECTIONS? 

2310
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:19,848
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 

2311
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:20,949
THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP 

2312
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,584
PRIORITIES IN 2018, TO GET THIS 

2313
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,921
RIGHT. 

2314
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:26,755
ONE OF MY GREATEST REGRETS IN 

2315
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:27,889
RUNNING THE COMPANY IS THAT WE 

2316
01:15:27,889 --> 01:15:29,257
WERE SLOW IN IDENTIFYING THE 

2317
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:32,227
RUSSIAN INFORMATION OPERATIONS 

2318
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:32,594
IN 2016. 

2319
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:33,895
WE EXPECTED THEM TO DO A NUMBER 

2320
01:15:33,895 --> 01:15:35,130
OF MORE TRADITIONAL CYBER 

2321
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:42,137
ATTACKS, WHICH WE DID IDENTIFY 

2322
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:43,071
AND NOTIFY THE CAMPAIGNS THAT 

2323
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:44,439
THEY WERE TRYING TO HACK INTO 

2324
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:44,639
THEM. 

2325
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:45,307
BUT, THEY WERE SLOW IN 

2326
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,274
IDENTIFYING THE TYPE OF NEW 

2327
01:15:46,274 --> 01:15:46,774
INFORMATION OPERATIONS. 

2328
01:15:46,774 --> 01:15:48,209
>> WHEN DID YOU IDENTIFY NEW 

2329
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:49,277
OPERATIONS? 

2330
01:15:49,277 --> 01:15:50,579
>> IT WAS RIGHT AROUND THE TIME 

2331
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:51,513
OF THE 2016 ELECTION ITSELF. 

2332
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:57,886
SO, SINCE THEN, 2018 IS AN 

2333
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:58,654
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YEAR FOR 

2334
01:15:58,654 --> 01:15:58,954
ELECTIONS. 

2335
01:15:58,954 --> 01:15:59,788
NOT JUST WITH THE U.S. 

2336
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:06,728
MIDTERMS, BUT AROUND THE WORLD. 

2337
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:07,462
THERE ARE IMPORTANT ELECTIONS 

2338
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:08,397
IN INDIA, BRAZIL, PAKISTAN, AND 

2339
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:08,664
HUNGARY. 

2340
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:09,898
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO 

2341
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,832
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT 

2342
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,067
THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE 

2343
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:16,805
ELECTIONS. 

2344
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:17,939
I HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE THAT WE 

2345
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:18,874
WILL GET THIS RIGHT, BECAUSE 

2346
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:19,841
SINCE THE 2016 ELECTION, THERE 

2347
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:20,575
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IMPORTANT 

2348
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:21,309
ELECTIONS AROUND THE WORLD 

2349
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:22,277
úWHE 

2350
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:22,510
RECORD. 

2351
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:23,411
THERE WAS THE FRENCH ELECTION, 

2352
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:29,484
GERMAN ELECTION, SPECIAL ALABAMA

2353
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:30,152
ELECTION LAST YEAR. 

2354
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,286
>> EXPLAIN WHAT IS BETTER ABOUT 

2355
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:31,653
THE RECORD. 

2356
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:32,788
>> SO, WE'VE DEPLOYED NEW AI 

2357
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,657
TOOLS THAT DO A BETTER JOB OF 

2358
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:36,725
IDENTIFYING  FAKE ACCOUNTS THAT 

2359
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,826
MAY BE TRYING TO INTERFERE IN 

2360
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:38,393
ELECTIONS OR SPREAD 

2361
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:38,760
MISINFORMATION. 

2362
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,828
AND BETWEEN THOSE THREE 

2363
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:42,164
ELECTIONS, WE WERE ABLE TO 

2364
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:42,898
PROACTIVELY REMOVE TENS OF 

2365
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:43,665
THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS, THAT 

2366
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:44,966
BEFORE THEY COULD CONTRIBUTE 

2367
01:16:44,966 --> 01:16:47,402
SIGNIFICANT HARM, AND THE 

2368
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,705
NATURE OF THESE ATTACKS, THOUGH,

2369
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,372
IS THAT, THERE ARE PEOPLE IN 

2370
01:16:51,372 --> 01:16:56,978
RUSSIA WHOSE JOB IT IS TO TRY 

2371
01:16:56,978 --> 01:16:57,879
TO EXPLOIT OUR SYSTEMS AND 

2372
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:58,647
OTHER INTERNET SYSTEMS AND 

2373
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:05,954
OTHER SYSTEMS AS WELL. 

2374
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,155
SO, THIS IS AN ARMS RACE. 

2375
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,223
THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP GETTING 

2376
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,524
BETTER AT THIS AND WE NEED TO 

2377
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:10,659
KEEP IN BEST ON GETTING BETTER 

2378
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:11,193
AT THIS, TOO. 

2379
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:12,160
WHICH IS WHY I MENTIONED 

2380
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,295
BEFORE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 

2381
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,229
MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE WORKING 

2382
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,163
ON SECURITY AND CONTENT REVIEW 

2383
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:15,696
ACROSS THE COMPANY. 

2384
01:17:15,696 --> 01:17:17,332
>> SPEAK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT 

2385
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:18,900
AUTOMATED BOTS THAT SPREAD 

2386
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,437
DISINFORMATION.  

2387
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:23,572
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PUNISH 

2388
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:24,339
THOSE THAT EXPLOIT YOUR 

2389
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:30,512
PLATFORM IN THAT REGARD? 

2390
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:31,847
>> WELL, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO 

2391
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:32,781
HAVE A FAKE ACCOUNT ON 

2392
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:33,048
FACEBOOK. 

2393
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,348
YOUR CONTENT HAS TO BE 

2394
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:35,951
AUTHENTIC. 

2395
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,085
SO, WE BUILD TECHNICAL TOOLS TO 

2396
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,220
TRY TO IDENTIFY WHEN PEOPLE ARE 

2397
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:47,028
CREATING FAKE ACCOUNTS. 

2398
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:47,763
ESPECIALLY LARGE NETWORKS LIKE 

2399
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:48,897
THE RUSSIANS HAVE, IN ORDER TO 

2400
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:49,831
REMOVE ALL OF THAT CONTENT. 

2401
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:50,766
AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION, OUR 

2402
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:51,700
TOP PRIORITY WAS PROTECTING THE 

2403
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,467
INTEGRITY OF OTHER ELECTIONS 

2404
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:53,101
AROUND THE WORLD. 

2405
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,536
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAD A 

2406
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:56,004
PARALLEL EFFORT TO TRACE BACK 

2407
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,506
TO RUSSIA THE IRA ACTIVITY AS 

2408
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:02,577
PART OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 

2409
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:03,712
THAT DID THIS ACTIVITY IN 2016. 

2410
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:04,846
AND, JUST LAST WEEK, WE WERE 

2411
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:10,852
ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT A NUMBER 

2412
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:11,619
OF RUSSIAN MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS 

2413
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:12,521
THAT WERE SANCTIONED BY THE 

2414
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,821
RUSSIAN REGULATOR WERE OPERATED 

2415
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:15,323
AND CONTROLLED BY THIS INTERNET 

2416
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:21,329
RESEARCH AGENCY. 

2417
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,664
SO, WE TOOK A STEP LAST WEEK, 

2418
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:23,965
THERE WAS A PRETTY BIG STEP OF 

2419
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:24,900
TAKING DOWN THE SANCTIONED NEWS 

2420
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,436
ORGANIZATIONS IN RUSSIA, AS 

2421
01:18:28,436 --> 01:18:29,571
PART OF AN OPERATION TO REMOVE 

2422
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:30,471
270 FAKE ACCOUNTS AND PAGES, 

2423
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:32,073
PART OF A BROADER NETWORK IN 

2424
01:18:32,073 --> 01:18:34,843
RUSSIA, THAT WAS ACTUALLY NOT 

2425
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:35,343
TARGETING INTERNATIONAL 

2426
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:36,344
INTERFERENCE AS MUCH AS -- I'M 

2427
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:40,749
SORRY, LET ME CORRECT THAT. 

2428
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:41,416
THAT WAS PRIMARILY SPREADING 

2429
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:41,983
MISINFORMATION IN RUSSIA 

2430
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:42,883
ITSELF, AS WELL AS CERTAIN 

2431
01:18:42,883 --> 01:18:43,852
RUSSIAN-SPEAKING NEIGHBORING 

2432
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:44,219
COUNTRIES. 

2433
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,353
>> HOW MANY ACCOUNTS OF THIS 

2434
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:50,792
TYPE HAVE YOU TAKEN DOWN? 

2435
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,893
>> IN THE IRA SPECIFICALLY, THE 

2436
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,028
ONES THAT WE HAVE PEGGED BACK 

2437
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:54,529
TO THE IRA, WE CAN IDENTIFY 470 

2438
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:58,667
IN THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS, AND 

2439
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,601
270S THAT WE SPECIFICALLY WENT 

2440
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,803
AFTER IN RUSSIA LAST WEEK. 

2441
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,505
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THAT OUR 

2442
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:06,408
SYSTEMS CATCH, WHICH ARE MORE 

2443
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:06,908
DIFFICULT TO ATTRIBUTE 

2444
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:07,976
SPECIFICALLY TO RUSSIAN 

2445
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:15,517
INTELLIGENCE. 

2446
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,852
THAT THE NUMBER WOULD BE IN THE 

2447
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:17,786
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAKE 

2448
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:18,720
ACCOUNTS THAT WE MAY REMOVE. 

2449
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,021
AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE MY TEAM 

2450
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:20,956
FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU ON MORE 

2451
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,323
INFORMATION IF THAT WOULD BE 

2452
01:19:22,323 --> 01:19:25,093
HELPFUL. 

2453
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:25,826
>> WOULD YOU, PLEASE? 

2454
01:19:25,826 --> 01:19:26,961
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. 

2455
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:28,096
IF YOU KNEW IN 2015 THAT 

2456
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,898
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WAS USING 

2457
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:36,504
THE INFORMATION OF PROFESSOR 

2458
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:37,439
COGAN, WHY DID YOU WAIT? 

2459
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,940
>> SENATOR, THAT'S A GREAT 

2460
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,009
QUESTION.  

2461
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:41,609
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WASN'T 

2462
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:42,711
USING OUR SERVICES IN 2018 AS 

2463
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:48,416
FAR AS WE CAN TELL. 

2464
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,651
SO THIS IS CLEARLY ONE OF THE 

2465
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:50,585
QUESTIONS THAT WE ASKED OUR 

2466
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:51,152
TEEN. 

2467
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:52,087
WHY DID WE WAIT UNTIL WE FOUND 

2468
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:53,021
OUT ABOUT THE REPORTS LAST 

2469
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:57,325
MONTH, TO BAN THEM? 

2470
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,660
IT'S BECAUSE, AS OF THE TIME WE 

2471
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,594
LEARNED ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITY IN 

2472
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:00,328
2015, THEY WEREN'T AN 

2473
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,096
ADVERTISER OR RUNNING PAGES. 

2474
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,197
SO WE HAD NOTHING TO BAN. 

2475
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,899
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2476
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,667
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR FEINSTEIN.

2477
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:14,409
NOW SENATOR HATCH. 

2478
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,510
>> WELL, THIS IS THE MOST 

2479
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,278
INTENSE PUBLIC SCRUTINY I'VE 

2480
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,412
EVER SEEN FOR A TECH RELATED 

2481
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,146
HEARING SINCE THE MICROSOFT 

2482
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,281
HEARING THAT I CHAIRED BACK IN 

2483
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:20,415
THE LATE 1990s. 

2484
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:21,716
THE RECENT STORIES ABOUT 

2485
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:26,388
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AND DATA 

2486
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:27,355
MINING ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE 

2487
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:28,657
RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT 

2488
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,391
CONSUMER PRIVACY, AND 

2489
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,725
NATURALLY, I KNOW YOU 

2490
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:34,262
UNDERSTAND THAT. 

2491
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,397
AT THE SAME TIME, THESE STORIES 

2492
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,531
TOUCH ON THE VERY FOUNDATION OF 

2493
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:37,465
THE INTERNET ECONOMY, AND THE 

2494
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:40,101
WAY THE WEBSITES, THAT DRIVE 

2495
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:41,336
OUR INTERNET ECONOMY, MAKE 

2496
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,238
MONEY. 

2497
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:44,539
SOME HAVE PROFESSED THEMSELVES 

2498
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,641
SHOCKED -- SHOCKED THAT 

2499
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:47,842
COMPANIES LIKE FACEBOOK AND 

2500
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:49,944
GOOGLE SHARE USER DATA WITH 

2501
01:20:49,944 --> 01:20:53,581
ADVERTISERS. 

2502
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:54,549
DID ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS 

2503
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,650
EVER STOP TO ASK THEMSELVES WHY 

2504
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,452
FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE DON'T CHARGE 

2505
01:20:58,452 --> 01:20:58,853
FOR ACCESS? 

2506
01:20:58,853 --> 01:21:02,791
NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE. 

2507
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:03,458
EVERYTHING INVOLVES TRADE-OFFS. 

2508
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,259
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING WITHOUT 

2509
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:07,462
HAVING TO PAY MONEY FOR IT, YOU 

2510
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:08,964
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT 

2511
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:10,731
IN SOME OTHER WAY, IT SEEMS TO 

2512
01:21:10,731 --> 01:21:12,701
ME. 

2513
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,834
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING 

2514
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:14,035
HERE. 

2515
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:14,970
THESE GREAT WEBSITES THAT DON'T 

2516
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,939
CHARGE FOR ACCESS, THEY EXTRACT 

2517
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:18,873
VALUE IN SOME OTHER WAY. 

2518
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:20,408
AND, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH 

2519
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,509
THAT, AS LONG AS THEY ARE 

2520
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,910
UPFRONT WITH WHAT THEY ARE 

2521
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:25,280
DOING. 

2522
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,581
IN MY MIND, THE ISSUE HERE IS 

2523
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:26,914
TRANSPARENCY. 

2524
01:21:26,914 --> 01:21:32,020
ITS CONSUMER CHOICE. 

2525
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,954
DO USERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY 

2526
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:33,888
ARE AGREEING TO WHEN THEY 

2527
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:35,023
ACCESS A WEBSITE OR AGREE TO 

2528
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,226
TERMS OF SERVICE? 

2529
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,160
OUR WEBSITES UPFRONT ABOUT HOW 

2530
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,095
THEY EXTRACT VALUE FROM USERS? 

2531
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:44,766
OR DO THEY HIDE THE BALL? 

2532
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:45,533
DO CONSUMERS HAVE THE 

2533
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:46,468
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE 

2534
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:47,201
AN INFORMED CHOICE REGARDING 

2535
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:48,870
WHETHER OR NOT TO VISIT A 

2536
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,538
PARTICULAR WEBSITE? 

2537
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:51,673
IN MY MIND, THESE ARE QUESTIONS 

2538
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,408
THAT WE SHOULD ASK OR BE 

2539
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,512
FOCUSING ON. 

2540
01:21:57,512 --> 01:21:58,479
NOW, MR. ZUCKERBERG, I REMEMBER 

2541
01:21:58,479 --> 01:21:59,414
WELL YOUR FIRST VISIT TO 

2542
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:03,518
CAPITOL HILL BACK IN 2010.  

2543
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:04,451
YOU SPOKE TO THE SENATE 

2544
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:05,787
REPUBLICAN HIGH TASK FORCE, úWH 

2545
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,822
YOU SAID BACK THEN THAT 

2546
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:08,790
FACEBOOK WOULD ALWAYS BE FREE. 

2547
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:15,897
IS THAT STILL YOUR OBJECTIVE? 

2548
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:16,464
>> SENATOR, YES. 

2549
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:17,599
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A VERSION 

2550
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:18,533
OF FACEBOOK THAT IS FREE. 

2551
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,402
IT IS OUR MISSION TO TRY TO 

2552
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:28,276
HELP CONNECT EVERYONE AROUND 

2553
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,377
THE WORLD AND BRING THE WORLD 

2554
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:29,777
CLOSER TOGETHER. 

2555
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:31,279
IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO 

2556
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,213
OFFER A SERVICE THAT EVERYONE 

2557
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,348
CAN AFFORD AND WE ARE COMMITTED 

2558
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:33,915
TO DOING THAT. 

2559
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,383
>> IF SO, HOW DO YOU SUSTAIN A 

2560
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,351
BUSINESS MODEL IN WHICH USERS 

2561
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,285
DON'T PAY FOR YOUR SERVICE? 

2562
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:40,288
>> SENATOR, WE RUN ADS.  

2563
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,389
>> WHEN EVER A CONTROVERSY LIKE 

2564
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,323
THIS ARISES, THERE'S ALWAYS A 

2565
01:22:42,323 --> 01:22:47,028
DANGER THAT CONGRESS' RESPONSE 

2566
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:48,163
WILL BE TO STEP IN AND 

2567
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:48,530
OVERREGULATED. 

2568
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,297
THAT HAS BEEN THE EXPERIENCE 

2569
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,065
THAT I'VE HAD IN MY 42 YEARS 

2570
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:58,440
HERE. 

2571
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,607
IN YOUR VIEW, WHAT SORTS OF 

2572
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:00,341
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES WOULD HELP 

2573
01:23:00,341 --> 01:23:01,076
SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THE 

2574
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:01,843
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA STORY HAS 

2575
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:02,110
REVEALED? 

2576
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:02,977
AND, WHAT SORTS OF LEGISLATIVE 

2577
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:04,079
CHANGES WOULD NOT HELP TO SOLVE 

2578
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:04,479
THIS ISSUE? 

2579
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,580
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THERE 

2580
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,947
ARE A FEW CATEGORIES OF 

2581
01:23:06,947 --> 01:23:08,216
LEGISLATION THAT MAKES SENSE TO 

2582
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:08,483
CONSIDER. 

2583
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:13,455
AROUND PRIVACY SPECIFICALLY, 

2584
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,589
THERE ARE A FEW PRINCIPLES THAT 

2585
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:15,890
I THINK WOULD BE USEFUL TO 

2586
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:16,157
DISCUSS. 

2587
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:20,295
AND POTENTIALLY CODIFY INTO LAW.

2588
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:22,097
ONE IS AROUND HAVING A SIMPLE 

2589
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:30,105
AND PRACTICAL SET OF WAYS THAT 

2590
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,072
YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE DOING 

2591
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:31,439
WITH DATA. 

2592
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:32,540
AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT 

2593
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,341
EARLIER AROUND THE COMPLEXITY 

2594
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,843
OF LAYING OUT THESE LONG 

2595
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,344
PRIVACY POLICIES. 

2596
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,479
IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT PEOPLE 

2597
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:38,213
FULLY UNDERSTAND SOMETHING WHEN 

2598
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:42,717
IT'S ONLY WRITTEN OUT IN THE 

2599
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:43,284
LONG LEGAL DOCUMENT. 

2600
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:44,219
THIS STUFF NEEDS TO BE 

2601
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,153
IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY WHERE 

2602
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,487
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND 

2603
01:23:46,487 --> 01:23:47,789
IT. 

2604
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:48,523
CONSUMERS CAN UNDERSTAND IT. 

2605
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,657
BUT THAT CAN ALSO CAPTURE THE 

2606
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:53,394
NUANCES OF HOW THESE SERVICES 

2607
01:23:53,394 --> 01:23:54,696
WORK IN A WAY THAT IS NOT 

2608
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:55,463
OVERLY RESTRICTIVE ON PROVIDING 

2609
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:56,431
THE SERVICES. 

2610
01:23:56,431 --> 01:24:03,671
THAT'S ONE. 

2611
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:04,605
THE SECOND IS AROUND GIVING 

2612
01:24:04,605 --> 01:24:05,173
PEOPLE COMPLETE CONTROL. 

2613
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:06,106
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 

2614
01:24:06,106 --> 01:24:06,707
PRINCIPLE FOR FACEBOOK. 

2615
01:24:06,707 --> 01:24:08,510
EVERY PIECE OF CONTENT THAT YOU 

2616
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:12,347
SHARE ON FACEBOOK YOU OWN, AND 

2617
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:13,281
YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER 

2618
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:14,582
WHO SEES IT, AND HOW YOU SHARE 

2619
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:14,782
IT. 

2620
01:24:14,782 --> 01:24:16,550
AND YOU CAN REMOVE IT AT ANY 

2621
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:20,955
TIME. 

2622
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:22,090
THAT'S WHY EVERY DAY, ABOUT 100 

2623
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,024
BILLION TIMES A DAY, PEOPLE 

2624
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:24,325
COME TO ONE OF OUR SERVICES AND 

2625
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:25,660
EITHER POST A PHOTO OR SEND A 

2626
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:32,600
MESSAGE TO SOMEONE, BECAUSE 

2627
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,701
THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THAT 

2628
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:34,836
CONTROL, AND WHO THEY SAY IT'S 

2629
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,304
GOING TO GO TO IS GOING TO BE 

2630
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:37,071
WHO SEES THE CONTENT. 

2631
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:37,972
I THINK THAT CONTROL IS 

2632
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:38,940
SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT AND 

2633
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:39,907
SHOULD APPLY TO EVERY SERVICE. 

2634
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:41,009
AND THE THIRD POINT IS JUST 

2635
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:41,609
AROUND ENABLING INNOVATION. 

2636
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:48,516
BECAUSE, SOME OF THESE USE 

2637
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:49,484
CASES THAT ARE VERY SENSITIVE, 

2638
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:50,218
LIKE FACE RECOGNITION, FOR 

2639
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,319
EXAMPLE, I THINK THERE IS A 

2640
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,086
BALANCE THAT IS EXTREMELY 

2641
01:24:52,086 --> 01:24:53,021
IMPORTANT TO STRIKE HERE, WHERE 

2642
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,857
YOU OBTAIN SPECIAL CONSENT FOR 

2643
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,058
SENSITIVE FEATURES LIKE FACE 

2644
01:24:57,058 --> 01:25:04,098
RECOGNITION, BUT, WE STILL NEED 

2645
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:05,199
TO MAKE IT SO THAT AMERICAN 

2646
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:06,167
COMPANIES CAN INNOVATE IN THOSE 

2647
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,468
AREAS, OR ELSE WE ARE GOING TO 

2648
01:25:07,468 --> 01:25:08,236
FALL BEHIND CHINESE COMPETITORS 

2649
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,304
AND OTHERS AROUND THE WORLD WHO 

2650
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:10,504
HAVE DIFFERENT REGIMES FOR 

2651
01:25:10,504 --> 01:25:12,307
DIFFERENT NEW FEATURES LIKE 

2652
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:12,507
THAT. 

2653
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:15,710
>> SENATOR CANTWELL? 

2654
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,010
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2655
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:22,450
WELCOME, MR. ZUCKERBERG.  

2656
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:27,522
DO YOU KNOW WHO PALANTIR IS? 

2657
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:28,456
SOME PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO 

2658
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:32,593
THEM AS A STANFORD  ANALYTICA. 

2659
01:25:32,593 --> 01:25:41,402
DO YOU AGREE?  

2660
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:41,970
>> I AGREE. 

2661
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,036
>> TO AGREE WITH HOW CAMBRIDGE 

2662
01:25:43,036 --> 01:25:44,372
ANALYTICA TACTICS ARE SAYING 

2663
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:45,306
HOW TO DO THESE CHARGES? 

2664
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:50,411
>> SENATOR, I DON'T KNOW. 

2665
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:51,512
DO YOU THINK THAT PALANTIR HAS 

2666
01:25:51,512 --> 01:25:55,850
EVER SCRAPED  DATA FROM 

2667
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:56,117
FACEBOOK? 

2668
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:57,618
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT AWARE OF 

2669
01:25:57,618 --> 01:25:58,086
THAT. 

2670
01:25:58,086 --> 01:25:58,453
>> OKAY. 

2671
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:01,856
DO YOU THINK THAT DURING THE 

2672
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:06,894
2016 CAMPAIGN, AS CAMBRIDGE 

2673
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:07,662

TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN UNDER 

2675
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:09,530

2676
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,033
FACEBOOK PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT

2677
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:13,334
SHARING OF TECHNIQUE AND 

2678

I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I

SPECIFICALLY GET WHAT YOU ARE

>> DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN,

THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO REFINE 

2694

HELP OUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 

2701

OVERALL IN SALES SUPPORT IN THE 

2702
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,582
SAME WAY THAT WE DO WITH OTHER

TRYING TO DO SIMILAR THINGS TO

INFLUENCE A PROCESS. 

2726
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:38,786
SO WHEN I LOOK AT PALANTIR AND 

2727
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,088
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND I LOOK 

2728
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:41,222
AT  WHATSAPP, WHICH IS ANOTHER 

2729
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:42,724
ACQUISITION, AND I LOOK AT 

2730
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:45,326
WHERE  YOU ARE FROM THE 2011 

2731
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,028
CONSENT DECREE, AND WHERE YOU 

2732
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:50,598
ARE TODAY, I'M THINKING, IS 

2733
01:27:50,598 --> 01:28:00,507
THIS GUY OUTFOXING THE FOXES? 

2734
01:28:00,507 --> 01:28:01,843
OR, IS HE GOING ALONG WITH WHAT 

2735
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:02,977
IS A MAJOR TREND IN AN 

2736
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:03,911
INFORMATION AGE, TO TRY TO 

2737
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:04,444
HARVEST INFORMATION FOR 

2738
01:28:04,444 --> 01:28:05,413
POLITICAL FORCES? 

2739
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,216
AND SO, MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, 

2740
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:09,517
DO YOU SEE THAT THOSE 

2741
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:10,585
APPLICATIONS, THAT THOSE 

2742
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:19,660
COMPANIES, PALANTIR, AND EVEN  

2743
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:20,595
WHATSAPP, ARE GOING TO FALL 

2744
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:21,529
INTO THE SAME SITUATION THAT 

2745
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:22,663
YOU HAVE JUST FALLEN TO OVER 

2746
01:28:22,663 --> 01:28:23,397
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS? 

2747
01:28:23,397 --> 01:28:24,999
>> SENATOR,  I'M NOT SURE 

2748
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,401
SPECIFICALLY. 

2749
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:27,535
OVERALL, I DO THINK THAT THESE 

2750
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:28,102
ISSUES AROUND INFORMATION 

2751
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:33,707
ACCESS ARE CHALLENGING. 

2752
01:28:33,707 --> 01:28:34,642
TO THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THOSE 

2753
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:35,576
APPS, I'M NOT REALLY THAT 

2754
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:36,911
FAMILIARWITH WHAT PALANTIR 

2755
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:45,153
DOES.  

2756
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:45,887
WHATSAPP COLLECTS VERY LITTLE 

2757
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:46,220
INFORMATION. 

2758
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,388
AND I THINK IS LESS LIKELY TO 

2759
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:48,356
HAVE THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES 

2760
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,457
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SERVICE 

2761
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:49,890
IS ARCHITECTED. 

2762
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:51,059
BUT CERTAINLY,  I THINK THESE 

2763
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,460
ARE BROAD ISSUES ACROSS THE 

2764
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:58,266
TECH INDUSTRY. 

2765
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,600
>> WELL I GUESS GIVEN THE TRACK 

2766
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,701
ECORD OF WHERE FACEBOOK IS  

2767
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:02,036
WHY YOU ARE HERE TODAY, I GUESS 

2768
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:03,104
PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THEY DID 

2769
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:03,871
NOT ACT BOLDLY ENOUGH. 

2770
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:05,573
AND, THE FACT THAT PEOPLE LIKE 

2771
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,174
JOHN BOLTON, BASICALLY WAS AN 

2772
01:29:07,174 --> 01:29:16,651
INVESTOR, AND THE NEW YORK 

2773
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:17,685
TIMES ARTICLE EARLIER, I GUESS 

2774
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:18,519
IT WAS ACTUALLY LAST MONTH, 

2775
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:19,454
THAT THE BOLTON PACK WAS 

2776
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:22,657
OBSESSED WITH HOW AMERICA WAS 

2777
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:23,391
BECOMING LIMP WRISTED AND 

2778
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:24,158
SPINELESS AND WANTED RESEARCH 

2779
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:24,891
AND MESSAGING FOR NATIONAL 

2780
01:29:24,891 --> 01:29:25,292
SECURITY ISSUES. 

2781
01:29:25,292 --> 01:29:29,397
SO, THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, 

2782
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:30,698
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 

2783
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,700
ARE INTERESTED IN THIS LARGER 

2784
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,836
EFFORT, AND WHAT I THINK MY 

2785
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:38,573
CONSTITUENTS WANT TO KNOW IS, 

2786
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:39,474
WAS THIS DISCUSSED AT YOUR 

2787
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:39,874
BOARD MEETINGS? 

2788
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,409
AND, WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS 

2789
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:47,949
AND INTERESTS THAT ARE BEING 

2790
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:48,716
DISCUSSED, WITHOUT PUTTING REAL 

2791
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:49,283
TEETH INTO THIS? 

2792
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:50,585
WE DON'T WANT TO COME BACK TO 

2793
01:29:50,585 --> 01:29:52,653
THE SITUATION AGAIN. 

2794
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:53,788
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ALL THE 

2795
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:54,021
TALENT. 

2796
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:54,889
MY QUESTION IS, WHETHER YOU 

2797
01:29:54,889 --> 01:30:02,196
HAVE ALL OF THE WILL TO HELP US 

2798
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:02,763
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. 

2799
01:30:02,763 --> 01:30:03,330
>> YES, SENATOR. 

2800
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:04,264
SO, DATA PRIVACY AND FOREIGN 

2801
01:30:04,264 --> 01:30:05,032
INTERFERENCE AND ELECTIONS ARE 

2802
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:05,766
CERTAINLY TOPICS THAT WE'VE 

2803
01:30:05,766 --> 01:30:08,202
DISCUSSED AT THE BOARD MEETING. 

2804
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:09,303
THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST 

2805
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:10,238
ISSUES THAT THE COMPANY HAS 

2806
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,372
FACED AND WE FEEL A HUGE 

2807
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:12,573
RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THESE 

2808
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,208
RIGHT. 

2809
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,342
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THE EUROPEAN 

2810
01:30:15,342 --> 01:30:16,076
REGULATIONS SHOULD BE APPLIED 

2811
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:29,223
HERE IN THE U.S.? 

2812
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,092
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE EVERYONE  

2813
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:31,492
PRIVACY CONTACTS. 

2814
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:32,393
AND, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE 

2815
01:30:32,393 --> 01:30:33,160
IMPLEMENT THE EXACT SAME 

2816
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,095
REGULATION, I WOULD GUESS THAT 

2817
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:34,862
WOULD BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, 

2818
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:35,596
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMEWHAT 

2819
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:36,330
DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES IN THE 

2820
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:37,298
U.S., AS DO OTHER COUNTRIES. 

2821
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:38,399
WE ARE COMMITTED TO ROLLING OUT 

2822
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:39,133
THE CONTROLS, AND THE 

2823
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:39,900
AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. 

2824
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:45,106
AND, THE SPECIAL CONTROLS 

2825
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:45,873
AROUND SENSITIVE TYPES OF 

2826
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:46,440
TECHNOLOGY, LIKE FACE 

2827
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,774
RECOGNITION, THAT ARE REQUIRED 

2828
01:30:47,774 --> 01:30:53,214
IN GDPR, WE ARE DOING THAT 

2829
01:30:53,214 --> 01:31:00,721
AROUND THE WORLD.  

2830
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:01,656
IT IS WORTH DISCUSSING WHETHER 

2831
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:02,389
WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING 

2832
01:31:02,389 --> 01:31:03,524
SIMILAR IN THE U.S. BUT WHAT 

2833
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:04,825
I'D LIKE TO SAY TODAY IS THAT 

2834
01:31:04,825 --> 01:31:06,160
WE ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD AND 

2835
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:06,894
IMPLEMENT THAT, REGARDLESS OF 

2836
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:08,261
WHAT THE REGULATORY OUTCOME IS. 

2837
01:31:08,261 --> 01:31:11,766
>> SENATOR THUNE WILL CHAIR 

2838
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:14,569
NEXT.  

2839
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:21,242
SENATOR WICKER? 

2840
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:22,643
>> MY QUESTION IS GOING TO BE A 

2841
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:23,578
FOLLOW-UP ON WHAT SENATOR HATCH 

2842
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:27,882
WAS TALKINGABOUT.  

2843
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:29,016
LET ME AGREE WITH BASICALLY HIS 

2844
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,151
ADVICE, THAT WE DON'T WANT TO 

2845
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:31,085
OVER REGULATE TO THE POINT 

2846
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:35,957
WHERE WE ARE STIFLING 

2847
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:36,524
INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT. 

2848
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:37,658
I UNDERSTAND WITH REGARD TO 

2849
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:43,264
SUGGESTED RULES, OR SUGGESTING 

2850
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:44,499
LEGISLATION, THERE ARE AT LEAST 

2851
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:45,166
TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT OUT 

2852
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:45,399
THERE. 

2853
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:58,846
ONE WOULD BE THE ISPs, THE  

2854
01:31:58,846 --> 01:31:59,580
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHO 

2855
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,348
ARE ADVOCATING FOR PRIVACY 

2856
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:01,082
PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS WHO 

2857
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:02,015
APPLY TO ALL ONLINE ENTITIES, 

2858
01:32:02,015 --> 01:32:03,351
EQUALLY, ACROSS THE ENTIRE 

2859
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,019
INTERNET ECOSYSTEM. 

2860
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:05,953
NOW, FACEBOOK IS AN EDGE 

2861
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:06,887
PROVIDER ON THE OTHER HAND. 

2862
01:32:06,887 --> 01:32:08,389
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY 

2863
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,458
EDGE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS 

2864
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:11,392
FACEBOOK, WILL NOT SUPPORT THAT 

2865
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,159
EFFORT, BECAUSE EDGE PROVIDERS 

2866
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:17,665
HAVE DIFFERENT RICHNESS MODELS 

2867
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:18,899
THAN THE ISPS AND SHOULD NOT BE 

2868
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:24,672
CONSIDERED LIKE SERVICES. 

2869
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:25,806
SO, DO YOU THINK WE NEED 

2870
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:26,440
CONSISTENT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS 

2871
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,141
FROM CONSUMERS ACROSS THE 

2872
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:30,511
ENTIRE INTERNE ECOSYSTEM THAT 

2873
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:31,646
ARE BASED ON THE TYPE OF 

2874
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:32,213
CONSUMER INFORMATION BEING 

2875
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:35,016
COLLECTED, USED, OR SHARED? 

2876
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:35,983
REGARDLESS OF THE ENTITY DOING 

2877
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:37,350
THE COLLECTING OR USING OR 

2878
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:40,655
SHARING? 

2879
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:41,589
>> SENATOR, THIS IS AN 

2880
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:42,022
IMPORTANT QUESTION. 

2881
01:32:42,022 --> 01:32:44,692
I WOULD DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN 

2882
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:47,962
ISPs, WHICH I  CONSIDERED TO BE 

2883
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:54,335
THE PIPES OF FACEBOOK, OR THE 

2884
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:55,269
APPS LIKE GOOGLE, TWITTER, OR 

2885
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:56,370
YOUTUBE, THAT ARE THE APPS OR 

2886
01:32:56,370 --> 01:33:00,107
PLATFORMS ON TOP OF THAT. 

2887
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,075
I THINK IN GENERAL, THE 

2888
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:01,842
EXPECTATIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

2889
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:02,776
OF THE PIPES ARE SOMEWHAT 

2890
01:33:02,776 --> 01:33:05,980
DIFFERENT FROM THE PLATFORMS. 

2891
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,081
SO THERE MIGHT BE AREAS WHERE 

2892
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,015
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE 

2893
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:09,150
REGULATION IN ONE AND LESS IN 

2894
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:10,284
THE OTHER, BUT I THINK THERE 

2895
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:11,218
WILL BE OTHER ISSUES WHERE 

2896
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:12,153
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE 

2897
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:13,087
REGULATION OF THE OTHER TYPE. 

2898
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,287
SPECIFICALLY, THOUGH, ON THE 

2899
01:33:14,287 --> 01:33:16,823
PIPES, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT 

2900
01:33:16,823 --> 01:33:20,594
ISSUES THAT I THINK WE FACE, 

2901
01:33:20,594 --> 01:33:21,529
AND HAVE DEBATED IS -- 

2902
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:26,767
>> WHEN YOU SAY PIPES, YOU MEAN 

2903
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:27,535
-- 

2904
01:33:27,535 --> 01:33:30,304
>> ISPs. 

2905
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:31,438
AND I KNOW THAT NET NEUTRALITY 

2906
01:33:31,438 --> 01:33:38,412
HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF DEBATE. 

2907
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:39,714
ONE OF THE REASONS I SAY THAT 

2908
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:41,215
SHOULD BE THE CASE IS I LOOK AT 

2909
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:42,516
MY OWN STORY OF WHEN I WAS 

2910
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:43,083
GETTING STARTED BUILDING 

2911
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:45,219
FACEBOOK AT HARVARD. 

2912
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:46,287
I ONLY HAD ONE OPTION FOR AN 

2913
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:47,955
ISP TO USE AND IF I HAD TO PAY 

2914
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:49,256
EXTRA IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SO 

2915
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:50,190
THAT MY APP COULD POTENTIALLY 

2916
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:51,325
ú 

2917
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:52,259
PEOPLE, THEN WE PROBABLY WOULD 

2918
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:56,964
NOT BE HERE TODAY. 

2919
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,265
>> OKAY, BUT WE ARE TALKING 

2920
01:33:58,265 --> 01:33:58,765
ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS. 

2921
01:33:58,765 --> 01:33:59,967
LET ME SAY, WE WILL HAVE TO 

2922
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:02,002
FOLLOW UP ON THIS. 

2923
01:34:02,002 --> 01:34:03,304
I THINK YOU AND I AGREE, THIS 

2924
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:04,805
IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR 

2925
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:07,074
ITEMS OF DEBATE, IF WE HAVE TO 

2926
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:08,976
GO FORWARD AND DO THIS FROM A 

2927
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:09,509
GOVERNMENTAL STANDPOINT. 

2928
01:34:09,509 --> 01:34:10,845
LET ME JUST MOVE ON TO ANOTHER 

2929
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:15,883
COUPLE OF ITEMS. 

2930
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:17,017
IS IT TRUE, THAT AS WAS 

2931
01:34:17,017 --> 01:34:17,584
RECENTLY PUBLICIZED, THAT 

2932
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:22,456
FACEBOOK COLLECTS THE CALL AND 

2933
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:23,390
TEXT HISTORIES OF ITS USERS 

2934
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:32,600
THAT USE ANDROID PHONES? 

2935
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,701
>> SENATOR, WE HAVE AN APP 

2936
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:34,468
CALLED MESSENGER, FOR SENDING 

2937
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:35,236
MESSAGES TO YOUR FACEBOOK 

2938
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:35,503
FRIENDS. 

2939
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:36,504
AND THAT APP OFFERS PEOPLE AN 

2940
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:37,438
OPTION TO SYNC THEIR TEXT 

2941
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:38,773
MESSAGES INTO THE MESSAGING 

2942
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:41,041
APP,  AND TO MAKE IT SO THAT 

2943
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:42,343
BASICALLY YOU CAN HAVE ONE APP, 

2944
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:45,346
WHERE IT HAS BOTH YOUR TEXTS, 

2945
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,847
AND YOUR FACEBOOK MESSAGES IN 

2946
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:52,853
ONE PLACE. 

2947
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:53,954
WE ALSO ALLOW PEOPLE THE OPTION 

2948
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:54,321
OF -- 

2949
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:55,823
>> DO YOU OPT IN OR OUT OF 

2950
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:56,023
THAT? 

2951
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:56,957
>> IT IS OPT IN. 

2952
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:57,892
YOU HAVE TO AFFIRMATIVELY SAY 

2953
01:34:57,892 --> 01:35:02,596
THAT YOU WANT TO SYNC THAT 

2954
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:03,330
INFORMATION BEFORE WE GET 

2955
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:03,898
ACCESS TO IT. 

2956
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:07,268
>> UNLESS YOU OPT IN,  YOU 

2957
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:08,202
DON'T COLLECT THAT CALL AND 

2958
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:08,569
TEXT HISTORY. 

2959
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:09,836
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 

2960
01:35:09,836 --> 01:35:14,408
>> AND IS THAT TRUE FOR -- IS 

2961
01:35:14,408 --> 01:35:15,542
THIS PRACTICE DONE AT ALL WITH 

2962
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:15,776
MINORS? 

2963
01:35:15,776 --> 01:35:19,280
OR DO YOU MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR 

2964
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,214
PERSONS AGE 13 TO 17. 

2965
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:21,148
>> I DO NOT KNOW. 

2966
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:22,283
I CAN FOLLOW UP ON THAT. 

2967
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:26,954
>> LET'S DO THAT. 

2968
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:27,521
ONE OTHER THING. 

2969
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:28,455
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT 

2970
01:35:28,455 --> 01:35:29,223
FACEBOOK CAN TRACK USERS' 

2971
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:29,957
INTERNET BROWSING HISTORY EVEN 

2972
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:31,091
AFTER THAT USER HAS LOGGED OFF 

2973
01:35:31,091 --> 01:35:32,760
OF THE FACEBOOK PLATFORM. 

2974
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,461
CAN YOU CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT 

2975
01:35:34,461 --> 01:35:41,769
THIS IS TRUE? 

2976
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,070
>> SENATOR, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 

2977
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:44,171
I GET THIS ACCURATE, SO IT 

2978
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:45,706
WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER TO 

2979
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:47,775
HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW UP. 

2980
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:48,542
>> YOU DON'T KNOW? 

2981
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:49,643
>> I KNOW THAT PEOPLE USE 

2982
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:50,945
COOKIES ON THE INTERNET, AND 

2983
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:51,712
YOU CAN PROBABLY CORRELATE 

2984
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:54,148
ACTIVITY BETWEEN SESSIONS. WE 

2985
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:56,851
DO THAT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS,

2986
01:35:56,851 --> 01:35:57,951
INCLUDING SECURITY, AND 

2987
01:35:57,951 --> 01:36:05,392
INCLUDING AND MEASURING ADS, TO 

2988
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:06,327
MAKE SURE THAT THE AD 

2989
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:07,094
EXPERIENCES THE MOST EFFECTIVE, 

2990
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:08,229
WHICH OF COURSE PEOPLE CAN OPT 

2991
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,596
OUT OF. 

2992
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:10,464
BUT I  WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M 

2993
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:11,031
PRECISE IN THAT. 

2994
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:12,900
>> WHEN YOU GET BACK TO ME, 

2995
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,201
SIR, WOULD YOU ALSO LET US KNOW 

2996
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:15,568
HOW FACEBOOK DISCLOSES TO ITS 

2997
01:36:15,568 --> 01:36:16,804
USERS THAT ENGAGING IN THIS 

2998
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:23,777
TYPE OF TRACK GIVES US THAT 

2999
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:24,044
RESULTS? 

3000
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:24,344
>> YES. 

3001
01:36:24,344 --> 01:36:25,846
>> AND, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

3002
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:27,915
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR WICKER.  

3003
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:32,786
>> THANK YOU. 

3004
01:36:32,786 --> 01:36:33,721
MR. ZUCKERBERG, I ASSUME THAT 

3005
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:35,088
FACEBOOK HAS BEEN SERVED  THE 

3006
01:36:35,088 --> 01:36:38,859
SUBPOENAS FROM THE SPECIAL 

3007
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:39,359
COUNCILWOMAN'S OFFICE. 

3008
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:40,294
IS THAT CORRECT? 

3009
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:45,332
>> YES. 

3010
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,900
>> HAVE YOU OR ANYONE IN 

3011
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:54,141
FACEBOOK BEEN CONTACTED BY THE 

3012
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:54,708
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE? 

3013
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:55,509
HAVE YOU BEEN INTERVIEWED? 

3014
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:56,210
>> I HAVE NOT. 

3015
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,344
>> OTHERS HAVE? 

3016
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,078
>> I BELIEVE SO. 

3017
01:36:58,078 --> 01:36:59,380
AND I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE, 

3018
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:08,756
BECAUSE THAT OUR WORK WITH THE 

3019
01:37:08,756 --> 01:37:09,556
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS CONFIDENTIAL 

3020
01:37:09,556 --> 01:37:11,191
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN 

3021
01:37:11,191 --> 01:37:11,959
AN OPEN SESSION, I'M NOT 

3022
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:12,693
REVEALING SOMETHING THAT IS 

3023
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:13,026
CONFIDENTIAL. 

3024
01:37:13,026 --> 01:37:13,460
>> I UNDERSTAND. 

3025
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,762
I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT 

3026
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:15,696
YOU HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND 

3027
01:37:15,696 --> 01:37:16,864
HAVE HAD SUBPOENAS. 

3028
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:19,632
>> ACTUALLY, LET ME CLARIFY 

3029
01:37:19,632 --> 01:37:19,833
THAT. 

3030
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:20,968
I'M ACTUALLY NOT AWARE OF A 

3031
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:21,235
SUBPOENA. 

3032
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,069
I THINK THERE MAY BE, BUT I'M 

3033
01:37:23,069 --> 01:37:33,347
NOT -- I KNOW THAT WE ARE 

3034
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:33,914
WORKING WITH THEM. 

3035
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:35,014
>> SIX MONTHS AGO, YOUR COUNSEL 

3036
01:37:35,014 --> 01:37:35,949
PROMISE THAT YOU ARE TAKING 

3037
01:37:35,949 --> 01:37:36,917
STEPS TO PREVENT FACEBOOK FROM 

3038
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:37,851
SERVING WHAT IS CALLED AN 

3039
01:37:37,851 --> 01:37:38,585
UNWITTING CO-CONSPIRATOR, 

3040
01:37:38,585 --> 01:37:39,520
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. 

3041
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,958
BUT, THESE UNVERIFIED DIVISIVE 

3042
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:47,227
PAGES ARE ON FACEBOOK TODAY. 

3043
01:37:47,227 --> 01:37:48,529
THEY LOOK A LOT LIKE THE 

3044
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,796
ANONYMOUS GROUPS THE RUSSIAN 

3045
01:37:49,796 --> 01:37:53,199
AGENTS USED TO SPREAD 

3046
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:54,435
PROPAGANDA DURING THE 2016 

3047
01:37:54,435 --> 01:38:00,540
ELECTION. 

3048
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,742
ARE YOU ABLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER 

3049
01:38:01,742 --> 01:38:02,409
THEY ARE RUSSIAN CREATED 

3050
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:02,642
GROUPS? 

3051
01:38:02,642 --> 01:38:09,516
YES OR NO. 

3052
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:10,484
>> SENATOR, ARE YOU ASKING 

3053
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:11,084
ABOUT THOSE SPECIFICALLY? 

3054
01:38:11,084 --> 01:38:11,384
>> YES. 

3055
01:38:11,384 --> 01:38:12,319
>> SENATOR, LAST WEEK WE 

3056
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:13,087
ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED A MAJOR 

3057
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:20,027
CHANGE TO OUR ADS AND PAGES 

3058
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:20,961
POLICIES, THAT WE WILL BE 

3059
01:38:20,961 --> 01:38:21,895
VERIFYING THE IDENTITY OF EVERY 

3060
01:38:21,895 --> 01:38:22,529
SINGLE ADVERTISER. 

3061
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:22,929
>> SPECIFIC ONES. 

3062
01:38:22,929 --> 01:38:24,164
DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE?  

3063
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:25,265
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE 

3064
01:38:25,265 --> 01:38:26,633
PIECES OF CONTENT SPECIFICALLY. 

3065
01:38:26,633 --> 01:38:31,038
>> BUT IF YOU DECIDED THIS 

3066
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:32,373
POLICY A WEEK AGO, YOU WOULD BE 

3067
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:33,107
ABLE TO VERIFY THEM? 

3068
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:36,343
>> WE ARE WORKING ON THAT NOW. 

3069
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:37,644
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS, WE ARE 

3070
01:38:37,644 --> 01:38:38,779
GOING TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF 

3071
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:39,713
ANY ADVERTISER WHO IS RUNNING 

3072
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:40,446
APOLITICAL, OR ISSUE RELATED 

3073
01:38:40,446 --> 01:38:40,647
AD. 

3074
01:38:40,647 --> 01:38:42,048
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT  THE 

3075
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:47,955
HONEST ADS ACT IS PROPOSING. 

3076
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:48,889
AND, WE ARE FOLLOWING THAT. 

3077
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:50,224
AND, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DO 

3078
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:55,662
THAT FOR PAGES.  

3079
01:38:55,662 --> 01:38:56,764
BUT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE 

3080
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:57,164
SPECIFIC CASES. 

3081
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:58,465
>> WILL YOU FIND OUT THE ANSWER 

3082
01:38:58,465 --> 01:38:59,967
AND GET BACK TO ME? 

3083
01:38:59,967 --> 01:39:01,468
>> I WILL HAVE MY TEAM GET BACK 

3084
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:01,835
TO YOU. 

3085
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:03,436
I DO THINK IT'S WORTH ADDING, 

3086
01:39:03,436 --> 01:39:06,507
THOUGH, THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO 

3087
01:39:06,507 --> 01:39:07,474
THE SAME VERIFICATION OF THE 

3088
01:39:07,474 --> 01:39:14,281
IDENTITY AND LOCATION OF ADMIN'S

3089
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:15,349
WHO ARE RUNNING LARGE PAGES. 

3090
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:16,716
SO THAT WAY, EVEN IF THEY 

3091
01:39:16,716 --> 01:39:17,584
AREN'T GOING TO BE BUYING ADS 

3092
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:18,719
IN OUR SYSTEM, THAT WILL MAKE 

3093
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,020
IT SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER FOR 

3094
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:26,026
RUSSIAN  INTERFERENCE EFFORT, 

3095
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:26,760
OR OTHER INAUTHENTIC EFFORTS, 

3096
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,795
TO TRY TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION 

3097
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:28,262
THROUGH THE NETWORK. 

3098
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:29,763
>> AND IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 

3099
01:39:29,763 --> 01:39:30,164
SOME TIME. 

3100
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:31,265
SOME MIGHT SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME. 

3101
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:32,399
SIX MONTHS AGO, I ASKED GENERAL 

3102
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:34,268
COUNSEL.FACEBOOK'S RULES FOR A 

3103
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:35,735
BREEDING GROUND OF HATE SPEECH 

3104
01:39:35,735 --> 01:39:42,509
AGAINST ROHINGYA REFUGEES. 

3105
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:44,211
A WEEK AGO, YOU BLAMED FACEBOOK 

3106
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:46,280
FOR  THE GENOCIDE IN MYANMAR. 

3107
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,715
AND THERE HAS BEEN GENOCIDE. 

3108
01:39:48,715 --> 01:39:50,017
YOU SAY THAT YOU USED AI TO 

3109
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:54,354
FIND THIS.  

3110
01:39:54,354 --> 01:39:55,656
THIS IS A TYPE OF CONTENT THAT 

3111
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,223
I'M REFERRING TO. 

3112
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:58,092
IT CALLS FOR THE DEATH OF A 

3113
01:39:58,092 --> 01:39:59,593
MUSLIM JOURNALIST. 

3114
01:39:59,593 --> 01:40:00,527
NOW, THAT THREAT WENT STRAIGHT 

3115
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:01,829
THROUGH YOUR DETECTION SYSTEMS, 

3116
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:04,465
SPREAD VERY QUICKLY, AND THEN, 

3117
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:08,502
IT TOOK ATTEMPT, AFTER ATTEMPT, 

3118
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:09,570
AFTER ATTEMPT, AND INVOLVEMENT 

3119
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:12,306
OF CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS, TO GET 

3120
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:21,882
YOU TO REMOVE IT. 

3121
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:22,850
WHY COULDN'T IT BE REMOVED 

3122
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:23,383
WITHIN 24 HOURS? 

3123
01:40:23,383 --> 01:40:24,351
>> SENATOR, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 

3124
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:25,285
MYANMAR IS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. 

3125
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:27,454
>> WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT. 

3126
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:30,424
BUT, YOU AND INVESTIGATORS HAVE 

3127
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:35,762
BLAMED FACEBOOK FOR PLAYING A 

3128
01:40:35,762 --> 01:40:36,530
ROLE IN THAT GENOCIDE. 

3129
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:37,664
WE ALL AGREE IT'S TERRIBLE. 

3130
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:46,039
HOW CAN YOU DEDICATE, AND WILL 

3131
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:47,007
YOU DEDICATE THE RESOURCES THAT 

3132
01:40:47,007 --> 01:40:48,242
MAKES SURE SUCH HATE SPEECH IS 

3133
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:54,148
TAKEN DOWN WITHIN 24 HOURS? 

3134
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:55,449
>> YES, WE ARE WORKING ON THIS. 

3135
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:56,383
THERE ARE THREE SPECIFIC THINGS 

3136
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:57,217
WE ARE DOING. 

3137
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:58,085
ONE IS, WE ARE HIRING DOZENS 

3138
01:40:58,085 --> 01:40:59,352
MORE BURMESE LANGUAGE CONTENT 

3139
01:40:59,352 --> 01:41:05,592
REVIEWERS. 

3140
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:06,527
BECAUSE, HATE SPEECH IS VERY 

3141
01:41:06,527 --> 01:41:06,960
LANGUAGE SPECIFIC. 

3142
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,028
IT'S HARD TO DO IT WITHOUT 

3143
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:08,962
PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THE LOCAL 

3144
01:41:08,962 --> 01:41:10,264
LANGUAGE AND WE NEED TO RAMP UP 

3145
01:41:10,264 --> 01:41:11,031
OUR EFFORT THERE VERY 

3146
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:11,598
DRAMATICALLY. 

3147
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:12,699
SECOND IS, WE ARE WORKING WITH 

3148
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:13,667
CIVIL SOCIETY IN MYANMAR TO 

3149
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:14,401
IDENTIFY SPECIFIC HATE FIGURES, 

3150
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:15,536
SO WE CAN TAKE DOWN THEIR 

3151
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:16,270
ACCOUNTS, RATHER THAN SPECIFIC 

3152
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,170
PIECES OF CONTENT. 

3153
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,905
THIRD IS, WE ARE STANDING UP A 

3154
01:41:18,905 --> 01:41:21,908
PRODUCT TEAM TO DO SPECIFIC 

3155
01:41:21,908 --> 01:41:23,410
PRODUCT CHANGES IN MYANMAR AND 

3156
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:26,413
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MAY HAVE 

3157
01:41:26,413 --> 01:41:27,347
SIMILAR ISSUES IN THE FUTURE, 

3158
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:28,281
TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. 

3159
01:41:28,281 --> 01:41:33,153
>> WHEN SENATOR CRUZ AND I SENT 

3160
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:36,523
A LETTER TO APPLE,  ASKING WHAT 

3161
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:38,225
THEY ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT 

3162
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:45,332
CHINESE CENSORSHIP, -- MY 

3163
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:46,466
QUESTION, I WILL PLACE FOR THE 

3164
01:41:46,466 --> 01:41:46,699
RECORD. 

3165
01:41:46,699 --> 01:41:48,702
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WILL DO 

3166
01:41:48,702 --> 01:41:50,170
ABOUT CHINESE CENSORSHIP WHEN 

3167
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:50,938
THEY COME TO YOU. 

3168
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,039
>> SENATOR GRAHAM IS UP NEXT. 

3169
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:52,606
>> THANK YOU. 

3170
01:41:52,606 --> 01:42:05,586
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANDREW 

3171
01:42:05,586 --> 01:42:05,853
BOSWORTH? 

3172
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:06,720
>> YES, SENATOR, I AM. 

3173
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,122
>> HE SAYS, WE CONNECT MORE 

3174
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:08,789
PEOPLE, MAYBE SOMEBODY DIES IN 

3175
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:18,331
A TERRORIST ATTACK  COORDINATED 

3176
01:42:18,331 --> 01:42:18,899
ON OUR RULES. 

3177
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:20,200
THE OF THE TRUTH IS THAT WE 

3178
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,134
BELIEVE IN CONNECTING PEOPLE SO 

3179
01:42:21,134 --> 01:42:21,902
DEEPLY, THAT ANYTHING THAT 

3180
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:22,836
ALLOWS US TO CONNECT PEOPLE 

3181
01:42:22,836 --> 01:42:23,937
MORE OFTEN IS DE FACTO GOOD. 

3182
01:42:23,937 --> 01:42:24,871
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 

3183
01:42:24,871 --> 01:42:26,006
>> NO, SENATOR, I DO NOT. 

3184
01:42:26,006 --> 01:42:32,212
AND, IN CONTEXT, BOS WROTE THAT 

3185
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:33,513
-- BOS IS WHAT WE CALL HIM 

3186
01:42:33,513 --> 01:42:33,813
INTERNALLY. 

3187
01:42:33,813 --> 01:42:34,648
HE WROTE THAT INTERNAL NOTE, 

3188
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:35,982
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSION 

3189
01:42:35,982 --> 01:42:36,349
INTERNALLY.  

3190
01:42:36,349 --> 01:42:37,451
I DISAGREED WITH THAT AT THE 

3191
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:48,328
TIME THAT HE WROTE IT. 

3192
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:49,462
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE COMMENTS, 

3193
01:42:49,462 --> 01:42:50,597
<u> LOT OF PEOPLE INTERNALLY DID, </u>

3194
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:50,797
TOO. 

3195
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:52,266
>> DO YOU SAY THAT YOU DID A 

3196
01:42:52,266 --> 01:42:53,433
POOR JOB AS A CEO COMMUNICATING 

3197
01:42:53,433 --> 01:42:54,134
YOUR DISPLEASUE WITH SUCH 

3198
01:42:54,134 --> 01:42:54,401
THOUGHTS? 

3199
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:55,268
BECAUSE IF HE HAD UNDERSTOOD 

3200
01:42:55,268 --> 01:42:56,403
WHERE YOU'RE AT, HE WOULD HAVE 

3201
01:42:56,403 --> 01:43:04,077
NEVER SAID IT TO BEGIN WITH. 

3202
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:05,412
>> WELL SENATOR, WE TRY TO RUN 

3203
01:43:05,412 --> 01:43:06,513
OUR COMPANY IN A WAY WHERE 

3204
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:07,280
PEOPLE CAN EXPRESS DIFFERENT 

3205
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:07,747
OPINIONS INTERNALLY. 

3206
01:43:07,747 --> 01:43:08,748
>> WELL, THIS IS AN OPINION 

3207
01:43:08,748 --> 01:43:09,883
úTH 

3208
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:11,018
AND IF SOMEBODY SAID THIS, I'D 

3209
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:11,385
FIRE THEM. 

3210
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:12,352
WHO IS YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITOR? 

3211
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:13,654
>> SENATOR, WE HAVE A LOT OF 

3212
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:13,987
COMPETITORS. 

3213
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:16,089
>> WHO IS YOUR BIGGEST? 

3214
01:43:16,089 --> 01:43:17,224
>> DID YOU WANT JUST ONE? 

3215
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:18,992
I'M NOT SURE I COULD GIVE JUST 

3216
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:23,764
ONE. 

3217
01:43:23,764 --> 01:43:24,898
BUT, I COULD GIVE A BUNCH. 

3218
01:43:24,898 --> 01:43:25,832
THERE ARE THREE CATEGORIES I 

3219
01:43:25,832 --> 01:43:26,400
COULD FOCUS ON. 

3220
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,334
ONE ARE THE OTHER TECH 

3221
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:30,871
PLATFORMS, GOOGLE, APPLE, 

3222
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:31,304
AMAZON, MICROSOFT. 

3223
01:43:31,304 --> 01:43:32,539
WE OVERLAP WITH THEM IN A LOT 

3224
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:33,106
OF DIFFERENT WAYS. 

3225
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:34,274
>> DO THEY PROVIDE THE SAME 

3226
01:43:34,274 --> 01:43:34,908
SERVICE YOU PROVIDE? 

3227
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:43,650
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. 

3228
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,319
IF I BUY A FORD AND IT DOES NOT 

3229
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:46,653
WORK WELL AND I DON'T LIKE IT, 

3230
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:47,587
I CAN BUY A CHEVY. 

3231
01:43:47,587 --> 01:43:48,522
IF I'M UPSET WITH FACEBOOK, 

3232
01:43:48,522 --> 01:43:49,456
WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT PRODUCT 

3233
01:43:49,456 --> 01:44:02,969
THAT I CAN GO AND SIGN UP FOR?  

3234
01:44:02,969 --> 01:44:04,071
>> THE SECOND CATEGORY I WAS 

3235
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,172
GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS -- 

3236
01:44:05,172 --> 01:44:06,106
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT 

3237
01:44:06,106 --> 01:44:06,406
CATEGORIES. 

3238
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:07,240
I'M TALKING ABOUT, IS THERE 

3239
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,208
REAL COMPETITION THAT YOU FACE? 

3240
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:09,343
CAR COMPANIES FACE A LOT OF 

3241
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:09,676
COMPETITIONS. 

3242
01:44:09,676 --> 01:44:10,644
IF THEY MAKE A DEFECTIVE CAR, 

3243
01:44:10,644 --> 01:44:11,411
PEOPLE START BUYING ANOTHER 

3244
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:11,611
ONE. 

3245
01:44:11,611 --> 01:44:12,512
IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE TO 

3246
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:13,446
FACEBOOK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR? 

3247
01:44:13,446 --> 01:44:13,847
>> YES. 

3248
01:44:13,847 --> 01:44:14,781
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN USES EIGHT 

3249
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:15,549
DIFFERENT APPS TO COMMUNICATE 

3250
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:16,650
WITH FRIENDS AND STAY IN TOUCH 

3251
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:17,584
WITH PEOPLE, RANGING FROM TEXT 

3252
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:18,151
APPS AND EMAIL. 

3253
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:19,286
>> WHICH IS THE SAME SERVICE 

3254
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:19,653
YOU PROVIDE? 

3255
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:20,787
>> WE PROVIDE A NUMBER OF 

3256
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:21,220
DIFFERENT SERVICES. 

3257
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,456
>> IS TWITTER THE SAME AS WHAT 

3258
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:22,823
YOU DO? 

3259
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:23,956
>> IT OVERLAPS. 

3260
01:44:23,956 --> 01:44:27,694
>> YOU DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A 

3261
01:44:27,694 --> 01:44:27,961
MONOPOLY? 

3262
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:28,829
>> IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T FEEL 

3263
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:33,133
THAT WAY TO ME. 

3264
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:33,733
>> IT DOESN'T. 

3265
01:44:33,733 --> 01:44:34,468
SO, INSTAGRAM, YOU BOUGHT 

3266
01:44:34,468 --> 01:44:34,768
INSTAGRAM. 

3267
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:39,106
WHY DID YOU BUY INSTAGRAM? 

3268
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,040
>> BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY 

3269
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,807
TALENTED APP DEVELOPERS MAKING 

3270
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:41,942
GOOD USE OF OUR PLATFORM AND 

3271
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:42,509
UNDERSTOOD OUR VALUES. 

3272
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:46,446
>> A GOOD BUSINESS DECISION. 

3273
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:47,781
MY POINT IS THAT, ONE WAY TO 

3274
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:48,715
REGULATE A COMPANY IS THROUGH 

3275
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:49,849
COMPETITION, THROUGH GOVERNMENT 

3276
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:50,784
REGULATION. 

3277
01:44:50,784 --> 01:44:52,351
HERE'S THE QUESTION THAT ALL OF 

3278
01:44:52,351 --> 01:45:02,596
US GOT AN ANSWER. 

3279
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:03,330
WHAT DO WE TELL OUR 

3280
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,097
CONSTITUENTS, GIVEN WHAT HAS 

3281
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:05,198
HAPPENED, WHY WE SHOULD LET YOU 

3282
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:05,598
SELF REGULATE? 

3283
01:45:05,598 --> 01:45:08,302
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE IN 

3284
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:09,336
SOUTH CAROLINA, GIVEN ALL OF 

3285
01:45:09,336 --> 01:45:10,236
THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED 

3286
01:45:10,236 --> 01:45:11,538
HERE, IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR US 

3287
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:12,672
TO RELY UPON YOU TO REGULATE 

3288
01:45:12,672 --> 01:45:14,941
YOUR OWN BUSINESS PRACTICES? 

3289
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:16,076
>> WELL SENATOR, MY POSITION IS 

3290
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:17,677
NOT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO 

3291
01:45:17,677 --> 01:45:22,849
REGULATION. 

3292
01:45:22,849 --> 01:45:23,216
>> OKAY. 

3293
01:45:23,216 --> 01:45:23,983
DO YOU EMBRACE REGULATION? 

3294
01:45:23,983 --> 01:45:25,285
>> I THINK THE REAL QUESTION AS 

3295
01:45:25,285 --> 01:45:26,019
THE INTERNET BECOMES MORE 

3296
01:45:26,019 --> 01:45:36,329
IMPORTANT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES IS, 

3297
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:37,297
WHAT IS THE RIGHT REGULATION? 

3298
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:38,598
>> BUT DO YOU, AS A COMPANY, 

3299
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:39,032
WELCOME REGULATION? 

3300
01:45:39,032 --> 01:45:40,267
>> I THINK IF IT'S THE RIGHT 

3301
01:45:40,267 --> 01:45:40,834
REGULATION, THEN YES. 

3302
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:41,968
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THE 

3303
01:45:41,968 --> 01:45:42,702
EUROPEANS HAVE IT RIGHT? 

3304
01:45:42,702 --> 01:45:44,004
>> I THINK THAT THEY GET THINGS 

3305
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:44,237
RIGHT. 

3306
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:50,210
>> THAT'S TRUE. 

3307
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,545
SO, WOULD YOU WORK WITH US IN 

3308
01:45:51,545 --> 01:45:52,479
TERMS OF WHAT REGULATIONS YOU 

3309
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:53,413
THINK ARE NECESSARY IN YOUR 

3310
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:53,680
INDUSTRY? 

3311
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,047
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

3312
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:54,347
>> OKAY. 

3313
01:45:54,347 --> 01:45:55,582
WOULD YOU SUBMIT TO US SOME 

3314
01:45:55,582 --> 01:45:56,082
PROPOSED REGULATIONS? 

3315
01:45:56,082 --> 01:45:56,349
>> YES. 

3316
01:45:56,349 --> 01:45:57,516
AND I WILL HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW 

3317
01:45:57,516 --> 01:45:58,818
UP WITH YOU SO WE CAN DISCUSS 

3318
01:45:58,818 --> 01:46:00,119
ú 

3319
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:05,125
CATEGORIES. 

3320
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:05,959
>> LOOK FORWARD TO IT. 

3321
01:46:05,959 --> 01:46:07,093
WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK, 

3322
01:46:07,093 --> 01:46:08,228
YOU SIGN UP FOR TERMS OF 

3323
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:08,495
SERVICE. 

3324
01:46:08,495 --> 01:46:09,329
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT? 

3325
01:46:09,329 --> 01:46:09,696
>> YES. 

3326
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:10,664
>> OKAY. 

3327
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:14,601
IT SAYS, THE TERMS GOVERNING 

3328
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:15,702
THE USE OF FACEBOOK AND ITS 

3329
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:16,269
PRODUCTS, FEATURES, APPS, 

3330
01:46:16,269 --> 01:46:16,903
SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY, SOFTWARE 

3331
01:46:16,903 --> 01:46:17,737
WE OFFER, FACEBOOK PRODUCT OR 

3332
01:46:17,737 --> 01:46:20,373
PRODUCTS, EXCEPT WHERE WE 

3333
01:46:20,373 --> 01:46:21,340
EXPRESSLY STATE THAT SEPARATE 

3334
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:22,074
TERMS AND THESE APPLY. 

3335
01:46:22,074 --> 01:46:23,410
I'M A LAWYER AND HAVE NO IDEA 

3336
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:24,044
WHAT THAT MEANS. 

3337
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:25,278
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT TERMS OF 

3338
01:46:25,278 --> 01:46:28,648
SERVICE, THIS IS WHAT YOU GET. 

3339
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:29,583
DO YOU THINK THE AVERAGE 

3340
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:30,550
CONSUMER UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY 

3341
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:38,592
ARE SIGNING UP FOR? 

3342
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:39,726
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THE 

3343
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:40,660
AVERAGE PERSON LIKELY READ THAT 

3344
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:41,027
WHOLE DOCUMENT. 

3345
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:42,162
BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE 

3346
01:46:42,162 --> 01:46:43,096
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN 

3347
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:44,030
COMMUNICATE THAT AND HAVE A 

3348
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:44,764
RESPONSE TO DO SO. 

3349
01:46:44,764 --> 01:46:46,099
>> DO YOU AGREE THAT WE'VE GOT 

3350
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:47,200
TO COME UP WITH OTHER WAYS 

3351
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:51,872
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T WORKING? 

3352
01:46:51,872 --> 01:46:52,973
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK IN 

3353
01:46:52,973 --> 01:46:53,940
CERTAIN AREAS THAT IS TRUE. 

3354
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,074
AND I THINK IN OTHER AREAS, 

3355
01:46:55,074 --> 01:46:56,842
LIKE THE CORE PART OF WHAT WE 

3356
01:46:56,842 --> 01:47:01,081
DO, IF YOU ARE THINKING AT THE 

3357
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:02,015
MOST BASIC LEVEL, PEOPLE COME 

3358
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:02,582
TO FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, 

3359
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:03,316
WHATSAPP, MESSENGER ABOUT 100 

3360
01:47:03,316 --> 01:47:10,657
BILLION TIMES A DAY  TO SHARE A 

3361
01:47:10,657 --> 01:47:11,791
PIECE OF CONTENT OR A MESSAGE 

3362
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:12,893
WITH A SPECIFIC SET OF PEOPLE. 

3363
01:47:12,893 --> 01:47:14,027
AND I THINK THAT THAT BASIC 

3364
01:47:14,027 --> 01:47:14,494
FUNCTIONALITY PEOPLE 

3365
01:47:14,494 --> 01:47:15,328
UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE 

3366
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,296
CONTROLS IN LINE EVERY TIME. 

3367
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:17,397
AND, GIVEN THE VOLUME OF THE 

3368
01:47:17,397 --> 01:47:18,331
ACTIVITY AND THE VALUE THE 

3369
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:20,033
PEOPLE TELL US THEY ARE GETTING 

3370
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:23,036
FROM THAT, I THINK THAT THAT 

3371
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:24,104
CONTROL IN-LINE DOES SEEM TO BE 

3372
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:24,671
WORKING FAIRLY WELL. 

3373
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:28,275
NOW, WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER. 

3374
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,209
AND THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES 

3375
01:47:29,209 --> 01:47:30,343
THAT ARE COMPLEX AND THERE IS 

3376
01:47:30,343 --> 01:47:31,645
MORE TO IT THAN JUST, YOU KNOW, 

3377
01:47:31,645 --> 01:47:37,284
YOU GO AND POST A PHOTO. 

3378
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:38,585
SO I AGREE THE PLACES NEED TO 

3379
01:47:38,585 --> 01:47:38,952
DO BETTER. 

3380
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:40,286
AS FOR THE CORE OF THE SERVICE, 

3381
01:47:40,286 --> 01:47:41,221
IT ACTUALLY IS QUITE CLEAR. 

3382
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:42,889
>> THANK YOU. 

3383
01:47:42,889 --> 01:47:47,427
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR? 

3384
01:47:47,427 --> 01:47:48,694
>> I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREED 

3385
01:47:48,694 --> 01:47:56,937
THIS WAS A BREACH OF TRUST.  

3386
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:58,238
THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THIS IS IF 

3387
01:47:58,238 --> 01:47:58,972
SOMEONE BREAKS INTO MY 

3388
01:47:58,972 --> 01:47:59,940
APARTMENT WITH A CROWBAR AND 

3389
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,074
THEY TAKE MY STUFF, IT'S JUST 

3390
01:48:01,074 --> 01:48:02,208
LIKE IF THE MANAGER GAVE THEM 

3391
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:03,510
THE KEYS OR IF THEY DID NOT 

3392
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:04,844
HAVE ANY LOCKS ON THE DOORS, IT 

3393
01:48:04,844 --> 01:48:05,579
IS STILL A BREACH. 

3394
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:06,713
IT IS STILL A BREAK IN. 

3395
01:48:06,713 --> 01:48:08,014
I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE LAWS 

3396
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:08,782
AND RULES THAT ARE 

3397
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:09,516
SOPHISTICATED, AS THE BRILLIANT 

3398
01:48:09,516 --> 01:48:10,850
PRODUCTS THAT YOU HAVE 

3399
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:12,719
DEVELOPED HERE. 

3400
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:13,920
AND WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE THAT 

3401
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,120
YET. 

3402
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:15,322
AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I 

3403
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:16,889
THINK WE FOCUSED ON IS THE 

3404
01:48:16,889 --> 01:48:18,692
ELECTION. 

3405
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:19,659
AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT 

3406
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:20,760
THAT YOU AND FACEBOOK, AND NOW 

3407
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,161
TWITTER, HAVE GIVEN TO THE 

3408
01:48:22,161 --> 01:48:25,632
HONEST ADS ACT BILL, THAT I'M 

3409
01:48:25,632 --> 01:48:26,600
LEADING WITH SENATOR McCAIN AND 

3410
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:39,913
SENATOR WARNER.  

3411
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:41,481
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, AS WE WORK 

3412
01:48:41,481 --> 01:48:42,716
TO PASS THIS LAW, SO THAT WE 

3413
01:48:42,716 --> 01:48:44,017
HAVE THE SAME RULES IN PLACE TO 

3414
01:48:44,017 --> 01:48:44,784
DISCLOSE POLITICAL ADS AND 

3415
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:46,286
ISSUE ADS AS WE DO FOR TV AND 

3416
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:47,253
RADIO, AS WELL AS DISCLAIMERS, 

3417
01:48:47,253 --> 01:48:48,521
THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE EARLY 

3418
01:48:48,521 --> 01:48:51,324
ACTION AS SOON AS JUNE,  BEFORE 

3419
01:48:51,324 --> 01:48:52,258
THIS ELECTION, SO THAT PEOPLE 

3420
01:48:52,258 --> 01:48:53,226
CAN VIEW THESE ADS, INCLUDING 

3421
01:48:53,226 --> 01:48:54,160
ISSUE ADS, IS THAT CORRECT? 

3422
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,562
>> THAT IS CORRECT AND I WANT 

3423
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:56,763
TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK YOU 

3424
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:57,897
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP  ON THIS. 

3425
01:48:57,897 --> 01:48:59,032
THIS, I THINK, IS AN IMPORTANT 

3426
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:00,166
AREA FOR THE WHOLE INDUSTRY TO 

3427
01:49:00,166 --> 01:49:00,533
MOVE ON. 

3428
01:49:00,533 --> 01:49:01,668
THE TWO SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE 

3429
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:04,970
ARE DOING OUR, ONE IS AROUND 

3430
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:05,304
TRANSPARENCY. 

3431
01:49:05,304 --> 01:49:06,506
SO, NOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE 

3432
01:49:06,506 --> 01:49:10,477
ABLE TO GO AND CLICK ON ANY 

3433
01:49:10,477 --> 01:49:11,411
ADVERTISER OR ANY PAGE ON 

3434
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:12,712
FACEBOOK AND SEE ALL OF THE ADS 

3435
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:21,888
THAT THEY ARE RUNNING.  

3436
01:49:21,888 --> 01:49:22,455
THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS 

3437
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:23,023
ADVERTISING ONLINE, ON 

3438
01:49:23,023 --> 01:49:23,957
FACEBOOK, TO AN EVEN HIGHER 

3439
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:24,891
STANDARD THAN WHAT YOU WOULD 

3440
01:49:24,891 --> 01:49:26,026
HAVE ON TV OR PRINT MEDIA. 

3441
01:49:26,026 --> 01:49:26,960
BECAUSE THERE IS NOWHERE THAT 

3442
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,662
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE TV ADS , 

3443
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:29,029
FOR EXAMPLE. 

3444
01:49:29,029 --> 01:49:30,330
WHERE AS YOU WILL NOW BE ABLE 

3445
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:31,464
TO SEE ON FACEBOOK WHETHER THIS 

3446
01:49:31,464 --> 01:49:34,634
CAMPAIGN OR THIRD PARTY IS 

3447
01:49:34,634 --> 01:49:35,402
SAYING DIFFERENT MESSAGES TO 

3448
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:36,135
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE. 

3449
01:49:36,135 --> 01:49:37,070
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT 

3450
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:40,607
ELEMENT OF TRANSPARENCY. 

3451
01:49:40,607 --> 01:49:41,574
THE OTHER IMPORTANT PIECE IS 

3452
01:49:41,574 --> 01:49:42,342
AROUND VERIFYING EVERY SINGLE 

3453
01:49:42,342 --> 01:49:43,443
ADVERTISER WHO IS GOING TO BE 

3454
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:48,148
RUNNING POLITICAL OR ISSUE ADS. 

3455
01:49:48,148 --> 01:49:48,915
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

3456
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:50,050
AND, SENATOR WARREN AND I HAVE 

3457
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:51,217
CALLED ON GOOGLE AND OTHER 

3458
01:49:51,217 --> 01:49:58,658
PLATFORMS TO DO THE SAME.  

3459
01:49:58,658 --> 01:50:00,160
SO A MEMO TO THE REST OF YOU, 

3460
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,661
WE HAVE TO GET THIS DONE OR WE 

3461
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:02,761
ARE GOING TO HAVE A PATCHWORK 

3462
01:50:02,761 --> 01:50:03,129
OF ADS. 

3463
01:50:03,129 --> 01:50:04,464
I HOPE YOU WILL BE WORKING WITH 

3464
01:50:04,464 --> 01:50:05,398
US TO PASS THIS BILL. 

3465
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:05,965
IS THAT RIGHT? 

3466
01:50:05,965 --> 01:50:06,700
>> WE WILL.  

3467
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,100
>> OKAY. 

3468
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:08,200
NOW ON THE SUBJECT OF CAMBRIDGE 

3469
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:08,968
ANALYTICA, WERE THESE PEOPLE, 

3470
01:50:08,968 --> 01:50:10,804
THE 87 MILLION PEOPLE, USERS, 

3471
01:50:10,804 --> 01:50:11,538
CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN STATES? 

3472
01:50:11,538 --> 01:50:12,672
ARE YOU ABLE TO FIGURE OUT 

3473
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:14,774
WHERE THEY ARE FROM? 

3474
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:15,909
>> I DO NOT HAVE THAT 

3475
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:23,383
INFORMATION WITH ME. 

3476
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:24,718
BUT, WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR 

3477
01:50:24,718 --> 01:50:24,951
OFFICE. 

3478
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:25,285
>> OKAY. 

3479
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:26,219
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, THE 

3480
01:50:26,219 --> 01:50:27,153
ELECTION WAS CLOSE, AND THERE 

3481
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:28,855
WAS ONLY THOUSANDS OF VOTES IN 

3482
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:29,222
CERTAIN STATES. 

3483
01:50:29,222 --> 01:50:30,156
YOU ALSO ESTIMATED THAT ROUGHLY 

3484
01:50:30,156 --> 01:50:32,959
126 MILLION PEOPLE MAY HAVE 

3485
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:33,893
BEEN SHOWN CONTENT FROM A 

3486
01:50:33,893 --> 01:50:34,661
FACEBOOK PAGE ASSOCIATED WITH 

3487
01:50:34,661 --> 01:50:36,529
THE INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY. 

3488
01:50:36,529 --> 01:50:37,464
HAVE YOU DETERMINED WHETHER ANY 

3489
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:40,834
OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE THE SAME 

3490
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:41,768
FACEBOOK USERS WHOSE DATA WAS 

3491
01:50:41,768 --> 01:50:46,306
SHARED WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA?

3492
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:47,540
ARE YOU ABLE TO MAKE THAT 

3493
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:47,940
DETERMINATION? 

3494
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:48,541
>> SENATOR, WE ARE 

3495
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:53,213
INVESTIGATING THAT NOW. 

3496
01:50:53,213 --> 01:50:54,147
WE BELIEVE IT IS ENTIRELY 

3497
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:55,281
POSSIBLE THAT THERE WILL BE A 

3498
01:50:55,281 --> 01:50:55,714
CONNECTION THERE. 

3499
01:50:55,714 --> 01:50:56,950
>> OKAY, THAT SEEMS LIKE A BIG 

3500
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:58,651
DEAL AS WE LOOK BACK AT THE 

3501
01:50:58,651 --> 01:50:59,018
LAST ELECTION. 

3502
01:50:59,018 --> 01:50:59,585
FORMER CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

3503
01:50:59,585 --> 01:51:02,222
EMPLOYEE CHRISTOPHER WILEY HAS 

3504
01:51:02,222 --> 01:51:09,896
SAID THAT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

3505
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:10,663
IMPROPERLY OBTAINED DATA FROM 

3506
01:51:10,663 --> 01:51:11,598
FACEBOOK USERS THAT COULD BE 

3507
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:12,131
STORED IN RUSSIA. 

3508
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:13,866
DO YOU AGREE THAT THAT IS A 

3509
01:51:13,866 --> 01:51:14,768
POSSIBILITY? 

3510
01:51:14,768 --> 01:51:15,902
>> SORRY, ARE YOU ASKING IF 

3511
01:51:15,902 --> 01:51:21,908
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA'S DATA 

3512
01:51:21,908 --> 01:51:22,842
COULD BE STORED IN RUSSIA? 

3513
01:51:22,842 --> 01:51:23,977
>> THAT'S WHAT HE SAID THIS 

3514
01:51:23,977 --> 01:51:25,478
WEEKEND ON A SUNDAY SHOW. 

3515
01:51:25,478 --> 01:51:31,084
>> SENATOR, I DON'T HAVE ANY 

3516
01:51:31,084 --> 01:51:31,851
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD 

3517
01:51:31,851 --> 01:51:32,218
SUGGEST THAT. 

3518
01:51:32,218 --> 01:51:33,520
BUT ONE OF THE STEPS THAT WE 

3519
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,021
NEED TO TAKE NOW IS GO TO A 

3520
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:36,689
FULL AUDIT OF ALL OF CAMBRIDGE 

3521
01:51:36,689 --> 01:51:40,260
ANALYTICA'S SYSTEMS TO 

3522
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:41,193
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE DOING, 

3523
01:51:41,193 --> 01:51:42,128
WHETHER THEY STILL HAVE ANY 

3524
01:51:42,128 --> 01:51:43,262
DATA, TO MAKE SURE THEY REMOVE 

3525
01:51:43,262 --> 01:51:44,597
THE DATA AND IF THEY DON'T, WE 

3526
01:51:44,597 --> 01:51:45,698
ARE GOING TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION 

3527
01:51:45,698 --> 01:51:46,633
AGAINST THEM TO DO SO. 

3528
01:51:46,633 --> 01:51:48,634
THAT AUDIT, WE HAVE TEMPORARILY 

3529
01:51:48,634 --> 01:51:49,469
 

3530
01:51:49,469 --> 01:51:50,570
UK GOVERNMENT COMPLETE THEIR 

3531
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:51,137
INVESTIGATION FIRST BECAUSE 

3532
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:52,038
THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER A 

3533
01:51:52,038 --> 01:51:57,710
COMPANY DOING THAT. 

3534
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:58,645
BUT, WE ARE COMMITTED TO 

3535
01:51:58,645 --> 01:51:59,579
COMPLETING THIS FULL AUDIT AND 

3536
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:00,713
GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT'S 

3537
01:52:00,713 --> 01:52:02,015
GOING ON HERE SO THAT WAY WE 

3538
01:52:02,015 --> 01:52:03,516
CAN HAVE MORE ANSWERS TO THIS. 

3539
01:52:03,516 --> 01:52:04,484
>> OKAY, EARLIER YOU STATED 

3540
01:52:04,484 --> 01:52:05,385
PUBLICLY AND HEAR THAT YOU 

3541
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:06,652
WOULD SUPPORT SOME PRIVACY 

3542
01:52:06,652 --> 01:52:08,021
RULES, SO THAT EVERYONE IS 

3543
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:10,657
PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES HERE. 

3544
01:52:10,657 --> 01:52:11,758
AND YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU 

3545
01:52:11,758 --> 01:52:13,058
SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS 

3546
01:52:13,058 --> 01:52:17,230
EARLIER. 

3547
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,331
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A RULE THAT 

3548
01:52:18,331 --> 01:52:19,264
WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO NOTIFY 

3549
01:52:19,264 --> 01:52:20,400
YOUR USERS OF A BREACH WITHIN 

3550
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,334
72 HOURS? 

3551
01:52:21,334 --> 01:52:26,739
>> SENATOR, THAT MAKES SENSE TO 

3552
01:52:26,739 --> 01:52:26,939
ME. 

3553
01:52:26,939 --> 01:52:28,074
AND, I THINK THAT WE SHOULD 

3554
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:29,209
HAVE OUR TEAM PULL UP WITH 

3555
01:52:29,209 --> 01:52:30,143
YOURS, TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS 

3556
01:52:30,143 --> 01:52:30,710
AROUND THAT MORE. 

3557
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:35,381
>> THANK YOU. 

3558
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:36,716
I JUST SING PART OF THIS WAS 

3559
01:52:36,716 --> 01:52:37,650
THAT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T EVEN 

3560
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:39,252
KNOW THAT THEIR DATA HAS BEEN 

3561
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:41,588
BREACHED, THAT IS A HUGE 

3562
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:41,855
PROBLEM. 

3563
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:43,089
AND I THINK THAT WE GET TO 

3564
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:44,023
SOLUTIONS FASTER WHEN THERE IS 

3565
01:52:44,023 --> 01:52:45,558
A HUGE PROBLEM OUT THERE. 

3566
01:52:45,558 --> 01:52:48,328
THANK YOU. 

3567
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:49,662
WE WOULD LOVE TO PASS THIS BILL 

3568
01:52:49,662 --> 01:52:50,597
BEFORE THE HONEST ELECTION ON 

3569
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:51,698
THE ADS, AND LOOKING FORWARD TO 

3570
01:52:51,698 --> 01:52:57,303
BETTER DISCLOSURE OF THIS 

3571
01:52:57,303 --> 01:52:57,603
ELECTION. 

3572
01:52:57,603 --> 01:52:58,605
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, NICE TO SEE 

3573
01:52:58,605 --> 01:52:58,805
YOU. 

3574
01:52:58,805 --> 01:53:00,707
WHEN I SAW YOU NOT TOO LONG 

3575
01:53:00,707 --> 01:53:07,080
AFTER  I ENTERED THE SENATE IN 

3576
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,581
2011, I TOLD YOU WHEN I SENT MY 

3577
01:53:08,581 --> 01:53:09,515
BUSINESS CARDS DOWN TO BE 

3578
01:53:09,515 --> 01:53:10,450
PRINTED, THEY CAME BACK FROM 

3579
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:12,719
THE SENATE PRINT SHOP WITH A 

3580
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:13,653
MESSAGE, THAT WAS THE FIRST 

3581
01:53:13,653 --> 01:53:14,587
BUSINESS CARD THEY HAD EVER 

3582
01:53:14,587 --> 01:53:17,957
PRINTED A FACEBOOK ADDRESS ON, 

3583
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:19,092
THERE ARE DAYS WHEN I HAVE 

3584
01:53:19,092 --> 01:53:20,026
REGRETTED THAT, BUT MORE DAYS 

3585
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:23,396
WHEN WE GET LOTS OF INFORMATION

3586
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:24,898
, WE NEED TO GET, I WONDER IF 

3587
01:53:24,898 --> 01:53:26,399
THE FACEBOOK FRIENDS IS A 

3588
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:26,966
LITTLE MISSTATED. 

3589
01:53:26,966 --> 01:53:28,101
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE I HAVE 

3590
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:35,041
THOSE EVERY SINGLE DAY. 

3591
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:36,142
BUT YOU KNOW, THE PLATFORM YOU 

3592
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:36,910
HAVE CREATED IS REALLY 

3593
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:37,210
IMPORTANT. 

3594
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:40,280
MY SON, CHARLIE, WHO IS 13, IS 

3595
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:40,847
DEDICATED TO INSTAGRAM. 

3596
01:53:40,847 --> 01:53:42,348
HE WOULD WANT TO BE SURE THAT I 

3597
01:53:42,348 --> 01:53:44,017
MENTIONED HIM WHILE I WAS HERE 

3598
01:53:44,017 --> 01:53:47,787
WITH YOU. 

3599
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:48,888
I HAVEN'T PRINTED THAT ON MY 

3600
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:49,455
CARD WITH YOU. 

3601
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:50,390
BUT I WILL SAY THAT. 

3602
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:51,724
I THINK WE HAVE THAT ACCOUNT AS 

3603
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:51,924
WELL. 

3604
01:53:51,924 --> 01:53:56,195
LOTS OF WAYS TO CONNECT PEOPLE. 

3605
01:53:56,195 --> 01:53:56,995
AND THE INFORMATION, OBVIOUSLY, 

3606
01:53:56,995 --> 01:53:57,730
IS AN IMPORTANT COMMODITY. 

3607
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:58,665
AND, IT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR 

3608
01:53:58,665 --> 01:53:59,032
BUSINESS WORK. 

3609
01:53:59,032 --> 01:54:06,873
I GET THAT. 

3610
01:54:06,873 --> 01:54:08,007
HOWEVER, I WONDER ABOUT SOME OF 

3611
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:08,607
THE COLLECTION EFFORTS. 

3612
01:54:08,607 --> 01:54:09,742
AND MAYBE WE CAN GO THROUGH 

3613
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:10,843
LARGELY EVEN JUST YES OR NO, 

3614
01:54:10,843 --> 01:54:11,978
AND THEN GET BACK TO MORE 

3615
01:54:11,978 --> 01:54:13,446
EXPANSIVE DISCUSSIONS OF THIS. 

3616
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:14,580
BUT, DO YOU COLLECT USER DATA 

3617
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:19,252
THROUGH CROSS DEVICE TRACKING? 

3618
01:54:19,252 --> 01:54:20,386
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE WE DO 

3619
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:21,654
LINK PEOPLE'S ACCOUNTS BETWEEN 

3620
01:54:21,654 --> 01:54:26,192
DEVICES, IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE 

3621
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:26,959
THAT THERE FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, 

3622
01:54:26,959 --> 01:54:33,933
AND OTHER EXPERIENCES CAN BE 

3623
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:34,466
SYNCED BETWEEN DEVICES. 

3624
01:54:34,466 --> 01:54:35,501
>> THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE OFF-

3625
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:35,802
LINE DATA? 

3626
01:54:35,802 --> 01:54:36,703
DATA TRACKING THAT IS NOT 

3627
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:41,474
NECESSARILY LINKED TO FACEBOOK, 

3628
01:54:41,474 --> 01:54:42,709
BUT LINKED TO SOME DEVICE THEY 

3629
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:43,443
WENT THROUGH FACEBOOK ON. 

3630
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:44,009
IS THAT RIGHT? 

3631
01:54:44,009 --> 01:54:45,345
>> SENATOR, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 

3632
01:54:45,345 --> 01:54:46,112
I GET THIS RIGHT. 

3633
01:54:46,112 --> 01:54:53,019
I WANT TO HAVE MY TEAM GET WITH 

3634
01:54:53,019 --> 01:54:53,419
YOU AFTERWARDS. 

3635
01:54:53,419 --> 01:54:54,320
>> THAT DOESN'T SEEM THAT 

3636
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:54,887
COMPLICATED TO ME. 

3637
01:54:54,887 --> 01:54:55,822
YOU UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER THAN 

3638
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:56,222
I DO. 

3639
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:57,557
MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY 

3640
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:58,123
THAT IS COMPLICATED. 

3641
01:54:58,123 --> 01:54:59,191
DO YOU TRACK DEVICES THAT AN 

3642
01:54:59,191 --> 01:55:00,526
INDIVIDUAL WHO USES FACEBOOK 

3643
01:55:00,526 --> 01:55:08,234
HAS, THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE 

3644
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:09,335
DEVICE THAT THEY USE FOR THEIR 

3645
01:55:09,335 --> 01:55:10,303
FACEBOOK CONNECTION, BUT NOT 

3646
01:55:10,303 --> 01:55:11,036
NECESSARILY CONNECTED TO 

3647
01:55:11,036 --> 01:55:13,239
FACEBOOK? 

3648
01:55:13,239 --> 01:55:14,540
>> I'M NOT SURE OF THE ANSWER 

3649
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,140
TO THAT QUESTION. 

3650
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:16,109
>> REALLY? 

3651
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:19,846
>> YES. 

3652
01:55:19,846 --> 01:55:21,147
THERE MAY BE SOME DATA THAT IS 

3653
01:55:21,147 --> 01:55:21,914
NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE 

3654
01:55:21,914 --> 01:55:23,082
SERVICE THAT WE DO. 

3655
01:55:23,082 --> 01:55:28,087
BUT, I DON'T HAVE THAT SITTING 

3656
01:55:28,087 --> 01:55:28,454
HERE TODAY. 

3657
01:55:28,454 --> 01:55:29,589
SO THAT IS SOMETHING I WOULD 

3658
01:55:29,589 --> 01:55:30,523
WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON. 

3659
01:55:30,523 --> 01:55:31,657
>> NOW, THE FTC LAST YEAR 

3660
01:55:31,657 --> 01:55:32,391
FLAGGED CROSS DEVICE TRACKING 

3661
01:55:32,391 --> 01:55:34,093
AS ONE OF THEIR CONCERNS. 

3662
01:55:34,093 --> 01:55:35,395
GENERALLY, THAT PEOPLE ARE 

3663
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:37,830
TRACKING DEVICES, THAT THE 

3664
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:40,366
USERS OF SOMETHING LIKE FACEBOOK

3665
01:55:40,366 --> 01:55:42,001
DON'T KNOW THAT ARE BEING 

3666
01:55:42,001 --> 01:55:42,268
TRACKED. 

3667
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:45,872
HOW DO YOU DISCLOSE YOUR 

3668
01:55:45,872 --> 01:55:52,078
COLLECTION METHODS? 

3669
01:55:52,078 --> 01:55:53,212
IS THAT ALL IN THIS DOCUMENT 

3670
01:55:53,212 --> 01:55:54,514
THAT I WOULD SEE AND AGREE TO 

3671
01:55:54,514 --> 01:56:03,523
BEFORE I ENTER INTO FACEBOOK? 

3672
01:56:03,523 --> 01:56:04,122
>> YES, SENATOR. 

3673
01:56:04,122 --> 01:56:05,391
THERE ARE TWO WAYS THAT WE DO 

3674
01:56:05,391 --> 01:56:05,591
THIS. 

3675
01:56:05,591 --> 01:56:06,959
ONE IS, WE TRY TO BE EXHAUSTIVE 

3676
01:56:06,959 --> 01:56:07,827
IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS AROUND 

3677
01:56:07,827 --> 01:56:08,795
THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND 

3678
01:56:08,795 --> 01:56:09,195
PRIVACY POLICIES. 

3679
01:56:09,195 --> 01:56:10,263
BUT MORE IMPORTANT, WE TRY TO 

3680
01:56:10,263 --> 01:56:14,400
PROVIDE IN-LINE CONTROLS, THAT 

3681
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,534
ARE IN PLAIN ENGLISH, SO THAT 

3682
01:56:15,534 --> 01:56:15,968
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. 

3683
01:56:15,968 --> 01:56:17,036
THEY CAN EITHER GO TO SETTINGS 

3684
01:56:17,036 --> 01:56:18,304
WHERE WE CAN SHOW THEM AT THE 

3685
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,573
TOP OF THE APP PERIODICALLY. 

3686
01:56:20,573 --> 01:56:21,474
SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ALL 

3687
01:56:21,474 --> 01:56:22,475
THE CONTROLS AND SETTINGS THAT 

3688
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:23,409
THEY HAVE, AND CAN CONFIGURE 

3689
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:24,911
THEIR EXPERIENCE THE WAY THAT 

3690
01:56:24,911 --> 01:56:29,949
THEY WANT. 

3691
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:31,284
>> SO, DO PEOPLE NOW GIVE YOU 

3692
01:56:31,284 --> 01:56:32,051
PERMISSION TO TRACK SPECIFIC 

3693
01:56:32,051 --> 01:56:32,819
DEVICES IN THEIR CONTRACT? 

3694
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:34,087
AND IF THEY DO, IS THAT A 

3695
01:56:34,087 --> 01:56:35,588
RELATIVELY NEW ADDITION TO WHAT 

3696
01:56:35,588 --> 01:56:43,096
YOU DO? 

3697
01:56:43,096 --> 01:56:44,396
OR AM I ABLE TO OPT OUT? 

3698
01:56:44,396 --> 01:56:45,898
AM I ABLE TO SAY, IT'S OKAY FOR 

3699
01:56:45,898 --> 01:56:47,666
YOU TO TRACK WHAT I'M SAYING ON 

3700
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,836
FACEBOOK, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU 

3701
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:50,970
TO TRACK WHAT I'M TEXTING TO 

3702
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:52,438
SOMEBODY ELSE OFF FACEBOOK, ON 

3703
01:56:52,438 --> 01:56:54,140
AN ANDROID? 

3704
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:54,674
>> OH, OKAY. 

3705
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:55,641
YES, SENATOR. 

3706
01:56:55,641 --> 01:56:58,644
IN GENERAL, FACEBOOK IS NOT 

3707
01:56:58,644 --> 01:56:59,579
COLLECTING DATA FROM OTHER APPS 

3708
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:04,650
THAT YOU USE. 

3709
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:05,584
THERE MAY BE SOME SPECIFIC 

3710
01:57:05,584 --> 01:57:06,519
THINGS ABOUT THE DEVICE THAT 

3711
01:57:06,519 --> 01:57:07,486
YOU ARE USING THAT FACEBOOK 

3712
01:57:07,486 --> 01:57:08,588
NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND IN ORDER TO 

3713
01:57:08,588 --> 01:57:09,889
OFFER THE SERVICE. 

3714
01:57:09,889 --> 01:57:11,023
BUT, IF YOU ARE USING GOOGLE, 

3715
01:57:11,023 --> 01:57:13,459
OR YOU ARE USING SOME TEXTING AT

3716
01:57:13,459 --> 01:57:16,529
, UNLESS YOU SPECIFICALLY OPT IN

3717
01:57:16,529 --> 01:57:17,763
THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE THE 

3718
01:57:17,763 --> 01:57:18,931
TEXTING APP INFORMATION, 

3719
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:21,901
FACEBOOK WOULDN'T SEE THAT. 

3720
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:26,739
>> HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY? 

3721
01:57:26,739 --> 01:57:28,040
OR IS THAT A RECENT ADDITION TO 

3722
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:31,477
HOW YOU DEAL WITH THOSE OTHER 

3723
01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:35,481
WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT COMMUNICATE?

3724
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:36,516
>> SENATOR, MY UNDERSTANDING IS 

3725
01:57:36,516 --> 01:57:37,650
THAT THAT IS HOW THE MOBILE 

3726
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,986
OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE ARCHITECT.

3727
01:57:39,986 --> 01:57:46,325
>> SO, YOU DON'T HAVE BUNDLED 

3728
01:57:46,325 --> 01:57:52,298
PERMISSIONS FOR HOW I CAN AGREE 

3729
01:57:52,298 --> 01:57:54,534
TO WHAT DEVICES I MAY USE, THAT 

3730
01:57:54,534 --> 01:58:00,306
YOU MAY HAVE CONTACT WITH? 

3731
01:58:00,306 --> 01:58:01,240
DO YOU BUNDLE THAT PERMISSION? 

3732
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:03,810
OR AM I ABLE TO INDIVIDUALLY SAY

3733
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:08,214
WHAT I'M WILLING FOR YOU TO 

3734
01:58:08,214 --> 01:58:09,348
WATCH, AND WHAT I DON'T WANT 

3735
01:58:09,348 --> 01:58:13,452
YOU TO WATCH? 

3736
01:58:13,452 --> 01:58:14,954
AND I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE 

3737
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:16,088
THAT FOR THE RECORD, BASED ON 

3738
01:58:16,088 --> 01:58:16,656
EVERYBODY ELSE'S TIME. 

3739
01:58:16,656 --> 01:58:19,458
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 

3740
01:58:19,458 --> 01:58:25,264
>> MR. ZUCKERBERG, WOULD YOU BE 

3741
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:26,199
COMFORTABLE SHARING WITH US THE 

3742
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:27,533
NAME OF THE HOTEL YOU STAYED IN 

3743
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:29,602
LAST NIGHT?  

3744
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:35,207
>> NO. 

3745
01:58:35,207 --> 01:58:36,909
>> IF YOU HAVE MESSAGED ANYBODY 

3746
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:40,646
THIS WEEK, WOULD YOU SHARE WITH 

3747
01:58:40,646 --> 01:58:41,948
US THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE YOU 

3748
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:42,882
HAVE MESSAGED? 

3749
01:58:42,882 --> 01:58:46,852
>> SENATOR, NO, I WOULD 

3750
01:58:46,852 --> 01:58:47,953
PROBABLY NOT CHOOSE TO DO THAT 

3751
01:58:47,953 --> 01:58:48,320
PUBLICLY HERE. 

3752
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,655
>> I THINK THAT MAYBE WHAT THIS 

3753
01:58:49,655 --> 01:58:50,223
IS ALL ABOUT. 

3754
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:50,956
YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY. 

3755
01:58:50,956 --> 01:58:52,524
THE LIMITS OF YOUR RIGHT TO 

3756
01:58:52,524 --> 01:58:56,429
PRIVACY. 

3757
01:58:56,429 --> 01:58:57,697
AND HOW MUCH YOU GIVE AWAY IN 

3758
01:58:57,697 --> 01:58:58,831
MODERN AMERICA, IN THE NAME OF, 

3759
01:58:58,831 --> 01:59:00,166
QUOTE, CONNECTING PEOPLE AROUND 

3760
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:01,634
THE WORLD. 

3761
01:59:01,634 --> 01:59:03,069
THE QUESTION BASICALLY OF, WHAT 

3762
01:59:03,069 --> 01:59:08,407
INFORMATION FACEBOOK IS 

3763
01:59:08,407 --> 01:59:09,141
COLLECTING, WHO THEY ARE 

3764
01:59:09,141 --> 01:59:10,276
SENDING IT TO, AND WHETHER THEY 

3765
01:59:10,276 --> 01:59:11,576
HAVE ASKED ME IN ADVANCE. 

3766
01:59:11,576 --> 01:59:12,578
MY PERMISSION TO DO THAT. 

3767
01:59:12,578 --> 01:59:14,513
IS THAT A FAIR THING FOR A USER 

3768
01:59:14,513 --> 01:59:18,351
OF FACEBOOK TO EXPECT? 

3769
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:18,884
>> YES, SENATOR. 

3770
01:59:18,884 --> 01:59:19,852
I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE 

3771
01:59:19,852 --> 01:59:20,586
CONTROL OVER HOW THE 

3772
01:59:20,586 --> 01:59:21,354
INFORMATION IS USED. 

3773
01:59:21,354 --> 01:59:22,655
AND AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN 

3774
01:59:22,655 --> 01:59:24,189
SOME OF THEIR OTHER QUESTIONS, 

3775
01:59:24,189 --> 01:59:25,458
I THINK THAT IS LAID OUT IN 

3776
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:28,261
SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS. 

3777
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:29,228
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU WANT 

3778
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:30,730
TO GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL IN THE 

3779
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:31,164
PRODUCT ITSELF. 

3780
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:32,198
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY THAT 

3781
01:59:32,198 --> 01:59:37,503
THIS HAPPENS ACROSS OUR SERVICES

3782
01:59:37,503 --> 01:59:38,738
IS, THAT EVERY DAY, PEOPLE COME 

3783
01:59:38,738 --> 01:59:39,872
TO OUR SERVICES TO CHOOSE TO 

3784
01:59:39,872 --> 01:59:41,574
SHARE PHOTOS OR SEND MESSAGES. 

3785
01:59:41,574 --> 01:59:42,608
AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY 

3786
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:46,645
CHOOSE TO SHARE SOMETHING, THEY 

3787
01:59:46,645 --> 01:59:47,580
HAVE A CONTROL RIGHT THERE 

3788
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:48,881
ABOUT WHO THEY WANT TO SHARE IT 

3789
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:49,114
WITH. 

3790
01:59:49,114 --> 01:59:50,216
BUT THAT LEVEL OF CONTROL IS 

3791
01:59:50,216 --> 01:59:50,683
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 

3792
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:51,117
>> THEY 

3793
02:00:13,205 --> 02:00:17,442
>> YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE 

3794
02:00:17,442 --> 02:00:18,911
DEVELOPER PLATFORM AND I WILL 

3795
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:20,946
GIVE YOU BACKGROUND IF THAT IS 

3796
02:00:20,946 --> 02:00:21,280
USEFUL. 

3797
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,481
>> I HAVE THREE MINUTES LESS 

3798
02:00:22,481 --> 02:00:23,382
AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF 

3799
02:00:23,382 --> 02:00:29,288
QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK. 

3800
02:00:29,288 --> 02:00:32,792
YOU HAVE ANNOUNCED SOMETHING 

3801
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:34,193
THAT IS CALLED MESSENGER KIDS.  

3802
02:00:34,193 --> 02:00:39,932
THERE IS AN APP FOR KIDS 6 AND 

3803
02:00:39,932 --> 02:00:41,766
12 TO SEND VIDEO TEXT MESSAGES 

3804
02:00:41,766 --> 02:00:53,778
AND YOU HAVE CARTOON  FEATURES 

3805
02:00:53,778 --> 02:00:55,114
FOR THIS.  

3806
02:00:55,114 --> 02:00:56,382
AND THERE IS CHILDHOOD 

3807
02:00:56,382 --> 02:00:57,683
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS THAT 

3808
02:00:57,683 --> 02:00:59,285
WARNED FACEBOOK AND 

3809
02:00:59,285 --> 02:01:00,219
DEMONSTRATED THAT EXCESSIVE USE 

3810
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:01,587
OF DIGITAL DEVICES AND SOCIAL 

3811
02:01:01,587 --> 02:01:02,988
MEDIA IS HARMFUL TO KIDS AND 

3812
02:01:02,988 --> 02:01:06,192
ARGUED THAT YOUNG CHILDREN ARE 

3813
02:01:06,192 --> 02:01:08,026
NOT READY TO HANDLE SOCIAL 

3814
02:01:08,026 --> 02:01:08,794
MEDIA ACCOUNTS AT AGE 6. 

3815
02:01:08,794 --> 02:01:11,696
IN ADDITION THERE ARE CONCERNS 

3816
02:01:11,696 --> 02:01:12,865
ABOUT DATA BEING GATHERED ABOUT 

3817
02:01:12,865 --> 02:01:13,198
THESE KIDS.  

3818
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:15,968
NOW THERE IS CERTAIN LIMITS IN 

3819
02:01:15,968 --> 02:01:19,271
THE LAW, WE KNOW, CHILDREN'S 

3820
02:01:19,271 --> 02:01:20,873
ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT.  

3821
02:01:20,873 --> 02:01:23,109
WHAT GUARANTEES CAN YOU GIVE US 

3822
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:25,377
THAT NO DATA FROM MESSENGER 

3823
02:01:25,377 --> 02:01:27,312
KIDS WILL BE COLLECTED OR 

3824
02:01:27,312 --> 02:01:28,280
SHARED WITH THOSE THAT MIGHT 

3825
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:28,713
VIOLATE THAT LAW? 

3826
02:01:28,713 --> 02:01:29,382
>> ALL RIGHT.  

3827
02:01:29,382 --> 02:01:33,218
SENATOR, SO A NUMBER OF THINGS 

3828
02:01:33,218 --> 02:01:36,155
I THINK ARE IMPORTANT HERE.  

3829
02:01:36,155 --> 02:01:37,789
BACKGROUND ON MESSENGER KIDS IS 

3830
02:01:37,789 --> 02:01:38,557
THAT WE HEARD FEEDBACK FROM 

3831
02:01:38,557 --> 02:01:39,392
THOUSANDS OF PARENTS THAT THEY 

3832
02:01:39,392 --> 02:01:40,392
WANT TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN 

3833
02:01:40,392 --> 02:01:43,229
TOUCH WITH THEIR KIDS AND CALL 

3834
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:47,199
THEM AND USE APPS LIKE FACEBOOK 

3835
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:49,301
WHEN THEY ARE WORKING LATE AND 

3836
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:50,535
NOT AROUND SO THEY WANT 

3837
02:01:50,535 --> 02:01:50,903
CONTROL.  

3838
02:01:50,903 --> 02:01:52,872
WE CAN AGREE IF YOUR KID IS 6 

3839
02:01:52,872 --> 02:01:54,340
OR 7 AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A 

3840
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,075
PHONE YOU WANT TO CONTROL WHO 

3841
02:01:56,075 --> 02:01:57,510
THEY CONTACT AND THERE WAS NOT 

3842
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:01,580
AN APP OUT THERE THAT DID THAT 

3843
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:04,416
SO WE BILL THIS SERVICE.  

3844
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,017
THE APP COLLECTS A MINIMAL 

3845
02:02:06,017 --> 02:02:08,287
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO 

3846
02:02:08,287 --> 02:02:09,488
OPERATE IT.  

3847
02:02:09,488 --> 02:02:11,123
THE MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE SEND 

3848
02:02:11,123 --> 02:02:11,991
IS SOMETHING THAT WE COLLECT TO 

3849
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:14,125
OPERATE THE SERVICE AND IN 

3850
02:02:14,125 --> 02:02:14,827
GENERAL THAT DATA WON'T BE 

3851
02:02:14,827 --> 02:02:17,630
SHARED WITH 3rd PARTIES AND NOT 

3852
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:19,131
CONNECTED TO THE BROADER 

3853
02:02:19,131 --> 02:02:19,431
FACEBOOK -- 

3854
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:21,934
>> EXCUSE ME, AS A LAWYER I 

3855
02:02:21,934 --> 02:02:23,802
PICKED UP ON THAT WORD IN 

3856
02:02:23,802 --> 02:02:24,737
GENERAL, THAT PHRASE IN 

3857
02:02:24,737 --> 02:02:26,172
GENERAL, IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST IN 

3858
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:29,007
SOME CASES IT WILL BE SHARED 

3859
02:02:29,007 --> 02:02:29,508
WITH THIRD PARTIES. 

3860
02:02:29,508 --> 02:02:30,609
>> NO, IT WILL NOT. 

3861
02:02:30,609 --> 02:02:31,110
>> ALL RIGHT.  

3862
02:02:31,110 --> 02:02:34,580
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THE IDEA 

3863
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:35,948
THAT SOMEONE HAVING REACHED 

3864
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:38,083
ADULT AGE AND HAVING GROWN UP 

3865
02:02:38,083 --> 02:02:42,588
WITH MESSENGER KIDS SHOULD BE 

3866
02:02:42,588 --> 02:02:45,558
ALLOWED TO DELETE THE DATA THAT 

3867
02:02:45,558 --> 02:02:45,925
YOU COLLECTED? 

3868
02:02:45,925 --> 02:02:46,158
>> YES. 

3869
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:48,427
AS A MATTER OF FACT WHEN YOU 

3870
02:02:48,427 --> 02:02:49,295
BECOME 13, OUR LIMIT WHERE WE 

3871
02:02:49,295 --> 02:02:51,197
DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE UNDER THE 

3872
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:54,800
AGE OF 13 TO USE FACEBOOK, YOU 

3873
02:02:54,800 --> 02:03:00,372
DON AUTOMATICALLY GO FR 

3874
02:03:00,372 --> 02:03:01,440
HAVING A MESSENGER KID APP BUT 

3875
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:01,907
START OVER.  

3876
02:03:01,907 --> 02:03:04,176
IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE SURE 

3877
02:03:04,176 --> 02:03:05,778
IT IS DELETED AND PEOPLE WILL 

3878
02:03:05,778 --> 02:03:11,216
START OVER WHEN THEY GET THEIR 

3879
02:03:11,216 --> 02:03:12,350
FACEBOOK OR OTHER ACCOUNTS. 

3880
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:14,653
>> ILLINOIS HAS A BIOMETRIC 

3881
02:03:14,653 --> 02:03:18,190
INFORMATION ACT, OUR STATE DOES 

3882
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:22,627
WHICH IS TO REGULATE THE 

3883
02:03:22,627 --> 02:03:25,798
COMMERCIAL USE OF FACIAL AND 

3884
02:03:25,798 --> 02:03:26,932
IRI SETTLEMENT SCANS AND THE 

3885
02:03:26,932 --> 02:03:27,500
LIKE. 

3886
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,667
FACEBOOK HAS THE EXCEPTION TO 

3887
02:03:28,667 --> 02:03:31,270
THAT.  

3888
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:38,243
I HOPE YOU WILL FILL ME IN ON 

3889
02:03:38,243 --> 02:03:42,347
THAT PROTECTING PRIVACY. 

3890
02:03:42,347 --> 02:03:44,416
>> THANK YOU. 

3891
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:45,117
>> SENATOR CORNNIN.  

3892
02:03:45,117 --> 02:03:47,152
I KNOW UP UNTIL 2014 THE MONTRA 

3893
02:03:47,152 --> 02:03:49,121
OF FACEBOOK WAS TO MOVE FAST 

3894
02:03:49,121 --> 02:03:49,788
AND BREAK THINGS, IS THAT 

3895
02:03:49,788 --> 02:03:50,055
CORRECT? 

3896
02:03:50,055 --> 02:03:52,824
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE CHANGED 

3897
02:03:52,824 --> 02:03:57,763
IT BUT THE MONTRA IS CURRENTLY 

3898
02:03:57,763 --> 02:03:58,630
MOVE FAST WITH FAST WITH STABLE 

3899
02:03:58,630 --> 02:03:58,997
INFRASTRUCTURE. 

3900
02:03:58,997 --> 02:03:59,898
>> THAT SOUNDS MORE BORING BUT 

3901
02:03:59,898 --> 02:04:03,601
MY QUESTION IS DURING THE TIME 

3902
02:04:03,601 --> 02:04:04,470
THAT IT WAS FACEBOOK'S MONTRA 

3903
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:06,472
OR MOTTO TO MOVE FAST AND BREAK 

3904
02:04:06,472 --> 02:04:13,212
THINGS, DO YOU THINK SOME OF 

3905
02:04:13,212 --> 02:04:13,745
THE MISJUDGMENTS PERHAPS, 

3906
02:04:13,745 --> 02:04:15,247
MISTAKES THAT YOU HAVE ADMITTED 

3907
02:04:15,247 --> 02:04:17,516
TO HERE WERE AS A RESULT OF 

3908
02:04:17,516 --> 02:04:18,617
THAT CULTURE OR THAT ATTITUDE 

3909
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:21,053
PARTICULARLY IN REGARDS TO 

3910
02:04:21,053 --> 02:04:22,888
PERSONAL PRIVACY OF INFORMATION 

3911
02:04:22,888 --> 02:04:23,555
OF YOUR SUBSCRIBERS? 

3912
02:04:23,555 --> 02:04:30,129
>> SENATOR, I DO THINK THAT WE 

3913
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:30,862
MADE MISTAKES BECAUSE OF THAT 

3914
02:04:30,862 --> 02:04:33,832
BUT THE BROADEST MISTAKES THAT 

3915
02:04:33,832 --> 02:04:37,402
WE MADE HERE ARE NOT TAKING A 

3916
02:04:37,402 --> 02:04:40,438
BROAD ENOUGH VIEW OF OUR 

3917
02:04:40,438 --> 02:04:40,940
RESPONSIBILITY.  

3918
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:44,009
THE MOVE FAST CULTURAL VALUE IS 

3919
02:04:44,009 --> 02:04:45,043
MORE TACTICAL AROUND WHETHER 

3920
02:04:45,043 --> 02:04:45,811
ENGINEERS CAN SHIP THINGS AND 

3921
02:04:45,811 --> 02:04:47,413
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE OPERATE. 

3922
02:04:47,413 --> 02:04:48,714
BUT I THINK THE BIG MISTAKE 

3923
02:04:48,714 --> 02:04:51,216
THAT WE MADE LOOKING BACK ON 

3924
02:04:51,216 --> 02:04:53,619
THIS IS VIEWING OUR 

3925
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:55,353
RESPONSIBILITY AS JUST BUILDING 

3926
02:04:55,353 --> 02:04:56,622
TOOLS RATHER THAN VIEWING OUR 

3927
02:04:56,622 --> 02:04:57,256
WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY AS MAKING 

3928
02:04:57,256 --> 02:05:04,530
SURE THAT THE TOOLS ARE USED 

3929
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:04,930
FOR GOOD. 

3930
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:05,497
>> WELL I APPRECIATE THAT. 

3931
02:05:05,497 --> 02:05:07,298
BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY OR EARLY -- 

3932
02:05:07,298 --> 02:05:11,136
IN THE PAST WE HAVE BEEN TOLD 

3933
02:05:11,136 --> 02:05:12,070
THAT PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK, 

3934
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:14,572
TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM AND THE 

3935
02:05:14,572 --> 02:05:16,875
LIKE ARE NEUTRAL PLATFORMS AND 

3936
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:18,376
THE PEOPLE THAT OWN AND RUN 

3937
02:05:18,376 --> 02:05:22,114
THOSE FOR PROFIT AND I AM NOT 

3938
02:05:22,114 --> 02:05:24,182
CRITICIZING DOING SOMETHING FOR 

3939
02:05:24,182 --> 02:05:27,987
PROFIT IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT 

3940
02:05:27,987 --> 02:05:29,321
THEY BOR NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

3941
02:05:29,321 --> 02:05:30,222
THE CONTENT.  

3942
02:05:30,222 --> 02:05:32,557
DO YOU AGREE NOW THAT FACEBOOK 

3943
02:05:32,557 --> 02:05:34,626
AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA 

3944
02:05:34,626 --> 02:05:37,495
PLATFORMS ARE NOT NEUTRAL BUT 

3945
02:05:37,495 --> 02:05:38,731
BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

3946
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:39,832
THE CONTENT? 

3947
02:05:39,832 --> 02:05:40,598
>> I AGREE THAT WE ARE 

3948
02:05:40,598 --> 02:05:42,167
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT. 

3949
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:44,269
AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BIG 

3950
02:05:44,269 --> 02:05:46,171
SOCIETAL QUESTIONS THAT I THINK 

3951
02:05:46,171 --> 02:05:50,109
WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO ANSWER 

3952
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:52,111
IS THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK THAT 

3953
02:05:52,111 --> 02:05:54,847
WE HAVE IS BASED ON THIS 

3954
02:05:54,847 --> 02:05:55,414
REACTIVE MODEL THAT ASSUMES 

3955
02:05:55,414 --> 02:05:58,484
THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY TOOLS 

3956
02:05:58,484 --> 02:05:59,451
THAT WOULD PROACTIVELY TELL 

3957
02:05:59,451 --> 02:06:01,920
WHETHER SOMETHING WAS TERRORIST 

3958
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,756
CONTENT OR SOMETHING BAD SO IT 

3959
02:06:03,756 --> 02:06:04,623
NATURALLY RELIED ON REQUIRING 

3960
02:06:04,623 --> 02:06:07,393
PEOPLE TO FLAG FOR A COMPANY 

3961
02:06:07,393 --> 02:06:08,227
AND THE COMPANY NEEDING TO TAKE 

3962
02:06:08,227 --> 02:06:08,660
REASONABLE ACTION.  

3963
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:10,863
IN THE FUTURE, WE ARE GOING TO 

3964
02:06:10,863 --> 02:06:14,733
HAVE TOOLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE 

3965
02:06:14,733 --> 02:06:16,401
ABLE TO IDENTIFY MORE TYPES OF 

3966
02:06:16,401 --> 02:06:17,436
BAD CONTENT AND THERE ARE MORAL 

3967
02:06:17,436 --> 02:06:18,604
AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND 

3968
02:06:18,604 --> 02:06:20,205
QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WE WILL 

3969
02:06:20,205 --> 02:06:21,407
HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH AS A 

3970
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:23,709
SOCIETY ABOUT WHEN WE WANT TO 

3971
02:06:23,709 --> 02:06:25,611
REQUIRE COMPANIES TO TAKE 

3972
02:06:25,611 --> 02:06:26,978
ACTION, PROACTIVELY ON CERTAIN 

3973
02:06:26,978 --> 02:06:27,378
OF THOSE THINGS.  

3974
02:06:27,378 --> 02:06:29,748
AND WHEN THAT GETS IN THE WAY 

3975
02:06:29,748 --> 02:06:30,015
-- 

3976
02:06:30,015 --> 02:06:30,616
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.  

3977
02:06:30,616 --> 02:06:34,319
I HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT TO ASK 

3978
02:06:34,319 --> 02:06:34,720
YOU QUESTIONS.  

3979
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:35,554
SO INTERESTINGLY THE TERMS OF 

3980
02:06:35,554 --> 02:06:40,726
THE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, THE 

3981
02:06:40,726 --> 02:06:42,728
TERMS OF SERVICE IS A LEGAL 

3982
02:06:42,728 --> 02:06:44,830
DOCUMENT THAT DISCLOSES TO YOUR 

3983
02:06:44,830 --> 02:06:46,932
SUBSCRIBERS HOW THE INFORMATION 

3984
02:06:46,932 --> 02:06:52,438
IS USED AND HOW FACEBOOK WILL 

3985
02:06:52,438 --> 02:06:52,738
OPERATE.  

3986
02:06:52,738 --> 02:06:56,341
BUT YOU CONCEDE THAT YOU DOUBT 

3987
02:06:56,341 --> 02:06:57,142
EVERYONE READS OR UNDERSTANDS 

3988
02:06:57,142 --> 02:06:58,509
THAT LEGALESE, THOSE TERMS OF 

3989
02:06:58,509 --> 02:07:02,681
SERVICE SO IS THAT TO SUGGEST 

3990
02:07:02,681 --> 02:07:04,349
THAT THE CONSENT THAT PEOPLE 

3991
02:07:04,349 --> 02:07:08,720
GIVE SUBJECT TO THAT TERMS OF 

3992
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:09,221
SERVICE IS NOT INFORMED 

3993
02:07:09,221 --> 02:07:09,488
CONSENT? 

3994
02:07:09,488 --> 02:07:10,055
IN OTHER WORDS THEY MAY NOT 

3995
02:07:10,055 --> 02:07:11,790
READ IT AND IF THEY DON'T READ 

3996
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:13,726
IT, THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND IT? 

3997
02:07:13,726 --> 02:07:16,394
>> I THINK WE HAVE A BROADER 

3998
02:07:16,394 --> 02:07:18,730
RESPONSIBILITY THAN WHAT THE

02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:19,164
LAW REQUIRES SO -- 

4000
02:07:19,164 --> 02:07:19,831
>> I'M TALKING -- I APPRECIATE 

4001
02:07:19,831 --> 02:07:20,065
THAT.  

4002
02:07:20,065 --> 02:07:25,304
WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT IN TERMS 

4003
02:07:25,304 --> 02:07:26,104

4004
02:07:26,104 --> 02:07:27,238

DATA WILL BE USED.  

4006
02:07:29,942 --> 02:07:31,643
BUT LET ME GO TO THE TERMS OF 

4007
02:07:31,643 --> 02:07:32,277
SERVICE UNDER PARAGRAPH NUMBER 

4008
02:07:32,277 --> 02:07:36,148
2, YOU SAY YOU OWN ALL OF THE 

4009
02:07:36,148 --> 02:07:36,715
CONTENT AND INFORMATION YOU 

4010
02:07:36,715 --> 02:07:37,315
POST ON FACEBOOK.  

4011
02:07:37,315 --> 02:07:40,719
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US 

4012
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:47,059
HERE TODAY A NUMBER OF TIMES.  

4013
02:07:47,059 --> 02:07:49,728
SO IF I CHOOSE TO TERMINATE MY 

4014
02:07:49,728 --> 02:07:50,929
FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, CAN I BAR 

4015
02:07:50,929 --> 02:07:52,331
FACEBOOK OR ANY THIRD PARTY 

4016
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:56,535
FROM USING THE DATA THAT I HAD 

4017
02:07:56,535 --> 02:07:58,570
PREVIOUSLY SUPPLIED FOR ANY 

4018
02:07:58,570 --> 02:07:59,004
PURPOSE WHATSOEVER? 

4019
02:07:59,004 --> 02:08:00,406
>> YES, SENATOR.  

4020
02:08:00,406 --> 02:08:01,039
IF YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT WE 

4021
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:02,841
SHOULD GET RID OF ALL YOUR 

4022
02:08:02,841 --> 02:08:03,174
INFORMATION. 

4023
02:08:03,174 --> 02:08:04,543
>> YOU SHOULD OR DO YOU. 

4024
02:08:04,543 --> 02:08:05,443
>> WE DO. 

4025
02:08:05,443 --> 02:08:06,845
>> HOW ABOUT THIRD PARTIES THAT 

4026
02:08:06,845 --> 02:08:10,782
YOU HAVE CONTRACTED WITH TO USE 

4027
02:08:10,782 --> 02:08:13,018
SOME OF THAT UNDERLYING 

4028
02:08:13,018 --> 02:08:15,086
INFORMATION PERHAPS TO TARGET 

4029
02:08:15,086 --> 02:08:17,255
ADVERTISING FOR THEMSELVES?  

4030
02:08:17,255 --> 02:08:18,824
YOU CAN'T -- DO YOU -- DO YOU 

4031
02:08:18,824 --> 02:08:20,359
GET BACK THAT INFORMATION AS 

4032
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:22,026
WELL OR DOES THAT REMAIN IN 

4033
02:08:22,026 --> 02:08:22,393
THEIR CUSTODY? 

4034
02:08:22,393 --> 02:08:23,595
>> SENATOR, THIS IS A VERY 

4035
02:08:23,595 --> 02:08:24,262
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I'M GLAD 

4036
02:08:24,262 --> 02:08:26,464
YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BECAUSE 

4037
02:08:26,464 --> 02:08:27,766
THERE IS A VERY COMMON 

4038
02:08:27,766 --> 02:08:29,400
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT FACEBOOK 

4039
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:29,901
THAT WE SELL DATA TO 

4040
02:08:29,901 --> 02:08:31,937
ADVERTISERS.  

4041
02:08:31,937 --> 02:08:36,441
AND WE DO NOT SELL DATA TO 

4042
02:08:36,441 --> 02:08:37,276
ADVERTISERS. 

4043
02:08:37,276 --> 02:08:37,943
>> YOU CLEARLY RENT IT. 

4044
02:08:37,943 --> 02:08:39,044
>> WE ALLOW ADVERTISERS TO TELL 

4045
02:08:39,044 --> 02:08:41,914
US WHO THEY WANT TO REACH AND 

4046
02:08:41,914 --> 02:08:42,514
WE DO THE PLACEMENT.  

4047
02:08:42,514 --> 02:08:45,149
SO IF AN ADVERTISER COMES TO US 

4048
02:08:45,149 --> 02:08:48,487
AND SAY I AM A SKI SHOP AND I 

4049
02:08:48,487 --> 02:08:50,556
WANT TO SELL SKIS TO WOMEN THEN 

4050
02:08:50,556 --> 02:08:53,125
WE MIGHT HAVE SOME SENSE 

4051
02:08:53,125 --> 02:08:57,996
BECAUSE PEOPLE SHARED SKIING-

4052
02:08:57,996 --> 02:08:58,596
RELATED CONTENT INTEREST IN 

4053
02:08:58,596 --> 02:09:02,734
THAT AND THEY WERE A WOMAN AND 

4054
02:09:02,734 --> 02:09:04,803
WE COULD SHOW THE ADS WITHOUT 

4055
02:09:04,803 --> 02:09:05,570
THAT DATA GOING TO THE 

4056
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:06,671
ADVERTISER.  

4057
02:09:06,671 --> 02:09:09,041
THIS IS A A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF 

4058
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:10,242
OUR MOTTO AND MISUNDERSTOOD.  

4059
02:09:10,242 --> 02:09:14,646
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT 

4060
02:09:14,646 --> 02:09:14,913
THAT UP. 

4061
02:09:14,913 --> 02:09:15,713
>> THANK YOU SENATOR CORENIN. 

4062
02:09:15,713 --> 02:09:17,915
>> WE INDICATED THAT WE WOULD 

4063
02:09:17,915 --> 02:09:18,483
TAKE A COUPLE OF BREAKS AND 

4064
02:09:18,483 --> 02:09:20,051
GIVE OUR WITNESS AN OPPORTUNITY 

4065
02:09:20,051 --> 02:09:22,254
AND WE HAVE BEEN GOING FOR 

4066
02:09:22,254 --> 02:09:22,754
UNTWO HOURS, I THINK -- 

4067
02:09:22,754 --> 02:09:26,792
>> WE CAN DO A FEW MORE. 

4068
02:09:26,792 --> 02:09:28,593
>> YOU WANT TO KEEP GOING? 

4069
02:09:28,593 --> 02:09:30,194
>> MAYBE 15 MINUTES. 

4070
02:09:30,194 --> 02:09:30,461
>> OKAY. 

4071
02:09:30,461 --> 02:09:36,935
>> DOES THAT WORK? 

4072
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:38,403
>> WE WILL KEEP GOING.  

4073
02:09:38,403 --> 02:09:40,606
SENATOR BLOOMENTHAL IS UP NEXT. 

4074
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:43,242
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN FOR 

4075
02:09:43,242 --> 02:09:43,709
BEING HERE TODAY MR. 

4076
02:09:43,709 --> 02:09:44,042
ZUCKERBERG.  

4077
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:51,550
YOU HAVE TOLD US TODAY AND YOU 

4078
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:52,384
HAVE TOLD THE WORLD THAT 

4079
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,419
FACEBOOK WAS DECEIVED BY 

4080
02:09:54,419 --> 02:09:57,356
ALEXANDER COLGAN WHEN HE SOLD 

4081
02:09:57,356 --> 02:09:57,956
INFORMATION TO CAMBRIDGE 

4082
02:09:57,956 --> 02:09:58,489
ANALYTICA, CORRECT? 

4083
02:09:58,489 --> 02:09:58,756
>> YES. 

4084
02:09:58,756 --> 02:10:06,631
>> I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE TERMS 

4085
02:10:06,631 --> 02:10:09,968
OF SERVICE THAT ALEXANDER 

4086
02:10:09,968 --> 02:10:10,602
COLDGAN PROVIDED TO FACEBOOK. 

4087
02:10:10,602 --> 02:10:15,107
AND NOTE FOR YOU THAT IN FACT 

4088
02:10:15,107 --> 02:10:18,476
FACEBOOK WAS ON NOTICE THAT HE 

4089
02:10:18,476 --> 02:10:18,943
COULD SELL THAT USER 

4090
02:10:18,943 --> 02:10:19,277
INFORMATION.  

4091
02:10:19,277 --> 02:10:25,250
HAVE YOU SEEN THESE TERMS OF 

4092
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:25,683
SERVICE BEFORE? 

4093
02:10:25,683 --> 02:10:27,519
>> I HAVE NOT. 

4094
02:10:27,519 --> 02:10:28,186
>> WHO IN FACEBOOK WAS 

4095
02:10:28,186 --> 02:10:33,258
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEING THOSE 

4096
02:10:33,258 --> 02:10:35,460
TERMS OF SERVICE THAT PUT 

4097
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:36,661
OUTSTANDING NOTICE THAT THAT 

4098
02:10:36,661 --> 02:10:38,864
INFORMATION COULD BE SOLD? 

4099
02:10:38,864 --> 02:10:40,465
>> SENATOR, OUR APP REVIEW TEAM 

4100
02:10:40,465 --> 02:10:42,167
WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. 

4101
02:10:42,167 --> 02:10:44,403
>> HAS ANYONE BEEN FIRED ON 

4102
02:10:44,403 --> 02:10:49,941
THAT APP REVIEW TEAM? 

4103
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:52,945
>> SENATOR, NOT BECAUSE OF 

4104
02:10:52,945 --> 02:10:53,145
THIS. 

4105
02:10:53,145 --> 02:10:56,281
>> DOESN'T THAT TERM OF SERVICE 

4106
02:10:56,281 --> 02:10:59,151
CONFLICT WITH THE FTC ORDER 

4107
02:10:59,151 --> 02:11:01,753
THAT FACEBOOK WAS UNDER AT THAT 

4108
02:11:01,753 --> 02:11:09,795
VERY TIME THAT THIS TERM OF 

4109
02:11:09,795 --> 02:11:15,267
SERVICE WAS IN FACT PROVIDED TO 

4110
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:16,268
FACEBOOK AND YOU'LL NOTE THAT 

4111
02:11:16,268 --> 02:11:19,905
THE FTC ORDER ORDERS THEM TO 

4112
02:11:19,905 --> 02:11:21,273
PROTECT PRIVACY, ISN'T THAT A 

4113
02:11:21,273 --> 02:11:21,540
CONFLICT? 

4114
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:22,073
>> SENATOR, IT CERTAINLY 

4115
02:11:22,073 --> 02:11:24,776
APPEARS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE 

4116
02:11:24,776 --> 02:11:25,343
BEEN AWARE THAT THIS APP 

4117
02:11:25,343 --> 02:11:28,380
DEVELOPER SUBMITTED A TERM THAT 

4118
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:30,949
WAS IN CONFLICT WITH THE RULES 

4119
02:11:30,949 --> 02:11:31,349
OF THE PLATFORM. 

4120
02:11:31,349 --> 02:11:37,021
>> WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS IN 

4121
02:11:37,021 --> 02:11:38,056
EFFECT WILLFUL BLINDNESS.  

4122
02:11:38,056 --> 02:11:40,124
IT WAS HEEDLESS AND RECKLESS 

4123
02:11:40,124 --> 02:11:43,795
WHICH IN FACT AMOUNTED TO A 

4124
02:11:43,795 --> 02:11:45,664
VIOLENCE OF THE FTC CONSENT 

4125
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:47,866
DECREE, WOULD YOU AGREE? 

4126
02:11:47,866 --> 02:11:48,567
>> NO, SENATOR.  

4127
02:11:48,567 --> 02:11:51,169
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS 

4128
02:11:51,169 --> 02:11:53,205
NOT THAT THIS WAS A VIOLENCE OF 

4129
02:11:53,205 --> 02:11:55,140
THE CONSENT DECREE BUT AS I 

4130
02:11:55,140 --> 02:11:56,241
HAVE SAID A NUMBER OF TIMES 

4131
02:11:56,241 --> 02:12:02,014
TODAY I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A 

4132
02:12:02,014 --> 02:12:03,582
BROADER VIEW AND RESPONSIBILITY 

4133
02:12:03,582 --> 02:12:04,015
ABOUT THE PRIVACY. 

4134
02:12:04,015 --> 02:12:06,251
>> HERE IS MY RESERVATION, MR. 

4135
02:12:06,251 --> 02:12:07,718
ZUCKERBERG, I APOLOGY FOR 

4136
02:12:07,718 --> 02:12:09,320
INTERRUPTING BUT MY TIME IS 

4137
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:09,687
LIMITED.  

4138
02:12:09,687 --> 02:12:12,457
WE HAVE SEEN THE APOLOGY TOURS 

4139
02:12:12,457 --> 02:12:12,724
BEFORE.  

4140
02:12:12,724 --> 02:12:16,094
YOU HAVE REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE 

4141
02:12:16,094 --> 02:12:20,565
EVEN AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO 

4142
02:12:20,565 --> 02:12:22,167
HAVE REPORTED THIS VIOLENCE OF 

4143
02:12:22,167 --> 02:12:24,569
THE FTC CONSENT DECREE AND WE 

4144
02:12:24,569 --> 02:12:27,239
HAVE LETTERS AND WE HAVE HAD 

4145
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:28,140
CONTACTS WITH FACEBOOK 

4146
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:29,173
EMPLOYEES AND I'M GOING TO 

4147
02:12:29,173 --> 02:12:35,480
SUBMIT A LETTER FOR THE RECORD 

4148
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,214
FROM SANDY PARAKEELIS WITH YOUR 

4149
02:12:36,214 --> 02:12:36,547
PERMISSION.  

4150
02:12:36,547 --> 02:12:39,718
THAT INDICATES NOT ONLY A LACK 

4151
02:12:39,718 --> 02:12:44,422
OF RESOURCES BUT LACK OF 

4152
02:12:44,422 --> 02:12:49,194
ATTENTION TO PRIVACY.  

4153
02:12:49,194 --> 02:12:49,761
AND SO MY RESERVATION ABOUT 

4154
02:12:49,761 --> 02:12:52,564
YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY IS THAT I 

4155
02:12:52,564 --> 02:12:57,469
DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN CHANGE 

4156
02:12:57,469 --> 02:12:58,036
YOUR BUSINESS MOTTO UNLESS 

4157
02:12:58,036 --> 02:13:00,205
THERE ARE SPECIFIC RULES OF THE 

4158
02:13:00,205 --> 02:13:01,706
ROAD.  

4159
02:13:01,706 --> 02:13:06,611
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO 

4160
02:13:06,611 --> 02:13:08,980
MAXIMIZE PRIVATE OVER PRIVACY 

4161
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:13,118
AND UNLESS THERE ARE SPECIFIC 

4162
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:13,752
RULES AND REQUIREMENTS ENFORCED 

4163
02:13:13,752 --> 02:13:18,089
BY AN OUTSIDE AGENCY, I HAVE NO 

4164
02:13:18,089 --> 02:13:22,226
ASSURANCE THAT THESE KINDS OF 

4165
02:13:22,226 --> 02:13:22,860
VAGUE COMMITMENTS ARE GOING TO 

4166
02:13:22,860 --> 02:13:23,261
PRODUCE ACTION.  

4167
02:13:23,261 --> 02:13:27,265
SO I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE 

4168
02:13:27,265 --> 02:13:28,766
OF VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND 

4169
02:13:28,766 --> 02:13:32,370
THEY ARE BASED ON LEGISLATION 

4170
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:41,580
THAT I HAVE OFFERED, MY DATA 

4171
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:45,484
ACT THAT SENATOR MARKIN IS 

4172
02:13:45,484 --> 02:13:47,085
INTRODUCING THE CONSENT APP.  

4173
02:13:47,085 --> 02:13:48,119

4364
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:59,424
NOT ENOUGH TO CONNECT PEOPLE 

4365
02:19:59,424 --> 02:20:00,458
BUT MAKE SURE THE CONNECTIONS 

4366
02:20:00,458 --> 02:20:02,359
ARE POSITIVE AND MAKE SURE THAT 

4367
02:20:02,359 --> 02:20:04,796

WOULD ALL AGREE ARE THAT. 

4387

SERVICE.  

4394
02:20:44,969 --> 02:20:47,572
THAT IS BAD ACTIVITY THAT WE 

4395
02:20:47,572 --> 02:20:49,073
WANT TO GET DOWN AND WE ARE 

4396
02:20:49,073 --> 02:20:50,508
PROUD WITH HOW WE DO THAT. 

4397
02:20:50,508 --> 02:20:53,611

SURE THAT FACEBOOK IS A 

4402
02:20:58,349 --> 02:21:01,319
PLATFORM FOR ALL IDEAS.  

4403
02:21:01,319 --> 02:21:02,120
THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT 

4404
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:03,755
FOUNDING PRINCIPLE OF WHAT WE

4406
02:21:03,955 --> 02:21:04,622
WE ARE PROUD OF THE DISCOURSE 

4407
02:21:04,622 --> 02:21:05,523
AND THE DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT 

4408
02:21:05,523 --> 02:21:08,026
PEOPLE CAN SHARE ON THE SERVICE 

4409
02:21:08,026 --> 02:21:09,627

LONG AS I AM RUNNING THE 

4411
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:14,198

SENATORS AND CLEARLY SOME OF 

4455
02:22:43,387 --> 02:22:44,988
THEM WERE WELL TRAINED AND 

4456
02:22:44,988 --> 02:22:45,689
PREPARED TO ASK TECHNICAL

02:25:16,774 --> 02:25:17,508
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES 

4535
02:25:17,508 --> 02:25:20,611
THAT THE SENATORS GAVE HIM A 

4536
02:25:20,611 --> 02:25:21,846
PASS AND SAID WHY SHOULDN'T 

4537
02:25:21,846 --> 02:25:23,848
THERE BE REGULATION AND HE SAID 

4538
02:25:23,848 --> 02:25:25,483
I AM OKAY WITH THAT. 

4539
02:25:25,483 --> 02:25:27,752
>> I WELCOME IT IF IT IS A

02:25:27,752 --> 02:25:29,053
RIGHT REGULATION.  

4541
02:25:29,053 --> 02:25:32,589
THAT IS A LOADED TERM.  

4542
02:25:32,589 --> 02:25:33,090
BASICALLY REGULATION ON 

4543
02:25:33,090 --> 02:25:34,158
FACEBOOK'S TERMS.  

4544
02:25:34,158 --> 02:25:36,060
AND JEN, THEY PROBABLY ALREADY 

4545
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:37,562
HAVE LOBBYISTS RUNNING THE

02:25:37,562 --> 02:25:38,462
REGULATIONS THEY WANT TO 

4547
02:25:38,462 --> 02:25:39,029
PRESENT TO CONGRESS. 

4548
02:25:39,029 --> 02:25:40,564
>> AT LEAST ONE SENATOR ASKED 

4549
02:25:40,564 --> 02:25:43,333
WILL YOU PLEASE SUBMIT THE

02:25:43,333 --> 02:25:44,569
REGULATIONS THAT YOU THINK WE

SHOULD IMPLEMENT. 

4552

>> IT GOES TO SHOW YOU THERE IS 

4553
02:25:47,404 --> 02:25:48,239
A LACK OF TECHNICAL SAVVY WITH 

4554
02:25:48,239 --> 02:25:51,876
SOME OF THESE SENATORS, THEY 

4555
02:25:51,876 --> 02:25:53,110
ARE NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW TO 

4556
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:54,045
REGULATE THESE COMPANIES. 

4557
02:25:54,045 --> 02:25:54,412

POWERFUL FACEBOOK IS BECAUSE 

4560
02:25:57,114 --> 02:25:59,549
THEY DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THE 

4561
02:25:59,549 --> 02:26:01,051
COMPANY IN REGULATION.  

4562
02:26:01,051 --> 02:26:01,685
IF THERE'S COMMON GROUND WHERE 

4563
02:26:01,685 --> 02:26:05,756
THEY AGREE ON IT START THERE SO 

4564
02:26:05,756 --> 02:26:07,358
THEY WHAT ABOUT THAT 

4565
02:26:07,358 --> 02:26:08,725
INFORMATION FROM MARK 

4566
02:26:08,725 --> 02:26:09,026
ZUCKERBERG. 

4567
02:26:09,026 --> 02:26:10,761
>> AND HE WAS ASK ABOUT THE 

4568
02:26:10,761 --> 02:26:11,395
EUROPEAN REGULATIONS SHOULD BE 

4569
02:26:11,395 --> 02:26:12,964
APPLIED TO THE U.S. AND HE SAYS 

4570
02:26:12,964 --> 02:26:15,099
IT IS WORTH A CONVERSATION. 

4571
02:26:15,099 --> 02:26:16,867
>> WELL, IT IS CERTAINLY WORTH 

4572
02:26:16,867 --> 02:26:18,602
A CONVERSATION FOR HIS PEERS AT 

4573
02:26:18,602 --> 02:26:20,238
OTHER BIG DATA FIRMS.  

4574
02:26:20,238 --> 02:26:21,839
IN FACT WHILE WE WERE WATCHING 

4575
02:26:21,839 --> 02:26:22,740
THERE, I RECEIVED A MESSAGE 

4576
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:24,775
FROM A SOURCE THAT WORKS AT 

4577
02:26:24,775 --> 02:26:26,878
ANOTHER LARGE DATA COMPANY AND 

4578
02:26:26,878 --> 02:26:29,447
HE SAYS HONESTLY, THE GDPR, THE 

4579
02:26:29,447 --> 02:26:30,581
GENERAL DATA PRIVACY REGULATION 

4580
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:32,683
THAT GOES INTO EFFECT IN MAY, 

4581
02:26:32,683 --> 02:26:34,685
ON MAY 25th WILL FIRST OF ALL 

4582
02:26:34,685 --> 02:26:35,753
IT WILL AFFECT EVERY COMPANY 

4583
02:26:35,753 --> 02:26:37,855
BECAUSE THE DATA IN THE CLOUD 

4584
02:26:37,855 --> 02:26:43,727
IS NOT IN ONE LOCATION, IT IS 

4585
02:26:43,727 --> 02:26:45,763
IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS SO BY 

4586
02:26:45,763 --> 02:26:47,698
DEFAULT THEY HAVE TO PROTECT 

4587
02:26:47,698 --> 02:26:50,201
YOUR DATA ACCORDING TO THE 

4588
02:26:50,201 --> 02:26:50,534
REGULATIONS. 

4589
02:26:50,534 --> 02:26:52,536
THE GDPR OR AN AMERICAN VERSION 

4590
02:26:52,536 --> 02:26:55,339
OF THE GDPR COULD HAVE 

4591
02:26:55,339 --> 02:27:00,544
SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR 

4592
02:27:00,544 --> 02:27:03,647
ALMOST EVERY CLOUD AND 

4593
02:27:03,647 --> 02:27:04,348
ALGORITHMLY BASED COMPANY 

4594
02:27:04,348 --> 02:27:06,783
BECAUSE IT WOULD CLAMP DOWN ON 

4595
02:27:06,783 --> 02:27:07,685
THE COMPONENTS AND HOW THEY 

4596
02:27:07,685 --> 02:27:07,952
OPERATE. 

4597
02:27:07,952 --> 02:27:09,086
>> AND WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 

4598
02:27:09,086 --> 02:27:11,388
REGULATION, HE SAYS REMEMBER WE 

4599
02:27:11,388 --> 02:27:14,825
DON'T WANT TO CLAMP DOWN ON 

4600
02:27:14,825 --> 02:27:15,860
INNOVATION AND BROUGHT UP THE 

4601
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:16,360
TECHNOLOGY AROUND FACE 

4602
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,529
RECOGNITION AND THERE ARE MANY 

4603
02:27:18,529 --> 02:27:21,765
WAYS THAT COULD GO WRONG AND HE 

4604
02:27:21,765 --> 02:27:23,601
SAID OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA 

4605
02:27:23,601 --> 02:27:25,069
ARE FULL STEAM AHEAD AND LET'S 

4606
02:27:25,069 --> 02:27:26,537
NOT CLAMP IT DOWN HERE WHICH IS 

4607
02:27:26,537 --> 02:27:30,207
WHAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 

4608
02:27:30,207 --> 02:27:30,574
HAPPY TO HERE.  

4609
02:27:30,574 --> 02:27:33,010
HE SUPPORTS THE HONEST ADS APP 

4610
02:27:33,010 --> 02:27:34,078
THAT AT THIS POINT WILL 

4611
02:27:34,078 --> 02:27:34,945
PROBABLY GO INTO -- 

4612
02:27:34,945 --> 02:27:37,814
>> IT IS SO DEEPLY TIED TO 

4613
02:27:37,814 --> 02:27:43,487
RUSSIA AT THIS POINT.  

4614
02:27:43,487 --> 02:27:44,188
THAT IS AGAIN EASY TERRITORY 

4615
02:27:44,188 --> 02:27:45,089
FOR HIM TO AGREE.  

4616
02:27:45,089 --> 02:27:46,357
HE IS FOCUSING THE REGULATORS 

4617
02:27:46,357 --> 02:27:49,026
ON THINGS THAT HE KNOWS HE 

4618
02:27:49,026 --> 02:27:50,761
NEEDS TO FIX.  

4619
02:27:50,761 --> 02:27:52,429
THIS IS STRATEGIC. 

4620
02:27:52,429 --> 02:27:54,731
>> DAN PATTERSON AND JENNIFER 

4621
02:27:54,731 --> 02:27:56,267
GRIGLE AND ROGER CHANGE.  

4622
02:27:56,267 --> 02:27:59,437
THANK YOU SO MUCH.  

4623
02:27:59,437 --> 02:28:00,137
LAWMAKERS ARE WARNING PRESIDENT 

4624
02:28:00,137 --> 02:28:01,339
TRUMP ABOUT FIRING SPECIAL 

4625
02:28:01,339 --> 02:28:03,174
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER AFTER 

4626
02:28:03,174 --> 02:28:03,874
THE PRESIDENT ATTACKED THE 

4627
02:28:03,874 --> 02:28:05,176
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AS A WITCH-

4628
02:28:05,176 --> 02:28:08,079
HUNT BUT TODAY AT THE WHITE 

4629
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:12,583
HOUSE, SARAH HUCK ABY SANDERS 

4630
02:28:12,583 --> 02:28:13,384
WAS PRESSED ON WHETHER 

4631
02:28:13,384 --> 02:28:14,618
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD THE 

4632
02:28:14,618 --> 02:28:17,655
AUTHORITY AND SHE SAYS HE DOES. 

4633
02:28:17,655 --> 02:28:21,091
>> DOES HE HAVE THE POWER TO 

4634
02:28:21,091 --> 02:28:21,858
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER. 

4635
02:28:21,858 --> 02:28:22,426
>> I BELIEVE SO. 

4636
02:28:22,426 --> 02:28:23,861
>> YOU SAY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

4637
02:28:23,861 --> 02:28:28,932
THE POWER TO DO THAT BECAUSE 

4638
02:28:28,932 --> 02:28:30,468
MOST EXPERTS THINK HE WOULD 

4639
02:28:30,468 --> 02:28:31,969
HAVE TO HIRE ROB LOWEN STINE 

4640
02:28:31,969 --> 02:28:32,536
AND COULD REFUSE. 

4641
02:28:32,536 --> 02:28:33,737
>> I KNOW A NUMBER OF 

4642
02:28:33,737 --> 02:28:34,839
INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL 

4643
02:28:34,839 --> 02:28:35,906
COMMUNITY AND INCLUDING THE 

4644
02:28:35,906 --> 02:28:36,841
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT HE 

4645
02:28:36,841 --> 02:28:40,077
HAS THE POWER TO DO SO BUT I 

4646
02:28:40,077 --> 02:28:41,011
DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER 

4647
02:28:41,011 --> 02:28:43,380
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THAT. 

4648
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:45,583
>> IT IS -- I HAVE ASKED, THEY 

4649
02:28:45,583 --> 02:28:47,518
SAID LOWEN STEEN, ONLY HE HAS 

4650
02:28:47,518 --> 02:28:49,286
THE POWER TO FIND THE SPECIAL 

4651
02:28:49,286 --> 02:28:49,887
COUNSEL. 

4652
02:28:49,887 --> 02:28:51,021
>> AGAIN, WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED 

4653
02:28:51,021 --> 02:28:52,857
THAT THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY 

4654
02:28:52,857 --> 02:28:54,625
HAS THE POWER TO MAKE THAT 

4655
02:28:54,625 --> 02:28:54,892
DECISION. 

4656
02:28:54,892 --> 02:28:58,996
I CAN'T GO ANYTHING BEYOND 

4657
02:28:58,996 --> 02:29:00,564
THAT. 

4658
02:29:00,564 --> 02:29:01,298
>> AFTER THE BRIEFING, JUSTICE 

4659
02:29:01,298 --> 02:29:03,367
REPORTER PAULA REED FILED THIS 

4660
02:29:03,367 --> 02:29:05,469
REPORT DETAILING THE WHITE 

4661
02:29:05,469 --> 02:29:05,869
HOUSE RESPONSE.  

4662
02:29:05,869 --> 02:29:09,673
THE BIGGEST HEAD LINE THAT THE 

4663
02:29:09,673 --> 02:29:11,809
PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE HAS THE 

4664
02:29:11,809 --> 02:29:13,978
UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO FIRE 

4665
02:29:13,978 --> 02:29:15,479
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. 

4666
02:29:15,479 --> 02:29:17,882
JUSTICE OFFICIALS HAVE SAID 

4667
02:29:17,882 --> 02:29:19,683
THAT ONLY ROB ROSENSTEIN 

4668
02:29:19,683 --> 02:29:21,785
OVERSEEING THE INVESTIGATION 

4669
02:29:21,785 --> 02:29:23,320
CAN FIRE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 

4670
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:24,422
AND THE ONE APPOINTED THE 

4671
02:29:24,422 --> 02:29:24,889
SPECIAL COUNSEL.  

4672
02:29:24,889 --> 02:29:27,425
THIS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT 

4673
02:29:27,425 --> 02:29:29,026
DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE WE SAW 

4674
02:29:29,026 --> 02:29:29,660
YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT'S ANGER 

4675
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:31,662
ENTERED A NEW PHASE IN TERMS OF 

4676
02:29:31,662 --> 02:29:35,065
HIS FRUSTRATION IN TERMS OF HIS 

4677
02:29:35,065 --> 02:29:36,200
OWN DEPARTMENT. 

4678
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:36,867
THERE'S TWO INVESTIGATIONS INTO 

4679
02:29:36,867 --> 02:29:38,135
THE PRESIDENT'S CIRCLE AND 

4680
02:29:38,135 --> 02:29:39,970
YESTERDAY THEY WERE APPROVED AT 

4681
02:29:39,970 --> 02:29:42,139
THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE 

4682
02:29:42,139 --> 02:29:42,573
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 

4683
02:29:42,573 --> 02:29:46,076
THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT WHAT 

4684
02:29:46,076 --> 02:29:49,080
HAPPENED IS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

4685
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:50,081
BELIEVES HE ALONE CAN FIRE THE 

4686
02:29:50,081 --> 02:29:50,481
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

4687
02:29:50,481 --> 02:29:54,885
>>> THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ASKED 

4688
02:29:54,885 --> 02:29:57,888
ABOUT THE F.B.I. 

4689
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:58,722
RAID OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

4690
02:29:58,722 --> 02:30:00,257
ATTORNEY.  

4691
02:30:00,257 --> 02:30:02,827
SARAH HUCK ABY DOES NOT KNOW 

4692
02:30:02,827 --> 02:30:04,295
WHETHER HE REPRESENTS THE 

4693
02:30:04,295 --> 02:30:12,269
PRESIDENT AND WHETHER THEY HAD 

4694
02:30:12,269 --> 02:30:15,439
SPOKEN SINCE THE RAID.  

4695
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:22,380
RUSSIA HAD VETOED AN 

4696
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:25,916
INVESTIGATION OVER AN ALLEGE 

4697
02:30:25,916 --> 02:30:26,316
CHEMICAL ATTACK. 

4698
02:30:26,316 --> 02:30:26,983
>>> RUSSIA CLAIM THE RESOLUTION 

4699
02:30:26,983 --> 02:30:27,417
WOULD CREATE A BIAS 

4700
02:30:27,417 --> 02:30:27,884
INVESTIGATIVE FORCE.  

4701
02:30:27,884 --> 02:30:28,819
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE IS 

4702
02:30:28,819 --> 02:30:30,521
CONSIDERING MILITARY OPTIONS IN 

4703
02:30:30,521 --> 02:30:32,156
LIGHT OF THE ATTACK.  

4704
02:30:32,156 --> 02:30:33,557
THOUGH RUSSIA HAS WARNED OF 

4705
02:30:33,557 --> 02:30:35,993
GRAVE REPERCUSSIONS IF THE U.S. 

4706
02:30:35,993 --> 02:30:36,293

02:33:15,185 --> 02:33:16,387
THE SPECIAL OFFICE? 

4716
02:33:16,387 --> 02:33:16,620
>> YES. 

4717
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:16,954
>> HAVE YOU? 

4718
02:33:16,954 --> 02:33:19,523
>> I HAVE NOT. 

4719
02:33:19,523 --> 02:33:19,990
>> I HAVE NOT. 

4720
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:20,357
>> OTHERS HAVE? 

4721
02:33:20,357 --> 02:33:23,293
>> I BELIEVE SO.  

4722
02:33:23,293 --> 02:33:24,695
AND I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE 

4723
02:33:24,695 --> 02:33:27,397
BECAUSE THAT -- OUR WORK WITH 

4724
02:33:27,397 --> 02:33:28,165
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS 

4725
02:33:28,165 --> 02:33:29,800
CONFIDENTIAL AND I WANT TO MAKE 

4726
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:33,370
SURE THAT IN AN OPEN SESSION I 

4727
02:33:33,370 --> 02:33:34,037
AM NOT REVEALING SOMETHING THIS 

4728
02:33:34,037 --> 02:33:34,471
IS A CONFIDENTIAL. 

4729
02:33:34,471 --> 02:33:34,871
>> I UNDERSTAND. 

4730
02:33:34,871 --> 02:33:36,139
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

4731
02:33:36,139 --> 02:33:41,011
YOU HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND YOU 

4732
02:33:41,011 --> 02:33:42,279
HAVE HAD SUBPOENAS. 

4733
02:33:42,279 --> 02:33:45,316
>> ACTUALLY LET ME CLARIFY 

4734
02:33:45,316 --> 02:33:45,516
THAT. 

4735
02:33:45,516 --> 02:33:46,449
I AM NOT AWAY OF A SUBPOENA 

4736
02:33:46,449 --> 02:33:48,852
THERE MAY BE BUT I KNOW WE ARE 

4737
02:33:48,852 --> 02:33:50,621
WORKING WITH THEM. 

4738
02:33:50,621 --> 02:33:55,391
>> THAT WAS FACEBOOK CEO MARK 

4739
02:33:55,391 --> 02:33:57,294
ZUCKERBERG CAUGHT ABOUT THE 

4740
02:33:57,294 --> 02:34:02,132
MUELLER PROBE IN THE 

4741
02:34:02,132 --> 02:34:02,833
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING.  

4742
02:34:02,833 --> 02:34:04,001
LET'S BRING IN ED O'KEEFE FROM 

4743
02:34:04,001 --> 02:34:05,502
WASHINGTON.  

4744
02:34:05,502 --> 02:34:08,705
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?  

4745
02:34:08,705 --> 02:34:09,673
ZUCKERBERG WAS NOT EXPECTING 

4746
02:34:09,673 --> 02:34:10,507
THEM. 

4747
02:34:10,507 --> 02:34:15,712
>> ONE OF THE MOMENTS SO FAR 

4748
02:34:15,712 --> 02:34:17,781
WHEN IT COMES BEYOND GENERAL 

4749
02:34:17,781 --> 02:34:19,316
NEWS AND TECH POLICY WITH WHAT 

4750
02:34:19,316 --> 02:34:21,318
TECH FOLKS WOULD CARE ABOUT 

4751
02:34:21,318 --> 02:34:25,255
CONFIRMING THAT THE COMPANY HAS 

4752
02:34:25,255 --> 02:34:26,456
BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ROBERT 

4753
02:34:26,456 --> 02:34:27,490
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION AND 

4754
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:28,525
SAYS HE HAS NOT BEEN 

4755
02:34:28,525 --> 02:34:29,192
INTERVIEWED AND THAT WOULD MAKE 

4756
02:34:29,192 --> 02:34:32,429
SENSE BECAUSE IT IS A COMPANY 

4757
02:34:32,429 --> 02:34:33,163
THAT EMPLOYS THOUSANDS OF 

4758
02:34:33,163 --> 02:34:36,233
PEOPLE.  

4759
02:34:36,233 --> 02:34:36,766
REGARDLESS IT SHOWS THAT 

4760
02:34:36,766 --> 02:34:37,400
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION COVERS 

4761
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:39,002
THAT FAR AND THE OTHER NEWS IS 

4762
02:34:39,002 --> 02:34:42,272
THE FACT THAT HE HAS DECLINED 

4763
02:34:42,272 --> 02:34:44,407
SO FAR AT LEAST TO COMMIT TO 

4764
02:34:44,407 --> 02:34:46,276
ANY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION OR 

4765
02:34:46,276 --> 02:34:47,544
POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES.  

4766
02:34:47,544 --> 02:34:49,212
HE WAS ASKED TWICE BY DIFFERENT 

4767
02:34:49,212 --> 02:34:50,046
SENATORS WHETHER THE EUROPEAN 

4768
02:34:50,046 --> 02:34:51,148
REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT 

4769
02:34:51,148 --> 02:34:52,248
IN PLACE AND DON'T ASK ME TO 

4770
02:34:52,248 --> 02:34:54,852
CHARACTERIZE WHAT THEY ARE BUT 

4771
02:34:54,852 --> 02:34:55,486
I KNOW THEY ARE PRETTY STRICT, 

4772
02:34:55,486 --> 02:34:57,221
WHETHER THAT MAKES SENSE IN 

4773
02:34:57,221 --> 02:35:00,591
THIS COUNTRY AND HE KIND OF 

4774
02:35:00,591 --> 02:35:02,292
FIRST SAID THAT MAY NOT WORK 

4775
02:35:02,292 --> 02:35:06,597
HERE AND THEN HE SAID IT MIGHT. 

4776
02:35:06,597 --> 02:35:07,264
POTENTIALLY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 

4777
02:35:07,264 --> 02:35:07,664
COULD COME ABOUT. 

4778
02:35:07,664 --> 02:35:11,635
BUT I THINK HE HAS BEEN 

4779
02:35:11,635 --> 02:35:12,302
CONTRITE AND CONTRITE IN SOUND 

4780
02:35:12,302 --> 02:35:12,802
BYTE FRIENDLY WAYS.  

4781
02:35:12,802 --> 02:35:14,504
HE WAS COACHED ON WHAT HE 

4782
02:35:14,504 --> 02:35:15,805
SHOULD SAY AND HOW HE SHOULD 

4783
02:35:15,805 --> 02:35:18,709
SAY IT AND TALKS ABOUT HOW THEY 

4784
02:35:18,709 --> 02:35:21,144
ARE HIRING 20,000 MORE PEOPLE 

4785
02:35:21,144 --> 02:35:23,514
TO HELP POLICE THE SITE AND 

4786
02:35:23,514 --> 02:35:26,216
KEEPS HARKENING BACK TO HIS 

4787
02:35:26,216 --> 02:35:27,718
HUMBLE DAYS IN A HARVARD DORM 

4788
02:35:27,718 --> 02:35:30,454
ROOM AS IF THAT WOULD WIN HIM 

4789
02:35:30,454 --> 02:35:34,625
SYMPATHY AND THIS EXCHANGE WITH 

4790
02:35:34,625 --> 02:35:36,393
SENATORS HAVE EXPOSED MANY OF 

4791
02:35:36,393 --> 02:35:39,196
THEM AS ORRIN HATCH THE SECOND 

4792
02:35:39,196 --> 02:35:40,931
OLDEST SENATOR AND THE MOST 

4793
02:35:40,931 --> 02:35:42,833
SENIOR REPUBLICAN HAD NO IDEA 

4794
02:35:42,833 --> 02:35:44,535
THAT FACEBOOK SELLS AD IS A 

4795
02:35:44,535 --> 02:35:45,268
SIGN THAT SENATOR HATCH DOES 

4796
02:35:45,268 --> 02:35:50,139
NOT CHECK UP ON THE GRANDKIDS 

4797
02:35:50,139 --> 02:35:52,943
THAT WAY AND SENATOR ROGER 

4798
02:35:52,943 --> 02:35:54,344
WICKER FROM FACEBOOK HAD TO 

4799
02:35:54,344 --> 02:35:56,346
CLARIFY WHAT HE MEANT BY PIPES 

4800
02:35:56,346 --> 02:35:57,313
OR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS 

4801
02:35:57,313 --> 02:35:58,882
AND HOW THEY PIPE IN INTERNET 

4802
02:35:58,882 --> 02:36:00,417
TO YOUR HOME. 

4803
02:36:00,417 --> 02:36:03,186
EXAMPLES THAT AND REMINDERS 

4804
02:36:03,186 --> 02:36:04,221
FRANKLY THAT IN A BODY WHERE 

4805
02:36:04,221 --> 02:36:06,723
THE AVERAGE AGE IS 61, MANY OF 

4806
02:36:06,723 --> 02:36:07,458
THE PEOPLE QUESTIONING HIM 

4807
02:36:07,458 --> 02:36:10,627
TODAY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE 

4808
02:36:10,627 --> 02:36:10,894
PROCESS. 

4809
02:36:10,894 --> 02:36:13,463
>> YOU FELL AS IF THE SENATORS 

4810
02:36:13,463 --> 02:36:14,130
WERE ASKING QUESTIONS WRITTEN 

4811
02:36:14,130 --> 02:36:17,501
FOR THEM AND MR. ZUCKERBERG WAS 

4812
02:36:17,501 --> 02:36:17,968
ABLE TO DIVERT THEM. 

4813
02:36:17,968 --> 02:36:18,802
>> PRECISELY AND DEFINITELY 

4814
02:36:18,802 --> 02:36:21,638
DOING THAT, SOME OF THE MORE 

4815
02:36:21,638 --> 02:36:22,939
SENIOR MEMBERS AND SENIOR IN 

4816
02:36:22,939 --> 02:36:24,807
TENURE AND SENIOR IN AGE IN THE 

4817
02:36:24,807 --> 02:36:27,945
SENATE AND I THINK THEY WERE 

4818
02:36:27,945 --> 02:36:28,579
FLASHING THEIR CARDS CLEARLY. 

4819
02:36:28,579 --> 02:36:30,447
>>> ED O'KEEFE THANK YOU.  

4820
02:36:30,447 --> 02:36:31,514
WE WILL TAKE YOU BACK NOW TO 

4821
02:36:31,514 --> 02:36:37,854
CAPITOL HILL WHERE FACEBOOK CEO 

4822
02:36:37,854 --> 02:36:40,223
MARK ZUCKERBERG IS TESTIFYING 

4823
02:36:40,223 --> 02:36:42,626
BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE 

4824
02:36:42,626 --> 02:36:46,430
SENATE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE AND 

4825
02:36:46,430 --> 02:36:48,832
THE SENATE COMMITTEE. 

4826
02:36:48,832 --> 02:36:52,669
>> OUR INDIVIDUAL PRINCIPALS OF 

4827
02:36:52,669 --> 02:36:54,371
THE FIRM ALSO BEEN?  

4828
02:36:54,371 --> 02:36:54,671
P-A-L-S. 

4829
02:36:54,671 --> 02:36:56,106
>> WE ARE BLOCKING THEM FROM 

4830
02:36:56,106 --> 02:37:02,512
DOING BUSINESS BUT I DON'T 

4831
02:37:02,512 --> 02:37:07,917
BELIEVE WE ARE BLOCKING 

4832
02:37:07,917 --> 02:37:08,485
PEOPLE'S PERSONAL ACCOUNTS. 

4833
02:37:08,485 --> 02:37:09,720
>> CAN ANY CUSTOMER AMEND YOUR 

4834
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:11,522
TERMS OF SERVICE OR IF THE 

4835
02:37:11,522 --> 02:37:14,157
TERMS OF SERVICE TAKE IT OR 

4836
02:37:14,157 --> 02:37:15,325
LEAVE IT PROPOSITION FOR THE 

4837
02:37:15,325 --> 02:37:15,725
AVERAGE CUSTOMER? 

4838
02:37:15,725 --> 02:37:18,228
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THE 

4839
02:37:18,228 --> 02:37:19,429
TERMS OF SERVICE ARE WHAT THEY 

4840
02:37:19,429 --> 02:37:22,866
ARE BUT THE SERVICE IS REALLY 

4841
02:37:22,866 --> 02:37:23,834
DEFINED BY PEOPLE.  

4842
02:37:23,834 --> 02:37:25,536
BECAUSE YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHAT 

4843
02:37:25,536 --> 02:37:28,906
INFORMATION YOU SHARE AND THE 

4844
02:37:28,906 --> 02:37:31,808
WHOLE SERVICE IS ABOUT WHICH 

4845
02:37:31,808 --> 02:37:32,609
FRIENDS YOU CONNECT TO. 

4846
02:37:32,609 --> 02:37:34,310
>> MY QUESTION WOULD RELATE TO 

4847
02:37:34,310 --> 02:37:34,944
SENATOR GRAHAM HELD UP THAT BIG 

4848
02:37:34,944 --> 02:37:39,015
FAT DOCUMENT IT IS EASY TO PUT 

4849
02:37:39,015 --> 02:37:40,451
A LOT OF THINGS BURIED IN A 

4850
02:37:40,451 --> 02:37:41,651
DOCUMENT THAT LATER TURN OUT TO 

4851
02:37:41,651 --> 02:37:45,055
BE OF CONSEQUENCE AND ALL I 

4852
02:37:45,055 --> 02:37:45,856
WANT TO DO IS ESTABLISH BUT 

4853
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:50,994
THAT DOCUMENT THAT SENATOR 

4854
02:37:50,994 --> 02:37:57,100
GRAHAM HELD UP, THAT IS NOT A 

4855
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:57,734
NEGOTIATE ABLE THING WITH 

4856
02:37:57,734 --> 02:37:58,635
INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS BUT FOR 

4857
02:37:58,635 --> 02:37:59,368
THEM TO USE THE SERVICE. 

4858
02:37:59,368 --> 02:38:02,472
>> IT IS ON THE TERMS OF 

4859
02:38:02,472 --> 02:38:04,474
SERVICE BUT WE OFFER A LOT OF 

4860
02:38:04,474 --> 02:38:06,877
CONTROLS SO PEOPLE CAN 

4861
02:38:06,877 --> 02:38:08,045
CONFIGURE THE EXPERIENCE OF HOW 

4862
02:38:08,045 --> 02:38:09,446
THEY WANT. 

4863
02:38:09,446 --> 02:38:12,282
>> SO LAST QUESTION ON A 

4864
02:38:12,282 --> 02:38:13,617
DIFFERENT SUBJECT HAVING TO DO 

4865
02:38:13,617 --> 02:38:15,952
WITH THE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS 

4866
02:38:15,952 --> 02:38:20,823
THAT YOU ARE UNDERTAKING FOR 

4867
02:38:20,823 --> 02:38:22,291
ENTITIES THAT ARE PUTTING UP 

4868
02:38:22,291 --> 02:38:22,992
POLITICAL CONTENT OR ISSUE AD 

4869
02:38:22,992 --> 02:38:23,259
CONTENT. 

4870
02:38:23,259 --> 02:38:26,930
YOU HAVE SAID THEY ALL HAVE TO 

4871
02:38:26,930 --> 02:38:30,133
GO THROUGH AN AUTHORIZATION  

4872
02:38:30,133 --> 02:38:31,568
PROCESS BEFORE THEY DO IT.  

4873
02:38:31,568 --> 02:38:32,803
YOU SAID YOU WILL VERIFY THE 

4874
02:38:32,803 --> 02:38:33,604
IDENTITY.  

4875
02:38:33,604 --> 02:38:36,373
HOW DO YOU LOOK BEHIND A SHELL 

4876
02:38:36,373 --> 02:38:41,845
CORPORATION AND FIND WHO  WHO 

4877
02:38:41,845 --> 02:38:42,513
IS BEHIND IT, YOUR 

4878
02:38:42,513 --> 02:38:43,546
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS.  

4879
02:38:43,546 --> 02:38:45,449
DO YOU NEED TO LOOK BEHIND 

4880
02:38:45,449 --> 02:38:46,617
SHELL CORPORATIONS TO FIND OUT 

4881
02:38:46,617 --> 02:38:49,553
WHO IS REALLY BEHIND THE 

4882
02:38:49,553 --> 02:38:50,153
CONTENT THAT IS BEING POSTED 

4883
02:38:50,153 --> 02:38:51,522
AND IF YOU MAY NEED TO LOOK 

4884
02:38:51,522 --> 02:38:53,123
BEHIND A SHELL CORPORATION, HOW 

4885
02:38:53,123 --> 02:38:55,859
WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT?  

4886
02:38:55,859 --> 02:38:57,928
HOW WILL YOU GET TO THE TRUE 

4887
02:38:57,928 --> 02:38:58,728
WHAT LAWYERS WOULD CALL 

4888
02:38:58,728 --> 02:39:03,767
BENEFICIAL OWNER OF THE SITE 

4889
02:39:03,767 --> 02:39:05,068
THAT IS PUTTING OUT THE 

4890
02:39:05,068 --> 02:39:05,502
POLITICALMATERIAL? 

4891
02:39:05,502 --> 02:39:08,405
>> SENATOR, ARE YOU REFERRING 

4892
02:39:08,405 --> 02:39:10,774
TO THE VERIFICATION OF 

4893
02:39:10,774 --> 02:39:11,241
POLITICAL ISSUE ADS? 

4894
02:39:11,241 --> 02:39:13,176
>> YES AND BEFORE THAT 

4895
02:39:13,176 --> 02:39:13,876
POLITICAL ADS, YES. 

4896
02:39:13,876 --> 02:39:15,312
>> WE WILL REQUIRE A VALID 

4897
02:39:15,312 --> 02:39:17,814
GOVERNMENT IDENTITY AND WE ARE 

4898
02:39:17,814 --> 02:39:18,749
GOING TO VERIFY THE LOCATION. 

4899
02:39:18,749 --> 02:39:22,118
SO WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT SO 

4900
02:39:22,118 --> 02:39:22,719
THAT WAY SOMEONE SITTING IN 

4901
02:39:22,719 --> 02:39:24,721
RUSSIA FOR EXAMPLE, COULD NOT 

4902
02:39:24,721 --> 02:39:26,422
SAY THAT THEY ARE IN AMERICA 

4903
02:39:26,422 --> 02:39:28,725
AND, THEREFORE, ABLE TO RUN AN 

4904
02:39:28,725 --> 02:39:29,059
ELECTION AD. 

4905
02:39:29,059 --> 02:39:31,627
>> BUT RUNNING THROUGH A 

4906
02:39:31,627 --> 02:39:32,629
CORPORATION DOMICILED IN 

4907
02:39:32,629 --> 02:39:34,464
DELAWARE, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF 

4908
02:39:34,464 --> 02:39:36,099
THEY WERE A RUSSIAN OWNER. 

4909
02:39:36,099 --> 02:39:37,099
>> SENATOR, THAT IS CORRECT. 

4910
02:39:37,099 --> 02:39:39,402
>> THANK YOU.  

4911
02:39:39,402 --> 02:39:41,004
MY TIME IS EXPIRED AND I 

4912
02:39:41,004 --> 02:39:42,005
APPRECIATE THE COURTESY FOR THE 

4913
02:39:42,005 --> 02:39:46,243
EXTRA SECONDS. 

4914
02:39:46,243 --> 02:39:47,244
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 

4915
02:39:47,244 --> 02:39:47,778
>> THANK, MR. CHAIRMAN.  

4916
02:39:47,778 --> 02:39:48,645
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A 

4917
02:39:48,645 --> 02:39:49,646
STATEMENT YOU MADE SHORTLY 

4918
02:39:49,646 --> 02:39:51,048
BEFORE THE BREAK A FEW MINUTES 

4919
02:39:51,048 --> 02:39:51,815
AGO.  

4920
02:39:51,815 --> 02:39:54,051
YOU SAID THAT THERE IS SOME 

4921
02:39:54,051 --> 02:39:54,551
CATEGORIES OF SPEECH.  

4922
02:39:54,551 --> 02:39:55,519
SOME TYPES OF CONTENT THAT 

4923
02:39:55,519 --> 02:39:56,853
FACEBOOK WOULD NEVER WANT TO 

4924
02:39:56,853 --> 02:40:02,659
HAVE ANY PART OF AND IT TAKES 

4925
02:40:02,659 --> 02:40:05,362
ACTIVE STEPS TO AVOID 

4926
02:40:05,362 --> 02:40:07,464
DISSEMINATING HATE SPEECH AND 

4927
02:40:07,464 --> 02:40:08,364
NUDITY AND RACIST SPEECH AND I 

4928
02:40:08,364 --> 02:40:10,600
ASSUME YOU ALSO MEANT TERRORIST 

4929
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:13,002
ACTS, THREATS OF PHYSICA 

4930
02:40:13,002 --> 02:40:15,105
VIOLENCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 

4931
02:40:15,105 --> 02:40:15,705
BEYOND THAT, WOULD YOU AGREE 

4932
02:40:15,705 --> 02:40:18,407
THAT FACEBOOK OUGHT NOT TO BE 

4933
02:40:18,407 --> 02:40:21,578
PUTTING ITS THUMB ON THE SCALE 

4934
02:40:21,578 --> 02:40:22,913
WITH REGARD TO THE CONTENT OF 

4935
02:40:22,913 --> 02:40:24,413
SPEECH ASSUMING IT FITS OUT OF 

4936
02:40:24,413 --> 02:40:27,517
ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES THAT IS 

4937
02:40:27,517 --> 02:40:27,818
PROHIBITED? 

4938
02:40:27,818 --> 02:40:28,852
>> SENATOR, YES.  

4939
02:40:28,852 --> 02:40:29,653
THERE ARE GENERALLY TWO 

4940
02:40:29,653 --> 02:40:31,320
CATEGORIES OF CONTENT THAT WE 

4941
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:34,157
ARE WORRIED ABOUT, ONE ARE 

4942
02:40:34,157 --> 02:40:35,358
THINGS THAT COULD CAUSE REAL 

4943
02:40:35,358 --> 02:40:37,761
WORLD HARM.  

4944
02:40:37,761 --> 02:40:38,328
SO TERRORISM CERTAINLY FITS 

4945
02:40:38,328 --> 02:40:38,695
TOWNSHIP THAT.  

4946
02:40:38,695 --> 02:40:41,297
SELF HARM FITS INTO THAT.  

4947
02:40:41,297 --> 02:40:42,232
I WOULD CONSIDER ELECTION 

4948
02:40:42,232 --> 02:40:43,000
INTERFERENCE AND THOSE ARE THE 

4949
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,836
TYPES OF THINGS THAT -- I DON'T 

4950
02:40:45,836 --> 02:40:46,370
CONSIDER THERE TO BE MUCH 

4951
02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:48,371
DISCUSSION ON WHETHER THEY ARE 

4952
02:40:48,371 --> 02:40:49,339
GOOD OR BAD TOPICS. 

4953
02:40:49,339 --> 02:40:51,675
>> AND I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT. 

4954
02:40:51,675 --> 02:40:54,478
WHAT I'M ASKING IS ONCE YOU GET 

4955
02:40:54,478 --> 02:40:55,378
BEYOND THOSE CATEGORIES OF 

4956
02:40:55,378 --> 02:40:56,946
THINGS THAT ARE PROHIBITED AND 

4957
02:40:56,946 --> 02:40:58,148
SHOULD BE, IS IT FACEBOOK'S 

4958
02:40:58,148 --> 02:40:59,750
POSITION THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE 

4959
02:40:59,750 --> 02:41:01,852
PUTTING ITS THUMB ON THE SCALE 

4960
02:41:01,852 --> 02:41:03,286
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE FAVORING 

4961
02:41:03,286 --> 02:41:05,956
OR DISFAVORING SPEECH BASED ON 

4962
02:41:05,956 --> 02:41:07,056
ITS CONTENT AND BASED ON THE 

4963
02:41:07,056 --> 02:41:07,957
VIEWPOINT OF THAT SPEECH? 

4964
02:41:07,957 --> 02:41:11,361
>> SENATOR, IN GENERAL, THAT IS 

4965
02:41:11,361 --> 02:41:11,728
OUR POSITION.  

4966
02:41:11,728 --> 02:41:13,230
WHAT WE -- ONE OF THE THINGS 

4967
02:41:13,230 --> 02:41:15,432
THAT IS IMPORTANT THOUGH THAT 

4968
02:41:15,432 --> 02:41:17,267
IN ORDER TO CREATE A SERVICE 

4969
02:41:17,267 --> 02:41:18,001
WHERE EVERYONE HAS A VOICE, WE 

4970
02:41:18,001 --> 02:41:21,071
ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

4971
02:41:21,071 --> 02:41:23,372
PEOPLE ARE NOT BULLIED OR 

4972
02:41:23,372 --> 02:41:26,108
BASICALLY INTIMIDATED OR THE 

4973
02:41:26,108 --> 02:41:26,709
ENVIRONMENT FEELS UNSAFE FOR 

4974
02:41:26,709 --> 02:41:26,909
THEM. 

4975
02:41:26,909 --> 02:41:28,078
>> OK.  

4976
02:41:28,078 --> 02:41:29,746
SO WHEN YOU SAY IN EVERYWHERE, 

4977
02:41:29,746 --> 02:41:32,181
THAT'S THE EXCEPTION THAT YOU 

4978
02:41:32,181 --> 02:41:34,050
ARE REFERRING TO, THE EXCEPTION 

4979
02:41:34,050 --> 02:41:36,652
BEING THAT IF SOMEONE FEELS 

4980
02:41:36,652 --> 02:41:39,455
BULLIED EVEN IF IT IS NOT 

4981
02:41:39,455 --> 02:41:40,056
NUDITY OR RACIST SPEECH OR 

4982
02:41:40,056 --> 02:41:42,659
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU MAY 

4983
02:41:42,659 --> 02:41:43,360
STEP IN THERE.  

4984
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:45,262
BEYOND THAT WOULD YOU PUT YOUR 

4985
02:41:45,262 --> 02:41:46,329
THUMB ON THE SCALE AS FAR AS 

4986
02:41:46,329 --> 02:41:51,268
THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CONTENT 

4987
02:41:51,268 --> 02:41:51,601
BEING POSTED? 

4988
02:41:51,601 --> 02:41:52,002
>> SENATOR, NO.  

4989
02:41:52,002 --> 02:41:53,837
IN GENERAL, OUR GOAL IS TO 

4990
02:41:53,837 --> 02:41:56,640
ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE AS MUCH 

4991
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:57,140
EXPRESSION AS POSSIBLE. 

4992
02:41:57,140 --> 02:41:57,440
>> OKAY.  

4993
02:41:57,440 --> 02:41:58,408
SO SUBJECT TO THE EXCEPTIONS 

4994
02:41:58,408 --> 02:41:59,242
THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED, YOU 

4995
02:41:59,242 --> 02:42:02,712
WOULD STAY OUT OF THAT.  

4996
02:42:02,712 --> 02:42:04,948
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, ISN'T 

4997
02:42:04,948 --> 02:42:08,185
THERE A SIGNIFICANT FREE MARKET 

4998
02:42:08,185 --> 02:42:10,153
INCENTIVE THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA 

4999
02:42:10,153 --> 02:42:11,054
COMPANY INCLUDING YOURS HAS IN 

5000
02:42:11,054 --> 02:42:15,224
ORDER TO SAVE GUARD THE DATA OF 

5001
02:42:15,224 --> 02:42:20,330
YOUR USERS?  

5002
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:22,565
DON'T YOU HAVE FREE MARKET 

5003
02:42:22,565 --> 02:42:22,865
INCENTIVES? 

5004
02:42:22,865 --> 02:42:23,099
>> YES. 

5005
02:42:23,099 --> 02:42:23,766
>> DON'T THEY ALIGN WITH THOSE 

5006
02:42:23,766 --> 02:42:28,271
OF US HERE THAT WANTS TO SEE 

5007
02:42:28,271 --> 02:42:28,671
DATA SAFEGUARDED. 

5008
02:42:28,671 --> 02:42:29,039
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

5009
02:42:29,039 --> 02:42:30,673
>> DO YOU HAVE THE 

5010
02:42:30,673 --> 02:42:31,307
TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS AVAILABLE 

5011
02:42:31,307 --> 02:42:34,478
AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO MAKE SURE 

5012
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:36,879
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND TO 

5013
02:42:36,879 --> 02:42:38,849
PROTECT, SAY, AND APP DEVELOPER 

5014
02:42:38,849 --> 02:42:44,354
FROM TRANSFERRING FACEBOOK DATA 

5015
02:42:44,354 --> 02:42:44,988
TO A 3rd PARTY? 

5016
02:42:44,988 --> 02:42:47,023
>> SENATOR A LOT OF THAT WE DO 

5017
02:42:47,023 --> 02:42:50,593
AND A LOT OF IT WILL HAPPEN 

5018
02:42:50,593 --> 02:42:54,164
OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS AND 

5019
02:42:54,164 --> 02:42:54,764
REQUIRES NEW MEASURES.  

5020
02:42:54,764 --> 02:42:56,666
FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE CHOSE TO 

5021
02:42:56,666 --> 02:42:57,967
SHARE INFORMATION WITH AN APP 

5022
02:42:57,967 --> 02:42:58,601
DEVELOPER THAT WORKED ACCORDING 

5023
02:42:58,601 --> 02:43:01,604
TO THE SYSTEM DESIGN AND IT WAS 

5024
02:43:01,604 --> 02:43:05,108
TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR SYSTEM 

5025
02:43:05,108 --> 02:43:06,308
TO SERVERS THAT THIS DEVELOPER 

5026
02:43:06,308 --> 02:43:06,942
ALEXANDER COLDGAN HAD AND THAT 

5027
02:43:06,942 --> 02:43:09,713
PERSON CHOSE TOSELL THE DATA 

5028
02:43:09,713 --> 02:43:10,247
TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA.  

5029
02:43:10,247 --> 02:43:13,550
THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE MUCH 

5030
02:43:13,550 --> 02:43:14,618
MORE ACTIVE INTERVENTION AND 

5031
02:43:14,618 --> 02:43:15,352
AUDITING TO PREVENT GOING 

5032
02:43:15,352 --> 02:43:16,486
FORWARD BECAUSE ONCE IT IS OUT 

5033
02:43:16,486 --> 02:43:18,355
OF OUR SYSTEM IT IS A LOT 

5034
02:43:18,355 --> 02:43:21,924
HARDER FOR US TO HAVE A FULL 

5035
02:43:21,924 --> 02:43:22,491
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS 

5036
02:43:22,491 --> 02:43:22,792
HAPPENING. 

5037
02:43:22,792 --> 02:43:22,958
>> 

5038
02:43:22,958 --> 02:43:24,895
>> FROM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID 

5039
02:43:24,895 --> 02:43:27,364
TODAY AND FROM PREVIOUS 

5040
02:43:27,364 --> 02:43:30,567
STATEMENTS MADE BY YOU AND 

5041
02:43:30,567 --> 02:43:31,601
OTHER OFFICIALS AT YOUR 

5042
02:43:31,601 --> 02:43:34,471
COMPANY, DATA IS AT THE CENTER 

5043
02:43:34,471 --> 02:43:36,039
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL, IT IS HOW 

5044
02:43:36,039 --> 02:43:38,307
YOU MAKE MONEY AND YOUR ABILITY 

5045
02:43:38,307 --> 02:43:40,343
TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS 

5046
02:43:40,343 --> 02:43:40,910
EFFECTIVELY EVEN THOUGH YOU 

5047
02:43:40,910 --> 02:43:48,151
DON'T CHARGE YOUR USERS IS 

5048
02:43:48,151 --> 02:43:48,952
BASED ON MONEYIZING DATA.  

5049
02:43:48,952 --> 02:43:50,653
THE REAL ISIS WHAT YOU TELL THE 

5050
02:43:50,653 --> 02:43:52,389
PUBLIC AND WHAT YOU TELL USERS 

5051
02:43:52,389 --> 02:43:53,923
ON FACEBOOK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE 

5052
02:43:53,923 --> 02:43:55,892
GOING TO DO WITH THE DATA, 

5053
02:43:55,892 --> 02:43:57,560
ABOUT HOW YOU ARE GOING TO USE 

5054
02:43:57,560 --> 02:43:57,760
IT. 

5055
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:02,231
CAN YOU GIVE ME A COUPLE OF 

5056
02:44:02,231 --> 02:44:05,334
EXAMPLES, MAYBE TWO EXAMPLES OF 

5057
02:44:05,334 --> 02:44:06,535
WAYS IN WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED 

5058
02:44:06,535 --> 02:44:10,440
BY FACEBOOK IN A WAY THAT 

5059
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:11,140
PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF? 

5060
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:15,545
TWO EXAMPLES OF TYPES OF DATA 

5061
02:44:15,545 --> 02:44:16,846
THAT FACEBOOK COLLECTS THAT 

5062
02:44:16,846 --> 02:44:18,714
MIGHT BE SURPRISING TO FACEBOOK 

5063
02:44:18,714 --> 02:44:18,948
USERS? 

5064
02:44:18,948 --> 02:44:20,984
>> WELL, SENATOR, I WILL HOPE 

5065
02:44:20,984 --> 02:44:24,287
THAT WHAT WE DO WITH DATA IS 

5066
02:44:24,287 --> 02:44:24,854
NOT SURPRISING TO PEOPLE. 

5067
02:44:24,854 --> 02:44:27,557
>> AND HAS IT BEEN AT TIMES? 

5068
02:44:27,557 --> 02:44:30,026
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK IN 

5069
02:44:30,026 --> 02:44:30,594
THIS CASE PEOPLE CERTAINLY 

5070
02:44:30,594 --> 02:44:32,728
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS DEVELOPER TO 

5071
02:44:32,728 --> 02:44:34,230
SELL THE DATA TO CAMBRIDGE 

5072
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:38,201
ANALYTICA.  

5073
02:44:38,201 --> 02:44:39,703
IN GENERAL THERE ARE TWO TYPES 

5074
02:44:39,703 --> 02:44:41,203
OF DATA THAT FACEBOOK HAS, THE 

5075
02:44:41,203 --> 02:44:43,606
VAST MAJORITY AND THE FIRST 

5076
02:44:43,606 --> 02:44:44,240
CATEGORY IS CONTENT THAT PEOPLE 

5077
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,976
CHOSE TO SHARE ON THE SERVICE 

5078
02:44:45,976 --> 02:44:46,309
THEMSELVES.  

5079
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:48,178
SO THAT IS ALL OF THE PHOTOS 

5080
02:44:48,178 --> 02:44:50,347
THAT YOU SHARE, THE POSTS THAT 

5081
02:44:50,347 --> 02:44:52,548
YOU MAKE, WHAT YOU THINK OF AS 

5082
02:44:52,548 --> 02:44:53,216
THE FACEBOOK SERVICE.  

5083
02:44:53,216 --> 02:44:54,985
THAT IS -- EVERYONE HAS CONTROL 

5084
02:44:54,985 --> 02:44:56,952
EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT THEY GO 

5085
02:44:56,952 --> 02:44:58,288
TO SHARE THAT AND THEY COULD 

5086
02:44:58,288 --> 02:45:00,256
DELETE IT ANYTIME THEY WANT, 

5087
02:45:00,256 --> 02:45:02,092
FULL CONTROL THE MAJORITY OF 

5088
02:45:02,092 --> 02:45:02,525
THE DATA.  

5089
02:45:02,525 --> 02:45:04,194
THE SECOND CATEGORY IS AROUND 

5090
02:45:04,194 --> 02:45:06,763
SPECIFIC DATA THAT WE COLLECT 

5091
02:45:06,763 --> 02:45:08,964
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE 

5092
02:45:08,964 --> 02:45:09,598
ADVERTISING EXPERIENCES BETTER 

5093
02:45:09,598 --> 02:45:12,068
AND MORRELL VAN AND WORK FOR 

5094
02:45:12,068 --> 02:45:13,169
BUSINESSES AND THOSE OFTEN 

5095
02:45:13,169 --> 02:45:15,571
REVOLVE AROUND MEASURING IF WE 

5096
02:45:15,571 --> 02:45:17,540
SHOWED YOU AN AD THEN YOU CLICK 

5097
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:18,341
THROUGH AND YOU GO SOMEWHERE 

5098
02:45:18,341 --> 02:45:23,546
ELSE WE CAN MEASURE THAT YOU 

5099
02:45:23,546 --> 02:45:25,548
ACTUALLY, THAT THE AD WORKS AND 

5100
02:45:25,548 --> 02:45:26,716
THAT MAKES IT RELEVANT FOR THE 

5101
02:45:26,716 --> 02:45:29,785
PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE ADS AND 

5102
02:45:29,785 --> 02:45:30,386
THE BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY 

5103
02:45:30,386 --> 02:45:31,588
PERFORM BETTER AND YOU HAVE 

5104
02:45:31,588 --> 02:45:33,723
CONTROL OF THE SECOND DATA.  

5105
02:45:33,723 --> 02:45:38,762
YOU CAN TURN OFF THE ABILITY 

5106
02:45:38,762 --> 02:45:39,763
FOR FACEBOOK TO COLLECT THAT.  

5107
02:45:39,763 --> 02:45:44,400
ADS WILL GET WORSE SO PEOPLE 

5108
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:45,969
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. 

5109
02:45:45,969 --> 02:45:46,735
>> SENATOR. 

5110
02:45:46,735 --> 02:45:48,004

OF SERVICE.  

5113
02:45:52,275 --> 02:45:58,148
THEY ARE ABOUT 3200 WORDS WITH 

5114
02:45:58,148 --> 02:45:59,915
32 LINKS AND ONE OF THE LINKS 

5115
02:45:59,915 --> 02:46:01,117
IS TO THE DATA POLICY AND 

5116
02:46:01,117 --> 02:46:04,453
PEOPLE HAVE NO EARTHLY IDEA 

5117
02:46:04,453 --> 02:46:05,354
WHAT THEY ARE SIGNING UP FOR 

5118
02:46:05,354 --> 02:46:07,356
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE 

5119
02:46:07,356 --> 02:46:09,025
PRESENT TIME THIS IS A LEGALLY 

5120
02:46:09,025 --> 02:46:10,760
BINDING BUT I AM WANDERING IF 

5121
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:12,529
YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THE BILLIONS 

5122
02:46:12,529 --> 02:46:14,531
OF USERS IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, 

5123
02:46:14,531 --> 02:46:16,966
WHAT ARE THEY SIGNING UP FOR? 

5124

IN GENERAL, YOU SIGN UP FOR THE

THE INFORMATION YOU WANT WITH 

5130
02:46:27,109 --> 02:46:27,877
PEOPLE.  

5131
02:46:27,877 --> 02:46:29,145
THAT'S WHAT THE SERVICE IS, 

5132
02:46:29,145 --> 02:46:29,845
THAT YOU CAN CONNECT WITH THE 

5133
02:46:29,845 --> 02:46:33,750
PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT AND YOU

YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH AND YOU 

5139
02:46:42,692 --> 02:46:46,962
CAN TAKE IT DOWN IF YOU DON'T

5142
02:46:48,264 --> 02:46:53,736
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT, NOT 

5143
02:46:53,736 --> 02:46:55,138
THE FUN PART.

WORRIED ABOUT THAT THE DATA

EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN 

5154
02:47:10,653 --> 02:47:11,453
YOU CLICK LIKE ON SOMETHING OR 

5155
02:47:11,453 --> 02:47:15,258

EXACTLY BECAUSE BOTH AS A

TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE

ARE YOU DOING WITH THE DATA AND

CONTROL OVER THE DATA.  

5212

02:49:06,769 --> 02:49:09,372
AS A LEGAL MATTER THAT I OWN MY

PRINCIPLE AND ASPIRATIONAL GOAL 

5219

WE OWN OUR OWN DATA, OTHERWISE 

5221
02:49:23,319 --> 02:49:26,089

5245
02:50:06,295 --> 02:50:07,296
NEED TO DELETE THE WHOLE

5247
02:50:07,930 --> 02:50:09,665
YOU HAVE CONTROL AND YOU CAN

02:50:20,710 --> 02:50:25,381
PROPOSES A CONCEPT OF 

5256
02:50:25,381 --> 02:50:27,216
INFORMATION FIDUCIARY THAT IS 

5257
02:50:27,216 --> 02:50:27,817
RESPONSIBLE IN THE ECONOMIC 

5258
02:50:27,817 --> 02:50:29,652
ACCEPTS BUT THIS IS A 

5259
02:50:29,652 --> 02:50:31,521
RELATIONSHIP LIKE DOCTORS AND 

5260
02:50:31,521 --> 02:50:32,455
LAWYERS, TECH COMPANIES SHOULD 

5261
02:50:32,455 --> 02:50:35,024
HOL IN TRUST OUR PERSONAL DATA. 

5262
02:50:35,024 --> 02:50:41,631
ARE YOU OPEN TO THE IDEA OF 

5263
02:50:41,631 --> 02:50:42,131
INFORMATION FIDUCIARY. 

5264
02:50:42,131 --> 02:50:43,699
>>I THINK IT IS AN INTERESTING 

5265
02:50:43,699 --> 02:50:45,200
IDEA AND JACK IS THOUGHTFUL IN 

5266
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:53,609
THE SPACE SO I DO THINK IT 

5267
02:50:53,609 --> 02:50:55,278
DESERVES CONSIDERATION. 

5268
02:50:55,278 --> 02:50:55,711
>> THANK YOU. 

5269
02:50:55,711 --> 02:50:57,814
>> THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG 

5270
02:50:57,814 --> 02:50:59,548
FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND MR. 

5271
02:50:59,548 --> 02:51:00,416
CHAIRMAN.  

5272
02:51:00,416 --> 02:51:04,487
THE FULL SCOPE OF FACEBOOK 

5273
02:51:04,487 --> 02:51:06,889
USERS ACTIVITY CAN PRINT VERY 

5274
02:51:06,889 --> 02:51:08,624
PERSONAL PICTURE I THINK AND 

5275
02:51:08,624 --> 02:51:10,526
ADDITIONALLY YOU HAVE THOSE TWO 

5276
02:51:10,526 --> 02:51:11,660
BILLION USERS THAT ARE OUT 

5277
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:13,629
THERE EVERY MONTH AND SO WE ALL 

5278
02:51:13,629 --> 02:51:16,465
KNOW THAT IS LARGER THAN THE 

5279
02:51:16,465 --> 02:51:21,036
POPULATION OF MOST COUNTRIES SO 

5280
02:51:21,036 --> 02:51:22,771
HOW MANY DATA CATEGORIES DO YOU 

5281
02:51:22,771 --> 02:51:26,909
STORE, DOES FACEBOOK STORE ON 

5282
02:51:26,909 --> 02:51:27,743
THE CATEGORIES THAT YOU 

5283
02:51:27,743 --> 02:51:28,010
COLLECT? 

5284
02:51:28,010 --> 02:51:28,944
>> SENATOR, CAN YOU CLARIFY 

5285
02:51:28,944 --> 02:51:30,112
WHAT YOU MEAN BY DATA 

5286
02:51:30,112 --> 02:51:30,412
CATEGORIES? 

5287
02:51:30,412 --> 02:51:32,781
>> THERE IS SOME PAST REPORTS 

5288
02:51:32,781 --> 02:51:36,219
THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT 

5289
02:51:36,219 --> 02:51:38,421
INDICATE THAT FACEBOOK COLLECTS 

5290
02:51:38,421 --> 02:51:41,924
ABOUT 96 DATA CATEGORIES FOR 

5291
02:51:41,924 --> 02:51:43,526
THOSE TWO BILLION ACTIVE USERS. 

5292
02:51:43,526 --> 02:51:45,027
THAT'S 192 BILLION DATA POINTS 

5293
02:51:45,027 --> 02:51:48,931
THAT ARE BEING GENERATED, I 

5294
02:51:48,931 --> 02:51:50,433
THINK AT ANY TIME FROM 

5295
02:51:50,433 --> 02:51:51,134
CONSUMERS GLOBALLY. 

5296
02:51:51,134 --> 02:51:52,901
SO HOW MANY DO YOU -- DOES 

5297
02:51:52,901 --> 02:51:56,105
FACEBOOK STORE OUT OF THAT?  

5298
02:51:56,105 --> 02:51:56,538
DO YOU STORE ANY? 

5299
02:51:56,538 --> 02:52:01,977
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT ACTUALLY 

5300
02:52:01,977 --> 02:52:04,079
SURE WHAT THAT IS REFERRING TO. 

5301
02:52:04,079 --> 02:52:08,684
>> ON THE POINTS THAT YOU 

5302
02:52:08,684 --> 02:52:11,020
COLLECT INFORMATION, IF WE CALL 

5303
02:52:11,020 --> 02:52:11,721
THOSE CATEGORIES.  

5304
02:52:11,721 --> 02:52:18,327
HOW MANY DO YOU STORE OF 

5305
02:52:18,327 --> 02:52:18,860
INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE 

5306
02:52:18,860 --> 02:52:19,161
COLLECTING? 

5307
02:52:19,161 --> 02:52:21,230
>> SENATOR, THE WAY THAT I 

5308
02:52:21,230 --> 02:52:25,234
THINK ABOUT THIS, IS THAT THERE 

5309
02:52:25,234 --> 02:52:26,935
ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES.  

5310
02:52:26,935 --> 02:52:27,603
THIS DOESN'T LINE UP WITH WHAT 

5311
02:52:27,603 --> 02:52:28,704
THE SPECIFIC REPORT THAT YOU 

5312
02:52:28,704 --> 02:52:30,206
WERE SAYING, I CAN MAKE SURE 

5313
02:52:30,206 --> 02:52:31,107
THAT WE FOLLOW UP WITH YOU 

5314
02:52:31,107 --> 02:52:33,943
AFTERWARDS TO GET YOU THE 

5315
02:52:33,943 --> 02:52:34,710
INFORMATION YOU NEED.  

5316
02:52:34,710 --> 02:52:37,814
THE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES THAT I 

5317
02:52:37,814 --> 02:52:39,648
THINK ABOUT ARE CONTENT THAT A 

5318
02:52:39,648 --> 02:52:41,817
PERSON HAS CHOSEN TO SHARE AND 

5319
02:52:41,817 --> 02:52:42,618
THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER IT, AND 

5320
02:52:42,618 --> 02:52:44,120
WHEN THEY PUT IT ON AND TAKE IT 

5321
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:46,556
DOWN AND WHO SEES IT AND THE 

5322
02:52:46,556 --> 02:52:49,525
OTHER CATEGORY ARE DATA THAT 

5323
02:52:49,525 --> 02:52:51,627
ARE CONNECTED TO MAKING THE ADS 

5324
02:52:51,627 --> 02:52:51,928
RELEVANT.  

5325
02:52:51,928 --> 02:52:52,728
YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER 

5326
02:52:52,728 --> 02:52:55,297
BOTH AND YOU CAN TURN OFF THE 

5327
02:52:55,297 --> 02:52:56,532
DATA RELATED TO ADS AND CHOOSE 

5328
02:52:56,532 --> 02:52:58,134
NOT TO SHARE ANY CONTENT OR 

5329
02:52:58,134 --> 02:52:59,535
CONTROL EXACTLY WHO SEES IT OR 

5330
02:52:59,535 --> 02:53:02,405
TAKES DOWN THE CONTENT IN THE 

5331
02:53:02,405 --> 02:53:02,805
FORMER CATEGORY. 

5332
02:53:02,805 --> 02:53:10,947
>> DOES FACEBOOK STORE ANY OF 

5333
02:53:10,947 --> 02:53:11,213
THAT IF. 

5334
02:53:11,213 --> 02:53:11,480
>> YES. 

5335
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:13,482
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU STORE OF 

5336
02:53:13,482 --> 02:53:15,117
THAT, EVERYTHING?  

5337
02:53:15,117 --> 02:53:17,119
IS THAT IN STORAGE SOMEWHERE? 

5338
02:53:17,119 --> 02:53:19,422
>> SENATOR, WE STORE DATA ABOUT 

5339
02:53:19,422 --> 02:53:22,057
WHAT PEOPLE SHARE ON THE 

5340
02:53:22,057 --> 02:53:22,825
SERVICE AND INFORMATION THAT IS 

5341
02:53:22,825 --> 02:53:24,427
REQUIRED TO DO RANKING BETTER 

5342
02:53:24,427 --> 02:53:29,832
AND SHOW YOU WHAT YOU CARE 

5343
02:53:29,832 --> 02:53:32,435
ABOUT IN NEWS FEED. 

5344
02:53:32,435 --> 02:53:37,472
>> DO YOU STORE TEXT, HISTORY, 

5345
02:53:37,472 --> 02:53:39,041
MUSIC CONTENT, ACTIVITY, DEVICE 

5346
02:53:39,041 --> 02:53:39,308
LOCATION? 

5347
02:53:39,308 --> 02:53:45,014
>> SENATOR, SOME OF THAT 

5348
02:53:45,014 --> 02:53:46,515
CONTENT WITH PEOPLE'S 

5349
02:53:46,515 --> 02:53:47,016
PERMISSION WE DO STORE. 

5350
02:53:47,016 --> 02:53:54,389
>> DO YOU DISCLOSE ANY OF THAT? 

5351
02:53:54,389 --> 02:53:55,825
>> YES.  

5352
02:53:55,825 --> 02:53:56,726
IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE 

5353
02:53:56,726 --> 02:53:57,626
THAT INFORMATION WITH FACEBOOK, 

5354
02:53:57,626 --> 02:54:02,365
I BELIEVE THAT ALMOST 

5355
02:54:02,365 --> 02:54:04,800
EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST SAID 

5356
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:05,134
WOULD BE ... 

5357
02:54:05,134 --> 02:54:07,003
>> IN THE PRIVACY SETTINGS IT 

5358
02:54:07,003 --> 02:54:09,105
IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY 

5359
02:54:09,105 --> 02:54:13,142
LIM THE SHARING WITH OTHER 

5360
02:54:13,142 --> 02:54:13,676
FACEBOOK USERS, IS THAT 

5361
02:54:13,676 --> 02:54:13,943
CORRECT? 

5362
02:54:13,943 --> 02:54:15,077
>> YES, EVERY PERSON GETS TO 

5363
02:54:15,077 --> 02:54:17,813
CONTROL WHO GETS TO SEE THEIR 

5364
02:54:17,813 --> 02:54:18,147
CONTENT. 

5365
02:54:18,147 --> 02:54:19,514
>> AND DOES THAT LIMIT THE 

5366
02:54:19,514 --> 02:54:24,720
ABILITY FOR FACEBOOK TO COLLECT 

5367
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:25,087
AND USE IT? 

5368
02:54:25,087 --> 02:54:27,323
>> SENATOR, YES, THERE ARE 

5369
02:54:27,323 --> 02:54:30,525
OTHER CONTROLS THAT DETERMINE 

5370
02:54:30,525 --> 02:54:31,126
WHAT FACEBOOK CAN DO AS WELL. 

5371
02:54:31,126 --> 02:54:34,931
SO FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE HAVE 

5372
02:54:34,931 --> 02:54:36,532
CONTROL ABOUT FACE RECOGNITION. 

5373
02:54:36,532 --> 02:54:37,533
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT US TO HELP 

5374
02:54:37,533 --> 02:54:39,568
IDENTIFY WHEN THEY ARE IN 

5375
02:54:39,568 --> 02:54:41,003
PHOTOS THAT THEIR FRIENDS 

5376
02:54:41,003 --> 02:54:41,870
UPLOAD, THEY CAN TURN THAT OFF 

5377
02:54:41,870 --> 02:54:46,175
AND WE WON'T STORE THAT KIND OF 

5378
02:54:46,175 --> 02:54:46,608
TEMPLATE FOR THEM. 

5379
02:54:46,608 --> 02:54:53,949
>> AND THERE WAS SOME ACTION 

5380
02:54:53,949 --> 02:54:56,052
WROTE A FACEBOOK POST AT THE -

5381
02:54:56,052 --> 02:54:58,087
TIME ON A PUBLIC PAGE ON THE 

5382
02:54:58,087 --> 02:54:59,054
INTERNET THAT IT USED TO SEEM 

5383
02:54:59,054 --> 02:55:01,590
SCARY TO PEOPLE BUT AS LONG AS 

5384
02:55:01,590 --> 02:55:03,826
THEY COULD MAKE THEIR PAGE 

5385
02:55:03,826 --> 02:55:05,761
PRIVATE, THEY FELT SAFE SHARING 

5386
02:55:05,761 --> 02:55:07,563
WITH THEIR FRIENDS ON LINE. 

5387
02:55:07,563 --> 02:55:12,301
CONTROL WAS KEY.  

5388
02:55:12,301 --> 02:55:13,102
AND YOU JUST MENTIONED CONTROL. 

5389
02:55:13,102 --> 02:55:15,504
SENATOR HATCH ASKED YOU A 

5390
02:55:15,504 --> 02:55:17,873
QUESTION AND YOU RESPONDED 

5391
02:55:17,873 --> 02:55:18,541
THERE ABOUT COMPLETE CONTROL.  

5392
02:55:18,541 --> 02:55:22,010
SO YOU AND YOUR COMPANY HAVE 

5393
02:55:22,010 --> 02:55:24,246
USED THAT TERM REPEATEDLY AND I 

5394
02:55:24,246 --> 02:55:26,916
BELIEVE THAT YOU USE IT TO 

5395
02:55:26,916 --> 02:55:28,317
REASSURE USERS, IS THAT 

5396
02:55:28,317 --> 02:55:28,884
CORRECT?  

5397
02:55:28,884 --> 02:55:32,455
THAT YOU DO HAVE CONTROL AND 

5398
02:55:32,455 --> 02:55:34,557
COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE 

5399
02:55:34,557 --> 02:55:34,890
INFORMATION? 

5400
02:55:34,890 --> 02:55:37,126
>> WELL, SENATOR, THIS IS HOW 

5401
02:55:37,126 --> 02:55:37,593
THE SERVICE WORKS.  

5402
02:55:37,593 --> 02:55:41,230
THE CORE THING THAT FACEBOOK IS 

5403
02:55:41,230 --> 02:55:42,865
AND ALL OF OUR SERVICES, WHAT'S 

5404
02:55:42,865 --> 02:55:45,234
UP, INSTAGRAM AND MESSENGER. 

5405
02:55:45,234 --> 02:55:48,670
>> THIS IS A QUESTION OF 

5406
02:55:48,670 --> 02:55:52,842
FACEBOOK IS ABOUT FEELING SAFE 

5407
02:55:52,842 --> 02:55:55,845
OR ARE USERS ACTUALLY SAFE?  

5408
02:55:55,845 --> 02:55:56,445
IS FACEBOOK BEING SAFE? 

5409
02:55:56,445 --> 02:55:58,013
>> SENATOR, I THINK FACEBOOK IS 

5410
02:55:58,013 --> 02:55:58,347
SAFE.  

5411
02:55:58,347 --> 02:55:59,715
I USE IT AND MY FAMILY USE IT 

5412
02:55:59,715 --> 02:56:01,050
AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE I LOVE 

5413
02:56:01,050 --> 02:56:04,020
AND CARE ABOUT IT USE IT ALL 

5414
02:56:04,020 --> 02:56:06,455
THE TIME.  

5415
02:56:06,455 --> 02:56:07,456
THESE CONTROLS ARE NOT JUST TO 

5416
02:56:07,456 --> 02:56:08,724
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE IT IS 

5417
02:56:08,724 --> 02:56:10,159
WHAT PEOPLE WANT IN THE 

5418
02:56:10,159 --> 02:56:10,860
PRODUCT.  

5419
02:56:10,860 --> 02:56:12,995
THE REALITY IS -- JUST THINK 

5420
02:56:12,995 --> 02:56:14,830
ABOUT HOW YOU USE IT YOURSELF, 

5421
02:56:14,830 --> 02:56:17,099
YOU TAKE A PHOTO, YOU ARE NOT 

5422
02:56:17,099 --> 02:56:17,733
ALWAYS GOING TO SEND THAT TO 

5423
02:56:17,733 --> 02:56:19,134
THE SAME PEOPLE.  

5424
02:56:19,134 --> 02:56:20,870
YOU MAY WANT TO TEXT IT TO ONE 

5425
02:56:20,870 --> 02:56:22,204
PERSON OR TO A GROUP THAT YOU 

5426
02:56:22,204 --> 02:56:23,339
HAVE A PAGE.  

5427
02:56:23,339 --> 02:56:26,242
YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO PUT 

5428
02:56:26,242 --> 02:56:28,110
SOME STUFF OUT THERE PUBLICLY 

5429
02:56:28,110 --> 02:56:29,412
TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR 

5430
02:56:29,412 --> 02:56:29,779
CONSTITUENTS.  

5431
02:56:29,779 --> 02:56:30,812
THERE ARE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF 

5432
02:56:30,812 --> 02:56:33,449
PEOPLE THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO 

5433
02:56:33,449 --> 02:56:34,750
CONNECT WITH AND THOSE CONTROLS 

5434
02:56:34,750 --> 02:56:36,252
ARE IMPORTANT AND IN PRACTICE 

5435
02:56:36,252 --> 02:56:38,454
OF OPERATION OF THE SERVICE NOT 

5436
02:56:38,454 --> 02:56:39,755
TO JUST BUILD TRUST BY 

5437
02:56:39,755 --> 02:56:40,622
PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH CONTROL 

5438
02:56:40,622 --> 02:56:42,658
DOES THAT BUT ACTUALLY IN ORDER 

5439
02:56:42,658 --> 02:56:44,960
TO MAKE IT SO PEOPLE CAN 

5440
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:49,431
FULFILL THEIR GOALS WITH THE 

5441
02:56:49,431 --> 02:56:49,698
SERVICE. 

5442
02:56:49,698 --> 02:56:50,899
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN AND MR. 

5443
02:56:50,899 --> 02:56:51,500
ZUCKERBERG FOR JOINING US.  

5444
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:53,802
I THINK THE WHOLE REASON IS 

5445
02:56:53,802 --> 02:56:55,838
BECAUSE OF A TENSION BETWEEN 

5446
02:56:55,838 --> 02:56:56,605
TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES.  

5447
02:56:56,605 --> 02:56:58,107
YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT THE DATA 

5448
02:56:58,107 --> 02:56:59,008
THAT PEOPLE POST ON FACEBOOK 

5449
02:56:59,008 --> 02:57:01,043
YOU CONTROL AND OWN THE DATA 

5450
02:57:01,043 --> 02:57:07,550
THAT YOU PUT ON FACEBOOK.  

5451
02:57:07,550 --> 02:57:08,150
YOU HAVE SAID SOME VERY 

5452
02:57:08,150 --> 02:57:11,186
POSITIVE OPTIMISTIC THINGS 

5453
02:57:11,186 --> 02:57:15,758
ABOUT FACEBOOK BUT IT IS A FOR 

5454
02:57:15,758 --> 02:57:17,326
PROFIT ENTITY THAT GENERATED $4 

5455
02:57:17,326 --> 02:57:18,260
BILLION IN AD REVENUES AND 

5456
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:19,061
FACEBOOK CLAIMS THAT 

5457
02:57:19,061 --> 02:57:20,162
ADVERTISING MAKES IT EASY TO 

5458
02:57:20,162 --> 02:57:21,263
FIND THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND 

5459
02:57:21,263 --> 02:57:22,665
CAPTURE ATTENTION AND GET 

5460
02:57:22,665 --> 02:57:26,535
RESULTS AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT 

5461
02:57:26,535 --> 02:57:28,304
AN AD SUPPORTED SERVICE IS BEST 

5462
02:57:28,304 --> 02:57:30,339
IN LINE WITH YOUR MISSION AND 

5463
02:57:30,339 --> 02:57:31,440
VALUES BUT THE REALITY IS THAT 

5464
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:32,942
THERE ARE EXAMPLES WHERE AD 

5465
02:57:32,942 --> 02:57:34,376
TARGETING HAS LED TO RESULTS 

5466
02:57:34,376 --> 02:57:37,780
THAT WE WOULD ALL DISAGREE WITH 

5467
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:40,883
OR DISLIKE OR WOULD CONCERN US. 

5468
02:57:40,883 --> 02:57:42,952
YOU HAVE ALREADY ADMITTED THAT 

5469
02:57:42,952 --> 02:57:46,588
FACEBOOK'S OWN AD TOOLS ALLOWED 

5470
02:57:46,588 --> 02:57:49,624
RUSSIANS TO TARGET VOTERS BASED 

5471
02:57:49,624 --> 02:57:53,728
ON RACE OR VIEWS AND THAT MAY 

5472
02:57:53,728 --> 02:57:56,065
HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE 

5473
02:57:56,065 --> 02:57:58,768
UNITED STATES.  

5474
02:57:58,768 --> 02:57:59,468
TIME LIFE MAGAZINE SAYS THERE 

5475
02:57:59,468 --> 02:58:03,639
ARE FACEBOOK TOOLS TO TIES 

5476
02:58:03,639 --> 02:58:05,140
SALES OF PROTECTED ANIMAL PARTS 

5477
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:06,608
AND I AM QUESTIONING WHETHER 

5478
02:58:06,608 --> 02:58:08,811
THE TOOLS WOULD ALLOW OTHER 

5479
02:58:08,811 --> 02:58:16,418
CONCERNING QUESTIONS LIKE DIET 

5480
02:58:16,418 --> 02:58:20,789
PILL MANUFACTURERS TARGETING 

5481
02:58:20,789 --> 02:58:23,659
TEENAGERRING STRUGGLING WITH 

5482
02:58:23,659 --> 02:58:24,193
THEIR WEIGHT OR GAMBLING 

5483
02:58:24,193 --> 02:58:24,493
PROBLEMS.  

5484
02:58:24,493 --> 02:58:26,896
PRO PUBLICCA BACK IN 2016 

5485
02:58:26,896 --> 02:58:29,431
HIGHLIGHT THE THAT FACEBOOK 

5486
02:58:29,431 --> 02:58:30,065
LETS ADVERTISERS EXCLUDE USERS 

5487
02:58:30,065 --> 02:58:30,332
BY RACE.  

5488
02:58:30,332 --> 02:58:30,933
IN REAL ESTATE ADVERTISING.  

5489
02:58:30,933 --> 02:58:36,839
THERE WAS A WAY THAT YOU COULD 

5490
02:58:36,839 --> 02:58:37,439
SAY THAT THIS PARTICULAR AD I 

5491
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:38,874
WANT WANT TO BE SEEN BY WHITE 

5492
02:58:38,874 --> 02:58:39,775
FOLKS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND 

5493
02:58:39,775 --> 02:58:41,076
THAT VIOLATES CLEAR HOUSING LAW 

5494
02:58:41,076 --> 02:58:43,111
AND OUR BASIC SENSE OF FAIRNESS 

5495
02:58:43,111 --> 02:58:44,880
IN THE UNITED STATES AND YOU 

5496
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,982
PROMPTLY ANNOUNCED THAT WAS A 

5497
02:58:46,982 --> 02:58:48,284
BAD IDEA AND YOU WOULD CHANGE 

5498
02:58:48,284 --> 02:58:54,156
THE TOOLS AND BUILD A NEW 

5499
02:58:54,156 --> 02:58:56,525
SYSTEM TO SPOT DISCRIMINATORY 

5500
02:58:56,525 --> 02:58:58,660
ADS AND A YEAR LATER THOSE 

5501
02:58:58,660 --> 02:59:01,797
CHANGES HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND 

5502
02:59:01,797 --> 02:59:02,397
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO TARGET THE 

5503
02:59:02,397 --> 02:59:05,568
HOUSING TIME IN A WAY THAT WAS 

5504
02:59:05,568 --> 02:59:06,101
RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY.  

5505
02:59:06,101 --> 02:59:09,338
MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS 

5506
02:59:09,338 --> 02:59:10,139
PRACTICE OF MAKING BOLD AND 

5507
02:59:10,139 --> 02:59:11,240
ENGAGING PROMISES ABOUT CHANGES 

5508
02:59:11,240 --> 02:59:13,075
IN PRACTICES AND THE REALITY OF 

5509
02:59:13,075 --> 02:59:17,680
HOW FACEBOOK HAS OPERATED IN 

5510
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:18,447
THE REAL WORLD ARE IN 

5511
02:59:18,447 --> 02:59:38,134
PERSISTENT TENSION.  

5512
02:59:52,681 --> 02:59:54,550
>> I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND 

5513
02:59:54,550 --> 02:59:55,951
WAS NOTIFIED BY A WHOLE GROUP 

5514
02:59:55,951 --> 02:59:57,253
OF FRIENDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 

5515
02:59:57,253 --> 02:59:59,455
ASKING IF I HAD A NEW FAMILY OR 

5516
02:59:59,455 --> 03:00:02,758
IF THERE WAS A FAKE FACEBOOK 

5517
03:00:02,758 --> 03:00:03,758
POST OF CHRIS COONS. 

5518
03:00:03,758 --> 03:00:04,960
I WENT TO THE ONE THEY 

5519
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:06,428
SUGGESTED THAT HAD A DIFFERENT 

5520
03:00:06,428 --> 03:00:07,363
MIDDLE INITIAL THAN MINE AND 

5521
03:00:07,363 --> 03:00:08,964
THERE WAS MY PICTURE WITH 

5522
03:00:08,964 --> 03:00:10,266
SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN'S FAMILY, 

5523
03:00:10,266 --> 03:00:11,867
SAME SCHOOLS I WENT TO BUT A 

5524
03:00:11,867 --> 03:00:13,535
WHOLE LOT OF RUSSIAN FRIENDS. 

5525
03:00:13,535 --> 03:00:15,137
DAN SULLIVAN HAS GOT A VERY 

5526
03:00:15,137 --> 03:00:16,505
ATTRACTIVE FAMILY, BY THE WAY. 

5527
03:00:16,505 --> 03:00:17,673
>> KEEP THAT FOR THE RECORD, 

5528
03:00:17,673 --> 03:00:19,975
MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5529
03:00:23,545 --> 03:00:26,548
>> THE FRIENDS WHO BROUGHT THAT 

5530
03:00:26,548 --> 03:00:27,750
TO MY ATTENTION INCLUDE PEOPLE 

5531
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:29,652
I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL WITH IN 

5532
03:00:29,652 --> 03:00:31,854
HAWAII AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

5533
03:00:31,854 --> 03:00:33,388
IN DELAWARE. 

5534
03:00:33,388 --> 03:00:34,756
I BROUGHT IT TO FACEBOOK'S 

5535
03:00:34,756 --> 03:00:36,258
ATTENTION AND IT WAS TAKEN DOWN 

5536
03:00:36,258 --> 03:00:38,127
BY MIDDAY, BUT I'M LEFT WORRIED 

5537
03:00:38,127 --> 03:00:40,162
BY WHAT HAPPENS TO DELAWAREANS 

5538
03:00:40,162 --> 03:00:42,064
WHO DON'T HAVE THESE RESOURCES. 

5539
03:00:42,064 --> 03:00:44,566
IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO FIND 

5540
03:00:44,566 --> 03:00:46,835
RUSSIAN TROLLS OPERATING IN THE 

5541
03:00:46,835 --> 03:00:47,102
PLATFORM. 

5542
03:00:47,102 --> 03:00:48,204
HATE GROUPS THRIVE IN SOME 

5543
03:00:48,204 --> 03:00:50,005
AREAS OF FACEBOOK EVEN THOUGH 

5544
03:00:50,005 --> 03:00:51,407
YOUR POLICIES PROHIBIT HATE 

5545
03:00:51,407 --> 03:00:54,076
SPEECH AND YOU'VE TAKEN STRONG 

5546
03:00:54,076 --> 03:00:57,746
STEPS AGAINST EXTREMISM, BUT 

5547
03:00:57,746 --> 03:00:59,148
ARE THE DELAWAREANS NOT IN THE 

5548
03:00:59,148 --> 03:01:03,185
SENATE GOING TO GET THE SAME 

5549
03:01:03,185 --> 03:01:03,818
QUICK RESPONSE? 

5550
03:01:03,818 --> 03:01:04,954
I'VE GOTTEN INFORMATION FROM 

5551
03:01:04,954 --> 03:01:06,055
FRIENDS SAYING THEY'VE HAD 

5552
03:01:06,055 --> 03:01:07,923
TROUBLE GETTING A RESPONSE WHEN 

5553
03:01:07,923 --> 03:01:11,493
THEY'VE FOUND A FACEBOOK PAGE 

5554
03:01:11,493 --> 03:01:13,362
CLEARLY VIOLATING THEIR 

5555
03:01:13,362 --> 03:01:13,862
PRINCIPLES. 

5556
03:01:13,862 --> 03:01:15,631
MY CORE QUESTION IS ISN'T IT 

5557
03:01:15,631 --> 03:01:18,534
FACEBOOK'S JOB TO PROTECT USERS 

5558
03:01:18,534 --> 03:01:20,536
AND WHY DO YOU PUSH THE BURDEN 

5559
03:01:20,536 --> 03:01:21,636
TO USERS TO FLAG INAPPROPRIATE 

5560
03:01:21,636 --> 03:01:23,305
CONTENT AND BE SURE IT'S TAKEN 

5561
03:01:23,305 --> 03:01:23,505
DOWN? 

5562
03:01:23,505 --> 03:01:25,341
>> NOR, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 

5563
03:01:25,341 --> 03:01:27,476
-- SENATOR, THERE ARE A NUMBER 

5564
03:01:27,476 --> 03:01:28,844
OF IMPORTANT POINTS IN THERE 

5565
03:01:28,844 --> 03:01:29,745
AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT 

5566
03:01:29,745 --> 03:01:32,348
THIS IS AN AREA WE NEED TO DO A 

5567
03:01:32,348 --> 03:01:34,950
LOT BETTER ON OVER TIME, 

5568
03:01:34,950 --> 03:01:35,517
CONTENT POLICY ENFORCEMENT. 

5569
03:01:35,517 --> 03:01:36,752
THE HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT HERE 

5570
03:01:36,752 --> 03:01:38,354
IS WE STARTED OFF IN MY DORM 

5571
03:01:38,354 --> 03:01:39,755
ROOM WITH NOT A LOT OF 

5572
03:01:39,755 --> 03:01:41,256
RESOURCES AND NOT HAVING THE AI 

5573
03:01:41,256 --> 03:01:42,558
TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO 

5574
03:01:42,558 --> 03:01:43,625
PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY A LOT OF 

5575
03:01:43,625 --> 03:01:43,959
THIS STUFF. 

5576
03:01:43,959 --> 03:01:47,663
SO JUST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER 

5577
03:01:47,663 --> 03:01:49,264
VOLUME OF CONTENT THE MAIN WAY 

5578
03:01:49,264 --> 03:01:51,033
THAT THIS WORKS TODAY IS THAT 

5579
03:01:51,033 --> 03:01:51,767
PEOPLE REPORT THINGS TO US AND 

5580
03:01:51,767 --> 03:01:53,101
THEN WE HAVE OUR TEAM REVIEW 

5581
03:01:53,101 --> 03:01:54,870
THAT AND AS I SAID BEFORE, BY 

5582
03:01:54,870 --> 03:01:56,605
THE END OF THIS YEAR WE'LL HAVE 

5583
03:01:56,605 --> 03:01:57,906
MORE THAN 20,000 PEOPLE AT THE 

5584
03:01:57,906 --> 03:01:59,641
COMPANY WORKING ON SECURITY AND 

5585
03:01:59,641 --> 03:02:00,308
CONTENT REVIEW BECAUSE THIS IS 

5586
03:02:00,308 --> 03:02:01,343
IMPORTANT. 

5587
03:02:03,345 --> 03:02:08,083
OVER TIME WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT 

5588
03:02:08,083 --> 03:02:08,951
INCREASINGLY TO A METHOD WHERE 

5589
03:02:08,951 --> 03:02:11,253
MORE OF THIS CONTENT IS FLAGGED 

5590
03:02:11,253 --> 03:02:15,858
UP FRONT BY AI TOOLS THAT WE 

5591
03:02:15,858 --> 03:02:16,258
DEVELOP. 

5592
03:02:16,258 --> 03:02:16,825
WE'VE PRIORITIZED THE MOST 

5593
03:02:16,825 --> 03:02:17,960
IMPORTANT TYPES OF CONTENT THAT 

5594
03:02:17,960 --> 03:02:21,964
WE CAN BUILD AI TOOLS FOR TODAY 

5595
03:02:21,964 --> 03:02:22,531
LIKE TERROR-RELATED CONTENT 

5596
03:02:22,531 --> 03:02:24,433
WHERE I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT 

5597
03:02:24,433 --> 03:02:25,834
OUR SYSTEMS THAT WE DEPLOY WHEN 

5598
03:02:25,834 --> 03:02:28,537
WE WERE TAKING DOWN 99% OF THE 

5599
03:02:28,537 --> 03:02:29,437
ISIS AND AL-QAEDA-RELATED 

5600
03:02:29,437 --> 03:02:32,574
CONTENT THAT WE TAKE DOWN 

5601
03:02:32,574 --> 03:02:33,642
BEFORE A PERSON EVEN FLAGS THEM 

5602
03:02:33,642 --> 03:02:33,909
TO US. 

5603
03:02:33,909 --> 03:02:35,544
IF WE FAST FORWARD FIVE OR 10 

5604
03:02:35,544 --> 03:02:36,945
YEARS, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO 

5605
03:02:36,945 --> 03:02:38,480
HAVE MORE AI TECHNOLOGY THAT 

5606
03:02:38,480 --> 03:02:40,049
CAN DO THAT IN MORE AREAS AND I 

5607
03:02:40,049 --> 03:02:41,350
THINK WE NEED TO GET THERE AS 

5608
03:02:41,350 --> 03:02:42,584
SOON AS POSSIBLE, WHICH IS WHY 

5609
03:02:42,584 --> 03:02:43,719
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT. 

5610
03:02:43,719 --> 03:02:45,154
>> I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. 

5611
03:02:45,154 --> 03:02:46,755
I JUST THINK WE CAN'T WAIT FIVE 

5612
03:02:46,755 --> 03:02:47,956
YEARS TO GET HOUSING 

5613
03:02:47,956 --> 03:02:48,757
DISCRIMINATION AND PERSONALLY 

5614
03:02:48,757 --> 03:02:50,092
OFFENSIVE MATERIAL OUT OF 

5615
03:02:50,092 --> 03:02:50,592
FACEBOOK. 

5616
03:02:50,592 --> 03:02:50,892
THANK YOU. 

5617
03:02:50,892 --> 03:02:53,094
>> I AGREE. 

5618
03:02:53,094 --> 03:02:54,196
>> SENATOR SASSE. 

5619
03:02:54,196 --> 03:02:56,431
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5620
03:02:56,431 --> 03:02:57,566
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANKS FOR 

5621
03:02:57,566 --> 03:02:57,966
BEING HERE. 

5622
03:02:57,966 --> 03:02:59,067
AT CURRENT PACE YOU'RE DUE TO 

5623
03:02:59,067 --> 03:03:00,669
BE DONE WITH FIRST ROUND OF 

5624
03:03:00,669 --> 03:03:04,173
QUESTIONING BY ABOUT 1 A.M. 

5625
03:03:04,173 --> 03:03:04,640
SO CONGRATULATIONS. 

5626
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:06,041
I LIKE CHRIS COONS A LOT WITH 

5627
03:03:06,041 --> 03:03:08,143
HIS OWN FAMILY OR WITH DAN 

5628
03:03:08,143 --> 03:03:08,576
SULLIVAN'S FAMILY. 

5629
03:03:08,576 --> 03:03:10,079
BOTH ARE GREAT PHOTOS, BUT I 

5630
03:03:10,079 --> 03:03:11,347
HAVE A SIMILAR SET OF QUESTIONS 

5631
03:03:11,347 --> 03:03:14,516
FROM THE OTHER SIDE MAYBE. 

5632
03:03:14,516 --> 03:03:15,550
I THINK THE CONCEPTUAL LINE 

5633
03:03:15,550 --> 03:03:17,653
BETWEEN MERE TECH COMPANY, MERE 

5634
03:03:17,653 --> 03:03:19,488
TOOLS AND AN ACTUAL CONTENT 

5635
03:03:19,488 --> 03:03:20,656
COMPANY, I THINK IT'S REALLY 

5636
03:03:20,656 --> 03:03:20,856
HARD. 

5637
03:03:20,856 --> 03:03:23,158
I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE A HARD 

5638
03:03:23,158 --> 03:03:23,458
CHALLENGE. 

5639
03:03:23,458 --> 03:03:24,193
I THINK REGULATION OVER TIME 

5640
03:03:24,193 --> 03:03:25,493
WILL HAVE A HARD CHALLENGE AND 

5641
03:03:25,493 --> 03:03:27,996
YOU'RE A PRIVATE COMPANY, SO 

5642
03:03:27,996 --> 03:03:31,667
YOU CAN MAKE POLICIES THAT MAY 

5643
03:03:31,667 --> 03:03:33,769
BE LESS THAN 1st AMENDMENT FULL 

5644
03:03:33,769 --> 03:03:35,237
SPIRIT EMBRACING IN MY VIEW, 

5645
03:03:35,237 --> 03:03:36,538
BUT I WORRY ABOUT THAT. 

5646
03:03:36,538 --> 03:03:37,839
I WORRY ABOUT A WORLD WHERE 

5647
03:03:37,839 --> 03:03:39,507
WHEN YOU GO FROM VIOLENT GROUPS 

5648
03:03:39,507 --> 03:03:42,377
TO HATE SPEECH IN A HURRY IN 

5649
03:03:42,377 --> 03:03:43,879
ONE OF YOUR RESPONSES TO ONE OF 

5650
03:03:43,879 --> 03:03:45,080
THE OPENING QUESTIONS, YOU MAY 

5651
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:46,181
DECIDE OR FACEBOOK MAY DECIDE 

5652
03:03:46,181 --> 03:03:48,050
IT NEEDS TO POLICE A WHOLE 

5653
03:03:48,050 --> 03:03:49,751
BUNCH OF SPEECH THAT I THINK 

5654
03:03:49,751 --> 03:03:51,653
AMERICA MIGHT BE BETTER OFF NOT 

5655
03:03:51,653 --> 03:03:52,921
HAVING MISSED BY ONE COMPANY 

5656
03:03:52,921 --> 03:03:55,257
THAT HAS A REALLY BIG AND 

5657
03:03:55,257 --> 03:03:55,823
POWERFUL PLATFORM. 

5658
03:03:55,823 --> 03:03:58,060
CAN YOU DEFINE HATE SPEECH? 

5659
03:03:59,261 --> 03:04:01,663
>> SENATOR, I THINK OF THIS AS 

5660
03:04:01,663 --> 03:04:02,864
A REALLY HARD QUESTION AND I 

5661
03:04:02,864 --> 03:04:04,466
THINK IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS 

5662
03:04:04,466 --> 03:04:06,134
WHY WE STRUGGLE WITH IT. 

5663
03:04:06,134 --> 03:04:09,338
THERE ARE CERTAIN DEFINITIONS 

5664
03:04:09,338 --> 03:04:14,842
THAT WE HAVE AROUND CALLING FOR 

5665
03:04:14,842 --> 03:04:16,144
VIOLENCE OR -- 

5666
03:04:16,144 --> 03:04:17,379
>> LET'S JUST AGREE ON THAT. 

5667
03:04:17,379 --> 03:04:18,480
IF SOMEBODY IS CALLING FOR 

5668
03:04:18,480 --> 03:04:19,581
VIOLENCE THAT, SHOULDN'T BE 

5669
03:04:19,581 --> 03:04:20,082
THERE. 

5670
03:04:20,082 --> 03:04:21,383
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE 

5671
03:04:21,383 --> 03:04:22,784
PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES AROUND 

5672
03:04:22,784 --> 03:04:23,852
SPEECH. 

5673
03:04:23,852 --> 03:04:27,656
YOU USE LANGUAGE OF SAFETY AND 

5674
03:04:27,656 --> 03:04:28,123
PROTECTION EARLIER. 

5675
03:04:28,123 --> 03:04:29,158
WE SEE THIS HAPPENING ON 

5676
03:04:29,158 --> 03:04:31,160
COLLEGE CAMPUSES AROUND THE 

5677
03:04:31,160 --> 03:04:31,693
COUNTRY. 

5678
03:04:31,693 --> 03:04:32,060
IT'S DANGEROUS. 

5679
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:34,163
40% OF AMERICANS UNDER AGE 35 

5680
03:04:34,163 --> 03:04:35,364
TELL POLLSTERS THEY THINK  THE 

5681
03:04:35,364 --> 03:04:36,531
1st AMENDMENT IS DANGEROUS 

5682
03:04:36,531 --> 03:04:37,666
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT USE YOUR 

5683
03:04:37,666 --> 03:04:39,268
FREEDOM TO SAY SOMETHING THAT 

5684
03:04:39,268 --> 03:04:41,436
HURTS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FEELINGS. 

5685
03:04:41,436 --> 03:04:41,737
GUESS WHAT? 

5686
03:04:41,737 --> 03:04:42,671
THERE'S SOME REALLY 

5687
03:04:42,671 --> 03:04:46,875
PASSIONATELY HELD VIEWS ON THE 

5688
03:04:46,875 --> 03:04:48,277
ABORTION ISSUE ON THIS PANEL 

5689
03:04:48,277 --> 03:04:48,510
TODAY. 

5690
03:04:48,510 --> 03:04:51,280
CAN YOU IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE 

5691
03:04:51,280 --> 03:04:53,048
PRO LIFERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM 

5692
03:04:53,048 --> 03:04:54,683
SPEAKING ABOUT THEIR VIEWS ON 

5693
03:04:54,683 --> 03:04:55,050
YOUR PLATFORM? 

5694
03:04:55,050 --> 03:04:55,817
>> I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT 

5695
03:04:55,817 --> 03:04:56,985
THAT TO BE THE CASE. 

5696
03:04:56,985 --> 03:04:58,987
>> BUT IT MIGHT REALLY BE 

5697
03:04:58,987 --> 03:05:00,355
UNSELLING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

5698
03:05:00,355 --> 03:05:01,990
HAD AN ABORTION TO -- 

5699
03:05:01,990 --> 03:05:02,958
UNSETTLING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

5700
03:05:02,958 --> 03:05:04,893
HAD AN ABORTION TO HAVE AN OPEN 

5701
03:05:04,893 --> 03:05:06,060
DEBATE ABOUT THAT, WOULDN'T IT? 

5702
03:05:06,060 --> 03:05:07,596
>> IT MIGHT BE, BUT I DON'T 

5703
03:05:07,596 --> 03:05:09,263
THINK THAT WOULD FIT ANY OF THE 

5704
03:05:09,263 --> 03:05:10,565
DEFINITIONS OF WHAT WE HAVE, 

5705
03:05:10,565 --> 03:05:11,500
BUT I DO GENERALLY AGREE WITH 

5706
03:05:11,500 --> 03:05:14,069
THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING, 

5707
03:05:14,069 --> 03:05:16,939
WHICH IS AS WE'RE ABLE TO 

5708
03:05:16,939 --> 03:05:17,772
TECHNOLOGICALLY SHIFT TOWARD 

5709
03:05:17,772 --> 03:05:19,374
ESPECIALLY HAVING AI 

5710
03:05:19,374 --> 03:05:20,976
PROACTIVELY LOOK AT CONTENT, I 

5711
03:05:20,976 --> 03:05:24,179
THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO 

5712
03:05:24,179 --> 03:05:24,980
CREATE MASSIVE QUESTIONS FOR 

5713
03:05:24,980 --> 03:05:26,181
SOCIETY ABOUT WHAT OBLIGATIONS 

5714
03:05:26,181 --> 03:05:30,085
WE WANT TO REQUIRE COMPANIES TO 

5715
03:05:30,085 --> 03:05:32,087
FULFILL AND I DO THINK THAT 

5716
03:05:32,087 --> 03:05:35,824
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE NEED 

5717
03:05:35,824 --> 03:05:46,602
TO STRUGGLE WITH AS A COUNTRY 

5718
03:05:46,602 --> 03:05:47,870
BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE. 

5719
03:05:47,870 --> 03:05:49,036
>> I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE 

5720
03:05:49,036 --> 03:05:50,839
HERE TODAY AND THINK THERE'S A 

5721
03:05:50,839 --> 03:05:51,940
UNIFIED VIEW IN THE CONGRESS 

5722
03:05:51,940 --> 03:05:53,175
THAT YOU SHOULD BE MOVING 

5723
03:05:53,175 --> 03:05:54,576
TOWARD POLICING MORE AND MORE 

5724
03:05:54,576 --> 03:05:54,809
SPEECH. 

5725
03:05:54,809 --> 03:05:56,945
I THINK VIOLENCE HAS NO PLACE 

5726
03:05:56,945 --> 03:05:57,779
ON YOUR PLATFORM. 

5727
03:05:57,779 --> 03:05:58,480
SEX TRAFFICKERS AND HUMAN 

5728
03:05:58,480 --> 03:05:59,781
TRAFFICKERS HAVE NO PLACE ON 

5729
03:05:59,781 --> 03:06:01,783
YOUR PLATFORM, BUT VIGOROUS 

5730
03:06:01,783 --> 03:06:03,785
DEBATES, ADULTS NEED TO ENGAGE 

5731
03:06:03,785 --> 03:06:04,252
IN VIGOROUS DEBATES. 

5732
03:06:04,252 --> 03:06:05,621
I HAVE ONLY A LITTLE LESS THAN 

5733
03:06:05,621 --> 03:06:07,022
TWO MINUTES LEFT. 

5734
03:06:07,022 --> 03:06:08,490
SO I WANT TO SHIFT GEARS, BUT 

5735
03:06:08,490 --> 03:06:09,624
THAT WAS ABOUT ADULTS. 

5736
03:06:09,624 --> 03:06:10,258
YOU'RE A DAD. 

5737
03:06:10,258 --> 03:06:12,361
I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 

5738
03:06:12,361 --> 03:06:13,462
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION. 

5739
03:06:14,629 --> 03:06:15,897
YOU STARTED YOUR COMMENTS TODAY 

5740
03:06:15,897 --> 03:06:17,165
BY TALKING ABOUT HOW FACEBOOK 

5741
03:06:17,165 --> 03:06:19,801
IS AND WAS FOUNDED AS AN 

5742
03:06:19,801 --> 03:06:20,234
OPTIMISTIC COMPANY. 

5743
03:06:20,234 --> 03:06:21,203
YOU AND I HAVE HAD 

5744
03:06:21,203 --> 03:06:22,271
CONVERSATIONS SEPARATE FROM 

5745
03:06:22,271 --> 03:06:22,471
HERE. 

5746
03:06:22,471 --> 03:06:24,172
I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN 

5747
03:06:24,172 --> 03:06:25,274
YOUR MOUTH, BUT I THINK AS 

5748
03:06:25,274 --> 03:06:26,875
YOU'VE AGED YOU MIGHT BE A 

5749
03:06:26,875 --> 03:06:28,710
LITTLE BIT LESS IDEALISTIC AND 

5750
03:06:28,710 --> 03:06:29,711
OPTIMISTIC THAN WHEN YOU 

5751
03:06:29,711 --> 03:06:30,479
STARTED FACEBOOK. 

5752
03:06:31,813 --> 03:06:33,715
AS A DAD, DO YOU WORRY ABOUT 

5753
03:06:33,715 --> 03:06:35,317
SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION AS A 

5754
03:06:35,317 --> 03:06:37,719
PROBLEM FOR AMERICA'S TEENS? 

5755
03:06:37,719 --> 03:06:40,022
>> WELL, MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN 

5756
03:06:40,022 --> 03:06:41,223
BE IDEALISTIC BUT HAVE A BROAD 

5757
03:06:41,223 --> 03:06:42,491
VIEW OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY. 

5758
03:06:43,492 --> 03:06:45,294
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT TEENS, THIS 

5759
03:06:45,294 --> 03:06:46,495
IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I 

5760
03:06:46,495 --> 03:06:47,696
THINK ANY PARENT THINKS ABOUT 

5761
03:06:47,696 --> 03:06:51,533
IS HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT YOUR 

5762
03:06:51,533 --> 03:06:53,234
KIDS USING TECHNOLOGY? 

5763
03:06:53,234 --> 03:06:54,603
AT FACEBOOK SPECIFICALLY I VIEW 

5764
03:06:54,603 --> 03:06:56,872
OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS NOT JUST 

5765
03:06:56,872 --> 03:06:57,673
BUILDING SERVICES THAT PEOPLE 

5766
03:06:57,673 --> 03:06:58,339
LIKE, BUT BUILDING SERVICES 

5767
03:06:58,339 --> 03:06:59,941
THAT ARE GOOD FOR PEOPLE AND 

5768
03:06:59,941 --> 03:07:01,610
GOOD FOR SOCIETY AS WELL. 

5769
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:05,414
SO WE STUDY A LOT OF EFFECTS OF 

5770
03:07:05,414 --> 03:07:08,216
WELL-BEING OF OUR TOOLS AND 

5771
03:07:08,216 --> 03:07:08,649
BROADER TECHNOLOGY. 

5772
03:07:08,649 --> 03:07:10,118
LIKE ANY TOOL THERE ARE GOOD 

5773
03:07:10,118 --> 03:07:11,386
AND BAD USES OF IT. 

5774
03:07:11,386 --> 03:07:14,489
WHAT WE FIND IN GENERAL IS THAT 

5775
03:07:14,489 --> 03:07:15,824
IF YOU'RE USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN 

5776
03:07:15,824 --> 03:07:17,726
ORDER TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS, 

5777
03:07:17,726 --> 03:07:19,227
RIGHT, SO YOU'RE SHARING 

5778
03:07:19,227 --> 03:07:21,296
CONTENT WITH FRIENDS, YOU'RE 

5779
03:07:21,296 --> 03:07:21,897
INTERACTING, THEN THAT IS 

5780
03:07:21,897 --> 03:07:24,800
ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF THE LONG 

5781
03:07:24,800 --> 03:07:26,201
TERM MEASURES OF WELL-BEING 

5782
03:07:26,201 --> 03:07:28,003
THAT YOU WOULD INTUITIVELY 

5783
03:07:28,003 --> 03:07:31,173
THINK OF, LONG TERM HEALTH, 

5784
03:07:31,173 --> 03:07:31,873
HAPPINESS, FEELING CONNECTED 

5785
03:07:31,873 --> 03:07:33,308
AND LESS LONELY, BUT IF YOU'RE 

5786
03:07:33,308 --> 03:07:34,409
USING THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL 

5787
03:07:34,409 --> 03:07:36,111
MEDIA TO PRIMARILY JUST 

5788
03:07:36,111 --> 03:07:37,312
PASSIVELY CONSUME CONTENT AND 

5789
03:07:37,312 --> 03:07:38,413
YOU'RE NOT ENGAGING  WITH OTHER 

5790
03:07:38,413 --> 03:07:39,714
PEOPLE, THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE 

5791
03:07:39,714 --> 03:07:40,481
THOSE POSITIVE EFFECTS AND IT 

5792
03:07:40,481 --> 03:07:41,382
COULD BE NEGATIVE. 

5793
03:07:41,382 --> 03:07:42,984
>> WE'RE ALMOST AT TIME. 

5794
03:07:42,984 --> 03:07:44,519
DO SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HIRE 

5795
03:07:44,519 --> 03:07:45,620
CONSULTING FIRMS TO HELP THEM 

5796
03:07:45,620 --> 03:07:50,325
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE 

5797
03:07:50,325 --> 03:07:51,126
DOPAMINE FEEDBACK LOOPS SO THAT 

5798
03:07:51,126 --> 03:07:53,028
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE 

5799
03:07:53,028 --> 03:07:53,495
PLATFORM? 

5800
03:07:53,495 --> 03:07:53,895
>> NO, SENATOR. 

5801
03:07:53,895 --> 03:07:56,631
THAT'S NOT HOW WE TALK ABOUT 

5802
03:07:56,631 --> 03:07:59,501
THIS OR HOW WE SET UP OUR 

5803
03:07:59,501 --> 03:07:59,868
PRODUCT TEAMS. 

5804
03:07:59,868 --> 03:08:01,303
WE WANT OUR PRODUCTS TO BE 

5805
03:08:01,303 --> 03:08:02,871
VALUABLE TO PEOPLE AND IF 

5806
03:08:02,871 --> 03:08:03,772
THEY'RE VALUABLE, PEOPLE CHOOSE 

5807
03:08:03,772 --> 03:08:04,573
TO USE THEM. 

5808
03:08:04,573 --> 03:08:05,707
>> ARE YOU AWARE THERE ARE 

5809
03:08:05,707 --> 03:08:07,242
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT DO 

5810
03:08:07,242 --> 03:08:08,343
HIRE SUCH CONSULTANTS? 

5811
03:08:08,343 --> 03:08:12,647
>> NOT SITTING HERE TODAY. 

5812
03:08:12,647 --> 03:08:13,048
>> THANKS. 

5813
03:08:13,048 --> 03:08:13,548
>> SENATOR MARKEY. 

5814
03:08:13,548 --> 03:08:14,583
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5815
03:08:17,919 --> 03:08:20,622
IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR 

5816
03:08:20,622 --> 03:08:21,322
BLUMENTHAL'S POINTED QUESTIONS, 

5817
03:08:21,322 --> 03:08:23,859
YOU REFUSED TO ANSWER WHETHER 

5818
03:08:23,859 --> 03:08:26,628
FACEBOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED BY 

5819
03:08:26,628 --> 03:08:31,800
LAW TO OBTAIN CLEAR PERMISSION  

5820
03:08:31,800 --> 03:08:32,901
SHARING THEIR PERSONAL 

5821
03:08:32,901 --> 03:08:33,134
INFORMATION. 

5822
03:08:33,635 --> 03:08:36,972
SO I'M GOING TO ASK IT ONE MORE 

5823
03:08:36,972 --> 03:08:39,774
TIME, YES OR NO. 

5824
03:08:39,774 --> 03:08:43,812
SHOULD FACEBOOK GET CLEAR 

5825
03:08:43,812 --> 03:08:45,013
PERMISSION FROM USERS BEFORE 

5826
03:08:45,013 --> 03:08:47,315
SELLING OR SHARING SENSITIVE 

5827
03:08:47,315 --> 03:08:49,017
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, 

5828
03:08:49,017 --> 03:08:50,719
YOUR FINANCES, YOUR 

5829
03:08:50,719 --> 03:08:51,086
RELATIONSHIPS? 

5830
03:08:51,086 --> 03:08:55,424
SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GET THEIR 

5831
03:08:55,424 --> 03:08:55,724
PERMISSION? 

5832
03:08:55,724 --> 03:08:56,325
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY A CONSENT 

5833
03:08:56,325 --> 03:08:57,492
DECREE WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE 

5834
03:08:57,492 --> 03:08:59,895
COMMISSION THAT YOU SIGNED IN 

5835
03:08:59,895 --> 03:09:00,328
2011. 

5836
03:09:00,328 --> 03:09:02,197
SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GET 

5837
03:09:02,197 --> 03:09:02,530
PERMISSION? 

5838
03:09:02,530 --> 03:09:03,497
SHOULD THE CONSUMER HAVE TO OPT 

5839
03:09:03,497 --> 03:09:05,500
IN? 

5840
03:09:08,904 --> 03:09:11,706
>> SENATOR, WE DO REQUIRE 

5841
03:09:11,706 --> 03:09:13,141
PERMISSION TO USE THE SYSTEM 

5842
03:09:13,141 --> 03:09:14,309
AND TO PUT INFORMATION IN THERE 

5843
03:09:14,309 --> 03:09:16,078
AND FOR ALL THE USES OF IT. 

5844
03:09:16,711 --> 03:09:18,546
I WANT TO BE CLEAR. 

5845
03:09:18,546 --> 03:09:19,847
WE DON'T SELL INFORMATION. 

5846
03:09:19,847 --> 03:09:21,116
SO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE 

5847
03:09:21,116 --> 03:09:22,317
COULD GET PERMISSION TO DO 

5848
03:09:22,317 --> 03:09:24,619
THAT, THAT'S JUST NOT A THING 

5849
03:09:24,619 --> 03:09:25,586
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO DO. 

5850
03:09:25,586 --> 03:09:30,158
>> SO WOULD YOU SUPPORT 

5851
03:09:30,158 --> 03:09:30,592
LEGISLATION? 

5852
03:09:30,592 --> 03:09:32,294
I HAVE A BILL. 

5853
03:09:32,294 --> 03:09:33,228
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL REFERRED TO 

5854
03:09:33,228 --> 03:09:34,396
IT, THE CONSENT ACT THIS WOULD 

5855
03:09:34,396 --> 03:09:36,298
JUST PUT ON THE BOOKS A LAW 

5856
03:09:36,298 --> 03:09:38,400
THAT SAID THAT FACEBOOK AND ANY 

5857
03:09:38,400 --> 03:09:41,770
OTHER COMPANY THAT GATHERS 

5858
03:09:41,770 --> 03:09:43,405
INFORMATION ABOUT AMERICANS HAS 

5859
03:09:43,405 --> 03:09:45,373
TO GET THEIR PERMISSION, THEIR 

5860
03:09:45,373 --> 03:09:46,407
AFFIRMATIVE PERMISSION, BEFORE 

5861
03:09:46,407 --> 03:09:48,510
IT CAN BE REUSED FOR OTHER 

5862
03:09:48,510 --> 03:09:48,810
PURPOSES. 

5863
03:09:48,810 --> 03:09:49,644
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT 

5864
03:09:49,644 --> 03:09:51,813
LEGISLATION TO MAKE IT A 

5865
03:09:51,813 --> 03:09:52,614
NATIONAL STANDARD FOR NOT JUST 

5866
03:09:52,614 --> 03:09:54,416
FACEBOOK, BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER 

5867
03:09:54,416 --> 03:09:56,151
COMPANIES OUT THERE, SOME OF 

5868
03:09:56,151 --> 03:09:57,652
THEM BAD ACTORS? 

5869
03:09:57,652 --> 03:09:58,586
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT 

5870
03:09:58,586 --> 03:09:59,221
LEGISLATION? 

5871
03:10:00,121 --> 03:10:01,656
>> SENATOR, IN GENERAL I THINK 

5872
03:10:01,656 --> 03:10:02,524
THAT THAT PRINCIPLE IS EXACTLY 

5873
03:10:02,524 --> 03:10:05,227
RIGHT AND I THINK WE SHOULD 

5874
03:10:05,227 --> 03:10:08,396
HAVE A DISCUSSION AROUND HOW TO 

5875
03:10:08,396 --> 03:10:09,131
BEST CODIFY THAT. 

5876
03:10:09,131 --> 03:10:11,366
>> BUT WOULD YOU SUPPORT 

5877
03:10:11,366 --> 03:10:12,133
LEGISLATION TO BACK THAT 

5878
03:10:12,133 --> 03:10:13,635
GENERAL PRINCIPLE, THAT OPT IN, 

5879
03:10:13,635 --> 03:10:14,970
THAT GETTING PERMISSION IS THE 

5880
03:10:14,970 --> 03:10:15,504
CENTER? 

5881
03:10:15,504 --> 03:10:16,271
WOULD YOU SUPPORT LEGISLATION 

5882
03:10:16,271 --> 03:10:19,841
AND MAKE THAT THE AMERICAN 

5883
03:10:19,841 --> 03:10:20,108
STANDARD? 

5884
03:10:20,108 --> 03:10:21,209
EUROPEANS PASSED THAT AS A LAW. 

5885
03:10:21,209 --> 03:10:22,711
FACEBOOK WILL LIVE WITH THAT 

5886
03:10:22,711 --> 03:10:24,312
LAW BEGINNING MAY 25th. 

5887
03:10:24,312 --> 03:10:25,514
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT AS THE 

5888
03:10:25,514 --> 03:10:26,915
LAW IN THE UNITED STATES? 

5889
03:10:29,751 --> 03:10:30,852
>> SENATOR, AS A PRINCIPLE, 

5890
03:10:30,852 --> 03:10:31,653
YES, I WOULD. 

5891
03:10:31,653 --> 03:10:34,122
I THINK THE DETAILS MATTER A 

5892
03:10:34,122 --> 03:10:34,589
LOT. 

5893
03:10:34,589 --> 03:10:34,856
>> RIGHT. 

5894
03:10:34,856 --> 03:10:36,625
ASSUMING WE WORKED OUT THE 

5895
03:10:36,625 --> 03:10:39,227
DETAILS YOU DO SUPPORT OPT IN 

5896
03:10:39,227 --> 03:10:42,130
AS THE STANDARD, GETTING 

5897
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:42,797
PERMISSION AFFIRMATIVELY AS THE 

5898
03:10:42,797 --> 03:10:45,400
STANDARD FOR THE UNITED STATES? 

5899
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:46,300
IS THAT CORRECT? 

5900
03:10:46,300 --> 03:10:48,303
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THAT'S 

5901
03:10:48,303 --> 03:10:48,903
THE RIGHT PRINCIPLE AND 100 

5902
03:10:48,903 --> 03:10:50,205
BILLION TIMES A DAY IN OUR 

5903
03:10:50,205 --> 03:10:51,406
SERVICES WHEN PEOPLE GO TO 

5904
03:10:51,406 --> 03:10:52,607
SHARE CONTENT THEY CHOOSE WHO 

5905
03:10:52,607 --> 03:10:55,043
THEY WANT TO SHARE IT WITH 

5906
03:10:55,043 --> 03:10:55,410
AFFIRMATIVELY. 

5907
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:56,944
>> SO YOU COULD SUPPORT A LAW 

5908
03:10:56,944 --> 03:10:59,047
THAT ENSHRINES THAT AS THE 

5909
03:10:59,047 --> 03:11:01,316
PROMISE THAT WE MAKE TO THE 

5910
03:11:01,316 --> 03:11:02,750
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT PERMISSION 

5911
03:11:02,750 --> 03:11:05,754
HAS TO BE OBTAINED BEFORE THEIR 

5912
03:11:05,754 --> 03:11:06,488
INFORMATION IS USED. 

5913
03:11:06,488 --> 03:11:07,254
IS THAT CORRECT? 

5914
03:11:07,254 --> 03:11:08,256
>> SENATOR, YES. 

5915
03:11:08,256 --> 03:11:09,124
I SAID THAT IN PRINCIPLE I 

5916
03:11:09,124 --> 03:11:10,725
THINK THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND 

5917
03:11:10,725 --> 03:11:12,260
THE DETAILS MATTER AND I LOOK 

5918
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:13,762
FORWARD TO HAVING OUR TEAM WORK 

5919
03:11:13,762 --> 03:11:16,631
WITH YOU ON FLUSHING THAT OUT. 

5920
03:11:16,631 --> 03:11:16,931
>> RIGHT. 

5921
03:11:16,931 --> 03:11:19,834
SO THE NEXT SUBJECT BECAUSE I 

5922
03:11:19,834 --> 03:11:21,736
WANT TO AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT WE 

5923
03:11:21,736 --> 03:11:24,672
KIND OF DRILL DOWN HERE, YOU 

5924
03:11:24,672 --> 03:11:26,942
EARLIER MADE REFERENCE TO THE 

5925
03:11:26,942 --> 03:11:28,543
CHILD ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION 

5926
03:11:28,543 --> 03:11:30,712
ACT OF 1999 WHICH I AM THE 

5927
03:11:30,712 --> 03:11:31,112
AUTHOR OF. 

5928
03:11:31,112 --> 03:11:34,249
SO THAT IS THE CONSTITUTION FOR 

5929
03:11:34,249 --> 03:11:35,050
CHILD PRIVACY PROTECTION ONLINE 

5930
03:11:35,050 --> 03:11:37,652
IN THE COUNTRY AND I'M VERY 

5931
03:11:37,652 --> 03:11:40,655
PROUD OF THAT, BUT THERE ARE NO 

5932
03:11:40,655 --> 03:11:41,957
PROTECTIONS ADDITIONALLY FOR 13 

5933
03:11:41,957 --> 03:11:43,825
OR 14 OR 15-YEAR-OLDS. 

5934
03:11:43,825 --> 03:11:45,427
THEY GET THE SAME PROTECTIONS 

5935
03:11:45,427 --> 03:11:48,930
THAT A 30-YEAR-OLD OR A 50-YEAR-

5936
03:11:48,930 --> 03:11:49,196
OLD GET. 

5937
03:11:49,196 --> 03:11:53,935
SO I HAVE A SEPARATE PIECE OF 

5938
03:11:53,935 --> 03:11:55,737
LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT KIDS 

5939
03:11:55,737 --> 03:11:59,841
WHO ARE UNDER 16 ABSOLUTELY 

5940
03:11:59,841 --> 03:12:02,877
HAVE A PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS 

5941
03:12:02,877 --> 03:12:06,181
AND THAT PERMISSION HAS TO BE 

5942
03:12:06,181 --> 03:12:08,550
RECEIVED FROM THEIR PARENTS OR 

5943
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:10,352
THE CHILDREN BEFORE ANY OF 

5944
03:12:10,352 --> 03:12:12,153
THEIR INFORMATION IS REUSED FOR 

5945
03:12:12,153 --> 03:12:13,855
ANY OTHER PURPOSE OTHER THAN 

5946
03:12:13,855 --> 03:12:17,158
THAT WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY 

5947
03:12:17,158 --> 03:12:17,559
INTENDED. 

5948
03:12:17,559 --> 03:12:20,662
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A CHILD 

5949
03:12:20,662 --> 03:12:22,230
ONLINE PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS 

5950
03:12:22,230 --> 03:12:25,133
FOR KIDS UNDER 16 TO GUARANTEE 

5951
03:12:25,133 --> 03:12:26,635
THAT THAT INFORMATION IS NOT 

5952
03:12:26,635 --> 03:12:28,737
REUSED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE 

5953
03:12:28,737 --> 03:12:29,404
WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION 

5954
03:12:29,404 --> 03:12:31,506
FROM THE PARENTS OR THE KIDS? 

5955
03:12:34,109 --> 03:12:35,977
>> SENATOR, I THINK AS A 

5956
03:12:35,977 --> 03:12:37,979
GENERAL PRINCIPLE, I THINK 

5957
03:12:37,979 --> 03:12:38,880
PROTECTING MINORS AND 

5958
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:40,582
PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY IS 

5959
03:12:40,582 --> 03:12:41,883
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE DO A 

5960
03:12:41,883 --> 03:12:43,284
NUMBER OF THINGS ON FACEBOOK TO 

5961
03:12:43,284 --> 03:12:44,452
DO THAT ALREADY, WHICH I'M 

5962
03:12:44,452 --> 03:12:45,386
HAPPY TO -- 

5963
03:12:45,386 --> 03:12:46,287
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

5964
03:12:46,287 --> 03:12:47,655
I'M TALKING ABOUT A LAW. 

5965
03:12:47,655 --> 03:12:50,592
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A LAW TO 

5966
03:12:50,592 --> 03:12:53,461
ENSURE THAT KIDS UNDER 16 HAVE 

5967
03:12:53,461 --> 03:12:54,896
THIS PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS? 

5968
03:12:54,896 --> 03:12:56,464
I HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH 

5969
03:12:56,464 --> 03:12:59,467
YOU IN YOUR OFFICE SEVEN YEARS 

5970
03:12:59,467 --> 03:13:01,970
AGO ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC SUBJECT 

5971
03:13:01,970 --> 03:13:03,471
IN PALO ALTO AND I THINK THAT'S 

5972
03:13:03,471 --> 03:13:04,639
REALLY WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

5973
03:13:04,639 --> 03:13:06,374
WANT TO KNOW RIGHT NOW. 

5974
03:13:06,374 --> 03:13:10,011
WHAT IS THE PROTECTIONS? 

5975
03:13:10,011 --> 03:13:10,878
WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT 

5976
03:13:10,878 --> 03:13:12,080
ARE GOING TO BE PUT ON THE 

5977
03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:13,982
BOOKS FOR THEIR FAMILIES, BUT 

5978
03:13:13,982 --> 03:13:14,949
ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR CHILDREN? 

5979
03:13:14,949 --> 03:13:15,684
WOULD YOU SUPPORT A PRIVACY 

5980
03:13:15,684 --> 03:13:17,085
BILL OF RIGHTS FOR KIDS WHERE 

5981
03:13:17,085 --> 03:13:18,453
OPT IN IS THE STANDARD, YES OR 

5982
03:13:18,453 --> 03:13:19,154
NO? 

5983
03:13:20,021 --> 03:13:22,156
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT THAT'S 

5984
03:13:22,156 --> 03:13:22,924
AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE. 

5985
03:13:22,924 --> 03:13:26,895
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

5986
03:13:26,895 --> 03:13:28,363
THAT'S MY QUESTION TO YOU. 

5987
03:13:28,363 --> 03:13:31,466
DO YOU BELIEVE WE NEED A LAW TO 

5988
03:13:31,466 --> 03:13:32,967
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT SURE IF WE 

5989
03:13:32,967 --> 03:13:35,370
NEED A LAW, BUT I THINK THIS IS 

5990
03:13:35,370 --> 03:13:38,440
CERTAINLY A THING THAT DESERVES 

5991
03:13:38,440 --> 03:13:40,074
A LOT OF DISCUSSION. 

5992
03:13:40,074 --> 03:13:42,877
>> I COULDN'T DISAGREE WITH YOU 

5993
03:13:42,877 --> 03:13:43,077
MORE. 

5994
03:13:43,077 --> 03:13:50,285
WE'RE LEAVING THESE CHILDREN TO 

5995
03:13:50,285 --> 03:13:54,889
THE MOST REFATIOUS COMMERCIAL 

5996
03:13:54,889 --> 03:13:56,791
-- REPATIOUS COMMERCIAL 

5997
03:13:56,791 --> 03:13:58,359
PREDATORS IN THE COUNTRY. 

5998
03:13:58,359 --> 03:14:00,695
>> PLEASE GIVE A SHORT ANSWER. 

5999
03:14:00,695 --> 03:14:02,063
>> SENATOR, I LOOK FORWARD TO 

6000
03:14:02,063 --> 03:14:03,163
HAVING MY TEAM FOLLOW UP TO 

6001
03:14:03,163 --> 03:14:06,567
FLUSH OUT THE DETAILS OF IT. 

6002
03:14:06,567 --> 03:14:08,202
>> SENATOR FLAKE. 

6003
03:14:08,202 --> 03:14:10,437
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6004
03:14:10,437 --> 03:14:12,073
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 

6005
03:14:12,073 --> 03:14:13,274
THANKS FOR ENDURING SO FAR AND 

6006
03:14:13,274 --> 03:14:15,409
I'M SORRY IF I PLOW OLD GROUND. 

6007
03:14:15,409 --> 03:14:17,679
I HAD TO BE AWAY FOR A BIT. 

6008
03:14:20,615 --> 03:14:21,282
I MYSELF AND SENATOR COONS, 

6009
03:14:21,282 --> 03:14:22,383
SENATOR PETERS AND A FEW OTHERS 

6010
03:14:22,383 --> 03:14:24,819
WERE IN THE COUNTRY OF ZIMBABWE 

6011
03:14:24,819 --> 03:14:25,887
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. 

6012
03:14:25,887 --> 03:14:29,390
WE MET WITH OPPOSITION FIGURES 

6013
03:14:29,390 --> 03:14:30,592
WHO HAD TALKED ABOUT THEIR GOAL 

6014
03:14:30,592 --> 03:14:33,795
IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO 

6015
03:14:33,795 --> 03:14:35,897
STATE RUN MEDIA IN MANY AFRICAN 

6016
03:14:35,897 --> 03:14:36,898
COUNTRIES, MANY COUNTRIES 

6017
03:14:36,898 --> 03:14:40,101
AROUND THE WORLD, THIRD WORLD 

6018
03:14:40,101 --> 03:14:41,102
COUNTRIES, SMALL COUNTRIES. 

6019
03:14:41,102 --> 03:14:44,539
THE ONLY TRADITIONAL MEDIA IS 

6020
03:14:44,539 --> 03:14:47,374
STATE RUN AND WE ASKED THEM HOW 

6021
03:14:47,374 --> 03:14:49,911
THEY GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT AND 

6022
03:14:49,911 --> 03:14:51,112
IT'S THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. 

6023
03:14:51,112 --> 03:14:51,813
FACEBOOK PROVIDES A VERY 

6024
03:14:51,813 --> 03:14:54,082
VALUABLE SERVICE IN MANY 

6025
03:14:54,082 --> 03:14:55,116
COUNTRIES FOR OPPOSITION 

6026
03:14:55,116 --> 03:14:57,519
LEADERS OR OTHERS WHO SIMPLY 

6027
03:14:57,519 --> 03:14:59,287
DON'T HAVE ACCESS UNLESS MAYBE 

6028
03:14:59,287 --> 03:15:01,923
JUST BEFORE AN ELECTION TO 

6029
03:15:01,923 --> 03:15:02,657
TRADITIONAL MEDIA. 

6030
03:15:04,726 --> 03:15:06,294
SO THAT'S VERY VALUABLE AND I 

6031
03:15:06,294 --> 03:15:08,096
THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT. 

6032
03:15:08,096 --> 03:15:13,835
ON THE FLIP SIDE WE'VE SEEN 

6033
03:15:13,835 --> 03:15:15,303
WITH THE ROHINGYA, THAT EXAMPLE 

6034
03:15:15,303 --> 03:15:16,971
OF WHERE THE STATE CAN USE 

6035
03:15:16,971 --> 03:15:18,173
SIMILAR DATA OR USE THIS 

6036
03:15:18,173 --> 03:15:19,407
PLATFORM TO GO AFTER PEOPLE. 

6037
03:15:19,407 --> 03:15:20,508
YOU TALKED ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE 

6038
03:15:20,508 --> 03:15:25,413
DOING IN THAT REGARD, HIRING 

6039
03:15:25,413 --> 03:15:27,515
MORE TRADITIONAL OR LOCAL 

6040
03:15:27,515 --> 03:15:27,982
LANGUAGE SPEAKERS. 

6041
03:15:27,982 --> 03:15:29,818
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU DOING IN THAT 

6042
03:15:29,818 --> 03:15:32,086
REGARD TO ENSURE THAT THESE 

6043
03:15:32,086 --> 03:15:34,422
STATES DON'T -- OR THESE 

6044
03:15:34,422 --> 03:15:35,623
GOVERNMENTS DON'T GO AFTER 

6045
03:15:35,623 --> 03:15:36,758
OPPOSITION FIGURES OR OTHERS? 

6046
03:15:37,692 --> 03:15:38,593
>> SENATOR, THERE ARE THREE 

6047
03:15:38,593 --> 03:15:41,429
MAIN THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING IN 

6048
03:15:41,429 --> 03:15:42,597
MYANMAR SPECIFICALLY AND THAT 

6049
03:15:42,597 --> 03:15:44,599
WILL APPLY TO OTHER SITUATIONS 

6050
03:15:44,599 --> 03:15:45,733
LIKE THAT. 

6051
03:15:45,733 --> 03:15:47,735
THE FIRST IS HIRING ENOUGH 

6052
03:15:47,735 --> 03:15:49,670
PEOPLE TO DO LOCAL LANGUAGE 

6053
03:15:49,670 --> 03:15:50,772
SUPPORT BECAUSE THE DEFINITION 

6054
03:15:50,772 --> 03:15:53,407
OF HATE SPEECH OR THINGS THAT 

6055
03:15:53,407 --> 03:15:55,810
CAN BE RACIALLY CODED TO INCITE 

6056
03:15:55,810 --> 03:15:56,911
VIOLENCE ARE VERY LANGUAGE 

6057
03:15:56,911 --> 03:15:58,513
SPECIFIC AND WE CAN'T DO THAT 

6058
03:15:58,513 --> 03:15:59,848
WITH JUST ENGLISH SPEAKERS FOR 

6059
03:15:59,848 --> 03:16:00,848
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. 

6060
03:16:00,848 --> 03:16:02,617
SO WE NEED TO GROW THAT. 

6061
03:16:02,617 --> 03:16:04,819
THE SECOND IS IN THESE 

6062
03:16:04,819 --> 03:16:06,721
COUNTRIES THERE TEND TO BE 

6063
03:16:06,721 --> 03:16:08,323
ACTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY WHO CAN 

6064
03:16:08,323 --> 03:16:11,025
HELP US IDENTIFY THE FIGURES 

6065
03:16:11,025 --> 03:16:12,126
WHO ARE SPREADING HATE AND WE 

6066
03:16:12,126 --> 03:16:13,595
CA WORK WITH THEM IN ORDER TO 

6067
03:16:13,595 --> 03:16:15,162
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FIGURES 

6068
03:16:15,162 --> 03:16:16,831
DON'T HAVE A PLACE ON OUR 

6069
03:16:16,831 --> 03:16:17,098
PLATFORM. 

6070
03:16:17,098 --> 03:16:19,434
THE THIRD IS THAT THERE ARE 

6071
03:16:19,434 --> 03:16:22,637
SPECIFIC PRODUCT CHANGES THAT 

6072
03:16:22,637 --> 03:16:25,773
WE CAN MAKE THAT MIGHT BE 

6073
03:16:25,773 --> 03:16:26,641
NECESSARY IN SOME COUNTRIES, 

6074
03:16:26,641 --> 03:16:28,743
BUT NOT OTHERS INCLUDING THINGS 

6075
03:16:28,743 --> 03:16:31,445
AROUND NEWS LITERACY, RIGHT? 

6076
03:16:31,445 --> 03:16:35,917
AND LIKE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE IN 

6077
03:16:35,917 --> 03:16:38,419
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ABOUT 

6078
03:16:38,419 --> 03:16:40,121
RAMPING UP OUR DOWN THINGS WE 

6079
03:16:40,121 --> 03:16:42,523
MIGHT DO AROUND FACT CHECKING 

6080
03:16:42,523 --> 03:16:43,424
OF CONTENT, SPECIFIC PRODUCT 

6081
03:16:43,424 --> 03:16:44,826
TYPE THINGS THAT WE WOULD WANT 

6082
03:16:44,826 --> 03:16:46,560
TO IMPLEMENT IN DIFFERENT 

6083
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:47,962
PLACES, BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S 

6084
03:16:47,962 --> 03:16:48,930
SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 

6085
03:16:48,930 --> 03:16:51,366
TO DO IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. 

6086
03:16:51,366 --> 03:16:52,734
>> THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY LIMITS 

6087
03:16:52,734 --> 03:16:53,901
OF NATIVE SPEAKERS YOU CAN HIRE 

6088
03:16:53,901 --> 03:16:59,307
OR PEOPLE THAT HAVE EYES ON THE 

6089
03:16:59,307 --> 03:16:59,740
PAGE. 

6090
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:00,307
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS 

6091
03:17:00,307 --> 03:17:02,210
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE BULK 

6092
03:17:02,210 --> 03:17:02,510
OF THIS. 

6093
03:17:02,510 --> 03:17:04,612
HOW MUCH ARE YOU INVESTING AND 

6094
03:17:04,612 --> 03:17:12,720
WORKING ON THAT TOOL TO DO WHAT 

6095
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:14,122
REALLY WE DON'T HAVE OR CAN'T 

6096
03:17:14,122 --> 03:17:15,489
HIRE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO? 

6097
03:17:15,489 --> 03:17:16,357
>> SENATOR, I THINK YOU'RE 

6098
03:17:16,357 --> 03:17:17,725
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT OVER THE 

6099
03:17:17,725 --> 03:17:19,093
LONG TERM BUILDING AI TOOLS IS 

6100
03:17:19,093 --> 03:17:23,598
GOING TO BE THE SCALABLE WAY TO 

6101
03:17:23,598 --> 03:17:25,133
IDENTIFY AND ROOT OUT MOST OF 

6102
03:17:25,133 --> 03:17:26,166
THIS HARMFUL CONTENT. 

6103
03:17:26,166 --> 03:17:27,034
WE'RE INVESTING A LOT IN DOING 

6104
03:17:27,034 --> 03:17:28,703
THAT AS WELL AS SCALING UP THE 

6105
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:34,275
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING 

6106
03:17:34,275 --> 03:17:34,642
CONTENT REVIEW. 

6107
03:17:34,642 --> 03:17:35,176
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE 

6108
03:17:35,176 --> 03:17:36,210
MENTIONED IS THIS YEAR OR IN 

6109
03:17:36,210 --> 03:17:37,812
THE LAST YEAR WE'VE BASICALLY 

6110
03:17:37,812 --> 03:17:38,913
DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 

6111
03:17:38,913 --> 03:17:40,214
DOING SECURITY AND CONTENT 

6112
03:17:40,214 --> 03:17:40,448
REVIEW. 

6113
03:17:40,448 --> 03:17:41,816
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE THAN 

6114
03:17:41,816 --> 03:17:42,817
20,000 PEOPLE WORKING ON 

6115
03:17:42,817 --> 03:17:44,152
SECURITY AND CONTENT REVIEW BY 

6116
03:17:44,152 --> 03:17:45,620
THE END OF THIS YEAR. 

6117
03:17:45,620 --> 03:17:46,821
SO IT'S GOING TO BE COUPLING 

6118
03:17:46,821 --> 03:17:47,722
CONTINUING TO GROW THE PEOPLE 

6119
03:17:47,722 --> 03:17:55,229
WHO ARE DOING REVIEW IN THESE 

6120
03:17:55,229 --> 03:17:56,764
PLACES WITH BUILDING AI TOOLS. 

6121
03:17:56,764 --> 03:17:58,232
WE'RE WORKING AS QUICKLY AS WE 

6122
03:17:58,232 --> 03:17:59,934
CAN ON THAT, BUT SOME OF THE 

6123
03:17:59,934 --> 03:18:01,202
STUFF IS JUST HARD. 

6124
03:18:01,202 --> 03:18:02,503
THAT I THINK WILL HELP US GET 

6125
03:18:02,503 --> 03:18:03,805
TO A BETTER PLACE ON 

6126
03:18:03,805 --> 03:18:06,140
ELIMINATING MORE OF THIS 

6127
03:18:06,140 --> 03:18:06,607
HARMFUL CONTENT. 

6128
03:18:06,607 --> 03:18:07,942
>> THANK YOU. 

6129
03:18:07,942 --> 03:18:09,310
YOU'VE TALKED SOME ABOUT THAT, 

6130
03:18:09,310 --> 03:18:09,610
I KNOW. 

6131
03:18:09,610 --> 03:18:12,013
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA OR 

6132
03:18:12,013 --> 03:18:12,914
CHINESE GOVERNMENTS HAVE 

6133
03:18:12,914 --> 03:18:14,716
HARVESTED FACEBOOK DATA AND 

6134
03:18:14,716 --> 03:18:17,118
HAVE DETAILED DATA SETS ON 

6135
03:18:17,118 --> 03:18:21,255
FACEBOOK USERS? 

6136
03:18:21,255 --> 03:18:23,357
HAS YOUR FORENSIC ANALYSIS 

6137
03:18:23,357 --> 03:18:24,025
SHOWN YOU WHO ELSE OTHER THAN 

6138
03:18:24,025 --> 03:18:24,692
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA DOWNLOADED 

6139
03:18:24,692 --> 03:18:25,793
THIS KIND OF DATA? 

6140
03:18:25,793 --> 03:18:27,428
>> SENATOR, WE HAVE KICKED OFF 

6141
03:18:27,428 --> 03:18:28,529
AN INVESTIGATION OF EVERY APP 

6142
03:18:28,529 --> 03:18:31,232
THAT HAD ACCESS TO A LARGE 

6143
03:18:31,232 --> 03:18:32,233
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE'S DATA BEFORE 

6144
03:18:32,233 --> 03:18:35,003
WE LOCKED DOWN THE PLATFORM IN 

6145
03:18:35,003 --> 03:18:35,336
2014. 

6146
03:18:35,336 --> 03:18:35,736
THAT'S UNDERWAY. 

6147
03:18:35,736 --> 03:18:37,171
I IMAGINE WE'LL FIND SOME 

6148
03:18:37,171 --> 03:18:38,806
THINGS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO 

6149
03:18:38,806 --> 03:18:40,141
TELLING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 

6150
03:18:40,141 --> 03:18:41,709
AFFECTED WHEN WE DO. 

6151
03:18:41,709 --> 03:18:43,845
I DON'T THINK SITTING HERE 

6152
03:18:43,845 --> 03:18:48,015
TODAY THAT WE HAVE SPECIFIC 

6153
03:18:48,015 --> 03:18:49,717
KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER EFFORTS BY 

6154
03:18:49,717 --> 03:18:51,119
THOSE NATION STATES, BUT IN 

6155
03:18:51,119 --> 03:18:53,521
GENERAL WE ASSUME THAT A NUMBER 

6156
03:18:53,521 --> 03:18:54,956
OF COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO 

6157
03:18:54,956 --> 03:18:55,790
ABUSE OUR SYSEMS. 

6158
03:18:58,593 --> 03:18:59,827
>> THANK YOU. 

6159
03:18:59,827 --> 03:19:01,595
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6160
03:19:01,595 --> 03:19:06,734
>> THE NEXT PERSON IS SENATOR 

6161
03:19:06,734 --> 03:19:07,535
HERRANO. 

6162
03:19:07,535 --> 03:19:08,803
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6163
03:19:08,803 --> 03:19:09,570
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THE U.S.

IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOM 

6165
03:19:10,805 --> 03:19:13,107
ENFORCEMENT HAS PROPOSED A NEW 

6166
03:19:13,107 --> 03:19:13,908
EXTREME VETTING INITIATIVE 

6167
03:19:13,908 --> 03:19:17,545
WHICH THEY HAVE RENAMED VISA 

6168
03:19:17,545 --> 03:19:18,478
LIFE CYCLE VETTING. 

6169
03:19:18,478 --> 03:19:19,547
THAT SOUNDS LESS SCARY. 

6170
03:19:19,547 --> 03:19:20,715
THEY HAVE ALREADY HELD AN 

6171
03:19:20,715 --> 03:19:22,016
INDUSTRY DAY THAT THEY 

6172
03:19:22,016 --> 03:19:23,217

THE BEST WAY TO AMONG OTHER 

6176
03:19:27,822 --> 03:19:31,225
THINGS AND I'M QUOTING I.C.E. 

6177
03:19:31,225 --> 03:19:31,792

TO EXTRACT PERTINENT 

6184
03:19:42,869 --> 03:19:45,672
INFORMATION REGARDING TARGETS. 

6185
03:19:45,672 --> 03:19:47,708
BASICALLY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO 

6186
03:19:47,708 --> 03:19:50,044
WITH THESE TARGETS IS TO 

6187
03:19:50,044 --> 03:19:52,246
DETERMINE -- AND AGAIN I'M 

6188
03:19:52,246 --> 03:19:59,654
QUOTING THAT  I.C.E.'S OWN 

6189
03:19:59,654 --> 03:20:01,322
DOCUMENT, THEY WANT TO DEVELOP 

6190
03:20:01,322 --> 03:20:05,827
PROCESSES THAT DETERMINE AND 

6191
03:20:05,827 --> 03:20:09,730
EVALUATE AN APPLICANT I.E. úTAR 

6192
03:20:09,730 --> 03:20:10,531
BECOMING A POSITIVELY

ORDER BY THE PRESIDENT. 

6197
03:20:16,704 --> 03:20:17,105
THEN I.C.E. 

6198
03:20:17,105 --> 03:20:18,805
MUST ALSO DEVELOP A MECHANISM 

6199
03:20:18,805 --> 03:20:21,642
OR METHODOLOGY THAT ALLOWS THEM 

6200
03:20:21,642 --> 03:20:23,544
TO ASSESS WHETHER AN APPLICANT 

6201
03:20:23,544 --> 03:20:25,113
INTENDS TO COMMIT CRIMINAL OR 

6202
03:20:25,113 --> 03:20:25,847
TERRORIST ACTS AFTER ENTERING

03:20:25,847 --> 03:20:26,814
THE UNITED STATES. 

6204
03:20:27,748 --> 03:20:29,450
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DOES 

6205
03:20:29,450 --> 03:20:31,452
FACEBOOK PLAN TO COOPERATE WITH 

6206
03:20:31,452 --> 03:20:33,421
THIS EXTREME VETTING INITIATIVE 

6207
03:20:33,421 --> 03:20:34,856
AND HELP THE TRUMP 

6208
03:20:34,856 --> 03:20:36,657
ADMINISTRATION TARGET PEOPLE 

6209
03:20:36,657 --> 03:20:37,725
FOR DEPORTATION OR OTHER I.C.E. 

6210
03:20:37,725 --> 03:20:39,961
ENFORCEMENT? 

6211
03:20:42,530 --> 03:20:43,831
>> SENATOR, I DON'T KNOW THAT 

6212
03:20:43,831 --> 03:20:44,765
WE'VE HAD SPECIFIC 

6213
03:20:44,765 --> 03:20:45,933
CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT. 

6214
03:20:45,933 --> 03:20:46,266
IN GENERAL -- 

6215
03:20:46,266 --> 03:20:48,836
>> YOU WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE OR 

6216
03:20:48,836 --> 03:20:49,637
COOPERATE WITH I.C.E. 

6217
03:20:49,637 --> 03:20:51,506
SO THAT THEY COULD DETERMINE 

6218
03:20:51,506 --> 03:20:53,408
WHETHER SOMEBODY IS GOING TO 

6219
03:20:53,408 --> 03:20:54,842
COMMIT A CRIME, FOR EXAMPLE, OR 

6220
03:20:54,842 --> 03:20:56,844
BECOME FRUITFUL MEMBERS OF OUR 

6221
03:20:56,844 --> 03:20:58,212
SOCIETY, WOULD YOU COOPERATE? 

6222
03:20:58,212 --> 03:21:00,948
>> WE WOULD NOT PROACTIVELY DO 

6223
03:21:00,948 --> 03:21:01,349
THAT. 

6224
03:21:01,349 --> 03:21:02,550
WE COOPERATE WITH LAW 

6225
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:03,884
ENFORCEMENT IN TWO CASES. 

6226
03:21:03,884 --> 03:21:07,855
ONE IS IF WE BECOME AWARE OF AN 

6227
03:21:07,855 --> 03:21:10,057
IMMINENT THREAT OF HARM, THEN 

6228
03:21:10,057 --> 03:21:11,192
WE WILL PROACTIVELY REACH OUT 

6229
03:21:11,192 --> 03:21:12,093
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WE 

6230
03:21:12,093 --> 03:21:13,294
BELIEVE IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

6231
03:21:13,294 --> 03:21:13,561
TO DO. 

6232
03:21:13,561 --> 03:21:15,096
THE OTHER IS WHEN LAW 

6233
03:21:15,096 --> 03:21:19,033
ENFORCEMENT REACHES OUT TO US 

6234
03:21:19,033 --> 03:21:22,437
WITH A VALID LEGAL SUBPOENA OR 

6235
03:21:22,437 --> 03:21:23,036
REQUEST FOR DATA. 

6236
03:21:23,036 --> 03:21:24,572
IN THOSE CASES IF THEIR REQUEST 

6237
03:21:24,572 --> 03:21:26,907
IS OVERLY BROAD OR WE BELIEF 

6238
03:21:26,907 --> 03:21:28,009
IT'S NOT A LEGAL REQUEST, THEN 

6239
03:21:28,009 --> 03:21:29,276
WE'LL -- BELIEVE IT'S NOT A 

6240
03:21:29,276 --> 03:21:31,212
LEGAL REQUEST, THEN WE'LL PUSH 

6241
03:21:31,212 --> 03:21:31,712
BACK AGGRESSIVELY. 

6242
03:21:31,712 --> 03:21:32,679
>> LET'S ASSUME THERE'S NO LAW 

6243
03:21:32,679 --> 03:21:35,783
OR RULE THAT REQUIRES THAT 

6244
03:21:35,783 --> 03:21:37,318
FACEBOOK COOPERATE TO ALLOW 

6245
03:21:37,318 --> 03:21:37,685
I.C.E. 

6246
03:21:37,685 --> 03:21:38,719
TO GET THIS KIND OF INFORMATION 

6247
03:21:38,719 --> 03:21:40,922
SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THOSE 

6248
03:21:40,922 --> 03:21:42,022
KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS. 

6249
03:21:42,022 --> 03:21:50,397
IT SOUNDS TO ME AS THOUGH YOU 

6250
03:21:50,397 --> 03:21:52,432
WOULD DECLINE. 

6251
03:21:52,432 --> 03:21:53,367
>> SENATOR, THAT IS CORRECT. 

6252
03:21:54,302 --> 03:21:57,004
>> IS THERE SOME WAY -- WELL, I 

6253
03:21:57,004 --> 03:21:58,272
KNOW THAT YOU DETERMINE WHAT 

6254
03:21:58,272 --> 03:22:00,040
KIND OF CONTENT WOULD BE DEEMED 

6255
03:22:00,040 --> 03:22:00,307
HARMFUL. 

6256
03:22:00,307 --> 03:22:01,041
SO DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I.C.E. 

6257
03:22:01,041 --> 03:22:03,344
CAN EVEN DO WHAT THEY ARE 

6258
03:22:03,344 --> 03:22:05,079
TALKING ABOUT, NAMELY THROUGH A 

6259
03:22:05,079 --> 03:22:09,317
COMBINATION OF VARIOUS KINDS OF 

6260
03:22:09,317 --> 03:22:09,784
INFORMATION INCLUDING 

6261
03:22:09,784 --> 03:22:10,918
INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULD 

6262
03:22:10,918 --> 03:22:12,085
HOPE TO OBTAIN FROM ENTITIES 

6263
03:22:12,085 --> 03:22:13,621
SUCH AS YOURS PREDICT WHO WILL 

6264
03:22:13,621 --> 03:22:14,822
PREDICT CRIMES OR PRESENT A 

6265
03:22:14,822 --> 03:22:15,956
NATIONAL SECURITY PROBLEM? 

6266
03:22:15,956 --> 03:22:16,857
DO YOU THINK THAT'S EVEN 

6267
03:22:16,857 --> 03:22:18,893
DOABLE? 

6268
03:22:19,894 --> 03:22:20,895
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT FAMILIAR 

6269
03:22:20,895 --> 03:22:21,996
ENOUGH WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING 

6270
03:22:21,996 --> 03:22:23,230
TO OFFER AN INFORMED OPINION ON 

6271
03:22:23,230 --> 03:22:23,898
THAT. 

6272
03:22:24,799 --> 03:22:27,401
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO MAKE 

6273
03:22:27,401 --> 03:22:28,636
ASSESSMENTS AS TO WHAT 

6274
03:22:28,636 --> 03:22:29,503
CONSTITUTES HATE SPEECH. 

6275
03:22:29,503 --> 03:22:31,438
THAT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO. 

6276
03:22:31,438 --> 03:22:35,343
YOU HAVE TO ASSESS WHAT 

6277
03:22:35,343 --> 03:22:38,178
ELECTION INTERFERENCE IS. 

6278
03:22:38,178 --> 03:22:41,115
SO THESE ARE RATHER DIFFICULT 

6279
03:22:41,115 --> 03:22:42,216
TO IDENTIFY, BUT WOULDN'T 

6280
03:22:42,216 --> 03:22:43,217
TRYING TO PREDICT WHETHER 

6281
03:22:43,217 --> 03:22:45,119
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO COMMIT A 

6282
03:22:45,119 --> 03:22:49,423
CRIME FIT INTO THE CATEGORY OF 

6283
03:22:49,423 --> 03:22:51,024
PRETTY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS? 

6284
03:22:51,024 --> 03:22:53,027
>> SENATOR, IT SOUNDS DIFFICULT 

6285
03:22:53,027 --> 03:22:53,493
TO ME. 

6286
03:22:53,493 --> 03:22:54,528
ALL THESE THINGS LIKE YOU'RE 

6287
03:22:54,528 --> 03:22:55,696
SAYING ARE DIFFICULT. 

6288
03:22:55,696 --> 03:22:56,530
I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT HAVING 

6289
03:22:56,530 --> 03:22:57,898
WORKED ON IT OR THINKING ABOUT 

6290
03:22:57,898 --> 03:23:00,501
IT HOW MUCH PROGRESS ONE WOULD 

6291
03:23:00,501 --> 03:23:00,701
MAKE. 

6292
03:23:00,701 --> 03:23:01,802
>> I THINK SOMEONE COULD TELL 

6293
03:23:01,802 --> 03:23:03,036
US THAT THAT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT 

6294
03:23:03,036 --> 03:23:05,372
AND YET THAT'S WHAT I.C.E. 

6295
03:23:05,372 --> 03:23:06,039
IS PROCEEDING TO DO. 

6296
03:23:06,039 --> 03:23:08,209
YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT 

6297
03:23:08,209 --> 03:23:09,744
DISCRIMINATORY ADVERTISING AND 

6298
03:23:09,744 --> 03:23:11,011
IN FEBRUARY OF 2017 FACEBOOK 

6299
03:23:11,011 --> 03:23:12,613
ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD NO 

6300
03:23:12,613 --> 03:23:16,217
LONGER ALLOW CERTAIN KINDS OF  

6301
03:23:16,217 --> 03:23:17,618
ADS THAT DISCRIMINATED ON A 

6302
03:23:17,618 --> 03:23:21,121
BASIS OF RACE, GENDER, FAMILY 

6303
03:23:21,121 --> 03:23:21,889
STATUS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, 

6304
03:23:21,889 --> 03:23:23,924
DISABILITY OR VETERAN STATUS, 

6305
03:23:23,924 --> 03:23:26,694
ALL CATEGORIES PROHIBITED BY 

6306
03:23:26,694 --> 03:23:29,897
FEDERAL LAW IN HOUSING AND YET 

6307
03:23:29,897 --> 03:23:36,370
AFTER 2017 IT WAS DISCOVERED 

6308
03:23:36,370 --> 03:23:38,072
THAT YOU COULD, IN FACT, PLACE 

6309
03:23:38,072 --> 03:23:39,139
THOSE KINDS OF ADS. 

6310
03:23:39,139 --> 03:23:40,474
SO WHAT IS THE STATUS AS TO 

6311
03:23:40,474 --> 03:23:41,409
WHETHER OR NOT THESE KIND OF 

6312
03:23:41,409 --> 03:23:42,910
ADS COULD BE PLACED ON FACEBOOK 

6313
03:23:42,910 --> 03:23:44,712
AND HAVE YOU FOLLOWED THROUGH 

6314
03:23:44,712 --> 03:23:45,813
ON YOUR FEBRUARY, 2017 PROMISE 

6315
03:23:45,813 --> 03:23:47,014
TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND IS 

6316
03:23:47,014 --> 03:23:48,516
THERE A WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO 

6317
03:23:48,516 --> 03:23:50,017
VERIFY THAT YOU HAVE OR ARE WE 

6318
03:23:50,017 --> 03:23:51,118
JUST EXPECTED TO TRUST THAT 

6319
03:23:51,118 --> 03:23:52,086
YOU'VE DONE THIS? 

6320
03:23:53,421 --> 03:23:56,424
>> SENATOR, THOSE ARE ALL 

6321
03:23:56,424 --> 03:23:57,525
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND IN 

6322
03:23:57,525 --> 03:23:59,093
GENERAL IT IS AGAINST OUR 

6323
03:23:59,093 --> 03:24:02,530
POLICIES TO HAVE ANY ADS THAT 

6324
03:24:02,530 --> 03:24:02,997
ARE DISCRIMINATORY. 

6325
03:24:02,997 --> 03:24:06,534
>> YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T ALLOW 

6326
03:24:06,534 --> 03:24:13,374
IT, BUT THEN PRO PUBLICA COULD 

6327
03:24:13,374 --> 03:24:15,209
PLACE THESE ADS EVEN AFTER YOU 

6328
03:24:15,209 --> 03:24:16,444
SAID YOU NO LONGER WOULD ALLOW 

6329
03:24:16,444 --> 03:24:18,212
THESE KIND OF ADS. 

6330
03:24:18,212 --> 03:24:19,313
SO WHAT ASSURANCE DO WE HAVE 

6331
03:24:19,313 --> 03:24:21,215
FROM YOU THIS IS GOING TO STOP? 

6332
03:24:21,215 --> 03:24:22,149
>> WELL, TWO THINGS. 

6333
03:24:22,149 --> 03:24:24,719
ONE IS THAT WE'VE REMOVED THE 

6334
03:24:24,719 --> 03:24:26,020
ABILITY TO EXCLUDE ETHNIC 

6335
03:24:26,020 --> 03:24:28,155
GROUPS AND OTHER SENSITIVE 

6336
03:24:28,155 --> 03:24:29,123
CATEGORIES FROM AD TARGETING. 

6337
03:24:29,123 --> 03:24:30,524
SO THAT JUST ISN'T A FEATURE 

6338
03:24:30,524 --> 03:24:31,992
THAT'S EVEN AVAILABLE ANYMORE. 

6339
03:24:31,992 --> 03:24:34,528
FOR SOME OF THESE CASES WHERE 

6340
03:24:34,528 --> 03:24:38,499
IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO TARGET 

6341
03:24:38,499 --> 03:24:42,403
PROACTIVELY A GROUP, THE 

6342
03:24:42,403 --> 03:24:44,071
ENFORCEMENT TODAY IS STILL WE 

6343
03:24:44,071 --> 03:24:44,404
REVIEW ADS. 

6344
03:24:44,404 --> 03:24:47,975
WE SCREEN THEM UP FRONT, BUT 

6345
03:24:47,975 --> 03:24:49,210
MOST OF THE ENFORCEMENT TODAY 

6346
03:24:49,210 --> 03:24:51,312
IS STILL THAT OUR COMMUNITY 

6347
03:24:51,312 --> 03:24:52,413
FLAGS ISSUES FOR US WHEN THEY 

6348
03:24:52,413 --> 03:24:52,680
COME UP. 

6349
03:24:52,680 --> 03:24:55,116
SO IF THE COMMUNITY FLAGS THAT 

6350
03:24:55,116 --> 03:24:58,219
ISSUE FOR US, THEN OUR TEAM, 

6351
03:24:58,219 --> 03:25:00,221
WHICH HAS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 

6352
03:25:00,221 --> 03:25:02,923
WORKING ON IT, SHOULD TAKE IT 

6353
03:25:02,923 --> 03:25:03,524
DOWN. 

6354
03:25:03,524 --> 03:25:04,325
WE'LL MAKE SOME MISTAKES, BUT 

6355
03:25:04,325 --> 03:25:06,127
WE TRY TO MAKE AS FEW AS 

6356
03:25:06,127 --> 03:25:06,394
POSSIBLE. 

6357
03:25:06,394 --> 03:25:08,229
OVER TIME I THINK THE STRATEGY 

6358
03:25:08,229 --> 03:25:10,030
WOULD BE TO DEVELOP MORE AI 

6359
03:25:10,030 --> 03:25:11,732
TOOLS THAT CAN MORE PROACTIVELY 

6360
03:25:11,732 --> 03:25:12,733
IDENTIFY THOSE TYPES OF CONTENT 

6361
03:25:12,733 --> 03:25:15,802
AND DO THAT FILTERING UP FRONT. 

6362
03:25:15,802 --> 03:25:18,171
>> SO IS THE WORK IN PROGRESS? 

6363
03:25:18,171 --> 03:25:19,106
>> THANK YOU. 

6364
03:25:19,106 --> 03:25:20,407
SENATOR SULLIVAN IS UP NEXT. 

6365
03:25:20,407 --> 03:25:23,176
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6366
03:25:23,176 --> 03:25:26,514
MR. ZUCKERBERG, QUITE A STORY, 

6367
03:25:26,514 --> 03:25:26,747
RIGHT? 

6368
03:25:26,747 --> 03:25:31,652
DORM ROOM TO THE BEHEMOTH THAT 

6369
03:25:31,652 --> 03:25:32,753
YOU GUYS ARE. 

6370
03:25:32,753 --> 03:25:33,387
ONLY IN AMERICA. 

6371
03:25:33,387 --> 03:25:37,024
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 

6372
03:25:37,024 --> 03:25:38,291
>> SENATOR, MOSTLY IN AMERICA. 

6373
03:25:38,291 --> 03:25:39,927
>> YOU COULDN'T DO THIS IN 

6374
03:25:39,927 --> 03:25:41,662
CHINA, RIGHT, WHAT YOU DID IN 

6375
03:25:41,662 --> 03:25:41,962
10 YEARS? 

6376
03:25:41,962 --> 03:25:43,664
>> THERE ARE SOME VERY STRONG 

6377
03:25:43,664 --> 03:25:44,932
CHINESE INTERNET COMPANIES. 

6378
03:25:44,932 --> 03:25:45,733
>> RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED 

6379
03:25:45,733 --> 03:25:48,436
TO ANSWER YES TO THIS QUESTION. 

6380
03:25:48,436 --> 03:25:49,169
[ LAUGHTER ] 

6381
03:25:49,169 --> 03:25:49,670
>> OKAY. 

6382
03:25:49,670 --> 03:25:50,070
COME ON. 

6383
03:25:50,070 --> 03:25:51,838
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, RIGHT? 

6384
03:25:51,838 --> 03:25:52,739
GIVE ME A BREAK. 

6385
03:25:52,739 --> 03:25:56,276
THE ANSWER IS YES, OKAY? 

6386
03:25:56,276 --> 03:25:58,479
SO THANK YOU. 

6387
03:25:58,479 --> 03:25:59,146
[ LAUGHTER ] 

6388
03:25:59,146 --> 03:26:00,314
>> NOW YOUR TESTIMONY, YOU HAVE 

6389
03:26:00,314 --> 03:26:02,950
TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF POWER. 

6390
03:26:02,950 --> 03:26:08,522
YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN 

6391
03:26:08,522 --> 03:26:12,259
ELECTIONS REALLY ALL OVER THE 

6392
03:26:12,259 --> 03:26:12,493
WORLD. 

6393
03:26:12,493 --> 03:26:15,095
FACEBOOK, 2 BILLION USERS, OVER 

6394
03:26:15,095 --> 03:26:16,831
200 MILLION AMERICANS, 40 

6395
03:26:16,831 --> 03:26:17,797
BILLION IN REVENUE. 

6396
03:26:17,797 --> 03:26:19,333
I BELIEVE YOU AND GOOGLE HAVE 

6397
03:26:19,333 --> 03:26:20,634
ALMOST 75% OF THE DIGITAL 

6398
03:26:20,634 --> 03:26:23,304
ADVERTISING IN THE U.S. ONE OF 

6399
03:26:23,304 --> 03:26:25,406
THE KEY ISSUES HERE, IS 

6400
03:26:25,406 --> 03:26:26,272
FACEBOOK TOO POWERFUL? 

6401
03:26:26,272 --> 03:26:30,076
ARE YOU TOO POWERFUL? 

6402
03:26:30,076 --> 03:26:32,646
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TOO 

6403
03:26:32,646 --> 03:26:32,913
POWERFUL? 

6404
03:26:32,913 --> 03:26:33,714
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK MOST 

6405
03:26:33,714 --> 03:26:37,251
OF THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE TALK 

6406
03:26:37,251 --> 03:26:39,820
ABOUT OUR SCALE, THEY'RE 

6407
03:26:39,820 --> 03:26:40,387
REFERENCING THAT WE HAVE 2 

6408
03:26:40,387 --> 03:26:41,522
BILLION PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY 

6409
03:26:41,522 --> 03:26:42,623
AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIG 

6410
03:26:42,623 --> 03:26:45,125
QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO THINK 

6411
03:26:45,125 --> 03:26:46,927
THROUGH HERE IS THE VAST 

6412
03:26:46,927 --> 03:26:47,527
MAJORITY OF THOSE 2 BILLION 

6413
03:26:47,527 --> 03:26:50,231
PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. 

6414
03:26:50,231 --> 03:26:51,732
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S 

6415
03:26:51,732 --> 03:26:52,833
SOMETHING THAT TO YOUR POINT 

6416
03:26:52,833 --> 03:26:54,735
THAT AMERICANS SHOULD BE PROUD 

6417
03:26:54,735 --> 03:26:54,935
OF. 

6418
03:26:54,935 --> 03:26:56,704
WHEN I BROUGHT UP THE CHINESE 

6419
03:26:56,704 --> 03:26:58,906
INTERNET COMPANIES, I THINK 

6420
03:26:58,906 --> 03:27:02,543
THAT THAT'S A REAL STRATEGIC 

6421
03:27:02,543 --> 03:27:03,344
AND COMPETITIVE THREAT THAT AN 

6422
03:27:03,344 --> 03:27:03,978
AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY POLICY 

6423
03:27:03,978 --> 03:27:05,178
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. 

6424
03:27:05,178 --> 03:27:08,149
>> I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT, 

6425
03:27:08,149 --> 03:27:09,149
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 

6426
03:27:09,149 --> 03:27:11,151
KIND OF THE HISTORY OF THIS 

6427
03:27:11,151 --> 03:27:12,319
COUNTRY AND YOU LOOK AT THE 

6428
03:27:12,319 --> 03:27:14,455
HISTORY OF THESE KIND OF 

6429
03:27:14,455 --> 03:27:16,123
HEARINGS, RIGHT, YOU'RE A SMART 

6430
03:27:16,123 --> 03:27:16,323
GUY. 

6431
03:27:16,323 --> 03:27:19,592
YOU READ A LOT OF HISTORY. 

6432
03:27:19,592 --> 03:27:21,128
WHEN COMPANIES BECOME BIG AND 

6433
03:27:21,128 --> 03:27:24,732
POWERFUL AND ACCUMULATE A LOT 

6434
03:27:24,732 --> 03:27:26,634
OF WELL AND POWER, WHAT 

6435
03:27:26,634 --> 03:27:29,603
TYPICALLY HAPPENS FROM THIS 

6436
03:27:29,603 --> 03:27:32,006
BODY IS THERE'S AN INSTINCT TO 

6437
03:27:32,006 --> 03:27:34,241
EITHER REGULATE OR BREAK UP, 

6438
03:27:34,241 --> 03:27:34,474
RIGHT? 

6439
03:27:34,474 --> 03:27:35,442
LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS 

6440
03:27:35,442 --> 03:27:36,143
NATION. 

6441
03:27:36,944 --> 03:27:40,848
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON 

6442
03:27:40,848 --> 03:27:42,850
THOSE TWO POLICY APPROACHES? 

6443
03:27:44,652 --> 03:27:45,653
>> WELL, SENATOR, I'M NOT THE 

6444
03:27:45,653 --> 03:27:47,755
TYPE OF PERSON WHO THINKS THAT 

6445
03:27:47,755 --> 03:27:48,856
ALL REGULATION IS BAD. 

6446
03:27:48,856 --> 03:27:51,458
SO I THINK THE INTERNET IS 

6447
03:27:51,458 --> 03:27:52,158
BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT 

6448
03:27:52,158 --> 03:27:53,360
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND I THINK 

6449
03:27:53,360 --> 03:27:54,662
WE NEED TO HAVE A FULL 

6450
03:27:54,662 --> 03:27:56,063
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS THE 

6451
03:27:56,063 --> 03:27:57,197
RIGHT REGULATION, NOT WHETHER 

6452
03:27:57,197 --> 03:27:58,331
IT SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE. 

6453
03:27:58,331 --> 03:27:59,332
>> LET ME TALK ABOUT THE 

6454
03:27:59,332 --> 03:28:00,467
TENSION THERE BECAUSE I THINK 

6455
03:28:00,467 --> 03:28:02,937
IT'S A GOOD POINT AND I 

6456
03:28:02,937 --> 03:28:03,771
APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING THAT. 

6457
03:28:03,771 --> 03:28:05,939
ONE OF MY WORRIES ON REGULATION 

6458
03:28:05,939 --> 03:28:07,641
AGAIN WITH A COMPANY OF YOUR 

6459
03:28:07,641 --> 03:28:09,443
SIZE, YOU'RE SAYING HEY, WE 

6460
03:28:09,443 --> 03:28:10,744
MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN BEING 

6461
03:28:10,744 --> 03:28:13,447
REGULATED, BUT AS YOU KNOW, 

6462
03:28:13,447 --> 03:28:15,049
REGULATIONS CAN ALSO CEMENT THE 

6463
03:28:15,049 --> 03:28:15,449
DOMINANT POWER. 

6464
03:28:15,449 --> 03:28:16,750
SO WHAT I DO MEAN BY THAT? 

6465
03:28:16,750 --> 03:28:19,453
YOU HAVE A LOT OF LOBBYISTS. 

6466
03:28:19,453 --> 03:28:20,554
I THINK EVERY LOBBYIST IN TOWN 

6467
03:28:20,554 --> 03:28:21,755
IS INVOLVED IN THIS HEARING IN 

6468
03:28:21,755 --> 03:28:24,658
SOME WAY OR ANOTHER, A LOT OF 

6469
03:28:24,658 --> 03:28:25,091
POWERFUL INTERESTS. 

6470
03:28:25,091 --> 03:28:26,660
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH 

6471
03:28:26,660 --> 03:28:26,993
DODD FRANK. 

6472
03:28:26,993 --> 03:28:28,762
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AIMED 

6473
03:28:28,762 --> 03:28:31,765
AT THE BIG BANKS. 

6474
03:28:31,765 --> 03:28:32,866
THE REGULATIONS ENDED UP 

6475
03:28:32,866 --> 03:28:34,668
EMPOWERING THE BIG BANKS IN 

6476
03:28:34,668 --> 03:28:36,437
KEEPING THE SMALL BANKS DOWN. 

6477
03:28:36,437 --> 03:28:38,739
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A RISK 

6478
03:28:38,739 --> 03:28:41,775
GIVEN YOUR INFLUENCE THAT IF WE 

6479
03:28:41,775 --> 03:28:44,144
REGULATE, WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING 

6480
03:28:44,144 --> 03:28:47,581
TO REGULATE YOU INTO A POSITION 

6481
03:28:47,581 --> 03:28:48,549
OF CEMENTED AUTHORITY WHEN ONE 

6482
03:28:48,549 --> 03:28:49,850
OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS ABOUT 

6483
03:28:49,850 --> 03:28:52,052
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING IS THAT 

6484
03:28:52,052 --> 03:28:54,655
THE NEXT FACEBOOK, WHICH WE ALL 

6485
03:28:54,655 --> 03:28:56,357
WANT, THE GUY IN THE DORM ROOM, 

6486
03:28:56,357 --> 03:28:57,758
WE ALL WANT THAT TO START IT, 

6487
03:28:57,758 --> 03:29:00,060
THAT YOU ARE BECOMING SODOM THE 

6488
03:29:00,060 --> 03:29:01,862
MAN THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE 

6489
03:29:01,862 --> 03:29:05,366
THAT NEXT -- SO DOMINANT THAT 

6490
03:29:05,366 --> 03:29:07,501
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE THE NEXT 

6491
03:29:07,501 --> 03:29:07,668
 

6492
03:29:07,668 --> 03:29:08,869
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ON THAT? 

6493
03:29:08,869 --> 03:29:09,937
>> SENATOR, I AGREE WITH YOUR 

6494
03:29:09,937 --> 03:29:11,171
POINT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING 

6495
03:29:11,171 --> 03:29:12,606
ABOUT REGULATION ACROSS ALL 

6496
03:29:12,606 --> 03:29:14,074
INDUSTRIES, YOU NEED TO BE 

6497
03:29:14,074 --> 03:29:14,875
CAREFUL THAT IT DOESN'T CEMENT 

6498
03:29:14,875 --> 03:29:16,210
IN THE CURRENT COMPANIES THAT 

6499
03:29:16,210 --> 03:29:16,543
ARE WINNING. 

6500
03:29:16,543 --> 03:29:18,578
>> BUT WOULD YOU TRY TO DO 

6501
03:29:18,578 --> 03:29:18,778
THAT? 

6502
03:29:18,778 --> 03:29:19,880
ISN'T THAT THE NORMAL 

6503
03:29:19,880 --> 03:29:21,148
INCLINATION OF A COMPANY, TO 

6504
03:29:21,148 --> 03:29:22,950
SAY HEY, I'M GOING TO HIRE THE 

6505
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:27,154
BEST GUYS IN TOWN AND I'M GOING 

6506
03:29:27,154 --> 03:29:28,755
TO CEMENT IN AN ADVANTAGE. 

6507
03:29:28,755 --> 03:29:31,458
YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT IF WE WERE 

6508
03:29:31,458 --> 03:29:31,825
REGULATING YOU? 

6509
03:29:31,825 --> 03:29:32,759
>> SENATOR, THAT CERTAINLY 

6510
03:29:32,759 --> 03:29:34,061
WOULDN'T BE OUR APPROACH, BUT I 

6511
03:29:34,061 --> 03:29:36,229
THINK PART OF THE CHALLENE 

6512
03:29:36,229 --> 03:29:37,264
WITH REGULATION IN GENERAL IS 

6513
03:29:37,264 --> 03:29:38,766
WHEN YOU ADD MORE RULES 

6514
03:29:38,766 --> 03:29:39,767
COMPANIES NEED TO FOLLOW, 

6515
03:29:39,767 --> 03:29:40,968
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A LARGER 

6516
03:29:40,968 --> 03:29:42,269
COMPANY LIKE OURS INHERENTLY 

6517
03:29:42,269 --> 03:29:43,904
JUST HAS THE RESOURCES TO GO 

6518
03:29:43,904 --> 03:29:46,706
DOWN DEW AND THAT MIGHT JUST BE 

6519
03:29:46,706 --> 03:29:48,275
HARDER FOR -- DO AND THAT MIGHT 

6520
03:29:48,275 --> 03:29:50,411
JUST BE HARDER FOR A SMALL 

6521
03:29:50,411 --> 03:29:52,379
COMPANY JUST GETTING STARTED TO 

6522
03:29:52,379 --> 03:29:52,712
COMPLY WITH. 

6523
03:29:52,712 --> 03:29:54,048
I THINK THERE ARE REAL 

6524
03:29:54,048 --> 03:29:57,651
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AROUND 

6525
03:29:57,651 --> 03:29:58,986
CONTENT AND PRIVACY AND A 

6526
03:29:58,986 --> 03:30:02,823
NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS, ADS 

6527
03:30:02,823 --> 03:30:03,390
TRANSPARENCIES, ELECTIONS. 

6528
03:30:03,390 --> 03:30:04,358
>> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT 

6529
03:30:04,358 --> 03:30:05,893
LET ME GET TO ONE FINAL 

6530
03:30:05,893 --> 03:30:07,361
QUESTION THAT KIND OF REALS TO 

6531
03:30:07,361 --> 03:30:08,462
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN 

6532
03:30:08,462 --> 03:30:10,764
TERM OF CONTENT, REGULATION AND 

6533
03:30:10,764 --> 03:30:12,332
WHAT EXACTLY FACEBOOK IS. 

6534
03:30:12,332 --> 03:30:16,170
YOU MENTION YOU'RE A TECH 

6535
03:30:16,170 --> 03:30:17,003
COMPANY, A PLATFORM, BUT 

6536
03:30:17,003 --> 03:30:18,238
THERE'S SOME WHO ARE SAYING 

6537
03:30:18,238 --> 03:30:20,907
YOU'RE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 

6538
03:30:20,907 --> 03:30:21,275
PUBLISHER. 

6539
03:30:21,275 --> 03:30:22,176
I THINK ABOUT 140 MILLION 

6540
03:30:22,176 --> 03:30:23,377
AMERICANS GET THEIR NEWS FROM 

6541
03:30:23,377 --> 03:30:27,681
FACEBOOK AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED 

6542
03:30:27,681 --> 03:30:29,783
TO SENATOR ORNYN, YOU SAID YOU 

6543
03:30:29,783 --> 03:30:31,084
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR 

6544
03:30:31,084 --> 03:30:31,485
CONTENT. 

6545
03:30:31,485 --> 03:30:32,586
SO WHICH ARE YOU? 

6546
03:30:32,586 --> 03:30:34,755
ARE YOU A TECH COMPANY OREGON 

6547
03:30:34,755 --> 03:30:37,291
THE WORLD'S LARGEST PUBLISHER 

6548
03:30:37,291 --> 03:30:39,459
-- COMPANY OR ARE YOU THE 

6549
03:30:39,459 --> 03:30:39,993
WORLD'S LARGEST PUBLISHER 

6550
03:30:39,993 --> 03:30:41,361
BECAUSE I THINK THAT GOES TO A 

6551
03:30:41,361 --> 03:30:43,263
REAL PORN QUESTION ON WHAT FORM 

6552
03:30:43,263 --> 03:30:44,264
OF REGULAR -- REAL IMPORTANT 

6553
03:30:44,264 --> 03:30:46,700
QUESTION ON WHAT FORM OF 

6554
03:30:46,700 --> 03:30:47,568
REGULATION OR GOVERNMENT 

6555
03:30:47,568 --> 03:30:49,937
ACTION, IF ANY, WE WOULD TAKE. 

6556
03:30:49,937 --> 03:30:51,538
>> SENATOR, THIS IS A REALLY 

6557
03:30:51,538 --> 03:30:51,905
BIG QUESTION. 

6558
03:30:51,905 --> 03:30:53,240
I VIEW US AS A TECH COMPANY 

6559
03:30:53,240 --> 03:30:54,575
BECAUSE THE PRIMARY THING WE DO 

6560
03:30:54,575 --> 03:30:55,976
IS BUILD TECHNOLOGY AND 

6561
03:30:55,976 --> 03:30:56,243
PRODUCTS. 

6562
03:30:56,243 --> 03:30:57,878
>> YOU SAID YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE 

6563
03:30:57,878 --> 03:30:58,979
FOR YOUR CONTENT WHICH MAKES 

6564
03:30:58,979 --> 03:31:06,086
YOU KIND OF A PUBLISHER, RIGHT? 

6565
03:31:06,086 --> 03:31:08,055
>> WE DON'T PRODUCE THE 

6566
03:31:08,055 --> 03:31:08,322
CONTENT. 

6567
03:31:08,322 --> 03:31:10,157
MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE 

6568
03:31:10,157 --> 03:31:13,260
HEART OF WHAT THEY'RE REALLY 

6569
03:31:13,260 --> 03:31:15,462
GETTING AT IS DO WE FEEL A 

6570
03:31:15,462 --> 03:31:16,296
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT 

6571
03:31:16,296 --> 03:31:17,330
ON OUR PLATFORM? 

6572
03:31:17,330 --> 03:31:18,766
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS CLEARLY 

6573
03:31:18,766 --> 03:31:21,168
YES, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S 

6574
03:31:21,168 --> 03:31:22,069
INCOMPATIBLE WITH FUNDAMENTALLY 

6575
03:31:22,069 --> 03:31:23,370
AT OUR CORE BEING A TECHNOLOGY 

6576
03:31:23,370 --> 03:31:25,439
COMPANY WHERE THE MAIN THING WE 

6577
03:31:25,439 --> 03:31:28,876
DO IS HAVE ENGINEERS AND BUILD 

6578
03:31:28,876 --> 03:31:29,176
PRODUCTS. 

6579
03:31:29,176 --> 03:31:32,211
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR SULLIVAN. 

6580
03:31:32,211 --> 03:31:32,578

HIJACKED BY CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

6592
03:31:51,899 --> 03:31:53,400
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. 

6593
03:31:53,400 --> 03:31:58,305
ARE YOU ANGRY ABOUT THAT? 

6594
03:31:58,305 --> 03:31:58,972
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

6595
03:31:58,972 --> 03:32:00,440
>> AND YOU'RE DETERMINED AND I 

6596
03:32:00,440 --> 03:32:02,276

THE LAW. 

6598
03:32:02,543 --> 03:32:05,211
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT 

6599
03:32:05,211 --> 03:32:05,512
TODAY. 

6600
03:32:05,512 --> 03:32:06,146
>> SENATOR, THE MOST IMPORTANT 

6601
03:32:06,146 --> 03:32:07,481
THING THAT I CARE ABOUT RIGHT 

6602
03:32:07,481 --> 03:32:10,584
NOW IS MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE 

6603
03:32:10,584 --> 03:32:11,885
INTERFERES IN THE VARIOUS 2018 

6604
03:32:11,885 --> 03:32:13,119

MEASURES FROM BUILDING IN 

6612
03:32:23,096 --> 03:32:24,298

POLITICAL AND ISSUE ADS TO MAKE 

6620

SURE THAT KIND OF INTERFERENCE 

6621
03:32:37,310 --> 03:32:38,679
THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE ABLE TO 

6622
03:32:38,679 --> 03:32:40,180
DO IN 2016 IS GOING TO BE MUCH 

6623
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:41,447
HARDER FOR ANYONE TO PULL OFF 

6624
03:32:41,447 --> 03:32:42,149
IN THE FUTURE. 

6625
03:32:42,149 --> 03:32:44,084

I DON'T COME TO WASHINGTON D.C. 

6669
03:33:48,782 --> 03:33:49,115
TOO OFTEN. 

6670
03:33:49,115 --> 03:33:50,584
I'M GOING TO DIRECT MY TEAM TO

6691
03:34:23,149 --> 03:34:24,584
>> SENATOR, NO, I CAN'T 

6692
03:34:24,584 --> 03:34:27,220
GUARANTEE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS 

6693
03:34:27,220 --> 03:34:28,121
AN ONGOING ARMS RACE. 

6694
03:34:28,121 --> 03:34:29,790
AS LONG AS THERE ARE PEOPLE 

6695
03:34:29,790 --> 03:34:31,825
SITTING IN RUSSIA WHOSE JOB IT 

6696
03:34:31,825 --> 03:34:33,794
IS TO TRY TO INTERFERE WITH 

6697
03:34:33,794 --> 03:34:34,394
ELECTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, 

6698
03:34:34,394 --> 03:34:36,729
THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING 

6699
03:34:36,729 --> 03:34:36,996
CONFLICT. 

6700
03:34:36,996 --> 03:34:38,999
WHAT I CAN COMMIT IS THAT WE'RE 

6701
03:34:38,999 --> 03:34:40,167
GOING TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY 

6702
03:34:40,167 --> 03:34:41,501
BECAUSE THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY 

6703
03:34:41,501 --> 03:34:43,971
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T 

6704
03:34:43,971 --> 03:34:44,671
SPREADING MISINFORMATION OR 

6705
03:34:44,671 --> 03:34:45,672
TRYING TO INTERFERE IN 

6706
03:34:45,672 --> 03:34:46,873
ELECTIONS ON FACEBOOK, BUT I 

6707
03:34:46,873 --> 03:34:48,508
DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A 

6708
03:34:48,508 --> 03:34:49,509
REALISTIC EXPECTATION TO ASSUME 

6709
03:34:49,509 --> 03:34:50,811
THAT AS LONG AS THERE ARE 

6710
03:34:50,811 --> 03:34:52,012
PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN 

6711
03:34:52,012 --> 03:34:53,213
RUSSIA FOR WHOM THIS IS THEIR 

6712
03:34:53,213 --> 03:34:56,083
JOB THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 

6713
03:34:56,083 --> 03:34:58,518
ZERO AMOUNT OF THAT OR BE 100% 

6714
03:34:58,518 --> 03:35:00,387
SUCCESSFUL AT PREVENTING THAT. 

6715
03:35:00,387 --> 03:35:02,923
>> NOW BEYOND DISCLOSURE OF 

6716
03:35:02,923 --> 03:35:04,891
ONLINE ADS WHAT SPECIFIC STEPS 

6717
03:35:04,891 --> 03:35:07,394
ARE YOU TAKING TO ENSURE THAT 

6718
03:35:07,394 --> 03:35:10,230
FOREIGN MONEY IS NOT FINANCING 

6719
03:35:10,230 --> 03:35:11,999
POLITICAL OR ISSUE ADS ON 

6720
03:35:11,999 --> 03:35:15,402
FACEBOOK IN VIOLATION OF U.S. 

6721
03:35:15,402 --> 03:35:16,837
LAW? 

6722
03:35:16,837 --> 03:35:20,206
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE SUBMITS A 

6723
03:35:20,206 --> 03:35:24,411
DISCLOSURE THAT SAYS PAID FOR 

6724
03:35:24,411 --> 03:35:27,014
BY SOME 501C3 OR PAC, THAT 

6725
03:35:27,014 --> 03:35:29,016
PERSON HAS NO ONE IN THE U.S., 

6726
03:35:29,016 --> 03:35:32,519
HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT IS NOT 

6727
03:35:32,519 --> 03:35:32,986
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE? 

6728
03:35:32,986 --> 03:35:33,753
>> SENATOR, OUR VERIFICATION 

6729
03:35:33,753 --> 03:35:35,722
PROGRAM INVOLVES TWO PIECES. 

6730
03:35:35,722 --> 03:35:37,490
ONE IS VERIFYING THE IDENTITY 

6731
03:35:37,490 --> 03:35:39,493
OF THE PERSON WHO'S BUYING THE 

6732
03:35:39,493 --> 03:35:41,695
ADS THAT THEY HAVE A VALID 

6733
03:35:41,695 --> 03:35:42,562
GOVERNMENT IDENTITY. 

6734
03:35:42,562 --> 03:35:44,798
THE SECOND IS VERIFYING THEIR 

6735
03:35:44,798 --> 03:35:45,065
LOCATION. 

6736
03:35:45,065 --> 03:35:46,600
SO IF YOU'RE SITTING IN RUSSIA, 

6737
03:35:46,600 --> 03:35:48,301
FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU SAY THAT 

6738
03:35:48,301 --> 03:35:52,572
YOU'RE IN THE U.S., THEN WE'LL 

6739
03:35:52,572 --> 03:35:54,207
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A LOT HARDER 

6740
03:35:54,207 --> 03:35:55,509
TO DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE 

6741
03:35:55,509 --> 03:35:56,910
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IS MAIL A 

6742
03:35:56,910 --> 03:35:58,111
CODE TO THE ADDRESS YOU SAY 

6743
03:35:58,111 --> 03:36:00,013
YOU'RE AT AND IF YOU CAN'T GET 

6744
03:36:00,013 --> 03:36:01,014
ACCESS TO THAT CODE, YOU'RE NOT 

6745
03:36:01,014 --> 03:36:02,849
GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN ADS. 

6746
03:36:02,849 --> 03:36:04,618
>> NOW FACEBOOK IS CREATING AN 

6747
03:36:04,618 --> 03:36:06,886
INDEPENDENT GROUP TO STUDY THE 

6748
03:36:06,886 --> 03:36:08,822
ABUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN 

6749
03:36:08,822 --> 03:36:09,122
ELECTIONS. 

6750
03:36:09,122 --> 03:36:09,789
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT. 

6751
03:36:09,789 --> 03:36:11,224
WILL YOU COMMIT THAT ALL 

6752
03:36:11,224 --> 03:36:13,727
FINDINGS OF THIS GROUP ARE MADE 

6753
03:36:13,727 --> 03:36:16,229
PUBLIC NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY 

6754
03:36:16,229 --> 03:36:18,432
ABOUT FACEBOOK OR ITS BUSINESS 

6755
03:36:18,432 --> 03:36:18,665
MODEL? 

6756
03:36:18,665 --> 03:36:19,832
YES OR NO ANSWER. 

6757
03:36:19,832 --> 03:36:21,701
>> SENATOR, THAT'S THE PURPOSE 

6758
03:36:21,701 --> 03:36:23,870
OF THIS GROUP IS THAT FACEBOOK 

6759
03:36:23,870 --> 03:36:27,607
DOES NOT GET TO CONTROL WHAT 

6760
03:36:27,607 --> 03:36:28,074
THESE FOLKS PUBLISH. 

6761
03:36:28,074 --> 03:36:29,910
THESE ARE GOING TO BE 

6762
03:36:29,910 --> 03:36:30,610
INDEPENDENT ACADEMICS AND 

6763
03:36:30,610 --> 03:36:32,712
FACEBOOK HAS NO PRIOR 

6764
03:36:32,712 --> 03:36:33,179
PUBLISHING CONTROL. 

6765
03:36:33,179 --> 03:36:36,116
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO THE  

6766
03:36:36,116 --> 03:36:37,951
STUDIES THAT THEY'RE DOING AND 

6767
03:36:37,951 --> 03:36:38,719
PUBLISH THE RESULTS. 

6768
03:36:38,719 --> 03:36:40,487
>> YOU'RE FINE WITH THEM BEING 

6769
03:36:40,487 --> 03:36:42,788
PUBLIC AND WHAT'S THE TIMING ON 

6770
03:36:42,788 --> 03:36:43,723
GETTING THOSE OUT? 

6771
03:36:43,723 --> 03:36:46,026
>> SENATOR, WE'RE KICKING OFF 

6772
03:36:46,026 --> 03:36:46,893
THE RESEARCH NOW. 

6773
03:36:46,893 --> 03:36:50,297
OUR GOAL IS TO FOCUS ON BOTH 

6774
03:36:50,297 --> 03:36:51,798
PROVIDING IDEAS FOR PREVENTING 

6775
03:36:51,798 --> 03:36:54,101
INTERFERENCE IN 2018 AND BEYOND 

6776
03:36:54,101 --> 03:36:55,802
AND ALSO FOR HOLDING US 

6777
03:36:55,802 --> 03:36:57,070
ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKING SURE THAT 

6778
03:36:57,070 --> 03:36:58,371
THE MEASURES WE PUT IN PLACE 

6779
03:36:58,371 --> 03:36:59,773
ARE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT. 

6780
03:36:59,773 --> 03:37:01,107
SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WILL 

6781
03:37:01,107 --> 03:37:03,243
START TO SEE THE FIRST RESULTS 

6782
03:37:03,243 --> 03:37:04,511
LATER THIS YEAR. 

6783
03:37:04,511 --> 03:37:07,113
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6784
03:37:07,113 --> 03:37:08,348
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR UDALL. 

6785
03:37:08,348 --> 03:37:09,616
SENATOR MORAN IS UP NEXT. 

6786
03:37:09,616 --> 03:37:10,917
I WOULD JUST SAY AGAIN FOR THE 

6787
03:37:10,917 --> 03:37:12,419
BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO ARE HERE 

6788
03:37:12,419 --> 03:37:14,521
THAT AFTER A COUPLE MORE 

6789
03:37:14,521 --> 03:37:15,522
QUESTIONERS WE'LL PROBABLY GIVE 

6790
03:37:15,522 --> 03:37:16,623
THE WITNESS ANOTHER SHORT 

6791
03:37:16,623 --> 03:37:16,856
BREAK. 

6792
03:37:16,856 --> 03:37:17,624
>> THANK YOU. 

6793
03:37:17,624 --> 03:37:19,826
>> WE'RE GETTING ABOUT ALMOST 

6794
03:37:19,826 --> 03:37:21,027
2/3 THROUGH THE LIST OF MEMBERS 

6795
03:37:21,027 --> 03:37:23,963
WHO ARE HERE TO ASK QUESTIONS. 

6796
03:37:23,963 --> 03:37:24,330
SENATOR MORAN. 

6797
03:37:24,330 --> 03:37:25,899
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU. 

6798
03:37:25,899 --> 03:37:27,033
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANK YOU FOR 

6799
03:37:27,033 --> 03:37:28,735
YOUR TESTIMONY AND PRESENCE 

6800
03:37:28,735 --> 03:37:29,736
HERE TODAY. 

6801
03:37:29,736 --> 03:37:32,105
ON MARCH THE 26th OF THIS YEAR 

6802
03:37:32,105 --> 03:37:34,307
THE FTC CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS 

6803
03:37:34,307 --> 03:37:35,709
INVESTIGATING FACEBOOK TO 

6804
03:37:35,709 --> 03:37:36,710
DETERMINE WHETHER ITS PRIVACY 

6805
03:37:36,710 --> 03:37:40,313
PRACTICES VIOLATED THE FTC ACT 

6806
03:37:40,313 --> 03:37:41,715
OR THE CONSENT ORDER THAT 

6807
03:37:41,715 --> 03:37:43,350
FACEBOOK ENTERED INTO WITH THE 

6808
03:37:43,350 --> 03:37:45,018
AGENCY IN 2011. 

6809
03:37:45,018 --> 03:37:46,486
I CHAIR THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE 

6810
03:37:46,486 --> 03:37:47,421
SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HAS 

6811
03:37:47,421 --> 03:37:49,222
JURISDICTION OVER THE FEDERAL 

6812
03:37:49,222 --> 03:37:49,622
TRADE COMMISSION. 

6813
03:37:49,622 --> 03:37:50,524
I REMAIN INTERESTED IN 

6814
03:37:50,524 --> 03:37:51,725
FACEBOOK'S ASSERTION THAT IT 

6815
03:37:51,725 --> 03:37:53,426
REJECTS ANY SUGGESTION OF 

6816
03:37:53,426 --> 03:37:54,394
VIOLATING THAT CONSENT ORDER. 

6817
03:37:56,663 --> 03:37:57,831
PART TWO OF THAT CONSENT ORDER 

6818
03:37:57,831 --> 03:38:00,133
REQUIRES THAT FACEBOOK "CLEARLY 

6819
03:38:00,133 --> 03:38:03,036
AND PROMINENTLY DISPLAY NOTICE 

6820
03:38:03,036 --> 03:38:04,304
AND OBTAIN USERS' AFFIRMATIVE 

6821
03:38:04,304 --> 03:38:06,506
CONSENT BEFORE SHARING THEIR 

6822
03:38:06,506 --> 03:38:08,441
INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD 

6823
03:38:08,441 --> 03:38:08,708
PARTY." 

6824
03:38:08,708 --> 03:38:10,844
MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE 

6825
03:38:10,844 --> 03:38:12,946
CASE OF APPROXIMATELY 87 

6826
03:38:12,946 --> 03:38:14,514
MILLION FACEBOOK FRIENDS HAVING 

6827
03:38:14,514 --> 03:38:16,549
THEIR DATA SHARED WITH A THIRD 

6828
03:38:16,549 --> 03:38:19,319
PARTY DUE TO THE CONSENT OF 

6829
03:38:19,319 --> 03:38:21,321
ONLY 300,000 CONSENTING USERS 

6830
03:38:21,321 --> 03:38:23,623
NOT VIOLATE THAT AGREEMENT? 

6831
03:38:25,124 --> 03:38:27,227
>> WELL, SENATOR, LIKE I SAID 

6832
03:38:27,227 --> 03:38:30,130
EARLIER, OUR VIEW IS THAT WE 

6833
03:38:30,130 --> 03:38:31,231
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN 

6834
03:38:31,231 --> 03:38:31,831
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSENT 

6835
03:38:31,831 --> 03:38:33,633
ORDER, BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE 

6836
03:38:33,633 --> 03:38:35,235
A BROADER RESPONSIBILITY TO 

6837
03:38:35,235 --> 03:38:37,304
PROTECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY EVEN 

6838
03:38:37,304 --> 03:38:39,105
BEYOND THAT AND IN THIS 

6839
03:38:39,105 --> 03:38:41,241
SPECIFIC CASE THE WAY THAT THE 

6840
03:38:41,241 --> 03:38:42,642
PLATFORM WORKED OR THAT YOU 

6841
03:38:42,642 --> 03:38:43,543
COULD SIGN INTO AN APP AND 

6842
03:38:43,543 --> 03:38:44,744
BRING SOME OF YOUR INFORMATION 

6843
03:38:44,744 --> 03:38:46,446
AND SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS' 

6844
03:38:46,446 --> 03:38:47,847
INFORMATION IS HOW WE EXPLAINED 

6845
03:38:47,847 --> 03:38:49,049
IT WOULD WORK. 

6846
03:38:49,049 --> 03:38:52,352
PEOPLE HAD SETTINGS TO THAT 

6847
03:38:52,352 --> 03:38:52,585
EFFECT. 

6848
03:38:52,585 --> 03:38:53,753
WE EXPLAINED AND THEY CONSENTED 

6849
03:38:53,753 --> 03:38:56,723
TO IT WORKING THAT WAY AND THE 

6850
03:38:56,723 --> 03:38:58,525
SYSTEM BASICALLY WORKED AS IT 

6851
03:38:58,525 --> 03:38:58,858
WAS DESIGNED. 

6852
03:38:58,858 --> 03:38:59,859
THE ISSUE IS THAT WE DESIGNED 

6853
03:38:59,859 --> 03:39:02,362
THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WASN'T 

6854
03:39:02,362 --> 03:39:04,731
GOOD AND NOW WE STARTING IN 

6855
03:39:04,731 --> 03:39:06,266
2014 HAVE CHANGED THE DESIGN OF 

6856
03:39:06,266 --> 03:39:09,236
THE SYSTEM SO THAT WAY IT JUST 

6857
03:39:09,236 --> 03:39:10,503
MASSIVELY RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT 

6858
03:39:10,503 --> 03:39:13,707
OF DATA ACCESS THAT A DEVELOPER 

6859
03:39:13,707 --> 03:39:14,574
COULD GET. 

6860
03:39:14,574 --> 03:39:14,974
GOING FORWARD -- 

6861
03:39:14,974 --> 03:39:17,444
>> I'M SORRY, THE 300,000 

6862
03:39:17,444 --> 03:39:19,145
PEOPLE THAT WERE TREATED IN A 

6863
03:39:19,145 --> 03:39:20,780
WAY THAT IS APPROPRIATE. 

6864
03:39:20,780 --> 03:39:22,682
THEY CONSENTED, BUT YOU'RE NOT 

6865
03:39:22,682 --> 03:39:25,252
SUGGESTING THAT THE FRIENDS 

6866
03:39:25,252 --> 03:39:26,253
CONSENTED. 

6867
03:39:26,253 --> 03:39:28,255
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE THAT WE 

6868
03:39:28,255 --> 03:39:29,221
ROLLED OUT THIS DEVELOPER 

6869
03:39:29,221 --> 03:39:30,623
PLATFORM AND THAT WE EXPLAINED 

6870
03:39:30,623 --> 03:39:32,359
TO PEOPLE HOW IT WORKED AND 

6871
03:39:32,359 --> 03:39:33,626
THAT THEY DID CONSENT TO IT. 

6872
03:39:33,626 --> 03:39:36,429
IT MAKES SENSE I THINK TO GO 

6873
03:39:36,429 --> 03:39:39,332
THROUGH THE WAY THE PLATFORM 

6874
03:39:39,332 --> 03:39:40,333
WORKS. 

6875
03:39:40,333 --> 03:39:42,936
I MEAN IN 2007 WE ANNOUNCED THE 

6876
03:39:42,936 --> 03:39:43,903
FACEBOOK DEVELOPER PLATFORM AND 

6877
03:39:43,903 --> 03:39:48,875
THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU WANTED TO 

6878
03:39:48,875 --> 03:39:51,077
MAKE MORE EXPERIENCES SOCIAL. 

6879
03:39:51,077 --> 03:39:52,445
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU NIGHT 

6880
03:39:52,445 --> 03:39:54,247
WANT TO HAVE A CALENDAR -- 

6881
03:39:54,247 --> 03:39:56,149
MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A CALENDAR 

6882
03:39:56,149 --> 03:39:57,350
THAT CAN HAVE YOUR FRIENDS' 

6883
03:39:57,350 --> 03:39:58,752
BIRTHDAYS OR IT OR YOU MIGHT 

6884
03:39:58,752 --> 03:40:00,153
WANT YOUR ADDRESS BOOK TO HAVE 

6885
03:40:00,153 --> 03:40:01,354
YOUR FRIENDS' PICKS IN IT OR 

6886
03:40:01,354 --> 03:40:03,356
YOU MIGHT WANT A MAP THAT CAN 

6887
03:40:03,356 --> 03:40:04,758
SHOW YOUR FRIENDS' ADDRESSES ON 

6888
03:40:04,758 --> 03:40:04,925
IT. 

6889
03:40:04,925 --> 03:40:06,760
IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE NEEDED 

6890
03:40:06,760 --> 03:40:08,528
TO BUILD A TOOL THAT ALLOWED 

6891
03:40:08,528 --> 03:40:10,163
PEOPLE TO SIGN INTO AN APP AND 

6892
03:40:10,163 --> 03:40:10,930
BRING SOME OF THEIR INFORMATION 

6893
03:40:10,930 --> 03:40:12,032
AND SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS' 

6894
03:40:12,032 --> 03:40:13,233
INFORMATION TO THOSE APPS. 

6895
03:40:13,233 --> 03:40:14,467
WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS 

6896
03:40:14,467 --> 03:40:16,035
IS HOW IT WORKED AND WHEN 

6897
03:40:16,035 --> 03:40:17,604
PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR FACEBOOK, 

6898
03:40:17,604 --> 03:40:19,506
THEY SIGNED UP FOR THAT AS 

6899
03:40:19,506 --> 03:40:19,806
WELL. 

6900
03:40:19,806 --> 03:40:21,374
NOW A LOT OF GOOD USE CASES 

6901
03:40:21,374 --> 03:40:22,042
CAME FROM THAT. 

6902
03:40:22,042 --> 03:40:24,244
I MEAN THERE WERE GAMES THAT 

6903
03:40:24,244 --> 03:40:24,777
WERE BUILT. 

6904
03:40:24,777 --> 03:40:26,346
THERE WERE INTEGRATIONS WITH 

6905
03:40:26,346 --> 03:40:28,548
COMPANIES THAT I THINK WE'RE 

6906
03:40:28,548 --> 03:40:30,550
FAMILIAR WITH LIKE NETFLIX AND 

6907
03:40:30,550 --> 03:40:31,451
SPOTIFY, BUT OVER TIME WHAT 

6908
03:40:31,451 --> 03:40:33,186
BECAME CLEAR WAS THAT THAT ALSO 

6909
03:40:33,186 --> 03:40:34,787
ENABLED SOME ABUSE. 

6910
03:40:34,787 --> 03:40:36,756
THAT'S WHY IN 2014 WE TOOK THE 

6911
03:40:36,756 --> 03:40:39,459
STEP OF CHANGING THE PLATFORM 

6912
03:40:39,459 --> 03:40:41,661
SO NOW WHEN PEOPLE SIGN INTO AN 

6913
03:40:41,661 --> 03:40:42,462
APP, YOU DO NOT BRING SOME OF 

6914
03:40:42,462 --> 03:40:43,563
YOUR FRIENDS' INFORMATION WITH 

6915
03:40:43,563 --> 03:40:43,963
YOU. 

6916
03:40:43,963 --> 03:40:45,031
YOU ARE ONLY BRINGING YOUR OWN 

6917
03:40:45,031 --> 03:40:46,666
INFORMATION AND YOU'RE ABLE TO 

6918
03:40:46,666 --> 03:40:48,668
CONNECT WITH FRIENDS THAT HAVE 

6919
03:40:48,668 --> 03:40:49,336
ALSO AUTHORIZED THAT APP 

6920
03:40:49,336 --> 03:40:49,603
DRECTLY. 

6921
03:40:49,603 --> 03:40:52,005
>> LET ME TURN TO YOUR BUG 

6922
03:40:52,005 --> 03:40:53,172
BOUNTY PROGRAM. 

6923
03:40:53,172 --> 03:40:54,841
OUR SUBCOMMITTEE HAS HAD A 

6924
03:40:54,841 --> 03:40:58,344
HEARING IN REGARD TO BUG 

6925
03:40:58,344 --> 03:40:58,577
BOUNTY. 

6926
03:40:58,577 --> 03:40:59,411
YOUR PRESS RELEASE INDICATED 

6927
03:40:59,411 --> 03:41:01,047
THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIX CHANGES 

6928
03:41:01,047 --> 03:41:02,248
FACEBOOK INITIALLY OFFERED TO 

6929
03:41:02,248 --> 03:41:04,384
CRACK DOWN ON PLATFORM ABUSES 

6930
03:41:04,384 --> 03:41:05,185
WAS TO AWARD OUTSIDE PARTIES 

6931
03:41:05,185 --> 03:41:07,654
WHO FIND VULNERABILITIES. 

6932
03:41:09,456 --> 03:41:10,657
ONE CONCERN I HAVE REGARDING 

6933
03:41:10,657 --> 03:41:12,859
UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH IS 

6934
03:41:12,859 --> 03:41:15,161
THAT THE VULNERABILITY 

6935
03:41:15,161 --> 03:41:15,661
DISCLOSURE PROGRAMS ARE 

6936
03:41:15,661 --> 03:41:17,364
NORMALLY GEARED TOWARD 

6937
03:41:17,364 --> 03:41:18,365
IDENTIFYING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS 

6938
03:41:18,365 --> 03:41:22,369
TO DATA, NOT POINTING OUT DATA 

6939
03:41:22,369 --> 03:41:22,969
SHARING ARRANGEMENTS THAT 

6940
03:41:22,969 --> 03:41:25,405
LIKELY COULD HARM SOMEONE, BUT 

6941
03:41:25,405 --> 03:41:26,740
TECHNICALLY ABIDE BY COMPLEX 

6942
03:41:26,740 --> 03:41:27,240
CONSENT AGREEMENTS. 

6943
03:41:27,240 --> 03:41:30,076
HOW DO YOU SEE THE BUG BOUNTY 

6944
03:41:30,076 --> 03:41:32,379
PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE ANNOUNCED 

6945
03:41:32,379 --> 03:41:33,880
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THAT? 

6946
03:41:36,082 --> 03:41:36,349
>> SORRY. 

6947
03:41:36,349 --> 03:41:37,750
COULD YOU CLARIFY WHAT SPECIFIC 

6948
03:41:37,750 --> 03:41:37,917
-- 

6949
03:41:37,917 --> 03:41:40,487
>> HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THE BUG 

6950
03:41:40,487 --> 03:41:42,188
BOUNTY PROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE 

6951
03:41:42,188 --> 03:41:46,426
ANNOUNCED WILL DEAL WITH THE 

6952
03:41:46,426 --> 03:41:46,993
SHARING OF INFORMATION NOT 

6953
03:41:46,993 --> 03:41:48,995
PERMISSIBLE AS COMPARED TO JUST 

6954
03:41:48,995 --> 03:41:52,299
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO DATA? 

6955
03:41:54,567 --> 03:41:56,302
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT ACTUALLY 

6956
03:41:56,302 --> 03:41:57,971
SURE I UNDERSTAND THIS ENOUGH 

6957
03:41:57,971 --> 03:41:59,572
TO SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC POINT 

6958
03:41:59,572 --> 03:42:01,307
AND I CAN HAVE MY TEAM FOLLOW 

6959
03:42:01,307 --> 03:42:04,210
UP WITH YOU ON THE DETAILS OF 

6960
03:42:04,210 --> 03:42:04,878
THAT. 

6961
03:42:04,878 --> 03:42:06,913
IN GENERAL, BOUNTY PROGRAMS ARE 

6962
03:42:06,913 --> 03:42:08,681
AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 

6963
03:42:08,681 --> 03:42:09,949
SECURITY ARSENAL FOR HARDENING 

6964
03:42:09,949 --> 03:42:13,086
A LOT OF SYSTEMS. 

6965
03:42:13,086 --> 03:42:14,220
I THINK WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT 

6966
03:42:14,220 --> 03:42:16,122
WE'RE GOING TO INVEST A LOT IN 

6967
03:42:16,122 --> 03:42:17,189
HARDENING OUR SYSTEMS OURSELVES 

6968
03:42:17,189 --> 03:42:18,224
AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO AUDIT 

6969
03:42:18,224 --> 03:42:19,526
AND INVESTIGATE A LOT OF THE 

6970
03:42:19,526 --> 03:42:21,694
FOLKS IN OUR ECOSYSTEM, BUT 

6971
03:42:21,694 --> 03:42:23,863
EVEN WITH THAT HAVING THE 

6972
03:42:23,863 --> 03:42:24,898
ABILITY TO ENLIST OTHER THIRD 

6973
03:42:24,898 --> 03:42:25,899
PARTIES OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY 

6974
03:42:25,899 --> 03:42:29,569
TO BE ABLE TO HELP US OUT BY 

6975
03:42:29,569 --> 03:42:31,137
GIVING THEM AN INCENTIVE TO 

6976
03:42:31,137 --> 03:42:32,572
POINT OUT WHEN THEY SEE ISSUES 

6977
03:42:32,572 --> 03:42:36,910
I THINK IS LIKELY GOING TO HELP 

6978
03:42:36,910 --> 03:42:38,377
US IMPROVE THE SECURITY OF THE 

6979
03:42:38,377 --> 03:42:39,446
PLATFORM OVERALL, WHICH IS WHY 

6980
03:42:39,446 --> 03:42:40,413
WE DID THIS. 

6981
03:42:40,413 --> 03:42:41,847
>> NEXT UP SENATOR BOOKER. 

6982
03:42:41,847 --> 03:42:44,417
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

6983
03:42:44,417 --> 03:42:45,118
HELLO, MR. ZUCKERBERG. 

6984
03:42:45,118 --> 03:42:46,486
AS YOU KNOW, MUCH OF MY LIFE 

6985
03:42:46,486 --> 03:42:49,889
HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON LOW INCOME 

6986
03:42:49,889 --> 03:42:50,723
COMMUNITIES, POOR COMMUNITIES, 

6987
03:42:50,723 --> 03:42:51,424
WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES AND 

6988
03:42:51,424 --> 03:42:53,126
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A 

6989
03:42:53,126 --> 03:42:54,226
FAIR SHAKE. 

6990
03:42:54,226 --> 03:42:55,995
THIS COUNTRY HAS A VERY BAD 

6991
03:42:55,995 --> 03:42:57,597
HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATORY 

6992
03:42:57,597 --> 03:42:59,199
PRACTICES TOWARDS LOW INCOME 

6993
03:42:59,199 --> 03:42:59,833
AMERICANS AND AMERICANS OF 

6994
03:42:59,833 --> 03:43:02,735
COLOR FROM THE RED LINING FHA 

6995
03:43:02,735 --> 03:43:04,170
PRACTICES AND UNTIL RECENTLY IN 

6996
03:43:04,170 --> 03:43:05,338
THE MORE DISCRIMINATORY 

6997
03:43:05,338 --> 03:43:07,874
PRACTICES IN THE MORTGAGE 

6998
03:43:07,874 --> 03:43:08,174
BUSINESS. 

6999
03:43:08,174 --> 03:43:13,813
I'VE ALWAYS SEEN TECHNOLOGY AS 

7000
03:43:13,813 --> 03:43:16,615
A PROMISE TO DEMOCRATIZE OUR 

7001
03:43:16,615 --> 03:43:17,717
NATIONS AND EXPAND 

7002
03:43:17,717 --> 03:43:18,150
OPPORTUNITIES, BUT 

7003
03:43:18,150 --> 03:43:18,918
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN HOW 

7004
03:43:18,918 --> 03:43:20,820
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS LIKE úFACE 

7005
03:43:20,820 --> 03:43:21,887
TO DOUBLE DOWN ON 

7006
03:43:21,887 --> 03:43:23,022
DISCRIMINATION AND GIVE PEOPLE 

7007
03:43:23,022 --> 03:43:24,824
MORE SOPHISTICATED TOOLS WITH 

7008
03:43:24,824 --> 03:43:30,129
WHICH TO DISCRIMINATE. 

7009
03:43:30,129 --> 03:43:33,933
IN 2016 PRO PUBLICA REVEALED 

7010
03:43:33,933 --> 03:43:36,202
THAT ADVERTISERS COULD USE A 

7011
03:43:36,202 --> 03:43:38,371
USER'S RACE TO MARKET 

7012
03:43:38,371 --> 03:43:39,272
CATEGORIES TO POTENTIALLY 

7013
03:43:39,272 --> 03:43:39,973
DISCRIMINATE OVERALL AGAINST 

7014
03:43:39,973 --> 03:43:42,709
FACEBOOK USERS IN THE AREAS OF 

7015
03:43:42,709 --> 03:43:43,943
HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT AND CREDIT 

7016
03:43:43,943 --> 03:43:46,346
ECHOING A DARK HISTORY IN THIS 

7017
03:43:46,346 --> 03:43:47,279
COUNTRY AND ALSO IN VIOLATION 

7018
03:43:47,279 --> 03:43:48,314
OF FEDERAL LAW. 

7019
03:43:50,316 --> 03:43:52,218
IN 2016 FACEBOOK COMMITTED TO 

7020
03:43:52,218 --> 03:43:53,119
FIXING THIS, THAT THE 

7021
03:43:53,119 --> 03:43:54,921
ADVERTISERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO 

7022
03:43:54,921 --> 03:43:57,724
THIS DATA, TO FIXING IT, BUT 

7023
03:43:57,724 --> 03:44:01,728
UNFORTUNATELY A YEAR LATER AS 

7024
03:44:01,728 --> 03:44:03,229
PRO PUBLICA'S ARTICLE SHOWED, 

7025
03:44:03,229 --> 03:44:04,297
THEY FOUND THE SYSTEM FACEBOOK 

7026
03:44:04,297 --> 03:44:08,067
BUILT WAS STILL ALLOWING 

7027
03:44:08,067 --> 03:44:10,470
HOUSING ADS WITHOUT -- TO GO 

7028
03:44:10,470 --> 03:44:11,671
FORWARD WITHOUT APPLYING THESE 

7029
03:44:11,671 --> 03:44:13,206
NEW RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PUT 

7030
03:44:13,206 --> 03:44:13,406
ON. 

7031
03:44:13,406 --> 03:44:14,907
FACEBOOK THEN OPTED IN A SYSTEM 

7032
03:44:14,907 --> 03:44:15,908
THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT 

7033
03:44:15,908 --> 03:44:18,011
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH 

7034
03:44:18,011 --> 03:44:18,911
CAME THAT THEY COULD SELF-

7035
03:44:18,911 --> 03:44:21,014
CERTIFY THAT THEY WERE NOT 

7036
03:44:21,014 --> 03:44:23,516
ENGAGING IN THESE PRACTICES AND 

7037
03:44:23,516 --> 03:44:26,452
COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL LAW 

7038
03:44:26,452 --> 03:44:29,722
USING THIS SELF-CERTIFICATION 

7039
03:44:29,722 --> 03:44:32,725
WAY TO OVERCOME AND TO COMPLY 

7040
03:44:32,725 --> 03:44:36,329
WITH RATHER FACEBOOK'S ANTI-

7041
03:44:36,329 --> 03:44:36,829
DISCRIMINATION POLICY. 

7042
03:44:36,829 --> 03:44:37,396
UNFORTUNATELY IN A RECENT 

7043
03:44:37,396 --> 03:44:41,301
LAWSUIT AS OF FEBRUARY, 2018 

7044
03:44:41,301 --> 03:44:43,069
ALLEGES THAT DISCRIMINATORY ADS 

7045
03:44:43,069 --> 03:44:45,572
WERE STILL BEING CREATED ON 

7046
03:44:45,572 --> 03:44:46,305

03:44:49,175 --> 03:44:51,277
GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU ALLOWED 

7051
03:44:51,277 --> 03:44:52,378
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA TO SELF-

7052
03:44:52,378 --> 03:44:54,280
CERTIFY IN A WAY THAT AT LEAST 

7053
03:44:54,280 --> 03:44:57,483
I THINK YOU'VE EXPRESSED REGRET 

7054
03:44:57,483 --> 03:44:58,685
OVER, IS SELF-CERTIFICATION THE 

7055
03:44:58,685 --> 03:45:00,286
BEST AND STRONGEST WAY TO 

7056
03:45:00,286 --> 03:45:01,287
SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MISUSE OF 

7057
03:45:01,287 --> 03:45:04,791
YOUR PLATFORM AND PROTECT THE 

7058
03:45:04,791 --> 03:45:06,693
DATA OF USERS, NOT LET IT BE 

7059
03:45:06,693 --> 03:45:08,928
MANIPULATED IN SUCH A 

7060
03:45:08,928 --> 03:45:09,428
DISCRIMINATORY FASHION? 

7061
03:45:09,428 --> 03:45:14,667
>> SENATOR,  THIS IS A VERY 

7062
03:45:14,667 --> 03:45:15,167
IMPORTANT QUESTION. 

7063
03:45:15,167 --> 03:45:16,269
IN GENERAL I THINK OVER TIME 

7064
03:45:16,269 --> 03:45:18,137
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TOWARDS 

7065
03:45:18,137 --> 03:45:20,340
MORE PROACTIVE REVIEW WITH MORE 

7066
03:45:20,340 --> 03:45:23,843
AI TOOLS TO HELP FLAG 

7067
03:45:23,843 --> 03:45:24,310
PROBLEMATIC CONTENT. 

7068
03:45:24,310 --> 03:45:26,479
IN THE NEAR TERM WE HAVE A LOT 

7069
03:45:26,479 --> 03:45:29,114
OF CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM AND 

7070
03:45:29,114 --> 03:45:30,917
IT'S HARD TO REVIEW EVERY 

7071
03:45:30,917 --> 03:45:32,017
SINGLE THING UP FRONT. 

7072
03:45:32,017 --> 03:45:34,687
WE DO A QUICK SCREEN. 

7073
03:45:37,090 --> 03:45:38,992
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IN 

7074
03:45:38,992 --> 03:45:39,659
THIS SPECIFIC CASE I'M NOT 

7075
03:45:39,659 --> 03:45:43,162
HAPPY WITH WHERE WE ARE AND I 

7076
03:45:43,162 --> 03:45:44,464
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO REALLY 

7077
03:45:44,464 --> 03:45:46,799
FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE 

7078
03:45:46,799 --> 03:45:48,601
AREAS GET MORE REVIEW SOONER. 

7079
03:45:48,601 --> 03:45:50,203
>> I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 

7080
03:45:50,203 --> 03:45:52,204
THERE IS A GROWING DISTRUST. 

7081
03:45:52,204 --> 03:45:53,672
I KNOW A LOT OF CIVIL RIGHTS 

7082
03:45:53,672 --> 03:45:56,742
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MET WITH YOU 

7083
03:45:56,742 --> 03:45:57,977
ABOUT FACEBOOK'S SENSE OF 

7084
03:45:57,977 --> 03:46:00,279
URGENCY TO ADDRESS THESE 

7085
03:46:00,279 --> 03:46:00,512
ISSUES. 

7086
03:46:00,512 --> 03:46:01,681
THERE'S A DISTRUST THAT STEMS 

7087
03:46:01,681 --> 03:46:03,783
FROM THE FACT AND I HAVE HAD 

7088
03:46:03,783 --> 03:46:04,884
CONVERSATIONS WITH LEADERS IN 

7089
03:46:04,884 --> 03:46:05,985
FACEBOOK ABOUT THE LACK OF 

7090
03:46:05,985 --> 03:46:07,486
DIVERSITY IN THE TECH SECTOR AS 

7091
03:46:07,486 --> 03:46:09,589
WELL, PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING 

7092
03:46:09,589 --> 03:46:10,590
THESE ALGORITHMS, PEOPLE WHO 

7093
03:46:10,590 --> 03:46:12,392
ARE ACTUALLY POLICING FOR THIS 

7094
03:46:12,392 --> 03:46:15,895
DATA, POLICING FOR THESE 

7095
03:46:15,895 --> 03:46:16,162
PROBLEMS. 

7096
03:46:16,162 --> 03:46:17,897
ARE THEY GOING TO BE A PART OF 

7097
03:46:17,897 --> 03:46:19,231
A MORE DIVERSE GROUP THAT'S 

7098
03:46:19,231 --> 03:46:20,099
LOOKING AT THIS? 

7099
03:46:20,099 --> 03:46:21,868
YOU'RE LOOKING TO HIRE, AS YOU 

7100
03:46:21,868 --> 03:46:23,269
SAID, 5,000 NEW POSITIONS FOR 

7101
03:46:23,269 --> 03:46:24,937
AMONG OTHER THINGS REVIEWING 

7102
03:46:24,937 --> 03:46:29,809
CONTENT, BUT WE KNOW IN YOUR 

7103
03:46:29,809 --> 03:46:36,516
INDUSTRY THE INCLUSIVE 

7104
03:46:36,516 --> 03:46:38,985
INCLUSIVENESS, IT'S A REALLY 

7105
03:46:38,985 --> 03:46:40,286
PROBLEM -- INCLUSIVENESS, IT'S 

7106
03:46:40,286 --> 03:46:41,587
A REAL PROBLEM, NOT JUST WITH 

7107
03:46:41,587 --> 03:46:48,294
FACEBOOK BUT IN THE TECH AREA. 

7108
03:46:48,294 --> 03:46:53,666
WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS A 

7109
03:46:53,666 --> 03:46:54,467
MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND 

7110
03:46:54,467 --> 03:46:56,102
I'M WONDERING IF YOU'D BE OPEN 

7111
03:46:56,102 --> 03:46:57,069
TO OPENING YOUR PLATFORM FOR 

7112
03:46:57,069 --> 03:46:57,970
CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS TO 

7113
03:46:57,970 --> 03:46:59,739
REALLY AUDIT A LOT OF THESE 

7114
03:46:59,739 --> 03:47:00,673
COMPANIES DEALING IN AREAS OF 

7115
03:47:00,673 --> 03:47:01,708
CREDIT AND HOUSING TO REALLY 

7116
03:47:01,708 --> 03:47:02,975
AUDIT WHAT IS ACTUALLY 

7117
03:47:02,975 --> 03:47:04,343
HAPPENING AND BETTER HAVE MORE 

7118
03:47:04,343 --> 03:47:06,579
TRANSPARENCY IN WORKING WITH 

7119
03:47:06,579 --> 03:47:06,946
YOUR PLATFORM? 

7120
03:47:06,946 --> 03:47:07,980
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT'S A 

7121
03:47:07,980 --> 03:47:09,382
VERY GOOD IDEA AND I THINK WE 

7122
03:47:09,382 --> 03:47:11,617
SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON THE DETAILS 

7123
03:47:11,617 --> 03:47:11,884
OF THAT. 

7124
03:47:11,884 --> 03:47:14,721
>> I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT 

7125
03:47:14,721 --> 03:47:16,756
THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION, 

7126
03:47:16,756 --> 03:47:17,890
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY 

7127
03:47:17,890 --> 03:47:20,593
DISTURBING TO ME IS THE FACT 

7128
03:47:20,593 --> 03:47:22,695
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LAW 

7129
03:47:22,695 --> 03:47:26,399
ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT 

7130
03:47:26,399 --> 03:47:30,403
USE FACEBOOK'S PLATFORM TO 

7131
03:47:30,403 --> 03:47:30,936
SURVEIL AFRICAN AMERICAN 

7132
03:47:30,936 --> 03:47:32,472
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE BLACK LIVES 

7133
03:47:32,472 --> 03:47:33,840
MATTER. 

7134
03:47:33,840 --> 03:47:36,209
I KNOW YOU'VE EXPRESSED SUPPORT 

7135
03:47:36,209 --> 03:47:52,792
FOR THE GROUP AND IF I PHILANDO 

7136
03:47:52,792 --> 03:47:57,963
CASTILE'S KILLING WAS LIVE ON 

7137
03:47:57,963 --> 03:47:58,230
FACEBOOK. 

7138
03:47:58,230 --> 03:48:00,299
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE 

7139
03:48:00,299 --> 03:48:03,169
COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING AND 

7140
03:48:03,169 --> 03:48:04,570
INSURING THAT THE FREEDOMS THAT 

7141
03:48:04,570 --> 03:48:05,772

7146
03:48:15,915 --> 03:48:17,517
UNDERMINE THE ACTIVITIES THOSE 

7147
03:48:17,517 --> 03:48:18,651
GROUPS ARE DOING? 

7148
03:48:18,651 --> 03:48:19,351
>> YES, SENATOR. 

7149
03:48:19,351 --> 03:48:22,088
I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY 

7150
03:48:22,088 --> 03:48:22,555
IMPORTANT. 

7151
03:48:22,555 --> 03:48:24,590
WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AND IN

7156
03:48:32,198 --> 03:48:34,700
PUSH BACK ON THAT ACROSS THE 

7157
03:48:34,700 --> 03:48:34,933
BOARD. 

7158
03:48:34,933 --> 03:48:35,968
>> THEN I'D JUST LIKE FOR THE 

7159
03:48:35,968 --> 03:48:37,403
RECORD BECAUSE MY TIME IS 

7160
03:48:37,403 --> 03:48:39,672
EXPIRED, BUT THERE'S A LAWSUIT 

7161
03:48:39,672 --> 03:48:40,172
AGAINST FACEBOOK ABOUT 

7162
03:48:40,172 --> 03:48:41,374
DISCRIMINATION AND YOU MOVED 

7163
03:48:41,374 --> 03:48:42,575
FOR THE LAWSUIT TO BE DISMISSED 

7164
03:48:42,575 --> 03:48:44,577
BECAUSE NO HARM WAS SHOWN. 

7165
03:48:44,577 --> 03:48:47,180
COULD YOU PLEASE SUBMIT TO THE 

7166
03:48:47,180 --> 03:48:48,581
RECORD, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT 

7167
03:48:48,581 --> 03:48:50,883
PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE NOT 

7168
03:48:50,883 --> 03:48:51,784
RECRUITED FOR VARIOUS ECONOMIC 

7169
03:48:51,784 --> 03:48:53,486
OPPORTUNITIES OR BEING HARMED, 

7170
03:48:53,486 --> 03:48:55,688
CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY WHY YOU 

7171
03:48:55,688 --> 03:48:58,457
MOVED TO DISMISS THAT LAWSUIT

FOR THE RECORD? 

7173

THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME.

I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND

STRETCH HERE, BUT I'M GLAD THAT 

7181
03:49:17,710 --> 03:49:18,478
YOU ARE HERE. 

7182

YESTERDAY FACEBOOK SENT OUT A

WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. 

7187

CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY 

7192
03:49:38,898 --> 03:49:41,100
NEVADANS WERE AMONG THE 87

I FIGURED THAT WOULD BE THE 

7202
03:49:52,912 --> 03:49:53,145
ANSWER. 

7203
03:49:53,145 --> 03:49:54,914
IF AFTER HEARING THIS, GOING 

7204
03:49:54,914 --> 03:49:56,015
THROUGH THIS HEARING AND 

7205
03:49:56,015 --> 03:49:57,617
NEVADANS NO LONGER WANT TO HAVE 

7206
03:49:57,617 --> 03:49:59,118
A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, IF THAT'S 

7207
03:49:59,118 --> 03:50:01,687
THE CASE, IF A FACEBOOK USER 

7208
03:50:01,687 --> 03:50:02,922
DELETES THEIR ACCOUNT, DO YOU 

7209
03:50:02,922 --> 03:50:03,622
DELETE THEIR DATA? 

7210
03:50:03,622 --> 03:50:05,925
>> YES. 

7211
03:50:06,893 --> 03:50:09,028
>> MY KIDS HAVE BEEN ON 

7212
03:50:09,028 --> 03:50:10,229
FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM FOR YEARS. 

7213
03:50:10,229 --> 03:50:12,164
HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP A USER'S 

7214
03:50:12,164 --> 03:50:12,832
DATA? 

7215
03:50:14,333 --> 03:50:14,666
>> I'M SORRY. 

7216
03:50:14,666 --> 03:50:15,367
CAN YOU -- 

7217
03:50:15,367 --> 03:50:19,972
>> HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP A 

7218
03:50:19,972 --> 03:50:21,874
USER'S DATAAFTER THEY'VE LEFT? 

7219
03:50:24,309 --> 03:50:25,244
IF THEY CHOOSE TO DELETE THEIR 

7220
03:50:25,244 --> 03:50:27,113
ACCOUNT, HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP 

7221
03:50:27,113 --> 03:50:27,413
THEIR DATA? 

7222
03:50:27,413 --> 03:50:28,948
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 

7223
03:50:28,948 --> 03:50:30,916
THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. 

7224
03:50:30,916 --> 03:50:31,951
I KNOW WE TRY TO DELETE IT AS 

7225
03:50:31,951 --> 03:50:33,419
QUICKLY AS IS REASONABLE. 

7226
03:50:33,419 --> 03:50:34,686
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPLEX 

7227
03:50:34,686 --> 03:50:36,255
SYSTEMS AND IT TAKES A WHILE TO 

7228
03:50:36,255 --> 03:50:37,757
WORK THROUGH ALL THAT, BUT I 

7229
03:50:37,757 --> 03:50:39,759
THINK WE TRY TO MOVE AS QUICKLY 

7230
03:50:39,759 --> 03:50:40,126
AS POSSIBLE. 

7231
03:50:40,126 --> 03:50:41,861
I CAN FOLLOW UP OR HAVE MY TEAM 

7232
03:50:41,861 --> 03:50:45,264
FOLLOW UP TO GET YOU THE DATA 

7233
03:50:45,264 --> 03:50:45,831
ON THAT. 

7234
03:50:45,831 --> 03:50:46,098
>> OKAY. 

7235
03:50:46,098 --> 03:50:47,166
HAVE YOU EVER SAID THAT YOU 

7236
03:50:47,166 --> 03:50:50,069
WON'T SELL AN AD BASED ON 

7237
03:50:50,069 --> 03:50:50,736
PERSONAL INFORMATION, SIMPLY 

7238
03:50:50,736 --> 03:50:52,505
THAT YOU WOULDN'T SELL THIS 

7239
03:50:52,505 --> 03:50:54,440
DATA BECAUSE OF THE USAGE OF IT 

7240
03:50:54,440 --> 03:50:56,976
GOES TOO FAR? 

7241
03:50:58,977 --> 03:51:01,547
>> SENATOR, COULD YOU CLARIFY 

7242
03:51:01,547 --> 03:51:01,747
THAT? 

7243
03:51:01,747 --> 03:51:04,550
>> HAVE YOU EVER DRAWN THE LINE 

7244
03:51:04,550 --> 03:51:06,085
ON SELLING DATA TO AN 

7245
03:51:06,085 --> 03:51:06,552
ADVERTISER? 

7246
03:51:06,552 --> 03:51:07,019
>> YES, SENATOR. 

7247
03:51:07,019 --> 03:51:09,055
WE DON'T SELL DATA AT ALL. 

7248
03:51:09,055 --> 03:51:11,657
THE WAY THE AD SYSTEM WORKS IS 

7249
03:51:11,657 --> 03:51:14,460
ADVERTISERS CAN COME TO US AND 

7250
03:51:14,460 --> 03:51:16,262
SAY I HAVE A MESSAGE THAT I'M 

7251
03:51:16,262 --> 03:51:18,331
TRYING TO REACH A CERTAIN TYPE 

7252
03:51:18,331 --> 03:51:18,631
OF PEOPLE. 

7253
03:51:18,631 --> 03:51:19,899
THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN 

7254
03:51:19,899 --> 03:51:20,199
SOMETHING.  

7255
03:51:20,199 --> 03:51:22,068
THEY MIGHT LIVE IN A PLACE AND 

7256
03:51:22,068 --> 03:51:23,569
THEN WE HELP THEM GET THAT 

7257
03:51:23,569 --> 03:51:26,405
MESSAGE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE, BUT 

7258
03:51:26,405 --> 03:51:29,241
THIS IS ONE OF THE -- IT'S 

7259
03:51:29,241 --> 03:51:30,543
WIDELY MISCHARACTERIZED ABOUT 

7260
03:51:30,543 --> 03:51:32,144
OUR SYSTEM THAT WE SELL DATA 

7261
03:51:32,144 --> 03:51:33,346
AND IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF MOST 

7262
03:51:33,346 --> 03:51:34,313
IMPORTANT PARTS OF HOW FACEBOOK 

7263
03:51:34,313 --> 03:51:36,248
WORKS IS WE DO NOT SELL DATA. 

7264
03:51:36,248 --> 03:51:38,451
ADVERTISERS DO NOT GET ACCESS 

7265
03:51:38,451 --> 03:51:39,918
TO PEOPLE'S INDIVIDUAL DATA. 

7266
03:51:39,918 --> 03:51:41,253
>> HAVE YOU EVER COLLECTED THE 

7267
03:51:41,253 --> 03:51:43,723
CONTENT OF PHONE CALLS OR 

7268
03:51:43,723 --> 03:51:44,956
MESSAGES THROUGH ANY FACEBOOK 

7269
03:51:44,956 --> 03:51:46,525
APPLICATION OR SERVICE? 

7270
03:51:48,761 --> 03:51:50,062
>> SENATOR, I DON'T BELIEVE 

7271
03:51:50,062 --> 03:51:52,064
WE'VE EVER COLLECTED THE 

7272
03:51:52,064 --> 03:51:53,098
CONTENT OF PHONE CALLS. 

7273
03:51:53,098 --> 03:51:56,869
WE HAVE AN APP CALLED MESSENGER 

7274
03:51:56,869 --> 03:51:59,771
THEIR -- MOST OF THEIR FACEBOOK 

7275
03:51:59,771 --> 03:52:02,441
FRIENDS AND WE DO ON THE 

7276
03:52:02,441 --> 03:52:03,776
ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM ALLOW 

7277
03:52:03,776 --> 03:52:06,479
PEOPLE TO USE THAT APP AS THEIR 

7278
03:52:06,479 --> 03:52:07,813
CLIENT FOR BOTH FACEBOOK 

7279
03:52:07,813 --> 03:52:08,580
MESSAGES AND TEXTS. 

7280
03:52:08,580 --> 03:52:11,283
SO WE DO ALLOW PEOPLE TO IMPORT 

7281
03:52:11,283 --> 03:52:12,952
THEIR TEXTS INTO THAT. 

7282
03:52:12,952 --> 03:52:13,352
>> OKAY. 

7283
03:52:13,352 --> 03:52:15,554
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT GOVERNMENT 

7284
03:52:15,554 --> 03:52:16,155
SURVEILLANCE. 

7285
03:52:16,155 --> 03:52:17,256
FOR YEARS FACEBOOK SAID THAT 

7286
03:52:17,256 --> 03:52:19,058
THERE SHOULD BE STRICT LIMITS 

7287
03:52:19,058 --> 03:52:22,661
ON THE INFORMATN THE 

7288
03:52:22,661 --> 03:52:23,362
GOVERNMENT CAN ACCESS ON 

7289
03:52:23,362 --> 03:52:26,365
AMERICANS AND BY THE WAY, I 

7290
03:52:26,365 --> 03:52:29,068
AGREED WITH YOU THAT BECAUSE 

7291
03:52:29,068 --> 03:52:30,836
PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO 

7292
03:52:30,836 --> 03:52:31,102
NEVADANS. 

7293
03:52:31,102 --> 03:52:32,004
YOU ARGUE THAT FACEBOOK USERS 

7294
03:52:32,004 --> 03:52:32,938
WOULDN'T TRUST YOU IF THEY 

7295
03:52:32,938 --> 03:52:36,042
THOUGHT YOU WERE GIVING THEIR 

7296
03:52:36,042 --> 03:52:38,244
PRIVATE INFORMATION TO THE 

7297
03:52:38,244 --> 03:52:39,078
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, YET YOU 

7298
03:52:39,078 --> 03:52:40,746
USE AND SELL THE SAME DATA TO 

7299
03:52:40,746 --> 03:52:42,748
MAKE MONEY AND IN THE CASE OF 

7300
03:52:42,748 --> 03:52:43,549
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA YOU DON'T 

7301
03:52:43,549 --> 03:52:45,985
EVEN KNOW HOW IT'S USED AFTER 

7302
03:52:45,985 --> 03:52:46,818
YOU SELL IT. 

7303
03:52:46,818 --> 03:52:50,256
CAN YOU TELL US WHY THIS ISN'T 

7304
03:52:50,256 --> 03:52:50,589
HYPOCRITICAL? 

7305
03:52:50,589 --> 03:52:51,557
>> WELL, SENATOR, ONCE AGAIN WE 

7306
03:52:51,557 --> 03:52:53,392
DON'T SELL ANY DATA TO ANYONE. 

7307
03:52:53,392 --> 03:52:54,760
WE DON'T SELL IT TO ADVERTISERS 

7308
03:52:54,760 --> 03:52:56,462
AND WE DON'T SELL IT TO 

7309
03:52:56,462 --> 03:52:56,862
DEVELOPERS. 

7310
03:52:56,862 --> 03:52:58,096
WHAT WE DO ALLOW IS FOR PEOPLE 

7311
03:52:58,096 --> 03:53:00,966
TO SIGN INTO APPS AND BRING 

7312
03:53:00,966 --> 03:53:02,668
THEIR DATA AND IT USED TO BE 

7313
03:53:02,668 --> 03:53:04,270
THE DATA OF SOME OF THEIR 

7314
03:53:04,270 --> 03:53:05,538
FRIEND, BUT NOW IT ISN'T WITH 

7315
03:53:05,538 --> 03:53:07,440
THEM AND THAT I THINK MAKE 

7316
03:53:07,440 --> 03:53:08,040
SENSE. 

7317
03:53:08,040 --> 03:53:08,774
THAT'S BASIC DATA PORTABILITY, 

7318
03:53:08,774 --> 03:53:10,576
THE ABILITY THAT YOU OWN THE 

7319
03:53:10,576 --> 03:53:10,776
DATA. 

7320
03:53:10,776 --> 03:53:12,778
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE IT 

7321
03:53:12,778 --> 03:53:13,813
FROM ONE APP TO ANOTHER IF 

7322
03:53:13,813 --> 03:53:14,113
YOU'D LIKE. 

7323
03:53:14,113 --> 03:53:15,681
>> DO YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE MORE 

7324
03:53:15,681 --> 03:53:18,884
RESPONSIBLE WITH MILLION OF 

7325
03:53:18,884 --> 03:53:20,186
AMERICANS' PERSONAL DATA THAN 

7326
03:53:20,186 --> 03:53:21,253
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD 

7327
03:53:21,253 --> 03:53:22,555
BE? 

7328
03:53:22,555 --> 03:53:23,589
>> YES. 

7329
03:53:26,358 --> 03:53:27,860
BUT, SENATOR, YOUR POINT ABOUT 

7330
03:53:27,860 --> 03:53:30,162
SURVEILLANCE, I THINK THAT 

7331
03:53:30,162 --> 03:53:31,097
THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT 

7332
03:53:31,097 --> 03:53:32,465
DISTINCTION TO DRAW HERE, WHICH 

7333
03:53:32,465 --> 03:53:34,967
IS THAT WHEN ORGANIZATIONS DO 

7334
03:53:34,967 --> 03:53:36,802
SURVEILLANCE, PEOPLE DON'T HAVE 

7335
03:53:36,802 --> 03:53:37,770
CONTROL OVER THAT. 

7336
03:53:37,770 --> 03:53:38,838
ON FACEBOOK EVERYTHING THAT YOU 

7337
03:53:38,838 --> 03:53:41,440
SHARE THERE, YOU HAVE CONTROL 

7338
03:53:41,440 --> 03:53:41,640
OVER. 

7339
03:53:41,640 --> 03:53:42,975
YOU CAN SAY I DON'T WANT THIS 

7340
03:53:42,975 --> 03:53:44,209
INFORMATION TO BE THERE. 

7341
03:53:44,209 --> 03:53:46,278
YOU HAVE FULL ACCESS TO 

7342
03:53:46,278 --> 03:53:47,480
UNDERSTAND EVERY PIECE OF 

7343
03:53:47,480 --> 03:53:48,280
INFORMATION THAT FACEBOOK MIGHT 

7344
03:53:48,280 --> 03:53:49,682
KNOW ABOUT YOU AND YOU CAN GET 

7345
03:53:49,682 --> 03:53:52,685
RID OF ALL OF IT AND I DON'T 

7346
03:53:52,685 --> 03:53:53,819
KNOW OF ANY SURVEILLANCE 

7347
03:53:53,819 --> 03:53:55,054
ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD THAT 

7348
03:53:55,054 --> 03:53:56,088
OPERATES THAT WAY, WHICH IS WHY 

7349
03:53:56,088 --> 03:53:58,290
I THINK THAT THAT COMPARISON 

7350
03:53:58,290 --> 03:53:59,158
JUST ISN'T REALLY APT HERE. 

7351
03:53:59,158 --> 03:54:00,593
>> WITH YOU HERE TODAY DO YOU 

7352
03:54:00,593 --> 03:54:02,060
THINK YOU'RE A VICTIM? 

7353
03:54:02,060 --> 03:54:02,427
>> NO. 

7354
03:54:02,427 --> 03:54:04,363
>> DO YOU THINK FACEBOOK AS A 

7355
03:54:04,363 --> 03:54:05,831
COMPANY IS A VICTIM? 

7356
03:54:05,831 --> 03:54:06,598
>> SENATOR, NO. 

7357
03:54:06,598 --> 03:54:08,667
I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBLE 

7358
03:54:08,667 --> 03:54:10,402
TO PROTECT EVERYONE IN OUR 

7359
03:54:10,402 --> 03:54:11,437
COMMUNITY FROM -- 

7360
03:54:11,437 --> 03:54:12,838
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 

7361
03:54:12,838 --> 03:54:13,839
EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY FROM 

7362
03:54:13,839 --> 03:54:15,674
ANYONE IN OUR ECOSYSTEM WHO IS 

7363
03:54:15,674 --> 03:54:17,076
GOING TO POTENTIALLY HARM THEM 

7364
03:54:17,076 --> 03:54:18,377
AND I THINK WE HAVEN'T DONE 

7365
03:54:18,377 --> 03:54:19,678
ENOUGH HISTORICALLY AND WE NEED 

7366
03:54:19,678 --> 03:54:20,679
TO STEP UP AND DO MORE. 

7367
03:54:20,679 --> 03:54:22,781
>> DO YOU CONSIDER THE 87 

7368
03:54:22,781 --> 03:54:25,550
MILLION USERS VICTIMS? 

7369
03:54:25,550 --> 03:54:27,686
>> SENATOR, I THINK YES. 

7370
03:54:27,686 --> 03:54:30,389
I MEAN THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR 

7371
03:54:30,389 --> 03:54:31,991
INFORMATION TO BE SOLD TO 

7372
03:54:31,991 --> 03:54:35,060
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA BY A 

7373
03:54:35,060 --> 03:54:36,695
DEVELOPER AND THAT HAPPENED AND 

7374
03:54:36,695 --> 03:54:38,030
IT HAPPENED ON OUR WATCH. 

7375
03:54:38,030 --> 03:54:39,564
SO EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T DO IT, 

7376
03:54:39,564 --> 03:54:40,766
I THINK WE HAVE A 

7377
03:54:40,766 --> 03:54:41,467
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO 

7378
03:54:41,467 --> 03:54:43,702
PREVENT THAT AND BE ABLE TO 

7379
03:54:43,702 --> 03:54:44,570
TAKE ACTION SOONER AND WE'RE 

7380
03:54:44,570 --> 03:54:45,538
COMMITTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

7381
03:54:45,538 --> 03:54:47,205
DO THAT GOING FORWARD, WHICH IS 

7382
03:54:47,205 --> 03:54:50,976
WHY THE STEPS THAT I ANNOUNCED 

7383
03:54:50,976 --> 03:54:52,978
BEFORE ARE NOW -- THE TWO MOST 

7384
03:54:52,978 --> 03:54:54,213
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE'RE 

7385
03:54:54,213 --> 03:54:54,880
DOING ARE LOCKING DOWN THE 

7386
03:54:54,880 --> 03:54:55,981
PLATFORM TO MAKE SURE 

7387
03:54:55,981 --> 03:54:57,783
DEVELOPERS CAN'T GET ACCESS TO 

7388
03:54:57,783 --> 03:54:59,685
THAT MUCH DATA SO THIS CAN'T 

7389
03:54:59,685 --> 03:55:00,486
HAPPEN AGAIN GOING FORWARD, 

7390
03:55:00,486 --> 03:55:02,488
WHICH I THINK IS LARGELY THE 

7391
03:55:02,488 --> 03:55:04,290
CASE SINCE 2014, AND GOING 

7392
03:55:04,290 --> 03:55:04,990
BACKWARDS WE NEED TO 

7393
03:55:04,990 --> 03:55:05,891
INVESTIGATION EVERY SINGLE APP 

7394
03:55:05,891 --> 03:55:07,593
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD ACCESS TO A 

7395
03:55:07,593 --> 03:55:09,160
LARGE ALL OF PEOPLE'S DATA TO 

7396
03:55:09,160 --> 03:55:11,297
MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS 

7397
03:55:11,297 --> 03:55:11,630
MISUSING IT. 

7398
03:55:11,630 --> 03:55:14,400
IF WE FIND THEY ARE, WE'RE 

7399
03:55:14,400 --> 03:55:15,768
GOING TO GET INTO THEIR 

7400
03:55:15,768 --> 03:55:18,170
SYSTMS, DO A FULL AUDIT, MAKE 

7401
03:55:18,170 --> 03:55:19,471
SURE THEY DELETE IT AND TELL 

7402
03:55:19,471 --> 03:55:20,939
EVERYONE WHO IS AFFECTED. 

7403
03:55:20,939 --> 03:55:22,374
>> WE'LL GO TO SENATOR PETERS 

7404
03:55:22,374 --> 03:55:24,209
AND THEN INTO THE BREAK AND 

7405
03:55:24,209 --> 03:55:26,679
SENATOR TILLIS COMING OUT OF 

7406
03:55:26,679 --> 03:55:27,346
THE BREAK. 

7407
03:55:27,346 --> 03:55:28,413
SO, SENATOR PETERS. 

7408
03:55:28,413 --> 03:55:30,248
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7409
03:55:30,248 --> 03:55:31,617
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANK YOU FOR 

7410
03:55:31,617 --> 03:55:32,718
BEING HERE TODAY. 

7411
03:55:32,718 --> 03:55:33,986
YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR VERY 

7412
03:55:33,986 --> 03:55:35,087
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS IN STARTING 

7413
03:55:35,087 --> 03:55:36,488
FACEBOOK IN YOUR DORM ROOM, 

7414
03:55:36,488 --> 03:55:37,723
WHICH I APPRECIATED THAT STORY, 

7415
03:55:37,723 --> 03:55:39,191
BUT CERTAINLY FACEBOOK HAS 

7416
03:55:39,191 --> 03:55:40,893
CHANGED AN AWFUL LOT OVER A 

7417
03:55:40,893 --> 03:55:42,394
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF 

7418
03:55:42,394 --> 03:55:42,594
TIME. 

7419
03:55:42,594 --> 03:55:45,097
WHEN FACEBOOK LAUNCHED ITS 

7420
03:55:45,097 --> 03:55:47,199
TIMELINE FEATURE, CONSUMERS SAW 

7421
03:55:47,199 --> 03:55:49,001
THEIR FRIENDS POST 

7422
03:55:49,001 --> 03:55:49,501
CHRONOLOGICALLY WAS THE 

7423
03:55:49,501 --> 03:55:50,703
PROCESS, BUT FACEBOOK HAS SINCE 

7424
03:55:50,703 --> 03:55:52,571
THEN CHANGED TO A TIMELINE 

7425
03:55:52,571 --> 03:55:56,175
DRIVEN BY SOME VERY 

7426
03:55:56,175 --> 03:55:56,809
SOPHISTICATED ALGORITHMS AND I 

7427
03:55:56,809 --> 03:55:58,577
THINK IT HAS LEFT MANY PEOPLE 

7428
03:55:58,577 --> 03:56:02,214
AS A RESULT OF THAT ASKING WHY 

7429
03:56:02,214 --> 03:56:04,383
AM I SEEING THIS FEED AND WHY 

7430
03:56:04,383 --> 03:56:07,086
AM I SEEING THIS RIGHT NOW? 

7431
03:56:07,086 --> 03:56:09,688
NOW IN LIGHT OF THE CAMBRIDGE 

7432
03:56:09,688 --> 03:56:10,789
ANALYTICA ISSUE FACEBOOK USERS 

7433
03:56:10,789 --> 03:56:14,193
ARE ASKING I THINK SOME NEW 

7434
03:56:14,193 --> 03:56:14,660
QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. 

7435
03:56:14,660 --> 03:56:15,995
CAN I BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING 

7436
03:56:15,995 --> 03:56:18,597
AND WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS 

7437
03:56:18,597 --> 03:56:19,364
INFORMATION ABOUT ME? 

7438
03:56:19,364 --> 03:56:21,767
SO I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY 

7439
03:56:21,767 --> 03:56:23,201
VERY SIMPLY THAT FACEBOOK IS 

7440
03:56:23,201 --> 03:56:25,638
LOSING THE TRUST OF AN AWFUL 

7441
03:56:25,638 --> 03:56:29,074
LOT OF AMERICANS AS A RESULT OF 

7442
03:56:29,074 --> 03:56:29,441
THIS INCIDENT. 

7443
03:56:29,441 --> 03:56:30,876
AND I THINK AN EXAMPLE OF THIS 

7444
03:56:30,876 --> 03:56:32,278
IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN 

7445
03:56:32,278 --> 03:56:33,779
HEARING A LOT FROM FOLKS WHO 

7446
03:56:33,779 --> 03:56:37,182
HAVE BEEN COMING UP TO ME AND 

7447
03:56:37,182 --> 03:56:38,784
TALKING ABOUT REALLY KIND OF AN 

7448
03:56:38,784 --> 03:56:40,286
EXPERIENCE THEY'VE HAD WHERE 

7449
03:56:40,286 --> 03:56:41,854
THEY'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION 

7450
03:56:41,854 --> 03:56:43,789
WITH FRIENDS, NOT ON THE PHONE, 

7451
03:56:43,789 --> 03:56:45,691
JUST TALKING, AND THEN THEY SEE 

7452
03:56:45,691 --> 03:56:47,259
ADS POPPING UP FAIRLY QUICKLY 

7453
03:56:47,259 --> 03:56:48,259
ON THEIR FACEBOOK. 

7454
03:56:48,259 --> 03:56:49,995
SO I'VE HEARD CONSTITUENTS FEAR 

7455
03:56:49,995 --> 03:56:52,398
THAT FACEBOOK IS MINING AUDIO 

7456
03:56:52,398 --> 03:56:54,566
FROM THEIR MOBILE DEVICES FOR 

7457
03:56:54,566 --> 03:56:56,468
THE PURPOSE OF AD TARGETING, 

7458
03:56:56,468 --> 03:56:57,169
WHICH I THINK SPEAKS TO THIS 

7459
03:56:57,169 --> 03:56:59,371
LACK OF TRUST THAT WE'RE SEEING 

7460
03:56:59,371 --> 03:56:59,672
HERE. 

7461
03:56:59,672 --> 03:57:00,873
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME 

7462
03:57:00,873 --> 03:57:02,141
TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL ISSUES 

7463
03:57:02,141 --> 03:57:04,977
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, BUT FOR THE 

7464
03:57:04,977 --> 03:57:06,979
RECORD, I THINK IT'S CLEAR AS I 

7465
03:57:06,979 --> 03:57:08,380
HEAR IT ALL THE TIME INCLUDING 

7466
03:57:08,380 --> 03:57:09,815
FROM MY OWN STAFF. 

7467
03:57:09,815 --> 03:57:11,583
YES OR NO, DOES FACEBOOK USE 

7468
03:57:11,583 --> 03:57:13,285
AUDIO OBTAINED FROM MOBILE 

7469
03:57:13,285 --> 03:57:14,920
DEVICES TO ENRICH PERSONAL 

7470
03:57:14,920 --> 03:57:17,556
INFORMATION ABOUT ITS USERS? 

7471
03:57:17,556 --> 03:57:17,790
>> NO. 

7472
03:57:17,790 --> 03:57:18,690
>> THE -- 

7473
03:57:18,690 --> 03:57:20,125
>> WELL, SENATOR, LET ME BE 

7474
03:57:20,125 --> 03:57:21,660
CLEAR ON THIS. 

7475
03:57:21,660 --> 03:57:24,697
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS 

7476
03:57:24,697 --> 03:57:25,497
CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT GETS 

7477
03:57:25,497 --> 03:57:27,700
PASSED AROUND THAT WE LISTEN TO 

7478
03:57:27,700 --> 03:57:28,267
WHAT'S GOING ON ON YOUR 

7479
03:57:28,267 --> 03:57:30,569
MICROPHONE AND USE THAT FOR 

7480
03:57:30,569 --> 03:57:30,769
ADS. 

7481
03:57:30,769 --> 03:57:31,036
>> RIGHT. 

7482
03:57:31,036 --> 03:57:31,970
>> WE DON'T DO THAT. 

7483
03:57:31,970 --> 03:57:33,939
TO BE CLEAR, WE DO ALLOW PEOPLE 

7484
03:57:33,939 --> 03:57:36,575
TO TAKE VIDEOS ON THEIR DEVICES 

7485
03:57:36,575 --> 03:57:39,110
AND SHARE THOSE AND, OF COURSE, 

7486
03:57:39,110 --> 03:57:40,979
VIDEOS ALSO HAVE AUDIOS, SO WE 

7487
03:57:40,979 --> 03:57:42,680
DO WHILE YOU'RE TAKING THE 

7488
03:57:42,680 --> 03:57:44,183
VIDEO RECORD THAT AND USE THAT 

7489
03:57:44,183 --> 03:57:45,284
TO MAKE THE SERVICE BETTER BY 

7490
03:57:45,284 --> 03:57:46,885
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR VIDEOS 

7491
03:57:46,885 --> 03:57:49,888
HAVE AUDIO, BUT I MEAN THAT I 

7492
03:57:49,888 --> 03:57:51,390
THINK IS PRETTY CLEAR, BUT I 

7493
03:57:51,390 --> 03:57:53,492
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS 

7494
03:57:53,492 --> 03:57:53,925
EXHAUSTIVE THERE. 

7495
03:57:53,925 --> 03:57:55,727
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

7496
03:57:55,727 --> 03:57:56,495
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL DISPEL A 

7497
03:57:56,495 --> 03:57:58,363
LOT OF WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING. 

7498
03:57:58,363 --> 03:57:59,998
SO THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. 

7499
03:57:59,998 --> 03:58:01,600
CERTAINLY TODAY IN THE ERA OF 

7500
03:58:01,600 --> 03:58:03,902
MEGA DATA WE ARE FINDING THAT 

7501
03:58:03,902 --> 03:58:07,506
DATA DRIVES EVERYTHING 

7502
03:58:07,506 --> 03:58:08,106
INCLUDING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. 

7503
03:58:08,106 --> 03:58:08,640
CONSUMER INFORMATION IS 

7504
03:58:08,640 --> 03:58:09,908
PROBABLY THE MOST VALUABLE 

7505
03:58:09,908 --> 03:58:14,179
INFORMATION YOU CAN GET IN THE 

7506
03:58:14,179 --> 03:58:15,981
DATA ECOSYSTEM AND AS YOU'VE 

7507
03:58:15,981 --> 03:58:16,715
MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY, 

7508
03:58:16,715 --> 03:58:18,584
PEOPLE LIKE THE FACT THEY CAN 

7509
03:58:18,584 --> 03:58:19,884
HAVE TARGETED ADS THEY'LL BE 

7510
03:58:19,884 --> 03:58:21,987
INTERESTED IN AS OPPOSED TO 

7511
03:58:21,987 --> 03:58:23,388
BEING BOMBARDED BY ADS THEY 

7512
03:58:23,388 --> 03:58:25,190
HAVE NO INTEREST IN AND THAT 

7513
03:58:25,190 --> 03:58:26,392
CONSUMER INFORMATION IS 

7514
03:58:26,392 --> 03:58:27,893
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO TAILOR 

7515
03:58:27,893 --> 03:58:28,894
THAT, BUT PEOPLE ARE NOW 

7516
03:58:28,894 --> 03:58:30,261
BEGINNING TO WONDER IS THERE AN 

7517
03:58:30,261 --> 03:58:31,196
EXPENSE TO THAT? 

7518
03:58:31,196 --> 03:58:32,931
WHEN IT COMES TO PERHAPS 

7519
03:58:32,931 --> 03:58:36,635
EXPOSING THEM TO BEING 

7520
03:58:36,635 --> 03:58:38,570
MANIPULATED OR THROUGH 

7521
03:58:38,570 --> 03:58:39,271
DECEPTION. 

7522
03:58:39,271 --> 03:58:39,972
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ARTIFICIAL 

7523
03:58:39,972 --> 03:58:40,939
INTELLIGENCE MANY TIMES DURING 

7524
03:58:40,939 --> 03:58:43,075
YOUR TESTIMONY AND I KNOW 

7525
03:58:43,075 --> 03:58:44,176
YOU'VE EMPLOYED SOME NEW 

7526
03:58:44,176 --> 03:58:45,577
ALGORITHMS TO TARGET BOTS, 

7527
03:58:45,577 --> 03:58:49,581
BRING DOWN FAKE ACCOUNTS, 

7528
03:58:49,581 --> 03:58:51,517
DEALING WITH TERRORISM, BUT YOU 

7529
03:58:51,517 --> 03:58:52,717
ALSO KNOW AI IS NOT WITHOUT 

7530
03:58:52,717 --> 03:58:54,987
RISK IN THAT YOU HAVE TO BE 

7531
03:58:54,987 --> 03:58:56,722
VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW 

7532
03:58:56,722 --> 03:58:57,489
THOSE ALGORITHMS ARE 

7533
03:58:57,489 --> 03:58:58,557
CONSTRUCTED. 

7534
03:58:58,557 --> 03:59:02,094
HOW DO YOU SEE ARTIFICIAL 

7535
03:59:02,094 --> 03:59:02,527
INTELLIGENCE, MORE 

7536
03:59:02,527 --> 03:59:03,395
SPECIFICALLY, DEALING  WITH THE 

7537
03:59:03,395 --> 03:59:05,830
ECOSYSTEM BY HELPING TO GET 

7538
03:59:05,830 --> 03:59:07,599
CONSUMER INSIGHTS, BUT ALSO 

7539
03:59:07,599 --> 03:59:09,902
KEEPING CONSUMER PRIVACY SAFE? 

7540
03:59:09,902 --> 03:59:11,770
>> SENATOR, I THINK THE CORE 

7541
03:59:11,770 --> 03:59:14,540
QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT AI 

7542
03:59:14,540 --> 03:59:15,807
TRANSPARENCY IS A REALLY 

7543
03:59:15,807 --> 03:59:17,109
IMPORTANT ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE 

7544
03:59:17,109 --> 03:59:18,710
JUST STARTING TO VERY SERIOUSLY 

7545
03:59:18,710 --> 03:59:20,778
STUDY AND THAT'S RAMPING UP A 

7546
03:59:20,778 --> 03:59:21,079
LOT. 

7547
03:59:21,079 --> 03:59:22,581
I THINK THIS WILL BE A VERY 

7548
03:59:22,581 --> 03:59:24,083
CENTRAL QUESTION FOR HOW WE 

7549
03:59:24,083 --> 03:59:26,051
THINK ABOUT AI SYSTEMS OVER THE 

7550
03:59:26,051 --> 03:59:27,018
NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND. 

7551
03:59:27,018 --> 03:59:30,889
RIGHT NOW A LOT OF OUR AI 

7552
03:59:30,889 --> 03:59:32,791
SYSTEMS MAKE DECISIONS IN WAYS 

7553
03:59:32,791 --> 03:59:34,326
THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY 

7554
03:59:34,326 --> 03:59:34,626
UNDERSTAND. 

7555
03:59:34,626 --> 03:59:34,893
>> RIGHT. 

7556
03:59:34,893 --> 03:59:37,095
>> AND I DON'T THINK THAT IN 10 

7557
03:59:37,095 --> 03:59:38,397
OR 20 YEARS IN THE FUTURE THAT 

7558
03:59:38,397 --> 03:59:41,200
WE ALL WANT TO BUILD WE WANT TO 

7559
03:59:41,200 --> 03:59:42,301
END UP WITH SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE 

7560
03:59:42,301 --> 03:59:45,571
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE 

7561
03:59:45,571 --> 03:59:46,171
MAKING DECISIONS. 

7562
03:59:46,171 --> 03:59:48,774
SO DOING THE RESEARCH NOW TO 

7563
03:59:48,774 --> 03:59:51,210
MAKE SURE THAT THESE SYSTEMS 

7564
03:59:51,210 --> 03:59:52,511
CAN HAVE THOSE PRINCIPLES AS 

7565
03:59:52,511 --> 03:59:53,512
WE'RE DEVELOPING THEM I THINK 

7566
03:59:53,512 --> 03:59:57,282
IS CERTAINLY AN EXTREMELY 

7567
03:59:57,282 --> 03:59:57,682
IMPORTANT THING. 

7568
03:59:57,682 --> 03:59:59,685
>> YOU BRING UP THE PRINCIPALS 

7569
03:59:59,685 --> 04:00:01,487
BECAUSE AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE, 

7570
04:00:01,487 --> 04:00:03,255
AI SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY IN VERY 

7571
04:00:03,255 --> 04:00:04,590
COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS WHEN YOU 

7572
04:00:04,590 --> 04:00:06,191
HAVE MACHINE LEARNING, IT'S 

7573
04:00:06,191 --> 04:00:07,092
SOMETIMES WE DIFFICULT TO 

7574
04:00:07,092 --> 04:00:08,460
UNDERSTAND AS YOU MENTIONED 

7575
04:00:08,460 --> 04:00:10,829
EXACTLY HOW THESE DECISIONS 

7576
04:00:10,829 --> 04:00:12,363
WERE ARRIVED AT. 

7577
04:00:12,363 --> 04:00:14,466
THERE'S EXAMPLES HOW ZIGS WERE 

7578
04:00:14,466 --> 04:00:15,968
MADE ON A DISCRIMINATORY BASIS 

7579
04:00:15,968 --> 04:00:17,503
AND THEY CAN COMPOUND IF YOU'RE 

7580
04:00:17,503 --> 04:00:21,340
NOT VERY CAREFUL HOW THAT  

7581
04:00:21,340 --> 04:00:22,541
OCCURS. 

7582
04:00:22,541 --> 04:00:25,210
YOU MENTIONED PRINCIPLES. 

7583
04:00:25,210 --> 04:00:26,344
IS YOUR COMPANY DEVELOPING A 

7584
04:00:26,344 --> 04:00:27,513
SET OF PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THAT 

7585
04:00:27,513 --> 04:00:31,216
DEVELOPMENT AND WOULD YOU GIVE 

7586
04:00:31,216 --> 04:00:32,417
DETAILS AS TO HOW THEY WILL 

7587
04:00:32,417 --> 04:00:34,219
HELP DEVELOP THE ISSUE? 

7588
04:00:34,219 --> 04:00:34,553
>> YES. 

7589
04:00:34,553 --> 04:00:35,821
I CAN FOLLOW UP AND GET YOU 

7590
04:00:35,821 --> 04:00:36,488
INFORMATION ON THAT. 

7591
04:00:36,488 --> 04:00:38,123
WE HAVE A WHOLE AI ETHICS TEAM 

7592
04:00:38,123 --> 04:00:39,658
THAT IS WORKING ON DEVELOPING 

7593
04:00:39,658 --> 04:00:40,592
BASICALLY THE TECHNOLOGY. 

7594
04:00:40,592 --> 04:00:42,528
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT 

7595
04:00:42,528 --> 04:00:43,195
PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES. 

7596
04:00:43,195 --> 04:00:44,429
IT'S ALSO A TECHNOLOGICAL 

7597
04:00:44,429 --> 04:00:45,330
FOUNDATION FOR MAKING SURE THIS 

7598
04:00:45,330 --> 04:00:46,898
GOES IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE 

7599
04:00:46,898 --> 04:00:47,099
WANT. 

7600
04:00:47,099 --> 04:00:47,699

7601
04:00:47,699 --> 04:00:49,668

BREACH, BUT MANY, MANY OTHER 

7613
04:01:11,723 --> 04:01:13,725
QUESTIONS WERE POSED REGARDING 

7614
04:01:13,725 --> 04:01:15,027
ISSUES ALL ACROSS THE TECH

7616
04:01:15,260 --> 04:01:18,130
I WANT TO BRING BACK OUR PANEL

OF CNET NEWS. 

7625
04:01:32,110 --> 04:01:34,012
GUYS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR 

7626
04:01:34,012 --> 04:01:36,080
STICKING WITH US, MARATHON 

7627
04:01:36,080 --> 04:01:37,816
AFTERNOON. 

7628
04:01:37,816 --> 04:01:38,383
THERE WERE SOME RECURRING 

7629
04:01:38,383 --> 04:01:39,851
THEMES WE KEEP HEARING COMING 

7630
04:01:39,851 --> 04:01:40,018
UP. 

7631
04:01:40,018 --> 04:01:42,521
ROGER, ONE OF THOSE THEMES IS 

7632
04:01:42,521 --> 04:01:44,923
AI, HOW AI SEEMS TO BE THE 

7633
04:01:44,923 --> 04:01:46,224
PANACEA THAT ZUCKERBERG IS 

7634
04:01:46,224 --> 04:01:48,126
POINTING TO THAT WILL SOLVE SO 

7635
04:01:48,126 --> 04:01:49,328
MANUFACTURE THESE ILLS, BUT 

7636
04:01:49,328 --> 04:01:51,229
HE'S NOT -- SO MANY OF THESE 

7637
04:01:51,229 --> 04:01:55,133
HIS, BUT HE'S NOT BEING 

7638
04:01:55,133 --> 04:01:55,400
SPECIFIC. 

7639
04:01:55,400 --> 04:01:56,635
>> HE'S THROWN AROUND THE TERM 

7640
04:01:56,635 --> 04:01:58,704
AI AS A SOLUTION FOR 

7641
04:01:58,704 --> 04:01:59,004
EVERYTHING. 

7642
04:01:59,004 --> 04:02:00,772
HE HASN'T BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT 

7643
04:02:00,772 --> 04:02:02,941
WHAT KIND OF AI, HOW IT WOULD 

7644
04:02:02,941 --> 04:02:04,075
WORK AND HASN'T REALLY TALKED 

7645
04:02:04,075 --> 04:02:05,476
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF AI. 

7646
04:02:05,476 --> 04:02:08,714
I BRING UP THE EXAMPLE OF 

7647
04:02:08,714 --> 04:02:09,715
MICROSOFT'S CHAT BOT THAT CAME 

7648
04:02:09,715 --> 04:02:11,917
OUT A FEW YEARS AGO. 

7649
04:02:11,917 --> 04:02:13,919
IT ONLY TOOK 24 HOURS BEFORE 

7650
04:02:13,919 --> 04:02:16,021
THAT FRIENDLY CHAT BOT BECAME 

7651
04:02:16,021 --> 04:02:17,022
THIS CRAZY RACIST PERSONALITY, 

7652
04:02:17,022 --> 04:02:18,223
WENT FROM EVERYTHING IS GREAT 

7653
04:02:18,223 --> 04:02:19,758
TO HITLER WAS RIGHT. 

7654
04:02:19,758 --> 04:02:21,827
>> SO AI LEARNS WHAT YOU FEED 

7655
04:02:21,827 --> 04:02:21,993
IT. 

7656
04:02:21,993 --> 04:02:25,330
IF YOU FEED IT THE WRONG THING 

7657
04:02:25,330 --> 04:02:28,734
EVEN ONCE, IT CAN CAUSE 

7658
04:02:28,734 --> 04:02:29,201
DISASTROUS RESULTS. 

7659
04:02:29,201 --> 04:02:30,335
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DAN? 

7660
04:02:30,335 --> 04:02:31,903
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

7661
04:02:31,903 --> 04:02:34,406
AI AND ALMOST EVERY EXPERT WE 

7662
04:02:34,406 --> 04:02:47,819
SPEAK TO AT TECH REPUBLIC URGES 

7663
04:02:47,819 --> 04:02:49,221
AGAINST USING AI BECAUSE THE 

7664
04:02:49,221 --> 04:02:50,555
WAY IT LEARNS HAS A LOT TO DO 

7665
04:02:50,555 --> 04:02:53,358
WITH THE VALUES AND THE WAY 

7666
04:02:53,358 --> 04:02:54,259
THAT YOU CODE. 

7667
04:02:54,259 --> 04:02:56,928
THAT'S ONE REASON ELON MUSK 

7668
04:02:56,928 --> 04:03:00,031
WARNS ABOUT ARTIFICIAL 

7669
04:03:00,031 --> 04:03:01,533
INTELLIGENCE AND USING IT AS A 

7670
04:03:01,533 --> 04:03:03,034
CATCH ALL FOR ALL CYBER 

7671
04:03:03,034 --> 04:03:04,636
SECURITY PROBLEMS IS SIMPLY NOT 

7672
04:03:04,636 --> 04:03:06,470
AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. 

7673
04:03:06,470 --> 04:03:06,938
>> RIGHT. 

7674
04:03:06,938 --> 04:03:07,806
JENNIFER, IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH 

7675
04:03:07,806 --> 04:03:09,074
OF THE SECURITY PROBLEMS GOING 

7676
04:03:09,074 --> 04:03:12,244
FORWARD WILL BE FIXED BY AI OR 

7677
04:03:12,244 --> 04:03:14,446
BY ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS THAT 

7678
04:03:14,446 --> 04:03:15,513
HAVE YET TO BE HIRED, CORRECT? 

7679
04:03:15,513 --> 04:03:17,749
>> I'VE SAID FOR A WHILE WE 

7680
04:03:17,749 --> 04:03:19,451
NEED WAY MORE HUMAN BEINGS 

7681
04:03:19,451 --> 04:03:20,351
BEHIND THESE PLATFORMS. 

7682
04:03:20,351 --> 04:03:21,720
I THINK EVERY TIME THEY GO INTO 

7683
04:03:21,720 --> 04:03:23,622
A CRISIS THEY SAY OH, WE HIRED 

7684
04:03:23,622 --> 04:03:25,256
A COUPLE THOUSAND MORE HUMANS. 

7685
04:03:25,256 --> 04:03:26,825
SO WE'RE SEEING THAT JUST NOW 

7686
04:03:26,825 --> 04:03:27,826
WITH 20,000 FACEBOOK IS 

7687
04:03:27,826 --> 04:03:29,227
REPORTING BY THE END OF THE 

7688
04:03:29,227 --> 04:03:33,031
YEAR, BUT WE HAVE 2 BILLION 

7689
04:03:33,031 --> 04:03:33,998
USERS THERE. 

7690
04:03:33,998 --> 04:03:35,133
20,000 CONTENT MODERATORS? 

7691
04:03:35,133 --> 04:03:35,767
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. 

7692
04:03:35,767 --> 04:03:38,603
>> A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE 

7693
04:03:38,603 --> 04:03:39,604
NEEDED. 

7694
04:03:39,604 --> 04:03:40,605
ANOTHER THING THAT ZUCKERBERG 

7695
04:03:40,605 --> 04:03:42,107
MENTIONED ALMOST FOUR TIMES BY 

7696
04:03:42,107 --> 04:03:43,942
MY DOWN, PERHAPS MORE, TALKED 

7697
04:03:43,942 --> 04:03:46,144
ABOUT THIS BEING A -- COUNT, 

7698
04:03:46,144 --> 04:03:48,814
PERHAPS MORE, TALKED ABOUT THIS 

7699
04:03:48,814 --> 04:03:50,515
BEING A COMPANY I STARTED WAY 

7700
04:03:50,515 --> 04:03:54,119
BACK IN MY DORM ROOM, AW 

7701
04:03:54,119 --> 04:03:58,890
SHUCKS, IT GOT AWAY FROM ME 

7702
04:03:58,890 --> 04:04:00,158
AND, JEN, YOU MENTIONED HE'S 

7703
04:04:00,158 --> 04:04:02,394
KIND OF FALLING BACK ON 

7704
04:04:02,394 --> 04:04:02,661
HARVARD. 

7705
04:04:02,661 --> 04:04:04,129
>> HE'S KIND OF RELYING ON 

7706
04:04:04,129 --> 04:04:04,429
THAT. 

7707
04:04:04,429 --> 04:04:06,031
HE WAS GIVEN AN HONORARY DEGREE 

7708
04:04:06,031 --> 04:04:07,532
A FEW YEARS AGO EVEN THOUGH HE 

7709
04:04:07,532 --> 04:04:09,034
DIDN'T COMPLETE HIS STUDIES 

7710
04:04:09,034 --> 04:04:10,936
THERE, BUT HE'S KIND OF THE 

7711
04:04:10,936 --> 04:04:12,604
POSTER CHILD OF SUCCESSFUL. 

7712
04:04:12,604 --> 04:04:14,239
>> HE'S BEEN FORGIVEN FOR THAT 

7713
04:04:14,239 --> 04:04:14,639
AT THIS POINT. 

7714
04:04:14,639 --> 04:04:16,541
>> I THINK HE'S RELYING ON HIS 

7715
04:04:16,541 --> 04:04:18,343
LEGACY THERE AND THE 

7716
04:04:18,343 --> 04:04:20,145
INSTITUTIONAL CONNECTION HE'S 

7717
04:04:20,145 --> 04:04:20,778
TRYING TO ASSIMILATE WITH 

7718
04:04:20,778 --> 04:04:27,018
HARVARD TO BUILD THIS INTO HIS  

7719
04:04:27,018 --> 04:04:27,285
PERSONA. 

7720
04:04:27,285 --> 04:04:27,585
I'M SMART. 

7721
04:04:27,585 --> 04:04:28,119
I CAN BE TRUSSED. 

7722
04:04:28,119 --> 04:04:30,222
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST 

7723
04:04:30,222 --> 04:04:30,555
-- TRUSTED. 

7724
04:04:30,555 --> 04:04:33,425
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST 

7725
04:04:33,425 --> 04:04:34,191
AMERICAN STORIES. 

7726
04:04:34,191 --> 04:04:35,227
THEY'RE ALL SENSITIVE TO THAT 

7727
04:04:35,227 --> 04:04:36,528
FACT THIS IS AN AMERICAN 

7728
04:04:36,528 --> 04:04:36,795
COMPANY. 

7729
04:04:36,795 --> 04:04:37,929
>> THEY'RE ALL GOING TO COLLEGE 

7730
04:04:37,929 --> 04:04:39,331
AND SAYING I WANT MY KID TO 

7731
04:04:39,331 --> 04:04:41,433
COME UP WITH FACEBOOK IN THEIR 

7732
04:04:41,433 --> 04:04:41,733
DORM ROOM. 

7733
04:04:41,733 --> 04:04:42,934
ANOTHER THEME THAT KEPT COMING 

7734
04:04:42,934 --> 04:04:45,904
UP WAS THIS OPT IN VERSUS OPT 

7735
04:04:45,904 --> 04:04:46,537
OUT MODEL. 

7736
04:04:46,537 --> 04:04:47,806
EUROPE ADOPTED THE OPT IN 

7737
04:04:47,806 --> 04:04:49,107
MODEL. 

7738
04:04:49,107 --> 04:04:50,542
YOU HAVE TO ACTIVELY OPT IN TO 

7739
04:04:50,542 --> 04:04:52,377
HAVE YOUR DATA SHARED. 

7740
04:04:52,377 --> 04:04:54,146
HE WAS ASKED BY SEVERAL 

7741
04:04:54,146 --> 04:04:55,380
SENATORS IF HE WOULD SUPPORT 

7742
04:04:55,380 --> 04:04:56,815
SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN THE U.S. 

7743
04:04:56,815 --> 04:04:58,216
DAN, WE ALMOST GOT HIM TO SAY 

7744
04:04:58,216 --> 04:05:00,084
YES AT ONE POINT, CORRECT? 

7745
04:05:00,084 --> 04:05:01,786
>> WELL, I THINK HE KIND OF 

7746
04:05:01,786 --> 04:05:04,021
KNOWS WHEN WOULD BE A SAFER 

7747
04:05:04,021 --> 04:05:06,524
SOLUTION FOR THE VAST MAJORITY 

7748
04:05:06,524 --> 04:05:09,661
OF HIS 2 BILLION USERS, BUT, OF 

7749
04:05:09,661 --> 04:05:12,931
COURSE, OPT IN IS NOT -- IT 

7750
04:05:12,931 --> 04:05:17,169
DOESN'T HELP THE SHARE PRICE GO 

7751
04:05:17,169 --> 04:05:19,004
UP AND REALLY OPT IN COULD BE 

7752
04:05:19,004 --> 04:05:19,638
SOMETHING THAT WOULD INHIBIT 

7753
04:05:19,638 --> 04:05:27,646
THE GROWTH OF A SOCIAL NETWORK.

7754
04:05:27,646 --> 04:05:29,247
WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT FASTER 

7755
04:05:29,247 --> 04:05:32,450
NOTIFICATIONS AND FASTER 

7756
04:05:32,450 --> 04:05:32,717
COMMENTS. 

7757
04:05:32,717 --> 04:05:34,853
AN OPT IN MIGHT BE MORE PASSIVE 

7758
04:05:34,853 --> 04:05:36,555
AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING YOU'D 

7759
04:05:36,555 --> 04:05:37,288
ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN. 

7760
04:05:37,288 --> 04:05:39,057
>> AT THE END HE SAID I LOOK 

7761
04:05:39,057 --> 04:05:42,327
FORWARD TO KNOW ITING THIS 

7762
04:05:42,327 --> 04:05:50,101
CONVERSATION WITH MY TEAM -- TO 

7763
04:05:50,101 --> 04:05:52,204
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH 

7764
04:05:52,204 --> 04:05:52,504
MY TEAM. 

7765
04:05:52,504 --> 04:05:54,206
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 

7766
04:05:54,206 --> 04:05:56,140
CAVEATS AND A LOT OF PUTS AND 

7767
04:05:56,140 --> 04:05:58,376
TAKES WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT 

7768
04:05:58,376 --> 04:05:59,710
THIS WILL LOOK LIKE ACTUALLY. 

7769
04:05:59,710 --> 04:06:01,847
>> I WANT TO PLAY, WHEN WE CAN 

7770
04:06:01,847 --> 04:06:03,814
BRING IT UP, THE SOUND FROM I 

7771
04:06:03,814 --> 04:06:06,151
THOUGHT ONE OF THE MORE 

7772
04:06:06,151 --> 04:06:07,251
HUMOROUS EXCHANGES WHEN SENATOR 

7773
04:06:07,251 --> 04:06:09,254
DURBIN ASKED IF HE WOULD BE 

7774
04:06:09,254 --> 04:06:10,488
WILLING TO SHARE INFORMATION ON 

7775
04:06:10,488 --> 04:06:11,556
THE HOTEL HE STALED IN LAST 

7776
04:06:11,556 --> 04:06:14,159
NIGHT AND WHO HE WAS 

7777
04:06:14,159 --> 04:06:15,327
MESSENGERING THIS AFTERNOON AND 

7778
04:06:15,327 --> 04:06:17,429
HE LOOKED SURPRISED AND SAID 

7779
04:06:17,429 --> 04:06:17,629
NO. 

7780
04:06:17,629 --> 04:06:18,763
>> WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE 

7781
04:06:18,763 --> 04:06:20,131
SHARING WITH US THE NAME OF THE 

7782
04:06:20,131 --> 04:06:28,907
HOTEL YOU STAYED IN LAST NIGHT? 

7783
04:06:28,907 --> 04:06:32,310
>> NO. 

7784
04:06:32,310 --> 04:06:33,444
>> IF YOU'VE MESSAGED ANYBODY 

7785
04:06:33,444 --> 04:06:34,712
WITH US THIS WEEK, WOULD YOU 

7786
04:06:34,712 --> 04:06:38,149
SHARE WITH US THE NAMES OF THE 

7787
04:06:38,149 --> 04:06:38,783
PEOPLE YOU MESSAGED? 

7788
04:06:38,783 --> 04:06:39,651
>> SENATOR, NO, I WOULD 

7789
04:06:39,651 --> 04:06:41,419
PROBABLY NOT CHOOSE TO DO THAT 

7790
04:06:41,419 --> 04:06:42,153
PUBLICLY HERE. 

7791
04:06:42,153 --> 04:06:42,888
>> I THINK THAT MIGHT WHAT 

7792
04:06:42,888 --> 04:06:48,660
ABOUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, YOUR 

7793
04:06:48,660 --> 04:06:50,061
RIGHT TO PRIVACY, THE LIMITS OF 

7794
04:06:50,061 --> 04:06:51,363
YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND HOW 

7795
04:06:51,363 --> 04:06:52,631
MUCH YOU GIVE AWAY IN MODERN 

7796
04:06:52,631 --> 04:06:54,132
AMERICA IN THE NAME OF 

7797
04:06:54,132 --> 04:06:56,934
"CONNECTING PEOPLE AROUND THE 

7798
04:06:56,934 --> 04:06:57,869
WORLD." 

7799
04:06:57,869 --> 04:07:00,105
THE QUESTION BASICALLY OF WHAT 

7800
04:07:00,105 --> 04:07:00,605
INFORMATION FACEBOOK'S 

7801
04:07:00,605 --> 04:07:01,506
CHECKING, WHO THEY'RE SENDING 

7802
04:07:01,506 --> 04:07:05,377
IT TO AND WHETHER THEY WERE 

7803
04:07:05,377 --> 04:07:06,077
ASKING IN ADVANCE MY PERMISSION 

7804
04:07:06,077 --> 04:07:07,445
TO DO THAT. 

7805
04:07:07,445 --> 04:07:09,247
IS THAT A FAIR THING FOR A USER 

7806
04:07:09,247 --> 04:07:10,715
OF FACEBOOK TO EXPECT? 

7807
04:07:10,715 --> 04:07:11,816
>> YES, SENATOR. 

7808
04:07:11,816 --> 04:07:12,851
I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE 

7809
04:07:12,851 --> 04:07:14,452
CONTROL OVER HOW THEIR 

7810
04:07:14,452 --> 04:07:16,054
INFORMATION IS USED AND AS 

7811
04:07:16,054 --> 04:07:17,455
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN SOME OF 

7812
04:07:17,455 --> 04:07:20,158
THE OTHER QUESTIONS, I THINK 

7813
04:07:20,158 --> 04:07:21,459
THAT THAT IS LAID OUT IN SOME 

7814
04:07:21,459 --> 04:07:22,927
OF THE DOCUMENTS, BUT MORE 

7815
04:07:22,927 --> 04:07:23,862
IMPORTANTLY, YOU WANT TO GIVE 

7816
04:07:23,862 --> 04:07:26,264
PEOPLE CONTROL IN THE PRODUCT 

7817
04:07:26,264 --> 04:07:26,497
ITSELF. 

7818
04:07:26,497 --> 04:07:27,866
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY THAT 

7819
04:07:27,866 --> 04:07:30,468
THIS HAPPENS ACROSS OUR 

7820
04:07:30,468 --> 04:07:31,536
SERVICES IS THAT EVERY DAY 

7821
04:07:31,536 --> 04:07:32,938
PEOPLE COME TO OUR SERVICES TO 

7822
04:07:32,938 --> 04:07:34,940
CHOOSE TO SHARE PHOTOS OR SEND 

7823
04:07:34,940 --> 04:07:37,175
MESSAGES AND EVERY SINGLE TIME 

7824
04:07:37,175 --> 04:07:38,710
THEY CHOOSE TO SHARE SOMETHING 

7825
04:07:38,710 --> 04:07:39,978
THEY HAVE A CONTROL RIGHT THERE 

7826
04:07:39,978 --> 04:07:43,148
ABOUT WHO THEY WANT TO SHARE IT 

7827
04:07:43,148 --> 04:07:43,648
WITH. 

7828
04:07:43,648 --> 04:07:44,549
>> SEEMS SENATOR DURBIN CAUGHT 

7829
04:07:44,549 --> 04:07:46,684
HIM A LITTLE OFF GUARD THERE. 

7830
04:07:46,684 --> 04:07:47,953
HIS PR TEAM DIDN'T PREPARE HIM 

7831
04:07:47,953 --> 04:07:48,820
FOR THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION 

7832
04:07:48,820 --> 04:07:51,156
WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 

7833
04:07:51,156 --> 04:07:52,590
THE FIRST ONE THEY TOLD HIM TO 

7834
04:07:52,590 --> 04:07:53,558
BE PREPARED FOR. 

7835
04:07:53,558 --> 04:07:58,063
>> YOU CAN ALMOST SEE A GIVE OF 

7836
04:07:58,063 --> 04:08:00,065
STAR WARS AND ADMIRAL AKBAR 

7837
04:08:00,065 --> 04:08:02,567
GOING IT'S A TRAP! 

7838
04:08:02,567 --> 04:08:06,604
>> ASIDE FROM THAT QUESTION -- 

7839
04:08:06,604 --> 04:08:08,640
A GIFF OF STAR WARS AND ADMIRAL 

7840
04:08:08,640 --> 04:08:13,344
AKBAR GOING IT'S A TRAP! 

7841
04:08:13,344 --> 04:08:15,747
>> I THINK ANY TIME THERE WAS A 

7842
04:08:15,747 --> 04:08:17,215
SLIGHT MISWORDING OF A QUESTION 

7843
04:08:17,215 --> 04:08:18,315
HE POUNCED ON IT. 

7844
04:08:18,315 --> 04:08:19,951
HE KEPT ASKING FOR 

7845
04:08:19,951 --> 04:08:20,318
CLARIFICATION. 

7846
04:08:20,318 --> 04:08:22,187
HE KIND OF SAID I DIDN'T 

7847
04:08:22,187 --> 04:08:22,554
UNDERSTAND. 

7848
04:08:22,554 --> 04:08:23,021
COULD YOU CLARIFY. 

7849
04:08:23,021 --> 04:08:24,756
COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION 

7850
04:08:24,756 --> 04:08:25,957
AND REALLY FORCED SOME OF THE 

7851
04:08:25,957 --> 04:08:27,559
SENATORS TO STUMBLE UPON WHAT 

7852
04:08:27,559 --> 04:08:28,092
THEY WERE ASKING. 

7853
04:08:28,092 --> 04:08:30,762
>> A COUPLE TIMES I ALMOST FELT 

7854
04:08:30,762 --> 04:08:32,964
HE WAS WILLFULLY PLAYING DUMB, 

7855
04:08:32,964 --> 04:08:34,766
FOR INSTANCE, WHEN HE WAS ASKED 

7856
04:08:34,766 --> 04:08:36,668
ABOUT THE EXACT NUMBER OF DATA 

7857
04:08:36,668 --> 04:08:38,169
POINTS FACEBOOK COLLECTS, WHAT 

7858
04:08:38,169 --> 04:08:39,537
CATEGORIES OF DATA POINTS. 

7859
04:08:39,537 --> 04:08:43,375
I THOUGHT IT WAS CLEAR WHAT THE 

7860
04:08:43,375 --> 04:08:45,477
SENATOR WAS ASKING, BUT HE WAS 

7861
04:08:45,477 --> 04:08:47,445
SIDESTEPPING THE ISSUE AND 

7862
04:08:47,445 --> 04:08:48,346
ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON 

7863
04:08:48,346 --> 04:08:49,748
POST, FACEBOOK DOES COLLECT A 

7864
04:08:49,748 --> 04:08:50,849
LARGE NUMBER OF INFORMATION 

7865
04:08:50,849 --> 04:08:52,851
INCLUDING THING LIKE THE SQUARE 

7866
04:08:52,851 --> 04:08:54,485
FOOTAGE OF YOUR HOME, RIGHT? 

7867
04:08:54,485 --> 04:08:55,586
THOSE ARE DATA POINTS. 

7868
04:08:55,586 --> 04:08:58,390
WE ARE GOING TO BRING IN CBS 

7869
04:08:58,390 --> 04:08:59,324
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ED O'KEEFE 

7870
04:08:59,324 --> 04:08:59,757
FROM WASHINGTON. 

7871
04:08:59,757 --> 04:09:02,560
WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR TAKE-AWAY 

7872
04:09:02,560 --> 04:09:03,461
FROM THIS HEARING TODAY? 

7873
04:09:03,461 --> 04:09:05,964
>> Reporter:  I THINK IT'S 

7874
04:09:05,964 --> 04:09:06,865
INTERESTING, TANYA, BECAUSE IF 

7875
04:09:06,865 --> 04:09:09,267
YOU WERE SOMEONE WHO MAYBE 

7876
04:09:09,267 --> 04:09:10,435
DOESN'T ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND HOW 

7877
04:09:10,435 --> 04:09:12,103
FACEBOOK WORKS, YOU'VE 

7878
04:09:12,103 --> 04:09:13,238
CERTAINLY GOTTEN A TUTORIAL ON 

7879
04:09:13,238 --> 04:09:15,039
THAT AND FREQUENT REMINDERS 

7880
04:09:15,039 --> 04:09:15,940
FROM ZUCKERBERG ABOUT WHAT IT 

7881
04:09:15,940 --> 04:09:17,475
IS YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO AND 

7882
04:09:17,475 --> 04:09:20,211
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN OPT OUT 

7883
04:09:20,211 --> 04:09:22,147
OR DECIDE NOT TO SHARE CERTAIN 

7884
04:09:22,147 --> 04:09:26,351
THINGS AND HE'S DONE THAT 

7885
04:09:26,351 --> 04:09:27,452
SOMEWHAT REPEATEDLY BUT PERHAPS 

7886
04:09:27,452 --> 04:09:28,553
NOT AS CLEARLY AS SOME OF OTHER 

7887
04:09:28,553 --> 04:09:30,155
THINGS HE WAS TRYING TO SAY. 

7888
04:09:30,155 --> 04:09:32,223
I THINK HE'S PERHAPS LOST AN 

7889
04:09:32,223 --> 04:09:33,058
OPPORTUNITY TO REMIND FOLKS 

7890
04:09:33,058 --> 04:09:36,961
YEAH, USERS MAY BE VICTIMS AS 

7891
04:09:36,961 --> 04:09:37,762
SENATOR DEAN HELLER SUGGESTED 

7892
04:09:37,762 --> 04:09:40,365
TO HIM, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A 

7893
04:09:40,365 --> 04:09:41,666
CHOICE HERE EXACTLY HOW MUCH 

7894
04:09:41,666 --> 04:09:43,000
THEY WANT TO SHARE. 

7895
04:09:43,000 --> 04:09:44,602
THE OTHER THING I'M SURE IS 

7896
04:09:44,602 --> 04:09:45,937
FRUSTRATING TO SOME IS WE'VE 

7897
04:09:45,937 --> 04:09:47,639
GOTTEN NO REAL SENSE FROM HIM 

7898
04:09:47,639 --> 04:09:49,640
AT LEAST PUBLICLY HERE ON THE 

7899
04:09:49,640 --> 04:09:51,042
RECORD OF WHAT HE THINKS 

7900
04:09:51,042 --> 04:09:52,410
úCONGR 

7901
04:09:52,410 --> 04:09:53,144
IN RESPONSE. 

7902
04:09:55,180 --> 04:09:56,581
THIS WHOLE WE'LL GET MY STAFF 

7903
04:09:56,581 --> 04:09:58,316
TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, 

7904
04:09:58,316 --> 04:09:59,350
THAT GOES NOWHERE. 

7905
04:09:59,350 --> 04:10:01,686
IF YOU WERE SOMEBODY HOPING HE 

7906
04:10:01,686 --> 04:10:04,289
WOULD CLARIFY WHAT HE THINKS 

7907
04:10:04,289 --> 04:10:05,890
AND WHAT OTHERS IN SILICON 

7908
04:10:05,890 --> 04:10:06,991
VALLEY MIGHT THINK SHOULD BE 

7909
04:10:06,991 --> 04:10:09,360
DONE, IT'S NOT HAPPENING. 

7910
04:10:09,360 --> 04:10:10,295
THAT'S UNDOUBTEDLY ON THE 

7911
04:10:10,295 --> 04:10:11,863
ADVICE OF THE FOLKS THAT 

7912
04:10:11,863 --> 04:10:13,063
PREPARED HIM FOR THAT THAT YOU 

7913
04:10:13,063 --> 04:10:14,199
DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THE 

7914
04:10:14,199 --> 04:10:15,700
RABBIT HOLE OF GETTING TOO 

7915
04:10:15,700 --> 04:10:16,901
SPECIFIC BECAUSE IT MAY TURN 

7916
04:10:16,901 --> 04:10:18,570
OUT WHAT YOU WERE THINKING OF 

7917
04:10:18,570 --> 04:10:20,839
THAT DAY ISN'T WHAT IS PASSED 

7918
04:10:20,839 --> 04:10:22,674
OR DOESN'T ULTIMATELY MAKE 

7919
04:10:22,674 --> 04:10:23,107
SENSE. 

7920
04:10:23,107 --> 04:10:23,808
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING. 

7921
04:10:23,808 --> 04:10:28,179
I THINK IT POINT OUT SOME OF 

7922
04:10:28,179 --> 04:10:30,081
THE GENERATIONAL AND 

7923
04:10:30,081 --> 04:10:31,382
TECHNOLOGICAL DIVIDES WHICH 

7924
04:10:31,382 --> 04:10:32,884
EXISTS BETWEEN SOME MEMBERS OF 

7925
04:10:32,884 --> 04:10:33,484
CONGRESS AND MR. ZUCKERBERG, 

7926
04:10:33,484 --> 04:10:36,187
BUT IN SOME WAYS THOSE 

7927
04:10:36,187 --> 04:10:37,422
LAWMAKERS ARE REFLECTIVE OF 

7928
04:10:37,422 --> 04:10:38,890
PROBABLY A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF 

7929
04:10:38,890 --> 04:10:40,124
FACEBOOK USERS WHO DON'T 

7930
04:10:40,124 --> 04:10:40,992
ENTIRELY COMPREHEND WHAT THEY 

7931
04:10:40,992 --> 04:10:42,026
ARE PART OF. 

7932
04:10:42,026 --> 04:10:44,028
>> DAN, ONE THING I DIDN'T 

7933
04:10:44,028 --> 04:10:45,296
THINK WAS SATISFACTORILY 

7934
04:10:45,296 --> 04:10:46,765
ANSWERED TODAY WAS WHAT NOW 

7935
04:10:46,765 --> 04:10:48,399
HAPPENS TO ALL THE INFORMATION 

7936
04:10:48,399 --> 04:10:48,699
OUT THERE? 

7937
04:10:48,699 --> 04:10:50,801
IT DOESN'T GET CLAWED BACK. 

7938
04:10:50,801 --> 04:10:51,803
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA MAY OR MAY 

7939
04:10:51,803 --> 04:10:53,637
NOT HAVE IT. 

7940
04:10:53,637 --> 04:10:54,205
WHERE IS IT? 

7941
04:10:54,205 --> 04:10:56,374
FACEBOOK CAN DO WHATEVER IT 

7942
04:10:56,374 --> 04:10:57,075
WANTS GOING FORWARD, BUT 

7943
04:10:57,075 --> 04:10:58,510
THERE'S STILL MILLIONS AND 

7944
04:10:58,510 --> 04:11:01,813
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO FEEL 

7945
04:11:01,813 --> 04:11:07,518
LIKE THEIR DATA IS OUT THERE. 

7946
04:11:07,518 --> 04:11:08,286
>> YEAH. 

7947
04:11:08,286 --> 04:11:09,587
AND HE HAS NOT NECESSARILY 

7948
04:11:09,587 --> 04:11:12,090
GIVEN A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT. 

7949
04:11:12,090 --> 04:11:13,691
THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT WAS 

7950
04:11:13,691 --> 04:11:15,493
INTERESTING WAS WE HAD A FEW 

7951
04:11:15,493 --> 04:11:17,896
QUESTIONS ABOUT CONTENT AND WHO 

7952
04:11:17,896 --> 04:11:19,297
WAS SHARING THAT, SPECIFICALLY 

7953
04:11:19,297 --> 04:11:20,198
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS OR THOUGHTS 

7954
04:11:20,198 --> 04:11:22,300
POLICE AND THINGS NOT DONE TO 

7955
04:11:22,300 --> 04:11:24,802
STOP HATE SPEECH IN TERM OF 

7956
04:11:24,802 --> 04:11:25,069
OTHERS. 

7957
04:11:25,069 --> 04:11:26,738
IT'S TELLING TO -- TERMS OF 

7958
04:11:26,738 --> 04:11:27,038
OTHERS. 

7959
04:11:27,038 --> 04:11:28,773
IT'S TELLING TO ME THAT IT'S 

7960
04:11:28,773 --> 04:11:29,741
COMING FROM SENATORS LIKE TED 

7961
04:11:29,741 --> 04:11:32,010
CRUZ AND BEN SASSE, REPUBLICANS 

7962
04:11:32,010 --> 04:11:33,478

BROADER POLITICAL AMBITIONS AND 

7966
04:11:38,382 --> 04:11:39,684

7968
04:11:43,821 --> 04:11:46,691
BRINGING THIS UP AND RAISING 

7969
04:11:46,691 --> 04:11:47,692
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW CERTAIN 

7970
04:11:47,692 --> 04:11:49,394
POLITICAL SPEECH IS HANDLED ON 

7971
04:11:49,394 --> 04:11:50,928
FACEBOOK, THEY MAY BE SCORING 

7972
04:11:50,928 --> 04:11:53,197
POINT WITH THEIR PARTY BASE. 

7973
04:11:53,197 --> 04:11:54,299
IT'S INTERESTING A FEW SENATORS 

7974
04:11:54,299 --> 04:11:55,099
THROUGHOUT THIS HAVE AT LEAST 

7975
04:11:55,099 --> 04:11:57,602
TAKEN AN OPPORTUNITY THERE TO 

7976
04:11:57,602 --> 04:11:58,770
DEFEND SOME MEMBERS OF THEIR 

7977
04:11:58,770 --> 04:11:59,571
IDEOLOGICAL FLANKS AND USE IT 

7978
04:11:59,571 --> 04:12:01,573
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF 

7979
04:12:01,573 --> 04:12:06,477
HIT ZUCKERBERG WITH THAT, BUT 

7980
04:12:06,477 --> 04:12:07,812
AGAIN VERY FEW DETAILS 

7981
04:12:07,812 --> 04:12:08,846
OTHERWISE ON WHAT EXACTLY 

7982
04:12:08,846 --> 04:12:10,582
CONGRESS MIGHT DO NECK AND WHAT

FACEBOOK IS WILLING TO -- NEXT 

7984
04:12:11,783 --> 04:12:13,117
AND WHAT FACEBOOK IS WILLING TO 

7985
04:12:13,117 --> 04:12:15,019
DO WITH THEM TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. 

7986
04:12:15,019 --> 04:12:17,922
>> ED O'KEEFE, THANK YOU SO 

7987
04:12:17,922 --> 04:12:18,122

SENATORS. 

8021
04:15:25,610 --> 04:15:25,910
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

8022
04:15:27,111 --> 04:15:28,613
>> THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN PROUDLY 

8023
04:15:28,613 --> 04:15:29,714
TWEETED FACEBOOK WAS SURPRISED 

8024
04:15:29,714 --> 04:15:33,418
WE WERE ABLE TO SUCK OUT THE 

8025
04:15:33,418 --> 04:15:34,318
WHOLE SOCIAL GRAPH, BUT THEY 

8026
04:15:34,318 --> 04:15:35,820
DIDN'T STOP US ONCE THEY 

8027
04:15:35,820 --> 04:15:38,122
REALIZED THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE 

8028
04:15:38,122 --> 04:15:38,523
DOING. 

8029
04:15:38,523 --> 04:15:40,825
SO YOU CLEARLY HAD SOME PEOPLE 

8030
04:15:40,825 --> 04:15:42,493
IN YOUR EMPLOY THAT APPARENTLY 

8031
04:15:42,493 --> 04:15:42,893
KNEW IT. 

8032
04:15:42,893 --> 04:15:44,195
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THIS 

8033
04:15:44,195 --> 04:15:45,430
PERSON SAID ON TWITTER AND 

8034
04:15:45,430 --> 04:15:46,664
THANK GOODNESS FOR WAY BACK AND 

8035
04:15:46,664 --> 04:15:48,800
SOME OF THE OTHER HISTORY GRAB 

8036
04:15:48,800 --> 04:15:49,333
ERMA SHEENS. 

8037
04:15:49,333 --> 04:15:54,738
I'M SURE WE CAN -- GRABBER 

8038
04:15:54,738 --> 04:15:55,005
MACHINES. 

8039
04:15:55,005 --> 04:15:56,640
I THINK WE CAN GO BACK AND GET 

8040
04:15:56,640 --> 04:15:58,075
IT IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT. 

8041
04:15:58,075 --> 04:16:00,011
I WORKED IN DATA ANALYTICS 

8042
04:16:00,011 --> 04:16:01,612
PRACTICE A GOOD PART OF MY 

8043
04:16:01,612 --> 04:16:03,014
CAREER AND FOR ANYBODY TO 

8044
04:16:03,014 --> 04:16:04,115
PRETEND CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WAS 

8045
04:16:04,115 --> 04:16:05,817
THE FIRST PERSON TO EXPLOIT 

8046
04:16:05,817 --> 04:16:07,318
DATA CLEARLY HASN'T WORKED IN 

8047
04:16:07,318 --> 04:16:08,452
THE DATA ANALYTICS FIELD. 

8048
04:16:08,452 --> 04:16:10,021
SO WHEN YOU GO BACK AND DO YOUR 

8049
04:16:10,021 --> 04:16:10,821
RESEARCH ON CAMBRIDGE 

8050
04:16:10,821 --> 04:16:12,223
ANALYTICA, I WOULD PERSONALLY 

8051
04:16:12,223 --> 04:16:13,024
APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D START 

8052
04:16:13,024 --> 04:16:15,026
BACK FROM THE FIRST KNOWN HIGH 

8053
04:16:15,026 --> 04:16:17,061
PROFILE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT 

8054
04:16:17,061 --> 04:16:17,929
EXPLOITED FACEBOOK DATA. 

8055
04:16:17,929 --> 04:16:19,831
IN FACT, THEY PUBLISHED AN APP 

8056
04:16:19,831 --> 04:16:21,833
THAT SAID IT WOULD GRAB 

8057
04:16:21,833 --> 04:16:23,801
INFORMATION ABOUT MY FRIENDS, 

8058
04:16:23,801 --> 04:16:25,503
THEIR BIRTH DATES, LOCATIONS 

8059
04:16:25,503 --> 04:16:25,936
AND LIKES. 

8060
04:16:25,936 --> 04:16:27,071
SO PRESUMABLY IF I DOWNLOADED 

8061
04:16:27,071 --> 04:16:29,307
THAT APP THAT WAS PUBLISHED BY 

8062
04:16:29,307 --> 04:16:32,343
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN, I'VE GOT 

8063
04:16:32,343 --> 04:16:34,511
4,900 FRIENDS ON MY FACEBOOK 

8064
04:16:34,511 --> 04:16:34,712
PAGE. 

8065
04:16:34,712 --> 04:16:36,214
I DELETE THE HATERS AND SAVE 

8066
04:16:36,214 --> 04:16:37,315
ROOM FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND 

8067
04:16:37,315 --> 04:16:38,916
TRUE FRIENDS ON MY PERSONAL 

8068
04:16:38,916 --> 04:16:40,183
PAGE, AS I'M SURE EVERYBODY 

8069
04:16:40,183 --> 04:16:41,519
DOES, THEN THAT MEANS IF I 

8070
04:16:41,519 --> 04:16:44,021
CLICK JUST ON THAT APP, I WOULD 

8071
04:16:44,021 --> 04:16:47,725
HAVE APPROVED THE ACCESS OF 

8072
04:16:47,725 --> 04:16:49,727
BIRTH DATES, LOCATIONS AND 

8073
04:16:49,727 --> 04:16:50,962
LIKES OF SOME 4,900 PEOPLE 

8074
04:16:50,962 --> 04:16:51,695
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. 

8075
04:16:51,695 --> 04:16:53,531
SO AS YOU DO THE CHRONOLOGY, I 

8076
04:16:53,531 --> 04:16:54,832
THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL 

8077
04:16:54,832 --> 04:16:57,034
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY THE 

8078
04:16:57,034 --> 04:16:57,668
PARTISAN RHETORIC THAT'S GOING 

8079
04:16:57,668 --> 04:17:00,171
ON LIKE THIS IS A REPUBLICAN 

8080
04:17:00,171 --> 04:17:00,504
ONLY ISSUE. 

8081
04:17:00,504 --> 04:17:01,772
IT'S A BROAD BASED ISSUE THAT 

8082
04:17:01,772 --> 04:17:03,908
NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND BAD 

8083
04:17:03,908 --> 04:17:05,909
ACTORS AT EITHER END OF THE 

8084
04:17:05,909 --> 04:17:06,944
POLITICAL SPECTRUM NEED TO BE 

8085
04:17:06,944 --> 04:17:07,611
HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND ILL TRUST 

8086
04:17:07,611 --> 04:17:10,114
YOU ALL ARE GOING TO WORK -- 

8087
04:17:10,114 --> 04:17:11,716
AND I TRUST YOU ALL ARE GOING 

8088
04:17:11,716 --> 04:17:13,518
TO WORK ON THAT. 

8089
04:17:14,452 --> 04:17:16,020
I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE 

8090
04:17:16,020 --> 04:17:16,253
FACTS. 

8091
04:17:16,253 --> 04:17:17,154
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN ANSWER 

8092
04:17:17,154 --> 04:17:18,622
ANY OF THE QUESTIONS. 

8093
04:17:18,622 --> 04:17:20,024
I'M NOT GOING TO BURDEN YOU 

8094
04:17:20,024 --> 04:17:22,226
WITH THAT, BUT I THINK GETTING 

8095
04:17:22,226 --> 04:17:23,527
THAT CHRONOLOGY WOULD BE VERY 

8096
04:17:23,527 --> 04:17:23,794
HELPFUL. 

8097
04:17:23,794 --> 04:17:25,162
THE ONE THING I WOULD ENCOURAGE 

8098
04:17:25,162 --> 04:17:28,098
PEOPLE TO DO IS GO TO FACEBOOK. 

8099
04:17:28,098 --> 04:17:29,599
I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF FACEBOOK. 

8100
04:17:29,599 --> 04:17:31,536
I JUST GOT A POST FROM MY 

8101

SISTER OF THIS BEING NATIONAL 

8102
04:17:32,904 --> 04:17:34,105
SIBLING DAY, SO I CONNECTED 

8103
04:17:34,105 --> 04:17:36,307
WITH FOUR OR FIVE OF MY FAMILY 

8104
04:17:36,307 --> 04:17:39,277
WHILE I WAS GIVING MY UNDIVIDED 

8105
04:17:39,277 --> 04:17:43,147
ATTENTION, BUT GO TO YOUR  

8106
04:17:43,147 --> 04:17:43,480
PRIVACY TAB. 

8107
04:17:43,480 --> 04:17:45,149
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE 

8108
04:17:45,149 --> 04:17:46,016
SOMETHING, DON'T SHARE IT. 

8109
04:17:46,016 --> 04:17:47,952
GO ON THERE AND SAY I DON'T 

8110
04:17:47,952 --> 04:17:49,253
WANT TO ALLOW THIRD PARTY 

8111
04:17:49,253 --> 04:17:51,321
ENGINES TO GET ON MY FACEBOOK 

8112
04:17:51,321 --> 04:17:51,522

8113
04:17:51,522 --> 04:17:52,823
GO IN THERE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT 

8114
04:17:52,823 --> 04:17:54,058
YOU'RE SIGNING UP FOR.

IT'S A FREE APP. 

8116
04:17:55,159 --> 04:17:56,326
NOW YOU NEED TO BE MORE AND I 

8117
04:17:56,326 --> 04:17:58,895
THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. 

8118
04:17:58,895 --> 04:17:59,563
I DIDN'T READ YOUR DISCLAIMER 

8119
04:17:59,563 --> 04:18:00,731
PAGE OR TERMS OF USE BECAUSE I 

8120
04:18:00,731 --> 04:18:03,434
DIDN'T SEE ANYWHERE IN THERE I 

8121
04:18:03,434 --> 04:18:04,769
COULD GET AN ATTORNEY AND 

8122
04:18:04,769 --> 04:18:05,769
NEGOTIATE THE TERMS. 

8123
04:18:05,769 --> 04:18:07,905
I WENT ON AND USED THE PRIVACY 

8124
04:18:07,905 --> 04:18:10,441
SETTINGS TO BE AS SAFE AS I 

8125
04:18:10,441 --> 04:18:12,743
COULD BE WITH A PRESENCE ON 

8126
04:18:12,743 --> 04:18:13,043
FACEBOOK. 

8127
04:18:13,043 --> 04:18:15,746
LAST THING, WE TALK ABOUT ALL 

8128
04:18:15,746 --> 04:18:16,547
THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION, GOOD 

8129
04:18:16,547 --> 04:18:18,049
IDEAS, BUT WHEN YOU WERE 

8130
04:18:18,049 --> 04:18:19,150
DEVELOPING THIS APP IN YOUR 

8131
04:18:19,150 --> 04:18:20,551
DORM, HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU 

8132
04:18:20,551 --> 04:18:23,721
HAVE IN YOUR REGULATORY AFFAIRS 

8133
04:18:23,721 --> 04:18:24,722
DIVISION UNTIL EXACTLY. 

8134
04:18:24,722 --> 04:18:26,357
SO IF GOVERNMENT TAKES A HEAVY 

8135
04:18:26,357 --> 04:18:27,658
HANDED APPROACH TO FIX THIS 

8136
04:18:27,658 --> 04:18:31,862
PROBLEM, THEN WE KNOW VERY WELL 

8137
04:18:31,862 --> 04:18:32,964
THAT THE NEXT FACEBOOK, THE 

8138
04:18:32,964 --> 04:18:34,065
NEXT THING YOU'LL WAKE UP AND 

8139
04:18:34,065 --> 04:18:35,666
WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU CONTINUE TO 

8140
04:18:35,666 --> 04:18:36,968
BE RELEVANT AS THE BEHEMOTH YOU 

8141
04:18:36,968 --> 04:18:38,636
ARE TODAY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING 

8142
04:18:38,636 --> 04:18:38,970
TO HAPPEN. 

8143
04:18:38,970 --> 04:18:40,504
SO I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A 

8144
04:18:40,504 --> 04:18:42,206
PLACE FOR SOME REGULATORY 

8145
04:18:42,206 --> 04:18:43,307
GUIDANCE HERE, BUT THERE'S A 

8146
04:18:43,307 --> 04:18:45,843
HUGE PLACE FOR GOOGLE, 

8147
04:18:45,843 --> 04:18:46,744
SNAPCHAT, TWITTER, ALL THE 

8148
04:18:46,744 --> 04:18:48,946
OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO 

8149
04:18:48,946 --> 04:18:51,248
GET TOGETHER AND CREATE 

8150
04:18:51,248 --> 04:18:52,550
STANDARDS AND I ALSO BELIEVE 

8151
04:18:52,550 --> 04:18:53,951
THAT THAT PERSON WHO MAY HAVE 

8152
04:18:53,951 --> 04:18:57,054
LOOKED THE OTHER WAY WHEN THE 

8153
04:18:57,054 --> 04:18:58,255
WHOLE SOCIAL GRAPH WAS 

8154
04:18:58,255 --> 04:18:59,457
EXTRACTED FOR THE OBAMA 

8155
04:18:59,457 --> 04:19:00,992
CAMPAIGN IF THEY'RE STILL 

8156
04:19:00,992 --> 04:19:02,125
WORKING FOR YOU, THEY PROBABLY 

8157
04:19:02,125 --> 04:19:03,060
SHOULDN'T OR AT LEAST THERE 

8158
04:19:03,060 --> 04:19:04,562
SHOULD BE A BUSINESS CODE OF 

8159
04:19:04,562 --> 04:19:06,664
CONDUCT THAT SAYS YOU DON'T 

8160
04:19:06,664 --> 04:19:07,064
PLAY FAVORITES. 

8161
04:19:07,064 --> 04:19:08,232
YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE A FAIR 

8162
04:19:08,232 --> 04:19:10,267
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE THEIR 

8163
04:19:10,267 --> 04:19:10,500
IDEAS. 

8164
04:19:10,500 --> 04:19:11,402
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 

8165
04:19:13,704 --> 04:19:15,205
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR TILLIS. 

8166
04:19:15,205 --> 04:19:15,572
SENATOR HARRIS. 

8167
04:19:15,572 --> 04:19:16,240
>> THANK YOU. 

8168
04:19:16,240 --> 04:19:17,842
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 

8169
04:19:17,842 --> 04:19:19,477
I'VE BEEN HERE ON AND OFF THE 

8170
04:19:19,477 --> 04:19:21,679
LAST FOUR HOURS THAT YOU'VE 

8171
04:19:21,679 --> 04:19:22,079
BEEN TESTIFYING. 

8172
04:19:22,079 --> 04:19:27,752
I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M 

8173
04:19:27,752 --> 04:19:28,753
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH 

8174
04:19:28,753 --> 04:19:32,289
FACEBOOK VALUES TRUST AND 

8175
04:19:32,289 --> 04:19:33,290
TRANSPARENCY. 

8176
04:19:33,290 --> 04:19:37,261
IF WE AGREE THAT A CRITICAL 

8177
04:19:37,261 --> 04:19:38,963
COMPONENT OF A RELATIONSHIP OF 

8178
04:19:38,963 --> 04:19:40,264
TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY IS WE 

8179
04:19:40,264 --> 04:19:42,266
SPEAK TRUTH AND WE GET TO THE 

8180
04:19:42,266 --> 04:19:42,533
TRUTH. 

8181
04:19:42,533 --> 04:19:43,868
DURING THE COURSE OF THIS 

8182
04:19:43,868 --> 04:19:45,336
HEARING THE LAST FOUR HOURS 

8183
04:19:45,336 --> 04:19:46,737
YOU'VE BEEN ASKED SEVERAL 

8184
04:19:46,737 --> 04:19:47,405
CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR WHICH 

8185
04:19:47,405 --> 04:19:51,642
YOU DON'T HAVE ANSWERS AND 

8186
04:19:51,642 --> 04:19:53,144
THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE INCLUDED 

8187
04:19:53,144 --> 04:19:54,745
WHETHER FACEBOOK CAN TRACK 

8188
04:19:54,745 --> 04:19:55,579
USERS' BROWSING ACTIVITY EVEN 

8189
04:19:55,579 --> 04:19:57,548
AFTER THE USER HAS LOGGED OFF 

8190
04:19:57,548 --> 04:19:58,649
OF FACEBOOK, WHETHER FACEBOOK 

8191
04:19:58,649 --> 04:19:59,950
CAN TRACK YOUR ACTIVITY ACROSS 

8192
04:19:59,950 --> 04:20:02,853
DEVICES EVEN WHEN YOU AREN'T 

8193
04:20:02,853 --> 04:20:07,758
LOGGED INTO FACEBOOK, WHO IS 

8194
04:20:07,758 --> 04:20:08,425
FACEBOOK'S BIGGEST COMPETITION, 

8195
04:20:08,425 --> 04:20:10,661
WHETHER FACEBOOK MAY STORE UP 

8196
04:20:10,661 --> 04:20:14,365
TO 96 CATEGORIES OF USERS' 

8197
04:20:14,365 --> 04:20:17,968
INFORMATION, WHETHER YOU KNEW 

8198
04:20:17,968 --> 04:20:19,370
WHETHER KOGAN'S TERMS OF 

8199
04:20:19,370 --> 04:20:21,005
SERVICE AND WHETHER YOU KNEW 

8200
04:20:21,005 --> 04:20:23,407
THAT KOGAN COULD SELL OR 

8201
04:20:23,407 --> 04:20:24,875
TRANSFER DATA AND THEN ANOTHER 

8202
04:20:24,875 --> 04:20:28,245
CASE IN POINT SPECIFICALLY AS 

8203
04:20:28,245 --> 04:20:29,480
IT RELATES TO CAMBRIDGE 

8204
04:20:29,480 --> 04:20:31,414
ANALYTICA IS AND A CONCERN OF 

8205
04:20:31,414 --> 04:20:33,484
MINE IS THAT YOU, MEANING 

8206
04:20:33,484 --> 04:20:34,752
FACEBOOK AND I'M GOING TO 

8207
04:20:34,752 --> 04:20:36,554
ASSUME YOU PERSONALLY AS CEO, 

8208
04:20:36,554 --> 04:20:40,491
BECAME AWARE IN DECEMBER OF 

8209
04:20:40,491 --> 04:20:42,660
2015 THAT DR. KOGAN AND 

8210
04:20:42,660 --> 04:20:44,361
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

8211
04:20:44,361 --> 04:20:45,496
MISAPPROPRIATED DATA FROM 87 

8212
04:20:45,496 --> 04:20:46,563
MILLION FACEBOOK USERS. 

8213
04:20:49,867 --> 04:20:52,069
THAT'S 27 MONTHS AGO THAT YOU 

8214
04:20:52,069 --> 04:20:53,170
BECAME AS FACEBOOK AND PERHAPS 

8215
04:20:53,170 --> 04:20:54,972
YOU PERSONALLY BECAME AWARE. 

8216
04:20:54,972 --> 04:20:56,974
HOWEVER, A DECISION WAS MADE 

8217
04:20:56,974 --> 04:21:00,777
NOT TO NOTIFY THE USERS. 

8218
04:21:00,777 --> 04:21:04,582
SO MY QUESTION IS DID ANYONE AT 

8219
04:21:04,582 --> 04:21:06,951
FACEBOOK HAVE A CONVERSATION AT 

8220
04:21:06,951 --> 04:21:10,755
THE TIME THAT YOU BECAME AWARE 

8221
04:21:10,755 --> 04:21:14,158
OF THIS BREACH AND HAVE A 

8222
04:21:14,158 --> 04:21:14,792
CONVERSATION WHEREIN THE 

8223
04:21:14,792 --> 04:21:16,593
DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO 

8224
04:21:16,593 --> 04:21:19,096
CONTACT THE USERS? 

8225
04:21:24,969 --> 04:21:26,537
>> SENATOR, I DON'T KNOW IF 

8226
04:21:26,537 --> 04:21:28,906
THERE WERE ANY CONVERSATIONS ON 

8227
04:21:28,906 --> 04:21:29,840
FACEBOOK AT ALL BECAUSE I WAS 

8228
04:21:29,840 --> 04:21:31,042
IN A LOT OF THEM. 

8229
04:21:31,042 --> 04:21:32,042
>> ON THAT SUBJECT. 

8230
04:21:32,042 --> 04:21:33,744
>> I'M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER 

8231
04:21:33,744 --> 04:21:34,177
PEOPLE DISCUSSED. 

8232
04:21:34,177 --> 04:21:37,081
AT THE TIME IN 2015 WE HEARD 

8233
04:21:37,081 --> 04:21:39,282
THE REPORT THAT THIS DEVELOPER, 

8234
04:21:39,282 --> 04:21:42,686
ALEKSANDR KOGAN, HAD SOLD DATA 

8235
04:21:42,686 --> 04:21:43,219
TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. 

8236
04:21:43,219 --> 04:21:44,688
THAT'S IN VIOLATION OF OUR 

8237
04:21:44,688 --> 04:21:45,156
TERMS. 

8238
04:21:45,156 --> 04:21:45,456
>> CORRECT. 

8239
04:21:45,456 --> 04:21:47,558
WERE YOU PART OF A DISCUSSION 

8240
04:21:47,558 --> 04:21:49,493
THAT RESULTED IN A DECISION NOT 

8241
04:21:49,493 --> 04:21:50,861
TO INFORM YOUR USERS? 

8242
04:21:52,163 --> 04:21:54,398
>> I DON'T REMEMBER A 

8243
04:21:54,398 --> 04:21:55,132
CONVERSATION LIKE THAT, BUT THE 

8244
04:21:55,132 --> 04:21:56,099
REASON WHY -- 

8245
04:21:56,099 --> 04:21:59,169
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF ANYONE IN 

8246
04:21:59,169 --> 04:22:00,638
LEADERSHIP AT FACEBOOK WHO WAS 

8247
04:22:00,638 --> 04:22:02,673
IN A CONVERSATION WHERE A 

8248
04:22:02,673 --> 04:22:04,074
DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO INFORM 

8249
04:22:04,074 --> 04:22:06,443
YOUR USERS OR DO YOU BELIEVE NO 

8250
04:22:06,443 --> 04:22:07,077
SUCH CONVERSATION EVER TOOK 

8251
04:22:07,077 --> 04:22:07,678
PLACE? 

8252
04:22:08,479 --> 04:22:09,680
>> I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THERE 

8253
04:22:09,680 --> 04:22:10,681
WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT, 

8254
04:22:10,681 --> 04:22:12,483
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE THOUGHT 

8255
04:22:12,483 --> 04:22:13,651
PROCESS AT THE TIME OF THE 

8256
04:22:13,651 --> 04:22:16,086
COMPANY, WHICH WAS THAT IN 2015 

8257
04:22:16,086 --> 04:22:18,789
WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT THIS, WE 

8258
04:22:18,789 --> 04:22:21,659
BANNED THE DEVELOPER AND WE 

8259
04:22:21,659 --> 04:22:22,493
DEMANDED THAT THEY DELETE ALL 

8260
04:22:22,493 --> 04:22:24,395
THE DATA AND STOP USING IT AND 

8261
04:22:24,395 --> 04:22:26,062
THE SAME WITH CAMBRIDGE 

8262
04:22:26,062 --> 04:22:26,363
ANALYTICA. 

8263
04:22:26,363 --> 04:22:27,097
>> I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY 

8264
04:22:27,097 --> 04:22:28,399
IN THAT REGARD, BUT I'M TALKING 

8265
04:22:28,399 --> 04:22:31,001
ABOUT NOTIFICATION OF THE USERS 

8266
04:22:31,001 --> 04:22:34,638
AND THIS RELATES TO THE ISSUE 

8267
04:22:34,638 --> 04:22:35,973
OF TRANSPARENCY AND THE 

8268
04:22:35,973 --> 04:22:36,874
RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST, 

8269
04:22:36,874 --> 04:22:38,409
INFORMING THE USER ABOUT WHAT 

8270
04:22:38,409 --> 04:22:41,879
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF HOW THEIR 

8271
04:22:41,879 --> 04:22:43,113
PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN 

8272
04:22:43,113 --> 04:22:48,551
MISUSED AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED 

8273
04:22:48,551 --> 04:22:49,787
THAT WHEN YOU PERSONALLY BECAME 

8274
04:22:49,787 --> 04:22:51,422
AWARE OF THIS, DID YOU OR 

8275
04:22:51,422 --> 04:22:54,024
SENIOR LEADERSHIP DO AN INQUIRY 

8276
04:22:54,024 --> 04:22:57,494
TO  FIND OUT WHO AT FACEBOOK 

8277
04:22:57,494 --> 04:22:58,495
HAD THIS INFORMATION AND DID 

8278
04:22:58,495 --> 04:23:00,064
THEY NOT HAVE A DISCUSSION 

8279
04:23:00,064 --> 04:23:02,299
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE USERS 

8280
04:23:02,299 --> 04:23:04,034
SHOULD BE INFORMED BACK IN 

8281
04:23:04,034 --> 04:23:06,203
DECEMBER OF 2015? 

8282
04:23:08,671 --> 04:23:10,407
>> SENATOR, IN RETROSPECT I 

8283
04:23:10,407 --> 04:23:12,109
THINK WE CLEARLY VIEW IT AS A 

8284
04:23:12,109 --> 04:23:13,410
MISTAKE THAT WE DIDN'T INFORM 

8285
04:23:13,410 --> 04:23:15,512
PEOPLE AND WE DID THAT BASED ON 

8286
04:23:15,512 --> 04:23:16,413
FALSE INFORMATION THAT WE 

8287
04:23:16,413 --> 04:23:17,580
THOUGHT THAT THE CASE WAS 

8288
04:23:17,580 --> 04:23:20,351
CLOSED AND THAT THE DATA HAD 

8289
04:23:20,351 --> 04:23:20,684
BEEN DELETED. 

8290
04:23:20,684 --> 04:23:22,319
>> SO THERE WAS A DECISION MADE 

8291
04:23:22,319 --> 04:23:24,521
ON THAT BASIS NOT TO INFORM THE 

8292
04:23:24,521 --> 04:23:25,089
USERS. 

8293
04:23:25,089 --> 04:23:25,489
IS THAT CORRECT? 

8294
04:23:25,489 --> 04:23:26,924
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING, 

8295
04:23:26,924 --> 04:23:28,192
YES, BUT IN RETROSPECT I THINK 

8296
04:23:28,192 --> 04:23:31,128
THAT WAS A MISTAKE AND KNOWING 

8297
04:23:31,128 --> 04:23:33,798
WHAT WE KNOW NOW WE SHOULD HAVE 

8298
04:23:33,798 --> 04:23:34,999
HANDLED A LOT OF THINGS 

8299
04:23:34,999 --> 04:23:35,332
DIFFERENTLY. 

8300
04:23:35,332 --> 04:23:36,433
>> I APPRECIATE THAT POINT. 

8301
04:23:36,433 --> 04:23:37,601
DO YOU KNOW WHEN THAT DECISION 

8302
04:23:37,601 --> 04:23:39,536
WAS MADE NOT TO INFORM THE 

8303
04:23:39,536 --> 04:23:40,671
USERS? 

8304
04:23:40,671 --> 04:23:41,672
>> I DON'T. 

8305
04:23:41,672 --> 04:23:41,938

8306
04:23:41,938 --> 04:23:42,873
LAST NOVEMBER THE SENATE 

8307
04:23:42,873 --> 04:23:44,508
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HELD A 

8308
04:23:44,508 --> 04:23:45,909
HEARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

8309
04:23:45,909 --> 04:23:46,209
INFLUENCE. 

8310
04:23:46,209 --> 04:23:48,979
I WAS A PART OF THAT HEARING. 

8311
04:23:48,979 --> 04:23:50,314
I SUBMITTED 50 WRITTEN 

8312
04:23:50,314 --> 04:23:52,182
QUESTIONS TO FACEBOOK AND OTHER 

8313
04:23:52,182 --> 04:23:53,817
COMPANIES AND THE RESPONSES 

8314
04:23:53,817 --> 04:23:55,252
THAT WE RECEIVED WERE 

8315
04:23:55,252 --> 04:23:57,421
UNFORTUNATELY EVASIVE AND SOME 

8316
04:23:57,421 --> 04:23:58,989
WERE, FRANKLY, NONRESPONSIVE. 

8317
04:23:58,989 --> 04:23:59,590
SO I'M GOING TO ASK THE 

8318
04:23:59,590 --> 04:24:00,424
QUESTION AGAIN HERE. 

8319
04:24:02,126 --> 04:24:03,227
HOW MUCH REVENUE DID FACEBOOK 

8320
04:24:03,227 --> 04:24:05,629
EARN FROM THE USER ENGAGEMENT 

8321
04:24:05,629 --> 04:24:06,663
THAT RESULTED FROM FOREIGN 

8322
04:24:06,663 --> 04:24:07,264
PROPAGANDA? 

8323
04:24:08,331 --> 04:24:10,000
>> WELL, SENATOR, WHAT WE DO 

8324
04:24:10,000 --> 04:24:13,170
KNOW IS THAT THE IRA, THE 

8325
04:24:13,170 --> 04:24:15,272
INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY, THE 

8326
04:24:15,272 --> 04:24:16,807
RUSSIAN FIRM, RAN ABOUT 

8327
04:24:16,807 --> 04:24:19,109
$100,000 WORTH OF ADS. 

8328
04:24:19,109 --> 04:24:20,311
I CAN'T SAY THAT WE'VE 

8329
04:24:20,311 --> 04:24:21,612
IDENTIFIED ALL OF THE FOREIGN 

8330
04:24:21,612 --> 04:24:24,314
ACTORS WHO ARE INVOLVED HERE. 

8331
04:24:24,314 --> 04:24:25,816
SO I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT'S ALL 

8332
04:24:25,816 --> 04:24:27,518
OF THE MONEY, BUT THAT IS WHAT 

8333
04:24:27,518 --> 04:24:28,886
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. 

8334
04:24:28,886 --> 04:24:29,153
>> OKAY. 

8335
04:24:29,153 --> 04:24:30,754
MY TIME IS UP. 

8336
04:24:30,754 --> 04:24:31,956
I'LL SUBMIT MORE QUESTIONS FOR 

8337
04:24:31,956 --> 04:24:32,656
THE RECORD. 

8338
04:24:32,656 --> 04:24:33,023
THANK YOU. 

8339
04:24:33,023 --> 04:24:35,759

8341
04:24:42,433 --> 04:24:48,271

GOD, I WILL. 

8347
04:24:59,215 --> 04:25:00,818
A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS ON YOU. 

8348
04:25:01,719 --> 04:25:03,754
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN 

8349
04:25:03,754 --> 04:25:04,654
THIS HEARING TODAY. 

8350
04:25:04,654 --> 04:25:07,057
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT 

8351
04:25:07,057 --> 04:25:08,525
WE'RE CONNECTING. 

8352
04:25:09,426 --> 04:25:11,328
SO LET ME TRY TO LAY IT OUT FOR 

8353
04:25:11,328 --> 04:25:13,030
YOU FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. 

8354
04:25:14,565 --> 04:25:16,767
I THINK YOU ARE A REALLY SMART 

8355
04:25:16,767 --> 04:25:21,805

8356
04:25:21,805 --> 04:25:22,740

BEEN ABLE TO DO ARE MAGICAL, 

8361

PROBLEM AND THERE ARE TWO. 

8380
04:26:15,592 --> 04:26:16,994
ONE IS A PRIVACY PROBLEM.

THE OTHER ONE IS WHAT I CALL A 

8382

YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

THE PURPOSE OF THAT USER 

8396
04:26:46,757 --> 04:26:47,958
AGREEMENT IS TO COVER 

8397
04:26:47,958 --> 04:26:48,725
FACEBOOK'S REAR END. 

8398
04:26:48,725 --> 04:26:50,060

8486
04:29:22,679 --> 04:29:24,046
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. 

8487
04:29:24,046 --> 04:29:26,250
>> OKAY. 

8488
04:29:27,484 --> 04:29:29,052
I WANT TO BE SURE -- I'M ABOUT 

8489
04:29:29,052 --> 04:29:30,187
OUT OF TIME. 

8490
04:29:30,187 --> 04:29:31,754
IT GOES FAST, DOESN'T IT? 

8491
04:29:31,754 --> 04:29:34,091
LET ME ASK YOU ONE FINAL 

8492
04:29:34,091 --> 04:29:37,026
QUESTION IN MY 12 SECONDS. 

8493
04:29:37,026 --> 04:29:40,397
CAN SOMEBODY CALL YOU UP AND 

8494
04:29:40,397 --> 04:29:43,367
SAY I WANT TO SEE JOHN 

8495
04:29:43,367 --> 04:29:43,800
KENNEDY'S FILE? 

8496
04:29:43,800 --> 04:29:46,269
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

8497
04:29:46,269 --> 04:29:48,438
>> COULD YOU -- NOT WOULD YOU 

8498
04:29:48,438 --> 04:29:49,105
DO IT. 

8499
04:29:49,105 --> 04:29:50,774
COULD YOU DO IT? 

8500
04:29:52,743 --> 04:29:53,277
>> IN THEORY. 

8501
04:29:53,277 --> 04:29:55,579
>> DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT 

8502
04:29:55,579 --> 04:29:57,681
MY DATA, A NAME ON MY DATA, AND 

8503
04:29:57,681 --> 04:29:58,748
SHARE IT WITH SOMEBODY? 

8504
04:29:58,748 --> 04:30:00,083
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE THE 

8505
04:30:00,083 --> 04:30:00,984
RIGHT TO DO THAT. 

8506
04:30:00,984 --> 04:30:02,853
>> DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY? 

8507
04:30:04,288 --> 04:30:06,055
>> SENATOR, THE DATA IS IN THE 

8508
04:30:06,055 --> 04:30:06,556
SYSTEM. 

8509
04:30:06,556 --> 04:30:07,557
EVERY, SO -- 

8510
04:30:07,557 --> 04:30:09,359
>> DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY -- 

8511
04:30:09,359 --> 04:30:10,460
SYSTEM, SO -- 

8512
04:30:10,460 --> 04:30:11,861
>> DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY? 

8513
04:30:11,861 --> 04:30:12,796
>> TECHNICALLY WE HAVE THE 

8514
04:30:12,796 --> 04:30:14,998
ABLE, BUT IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE 

8515
04:30:14,998 --> 04:30:16,233
BREACH, SO WE WOULD NEVER DO 

8516
04:30:16,233 --> 04:30:16,433
THAT. 

8517
04:30:16,433 --> 04:30:18,635
>> IT WOULD BE A BREACH. 

8518
04:30:18,635 --> 04:30:19,569
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

8519
04:30:19,569 --> 04:30:22,104
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR KENNEDY. 

8520
04:30:22,104 --> 04:30:23,740
SENATOR BALDWIN IS UP NEXT. 

8521
04:30:23,740 --> 04:30:25,475
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

8522
04:30:25,475 --> 04:30:28,178
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND 

8523
04:30:28,178 --> 04:30:29,546
ENDURING A LONG DAY, MR. 

8524
04:30:29,546 --> 04:30:30,981
ZUCKERBERG. 

8525
04:30:32,115 --> 04:30:34,084
I WANT TO START WITH WHAT I 

8526
04:30:34,084 --> 04:30:36,386
HOPE CAN BE A QUICK ROUND OF 

8527
04:30:36,386 --> 04:30:39,122
QUESTIONS JUST SO I MAKE SURE I 

8528
04:30:39,122 --> 04:30:39,655
UNDERSTAND YOUR PREVIOUS 

8529
04:30:39,655 --> 04:30:41,625
TESTIMONY. 

8530
04:30:45,028 --> 04:30:49,833
SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE 

8531
04:30:49,833 --> 04:30:56,038
PROCESS BY WHICH CAMBRIDGE 

8532
04:30:56,038 --> 04:30:58,875
ANALYTICA WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE 

8533
04:30:58,875 --> 04:30:59,609
FACEBOOK USERS' DATA.  

8534
04:30:59,609 --> 04:31:03,046
IT WAS AN APPEAR DEVELOPER 

8535
04:31:03,046 --> 04:31:05,582
ALEKSANDR KOGAN WHO COLLECTED 

8536
04:31:05,582 --> 04:31:07,250
FACEBOOK DATA THROUGH A 

8537
04:31:07,250 --> 04:31:07,650
PERSONALITY QUIZ. 

8538
04:31:07,650 --> 04:31:08,451
IS THAT CONVECT? 

8539
04:31:08,451 --> 04:31:09,419
>> YES. 

8540
04:31:09,419 --> 04:31:11,854
>> HE THEREBY -- CORRECT? 

8541
04:31:11,854 --> 04:31:12,289
>> YES. 

8542
04:31:12,289 --> 04:31:14,691
>> HE THEREBY IS ABLE TO GAIN 

8543
04:31:14,691 --> 04:31:15,892
ACCESS TO DATA NOT ONLY BY 

8544
04:31:15,892 --> 04:31:18,395
PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE QUIZ BUT TO 

8545
04:31:18,395 --> 04:31:18,762
THEIR NETWORK. 

8546
04:31:18,762 --> 04:31:19,696
IS THAT CORRECT, TOO? 

8547
04:31:19,696 --> 04:31:20,697
>> SENATOR, YES. 

8548
04:31:20,697 --> 04:31:22,199
THE TERMS OF THE PLATFORM AT 

8549
04:31:22,199 --> 04:31:24,101
THE TIME ALLOWED FOR PEOPLE TO 

8550
04:31:24,101 --> 04:31:25,802
SHARE THEIR INFORMATION AND 

8551
04:31:25,802 --> 04:31:26,770
SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT 

8552
04:31:26,770 --> 04:31:28,271
THEIR FRIENDS AS WELL. 

8553
04:31:28,271 --> 04:31:30,173
WE'VE SINCE CHANGED THAT AS OF 

8554
04:31:30,173 --> 04:31:30,507
2014. 

8555
04:31:30,507 --> 04:31:31,974
NOW THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. 

8556
04:31:31,974 --> 04:31:37,080
>> SO IN TOTAL ABOUT 87 MILLION 

8557
04:31:37,080 --> 04:31:37,614
FACEBOOK USERS. 

8558
04:31:37,614 --> 04:31:38,915
YOU EARLIER TESTIFIED ABOUT THE 

8559
04:31:38,915 --> 04:31:40,984
TWO TYPES OF WAYS YOU GAINED 

8560
04:31:40,984 --> 04:31:41,284
DATA. 

8561
04:31:41,284 --> 04:31:43,387
ONE IS WHAT IS VOLUNTARILY 

8562
04:31:43,387 --> 04:31:45,322
SHARED BY FACEBOOK MEMBERS AND 

8563
04:31:45,322 --> 04:31:48,792
USERS AND THE OTHER IS IN ORDER 

8564
04:31:48,792 --> 04:31:52,396
TO I THINK YOU SAID IMPROVE 

8565
04:31:52,396 --> 04:31:53,196
YOUR ADVERTISING EXPERIENCE, 

8566
04:31:53,196 --> 04:31:55,431
WHATEVER THAT EXACTLY MEANS, 

8567
04:31:55,431 --> 04:31:57,901
THE DATA FACEBOOK COLLECTS IN 

8568
04:31:57,901 --> 04:32:02,072
ORDER TO CUSTOMIZE OR FOCUS ON 

8569
04:32:02,072 --> 04:32:02,372
THAT. 

8570
04:32:02,372 --> 04:32:03,573
WAS ALEKSANDR KOGAN ABLE TO GET 

8571
04:32:03,573 --> 04:32:06,309
BOTH OF THOSE SETS OF DATA OR 

8572
04:32:06,309 --> 04:32:07,844
JUST WHAT WAS VOLUNTARILY 

8573
04:32:07,844 --> 04:32:09,012
ENTERED BY THE USER? 

8574
04:32:10,313 --> 04:32:10,546
>> YES. 

8575
04:32:10,546 --> 04:32:11,381
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 

8576
04:32:11,381 --> 04:32:13,116
IT WAS JUST A SUBSET OF WHAT 

8577
04:32:13,116 --> 04:32:15,785
WAS ENTERED BY THE PERSON AND 

8578
04:32:15,785 --> 04:32:16,019
-- 

8579
04:32:16,019 --> 04:32:20,023
>> SO A SUBSET OF THE 95 

8580
04:32:20,023 --> 04:32:22,826
CATEGORIES OF DATA THAT YOU 

8581
04:32:22,826 --> 04:32:23,026
KEEP? 

8582
04:32:23,026 --> 04:32:23,259
>> YES. 

8583
04:32:23,259 --> 04:32:25,629
WHEN YOU SIGN INTO AN APP, THE 

8584
04:32:25,629 --> 04:32:26,797
APP DEVELOPER HAS TO SAY HERE 

8585
04:32:26,797 --> 04:32:30,434
ARE THE TYPES OF DATA THAT FROM 

8586
04:32:30,434 --> 04:32:32,335
YOU I'M ASKING FOR INCLUDING 

8587
04:32:32,335 --> 04:32:34,471
PUBLIC INFORMATION LIKE YOUR 

8588
04:32:34,471 --> 04:32:36,506
NAME AND PROFILE, THE PAGES YOU 

8589
04:32:36,506 --> 04:32:37,707
FOLLOW, OTHER INTERESTS ON YOUR 

8590
04:32:37,707 --> 04:32:39,809
PROFILE, THAT KIND OF CONTENT. 

8591
04:32:39,809 --> 04:32:40,076
>> OKAY. 

8592
04:32:40,076 --> 04:32:46,216
>> THE APP  DEVELOPER HAS TO 

8593
04:32:46,216 --> 04:32:48,151
DISCLOSE THAT UP FRONT AND YOU 

8594
04:32:48,151 --> 04:32:49,920
AGREE TO THAT. 

8595
04:32:49,920 --> 04:32:51,221
>> SPECIFICALLY TO SENATOR 

8596
04:32:51,221 --> 04:32:52,222
FISHER YOU TALKED ABOUT 

8597
04:32:52,222 --> 04:32:53,824
FACEBOOK STORING THIS DATA AND 

8598
04:32:53,824 --> 04:32:55,425
I THINK YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT 

8599
04:32:55,425 --> 04:32:56,926
THE DATA BEING IN THE SYSTEM. 

8600
04:32:58,561 --> 04:33:00,897
I WONDER IF OUTSIDE OF THE WAY 

8601
04:33:00,897 --> 04:33:05,035
IN WHICH ALEKSANDR KOGAN WAS 

8602
04:33:05,035 --> 04:33:07,871
ABLE TO ACCESS THIS DATA, COULD 

8603
04:33:07,871 --> 04:33:11,241
FACEBOOK BE VULNERABLE TO A 

8604
04:33:11,241 --> 04:33:12,008
DATA BREACH OR HACK? 

8605
04:33:12,008 --> 04:33:12,909
WHY OR WHY NOT? 

8606
04:33:13,710 --> 04:33:15,312
>> WELL, THERE ARE MANY KINDS 

8607
04:33:15,312 --> 04:33:18,448
OF SECURITY THREATS THAT A 

8608
04:33:18,448 --> 04:33:19,815
COMPANY LIKE OURS FACES 

8609
04:33:19,815 --> 04:33:21,017
INCLUDING PEOPLE TRYING TO 

8610
04:33:21,017 --> 04:33:23,520
BREAK INTO OUR SECURITY 

8611
04:33:23,520 --> 04:33:23,787
SYSTEMS. 

8612
04:33:23,787 --> 04:33:24,053
>> OKAY. 

8613
04:33:24,053 --> 04:33:25,622
AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAD 

8614
04:33:25,622 --> 04:33:27,123
BEEN HACKED, DO YOU BELIEVE YOU 

8615
04:33:27,123 --> 04:33:29,158
WOULD HAVE THE DUTY TO INFORM 

8616
04:33:29,158 --> 04:33:31,628
THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED? 

8617
04:33:34,530 --> 04:33:34,897
>> YES. 

8618
04:33:37,234 --> 04:33:40,636
>> DO YOU KNOW WHETHER 

8619
04:33:40,636 --> 04:33:41,904
ALEKSANDR KOGAN SOLD ANY OF THE 

8620
04:33:41,904 --> 04:33:45,741
DATA HE COLLECTED WITH ANYONE 

8621
04:33:45,741 --> 04:33:46,909
OTHER THAN CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA? 

8622
04:33:46,909 --> 04:33:48,777
>> SENATOR, YES, WE DO. 

8623
04:33:48,777 --> 04:33:53,216
HE SOLD IT TO A COUPLE OF OTHER 

8624
04:33:53,216 --> 04:33:53,449
FIRMS. 

8625
04:33:53,449 --> 04:33:55,819
>> CAN YOU IDENTIFY THEM? 

8626
04:33:55,819 --> 04:33:56,720
>> YES. 

8627
04:33:56,720 --> 04:34:00,657
THERE'S ONE CALLED UNNOYA AND 

8628
04:34:00,657 --> 04:34:02,058
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF 

8629
04:34:02,058 --> 04:34:03,827
OTHER AS WELL. 

8630
04:34:03,827 --> 04:34:05,929
>> CAN YOU FURNISH THAT TO ME? 

8631
04:34:05,929 --> 04:34:06,162
>> YES. 

8632
04:34:06,162 --> 04:34:07,529
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 

8633
04:34:07,529 --> 04:34:07,830
THANK YOU. 

8634
04:34:07,830 --> 04:34:09,132
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW OR HAVE 

8635
04:34:09,132 --> 04:34:11,634
YOU TRIED TO FIND OUT HOW 

8636
04:34:11,634 --> 04:34:12,635
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA USED THE 

8637
04:34:12,635 --> 04:34:16,907
DATA WHILE THEY HAD IT BEFORE 

8638
04:34:16,907 --> 04:34:19,810
YOU BELIEVE THEY DELETED IT? 

8639
04:34:21,044 --> 04:34:23,546
>> SINCE WE JUST HEARD THAT 

8640
04:34:23,546 --> 04:34:24,614
THEY DIDN'T DELETE IT ABOUT A 

8641
04:34:24,614 --> 04:34:26,416
MONTH AGO, WE'VE KICKED OFF AN 

8642
04:34:26,416 --> 04:34:27,217
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TO SEE 

8643
04:34:27,217 --> 04:34:29,919
IF THEY USED THAT DATA IN ANY 

8644
04:34:29,919 --> 04:34:31,287
OF THEIR ADS, FOR EXAMPLE. 

8645
04:34:31,287 --> 04:34:34,658
THAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL 

8646
04:34:34,658 --> 04:34:37,293
UNDERWAY AND WE WILL -- WE CAN 

8647
04:34:37,293 --> 04:34:38,728
COME BACK TO THE RESULTS OF 

8648
04:34:38,728 --> 04:34:40,430
THAT ONCE WE HAVE THAT. 

8649
04:34:40,430 --> 04:34:40,697
>> OKAY. 

8650
04:34:40,697 --> 04:34:42,265
I WANT TO SWITCH TO MY 

8651
04:34:42,265 --> 04:34:43,533
HOMESTATE OF WISCONSIN. 

8652
04:34:43,533 --> 04:34:45,235
ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, MY 

8653
04:34:45,235 --> 04:34:47,504
HOMESTATE OF WISCONSIN WAS A 

8654
04:34:47,504 --> 04:34:48,872
MAJOR TARGET OF RUSSIAN BOUGHT 

8655
04:34:48,872 --> 04:34:51,541
ADS ON FACEBOOK IN THE 2016 

8656
04:34:51,541 --> 04:34:51,808
ELECTION. 

8657
04:34:51,808 --> 04:34:52,975
THESE DIVISIVE ADS TOUCHING ON 

8658
04:34:52,975 --> 04:34:55,544
A NUMBER OF VERY POLARIZING 

8659
04:34:55,544 --> 04:34:58,148
ISSUES WERE DESIGNED TO 

8660
04:34:58,148 --> 04:35:00,081
INTERFERE WITH OUR ELECTION. 

8661
04:35:00,081 --> 04:35:02,252
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT RUSSIAN 

8662
04:35:02,252 --> 04:35:06,523
ACTORS USING ANOTHER PLATFORM, 

8663
04:35:06,523 --> 04:35:09,058
TWITTER, SIMILARLY TARGETED 

8664
04:35:09,058 --> 04:35:12,228
WISCONSIN WITH DIVISIVE CONTENT 

8665
04:35:12,228 --> 04:35:13,630
AIMED AT SOWING DIVISION AND 

8666
04:35:13,630 --> 04:35:17,434
DISSENT INCLUDING IN THE WAKE 

8667
04:35:17,434 --> 04:35:19,035
OF A POLICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING 

8668
04:35:19,035 --> 04:35:20,303
IN MILWAUKEE'S SHERMAN PARK 

8669
04:35:20,303 --> 04:35:22,005
NEIGHBORHOOD IN AUGUST OF 2016. 

8670
04:35:22,005 --> 04:35:23,405
NOW I FIND SOME ENCOURAGEMENT 

8671
04:35:23,405 --> 04:35:26,042
IN THE STEPS YOU'VE OUTLINED 

8672
04:35:26,042 --> 04:35:28,979
TODAY TO PROVIDE GREATER 

8673
04:35:28,979 --> 04:35:29,479
TRANSPARENCY REGARDING 

8674
04:35:29,479 --> 04:35:29,813
POLITICAL ADS. 

8675
04:35:30,546 --> 04:35:32,649
I DO WANT TO GET FURTHER 

8676
04:35:32,649 --> 04:35:36,419
INFORMATION ON HOW YOU CAN BE 

8677
04:35:36,419 --> 04:35:39,022
CONFIDENT THAT YOU HAVE 

8678
04:35:39,022 --> 04:35:39,756
EXCLUDED ENTITIES BASED OUTSIDE 

8679
04:35:39,756 --> 04:35:41,224
OF THE UNITED STATES. 

8680
04:35:44,226 --> 04:35:45,527
>> I'LL FOLLOW UP ON THAT. 

8681
04:35:45,527 --> 04:35:52,035
>> AND I THINK ON THAT TOPIC IF 

8682
04:35:52,035 --> 04:35:55,404
YOU REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF A 

8683
04:35:55,404 --> 04:35:58,842
POLITICAL AD'S SPONSOR, WHAT 

8684
04:35:58,842 --> 04:36:01,276
SORT OF TRANSPARENCY WILL YOU 

8685
04:36:01,276 --> 04:36:03,045
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WITH REGARD 

8686
04:36:03,045 --> 04:36:07,417
TO PEOPLE  WHO WEREN'T THE 

8687
04:36:07,417 --> 04:36:09,853
SUBJECT OF THAT AD SEEING ITS 

8688
04:36:09,853 --> 04:36:10,118
CONTENT? 

8689
04:36:10,118 --> 04:36:11,054
>> SENATOR, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO 

8690
04:36:11,054 --> 04:36:12,856
GO TO ANY PAGE AND SEE ALL OF 

8691
04:36:12,856 --> 04:36:16,826
THE ADS THAT THAT PAGE HAS RUN. 

8692
04:36:16,826 --> 04:36:18,527
SO IF SOMEONE IS RUNNING A 

8693
04:36:18,527 --> 04:36:19,362
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, FOR 

8694
04:36:19,362 --> 04:36:20,762
EXAMPLE, AND THEY'RE TARGETING 

8695
04:36:20,762 --> 04:36:21,965
ONE DISTRICT WITH ONE AD AND 

8696
04:36:21,965 --> 04:36:23,733
ANOTHER DISTRICT WITH ANOTHER, 

8697
04:36:23,733 --> 04:36:25,235
HISTORICALLY IT'S BEEN HARD TO 

8698
04:36:25,235 --> 04:36:26,202
TRACK THAT DOWN, BUT NOW IT 

8699
04:36:26,202 --> 04:36:27,402
WILL BE VERY EASY. 

8700
04:36:27,402 --> 04:36:29,139
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ALL 

8701
04:36:29,139 --> 04:36:31,440
THE ADS THREE RUN, THE 

8702
04:36:31,440 --> 04:36:33,143
TARGETING ASSOCIATED WITH -- 

8703
04:36:33,143 --> 04:36:34,677
THEY'VE RUN, THE TARGETING 

8704
04:36:34,677 --> 04:36:36,179
ASSOCIATED WITH EACH TO SEE 

8705
04:36:36,179 --> 04:36:36,746
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TO 

8706
04:36:36,746 --> 04:36:38,148
DIFFERENT FOLKS AND IN SOME 

8707
04:36:38,148 --> 04:36:39,249
CASES HOW MUCH THEY'RE SPENDING 

8708
04:36:39,249 --> 04:36:41,217
ON THE ADS AND ALL OF THE 

8709
04:36:41,217 --> 04:36:41,717
RELEVANT INFORMATION. 

8710
04:36:41,717 --> 04:36:43,652
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I THINK 

8711
04:36:43,652 --> 04:36:45,255
MORE TRANSPARENCY WILL REALLY 

8712
04:36:45,255 --> 04:36:46,922
HELP DISCOURSE OVERALL AND ROOT 

8713
04:36:46,922 --> 04:36:48,658
OUT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN 

8714
04:36:48,658 --> 04:36:48,957
ELECTIONS. 

8715
04:36:48,957 --> 04:36:50,893
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR BALDWIN. 

8716
04:36:50,893 --> 04:36:51,427
SENATOR JOHNSON. 

8717
04:36:51,427 --> 04:36:53,996
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

8718
04:36:53,996 --> 04:36:54,864
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG, FOR 

8719
04:36:54,864 --> 04:36:55,998
TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. 

8720
04:36:55,998 --> 04:36:57,567
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY 

8721
04:36:57,567 --> 04:36:59,536
OF YOUR USERS ACTUALLY READ THE 

8722
04:36:59,536 --> 04:37:01,037
TERMS OF SERVICE, THE PRIVACY 

8723
04:37:01,037 --> 04:37:02,905
POLICY, THE STATEMENT OF RIGHTS 

8724
04:37:02,905 --> 04:37:04,540
AND RESPONSIBILITIES, I MEAN 

8725
04:37:04,540 --> 04:37:05,508
ACTUALLY READ IT? 

8726
04:37:05,508 --> 04:37:07,043
>> SENATOR, I DO NOT. 

8727
04:37:07,043 --> 04:37:08,878
>> WOULD YOU IMAGINE IT'S A 

8728
04:37:08,878 --> 04:37:10,847
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE? 

8729
04:37:10,847 --> 04:37:12,749
>> SENATOR, WHO READ THE WHOLE 

8730
04:37:12,749 --> 04:37:13,149
THING? 

8731
04:37:13,149 --> 04:37:14,150
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT PROBABLY 

8732
04:37:14,150 --> 04:37:15,952
MOST PEOPLE DO NOT READ THE 

8733
04:37:15,952 --> 04:37:17,453
WHOLE THING, BUT EVERYONE HAS 

8734
04:37:17,453 --> 04:37:18,955
THE OPPORTUNITY TO AND CONSENTS 

8735
04:37:18,955 --> 04:37:19,522
TO IT. 

8736
04:37:19,522 --> 04:37:20,956
>> I AGREE, BUT THAT'S KIND OF 

8737
04:37:20,956 --> 04:37:22,058
TRUE OF EVERY APPLICATION WHERE 

8738
04:37:22,058 --> 04:37:23,960
YOU WANT TO GET TO IT AND YOU 

8739
04:37:23,960 --> 04:37:25,562
HAVE TO AGREE TO IT AND PEOPLE 

8740
04:37:25,562 --> 04:37:27,396
JUST PRESS THAT AGREE. 

8741
04:37:27,396 --> 04:37:28,932
THE VAST MAJORITY, CORRECT? 

8742
04:37:28,932 --> 04:37:29,766
>> SENATOR, IT'S REALLY HARD 

8743
04:37:29,766 --> 04:37:32,134
FOR ME TO MAKE A FULL 

8744
04:37:32,134 --> 04:37:33,302
ASSESSMENT, BUT -- 

8745
04:37:33,302 --> 04:37:34,738
>> COMMON SENSE WILL TELL YOU 

8746
04:37:34,738 --> 04:37:36,639
THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE 

8747
04:37:36,639 --> 04:37:36,839
CASE. 

8748
04:37:36,839 --> 04:37:37,640
WITH ALL THIS PUBLICITY HAVE 

8749
04:37:37,640 --> 04:37:39,475
YOU DOCUMENTED ANY KIND OF 

8750
04:37:39,475 --> 04:37:41,177
BACKLASH FROM FACEBOOK USERS? 

8751
04:37:41,177 --> 04:37:42,912
HAS THERE BEEN A DRAMATIC 

8752
04:37:42,912 --> 04:37:44,747
FALLOFF IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 

8753
04:37:44,747 --> 04:37:46,848
WHO UTILIZE FACEBOOK BECAUSE OF 

8754
04:37:46,848 --> 04:37:47,283
THESE CONCERNS? 

8755
04:37:47,283 --> 04:37:50,787
>> SENATOR, THERE HAS NOT. 

8756
04:37:50,787 --> 04:37:52,955
>> YOU HAVEN'T WITNESSED ANY? 

8757
04:37:52,955 --> 04:37:54,157
>> SENATOR, THERE WAS A 

8758
04:37:54,157 --> 04:37:57,427
MOVEMENT WHERE SOME PEOPLE WERE 

8759
04:37:57,427 --> 04:37:59,362
ENCOURAGING THEIR FRIENDS TO 

8760
04:37:59,362 --> 04:38:00,163
DELETE THEIR ACCOUNT AND I 

8761
04:38:00,163 --> 04:38:01,965
THINK THAT THAT GOT SHARED A 

8762
04:38:01,965 --> 04:38:02,198
BUNCH. 

8763
04:38:02,198 --> 04:38:03,967
>> SO IT'S KIND OF SAFE TO SAY 

8764
04:38:03,967 --> 04:38:05,168
THAT FACEBOOK USERS DON'T SEEM 

8765
04:38:05,168 --> 04:38:08,738
TO BE OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT 

8766
04:38:08,738 --> 04:38:10,039
ALL THESE REVELATIONS, ALTHOUGH 

8767
04:38:10,039 --> 04:38:10,672
OBVIOUSLY CONGRESS APPARENTLY 

8768
04:38:10,672 --> 04:38:12,474
IS. 

8769
04:38:15,778 --> 04:38:16,679
>> WELL, SENATOR, I THINK 

8770
04:38:16,679 --> 04:38:17,947
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. 

8771
04:38:17,947 --> 04:38:19,783
I THINK THESE ARE INCREDIBLY 

8772
04:38:19,783 --> 04:38:20,883
IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT PEOPLE 

8773
04:38:20,883 --> 04:38:22,585
WANT US TO ADDRESS AND I THINK 

8774
04:38:22,585 --> 04:38:24,187
PEOPLE HAVE TOLD US THAT VERY 

8775
04:38:24,187 --> 04:38:24,454
CLEARLY. 

8776
04:38:24,454 --> 04:38:25,687
>> IT SEEMS LIKE FACEBOOK USERS 

8777
04:38:25,687 --> 04:38:27,257
STILL WANT TO USE THE PLATFORM 

8778
04:38:27,257 --> 04:38:29,292
BECAUSE THEY ENJOY SHARING 

8779
04:38:29,292 --> 04:38:30,193
PHOTOS AND THEY SHARE THE 

8780
04:38:30,193 --> 04:38:31,861
CONNECTIVITY WITH THE FAMILY 

8781
04:38:31,861 --> 04:38:33,396
MEMBERS, THAT TYPE OF THING AND 

8782
04:38:33,396 --> 04:38:35,598
THAT OVERRIDES THEIR CONCERNS 

8783
04:38:35,598 --> 04:38:35,965
ABOUT PRIVACY. 

8784
04:38:35,965 --> 04:38:37,901
YOU TALK ABOUT THE USER OWNS 

8785
04:38:37,901 --> 04:38:38,268
THE DATA. 

8786
04:38:38,268 --> 04:38:40,636
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 

8787
04:38:40,636 --> 04:38:41,669
PROPOSALS THAT HAD THAT DATA 

8788
04:38:41,669 --> 04:38:43,438
STAY WITH THE USER AND ALLOW 

8789
04:38:43,438 --> 04:38:46,975
THE USER TO MONETIZE IT 

8790
04:38:46,975 --> 04:38:47,377
THEMSELVES. 

8791
04:38:47,377 --> 04:38:48,812
YOUR COO MISS SANDBERG 

8792
04:38:48,812 --> 04:38:50,279
MENTIONED POSSIBLY IF YOU CAN'T 

8793
04:38:50,279 --> 04:38:53,081
UTILIZE THAT DATA TOO SELL 

8794
04:38:53,081 --> 04:38:54,583
ADVERTISING, PERHAPS WE'D -- TO 

8795
04:38:54,583 --> 04:38:55,384
SELL ADVERTISING, PERHAPS WE'D 

8796
04:38:55,384 --> 04:38:57,220
CHARGE PEOPLE TO GO ONTO 

8797
04:38:57,220 --> 04:38:57,487
FACEBOOK. 

8798
04:38:57,487 --> 04:38:58,087
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 

8799
04:38:58,087 --> 04:39:00,490
MODEL WHERE THE USER DATA IS 

8800
04:39:00,490 --> 04:39:01,290
ACTUALLY MONETIZED BY THE 

8801
04:39:01,290 --> 04:39:02,192
ACTUAL USER? 

8802
04:39:05,695 --> 04:39:07,197
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT SURE 

8803
04:39:07,197 --> 04:39:08,296
EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD WORK FOR 

8804
04:39:08,296 --> 04:39:14,737
IT TO BE MONETIZED BY THE 

8805
04:39:14,737 --> 04:39:16,137
PERSON DIRECTLY. 

8806
04:39:16,137 --> 04:39:17,339
IN GENERAL WE BELIEVE THE ADS 

8807
04:39:17,339 --> 04:39:19,975
MODEL IS THE RIGHT 1 FOR US 

8808
04:39:19,975 --> 04:39:21,711
BECAUSE IT ALIGNS -- RIGHT ONE 

8809
04:39:21,711 --> 04:39:23,011
FOR US BECAUSE IT ALIGNS WITH 

8810
04:39:23,011 --> 04:39:24,614
OUR SOCIAL MISSION TRYING TO 

8811
04:39:24,614 --> 04:39:25,447
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. 

8812
04:39:25,447 --> 04:39:27,951
>> BUT YOU'RE AWARE OF THE 

8813
04:39:27,951 --> 04:39:28,484
PROPOSAL, CORRECT? 

8814
04:39:28,484 --> 04:39:29,785
>> SENATOR, YES. 

8815
04:39:29,785 --> 04:39:31,187
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUGGEST WE 

8816
04:39:31,187 --> 04:39:32,187
SHOULD OFFER A VERSION WHERE 

8817
04:39:32,187 --> 04:39:35,825
PEOPLE CANNOT HAVE ADS IF THEY 

8818
04:39:35,825 --> 04:39:37,026
PAY A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. 

8819
04:39:37,026 --> 04:39:38,294
CERTAINLY WE CONSIDER IDEAS 

8820
04:39:38,294 --> 04:39:38,594
LIKE THAT. 

8821
04:39:38,594 --> 04:39:39,728
I THINK THEY'RE REASONABLE 

8822
04:39:39,728 --> 04:39:41,163
IDEAS TO THINK THROUGH, BUT 

8823
04:39:41,163 --> 04:39:44,601
OVERALL I THINK THAT THE ADS 

8824
04:39:44,601 --> 04:39:46,269
EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE THE 

8825
04:39:46,269 --> 04:39:46,569
BEST ONE. 

8826
04:39:46,569 --> 04:39:47,871
I THINK IN GENERAL PEOPLE LIKE 

8827
04:39:47,871 --> 04:39:49,372
NOT HAVING TO TAKE FOR A 

8828
04:39:49,372 --> 04:39:49,639
SERVICE. 

8829
04:39:49,639 --> 04:39:50,974
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO 

8830
04:39:50,974 --> 04:39:52,208
PAY FOR A SERVICE AROUND THE 

8831
04:39:52,208 --> 04:39:55,011
WORLD AND IN ALIGNS WITH OUR 

8832
04:39:55,011 --> 04:39:55,411
MISSION THE BEST. 

8833
04:39:55,411 --> 04:39:56,312
>> YOU ANSWERED SENATOR GRAHAM 

8834
04:39:56,312 --> 04:39:58,715
WHEN HE ASKED YOU IF YOU 

8835
04:39:58,715 --> 04:39:59,782
THOUGHT YOU WERE A MONOPOLY, 

8836
04:39:59,782 --> 04:40:00,516
YOU DIDN'T THINK. 

8837
04:40:00,516 --> 04:40:01,050
SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A BIG 

8838
04:40:01,050 --> 04:40:02,218
PLAYER IN THE SPACE. 

8839
04:40:02,218 --> 04:40:04,187
THAT MIGHT BE AN AREA FOR 

8840
04:40:04,187 --> 04:40:04,821
COMPETITION, CORRECT, IF 

8841
04:40:04,821 --> 04:40:06,789
SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS TO CREATE A 

8842
04:40:06,789 --> 04:40:08,391
SOCIAL PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS AIL 

8843
04:40:08,391 --> 04:40:10,193
USER TO MONETIZE THEIR -- A 

8844
04:40:10,193 --> 04:40:12,629
USER TO MONETIZE THEIR OWN 

8845
04:40:12,629 --> 04:40:13,096
DATA. 

8846
04:40:13,096 --> 04:40:13,496
>> SENATOR, YES. 

8847
04:40:13,496 --> 04:40:14,797
THERE ARE LOTS OF NEW SOCIAL 

8848
04:40:14,797 --> 04:40:16,499
APPS ALL THE TIME AND AS I SAID 

8849
04:40:16,499 --> 04:40:18,701
BEFORE, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN I 

8850
04:40:18,701 --> 04:40:19,502
THINK USES EIGHT DIFFERENT 

8851
04:40:19,502 --> 04:40:20,770
COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL APPS. 

8852
04:40:20,770 --> 04:40:22,171
SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT 

8853
04:40:22,171 --> 04:40:22,972
CHOICE AND INNOVATION AND 

8854
04:40:22,972 --> 04:40:24,707
ACTIVITY GOING ON IN THIS 

8855
04:40:24,707 --> 04:40:24,941
SPACE. 

8856
04:40:24,941 --> 04:40:26,609
>> I WANT TO IN A VERY SHORT 

8857
04:40:26,609 --> 04:40:27,710
PERIOD OF TIME HERE TALK ABOUT 

8858
04:40:27,710 --> 04:40:29,412
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

8859
04:40:29,412 --> 04:40:30,012
ADVERTISERS AND APPLICATION 

8860
04:40:30,012 --> 04:40:30,980
DEVELOPERS BECAUSE AGAIN YOU 

8861
04:40:30,980 --> 04:40:32,215
SAID IN EARLIER TESTIMONY THE 

8862
04:40:32,215 --> 04:40:37,653
ADVERTISERS HAVE NO ACCESS TO 

8863
04:40:37,653 --> 04:40:38,621
DATA WHATSOEVER, BUT 

8864
04:40:38,621 --> 04:40:39,455
APPLICATION DEVELOPERS DO. 

8865
04:40:39,455 --> 04:40:40,856
NOW IS THAT ONLY THROUGH THEIR 

8866
04:40:40,856 --> 04:40:44,193
OWN IS OF AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR 

8867
04:40:44,193 --> 04:40:45,728
CUSTOMERS OR DO -- OWN SERVICE 

8868
04:40:45,728 --> 04:40:46,896
AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS 

8869
04:40:46,896 --> 04:40:48,798
OR DO THEY ACTUALLY ACCESS DATA 

8870
04:40:48,798 --> 04:40:51,233
THROUGH THEIR OWN APPLICATIONS? 

8871
04:40:51,233 --> 04:40:53,203
>> SENATOR, WE GIVE PEOPLE THE 

8872
04:40:53,203 --> 04:40:54,370
ABILITY TO TAKE THEIR DATA TO 

8873
04:40:54,370 --> 04:40:55,671
ANOTHER APP IF THEY WANT. 

8874
04:40:55,671 --> 04:40:57,574
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT SENATOR 

8875
04:40:57,574 --> 04:40:59,609
KENNEDY ASKED ME JUST A FEW 

8876
04:40:59,609 --> 04:40:59,942
MINUTES AGO. 

8877
04:40:59,942 --> 04:41:01,310
THE REASON WHY WE DESIGNED THE 

8878
04:41:01,310 --> 04:41:02,712
PLATFORM THAT WAY IS BECAUSE WE 

8879
04:41:02,712 --> 04:41:04,414
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL 

8880
04:41:04,414 --> 04:41:06,215
TO MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE COULD 

8881
04:41:06,215 --> 04:41:08,585
EASILY BRING THEIR DATA TO 

8882
04:41:08,585 --> 04:41:08,952
OTHER SERVICES. 

8883
04:41:08,952 --> 04:41:10,252
SOME PEOPLE INSIDE THE COMPANY 

8884
04:41:10,252 --> 04:41:11,821
ARGUED AGAINST THAT AT THE TIME 

8885
04:41:11,821 --> 04:41:13,990
BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT 

8886
04:41:13,990 --> 04:41:15,090
-- THEY SAID HEY, WE SHOULD 

8887
04:41:15,090 --> 04:41:16,693
úMA 

8888
04:41:16,693 --> 04:41:18,127
ONES WHO DEVELOP THIS STUFF. 

8889
04:41:18,127 --> 04:41:19,629
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A USEFUL 

8890
04:41:19,629 --> 04:41:20,529
THING FOR PEOPLE. 

8891
04:41:20,529 --> 04:41:22,398
>> THAT'S THE USER AGREEING TO 

8892
04:41:22,398 --> 04:41:23,499
ALLOW YOU TO SHARE, WHEN 

8893
04:41:23,499 --> 04:41:25,601
THEY'RE USING THAT A.M., TO 

8894
04:41:25,601 --> 04:41:27,503
ALLOW FACEBOOK TO SHARE -- APP 

8895
04:41:27,503 --> 04:41:28,671
TO ALLOW FACEBOOK TO SHARE 

8896
04:41:28,671 --> 04:41:29,272
DATA.  

8897
04:41:29,272 --> 04:41:30,573
DO THE DEVELOPERS EVER HAVE 

8898
04:41:30,573 --> 04:41:32,642
ACCESS TO THAT DATA PRIOR TO 

8899
04:41:32,642 --> 04:41:34,042
USERS USING IT? 

8900
04:41:34,042 --> 04:41:35,411
USING THE TERM SCRAPED DATA, 

8901
04:41:35,411 --> 04:41:36,712
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

8902
04:41:36,712 --> 04:41:38,247
WHO SCRAPED THE DATA. 

8903
04:41:38,247 --> 04:41:38,881
>> YES, SENATOR. 

8904
04:41:38,881 --> 04:41:40,917
THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION. 

8905
04:41:40,917 --> 04:41:45,021
THERE'S THE DEFORM  -- 

8906
04:41:45,021 --> 04:41:50,026
DEVELOPER PLATFORM WHICH IS THE 

8907
04:41:50,026 --> 04:41:51,794
SANCTIONED WAY TO ASK THAT 

8908
04:41:51,794 --> 04:41:52,128
QUESTION. 

8909
04:41:52,128 --> 04:41:53,229
A LOT OF THE INFORMATION PEOPLE 

8910
04:41:53,229 --> 04:41:54,530
CHOOSE TO PUT ON FACEBOOK ARE 

8911
04:41:54,530 --> 04:41:57,800
SHARING WITH EVERYONE ON THE 

8912
04:41:57,800 --> 04:41:58,333
WORLD, NOT PRIVATELY. 

8913
04:41:58,333 --> 04:41:59,902
YOU PUT YOUR NAME AND PROFILE 

8914
04:41:59,902 --> 04:42:00,536
PICTURE, THAT'S PUBLIC 

8915
04:42:00,536 --> 04:42:01,370
INFORMATION PEOPLE PUT OUT 

8916
04:42:01,370 --> 04:42:03,706
THERE AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO 

8917
04:42:03,706 --> 04:42:05,141
AREN'T REGISTERED DEVELOPERS OF 

8918
04:42:05,141 --> 04:42:07,110
FACEBOOK TRY TO LOAD A LOT OF 

8919
04:42:07,110 --> 04:42:09,445
PAGES TO GET ACCESS TO A BUNCH 

8920
04:42:09,445 --> 04:42:10,546
OF PEOPLE'S PUBLIC INFORMATION 

8921
04:42:10,546 --> 04:42:11,281
AND AGGREGATE IT. 

8922
04:42:11,281 --> 04:42:12,648
WE FIGHT BACK HARD AGAINST THAT 

8923
04:42:12,648 --> 04:42:14,317
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO 

8924
04:42:14,317 --> 04:42:15,251
AGGREGATE INFORMATION EVEN IF 

8925
04:42:15,251 --> 04:42:16,319
PEOPLE MADE IT PUBLIC AND CHOSE 

8926
04:42:16,319 --> 04:42:18,086
TO SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE. 

8927
04:42:18,086 --> 04:42:19,888
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

8928
04:42:19,888 --> 04:42:22,791
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR JOHNSON. 

8929
04:42:22,791 --> 04:42:23,860
SENATOR HANSON. 

8930
04:42:23,860 --> 04:42:25,994
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

8931
04:42:25,994 --> 04:42:26,763
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG, FOR 

8932
04:42:26,763 --> 04:42:27,663
BEING HERE TODAY. 

8933
04:42:27,663 --> 04:42:31,134
I WANT TO TALK TO A COUPLE OF 

8934
04:42:31,134 --> 04:42:31,667
BROADER ISSUES. 

8935
04:42:31,667 --> 04:42:36,005
I'M CONCERNED THAT FACEBOOK'S 

8936
04:42:36,005 --> 04:42:37,807
PROFITABILITY RESTS ON TWO 

8937
04:42:37,807 --> 04:42:38,674
POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC 

8938
04:42:38,674 --> 04:42:39,375
FOUNDATIONS AND WE'VE HEARD 

8939
04:42:39,375 --> 04:42:41,277
OTHER SENATORS TALK ABOUT THIS 

8940
04:42:41,277 --> 04:42:42,578
A LITTLE TODAY. 

8941
04:42:42,578 --> 04:42:44,747
THE FOUNDATIONS ARE MAXIMIZING 

8942
04:42:44,747 --> 04:42:46,048
THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPEND 

8943
04:42:46,048 --> 04:42:47,749
ON YOUR PRODUCT AND CHECKING 

8944
04:42:47,749 --> 04:42:48,484
PEOPLE'S DATA. 

8945
04:42:50,453 --> 04:42:51,354
I'VE LOOKED AT FACEBOOK'S 2017 

8946
04:42:51,354 --> 04:42:52,054
CORPORATE FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

8947
04:42:52,054 --> 04:42:54,690
WHERE YOU LAY OUT SOME OF THE 

8948
04:42:54,690 --> 04:42:56,124
MAJOR RISKS TO YOUR BUSINESS. 

8949
04:42:56,124 --> 04:42:58,361
ONE RISK IS A DECREASE IN -- 

8950
04:42:58,361 --> 04:43:00,863
AND I QUOTE -- USER ENGAGEMENT 

8951
04:43:00,863 --> 04:43:03,266
INCLUDING TIME SPENT ON OUR 

8952
04:43:03,266 --> 04:43:03,533
PRODUCTS. 

8953
04:43:03,533 --> 04:43:05,335
THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE OF THE 

8954
04:43:05,335 --> 04:43:06,669
RESEARCH WE'VE SEEN SUGGESTING 

8955
04:43:06,669 --> 04:43:09,338
THAT TOO MUCH TIME SPENT ON 

8956
04:43:09,338 --> 04:43:11,140
SOCIAL MEDIA CAN HURT PEOPLE'S 

8957
04:43:11,140 --> 04:43:12,842
MENTAL HEALTH, ESPECIALLY YOUNG 

8958
04:43:12,842 --> 04:43:13,075
PEOPLE. 

8959
04:43:13,075 --> 04:43:14,177
ANOTHER MAJOR RISK TO YOUR 

8960
04:43:14,177 --> 04:43:15,278
BUSINESS IS THE POTENTIAL 

8961
04:43:15,278 --> 04:43:16,445
DECLINE IN -- AND HERE'S 

8962
04:43:16,445 --> 04:43:17,946
ANOTHER QUOTE -- THE 

8963
04:43:17,946 --> 04:43:18,881
EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR AD 

8964
04:43:18,881 --> 04:43:20,349
TARGETING OR THE DEGREE TO 

8965
04:43:20,349 --> 04:43:22,418
WHICH USERS OPT OUT OF CERTAIN 

8966
04:43:22,418 --> 04:43:23,853
TYPES OF AD TARGETING INCLUDING 

8967
04:43:23,853 --> 04:43:26,789
AS A RESULT OF CHANGES THAT 

8968
04:43:26,789 --> 04:43:30,225
ENHANCE THE USER'S PRIVACY. 

8969
04:43:30,225 --> 04:43:31,094
THERE'S CLEARLY TENSION,AS 

8970
04:43:31,094 --> 04:43:32,462
OTHER SENATORS HAVE POINTED 

8971
04:43:32,462 --> 04:43:34,163
OUT, BETWEEN YOUR BOTTOM LINE 

8972
04:43:34,163 --> 04:43:35,798
AND WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR USERS. 

8973
04:43:35,798 --> 04:43:38,568
YOU'VE SAID IN YOUR TESTIMONY 

8974
04:43:38,568 --> 04:43:39,769
THAT FACEBOOK'S MISSION IS TO 

8975
04:43:39,769 --> 04:43:41,137
BRING THE WORLD CLOSER TOGETHER 

8976
04:43:41,137 --> 04:43:43,639
AND YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU WILL 

8977
04:43:43,639 --> 04:43:44,740
NEVER PRIORITIZE ADVERTISERS 

8978
04:43:44,740 --> 04:43:47,110
OVER THAT MISSION AND I BELIEVE 

8979
04:43:47,110 --> 04:43:48,277
THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT. 

8980
04:43:49,778 --> 04:43:52,281
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOUR 

8981
04:43:52,281 --> 04:43:54,584
BUSINESS MODEL DOES PRIORITIZE 

8982
04:43:54,584 --> 04:43:56,451
ADVERTISERS OVER THE MISSION. 

8983
04:43:56,451 --> 04:43:58,020
FACEBOOK IS A FOR PROFIT 

8984
04:43:58,020 --> 04:44:01,090
COMPANY AND AS A CEO YOU HAVE A 

8985
04:44:01,090 --> 04:44:03,559
LEGAL DUTY TO DO WHAT'S BEST 

8986
04:44:03,559 --> 04:44:04,059
FOR YOUR SHAREHOLDERS. 

8987
04:44:04,059 --> 04:44:06,095
SO GIVEN ALL OF THAT WHY SHOULD 

8988
04:44:06,095 --> 04:44:08,097
WE THINK THAT FACEBOOK ON ITS 

8989
04:44:08,097 --> 04:44:11,200
OWN WILL EVER TRULY BE ABLE TO 

8990
04:44:11,200 --> 04:44:12,301
MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED 

8991
04:44:12,301 --> 04:44:14,737
IT TO MAKE TO PROTECT 

8992
04:44:14,737 --> 04:44:16,139
AMERICANS' WELL-BEING AND 

8993
04:44:16,139 --> 04:44:16,406
PRIVACY? 

8994
04:44:16,406 --> 04:44:18,074
>> WELL, SENATOR, YOU RAISE A 

8995
04:44:18,074 --> 04:44:20,076
NUMBER OF IMPORTANT POINTS IN 

8996
04:44:20,076 --> 04:44:20,309
THERE. 

8997
04:44:20,309 --> 04:44:21,611
LET ME RESPOND IN A COUPLE 

8998
04:44:21,611 --> 04:44:23,312
DIFFERENT WAYS. 

8999
04:44:23,312 --> 04:44:23,579
>> SURE. 

9000
04:44:23,579 --> 04:44:24,313
>> THE FIRST IS THAT I THINK 

9001
04:44:24,313 --> 04:44:25,181
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK 

9002
04:44:25,181 --> 04:44:26,382
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS 

9003
04:44:26,382 --> 04:44:27,583
BUILDING THIS COMMUNITY OVER 

9004
04:44:27,583 --> 04:44:28,084
THE LONG TERM. 

9005
04:44:28,084 --> 04:44:28,885
ANY BUSINESS HAS THE 

9006
04:44:28,885 --> 04:44:31,187
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS THAT 

9007
04:44:31,187 --> 04:44:32,288
MIGHT INCREASE REVENUE IN THE 

9008
04:44:32,288 --> 04:44:33,723
SHORT TERM, BUT AT THE EXPENSE 

9009
04:44:33,723 --> 04:44:36,192
OF TRUST OR BUILDING ENGAGEMENT 

9010
04:44:36,192 --> 04:44:36,692
OVER TIME. 

9011
04:44:36,692 --> 04:44:38,728
WHAT WE ACTUALLY FIND IS NOT 

9012
04:44:38,728 --> 04:44:39,896
NECESSARILY THAT INCREASING 

9013
04:44:39,896 --> 04:44:41,297
TIME SPENT, ESPECIALLY NOT JUST 

9014
04:44:41,297 --> 04:44:42,431
IN THE SHORT TERM, IS GOING TO 

9015
04:44:42,431 --> 04:44:45,167
BE BEST FOR OUR BUSINESS. 

9016
04:44:45,167 --> 04:44:47,103
IT ACTUALLY ALIGNS VERY CLOSELY 

9017
04:44:47,103 --> 04:44:48,271
WITH THE WELL-BEING RESEARCH 

9018
04:44:48,271 --> 04:44:49,772
THAT WE'VE DONE, THAT WHEN 

9019
04:44:49,772 --> 04:44:50,473
PEOPLE ARE INTERACTING  WITH 

9020
04:44:50,473 --> 04:44:54,410
OTHER PEOPLE AND POSTING AND 

9021
04:44:54,410 --> 04:44:55,211
BASICALLY BUILDING 

9022
04:44:55,211 --> 04:44:57,413
RELATIONSHIPS, THAT IS BOTH 

9023
04:44:57,413 --> 04:44:59,948
CORRELATED WITH HIGHER MEASURES 

9024
04:44:59,948 --> 04:45:02,351
OF WELL-BEING, HEALTH, 

9025
04:45:02,351 --> 04:45:04,820
HAPPINESS, NOT FEELING LONELY 

9026
04:45:04,820 --> 04:45:06,722
AND THAT ENDS UP BEING BETTER 

9027
04:45:06,722 --> 04:45:08,024
FOR THE BUSINESS THAN WHEN 

9028
04:45:08,024 --> 04:45:08,925
THEY'RE DOING LOWER VALUE 

9029
04:45:08,925 --> 04:45:11,259
THINGS LIKE JUST PASSIVELY 

9030
04:45:11,259 --> 04:45:12,160
CONSUMING CONTENT. 

9031
04:45:12,160 --> 04:45:13,829
I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 

9032
04:45:13,829 --> 04:45:14,063
POINT. 

9033
04:45:14,063 --> 04:45:14,797
>> I UNDERSTAND THE POINT 

9034
04:45:14,797 --> 04:45:16,199
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE HERE, BUT 

9035
04:45:16,199 --> 04:45:20,102
HERE'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED 

9036
04:45:20,102 --> 04:45:20,403
ABOUT. 

9037
04:45:20,403 --> 04:45:21,470
WE HAVE HEARD THIS POINT FROM 

9038
04:45:21,470 --> 04:45:25,908
YOU OVER THE LAST DECADE PLUS 

9039
04:45:25,908 --> 04:45:28,511
SINCE YOU FOUNDED FACEBOOK AND 

9040
04:45:28,511 --> 04:45:29,512
I UNDERSTAND YOU FOUNDED IT 

9041
04:45:29,512 --> 04:45:30,913
PRETTY MUCH AS A SOLO 

9042
04:45:30,913 --> 04:45:32,114
ENTREPRENEUR WITH YOUR 

9043
04:45:32,114 --> 04:45:33,949
ROOMMATE, BUT NOW YOU'RE 

9044
04:45:33,949 --> 04:45:36,919
SITTING HERE THE HEAD OF A 

9045
04:45:36,919 --> 04:45:37,820
BAZILLION DOLLAR COMPANY AND 

9046
04:45:37,820 --> 04:45:39,522
WE'VE HEARD YOU APOLOGIZE 

9047
04:45:39,522 --> 04:45:40,990
NUMEROUS TIMES AND PROMISE TO 

9048
04:45:40,990 --> 04:45:48,231
CHANGE, BUT HERE WE ARE AGAIN, 

9049
04:45:48,231 --> 04:45:48,698
RIGHT? 

9050
04:45:48,698 --> 04:45:50,132
SO I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN FREE 

9051
04:45:50,132 --> 04:45:51,601
ENTERPRISE, BUT WHEN PRIVATE 

9052
04:45:51,601 --> 04:45:52,802
COMPANIES ARE UNWILLING OR 

9053
04:45:52,802 --> 04:45:54,370
UNABLE TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY, 

9054
04:45:54,370 --> 04:45:56,272
PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE 

9055
04:45:56,272 --> 04:45:57,907
HISTORICALLY IN EVERY INDUSTRY 

9056
04:45:57,907 --> 04:45:59,608
STEPPED UP TO PROTECT OUR 

9057
04:45:59,608 --> 04:46:01,310
CONSTITUENTS AND CONSUMERS. 

9058
04:46:01,310 --> 04:46:01,911
YOU SUPPORTED TARGETED 

9059
04:46:01,911 --> 04:46:04,013
REGULATION SUCH AS THE HONEST 

9060
04:46:04,013 --> 04:46:06,649
ADS ACT AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 

9061
04:46:06,649 --> 04:46:07,649
STEP FOR ELECTION INTEGRITY. 

9062
04:46:07,649 --> 04:46:09,619
I'M PROUD TO BE A COSPONSOR OF 

9063
04:46:09,619 --> 04:46:11,020
THAT BILL, BUT WE NEED TO 

9064
04:46:11,020 --> 04:46:13,122
ADDRESS OTHER BROADER ISSUES AS 

9065
04:46:13,122 --> 04:46:13,823
WELL. 

9066
04:46:13,823 --> 04:46:15,625
TODAY YOU SAID YOU'D BE OPEN TO 

9067
04:46:15,625 --> 04:46:16,826
SOME REGULATION, BUT THIS HAS 

9068
04:46:16,826 --> 04:46:18,027
BEEN A PRETTY GENERAL 

9069
04:46:18,027 --> 04:46:18,360
CONVERSATION. 

9070
04:46:18,360 --> 04:46:20,129
SO WILL YOU COMMIT TO WORKING 

9071
04:46:20,129 --> 04:46:23,499
WITH CONGRESS TO DEVELOP WAYS 

9072
04:46:23,499 --> 04:46:25,034
OF PROTECTING CONSTITUENT 

9073
04:46:25,034 --> 04:46:26,402
PRIVACY AND WELL-BEING EVEN IF 

9074
04:46:26,402 --> 04:46:27,970
IT MEANS THAT THAT RESULTS IN 

9075
04:46:27,970 --> 04:46:29,805
SOME LAWS THAT WILL REQUIRE YOU 

9076
04:46:29,805 --> 04:46:30,973
TO ADJUST YOUR BUSINESS MODEL? 

9077
04:46:33,342 --> 04:46:33,742
>> SENATOR, YES. 

9078
04:46:33,742 --> 04:46:34,510
WE WILL COMMIT TO THAT. 

9079
04:46:34,510 --> 04:46:35,811
I THINK THAT THAT'S AN 

9080
04:46:35,811 --> 04:46:38,114
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE. 

9081
04:46:38,114 --> 04:46:39,949
OUR POSITION IS NOT THAT 

9082
04:46:39,949 --> 04:46:40,716
REGULATION IS BAD. 

9083
04:46:40,716 --> 04:46:43,819
I THINK THE INTERNET IS SO 

9084
04:46:43,819 --> 04:46:44,620
IMPORTANT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND 

9085
04:46:44,620 --> 04:46:46,422
IT'S GETTING MORE IMPORTANT. 

9086
04:46:46,422 --> 04:46:47,623
THE EXPECTATIONS ON INTERNET 

9087
04:46:47,623 --> 04:46:48,891
AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES 

9088
04:46:48,891 --> 04:46:50,126
OVERALL ARE GROWING AND I THINK 

9089
04:46:50,126 --> 04:46:51,394
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT IS 

9090
04:46:51,394 --> 04:46:53,629
THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK FOR THIS, 

9091
04:46:53,629 --> 04:46:54,864
NOT SHOULD THERE BE ONE. 

9092
04:46:54,864 --> 04:46:56,465
>> THAT IS VERY HELPFUL. 

9093
04:46:56,465 --> 04:46:57,833
AND I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION 

9094
04:46:57,833 --> 04:46:59,135
AND IT DOESN'T JUST GO TO 

9095
04:46:59,135 --> 04:47:01,304
FACEBOOK IS WHETHER THE 

9096
04:47:01,304 --> 04:47:02,505
FRAMEWORK SHOULD INCLUDE 

9097
04:47:02,505 --> 04:47:06,008
FINANCIAL PENALTIES WHEN LARGE 

9098
04:47:06,008 --> 04:47:07,810
PROVIDERS LIKE FACEBOOK ARE 

9099
04:47:07,810 --> 04:47:08,878
BREACHED AND PRIVACY IS 

9100
04:47:08,878 --> 04:47:10,345
COMPROMISED AS A RESULT BECAUSE 

9101
04:47:10,345 --> 04:47:13,015
RIGHT NOW THERE IS VERY LITTLE 

9102
04:47:13,015 --> 04:47:15,217
INCENTIVE FOR WHETHER IT'S 

9103
04:47:15,217 --> 04:47:17,886
FACEBOOK OR EQUIFAX TO ACTUALLY 

9104
04:47:17,886 --> 04:47:19,421
BE AGGRESSIVE IN PROTECTING 

9105
04:47:19,421 --> 04:47:21,824
CUSTOMER PRIVACY AND LOOKING 

9106
04:47:21,824 --> 04:47:23,025
FOR POTENTIAL BREACHES OR 

9107
04:47:23,025 --> 04:47:23,826
VULNERABILITIES IN THEIR 

9108
04:47:23,826 --> 04:47:24,059
SYSTEM. 

9109
04:47:24,059 --> 04:47:26,429
SO WHAT WE HEAR AFTER THE FACT, 

9110
04:47:26,429 --> 04:47:28,731
AFTER PEOPLE'S PRIVACY HAS BEEN 

9111
04:47:28,731 --> 04:47:29,598
BREACHED, AFTER THEY'VE TAKEN 

9112
04:47:29,598 --> 04:47:32,935
THE HARM THAT COMES WITH THAT 

9113
04:47:32,935 --> 04:47:33,735
AND CONSIDERABLE INCONVENIENCE 

9114
04:47:33,735 --> 04:47:35,905
IN ADDITION TO THE HARM, WE'VE 

9115
04:47:35,905 --> 04:47:37,473
HEARD APOLOGIES, BUT THERE IS 

9116
04:47:37,473 --> 04:47:39,308
NO FINANCIAL INCENTIVE RIGHT 

9117
04:47:39,308 --> 04:47:44,513
NOW IT SEEMS TO ME FOR THESE 

9118
04:47:44,513 --> 04:47:46,382
COMPANIES TO AGGRESSIVELY STAND 

9119
04:47:46,382 --> 04:47:48,951
IN THEIR CONSUMERS' STEAD AND 

9120
04:47:48,951 --> 04:47:50,820
PROTECT THEIR PRIEF AND I WOULD 

9121
04:47:50,820 --> 04:47:51,854
REALLY LOOK FORWARD -- PRIVACY 

9122
04:47:51,854 --> 04:47:53,255
AND I WOULD REALLY LOOK FORWARD 

9123
04:47:53,255 --> 04:47:55,024
TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND 

9124
04:47:55,024 --> 04:47:56,525
GETTING YOUR OPINION ON IT. 

9125
04:47:56,525 --> 04:47:57,726
>> SENATOR, WE LOOK FORWARD TO 

9126
04:47:57,726 --> 04:47:59,728
DISCUSSING IT WITH YOU. 

9127
04:47:59,728 --> 04:48:01,130
I WOULD DISAGREE, HOWEVER, THAT 

9128
04:48:01,130 --> 04:48:03,232
WE HAVE NO FINANCIA INCENTIVE 

9129
04:48:03,232 --> 04:48:04,934
OR INCENTIVE OVERALL TO DO 

9130
04:48:04,934 --> 04:48:05,134
THIS. 

9131
04:48:05,134 --> 04:48:05,935
THIS EPISODE HAS CLEARLY HURT 

9132
04:48:05,935 --> 04:48:07,503
US AND IT HAS CLEARLY MADE IT 

9133
04:48:07,503 --> 04:48:09,105
HARDER FOR US TO ACHIEVE THE 

9134
04:48:09,105 --> 04:48:11,507
SOCIAL MISSION THAT WE CARE 

9135
04:48:11,507 --> 04:48:13,309
ABOUT AND WE NOW HAVE TO DO A 

9136
04:48:13,309 --> 04:48:14,676
LOT OF WORK AROUND BUILDING 

9137
04:48:14,676 --> 04:48:16,445
TRUST BACK, WHICH IS JUST A 

9138
04:48:16,445 --> 04:48:17,513
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. 

9139
04:48:17,513 --> 04:48:18,614
>> I THANK YOU. 

9140
04:48:18,614 --> 04:48:19,581
MY TIME IS UP. 

9141
04:48:19,581 --> 04:48:24,053
I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON 

9142
04:48:24,053 --> 04:48:25,020
THAT. 

9143
04:48:25,020 --> 04:48:26,555
>> SENATOR CAPITO. 

9144
04:48:26,555 --> 04:48:29,024
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN, AND 

9145
04:48:29,024 --> 04:48:31,360
THANK YOU, MR. ZUCKERBERG, FOR 

9146
04:48:31,360 --> 04:48:32,160
BEING HERE TODAY. 

9147
04:48:32,160 --> 04:48:34,263
YOU SAID MORE THAN A FEW TIME 

9148
04:48:34,263 --> 04:48:35,131
FACEBOOK USERS CAN DELETE FROM 

9149
04:48:35,131 --> 04:48:37,299
THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME. 

9150
04:48:37,299 --> 04:48:39,968
WE KNOW IN THE COURSE -- I DO. 

9151
04:48:39,968 --> 04:48:41,370
I'VE GOT GRANDCHILDREN NOW, BUT 

9152
04:48:41,370 --> 04:48:42,271
CHILDREN, YOU TELL YOUR 

9153
04:48:42,271 --> 04:48:46,709
CHILDREN ONCE YOU MAKE THAT 

9154
04:48:46,709 --> 04:48:49,812
MARK IN THE INTERNET SYSTEM IT 

9155
04:48:49,812 --> 04:48:51,647
NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY. 

9156
04:48:51,647 --> 04:48:59,788
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ONCE 

9157
04:48:59,788 --> 04:49:00,355
AN INDIVIDUAL DELETES THE 

9158
04:49:00,355 --> 04:49:01,624
INFORMATION FROM THEIR PAGE, 

9159
04:49:01,624 --> 04:49:03,025
IT'S GONE FOREVER FROM 

9160
04:49:03,025 --> 04:49:03,525
FACEBOOK'S ARCHIVES. 

9161
04:49:03,525 --> 04:49:04,893
IS THAT CORRECT? 

9162
04:49:04,893 --> 04:49:05,160
>> YES. 

9163
04:49:05,160 --> 04:49:09,265
I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT, 

9164
04:49:09,265 --> 04:49:10,065
THOUGH, WHICH IS WE WILL DELETE 

9165
04:49:10,065 --> 04:49:12,234
IT FROM OUR SYSTEMS, BUT IF 

9166
04:49:12,234 --> 04:49:13,269
YOU'VE SHARED SOMETHING TO 

9167
04:49:13,269 --> 04:49:14,904
SOMEONE ELSE, THEN WE CAN 

9168
04:49:14,904 --> 04:49:16,305
GUARANTEE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE 

9169
04:49:16,305 --> 04:49:17,907
IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. 

9170
04:49:17,907 --> 04:49:18,174
>> OKAY. 

9171
04:49:18,174 --> 04:49:20,509
SO IF SOMEBODY LEAVES FACEBOOK 

9172
04:49:20,509 --> 04:49:22,812
AND THEN REJOINS AND ASKS 

9173
04:49:22,812 --> 04:49:24,914
FACEBOOK CAN YOU RECREATE MY 

9174
04:49:24,914 --> 04:49:26,015
PAST, YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE? 

9175
04:49:27,482 --> 04:49:28,250
>> IF THEY DELETE THEIR 

9176
04:49:28,250 --> 04:49:29,584
ACCOUNT, THE ANSWER IS NO. 

9177
04:49:29,584 --> 04:49:32,221
THAT'S WHY WE ACTUALLY OFFER 

9178
04:49:32,221 --> 04:49:32,554
TWO OPTIONS. 

9179
04:49:32,554 --> 04:49:33,522
WE OFFER DEACTIVATION WHICH 

9180
04:49:33,522 --> 04:49:35,624
ALLOWS YOU TO SHUT DOWN OR 

9181
04:49:35,624 --> 04:49:36,892
SUSPEND YOUR ACCOUNT BUT NOT 

9182
04:49:36,892 --> 04:49:37,860
DELETE THE INFORMATION BECAUSE 

9183
04:49:37,860 --> 04:49:39,628
ACTUALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT 

9184
04:49:39,628 --> 04:49:41,831
TO AT LEAST FOR SOME PERIOD OF 

9185
04:49:41,831 --> 04:49:43,833
TIME -- WE HEAR STUDENTS WITH 

9186
04:49:43,833 --> 04:49:46,135
EXAMS COMING UP WANT TO NOT BE 

9187
04:49:46,135 --> 04:49:47,136
ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE THEY WANT 

9188
04:49:47,136 --> 04:49:49,070
TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN FOCUS ON 

9189
04:49:49,070 --> 04:49:51,006
THE EXAM, SO THEY DEACTIVATE 

9190
04:49:51,006 --> 04:49:52,107
THEIR ACCOUNT TEMPORARILY BUT 

9191
04:49:52,107 --> 04:49:53,642
THEN WANT THE ABILITY TO TURN 

9192
04:49:53,642 --> 04:49:55,511
IT BACK ON WHEN THEY'RE READY. 

9193
04:49:55,511 --> 04:49:56,445
YOU CAN ALSO DELETE YOUR 

9194
04:49:56,445 --> 04:49:57,646
ACCOUNT, WHICH IS WIPING 

9195
04:49:57,646 --> 04:49:58,147
EVERYTHING. 

9196
04:49:58,147 --> 04:50:00,382
IF YOU DO THAT, YOU CAN'T GET 

9197
04:50:00,382 --> 04:50:00,716
IT BACK. 

9198
04:50:00,716 --> 04:50:02,718
>> IT'S GONE FROM YOUR 

9199
04:50:02,718 --> 04:50:03,118
ARCHIVES. 

9200
04:50:03,118 --> 04:50:03,351
>> YES. 

9201
04:50:03,351 --> 04:50:05,120
>> BUT IS IT EVER REALLY GONE? 

9202
04:50:05,120 --> 04:50:07,022
>> FROM OUR SYSTEMS IT IS. 

9203
04:50:07,022 --> 04:50:09,425
>> FROM THE CLOUD OR WHEREVER 

9204
04:50:09,425 --> 04:50:09,791
IT IS. 

9205
04:50:09,791 --> 04:50:11,327
I MEAN IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE 

9206
04:50:11,327 --> 04:50:12,228
ABLE TO REAPPEAR IN 

9207
04:50:12,228 --> 04:50:13,329
INVESTIGATIONS AND OTHER 

9208
04:50:13,329 --> 04:50:14,430
THINGS, NOT NECESSARILY 

9209
04:50:14,430 --> 04:50:15,931
FACEBOOK, BUT OTHER E-MAILS AND 

9210
04:50:15,931 --> 04:50:18,567
OTHER THINGS OF THAT NATURE. 

9211
04:50:18,567 --> 04:50:19,535
WHAT ABOUT THE INFORMATION 

9212
04:50:19,535 --> 04:50:21,504
GOING FROM THE PAST, THE 

9213
04:50:21,504 --> 04:50:24,340
INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN 

9214
04:50:24,340 --> 04:50:25,474
IN THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA 

9215
04:50:25,474 --> 04:50:25,674
CASE? 

9216
04:50:25,674 --> 04:50:31,547
YOU CAN'T REALLY GO BACK AND 

9217
04:50:31,547 --> 04:50:31,847
REDO THAT. 

9218
04:50:31,847 --> 04:50:33,415
SO I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT 

9219
04:50:33,415 --> 04:50:35,651
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH ON 

9220
04:50:35,651 --> 04:50:37,453
THE IMPROVEMENTS YOU'RE MAKING 

9221
04:50:37,453 --> 04:50:39,321
NOW ON FACEBOOK IS FROM THIS 

9222
04:50:39,321 --> 04:50:39,721
POINT FORWARD. 

9223
04:50:39,721 --> 04:50:40,589
IS THAT A CORRECT ASSUMPTION? 

9224
04:50:40,589 --> 04:50:42,057
>> SENATOR, I THINK WE CAN GO 

9225
04:50:42,057 --> 04:50:43,458
BACK IN SOME CASES AND THAT'S 

9226
04:50:43,458 --> 04:50:45,427
WHY ONE OF THE THINGS I 

9227
04:50:45,427 --> 04:50:46,662
ANNOUNCED IS WE'LL INVESTIGATE 

9228
04:50:46,662 --> 04:50:48,230
EVERY APP THAT HAD ACCESS TO A 

9229
04:50:48,230 --> 04:50:49,632
LARGE ALL OF INFORMATION BEFORE 

9230
04:50:49,632 --> 04:50:51,534
WE LOCKED DOWN PLATFORM IN 

9231
04:50:51,534 --> 04:50:51,734
2014. 

9232
04:50:51,734 --> 04:50:53,736
IF WE FIND ANY PATTERN OF 

9233
04:50:53,736 --> 04:50:54,436
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, THEN WE'LL 

9234
04:50:54,436 --> 04:50:59,041
DO A FULL AUDIT OF THEIR 

9235
04:50:59,041 --> 04:50:59,441
SYSTEMS. 

9236
04:50:59,441 --> 04:51:00,843
IF WE FIND ANYONE IS IMPROPERLY 

9237
04:51:00,843 --> 04:51:02,343
USING DATA, WE'LL TAKE ACTION 

9238
04:51:02,343 --> 04:51:04,747
TO MAKE SURE THEY DELETE THE 

9239
04:51:04,747 --> 04:51:05,848
DATA AND WE'LL INFORM EVERYONE 

9240
04:51:05,848 --> 04:51:11,420
WHO MAY HAVE HAD THEIR USED. 

9241
04:51:11,420 --> 04:51:14,056
>> THE OTHER DISCUSSION I WOULD 

9242
04:51:14,056 --> 04:51:15,523
-- THEIR DATA MISUSED. 

9243
04:51:15,523 --> 04:51:17,226
>> THE OTHER DISCUSSION I WOULD 

9244
04:51:17,226 --> 04:51:18,727
MAKE IS YOU HEARD THE LAPSE IN 

9245
04:51:18,727 --> 04:51:21,163
THE TIME OF WHEN YOU DISCOVERED 

9246
04:51:21,163 --> 04:51:21,830
AND WHEN YOU BECAME TRANSPARENT 

9247
04:51:21,830 --> 04:51:25,534
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU SENT OUT 

9248
04:51:25,534 --> 04:51:27,136
TWO MESSAGES JUST TODAY TO 

9249
04:51:27,136 --> 04:51:27,369
USERS. 

9250
04:51:27,369 --> 04:51:28,804
I WOULD SAY YOU REGRET THAT 

9251
04:51:28,804 --> 04:51:30,105
DECISION, THAT YOU WISH YOU'D 

9252
04:51:30,105 --> 04:51:31,907
BEEN MORE TRANSPARENT AT THE 

9253
04:51:31,907 --> 04:51:32,975
TIME. 

9254
04:51:32,975 --> 04:51:34,143
SO I WOULD IMAGINE IF DURING 

9255
04:51:34,143 --> 04:51:35,044
THE COURSE OF YOUR 

9256
04:51:35,044 --> 04:51:36,345
INVESTIGATION YOU FIND MORE 

9257
04:51:36,345 --> 04:51:38,347
BREACHES, SO TO SPEAK, YOU WILL 

9258
04:51:38,347 --> 04:51:40,315
BE REINFORMING YOUR FACEBOOK 

9259
04:51:40,315 --> 04:51:40,616
CUSTOMERS. 

9260
04:51:40,616 --> 04:51:41,716
>> YES, THAT IS CORRECT. 

9261
04:51:41,716 --> 04:51:43,252
WE HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED THAT 

9262
04:51:43,252 --> 04:51:45,554
IF WE FIND ANY IMPROPER USE, WE 

9263
04:51:45,554 --> 04:51:48,123
WILL INFORM EVERYONE AFFECTED. 

9264
04:51:48,123 --> 04:51:48,724
>> OKAY. 

9265
04:51:48,724 --> 04:51:49,224
THANK YOU. 

9266
04:51:49,224 --> 04:51:50,259
YOU'VE SAID, ALSO, THAT YOU 

9267
04:51:50,259 --> 04:51:53,262
WANT TO HAVE AN ACTIVE VIEW ON 

9268
04:51:53,262 --> 04:51:55,230
CONTROLLING YOUR ECOSYSTEM. 

9269
04:51:55,230 --> 04:51:57,466
LAST WEEK THE FDA COMMISSIONER 

9270
04:51:57,466 --> 04:51:58,734
SCOTT GOTTLIEB ADDRESSED A DRUG 

9271
04:51:58,734 --> 04:52:01,837
SUMMIT IN ATLANTA AND SPOKE ON 

9272
04:52:01,837 --> 04:52:02,604
THE NATIONAL OPIOID EPIDEMIC. 

9273
04:52:02,604 --> 04:52:03,606
I'M FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND 

9274
04:52:03,606 --> 04:52:05,574
THANK YOU FOR VISITING AND NEXT 

9275
04:52:05,574 --> 04:52:08,544
TIME YOU INVEST, IF YOU WOULD 

9276
04:52:08,544 --> 04:52:10,446
PLEASE BRING SOME VISIT, IF YOU 

9277
04:52:10,446 --> 04:52:12,948
WOULD PLEASE BRING SOME FIBER, 

9278
04:52:12,948 --> 04:52:17,152
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE 

9279
04:52:17,152 --> 04:52:18,587
CONNECTIVITY IN OUR RURAL AREAS 

9280
04:52:18,587 --> 04:52:20,689
AND FACEBOOK COULD REALLY HELP 

9281
04:52:20,689 --> 04:52:21,957
US WITH THAT. 

9282
04:52:21,957 --> 04:52:22,557
THE COMMISSIONER MENTIONED 

9283
04:52:22,557 --> 04:52:23,859
FACEBOOK WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 

9284
04:52:23,859 --> 04:52:25,561
IT TO TRY TO DISRUPT THE SALE 

9285
04:52:25,561 --> 04:52:30,032
OF ILLEGAL DRUGS AND 

9286
04:52:30,032 --> 04:52:31,266
PARTICULARLY THE POWERFUL 

9287
04:52:31,266 --> 04:52:33,369
OPIOID FENTANYL WHICH HUBBIESED 

9288
04:52:33,369 --> 04:52:36,171
AND SOLD ONLINE. 

9289
04:52:36,171 --> 04:52:40,876
I -- WHICH HAS BEEN ADVERTISED 

9290
04:52:40,876 --> 04:52:41,877
AND SOLD ONLINE. 

9291
04:52:41,877 --> 04:52:43,979
I WANT TO NOTE CAN I GET A 

9292
04:52:43,979 --> 04:52:44,646
COMMITMENT TODAY THAT FACEBOOK 

9293
04:52:44,646 --> 04:52:48,150
WILL COMMIT TO HAVING A 

9294
04:52:48,150 --> 04:52:48,784
REPRESENTATIVE FOR COMMISSIONER 

9295
04:52:48,784 --> 04:52:50,619
GOTTLIEB TO FINALIZE WITH THIS 

9296
04:52:50,619 --> 04:52:50,886
MEETING. 

9297
04:52:50,886 --> 04:52:51,820
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN 

9298
04:52:51,820 --> 04:52:52,655
IMPORTANT INITIATIVE AND WE 

9299
04:52:52,655 --> 04:52:54,356
WILL SEND SOMEONE AND ON YOUR 

9300
04:52:54,356 --> 04:52:55,658
POINT ABOUT CONNECTIVITY WE DO 

9301
04:52:55,658 --> 04:52:56,859
HAVE A GROUP AT FACEBOOK THAT 

9302
04:52:56,859 --> 04:52:59,161
IS WORKING ON TRYING TO SPREAD 

9303
04:52:59,161 --> 04:53:00,062
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IN RURAL 

9304
04:53:00,062 --> 04:53:01,363
AREAS AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO 

9305
04:53:01,363 --> 04:53:04,266
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT AS 

9306
04:53:04,266 --> 04:53:04,933
WELL. 

9307
04:53:04,933 --> 04:53:08,771
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY 

9308
04:53:08,771 --> 04:53:09,204
PASSIONATE ABOUT. 

9309
04:53:09,204 --> 04:53:10,706
>> THAT'S GOOD NEWS. 

9310
04:53:10,706 --> 04:53:12,374
LAST QUESTION, IF SOMEBODY 

9311
04:53:12,374 --> 04:53:13,442
ADVERTISES ON FACEBOOK AND 

9312
04:53:13,442 --> 04:53:14,243
SOMEBODY PURCHASES SOMETHING, 

9313
04:53:14,243 --> 04:53:15,377
DOES FACEBOOK GET A PERCENTAGE 

9314
04:53:15,377 --> 04:53:17,479
OR ANY KIND OF A FEE ASSOCIATED 

9315
04:53:17,479 --> 04:53:19,180
WITH A SUCCESSFUL PURCHASE FROM 

9316
04:53:19,180 --> 04:53:19,715
AN ADVERTISER? 

9317
04:53:21,350 --> 04:53:21,717
>> SENATOR, NO. 

9318
04:53:21,717 --> 04:53:24,653
THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS 

9319
04:53:24,653 --> 04:53:28,857
IS PEOPLE -- ADVERTISERS BID 

9320
04:53:28,857 --> 04:53:30,759
HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH IT TO THEM 

9321
04:53:30,759 --> 04:53:33,162
TO SHOW AN AD OR WHEN AN ACTION 

9322
04:53:33,162 --> 04:53:33,429
HAPPENS. 

9323
04:53:33,429 --> 04:53:34,963
SO IT'S NOT THAT WE WOULD GET A 

9324
04:53:34,963 --> 04:53:36,765
PERCENT OF THE SALE, BUT LET'S 

9325
04:53:36,765 --> 04:53:38,533
JUST USE AN EXAMPLE. 

9326
04:53:38,533 --> 04:53:39,668
LET'S SAY YOU'RE AN APP 

9327
04:53:39,668 --> 04:53:40,969
DEVELOPER AND YOUR GOAL IS YOU 

9328
04:53:40,969 --> 04:53:43,138
WANT TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO 

9329
04:53:43,138 --> 04:53:44,239
INSTALL YOUR APP. 

9330
04:53:44,239 --> 04:53:45,874
YOU COULD BID IN THE AD SYSTEM 

9331
04:53:45,874 --> 04:53:49,445
AND SAY I WILL PAY $3 ANY TIME 

9332
04:53:49,445 --> 04:53:51,547
SOMEONE INSTALLS THIS APP AND 

9333
04:53:51,547 --> 04:53:53,248
THEN WE BASICALLY CALCULATE ON 

9334
04:53:53,248 --> 04:53:58,187
OUR SIDE WHICH ADS ARE GOING TO 

9335
04:53:58,187 --> 04:54:00,155
BE RELEVANT FOR PEOPLE AND WE 

9336
04:54:00,155 --> 04:54:01,490
HAVE INCENTIVE TO SHOW PEOPLE 

9337
04:54:01,490 --> 04:54:02,558
ADS THAT ARE RELEVANT BECAUSE 

9338
04:54:02,558 --> 04:54:03,959
WE ONLY GET PAID WHEN IT 

9339
04:54:03,959 --> 04:54:05,026
DELIVERS A BUSINESS RESULT AND 

9340
04:54:05,026 --> 04:54:13,469
THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. 

9341
04:54:13,469 --> 04:54:14,837
WE GET PAID WHEN THE ACTION 

9342
04:54:14,837 --> 04:54:18,741
THAT THE ADVERTISER WANTS TO 

9343
04:54:18,741 --> 04:54:19,440
HAPPEN HAPPENS. 

9344
04:54:19,440 --> 04:54:20,208
>> SENATOR CORTEZ. 

9345
04:54:20,208 --> 04:54:21,143
>> THANK YOU. 

9346
04:54:21,143 --> 04:54:22,244
MR. ZUCKERBERG, THANK YOU. 

9347
04:54:22,244 --> 04:54:23,478
IT'S BEEN A LONG AFTERNOON AND 

9348
04:54:23,478 --> 04:54:24,446
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND 

9349
04:54:24,446 --> 04:54:26,181
TAKING THE TIME WITH EVERY 

9350
04:54:26,181 --> 04:54:27,448
SINGLE ONE OF US. 

9351
04:54:27,448 --> 04:54:29,284
I'M GOING TO ECHO A LOT OF WHAT 

9352
04:54:29,284 --> 04:54:30,486
I'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUES SAY 

9353
04:54:30,486 --> 04:54:31,453
TODAY AS WELL. 

9354
04:54:31,453 --> 04:54:32,855
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. 

9355
04:54:32,855 --> 04:54:35,057
I APPRECIATE THE APOLOGY, BUT 

9356
04:54:35,057 --> 04:54:36,859
STOP APOLOGIZING AND LET'S MAKE 

9357
04:54:36,859 --> 04:54:37,192
THE CHANGE. 

9358
04:54:37,192 --> 04:54:39,895
I THINK IT'S TIME TO REALLY 

9359
04:54:39,895 --> 04:54:40,728
CHANGE THE CONDUCT. 

9360
04:54:40,728 --> 04:54:42,798
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU 

9361
04:54:42,798 --> 04:54:44,266
TALKED ABOUT YOUR PRINCIPLES 

9362
04:54:44,266 --> 04:54:45,667
FOR FACEBOOK, NOTICED USERS ON 

9363
04:54:45,667 --> 04:54:47,502
THE USE OF THE DATA AND THAT 

9364
04:54:47,502 --> 04:54:49,238
USERS HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF 

9365
04:54:49,238 --> 04:54:50,439
THEIR DATA, BUT THE SKEPTICISM 

9366
04:54:50,439 --> 04:54:52,073
THAT I HAVE AND I'M HOPING YOU 

9367
04:54:52,073 --> 04:54:55,277
CAN HELP ME WITH THIS IS OVER 

9368
04:54:55,277 --> 04:55:00,482
THE LAST WHAT, SEVEN YEARS 

9369
04:55:00,482 --> 04:55:01,784
HAVEN'T SEEN REALLY MUCH CHANGE 

9370
04:55:01,784 --> 04:55:03,485
IN INSURING THAT THE PRIVACY IS 

9371
04:55:03,485 --> 04:55:05,087
THERE AND THAT INDIVIDUAL USERS 

9372
04:55:05,087 --> 04:55:08,257
HAVE CONTROL OF THEIR DATA. 

9373
04:55:08,257 --> 04:55:10,959
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

9374
04:55:10,959 --> 04:55:13,595
BACK IN 2009 YOU MADE TWO 

9375
04:55:13,595 --> 04:55:15,297
CHANGES TO YOUR PRIVACY POLICY 

9376
04:55:15,297 --> 04:55:19,568
AND, IN FACT, PRIOR TO THAT 

9377
04:55:19,568 --> 04:55:20,369
MOST USERS COULD EITHER 

9378
04:55:20,369 --> 04:55:21,637
IDENTIFY ONLY FRIENDS OR 

9379
04:55:21,637 --> 04:55:24,540
FRIENDS OF FRIENDS AS PART OF 

9380
04:55:24,540 --> 04:55:25,974
THEIR PRIVACY. 

9381
04:55:25,974 --> 04:55:26,140
CORRECT? 

9382
04:55:26,908 --> 04:55:28,677
IF THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THEIR 

9383
04:55:28,677 --> 04:55:29,878
DATA, THEY COULD IDENTIFY ONLY

9394
04:55:45,527 --> 04:55:48,130

OPTIONS.

>> IN 2011 WHEN THE FTC BEGAN 

9402
04:55:58,907 --> 04:56:00,342
LOOKING AT THIS, THEY WERE 

9403
04:56:00,342 --> 04:56:03,712
CONCERNED THAT IF SOMEBODY

CHOSE ONLY FRIENDS, THAT THE 

9405
04:56:05,314 --> 04:56:06,815
INDIVIDUAL USER WAS UNDER THE 

9406
04:56:06,815 --> 04:56:07,816
IMPRESSION THEY COULD CONTINUE 

9407
04:56:07,816 --> 04:56:09,918
TO RESTRICT SHARING OF DATA TO 

9408
04:56:09,918 --> 04:56:10,919
A LIMITED AUDIENCE, BUT THAT 

9409
04:56:10,919 --> 04:56:12,621
WASN'T THE CASE AND, IN FACT, 

9410
04:56:12,621 --> 04:56:14,489
SELECTING FRIENDS ONLY DID NOT 

9411
04:56:14,489 --> 04:56:15,724
PREVENT USERS' INFORMATION FROM

ISN'T THAT THE CASE AND THAT'S 

9415
04:56:21,830 --> 04:56:24,633
WHY THE FTC WAS LOOKING AT YOU 

9416
04:56:24,633 --> 04:56:26,535
AND MAKING THAT CHANGE BECAUSE 

9417
04:56:26,535 --> 04:56:27,836
THERE WAS CONCERN THAT IF YOU 

9418
04:56:27,836 --> 04:56:30,606
HAD FRIENDS ON YOUR PAGE, A 

9419
04:56:30,606 --> 04:56:32,975
THIRD PARTY COULD ACCESS THAT 

9420

INFORMATION? 

9421

QUESTION FROM SENATOR PATRICK 

9594
05:04:30,918 --> 05:04:31,752
LEAHY, ZUCKERBERG SAID FACEBOOK 

9595
05:04:31,752 --> 05:04:33,655
IS COOPERATING WITH

9596
05:04:33,655 --> 05:04:34,656

RUSSIAN MEDDLING. 

9599
05:04:38,126 --> 05:04:39,360
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS WELL-

9600
05:04:39,360 --> 05:04:40,795
KNOWN? 

9601
05:04:40,795 --> 05:04:41,863
>> Reporter: IT WAS NOT. 

9602
05:04:41,863 --> 05:04:48,903
NOR WAS THE FACT THAT SOME 

9603
05:04:48,903 --> 05:04:49,570
FACEBOOK EXECUTIVES ACCORDING 

9604
05:04:49,570 --> 05:04:50,472
TO ZUCKERBERG, HAVE ACTUALLY 

9605
05:04:50,472 --> 05:04:51,606
BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE SPECIAL 

9606
05:04:51,606 --> 05:04:52,540
COUNSEL, WHICH IS LOOKING INTO 

9607
05:04:52,540 --> 05:04:53,441
RUSSIAN ELECTION MEDDLING WHICH 

9608
05:04:53,441 --> 05:04:54,975
WE KNOW TOOK PLACE BOTH ON 

9609
05:04:54,975 --> 05:04:57,312
FACEBOOK SITE AND ELSEWHERE. 

9610
05:04:57,312 --> 05:04:58,846
ZUCKERBERG SAID HE HIMSELF HAS 

9611
05:04:58,846 --> 05:05:03,351
NOT BEEN INTERVIEWED, AND THEN 

9612
05:05:03,351 --> 05:05:04,919
HE EVEN WENT SO FAR TO SAY THAT 

9613
05:05:04,919 --> 05:05:06,120
HE THOUGHT THAT FACEBOOK HAS 

9614
05:05:06,120 --> 05:05:13,828
BEEN SERVED A SUOENA BY THE 

9615
05:05:13,828 --> 05:05:14,228
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

9616
05:05:14,228 --> 05:05:15,397
HE LATER MODIFIED THAT AND SAID 

9617
05:05:15,397 --> 05:05:16,765
HE WASN'T SURE WHETHER THEY HAD 

9618
05:05:16,765 --> 05:05:17,832
GOTTEN A SUBPOENA OR NOT. 

9619
05:05:17,832 --> 05:05:19,067
AND ADDED HE DIDN'T WANT TO 

9620
05:05:19,067 --> 05:05:20,334
GIVE A LOT OF DETAILS BECAUSE 

9621
05:05:20,334 --> 05:05:21,336
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY 

9622
05:05:21,336 --> 05:05:22,404
SERIOUS AND ONGOING 

9623
05:05:22,404 --> 05:05:22,971
INVESTIGATION. 

9624
05:05:22,971 --> 05:05:24,472
BUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO 

9625
05:05:24,472 --> 05:05:27,208
LEARN THAT FACEBOOK IS ACTIVELY 

9626
05:05:27,208 --> 05:05:32,313
WORKING WITH THE SPECIAL 

9627
05:05:32,313 --> 05:05:33,648
COUNSEL AND LEADS YOU TO WONDER 

9628
05:05:33,648 --> 05:05:34,783
HOW MANY OTHER TECH COMPANIES 

9629
05:05:34,783 --> 05:05:35,583
ARE DOING THE SAME. 

9630
05:05:35,583 --> 05:05:46,428
>> NANCY, WE HEARD FROM SENATOR 

9631
05:05:46,428 --> 05:05:47,328
LINDSEY GRAHAM, HE ASKED 

9632
05:05:47,328 --> 05:05:48,430
ZUCKERBERG ABOUT A LACK OF 

9633
05:05:48,430 --> 05:05:49,530
COMPETITION AND OF HIS COMPANY 

9634
05:05:49,530 --> 05:05:50,230
IS A MONOPOLY. 

9635
05:05:50,230 --> 05:05:51,433
COULD WE SEE LAWMAKERS MOVE TO 

9636
05:05:51,433 --> 05:05:52,399
TRY TO REGULATE FACEBOOK AND 

9637
05:05:52,399 --> 05:05:53,468
OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES? 

9638
05:05:53,468 --> 05:05:54,969
>> Reporter: THERE IS CERTAINLY 

9639
05:05:54,969 --> 05:05:56,304
A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN 

9640
05:05:56,304 --> 05:05:56,537
THAT. 

9641
05:05:56,537 --> 05:05:57,439
THERE ARE MANY DEMOCRATS IN 

9642
05:05:57,439 --> 05:05:58,573
PARTICULAR WHO FEEL THAT THIS 

9643
05:05:58,573 --> 05:05:59,506
IS AN UNDER-REGULATED INDUSTRY. 

9644
05:05:59,506 --> 05:06:00,675
THAT IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE SOME 

9645
05:06:00,675 --> 05:06:06,314
PRIVACY CONTROLS IMPOSED BY THE 

9646
05:06:06,314 --> 05:06:06,747
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 

9647
05:06:06,747 --> 05:06:07,649
THEY DON'T TRUST FACEBOOK AND 

9648
05:06:07,649 --> 05:06:08,716
SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPANIES 

9649
05:06:08,716 --> 05:06:10,852
TO SELF REGULATE. 

9650
05:06:10,852 --> 05:06:11,753
THEY SAY FACEBOOK HAS 

9651
05:06:11,753 --> 05:06:12,820
APOLOGIZED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 

9652
05:06:12,820 --> 05:06:18,960
AND HAS MADE SOME TOKEN ATTEMPTS

9653
05:06:18,960 --> 05:06:20,194
TO IMPOSE NEW PRIVACY CONTROLS 

9654
05:06:20,194 --> 05:06:21,563
ITSELF, BUT CLEARLY THEY DON'T 

9655
05:06:21,563 --> 05:06:22,296
BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS 

9656
05:06:22,296 --> 05:06:24,833
GONE FAR ENOUGH. 

9657
05:06:24,833 --> 05:06:26,167
THE REALITY IS THAT CONGRESS IS 

9658
05:06:26,167 --> 05:06:26,901
CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS WHO 

9659
05:06:26,901 --> 05:06:30,972
HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ROLL BACK 

9660
05:06:30,972 --> 05:06:31,706
REGULATIONS, NOT IMPOSE NEW 

9661
05:06:31,706 --> 05:06:31,906
ONES. 

9662
05:06:31,906 --> 05:06:32,807
THE LIKELIHOOD THEY ARE GOING 

9663
05:06:32,807 --> 05:06:34,909
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN AN 

9664
05:06:34,909 --> 05:06:36,077
ELECTION YEAR WHERE THEY ARE 

9665
05:06:36,077 --> 05:06:37,212
GETTING VERY LITTLE DONE AS IT 

9666
05:06:37,212 --> 05:06:38,913
IS AS THEY PREPARE FOR MIDTERMS 

9667
05:06:38,913 --> 05:06:45,620
COMING UP, IT'S PRETTY 

9668
05:06:45,620 --> 05:06:45,887
UNLIKELY. 

9669
05:06:45,887 --> 05:06:46,521
>> ZUCKERBERG WILL TESTIFY 

9670
05:06:46,521 --> 05:06:47,689
BEFORE THE HOUSE ON WEDNESDAY. 

9671
05:06:47,689 --> 05:06:48,857
HOW WILL THAT DIFFER FROM WHAT 

9672
05:06:48,857 --> 05:06:49,490
WE SAW ON TUESDAY? 

9673
05:06:49,490 --> 05:06:50,724
>> Reporter: THE HOUSE TENDS TO 

9674
05:06:50,724 --> 05:06:52,060
BE MORE FREEWHEELING, THE 

9675
05:06:52,060 --> 05:06:52,961
QUESTIONS THAT ZUCKERBERG HAS 

9676
05:06:52,961 --> 05:06:55,430
BEEN GETTING IN THE SENATE HAVE 

9677
05:06:55,430 --> 05:06:56,630
BY AND LARGE PERTAINED TO THE 

9678
05:06:56,630 --> 05:06:57,531
ISSUE AT HAND. 

9679
05:06:57,531 --> 05:07:02,637
TO PRIVACY, RUSSIA, BUT HE 

9680
05:07:02,637 --> 05:07:03,972
COULD GET QUESTIONS THAT GO A 

9681
05:07:03,972 --> 05:07:05,673
LOT FURTHER AFIELD WHEN HE IS 

9682
05:07:05,673 --> 05:07:07,742
GOING BEFORE THE HOUSE. 

9683
05:07:07,742 --> 05:07:09,110
HE DOES NOW HAVE MANY HOURS OF 

9684
05:07:09,110 --> 05:07:18,152
EXPERIENCE UNDER HIS BELT. 

9685
05:07:18,152 --> 05:07:19,721
YOU COULD SEE HIM GET MORE AND 

9686
05:07:19,721 --> 05:07:20,488
MORE COMFORTABLE AS THIS 

9687
05:07:20,488 --> 05:07:21,255
HEARING WENT ALONG. 

9688
05:07:21,255 --> 05:07:22,456
IT IS HIS FIRST TIME TESTIFYING 

9689
05:07:22,456 --> 05:07:23,358
BEFORE CONGRESS, AND LIKE 

9690
05:07:23,358 --> 05:07:24,592
ANYONE, HE WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS 

9691
05:07:24,592 --> 05:07:25,393
AT THE BEGINNING. 

9692
05:07:25,393 --> 05:07:26,528
WHO WOULDN'T BE WHEN THEY ARE 

9693
05:07:26,528 --> 05:07:27,695
CONFRONTED WITH 50 CAMERAS IN 

9694
05:07:27,695 --> 05:07:27,995
THEIR FACE? 

9695
05:07:27,995 --> 05:07:29,096
RIGHT BEFORE THEY START TO GET 

9696
05:07:29,096 --> 05:07:32,100
GRILLED BY SENATORS. 

9697
05:07:32,100 --> 05:07:33,701
BUT HE STARTED TO LOOSEN UP AND 

9698
05:07:33,701 --> 05:07:35,270
IN FACT WHEN HE WAS OFFERED A 

9699
05:07:35,270 --> 05:07:36,370
BREAK AFTER KATE -- AFTER A 

9700
05:07:36,370 --> 05:07:37,438
COUPLE HOURS BY THE COMMERCE 

9701
05:07:37,438 --> 05:07:39,207
úC 

9702
05:07:39,207 --> 05:07:40,608
HE SAID NO, I'M ACTUALLY KIND 

9703
05:07:40,608 --> 05:07:42,744
OF ENJOYING THIS, LET'S GO ON A 

9704
05:07:42,744 --> 05:07:44,145
LITTLE BIT LONGER. 

9705
05:07:44,145 --> 05:07:45,279
AND JOHN KUHN SAID OKAY, SURE. 

9706
05:07:45,279 --> 05:07:46,346
SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING 

9707
05:07:46,346 --> 05:07:49,083
THAT ZUCKERBERG HAS GOTTEN 

9708
05:07:49,083 --> 05:07:55,022
PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH AS THE 

9709
05:07:55,022 --> 05:07:55,689
HOURS STRETCH ON. 

9710
05:07:55,689 --> 05:07:57,191
>> NANCY, I NEED TO ASK YOU 

9711
05:07:57,191 --> 05:07:58,092
ABOUT THAT FOUR-INCH CUSHION 

9712
05:07:58,092 --> 05:07:59,961
THAT ZUCKERBERG SET ON IN HIS 

9713
05:07:59,961 --> 05:08:00,361
SENATE HEARING. 

9714
05:08:00,361 --> 05:08:01,596
IT IS GETTING A LOT OF 

9715
05:08:01,596 --> 05:08:01,896
ATTENTION. 

9716
05:08:01,896 --> 05:08:02,730
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? 

9717
05:08:02,730 --> 05:08:03,998
>> Reporter: WE HAVE BEEN DOING 

9718
05:08:03,998 --> 05:08:05,065
SOME DIGGING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 

9719
05:08:05,065 --> 05:08:07,268
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS 

9720
05:08:07,268 --> 05:08:09,671
CAUGHT ON ON SOCIAL MEDIA, 

9721
05:08:09,671 --> 05:08:12,774
PEOPLE ASKING WHETHER FACEBOOK 

9722
05:08:12,774 --> 05:08:14,475
USED THIS CUSHION TO MAKE HIM 

9723
05:08:14,475 --> 05:08:16,678
LOOK TALLER, LOOK MORE 

9724
05:08:16,678 --> 05:08:21,983
IMPOSING, WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT

9725
05:08:21,983 --> 05:08:23,418
A LOT OF THESE HEARINGS COME 

9726
05:08:23,418 --> 05:08:24,786
DOWN TO OPTICS, BUT HERE'S WHAT 

9727
05:08:24,786 --> 05:08:25,620
I CAN TELL YOU. 

9728
05:08:25,620 --> 05:08:27,922
I HAVE SPOKEN TO A SENATE 

9729
05:08:27,922 --> 05:08:28,790
COMMERCE COMMITTEE AIDE WHO 

9730
05:08:28,790 --> 05:08:29,958
SAYS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 

9731
05:08:29,958 --> 05:08:31,092
WAS REQUESTED BY FACEBOOK. 

9732
05:08:31,092 --> 05:08:33,027
IT IS SIMPLY PART OF THE SETUP 

9733
05:08:33,027 --> 05:08:34,095
OF THE ROOM. 

9734
05:08:34,095 --> 05:08:39,000
THAT OFTEN FOLKS WHO ARE 

9735
05:08:39,000 --> 05:08:39,901
TESTIFYING GET THESE CUSHIONS 

9736
05:08:39,901 --> 05:08:40,635
BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE 

9737
05:08:40,635 --> 05:08:41,936
AND BECAUSE IT MAKES IT EASIER 

9738
05:08:41,936 --> 05:08:46,407
TO SEE THEM OVER THESE LARGE 

9739
05:08:46,407 --> 05:08:47,274
DESKS THEY SIT BEHIND. 

9740
05:08:47,274 --> 05:08:48,709
I ALSO REACHED OUT TO FACEBOOK 

9741
05:08:48,709 --> 05:08:50,545
AND THEY BASICALLY SAID THE 

9742
05:08:50,545 --> 05:08:51,879
SAME THING, THEY DID NOT ASK 

9743
05:08:51,879 --> 05:08:53,514
FOR THIS CUSHION, THAT IT WAS 

9744
05:08:53,514 --> 05:08:57,085
SIMPLY PROVIDED BY THE 

9745
05:08:57,085 --> 05:08:57,385
COMMITTEE. 

9746
05:08:57,385 --> 05:08:59,420
IF WE GET MORE ON THIS, YOU 

9747
05:08:59,420 --> 05:09:00,821
WILL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW. 

9748
05:09:00,821 --> 05:09:04,058
BUT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S 

9749
05:09:04,058 --> 05:09:10,865
A BIG GRAND SCHEME RIGHT NOW. 

9750
05:09:10,865 --> 05:09:12,433
>> WE CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU 

9751
05:09:12,433 --> 05:09:14,268
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. 

9752
05:09:14,268 --> 05:09:15,503
NANCY CORDES, THANK YOU VERY 

9753
05:09:15,503 --> 05:09:15,703
MUCH. 

9754
05:09:15,703 --> 05:09:16,236
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 

9755
05:09:16,236 --> 05:09:18,773
>>> FOR MORE ON TUESDAYS 

9756
05:09:18,773 --> 05:09:19,674
FACEBOOK HEARING, I WANT TO 

9757
05:09:19,674 --> 05:09:22,477
BRING IN DAN PATTERSON, SENIOR 

9758
05:09:22,477 --> 05:09:23,444
WRITER FOR TECHREPUBLIC AND 

9759
05:09:23,444 --> 05:09:24,778
ALSO HERE WITH ME, JENNIFER 

9760
05:09:24,778 --> 05:09:30,751
GRYGIEL, PROFESSOR OF 

9761
05:09:30,751 --> 05:09:31,585
COMMUNICATIONS AT SYRACUSE. 

9762
05:09:31,585 --> 05:09:32,286
AND ROGER CHENG, EXECUTIVE 

9763
05:09:32,286 --> 05:09:33,520
úEDI 

9764
05:09:33,520 --> 05:09:40,328
FOR BEING HERE. 

9765
05:09:40,328 --> 05:09:41,795
LET'S START WITH HOW DID HE DO? 

9766
05:09:41,795 --> 05:09:43,131
WAS THIS A GOOD DAY FOR 

9767
05:09:43,131 --> 05:09:43,431
ZUCKERBERG? 

9768
05:09:43,431 --> 05:09:43,965
>> A GREAT DAY. 

9769
05:09:43,965 --> 05:09:45,066
IN TERMS OF HIS PERFORMANCE, HE 

9770
05:09:45,066 --> 05:09:46,000
OVER PERFORMED EXPECTATIONS. 

9771
05:09:46,000 --> 05:09:47,335
HE WAS ABLE TO DODGE AND BLOCK 

9772
05:09:47,335 --> 05:09:48,803
A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 

9773
05:09:48,803 --> 05:09:50,204
WERE FROM THE LUDDITE SENATORS. 

9774
05:09:50,204 --> 05:09:52,707
AND FOR THE TECH SAVVY 

9775
05:09:52,707 --> 05:09:53,741
SENATORS, HE WAS ABLE TO SPIN 

9776
05:09:53,741 --> 05:10:03,084
AND PUSH AWAY QUESTIONS THAT 

9777
05:10:03,084 --> 05:10:03,917
WOULD BE INCISIVE. 

9778
05:10:03,917 --> 05:10:04,619
WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH. 

9779
05:10:04,619 --> 05:10:06,587
IF IF -- IF I WAS ON HIS PR 

9780
05:10:06,587 --> 05:10:08,155
TEAM, I WOULD BE HIGH-FIVING. 

9781
05:10:08,155 --> 05:10:13,561
>> JENNIFER, WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE 

9782
05:10:13,561 --> 05:10:14,695
AWAY WHEN YOU WATCHED HIM? 

9783
05:10:14,695 --> 05:10:15,963
SEEMED AS IF HE GOT MORE 

9784
05:10:15,963 --> 05:10:16,898
COMFORTABLE, HE WAS RESPECTFUL, 

9785
05:10:16,898 --> 05:10:18,066
NOT KNOWN FOR BEING A DYNAMIC 

9786
05:10:18,066 --> 05:10:19,133
PERSONALITY, BUT HOW DO YOU 

9787
05:10:19,133 --> 05:10:19,834
THINK HE DID? 

9788
05:10:19,834 --> 05:10:20,902
>> TODAY WAS A VERY IMPORTANT 

9789
05:10:20,902 --> 05:10:22,670
DAY FOR THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL 

9790
05:10:22,670 --> 05:10:22,903
MEDIA. 

9791
05:10:22,903 --> 05:10:24,572
MARK ZUCKERBERG IS THE CEO AND 

9792
05:10:24,572 --> 05:10:25,539
MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER. 

9793
05:10:25,539 --> 05:10:30,511
ALSO OWNS WHATSAPP, INSTAGRAM 

9794
05:10:30,511 --> 05:10:30,945
AND MESSENGER. 

9795
05:10:30,945 --> 05:10:32,113
HE SHOWED UP TODAY AND I THINK 

9796
05:10:32,113 --> 05:10:33,214
HE ANSWERED SOME TOUGH 

9797
05:10:33,214 --> 05:10:35,683
QUESTIONS. 

9798
05:10:35,683 --> 05:10:37,051
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FOLLOW-ON 

9799
05:10:37,051 --> 05:10:38,152
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. 

9800
05:10:38,152 --> 05:10:41,656
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW

9801
05:10:41,656 --> 05:10:43,291
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RIGHT SOME 

9802
05:10:43,291 --> 05:10:44,258
REGULATIONS FOR A SAFER 

9803
05:10:44,258 --> 05:10:44,591
ENVIRONMENT. 

9804
05:10:44,591 --> 05:10:45,393
>> AS WE HEARD FROM LINDSEY 

9805
05:10:45,393 --> 05:10:46,327
GRAHAM AS WE WERE JUST 

9806
05:10:46,327 --> 05:10:47,361
DISCUSSING, IS FACEBOOK A 

9807
05:10:47,361 --> 05:10:48,629
MONOPOLY? 

9808
05:10:48,629 --> 05:10:53,901
SHOULD THERE BE REGULATIONS? 

9809
05:10:53,901 --> 05:10:55,269
ROGER, WHAT DID YOU TAKE AWAY 

9810
05:10:55,269 --> 05:10:56,604
FROM WHAT WE HEARD ON THAT 

9811
05:10:56,604 --> 05:10:56,837
TOPIC? 

9812
05:10:56,837 --> 05:10:57,538
>> WE HEARD FROM ZUCKERBERG 

9813
05:10:57,538 --> 05:10:58,906
THAT HE IS OPEN TO REGULATION 

9814
05:10:58,906 --> 05:11:00,341
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ON 

9815
05:11:00,341 --> 05:11:02,276
HIS TERMS, HE USED THE TERM THE 

9816
05:11:02,276 --> 05:11:06,147
RIGHT REGULATION, WHEN HE WAS 

9817
05:11:06,147 --> 05:11:07,281
ASKED SEVERAL TIMES WHETHER OR 

9818
05:11:07,281 --> 05:11:10,518
NOT HE WOULD BE SUPPORTING OPT 

9819
05:11:10,518 --> 05:11:11,418
IN MEASURES FOR HIS SERVICE. 

9820
05:11:11,418 --> 05:11:14,222
HE SAID YES, IN PRINCIPLE. 

9821
05:11:14,222 --> 05:11:15,790
HE COACHED A LOT OF HIS ANSWERS 

9822
05:11:15,790 --> 05:11:18,126
AND DID VERY WELL -- BUT HE 

9823
05:11:18,126 --> 05:11:19,726
FOUND A WAY TO KIND OF GET OUT 

9824
05:11:19,726 --> 05:11:23,865
OF ANY TIME HE WAS BACKED INTO 

9825
05:11:23,865 --> 05:11:25,265
A CORNER HE GOT OUT OF THE 

9826
05:11:25,265 --> 05:11:26,066
QUESTION FAIRLY SMARTLY. 

9827
05:11:26,066 --> 05:11:27,335
>> DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE 

9828
05:11:27,335 --> 05:11:27,668
REGULATIONS? 

9829
05:11:27,668 --> 05:11:30,605
>> SEEMS LIKE THERE WILL BE, 

9830
05:11:30,605 --> 05:11:31,773
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHO IS 

9831
05:11:31,773 --> 05:11:32,739
GOING TO DICTATE WHAT THE 

9832
05:11:32,739 --> 05:11:33,607
REGULATIONS LOOK LIKE? 

9833
05:11:33,607 --> 05:11:36,177
AS WE'VE SEEN TODAY WITH THE 

9834
05:11:36,177 --> 05:11:37,612
QUESTIONS, A LOT OF SENATORS 

9835
05:11:37,612 --> 05:11:41,348
ARE ILL-EQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND 

9836
05:11:41,348 --> 05:11:42,683
WHAT FACEBOOK DOES AND EVEN ITS 

9837
05:11:42,683 --> 05:11:43,717
CORE MODEL, SO IT'S UNCLEAR 

9838
05:11:43,717 --> 05:11:44,952
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GOING 

9839
05:11:44,952 --> 05:11:47,355
TO BE CAPABLE OR JUST TAKE 

9840
05:11:47,355 --> 05:11:50,792
ZUCKERBERG'S SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT

9841
05:11:50,792 --> 05:11:52,160
REGULATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE. 

9842
05:11:52,160 --> 05:11:53,628
>> INTERESTING POINT. 

9843
05:11:53,628 --> 05:11:54,828
DO YOU THINK THE SENATORS ARE 

9844
05:11:54,828 --> 05:11:56,197
THE BEST PEOPLE TO BE 

9845
05:11:56,197 --> 05:11:58,299
QUESTIONING HIM ON THIS? 

9846
05:11:58,299 --> 05:12:01,803
>> THEY ARE THE PEOPLE'S 

9847
05:12:01,803 --> 05:12:02,670
REPRESENTATIVES AND WHEN YOU 

9848
05:12:02,670 --> 05:12:03,937
HAVE A PLATFORM OF THE SCALE OF 

9849
05:12:03,937 --> 05:12:05,139
2 BILLION PEOPLE, THERE'S A LOT 

9850
05:12:05,139 --> 05:12:13,915
OF AMERICANS IN THAT SAMPLE. 

9851
05:12:13,915 --> 05:12:15,016
THEY ARE NOT THE MOST 

9852
05:12:15,016 --> 05:12:16,184
TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY GROUP AS 

9853
05:12:16,184 --> 05:12:16,451
WE KNOW. 

9854
05:12:16,451 --> 05:12:17,985
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS A 

9855
05:12:17,985 --> 05:12:18,686
REQUIREMENT THAT YOU BE 

9856
05:12:18,686 --> 05:12:19,554
TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY IN ORDER 

9857
05:12:19,554 --> 05:12:20,488
TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL 

9858
05:12:20,488 --> 05:12:21,255
MECHANICS OF FACEBOOK. 

9859
05:12:21,255 --> 05:12:23,624
OR TO ASK THAT YOUR PRIVACY BE 

9860
05:12:23,624 --> 05:12:23,924
RESPECTED. 

9861
05:12:23,924 --> 05:12:24,992
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY 

9862
05:12:24,992 --> 05:12:26,627
IMPORTANT. 

9863
05:12:26,627 --> 05:12:27,995
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW CODE 

9864
05:12:27,995 --> 05:12:29,529
IN ORDER FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND 

9865
05:12:29,529 --> 05:12:33,767
ACTIVITIES TO BE SILOED AND 

9866
05:12:33,767 --> 05:12:34,435
PRIVATE. 

9867
05:12:34,435 --> 05:12:36,304
>> THEY DID BRING UP THE TALK 

9868
05:12:36,304 --> 05:12:37,672
ABOUT OVERSEAS, MUCH TOUGHER 

9869
05:12:37,672 --> 05:12:38,605
RESTRICTIONS ABOUT DELETING 

9870
05:12:38,605 --> 05:12:38,872
CONTENT. 

9871
05:12:38,872 --> 05:12:43,578
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT AND 

9872
05:12:43,578 --> 05:12:44,946
DO YOU THINK THAT IS SOMETHING 

9873
05:12:44,946 --> 05:12:45,846
LAWMAKERS ARE LOOKING AT? 

9874
05:12:45,846 --> 05:12:47,014
>> I THINK THE PLATFORM IS 

9875
05:12:47,014 --> 05:12:48,315
GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF 

9876
05:12:48,315 --> 05:12:50,852
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO ADDRESS 

9877
05:12:50,852 --> 05:12:52,520
GDPR IN EUROPE, SO WHAT COULD 

9878
05:12:52,520 --> 05:12:55,756
HAPPEN IS WHAT WE CALL 

9879
05:12:55,756 --> 05:12:56,524
HARMONIZATION. 

9880
05:12:56,524 --> 05:12:58,125
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ENHANCING 

9881
05:12:58,125 --> 05:12:59,327
THIS PLATFORM SO THEY CAN PORT 

9882
05:12:59,327 --> 05:13:01,662
IT OVER HERE. 

9883
05:13:01,662 --> 05:13:02,997
WE COULD SEE SOME ALIGNMENT AND 

9884
05:13:02,997 --> 05:13:04,331
IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO START. 

9885
05:13:04,331 --> 05:13:05,499
EUROPE HAS BEEN LEADING THE 

9886
05:13:05,499 --> 05:13:08,269
WAY. 

9887
05:13:08,269 --> 05:13:09,370
WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE 

9888
05:13:09,370 --> 05:13:10,838
THAT OUR POLITICIANS ARE MORE 

9889
05:13:10,838 --> 05:13:14,008
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN A 

9890
05:13:14,008 --> 05:13:15,242
LOT OF THE GENERAL POPULACE. 

9891
05:13:15,242 --> 05:13:15,910
YOU CAN'T RUN A MODERN 

9892
05:13:15,910 --> 05:13:16,911
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN WITHOUT 

9893
05:13:16,911 --> 05:13:17,244
SOCIAL MEDIA. 

9894
05:13:17,244 --> 05:13:20,448
SO THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE 

9895
05:13:20,448 --> 05:13:21,816
OF A CLUE THAN MOST PEOPLE, SO 

9896
05:13:21,816 --> 05:13:23,350
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I 

9897
05:13:23,350 --> 05:13:25,887
THINK -- I THINK SOME OF THEIR 

9898
05:13:25,887 --> 05:13:26,654
QUESTIONING WAS PRETTY GOOD 

9899
05:13:26,654 --> 05:13:27,788
TODAY AND STRATEGIC. 

9900
05:13:27,788 --> 05:13:34,028
>> ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 

9901
05:13:34,028 --> 05:13:35,396
STOOD OUT TO ME, AND ROGER, 

9902
05:13:35,396 --> 05:13:36,764
FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN, DICK 

9903
05:13:36,764 --> 05:13:37,899
DURBIN ASKING ABOUT PRIVACY AND 

9904
05:13:37,899 --> 05:13:39,033
HE HAD THE QUESTION THAT KIND 

9905
05:13:39,033 --> 05:13:40,635
OF -- YOU HEARD SILENCE IN THE 

9906
05:13:40,635 --> 05:13:41,769
ROOM, WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE 

9907
05:13:41,769 --> 05:13:42,670
TELLING US WHICH HOTEL YOU 

9908
05:13:42,670 --> 05:13:43,537
STAYED IN LAST NIGHT? 

9909
05:13:43,537 --> 05:13:44,672
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT? 

9910
05:13:44,672 --> 05:13:46,274
>> THAT WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE 

9911
05:13:46,274 --> 05:13:50,578
OF SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO 

9912
05:13:50,578 --> 05:13:51,712
BE TECHNICALLY SAVVY BUT GOT 

9913
05:13:51,712 --> 05:13:52,913
THE ANSWER THAT GOT TO THE 

9914
05:13:52,913 --> 05:13:53,114
CORE. 

9915
05:13:53,114 --> 05:13:54,115
ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE LINE 

9916
05:13:54,115 --> 05:13:55,249
OF QUESTIONING, THE TRAP THAT 

9917
05:13:55,249 --> 05:13:56,584
WAS SET FOR MARK ZUCKERBERG. 

9918
05:13:56,584 --> 05:14:00,521
AND IT SHOWS THAT WE DON'T NEED 

9919
05:14:00,521 --> 05:14:01,989
TO BE TECHNICALLY SAVVY TO 

9920
05:14:01,989 --> 05:14:07,361
UNDERSTAND, BUT THE PRIVACY 

9921
05:14:07,361 --> 05:14:08,496
ISSUE IS DEFINITEY FRONT AND 

9922
05:14:08,496 --> 05:14:08,729
CENTER. 

9923
05:14:08,729 --> 05:14:10,064
>> THERE WAS A BIG PAUSE FROM 

9924

MARK ZUCKERBERG BEFORE HE 

9925
05:14:11,032 --> 05:14:11,399
ANSWERED THAT. 

9926
05:14:11,399 --> 05:14:12,600
THAT WAS THE TIME HE REALLY -- 

9927
05:14:12,600 --> 05:14:13,667
THE FIRST TIME HE REALLY 

9928
05:14:13,667 --> 05:14:14,001
PAUSED. 

9929

LAUGHING ABOUT THE INITIAL

-- JUST STONEFACED AT THAT 

9936
05:14:28,582 --> 05:14:28,815

THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY CORRELATE 

9951
05:14:56,177 --> 05:14:58,879

PEOPLE CAN OPT OUT OF. 

9958
05:15:11,024 --> 05:15:15,963
