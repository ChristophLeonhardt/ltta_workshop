1
00:00:01,493 --> 00:00:03,327
THEM.

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,995
AINSLEY: IN A NEW OP-ED

3
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:05,663
REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE

4
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:06,930
IS SPEAKING OUT CALLING

5
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:07,965
THEIR BEHAVIOR A DIRECT

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,668
THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

7
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:11,301
BRIAN: STEVE SCALISE JOINS

8
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,905
US NOW.

9
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:16,440
CONGRESSMAN, IT'S AS IF THEY

10
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:17,141
FORGOT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

11
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,275
YOU WERE BLEEDING TO DEATH

12
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:20,611
AT SECOND BASE BECAUSE OF

13
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:21,378
BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER

14
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:23,080
THOUGHT HE HAD TO KILL

15
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:23,480
REPUBLICANS.

16
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,882
DO THEY UNDERSTANDING THAT

17
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:26,250
THESE DERANGED PEOPLE JUST

18
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,686
NEED A GO SIGN AND THEIR

19
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:31,355
AGGRESSION COULD BE THE

20
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:31,822
TRIGGER?

21
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,457
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE

22
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,358
SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THIS

23
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,125
FROM THE LEFT.

24
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:37,394
AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR

25
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:37,661
IT.

26
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,896
WHAT I WROTE ABOUT IS THAT

27
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:40,464
WHEN YOU SEE THESE KINDS OF

28
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:44,134
THINGS BEING SAID, T. IS

29
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:45,202
INCITING PEOPLE AND FRANKLY

30
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:46,336
NOT THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD

31
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,738
BE GOING AND NOT WHAT OUR

32
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:48,639
COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT.

33
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,807
WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY THAT

34
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,241
CELEBRATES THE FACT WE CAN

35
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,076
ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH EACH

36
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:52,443
OTHER.

37
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:53,877
WE CAN DISAGREE WITH OUR

38
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:54,278
GOVERNMENT.

39
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:55,412
BUT THERE IS A WAY TO

40
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:56,914
RESOLVE IT YOU RESOLVE YOUR

41
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:57,715
DIFFERENCES AT THE BALLOT

42
00:00:57,716 --> 00:00:58,048
BOX.

43
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,783
YOU DON'T RESORT TO

44
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:00,150
VIOLENCE.

45
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:01,985
AND TO SEE LEADERS CALLING

46
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:03,854
ON VIOLENCE, THAT HAPPENS IN

47
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,122
THIRD WORLD NATIONS.

48
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,091
NOT IN AMERICA.

49
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:07,725
AINSLEY: CONGRESSMAN, WHY

50
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:08,659
DID YOU DECIDE TO WRITE THE

51
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,326
OP-ED?

52
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,694
>> WELL, I'M CONCERNED THAT

53
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,795
YOU ARE SEEING AN INCREASE

54
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:12,596
OF THIS.

55
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:14,598
YOU KNOW, LOOK, I WOULD LIKE

56
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,266
TO SEE LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES

57
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:17,201
CALLING IT OUT.

58
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,569
YOU ARE SEEING LEADERS ON

59
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,570
THE RIGHT CALLING IT OUT.

60
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:20,804
YOU ARE NOT SEEING ANY

61
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:21,805
LEADERS ON THE LEFT CALLING

62
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:22,139
IT OUT.

63
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,474
IN FACT, YOU ARE SEEING SOME

64
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:25,309
OF THE LEADERS ON THE LEFT

65
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,376
INCITING MORE VIOLENCE.

66
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,644
CALLING ON MORE VIOLENCE

67
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:28,712
INSTEAD OF SAYING THERE IS

68
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,780
NO PLACE FOR IT.

69
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:32,149
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

70
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,250
MAINSTREAM MEDIA ASKING BOTH

71
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,251
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT

72
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:35,886
LEADERS TO STAND UP AGAINST

73
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,187
THIS KIND OF RHETORIC.

74
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:39,423
THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE.

75
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,125
STEVE: CONGRESSMAN SCALISE,

76
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:42,392
MAXINE WATERS JUST WORKS

77
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,761
ACROSS THE HALL FROM YOU IN

78
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:44,728
A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

79
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,263
YOU ARE WORKING IN THE SAME

80
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:46,630
BUILDING.

81
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:47,297
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT GOING

82
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:49,066
OVER TO HER OFFICE AND

83
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,234
SAYING WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

84
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:50,534
ABOUT?

85
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,138
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

86
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,805
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE TALKED

87
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:55,873
TO SOME DEMOCRATS ABOUT

88
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,174
THIS, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

89
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:57,875
DEMOCRATS THAT ARE CONCERNED

90
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:58,609
ABOUT IT.

91
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,810
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SOME OF

92
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:01,078
THEM SPEAKING OUT PUBLICLY

93
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,346
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT

94
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,714
IT IS GOING TO TAKE.

95
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:04,481
STEVE: WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK

96
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,150
TO HER DIRECTLY, SIR?

97
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,684
>> WELL, I HAVE SPOKEN TO A

98
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:08,752
NUMBER OF THEM DIRECTLY.

99
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,586
AND I THINK THE ONES I HAVE

100
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,523
SPOKEN TO, YOU KNOW, SOME OF

101
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:13,857
THEM GET IT SOME OF THEM

102
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:14,158
DON'T.

103
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,392
BUT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE GOT

104
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:16,894
TO KEEP SHINING A LIGHT ON

105
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:18,362
THIS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

106
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,730
THIS ISN'T WHAT POLITICS IS

107
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:20,597
ABOUT IN AMERICA.

108
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,598
IT'S NOT WHAT THE FOUNDING

109
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,167
OF OUR COUNTRY WAS ABOUT.

110
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:25,135
IT WAS ABOUT FREE SPEECH,

111
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:26,270
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.

112
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,404
NOT VIOLENCE AGAINST

113
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:28,038
ANYBODY.

114
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,740
AND, YOU KNOW, MARGARET

115
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:30,741
THATCHER USED TO SAY FIRST

116
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:32,042
YOU WIN THE ARGUMENT.

117
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,076
THEN YOU WIN THE VOTE.

118
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,511
THEY ARE NOT WINNING THE

119
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:35,579
ARGUMENT IF THEY ARE

120
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,880
RESORTING TO VIOLENCE.

121
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,714
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL LOSE

122
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,183
THE VOTE IF THEY CONTINUE TO

123
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:40,350
CALL ON VIOLENCE.

124
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,485
LOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

125
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:42,619
WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET

126
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,887
THIS ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK.

127
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,155
PEOPLE LIKE THE DIRECTION OF

128
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:45,756
THE COUNTRY.

129
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:46,557
THEY DON'T LIKE THE

130
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,559
DIRECTION THAT WE ARE

131
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,892
HEADED.

132
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,294
THEY GO OUT AND TRY TO LAY

133
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,862
OUT A BETTER COURSE AND

134
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:52,296
BETTER AGENDA.

135
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,330
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY ARE

136
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,398
TRYING TO DO ON THE LEFT.

137
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,799
THEY ARE TRYING TO THREATEN

138
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
AND INTIMIDATE PEOPLE.

139
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,168
THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICA IS

140
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:58,468
ABOUT.

141
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,570
>> CONGRESSMAN, I GET THE

142
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:00,704
SENSE WHEN I WATCH NOPTION

143
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:02,206
THAT SHE FEELS LIKE SHE IS

144
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:03,040
SPEAKER ALREADY.

145
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,974
DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S DONE

146
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,077
THAT YOU SHOULD GET MINORITY

147
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:08,178
OR DO YOU FEEL THERE IS MORE

148
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,646
TIME ON THE CLOCK LEFT WITH

149
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,348
THREE AND A HALF WEEKS?

150
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,718
>> INTEREST IS A

151
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:14,751
WE INTEREST IS A

152
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:14,785
WEEKNTEREST IS A

153
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,018
WEEKS?EREST IS A

154
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,720
>> THERE IS A LOT MORE GAME

155
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:17,754
LEFT TO BE PLAYED.

156
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,890
YOU FEEL A LOT OF MOMENTUM

157
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:20,490
OUR WAY.

158
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,892
PEOPLE WERE ANGERED BY WHAT

159
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,093
THEY SAW IN THE SENATE THE

160
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:23,861
LAST FEW WEEKS.

161
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:25,128
AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU TALK TO

162
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,196
THEM ABOUT THE ECONOMY, THEY

163
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:27,497
LIKE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING.

164
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,432
PEOPLE ARE WORKING.

165
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:29,600
THEY ARE GETTING HIGHER

166
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:30,767
WAGES NOW BECAUSE OF THE

167
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:32,135
WORK WE DID WITH PRESIDENT

168
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,570
TRUMP TO CUT TAXES.

169
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,738
YOU ARE SEEING AN ECONOMY

170
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:35,806
THAT'S BOOMING.

171
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:37,074
AND, YET, DEMOCRATS WANT TO

172
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:37,875
RAISE TAXES.

173
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:39,776
THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH ICE.

174
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:42,246
THEY HAVE GOT A VERY LEFTIST

175
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:42,913
AGENDA THAT'S OUT OF TOUCH

176
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:43,747
WITH THE PEOPLE I'M TALKING

177
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:45,849
TO WHEN I GO TO SWING

178
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,283
DISTRICTS.

179
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:47,217
BRIAN: YOU DON'T THINK IT'S

180
00:03:47,218 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER.
