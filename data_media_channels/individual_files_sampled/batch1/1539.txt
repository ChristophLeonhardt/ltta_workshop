the parting shot to Myanmar's leader from a veteran US diplomat bill Richardson says own song suit she lacks moral leadership and resigns from an international advisory panel of the roar hinge of crisis while they bicker what about the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim Jim frustration over me and Mars handling of the row hinge a crisis has boiled over into an argument between on song Sookie and her friend now critic bill Richardson the former US ambassador to the UN resigned from an advisory panel set up by the government after accusing it of trying to whitewash the crisis and in his resignation letter Richardson accused members of being a cheerleading squad for the government Richardson was then accused by the government of having his own agenda his criticisms raise further doubts about a deal to repatriate nearly 700,000 row Hindu refugees stuck in Bangladesh Scot Heidler has more from Yangon if you listen to government leaders in Myanmar this week was supposed to see a trickle of her Hindi refugees returning to these new repatriation centers in Rakhine State they said from Tuesday the centers were open and ready to receive but the other country in this equation Bangladesh said incomplete paperwork for the refugees is causing a delay no word on just how long some human rights groups think it's much more than paperwork the fundamental problem is that all these operations and setup these plans have been devised these negotiations have been done leaving the refugees outside the door and they haven't been consulted they haven't been talked to and many of the refugees are simply too afraid to go back anywhere near the Burmese military also this week the launch of a new Commission to follow up from a group headed by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as members both from Myanmar and abroad are supposed to implement recommendations and advice on the hinge of crisis but even before their first trip to reclined the highest profile member bill Richardson resigned the former US diplomat described as a friend of leader unsung Suki abruptly left after a heated exchange on her part Richardson said that he left the Commission because it was a whitewash and that unsung SUCI lacked moral leadership while government officials said that they dismissed him because he was here only to pursue his own agenda a remaining member of the Commission rebuff to Richardson's resignation saying the Myanmar government is both series and listening to the Commission well obviously he didn't check with us before he made that statement and I think it's very unfortunate he didn't join most of our proceedings since two days ago and in any case it was not the intention of the advisory board to make final conclusions this week one member of the Kofi Anan commission from Myanmar gave us his view of Richardson's departure and the need for better transparency he's a man to be reckoned with I think this is a little bit of a drawback but we can move on we should take criticism and if there is anything that we need to correct we should do that and if there is nothing wrong we should prove it by facts and figures and in order to do that the basic fact is that you need people to go to that area but that hasn't happened recline remains heavily controlled by the military humanitarian groups the UN and media are still not allowed free access to recline so refugees hoping to return have to rely on limited information to make very important decisions got Heidler al Jazeera Yangon I reported from Bangladesh in October and every day my camera team and I encountered people who suffered some of the worst abuses we as journalists have ever come across we were told of atrocities including mass killings gang rapes and the raising of entire villages one thing we heard from every single refugee we spoke with was an overwhelming fear of what would happen to them if they returned to me and more and that's the subject of a recent film by fortify rights and another no matter the hallucinogen I gave you as on over at are irregular re-engineered again let's bring in our guests and kuala lumpur is tuned in he is the president of the burmese or hindu organization in the united kingdom and a leading voice for ro hinges in exile Matthew Smith is the CEO of the Southeast Asia human rights group fortify rights and finally joining us from Geneva Switzerland is Phil Robertson who you just saw in Scott's piece he is the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division welcome to you all Matthew I want to start with you we saw those clips from the film that fortify rights produced tell us about what are the ins and outs of this repatriation deal there have been so many questions far more questions than answers are there any more indications that we know what the nuts and bolts of this deal might actually be well we know that Bangladesh has a enormous refugee population and desires to rid itself of that population we know that the Myanmar authorities have constructed basically what amounts to internment camps on the Myanmar side of the border to receive refugees but we also know that refugees are very reticent even scared as you mentioned to go back to their homeland but apart from that the the Bangladesh authorities have essentially said that there are logistical kinks they're trying to work out in our view and what we're seeing on the ground refugees are not lining up to participate in this process fill criticism of Aung San su Chi has been growing in the international community for months does this very damning statement by Bill Richardson after his resignation does that put a sufficient amount of pressure on Ansan Suchi now that it would change anything in any way would at some point we expect to see her actually denouncing the actions of the military I think it's a wake-up call for the diplomatic Kimmy and the UN representatives in Myanmar who have been cheerleading also for Ong song Sochi who have been claiming that you know any criticism of her ultimately will play to the benefit of the military quite clearly this is a military that is not afraid of accountability it's not expecting to be held accountable and Suchi has essentially become a an element in the cover-up that's what's really being said here that's what was revealed that you know she doesn't want to know what actually happened and if she did know she didn't want to do anything about it but I don't think that bill Richardson's actual criticism will be enough to actually turn the tables I think that su Chi is now looking to the other members of the Commission to support her and to sort of push aside criticism from Richardson and I think that you know she is hoping that these people will be willing to go along with her version of reality the really sad part of this is that the chair of this commission dr. su Sura Kiat satya defy from thailand you know it doesn't seem to be exercising the kind of leadership that we saw from Kofi Annan he is clearly in a different league and it appears that he is prepared to go along with the version of events that su Chi and the military have been presenting to them soon can the reh√©n sure had their citizenship withdrawn in what was then Burma thirty five years ago the Myanmar government considers them illegal immigrants what is their status currently in Bangladesh you know yes they're being is a step to step they are trying to get a read of looking at population you know that's what when we talk about Rohingya issue is systematically persecution and systematically they are driven out and is a genocide what suffering to the Rohingya that's what we can see what we can see here Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh I don't think they will return to Burma as the way the situation what if they have default in Burma that is one thing we need to look at you know the situation in Bangladesh in Fiji campuses are really bad so what we need to see now is into what international community what they have to do as we have seen also whitewash this commission what they trying to do this is quite critical time for us that's what I can say Matthew you just heard turn can use the word genocide now in December UN Human Rights chief Xia Drogheda say and address the Human Rights Council session in Geneva and he said that an act of genocide against for Indian Muslims by state forces and Myanmar cannot be ruled out now that was definitely a change because four months before that we kept hearing the term ethnic cleansing being utilized by UN officials and by rights groups and by international governments so does the fact that the UN Human Rights chief utilized the word genocide change things sufficiently do you expect that more groups now that more officials might be utilizing that word and raising the alarm bells well I think the policy options that governments have are present whether or not the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invoking the term genocide we put out a report with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in November that it was a year-long investigation that found mounting evidence of the crime of genocide against Roja in Rakhine State and there have been other reports and studies the state crime initiative there was also a report by a team from Yale Law School that had legal findings pointing towards genocide this has been going on for a very long time I think certainly the High Commissioners remarks would wake would wake some people up it's not enough there definitely needs to be a bigger there needs to be a sea change among the diplomatic community among the international community and right now Myanmar's military leaders and other state security officials in the country are getting away with these crimes some of the worst crimes that can be perpetrated are being perpetrated with complete impunity and that needs to change Phil rights groups have been calling for a while now on the UN Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court in The Hague but Myanmar is not a signatory to the Rome treaty so even if the UN Security Council were to refer Myanmar to the ICC would that make any difference well it would make a difference because actually that referral from the UN Security Council is the only way you can get a non ratifying state like Burma to the ICC we have been calling for this all along we've demanded that there be international criminal justice in this case because it's quite clear that both the Myanmar military and the civilian government are more inclined to cover things up then actually prosecute individuals who are responsible for these atrocities but we think that the Security Council shouldn't just stop there where we've been calling for a global embargo on arms to the Burmese military and we're also calling for targeted sanctions to be put on specific individuals who are determined to have played a leading role in the atrocities and the crimes against humanity against the Rohingya I think that you know people don't have to wait for the UN Security Council on those kind of targeted sanctions the EU should be taking them up the United States should do more and other countries should join that movement and putting pressure on the Burmese government and military by identifying and targeting the individuals most culpable for those those crimes Tony can we hear criticism all the time that that the international community is simply not doing enough to try to mitigate in this crisis what more in the international community can the UN can governments do to try to help I think we need to look at what's happening to the Rohingya is genocide for many years going on what we have seen in after up to August 25th is a clear we have seen UN Security Council discussed two times and we have seen about 20 years UN General Assembly resolution UN Human Rights Council resolution since 1990 over so how many years more you Europeans need to need to be faced this genocidal acts from Burmese military and the government's you know let me bring you one thing you know like when I was young like when I was born like 1980s this is the time when you know the big episode has happened to Roe Hingis you know the first time and after they finger 250000 pushback from validate they introduced 82 citizenship law rowena become stateless in their own state so the way we look and at is international community have to look at Burmese people including military and current NLD government there is no willingness to solve the issue there is no clear you know attitude to restore their rights so what we need is this time is we need our international protection any mechanism to protect these people inside Burma same time this Rohingya 650 thousand they will not return until the policy not change to change this policy UN Security Council and other international communities must come forward collectively to protect them Mathew you heard tucks and speaking very passionately there about the fact that there needs to be a mechanism by which the safety and security of her hinder refugees can be guaranteed once they might return to me and mark now from your point of view are there any indications that basic conditions in Myanmar that made the row hinges so vulnerable to decades of persecution and violence inside of me and more have changed at all unfortunately not Muhammad the the situation in northern recline state actually the situation throughout all over kind state in still involves systemic human rights violations against the revenge' population as well as other Muslim populations in Rakhine State there are severe restrictions on freedom of movement even restrictions on repairing one's home and other daily activities so until that that fundamental until that architecture of abuse is changed it really makes very little sense and it would be it would be quite dangerous in fact for a large refugee population to go back to these areas and frankly I think Myanmar right now is trying to communicate to the international community that it's that it's seeking solutions and trying to do the right thing they're doing that without actually making fundamental changes on the ground and and that's that's one of the the biggest problems right now and we're kind stayed Phil what are some of the concrete steps that need to be taken in order to be able to craft a repatriation deal that might have the potential to work well first and foremost talk to the RO hinga I mean this was an agreement that was done between Myanmar and Bangladesh without the involvement of the people concerned the RO Inga were completely left out of this discussion there was no conversation between them and policymakers on why they would go back what guarantees they had what protections they insisted on none of this I mean the only way that the RO hanga have been able to communicate their concerns is by protests in the camps which we saw earlier this week so you know if we look at the fundamental problem of this agreement the RO hinga are not part of it the other part is that the UN refugee agency UNHCR is not part of it Bangladesh has said that they will have UNHCR involved on the Bangladesh side of the border but on the Myanmar side of the border the agreement says that UNHCR will only be involved as appropriate that means that the government of Myanmar has an expected veto over any participation or any monitoring of returns by UNHCR to northern reclined state that's simply not acceptable without the UN refugee agency there is an equal partner and able to say look you know the situation is not ready for these people to go back they're not protected then you know this this this agreement is not going to function it's not going to work you know the RO hanga are talking about you know we need UN peacekeepers in northern reclines state that's not going to happen but you know it gives you an idea of the gap where Myanmar saying everything is ready they can go back now and the Roja saying we're not going to go back without peacekeepers you know that that shows that basically there is no agreement and as long as the people in those camps are not prepared to go back nothing is going to move on the ground tone can speaking of the humanitarian impact of all this have conditions in camps like kuttappa long and other camps and Cox's Bazar and parts of Bangladesh improved at all of late for the religious population I do think at all but we appreciate what so far international community help you know communitarian aid we really appreciate Bangladesh government and the public theater but it cannot go a long way me how you know it's not it's a 700,000 Rohingya this is quite a large amount we need to look at how we can how we can press mode to Burmese military and this and all the government because we have not seen that attitude towards Rohingya from military from an energy from Dhaka City there is nothing change you have we have seen many example of this this is the last one what we have seen from former diplomat you know US diplomat Bill Richardson so this is that's why I my focus is while we can bring ICC how we can get a stronger you know resolution from UNSC or how we can provide protection you know so this is what we need to collectively advocate for this issue continuously and I think you know it is important that without protection here safety security and protection without that there is no way to return and you know ruin has been living giant prison for more than for 35 years so how can how they will go go go go back where they they have to pass through three two to four checkpoints even a presence when she wants to give a path this is the situation there so we need to build the situation we need to see what's happened to them so this is what internship I'm sorry already interrupt you right just that we're running out of time and I just want to pick up on something you mentioned there about the rajendra that have been living for decades already in Bangladesh and I wanted to ask Matthew when I was in Cox's Bazar I spoke to many Roja refugees that had been there since the 90s they were saying that they were very familiar with anti Rohan just sentiment and that they felt that resentment against them was deepening since this past August and the latest Exodus now could you speak about that what is the feeling toward them from what you've observed on the ground in places like Cox's Bazar well we've seen some very positive behavior from state security officials from Bangladesh border guards over the last year to protect the refugee population coming in it's important to mention though that that could change in an instant and as soon as word comes down from Dhaka we may start to see the authorities effectively coercing people back to Myanmar or as they've done in the past force refugees back into Myanmar but in terms of the local Bangladeshi population there are there are certainly tensions you know this is this is an enormous influx now there are more than a million Rohingya in this part among adesh and and there are certainly tensions with the the local communities the local Bangladeshi communities there are also local Bangladeshis who are their businesses have have improved dramatically over the last several months so there there are a whole variety of experiences right now I think what needs to happen is Bangladesh needs to be pressured to ensure the protection of the refugee populations and to ensure that that refugees are not forced out of the situation forced back into me and more and Phil picking up also on what Matthew was just saying if we're talking about you know Bangladesh ensuring the protection of this refugee population we must also speak about the physical conditions on the ground in those camps when I was in Cox's Bazar the conditions were appalling these tents made of bamboo and tarp and the question was what happens when monsoon season starts again many of these tents are built on hillsides when the rain comes there's a real concern now they could be washed away can you tell us about your fears of what might happen to the RO Hinda who were already there and they were injured that keep fleeing me and more in the camps with conditions being as they are well you raise a good point because this this area really is in the monsoon Belt both for Rakhine State and for Bangladesh you know we've been concerned not only for the the groups and koota belong in other places in Bangladesh but also for the internally displaced persons 120 or so thousand that are still in the areas west of sittwe in central rakhine state that all you need is one typhoon with a direct hit on that area and you're gonna be dealing with a disaster because there's nothing to protect those people from severe weather you know I think that the international community is certainly focused on these kind of issues humanitarians are trying to come up with solutions people recognize the vulnerability of the environment there and I think that from the first weeks of the crisis to now I there's been a real improvement in the humanitarian agencies capacity to come up with solutions and and try to sort out ways to ensure that the safety of the RO hanga is maintained no matter what sort of weather hits that area but in central rakhine state where there's this mass group of IDPs everybody has forgotten about them these are the people who are displaced in 2012 when there was also crimes against humanity in June and October of that year that drove everyone out of sittwe the the you know a city that was used to be 50 percent Muslim and 50 percent Buddhist is now completely reclined Buddhists because all the RO hanga have been driven out these people also need to be cared for and those people are also being facing restrictions on because they're the humanitarian agencies have difficult to access these areas and you know when we talk about what the RO hinga from Bangladesh would be going back to it's probably something like these IDP camps which are essentially open-air internment camps and all these risk factors you've raised about monsoon about diseases about lack of security all those things apply in both Bangladesh camps and also these IDP camps gentlemen we're gonna have to leave it there thanks to all our guests ton kin Matthew Smith and Phil Robertson and thank you
