1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,370
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has
taken over about a third of Iraq. They're

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,190
called ISIS for short, but it's easier to
understand what they are if you know them

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,309
by their old name, al-Qaeda in Iraq. They
were a key part of the insurgency after America's

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,750
2003 invasion toppled Saddam Hussein. And
at the time, they had a lot of support from

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,480
the country's minority Sunnis. They held a
lot of territory because Sunnis were furious,

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,980
both at the Americans who had kicked Saddam
Hussein out of power, and the Shias who had

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,590
taken over the government. But al-Qaeda in
Iraq had big ambitions. They didn't just want

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,839
to kick America out. They wanted to set up
an Islamic state. So they banned music, and

9
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:42,179
they banned smoking. Women couldn't show their
hair and they began beheading civilians who

10
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,620
disobeyed their rules. Starting in 2006, their
brutality lost them the support of Iraqi Sunnis,

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,979
who partnered with US forces to help push
al-Qaeda in Iraq out of the country. America

12
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,589
takes a lot of credit for this. We call it
the surge. We're very proud of it and we should

13
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,399
be, but the big thing we did in the surge
was we helped the Sunnis, Sons of Iraq, as

14
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,440
they called themselves, rise up against al-Qaeda
in Iraq's savage theocratic rule. So al-Qaeda

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,350
in Iraq was defeated, but they weren't destroyed.
They were driven out of much of the territory

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,329
they used to control, and then they began
rebuilding. In particular, they became heavily

17
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:18,229
involved in the fighting in Syria. They were
trying to overthrow the Shiite Assad regime.

18
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:24,299
Their tactics in Syria were so brutal and
their ambitions were so grand that al-Qaeda

19
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,229
itself actually cut ties with them. Al-Qaeda
thought al-Qaeda in Iraq was bad for the al-Qaeda

20
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,280
brand. After their split with al-Qaeda in
February 2014, they renamed themselves ISIS

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,549
and they began setting up extortion rackets
from Syria. They took over part of the oil

22
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,549
industry. They sold electricity back to the
Syrian government that they were fighting. Meanwhile

23
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,270
in Iraq, Prime Minister Malaki had been ruling
on sectarian lines. Maliki is a Shiite and

24
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,109
he was empowering Shias. He was violently
breaking up Sunni protests. He was arresting

25
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:59,219
Sunni politicians. So the minority Sunni population
began to hate him and fear him. So ISIS returned

26
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,359
to Iraq and they began selling themselves
as the Sunni champion against Maliki. And

27
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,810
they gradually grew strong -- strong enough
to challenge the Iraqi government in the country's

28
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,930
second-largest city, Mosul. So when 800 ISIS
soldiers challenged 30,000 Iraqi army troops

29
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,370
in the mostly-Sunni city, the Iraqi troops,
most of them, they put down their arms and

30
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,489
ran. This was a group that was largely Sunni.
They simply refused to fight and die for a

31
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:27,290
Shiite government that they didn't think cared
for them. That ultimately is where ISIS's

32
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,870
real power comes from. They get weapons and
they get money from the territory they control

33
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,360
and they have skilled fighters, but they're
facing a government that's widely unpopular

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,060
among Sunnis. Only a tiny percentage of Sunnis
actively support ISIS's goals, but at least

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,480
for now they appear willing to let ISIS operate
in their territory freely because they see

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,110
it as an alternative to a Shiite government
they despise. But ISIS wants do to much more

37
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,780
than that. They want to set up a new state
that reaches up into both Iraq and Syria,

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,659
one that governs according to a medieval interpretation
of Islamic law. And so Iraq's Sunni population

39
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:04,629
is caught between two terrible forces: A Shia
majority that violently represses them to

40
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,260
hold on to political power, and a theocratic
militia that will kill them 

41
00:03:09,260 --> 00:00:00,000
if they step too far into modernity.
