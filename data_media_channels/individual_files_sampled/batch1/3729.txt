is the stock market going to crash is this little bit of wavering that we've seen the last few weeks the start of a much bigger move Matthew The Economist recently said you know what stocks are overvalued we're going to see him come down so is this the start of that I think one of the things I've learned over the years the economist is though we're often right in our call it takes a long time for the call actually to affect what actually goes on the market so I don't know whether what's happening now is the start of that correction but the underlying messages that I think stocks look very expensive by you know all the sort of rules that historically we've used to judge them and I've written about a lot of bubbles over the years and I've been I think right in the end one of the reason we wrote the road from ruin was we want to learn from all these bubbles that do happen and we did have a lot of I had a lot of experience i remember back in the late 1990s when people were saying the Dow should be at 36,000 and The Economist was you know wrong to say there was a bubble then and I think what's happened now is that you've had you know the inevitable rebound from the credit crunch effect on the market and that's been good there should have been a bounce back in the stock market but fundamentally you know that then a lot of liquidity came into the system and I think people have just rode them and then rode the momentum anest led us to a point where the share prices do that very high at moment so if the economist in you are right about this what are we looking at we're looking at a garden-variety ten to twenty percent pullback we looking at a catastrophic collapse to new lows I mean I don't think that there's any reason why it should go anywhere near where the lows were in this crisis because that was due to a lot of very artificial forces affecting the market due to the crisis and the way the everyone panicked so you know I don't think we're going to look at that kind of return to to where we were but i think we are you know we're either going to see things just be very flat and do go nowhere for several years or we're going to see a correction that term you know gets you better position which does make more sense it often though it seems that the market just tends to sort of fade out and Plateau especially after bubbles like yes certainly if you look in 1973-74 it's exactly what we saw exactly Japan is Benjamin classically so so I wake up this morning and I see Goldman Sachs kindly telling me not to worry about stock prices because in fact they're cheap because interest rates are low and it's only 18 times forward operating earnings why have you concluded that stocks are expensive well one of the fundamental worries that we have is that so much is going on in the capital markets at the moment is the result of this attempt to a successful attempt to stop the financial markets collapsing completely in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers so governments around the world have pumped so much money into the system to support the banks that that they can't keep on pumping in and so at some point something's gotta give and you know a lot of that money was supposed to go to actually ultimately benefit the real economy through lending but in fact has ended up going into speculation particular our commodities but also stock prices and if governments are running out of capacity to borrow and pump money into the financial system and so at some point the money is going to have to come out of the system again and that fundamentally is when we think the bubble will burst
