1
00:00:00,565 --> 00:00:01,440
“I’m Damien Chazelle.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,010
I’m the director
of “First Man.”

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,490
In this scene is
Neil Armstrong

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,370
played by Ryan Gosling
with Janet Armstrong played

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,952
by Claire Foy sitting
down with their kids,

6
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:13,410
basically explaining
to them what’s

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,450
about to happen on
the eve of Neil’s

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,610
departure for the famous
mission to the moon.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,100
And the idea for this
scene came from time

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
that Ryan and Josh
Singer the screenwriter

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,870
and I spent with Janet
and with Rick and Mark —

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,540
these two kids — of
course, now grown up —

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,800
recollecting this moment.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,650
Janet had to convince Neil
to sit down with his kids

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,650
before he left and actually
explain to them, not

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,150
just what he was
doing, but the fact

17
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,857
that he might not come back.

18
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,190
At this point in
the movie, this

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,120
is a family that’s been slowly
chipped away at in many ways

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,420
by the pressures and the
needs of the NASA program

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,650
and the mission to the moon.

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,110
And so this kind
of forced assembly

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,750
of the family, this almost
formal alignment of them

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,472
at this table, where
everyone is kind of

25
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,680
forced to look at each other,
that’s kind of dictated

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,480
the look and feel
of the scene for me

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,744
and Linus Sandgren, the DP,
at a time in the movie where

28
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,160
there’s a lot of
movement, there’s

29
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,660
a lot of forward momentum.

30
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,710
We’ve seen missions.

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,420
We’ve seen training
maneuvers go wrong.

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,650
We’ve seen action set pieces.

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,840
We’ve seen deaths.

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,460
It felt like here was a moment
for the movie to actually

35
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,040
just grind to a halt
for these few minutes

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,510
and just exist in more or less
static shots of these four

37
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,240
faces at this table,
this kind of quadrangle

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,860
of people who have
to basically stare

39
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,386
each other down.”

40
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,010
“Does anyone have
any other questions?”

41
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:35,795
“Do you think
you’re coming back?”

42
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,100
“We have a real
confidence in the mission.

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,290
And, ah, there are some risks,
but we have every intention

44
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,385
of coming back.”

45
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,030
“But you might not.”

46
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,440
“And Neil, at the center of
it, who is not going to be

47
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,270
let off the hook.

48
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,020
Janet is going to
make sure that he

49
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,630
tells the cold hard
truth to his boys.”

50
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,287
“That’s right.”

51
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,370
“And something that Ryan
and I talked a lot about,

52
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,170
and Ryan really sort
of had a huge hand

53
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,607
in shaping the
scene and finding

54
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,690
different ways to play it.

55
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,169
And Claire Foy who plays
Janet was very much the same.

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,920
One thing we all talked
about was the fact

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,890
that Neil is someone who
somehow seemed to not

58
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,860
be overly scared by the
idea of strapping himself

59
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,870
to a missile and blasting
through the atmosphere

60
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,400
and blasting into
the void of space

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,191
and going further
physically from the Earth

62
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,850
than any human
being in history.

63
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,470
But this is something
that scares him,

64
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,300
the idea that the one
thing that can really

65
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,050
scare Neil Armstrong is
this kind of conversation

66
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,440
on the eve of a mission, this
enormous and this important,

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,150
to actually sit
down and confront

68
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,540
his children about the fact
that he may not return.

69
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,670
That that would
actually be in many ways

70
00:02:42,670 --> 00:00:00,000
the hardest mission of all.”
