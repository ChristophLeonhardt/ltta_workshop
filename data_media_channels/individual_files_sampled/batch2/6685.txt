Allisyn actually want to talk about your marijuana ad first okay so this was what about two weeks ago that you released ad yeah I think so towards the end of April towards anime probably maybe yeah yeah and and it was about comparing Diane Feinstein's record to to Jeff Sessions right so we're gonna run that out for you in a second but what I want you to know what's really amazing and interesting is that right after Alison released that ad less than a week later Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden after fifty years in politics decided why legal marijuana maybe not so bad maybe not so bad and so look Allison's campaigns are really important we're gonna talk about that but what's equally important is progressive pressure works get into the primaries pressure them all of a sudden I meant to be so what's the ad that broke fine signs back on marijuana this is it watch Diane Feinstein has the same position on marijuana as Jeff Sessions she's against research she's against legalization she's against criminal justice reform dianne feinstein's position has cost the freedom of millions of people in communities of color when I say I'm fighting for us I'm not just talking about people who look like me I'm talking about all of us I will represent the wishes of California voters unlike our current senator I'm Allison Hartson and I approve this message because you already voted on this issue and it's about time we have a senator who's on your side Allisyn that's awesome okay because you moved her I know she's 84 and it might even I don't even know she's actually gonna serve out her full term and I know that her move is not genuine we voted on it in California and she was against marijuana legalization but I actually want to ask you about something that was frustrating that happen afterwards instead of getting a congratulations from the media not in because they're not supposed to take a side but in terms of like wow you hit her and she moved within a week right it was clearly correlated like oh that's interesting what was the reaction the media had they didn't say anything about it of course you know they congratulated her basically for making that move 50 years congratulations yeah I mean that's their way of course of saying hey look you don't have to worry about voting for anybody else or a true progressive in the race because she is doing what you've been asking for and yeah you know that's obviously its strategic but the good thing is we know better now and we have social media we have all of the tactics and the strategies that we've been using that are showing that my campaign is absolutely working but yeah of course it's insanely frustrating yeah and so I think the part of the reason that Feinstein reacted to that ad and and look you can say hey I'm biased I'm clearly in favor of Allison's you campaign I'm a doctor yeah and I'm honest about it I'm honest about it but but I really putting on my whether you believe me or not putting on my political analysis hat for a second there is no coincidence that large where an opponent in a primary runs an ad and in a person who has not moved on that position for 50 years in politics the very next week goes you know what I mean just out of nowhere I just decided that I'm gonna change my position on that that was definitely because of your ad and then to me the most frustrating perhaps because I like them among the best was McClatchy news because a lot of the press cover that story almost none of a mention no literally none of a mention you or that they're like Oh fine sign congratulations changes positions changing with the times come on right please don't do that have some self-respect as a journalist okay no because who really writes like you should at least say hey she's in a primary she's feeling pressure and to be fair a lot of them did and McClatchy did McClatchy Newspapers in my opinion over the last 20 years that I've been covering politics has been among the best but in that case they're the writer I gotta be admit was lazy so they're like okay who's the corporate candidate against Feinstein Katie oh well Katie O has a pressure at all on this right no no and he hasn't he has not done anything to be outspoken on the fact that we need to legalize marijuana and why and how this affects our criminal justice system etc he has not been doing that he's been in the Senate for or he's been a state representative for 12 years he has not been a champion on that either it is clearly because what we have been doing with this campaign and we've written articles about it I you can find articles on my site about it we've we have contacted the press about it we sent out that video to the press we didn't just put it up on our social media so it's not like they can say that they haven't heard from us and that they aren't aware of us and to to the credit of the San Francisco Chronicle they did pick up one of my videos and I think it might have been that one and they actually did write something on it so so credit where credit's due yeah much but certainly nothing was said after she actually ended up changing her position one last quick thing about that McClatchy article you can talk out on my skin they're like oh she's in a fight against Katie I'll who by the way is not pulling well at all but why he's an establishment politician so they're like and they acknowledge the article Katie ah hasn't really done anything on this issue so that's curious what we're gonna give them credit anyway oh that's right I mean not only is the media not providing the necessary context or purposefully providing false context but you can also use the opportunity where she moves on marijuana to point out how pathetic and tiny of a move it is grateful like her big final evolution on marijuana is well I guess I don't think feds should come in and arrest the people of my state let's throw a party that's amazing well I guess you know game over marijuana is just one like now I guess just because she said that people who run these shops can use banks which they should be able to do the people who are in prison are gonna be released you know maybe working but we're giving reparations for the people who are unnecessarily locked up for so long like all of the other peripheral issues that we haven't yet tackled are fixed because she doesn't think the feds should come in and lock up California thank you and that is such a good point of why I'm so insanely sick and tired of the establishment and people running as quote-unquote progressives it's it's one thing to say that you support an issue or that you're not going to fight against an issue it's another thing to champion it and so just to take the stand sit like oh well we're not gonna let the feds come in and overturn our state's decision is not enough and so you know it's it you're right it's not a full flip on the issue itself but it's just said perfectly right to position herself to try and pull the progressive vote and guys does anybody think that Dianne Feinstein is going to first lead on any issue okay but secondly on this issue you think she's gonna be a champion hey guys you know what we should make sure marijuana is legal everywhere and I can't believe Obama didn't lift it from Schedule one drug oh Gore's done now so and I think the part of the reason she moved on that was not just because of marijuana but you put criminal justice reform into that and you mention how it oppresses minority communities I think that's what's stung and they're like ah no no there's a lot of minorities in California we do identity politics yeah so okay no no no Latinos and and and black people find signs on your side kind of maybe doesn't think Trump should be able to arrest you today kind of on your side okay so I think that's what let's say you were a senator what would you do on that issue on marijuana yeah absolutely take it off the schedule it should be completely legal and it has to be at the federal level so that the state the states who have overturned this and made it legal are protected as we also need to make sure that we release people from prison who are in there on these minor marijuana offenses as well so we have to take it that extra step I think that if you release a fall bad we might get to see her smoke a joint it's gonna require effort a pile help
