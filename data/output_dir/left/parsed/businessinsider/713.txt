I'm not freestyling too old I wrote you
a sonnet instead when senseless acts of
tragedy remind us that nothing here is
promised not one day
the show is proof that history remembers
we live through times when heat and fear
seems stronger we rise and fall and
light from dying embers remembrances
that hope and love lasts longer and love
is love is love is love love is love is
love is love to not become oppressive
guys I think that the same thing Elijah
tells her story that filled the world
with the music love and prizes thank you
so much
