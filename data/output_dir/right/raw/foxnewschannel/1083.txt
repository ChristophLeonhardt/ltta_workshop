1
00:00:01,128 --> 00:00:03,597
>> Shannon: WE SHOULD POINT

2
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:04,231

MORE INFORMATION FROM THE FBI

AND HOW IT USES INFORMANTS.

6
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:10,904
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH HOUSE

7
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:12,539
JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN BOB

CREATE A HAPPY WITH US.

10
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:14,474
I SAW THE ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY

11
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,411
THAT IN THE COMING DAYS, YOU'VE

12
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:19,246
SET A DATE FOR HEARING ON THE

00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:21,982
INVESTIGATION INTO

16
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,284
HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS.

17
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:24,985
THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTIGATING

18
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:27,154
GOING ON.

19
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,588
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO LEARN

20
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:29,756
FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

21
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:30,090
REPORT?

22
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,958
>> THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

23
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,593

00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:34,728
LONG TIME, WAS PROMISED EARLIER

25
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:36,563
IN THE AIR, APRIL, MAY.

26
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:38,165
WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL

27
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:40,267
FINALLY SEE IT, BECAUSE IT WILL

28
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,601
ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

29
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:44,004
HOW THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF

30
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:44,771
INVESTIGATION AND THE DEPARTMENT

31
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,338

32
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,374
INVESTIGATION INTO MATTERS

33
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,809
RELATED TO FORMER PRESIDENTIAL

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:49,543
CANDIDATE AND FORMER SECRETARY

35
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:52,846
OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON AND

36
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,781
CONTRAST THAT WITH HOW THEY

37
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:55,515
CONDUCTED THE INVESTIGATION AND

38
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,152
ARE CONTINUING TO CONDUCT THE

39
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:02,155
INVESTIGATION INTO THE SO-CALLED

40
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:02,923
TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION, ALLEGING

41
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:04,524
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE

42
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:06,726
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.

43
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:07,994
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT

44
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:09,596
TO SEE THIS BECAUSE, IN MY

45
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:12,766
OPINION, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM

46
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:16,570
THE STRZOK-PAGE TEXT AND OTHERS,

47
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,605
THEY HANDLE V'S TWO MAJOR

48
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:20,907
MATTERS, WE CAN'T GO INTO

49
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:22,342
ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

50
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,410
AND HAVE THE WORLD'S PREMIER

51
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,945
LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION

52
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:26,580
CONDUCTING THEMSELVES THAT WAY.

53
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,782
REFORMS ARE UNDERWAY, PERSONNEL

54
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:29,516
CHANGES, WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE

55
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:32,185
BOTTOM OF THE FACTS, AND THE

56
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:33,320
INSPECTOR GENERAL WILL HELP US

57
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,753
DO THAT.

58
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,422
>> Shannon: ARE YOU CONCERNED,

59
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,791
SOME LAWMAKERS ARE, AND THE

60
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,992
PRESIDENT CERTAINLY HAS, THIS

61
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:39,759
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT HAS

62
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,293
BEEN DELAYED.

63
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,962
WE KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

64
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:43,063
STAKEHOLDERS THEY GET TO SEE IT,

65
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:45,565
THEY HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO

66
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:46,032
COMMENT, AND THE

67
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:46,900
INSPECTOR GENERAL COULD MODIFY

68
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,501
THE REPORT.

69
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:48,401
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT OR DO

70
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,036
YOU THINK IT IS RUNNING AS

71
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:50,470
NORMAL COURSE?

72
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,239
>> THAT IS WHY WE WILL HOLD THE

73
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:52,572
HEARING.

74
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:55,275
WE'LL SEE THE REPORT, HAVE THE

75
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,777
OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE

76
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:58,445
INSPECTOR GENERAL, BOTH THE

77
00:01:58,445 --> 00:02:01,181
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND THE

78
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:02,149
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, WITH TREY

79
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,751
GOWDY CHAIRS, WE HOLD A JOINT

80
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,553
HEARING, AND WE'LL DELVE INTO

81
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:08,455
NOT ONLY WHAT IS IN THE REPORT,

82
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:09,756
AND A CLASSIFIED SETTING, AND

83
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,092
FOR THE PORTIONS THAT CAN BE

84
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:14,761
UNCLASSIFIED, AND A PUBLIC

85
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,663
SETTING, BUT ALSO ASK ABOUT THE

86
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:18,064
PROCESS AND ANY QUESTIONS WE

87
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:20,567
HAVE ABOUT WHO SAW THIS, ANY

88
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,368
CHANGES THEY MAY HAVE

89
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:22,369
RECOMMENDED.

90
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:23,203
>> Shannon: THAT IS PROBABLY

91
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:25,005
WHAT HE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING,

92
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,373
SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

93
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:26,973
MODIFICATIONS OF OUR

94
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,108
JAMES COMEY, THAN FBI DIRECTOR,

95
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,744
CAME UP WITH THE WORDING, WHAT

96
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:31,278
WAS CHANGED.

97
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,946
I'M SURE THOSE THINGS WILL SPELL

98
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:33,980
OUT.

99
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,081
YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT THOSE

100
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:35,749
QUESTIONS.

101
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,217
>> WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

102
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,818
>> Shannon: I WANT TO ASK YOU

103
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,387
ABOUT THIS MEETING BEHIND CLOSED

104
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:42,155
DOORS TODAY WITH THE G.O.P. ON

105
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:44,191
THE HOUSE SIDE, TALKING ABOUT

106
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:44,958
THE MATTERS OF IMMIGRATION.

107
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,193
IT'S GOTTEN TO A VERY TENSE

108
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:47,661
LEVEL, IT SOUNDS LIKE TO THOSE

109
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,229
OF US ON THE OUTSIDE.

110
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,030
THE COMPETING INTERESTS ABOUT

111
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,766
WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE ABOUT

112
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,534
SPEED 11, FORCING SOMETHING TO

113
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:57,470
THE FORE.

114
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,538
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING?

115
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:00,740
>> WE HAD SOMETHING THAT HAS

116
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,675
BEEN LONG OVERDUE.

117
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:03,410
WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A MEETING

118
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,144
OF OUR CONFERENCE ON THE CITY,

119
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,146
AND IS NOW COME TO A HEAD

120
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,747
BECAUSE OF THE DISCHARGE

121
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,115
PETITION, BECAUSE OF PRESSURE

122
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:11,151
FROM ALSO FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS

123
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:11,818
FROM ALSO FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBER

124
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:12,619
MEMBERS, AND IT'S A GOOD THING

125
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:13,987
THAT IS COMING TO A HEAD, IT'S

126
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:17,157
NOT A GOOD THING IF WE GO INTO A

127
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:17,824
DISCHARGE PETITION PROCESS

128
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,093
BECAUSE WE COULD GET A VERY

129
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:22,796
UNBALANCED BILL THAT DOESN'T

130
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:23,763
REFLECT WHAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS

131
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:24,831
AND WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE

132
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,766
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT IN TERMS OF

133
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:27,734
ENFORCEMENT OF OUR IMMIGRATION

134
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,369
LAWS, WHILE ALSO DOING SOMETHING

135
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:31,037
FOR DACA, WHICH IS WHAT THE BELL

136
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:33,139
I'VE INTRODUCED ALONG WITH

137
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,307
MIKE MCCAUL AND RAUL LABRADOR

138
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:35,342
AND MARTHA McSALLY, THE CHEERS

139
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:38,979
OF THE HOMELAND COMMITTEE, AND

140
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:39,613
THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF THE

141
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,182
DISCUSSION THIS MORNING.

142
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,283
TELL MIKE OF THE ENTIRE

143
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:43,783
CONFERENCE.

144
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,385
WE HAD MANY MEMBERS TO SPEAK UP

145
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:46,453
AND I THINK IT WAS VERY

146
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:46,853
PRODUCTIVE.

147
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:50,323
I THINK IT IS LEADING TOWARD THE

148
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:52,259
CONSENSUS BUT WE ARE NOT THERE

149
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:52,592
YET.

150
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:53,360
>> Shannon: CONGRESSMAN STEVE

151
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,928
KING, A FELLOW REPUBLICAN IF

152
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,730
YOURS, SAID EVERY ONE OF THE

153
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,865
BILLS HE SAW HAS AMNESTY IN IT.

154
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,034
HE JUST WANTS TO SEE A BILL THAT

155
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,135
DOES NOT HAVE AMNESTY.

156
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,337
>> MOST PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE

157
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:06,940
PRESIDENT, HAVE CALLED FOR DOING

158
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,674
SOMETHING APPROPRIATE FOR THE

159
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:09,743
DACA RECIPIENTS.

160
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:12,078
HOWEVER, WE HAVE TO -- THAT'S

161
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,813
ONE PILLAR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

162
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:14,547
FOUR PILLARS.

163
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,149
THE OTHERS, THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE

164
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,916
MET.

165
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,952
SECURING THE BORDER, CLOSING THE

166
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:22,355
LOOP HOLES ON AMNESTY AND OTHER

167
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:23,556
ASPECTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,

168
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,592
INTERIOR ENFORCEMENT, AND ALSO

169
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:28,728
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING

170
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,363
TOWARD A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION

171
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,131
SYSTEM BY ENDING EXTENDED FAMILY

172
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:34,701
CHAIN MIGRATION AND THE VISA

173
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:35,068
LOTTERY.

174
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,903
THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE ARE

175
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:37,304
WORKING ON.

176
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:40,407
HOW YOU DO THAT FOR THE DACA

177
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:42,342
RECIPIENTS IS THE KEY TO THAT.

178
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:43,843
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL

179
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,078
PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP, AND

180
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,546
OTHER WORDS, SOMETHING THAT ONLY

181
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:48,148
THEY CAN HAVE, SOMETHING THEY

182
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:49,416
ARE ELIGIBLE, BUT ANYONE WHO HAS

183
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,450
FOLLOWED THE LAW IS ALSO

184
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,152
ELIGIBLE FOR IT, I THINK THAT IS

185
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:55,121
A MUCH MORE ACCEPTABLE COURSE OF

186
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,855
ACTION FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF

187
00:04:55,855 --> 00:00:00,000
OUR CONFERENCE.
