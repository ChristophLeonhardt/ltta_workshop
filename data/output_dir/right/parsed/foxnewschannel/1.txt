STEVE: HERE WITH REACTION IN
SOME OF THOSE SOUND BITES
SOCIAL MEDIA STARS AND
DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS
DIAMOND AND SILK JOINING US
FROM DIAMOND AND SILK WORLD
HEADQUARTERS.
LADIES, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HEARD
A LOT OF VOICES IN THE LAST
72 HOURS OR SO WHERE PEOPLE
SAY WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE
SOMEBODY HAS MAILED THESE
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.
AND YOU CAN BLAME DONALD
TRUMP FOR HIS RHETORIC.
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND THIS IS HOW THE
LEFT OPERATES.
WHAT THEY DO IS TRY TO PLACE
BLAME INSTEAD OF BLAMING
THEMSELVES.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO ACCEPT THE OUTCOME
OF THE ELECTION.
WHEN THEY GOT ON THE STREETS
AND MARKED WITH THOSE LITTLE
WITH USE HATS ON INSTEAD OF
GOING TO THE POLLS.
ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY
SAID HARASS TRUMP
SUPPORTERS, KICK THEM WHEN
THEY ARE LOW.
BOMB THE WHITE HOUSE.
SEE, WHATEVER YOU PUT OUT IS
GOING TO COME BACK TO YOU.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> SO YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THIS IS MERELY FEAR TACTIC
BEING USED TO CAUSE CHAOS
AND CONFUSION.
I NEED FOR PEOPLE TO RISE
ABOVE IT.
GO TO THE POLLS, VOTE RED
AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.
STEVE: LADIES, THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES HAS
USED TOUGH RHETORIC.
>> HA HA HA HA.
>> HOLD ON.
BECAUSE, THEY HAVE BEEN
DOING THIS TO OUR PRESIDENT
BEFORE HE EVEN BECAME
PRESIDENT.
WHEN HE THREW HIS HAT IN THE
RING, NOT EVEN A DAY LATER
THEY STARTED CALLING HIM
THESE DEROGATORY NAMES, 9.9%
OF THE LEFT WING NEWS IS
NEGATIVE TOWARD THIS
PRESIDENT AND TOWARDS THIS
COUNTRY.
OUR PRESIDENT ONLY HITS YOU
BACK TWO TIMES WHENEVER YOU
HIT HIM BACK THE FIRST TIME.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
STEVE: THE COUNTER PUNCHER.
AINSLEY: SO, LADIES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AINSLEY: WHAT'S THE SOLUTION
TO THIS, THIS POLITICAL
SEASON BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER
WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.
BUT, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION TO
THIS?
BECAUSE IF YOU DISAGREE WITH
THE RIGHT, THE LEFT HATES
THE RIGHT.
THE RIGHT HATES THE LEFT.
WHAT DO WE DO AS A COUNTRY?
>> WELL, WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO STOP HATING EACH
OTHER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS YOUR
PRESIDENT.
>> YES.
>> HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES IS WHAT WE
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT.
ONCE THEY CAN ACCEPT THAT
THEN WE CAN MOVE OUR COUNTRY
FORWARD.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> THE LEFT IS GOING TO HAVE
TO STOP WITH THIS
FOOLISHNESS, CHAOS,
CONFUSION, FEAR.
YOU ARE PUTTING IT IN THE
MINDS OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
IF YOU ARE REALLY AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
IF THE LEFT WING MEDIA
REALLY CARED ABOUT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU WOULD
NOT CAUSE CHAOS AND
CONFUSION WHEN IT COMES TO
NEWS REPORTING.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BRIAN: A LOT OF PEOPLE
SEEING THE STORY IN THE "THE
WASHINGTON POST" A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS GETTING A LITTLE
PANICKY BECAUSE THIS REMINDS
THEM OF 2016 BECAUSE THEY
EXPECTED SO MUCH AND GOT SO
LITTLE.
>> AND THE PRESIDENT IS
WINNING.
THE ONLY PERSON THEY FEAR.
HE IS WINNING.
HE IS UP IN THE POLLS.
>> MIDTERM ELECTIONS
REPUBLICAN.
>> THEY PARTIES REPUBLICAN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> LISTEN, WE ARE WINNING,
Y'ALL.
THEY DON'T LIKE THAT.
WHAT THEY DO IS MANUFACTURE
STUFF.
>> YEP.
>> TO CREATE CHAOS AND
DISTRACT.
I NEED FOR YOU TO PAY
ATTENTION, GO TO THE POLLS,
VOTE RED, VOTE REPUBLICAN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
DON'T LET WHAT'S HAPPENING
AT THE BORDER DISTRACT YOU.
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE
BORDER IS MANUFACTURED.
THERE IS NO WAY THAT 7,000
PEOPLE IS GOING TO GET ON
THE PHONE AND SAY HEY, I'M
GOING TO MARCH TO THE
BORDER.
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.
HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE USING
THE BATHROOM?
HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GETTING
FOOD AS THEY EVER MARCHING
TO THIS PARTICULAR BORDER?
HOW IS IT THAT WE ARE ABLE
TO SEND TROOPS OTHER TO
OTHER COUNTRIES TO PROTECT
THOSE OTHER COUNTRY'S
BORDERS BUT PEOPLE HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
SENDING TROOPS TO OUR BORDER
TO PROTECT AMERICA?
STEVE: WE HAVE SENT A
REPORTER DOWN TO THE CARAVAN
TO TRY TO GET SOME OF THOSE
