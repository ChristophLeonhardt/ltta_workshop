so Kelly icon where he's gonna go on TV and praise dial Trump in uncomfortable awkward ways now there's a very good reason for this as you're gonna see in a sec but first let's watch something that day I'm gonna repeat now to my colleagues in the White House I said and I like to say mr. Trump I'll never address you by your first name and I don't consider myself your peer and he said okay that sounds great he's a very positive person frankly great thoughts for women and and I the reason I said that was because I do think that it's important to set up that that level of deference and humility when you've got someone who's your boss now the president I say is now the chief of staff a generalist secretary who is is clearly your senior you know your superior oh that was so uncomfortable you know when I talk to Donald Trump I do not use this verb I say dear sir you are my superior yeah oh and she says at the end you have to give proper deference including to general Kelly who's now the chief of staff in other words if I'm up for a position remember general Kelly of course I will submit to you as I do Donald Trump because he is my superior by the way he is great with women am I on Fox News is the president watching this remember mr. president who is loyal to you and who will compliment you in a way that will tickle your fancy and and if we know one thing about Donald Trump he loves to be complimented gee I wonder what Kelly I'm sorry I don't mean to refer to you by your first name Kelly Ann I meant miss Conway ma'am okay one more very important that people not treat elected officials like the president and vice president as their peers that everybody has your key back down there for the office and they want they want that kind of relationship between the staff and the president at the White House to be sure you know the one thing that Donald Trump loves is now remember who the boss is one of the reasons that was given as a possibility wife's firm uchi was fired is not because of his outrageous statements but because Donald Trump thought he was stealing the spotlight so that's why Kellyanne Conway comes on here is like you are the alpha male I am NOT your peer I am NOT your beer oh it's so embarrassing wonderfully embarrassing okay now let's find out why we go to Alex Pfeiffer at the Daily Caller now that's a conservative publication normally very untrustworthy but here it is about what's going on inside the White House and they have some sources there so they say quote there is chatter within the White House that Kellyanne Conway is being looked at as the next communications director really hmm color me surprised of course that this was her audition on Fox is the president this TV set the Fox of course it is okay I'm gonna go in there tell them to watch the other one Oh Dear Leader the Dear Leader's I can't look at him because it's like looking into the Sun he you know he balls a perfect 300 he he once shot a thirty in golf a couple of par fives you understand he has no anus no that's right this Kim Joe good anyway but either way please please hire me wonderfully pathetic watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it anyway you like a TYT Network calm /join
