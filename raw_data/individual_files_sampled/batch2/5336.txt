or Valerie Jarrett just now I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment I'm fine I'm worried about all the people out there who don't have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense the person who's walking down the street minding their own business and they see somebody cling to their purse or one across the street or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation but talk as we call it and those as you say those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day and I think that's why I'm so glad to be here this evening talking with all of you anylock Valerie Jarrett is the embodiment of grace under fire but her words were actually the same words mika brzezinski used after Donald Trump tweeted about her bloody facelift mica said in her first public comments Mika Brzezinski the co-anchor of Morning Joe is so you and I are lucky enough to appear on often Mika said I'm fine but almost exactly what Valerie said I'm worried about the people who don't have a voice you don't have a platform who don't have friends to stick up for them can you speak to that part of what Valerie is trying to articulate there sure so let's let's be clear that Donald Trump is just an exaggerated indication of what's happening in the country he's the tip of the iceberg he's not the iceberg itself and what Valerie Jarrett points points our attention to our directs our attention to is this Nicole we could talk about the politics we could talk about what's happening in the White House and folks who are complicit with it but for a lot of black folk in this country it seems as if in the generality why people have lost their damn minds and we have to raise our children in the midst of this we have to we have to when they go there those two black men in Starbucks they were somebody's babies even though they were grown men that child that a police officer had hung up by his feet at the Waffle House that's somebody's child and so here we are in this environment where many of us in our past in the histories of our families have had people strung up from trees I've had to deal with legal segregation I've had to deal with ongoing insult and injury and harm find ourselves in a historic moment right now where we have to worry about raising our kids we have to worry about whether or not they will have opera tunity so we could talk about the politics but there's something and Steve you get at this you've got you've touched on this there's something deeply insidious that that's borderline evil here and it's not just simply Donald Trump it's about the moral monsters that are running around this country and claiming it as their own and making so many people vulnerable and and and it's you know I just my son just graduated yesterday on Sunday and I'm thinking about how joyous he was how that saw that big beautiful smile and then I got to worry about him Nicole we have to worry about why because we can't seem to look the ugliness of who we are not just simply Donald Trump but who we are and who we have been so that we can imagine ourselves better you know but again as I'm prone to do I'm being a moralist you got me though I want you to keep talking tell me what we do next Eddie Glaude I think it involves an honest confrontation you know I've been I'm working on this book on James Baldwin and Baldwin at the moment in which he died he was deeply and profoundly disillusioned that the country once again had failed to deal with the contradictions at its heart but he said we have no time to despair that those of us who have a vision of democracy we have a fundamental respect for the dignity and standing of all Americans no matter their zip code no matter all of their skin no matter who they love no matter their gender that we have to get out here not just listen but we have to fight we have to fight for a better America and we can't cede it to these folk who are in some ways nurturing themselves in hate and that's going to require not only voting it's going to require getting out and doing the heavy lifting in our neighborhoods with people who often don't look like us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
