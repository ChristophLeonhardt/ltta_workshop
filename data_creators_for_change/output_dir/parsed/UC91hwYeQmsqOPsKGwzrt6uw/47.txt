when I'm home alone now with the kids
it's different
I see everything through my wife's eyes
how would she do it how would she
handled this situation what type of
things is she paying attention to in the
first year it's easy to compare yourself
to your spouse to your mother or anyone
else you admire
looking good keep going more MORE
Raya come here show them more assigned
to your system come here
you want more baby sometimes you want
everything to go as planned but we have
to remember we're dealing with children
and with children accidents are like
seasoning or what could have been a
regular day no no Ryan I know but you
spit it all over her hair dog - I gotta
wash my hair yeah yeah yeah
just put the wipes for now hey come back
but if you add up those regular days and
that's seasoning you add flavor to your
parenting and those flavors marinate who
we are as people so we should be
thankful for the spiciness hey dance
with sister please I'm almost done
you ready
no see papa
Mama's not here thank you so much plum
organic for sponsoring this video and
giving us a lot of goodies so we can try
and eat a nice bus to self-soothe take a
nap and we are going to because true
experience is when you've sat in the
marinade long enough that even a hint of
your presence is something to be savored
she's not here
