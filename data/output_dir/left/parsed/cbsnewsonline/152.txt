SHOOTING VICTIMS HAD TO BE 
AIRLIFTED TO THE HOSPITAL IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION. 
FAMILY SAYS HE IS NOW PARALYZED 
FROM THE NECK DOWN. 
TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE TREATED 
FOR MINOR INJURIES. 
ELAINE? 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SIGNS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO 
BRING A HALT TO HIS 
ADMINISTRATION'S FAMILY 
SEPARATION POLICY. 
WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT BROUGHT 
ABOUT THE CHANGE. 
>>> FOOD RECALLS CAN BE SCARY 
BUT THE CDC SAYS THERE IS 
TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN TRACK AND 
CONTAIN FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENDING A 
HEAVILY CRITICIZED POLICY 
SEPARATING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES 
AT THE U.S. BORDER. 
FOR A WEEK, OFFICIALS ARGUED 
THEY WERE JUST UPHOLDING THE LAW
AND CALLED ON CONGRESS TO COME 
UP WITH A SOLUTION. 
AFTER DAYS OF PUBLIC OUTRAGE, ú 
EXECUTIVE ORDER ROLLING BACK 
FAMILY SEPARATION. 
BEFORE SIGNING THE ORDER, THE 
PRESIDENT SAID HE STILL WANTS 
TO BE TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION. 
>> I CONSIDER IT TO BE A VERY 
IMPORTANT EXECUTIVE ORDER, IT'S 
ABOUT KEEPING FAMILIES 
TOGETHER, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
BEING SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY 
POWERFUL, VERY STRONG BORDER 
AND BORDER SECURITY WILL BE 
EQUAL IF NOT GREATER THAN 
PREVIOUSLY. 
SO WE ARE KEEPING FAMILIES 
TOGETHER AND THIS WILL SOLVE 
THAT PROBLEM. 
ATTHE SAME TIME, WE ARE 
KEEPING A VERY POWERFUL BORDER 
AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A ZERO 
TOLERANCE -- WE HAVE ZERO 
TOLERANCE FOR PEOPLE THAT ENTER 
OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. 
>> JOINING ME NOW FROM 
WASHINGTON IS FRANCO ORDONEZ, 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR 
McCLATCHY NEWS AND THE COHOST OF
McCLATCHY'S MAJORITY-MINORITY 
PODCAST. 
JUST DAYS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID HE WOULD NOT SIGN AN 
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO STOP THE 
SEPARATION POLICY SO WHAT 
BROUGHT ABOUT THIS CHANGE? 
┗> IT 
SUCH A GROUNDSWELL OF 
OPPOSITION TO THIS POLICY 
CHANGE, FROM HIS OWN PARTY, 
LAURA BUSH SPOKE OUT, HIS WIFE 
SPOKE OUT, BUT ALSO WITHIN HIS 
SUPPORTERS, HIS VERY IMPORTANT 
SUPPORTING BASE, ALSO BEGAN TO 
SPEAK OUT. 
LET'S REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT 
THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IS TO 
HIS BASE, YOU HAD FOLKS LIKE 
FRANKLIN GRAHAM
SPEAKING OUT AND SAYING THIS 
WAS NOT THE RIGHT POLICY. 
SO THERE WAS A LOT OF KEY 
PEOPLE AND VERY IMPORTANT 
SUPPORTERS WHO TEND TO BE VERY 
LOYAL ON THIS ISSUE, REALLY 
WENT AGAINST HIM HERE. 
>> PAULA REID REPORTS THAT 
UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ORDER, 
FAMILIES CAN STILL BE SEPARATED 
AFTER 20 DAYS. 
WAS THIS SIMPLY MOVE TO TRY TO 
GET LAWMAKERS TO ACT? 
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION HERE. 
WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE THAT TRUMP 
IS GOING TO MAKE? 
IT'S KIND OF -- IS IT GOING TO 
BE SEEK PERMISSION FIRST OR ASK 
FORGIVENES LATER? 
HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO THIS 
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR 
COURT HEARINGS. 
AS YOU POINT OUT, THEY ONLY CAN 
DO THAT FOR 20 DAYS. 
HE ORDERED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
TO SEEK TO MODIFY AN AGREEMENT. 
THAT REQUIRES THEM ONLY TO DO 
20 DAYS. 
SO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT 
VIOLATING THAT AGREEMENT. 
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THEY WILL TRY 
TO GO, BUT I CAN GUARANTEE IF 
THEY DO AND THEY GO PAST THOSE 
20 DAYS, THERE'S GOING TO BE A 
LOT OF COURT CASES BEING 
POPPING UP. 
>> FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IS 
NOW JOINING THE CHORUS OF THOSE 
WHO HAVE COME OUT AGAINST THE 
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY. 
I WANT TO PLAY A CLIP FROM HIS 
FINAL PRESS CONFERENCE AS 
PRESIDENT WHERE HE DISCUSSED 
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WOULD 
CAUSE HIM TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT. 
>> FOR ME AT LEAST I WOULD PUT 
IN THAT CATEGORY, EFFORTS TO 
ROUND UP KIDS WHO HAVE GROWN UP 
HERE AND FOR ALL PRACTICAL 
PURPOSES ARE AMERICAN KIDS. 
AND SEND THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE. 
THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD 
ARBITRARILY OR BECAUSE OF 
POLITICS PUNISH THOSE KIDS, 
WHEN THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
WRONG THEMSELVES, I THINK WOULD 
BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD MERIT 
ME SPEAKING OUT. 
>> FRANCO, HOW UNUSUAL IS IT 
FOR A FORMER PRESIDENT TO 
CRITICIZE A SITTING PRESIDENT? 
>> VERY UNUSUAL. 
PRESIDENTS TEND TO BE RESPECTFUL
OF FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS, 
GEORGE W. BUSH DID THAT TO 
OBAMA, OBAMA HAS VERY LARGELY 
BEEN KEPT QUIET ON MANY OF 
THESE ISSUES. 
BUT IT SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT THIS 
ISSUE IS TO HIM. 
THAT HE IS SPEAKING OUT. 
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AS WE 
POINTED OUT EARLIER HAS REALLY 
TUGGED ON A LOT OF EMOTIONAL 
STRINGS. 
JAY JOHNSON, DHS SECRETARY, A 
FEW WEEKS AGO WAS OUT SPEAKING 
ABOUT HOW HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
HE DID A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT, A 
LOT OF THE SAME THINGS TRUMP 
DID, BUT HE TRIED NOT TO MAKE 
IT A POLICY TO SEPARATE MOTHERS 
AND CHILDREN. 
>> YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE ANITA 
KUMAR RECENTLY REPORTED THAT 
U.S. OFFICIALS LOST TRACK OF 
NEARLY 6,000 IMMIGRANT CHILDREN
, AND THAT'S A MAJOR INCREASE 
FROM 1500 THAT OFFICIALS SAID. 
HOW DID YOU REACH THAT NUMBER 
AND WHERE IS THE DISCREPANCY 
HERE? 
>> INDEED. 
THE 1500 NUMBER THAT CAME OUT A 
FEW WEEKS AGO REALLY CREATED AN 
OUTCRY AND CONCERN ABOUT 
WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION WAS 
DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB 
PROTECTING THESE VULNERABLE 
KIDS AND PUTTING THEM IN HOMES 
WHERE THEY COULD REMAIN SAFE. 
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION WAS ONLY TAKING 
A FRACTION OF THE YEAR'S 
NUMBER. 
THEY ONLY LOOKED AT THREE 
MONTHS OF DATA, MADE 7,000, A 
LITTLE MORE THAN 7,000 CALLS, 
BUT THE REALITY IS THERE WAS 
MORE THAN 42,000 CHILDREN 
PLACED WITH SPONSORS OVER THE 
LAST YEAR. 
THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS THERE 
WAS ABOUT 14% OF THOSE DIDN'T 
RETURN CALLS AND COULDN'T 
LOCATE WHERE THEY WERE. 
THAT'S NOT 1500. 
THAT'S OVER 6,000. 
OR AROUND 6,000 THAT THEY LOST 
TRACK OF. 
AND IT'S A BIG CONCERN BECAUSE 
IT WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO 
THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO CHANGE 
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO 
PROTECT THESE KIDS AND I WILL 
NOTE THIS WAS UNDER OBAMA, THAT 
ABOUT A HALF DOZEN CHILDREN WHO 
HAD BEEN PLACED WITH SPONSORS 
FOUND THEMSELVES BEING TURNED 
BACK OVER TO NOT FAMILY FRIENDS 
BUT OTHER TRAFFICKERS WHO ENDED 
UP PUTTING THEM ON EGG FIRMS 
DOING PRETTY GRUELING WORK. 
>> TREMENDOUS REPORTING, FRANCO 
ORDONEZ, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARRESTED 
MORE THAN 140 WORKERS AT AN 
OHIO MEATPACKING PLANT TUESDAY. 
THE RAID HAPPENED AT THE FRESH 
MARKET PLANT IN SALEM. 
THE ARRESTS FOLLOW A YEAR-LONG 
IMMIGRATION INVESTIGATION. 
IMMIGRATIONS AND CUSTOM'S AND 
FOR OFFICIALS SAID IT FOCUSED 
ON WHETHER THE COMPANY 
KNOWINGLY HIRED PEOPLE WHO ARE 
IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. 
AND USED FAKE IDENTITIES 
úBELON 
GET THEIR JOBS. 
>>> COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE 
MARKED WORLD REFUGEE DAY 
WEDNESDAY, A NEW REPORT SAYS 
NEARLY 69 MILLION PEOPLE WERE 
DISPLACED IN 2017. 
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT 
44,000 PEOPLE PER DAY. 
MOST REFUGEES CAME FROM SYRIA, 
AFGHANISTAN, SOUTH SUDAN AND 
MYANMAR. 
TINA KRAUSE HAS MORE FROM 
LONDON. 
>> Reporter: THESE REFUGEES 
FROM NORTH AFRICA ARE ON THE 
MOVE AFTER BEING HELD IN THIS 
MIGRANT DETENTION CENTER IN 
LIBYA. 
BEING FLOWN TO NIGER WHERE THEY 
WILL FATE -- WAIT TO BE 
RESETTLED IN EUROPE OR NORTH 
AMERICA. 
THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR 
REFUGEES S TRAVELING WITH THEM 
AND SAYS THE WORLD SHOULD SHOW 
COMPASSION. 
>> TERRIBLE STORIES OF THE 
JOURNEYS THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE 
GONE THROUGH, MANY WOMEN HAVING 
BEEN RAPED, MANY WOMEN HAVING 
DELIVERED CHILDREN WHEN THEY 
ARRIVED. 
>> Reporter: ON THIS REFUGEE 
DAY, CAMPS IN BANGLADESH ARE 
BURSTING AT THE SEAMS. 
MORE THAN 700,000 ROHINGYA 
MUSLIMS FROM MYANMAR HAVE 
CROSSED THE BORDER TO ESCAPE A 
VIOLENT ARMY CRACKDOWN. 
WORLDWIDE, TURKEY HAS THE 
HIGHEST NUMBER OF REFUGEES WITH 
3.5 MILLION, MOSTLY SYRIANS. 
LAST WEEK, ITALY'S NEW ANTI-
IMMIGRATION GOVERNMENT TURNED 
AWAY A SHIP FULL OF MORE THAN 
600 PEOPLE RESCUED OFF THE 
COAST OF LIBYA. 
ITALY'S INTERIOR MINISTER 
ARGUED THE MAJORITY SAVED ARE 
ECONOMIC MIGRANTS NOT REFUGEES. 
SPAIN OPENED ITS PORT AND TOOK 
THEM IN. 
POPE FRANCIS IS URGING PEOPLE 
NOT TO TURN THEIR BACKS. 
USING THE HASHTAG WITH REFUGEES 
HE TWEETED, DO NOT LET FEAR GET 
IN THE WAY OF WELCOMING OUR 
NEIGHBOR IN NEED. 
BUT WITH MORE MIGRANTS AND 
REFUGEES ARRIVING ON EUROPE'S 
SHORES EACH DAY, THE POLITICAL 
BATTLE OVER WHO SHOULD WELCOME 
THEM IS FAR FROM OVER. 
TINA KRAUSE, CBS NEWS. 
>>> THE UNITED STATES IS NOT 
THE ONLY FORMER ENGLISH COLONY 
EMBROILED IN A NATIONAL FIGHT 
OVER IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM. 
OVER THE PAST DECADE, AUSTRALIA 
HAS BEEN DEALING WITH ITS OWN 
CONTROVERSY ABOUT ASYLUM-
SEEKERS BEING HELD ON ISLAND 
DETENTION CENTERS. 
IN 2016, PRESIDENT OBAMA 
REACHED A DEAL WITH CRIME 
MINISTER MALCOLM TURNBULL TO 
SWAP REFUGEES BEING HELD BY 
AUSTRALIA IN EXCHANGE FOR 
ASYLUM-SEEKERS HEADED TO THE 
U.S. FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. 
BUT AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK 
OFFICE IN 2017, A TRANSCRIPT OF 
HIS CONTENTIOUS CALL WITH 
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER 
TURNBULL LEAKED. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY SAID 
HE HATES TAKING IN THESE 
PEOPLE. 
IN RESPONSE, TURNBULL TOLD THE 
U.S. PRESIDENT, A DEAL IS A 
DEAL AND YOU ARE GOING TO STICK 
WITH IT. 
HUGH REMINGTON IS A SENIOR 
REPORTER FOR TEN EYEWITNESS 
NEWS IN AUSTRALIA, HE JOINS ME 
NOW FROM SYDNEY. 
WELCOME TO YOU. 
>> HELLO. 
>> BEFORE WE DIVE INTO 
AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY, EYEGLASS 
TWO -- I'D LIKE TO ASK HOW THE 
CURRENT BATTLE OVER IMMIGRATION 
IS BEING VIEWED BY PEOPLE IN 
AUSTRALIA.
>> WELL, I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN 
AUSTRALIA LOOK AT WHAT'S 
HAPPENING THERE IN THE UNITED 
STATES WITH A MIXTURE OF HORROR 
BUT ALSO A SENSE OF DEJA VU 
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLY 
THE KEY ISSUE OUTSIDE STREET 
ECONOMICS OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE CENTURY. 
ASYLUM SEEKER ARRIVALS, REFUGEE 
ARRIVALS, AUSTRALIA DOESN'T 
HAVE ANY LAND BORDERS, SO THE 
ISSUE HAS BEEN PEOPLE ARRIVING 
BY SEA, USUALLY USING INDONESIA 
AS A JUMP OFF POINT. 
THERE HAVE BEEN TENS OF 
THOUSANDS WHO HAVE MADE THAT 
TRIP OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
LAST 20 YEARS. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU MORE ABOUT 
THAT, ASYLUM-SEEKERS, TAKE US 
THROUGH AUSTRALIA'S RECENT 
HISTORY OF REFUGEE BOAT 
ARRIVALS AND ISLAND DETENTION 
CENTERS SPECIFICALLY. 
>> THERE HAS BEEN OVER THE 
COURSE OF THE CENTURY 
GOVERNMENTS ON BOTH SIDES TRIED 
TO MANAGE THIS ASYLUM SEEKER 
FLOW. 
IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIX 
OR SEVEN YEARS, BOTH SIDES OF 
POLITICS HAVE ESSENTIALLY HAD 
THE SAME POLICY AND
THAT IS HARSH MEASURES TO TRY TO
DISCOURAGE PEOPLE ARRIVING BY 
BOAT. 
BOTH PARTIES HAVE A POLICY NOW 
THAT NO ONE WHO TRIES TO GET 
HERE BY BOAT WILL EVER SET FOOT 
IN AUSTRALIA. 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS THEY 
HAVE SHIPPED THEM OFF TO TWO 
LITTLE ISLANDS, CAMPS INITIALLY 
ACROSS THE PACIFIC, ONE IN 
PAPUA NEW GUINEA, THE OTHER, A 
TINY REPUBLIC WITH A POPULATION 
OF 10,000, THEY HAVE BEEN SENT 
TO THESE PLACES AND THEY REMAIN 
THERE, THERE ARE 1700 REFUGEES, 
MANY FOUND BY INTERNATIONAL LAW 
TO BE REFUGEES, WITH NO HOPE OF 
EVER LEAVING AT THE MOMENT. 
>> AND I THINK AS WE SHOW OUR 
VIEWERS SOME OF THESE IMAGES, 
IF YOU CAN, TELL US ABOUT THE 
CONDITIONS WE KNOW EXIST IN 
SOME OF THESE AREAS, IN THESE 
DETENTION CENTERS AND THE FACT 
THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL RECOURSE 
AVAILABLE AS I UNDERSTAND IT TO 
THOSE BEING HELD THERE. 
>> THEY ARE STUCK THERE, IT IS 
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FOR THE TWO 
ISLANDS. 
THE FAMILY GROUPS WERE SENT OFF 
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NORA, 
INDIVIDUAL MERMEN WERE SENT OFF 
TO MENACE ISLAND, SMALL ISLAND 
IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA. 
A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE SUPREME 
COURT RULED THAT THERE 
DETENTION FACILITY WAS ILLEGAL 
UNDER PAPUA NEW GUINEA LAW SO 
THEY HAVE BEEN UNWINDING THOSE 
CAMPS AND IN FACT HAVE SHUT 
DOWN THE CAMP IN PAPUA NEW 
GUINEA BUT THAT LEAVES THOSE 
PEOPLE, 700 MEN, ESSENTIALLY 
LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY IN THIS 
TINY ISLAND, THEY ARE NOT
WELL-RECEIVED IN GENERAL BY THE 
LOCAL POPULATION, THERE HAS 
BEEN VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM AND 
IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE WITH
NO PROSPECT OF GOING ANYWHERE 
ELSE EXCEPT FOR THE U.S. DEAL 
THAT BARACK OBAMA NEGOTIATED. 
ON NAURU, THEY GET TO MOVE 
AROUND THIS TINY ISLAND BUT 
THEY ARE BASICALLY STUCK THERE, 
EFFECTIVELY A PERSON FOR THEM. 
>> THIS REACHED A POINT OF 
CONTENTION IN THE UNITED STATES 
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS 
ON THE DEAL THAT
TURNBULL STRUCK WITH PRESIDENT 
OBAMA TO SWAP REFUGEES -- 
REALLY GOT A LOT OF PLAY, THE 
LEAKED COMMENTS FROM THAT 
CONVERSATION, HOW DID 
AUSTRALIANS VIEW THAT? 
>> I THINK AT THE TIME, REMEMBER
THIS IS THE FIRST ACTUAL PHONE 
CALL BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER 
AND THE NEWLY ARRIVED 
PRESIDENT. 
AUSTRALIANS OF ALL POLITICAL 
COLORS GENERALLY FEEL 
THEMSELVES TO BE CLOSE TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS A 
REPUBLICAN, THE GOVERNMENT IN 
OFFICE WAS ESSENTIALLY A 
CONSERVATIVE COALITION, 
EFFECTIVELY SIBLING POLITICAL 
PARTIES, THEY SHOULD BE CLOSE. 
SO THE THEATER OF THE SCENE OF 
THAT TERSE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE 
NEW PRESIDENT AND A 
CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER WAS 
A SOURCE OF GREAT FASCINATION 
HERE. 
IT WAS PERHAPS AN EARLY INSIGHT 
INTO HOW DIFFERENT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE TO HIS 
PREDECESSORS IN THE WAY HE 
HANDLED FRIENDSHIPS, ALLIANCES 
AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 
I THINK THAT WAS OF MORE 
INTEREST THAN THE DETAIL OF 
TRYING TO STITCH UP AND AFFIRM 
THAT REFUGEE DEAL. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU, WHEN IT WAS 
ANNOUNCED, THERE WAS A LOT OF 
PUSHBACK FROM THE REFUGEES 
THEMSELVES AS I UNDERSTAND IT. 
SOME OF WHOM DID NOT WANT TO 
COME TO AMERICA. 
AND THOSE WHO APPLIED, NOT ALL 
OF THEM HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED. 
WHAT'S THE LATEST ON THIS? 
>> WELL, SOME DIDN'T WANT TO 
APPLY, OTHERS DID. 
MORE APPLIED THAN HAVE BEEN 
ACCEPTED. 
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS, EVEN IF 
THE SUBJECT OF EXTREME VETTING 
WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP INSISTED 
UPON, THE FULL 1250 MAXIMUM 
WHICH WAS ALLOWED UNDER THE 
OBAMA DEAL WERE TO BE TAKEN, 
THAT WOULD LEAVE OTHERS ON THE 
ISLANDS SO THERE IS STILL ABOUT 
1700 ON THOSE ISLANDS. 
THERE ARE NO OTHER THIRD 
COUNTRIES LOOKING TO ACCEPT 
THEM OTHER THAN NEW ZEALAND. 
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE 
ONCE THEY GET CITIZENSHIP, THEY 
CAN MOVE DIRECTLY TO AUSTRALIA 
UNDER THE DEAL BETWEEN THOSE 
TWO COUNTRIES. 
THAT MEANS THEY WOULD HAVE SET 
FOOT IN AUSTRALIA AND THAT 
WOULD BREACH THE RULES OF BOTH 
--
>>> ALL RIGHT, WE ARE 
INTERRUPTING OUR CONVERSATION 
WITH HUGH REMINGTON TO SHOW YOU 
THIS IMAGE, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TAKING THE STAGE IN DULUTH, 
MINNESOTA. 
FOR HIS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

WOULD HAVE SAID THAT TO YOU 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THOSE VERY 
DISHONEST PEOPLE BACK THERE, 
THE FAKE NEWS -- 
>> 
>> VERY DISHONEST, THEY WOULD 
HAVE SAID HE'S EXAGGERATING. 
>> 
>> THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST 
PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM. 
AND WE HAVE SOME FINE PEOPLE 
TOO DOING THAT, BUT THERE'S A 
LOT OF DISHONEST PEOPLE FORCED 
-- FOR INSTANCE, I JUST GOT 
BACK AS YOU KNOW FROM 
SINGAPORE, WHERE I MET -- 
>>  -- 
>> WHERE I MET KIM JONG-UN. 
AND WE HAD A GREAT MEETING, 
GREAT CHEMISTRY, WE GOT ALONG 
REALLY WELL WHICH IS VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
THEY DIDN'T WANT US TO BUT IT'S 
LIKE, NICE TO DO THAT. 
AND VERY INTERESTINGLY, AT 
FIRST EVERYBODY WAS AMAZED, 
AMAZED THAT WE HAD THE MEETING. 
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, THE 
FIRST 24 HOURS, THEY SAID, I 
CAN'T BELIEVE IT, REMEMBER 
THAT, A WHILE AGO? 
THEY SAID THEY'RE GOING TO 
MEET. 
A DAY LATER THEY SAID, WHAT'S 
THE BIG DEAL WITH THE MEETING? 
IN OTHER WORDS, THEIR BOSSES 
SAID YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. 
BUT THE BEAUTY WAS THIS. 
SO WE HAD A MEETING, IT WAS AN 
INCREDIBLE SUCCESS. 
AND THEY SAID, THE PRESIDENT 
GAVE AWAY SO MUCH. 
HE MET WITH THEM. 
I SAID, WHAT ELSE? 
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? 
I HAVE TO MEET, RIGHT? 
HE MET! 
NOW, SENTENCE ONE SAYS A TOTAL 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH 
KOREA. 
>> 
>> WE GOT BACK OUR HOSTAGES. 
AND I DIDN'T PAY $1.8 BILLION 
TO GET BACK OUR HOSTAGES. 
>> 
>> WE GOT BACK OUR GREAT FALLEN 
HEROES, THE REMAINS, IN FACT, 
TODAY, ALREADY, 200 HAVE BEEN 
SENT BACK. 
>> 
>> THEY STOP SHOOTING MISSILES 
OVER JAPAN. 
THEY STOPPED ALL NUCLEAR 
TESTING. 
THEY STOPPED NUCLEAR RESEARCH. 
THEY STOPPED ROCKETRY. 
THEY STOPPED EVERYTHING THAT 
úY 
AND THEY BLEW UP SITES WHERE 
THEY TEST. 
AND DO THE TESTING. 
AND IT WAS A GREAT MEETING. 
AND KIM JONG-UN WILL TURN DOWN 
-- AND I WILL TELL YOU -- HE 
WILL -- CHAIRMAN KIM WILL TURN 
THAT COUNTRY INTO A GREAT 
SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY. 
AND LET ME TELL YOU, LET ME 
TELL YOU, LET ME TELL YOU THIS. 
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, NOBODY 
THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE. 
IN FACT, BEFORE I WAS ELECTED, 
EVERYBODY ASSUMED WE WERE GOING 
TO WAR. 
IT WOULD BE A VICIOUS WAR, IN 
SEOUL, YOU HAVE 28 MILLION 
PEOPLE LIVING 30 MILES OFF THE 
BORDER. 
THEY DON'T EVEN NEED NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS FOR THAT. 
THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF CANNONS 
AIMING ON TOP OF SEOUL. 
YOU COULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS 
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. 
BUT I GOT ALONG WITH KIM JONG-
UN. 
I GOT ALONG. 
>> 
>> AND THAT'S A GOOD THING, NOT 
A BAD THING. 
AND THESE PEOPLE, YOU REMEMBER, 
I SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 
HE'S GIVING AWAY SO MUCH, YOU 
KNOW WHAT I GAVE AWAY? 
A MEETING. 
THAT WAS A MEETING. 
AND THE FACT THAT WE DO GET 
ALONG MEANS WE ARE SAFE, I'M 
NOT SAYING THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN, 
THINGS GO WRONG, MISTAKES ARE 
MADE. 
RELATIONSHIPS GET BROKEN. 
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE SO SAFE 
AND SUCH A GREAT EVENT TOOK 
PLACE AND ALL OVER ASIA -- 
>> 
>> AND ALL OVER ASIA, THEY'RE 
CELEBRATING THE GREAT 
ACHIEVEMENT THAT WE MADE 
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONES THAT 
PUT ME HERE. 
WE MADE. 
THAT WE MADE. 
ALL OVER ASIA. 
AND REALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
BY THE WAY, IN OUR COUNTRY, 
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT A GREAT 
ACHIEVEMENT THIS IS, NOT ONLY 
FOR US BUT FOR NORTH KOREA, FOR 
SOUTH KOREA, FOR JAPAN, FOR 
CHINA, FOR EVERYBODY AND I HAVE 
TO SAY, YOU'VE BEEN READING 
WHERE I'VE BEEN PUTTING VERY 
LARGE TARIFFS ON CHINA. 
VERY, VERY LARGE. 
WE HIT THE 250 BILLION MARK. 
BUT I WANT TO SAY, AND WE HAVE 
TO DO THAT, BECAUSE IT HAS TO 
BE BALANCED, IT HAS TO BE FAIR, 
IT WASN'T FAIR, CHINA AND 
PRESIDENT XI HAS REALLY HELPED 
US A LOT AT THE BORDER. 
OF NORTH KOREA, REALLY HELPED 
US A LOT. 
AND HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. 
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. 
SO YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF 
YOURSELVES FOR WHAT TOOK PLACE, 
BECAUSE THAT WAS VERY CLOSE TO 
WAR FOR MANY YEARS. 
MANY YEARS. 
IT WAS VERY, VERY CLOSE. 
AND NOW WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING 
WHERE EVERYBODY IS GOING TO 
LIVE IN PEACE FOR A LONG PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
AND THERE WILL BE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
SO THAT'S THE REAL STORY, THANK 
YOU. 
>>  
>> THAT'S THE REAL STORY. 
SO UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE 
AMONG THE BEST IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>> 
>> HISPANIC AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED ITS 
LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED. 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>> 
>> AND REMEMBER, I'D GO INTO 
BIG STADIUMS LIKE THIS THAT 
WERE PACKED, AND BY THE WAY, 
YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT REAL 
ESTATE, DID YOU SEE THE 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT WILL NEVER 
BE REPORTED BY THE FAKE NEWS, 
BUT THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE -- 
THAT COULDN'T GET IN? 
MANY THOUSANDS, THEY ARE ALL 
OVER, THE PARKING LOTS, THEY'RE 
ALL OVER. 
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE 
CAMERAS COULD TAKE A SHOT OF 
THE ARENA. 
>> 
>> SO USUALLY, THEY DON'T DO IT 
AND I USUALLY GO HOME AND MY 
WIFE WOULD SAY, HOW WAS THE 
CROWD? 
ALTHOUGH HONESTLY, WHEN YOU 
HAVE MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
LIKE WE HAVE TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, 
I WAS AT AN EVENT THREE WEEKS 
AGO, WHERE A PERSON FROM "THE 
NEW YORK TIMES" SAID, THERE WAS 
ONLY A THOUSAND PEOPLE. 
AND THE PEOPLE, THE MANY 
THOUSANDS THAT WERE THERE, 
PROTESTED. 
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO DO IT. 
AND THEY WROTE A SLIGHT 
CORRECTION, THEY WERE OFF BY 
MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. 
THAT'S THE WAY -- FAKE NEWS, 
I'M TELLING YOU, SO FAKE. 
BUT USUALLY, HEY DON'T SHOW 
THE ARENA, THEY JUST SHOW MY 
FACE. 
SO PEOPLE WOULD SAY DID YOU 
HAVE MANY PEOPLE THERE? 
DIDN'T YOU SEE -- NO, THEY ONLY 
SHOW YOUR FACE. 
AND WE ALL HAVE A GO BUT I 
DON'T WANT TO SHOW MY FACE, I 
WANT TO SHOW THE CROWDS. 
IT'S MUCH PRETTIER. 
BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE ARE 
INCREDIBLE. 
UNEMPLOYMENT. 
AMONG WOMEN HAS REACHED THE 
LOWEST LEVEL AS OF TODAY IN 65 
YEARS! 
65 YEARS. 
>> 
>> AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, 
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. 
WE ARE RESPECTED. 
WE ARE FIGHTING TO PROTECT 
AMERICAN IRON, ALUMINUM, AND 
STEEL, AND TO PROTECT OUR 
INCREDIBLE AND VERY BRAVE
MINERS. 
BUT I'LL TELL YOU, TO KEEP THIS 
INCREDIBLE MOMENTUM -- I THINK 
MAYBE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THAT 
THE COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD -- I 
THINK WE ARE NOW AT THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL LEVEL THAT THE 
COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN, THAT'S 
HOW WE ARE DOING. 
AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU, 
BECAUSE I HEAR A COUPLE OF THE 
FAKERS THE OTHER DAY, SAY, I 
THINK IT'S OBAMA'S ECONOMY. 
OBAMA'S ECONOMY? 
OBAMA? 
>> 
>> THEY WOULD HAVE PUT ON MORE 
REGULATIONS, THEY WANT TO TAKE 
BACK YOUR TAX CUTS WHICH ARE 
MASSIVE, THEY WANT TO TAKE THEM 
BACK AND THEY WANT TO RAISE THE 
HELL OUT OF YOUR TAXES AND THE 
WHOLE THING WILL GO BOOM. 
>>  
>> SO WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS, 
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT THERE IN 
THE MIDTERMS, WE'VE GOT TO GET 
MORE REPUBLICANS. 
GOT TO GET MORE REPUBLICANS. 
A VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT FOR 
CONGRESS IS REALLY A VOTE FOR 
NANCY PELOSI. 
AND HER RADICAL AGENDA. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES, INCREASE YOUR 
REGULATIONS, SHUT DOWN AMERICAN 
ENERGY, TAKE OVER AMERICAN 
HEALTHCARE, WHICH HAS BEEN A 
DISASTER WITH OBAMACARE, AND 
SHIPPED AWAY AMERICAN JOBS, AND 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL DO IF 
ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS TO THIS 
COUNTRY. 
IT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR ALL 
OF YOU. 
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT 
HAPPEN. 
WE WORKED TOO HARD TO GET HERE. 
>> 
>> AND THE GREATEST PHRASE I 
THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF 
POLITICS, IS ON ALL OF THOSE 
RED AND WHITE HATS THAT I SEE 
OUT THERE, MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE 
DOING. 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT OUR NEW 
PHRASE IS 2 1/2 YEARS? 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, RIGHT? 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS BECAUSE 
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. 
SO THE DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN 
BORDERS, LET EVERYBODY COME IN. 
>>  
>> LET EVERYBODY POUR IN, WE 
DON'T CARE, LET THEM COME IN 
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, LET THEM 
COME IN FROM ALL OVER THE 
PLACE, WE DON'T CARE. 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT 
HAPPEN. 
AND BY THE WAY, TODAY, I SIGNED 
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, WE'RE GOING 
TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER, BUT 
THE BORDER IS GOING TO BE JUST 
AS TOUGH AS IT'S BEEN. 
>> 
>> DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ABOUT 
THE IMPACT OF UNCONTROLLED 
MIGRATION ON YOUR COMMUNITIES, 
YOUR SCHOOLS, YOUR HOSPITALS, 
YOUR JOBS OR YOUR SAFETY. 
DEMOCRATS PUT ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS BEFORE THEY PUT 
AMERICAN CITIZENS. 
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION COSTS OUR 
COUNTRY HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS. 
SO IMAGINE IF WE COULD SPEND 
THAT MONEY TO HELP BRING 
OPPORTUNITY TO OUR INNER CITIES 
AND OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND 
OUR ROADS AND OUR HIGHWAYS AND 
OUR SCHOOLS. 
>>  BUILD THAT 
WALL! 
>> SO WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE 
WALL. 
WE GOT 1.6 BILLION. 
THE WALL HAS BEEN STARTED. 
SAN DIEGO AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT 
PLACES, AND WE GO, BUT, BOY, 
IT'S TOUGH. 
THEY WANT TO DO ANYTHING THEY 
CAN TO OBSTRUCT AND TO MAKE 
SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, BUT 
IT'S HAPPENING. 
IT'S HAPPENING. 
WE HAVE A SINGLE PROTESTER, 
THERE HE GOES. 
GOODBYE, DARLING. 
GOODBYE, DARLING. 
>> 
>> SO WE HAVE A SINGLE 
PROTESTER. 
HE'S GOING HOME TO HIS MOM, SAY 
HELLO TO MOMMY. 
>> 
>> AND TOMORROW, THE FAKE NEWS 
WILL SAY TOMORROW, MASSIVE 
PROTESTS AT THE TRUMP RALLY. 
ONE PERSON. 
MASSIVE PROTESTS. 
AYAIAI. 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT GREAT 
FOR AMERICANS AND TAKE CARE OF 
PEOPLE AND WE DO WANT PEOPLE 
COMING ACROSS OUR BORDER GOING 
THROUGH OUR PORTS OF ENTRY, BUT 
WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN 
THROUGH MERIT. 
NOT JUST THROUGH LUCK OR 
HAPPENSTANCE. 
WE WANT THEM TO COME IN THROUGH 
MERIT. 
AND WE NEED PEOPLE BECAUSE WE 
HAVE SO MANY COMPANIES NOW AND 
YOU KNOW VERY WELL IN MINNESOTA 
WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY JUST 
GIVE ME A RUN THROUGH WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IN MINNESOTA IS 
INCREDIBLE, BUT WE HAVE SO MANY 
COMPANIES MOVING BACK INTO OUR 
COUNTRY, WE NEED PEOPLE TO HELP 
BUT WE WANT THEM TO COME IN 
THROUGH THE MERIT SYSTEM, NOT
A SYSTEM WHERE WE GET MS-13 AND 
EVERYBODY ELSE THAT OTHER 
COUNTRIES DON'T WANT. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS OPEN BORDER 
POLICIES HAVE ALSO ALLOWED MS-13
TO BREAK INTO OUR COUNTRY AND 
DRUGS TO POUR INTO OUR STREETS, 
AND WE'RE STOPPING IT. 
WE HAVE TAKEN OUT OF OUR COUNTRY
-- CAN YOU BELIEVE I HAVE TO 
SAY THIS -- WE HAVE LIBERATED 
TOWNS. 
LIKE IT WAS CAPTURED BY A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE LIBERATED TOWNS OUT IN 
LONG ISLAND. 
MS-13 GANGS, WE HAVE TAKEN THEM 
OUT OF OUR COUNTRY BY THE 
THOUSANDS. 
>> 
>> AND THESE COUNTRIES THAT 
SEND THEM BACK, WE ARE PUTTING 
IN LEGISLATION, WE ARE NOT 
GIVING THEM ANY MORE AID WHEN 
THEY SEND PEOPLE UP -- REMEMBER 
THE ORIGINAL SPEECH, RIGHT? 
MY ORIGINAL SPEECH, THEY ARE 
SENDING -- DO YOUR MEMBER THOSE 
WORDS, EVERYBODY SAID, HOW 
TERRIBLE, LET ME TELL YOU, 
THEY'RE SENDING -- AND THEY'RE 
NOT SENDING THEIR FINEST, THAT 
I CAN TELL YOU -- AND WE ARE 
SENDING THEM THE HELL BACK AND 
WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WHAT WE ARE 
DOING -- WE GIVE HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF AID TO 
COUNTRIES, WE HAVE A HORRIBLE 
DEAL AS AN EXAMPLE, WITH NAFTA 
AND MEXICO, HORRIBLE DEAL. 
THEY MAKE OVER $100 BILLION ON 
THAT HORRIBLE TRADE DEAL, WHERE 
FACTORIES WERE EMPTIED, SO MANY 
BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED, AND 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT A PART 
OF NAFTA. 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MARK UP 
THOUSANDS OF MILES COMING 
THROUGH MEXICO, YOU COME UP 
THOUSANDS OF MILES, COMING 
THROUGH MEXICO, AND WE'RE GOING 
TO STOP IT. 
GET HIM OUT OF HERE. 
GET HIM OUT OF HERE. 
>> 
>> GO HOME TO YOUR MOM, 
DARLING. 
GO HOME. 
GET HIM OUT OF HERE. 
OUT. 
>>  
>> WAS THAT A MAN OR A WOMAN? 
BECAUSE HE NEEDS A HAIRCUT MORE 
THAN I DO. 
>> 
>> COULDN'T TELL. 
I COULDN'T TELL. 
NEEDS A HAIRCUT. 
BUT THE MEDIA NEVER TALKS ABOUT 
THE AMERICAN VICTIMS OF ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
I KNOW THEM WELL, I KNOW SO 
MANY OF THEM, I CAMPAIGNED WITH 
THEM. 
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEIR 
CHILDREN, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO 
THEIR CHILDREN, WHAT'S HAPPENED 
TO THEIR WIVES. 
THE MEDIA DOESN'T TALK ABOUT 
THE AMERICAN FAMILIES 
PERMANENTLY SEPARATED FROM 
THEIR LOVED ONES, BECAUSE
DEMOCRAT POLICIES RELEASE 
VIOLENT CRIMINALS INTO OUR 
COMMUNITIES. 
WE NEED SAFETY. 
WE NEED SAFETY. 
THEY DON'T BRING CAMERAS TO 
INTERVIEW THE ANGEL MOMS WHOSE 
CHILDREN WERE KILLED BY 
CRIMINAL ALIENS WHO SHOULD HAVE 
NEVER BEEN HERE IN THE FIRST 
PLACE, NOT EVEN CLOSE. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO THE 
ANGEL MOMS. 
BUT AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL 
ALWAYS FIGHT TO PROTECT 
AMERICAN FAMILIES. 
ALWAYS. 
I WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR AN 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT DEFENDS 
OUR BORDERS, AND TAKES CARE OF 
OUR SOVEREIGNTY AS A NATION. 
I WILL NEVER SACRIFICE THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND I WILL NEVER BE SILENT IN 
THE FACE OF VICIOUS SMEARS AND 
ATTACKS AND THE HEROIC AGENTS 
AND OFFICES OF I.C.E. 
AND THE BORDER PATROL WHO SAVE 
MILLIONS, JUST THE JOB THEY DO 
-- SAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS 
OF LIVES, AND ARE SO BRAVE AND 
ARE SO TOUGH -- IF YOU WANT TO 
CREATE A HUMANE, LAWFUL SYSTEM 
OF IMMIGRATION, THEN YOU NEED 
TO RETIRE THE DEMOCRATS AND 
ELECT REPUBLICANS TO FINALLY 
SECURE OUR BORDERS. 
>>  
>> BECAUSE WE NEED DEMOCRAT 
VOTES. 
WE HAVE A MAJORITY OF ONE. 
IN THE SENATE. 
WE NEED DEMOCRAT VOTES IN THE 
SENATE, WE NEED ADDITIONAL 
VOTES IN THE HOUSE. 
WE WILL HAVE THE GREATEST 
BORDERS, THE GREATEST WALLS, 
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED, BUT IT'S 
A LOT TOUGHER THAN IT USED TO 
BE. 
WE NEED REPUBLICANS TO GET OUT 
AND PUT REPUBLICANS IN, IN CASE 
YOU DON'T KNOW -- IN THE SENATE,
WE NEED, UNFORTUNATELY, 60 
VOTES. 
WE HAVE 51 VOTES. 
WE NEED DEMOCRATS -- THEY WILL 
DO ANYTHING TO OBSTRUCT, 
ANYTHING TO MAKE IT AS 
UNCOMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE 
-- BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S GOOD 
POLITICS. 
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S BAD 
POLITICS. 
WE WILL SEE VERY SOON. 
WE'RE BUILDING IT. 
WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. 
THAT WALL IS HAPPENING. 
UNDER THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION, AMERICA'S RICH, 
NATURAL RESOURCES OF WHICH YOUR 
STATE HAS A LOT, WERE PUT UNDER 
LOCK AND KEY INCLUDING 
THOUSANDS OF ACRES IN SUPERIOR 
NATIONAL FOREST, YOU KNOW WHERE 
THAT IS, RIGHT? 
TONIGHT, I'M PROUDLY ANNOUNCING 
THAT WE WILL SOON BE TAKING THE 
FIRST STEPS TO RESCIND THE 
FEDERAL WITHDRAWAL
IN SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST. 
AND RESTORE MINERAL EXPLORATION 
FOR OUR AMAZING PEOPLE AND 
MINERS AND WORKERS AND FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, ONE OF THE 
GREAT NATURAL RESERVES OF THE 
WORLD. 
AND WE'LL D IT CAREFULLY AND 
MAYBE THEY FIT DOESN'T PASS 
MUSTER, WE WON'T DO IT AT ALL, 
BUT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, I 
WILL TELL YOU. 
AND IT'S HAPPENING FAST. 
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN IT, AS YOU 
KNOW, A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD. 
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE THINGS 
BETTER. 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT FROM AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT, 
BETTER. 
AS A RESULT OF OUR MASSIVE TAX 
CUTS, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE 
RECEIVING MUCH BIGGER 
PAYCHECKS. 
MUCH BIGGER. 
WE'VE ELIMINATED RECORD NUMBERS 
OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. 
BY THE WAY, SO A FEW DAYS AGO, 
IT WAS 500 DAYS. 
SO NOW IT'S LIKE 511. 
IN 500 DAYS, WE'VE CUT MORE 
REGULATIONS THAN ANY A -- THAN 
ANY PRESIDENT WHEN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S 
FOR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS OR IN 
ONE YEAR. 
IN ONE CASE, 16 YEARS. 
WE'VE CUT MORE REGULATIONS IN 
500 DAYS THAN ANY PRESIDENT. 
EVEN OUR 16-YEAR PRESIDENT. 
WE'VE OPENED UP ENERGY 
EXPLORATION IN ANWR IN ALASKA. 
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT 
FROM BEFORE THE DAYS OF RONALD 
REAGAN. 
COULDN'T GET IT DONE. 
WE REPEALED THE CORE OF 
OBAMACARE, THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE. 
IS GONE. 
SO UNPOPULAR. 
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WHERE 
YOU PAY A FORTUNE FOR THE 
PRIVILEGE OF NOT PAYING FOR 
INSURANCE, FOR HEALTHCARE. 
AND LET ME TELL YOU, WE JUST 
REPEALED IT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
PAY ANYMORE. 
SO BIG. 
SO BIG. 
AND WE WOULD HAVE REPEALED AND 
REPLACED OBAMACARE, ALTHOUGH 
WE'VE GONE A LONG WAY TOWARD 
DOING THAT ANYWAY, WE HAD TO DO 
IT ON A LONGER ROUTE -- BECAUSE 
WE HAD A GENTLEMAN LATE INTO 
THE MORNING HOURS GO THUMBS 
DOWN. 
THAT WAS NOT A GOOD THING HE 
DID. 
THAT WAS NOT A GOOD THING FOR 
OUR PEOPLE, FOR OUR COUNTRY, 
WHETHER YOU'RE DEMOCRAT OR 
REPUBLICAN. 
AND EVERYBODY SAID, OH, GOOD, 
WE HAVE HIS VOTE, WE HAVE 
EVERYBODY'S VOTE, WE WERE GOING 
IN FOR A ROUTINE REPEAL AND 
REPLACE AND HE WENT, THUMBS 
DOWN. 
NOT NICE. 
THAT WAS NOT -- WE ARE BRINGING 
BACK OUR JOBS FROM OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
WE ARE BRINGING BACK OUR 
COMPANIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. 
CHRYSLER IS COMING BACK. 
CHRYSLER JUST ANNOUNCED THEY'RE 
COMING BACK. 
MANY, MANY COMPANIES ARE COMING 
BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. 
THEY KNOW WHERE THE ACTION IS. 
THIS IS WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. 
AND AS FAR AS TRADE IS 
CONCERNED, WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES, WE WANT FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL TRADE, WE DON'T WANT 
STUPID TRADE LIKE WE HAD FOR SO 
LONG. 
STUPID TRADE. 
>> 
>> REMEMBER THE WORD 
RECIPROCAL. 
REMEMBER THE WORD RECIPROCAL. 
WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY 
ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH. 
OUR FRIENDS AND OUR ENEMIES. 
AND I HATE TO SAY IT, OUR 
FRIENDS TO A BIGGER AND BETTER 
JOB THAN THE ENEMIES. 
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 
AND EVEN BEFORE WE FINISH OFF 
WITH THE TRADE DEALS, AND WE 
WILL FINISH OFF WITH THE TRADE 
DEALS, PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WE 
HAVE THE CARDS. 
BECAUSE WE ARE THE PIGGY BANK 
THAT EVERYBODY WAS ROBBING FOR 
30 YEARS. 
WE ARE LIKE THE PIGGY BANK, 
LET'S GO GET SOME MORE. 
YOU LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
THEY PUT UP BARRIERS SO THAT WE 
CAN SELL OUR FARM PRODUCTS IN. 
AND YET THEY SELL MERCEDES AND 
BMW AND THE CARS COME IN BY THE 
MILLIONS. 
AND WE HARDLY TAX THEM AT ALL. 
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR CARS, AND 
IF THEY DO, THE TAXES -- TAX IS 
MASSIVE. 
THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING, WE'RE 
GOING TO SELL YOU MILLIONS OF 
CARS, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO SELL AS ANY. 
NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY 
ANYMORE, FOLKS. 
NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY. 
WE WILL NOT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 
OF ANYMORE. 
WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY, WE'RE 
GOING TO BE AN EVEN GREATER 
COUNTRY, HOPEFULLY GREATER THAN 
WE'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE. 
WE HAVE SUCH POTENTIAL. 
WE JUST SECURED A RECORD $700 
BILLION IN FUNDING TO REBUILD 
OUR MILITARY, WHICH WAS IN VERY 
SAD SHAPE. 
>> 
>> AND WE HAVE APPROVAL FOR 
NEXT YEAR, $716 BILLION, WE ARE 
ORDERING NEW PLANS, WE MAKE THE 
BEST IN THE WORLD. 
WE ARE ORDERING NEW SHIPS, WE 
ARE ORDERING NEW MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT. 
AND WE EVEN GAVE OUR GREAT 
WARRIORS A RAISE. 
>> 
>> GAVE THEM A RAISE. 
FOR THE VETERANS, WE PASSED THE 
LARGEST VA REFORMS IN HALF A 
CENTURY. 
A LANDMARK VA ACCOUNTABILITY 
LAW, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. 
YOU COULDN'T FIRE ANYBODY. 
THAT WORKED IN THE VA. 
THEY WERE SADISTIC IN SOME 
CASES, THEY WERE LAZY, THEY 
WERE THIS, LOTS OF DIFFERENT 
THINGS. 
YOU COULD NEVER FIRE ANYBODY, 
BECAUSE THE ACCOUNTABILITY, YOU 
COULD FORGET IT. 
SO WE PASSED A BILL THAT 
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO PASS FOR 
ALMOST 40 YEARS. 
IT'S CALLED VA ACCOUNTABILITY. 
WHERE NO YOU BRING THE PERSON 
INTO THE OFFICE, AND YOU SAY, 
JIM, I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU, 
YOU'RE FIRED. 
GET OUT OF HERE, BOOM. 
>> 
>> AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND 
I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE SAYING 
THIS SO SOON, BECAUSE I WOULD 
CAMPAIGN ON THIS, I USED TO GO 
OUT DURING THE CAMPAIGNS, AND 
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I WAS IN 
MINNESOTA A LOT -- BUT 
OBVIOUSLY ONE MORE TRIP, THAT 
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. 
>>  
>> BUT ONE THAT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT TO ME, AND I USED TO 
SAY TO MYSELF, I WONDER WHY 
DOCTORS DON'T JUST TAKE CARE OF 
OUR GREAT VETS. 
WE JUST PAST VETERANS CHOICE 
LEGISLATION, PAST, SIGNED. 
THAT GIVES OUR VETERANS THE 
CARE THEY DESERVE, THE CARE 
THEY EARNED, LOOK, SO OUR 
VETERANS WERE WAITING ONLINE
FOR NINE DAYS, FOR 12 DAYS, FOR 
THREE WEEKS, SOME WENT ONLINE 
WITH A MINOR PROBLEM, THEY 
ENDED UP HAVING A TERMINAL 
DISEASE. 
NOW, I SAID, DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN, BEFORE I KNEW TOO 
MUCH ABOUT IT, BUT THERE'S A 
LOT OF COMMON SENSE IN LIFE, I 
SAY, INSTEAD OF OUR GREAT 
VETERANS WAITING FOR TWO, 
THREE, FOUR, FIVE WEEKS, WHY 
DON'T WE LET THEM GO SEE THE 
DOCTOR AND PAY THE BILL? 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
THAT'S VETERANS CHOICE. 
THAT'S VETERANS CHOICE. 
AND YOU KNOW WHY I WENT TO 
PEOPLE -- I THOUGHT, OH, I 
THINK I'M SUCH A GENIUS, OKAY, 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS LIKE THE 
GREATEST IDEA. 
BUT I WENT TO THE GROUPS, 
EVERYBODY, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO 
GET THAT PASSED FOR 30 YEARS. 
OKAY? I 
DIDN'T KNOW THAT. 
BUT WHAT I DID KNOW IS I KNEW 
HOW TO GET IT PASSED. 
AND WE GOT IT PASSED. 
TWO WEEKS AGO. 
AND BY THE WAY, WE PASSED 
ANOTHER ONE THAT'S CALLED RIGHT 
TRY, YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT TO TRY 
IS? 
VERY PROUD OF IT. 
RIGHT TO TRY. 
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
TERMINALLY ILL, IT'S SAD -- 
THEY TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD 
IF THEY HAVE THE MONEY, IF THEY 
DON'T, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO 
DO. 
IF WE HAVE DRUGS THAT HAVEN'T 
BEEN APPROVED YET, BUT ARE 
SHOWING TREMENDOUS PROMISE, IT 
DIDN'T MATTER, IT DIDN'T MATTER 
HOW SICK YOU WERE, WHERE YOU 
WERE, YOU COULDN'T GET IT. 
AND THE REASON WAS, THEY DIDN'T 
WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S 
GOING TO HURT YOU. 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE AROUND 
FOR FIVE WEEKS. 
IN FIVE WEEKS, I KEPT SAYING, 
WHY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING? 
IF PEOPLE HAD THE MONEY, THEY 
TRAVEL TO AFRICA, TO ASIA, TO 
EUROPE, TRYING TO FIND A CURE. 
IT WAS CALLED HOPE. 
THEY WANTED HOPE. 
AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT. 
I SAID IT'S RIDICULOUS. 
I GOT INVOLVED -- AND THIS IS 
ALSO -- LIKE VETERANS CHOICE -- 
FOR MANY PEOPLE PEOPLE HAVE 
TRIED TO PASS -- AND KEVIN WAS 
A GREAT HELP, I HAVE TO TELL 
YOU, KEVIN McCARTHY, WHO JUST 
LEFT THE STAGE, WAS A GREAT 
HELP, SO WERE YOUR CONGRESSMAN, 
A GREAT HELP -- AND WE GOT 
RIGHT TO TRY PAST AND FOUR 
WEEKS AGO, I SIGNED FINAL 
LEGISLATION AND WE ARE VERY 
PROUD. 
AND MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
SAFE, MANY, MANY PEOPLE ARE 
GOING TO BE SAFE. 
AND YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE 
EASY BUT IT WASN'T, BE SURE -- 
BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES 
AND THE HEALTHCARE COMPANIES 
AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL 
COMPANIES, IT WAS INCREDIBLE, 
BUT WE DID THAT. 
AND NOW WE'RE BRINGING DOWN THE 
PRICES FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 
WAY DOWN. 
SO WE'VE MADE THIS INCREDIBLE 
PROGRESS TOGETHER WITH YOUR 
HELP. 
WITH THE HELP OF THE MILLIONS 
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT, 
WELL, SOME POLLS GOT IT RIGHT 
BUT NOT ALL POLLS GOT IT RIGHT 
-- BUT THEY SHOWED UP IN THE 
BEGINNING OF THAT NIGHT -- 
PEOPLE WERE SAYING, YOU KNOW, 
THIS COULD BE A BIG PROBLEM FOR 
THE DEMOCRATS. 
THEY WERE NOT LIKING WHAT THEY 
WERE SEEING, THEY WERE SEEING 
TOO MANY OF THOSE HATS, TOO 
MANY PEOPLE WITH -- YOU KNOW 
THAT. 
THAT ONE AS A MATE -- THAT WAS 
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE 
EVENINGS -- BECAUSE THAT'S A 
MOVEMENT THE LIKES OF WHICH 
THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN 
BEFORE. 
THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN. 
YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT THE 
FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN. 
THEY'RE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE, 
THEY WORK THE HARDEST, THEY PAY 
TAXES, THEY DO ALL OF THE 
THINGS, AND YET THEY WERE THE 
FORGOTTEN PEOPLE. 
BELIEVE ME, OUR PEOPLE ARE THE 
SMARTEST AND THE HARDEST 
WORKING, SMARTER THAN ANYBODY 
AND THE HARDEST WORKING. 
>> 
>> YOU KNOW, A LITTLE THING I 
WAS TALKING ABOUT TODAY, YOU 
EVER NOTICE THEY ALWAYS CALL 
THE OTHER SIDE, AND THEY DO 
THIS -- THE ELITE. 
THE ELITE. 
WHY ARE THEY ELITE? 
I HAVE A MUCH BETTER APARTMENT 
THAN THEY DO. 
I'M SMARTER THAN THEY ARE. 
I'M RICHER THAN THEY ARE. 
I BECAME PRESIDENT AND THEY 
DIDN'T. 
>> 
>> AND I'M REPRESENTING THE 
GREATEST, SMARTEST, MOST LOYAL, 
BEST PEOPLE ON EARTH. 
THE DEPLORABLES, REMEMBER THAT? 
THE DEPLORABLES. 
>> 
>> OH. 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> YOU KNOW, I WAS WATCHING, 
WHEN CROOKED HILLARY -- AND BY 
THE WAY, IS IT -- HEY, EXCUSE 
ME -- HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING, 
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING WHAT'S 
BEEN GOING ON WITH THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT? 
WHAT A SCAM THIS WHOLE THING 
IS? 
OKAY? 
HOW GUILTY IS SHE? 
>>  LOCK HER UP! 
>> WITH PETER STRZOK AND HIS 
LOVER LISA PAGE -- I DON'T THINK
THEIR WIFE AND HUSBAND ARE TOO 
HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
I DON'T THINK SO. 
BUT HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING THIS 
WHOLE SCAM? 
DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE 
SEEING? 
NO MATTER WHAT SHE DID, NO 
MATTER HOW MANY CRIMES SHE 
COMMITTED, WHICH WERE NUMEROUS, 
THEY WANTED HER TO BE INNOCENT. 
WITH ME, NOTHING. 
NO COLLUSION, NO NOTHING. 
AND THEY JUST WANTED TO TAKE 
ALL OF US, THEY WANTED TO PUT US
IN TROUBLE, AND IT'S NOT 
WORKING TOO WELL, I'LL TELL 
YOU. 
DISGUSTING. 
CALLED THE PHONY WITCH HUNT, 
PHONY WITCH HUNT. 
BUT YOU LOOK AT THE CORRUPTION, 
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE 
IT REALLY? 
TODAY MORE THINGS, THAT'S WHY 
THEY'RE BUILDING UP IMMIGRATION 
SO YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING 
ON IN CONGRESS, BUILDING UP 
IMMIGRATION, THEY DON'T WANT TO 
SHOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 
CONGRESS WHERE THIS WHOLE SCAM 
HAS BEEN REVEALED, SO THEY WANT 
TO STAY ON IMMIGRATION WHERE 
OBAMA HAD BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN 
ANYBODY, WHERE BUSH HAD 
PROBLEMS, WHERE OTHER -- THEY 
WANT TO STAY ON IMMIGRATION 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GO 
INTO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS, 
WHICH HAS TOTALLY REVEALED THE 
RUSSIAN SCAM THAT'S GOING ON. 
>>  
>> WHAT A GROUP. 
WHAT A GROUP. 
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, WE 
WANT TO GET ALONG WITH RUSSIA. 
BUT RUSSIA IS LOOKING OUT AND 
SAYING, MAN, I WISH SHE WON 
BETWEEN OUR MILITARY, OUR OIL, 
THAT WE ARE DOING -- SHE WANTED 
TO HAVE WINDMILLS, YOU KNOW? 
WE WANT TO COMPETE -- ALL THE 
THINGS WE'VE DONE, ALL THE 
THINGS WE'VE DONE -- INCLUDING 
SANCTIONS, SO MANY THINGS, 
THEY'RE LOOKING BACK AND 
SAYING, YOU KNOW, I WISH 
CROOKED HILLARY WON THAT 
ELECTION, WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT 
BETTER FOR RUSSIA. 
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE 
WANT TO ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS 
SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER ON ALL 
OF THE THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT 
AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, WE 
ARE GOING TO DELIVER ANYWAY. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
DELIVER. 
WE ARE GOING TO LIFT MILLIONS 
OF AMERICANS FROM WELFARE TO 
WORK, FROM DEPENDENCE TO 
INDEPENDENTS, AND FROM POVERTY 
TO PROSPERITY, WE ARE GOING TO 
LIFT THEM. 
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE GREATEST 
THINGS ABOUT ALL THE JOBS WE'VE 
CREATED, TO ME, THE GREATEST, 
IS THAT PEOPLE NOW DON'T GET 
STUCK IN ONE JOB AND THEY HATE 
IT, THEY DON'T WANT TO GET UP 
IN THE MORNING, THEY HAVE MANY 
OPTIONS, THEY CAN GO OUT, WAGES 
ARE RISING, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL 
THING TAKING PLACE, THEY CAN 
GET SOMETHING, I'VE ALWAYS SAID 
WHEN I MAKE SPEECHES ON HOW TO 
BE SUCCESSFUL, I ALWAYS SAY, 
THE FIRST THING, YOU'VE GOT TO 
LOVE IT, YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE 
YOUR JOB, THESE PEOPLE NOW THAT 
DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS, THEY 
WERE HANGING ONTO ONE JOB THAT 
THEY HATED, THEY HAVE MANY, 
MANY CHOICES, THEY GET THE JOB 
THEY WANT, AND FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN 20 YEARS, WAGES ARE 
RISING. 
WE ARE GOING TO BUILD NEW 
AIRPORTS, AND WE ARE GOING TO 
BUILD RAILWAYS AND HIGHWAYS. 
AND WATERWAYS ALL ACROSS THIS 
MAGNIFICENT LAND. 
WE HAVE SPENT, BECAUSE OF 
HORRIBLE DECISION-MAKING -- $7 
TRILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
THINK OF IT. 
7TRILLION. 
IF WE WANT TO FIX A WINDOW IT'S 
LIKE A BIG DEAL. 
$7TRILLION. 
IT'S ALL COMING BACK. 
REMEMBER DURING THE DEBATES I 
TALKED ABOUT GROWTH, GROWTH! 
WE NEED GROWTH. 
NOBODY'S EVER SEEN GROWTH LIKE 
WE ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW. 
WHEN I GO AROUND AND MEET 
FOREIGN LEADERS, THEY ALL 
CONGRATULATE ME, MR. PRESIDENT, 
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GROWTH 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
EVERY ONE OF THEM. 
FIRST THING THEY SAY, FIRST 
THING THEY SAY. 
>>  USA! 
>> BY THE WAY, IS THERE 
ANYTHING MORE FUN THAN A TRUMP 
RALLY? 
IS THERE? 
>> 
>> AND WE BREAK EVERY 
ATTENDANCE RECORD EVERY SINGLE 
TIME, JUST ABOUT. 
WE ARE GOING TO PUT NEW STEEL 
INTO THE BACKBONE OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT 
STEEL RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
WE ARE GOING TO BREATHE NEW HOPE
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR 
WORKERS ARE ALREADY SO PROUD 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL DO IT ALL WITH AMERICAN 
HANDS AND AMERICAN HEART AND 
AMERICAN PRIDE. AND EVERYTHING 
WE DO, WE WILL STAND UP FOR OUR 
CITIZENS, WE WILL FIGHT FOR OUR 
COUNTRY, WE'LL STAND UP FOR 
AMERICA AND WE ARE GOING TO 
STAND UP FOR THE GREAT STATE OF 
MINNESOTA AND YOU ARE SEEING 
THAT. 
YOUR GREAT STATE WAS PIONEERED 
BY MEN AND WOMEN WHO BRAVED THE 
WILDERNESS AND THE WINTERS TO 
BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR 
THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR 
INCREDIBLE FAMILIES. 
THEY WERE REALLY TOUGH AND THEY 
WERE REALLY SMART AND STRONG. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY,
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY, BUT THEY HAD GREAT AND 
THEY HAD FAITH AND THEY HAD 
COURAGE AND THEY HAD EACH 
OTHER. 
RIGHT? 
THEY WERE MINERS AND MINISTERS 
AND FISHERMEN AND FARMERS AND 
SHIPBUILDERS AND SHOPKEEPERS. 
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON. 
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES, THEY 
LOVED THEIR COUNTRY, AND THEY 
LOVED THEIR GOD. 
>> 
>> TOGETHER, WE ARE RENEWING 
THE MIRACLE OF THE GREAT 
AMERICAN MIDWEST. 
DO YOU REMEMBER NOT SO LONG AGO
, WE WERE PRODUCING THOSE CARS 
AND WE WERE PROGRESSING ALL OF 
THIS STUFF AND SINCE THEN, SO ú 
AND WENT TO OTHER PLACES AS I 
SAID BEFORE, THEY ARE COMING 
BACK AND THEY'RE COMING BACK 
FASTER THAN ANYBODY COULD EVER 
BELIEVE. 
WE ARE STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS
OF GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOTS. 
WHO PUT DOWN THE RAILROADS, 
BUILT UP THE HIGHWAYS, AND DUG 
OUT THE MOST AMAZING PANAMA 
CANAL, LOSING THOUSANDS OF 
LIVES IN DOING IT. 
THEY CROSSED THE OCEANS, 
TRACKED THE DESERTS, SCALED THE 
MOUNTAINS, CREATED THE MOST 
INCREDIBLE REPUBLIC THE WORLD 
HAS EVER SEEN. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
OUR REPUBLIC TODAY IS PROUDER 
AND GREATER THAN IT EVER WAS 
BEFORE. 
OUR BEAUTIFUL ANCESTORS WON TWO 
WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM, 
AND COMMUNISM AND PUT A MAN ON 
THE FACE OF THE MOON. 
AND I THINK YOU SAW THE OTHER 
DAY, WE ARE REOPENING NASA. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE GOING TO 
SPACE. 
>>  SPACE FORCE! 
>> SPACE FORCE. 
SPACE FORCE. 
SO WE HAVE THE ARMY, THE NAVY, 
THE AIR FORCE, THE MARINES, THE 
COAST GUARD, BUT WE HAVE THE 
AIR FORCE, NOW WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE THE SPACE FORCE, BECAUSE 
IT'S A WHOLE -- 
>> 
>> WE NEED IT. 
WE NEED IT. 
AS LONG AS WE ARE PROUD OF WHO 
WE ARE, AND WHAT WE ARE 
FIGHTING FOR, WE WILL NEVER, 
EVER FAIL. 
THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE OUR 
PLACE. 
THERE IS NO PLACE. 
WITH YOUR HELP AND WITH YOUR 
VOICE AND WITH YOUR VOTE, THE 
REPUBLICANS WILL WIN AND KEEP 
ON WINNING. 
WE WILL KEEP ON WINNING. 
WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND PETE IS A GREAT GUY, YOU'VE 
GOT TO GET HIM A VICTORY, GREAT 
GUY. 
GOT TO GET PETE A VICTORY. 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET HIM A 
VICTORY, WE NEED HIM. 
WE WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY FOR OUR 
MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY AND OUR 
MAGNIFICENT LAND, THE LAND THAT 
WE LOVE. 
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICANS AND 
OUR HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE AND 
BLUE. 
>> 
>> WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
AND WE WILL NEVER, EVER STOP 
FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
OR FOR OUR FLAG. 
OR FOR OUR FREEDOM. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, 
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER 
GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, 
MINNESOTA. 
THANK YOU, MINNESOTA.
