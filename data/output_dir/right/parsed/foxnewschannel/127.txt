SOARING TO $775 BILLION.
IS NOT END OF
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, TRY THE
OTHER END.
DISCORD IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
DON'T.
I'M A GUY WHO LIVES THERE.
PAINTED ON A LOT OF GUYS WHO
WORK THERE.
PUERTO RICO HURRICANE RECOVERY
EFFORTS THAT WERE ALL HIM WHEN
THEY WERE GOING WELL BUT THEN
NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM WHEN
HE DISCOVERED MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
GO TOO WELL.
IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO SHIFT BLAME
BUT IT'S SECOND NATURE TO THIS
PRESIDENT TO SHIFT SO MUCH
BLAME.
THE SHIFT HAS REALLY HIT THE FAN
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS
SHIFTING.
OWNING STRONG STOCK MARKET WAS
GOING ITS WAY ARE NOT PLANNING A
FINGER WHEN IT'S NOT GOING AWAY.
IF THAT IS LOCAL.
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT.
FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL IS
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE
ECONOMY.
NOT THE 0% INTEREST RATES THAT
THAT --
JUST LIKE IT'S NOT THE FORMER
PRESIDENTS BULL MARKET, IT'S
HIS, EVEN THOUGH IT STARTED MANY
YEARS EARLIER BEFORE HIS, IT'S
CLEAR THOUGH THAT MARKETS GO UP
AND MARKETS GO DOWN.
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT MARKET ON
THE TRUMP HAVE GONE A LOT MORE
UP THAN THEY'VE EVER GONE DOWN.
WOULD IT KILL THIS PRESIDENT TO
HEED THE WORDS OF ANOTHER
PRESIDENT WHO HAD ANOTHER MARKET
THAT WAS GOING REALLY DOWN.
>> ALL THE OTHER THINGS I'VE
TOLD YOU ABOUT THE ECONOMY ARE
AS SOLID AS I'VE TOLD YOU.
SO NO, I HAVE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE
OF WHY IT TOOK PLACE THAN YOU
DO.
>> Neil: IT'S TOUGH TO BLAME
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO BUT IT'S
TOUGHER TO TAKE A BOW FOR
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT REGRET.
JOHN KENNEDY --
COULD HAVE BLAMED HIS MILITARY
ADVISORS, EVEN HIS PREDECESSORS
THE BAY OF PIGS FIASCO.
IN THE END, AS PRESIDENT, IT WAS
HIS FIASCO.
>> VICTORY HAS 100 FATHERS AND
DEFEAT IS AN ORPHAN.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
INFORMATION IS -- IN REGARD TO
THE RECENT ACTIVITIES.
>> Neil: LESSON LEARNED.
THE TROUBLE WITH POINTING
FINGERS AT OTHERS IS THAT SOME
OF THOSE OTHERS FEEL TEMPTED TO
POINT A FINGER AT YOU.
WHY SHOULD I STICK VALUE IF
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO STICK IT TO
ME.
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LOYALTY.
IT WORKS BOTH WAYS.
TAKES A BIG MAN TO ACKNOWLEDGE A
MISTAKE BUT HERE'S THE REAL
DIRTY LITTLE TRUTH ON THIS.
THOSE WHO DO ALMOST ALWAYS SEE A
BIG JUMP IN THE POLLS.
WHETHER IT WAS JFK IN THE
BAY OF PIGS OR RONALD REAGAN AND
IRAN CONTRA.
>> I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MY OWN ACTIONS AND FOR THOSE
OF MY ADMINISTRATION.
>> Neil: OR BARACK OBAMA IN
HIS OWN MIDTERMS.
>> WHAT HAPPENED ON TUESDAY?
>> Neil: OR BILL CLINTON
ACKNOWLEDGING THE OBVIOUS AFTER
THE NEWT GINGRICH REPUBLICAN
REVOLUTION.
>> THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS
OVER.
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK CLINTON
WIDELY LEARNED YOU CAN SPITE THE
PARADE OR MAYBE YOU CAN TRY AND
LEAD IT, AND SO HE DID.
IT'S TOUGH WHEN THINGS DON'T GO
YOUR WAY BUT MR. PRESIDENT, THEY
ARE ONLY GOING TO GET TOUGHER
WHEN YOU KEEP PUTTING YOURSELF
IN THE WAY.
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH
BEING HUMAN.
THERE IS EVERYTHING WRONG WITH
TRYING TO CONVINCE OTHER HUMANS

LET ME PUT THIS IN TERMS OF YOUR
LEGIONS OF LOYAL SUPPORTERS WHO
NO DOUBT SHARE WITH ME RIGHT
AFTER THE SHOW IN FACT THEY ARE
DOING SO NOW, IT WOULD BE LIKE
ME BLAMING MY BEING A TAD
OVERWEIGHT ON A THYROID
CONDITION.
FAT CHANCE ANY OF THEM WOULD
EVER LET ME TRY IT BECAUSE I CAN
