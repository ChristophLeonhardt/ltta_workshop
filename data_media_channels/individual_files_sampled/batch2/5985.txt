we're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall that will include the wall now a lot of people don't know it but we've already started the wall we got 1.6 billion dollars and we've started large portions of the wall but we're going to need even the way we negotiate we're going to need more we're going to get more and we may have to do some pretty drastic things but we're going to get it that would be another hint at the government shutdown that was president Trump rallying supporters on border security tonight in Tampa we should point out as we always have to the president's border wall has not been started just repairs to an older section near San Diego president spoke for over an hour on a number of issues including the economy including his contention that merry christmas' is under siege no more including trade immigration the Supreme Court voter ID and shopping for food we believe that only American citizens should vote in American elections which is why the time has come for voter ID like everything else voter ID you know if you go out and you want to buy groceries you need a picture on a card you need ID you go out and you want to buy anything you need ID and you need your picture in this country the only time you don't need it in many cases is when you want to vote for a president when you want to vote for a senator when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman it's crazy that was the kind of thing tonight and during the rally the president also he preys on Republican congressman Ron De Santis who was running in Florida's gubernatorial primary with us to talk about it david jolly former republican congressman from florida represented the tampa metropolitan region he attended tonight's rally in tampa and now we can say among other things he's been to a trump rally also with us Lisa Lehrer national politics reporter for The Associated Press so congressman I am very anxious to hear your takeaway from your first Trump rally and chiefly what television doesn't convey about a Trump rally yes so I think some of the storylines for what we are used to perhaps the national story tomorrow is really the chanting and attacks on the Free Press and frankly your colleague Jim Acosta over at CNN a viral video that's now going around the real verbal assaults if you will to the press that was absolutely on display we also saw the energy in the crowd when Donald Trump would address immigration matters and frankly anti-immigration rhetoric if you will also mentions of Hillary Clinton excited the crowd all those bread-and-butter issues Brian what was most remarkable to me though and probably the thing that I will never forget and I am wrestling with tonight is how homogeneous the crowd was and we could decide whether or not we want to assign culpability to the president for cultivating a constituency that tonight was 99% working-class or is that a broader national conversation we need to have but I'll be honest with you and I got checked myself I asked friends and I asked other folks in the media look around how many african-americans how many black Americans do we see tonight and you could count them on one finger and some of them were specifically positioned for camera shots this was a white working-class audience to Donald Trump's credit that felt he was speaking for them not just to them but he was speaking to their anger that's the one thing I wrestle with look the Tampa Bay community is a very diverse community I represented a very diverse community I walked into a rally tonight that was probably the most homogeneous environment I've been in in decades I'm curious we're how many people recognized you obviously you're from there you're Republican but you've been highly critical of this president so I certainly received some criticisms from those who said I needed to be softer on the president I could also have a conversation tonight though about how different media platforms divide the information that we receive because longtime Republican supporters who have not heard some of my criticisms because of where they receive their news today they were not aware of my criticisms of the president and so they treated me as a friend but certainly there were those who wanted to know why I was there questioned my intentions look I was there out of respect for those who support Donald Trump I don't support him I remain a Republican and I was there to learn from those in attendance I leave tonight in a strong disagreement as I arrived but it was important that I did it well thank you for that assessment Lisa in many ways it was a standard Trump rally just when you thought he was on the edge of being Roosevelt e'en he talked about actually taking office and realizing he was president I made some notes here talked about Washington and he said I know the good the great people I know the scum so I figured okay so not so Roosevelt II in there did you hear anything new tonight that he may take out on the road I mean it mostly did as you say seemed like the standard Trump rally it continues to be striking to me how much the president wants to run on immigration in these midterms that it really is the central piece of his message and it's one that he believes rightfully so resonates with his base but I suspect what he may not be taking into account is it also resonates very strongly with Democrats so while driving out his base could help you know in the Senate map which is sort of tilted toward Republicans to begin with in the house it gets a little more complicated because a lot of the battleground is in these suburban districts and by continuing to talk about these divisive issues like immigration like the potential for government shutdown along with the you know never-ending series of news about the investigation you know about controversial remarks every one of those headlines is an additional shot of a Dharana adrenaline into an already energized Democratic grassroots so what we've seen is protestors have become volunteers are likely to become voters and that level of enthusiasm is something that scares a lot of Republicans particularly when they look at the map in the house hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
