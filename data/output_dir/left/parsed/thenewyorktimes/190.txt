For the past year, the special
counsel, Robert S. Mueller III,
has been examining
two chief questions:
ties between Donald Trump’s
campaign and Russia,
and whether Trump,
as president, has tried to
obstruct that investigation.
I don’t know if I can explain
it as well as I did before.
Like, the special —
the special counsel is this,
you know —
Robert Mueller will likely
reach one of two conclusions
about the president.
Either there is evidence
he broke the law
or not.
If Mueller has evidence that
the president broke the law,
he has a series of decisions to
make about how to move forward.
The least aggressive
of them
would be to try and write
a report that he would
hope would end up
in Congress.
Mueller could take a more
aggressive measure,
which the special counsel
did during Nixon,
and make the president
an unindicted co-conspirator
in court documents.
The most aggressive option
would be for Mueller
to try and indict the president.
But there are many obstacles
to that,
particularly a longstanding
Justice Department policy
that says the president
cannot be indicted.
Mueller cannot make any of
these decisions on his own.
It all has to go
through the gatekeeper,
in this case, the
deputy attorney general,
Rod Rosenstein.
If Mueller tries to indict
someone like the president,
and the deputy attorney
general, Rod Rosenstein,
says no,
it automatically triggers
a report to Congress —
a way of sort of
giving the process
additional sunlight
and oversight.
Rosenstein would have
to explain to Congress
why he didn’t want to go along
with what Mueller wanted to do.
Some experts believe that
Mueller may try
and indict Trump just to ensure
that it triggers
a report to Congress.
If Republicans
control the House,
they are not likely
to do anything
with information from Mueller
unless it is really damning.
If Democrats win control
of the House in the fall,
regardless of what
Mueller finds
there will be immense 
political pressure on them
to do something.
And if they get a report
from the Justice Department,
they will likely, certainly, take
impeachment seriously,
if not begin an impeachment
process against the president.
