so Travis I guess I'm a psychiatrist and I contribute occasionally to rebel and I haven't heard of your organization before but it certainly made a splash more recently maybe maybe start with just tell us a little bit about you specifically well I I formed this company penguin philosophy based on my own beliefs about the way the world should be and the foundational aspects of that is letting art and science be your fundamental inspirations in life and then you build from there and I think there are many ways that we can inspire the world with art and science and I think one of the ways is what we've been doing with these large-scale live long-form discussions about art and science and some of them we we go more down the science realm but I think this is an amazing time to be alive and it's it's becoming popular to think and I've been saying this a lot lately and that's only going to be I'm just amazing for our planet in the sense that once politicians start seeing that they should start be building platforms around science reason and and this popularity of thinking then I think we're going to see a much more progressive policies coming out of out of you know the front end of things what's your intellectual limbs or occupational background choice my intellectual background is basically I've always been a thinker and I spent most of my time thinking about performance in art when I was young so I was a I was an actor and in training to be a performer up until I was about 23 24 and then at the same time I was still I was taking masters philosophy courses and and different things that kept my teeth wet in philosophy and science but my I only did some some formal training in in science and philosophy but nothing of any notoriety so I'm I'm kind of a I'm also a pianist and I'm a self-taught pianist so I guess maybe maybe that's the best way to describe me when it comes to philosophy in science okay now I guess I've certainly noticed your organization from having some big-name contrarian sort of thinkers I guess tell me your attraction to to think is like say Sam Harris or Jordan Peterson and the like well I think the world needs people who are brave enough to discuss competing views in kind of the form that that I am presenting them in live onstage you can't take back a mistake that you've made when you're live in front of an audience it's just and and some people's brands just don't allow for it it's like Sam Harris's brand his audience they will not accept if he if if he doesn't think carefully and deliver something carefully whereas the jordan peterson brand it's like he can he can kind of ramble like like trump I mean trumps are horrible yeah not to say that Jordans like Trump but but that that sense of okay let's let's spit ball here and see where this conversation goes and and I'm gonna I'm gonna throw in some things here and see what y'all think even though it might be crazy but so I think finding heroes and finding people brave enough to get up on stage and who are great thinkers I mean being a great thinker is is is one of the main assets I look for when I'm thinking of who I want to put on stage together people who can reason on the fly people who have some competing ideologies there's a there's billions of people on that that believe in each of their ideologies so putting them together on stage letting them go to battle with their ideas I think is is important so you you got to find people like Sam like Jordan like Eric Weinstein who are able to do this live on the fly and and I don't think there are many of them that are as exciting as people like to ordinance and there's obviously a big demand for it and what do you make that your events are almost like you know rock concerts and and I noticed one of the pieces in Britain argued I asked the question about some of the public intellectuals the new rock stars tell me a bit about what you think the attraction is why are people so drawn to this now well I think like I said I think it's becoming popular to think and I think that's been pretty recent and it seems like when something big happens in the United States it tends to trickle out and and affect the whole world and something as big as someone like Donald Trump being elected into office I think to a certain certain degree a lot of people said okay that enough is enough we need to really start making making sure everyone knows that thinking is popular because we have a we we have someone in in the office in the US right now that that is a lack of thought has a lack of thought a lack of thinking and I think what we're seeing in these armies that are coming out into into these big arenas is that these are people these are I really think these are mostly centrist thinkers they're not they're not on the left on the right I think if you were actually to boil down to who they are they might identify with some of the ideologies more on either side but I think in the end they're they're judging each each statement on the statement an each idea on the idea and I I mean to me this is centrist thinking and you sit on the center and if and doesn't matter what someone's affiliation is what they're saying is either or not so I think you know I think is it harder to be on the center these days trips promoted I think it's it's whenever you you are trying to ride a line that isn't really popular it's it can be difficult I don't I don't think it's a popular thing to be a centrist and not to affiliate with a certain party in the United States and I think what we're seeing though is armies of people coming out and saying we don't care what's currently popular we think we want thinking to be popular and we want the the people running for office to understand that there is a large delegation of people here that value higher levels of thinking as opposed to just going with the idea that's going to get you the most votes and hopefully this catches on and we and when it comes to politics that that one day where we're evaluating are the people that we can't be voting for based on their what's coming out of their mouth not their party affiliation but one of the differences you notice I mean you're from Canada is that right yes what do you notice the differences I guess in the Anglosphere bathe the United States to Canada and you've been through Britain as well tell me a bit of the differences you've noticed and you're coming to Australia soon yeah I mean I I just I tend to notice a lot of cultural differences but I think everyone's struggling with the same problems everywhere it it's this problem of you know politics getting in the way of reason and this happens all the time it just it happened and and also this idea of PC culture this extreme left idea of political correctness to the sense that you can't even talk about certain ideas and and if you do you're gonna get thrown over the border and told to get the hell out so I think the way freedom of speech is being challenged in some countries and and this idea of safe spaces and all this stuff I I don't think there's any use for it and I think it's a global issue it's not just in certain countries I see you know I was I was sitting at dinner with some really close friends of mine the other night and some people naturally when they get together with me they want to start talking about philosophical things and so I engaged and and basically when I I was asked an opinion on something and I related it to you know a race issue or an issue in feminism and I was told because I appear to be white skinned and and I appear to be male that I wasn't allowed to have an opinion on it even though I've quite a learned opinion on some of these issues so you know these these are sexism and racism that we need so the chance that you're not white or male is that correct if you want to set up these social rules they have to apply also to the apparent white male it's like I but it was it was really interesting to me that that this is becoming popularized and and I and I tend to hang out with people that would probably identify more on the left and have you received some blowback then some of you some of your work sure tell me about that well I mean the most extreme aspect of this is the amount of death threats I receive I mean I death threats so I started this company you know wanting to promote science reason art evidence and things that we should value and you know about once we were what one year established was probably when I got my first death threat and this was after working with Richard Dawkins and and a couple other people that you know are heavy on the atheistic side of things and and on the science and reason side and this you know unfortunately in this day and age this upsets people enough to want to issue me a death threat but since Dublin in London like my death threat toll has increased by four times I was I was receiving I was receiving a death threat like you know once or every two weeks where someone would send something on social media like and what's the night room what are they angry about well it's it's hard to say like I don't have enough evidence to really tell what but I can just by the nature of some of these threats threading threatening to behead me cut my health these are so these are not be sort of anti like a you think it might be from a Islamic types fear well I think I think some of it stems from that and I've done a few podcasts where you know I've spoken ill of Muhammad and and and you know some of the doctrines and and obviously some of the speakers I've worked with have spoken a lot of ill about on those subjects so but it's not you know that's not to say that all these threats are coming from a seemingly Muslim person it's they very well could not all be that or or any of that it's like someone doesn't say I'm a Muslim and I want to chop your head off it's more like hey here's an old bio of you when you're an actor from online I see where your hometown is I see where your where you've been and you hang out in these areas so I'm going to be looking for you type thing so is that upsetting for you or you can brush it off yeah I mean the thing I hate about this whole thing like for me personally I chose to enter this arena and and to fight this you know war of ideas and but my family and my extended family didn't choose this so I mean it really hurts when anything's directed towards them or yeah and and if and then I do anything I can to to protect them but it's you know some people the way they grow up in the towns that they grow up in it's like there's no worries of security and things like this and then all of a sudden it's like then one person of the family decides he's going to wage this war of ideas on the world and and travel the world and do these live speaking events and attract all this attention to himself and then you know a lot of the people who lose out or need to you know change their lifestyle a little bit are the ones that had nothing really to do with it I guess from the same your speakers and look at and speakers are as you say Sam Harris Jordan Payson magic now was and Eric Weinstein they're all coming to Australia soon as well and I know they've been through other parts of Canada America Britain you've had a particularly strong reaction in Britain I've noticed I mean I guess from their talks and especially their interaction what are your some of the observations in terms of what they see as the West's biggest challenges at the moment well I think there is a lot of fear the most common fear I would say is when we start seeing vandalism destruction and I guess all around unreasonable behavior from this this kind of newly formed extreme leftist ideology okay and it's like and it's something that is pointed out often because there are there are many apologists for groups like Ann Tifa you know these these groups that are going around and vandalizing people's property who they don't agree with or they're showing up with air horns or they're vandalizing you know the places where these speakers are speaking or they're even going after the speaker's themselves it's like and there's a lot of apologists on the left that are okay with the actions of what these people are doing so it's easy to point out the the extreme right and say okay let's look at the Nazis and and and the white supremacists it's like okay we all know those guys are assholes it's like we all know that I had debate yeah it's not a difficult debate but what is a difficult debate for some people is that this idea of deep platforming where you know you'll have a speaker going to university to talk about ideas and it's the reaction is the antithesis of what I think to be the most constructive reaction for my sense you put the the bad ideas and the good ideas all ideas on a stage I'm 10 beeramid if you like this video
