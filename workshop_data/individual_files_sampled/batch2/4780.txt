well joining me now is Montana senator Jon Tester the ranking Democrat on Senate benefit Veterans Affairs Committee senator tester welcome to the show let me ask you you have been the point person for these allegations some of these are so troubling it's no longer a question of whether he's qualified to be a VA secretary these are questions are going to be about whether he still has a medical license if these allegations are true about opioids writing his own prescriptions how are you verifying all of these allegations well the fact is is that we've we got starting about a week ago Chuck we've got claims accusations that were made and we're following up talking to some 23 different people and there's more that come forth every day about some of the challenges that Admiral Jackson had as chief of the white house medical unit and when we're following up with them the reason that document was released is I talked to chairman Isaacson staff this morning my staff did and gave him a document that was pretty well scrubbed because we don't want to give away the allegations these are active service member or retired service members and they're very concerned about the ability to maintain their ability to work in the White House medical unit so once we gave it to them then we give it to other people and look you guys need to have it - well III guess that's my question are you comfortable that all of these allegations are true enough that they belong in the public arena yet or do you think some of these need to be run down and investigated before and corroborated before you release it to the public well the question is how do you corroborate it is it only corroborated with people coming out and saying yep I'm the one that reported this I saw it I think what we've seen is a pattern of problems that people deserve to know I know a lot of folks have said mainly from the White House is you know we shouldn't be doing this look it would be senatorial malpractice for not for us not to follow up on this issue and find out what kind of a person Ronnie Jackson is you know Chuck I've never done this before I don't know I just want to get the best person to run the VA it's possible because our veterans deserve that and if a guy comes in the VA secretary position with a bunch of baggage it's gonna limit his ability to do the job it's necessary to make the V all that can be first our retired service members these folks that have reached out to you and your staff and the committee when you've spoken with them is it always been with you have you had senator Isakson staff I mean has it been together have you been hearing these allegations okay look most of the work has been done by my staff I've had the opportunity to visit with some but certainly the majority has been done by the staff both sides and how much has your staff been working with Senator Isakson see when these folks come in to tell you their story is it both your staff and Senator Isakson staff receiving this information together not always not always but we've tried with the information we've got we've tried to share with chairman Isaac's of staff as quickly as we possibly can I really don't want there to be a lot of secrets out there johnny is a good guy he's a great person to work with I do not want to ruin that relationship in the least and this these aren't my accusations these are accusations by active and retired military personnel that have come to us we're just trying to follow up to make sure what's true and what's not as you heard right before we begin are any of you dr. Jackson is denying the most recent allegations have been put out there particularly about being involved in a car wreck let alone drunk driving are you are you at all concerned that you may have made public something that isn't true if it turns out not to be true well I mean I first of all I think that it is our obligation to come forth and be as straight up and as square with the American people and with dr. Jackson as we possibly can look if he were to admit to that he had be done the Secretary of the VA so I don't anticipate that he would on the other side of the coin am I a hundred percent rock-solid sure that he did this no but I've seen a pattern here that continues on and on and on and I think it's important that members of the committee see what the what I'm seeing and consequently once the members see it they're going to start into you and you guys are going to say what the heck's going on so we do what we do in my office and that is be as transparent as we possibly can it's what I've done since I got here back in 2007 all right let's uh what's a way forward here do you think this needs to be aired out in a confirmation hearing or do you think the White House should withdraw the nomination no I think we I think we need to get the bottom of it I'm still not confident that that Admiral Jackson is not confirmable on these grounds I think we need to get to the facts I don't think he could be confirmable oh I think there's a possibility he could be confirmable now he has some other issues other than these issues that I think both sides the aisle are concerned about about budget his ability to budget such a massive budget as the VA and yeah and his ability to to lead but some of these allegations go directly to his ability to lead and quite frankly that that's why we need to get to the facts let me ask you a question about whether dr. Jackson's been the subject of an IG report it's our understanding dr. Jackson said he was not did he deny being a subject of an IG report to you senator tester he has not denied it to me but I have seen parts of that IG report I've been very very busy today so I have minimal read through it all but he was absolutely a subject of an IG report him and his predecessor so and that I've seen some of those allegations it's my understanding that people said it was more about his predecessor than him is that a fair reading of that IG report or is it pretty damning on him as well I think it's then I think is equally damning on both of them very quickly on this confirmation on the confirmation issues as a whole you're not voting for Mike Pompeo you didn't vote for him for CIA so no one can say hey you're you said yes to them at one time no on the other but what is your line of deference to the president because if Mike Pompeo didn't get confirmed I don't think Donald Trump's gonna nominate a John Kerry for instance so what is your line there on deference to - - not consenting well look I had a good meeting with with director Pompeo and then I went back and read some of the things that he said in the past and I'm gonna tell you this is a guy at Secretary of State his job is to negotiate our way forward so we don't end up in war wars always got to be a tool out there that you use and negotiations I gotta tell you his past comments that he have made have been very troubling to me and and I think that that that peace and negotiations aren't his first option we've been at war for 17 years this this country is strapped because of it and and nonetheless I think it has to be a threat out there but you need to have a person in the Secretary of State's office this will initiate good faith for peaceful outturn alternatives in in crisis situation and gosh knows we've got a lot of them around the country there's a lot of things out there cooking very quickly I want to circle back dr. Jackson he's still confirmable in your eyes if he's if he answers these allegations to your satisfaction I think he's still I think there's still a potential of a confirmation hearing and a vote okay you said hearing in a vote that doesn't mean yeah you got the big chest ire cat smile on there is there any change I would vote to confirm him to be be a secretary you senator Jon Tester I'm not there yet we still have more work to do with the allegations that have been put forth in the claims and more scrutiny on his ability to handle a budget as big as our VA and the people under him senator Jon Tester Democrat from Montana ranking member and the VA committee thanks for coming on appreciate it come on a trapeze hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
