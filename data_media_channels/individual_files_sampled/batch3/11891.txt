hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle the Pentagon recently released its new Nuclear Posture review its critics are stunned not only the use of nuclear weapons is now more thinkable but also the threshold for their use has been lowered dr. Strangelove would be proud is the world facing another dangerous arms race crosstalking the Nuclear Posture review i'm joined by my guest michael Hamlin in Washington he's a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution also in Washington we have kevin kamps he is a radioactive waste specialist at beyond nuclear and in London we cross to add real Cassata he is a foreign affairs consultant and analyst alright gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate Kevin let me go to you first in Washington here I read the report quite thoroughly I was quite stunned as I said in the in the introduction I'll read you my three takeaways here the report exaggerates exaggerated spur sieve threats to the US number two it fuses conventional and nuclear war and pushes for the development of low-yield nuclear weapons I mean that's quite stunning if you look at the history of arms control oh and by the way it's gonna cost about 1.3 trillion dollars what were your takeaways from the report Kevin in Washington well I think your title for the show is very apt I mean Dan Ellsberg in his new book the doomsday machine confessions of a nuclear war planner said at the time that dr. Strangelove was released in the theaters in the early 1960s that it was nonfiction so here we go again we're gonna do this all over again a new arms race and that figure of a trillion 3 that's probably an underestimate anything that the Pentagon touches anything that the Department of Defense or Department of Energy touches the cost escalation factor should be referred to as going nuclear they often go over budget over schedule so what could we do with a trillion 3 in this country in the next 30 years infrastructure repairs paying off the national debt these are the kinds of things education Social Welfare that need to be taken care of well who not a new arms you know who knows that actually maybe a more in the in national interest in the national security than this new program let me go to Michael Michael you wrote her an article for USA Today Trump's plan for nuclear weapons make sense make your case real quick well first of all it makes some sense I agree with Kevin's concern about the money and in my article I did criticize the across-the-board modernization agenda which by the way is not new to President Trump President Obama intended more less the same thing and so and so in that regard I would like to see us prioritize things that we need for safety and reliability versus things that we need just to modernize the entire force the the nuclear weapons do need to be safe and reliable and I think we need the b21 bomber as well because we can use that for conventional warfare of the kind we see in the Middle East for example but I don't think we need to modernize the ICBM leg as much as the Pentagon believes and I don't think we need as much new capacity for nuclear warhead production so just to be clear the USA Today gave a more robust sounding title than I personally believe my view is more mixed on the review there are some aspects to it I agree with others that I think are excessive Adrienne London I mean I went reading the report it you know we always say you know you don't think the unthinkable but this is thinking the unthinkable and actually making it possible what and I'm saying first use of nuclear weapons under conditions against countries that do not have those kinds of weapons I mean that is really amazing okay and they throw in the cyber thing okay so one year ago Russia you know was tampering with a utility company in New England is the president the United States supposed to press a button then and then you find out it's just a fabricated fake story I mean I find this a trigger and this and this is what the nightmare of the nuclear age was all about is that who's got their their thumb on the button here I mean so somebody attacks his infrastructure and you use nuclear weapons is that rational go ahead Adriel no it's totally irrational in my opinion it is a precedent it is a precedent where for the very first time the America is explicitly is you know of trying to blackmail us and saying that it will use a nuclear response to non-nuclear attacks it is a you know is a precedent so when you when you look at the language how it you know it is created the this structure I mean in the sense of you know what sort of threats America has obviously it is exaggerating the nuclear power capabilities of of China obviously this whole report is aimed at Russia you shouldn't be you know look other way it is aimed at Russia is from the very beginning and we should know that even though that many you know proponents of Donald Trump were you know supportive towards him saying that oh he's the man who is facing obstacles in the White House he's trying to you know swamp the deep state or whatever no he's the man in the high house he's the man who's over there and even though that you know the the whole American system is broken it is a fact that it is you know disproportionate it is disproportionate how can you use the language of this sort of language I mean you know threats you know to defeat vital interest of the United States its partners and allies vital vital interests but what are these threats okay Kevin you know I mean I get one of the other things or is it it's really quite shocking is that using this smaller weapons in their in their capacity to destroy I mean but if you're on the receiving end of even it would say it's a it's a nuclear weapon half the strength Accord of this strength of Hiroshima but if you're on the receiving end of it you're not going to say well how should we respond because it was 25 percent of the the the grade that hid Nagasaki you don't think it no one thinks that way no one thinks that way if you're attacked with a nuclear weapon you're going to respond and you're gonna throw everything you've got because that's an existential threat what are these people in the Pentagon thinking and I want to talk about this guy a Keith pain about his article not in 1980 I'll ask Michael about that I'm sorry go ahead Kevin well George Shultz just days ago said a nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon so thresholds being crossed I mean I look at the report called nuclear famine by international physicians for the Prevention of nuclear war a Nobel Peace Prize winner that said if just a hundred Nagasaki sized bombs were exchanged let's say between India and Pakistan that was the case study it would cause a nuclear winter that would starve to billion human beings so these are not games to be played with abolition is where it's at the Nobel Peace Prize last December went to international campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons and the Hibakusha the survivors of the only explicit use of nuclear weapons in warfare from Hiroshima and Nagasaki we had better abolished these weapons before they abolish us Kennedy said that in 62 Kissinger said that ten years ago in an op-ed to The Wall Street Journal we are living on borrowed time ok Michael we have to remind our viewers that under international law first use of nuclear weapons is illegal okay unfortunately that wasn't even mentioned in the report okay I think it points out one of the people apparently from what my research is Kevin Payne president of the National Institute for Public Policy he was one of the drafters of this report and in 1980 I think was in foreign affairs he was - talking about winning and winnable nuclear war and I would like to put a quote here where it could be limited the casualties could be limited to a quote approximately 20 million people quote a level compatible with national survival in recovery when did in the world does this guy doing with this report well secretary Jim mattis is the guy who ultimately authored it and let me explain what I think his thinking was I understand by the way I agree with a lot of the criticisms we're hearing here about where the state of play is between the nuclear superpowers today it feels like it's a throwback it's very regrettable this is where we are but there is a sense and with apologies to Russian friends there's a sense that Russia has been really throwing its weight around in the nuclear domain violating the INF treaty I know we could debate whether that's true or not but I'm telling you the perception from the Pentagon violating the INF treaty having some new concepts like escalate to de-escalate whereby Russia would use a few nuclear weapons early in a war and try to prevent those from let's say these four scenarios those are scenarios coming out of the Pentagon I can tell you Russia's policy on use of nuclear weapons is very very clear we we had Russia's foreign minister come out and I will quote him entirely defensive scenarios and I'll give in there three of them in response to an act of aggression against Russia and or against our allies if nuclear or other types of mass destruction weapons are used and also third with the use of conventional arms but only in case our state's very existence would be in danger so I don't care what the Pentagon says in its report that is Russia's policy okay sorry you know it is ridiculous because most recently International International Institute of Strategic Studies think that based in London and that published the assessment of this review saying that they don't think that Russia is that stupid to use the nuclear weapons so I don't know what on earth and who on earth in Pentagon is having this assumption or is trying to portray or implement and you know persuade the public opinion that the you know the Russians or the people who are running Russia you know the barbarians the madman who is trying to subdue the whole world where in fact is all the way around okay Michael I interrupted you oh do you continue police well we do see Russia and military exercises that envisioned early use of nuclear weapons we do see this concept is really Italian and escalation let's be clear about that that is their military dock I don't think I'm okay listen I like the doctrine I'm not convinced however that it would always guide Russian behavior I want to get back to the world you're describing where the United States and Russia are both very clear that they don't view each other as adversaries and they don't envision you needing these weapons against reading that that's the world we should be reading that report is very adversarial I mean almost every few paragraphs it's very adversarial I mean I'm sorry Michael but it was directed against the United States in China okay ten seconds before we go to the break go ahead Michael it was directed against Russia and China you're right and and I agree that it's it's an unfortunate state but I think it was brought a bond brought upon largely by perceived Russian aggressiveness in this domain whether you agree with that perception or not that's where okay well we're gonna go to a break here but I like to point out to our viewers that it wasn't Russia that overthrew the legitimately elected government in Kiev in February 2014 after a short break we'll continue our discussion on the Nuclear Posture review stay with Artie welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter lamell to remind you were discussing the Nuclear Posture review okay Kevin I'd like to point out to our viewers you know this is a very heated here but this is a very important topic of course Michael did write something in USA Today but it's gotten very little coverage in on the cable stations which i think is really an indication of just how these kind of issues were taken out away from the public square' big I think people should be talking about these things there having said that Kevin it seems to me that there's some lessons being unlearned here and we called it mad mass assured destruction and it seems to me the US is unlearning that oh the major nuclear powers all understand that you know that's probably why they haven't been used okay since the first use by the United States at the end of the Second World War it seems to me the u.s. reading this posture is moving away from that again thinking the unthinkable go ahead Kevin well these are omnis idle weapons and here we are in the era of trump where you know christmas of 2016 trumps as macabre izinski flippantly let it be an arms race so you know no lessons are learned from history here it's fascinating how this goes back to World War 2 if you look at a book like gar alperovitz is the decision to use the atomic bomb a big part of the American decision to use atomic weapons in Japan in August 1945 was to tell the Soviet Union where to get off that the United States was in charge little did the u.s. know that the Soviets were just four years away from their own nuclear weapon because they had infiltrated the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in Montreal they had spies everywhere getting that information and then with the hydrogen bomb it was an even quicker turnaround between the Americans and the Russians we have to get over this American Russian Chinese thing these are ominous idle weapons we can wipe out our species as Dan Ellsberg warned in his book we're talking about in the late 1950s the ability to kill 600 million people in a short period of time those are the old days we're now talking about the ability to wipe out in full-scale nuclear war many billions of people very quickly and with nuclear winter that may take care of the rest of the human population so if we want to survive as a species we have to abolish these weapons it's as simple as that well I mean the United States is a member of the non-proliferation treaty and it is obligated to do that again that's not mentioned in the report at least that I didn't see it Hadrian let me let me go to you here I think there's something much broader going on here I think this posture is really all about how the United States sees its unipolar moment with the end of the Cold War shrinking that window is getting is closing and I think it is lashing out it's threatening it's saying that the that Russia and China are revisionist powers I have a hard time believing that both countries want to go back to the basic principles of the United Nations Charter okay as I mentioned before the end of the program the United States traipse around the world overturning governments and involved in seven different wars without any kind of United Nations mandate and they say that Russia and China are revisionist powers I mean that is like the the pot calling the kettle black go ahead Adrienne London this is this is simple Orwellian doublespeak from America you know I'm not talking about American people I mean I have many American friends who are you know intelligent people but when it comes to Pentagon and the upper echelons of of American political sphere and I get that sense and feeling that you know they are behaving like a spoiled brat who is dissatisfied with the fact that a lot of world is no longer looking towards them with that emphasis as it was before so with the attacks on Russia today with the attacks on Russia as a whole as a put that all on Putin on you know China it is emphasizing it is insecurity that it its values or its point of view can be challenged and this is the whole thing about multipolarity that you and I can you know go to the TV screen or whatever go to any country and get the source for ourselves to know the news and then assess them according to our knowledge and intellectual abilities but America doesn't want that and it's you know it is funny it is it seems to me as a grotesque as a person who was brought up in Poland that knowing that Radio Free europe/radio Liberty was the radio that you know our my grandparents or my you know my parents were listening you know but with their friends in some you know places far away from lot you know being chased by the Communists today I lived in Poland in the 1980s I remember all of that very very clearly well I only remember that from from my you know from my families you know stories that you know they were gathering in some you know distant places you know to be not caught it's like it distracted here Michael let me go to you I mean did you see any circumstances where the United States would resort to nuclear weapons over the some islands in the South China Sea or Poland or Ukraine excuse me no I don't however I can let me say one thing to frame a little bit of where this is coming from I understand why people who see Donald Trump and some of his behavior and some of his rhetoric would think of this in one way I want to underscore it was Secretary of Defense Jim mattis the document obviously it was world no we are narrowing the topic to Donald okay well Donald Trump okay because don't very very brief in my comment ok Michael very long go ahead you were very long in your comment go ahead my grief and mine my comment is Secretary of Defense Jim mattis is a very thoughtful guy and he's not going to use or recommend the use of nuclear weapons cavalierly and he does perceive a strong Russian assertiveness in the nuclear domain okay Michael so is madness is mattis bluffing is this a bluff then is this whole document a bluff to scare people it's partly it was no but it's partly psychological it is partly to point out to Russia that if they're going to be threatening with exercises with buzzing aircraft with doctrines or concepts the best way to deal or you can respond whose border Michael America's border on the on the eastern seaboard off of California is that that is that the border you're talking about you know my views on okay really I mean you know my views on NATO expansion I think it's gone far enough okay III agree with your concern that we need a new security architecture for Eastern Europe I hear your point on that issue but nonetheless it's Russia that's buzzing NATO airplanes that's attack you know airplanes buzzing Russia's borders you know if Russian planes to that on the same basis regular basis over New York what do you think the response would be it'd be outraged okay I've already had that Kevin let me go to you here is there gonna be a new arms race here because you know what the u.s. with this kind of document is what the third report this year about its posture it's all military it's all force it's all about hegemony okay is and you know because of the hostility that comes out of Washington towards Beijing towards the Moscow they will react that they was a u.s. one or an arms race then they'll get one okay what good does that do for the world go ahead Kevin right it will be an arms race Trump said let it be in our arms race let's spend a trillion three or more you know look how close we came you mentioned the buzzing of borders look at the Cuban Missile Crisis if not for vasili arkhipov on a Soviet sub against launch of a nuclear-tipped torpedo that the u.s. did not even know was there we we could have wiped out the human race in October of 1962 the man who saved the world it happened again in 1983 with stanislav petrov a Soviet nuclear commander who refused to believe the glitch in the computer that mistook a sunrise for a nuclear launched by the United States we have played with fire for 75 years with these nuclear weapons and if we continue to do this it's going to be at the end of our species that's what Beatrice Finn of the International Campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons warned just a couple months ago at the Nobel Prize ceremony we either abolish these weapons or they will abolish us that's what's at stake here Adriel one of the things that if we get these lower grade weapons don't you think that's going to entice countries for example of South Korea Japan Saudi Arabia I mean if you can play with little nukes okay that's not so bad okay I mean what is is it normalizes nuclear weapons for it's like a second tier powers I mean how does that make the world safer I can't understand it I mean maybe Brazil and you know Argentina will get in the ax - okay I mean the United States should set a positive precedent the only country in the world to ever use nuclear weapons against a civilian population a country that didn't have those weapons you're going backwards Adriel go ahead I mean with that recent move America just literally should hit self in the foot because as you've said it opened the opportunities for other countries still you know to say look if the Americans are upgrading themselves what about us there's no you know the safety any any more talking about you know North Korea and attacking North Korea with the mini nukes what doesn't mean mini nukes it is still in Luke is a still nuclear weapon so it it stills harms people who are over there so I will I will never you know be for this motion I'm strongly against using any type of nuclear weapons because as you've mentioned you know we we had our lesson I mean at least us you know my generation had the lesson from the Hiroshima Nagasaki so I don't want to see you know people in the Korea my contemporaries being you know so much devastated as the Japanese we're at that time so I don't believe and you know it's disposing at one serious question if America wants to lead the world what does it says there the hair moves the recent move moves and you know the actions towards upgrading I want to be fair I want to give Michael the last word here Michael maybe maybe the silver lining in all this is that maybe Russia China and the United States can actually sit down and maybe thinking about a new architecture for the use of these weapons maybe go ahead Michael yeah I hope so Peter I'm hopeful that we are actually at the worst of it now maybe even coming out of it and I do agree with president Trump's inherent instinct that us-russia relations should not be so bad and that we need a new approach unfortunately as you know we're still bogged down in the 2016 election debate here so it's sort of impossible in the United States right now to move beyond that at the moment but I am hopeful that we are going to be able to move out of that on the tactical on the issue of the low-yield nuclear weapon I think you were exactly right Peter earlier when you said there really is no meaningful distinction we shouldn't think these weapons are somehow more useable again if I want to interpret for you what I believe the Pentagon views as the reason for doing this they see that Russia has a lot of tactical nuclear weapons they don't want Russia to get the sense that somehow only Russia can engage in this kind of coercive activity and therefore we want to push bound that I'm hopeful that once we've done that and move on that we're a last point there we've run out of time gentlemen many thanks to my guests in Washington and in London and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember cross thought rules you
