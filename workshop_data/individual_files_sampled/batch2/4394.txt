begin tonight with another day of more falsehoods more fact checks and more contradictions all adding up to less credibility for the President and perhaps the White House much less here he is trying to clean up the mess his lawyer Rudy Giuliani made on the issue of stormy Daniels we're not changing these stories well this is where the narrator interrupts and says they did change their stories here's more for mr. Trump to be bringing up that kind of crap and to be bringing up witch-hunts all the time that's all you want to talk about you think you're gonna see excuse me but you have to excuse me you take a look at what I said you go back and take a look you'll see what I said excuse me you go take a look at what we said this is where the narrator says let's take a look at what you said and this is where the narrator says he does know because after Giuliani's gaffe revealing that the president repaid his personal lawyer for that hush money payment the president's own Twitter account we're not saying the president never does definitely typed this but his own account confirmed that he did know about the payment to stormy Daniels and he did know where the money came from because it ultimately came from him now it's a question of when exactly the president knew all of this and it's also a question of whether or not you can take Giuliani seriously because the president today suggested perhaps we should Rudy is a great guy but he just started a day ago he started yesterday he'll get his facts straight he's a great guy I will tell you this I will tell you this when Rudy made the statement Rudy's great but Rudy had just started and he wasn't totally familiar with every but you know with everything when he made certain statements he just started yesterday so that's it and this is where the narrator would say Giuliani did not start yesterday folks we've reached the point where the president is telling us not to believe his own lawyer but at the same time it's pretty hard to believe the president forget about stormy Daniels do you believe what he said today about being interviewed by Bob Muller I would love to speak I would love to nobody wants to speak more than min I would love to speak I would love to go nothing I want to do more because we did nothing wrong I would love to go I would love to speak but I have to find that we're going to be treated family barely and this is where the narrator would say he wouldn't love to speak with Muller let's roll the tape it is a fewer wit gun right now it's a pure wit gun this is a witch-hunt like nobody's ever seen before you have a group of investigators that are all Democrats in all fairness Bob Muller worked for Obama for eight years and this is where the narrative says the Russia investigation isn't a witch-hunt Bob Muller isn't a democrat and he didn't work for Obama for eight years so if it is hard to take the president at his word when he says any of that what do you make of this there was no collusion with the righteous there was nothing there was no abruption folks we reached the point where we asked again if the president's misleading statements matter they should but do they and to whom hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on youtube subscribe now
