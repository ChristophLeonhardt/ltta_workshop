just last month the administration said it knew just how to reunite immigrant children that they had ripped from their parents and then today they were proven wrong on that security set in June quote the United States government knows the location of all the children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families adding this process is well coordinated but in court today the government said it would fail to meet a Tuesday deadline to reunite children under five with their parents adding to the difficulty is confusion over how many children need to be reunited last week the government said there were 101 such children that's children under five in their custody take them to their parents then the number rose to 102 leaving one to wonder where did the other kid come from today the government said in six cases the adults of criminal histories were aren't really the children's parents as Vox reported the ACLU says there might be quote as many as ten additional separated children the government has not included on its list the government expects to reunite maybe half or a little more of those young children that's the kids under five by tomorrow's court order deadline we don't even know for sure how many older kids remain to be reunited because the government still will not say exactly how many children are in custody they took from their parents and that does not bode well for the July 26 deadline to reunite those kids up to 3,000 of them congressman dan Kildee a Democrat of Michigan visited a facility or some immigrant children are held last week he joins me here in New York tonight so the government basically said they have this court order that said kids under five there's about a hundred of them you got to reunite them in two weeks and then you have another two weeks to do the full three thousand right they're gonna miss the deadline they're gonna probably get an extension are you confident that they know what they're doing and they're trying hard enough I'm confident that they do not know what they're doing when I visited the facility in Grand Rapids Michigan I spoke to some of the caseworkers there who are responsible for managing these cases of these children they were spending time on the telephone calling every federal detention facility that they could find a telephone number for to try to track down the parents of the kids that are under their care they couldn't get the answer from the federal government themselves from the offices they were calling the detention centers to try to locate parents wait a second the que workers this is Bethany Christian services it's in Michigan right you visited there they have some tender raise children maybe a dozen or so kids under five yes so what you're telling me is those caseworkers are affirmative lis just cold calling detention centers attempting to locate parents it's not some central thing coming from HHS where they're making the matching no and I will say this that agency they're trying hard it looks like the kids are being well cared for privately they all of them said these kids do not belong here they shouldn't be here they should be with their parents I mean I I spoke to to the extent that I could with a little boy was probably three or four years old and when I walked into the room where he was sitting he looked up at me as if I wonder if this will be mom or dad okay yeah it just breaks your heart to see these kids torn from their parents they don't know where their parents are they don't know what's happening I worked in this field I worked in the child welfare system I know something about the trauma the children face who have been taken away from their parents I worked every day to try to get them back into an intact family in that trauma well they will live with that trauma for the rest of their lives in this case they were taken away from the one person perhaps that they knew cared so much about them that they were willing to sacrifice everything to try to save them from the violence that they were facing back home they were taken from that one person by the government the the worst thing about this entire story is that the Trump administration made this decision to separate these children as a tactic because they knew they thought it would work to prevent others from seeking shelter and asylum in the United States of America shame on them think about the morality behind a tactic to tear a children a child away from their parent because they think it might dissuade someone else from coming to the shores of the United States to cross this border to try to find some degree of security and safety for their children shame on them is Congress I mean here so I'm watching the government sort of say well we got it under control then doing a little high the the numbers and doing these court filings missing a deadline again this is 100 out of as many as 3000 right they can't make a 2-week deadline they get 50th is Congress gonna do anything about this well shouldn't there be something like very serious oversight being exercised right there should be and of course our visit to the Senate was one way of exercising that or said I will tell you it took a long time to be able to get that appointment scheduled and some of my colleagues now I saw that congressman mark de Sonia in California tried to get into one of these facilities was turned away we're not able to do our jobs and exercise oversight because the administration is telling these agencies don't let members of Congress in I feel like this is bipartisan at this point I mean there are like Republicans have been turned away as well and it seems to me that Congress should be holding hearings where HHS and where Nielsen and Azhar have to come before and actually tell the truth about what is going on absolutely and you know obviously one of the problems that we see is that the Republican leadership in this Congress I have their arms so tightly wrapped around Donald Trump's ankles that they will not do anything that sets him ankles Danka congressman dan Kildee thank you very much a few times hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC
