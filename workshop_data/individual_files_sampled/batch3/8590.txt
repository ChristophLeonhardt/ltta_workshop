ALL RIGHT. BRIAN? ANNA? BRIAN: STEVE A NEW STUDY FINDS THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN THE U.S. IS ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN WE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT BY A LOT. THE STUDY FOUND THAT 22.1 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WERE LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY OVER DOUBLE THE PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED 11 MILLION. ANNA: HERE TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THE NEW NUMBER ARE THE AUTHORS OF THAT STUDY PROFESSOR OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENGINEERING AT YALE UNIVERSITY AND JONATHAN FEINSTEIN. GOOD MORNING AND THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. GOOD MORNING, ANNA, HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR INVITING US. ANNA: I'M FINE. THANK YOU FOR ASKING. JONATHAN, I WILL START WITH YOU. HOW HAVE WE BEEN WRONG FOR SO LONG AND HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO STUDY THESE NUMBERS? YES, THE NUMBERS WE HAVE ABOUT 11 MILLION, ARE BASED ON SURVEY APPROACHES IN WHICH THEY GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND ASK INDIVIDUALS TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. WE LOOKED AT THOSE APPROACHES AND WE SAW THAT THEY POTENTIALLY WERE NOT GOING TO BE VALID. IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED TO RESPOND TO A SURVEY LIKE THAT. IT'S HARD TO LOCATE THEM. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A REASON NOT TO BE LOCATED. THEY MAY NOT ANSWER TRUTHFULLY ON THE SURVEY. WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND SEE USING A DIFFERENT APPROACH WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS WE GOOD AND IT TURNS OUT WE GOT VERY DIFFERENT NUMBERS. BRIAN: DID YOU LOOK AT BORDER CROSSINGS? OVERSTAYED VISAS? WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT? SIMPLE LOGIC IS WE JUST LOOK AT EVERYONE WHO IS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND SUBTRACT EVERYONE WHO IS LEAVING. SO COMING INTO THE COUNTRY YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. WE ARE LOOKING AT BORDER CROSSINGS. WE ARE LOOKING AT PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERSTAYING THEIR VISAS, THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN WAYS THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS COME IN. AND THEN LEAVING THE COUNTRY PEOPLE, OF COURSE, WHO ARE DETAINED AND THEN DEPORTED ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF THIS. ALSO PEOPLE LEAVE VOLUNTARILY. PEOPLE DIE AND SOME PEOPLE GAIN LEGAL STATUS. AGAIN, THE ESSENCE OF OUR APPROACH IS TO SAY WHAT WAS THE INITIAL POPULATION IN ABOUT 1990. WEE THINK IT WAS ABOUT 3.5 MILLION. YOU ADD EVERYONE WHO COMES. IN YOU SUBTRACT EVERYONE WHO GOES OUT IT DOES NOT INVOLVE ASKING ANYBODY ANY QUESTIONS. IT'S BASE WORKING WITH OPERATIONAL DATA. ANNA: SO, IF YOUR NUMBERS ARE CORRECT. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE PROBABLY NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE ARE DEALING WITH OUR PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. JONATHAN, HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU IN THESE NUMBERS? DO WE NEED TO DO MORE RESEARCH IN A SIMILAR FACE? WELL, WE CERTAINLY DO I WANT TO ADD AS WELL THIS IS A PRODUCT OF AMERICAN HISTORY, THE MODERN HISTORY STARTS IN ABOUT 1990. AND FROM THAT TIME TO NOW, THERE WAS A VERY LARGE INCREASE, WE BELIEVE IN THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS FROM 1990 INTO THE MIDDLE 2,000S. IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE SINCE 2008 THE NUMBER HAS ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE STABLE. WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY. BRIAN: RIGHT. BUT THE NUMBER KEEPS GOING UP, CORRECT, ED? ACTUALLY, IT'S BEEN QUITE STABLE OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. RIGHT, YOU ACTUALLY, JONATHAN IS RIGHT. THE NUMBER DOESN'T KEEP GOING UP. THE NUMBER HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FLAT SINCE ABOUT 2008 THE QUESTION IS WHERE HAS THAT NUMBER BEEN FOREIGN EMPHASIZE WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT THE POPULATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAS FACTUALLY DOUBLED WHAT WE'RE SAYING IT WAS HIGHER ALL ALONG AND UNDER ESTIMATED FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS. WE BELIEVE IT WAS UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE OF THIS SURVEY APPROACH. I WOULD ALSO ADD THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. BRIAN: YOU ARE TELLING ME WE ALWAYS HAD 22 MILLION ILLEGALS, THEY KEEP DYING OR LEAVINGOR GET NATURALIZED? NOT ALWAYS BUT FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS THE NUMBER HAS BEEN STABLE. 22 MILLION IS AN AVERAGE OVER MANY, MANY DIFFERENT REPLICATIONS OF OUR BASIC MODEL. THE NUMBER I WOULD SAY WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT IN IS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF 16.7 MILLION, WHICH IS 50% HIGHER THAN WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED. WE'RE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST THAT NUMBER. THERE EASILY COULD BE AS MANY AS 22 MILLION. IN FACT, THE YOU WERE ENDS OF OUR SIMULATIONS AS FAR AS
