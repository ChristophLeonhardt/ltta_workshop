president Trump's support base is not going to erode anytime soon while the media fulminated over Donald Trump Junior's reported meeting with then campaign manager Paul Manafort and from son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian connected lawyer in June 2016 and while they mock president Trump's overtures to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin they largely ignored the importance of one image and one image only for Trump's followers the image came on Saturday when President Trump approached marine one at the end was Air Force Base a strong wind knocked the hat off the head of a Marine standing closest to the staircase onto the helicopter because the marine could not move he was standing at attention Trump retrieved the Hat and put it back on the Marines head to have to off again and again Trump went retrieved the Hat this may have seemed like a big nothing to the left but it means a lot people on the right who filled the Obama White House routinely ignored the dignity of our troops President Obama brags openly about using troops as a photo-op he forced Marines to hold an umbrella over him as he gave a statement in the rain outside the White House he planned some friendly troops at pre-screened events and of course Obama's Veterans Affairs administration was a full-scale disaster the same weekend from help to this marine with the Tet we found out that 500 VA officials had been fired by the Trump administration for malfeasance and herein lies the point because our politics have become so little about policy and so much about intent Trump's most ardent supporters are never going to abandon him whether they believe that he's actually making America great again they think he wants to make America great again and they think Obama didn't want to make America great again in that assessment they're 100% correct but that also means that the media's attempts to play trumpet a nefarious Russian stooge manipulating the system to his own benefit that's going to fall on deaf ears Trump is seen by his supporters as it reactions the America last attitude of his predecessors supporters are not going to believe that Trump's america-first attitude is secretly Trump first video like the marine one tape reinforced the Trump support is that it believes that stuff so long as Trump continues to demonstrate his obvious reverence for American symbols it will be very very difficult for the left to carve into his base I'm here oh this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so welcome to our new Studios getting magnificences they are there's a whole other wall that you're not even gonna get to see yet but it's just amazing it's amazing it has gadgets and it's made of gold and they're dancing women and everything but you won't see that wall yet that's that's if you actually purchase the subscription any case we have we have lots coming up on today's show I want to talk about obviously the hubbub surrounding Donald Trump jr.

Madoff Orton mr. Krishna recently disclosed the meeting though no it's not its content and confidential government documents described to the New York Times so okay Trump jr. then makes a statement after this story breaks and he he originally had said there were no meetings with the Russians then he said well we did have a meeting with some Russian gal but it was really more about adoption policy than it was about anything else and then finally he released a statement late yesterday in which he said the reason that we met with this random Russian lawyer is because she promised that she had some dirt on Hillary Clinton right he actually admitted that so here is his statement Donald Trump jr. statement that he provided to ABC News late yesterday quote I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual where I was told might have information helpful to the campaign I was not told her name prior to the meeting I asked Jared and Paul to attend but told them nothing of the substance we had a meeting in June 2016 after pleasantries were exchanged the woman stated she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting miss Clinton her statements were vague ambiguous and made no sense no details or supporting information was provided or even offered it quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information she then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act that is an anti rushon it's a Russian sanctions Act it became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting I interrupted an advice from my father was not an elected official but a private citizen and that her comments and concerns were better addressed if and when he held public office the meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes okay so lots of open questions about this meeting okay then there are similar trick questions to be asked about this meeting first of all what you need to understand about this lawyer they met with is that the lawyer is very close with the Russian government so according to The Washington Post today they talk about who this lady is and essentially she worked closely with somebody who works with during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant so according to the Washington Post from junior's did not name the acquaintance who fixed up the interview but in an interview Sunday Rob Goldstone a music publicist friendly with the Crump jr. told the Post that he had arranged the meeting at the request of a Russian client and had attended it along with this woman whose name was a vessel it's gaia vessel and it's kaya okay so her client role okay this woman vessel Mnet's kaya her client role includes individuals and companies close to the kremlin she's for the past several years basically been a lobbyist for the russian government on the Magnitsky act Magnitsky act is a sanctioned series intended to rebuke russian for human rights abuses according to the post the acronym for Sergei Magnitsky a Russian lawyer who died under mysterious circumstances in a Moscow prison so basically the story is that somebody who Trump jr. knew from the 2000 Miss Universe pageant approached him said I know this lady that's on that's kaya and she has some information about Hillary Clinton that you're going to want to know and Trump jr. dragged metaphor and and Jared Kushner into the meeting and nothing came of it right that's sort of the the most innocent version of the story now there are a couple questions one did Trump jr. know that this vessel Mnet's kaya character was actually connected to the Russian government like where did he get information about her we don't know that yet we just don't know and one of the reasons that we don't know any of that is because nobody has been very forthcoming about it right we don't know if she's just a private citizen who's tight with the Russian government we don't know from junior knew anything about her he says he didn't know even know her name right he says I was not told her name prior to the meeting which begs the question why would you drag the three top officials in the Trump campaign at that time into a meeting two days after had secured the nomination essentially with a Rando right if I wanted to get a meeting with Trump jr. and and Manta Ford and Jared Kushner presumably it would be difficult for me to get that meeting like you have to make a pitch so what was the pitch the left is adjusting the pitch was somebody came to Trump jr. and said listen there's this lady who basically represents the Russian government the Russian government has dirt and this is the fulfillment of all the lofty dreams right that's the Pillman's of all the left you dreamed is that Trump jr. got Manta for dinner in a room all of them to hear dirt from the Russian government on Hillary Clinton that is not perfectly drawn yet right there is no evidence that that is the case yet because again we don't know number one how close she is with the Russian government this warrior and number two what they were told we just don't know right we'd have to actually get their emails or their text we'd have to get the phone call material leading up to the meeting to know how bad any of this really is but the left of course thinks this is a massive massive bombshell and they're playing it as such CNN is running with it of course unit is running with it because CNN only gets ratings whenever they talk about Trump Russia and they have something new to report so Michael Walsh over at the New York Post a guy whose work I think is pretty Hermus he has a critique of the of this particular story and he says so what races who wouldn't meet with a Kremlin connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign he says just as the Russian collusion fantasy a resentful smear cooked up in the immediate aftermath of Clinton's stunning defeat last fall was finally fading from the fever swamps of the resistance and its media mouthpieces along comes the time with a pair of journalistic noting burgers and he says that this is a nothing burger because no campaign in its right mind would turn down an offer of information on their opponent this is what Oppo research is all about you can bet Hillary wouldn't have hung up on the person who claimed to have dirt on the Donald okay so that's probably true but we would have cried bloody murder right if the Russians had approached Hillary Clinton says we and said we have dirt on Donald Trump and she had met with the Russians we would have said okay this is insane because obviously that's the quid so what's the pro quo right if you're handing information from the Russians what is the pro quo and you know Sean Hannity came out last night and he was tweeting about how all the could the Clinton said all these corrupt things and there were no consequences right and we all cried about it we said it was terrible so we can't have a different standard when it comes to President Trump so I don't really buy Michael Walsh's defense here you know again I think the best defense here is just ignorance as always the best defense here is ignorance which is why lawyers always tell people your first rule on the stand is I don't recall but we don't know enough for the suit to really go anyplace yet but the media is going to overplay it it's fascinating the way that the Republicans are treating this so Reince Priebus who's the White House chief of staff he's on TV yesterday and he made that he promoted the theory which had been pushed on a website called circa that Russian operative set up the meeting is basically a sting for Donald Trump jr. and Manafort and Kushner here's Bryon's cribs making that case on the January 8th edition of Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace asked Priebus point-blank does he accept that the Russians were behind this hacking campaign yes or not well sure I mean he's not denying that that entity is in Russia and it were behind this particular hacking campaign however the incoming White House chief of staff then seemed to place at least some of the blame on the Democrats saying we have the DNC as a sitting duck if the DNC allows any foreign entity into their system well voila now you have the biggest dissemination of emails that we've ever seen in the history of America previous was then pressed about who was really to blame and he admitted the primary actor is the foreign entity that's perpetrating the crime to begin with no doubt about it in the past Trump has expressed skepticism about Russian hacking claims at one point saying it's a very hard thing to prove while later calling it a political witch-hunt okay but then previous went on to repeat the Circa statement and that's the important part the circus statement was basically the Russian operatives meeting with Trump jr. and mana fort and Kushner in order to set up a Singh the problem is that were true why exactly wouldn't they just reveal that right if they actually wanted to get Trump wouldn't they reveal that somewhere during the campaign or now right the Kremlin is now denying this meeting ever took place so is this more smoke but no fire I think it is I think it's more smoke but no fire yet again I don't know why exactly top Trump campaign officials would be meeting with a Russian lawyer for a non nefarious purpose here but I'm not going to by Michael Walsh's routine either where he says who wouldn't meet with an Apple researcher claiming to have ties with the Russian government even if that were true okay in in 2000 Al Gore who is no Paragon of morality in 2000 somebody leaked the Bush briefing book the Bush debate briefing book - Al Gore and Al Gore's people promptly called the FBI ok so it's not true that everybody's engaged in this sort of stuff now again are the media getting ahead of themselves of course are they treating a meeting that had no actual outcome as the beginning and end of all things yes I mean even if all of this is true what we have here is a meeting that was failed right it's not it's not natural quid pro quo if there was not even a quid right if they didn't actually give any information to the Trump campaign then there's no information that the media is treating this as though a second step is guaranteed that basically the meeting happened Trump jr. and Nana fort may not have gotten anything but then that's where the coordination began but there's no evidence this is where the coordination began maybe it was a one-off maybe as the Russians trying to make a contact in order to muddy the waters we just don't know and so everybody is going you know over-the-top about a report I think that has very little substance to it as of yet well meanwhile you know President Trump isn't doing himself any favors with all of the of the Russia stuff so over the weekend there's a lot of talk about what exactly Trump had said in his meeting with Vladimir Putin Syria called late last week Trump met at the g20 with the Russian dictator and coming out of the meeting President Trump essentially said that he had gotten along well with Putin that Putin had brought up the election hacking stuff to Putin and that Putin had denied it and then he said we're going to move forward together he sends out a series of tweets on Sunday that through his entire administration and a bit of turmoil so it started off I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election he vehemently denied it I've already given my opinion okay so start with that he's already given his opinion so again his opinion is apparently that there was some Russian hacking but it also might've been the Chinese and a 400-pound guy in a bed somewhere so kind of unclear what he means by that then he says we negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives now it's time to move forward in working constructively with Russia but didn't stop there he continued Putin I discussed forming an impenetrable cybersecurity unit so that election hacking and many other negative things will be guarded okay so this is the this is a tweet to got everybody going was okay if Trump really believed that the Russians were behind the the election involvement and interference why is he forming a cybersecurity unit with them this is like marsh Clark says to OJ Simpson you're guilty of murdering your ex-wife and he says no no never Dennis you know what I'm going to form a joint task force with you OJ Simpson to go and track down the person who actually murdered your ex-wife a lot of people who are making fun of this yesterday as well they should because the idea of forming a cybersecurity unit with the people who are basically attempting to hack democratic institutions is really quite crazy and then Trump continues along these lines he says and safe questions were asked about why the CIA and FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their server and were rejected still don't and then he continues habit faking news said 17 Intel agencies when actually four you had to apologize why did Obama do nothing when he had info before election so all of this is if he's attempting to say I took election hacking super seriously and then I and then I put the screws to Putin this little tweet storm is not exactly it's not exactly assuring people it's not making people feel very reassured about all of us so you know he ripped Obama he ripped the fake news as for Putin he says I've already said what I'm going to say we're going to form a cybersecurity unit okay well there's a bunch of fala and then later that evening like 12 hours later Trump comes back with his final tweet right 12 hours later he comes back sanctions were not discussant in use - sorry along UN forces sanctions we're not discussing my meeting with President Putin nothing will be done until the Ukrainian and Syrian problems are solved so I'm not getting rid of any of the sanctions but I'm not increasing the sanction okay so the cybersecurity thing is what got people all hot and bothered later in the day he came back and he said the fact that President Putin and I discussed a cybersecurity unit doesn't mean I think it can happen it can but a cease fire can and did okay well I'm glad that he's coming to the fight though the right conclusion about cyber security but he sent all of his people out all day talking about how he was actually going to form a cybersecurity and it just shows that there's a bit of confusion at the top with regard to what President Trump actually believes about all of this and it isn't reassuring to people if you're trying to promote an image of yourself as a guy who is independent of Russia this is not the way to do it but I'll tell you what I think is actually really going on first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at car shield so if you are if you are on the road and your car breaks down it could cost you 100 even thousands of dollars to fix

to show so the media are basically trying to claim that Trump is a traitor they have been ever since Hillary Clinton was defeated and even before that they're trying to claim that Putin was was Trump's puppet master and Trump was the puppet and now President Trump should be drawing distance and in Poland he started to do that ready to give a great speech in which she talked about Western civilization and he talked about the importance of standing up to Russia in Ukraine and he called out Russia on Syria and then he has a meeting with Putin and it basically looks like he got rolled it looks like he came out and the only things that happened where he comes out and rips his own intelligence community he rips the media he rips the Democrats and then he's pretty kind of Putin he says will sign a cease-fire and then he says we'll have a cybersecurity unit where we cooperate and then finally does what we won have a cybersecurity that's kind of dumb it doesn't mean I think it can happen it can't really happen but we can have a ceasefire so we can still be best friends of course these sort of mixed signals do not assure now what I actually I want to tell you a little bit more than mixed signals but then I want to tell you what I think is actually happening here so first on the on the mixed signals Corey Lewandowski who of course is still close to president Trump there's talk about him reentering that the White House he's a former campaign manager for Trump he says listen the Russians say they didn't hack and so that's basically the end of the story what we saw yesterday and what's been reported yesterday is that the president took this directly to Vladimir Putin questions in if they were involved in meddling in the elections in any way shape or form and from what we're hearing the Russians have denied this but this is the type of president that takes a problem to lives it directly to the person who has the solution for it and pressed him very tough to find out if Russia had anything to do with the outcome of the u.s. election and for what Vladimir Putin has said the answer is no because that's mixed signals right so in court even while trumpeting I push Putin very tough would announce this is what Putin denied it I guess we're done here I guess we're done here nikki Haley you an ambassador she was on the sunday shows and she says precisely the opposite everyone knows Russian medals you know what I understand is that President Trump let him know that look we know you did this and cut it out and President Putin is never going to admit that they did it and so they have to come back and they have to defend themselves this is Russia trying to save faith and they can't they can't everybody knows that Russia meddled in our elections everybody knows they're not just meddling in the United States elections they're doing this across multiple continents and they're doing this in a way that they're trying to cause chaos within the country and tonight and I guess it's not a big deal right again these mixed signals are not useful to the Trump administration if you want them to get past all of this smoke and fire garbage then they need to stop sending mixed signals this way again Trump said that at the beginning of the day he said we trust the Russians and we wanted to December security in it with them and then nikki Haley goes on TV inches won't ever trust Russia it doesn't mean we ever trust Russia we can't trust Russia and we won't ever trust Russia but you keep those that you don't trust closer so that you can always keep an eye on and then keep them in check and I think that's what we're trying to do with Russia right now well no not so much that's it's not actually what's going on what's happening is actually some discombobulation in policy ash Carter the former president actually who's Secretary of Defense under Obama but well Obama was trotting around being an idiot ash Carter was actually trying to take care of defense he says that you know this idea of a cyber security unit is really done this is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary it's they who did this and so was it a mistake for the Trump administration to buy it well I don't think they can buy a we should that's that that can it's fine to talk to the Russians about lots of things it's never talking to people it's a matter of what you say okay so the new chunk bottom line is that this vagary is not paying off for president from now so I think there's something deeply nefarious is going on I don't and I'll explain what I actually think is going on inside from Ted and what I think is happening inside the administration but for that you're going to have to go over to Daley
