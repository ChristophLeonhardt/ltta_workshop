so there's an article on the daily wire yesterday about the former first lady Michelle Obama maybe you remember her she was at a some kind of Women's Conference and she was having a conversation on stage with an actress from the show black dish the actresses named Tracee Ellis Ross never heard of her but she's an actress apparently and the women were lamenting the fact that girls still dream of weddings and they still dream of Prince Charming this is a problem in the eyes of Michelle Obama this other woman the two agreed that some women Tracee Ellis Ross apparently included can sacrifice family for the sake of a career and for professional ambition and for success and be happy as a clam it's a perfectly legitimate fine great choice that a woman can make in fact it would seem that mrs. Obama who is married with two kids you may remember thinks that this path is actually preferable given the fact that she considers it a problem that girls aspire to get married and have kids she wouldn't call it a problem if a young girl said she wanted to grow up to be an astronaut or a CEO of a fortune 500 company that wouldn't be a problem but if a girl says she wants to get married and have kids and that's what she's dreaming of Michelle Obama's mind and in the minds of a lot of feminists and a lot of people in our culture that is a problem it's an it's an interesting thing because Americans are increasingly looking outside of the home for happiness they're there we have fled the home in search of happiness and in search of fulfillment and the people who have rejected family life for the sake of a job they'll say they'll claim that oh yeah I found it my life is wonderful I'm so happy in fact um Ross said she provided during this interview or whatever was she provided some compelling evidence to prove that her decision to forego family life for the sake of a job was the right call she said she turned to the audience and she said look where I'm sitting right because she's sitting she's on stage and she's sitting next to the former first lady which that of course is the peak and pinnacle of all happiness and so that proves that look my life is great wonderful I'm a 45 year old woman I have no kids I have no family but I my life is so awesome and we're always told this the the child free people are always telling us how wonderfully graded just awesome and exciting their life is which is the first hint that their life is not so great because when someone feels the need to constantly tell you their life is great and they're happy it means their life is not great and they are not happy and I am talking here specifically about the quote child free that is people who they don't say child lists they say child free because child list makes it sound like they're missing something child free makes it sound like a child is a disease that they're free from so I'm talking about the people who choose to forego family to forego kids for the sake of just a job and professional success that's what I'm talking about I'm addressing that because that is what Michelle Obama is pushing so what a lot of people are pushing in our society I'm discussing that I'm not talking about people who are not able to conceive children or people who are never able to get married even though they want to or they choose not to get married for the sake of some other vocation not discussing that I'm specifically talking about the people who choose this life of self-centeredness okay just to clarify here so you know who I'm talking about and the people who make that choice again they're all they're always insisting that their life is so great and it's just it's it's so it's so great in this it's just so straightforwardly great the way they present it is they never have any feelings of loneliness whatsoever none no it's awesome remember there's this you wait you may remember the Time magazine cover a cover story on Time magazine a few years ago and it was about cover about the child free life and there was a picture of these two this married couple smiling on the beach kicking back in the sand and they were you know they're just so happy and then the headline there said when having it all means not having kids and that's the way it's presented they have it all they've got everything and they're just happy laying on the beach and that is what the child free life is it is just a life on the beach no sadness at all it's utopia yet when I look around society I don't really see a lot of evidence of happiness I will in fact what I see is a depressed anxious stressed out nation of addicts and narcissists and people who are who compulsively stare at their phones and and watch TV their entire life is lived on screens and they're popping antidepressants I mean that's what I see when I look around I don't see this I don't see people who are living in bliss I hear sometimes people claim that they are and they present themselves as if they are on Instagram or on Time magazine covers or when they're giving interviews or when they're talking with the with with with a first lady onstage at a women's conference I could I hear that but when I look around I don't see any evidence of it I see a bunch of just zombies walking around who barely just confused and lost and feeling hopeless that's what I see and that isn't to say that all unhappy people are childless it's a lot of unhappy people with children what I'm saying is that we have a very flawed idea about happiness and our our concept of how you attain happiness which is in our minds you attain it selfishly through self-centered pursuits through pursuing things for your own sake that clearly has not worked out as much as we claim that it has worked out it hasn't we are more depressed and anxious now than we've ever been in history we're probably the most depressed anxious country in the history of the world and so obviously we're not going about things in the right way there's cot wit which is with everything about our modern attitudes and our modern philosophies there's constantly this disconnect between what is claimed and what is actually happening we're told that okay we adopt this philosophy this way of life and then X Y Z will happen but then I look around and X Y Z is not happening the exact opposite is happening now there are some studies that that will insist that people without kids are in fact much happier than people with kids if you google it right now I'm sure there are people furiously googling it so they can disprove me with science and they can leave a comments like no Matt scientifically you're wrong okay because science has measured human happiness and fulfilment and you see it's been tabulated here on this bar graph and obviously clearly you're wrong and if you google it you will find you'll see a headline saying that the people without kids are way happier way happier than people with kids there's a problem with these kinds of studies number one they assume an honest self-assessment the only way to measure someone's happiness is just to ask them are you happy with your life choices is your life it didn't you know are you happy with the path you've taken has it worked out for you do you feel fulfilled all you can do is ask them and it would require people who have sacrificed family for career it would require them to look honestly at their lives and at themselves and to assess it but most people don't have the courage for that so instead they'll just say oh yeah sure I'm so happy but they're not trying to convince us they're trying to convince themselves primarily the second problem is that a study you know these kind of studies they in surveys they assume that people have a correct understanding of happiness which most people don't most people don't know what happiness is so they don't know how to find it and they don't even they're unhappy but they don't even know that they are unhappy because they don't they don't understand what happiness is they don't in other in other words they don't know what they're missing they don't know what they could have and what sort of happiness in joy they can actually attain because all they've ever gone for is just this shallow selfish immediate kind of pleasure and indulgence that's all they've ever gone for it's all they've ever had so they say oh yeah well I guess that's happiness it's not it would be like if you if you wanted to find out whether or not whether people who exercise are happier or less happy then people don't exercise and so you go to a guy on a treadmill who's on like mile three of the treadmill and he's sweating and he's just he's exhausted and you go up and you ask him in the moment hey are you happy right now and the guy is uncomfortable and is in pain and he wants to get off the treadmill but he told himself he'd do five miles so right now in this moment he's probably not he would not self-identify as happy and then let's say then you you go and you'll find a guy who's sitting on a couch eating Cheetos and he's on our five of a Netflix binge and you ask him are you happy right now probably as he's relaxing on the couch and just sitting there on his butt he'll probably say oh yeah I'm so happy I'm just I'm relaxing it's great I'm happy does that actually prove which path brings greater happiness or does that prove that the guy on the couch is deluded and numb and the guy on the treadmill is working for something greater and bigger than what the guy on the couch is working for so maybe if you're doing your survey you should wait a couple hours wait till the guys off the treadmill after a day spent eating healthy and getting exercise after an active full day ask him then even asked the guy who spent all day watching TV as he's finally fading off to bed with his brain half melted ask him ask them then how happy they are better yet come back in a few years come back in a few years when the guy on the treadmill has been working out and exercising and and beating being healthy this whole time and now he's older buddy's in great physical shape and he doesn't have a lot of the health problems that people his age have and then go to the guy who's been sitting on the couch the whole time and he's overweight he's fat he's got diabetes let's do a comparison then to find out who's happier who chose the better path likewise I'd be interested to see a follow-up study with one of these happy people one of these happy child free people I'd be interested to see a follow-up study of a couple decades from now take some woman who shows profession career success over family over kids yeah right now when she's relaxing and she's getting ready from ready for her third vacation of the year yeah maybe she'll say oh I'm so happy check back in a couple decades when she's alone maybe she was married before but people who marry and choose not to have kids their likelihood of divorce is much much higher than people who do have kids so she's probably divorced by now and she's 55 60 years old she's on the tail end of her career a lot of her high-flying ambitions have long since given way to reality she's being replaced by younger more skilled people and she comes home everyday to her great wonderful nice house that the housekeeper has kept in great shape and she's got all this nice stuff there all this nice wonderful stuff but nobody there to use it and she's got all this space but nobody to fill it with at all these rooms but no one to sleep him and she could take any vacation she wants but she's been on all the exotic vacations they've lost their novelty by now and also frankly it's kind of depressing to go on vacation by yourself and most the people at work are much younger than her but the people that she knows her friends or her age most of them are there planning weddings for the grown children they're going to baptisms for their grandchildren they're planning family reunions they have all these landmarks coming up they've got the grandchildren coming over over on the weekend they're gonna go over a picnic they're gonna go down to the lake they've got this whole thing planned and her all she's got is herself or loneliness her success ask ask her then how happy she is and and and then maybe come back a couple decades from then which is elderly she's in a nursing home and there's nobody there to care for her because she never had any kids and so she's alone and then come back when she's on her deathbed and she's dying alone with nobody there to mourn because she has no family ask her then how happy she is she's leaving no legacy behind except for the work she did at some job some job that's long since forgotten her even if she had success she worked for a a great big company and she became a manager and she managed people she had an office she had everything I mean she was if she had an office Wow but that's not a legacy because she left that job and she was immediately replaced by someone else and the work she did just didn't matter that much that's the thing about a job about being an employee that's why it's so ridiculous for us to worship it as some great achievement you work at a job you can be replaced in an instant like that whatever your job is that's what I hate to tell you this I'm it's for true for me too whatever your job is you can be replaced like that and nobody will even notice maybe they'll give you maybe if you if you retire they'll throw a nice party for you if you get fired and when you're walking out the door holding your box of stuff maybe they'll say oh it's so we'll miss you I'm so sorry to see you leave they won't miss you by tomorrow they'll forgotten about you and things will just continue along without you it's different when you have a family they've got kids when you have a spouse you love you got grandchildren you've got a whole family you're not replaceable when you leave they mourn you something real is missing when you leave a job nothing real is missing there's no legacy it doesn't matter so ask her then how happy she is as anyone in the history of mankind is any dying person in the history of mankind ever lay on their deathbed and said to themselves I am so happy that I sacrificed family for material possessions has any dying person ever in history felt that way of course there are many people who do have kids and yet follow a similar trajectory to the one I've just described there are many people who have families and yet still sacrifice their families for the sake of for the sake of professional ambition and success and they're also going to end up alone and miserable because their kids were raised by TVs and by babysitters because both parents were out working ten hours a day to just amass all of this wealth and all of these possessions and all of this success and they feel like it's okay and their kids aren't missing anything because at least they can go on a nice vacation to Disneyworld once a year and they can buy them a lot of nice toys for Christmas and birthdays but in the end there the kids are being neglected and they're missing the one thing they really need which is a family which is parents who are there for them now I'm not saying there are people who or fall on tough Financial Times and so both parents have really have to work for the sake of in order to in order to make ends meet and they're just struggling and doing what they can there are a lot of people in that position and on some level the kids will you know maybe not now but at some age when the kids get older they're gonna look at that they look at their parents had to do struggling and fighting and they're gonna respect that they're gonna know that they were not neglected what I'm talking about which is very common especially an upper-middle class America I'm talking about families that are well-off and plenty of money one you know the the dad on his own is making plenty of money to care for the film but still both parents just go out and their primary concern is their careers that's the case and a lot of families for the parents that's the main thing they're worried about those are their priorities the problem is that the kids as they get older are going to realize that and they're gonna see that they play second fiddle to the stupid jobs that their parents have and their kids are going to grow to resent them and as those parents get older probably they're gonna divorce too because their priorities are out of whack and they care more about their jobs and they do about their families which leads to divorce it also leads to affairs and all kinds of things so most likely that marriage isn't going to last and both those parents are gonna end up alone as well and as they get older and they look back and they see all that time that was wasted and they see that now their kids are older now and don't need them anymore and they look back and realize that man all this time I could've been spending time with my family taking them phishing building treehouses doing all this stuff with them reading them books making memories I didn't do any of that and now they're going to want to try to forge a relationship and all of a sudden now become real parents to their kids but their kids are going to look at them and say it's too late for that we don't have any connection there's no bond there never will be you had a chance to build it and you never did you had a chance to be a parent and you never did and now you want to be a friend it's not going to work that way and so they're gonna be alone and they're essentially going to die alone too and the words that are said about them at their eulogies by their kids will be perfunctory and half-hearted as their kids struggle to conjure up any warm memories to mention in tribute to them you there's a lot of people in America who are on this path of just loneliness and disappointment because a lot of people have been made to believe that professional achievement is the highest goal in life it's the whole point of life to achieve professionally to have success that's what we think is the point but it's not the way that we find new if you really want to find happiness and fulfillment and meaning in life you don't find it through a job you find I know this sounds corny but it only sounds corny to us because we were silly and selfish people you find purpose joy and meaning in service to others service to God first and then to your family and then after that to neighbors and communities in that order everyone in the world is called to dedicate their lives to service everyone is called to that and only those who heed that calling will find any meaning any purpose any real joy in their lives and it is quite possible that you have people who are called to serve in another capacity there are people who never get married and so they you know they they enter into a different vocation and they serve in a different way they feel called to serve differently they enter into the religious life to become missionaries I mean whatever they but they serves through some other way there are people in that and that's a beautiful wonderful thing and those people will find meaning and joy and purpose in their lives and they're gonna leave behind a legacy and then there are married couples who can't have kids and so they become parents some other way maybe through adoption which is which is wonderful I also I met a married couple once who discovered that they couldn't conceive children and so they went over season became missionaries and became kind of spiritual parents to a whole host of people and they also are leaving a legacy they're finding meaning and joy and purpose in their lives and that's a great thing it is possible to have a family and not to serve it just as it is possible to not have a family and yet to serve nobody's suggesting otherwise I'm certainly not what I am suggesting is twofold number one most people are called to have Femmes and so it is objectively a bad thing that we treat family life as kind of this afterthought and the average age of first marriage for men now is like 30 and the average age of having a kid is going is being pushed back further and further it would be one thing if a few people if some people took that path and waited longer but when you get to the point where everybody is putting it off and waiting to start families until they're out of their young adulthood and out of their 20s that means that our priorities as a society our priorities have just been flipped upside down everything's been turned upside down because we're putting professional achievement and financial security ahead of femme so that's what I'm saying I'm also saying nobody is called to just have a career and to have that be their life because if you have no family or if you're married but you both work and you have no kids then your career is just about you it's just about sustaining you it's about money for you it's about achievements for you it's about success for you that's what it's about and you might say well I help people in my career I provide a product or a service or whatever great I mean really great that's that's awesome but when you go work a job the primary point is is the money you wouldn't do it for free right if you're doing something for if your career is something you do for free to help others well that's different that's a that's a ministry but most people their career is primarily they do it to make money for themselves they have a family they do it for their family but if there's no family they're just doing it for themselves and that's not a life that's not how that's that's not a life of meaning and purpose that's just a life about you American who says I'm putting off family for career or I'm not having a family because I'm focusing on my career the average person who says that it's not because they want to help people despite what they might say that are going to help people's because they want money for themselves and they want stuff for themselves they want nice vacations and they want to avoid the hassle and the hardship that comes with having kids because we've decided you know what we think is that finding happiness you find happiness through avoiding suffering and avoiding hardship and avoiding sacrifice and we don't realize that that's not where you find happiness you find happiness through hardship overcoming it in the midst of it that's where you find happiness so if you spend your whole life trying to go around hardship and sacrifice you're gonna miss it because it's right there in the middle you've got a plunge in and find it so that's where you find happen it's not and in look if you don't have kids we'd all have a family then there are things you can do that those of us with with kids can't do as much you can go on nice vacations and everything but even that even that is empty and meaningless if that's all your life is you know I have the opportunity as part of my job to travel all across the country when I'm doing speaking gigs and I see lots of different sites and it's great but when I go and I'm by myself and I'm in some new location seeing some beautiful view or making some great memory you know it's the first thing I always think to myself is man I wish my wife was here man I wish my kids were here to see this and to share this memory I can appreciate the thing on my own and I do but how much greater would it be if I could share it with the people that I love how much greater is the happiness when you share it you how much greater is happiness when it's not just about you there's a reason why a lot of people who in our society who have families and have kids will still report that they're miserable and it's awful and they'll complain about it because even though they have families they're still selfish people and they're shallow and they're cowardly really so they're not able to find a happiness that isn't about them but the real happiness and family life and it is a real happiness you find that when you're not looking for when it's not about you you find it in the moments that are not centered around you you find it in the moments that you give to your family into your spouse that's where you find that real true happiness but if you never give yourself to them if you never give them any time if you never sacrifice anything for them then you're never gonna find the happiness and family life you're going to miss it there's a movie called into the wild about Christopher McCandless a true story and he was the guy he left society behind he burned his driver's license credit credit cards he walked across the country on foot ultimately into the Alaskan wilderness wilderness by himself and when he made it there to this beautiful place he accidentally ate poison berries and he ultimately died alone out in the woods and as he was dying he scrawled a message for whoever would find his body and the message said happiness is only real when shared and that is a profound truth if your whole life is about making yourself happy you will never be happy not a real happiness the real happiness is that which is shared the happiness you find in family life is complicated difficult challenging even painful but it's real it's real and it's worth it and I really pity those who forego it for the sake of mere selfishness now even more pity those who have the opportunity to experience that happiness because they have families yet they miss it because they can't stop looking in the mirror what a waste I mean what an utter total waste watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
