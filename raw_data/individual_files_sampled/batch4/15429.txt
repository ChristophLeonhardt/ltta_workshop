remember mark Bray the Dartmouth professor who donated half of his book sales to an Tifa he's one of the violent vigilantes group most illustrious defenders in academia but in a recent interview he admitted that he doesn't even know what fascism is check it out the irony in academia doesn't get much richer than Dartmouth professor mark Bray who is a historian of human rights and terrorism and supports the antifa is that enough hypocrisy for you no well Bray confessed that fascism you know the thing that makes the difference nowadays between you being able to speak unhindered and you getting punched in the face by an edgy and artist manchild fascism apparently doesn't have a hard definition defining fascism is notoriously difficult because fascists have adopted and discarded ideas and positions more readily than perhaps any other political tendency fascism rejects rationality and ideological consistency said braids too far left outlet truth out aptly named because truth is apparently outside its capacity he notes it has reactionary and authoritarian tendencies but also says it might make more sense to talk about spectrums of the fascistic are you sure you didn't mean spectrums of the autistic mr. academic anti feh I hesitate to confine fascism to an abstract analytical definition continue spray definable Nietzsche argued is only that which has no history while I may not go that far I agree with a historian Angela tasko that to understand fascism we must write its history well we all know how post modernists define history they use feminist author Grace Lee Boggs definition history is not a past it is the stories we tell about the past morphing history from fact into fabrication something you can spin to fit your narrative fascism black of a hard definition allows antifa to apply the word to anything and everything they deem problematic once a target has been branded it's ready to be punched pepper sprayed perhaps smacked with the bike ball his brace see what he's doing perhaps he doesn't he does after all seem to have the same glasses as Toronto's proudest to export shanty Binks a radical feminist affectionately known as big red a petty superficial critique okay maybe a little bit but feminist problem glasses have become a bit of a meme for the figurative marks tinted lenses of doublethink through which social justice warriors see the world slavery is gone yet sysm is more rampant than ever compassionate liberals who are supposed to ease oppression ignore radical Islam the greatest modern oppressor of women in gays and violence is a perfectly reasonable response to wrong opinions don't forget Brahe is so radical even Richard Cohen president of the far left Southern Poverty Law Center disagrees with the professor's encouragement of antique avaya lence to silence of fascists it's likely to drive the people who are trying to censor underground where they may resort to illegal means to express themselves like bombs the historian Bray seems to forget one crucial lesson from history when people can't use words they use weapons for campus unmasked I'm Rob schrab Jacque if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
