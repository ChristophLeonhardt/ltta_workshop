welcome to The Young Turks I was almost gonna say in damage part yeah because that makes sense but you know like for real it's not like I was being sarcastic but Wednesday's this is the damage report line exaggerated up but right now the Young Turks we've got all the Young Turks II and sorts of things that you have come to love and expect we're gonna talk about Cavanaugh obviously there are so many updates that we have to go over both in terms of what the investigation that is now being reviewed by the Senate actually included and also little indications of how the vote that's gonna happen in the next 48 hours might actually go down but beyond that we have got a report from inside an ice detention center of horrific conditions actually conditions of I would say a life and death sort that were to be talking about the EPA loosening regulations on like I'm not ending that sentence there you would never be able to guess what they want you to have more of in your body it's like something out of a comic book will explain that a little bit later on and then rebel HQs emmav England has gone to another Trump rally that is always fun she asked them this time about Medicare for all very interesting responses from them to close out the first our FEMA is doing very important work for you all you know she goes and she asked the right questions and it has this calmness about her and there was she does and ask the right questions in response instead of just a normal oh well that's what the pulse of the American people are saying it's what the Heartland is saying and the Heartland said so so it makes sense yeah and it's look it's not easy I I wouldn't want to do it so more power to her this is what she is amazing at is going to that sort of environment and so we're going to show quite a few of the videos from that but Jr's gonna join me in the first hour in the second hour where we're gonna have an Rodriguez and Nana Vela are gonna be joining us for another full hour great stories there we'll give you a little preview of what to expect a little bit later on the show before we get into the prepared material though I saw something and I just want to briefly go over it Bernie Sanders we know is a is a good person no not just you know he seems like a good person also you know the things he's accomplished like with Amazon helping to pressure them to raise them in way jury but he's like almost kind of like a superhero and the reason is this story I just saw from Business Insider so Amy Corrado was on Capitol Hill as yesterday and she was walking around and as many young people are she was an early petition was going on and she started to walk into a busy intersection now thankfully there was a good Samaritan nearby who yelled ma'am ma'am get out of the road the voice better it was Bernie Sanders and was stopping her from walking right into traffic she says that she stopped I did not immediately get off the street even though there was a ton of traffic because I was in awe to see him looks like an angel had come down and you just can't stop but looking at it and he like tried to continue to bring her on the side work saying ma'am you've got to get off the street you've got to get off the street which she did not to save her life but to take a selfie with him and then liked with Clark Kent he immediately bolted towards the Senate afterward as people started to notice and a crowd started to come around who added the Clark Kent part you okay yeah yeah but like as soon as people noticed that he had saved this woman he ran to the Senate with Zack to the telephone booth how is this real okay I'm okay everyone talks about how you know the old man tendencies of Bernie Sanders I must be all of them because I would have been barking at what are you doing you stupid young person you say that stuff wait that's not necessary just save your life and that's what he did hey right through it she would I want to shoot I would have gotten her attention she'd have got another road I would have saved her life too I just would have done it with a lot less class mhm but the job would have been handled yeah and I would have told him what do you like seriously you sitting on a curb now scared no I'm not taking a picture with you no get up and go back to work what's wrong with you I think we've learned a lot your phone's down about Bernie and about jail anyway good job Bernie Sanders thank you for saving that life hopefully if he becomes present he'll have an opportunity to put policies in effect it will say penny more also just talking about me no you haven't done anything to deserve no credit okay let's jump into the important news of the day as we speak senators and a limited number of aides have a limited amount of time to look at the one copy of the finished EV bi investigate there's one printed up document in a very secure location that they can go into for a very short period of time and take a look at it there's gonna be no leaks you and I will probably never see what is in that document but we can sort of get an idea of what's in it from what different people are saying so the White House initially last night said they were very pleased with what was in it and what wasn't in it and that is based on not looking at it for even a second like with all of Donald Trump's book reviews that he tweets out he didn't read it but he also doesn't care and he doesn't need to see it there's also people like Lindsey Graham who said that they're not going to read the entire thing because they already know how they're gonna vote obviously but I want to talk about the actual conduct of the FBI what was investigated what wasn't investigated there were concerns along the way that the investigation was being purposefully hamstrung and its scope was limited both in time and you know how many people they could talk to that was how they announced it remember last weekend was that it would be limited in scope but they haven't liked the media attention around that they want the aura if not the reality of having an actual substantive investigation designed to get to the truth and so a president Trump has insisted publicly that he was not curtailing the inquiry but privately the White House restricted the FBI from delving deeply into Cavanaugh's drinking in high school in college and exploring whether he lied to Congress about his alcohol use according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter and beyond that there were many other limitations on the investigation first of all the Senate Republicans have tried to distance themselves from these concerns about too much control being put over the FBI saying that they haven't provided any sort of limited list of who the FBI can talk to and they should have communicated that with the White House though because the White House came out and said that the Senate had given them a list of four witnesses that they wanted the FBI to talk to and that's it and wait until you hear who was and was that on that list of witnesses because here's the thing this is about a sexual assault accusation it's about more than one but it's primarily about one and there's the accuser and there's the accused and neither of them were interviewed for this because apparently during the of course the the testimony that went down last Thursday I believe was yeah both got to speak so then they said we're gonna submit that into the record the FBI hasn't anything to do with it but actually during that entire time that was that inquiry or that testimony was conducted by senators from both sides Ohio of course some that were in support of Cavanaugh and it happens vice versa ones that were in support of Cavanaugh the questions weren't really questions when they got to talk to him and also when when dr. blase Ford was there the questions were conducted by the special investigator or the prosecutor all right yeah so that was that was taken care of in that way that's not the FBI that's not their expertise many Staters don't have any expertise for anything they gotta be honest instead of being politicians because their staff does all the work so when you have that that scenario where they're there to ask both of them questions and that's we're gonna submit to the FBI what would we need the FBI for anyway yeah so if I see a crime happened or I think I saw a crime happen am I qualified to go and conduct investigation or do I call the police and say you guys should conduct this investigation about how my car got stolen or should I go out on the streets and start trying to find someone who stole my car and conduct investigation no it's not my place yeah that's for the authorities to handle well look that's one angle the other angle is if you're accused of a crime and you're worried about you know perhaps cracking under the questioning that you might face just for court a selfie video of you talking about what happened and as long as you've got that why should any experienced interrogator actually talk to you it's ridiculous of course it's ridiculous Republican senators don't mind they think it's perfectly fine because they don't want any additional information every bit of information that has come out since this FBI investigation started has hurt Cavanaugh's credibility and so they don't want any more Republican voters don't care at all because they've never been interested in the actual facts of whether Kavanaugh assaulted Kristine Blasi Ford and honestly more importantly and perhaps more scary they don't care either way whether it happened or didn't happen they don't find that to be something that should disqualify you from being on the special course there was something else that I thought if you do fine you have their submitted testimony their sworn testimony from last week now if the FBI in FBI and Terry each of them you might have some discrepancies in their own stories that's the first thing I thought I was like well of course you're gonna be the first two players in the whole scenario first then if there's any discrepancy discrepancies in their stories you're thinking oh what point were they not telling the same truth who knows again if you're looking for the truth maybe the accuser is the one who's not telling the truth to the FBI don't you want that answer butch what that dad to interrogate her and ask her the same thing that she was asked no for not interested so her lawyers have put out a statement saying that this is it cannot be called an investigation since it didn't interview her nor the witnesses that they put forward who could corroborate her testimony they're profoundly disappointed and they should be because they had between eight and twenty depending on who you talk to witnesses that they said could corroborate what happened 36 years ago the FBI talked to literally none of them they were not interested that is there's a similar sort of situation with some of the other accusations so Deborah Ramirez they did actually interview that was the second accuser but all of the various people that say that they can corroborate that at the time they knew that Brett Kavanaugh had done what Deborah Ramirez alleges she did they did an interview because they don't care mark judged they talked to our judge but did they go and talk to the supermarket that she says she saw him working at that could sort of hone in on exactly when this alleged assault happened no they didn't do that and apparently were barred from doing it so again the Senate Republicans and the White House want to say that they're not you know getting involved in this they're not limiting it but that is what actually happened in terms of the witnesses and in terms of what areas of investigation they could actually go into I want to give you a little bit more information about what the FBI could have gotten from some of those witnesses that Deborah Ramirez suggested one has gone forward and gone public I should say because he tried to get in touch with the FBI and the FBI would not return his calls this is Kenneth up hold this is one of Brett Cavanaugh's college roommates he was alluded to in a Cavanaugh's testimony there was talk of some sort of issue with a third roommate and that was supposed to mean that what he had said didn't matter but he has a lot to say about what Cavanaugh said in that testimony and the actual veracity of it appaled said that he was 100% certain that he was told that Cavanaugh was the male student who exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez he said that he never discussed the allegation with Ramirez whom he said he barely knew in college but he recalled details which he said and eyewitness described him at the time that match Ramirez his memory of what happened he says specifically I can corroborate Debbie's account I believed her because it matches the same story I heard 35 years ago although the two of us have never talked so if the fallback is that this is some sort of political vendetta something something Clinton's and they're all working together he says he didn't know her then he doesn't know her now but he knows what he heard at the time so again they will say no evidence no corroboration they're not interested in the evidence they're not interested in they won't get any corroborating evidence evidence if you don't ever get the evidence but you ever get the accounts and again yeah sure many people could be lying that's why first of all you need more than five days it wasn't even a week first off you need more than five days to collect information that then compare it to other information from other folks again he said he didn't really know her that well but he'd heard about the stories there's multiple people who said they'd heard of the story again versus what judge Cavanaugh said in the hearings last week saying you know if something like this had happened it had been the talk of campus I'm not sure if you're gonna get to this but one of those people did say I heard him say that and I was like actually this is in the 80s in early early 90s late 80s where something like this happens you don't want it to be the talk of campus you kind of keep it on the hush you go man that was kind of uncomfortable I'm not sure if I should say anything because there's no one to say it to again the title nine things weren't put in a place where you have someone to report this type of stuff we talked about the changing of times and out things things were different then no it wouldn't have been that way because that's the way things were well there was at least a little bit of talk cast up hold was involved in that talk absolutely it'll stay among interested people and if you talk to those several people you might get some evidence that it all makes sense someone who never talked to one person or another or even the potential victim herself and say you're not have heard about that I was even there yeah they the FBI like we cannot overlook this they talked to nine people total there were five people at that first party there are at least four accusers plus Cavanaugh that's five they only talked to nine people there are literally a couple of dozen people they could do that in a couple of extra days I know that the thing is no no you guys just want to delay delay delay it's like 48 extra hours you can't do that to get to the truth we're talking about a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court he will rule on hundreds of cases that will have far-reaching consequences in every area of policy and we can't afford like a three-day weekend added to this investigation to I don't know actually talked to the guy being accused of multiple sexual assaults that is ridiculous hey people go to for minor crimes go to jail and wait if they can't make bail we know how that system works if they can't they sit there for an undetermined amount of time but while our judicial system gets things together and put together some way to prove or disprove or he tries to each has proved himself innocent or so you know he's supposed to consider that in the first place but that that process takes some time so again for a lifetime appointment you don't have the time to wait or to figure this whole thing out to put it in place what are you in a rush for what's the big rush is he is the lifetime appointment gonna is there an expiration date on this nomination process are you worried about something else do you know that there's there's a potential for more and more information about this person that come out that the public will know that they really don't want to be heard yeah like all the evidence leads to them wanting to cover things up if it was a transparent feel to this tone to their approach maybe people might believe you when you say I've known judge Kavanaugh for 25 years you've never do this sure well let's find out I haven't known him for five years and if you do rush then maybe we'll get to finally find out in this country what it's like when you impeach a Supreme Court justice that'll be an exciting time buckle up so Lindsey Graham is an open-minded guy who just wanted to get to the truth if I know what's in the report now the report is out and here is what he thinks about it I'm confident the FBI did a good job they were not hindered in any way the focus of the background check was on credible allegations before the committee I was looking for certain things to be answered by witnesses I'm more confident than ever that what the committee found is held up and then the main thing for me is that you need to go to the FBI and you need to ask them did they feel like they were able to do their job without interference and I think the answer is yes the senators who requested the Supplemental FBI background check got what they requested and I am ready to vote yeah he was ready to vote before that was absolutely full of lies obvious demonstrable lies but it's Lindsey Graham so what do you know time that was when it was 11:50 4 a.m. Eastern I think they they began looking at it 8 a.m. in the shifts we talked about not Chuck Grassley a one of the process to be kept in so they would they would make sure that there was no leaking because maybe some politicians from whatever side want to leak what they saw to the public and they want to keep it under wraps so for each party they'd have to view the important one hours shifts and the document would change hands parties change hands between the parties each hour it's been so from 8 a.m. to almost noon they'd had almost four hours and he's already giving interviews tell me how Sheree is or what happened and he's ready to vote I wonder how much he and I staff actually looked at those report that before it I mean do you think he looked at it maybe he went in the room with it I doubt he cared to actually look so look we have a little bit more video but I think we should make two things clear here based on the reaction of many Republicans to this report and not just the Republicans but also their supporters because I've been seeing a lot of conversation the right-wing pundits the regular right-wing voters talking about this two things have become very clear the first having to do with the Republican senators is do you remember back before the FBI investigation in fact before Cavanaugh and Ford testified at all there was the doppelganger theory going around or the Ed Whelan I guess there was just a guy that looked a lot like Brett Kavanaugh in the area who tried to rape Christine Blasi Ford those were theories that were laughed at however flash-forward a week or so that is what every Republican senator that is so far on the record saying they will vote for Brett Kavanaugh obviously believes is going on because they continually say she is credible we believe that she was attacked but we also believe Brett Kavanaugh he didn't attack her so somebody back in 1980s who in that area that look enough like Brett Kavanaugh that she has been fooled this entire time into believing it was him tried to rape her so in one week we moved from crazy conspiracy theory that has laughed that across the internet to every Republican senator believes that this is literally what happened and they're willing to put some on the Supreme Court because of it here's the reality because the reality honestly is is they either don't believe her or they don't care that it happened or they don't care yeah yes maybe I'm wrong maybe that's the best-case scenario from some of things the worst-case scenario is that they think that sexual assault not so bad the second thing this is I guess something that that women this country probably known for a long time guys are waking up to it we are not so different from other parts of the world where women's testimony is considered to be at best a fraction as valuable as that of a man they continually say there is no evidence that any of these things happen that means that all of these women what they are saying means absolutely nothing there needs to be a man who says she is right there needs to be a man that was there if Mark judge doesn't say that she's telling the truth her testimony amounts to nothing it is like the despotic regimes that we mock for not having the enlightened view of women and equality that we have here and yet when it comes time for a situation like this we treat women exactly the same sure sure you believe that you were raped okay maybe you were raped maybe someone tried to rape you but it certainly wasn't him he's powerful he's conservative he's ending up on the Supreme Court he's my friend and he's my friend and so yeah yeah I'm sure you believe all sorts of things happen to you honey but they didn't actually happen maybe if Mark judge said that you were you were telling the truth maybe he's a conservative man maybe we believe you then but not in this case so that's a this is a dark thing that I've had to realize about how our legal system works and again it is the 50th thing that confirms why so many women did not feel comfortable for the entirety of their lives coming forward because they won't be believed it doesn't matter how much detail they have they don't it doesn't matter how many witnesses they have you will not be believed the president might go to one of his rallies and literally mock you so the tens of thousands of people will laugh at your pain and the people who didn't like it we know we know we talked about it yesterday the people who didn't like it what Trump did at the rally like oh that's despicable disgusting divides he's such a horrible guy when it comes to their stuff and then we stop talking yeah what's the rest of the thought it's like so you have a disgusting horrible divisive person that you're supporting it's all you've done is point out who you're supporting and what their characteristics are yes all you've done yeah so look I wanted to play the videos of Raj Shah as deputy communications and he was saying yeah all these these concerns about drinking no they weren't investigated you know why because the only people that wanted that investigator were Democrats and they're not going to vote for them anyway this entire thing has been as partisan as any nomination process for a Supreme Court justice has ever been ever and to me it shows that we need to not just get past Kavanagh yes hashtag cancel Kavanagh but beyond that we need to fundamentally change the way we put forward Supreme Court justices the lifetime appointment process there are reasons why it was initially instituted the idea was that it would insulate the justices from political pressure it would take some of the partisanship out of the court does anyone feel like it's actually accomplishing that in the modern day exact opposite the exact opposite but it certainly comes with a lot of negatives and we are seeing that on a daily basis right now as we go forward in this process we need to fundamentally rethink how we put people in the Supreme Court how long they serve on the Supreme Court etc okay why don't we take our first break we come back some predictions as to how this might actually play out we're gonna go to some of the Senators what have they been saying about what came out of the FBI investigation after this we hope you're enjoying this free clip from The Young Turks if you want to get the whole show and more exclusive content while supporting independent media become a member at TYT comm slash joined today in the meantime enjoy this free second welcome back to The Young Turks everybody John I rolled it Jared Jackson shank is out and as well but they will be back don't worry and a little bit later on we're gonna have another panel for you for the second hour should be awesome you guys have been sending in comments I'm gonna read some of those in a second before we do that did you know that the internet is not always a secure safe place no I there are dishonest people on the internet who want steal your information steal your identity I saw even Facebook is having some it's lately look obviously we joke but we cover a lot of things like that and the internet does have a lot of insecurity a lot of potential threats which is why a lot of savvy Internet users use some form of VPN now if you're gonna use a VPN why not use a secure versatile VPN that is why we have partnered with Nord VPN there again incredibly versatile they have thousands of servers around the world you can connect up to six different devices so you have your own device versatility as well it uses military-grade encryption I don't even know what that means but if you're gonna have encryption probably go with what the military uses and also not that expensive because if you go to North Vee PN comm slash tyt or use code tyt today you can save 66 percent and browse you know with a feeling of security so do that now let's see what you guys have been saying to us Gabi Morita referencing the the talk we had about the investigation says what the trouble administration calls an investigation I'd call a cover-up I would call it that as well senator I think was Menendez said it's BS the investigation all he said he said the full thing eclectic miscellanea who I believe has a member content in every episode of The Young Turks these days says a sexual assault investigation that doesn't even include the victim pretty much sums up what the Republicans think about women's rights and that's true and every like basically every Fox News or other right-wing conversation about this is primarily focused on how a life has been destroyed Brett Cavanaugh's there's not even empathy for the victim let alone justice well the the feigned empathy is when they say the real culprits here I think Lindsey Graham said it's multiple times the real corporate here outside of the the judge is dr. Blasi Ford because they used her so they're both victims of this Democratic plot yeah here I would say to be fair you can either put this multiple sexual assault accused guy on the Supreme Court or pretend that you're the actual one who cares about the victim how about choose one of those two things Lindsey Graham by the way I also just want to thank all the people who protested today at the heart Senate building they took over the atrium they're pressing for senators to stop Cavanaugh from getting on the Supreme Court there were so many activists there which is absolutely awesome I saw to some celebrities got arrested Emily Ratajkowski and Amy Schumer were the very least detained during this as well as many other people and so as always thank you to those of you who are not only staying invested in what's going on this country but getting out there and getting active to try to have your voice be yeah do the officers actually target people that they recognize first or probably avoid yeah they recognize I mean generally when they they're locking up people it's just they're sweeping over a bunch of me bliss so I don't think that they go out of their way necessarily and generally like I we had Piper Perabo is on the damage report when she was arrested I think 60 people were arrested so they they really browned about them okay let's turn now to the Future the vote for Brett Kavanaugh to potentially get on the Supreme Court looks like it's gonna happen in the next 48 hours it doesn't look like there's much at this point that's gonna stop it but do they actually have the votes and we have a little bit of information I'm gonna start now with the Democrats you might think we know exactly how they're gonna vote obviously they're not gonna put this crazy right winger who's been accused of multiple sexual assaults on the Supreme Court but know we've got some red state Democrats so you never know however some of them have come out and said like Heidi Heitkamp said this isn't a political decision if this were a political decision for me I certainly would be deciding this the other way I can't get up in the morning and look at the experience I've had and say yes to judge Cavanaugh so Heidi Heitkamp who is actually in a very tight Senate race in a red state right now says she is not going to vote for him so that is good news it's joe Manchin at this point I don't know okay so we know how politicians think and every time it's about getting reelected reelect to be elected many of them have backgrounds as a turn I think probably is significant like majority of them probably I feel like every one of them or doctors or whatever else business then but so the worry about making sure that you're gonna did you're getting reelected no matter what when you're supposed to go there and represent your people or at least do something that's based on your principles that you probably ran on I don't understand the the obsession with making sure you're gonna get it so I get your only job or even the best job you've had or highest paying job you ever had in your life that you can't do something else if you stand by your principles you vote and make sure you do things that the American people want and you get voted out because of it okay hey the American people if they somehow get fooled into thinking your principles that actually helping them along gets you out of office you've done your duty and you've served up to a point where you can help and then they had a mistake instead you are the the it's and it's it's openly said straight up Jeff Flake said it if I was if I was running for reelection I wouldn't even called for this FBI investigation that he was the catalyst that made it happen he wouldn't do it because we're worried about reelection so much just do what you're gonna do if you don't get reelected what's the big deal okay I've been in the Senate for 20 years fine do something else but do something for American people it shows where are where the representation of the country actually is gone no one cares about representing it care about getting that next job as if if they don't get that next reelection they're gonna end up on the streets it's just not the case yeah with the Republicans I mean there's only so much pressure we can actually put on them like they're raising money to try to get susan collins out if she votes for him that's that's certainly good but for the Democrats I think on some level they haven't really woken up to what's going on in this country because they're worried about the political implications if they don't support him here's the thing we've spent this whole year supporting progressive candidates in primaries where Jenk and I and others including jr. have covered literally every primary night that happened making sure that people know about the right candidates that's why we were covering for example Alexandra Casa Cortez and literally dozens of videos a year before the election while others have finally caught on and those candidates have been winning so here's the thing you might think that if you support judge Kavanagh you have a better chance in the general election I Got News for you you're gonna lose your primary because we're gonna be waiting for you the next time around you might think that you've saved your political future no you've simply nailed your coffin shut with a slightly different shade of when it's gonna happen and so that is a promise that I would make to heidi heitkamp to joe manchin hopefully the next time around and others as well well Joe mesh has had his has had a couple knives in his back already for supporting things that this particular administration you're talking about when he when he made sure he was being he was facilitating whatever was that Mike Pence wanted and in my pits still went on the campaign trail and say you know this loser you know what he does he goes running kisses ass and then he was wasting I thought I was on your side no and no matter how many times it happens to you you will continue to push down that road because you think a it's gonna keep me in office no matter how much you get humiliated honestly after you just got through bowing down to someone who actually doesn't care anything about your political aspirations yeah and to like one of the the lessons of the past two years or you know since Donald Trump became getting office is almost anything can happen no matter how bad it is it generally passes out of the news and we move on that's one of the sad things about the news cycles over the past year but I Got News for you when it comes to judge Kavanaugh for the rest of our lives I don't care how long passes between now and then when we hear the name judge Kavanaugh we're gonna thank multiple sexual assaults when we hear the name judge Cavanaugh we're gonna think of the name Christine Blasi Ford Deborah Ramirez Julie sweat Nick and others as well we're not gonna forget about this and we're not going to forget how people voted on this that's true for the Republicans also true for the Democrats so bear that in mind now on to the indications that some others have given Jeff Flake who of course pushed for this FBI sham investigation in the first place so Elena plot of the Atlantic tweeted I'm told by source with direct knowledge that flake is quote still having issues and that some colleagues are trying to walk him through them the issue is that he briefly felt a stiffening in his back and it was such an unfamiliar sensation that he desperately went to the Republicans to soften him up again senator Coons who along with flake said that if it turned out that he had lied during his testimony they would not support him says that just now that flake reached out to him and asked if they could speak at length later a Senate aides said Murkowski is scaring everyone but I don't know they won't say who the aide who who the aid is for so are they scaring us because support scaring us because they're not gonna support him I don't know the easy question asked just flake in this whole thing is after that interview I'm sure people in the media have seen this maybe reporters he's doing a media tour so after he said you know if it comes out that he was lying in the testimony last week then that would eliminate him completely hey many publications many people I mean maybe watch the young Church pointed out the multiple times he lied at that testimony so the next question is Jeff Flake is so here's my list yeah I've got five pages of lies which one of these is the one that's gonna disqualify them and let him answer that question because I still don't believe it yeah yeah look I my gut says that they're gonna disappoint us my good ol that's what like that said because it doesn't always happen I mean John McCain that's true as bad as he is he did put the thumbs down on the full ACA repeal it is possible that Jeff Flake will decide in the last days that he will serve as a senator and I know he thinks that this is just one step on the continuation of his career when he runs for and becomes the Republican nominee for president Jeff Flake buddy that's not going to happen okay this is the end go out with a little bit of a little bit of pride a little bit of dignity do the right thing okay you're just you're gonna go you're gonna lobby you're gonna make tons of money you are gonna be absolutely fine but you're not gonna be president so don't worry about that worry about what message you were sending to tens of millions of women who have been through similar experiences and what for once to think that their government actually has their back and not just the backs of well-connected powerful conservative males and please do the right thing is that he can only lose one he could still lose one Republican vote I think I remember seeing he can lose one Republican but I'm trying to hear the numbers yes it has still survived so I mean even in that s but they would need to be too and that's why and I don't have that much skepticism on this yeah we'll see by the way it random but um you know there's been all these different groups coming out to say that they don't support Kavanagh that don't normally get involved there was this giant group of different churches that said he should not be put on the Supreme Court um you had like 650 law or knows 1200 law professors now have said that based on his temperament and judicial like you know all that that he showed in the testimony he shouldn't be put there I didn't even know that there were 1,200 law firm some kind of tree but there are and they agree on something um but also retired Justice John John Paul Stevens said the Cavanaugh's temperament and judgment don't meet the standard for the Supreme Court it is not often that retired Supreme Court justices weigh in on new ones and bear in mind John Paul Stevens supported Kavanagh before the allegations came out so it did actually switch after the testimony that's because he gets the thing for himself now yes it's sorry last thing I know we've gone way too long with Kavanagh but you know what it's actually harder to have to try and weigh out wherever not this senator of that Center or that third Center is gonna vote a certain way so that I can determine my vote based off that I'm talking about maybe some of the the red state Democrats that are in this position right now because they're thinking okay if it's gonna be overwhelming and they're gonna vote from anyway then I can too and I could still look good if you ignore what everyone else is saying and just do what you think based off your own moral and principles or if your representative of people of those people's morals and principles or the general thought process of the country if you do it that way you know to worry about other people and just let it fall where it where it does that's easier on your brain just relax and do what you feel is right and do what you've based off what you've seen and read not off of what other people have done it's way more work gives you more headaches just relax you're getting paid enough already yeah do what's right that's that doesn't often come up on okay okay look I wish that we keep talking about this most important story in the country right now obviously it's why on the damage report we've covered it possibly more than any other show in the country but we do have other needs to get to so we're gonna take a break when we come back a nice immigration facility where they detain various people absolutely horrific conditions we're gonna give you the lowdown on that and then what does the EPA want more of in your body coming up soon
