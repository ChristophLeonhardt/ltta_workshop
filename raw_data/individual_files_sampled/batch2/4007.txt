we are following breaking news in the Brett Kavanaugh investigation NBC News has learned that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his team worked behind the scenes for days to get his friends to refute allegations by Deborah Ramirez that Cavanaugh exposed himself to her while they were in college this comes as the White House today authorized the FBI to expand its supplemental investigation into Kavanaugh that investigation must be wrapped up by Friday NBC News has learned that at least one mutual friend has attempted to contact the FBI with information pertinent to the investigation but as yet to be contacted by the bureau with me now is one of the reporters who just broke the story NBC News national political reporter Heidi Prez Bella the panel is back as well Heidi first run through what your reporting is right Katie this is someone who did not want to go public about someone who has potentially very pertinent information who has been attempting to get through to the FBI has made several attempts finally hired a lawyer yesterday but is getting no guarantees she's tried contacting a local field office and told that this is not their authority to take this information so let's break it down she is a mutual friend of both Debbie Ramirez and Brett Kavanaugh who knew them from their days at Yale Law School she is in at Yale University she is in possession of a series of text messages that she says she has not drawn any conclusions about but that suggests that they definitely need to investigate further what was going on in the lead-up to this New Yorker piece exposing w Ramirez's story specifically Katie she wanted to get out these texts that show that Cavanaugh may have been trying to discredit Debbie Ramirez in the run-up to the New Yorker story running even though he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he wasn't aware of the New Yorker story until it ran so that's something that needs to be looked into whether he was pushing other classmates who were part of this tight-knit circle that includes W Ramirez and the lady who crafted this memo her name by the way is Carrie Bertram she is 51 years old former classmate who has been concerned for quite a while trying to bring this information nation forward the White House says that this is normal that Cavanaugh would do this and the run-up to this story that it's PR quote PR 101 Katie but we've talked with experts who've been through this confirmation process before specifically Bob Bauer who say this would be highly imprudent for someone like Brett Kavanaugh to be reaching out and trying to sway the information that is being put forth in the run-up to one of these stories that given these severity of the accusations he had no business but reaching out to these people according to the text messages that's exactly what he did the woman who exchanged the text messages with another friend had text messages saying that Brett is asking me to do this Brett's team is asking me to do this including procuring a photo of Debbie Ramirez and Brett later that shows them smiling at a bridal party well guess what another thing that we obtained in these text messages suggests that Debbie Ramirez was actually very uncomfortable during that interaction in that photo you see it there that was taken at a wedding of a mutual friend Karen Yura Savitch and her husband Brett Kavanaugh was apparently trying to procure this photo presumably to try and discredit ramirez's account to show that they're our friends well in fact according to these text messages Kerry Bertram says that she thought it was very odd how Debra Ramirez was behaving at this party that she was avoiding Brett Kavanaugh that she was clinging to her that Deborah Maris was clinging to Kerry Berchem so a lot to unpack in these emails you can read it on NBC News calm and but this does shed light on on Kavanaugh and Ramirez's relationship that they they knew each other better than we had previously been led to believe right that there was this tight circle of former Yale classmates that in fact they wound up 10 years later being in the same wedding party and so yes when Kavanaugh came out he was trying to of course distance himself from Debbie Ramirez but what this shows is that they were in this tight circle and that he personally according to these text messages that we obtained may have been trying to pressure some of his classmates to come out in refute Debbie Ramirez and that's something that obviously needs to be looked at by the FBI but at this point is not according to Kerry Bertram she's made several attempts to get through to the FBI this very relevant Katie given that today is a day when the White House says hey no holds barred we want them to overturn my choice are we sure that he was pressuring the friends or is it could it be more innocuous than that what is the reporting show right the text messages show that the mutual friend Karen who was texting to Kerry Bertram said that Brett used his name and Brett's team and Brett's guy that was the exact language had asked her to one get a photo get that photo that we showed and two that Brett using she used his name which suggests that it was Brett personally was asking her to go on the record to defend him interesting is there a way to charitably read this at hey listen he's been accused of something and he wants to find the people who were around him at the time to say hey listen do you remember it that way because I don't remember it that way that is a that is of course what the White House is saying that when you're being accused of something you're going to go to the mats and try to find everyone who can disprove that allegation but like I said the experts we talked to said that Brett Kavanaugh should not have personally given the position that he's in be trying to micromanage this campaign to try and essentially discredit w ramirez's allegations hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've
