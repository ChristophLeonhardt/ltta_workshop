a fierce debate has broken out over the opinions of Kanye West for some reason West praised the politics of conservative commentator Candace Owens and reportedly said I love Donald Trump West made the remarks while publicizing his new book reinventing consciousness through a critique of hegelian dialectic yo during a speech on pre-socratic reasoning among badass G's at the Society for philosophical reflection by people whose chain of thought is completely incomprehensible the comments drew immediate criticism from Jay shameless racecard a spokesman for black lives matter who said quote how can we continue to convince black Americans that they are helpless victims with no control over their own lives if famous black rappers act as if they can just walk around with their own opinions

digital scale and a four week trial of having the post office right inside your computer all right so here's my question and we have we actually forgotten what freedom looks like I was thinking about this because we had Charlotte pence on a a while back and Shella pence obviously the daughter of Mike Pence our vice president my and Mike Pence to me is one of the most abused politicians out there I just yesterday I think was some celebrity tweeted this is the most dangerous politician in America and I thought because y-you know because you disagree with some of his opinions he just gets attacked and attacked he's just a punching bag he's one of these typical Republicans that they attack an attack in a sack and then after he's you know out of office they say you know he was great he's not like the Republicans they have today is just like they're talking about George Bush now you know they're saying oh they were great not like Trump well soon it'll be you know well Pence was great not like the next whoever the next Republican is so I asked Charlotte what's it like having your dad just attacked all the time for nothing for just being a decent ordinary guy a straight-up guy and she said that when she went to events with Mike Pence it would upset her to see people protesting or shouting things at him but he would say to her that's what freedom looks like right that is a very very mature response this is why I call Mike Pence Minch I just crushed his name together because he is a man she understands that freedom doesn't look like what you like it doesn't look like everything happening the way you want to do it looks sometimes like absolute chaos now the thing is we know we already know that a lot of people on the Left have abandoned the idea of freedom and we talk about it every day right people on campus who shout down speakers that people want to ban certain kinds of speech Hillary Clinton who doesn't like the fact that corporations can make documentaries that attacker all those all those people who are who don't seem to feel that an election should be able to overturn their plans they feel elections are great until suddenly they're elite ideas of what how the global world should unfold getting wrong-footed then suddenly elections are not so good that must have been a Russian plot or something like this we know the left does this all the time but recently I have started to hear this stuff from the right and you know the right of course covers a wide range I'm on the right but you know that I've started to hear from certain people on the right that basically freedom has to end because we're no longer moral so Pat Buchanan who is toyed with fascism for a long long time he's been in several administration several Republican administrations but he is they had been hints of anti-semitism and hints of kind of fascistic leans he wrote a column over the weekend it was just talking about the rise of the right in Hungary now I'm not gonna comment on Hungarian politics because they they've got all this pressure to take in immigrants that they don't want to take in refugees that they don't want I understand that some of the attacks on the guy there what's his name were bands or something like that they say you know he's anti-semitic cuz he attacked George Soros George Soros is one of Israel's greatest enemies so I don't see how it's anti-semitic to attack him so forget about that but he starts to say Pat Buchanan starts to write the democracy is not basically serving the people anymore and he starts to talk about America and here's what he says our democracy boasts of a First Amendment freedom of speech and press that protects blasphemy pornography filthy language and the burning of the American flag we stand for a guaranteed right of women to abort their children and of homosexuals to marry we offer the world a freedom of religion that prohibits the teaching of our cradle faith and it's moral code in our public schools our elites view this as social progress upward from a dark past to much of the world however too much the world however America has become the most secularized and decadent society on earth and the title the Ayatollah bestowed upon us the Great Satan is not altogether undeserved and if what our democracy is delivered here has caused tens of millions of Americans to be repulsed and to secede into social isolation why would other nations embrace a system that produced so poison to politics and so polluted a culture nationalism and authoritarianism are on the march rights the washington post democracy is an ideal and in practice seems under siege and buchanan says yes and there are reasons for this the MA listen to this carefully democracy lacks content as a political system it does not engage the heart and if Europe's people see their leaders as accommodating a transnational EU while failing to secure national borders they will use democracy to replace them with men of action that famous fascist you know celebration of men of action I would personally rather have men of thought but men of action okay so our democracy has led us to become this immoral decadent nation and but the problem with democracy is it has no content now this by the way you know this is what a lot of the radical Muslims say you know that remember a joy in in Turkey he said democracy is like a streetcar when you get to the stop you want you get off you know and that's because he sees the content as being the point not the freedom itself on our own site on The Daily wire site Eric Erickson and I don't mean to attack him personally he writes some stuff I really like but he wrote a very thunderous denunciation of America saying the American experiment is at an end the American experiment says Eric Eric isn't is at an end the nation will continue but barring some crisis that rouses the American people to our better angels the experiment is over our founders determined that our republic had to be premise on a good and moral people the law is only as good as the people there are just too many examples of the people not being so good evangelical support for the president is at an all-time high this news comes as more Playboy Playmates and porn stars come forward confessed to adultery with the president while his wife was pregnant even many of the president's ardent supporters now acknowledge it but they do not care because the president gives them what they want call me crazy it says Eric Erickson but when you have the all-powerful omnipotent creator of the entire universe on your side you should not have to rely on a slightly orange adulterer for protection from your enemies so let's think about this for a minute are we now deserving of destruction because we're no longer moral as democracy failed us but first let's talk about sheets the sheets are incredibly important to me for a simple reason I never sleep but I do go to bed I go to bed every night and I lie there and I read and I think and I discourse and then about five minutes before the alarm goes off I finally drift off so I need my bed to be comfortable because I'm not sleeping there I am lying there and I am experiencing every minute and so I love ball and branch sheets what makes them unique is each sheet is crafted from a hundred percent organic cotton and that means Bolin bran sheets not only feel incredible they also look amazing which matters because I'm wide awake and since boyhood branch sells exclusively online you don't pay that expensive retail markup you get twice

now at Boland branch com spelled bol L and branch compro moco Clavin bowl and branch com promo code Clavin you will love the sheets so to me I got to be honest some of this stuff seems like a overall nonsense at any given moment in time when you have a country filled with 325 million people there's going to be strange that you find immoral you know if you had look on back into the 1950s when people were going to church more when there was no divorce very little divorce when abortion was illegal you still would have found all things by the way which I disapprove of the collapse of our religion I disapproved certainly of abortion I certainly this would prove of divorce especially when there are children involved and yet at the same time there were plenty of immoral things going on like the kind of bigotry that kept people from kept the black guy from using a bathroom so that he had to explain to his son why we can't go in there because the color of your skin is not the right color that was immoral as well so there's always immorality going on no nation is perfect there's always stuff going on what I notice what I notice is these people who decry the immorality of America also sent tend to turn out for authoritarianism that's what bothers me about the Buchanan article is that way basically he's saying democracy has no content and so we're immoral and we need to get rid of democracy or put it aside for authoritarian rule so that we can be moral but here's the problem it is true it is true that our founders said that our Constitution was written for amoral people it is true that only immoral people can be free but here's the paradox only immoral people can be free but only if free people can be moral because if somebody puts a gun to your head and says don't get divorced if somebody puts a gun to your head and says don't get an abortion the right you may get the right outcome but you're not a moral person you're not a moral person if you don't cheat on your wife because her father is a mob boss who says he'll kill you if you do you're just somebody who's afraid you're just somebody who's under the gun and that is not morality so only well it's true only immoral people can be free it is also true that only if free people can be moral so how do we solve that problem well first let's look at the way we don't solve the problem you know a lot of people on the right and that I'm talking about the right I've already talked I'll talk about how the left doesn't care about freedom anymore but a lot of people in the right have started to uphold Vladimir Putin as the defender of the faith he is the great man who is going to defend the Christian faith he's going to defend white supremacy and white the white races and he is the one person who's committed to the kind of rule we need and we see this among especially among the far-right and to give to say the only nice thing I'll say about Putin is that he does he does play on religious bigotry he does play on hatred of homosexuals but he doesn't he's not a thief doesn't play on anti-semitism he doesn't play on white supremacy he doesn't talk about that at all but Putin is a criminal Putin is a guy who blew up his own people in order to start a war who prosecuted the war in Chechnya with just absolute brutality Demma journalists and critics of Putin vanished and died under mysterious circumstances basically he is running a small mob of about a hundred or a hundred 50 people that they call the oligarchs these are the guys when the state when the Soviet Union collapsed these are the guys who pillaged the holding of this the holdings of the state and made themselves billionaires right that's all it is is just a bunch of guys basically you know running a mom a running a mob for their own benefit their own profit and oppressing the Russian people they are not they are not the founders the protectors of morality by any stretch of the imagination Trump may sleep around Trump may do bad things in his personal life Trump has done nothing nothing that compares to the evil that Vladimir Putin does and so when I hear people on the right saying oh you know we can't you know our country's not moral we need Vladimir Putin that really it really does disturb me so you know what do you what do you what what do you look for what do you look for when you look for freedom what does freedom look like does it look like morality does it look like people going to church and certain shirts and ties does it look like no gay pride parades where people wander around you know flashing their fetishes at you which is incredibly annoying and incredibly grotesque you know to me to me that doesn't make sense at all it doesn't make sense at all because because like I said only immoral people can be free but only a free people can be moral you know I took a little bit of actual encouragement last night from watching the hearing on Mike Pompeo mom Mike Pompeo is Trump's and former CIA director Trump's nomination to be Secretary of State and there has just been an absurd you know the resistance the resistance has put up against Mike Pompeo it has just been embarrassing I mean we remember when Cory Booker went up against him because he didn't support gay people and you think like you know because he's a Christian basically and he thinks that being gay is not moral and does he mistreat people in his offices because they're gay because Jean Shaheen said she wasn't going to senator from New Hampshire said she wasn't going to support him because he was against abortion he was against abortion and against gays and all she had a moment it's a really interesting moment I just want to play this one little clip this is during the hearings from Mike Pompeo Jean cheese starts questioning him and basically accusing him of not being fair to his own staff at the CIA and pompay OHS argument is hey I have my opinions I have my religion this is what I believe but everybody gets the same treatment for me and they just to show you how stupid this stuff has been they had this exchange and one like this and yet you were criticized at the CIA for undermining policies of the previous administration administration to improve diversity at the CIA I don't know the criticism that you're referring to I have to tell you I didn't undermine a single policy we've emphasized it we've talked about it we've worked on it I think I'm proud of the work that I did to continue to develop and increase the capacity for the CIA to deliver a diverse work force to meet the challenges the intelligence challenges in that case around the world well I would just say Michael Weinstein who is a former Air Force officer who founded the military Religious Freedom Foundation says that he has been seeing increasing complaints from those inside the intelligence community under your leadership so I think there have been a number of concerns raised ma'am ma'am if I might please Dean um the number of we call them no fear complaints the statutory requirement decreased from 2016 to 2017 by 40% good good good so everything I said was nonsense good so so they go into this committee and the president gets a Secretary of State I don't think a Secretary of State has ever been refused and so this committee they had the votes cuz Rand Paul was holding up the holding up saying Pompeyo supported the Iraq war and Rand Paul doesn't like us to do anything overseas and he wasn't gonna support him but Rand Paul says now he's got assurances from Pompeo that now he dislikes the Barak war and he wants it to be over and so on and so forth so but they split on a 10 to 10 vote because the deciding senator Johnny Isakson was at a funeral and so he couldn't vote and that just would have been embarrassing I think would have come through a vote eventually anyway but it could have been held up but Senator Chris Koos Democrat from Delaware changed his vote to present so they could get him out of committee and that is the way these things have to work right he didn't have to support him he won't support him on the floor but he left the thing get out of committee because this resistance you know bill McGurn wrote a thing I mean just talking about people who have lost the plot of freedom who've lost what freedom looks like that it looks like losing sometimes sometimes freedom looks like losing you know Bill McGurn wrote this great column today talking about the fact where he says all right Donald Trump you know has violated norms of behavior he's violated norms of politeness he has violated norms of the way a president behaves but but the elites who oppose him the elites who feel that the election took away their plans their power their idea of what American America should be have so much have violated norms so much more than Trump has and brought things down so much further that it's they who were really the threat to freedom and he goes on any lists this thing he says in the thick of the 2016 election the New York Times ran a front-page article in which it advertised that the particular dangers posed by mr. Trump's candidacy meant that the long-held norm of journalistic objectivity might have to give way to a more oppositional approach so the press lost its way good liberal says bill McGurn once found the idea of spying on American citizens without just cause unconscionable but when the target is a former Trump campaign associate it becomes okay to get a warrant based on an unverified dossier paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign so the intelligence community lost its way when Sally Yates was acting Attorney General and president Trump issued an executive order on immigration she objected she objected to miss Yates ordered the entire Justice Department not to obey the president despite a finding from the Department's Office of Legal Counsel that the order was lawful and she was applauded in her insubordination by Andrew Weissman then a Justice attorney who now serves on Robert Muller's team so the Justice Department lost its way in the middle of a me-too moment ostensibly all about more respect for women the president's press secretary Sarah Sanders has been derided as everything from a summer whore to a slightly chunky soccer mom so the social warriors on the Left have lost their way and lost the idea of what freedom looks like and how it works and the pardon power enjoyed by the president is among the most unfettered in the constitution but because the president is mr. Trump and the pardon for controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the pardon was for the ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals has opted for lawlessness it has opted to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the pardons legitimacy so many many judges have lost their way and have lost what freedom looks like because they want it to go their way and that's not what freedom looks like let me just say for just a moment before we get to the Jonah Goldberg interview that Plato the the famous Greek philosopher and a and Plato's Socrates had many of these fears about about democracy he feared he you know he talks about in the Republic Socrates talks about the fact that that freedom people become addicted to freedom they then start to love pleasure they then start to love money they become fascinated by their own ability to buy things fascinated by pleasure and lose freedom and freedom devolves into tyranny and he says freedom democracy is the path the tyranny says Socrates so it is a real problem so what is that where does that leave us if only if free people can be moral and only a moral people can be free or we just caught in this circle of decline as Socrates said that has to lead to tyranny the answer to me is simply this freedom looks like an argument freedom looks like everyone's speaking freely trying to convince the other of the way to go I believe that our particular democracy is based on Christianity if you can't sell your Christianity you just can't sit around and say the American experiment is over you've got to go out there and actually sell what you believe you've got to sell it as a joyful positive thing that is going to improve people's lives not as something that means that people who act differently than you have to be condemned because that's just a no sale as far as I'm concerned and it's not Christianity either go look at the Gospels for a change go look at what Jesus says look at the times he condemns other people's behaviors almost never he almost never does unless they're religious people blocking the way to heaven to ordinary people's path to heaven that's what he really gets down on okay that's what he really gets down on otherwise he's talking to you about how to find the kingdom of heaven are you talking about that are you selling that or are you just thumping your hand thumping your fist into your palm and condemning people sin and then expecting them to turn around because it makes you feel like a righteous person you know here here's the thing it is about winning the argument freedom is about winning the argument that's why I fight so hard against the left when they want to shut people down if you're afraid of winning the argument if you're afraid of losing the argument even and by the way even if you lose the argument your responsibility remains the same because then you're talking to what they call the remnant then you're talking to the next generation that's gonna come down the pike when Cicero in Rome lost the argument as my own son has pointed out in an article in the LA Times one Syst Cicero lost the argument and the Republic of Rome collapsed he wrote about democracy for future generations John Adams was quoting Cicero while they were forming the Constitution in the decklid and the Declaration that's who you're talking to you're talking freedom never dies the right never the truth never dies you got to keep on talking this whole idea that oh you're bad and therefore we have to get rid of freedom it's cowardice it's cowardice it's cowardice to say that we've become an immoral nation therefore we need to get at some in authoritarians in here to enforce morality that is just yeah I can't even say the air but it's chicken it's chicken you've got to stay in the argument and if you lose it in this generation you try to win it in the next it's freedom sounds like debate freedom sounds like talking freedom sounds like protests freedom makes a lot of noise all right we're gonna have Jonah Goldberg come on to talk about suicide of the West a really interesting interview not as depressing as it sounds from the title we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire calm and listen and while you're there subscribe so you can be in tomorrow's mailbag hit the podcast button at the Andrew Klavan podcast hit the mailbags sign and write any question you

the better Jonah Goldberg maybe he's he's certainly one of my favorite political writers he is witty his prose is graceful he's got all kinds of a range of knowledge both pop culture and intellectual culture his book is fascinating suicide of the West how the rebirth of tribalism populism nationalism and identity politics is destroying American democracies out today Jonah is senior editor National Review as well as a Los Angeles Times columnist he's the author of two New York Times bestsellers liberal fascism which is just terrific I thought an epoch-making study of the 30s and 40s and the tyranny of cliches here he is discussing his new book suicide of the West Joan it's good to see you thanks for coming on it's great to be here man uh you know suicide of the West first of all I've read every word of this which is going to make this a unique interview in the his American journalism I don't know what came over me I'd must have it just caught me out you know I started I thought I'd skim it and then I was caught up in no it's right I mean you do terrific work as always but let's talk about this I mean it's such a this it's called suicide of the West hub the rebirth of populism nationalism and identity politics is destroying American democracy now I was going away for the musical to come out but I think that's that is not a happy title I mean do you is do you believe that the West is actually committing suicide what was it you know it might be an apocryphal story but Chou Enlai the former Chinese premier was once asked what he thought about the what the verdict was on the French Revolution in like 1973 and his response was too soon to tell so look for a book that begins about 300,000 years ago I think Mike on my conception of suicide can have a long time frame on it I think the reason I chose suicide not death of the West or decline of the West that suicides a choice uh-huh and I think our civilization Army is making choices right now that if carried to their logical extreme or logical conclusion are suicidal in nature so this is not it's not a Marx tiny envision of those kinds of choices and you're talking about a much different choices what are the choices you're talking about right so I was very influenced by economic historian Deirdre McCloskey who basically argues that this thing I call the miracle right whatever you want to call Liberal Democratic capitalism modernity right this thing that emerges essentially from I would argue from this from the English enlightenment or the Scottish enlightenment one of the things that Steve Pinker gets wrong is treating the Enlightenment like they're all one thing right because as Mike Meyers would say and so I married an axe murderer when it comes to enlightenment if it's not Scottish it's crap one of the things that your German class key I think is fairly persuasive on is that the thing that made this once in all of human history transformation into human prosperity human a sort of fulfillment that you get starting in the 1700s and that the American Founding is the symbol of was all created by words ideas stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and which I don't think she fully appreciates is that a civilization that can be created by words can also be destroyed by words that if you don't um you know if you don't express gratitude for these amazing things that we have this incredible gift that we sort of stumbled into you're in danger of losing it you know in the Bible Old Testament and knew that the whole idea of gratitude and remembering certain things really means honoring certain things is hugely important for keeping the Spirit of God alive keeping a civilization alive and I think that's true in secular terms as well if you don't take a moment to have some gratitude for where we are as a species right now and how we got here you're inclined you're what happens is that you then breed entitlement and resentment and that's suicidal right so it's not not demography in the marks tiny and kind of thing it's certainly not Marxist you know I don't believe in cold impersonal forces guiding us I think that as Ronald Reagan would say freedom is not we don't inherent freedom in our blood it's in danger every generation it has to be taught yeah civilization is a verb we are all born naked penniless and ignorant and human nature has no history so what is required of every generation is to teach the next generation those things that should be grateful for is that's the only way you're gonna conserve and preserve them is to teach them to be grateful for them you know it's really interesting when you say this I read Pinker's book - and one of the things that I like Pinker a lot and I enjoy his writing but but it it he does kind of get so materialist that you know he basically says that you know look you've got long life and good health and and money what else do you want but I mean people do want something else don't they they want freedom they want some kind of idea of meaning in their lives and you kind of talk about that more you have a sense that this is something that can be preserved and recreated I do and I think one of the reasons I agree with you you know Pinker is sort of a Vulcan you know and yes he's incredibly useful in explaining the material side of things right but because he's such a you know and again I use his books a lot and mutt from my book but he's such a secular a sort of materialist he kind of doesn't have a lot of patience for the more spiritual romantic side of things and I argue you know going back to will her Berg one of the great sort of conservative intellectuals that man should properly be understood as Homo religio we are hardwired to want something more than just simple material goods we want a sense of meaning a conception of our place in the universe we want religion and I mean religion in the broadest sense that we need a system we want a system of values that tells us our place gives us a sense of meaning fills the holes in our soul and that stuff isn't being taught either and you know Mary ever said had a great piece in the Atlantic not long ago talking about how the rise of the the identity politics that we see today can be tracked to the breakdown of the family in the 1970s and because what happens is we are born seeking a sense of meaning in our place in the world and if we don't get it from our family it doesn't mean we had to stop searching for it you know Robert Nesbit called the quest for community and we start looking elsewhere for it identity politics which says your entire existence could be summed up by the color of your skin or your gender preferences or whatever is a source of meaning I think it's a cheap and shabby source of meaning but it's a very real one for a lot of people and so what you have to keep in mind is that human nature abhors a vacuum if you don't provide people with a healthy sense of meaning a healthy sense of belonging in the world it they will they'll find an unhealthy one it's sort of like the G K Chesterton thing about if you stop believing in God it's not that you won't believe in anything it's that you won't believe in nothing you believe in anything right and so people will find other things as sources a meaning and - those are just simply likely not to be healthy and not contribute to the sustaining of the civilization that we live in so we're if we're now at this this pretty pass you know where where did this begin I mean I know you're I don't see your you know your fan club picture of Donald Trump behind you I know you're not a big Trump Jan but but he's but he's obviously not the start of anything I mean he's way downstream right all politics is downstream of I think these cultural trends I think that politicians can make these cultural trends worse sure but you know you know Barack Obama if you read his second inaugural his vision of what America is about which was a consistent theme throughout his presidency is that you have two political units you have the individual and you have the state in Washington right nothing else right and the problem with that is that it is a really cheap form of sort of progressive libertarianism in the sense that you're free to do all the little things that you want to do as an individual but if you need help with anything else the only place you can look to is Washington and the problem with that is that the place you get meaning life starts with the family I mean again Hana Arendt has this great line she says every generation Western civilization is invaded by barbarians we call them children certainly happen to my house as a species we are all born naked penniless and ignorant and you have we come with a lot of pre-loaded software but if we don't get the update starting in the family we can be you know we can go off the rails if you took a baby living today and sent it back a thousand years to a Viking village you know sent it when to New Rochelle and stole about Viking skull baby and centered with Viking village and if it was adopted by a Viking family will grow up to you know to pillage Western England if you took a Viking baby and you sent it to New Rochelle it will grow up to be an orthodontist the civilization that you're born into matters enormous Lee and I think the breakdown of civil society the breakdown of the family these these institutions where we get our sense of meaning and belonging as they break down we look for other ones and so you have all these people who don't have anything to do with their vert with their real communities instead they want to spend time on virtual communities but Facebook Facebook is fine for keeping up with old friends it is horrible for making new friends because what it ends up doing particularly the political context is reinforcing and confirming your existing biases and multiplying them on the both the left and the right and and so I think that I'll you know one of the things that we're having is we retreat from civil society which there's an enormous amount of social science that that is in fact happening is we start watch politics as if it's a form of entertainment and we start rooting for our heroes and rooting against the villains and we see it simply as a story of drama of my team versus your team and that I think leads to very unhealthy politics whether it has anything to do with Trump or not that trend existed long before Trump came on the scene he exploited it to win but he's not to blame for it you know do you feel I felt this when I was reading Pinker's book that when he writes about Donald Trump I suddenly thought you know calm down you know he may he may be a good president he may be a bad brother he's kind of living in all of our heads rent-free at this point are we thinking about this guy too much I mean is it do you see him as a real break with something I'm like I said I know you're not a fan but do you see him as an actual break or just a kind of bump in the road um III think he represents a real break of sorts I don't think he represents the break that the resistance wants to turn him into right I mean my standard line is look Donald Trump isn't Hitler Hitler could have repealed Obamacare he's not he's not this he's not this dangerous you know despot um but he is a creature of entertainment culture and I think he views the job through that prism way too much for my tastes and I think that you know Orwell has this great line where he says a man can feel himself a failure and take to drink and become all the more of a failure because he drinks I think that one of the problems that I think you and some of my friends who are um who are sort of more pro-trump than I am what they don't appreciate is the dialectic nature of our politics these days Donald Trump's misbehaviors often repeatedly get defended because of things that Barack Obama did hmm I shudder to think what Elizabeth Warren will do citing some of the things that Barack that that Donald Trump has done as a precedent yeah and I also wonder what conservatives what a Democratic president will be able to do or be guilty of in their personal lives that conservatives will be able to denounce that they won't be hypocritical for given what they defended in this guy and that I think is gonna be a real problem yeah I can see that being a problem down the road too but you know your vision weirdly is is more hopeful than your title I mean your title is at ya know so so where do we start what do you would you like to see happen that is realistic that could actually begin to happen in this country yeah so I mean I don't have a lot of public policy program in here because in part out of my argument is that the rhetoric matters right I say if a simple vision created by words it can be destroyed by words that means we how one of things I want to get people do is think about how to how they talk about their own civilization their own culture of their own country and that's part of the argument of the book but if you want to serve a basic public policy argument push as much power as possible down to the most local level possible you know you know when you say that to left wingers they immediately say oh so you want to have Jim Crow or slavery back or like no no no I mean war we mended the Constitution a couple times that's a settled issue right but do I think that hipsters and organs should be able to order stinky cheese from France without the FDA saying it's okay yeah do I think that people should be able to organize their lives as long as they respect basic civil rights and basic human rights as they want yes and you'll still have culture wars but one of the great things about pushing this stuff to the most local level possible is the winners have to look the losers in the eye the next day right it you have to see them at kids soccer games and yeah that's supermarket you have this this and that breeds a certain amount of humility but you know you're talking about your neighbors you're talking about the parents of your kids best friend when you get into political arguments right now because of this thing I was talking about before about treating politics as a form of entertainment where we all just sit in our living rooms and watching on TV is you end up getting these grand coalition's between one one political tribe and another where you never actually have to deal with the human the human being on the other side of the argument um at the more locally you get starting in the family you know the names of the powers that be you know you know them by their first name if in the family you actually that's mom and dad right but even in local communities or in your school you know the names of the principal you know names of your aldermen you know the names of your parish priests you know the names of the people in your community it gives you a sense of control over your own life which is one of the reasons why I think politics is so bad right now is people don't feel like they have that sense of control over their own lives so push it all the way down wow that's a really really interesting about this because I just think there's so much in this book it covers as you say it covers an awful lot of history yeah but the suicide of the West how the rebirth of populism nationalism and identity politics is destroying American democracy Jonah Goldberg one of the best political writers in the country if not the best Jonah it's always great to see I hope you'll come back again I would love to come back and next time you're in DC you gotta let me know and we'll have you on my podcast and you can you can rail at me for an hour I will be there thanks a lot good to see really interesting I love the fact that I asked him like what he would like to have done and he had an excellent answer as like more local government which is by the way something that's actually happening and then we'll talk about try and talk about this tomorrow again the country looks a lot different at the local level and it doesn't the national level sexual follies well this is the ultimate sexual folly Smallville actress Allison Mac has been arrested and charged for her role in a sex cult run by a guy named Keith Rainier who was arrested previously this she would apparently she's charged with luring women in then forcing them to starve themselves so they looked like what Keith Renier liked they were ordered to remain celibate they were held down as Rijn ears initials were branded below their hips with a cauterizing pen this was called nexium his next thing some kind of medicine or something like No yeah that's a bet anyway it was the cult is called nexium let me just play a brief clip of aliceandmac doing this worshipful interview with cult leader or accused cult leader Keith Renier what do you see as the greatest limitation between men and women in their quest to really in a loving and compassionate way well the biggest limitation that women have is that they're women and the biggest limitation that men have is that they're men so ladies you should approach here's a protip okay fuck yourself having someone's initials being branded on your body get out of the relationship especially if he says prayer off these guys are always so empty and shallow and they always have that look like it didn't I say something so profound and she just can't you can barely restrain themselves if it's proved to be true I hope they get life alright
