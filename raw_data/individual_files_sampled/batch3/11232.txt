another part of the UK's governance has been making headlines the Public Prosecutions Office has a new boss max Hill my barrister once slammed by an MP as a politically correct snowflake mr. Hill came into the spotlight when he was working as an independent reviewer of UK terrorism laws some of which he argues should be scrapped he was slammed for meeting with the organisation cage group which is widely seen as advocating Islamists that Hills own stance on jihadist has been branded scandalously feeble by some of the UK media here's one of his statements that sparked controversy really we should be looking towards for integration and moving away from any notion that we're going to lose a generation due to this travel those who travelled out of the sense of naivety possibly with some brainwashing along the way possibly in their mid-teens we have to leave space for those individuals to be diverted away from the criminal courts okay let's discuss max Hills appointment now with a panel of guests I'd like to welcome to the program Shep be a Raz be political analyst on the left of our screens in the centre Phillip Ingram former intelligence and security officer and on the right mo ants our political and social commentator good evening and well welcome gentlemen shabbir I'd like to ask you first what do you make of this appointment is Max hild the right person for this position well look he's a lawyer and potentially he could be seen as the right person but I think one's got to look at it in the wider context that how is he going to handle the whole situation as we were talking about earlier in your report about integration and whether integration is effective is in a multicultural society and what does integration in itself means does it mean assimilation completely does it mean that the immigrants who came here from different backgrounds should they completely be irrelevant to their upbringing I myself as a British Muslim who grew up here from Pakistani Indian background I have been I feel British I live here in London as a Londoner but at the same time I'm very how to be a Muslim and also coming from a background from South Asia so what one's got to reconcile these issues which may become politically difficult for politicians to handle and also the administrators who quite often and and this is really a slur at times when anything that needs to be discussed and we say we are not going to discuss it because it's politically correct on the other hand you know on on a daily basis whether it's in print media broadcast media or anything there is horrendous sort of issue against Muslims there are headlines every day blaming Muslims as terrorists issue of hijab issue of halal meat and on a daily basis basis Muslims are being marginalized in the UK if it were a politically correct a situation then we would not have these sort of headlines in the newspapers and as I think lady varsity has quite rightly pointed out that it has become acceptable dinner talk to malign Muslims Philip I want to come to you let's talk specifically about the number of people the authorities say Brits who went to Syria to fight for Isis that number at around 850 it's feared around 250 are back now in the UK max Hill is a man who has said that he thinks that of the young the teenagers amongst them that they should be reintegrated back into society as a former intelligence officer what do you think of his approach there has to be a holistic approach it has to be a balance of using the judicial system for people who have committed a crime by joining proscribed organisation and a rehabilitation program remember if someone gets sentenced to a prison sentence in the United Kingdom that prison is there to punish but it's also there to rehabilitate so the rehabilitation can happen inside the prison system I don't think it is properly at the moment and that's a different issue but it should be happening inside the prison system as well as real happening in society and that ties in with the wider contest strategy to make sure that people are not being radicalized and tempted to go off and fight these illegal Wars in the first place and the the controversial side of the contest strategy is the prevent program and that's been extremely successful at stopping young people from going off elsewhere and I think max Hill recognizes that and his review of the the terrorism strategy is bringing that holistic piece together not focusing on one bit or another and then you get the shotty people in the press with it with their headlines but just want to go out there and say that everything's bad you know I understand completely what is going through the issues with your last speakers they said of Muslims feeling as if they have been marginalized I'm from Northern Ireland before Muslim extremism came in I silenced a pub by opening my mouth because everyone looked at me and went is he a terrorist so I know what that feelings like it's not to do with color it's not to do with race it's to do with perception and the way the perception in society is being drummed up and there's too many sensations headlines that are focusing on sign bytes not substance Wow is it sensationalism in the press that this the the kind of sentiment that you know max Hills appointment might endanger counterterrorism efforts is it sensationalism is it realistic thing is very nice say about your beards biography but it's not really relevant and the situation in Northern Ireland is not really relevant what we have right now and I spent some time with Kirsten before Alison Saunders he was is now leading the brexit talks of course but for the for the Labor Party and is widely considered to be probably the best DP we've had in the UK for quite some time the incoming DPP has got an absolute knowledge we thought well we've got British citizens who are out in Syria some of whom who have come home and we already are facing a radicalization crisis because our counter radicalization and I count as terror strategy in UK has been absolutely a joke we have had the government listened husband is working extreme tell me what I'll finish doing I'm doing my bit Philip I finish doing my bit and by all means come in after but we have a government who has invested the time of the wrong people with the neoconservative Lobby we've seen a broken and I've written about this at length and the Huffington Post and I've written about it in blogs and given interviews numerous times that are over it and here with RT as well so we have a situation we've got British kids out in Syria being radicalized now we don't know who's committed what crimes now either we bring them back home now we give them a smack on the bum and we say we're going to put you through the system and we're going to throw you in journalists throw away the key or we are going to take them out with airstrikes which are about 20% accurate or drone strikes which 10 years of use in Afghanistan and Pakistan show up about they're very accurate indeed alternatively alternate no drones are 2 percent accurate and air strikes about 10 20 % accurate if you're lucky alternative facts over things which are I'm not going to have you spewing alternative facts over my bit when I'm giving the reality is very different Phillip Phillip Phillip calm down Phillip calm down look the reality is this the incoming DPP has a problem either we go along with Boris Johnson aside you Javed's secret or dirty plan which the courts have already been willing to you know give some direction over which is that we are almost handing them our rights to protection from a death penalty sentence or we're going to strike them out there or currently we're making them stateless not bring them home so we're not bringing our our trash home we're not dealing with them we're not putting them in prison we're not looking to do radicalize them we've decided the easiest way to just kill them or hand them to the Americans to deal with because it is it is more efficient and control of the minute we do not make decisions go ahead Phillip we have long-standing time so many political statements here without it without any accurate substance that's there let's deal with the the because I haven't been found guilty of any crime it's after they've been fine there's a time to make sure that the lobbying goes in to stop them coming up been getting the death penalty we don't know that they're going to get the death penalty because they haven't been tried so again this is sensationalism that's been brought out truly purely to try and cause political and they haven't got a passport they've been made stateless they're not pretty citizens anymore they've had the right to British citizenship stripped from them they've been arrested by the authorities in Syria they there's an extradition piece out to move them to the United States that you know they're not our responsibility anymore but again you're the United States and we'll give them a fair trial I want to move the conversations Philip the human rights sorry to interrupt your mo I just want to listen to a soundbite of Boris Johnson let's hear it what he had to say his approach on tackling jihadism of course we legally justify those drone strike assassinations as preventive to stop future acts of terror in Syria but that scarcely masks the reality that killing them is also retributive payback for the filmed executions of innocent people I just want to give sabirah an opportunity to to speak again is that the right motive for that what was the foreign secretary talking about basically an official UK government stance of vengeance is that appropriate but look Boris Johnson the former foreign secretary has been also an advocate of brexit on the basis that Britain wants its sovereignty back Britain wants to make its own laws Britain wants to sort of contain its own culture in many ways and it seems very contradictory when at this moment mr. Boris Johnson is hating to handle word this albeit British nationals whose nationality has been a strip so is Boris Johnson really saying that our laws in UK are not robust enough are they shallow and weak not to be able to you know have these criminals because they're criminals at the end of the day to go through the justice system and be imprisoned for a whole of life or whatever the sentence happens to be at that time and what we are doing if we follow mr. Boris Johnson's strategies that we are really franchising our justice system to the USA because USA has a death penalty and okay your previous commentator was saying that we don't know whether they will be sort of you know a death penalty would be passed to them because the trial has not happened but the reality is that we are losing our sovereignty and telling the world that Britain is not competent enough to really sort of put through criminals through the criminal justice system and then at the end of the day whatever punishment that needs to be meted out to them will be given well what do you think of that approach drones striking suspected jihadists basically for vengeance is that not medieval well I am against it it's not from go ahead mo yeah I'm against extrajudicial killing I think the Americans created a real difficult precedent when they killed the notable terrorists and while al Awlaki who was of American citizenship extrajudicial killing doesn't work we've had three previous conflicts as far as Britain is concerned in Afghanistan and that's when they coined the phrase mowing the lawn the idea was you've got to go back out once a generation every couple of generations and cut the grass back in case they come over here and attack us now firstly we've got no business being in Syria Assad has been a long-term ally of the west of amet Blair met the queen had a very cozy time when he came here and he's also you know an ally of the West is also an ally of Russia so we have a perfect storm there but I think extrajudicial killing is not the answer I would go for an enlightened approach I think there's some common ground between me and Phillip and I worked in prevent and on counter radicalization programs both nationally and locally at the outset and then became one of the harshest critics of it because we lost our way there's an onslaught against human rights now they are British citizens we need to deal with our rubbish we've got to bring them home if they are capable of being D radicalized and we can deal with them like they do in some of the Nordic countries and some of the Scandinavian countries and reintegrate them into British society great if they can't we try them whether that's in public whether that's in private where that's in secret put them in prison throw away the keys I'll be the first to I'll be the first to sign up to that idea but the idea that we somehow our vassal state of the u.s. that our detention system doesn't work that we cannot handle these chaps who need to be brought back here and Families don't forget the first guy who died out in Syria was a chap a young chap from Portsmouth who went out there on a humanitarian basis became embroiled in the conflict ended up being a chef out there and kept an online diary for nine months and then was thrown into conflict and died now has he been convicted has he been tried what is he guilty of the this we are in a fourth generation of warring over to Philip and give him a chance to respond to that sure go ahead Philip I'm just saying that this is something who doesn't understand conflict you know how do you go in and arrest these people and bring them back in a nice little police car to be put in a cosy cell to then go through a judicial system there in the conflict zone and when there are a clear and present danger to the safety of United Kingdom because the radicalizing more people are on line to go out there or they're trying to stir up attacks in the United Kingdom there are a threat to this country so the legitimate military targets Boris Johnson said first and foremost that they justify to us as a legitimate military target but whenever you you attack someone whether it be from a fixed-wing aircraft whether it's a sniper or whether or whether it through a drone that's coming in there there are always additional consequences that come from it and that is sending a clear message okay lacrosse is killing we know where you are how killing them tackles on the bike they are removing them as a threat stopping stopping them radicalizing other people be it sends a message to other people that are out there saying we know where you are we can get you at any time so just you watch message stream then then it shortens the length of the conflict it saves lives tactics an awful lot which exposes more command and control systems other out there and it means without evidence fill it without evidence you have absolutely no idea the evidence in military targeting comes in from the intelligence services that are working I've been there I've sat and put targeted let you in to make sure how these things happen and there's an awful lot of care that's put into it damage whatsoever and the accuracy of these missions is very very good indeed so making points of substance and therefore you know putting a coherent argument across gents I'm afraid I'm gonna have to just briefly because daunted just very briefly there there are no substantive points are because this is the same political system the same counter-terrorist system that says there have been no civilian casualties we do not record we do not record if he runs his vc of one of my friends said we do not record we do not count civilian casualties we do not count collateral damage if there is believed to be we have very rare ability the respond no no no no no no no no no on the first series vote in parliament it was absolutely clear the MPs came forward and said we have no records we have no evidence and the reason is we do not count them if we kill somebody overseas whether it's Iraq Afghanistan or Syria it's up to the surviving family to sue the British or American government to get us to change the horizon you haven't and guess what it doesn't happen we have tens of thousands civilian casualties we don't even count don't tell me to trust this system because the system is broken shabbir what's your opinion on sensibility in terms of targeting you know Brits who've gone abroad to fight for Islamic state is it acceptable to be drone strike ignant well I just want to sort of move on to a little bit different as you know in the last few days over 400 white helmets activists in Syria has been taken out under escort by Israel to Jordan and there is some expectation that they would be given British nationality or the European nationalities these white helmets were working hand in hand with ISIL terrorists in Syria and if someone if tells me that white elements helmets were doing good work humanitarian work work of the nature to save human beings it's very clear from the evidence over the last six seven years in Syria that white helmets have been funded supported by the British government and by USA so at the end of the day on the one hand we are saying that terrorists should be taken out by drones and and other sort of firepower but on and at the same time we let go of over 400 white helmets terrorists who were operating in Syria to come back to the UK not only you just sort of doomed to be D radicalized but to be given nationality and to roam freely as some humanitarian workers this ice find this whole awful problem with the approach that is being taken about these two individuals and what mr. Boris Johnson has been talking about wiebe I'm glad to say gentle we were given a bit more time so let's continue our conversation Phillip on a pick up on a point you made earlier and it's also touches on something that most it's not always easy to know exactly who is to blame and to what extent the way that individuals who are out in Syria have been portrayed by the media sometimes by governments doesn't always paint an accurate picture does that mean that there need to be individual trials for everybody concerned no not really and I'm actually there is a very accurate picture built up whenever you're putting targeting packs together it's down to my new to my new detail remember the accuracy of the weapon systems that have been used are such that you can choose the window that your missile is going to fly through in a building you can take a room ITIN a building and the rooms next door are not going to be touched so you the accuracy of the intelligence picture that's put together is is phenomenal and within that you're sitting looking at collateral damage and you do count any collateral damage that there is both from the reports that you're getting from your sources that you have that are feeding you the information in the first place and your post attack analysis that you do and you you you there are a lot of resources put into doing that so you can make sure that any collateral damage is minimized and you want to know that you've got the primary target that's there the white helmets their association with being with Isis terrorists I think that is just fundamentally wrong you don't think Israel is going to extract your associate I've been helping them escape if it was fundamentally wrong I will not be helping out okay the white the white about of out of bombed our buildings they weren't killing people 30 seconds left no final word to you I think Philip seems too sure thank very much Philip and many of the others on the neoconservative right seem to be living in this weird dystopian reality where war isn't messy where enemy combatants are clearly identifiable in uniforms when they're not where they're not housed in civilian populations where we've seen from Iraq and Afghanistan that the the annual yeah actually the actually of drone strikes is 2 percent 2 percent is actually drone strike actually of air strikes is 20 percent we are mowing down innocent people by their drone we need a more enlightened approach and the idea that missile is gonna crawl through your letterbox and land on your lap is a load of nonsense and you should know better denial ain't just a river okay gonna have to wrap it up there gents so I know how it works and I'd like to thank my guests left to right shall be a raspberry political analyst former intelligence security officer Phillip Ingram and political and social competition moments are many thanks guys you
