good evening from New York I'm Chris Hayes the people closest to the President of the United States are sending flashing red warning signals the American people about the danger this man poses to the nation tonight the New York Times published a stunning op eds senior administration official whose identity is known to the newspaper which describes a resistance within the administration in which the author and others are working behind the scenes in the author's conception to save the country from the president quote we believe our first duty is to this country and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our Republic that is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office that is of course entirely consistent with journalist Bob Woodward's account of the Trump administration in his new book and with just about every single tell-all and blind quote published in the last year and a half all conveying that the officials who know the president best around him every day talk to him constantly think he is unfit for the office he holds they just won't come out and say it publicly by the way if any of those officials are watching we'd love to have you on this show just call up our control room they'll patch you right through we'll talk according to the op-eds anonymous author the president's own cabinet consider trying to remove him from office I quote again given the instability many witnessed there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th amendment which would start a complex process for removing the president but no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis so we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until one way or another it's over until one way or another it's over sure makes you wonder what ways they might have in mind what they think might be coming down soon the White House released a statement highlighting the president's electoral college win slamming the op-ed author as gutless anonymous source and a coward but an hour after I was published the president appeared in a White House event with a group of sheriffs and put on a display that did nothing to contradict the characterizations of his temperament either in the editorial or the Woodward book we have somebody in what I call the failing New York Times that's talking about he's part of the resistance within the Trump administration this is what we have to deal with and you know the dishonest media because you people deal with it as well as I do but it's really a disgrace I will say this nobody has done what this administration has done in terms of getting things passed and getting things through a article was just printed just came out a few minutes ago Trump breaks the record for budget gridlock wins so if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial can you believe it anonymous meaning gutless I've got no senatorial we're doing a great job the poll numbers are through the roof our poll numbers are great and guess what nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 trying me out talk about today's extraordinary developments senator chris murphy of connecticut senator the last time that you were on i said something like this is unstained sustainable and untenable and unbearable the the the situation we are in and it's only gotten worse what are we seeing right now well this is the latest act in you know what is continuing three-ring circus it's weakening America all over the world and you know frankly pushing a lot of people away from politics and civic participation you know listen at the same time you know this is this this article in The New York Times is a little bit hard to understand I understand that you know they may be trying to rationalize and justify working with someone that they perceive to be deeply immoral but you know history is replete with individuals who after the fact tried to justify working for a regime that they deeply disagreed with and history has not passed the kind judgement on that and I'm not saying that the Trump administration is Vichy France but we know how this goes down after the fact well this is this this gets to something that op-ed talks about that has been sort of the constant central conundrum which is that the president's instincts and his rhetoric and his behavior are obviously wholly outside the bounds of and the rule of law frankly but he has been rather impotent in many ways in imposing that will on the institution's an example this is the president's tweet just now the president United States in response to the op-ed does the so-called senior administration official really exist or is it just the failing near ties with another phony source if the gutless anonymous person does indeed exist the times must for national security purposes turn him over to the government at once yeah well that's not happening that's not happening he's certainly implying that there's some legal repercussions for telling a story to the New York Times which of course there isn't under any federal law that I know of but yeah these kind of threats are often just that they're just rhetoric they're just threats they're just trying to scare others into into silence but you know ultimately this individuals name is not going to be turned over to the White House right I guess the question is I mean you said this the other day we had you on the program I talked about the the legitimacy of the president and and and the degree to which that's called the question you made this point that I thought was interesting is it's dangerous to talk about legitimacy in this sort of nebulous space when there are constitutional remedies the constitutional remedies of the 25th amendment and Pietschmann 25th amendment discovered in this and a lot of people are watching saying what is the tripwire here what do we have to see what has to be waved in front of the American people that gets Congress that point and maybe it's just a question of which party controls it so you know as someone who is leading the resistance to Donald Trump let me introduce another subtlety here which is that Donald Trump didn't disguise who he was during the campaign now Donald Trump didn't run a campaign in which he advertised himself as a deeply stable thoughtful nuanced thinker America had a pretty good idea that they were electing someone who was reckless and divisive who was going to govern by the scene of his pants and so that creates another question for the Democratic checks that exist on a president who may be out of control if the American public chose an individual that they knew to be reckless does that give permission to the legislative branch to remove and I think those are all questions that if we ever get to that moment which we're having that conversation about an impeachment power will we'll have to put on the table well and there's also the fact that as this happens I mean as we watch this play out right on Capitol Hill today you know it's this bizarre spectacle of business as usual right so the president after the the sort of unprecedented obstruction by Mitch McConnell keeping Merrick garland from even having hearings this president who people around him are running to every reporter and a fat bitch they can to send the warning signals has hand-selected this individual who comes before the community day to testify and it's all just as if we're supposed to I guess just say well this yeah this is just how it goes right and and and this really won't stop unless Republicans unless members of his own party start doing meaningful things to stand up to him and stop his agenda and by and large what you have seen is a lot of rhetoric that runs counter to the president's to the way that the president talks and people willing to talk anonymously about their work inside the administration the fact of the matter is the person who wrote this piece is working inside the White House to soften the edges of the presidency to make him more palatable to the electorate to in fact increase the chances that he's going to get a second term that is the same thing that Republicans do behind closed doors in Congress who tell you that they have deep personal and moral disagreements with the president are doing in pushing his agenda through so again none of this really changes unless Republicans are willing to do more than just put anonymous pieces in the New York Times what what are the stakes of the midterms for you I mean I think democracy is on the ballot you know I think Trump has been poking and prodding democratic norms and I think if he feels as if the electorate essentially endorses and vouches for the way that he has conducted himself the ways in which he has challenged those norms in the first two years the rains come off and I think you will you will see him fire Muller you will see him start to disobey court orders you may actually see him take even more meaningful actions against the press iiiii listen I I don't want to be too apocryphal about this moment but I do think that there's a chance that he will come away from a win in the midterms feeling as if he has been empowered by the electorate to take the next step on these assaults on the democracy itself all right senator chris murphy thank you for making some time tonight thanks hey there I'm Chris Hayes
