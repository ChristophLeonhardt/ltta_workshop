1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,310
These are two of the most recognizable photos
from World War II.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,299
The one on the left is "Raising the Flag on
Iwo Jima" by Joe Rosenthal.

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:12,770
It shows US Marines raising the American flag
on top of Mount Suribachi following the Battle

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,459
of Iwo Jima in Japan.

5
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:18,690
The one on the right is “Raising a Flag
over the Reichstag” by Yevgeny Khaldei.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,550
It shows a young Russian soldier planting
the Soviet flag on the roof of the former

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,670
German Parliament building.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,590
It was taken in the heart of burned-out Berlin
after Russians captured the city and the Nazis

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,530
were ultimately defeated.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,570
The two photos are similar: They’re both
huge symbols of victory for their respective

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,620
countries, and they’re both taken after
the fights were over, when the armies lifted

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,100
larger flags to replace the smaller ones raised
during battle.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,510
But the Russian one is different.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,059
For one, it’s staged.

15
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:49,940
Unlike Rosenthal’s candid snapshot, Khaldei’s
is carefully posed.

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,890
Plus, parts of it were altered before it was
published.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,850
This is the photo that became iconic —

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,719
and this is the original.

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,910
See the difference?

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,350
Khaldei superimposed some black smoke from
another photo and manipulated the contrast

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,069
to give the scene a little more drama.

22
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,539
But there’s something else, and you have
to look really close or you might miss it.

23
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:10,720
See it yet?

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,500
It’s right here.

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,940
What happened to this guy’s watch?

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,040
Hitler’s invasion of Russia in June 1941
— code-named Operation Barbarossa — was

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,180
ruthless and prolonged, and ended in millions
of Russian being killed, including women and

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,680
children.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,680
The German army committed brutal atrocities,
including burnings, rape, and sanctioned mass

30
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:36,779
murder of civilians.

31
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:40,279
“They weren’t soldiers, and they weren’t
killed in battle.

32
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:42,349
Mass murder by orders of the High Command.”

33
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:45,979
“The bodies of hundreds of civilians were
found in an anti-tank ditch.

34
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,579
People who had been slaughtered en masse by
the execution squads.”

35
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,569
So when the tide of the war changed in the
Russians’ favor in 1942, they saw an opportunity

36
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:55,520
for revenge.

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,099
In the Russians’ final onslaught against
Germany in April 1945, Stalin ordered his

38
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,470
marshals to race to Berlin at all costs — even
though he’d committed to sharing the capital

39
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,480
city’s capture with his allies.

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,000
This recklessness resulted in needlessly high
casualties for the Russians, in some instances

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,840
from bombarding their own army amid all the
confusion.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,060
The Red Army stormed across Eastern Europe
and, just like the Germans had done, committed

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,390
civilian murder, burnings, mass rapes, and
looting – acts that they saw as vengeance

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,390
for their countrymen …

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,590
… and acts that go largely undiscussed in
Russia to this day.

46
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,190
Which brings us back to Khaldei’s photo.

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,020
An iconic victory photo would have been a
boon for Soviet public image around the world,

48
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,430
and Soviet officials, possibly even Stalin
himself, wanted it to be in Berlin.

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,050
It would be their answer to Rosenthal’s
Iwo Jima photo, which had published a few

50
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,240
months earlier and became a beloved symbol
of American triumph.

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,190
The image even appeared on this propaganda
poster, which helped raise over $26 billion

52
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,100
for the American war effort in 1945.

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,210
So after the fighting in Berlin had ended,
Khaldei was flown in from Moscow with his

54
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,440
camera and an enormous Soviet flag sewn from
three tablecloths.

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,150
He gathered a couple of nearby soldiers to
pose on the Reichstag’s roof and shot a

56
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,020
full roll of 36 photos ...

57
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,860
… ultimately choosing this one.

58
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,010
But there was a problem.

59
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,040
The soldier supporting the flag bearer was
wearing two watches, suggesting he had been

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,370
looting — a stain that didn’t fit the
image of Soviet heroism that Stalin wanted.

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,180
So Khaldei scratched it out with a needle
…

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,380
… and this was how it appeared when it first
published in a popular Russian magazine a

63
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,300
week and a half later.

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,790
This historic moment on top of the Reichstag
is actually reimagined in the 2015 movie Child

65
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,790
44.

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,630
The facts are exaggerated, but the reference
is clear.

67
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,330
“Now let’s show the people how Berlin
has fallen to the Red Army!”

68
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,420
“Lose the goddamn watches!”

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,760
“What?”

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
“Take them off!

71
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,180
Stolen watches.

72
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,980
They can’t be seen.”

73
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,640
This photo shows a lot of things.

74
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,330
It shows a reenactment of a historic moment
on top of the Reichstag, the symbolic seat

75
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,330
of German power.

76
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,830
It represents triumph and pride: the Soviet
victory over their fascist invaders after

77
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,650
a hard-fought and bloody war.

78
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,769
But, unintentionally, it also captures and
then conceals a story of vengeance and mutual

79
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,069
brutality.

80
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:28,540
Of murder, organized destruction, and pillaging,
all culminating in this iconic moment.

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,540
There's some speculation that what was edited out of this photo

82
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,200
wasn't a second watch, but actually a wrist-worn compass.

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,600
It was called the Adrianov compass and it was widely used by the Soviet army.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:00:00,000
But if that's all it was, why'd they scratch it out?
