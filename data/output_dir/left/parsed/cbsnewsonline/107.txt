LIKE THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT IT. 
THE DEBATE IS OVER. 
>>>  WE INTERRUPT TO TAKE YOU 
TO SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS AT 
THE PODIUM. 
>> THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA 
HAS FOLLOWED THROUGH ON HIS 
COMMITMENT TO RETURN THE FIRST 
SET OF REMAINS OF AMERICANS TO 
OUR HOMELAND. 
THESE BRAVE SOULS DESERVE 
NOTHING BUT OUR HONOR AND 
RSPECT. 
THE FAMILIES OF THESE SOLDIERS 
HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MORE THAN 
60 YEARS FOR THEIR LOVED ONES 
TO COME HOME. 
WE HOPE THAT AS REMAINS ARE 
IDENTIFIED FAMILIES LIKE THOSE 
OF COMMANDER JOHN C. McKEIL CAN 
FIND PEACE. 
JOHN WAS NAVY -- ASSIGNED  TO 
NAVY SQUADRON 125 AND KILLED 
WHILE LEADING A MISSION INTO 
NORTH KOREA. 
DOUG'S NEPHEW DOUG WHO LIVES IN 
MINNESOTA RECENTLY WROTE THE 
PRESIDENT A LETTER EXPLAINING 
HOW HIS UNCLE WAS A SPECIAL 
PERSON WHO GREW UP IN THE GREAT 
DEPRESSION AND WANTED TO SERVE 
HIS COUNTRY. 
ANOTHER LETTER FROM MARY IN 
PENNSYLVANIA TELLS THE 
PRESIDENT OF HER UNCLE CORPORAL 
ANDREW BOYER WHO HAS BEEN 
MISSING IN ACTION IN KOREA 
SINCE SEPTEMBER OF 1951. 
MARY HAS A PICTURE OF HER UNCLE 
HANGING IN HER LIVING ROOM AS A 
REMINDER OF HIS COMMITMENT AND 
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. 
BOTH OF THESE MEN AND THEIR 
FAMILIES REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF 
PROUD PATRIOTIC AMERICAN 
FAMILIES. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS COMMITTED TO 
THEM AND WILL WORK TO BRING 
THEM THE CLOSURE THEY DESERVE. 
ON ANOTHER MATTER, WE HAVE SEEN 
ALL OF THE ALARMING IMAGES OF 
THE WILDFIRES CAUSING SEVERE 
DAMAGE OUT WEST. 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND FEMA HAVE 
BEEN ACTIVELY MONITORING THE 
WILDFIRES TO ENSURE THAT 
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED 
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 
ON SATURDAY THE PRESIDENT 
DECLARED THAT AN EMERGENCY 
EXISTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA 
WILDFIRES. 
AS A RESULT FEMA HAS PLACED 
RESOURCES FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT 
FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND 
AGENCIES TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS 
OF LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS AND 
RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR THIS ONGOING EMERGENCY 
AND MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE OF 
CALIFORNIA RECEIVE THE 
ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO KEEP 
THEM SAFE AND RECOVER. 
OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE 
FIREFIGHTERS WHO RECENTLY LOST 
THEIR LIVES BATTLING THESE 
FIRES AND THEIR GRIEVING 
FAMILIES. 
LASTLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE ONGOING 
SITUATION IN TURKEY INVOLVING 
PASTOR ANDREW BRUNSON. 
WE'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT 
PASTOR BRUNSON HAS DONE 
ANYTHING WRONG AND WE BELIEVE 
HE IS A VICTIM OF UNFAIR AND 
UNJUST ATTENTION BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY. 
AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION, 
THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY IS 
SANCTIONING TURKEY'S MINISTER 
OF JUSTICE AND MINISTER OF 
INTERIOR, BOTH OF WHOM PLAYED 
LEADING ROLES IN THE ARREST AND 
DETENTION OF PASTOR BRUNSON. 
AS A RESULT, ANY PROPERTY OR 
INTEREST IN PROPERTY OF BOTH 
MINISTERS WITHIN U.S. 
JURISDICTION IS BLOCKED AND 
U.S. PERSONS ARE GENERALLY 
PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN 
TRANSACTIONS WITH THEM. 
FOR ANYTHING FURTHER, I WOULD 
REFER YOU TO THE TREASURY 
DEPARTMENT ON THAT FRONT. 
AND WITH THAT I WILL TAKE YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 
ZEKE. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
JUST A QUICK NOTE, THE PRESS 
CORPS LAST MONTH BRIEFING WITH 
YOU TOTALING UNDER AN HOUR. 
 WE'D APPRECIATE 
 THE PRESIDENT'S 
TWEET THIS MORNING ABOUT 
DIRECTION JEFF SESSIONS ASKING 
HIM TO END THE MUELLER PROBE 
RIGHT NOW. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID A FEW WEEKS 
AGO -- OR TWO MONTHS AGO, 
SORRY, THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO 
INTERVENE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE INVESTIGATION. 
DOES THAT TWEET INDICATE A 
CHANGE IN POSTURE BY THE 
PRESIDENT? 
>> IT'S NOT AN ORDER, IT'S THE 
PRESIDENT'S OPINION AND IT'S 
RIDICULOUS THAT ALL OF THE 
CORRUPTION AND DISHONESTY 
THAT'S GONE ON WITH THE 
LAUNCHING OF THE WITCH HUNT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS WATCHED THIS 
PROCESS PLAY OUT, BUT HE ALSO 
WANTS TO SEE IT COME TO AN END 
AS HE STATED MANY TIMES. 
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT 
HAPPENING. 
>>REPORTER:  ON A DIFFERENT 
TOPIC HERE, YOU MENTIONED THAT 
THE TRANSFER OF THESE REMAINS 
FROM NORTH KOREA  
THERE WAS A REPORT YESTERDAY 
THAT NORTH KOREA IS STILL 
DISASSEMBLING ICBMs, IT'S NOT 
YET POSSIBLE TO VERIFY THE 
REMAINS HUMAN OR AMERICAN, HOW 
DOES THAT SORT OF MEET THE TEST 
OF NORTH KOREA FULFILLING ITS 
COMMITMENT THAT IT MADE IN 
SINGAPORE? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON 
THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION 
ON ANY POTENTIAL INTELLIGENCE 
MATTER. 
IN TERMS OF THE REMAINS, WE 
HAVE THE BEST OF THE BEST THAT 
HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER THE LAST 
SEVERAL WEEKS ON THIS PROCESS. 
WE'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON IT. 
BUT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE 
ASSESSMENT THAT THEY'VE MADE UP 
UNTIL THIS POINT. 
JOHN. 
>> SARAH, ON THE NEXT PROPOSED 
TARIFFS AGAINST CHINA, THE 
FIGURE INITIALLY FOR TARIFFS 
WAS 10%, BUT IT'S OUR 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT NOW WANTS TO TAKE 
THAT UP TO 25%. 
WHAT'S THE REASON BEHIND 
INCREASING IT FROM 10% TO 25%, 
AND IN A FOR TAF, IT YOU WANT 
TO CALL IT TRADE WAR, SOMETHING 
ELSE, WHO HAS MORE BULLETS, 
CHINA OR THE UNITED STATES? 
>> THE PRESIDENT FIRMLY 
BELIEVES THAT THE UNITED STATES 
CERTAINLY DOES -- WILL HAVE AN 
-- THE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY 
DOES. 
THERE WILL BE AN UPDATE LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON AND A CALL AT 
3:30 THIS AFTERNOON TO WALK 
THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THAT 
UPDATE IN REGARDS TO THE 
QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT 10 TO 
25. 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO CONTINUE 
TO HOLD CHINA RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THEIR UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES. 
THIS HAS GONE ON FOR LONG 
ENOUGH AND HE'S GOING TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 
>>REPORTER:  DOES THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVE -- 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  I WAS JUST GOING 
TO SAY, THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 
SOME HEADWAY WITH THE E.U. 
IN TERMS OF LOWERING TRADE 
BARRIERS, TAKING STEPS TOWARD 
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM 
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS POSSIBLE 
WITH CHINA WITHOUT TAKING SOME 
REAL PUNITIVE MEASURES? 
>> CERTAINLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE 
THE PLAYING FIELD LEVELED. 
THE PRESIDENT, AS BOTH HE AND I 
THINK ABOUT 15 MEMBERS OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION HAVE SAID 
REPEATEDLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE 
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES STOP. 
BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HOLD 
THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE. 
HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUT 
PRESSURE ON CHINA AND HE'S NOT 
GOING TO SIT BACK AND ALLOW 
AMERICAN INDUSTRIES AND 
AMERICAN WORKERS TO BE TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE OF. 
DAVE. 
>>REPORTER:  SARAH, CHURCHES 
AROUND THE COUNTRY, SYNAGOGUES, 
SOME SCWRALG LEADERS HAVE BEEN 
UP IN ARM -- EVANGELICAL 
LEADERS HAVE BEEN UP IN ARMS 
ABOUT LAST YEAR'S TAX CUT LAWS. 
THEY SAY THERE'S A PROVISION IN 
THERE THAT'S GOING TO FORCE 
THEM TO PAY A NEW 21% FEDERAL 
INCOME TAX ON THE BENEFITS THEY 
GIVE CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. 
CAN YOU ASSURE CHURCHES FROM 
THE PODIUM THERE THAT THEY'RE 
NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A NEW 
TAX? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A 
BLANKET GENERALIZATION ABOUT 
EVERY CHURCH IN AMERICA, BUT 
CERTAINLY THE GOAL OF THE TAX 
CUTS AND REFORMS PACKAGE WAS TO 
PROVIDE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF 
RELIEF TO THE GREATEST NUMBER 
OF AMERICANS, AND WE FEEL THAT 
IT'S DONE THAT. 
WE FEEL THAT THE OTHER POLICIES 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT 
FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
ECONOMY HAVE CERTAINLY MOVED 
THE BALL FORWARD, MADE OUR 
ECONOMY INFINITILY STRONGER 
THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DECADES, 
AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT BY 
ALL OF THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE 
COME OUT OVER THE LAST YEAR AND 
A HALF. 
HUNTER. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 
TRADITIONALLY TAX-EXEMPT GROUP, 
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT PREPARED 
TO DO TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP 
THEIR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS? 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 
SPECIFIC ON THAT FRONT. 
>>REPORTER:  ANY THREATENING 
LETTER OR COMMUNICATION AIMED 
AT IMPEDING A CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION CONSTITUTES 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. 
RUDY GIULIANI ISSUED A 
STATEMENT SAYING HE DOESN'T 
THINK THIS MORNING'S TWEET IS 
OBSTRUCTION BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT SAID SESSIONS SHOULD 
STOP THE MUELLER PROBE RATHER 
THAN ORDERING HIM TO HALT IT. 
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS RUDY 
GIULIANI THE ONE GIVING THE 
PRESIDENT LEGAL ADVICE ON HIS 
TWEETS, AND DOES THAT STATEMENT 
REFLECT THE OPINION OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM? 
>> LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 
OBSTRUCTING, HE'S FIGHTING 
BACK. 
THE PRESIDENT IS STATING HIS 
OPINION, HE'S STATING IT 
CLEARLY, AND HE'S CERTAINLY 
EXPRESSING THE FRUSTRATION THAT 
HE HAS WITH THE LEVEL OF 
CORRUPTION THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM 
PEOPLE LIKE JAMES COMEY, PETER 
STRZOK, ANDREW McCABE. 
THERE'S A REASON THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS ANGRY, AND, 
FRANKLY, MOST OF AMERICA IS 
ANGRY AS WELL, AND THERE'S NO 
REASON HE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO 
VOICE THAT OPINION. 
MARGARET. 
SORRY. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING. 
MARGARET, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  TESLA PLANS TO 
SPEND $5 BILLION TO OPEN A 
PLANT IN CHINA. 
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S NOT GOING 
TO AFFECT OPERATIONS IN THE 
U.S., BUT I'M WONDERING IF THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAS ANY CONCERNS 
ABOUT TESLA'S PLANS. 
>> CERTAINLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE 
COMPANIES INVESTING HERE, WE 
DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC 
INFORMATION ON TESLA. 
BUT WE'D LIKE ALL THEM TO BUILD 
IN AMERICA AND NOT HELP ENGAGE 
AND BOLSTER A COUNTRY LIKE 
CHINA THAT HAS CONTINUED TO BE 
A PART OF A VERY UNFAIR PROCESS 
AND VERY UNFAIR TRADING 
PRACTICES. 
JOHN. 
>> THANKS A LOT, SARAH. 
WE SAW REACTION FROM THE 
PRESIDENT'S TWEETS TODAY FROM 
SOME OF HIS ALLIES ON CAPITOL 
HILL. 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR HATCH SAID I 
DON'T FULLY GET WHAT HE'S 
TRYING TO DO AND ANOTHER 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR SAID THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO 
MOVE FORWRD. 
HE SAID THEY OUGHT TO LET THEM 
COMPLETE THEIR WORK. 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
SENTIMENT EXPRESSED BY SENATOR 
THUNE THAT THIS INVESTIGATION 
BY MR. MUELLER OUGHT TO BE 
COMPLETED AND NOT SORT OF CUT 
OFF? 
>> WE CERTAINLY THINK IT SHOULD 
BE COMPLETED. 
WE'D LIKE IT TO BE COMPLETED 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. 
IT'S GONE ON FOR AN EXTENSIVE 
AMOUNT OF TIME. 
THEY STILL COME UP WITH NOTHING 
IN REGARDS TO THE PRESIDENT. 
WE'D LIKE TO SEE IT COME TO A 
CLOSE. 
WE'VE SAID THAT A NUMBER OF 
TIMES. 
SO, SURE, WE ACTUALLY AGREE ON 
THAT FRONT. 
CECELIA. 
WE'RE TIGHT ON TIME BECAUSE THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE 
SPEAKING. 
CECELIA, GO AHEAD. 
JOHN, JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TIGHT 
ON TIME, I'LL TRY TO GET TO AS 
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL 
BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE VOTING 
ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY. 
IS THAT THE PUSH FOR THE 
REQUIRING VOTER ID'S? 
>> EVEN IF THERE ARE 10 PEOPLE 
VOTING ILLEGALLY IT SHOULDN'T 
HAPPEN. 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SEE THE 
INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS 
SYSTEM UPHELD AND THAT'S THE 
PURPOSE OF HIS COMMENTS. 
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT 
ANYBODY THAT'S VOTING IS 
SOMEBODY THAT SHOULD BE VOTING 
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING 
THAT FRANKLY SHOULD BE 
CELEBRATED, NOT DISCRIMINATED. 
MAJOR. 
>>REPORTER:  WHEN IS THE LAST 
TIME THE PRESIDENT WENT TO A 
GROCERY STORE? 
>> I'M NOT SURE. 
I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT MATTERS 
EITHER. 
MAJOR, GO AHEAD. 
>> HE SAID LAST NIGHT ABOUT THE 
GROCERY STORE. 
>> I'VE HE BEEN TO THE GROCERY 
STORE, I'VE NEVER HAD TO SHOW 
AN I.D. 
WHEN I GO TO BUY GROCERIES. 
>> CERTAINLY IF YOU GO TO A 
GROCERY STORE AND YOU BUY BEER 
AND WINE, YOU'RE CERTAINLY 
GOING TO SHOW YOUR I.D. 
I DON'T THINK -- 
>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T DRINK. 
>> HE'S NOT SAYING EVERY TIME 
WHEN HE WENT IN. 
HE SAID EVERY TIME WHEN YOU GO 
TO THE GROCERY STORE. 
I'M PRETTY SURE EVERYBODY 
THAT'S IN HERE THAT'S GONE TO A 
GROCERY STORE AND HAS PURCHASED 
BEER OR WINE HAS HAD TO SHOW 
THEIR I.D. 
AND IF THEY DIDN'T, THAT'S 
PROBABLY A PROBLEM WITH THE 
úGR 
MAJOR, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  TO FOLLOW UP ON 
JOHN DECKER'S QUESTION, YOU 
WANT THE INVESTIGATION TO END. 
YOU WANT IT TO END I PRESUME 
ALSO WITHOUT ANY OBSTRUCTION, 
MEANING WITHOUT ANY 
INTERFERENCE. 
MANY HAVE DESCRIBED THE 
PRESIDENT'S TWEET THIS MORNING 
AS BLOWING OFF STEAM. 
IS THAT A FAIR 
CHARACTERIZATION? 
IT'S JUST AN OPINION HE'S 
THROWING OUT THERE, IT HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS ACTUAL 
GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF OR 
SUPERVISION OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> ONCE AGAIN, AS I SAID 
EARLIER, THE PRESIDENT IS 
STATING HIS OPINION. 
IT'S NOT AN ORDER, BUT HE'S 
BEEN I THINK CRYSTAL CLEAR 
ABOUT HOW HE FEELS ABOUT THIS 
INVESTIGATION FROM THE 
BEGINNING. 
SARAH. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU JUST SAID A 
MOMENT AGO THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION ITSELF IS 
CORRUPT, THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION, AND THEN YOU 
MENTIONED COMEY AND McCABE AND 
STRZOK. 
STRZOK CERTAINLY -- HE WAS FOR 
A TIME -- 
>> THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION IS 
BASED OFF OF A DIRTY 
DISCREDITED DOSSIER THAT WAS 
PAID FOR BY AN OPPOSING 
CAMPAIGN AND HAD A LOT OF 
CORRUPTION WITHIN THE ENTITY 
WHICH WAS OVERSEEING IT WHICH 
WAS PETER STRZOK, JAMES COMEY, 
ANDREW McCABE. 
WE'VE LAID THIS OUT A NUMBER OF 
TIMES. 
I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE TO 
GO INTO IT EVERY SINGLE TIME 
WE'RE IN HERE. 
>>REPORTER:  IF IT'S CORRUPT, 
WHY DOESN'T THE PRESIDENT JUST 
END IT OR USE HIS POWERS? 
IF HE BELIEVES THAT, WHY 
DOESN'T HE FOLLOW THROUGH ON 
THAT? 
>> ONCE AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT 
HAS ALLOWED THIS PROCESS TO 
PLAY OUT, BUT HE THINKS IT'S 
TIME FOR IT TO COME TO AN END. 
SARAH, GO AHEAD. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD 
CLARIFY THE TWEET FROM THIS 
MORNING. 
IS IT THE PRESIDENT'S DESIRE 
FOR SESSIONS TO UNRECUSE 
HIMSELF FROM THE PROBE, AND IS 
IT ALSO HIS DESIRE FOR THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL TO BE FIRED ? 
>> I THINK I'VE CLARIFIED THIS 
ABOUT 10 TIMES NOW. 
IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S OPINION. 
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER. 
STEVE. 
>> YES, SARAH, LAST NIGHT AT 
THE TAMPA RALLY THE PRESIDENT 
AGAIN PUSHED FOR CREATION OF A 
SPACE FORCE AS A NEW MILITARY 
BRANCH. 
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TODAY 
MISSED A DEADLINE TO SUBMIT A 
REPORT TO CONGRESS ABOUT HOW 
THIS SPACE FORCE IS TO BE 
STRUCTURED, AND WE'RE TOLD NOW 
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TWICE 
REJECTED DRAFTS BECAUSE THE 
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T WANT 
A SPACE FORCE, IT WOULD RATHER 
CREATE A SPACE COMMAND UNDER 
THE EXISTING MILITARY 
STRUCTURE. 
IN VIEW OF THIS, HOW IS THE 
PRESIDENT GOING TO FORCE THE 
CREATION OF A SPACE FORCE? 
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK 
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
TO FIGURE OUT AND DETERMINE THE 
BEST WAY FORWARD, SOMETHING THE 
PRESIDENT FEELS STRONGLY ABOUT, 
AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH 
OUR TEAM THERE AND FIGURE OUT 
THE BEST SOLUTION. 
>>REPORTER:  I HAVE A QUESTION 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT IS MEETING 
WITH INNER CITY PASTORS. 
TODAY SECRETARY CARSON HAD 
PUSHED POLICIES THAT WOULD 
RAISE THE RENT ON MANY POOR 
PEOPLE. 
HE'S ALSO PUSHED POLICIES OF A 
SLOW ANTI-IMMIGRATION 
INITIATIVE. 
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT GOING TO 
SAY TO THESE INNER CITY PASTORS 
WHOSE AREAS MIGHT BE HURT BY 
SOME OF THESE POLICIES? 
>> CERTAINLY THAT'S A REASON TO 
SIT DOWN WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS 
TO HEAR THEIR FEEDBACK, HEAR 
THEIR CONCERNS. 
I KNOW THE PRIMARY POINT OF 
DISCUSSION FOR TODAY IS TO 
DISCUSS PRISON REFORM, BUT I 
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY 
RAISED THOSE ISSUES AND THAT'S 
WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS INVITED 
THEM HERE SO THAT HE CAN HAVE 
THOSE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND 
DETERMINE HOW BEST TO HELP THEM 
IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 
SITUATIONS. 
I'M SORRY? 
>> ARE THOSE POLICIES THAT ARE 
RAISING RENTS ON POOR PEOPLE 
AND THAT ARE SLOWING ANTI-
SEGREGATION INITIATIVES, ARE 
THEY HELPING INNER CITIES IN 
THE PRESIDENT'S OPINION? 
>> I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 
POLICIES YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY 
REFERENCING, AND I'D BE HAPPY 
TO DO THAT AFTER THE BRIEFING. 
JULIE. 
>> A NUMBER ARE TALKING ABOUT 
CUTS TO THE REFUGEE 
RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS 
CAPPED AT 45,000 BUT I'M TOLD 
IS UNDER DISCUSSIONS FOR CUTS 
TO 25,000 THIS YEAR. 
DOES THIS PRESIDENT FEEL THAT 
THIS COUNTRY ADMITS TOO MANY 
REFUGEES? 
WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR 
SCALING IT BACK? 
>> IT'S PART OF AN ONGOING 
DISCUSSION AND NO POLICY 
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE. 
BUT WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED AS 
THEY ARE. 
JEFF. 
>>REPORTER:  DOES THE PRESIDENT 
THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY 
REFUGEES COMEING INTO THIS 
COUNTRY? 
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE 
SURE WHOEVER COMES INTO THE 
COUNTRY WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE 
AND WHY THEY'RE COMING AND THAT 
THEY POSE NO DANGER OR THREAT 
TO AMERICANS. 
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
HAVE THE PROCESSES IN PLACE AND 
THE ABILITY TO VET ANY 
INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD COME INTO 
THIS COUNTRY IF THE DEPARTMENT 
OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND OTHER 
AGENCIES THAT THEY WOULD WORK 
IN COORDINATION WITH DETERMINED 
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO VET A CERTAIN 
NUMBER, THEN CERTAINLY THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE CONCERNS 
WITH THAT. 
AGAIN, THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 
IS NATIONAL SECURITY AND MAKING 
SURE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
PROPERLY VET AND PROCESS ANY 
INDIVIDUAL THAT COMES INTO THIS 
COUNTRY. 
JEFF. 
>>REPORTER:  SARAH, YOU SAID 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THIS 
INVESTIGATION TO BE COMPLETED, 
BUT HE HAS NOT YET MADE THE 
DECISION IF HE WILL SIT DOWN 
WITH ROBERT MUELLER. 
ISN'T HE PART OF DRAGGING THIS 
OUT A BIT? 
AND ALSO, WHEN HE TELLS YOU 
SOMETHING PERSONALLY, DO YOU 
TAKE IT AS A DIRECTIVE OR DO 
YOU TAKE IT AS HIS OPINION? 
>> ON THE FIRST PART I WOULD 
REFER YOU TO THE PRESIDENT'S 
OUTSIDE COUNSEL ON SPECIFIC 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL. 
AND THE SECOND PART, I'M SORRY? 
>> YOU SAID HIS TWEET THIS 
MORNING WAS HIS OPINION. 
WHEN HE TELLS YOU SOMETHING AS 
A MEMBER OF HIS STAFF, HOW DO 
YOU KNOW IF IT'S A DIRECTIVE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OR IF IT'S 
SIMPLY HIS OPINION? 
>> THE PRESIDENT MAKES IT 
PRETTY CLEAR WHEN I'M HAVING 
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM. 
DAVID, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  HIS TWEET THIS 
MORNING SAID THAT HE WANTED TO 
-- IT WAS TIME FOR THE 
INVESTIGATION TO BE STOPPED. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT KNOW THAT 
JEFF SESSIONS CAN'T STOP THE 
INVESTIGATION OR HAS HE 
DIRECTED ROD ROSENSTEIN TO? 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY WELL 
AWARE OF HOW THE PROCESS WORKS. 
ONCE AGAIN, HE IS STATING HIS 
OPINION. 
DAVID. 
>>REPORTER:  WHAT DOES THE 
PRESIDENT PLAN TO DO 
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 3D PLASTIC 
GUNS AND HE HE SPOKEN TO THE 
N.R.A. 
ABOUT THIS ISSUE 
STEVE. 
>> IN THE CASE OF THE PASTOR IN 
TURKEY, HAS RAISED THIS 
DIRECTLY WITH PRESIDENT 
ERDOGAN? 
>> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE 
IMPRISONMENT OF PASTOR BRUNSON? 
YES. 
THEY'VE DISCUSSED IT ON SEVERAL 
OCCASIONS. 
>>REPORTER:  WAS HE UPSET ABOUT 
IT? 
>> I THINK YOU CAN SEE IN THE 
ACTIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
MADE TODAY THAT HE'S NOT HAPPY 
WITH TURKEY'S DECISION NOT TO 
RELEASE PASTOR. 
>>REPORTER:  POSSIBILITY OF A 
SHUTDOWN ON TAXES DOES THE 
PRESIDENT SUPPORT POSSIBLY 
RESTRUCTURING THE WAY CAPITAL 
GAINS ARE TAXED AND ON THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A SHUTDOWN, IS 
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT 
POTENTIALLY ENDORSING A 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BEFORE 
NOVEMBER'S ELECTIONS, AFTER 
NOVEMBER'S ELECTIONS OR BOTH? 
>> ON THE FIRST PART OF YOUR 
QUESTION, THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM 
VARIOUS PEOPLE. 
NO ADMINISTRATION POLICY HAS 
BEEN DETERMINED, BUT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS ASKED THE 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO TAKE A 
LOOK INTO IT. 
ON THE SECOND PART OF YOUR 
QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE 
SHUTDOWN, THE PRESIDENT ISN'T 
FOCUSED ON THE TIMING OF BEFORE 
OR AFTER THE ELECTION. 
HE'S FOCUSED ON THE RESULTS. 
HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS 
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. 
OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS 
COMPLETELY BROKEN AND HE'S 
BEGGING AND HAS BEEN FOR 
CONGRESS, PARTICULARLY 
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS TO STEP 
UP, DO THEIR JOB, STOP IK 
KICKING THE BALL DOWN -- STOP 
KICKING THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD 
AND ACTUALLY WORK WITH HIM TO 
FIX OUR SYSTEM. 
IT'S THAT SIMPLE. 
>>REPORTER:  DOES THE PRESIDENT 
HAVE A PERSONAL OPINION AS TO 
WHETHER OR NOT THE CURRENT 
SYSTEM WORKS? 
>> AGAIN, HE'S ASKED THE 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO LOOK 
INTO. 
DAVID. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
TWO QUICKIES ABOUT LAST NIGHT 
IN TAMPA. 
FIRST OF ALL, DOES THE 
PRESIDENT ENCOURAGE THE SUPPORT 
OF PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP LAST 
NIGHT IN THESE FRINGE GROUPS? 
AND SECONDLY, IS THE WHITE 
HOUSE WILLING TO SAY RIGHT NOW 
IN VIEW OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE 
OF OUR TV COLLEAGUES LAST NIGHT 
THAT IT IS WRONG FOR HIS MOST 
VOCAL SUPPORTERS TO BE MENACING 
TOWARDS JOURNALISTS DOING THEIR 
JOBS IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT 
OR IN ANY SITUATION? 
>> ON THE FIRST PART, THE 
PRESIDENT CONDEMNS AND 
DENOUNCES ANY GROUP THAT WOULD 
INCITE VIOLENCE AGAINST ANOTHER 
INDIVIDUAL AND CERTAINLY 
DOESN'T SUPPORT GROUPS THAT 
WOULD PROMOTE THAT TYPE OF 
BEHAVIOR. 
WE'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT A 
NUMBER OF TIMES SINCE THE 
BEGINNING OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION. 
ON THE SECOND PART OF YOUR 
QUESTION, THE PRESIDENT, AS I 
JUST SAID, DOES NOT SUPPORT 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ANYONE OR 
ANYTHING, AND WE'VE BEEN VERY 
CLEAR. 
EVERY SINGLE TIME WE'VE BEEN 
úA 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MEDIA, THE 
PRESIDENT DOES THINK THAT THE 
MEDIA HOLDS A RESPONSIBILITY. 
WE FULLY SUPPORT A FREE PRESS, 
BUT THERE ALSO COMES A HIGH 
LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY WITH 
THAT. 
THE MEDIA ROUTINELY REPORTS ON 
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND 
GOVERNMENT SECRETS THAT PUT 
LIVES IN DANGER AND RISK 
VALUABLE NATIONAL SECURITY 
TOOLS. 
THIS HAS HAPPENED BOTH IN OUR 
ADMINISTRATION AND IN PAST 
ADMINISTRATIONS. 
ONE OF THE WORST CASES WAS THE 
REPORTING ON THE U.S. ABILITY 
TO LISTEN TO OSAMA BIN LADEN'S 
SATELLITE PHONE IN THE LATE 
'90s. 
BECAUSE OF THAT REPORTING HE 
STOPPED USING THAT PHONE AND 
THE COUNTRY LOST VALUABLE 
INTELLIGENCE. 
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOW 
>>REPORTER:  TRYING TO GET THE 
BFTER AND YELLING THAT THE 
NETWORK SUCKS IS THAT RIGHT OR 
WRONG? 
>> WHAT WAS THE FIRST PART OF 
YOUR QUESTION? 
>>REPORTER:  I SAID NO ONE WAS 
BEING VIOLENT LAST NIGHT IN 
TERMS OF HITTING ANYBODY AND NO 
BROADCASTER WAS BROADCASTING 
STATE SECRETS. 
THEY WERE TRYING  TO DO 
STANDUPS AT PUBLIC RALLY AND 
YOU HAD PEOPLE TRYING  TO YELL 
OVER THEM, PREVENTING THEM FROM 
DOING THEIR JOBS AND YELLING 
THAT THEIR NETWORK SUCKS ON 
LIVE TV. 
DO YOU SUPPORT THAT OR NOT? 
>> WHILE WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT 
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, WE ALSO 
SUPPORT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND 
WE THINK THAT THOSE THINGS GO 
IN HAND. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU TALKED A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TWEETS 
EARLIER, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ALSO TWEETED ABOUT PAUL 
MANAFORT AND COMPARING HIS 
TREATMENT TO THAT OF ALCAPONE 
AND HE SEEMS TO SAY THAT HE 
TREATED UNFAIRLY. 
I GUESS FIRST OF ALL DOES THE 
PRESIDENT FEEL LIKE PAUL 
MANAFORT IS BEING TREATED 
UNFAIRLY AND WHEN HE TALKED 
ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF SOLITARY 
ONFINEMENT AND THE FACT THAT 
MANAFORT HASN'T BEEN CONVICTED 
YET, DOES THIS ADMINISTRATION 
HAVE A LARGER CONCERN ABOUT 
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT BEING USED 
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN 
CONVICTED OUTSIDE OF PAUL 
MANAFORT? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF A SPECIFIC 
POLICY POSITION THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION HOLDS ON THAT 
FRONT, CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT 
HAS BEEN CLEAR HE THINKS PAUL 
MANAFORT HAS BEEN TREATED 
UNFAIRLY. 
STEVE. 
>> I'LL TAKE IT. 
TWO QUESTIONS. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM IF THE 
PRESIDENT HAS ACCEPTED [ 
INDISCERNABLE ] 
>> I KNOW THAT THE INVITATION 
HAS BEEN EXTENDED, BUT I DON'T 
BELIEVE A FINAL DECISION HAS 
BEEN MADE. 
I DO KNOW THAT BOTH SECRETARY 
MATTIS AND SECRETARY POMPEO 
úWI 
BELIEVE IT'S NEXT MONTH AND 
WILL BEGIN THE DIALOGUE AND THE 
PROCESS AND POTENTIAL 
DISCUSSION FOR A PRESIDENTIAL 
VISIT LATER IN THE YEAR. 
>>REPORTER:  PAKISTAN CONCERNED 
HISTORIC ELECTION [ 
INDISCERNABLE ]
>> THE UNITED STATES -- 
>>REPORTER:  BRITISH COLUMBIA 
INAUDIBLE  ] 
>> CERTAINLY THE UNITED STATES 
AND INDIA HAVE A DEEP AND 
ABIDING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP 
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
BUILD ON THAT PARTNERSHIP AND 
ADVANCED COOPERATION AND I 
THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT AT THE 
MEETING THAT WILL TAKE PLACE 
WITH SECRETARY POM -- 
SECRETARIES POMPEO AND MATTIS 
NEXT MONTH. 
>> DOES PAUL MANAFORT BELIEVE 
HE IS INNOCENT OF THE CHARGES 
HE FACES? 
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE 
PRESIDENT'S ROLE TO PLAY. 
HE BELIEVES HE'S BEING TREATED 
UNFAIRLY. 
>> HAS THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT 
DIRECTLY TO JEFF SESSIONS AT 
ANY POINT. 
>> WE GOT TIME FOR ONE LAST 
QUESTION. 
LAST QUESTION. 
>> SO THE PRESIDENT'S -- IT'S 
THE PRESIDENT'S OPINION THAT 
SESSIONS SHOULD END THE MUELLER 
PROBE, BUT IT'S ALSO HIS 
OPINION THAT THE MUELLER PROBE 
SHOULD PLAY ITSELF OUT? 
>> THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT 
HE'S WATCHED THIS PROCESS 
FRANKLY PLAY OUT. 
HE'D LIKE TO SEE IT COME TO A 
CONCLUSION SINCE IT'S BEEN 
GOING ON FOR THE BETTER PART OF 
A YEAR AND A HALF. 
AND THEY'VE FOUND NO COLLUSION 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AS HE 
SAID MANY, MANY TIMES BEFORE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS GOT AN EVENT 
STARTING HERE IN A COUPLE 
MINUTES. 
SURE. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU'VE ALSO SAID 
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE CAN 
FIRE MUELLER. 
SO DOESN'T IT LOOK WEAK ON 
TWITTER FOR HIM TO SAY SESSIONS 
SHOULD END THIS PROBE WHEN IT'S 
ROSENSTEIN THAT COULD END THE 
PROBE AND THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVES HE CAN END THE PROBE? 
>> IT'S NOT WEAK FOR THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
TO STATE HIS OPININ. 
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 
>> CATCH PHRASE OF THE DAY AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE, IT'S NOT AN 
ORDER, IT'S HIS OPINION. 
A LOT OF QUESTIONS THERE BEING 
ASKED TO SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET 
EARLIER TODAY CALLING FOR AN 
END TO THE MUELLER PROBE WHICH 
IS STILL ONGOING. 
AND ALSO ASKING ABOUT WHETHER 
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT HIS 
FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER PAUL 
MANAFORT IS INNOCENT. 
HE SAYS THAT HE BELIEVES SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID THAT SHE 
BELIEVES IT'S NOT HIS ROLE TO 
WEIGH IN ON THAT BUT THAT HE 
BELIEVES HE IS BEING TREATED 
UNFAIRLY. 
WE'RE ALSO WATCHING TARIFFS, 
NEW POTENTIAL TARIFFS BEING 
PLACED OR MENTIONED ON CHINA, 
GOING FROM POTENTIALLY 10% TO 
25%. 
WE'RE WATCHING THAT AS WELL, 
AND ALSO LOOKING AT FOR TAT, 
WHO EXACTLY WOULD WIN IN A 
TRADE WAR BETWEEN CHINA AND THE 
U.S. BUT THE BIG FOCUS HAS BEEN 
ON THIS MUELLER PROBE AND THE 
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
ASKED IN FACT TWEETING TODAY 
FOR THE MUELLER PROBE TO COME 
TO AN END AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT 
WOULD ENTAIL AND WHETHER HE 
WOULD USE HIS INFLUENCE, WE ARE 
HEARING FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES 
THAT FOLKS CLOSE TO THE 
PRESIDENT ARE SAYING THAT IS 
HIS OPINION AND THAT HE'S NOT 
GOING TO IN FACT PUSH FORWARD 
ON THAT AND MAKE THAT IN FACT 
AN ORDER. 
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE EXACTLY 
HOW THIS ALL PLAYS DOWN. 
WE'VE GOT OUR MAJOR GARRETT 
STANDING BY. 
WE ARE ALSO SEEING, WATCHING 
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE 
AN EVENT SHORTLY WITH SOME 
LEADERS AS WELL IN ABOUT 15, 20 
MINUTES. 
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT AS 
SOON AS WE GET THAT OUT FOR 
YOU. 
AND EXACTLY WHERE THIS GOES IS 
SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING WITH 
THE MUELLER PROBE. 
THERE WERE SOME FALSE CLAIMS 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING 
THIS ENTIRE INVESTIGATION IS 
BASED ON A STEELE DOSSIER WHICH 
IS ACTUALLY INCORRECT. 
WE'RE GOING TO FACT CHECK SOME 
OF THIS. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MAJOR 
GARRETT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THIS BREAK.
