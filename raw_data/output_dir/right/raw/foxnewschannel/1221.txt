1
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,678
>>  ALL RIGHT, WE'RE TEN DAYS

2
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:10,846
AWAY FROM THE BIG SUMMIT.

3
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:12,814
A LOT OF PEOPLE WORING A LOT OF

4
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:14,149
ANGLES TO MAKE SURE IT GOES WELL

5
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,217
WITHOUT A HITCH.

6
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:17,085
WE WERE TELLING YOU ABOUT HOTEL

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,621
COSTS AND ALL OF THAT STUFF.

8
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,957
RIGHT NOW THE DEPUTY

9
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:23,692
SPOKESPERSON, ADAM, THE

10
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:25,694
IMPORTANCE OF THIS MEETING, I

11
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,696
UNDERSTAND, BUT WHAT STOOD OUT

12
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,998
TO ME, GETTING READY FOR IT, WAS

13
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:31,132
WHO WASN'T IN THE OVAL OFFICE

14
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,667
YESTERDAY WITH THE PRESIDENT AND

15
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:33,768
NUMBER TWO NORTH KOREAN

16
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,437
OFFICIALS AND THAT WOULD BE JOHN

17
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:36,638
BOLTON AND OF COURSE, THE

18
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:37,138
VICE-PRESIDENT.

19
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,107
WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE?

20
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:41,643
>> WELL, A VERY ASTUTE

21
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:43,345
OBSERVATION, MR. CAVUTO.

22
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:46,448
AND I THINK THE CASE -- THE

23
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:47,749
REASON THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE

24
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:50,452
THOSE TWO, THOSE TWO GUYS, PENCE

25
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:52,854
AND BOLTON ARE THE SKUNKS IN THE

26
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:54,022
ROOM AS FAR AS THE NORTH KOREANS

27
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:55,790
ARE CONCERNED.

28
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,758
THEY'VE COMPARED THESE

29
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,059
NEGOTIATIONS OR THE DEAL THEY

30
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,063
WERE THINKING ABOUT TO THE LIBYA

31
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,331
DEAL WHICH WAS BASICALLY IN

32
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,435
2003, GADHAFI IS GIVING UP HIS

33
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,169
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, BUT

34
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,838
REMEMBER, TEN YEARS LATER WE

35
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:11,406
BOMBED GADHAFI TO DEATH.

36
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,507
SO THAT'S WHAT THE KOREANS

37
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:13,241
REMEMBER.

38
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,743
SO, I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT

39
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:16,311
AND HIS TEAM SAID, LOOK, WE

40
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:17,846
DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DERAIL

41
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:18,179
THIS.

42
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,781
WE DON'T WANT TO CAUSE OFFENSE

43
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,917
SO LET'S JUST KEEP JOHN AND THE

44
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,251
VICE-PRESIDENT OUT OF THE ROOM,

45
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,887
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN--

46
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:27,856
BY NO MEANS DOES IT MEAN THAT

47
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,124
THEY'RE OUT OF THE POLICY

48
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:30,225
DELIBERATIONS AND THEY ARE VERY,

49
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:35,230
VERY FIRMLY, I THINK, BEHIND THE

50
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,665
PROCESS THAT'S DRIVING THESE

51
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:37,098
NEGOTIATIONS.

52
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,099
NEIL: WE SHOULD EXPLAIN, OF

53
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,268
COURSE, WHEN WE WERE BOMBING

54
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,938
GADHAFI, HE WENT INTO HIDING AND

55
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,407
THEN, YOU KNOW, FOUND IN A

56
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:47,075
SEWER, A SEWER PIPE AND HIS

57
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:48,610
PEOPLE DRAGGED HIM OUT AND

58
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,010
KILLED HIM.

59
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,812
>> HIS PEOPLE KILLED HIM AND NOT

60
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:51,079
US.

61
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,347
NEIL: AND KIM JONG-UN SAID, I

62
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,315
DON'T WANT THAT.

63
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,283
WHAT HAVE WE ASSURED HIM, DO YOU

64
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:55,584
THINK?

65
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:56,818
>> WELL, I THINK THAT TRUMP HAS

66
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,587
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT

67
00:01:58,587 --> 00:02:00,021
ABOUT REGIME CHANGE.

68
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,990
I THINK THE CHINESE BEHIND THE

69
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,825
SCENES HAVE TOLD KIM THAT

70
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:06,227
THEY'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT HE

71
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,229
STAYS IN POWER, AND THAT HE'S

72
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,497
NOT RISKING HIS REGIME BY

73
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,800
ENTERING INTO THESE

74
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,233
NEGOTIATIONS.

75
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,970
BUT LOOK, LET'S REMEMBER, I

76
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,839
MEAN, THE UNITED STATES AND

77
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,008
NORTH KOREA ARE ABOUT AS FAR

78
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:21,142
APART AS ANY TWO NEGOTIATING

79
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,611
PARTIES CAN BE.

80
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,346
THE UNITED STATES WANTS

81
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,548
COMPREHENSIVE VERIFIABLE,

82
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:28,316
IRREVERSIBLE DISARMAMENT QUICKLY

83
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,151
BEFORE WE GIVE THEM ANY

84
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,187
INCENTIVES OR REWARDS.

85
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:35,624
AND NORTH KOREA WANTS INCENTIVES

86
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:38,860
AND REWARDS AS A PRELUDE TO

87
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,395
TALKING ABOUT THE

88
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:40,929
DENUCLEARIZATION.

89
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,964
SO, ALL THE THEATER ASIDE, YOU

90
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,666
KNOW, THE LETTER, AND THE

91
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,434
DINNERS IN NEW YORK, AND ALL OF

92
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:49,471
THAT SORT OF STUFF, THAT'S THE

93
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:49,838
THEATER.

94
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,573
BUT BEHIND THE THEATER THERE ARE

95
00:02:51,573 --> 00:03:04,819
SOME HUGE  CHASMS, AND DO WE

96
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,555
HAVE THE FOCUS TO SEE IT

97
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:07,889
THROUGH.

98
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,875
NEIL: QUICK

99
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,192
NEIL: QUIC

100
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:11,226
NEIL: DOIC

101
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:11,359
NEIL: DO C

102
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:11,393
NEIL: DO WE

103
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:11,626
NEIL: DO WE?

104
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,161
>> ONE OTHER THING, YOU DIDN'T

105
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,929
TALK ABOUT AIR BNB.

106
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,765
NEIL: HOW IDIOTICIC OF ME.

107
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,199
>> ENTREPRENEURIAL, CHEAP,

108
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,701
YOU'VE GOT A HUGE SELECTION, YOU

109
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,404
CAN CHOOSE YOUR LOCATION AND YOU

110
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,406
NEIL: DON'T YOU THINK THOUGH, IF

111
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,407
YOU'RE CALLING ANY OF THESE

112
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:27,108
HOTELS AND YOU'RE THE NORTH

113
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,777
KOREAN DELEGATION AND

114
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:32,080
EXPLAINING, HI, WE'RE WITH THE

115
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,448
NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION GOING TO

116
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,017
THE PEACE SUMMIT THEY'RE JACKING

117
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,987
IT UP AND WOULD DO THE SAME IN

118
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,555
AIR BNB.

119
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,357
>> I WOULD DO IT DIFFERENTLY, IF

120
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:45,260
I'M A HOTEL AND WANT THE NORTH

121
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,767
KOREANS COMING, THEY'RE UNREE

122
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,301
KOREANS COMING, THEY'RE UNRE

123
00:03:53,301 --> 00:00:00,000
UNPREDICTABLE, ARE THEY GOING TO
