I think in the summer we experience life differently and we approach life differently and I think probably is a few different elements that go into that and sometimes if we're smart we can actually bridge that into our long-term relationships I think in the summer we have time to slow down time to breathe time to sit out in the Sun sit on that little chair with our like ice-t just kind of allowing ourselves to let somebody else in I think of the summer we tend to be much more playful like I think that because the days are longer and because we go outside we are willing to sort of try be playful and I think that might translate into our sex life as well this idea that oh let's see we never had sex under the boardwalk maybe we should try that this time or yeah I don't care that our yard has you know 70 apartment buildings around it and we can see and maybe we can kind of sneak off into a corner I think there is a plate the last element that really does translate into your to your sex life in addition to sort of having time and space for people and just being playful I think the nakedness piece summer is incredibly effective in terms of us creating relationships i think you know you take off that code and you take off the long pants and you're also you're wearing like a bathing suit or a t-shirt and you have the sense of your body and your skin and it's not just in terms of other people i think we do notice other people's bodies and skins but i think we also start understanding our cells look like we are much more conscious of our own bodies and our own breathing in our own how nice that Sun feels on your back or your thigh or how how amazing to have that person put their hand on your shoulder and feel what that feels like the skin on skin contact and so I think having less clothes in general I think being a nudist would be great for everybody but I think general having less clothes really does make you kind of more aware of your body and the embody the person next to you and I think that's incredibly powerful in terms of both your sex life your romance but an intimacy there and a sort of aliveness that you don't get necessarily when you're wearing four layers of clothing and a parka
