(multiple clicks)

2
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:12,070
- When we think about power,
we often think about it

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,660
in terms of traditional,
twentieth century indices,

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,300
like for example, gross national product

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,190
or capacity for technological innovation.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,390
Russia's definitely not a great power

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,453
by either of those measures.

8
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:32,840
away from those more objective things

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,300
to more subjective things like feelings,

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,660
like fear, like anxiety.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,440
When we turn our own attention
away from the real world,

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,650
the three-dimensional world,
and we pay more attention

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,480
to the internet and to what
feels good or bad to us,

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,150
in effect, we're making
life easier for Russia.

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,230
What they can mobilize very
efficiently, very economically

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,000
actually, are psychological
resources over cyber.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,323
They choose that because
it's easy for them.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,250
They have a plan for the world.

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,240
They have a plan for Europe.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,950
They have a plan for us.

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,570
But, it's not about imposing
some kind of positive vision.

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,880
It's about bringing us
back to where they are.

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,750
What President Putin does is
he replaces domestic policy

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,930
of which you can't have
any, with foreign policy.

25
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,210
He can't have domestic policy
because he's an oligarch

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,870
at the head of an oligarchical clan,

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,730
and he's running a country which
can't have the rule of law.

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,550
Hence, Russia is locked into place

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,280
for the foreseeable future where it is.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,180
But, if he can convince
Europeans and Americans

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,780
that oligarchy is normal,

32
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,340
that the rule of law is a joke,

33
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,540
that democracy is fake,
and so on, he can bring us

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,990
to where Russia is.

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,240
And if he can do that,
then Russians will look

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,877
around the world and say,
"It's all just a joke.

37
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,667
"Everything's corrupt, everywhere.

38
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:57,057
"So, why don't we just
prefer our own corruption

39
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:58,810
"to other people's corruption?"

40
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,620
So, this is a strategy.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,210
And, it's at work; it's
what we're up against, now.

42
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,630
There's a very important
difference, I think,

43
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,300
between a nationalism,
which always turns you back

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,997
on yourself, and a patriotism, which says,

45
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,790
"I wanna hold my country up to
a certain set of standards."

46
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,717
Nationalism will generally say,

47
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:18,257
"We have always been innocent.

48
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:19,840
"We are always the innocent victims."

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,490
So, for example, if you're Russia

50
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,490
and you're the biggest
country in the world,

51
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,410
nevertheless, you've somehow
always been on the defensive.

52
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,970
If you attack Ukraine,
nevertheless, this is somehow

53
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,270
a defensive rather than
an offensive operation.

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,410
Nationalism will say it's
always somebody else's fault.

55
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,690
The way it works politically is

56
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,030
that you do things like this.

57
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,350
You attack Ukraine.

58
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,370
You support the far right in Europe.

59
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,790
You support a presidential
candidate in the United States.

60
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,810
Eventually, there's gonna
be some kind of reaction.

61
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,780
That reaction comes.

62
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,577
Then, you say to your
people, "Well yes, look,

63
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,427
"this just proves that we were the victim.

64
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,562
"We were always the victim."

65
00:02:53,562 --> 00:00:00,000
