1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,209
>> MILLENNIAL WOMEN ARE
LEAVING THE GOP IN DROVES.

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:22,900
LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE STATS.

3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,230
THE AMOUNT OF MILLENNIAL MEN HAS

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:45,680
GONE FROM 52 TO 49%, THE OTHER
WAY.

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,571
>> FIRST LET ME NOTE THE BAD
NEWS, THE FACT THAT MILLENNIAL

6
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:55,620
MEN HAVE SLIPPED A LITTLE BIT IS
DISCONCERTING.

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,080
IT IS STILL A NICE SIZE
ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS.

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,790
49 TO 41 AT THIS POINT.

9
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,670
USED TO BE A LITTLE BIT LARGER
THAN THAT.

10
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,400
BUT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS
THE SIZE OF THE LEAD AMONG

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,230
WOMEN BECAUSE IT IS SO LARGE.

12
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,480
USED TO BE BACK IN 2002, 54 TO
36.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,840
THAT IS ALMOST 20 POINTS.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,390
BUT IF YOU CAN HOLD MEN IN ALL
AGE GROUPS YOU CAN STILL SURVIVE

15
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:48,979
AS THEY JUST DID IN 2016.

16
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,280
NOW THAT THESE TRENDS ARE
AMPLIFIED AND CONTINUED TO

17
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,040
MULTIPLY OVER TIME, THEY ARE IN
FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,370
NOW MILLENNIAL WOMEN ARE 70 TO
23.

19
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,240
>>THAT IS CRAZY.

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:15,290
>> YOU CAN OVERCOME THAT LEAD
AMONG 50% OF THE POPULATION.

21
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,069
MILLENNIAL WOMEN ARE NOT THE
MAJORITY WOMEN AT THIS

22
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,880
POINT BUT THEY ARE COMING.

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,590
THAT ARMY OF DEMOCRATIC WOMEN
ARE COMING IN A BIG WAY.

24
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:33,170
THAT DOESN'T MEAN DEMOCRATS
SHOULD BE COMPLACENT.

25
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,930
YOU HAVE TO EARN THEIR TRUST AND
CONTINUE EARNING THEIR TRUST.

26
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,830
THEY ARE MAINLY REBELLING
AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN

27
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,269
PARTY BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE THE
GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO ROOT FOR.

28
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:49,709
>> THERE WAS AN OP-ED RECENTLY
THAT POINTED OUT ANOTHER LITTLE

29
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,200
ASPECT OF THIS TO CLOSE THE
CIRCLE WHICH WAS WOMEN WHO

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,550
IDENTIFY AS DEMOCRATS WERE
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO

31
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,610
SAY THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
TO ACTUALLY GO AND VOTE AND 2018

32
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,890
THAN THEIR PEERS WHO SAY THEY
ARE INDEPENDENT OR REPUBLICAN.

33
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,110
IT IS A GROWING NUMBER OF
PEOPLE, OF WOMEN WHO SAY THEY

34
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,050
ARE DEMOCRAT AND ARE EXTREMELY
LIKELY TO ACTUALLY PUT THAT

35
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,980
NEW IDEOLOGICAL AFFILIATION INTO
PRACTICE AT THE POLLS.

36
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,070
>>IT MAKES SENSE.

37
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,750
IF YOU'RE A YOUNG WOMAN WHY
WOULD YOU BE FOR A REPUBLICAN

38
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,370
PARTY THAT HAS POLICY POSITIONS
THAT LOOK TO DEFUND PLANNED

39
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,210
PARENTHOOD, THEY FIGHT AGAINST
EQUAL PAY, THEY TAKE AWAY THEIR

40
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,040
RIGHT TO CONTROL YOUR OWN BODY
LET ALONE OTHER ISSUES LIKE

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:43,300
BEING AGAINST LGBT RIGHTS WHICH
FOR MILLENNIALS SOUNDS INSANE.

42
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,980
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.

43
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,440
EVERY YEAR THAT MILLENNIALS
BECOME VOTING AGE IS ANOTHER

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,560
YEAR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FADES
INTO THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY.

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,269
RIGHT NOW AS THEY CONTROL ALL
THE LEVELS, YOU CAN SAY YOU

46
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,090
GUYS THAT CAN'T BE THE CASE BUT
THE REALITY IS THEY ARE ON

47
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,940
THEIR LAST LEGS AND YOU WILL SEE
THEM IN ELECTIONS TO COME.

48
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,430
WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
MOTIVATED TO GO VOTE IT IS

49
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,880
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

50
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,459
>>SO WHY ARE MEN GOING UP IN
TERMS OF REPUBLICAN AFFILIATION.

51
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:19,168
>>LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE
POST GAME.

52
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:20,679
TYTNETWORK.COM/JOIN.

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:31,029
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TREND
AND I WANT TO DISCUSS 

54
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:32,029
IT

55
00:04:32,029 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR THE MEMBERS.
