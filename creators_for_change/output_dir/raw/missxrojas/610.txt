11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,579
it wasn't kind of the immense film that

12
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,280
they expected it to be well not for me

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,140

00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,280
cheese because it should have been I

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">disagree well there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was no like taunting</font>

57
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,770
or teasing and none of the wizard being

58
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,840
used as a shield or anything oh my god

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">depth or such kind of just more the</font>

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,740
scale of it like the fact that these

61
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,810
people could take apart buildings like

62
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,540
throw them at each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other oh wow and was</font>

63
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,400
the way they thought like so quickly as

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,390
well as it was everything was it wasn't

65
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,480
the perfect story line but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,400
perfect characters which to me it's so

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,180
much more important like I think problem

68
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,650
with some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early films is that</font>

69
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,270
they kept all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story line and it kind</font>

70
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,209
of in wanting to be loyal<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fans he</font>

71
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,220
sacrificed something was the characters

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,988
journey this film yeah and like even

86
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,480

Fred and George's bit was brilliant

94
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,470

95
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,810
