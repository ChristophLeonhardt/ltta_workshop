at least 11 people have been taken ill after opening a suspicious letter at the Fort Myer military base in Arlington the building where the letter was opened has been evacuated and a crew specializing in hazardous materials is at the scene well let's now cross live to artis Kaleb Morton for more on this hi there Caleb can you tell us any more about what's happened well joint Myer base Henderson Hall that's a military installation near the city of Arlington Virginia very close to Washington DC and apparently a package containing a hazardous material now we don't know what hazardous material it is but a hazardous material was delivered on the scene it was delivered this package and now 11 people are ill because of what was in this package this substance now I understand the Arlington Fire Department is on the scene and people in hazmat suits are also on the scene from what we understand now at this point three patients have been transported to the to the hospital in they're in stable condition five people displaying symptoms and at this point it's not clear what the substance is we don't know what it is but it's making people ill now this is coming on the on the back of a wave of fake attacks uh there was a wave of suspicious packages containing white powder that were delivered one was delivered to the Trump family one was delivered to the British house of parliament another was delivered to julian assange but all three of those the the substance the white powder in the package was not dangerous it wasn't a dangerous substance however this one that was delivered to this military base does appear to actually be a dangerous substance people are actually ill and actually harmed because of the substance in this envelope we don't know what it is but at this point the roads leading to this military installation have actually been blocked off the area is essentially under lockdown the fire department is on the scene people in hazmat suits are on the scene people are trying to determine what the substance is that was in this this this envelope I'm sure they're trying to get to the bottom of who sent it but this is definitely a security concern people are thinking of the anthrax attacks that that swept the United States almost a oh well over a decade ago a lot of fear is on people's minds as they're trying to figure out what exactly is going on here why is this envelope containing a suspicious substance that is now making people ill why was this delivered and what's going on here plenty of questions that Caleb Maupin thank you very much indeed few thoughts thank you
