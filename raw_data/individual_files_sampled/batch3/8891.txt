HOW BAD IS MICHAEL AVENATTI HIS LAWYERS ARE BAD. A CALIFORNIA JUDGE DISMISSED STORMY DANIEL'S DEFAMATION SUIT AND ORDERED HER TO PLAY TRUMP'S LEGAL FEES. NOW WHEN JUDGES DO THAT IT'S TO SEND A MESSAGE. YOUR LAWYER'S A MORON. POOR STORMY, AS A RULE PEOPLE PAY HER FOR SEX AND NOW AVENATTI REVERSED IT. HE CHASED SPOT LIGHTS AN WHEN HE CATCHES THEM HE LOOKS RIDICULOUS. HE'S GOOD AT COSTING HIS OWN SIDE MONEY. HIS FIRM WAS ORDER TO PAY $10 MILLION TO AN ATTORNEY WHO ONCE WORKED THERE AND WHAT ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH DEBACLE AND MANY FLED SENSING THEY WERE BECOMING HIS VICTIMS TOO. WHY COMPLAIN. SHE'S BAIN DISASTER FOR THE DEMOCRATS. ARE WE SURE HE WASN'T ON TRUMP'S PAYROLL ALL ALONG. NOW HE'S TAKEN TO CHALLENGING PEOPLE TO FIGHT ON TWITTER LIKE A TOWN- A TOW POLUCA. HOW DOES THE TRICKSTER GET AWAY WITH IT? DOES THE STATE BAR CARE ABOUT ETHICS. ISN'T THERE A DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE OR IS HE EXEMPT BECAUSE HE'S A LIBERAL ATTACK DOG. HIS PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE HARSH. MAKE HIM REPRESENT HIMSELF. HE'S GOING TO RUN, DANA. HE IS RUNNING. MAYBE THIS COULD BE GREET FOR HIM. MAYBE HE DOESN'T CARE. HE DOES PROVIDE A LOT OF FODDER. I'M SURE THE DEMOCRATS WISH HE WOULD JUST GO AWAY OR BECOME A REPUBLICAN. HE COULD RUN WITH LIZ. WHAT A TICKET. THEY CAN COME UP WITH OTHER IDEA. I DO WONDER IF AVENATTI WILL HELP STORMY DANIELS PAY THE LEGAL FEES. HER GO FUND ME PAGE WHICH IS FLOODED WITH MONEY WITH PEOPLE WHO HATE TRUMP WILL GO TO TRUMP. TRUMP ALWAYS MAKES MONEY. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE HITCHED THEIR RIDE TO THE WRONG HORSE. HE'S TAKEN THE DEMOCRATS FOR A RIDE AND IT WON'T BE A VICTORY LAP. THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY SAID SHE'S A HORSEFACE OR WHATEVER ON TWITTER AND NOW ANYBODY ON THE LEFT IS UPSET. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT BUT HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY, THE LEFT HAS USED THE WORD "C" WORD TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE IN THE TRUMP FAMILY AND EVERYBODY APPLAUDED THAT. THEY FANTASIZED ABOUT KILLING THE PRESIDENT AND NOW THEY'RE CLUTCHING THEIR PEARLS WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE WORD "HORSE FACE"? PLEASE, YOU'RE SURPRISED DONALD TRUMP SAYS THING ABOUT PEOPLE, EITHER YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING OR YOUR DENSE. THIS IS WHAT HE DOES AND HOW HE WINS. NOW REGARDING THE OTHER CLAIM ABOUT THE GANG RAPE CASE, THAT BEING SO FALSE IN AND OF ITSELF MAKES ME THINK MAYBE DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH STORMY DANIELS. I WOULD SAY THAT STORMY DANIELS HAVE ALSO SAID NOT SO NICE THING ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXPERIENCE. THERE'S THINGS WE WILL NOT REPEAT. AVENATTI 2020 WILL BE LIT AS THE KIDS SAY AND I THINK HE'LL BE UPSET HE WAS INVOLVED. THEY THINK THE REASON THEY LOST THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT IS HE GOT INVOLVED AND PUTTING STORMY DANIELS IN A POSITION WHERE HE WON'T PAY THE LEGAL BILLS FOR HER AND WILL FIND SOME OTHER WOMAN TO JUMP INTO THIS TRAP OF POLITICS CLAIMING HE WILL REPRESENT HER AND IT WILL BE GREAT, THEY'RE GOING TO WIN AND YET HIS TRACK RECORD SHOWS THE OPPOSITE. IT'S NOT FOR WOMEN GETTING INVOLVED, WARNING, YOU SEE HIM KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR, TELL HIM TO GO AWAY. WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLICATIONS FOR WHAT HE'S DONE WELL, THE KIDS SAY HIS CAMPAIGN IS LIT? LIT. LIKE ON FIRE. IT'S GOING TO BE EXCITING TO WATCH. I THINK DANA AND GREG HAD IT RIGHT. IT WILL BE FUN FOR US. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. TO ME THE HORSE FACE STUFF, BY THE WAY, COME ON. YOU SAY IT'S TYPICAL TRUMP BUT CARLY FIORINA AND I THINK, MAN, AT SOME POINT AMERICAN WOMEN ARE LIKE THIS GUY'S AND SOMETHING ABOUT IMPORTANT STARS. I SEE. I THINK IT'S ALL WOMAN IN TERMS OF HIS ATTITUDE. I THINK THE REAL INTERESTING THING HERE IS HOW THE RIGHT IS MAKING THIS OUT TO BE SUCH A BIG WIN. TOTAL VINDICATION FOR DONALD TRUMP WHEN THIS ISN'T THE MAIN CASE. THE MAIN CASE HAS TO DO WITH THE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. THIS WAS ABOUT THE UNKNOWN GUY IN THE PARKING LOT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE NON-DISCLOSURE? MY POINT TO YOU IS THIS CASE IS NOT SETTLED. HERE'S THE ISSUE, THIS WAS THE CASE THEY JUST WON WAS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST ONE BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE HUSH AGREEMENT SHE TOOK THE MONEY. IT WILL BE HARD FOR HER TO BE PROVEN TO BE RIGHT IF SHE'D TAKEN THE MONEY. SHE SAID IN FACT IT WASN'T PROPERLY SIGNED AND MICHAEL COHEN WHO NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE STANDS THIS IS WHERE THE CONVERSATION NOT ONLY HERE BUT IN AMERICA HAS GONE. MICHAEL AVENATTI HAD A RELATIONSHIP?
