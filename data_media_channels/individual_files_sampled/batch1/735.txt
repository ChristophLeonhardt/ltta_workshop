on the 22nd of May a series of major news stories broke across West Africa in a simultaneous publication now known as the West Africa leaks journalists from 11 countries had poured over gigabytes of data nearly 30 million leaked documents on tax havens and the secretive offshore companies of the rich and powerful like the Panama papers investigations of 2016 and the Paradise Papers stories last year this collaboration was coordinated by the IC IJ the international consortium of investigative journalists based in the US it worked alongside the Norbert Xango cell for investigative journalism Orson ozo in burkina faso we've reported on the IC IJ's work before and we've been tracking these particular investigations since February when the journalists involved first met to lay the groundwork what sets the West Africa leaks apart from other IC IJ collaborations is the media landscape the conditions in which the journalists work taking on powerful individuals institutions and a global financial system that secretive by design is difficult for any reporter in West Africa that's just the beginning and one of this group of journalists greatest challenges was getting their readers their governments and in some cases even the media outlets they work for to care the listening-posts Nick Muir had now on the making and breaking of the West Africa leaks West Africa leaks is the largest of our collaboration of investigative reporters from across West Africa the vision matters and yet the vision seems to be badly on their report calm apparently doing devastating avec good Confederate different beliefs you D'Souza keep some hope - duelist you to do we we have 13 journalists exploring nearly 30 million offshore financial records you shoulda killed Marishka bahia suppose you see a condo a professional acid oh c'mon why is someone who has nothing no experience no training in mining why is she the director for a mining company this is a man who is championing the cause of the cool and mixed deliberate efforts to deny Ghana legitimate tax from Ghana spoon oil what we've seen with global media collaborations not only is it the more the merrier the more the punchier the west africa leaks got its start in Dakar Senegal we're gonna find a much more interesting name for this project over the next two days in a two-day workshop organised by the IC IJ and soon ozone journalists were given access to a compilation of data from six major leaks held by the IC IJ the purpose of the workshop was not only to introduce the journalists to the data but also to help them start reading between the lines you don't go offshore and write in an email that you want to evade taxes lawyers and potential crooks are a lot more sophisticated than that and therefore understanding how to read the signs and how to interpret the red flags in offshore documents is crucial one was a pH my wallet contacts it he owns a plate you see them oakley all you do free even single only took him more sample professes unit release them more in doing stories of this nature it's very important to take note the right terminology to use it's not for you the journalists to say somebody has

can easily go find the person actually data alone doesn't tell a story you need to investigate what the data presents to you starts the have a part of the world but fortunately I did find some documents and I started building hypotheses and the document started answering the questions we're coming to the end of the first editorial meeting held here in Dhaka the journalists behind me have been given access to 6r c rj projects or relating to the murky world of offshore finance primed for the investigation it's time to head home and begin digging through the data and hopefully to start connecting the dots the west africa leaks is the i CI J's seventh major media collaboration investigating offshore finance there can of course be legal legitimate reasons for an individual or company to keep assets offshore over the past few years however the consortium has broken multiple stories documenting serious abuse of the system there are good reasons why the ICJ chose to focus on West Africa for its latest investigative collaboration first the economics according to the UN more than 16 billion dollars a year is moved offshore from West Africa illegally which amounts to more than the GDP of six of its poorest countries combined second governance authorities here either lack the ability or the will to stop money from being stashed offshore where it can't be taxed and as the investigations reveal politicians are often the worst culprits then you have the media news organizations that aren't state-run not typically owned by those in power or those close to them so coverage all too often veers away from holding the elite to account which is why didn't take long for these journalists to start finding some newsworthy stories in leisure the second largest and the second poorest country in West Africa Musa Aska editor of the lemon mall newspaper is investigating a government funded project worth around 30 million dollars in 2009 a contract to build a modern refrigerated slaughterhouse was awarded to an obscure Australian company registered offshore with links to the Nigerian Minister of livestock the higher bar air in the data Oscar found that money was paid to the Australian firm but a large amount of it went missing the new facility was meant to boost new Jers meat industry but when he went to the site of the slaughterhouse nearly a decade on he

news and online publication he is investigating a former Ghanaian ambassador to the United States Kwame barua I do say who on his foundation's website is described as a philanthropist and a humanitarian looking through documents leaked to the IC IJ from the bermuda based law firm Appleby dog Davi discovered that Barua do say used the spider web of offshore companies to hide from Ghana and tax authorities his share of a three hundred and five million dollar oil bill Duchess worried everyone that had diplomas who should know better and conduct himself in the most ethical way registers offshore companies so he would more or less maximize his profit and lessen his tax burdens and contrary to the Vienna Convention that guides the conduct of diplomats on duty he engaged in business activities and more seriously in offshore business while he was still ambassador there is a clear conflict of interest and abuse of office in this matter I've been to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs they haven't responded to my questions and that's very typical of Ghanaian politicians they ignore you when you have very serious and important questions to ask they would not respond if they respond at all they will respond after the facts all right so how did that occur but they simply didn't respond to the queries and I only want a simple questions general responses us to what the ministry would do normally under circumstances of that nature but didn't respond there seems to be a pattern of behaviour here where government institutions or business leaders don't feel the need to respond to journalists why do you think that is I think it's simply impunity I definitely did everything emails phone calls hand-delivered later I give them audio opportunity in the world within or over a month to answer the questions and they haven't I've done my part so we're stuff collects is coming out next Tuesday that's really spending a lot of time at the moment helping our partners get over the line powerful people in that part of the world really don't like to respond to questions so I'm spending lots of time on the phone okay I've been helping West Africa Lakes partners make contact with and get responses from a number of subjects across the Western African region I should say that this really is a two prong approach that is the journalist in country will always try on their own end to make contact with that person about whom they're writing a story but as we've found in a number of cases that local journalist is seen as beneath the standing of an important person or a politician in that country to respond to so what I try and do then is call from a u.s. number and it's surprisingly effective yes good afternoon is this is this miss Brad Parker hello hello miss Brad Parker my name's Will Fitzgibbon according to the documents we have from Panama papers you were listed as a shareholder of Greater putu Foundation limited a company in the Seychelles Lucius Davis works for the news newspaper he's been on the trail of Kevin the bride Parker a close friend of the former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in the Panama papers were records showing that bright Parker a pharmacist by trade was appointed director of a shell company called greater purity Foundation limited through this company right Parker Lobby the Johnson Sirleaf government on behalf of a foreign mining business to land a lucrative and controversial deal for them despite a clear paper trail linking by Parker to greater Puget Foundation limited both she and Johnson Sirleaf have denied any knowledge of the company which should pique any editors interest but not necessarily in Liberia we will few hours to go to the publication of the story have not gotten the confirmation from an editor that the story we will be publishing the news newspaper my editor has not correctly explained to me why he cannot publish the story but from our reading it's because of the people who are involved in this story the news like many newspapers in West Africa is owned by a politician in this case Wilson Cato pay the country's Minister of Commerce the paper is widely seen as taking an editorial a soft approach to the current government and by the look of things to the friends of former governments as well we drop delicious off at the news newspaper about five hours ago now we're just waiting on his call to find out whether or not his editors going to publish the story his editor goes through the story then great if not and there is a plan B in the works moments later David confirms that his editor has rejected the story so we head across town to meeting rush hour traffic means that we reach our destination after nightfall the offices of the daily observer to ensure that he gets published david has and not for the first time he says taken his story to the competition a last-minute editorial meeting is called and the story gets the green light it moves through layout and into print within 12 hours a four month investigation billed for one newspaper lines up in the front page of another the news leads with the far less antagonistic story about calls for war club you know we asked the papers editor-in-chief for an interview he agrees to speak with us however when we arrive at the news room he has left the building and won't take our course Tuesday May 22nd and across West Africa the investigations have started to go public in Togo Maxime damini's story about the dealings of businessman patrice yahoo Kennecott or is on the front page of loud tentative it gets picked up by Togolese radio however supporters of the government presumably circulate on social media a fake front page of lau genitive calling the papers editor-in-chief a thief in nature Musa a scars investigation into what he calls the phantom slaughterhouse makes national news in Liberia The Daily Observer leads with ferocious David's story until a vendor by Parker however literacy rates in the country alone radio is where most librarians get their news and for the story to hit home it'll need to transition from print to broadcast in the days after publication this investigation it seems has failed to do that it is the bank that helped clients break the law now hsbc secrets are out the political impact of past media collaborations coordinated by the IC RJ was almost immediately the bank shot their money from the public and often simply from tax authorities including those in Germany the Panama papers investigation of 2016 made headlines across the globe mr. prime minister what can you tell me about a company called VIN please so now I'm starting to feel a bit strange about these questions because it's like you are accusing me of something in Iceland the Prime Minister was confronted on air about his offshore dealings he resigned a few days later the founders of the law firm mossack fonseca were arrested amongst others money has been reclaimed and there was a healthy dose of public outrage in many countries this forest of documents basically has been dubbed the paradise papers last year's paradise papers had less impact fewer headlines near saturation but even by those standards the reaction to the west-african leaks has seen muted why is hard to pinpoint it could be the geographical focus of the stories the stubborn silence of many of those investigated or even the lack of evidence public anger my question after West Africa Lakes is where is all that outrage where are those public demonstrations what we do know is that it's not because the communities in the countries and the citizens don't care about these stories all you have to do is speak to the reporters go on Facebook to see that every single story from West Africa leaks was followed very closely and had really great local Bayan case in point Burkina Faso where journalists andreen saw a dagger of laconia miss defesa reported on two leading businessman and a possible case of tax evasion on a prisoner stop do Zulu steady competitive on city suppose don't turn upon the Avanti police do Lecter this is your not luck swap reports per se prisoner University your proposal mr. journalist Lhasa significant Nevada la de la broche intellection de Nations and Russia a horse interest and police are to ski fluency elicits to Kirin Bonjour in Ghana nearly a month after Emmanuel Dogberry published his story the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finally got back to him about his questions with questions of its own they were to ask me to tell them specific cases I was investigating there was no need to tell them what or who I was investigating I just wanted to know clearly what the general rules were for the conduct of diplomas for duty for me issues at the religion of Duty they shows a lack of understanding of the role of journalists and they are running away from being held accountable the Ministry disagrees with dr. V in a statement test it said that you to his quote failure to disclose vital information it was unable to put the matter into context and therefore could not provide any additional information that governments share have been slow to respond to the revelations in the West Africa leaks or have ignored them completely as come as no surprise what's been more concerning has been the lack of response from other news outlets in the region one would expect stories of high-level corruption and financial irregularities to top the news agenda however the subjects of these investigations are the very people who in large part control what gets reported in West Africa and what does not clearly there's some political pressures there's journalists that are press not to publish certain kind of things and we can understand that we are working in in that environment so we can we can never tell which of all the variables have more effect on on the impact or the lack of repopulation I remember one example from Ivory Coast where the day after the publication of a really strong West Africa League story into the undeclared offshore company of a very senior Cote wild politician a newspaper associated with the political party of that politician the next day carried a headline that said something along the lines of troublemaking journalists just out to settle a score so to my mind the fact that we haven't seen a global or even regional outcry from West Africa leagues is not indicative in and of itself of the quality but rather of significant work that remains in terms of Free Press and in terms of investigative journalism what no one can take away from the West Africa leaks is the fact that is historic it's the first time you have this number of journalists within the sub region collaborating and working together on a project which itself asked to the value of the work we do as journalists and we hope that in the long term that collaboration will serve as inspiration for other for other African journalism no concept of flesh you know say elicits and you only would love to do lists see on a table or tenders tomandamanda - deucer for me what partly the circus NOLA the pond objective Corazon would West African society actually I did you manage to momenta so formation latest you he was feverish democracy report a little official Mercedes's dockworker Nancy a little enmity in the same premier tier Coren Apicella disease yeon-seo the prison police you have to journalists what at cos your artistry there's a misconception about journalism one that many reporters still hold that once you expose corruption or wrongdoing the problem then comes to an end but that's not always the case journalism is just one step on the road to accountability and unless civil society gets behind the story the political will to take action will not be there journalists in short cannot do it alone you've been watching a special edition of our program on the West Africa leaks we'll see you next time here at The Listening Post
