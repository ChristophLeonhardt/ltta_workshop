1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,884
I wanted to test out for myself

2
00:00:01,884 --> 00:00:04,342
how waking up at 4:30
affected my productivity.

3
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:08,250
I woke up at 4:30 a.m. for
one week, like a Navy SEAL.

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,097
I've read a lot about how Navy SEALs

5
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:13,075
like Jocko Willink wake
up at 4:30 in the morning.

6
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:16,758
Jocko famously says that
discipline equals freedom.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,570
It is Friday, two days before
I start this experiment.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,950
Normally my alarm goes off
five minutes before 8:00 a.m.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,901
Setting my alarm a full three
and a half hours earlier

10
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,370
is gonna be really scary.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,673
Will I survive?

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,800
I know I'm gonna break
this bed by 8:00 p.m. rule,

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,120
because I already have plans
next week that start at 7:30.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,800
The gym in my building
doesn't open until 6:00,

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,840
so I'm gonna try and kill
an hour and a half outdoors.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,570
I don't drink coffee, so this is probably

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,100
gonna be pretty hard for me.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,540
The bag cam, what are the
eye bags looking like?

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,413
Pre-4:30 a.m. eyes.

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,050
It is Sunday night, it is 9:42 p.m.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,750
I am going to attempt to go to sleep.

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,483
That's just not enough hours.

23
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:33,355
(yawn)

24
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:38,355
Never have I ever cooked
at 5:20 in the morning.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,010
Here we are, 7:30 a.m.

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,983
I have made my lunch for the
entire week, minus Friday,

27
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,013
I have straightened my
hair, and that is it.

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,273
Let's see who's here.

29
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,340
Oh, surprise! Nobody.

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,270
I was a little loopy,
I was a little giddy,

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,490
and then around lunchtime,
I got a little hangry

32
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,639
and I ate my lunch that
I made this morning,

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,780
and that got my energy
back up a little bit,

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,970
and then, like, 1:15, 2:00, I was just.

35
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,375
(whistling)

36
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,483
(crash)

37
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,240
Jacqui: What are you doing tonight after

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,263
getting up at 4:30?

39
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,033
Emma: We're going to the movies!

40
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,950
I don't even know what to say.

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm so tired.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,430
I was pretty productive.

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,910
I did finish a video.

44
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,370
I can see already why this is a good idea

45
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,843
for certain people.

46
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:48,530
I don't know if that certain
people is this people.

47
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,370
If I had to rate my energy
level from zero to 10,

48
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,743
I would say I'm about a four and a half.

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,943
It's Tuesday!

50
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,870
So, today I woke up at
4:30 and I went for a run.

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,500
I hate this so much.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,680
Not a runner.

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,610
Ooh, I see a rat.

54
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,443
Oh, a duck!

55
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,030
Look at all the wildlife!

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,500
I ran for about six minutes.

57
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,333
High five.

58
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,990
That's what I thought.

59
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:24,414
And just like that, folks,

60
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:27,480
I'm a human being before 7:00 a.m.

61
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,460
I would never describe a run
as peaceful before today,

62
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,540
but it was.

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,000
The lighting was lovely.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,870
I think exercising in the morning

65
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,440
helped me stay a little more chipper.

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,290
I felt more confident today.

67
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,750
I would say, on a scale from zero to 10,

68
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,690
I feel about a seven.

69
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,493
Oh, oh, and the bag cam.

70
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,900
How are the bags doing today?

71
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,043
My grandma calls them suitcases.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,830
I turned off the alarm,
and then I sat in bed

73
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,490
on my phone for about a half an hour.

74
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,870
And then, at 5:00, I
was like, alright girl,

75
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,761
it's time, you're gonna do a thing.

76
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:14,785
And guess what I did?

77
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:16,200
I painted my nails!

78
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,640
I also painted my toenails.

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,540
I did a really bad job.

80
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,610
And then I had my phone call

81
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,730
with my friend Dana, who lives in Israel,

82
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,900
who's seven hours ahead of me.

83
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,590
So that was a plus.

84
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,230
I had an interview today

85
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,530
with someone I've been trying to

86
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,210
get in contact with for a while,

87
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,912
and it went really well,
so I was really hype

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,103
for, like, 45 minutes,

89
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:42,161
and then just (boom) crashed.

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,580
I had such a hard time this morning.

91
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,970
I got into work and I couldn't function.

92
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,540
I'm gonna play my kickball game,

93
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,950
and I'm gonna try to go to bed by 8:00.

94
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,250
I know that's not gonna happen,

95
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,040
but I need to actually try.

96
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,080
The bedtime is what's messing me up.

97
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,330
Just got back from kickball.

98
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,323
It's 9:12, I'm going to bed, bye!

99
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:06,715
Hi, it's Thursday, and
I am much more alert!

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,500
I had all this footage
from a trip that I went on

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,470
with my family in November,

102
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,290
and I had never pieced it together

103
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,520
into any sort of cohesive thing,

104
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,830
so that's what I did this morning.

105
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,420
I finished it, finally.

106
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,200
And then I changed and went to the gym,

107
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,900
then I showered and I came to work.

108
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,480
As you can see, my energy levels

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,140
are pretty high today.

110
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,300
I cracked the formula.

111
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,750
If you go to bed at a reasonable hour,

112
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,210
and then you do exercise when you wake up,

113
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,573
bag cam, bag cam.

114
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,213
I'm looking okay today, I think.

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,697
It's Friday.

116
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,030
Made it.

117
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,710
I did wake up and I went for a walk

118
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,520
at the Brooklyn Bridge, which was lovely.

119
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,860
The weather was a perfect 72 degrees,

120
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,810
the light was beautiful,
there weren't too many clouds.

121
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, it was a dream.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,180
Everyone should wake
up and see the sunrise

123
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,100
at the Brooklyn Bridge once
in their life, just once.

124
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,500
I got to call my British mom today,

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,510
because they're five hours ahead,

126
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,120
so I called her at
about 5:30 this morning,

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,420
and that was really nice
to catch up with her.

128
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,870
I was actually incredibly
productive today for two reasons.

129
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,420
One, I figured out the sleep schedule.

130
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,740
Two, it's the end of Q2
and everyone was hustling.

131
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,870
I feel okay.

132
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,920
How do my eyes look?

133
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,573
Check out the bag cam.

134
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,810
I have major respect for Navy SEALs

135
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,410
who wake up at 4:30 in the morning,

136
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,430
anyone who works night
shifts, has wild hours,

137
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,450
kudos, I get it now maybe a little bit,

138
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,390
maybe not to the fullest
extent, but, like, wow.

139
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,400
All in all, at the end of this experiment,

140
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,080
I understand now why
people wake up at 4:30.

141
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,730
You feel really good about yourself

142
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,200
when you're productive before

143
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,840
everyone else you know has
even risen from the pillow.

144
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,160
I don't know if this
4:30 time is gonna stick.

145
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,240
I did like being awake at sunrise,

146
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,357
but sunrise is like 5:30,

147
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:27,357
so maybe I'll push to a
6:00 a.m., 6:30 wake up.

148
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,960
Having a regimented wake up time

149
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,290
was really useful for me.

150
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,800
I could feel a little more rested,

151
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,360
but other than that, I've
achieved a lot of things

152
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,260
I've needed to do for
a long time this week.

153
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,710
I think waking up at 4:30
really opened my eyes.

154
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,090
Now that this week is over,
I'm gonna go take a nap.

155
00:07:48,090 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you guys later.
