<font color="#E5E5E5">the truth wasn't going to come out and</font>

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,220
in 2004<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a documentary</font>

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,040
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mississippi Burning case three</font>

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,270
civil rights workers Schwerner Chaney

11

and Goodman who were<font color="#E5E5E5"> murdered by the</font>

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,860
of preparing to make that film<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to</font>

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,280
do a lot of research<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through one</font>

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the films I saw the image of a body</font>

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,730
being taken out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the river and the</font>

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,830
narrator said something like this was

the wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> body this wasn't the body of</font>

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,340
Schwerner Chaney<font color="#CCCCCC"> or Goodman and</font>

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,800
therefore the searchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved on and</font>

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,470
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like wait a sec I</font>

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,979
stopped he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wound it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whose body</font>

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,630
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this that they found further research</font>

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,880
revealed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was the body of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Henry D</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">African American named Charles anymore</font>

30
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,910
so these two black youths were the wrong

bodies and the other three<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the</font>

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,750
doing a reenactment<font color="#CCCCCC"> which was kind of</font>

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,310
ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we borrowed an old truck</font>

47

which we understood from<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI documents</font>

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,060
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken place with long poles</font>

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,709
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boys were whipped beaten</font>

eventually they were rolled into the

back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a car</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and taken across the</font>

Charles<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marcus Edwards and he had been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interviewed by Connie Chung and he had</font>

78
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,980
we knew where he<font color="#CCCCCC"> lived</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well Charles</font>

79
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,930
Edwards lived in the Bunkley community

80
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,930
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a well-known</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Klan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hotspot</font>

81
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,850
shall we say in the southern<font color="#E5E5E5"> US in fact</font>

82
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,860
it was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home of some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,989
most violent<font color="#E5E5E5"> Klan members in US history</font>

84
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he still lived there so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas and I</font>

85
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,390
decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would first try to call</font>

86
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,690
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or three or four attempts than</font>

87
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,010
each time he hung up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on another occasion</font>

88
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,010
we went to Edwards house and the plan

89
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,079
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Thomas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would come out and I</font>

90
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">would film Thomas trying to talk to</font>

91
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,670
Edwards and we drove up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mr. Edwards</font>

92
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,799
was in his driveway<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got out I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

93
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">camera ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this dog lunged at mean</font>

94
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,299
with barking and I turned around Thomas

95
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas stayed in the van</font>

96
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,640
and I walked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to Edwards in</font>

97
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,260
his driveway and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him to</font>

98
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course he didn't and he</font>

99
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">kicked me off his property and I backed</font>

100
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,899
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we drove off and Thomas</font>

101
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,130
revealed that he was just paralyzed with

102
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,339
fear he<font color="#CCCCCC"> could not get out of the van</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

103
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,870
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> occasion we decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

104
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,729
Edwards was a deacon of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a church in</font>

105
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,070
Bunkley the Bunkley Baptist Church which

106
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a church actually built by the Klan</font>

107
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that maybe being on the</font>

108
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,550
church grounds would somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

109
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,689
allow Edwards to be more honest or<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

110
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,360
be more amenable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talking we knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

111
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">he would arrive early to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open the church</font>

112
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,439
we drove back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth on the Bunkley</font>

113
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">Road several</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dozen times</font>

114
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,579
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edwards arrived at the church we</font>

115
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,989
approached and this time Thomas got out

116
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,779
of the truck<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had a conversation and</font>

117
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,189
Edwards of course denied that he had

118
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,959
anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with killing Charles</font>

119
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">Moore Thomas's brother but when I asked</font>

120
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,099
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> did he have any role in picking them</font>

121
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:00,459
up

122
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,889
he went silent<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wouldn't answer that</font>

123
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,139
question and I asked him several times

124
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,059
did you have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

125
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,399
picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> those boys up sir</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and Edwards</font>

126
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">kept backing up and eventually kicked us</font>

127
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,849
off the property<font color="#CCCCCC"> again on one day we</font>

128
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,189
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go for lunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a place that</font>

133
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,669
to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> my feet up on the dashboard and</font>

134
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thomas saw a guy he knew in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact a</font>
