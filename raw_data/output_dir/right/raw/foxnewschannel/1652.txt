1
00:00:00,496 --> 00:00:01,564
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING

2
00:00:01,564 --> 00:00:01,865
HERE.

3
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:02,298
IT'S AN HONOR.

4
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:03,967
>> THANK YOU.

5
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:07,403
>> MR. PRESIDENT, NORTH KOREA --

6
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,439
>> NOTHING HAS CHANGED ON NORTH

7
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,406
KOREA THAT WE KNOW OF.

8
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:12,175
WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ANYTHING.

9
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:14,077
AND IF IT DOES, THAT'S FINE.

10
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:15,678
IF IT DOESN'T, I THINK WE'LL

11
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:17,213
PROBABLY HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL

12
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:17,547
MEETING.

13
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:21,184
BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD

14
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:21,951
ANYTHING.

15
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:22,952
WE'RE JUST READING STORIES LIKE

16
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:23,553
YOU ARE.

17
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:25,088
WE'VE HEARD CERTAIN THINGS FROM

18
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,055
SOUTH KOREA.

19
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:26,990
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

20
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,125
IF THE MEETING HAPPENS, IT

21
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:29,459
HAPPENS.

22
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,561
AND IT DOESN'T, WE GO ON TO THE

23
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,095
NEXT STEP.

24
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,696
>> JUST TYPICAL THING THAT NORTH

25
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:34,130
KOREA DOES?

26
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,331
DID YOU EXPECT THAT?

27
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:36,900
>> I REALLY DON'T, NO.

28
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,634
I WANT TO GIVE EVERYBODY THE

29
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:40,670
BENEFIT OF A DOUBT.

30
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,871
I THINK THAT I CAN ONLY SAY OUR

31
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:43,006
PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY DEALING

32
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:44,908
WITH THEM RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF

33
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:45,575
MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE

34
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:46,943
MEETING.

35
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:49,345
SO THAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN

36
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:50,413
WHAT YOU READ BUT OFTENTIMES,

37
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:52,181
WHAT YOU READ IF IT'S NOT FAKE

38
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,416
NEWS IS TRUE.

39
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,684
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

40
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:57,253
WE ARE DEALING WITH THEM NOW.

41
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:58,121
WE MAY HAVE THE MEETING.

42
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,155
WE MAY NOT HAVE THE MEETING.

43
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:02,191
IF WE DON'T HAVE IT, THAT WILL

44
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:02,759
BE VERY INTERESTING.

45
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,161
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

46
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:08,231
THE BORDER IS STILL QUITE

47
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:08,564
STRONG.

48
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:09,432
I THINK THINGS CHANGED A LITTLE

49
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:11,834
BIT WHEN THEY MET WITH CHINA.

50
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,569
THEY MET THE SECOND TIME AS YOU

51
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:14,971
KNOW, KIM JONG UN HAD A SECOND

52
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,606
MEETING WITH CHINA WHICH WAS A

53
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:18,508
LITTLE BIT OF A SURPRISED

54
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:18,841
MEETING.

55
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,043
AND WE HAVE MANY OF THE CHINESE

56
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:22,979
HERE TODAY, AS YOU KNOW, BIG

57
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,314
DELEGATIONS NEGOTIATING TRADE

58
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:25,081
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS

59
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,417
BEEN RIPPED OFF FOR MANY, MANY

60
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,685
YEARS BY ITS BAD TRADE DEALS.

61
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:29,619
I DON'T BLAME CHINA.

62
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:31,521
I BLAME OUR LEADERSHIP OF THIS

63
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,555
COUNTRY FROM THE PAST.

64
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:35,625
WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY

65
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:35,925
CHINA.

66
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:37,727
AND AN EVACUATION OF WEALTH LIKE

67
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:40,863
NO COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE

68
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:46,903
GIVEN TO ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT'S

69
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:48,438
THE MONEY THAT THEY'VE TAKEN OUT

70
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:49,005
OF THE UNITED STATES.

71
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,039
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

72
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,373
ANYMORE.

73
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:51,374
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A BIG

74
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,876
DIFFERENCE SINCE THEY HAD THE

75
00:01:53,876 --> 00:00:00,000
SECOND MEETING WITH THE
