Hillary Clinton and after all Hillary Clinton is not some clown on Twitter gluten was the Democrats nominee for president of the United States got more actual people vote to vote for her than Donald Trump did she gave an interview in Mumbai I guess it wasn't India and she was asked once again why should there's one thing that Hillary Clinton is an expert on she I know anything about you know International Affairs she doesn't know anything about governing she does know anything about America but she if you ask her why she lost the election she is an expert listen to this her latest explanation what the map doesn't show you is that I won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product so I won the places that our optimistic diverse dynamic moving forward and his whole campaign make America great again was looking backwards you know you didn't like black people getting rights you don't like women you know getting jobs you don't want it you know see that Indian Americans succeeding more than you are whatever your problem is I'm gonna solve it so it was a symptom but it was also a cause because having someone run for president who voices those ideas who reject so much of the American story and our values was also the underlying cause as well you know I didn't realize until I heard that how much of people stink you really are deploy you aren't deplorable she's right I mean you don't like black people you don't like women you hate India you know that is so cynical of her that she's talking to Indian people look obviously she's in Mumbai and she says oh you know Donald Trump you know people who support a doctor up they hated those Indian Americans no I know that's what you were sitting there going like Hillary or Donald well you know if I vote for Hillary there's gonna be an Indian American gonna come in to my workplace I know that's what you were really thinking
