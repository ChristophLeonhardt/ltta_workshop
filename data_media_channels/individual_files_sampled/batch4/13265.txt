awkward start hey everyone I'm Alicia Crowe I'm Michael Knoll and you are watching Friday live so last week we asked all of y'all to go check out and comment and make sure on Facebook YouTube and Instagram that you are following us and liking us and subscribing to us and all those wonderful things we asked you guys who your favorite social media influencers were because Michael Knowles is apparently a very important influencer who got a picture and from that mural I get to go to that really special mural that looks like all the other murals checkmark it makes me an angel and I we got a lot of been Shapiro's mm-hmm we got a lot of Donald Trump yes which is I mean hello Twitter during the presidential election in 2016 was where he was and it's where he is and yeah and every day since then also so I would say that my least favorite I think is Chrissy Teigen yeah because it's like lefty lefty lefty all the time and then I think some of my favorites are actually the royal family I know that they don't do their their own social media I don't think the Queen is there just sort of Queen Elizabeth is sipping her dirty martini oh yeah with her champagne on the side which I'm like can I please be your friend cuz I would do that with you too like if she's sitting there like sipping the dirty martini and like instagramming stories from their tea parties and stuff that would be amazing I'm sure Meghan Merkel is doing that you know while playing standby me and you know desecrating royal wedding ceremonies anyway that's another that was another time it was another way so uh who are your favorite media influencers try to keep it like pop culture and not political certain well I'm relapsed obviously the president he was the greatest social-media influencer he's actually the best at it and and he's you know obviously the most important one I loved comfortably smug I love Iowa Hawk blog I love instant those raw great ones my least favorite social media influencer is that schmuck who burned the American flag you know Saturday remember you know he's a writer for The Atlantic he's written for I think The New Yorker is room for political like all of these literature has less twitter followers than you so yeah way if you were Twitter for like an ear I know that's true but he's you know imagine needing attention that bad that you burn an American I know it's like I'm sorry that you know clearly you had a weird upbringing you know but sorry your parents didn't raise you right but not an excuse hatched not okay hashtag me too so speaking of hashtags we have hashtag my turn yesterday the new trailer a little teaser trailer for the I believe the final season of house of cards was released and if people are fans sorry you know I hope you watch last season but it kind of set it up even before the Kevin Spacey scandals by the way London Police are now charging him and investigating another three alleged assaults so that brings a number up to eight assaults that you know law enforcement in London are checking out I just can't believe that people who are famous in Hollywood behave weird sexually I'm just shocked I'm frankly shocked it's like they're doing that stuff on screen and then to find out that they're doing it in real life yeah I'm sure I don't know you're an actor I am NOT but there's this weird kind of like art imitating life they say well you know use a method actor I suppose so I guess that's the only way I describe cards is kind of like this feminist tint to it it is it is Claire now sitting at the you know the big throne kind of thing saying it's hurt hashtag her turn her trash tag management has tagged me to you know this is like the classic thing that Hollywood does is the left goes into good institutions and ruins them house of cards that first season was great wasn't even even when like even season two and a little bit of season three was really good yeah but now see that first season you had these great characters that you know Kate Merritt was great in it and the whole show was about this Shakespearean figure who gives Macbeth Ian's soliloquy is you know Richard that they're in soliloquy is to the camera and it was this great take on politics and then they got rid of the soliloquies they reduced his role in the show that killed off sorry if you haven't seen season one one of the best characters and then it became about Claire like it already was becoming that clear yeah who nobody cares about why were they sort of care but it does like that's not what you tune in for and so classic case of Hollywood ruining the thing that it actually like it's starting to imitate real life a little too much like when it's like the negotiations with North Koreans and Russians and the election and her wanting to be President like all this stuff it's just like it made it less enjoyable so the Instagram poll question that you guys should go take right now our daily we're Instagram page is quote will you watch the new feminist house of cards season it is the final season so thank goodness I'll let you all know what I think just you know you can so yesterday we had this information via Twitter as well that James Woods liberal agent dropped him on the 4th of July because this lefty idiot thought that he was being quote/unquote patriotic yeah to quit being James Woods his agent on the 4th of July you know how the left is spinning it to they're saying oh it's James Woods he is a has-been he's not a good actor James Woods is one of the greatest living America like multiple Oscar nominations uh yeah I think I thought he won actually but certainly nominations yeah he's just a phenomenal actor is he like in casino it's one of the great screen performances and anyway and like let me tell you I'm friends with a lot of actors in this town way way less famous people have decent representation out here this was a purely political move and and I love that with woods you know he's kind of done everything so he doesn't care he kind of joked about it on Twitter like look at my agent you know but that I mean that's this town right if the situation had been reversed and he was talking about how great Bernie is nothing would have happened he does have a Golden Globe and he has a couple of Emmys and got nominated twice for das yeah so it'll be interesting to see I've just figured that every agent in Hollywood is a lefty yeah that's true especially if they're able to get you gigs and connections and all that stuff almost all there are a handful of exceptions even even those handful of exceptions have to keep it a secret right like they're conservatives stuck in a closet yeah that's right but I mean hopefully James is able to can you be a self agent I don't know how this works oh yeah represent yourself yeah totally I mean now these days for actors at all levels it like the representation matters a lot less just because the the entire world is my you know much more accessible but I don't know your James Woods he doesn't he doesn't meet a rep you know he's a he's a Matt internationally-known film store like next year see the International film and television star who is here for our fathers TVs here for our father's day and somehow hasn't been dropped by his agent I know that's kind of James given maybe James should call this agent and then he can be a german general and an oscar-nominated film that's true there we go so speaking of movies to this I don't watch scary movies do you watch scary movies oh yeah love security I do not like scary movies life is scary enough I own a gun but if I were in this movie I would definitely shoot all the bad guys we're talking about the purge oh well I don't watch stupid movies i watch scary movies but I watched well if that's not watched something so the joke here in the office is that if there were really no laws for 12 hours people would be able to start lemonade stands yeah I got start a business I could remodel my house you know I could like actually live a good life if we got old rid of all that regulations so apparently there are some quote unquote radical politics in this new purge and people are automatically it's it's a prequel so it's going back to the first purge how many of these crappy movies are gonna be made yeah classic so the idea of the purge is that things there can be lawless and there are no laws for what 12 hours is it twelve hours of 24 hours well in this one you know the the bad guy is Trump they actually have references to the grab him by the genitals video Y and the you know it's this whole flip because they're saying that the Trump administration is racist so what they find in this movie is it's not minority racial minorities who are committing crime just like all those bad Republicans thought it's this and that right it's just a whole political screed and I don't know well if you could if you had no laws for 12 hours told you do let's just say you would be tuning into the alicia Kraus show on Monday formerly Michael Holt you know what I would do it there were no laws I would I would go and you know we were talking about that schmuck who burned the Americans yes I would Antonin Scalia said this he said if it were up to me I would put in jail every every sandal-wearing scruffy beard and weirdo who burns the American flag but I am NOT the King yep I would be the king because he actually I would break into the federal government reserves and steal back every single tax dollar I'd ever spent like given to the government and then I would remodel my house which would actually do more for the economy and for the country and provide jobs for people then my tax dollars are like just sitting there all right deducted yeah I think I mean it sounds like a great day if I could if I could start businesses and beat up hippies that's you know that's a real argument for smaller government so the purge isn't happening in real life if you guys could live you know law free for 12 hours what would you do comment on YouTube on Facebook Instagram message us because we'd love to get everybody's feedback and that's it for this week that's all that's all right we're done I gotta eat way too much today enjoy the weekend everyone see you next time you
