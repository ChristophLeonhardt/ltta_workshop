all right regular brothers back that
gradually shit was dark okay baby dying
and everything imagine my mom ever
writing poetry in yes yet a poem sure
Gus who always said the wedding was a
bad idea
oh wait no our father never fit his kids
at least not very hard before the day my
brothers had with teenage disregard that
he'd be dead before he see a wedding in
our yard
uh oh I could fly the kite oh I'm just
sucking up the word my father made me
come to course but Gus did far apart we
his kite and bottled up the storm inside
his heart it bloody lights I can't talk
him out of it or those who never met him
we don't need a stepmom where the words
no no when the tensile photos came that
ordered him to come here look but Gus
declined and has a sign held up his
middle finger oh shit oh okay I've got a
little kid my dad is getting remarried
to another woman because my dad's wife
died that's one I was as warm
understanding and this is the wedding
day that's what I'm understanding right
now houses kid died wind picked up and
panics disappeared and quickly went but
all the humans did that day was go
inside the tent oh no am I gonna get
struck by lightning with the clothes I
think that's what's gonna happen
rain came down
but no one seemed to say that nature
might destroy the tens are definitely
where's the tent is it hey oh there's
the paper boy Thunder sounds muscular
control of angry college and all my
father makes music oh no
is that a bass tsunami tornado stomach
I wish that I could truly say I thought
about you on that day out there on the
beach alone to see you the wind sea in
foam but I didn't until we found you so
that's it my dad died in a storm she
never talked about it but mom told me
once if I was a boy they were going to
name me Gus
so Gus is my mum's rather I think I
think I I'm not a guy I'm not allowed
eyes I'm of use why do I go whoa are
these stairs climbing oh this is cool
it's like a climbing break my mom moved
up to the loft after her brothers died
oh all those were two brothers at the
time it was as far away she could get
the baby and the guy with the kite
Daniel religion was another thing my mom
never talked about it one but I think it
helped her a lot after her dad died oh
so that's how our dad died on his
wedding day
Oh No imagine dying on your wedding day
she spent a summer building houses in
Calcutta where she met my dad
Sanjay oh sorry I bet you didn't okay
stop doing the Indian accent well I am
in no one doing my mom move to India
week after graduation and got a job
teaching English oh that's cool Louis
was born a year later whoo she got
knocked up by bloody Sanjay I told you
do I do India had sex with Ron Joyce
when my dad died I don't think mom knew
where else to go
Oh Sanjay died haven't all bloody Sanjay
died
I'm sure et was happy to have her back
and to see kids in the house again the
house had to get a little bigger but
Edie with used to that
okay we have to go through it here now
Oh No and for a while things are good
almost normal normal Edith Lewis and
Milton oh no don't tell me another kid
dies put it in my own home no I love
this family
overall the beginning at the end with
Milton's 10th birthday when Edie gave
him a castle
okay Milton all know Milton Eddie Melton
disappeared the only thing he left
behind with a room full of painting
how did Milton go missing did he run
away from home was he sad Oh open the
bloody door window window oh shit
was this all really pudding oh we're
going up real good
I want to know what happened to Milton
why do you run away this one's different
he didn't die in runnin away Milton's
mentioned the magic paintbrush a magic
paintbrush oh look Oh what school ha ha
ha achoo he sneezed
oh shit oh and is a magic paintbrush
look he's drawing a flipbook in a
flipbook listen now flip work is doing a
flip book in another flip book
oh hey boss this is a magic earth brush
so Milton was a payment and now the flip
book man in the flip book man he's going
in a goal which he drew is a flip book
okay that must taken him a long last
time man Jesus Christ that's what we're
going to know about Mel - oh it's
following up to disappear at all
imagine being for when your brother went
missing
ok so I said this might be a long
episode because all we need to do now is
find out about Luis and Edie my grandma
I like this music mom spent months
searching for my brother
oMG still two doors o to that that was
it as soon as my mum's son went missing
or my brother my mum went crazy and then
she locked up all these doors look this
one's glued shut
I think she got so depressed who
wouldn't be I never Milton
now mom didn't want it getting out
nilton sound I guess milton found out
that everyone was dying and then ran
away that's what I'm understanding why
else would he run away from home right
oh okay we came from there let's go
upstairs to the final rooms guys mom
definitely blamed Edie but I think Lewis
blamed well Lewis after he graduated he
just spent more and more time in his
room until mom got him a job at the
cannery okay is Lewis my other brother
that died I think so
up we go or be careful I'm bloody
pregnant okay
I don't want to die please please this
game got end with bloody me dying okay
that's good okay I do not want that to
happen
shit Lewis's room smells very very sweet
that part of him Linda
he's bloody here look at him look
legalize marijuana Emma Lewis oh shit
and letter address the door oh dear mrs.
Finch as Louis's psychiatrist I can
understand your desire for an
explanation as I see it the trouble
began in January shortly after we
convinced your son to seek treatment for
substances he was a drug addict
newly sober I believe Lewis first
noticed the monotony of his daily life
uh okay where he's to work in the fish
factory he kept working in cannery
especially recurring Park in town he's
stopping your bloody heads of the
procedure in our sessions I saw the same
behavior his mind began to the guy who
what what is that huh
wonder wonder whoa who's that
whoa it's like a game I'm the tournament
I asked him to describe it
oh shit
ghazal he said he started small okay
then imagining elaborate elaborate why
she wouldn't she feel his way about and
something moved
what do you mean am i five back and turn
tall skeleton
I have not made what really knew it was
all in his head whoa I'm high but he
took it very seriously
I had hoped he'd find himself
they're just all of my imagination
but he found something more whoa no
longer to daydreaming at the cannery
this is cool I say could it fall okay
but he said Louis's become a model
employee Oh
methodical tireless so forth
yes these came to me about bloody Road
person top-down game like a whole new
Louis Idaho look I ready so don't limit
so I let him go on but but that's not
getting bigger guys
I even encouraged him encouraged this
like it seemed very promising that it's
not okay I know what's going to happen
my hands going to get chopped off when
my whole party's gonna get chopped off
on the edge of a city he named Louis -
Louis Tokyo this bad off man we built
the city up slowly brick by brick
what is nice Lord is God and he made
musicians versus tricky a likely was
probably owns them to play yeah
the quest operatic he talked about
starting band what the shit and he was
always coming something oh my god and
everything as making a chance let's do
that but I might go strong a little bit
he no longer spoke at the camera Oh God
I'm just a dreaming about the shit but
his chopping was as reliable as f oh my
god then one day it struck me what
struck him that all the cheering class
these are the stones under his booth
yeah
all of his imagination yeah they work so
he could do whatever he was yes I guess
what do you want to zoom do it the
healthy next informat did you arrest the
bad it was okay and we won no they
begged him to fish but his mind was
already wondering Oh God
it became again
look and take it up my whole screen do
even no worry I'm anymore I'm setting
sail from Luis Tokyo where am I going
now
conquer city then immediately push on
okay
newest neutrophil hahahaha we're like
this day sweetness ha ha
he started drifting away from our
reality gosh I can tell look at the
shape Minnie happens but little one day
he forgot to go home from the cannery
Oh even as his mother pleaded with him
Artie Lewis kept sailing on he saw my
gosh
this is kind of creepy
he's so delusional newest man he heard
rumors of her a beautiful princess I can
make him gay so let's make let's make
the earth gate make him look cool
okay look easy for breeze he's always
all games shit because of the rainbows
the princess on his own quest for
radiant rainbow yeah let's go let's keep
going going with a Geisha radiantly
followed the sound of him let's go with
it is on because my dad would Indian
sick sister typical one boy my tears are
tears off in his earnest case led him to
a golden palace east of the Sun and west
at the moon war what how'd it go ahead
go even then his logic remain sound okay
knew the world was boiling his
imagination yeah so this is the piling
up guys look I came in static what I was
going on it's just this game but you
know probably that he's very proud of
having created it he was so proud of
having created but in his own eyes he
become something greater than a king
wall you became a ruler
he became gone mooie one hour god of
them with northern end succession areal
attend to the special women someone who
never knows except me in the real world
and then it struck me that the real news
is not the one chopping seven that the
one climbing thought for the golden plan
or its know
because a real human
oh my god
my imagination is as real as my body
totally all continuity
whoa jutsu that's cool
that is cool where am I now
oh I've just left the cannery
I just left began to forget the world we
know
I think it pained him to remember Lewis
the cannery worker what's going to
happen to Luis
wait my imagination guy is approaching
moveth it began to despise the man with
a royal content we with Finch
Lewis
Oh
he's not even doing it look he's just
imagining it
Lewis Lewis I still thought I could save
him
where am I going Luis even after he said
he was being crowned king over all the
lands of wonder is he going to the top
oh no no so oh oh the palace could be
packed with this component oh no this is
all in my head this is all of my head I
think I'm going to these things but I'm
not I'm going to get grinded up into
sword where the fish head where where
the fishes go I'm going to die but I
think I'm not going to die I think this
is what's happening in my head including
the wives calico seated on the Bible

for myself
my soul

Oh

Oh
the rest I think you know mrs. Finch
your son was a kind man who will be
missed by all of us who knew him

you could have met him I wish you could
have met him I think I'm writing all
this down in my story addressed to my
child that I'm pregnant with but Lois
died from beheading yo that one was that
word one was on another level of messed
up these all these deaths are so cool
but so messed up so my brother was a
drug addict and instead of and on his on
his path to sort of get up sober he got
a job at the cannery where he it was so
boring and repetitive that he had to
come up with this this world in his head
and he got so lost in it that he walked
up to the fishing cannery and he died he
got he got chopped up beheaded on the
way back from Lewis's in Iran
my mom told me to start packing that she
waited another day before we left to
tell Edie that's how that's how we leave
it that's how that's why we all left I'm
not sure if she wanted to make it easier
or harder the sooner imagine that being
a mum your two sons dying I wouldn't

they've been an earthquake out in the
middle of the ocean

years
