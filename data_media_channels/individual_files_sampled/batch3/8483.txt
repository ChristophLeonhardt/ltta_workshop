Laura: YOU JUST KNEW THE MEDIA WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME ACKNOWLEDGING ANOTHER TRUMP TRIUMPH. THEY FOUND A WAY TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT AS HE GREETED THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES RELEASED FROM NORTH KOREA. YOU HAVE THREE PRISONERS OF THE NORTH KOREAN SLAVE STATE, IT'S ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, ABOUT THE RATINGS. HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE THESE IMAGES ARE TURNED AROUND. DONALD TRUMP IS A FORMER REALITY PRODUCER. THIS WAS A STAGED PRODUCTION MEANT FOR TELEVISION, MEANT FOR THE CAMERAS. Laura: MAYBE SHE'S HAVING AMNESIA. JUST FOUR YEARS AGO PRESIDENT OBAMA STAGED A PHOTO OP ANNOUNCING THE ARMY. OBAMA TRADED FIVE TERRORISTS WHO PLED GUILTY TO DESERTION. RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, OBAMA, WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED, HE WENT TO THAT INVESCO FIELD SPEECH IN DENVER. THEY BROUGHT IN THE ROMAN COLUMNS. HE WAS GOOD AT STAGE PRODUCTION. HERE WE HAVE TRUMP AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING GOING TO GREET THE HOSTAGES AND EVERYBODY IS HAVING A MELTDOWN. THE PRESIDENT WENT OUT TO GIVE THEM A HERO'S WELCOME. SOME HAVE TO MINIMIZE IT. IT BECOMES ANOTHER ANTI-TRUMP STORY. HE DIDN'T SHOW ENOUGH EMPATHY, HE DIDN'T BITE HIS LOWER LIP AND FEEL THEIR PAIN. SAME THING WHEN HE WENT TO VISIT THE HURRICANE VICTIMS. Laura: LESLIE, HERE'S A YAHOO! HEADLINE. TRUMP CHEAPENS NORTH KOREA HOSTAGE RETURN. HE MADE AN OFF-HAND COMMENT ABOUT WE'LL GET RATINGS AT 3 IN THE MORNING. THAT'S TRUMP. HE'S NOT MAKING IT ABOUT HIMSELF GETTING RATINGS. THIS COMPARED TO BILL CLINTON IN 2009, HERE'S HEADLINES, RELEASE OF JOURNALISTS, BOTH CLINTONS HAD KEY ROLES. BILL CLINTON AND JOURNALISTS, EMOTIONAL RETURN TO THE U.S., AUGUST 5, 2009 WHEN HE GOT PRISONERS RELEASED FROM NORTH KOREA. THE DOUBLE STANDARD, WHETHER YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN OR DIPLOMAT, HAVE SOME FAIRNESS. I HAVE TO SAY, I AM A DEMOCRAT WHO LOVES TO ATTACK THE PRESIDENT EVERY CHANCE I GET. BUT THIS ONE SHOULD BE ABOUT THESE THREE MEN RELEASED, IT SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT POLITICS. I DIDN'T THINK AND I KNOW LEFTIES GET MAD AT ME, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. WHAT BOTHERED ME WHEN HE GAVE CREDIT TO KIM JONG UN. THESE MEN WERE IMPRISONED, THEY WERE IN THE DARK, THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE, NOT GIVEN PROPER FOOD OR WATER OR MEDICAL ATTENTION. THAT WAS THE THING THAT BOTHERED ME THE MOMENT AND THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE RATINGS. IT IS TRUMP. WE HOPE DAY AFTER DAY, HE WILL BECOME MORE PRESIDENTIAL AND FORGET THE SIZE OF CLOUD. THERE IS A LITTLE INCONSISTENCY. WHEN HE WAS ATTACKING LITTLE ROCKET MAN, HE WAS DENOUNCED AS CRAZY. YES, HE'S SAYING THINGS ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO MEET HIM AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE A NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT. A LOT OF THINGS HE DOES IS CONTROVERSIAL. BRINGING HOME AMERICAN HOSTAGES, THAT'S NOT CONTROVERSIAL. Laura: NOBODY THINKS THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES KIM JONG UN IS A NICE GUY. HE SAYS CHUCK SCHUMER AND I ARE PAULS. PALS. THIS IS PART OF THE ART OF THE DEAL. HE KNOWS WHEN HE GOES TO SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12, THIS IS A DICEY DEAL, NO ONE TRUSTS THEM, WE HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF THEM GOING BACK ON THEIR AGREEMENTS. HE GOES IN WITH EYES WIDE OPEN. I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE AMERICANS WHO ARE WATCHING THE SHOW TONIGHT TO REMEMBER HOW THE PRESS TREAT DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY VERSUS HOW THEY TREAT THIS PRESIDENT, HE'S HAD MULTIPLE SUCCESSES AND THE COVERAGE IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR BALANCED. BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TUNING OUT A LOT OF THIS GIVEN THAT THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP FOR TRUMP? WHAT. Laura: THE BIAS, TREATING THE PRESS LIKE THEY ARE IRRELEVANT. THEY HAVE CONCLUDED THIS
