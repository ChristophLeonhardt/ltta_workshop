- inundated with contact for members of our British Armed Forces less to me concerned about our new advertisement not recruit new recruitment videos so I'm going to do is I'm gonna sit here I'm gonna watch our videos what's the recruitment videos we've spent 1.6 million pounds on these videos so that's watching I see what I think so what we think and we look at our rivals you know maybe Russia China we look at their recruitment videos and we're compare the two and see what we think so start with this british army no british time increment see so they're out fighting their own patrol and he's taking his boots off its took his boots off he's washing himself in puddles on the floor and now he's praying and everyone's watching him so everyone's risking their lives so he can pray basically vulnerability oh stop stop stop stop someone's praying stop the war war stops someone's trade no that's not going to happen is it that is never gonna happen you're endangering the other men's life's so you can pray to an imaginary fairy in the sky unbelievable this is actually our I think someone was trolling us with this this is actually our British army recruitment video so I guess there's a sequel not this year or a Hindi one and a Jewish one and a Buddhist one no it is not no just a Muslim one just an Islamic one I get confused with this reason market mainly confuses four times as many Muslims when the fight for Isis is joined by British military so if I understand the big push and when we have had what would the government had is they had a Muslim called off Salomon who's a captain in British Army who trained at Sandhurst who has put up as look this is this is how Muslims can integrate into our country he was a captain in the British Army I had to go undercover to expose him what then turned out was that before he joined the British Army and done his 10 years of British captain he was a radical extremist talking about how the Mujahideen the Islamic fighters will come out of their towns in Britain and attack us to take over our country then he become a captain in the British Army now we want more Muslims into the army that's what this is aimed at there may be some good Muslims in the army who are doing more for this country than me but what is this about right and here's the next one let's have a watch of this one this is the will I be listened to in the army so start off what we're going to be going for is can I have feelings will I get hurt will I get upset you're joining the army yeah bullets shot yeah I grew up with brothers and I've always played sports but I still thought the army was dominated by men and it wasn't for me you've got a man man picking up the little woman not good I felt like I didn't have a voice so I decided to go for it and I joined the army it was totally different mana work will talk over what cause she's a woman that's what this is good I recently commissioned as an officer and now I lead a team of 30 women it feels good to finally have my voice said fine where you belong ok it's about women join the army I'm not against women join army at all I just think this is the advert this is the recruitment video this what the world is gonna watch is our British army equipment growing up I really had my heart set on joining the army my brother was up in Afghanistan hearing his experiences that's when I knew I wanted to join as a medic I was really worried about whoever I'd be accepted but within days I was more than confident about being who I was I'm not afraid to talk about having a boyfriend I thought I'd have to hide it but once you've done it you think oh why why did I make it such a big thing for so long so women now have got a specific video and again gay people to join the army this is our recruitment video women gay people so far let's see let's go come on Steve of them join the army by the way I've seen an extra like can I practice my faith from the army okay so that's not so if I take you well I'm not sure is that supposed to Marian Joseph yes is that supposed to be marrying Jesus is it though oh is it not no I can't be because we won't strengthen that Mike Royal SC faith has always been a part of who I am daily prayers were a huge part of family life but growing up it got harder I got harder because there was a pup but really helps give you a chance to pray when I joined the army I was worried and it's got a big white man look more looking down in intimidating figure on the poor little Muslim standing there all he wants to do is pray whilst at work the truth is majority of companies now big companies have prayer rooms so so far this is the British recruitment for the army I don't say anything kind that young working-class men so far view anything specifically aiming at the to grow you mean as a young working class man you know that one in eight schools in our country are not hitting below completely below standards well I saw an ark we have died about 100 worst schools in the UK there the schools at the army should be down into there the people they should be recruiting do you think you can recruit those young hard-working fast kids tough kids from toughest States with these videos what if I get emotional in the army this is your recruitment video for the army Oh God the priests army it feels like as a man would be a thousand times worse that any sign of emotion would be a sign of weakness that would have it ripped out of us anyway no one is a machine why is in recruitment video fool we told them things I wouldn't even tell my own family there's always someone there to talk to or even just make you laugh 1.6 million pound that cost no see you could have made that in an hour 1.6 million pounds that cost if he was a young working-class man who the majority of people join the British military are young working-class kids from poor backgrounds okay you who the army go in and they make them into men they take them from rough backgrounds with no future and they give them careers that's a great thing about the army okay watching that recruitment video what you join there let's look at the chart let's look at China's recruitment video Hongki watch a to Technica watch a the Suzy Lyall essential confusion aha Judith oh who knows accounted a little geeky potential kochenko I need to play the best toy you get the picture you get the picture now I'm not going to say I'm embarrassed by the British Army because I'm not we're the best in the world I'm embarrassed by the recruitment advert and their barest by what they're trying to make the British Army in when the world looks on imagine Chinese soldiers watching the he'll have recruitment at her imagine that he'll be laughing their heads off look at what you're feeling the next generation of Fighters of maria's that's what we supposed to be bringing as warriors fighters be prepared to battle and kill to defend our nation you want to cry the only client will be praying oh man let's have a look at listen now now we just finished quickly on the Russian one a fully accredited the efficacy of Americanism Cressida we'll very misty pollution see last night addameer I see Oh juice have you a young girl or a young woman especially if your young lad for the testosterone and you join the army to fight to be the best and you watch those recruitment videos are you gonna think they want to diversify our army just for the same thing just for the sake of it let's get to the point of why this is happening why our recruitment video specifically aimed at the Islamic community basically which is what it is let's have a look let's a little listen to David Cameron as I've said many times for a party like the Conservatives just to open the door and say come on in if all you see is a sea of white Christian faces can't see white faces now be bang out of order white Christian faces the country's naughty percent boy I don't get it I don't get the massive getting to the top of the legal profession getting to the top of the business and yes we've showed you what happened with Absalom in the man you were the man who told me in the undercover millions he was going to be Prime Minister we've seen him he was he was an undercover jihadist this is just bit sizing we need more role models like this many more Muslim men and women at the top accredited businesses many more Muslim soldiers in the highest level come on and of course now the problem I have with this why is that then being Muslim got to do with anything why we have a separation of politics and religion you're combining it put a bow in for Muslims involved in politics what American Muslims I'm completely disappointed and embarrassed in the british army recruitment video as are many members of our who are served in our Queen and country the comparisons especially look at Russia look at join look what they're building look where they won that builds so what we want to build look what they want the future of our army to be if you're serving in our army if you're in the Navy whatever you're in and you want me to tell your story if you're feeling passionately
