♪♪ WE ARE ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT WE ARE ADDING 35 ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS TO THE BORDER TO PROSECUTE ILLEGAL ENTRIES INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE ALSO ANNOUNCING THAT WE'RE MOVING 16 OR 18 ACTUALLY IMMIGRATION JUDGES TO THE BORDER. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THIS COUNTRY BE OVERWHELMED. PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO CARAVAN. PEOPLE SHOULD WAIT THEIR TURN, ASK TO APPLY LAWFULLY BEFORE THEY ENTER OUR COUNTRY. SO WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE WORLDWIDE, DON'T COME ILLEGALLY. STEVE: THAT IS SO CLEAR. THAT IS OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL, SPEAKING YESTERDAY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN A BORDER STATE IS DANA LOESCH. SHE IS A RADIO TALK SHOW HOST. SHE JOINS YOU TODAY FROM DALLAS. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL. STEVE: WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE CARAVAN OVER THE LAST 10 DAYS OR SO. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SENDING MORE RESOURCES DOWN TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER, MORE U.S. ATTORNEYS, MORE JUDGES. THERE IS A ONE MILLION CASE BACKLOG. THAT'S A NEW MESSAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE VERY CLEAR TO PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS ILLEGALLY. ABSOLUTELY. SPEAKING PERSONALLY ON THIS TO, HERE IN TEXAS, HAVING BEEN DOWN TO THE BORDER, MET WITH BORDER PATROL AGENTS, SPOKE WITH BORDER PATROL CHIEFS I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THEIR DESIRE TO SEE LAW AND ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THEY NEED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUST TEST TO BACK THEM UP ON THIS. THEY WERE THRILLED WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS SENDING NATIONAL GUARD TO THE BORDER BECAUSE THEY NEEDED THE HELP. TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF AREA THESE GUYS GOT TO COVER, IS AMAZING. ISN'T GREAT TO HAVE A LAW AND ORDER ATTORNEY GENERAL BACK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE? BECAUSE WE MISSED THAT THESE PREVIOUS EIGHT YEARS. SOMEONE UPHOLDING THE LAW AND RESPECTING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS INCREDIBLY REFRESHING. BRIAN: THE BEST PICTURE PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD HAVE FOR HIS BELIEF THAT OUR BORDERS ARE POROUS, THOSE SO-CALLED REFUGEES SITTING ON TOP OF THE FENCE, EFFORTLESSLY CLIMBING UP, KNOWING THEY CAN GET OVER IN MOMENT'S NOTICE, LIKE US STEPPING OVER A PUDDLE. THAT IS PERFECT PICTURE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT FEAR-MONGERING? I AGREE. ENFORCING ALL THE LINES PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS WRITTEN OUT APPARENTLY. TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THE BORDER, THEY HAVE WORRY ABOUT THIS, THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS AS WELL. THEIR RESOURCES BEING USED. BORDER PATROL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS EXPLOITED BY DRUG CARTELS, WHO WHEN YOU HAVE MASS NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS ATTEMPTING TO ENTER ILLEGALLY INTO THE UNITED STATES, THEY USE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO TRAFFIC TONS OF DRUGS ACROSS THE BORDER RIGHT UNDER THE NOSE OF BORDER PATROL, WHO BECAUSE OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WERE UNDERRESOURCED AND UNDERSTAFFED. NOW WE'RE FINALLY STARTING TO SEE MOVEMENTS TOWARDS THIS. I, WITH KNOWING SO MANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE BIT BORDER AND ALSO, DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU'RE BY THE BORDER. THIS IS AN INTERIOR PROBLEM AS WELL. I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION ADDRESS THIS AND FINALLY CRACK DOWN, BECAUSE, LOOK, THERE IS A PROCESS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY. IF YOU WANT TO ENTER THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS JUST LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE DOES, PERIOD. AINSLEY: DANA, YOU'RE AN NRA SPOKESPERSON. YOU'RE MEETING IN DALLAS, THE NRA IS MEETING FOR THE CONVENTION IN DALLAS. I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ADDRESSING THE GROUP? YES. HE IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSING THE GROUP ON FRIDAY ALONG WITH VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT A LITTLE LATER THIS WEEK HE WAS GOING TO BE JOINING ALL OF THESE LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS IN DALLAS, TEXAS. THE WEATHER IS GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL. I HOPE PEOPLE COME OUT. I KNOW WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF ATTENDEES LIKE WE DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR. MEMBERS WILL BE EXCITED TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT. YOU ALL KNOW JUST AS WELL AS ANYONE THE WORK THAT LEGACY MEDIA PUT INTO DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN THIS PRESIDENT AND LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS AND THE PRESIDENT WHILE HE ENTERTAINED IDEAS FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO RESTRICT SECOND AMENDMENT NATURAL RIGHTS HE ULTIMATELY PUT HIS FOOT DOWN YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IS YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. GUN OWNERS ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT ADDRESS THEM. BRIAN: WE'LL SEE BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL STATES HAVE CHANGED. FLORIDA PASSED SOME PRETTY,
