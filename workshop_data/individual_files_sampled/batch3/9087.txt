CHANGE THE LAWS. THEY LIKE HIM. Melissa: ERIC, LET ME START WITH YOU. IT'S LOGICAL THAT THE U.N. WOULD GO DOWN THERE AND IT SET UP A PLACE TO PROCESS PEOPLE, TO LOOK FOR REFUGEES AND WHERE THEY SHOULD GO, WHY WASN'T THIS DONE BEFORE? BEFORE THEY HAD TO TRAVEL THROUGH AN ENTIRE COUNTRY WHICH IS A FAIRLY LONG COUNTRY. ISN'T IT A RELIEF? ASIDE FROM SENDING THE MILITARY TO OUR BORDER, ASIDE FROM SETTING UP REFUGEE CAMPS ON OUR BORDER, ISN'T IT A GREAT RELIEF THAT HE ALSO SAID, YOU KNOW, WE WILL STOP FUNDING ALL THE COUNTRIES WHO AREN'T HELPING. WE GIVE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FOREIGN AID EVERY YEAR TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. IRAN GAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO IRAN, A COUNTRY WHO ABSOLUTELY HATES OUR GUTS AND LOOK WHAT WE GET FOR IT? WE GIVE SO MUCH FOREIGN AID TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, MILLIONS TO HONDURAS AND ALL THESE COUNTRIES. HE SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL STOP GIVING YOU FOREIGN AID IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM. MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T SHOW UP ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. Melissa: PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT'S HEARTLESS. Eric Trump: IT'S NOT HEARTLESS AT ALL. YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY, YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE BORDER. THERE'S AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT THAT SAID THAT THEY FOUND OVER 100 ICES MEMBERS AND ONE OF THESE COUNTRIES. THOSE PEOPLE COULD CLEARLY BE COMING UP THROUGH THE BORDER AS WELL, IT'S NOT HEARTLESS. YOU HAVE A COUNTRY, THEY COME INTO THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. I'M THE PRODUCT OF IMMIGRATION. PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE ANTI-IMMIGRANT OR YOU ARE ANTI-THIS. MY MOM WASN'T BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. MY FATHER'S CURRENT WIFE WASN'T BORN IN THE U.S. BUT THEY CAME INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY. THEY LEARNED THE LANGUAGE, THEY TOOK THE TESTS, THEY DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO. YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE 4,000 PEOPLE WALK INTO A COUNTRY. IN THOSE COUNTRIES NEED TO CONTROL THEIR OWN POPULATIONS. WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A NEW STUDY DONE BY A YALE MIT RESEARCH ARE THE ESTIMATES ARE 22 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS ROUGHLY DOUBLE WHAT THE STATED NUMBER IS. I THINK THAT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MEXICO, AND WORKING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS UNITED NATIONS, AGAIN, IT TAKES IT WHACKS AT THAT KIND OF NARRATIVE FROM THE DERANGED, LIBERAL LEFT, THE PRESIDENT TRUMP HATES MEXICO. AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON WITH MEXICO. WE HAVE INCREASED THE CREDIT LINE AVAILABLE TO MEXICO, UPPING IT TO $9 BILLION. AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE RENEGOTIATION OF NAFTA? THE FIRST PORTION OF THAT IS GOING TO LIFT WORKERS IN THAT COUNTRY, IT WILL LIFT WAGES FOR AUTO WORKERS IN MEXICO, AND THAT PIECE GOT DONE BEFORE EVEN CANADA. SO AGAIN, WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE IN TERMS OF HOW THIS RELATIONSHIP CAME DOWN. Eric Trump: THE DEMOCRATS RAN ON THIS NOTION THAT TRUMP, YOU ARE ANTI-HISPANIC OR ANTI-THIS OR ANTI-THAT, AND RECESS, ANY OTHER WORD YOU COULD THINK OF THEY THREW THERE. WE SEE THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY COMES OUT AND SAYS, THIS IS WHAT THEY DID. THE FIRST PEOPLE WILLING TO SIT THERE AND RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS INCREDIBL INCREDIBLE. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN DO, EMPOWER THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND IT BE THAT FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. CENTRAL AMERICA EVEN MORE SO THAN MEXICO IS THE CHALLENGE WHERE YOU HAVE GANGS, OR YOU HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. AND WE CAN ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH THE NEW UNITED NATIONS OR GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO. THAT NOT ONLY HELPS THE UNITED STATES BUT MEXICO, AND THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO BE MIGRANTS AND FIND A WAY OUT. AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS WORK WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND THE UNITED NATIONS TO FIND OUT A WAY TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND TO GIVE A SAFE HARBOR. YOU ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE THINGS. WHAT'S HEARTLESS AS SENDING YOUR CHILD ALONE THROUGH MEXICO TO BE PAIRED UP WITH A SMUGGLER OR SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE THEIR PARENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE CASES AND MULTIPLE STORIES SINCE THE WHOLE OUTRAGE OVER THE CHILD MINOR CRISIS SHOWING THAT THE PARENT OF THE LITTLE GIRL OR LITTLE BOY THAT WAS BROUGHT FROM HONDURAS OR GUATEMALA WAS BEING SEXUALLY ABUSED AND MOLESTED BY THE PARENT WHO HAD NO DNA CONNECTION TO THE KID. THE PROBLEM IS, ACCORDING TO THE U.S. LAW, THE PRESIDENT IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, TELLING MEXICO TO HELP US, AND CONGRESS ESSENTIALLY GIVES THEM FREE REIGN TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY. OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS DO NOT COMPLIED WITH CHILDREN AS A RESULT OF THE WAY THE LAW IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. SO IT'S UP TO CONGRESS AS THE DEMOCRATS POINTED OUT, AND THE CONGRESS TO DECIDE, DO YOU WANT CHILDREN TO BE ABUSED AS THEY ARE COMING UP AS MIGRANTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS? AND WHY IS IT THAT MEXICAN CITIZENS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LAWS THAN CITIZENS OF OTHER SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES? Melissa: I HAVE TO THINK THAT THERE WAS SOME CONNECTION, PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TARIFFS AND THE TRADE WARS AND THE IDEA WE ARE TRYING TO NAME RENEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS, AND THEN THESE OTHER ISSUES. I HAVE TO THINK THAT EMBEDDED SOMEWHERE IN THE USMCA WAS ALSO CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS OTHER ISSUE? ARE THOSE TALKS INTERMINGLED? AND PROBABLY OVERALL RELATIONSHIP MEANING PEOPLE ARE SITTING DOWN AND TALKING AND COMING UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT U.S. AND MEXICO COULD HAVE AND I THINK NOW IS HAVING. YOU HAVE COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA THAT HAVE TAKEN JOBS AND EVERYTHING, THEY ARE HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD. LOOK AT WHERE MEXICO IS POSSESSION. MEXICO HAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY IN SO MANY WAYS, THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBOR. NO DIFFERENT THAN CANADA. THAT IS WHAT NAFTA USED TO BE, WE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY TIGHT AT THE HIP, NOT JUST WITH SOCIAL ISSUES BUT MILITARY AND SECURITY. THIS IS OUR HEMISPHERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ACTUALLY CLOSER IN HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY STANDPOINT TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ON THE LEFT IS TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. MEXICO DOESN'T WANT CENTRAL AMERICANS ILLEGALLY EMIGRATING TO THE COUNTRY EITHER, WHEREAS BEFORE THEY LET THEM GO THROUGH AND INTO THE UNITED STATES. NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENGAGING THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND ENGAGING THE AMBASSADOR AND SAYING, I WANT YOU TO STOP THIS PROBLEM. YOU DON'T WANT THIS COUNTRY STAYING IN YOUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY EITHER. NOT ALL DEMOCRATS SE NOT ALL DEMOCRATS SK OUT THE ONES ON CAPITOL HILL ARE. WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN MEXICO, THAT SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO HIS FACE. HOWEVER ITS MIDTERM ELECTION SEASON AND IT HIGHLIGHTS WHAT CONGRESS HAS NOT GOT DONE FOR THE TRUMP VOTER IN TERMS OF FULLY FUNDING THE WALL, IN TERMS OF PUTTING FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS ON THANKS RAY CITY IS. THAT IS A FIGHT YET TO COME. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL VETO IT IF HE DOESN'T HAVE IT AND HE'S WILLING TO SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN AFTER THE MIDTERM IS OVER. IT HIGHLIGHTS SOMETHING THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR ELECTION HAVEN'T STOPPED UP ABOUT. Eric Trump: TWO MONTHS AO ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS CENTURY CITIES AND IMMIGRATION. ABOLISHING I.C.E.! Eric Trump: THEY WON'T
