in the Baron in the hospitable terrain of northwestern Afghanistan life is a challenge at the best of times but the drought that has savaged this region has made survival even more difficult we haven't had rain here for nine months it's devastated our community but we promise is said to be one of the worst affected in the district of Cali nor more than a hundred and twenty thousand people have arrived in this one area the lack of water caused their crops to fail so they abandoned their homes and villages Mohammed his wife and four children walked eight hours in search of water we had nothing we couldn't stay no it was hard we had no choice UN agencies are bringing in supplies but so many people are arriving at the camp they can't keep pace with the demand the number of it's much much bigger than we expected and the resources we have is even much less than what we expected so our main challenges actually took at their necessary resources to scale up the response the UN raised more than a hundred and thirty two million dollars to tackle the emergency but that was based on estimations made months ago now the number of displaced people has swelled to more than three million and another seventy million dollars at least is needed this emergency is now into its fifth month and still these people are not receiving the humanitarian aid they desperately need a cold winter is approaching and that will make a critical situation even worse unless help comes quickly so you can see from some of the shelter around I mean people are basically out in the open now that's fine when it's 28 29 degrees centigrade during the day and only 15 at night but soon temperatures will be sub-zero here and people will die funds could take weeks to get through and the poor of this camp don't have decent shelter sufficient food or time many children are showing signs of acute and moderate malnutrition winter is just a few weeks away these basic shelters will offer little protection in temperatures which can drop to as low - 10 degrees many people complained that the Afghan government has done little to help but the local governor says the huge number of displaced people is putting a strain on resources however Monday yes key my dude we were giving 1 million liters of water a day and our water table has dropped to 30 meters at this rate we will have no water within six months the international agencies need to get people back to their homes and feed and water them there in an area with significant Taliban presence that plan depends on money and security no one can promise either for now the struggle for survival for drought victims goes on Tony Berkeley al-jazeera Beaudry's province Northwest Afghanistan
