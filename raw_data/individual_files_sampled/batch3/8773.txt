Tucker: NOW THE ISSUE OF HORSE MEAT. EATING HORSES HAS BEEN TABOO FOR ALMOST ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY AND FOR GOOD REASON. BUT RECENTLY CONGRESS HAS THOUGHT TO CHANGE. HERE IS WHAT DAVE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT? THANK YOU, TUCKER FOR HAVING ME ON. Tucker: THIS AS YOU WELL KNOW, STRIKES PEOPLE IN THE CITIES AS HORRIFYING. WHY IS IT A GOOD IDEA? IT IS MAINLY A WELFARE ISSUE. THE HORSE WORLD IS GONE DOWNHILL EVERY SINCE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE VALUE WHICH IS WHAT THE UNWANTED HORSE IS, THEY ARE SHIPPED TO CANADA AND MEXICO AND THEY ARE NOT WORTH ANYTHING. Tucker: WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH DOMESTICATED ANIMALS; CATS AND DOGS AND WE DON'T EAT THEM. IT CROSSES A LINE. WHY ARE SO HORSES DIFFERENT? HORSES IS CONSIDERED LIVESTOCK IN EVERY STATE IN THE UNION AND THEY ARE ON AVERAGE A THOUSAND POUND ANIMAL. YOU START ETHANIZING THE ONE 50,000 HORSES A YEAR, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF TOXIC WASTE. Tucker: IT IS A QUESTION OF DISPOSING AND WHO WOULD EAT IT? WELL, WE HAVE QUITE A MARKET ACTUALLY. IN 2011, WHEN THE RIDER'S CAME OFF OF THE APPROPRIATION SAYS BILL. I WAS ADVOCATING FOR IT. AND I WAS CONTACTED BY THE TONGUN COMMUNITY AND A MEAT BUYER IN THE SOUTH IN FLORIDA WHO HAD 2.3 MILLION HISPANICS WHO WOULD EAT IT EVERY DAY IF THEY COULD GET IT. MANY ETHNIC GROUPS. Tucker: AMERICA IS DISTINCT IN THAT WE DON'T EAT IT AND THE FRENCH DO. AND IT HAS BEEN A MORE THAN CENTURY POINT OF PRIDE AND BRAGGING OF LIKE YOU EAT HORSES AND WE DON'T. DOESN'T THIS PUT US AT THE LEVEL OF THE FRENCH? THAT IS A TOTAL MISNOMER. OVER 50 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S COUNTRIES AND WE'LL FIND HORSE MEAT INDUSTRY THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF MEAT. AND CHINESE AND JAPANESE AND ALL OF THE AFRICA, IF THEY CAN GET AHOLD OF HORSE MEAT THEY WILL EAT IT. IF YOU ATE TACOS ON THE BEACH IN KABO, YOU HAVE EATEN HORSE MEAT. 1985 HORSE MEAT WAS AVAILABLE ON THE MENU AND THE HARVARD FACULTY CLUB. AND THE ONLY REASON THEY DIDN'T KEECH IT. THE NEW CHEF DIDN'T WANT TO COOK ANYTHING THAT WAS FROZEN AND THAT WAS IN 1985. WE HAVE A HUGE HISTORY OF HORSE MEAT CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THE HUMANE SOCIETY IN THE UNITED STATES WILL TRY TO TELL YOU THAT THAT IS NOT SO. WELL, IT IS SO. IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH GOOINGLING AND LOOKING AROUND TO FIND WE DID CONSUME A LOT OF HORSE MEAT IN THE UNITED STATES.
