1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:03,180
Two Russians have been accused
of an assassination attempt

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,610
using a nerve agent
called Novichok.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,740
The target was
Sergei Skripal,

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,990
a former Russian spy
living in Britain.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,880
He’s filmed here
in a local shop,

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,590
days before he was targeted.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,370
He and his daughter Yulia
fell seriously ill from

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,860
exposure to Novichok, 
but survived.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,910
Security footage allowed police 
to track the two suspected hit men

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,420
as they entered Britain and scoped
out their target over two days.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,370
March 2:

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,700
They fly from Moscow to
London’s Gatwick Airport.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
They check into a
hotel in East London.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,080
March 3:

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,240
They take public
transport to Salisbury

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,490
where Mr. Skripal lived.

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,720
They stake out their target
for several hours.

18
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:45,375
March 4:

19
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,520
They return to
Salisbury by train.

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,310
Minutes later,
a camera films them

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,550
walking past this gas station
just a short walk

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,710
to Mr. Skripal’s home.

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,270
This was moments before
their attack, police say.

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,220
They’re transporting the nerve
agent in a perfume bottle.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,230
It’s then sprayed on 
the front door handle

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,460
of Mr. Skripal’s house.

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,230
Soon after, the men
are seen returning

28
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,470
to Salisbury train station.

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,090
They’re last seen that evening
at Heathrow Airport.

30
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,620
At 10:30 p.m. they leave
London for Moscow.

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,290
By then, Mr. Skripal and
his daughter had been found

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,570
unresponsive on a park bench.

33
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,990
They were hospitalized
and eventually recovered.

34
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,090
Months later,
two Salisbury residents

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,160
found the discarded
perfume bottle

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,110
and were also hospitalized.

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,260
Dawn Sturgess died from
exposure and her partner,

38
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,350
Charlie Rowley,
became seriously ill.

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,990
Police believe the two hit men
traveled under aliases

40
00:01:42,990 --> 00:00:00,000
and have asked Russia
for help identifying them.
